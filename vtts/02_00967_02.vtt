WEBVTT

00:01.415 --> 00:07.863
War was a war of small groups, basically, out by 
themselves. There'd be a patrol, maybe an army

00:07.903 --> 00:18.856
patrol of

00:07.903 --> 00:18.856
anywhere from six to twelve people would go out. 
And they'd be out, you know, maybe four or five

00:18.876 --> 00:22.600
miles from anybody else. And a lot of times a guy got 
hit, he got left, you know, because there just

00:24.022 --> 00:30.730
wasn't any way to get him back. The other guys were, 
you know, they were under attack and having to

00:31.587 --> 00:35.511
fight their way out. And if somebody got hit and he 
dropped, they most of the time couldn't even get to

00:35.631 --> 00:42.399
him, you know, to see what was going on. So it was 
assumed he was dead and he was left. Some of the

00:46.303 --> 00:51.489
fighting was in the camps, particularly among the 
ranger camps that had come in at night.

00:54.512 --> 00:59.738
But they were pretty well bunkered, and it was just 
kind of a...

01:01.979 --> 01:10.351
It wasn't a whole lot of shooting going on in the 
daytime in a lot of areas in Vietnam. It was a

01:10.371 --> 01:13.835
nighttime operation. Do you have a lot of 
hypochondriacs looking for a medical way out of

01:13.855 --> 01:18.422
war? Didn't have a lot, but we had some. Some? We 
didn't call them hypochondriacs. They were

01:25.371 --> 01:26.132
malingering. Malingering? That's a conscious 
effort to try and get out of something, as opposed

01:32.287 --> 01:37.635
to somebody who may have some psychosomatic 
symptoms. We had both kinds. We had some

01:38.957 --> 01:45.848
psychosomatic symptoms of people who just 
subconsciously said, you know, I've got to get out

01:38.957 --> 01:45.848
of here, so they got sick. And, you know, all the 
physical

01:46.349 --> 01:51.697
signs, everything else. They were, that was a 
psychosomatic symptom that they were having. uh

01:57.278 --> 02:22.020
but we had some who would come in think we've had 
some shoot themselves

01:57.278 --> 02:22.020
but they're very much of a minority

01:57.278 --> 02:22.020
we even had them come in and deliberately fail 
their golden clothes you know their urine check

01:57.278 --> 02:22.020
for drugs guys that probably never took a drug in 
their life would take some and then run quickly

02:22.355 --> 02:28.084
because those guys got sent home, even though they 
may wind up with a dishonorable or a general

02:22.355 --> 02:28.084
discharge. It was worth it to them to get out of 
Vietnam.

02:35.215 --> 02:41.184
How did the American military medical system 
compare to that of South Vietnam? Well, South

02:43.367 --> 02:48.475
Vietnam was grossly inferior. Their system And 
much of their equipment and so forth was American.

02:59.790 --> 03:01.272
They didn't have very many doctors. The doctors 
that they had, some of them were very good. Some of

03:04.976 --> 03:07.179
them were not well-trained at all. Their 
hospitals, they had a 1,000-bed

03:09.122 --> 03:16.451
hospital in downtown Da Nang. They were sleeping 
sometimes three to a bed.

03:22.345 --> 03:30.274
Americans didn't take near the number of 
casualties that the Vietnamese had.

03:30.294 --> 03:32.096
And they couldn't be shipped off somewhere. They 
had to stay in country, and they got up just as soon

03:32.116 --> 03:43.869
as they could, and they sent them back to

03:32.116 --> 03:43.869
the war. When I was talking to Dr. Walker, he 
mentioned the MedCap system, but he didn't. Can

03:51.269 --> 03:53.192
you tell me a little bit about that? Yeah. 
Basically, there was a two-tiered structure

03:53.332 --> 04:00.924
there. Besides the military medicine business, 
they also had what they called a cord, which is a

04:01.044 --> 04:16.467
state department, a function of the state 
department, not of the department of military.

04:17.189 --> 04:33.244
These people were there to advise and to set up 
public health programs, industrial medicine

04:17.189 --> 04:33.244
programs, set up little clinics and things in the 
various small communities. In addition, they

04:33.264 --> 04:46.757
would frequently ask us to provide manpower to go 
out to little villages and stuff that hadn't seen a

04:33.264 --> 04:46.757
doctor for years and go out there and examine and 
treat what we could. So once a week, we would take,

04:47.834 --> 04:55.870
we'd go out to some of the little refugee areas 
around Da Nang and have a clinic. And we saw

04:56.872 --> 05:08.374
everything from scrofula, TB, to 
schistosomiasis, you know, every disease you can

04:56.872 --> 05:08.374
imagine over there, typhoid.

05:11.206 --> 05:23.784
many, many things, and we would just take a long 
supply of drugs and give them enough that we

05:11.206 --> 05:23.784
thought would treat that, that would treat a lot of 
injuries, wounds, infections, and this sort of

05:11.206 --> 05:23.784
thing.

05:27.870 --> 05:37.804
But we had that, and we had a dentist would go along, 
and he would pull teeth and try and improve the

05:27.870 --> 05:37.804
dental care, which generally was very poor. But 
this was something that was ongoing at every

05:40.687 --> 05:45.674
military medical facility. We always spent some 
time doing that sort of thing.

05:51.502 --> 05:59.834
Do you think of any problems, looking back, with 
the medical system in Vietnam?

05:59.854 --> 06:00.475
Oh, gosh.

06:03.520 --> 06:04.922
Do you think it should change? The biggest 
problem? was not so much with the system, although

06:10.015 --> 06:16.965
the system is like any system. It's got its 
bureaucracies, and sometimes it is just

06:16.985 --> 06:23.695
hell-getting things that you need. You've got to 
be able to learn to work with the system and plan

06:23.715 --> 06:31.146
ahead and keep yourself stockpiled. And 
sometimes you'd run out of stuff and you'd have to

06:31.902 --> 06:36.589
make a whole bunch of phone calls, you know. It was a 
major pain in the ass sometimes to get some things,

06:36.729 --> 06:42.037
which you could almost always get. I can't think of 
any time we really suffered when we were out of

06:42.057 --> 06:48.226
something. The system was

06:48.246 --> 06:54.635
bureaucratically overloaded. There were a lot 
more administrators sometimes, I think, than

06:54.655 --> 06:59.142
there were people out doing the job. That was one 
thing that's true of every big business. You can go

07:08.615 --> 07:11.520
down to Hillcrest and see the same thing. We've got 
too many people administrating, not enough

07:11.540 --> 07:14.624
people doing the work.

07:18.350 --> 07:28.285
Bureaucracy is one problem, but it wasn't a major, 
and it was a nuisance, but it wasn't a major

07:18.350 --> 07:28.285
problem. The biggest real problem we had over 
there was the lack of support from him. You know,

07:42.904 --> 07:57.546
the average GI heard he got letters from his 
girlfriend or from his wife or from his mother and

07:42.904 --> 07:57.546
father, and he read the newspapers and he saw the TV 
and things like that, and he got pretty

07:42.904 --> 07:57.546
discouraged. You know, here he's over there 
getting his butt shot at, and people burning the

07:57.880 --> 08:07.653
flag in Washington, D.C., and that sort of thing. 
There just wasn't any support, and so it's kind of

08:07.673 --> 08:17.706
a, you know, so what type attitude was kind of easy 
to prevail. And, you know, seeing your friends,

08:19.008 --> 08:24.495
guys that you were buddying up with getting killed 
and and so forth while all this was going on was

08:25.201 --> 08:29.665
really a very disheartening process. And I think 
that's one of the things that everybody who went to

08:29.685 --> 08:54.347
Vietnam carries with them a little bit, is a real 
resentment

08:29.685 --> 08:54.347
at being shoved off there to do and die without 
family or anything for a year or two years or

08:29.685 --> 08:54.347
however long it happened

08:29.685 --> 08:54.347
to be. people bad-mouthing Jane Fonda. They 
burned Jane Fonda in effigy at the officer's club

08:57.658 --> 09:09.014
one night when she was visiting in North Vietnam.

09:11.338 --> 09:24.537
And our esteemed fourth estate, we had a lot of 
reporters and stuff around there, and most of the

09:11.338 --> 09:24.537
time they were in the bar getting drunk, and they'd 
sit down and type out some story that was so far

09:11.338 --> 09:24.537
removed from the truth. We had good ones, too. I'm 
not saying they were all like that. We had some real

09:31.516 --> 09:34.320
losers over there. They greatly destroyed my 
respect for the news media.

09:42.093 --> 09:45.338
I know that a lot of the vets were ill received when 
they came back home. How was that for you?

09:53.913 --> 10:00.642
I think there are a couple of little incidents that 
happened to, you know, people being kind of rude.

10:03.707 --> 10:14.041
Nothing major that I can think

10:03.707 --> 10:14.041
of. No problem finding a job or anything? No. I went 
back. Of course, I was still on active duty and went

10:18.527 --> 10:21.912
back to that. a cushy job. The biggest problem I had 
was going from something where things were life

10:23.248 --> 10:35.866
and death and you got things done to a real Mickey 
Mouse bureaucratic, super bureaucratic

10:23.248 --> 10:35.866
oriented society. It took me a couple of years 
again not to get pissed off every time somebody

10:36.667 --> 10:44.338
asked me to fill out something in triplicate.

10:51.254 --> 10:56.359
I'm

10:51.254 --> 10:56.359
going to wrap this up.

11:00.102 --> 11:11.373
Find out statements from people who implemented 
the war, administrators, and people back here get

11:00.102 --> 11:11.373
their opinions on why we were there and what went on 
and all. From you, a doctor's point of view, why was

11:11.393 --> 11:14.536
America in Vietnam?

11:18.080 --> 11:18.460
Well, i don't know that i can give you one as a 
doctor's point of view because it's impossible to

11:20.465 --> 11:46.641
have a doctor's point of view on that i met a lot of 
people over there and several missionary type

11:20.465 --> 11:46.641
fellas and women i remember i met one a lady who ran 
an orphanage that we kind of took care of and She and

11:47.768 --> 11:55.178
her husband had been in Vietnam for 20 years and 
been taken care of. They had this orphanage and

11:55.218 --> 11:59.744
they took care of the kids and it was up north, up 
toward Hue. And one night the Viet Cong, the North

12:01.466 --> 12:17.387
Vietnamese came in, took her out, beat her up, 
raped her, shot her husband, and took all the male

12:01.466 --> 12:17.387
children off. And some of the older female 
children were raped.

12:26.450 --> 12:30.635
And then they just kind of left.

12:31.977 --> 12:46.615
I met a Catholic

12:31.977 --> 12:46.615
priest who was born in Canada, a French parentage, 
and then moved to Hanoi. when he was fairly young,

12:47.185 --> 12:54.135
was raised in Hanoi, which at that time was French. 
And was raised there, went to seminary back in

12:55.717 --> 13:06.732
Canada, I guess, and then came back to Hanoi where 
he practiced. And he, of course, when the French

13:06.752 --> 13:16.365
were fighting after the war with the French, he 
divided the country. He and, uh, several other

13:17.375 --> 13:21.420
people who were in French Distraction came south. 
Well, uh, he was telling us about how the, uh, Viet

13:23.022 --> 13:29.891
Cong recruited. He said they'd take one man and go 
into a village, and some of these villages were

13:31.293 --> 13:40.324
only, you know, 10, 12 families. They'd go in there 
and they'd call, and they'd have guns. Nobody else

13:43.068 --> 13:44.850
had guns. They'd call out, and they'd take the head 
man and shoot him. And they'd say, I want every one

13:49.901 --> 13:53.344
of you to follow me. He says, if you don't, we're 
going to kill everybody in the village. So all the

13:59.090 --> 14:05.376
males would go out, and they'd take these eight 
guys, and they'd go into a bigger village and do the

13:59.090 --> 14:05.376
same thing. Until from that one communist, he had 
recruited about 150, 200 people, all of which were

14:05.937 --> 14:14.685
then politically indoctrinated and so forth, but 
basically held they would have done in the threats

14:15.020 --> 14:25.598
of killing their family. And this is how it all 
started.

14:32.429 --> 14:38.319
Now, later on, you have to go back in the Vietnamese 
history. The Vietnamese had been subjugated by

14:38.339 --> 14:41.584
just about everybody who moved. In that whole part 
of the world, the Chinese were first. And there's

14:44.812 --> 14:51.081
still a great deal of enmity between the Chinese, 
although there were a lot of Chinese,

14:44.812 --> 14:51.081
particularly in South Vietnam. There were a lot of 
Chinese ancestry people there. But the

14:54.927 --> 15:05.243
Vietnamese have no fondness for the Chinese at 
all, as you can see by recent events. the

15:06.353 --> 15:10.057
Vietnamese were basically fighting a war for 
independence. They wanted to be Vietnamese, they

15:10.777 --> 15:17.324
wanted their own country, and they wanted, that 
was it. So later, when the, after the Communists

15:18.725 --> 15:34.521
became a little stronger, they were able to parlay 
this

15:18.725 --> 15:34.521
nationalistic point of view. into some recruits 
who really believed that, you know, things had

15:35.075 --> 15:40.483
been really lousy under the French. Things had 
been really lousy before that, and before that,

15:41.164 --> 15:45.210
and before that. Why not give these other guys a 
chance? And they taught good, and in fact they had

15:47.914 --> 15:51.539
done some good.

15:55.004 --> 15:59.310
The life of the Vietnamese right now is somewhat 
better than it has ever been before, although

16:00.067 --> 16:06.514
they've still got a long way to go. They're still a 
very poor country. A lot of good natural

16:08.336 --> 16:17.626
resources, you know, hardwood forests and a lot of 
fishing and stuff, but they just don't have the

16:08.336 --> 16:17.626
capital to exploit it.

16:21.330 --> 16:28.437
So a lot of people could see this, you know, but 
nevertheless, it was my contention that anything

16:28.737 --> 16:35.565
that starts out as this started out has got to be 
inherently evil. And that is my reason why I feel

16:37.608 --> 16:46.218
that if there was a reason for being there, that 
must be it. Now, that's not to say that I think we

16:47.059 --> 16:50.303
should have been there. Because I think had we not 
blindly aided the French and had helped Ho Chi Minh

16:57.762 --> 17:25.710
at the time when he asked for help, that we could 
have reverted this whole business and had, true, a

16:57.762 --> 17:25.710
communist society, as Yugoslavia was communist, 
as Romania and several other countries in which we

16:57.762 --> 17:25.710
had fairly good relations were communist, but we 
could have had a lot more stability in that area and

16:57.762 --> 17:25.710
maybe prevented some of the Cambodian and other 
real problems that we have now, or they have no

16:57.762 --> 17:25.710
longer in the country. Uh, why do you think we lost? 
Because we weren't committed to win.

17:46.142 --> 17:48.685
That's all the questions I have prepared. Is there 
anything that you can think of that might be

17:48.705 --> 17:55.512
helpful in my research or that you'd like to add?

18:00.115 --> 18:03.419
No, I don't know. We've got a lot of good 
information from him. Bear in mind, I haven't

18:06.924 --> 18:21.102
thought about Vietnam for a long time, so

18:06.924 --> 18:21.102
I can't think of too much else. It's really 
interesting. I'll just tell you some anecdotal

18:22.765 --> 18:24.707
things now. They're probably not going to be of any 
great interest. I was dual-rated. I was a

18:29.447 --> 18:31.270
physician, and I was also a pilot. So I flew F-4 
combat missions while I was over there, too. And

18:36.741 --> 18:41.289
mostly at night, because I worked, you know, had my 
hands full during the day. You know, you're either

18:43.694 --> 18:48.583
busy or bored, and, you know, I'll tell you. 
Sitting in a two-by-whoops drink and scratching

18:48.968 --> 18:53.673
my idea, not the way to pass the time. It's not my 
thing, so I kept kind of busy. But anyway, I'd get

18:57.116 --> 19:07.607
up, breathe permission, get through working 
about 7 or 8 o'clock, go home, sleep for a couple

18:57.116 --> 19:07.607
hours, breathe permission at 1 o'clock, and fly 
until about 7 or 8 in the morning. And I had some very

19:09.409 --> 19:13.153
interesting experiences. at Da Nang, you could 
not land from the south coming north, because you

19:14.264 --> 19:26.075
passed over what was called Arizona territory. 
And this was territory that was mostly rice fields

19:26.816 --> 19:32.581
and stuff that was controlled by the Viet Cong. And 
this is where rockets came from. And it was kind of a

19:35.464 --> 19:39.127
day-only. Now, we could go in there during the day, 
And nobody ever saw or heard of them, they say. They

19:46.659 --> 19:47.821
were little farming villages. But at night, you 
know, they owned it. And we used to fly over there.

19:52.528 --> 19:57.715
And, you know, the first time I flew over there at 
night, I looked down and I had a navigator in the

19:52.528 --> 19:57.715
back and I was sitting there flying. I said, well, 
some people are shooting at us down there. Oh,

20:00.378 --> 20:01.540
yeah, they shoot us all the time. We come in on a GCA 
final. People down there shooting at you with

20:04.764 --> 20:09.631
handguns and rifles and stuff. And after the push, 
Now, the Tet Offensive, they got down pathway,

20:12.770 --> 20:30.715
which was only about 80 miles from us, and they were 
down into the big peninsula across there, and they

20:12.770 --> 20:30.715
had 23-millimeter machine guns that were 
shooting at us, coming around to turn on GCA final

20:12.770 --> 20:30.715
landing to the south. So it got to be very 
interesting. You know, you never flew with your

20:33.960 --> 20:40.549
lights on, and if you did, you know, all of a sudden 
there's craters all around you. It was really a

20:41.609 --> 20:43.591
different situation. Okay.

20:52.260 --> 20:52.580
All right. And there

20:52.720 --> 21:00.528
was a lot of interesting things. They were talking 
about this body count business. And that was

21:05.053 --> 21:09.557
something that got really grossly overrated 
then. You know, I'd go up on a day mission or

21:09.824 --> 21:18.997
something like that, and we'd go up with a FAC, 
which was usually flying either an OD-10 or an O2.

21:20.499 --> 21:33.937
Occasionally, we'd use a FAST FAC, which was a guy 
in either an F-100 or an F-4, that would go fly low to

21:20.499 --> 21:33.937
the ground, find something, and zap up and shoot a 
smoke rocket, a phosphorus rocket, down to mark

21:20.499 --> 21:33.937
the target. And we'd come in from up on high. We were 
safe from small arms fire, come down, drop bombs

21:39.794 --> 21:41.796
and stuff on them. Then this guy in his fastback 
would zip by and say, oh, it looks like about 30. He

21:48.564 --> 21:51.207
could no more tell what the thing was. Even the guys 
in the slow movies, there's just no way, no way they

21:51.307 --> 21:57.714
could ever tell, you know, what the body count was. 
They'd all come up with some magic number. I always

22:00.477 --> 22:04.782
got the biggest kickback that way. The body count 
on there was just so grossly unreliable it

22:04.862 --> 22:09.447
wouldn't do it next time. It wasn't all that

22:11.468 --> 22:20.037
important anymore. Well. Yeah, there were a lot of 
fun things. We took some, went down to, there was a

22:22.039 --> 22:31.590
ranger outfit that had three guys, and they were 
the advisors to the militia. And it was in a little

22:32.711 --> 22:38.337
village about 25, 30 miles from Jenaim. Right at 
the beginnings of this Arizona territory, I was

22:39.481 --> 22:45.006
telling you about. The V.C. owned it pretty much 
during the night. But anyway, these Ranger guys

22:47.128 --> 22:55.336
were trying to organize these villagers into 
protecting themselves against the V.C. And I got

22:56.938 --> 23:01.282
to be pretty good friends with Provost Marshall. 
And in a combat situation in the Air Force, our

23:01.703 --> 23:07.328
security police which are ordinarily the cops, so 
to speak, become split into two sections. They

23:15.251 --> 23:24.306
have the cops, and then they have kind of like an 
infantry battalion, and they're equipped with

23:15.251 --> 23:24.306
everything up to light tanks. They've got grenade 
launchers and all that stuff. We had a fair amount

23:27.812 --> 23:32.860
of ordnance, and he was always running out and 
couldn't get it from the Army. We'd load up a

23:33.177 --> 23:34.379
caravan. I'd take my jeep, he'd take his, and we'd 
get one other jeep, and we'd go down and we would arm

23:34.459 --> 23:53.287
ourselves with a couple of M-16s and handguns and 
some M-60 grenade launchers and stuff, and we'd

23:34.459 --> 23:53.287
haul a whole bunch of ordnance down to him, and he'd 
give us the cook's tour of all the little villages.

23:53.307 --> 23:54.308
If you can imagine 50 people living on a space of 
land not much bigger than this lot. And in houses

24:04.466 --> 24:13.117
made of cardboard and a few pieces of wood, tin, and 
all this sort of thing. These were the refugee

24:13.157 --> 24:16.842
villages. And little kids running around without 
any clothes, very little to eat. They were really

24:23.730 --> 24:26.033
heart-wrenching. And I could see why somebody 
that had to live like that, you know, when the

24:27.582 --> 24:41.542
Americans in the area, they thought their 
government, that was all they could do for them. I

24:41.562 --> 24:44.206
could see why they might think, well, hell, this is 
all we're getting. We can do better with the other

24:44.226 --> 24:45.768
side. There

24:47.010 --> 24:52.017
was a lot to it. Vietnam is a beautiful country.

24:56.287 --> 25:03.261
And a hundred years when all the scars have gone, 
and that place really comes in, it would be a great

24:56.287 --> 25:03.261
place to take a trip. Great place to take a trip. 
It's a huge, big forest, hardwood forest, trees

25:04.824 --> 25:17.468
300 feet tall, and beautiful white sandy beaches, 
and all kinds of good fishing and things like that.

25:19.642 --> 25:22.007
It's just all badly polluted by man. If we could 
just kind of exterminate man from that whole setup

25:22.027 --> 25:35.754
and then kind of come in and repopulate it,

25:22.027 --> 25:35.754
I think we'd be all right.

25:37.457 --> 25:38.459
Very interesting. I can sit and listen to stories 
all night.
