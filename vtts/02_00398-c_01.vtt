WEBVTT

00:02.832 --> 00:07.579
Esa es la hija de ese que tuvo el accidente.

00:10.043 --> 00:15.991
Su muchachita que dejó chiquita.

00:16.011 --> 00:17.994
Ya fue para Filadelfia ella y vino. Ahora que salió 
de las vacaciones, se fue para Filadelfia y vino.

00:22.040 --> 00:23.382
Antier vino ella.

00:28.790 --> 00:30.072
Bueno, en este... Accidently, that's how it was. 
Some of my friends arrived, my brother-in-law and

00:38.440 --> 00:48.051
a friend, and I was working. They said, where is 
Lupe? I saw them coming. So they said, there he

00:57.822 --> 01:01.746
comes.

01:04.325 --> 01:06.508
Pensé yo algo, que algo pasaba. Entonces llegaron 
y me dicen, buenas tardes, buenas tardes. Dice,

01:18.825 --> 01:21.448
les digo, ¿qué pasó?

01:24.192 --> 01:27.977
Pues no, Doña Lupe, ¿sabe qué pasó? Muy mala 
suerte, dijo. And he was really unlucky. He said,

01:34.731 --> 01:37.075
what? He said he had an accident with Urbano. What 
do you mean with Urbano?

01:47.729 --> 01:48.450
He said, yes. He said, we don't know if he lives or 
not. Because right now he was going to the

01:53.437 --> 01:56.421
ambulance.

01:59.658 --> 02:08.170
Asina was so fast, but I thought at the same time 
that he couldn't be dead. He could

02:08.271 --> 02:13.338
be alive. I said, I don't know what I thought at that 
time.

02:20.308 --> 02:23.292
Soon I told my boys, let's go. Ruri was the driver. 
Ruri wasn't very tall. Porque mi muchacha ya se

02:28.936 --> 02:31.980
había casado. Entonces, les dije yo...

02:33.483 --> 02:54.994
Les dije yo, este...

02:33.483 --> 02:54.994
Les

02:33.483 --> 02:54.994
dije yo, vámonos y pronto nos fuimos para la casa. I 
didn't know what to do because my boy couldn't run

02:56.662 --> 03:03.010
with the car that far. I sat down for a while and told 
my boy, but I was thinking that this couldn't

03:03.030 --> 03:10.000
happen. Soon I told my boy, you know what? I told 
him, we're going to fix it right now. I told him,

03:17.610 --> 03:22.716
we're going to, in the car, I told him, as far as the 
Gonzales family is. And from there, let's see what

03:23.317 --> 03:25.420
happens.

03:28.218 --> 03:42.361
Pronto nos alistamos

03:28.218 --> 03:42.361
y cuando fuimos, cuando llegamos, allí estaba 
toda esa familia.

03:42.381 --> 03:50.013
Entonces dice un compadre de ellos, dice, miren, 
yo los llevo hasta donde pasó el accidente. Si

03:50.033 --> 03:51.415
quiere ir, yo la llevo. Le dije, sí, vamos. The 
chance that he is still there, the chance that they

03:53.986 --> 03:58.852
took him, we don't know. We left. And those, that 
land that was

03:59.453 --> 04:12.568
there, well, we had to, no, they had already taken 
him. He wasn't there anymore. He was there, his

04:14.911 --> 04:22.120
shirt, his coat, it was everything.

04:25.205 --> 04:30.872
No, they said, we asked, the bosses were still 
there and they gave me his. The only thing I didn't

04:30.892 --> 04:35.098
pick up was his watch. Because they didn't give it 
to me, they didn't know if it was in his clothes

04:36.480 --> 04:44.410
or not. Then they say, no, he's already at the 
funeral.

04:53.241 --> 04:53.862
Well, But God gave me strength. Why? Because I 
changed, for the time being.

05:03.858 --> 05:07.103
This street was like this. The big street went to my 
house like this, right? I went there, and she went

05:14.433 --> 05:18.619
here first, and I went back down the street. This 
street was like this. Roel and Juanita there in the

05:24.082 --> 05:26.606
yard.

05:35.520 --> 05:39.446
Good afternoon.

05:39.466 --> 05:41.329
Go away.

05:43.192 --> 05:46.216
Don't come here anymore. So then he says, They were 
there, and he said it was his wife, and they heard

05:50.103 --> 05:56.931
the ambulance. And they all heard the ambulance. 
And they said, what happened? So Juanita said,

06:05.180 --> 06:09.945
let's see what happened. And he said, my 
daughter-in-law, no, we're not going, because

06:09.966 --> 06:17.134
who knows, there's a lot of traffic and they're 
going to hit us. We're not going. So, when they went

06:20.832 --> 06:28.971
to warn this Tirol, they took her to the doctor to 
give her an injection so that she wouldn't notice.

06:29.031 --> 06:32.339
And they came and warned her. She couldn't believe 
it. And we went through there. And we said goodbye

06:39.057 --> 06:42.002
and we didn't get up. I said to my daughter, we 
didn't get up because we didn't want to tell you,

06:42.182 --> 06:51.238
but they already knew everything, but we believed 
that they didn't know what had happened.

06:53.762 --> 07:02.297
No, they already knew, but those

06:53.762 --> 07:02.297
children were not allowed to walk with anyone. 
Those children were forced to walk with their

07:03.593 --> 07:06.596
father all the time. They were the three children 
he

07:07.056 --> 07:12.702
left. All my friends came to the house all the time. 
And she was making herself strong. She was fixing

07:18.087 --> 07:19.648
everything. At night and during the day, she was 
fixing everything by herself. Or just with Ruris

07:25.474 --> 07:27.836
and Bembeses. And I was struggling with the 
children and them, the boys. Well,

07:34.289 --> 07:45.868
we went to the funeral the other day to fix it. And 
then they told her what she thought with him. She

07:48.231 --> 07:53.400
said, no, I'm thinking of taking him to Texas. 
Because there we thought of residing all the time

07:55.884 --> 07:59.790
in Texas. Entonces anduvo ella arreglando todo y 
anduvo eso. Thank you very much. I'll see you.

08:11.322 --> 08:12.423
Bye-bye. Mama, chance que vengan los muchachos 
por la tocadisco. Se la preste a, nomás que le dije

08:18.871 --> 08:24.078
que, nomás, por ella tenía que ir por ella. Pues ya 
saben lo que son los muchachos.

08:32.862 --> 08:45.195
And then she fixed

08:32.862 --> 08:45.195
everything to bring it back

08:32.862 --> 08:45.195
to Texas. All the friendships helped us because 
from the very beginning, wherever I have been,

08:45.275 --> 08:56.727
whether in Washington, whether in California, 
Wherever I have been, they have appreciated me. I

09:03.968 --> 09:11.339
have had many friendships and they have 
appreciated

09:03.968 --> 09:11.339
me well. So they helped us to find him. So she came, 
my daughter-in-law came with him on the train,

09:16.125 --> 09:24.537
with her husband. She came with her two children, 
no, with her three children and her husband. I no

09:36.994 --> 09:43.023
longer live,

09:36.994 --> 09:43.023
I'm dead. It was very hard because I only 
accompanied her in that. Pero yo nomás andaba con

09:47.281 --> 09:51.826
ella porque yo no sabía inglés. Yo no sabía nada, 
pero le daba valor nomás a ella. ¿Ella no habla

09:59.215 --> 10:01.237
español? Ella habla inglés. Es mexicana, sí. Ella 
habla español y en inglés. Sí, porque ella fue

10:07.625 --> 10:12.070
enfermera aquí en Texas. Sí, ella trabajó mucho 
tiempo de enfermera aquí en el Memorial. And my son

10:17.420 --> 10:21.124
died and she continued working in the memorial. 
Now? No, now she got married. Ah, another time. Ah,

10:27.930 --> 10:28.351
yes. Yes. But then, I, my little boy, was not yet a 
man to come on the road so far away. So

10:38.701 --> 10:42.645
that he could drive a car. So... Yo le telefoné a mi 
hijo que estaba en Washington y pues él por lo

10:45.483 --> 10:56.151
pronto no me podía decir si podía venir o no. So I 
called Arizona because the boy who was in

10:57.143 --> 11:02.129
California was in Arizona. So I called Arizona and 
they didn't find him soon. And I had to come. My son

11:11.139 --> 11:20.930
came in the morning and I had to go out another day, 
very early, to Texas. So then I told him, a little

11:20.950 --> 11:26.897
friend Muy amigos esa pareja. Eran de aquí de 
Texas. Entonces me dijeron, mire, no se preocupe.

11:37.215 --> 11:39.621
Le voy a decir al patrón del brief. If you allow me to 
go with you to Texas, I will take you. But what will

11:48.548 --> 12:00.887
happen is that I will be away for a week and I will 
have to leave money to my family to support the

11:48.548 --> 12:00.887
week. And that is what you are going to give me. que 
fueron como 80 pesos que yo le di para que me trajera

12:05.285 --> 12:12.575
para Texas y se los dejara a su familia. Pues 
entonces le dije, bueno, salemos mañana en la

12:13.957 --> 12:19.826
mañana, le dije, para estar. Cuando mi hijo llegue 
a Texas, yo llego también.

12:27.657 --> 12:32.524
Preparamos todo porque yo he trabajado muy duro 
But I have always tried to have good furniture. All

12:38.477 --> 12:40.819
the time. Since I was here in Texas, I suffered a lot 
when they paid the pizca very cheap. But I took care

12:51.569 --> 12:56.754
of the money all the time.

12:56.814 --> 13:03.760
Then she came,

12:56.814 --> 13:03.760
my boy who is in Arizona, He came at night, but he 
didn't call me. We had a garage that was our

13:09.911 --> 13:14.617
favorite all the time. And they were Americans, 
and all the time they looked after my children,

13:14.637 --> 13:23.587
Rudy and the girls. And all the time we dealt with 
them. And this boy never thought of calling me at

13:25.149 --> 13:33.358
night because the bus only came to Fresno. And he 
never thought of calling to go get him. So if he had

13:38.945 --> 13:46.915
come with the car and with me all the way here, but he 
didn't call at night when he got there. So he came

13:46.935 --> 13:55.225
another day in the morning, it was like 9 o'clock, 
and I had left at 4 in the morning to get here to

13:46.935 --> 13:55.225
Texas. And he came very late, when I had already 
come. Y el otro, bueno, entonces

14:01.503 --> 14:11.593
me vine todos esos lugares. Me parece que fue en 
julio, un junio. Yo creo que aquí tiene.

14:18.820 --> 14:18.980
Ah. En junio. Por baño. Sí, en octubre. No. Se 
murió? No. Oh. Oh, no. Oh, no. No, no. Este es. It was

14:31.793 --> 14:35.757
in July 1959. Well, it was so hot in India.

14:42.905 --> 14:48.992
All those places were very hot. But they brought us 
gallons of water and everything. They brought us a

14:55.379 --> 14:59.303
lot, but we always ran out. y muy caro donde había 
hielo. Todo eso bien caro, pero como quiera lo

15:03.541 --> 15:08.987
conseguían, pero venía bien caliente.

15:12.151 --> 15:21.142
Bueno, entonces,

15:12.151 --> 15:21.142
mi hijo llegó, llegó como era en la noche. Llegó mi 
hijo, no sé si, no estoy ahorita segura a qué hora

15:21.162 --> 15:29.712
llegó, pero él llegó en la mañana, me parece. El 
cuerpo. Ya estaba todo aquí la gente porque aquí lo

15:32.214 --> 15:37.599
conocían a él, pues aquí se criaron. Estaba el dipo 
esperándolo a mi hijo. Y llegó,

15:42.864 --> 15:48.549
lo recibieron, lo pusieron en la funeral. Yo 
llegué en la noche. Estaba aquí, nomás entramos al

15:52.933 --> 15:59.099
estado de Texas y fue pura

15:52.933 --> 15:59.099
agua. Llegamos aquí. Todo triste. Las hierbas, 
así. Nadie en aquí, todo cerrado. Entonces, mi

16:11.910 --> 16:20.100
muchacho telefonó por ahí, estaban haciendo esos 
caminos, esos freeways, y nosotros no lo sabíamos

16:11.910 --> 16:20.100
porque estaban todos componiéndolos.

16:22.443 --> 16:28.491
Pero en toda obra de Dios, ese señor que nos trajo, 
pues, él no sabía para acá. Él era de Texas, pero él

16:28.511 --> 16:30.073
no sabía. Entonces ya preguntaron ahí, dijeron, 
no, están en la funeral. Y Angelita, ahí está él.

16:40.110 --> 16:44.517
Llegamos aquí, nos fuimos allá, y ya nos fuimos 
allá a la funeral. Allí estaban todos los

16:44.537 --> 16:46.980
hermanos. Estaba la abuelita. Todas las 
amistades estaban.

16:57.536 --> 16:57.816
Bueno. There was his father, because when there 
was the accident, Reina spoke to his father. She

17:08.407 --> 17:09.429
told him what had happened. He was already

17:10.150 --> 17:15.378
there. So, it would be like 10 o'clock at night, 11 
o'clock, my son from Washington arrived. He

17:24.472 --> 17:25.153
arrived by plane.

17:28.070 --> 17:34.560
Ya cuando acordé yo, estaba mi hijo en el cajón de su 
hermano.

17:34.901 --> 17:36.023
Llore, llore. Hacían como, yo creo, como cuatro o 
cinco años que no se miraban.

17:43.495 --> 17:48.162
Y entonces me dijeron, llegó Silvestre ahorita, 
mamá. Sí, dijo, sí, mírelo, ahí está.

17:54.580 --> 18:02.588
Well, it's just that the other brother who was in 
Arizona couldn't reach him because

17:54.580 --> 18:02.588
of that. So, it

18:02.608 --> 18:10.076
was...

18:02.608 --> 18:10.076
We were there.

18:13.300 --> 18:13.500
He...

18:16.864 --> 18:19.066
They gave him military honors.

18:21.769 --> 18:22.950
They gave him... His flag, his wife.

18:28.294 --> 18:32.220
There is another thing. Always...

18:36.086 --> 18:42.335
It is very sad when couples are not the same. The 
marriages are not in agreement. Yes, this is a very

18:46.501 --> 18:49.866
sad thing. It is sad, it is sad on the one hand. But in 
that, he was there. He

18:57.789 --> 19:09.648
was there, and he went and

18:57.789 --> 19:09.648
told me. No, he went and told me about my husband. He 
went and greeted me. Sunday, German Sunday. He

19:17.801 --> 19:21.186
went and greeted me, and five.

19:24.575 --> 19:29.460
Y pues me dijo lo que había pasado. Pues sí, es muy 
verdad lo que nos ha pasado y todo. Pero yo fui una

19:37.528 --> 19:44.435
madre que nunca les quité.

19:44.515 --> 19:49.821
Siempre les dije, bueno o malo es su padre. Ya y para 
allá. El hijo que quería verlo, está bien. El hijo

19:59.489 --> 20:02.533
que no, ellos sabían. Porque yo les di a ellos, 
hasta que ellos fueron unos hombres, fueron unas

20:03.173 --> 20:14.806
mujeres, conocieron su padre, y yo nunca les quité 
eso. Ellos tenían que reconocer si ellos querían.

20:21.072 --> 20:25.861
Los que, tú sabes que cada mundo, un pensamiento 
cada persona. Sí. Pero ellos se sintieron

20:29.067 --> 20:33.777
contentos porque allí estaba él. Ese día estuvo 
él, mandó las gracias para California.

20:43.212 --> 20:44.233
Y todo muy bien. Mi nuera aquí se quedó, porque aquí 
tiene sus familiares ella. Ella se quedó aquí con

20:48.658 --> 20:51.922
mi mamá. Sí. Luego de aquí de mi mamá, ella se compró 
una casita y se fue con su hermana. Sí. Hasta ella me

20:59.571 --> 21:04.217
dijo que ella nos iba a casar hasta los tres años. Y 
ella cumplió, porque hasta los tres años se casó. Y

21:09.638 --> 21:15.444
ella una buena esposa, una buena mamá también con 
sus hijos. Porque hasta ahorita ella, su, su, mi

21:16.345 --> 21:27.177
nuera, que viene siendo la esposa del que murió, 
que son los, la mamá de estos niños. Sí. Sí. Bueno,

21:29.219 --> 21:37.148
ahorita sus, sus, sus, estos, pienso yo que mi 
hijo, He was a good son to me and he left a good seed

21:38.326 --> 21:47.680
because his children have been good until now. 
Because the other boy who follows her is going to

21:49.402 --> 21:56.873
finish his school next year, if God lets him. He's 
going to finish his school. And the other boy

22:01.580 --> 22:05.025
follows the same. El más chiquito, hermanito de 
ella. Porque son tres hermanos de papá y mamá, que

22:08.791 --> 22:15.220
son mis nietos míos, que dejó mi hijo el que murió. 
¿Ves?

22:19.465 --> 22:28.197
Y yo me siento, yo siempre, desde que Dios me dio mis 
hijos, yo pensé en mí. Que Dios me diera mucha

22:29.419 --> 22:32.363
salud. and that God would let me, until I saw my 
children, be a man, educate them, if God would give

22:33.659 --> 22:55.387
me permission, those, tomorrow or the day after, 
could defend themselves, and they could take care

22:33.659 --> 22:55.387
of themselves. And it seems that it was done, and it 
seems that God granted it to me, that the day my

23:00.912 --> 23:08.382
daughter finished her school, which is this one, I 
was very bad in my heart. I was very bad. I lasted two

23:12.467 --> 23:19.537
bad weeks, but I didn't tell my children that I was 
bad. I only knew that I was bad. Until one night, Yo

23:26.427 --> 23:29.210
no me sentí bien, yo me sentía más mala. Y yo le dije a 
Rudy, Rudy, yo estoy mala, Rudy. ¿Me vas a llevar

23:37.179 --> 23:38.881
con el doctor? Sí, mamá, dijo. ¿Por qué no había 
dicho que usted estaba mal? Dije, yo creía que no

23:44.367 --> 23:48.532
iba a estar tan mala. Luego, luego, se alistaron y 
me llevaron al memorial, a la emergencia. I didn't

23:54.946 --> 24:04.158
feel any shortness of breath or anything, I just 
felt something inside, something that bothered

23:54.946 --> 24:04.158
me. They took me there and then they gave me some 
pills and they told me that I think it was from the

24:04.198 --> 24:11.048
heart. And they said, and tomorrow, and they gave 
me an injection, and tomorrow you take it to your

24:11.829 --> 24:18.878
doctor. Otro día me llevaron y le dije yo, yo no 
quiero que me den medicina. Le dije, yo quiero que

24:25.408 --> 24:27.150
me apliquen los rayos. ¿Qué es lo que tengo ahí? Le 
dije. Sí. Luego, luego me aplicó el doctor los

24:30.113 --> 24:34.658
rayos y les dijo a mis muchachos, ¿sabes qué? Dijo 
que tu mamá antes vive porque tu mamá está bastante

24:35.479 --> 24:41.887
mala. Y dijo que nomás como tanto así no había 
estado el corazón, que yo tenía vida. And I still,

24:49.840 --> 24:59.494
as I don't understand English, but I, as I didn't 
feel that they were attacking my breathing or

24:49.840 --> 24:59.494
anything, I didn't think I was that bad. Well, they 
got all scared and everything, and they said, if

24:59.535 --> 25:10.291
you take care of her, you are going to have 
attention with her. They put her in their house. He

25:13.735 --> 25:17.159
said, and will you be able to stay in the house lying 
down? I said, yes, because I can't do anything. He

25:22.304 --> 25:29.692
said, well, my boys came and rented a bed for me, and 
they put it there, and the girl, the oldest, she

25:22.304 --> 25:29.692
attended to me. When I went, the doctor said, it's a 
life, he said, that I didn't believe, he said, that

25:29.932 --> 25:42.105
you could relieve yourself. I said, because you 
were pretty bad. Why? Because I gave him and I

25:47.015 --> 25:49.860
always asked my God. May God give me permission to 
see my big children. When I saw my big children,

25:54.167 --> 25:59.977
then what God wanted from me. But I already knew 
that he had delivered my children. y mira lo que me

26:04.259 --> 26:07.063
iba a pasar, ¿ves? Pero Dios me dejó todavía. Y le 
doy gracias a Dios que yo quedé buena. Ahora, de

26:18.119 --> 26:22.044
estos hijos, la misma cosa. Es una niña, no porque 
es mi nieta, es una señorita, pero todavía estoy.

26:29.655 --> 26:33.621
Ella anda, yo creo, en 20 años, señorita. No sé. No, 
I have other bigger ones. You didn't see them. How

26:38.342 --> 26:40.284
many children do you have? I have, I think, because 
each child has five

26:40.424 --> 26:52.197
children. Many. Only this one who is in 
Philadelphia right now doesn't have. No. No,

26:56.562 --> 26:59.325
because only here Reina has five. The one who is in 
Washington has five. Ten. The one in California

27:07.319 --> 27:09.261
has five. Fifteen? Yes. And then this other one has 
another five.

27:19.370 --> 27:23.253
Twenty?

27:23.273 --> 27:23.353
Yes. Twenty grandchildren? And now you'll see. 
And then I have two grandchildren. Two

27:30.940 --> 27:31.580
grandchildren? Yes. I have the oldest of my 
grandchildren, this one from Gravel. Two. Two.

27:37.551 --> 27:39.213
Yes, yes. And how old are you? Well, I think I was 
born...

27:48.026 --> 27:49.508
I'm not very sure. But more

27:50.569 --> 27:56.558
or less. I think I'm...

27:56.578 --> 28:04.429
ten or... something. In 1910. In 1910,

28:06.088 --> 28:11.897
more or less. 63 years old, more or less. Many 
years. Yes, many years. Well, that's a good story.

28:27.841 --> 28:29.443
Yes. A lot, a lot... I worked a lot. In California, I 
worked a lot with my family. And not just me,

28:40.315 --> 28:46.243
because my family helped me work all the time. When 
there were holidays, we would go

28:46.283 --> 28:53.453
to work. My family and I, everything was a 
consequence of what I said. Sí, naturalmente que

28:57.447 --> 29:12.190
sí ellos querían algo que de importancia de la 
escuela, sí se las compraba, pero ellos no fueron

28:57.447 --> 29:12.190
unos muchachos necios que dijeron, mamá, yo 
quiero esto, yo quiero lo otro. Como aquí, como los

29:13.572 --> 29:22.206
sufrimientos que yo pasé aquí en Texas, pues cada 
año vistía yo a mi familia, ¿sí? Cada año era que

29:23.333 --> 29:34.564
trabajaba mucho, más en el algodón, porque yo 
desde el 37 comencé con el más grande a trabajar

29:23.333 --> 29:34.564
aquí. Y todo eso lo usaba para comprarles todo lo 
necesario de la escuela.

29:42.051 --> 29:45.935
Los vestía de todo a todo con todo lo que piscaba.

29:48.758 --> 29:50.860
Y cada año Asina lo hacía. My children, the more 
they grew up, the more they helped me. And all the

29:58.124 --> 30:03.570
time, I would gather all of that. And after I 
finished working on the track, I would go to the

30:03.590 --> 30:16.685
town, my whole family, and I would buy three for 
each person who had clothes for school. Yes. Yes,

30:17.165 --> 30:18.687
for each boy. three, four things for each one, so 
that they could continue their school. Well, when

30:26.498 --> 30:35.609
the year came, I had to save money for when the work 
came back. I already had little, little, so much

30:35.709 --> 30:42.177
clothes I needed. shoes, clothes, or something 
that was more important, I had to buy it with that

30:42.663 --> 30:56.999
money that was raised, or there were 
opportunities to work for two or three days. I used

30:57.239 --> 31:00.703
that for what I needed the most. Yes. Asina did it, 
and I did it all my life. You see? Ese yo enseñé a

31:08.971 --> 31:14.039
todos estos niños a cuidar. ¿Quién sabe? No sé. 
Pero años muy pasados, en el café, daban un peso en

31:18.647 --> 31:28.382
cada bote de café. Era un cheque que mandaban. 
Entonces, todo el tiempo procurábamos esa clase

31:33.524 --> 31:38.291
de café. Uno era porque nos gustaba. Y de lejos en 
lejos llegó a juntar mi muchacho cinco pesos del

31:42.256 --> 31:50.187
café.

31:52.871 --> 32:00.882
Y entonces, él,

31:52.871 --> 32:00.882
el daime, el nikle, él alzaba. He would give her 
some five-pesos alcancillas. If there was any

32:05.555 --> 32:08.559
damage, he would give her some. He would throw them 
at her. Even the one that killed himself. He would

32:13.604 --> 32:19.391
raise them until he would fill his alcancillas 
with five pesos. When there was no more money, he

32:19.411 --> 32:24.297
would say, Mom, I have it. I have it. And if I didn't 
tell him, he would say, look, there's no money. Go

32:28.702 --> 32:31.645
and take it out of the alcancillas. That's how they 
were taught. And he had a wife that they would go to

32:34.908 --> 32:41.377
eat and they were both in agreement with that. 
Because that's how it was taught. Because he, the

32:45.542 --> 32:51.971
older one started to bring the mandao. They would 
carry it. They, their friends, would take the food

32:55.739 --> 33:02.732
to the house, to this older boy. Then the little 
boy, the second one, would go to the village. They

33:08.362 --> 33:11.167
would carry their food. There were four of us where 
we lived in the village. Ellos no cargaban, ellos

33:13.812 --> 33:31.318
iban, y ellos iban a dejar al doctor pues más, 
porque yo los doctores a mí me conocían y gracias a

33:13.812 --> 33:31.318
Dios, donde quiera que iba con mis hijos, este 
doctor, el otro doctor, que ya murieron unos, pero

33:13.812 --> 33:31.318
todavía existe el STON. Ellos, iba yo, y si no iba 
yo, iban ellos. Dice mi mamá, dice que usted me haga

33:38.188 --> 33:41.173
esto. Está bueno. ¿Por qué? Porque yo dejaba de 
comer por pagarle al doctor. Sí, ya les pasaba una

33:49.320 --> 34:00.262
vez, se ganchó mi muchacho con un anzuelo por allá 
en el arroyo, pescando aquí, yo ni sabía, y se

33:49.320 --> 34:00.262
fueron de por allá luego, luego al doctor. ¿Qué te 
pasó? Dice, pues mire, dice, Tu mamá no sabe, dice,

34:05.332 --> 34:07.214
no. Y se los sacó el doctor, el anzuelo. Yo no 
necesité pagar. Cuando iba yo no necesitaba

34:13.843 --> 34:19.170
pagar, nomás me hacía vil, pero ella me conocía y 
conocía a mis niños. De modo desde que si mis niños

34:19.871 --> 34:26.479
estaban malos, yo no batallaba, porque yo tenía 
doctor. Because I paid all the time. And I had

34:29.409 --> 34:31.711
amistades with them and I knew them. See? That's 
why I never mortified myself. Never from my

34:37.436 --> 34:38.437
family. That I say, one broke a foot, one broke an 
arm. Because I was at home all the time. And I never

34:46.065 --> 34:47.246
let them go there. Nor that they were playing with 
this and that. No. Why? Because I didn't have money

34:51.870 --> 34:55.774
to cure them if something happened to them. The 
only one I took care of was when my baby, Roel, was 40

34:57.003 --> 35:02.514
days old. When he was little, he got hit by the 
ferret. He got hit by the rodents, he got hit by the

35:10.109 --> 35:17.965
scorpion, and after that he got attacked by the 
ferret. Y como estaba así natan bebito y todo eso,

35:19.109 --> 35:26.302
yo los tuve y lleve con el doctor y yo gasté como 20 
pesos. Ya no tenía dinero y el doctor no me cobraba,

35:27.143 --> 35:36.460
pero las medicinas tenía que comprarlas y no le 
hacían las medicinas al bebito, ni podía

35:27.143 --> 35:36.460
tomarlas. Entonces yo, dijo el doctor, mira, 
dijo, I can't take your baby anymore, I don't have

35:42.430 --> 35:51.642
the tools here, but I'm going to give you a paper so 
that you can pass your baby to the memorial. And

35:52.263 --> 35:57.330
with this paper they will take care of you. So I 
looked at my baby and he was already gone. I just

36:02.297 --> 36:07.864
touched his heart, I knew he was alive because his 
heart was just blue. So, at night, it was like 3 in

36:09.177 --> 36:18.777
the morning, when he got even more late, because he 
couldn't take his medicines anymore. So, I told

36:19.138 --> 36:26.072
him, my husband was there, and I said, look, here's 
this paper, look for someone to take him to the

36:19.138 --> 36:26.072
hospital. Then he went to the mayor and told him to 
lend him a piece of furniture to carry him. And he

36:32.529 --> 36:36.354
started to cry, my lord, he started to cry. Why? 
Because there was no money to carry him. I told him,

36:39.318 --> 36:41.682
we don't need money. Because with this paper we 
have... How are we going to let him die? If with this

36:47.030 --> 36:52.317
paper they have to take care of us, let's go. And 
then I took him to the church. It was like this, like

36:55.415 --> 36:58.619
this, like this, the baby. We got to Liles and I 
talked to the father. Father, I told him to bring

37:01.644 --> 37:03.887
the very bad child. He said, bring him. And he 
already blessed him and everything. And I knew

37:11.197 --> 37:16.764
that he was going to live because of the heart. We 
got there, they put him in the bed there, and loose.

37:22.713 --> 37:25.236
So we told them, and then we gave him the paper. 
Entonces dice, llévenlo, entonces le pusieron

37:27.410 --> 37:32.757
una inición ellos. Entonces dicen, llévenlo para 
el cuartito donde están todos los bebitos, le

37:33.758 --> 37:37.763
dijeron a las enfermeras. Por lo llevamos allá. 
Bueno, ¿qué piensa usted que son las cosas más

37:41.007 --> 37:46.494
importantes de la vida? Usted, claro usted, las 
cosas más importantes de una vida buena. Tocante a

37:53.963 --> 37:56.006
la familia. Sí. Well, right now, with all of this, 
with the touch of the family, and how I raised my

37:57.886 --> 38:24.467
family, well, the most important thing, and what 
sometimes, now, is forcing us to lose our youth, is

38:26.489 --> 38:39.863
Muchos padres por...

38:26.489 --> 38:39.863
Muchos padres porque quieren trabajar. Porque yo 
he oído que no pueden sostener la familia porque

38:41.965 --> 38:48.472
son muchos. Y que por eso trabajan. Pero no pienso 
yo que sea Sina. Because I mean that there are many

38:58.754 --> 39:13.920
families, and I know people who have had up to 20, 25 
families in the ranches that I know. And those

39:15.684 --> 39:21.133
families had to maintain those families. No para 
darles escuela, porque muchos. Pero esa es la

39:26.008 --> 39:29.994
voluntad de la persona, de los padres. Porque 
cuando la gente tiene voluntad y se apura por sus

39:31.316 --> 39:50.605
hijos, así como se mortifica de darles un consejo 
para que no hagan un mal, así no tienen que

39:31.316 --> 39:50.605
mortificarse para su dedicación de ellos. ¿Por 
qué? El trabajo es toda la vida. Esto no hay nomás

39:55.901 --> 40:00.167
una vez, que es la de su juventud. Terminar su 
escuela, o aunque sea una parte de su escuela, para

40:00.187 --> 40:12.805
su, su, de él, de su futuro de ellos. Because the 
future, the parents are already behind. The ones

40:17.891 --> 40:22.919
who are going to fight are the children. And they 
need to study so that those children get married,

40:22.999 --> 40:37.963
they have to take care, work hard to keep their 
children. And that's what they need. I didn't have

40:39.751 --> 40:44.075
a degree, but I did. I looked a lot, and I sacrificed 
a lot, as you have no idea, for them to have a school,

40:44.956 --> 40:58.230
and to dress them when they earned so little. And I 
took care of the cent a lot. That's what I'm saying.

41:09.335 --> 41:18.548
Now there are many opportunities for children to 
go to school. You don't know how much I get

41:20.210 --> 41:31.345
mortified when I see the children of other people 
who don't go to school. Like all the classes that

41:31.365 --> 41:33.568
exist right now, All these classes cost money. All 
this, look. Everything is pure money. You do one of

41:40.683 --> 41:44.993
these things, you help yourself a lot. Ahora la 
gente mejor quiere ver las historias, mejor

41:46.829 --> 42:07.971
quiere platicar, mejor que no creo yo que no tenga 
tiempo para agarrar dos, tres horas para hacer

41:46.829 --> 42:07.971
toda clase de lo que nos están ayudando ahorita, 
para el beneficio de uno. Ahorita no tiene la gente

42:09.293 --> 42:16.380
necesidad de decir, quiero que me preste un peso. 
Because if you sell anything, you make a living.

42:22.908 --> 42:33.262
Because we don't all want to work, we want to make a 
living and do it. And that's what I've always

42:33.282 --> 42:37.788
wanted. And always when I hear and look, I'm 
against it. From those parents who don't send

42:44.187 --> 42:52.784
their children to school, who look, those boys are 
just walking down the street. Those girls are just

42:52.804 --> 42:57.152
walking down the street. The parents are working, 
working because they don't complete what the

42:58.354 --> 43:05.368
father earns. Esa familia está sola desde 
chiquita, está sola en las casas. No saben qué

43:10.007 --> 43:15.004
están haciendo esos hijos en la casa. They don't 
know if they are going to this part or that part.

43:18.546 --> 43:20.968
They don't know anything about that. Why? Because 
they are working. The parents, those who are not

43:23.991 --> 43:29.156
working during the day, work at night in the 
canteen. They don't know who comes in and who goes

43:30.577 --> 43:33.801
out, or anything about the house. Why? Because 
they come in at night and leave at night. And they

43:38.785 --> 43:41.768
don't know anything about how that house is being 
treated.

43:44.414 --> 43:51.202
Cuando el papá sale fuera de la casa, está la mamá en 
la casa. Pero la mamá debe de saber, y es la que sabe

43:52.003 --> 43:57.610
más a veces que los papaces. Que las mamaces saben 
todo lo de los hijos. No más que habemos mamaces que

44:02.957 --> 44:07.022
tapamos la cosa. Y no sirve. No sirve porque hay día 
que eso no está bueno. It's not good that if the

44:13.642 --> 44:21.810
child does something wrong, I don't tell the 
father because the father can hit him and he can do

44:13.642 --> 44:21.810
it. But if the mother can't correct that bad thing, 
why doesn't she let the father do it? Now, if the

44:30.179 --> 44:37.086
father is going to do a good thing, why does the 
mother tell him, don't hit him or leave him? No, it

44:37.666 --> 44:42.231
must be like that because he is correcting the bad 
thing. And that's what I see, that it's not right.

44:47.386 --> 44:58.759
And that's why all this that is happening now in the 
youth is because the government is not at home.

44:59.920 --> 45:02.744
That's what happens. I, look, I go here or I go there 
with my family. Very few tell me. But when they come

45:11.633 --> 45:14.597
to me and say, look, you are doing wrong. And you 
don't do this and this. I'm going to do this. Don't

45:19.824 --> 45:23.790
do this because it's wrong. And who causes it? You 
don't attend here in the house. That's why. And if

45:30.199 --> 45:31.701
you know it, you don't tell him. I didn't go to SINA. 
I very little was in my lord.
