00:00.976 --> 00:14.637
At A&M, man, no, if you belong to fraternity, I 
remember back in there, this Preacher Durst that

00:00.976 --> 00:14.637
became vice president of Brown and Root, he was a 
fraternity man. And the summer vacation between

00:14.657 --> 00:29.160
my freshman year and sophomore year, Preacher had 
gotten a letter from Dr. Bazell. saying that they

00:30.187 --> 00:38.337
were clamping down on student activities, 
hazing, and fraternities. They knew

00:38.417 --> 00:42.963
fraternities existed at A&M, but they didn't have 
enough proof. But if they found out that a student

00:43.504 --> 00:49.492
was a fraternity man, they were going to expel him. 
That's right. So a preacher told me about it that

00:52.936 --> 00:55.319
summer. He said, we've been sent this letter. And 
if any of us belong to fraternities, when we go

01:01.034 --> 01:08.606
back, if they find it out, we expect to be expelled. 
Well, he wasn't expelled. But

01:14.595 --> 01:22.988
my captain was a good officer. He's dead and gone. 
But he was a good officer, a swell person. And so was

01:30.110 --> 01:33.494
the major of the cavalry that year. My freshman 
year, I cleaned up his room. Old Dusty Dodson from

01:36.058 --> 01:38.601
Amarillo, Texas. And he was a good major. They were 
all good men. I didn't know a single one that wasn't

01:43.047 --> 01:47.573
an outstanding individual.

01:50.296 --> 01:58.427
And as far as I was concerned, they did a lot of good 
for Texas A&M. But we suspended those football

02:00.535 --> 02:02.358
players. We suspended them until the second 
semester, I believe, of the following year. Of

02:09.970 --> 02:17.643
course, the second semester of that year was about 
over, so they were allowed to finish that

02:09.970 --> 02:17.643
semester. But they were not going to be allowed to 
come back in until the second semester of the

02:17.663 --> 02:22.411
following year. But they came back in in September 
of that year. To play football. The chairman of the

02:29.960 --> 02:33.165
board. And I don't know who else. And now you 
suspect. And here was another name that was read

02:37.251 --> 02:40.616
off, too. And he was, well, anyhow.

02:46.765 --> 02:50.290
The ex-students association of Texas A&M. I just 
wondered, too, how long they were operating under

02:50.310 --> 02:54.977
the TTs. That's just my idea. I know that one of the

03:01.294 --> 03:12.768
executive directors was T.T.

03:15.292 --> 03:18.956
Whether his followers were or not, I wouldn't 
know. I care less. It really doesn't matter

03:21.399 --> 03:25.825
because, as I said, they were all good men. And 
whatever they did, they did it for A&M, and I don't

03:26.395 --> 03:34.448
believe you could have gotten a truer Aggie 
anywhere than those fellows. Now, we've talked

03:35.870 --> 03:42.301
about a lot of changes in vet medicine from the 
1930s to the 1960s. There must have been something

03:42.421 --> 03:45.787
that I've missed that we should talk about. Do you 
have any ideas about that? I mean, I'm certainly no

03:48.371 --> 03:51.576
expert in veterinary science, that's for sure.

03:54.610 --> 03:57.713
No, the big thing is that we have improved. And I 
think now that the College of Veterinary Medicine

03:57.813 --> 04:07.202
at A&M is an outstanding institution, I think it is 
head and shoulders. Well, there is no comparison

04:07.282 --> 04:12.107
now to what we were in the 30s. We were nothing in the 
30s. Absolutely. And how we ever got the board of

04:16.892 --> 04:22.457
directors to put on a big building program for us In 
1931, when we had but one graduate in 1930, must

04:22.842 --> 04:30.053
have been politics. Here they built it where civil 
engineering is now. All of that sprang up. And

04:37.305 --> 04:39.348
before that, we just had some shacks. We had 
Francis Hall, of course, but it was terribly run

04:39.909 --> 04:47.722
down and nothing in it except in physiology and 
pharmacology. Nothing. But we've spread out all

04:52.475 --> 05:03.486
over creation now and have, I don't know, 150 men on 
the staff, not to mention technical help galore.

05:04.006 --> 05:07.410
They have three or four or five in veterinary 
anatomy. When I was crying for all the years I was in

05:07.450 --> 05:16.619
there for one person and didn't get that until 15 
years later. No.

05:21.382 --> 05:23.985
There's no comparison. As a final question, then, 
I'd like to ask you to evaluate your own career.

05:32.896 --> 05:34.919
I wouldn't know how to evaluate it. I work like a 
fool, and that's about all I can say. But I'm proud

05:40.426 --> 05:42.208
of what I did. I gave them something in both 
departments to build on.

05:52.330 --> 05:53.492
You were appreciated. When we were down and out, 
then I was there in the breach. And we built from

06:02.505 --> 06:05.729
there. And we certainly had nothing when I went in. 
Well, were there things during your about 30 years

06:08.774 --> 06:14.001
that you wanted? 35 years that you wanted to do, 
which you just couldn't accomplish, not

06:14.723 --> 06:27.759
necessarily because of your own self, but because 
of other outside circumstances or other

06:14.723 --> 06:27.759
shortcomings, especially in your own 
department?

06:30.723 --> 06:36.850
Well, I'd like to have built a department up to 
where we could have had a big research program We

06:37.150 --> 06:40.815
could have had 10 or 12 staff members and so on. But 
the money wasn't there.

06:49.326 --> 06:49.747
I don't know. To begin with, I was never too sold on a 
person teaching and researching. I wasn't too

06:59.720 --> 07:01.422
sold on that. I thought, if you're going to teach 
what teach, and if you're going to research, do

07:02.524 --> 07:07.090
that. give all of your time to one or the other. 
Because as I could see it then, you needed all of the

07:10.836 --> 07:22.753
time you had and more to prepare yourself for 
teaching. To do all of the research, the reading in

07:22.773 --> 07:33.147
research and so on, and keep up with your field, 
that would leave very little time for any

07:22.773 --> 07:33.147
research. You couldn't keep your mind, unless you 
were given A third of your time where you had

07:38.727 --> 07:42.673
nothing else to do but research. If you had to carry 
research along with your teaching, one or the

07:43.454 --> 07:49.303
other is going to suffer. I still think that. Or you 
are like some of the professors I've had who were

07:52.609 --> 07:58.177
doing research. They get you off on their research 
project, and that's about all they know to talk

07:58.818 --> 08:03.165
about.

08:05.963 --> 08:08.886
Uh, you mean old pine tree so-and-so? Are you 
talking about Dr. Old Pine Tree So-and-So? That's

08:12.691 --> 08:19.879
about all he talked in his course on the pine tree 
because he did his PhD on the life cycle of the pine.

08:22.863 --> 08:32.354
I know what

08:22.863 --> 08:32.354
you mean.

08:32.374 --> 08:34.536
No, I'd like to have been two or three people. and I 
can put one of them over in research and one of them

08:34.938 --> 08:44.990
teaching and one of them reading up in research and 
so on, work in the library, references over. You

08:45.911 --> 08:51.838
just don't, you can't spread yourself out unless 
you have an elaborate personnel. You're not gonna

08:53.520 --> 08:55.763
do much in the way of research. If it's all up to you 
and you have to teach too, you have nobody to help

08:55.843 --> 09:04.573
you, you might as well forget your research. I 
still feel that. Unless you have adequate help,

09:09.239 --> 09:16.188
your research isn't going to be worth a 
continental. Well, you won't be able to produce

09:18.211 --> 09:20.934
anything in a lifetime.

09:25.721 --> 09:32.670
As far as accomplishments, then, on your career,

09:25.721 --> 09:32.670
could you sum that up for me? No, I'd have to be 
satisfied with what I did, but I just didn't feel

09:33.140 --> 09:40.992
that I did enough. I wasn't

09:41.012 --> 09:49.485
physically capable or mentally either, I guess, 
to do more. I did all I could for veterinary

09:51.528 --> 09:56.736
medicine and that was it. And I think I've been 
appreciated. I think my students appreciated me.

10:01.658 --> 10:05.883
I think the wall in that room of yours demonstrates 
that. Well, what I was after was turnout solid

10:05.903 --> 10:12.752
veterinarians. I tell my students, you go out and 
practice, and if you don't know any more about

10:14.434 --> 10:30.855
diseases than the vocational ag teacher or the 
county agent, you're not going to be worth your

10:14.434 --> 10:30.855
salt. He can see from his eyes out. He can tell you 
that that's hog collar or that's black legs. He

10:41.706 --> 10:44.670
knows the signs. But can he think in terms of that 
disease? What is happening in that animal's body?

10:51.659 --> 10:54.843
What is happening within the cell? What can you do 
to Stop this disease in that cell. What medicines

11:03.100 --> 11:04.923
are you going to give? What is the interaction of 
the medicine with the disease process? That's

11:09.909 --> 11:16.897
something that your county agent and your 
vocational ag man won't be able to solve. He knows

11:17.838 --> 11:19.600
what he has. But what's taking place, and that's 
what I want you to be capable of. I want you to be able

11:25.628 --> 11:47.150
to take it down even to the chemistry or even into 
the electron microscope, into the small

11:25.628 --> 11:47.150
particles that are within the cytoplasm of the 
cell or within the little particle that's in the

11:25.628 --> 11:47.150
cytoplasm of the cell. I want you to be able to see 
all the way through, not just from your nose out.

11:55.278 --> 11:58.122
And unless you do, you're just a plain old quack. 
That's it. And I did everything I could to get

12:02.067 --> 12:12.381
anatomy over, especially microscopic anatomy. 
The gross anatomy to me didn't matter very much.

12:16.587 --> 12:21.353
But the microscopic did, because this is where 
Everything works down in that cell. And I said,

12:27.519 --> 12:38.051
unless you know your normal tissues, you're not 
going to have a basis to build the abnormals on.

12:38.071 --> 12:41.575
That's just like the little girl in histology in 
medical school. When we finished the course in

12:41.635 --> 12:49.804
histology, there were two or three abnormal 
slides of lung tissue. She looked at those. Of

12:53.905 --> 12:55.447
course, pathologic. She didn't know what she was 
looking at. But she had completed a course in

12:57.769 --> 13:04.137
normal cell study, histology. She should have 
recognized lung and that there was something

13:04.157 --> 13:11.065
wrong with it. She called the professor and said, I 
don't know what's wrong with this lung. It's

13:17.892 --> 13:19.234
labeled abnormal. It has holes in it, just like 
that other lung I looked at. I thought,

13:23.732 --> 13:28.577
you poor thing. If that is all that you have gotten 
out of a course in histology, you may as well not

13:29.378 --> 13:36.385
have taken it. It has holes in it. This was a section 
of lung that showed chronic passive congestion.

13:45.590 --> 13:50.557
The alveolar walls were three or four times as 
thick as they normally should be. There was

13:50.617 --> 13:52.900
emphysema. Some of the spaces were many times, 20 
times the size that they should be, and those walls

13:52.920 --> 14:02.553
were stretched thin. There were heart lesion 
cells, phagocytic cells that had picked up blood

14:03.815 --> 14:12.767
pigment in the alveolar spaces. She didn't see it. 
This was lung because it had holes in it. And that's

14:20.542 --> 14:24.406
all she had to build on in her pathology. And I said, 
I surely would hate to be your pathology

14:24.446 --> 14:30.853
instructor, because you have nothing to build on. 
In my way of teaching histology, they had as much

14:33.035 --> 14:39.281
pathology as they had histology. We showed them 
the normal. And then we compared it with

14:41.260 --> 14:44.165
abnormalities. I didn't have to name the 
abnormality. If it was low bar pneumonia or

14:48.491 --> 15:03.415
adenocarcinoma

14:48.491 --> 15:03.415
of the liver or just a plain old cirrhosis of the 
liver or pancreas or what are you, kidneys or what?

15:03.435 --> 15:09.124
My training in pathology allowed me to show him the 
normal and impress on him what that normal is. And

15:12.224 --> 15:15.528
it had better be this way or else it's pathologic. 
That's right. So that was my idea of teaching

15:18.873 --> 15:22.878
histology. I wouldn't give you a dime for a pure 
little course in histology. And I've told them

15:28.104 --> 15:31.889
that over in biology. And they don't like me. They 
don't like you because you don't like them. The old

15:38.281 --> 15:49.471
boy we had here teaching pathology when I was in 
anatomy, he didn't like it because I was carrying

15:38.281 --> 15:49.471
them off into pathology and comparing the normal 
and the abnormal. To me, that's the way I wanted to

15:49.952 --> 15:52.774
be taught. And that's the way I taught. I taught it 
as I wanted to be taught, but was not. That's the

16:03.645 --> 16:05.166
only way you're going to get it. When you have 
somebody who's dedicated enough and is educated

16:06.074 --> 16:21.120
enough in that field, and he should be, if he's 
going to teach it, he should spend every waking

16:06.074 --> 16:21.120
hour improving himself in his field. You're in 
history, and unless you stay with it and you burn

16:21.140 --> 16:30.816
your midnight oil and keep up with it and delve into 
it, you won't amount to a pinch either. And unless

16:32.315 --> 16:39.785
you want to give it to your students, you're 
interested enough in them to want to give them

16:32.315 --> 16:39.785
everything that you can. You don't have time for 
research. You have to give them what is known at the

16:44.852 --> 16:51.340
present time.

16:51.360 --> 16:54.184
And I mean, it had better be. I don't have any 
meetings. In anatomy, American Association of

16:56.648 --> 17:03.034
American Veterinary Anatomists. And the last one 
I attended, here's an old boy from Colorado. He

17:08.159 --> 17:09.581
loves to draw. So in histology, what do they do? 
They draw pictures they're looking at in the

17:14.285 --> 17:20.131
microscope. Beautiful pictures of whatever 
organ it happens to be. I said, well, when I was down

17:26.264 --> 17:35.196
in Galveston in 1950, they required me to take 
their freshman course in histology, which was, to

17:26.264 --> 17:35.196
me, a laugh. Because I'd taught this stuff for 30 
years. And I'd had all the pathology. And they

17:41.845 --> 17:45.590
weren't telling me anything about histology. But 
we had to draw. Because Dr. Pomerant was the

17:48.634 --> 17:53.601
instructor in histology. And he is an artist. in 
his own right, as well as an architect. He was an

18:00.186 --> 18:01.628
architect. He was an artist. He had his PhD in 
science and tissue culture work. Dr. Pomerant,

18:08.274 --> 18:09.915
he's dead now. But he wanted us to make drawings. 
And I said, I don't know how many hours I've spent

18:14.860 --> 18:19.404
just stippling. I said, what do you learn when you 
stipple? What do you learn when you spend all this

18:24.297 --> 18:27.783
time drawing? I said, now, if that's all I have to 
teach in histology, I am not teaching. I want to

18:35.776 --> 18:47.436
keep that student so busy looking at tissues he 
doesn't have time to draw, and I'm teaching him to

18:35.776 --> 18:47.436
recognize the normal. And I'm comparing it with 
all kinds of abnormalities that I can find in that

18:48.935 --> 18:54.863
organ. He's seen the whole work. My kid said, Dr. 
John, I learned more pathology in your class than I

18:57.286 --> 19:03.895
did when I went to pathology. I said, but you knew 
the normal. Absolutely. You know what's normal.

19:10.924 --> 19:11.885
So that's the way. But you don't have time for a lot 
of research.

19:19.445 --> 19:23.191
Well, I'm glad that we can end this interview on 
such a strong note.

19:26.236 --> 19:29.322
Well, I'll feel like that to my dying day.

19:32.207 --> 19:40.761
Unless an instructor is heart and soul in it, and he 
has the student, in the proper perspective this

19:42.817 --> 20:09.955
youngster has to get everything that i can put 
between his ears everything i'm not going to

19:42.817 --> 20:09.955
slight him in any way unless he has that attitude he 
better not be in teaching we have too damn many

19:42.817 --> 20:09.955
graduate students now who are working in there and 
all they want their degree and get gone and you have

20:11.251 --> 20:37.309
more complaints about students they have a 
graduate assistant teaching a major course they

20:11.251 --> 20:37.309
may be a foreigner and they can't understand him 
half he says that anyhow we've had those

20:11.251 --> 20:37.309
complaints well thank you very much This ends the 
interview with Dr. John Miller. Well, Terry, I

20:40.976 --> 20:44.930
don't know where you are. Appreciate it.
