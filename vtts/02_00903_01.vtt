WEBVTT

00:03.001 --> 00:06.286
Um, it's March the 14th, 1984. My name is Bree Dodd, 
and I'm in the office of Walter Johnson. Jackson.

00:11.893 --> 00:12.414
Jackson. Always do that. And we're here to discuss 
the history of planning in Galveston. The current

00:20.165 --> 00:21.787
history of planning in Galveston. Well, current 
history. I don't know very little. I'm not sure

00:23.669 --> 00:28.816
Galveston did a very good job of planning in some 
cases, especially in the last 20 years. But, uh,

00:29.017 --> 00:30.679
uh, Gal, I just can't speak to the historical 
development of planning. I do know that from in the

00:37.330 --> 00:49.917
earlier, the formation years of Galveston, there 
certainly had to be a lot of planning, had to be a lot

00:37.330 --> 00:49.917
of studies and ways to create and make a city on a 
barrier island functional and they were

00:50.487 --> 01:10.487
successful for quite a while and especially 
following such things as the 1900 storm where

00:50.487 --> 01:10.487
6,000 lives were lost and the whole city had to be 
the grade level raised and the the development of

01:12.323 --> 01:20.271
city government, which came about in Galveston, 
as we know, or the manager council form of

01:12.323 --> 01:20.271
government. Today, Galveston seems to be doing a 
fairly good job of trying to study some of its

01:22.213 --> 01:37.488
needs, but it still appears that most of it is 
reaction to things that are happening instead of

01:22.213 --> 01:37.488
long-range planning or, you know, not... I think 
our problem is, lately, we may have... failed to

01:41.770 --> 01:49.843
plan instead of planning to fail, but we failed 
anyway, especially in the 60s and 70s. But it's

01:49.983 --> 02:00.420
coming back now where folks are really taking a 
look at long-range plans as well as short-range

01:49.983 --> 02:00.420
plans.

02:03.204 --> 02:06.389
We have problems of water down here. Where are we 
going to get our water supply? That's been served

02:08.467 --> 02:12.639
well with contracts. Bind water from Houston for 
the next 30 years. lousy job of planning how we're

02:18.119 --> 02:32.095
going to keep our streets and sewers and upgrade 
our city services in conjunction with the tax

02:18.119 --> 02:32.095
limitations that have been imposed by the voters 
of Galveston. And we're really facing a strong

02:32.796 --> 02:37.761
dilemma, a big dilemma in that area right now. And I 
don't know what's going to happen, but we better

02:37.802 --> 02:43.348
get some good planners that can figure out 
something to do and sell it to the people.

02:46.792 --> 02:47.873
I think planning is planning certainly has to be 
addressed in the future, and they're looking at it

02:48.359 --> 03:13.825
to some extent now, but as it has to do with being on a 
barrier island and the shift of the vegetation

02:48.359 --> 03:13.825
lines, development up and down the seawall, or all 
development on this island, and

02:48.359 --> 03:13.825
what problems we do face. And that probably has not 
been adequately done either, but You know, it's

03:18.565 --> 03:22.890
some of that's going to have to be done and will in 
the future. Let's look at your list here. See what

03:24.832 --> 03:25.573
else we do. I don't know. There is a comprehensive 
plan. They have a lot of that systematic stuff.

03:29.937 --> 03:31.819
They'll have to tell you at City Hall about that. 
Transportation is a tremendous problem here. We

03:35.383 --> 03:41.610
sure need to plan better for evacuation from 
hurricanes and storms. We only have one real good

03:43.169 --> 03:54.400
exit off this island, which is the Galveston 
Causeway and Interstate 45 and Hurricane Allen

03:43.169 --> 03:54.400
showed us what a mess that is when you're trying to 
evacuate. So that's certainly a problem.

04:00.547 --> 04:06.233
How the influences affect affected planning in 
our community? Well, I think probably all these

04:06.273 --> 04:12.619
categories have had some effect politically.

04:13.679 --> 04:26.918
Galveston is a very political town and things seem 
to wind up in issues and fighting things out on the

04:13.679 --> 04:26.918
ballot instead of doing a good job of studying the 
problems and working them out. Our geographic

04:29.542 --> 04:34.489
location, as we've talked about, certainly has a 
big role in that. I really don't think religious or

04:34.529 --> 04:42.100
ethnic have affected us too much except to the fact 
that We have probably had a lack of planning and

04:43.295 --> 04:52.067
good management in the city because we lack a 
strong middle class in this community. We have a

04:52.728 --> 05:09.070
majority of lower income people and quite a few 
higher income people, but most of the middle class

04:52.728 --> 05:09.070
people tend to migrate towards the mainland, 
Dickinson, Clear Lake area. Even though they work

05:09.130 --> 05:11.293
here, they drive home at night. across the 
causeway and really have not gotten into the

05:11.881 --> 05:32.612
political arena and pressed for some of the 
changes that I think fast growing suburban areas

05:11.881 --> 05:32.612
tend to do because it's

05:11.881 --> 05:32.612
probably geographic and it's sociological and 
it's probably educational. We tend to have a high

05:34.555 --> 05:37.720
college professor tight mentality coming from 
the medical branch, which would tend to be more

05:38.189 --> 05:47.550
environmentalist and tend to lean to one 
direction. And we have a strong blue collar

05:47.630 --> 05:53.143
background here, but just which they tend to 
accept things as they are and don't tend to really

05:53.967 --> 06:00.400
care about changing too much or studying it. We 
have studied problems. As long as the federal

06:02.805 --> 06:14.929
government gives us money to study problems, 
we'll find 10 or 15 people that want to go out and get

06:02.805 --> 06:14.929
some of that money to study it, but those studies 
tend to wind up on the shelf somewhere and never

06:02.805 --> 06:14.929
really get implemented. some of the things that I 
think we really need to be planning for in the

06:15.280 --> 06:38.892
future as far as long range and the development of 
Galveston certainly is transportation as we were

06:15.280 --> 06:38.892
talking about not only access into the island but 
once people get here how are we going to move them we

06:15.280 --> 06:38.892
are finally in an upward mobility type situation 
as far as population and we're gonna we've got new

06:39.378 --> 06:51.732
people moving here, as well as a tremendous 
increase in tourist and visitor traffic, and

06:39.378 --> 06:51.732
that's going to require some tremendous planning 
in how to handle this in future years. As I

06:51.852 --> 06:56.597
mentioned, the water problem seems to be planned 
pretty well. City utilities, city services

06:57.518 --> 07:08.811
certainly is a weak area, and you've got to plan for 
the dollars as well as plan where you're going to

06:57.518 --> 07:08.811
put things and how you're going to do it. That seems 
to be a weak area we need to get into. We've touched

07:13.639 --> 07:17.908
on the economic through all of this. Military,

07:17.948 --> 07:22.176
we're not significantly impact by the military. 
However, we are significantly impact by

07:24.521 --> 07:39.499
governmental agencies and governmental 
services, which have created a lower tax base

07:24.521 --> 07:39.499
because we have so much tax exempt property that 
are do not go into the do not generate taxes. And

07:39.619 --> 07:45.627
it's it's it's put us in a money crunch from that 
angle as well as the tax limitations.

07:48.891 --> 07:50.813
I promise you all these things in here have can be 
addressed for galveston though starting with the

07:51.653 --> 08:21.340
spanish era all the way up it'd be interesting to 
see what you come up with because especially from

07:51.653 --> 08:21.340
the civil war the republic of texas own and even the 
mexican era but all of those really it would be fun

07:51.653 --> 08:21.340
to go back and see how it how it affects i just don't 
know but uh... uh... i imagine a lot of the things

07:51.653 --> 08:21.340
that started in in planning of cities especially 
in the state of texas probably started right here

07:51.653 --> 08:21.340
in galveston if you can go find where to get it out, 
because nearly everything that happened started

08:21.573 --> 08:25.338
in Galveston. So if you can get some good research 
material or get hold of somebody that knows, I'll

08:25.959 --> 08:34.411
tell you a good interview would be Bob Nesbitt. 
He's a historian here. Do you know Bob? No. Robert

08:37.435 --> 08:38.616
Nesbitt? Let me write his name down, because Bob 
probably could tell you all of this. He worked with

08:41.601 --> 08:42.442
Ray Miller. Do you know who Ray Miller is? I don't 
know. The Eyes of Texas and does, you know, all of

08:44.284 --> 08:46.868
that. But he... He would be a tremendous, and he's a 
nice fella, and he would take the time to really sit

08:49.923 --> 09:03.302
down and give you a good chronological 
development and everything, and he would know it

08:49.923 --> 09:03.302
and have support material for it too. Oh, well, 
fantastic. Let me see if I can get his phone number

09:04.563 --> 09:06.466
for you. Oh, that would be even better.

09:17.108 --> 09:18.130
I know the problems. I just don't know what's 
always being done. We do things like planning for,

09:20.054 --> 09:30.293
you know, working with the school, working with 
the city on immediate things like bond issues and

09:20.054 --> 09:30.293
streets and roads and the water problems. But the 
overall part, which I think really will tie into

09:30.333 --> 09:39.049
this later, and you'll see why we have such a 
problem now, somebody like Bob could really do you

09:30.333 --> 09:39.049
a good job. Why don't we take this from a different 
angle, how the planning has affected the

09:41.746 --> 09:50.777
businesses in Galveston? Well, the lack of 
planning probably has had a tremendous effect on

09:50.797 --> 10:02.951
them simply from

09:50.797 --> 10:02.951
what to do with downtown, you know. Downtowns have 
had trouble before and they've got central

10:04.433 --> 10:11.601
business districts all over tend to be having 
troubles and The lack of doing good planning and

10:12.003 --> 10:21.994
finding out the pitfalls and having a few 
failures, such as our Central Mall area and

10:12.003 --> 10:21.994
everything, it has had some effect on us. On the 
other hand, you can say that planning from the

10:23.335 --> 10:37.011
development of historical restoration and from 
those ends are having tremendous gains for us and

10:23.335 --> 10:37.011
probably are going to be the lifeblood of the 
redevelopment of the Central Business District.

10:37.331 --> 10:41.115
The ability to come out with some ordinances and 
some

10:41.551 --> 10:52.126
whatever from city hall that allows for zoning. It 
allows for the development or the restoration of

10:52.266 --> 11:08.128
the historical areas, the strand area, and pretty 
much the city as a whole since we have so much

10:52.266 --> 11:08.128
historical significance. One other question, 
Dallas. I

11:12.517 --> 11:23.673
think we've touched on most of it. I think so, too. 
Like I say, I'm just not familiar enough to really

11:25.295 --> 11:31.144
get into the nuts and bolts of it. But boy, Bob, Bob. 
And tell him who you are, because he'd love to help

11:34.117 --> 11:37.041
you. He is a super nice guy, and he would be a super 
source. And what he doesn't know, he certainly

11:44.172 --> 11:46.556
would know where to refer you. I know to refer you to 
City Hall or people like that, or people that may

11:46.576 --> 11:55.770
give you an opinion one way or the other, but really 
good factual information. other than Rosenberg

11:55.818 --> 11:59.967
Library or somebody like Bob that knows the city. 
Well, I think you've given me some very good

12:00.148 --> 12:02.813
information. Well, hopefully it'll help you 
some. Oh, yes, I'm sure it will. Thank you very

12:06.301 --> 12:06.702
much. Thank you. You driving back and forth, or 
y'all?

12:31.272 --> 12:38.762
My

12:31.272 --> 12:38.762
name is Bree Dodd, and I'm in the office of Roger 
Hedrick.

12:41.386 --> 12:45.491
And it's March the 17th, 16th, 1984.

12:48.715 --> 12:52.360
Okay, and we're here to discuss the history of 
planning in Galveston.

12:55.084 --> 12:56.266
Okay, question one. When was the first 
legislative authorization of a comprehensive

12:56.326 --> 13:00.992
plan in Galveston?

13:03.368 --> 13:11.519
As far as I know, the first authorization came 
about when the current city charter was adopted in

13:03.368 --> 13:11.519
1961.

13:14.904 --> 13:22.475
A major part of that city charter revolved around 
the new form of government. You may recall that

13:23.836 --> 13:32.228
back in 1900, after the 1900 hurricane or major 
storm, the city of Galveston invented a new form of

13:32.360 --> 13:37.045
government called the commission form of 
government. That form of government was in effect

13:38.707 --> 13:49.979
until 1961, when by a vote of the people, the city 
charter was adopted and the city manager form of

13:38.707 --> 13:49.979
government was instituted. That was also the time 
where there was something in the city charter

13:52.042 --> 14:00.010
called Article 10, which dealt specifically with 
planning. That's when A planning commission was

14:03.443 --> 14:07.188
formed prior to that time. As I understand it, it 
was primarily a zoning commission. The powers and

14:13.276 --> 14:30.379
duties of the planning commission were set out, 
including recommendations to city council, the

14:13.276 --> 14:30.379
annual submission of a capital improvements 
budget, the final authority for disapproval and

14:13.276 --> 14:30.379
approval of subdivision flats, and, of course, 
the authority to prepare a master plan or a

14:31.034 --> 14:35.280
comprehensive plan. Another feature of this 
charter, as long as I'm on it, was that it set forth

14:37.504 --> 14:45.516
the creation of a position called the director of 
planning. So this is called for in the charter

14:47.018 --> 15:00.518
itself that the director is appointed by the city 
manager, and he's got to have certain, well, let me

14:47.018 --> 15:00.518
quote, who shall be qualified by special training 
and experience in the field of city planning. And

15:02.759 --> 15:11.947
then it goes into what are some of the components of 
the master plan or comprehensive plan and what the

15:02.759 --> 15:11.947
legal effect of the master plan. So it was really 
first authorized, as far as I know, in 1961. As far

15:16.110 --> 15:32.344
as when a plan was approved,

15:16.110 --> 15:32.344
components components of a comprehensive plan 
were passed.

15:40.881 --> 15:56.520
Starting in 1963, a

15:40.881 --> 15:56.520
report on population land use thoroughfares and 
transportation was prepared by urban planning

15:40.881 --> 15:56.520
and area development consultants. That was June 
of 63. Also in 63, a public utilities plan was

15:59.746 --> 16:05.611
prepared by Forrest and Cotton.

16:08.314 --> 16:20.824
In July of 65, the Galveston Central Business 
District plan was reported, pardon me, report was

16:08.314 --> 16:20.824
prepared by Marvin Springer and Associates.

16:24.668 --> 16:28.251
Also in 1965, a housing community facilities plan 
report was prepared by Marvin Springer. In 65,

16:31.754 --> 16:42.027
also, people and land use thoroughfares business 
district beachfront housing and community

16:31.754 --> 16:42.027
facilities plan was again done by Marvin Springer 
and Associates.

16:45.812 --> 16:57.968
Then we jump to some period in time when the plan, I 
guess you would say, was largely modified or a new

16:45.812 --> 16:57.968
plan appeared in 1973 by Marvin Springer and 
Associates to be adopted by council then the

16:58.268 --> 17:06.118
following year in 74. Now I would like to point out 
that because the city of Galveston only basically

17:06.138 --> 17:22.439
went to the end of the seawall, the western part of 
Galveston was not included in that plan. So to this

17:23.961 --> 17:27.786
day we don't really have a comprehensive plan in 
existence for the west end of Galveston Island.

17:32.093 --> 17:41.124
Also, at least to how I define a plan, many things 
were missing besides simply the rest of the

17:32.093 --> 17:41.124
island. There weren't really a lot of clear-cut 
goals and objectives and policies. A year later,

17:48.753 --> 17:54.060
let's see if it was a year later,

18:03.322 --> 18:25.102
pardon me, it was even in 1976, which might have 
been a year or two later, that an independent,

18:03.322 --> 18:25.102
really non-official city-sponsored group got 
together and did a goals for Galveston plan, which

18:03.322 --> 18:25.102
really kind of, I guess, complemented the 
comprehensive plan, although normally goals

18:03.322 --> 18:25.102
come before a comprehensive plan. So things were 
done a little bit differently then. And

18:33.933 --> 18:44.125
Since that time,

18:33.933 --> 18:44.125
well, we do not have any systematic periodic 
review of our city's comprehensive plan.

18:45.147 --> 18:52.696
However, the planning staff sees the island 
largely as two different areas. The older, more

18:53.998 --> 19:03.349
urbanized part of the island, which is that 10 
miles behind the seawall, and those remaining 20

18:53.998 --> 19:03.349
miles of the island which are largely 
resort-oriented or second homes, that there is a

19:03.734 --> 19:14.469
large amount of land available that can be planned 
for on the west end of the island. But as far as the

19:15.510 --> 19:21.057
east end, that is mainly it doesn't have growth, 
but it has redevelopment potential. And so our

19:21.999 --> 19:32.593
basic process to bring about land use planning to 
Galveston has kind of two concepts. The first one

19:33.147 --> 19:40.697
is we got started in going through the older part of 
Galveston on a neighborhood by neighborhood

19:33.147 --> 19:40.697
basis. And to date, we have two neighborhood plans 
which have been adopted by the Planning

19:41.999 --> 19:47.346
Commission and City Council. Which 
neighborhoods are those? That's the East End and

19:49.469 --> 19:53.375
Old Central. We have two neighborhood plans in 
process which are nearly completed. And those...

20:01.919 --> 20:05.544
Those are Carver Park and the Kempner Park 
neighborhoods. Beyond those four, there still

20:07.186 --> 20:19.582
are a good six to eight plans which no funding has 
been identified yet or a way of undertaking those

20:07.186 --> 20:19.582
plans. Although I would like to point out that in 
1982, the city council did officially recognize

20:27.316 --> 20:32.440
geographically about a dozen neighborhoods 
within the city. And we established a priority

20:32.801 --> 20:39.226
system for going through the older parts of the 
city and doing it on a neighborhood by

20:32.801 --> 20:39.226
neighborhood planning basis. But again, we have 
not identified funds at this time to continue that

20:39.907 --> 20:45.852
program beyond this year. We had funded those 
plans through community development block grant

20:47.253 --> 20:56.361
program, but those funds have been diminishing 
and council's priorities have been changing.

20:57.016 --> 21:12.496
Lastly, I would comment that we have a proposal 
which has gained acceptance by the Planning

20:57.016 --> 21:12.496
Commission and City Council to do a comprehensive 
plan this year for Galveston Island. I can give you

21:12.576 --> 21:14.238
a copy of that if you'd like that. Oh, fantastic.

21:18.324 --> 21:21.388
Can I bring it back for you right now so I don't 
forget about it? Catherine.

21:26.665 --> 21:28.747
Okay. Would you also bring another copy of one of 
these things, please? You want a copy of that?

21:33.171 --> 21:33.271
Yeah. They're back there with Catherine. Okay. 
This

21:37.515 --> 21:55.170
is a staff proposal, which basically proposes to 
do a comprehensive plan for the entire city of

21:37.515 --> 21:55.170
Galveston, which would be all of Galveston Island 
and all of Pelican Island. Galveston really is two

21:55.488 --> 21:57.131
islands. And there's basically two land holes in 
Galveston. It excludes an area called Pirates

22:01.898 --> 22:10.332
Beach, Pirates Cove, which is a separate 
municipal utilities district, which is

22:01.898 --> 22:10.332
unincorporated. It's a part of the county. And 
also Bermuda Beach, which is a separate city unto

22:12.175 --> 22:20.027
itself on West Galveston.

22:24.817 --> 22:25.878
Yeah, I think we've answered. Two, three, let's 
see, four.

22:37.034 --> 22:40.018
Yeah, I would say we do an awful lot of incremental 
planning. But again, with those two concepts of

22:42.121 --> 22:49.491
trying to do the old parts of town through 
neighborhood planning and This proposal that the

22:49.758 --> 22:57.806
staff has put together would basically rely on 
existing plans in the older part of town and try and

22:49.758 --> 22:57.806
weave them together. In the western part of 
Galveston, it really is very much different. It's

23:04.373 --> 23:18.887
very ecologically sensitive, so we

23:04.373 --> 23:18.887
anticipate using what we call coastal zone 
management principles, which are more

23:04.373 --> 23:18.887
applicable to barrier islands in that particular 
part of town. Boy, when was the first one? Isn't

23:22.492 --> 23:29.299
that basically from Clark's book on coastal zone 
management and finding what tidal areas are, et

23:22.492 --> 23:29.299
cetera? I would say I have

23:29.319 --> 23:40.530
read Clark's book, and I would say that, I guess, 
has been kind of the Bible, so to speak. And

23:40.910 --> 23:51.220
although we have reviewed other barrier island 
plans and incorporated the ideas there, notably

23:40.910 --> 23:51.220
Sanibel Island off of Florida.

23:53.444 --> 24:04.180
Have they been very successful and that's why 
you're basing some of your principles on that

23:53.444 --> 24:04.180
plan?

24:04.540 --> 24:12.672
I don't know how successful the plan is, but the 
techniques of planning appear to be very

24:04.540 --> 24:12.672
successful and appear to be state of the art. And 
certainly because of the individuals involved in

24:13.374 --> 24:20.464
the preparation of that plan, I have a great deal of 
confidence in the methodology. That was Wallace

24:20.748 --> 24:30.060
McHarg, Robertson Todd out of Philadelphia. The 
Conservation Fund

24:30.601 --> 24:39.272
was involved in addition to, I think, a lot of local 
participation.

24:41.655 --> 24:43.017
When was the first zoning ordinance? I would have 
to talk to the city...

24:50.161 --> 24:52.164
Can I have one of the ladies call down? Sir. Okay. 
I'll call down myself.

25:00.315 --> 25:00.435
Oh. By the way, I'd like the Xerox to cover so I have 
the bibliographical information. Okay. This is

25:09.307 --> 25:10.128
Roger. Can you tell me when the first zoning 
ordinance was adopted by, I guess, a city council?

25:21.768 --> 25:24.671
1937 was the very first one. Very fine. Thank you. 
Bye-bye. 1937. So this is another city where

25:30.077 --> 25:36.725
zoning came before comprehensive planning. 
Well, yeah, and of course, you know, all that does

25:36.745 --> 25:48.518
is follow the federal state way of doing things, 
too, because, you know, the federal legislation,

25:36.745 --> 25:48.518
you know, And of course, in the state of Texas, 
while we have zoning enabling legislation, we do

25:49.207 --> 25:56.235
not have planning enabling legislation yet. 
Although, I've recently received a proposal from

25:57.036 --> 26:18.640
Richard Lilly,

25:57.036 --> 26:18.640
who is basically a head of legislative affairs for 
Texas chapter APA, and he's proposed a two-part

25:57.036 --> 26:18.640
program for drafting new legislation this year. 
The first part was to basically survey planning

26:19.312 --> 26:34.595
directors and executive board members on what the 
issues were that should be studied and

26:19.312 --> 26:34.595
recommendations then brought to the Texas 
Municipal League. And secondly, the drafting of

26:35.176 --> 26:39.041
enabling legislation on comprehensive 
planning. So I guess that's really a side issue,

26:39.923 --> 26:45.471
but it fits in.

26:49.062 --> 26:54.969
Okay, number seven is what procedures do we have 
for implementing community plans? Okay, let me

26:56.451 --> 27:04.842
see if I can remember my, the

26:56.451 --> 27:04.842
state legislation.

27:10.889 --> 27:13.973
Well, the tools available for all cities in Texas, 
The tools available for Galveston also to carry

27:15.826 --> 27:25.077
out the plan involve grants of authority from the 
state and consist of four powers. Regulatory,

27:26.439 --> 27:31.745
eminent domain, taxation, and the spending 
power.

27:35.570 --> 27:39.775
As far as planning and the planning department, 
we've only been involved in two of those powers.

27:39.895 --> 27:41.597
The first one, of course, is regulatory. We're 
involved on a regular basis through zoning and

27:41.864 --> 27:45.968
subdivision regulations. And then the spending 
power, we are involved through our capital

27:47.530 --> 27:51.273
improvements plan and program. So that is that. 
What CIP are you currently working on? Well,

28:00.042 --> 28:05.107
actually, I think our CIP has been rather 
successful as of late. Of course, I too say success

28:07.610 --> 28:10.993
of a plan is only if a plan is implemented. And in 
this case,

28:13.674 --> 28:32.109
council named something they called the 
Executive Bond Committee, which comprised of

28:13.674 --> 28:32.109
members largely of the Planning Commission, in 
addition to a bond expert and a member of the

28:13.674 --> 28:32.109
Chamber of Commerce, and put together a bond 
proposal. And city council is now on record of

28:32.830 --> 28:41.537
taking this to the voters on August of this year, 
August of 84.

28:42.074 --> 28:47.321
What is very unusual, I guess, about this is that 
the last time, there's two things, really.

28:48.322 --> 29:00.678
Galveston hasn't had a bond issue that I'm aware 
of, a general

28:48.322 --> 29:00.678
bond issue, since about 1964 was the last time. So 
it's been about 20 years or two decades. The other

29:04.543 --> 29:11.372
major issue involved, which is to why I think... 
this is a particularly unique planning program,

29:12.061 --> 29:38.524
is that there occurred a charter amendment

29:12.061 --> 29:38.524
which limited to increases in city budget to no 
more than 7% a year, which on the current

29:12.061 --> 29:38.524
situation, there is no way to pass a bond issue and 
then pay the bonds back through general revenue

29:12.061 --> 29:38.524
sources. So on this same August election date, 
they will also have to place on there, if they want

29:38.757 --> 29:59.825
to proceed in a timely fashion, an amendment to the 
charter to take the budget limitations of general

29:38.757 --> 29:59.825
obligation bonds from under this budget lid, 
which was placed there by the taxpayers. So this is

30:00.505 --> 30:04.731
a two-fold situation.

30:08.795 --> 30:11.758
When did the city first establish a planning 
department?

30:20.006 --> 30:21.187
Let me call the city secretary. She's been around 
for quite a while.

30:38.849 --> 30:40.131
Linda, this is Roger. I've got a tough question for 
you. When did the city establish the first

30:45.700 --> 30:49.466
planning department?

30:53.233 --> 30:53.814
You say why? You

30:53.834 --> 30:58.702
don't know? Okay, can you bounce that off of Patsy 
and see if she knows? Thank you.

31:17.290 --> 31:28.360
Concerning professional planners on the staff, 
we have two planners in addition to myself, the

31:17.290 --> 31:28.360
director, who are what I would consider 
professional planners. We're anticipating

31:28.380 --> 31:30.782
hiring one more planner. So it would be a staff of 
three planners and one director. We also have a

31:35.786 --> 31:45.475
compliance officer, zoning compliance officer, 
who is not trained in planning, but obviously he is

31:35.786 --> 31:45.475
enforcing the zoning codes.

31:49.690 --> 31:54.559
While we're waiting, I see that you have a 
background in landscape architecture. I think

31:55.500 --> 31:56.802
that's sort of interesting. Because I'm a 
landscape architect. Oh, is that right? Well,

31:59.507 --> 32:08.403
I'm highly biased, but I certainly think that's 
probably one of the better backgrounds for

31:59.507 --> 32:08.403
physical city planning. Well, I agree. And you'll 
note I don't have a degree in city planning. Public

32:13.031 --> 32:14.574
administration. Right, right. Which to me, 
planning kind of wedges itself in between public

32:15.728 --> 32:25.521
administration and landscape is a little more 
nitty gritty site planning type of stuff. And

32:25.561 --> 32:27.664
public administration tends to be even broader. 
Yes. And perhaps even more policy oriented.

32:30.888 --> 32:32.951
Certainly. Yeah, this is Roger. Can you tell me 
when the first planning department was formed?

32:49.394 --> 33:04.069
OK.

32:49.394 --> 33:04.069
OK.

32:49.394 --> 33:04.069
OK, prior to that date, then, the Planning 
Commission just did all the work. And they only did

33:04.990 --> 33:08.793
zoning up until that point. OK, but you must have 
had zoning cases then. And only, OK, and you didn't

33:12.657 --> 33:17.602
have a staff for that commission, in other words. 
Very good.

33:26.958 --> 33:29.221
OK. OK. There was a zoning commission until 1961. 
Then it became a?

33:37.110 --> 33:38.892
Oh. OK. Was it since 37 that there was a separate 
zoning and planning?

33:47.582 --> 33:47.723
37. OK. See,

33:47.743 --> 33:54.771
at one time, there were two separate commissions, 
which is not unusual. There's a zoning commission

33:56.236 --> 33:58.439
and a planning commission.

34:01.003 --> 34:05.009
And Patsy's trying to recall the city secretary 
exactly when all this came about. But there was not

34:05.890 --> 34:13.581
a planning staff per se until 1961 when the city 
charter was adopted. Was there a director at that

34:13.781 --> 34:15.383
time? Or did they just hire out consultants? She 
said planning department. Because I got the

34:23.084 --> 34:30.553
impression that Marvin Springer and Associates 
was a consultant. Well, yeah. But that would

34:31.714 --> 34:34.477
probably be likely. It's easy to rationalize that 
if they hired one guy, and he's it. Of course. OK.

34:41.345 --> 34:52.838
Let

34:41.345 --> 34:52.838
me just repeat this for someone else's benefit. 
August the 5th, 1937,

34:53.257 --> 34:58.606
zoning regulations were established.

35:10.667 --> 35:15.535
The zoning commission was established in a later 
year or two.

35:24.121 --> 35:27.984
Okay.

35:28.005 --> 35:32.929
Okay.

35:33.009 --> 35:34.330
Was there a separate planning commission? Oh,

35:34.370 --> 35:39.995
okay. Okay, so a separate planning commission was 
formed in 61. In 1973, they combined the planning

35:44.219 --> 35:51.466
and the zoning commission into one, and that's the 
way it's been ever since. Very good. Thanks for

35:53.433 --> 35:54.194
your help. That is interesting. I hope you send me a 
copy of what you're doing, because I'm not going to

35:56.316 --> 35:59.240
remember all this stuff. I can send you a 
transcript and then the final article. OK, that

36:05.367 --> 36:06.629
would be great.

36:11.534 --> 36:17.061
Number 10 is really easier to show you a picture 
than it is to describe it.

36:34.895 --> 36:36.197
Would you like a copy of this? Yes. That would be 
good. OK. Rather than describe it, can I just refer

36:39.320 --> 36:41.923
to it? Sure. OK. Question number 10 refers to the 
organizational structure and its relationship

36:43.685 --> 36:52.015
with the legislative body and citizens groups. 
Rather than try and totally describe it, I'll just

36:53.297 --> 36:58.723
say that we have a city manager form of government. 
The planning department supports four different

36:59.044 --> 37:04.530
boards, those boards being the City Planning 
Commission, the Zoning Board of Adjustment, the

37:04.966 --> 37:24.590
Historical District Board, and a new committee 
which was just formed called,

37:04.966 --> 37:24.590
if we haven't met yet, the Hazardous Materials 
Technical Advisory, or pardon me, Ad Hoc Advisory

37:04.966 --> 37:24.590
Committee. From time to time, City Council has 
also formed various committees which we have

37:25.572 --> 37:30.438
supported. There has been a Record Service Code 
Committee, because we also administer the record

37:34.058 --> 37:37.924
code for the city. There's a hazardous materials 
committee, which is different than the one I just

37:38.765 --> 37:47.278
named because we prepared a hazardous materials 
transportation and storage plan for the city. And

37:48.480 --> 37:55.171
also the executive bond committee is another 
committee which we have supported.

37:56.653 --> 37:57.554
That's pretty much it. OK, let me get this off of 
this. Oh, and the bibliographic. Oh, okay. You

38:05.431 --> 38:06.540
just want the front page? Yes.

38:41.812 --> 38:44.637
Oh, boy. Founding of a city. Was it planned? How did 
this event play a role in your city's planning

38:48.024 --> 38:50.929
history?

38:56.599 --> 39:01.569
Okay.

39:01.589 --> 39:05.035
I can't think of the guy's name right now, but when I 
get that book back... The town was laid out by a

39:05.993 --> 39:10.903
gentleman in a grid fashion. And so that 
definitely played a major role.

39:20.381 --> 39:21.724
Frontier functions.

39:37.972 --> 39:46.761
Well, Galveston Island was originally 
inhabited, as I understand it, during the cooler

39:37.972 --> 39:46.761
months, at least, by Indians. It was also provided

39:48.683 --> 39:55.010
a harbor. It's a natural deep harbor for pirates.

40:04.159 --> 40:06.882
Probably, the railroad did not have Well, it had an 
impact, but obviously the port facilities played

40:07.655 --> 40:15.644
a much larger role as far as transportation goes. 
There was an air base here that goes back to World

40:17.427 --> 40:24.595
War II.

40:28.199 --> 40:30.422
I'm a little foggy on some of the history of all 
that. But you still see remnants of that when you go

40:31.364 --> 40:43.480
down to the hotel under construction and you see 
the bunker, which is the new hotel that's being

40:31.364 --> 40:43.480
built around. You go down and see the San Luis Pass, 
oh, somewhere on the 40-hundred block on Seawall

40:43.920 --> 40:50.869
Boulevard. That's a gun emplacement, you know, 
thick concrete kind of thing.

41:00.676 --> 41:05.561
Urban renewal was totally rejected by the 
citizens of Galveston. It's something they did

41:05.641 --> 41:07.002
not want.

41:13.288 --> 41:13.448
Luckily. Concerning the freeways, obviously, 
Galveston's connection to the mainland is pretty

41:13.468 --> 41:21.316
tenuous. We have one primary access point, and 
that's Interstate 45 across the causeway.

41:30.612 --> 41:42.329
a ferry boat, which can take you to Port Bolivar and 
on up to Beaumont and other places east on to

41:30.612 --> 41:42.329
Louisiana. And to the west, there is also a bridge 
which hooks up to the Freeport and the other chain

41:43.110 --> 41:52.283
of islands down to the south and west going on down. 
And of course, there is the airport. And, of

41:55.942 --> 41:59.426
course, there is the Houston Ship Channel. So 
those are pretty much the modes of

42:00.287 --> 42:07.375
transportation, although we are connected by a 
separate railroad bridge also. Of course, there

42:08.437 --> 42:22.313
is no passenger service at this time, but there has 
been continual discussion, at least since I've

42:08.437 --> 42:22.313
been here, I've been here for four years now, about 
re-establishing some type of passenger service

42:08.437 --> 42:22.313
to the mainland. The old railroad station has been 
part of it has been converted to a railroad museum.

42:29.345 --> 42:33.530
And so that might be the obvious point to depart 
from again.

42:37.335 --> 42:39.358
Significant public development projects. Oh, 
yes. There was one that is much larger than all the

42:42.402 --> 42:54.298
rest combined, and that is the seawall itself, 
which was the result of the 1900 storm in which

42:42.402 --> 42:54.298
6,000 people were killed. Work started one or two 
years after that traumatic event, and today we

42:55.207 --> 43:23.323
have a seawall which is some 17 feet in height, made 
of concrete,

42:55.207 --> 43:23.323
with rubble at the base these days because of 
erosion, and a four to six lane road on top with

42:55.207 --> 43:23.323
sidewalks called Seawall Boulevard. I think I 
mentioned it's 10 miles in length. So that was the

43:27.154 --> 43:30.579
major public works project.

43:33.484 --> 43:39.633
I think we've talked about the city's chartering 
changes, and it had a great deal of impact on

43:33.484 --> 43:39.633
planning.

43:42.998 --> 43:49.227
They can fire me, and they can reduce my salary, but 
they can't eliminate the position unless there's

43:42.998 --> 43:49.227
a vote of the people.

43:52.210 --> 44:03.300
Consultants definitely have played a role in city 
planning here, as

43:52.210 --> 44:03.300
they often do. I

44:03.320 --> 44:21.255
think in the early years, because of a lack of 
expertise back in the 60s, city planning was

44:03.320 --> 44:21.255
really just starting to come of age

44:03.320 --> 44:21.255
with the help of 701 planning funds. And cities 
just didn't have the expertise on board. So I think

44:26.135 --> 44:29.699
most of the comprehensive planning direction 
came from consultants. I think that's different

44:30.760 --> 44:44.014
from today, where you can see it's the staff which 
has prepared the comprehensive plan proposal,

44:30.760 --> 44:44.014
although we do not have the staff on board in 
sufficient quantity to carry it out, as is

44:30.760 --> 44:44.014
indicated there. And so we propose basically a 
one-third, two-thirds mix as far as man hours

44:44.034 --> 44:51.883
involved. but where the staff would give guidance 
to the plan and obviously the planning commission

44:52.403 --> 45:00.714
would oversee it and the council would approve a 
plan eventually.

45:03.758 --> 45:06.542
The current status of planning in the city remains 
political. You know, it's up and down. Although I

45:09.586 --> 45:21.162
think it continues to gain support when you can see 
that planners are here to stay and I think

45:09.586 --> 45:21.162
people... and that they have everyone's interest 
in mind. And when you have a staff that manages to

45:24.116 --> 45:32.685
stay for a few years and become more a part of the 
community.

45:36.589 --> 45:40.033
How have the following influences affected 
planning in your community?

45:44.658 --> 45:46.120
Here's this.

45:55.685 --> 45:56.486
OK. There

45:56.506 --> 46:19.771
have been strong political influence in this 
community, largely, I think, going back to the

45:56.506 --> 46:19.771
turn of the century and when Galveston was kind of 
what was known at that time as the Wall Street of the

45:56.506 --> 46:19.771
Southwest, an extremely wealthy town. And since 
that time, Two, three, or four, maybe slightly

46:24.575 --> 46:30.265
more.
