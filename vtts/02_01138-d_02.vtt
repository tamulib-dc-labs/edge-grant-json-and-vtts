00:11.607 --> 00:13.612
This is such a beautiful morning. I can't thank my 
maker for sparing me this day. You know, as we grow

00:20.209 --> 00:24.199
older, Don't take time, or probably, I wouldn't 
say as we grow older, I say as we're younger people,

00:24.483 --> 00:39.905
we don't take time to say how great it is to wake up in 
the morning and see the sunrise. We take it for

00:40.425 --> 00:41.787
granted. But in reality, the man above has the time 
clock. And to some of us, that clock is soon to run

00:48.497 --> 00:53.764
out. But I want the world to know that I enjoy my life 
and all of my friends. As I set out this morning on my

01:01.415 --> 01:15.150
little porch, my home, it was the greatest 
experience that I have ever witnessed, or one of

01:01.415 --> 01:15.150
the greatest, I will say that. I had always been 
under the impression that a chaparral or a road

01:24.541 --> 01:32.231
runner or a persona, whatever you want to call it, 
made its nest on the ground. But to my great

01:33.934 --> 01:38.720
surprise, it doesn't. And I sat there and I watched 
that mother bring her two babies down the tree and

01:38.740 --> 01:52.759
across the highway and over on vacant lot it was the 
greatest thing that I can tell you that ever was she

01:53.735 --> 02:21.480
got to the edge of the tree she raised her tail three 
times and whatever noise you want to say she made

01:53.735 --> 02:21.480
whether it was with her bill or with her voice box as 
you know the persona call as well as I she made that

01:53.735 --> 02:21.480
call a couple of times. Now just twice, not three 
times. But she raised the tail three times. Those

02:30.071 --> 02:33.797
little birds came tripping down that tree. How? 
I'm sure they helped with their claws. And she

02:40.867 --> 02:45.754
stood at the root of the tree until they were down. 
She took them out on the flat and Sure, there was

02:50.570 --> 02:55.838
grasshoppers, there was bugs, and they were fed. 
When she got to the highway, she walked to the edge

02:57.260 --> 03:01.906
of it. She raised that tail again three times. She 
gave a couple of calls, whether it was with her

03:06.673 --> 03:14.945
bill, I don't know, or how, but you know the persona 
call. And these little toots came up to the side of

03:15.706 --> 03:19.311
the road And they ran. They didn't just trip, but 
they ran across that road. And she hopped across on

03:27.601 --> 03:30.565
the other side. She got up on the top. She went right 
up the cut in this Dobie flat, which was at least

03:35.970 --> 03:45.460
three and a half to four feet high. She stood up 
there. She raised that tail three times. She gave

03:51.772 --> 03:53.274
that call. She looked from one side to the other. 
She looked to the east, to the west, to the north.

03:59.261 --> 04:01.625
And she gave the call a second time. And let me tell 
you, those little birds came up that high

04:02.786 --> 04:12.839
embankment and right to her feet. To me, where 
else? can a person but the hill country sit and

04:19.197 --> 04:26.026
watch anything any more lovely than that. Yes, she 
was training her babies to look to the right, to the

04:26.787 --> 04:40.465
left, and then make your move. She popped that bill 
a couple of times, and every one of them came to her

04:48.914 --> 04:52.979
It's just like they were standing at attention. 
And she came down the trail to where she had been fed

04:52.999 --> 05:00.347
before. And we had pitched out some bread. She took 
it in her beak. The babies didn't come. Now, they

05:09.317 --> 05:11.019
didn't come down that trail. She took it in her beak 
and took it back over and fed them. Well, at the end

05:16.893 --> 05:21.659
of the third day, the babies came. And she brought 
them with the same precaution across the highway

05:21.679 --> 05:31.871
and took them back.

05:34.915 --> 05:40.902
The training of even a bird begins in infancy. You 
forget, mothers and fathers, I know from actual

05:46.981 --> 06:02.842
experience that a mother's touch and a mother's 
love and a mother's intuition means more than any

05:46.981 --> 06:02.842
babysitter could ever mean. No one can look back on 
life and remember it like they can at as they can,

06:17.913 --> 06:29.323
kneeling at the side of their mother in prayer at 
evening, or hearing her lullabies to put them to

06:17.913 --> 06:29.323
sleep at night. I know that I am one of the most 
fortunate people in the world. Yes, one of the

06:36.750 --> 06:45.338
poorest, but one of the richest when it comes to 
God's own handiwork. My mother had the most

06:46.938 --> 06:53.267
beautiful soprano voice, my father a beautiful 
tenor voice. They had time to sing to us when we

06:54.629 --> 06:58.755
wanted to hear it. They had time to tell us stories 
at night. They had time to tuck us in because we had

07:03.722 --> 07:11.373
more time than we had money. We had more time to 
spend at home than we had to go somewhere because we

07:17.212 --> 07:25.580
didn't have the money to put the gas in old Betsy to 
go. Those were days that was molding of a

07:25.620 --> 07:31.786
character. I had a friend here today that is 
several years older than I, but one that knows the

07:32.707 --> 07:46.020
history of the hill country. backwards, 
forwards, upside down, and crossways. I had

07:52.164 --> 07:55.949
forgotten a lot of the things that he reminded me 
of. I well remember riding in races when I wasn't

07:57.431 --> 08:03.058
over 12 years old. Race race, horse races. And it 
didn't excite me. I enjoyed it. Could you see? Can

08:13.979 --> 08:17.642
you think of a girl today getting out and doing 
things like that? Well, that was the thing that we

08:19.764 --> 08:27.232
did for entertainment. Rope, ride, tell stories, 
kick the can, see who was the fastest to do this or

08:28.953 --> 08:41.365
who could jump the furthest, who could high jump 
the highest and all of that. That was all we had to

08:41.885 --> 08:43.547
do. was our own skills. But that makes life worth 
living and look back on today. Those people who

08:53.403 --> 08:57.547
competed with us, I look back today. They're 
doctors,

08:59.149 --> 09:06.216
nurses, schoolteachers. In other words, they are 
the salt of the earth. and they were brought up in

09:14.257 --> 09:17.182
the hill country. I want the world to know that 
there's not a smarter man that ever walked out of

09:18.544 --> 09:29.923
the Johnson City High School. Now that was just a 
little too before school but we put out mighty good

09:29.943 --> 09:38.577
people and Emmett Redford Dr. Emmett Redford, I 
should say, is one of the best educated. All right,

09:46.478 --> 09:54.045
we'll have Dr.

09:46.478 --> 09:54.045
Revity Glidden. Let me tell you, these people were 
the salt of the earth, and they worked, and they

09:54.066 --> 10:08.040
worked hard to get what they had because they 
didn't have the money handed down to them. And they

10:08.510 --> 10:11.235
really put out to get what they had.

10:14.220 --> 10:21.692
Not only did we produce presidents, but we have 
produced just as many good lay people. And they all

10:22.454 --> 10:26.961
have roots down in the hill country.

10:32.250 --> 10:33.893
No trabaje tanto. Today, the fifth day of 
September, 1981,

10:34.210 --> 10:59.543
Corky and I went down to the ranch to take an 
inventory of the cattle that we had and how old they

10:34.210 --> 10:59.543
were, which ones we should dispose of, which ones 
we should keep. Honestly, I know that people

11:00.316 --> 11:07.868
hearing this or reading it will not believe it. But 
it's true, folks. We have some cattle down there

11:10.632 --> 11:19.787
that are crossbreds, Angus and Bramers, that are 
20 years old. They are in the best shape. Fat? Yes.

11:26.017 --> 11:29.890
have the finest calves on them that we have ever 
produced. But I told Corky, I said, Corky, to me, it

11:30.512 --> 11:38.237
definitely is a risk To go through another winter 
with cattle this old it's time that we sold them,

11:39.263 --> 11:58.082
even though you don't get too much for them, they 
have served their time they've served their

11:39.263 --> 11:58.082
purpose and they like other folks or people are. 
beyond their productive years. However, I will

12:02.460 --> 12:04.747
say this. They have produced the best calf crop 
this year that I have ever seen. I don't know

12:10.484 --> 12:13.152
whether it is the breed, the cross, or whether it is 
the grassland on which they graze. I have often

12:22.726 --> 12:40.354
said, and I've heard my daddy say it, I've heard Sid 
Hyatt, and I've heard Harvey Croft, Armand Ware,

12:22.726 --> 12:40.354
and my Uncle Jay say any time that you can get a 
granite, gravel, piece of land the grass on it has

12:40.469 --> 12:50.021
more minerals and is stronger than any grass that 
can grow in the hill country. That I believe with

12:50.501 --> 13:00.934
all my heart because that's exactly what we have on 
our place and that's exactly why these cows are in

12:50.501 --> 13:00.934
such good shape. I have a little framer bull down 
there that I call Little Bull. I can stand on the car

13:07.463 --> 13:13.090
and blow the horn and say, come on, Little Bull. 
He's only a year old and he'll come running off of

13:13.631 --> 13:28.330
that hill just for me to love him and pet him and 
scratch his ears, scratch around his horn,

13:13.631 --> 13:28.330
scratch around his tail. I can touch him on his four 
legs and say, get down, brother. I can't reach up

13:33.666 --> 13:35.594
here. What does he do? He lays down. Now, I'm 
telling you, if you know anything about Bremer

13:40.460 --> 13:52.412
cattle, you know that they've got to know you and 
know you love them, or they're not going to do it.

13:53.073 --> 13:55.335
And listen, he is one of the best. And to me, that's 
what life is all about. Corky said, well, I've just

14:00.560 --> 14:03.283
got to sell these. I don't know what else to do. I 
said, give me time, Corky. I don't want this one to

14:07.267 --> 14:09.910
go to market. because he would mean a lot to 
somebody as a herd bull. Let me put him on the

14:14.856 --> 14:19.582
trading post as an advertisement. If nothing 
else, I'll take him to town and stake him in my front

14:20.143 --> 14:29.635
yard and show people what he can do, and I won't have 
any trouble selling him. So I sold him on the idea.

14:32.058 --> 14:33.079
So It won't be long until you'll see a Bremer bull 
out in my front yard. And I hope to be able to show the

14:40.151 --> 14:44.377
world what he can do. And I'm proud of him. Now 
that's just a small accomplishment. That's just a

14:49.926 --> 14:51.969
small thing in life. But to me, that's living. 
Letting the animals Know that you love them. And

15:02.603 --> 15:12.128
just like this morning, I was sitting out in the 
front reading my newspaper about 6.30, and I had

15:02.603 --> 15:12.128
the porch light on. Wasn't but a few minutes 
till... in jumps bunny bunks a squirrel in the tree

15:15.483 --> 15:43.414
and I've never heard such barking and scolding in 
my life and that was no other reason but I had the

15:15.483 --> 15:43.414
porch light on and sitting in the port in my chair on 
the porch reading the paper I said bunks if you'll

15:15.483 --> 15:43.414
come around the back door I'll feed you and hush 
that chattering well in a few minutes I could hear

15:43.917 --> 15:46.580
Bunny bunks going over the roof. Well, of course, I 
went to the back and fed it. I didn't want it eating

15:49.824 --> 15:53.829
out in the front because, sure enough, they do. 
They make a mess, and I wasn't anxious to sweep it up

15:53.929 --> 15:58.355
and clean it. But I'm proud to know that the 
squirrels even love me. And that's something

16:04.362 --> 16:05.964
else. I have a mockingbird that comes, and I feed 
it. I love to hear them sing. In fact, I don't know of

16:19.642 --> 16:31.816
anything that God has created in this world that 
there isn't some good in and put here for some

16:19.642 --> 16:31.816
purpose. Purpose we may not understand. We may not 
know. But God only made good things. He didn't make

16:39.524 --> 16:41.486
anything bad. The only thing that's made bad, we 
did it ourselves. And I love to see the sunrise come

16:48.194 --> 17:07.356
up in the east, and I love to watch it go down in the 
west, and hope that he will spare my life to see it

16:48.194 --> 17:07.356
come up in the morning. He would say, adios, mi 
amigos.

17:16.595 --> 17:30.469
Of all the great experiences that a child can have 
is living with nature and seeing it firsthand. If

17:31.748 --> 17:52.086
you've ever witnessed a mother raccoon teaching 
her babies how to fish that's one of the most

17:31.748 --> 17:52.086
interesting things in this world you'll 
understand exactly how mothers of today work and

17:31.748 --> 17:52.086
do the same with their children. Uncle Sid Hyde was 
one of the greatest naturalists that this country

17:54.530 --> 18:05.845
will ever know, yet he was just a regular fella. He 
said, now if you want to see how this is done,

18:06.746 --> 18:19.803
sister, sit down back here behind this rock just 
where you can be tall enough to look over and see

18:06.746 --> 18:19.803
what she did. The old mother raccoon went down to 
the river And she walked up and down the bank and she

18:25.006 --> 18:33.877
looked and she could see that there were some 
little perch in this shallow water. She came back

18:34.898 --> 18:43.949
and she chattered and chattered and chattered to 
these four baby raccoons. And she took them one at a

18:44.590 --> 18:50.277
time down to this shallow pool. And she got in. And 
she called to them, and one at a time got in this

18:53.997 --> 19:00.477
water, just one. And the other sat on the bank. And 
she would take them around and she'd paddle them

19:03.110 --> 19:07.496
around and she would talk to them. She'd take, when 
they got out, she just took it by her two front feet

19:07.996 --> 19:24.618
and just more or less shook the water off of him, set 
him down and just chattered as if to say, now you sit

19:07.996 --> 19:24.618
right here and don't you move till I tell you to. And 
sure enough, that little old fella sat there and

19:29.333 --> 19:34.839
waited until each one had had a chance at trying to 
catch the fish. Definitely, the second one she

19:35.640 --> 19:41.887
took in the water did catch its fish. Well, each one 
would go back in and she would repeat the same

19:42.748 --> 19:49.415
thing. When she got through fishing, or they'd all 
had their turn, she went to each one of them And she

19:57.734 --> 20:04.941
picked them up and shook them real good to see that 
the water was getting off of their fur. She set them

20:05.621 --> 20:07.103
back down. And she sat down just on her hunkers, 
more or less, and chattered and chattered, just as

20:07.643 --> 20:20.936
if to say, now, this is your first lesson, and this 
is how it's done. We're going to deeper water. So up

20:24.499 --> 20:27.522
the river they went about. 25 yards, and Uncle Sid 
saw her going up the path, and these little coons

20:28.852 --> 20:38.404
followed one right behind the other. She got up 
there in the same procedure. She didn't take the

20:42.008 --> 20:46.734
one she took the first time, but she took the one 
that went in last. She took him that time. And it's

20:49.558 --> 20:51.360
quite amusing. She took him and spent a lot more 
time in training him than she did in the beginning.

21:01.647 --> 21:08.557
For what reason, unless it was that he was quite 
smaller than the others or was weaker, I guess that

21:01.647 --> 21:08.557
was it. He was the weaker of the four. That happens 
in all families, even you know that as well as I,

21:12.563 --> 21:27.765
that the mother will favor the weaker child each 
time. It even comes out in our animal life. Anyway,

21:33.404 --> 21:36.668
she gave them all the things. But it was the cutest 
thing. It took two of them to catch this catfish. It

21:42.675 --> 21:45.518
wasn't much more than a foot long. But to them, it 
was a great big one. And it took both of them. And

21:50.484 --> 21:52.266
they put it out on that rock. And let me tell you. 
They all four ate, and there wasn't any fussing

21:55.555 --> 22:01.481
about, that's mine, you don't get any. They all 
four sat down around that catfish, and they'd just

22:01.501 --> 22:09.709
take a bite, it looked like, and then the next one 
take a bite around. And the old mother sat and

22:10.410 --> 22:18.738
watched just as faithful as a mother at a table 
would while his children ate. To me, that's the

22:18.758 --> 22:24.043
most wonderful lesson that a person could think 
of. Those things are, that's something that's

22:25.711 --> 22:30.675
never written up in books. People don't take the 
time they take for granted that everyone knows how

22:31.276 --> 22:35.760
it's done. And let me tell you, you've always heard 
that a possum plays dead, and he's called old pouty

22:38.062 --> 22:46.189
possum. But honestly, he isn't dead, but he's in a 
dead faint. He actually faints, and that's what

22:51.433 --> 22:54.756
really happens. And people have the wrong concept 
of it. And let me tell you, that's another thing

23:00.766 --> 23:04.149
that is really cute. Just watch an old mother 
possum. She'll take her tail and stretch it out.

23:11.256 --> 23:16.521
And one little possum will get with his head to the 
right and the other with his head to the left. And

23:16.761 --> 23:18.603
that's the way she'll do it. And that old tail goes 
over her back. And each little possum will. hook

23:23.643 --> 23:30.395
his claws in her fur and she'll carry him and she'll 
just go just a hopping. She doesn't run. She more or

23:31.758 --> 23:47.085
less hops down the trail to wherever she's going to 
take these babies and she'll chatter or grunt more

23:31.758 --> 23:47.085
or less and If either of the little fellas see 
something strange, they give this little call of

23:47.538 --> 23:55.407
caution. And she will stop and she'll look. She'll 
look to the right and she'll look to the left. And

24:01.935 --> 24:04.318
then she'll go on. And if something is wrong, 
she'll leave the trail and take to the bushes.

24:13.889 --> 24:14.710
And they're cute.

24:21.220 --> 24:34.312
You know, one day we were riding in the pasture, and 
I kept seeing this old buzzard that was just

24:21.220 --> 24:34.312
sitting on this dead tree, right on the tip top on a 
dead tree. And I said to my daddy, I said, Daddy, do

24:34.332 --> 24:41.758
you reckon it could be a dead cow over there in that 
thicket? I see a buzzard sitting over there. And he

24:43.860 --> 24:45.102
said, No, darling. He says, I don't think so. He 
said, If it's a dead animal, there would be

24:46.863 --> 24:51.227
several. buzzards all flying around together. 
But just this one, and I have an idea that there's a

24:55.151 --> 25:01.318
buzzard nest there. I said, a buzzard nest? He 
said, yes, you know, they lay eggs and they'll

25:03.440 --> 25:13.010
hatch them and one will stay and watch and the other 
one will go for food. And I said, Daddy, take me over

25:13.791 --> 25:16.834
there and let's see. And he said, now let me tell 
you. I'll take you over there, and if the old mama

25:19.658 --> 25:35.959
buzzard is on the nest, that will be the papa 
buzzard that's watching, and he'll have to go out

25:19.658 --> 25:35.959
and get feed for her, and he'll come back and feed 
her. But don't, now let me tell you, sister, I mean

25:37.160 --> 25:41.325
this. Don't ever go up to that nest and try to bother 
those little birds if they're there or pick them

25:41.345 --> 25:49.075
up. I said, well, why? Why can't I pick them up? I did 
know, and he told me when I was a child not to ever put

25:52.790 --> 25:59.898
my hand in a little bird's nest that their mama 
wouldn't come back. We left a scent that would

26:00.318 --> 26:05.464
frighten them, and they wouldn't come back, and 
the baby birds would starve. Well, I didn't figure

26:05.564 --> 26:12.893
that by picking up one of these little buzzards 
that that was bothering. He said, no, don't touch

26:12.933 --> 26:15.356
those buzzards. Leave them alone. If you do, 
you'll be sorry. And I said, well, why, Daddy, why?

26:21.596 --> 26:26.303
He said, well, that old papa buzzard, well, he 
didn't say vomit. He said, he'll just puke all over

26:26.323 --> 26:30.910
you and say, you just never will get that scent off 
of you. And I said, oh, Daddy, I wouldn't let that

26:31.531 --> 26:35.697
happen to me. I'd get out of his way. He said, well, 
you better not do it. Just mind what I tell you.

26:40.785 --> 26:41.626
Leave it alone. We looked at these two little 
buzzards, and they were... Little yellow downy

26:46.919 --> 26:54.881
things reminded me of little goslings, and oh, I 
thought they were the cutest things that ever was.

26:54.901 --> 26:59.814
Well, every two or three days, I'd have to go back 
and look at the buzzards, but I still didn't touch

26:54.901 --> 26:59.814
them. Well, they turned to be white. And, oh, I 
thought that was so pretty. And so Emmett Redford,

27:05.413 --> 27:20.206
Dr. Emmett Redford at the University of Texas in 
Linden and Kitty Clyde and Georgie Kamak and

27:05.413 --> 27:20.206
Irene, oh, just a whole gang of us after Sunday 
school was there. And I said, let's go down and look

27:20.226 --> 27:22.928
at the little buzzards. And they said, oh, little 
buzzards. I don't guess I ever saw one. Well, when

27:27.092 --> 27:31.155
we got down there this time, they had turned to 
another color. And they were kind of a... brown

27:32.296 --> 28:01.982
looking and just like a argancic turkey and color 
brown and I thought my goodness saliva but this is

27:32.296 --> 28:01.982
where they always were and I know it's the same 
buzzards and Margaret said well now the last time

27:32.296 --> 28:01.982
we was down here they were white they wasn't like 
this and I said no they've changed color so we went

27:32.296 --> 28:01.982
on back and we didn't bother them next time we went 
down there they were kind of uh Well. A green it was

28:04.469 --> 28:10.206
just nothing I couldn't say, but just a kind of a 
dark. Dirty. green look more or less like an olive

28:12.847 --> 28:42.499
green and I said well I've never seen anything like 
that now that just beats the world and we went on

28:12.847 --> 28:42.499
back and I told my daddy and he said oh yes they'll 
have it they'll change color again before they get

28:12.847 --> 28:42.499
black and I said daddy I just don't believe that 
that's the same buzzards I don't believe they're

28:12.847 --> 28:42.499
buzzards I think there's something else well it 
was quite a curiosity we went back down there in

28:12.847 --> 28:42.499
about another week and they were uh They turned to 
almost a black, but the most beautiful iridescent

28:42.850 --> 28:51.488
color that I ever looked at in my life. And I 
decided, and they were hopping around, just

28:51.568 --> 28:57.581
hopping and hopping all around, but not able to 
fly. And Margaret... said to me, said, Ava, why

29:00.772 --> 29:08.380
don't you go in there and get one of those, and let's 
just see if it is a buzzard. I said, well, how could

29:08.481 --> 29:14.287
we tell anymore if it's a buzzard just by looking at 
it out here? And she said, well, we can look at its

29:14.307 --> 29:17.350
feet. I said, well, you can see its feet anyway. She 
said, well, let's go in there and get one. So we

29:21.915 --> 29:30.525
started in there, and I'm telling you, that old 
papa buzzard really did, just like my daddy said,

29:21.915 --> 29:30.525
he sure did puke on us. stink and we vomited and we 
vomited. We were just sicker than a dog from the

29:34.903 --> 29:37.714
scent. And got home, and my mother wouldn't let us 
come in the house. And we went out and turned the

29:43.638 --> 29:50.725
water on out under the tank at the well to wash. But 
oh my God, trying to get it out of our hair. I'll

29:54.189 --> 29:56.251
never forget, and we both had long hair. And I'll 
tell you, we were the biggest mess that ever was.

30:01.056 --> 30:06.182
But I learned my lesson and learned it fast, not to 
bother little buzzards. Where

30:07.023 --> 30:12.732
are you? You are here. Where are you? You are there. 
Where are you? You are

30:27.715 --> 30:34.125
here. Where? Estamos

30:37.702 --> 30:42.347
nosotros. Nosotros estamos allá. ¿Dónde está yo? 
Yo está aquí. ¿Dónde están ellos? Ellos están

30:58.084 --> 31:01.548
allá.

31:04.951 --> 31:06.493
Hola, Catalina. Cortel. ¿Qué tal? Hola, 
Catalina. ¿Qué tal? Catalina. Muy bien. ¿Y tú?

31:17.259 --> 31:17.739
