00:00.031 --> 00:04.336
Not everybody, there's a half time.

00:07.520 --> 00:09.623
Is that good? I mean, does that help? Well, we have 
so many people coming in the summers that we can do

00:12.306 --> 00:21.797
all the dissertations in the summers. It's too 
much. But I think for eight to 12 months, I'm sure

00:30.170 --> 00:37.480
that our salaries are that much more than the 
average. Is the university not on the 12-month? Is

00:39.663 --> 00:41.125
it just the College of Education? Really? Well, 
that's my impression of it. There are other parts

00:43.909 --> 00:51.479
of the college teaching summer sessions, but I 
think they're appointed especially for that. It

00:53.041 --> 00:57.207
gives more time for research if you're not 
teaching. OK, for example, in your own situation,

01:00.865 --> 01:08.153
as a professor and trying to do research and the 
service, how do you balance your activity

01:00.865 --> 01:08.153
time-wise? Well, I don't have classes on Friday, 
and I've been trying to do recently. I was a

01:17.642 --> 01:20.425
weekend, night weekend, involved in kind of 
experimental research. My research is sort of

01:20.445 --> 01:25.150
philosophical. I'm good. I've

01:26.245 --> 01:43.039
been an old poet and school inspector working on 
biography, not only as a genre, but as a, which we

01:26.245 --> 01:43.039
are always sharing our biographies, just as we're 
doing right now. And so the intent of how we find out

01:43.829 --> 02:03.168
about others is a very important aspect of that 
because I was instrumental in establishing the

01:43.829 --> 02:03.168
society, the International Society

01:43.829 --> 02:03.168
of Earth. Educational biography? Yes. Those are 
the kinds of things that I do. Oh. For your own self,

02:06.812 --> 02:09.735
what do you feel like? has been Jack Campbell's 
contribution to the College of Education. Oh, you

02:15.282 --> 02:24.335
know, one gets discouraged

02:15.282 --> 02:24.335
because they wonder if they've ever done any good. 
We can't measure those things. Which is we also

02:24.976 --> 02:33.107
very often,

02:24.976 --> 02:33.107
I think, understand. They're not selling 
something. It's hard to say

02:36.059 --> 02:46.214
what the contribution is. I would like to think 
that it would change somebody's way of looking at

02:46.635 --> 02:53.625
teaching. I don't know whether that could be 
someday. Somebody will look back and say, I made a

02:54.547 --> 02:57.611
difference. But this is very difficult. I don't 
think we ever do as teachers. You touch the lives,

03:01.825 --> 03:09.596
and very rarely will you have the opportunity to 
have people come back and say, not very rarely you

03:01.825 --> 03:09.596
will have it. And I know that I have heard it from 
almost everybody that has had you in class. And

03:15.403 --> 03:21.111
your caring for students has always been 
something that comes out from people. And I think

03:21.292 --> 03:23.835
that means more than anything. You have shown all 
along that you cared for students. Yes, I think

03:27.720 --> 03:28.882
that. I do. I don't know if I... that comes out, but I 
do really care for them, and I think the award last

03:32.032 --> 03:40.444
year was the height of my career. I want to thank the 
Association

03:40.464 --> 03:49.597
of Former Students. I want to thank you, Dr. 
Campbell. I think we've covered the majority of

03:50.799 --> 03:54.124
the questions, and if I could come back with a few 
specific questions later on as the work evolves.

03:57.209 --> 03:58.812
Yes, I'll stop if you want. Yes, I'd love to have 
that. I'll just give you a little background up to

04:00.535 --> 04:07.249
the time, and then I'll come back and mention it. 
That'll be wonderful.
