WEBVTT

00:02.579 --> 00:08.946
There is really the rare bird, and you use a different type, you know, you took one out.

00:10.207 --> 00:21.960
The rare person that excels in all three, and I don't have any quarrel at all with seeing those people compensated as much as the university president, because they are shining stars.

00:23.983 --> 00:30.730
I feel if you get anybody that excels in any one of those three areas, and they're not a

00:31.064 --> 00:52.617
kind of a problem in the institution otherwise you better keep them i mean that's and i'd advise anybody that you better keep them if you can if you could tell that they really do a great job in any area chances are they're going to be at least minimally involved in one of the others

00:53.440 --> 00:55.786
So that's my thought about it.

00:55.866 --> 01:04.228
In this department down through the years, as far as you're aware, has there really been a merit-reward system?

01:05.512 --> 01:09.863
In other words, there have been merit increases which have varied according to...

01:11.935 --> 01:18.044
And how were, do you have any idea how those judgments were formulated?

01:18.725 --> 01:22.090
Was it by... Pretty much by a personal citizen, that's there.

01:22.430 --> 01:24.032
It was by the department head, General?

01:25.214 --> 01:34.227
Well, I'm sure the department head gets input from others, but no, it's been a department head evaluation.

01:34.247 --> 01:37.572
And as far as you're aware, how did the...

01:37.703 --> 01:43.948
this department's rewards compare with the other major departments in agriculture?

01:45.690 --> 01:47.511
Relatively fairly?

01:47.652 --> 01:50.214
Oh, I'd say, you mean other departments here?

01:51.014 --> 01:51.295
Mm-hmm.

01:51.315 --> 01:52.456
Yeah.

01:52.476 --> 02:01.784
I think, I think we're, we have better, we have better support dollars in this department.

02:01.804 --> 02:03.505
Mm-hmm.

02:03.525 --> 02:06.968
And that's all, I'm going to say, almost all that was marsh blood work.

02:07.083 --> 02:23.334
And I heard Harry Compton say one time, people in soil and crop sciences have more technicians than all the rest of the college put together.

02:23.354 --> 02:25.318
Well, I guess that's true.

02:25.358 --> 02:29.125
If he said it, I suspect it was true.

02:30.252 --> 02:35.018
you know, during the whole rung of years, and we're getting other departments that get pretty strong.

02:35.739 --> 02:36.880
Wildlife and fisheries.

02:38.222 --> 02:44.830
Well, they all look at soil and crop sciences as being the place that's ripe to pick.

02:44.850 --> 02:45.792
The one they want to be.

02:46.292 --> 02:48.074
That's the one they want to steal from.

02:48.255 --> 02:49.376
I mean, they're take from.

02:50.177 --> 02:54.483
So they, of course, they think we're unjustly noted.

02:56.105 --> 02:58.808
The plain simple fact is, if you're going to do field work,

02:59.092 --> 03:05.961
That's a whole different, that is a much different thing than going to the lab, and it's way different than going to the library.

03:06.982 --> 03:12.630
When you start doing field work, that is, you talk about labor-intensive work.

03:13.210 --> 03:16.835
It is costly as it can be.

03:18.057 --> 03:26.027
During the 80s and 90s, if we'd had a knowledgeable group of soil and crop scholars nationally,

03:27.678 --> 03:33.909
this department in general would be in the major leagues nationally with what other schools?

03:38.577 --> 03:41.662
Iowa State, Minnesota.

03:41.682 --> 03:42.604
Did you say Ohio?

03:42.624 --> 03:42.864
Iowa.

03:43.225 --> 03:43.786
Iowa State.

03:43.966 --> 03:45.048
Iowa State.

03:45.068 --> 03:53.382
Minnesota, Wisconsin, Purdue, University of California, Davis.

03:57.412 --> 04:05.021
Probably Illinois, although it's... During the time we've been coming up, some have been going down.

04:05.041 --> 04:07.724
I would put Cornell in that category.

04:07.744 --> 04:11.148
Or you didn't mention another school in the south or southwest?

04:11.648 --> 04:14.712
Well, I was debating whether you mentioned North Carolina State or not.

04:16.574 --> 04:21.900
It would probably be our closest peer in our disciplinary areas in the south.

04:23.095 --> 04:24.397
I don't believe anybody else.

04:24.497 --> 04:31.788
So that you think a knowledgeable group, if they were looking fairly in evaluating, would put us in the top 10?

04:35.434 --> 04:36.735
I think so.

04:36.755 --> 04:36.956
Okay.

04:38.037 --> 04:50.436
During the 70s and 80s, did you and your colleagues feel that agriculture was continuing to get a fair share of the emphasis here on this campus?

04:58.212 --> 04:59.313
I guess so.

04:59.614 --> 05:05.682
I think there's a feeling now that the 2020 vision was pretty warped.

05:05.702 --> 05:06.322
Oh, really?

05:06.342 --> 05:07.063
Yeah.

05:07.083 --> 05:09.406
But agriculture got very little attention.

05:09.426 --> 05:10.167
Oh, really?

05:10.187 --> 05:14.913
In the 2020 vision.

05:15.073 --> 05:23.905
And I take it as being, we're not trying to take away from anybody.

05:23.945 --> 05:28.050
We're trying to build strength in some areas where we don't have any strength.

05:28.503 --> 05:39.147
But I think a lot of people in agriculture and engineering didn't get the attention they deserved in the 2020 vision.

05:41.191 --> 05:42.695
Nothing would be taken away.

05:46.223 --> 05:47.305
Probably just not as good.

06:00.430 --> 06:03.513
on the government's committee on the 2020 vision thing.

06:04.894 --> 06:23.772
And there was quite a lot of interest in getting the agencies under the president, feeling that he can pit the chancellor against the president and goes to one.

06:23.792 --> 06:27.636
And, of course, Dr. Hyler's a very audible man, but at the same time,

06:27.869 --> 06:33.695
He'll play his cards where he thinks they'll play best.

06:34.816 --> 06:39.801
And I have some mixed emotions about that whole thing myself and looking at it.

06:39.921 --> 06:52.514
But the committee recommendation was that we – and Perry Atkinson was a strong supporter of getting the agencies – having the agencies report through the president to the chancellor.

06:52.754 --> 06:53.615
Oh, I didn't know that.

06:53.675 --> 06:54.636
That's in 2020.

06:56.489 --> 06:58.031
It was in the committee.

06:58.432 --> 07:00.495
Oh, oh, oh.

07:00.515 --> 07:02.197
It didn't see the light of day.

07:02.418 --> 07:03.680
Oh, I see.

07:03.700 --> 07:15.477
I mean, it was obviously a potato, a hot potato, wherever decisions were made that they just decided couldn't be dealt with.

07:15.797 --> 07:23.188
Michael Hitt was chair of that committee, and of course there are negotiations within the committee, and that was.

07:23.422 --> 07:27.066
And I won't say it really has received all the attention it probably should have.

07:27.326 --> 07:32.973
Perry was on the committee, so Perry is obviously, Perry had a big impact.

07:35.756 --> 07:38.059
And I think we have a real problem.

07:38.739 --> 07:39.680
I think there's a problem.

07:39.801 --> 07:42.644
I think there needs to be something done there.

07:43.064 --> 07:48.570
Maybe the system now is so large that we won't play the game that we played here for years.

07:48.731 --> 07:49.952
You know what the game was.

07:54.725 --> 08:03.375
and obviously the chancellor then didn't have as much clout as the president in most cases.

08:03.395 --> 08:22.538
Now, do you remember in the last 20 years or so any decision affecting this department that got caught in the situation where the campus was overruled by the deputy chancellor for agriculture?

08:26.180 --> 08:48.188
would it see right right as of today we have 49 faculty on campus and 49 faculty

09:02.832 --> 09:30.105
They have to do.

09:43.433 --> 09:56.346
So we're technologically responsive and presumably to coordinate the program.

09:57.227 --> 10:06.956
So we interact a lot with the research and extension center directors regarding those faculty.

10:07.156 --> 10:10.159
Would all 98 of those have faculty titles?

10:10.420 --> 10:10.740
Yeah.

10:11.547 --> 10:12.769
And they would go?

10:12.829 --> 10:16.995
It's only in recent years that the extension specialists have had faculty titles.

10:17.616 --> 10:23.565
So that, their promotion would officially go through the department.

10:24.066 --> 10:25.348
That's correct.

10:25.448 --> 10:25.828
Tenure?

10:27.771 --> 10:33.219
Well, tenure is only if you have more than 25% university department.

10:33.239 --> 10:34.201
Oh, okay.

10:34.221 --> 10:36.424
So the extension faculty

10:37.788 --> 10:54.312
And if we were to have an accountant to look at the compensation, would there be major differences in the compensation, 49 here and the 49 off-campus?

11:42.149 --> 11:48.757
they can increase by up to 17%, but it's much less than that.

11:49.918 --> 11:53.703
With that grant money thing, bring it in, and they can do that on a year-to-year basis.

11:56.086 --> 12:01.052
Now, if you have a teaching appointment, you can't do that.

12:01.072 --> 12:09.883
You have to do it, you know, you have to go back to 10 months or something like that, and once you've made that decision, you're stuck with it from then on.

12:09.903 --> 12:10.924
So in this department,

12:11.714 --> 12:18.006
We don't have anybody on research and teaching faculty that supplement their salaries.

12:18.026 --> 12:20.170
They're all 12-month appointees.

12:22.154 --> 12:34.498
On the extension side, we only have about, out of 26 or 8 I believe we have now here in the scattered rate, I think we only have 4 or 5 that don't supplement their salaries.

12:34.732 --> 12:47.527
and I'm riding a tough problem right now with an extension faculty who's agreed, and they were encouraging, he's agreed to go 20% teaching and to teach a course.

12:50.510 --> 12:55.676
But since he's done that now, we're having trouble getting permission for him to something himself.

12:57.659 --> 13:00.402
And that means he's volunteered to do something

13:01.090 --> 13:09.562
over and beyond and foster what we're trying to do, and it looks like if we can't get it worked out, he's gonna be penalized for it.

13:09.582 --> 13:15.570
Another thing, there is such a thing as longevity pay for agency people.

13:16.311 --> 13:24.904
So if you have somebody that's 100% either TAES or EX and they go on a teaching appointment, they lose the longevity pay.

13:27.267 --> 13:30.912
And if somebody's been around 20 years, that's pretty significant amount of money.

13:31.617 --> 13:48.778
So there are a lot of things like that that you manipulate between the agencies and all and the university that just really creates some real bad hardships and inequities in the way to do things.

13:48.798 --> 14:01.354
All right, in the last two decades, would you get evaluated both as a faculty member

14:02.735 --> 14:08.150
and a separate evaluation by the Experiment Station and or Extension Service?

14:08.591 --> 14:09.213
It was all one.

14:09.253 --> 14:13.605
No, the evaluation right here goes this person.

14:13.687 --> 14:18.692
has an university appointment, an experimentation appointment, an extension service appointment.

14:18.712 --> 14:24.417
So yours went primarily through the college to the dean to the academic?

14:26.198 --> 14:29.481
Yeah, I don't have 100% teaching appointment, but I did.

14:29.501 --> 14:36.368
I was the only person in the appointment with 100% teaching appointment, 100% university appointment.

14:36.388 --> 14:36.488
Okay.

14:37.369 --> 14:42.293
All right, now normally I'd be asking this question near the end of the interview, but while we're on this topic,

14:42.273 --> 14:50.280
Do you have any recommendation as to how this very complex matter could be handled better in the future?

14:55.905 --> 15:11.419
I guess I don't understand enough about the political machinations to do it, but hopefully, see if we just get the state legislature to visit,

15:13.357 --> 15:22.830
to treat the agencies that are associated with educational entities in the same way the educational entity is treated in terms of the law.

15:23.912 --> 15:29.940
It would be a huge plus for us, a huge plus.

15:29.960 --> 15:38.993
I think the tendency for more joint appointments, extension is, Dr. Heiler really emphasized do it together, do it together.

15:39.698 --> 15:43.963
Extension has historically been very separate from the other two functions here.

15:45.945 --> 15:49.669
He's pulling the human resources group together.

15:49.709 --> 15:51.892
He's pulling the accounting group together.

15:53.033 --> 15:56.718
But there, as somebody said, only some retirements next.

15:58.219 --> 16:00.982
That's where we probably need to be.

16:01.002 --> 16:07.630
And still, even at this point, even as department head and associate head for Extension sits right there in the office next to me,

16:07.880 --> 16:09.563
We have an excellent relationship.

16:09.683 --> 16:18.038
I depend on the guy tremendously, but I also have an associate head, an interim associate head for research.

16:18.439 --> 16:28.477
The relationship between me and the associate head for research is very different than between the associate head for extension.

16:28.637 --> 16:31.322
He more functions,

16:32.500 --> 16:34.882
autonomously than the other.

16:35.143 --> 16:41.569
And in two or three of the, in some of the other major departments in agriculture, the situation would be similar, would it?

16:41.589 --> 16:43.491
Oh sure, yeah.

16:43.511 --> 16:46.755
And there are a few departments that don't have extension, especially Saddam.

16:48.957 --> 16:50.259
Very few would have as many as we do.

16:50.599 --> 16:55.264
Alright, we're looking now in general at the 80s and 90s, those two decades.

16:55.964 --> 16:59.368
During that period, the department leveled off

17:00.732 --> 17:05.237
in number, or did it continue to grow?

17:06.599 --> 17:07.901
Well, a whole lot of things happened.

17:09.202 --> 17:19.635
In 1976, fall of 76, the Department of Horticultural Sciences split from this department.

17:19.655 --> 17:21.137
I mean, it was taken from this department.

17:22.999 --> 17:26.503
In the early 80s, the old Department of Plant

17:27.597 --> 17:30.981
pathology and physiology, broken up.

17:32.963 --> 17:37.629
And then a department of plant pathology and microbiology was formed.

17:39.011 --> 17:44.077
The geneticist in that department went several directions, but we took some of them.

17:45.558 --> 17:49.904
The plant physiologist went several different departments, and we got some of those.

17:51.105 --> 17:52.727
So we inherited

17:53.618 --> 18:22.849
faculty in the 80s I can't remember exactly what year that'd be in the late 80s I guess we certainly have to run games here it had to be in the middle 80s so we lost a group in the mid 70s we were hiring at fast enough pace then that that probably I'd say faculty numbers just very momentarily low decreased probably and the student numbers were

18:22.998 --> 18:51.655
well undergraduate student numbers peaked about 1977 in our department they dropped throughout the 80s they've been a very slow increase but but not more than a 20 percent variation over quite a long time graduate enrollment has been dropping now for about five or six years for a lot of reasons i think you know it's been hard to maintain it in the university as a whole funding for one thing international

18:52.225 --> 19:07.598
I don't think the Republican Congress has been particularly good for international development funds or funds that go into the international military that have a tendency to come back to us in the form of students.

19:07.618 --> 19:19.268
So we lost 19 international students between two fall semesters in numbers, but from 70 to 51 international graduate students between two fall semesters.

19:19.288 --> 19:21.810
I think it's 96, 97, something like that.

19:22.685 --> 19:25.270
And I think it's just a funding problem.

19:25.290 --> 19:30.120
Primarily that was a reduction in federal funding.

19:30.140 --> 19:39.961
Yeah, well it'd be reduction in federal funding that would go to a foreign country and then funnel back here in their education kind of thing.

19:39.981 --> 19:41.905
That's my read on it.

19:41.925 --> 19:43.107
That's the only way I see it.

19:43.576 --> 19:46.759
It's become a lot more expensive, of course, to have a graduate student.

19:47.320 --> 19:54.587
But the health insurance makes it, you know, for grant funds, you just can't carry as many as it used to.

19:55.628 --> 19:59.512
So we've had that, and faculty numbers have gone down.

19:59.812 --> 20:06.759
The teaching FTEs in the department have gone down.

20:07.240 --> 20:09.702
Because we don't, it's hard to justify our

20:10.357 --> 20:18.346
We lost, and I don't know if you're familiar with the provost reallocation among colleges this year on that weighted form of basis that they had.

20:20.429 --> 20:26.215
We lost $5,000 or something.

20:26.255 --> 20:39.250
But then Dr. Heiler did the same thing in the college, only at the university level I think they used a 5% factor and Heiler used a 2.5%.

20:40.057 --> 20:48.148
But we lost about seven, eight thousand of support dollars for teaching.

20:49.330 --> 20:52.575
So see, we lost, as a department, we lost more than the college lost.

20:52.615 --> 20:57.762
So it was going to other departments where the enrollments gone up more.

20:58.619 --> 21:00.421
You mentioned international students.

21:01.022 --> 21:05.506
Trace the international enrollment through your years here.

21:07.909 --> 21:10.331
About how many and from what countries?

21:13.315 --> 21:25.307
Well, it's been several years since I did it, but one year, oh, I picked two or three three-year periods, and we were graduating students from 25 to 30 different countries over a three-year period.

21:25.327 --> 21:26.989
Primarily what parts of the world?

21:28.285 --> 21:40.381
Well, Latin America's probably been our major, usually, until mainland China started releasing students several years ago, whenever that was, 10 years ago, I guess, or 12.

21:41.522 --> 21:45.908
Of course, we have more students from mainland China in the department now than any other single country.

21:45.968 --> 21:47.510
Mexico would probably be second.

21:48.070 --> 21:54.799
Now, are these, as far as you know, who's paying the bill for these mainland Chinese?

21:55.319 --> 21:55.820
We are.

21:56.340 --> 21:56.801
Okay.

21:57.642 --> 22:00.586
And where are they going after they finish their degree?

22:01.026 --> 22:02.028
Staying in the U.S.

22:02.048 --> 22:04.551
of A. True.

22:04.571 --> 22:14.303
I don't know how many we've graduated now, but I'm not sure that any.

22:15.164 --> 22:18.328
We graduated from Pete, Steve, and gone back home.

22:18.348 --> 22:24.516
As far as you are aware, what kind of academic quality do these Chinese students have?

22:26.116 --> 22:28.419
Exceptional.

22:28.439 --> 22:29.260
Hard-working.

22:29.280 --> 22:31.323
Yeah.

22:31.343 --> 22:37.291
They may be hard to understand, but they have much larger vocabulary than most Texans do.

22:38.753 --> 22:43.780
They could outscore us every day of the week on a TOEFL.

22:43.800 --> 22:45.383
They're exceptional.

22:45.663 --> 22:54.435
Now, we observe more and more in a faculty setting that they present some real challenges in management.

22:54.550 --> 23:22.718
just cultural well stubborn out and out stubborn to the point of play like they don't hear stubborn very insistent and and not

23:25.313 --> 23:27.015
I don't know how to say this.

23:28.357 --> 23:29.919
Many of them aren't.

23:30.279 --> 23:32.201
Some are service oriented.

23:32.241 --> 23:38.028
They're not, as a general rule, not terribly materialistic.

23:38.048 --> 23:52.806
But really pushy and a tendency to, I don't say they have a chip on their shoulder at being mistreated, but always feeling there's

23:54.187 --> 23:58.473
There's a way to do it that would, quote, benefit their operation.

23:58.493 --> 24:00.076
Their operation's a little special.

24:00.096 --> 24:05.704
It has a little more needs than somebody else's operation.

24:05.724 --> 24:08.448
I'll just give you an example from today.

24:08.489 --> 24:12.234
Got an email thing going on about some probes.

24:13.075 --> 24:15.880
A faculty member we lost went to the University of Georgia.

24:15.960 --> 24:21.208
He left these clones, these probes, in a freezer upstairs.

24:21.228 --> 24:23.451
Well, we have a new...

24:24.275 --> 24:30.345
colleague who's Asian background, who's working in some of the same area.

24:30.425 --> 24:37.296
Well, he has need for those probes, and the probes are property of this department.

24:37.316 --> 24:38.458
I mean, they were developed here.

24:41.443 --> 24:47.633
We don't have a list of what each one of those things is, and they're worthless without it.

24:49.283 --> 24:59.055
Well, the fellow who left is, I mean, all these guys are kind of saying, they're afraid somebody's gonna get something that they won't get credit for or something of that sort.

25:00.376 --> 25:04.261
So, he emailed back.

25:04.281 --> 25:06.323
The fellow's trying to get the probes.

25:06.383 --> 25:11.950
They said, well, somebody had them, but she said, well, she didn't have authority to release, and it goes on and on.

25:11.970 --> 25:18.177
Anyway, the fellow in Georgia emailed back and said, as soon as I get this agreement about not releasing the thing,

25:18.562 --> 25:25.390
As soon as I get the original signed agreement and the faxed one that you're gonna send me, I'll release the list.

25:26.791 --> 25:33.599
So our fellow emails back and says, the faxed one I understand was mailed yesterday.

25:34.520 --> 25:38.605
If I must sign the original one, I can send it by mail.

25:40.106 --> 25:43.650
So the other email comes back two hours later.

25:43.670 --> 25:45.953
Yes, I said I wanted to reach.

25:47.080 --> 25:51.085
Well, you know, the guy said he needed the original sign.

25:52.286 --> 25:53.928
Why push it?

25:53.948 --> 25:57.893
I mean, it's just like trying to create a little controversy for this.

25:59.575 --> 26:09.407
And treatment sometimes of subordinates is not, and I mean, there are people all across that don't do that right.

26:09.507 --> 26:12.210
But I've had a little problem in that area.

26:13.793 --> 26:21.262
Do these Chinese students, by and large, pass the word on to fellow countrymen to come here?

26:21.703 --> 26:25.548
How do those particular students happen to come here?

26:26.489 --> 26:28.772
What connection is there between A&M and China?

26:29.933 --> 26:32.957
I think they may email 200 people.

26:33.197 --> 26:37.022
They'll email every name they can possibly get as a place to go.

26:37.783 --> 26:42.349
I'm not sure how many we've had come here because

26:42.683 --> 26:45.306
they know something about Texas A&M specifically.

26:45.326 --> 26:50.413
Now it is true that any number of our faculty invested in China.

26:50.433 --> 26:57.802
So there are, and I know Larry Wildings had one or two students come work with him where the contact was established.

26:57.902 --> 27:00.425
I know it was established in China.

27:01.166 --> 27:05.772
But in many cases I get anywhere from three to six

27:06.697 --> 27:11.424
inquiries a day where I have a feeling that email went to 200 people.

27:11.444 --> 27:18.373
But is it primarily a communication from a Chinese student that's here back to them?

27:18.974 --> 27:19.334
That I don't know.

27:19.354 --> 27:22.339
I was wondering, it's not a faculty member from here to there?

27:22.459 --> 27:23.300
No, I don't think so.

27:23.700 --> 27:25.683
No, could be.

27:26.004 --> 27:31.852
I mean, there are exchanges going on all the time, so some of that could be occurring I'm not aware of.

27:31.872 --> 27:33.514
I mean, more like Larry's.

27:33.781 --> 27:37.304
He's had at least two students come just because of the contact.

27:37.745 --> 27:39.827
But I'll tell you what I've actually seen.

27:41.909 --> 28:00.606
Through this door, right out here, this fall, at least, at least 50 and maybe 75 students, mainly from India, maybe Pakistan, graduate students at Texas A&M, looking for assistantships.

28:00.626 --> 28:03.349
And they're in engineering or computer science.

28:03.818 --> 28:08.265
Engineering lost all those dollars and have been losing over the years.

28:08.285 --> 28:12.271
So they admit these students with no financial aid.

28:12.311 --> 28:17.539
Now the student has to prove, you know, they have to prove they can support themselves here before they let them come over here.

28:17.559 --> 28:24.610
But, you know, any enterprising student, they want to be self-supporting as soon as possible, so they're going out hustling the money.

28:25.130 --> 28:32.762
I've seen a one-page printout that is distributed in India

28:33.198 --> 28:35.982
Telling students how to do it.

28:37.103 --> 28:44.353
Get admitted to Texas A&M, go from department to department and locate assistantships.

28:44.373 --> 28:46.136
And many of them get them, too.

28:47.658 --> 28:49.120
They actually line them up.

28:49.841 --> 28:54.066
But I bet we've had at least 75 come here.

28:54.267 --> 28:59.574
And Carol, the administrative assistant next door, gonna tell them there's nothing.

28:59.614 --> 29:00.635
They can't take that.

29:00.735 --> 29:02.698
If my door's open, they'll be over here.

29:03.893 --> 29:15.026
How many of these international students are getting assistantships or other kind of aid that otherwise would have gone to an American national?

29:15.046 --> 29:22.735
Not very few, because you can't find the American national anywhere close to the capabilities these kids have.

29:22.755 --> 29:28.081
I mean, we're talking GREs, 14, 1500, TOEFL, 600, 30, 40.

29:28.562 --> 29:31.685
So no question about their intellectual ability?

29:32.166 --> 29:33.107
Absolutely not.

29:33.847 --> 29:38.094
I mean they're superior.

29:38.174 --> 29:39.977
We're about to finish this take.

29:39.997 --> 29:53.980
Are American nationals getting hired right out of the undergraduate years now more than they used to?

29:54.021 --> 29:57.947
Is that one of the handicaps toward recruiting American national graduate students?

29:58.653 --> 30:01.916
That the corporations are... Yeah, job situations are good for them.

30:02.457 --> 30:03.418
Yeah, I think that's true.

30:04.699 --> 30:07.222
So private industry of all sorts?

30:07.602 --> 30:09.484
And our enrollment's low.

30:09.504 --> 30:18.654
Generally speaking, in the soil and plant areas, our enrollment is relatively low at the undergraduate level in relation to the... Is that true nationally?

30:19.795 --> 30:19.895
Yeah.

30:19.915 --> 30:23.259
So that A&M is not unusual in... I mean, we compete.

30:23.399 --> 30:27.563
You can't leave if you get a domestic student... Mm-hmm.

30:27.695 --> 30:37.127
that finishes any land-grant institution, any land-grant institution with a 3.5, it can score 11 or 1200 on the GRE.

30:37.147 --> 30:40.071
They literally go anywhere they want to go.

30:40.692 --> 30:42.514
I mean, we've had them in here.

30:42.534 --> 30:47.140
We had an Oklahoma State fellow in here and recruited him.

30:48.021 --> 30:52.607
I mean, as hard as we try to recruit a faculty member.

30:52.888 --> 30:53.989
What might y'all offer him?

30:55.471 --> 31:04.580
Well, our standard assistantship rate would be $16,000 this year for a PhD and $14,000 for a master's.

31:04.600 --> 31:13.269
And there's even a little tuition pool that we can offer from now, and a few faculty will supplement even that out of something else.

31:13.289 --> 31:15.532
Is that competitive nationally, as far as you know?

31:15.552 --> 31:17.814
I think so.

31:18.094 --> 31:20.837
It certainly is, if you consider it a health insurance benefit.
