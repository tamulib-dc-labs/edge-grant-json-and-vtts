WEBVTT

00:02.579 --> 00:10.230
There is really the rare burden, and you use a 
different take, you took one out. The rare person

00:10.250 --> 00:21.987
that excels in all three, and I don't have any 
quarrel at all with seeing those people

00:10.250 --> 00:21.987
compensated as much as the university president, 
because they are shining stars. I feel if you get

00:24.030 --> 00:30.780
anybody that excels in any one of those three 
areas, and they're not, kind of a problem in the

00:31.115 --> 01:00.497
institution otherwise you better keep them I mean 
that's and I'd advise anybody that you better keep

00:31.115 --> 01:00.497
them you can if you could tell that they really do a 
great job in any area chances are they're going to

00:31.115 --> 01:00.497
be at least minimally involved in one of the others 
so that's my that's my thought about it all right in

00:31.115 --> 01:00.497
this department down through the years as far as 
you're aware has there really been a merit-reward

01:01.237 --> 01:04.221
system? In other words, there have been merit 
increases which have varied according to... And

01:05.503 --> 01:18.080
how were, do you have any idea how those judgments 
were formulated? Was it by... Pretty much by a

01:19.882 --> 01:22.105
person who sits in this chair. It was by the 
department head, General? Well, I'm sure the

01:25.249 --> 01:29.455
department head gets input from others, but... 
No, it's been a department head evaluation. And as

01:34.259 --> 01:43.956
far as you're aware, how did this department's 
rewards compare with the other major departments

01:34.259 --> 01:43.956
in agriculture? Relatively fairly? Oh, I'd say, 
you mean other departments here? Mm-hmm. Yeah, I

01:52.531 --> 01:54.615
think we're... We have better support dollars in 
this department and that's all I'm going to say.

02:04.945 --> 02:06.848
Almost all that was Marsh Bloodworth. And I heard 
Harry Copland say one time, people in soil and crop

02:08.410 --> 02:23.691
sciences have more technicians than all the rest 
of the college put together.

02:24.380 --> 02:25.321
I guess that's true. If he said it, I suspect it was 
true. And so, you know, during the whole run of

02:28.705 --> 02:35.073
years, and we're getting other departments that 
are getting pretty strong. Wildlife and

02:35.754 --> 02:36.895
fisheries. Well, they all look at soil and crop 
sciences as being the place that's ripe to pick.

02:44.885 --> 02:45.846
The one they want to be. That's the one they want to 
steal from. I mean, take from. So they, of course,

02:50.211 --> 02:53.475
they think we're unjustly The plain simple fact 
is, if you're going to do field work, that's a whole

02:53.810 --> 03:06.986
different, that is a much different thing than 
going to the lab, and it's way different than going

02:53.810 --> 03:06.986
to the library. When you start doing field work, 
that is, you talk about labor-intensive work. It

03:12.572 --> 03:17.218
is as costly as it can be. During the 80s and 90s, if 
we'd had a knowledgeable group of soil and crop

03:17.958 --> 03:38.578
scholars nationally,

03:17.958 --> 03:38.578
this department in general would be in the major 
leagues nationally with what other schools?

03:38.598 --> 03:41.681
Iowa State, Minnesota. Did you say Ohio? Iowa 
State. Iowa State. Minnesota, Wisconsin.

03:48.552 --> 03:53.218
Purdue,

03:48.552 --> 03:53.218
University of California, Davis.

03:57.483 --> 04:05.033
Probably Illinois, although it's,

03:57.483 --> 04:05.033
during the time we've been coming up, some have 
been going down. I would put Cornell in that

04:05.053 --> 04:07.756
category. Or you didn't mention another school in 
the South or Southwest? Well, I was debating

04:11.381 --> 04:14.965
whether to mention North Carolina State or not. It 
would probably be our closest here in our

04:16.295 --> 04:21.904
disciplinary areas in the South. I don't believe 
anybody else would. So that you think a

04:24.529 --> 04:31.821
knowledgeable group, if they were looking fairly 
and evaluating, would put us in the top ten?

04:34.786 --> 04:35.747
I think so. Okay. During the 70s and 80s, did you and 
your colleagues feel that agriculture was

04:41.810 --> 04:50.319
continuing to get a fair share of the emphasis here 
on this campus?

04:58.387 --> 04:59.408
I guess so. I think there's a feeling now that the 
2020 vision was pretty worked. Oh, really? Yeah.

05:07.196 --> 05:09.479
But agriculture got very little attention. Oh, 
really?

05:13.923 --> 05:23.896
And

05:13.923 --> 05:23.896
I take it as being, we're not trying to take away 
from anybody. We're trying to build strength in

05:23.936 --> 05:28.663
some areas where we don't have any strength. But I 
think a lot of people in agriculture and

05:28.683 --> 05:41.079
engineering didn't get the attention they 
deserved in the 2020 vision.

05:41.099 --> 05:43.002
Not that things would be taken away, but Probably 
just not as much attention to it. It's a

05:49.376 --> 05:54.843
real governance problem. I don't know what the 
solution is. It's on the governance committee on

05:58.228 --> 06:03.595
the 2020 vision thing. And there's quite a lot of 
interest in getting the agencies under the

06:04.917 --> 06:13.268
president. Feeling that... he can pit the 
chancellor against the president and goes to one.

06:23.793 --> 06:33.728
And of course, Dr. Tyler is a very honorable man, 
and at the same time, he'll play his cards where he

06:23.793 --> 06:33.728
thinks he'll play best. And I have some mixed 
emotions about that whole thing myself, and

06:34.849 --> 06:39.957
looking at it. But the committee recommendation 
was that we, and Perry Atkinson was a strong

06:39.977 --> 06:45.405
supporter, of getting the agencies, having the 
agencies report through the president to the

06:46.415 --> 06:52.503
chancellor. Oh, I didn't know that. That's in 
2020. It's not in 2020. Oh, oh. It was in the

06:56.869 --> 06:58.091
committee. Oh, oh, oh. It didn't see the light of 
day. Oh, I see. I mean, it was obviously a hot potato

07:03.738 --> 07:13.131
wherever decisions were made that they just 
decided it couldn't be. couldn't be dealt with

07:14.461 --> 07:43.995
michael hitt was chair of that committee and of 
course there's there are negotiations within the

07:14.461 --> 07:43.995
committee and that one and and and i won't say it was 
really received all the attention you probably

07:14.461 --> 07:43.995
should have perry was on the committee so perry's 
obviously period had a big impact

07:14.461 --> 07:43.995
and i think we have a real problem i mean i i think 
there's a problem i think there needs to be

07:14.461 --> 07:43.995
something done there early but maybe maybe The 
system now is so large that we won't play the game

07:44.110 --> 07:48.575
that we played here for years. You know what the 
game was.

07:54.962 --> 08:02.590
And

07:54.962 --> 08:02.590
obviously the chancellor then didn't have as much 
clout as the president in most cases. Now, do you

08:03.331 --> 08:12.261
remember in the last 20 years or so any decision 
affecting this department that got caught in the

08:13.878 --> 08:36.932
situation where that the president where the 
campus was overruled by the deputy chancellor for

08:13.878 --> 08:36.932
agriculture

08:13.878 --> 08:36.932
would it

08:13.878 --> 08:36.932
you see right right as of today We have 49 faculty on 
campus and 49 faculty

08:38.279 --> 08:48.214
.

09:02.877 --> 09:03.578
There you go.

09:29.208 --> 09:48.186
We're

09:29.208 --> 09:48.186
technologically

09:29.208 --> 09:48.186
responsible. And presumably.

10:00.882 --> 10:06.950
Extension, I mean the Research and Extension 
Center directors, regarding those faculty.

10:07.170 --> 10:10.195
Would all 98 of those have faculty titles? Yeah. 
And they would go... It's only in recent years that

10:12.978 --> 10:17.024
the Extension specialists have had faculty 
titles. So that, their promotion would

10:17.645 --> 10:23.593
officially go through the department. That's 
correct. Tenure? Well, 10 years only if you have

10:27.713 --> 10:36.305
more than 25% university employment. Oh, okay. 
And if we were to have an accountant to look at the

10:38.167 --> 10:49.242
compensation, what is the major differences in 
the compensation? 49 here and the 49 off-campus?

11:36.682 --> 11:48.798
They

11:36.682 --> 11:48.798
can increase by up to up to 17%, but less than that. 
With that grant money thing, bring it in and they

11:49.960 --> 11:53.705
can do that on a year to year basis. Now, if you have a 
teaching appointment. You can't do that. You have

12:01.158 --> 12:08.388
to go back to 10 months or something like that and 
once you've made that decision, you're stuck with

12:01.158 --> 12:08.388
it from then on. So in this department, we don't 
have anybody on research and teaching faculty

12:09.911 --> 12:18.042
that supplement their salaries. They're all 12 
month appointees. On the extension side, We only

12:24.303 --> 12:34.874
have about, out of 26 or eight I believe we have now 
here in Scattergrave, I think we only have four or

12:24.303 --> 12:34.874
five that don't supplement their salaries. And 
I'm writing a tough problem right now with an

12:34.894 --> 12:47.568
extension faculty who's agreed, and they've been 
encouraging, he's agreed to go 20% teaching and to

12:34.894 --> 12:47.568
teach a course.

12:50.531 --> 12:53.314
But since he's done that now, we're having trouble 
getting permission for him to supplement his

12:53.699 --> 12:57.645
salary. And that means he's volunteered to do 
something over and gone and foster what we're

12:57.665 --> 13:03.855
trying to do. And it looks like if we can't get it 
worked out, he's going to be penalized for it.

13:09.604 --> 13:15.613
Another thing, there is such thing as longevity 
pay for agency people. So if you have somebody

13:16.334 --> 13:20.280
that's 100% either TAES and they go on a teaching 
appointment, they lose their longevity pay. And

13:27.266 --> 13:30.310
if somebody's been around 20 years, that's pretty 
significant amount of money. So there are a lot of

13:32.332 --> 13:47.972
things like that that you manipulate between the 
agencies and all and the university that just

13:32.332 --> 13:47.972
really creates some real bad hardships and 
inequities in the way you do things. All right, in

13:48.577 --> 14:08.561
these

13:48.577 --> 14:08.561
last two decades, would you get evaluated both as a 
faculty member and a separate evaluation by the

13:48.577 --> 14:08.561
Experiment Station and or Extension Service? It 
was all one? No, the evaluation's right here,

14:09.262 --> 14:17.993
because this person has an university 
appointment, Experiment Station appointment,

14:09.262 --> 14:17.993
and Extension Service appointment. So yours went 
primarily through the college to the dean to the

14:18.597 --> 14:24.444
academic? Yeah, I don't have a hundred percent 
teaching point, but I did. I was the only person in

14:29.531 --> 14:33.736
the department with a hundred percent teaching 
point. A hundred percent university. Okay. All

14:36.340 --> 14:45.972
right, now normally I'd be asking this question 
near the end of the interview, but while we're on

14:36.340 --> 14:45.972
this topic, do you have any recommendation as to 
how this very complex matter could be handled

14:46.829 --> 14:50.293
better in the future?

14:55.919 --> 15:00.543
I guess I don't understand enough about the 
political machinations to do it. But

15:00.584 --> 15:14.338
hopefully, see if we just get the state 
legislature to treat the agencies that are

15:14.588 --> 15:44.055
associated with educational entities in the same 
way the educational entity is treated in terms of

15:14.588 --> 15:44.055
the law it would be a huge plus for us a huge plus i 
think i think the tendency for more joint

15:14.588 --> 15:44.055
appointments extension is dr holler really 
emphasized do it together do it together

15:14.588 --> 15:44.055
extension has historically been very separate 
from the other two functions here He's pulling the

15:45.082 --> 15:49.608
human resources group together. He's pulling the 
accounting group together. But there, as

15:53.073 --> 15:56.738
somebody said, only some retirements from that. 
That's where we probably need to be. And still,

16:01.024 --> 16:09.596
even at this point, even as department head and 
associate head for extensions that's right there

16:01.024 --> 16:09.596
in the office next to me, we have an excellent 
relationship. I depend on the guy tremendously.

16:12.840 --> 16:14.903
But I also have an associate head an interim 
associate head for research, that the

16:15.203 --> 16:28.481
relationship between me and the associate head 
for research is very different than between the

16:15.203 --> 16:28.481
associate head for extension. He's more, he more 
functions autonomously than the other. And in two

16:35.191 --> 16:41.520
or three of the, and some of the other major 
departments in agriculture, the situation would

16:35.191 --> 16:41.520
be similar, would it? Oh sure, yeah. And there are a 
few departments that don't have extension,

16:43.385 --> 16:48.953
especially Sedona. Very few would have as many as 
we do. Right. We're looking now in general at the

16:51.758 --> 16:55.283
80s and 90s, those two decades. During that 
period, the department leveled off in number, or

16:55.984 --> 17:05.318
did it continue to grow? No. Well, a whole lot of 
things happened. In 1976,

17:13.051 --> 17:19.641
Fall of 76, the Department of Horticultural 
Sciences split from this department. I mean, it

17:19.661 --> 17:22.987
was taken from this department. In the early 80s, 
the old Department of Plant Pathology and

17:23.007 --> 17:31.039
Physiology had broken up. And then a Department of 
Plant Pathology and Microbiology was formed. The

17:39.072 --> 17:40.915
geneticists in that department went several 
directions, but we took some of them. The plant

17:45.567 --> 17:49.952
physiologist went to several different 
departments, and we got some of those. So we

17:51.093 --> 17:57.620
inherited faculty in the 80s. I can't remember 
exactly what year that'd be in the late 80s, I

17:57.740 --> 18:01.084
guess. It was certainly after Runge was here. It 
had to be in the middle 80s. So we lost a group in the

18:04.747 --> 18:08.852
mid-70s. We were hiring at fast enough pace then 
that probably, I'd say, faculty numbers just very

18:10.493 --> 18:29.016
momentarily low, decreased probably, and 
student numbers were, well, undergraduate

18:10.493 --> 18:29.016
student numbers peaked about 1977 in our 
department. They dropped throughout the 80s.

18:30.738 --> 18:38.087
They've been a very slow increase, but not more 
than 20% variation over quite a long time.

18:38.793 --> 18:46.823
Graduate enrollment has been dropping now for 
about five or six years for a lot of reasons, I

18:38.793 --> 18:46.823
think. It's been hard to maintain it in the 
university as a whole. Funding, for one thing,

18:49.726 --> 18:52.350
international. I don't think the Republican 
Congress has been particularly good for

18:52.370 --> 19:06.707
international

18:52.370 --> 19:06.707
development funds or funds that go into the 
international military that have a tendency to

18:52.370 --> 19:06.707
come back to us in the form of students. so we lost we 
lost 19 international students between two fall

19:07.531 --> 19:29.151
semesters in numbers went from 70 to 51 
international graduate students between two

19:07.531 --> 19:29.151
fall semesters i think it's 96 97 something like 
that and i think it's just a funding problem

19:07.531 --> 19:29.151
primarily that was a reduction in federal Yeah, 
well, it'd be reduction in federal funding that

19:29.671 --> 19:39.446
would go to a foreign country and then funnel back 
here in their education kind of thing. That's my

19:39.907 --> 19:41.930
read on it. It's the only way I see it. It's become a 
lot more expensive, of course, to have a graduate

19:43.692 --> 19:54.649
student, but the health insurance, you know, for 
grant funds, this can't carry as many as it used to.

19:55.540 --> 19:59.528
So that we've had that, and faculty numbers have 
gone down. The teaching FTEs in the department

19:59.829 --> 20:06.782
have

19:59.829 --> 20:06.782
gone down. Because we don't, it's hard to justify 
our, we lost in the, I don't know if you're familiar

20:07.323 --> 20:16.722
with the provost reallocation among colleges 
this year on that weighted form

20:27.772 --> 20:39.042
Then Dr. Hyler did the same thing in the college, 
only at the university level, I think they used a 5%

20:27.772 --> 20:39.042
factor, and Hyler used a 2.5%. But we lost about 
$7,000, $8,000 of support dollars for teaching.

20:49.351 --> 20:52.594
So see, we lost, as a department, we lost more than 
the college lost. So it was going to other

20:52.634 --> 20:57.778
departments where the enrollment's gone up more. 
You mentioned international students. Trace the

21:01.035 --> 21:05.499
international enrollment through your years 
here. About how many and from what countries?

21:13.346 --> 21:25.337
Well, it's been several years since I did it, but 
one year, I picked two or three three-year

21:13.346 --> 21:25.337
periods, and we were graduating students from 25 
to 30 different countries over a three-year

21:13.346 --> 21:25.337
period. Primarily what parts of the world? Well, 
Latin America has probably been our major,

21:28.319 --> 21:40.391
usually, until mainland China started releasing 
students several years ago, whenever that was, 10

21:28.319 --> 21:40.391
years ago, I guess, or 12. Of course, we have more 
students from mainland China in the department

21:41.552 --> 21:45.937
now than any other single country. Mexico would 
probably be second. Now, are these, as far as you

21:48.079 --> 21:54.205
know, who's paying the bill for these mainland 
Chinese? Oh, we are. Okay, and where are they going

21:56.247 --> 22:00.592
after they finish their degree? Staying in the 
U.S. of A. I don't know how many we've graduated

22:01.113 --> 22:14.308
now, but

22:01.113 --> 22:14.308
I'm not sure that any. We graduated from Ph.D. 
level and gone back home. As far as you are aware,

22:18.373 --> 22:24.600
what kind of academic quality do these Chinese 
students have? Exceptional. Hard working. Yeah.

22:31.355 --> 22:37.320
They may be hard to understand, but they have much 
larger vocabulary than most Texans do. They could

22:38.761 --> 22:43.786
outscore us every day of the week on the TOEFL. 
They're exceptional. And now we observe more and

22:45.467 --> 22:56.157
more in a faculty setting that they present some 
real challenges in management. Describe. Well,

22:57.213 --> 23:03.323
stubborn. Out and out stubborn. To the point of, 
they play like they don't hear more than that.

23:13.019 --> 23:13.580
Stubborn. Very insistent. And not

23:25.347 --> 23:27.069
I don't know how to say this. Many of them aren't. 
Some are service oriented. They're not as a

23:32.157 --> 23:38.045
general rule not terribly materialistic. But 
really pushy and a tendency to

23:38.065 --> 23:52.806
I don't say they have a chip on their shoulder being 
mistreated but always feeling there's a There's a

23:54.220 --> 23:58.366
way to do it that would, quote, benefit their 
operation. Their operation's a little special.

24:00.108 --> 24:04.794
It has a little more needs than somebody else's 
operation. I'll just give you an example from

24:05.735 --> 24:07.818
today. I got an email thing going on about some 
probes. Well, a faculty member we lost went to the

24:13.025 --> 24:15.829
University of Georgia. He left these probes in a 
freezer upstairs. Well, we have a new... who's

24:24.342 --> 24:30.373
Asian background, who's working in some of the 
same area. Well, he has need for those probes, and

24:30.453 --> 24:37.285
the probes are property of this department. I 
mean, they were developed here.

24:41.452 --> 24:47.683
We don't have a list of what each one of those things 
is, and they're worthless without it. Well, the

24:49.317 --> 25:00.371
fellow who left is, I mean, all these guys are kind 
of saying they're afraid somebody's going to get

24:49.317 --> 25:00.371
something that they won't get credit for or 
something of that sort. So he emailed back. The

25:04.316 --> 25:06.398
fellow's trying to get the problems. They said, 
well, somebody had them. And she said, well, she

25:07.760 --> 25:10.083
didn't have authority to release. And it goes on 
and on. Anyway, the fellow in Georgia emailed back

25:11.965 --> 25:18.193
and said, as soon as I get this agreement about not 
releasing things, As soon as I get the original

25:18.562 --> 25:25.411
signed agreement and the faxed one that you're 
going to send me, I'll release the list. So our

25:26.832 --> 25:33.621
fellow emails back and says, the faxed one I 
understand was mailed yesterday. If I must sign

25:34.542 --> 25:38.607
the original one, I can send it by mail. So the other 
email comes back two hours later. Yes, I said I

25:43.693 --> 25:45.936
wanted to release. Well, you know, the guy said he 
needed the original sign board. Why push it? I

25:54.031 --> 25:57.937
mean, it's just like trying to create a little 
controversy. And treatment sometimes of

25:58.197 --> 26:09.535
subordinates is not, and I mean, there are people 
all across that don't do that right. But I've had a

26:09.555 --> 26:12.700
little problem in that area before. Do these 
Chinese students, by and large, pass the word on to

26:13.810 --> 26:21.277
fellow countrymen to come here? How do those 
particular students happen to come here? What

26:26.502 --> 26:28.805
connection is there between A&M and China? Well, 
Astro, I think they may email 200 people. They'll

26:33.209 --> 26:37.233
email every name they can possibly get as a place to 
go. I'm not sure how many we've had come here

26:37.794 --> 26:42.298
because. they know something about Texas A&M 
specifically. Now, it is true that any number of

26:45.458 --> 26:49.523
our faculty visited in China. So there are, and I 
know Larry Wildings had one or two students come

26:50.445 --> 26:57.835
work with him where the contact was established. I 
know it was established in China. But in many

27:00.298 --> 27:11.053
cases, I get anywhere from three to six inquiries a 
day where I have a feeling that email went to 250.

27:11.405 --> 27:18.232
But is it primarily a communication from a Chinese 
student that's here back to them? That I don't

27:18.252 --> 27:19.353
know. I was wondering, it's not a faculty member 
from here to there. No, I don't think so. No, could

27:24.338 --> 27:25.980
be. I mean, there are changes going on all the time. 
So some of that could be occurring I'm not aware of.

27:31.866 --> 27:33.187
I mean, more like Larry's. He's had at least two 
students come just because of the contact. But

27:37.812 --> 27:39.994
I'll tell you what I've actually seen. through 
this door, right out here, this fall, at least, at

27:41.020 --> 28:00.619
least 50, and maybe 75 students, mainly from 
India, maybe Pakistan, graduate students at

27:41.020 --> 28:00.619
Texas A&M, looking for assistantships. And 
they're in engineering or computer science.

28:04.322 --> 28:05.784
Engineering lost all those dollars. They have 
been losing them. So they admit these students.

28:10.282 --> 28:12.285
with no financial aid. Now, a student has to prove. 
They have to prove they can support themselves

28:13.707 --> 28:16.691
here before they let them come over here. But any 
enterprising student, they want to be

28:17.552 --> 28:22.840
self-supporting as soon as possible. So they're 
going out hustling the money. I've seen a one-page

28:25.143 --> 28:36.058
printout that is distributed in India telling 
students how to do it. Get admitted to Texas A&M.

28:39.931 --> 28:43.137
from department to department, locate 
assistantships. And many of them get them, too.

28:47.666 --> 28:49.149
They actually line them up. But I'll bet we've had 
at least 75 come here. And Carol, the

28:53.958 --> 28:59.629
administrative assistant next door, go tell them 
there's nothing. They can't take that. If my

29:00.771 --> 29:02.935
door's open, they'll build it here. How many of 
these international students are getting

29:03.910 --> 29:13.703
assistantships or other kind of aid that 
otherwise would have gone to an American

29:03.910 --> 29:13.703
national? Very few, because you can't find the 
American national anywhere close to the

29:15.205 --> 29:21.154
capabilities these kids have. I mean, we're 
talking GREs, 14, 1500, TOEFL, 600, 30, 40. So no

29:28.584 --> 29:31.688
question about their intellectual ability. 
Absolutely not. right you're you're i mean

29:33.880 --> 30:03.820
they're superior all right uh we're about to 
finish this take and you can't find that you can't

29:33.880 --> 30:03.820
find

29:33.880 --> 30:03.820
that are american nationals getting hired right 
out of the undergraduate years now more than they

29:33.880 --> 30:03.820
used to is that one of the handicaps toward 
recruiting american national graduate students

29:33.880 --> 30:03.820
that the corporations are job situations to do it 
for them yeah i think that's true uh so private

30:04.036 --> 30:28.052
industry and of all sorts and our enrollment's low 
generally speaking in the soil and plant areas our

30:04.036 --> 30:28.052
enrollment is relatively low at the 
undergraduate level in relation to the is that

30:04.036 --> 30:28.052
true nationally yeah so that a m is not unusual in i 
mean we compete you can't believe if you get a a

30:04.036 --> 30:28.052
domestic student that finishes any land grant 
institution, any land grant institution with a

30:28.184 --> 30:36.813
3.5, it can score 11 or 1200 on the GRE. They can 
literally go anywhere they want to go. I mean,

30:40.117 --> 30:42.520
we've had them in here. We had an Oklahoma State 
fellow in here and recruited him. I mean, it's hard

30:48.046 --> 30:51.029
as we try to recruit a faculty member. What kind of, 
what might y'all offer him? Well, our standard

30:55.505 --> 31:04.675
assistantship rate would be $16,000 this year for 
a PhD and $14,000 for a master's. There's even a

31:04.696 --> 31:13.305
little tuition pool that we can offer from now, and 
a few faculty will supplement even that out of

31:04.696 --> 31:13.305
something else. Is that competitive nationally, 
as far as you know? I think so. It certainly is if you

31:18.131 --> 31:20.854
consider the health insurance benefit.
