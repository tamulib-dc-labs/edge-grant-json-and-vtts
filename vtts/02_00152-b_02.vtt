WEBVTT

00:03.090 --> 00:10.260
There is really the rare burden, and you use a 
different tape, you'll get one out. The rare

00:10.240 --> 00:15.540
person that excels in all three, and I don't have 
any quarrel at all with seeing those people

00:15.520 --> 00:23.830
compensated as much as the university president, 
because they are shining stars. I feel if you get

00:23.810 --> 00:29.470
anybody that excels in any one of those three 
areas, and they're not a kind of a problem in the

00:29.450 --> 00:39.620
institution otherwise, you better keep them, and 
I'd advise anybody that you better keep them, if

00:39.600 --> 00:47.120
you can tell that they really do a great job in any 
area. Chances are they're going to be at least

00:47.100 --> 00:53.120
minimally involved in one of the others. So that's 
my thought about it. All right, in this department

00:55.480 --> 00:59.900
down through the years, as far as you're aware, Has 
there really been a merit-reward system? In other

01:05.490 --> 01:10.050
words, there have been merit increases which have 
varied according to... And how were, do you have

01:10.030 --> 01:17.800
any idea how those judgments were formulated? Was 
it by... Pretty much by a personal system, that's

01:19.920 --> 01:22.020
fair. It was by the department head, General? 
Well, I'm sure the department head gets input from

01:25.000 --> 01:31.660
others, but no, it's been a department head. And as 
far as you're aware, how did this department's

01:34.250 --> 01:41.680
rewards compare with the other major departments 
in agriculture? Relatively? Fairly? Oh, I'd say,

01:47.480 --> 01:50.180
you mean other departments here? Mm-hmm. Yeah. I 
think, I think we're, in the bar, we have better, we

01:52.230 --> 02:01.220
have better support dollars in this department. 
Mm-hmm. And that's all I'm going to say. I think

02:04.660 --> 02:06.920
almost all that was marsh blood work. Mm-hmm. 
And... And I heard Harry Coughlin say one time,

02:08.700 --> 02:18.170
people in soil and crop sciences have more 
technicians than all the rest of the college put

02:18.150 --> 02:20.690
together.

02:24.300 --> 02:25.261
I guess that's true. If he said it, I suspect it was 
true. And so, you know, during the whole run of

02:28.580 --> 02:34.060
years, and we're getting other departments that 
are getting pretty strong. Mm-hmm. Wildlife and

02:35.912 --> 02:37.520
fisheries and agri-culture. Well, they all look 
at soil and crop sciences. Being the... The one.

02:43.380 --> 02:45.800
The one they want to be. So they, of course, they 
think we're unjustly loaded, and the plain,

02:45.780 --> 02:57.810
simple fact is, if you're going to do field work, 
that's a whole different, that is a much different

02:57.790 --> 03:02.170
thing than going to the lab, and it's way different 
than going to the library. When you start doing

03:06.270 --> 03:12.920
field work, that is, you talk about 
labor-intensive work, it is, it is... It's as

03:13.388 --> 03:15.520
costly as it can be. If we, during the 80s and 90s, if 
we'd had a knowledgeable group of soil and crop

03:16.200 --> 03:24.200
scholars nationally,

03:24.180 --> 03:33.180
this department in general would be in the major 
leagues nationally with what other schools?

03:38.440 --> 03:38.925
Iowa State. All right. Minnesota. Did you say 
Ohio? Iowa. Iowa. Iowa State. Minnesota.

03:46.170 --> 03:46.617
Wisconsin. Wisconsin. Fort

03:47.250 --> 03:53.264
Wayne-Davis.

03:57.475 --> 04:03.910
Well, Illinois, although it's,

03:57.475 --> 04:03.910
during the time we've been coming up, some have 
been going down. I would put Cornell, but that's

04:04.823 --> 04:06.730
everywhere. Or you didn't mention another school 
in the South or Southwest? Well, I was debating

04:11.260 --> 04:14.720
whether to mention North Carolina State or not. It 
would probably be our closest peer in our

04:16.470 --> 04:21.870
disciplinary areas in the South. I believe 
anybody else would. So that you think a

04:24.390 --> 04:30.430
knowledgeable group, if they were looking fairly 
and evaluating, would put us in the top? Top ten.

04:34.580 --> 04:35.071
Okay. That's the department, yeah. During the 70s 
and 80s, did you and your colleagues feel that

04:37.800 --> 04:46.440
agriculture was continuing to get a fair share of 
the emphasis here on this campus? I

04:50.860 --> 04:59.380
guess so. I think there's a feeling now that the 
2020 vision was pretty warped. Oh, really? Yeah.

05:06.860 --> 05:08.780
But agriculture got very little attention. Oh, 
really? In the 2020s. And

05:10.540 --> 05:24.330
I

05:10.540 --> 05:24.330
take it as being, we're not trying to take away from 
anybody, we're trying to build strength in some

05:24.310 --> 05:26.890
areas where we don't have any strength. But I think 
a lot of people in agriculture and engineering

05:28.350 --> 05:34.530
didn't get the attention they deserved in the 2020 
vision.

05:40.880 --> 05:54.350
Things would be taken away, but

05:40.880 --> 05:54.350
probably just not as much attention to it or it's

05:40.880 --> 05:54.350
a problem. I don't know. I don't know what the 
solution is. It's obvious that it's on the

05:56.970 --> 06:03.600
government's committee, on the 2020 vision 
thing. And there's quite a lot of interest in

06:04.730 --> 06:14.190
getting the agencies under the president,

06:04.730 --> 06:14.190
feeling that he can pit the chancellor against the 
president. It goes to one. And, of course, Dr.

06:22.290 --> 06:26.080
Eiler is a very honorable man. But at the same 
time... I mean, he'll play his cards where he

06:27.020 --> 06:34.920
thinks he'll play best. And I have some mixed 
emotions about that whole thing myself and

06:34.900 --> 06:40.080
looking at it. But the committee recommendation 
was that we, and Perry Atkinson was a strong

06:40.060 --> 06:46.060
supporter of getting the agencies, having the 
agencies report through the president to the

06:46.040 --> 06:52.340
chancellor. Oh, I didn't know that. That's in 
2020. It's not in 2020. Oh, oh. It was in the

06:56.621 --> 06:57.361
beginning. It didn't... Oh. It didn't see the 
light of day. Oh, I see. I mean, it was obviously a

07:02.800 --> 07:12.480
potato, hot potato wherever decisions are made 
that they just decided it couldn't be dealt with.

07:15.930 --> 07:19.850
Michael Hitt was chair of that committee. And, of 
course, there are negotiations within the

07:19.830 --> 07:23.850
committee. And I won't say it really received all 
the attention it probably should have. Perry was

07:27.330 --> 07:28.351
on the committee. So Perry is... obviously period 
had a big impact and I think we have a real problem. I

07:38.778 --> 07:39.821
think there's a problem. I think there needs to be 
something done there. Maybe the system now is so

07:42.930 --> 07:48.562
large that we won't play the game that we played 
here for years. You know what the game was. And

07:49.930 --> 08:02.180
obviously the chancellor then didn't have as much 
clout as the president in most cases. Now do you

08:02.160 --> 08:22.420
remember in the last 20 years or so any decision 
affecting this department that got caught in the

08:02.160 --> 08:22.420
situation where the campus was overruled by the 
deputy chancellor for agriculture? Right

08:22.400 --> 08:41.830
as of today, we have 49 faculty on campus and 49 
faculty. Some of the orders

08:41.810 --> 09:44.940
they

08:41.810 --> 09:44.940
have to

08:41.810 --> 09:44.940
do are

08:41.810 --> 09:44.940
over 10. They're technologically responsible. 
And presumably we have to coordinate the program.

09:51.520 --> 09:54.690
Let's say we have a research program. We interact

09:54.670 --> 10:07.250
a lot with the research and extension center 
directors regarding those faculty. Would all 98

10:07.230 --> 10:10.250
of those have faculty titles? Yeah. And they would 
go... It's only in recent years that the extension

10:13.230 --> 10:17.250
specialists have had faculty titles. So that... 
That would go back about 10 years. Their promotion

10:19.230 --> 10:24.250
would officially go through the department. 
That's correct. Tenure? Well, tenure is only if

10:28.080 --> 10:33.100
you have more than 25% university employment. Oh, 
okay. The extension faculty do not... And if we

10:38.120 --> 10:51.360
were to have an accountant to look at the 
compensation, what is the major differences in

10:38.120 --> 10:51.360
the compensation? 49 here and the 49 off campus? 
They

10:53.340 --> 11:50.010
can increase by up to 17%, but much less than that. 
With that grant money, they can bring it in, and

11:49.990 --> 11:56.280
they can do that on a year-to-year basis. Now, if 
you have a teaching appointment, you can't do

11:56.260 --> 12:00.490
that. You have to do it, you know, you have to go back 
to 10 months or something like that. And once

12:05.470 --> 12:09.930
you've made that decision, you're stuck with it 
from then on. So in this department, we don't have

12:09.910 --> 12:13.930
anybody on research. And teaching faculty that 
supplement their salaries. They're all 12-month

12:17.910 --> 12:21.850
appointees. On the extension side, we only have 
about... Out of 26 or eight, I believe we have now,

12:24.980 --> 12:34.000
here in Scattergrass, I think we only have four or 
five that don't supplement their salaries. And

12:33.980 --> 12:43.000
I'm riding a tough problem right now with an 
extension faculty who's agreed, and they've been

12:33.980 --> 12:43.000
encouraging... He's agreed to go 20% teaching and 
to teach a course. But since he's done that now,

12:47.980 --> 12:55.940
we're having trouble getting permission for him 
to supplement his salary. And that means he's

12:55.920 --> 13:03.800
volunteered to do something over and beyond and 
foster what we're trying to do. And it looks like if

13:03.780 --> 13:08.800
we can't get it worked out, he's going to be 
penalized for it. Another thing, there is such a

13:08.780 --> 13:14.800
thing as longevity pay for agency people. So if you 
have somebody that's 100% either T-A-E-S or

13:15.780 --> 13:26.500
T-A-E-X, and they go on a teaching appointment, 
they lose their longevity pay. And if somebody's

13:26.480 --> 13:31.580
been around 20 years, that's pretty significant 
amount of money. So there are a lot of things like

13:31.560 --> 13:38.580
that that you manipulate between the agencies and 
all that... And the university that just really

13:38.560 --> 13:45.580
creates some real bad hardships. And inequities 
in the way you do things. Alright, in these

13:48.560 --> 14:08.000
last two decades, would you get evaluated both as a 
faculty member and a separate evaluation by the

13:48.560 --> 14:08.000
Experiment Station and or Extension Service? Or 
is it all one? No, the evaluation's right here,

14:08.980 --> 14:15.000
because this person has an university 
appointment, Experiment Station appointment,

14:08.980 --> 14:15.000
and Extension Service. Okay. Okay. And this 
person has an Extension Service appointment. So

14:18.980 --> 14:25.570
yours went primarily through the college to the 
dean to the academic. Yeah, I don't have a 100%

14:25.550 --> 14:29.570
teaching appointment, but I did. I was the only 
person in the department with a 100% teaching

14:29.550 --> 14:33.570
appointment. 100% university appointment. 
Okay. Alright, now normally I'd be asking this

14:37.397 --> 14:46.570
question near the end of the interview, but while 
we're on this topic, do you have any

14:37.397 --> 14:46.570
recommendation as to how this very complex matter 
could be handled better in the future?

14:55.730 --> 15:06.160
I guess I don't understand enough about the 
political machinations to do it, but

14:55.730 --> 15:06.160
hopefully. See, if we just get the state 
legislature to treat the agencies that are

15:06.140 --> 15:19.240
associated with educational entities in the same 
way the educational entity is treated. Okay. In

15:20.004 --> 15:26.260
terms of the law, it would be a huge plus for us. I

15:26.240 --> 15:39.010
think the tendency for more joint appointments, 
Extension is, Dr. Heiler really emphasized do it

15:26.240 --> 15:39.010
together, do it together. Extension has 
historically been very separate from the other

15:38.990 --> 15:44.010
two functions here. He's pulling the human 
resources group together. He's pulling the

15:49.040 --> 15:51.060
accounting group together. Okay. But there is, 
somebody said, only some retirements

15:53.046 --> 16:00.730
from this. And still, even at this point, even as 
department head and associate head for Extension

16:00.710 --> 16:09.730
sits right there in the office next to me, and we 
have an excellent relationship. I depend on the

16:09.710 --> 16:12.730
guy tremendously. But I also have an associate 
head, an interim associate head for research. The

16:17.710 --> 16:24.780
relationship between me and the associate head 
for research is very different. He's

16:24.760 --> 16:35.130
more, he more functions autonomously than the 
other. And in two or three of the, in some of the

16:35.110 --> 16:41.130
other major departments in agriculture, the 
situation would be similar, would it? Oh, sure.

16:42.355 --> 16:43.130
Yeah. And there are a few departments that don't 
have Extension, especially Sedona. Very few

16:47.110 --> 16:50.080
would have as many as we do. All right. We're 
looking now in general at the 80s and 90s, those two

16:51.777 --> 16:54.080
decades. Okay. During that period, the 
department leveled off in number and, or did it

16:54.742 --> 17:04.870
continue to grow? Yeah. No. Well, a whole lot of 
things happened. In 1976, fall of 76, the

17:09.850 --> 17:18.900
Department of Horticultural Sciences split from 
this department. I mean, it was taken from this

17:18.880 --> 17:20.900
department. Right. In the early 80s, the old 
Department of Plant and Agricultural Sciences

17:23.023 --> 17:24.620
split. The old Department of Plant Pathology and 
Physiology had broken up. And then a Department of

17:33.000 --> 17:38.020
Plant Pathology and Microbiology was formed. The 
geneticists in that department went several

17:38.000 --> 17:45.340
directions, but we took some of them. The plant 
physiologists went to several different

17:45.320 --> 17:50.340
departments, and we got some of those. So, we 
inherited faculty in the 80s. I can't remember

17:55.840 --> 18:00.860
exactly what year that'd be in the late 80s, I 
guess. We certainly have to run games here. It had

18:01.840 --> 18:02.861
to be in the middle 80s. So, we lost a group in the 
mid-70s. We were

18:03.840 --> 18:16.860
hiring at a fast enough pace then that probably, 
I'd say, faculty numbers just very momentarily

18:16.840 --> 18:23.860
low, decreased probably, and student numbers 
were, well, undergraduate student numbers

18:23.840 --> 18:24.861
peaked about 1970. Oh, yeah. 1977 in our 
department. They dropped throughout the 80s.

18:28.000 --> 18:37.020
They've been a very slow increase, but not more 
than a 20% variation over quite a long time.

18:38.930 --> 18:45.040
Graduate enrollment has been dropping now for 
about five or six years for a lot of reasons, I

18:45.020 --> 18:45.746
think. You know, it's been hard to maintain it in 
the university as a whole. Funding, for one thing.

18:51.020 --> 18:51.646
International. I don't think the Republican 
Congress has been particularly good for that. I

18:55.020 --> 19:01.040
don't think it's been particularly good for 
international

18:55.020 --> 19:01.040
development funds or funds that go into the 
international military that have a tendency to

19:01.020 --> 19:06.040
come back to us in the form of students. So, we lost 
19 international students between two fall

19:07.020 --> 19:14.040
semesters in numbers, went from 70 to 51 
international graduate students between two

19:14.020 --> 19:19.040
fall semesters. I think it's 96, 97, something 
like that. And I think it's just a funding problem.

19:22.020 --> 19:23.102
Yeah. Yeah. Primarily that was a reduction in 
federal funding. Yeah. Well, it'd be reduction in

19:30.246 --> 19:35.320
federal funding that would go to a foreign country 
and then funnel back here in their education.

19:37.300 --> 19:37.688
Okay. Okay. That kind of thing. That's my read on 
it. It's the only way I don't see it. to. So, I think

19:44.565 --> 19:46.320
it's been a lot harder. I think it's been a lot 
harder. I think it's been a lot harder. I think it's

19:48.300 --> 19:49.321
been a lot harder. I think it's been a lot harder. I 
think it's been a lot harder. I think it's been a lot

19:51.300 --> 19:52.321
harder. It's been a lot harder. So, we've had that. 
And faculty numbers have gone down.

19:58.300 --> 19:59.793
the college. At the university level I think they 
use a 5% factor, and that's more than what any of our

20:02.800 --> 20:08.070
colleges produce. We waving up – I was staying in 
college then,

20:08.050 --> 20:31.560
the

20:08.050 --> 20:31.560
Kerry Valleyaczego level. And then, baseball – 
it's hard to justify it. And then we lost over

20:35.840 --> 20:36.931
there. Okay.

20:40.160 --> 20:49.410
But we lost about $7,000-$8,000

20:40.160 --> 20:49.410
of support dollars for teaching. So see, we lost, 
as a department, we lost more than the college

20:49.390 --> 20:52.710
lost. So it was going to other departments where 
the enrollment's gone up more. You mentioned

20:58.340 --> 21:01.360
international students. How did you face the 
international enrollment through your years

21:01.340 --> 21:08.180
here? About how many and from what countries? 
Well, it's been several years since I did it, but

21:10.580 --> 21:18.630
one year, I picked two or three three-year 
periods, and we were graduating students from 25

21:18.610 --> 21:23.490
to 30 different countries over a three-year 
period. Primarily what parts of the world? Well,

21:28.120 --> 21:32.660
Latin America's probably been our major. 
Usually. Well, until Mainland China started

21:33.546 --> 21:38.480
releasing students several years ago, whenever 
that was. Ten years ago, I guess, or twelve. Of

21:40.460 --> 21:45.630
course, we have more students from Mainland China 
than any other single country. Mexico would

21:45.610 --> 21:47.630
probably be second. Now, are these, as far as you 
know, who's paying the bill for these Mainland

21:47.610 --> 21:54.200
Chinese? Oh, we are. Okay. And where are they going 
after they finish their degree? Staying in the

22:00.420 --> 22:02.440
U.S. of A. That's right. I don't know. I don't know 
how many we've graduated now, but I'm not sure that

22:04.740 --> 22:15.200
any that we've graduated from Ph.D. level have 
gone back home. As far as you are aware, what kind of

22:18.380 --> 22:24.640
academic quality do these Chinese students have? 
Exceptional. Hard-working. Yeah. They may be

22:28.690 --> 22:32.220
hard to understand, but they have much larger 
vocabulary than most Texans do. That's right.

22:34.833 --> 22:35.220
That's right. That's right. That's right. That's 
right. That's right. They can outscore us every

22:39.020 --> 22:41.040
day of the week on the TOEFL. They're exceptional. 
Now, we observe more and more in a faculty setting

22:43.776 --> 22:47.920
that they present some real challenges in 
management. Just cultural. Describe. Well,

22:51.663 --> 22:52.520
stubborn. Just out and out stubborn to the point 
of, they play like they don't hear more than that.

23:06.410 --> 23:08.689
Stubborn. They don't listen. Stubborn. 
Stubborn. Stubborn.

23:15.587 --> 23:15.990
Stubborn. Very insistant. And not, I

23:18.435 --> 23:29.820
don't

23:18.435 --> 23:29.820
know how to say this. Many of them aren't. Many of 
them. Some are service oriented. They're not.

23:33.494 --> 23:34.820
They're not, as a general rule, not terribly 
materialistic. Mmhm.

23:38.066 --> 23:50.630
But really pushy and a tendency to,

23:38.066 --> 23:50.630
I don't say they have a chip on their shoulder of But 
always feeling there's a way to do it that would,

23:50.610 --> 23:58.380
quote, benefit their operation. Their 
operation's a little special. It has a little more

24:00.100 --> 24:04.640
needs than somebody else's operation. I'll just 
give you an example from today. I got an email thing

24:08.300 --> 24:12.060
going on about some probes. A faculty member we 
lost went to the University of Georgia. He left

24:15.590 --> 24:19.210
these probes in a freezer upstairs. Well, we have a 
new colleague who's Asian background, who's

24:19.190 --> 24:30.350
working in some of the same area. Well, he has need 
for those probes, and the probes are property of

24:30.470 --> 24:37.200
this department. I mean, they were developed 
here.

24:41.320 --> 24:47.480
We don't have a list of what each one of those things 
is, and they're worthless without it. Well, the

24:49.000 --> 24:53.780
fellow who left is, I mean, all these guys are kind 
of, they're afraid somebody's going to get

24:53.880 --> 24:59.040
something that they won't get credit for or 
something of that sort. So he emailed back. The

25:04.310 --> 25:06.310
fellow's trying to get the probes. They said, 
well, somebody had them, but she said, well, she

25:06.330 --> 25:11.250
didn't have authority to release, and it goes on 
and on. Anyway, the fellow in Georgia emailed back

25:11.670 --> 25:14.030
and said, as soon as I get this agreement about not 
releasing the thing, as soon as I get the original

25:18.530 --> 25:23.130
signed agreement and the faxed one that you're 
going to send me, I'll release it. So our fellow

25:25.010 --> 25:29.630
emails back and says, and the faxed one I 
understand was mailed yesterday. If I must sign

25:33.640 --> 25:38.560
the original one, I can send it by mail. So the other 
email comes back two hours later. Yes, I said I

25:43.550 --> 25:46.900
wanted to release it. Well, you know, the guy said 
he needed the original signed one. Why push it? I

25:53.910 --> 25:56.690
mean, it's just like trying to create a little, you 
know, controversy, but it's not it. And treatment

25:59.510 --> 26:03.450
sometimes with subordinates is not, and I mean, 
there are people all across that don't do that

26:04.810 --> 26:09.370
right. But I've had a little problem in that area 
before. Do these Chinese students, by and large,

26:17.290 --> 26:21.290
pass the word on to fellow countrymen to come here? 
How do those particular students happen to come

26:21.690 --> 26:25.570
here? What connection is there? What's the 
connection between A&M and China? Oh, ask them. I

26:29.890 --> 26:32.910
think they may email 200 people. They'll email 
every name they can possibly get as a place to go.

26:36.890 --> 26:40.910
I'm not sure how many we've had come here because 
they know something about Texas A&M

26:40.890 --> 26:44.910
specifically. Now, it is true that any number of 
our faculty visited in China. So, you know, there

26:49.890 --> 26:55.410
are, and I know Larry Wildings had one or two 
students come work with him, that were the contact

26:55.390 --> 26:57.390
was the state. I know it was established in China. 
But in many cases, I get anywhere from three to six

26:59.870 --> 27:07.890
inquiries a day where I have a feeling that email 
went to 200 people. But is it primarily a

27:11.370 --> 27:18.390
communication from a Chinese student that's here 
back to them? That I don't know. I was wondering,

27:19.370 --> 27:22.390
it's not a faculty member from here to there. No, I 
don't think so. No, it could be. I mean, there are

27:25.470 --> 27:27.490
exchanges going on. They're going on all the time. 
So some of that could be occurring I'm not aware of.

27:31.970 --> 27:37.990
I mean, more like Larry's, he's had at least two 
students come just because of the contact. But

27:37.970 --> 27:42.240
I'll tell you what I've actually seen. Through 
this door, right out here, this fall, at least 50

27:42.220 --> 27:52.520
and maybe 75 students, mainly from India, maybe 
Pakistan, graduate students at Texas A&M,

27:57.560 --> 28:00.260
looking for assistantships. And they're in 
engineering or computer science. Engineering

28:04.240 --> 28:06.260
lost all those dollars. And they have been losing 
them. So they admit these students with no

28:08.240 --> 28:12.260
financial aid. Now, a student has to prove, you 
know, they have to prove they can support

28:12.240 --> 28:15.260
themselves here before they let them come over 
here. But, you know, any enterprising student,

28:17.240 --> 28:22.760
they want to be self-supporting as soon as 
possible. So they're going out hustling the

28:22.740 --> 28:24.760
money. I've seen a one-page, printout that is 
distributed in India telling students how to do

28:28.440 --> 28:36.460
it. Get admitted to Texas A&M. Go from department 
to department. Locate assistantships. And many

28:44.403 --> 28:46.700
of them get them, too. They actually line them up. 
But I'll bet we've had at least 75 come here. And

28:53.090 --> 28:58.110
Carol, the administrative assistant next door, 
go tell them, there's nothing. They can't take

28:59.621 --> 29:01.110
that. If I know where it's open, they'll be over 
here. How many of these international students

29:03.090 --> 29:08.460
are getting assistantships or other kind of aid 
that otherwise would have gone to an American

29:08.440 --> 29:14.930
national? Very few. You can't find the American 
national anywhere close to the capabilities

29:15.957 --> 29:20.930
these kids have. Oh, okay. All right. I mean, we're 
talking GREs, 14, 1500, hopeful, 600, 30, 40. I

29:28.910 --> 29:29.931
mean, they're superior. All right. We're about to 
finish this take. And you can't find that. You

29:34.180 --> 29:35.201
can't find that. they used to? the corporations 
are? Yeah. The job situations. Yeah, I think

29:41.620 --> 29:42.641
that's true. Okay.

29:46.073 --> 29:46.840
Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank 
you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you.

29:54.820 --> 29:55.881
Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank 
you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you.

30:05.311 --> 30:05.760
Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. And I 
think it's gonna get better in the future. Yeah, I

30:09.740 --> 30:10.761
think it's true. So private industry and of all 
sorts? And our enrollment's low. the

30:13.740 --> 30:16.679
undergraduate level in relation to the . . . Is that 
true nationally? Yup. So that A&M is not unusual in

30:19.936 --> 30:22.437
. . . Well, I mean, we can beat . . . a domestic student 
finishes any land grant institution, any land

30:29.030 --> 30:32.050
grant institution, with a 3.5, it can score 
several students. It can get to a good grade. Yeah.

30:34.373 --> 30:40.630
11 or 1200 on the GRE, they can literally go 
anywhere they want to go. I mean we've had them in

30:40.610 --> 30:46.830
here, we had an Oklahoma State fellow in here and 
recruited him. I mean it's hard if we try to recruit

30:48.041 --> 30:51.150
a faculty member. What kind of? What might y'all 
offer him? Well, our standard assistantship rate

30:54.130 --> 31:01.810
would be $16,000 this year for a Ph.D. and $14,000 
for a master's. There's even a little tuition pool

31:03.790 --> 31:10.110
that we can offer from now and a few faculty will 
supplement even that out of something else. Is

31:13.330 --> 31:17.080
that competitive nationally as far as you know? I 
think so. It certainly is if you consider the

31:18.060 --> 31:20.780
health insurance benefit.
