WEBVTT

00:03.090 --> 00:10.260
There is really the rare burden, and you use a 
different tape, you'll get one out. The rare

00:10.240 --> 00:15.540
person that excels in all three, and I don't have 
any quarrel at all with seeing those people

00:15.520 --> 00:23.830
compensated as much as the university president, 
because they are shining stars. I feel if you get

00:23.810 --> 00:29.430
anybody that excels in any one of those three 
areas, and they're not a kind of a problem in the

00:29.410 --> 00:39.640
institution otherwise, you better keep them, and 
I'd advise anybody that you better keep them, if

00:39.620 --> 00:47.080
you can tell that they really do a great job in any 
area. Chances are they're going to be at least

00:47.060 --> 00:53.080
minimally involved in one of the others. So that's 
my thought about it. All right, in this department

00:55.500 --> 00:59.900
down through the years, as far as you're aware, No. 
Has there really been a merit-reward system? In

01:05.470 --> 01:09.830
other words, there have been merit increases 
which have varied according to... Yeah, yeah. And

01:12.119 --> 01:17.800
how were, do you have any idea how those judgments 
were formulated? Was it by... Pretty much by a

01:19.940 --> 01:22.020
personal system, that's fair. It was by the 
department head, General? Well, I'm sure a

01:25.200 --> 01:31.640
department head gets input from others, but no, 
it's been a department head. That's not the point.

01:33.240 --> 01:34.761
It's about the verification. And as far as you're 
aware, how did this department's rewards compare

01:34.740 --> 01:43.060
with the other major departments in agriculture? 
Relatively? Fairly? Oh, I'd say, you mean other

01:46.374 --> 01:47.700
departments here? Uh-huh. Yeah. I think. I think 
we're, we have better... We have better support

01:57.200 --> 02:02.540
dollars in this department. And... That's all. 
going to say almost all that was marsh blood work.

02:08.391 --> 02:15.530
And I heard Harry Copeland say one time, people in 
soil and crop sciences have more technicians than

02:15.510 --> 02:20.090
all the rest of the college put together.

02:24.502 --> 02:25.284
I guess that's true. If he said it, I suspect it was 
true. And so, you know, during the whole run of

02:30.880 --> 02:34.900
years, and we're getting other departments that 
are getting pretty strong while out in fisheries.

02:38.261 --> 02:41.460
Well, they all look at soil and crop sciences as 
being the place that's ripe to pick. The one they

02:44.869 --> 02:47.824
want to be there to take from. So they, of course, 
they think we're unjustly loaded. The plain

02:56.380 --> 02:58.970
simple fact is, if you're going to do field work, 
that's a whole different, that is a much different

02:58.950 --> 03:03.267
thing than going to the lab. And it's way different 
than going to the library. When you start doing

03:07.012 --> 03:08.160
field work, that is, you talk about labor 
intensive work, it is costly as it can be. If we,

03:16.440 --> 03:24.140
during the 80s and 90s, if we'd had a knowledgeable 
group of soil and crop scholars nationally,

03:24.680 --> 03:33.320
this department in general would be in the major 
leagues nationally with what other schools?

03:37.187 --> 03:39.020
Ohio State. Did you say Ohio? Iowa. Iowa State. 
Minnesota, Wisconsin,

03:45.074 --> 04:05.089
Fort Wayne, Davis,

03:45.074 --> 04:05.089
probably Illinois, although it's,

03:45.074 --> 04:05.089
during the time we've been coming up, some have 
been going down. I would put Cornell. Okay. Or you

04:07.761 --> 04:10.920
didn't mention another school in the South or 
Southwest? Well, I was debating whether to

04:11.260 --> 04:14.730
mention North Carolina State or not. It would 
probably be our closest here in our disciplinary

04:16.575 --> 04:21.870
areas in the South. So

04:21.850 --> 04:31.770
that you think a knowledgeable group, if they were 
looking fairly and evaluating, would put us in the

04:21.850 --> 04:31.770
top ten?

04:34.600 --> 04:34.982
Okay. During the 70s and 80s, did you and your 
colleagues feel that agriculture was continuing

04:37.500 --> 04:50.240
to get a fair share of the emphasis here on this 
campus? I

04:50.220 --> 04:59.391
guess so. I think there's a feeling now that it's 
2021. The vision was pretty warped. Oh, really?

05:06.350 --> 05:06.593
Yeah. But agriculture got very little attention. 
Oh, really? In the 2020 vision. And

05:11.220 --> 05:23.690
I take it as being, we're not trying to take away 
from anybody. We're trying to build strength in

05:23.910 --> 05:26.890
some areas where we don't have any strength. But I 
think a lot of people in agriculture and

05:28.330 --> 05:36.910
engineering didn't get the attention they 
deserved in the 2020 vision. Things would be taken

05:38.690 --> 05:54.350
away, but

05:38.690 --> 05:54.350
probably just not as much attention to it or not

05:38.690 --> 05:54.350
a problem. I don't know what the solution is. It's 
obvious that we're on the governance committee on

05:56.510 --> 06:03.620
the 2020 vision thing. And there's quite a lot of 
interest in getting the agencies under the

06:04.810 --> 06:11.410
president. Feeling that this work can, he can pit 
the check. He can put the chancellor against the

06:19.150 --> 06:23.360
president, and it goes to one. And of course, Dr. 
Hyler is a very honorable man, and at the same time,

06:23.340 --> 06:33.360
he'll play his cards where he thinks he'll play 
best. And I have, you know, I have some mixed

06:33.340 --> 06:40.360
emotions about that whole thing myself, and I've 
been looking at it. But the committee

06:40.340 --> 06:47.760
recommendation was that we, and Perry Atkinson 
was a strong supporter of getting the agencies,

06:47.740 --> 06:50.140
having the agencies are represented. And I also 
took a report through the president to the

06:50.120 --> 06:54.140
chancellor. Oh, I didn't know that. That's in 
2020. That's not in 2020. It was in the committee.

06:58.460 --> 06:59.481
Oh, oh, oh. It didn't see the light of day, the 
committee. I mean, it's obviously a potato, a hot

07:00.460 --> 07:15.650
potato, wherever decisions were made that they 
just decided couldn't be dealt with. Michael Hitt

07:15.630 --> 07:17.650
was chair of that committee. Of course, there's 
negotiations within the committee and out. Yeah.

07:20.536 --> 07:22.250
Yeah. And I won't say it really received all the 
attention it probably should have. Perry was on

07:27.230 --> 07:34.250
the committee, so obviously Perry had a big 
impact. And I think we have a real problem. I think

07:38.783 --> 07:39.850
there's a problem. I think there needs to be 
something done there. Maybe the system now is so

07:42.830 --> 07:48.850
large that we won't play the game that we played 
here for years. We didn't know

07:48.830 --> 07:58.080
what the game was. And obviously the chancellor 
then didn't have as much clout as the president in

07:58.060 --> 08:03.580
most cases. Do you remember in the last 20 years or 
so any decision affecting this department that

08:10.560 --> 08:32.950
got caught in the situation where the campus was 
overruled by the deputy chancellor for

08:10.560 --> 08:32.950
agriculture?

08:32.930 --> 08:33.393
Would it? See, right as of today, we have four 
departments. Forty-nine faculty on campus and

08:38.710 --> 08:41.730
forty-nine faculty. They have to

08:41.710 --> 09:46.840
do what

08:41.710 --> 09:46.840
we're technologically responsible for. And 
presumably do the core of the program. Let's say

09:51.420 --> 09:54.590
the research program. We interact

09:54.570 --> 10:07.150
a lot with the research and extension center 
directors regarding those faculty. Would all 98

10:07.130 --> 10:10.150
of those have faculty titles? Yeah. And they would 
go... Yeah, I see. And it's only in recent years

10:13.130 --> 10:17.150
that the extension specialists have had faculty 
titles. So that would go back about ten years.

10:20.130 --> 10:24.150
Their promotion would officially go through the 
department. That's correct. Tenure? Yeah. Well,

10:28.239 --> 10:33.000
tenure is only if you have more than 25% university 
employment. Oh, okay. The extension faculty do

10:34.311 --> 10:38.040
not... And if we were to have an accountant to look 
at the compensation,

10:46.190 --> 10:51.260
what would be the major differences in the 
compensation? Forty-nine here and the

10:51.240 --> 10:53.260
forty-nine off campus? Yeah.

11:42.187 --> 11:47.690
They

11:42.187 --> 11:47.690
can increase it by up to 17%. Much less than that. 
With that grant money, they can bring it in. And

11:51.890 --> 11:56.180
they can do that on a year-to-year basis. Now, if 
you have a teaching appointment, you can't do

11:56.160 --> 12:00.390
that. You have to do it, you know, you have to go back 
to ten months or something like that. And once

12:05.370 --> 12:07.390
you've made that decision, you're stuck with it 
from then on. So in this department, we don't have

12:07.370 --> 12:16.830
anybody on research and teaching faculty that 
supplement their salaries. They're all

12:18.014 --> 12:18.830
twelve-month appointees. On the extension side, 
we only have about, out of 26 or eight, I believe we

12:18.810 --> 12:24.900
have now, here in Scattergrass, I think we only 
have four or five that don't supplement their

12:24.880 --> 12:33.900
salaries. I don't know. I don't know. I don't know. 
I don't know. I don't know. And they six

12:39.880 --> 12:43.900
disposition faculty, who's agreed, and they have 
been encouraging, he's agreed to vote 20 percent

12:43.880 --> 12:46.900
teaching and to teach a course. But

12:46.880 --> 12:57.700
since he's done that now, he's, we're having 
trouble getting permission from him to

12:57.680 --> 12:58.701
supplement his salary. And that means he's 
volunteered to do something over and gone, and

12:58.680 --> 13:03.700
foster what we are trying to do and looks like we 
can't get it worked out. He's going to be penalized

13:08.680 --> 13:09.701
for it. Another thing. There is such thing as 
longevity pay for agency people. So if you have

13:16.280 --> 13:21.300
somebody that's 100% either T-A-E-S or T-A-E-X 
and they go on a teaching appointment, they lose

13:23.580 --> 13:25.101
their longevity pay. And if somebody's been 
around 20 years, that's pretty significant

13:28.960 --> 13:30.940
amount of money. So there are a lot of things like 
that that you manipulate between the agencies and

13:34.920 --> 13:38.420
all that, and a university that just really 
creates some real bad hardships and inequities in

13:46.920 --> 13:48.620
the way you do things. All right, in these

13:48.600 --> 13:53.780
last two decades, would you get evaluated both as a 
faculty member and a separate evaluation by the

14:02.780 --> 14:06.760
experiment station and or extension service? 
There's all one. The evaluation's right here

14:11.660 --> 14:15.220
because this person has an university 
appointment, experiment station appointment,

14:16.620 --> 14:18.660
and extension service appointment. So yours went 
primarily through the college to the dean to the

14:22.080 --> 14:24.620
academic. Yeah, I don't have 100% teaching 
appointment, but I did, I was the only person in the

14:28.830 --> 14:31.750
department with 100% teaching appointment, 100% 
university appointment. Okay, all right, now

14:35.730 --> 14:38.190
normally, I'd be asking this question near the end 
of the interview, but while we're on this topic, do

14:42.410 --> 14:46.890
you have any recommendation as to how this very 
complex matter could be handled better in the

14:46.870 --> 14:50.590
future?

14:55.910 --> 14:57.630
I guess I don't understand enough about your 
political machinations to do it, but is,

15:00.670 --> 15:05.690
hopefully, see if we just get the state 
legislature

15:09.560 --> 15:13.820
to be, to visit, to treat the, agencies that are 
associated with educational entities in the same

15:14.560 --> 15:20.660
way the educational entity is treated in terms of 
the law it would be a huge plus for us i think i think

15:20.640 --> 15:32.790
the tendency for more joint appointments 
extension is dr holler really emphasized do it

15:32.770 --> 15:38.790
together do it together extension has 
historically been very separate from the other

15:39.570 --> 15:43.910
two functions here uh he's pulling up you know he's 
pulling the human resources group together he's

15:43.890 --> 15:50.520
pulling the accounting group together but there 
is somebody said only some retirements

15:50.500 --> 16:01.550
from next and still even at this point even as a 
department head and associate head for extension

16:01.530 --> 16:06.350
sits right there in the office next to me and we have 
an excellent relationship i depend on the guy

16:06.330 --> 16:11.950
tremendously but i also have an associate head an 
interim associate head for research that the

16:17.690 --> 16:24.960
relationship between me and the associate head 
for research is very different than between the

16:24.940 --> 16:33.390
associate head for extension he's he's more he 
more functions autonomously than the other and in

16:34.170 --> 16:39.950
two or three of the and some of the other major 
departments in agriculture the situation would

16:39.930 --> 16:45.150
be similar would it oh sure yeah and there are a few 
departments that don't have extension

16:45.130 --> 16:48.820
specialists that don't um a few would have as many 
as we do all right we're looking now in general at

16:48.960 --> 16:54.180
the 80s and 90s those two decades during that 
period the department leveled off in a number and

17:03.190 --> 17:14.010
or did it continue no uh well a whole lot of things 
happened in 1976 fall of 76

17:15.060 --> 17:19.720
the department of horticultural sciences split 
from this department i mean in was taken from us. In

17:23.014 --> 17:28.780
the early 80s the old department of plant 
pathology and physiology broken up and then a

17:28.760 --> 17:36.140
department of plant pathology and microbiology 
was formed. The geneticists in that department

17:39.034 --> 17:42.310
went several directions. We took some of them. The 
plant physiologist went several different

17:47.640 --> 17:48.703
departments. We got some of those. We inherited 
faculty in the 80s. I can't remember exactly what

17:57.749 --> 18:01.560
year that would be in the late 80s. It would 
probably have to run us here. It had to be in the

18:02.586 --> 18:04.719
middle 80s. So we lost a group in the mid 70s. We were 
hiring at a fast enough pace then that probably I'd

18:08.864 --> 18:15.620
say faculty numbers just varied momentarily. 
low, decreased probably, in student numbers.

18:23.111 --> 18:24.600
Well, undergraduate student numbers peaked 
about 1977 in our department. They dropped

18:29.052 --> 18:30.220
throughout the 80s. They've been a very slow 
increase, but not more than 20% variation over

18:35.840 --> 18:37.873
quite a long time. Graduate enrollment has been 
dropping now for about five or six years for a lot of

18:42.140 --> 18:45.768
reasons, I think. You know, it's been hard to 
maintain it in the university as a whole. Funding,

18:49.718 --> 18:51.673
for one thing, international. I don't think the 
Republican Congress has been particularly good

18:52.560 --> 18:59.080
for international development funds or funds 
that go into the international military that have

19:03.040 --> 19:06.670
a tendency to come back to us in the form of 
students. So we lost, we lost 19 international

19:07.960 --> 19:14.420
students between two fall semesters in numbers, 
went from 70 to 51 international graduate

19:14.400 --> 19:17.420
students. Between two fall semesters. I think 
it's 96, 97, something like that. And I think it's

19:22.933 --> 19:24.200
just a funding problem. Primarily, that was a 
reduction in federal funding. Yeah, it would be a

19:30.140 --> 19:36.140
reduction in federal funding that would go to a 
foreign country and then funnel back here in their

19:30.140 --> 19:36.140
education. OK, OK. That's my read on it. That's the 
only way I know to see it. It's become a lot more

19:39.142 --> 19:41.700
expensive to have a graduate student. That's my 
read on it. That's the only way I know to see it. It's

19:45.264 --> 19:47.560
become a lot more expensive to have a graduate 
student. health insurance care makes it you know

19:47.540 --> 19:52.680
for grant funds this can't carry as many as they 
used to so that we've had that and faculty numbers

19:52.660 --> 19:59.880
have gone down the teaching FTEs in the department 
have gone down because we don't it's hard to

20:08.990 --> 20:13.110
justify we lost and I don't know if you're familiar 
with the Provost reallocation among colleges

20:13.090 --> 20:29.820
this year on that

20:13.090 --> 20:29.820
weighted form

20:13.090 --> 20:29.820
then

20:13.090 --> 20:29.820
Dr. Heiler did the same thing in the college only at 
the university level I think they use a five

20:34.300 --> 20:42.760
percent factor and Heiler used a two and a half 
percent but we lost we lost about seven eight

20:42.740 --> 20:49.870
thousand of support dollars for teaching so see we 
lost as a department we lost more than the college

20:49.850 --> 20:53.610
lost so there was it was going to other departments 
where the enrollments gone up more you mentioned

20:59.220 --> 21:00.601
international students you mentioned 
international students trace the international

21:00.580 --> 21:08.100
enrollment through your years here from him about 
how many and from what countries

21:08.080 --> 21:15.370
well it's been a several years since I did it but one 
year oh I picked two or three three-year periods

21:15.350 --> 21:20.330
and we were graduating students from 25 to 30 
different countries over a three-year period

21:24.170 --> 21:30.920
primarily what parts of the world well Latin 
America's probably been our major usually until

21:30.900 --> 21:37.760
until mainland China started releasing students 
several years ago whenever that was ten years ago

21:37.740 --> 21:42.950
guess or twelve of course we have more students 
from mainland China in the department now than any

21:42.930 --> 21:46.490
other single country Mexico would probably be 
second now are these as far as you know who's paying

21:46.470 --> 21:52.680
the bill for these mainland Chinese oh we are okay 
and where are they going after they finish their

21:59.660 --> 22:02.480
degree staying in the U.S. of A. sure I don't know we 
I don't know how many we've graduated now but I'm

22:04.040 --> 22:13.480
I'm not sure that any we graduated from Ph.D. level 
and gone back home as far as you are aware what kind

22:18.040 --> 22:23.760
of academic quality do these Chinese students 
have exceptional hard-working yeah they may be

22:23.740 --> 22:33.800
hard to understand but but they have much larger 
vocabulary than most Texans do they get out scores

22:37.500 --> 22:47.160
every day of the week a mm potential

22:37.500 --> 22:47.160
and now we observe more than more and more enough in 
a faculty setting that they present some real

22:52.400 --> 23:05.710
challenges and management just go troll 
described

22:52.400 --> 23:05.710
well stubborn happens stubborn to the point of 
play like they don't hear I don't never give up a

23:12.040 --> 23:12.562
knock straps very insistent, and not,

23:13.380 --> 23:31.780
I don't

23:13.380 --> 23:31.780
know how to say this, many of them aren't, some are 
service oriented, they're not, as a general rule,

23:31.760 --> 23:43.250
not terribly materialistic, but really pushy, 
and a tendency to,

23:43.230 --> 23:52.730
I don't say they have a chip on their shoulder being 
mistreated, but always feeling there's a there's

23:52.710 --> 23:58.514
a way to do it that would benefit their operation. 
Their operation's a little special. It has a

24:00.000 --> 24:04.809
little, little more needs than somebody else's 
operation. I'll just give you an example from

24:06.720 --> 24:07.804
today. I got an email thing going on about some 
probes, and one faculty member we lost went to

24:14.690 --> 24:19.470
University of Georgia, they left these, these 
probes, in the freezer upstairs. Well, we have a

24:19.450 --> 24:24.190
new colleague who's Asian background who's 
working in some of the same area well he he has need

24:24.390 --> 24:32.430
for those probes and the probes are property of the 
of this department I mean they were developed here

24:41.240 --> 24:47.420
we don't have the list of what each one of those 
things is and they're worthless without it well

24:49.220 --> 24:54.680
the fellow who left is I mean all these all these 
guys are kind of saying they're afraid somebody's

24:54.660 --> 25:00.500
going to get something that they won't get credit 
for or something of that sort so he emailed back the

25:02.690 --> 25:07.990
fellas trying to get the the probes they said well 
somebody had them but she said well she didn't have

25:07.970 --> 25:13.110
authority to release and it goes on and on anyway 
the fellow in Georgia emailed back and said as soon

25:13.090 --> 25:18.710
as I get this agreement about not releasing the 
thing as soon as I get the original signed

25:18.690 --> 25:24.870
agreement and the faxed one that you're going to 
send me I'll release the list so our fella emails

25:24.850 --> 25:34.180
back and says the faxed one I understand was mailed 
yesterday if if I must sign the original one I could

25:34.160 --> 25:42.370
send it by mail so the other email comes back two 
hours later yes I said I wanted to reach well you

25:42.350 --> 25:50.620
know the guy said he needed the original sign one 
why why push it I mean it's just like trying to

25:50.600 --> 25:57.390
create a little controversy and I mean and and and 
treatment sometimes of subordinates is not and

25:57.610 --> 26:06.910
and I mean here people all across it don't do that 
right but I've I've had a little problems in that

26:06.890 --> 26:12.190
area do these Chinese students by and large pass 
the word on to fellow countrymen to come here how do

26:21.610 --> 26:28.270
how do those particular students happen to come 
here what connection is there between A&M and

26:28.490 --> 26:32.709
Well, Askell, I think they may email 200 people. 
They'll email every name they can possibly get as a

26:33.171 --> 26:37.510
place to go. I'm not sure how many we've had come 
here because they know something about Texas A&M

26:37.490 --> 26:45.510
specifically. Now, it is true that any number of 
our faculty visited in China. So, you know, there

26:50.490 --> 26:55.510
are, and I know, well, Larry Wildings had one or two 
students come work with him, where the contact was

26:55.490 --> 26:57.829
established. I know it was established in China. 
But in many cases, I get anywhere from three to six

27:00.490 --> 27:11.510
inquiries a day where I have a feeling that email 
went to 200. But is it primarily a communication

27:11.490 --> 27:18.510
from a Chinese student that's here back to them? 
That I don't know. I was wondering, it's not a

27:19.490 --> 27:22.510
faculty member from here to there. No, I don't 
think so. No. Could be. I mean, there are exchanges

27:25.995 --> 27:32.110
going on all the time, so some of that could be 
occurring I'm not aware of. I mean, more like

27:32.090 --> 27:38.110
Larry's, he's had at least two students come just 
because of the contact. But I'll tell you what I've

27:38.090 --> 27:42.360
actually seen. Through this door, right out here, 
this fall, at least 50 and maybe 75 students,

27:42.340 --> 27:55.700
mainly from India, maybe Pakistan, graduate 
students at Texas A&M, looking for

27:55.680 --> 27:59.700
assistantships. And they're in engineering or 
computer science. Engineering lost all those

28:03.860 --> 28:05.880
dollars. And they have been losing them. So they 
admit these students with no financial aid. Now a

28:11.860 --> 28:16.880
student has to prove, you know, they have to prove 
they can support themselves here before they let

28:11.860 --> 28:16.880
them come over here. But, you know, any 
enterprising student, they want to be

28:16.860 --> 28:22.880
self-supporting as soon as possible. So they're 
going out hustling the money. I've seen a one-page

28:24.860 --> 28:36.580
printout that is distributed in India telling 
students how to do it. Get admitted to Texas A&M. Go

28:38.560 --> 28:41.580
from department to department. Locate 
assistantships. And many of them get them, too.

28:47.210 --> 28:49.230
They actually line them up. But I'll bet we've had 
at least 75 come here. And Carol, the

28:53.210 --> 28:55.230
administrator. The administrative assistant 
next door. Go tell them there's nothing. They

28:59.210 --> 29:01.230
can't take that. If my door's open, they'll be over 
here. How many of these international students

29:03.560 --> 29:15.050
are getting assistantships or other kind of aid 
that otherwise would have gone to an American

29:03.560 --> 29:15.050
national? Very few. You can't find the American 
national anywhere close to the capabilities

29:15.956 --> 29:21.050
these kids have. All right. I mean, we're talking 
GREs, 14, 1500. Hopeful 630, 40. So no question

29:28.030 --> 29:32.050
about their intellectual ability. All right. I 
mean, they're superior. All right. We're about to

29:38.202 --> 29:39.760
finish this take. And you can't find that. You 
can't find that. Are American nationals getting

29:42.740 --> 29:53.960
hired right out of the undergraduate years now 
more than they used to? Is that one of the handicaps

29:53.940 --> 29:57.960
toward recruiting American national graduate 
students? Is that the corporations? Yeah, the job

29:59.940 --> 30:02.880
situations. Yeah, I think that's true. So private 
industry of all sorts? And our enrollment's low.

30:09.860 --> 30:17.880
Generally speaking, in the soil and plant areas, 
our enrollment is relatively low at the

30:09.860 --> 30:17.880
undergraduate level in relation to the Is that 
true nationally? Yeah. So that A&M is not unusual

30:19.931 --> 30:22.880
in the I mean, we compete. You get a domestic 
student that finishes any land grant

30:25.480 --> 30:29.850
institution. Any land grant institution. With a 
3.5, it can score 11 or 1200 on the GRE. They can

30:36.830 --> 30:39.850
literally go anywhere they want to go. I mean, 
we've had them in here. We had an Oklahoma State

30:41.830 --> 30:46.850
fellow in here and recruited him. I mean, it's hard 
if we try to recruit a faculty member. What kind of?

30:51.830 --> 30:53.850
What might y'all offer him? Well, our standard 
assistantship rate would be 16,000 this year.

30:59.490 --> 31:04.570
16,000 this year for a PhD and 14,000 for a 
master's. And there's even a little tuition pool

31:04.550 --> 31:08.570
that we can offer from now. And a few faculty will 
supplement even that out of something else. Is

31:13.550 --> 31:17.200
that competitive nationally as far as you know? I 
think so. It certainly is if you consider the

31:18.180 --> 31:21.200
health insurance benefit.
