00:03.203 --> 00:15.801
As far as you recall, about how much lead time 
warning did a young man get between the time he got

00:03.203 --> 00:15.801
his orders to report and the date he had to go? Okay, 
now what happened when we were sophomores, they

00:16.021 --> 00:29.380
came out in the fall, they said if you would join the 
AF Armed Forces Reserve, If you were joined that,

00:29.444 --> 00:35.791
you can stay in school until the end of your 
semester, end of sophomore year. So we actually

00:35.811 --> 00:39.475
were enrolled in the Army while we were at A&M. We 
weren't getting paid, but we were in the Army. With

00:42.018 --> 00:46.363
understanding, we could stay until June, I guess. 
So as soon as we were at school, we went straight to

00:46.383 --> 00:50.388
the Army. So that's June of 43. June of 43. I went to 
Camp Maxitex. All right. That sophomore year, did

00:56.675 --> 00:58.337
you have a car? Oh, no. And you're still living on a 
pretty... Yeah, oh, yeah. You mentioned a while

01:05.504 --> 01:09.007
ago you didn't have any civilian clothes your 
freshman year. No, we didn't. I had some, but they

01:11.290 --> 01:12.732
were in Stevensville. But you didn't bring any 
with you? No, no. So that even if you had decided you

01:14.734 --> 01:24.365
wanted to slip off and wear some civilian clothes 
you didn't have any... That's right. I was happy to

01:24.625 --> 01:27.328
wear that uniform. You didn't have anything that 
had to go to the dry cleaners. No. It was all

01:31.723 --> 01:32.844
washable, wasn't it? We had the laundry every 
week. And we'd wear our clothes sometimes six

01:35.047 --> 01:37.690
weeks after. It was dirty. Now, you sent them to the 
laundry. You didn't do them yourself. They picked

01:41.935 --> 01:42.596
them up. Did you wash your own socks and underwear? 
Mm-hmm. Where'd you get a haircut? Over at the core

01:49.163 --> 01:52.287
area right there. You know where the Trigon is? On 
the opposite corner, south corner there. Not

01:59.146 --> 02:00.448
south corner, the east corner. There was a little 
shopping area right in there. They had a

02:04.192 --> 02:10.800
barbershop, they had a little cafeteria type 
thing or drugstore, shoe shine place like that. We

02:10.840 --> 02:11.360
ate there. We got our haircuts there. I didn't go up 
North Vegas. And what kind of razor did you guys

02:15.105 --> 02:17.127
use? I've always used straight razor. I never used 
straight razor. Okay, I was wondering. I think my

02:22.903 --> 02:30.049
father maybe did, but they must have come out in the 
30s because I never shaved with anything with

02:22.903 --> 02:30.049
straight razor. Let's see, was Leupold around 
those days? I do not remember because I didn't go to

02:32.692 --> 02:34.874
Northgate. Okay. How often did you go to Bryan? 
Never. Never? I never went to Bryan all the time I

02:40.799 --> 02:45.624
was here until after I came back after the war. 
Okay, we mentioned... wartime events. We

02:48.274 --> 02:49.876
mentioned Pearl Harbor. What other events do you 
remember before you went on active duty that made

02:50.617 --> 02:56.643
an impression? Bataan, Corregidor? Names. We 
didn't have the news. We didn't have theaters. We

03:03.851 --> 03:06.074
didn't get the news in those days. You might have 
heard it on radio, but I don't recall. It didn't

03:10.238 --> 03:12.281
make an impression. So you don't go out for spring 
training then your sophomore year? I went spring

03:15.985 --> 03:17.286
training sophomore year. knowing you're not 
going to be here that far. That's correct. And

03:20.299 --> 03:23.583
Norton told us there, and that's one thing I've 
always loved him for. He knew we was going.

03:25.226 --> 03:26.287
Everybody knew we was going. He said, I guarantee 
you guys, you'll have a scholarship when you come

03:26.367 --> 03:30.312
back. And that cost him his job later. I have heard 
that. That got him fired. He couldn't recruit

03:34.978 --> 03:38.722
young guys, so he's going 25, 26. He's been gone 
three years, and we couldn't cut it. But he let us

03:42.347 --> 03:45.290
come back and finish our education. Let's see. 
What were the most... in those years, what were the

03:47.185 --> 03:50.590
most popular student indulgences? On campus? 
Drownouts?

03:58.642 --> 04:01.546
I never saw this, but they used to unload the 
trains. They had what they called Fish Day. I think

04:04.751 --> 04:06.473
that's what they called it. And that day the 
freshmen could get away with murder. They could do

04:09.537 --> 04:10.599
anything. And sometimes they told me that they'd 
go up here and stop the trains and unloaded

04:15.316 --> 04:17.539
whatever they had on them. I didn't see that, but I 
didn't get... I don't remember any great... That

04:20.403 --> 04:27.312
was the first one. Oh, the steam tunnels. You know 
about steam tunnels. Tell me about steam tunnels.

04:31.418 --> 04:33.320
I never got in one, but I know what they did. Well, 
now, nobody admits having been in them. I never

04:35.924 --> 04:36.605
went in them. I wouldn't know one, but they tell 
me... Lewis Buck. Let me tell you about Lewis Buck.

04:43.852 --> 04:44.813
What's the last name? Buck. He was a freshman 
football player. Big guy, 220, 230. We had a corps

04:50.721 --> 04:56.228
commander, and I do not remember his name, but 
Louis Buck beat him up. When he was gone, they beat

04:56.248 --> 04:57.871
the hell out of him. And I don't know if he went 
through the steam tunnel or not, but the senior

04:59.393 --> 05:05.200
corps, now the senior corps ran any of those 
things. We didn't have commandants and all that

05:05.360 --> 05:07.463
stuff. The seniors ran the college, I guarantee 
you. They packed his stuff and put him on the train

05:12.016 --> 05:17.383
and told him never to come back on this campus. 
Ever. Well, of course, the war came. He went to war,

05:21.068 --> 05:24.893
and he did come back and got a veterinary degree. 
And he's a classmate of mine, class 45. His sister

05:26.816 --> 05:34.206
was on one of the 10 most wanted criminals on the FBI 
list. Well, Buck came back. and got his degree, and

05:36.805 --> 05:40.771
then he got into, you know Les Palmer? Sure. He was 
Les Palmer's roommate. Oh, okay. We had our 50th

05:44.277 --> 05:52.791
reunion, and we had a meeting over at the motel, and 
the president came out and talked, and Buck would

05:44.277 --> 05:52.791
sit back, and he was so rude. He was the rudest 
person I ever saw. And then he went on up here to

05:56.136 --> 06:01.885
Franklin and died, but he's the guy that beat up 
this poor guy who was, He came here from NTAC, North

06:02.101 --> 06:07.229
Texas.

06:08.271 --> 06:10.314
But I never got in those things. I wasn't going to 
get down in that hole. Let's see, were you aware of

06:14.160 --> 06:17.325
any secret fraternities? Yeah, I've heard they 
were. I heard there's something called Sons of

06:19.408 --> 06:24.196
Texas or True Texans. There's one called... What 
was that other one? They've been here forever. But

06:30.056 --> 06:33.043
you weren't aware of who they were? Not when I was in 
school. I never heard of them. No, I just heard of

06:35.028 --> 06:37.855
those after I came back working here. I don't 
remember what they are. Let's see. Was there

06:40.502 --> 06:42.547
silver taps in those days? Yes, but I never went. I 
went to Silver Taps after I came back here, and I've

06:44.356 --> 06:50.102
only been one time. And let's see, and you didn't go 
to Final Review before you went away to the

06:50.122 --> 06:54.967
service? No. Okay. All right, you came back then 
when? Came back in January 1946. All right, so the

07:02.755 --> 07:11.483
war was over in August of 45, and you're here in 
January. Had the campus changed? Yes, of course. A

07:16.571 --> 07:21.477
lot more people here, more civilians here, more 
girls here, wives. So that big growth was already

07:21.998 --> 07:25.523
there in January? Yes, I think so. And the women, 
there was lots of women. Of course, they couldn't

07:28.046 --> 07:29.828
go yet. A lot of guys like I was were married and 
children on campus. All right. I have assumed that

07:35.595 --> 07:42.544
the typical student then was much more 
determined, much more goal-oriented. Much less

07:42.794 --> 07:47.719
playing around then. Oh yeah, definitely. People 
are more mature. Not much monkey business. People

07:51.582 --> 07:52.323
wanted to get out. They'd lost three years. So you 
lived over, pretty soon you're over in College

07:53.724 --> 07:57.468
View. Yeah. And what did the wives do? Well, I don't 
know. But they had their own little group. Some of

08:07.418 --> 08:08.078
them worked. My wife didn't work. She had a little 
boy. And what kind of activities were there for the

08:12.848 --> 08:17.914
pre-first graders? There was nothing like that. 
There wasn't daycare? They hung around that area

08:22.959 --> 08:28.445
and visited with young friends there at that time. 
So we would go to school. Well, I would go to school

08:29.606 --> 08:31.669
at 8 o'clock in the morning. I wouldn't get home 
until 8 o'clock at night. Now you're playing, did

08:34.231 --> 08:36.173
you play ball? Yeah, played two more years. And so 
you're going through two-a-days. Yeah. And let's

08:42.937 --> 08:46.241
see, is Coach Norton still? Coach Norton's still 
here. He went out when I went out, and Harry Stiler

08:47.683 --> 08:50.627
came in. How many of your classmates, how many of 
those, in general, how many of those pre-World War

08:50.667 --> 09:02.542
II scholarship recipients came back? Well, I've 
thought about that, Haskell. I don't think that

09:04.965 --> 09:09.731
more than 10 of us ever graduated out of that 100 and 
something came here. I could be. Well, but not of

09:11.113 --> 09:12.775
that 100. But those that were here in 42. Came back? 
Uh-huh. Let me look here a minute. Okay. Came back.

09:22.805 --> 09:23.806
Fulberg did. He didn't. He didn't. That's Bill 
Sabian. He didn't. McCann didn't. He didn't.

09:31.135 --> 09:31.876
Henderson didn't. Cure didn't. Montgomery 
didn't. Cullen didn't. Zappalack didn't. Leo

09:37.063 --> 09:37.784
did. Jake Webster. Williams. He did. He did. These 
were here before. Damon Tassus, Jennings

09:45.510 --> 09:50.557
Anderson, Vernon Valville. I'd say about half of 
that bunch. Okay, about half. And I'm assuming

09:56.767 --> 10:01.473
that all of you were better students. Definitely. 
Because you were more mature. Your goals were more

10:04.618 --> 10:07.522
clear. You had greater responsibilities. Did the 
faculty seem to understand that? I don't know that

10:15.428 --> 10:19.632
I never had any problem with faculty people. They 
were always very generous to me. Was the faculty

10:22.475 --> 10:28.880
that you remembered, were many of them still here? 
A few. The main guy I can remember is Dan Russell. He

10:32.904 --> 10:33.965
was really a great guy. He helped students. Of 
course, a lot of faculty people have been off to

10:35.226 --> 10:37.689
war, too. There wasn't that much difference in our 
ages, too much. And let's see, then after the war,

10:45.128 --> 10:48.493
Do you remember any musters or those things? No, I 
don't ever think I... We didn't have muster on the

10:48.553 --> 10:51.717
campus. I don't think it started there yet. All 
right, when you graduated, where was

10:55.583 --> 10:58.327
commencement held? Dine. Do you remember who the 
speaker was? No, I didn't go because I graduated

11:03.454 --> 11:05.297
midterms. And there was no commencement? There 
was no commencement. Okay. And you stayed here?

11:12.017 --> 11:12.277
Here. Never left the campus. Okay. So you didn't do 
a final review. No, I wasn't in the Corps. Oh. When I

11:20.424 --> 11:23.667
came back after the war, I was enlisted during the 
war. Okay, so you dropped. I was a staff sergeant

11:25.229 --> 11:28.872
first class, which is two stripes. And I wanted to 
get back in the Corps and get my commission. But I

11:30.974 --> 11:35.638
heard that after I got in college, they said if you 
leave here, you won't have an apartment, so I

11:35.939 --> 11:38.281
couldn't go to summer camp. So I said, okay. So I 
went ahead and got a commission and had a deal then

11:39.643 --> 11:44.908
for your first three graders, then you could get 
commission, which I did. And I got in the guard in

11:45.348 --> 11:48.111
those days. Let's see. Bonfire. Was there a 
bonfire held? I don't remember one. I've seen

11:53.116 --> 11:54.097
pictures of it. It was a bunch of little trashy 
boxes. You don't even remember where it was? The

12:00.443 --> 12:03.546
first one I remember is over in front of the MSC. 
Now, you're not wearing an Aggie ring. Yeah, I am.

12:05.740 --> 12:07.042
Oh, I'm sorry. And why is an Aggie ring important? I 
don't know. I think it just binds guys. As you know,

12:15.676 --> 12:19.723
the first place I look, anywhere I go, I look at 
their fingers. And I have run across Aggies

12:19.743 --> 12:22.427
everywhere just because of that ring. I think it's 
just something with... I came to A&M for a lot of

12:24.230 --> 12:25.713
reasons. One was the boots and one for the ring. I 
didn't get the boots because I didn't get the...

12:27.496 --> 12:32.524
See, my class, we never had a corps commander. We 
never had a senior yell leader. We never had a class

12:34.630 --> 12:36.352
president. We didn't have any of that because we 
were gone when our time came. So we're kind of a

12:40.218 --> 12:42.621
different class than most of them. Class 45. How 
many other classes would that be? None, none of

12:46.286 --> 12:47.027
them. Would the class of 44, though? I don't think 
so. Class 44, wouldn't some of them, wouldn't a

12:51.934 --> 12:57.882
large number of them have gone? Yeah, I'm sure they 
would. But 45, certainly. But we didn't have any of

13:01.427 --> 13:02.629
that. What

13:03.014 --> 13:08.640
makes Aggie Spirit what it is? Well, the best I can 
say is

13:11.303 --> 13:24.277
I read the other day, he says, from within, you 
can't describe it without you can't understand

13:11.303 --> 13:24.277
it. That's all I mean. Are there any events that 
help? Athletic, definitely. Okay, but what else?

13:33.447 --> 13:37.373
Well, if someone participates in civil tax, it 
does. If you go to Smuster, it does. Any of the

13:39.196 --> 13:42.721
things, the big things on the campus that do.

13:44.824 --> 13:46.667
Friendship, binding together. It's hard. Now, 
like these two kids of hers, And her two sons, I just

13:50.382 --> 13:54.788
feel so much closer to them because they're 
Aggies. Aggies can do no wrong. And I know that's

13:56.331 --> 13:59.135
wrong because some of them here I wouldn't have in 
my house. But Mr. Penberthy used to say, these old

13:59.936 --> 14:07.126
guys came back here and they liked to talk about how 
it was in their day. He says what they meant, they

14:07.146 --> 14:10.912
liked to talk about how they thought it was in their 
day. So that's probably what I'm thinking. You

14:13.576 --> 14:15.519
remember the good part. I think these events... 
that are comparatively inclusive. Nobody checks

14:21.959 --> 14:27.108
your grade point ratio or anything before you walk 
in. I think for some, fish camp helps to start them

14:28.009 --> 14:34.620
along that road now. Even

14:35.541 --> 14:45.617
today, as crowded as it is, I think those 
activities are still inclusive. Well, let's see.

14:47.352 --> 14:49.375
I'm just about to finish. What did it mean to you in 
terms of your life that you came to Texas A&M? Well,

14:58.505 --> 15:00.467
I don't know. I don't know anything else. This has 
been my home for 67 years. I think I was very

15:05.793 --> 15:08.276
fortunate to get to come here. I was very fortunate 
I went to war and came back. I was very fortunate

15:11.379 --> 15:12.280
that But all the things that, like my first job 
here, all the friends I've made, the places I've

15:12.749 --> 15:21.378
been able to go, my children growing up here, 
although none of my children are Aggies. I didn't

15:22.559 --> 15:24.321
go to school with them. But I don't know. It's just I 
couldn't think of being from anywhere else.

15:29.986 --> 15:32.709
Again, it's hard for me to describe that. It's 
awfully hard. All right, let's make believe

15:33.210 --> 15:40.697
somebody gave you a million-dollar check that you 
had to give to A&M. but you can decide what it's

15:41.555 --> 15:44.798
going to go for. What would you have it? It wouldn't 
go athletic. What parts of the institution are

15:50.384 --> 15:53.687
dearest to you?

15:58.792 --> 16:01.194
Well, I've thought about it. If I ever won the 
lottery, I would give 10%. I don't know if I

16:03.016 --> 16:05.399
wouldn't do it to the church. And I got to thinking, 
how am I going to do it to the church? So what do I

16:07.641 --> 16:08.862
think I'd do? I'd give it to somebody in charge and 
say, you know more than I do where your needs are.

16:15.318 --> 16:17.360
That's about all I could come up with. Are there 
any, if all of the Aggies that you've ever

16:17.981 --> 16:31.795
encountered

16:17.981 --> 16:31.795
were available, which Aggies would you want to 
thank most? Darius Moser, Paul Bernard, Ben

16:31.815 --> 16:38.543
McCollum, the man we haven't even talked about. 
What did he do? He was a man in Stephenville that was

16:39.588 --> 16:42.752
a banker. He had both legs cut off here. His son was 
an Aggie, a veterinarian, and he encouraged me to

16:45.536 --> 16:52.064
come here. And a guy named Harry Breyer, who was 
also an Aggie in Stephenville, he encouraged me to

16:52.185 --> 16:56.130
come here. Because I was searching where I wanted 
to go to school at that time. I could have gone back

17:00.175 --> 17:02.338
wherever I wanted to at that time. And neither one 
of you gave you any financial inducement? No, no,

17:05.926 --> 17:10.170
no.

17:11.652 --> 17:20.241
Is there anybody that you, if they were available, 
that you'd want to invite to come over and sit near

17:11.652 --> 17:20.241
you to enjoy a good life? Some Aggie coming? Yeah. 
Spike White. He's a best friend of mine. I can tell

17:29.110 --> 17:31.853
in your voice while I go how you... You know Bob? You 
know his son? He's a dentist. Oh, yeah. Yeah, he's

17:35.648 --> 17:36.830
our dentist. Okay. Well, see, I raised Bob. You're 
talking about this fish camp. Tim Burton is

17:41.596 --> 17:42.917
responsible for that. Mr. Gay, Garden Gay, you 
know what that means? Oh, yes. Garden Gay and Spike

17:46.422 --> 17:55.393
White and a guy named Napoleon, a black man who 
worked a while, and I took the first fish camp. Up to

17:56.065 --> 17:59.009
Mahea. Mahea. Mahea. We went there for years. I 
went straight for 20-some odd years fishing

18:01.292 --> 18:03.696
there. Oh, and not the one at Palestine. No, no, it 
was later. Palestine wasn't even there yet. Where

18:08.582 --> 18:09.584
near Mahea? Oh, at Fort, what's that Fort Mahea 
following? Oh, oh, oh. Fort Parker. Fort Parker.

18:15.592 --> 18:16.353
We went to Fort Parker. Yes. We had about 25 boys. 
Now, when was that? Early 50s. Now, this was a fish

18:22.362 --> 18:23.423
camp. We drove up there in a school bus. How long did 
it last? Two or three days? About three days. And

18:30.780 --> 18:33.023
what were the primary emphases? Well, like they do 
today, I guess. We took these kids up there. They

18:36.889 --> 18:37.951
got to know one another. We brought corps 
commanders in the upper class. We brought faculty

18:40.055 --> 18:41.637
up there. Student leaders up there and talked to 
the kids and helped them understand. Get Yale

18:45.023 --> 18:46.044
leaders to come up. They liked to do that. Whose 
idea was it? And Gordon Gates. Where did they get

18:50.555 --> 18:51.496
that? I don't know, but it never happened before. 
They didn't come? I don't know of any other school.

18:55.319 --> 19:00.845
I don't know about that, but we went up there, and I 
remember I went until 1972, I guess. In 1961,

19:02.887 --> 19:05.769
remember Carla? Mm-hmm. Remember Carla? We were 
there then, and we had to leave early. We had to rush

19:08.332 --> 19:12.275
home because we were afraid they were going to call 
us. Because I've always thought that what fish

19:12.295 --> 19:20.443
camp does is to immerse everybody in maroon when 
they get to the campus as freshmen. Gives them lots

19:20.879 --> 19:23.523
of information they need. And again, it's one of 
those binding. That's right. Well, you live with

19:26.767 --> 19:27.969
people. It doesn't take three or four days. It's 
like, okay, so you came to Stephenville and I came

19:29.611 --> 19:32.735
to Myron as well. So what? Come on, we're in the same 
dorm, same... So, last question. What feelings do

19:38.423 --> 19:43.449
you hold in your heart for any of them?

19:44.651 --> 19:46.954
I don't hold the feelings I had for my other 
friends. I love A&M, what it does, but there's so

19:48.166 --> 19:52.411
many things I don't like. I don't like 
homosexuals. I don't like lesbians. I don't like

19:57.036 --> 20:02.061
people coming in here and desecrating the campus. 
I don't like people coming in here that never go to

20:02.081 --> 20:05.385
anything yet. They want to go out and live on the 
traditions and the morals of A&M that other people

20:05.445 --> 20:10.170
have done. They go out and say, I'm an Aggie. I think 
this very strongly. There's Aggies and there's

20:14.812 --> 20:19.578
students at Texas A&M, and I think there's a hell of 
a lot of difference. And I think we're getting more

20:19.598 --> 20:22.642
and more students at Texas A&M to do Aggies. I used 
to think only Aggies were poor, but I don't do that

20:22.662 --> 20:25.466
anymore. But we've got a lot of guys here. They're 
not Aggies. They're just students passing

20:28.089 --> 20:31.894
through here, and I don't like that. Because the 
people they're going out, they're representing

20:31.914 --> 20:35.419
A&M to other people. I said, gosh, that's a great 
Aggie. They're not even fair Aggies. And I think

20:39.845 --> 20:41.166
it's getting worse and worse. Like you said, we're 
too big. We've lost touch. I don't have the

20:47.058 --> 20:48.243
feeling. I don't know if I'd come to him today.
