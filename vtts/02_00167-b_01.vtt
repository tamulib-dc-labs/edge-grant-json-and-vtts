WEBVTT

00:02.900 --> 00:04.222
talking about outhouses. Yeah. And you said that 
the university would replace them. That's right,

00:08.609 --> 00:11.633
rebuild them and all that. I don't know. They may 
have taken them out there. I just don't know. But

00:15.639 --> 00:23.851
the bonfire, as you know it now, was originally 
held on the drill field. But when they made the

00:25.113 --> 00:28.198
movie, we've never been licked.

00:32.870 --> 00:35.674
They helped build that. They bought the center 
pole. They bought a whole bunch of poles and put on

00:38.217 --> 00:46.208
there, and we carried other stuff to make it up. And 
a bonfire was held there, and Bill Stern, the NBC

00:46.529 --> 01:00.908
sports announcer, covered that bonfire because 
the Thanksgiving Day game was going to be, it

00:46.529 --> 01:00.908
wasn't on TV, I guess. I guess it was on radio, but 
because they didn't have TV. Were you here when

01:05.583 --> 01:07.485
that movie was made? Yes. Describe any of your 
recollection of that, please. Well, I was in two

01:12.170 --> 01:16.676
scenes in it. Barton was marching into Savisa 
Hall, and the lead guy, I've forgotten his name, he

01:17.777 --> 01:30.291
was supposed to be in that outfit, and somebody was 
supposed to trip him. We were supposed to walk over

01:30.351 --> 01:31.733
him. and it was a stuntman, and we didn't step on the 
guy, you know, and they made us redo that until we'd

01:32.337 --> 01:39.593
step on him. Then they had a scene in Sbisa, a dance, 
where there was supposed to be a fight, and we were

01:40.755 --> 01:51.679
in, I was in one of the crowd in there, And the thing I 
remember most about that, of course, was we never

01:52.385 --> 01:57.252
really ever had a fight in the dance hall. And we all 
had to take off our shoes so we wouldn't make noise

01:57.272 --> 02:02.960
because they were recording it. And I don't know. 
How long were those movie people around? Do you

02:09.629 --> 02:10.089
remember? They were here for a pretty good while. 
Was it months or weeks? Months. There was more than

02:16.358 --> 02:17.560
a month. And I presume that y'all were pretty 
excited about Well, everybody, of course, wanted

02:21.967 --> 02:26.153
to meet the two gals. And Gail, the cadet 
commander, was the escort of one of them at one of

02:27.235 --> 02:37.510
the ball games, and got on there. Martha 
O'Driscoll, and she was a blonde. I can't think of

02:43.398 --> 02:44.820
the other. That brown-headed gal's name. I know. 
We were all— about seeing them out at Franklin's

02:49.861 --> 02:53.225
and what have you. Did you get to see the movie soon 
after it was made? Or were you gone by then? I think

02:59.812 --> 03:00.893
we were gone. I don't think I saw it until after I 
came back. I was in the service because, no, that's

03:05.619 --> 03:10.384
another thing. No, it was after I came back. Now, 
you may have seen it. I don't know. You probably

03:16.220 --> 03:23.032
weren't on campus at this time, but where were you 
when you heard the news of D-Day?

03:28.040 --> 03:29.983
You were at Fort Benning, Georgia. Not D-Day, 
V-E-D. No, D-Day. D-Day, I had just started OCS in

03:35.773 --> 03:42.244
Fort Benning, Georgia. In fact, I've got the 
graduation program for that, and it started

03:43.203 --> 03:49.091
December 7, 1944.

03:51.575 --> 03:53.497
June, not June 7. June 7. Right. Not June 7. Then 
another important memory. Where were you when you

04:01.168 --> 04:04.433
heard the news that President Roosevelt had died? 
Most of us. Camp Shelby, Mississippi. Camp Shelby

04:10.118 --> 04:12.180
is where we were when that happened. We all 
wondered what was going to happen and how Harry was

04:12.200 --> 04:17.807
going to take over, you know. Because you're a 
little older than I, but most of us didn't remember

04:18.728 --> 04:32.143
any president before Roosevelt, and we didn't 
know who the vice president was very much. Let's

04:34.005 --> 04:34.445
see. All right, you come back to the campus when? 
After the war? No, but when did you get back? I came

04:42.509 --> 04:46.434
back, landed, I guess it was in, was it 45? Did I 
start over here? You came back in 46. I guess it was

04:51.179 --> 04:52.361
46. I landed on Juneteenth in San Francisco, and we 
got on a troop train, and they started down here,

04:53.222 --> 05:06.737
and they took us to Fort Sam Houston. I had called 
Dolores from San Francisco. We spent one night in

05:09.128 --> 05:15.996
San Francisco and told her I was going to be in San 
Houston at San Antonio. But I wasn't sure just what

05:16.797 --> 05:18.299
day. I said, it's going to take us probably two days 
to get there on a train. And the minute we came into

05:22.343 --> 05:26.808
Texas, the Texans began to bail off of that train. 
But not a one of them missed. When the train got to

05:29.791 --> 05:34.076
San Antonio, they were all there waiting for us. 
Anyway, I got a hold of her and And then I came back to

05:37.649 --> 05:44.179
A&M, I guess that September, didn't I? Because I 
drove back and forth from Brenham for a while.

05:48.626 --> 05:57.819
Couldn't find a place to live over here, so we drove 
back and forth, and that was before you could, you

05:48.626 --> 05:57.819
know, the road wasn't paved coming through the 
bottom. That's when you came through Navasota and

05:57.840 --> 06:00.924
all. About how long a drive did it, in time, did it 
take? Well, we were out a little over an hour. Now,

06:08.576 --> 06:16.168
if we could go through the bottom, it was a terrible 
road, and you could cut off a little bit of mileage,

06:08.576 --> 06:16.168
not much time. What was your, you and your fellow 
veterans, how did your attitude about classwork

06:17.350 --> 06:30.370
change when you came back?

06:32.797 --> 06:35.742
Of course, we were more serious about education. 
Now, some of the guys that came back had not been

06:36.643 --> 06:44.675
commissioned, and they wanted to get back in the 
Corps. And that was one of the few protests that I

06:44.695 --> 06:57.034
know that I participated in was when Gil Gilchrist 
was president. I don't even remember what the Sam

06:58.076 --> 07:00.660
Hilley did. But we didn't like it. And we were going 
to get him fired. We, the veterans. And we met in the

07:07.354 --> 07:12.442
old assembly hall, and we got a couple of guys from 
the state legislature to come over. And that

07:13.444 --> 07:16.629
assembly hall was packed, and people were on the 
outside. I couldn't get in. I was on the outside

07:17.471 --> 07:19.534
looking in. And bless their heart, the guys that 
were leading the veterans, those politicians

07:24.316 --> 07:29.262
turned them inside out. I mean, not inside out, but 
they had them spun so anyway, that was the end of it,

07:29.443 --> 07:36.131
yeah. Now, you were not in the Corps. No, not then. 
Because you had been commissioned. Right. And

07:43.921 --> 07:47.165
then, do you all finally locate a place to live over 
here? Yeah. Brian Field closed. And got housing by

07:54.573 --> 07:57.717
points, how long you've been in the service. 
That's right. And I finally, they finally had some

07:58.699 --> 08:04.727
quarters out there that we could move into. They 
were tar paper shacks. You heard them talk about

08:08.512 --> 08:16.183
the annex, but anyway, we had two rooms and a long 
hall. I mean, two bedrooms, but the, except for us

08:16.423 --> 08:24.394
and the other apartments, the walls didn't go all 
the way to the ceiling or to the floor. and a gas

08:26.990 --> 08:30.516
burner in there with an oven on it. My dad got one of 
the men that worked for the company to bring out a

08:30.957 --> 08:48.546
few things over here in the truck, and we pulled up 
in front of that tar paper shack, and the man that

08:30.957 --> 08:48.546
was driving it and was helping us, he said, does 
your dad know that you're moving into this? No. But

08:51.492 --> 08:55.537
I breezed in there, and there was no kitchen, and 
there was no bathroom. And I said, Perry, where is

08:55.597 --> 08:57.719
the bathroom? And he said, well, it's just right 
down this sidewalk here, and it's called a

08:57.800 --> 09:03.146
lottery. We were there two weeks, moved into 
College View. Yeah. All right, was College View

09:07.932 --> 09:10.875
filled with veterans? Yes. And it was, at that 
time, it was filled with veterans. And they had gas

09:17.935 --> 09:27.265
burners, but they did have a sink that hung on the 
wall, and they had ice boxes. And they had one bed

09:28.526 --> 09:35.754
that was kind of like a double bed, and then they had 
a cot.

09:35.794 --> 09:41.079
Well, when we first moved in, we rented it, and then 
we began to get some, and I could get it. And if you

09:41.540 --> 09:46.305
had it unrented... $24 a month. $24 a month. How 
adequate was the GI Bill to help pay your expenses?

09:54.761 --> 09:59.347
Well, of course, I think they get $90 a month. But 
they paid everything at A&M. My books, drafting

10:03.572 --> 10:08.578
equipment, slide rules, anything we needed. And 
I'm sure the profs had us buying books maybe that we

10:09.279 --> 10:13.864
didn't need. I don't know. we just signed a voucher 
and the government took care of that and they paid

10:15.732 --> 10:42.533
us $90 a month and and so what they paid for the rent 
and what little we could make I couldn't I worked

10:15.732 --> 10:42.533
some but they didn't work a whole lot because there 
just weren't too many there's so many people

10:15.732 --> 10:42.533
looking for jobs there weren't a lot around uh and 
Dolores was a very sharp shopper and uh And they'd

10:45.027 --> 11:00.429
come, some of the older, other vets would be very 
enterprising, and they'd come through the place

10:45.027 --> 11:00.429
with a pool cart selling vegetables and eggs, you 
know, and a lot cheaper than you could buy. We

11:00.449 --> 11:06.297
finally decided we'd make us a commissary in a 
garage, and it worked pretty good for a while. So

11:06.958 --> 11:08.520
what it was was a... A bulk buying association? 
That's right, it was a mutual aid. If I were to look

11:16.131 --> 11:25.146
at your transcript after the war grades compared 
to before the war grades, would I see any

11:16.131 --> 11:25.146
difference? Yeah. You were a better student after 
the war? Yeah. Were you and your veteran friends

11:33.087 --> 11:41.879
aware that any of the faculty may have changed the 
way they did things with these veterans in class?

11:43.781 --> 11:46.065
Because you were as old as some of the teachers, 
weren't you? No, I never had a graduate assistant

11:46.365 --> 11:50.551
teaching. I

11:51.652 --> 11:59.803
wasn't aware, and some of them may have been that 
got there, but

12:01.657 --> 12:08.543
All of my teachers, professors, I never had a 
graduate student. Al Chalk and all these others.

12:11.186 --> 12:21.495
Of course, I've already mentioned a bunch of them 
that we had, but I just don't remember a graduate

12:11.186 --> 12:21.495
student. Did you, as a veteran and his wife, did you 
all go to many student activities during those

12:21.515 --> 12:31.444
post-war years? Well, when she was married, after 
we were married, they had a free movie at Grove, and

12:32.403 --> 12:42.556
they had dances at Grove. We went to that several 
times. Of course, you may remember I had a son and a

12:44.179 --> 12:49.165
baby on the way.

12:53.230 --> 12:56.615
So you were busy pretty well all the time. Did you go 
to Silver Taps after the war? I was wondering if it

13:04.347 --> 13:06.650
may have had a different meaning. We had silver 
taps, but the RVs were not involved in it. And

13:15.961 --> 13:20.968
everybody shut down the lights and pulled the 
blinds. And the outfit the guy lived in walked down

13:21.609 --> 13:33.223
and stood as a formation by Sully, and the buglers 
blew silver taps.

13:33.558 --> 13:37.605
Let's see now, after the war, didn't Eisenhower 
make a famous visit here? Yes. Do you remember

13:38.927 --> 13:39.889
that? Or was that, were you gone before he got here? 
No. I think I was still here because I remember him

13:46.200 --> 13:51.870
coming in the main gate, that's out on the east on 
the East Gate, as you call, and he was escorted by

13:52.222 --> 14:01.512
the cavalry, the vehicle was, and they were 
carrying, they were mounted and they had lances.

14:02.313 --> 14:04.736
They pretty soon did away with the cavalry, too. 
But I think, I remember he made a, and he talked, I

14:05.256 --> 14:13.545
think Eisenhower was here twice, maybe just once. 
Right, you graduate when? I graduated in August of

14:16.876 --> 14:20.060
1947.

14:24.446 --> 14:25.848
Was there a commencement then? No. So did you ever 
go across the stage and officially? I got two

14:30.475 --> 14:37.384
degrees from A&M, a bachelor and a master's, and I 
never ever participated in a ceremony here. I

14:37.825 --> 14:43.052
participated in a military school graduation, 
but not here. All right, let's see. You didn't do a

14:44.048 --> 14:45.410
final review. I did a final review. When? This was 
when they took the class of 44 and 45 in at the same

14:47.974 --> 14:52.320
time. Describe it. Well, the final review then was 
a lot different than it is now. We farmed up just as

15:00.813 --> 15:05.399
they used to still do, except it was on the drill 
field. And we marched around, and the seniors led

15:06.741 --> 15:12.870
us. We came right back around and we reformed. We 
didn't break and go to the dormitory and change

15:17.093 --> 15:20.697
clothes or anything else. The only thing was you 
turned around and the fish got to drop their

15:20.717 --> 15:25.162
handle. And then the seniors formed a line and 
moved across. Then as now, the juniors, of course

15:30.869 --> 15:39.058
they were still wearing stripes and they took them 
around. But they were all, almost all of them were

15:43.377 --> 15:46.300
book privates in the Army, because that's what we 
were wearing then. And they took them around, and

15:47.000 --> 15:58.170
then they came across in the class of 46 with their 
little stragglers made the last one. I think it

15:59.351 --> 16:12.523
was, I don't remember whether it was raining or had 
rained, but it was, it was, that was very memorable

15:59.351 --> 16:12.523
and very emotional for all of us, because we knew we 
were leaving right after that. When you graduate,

16:13.128 --> 16:21.118
what's your first employment after? Teaching 
school in Brenham. How well prepared did you feel

16:24.482 --> 16:31.050
A&M had made you for that first task? I thought I was 
pretty well prepared. Of course, I taught

16:34.475 --> 16:52.580
mechanical drawing and shop, and I had another one 
I called broadening and finding, and then I taught

16:34.475 --> 16:52.580
general math, which was for the, at that time, the 
high school had five grades. They had eight, nine,

16:52.600 --> 16:55.404
10, 11, and 12. The ninth grade, if the kids weren't 
good enough to take algebra, They had general

17:02.234 --> 17:04.958
math, and I taught general math. He must have been 
equipped very, very well, because the students

17:05.418 --> 17:10.304
really thought he was good. Yeah. Right. So now 
when do you come back to A&M as a staff member? In

17:18.135 --> 17:19.536
March of 51. And what was your task? I'm sorry? What 
did you do? That's when I became a military

17:24.403 --> 17:27.447
counselor. Right. Describe that. I'm sorry? 
Describe that task. Well, I

17:31.647 --> 17:40.418
can't remember the colonel's name that was here at 
that time.

17:43.342 --> 17:44.403
It may have been Boatner. That was Boatner.

17:48.589 --> 17:59.983
Because they assigned me certain dorms to be, and 
since I was field artillery, I got a lot of the field

17:48.589 --> 17:59.983
artillery dormitories, also coast artillery 
dormitories. And my duties were to discipline the

18:01.162 --> 18:12.896
kids in the corps, to inspect their rooms or see 
that they were cleaned and in proper shape. And

18:12.916 --> 18:16.720
then I'd pull my regular duty every so often. 
They'd be there at night until midnight, which I

18:16.740 --> 18:30.696
would make two rounds, one right

18:16.740 --> 18:30.696
after CQ and the other one just after taps. And 
there were several comical incidents happened in

18:32.465 --> 18:36.991
that instance. And two of them I remember very 
vividly, and she remembers one of them very

18:37.913 --> 18:42.599
vividly. I was making my rounds, and I was over by 
dorm three, I guess it was. And I looked over, and

18:51.972 --> 18:57.640
there was a guy standing outside a window in dorm 
two and just laughing. And then pretty soon, he'd

18:58.220 --> 19:00.784
run inside. And then he'd come back, and he'd just 
laugh. And I got around over there, and I walked in.

19:08.400 --> 19:09.822
Water up to my ankles. And I said, where did all of 
this water come from? What water, sir? Well, then

19:17.454 --> 19:26.468
later on, on another incident, I walked by, and 
there's arm two to arm four, as I came by it out of the

19:17.454 --> 19:26.468
fourth floor. and my mattress, another mattress, 
the beds, the desk, and the chairs, and by now I'm on

19:28.034 --> 19:36.704
my way up to the fourth floor. Boy, I got up in a quick 
minute. The bull hit the fan, everybody knows it.

19:42.952 --> 19:44.153
Quiet as a church. I said, I got the first sergeant, 
and I said, what's going on here? He said, nothing,

19:51.863 --> 19:52.744
sir. And I said, who threw out the, trashed out this 
room? What room, sir? And I walked right down and

19:57.922 --> 20:00.424
said, open this damn door. And he opened it, and 
there were guys' clothes in there, and that was

20:01.085 --> 20:04.808
about it. I had them go back downstairs and pull all 
that stuff in them, back up to the room. While I'm

20:14.076 --> 20:24.505
doing that, one of the kids comes over and he says, 
Major Perry, your office is on fire. My office was

20:24.525 --> 20:26.627
over in dorm five. Well, I went over, my office 
wasn't on fire. But somebody had gone in there, and

20:31.143 --> 20:42.293
the only thing I could think of is they, somehow 
they set black shoe polish on fire. And this black

20:43.755 --> 20:48.059
smoke in the soot was all over that place. You 
couldn't put your hand anywhere. And I, oh boy, I

20:50.601 --> 20:54.505
was upset.

20:56.122 --> 21:07.435
I had to call Dolores and I said, well, I'll tell you 
what, I'm gonna be late coming in because somebody

20:56.122 --> 21:07.435
has really fixed my room up. I'm gonna find out who 
it is or my name is not Howard Perry. Well, about

21:13.142 --> 21:22.753
three o'clock in the morning, I guess, somewhere 
like that, I walk in and I quietly open the back

21:13.142 --> 21:22.753
door, tell him what you said. I said, hey, what's 
your name? And he said, oh, hell, John Doe. But when

21:29.120 --> 21:31.884
I got back to the office the next morning, it was all 
clean. So I don't know who did it. It may have

21:35.910 --> 21:41.217
been... Weldon Kruger was in school, and Perry had 
coached him in high school and taught him. And I

21:42.018 --> 21:44.221
think Weldon cleaned all that up. He may have had 
someone, because it took a lot to do it. Weldon was a

21:46.725 --> 21:47.826
good Brenham boy. Yeah. I got him to come to A&M. In 
fact, I was on a group that selected him as cadet

21:52.585 --> 22:00.857
colonel, but I didn't get to see him. I was gone 
before he became cadet colonel. Let's digress on

22:03.681 --> 22:04.703
that. As far as you know, what has been the 
comparative lifetime success rate of the key

22:06.826 --> 22:20.145
student leaders at A&M, corps commanders and so 
forth? Have they gone on to be successful? Most of

22:24.480 --> 22:43.588
them that I know have gone on, and a lot of people 
that were not prominent in their schoolwork, I

22:24.480 --> 22:43.588
mean, without they weren't high achievers or 
didn't have a lot of rank, were very successful in

22:24.480 --> 22:43.588
their other lives. And they all based it on their 
education at A&M, just like everybody does.

22:52.492 --> 23:02.410
There's only one guy that, and this was after I left 
the Corps, when I came back again, but that's

22:52.492 --> 23:02.410
another story. But it was a guy who was very 
prominent in the Corps, and he then became mayor of

23:02.430 --> 23:16.575
San Antonio, and got into trouble, and then fell on 
the cabinet.

23:18.007 --> 23:24.594
I think he was a colonel when he was here, Boatner, 
later became newsworthy in Korea. Describe him in

23:24.654 --> 23:27.938
personality and style. Okay. Colonel Boatner 
was, he was a true bull of the woods. He always said

23:35.226 --> 23:38.229
exactly what was on his mind. He moved from

23:46.542 --> 24:02.279
Military science people all moved down to

23:46.542 --> 24:02.279
Foster and anyway, the one there by Leggett, 
across the street from Leggett, not on the same

23:46.542 --> 24:02.279
side of the street from Leggett, Ross Hall. They 
tore Foster down. Ross Hall was standing. We

24:05.562 --> 24:12.229
called it the Pentagon, the small man's Pentagon.

24:14.133 --> 24:18.501
ran the place with an iron hand, and they had two 
little couple of things on him. They had two small

24:18.541 --> 24:34.470
cannons out in front, you know, and had a little 
grass they were trying to keep growing, and there

24:18.541 --> 24:34.470
was a freshman out there, and he was looking at one 
of these guns when Boatner walks up. He says,

24:35.783 --> 24:37.786
cadet, what are you doing? He said, I'm looking at 
this field artillery piece. And he said, what do

24:40.530 --> 24:41.731
you think of it? Oh, sir, I think the field 
artillery is the best branch of the service.

24:45.857 --> 24:46.819
Boatner was infantry. He said, well, get the hell 
off the grass. We always knew when somebody was

24:50.944 --> 25:02.601
going to catch it because he always raised the 
windows in his office. And what was the

25:02.935 --> 25:04.517
secretary's name? Marie, no, that guy in green, 
oh, golly. She was the secretary for the

25:13.690 --> 25:16.333
Commonwealth for a long time.

25:19.518 --> 25:21.681
Fern Adams called her Ms. Newley. Oh, you're 
talking

25:21.701 --> 25:27.108
about Jo. We'd see her leaving. Some of the others 
cleared out of that we knew. That he was going to

25:32.059 --> 25:33.621
chew somebody out. And he would use some very 
colorful language. Well, somewhere before I

25:36.866 --> 25:58.997
graduated, I mean, left A&M, working there, the 
seniors decided they were going to rebel, and so

25:36.866 --> 25:58.997
they said they were going to turn in their buttons, 
and they were going to march to the Pentagon and

25:59.197 --> 26:00.079
turn their buttons in. Boatner met them on the 
street. Halt! What do you all want? They said,

26:08.755 --> 26:11.621
we're going to resign from the Corps. He said, 
well, take your buttons off and I'll take them.

26:15.268 --> 26:21.660
Boy, they all looked at him, you know, and a couple 
walked up and he said, you're going to lose your

26:15.268 --> 26:21.660
contract, too. And boy, that broke the thing up 
right quick. I don't know what they were marching

26:24.947 --> 26:28.373
for, but they had some of them. He was very strong, 
and I think that's why they picked him to go to

26:28.393 --> 26:32.360
Korea. They made him a brigadier after he got 
there. So you were, in today's slang, you were a TAC

26:35.705 --> 26:40.954
officer. In today's slang, yeah. For how long? 
Well, from 51 to, when did I go to work? I went to work

26:48.527 --> 26:54.176
out at the National Guard Armory, I guess. I was 
there about four years. Four years. Were there

26:57.500 --> 26:58.242
any? Three and a half years. Who were the key campus 
administrators during that four years? Well,

27:03.449 --> 27:11.581
Benny Zinn was one of them, and Dean Brooks was the 
dean of the college. Joe David. Who? Joe Davis. He

27:15.689 --> 27:21.016
was assistant commandant and then actually 
became commandant for a while. That was after I

27:21.056 --> 27:22.698
left, I think. Who was president? Well, we had two 
presidents. One of them's name was Wayne, I think.

27:31.270 --> 27:31.991
That's not right. That's not right. Because 
Morgan wasn't here yet, was he? Morgan came in, I

27:36.905 --> 27:38.927
think, just before. He replaced another guy that 
replaced Gib Gilchrist. Okay, okay. I think

27:44.593 --> 27:45.574
Morgan was here. Yeah, I think Morgan was here, but 
there was somebody in between he and Gib

27:45.694 --> 27:50.399
Gilchrist. All right, so then you go to the armory, 
and then you come back to A&M when? I came back to A&M

27:56.486 --> 27:58.328
in 1963. What was your task then? I was a civilian 
counselor. Oh, I know a question I meant to ask.

28:05.557 --> 28:07.120
What was your compensation? What was your pay that 
first job when you came, what, in 51? Do you

28:12.810 --> 28:15.294
remember what that pay was? I don't remember in 51. 
I was teaching school. I started out at $200 a

28:25.364 --> 28:27.188
month. By the time I left over there, I was getting 
$240. That was before taxes. So you got a big, when

28:31.675 --> 28:34.580
you came over here at $400. That's the reason I 
came, yeah. All right, now you come back in 63. 63.

28:40.109 --> 28:41.392
And what's your task? I'm called a civilian 
counselor because we had a lot of civilians. You

28:45.959 --> 28:46.380
were a counselor. Yeah, civilian student 
counselor, because they had a lot of civilian

28:46.580 --> 28:50.524
students then. And what were, describe the duties 
of a civilian counselor. Well, they were similar

28:54.209 --> 28:58.714
to what they were as a TAC officer.

29:01.577 --> 29:05.621
We kept, we, you're dang right I checked them. I 
didn't have to, but their rooms were supposed to be

29:05.661 --> 29:08.925
clean. And all of us inspected the room. We didn't 
look in every room every day. And we supervised and

29:13.844 --> 29:18.570
hired the dorm daddies. And we kept personnel 
files on all of the kids in our dormitories. Now,

29:23.596 --> 29:30.945
when I first came back, I had Walton Hall and some of 
the new area, new, new area. And I kept, I kept,

29:36.800 --> 29:37.702
Records on that. So you're on board when the Corps 
becomes volunteer. Yes. How did that change? I'm

29:47.800 --> 29:48.141
sorry. It had already become volunteer when I got 
here. But the big growth in the number, I presume

29:51.307 --> 29:59.061
the civilian student body grew rapidly. Well, 
pretty rapidly. The core began to diminish a

30:01.010 --> 30:06.699
little bit because the kids that finished there 
were coming in. When it first became validated,

30:07.219 --> 30:12.787
the first two years were mandatory, then you could 
be a civilian. And I'm not sure of the dates on that.

30:17.314 --> 30:20.919
Yeah, the civilian population was pretty good. 
And civilian students were living where? Well,

30:24.344 --> 30:28.390
they lived in Hart Hall, they lived in Leggett, 
they lived in Mitchell. They lived in Milner, they

30:28.690 --> 30:39.041
lived in Walton Hall, and one of the dorms in the 
Nunu area, and the Corps had the rest of the place.

30:40.222 --> 30:43.706
And you civilian counselors reported to whom? 
Benny Zinn. Describe Mr. Zinn. Wonderful guy. He

30:48.851 --> 30:54.377
was even-tempered, he was white-headed, he was so 
friendly. To us. And I think Doris knows him as well

30:56.888 --> 31:06.921
as I do because when she worked out there, he was one 
of her bosses. But she couldn't work after I went to

31:09.124 --> 31:11.167
A&M. She had to give her job up. And

31:13.430 --> 31:17.836
he was a wonderful guy. And he took Penny... He

31:23.737 --> 31:38.067
was dean of students at one time and they 
mistreated, they held Penny responsible for a lot

31:23.737 --> 31:38.067
of things they did and so they did away with the dean 
of students for a little while.
