WEBVTT

00:02.900 --> 00:07.765
Testing, testing, one, two, three, four, testing, testing, testing.

00:09.446 --> 00:18.435
Testing, ABC, ABC, testing, testing.

00:18.455 --> 00:23.920
Testing, testing on Wednesday, May 1, I believe it is.

00:26.402 --> 00:27.924
Yeah, yeah.

00:29.946 --> 00:32.248
This is May the 1st.

00:32.583 --> 00:43.836
and I have the honor and pleasure of interviewing Dr. John McIntyre, professor of physics, about his years here.

00:46.099 --> 00:58.754
To introduce yourself to anyone who might hear the tape or read the transcription, give us a brief biographical summary of growing up and high school and college and experience before coming to A&M.

01:00.336 --> 01:02.218
Well, I grew up in Seattle, Washington,

01:02.671 --> 01:11.364
My father was a professor at the University of Washington in mechanical engineering, so naturally I was an engineer.

01:12.946 --> 01:25.485
But mechanical engineering was too much about burning coal and, I don't know, kind of grubby stuff, things you just had to memorize.

01:26.386 --> 01:31.834
So I switched to electrical engineering, which has much more theory to it than mechanical.

01:32.101 --> 01:37.967
and got my degree in electrical engineering, and then went to work during the war at Westinghouse.

01:38.327 --> 01:41.030
Was this at the University of Washington, where you get a drone?

01:41.050 --> 01:43.152
Yeah, I got my degree at the University of Washington.

01:43.913 --> 01:45.414
Go ahead.

01:45.434 --> 01:48.698
And during the war, I worked at Westinghouse, where we developed radar.

01:50.399 --> 02:00.049
We were building a radar to pick up airplanes that would attack from behind, tail gunner radar, that was it.

02:01.126 --> 02:03.589
And it wasn't very sophisticated.

02:03.609 --> 02:04.630
It didn't give any pictures.

02:06.572 --> 02:15.043
When the airplane came within a certain distance, a red light went on, and the tail gunner had to wake up and see what was happening.

02:15.063 --> 02:24.674
And then the war ended with the atomic bomb, and we were all thrown out of work, and we're going to be sent off to Japan to occupy Japan.

02:24.754 --> 02:29.800
But fortunately for the engineers, the Congress

02:30.843 --> 02:34.909
made it possible to go to graduate school and not get drafted.

02:35.751 --> 02:45.185
So I had planned to go to MIT being an engineer, but I had to get a job before I could get into graduate school.

02:45.265 --> 02:56.563
And somebody where I worked had come from Princeton, and he knew they were doing some research there on government contracts.

02:56.583 --> 02:58.065
So I got a job at Princeton.

02:58.822 --> 03:02.886
and I found out I was in one of the best physics departments in the country.

03:03.687 --> 03:09.534
I'd always thought of Princeton as tigers and hip flasks but turns out they had a good physics department.

03:10.274 --> 03:13.838
And on top of that Einstein lived in town and that made it more interesting.

03:14.679 --> 03:19.124
So I entered graduate school at Princeton and got my degree in physics at Princeton.

03:21.767 --> 03:26.652
Part of the reason was that I wondered what this

03:27.458 --> 03:33.924
what Truman called the atomic bomb, was really a nuclear bomb, how it worked, and nobody knew.

03:34.385 --> 03:42.592
And so I, just out of curiosity, I decided to take physics and did a research, my research in nuclear physics.

03:44.554 --> 03:53.803
Well then, my professor, Robert Hofstadter, was a very, I don't know,

03:54.053 --> 03:55.274
accessible person.

03:55.654 --> 04:06.283
The reason I did research with him was he was really the only professor at Princeton I could understand and he taught a course in optics which was a dead subject then.

04:07.004 --> 04:23.858
There were no lasers and so optics was a, nobody who was doing any research would do it in optics but Hofstadter taught the course in optics and they thought it was important that all physicists should know optics and

04:24.091 --> 04:25.694
So I did research with him.

04:25.774 --> 04:27.196
I was his only graduate student.

04:28.077 --> 04:32.364
And he made such a small impression at Princeton, he didn't get promoted.

04:33.766 --> 04:34.908
So he had to get a job.

04:35.629 --> 04:39.615
And at the time, jobs were pretty plentiful.

04:39.675 --> 04:42.159
He had an offer from Berkeley and one from Stanford.

04:43.501 --> 04:45.264
And Berkeley was the powerhouse.

04:45.304 --> 04:48.149
They had the big cyclotrons.

04:49.511 --> 04:52.275
And Stanford had built a new electron accelerator

04:53.622 --> 05:00.751
And they were having difficulty getting people to come and work on it because everybody knew electrons had nothing to do with nuclei.

05:02.854 --> 05:09.102
But it turned out in the end the reason electrons were so useful for nuclear physics is that they didn't knock the nucleus all apart.

05:09.963 --> 05:11.966
And you really knew what the nucleus was like.

05:12.446 --> 05:22.920
So Hostetter went to Stanford and I worked with him on his research and he won the Nobel Prize in 1961.

05:23.491 --> 05:24.774
Let's see, we went there in 1950.

05:25.134 --> 05:29.905
Now this is the same man that didn't get promoted at Princeton.

05:29.925 --> 05:30.025
Yeah.

05:30.045 --> 05:36.098
And he won a Nobel Prize before any of the professors at Princeton won a Nobel Prize.

05:36.118 --> 05:40.487
And he was just a very intelligent person, but he

05:41.665 --> 05:48.012
He was so straightforward and easy to understand that nobody was impressed by how smart he was.

05:48.032 --> 05:51.056
So, and he was a very nice man to work with.

05:51.296 --> 05:53.358
I was there at seven years at Stanford.

05:53.378 --> 06:00.286
And so then I went to Yale for six years working on a different kind of an accelerator.

06:00.987 --> 06:03.890
It was still nuclear physics.

06:03.910 --> 06:06.754
And then Texas A&M decided to build a cyclotron.

06:08.756 --> 06:11.419
And that is a very interesting story because

06:11.939 --> 06:16.065
There wasn't a single physicist at Texas A&M who knew anything about nuclear physics.

06:17.847 --> 06:20.992
They had a reactor, but that was in the nuclear engineering department.

06:21.893 --> 06:26.139
Share with this machine as much of how that came about as you know.

06:26.760 --> 06:27.021
All right.

06:28.262 --> 06:34.051
Well, the reason I got hired is they had to hire some nuclear physicists in order to get a cyclotron.

06:35.513 --> 06:41.862
And this is one of the places where Rudder really showed his abilities.

06:42.820 --> 06:44.242
He talked to the right people.

06:44.623 --> 06:50.613
He talked to the people of the National Academy of Sciences.

06:51.694 --> 06:58.105
And in particular, he talked to Glenn Seaborg, who was the head of the Atomic Energy Commission at the time.

06:59.667 --> 07:09.283
And Glenn Seaborg was also head of the Welsh Foundation, which was funded by a Texas oil man.

07:10.141 --> 07:20.276
who left as much money to the Welch Foundation for chemistry as the National Science Foundation had for the whole country in chemistry.

07:21.818 --> 07:29.630
And so Texas has powerhouse chemistry departments because all of this Welch money has to be spent in chemistry.

07:30.852 --> 07:38.663
Well, Glenn Seaborg was a nuclear chemist, although it's very difficult to distinguish a nuclear chemist from a nuclear physicist.

07:39.605 --> 07:42.769
And he was in the head of the Welsh Foundation.

07:42.829 --> 07:53.644
So the Welsh Foundation wanted to give money to the universities in Texas to do nuclear chemistry and that meant accelerators.

07:55.166 --> 08:04.279
Well, Rice had the most advanced nuclear physics department and it was always the physics departments that built the accelerators.

08:05.626 --> 08:07.788
And they had the most advanced department.

08:07.808 --> 08:13.013
They had a Van de Graaff, which was a cutting edge instrument.

08:14.114 --> 08:25.123
And Seaborg kind of wanted a cyclotron, which had a lot more intensity and power than the Van de Graaff.

08:25.143 --> 08:28.587
The Van de Graaff was for precision work in nuclear physics.

08:29.247 --> 08:33.591
The cyclotron blasted things and made a lot of radioactive chemicals.

08:34.178 --> 08:36.581
So Rice was not interested in a cyclotron.

08:38.244 --> 08:50.501
So then the Welsh Foundation turned to the University of Texas, and they had a small Van de Graaff, and they were coming along in chemical, in nuclear physics.

08:51.823 --> 08:58.493
But they had enough experienced people to know they didn't want to get in the business of building a cyclotron.

08:59.474 --> 09:03.780
In fact, you could buy a Van de Graaff at that time, a very good one, for about $2 million.

09:05.060 --> 09:16.678
And so I'm sure that the state legislature gave $2 million to Texas, I'm sure, for that Van de Graaff.

09:17.519 --> 09:22.928
And because there's a lot of Aggies in the legislature, they had to give $2 million to Texas A&M.

09:24.871 --> 09:26.594
Well, Texas A&M didn't have anything.

09:26.734 --> 09:29.378
They didn't have a nuclear physicist.

09:29.398 --> 09:30.660
And that's how I got hired.

09:30.740 --> 09:33.244
They had to hire some nuclear physicists.

09:34.608 --> 09:46.563
They hired a man from Berkeley who had worked on a cyclotron that Seaborg wanted to build, was built at Berkeley, and he was the director of the cyclotron.

09:46.583 --> 09:46.984
Who was he?

09:47.264 --> 09:49.227
He was George Igo, I-G-O.

09:52.190 --> 10:04.446
But they couldn't just have one man write a proposal, so they hired me and another professor, theoretical professor, John Gamal, and the three of us had our names on the proposal.

10:04.696 --> 10:11.786
As far as you know, who was the key person here working on all of the details?

10:11.806 --> 10:13.268
Yeah, he should be mentioned.

10:13.328 --> 10:19.978
Charles Squire was the man who organized it all and pulled it together.

10:20.058 --> 10:23.123
Actually, I met him in the New Haven Airports.

10:23.243 --> 10:24.424
He came up there to see me.

10:26.588 --> 10:28.651
Did he kind of interview you?

10:29.792 --> 10:33.117
Yeah, and then I already accepted a job

10:33.923 --> 10:36.727
It was one of those, back then, jobs were easy to get.

10:37.387 --> 10:40.792
But I had promised him I'd visit A&M.

10:41.753 --> 10:43.736
And so I visited.

10:44.276 --> 10:59.336
And A&M was so much more organized and hospitable than these other physics departments with physicists in charge of hospitality or kind of hopeless.

11:00.718 --> 11:03.441
And A&M, well, Squire had a

11:04.045 --> 11:05.466
a little car and everything.

11:05.567 --> 11:11.573
I meet people at certain times and well I just was impressed by the organization.

11:11.813 --> 11:31.032
Another thing that impressed me, I had an offer to go to Stony Brook which Governor Rockefeller had decided that New York State had no really good public universities and Stony Brook was going to be the crown jewel of the New York system and that what made it attractive

11:31.872 --> 11:37.237
But every time I talked to the head of the department before he could answer my question, he had to call Albany.

11:37.277 --> 11:44.504
Well, when I came to A&M, I walked into Earl Rudder's office and all the questions were answered right then and there.

11:45.585 --> 11:50.009
Describe your conversation with Mr. Rudder, that early conversation.

11:50.790 --> 11:59.618
Well, one of the things I was concerned about was I was coming to someplace out in the middle of the prairie with no technology.

12:00.205 --> 12:03.028
No machine shops, no electronic shops, nothing.

12:04.590 --> 12:08.094
And I was a nuclear physicist doing research and publishing papers.

12:09.876 --> 12:22.191
And the thing that really helped me to make the decision was that Texas A&M was one of the members of the Oak Ridge Institute.

12:22.251 --> 12:23.592
I don't know the name exactly.

12:24.393 --> 12:26.736
But Rudder arranged for me to

12:27.138 --> 12:31.325
get time on the Van de Graaff Accelerator at Oak Ridge for several years.

12:32.587 --> 12:40.319
And they arranged for one of the graduate students who was leaving Yale to go to Oak Ridge.

12:41.481 --> 12:44.085
And he came here eventually to work on our cyclotron.

12:45.107 --> 12:49.734
So that kind of made the transition much easier.

12:49.955 --> 12:52.639
Otherwise A&M had nothing out here.

12:53.227 --> 12:54.228
except to Hayfield.

12:54.989 --> 13:06.319
Now, Mr. Rudder was not a scholar himself, but in his conversations with you, did he seem well informed about this very serious matter?

13:07.260 --> 13:17.169
Yes, he had a good understanding of what made research people and academic people what was important to us.

13:17.750 --> 13:21.073
And I don't know how he got it, but he had it.

13:21.610 --> 13:31.825
And I think it was because he talked to the right people, Glenn Seaborg and, well, I should also mention, I forgot Hall's first name.

13:32.265 --> 13:32.726
Wayne Hall.

13:32.766 --> 13:33.667
Wayne Hall, yeah.

13:34.669 --> 13:36.852
I think he was a very positive factor.

13:36.952 --> 13:38.414
Vice President for Academic Affairs.

13:38.434 --> 13:39.195
Right, yeah.

13:39.596 --> 13:43.842
And this, these campus visits would have been in 62 or 63?

13:45.244 --> 13:46.406
Yeah, the spring of 63.

13:46.426 --> 13:46.746
63.

13:46.766 --> 13:50.672
I came in September, or summer of 63.

13:50.922 --> 13:53.566
All right, this is the only dollar question I'm going to ask you.

13:53.967 --> 13:55.409
What was your beginning salary?

13:56.290 --> 14:00.036
Well, let me tell you what my salary was at Yale first.

14:00.056 --> 14:05.464
It was $11,000 a year, and I got $17,000 coming here.

14:06.505 --> 14:10.972
And by the standards of the nation, that was a competitive salary?

14:11.152 --> 14:12.875
Yeah, A&M was competitive.

14:13.456 --> 14:15.799
Yeah, it was competitive to Stony Brook.

14:16.252 --> 14:20.116
What kind of... And this is what Squire did, I think.

14:20.156 --> 14:23.079
He knew what was going on.

14:23.600 --> 14:33.290
What kind of commitments, promises did A&M make to support you and this project, as you understand?

14:33.310 --> 14:39.736
Well, the way I looked at it at the time... Well, let me... They had the $2 million.

14:40.057 --> 14:40.437
Mm-hmm.

14:41.277 --> 14:46.325
And because they were going to build a cyclotron, the Welch Foundation gave them another million dollars.

14:47.647 --> 14:54.018
So the proposal we were writing was to the Atomic Energy Commission for three million dollars to match the three million we had.

14:54.138 --> 15:02.372
So this was a six million dollar project and the Texas was two million dollar project with the same amount of money essentially to start with.

15:02.412 --> 15:05.998
And Rudder had pyramided the thing into a much bigger project.

15:07.260 --> 15:08.061
And so

15:09.779 --> 15:15.165
When we got the money, we got this $3 million from the Atomic Energy Commission.

15:15.325 --> 15:20.711
But to let you know what it was like at the time, we were competing.

15:20.731 --> 15:23.153
There were 23 universities after that $3 million.

15:23.274 --> 15:26.437
And they were not peanuts.

15:26.557 --> 15:27.618
I mean, there was Princeton.

15:27.658 --> 15:28.439
There was Maryland.

15:28.479 --> 15:29.620
There was Indiana.

15:29.660 --> 15:33.024
There was, I mean, the big guys.

15:33.084 --> 15:33.785
They were after that.

15:33.805 --> 15:35.627
I mean, $3 million was $3 million.

15:35.887 --> 15:38.470
And when A&M got it,

15:39.935 --> 15:45.642
Why they said it's like giving a Cadillac to a peasant because we, you know, we had nothing.

15:46.683 --> 15:50.287
And I hadn't built an accelerator myself.

15:50.388 --> 15:51.869
I didn't know how to build an accelerator.

15:53.451 --> 16:00.980
But the way I looked at it, knowing my feeling was, well, if A&M has $3 million, they can do something with $3 million.

16:01.561 --> 16:05.085
They've got that in hand whether they get the other $3 million or not.

16:06.066 --> 16:07.528
So I took a gamble.

16:08.842 --> 16:14.588
But let me just recall one thing that was important in my thinking about it.

16:15.309 --> 16:17.091
We went out to lunch at Stony Brook.

16:18.212 --> 16:22.056
And Stony Brook had been a teacher's college.

16:22.076 --> 16:24.999
And they had the crummiest looking bunch of students you ever saw.

16:25.039 --> 16:26.821
There was trash all over the place.

16:28.142 --> 16:31.986
And at A&M was a little spick and span at the Memorial Student Center.

16:32.026 --> 16:37.532
And in those days they had tablecloths and napkins and everything.

16:37.951 --> 16:41.416
So it just seemed like a much... Well, I put it to myself.

16:41.476 --> 16:43.098
I'm going to wake up in the morning every day.

16:43.138 --> 16:45.541
Do I want to go here or do I want to go there?

16:45.601 --> 16:48.385
And so it was a gut feeling, really.

16:49.066 --> 16:50.308
But I've never regretted it.

16:50.388 --> 16:52.751
I mean, I got in on something very good, I think.

16:53.251 --> 16:53.372
Right.

16:53.392 --> 16:57.717
When you moved down here, describe family that you brought with you.

16:59.039 --> 17:02.684
Well, I had a wife and a boy, a boy 12 years old.

17:02.964 --> 17:03.325
Okay.

17:03.806 --> 17:04.887
And my wife...

17:05.795 --> 17:07.999
bless her soul, said, you make your decision.

17:08.059 --> 17:11.004
I'm not going to bother to go down there.

17:11.024 --> 17:17.415
But when we got here in August, driving through North Bryan was a shock.

17:19.018 --> 17:23.926
And then we got our air conditioned house, which turned out was window air conditioners that didn't work.

17:25.048 --> 17:27.513
So she was all ready to go back to Connecticut.

17:28.634 --> 17:31.279
But we headed for Seattle for two weeks.

17:32.390 --> 17:36.697
And every year, for two weeks, we leave Texas in the summer.

17:37.519 --> 17:38.500
That was part of the deal.

17:39.041 --> 17:41.705
And when you found a place to live, where did you find?

17:42.567 --> 17:48.477
Well, I was a professor of civil engineering, was on leave for a year.

17:49.218 --> 17:50.500
So it was on Brookside.

17:50.981 --> 17:53.405
It was an old house, but near the university.

17:54.206 --> 17:56.490
And he'd put some air conditioners in the window.

17:57.820 --> 18:09.358
Were you aware at that point of the study underway about what A&M's future ought to be?

18:09.398 --> 18:15.467
Were you aware that there was any thought being given to coeducation and non-compulsory core and all that?

18:16.669 --> 18:19.153
No, I think I learned most of that when I got here.

18:19.825 --> 18:24.450
I mean, when you're a research physicist, you don't worry too much about those things.

18:24.510 --> 18:31.678
I mean, I'd done research at Oak Ridge and Stanford and what was going on in the rest of the community.

18:31.698 --> 18:35.903
I wasn't at the stage where I was thinking about retirement or anything.

18:35.923 --> 18:42.009
I wanted to see what facilities have we got so I can do some research and publish some papers.

18:42.830 --> 18:48.837
When you went to work, what laboratory office, what

18:49.542 --> 18:52.146
What facilities were you provided?

18:53.128 --> 19:07.711
Well, I got, I was given an office in a physics building, and I started to do some, well, and I brought some equipment down from Yale, and they gave me some money.

19:07.991 --> 19:10.335
Dean Hubert raised some money for me to,

19:11.260 --> 19:12.201
by lead bricks.

19:12.261 --> 19:16.247
You don't move lead bricks from Yale.

19:16.267 --> 19:20.253
And so I set up an experiment here in the basement of the physics department.

19:20.273 --> 19:21.955
So they gave me a nice big laboratory.

19:22.616 --> 19:26.341
They were very accommodating and really essentially everything I needed.

19:26.622 --> 19:28.344
Who was the department head then?

19:28.364 --> 19:32.370
Oh, um, Potter.

19:32.550 --> 19:33.171
What's his name?

19:33.191 --> 19:34.433
Jim Potter.

19:34.970 --> 19:37.313
And I could tell there was a problem there.

19:37.794 --> 19:41.840
I wasn't introduced to Potter until I was almost ready to take the plane home.

19:42.962 --> 19:44.464
And obviously he and Squire did.

19:44.744 --> 19:52.696
Well Squire thought Potter was incompetent, and Potter was a very decent guy, but he'd been here for thirty years.

19:53.517 --> 19:54.919
They did no research here.

19:55.675 --> 20:02.405
And so he did teaching, and to Squire, teaching was a second-rate occupation.

20:03.006 --> 20:10.637
Now, the physics department at that time offered, on paper at least, offered both masters and PhDs.

20:11.298 --> 20:13.402
Yeah, that was one of the good things.

20:13.422 --> 20:17.287
You could get graduate students to help with your research, yeah.

20:17.308 --> 20:24.298
But before you came here, what physicist at Texas A&M had you ever heard of?

20:25.156 --> 20:44.979
Well, I'd never heard of any because they didn't have anybody in nuclear physics, but I did find there were some people here who were publishing the main one I recall as Mel Eisner, who, and maybe this is the point to mention that in the first five years I was here, six full professors left Texas A&M.

20:45.920 --> 20:51.467
There was no tenure, there was no need for tenure, because they were so busy trying to hire people that

20:51.869 --> 20:56.734
The whole idea that anybody would want to stay was not a problem.

20:58.636 --> 21:02.960
So it was, well, there was a transition period.

21:03.261 --> 21:06.604
How were you and your wife received by the department?

21:06.644 --> 21:12.750
Were there any social events in the department or for the department's members?

21:13.751 --> 21:15.593
Oh, yes, yeah.

21:15.613 --> 21:16.314
Yeah, they were good.

21:16.494 --> 21:17.455
Potter was very

21:17.873 --> 21:23.180
He'd go out, when we got a new graduate student, he'd go out and help him unpack his truck and move him in.

21:23.881 --> 21:26.925
I mean, he was just a very, very nice man.

21:27.306 --> 21:31.131
Did you have any teaching assignments?

21:31.151 --> 21:32.112
Yeah, yeah.

21:32.412 --> 21:42.025
I had, yeah, I taught a nuclear physics course, and there wasn't any nuclear physicists here.

21:42.916 --> 21:55.570
Well, at the end, when we got a lot of nuclear physicists, I ended up teaching the engineers, because a lot of physicists don't understand engineers, and since I was an engineer, I knew where they were coming from.

21:55.690 --> 21:57.252
These courses were at what level?

21:57.512 --> 21:58.913
A graduate or senior?

21:58.933 --> 21:59.374
Well, yeah.

22:00.115 --> 22:04.920
The nuclear physics was a graduate course, and then I taught optics for quite a while.

22:05.641 --> 22:06.882
That was a senior course.

22:07.537 --> 22:17.848
share some experiences for you and possibly a family of learning about Texas A&M and the community.

22:19.810 --> 22:24.154
Well, I can tell you one interesting interchange I had.

22:25.696 --> 22:31.762
Some people said, how did it come about?

22:31.862 --> 22:32.683
He said,

22:34.840 --> 22:35.942
Oh, where do you work?

22:35.962 --> 22:37.846
And I said, I work at the university.

22:37.966 --> 22:41.955
And they said, oh, you're visiting here from Austin.

22:41.975 --> 22:44.520
That's because the name officially then was A&M College.

22:44.540 --> 22:45.983
And it changed just that year.

22:46.083 --> 22:47.045
And I was innocent.

22:47.105 --> 22:50.031
I thought it had always been Texas A&M University.

22:50.618 --> 22:54.583
So things like that made me realize a little bit about the past history.

22:55.063 --> 22:59.549
But one thing A&M should be proud of, they have a tremendous tradition of teaching.

23:00.069 --> 23:11.803
And because they hadn't been doing research, they had a lot of good teachers, and they have a lot more interest in students than the average research university.

23:13.105 --> 23:17.470
There was a very good girl I had in engineering, and so she went to Stanford.

23:17.838 --> 23:24.847
And she said, for her master's degree, and she said the teaching at A&M is infinitely superior to Stanford.

23:24.867 --> 23:26.689
The professors aren't there half the time.

23:26.729 --> 23:29.453
They're off, you know, consulting and whatever.

23:30.354 --> 23:33.458
So they had the tradition of teaching here, which I think is a very strong.

23:33.878 --> 23:36.862
Did the students strike you as being pleasant, polite?

23:37.342 --> 23:38.324
Yeah, very good.

23:38.864 --> 23:41.007
And we use the same textbooks we use at Yale.

23:42.108 --> 23:43.390
The way I look at it is,

23:44.163 --> 23:48.749
The best A&M students are as good as the best at Yale.

23:49.370 --> 23:57.340
There's a few really bright guys like this beautiful mind that you, he probably wouldn't have shown up at Texas A&M.

23:58.322 --> 24:02.367
And Einstein wouldn't show up at Texas A&M.

24:02.567 --> 24:08.635
It's too much gung ho.

24:09.796 --> 24:17.891
For the average, I mean, for the good old American boy who's smart, and that's one reason I came here instead of Stony Brook.

24:17.911 --> 24:23.903
You take the smart kids across the country or in New England, they're gonna go to Harvard or Yale or Princeton.

24:23.923 --> 24:25.265
They're not gonna go to Stony Brook.

24:26.467 --> 24:31.517
And I thought, well, here state of Texas is a big industrial state.

24:31.936 --> 24:37.025
their smartest people are going to go to the MIT of Texas, which was Texas A&M.

24:37.486 --> 24:38.207
And that was true.

24:38.367 --> 24:39.610
We got good students.

24:39.870 --> 24:40.070
All right.

24:40.090 --> 24:46.201
When you arrived, how far along was the planning for the cyclotron?

24:46.221 --> 24:47.203
They didn't even have the money.

24:47.544 --> 24:48.505
Okay.

24:48.525 --> 24:52.472
So the proposal was still being... I had to sign the proposal, yeah.

24:52.513 --> 24:54.416
I mean, they had to get my name on the proposal.

24:55.318 --> 24:55.598
Now,

24:56.759 --> 24:59.062
Rudder kept, we kept saying, how's this coming on?

24:59.082 --> 24:59.883
He says, don't worry.

25:00.404 --> 25:03.868
I mean, the thing was settled before they hired me, probably.

25:04.529 --> 25:09.815
But they had to have a proposal with some nuclear physicist's name on it in order to get the money.

25:10.816 --> 25:14.821
Did Tiger Teague possibly help influence this?

25:15.022 --> 25:15.702
I suppose.

25:16.003 --> 25:18.226
I mean, Rudder didn't seem to be too concerned.

25:18.866 --> 25:23.352
He knew Seaborg, and Tiger Teague was there, and they had the skids greased, I think.

25:23.993 --> 25:25.855
But I didn't know about it, of course.

25:25.953 --> 25:28.978
I wonder, did LBJ reckon he was a factor?

25:32.082 --> 25:32.563
I don't know.

25:32.603 --> 25:35.147
He was not mentioned.

25:36.289 --> 25:41.177
I think LBJ was probably like Kennedy was with the Catholics.

25:41.878 --> 25:47.667
I knew some Catholics, and when Kennedy was elected, Kennedy said to them, look, you cannot expect anything from me.

25:49.810 --> 25:53.175
And LBJ probably had to say the same thing about Texas.

25:53.628 --> 25:59.155
All right then when did the construction really begin?

25:59.216 --> 26:19.483
Well we got the money in the spring of 64 and then the the first step was to decide how much it would cost well to design the building and and then they had to design the cyclotron and

26:20.257 --> 26:26.905
Nobody here built a cyclotron and this is where again Rudder was so intelligent.

26:27.045 --> 26:33.033
I mean he had been on the board of directors of some companies and one of them was Bechtel.

26:34.274 --> 26:37.398
And Bechtel builds these big reactors out in Saudi Arabia.

26:38.279 --> 26:45.148
Well in 1963 nuclear physics and nuclear energy was the big thing and Bechtel wanted to get in on it.

26:46.690 --> 26:49.133
And so Rudder knew Steve Bechtel.

26:49.940 --> 27:03.156
and they had this tremendous engineering staff in San Francisco and so they made a deal that that Steve Bechtel would build a cyclotron for three million dollars which he had to do because

27:04.283 --> 27:07.047
The federal government said, we don't want any more cost overruns.

27:07.428 --> 27:11.754
And Rudder said, don't worry, we'll bill it for $3 million.

27:11.774 --> 27:15.479
A typical Army guy, you know, we'll do it, and then he worries about how to do it afterwards.

27:15.519 --> 27:20.286
So he gets hold of Bechtel, and they said, OK, we'll do it for $3 million.

27:20.307 --> 27:25.494
And there was a cyclotron at Berkeley that more or less we copied.

27:26.636 --> 27:30.882
But they had to take all these, you know how universities are,

27:32.026 --> 27:37.153
kind of crummy drawings and put them in engineering form, so there was a lot of work to be done.

27:37.573 --> 27:41.639
And Bechtel did a good job, and they built the cyclotron, and there it is.

27:42.019 --> 27:44.443
Who decided on the exact geographic location?

27:45.464 --> 27:45.824
Do you know?

27:47.346 --> 27:50.290
Why was it put there instead of somewhere else?

27:50.310 --> 27:51.532
Well, I had a big fuss.

27:51.652 --> 27:55.317
I wanted to put it in the middle of the campus.

27:55.533 --> 27:57.937
I wanted to put it on the drill field.

27:57.957 --> 27:59.159
I didn't know anything, you see.

27:59.219 --> 28:03.226
So I wanted to put it next, well near the library, like a library.

28:03.246 --> 28:05.510
Well that was shot down.

28:06.211 --> 28:09.637
So it was put over there because it was near engineering.

28:09.957 --> 28:11.019
I think that was the reason.

28:12.101 --> 28:17.370
They didn't want to take a lot of value.

28:17.450 --> 28:20.916
Well one thing Hubert talked to me about was using the animal

28:21.723 --> 28:23.605
Science Center, that's a big building.

28:24.186 --> 28:26.889
You know, it's kind of just a big open floor.

28:28.211 --> 28:44.850
But we thought about it, but the cyclotron almost needs to be a special building with a lot of shielding and when you have to design the beam lines, I don't know whether you've been in the cyclotron, but it just doesn't fit into a square box.

28:45.851 --> 28:50.937
So that was the best we could get with the Animal Center, so we ended up where we were.

28:51.406 --> 28:56.894
Was Dean Benson a partner in this operation also?

28:58.276 --> 29:01.380
I don't think he was involved because it wasn't in engineering.

29:01.961 --> 29:11.595
It was, Hubert was the dean and Squire was associate dean of arts and science at the time.

29:12.076 --> 29:14.759
And it took about how long to construct?

29:17.083 --> 29:18.645
Well, let's see.

29:19.503 --> 29:23.349
Seaboard came and gave the dedication address in 1967.

29:23.689 --> 29:35.086
And the reason I remember that is it was the 25th anniversary of the first atomic pile in the stadium at the University of Chicago.

29:35.547 --> 29:42.036
So four years after you arrived, it was... We had a running cyclotron, yeah.

29:42.056 --> 29:49.307
Was there, were there any special experiences as you all began to... Well, this is where all the...

29:49.405 --> 29:59.695
professors were coming and going, I go on to redesign the cyclotron, which was not very smart when nobody ever built a cyclotron.

30:00.896 --> 30:05.801
And they had the AEC, it was their money, they were concerned.

30:05.841 --> 30:17.252
So they had somebody from Oak Ridge overseeing or consulting or whatever and they put, in fact they sent a chief engineer here

30:17.654 --> 30:19.757
from Oak Ridge to be the chief engineer.

30:21.660 --> 30:29.651
And so I go left within a year, and Dr. Suttle was put in, director of the cyclotron.

30:29.671 --> 30:33.617
Dr. Andrew Suttle, who was vice president for research.

30:33.637 --> 30:34.218
Dr. Right.

30:34.238 --> 30:36.882
Yeah.

30:36.902 --> 30:45.855
And so then with Bechtel on the job, the cyclotron was going to get built, and

30:48.265 --> 30:50.949
Let's see, I wasn't on the engineering side of it.

30:51.550 --> 30:54.113
I don't know whether Bechtel supervised the building of it.

30:54.754 --> 30:56.938
I think we probably supervised the building of it.

30:59.121 --> 31:03.407
Bechtel provided the drawings, and then we sent out the bids.

31:04.348 --> 31:17.327
I remember one very clever idea a man had, a tremendous amount of reinforced concrete all around the cyclotron, and it overlaps, it dovetails together,

31:17.628 --> 31:22.324
which you have to have reasonable tolerances otherwise you're going to get a crack and radiation comes out.

31:23.146 --> 31:27.300
So we got tremendously high bids to get that.
