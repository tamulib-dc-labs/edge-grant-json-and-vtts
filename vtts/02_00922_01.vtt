WEBVTT

00:02.984 --> 00:08.750
This is December 26th at 1214 Orr Street. My name is 
Bob Cornish and I'm interviewing Tom Niederauer

00:10.472 --> 00:19.601
in connection with the APA project, The History of 
Planning in Texas. First, Tom, I'd like to ask you,

00:21.684 --> 00:30.713
would you tell us what your position is in Dallas 
and how you came to get into planning. Currently,

00:35.914 --> 00:43.261
I'm the program manager for the urban design and 
environmental programs with the planning

00:35.914 --> 00:43.261
department in the city of Dallas. Initially, I was 
in architecture at A&M in the late 60s. Became

00:51.129 --> 01:00.379
involved politically to some extent with the 
political undercurrents, I guess, at that time. a

01:00.882 --> 01:01.803
summer in New York. Came very involved with people 
in politics. Enjoyed that end of life, I suppose.

01:12.516 --> 01:14.097
Translating that into architecture. I remember 
you from A&M. My fifth year project

01:16.640 --> 01:23.308
was the Community Design Center to begin that. 
Worked in the black community and worked with Joe

01:23.789 --> 01:26.252
McGraw. He helped get me started on that. about 
three or four weeks after I got started into it,

01:30.886 --> 01:35.391
Dolezal joined me. He lost interest in his 
project. So the two of us put it together for one

01:39.035 --> 01:48.345
semester and we brought in two junior members, our 
fourth year members at that time, to perpetuate

01:39.035 --> 01:48.345
this center. In any case, we spent the whole year 
restoring a house, helping the neighborhood,

01:49.666 --> 02:00.758
raising funds, preparing a presentation to 
council for a mini park.

02:02.712 --> 02:08.019
It's what I would call urban design now, not 
knowing at that time what urban design was. Did you

02:08.320 --> 02:09.361
go to Washington? Yes, George and I both, plus John 
O'Terry, I believe. We went for that first

02:15.991 --> 02:29.209
meeting, session, convocation or something of 
community design center types, and that further

02:15.991 --> 02:29.209
instilled my interest. interest, I guess, in the 
political side of architecture slash planning

02:29.527 --> 02:37.780
slash what I would now call urban design.

02:41.586 --> 02:47.475
Saw a job in Dallas in the planning department 
because of their neighborhood planning program,

02:41.586 --> 02:47.475
which I thought was comparable. As I mentioned to 
you earlier,

02:48.557 --> 02:55.568
we wanted to stay in Texas and then go on to New York. 
This seemed like a good place to be for the time

02:55.885 --> 02:59.268
being. I liked the metropolitan area and stayed 
away from Houston, so basically that leaves

03:00.249 --> 03:06.316
Dallas. That's how we got to Dallas and how I became 
interested in planning. I was actually hired not

03:11.961 --> 03:17.006
really knowing what I was doing. I was hired as part 
of the initial staff of the urban design program up

03:17.367 --> 03:25.555
there.

03:26.598 --> 03:30.302
Well, your project at A&M helped you, didn't it? 
Yeah. On Hearn? Hearn. Were you on the Hearn

03:33.245 --> 03:34.927
project? No. In my section? I don't recall that 
one. No, I bet apparently you were not. No, it was

03:43.236 --> 03:54.228
mostly this community design center out here that 
got me turned on to the political or social side of

03:43.236 --> 03:54.228
planning and architecture. But that stuck. that 
had become involved in the urban design programs

03:57.226 --> 04:02.031
and Wei Ming Lu came and we began to put all of that 
together. Robin McCaffrey, a very inventive

04:02.071 --> 04:15.585
person, he and I both started working in the 
planning department together and probably it was

04:02.071 --> 04:15.585
the association with Robin that helped me stick 
with that. Otherwise I might have lost interest

04:17.067 --> 04:22.232
and we sort of helped each other get along through 
the earlier parts until Wei Ming came. Who was the

04:23.874 --> 04:25.756
planning director then? Jim Schroeder. James M. 
Schroeder, Jr., actually, was the acting

04:27.398 --> 04:32.605
director at that time. The mayor was Eric Johnson.

04:38.534 --> 04:42.399
That was of some significance because he was a 
strong planner. It was primarily through his

04:43.261 --> 04:50.491
Goals for Dallas program that he essentially 
mandated this urban design setup.

04:53.755 --> 04:57.000
Johnson opposed Schroeder becoming the planning 
director Johnson wanted to go out. In fact, he was

04:58.951 --> 05:03.297
very interested in bacon out of Philadelphia. He 
was a very strong design

05:03.997 --> 05:09.204
person. That's where Johnson wanted to take us. 
Schroeder won the position through a lot of

05:13.308 --> 05:20.457
in-house politics, I suppose. One never knows 
exactly, but he was very developer-oriented and

05:21.358 --> 05:27.325
had made a lot of those associations. And they, of 
course, still had a very strong influence in

05:27.997 --> 05:31.861
Dallas at that time. So Schroeder won the 
position. In fact, I think it was about Christmas

05:35.085 --> 05:41.351
1970 when he became director.

05:44.555 --> 05:46.617
Just, yeah, I see. That's about the time you got 
there. Yeah, I'd been there for six months or so.

05:52.403 --> 05:53.905
But he was putting the department together. Who 
was the director before Schroeder? I'm trying to

05:57.798 --> 05:58.880
remember the guy's name. It's Alvin Deyo, 
D-E-Y-O, I believe. He had long since left before

06:02.545 --> 06:10.075
I, Schroeder was acting director for almost two 
years, I believe, maybe a little longer. So Deyo

06:10.596 --> 06:13.740
had left in like 68, something. I know very little 
about him, and it was, he was there for a fairly

06:13.961 --> 06:27.720
short period, I think, because Springer left in 
63, four, five, now I've forgotten.

06:28.072 --> 06:28.933
Okay. Well, we're interviewing Springer and 
Shorter, too, so we can make cross-connections

06:29.274 --> 06:37.344
and all that. Some of this information you may or 
may not know, and if you don't, we'll just skip over

06:37.685 --> 06:45.254
it because some of it can be done by library work. Do 
you happen to remember or know when the first

06:45.274 --> 06:52.143
comprehensive plan was authorized for Dallas? I 
don't know of any official documents that

06:57.687 --> 07:01.632
authorize or are adopted a comprehensive plan in 
Dallas. Now the attitude since I've been there is

07:01.652 --> 07:10.563
that our zoning maps, the maps are the 
comprehensive plans. Essentially the

07:12.426 --> 07:18.353
boundaries indicate what's to be built where, but 
they are not comprehensive. Well, Dallas has

07:20.135 --> 07:22.378
substituted zoning for General comprehensive 
planning. Right. Well, I say that's the attitude.

07:27.704 --> 07:36.579
I think that's the legal excuse, if we're 
challenged, that the city is prepared to defend

07:27.704 --> 07:36.579
itself with. I've heard that. Does Alec Bickley go 
along with that? Well, now, Bickley's a former

07:42.488 --> 07:44.311
city attorney. I know. That probably came from 
Bickley. I'm not sure where that attitude came

07:49.021 --> 07:51.043
from. It was something that sort of floated around 
the office. All planners come in and say, where's

07:53.686 --> 07:59.333
our comprehensive plan and why aren't we doing 
one? For ten years. And the new crop that's come in

08:00.815 --> 08:03.778
this year says the same thing. We are working 
towards a comprehensive plan at this time with

08:04.799 --> 08:08.524
Shoup. Schroeder put one together. It wasn't a bad 
plan overall, accepted by the commission. Don't

08:16.983 --> 08:18.585
think he did his politicking well. And that's 
obvious. It didn't pass. So I don't know whether to

08:21.108 --> 08:23.671
blame him or not. But it did not get through 
council. And it became the platform for the

08:27.655 --> 08:33.482
mayor's race, which was a special election. And 
that's when Bob Folsom came in with like 50.2% of

08:33.822 --> 08:42.232
the vote over 49.8% for Weber, who was in favor of 
it. So the community is very split. Bob Folsom's

08:44.575 --> 08:46.517
done. very influential home developer primarily 
in the north part of Dallas.

08:53.022 --> 08:57.427
SMUX, which seems to be a... What position was he 
running for? Oh, the mayor. Oh, and he was elected.

08:59.930 --> 09:07.959
At that time, Wes Wise was mayor, resigned to run 
for Congress, and so there was a special election

08:59.930 --> 09:07.959
to fill the mayor's post. Gary Weber, who was on the 
council, who was a stockbroker primarily, was on

09:07.979 --> 09:16.369
the council, resigned to run for the mayor's 
position, so that opened up another position on

09:07.979 --> 09:16.369
council. So there were two positions open, 
basically. And it was a heated race. And somewhere

09:22.306 --> 09:25.489
in the neighborhood of a half million dollars 
spent.

09:28.652 --> 09:29.713
When was this? In 16, I mean, 75. I believe that's 
when it was. I have to check back exactly. Adeline

09:39.963 --> 09:42.265
Harrison was on city council at that time. And she 
became, in fact, the acting mayor during a short

09:42.326 --> 09:46.930
period of time. This was after Johnson? Yeah, 
yeah. Wes Wise was a two-and-a-half term mayor

09:50.930 --> 09:59.883
after Eric Johnson, the half term being when he 
resigned to run for Congress. Bob Folsom filled

10:01.345 --> 10:06.473
the other half, and then the last two terms.

10:09.397 --> 10:14.284
But it was a heated race, and as I said, a half 
million dollars approximately spent. the

10:14.838 --> 10:19.004
campaign and the issue was the comprehensive plan 
for Dallas.

10:22.189 --> 10:30.241
It's almost an even split in the community and one 
never knows how the community actually feels

10:22.189 --> 10:30.241
about the comprehensive plan. There were other 
issues,

10:31.403 --> 10:43.461
but it was interesting and being an optimist 
rather than a pessimist, I didn't look at fulsome

10:43.913 --> 10:53.367
winning as a mandate from the public not to have 
planning, but rather it answered some questions

10:43.913 --> 10:53.367
that I'd had and that we'd had in the planning 
department for years. This community does not

10:53.427 --> 10:55.129
want planning. Here we had good evidence that at 
least half the community wants it. So, as I say,

10:59.976 --> 11:04.843
being optimistic, that's been a driving force for 
us. We feel a community is receptive. So why is this

11:07.968 --> 11:09.630
pro-planning? Why is And Folsom was not? All 
right, this was Weber and Folsom. Oh, Weber and

11:15.522 --> 11:17.284
Folsom. Gary Weber, who now is the county 
commissioner, county judge. And is he

11:22.051 --> 11:23.874
pro-planting or otherwise? I'm not clear on that. 
Yes, yes. Weber was on the council when Wayne Ming

11:26.738 --> 11:42.220
came to town, and he was our conduit for urban 
design programs for a couple of years until

11:26.738 --> 11:42.220
Adeline Harrison resigned from the planning 
commission and ran for city council, and then she

11:26.738 --> 11:42.220
and Weber both. became a very strong alliance for 
pro-planning. Environmental issues, the sign

11:45.552 --> 11:51.980
ordinance, historic preservation, those kinds 
of issues were passed during that period. I'm

11:52.861 --> 12:03.855
assuming that because of him, that would explain 
the large budgets that were set aside for urban

11:52.861 --> 12:03.855
design at that time in Dallas.

12:06.718 --> 12:10.603
Probably the largest budgets of any planning 
department in the country for urban design. Yeah,

12:11.107 --> 12:12.810
at that time, it was quite large. We had upwards of 
19 people, I believe, at one time.

12:18.920 --> 12:20.102
I don't know what to attribute that to. Really, 
that was sort of a residual effect from Eric

12:20.143 --> 12:34.988
Johnson's days, more than anything, and just Wei 
Ming's ability to be a good bureaucrat and grow.

12:43.338 --> 12:54.815
Tom, could you just give us a quick synopsis of the 
history of the urban design efforts in the Dallas

12:43.338 --> 12:54.815
Planning Department? Yeah, quickly, from the 
Goals for Dallas program, it was apparent that the

12:56.517 --> 13:06.892
citizens wanted some sort of an urban design focus 
for planning. From that, Eric Johnson instructed

13:10.743 --> 13:20.258
his city manager, the city manager at that time, 
Scott MacDonald, to put together an urban design

13:10.743 --> 13:20.258
section in the planning department. He, in turn, 
worked with Jim Schroeder, who was acting

13:21.219 --> 13:26.327
director at that time, to reorganize the planning 
department. There were essentially two

13:27.389 --> 13:38.286
assistant directors, one for zoning and 
subdivisions and development plans, and so more

13:27.389 --> 13:38.286
than one for urban design. There were some other 
program areas directly under Schroeder. But the

13:42.479 --> 13:54.356
urban design position, being an assistant 
director, was an unclassified, I'm sorry, a

13:42.479 --> 13:54.356
classified position, meaning salary is a 
negotiable, not a civil service position. Oh,

13:54.676 --> 13:56.599
yeah. Yeah. Schroeder proceeded to interview, 
advertise and interview for the urban design

13:57.260 --> 14:02.868
position. And in the summer of 71, he hired a few 
people during that period, Robin McCaffrey and

14:02.928 --> 14:09.117
myself being two. to help form a foundation for the 
urban design program. And he hired Wei Ming Liu in

14:13.087 --> 14:15.570
the summer of 1971. I'm

14:16.031 --> 14:22.399
sorry, it was about Christmas of 1970. And Wei Ming 
came from Minneapolis, as I recall. That's right.

14:27.525 --> 14:30.449
Where he had put in place a pretty good urban design 
program. He had started one up there, yeah.

14:34.154 --> 14:39.441
Minneapolis is a considerably different 
situation. good experience to draw to bring to

14:39.809 --> 14:42.192
Dallas. But when he came to work in July of 71, and 
that's basically how we got started. I failed to

14:51.141 --> 14:54.065
mention the Urban Design Task Force. Eric Johnson 
instructed Scott McDonald to put together the

14:55.726 --> 15:06.458
Urban Design Task Force, a group made up of 
primarily the community's leading architects,

14:55.726 --> 15:06.458
design related. professionals of landscape and 
planners as well.

15:12.881 --> 15:16.888
I guess the leader of that group at that time was Jim 
Pratt of Pratt, Box, and Henderson. There were

15:17.789 --> 15:22.857
others associated with it, but, and a few business 
people that were involved. They... Is that Hal

15:23.618 --> 15:26.442
Box? Well, now Box was not involved, but Jim Pratt 
was. Yeah, it's Hal, that's the firm. It was Hal

15:32.993 --> 15:35.196
Box, Jim Pratt, and What's Henderson? Phil 
Henderson. An L box is now at UT Austin. Right,

15:39.663 --> 15:42.066
right, same box. But the Urban Design Task Force 
essentially helped us get our start in terms of

15:43.007 --> 15:51.057
organization of the division. The AIA sponsored a 
booklet that the Urban Design Task Force wrote on

15:52.038 --> 16:02.871
urban design in Dallas, what it should be, some of 
the issues that should be addressed at that time.

16:04.522 --> 16:08.249
And Wayming was essentially hired with their 
approval. And so, politically, I'd say they

16:08.690 --> 16:13.239
helped us get our start. They're still in 
existence and we're going through problems right

16:14.000 --> 16:22.176
now as to what their role is and so forth. They're an 
advisory group to the city manager. That's

16:24.803 --> 16:29.249
probably enough, I think, of that end of it. Yeah, 
OK. Well, let's move on then. By the way, I just want

16:32.434 --> 16:50.120
to ask you, in retrospect now, do you think that the 
urban design task force and the efforts made by the

16:32.434 --> 16:50.120
urban designers in the planning department have 
been productive in Dallas? Definitely. Could you

16:52.345 --> 17:07.684
cite some examples of the consequences of funding 
such a comprehensive urban design effort over the

16:52.345 --> 17:07.684
last 10 years? You mean specific projects or 
on-the-ground events? Yeah, if you could just

17:11.289 --> 17:14.713
name some things that have resulted from it. I can 
think of one little short street right downtown

17:15.034 --> 17:20.400
that was cut through for a pedestrian street. 
Yeah. Well, you know, my attitude is that urban

17:22.265 --> 17:43.453
design has been around for years and years and 
years and years and years, but it's been done by

17:22.265 --> 17:43.453
public works departments or parks departments or 
sometimes planning departments, if they happen

17:22.265 --> 17:43.453
to have an architect on board, which most planning 
departments seem to do, and so forth. So I think

17:43.473 --> 17:48.399
there's always been urban design going on in 
cities, but not an urban design focus. It's been an

17:49.461 --> 17:51.343
implicit focus. kind of operation, rather than 
explicitly Dallas. Right, right. Same in Dallas.

17:56.862 --> 18:03.611
We'd had Stone Place Mall was essentially an urban 
design project downtown before we had an urban

17:56.862 --> 18:03.611
design division. Not far different than Akron 
Street, a different kind of situation, but

18:04.712 --> 18:12.963
anyways, to say that we have had urban design in the 
past. What, what, what Wei Ming did, he began to

18:14.445 --> 18:21.634
focus on the design aspects of planning and 
including the community in making design

18:22.154 --> 18:25.878
decisions. And, of course, I've learned a lot from 
him, and that's my philosophy, too, as to what

18:26.318 --> 18:32.485
urban design is, or at least a part of it. So, a lot of 
community involved at the first was really

18:34.426 --> 18:47.740
important, and we had a sign ordinance issue that 
was in front of us when he came, and he used that very

18:34.426 --> 18:47.740
effectively. to focus on the urban design 
program. And we spent $100,000 for consultants in

18:50.456 --> 19:09.340
the early 70s, which was a considerable amount of 
money then, still is now, but national

18:50.456 --> 19:09.340
consultants, and

18:50.456 --> 19:09.340
put together a very comprehensive, progressive 
sign, set of sign regulations. In addition to the

19:10.542 --> 19:14.487
sign ordinance, have there been any other 
products or projects that have come about because

19:15.361 --> 19:26.178
of the urban design program in the De Plany 
department? Well, that's what I was saying. Wayne

19:27.621 --> 19:33.370
Manning had the ability to utilize his political 
base for spin-offs. The interest generated in the

19:33.974 --> 19:45.370
community on the sound artist, for example, he 
used some of those same people to get the Historic

19:33.974 --> 19:45.370
Preservation Foundation through Chapter 19A in 
our zoning ordinance, permits us to do historic

19:33.974 --> 19:45.370
preservation. I've institutionalized that 
since he left, and we're making it routine almost,

19:46.933 --> 20:00.252
and in fact trying not to call attention to it to 
some extent, to just build the program. But that

20:01.362 --> 20:11.615
was probably the most important one in terms of the 
actual physical impact on the community,

20:01.362 --> 20:11.615
historic preservation programs.

20:14.719 --> 20:22.048
Other specific projects, well, a spinoff of the 
historic preservation program is the

20:14.719 --> 20:22.048
establishment of the West End Historic District. 
We now have a five block long mall being

20:22.068 --> 20:30.238
constructed downtown on Market Street in the 
center of the historic district. combination,

20:30.556 --> 20:34.741
historic preservation and urban design project.

20:38.666 --> 20:43.011
We did a neighborhood study of the Little Mexico 
area, El Barrio it's called. Robin McCaffrey, in

20:44.733 --> 20:46.195
fact, did that. And we got considerable 
improvements on the park in the center of that

20:47.096 --> 20:53.944
community. That was another pretty significant 
project.

21:00.222 --> 21:04.667
again through historic preservation, Wayming 
had a very sharp political eye.

21:08.511 --> 21:20.403
We have a historic district

21:08.511 --> 21:20.403
in South Dallas, the black part of the city, for 
example. So he's very aggressive politically at

21:20.483 --> 21:28.592
hitting all the bases, and I'm sorry to follow in 
that same vein. some of the more significant

21:28.927 --> 21:30.670
projects. Now we also began quite a number of 
environmental programs at that time, and we have a

21:31.332 --> 21:41.471
set of escarpment regulations for development of 
the escarpment along the southwestern part of the

21:31.332 --> 21:41.471
city. And some of that stuff is just now coming.

21:47.002 --> 21:49.467
Okay, let's proceed on then.

21:52.197 --> 21:53.659
You're doing planning in Texas, right? Not urban 
design in Texas. Yeah. Let's go back to the subject

21:56.243 --> 21:59.147
of the comprehensive plan. I know that there were 
some planning consultants operating in the 20s in

22:01.130 --> 22:10.503
Dallas and so forth, and other people talk about 
those too. You say that there is no really adopted

22:12.226 --> 22:17.353
comprehensive plan for Dallas at this time. So 
we'll go on to some of these other questions then.

22:22.370 --> 22:29.820
If your city does not conduct comprehensive 
planning, how would you characterize its

22:22.370 --> 22:29.820
planning style? For example, does Dallas do 
advocacy planning by various groups, or does it do

22:31.182 --> 22:43.938
incremental planning as subjects are brought up 
by developers? Does the city then respond to the

22:44.018 --> 22:47.823
ideas of other people? Who takes the leadership 
role in formulating plan concepts for Dallas and

22:51.867 --> 23:01.298
major development, I mean really major key 
development proposals? I would say it's worked in

23:03.440 --> 23:13.832
all those ways at different times, depending on 
the leadership at the time, the planning director

23:03.440 --> 23:13.832
at the time. Weiming Liu, again, had provided a lot 
of leadership in terms of progressive advocacy

23:15.754 --> 23:21.300
planning. and gave Jim Schroeder the ability to 
become an advocate himself as the director of the

23:22.006 --> 23:30.479
department. I would not call Schroeder an 
advocate planner in most senses of the word, but

23:31.460 --> 23:42.217
the ability to use the staff in that respect. 
Mostly it's been a developer-directed

23:42.698 --> 23:49.448
city, perhaps. That's a good word. No, we don't 
advocate for the most part. And that's, urban

23:53.092 --> 23:59.319
design was considered to be fairly radical for 
that reason, that we were pushing programs. Has

24:00.381 --> 24:12.815
there been any particular identifiable group 
within Dallas that hired their own planner as

24:00.381 --> 24:12.815
their advocate planner to make proposals to the 
city? On what scale? That's... Oh, a neighborhood

24:16.019 --> 24:18.422
scale, even. or for a large industrial complex or 
what have you. Okay, on a neighborhood scale, I'd

24:23.215 --> 24:40.946
say only recently, but still they're very 
sketchy, more in terms of hiring traffic planners

24:23.215 --> 24:40.946
to fight street and thoroughfare decisions and 
those kinds of things, rather than actually

24:23.215 --> 24:40.946
laying out some sort of comprehensive approach to 
their neighborhood planning. But certainly

24:40.966 --> 24:45.574
developers have, John Stimmons is probably the, 
probably one of the state's largest industrial

24:46.297 --> 24:55.571
planners because of so much land. Trammell Crowe 
does quite a bit of planning work. He's doing the

24:59.597 --> 25:05.345
market center around Stimmins Expressway, built 
the Anatole. He has a comprehensive plan for that

25:05.365 --> 25:07.288
whole area. Does he share it with anybody? No. It's 
a backroom plan. That's right. He's doing the same

25:15.845 --> 25:21.611
with the northeast section of downtown, where we 
intended on putting an arts district. And he has

25:21.631 --> 25:23.793
completely co-opted our plan. So I would say 
Stimmons and Crow, and as a matter of fact,

25:26.515 --> 25:35.544
Stimmons and Crow were in partnership on a good bit 
of the development along Stimmons Expressway.

25:37.606 --> 25:40.489
Those are the two key people, I think, in terms of 
individuals. I think that... Crowe did Park

25:44.093 --> 25:48.177
Central too, which is at the corner of LBJ and 
Central. A huge complex. Park Central? Yeah. Is

25:53.081 --> 25:55.563
that where the North Park Shopping Center is? No, 
it's on further north. It's at the next tier.

26:01.268 --> 26:02.549
The Marriott Hotel's there. I'm trying to think 
what's there. A lot of office buildings. There's a

26:06.733 --> 26:09.215
hospital there and so forth. I think Marvin 
Springer knows quite a bit about Stemmons and what

26:09.235 --> 26:13.459
he was doing. because that was during his era. A lot 
of his work, yeah. So we'll be able to pick up more

26:16.678 --> 26:21.082
from the interview with Marvin Springland on 
that. Ross Perot is planning half of the city of

26:21.623 --> 26:27.108
Plano now. Is that right? Yeah, and they're going 
to annex a lot of land that he's planned. It will

26:32.994 --> 26:34.175
double their tax base. He's done some of that in 
Dallas. Plano is apparently experiencing

26:39.080 --> 26:42.383
fantastic growth and also escalating property 
values that are creating all sorts of problems.

26:48.177 --> 26:53.664
They're creating a lot of problems for us, and 
we're not reaping the benefits. I don't know if I

26:53.684 --> 26:56.407
answered your question, but we've been all of 
those things. We've done what some would call a

26:56.427 --> 27:00.972
sign ordinance and some of those things, radical 
planning. Certainly it's advocacy planning.

27:03.095 --> 27:09.282
Well, radical planning I would typify as being 
almost advocating structural changes in

27:03.095 --> 27:09.282
government and that sort of thing. We've come 
close. But no, I'm certainly not that radical. But

27:12.756 --> 27:14.540
the circumstances are hardly radical. That's 
within the context of the status quo in terms of

27:14.720 --> 27:20.250
operational government. Where it's radical, 
though, is that it's the first time that we've had

27:20.270 --> 27:32.232
something that seemed punitive towards a 
businessman as much as that because we have an

27:20.270 --> 27:32.232
amortization clause requiring them to remove 
signs. That end of it was sort of radical from our

27:32.752 --> 27:35.254
department. Well, yeah, but in terms of 
theoretical planning, it would be considered

27:35.455 --> 27:41.360
quite ordinary. Oh, I agree with you. Well, let's 
go on to, are you familiar with zoning in Dallas at

27:43.202 --> 27:50.049
all? Do you remember when the first zoning 
ordinance was adopted? I believe it was 1929. I had

27:53.632 --> 28:02.100
done a little research on that before, and the key 
dates are 1929 Oh, God, I can't remember the next

28:03.532 --> 28:05.635
increment. It seems like it was 1939. I've 
forgotten the 30s date. Okay, well, as you know,

28:08.999 --> 28:21.156
Texas state law requires that cities have an 
adopted comprehensive plan before they have an

28:08.999 --> 28:21.156
adopted zoning ordinance. Does Dallas fulfill 
the state law requirement? No, not to my

28:24.941 --> 28:26.183
knowledge. We've questioned that internally 
before, as I mentioned. There's been no taxpayer

28:30.429 --> 28:32.712
suits testing that? Okay. All right, now let's go 
on to the next question. What administrative

28:37.324 --> 28:43.611
procedures and planning program elements does 
your community have for implementing community

28:37.324 --> 28:43.611
plans? For example, do you have a department of 
current planning where they review all plat

28:45.332 --> 28:53.141
proposals and that sort of thing? You're talking 
about for new development? Yeah. Development

29:00.350 --> 29:03.172
Services, I believe it's called. I don't know what 
it's called. I've changed the title every two

29:04.173 --> 29:05.935
years. It handles all zoning and subdivision 
review. The whole department, however, reviews

29:09.218 --> 29:14.462
all zoning and subdivision requests. The entire 
department? Yeah. This is just... That means that

29:15.943 --> 29:27.653
you don't have any group within the planning 
department then that has as its primary task the

29:15.943 --> 29:27.653
formulating of long-range plans. Oh, no, no. I'm 
talking about only the... the administrative

29:30.185 --> 29:36.254
aspects of subdivision zoning review. Well, you 
said the entire department does this? The entire

29:38.918 --> 29:40.580
department reviews those. This one division 
focuses on that and makes up the dockets, for

29:40.701 --> 29:49.654
example, and takes them to the planning 
commission. We do have a long-range planning

29:49.994 --> 29:52.498
group right now. It's called Land Use and Public 
Facilities Division. I see. And we were working,

29:56.344 --> 29:59.128
intended... We're working towards a 
comprehensive plan in three years. And with this

30:02.721 --> 30:06.125
recent budget cut, that's been delayed. We don't 
know at this point what we'll be doing. I see. But,

30:09.849 --> 30:15.294
yeah, we have a neighborhood planning group, 
which works at the sort of medium scale. We have the

30:17.016 --> 30:22.802
land use and public facilities planning group, 
which works at the growth scale for the most part.

30:22.822 --> 30:28.508
We have a CBD planning group, which focuses on just 
downtown, a very small group. And then urban

30:28.893 --> 30:39.224
design essentially fills in the cracks on some of 
those things as well as advocating our own

30:28.893 --> 30:39.224
programs. Okay, do you recall when the city first 
established the planning department? It was

30:46.311 --> 30:52.858
established under the Public Works Department 
for some time and it was split off, I believe, This

30:54.222 --> 30:58.648
is something that's going to need some checking, 
and Springer can fill you in on this. I think

30:58.728 --> 31:03.934
Springer was the first planning director, and 
that's when the split was made. I believe it was the

31:04.415 --> 31:05.636
early 60s. I see. Well, not until after the Second 
World War. Maybe it was the 50s. I'm not sure, to

31:10.583 --> 31:12.265
tell you the truth. Well, we can check on that. Do 
you know how many professional planners there are

31:15.088 --> 31:18.933
in the planning department now? At this time, I 
believe there are 35. We were authorized for 38

31:21.457 --> 31:23.419
positions. under this budget year with a cut. The 
position to authorize the fund, the salaries

31:28.365 --> 31:31.603
weren't.
