WEBVTT

00:02.242 --> 00:08.192
Of all the experiences I've had, I'm more thankful 
for that than anything in my whole life, really.

00:16.927 --> 00:21.956
What were the experiences that helped to draw 
Aggies together? Like, do you remember going to

00:22.016 --> 00:24.200
Silver Taps? Oh, yeah. Gosh, yeah. Did you take it 
seriously? Oh, yeah. I still almost cry when I hear

00:29.965 --> 00:31.669
it. Did your buddies? Oh, yeah, absolutely. And it 
was always respectful? Oh, just thinking about

00:36.341 --> 00:39.670
it, I'm choking. Do you remember going to muster? 
Yeah, yeah. I went to several, not many. I've never

00:48.943 --> 00:50.805
been to one locally. One that I wished I could have 
gone to was 10 years ago this year, the survivors of

00:50.945 --> 01:04.300
the Corregidor Muster were back on campus. Oh my 
gosh. Don't I wish I could have heard their

01:05.462 --> 01:08.225
stories. Oh gosh, yeah. You're seeing your ring. 
How much did it cost? Do you remember?

01:19.635 --> 01:20.116
I bought two. I bought one for her and one for me. I 
bought hers and mine. And I don't wear it very

01:23.879 --> 01:25.160
often. It still looks new because when I was 
cutting meat, you know, I just wear it when I go out,

01:25.200 --> 01:31.546
you know. I don't remember. You've never lost it? 
No. Do you have any ring stories where somebody

01:36.090 --> 01:42.415
somewhere in some faraway place noticed 
something? Oh, yeah, yeah. I don't remember the

01:45.288 --> 01:50.618
stories, you know, but yeah, people notice it. Why 
is an Aggie ring so precious? I think people know

01:56.730 --> 02:02.901
how we feel about it maybe, and it just kind of comes 
out, you know. Because whenever you get any

02:04.433 --> 02:09.461
comments, you know, they're pretty well aware of 
it. Is the spirit still there? Oh, yes. Oh, yes.

02:14.268 --> 02:16.732
Even with the civilians, the non-regs? And the 
women may have more pride than the men. Well, women

02:19.657 --> 02:20.959
are good about that. Yes, yes. You know, they are. 
Yes. All right. You stayed in the Corps. through

02:27.873 --> 02:29.998
your fifth semester. Yeah, let's see. Yeah. And 
then got out. Where did you live then as a non-reg?

02:39.698 --> 02:41.242
In dorm 12, or was it? OK. You lived on campus? Those 
dorms that were numbered. You lived on campus?

02:44.228 --> 02:44.549
Yeah. Oh, yes, on campus. Sure. Now, the fact that 
you had been in the Corps and were then a non-reg,

02:47.060 --> 02:54.155
did that matter in terms of friendships and 
acceptance and everything? No, no. And my

02:54.656 --> 02:58.083
roommate that I had while I was a non-reg had the 
same problem. And so he had been in the Corps. And I

03:02.292 --> 03:03.735
knew him from before. So you didn't buy senior 
boots. No. And you didn't get to go through final

03:10.536 --> 03:13.759
review. No. Commencement. You attended 
commencement. Oh, yes. All right. You're not yet

03:22.208 --> 03:24.710
married, but now you're serious. By the time 
you're graduating, are you serious with that

03:25.030 --> 03:27.873
young man? Yeah. Who came to commencement when you 
graduated? A cousin of mine that was... I always

03:34.698 --> 03:40.283
thought he was an uncle because he was so much older 
than I was, but he was a cousin and my brother, the

03:34.698 --> 03:40.283
only two that came. This special young lady didn't 
come? No. Well, she was still in school. And mom and

03:46.728 --> 03:48.389
dad didn't come? No. Well, my mother had died. My 
mother died in May. She died in 49, but I don't

03:55.595 --> 03:58.558
remember, February, March. She had a heart 
problem. And then daddy had the store, you know. He

04:05.073 --> 04:08.418
couldn't come, but he sent my cousin and my brother 
came. And they were impressed. Do you remember

04:12.785 --> 04:14.788
where commencement was held?

04:19.134 --> 04:19.294
No. I think it was outside. All right. In that era, 
many times they were held at the football stadium.

04:24.422 --> 04:24.682
Yeah. I think that's where it was. Every name was 
called. Every hand was shaken. Every hand was

04:28.849 --> 04:29.930
shaken. Even mine.

04:34.553 --> 04:44.049
What is it that builds this pride, this spirit, 
this feeling of Iagish?

04:46.453 --> 04:47.936
I think it starts at the beginning. And it builds as 
you go, as you see the things that happen and the

04:49.258 --> 04:55.008
things you do and the things they tell you. And it 
just gets stronger and stronger and stronger as

04:55.108 --> 05:00.257
you go. And even when you leave, it gets stronger 
when you see what it's done for you, what it's done

05:00.676 --> 05:06.624
for me. I don't know about everybody else.

05:11.881 --> 05:13.904
It's, you know, it's there. And you never thought 
about transferring anywhere else? No. I went to

05:18.429 --> 05:22.935
school one summer here just to get some extra so I 
could graduate with the class. You know, I was a

05:22.955 --> 05:25.598
spring, I was a frog. So I went to school and 
carried, I think, six or nine hours here and

05:25.638 --> 05:30.905
transferred them. And that way I graduated in June 
of 49 with the rest of the fish, you know. If you were

05:37.233 --> 05:39.576
a consultant today, to the leadership of A&M about 
A&M's future, what would you urge them to do? I

05:47.858 --> 05:53.264
don't keep up with it much, but I would say the way 
they're growing and everything is just keep doing

05:47.858 --> 05:53.264
what you're doing. You say the spirit's still 
there. It's just that many more people that are

05:56.908 --> 06:02.695
getting it, and it should be good for the country. I 
don't know of anything that they could do that

06:04.317 --> 06:06.939
would make it any better. It keeps growing. It 
keeps getting better. The spirit's still there. I

06:10.183 --> 06:12.205
don't know. If you could make a major gift to Texas 
A&M, Somebody walks up to you, hands you a check for

06:17.153 --> 06:21.699
a million dollars, and there's only one 
restriction. You must give it to Texas A&M. What

06:23.782 --> 06:26.005
would you want your gift used for?

06:32.434 --> 06:32.874
I don't know. I don't know. Just offhand, I'd say 
maybe set up a scholarship or two or three or four

06:34.176 --> 06:46.553
for troubled guys that could go there and be in the 
Corps and go through the Aggie system. I think it

06:53.004 --> 06:56.430
would- Now troubled, how do you mean by troubled? 
Well delinquents maybe, guys that maybe could

06:56.470 --> 07:12.237
have been good, guys that grew up without a father, 
all these people that I think A&M would really,

06:56.470 --> 07:12.237
really help. To what people related to A&M, 
students, faculty, or whatever, do you feel the

07:14.225 --> 07:21.748
most gratitude as you look back?

07:24.757 --> 07:25.900
To whom are you most grateful? Oh, my 
upperclassmen. Yeah, really and truly. And most

07:32.560 --> 07:39.310
of them were really good, I learned from them all, 
they all had good attitudes, and I always thought

07:32.560 --> 07:39.310
they were fair. Even when they were beating on me I 
thought I had it coming. I think my upperclassmen.

07:48.110 --> 07:50.212
All right, I've only got one more question. What 
have we not covered that we should have? Do you have

07:52.534 --> 07:56.818
any, had you thought of any stories or things you 
wanted to be sure to? No, no. The only thing, we

08:00.482 --> 08:08.189
didn't go into detail was my romance, you know, but 
I don't think that's relative to this, you know.

08:09.170 --> 08:15.957
All right, then the last question is, what 
feelings do you hold in your heart today for Texas

08:09.170 --> 08:15.957
A&M?

08:19.582 --> 08:22.747
mostly gratitude for what it did for me.

08:30.939 --> 08:33.903
I don't do much to show it. I do the silver thing 
every year. And that's it. That's all I do. But I

08:42.215 --> 08:48.745
feel gratitude.

08:51.003 --> 08:53.954
Just thank the Lord every day that something took 
me there. You know, I don't know what. But that's

08:58.331 --> 09:00.339
it. That's a good ending.
