WEBVTT

00:02.512 --> 00:04.535
Slick tongue, too, what I mean.

00:04.555 --> 00:09.502
He was a rapid-fire lecturer.

00:10.944 --> 00:14.489
And, oh, I don't know, this and that.

00:14.509 --> 00:18.615
And in no way did it meant that he was slick to put one over him.

00:18.635 --> 00:20.357
Oh, no, no, no, no.

00:20.377 --> 00:20.978
Never that.

00:21.699 --> 00:26.646
All of our faculty back in those days were rock-solid people.

00:26.626 --> 00:31.972
While we're on nicknames, what were some of the other faculty nicknames in vet medicine in that era?

00:33.273 --> 00:36.957
Oh, you know, they didn't give that many then.

00:38.879 --> 00:39.980
Middleiff was Dr. John?

00:40.000 --> 00:45.366
Dr. John and then A.A.

00:46.207 --> 00:51.993
Leonard and Rusty Beamer and Pappy Burns.

00:53.254 --> 00:53.895
What about Turk?

00:53.915 --> 00:54.736
Did he have one?

00:54.896 --> 00:55.637
No.

00:55.617 --> 00:56.759
Just R.D.

00:56.859 --> 00:57.320
Turk.

00:57.340 --> 01:01.448
I've not heard of one for him.

01:01.648 --> 01:03.631
They just didn't have a whole lot.

01:03.652 --> 01:07.559
And then by the time you're a faculty member, they stopped creating them, didn't they?

01:08.360 --> 01:09.141
Did you have a nickname?

01:11.886 --> 01:12.347
Yeah.

01:14.291 --> 01:15.172
Silver Fox.

01:15.453 --> 01:15.994
Silver Fox.

01:16.014 --> 01:16.395
That's right.

01:16.415 --> 01:16.936
That's right.

01:17.296 --> 01:17.777
Why?

01:17.858 --> 01:18.639
I don't know.

01:18.819 --> 01:20.822
I guess I grayed when I was early.

01:21.082 --> 01:22.564
Was your hair, was it already?

01:23.025 --> 01:25.008
Yeah, I grayed when I was 35 or 40.

01:26.450 --> 01:28.152
So, I don't know.

01:28.172 --> 01:31.416
I was always called a silver fox.

01:31.436 --> 01:35.081
What, in fact, what did those nicknames mean?

01:36.083 --> 01:38.466
Well, usually the nickname was

01:39.104 --> 01:49.241
was applied with the idea that a common honor, strangely enough.

01:49.362 --> 01:50.504
I think so.

01:50.804 --> 01:52.968
It wasn't a derogatory thing at all.

01:53.128 --> 01:53.909
It was a warm.

01:54.250 --> 01:57.656
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

01:59.098 --> 02:04.808
Because you know better than I that elsewhere on the campus, some of them didn't sound complimentary.

02:04.788 --> 02:06.611
but in fact, they really were.

02:06.971 --> 02:07.672
Oh, yeah.

02:07.692 --> 02:12.059
Like in history, we had Notes Nance, Ivy League Taylor.

02:12.560 --> 02:14.022
Yeah, Ivy League Taylor.

02:17.708 --> 02:22.375
The man that I succeeded in teaching Southern history was Red Ass Bass.

02:22.422 --> 02:24.725
because he was kind of grumpy.

02:24.846 --> 02:25.567
I had him.

02:26.088 --> 02:27.470
Screaming Al Nelson.

02:29.072 --> 02:30.815
Step and a half had you.

02:30.915 --> 02:42.212
Blue Book Benton in government because you took your tests only in a Blue Book and they were feelings of warmth.

02:43.794 --> 02:49.763
Did I already ask, did anybody give you any guidance, direction or anything as a new faculty member?

02:49.743 --> 02:50.844
None whatsoever.

02:50.884 --> 02:52.025
Things to do or not to do?

02:52.706 --> 03:03.535
As your early years were moving forward, to whom did you turn for advice if you needed to find out how to do something, how to get it done?

03:03.555 --> 03:05.477
Oh, I usually went to Ed McMurray.

03:06.578 --> 03:18.248
Ed had taught me physiology, and he moved down to the assistant to the dean when I came aboard, and so

03:18.228 --> 03:34.600
I would go to Ed and if I had something I couldn't understand by reading it, but nearly all of my materials and everything were just self-taught.

03:35.913 --> 03:39.036
And as far as you, you were a 12-month employee.

03:39.557 --> 03:45.342
Was any of your salary from Experiment Station, or was it all?

03:45.823 --> 03:48.746
It was all on educational funds.

03:49.266 --> 03:56.334
I didn't get it on Experiment Station salary until later when Dr. Neville Clark came.

04:00.578 --> 04:04.722
What were your personal guidelines, your goals,

04:05.427 --> 04:09.096
hopes as a faculty member as you began?

04:09.156 --> 04:11.121
What were you dreaming of doing?

04:11.442 --> 04:14.369
Well, first of all, I didn't intend to stay.

04:16.054 --> 04:16.635
I only

04:17.898 --> 04:26.570
consented to come for one year, September through June, that nine-month period.

04:27.872 --> 04:42.994
And Dr. Burns, I just, well, you couldn't find academic people at that time, and there wasn't anybody taking advanced, the veterinarians weren't taking advanced degrees and so forth.

04:42.974 --> 04:47.399
And I had worked as a student for Dr. Burns for two years.

04:48.941 --> 04:57.390
And I just, well, there weren't Dr. Burns and Dr. Dick Davis and myself.

04:57.450 --> 04:58.111
That was it.

04:59.152 --> 05:01.595
And I just couldn't see going off and leaving them.

05:01.715 --> 05:03.978
So I stayed on.

05:04.118 --> 05:07.682
I still practiced in the summers and

05:08.084 --> 05:15.012
Christmas holidays and times like that with the idea that I would return to practice.

05:16.053 --> 05:31.892
But one thing led to another and there's quite a history as to how I finally got off into academia and got excited about opportunities and so forth.

05:31.912 --> 05:32.573
Describe that.

05:33.262 --> 05:36.606
Well, that'd take a long time to describe that.

05:36.646 --> 05:37.827
Let's stop it right here.

05:37.887 --> 05:44.855
What was it that led you to decide to stay here?

05:45.916 --> 05:49.160
And when you made that decision, what were you dreaming of doing?

05:50.141 --> 05:56.468
I would like to put together a sequence of things that probably meant more to this college.

05:57.308 --> 06:06.620
perhaps this university than anything that's transpired before, and may never again.

06:07.421 --> 06:17.494
But to show you how important one individual with one small step

06:18.638 --> 06:21.641
can influence the whole system.

06:21.701 --> 06:28.749
And I'd like to go back to an individual called Ed McMurray, E.D.

06:28.789 --> 06:29.349
McMurray.

06:30.310 --> 06:39.300
He had been a retired warrant officer, came back, taught veterinary physiology, went down as Dr. Price as assistant to the dean.

06:40.961 --> 06:42.503
And in the summer,

06:42.483 --> 07:06.567
of 1959 or 60, he came by my office, which, not air conditioned, but anyhow, he came by and said he was going to Baylor College of Medicine to take a summer course in physiology.

07:07.542 --> 07:11.250
And I didn't think anything about it at that time.

07:12.593 --> 07:25.500
So he went down to Baylor for, I believe then it was eight weeks summer course in teaching physiology and was introduced to

07:25.480 --> 07:35.510
a thing called a physiograph, which was an ultramodern transducer system for recording physiologic data.

07:35.530 --> 07:49.604
The head of the department at that time was Dr. Hebel Hoff, and his assistant department head was a person named Les Geddes, who was an engineer physiologist.

07:49.624 --> 07:55.150
Dr. Hoff was an MD, PhD physiologist from Harvard.

07:55.130 --> 07:59.435
And so Dr. McMurray went to that summer course.

08:00.456 --> 08:10.328
And back in those days, it took a lot of boldness to go off to do something like that.

08:10.488 --> 08:19.298
I mean, man, he didn't have time and any educational

08:19.885 --> 08:31.062
opportunities above the DVM were seldom taken, and so he went down to Baylor and took that summer course.

08:32.645 --> 08:43.682
And while I'm talking about Dr. McMurray, just as a sideline, he's really also the father of the biomedical sciences program at Texas A&M, which is now the largest

08:43.780 --> 08:46.845
undergraduate program, I think, in the university.

08:47.746 --> 08:52.053
And with time, I'd like to come back to that and expand on it.

08:53.195 --> 09:10.243
But Dr. McMurray came back very enthused from his summer training about new instrumentation, new ideas, new thoughts, and of course the Texas Medical Center being the largest

09:10.696 --> 09:33.312
self-contained medical center in the world now contains two medical schools, Baylor College of Medicine and the University of Texas, a UT Dental School, MD Anderson Hospital, about ten teaching hospitals, and the Veterans Administration, a dental school, a nursing school, a rehabilitation center,

09:33.292 --> 09:35.676
everything that you can think of.

09:36.718 --> 09:48.057
He came back from that course and that environment and insisted that I go take that course the next summer.

09:48.077 --> 09:52.865
And I told him, well, if I'm still here, I'll make an application.

09:54.608 --> 09:56.852
So I made an application to go

09:57.052 --> 10:02.157
to Baylor and take the summer course in about 1960.

10:04.519 --> 10:12.266
And I lived there in Houston and came back and forth on weekends to see my family.

10:13.467 --> 10:23.937
But Dr. Hebel Hoff, who was, as I say, an MD, PhD, and medical historian,

10:23.917 --> 10:28.846
and Dr. Geddes, who was an electrical engineer, Ph.D.

10:30.008 --> 10:36.619
physiologist, were so exciting in their presentation and what they had us do.

10:36.660 --> 10:42.971
We went to the class all morning and lectures and all afternoon in labs.

10:43.231 --> 10:48.220
And students, former medical students, etc., would come back

10:48.638 --> 10:51.724
and just fill the aisles just to hear Dr. Hoff.

10:52.526 --> 10:55.913
And then we had a noon lecture on medical history every day.

10:57.897 --> 11:04.791
And so I came back from that with a vision of what

11:05.530 --> 11:10.055
academia can be and what medicine can be and things to do.

11:10.075 --> 11:15.842
One of the little side lights is I came back.

11:15.962 --> 11:20.968
I had seen an overhead transparency.

11:21.428 --> 11:24.072
Dr. Hoff used it.

11:24.232 --> 11:30.559
And nobody at Texas A&M University had ever used an overhead projector or transparency before.

11:30.539 --> 11:53.458
And so I brought that back as one of my teaching tools, and I had a real difficult time persuading my department head to buy an overhead projector, and even more so in buying transparencies, because they cost about $25 a box of 20 transparencies or something.

11:53.438 --> 12:01.147
But for us, it revolutionized teaching methodology at that time, kind of like PowerPoint does now, I guess.

12:02.428 --> 12:06.593
And that was just a sidelight that I brought back from Baylor.

12:07.654 --> 12:21.150
But I came back, and I was teaching, and I got a call from Dr. Hoff wanting to know if I would come to Baylor

12:21.822 --> 12:24.548
and set up their laboratory animal program.

12:25.890 --> 12:30.600
At that time, there wasn't any laboratory animal programs per se to speak of.

12:30.720 --> 12:35.891
And so I said, well, I can't come until June if I come.

12:36.011 --> 12:38.937
And so he said, well, we're going to pay you.

12:40.486 --> 12:56.205
we're going to give you $1,000 a month, $12,000 a year, which was considerably more, twice or more than I was making, to come down here, set the program up, and we'll also let you work on your doctorate or PhD degree.

12:57.747 --> 13:03.493
So I said, well, let me see what I can arrange and if I can get leave from A&M.

13:03.513 --> 13:06.477
And so at that time you had to go to the

13:07.047 --> 13:18.064
all the way to the Regents to get leave absence, and so Dr. Burns was nice enough to get me at leave absence to go to Baylor, supposedly on a two-year jump.

13:19.226 --> 13:34.489
So I went down and began setting up this program, and being the first veterinarian in the Texas Medical Center, and there was no formal training in laboratory animal medicine, I did not know where to start.

13:35.026 --> 13:35.607
really.

13:35.667 --> 13:48.833
And so I knew the military had some programs in lab animal medicine, and so I went and visited with Dr. Hummer at Brooks Air Force Base and learned what I could about

13:49.117 --> 14:01.750
Lab Animal Medicine, and then after I got started, I realized there was no organization for Lab Animal Medicine, so there was one located up in the northeast.

14:02.431 --> 14:16.626
And so I called them and they said, yeah, we have two regional laboratory animal medicine associations, one in the northeast and one in the northwest.

14:16.606 --> 14:19.121
I said, well, I'd like to do something in Texas.

14:19.181 --> 14:22.802
We don't have any access to information.

14:23.558 --> 14:26.641
And he said, well, these are usually regional things.

14:26.801 --> 14:38.152
And so, but he said, if you can find 60 veterinarians showing any type of interest, we'll make Texas a branch, a laboratory animal branch.

14:38.232 --> 14:49.463
So I got ahold of Dr. Flowers here at Texas A&M, had all the veterinary faculty and the veterinarians that we could collect in the state come here for a meeting and sign a petition.

14:51.005 --> 14:53.447
And we got awarded

14:54.305 --> 14:57.291
Laboratory Animal Medicine Branch for the state of Texas.

14:57.311 --> 14:58.314
And that was about when?

14:59.035 --> 15:04.146
That was probably in 1963 or 4.

15:04.186 --> 15:13.326
And that, and Texas still stands alone as a branch of its own.

15:13.981 --> 15:18.167
Of course, laboratory-owned medicine has advanced so much.

15:18.888 --> 15:27.220
Shortly after that, we began training all the veterinarians in the Air Force in laboratory-owned medicine.

15:27.240 --> 15:35.932
They would come here and take basic training, and then they'd go back to Brooks and do a research problem.

15:35.952 --> 15:38.976
But anyhow, I went down.

15:39.800 --> 15:41.942
took over a laboratory animal program.

15:44.085 --> 15:48.530
We had everything, all kinds of animals.

15:48.730 --> 15:59.763
Facilities were very poor, but at that time Dr. DeBakey was using something like four or five thousand dogs a year in experimental surgery.

15:59.803 --> 16:09.013
So we had a large contingency of dogs, and then that

16:09.415 --> 16:12.158
golly, this just leads on for one thing or another.

16:12.439 --> 16:13.260
I hadn't been there long.

16:13.300 --> 16:31.583
They wanted me to go set up a breeding colony for dogs with the prison system because they could see that dogs were going to become difficult to acquire for experimentation.

16:32.745 --> 16:38.612
So as a satellite, again, I went down to Huntsville with a doctor

16:39.132 --> 16:42.797
Redwire, who was a psychiatrist

16:43.267 --> 16:51.856
who handled all the rich people's psychiatric cases and lawsuits and everything else.

16:51.876 --> 16:55.100
And Houston was worth many, many dollars.

16:55.120 --> 17:00.325
But he, up in age, had taken over a consultant of the prison system.

17:02.047 --> 17:12.919
And Dr. Stanley Olson, who I'll come back to later, the dean of the college, asked me to go to Huntsville and meet the doctor at the wire to see about

17:14.182 --> 17:23.811
building an experimental breeding colony of dogs at the prison and let the prisoners take care of them.

17:23.851 --> 17:44.070
Dr. Dwyer, from their standpoint at the psychiatrist, was that he thought that if we had a breeding colony there, prisoners took care of these animals, that it would develop a human bond relationship that would engender them to be better

17:44.219 --> 17:46.704
as citizens once they were released from prison.

17:47.064 --> 17:53.136
And that was the carrot for the prison system.

17:53.176 --> 17:59.308
And the carrot for Baylor was that Dr. DeBakey and the surgeons would have dogs, a continual supply of dogs.

18:00.048 --> 18:15.745
I went there and built a breeding colony for one dollar a square foot because we used prison bricks and mortar and labor and built a huge breeding colony, a whole 700 dogs.

18:16.703 --> 18:22.209
and we were breeding them, and of course I had an interest in bird dogs, so I filled it with English pointers.

18:23.871 --> 18:33.963
And we must have had thousands and thousands of English pointers, but anyhow, that is still functional.

18:34.083 --> 18:43.133
I mean, it's still ongoing, but that was just a sidelight to the whole system, but that probably was the first

18:45.003 --> 18:50.310
organized human-animal bond program in the United States.

18:52.152 --> 18:56.037
While you were working so hard on that, what were your goals?

18:56.097 --> 18:57.559
What were you dreaming of doing?

18:57.659 --> 19:08.193
Well, I worked directly for Dr. Stanley Olson, who was dean at Baylor College of Medicine.

19:08.373 --> 19:14.841
He's the one that put me into that position as part of my

19:15.277 --> 19:18.022
job to get that started in Houston.

19:18.122 --> 19:36.998
At the same time, I was trying to improve the lab animal facilities in Houston, and so I put in, for example, a clinical laboratory so that the animals could be evaluated before they went on experimentation so that

19:37.484 --> 19:48.330
The doctors would know, especially heartworm, if they were going to do cardiovascular research, need to do blood workup and what have you to find out if they had heartworms.

19:48.410 --> 19:51.898
And I even developed a skin test for heartworms using.

19:52.452 --> 20:12.507
ground up heartworms and making a suspension so I could inject under the skin and if they had heartworms, adult heartworms, they would develop a severe whelp at the site of injection and immune response.

20:13.549 --> 20:17.295
So we could screen animals for research.

20:17.275 --> 20:18.536
That was one thing.

20:18.556 --> 20:24.462
And then I had an animal caretaker named Guy Fane that helped me.

20:24.522 --> 20:36.553
And then, too, we set up a program for training lab animal technicians for all the state and the country under the federal program.

20:37.413 --> 20:40.616
There weren't any lab animal technicians then.

20:40.636 --> 20:44.460
They used to hire people off the street, so we started a program for that.

20:45.120 --> 20:46.962
Were you planning to come back at the

20:47.212 --> 20:50.436
While you were doing that, were you clearly planning to come back here?

20:50.496 --> 20:53.320
Well, you know, I didn't know what I wanted to do.

20:53.340 --> 20:55.623
One thing just led to another.

20:56.484 --> 20:58.467
I could have stayed at Baylor.

20:58.547 --> 21:02.352
In fact, I was offered jobs at Baylor and MD Anderson Bowl.

21:03.554 --> 21:09.642
But I just, Dr. Olson,

21:10.128 --> 21:17.340
Stanley Olson and, of course, my major professor, Dr. Hoff, were just such outstanding people.

21:18.141 --> 21:30.661
But Dr. Olson called me one day and he said, I would like to see if A&M would be interested in setting up an Institute of Comparative Medicine.

21:32.264 --> 21:37.232
And I said, well, there's nothing for us to do but meet with the

21:37.212 --> 21:42.517
Veterinary College Executive Committee and Dean and try on the idea.

21:42.537 --> 21:48.884
So, Dr. Olson and I got in the car, his car, and came to College Station.

21:49.004 --> 21:57.873
And this is something because Dr. Olson was a renowned physician and dean and educator and everything.

21:58.394 --> 22:06.342
To get him to come down up to College Station, meet with a group of very conservative veterinary department heads,

22:06.862 --> 22:12.316
And at that time, no one had ever heard of comparative medicine.

22:14.622 --> 22:17.850
This all went back to Osler.

22:18.792 --> 22:24.181
whom you historians know, the man with the agenda of one medicine.

22:25.083 --> 22:29.530
He was a physician back in, I guess, 1600, 1700.

22:30.612 --> 22:32.335
But he believed in one medicine.

22:32.475 --> 22:38.084
So from that, Dr. Olson said, well, let's call it comparative medicine.

22:38.105 --> 22:42.572
So we came and talked to the executive committee one morning.

22:43.227 --> 22:47.011
and told them we'd like to set up an Institute of Comparative Medicine.

22:48.512 --> 22:50.874
There would be veterinarians located at Baylor.

22:51.975 --> 23:05.108
They would work with the College of Veterinary Medicine and we would identify animal models with spontaneous disease and other things that we could use between the two institutions.

23:06.509 --> 23:10.753
And you can imagine these conservative

23:10.733 --> 23:14.824
teacher, veterinary-oriented group of department heads.

23:15.686 --> 23:25.452
They thought about it, and so after a bit they said, well, you know, if y'all can find the money and you want to do it, well, we'll do it.

23:26.630 --> 23:30.536
And so that began what we call the Institute of Comparative Medicine.

23:30.836 --> 23:32.498
We got state funding for it.

23:33.179 --> 23:37.185
Dr. DeBakey went for us to get that funding.

23:38.827 --> 23:40.650
That was a trade-out situation.

23:41.952 --> 23:45.617
Mr. Rutter was to

23:45.597 --> 23:54.189
helped Dr. DeBakey get funding for Baylor College of Medicine, which was a private medical school.

23:55.911 --> 23:57.474
This is another sidelight.

23:58.635 --> 24:07.167
Early on, Dr. Rutter or Mr. Rutter and Abner McCall

24:07.703 --> 24:08.985
I was contacted.

24:10.266 --> 24:23.503
By being the first veterinarian and A&M person, I guess, kind of in the Texas Medical Center, everything that would happen in the medical center or relationships, I would get involved just because of that.

24:23.944 --> 24:32.715
But anyhow, they contacted me one day and Abner McCall said, let me give Baylor College of Medicine

24:33.455 --> 24:37.404
to the Texas A&M University's system.

24:38.467 --> 24:42.216
He said, we're putting $25,000 a year in the Baylor College of Medicine.

24:42.596 --> 24:44.140
That's strapping our budget.

24:44.744 --> 24:51.134
We're not seeing anything really out of it that helps us, Baylor-Waco.

24:52.276 --> 24:56.663
And so Abner McCall and Earl Rutter were very good friends.

24:56.924 --> 25:03.715
They got together, arranged for me to transfer Baylor College of Medicine to Texas A&M University.

25:03.695 --> 25:21.553
And everything was going very well until they got to the organizational structure and Baylor College of Medicine insisted that they retain their own board of directors.

25:21.573 --> 25:27.059
And General Rutter said you can't have two board of directors in the system.

25:27.479 --> 25:30.242
He's a straight line item.

25:30.222 --> 25:34.567
And so he declined.

25:34.988 --> 25:37.150
And this was about what year?

25:37.170 --> 25:47.742
That would have been in 1960, probably about 1967.

25:49.484 --> 25:51.507
And all of these discussions were private?

25:51.847 --> 25:53.689
Oh, yeah, that was all private stuff.

25:53.709 --> 25:55.211
And none of it was ever in the paper?

25:55.231 --> 25:57.073
Never in the paper, never recorded.

25:57.391 --> 26:10.749
And as far as you're aware, if the board of directors issue had been resolved, the Baylor College of Medicine would now be part of Texas University.

26:12.151 --> 26:17.678
But that did not come to be.

26:18.535 --> 26:31.832
working with Dr. Olson, going back to funding for the Institute of Comparative Medicine, and Dr. DeBakey, and I worked indirectly for Dr. DeBakey and Dr. Olson when I was at Baylor.

26:33.374 --> 26:39.482
Dr. DeBakey finally became President and Chancellor of the Medical Center.

26:39.502 --> 26:43.066
But there was a trade-out.

26:43.747 --> 26:44.408
He would

26:44.388 --> 27:06.008
help us get the money for the Institute of Comparative Medicine, which we set up offices at Baylor and hired five veterinarians and began that, if Mr. Rutter would help him get state funding for Baylor College of Medicine, which was a private institution.

27:05.988 --> 27:13.703
At that time, Baylor probably took somewhere around 85 or 90 percent of its students were outside the state of Texas.

27:14.524 --> 27:23.642
They recruited nationwide for students and had scholarships for a lot of them.

27:24.483 --> 27:34.882
So what they went to Austin and persuaded the legislature to pay a pro rata per student what they were paying for Texas other medical schools.

27:36.645 --> 27:45.040
And so that happened, and Baylor now is probably 15 percent out of state and 85 percent

27:45.020 --> 27:50.549
in-state and paying that per capita hid.

27:50.909 --> 27:54.796
So it worked out well for a bailer.

27:55.517 --> 28:06.074
And then the Institute of Comparative Medicine went along for about five or six years and was snuffed out on a line item.

28:07.315 --> 28:08.918
As a line item it was

28:08.898 --> 28:17.133
It was lined out when Dr. Jarvis Miller was president, and the governor called him.

28:17.835 --> 28:30.578
The only thing the governor could do to a budget was to attack line items, and A&M had several line items, and so they agreed that the Institute of Comparative Medicine would be one that could be sacrificed.

28:30.658 --> 28:32.121
This is the late 70s.

28:32.945 --> 28:36.629
Did the governor give any explanation as to why that one?

28:36.949 --> 28:38.571
We just had to cut so much money.

28:38.912 --> 28:39.252
Okay.

28:39.813 --> 28:42.556
So the institute lasted about 10 years.

28:43.417 --> 28:45.759
Well, probably, you know, I'd have to go back.

28:46.160 --> 28:47.741
It led to lots of other things.

28:49.203 --> 29:00.015
But we hired five or six veterinarians and a director and set them up inside of Baylor College of Medicine.

29:00.434 --> 29:18.774
and began to collect or to do research on animals, comparative animals and diseases and surgicals and heart transplants and heart, mechanical hearts and all that kind of thing.

29:21.097 --> 29:27.083
And that led to a real close relationship

29:27.383 --> 29:39.126
between Baylor College of Medicine and Texas A&M and A&M College of Veterinary Medicine.

29:39.146 --> 29:48.565
And that relationship has continued until the present, but there have been lots of other things that occur in between there.

29:49.220 --> 30:05.081
As a result, this all goes back to Ed McMurray, a summer course, development of Dr. Stanley Olson's great person idea of a comparative medicine institute.

30:05.261 --> 30:13.692
And then spinning out of that, Dr. Jack Kenny Williams,

30:15.258 --> 30:30.280
called me one day and said that he wanted Texas A&M University to have a medical school, or medical college, and he wanted Texas A&M University to have a college of law.

30:30.260 --> 30:35.387
and he called Dr. Winerti and myself together.

30:35.768 --> 30:48.325
Dr. Winerti I had put in touch with Baylor on a research project on using isotopes as diagnostics, etc.

30:48.646 --> 30:51.610
and he was overhead of the

30:51.590 --> 30:54.855
Activation Analysis Laboratory at that time.

30:54.935 --> 30:56.277
So that got him involved.

30:56.297 --> 31:02.307
We put in a big grant together on activation analysis, use of medicine.

31:02.747 --> 31:12.923
But that got him involved, so the president asked that Dr. Winery and I develop a medical school at Texas A&M.

31:14.017 --> 31:25.360
So we set about to do that, and he was going to bring a law school here, and set about to do that with
