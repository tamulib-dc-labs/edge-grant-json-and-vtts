WEBVTT

00:03.558 --> 00:04.459
at the university.

00:05.681 --> 00:12.931
And he believed in, you know, it's boys school and you're gonna have a dollar a week.

00:12.971 --> 00:14.433
That's what I had my freshman year.

00:14.613 --> 00:21.683
Do you have any recollection about what the total charge fee was for a semester when you started?

00:21.743 --> 00:25.028
No, but it was very modest.

00:25.268 --> 00:26.009
It was great.

00:26.249 --> 00:31.877
I know my father, he didn't push me at the college station, but I'm sure that was

00:32.498 --> 00:39.307
That was something to help because otherwise there'd been a fraternity and all of those things in Austin.

00:39.327 --> 00:43.332
Tell me about a football weekend.

00:43.352 --> 00:46.456
Well, I was, again, I was blessed.

00:46.736 --> 00:50.541
That was the year that we went undefeated and ended up number one.

00:50.581 --> 00:53.685
And those were great guys.

00:53.725 --> 00:55.167
We had a lot of them in the Corps.

00:55.287 --> 00:56.508
Kimbrough was in the Corps.

00:56.528 --> 00:59.312
Just any number of them were in the Corps.

00:59.332 --> 01:00.193
And Sibley.

01:00.983 --> 01:03.287
And I don't remember all of them.

01:03.907 --> 01:06.091
Many, many of them were in the Corps of cadets.

01:08.054 --> 01:10.738
By way of saying it was really a fine bunch of guys.

01:10.758 --> 01:13.322
They were great football players, but they were good guys.

01:14.323 --> 01:15.305
Nice fellas.

01:15.325 --> 01:20.853
Yeah, we had great weekends.

01:21.514 --> 01:24.279
We'd have the dances each Saturday night.

01:24.299 --> 01:27.143
Alright, was there a midnight yell practice then?

01:30.397 --> 01:33.922
a Friday night in the stadium like there is now?

01:33.942 --> 01:35.905
No, not in the stadium.

01:35.925 --> 01:38.308
But we did have a bonfire.

01:39.129 --> 01:39.470
Where was it?

01:40.451 --> 01:43.775
It was on what is now the... Drill field?

01:43.815 --> 01:44.917
Drill field.

01:44.937 --> 01:51.887
And what material went into the... Well, it was a lot of crates.

01:51.907 --> 01:55.652
The things were boxed in crates, wooden crates in those days.

01:57.074 --> 01:58.716
And the...

01:59.725 --> 02:05.433
The various stores in that area would begin to save them for us, and we'd start getting them together.

02:07.015 --> 02:08.637
You know, I just don't remember.

02:08.697 --> 02:12.222
There may have been some logs, but I just don't remember.

02:12.282 --> 02:15.807
We didn't have any way, really, of moving around, and we didn't have the equipment.

02:16.367 --> 02:20.032
How big were those trees there?

02:20.072 --> 02:23.076
No, the drill field, the trees growing around the drill field.

02:23.096 --> 02:23.577
Oh, my.

02:23.717 --> 02:24.298
They were...

02:24.869 --> 02:26.612
They weren't very big.

02:26.632 --> 02:27.734
No, they weren't very big.

02:27.914 --> 02:29.477
That's what I thought.

02:29.717 --> 02:32.542
Alright, then it's football game day.

02:32.602 --> 02:35.807
Describe that for me, for you as a member of the Corps.

02:36.168 --> 02:43.940
Well, of course, freshman, you still didn't have total freedom on Saturdays.

02:45.924 --> 02:49.830
And you sat at the very top, obviously.

02:50.755 --> 02:55.680
I don't, you know, and I can't remember whether we, I don't think we marched in those days.

02:55.841 --> 02:56.822
I don't think we did.

02:56.842 --> 02:57.583
I don't think you did either.

02:57.603 --> 02:58.283
I don't believe we did.

02:58.303 --> 02:59.625
Did y'all stand during the game?

02:59.825 --> 03:01.827
Oh, absolutely.

03:01.847 --> 03:02.408
Absolutely.

03:02.448 --> 03:03.509
We never sat down.

03:04.430 --> 03:07.594
And did you, that freshman year, did you ever have a date to a game?

03:09.095 --> 03:12.819
My freshman year, I don't think so.

03:12.839 --> 03:17.184
I think it was my sophomore, junior, and then from then on, I'd have dates.

03:17.204 --> 03:18.906
And of course, football weekends,

03:19.443 --> 03:22.166
We had two court trips each year.

03:22.506 --> 03:37.980
One year it would be Houston when we played Rice, and TCU in Fort Worth, we played TCU, and then of course Texas and Austin, and SMU in Dallas.

03:38.000 --> 03:42.084
And each year we had two court trips, and those were the fun weekends.

03:42.565 --> 03:43.746
Tell me about a court trip.

03:43.766 --> 03:44.807
How'd you get there?

03:44.827 --> 03:46.328
Well as a freshman,

03:46.561 --> 03:47.802
In those days, we hitchhiked.

03:47.822 --> 03:50.506
There just weren't any automobiles.

03:50.526 --> 03:53.049
And people were so good about picking us up.

03:53.669 --> 03:57.153
And I remember the TCU game in particular for two reasons.

03:57.234 --> 04:03.982
First of all, a flatbed truck came along, and about, I guess, 40 or 50 of us got on.

04:04.642 --> 04:05.523
It was so dangerous.

04:05.924 --> 04:07.546
You know, we didn't think about it in those days.

04:08.427 --> 04:10.549
But I'll tell you what, I got off the first time.

04:10.569 --> 04:11.671
He stopped before the world.

04:11.691 --> 04:12.872
I got off of that thing.

04:13.240 --> 04:14.661
which was on the outskirts.

04:14.721 --> 04:19.806
And from then on, I hitchhiked to get an automobile, which we did.

04:21.488 --> 04:28.074
And they issued us our woolens for the fall, winters.

04:29.135 --> 04:33.339
And it had to be 90 degrees in those stands.

04:33.379 --> 04:36.022
And of course, you're in the east stand, and the sun's coming.

04:36.042 --> 04:37.163
It was a beautiful day.

04:38.584 --> 04:39.645
It was something else.

04:39.665 --> 04:41.307
But it was a fabulous weekend.

04:41.540 --> 04:43.703
And we rode the train back.

04:43.823 --> 04:44.905
We didn't take the train up.

04:44.925 --> 04:46.708
We didn't have enough money to take the train up.

04:47.549 --> 04:50.253
So we hitchhiked up and we took the night train.

04:50.273 --> 04:51.935
Got him about midnight.

04:51.955 --> 04:55.841
And you know, during the course of the trip, you drop what they call handles.

04:55.861 --> 04:56.922
You don't have any handles.

04:56.942 --> 04:59.847
You do when you get together to march, obviously.

05:00.528 --> 05:03.312
When you break up, you're friends.

05:03.352 --> 05:05.014
I mean, you can do whatever you want to do.

05:05.054 --> 05:06.957
You're just Aggies, all Aggies.

05:07.645 --> 05:19.403
So on the train, I remember coming back, it was a real learning process for me, because two or three of the sophomores, we were having fun with them, and I mean, we'd just get along great.

05:19.423 --> 05:25.552
The minute that train stopped at College Station, fishing, bare my bag.

05:26.593 --> 05:33.223
From then on, boy, it was a different ball game, and that was part of the tradition at A&M.

05:33.323 --> 05:35.847
Off campus, friends, no problems,

05:36.603 --> 05:37.524
at that campus.

05:38.765 --> 05:42.028
Now, you marched on the court trips.

05:42.048 --> 05:43.149
Yes.

05:43.209 --> 05:46.112
Tell me where y'all marched in those four cities.

05:46.272 --> 05:49.996
Well, we'd go down the main street of every city.

05:51.578 --> 05:55.882
In Houston, it was Main Street, and I forget some of the other streets.

05:55.902 --> 05:58.504
And the people would turn out in that Aggie band.

05:59.445 --> 06:04.230
You must remember that war was beginning to

06:05.392 --> 06:06.654
show itself in Europe.

06:07.836 --> 06:12.664
And we were beginning to see that in 1940, 40, currently 41, 42.

06:13.705 --> 06:20.115
But even in 39 and 40, military was beginning to gain the notice.

06:20.135 --> 06:27.467
And I wore my uniform, I never, we had the privilege as a junior to wear civvies off campus,

06:28.409 --> 06:29.470
I never did it.

06:29.791 --> 06:32.734
I was so proud of my unit in particular when I got those boots.

06:32.754 --> 06:35.597
Well, I'd almost take a shower in those boots I was so proud of.

06:37.620 --> 06:40.623
Can you remember who won the Thanksgiving game in 1939?

06:40.703 --> 06:42.405
Oh, yes.

06:42.565 --> 06:44.928
I remember one of the trick plays.

06:44.948 --> 06:50.615
We had that hideout with old Smith and beat Texas at A&M.

06:50.635 --> 06:52.797
So we went, we didn't

06:53.047 --> 06:55.691
See, we didn't have a 13-point score on us that year.

06:55.711 --> 07:00.037
It was unbelievable that several of those records still stand at the NCAA.

07:00.558 --> 07:02.140
The next year, we were going to the Rose Bowl.

07:02.741 --> 07:03.542
That was in Austin.

07:04.704 --> 07:16.802
My father had a room up in the Stephen F. Austin and a suite, and all of my Houston buddies, my other buddies, we were to go up there after the game to celebrate, because we were going to win, obviously.

07:18.004 --> 07:20.387
Well, I mean, the first...

07:20.620 --> 07:26.067
pop Texas and takes that ball down there and it ends up being 7-0.

07:26.087 --> 07:28.830
Now if you look at those statistics, it's unbelievable.

07:28.850 --> 07:30.973
We marched up and down that field.

07:30.993 --> 07:36.941
We'd get the 11-yard line and those Longhorns would, whatever it took, they kept us out of there.

07:37.141 --> 07:40.926
And no question why we had a better team that day, but we didn't win.

07:40.966 --> 07:41.807
They won.

07:41.827 --> 07:47.554
And well, I don't know, maybe they did have a better team that day.

07:47.574 --> 07:50.037
What were other, tell me about some other

07:50.945 --> 07:55.552
student organizations, singing cadets, band, et cetera.

07:55.572 --> 07:56.874
Tell me about some of those others.

07:58.216 --> 08:02.683
Well, of course, the most active were your hometown.

08:02.764 --> 08:06.429
You had hometown clubs, like the Houston Week were organized.

08:06.550 --> 08:07.591
Dallas was organized.

08:07.992 --> 08:09.154
What did they do?

08:09.815 --> 08:11.357
Oh, they'd just get together.

08:11.998 --> 08:14.662
We had mother's clubs in those days.

08:16.085 --> 08:16.986
Mothers were very

08:17.675 --> 08:27.966
They were sort of the catalyst, you might say, to try to keep the boys together and would have things planned when we got back home to Houston.

08:28.727 --> 08:34.633
But you had an economics club and you had any number of engineers.

08:34.653 --> 08:36.515
You had your engineering clubs.

08:36.615 --> 08:38.777
Was there a singing cadet organization?

08:38.797 --> 08:39.998
There was a singing cadet.

08:40.259 --> 08:41.120
I think there was.

08:41.720 --> 08:42.501
I believe there was.

08:42.734 --> 08:47.019
And the band... Oh, the Aggieland band was, they were terrific.

08:47.760 --> 08:49.822
In fact, Buck Wires was a member of that.

08:52.485 --> 08:54.908
Alright, let's see.

08:55.008 --> 08:56.931
Now, let's go to the important subject.

08:57.611 --> 09:04.259
You arrive at A&M almost exactly at the time World War II breaks out in Europe.

09:04.279 --> 09:08.404
Tell me how this began to affect you and your classmates.

09:09.599 --> 09:12.643
You know, young men, that's the reason young men fight wars.

09:14.986 --> 09:16.908
It was exciting to us.

09:18.270 --> 09:35.150
And of course, we had a lot of military science, so that was part of our... And it was interesting because then, even then, they would begin to teach the tactics and the strategy being used by the Germans.

09:35.190 --> 09:39.235
The Germans set the pattern in the beginning.

09:40.767 --> 09:51.642
whether it was marched through France or in the lowlands, Netherlands and so forth, or whether it was finally when they struck Russia.

09:51.662 --> 09:54.165
We studied that, that was quite a thing.

09:54.185 --> 09:57.029
And in North Africa it was quite a thing.

09:57.049 --> 10:01.014
So we studied those pretty well.

10:01.094 --> 10:07.122
Now when the course in Pearl Harbor took place, I never forget my father and mother were there.

10:07.243 --> 10:08.344
I had two brothers.

10:09.151 --> 10:11.775
There were three of us at A&M at the same time, one year behind.

10:11.815 --> 10:16.722
When I was a senior, I had a brother who was a junior, and I had a brother who was a sophomore.

10:16.742 --> 10:18.705
All three of us finally ended up flying.

10:19.346 --> 10:23.051
And I lost my youngest brother, B-29s over in Japan.

10:24.012 --> 10:32.544
And my other brother was a B-29 commander in Montgomery, had his crew, and was ready to move out, and we dropped the first bomb.

10:32.604 --> 10:33.726
Of course, they stopped everything.

10:33.766 --> 10:37.892
And I was in the Pacific at that time.

10:39.728 --> 10:44.193
We discussed Japan, but that really isn't what we studied.

10:44.434 --> 10:45.775
We studied Europe.

10:47.557 --> 10:51.382
We were very, very aware of it and really kind of looked forward to it.

10:51.422 --> 10:52.623
I mean, we really did.

10:53.444 --> 10:57.750
Where were you when you heard the news on the first Sunday in December 1941?

10:57.770 --> 11:01.434
I started to tell you and I got off track.

11:02.395 --> 11:09.043
My father and mother were here and we would go park by those trees at the parade round.

11:09.800 --> 11:11.342
And they'd always bring something.

11:11.362 --> 11:24.103
They'd bring us soft drinks and sandwiches and cookies and brownies and things that would come from home knowing that we didn't have quite that good in the mess hall.

11:24.123 --> 11:27.128
And Dad always listened to the radio.

11:27.148 --> 11:29.051
Calvin Bourne, what was his name?

11:29.311 --> 11:29.652
HV.

11:30.112 --> 11:30.393
HV.

11:30.693 --> 11:33.057
Dad wouldn't miss a thing.

11:33.458 --> 11:40.207
So he's got the radio on and I think this was a time when he usually came on.

11:40.288 --> 11:40.568
He was.

11:40.968 --> 11:46.717
He was talking about the day's news and so forth.

11:46.737 --> 11:52.765
And he said, I've just been handed, hold on, hold on, I've just been handed something.

11:53.005 --> 11:58.513
I'm gonna read it as I'm looking at it now.

11:58.533 --> 12:02.098
Japan has attacked Pearl Harbor.

12:02.770 --> 12:07.836
I repeat, Japan has attacked Pearl Harbor.

12:07.916 --> 12:13.362
The details are sketchy, limited.

12:14.263 --> 12:19.429
However, we're told that it is a disaster.

12:19.449 --> 12:21.891
It is a very bad situation.

12:23.353 --> 12:26.777
And my mother just, she knew why the three of us were going.

12:28.879 --> 12:32.423
But she was very brave, very good about it.

12:33.567 --> 12:39.134
So then the rumors, the rumors then began, they were going to start taking us immediately.

12:39.154 --> 12:42.539
We weren't going to, here I am, what was I, a junior?

12:42.579 --> 12:44.501
41, what?

12:44.521 --> 12:44.742
39.

12:44.762 --> 12:50.069
40, 41, I was a junior.

12:50.089 --> 12:54.675
And rumors were, junior seniors will be out of here in a month.

12:54.955 --> 12:56.938
Well, that didn't take place.

12:57.819 --> 13:00.182
But a lot of boys would begin to leave right then.

13:00.787 --> 13:05.614
They'd left on their own car to join the Air Corps and others.

13:05.634 --> 13:18.032
And I asked my last year, General, who was the commanding general at Fort Hood?

13:18.072 --> 13:20.335
It was Cam Hood, no tank destroyer school.

13:21.277 --> 13:22.699
I'll think of it in a minute.

13:22.719 --> 13:28.988
And Aggie, he was the commanding general and his adjutant, Woody Varner,

13:29.457 --> 13:35.504
who was a cadet colonel while I was there, and there were just Aggies all through it.

13:36.385 --> 13:43.293
So I put in for the Tank Destroyer School, and I took 13 of us out of the whole bunch.

13:44.054 --> 13:48.899
And we heard rumors, you'll be a first lieutenant in six months, a captain in a year, and so forth.

13:49.680 --> 13:56.508
Well, it didn't quite happen that way, but I ended up, that's where I was commissioned at Tank Destroyer School.

13:57.109 --> 13:58.350
As the war began,

13:59.039 --> 14:04.445
for the United States, what did you and your contemporaries think was, who was going to win that war?

14:05.607 --> 14:06.748
Oh, there wasn't any question.

14:07.108 --> 14:07.969
There wasn't any question.

14:07.989 --> 14:08.930
The question was when.

14:09.851 --> 14:15.958
No, there was absolutely no question, anyone's mind, that we weren't going to repel and win.

14:16.019 --> 14:17.200
There's no question.

14:17.220 --> 14:21.205
Describe those who spoke out in opposition to the war.

14:22.426 --> 14:28.573
You know, that, I think the only people that I know of were in the East.

14:28.705 --> 14:30.267
There was some senator up there.

14:31.189 --> 14:35.295
I know that Kennedy's father was against it.

14:35.795 --> 14:40.041
But there was nobody at A&M that... No sir, never.

14:40.142 --> 14:41.383
Not to my knowledge, ever.

14:42.104 --> 14:48.273
And if anyone did it, they did it behind closed doors, because I never, we never.

14:48.293 --> 14:53.481
Right, and so the curriculum began to change in your military science classes.

14:54.389 --> 14:55.310
The subject matter.

14:55.330 --> 14:55.871
Yeah, that's what I mean.

14:55.891 --> 14:56.772
You're right, yes.

14:56.792 --> 15:13.036
What about any other changes that began... Well, Haskell, I think that there became a doubling of feeling as it relates to the importance of military.

15:13.116 --> 15:24.312
I think all of us, until the war, you know, it was a military school and we'd probably get our commission and serve and then become a reserve officer.

15:25.270 --> 15:30.217
After Pearl Harbor, there wasn't any question of what we were going to combat.

15:30.297 --> 15:31.599
We were part of it.

15:32.440 --> 15:34.903
So it was a very serious thing with us.

15:34.923 --> 15:44.076
As you look back on it, does it seem that there was less horseplay among the students after the war got started?

15:44.096 --> 15:46.580
Was it a more serious place?

15:46.600 --> 15:48.442
I don't think there's any question about it, yes.

15:49.023 --> 15:51.987
I think there was a maturation

15:52.658 --> 15:54.261
circumstance that took place.

15:54.321 --> 15:55.663
We all matured a little bit.

15:56.484 --> 16:06.239
I'd say within six months after Pearl Harbor, yeah, there was just a different, we were gonna go to war.

16:06.259 --> 16:19.160
Alright, so then you go through three years, three nine month years, or two nine month years, and tell me about that three semesters a year program.

16:19.180 --> 16:20.522
Yeah, see,

16:22.780 --> 16:43.147
In the fall of 1942, no, 41, let me see, 42, in the fall of, I guess it was 41, we went that semester, we went another semester in 42, and then 43, no, we went three.

16:44.449 --> 16:45.991
See, we never stopped, let me see.

16:47.153 --> 16:50.357
It was the fall semester, when we went in in September,

16:52.970 --> 16:55.192
We went straight through until we graduated.

16:56.113 --> 17:03.139
The last part, which would be, if we got out in 43, it was actually the end of 42, you might say.

17:03.660 --> 17:05.181
So beginning of September of 41.

17:05.201 --> 17:08.584
You went straight from moving?

17:08.604 --> 17:12.047
Straight through, and then got our degree.

17:12.588 --> 17:18.873
And as I stated earlier, we were the last class at A&M during that period to graduate as a class.

17:19.494 --> 17:22.757
The class of 44, 45, 46 were

17:23.227 --> 17:26.370
Totally different make-up style.

17:26.730 --> 17:37.561
Were there some folks that had been at A&M when you first arrived who that you knew were in the Philippines when the Japanese... Was it General Moore?

17:38.522 --> 17:39.583
General Moore.

17:39.603 --> 17:41.465
Tell me about him, as you would call him.

17:41.565 --> 17:42.967
Well, he was our commandant.

17:42.987 --> 17:43.887
What kind of man was he?

17:43.948 --> 17:45.789
Oh, I think he was a very fine man.

17:46.030 --> 17:51.495
I knew him.

17:51.897 --> 17:54.580
Uh, but I didn't know him intimately at all.

17:55.280 --> 17:59.024
He was, the commandant is, he's quite a fella.

17:59.524 --> 18:08.293
And uh, the 7,000 cadets, that's, and he was, he was that good, he was in Florida, he gave the command of Corregidor.

18:08.513 --> 18:16.741
Uh, let's see, I hear what, this is about Brian Field, but that's, that's after, after you.

18:16.821 --> 18:17.141
Yeah.

18:17.762 --> 18:21.465
Uh, alright, let's go back to hit, you did hitchhike some.

18:22.053 --> 18:22.694
Always.

18:22.794 --> 18:23.875
Tell me the routine.

18:23.915 --> 18:36.432
Where did a hitchhiker... Well, most of the time, the girls that I knew had gone to Texas, most of them, from Houston, my high school.

18:36.452 --> 18:46.104
And many, many times, we'd go over there on a Saturday and stay the weekend.

18:46.204 --> 18:50.971
Usually, I had friends over in fraternity houses, and they'd put me up.

18:50.991 --> 18:51.992
Where did you...

18:52.175 --> 18:56.320
Leaving College Station, where was the right place to go to get a ride?

18:56.340 --> 19:02.468
Well, I went through Hearn, and then where did I go?

19:02.789 --> 19:03.750
I had to get a map.

19:03.910 --> 19:09.918
But sometimes you went through Caldwell and Old Dime Bob, you know, up that way.

19:12.561 --> 19:14.764
How did you dress to get a ride?

19:14.784 --> 19:15.705
Always uniform.

19:16.466 --> 19:19.029
Always, never without a uniform.

19:19.050 --> 19:21.793
And I must say this, that my senior year,

19:22.803 --> 19:28.790
I was in Austin one or two weekends out of the month at least.

19:28.810 --> 19:38.320
In fact, Jack Nagel, who was one of the gale weeders that was killed in the world, a great guy, a good friend, he and I, we'd go during the week.

19:38.681 --> 19:45.368
We'd go in the afternoon, we'd get over there maybe 7 or 8 o'clock at night, we'd have a date.

19:46.276 --> 19:50.282
We'd start hit hikes about midnight, one o'clock.

19:50.302 --> 19:53.627
We'd get in maybe six, seven, eight o'clock the next morning.

19:53.647 --> 19:54.869
We did it many, many times.

19:55.470 --> 19:56.972
And never a problem?

19:57.412 --> 19:58.234
Never a problem.

19:58.254 --> 20:02.400
The only problem was it'd get cold in some of those spots.

20:02.760 --> 20:07.627
Now when you went home to Houston, how'd you get back and forth?

20:07.647 --> 20:08.168
On the train?

20:08.328 --> 20:08.729
On the train.

20:08.809 --> 20:10.011
Yeah.

20:10.211 --> 20:14.157
Your dad was very, very liberal about that.

20:15.166 --> 20:16.227
that I could come home.

20:16.547 --> 20:21.953
And he'd always put me on that sunbeam first class, always.

20:22.033 --> 20:23.454
I had my own seat, you know.

20:23.514 --> 20:29.140
That was one thing that I always felt, man, I'm really in great shape here.

20:29.660 --> 20:32.903
But as soon as I'd get to College Station, it was the melting pot.

20:32.923 --> 20:35.766
Now, did any of your buddies have a car?

20:36.527 --> 20:37.608
And if so, what were the rules?

20:37.628 --> 20:38.749
We didn't have a car.

20:39.310 --> 20:42.793
We didn't have a car in our outfit until

20:44.900 --> 21:08.022
my sophomore year, a junior had a car and one of our sophomores, a fellow from El Paso, Chico Manuelo Lozano, and he had a car and we would ride with him.

21:08.558 --> 21:11.301
Let's digress on that.

21:11.902 --> 21:19.651
Tell me how you think the student body reacted to Hispanics, Asian.

21:21.633 --> 21:26.239
How was Lozano treated, as far as you know?

21:26.259 --> 21:27.860
Fine.

21:27.880 --> 21:33.367
We had one of my best friends was a Jew from Palestine.

21:33.387 --> 21:34.448
Great, great guy.

21:35.508 --> 21:37.130
Some of the fellows were kind of hard.

21:37.230 --> 21:38.872
They'd call him and, hey, Jew!

21:40.113 --> 21:41.054
But we took it.

21:41.535 --> 21:42.176
We loved him.

21:42.276 --> 21:43.317
He knew we liked him.

21:43.457 --> 21:46.381
It was just sort of just tough boy stuff.

21:46.401 --> 21:50.245
But he realized that it was strictly a fun deal.

21:51.166 --> 21:53.349
And Chico got along with him fine.

21:53.389 --> 21:54.510
No problem.

21:54.530 --> 21:55.471
I must say this.

21:55.571 --> 21:57.694
There isn't any question.

21:57.714 --> 22:00.377
And this is something I learned.

22:00.397 --> 22:04.722
I learned that it really didn't make any difference where you came from.

22:05.393 --> 22:10.800
who your folks were, what your standing in your high school class was.

22:10.820 --> 22:14.585
When you hit A&M, you all got a start right there.

22:14.646 --> 22:17.750
The gun fired that moment.

22:17.770 --> 22:23.858
You set your own pattern, your own pace, your own goals, your own accomplishments.

22:23.878 --> 22:29.005
Ended making us where you were from and that went from everyone.

22:29.491 --> 22:32.114
Latin America made no difference.

22:32.134 --> 22:34.057
Honest to goodness, it did.

22:34.557 --> 22:35.458
I think that is true.

22:37.080 --> 22:41.366
Fred McClure, first black student body.

22:41.386 --> 22:42.347
Well, that came later.

22:42.367 --> 22:43.348
No, I know it.

22:43.388 --> 22:44.830
But he said same for him.

22:44.890 --> 22:49.175
Hector Gutierrez from Laredo, first non-Anglo Corps commander.

22:49.235 --> 22:50.056
Same thing.

22:50.437 --> 22:53.441
And I tell people, you're either an Aggie or you're not.

22:53.461 --> 22:55.363
If you're an Aggie, we don't need to ask him.

22:55.383 --> 22:55.783
Exactly.

22:55.803 --> 22:57.085
That's precisely correct.

22:57.672 --> 23:00.295
There are other fine Jewish fellas.

23:00.315 --> 23:04.540
Were there any international students that you remember in that era?

23:05.241 --> 23:06.762
I'm certain there were.

23:06.862 --> 23:09.525
I think we were getting Dominican Republic people then.

23:10.787 --> 23:13.710
We had some Mexican people there.

23:14.611 --> 23:20.858
But not anywhere near the mix that you have today.

23:20.998 --> 23:21.719
Not at all.

23:22.160 --> 23:22.961
Alright.

23:23.762 --> 23:25.924
Can you generalize about

23:26.714 --> 23:35.348
geographically and economically where the students came from in your day?

23:35.368 --> 23:38.513
I think it was a grand mix.

23:38.693 --> 23:45.645
Some of my friends from Houston, they could have gone anywhere they wanted to, a foreign school if they'd chosen.

23:45.665 --> 23:50.072
Jack Roach, Roach Motor Company in Houston, just one after another.

23:50.232 --> 23:53.397
One of Umbel Oil's top executives.

23:53.697 --> 23:58.363
was a classmate of mine in the Calvary.

23:59.285 --> 24:01.708
And you had boys who had to wait tables.

24:02.189 --> 24:04.292
You had the full spectrum.

24:04.312 --> 24:18.932
But when you put that uniform on, and you were together, and you were in class, and you walked together, and you ate together, the only class distinction was freshman, sophomore, junior, and senior.

24:19.513 --> 24:21.495
There was less and less as you advanced.

24:21.515 --> 24:23.518
There was less and less juniors and seniors

24:24.359 --> 24:27.482
They didn't have, you know, you're there.

24:27.602 --> 24:30.565
Once you're a junior, you're above it all.

24:31.226 --> 24:32.887
Where did an Aggie locate it?

24:32.907 --> 24:34.088
You told me about Mabel.

24:34.829 --> 24:37.111
In fact, where did Aggies locate dates?

24:38.873 --> 24:40.895
Well, if you were lucky, I was.

24:40.995 --> 24:42.256
I had some Brian friends.

24:42.857 --> 24:51.865
And so I would have, now we would have girls, after my sophomore and junior year, we'd have girls up in Houston for dances.

24:51.985 --> 24:52.746
We'd put them up.

24:53.317 --> 24:58.284
We had the Aggieland Inn in those days, which was a nice place.

25:00.066 --> 25:03.571
You had to do a lot of prior planning to get a room for your day.

25:04.192 --> 25:07.917
Sometimes we had to double up, but we'd take care of it.

25:07.937 --> 25:15.208
And I think one of the big, I think it's either the junior prom or the senior ring dance, one of them.

25:15.228 --> 25:18.312
I think we made a dormitory.

25:18.713 --> 25:21.537
I think we did, available for the ladies and mothers.

25:21.557 --> 25:22.298
I think we did.

25:22.739 --> 25:23.039
I think we did.

25:23.059 --> 25:24.482
Tell me about those events.

25:25.103 --> 25:26.044
Where were they held?

25:26.284 --> 25:27.406
Sabisa Hall.

25:27.426 --> 25:35.218
All of the events, even though we, Duncan, all of those matters took place in Sabisa.

25:35.558 --> 25:39.424
Best dances, in those days we'd get the best bands in the country.

25:39.444 --> 25:47.556
Russ Morgan, Jimmy Darcy, just one after another would come.

25:48.346 --> 25:50.288
And I had a weak feeling, didn't you?

25:50.308 --> 25:51.609
And the girls loved it.

25:51.629 --> 26:00.997
I don't care if they were from Austin, Fort Worth of Dallas, would come to an A&M dance in Sabisa Hall because the fellas would just cut in.

26:01.097 --> 26:04.380
I mean, they were going to get rushed off their feet.

26:04.480 --> 26:08.184
And after all, that's a very flattering circumstance for a lady.

26:09.725 --> 26:14.750
So they may have, when they got back to Austin, talked a little deeper.

26:14.790 --> 26:15.931
They had a good time here.

26:15.951 --> 26:16.771
I met my wife.

26:16.791 --> 26:17.492
I met Martha.

26:18.130 --> 26:20.092
She was at the University of Texas.

26:20.273 --> 26:20.974
Tell me about that.

26:21.234 --> 26:25.659
Martha was at the University of Texas, and she was a member of their glee club.

26:25.679 --> 26:33.529
They came over to have a concert, you might say, and they had an old guy, the old one.

26:34.370 --> 26:36.332
I think, what did they call that?

26:36.673 --> 26:38.635
The old guy at home.

26:38.655 --> 26:45.724
And she said, not too many showed up, but they had a nice dinner.

26:45.744 --> 26:48.087
I was going with Alice Sue Roman,

26:48.556 --> 26:50.178
for Bryan.

26:50.198 --> 26:55.683
She was president of Martha's sorority and Martha was her little sister.

26:55.703 --> 26:59.146
So she asked her to stay with her that weekend.

26:59.166 --> 27:02.289
And I had a date with Alice Sue at the dance.

27:03.530 --> 27:08.054
And I met Martha and I found an intermission.

27:08.194 --> 27:11.157
I worked so I had her at intermission.

27:11.197 --> 27:13.840
She was with some other Aggie women.

27:13.860 --> 27:15.061
Now this was what year for you?

27:16.242 --> 27:17.263
This was my

27:18.138 --> 27:22.102
She was a sophomore.

27:22.122 --> 27:23.223
She was two years old.

27:23.243 --> 27:26.807
So, your life was getting serious in more ways than one?

27:26.927 --> 27:32.533
Well, strangely enough, we didn't see each other again until a chance meeting in a taxi.

27:33.033 --> 27:34.875
I'd already gone then to flying.

27:34.955 --> 27:37.237
I had my wings and I was getting ready to go overseas.

27:38.759 --> 27:40.961
And most days you shared taxis.

27:40.981 --> 27:42.323
You never had one by yourself.

27:43.103 --> 27:44.044
And we made a stop.

27:44.124 --> 27:46.727
I was going to

27:47.230 --> 27:52.397
pick up a date, as a matter of fact, which was two doors down from her sorority house.

27:52.457 --> 27:53.819
And she got in and it was true.

27:53.899 --> 27:55.140
And I said, you know, I know you.

27:55.160 --> 27:57.644
And she said, I think I know you too.

27:58.465 --> 28:00.608
And I got off at her sorority house.

28:01.689 --> 28:07.477
She robbed me of my gum, my cigarettes, everything that I had, you know, because they couldn't get them in those days.

28:07.497 --> 28:09.639
And we, then we picked up.

28:09.760 --> 28:11.502
At that point on that, it was serious.

28:11.642 --> 28:14.706
Oh yeah, within two months I'd given her a ring.

28:15.023 --> 28:20.471
Right now, when young ladies came, you said they stayed at the Aggieland Inn and other places.

28:21.412 --> 28:31.988
And how much drinking and any other wild behavior was there in an Aggie dance?

28:32.509 --> 28:33.430
There just wasn't any.

28:34.392 --> 28:38.518
I mean, really, I didn't drink in those days.

28:38.778 --> 28:41.062
I came from a family that didn't drink.

28:41.082 --> 28:44.727
Dad, or maybe he'd take us to...

28:44.808 --> 28:49.915
used to club and he'd have a scotch and soda.

28:49.935 --> 28:50.616
One drink.

28:50.636 --> 28:51.978
Just be social, that's all.

28:52.038 --> 28:54.942
My mother, I don't know, I don't think she drank anyway.

28:54.962 --> 28:59.528
So I didn't really know about it and you couldn't get booze.

28:59.628 --> 29:00.509
I didn't have it.

29:00.569 --> 29:04.294
You had to go all the way to the Brazos River to get it and see if it was dry.

29:04.575 --> 29:07.879
I was going to ask, was hard liquors going when you were?

29:08.281 --> 29:08.621
Beer.

29:08.862 --> 29:09.122
Beer.

29:09.342 --> 29:12.605
No, but the place down the... Oh yeah, oh yeah, Hard Liquors.

29:12.925 --> 29:14.087
Oh yeah, absolutely.

29:14.107 --> 29:14.867
Now what did he say?

29:14.887 --> 29:16.809
The best place for me was Franklin's.

29:16.849 --> 29:20.072
Franklin's out on... Oh, that was a great place.

29:20.152 --> 29:21.474
Where was that?

29:21.494 --> 29:23.075
Well, it's on the highway.

29:23.716 --> 29:24.216
Let's see.

29:24.236 --> 29:26.278
It was right in front of the vet school.

29:26.298 --> 29:27.239
What was that event?

29:27.299 --> 29:29.361
Oh, you're talking about Whiskey Bridge.

29:29.381 --> 29:30.602
Go on a snook.

29:31.283 --> 29:34.045
Oh yeah, but that's where the booze was, on the other side of the bracket.

29:34.065 --> 29:35.207
But no, this was an easy place.

29:35.247 --> 29:37.849
Franklin's had a... What you could do...

29:38.352 --> 29:41.497
You could bring your booze in and they'd fix mixes.

29:41.517 --> 29:44.922
You could do that, but you couldn't buy any whiskey.

29:45.523 --> 29:46.464
They just wouldn't sell it.

29:46.484 --> 29:47.526
They tolerated it.

29:47.546 --> 29:49.669
You could drink it once you got it.

29:49.689 --> 29:50.931
But none of us drank it.

29:51.071 --> 29:51.752
We wouldn't really.

29:51.852 --> 29:58.923
I don't ever remember anyone in my outfit really drinking.

29:59.323 --> 30:00.725
We'd go to Austin.

30:00.745 --> 30:02.408
In those days, all you could get was rum.

30:02.468 --> 30:04.952
You'd kind of go to Cuba Leavers, I remember that.

30:05.452 --> 30:07.836
And maybe you'd party and you'd have some drinks,

30:08.272 --> 30:10.575
We never drank in the dormitory.

30:10.595 --> 30:13.338
In fact, we weren't supposed to, and we didn't.

30:13.499 --> 30:15.401
We did not break that rule.

30:15.421 --> 30:17.203
Now, I'm gonna ask this one with a straight face.

30:17.844 --> 30:21.288
What did you and your buddies know about drugs?

30:21.308 --> 30:22.490
Absolutely nothing.

30:22.510 --> 30:23.671
Didn't even know the words.

30:23.731 --> 30:28.517
Didn't even know what it... Well, you know, it's like it's one of these very popular songs.

30:28.557 --> 30:29.559
Who was it?

30:30.179 --> 30:34.965
One of the great composers up there in the East.

30:34.985 --> 30:37.148
And one of the great songs is...

30:37.718 --> 30:41.962
something about, it wasn't cocaine, what was it?

30:42.423 --> 30:44.024
Something like that.

30:44.044 --> 30:46.126
And it didn't mean anything to anyone.

30:46.146 --> 30:46.547
I mean, who?

30:47.127 --> 30:47.988
Didn't know?

30:48.008 --> 30:51.652
Oh yeah, this was back in the thirties, didn't mean anything.

30:52.293 --> 31:00.241
How much interaction did you as a student have with either the College Station community or the Bryan community?

31:02.042 --> 31:06.747
Well, your interaction actually was a function strictly of

31:07.351 --> 31:18.671
If you went to one of the churches in Bryan, obviously you'd meet some of the people that way and you'd have to almost do that.

31:19.132 --> 31:25.343
I don't know of any other way to do it except do friends, but I had friends and I was able to meet none of the family.

31:25.363 --> 31:28.148
Did you go downtown Bryan often to buy anything?

31:29.030 --> 31:30.793
No, no never.
