00:02.528 --> 00:06.152
If it's coming through before we... We're testing 
first. One, two, three, four. One, two, three,

00:07.353 --> 00:08.514
four. Try a sentence. We're testing. One, two, 
three, four. One, two, three, four. This is warm

00:14.160 --> 00:24.050
Friday, August 11, the year 2000, and I'm on the 
ninth floor of the Rudder Tower. I have the delight

00:24.610 --> 00:31.337
of chatting with Jeanette Ferris about student 
years just a few years ago. To introduce yourself

00:32.363 --> 00:40.753
to this process, Jeanette, talk about, describe 
family, growing up, where, when. Tell us about

00:40.813 --> 00:45.038
yourself before you arrived in College Station. 
In the 50s? I'm a product of Breckenridge High

00:49.984 --> 00:58.354
School, Breckenridge, Texas, famous buckaroos, 
green and white, big football town. My family

00:59.043 --> 01:08.057
consisted of my husband, Don, and two children, 
Donna K, and Randy, who were Donald was born while

01:08.510 --> 01:13.457
we were at Texas A&M during 1956 through the years 
through 60. My son was born after I departed from

01:14.218 --> 01:17.963
here in the year 1960. And I was a student wife while 
my husband was pursuing a petroleum engineering

01:19.505 --> 01:25.854
degree. But let's back up. Your parents, where did 
they grow up? My mother grew up in Oklahoma, my

01:31.021 --> 01:42.418
father grew up in Georgia, and met in Texas, and I 
spent my entire childhood in Breckenridge,

01:31.021 --> 01:42.418
Texas, living there, and my father was a rancher. 
My mother kept the house, and she died when I was a

01:42.459 --> 01:53.536
teenager, and we did ranching and all the chores 
that ranching requires. And you finished high

01:54.477 --> 01:56.901
school in what year? 1950, salutatorian of my 
class. And then you got to College Station? 1956

02:03.096 --> 02:07.762
with my husband when he arrived as a freshman at 
Texas A&M. He spent a stint in the service and we

02:08.543 --> 02:14.010
worked in between times from graduation. We 
married in 1952. Why did you all come to A&M? Why

02:19.097 --> 02:20.839
this place?

02:22.642 --> 02:48.261
state school low tuition low rent open admissions 
and there was not there was not any particular

02:22.642 --> 02:48.261
aggie tradition in either family neither family 
and a good engineering petroleum engineering

02:22.642 --> 02:48.261
department and he was going to major in petroleum 
engineering because he knew a lot about the oil

02:22.642 --> 02:48.261
field he'd grown up with the oil field his parents 
were from the oil field did you all come to visit

02:22.642 --> 02:48.261
before you moved Well, we came to visit knowing we 
wanted to move here. We just came to look at it and

02:52.566 --> 02:58.622
see what the employment opportunities were for 
student lives on campus. What did you, in that

02:58.682 --> 03:02.993
first visit, describe what you saw, what you 
found?

03:07.107 --> 03:14.627
Well, I guess we knew that we wanted to come here, 
and we talked about job opportunities. A lot of

03:14.647 --> 03:16.572
student wives worked on campus. That truly was the 
staff on campus, and so there was a lot of turnover

03:16.612 --> 03:23.310
as students graduated or departed. So 
opportunities for the wife to work and the husband

03:23.543 --> 03:32.760
to go to school and for the husband as a student to 
find part-time work was very high. And it appeared

03:33.782 --> 03:39.493
that we had student housing on campus in what was 
called the old student house college view college

03:41.870 --> 04:06.898
view there was a waiting list for college view so 
that we knew that we could not get in the first

03:41.870 --> 04:06.898
semester but we could probably find something off 
campus for the first semester all right now you

03:41.870 --> 04:06.898
came to visit about when to we can't think no to 
check things out we came in the summer before the

03:41.870 --> 04:06.898
fall of 1956. okay and then he enrolled did you have 
any contact any We had some friends down here that

04:07.098 --> 04:09.522
they were in school. He was working on a master's. 
She was a student wife, and we had known her from my

04:11.506 --> 04:15.893
hometown. He was not from my hometown, but we knew 
him. But you all didn't know any faculty member or

04:19.299 --> 04:23.607
staff member, nobody to open the door for you? No. 
All right, then when you all moved, about what time

04:24.547 --> 04:29.976
of the year did you leave Breckenridge? We came in 
either in August or early September of 56. Usually

04:33.962 --> 04:38.429
classes didn't start until after Labor Day, so we 
probably moved here in August of 1956. As much as

04:39.491 --> 04:45.260
you can recall, describe what belongings you 
brought with you. Oh, that was easy. We brought it

04:46.582 --> 04:52.191
in one small trailer pulling behind a 1956 
Chevrolet Impala. You had a new car? We had a new

04:53.964 --> 04:54.665
car. What was in the trailer? Clothes, pots and 
pans, dishes, silverware. No furniture? No

05:03.419 --> 05:04.481
furniture. No furniture. And let's see, you had 
one little one? No. Oh, not yet. She was born in 57.

05:09.288 --> 05:11.291
Oh, okay. And do you remember how much money y'all 
brought with you? Well, we had a little money saved

05:14.530 --> 05:20.179
because my husband had been in service and I had 
been working the two years that he'd been in

05:14.530 --> 05:20.179
service. So we had a little savings when we came. 
And he had the GI Bill. And he had the GI Bill, that's

05:24.105 --> 05:25.688
correct. All right. And do you remember when he 
applied for admission and when you heard a

05:28.472 --> 05:35.964
response?

05:36.605 --> 05:39.289
When we came in the summer, I'm sure he applied and 
We must have heard right away because I even

05:39.674 --> 05:43.500
interviewed for jobs while I was down here. I 
interviewed at the registrar's office, the

05:44.242 --> 05:50.813
placement office, and one other office, which I 
can't remember. Didn't hear from them, but we

05:51.554 --> 05:56.522
rented a post office box while we were here, so we'd 
have a mailing address. The day we moved in with our

05:57.464 --> 06:01.851
trailer pulled behind that Chevrolet Impala. We 
went to the post office, that was on a Friday. I had a

06:04.850 --> 06:09.815
notice from the placement office that I was to 
report for work on Monday morning. And needless to

06:10.816 --> 06:18.123
say, we scrambled for me to find a dress and some 
pantyhose so I could get to work on Monday morning,

06:10.816 --> 06:18.123
but we were elated. You arrived what day, Friday? 
On a Friday, or a Saturday, I can't remember which,

06:19.845 --> 06:23.369
but we went to the post office, we had a key. Where 
did you find a place to live? We're the Nations

06:28.073 --> 06:30.876
Bank's. corner of Texas University. What's the 
name of the bank today? Oh, okay. What's the name of

06:35.852 --> 06:36.993
the bank today? I don't know. It's changed names a 
few times. There were some garage apartments

06:40.277 --> 06:47.386
located on that area of Texas Avenue and 
University where the bank sits today. It was an

06:48.347 --> 06:49.809
upstairs apartment. You parked your garage 
underneath, and the rent was very cheap. Do you

06:54.035 --> 06:55.036
remember what it was? Probably $50 a month, maybe. 
Maybe $50 a month. That's probably about what it

07:01.096 --> 07:02.739
was worth. It had linoleum floors over the 
hardwood. And then the corners, I remember that

07:07.306 --> 07:12.113
the linoleum was nailed down. I couldn't figure 
out why when we moved in in September, but when

07:13.575 --> 07:25.755
winter came, I knew why because the wind whipped up 
and it just raised the linoleum up because the

07:13.575 --> 07:25.755
boards weren't completely together. It was 
furnished, yes. And so you reported for work

07:28.822 --> 07:32.929
where? At the placement office for Mr. Wendell 
Horsley and Mr. Bill Hensel. And do you remember

07:38.938 --> 07:41.402
what the pay was, the starting? I don't know 
exactly, but I'm sure it was not more than $150 a

07:43.706 --> 07:51.018
month, but that seemed like a really good salary to 
us at that time. Right, and then classes began

07:51.819 --> 07:55.605
about when? probably the day after Labor Day at 
that time. And as a freshman, it seemed like Don

07:59.048 --> 08:13.036
came in, went to the, and he was in the basic 
division, is what it was called then, instead of

07:59.048 --> 08:13.036
general studies, and he reported as a freshman a 
few days before the classes start for

07:59.048 --> 08:13.036
orientation, sort of. Right, and what were your 
duties in that first task? I was working with

08:16.308 --> 08:40.860
graduating seniors preparing their credentials 
for interviewing, and so I had to sit down with

08:16.308 --> 08:40.860
them, write their resumes, and put it in a format 
that would present their credentials so that when

08:16.308 --> 08:40.860
the companies came to see what graduates fit with 
their interview schedules, we had them all in

08:16.308 --> 08:40.860
file, make sure their transcripts were in there 
and their letters of reference or reference

08:16.308 --> 08:40.860
forms. I could use either one. Share, if you can, 
share some recollections of some plus and minus

08:47.425 --> 08:51.810
experience with those resume developments. 
There had to be some goofy things that students did

08:51.830 --> 08:55.155
or didn't do. Well, we tried to set up a standard 
format to try to force them to answer certain

08:55.175 --> 08:59.640
questions. And of course, I guess in some ways 
there was always that feeling that they were

09:00.501 --> 09:08.631
padding their resume. But most of them were really 
sincere. They'd bring in documentation that

09:11.955 --> 09:16.521
indicated they were a member of tall beta pi or some 
of the academic societies our engineers council

09:17.311 --> 09:28.300
we knew most of the a lot of the students on campus 
there was only about 7,000, 8,000 students on

09:29.242 --> 09:35.352
campus at that time, so it was not hard to read the 
newspaper and know a lot about the students. In the

09:36.334 --> 09:38.597
fall, you had about 8,000 students. In the spring, 
you usually had about 7,000. And then in the

09:40.580 --> 09:45.048
summer, you only had, if you had 2,000 enrollment, 
that was a high number. So we knew a lot about them.

09:48.113 --> 09:50.136
We could verify their grade point ratio. We could 
verify their grade point ratio in their major

09:50.555 --> 09:55.602
because we could take their transcript and 
actually figure that out. So it was not too hard.

09:57.324 --> 10:01.710
Our goal, the placement office at that time wanted 
a one page resume. So there wasn't a lot of room for

10:01.730 --> 10:05.255
us to put a lot of verbiage in there. Do you remember 
any goofy efforts by any student to kind of fudge a

10:05.715 --> 10:17.271
little and maybe increase their resume more than 
factually it deserved? It's been too long,

10:18.348 --> 10:20.392
Haskell. I can't remember those. And you reported 
to whom? I reported directly to Bill Hensel, and he

10:24.119 --> 10:28.648
reported to Wendell Horsley. And what were the 
normal working hours? 8 to 5 during the week, but

10:33.569 --> 10:47.807
during a lot of the placement time, we had to work on 
Sunday because the office was also responsible

10:33.569 --> 10:47.807
for continuing education activities that came 
in. So a lot of the conferences started on Sunday.

10:50.230 --> 10:56.117
So, excuse me, many times we had to work on Sunday 
for a registration for continuing education

10:50.230 --> 10:56.117
activities. And you all were located where 
physically? What building? We were in a wooden

11:00.522 --> 11:01.804
building.

11:05.497 --> 11:07.922
that has long ago been destroyed, of course. And I 
can't remember where it was located on campus. I

11:12.152 --> 11:14.116
just don't remember where it was located. But it 
was an old wooden building. And this was under the

11:15.479 --> 11:21.312
reported to Mr. Heaton, I presume. I do not know. I 
don't know who the placement office reported to at

11:24.732 --> 11:27.017
that time. Alright, describe this freshman 
getting in the routine of studying and classes and

11:27.057 --> 11:33.328
so forth. Well, he found out very quickly that he 
didn't have enough background to really be a

11:33.348 --> 11:40.701
successful petroleum engineer. So he went to A&M 
Consolidated and bought some of the calculus and

11:40.681 --> 11:52.136
algebra books and studied on his own so that he 
could begin his studies for petroleum

11:40.681 --> 11:52.136
engineering. He studied that at the same time as 
taking his courses. And they took anywhere from

11:55.521 --> 12:00.167
usually about 18 hours per semester. But I've seen 
his transcript in many semesters. Don took as many

12:03.671 --> 12:08.798
as 21 hours a semester and he graduated about fifth 
or sixth in his class in petroleum engineering

12:10.297 --> 12:36.186
when he graduated in four years i was going to say 
and when you all arrived you assumed it was that the

12:10.297 --> 12:36.186
undergraduate years were going to be four years 
but at the same time since don had some oil field

12:10.297 --> 12:36.186
experience he didn't have to do a summer 
internship so and my job required that i worked 12

12:10.297 --> 12:36.186
months out of the year so he took the college 
catalog and figured that he could get a business

12:36.470 --> 13:00.334
degree at the same time he was getting his 
petroleum engineering degree by going summers

12:36.470 --> 13:00.334
and the long terms and so when he graduated in four 
years he actually graduated with two degrees one

12:36.470 --> 13:00.334
in business administration and one in petroleum 
engineering and still graduated with very good

12:36.470 --> 13:00.334
grades all right and as you all are getting started 
where did you first begin to make some friends and

12:36.470 --> 13:00.334
who were they Well, you made friends with the 
people that he was in class with because he began to

13:00.635 --> 13:05.703
know a lot of them. Robert Lacey became a very, very 
close friend of my husband's and probably was his

13:06.524 --> 13:13.535
best friend until the day my husband died. What was 
Lacey doing there? He was a student. He and Don were

13:18.528 --> 13:19.850
both students. They started together and 
graduated together. And Mr. Lacy started out in

13:22.333 --> 13:28.922
petroleum engineering, but his second year, he 
changed to math and graduated in math. But for the

13:29.363 --> 13:32.086
first two years, they took a lot of courses 
together. Even in the summer, they took calculus

13:32.607 --> 13:39.656
and trig and calculus and geometry and some of 
those courses together.

13:42.480 --> 13:43.281
Other friends. I became friends with people I 
worked with at the placement office because their

13:43.531 --> 13:49.520
husbands were also in school. One was Daisy 
Smithwick and her husband was Dick Smithwick, who

13:50.201 --> 14:00.797
was playing football here at that time under Bear 
Bryant, and he had been one of those that went to

13:50.201 --> 14:00.797
West Texas at Junction. Junction. And was headed 
for vet school. And his senior year, he realized

14:06.749 --> 14:11.420
that he couldn't play football and be a 
veterinarian. He couldn't keep up his grades, so

14:11.460 --> 14:15.791
he chose to be a veterinarian and dropped out his 
senior year. We became fast friends, and we're

14:15.871 --> 14:20.001
still friends today, and that's a 44. That's a 
44-year friendship, I guess. That's right. So

14:24.587 --> 14:26.830
it's mine with Mr. Lacy at the same time. And then we 
became friends with a lot of the students and their

14:27.390 --> 14:31.375
wives that Don studied with. There was lots of 
study sessions. Most of them who were in petroleum

14:32.797 --> 14:38.324
engineering spent a lot of time in the Petty Lab. So 
we were left by, the wives were left by ourselves a

14:38.985 --> 14:43.390
lot, and we became fast friends.

14:46.194 --> 14:48.857
In that first fall, What was it like to go to Aggie 
football games for you as a new arrival? Well, it

14:58.606 --> 14:59.467
was exciting. I can remember one of the worst 
storms we had was we were playing TCU and a storm

14:59.807 --> 15:11.862
came in and the light poles bent completely over 
and we didn't realize how dangerous it was as we sat

14:59.807 --> 15:11.862
there on that stadium and played. That was our 
entertainment. we really didn't have a lot of

15:14.065 --> 15:18.972
money for entertainment, so the football games 
were about our only entertainment. We went to Town

15:19.373 --> 15:30.810
Hall occasionally, which was held in Gine Hall at 
that time, and of course Gine Hall is no longer on

15:19.373 --> 15:30.810
campus either, but that was about the extent of our 
entertainment, maybe a once a month movie.

15:31.772 --> 15:40.765
Alright, with his tough academic load and your 
job, normally you left home what time in the

15:31.772 --> 15:40.765
morning? During long semesters, we would leave 
home about 7.30. My job was at 8 and classes were at

15:47.823 --> 15:49.845
8. However, in the summertime, classes started at 
7 because there were no air-conditioned

15:50.526 --> 15:56.454
buildings. And so the classes started at 7 and I 
would go to work when he came to campus because we

15:57.395 --> 16:03.503
only had one car. And then with his student jobs, we 
delivered the paper in the summer to... the

16:10.090 --> 16:13.796
student apartments, and so we'd get up at four and 
deliver papers. Which paper? The Eagle, I think.

16:17.120 --> 16:17.321
The Eagle? Yes, the Eagle. I'm not sure it was 
called Eagle at that time. I think it had a longer

16:20.365 --> 16:24.111
name, but we'd deliver the Eagle or the Houston 
Post. Maybe it was the Houston Post. I guess it was

16:25.453 --> 16:27.376
the Houston Post. And then we'd go home and shower. 
Do you remember what y'all made for the paper job?

16:32.083 --> 16:35.588
Oh, probably if we made $100 a month, we felt good 
about it. We needed the $100, so we did that. All

16:38.356 --> 16:40.073
right, now, did he have the GI Bill? He did have the 
GI Bill. Student paper. Student paper. Your

16:44.959 --> 16:46.120
full-time job. And then he served as apartment 
manager for a few of the complexes over in the

16:46.621 --> 16:51.606
student housing. Okay. But you lived that whole 
first year in the garage apartment? No, we lived

16:55.690 --> 17:00.455
only, we got to move during the spring semester to 
College View. Oh. I don't remember, we didn't get

17:01.877 --> 17:05.100
to move the very first part of the year. Sometime 
during the term, somebody moved out and we were on

17:05.140 --> 17:08.263
the list. So our number was up and we moved there and 
we moved sometime in the late spring of 57.

17:15.881 --> 17:20.566
Describe as much as you can a College View 
apartment. Well one thing about it if you serve

17:20.586 --> 17:41.286
soup you had to make sure that you didn't fill the 
bowl full because it wasn't level and so the soup

17:20.586 --> 17:41.286
would spill out so you the floors weren't very 
level they were two bedroom un-air-conditioned

17:20.586 --> 17:41.286
bunk beds in one room not even a full bed in the other 
room but I'd call a three-quarter bed a bus couch, a

17:42.093 --> 17:56.395
rocking chair, a little wooden table, very, very 
tiny kitchen, very small shower bath, no tub, and

17:42.093 --> 17:56.395
the closets had no doors on them. They were just 
stalls for closets. Washing machine? No, no

18:00.260 --> 18:02.143
washing machine, no dryer. But there was a 
refrigerator. There was a refrigerator, and

18:04.086 --> 18:08.573
there was a plug for a washing machine. So that was 
our big purchase during the spring of 57 was to

18:09.025 --> 18:15.191
purchase a washing machine. What about a dryer? We 
never owned a dryer while we lived there. So you

18:19.135 --> 18:21.457
used a solar dryer? Used a solar dryer, hung them on 
the clotheslines. And matter of fact, one of the

18:24.540 --> 18:37.513
incidents that my husband had to resolve was a 
fight between two women using the clothesline

18:24.540 --> 18:37.513
because you were assigned a certain line to hang 
your laundry on because there were eight

18:24.540 --> 18:37.513
apartments in each building and so you took your 
line and no more when your clothes dried you could

18:38.017 --> 19:05.644
hang additional clothes so it was it was an 
interesting concept lots of interesting

18:38.017 --> 19:05.644
conversations took place at the clothesline uh 
about what what were what were student wives

18:38.017 --> 19:05.644
concerned about in those days

18:38.017 --> 19:05.644
survival and child care A lot of the married people 
did have children. We had our first child November

19:09.851 --> 19:14.595
of 57 when Don was a sophomore here. And there were 
no daycare centers. There was no university

19:19.339 --> 19:23.023
daycare center and very few commercial ones in 
town. So you had to find an individual who was

19:23.663 --> 19:27.266
willing to keep your child. There were one or two of 
the women in the barracks who would take care of

19:28.388 --> 19:34.433
other children, but those were few and far 
between. All right, as this child is on the way, you

19:34.598 --> 19:40.364
worked until about... I worked on Thursday. She 
was born on Saturday. Okay. There was no maternity

19:44.168 --> 19:45.989
leave. Maternity leave did not exist at Texas A&M 
at that time. And your doctor, do you remember who

19:49.773 --> 19:55.599
the... Dr. Gephardt was my doctor. At old St. 
Joseph's? At old St. Joseph's Hospital, that's

19:57.942 --> 20:00.484
correct. And then I was off work for five weeks. And 
then I started working and you had to terminate

20:03.978 --> 20:10.373
because your job was not held for you since there 
was no maternity leave. And then when she was five

20:11.275 --> 20:19.455
weeks old, I started working in the dean's office 
in the College of Engineering working on their

20:11.275 --> 20:19.455
ECPD accreditation. They had someone working on 
it in the daytime, so I would take her car bed up at

20:20.077 --> 20:28.990
night and work on the reports, and my husband would 
study while I worked. And then on weekends I would

20:29.011 --> 20:37.103
work, either Don Keper or Mr. Charlie Crawford's 
wife actually took care of my little baby. He was

20:37.303 --> 20:40.127
the associate dean of engineering. And how many 
hours a week were you working at that point? Oh,

20:44.917 --> 20:55.973
probably 20, 30 hours a week, and then I hadn't been 
there about six or seven weeks, and they offered me

20:44.917 --> 20:55.973
a full-time job, and so I went to work full-time for 
them.

20:57.353 --> 20:59.336
about January of 1958. You don't remember what the 
pay was, any of those? Well, probably $200 a month

21:04.465 --> 21:08.692
at a max. And then I worked there until my husband 
graduated in May of 1960. And in the 60s, I was

21:14.682 --> 21:18.889
pregnant again. And the maternity leave policy at 
Texas A&M at that time was you had to terminate at

21:18.869 --> 21:26.163
six months. That was a requirement. You had to 
bring a note or letter from your doctor that said

21:28.087 --> 21:34.920
you were six months pregnant and you had to 
terminate. So my husband graduated on about the

21:34.900 --> 21:51.780
15th of May and I think I was six months pregnant the 
15th of May and so I managed to work till he

21:34.900 --> 21:51.780
graduated and a paycheck came in in June from Arco, 
the company he chose to go to work for. Alright,

21:53.162 --> 21:59.149
let's go back to those

21:53.162 --> 21:59.149
student years. What courses do you remember for 
him were important because of who was teaching it

22:03.284 --> 22:09.171
or what he learned? What were the, what seemed to be 
the meaningful? Well, of course, his main

22:15.459 --> 22:21.005
interests were the petroleum engineering 
courses, and they were the hardest. Who were some

22:21.206 --> 22:22.988
of the special teachers? Dr. Bass. Bass? Dr. Bass.

22:30.605 --> 22:34.510
Dr. Russell over in geology, you took a lot of 
geology courses.

22:39.897 --> 22:45.083
Calhoun was not... Calhoun, he was not one of Don's 
teachers. If he was here, he was not teaching. He

22:46.625 --> 22:48.107
didn't take any courses under him. Who did your 
husband go to for advice and counsel? There wasn't

22:54.955 --> 22:58.300
a lot of advice and counsel. After you got to be a 
junior or senior, usually your major professors,

22:58.341 --> 23:14.106
you could go to them and ask for advice, but most of 
the time you were pretty much on your own and maybe

22:58.341 --> 23:14.106
one or two in business because he went over to work 
out a degree plan for business while he was here

22:58.341 --> 23:14.106
doing that. But Charlie Randall wasn't yet 
associate dean. No, Charlie Ransdell was still in

23:17.264 --> 23:22.770
the basic division, and no, he was not an 
associate. Who headed petroleum then, do you

23:23.031 --> 23:25.153
remember? Who the senior person was, the key 
person? Who's the building named for? I want to say

23:33.322 --> 23:36.906
Hal Booty. I can't remember who was head of the 
department. I just don't remember that at this

23:40.470 --> 23:42.032
time. When you went to work in engineering, let's 
shift to that, uh where was the dean's office it was

23:46.103 --> 24:15.722
in francis hall uh second floor francis hall and 
the dean was well when i went to work fred benson was

23:46.103 --> 24:15.722
the dean and mr harrington we had just

23:46.103 --> 24:15.722
well we did a lot of work for mr harrington had he 
just left the dean ship or had he left the vice

23:46.103 --> 24:15.722
president's position i think vice president vice 
president position but we did a lot of work for mr

23:46.103 --> 24:15.722
harrington i'm not sure why but we did describe 
Fred Benson as the dean? Oh, Fred Benson was always

24:19.836 --> 24:24.500
a gentleman, always a gentleman. Very stoic, very 
quiet man, but very effective. During the time

24:31.006 --> 24:33.568
that I worked for him, a handsome man. He could have 
doubled for Clark Gable, and as a matter of fact, I

24:33.628 --> 24:45.439
remarked about that once, and someone said, well, 
they weren't sure they saw that resemblance, and

24:33.628 --> 24:45.439
one day I got an article that was sent in the mail to 
him and at the top of it it had written across

24:46.077 --> 25:11.916
Gabriel Benson but he yes he was a wonderful dean 
and only concerned about the students and the

24:46.077 --> 25:11.916
academic life at Texas A&M served on the 
facilities committee he was a civil engineer and

24:46.077 --> 25:11.916
he was also head of TTI at that time and so that was a 
joint venture and his remark I remember him saying

24:46.077 --> 25:11.916
I will never sign another building be built on this 
campus that's not air conditioned and air

25:12.166 --> 25:19.933
conditioning did start with a few buildings in the 
early 60s. You said that he was a you talked about

25:21.375 --> 25:32.205
his qualities give some examples of his 
thoughtfulness to the staff. When my daughter was

25:34.047 --> 25:39.152
about six months old I had to have major surgery on 
an emergency basis and Since my parents were

25:39.790 --> 25:49.569
deceased and Don's parents lived in New York, I 
didn't really have anybody to take care of the

25:39.790 --> 25:49.569
child while I was in the hospital and my husband was 
in school. And unbeknownst to me, Fred Vinson went

25:49.609 --> 25:56.421
home and asked his wife, Marge, and his youngest 
child's name was Clark. He said, Marge, do you

25:56.802 --> 25:58.305
think we could take Clark's baby bed out of the 
attic and take care of that baby for Jeanette. I

26:03.423 --> 26:06.387
found that out much later and didn't know it at the 
time. Of course I made arrangements for someone to

26:06.407 --> 26:11.775
keep my daughter, but I didn't know he'd even 
consider such. And of course Margie's answer was

26:11.815 --> 26:15.942
yes, they would take care of that baby. Now I've 
also heard that he had certain guidelines as to

26:16.603 --> 26:27.499
what things were to be done and not to be done. give 
some examples of the guidelines in the office,

26:28.070 --> 26:34.399
things he did not put up with. He didn't put up with, 
I guess I shouldn't say he didn't put up with, but he

26:34.419 --> 26:51.664
certainly objected to anyone who

26:34.419 --> 26:51.664
wasn't true to their marriage and stepped outside 
those lines if a department head were a

26:55.171 --> 27:04.262
not being as faithful to his wife as he thought he 
should, or there were rumors floating, he'd call

26:55.171 --> 27:04.262
that person in, and if he thought that any student 
had been mistreated, he'd call the department

26:55.171 --> 27:04.262
head in. He was always very, he was very supportive 
of his department heads, but at the same time, he

27:04.323 --> 27:12.893
was also very concerned about his students. And 
how did he treat the staff, the office staff?

27:19.442 --> 27:20.703
With great respect. I never saw him chew anyone in 
the office out, ever. What did you realize early on

27:24.922 --> 27:33.333
were the, for you as a member of the staff, were the 
guidelines though? I worked with J.G. McGuire a

27:35.836 --> 27:41.304
lot who worked on the co-op program and worked with 
all the students who were on probation. So we saw a

27:41.804 --> 27:53.680
lot of problem students and Mr. Benson expected us 
to handle our job unless the situation got very hot

27:41.804 --> 27:53.680
so to speak and If I did my job and did a good job, I was 
rewarded for it. I was always there for a merit

27:58.049 --> 28:02.097
increase if there were any merit increases to be 
done. And also he trusted those unless he had a

28:02.778 --> 28:07.166
reason not to. So I never, if you didn't break that 
trust, it was there. What did a young woman, her

28:11.935 --> 28:16.123
physical appearance, how did a young woman 
prepare herself in what she wore and her hair and

28:16.913 --> 28:23.159
her makeup and so forth in those days? Well, we wore 
dresses. There were no pants on campus at that

28:25.001 --> 28:27.944
time. We all wore dresses. They were certainly 
below the knees. We wore hose, even though the

28:31.828 --> 28:35.331
building was not air-conditioned. We were 
expected to wear hose. And I can remember how

28:37.493 --> 28:44.440
miserable it was to be in hose and a dress and no air 
conditioning. There were a few fans on the floor to

28:44.909 --> 28:49.474
try to keep us cool, but that was not very 
effective. And we didn't have a lot of clothes, but

28:50.675 --> 28:55.820
you didn't have to have a variety. We didn't wear 
suits, just dresses. Did people drink coffee at

28:59.224 --> 29:01.826
their desk in those days? Yes, but you also got a 
coffee break. You got about a 15-minute break, and

29:05.190 --> 29:09.934
if you had a large staff, they would divide it up. 
Some go in the coffee room at one time, sometimes

29:10.215 --> 29:12.537
others. always somebody on the telephones in the 
front door, so to speak. And usually Mr. Benson

29:16.384 --> 29:21.151
would join us in the coffee room and be very relaxed 
and visit with the staff. That's how I got to know

29:21.211 --> 29:23.215
them. What about smoking? There was no smoking in 
the office. It might have been allowed, but no one

29:27.221 --> 29:30.967
smoked. So we never thought about smoking. None of 
the women in the office smoked, as far as you knew?

29:37.417 --> 29:37.498
No. Did some of the men, some of the deans, did they 
No,

29:41.930 --> 29:46.696
not in the 50s. I don't remember any of them who 
smoked. Mr. Crawford didn't, of course, and Mr.

29:48.438 --> 29:54.565
Benson didn't, and Mr. McGuire, and Dr. Winerdi 
didn't. So, no, I don't remember any of them

29:54.665 --> 29:58.210
smoking in the office. Right. Describe the staff. 
When you began, describe the professional staff,

29:59.711 --> 30:07.080
Benson and who were the other professionals in the 
office. Dr. Charles Crawford, who had been... at

30:12.052 --> 30:16.517
one time, I believe, head of the mechanical 
engineering department, was the associate dean.

30:17.439 --> 30:20.602
Dr. Richard Winerdi was hired while I was actually 
there. He was the youngest full professor on this

30:21.143 --> 30:27.971
campus that was hired from 58 to 60. His major was 
also petroleum engineering.

30:33.899 --> 30:36.642
With Crawford, what was his duty? He was in charge 
of reporting, accreditation, the professional

30:37.921 --> 30:45.170
side of the house. Mr. Benson always chaired his 
department head's council. Mr. Crawford sat in,

30:51.217 --> 30:55.563
but Mr. Benson was always there to handle that. So 
policy issues usually came from the dean. Mr.

30:58.547 --> 31:06.156
Crawford might make some recommendations to him, 
but usually the policy issues were decided by Mr.

30:58.547 --> 31:06.156
Benson and the department heads. All right. This 
young man, Winerdi, make believe I didn't know

31:07.628 --> 31:10.514
him. Describe him in that era. He was a very dynamic 
figure, extremely intelligent. I'm sure genius

31:19.252 --> 31:22.238
intelligence came on.
