00:05.920 --> 00:19.119
We're in the beautiful home this afternoon of Dr. 
Dan Anderson of Fulton City, that's Fort Worth,

00:05.920 --> 00:19.119
Texas, an illustrious veterinarian who can look 
back on a very long and productive career. I think

00:20.001 --> 00:27.291
we ought to start with his background, tell where 
he was born and brought up, and I think we ought to

00:20.001 --> 00:27.291
start a little bit with his parents. Dan, tell us 
about your mother and father, when they were born

00:27.732 --> 00:31.658
and what their names were. Well, my mother's name 
was McCoskey, Lucille McCoskey, and that

00:35.941 --> 00:43.192
couldn't be anything but Irish, you know. My 
father was William L. Anderson,

00:43.332 --> 01:02.480
and his

00:43.332 --> 01:02.480
parents

00:43.332 --> 01:02.480
were natives of Rockwell. My great-grandfather 
father on that side. You say your daddy's parents

01:05.503 --> 01:07.966
were natives of Rockwell, Texas? Yes. Boy, that 
goes back a long ways. Over 100 years. And my

01:12.250 --> 01:18.936
great-grandfather migrated to this country. We 
have those old letters to show. But before the

01:22.739 --> 01:25.562
Civil War, of course. And

01:26.663 --> 01:31.868
came out of southern Indiana. Uniontown,

01:32.843 --> 01:38.770
Indiana, and I thought I'd go back up there and look 
around. Just one of those things I haven't done.

01:40.633 --> 01:42.074
That's close to Lincoln country. Yes, yes. Sure 
is. Yeah. Not too far. But anyway, my

01:48.322 --> 01:56.912
background is from a stock farm. My mother and 
father...

02:00.721 --> 02:06.588
reared four children,

02:00.721 --> 02:06.588
two girls and two boys. And you were brought up in 
Rockwall? East of Rockwall, on the stock farm. And

02:13.377 --> 02:28.416
my parents weren't,

02:13.377 --> 02:28.416
they always had to work to educate the kids, but I 
think they did a tremendous job because all four of

02:28.801 --> 02:34.946
us got an education.

02:37.789 --> 02:39.470
What type of schoolhouse did you go to? You started 
out in first grade? Rockwell? I lived so far out in

02:43.854 --> 02:51.061
the country that we couldn't commute in that black 
land over there. The first two years I was in

02:52.642 --> 02:58.487
school, I stayed with my grandparents, my 
Anderson grandparents in Rockwall, and went to

02:58.737 --> 03:06.027
school. And then in the third grade, I went to Royce 
City, which was five miles from my home. By that

03:16.962 --> 03:27.917
time, old Paul Ferguson had built some little 
concrete highways that we could get to town on out

03:16.962 --> 03:27.917
of that black land, so the kids the three of us the 
older ones started to royce city you were a

03:28.184 --> 03:55.170
ferguson fan were you oh uh everybody voted for jim 
ferguson out there in that agricultural country

03:28.184 --> 03:55.170
and anybody that didn't vote for him well they ran 
them off they wouldn't they wouldn't lease land to

03:28.184 --> 03:55.170
them the next year but anyway uh uh

03:28.184 --> 03:55.170
we spent uh two years we went to Royce City then we 
transferred back to Rockwell which was kind of

03:57.142 --> 04:17.402
home base for us always and most of the family both 
sides of the family lived there and I graduated

03:57.142 --> 04:17.402
from from Rockwell High School in 1934. You didn't 
have the honor of going to a one-room grade school

04:18.763 --> 04:23.187
did you? No. That was too bad. I was I was fortunate 
or unfortunate enough to have to go to a larger

04:27.095 --> 04:35.523
school.

04:37.205 --> 04:56.865
Then I

04:37.205 --> 04:56.865
had dreams of athletics and had an opportunity to 
go to Texas Tech

04:37.205 --> 04:56.865
when the old coach that was out there came by and 
talked to Charles Atkins and I. And I went out and

05:01.586 --> 05:03.548
looked around. And then between the time I talked 
with him and

05:03.629 --> 05:16.383
September, it was back during the Depression 
there. And we had an assistant county agent come

05:16.443 --> 05:28.557
into Rockwell County

05:16.443 --> 05:28.557
that somehow convinced me that I ought to go to A&M. 
You're talking about 1933? No, about 1934, the

05:30.743 --> 05:36.791
summer of 34. And

05:38.653 --> 05:53.953
I went to A&M and the first year I studied animal

05:38.653 --> 05:53.953
science or animal husbandry back there then and 
minored in business. And at the end of my freshman

05:55.823 --> 06:03.632
year, I decided that veterinary medicine was the 
best animal husbandry course I could take. So I

06:04.894 --> 06:25.459
transferred over to the School of Veterinary 
Medicine and went to summer school after my

06:04.894 --> 06:25.459
freshman year and got government, freshman 
physiology, and organic chemistry behind me.

06:26.840 --> 06:35.007
I gathered up

06:26.840 --> 06:35.007
the courses as best I could and graduated with my 
class. I guess you'd say I'm just a three-year

06:35.447 --> 06:41.713
student, because I went to that summer school. But 
then I didn't know until the last term of my senior

06:42.133 --> 06:49.079
year whether I was going to graduate. I didn't know 
whether I'd get my courses in or not. But back there

06:51.541 --> 06:55.665
then, I took freshman anatomy and sophomore 
anatomy together. Of course, I went to school day

06:58.547 --> 07:01.990
and night, you know, around the clock. That was 
1936, your freshman anatomy. Mark Francis was

07:05.734 --> 07:07.876
still around then, wasn't he? Oh, yes. Let me see. 
In 1935 and 1936, I

07:09.858 --> 07:18.768
studied anatomy under Dr. Francis.

07:22.371 --> 07:25.855
He had an assistant that taught us that taught 
also, but Dr. Francis was head of the department,

07:26.830 --> 07:37.565
of course. And then there was Marsteller, Dr. 
Marsteller. These two gentlemen had rather

07:42.732 --> 07:46.297
different personalities, didn't they? What was 
Dr. Francis like? Oh, Dr. Francis was just a staid

07:48.079 --> 07:53.547
gentleman.

07:55.585 --> 07:58.389
as far as the students were concerned.

08:00.972 --> 08:03.996
He couldn't hear. If you wanted to talk to him, you 
had to write something down. He said, that didn't

08:08.421 --> 08:10.544
make any difference. Most of what you hear is not 
worth a darn anyway. He didn't let that deter him

08:14.189 --> 08:18.314
because he had no hearing. But he

08:18.334 --> 08:24.782
was very capable and And he always had some little 
way of tying that anatomical structure or that

08:25.454 --> 08:41.478
artery and nerve or that bone. He'd tie it to 
something that you'd see in the clinic some of

08:41.818 --> 08:45.224
these days. I remember he was

08:46.005 --> 08:54.938
no doubt talking about the stifle. And he showed us 
how a string-halted horse would walk, see? And he

09:01.133 --> 09:05.297
says, you'll find it right there. You'll know all 
about that, though, when you get to talking to

09:05.437 --> 09:10.222
Marsteller down there in the clinic. And he just 
had a way of impressing you with those important

09:10.342 --> 09:25.498
structures, that part of the anatomy which he felt 
that you'd be using the most. or it'd kind of be

09:25.917 --> 09:31.766
everyday use for you when you got out and got into 
practice. Mark Steller was a

09:31.786 --> 09:42.361
very peculiar individual.

09:45.426 --> 09:48.551
I always got along well with him. But some of the 
students, if they If they did something that Mark

09:51.787 --> 10:03.020
Stoller didn't like, well, he had a way of making 
things rough on them. But I always got along fine

10:03.040 --> 10:06.224
with the old man. Never had a bit of trouble with 
him. In fact, I, of course, used a little politics.

10:17.757 --> 10:21.321
I didn't realize I was doing it at the time. When I 
transferred from

10:22.617 --> 10:35.553
animal husbandry over to the School of Veterinary 
Medicine, I had some electives that I could take. I

10:36.935 --> 10:46.347
had a year of college math, and I had a year of 
agronomy, and I had some agroeconomics.

10:48.925 --> 10:50.407
I could use as electives. There were a certain 
number of elective subjects in the last two years

10:50.427 --> 10:56.637
of veterinary medicine. And I needed those 
electives. And I went down to see him one day, first

10:58.700 --> 11:03.847
of my sophomore year. And, well, he said, Mr. 
Anderson, you don't need any mathematics in

11:05.710 --> 11:12.721
veterinary medicine. That agricultural 
economics, you can just throw that out the window

11:13.442 --> 11:17.548
and says, Lord, that agronomy. I don't see where we 
can take any of that as electives. I said, well, all

11:24.790 --> 11:27.755
right, sir. So I thought, well, if I don't get 
something done, I'm going to be in this

11:27.775 --> 11:33.084
institution an extra year. But the following 
fall, my junior year, we were in clinic in that old

11:34.727 --> 11:43.502
amphitheater down there. Marsteller walked in 
that Saturday morning. He says, now, gentlemen,

11:47.443 --> 11:51.608
we're having a football game over here today. 
Baylor University is coming over here, and we're

11:52.529 --> 12:02.901
having all of the legislatures coming over here 
from Austin. They got on a special train and came

12:02.921 --> 12:06.165
over, all the legislatures.

12:08.491 --> 12:17.522
Well, I got to think, and it says, if you know a 
representative or if you know a state senator, be

12:08.491 --> 12:17.522
nice to him because that's where our money comes 
from. Well,

12:18.943 --> 12:25.050
I got to thinking about it. I had politicked for my 
state senator. I'd stumped for him. And I wanted

12:30.497 --> 12:32.819
him to meet Marsteller. I said, you know, I don't 
know what I was thinking back then, but anyway.

12:38.697 --> 12:46.264
Soon as that football game was over, I had Claude 
Isabel spotted, and I found Marsteller, and I got

12:38.697 --> 12:46.264
them together. I said, this is Senator Isabel. Oh, 
yeah, Doctor. And Isabel was an influential man in

12:53.231 --> 12:56.574
Austin at that time. So Marsteller put us in that 
old Studebaker sedan of his, took us down to the

12:56.594 --> 13:08.265
hospital, and opened the door, and says, show him 
around, Dan. And I showed him around, you know, and

13:08.498 --> 13:14.464
I forget now what all we went into. But anyway, then 
we took the senator back and put him on the train.

13:21.933 --> 13:27.058
The old man gave me one of those Maxauer cigars and 
took me around to the dormitory. And he was just

13:28.199 --> 13:33.425
pleased as punch, you know. And, of course, I was 
happy that we got them together. But anyway... I

13:38.873 --> 13:47.742
went on to the house, but on Monday afternoon, as 
soon as I got a chance, I went down to see

13:38.873 --> 13:47.742
Marsteller. Come in, Dan. What can I do for you? 
Well, I've got some courses here I want to transfer

13:49.564 --> 13:54.008
as electives. I've got some college math here. Oh, 
yeah, everybody, that's basic. Everybody ought

13:59.794 --> 14:01.456
to have mathematics. Everybody ought to have some 
mathematics, that algebra especially. And that

14:07.257 --> 14:34.969
agricultural economics says that that just gives 
you a more well-rounded education and that

14:07.257 --> 14:34.969
agronomy you know that's that that's the earth 
that you everybody ought to have that too and i said

14:07.257 --> 14:34.969
well now that's what what else i said that's all 
that's all that's all i have yeah well couldn't we

14:07.257 --> 14:34.969
couldn't we use that in place of something else no 
sure i said that's all well that was that was 12

14:07.257 --> 14:34.969
hours Let me see. I think Bull Tech's advanced 
military science was a three-hour course. So that

14:43.896 --> 14:49.262
was six hours in junior year and six hours in the 
senior year, as well as I remember. So it was 12

14:49.282 --> 14:53.967
hours of work, and he just flipped it over to me just 
like that. Well, anyway,

14:55.148 --> 15:04.618
Mark Steller had his faults, but again, I remember 
when I had finished school, and I hadn't been out of

15:05.172 --> 15:15.725
school very long, and... You graduated in... 
1938, yes. Go ahead.

15:20.150 --> 15:21.572
I needed a recommendation. I was going to work for 
the Ralston Purina Company, and they wanted a

15:21.712 --> 15:32.665
letter of recommendation from the school and my 
credits and all that stuff. And he wrote me the

15:33.607 --> 15:36.530
darndest recommendation ever. Well, he did that 
for all of the boys. After they got out, if he could

15:39.754 --> 15:42.838
do anything for them. Now, he was hard on Dick. He 
was hard on Dick. And he was hard on several of the

15:47.604 --> 15:53.691
older of the students above me. Dick who? Dick 
Self? Oh, Dick. Dickinson. Dickinson. Ray

15:57.996 --> 15:58.957
Dickinson. Oh, yeah. OK. All right. All right. But 
I got along fine with Marsteller and Dr. Leonard.

16:10.400 --> 16:24.218
We were fortunate back there then to have the 
professors down there that we had.

16:24.923 --> 16:43.179
I give them a lot of credit for... Up until that 
time, the School of Veterinary Medicine, as far as

16:24.923 --> 16:43.179
legislative acts for funds, it was very difficult 
for the veterinary division to get very much

16:24.923 --> 16:43.179
funding. Isn't that right? Oh, that's right. And 
your class was small. Isn't that correct, too? The

16:48.504 --> 16:54.829
class before me, I think, had eight or ten 
students. But my class comes along, and we had

16:55.450 --> 17:01.217
about 32, I think, or 35, or something like that. 
But the financing was a per capita thing, based on

17:01.877 --> 17:11.749
the number of students that you had. And that's why 
after 38, or after my class graduated, we had a lot

17:11.769 --> 17:25.204
of those boys from New York, and New Jersey, and all 
over the world that came in here and they were

17:25.589 --> 17:27.971
accepted.

17:30.574 --> 17:37.701
But it was a necessity to keep the school going. 
When you graduated, did you work for Ralston

17:38.822 --> 17:41.385
Purina to start? Well, no. I spent my junior, the 
summer of my junior year, in San Antonio with Drs.

17:52.356 --> 17:53.537
Gleeson and Neal. And that was the best three 
months of training that I had prior to graduation.

18:03.525 --> 18:04.927
It was a mixed practice? In a mixed practice. And 
after

18:06.909 --> 18:22.931
spending one summer down there with them, I went 
back to A&M, and if there was a surgery to do, I'd

18:06.909 --> 18:22.931
grab it and do it. You know, those other boys 
were... they were a little hesitant because they

18:24.854 --> 18:51.992
hadn't had that hands-on training like i had then i 
went back with them for uh two or three months after

18:24.854 --> 18:51.992
i graduated and this opportunity with ralston 
purina came up and i went with them for a couple of

18:24.854 --> 18:51.992
years that brought you up to 1940 and the war was 
beginning uh well i i moved back to uh back to taro

18:24.854 --> 18:51.992
texas which is only about 15 miles from my old home 
and uh went into practice there i was there for uh

18:52.158 --> 19:20.089
well i was with uh i was with Purina only a year i 
guess and then i came back there and i was in

18:52.158 --> 19:20.089
practice two years until august of 1941 and i was 
called into active beauty old General McCallum,

19:21.487 --> 19:37.131
it was Colonel McCallum then, was service command 
veterinarian, 8th service command

19:21.487 --> 19:37.131
veterinarian. And he was stationed in San 
Antonio. I reported into Fort Sam Houston August

19:39.956 --> 19:45.244
the 13th, 1941.

19:47.828 --> 19:49.350
And I had been there about two

19:50.647 --> 19:54.251
weeks. And they had the maneuvers going on in 
Louisiana. 25,000 men down in Louisiana, the

19:59.217 --> 20:05.264
biggest maneuver they'd had since World War I. And 
they needed a little help up here on meat

20:07.646 --> 20:14.975
procurement in Fort Worth. So McCallum told me, he 
said, uh, We are going to send you to Fort Worth for

20:19.570 --> 20:28.382
about 30 days, and then I'll bring you back here, 
and I'll send you to Chicago to the meat school.

20:28.903 --> 20:32.688
Then I'll give you an airfield out here somewhere 
to handle. I said, that's all right. That's fine.

20:36.674 --> 20:43.203
Well, I'd been up here about 30 days, and I was with 
Colonel Ludwigs. Colonel Ludwigs called me in one

20:43.223 --> 20:46.928
day and says, how would you like to stay here? Well, 
I said, Colonel, that'd make me so darn mad I

20:48.275 --> 20:51.639
wouldn't know what to do. He said, well, we're 
going to keep you. So I

20:54.242 --> 21:00.349
fought the war right here in Dallas and Fort Worth. 
I was head of procurement in Dallas for a year or

21:00.930 --> 21:05.075
two. But

21:07.518 --> 21:16.408
our group weren't moved because

21:19.088 --> 21:33.346
At the outbreak of war, we were shown, our 201 files 
showed that we were at the San Antonio QM Depot.

21:35.249 --> 21:46.463
Then in a year or two, when the Fort Worth 
Quartermaster Depot was formed, we showed to have

21:35.249 --> 21:46.463
transferred from San Antonio to Fort Worth. Well, 
during the war, you know, they tried to transfer

21:47.017 --> 21:52.165
you around. If you'd been to a place so long, you 
know, they'd transfer you to some other place. And

21:57.573 --> 22:05.485
because we, our 201 file showed that we had had a 
transfer, we just fought the war right here in Fort

21:57.573 --> 22:05.485
Worth. However, there was quite a bit to be done. 
The Fort Worth stockyards were in their heyday in

22:08.710 --> 22:11.995
those days. And there was a lot of procurement 
going on, and the Veterinary Corps at that time

22:12.734 --> 22:23.985
really got a pretty good name for itself in the 
inspection and procurement situation. Isn't

22:24.005 --> 22:25.687
that correct? Really and truly, the Veterinary 
Corps did a tremendous job. Tell us about your

22:33.814 --> 22:40.581
operation here in Fort Worth with the 
Quartermaster. We had,

22:41.523 --> 22:52.293
I guess, eight or 10 veterinary officers 
permanently assigned here. And then on into the

22:52.934 --> 23:01.923
war, we had a

22:52.934 --> 23:01.923
schooling.

23:04.966 --> 23:05.887
What did they call it? Well, anyway, we brought 
young veterinary officers in that And they were

23:10.902 --> 23:18.753
assigned to us on temporary duty until they either 
went to Chicago or were transferred out somewhere

23:10.902 --> 23:18.753
else. And we were charged with the responsibility 
of

23:19.554 --> 23:37.618
seeing that these contracts were filled with the 
product as designated in the contract. that the

23:38.071 --> 23:40.834
product met those specifications. And we pretty 
well, as far as the

23:41.995 --> 23:57.729
sanitation and all, we had the help of the USDA 
people. But there were times when we had to blow the

24:00.371 --> 24:07.858
whistle because of sanitary reasons, not 
Necessarily at the packing house, but at some

24:08.733 --> 24:16.881
other places that we had around here that were 
producing food products. But anyway, we had Armor

24:17.381 --> 24:31.075
and Swift, and we had procurement from the Fort 
Worth Poultry and Egg Company and one or two other

24:17.381 --> 24:31.075
poultry places. And then we had dairy products. We 
even bought fish. Fish. And it got to the point

24:39.929 --> 24:48.923
there at one time where we bought carp from 
McQuillan's Fish Market, I think it was. But I

24:49.523 --> 24:58.678
even did inspection. They sent me to Dallas.

25:04.758 --> 25:12.267
I hadn't been in service too long to inspect a 
canning plant. They were producing army field

25:12.287 --> 25:19.997
ration at the old thrift packing company over 
there. And we produced millions and millions of

25:21.038 --> 25:28.528
cans of that field ration. And I didn't know 
anything about pulling the vacuum or... any of the

25:35.082 --> 25:40.850
process of canning, but I learned it. You know, you 
had to learn it. And it was interesting, and then we

25:42.833 --> 26:04.482
pulled out a certain number of cans out of each 
batch and put it over there in an incubator with the

25:42.833 --> 26:04.482
temperature way up, you know, and let it incubate 
for so many days to make sure that the product was

25:42.833 --> 26:04.482
properly processed. And then it was shipped out to 
go all over the world. It was really a big operation

26:09.421 --> 26:14.229
as far as the number of tons of supplies that went 
out. Right, right. Before we get back to your

26:17.153 --> 26:25.185
veterinary practice and so forth, I'd like to have 
you comment just a little bit on the demise of the

26:17.153 --> 26:25.185
Fort Worth Stockyards. That was something that 
had to come, isn't that correct, because of the The

26:29.285 --> 26:37.712
fact that it shipped the animals in when it was 
easier to put the packing house out near the

26:29.285 --> 26:37.712
animals, isn't that more or less the basis of the 
situation? That's true of the packing plants.

26:43.417 --> 26:48.281
Now, Armour and Swift were big operations here at 
that time, as we saw it. Each plant had about 3,000

26:50.383 --> 26:54.706
to 4,000 people working in it. There were 3,000 to 
4,000 people in each plant. And

27:00.014 --> 27:08.602
it had got to the point, though, where a lot of their 
equipment was obsolete. And these more modern

27:09.142 --> 27:14.967
plants could do the job quicker and more 
efficiently. But Armour and Swift or someone

27:15.407 --> 27:29.700
could have come in here and taken over and put in one 
of those streamlined plants. But the

27:30.102 --> 27:51.787
distribution of cattle chains, we saw so many of 
these auction markets spring up, and cattle were

27:30.102 --> 27:51.787
marketed through the auction markets, and then 
they'd be sent to packers. They didn't have to come

27:53.229 --> 27:54.811
through Fort Worth. They'd be sent to packers all 
over the country and even out of state. on the fat

27:59.532 --> 28:00.974
cattle. And of course, the stocker and feeder 
cattle went out to the feedlots and back to the

28:00.994 --> 28:11.044
country. And that cut down tremendously on the 
heads of cattle going through the Fort Worth

28:11.825 --> 28:20.014
stockyards. That's what really hurt the 
stockyards more than anything else, or your

28:20.855 --> 28:27.902
auction markets springing up. And it was 
justified. You know, if

28:32.982 --> 28:43.052
you take your cattle to an auction, you can sit 
there and watch them, and if you don't like the

28:32.982 --> 28:43.052
price, you can peel them. But so many times you've 
shipped cattle into Fort Worth, and you've spent a

28:44.213 --> 28:56.505
lot of money getting them in here, and you'll take a 
bigger loss and just let them go than you would if

28:44.213 --> 28:56.505
you were closer to home with them. And the 
so-called commission people got their

28:57.295 --> 29:00.099
commission no matter what. They did, and some of 
them in an unscrupulous manner, unfortunately.

29:05.767 --> 29:07.490
That didn't help the stockyards either. You know, 
there was wire working in that commission

29:07.510 --> 29:13.599
business. We had honest commission people, but we 
had a lot of the kind that we don't want to do

29:14.500 --> 29:20.348
business with. I want to get off into practice now, 
but I think I want to. Okay, tell us about the

29:25.358 --> 29:30.365
beginning of practice. I know it wasn't quite the 
same getting out of school and so forth as if you

29:30.765 --> 29:41.320
hadn't had the three months down there in San 
Antonio, but when you got out on your own there in

29:30.765 --> 29:41.320
East Texas, how did you feel? What did you do? After 
I talked with you this morning, I

29:44.043 --> 29:52.615
hadn't. really surveyed that thing so much uh in 
the past i just think about the changes that have

29:53.827 --> 30:23.293
been made but as i think back of the things that i 
didn't have the tools that i didn't have to

29:53.827 --> 30:23.293
practice with then that we have today it scares me i 
don't know why anybody would go into practice uh

29:53.827 --> 30:23.293
what we didn't know any better you know back there 
in those days uh i made a A few little notations

30:25.484 --> 30:27.206
here.

30:32.953 --> 30:35.996
You were more or less more out in the boonies than 
you were in Houghton City. Tell us about practice

30:36.057 --> 30:37.739
out there. You're a little closer to the soil out 
there than you are here. Well, practice was rough

30:43.986 --> 30:49.973
back in those days.

30:50.847 --> 31:17.817
you might go out and treat a milk fever for four or 
five dollars and pull a calf for six or eight and

30:50.847 --> 31:17.817
castrate a colt for two dollars because that was 
the going price in that area for the we had a lot of uh

30:50.847 --> 31:17.817
of non-graduates you know a lot of quacks in the 
area in fact i remember about 1940

30:50.847 --> 31:17.817
when uh The investigator for the state 
association,

31:17.932 --> 31:24.479
no, let me see. Yeah, he was with the state 
association. It wasn't the board that he was with.

31:29.645 --> 31:31.026
He was with the state association. And we had an old 
quack down there. Did you remember the name of this

31:34.390 --> 31:36.813
investigator or not? No, I don't remember his 
name. Okay, all right. We had an old gentleman down

31:40.677 --> 31:43.500
there that was a non-graduate. uh and didn't even 
have a non-graduate license he was just right

31:44.425 --> 32:13.960
quack and he had raised a family there in carroll 
and he knew the justice of the peace and he was he was

31:44.425 --> 32:13.960
a good citizen and he was uh everybody knew him you 
know and this investigator came in and he said well

31:44.425 --> 32:13.960
we've got all the facts on this fella and uh we've 
got information that with the old practice act we

32:14.615 --> 32:23.385
had then, we can get an injunction against him 
doing any more work. What do you want to do? And I

32:25.107 --> 32:30.073
thought about it a few minutes, and I said, I don't 
want to do it. I said, if he can out-quack me, he can

32:30.153 --> 32:33.457
have it. Well, he went back and told the old justice 
of the peace what remarks I'd made, Well, that old

32:40.248 --> 32:48.558
man was immediately my friend, and the word spread 
all over the country that that doctor didn't want

32:40.248 --> 32:48.558
to do anything to that old man. The word got around. 
But anyway... Didn't you feel that you actually

32:53.464 --> 33:00.934
did better with his goodwill and the difficult 
work he would just refer to you more or less? Isn't

33:01.755 --> 33:03.517
that the way it worked out? The way it worked out, I 
had the goodwill of everybody, see? And he had a lot

33:10.100 --> 33:11.922
of friends. He'd been down there 50 years, and he 
had a lot, you know, friends. You meet a lot of

33:17.009 --> 33:21.214
people, but old friends, that's different. And 
had I had him stop, it wouldn't have helped me a bit.

33:29.445 --> 33:29.885
Sure wouldn't. Well, actually, they weren't 
around too much longer. In my case, we had one the

33:32.769 --> 33:36.934
same way in the town, and when he Now his 
granddaughters are some of my excellent clients.

33:40.753 --> 33:43.336
Yeah, right, right, right. He borrowed a bottle of 
rabies vaccine from me and never paid me back. How

33:46.701 --> 33:47.882
did you find practice? You were talking about, I 
know you're getting your notes out about what you

33:49.625 --> 33:52.489
did. The first farm calls that you made with the 
drugs and the equipment that you had, how did you

33:53.350 --> 34:01.341
just get the job done? What kind of a card did you 
have to go out with and so forth? Well, I had a...

34:09.483 --> 34:14.632
I had a Ford Coupe, we called it back there then, a 
business cube. And, uh... You have a bag and... Oh,

34:16.395 --> 34:19.740
yes. And a box, too? Yes, I still have the old bag 
that my sister and brother-in-law gave me when I

34:20.482 --> 34:26.031
started in practice. Didn't you get it, uh, 
bronze? No, I... All right, all right, but she

34:28.756 --> 34:32.602
still got it. But anyway, we had calcium 
gluconate, uh... You already had calcium

34:36.230 --> 34:38.952
gluconate by that time. Yes. Things have come a 
long ways. Just within the past few years, they had

34:42.255 --> 34:54.285
found out the use, the value of calcium gluconate 
in milk pavers.

34:56.687 --> 35:05.595
We still had a full of aricoline for...

35:05.997 --> 35:34.890
orichalene and atropine uh or colics you know uh

35:05.997 --> 35:34.890
we used we had we had uh nux vomica strychnine those 
the same thing which we used quite a lot in bovine

35:05.997 --> 35:34.890
practice and we had some of those old barium 
chloride tablets uh I believe it was barium

35:35.174 --> 35:36.536
chloride. We called them rumen stimulants that 
we'd give those old cows. As

35:43.125 --> 35:56.343
I look at what we have today that we didn't have 
then, I don't know how we got along, really. Of

35:56.543 --> 36:04.894
course, your advice on husbandry and care and your 
knowledge of parasitism and so forth was such that

35:56.543 --> 36:04.894
you gave a lot of advice on how to get along without a 
lot of medications. Well, that's very true.

36:09.073 --> 36:09.794
That's very true. We gave a lot of thought even back 
there then to animal health and preventative

36:09.834 --> 36:20.225
medicine. But

36:22.047 --> 36:34.240
when I started into practice, all of the vitamins, 
they weren't standardized.

36:34.844 --> 36:48.385
When I was a student, when I was a student in A&M, I 
worked in the animal science department with

36:34.844 --> 36:48.385
graduate students studying deficiencies of 
vitamins. We'd produce vitamin A deficiency in

36:48.425 --> 37:01.425
chickens, and we'd bear a bear in pigeons, I guess. 
All of these deficiencies we could exhibit, we

37:02.553 --> 37:18.975
could show, and then put them on cod liver oil 
supplements or the vitamin C. Well, the vitamin C

37:02.553 --> 37:18.975
would use orange juice back then, see? And nurse 
these animals back. And it was very interesting,

37:23.080 --> 37:26.805
just as a student, to see how those animals would 
recover if we hadn't let them go too far with

37:28.169 --> 37:33.654
deficiency. And we'd get a vitamin E deficiency in 
rats by feeding polished rice, I think. I don't

37:41.782 --> 37:42.163
know. But anyway, we didn't have any units. No 
standardization in our vitamins. But it was good.

37:55.743 --> 38:02.715
to know that

37:55.743 --> 38:02.715
we needed all of those necessary things. But 
anyway, I think even back there then that our basic

38:03.716 --> 38:22.307
knowledge in pathology and physiology and all, we 
were able to... could help a lot of people with

38:23.198 --> 38:29.827
animal health problems or by disease prevention. 
Very good. At that time, there

38:32.570 --> 38:45.868
was so much demand for veterinary medicine that 
there really wasn't a whole lot of crowding and so

38:32.570 --> 38:45.868
forth, was there?

38:50.093 --> 38:51.535
No, there wasn't, but The economy of the times

38:53.371 --> 39:05.368
forced us to work pretty hard for a little money, 
see? The fees

39:06.850 --> 39:14.822
weren't anything like what they are today. We were 
just coming out of the Depression, or we were still

39:16.023 --> 39:22.753
in a depressed state, and uh... we had to work uh... 
our services uh... well they weren't worth a whole

39:23.847 --> 39:53.837
lot based on the economics of the animal you know 
right about your time was when we started the birth

39:23.847 --> 39:53.837
of what you might call aseptic veterinary 
medicine people like bill armistead he was in your

39:23.847 --> 39:53.837
class was he not there were several famous people 
in your class besides bill dan roberts and Cocky

39:54.745 --> 40:08.446
Hander,

39:54.745 --> 40:08.446
and Darrell Sprott, who was killed in an 
automobile accident several years ago, who did

39:54.745 --> 40:08.446
some good work in the Philippines during the war. 
He was, Sprott was very active in the quarter horse

40:10.849 --> 40:23.048
business, owned a famous quarter horse from the 
King Ranch, and had he lived, I'm sure that he would

40:10.849 --> 40:23.048
have been very active in the quarter horse 
business today.

40:29.270 --> 40:30.171
Well, let's see. And George Thomas from over 
there. A couple of boys from Mississippi,

40:33.194 --> 40:38.280
brothers. One of them was a state veterinarian 
down there

40:38.660 --> 40:44.286
for a while. Yeah, we had some. Oh,

40:46.568 --> 40:51.914
my. I can't think of those boys' names. We had some 
fine people in that class.

41:03.879 --> 41:09.527
Back in those days, we just started out on aseptic 
veterinary medicine. When you first started to

41:09.567 --> 41:16.615
practice, aseptic techniques weren't really so 
popular then as they were a couple years later.

41:16.636 --> 41:17.196
Isn't that right? I think... I think that

41:23.440 --> 41:36.639
they began stressing aseptic techniques more 
after my graduation, yes. Let me put it another

41:36.659 --> 41:38.422
way. They began to really realize the importance 
of it. When I graduated from school a few years

41:41.807 --> 41:48.697
later, they wouldn't have thought of going into 
the abdomen of a horse. And if they did, they gave a

41:49.037 --> 41:52.823
very unfavorable prognosis. But now they do it 
with impunity. You don't need to worry about it.

42:01.544 --> 42:02.665
This is an interesting point. And that came up in 
our lifetime, isn't that correct? That came up in

42:04.848 --> 42:06.250
our lifetime. We were taught that if you invaded 
the abdominal cavity of the horse, peritonitis

42:06.310 --> 42:15.323
was inevitable. Do you know what? After the war, in 
the... I guess about 1947, I did the first

42:23.296 --> 42:30.263
successful cesarean on a mare. Recorded success, 
recorded. And it wasn't anything, I wasn't, it

42:34.108 --> 42:43.658
wasn't because of me, it was, I just happened to be 
at the right place at the right time. I had a

42:44.399 --> 42:52.307
thoroughbred mare brought in to me that was bred to 
a famous imported horse, Knight's Caprice. He was

42:57.287 --> 42:59.610
supposed to be an outstanding horse. He never did. 
But anyway, this old boy said, I want to save that

43:00.672 --> 43:11.385
colt,

43:00.672 --> 43:11.385
even if we have to sacrifice the mother. Well, that 
old mare went into labor on a Sunday afternoon, and

43:11.405 --> 43:18.274
that colt was all turned around. I says, I don't 
think I'll ever deliver that colt alive. I hit her

43:23.759 --> 43:36.537
with mag chloral and knocked her down,

43:23.759 --> 43:36.537
sliced her flank open, removed, took out that live 
coat, and I said, I can't let this mare die. But then

43:36.597 --> 43:46.430
we had some sulfur drugs, and we had a few things,

43:36.597 --> 43:46.430
and I sewed her back up, and she lived. Without 
shaving and all that sort of thing? Oh, I shaved.

43:52.025 --> 43:52.566
I'm sure. I don't remember the details, but yeah, 
yeah. But you did a reasonably septic job, right?

43:57.191 --> 43:58.252
Yes, yes, yes. But the thing of it is, that 
stimulated other people. They said, well, look

44:04.440 --> 44:13.290
there, if that old country boy saved this mayor, 
well, necessarily, and that means that we can do

44:04.440 --> 44:13.290
more research in that area. And this was recorded 
in the old Gen Sal Journal. And I used to have one,

44:17.692 --> 44:22.317
but I've lost it somewhere in the long run. But I 
gave all of the procedures. John Wilkins, do you

44:26.242 --> 44:29.165
remember John Wilkins? Well, no. Go ahead. John 
was with Gensow, and he said, Dan, we ought to write

44:33.410 --> 44:40.298
that up. I said, yeah, all right. So I sat down and 
scribbled a few notes, and he put it together, and

44:42.020 --> 44:45.724
it And it was published in the Gen Sal Journal in 
about 1947, I guess. And let me see.

44:59.645 --> 45:03.448
Yeah, it was 46 or 47. And

45:03.528 --> 45:15.559
as I say, it wasn't because I was an outstanding 
individual in any way. It just happened that way,

45:19.693 --> 45:23.258
see. That's wonderful. That was a wonderful 
beginning, and things went on from there. Same way

45:28.085 --> 45:33.894
with when you moved here to Haltom City, you didn't 
practice too long out in East Texas, did you? No.

45:34.876 --> 45:37.299
You stayed in Fort Worth after you left the 
service. Well, when I, let me see, in 45, when we saw

45:37.339 --> 45:45.732
the war was going to be over, Eddie Grist was state 
veterinarian and his office was over here in the

45:47.197 --> 45:56.260
W.T. Wagner building in Fort Worth. Eddie was 
hired by A&M
