WEBVTT

00:02.866 --> 00:22.454
and

00:02.866 --> 00:22.454
the university and many research organizations 
because it's there and because they can conduct

00:02.866 --> 00:22.454
experiments there. The nominal cost, in the 
meantime, they don't even have to pay it. And

00:23.816 --> 00:25.498
that's where we have a problem right now with the 
sites that are not being paid. But

00:26.137 --> 00:50.551
I think that we should keep it. We should maintain 
it. It's a great thing. There's more research.

00:51.893 --> 00:52.835
And, of course, there's research opportunities. 
Is this changed recently? Some of the last two

00:53.375 --> 00:53.916
years.

00:59.397 --> 01:11.500
I

00:59.397 --> 01:11.500
think

00:59.397 --> 01:11.500
it was dynamic And

01:13.488 --> 01:28.787
it has

01:13.488 --> 01:28.787
served well. And it's still doing fine now. And it 
supports a large number

01:29.428 --> 01:39.260
of medical researchers and other universities 
that serve the industry. But the philosophy of who

01:39.280 --> 01:40.362
pays is a big question. If it stays in fees, it'll 
have to increase its charges. make

01:42.327 --> 01:56.688
people pay for the services

01:42.327 --> 01:56.688
they get. It goes to the university, and that's

01:56.708 --> 02:07.443
the way it is. If the legislature will fund it, then 
it can be a service. It does not require payment for

02:08.645 --> 02:09.526
the service. Have there been any other... Well,

02:11.251 --> 02:36.376
I think the strategic

02:11.251 --> 02:36.376
technology that's going on right now is receiving 
a lot more attention because the international

02:11.251 --> 02:36.376
attention has increased. I think that the 
Department of Defense paying more

02:37.137 --> 03:00.567
attention

02:37.137 --> 03:00.567
to organizations

02:37.137 --> 03:00.567
like the Center, which has become a favorite. And 
so they are investing more in some of the type

03:00.587 --> 03:02.389
studies that are being conducted there. And 
incidentally, that's a very interdisciplinary

03:02.409 --> 03:03.691
group as well. It has history people, chemistry 
people, Your

03:04.492 --> 03:28.017
colleague,

03:04.492 --> 03:28.017
who is an associate director here, is working on 
one of Dr. Thomas's problems involving chemical

03:04.492 --> 03:28.017
production in the eastern part. But I think it's 
the tensions in Greece and the security of the

03:28.037 --> 03:30.039
nation that comes with more concern. There will be 
more students in that area. And this is a new area.

03:36.267 --> 03:46.699
I

03:36.267 --> 03:46.699
think that with the new emphasis on space, the 
space program is the

03:51.387 --> 04:03.620
attention.

04:03.640 --> 04:18.036
I think that we will have

04:03.640 --> 04:18.036
to hire some interesting people, faculty, 
faculty researchers, to look at some of the

04:03.640 --> 04:18.036
problems that a space station will have, problems 
with power in space, anything, communicate with

04:03.640 --> 04:18.036
it, grow things, clone this and clone that. Has

04:19.484 --> 04:39.619
the goal changed since you came?

04:43.126 --> 05:04.052
Let me just

04:43.126 --> 05:04.052
try to

04:43.126 --> 05:04.052
quote for you

04:43.126 --> 05:04.052
a statement from the

04:43.126 --> 05:04.052
Bulletin of the Agricultural and Environmental 
College of Texas of August 1914. It reads, the

05:04.072 --> 05:06.855
purpose of the team is to provide technical 
assistance to the urban population of Texas and

05:04.072 --> 05:06.855
solve the technological problems. of being 
assistance to Texas industries in solving such

05:07.088 --> 05:21.022
and such

05:07.088 --> 05:21.022
a problem, and disseminating the results of the 
research. Keep singing. Oh, yeah. Well, I

05:23.125 --> 05:28.630
researched that out of the archives when I first 
got here. You wanted to find out what your goals

05:28.650 --> 05:30.432
were. I wanted to find out what the goals were. And I 
don't really think they changed. I mean, our goals

05:34.038 --> 05:49.805
are still oriented to Texas because the Texas 
legislature provides us some of our tax dollars to

05:34.038 --> 05:49.805
help us

05:34.038 --> 05:49.805
develop the program. But we are nationally

05:51.388 --> 05:55.855
oriented also. Hello? OK. Where were we? Talking 
about Texas legislature. Oh, have the goals

06:04.029 --> 06:06.713
changed. I think we're both nationally and 
internationally oriented more than before.

06:13.143 --> 06:17.068
Because we've got more Aggies worldwide, too. And 
when those Arabs want to do some things like design

06:17.088 --> 06:26.522
a soccer stadium,

06:17.088 --> 06:26.522
Texas A&M wind tunnels, Yeah. They have 
prevailing winds over there on those deserts in

06:28.096 --> 06:33.843
the yard. And the design and orientation of that 
soccer field would have an effect on the winds

06:34.564 --> 06:40.510
carrying that soccer ball. So engineers are in 
petroleum production worldwide. They're in

06:48.319 --> 06:52.204
education worldwide. We've got some Aggie crops. 
Well,

06:56.118 --> 07:18.321
I think it's a positive. It's a plus, because I 
think the graduates of Texas A&M And

07:24.299 --> 07:53.648
I think, well, just take the environmental 
effects of building a dam. That project helped the

07:58.681 --> 08:09.004
federal government and EPA and everybody else 
assess whether or not they wanted to build a dam.

08:09.220 --> 08:16.531
They haven't built the dam because the water 
requirements for this area are not that great by

08:09.220 --> 08:16.531
now. They just want to keep their land because they 
thought they could get more money for it later. So

08:21.419 --> 08:28.349
later it's going to cost the state and the federal 
government more money to build a reservoir. But at

08:28.369 --> 08:36.021
any rate, all I'm saying is that our involvement in 
helping you solve the problem is a kind of . The last

08:36.710 --> 08:53.753
point I want to make is if you

08:36.710 --> 08:53.753
feel the change in directorship from Norton to 
Porter changed your job?

08:53.773 --> 09:02.886
Well, I think that Dr. Porter has a long-range 
vision.

09:07.726 --> 09:19.220
He's looking more

09:07.726 --> 09:19.220
to the national scene. He has given us some more 
challenges.

09:27.490 --> 09:29.532
I'm used to dancing with more freedom to do what you 
want to do. And that's what we

09:29.832 --> 09:35.739
did. And I still

09:35.939 --> 09:43.127
offer it a lot. I may be a quarter-time teacher, but 
there's

09:43.147 --> 09:54.000
some times when I'm studying full and working with 
teachers like I do in Washington, carrying the

09:43.147 --> 09:54.000
flag up there on the Engineering Research Center 
program, making it one of the designated research

09:43.147 --> 09:54.000
centers for students. that we can't win one

09:56.630 --> 10:02.279
of those. But at any rate, I do think that Dr. 
Porter, with his name, is good for people. I think

10:12.935 --> 10:20.427
there are, as I said, in any organization, those 
that resist and those that... We're

10:20.744 --> 10:42.564
having some problems right now deciding how we're 
going to do this. And it's a lot of waste of time.

10:43.244 --> 10:45.486
We've got to get back to remembering that this is 
Texas United. United we stand. We must be

10:45.847 --> 10:47.048
together. We must work for the common good. 
Everybody. I

10:51.457 --> 10:59.878
don't like this current concern about separate 
organizations. I don't think we're separate

10:59.898 --> 11:01.522
organizations. We are . We're not anything else. 
the separate organizations

11:06.020 --> 11:19.119
concerned, is that something that's coming from 
above in the administration or something that's

11:06.020 --> 11:19.119
coming from below in the individuals? Well, some

11:19.139 --> 11:27.691
of the... You never know what's coming. You know, 
it could come from... If Joe Doakes over here is a

11:29.138 --> 11:47.063
good, eloquent speaker, and he's sat in on lots of 
policy projects and is doing constructive

11:29.138 --> 11:47.063
research, and he's built himself up as a spokesman 
for the faculty. And he says, I don't like this

11:47.735 --> 11:51.299
organization. And he tells somebody else. He 
doesn't like this organization. Therefore, the

11:53.301 --> 11:57.166
organization is no good because Joe Doakes is an 
expert. Joe Doakes is no more of an expert

11:57.206 --> 12:02.151
than anybody else. But he's just more eloquent. 
And you've just got to take this whole spectrum

12:04.574 --> 12:11.181
of people. And if somebody doesn't want to work in 
the system, OK, don't. Get over here. Go to your

12:16.878 --> 12:22.005
coffee classes, but get out of our way and let us do 
our job. I think we've had some problems because we

12:23.186 --> 12:34.241
have shortages of people in the workplace. 
They've been hiring associate provosts I've

12:37.735 --> 12:50.801
been hiring this guy for I don't know how long. Too 
long. I haven't got it. The department of

12:51.783 --> 12:55.972
mechanical engineering now. Arrow is leaving. I

12:59.268 --> 13:27.064
guess

12:59.268 --> 13:27.064
so. There are some pros and there are some cons. But 
by and large, we need to get on with it and do it,

13:34.112 --> 13:37.135
whatever we're going to do. Is there anything else 
you'd like to add about your

13:37.155 --> 13:44.284
experiences with TEAS? Well, TEAS, in my view, is a 
fine organization.

13:50.452 --> 13:57.321
It's an organization designed to help people who 
want to develop themselves and their students. If

13:59.140 --> 14:16.542
there are

13:59.140 --> 14:16.542
people who do not want to promote Texas A&M and its 
students, then let them get out of the way unless a

13:59.140 --> 14:16.542
tease is oriented to helping solve problems of 
importance to the industries and the people of

13:59.140 --> 14:16.542
Texas. And part

14:16.522 --> 14:35.581
of

14:16.522 --> 14:35.581
that problem is making

14:16.522 --> 14:35.581
sure that the kids of our state get the right kind of 
education. And that means getting the right kind

14:35.601 --> 14:39.725
of professional

14:35.601 --> 14:39.725
development. Again, they should be involved in 
research. We can help them do that. So I'm just

14:41.206 --> 14:42.968
saying that these priorities, they can all work 
honestly in a dedicated way.

14:47.183 --> 14:51.389
Well, I hope you can get some of that into your 
history.

14:53.812 --> 14:55.174
Have you got all this stuff? Yeah, but I need to talk 
to him, too, and see what little things he didn't

14:55.194 --> 15:02.845
put into those.

15:03.145 --> 15:08.453
Don't emphasize any of the problems that I've 
gotten off on. I guess everybody gets off on them.

15:11.577 --> 15:15.182
Every organization's got problems, and if you 
don't have problems, nobody's going to believe

15:11.577 --> 15:15.182
good problems.
