WEBVTT

00:01.482 --> 00:08.409
detachment of forward air controllers stationed 
at the main. And there was a great deal of

00:08.430 --> 00:24.907
interaction, both radio and ground, between the 
American advisers to the Vietnamese, especially

00:08.430 --> 00:24.907
my group, and the facts. They would, on occasion, 
we'd bring them out and let them meet the and on

00:30.828 --> 00:52.030
occasion the Americans would go into Da Nang Air 
Force Base and talk to them on a social level rather

00:30.828 --> 00:52.030
than an operating level or business level, as you 
might think. Because they felt and we felt that it

00:53.091 --> 01:00.379
was desirable for us to know one another. and we 
became fairly close friends. And they would many

01:05.289 --> 01:18.148
times stretch their capability in protecting us 
if we needed assistance.

01:18.209 --> 01:23.717
On numerous occasions, we forward air 
controllers would go in with fumes in their tanks

01:24.592 --> 01:33.820
after knowing that they had just enough fuel to 
make it back to their home Air Force base. As long as

01:34.841 --> 01:52.557
we needed them and they could, they stayed on the 
station and were able to bring in either the C-130

01:34.841 --> 01:52.557
gunships or what they call the fast-movers, the 
fighter bombers. And on many occasions, I say that

01:52.992 --> 02:02.662
they saved lots of friendly lives by their 
dedication. And they were not particular,

02:03.263 --> 02:14.674
whether it was Vietnamese and American advisors 
on the ground or U.S. Marines on the ground. They

02:15.876 --> 02:22.122
stayed as long as they possibly could, so long as 
they could perform a service for us. As advisor to

02:24.025 --> 02:31.653
the 51st Army Regiment, specifically, what were 
your duties? As a battalion advisor, I assisted

02:32.414 --> 02:52.395
the battalion commander and his operations 
officer in planning operations, planning

02:32.414 --> 02:52.395
defenses, laying out the defenses that we felt 
were necessary in our home.

02:54.130 --> 03:20.391
operational area we had a barbed wire enclosure 
where we where we lived we built those with our own

02:54.130 --> 03:20.391
hands with sandbags and lumber and barbed wire and 
so forth i

02:54.130 --> 03:20.391
was the coordinator for artillery and the united 
states

03:23.425 --> 03:42.013
whether it be aviation helicopters or whether it 
be

03:23.425 --> 03:42.013
fighter bombers or gunships, the C-130 gunships I 
was talking about, the C-47 gunship. I'm sure you

03:42.033 --> 03:45.819
heard the nickname, Puff the Magic Dragon. Those 
were our responsibilities.

03:51.218 --> 03:59.428
in our area of operation all the Marine artillery 
fire. By that I mean before the Marines fired

03:59.448 --> 04:08.999
artillery fire within our area, they would call us 
and ask us if we had friendly troops within the

03:59.448 --> 04:08.999
area. And we coordinated with the Vietnamese. We 
would, for instance, if the Marine battalion

04:18.809 --> 04:40.714
commander or operations officer came to our

04:18.809 --> 04:40.714
Tactical Operations Center to coordinate 
something, we would sit in on it and make sure that

04:18.809 --> 04:40.714
there were no mistakes about who was going to do 
what and where. By the same token, if we, the

04:40.734 --> 04:45.880
battalion commander and I, are My operations 
officer went to the Marine Battalion Operations

04:46.315 --> 04:53.422
Center. We'd go along and make sure that there were 
no mistakes in communications. We were, I suppose

04:57.846 --> 05:03.411
you might say, facilitators of communications. 
We suggested to the battalion commander, I did,

05:04.031 --> 05:14.601
and later to the regimental commander and 
operations officer, areas that it would be

05:15.205 --> 05:19.169
advisable to operate in.

05:22.913 --> 05:42.293
We were also tasked for something that I never 
really cared for, but it seemed to be a fact of life,

05:22.913 --> 05:42.293
and that is attempting to persuade a battalion 
commander to do something at the request of the

05:43.268 --> 05:58.255
regimental advisor or perhaps the court advisor, 
that we should do some sort of thing that they had

05:43.268 --> 05:58.255
not been used to doing. We were his artillery 
planner also. With all the troops there at that

06:06.370 --> 06:16.564
time, what do you feel was the impact of their 
presence on the Vietnamese society, culture, and

06:06.370 --> 06:16.564
economy?

06:26.017 --> 06:35.550
The

06:26.017 --> 06:35.550
number of troops contributed significantly to 
inflation. It contributed somewhat to the moral

06:36.627 --> 06:51.482
decay of certain elements of the Vietnamese 
populace.

06:51.502 --> 07:03.934
It contributed a great deal to the modernization 
and Honda-ization of the streets of the major

06:51.502 --> 07:03.934
cities.

07:07.238 --> 07:20.339
It

07:07.238 --> 07:20.339
did not favorably affect the Vietnamese 
civilization as such. However, I don't believe

07:20.420 --> 07:31.778
that it harmed it as much as some might have 
thought.

07:33.412 --> 07:41.446
Modernization, I believe, probably outweighed 
the moral decay and the modernization.

07:43.610 --> 07:44.972
I really believe that it did.

07:48.058 --> 07:56.753
You mentioned in your first tour that you were 
working, you were trying to develop cottage

07:48.058 --> 07:56.753
industries or to bring industry to the 
Montagnards. Were you able to see at this point in

07:57.526 --> 08:08.155
time any results of that attempt, of the American 
attempts at industrialization in Vietnam? I was

08:09.276 --> 08:27.432
never fortunate enough to be able to go back again 
to any of the places that I had been before, except

08:09.276 --> 08:27.432
the area around and just south of Da Nang and south 
of Marble Mountain. It was actually a number of

08:28.154 --> 08:34.645
marble up-thrusts. And the only areas that I was 
able to actually visit again that I had worked in

08:35.566 --> 08:50.210
before were the electricity in the south of Marble 
Mountain. And I can't give you an answer that you

08:50.230 --> 08:53.976
asked for.

09:00.385 --> 09:03.509
What did the men do in Vietnam for R&R? Were the 
five-day R&Rs morale boosting or successful?

09:11.138 --> 09:16.364
You're referring to the... Rest and relaxation.

09:18.747 --> 09:23.012
The in-country R&R, I never took one. I don't, and I 
never had the opportunity to know anyone who

09:27.858 --> 09:30.401
really did. I believe some of the Marines might 
have. There was an R&R, Marine R&R area on the beach

09:33.944 --> 09:42.333
at the name. China Beach? Yes, China Beach. I was 
there and it was, when I say I was there, that was

09:48.159 --> 09:56.127
where the exchange was. and the Navy Exchange or 
Army Air Force Exchange, I'm not sure which. There

10:03.953 --> 10:07.517
was one there, and I was there a few times. I 
primarily went to the Exchange at the name Air

10:08.218 --> 10:12.624
Force Base. But it was right next to the orphanage 
that I had worked with. But again, it was off limits

10:20.634 --> 10:24.679
to U.S. troops by this time. and I was in a different 
category, and I could not even go downtown without

10:25.165 --> 10:36.605
special permission from the, I guess, Air Force 
provost marshal. I'm not sure who was in charge of

10:36.625 --> 10:45.942
the name, but I did not wish to become involved in an 
incident. So I did not visit my friends for a couple

10:46.327 --> 10:56.280
of times during that period of time because they 
knew as well as I. But I did get to see them on

10:57.041 --> 11:11.119
frequent occasions at the McVie Officers Club 
where this missionary, Mr. Smith, was able to come

10:57.041 --> 11:11.119
and get his mail. And he was

11:11.403 --> 11:36.466
given special privileges because of his 
nationality and the fact that he had helped the

11:11.403 --> 11:36.466
friendly forces from time to time in interfacing 
with the local government. Back to the R&R.

11:42.166 --> 12:02.385
For instance, during my tour in 68 and 69, for 
myself and the people who worked with me, that you

11:42.166 --> 12:02.385
could see the different physical condition of the 
people when they came back. And I know myself that

12:02.765 --> 12:11.093
the rest and relaxation was a tremendous to

12:11.478 --> 12:18.746
renew the physical animal. Where did they go when 
they went out of country? As I recall, we had R&R

12:24.552 --> 12:39.308
centers in Australia, Bangkok, Hong Kong, Japan, 
and Hawaii. There may have been more, but I don't

12:39.811 --> 12:45.096
remember. I took my own R&R to Hawaii in 1968-69.

12:59.170 --> 13:05.956
During the 1968-69 R&R, it was not as bad. The 
publicity was not as bad. in Hawaii because Hawaii

13:10.439 --> 13:30.246
is a military environment because of the 
tremendous number of military that have been

13:10.439 --> 13:30.246
there historically since prior to World War II. 
It's been a Navy installation, it's been an Army

13:30.266 --> 13:38.117
installation, and it's been a Marine Corps 
installation. population of the Hawaiian

13:39.025 --> 14:08.020
Islands, in my opinion, is heavily militarized, 
meaning that there are ex-servicemen,

13:39.025 --> 14:08.020
servicemen, wives, parents, relatives, and so 
forth, and probably would not – did not represent a

13:39.025 --> 14:08.020
true picture of the civilian world. I think

14:09.637 --> 14:30.517
probably I

14:09.637 --> 14:30.517
did not, and I think you're leading towards 
something. How did the exposure to the U.S.

14:30.537 --> 14:39.306
civilian affect the people who went on R&R? And it 
did not bother most of us because we were not

14:40.197 --> 14:55.179
exposed to the screams of baby killer,

14:40.197 --> 14:55.179
criminal, murder, death, theft, and so forth at 
that time. Not on Hawaii. It might have been

14:57.843 --> 15:09.360
different had we come back all the way to the 
continent of the United States. morale

15:10.117 --> 15:16.865
degrading thing. It was a restful renewal.

15:22.611 --> 15:24.333
Is this what was the stack arms? Is that part of the 
program? I'm not familiar with the term as being a

15:28.819 --> 15:31.902
program. I know the term stack arms has been around 
the military for all my adult life that i know of the

15:40.002 --> 16:04.339
military and it means quit it just means quit this 
whatever we're doing back home and of course you

15:40.002 --> 16:04.339
you do know that this is a command and it means 
exactly that you stack your arms and leave them for

15:40.002 --> 16:04.339
whatever reason and

16:09.820 --> 16:17.268
How was your ability to communicate with the 
Vietnamese at this point in time? And how

16:17.288 --> 16:18.910
important do you think it was?

16:22.013 --> 16:33.545
By this point in time, most of the officers, if not 
100% of them, were able to speak English. And even

16:34.706 --> 16:38.190
though I had gone to language school, a longer 
course at the Defense Language Institute to learn

16:38.660 --> 16:47.571
Vietnamese. They seemed to trust their English 
better than they trusted my Vietnamese. And I

16:53.978 --> 17:04.431
believe this was true with all of the officers that 
I knew during that period of time. A few of them

17:05.069 --> 17:08.474
spoke broken English. Most of them spoke 
grammatically correct, if not totally literate

17:08.494 --> 17:18.308
English. They, with some few exceptions, they 
spoke with a heavy accent, but they were

17:18.328 --> 17:26.741
understandable. My Vietnamese was poor, to say 
the least. I was able to communicate with the

17:33.740 --> 17:43.594
lower-ranking individuals on a very basic level.

17:46.798 --> 18:02.380
And in many cases, in fact most cases, dealing with 
the Vietnamese private PFC, it was a mixture of

17:46.798 --> 18:02.380
Pidgin English, Pidgin Vietnamese, and some 
French. They

18:03.136 --> 18:14.232
knew, in most cases, some French, but I didn't know 
much French. After

18:14.853 --> 18:32.738
we began to become acquainted with one another,

18:14.853 --> 18:32.738
we were able to communicate with sign language. 
words that were common to both of us. And as a last

18:37.522 --> 18:54.312
resort, I was able to, in most cases, write out in 
Vietnamese what I wanted or what I needed to

18:37.522 --> 18:54.312
convey.

18:55.313 --> 18:57.477
I did understand enough was able to write enough 
Vietnamese, even though my accent was probably

18:58.148 --> 19:10.791
atrocious, to convey simple thoughts.

19:13.416 --> 19:17.303
What about troop rotation and command rotation? 
Do you think there were too many officers in

19:17.463 --> 19:19.827
Vietnam? Did the troops... In other words, did the 
troops rotate too frequently or frequently

19:23.410 --> 19:29.818
enough, or were there not enough troops, or were 
there too many? It's been said that there were too

19:30.278 --> 19:33.422
many officers in Vietnam. Do you feel that way? How 
did the committee rotate? The officers that

19:39.569 --> 19:45.316
enlisted were officially rotated on the same 
schedule. One year in country was all it took.

19:53.296 --> 20:04.069
There was

19:53.296 --> 20:04.069
no particular problem

19:53.296 --> 20:04.069
that I saw.

20:06.913 --> 20:23.033
The statistics, as I recall reading, was that the 
support base was tremendous in accordance with

20:06.913 --> 20:23.033
the actual

20:06.913 --> 20:23.033
troop on the ground. But at the same time, you'll 
have to remember that this was a Charlie.

20:34.499 --> 20:48.413
The aviation assets were used to support all 
forces, and we were supporting both the U.S.

20:34.499 --> 20:48.413
military, the Vietnamese military, At least one 
case, the Korean military with aviation assets,

20:48.848 --> 21:15.953
and they are very much maintenance and 
support-oriented, meaning that for one pilot

20:48.848 --> 21:15.953
you're going to have 10 to 15, at least 10 to 15 
people working on that aircraft and bringing in

20:48.848 --> 21:15.953
support, whether it be mechanics, armorers, or 
electronics experts. I don't believe that the

21:17.671 --> 21:37.651
great support required in this particular war, or 
the support that we had in this war, would be much

21:17.671 --> 21:37.651
different from any other guerrilla-type war that 
we would fight. Perhaps, yes, it was overburdened

21:39.352 --> 21:46.159
with service. troops in only one area, and that was 
the area of comfort and supply, the exchanges and,

21:46.392 --> 22:03.854
of course, the amount of transportation that is 
required to bring in the beer, cigarettes, and

21:46.392 --> 22:03.854
nice things to eat. But at the same time, it's what 
we were more or less used to and what we wanted, and

22:03.954 --> 22:15.589
the people in command People at higher levels felt 
that it was desirable to do so. I can't fault them

22:25.441 --> 22:33.088
for it because I personally took advantage of the 
comfort items when I could get them. Realizing as

22:34.110 --> 22:43.399
you do that I spent that particular tour with the 
Vietnamese. And without those comfort items, I

22:44.223 --> 22:53.114
don't know that I would have been as an effective 
soldier as I was. Now, I will have to say that on many

22:53.134 --> 23:01.103
occasions and instances, I shared those comfort 
items with the Vietnamese. And at the same time,

23:02.044 --> 23:06.349
they shared what they had with me. I ate their rice 
and weeds, and they didn't particularly like my

23:06.369 --> 23:12.677
sea rations. But we existed together.

23:19.584 --> 23:21.706
Do you feel the reserves should have been called 
up?

23:28.453 --> 23:30.575
Tactically, strategically, no. However, 
politically, yes. I believe that if the reserves

23:34.759 --> 23:42.546
had been called up, that the political situation 
as it later I believe

23:42.998 --> 24:01.935
that the chain bondage of the world and of the 
United States would have been a

24:03.687 --> 24:22.858
The fact that we fought this war with new 
conscripts, new draftees, and with regular

24:03.687 --> 24:22.858
soldiers

24:03.687 --> 24:22.858
was very distasteful to many of the 
political-minded people of the United States. I

24:22.878 --> 24:30.370
believe that had the reserves been called up and 
possibly have shortened the involvement that the

24:31.042 --> 24:34.866
political situation would have been different. 
To what extent or how it would have been different,

24:34.886 --> 24:39.191
I do not know. Possibly the dissatisfaction would 
have come along quicker and caused a more

24:39.211 --> 24:58.433
intensive effort, or whether it would have 
resulted in the people of the United States as a

24:39.211 --> 24:58.433
whole being stronger behind our military, I don't 
know. It's a question that I have no firm opinions

25:03.208 --> 25:12.702
on either way.

25:12.722 --> 25:17.990
The last tour that you had in Vietnam was from 
December 1971 to 72. You were the personnel and

25:18.991 --> 25:24.960
administrative advisor to 7th ARVN Division in 
4th Corps ARVN. What was the difference between

25:26.240 --> 25:33.790
being an advisor in the north and in the south?

25:33.810 --> 25:42.622
The...

25:33.810 --> 25:42.622
Again, this was a totally different terrain.

25:45.145 --> 25:55.820
In the north, we had some lowland rice paddy areas, 
primarily mountainous jungle.

25:55.840 --> 25:55.960
In the In the south, we're talking of marsh, swamp, 
and rice bedding. Were the people and troops

26:04.807 --> 26:07.611
different? The people were about the same.

26:14.019 --> 26:23.230
There was a sprinkling of Cambodians, ethnic 
Cambodians,

26:14.019 --> 26:23.230
in the south. quite a number of the soldiers were 
head of Cambodian. They spoke Vietnamese and

26:30.909 --> 26:33.171
Cambodian. And you could tell the difference by 
appearance. Primarily they were less oriental

26:37.716 --> 26:50.348
and more

26:37.716 --> 26:50.348
Malay. experience a little bit darker in 
complexion. But I would say that they had a little

26:55.769 --> 27:14.573
greater

26:55.769 --> 27:14.573
hatred of the NBA, the North Vietnamese Army.

27:14.593 --> 27:17.837
They were a little bit more loyal appearing to me to 
the Saigon government. Now, the people,

27:22.895 --> 27:48.263
in all cases, in my experience, had no great love 
for any government, whether it be the Saigon

27:22.895 --> 27:48.263
government, the NDA, the North Vietnamese 
government, or the Viet Cong shadow government.

27:49.255 --> 28:02.650
As I intimated earlier on, they were loyal to their 
family, their extended family, and their village

27:49.255 --> 28:02.650
to some extent. But one must realize where their 
loyalties were. The primary ambitions of all the

28:09.437 --> 28:18.908
Vietnamese that I knew

28:22.752 --> 28:37.808
except for the military, was to raise, grow rice, 
kids, and adults, and to have their rice bowl full

28:22.752 --> 28:37.808
every day. That is about the epitome of the local 
peasant. Leave me alone, let me grow my children,

28:42.633 --> 28:51.342
raise my children, grow my rice, and keep my rice 
bowl full. And there did not appear to be much

28:52.469 --> 29:02.922
ambition beyond this, those that, the Vietnamese 
children that I knew. The school teachers, of

29:04.384 --> 29:20.485
course, were wanting to impart their imprint upon 
the younger children and to educate them as much as

29:04.384 --> 29:20.485
they could. the Vietnamese had a high regard for 
education, except for the very poorest and most

29:20.870 --> 29:40.877
backward peasants who felt that taking his 
working-age child away from him and putting him

29:20.870 --> 29:40.877
into school was not exactly what was necessary. He 
needed to be out planting the rice or

29:40.897 --> 29:44.782
transplanting the rice. And of course, this was a 
common occurrence.

29:52.645 --> 29:56.090
How about the Arvin troops that you worked with? 
Were they better or worse or any different from the

29:56.110 --> 30:02.419
ones you worked with before? Again, we're talking 
about the overall

30:02.439 --> 30:15.218
throughout the division. And again, the manpower 
base and the manpower pool is getting shallower

30:15.238 --> 30:22.028
still. And again, we're getting people who are 
less well-educated, not well-educated at all.

30:35.524 --> 30:38.407
We're getting the pest. So the quality is 
deteriorating. The overall quality of the new

30:40.649 --> 30:47.156
troop is beginning to deteriorate. And I won't say 
that it was... something that was

30:52.585 --> 31:14.715
terribly important at that time because

30:52.585 --> 31:14.715
in most cases it did not take a tremendous amount of 
intelligence nor education to carry a right.

31:15.937 --> 31:17.479
We found that We were beginning to receive nothing 
but conscripts, and none of them wanted to be

31:18.202 --> 31:26.910
there. Again, as you probably have heard, it was 
impossible to tell by looking at a young conscript

31:26.930 --> 31:47.550
whether he had sent these towards the VidCon, 
whether he had sent these towards the Saigon

31:26.930 --> 31:47.550
government, or none whatsoever. And we're 
talking about 1971 and 72,

31:48.745 --> 32:01.039
three years after the Tet Offensive.

32:02.140 --> 32:06.806
Most of them would just as soon not be where they 
were. They would prefer to be back on the rice paddy

32:07.927 --> 32:18.499
or back in Saigon or one of the larger cities doing 
something else. They were a fairly effective

32:19.930 --> 32:32.547
fighting force if properly led, and this was 
always the problem. As I may have stated before,

32:32.567 --> 32:45.685
they were not as

32:32.567 --> 32:45.685
eager, the officers, in command were not as eager 
to pursue the battle because they knew that if they

32:46.542 --> 33:04.598
lost a soldier or a large number of soldiers that 
they had to bring in new conscripts and new people.

33:04.618 --> 33:11.364
They knew that they were not going to leave Vietnam 
in 12 months. They knew that they were going to be

33:18.082 --> 33:45.034
military and with a long record of military 
service, they knew that their success in the

33:18.082 --> 33:45.034
military, and that was their chosen profession, 
though this time many of them they had no other, and

33:18.082 --> 33:45.034
they knew that their entire lives would be spent in 
the military, and that the loss of men was not going

33:18.082 --> 33:45.034
to reflect well on the

33:49.874 --> 33:58.202
as well as the officers realizing and the NCOs, 
too, realizing that they were mortal. Whereas

33:59.443 --> 34:09.672
many of our officers, the U.S. officers did not at 
that time realize how mortal they really were. I'm

34:09.692 --> 34:18.700
referring primarily to the Lutonians and 
Captains that developed mortality only, or

34:19.523 --> 34:24.971
realization of mortality only came late within 
their tour. And sometimes even the second tour

34:25.012 --> 34:33.965
before they began to realize that, hey, I can get 
killed in this mess too. Whereas the Vietnamese

34:33.985 --> 34:44.602
were thoroughly aware of that

34:33.985 --> 34:44.602
situation. Do you feel that they lost their own 
home?

34:50.270 --> 34:52.532
In effect, yes.

34:54.334 --> 35:01.660
The Vietnamese lost the war and the United States 
lost the war. And I can't place the blame on either

35:01.680 --> 35:09.988
the United States nor the Vietnamese.

35:14.052 --> 35:20.057
I would say that the Vietnamese lost the war 
because of corruption at all levels, starting at

35:21.218 --> 35:51.040
the presidential level, corruption favoritism,

35:21.218 --> 35:51.040
nepotism, because they were looking out for 
themselves and not even at the highest level did

35:21.218 --> 35:51.040
the officer or civilian official really have 
totally the best interest of their country at

35:51.965 --> 35:58.230
heart. They had always in the backs of their minds, 
in my belief, in my opinion, they were looking out

35:59.952 --> 36:08.799
for number one. The United States lost their war 
for whatever reason. I will very briefly say that

36:17.166 --> 36:21.870
the United States lost the war because of lack of 
resolution to win the war. And if you would like me

36:31.692 --> 36:51.773
to expand on that, it was a combination of the 
protestors, the very, very loud protesting

36:31.692 --> 36:51.773
minority, and the lack of resolution to go against 
that local minority by our civilians and

36:52.698 --> 37:22.587
sometimes our military leaders, and allowing a 
sanctuary to exist across a black line on a map that

36:52.698 --> 37:22.587
does not exist on the ground, whether it be North 
Vietnam

37:24.592 --> 37:28.256
across the border into Laos or Cambodia. There 
were occasions, as you know, where those black

37:28.276 --> 37:51.038
lines were ignored, those artificial lines were 
ignored, and the U.S. pursued the NVA to their

37:28.276 --> 37:51.038
sanctuary and in some cases was successful in 
destroying that sanctuary, not totally. It was

37:51.743 --> 38:08.706
the lack of resolution to destroy

37:51.743 --> 38:08.706
North Vietnam at the time that they could have been 
destroyed. The

38:08.726 --> 38:19.962
bombing of North Vietnam could have been very 
successful had it been carried out with a total

38:20.971 --> 38:33.547
effort, a total effort using what we had 
available, rather than a half-hearted attempt or

38:20.971 --> 38:33.547
as a warning. You do, if you don't stop doing this, 
we're going to start bombing again, that type of

38:34.248 --> 38:43.219
thing. The effort should have been, and I believe 
that We could have won the war by, number one,

38:46.402 --> 39:12.190
Congress declaring war against North Vietnam, 
against North Vietnam for violating the CETO

38:46.402 --> 39:12.190
treaties, that is, engaging in warfare against 
our fellow treaty signers of South Vietnam, Laos,

38:46.402 --> 39:12.190
Cambodia, whatever.

39:15.258 --> 39:24.270
had we declared war against North Vietnam, we 
would have then had the opportunity to actually

39:15.258 --> 39:24.270
invade North Vietnam. I do not believe that such as 
North Vietnam and subsequently invaded South

39:25.071 --> 39:44.556
Vietnam, I do not believe that

39:25.071 --> 39:44.556
we should have tied our own hands to such an extent 
that we did. I believe that a war once started

39:46.392 --> 39:57.344
should be pursued with vigor wherever the enemy 
is. In your opinion, what way was the military

39:58.225 --> 40:14.003
responsible

39:58.225 --> 40:14.003
for the loss? I want me to pin it to one particular 
thing. Perhaps the measurement of success or

40:21.349 --> 40:32.481
failure of an operation depending upon body 
count. Body count and the allied

40:32.501 --> 40:45.255
things that go with it In many cases, the only means 
of measuring the only yardstick against which a

40:46.147 --> 40:56.840
commander was measured was body count. And to me, 
being a more or less conventional soldier, I still

40:56.860 --> 41:09.235
believe in taking the high ground and hold it. 
attack where they're weakest and defend when they

41:11.982 --> 41:21.276
attack and don't give an inch. But this was not the 
manner in which the

41:21.296 --> 41:36.257
U.S. civilian government determined that we 
should fight and win the war. And again, it was a The

41:39.843 --> 41:58.779
thing that the United States military, I'm 
talking about all services, and the Vietnamese

41:39.843 --> 41:58.779
were more or less hamstrung in being denied the 
opportunity to go where they were.

41:58.799 --> 42:01.982
When we knew where they were, we couldn't always go 
to them. What did you think of defoliation?

42:11.298 --> 42:23.068
I only had one opportunity, and before I was able to 
arrange my only one opportunity where it was

42:11.298 --> 42:23.068
needed, and that was at Camp Nandong in July of 
1964. I was going to obtain some decodient for the

42:23.588 --> 42:31.735
camp that was there. And unfortunately, it was 
attacked and overwhelmed, and the camp was closed

42:31.755 --> 42:41.203
before I could get The overall

42:41.808 --> 43:06.156
program of defoliation, I saw some of the results

42:41.808 --> 43:06.156
in the Delta IV Corps, and it didn't do a whole lot of 
good. I was in and out of the areas before, during,

43:06.176 --> 43:11.562
and after the defoliation. And while it took the 
leaves off the trees and killed the rice paddy and

43:11.862 --> 43:27.478
whatever, it did not result, in my opinion, of 
winning the war. I don't think it lost it. I think

43:29.320 --> 43:31.583
the idea was good. But unfortunately, Vietnam is a 
pretty good place, a pretty good-sized place. and

43:39.031 --> 43:44.216
it was just impossible to defoliate everything 
everywhere they were. And I believe that it could

43:45.257 --> 43:53.646
possibly have been used with much greater effect 
along the Ho Chi Minh Trail. I think it would

43:54.667 --> 44:08.481
probably have been able to

43:54.667 --> 44:08.481
have been more successful had we operated 
branches along the the area along

44:09.946 --> 44:16.593
the – in Laos. Had we done it in Laos, where the Ho Chi 
Minh Trail came into out of North Vietnam into the

44:17.054 --> 44:39.598
area west of South Vietnam, I think we could have 
probably devoted a lot more there of the

44:17.054 --> 44:39.598
defoliant, and it would have been more 
successful. it would have probably made the Ho Chi

44:40.152 --> 44:50.943
Minh Trail more vulnerable to bottom attack and so 
forth. Overall, what kind of military tactics

44:50.963 --> 44:59.031
were used?

45:01.174 --> 45:05.438
That covers the whole spectrum. From time to time, 
during During the summer offensive in 1972,

45:10.882 --> 45:27.422
as I recall, or summer defensive, depending on 
which way you're looking at it, we had actual

45:10.882 --> 45:27.422
World War II.
