WEBVTT

00:02.765 --> 00:06.088
The bonfire was held on the drill field.

00:06.348 --> 00:06.669
Right.

00:06.689 --> 00:08.350
In that era, what was there?

00:08.511 --> 00:09.812
There was no MSC.

00:09.892 --> 00:10.973
No MSC, no.

00:11.694 --> 00:13.415
Was the Cope building there in those days?

00:13.776 --> 00:14.977
No, no.

00:14.997 --> 00:19.641
So the Y. There was Guyon Hall and Goodwin Hall.

00:19.841 --> 00:20.742
And Goodwin.

00:20.762 --> 00:20.902
Yeah.

00:21.823 --> 00:25.227
And then the Y, YMCA.

00:26.468 --> 00:26.788
Yeah.

00:27.869 --> 00:29.751
Well, on the military walk,

00:30.777 --> 00:35.468
There was Ross Hall and it was Foster Hall, I'm not sure what the other.

00:35.488 --> 00:39.116
Ross Hall was where the military science, the commandant was located.

00:40.419 --> 00:43.867
But that wasn't on the same, that was on Military Walk.

00:44.128 --> 00:46.373
It was that street in front of that where we had,

00:46.353 --> 00:50.661
not Guyon Hall, but Goodwin Hall and some other.

00:50.681 --> 00:56.933
And then down at the end there was Guyon Hall where the Rudder Tower is now.

00:56.953 --> 00:57.574
Right in that area.

00:57.594 --> 01:02.303
So that the real western edge of the campus was the drill field.

01:03.076 --> 01:06.961
Well, there was a dairy... But, I mean, that was way across the railroad.

01:07.001 --> 01:07.722
Yeah, across the track.

01:07.742 --> 01:09.163
You had a dairy husband.

01:09.183 --> 01:11.727
There was the train station was down there, you know.

01:11.747 --> 01:14.390
And was the railroad station a comparatively busy place?

01:14.710 --> 01:16.492
Were there people coming and going pretty well?

01:16.512 --> 01:17.614
Yeah, there were people coming and going.

01:17.634 --> 01:20.077
But, you know, I don't know that I ever rode the train out of here.

01:21.018 --> 01:22.380
I can't think of it.

01:22.480 --> 01:24.382
No reason to go over there and hang out or anything?

01:24.462 --> 01:25.123
No, no, no.

01:25.183 --> 01:26.805
It was just a regular train station.

01:26.988 --> 01:30.654
Now, where did you and your buddies go get something to eat or drink?

01:30.674 --> 01:33.779
Well, like I said, we never did eat out anywhere.

01:34.200 --> 01:35.602
Oh, but on campus, didn't you?

01:35.722 --> 01:37.185
Oh, well, it was at George's.

01:37.245 --> 01:40.149
They had, you could eat there.

01:40.951 --> 01:48.102
And then there was something, I was thinking there was something over in the YMCA, but I'm not sure, some kind of snack bar or something over there.

01:48.823 --> 01:51.628
And how often did you go to a movie at Galleon?

01:51.828 --> 01:54.612
Oh, we went to the movie a lot.

01:54.632 --> 01:59.439
And when I started my sophomore year, I started working on the Aggieland.

02:00.121 --> 02:00.822
Oh.

02:00.842 --> 02:07.071
And people in student publications, they would give them free tickets to Guyon Hall.

02:07.111 --> 02:09.094
So I always had a bunch of free tickets to it.

02:09.479 --> 02:10.661
Guy and Hall.

02:10.682 --> 02:11.243
Right now.

02:11.784 --> 02:13.968
It'll cost a dime, I think, to go through it or something like that.

02:13.988 --> 02:17.396
Were you involved when the Longhorn name changed?

02:17.596 --> 02:18.318
Yes, yes.

02:18.558 --> 02:20.041
I wasn't involved, but I was here.

02:20.242 --> 02:21.324
How did that come about?

02:21.404 --> 02:24.771
Well, it's like any other change at A&M that's going to be, you know,

02:24.751 --> 02:32.159
A&M's going to hell, and we may not survive this, and like all these, like the women coming in.

02:32.780 --> 02:35.703
Do you remember whose idea it was to change?

02:36.384 --> 02:37.045
No, I don't.

02:37.165 --> 02:39.287
I was a sophomore.

02:39.347 --> 02:42.471
I was thinking there was an election, but I'm not sure.

02:42.491 --> 02:47.316
I was thinking there was a student election that changed it, but it was very controversial.

02:47.336 --> 02:51.501
You know, it was like, boy, old Army's gone to hell.

02:51.667 --> 02:54.149
Describe working on the Aggieland.

02:54.169 --> 03:01.776
Well, it was, when I was working at a sophomore and a junior, it was just going over there one afternoon a week.

03:02.777 --> 03:03.938
Where was the office?

03:03.958 --> 03:04.879
It was in Goodwin Hall.

03:04.939 --> 03:06.760
In Goodwin.

03:06.780 --> 03:11.284
And we'd go over and we'd, you know, paste up and do things and just, you know.

03:11.865 --> 03:14.147
Who was the sponsor, do you remember?

03:14.167 --> 03:14.367
Yep.

03:15.047 --> 03:21.353
And he wound up as president of Victoria College.

03:22.582 --> 03:23.707
What was his name?

03:24.772 --> 03:26.258
I thought over here just a while back.

03:26.720 --> 03:27.885
I can't think of it right now.

03:28.689 --> 03:30.617
Was he a faculty member?

03:30.850 --> 03:33.653
No, he was in charge of student publications.

03:33.673 --> 03:33.914
Oh, okay.

03:33.954 --> 03:36.657
And he kind of, kind of had a, kind of hunchback.

03:37.878 --> 03:37.998
Okay.

03:38.018 --> 03:39.119
I can't think of his name.

03:39.540 --> 03:41.262
And what led you to get involved in that?

03:41.702 --> 03:47.028
Well, I just wanted to, you know, be involved in some kind of student, do things.

03:47.109 --> 03:51.373
And somebody I knew worked over there, and they told me ought to come over.

03:51.414 --> 03:52.575
But that was your sophomore year?

03:52.835 --> 03:53.856
Sophomore year, yeah.

03:53.876 --> 03:58.802
All right, during your freshman year, do you remember going to Silver Taps the first time?

03:58.822 --> 03:59.743
Oh, yeah, yeah.

03:59.723 --> 04:01.465
What were your feelings when you first went?

04:02.066 --> 04:02.587
I don't know.

04:02.867 --> 04:03.869
I was very impressed.

04:03.929 --> 04:07.313
I know there was always an emotional, emotional thing there.

04:07.333 --> 04:14.563
But we didn't have, you know, we didn't have Silver Taps too many times because there were only about 9,000 students here at that time.

04:14.983 --> 04:18.568
And very few people had cars.

04:19.189 --> 04:21.913
So that brought your risk factor down quite a bit.

04:21.993 --> 04:24.516
In fact in my outfit I can

04:25.087 --> 04:30.657
I think there were only one or two guys that had a car, and we were never sure, you know, where he got it.

04:31.920 --> 04:37.009
But they were just, like in an outfit of 50 people, there'd be one or two cars.

04:37.130 --> 04:38.252
They didn't have much money.

04:38.652 --> 04:40.255
Didn't have any money, you know.

04:40.275 --> 04:43.802
So you didn't go off campus much, you know.

04:43.822 --> 04:46.487
We'd go into Bryan and go to the movie.

04:47.277 --> 04:49.140
But we didn't, we didn't eat it.

04:49.340 --> 04:52.825
It was, I mean, it was rare that anybody ever ate out anywhere.

04:52.866 --> 05:00.477
Now we'd go down in that deluxe cafe sometimes in Bryan and have a sandwich or something there.

05:01.258 --> 05:04.003
Did you walk much to the North Gate or South Gate?

05:04.363 --> 05:04.704
Oh, yeah.

05:04.804 --> 05:06.506
Walk everywhere you... No, no.

05:06.567 --> 05:09.811
I mean, did you go to those North Gate or South Gate much?

05:09.832 --> 05:11.774
Oh, you'd go up there to the cleaners.

05:11.795 --> 05:13.437
You'd go up there to get a haircut.

05:14.378 --> 05:16.804
You might go up there to go to the drug store.

05:16.844 --> 05:18.908
There was a drug store where Lupo's is now.

05:19.670 --> 05:27.308
You might go up there to do that, but there wasn't anything up there except, you know, a bookstore and there was a barber shop and a few things like that.

05:27.328 --> 05:28.851
Did you go up there to church?

05:29.272 --> 05:30.936
Did you do any business with Lupo?

05:31.439 --> 05:32.421
I'm sure I did.

05:32.721 --> 05:35.066
But you didn't ever borrow money from me?

05:35.086 --> 05:35.587
No, no, no.

05:36.549 --> 05:39.775
I knew better than that.

05:41.057 --> 05:42.400
You said you went to church up there.

05:42.440 --> 05:43.081
Describe that.

05:43.382 --> 05:47.430
Well, I went to the Church of Christ there at the North Gate.

05:48.171 --> 05:51.878
My freshman year, I was very religious.

05:52.786 --> 05:56.772
because through religion you could get out a lot of things.

05:56.792 --> 06:02.039
And we had a guy named Newt Cole who was a senior, and he wound up a preacher.

06:02.079 --> 06:06.345
He was preaching at that time and wound up a chaplain in the Air Force.

06:06.365 --> 06:10.471
But he would have, for the freshman, he would have Bible study.

06:11.393 --> 06:19.084
Well, you know, any time he wanted to have Bible study, we'd go because the sophomores couldn't get at us if we were down there at Bible study.

06:19.644 --> 06:22.168
So maybe that's kind of a bad way

06:22.638 --> 06:26.982
Had religion, but we were sure a bunch of religious freshmen.

06:27.402 --> 06:36.330
And we'd go to, you know, a lot of time we'd go up to Northgate to a religious service of some kind just to get away, you know.

06:36.350 --> 06:37.772
Did you go to Sunday school and church?

06:37.892 --> 06:40.634
No, I didn't go to Sunday school, but I went to church on Sunday normally.

06:40.694 --> 06:41.615
What about Sunday night?

06:42.896 --> 06:47.280
Well, it all depended on what was going on around the dormitory.

06:47.360 --> 06:49.442
Freshmen, I mean, the sophomore were on a rage.

06:49.482 --> 06:51.244
Well, man, I got religion.

06:51.224 --> 06:53.467
and I would go to church.

06:53.487 --> 07:01.798
Because I went to Austin College, and the reason we went to Sunday night Westminster Fellowship was because there was a free supper.

07:02.118 --> 07:03.640
Yeah, well, we didn't have any free suppers.

07:03.740 --> 07:07.465
And the cafeteria didn't serve supper on Sunday night.

07:07.866 --> 07:09.247
Was there a Wednesday night prayer meeting?

07:10.088 --> 07:19.020
I think that probably, they probably had them at, you know, like I said, circumstances would dictate whether you would, that was a long walk to the North Gate, you know.

07:19.102 --> 07:21.665
And I presume the congregation was comparatively small.

07:21.865 --> 07:22.146
Yes.

07:22.706 --> 07:23.628
Yeah.

07:23.648 --> 07:27.192
Now, World War II veterans must have been here in large numbers.

07:27.252 --> 07:31.357
What role did they play in the student body and activities and so forth?

07:31.377 --> 07:33.920
Well, they were a lot of them.

07:33.940 --> 07:36.924
They were active in like student publications and things like that.

07:37.144 --> 07:40.308
A lot of them were just, you know, they came back from the war.

07:40.728 --> 07:43.692
They had the GI Bill and they had a wife and a baby.

07:44.515 --> 07:50.562
and they wanted to get their education, so they came in and went to school year round and, you know.

07:50.842 --> 07:51.803
And they were serious students.

07:51.823 --> 07:55.827
They were serious students and they were trying to make up for the lost years of the war.

07:56.528 --> 08:06.499
And it put a lot of pressure on the freshmen, you know, high school core freshmen because you'd have these guys in the class and, you know, they'd break the curve.

08:06.579 --> 08:13.206
You didn't have a chance with those guys in there because they were all, almost all of them, doing very well and they were very serious about it.

08:13.304 --> 08:15.387
Did they treat you guys like you were little kids?

08:15.928 --> 08:18.653
Actually, they really treated us with respect.

08:18.693 --> 08:24.322
We had no problems with the veterans.

08:24.443 --> 08:26.526
College View, I'm assuming, was packed.

08:27.107 --> 08:28.189
Everything was packed.

08:28.369 --> 08:33.017
In fact, they had a trailer park down over where the,

08:33.689 --> 08:47.248
Well, the farmer students and the foundation, somewhere in their area they had a trailer park and they also had some converted barracks over there which they tore down, you know, in the 70s I guess is when they tore those down.

08:47.588 --> 08:55.579
But they had a trailer park in there and people in, these guys were, wherever they could find a room, Bryan College Station or

08:55.930 --> 08:57.395
They were lucky they were out here.

08:57.436 --> 09:05.586
Of course, a lot of them were bachelors, so they lived in the dormitories, and we had a number of veteran outfits in the Corps.

09:06.022 --> 09:11.588
These guys came back and, you know, they wanted to get their, a lot of them wanted to get their commission.

09:11.629 --> 09:17.055
They'd seen what it was to be an enlisted man, so they figured if they were going to go to the next war, they'd go as an officer.

09:17.716 --> 09:17.956
All right.

09:18.096 --> 09:25.705
At the end of your freshman year, you said you had, did you say you flunked one course your freshman year?

09:25.725 --> 09:25.825
Yeah.

09:25.845 --> 09:26.185
Yeah.

09:26.205 --> 09:26.426
All right.

09:27.427 --> 09:30.190
And, but you were not thinking about,

09:30.676 --> 09:34.019
going transferring, you go off on your Navy cruise.

09:34.860 --> 09:37.402
How was being a sophomore better than being a freshman?

09:38.403 --> 09:44.928
Well, it was just a lot better because you didn't have near as much pressure on you and you were more or less your own boss.

09:46.750 --> 09:50.213
Of course, we had these freshmen for the first semester.

09:50.253 --> 09:51.734
They were freshmen the first semester.

09:51.774 --> 10:00.261
But we didn't come down too hard on those guys because they were older and transfer students and everything.

10:00.832 --> 10:02.875
We were very careful about the way we handled them.

10:05.298 --> 10:07.941
But, you know, sophomore year was a breeze.

10:09.323 --> 10:11.425
You didn't have many freshmen on campus.

10:11.445 --> 10:12.787
No.

10:12.847 --> 10:17.252
And so you didn't have anybody coming and taking care of your room or anything.

10:17.273 --> 10:17.613
Oh, no.

10:17.913 --> 10:18.915
You're still in Spider-D.

10:19.235 --> 10:20.196
Yeah.

10:20.216 --> 10:29.708
No, that year, what happened in 47, they activated or they formed the U.S.

10:29.958 --> 10:30.459
U.S.

10:30.579 --> 10:32.021
Air Force out of the U.S.

10:32.361 --> 10:34.644
Army Air Force.

10:35.225 --> 10:35.966
They formed the U.S.

10:36.146 --> 10:37.248
Air Force.

10:37.268 --> 10:45.118
And so there was an arrangement where 40% of the corps of the cadets would be Air Force, 60% would be Army.

10:45.980 --> 10:58.176
So in this reorganization where they were going to organize a number of Air Force units, they deactivated some Army units and they deactivated C Company,

10:58.561 --> 11:01.416
I mean D Company, D-E-F,

11:02.425 --> 11:04.268
and G Company, I think, infantry.

11:04.749 --> 11:12.080
So I was without an outfit, so I went to C Company, because I had a bunch of friends in C Company, so I went to C Company and stayed there one year.

11:12.140 --> 11:22.897
My junior year, they saw that the thing was not in balance, so they reformed D and E Company, so I went back to D Company my junior year.

11:22.917 --> 11:26.403
And I was the first sergeant my junior year, D Company.

11:26.683 --> 11:29.648
What else was different about being a sophomore?

11:31.636 --> 11:33.139
Well, of course, you got a night out.

11:33.460 --> 11:35.685
That was one of the biggest deals.

11:35.705 --> 11:41.959
You didn't have to be, you still had to make, be in CQ, you know, 730, 1030, but you got one night out.

11:42.300 --> 11:44.144
And you, did you select the night?

11:44.164 --> 11:45.668
You picked the night that you wanted out.

11:45.688 --> 11:48.514
And what did you normally do on that night out?

11:48.798 --> 11:52.542
You know, I don't know, but we got out of the darn somewhere.

11:53.142 --> 11:53.663
Did it mean?

11:53.683 --> 11:55.645
Maybe go to the movie or something like that.

11:55.825 --> 11:58.027
Could you leave the campus if you wanted to?

11:58.188 --> 11:59.289
Yeah, you could leave the campus.

11:59.709 --> 12:13.523
Now at Guyon Hall, is it true that sometimes the members of the Corps would whoop it up during a movie or they would boo or they'd cheer?

12:13.503 --> 12:15.267
Oh yeah.

12:16.189 --> 12:18.333
It's like students anywhere I guess.

12:19.255 --> 12:21.660
What about, how often did you all go to the campus theater?

12:23.604 --> 12:24.927
It depended on what was showing.

12:25.307 --> 12:28.895
If it was something good we'd go, usually we'd go to Guyon Hall.

12:28.955 --> 12:32.322
And then starting my sophomore year, you know when I had free tickets,

12:32.993 --> 12:34.355
Oh, because you were working?

12:34.635 --> 12:36.438
Yeah, I was working student publications.

12:36.458 --> 12:38.040
Oh, so that got you free tickets.

12:38.060 --> 12:40.924
And they had free tickets they would give us.

12:40.944 --> 12:41.004
Oh.

12:41.024 --> 12:50.757
Now, I would go, like on a weekend, I would go down to Bryan and go to the movie down there sometimes, you know.

12:50.777 --> 12:53.280
Now, and this is Aggieland, not Battalion.

12:53.581 --> 12:54.402
that you worked on.

12:55.143 --> 12:57.145
Yeah, the Aggieland, the annual.

12:57.805 --> 12:58.967
But that got you a free ticket.

12:59.047 --> 13:02.370
Yeah, it was the Longhorn and then the Aggieland.

13:02.390 --> 13:03.251
Yeah.

13:04.012 --> 13:11.400
Let's see, any special academic courses that sophomore year that you now realize were important?

13:11.620 --> 13:13.262
Any advisors, any teachers?

13:14.243 --> 13:19.048
You know, I don't, I can visualize some of my profs, but

13:19.501 --> 13:22.606
I never, I can't remember most of them's name.

13:22.886 --> 13:26.532
The ones I remember were Screamin' Al Nelson, you know.

13:26.712 --> 13:27.473
Did you have him?

13:27.654 --> 13:30.899
No, I didn't have him, but he was across the hall and we could hear him.

13:31.019 --> 13:32.982
And you remembered why he was nicknamed Screamin' Al?

13:33.002 --> 13:37.970
Yeah, and then there was Dirty Shirt Nelson, the guy who wore one shirt the entire semester.

13:38.511 --> 13:41.175
Then there was another guy.

13:41.275 --> 13:45.762
You may have to edit this, but he was called Cockstory Clark.

13:46.079 --> 13:51.886
Because if you wrote a sexy story, something about sex, you got a good grade.

13:52.366 --> 13:53.748
Now I had him.

13:53.768 --> 13:55.810
And then there was another guy named Get It Greer.

13:56.771 --> 14:02.638
And he had his spiral notebook, and he read his lectures.

14:02.658 --> 14:04.660
Every once in a while he'd say, Get It.

14:04.680 --> 14:06.803
Well that meant that was a test question.

14:07.063 --> 14:12.289
And it was 50 minutes of listening to him read from this spiral notebook, saying Get It.

14:12.809 --> 14:17.995
And, of course, the story goes that some guy one time said, I got it.

14:18.576 --> 14:20.318
And, of course, he got thrown out of class.

14:21.900 --> 14:23.322
But people like that you remember.

14:23.342 --> 14:28.127
And, of course, Dr. Dan the Grade Point man, you always remember him.

14:28.167 --> 14:29.028
He was a great guy.

14:29.088 --> 14:30.610
Did you have a class from him?

14:30.630 --> 14:31.051
Yeah.

14:31.071 --> 14:31.331
Oh, yeah.

14:31.451 --> 14:33.193
Everybody took Dr. Dan the Grade Point.

14:33.253 --> 14:34.054
What course was it?

14:34.155 --> 14:36.457
It was, we called it sexology.

14:36.497 --> 14:41.263
It was rural sociology, family something.

14:41.564 --> 14:44.087
But did you learn in that course?

14:44.427 --> 14:46.269
Yeah, I thought it was a good course, yeah.

14:46.289 --> 14:50.935
Got an A. Yeah, and it was legendary that he made high grades.

14:50.955 --> 14:52.677
Yeah, Dr. Dan, the grade point man.

14:52.737 --> 14:56.942
Did he become a kind of a friend?

14:57.963 --> 14:58.584
Actually, no.

15:00.426 --> 15:01.327
Can't say that he did.

15:01.907 --> 15:02.728
Everybody liked him.

15:02.748 --> 15:05.091
You know, he was a very likable fellow.

15:05.425 --> 15:08.171
And I had some, you know, ag-eco profs that I liked.

15:08.372 --> 15:12.682
I remember one fellow was kind of heavyset and bald-headed, but I don't remember what his name was.

15:12.762 --> 15:14.687
Who did you go to for academic advice?

15:14.707 --> 15:18.215
Hmm, I don't know.

15:18.235 --> 15:19.218
What do I take now?

15:19.278 --> 15:21.122
Should I do this or do that or?

15:22.351 --> 15:32.083
Well, we had, you could get some help down at the, in the Ag building at the dean's office or, I had to go see the dean in order to change majors.

15:32.163 --> 15:36.709
I remember that Shepard, Dean Shepard, had to go see him, but I can't remember about.

15:37.370 --> 15:37.970
Because R.C.

15:38.091 --> 15:39.613
Potts wasn't the dean yet, was he?

15:39.793 --> 15:40.033
No.

15:40.974 --> 15:43.497
And did you ever have a class with O.D.

15:43.537 --> 15:44.038
Butler?

15:45.082 --> 15:53.100
I think I may have had him for an animal husbandry, but I can't, I really can't remember.

15:53.741 --> 15:55.064
And didn't have time.

15:55.084 --> 15:59.053
I know I had Whiteley, Eli Whiteley for agronomy, I think.

16:00.937 --> 16:02.601
Now, let's see, he was a national,

16:02.918 --> 16:04.921
He was a, wasn't he a Congressional Medal winner?

16:04.941 --> 16:06.363
He was a Medal of Honor winner, yeah.

16:06.584 --> 16:09.148
Did, were you students aware of that thing?

16:09.208 --> 16:09.649
Oh, yeah.

16:09.789 --> 16:10.129
Were you?

16:10.149 --> 16:11.411
Yeah, he was a hero, you know.

16:11.952 --> 16:15.378
Describe him as you remember him as a person.

16:16.800 --> 16:19.164
Well, I remember he was, he was tall and thin.

16:19.184 --> 16:23.290
Of course, this was right after the war, and he'd been, been pretty seriously injured.

16:23.310 --> 16:27.677
He'd probably been in the hospital a long time, but I remember he was just tall and thin.

16:27.927 --> 16:38.681
And it might have been, I don't know if it was agronomy lab or just a regular agronomy class, but we had him and we were, you know, really in awe of this guy because he was a Medal of Honor winner.

16:38.741 --> 16:40.624
How did you all learn he was a Medal of Honor?

16:40.644 --> 16:41.605
He didn't tell you, did he?

16:41.765 --> 16:42.066
Oh, no.

16:43.507 --> 16:44.949
Oh, that's one of those things that you just know.

16:45.130 --> 16:46.872
Because wasn't he very modest about it?

16:46.892 --> 16:48.113
Yes, yeah, I think so, yeah.

16:48.133 --> 16:49.736
That's what I thought.

16:51.217 --> 16:52.399
Let's see.

16:53.088 --> 16:56.493
Any celebrity visitors that you remember coming to the campus?

16:56.513 --> 16:59.417
Well, we had Spike.

16:59.437 --> 17:00.418
Spike.

17:00.558 --> 17:01.039
Jones.

17:01.139 --> 17:04.664
Spike Jones came one time at the town hall.

17:05.024 --> 17:09.811
And we had big dances at Cebisa.

17:10.852 --> 17:12.054
And, you know, that was a big deal.

17:12.174 --> 17:14.718
And we had, I remember Vaughn Monroe was there.

17:15.098 --> 17:17.381
And Tex.

17:17.862 --> 17:18.323
Benneke.

17:18.443 --> 17:19.264
Benneke.

17:20.155 --> 17:24.302
And there were some big name bands that came through there.

17:24.603 --> 17:28.310
I mean, that's Sabisa Hall, that thing would be packed with people.

17:28.330 --> 17:30.113
Did you normally have a date for those things?

17:30.293 --> 17:33.118
I'd normally just go up and bird dog.

17:33.599 --> 17:35.002
Is that what Joe called it?

17:35.022 --> 17:36.284
Yeah, cut in on people.

17:36.464 --> 17:39.750
And how were the girls treated at those dances?

17:39.730 --> 17:42.614
you know, like ladies, very nice.

17:42.734 --> 17:46.840
And they'd bring them down from TSCW and they'd put them in our dormitory.

17:46.860 --> 17:48.583
We'd have to evacuate the dormitory.

17:48.983 --> 17:50.806
They would stay in our room in the dormitory.

17:51.427 --> 17:55.172
And of course the big deal was you left notes for them, you know, hoping that they'd write you.

17:55.273 --> 18:06.389
But I never did have, I may have had a date or two while I was a freshman from a girl to Brian.

18:07.230 --> 18:09.433
And I think I may have had a date or two

18:09.700 --> 18:15.908
during my sophomore year, but I never did have girls come down and see me or anything until my senior year.

18:16.989 --> 18:20.233
And, but that was, you know, that was a lot of fun.

18:20.273 --> 18:28.083
Those big dances, you'd go over and cut in on people, and especially you'd get a sophomore and had his girlfriend there, and you'd go cut in on him.

18:28.123 --> 18:32.889
And, you know, there wasn't anything he could say until later, you know, he'd let you know about it.

18:34.331 --> 18:39.117
Now, did people ever go outside and drink some alcohol?

18:39.805 --> 18:43.455
It was done at times.

18:43.916 --> 18:44.518
But rather rare?

18:44.578 --> 18:48.188
There wasn't much alcohol.

18:48.208 --> 18:51.216
You know, you couldn't have liquor on campus.

18:52.917 --> 18:59.803
I went on that Navy cruise I was telling you about, and I brought back a little old bottle of rum from Cuba.

19:00.324 --> 19:01.244
I think it was from Cuba.

19:01.905 --> 19:04.307
And I had it in my footlocker, which I always kept locked.

19:04.928 --> 19:08.230
I was scared to death that whole year that I had that bottle of rum in there.

19:08.250 --> 19:08.991
I wasn't drinking it.

19:09.051 --> 19:09.431
I just had it.

19:09.752 --> 19:14.616
I don't know why I kept it other than I'd brought it back from, you know, Caribbean.

19:15.957 --> 19:21.422
But there was really no drinking on campus except my freshman year.

19:22.634 --> 19:46.296
first semester we'd have beer bust in the dorm and they'd go out and bring in a keg of beer and we'd have it there in the dorm and everything and of course it was pretty bad because a lot of you know most of the freshmen were 17 and they'd get a pitcher and they were trying to you know they knew they were going to get drunk so they got drunk you know and they'd fall and they'd get sick and you know it was terrible going in there they'd just take them and

19:46.630 --> 19:50.355
throw them in the shower and turn the water on, you know, they'd be sick and everything.

19:50.375 --> 19:52.658
If officially y'all had gotten caught.

19:52.839 --> 19:54.341
Been in trouble, been in trouble.

19:54.481 --> 19:57.705
Could anybody, would it have been unusual to be suspended for?

19:58.507 --> 20:01.771
I would imagine the company commander or someone would have been in trouble.

20:01.791 --> 20:04.455
But anyway, we never, I never heard of anybody getting caught.

20:05.316 --> 20:06.878
And I think it was just tolerated.

20:06.918 --> 20:10.984
I think that they probably would rather you do it in the dorm.

20:11.352 --> 20:12.814
And that's the way when I was commandant.

20:13.015 --> 20:16.982
I'd rather them drink in the dorm than out here driving around.

20:17.523 --> 20:20.087
But anyway, we did have some big beer busts there.

20:21.990 --> 20:32.388
And as far as going, I know, I'm not even sure I did it my freshman year, but I know later on, you know, we'd go out to Ed's, which was still out on Weldon Road, go out there and have a beer.

20:32.668 --> 20:33.630
How far down?

20:34.808 --> 20:36.491
was Uncle Ed's.

20:36.571 --> 20:38.073
It wasn't as far as 2818 is.

20:38.093 --> 20:39.515
Oh, no, no, no.

20:39.575 --> 20:42.139
There was an athletic complex they built out there.

20:42.219 --> 20:45.704
I don't know if you know where that is, which would be on Holloman.

20:46.506 --> 20:49.871
It was between the campus and Holloman and right in there somewhere.

20:50.672 --> 20:53.737
And beer was legal there.

20:54.598 --> 20:55.660
Is that right, at Uncle Ed's?

20:55.680 --> 20:57.322
Yeah, yes.

20:57.342 --> 20:59.125
But no, nothing stronger.

20:59.766 --> 21:01.288
No, not what I know we're doing.

21:01.538 --> 21:07.307
Was the, as far as you recall, did they check to be sure that you were at a legal age?

21:07.347 --> 21:09.930
Never checked, never checked in my life.

21:11.072 --> 21:12.654
And it was only beer.

21:13.736 --> 21:27.276
I know my sophomore year, a good friend of mine, Bob Gregg, who was one of my good close buddies my sophomore year, we used to hitchhike out to the, I forgot what they call it, where 21,

21:28.538 --> 21:33.386
I think they called it the circle, where 21 intersected Highway 6.

21:33.426 --> 21:39.596
And there was the Oasis, I think, and there was Nova Sad or Nova somebody, he was a football player.

21:40.137 --> 21:42.160
There were two or three beer joints there.

21:42.501 --> 21:49.753
And we would go out there on Saturday night and sit there and drink a couple beers and sometime there would be somebody around to dance with.

21:50.324 --> 21:58.637
And, you know, usually we just went out there and drank a couple of beers, and we'd hitchhike out, and then we'd hitchhike back, and that was our Saturday night.

21:58.938 --> 22:10.136
Now, there was no... But we were, I think, I think you had to be 18 in those days to drink a beer, but that's... I haven't had anybody mention any bootlegger in Brazos County.

22:10.777 --> 22:12.880
Well, if there was, I don't know anyone.

22:12.920 --> 22:16.686
Nobody, and... There were people coming around,

22:17.122 --> 22:18.724
football bets, I remember that.

22:20.086 --> 22:24.051
That would come and the guy would sit out in the car and he'd send his runner in and take football.

22:24.071 --> 22:25.693
I never did that on that.

22:25.713 --> 22:29.879
And Whiskey Bridge, people did drive to Whiskey Bridge to buy hard liquor.

22:29.959 --> 22:30.840
Yeah, that's right.

22:30.880 --> 22:32.642
You could get it there.

22:33.023 --> 22:35.526
Did you ever go to the clay pits to go swimming?

22:36.507 --> 22:42.555
Well, we went to the clay pits to use the board.

22:42.974 --> 22:48.102
That's where they did it when I was a freshman.

22:48.262 --> 22:48.743
Okay.

22:49.303 --> 22:50.105
Second semester.

22:50.345 --> 22:54.010
When they'd crack down, they'd go out to the clay pits.

22:54.030 --> 22:56.494
And I remember that's where they beat our handle off.

22:57.916 --> 23:02.723
But now sometimes didn't a group go out there and skinny dip and drink some beer?

23:02.843 --> 23:03.665
I'm sure they did.

23:03.685 --> 23:09.994
I don't know that I ever did.

23:10.649 --> 23:13.934
I'd really like to know where the clay pits are located.

23:14.075 --> 23:17.080
Nobody that I've talked to can really remember.

23:17.240 --> 23:17.681
I don't know.

23:17.701 --> 23:19.283
It's just out that way somewhere.

23:19.403 --> 23:21.727
That's what most of them say.

23:22.929 --> 23:23.370
Let's see.

23:24.772 --> 23:27.817
YMCA, were you involved in any YMCA activities?

23:28.138 --> 23:30.422
No.

23:30.602 --> 23:32.625
MSC, of course, wasn't here yet then.

23:32.645 --> 23:33.867
No, we didn't have anything like that.

23:33.887 --> 23:34.969
Did you go to the Quack Shack?

23:36.097 --> 23:38.780
The college hospital?

23:38.961 --> 23:43.767
Well, I think I probably went over there, but I can't, you know, I can't remember.

23:43.807 --> 23:45.889
If I did, it was just for a cold or something.

23:45.909 --> 23:47.952
So you didn't get my Asperg, you know.

23:48.292 --> 23:50.635
You didn't break a wrist or anything?

23:50.675 --> 23:57.004
No, I was never injured, and I don't know that I was ever really sick when I was here other than colds.

23:57.024 --> 23:58.185
Oh, let's see, two people.

23:58.265 --> 24:00.568
Do you remember Mr. Cashin?

24:01.595 --> 24:02.596
Red's dad.

24:03.156 --> 24:08.762
See, he's the one that created the Y. What about Colonel Andy?

24:09.322 --> 24:10.924
Yeah, yeah, he was a track coach.

24:10.944 --> 24:11.665
Describe him.

24:11.905 --> 24:14.527
Well, he's a little, I don't know, a little shark guy.

24:15.488 --> 24:16.509
What kind of personality?

24:17.670 --> 24:25.718
Well, kind of a cocky type as far as I remember, but I don't remember much about it because I didn't, you know, I didn't go out for track or anything.

24:25.958 --> 24:26.719
Pleasant?

24:27.280 --> 24:27.740
I don't know.

24:28.020 --> 24:28.281
I don't know.

24:28.301 --> 24:29.762
I remember Marty Corot was the,

24:30.451 --> 24:32.053
I think he was a baseball coach.

24:32.073 --> 24:35.676
Of course, there was Homer Norton was a football coach.

24:35.756 --> 24:39.179
Then I think Harry Steitler came in after Homer Norton.

24:41.161 --> 24:44.865
You know, those were just guys you'd see the distance and you didn't, you know.

24:44.965 --> 24:47.427
What did you and your buddies think about the athletes?

24:47.627 --> 24:48.528
How were they treated?

24:48.688 --> 24:49.229
Were they, did they get?

24:49.249 --> 24:51.051
Well, a lot of them were in the Corps.

24:51.071 --> 24:52.953
Did they really participate in the Corps?

24:53.073 --> 24:53.813
Yeah, yeah.

24:53.833 --> 24:57.657
Some were, you know, I know there's one guy who was a company commander

24:58.092 --> 25:03.565
As far as y'all knew, were they given automatic passing grades?

25:03.585 --> 25:05.690
No.

25:06.832 --> 25:07.253
Let's see.

25:07.514 --> 25:15.713
Were there celebrity students during your days, famous students?

25:17.498 --> 25:19.460
No one that I knew was famous.

25:19.480 --> 25:23.063
There was no All-America football player then.

25:23.083 --> 25:26.126
There was no Dick Todd or John Kimbrough.

25:26.186 --> 25:35.195
They had been early, and there was none, and nobody who was hugely wealthy.

25:35.655 --> 25:39.859
Describe, in general, your four years, describe the Indian student body.

25:40.080 --> 25:41.101
What kind of boys were they?

25:41.781 --> 25:43.863
Well, mostly rural.

25:44.844 --> 25:46.746
They were from smaller towns.

25:47.840 --> 25:52.106
and I'd say middle class.

25:52.908 --> 25:54.750
What kind of values did they use?

25:54.770 --> 26:01.480
Well, I think they had the values of the Depression years.

26:03.183 --> 26:04.264
Hard-working?

26:04.525 --> 26:11.675
Hard-working and honest and straight shooting, you know.

26:12.036 --> 26:14.580
If somebody told you something, that was usually the way it was.

26:14.620 --> 26:16.783
You didn't have too many con artists.

26:17.270 --> 26:18.832
Did it matter where you came from?

26:18.852 --> 26:21.936
It didn't matter where you came from or what you did.

26:22.537 --> 26:24.920
It's the same way in the core of the day.

26:25.181 --> 26:29.787
They don't care where you're from or how much money your father has or any of that.

26:29.887 --> 26:31.129
What did matter?

26:31.149 --> 26:34.633
Well, how you performed, how you acted.

26:35.234 --> 26:40.722
Do you remember, were there some Catholic and Jewish and Protestant boys?

26:40.742 --> 26:42.003
Oh, yeah.

26:42.684 --> 26:43.225
All kinds.

26:43.245 --> 26:45.488
In fact, one of my good friends, I didn't know for

26:46.649 --> 26:49.272
probably three years that he was Jewish.

26:49.732 --> 26:53.436
His last name was Clark, and that didn't sound like Goldstein or anything.

26:53.476 --> 26:57.821
I didn't know that until I looked in the annual one time and saw he was a member of the Hillel Club.

26:58.522 --> 27:00.264
Were there Hispanics?

27:00.364 --> 27:11.616
Yeah, there were a few, not too many, but I had some good friends that were Hispanic, and they were treated just like anyone else and respected.

27:11.876 --> 27:15.120
I know we had a couple of them from Laredo,

27:15.657 --> 27:18.817
that were in my class that were good friends?

27:18.897 --> 27:21.735
There were almost no international students, though.

27:22.728 --> 27:24.911
Not many, not many.

27:25.572 --> 27:34.946
They were, now like I said before, we had, when I was in my sophomore year, we had a couple of cadets that were from Guatemala that were in the Corps.

27:37.389 --> 27:40.433
I'm not sure there were any other international students in that group.

27:40.514 --> 27:43.157
I can't think of any, but we had a few foreign students.

27:43.418 --> 27:47.824
I know that we heard the story that

27:47.804 --> 27:57.516
that the housing put a Pakistani and a Hindu in the same room, and the Pakistani spent the night sharpening his knife, and they had to separate them the next day.

27:58.738 --> 28:00.661
So, you know, they both had turbans, I think.

28:00.701 --> 28:02.783
The housing, they had turbans of turbans, so.

28:03.945 --> 28:06.188
But that was a story going around about that time.

28:06.228 --> 28:08.150
That's about the time they got their independence.

28:11.114 --> 28:15.820
You mentioned, a while ago we mentioned Silver Taps.

28:16.306 --> 28:21.033
What else was serious at A&M?

28:21.073 --> 28:21.834
Silver Taps?

28:24.959 --> 28:28.304
Do you remember going to Muster as a student?

28:28.324 --> 28:29.205
Well, yeah.

28:29.225 --> 28:30.267
Muster, we had that.

28:30.387 --> 28:39.440
The one I can recall was down on the steps of the administration building.

28:39.480 --> 28:40.542
We had the Muster there.

28:41.045 --> 28:45.992
And I'm sure I went all four years, but that's, we may have had several there.

28:46.993 --> 28:48.915
But those, that's the muster I recall.

28:49.036 --> 28:51.459
And that was, you know, that was a serious tradition.

28:52.340 --> 28:54.102
Silver Tafts is a serious tradition.

28:55.584 --> 29:02.193
A lot of things that, you know, I didn't think were too serious, but people call them traditions.

29:02.834 --> 29:06.338
Now, the MSC was not finished when you left, was it?

29:06.358 --> 29:09.803
They were building the MSC when, when,

29:10.154 --> 29:13.798
I had my final review in 1950.

29:14.058 --> 29:20.744
I guess it was 1950.

29:20.764 --> 29:23.567
And were there any religious activities on campus?

29:23.627 --> 29:24.909
Were there religious clubs?

29:25.189 --> 29:30.054
Yeah, there was the Hillel Club for the Jewish students.

29:30.094 --> 29:34.658
There was the Newman Club for the Catholics.

29:36.280 --> 29:38.642
And, of course, there was the Baptist Student Union.

29:40.343 --> 29:41.605
I don't know what else they had.

29:43.067 --> 29:45.230
And Renaissance Week, was it held then?

29:46.131 --> 29:48.334
I think it was, yeah.

29:48.374 --> 29:50.738
Where the ministers would come and be here a week or something?

29:50.758 --> 29:52.901
Yeah, I hadn't thought about that in a long time, but I think we had that.

29:56.145 --> 29:57.367
Who was the commandant then?

29:58.108 --> 30:00.932
My first two years was Gaius Malloy.

30:02.414 --> 30:03.055
M-U-L?

30:03.556 --> 30:04.577
M-E-L-O-Y.

30:04.978 --> 30:05.619
M-E-L-O-Y.

30:05.639 --> 30:06.760
Malloy, yeah.

30:07.061 --> 30:07.161
Okay.

30:07.580 --> 30:09.664
Describe him.

30:10.305 --> 30:11.888
Oh, he was a super soldier.

30:11.908 --> 30:18.642
He had been a regimental commander, decorated in World War II, and then he went to Korea.

30:18.782 --> 30:23.812
He was the regimental commander of one of the regiments, 2nd Infantry Division, I think.

30:23.832 --> 30:25.776
One of the Distinguished Service Cross was wounded.

30:26.938 --> 30:29.503
And then, last time I saw him, he was the

30:30.142 --> 30:32.684
commander of the 8th Army and U.S.

30:32.725 --> 30:33.746
force, or U.N.

30:33.786 --> 30:34.807
forces in Korea.

30:34.827 --> 30:37.549
He came down to speak to us one time.

30:38.310 --> 30:46.398
I think we had a muster, I think is what it was, and he came, he was our muster speaker when I was about 63 when I was in Korea.

30:47.679 --> 30:55.907
And he was there the first two years, and the second two years was Hayden L. Boatner, the boat.

30:56.287 --> 30:57.068
Yeah, describe him.

30:57.248 --> 30:58.950
Okay, he was a little cocky.

30:59.993 --> 31:05.338
loud, aggressive officer.

31:05.959 --> 31:08.862
He had been a BG in World War II.

31:08.942 --> 31:24.097
He was with Stilwell in Burma and then he was, like so many, he was reduced back to colonel after World War II and he came here as a full colonel and boy, he was really tough.

31:24.137 --> 31:29.562
He could stand out there on that parade ground and you could hear him all the way across the parade ground and I know one time

31:30.082 --> 31:35.755
I had to go in because one of my sophomore, when I was a company commander, one of my sophomores had been caught
