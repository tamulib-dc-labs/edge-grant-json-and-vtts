WEBVTT

00:02.258 --> 00:06.103
He knew that Mr. Stark and others like him had a 
certain following. And there were some very

00:06.143 --> 00:15.315
prominent people like John Lindsay and others 
that knew that that was important. And I think put

00:16.657 --> 00:20.742
up with it. He really didn't think it was 
necessary. A lot of student life. But he changed

00:24.507 --> 00:26.069
some on that later. Now, when I became aware of the 
hierarchy, Wayne Hall was the Vice President of

00:32.768 --> 00:36.894
Academic Affairs. Had Mr. Rutter selected him, or 
do you remember? I don't. I don't either. What was

00:41.842 --> 00:43.244
their relationship? It was pretty good. Wayne 
was, as you know, dedicated, quiet,

00:47.411 --> 01:01.392
didn't waste a lot of words, and generally made the 
right decisions. I don't recall any animosity

01:01.861 --> 01:05.765
there.

01:09.048 --> 01:18.057
What was the guy's name that

01:09.048 --> 01:18.057
came in as the, what did they call him? He was an 
engineer by nature, and he ended up back at

01:18.077 --> 01:22.902
University of Houston. Oh, Lordy, what's his 
name? He was going to be the research whiz. Yeah.

01:32.924 --> 01:33.726
Oh, boy. Well, his

01:33.746 --> 01:42.797
method of operation was very, very unlike what Mr. 
Rutter. I'll think of his name, too, in a minute. He

01:47.603 --> 01:50.667
didn't use good judgment on many of his decisions. 
I agree to that. He had the faculty upset. He had

01:53.511 --> 01:55.273
everybody upset. On the surface, he was kind of an 
agreeable type of guy, but when it would come to a

01:56.536 --> 02:06.028
decision, he'd come out with some outlandish 
things. Well, I remember one day at a faculty

02:06.048 --> 02:19.506
meeting of arts and sciences, he told us that the 
way to measure the importance of the research that

02:06.048 --> 02:19.506
anybody did was how much money did it bring in. And 
somebody then asked, you mean if we're doing

02:20.077 --> 02:26.906
research that doesn't get any outside funding 
that it's worthless? And he said, that's right.

02:28.469 --> 02:31.573
And of course, those of us in history were turned 
off.

02:34.777 --> 02:41.607
Did Mr. Rutter have anybody that he turned to for 
advice? Tell me what you think of this. Where he

02:45.963 --> 02:47.485
would frankly, candidly? A lot of those were 
former students. OK. That he would call, yes. Who

02:53.231 --> 02:54.433
would be the most likely? H.B. Zachary would be 
one.

03:01.120 --> 03:08.329
Hal Booty,

03:01.120 --> 03:08.329
John Lindsay.

03:11.953 --> 03:13.454
Doc Daugherty, Evans. Just a minute.

03:25.957 --> 03:31.203
Harold Dunn.

03:31.223 --> 03:32.986
He thought a lot of the Maltz boys. Krueger, Polly 
Krueger. Polly Krueger.

03:47.984 --> 03:52.249
I don't know how well he knew Joe Aaron Moore. Joe 
Moore was then, I think, less active as a former

03:56.990 --> 04:02.398
student than he became. He would call up board 
members too and get their advice on things.

04:12.912 --> 04:15.997
Tom Cherry he leaned on real heavily again.

04:19.542 --> 04:20.223
Not Hannigan.

04:25.650 --> 04:26.912
I was trying to think of He talked a lot with Hervey 
and Warris. He probably paid more attention to

04:35.293 --> 04:47.689
former students than any president, but followed 
closely by Jack Williams once he got to know them.

04:48.450 --> 04:51.815
Then they were called board of directors, not 
regents. Did the directors bother him much with

04:51.835 --> 04:55.199
phone calls, letters? No. It was a remarkable 
thing, and you and I have talked before. Those were

05:03.206 --> 05:05.869
the days, and I went to their meetings. I didn't 
stay for the closed sessions where they would talk

05:07.592 --> 05:16.003
about personnel matters and things like 
coeducation and what have you. But he listened

05:16.023 --> 05:22.532
very closely to Sterling Evans, had the highest 
regard for him. And it scared him too because

05:23.390 --> 05:29.939
Sterling was the one that said, boys, we're not 
going to get by here much longer without girls. The

05:30.760 --> 05:33.164
other thing is our library is a joke. And that 
brings to mind a picture of you and I together on the

05:35.147 --> 05:45.281
top of the library at the topping out ceremony, 
which is the central part of the library now. And

05:45.301 --> 05:45.681
Mr. Rudder looked at me with a tear in his eye up 
there on that roof and said, Edmund, this is all the

05:45.741 --> 05:53.312
library will ever need.

05:57.072 --> 06:01.198
That's good. But I would put Sterling Evans way, 
way up high. Another one on anything to do with the

06:05.484 --> 06:12.754
press, communications, public relations, Sam 
Wittenberg. Sam wouldn't show up for the

06:13.636 --> 06:20.225
meetings, but he would call, and he kept in close 
touch. And overall, with people like... Boydle

06:26.215 --> 06:41.910
and Simons, as you and I talked about the other day, 
and Evans, their attitude was these were smart men

06:26.215 --> 06:41.910
that knew what to get involved in and what, as the 
book says, to keep their cotton-picking fingers

06:26.215 --> 06:41.910
out of. They would want to hear why we were moving in 
a certain direction and the reasons behind it. And

06:47.955 --> 06:52.500
once they believed it, they were stolidly behind. 
But the president made the decision, not the

06:52.540 --> 06:55.142
board. Can you remember any specific example of 
where a board member attempted to get involved or

06:55.645 --> 07:11.122
where was turned around in his ideas? I think, and 
here again, boy, this is real personal, but the

07:12.043 --> 07:22.834
most troublesome board member I recall was LF 
Peterson. He thought that we should beat

07:23.219 --> 07:27.983
everybody in football by a minimum of 40 points. He 
would call and ask why certain plays had been

07:29.765 --> 07:38.914
called, and to please get the coach to understand 
not to do that again. And I remember he would say

07:39.755 --> 07:45.720
things like, I'd be sitting there when the calls 
would come. And every president's rule is, if a

07:45.760 --> 07:50.004
regent calls, put him on. I don't care who's in the 
office. And Mr. Peterson, bless his heart, I love

07:54.269 --> 07:58.515
the guy. He was just a big overgrown boy. 
Everybody's exuberant. He said, Earl, I'm

08:04.503 --> 08:12.154
sending you five custom-made silk shirts from my 
tailor in Japan, and they'll be there Thursday.

08:12.194 --> 08:14.257
Now, that's what I've done for you today. Now, let 
me tell you what you're going to do for me. And he

08:18.383 --> 08:22.048
would have some kind of a little, pet project that 
he wanted. But somewhere along in there, things

08:25.756 --> 08:37.110
began to change in terms of the relationship 
between the president and the chancellor, always

08:25.756 --> 08:37.110
a thorny thing, and the regents. And I have seen it 
go from a well oiled machine with people that were

08:38.572 --> 08:45.300
at the top of their field, their professions. And 
as you say, this was not the highlight of their

08:46.121 --> 08:50.787
career being on our board. But they used their 
expertise and their knowledge and their

08:51.290 --> 08:59.540
smoothness to make it a well-functioning 
operation. Not that they agreed on everything

09:00.021 --> 09:03.945
with the president, but you couldn't tell it. But 
now, in more recent years, I see people that are in

09:04.967 --> 09:17.642
there for their own magnificence and spotlight 
and more of the political thing. Here's what...

09:19.049 --> 09:23.914
I'll go along with, but here's what I want from you, 
support for this and that. And it looks like a

09:23.954 --> 09:34.243
committee, like a camel to me, a committee that was 
gone crazy. When you first joined the staff, the

09:34.844 --> 09:42.752
board quarters were in that old Victorian house 
north of Sbisa. That Mrs. Cashion was the house

09:43.072 --> 09:45.014
mother. She was the house mother. Red Cashion's 
mom. Right, right. And they would come there and

09:47.787 --> 09:54.078
where were the meetings held? There was a big room 
up on the second floor. The official meetings were

09:57.384 --> 09:58.586
held there? And some of the board members were 
housed there and some elsewhere. It was kind of a

10:04.316 --> 10:12.630
rank, RHIP, and the higher ranking ones, most 
tenure and what have you, would be there and the

10:04.316 --> 10:12.630
others would be I guess even the Aggieland Inn, 
which was right across the street there, way back

10:13.538 --> 10:20.528
there, or at the Student Center. But Ms. Cashin 
ran, the visitors would come in and she would sit

10:21.108 --> 10:36.590
there with them if they were going to be on the 
program, or they could go upstairs and sit against

10:21.108 --> 10:36.590
the wall and wait for somebody to come out and call 
them in. And there was no open meeting then. Not per

10:40.724 --> 10:41.866
se. But the average visitor couldn't walk in? No, 
no. That's what I thought. They'd be called in for

10:46.572 --> 10:48.094
their business. Mr. Rudder said, now, these old 
boys are doing this for nothing. They're giving us

10:54.844 --> 10:58.128
our time, and we need to be real nice. And so I'm 
going to start a new program. Cooper, you're in

10:59.891 --> 11:00.892
charge. We have the meats laboratory, the dairy 
laboratory, and I'm going to tell them what we've

11:01.773 --> 11:09.364
got out there, and when they come in, You give them a 
little paper. I worked out that system where they

11:11.848 --> 11:16.675
could, here's what you could order. It was mainly 
wheels of cheese and any kind of meat product. What

11:24.106 --> 11:24.947
was their favorite? The

11:25.968 --> 11:33.399
wheels of cheese always sold out. And the dairy 
people, Mr. Parrot, I remember, was his name.

11:38.234 --> 11:44.540
finally learned that he damn sure better hold back 
when he'd see a board meeting coming up instead of

11:38.234 --> 11:44.540
selling it. But they'd buy backstrap off the 
cattle. What do you call it? What's the fillet?

11:55.189 --> 11:55.810
Backstrap. And Mr. Peterson would want every 
wheel of cheese that was available. And it seemed

12:01.735 --> 12:05.659
like Sterling Evans would buy 15 or 20 back straps. 
They used them for entertainment, and said, this

12:08.921 --> 12:13.307
is Aggie, the best we have, and so forth. Now, they 
paid for it. Oh, yeah, they paid for it. Yeah, they

12:16.231 --> 12:18.374
paid for it, but they got good prices. But my job was 
to gather that up as they left and make sure they...

12:18.494 --> 12:24.983
Walford Kane was a sweet old man. He was on the 
board, and I'll never forget a funny, sad thing

12:25.043 --> 12:32.473
that a student driver... slammed the station 
wagon door on Mr. King's fingers.

12:43.343 --> 12:47.549
And instead of screaming, he just kept saying, get 
the door open. He says, it's closed on my fingers.

12:52.075 --> 13:00.908
At any rate, you'd go all the way from what was fun to 
see the personalities as reflected in what they

12:52.075 --> 13:00.908
wanted, what they would buy. And Mr. Clyde 
Thompson from Dybal, which he was not one of our

13:01.411 --> 13:06.777
real heavyweights on the board. And I'm sure he was 
part of the old timber syndicate over there. And

13:12.164 --> 13:17.911
all these other guys would be ordering full 
tenderloins and what have you. And they'd say,

13:17.931 --> 13:22.656
Edwin, you reckon out at the poultry farm they've 
got eggs? I said, yes, sir, they've got eggs. He

13:24.078 --> 13:26.121
said, you reckon they've got them big old brown 
ones? I said, yes. I said, how many do you want? He

13:28.664 --> 13:30.726
says, a dozen. But to see someone like Evans 
contrast with some of the weak sisters that were

13:30.875 --> 13:44.352
political expedience was really funny. And I 
always remember everybody called him Doc Boydle.

13:51.681 --> 13:56.667
Never could be seen at a meeting without his hand 
computer. Everything that was said, he would

13:57.347 --> 13:59.430
double check it Check the mathematics of it. The 
mathematics of it. And I think Mr. Evans through

14:05.262 --> 14:27.232
all the years

14:05.262 --> 14:27.232
probably did the best job of manipulating 
President Rutter of any of them to the tune that the

14:05.262 --> 14:27.232
library really was inadequate and that we would 
never really reach our potential without girls.

14:28.373 --> 14:28.894
And I think Gracefully, he was able to show Mr. 
Rudder the reality, because though he never

14:32.106 --> 14:45.986
looked me in the eye, I am convinced that Earl 
Rudder really wanted a very fine West Point type

14:32.106 --> 14:45.986
activity here in College Station. But he finally 
realized that wasn't going to fly. And then the

14:50.312 --> 14:59.185
most memorable thing he ever told me was, I don't 
remember whether it was just on one trip, but He

14:59.502 --> 15:10.352
stayed at the White House when Mr. Johnson was 
there, right at that time, mid-60s, when all the

14:59.502 --> 15:10.352
big decisions were about to be made. And he told me 
that he went to Lyndon Johnson and said, I'm not as

15:12.114 --> 15:27.788
good on timing as I should be, but coeducation, 
integration, blacks, name change, to the

15:28.696 --> 15:36.385
university, and non-compulsory core, the big 
four. And over whiskey, he said to Lyndon Johnson,

15:36.405 --> 15:47.458
primarily the coeducation thing, I think, was he 
said, what do you think about it? And the way he said

15:48.319 --> 15:58.551
it to me was, he said, Earl, you can do it your way now 
or our way later, and you're going to like your way a

15:48.319 --> 15:58.551
lot better than you're going to like ours. I'm glad 
to hear it. Now, when he came back, he'd made up his

16:00.628 --> 16:07.656
mind then that the change had to take place. But he 
wanted even then to do it very gradually. And

16:11.340 --> 16:12.882
that's the way it worked right at first. Mr. Heaton 
was petrified to put it in the catalog and did not

16:13.883 --> 16:18.208
for three years. But he

16:20.430 --> 16:29.500
came back and the board told him when they were 
ready to make these big decisions The board said,

16:30.239 --> 16:43.233
and I hope I'm right on this, and I think I am, said, 
Earl, get in with those alumni, and we want them to

16:30.239 --> 16:43.233
support us in advance of this decision. And John 
Lindsay was president. And he went to some of the

16:47.478 --> 16:59.892
biggest squabblers about it and said, now look, 
now you keep your damn mouth shut, but I had the

16:47.478 --> 16:59.892
president of America tell me that it has to be done 
If we want to do it our way, we can do that. Now, we

17:03.382 --> 17:05.645
need you, and you're the one that's squabbling. 
Now, the main trouble was in Dallas and Beaumont.

17:10.271 --> 17:18.020
And there was a certain amount of diploma burning, 
and not much, not near as much as people laid on,

17:10.271 --> 17:18.020
senior ranks and that. But when he came back with 
that story and said, look, what alternatives do we

17:18.241 --> 17:25.650
have? He said, in effect, this is not what I want 
necessarily. But it's what's going to happen.

17:31.187 --> 17:33.189
Now, this was after you were working for him. And 
then, let me finish that story. I think it was this

17:36.492 --> 17:41.236
same trip where you ask him that, of these 
questions. And he let him know what kind of a tight

17:42.738 --> 17:46.261
situation he was in. And just as a side note, 
something really big in international policy

17:46.321 --> 17:59.933
came up, and Lyndon was called away from his usual 
goodnight drink with whoever his guests were He

18:01.128 --> 18:02.310
said, just stand by. He said, we'll get this damn 
thing solved one way or another. We're going to

18:05.996 --> 18:07.318
have some whiskey tonight. And it went on and on and 
on, and Mr. Rudder got bored. He could not sit

18:11.165 --> 18:12.327
still. Could not. And he picked up a newspaper 
there in the White House, and at a theater not four

18:14.831 --> 18:22.745
blocks away was a theater on the roof, and he'd been 
wanting to see that. So he got all of the...

18:27.031 --> 18:30.075
protocol of leaving the White House grounds. He 
had all that worked out and his passes and

18:30.115 --> 18:33.138
everything. He went to the picture show and saw 
Fiddler on the Roof and at five, about five in the

18:33.479 --> 18:45.993
morning, he said that phone by his bed rang and it 
says, Earl Rudder, you son of a bitch, he said. The

18:47.315 --> 18:52.701
President of the United States of America wants to 
drink whiskey with you and you go out and see

18:47.315 --> 18:52.701
Fiddler on the Roof. The SS people knew exactly 
where he went. Oh, yeah. Oh, sure, sure. And

18:57.783 --> 18:58.944
reported back to him. And that was the funny part. 
But I think that was the trip where he did that

19:02.267 --> 19:06.792
several times. But they were really, sure enough, 
close. I mean, as close as you can get. And I

19:13.117 --> 19:18.902
remember, I think you were already working for 
him. There was going to be a referendum of students

19:19.903 --> 19:23.987
on these questions. But there wasn't going to be a 
faculty referendum. And we were really

19:28.641 --> 19:31.025
frustrated. The day before that referendum, by 
luck, there was a regular fall meeting of all arts

19:31.466 --> 19:43.565
and sciences faculty, or fall or spring, over in 
the chemistry lecture hall. And Mr. Rutter spoke.

19:46.350 --> 19:52.219
And in his speech, he didn't say a thing about those 
key questions. And so as there were question and

19:53.330 --> 19:56.113
answer, nobody touched it. And finally, they 
said, we've got time for one more question. I

19:59.437 --> 20:00.378
raised my hand. And I was scared so that my voice 
quivered as I asked, why didn't you ask the faculty

20:01.640 --> 20:11.611
for their vote on this? And Mr. Rutter said, hell, I 
didn't need to ask you all. I know you're all for

20:14.514 --> 20:16.937
those changes. And everybody kind of cheered. And 
seven years later, when I was in his office begging

20:19.165 --> 20:28.121
for money for the library, I mentioned that to him, 
if he remembered that question. And he said, yes,

20:28.302 --> 20:30.706
and I remember how scared you were. So I give him 
excellent marks for that. Are there any other

20:36.918 --> 20:50.101
people that you can think of who deserve mention as 
being key

20:36.918 --> 20:50.101
co-education, non-compulsory, co-racial 
integration? Well, John Lindsay, I would say...

20:53.748 --> 20:55.531
He was former student president during that. 
Right, and I was at the meeting in the...

21:04.441 --> 21:08.846
What did they call the big meeting room right at the 
end of the hall on the second floor? The ballroom

21:08.906 --> 21:10.929
was there, but the... Birch room. I guess. Down at 
the east end of the second floor? Yes. That was a

21:16.375 --> 21:17.957
birch room. Everybody was on pins and needles 
because they knew this was coming up. This is the

21:21.602 --> 21:22.923
former student board? It was their winter board 
meeting. Oh, yes. And I was there. Summarize it.

21:27.929 --> 21:32.895
And John Lindsay was as pale as that paper. because 
there'd been a lot of hard talk about this, and that

21:33.837 --> 21:55.667
the school was going to hell, and that the alumni 
were not going to, when it came down to it, they were

21:33.837 --> 21:55.667
not going to vote to endorse the board's impending 
decision before it happened. They wanted

21:56.548 --> 21:57.469
support. And so I was there, and I'm telling you, We 
were all on pins and needles. And I guess there had

22:06.787 --> 22:25.814
been a little bit of skullduggery maybe on someone 
to make the motion and someone to second the motion

22:06.787 --> 22:25.814
that they support coeducation at Texas A&M 
University, support the board's impending

22:06.787 --> 22:25.814
decision to do that. And Lindsey made the, the 
preliminary remarks and then said, do I hear a

22:32.107 --> 22:36.333
motion? And someone immediately snapped up. And 
there was an immediate second. And there was an

22:41.480 --> 22:45.285
immediate all in favor and all opposed. There was 
not a whisper of opposition. And Lindsay slammed

22:49.591 --> 22:56.080
that gavel and was the most got out of there faster 
than a speeding bullet. But it went through.

22:57.201 --> 22:58.042
That's what I had heard. Yeah. And that Wirus and 
Hervey. had helped yeah uh right and that as i

23:02.532 --> 23:29.704
understand that the former student action may 
have helped move another board of directors vote

23:02.532 --> 23:29.704
or two there may have been one or two of those people 
that yeah so do you know of any uh director who

23:02.532 --> 23:29.704
officially opposed any uh opposed the uh Those 
major decisions? I've never heard of anybody who

23:33.548 --> 23:37.312
officially opposed it. No. If there was, it was 
behind closed doors. And he sure said nothing

23:43.158 --> 23:46.841
about it. But I think the key to it all was Rutter's 
strategy, and I knew he knew what Lyndon Johnson

23:47.302 --> 23:56.531
was going to say. But when he came back with the 
President of America saying these things, what

23:56.551 --> 24:00.535
could you do? I've never heard that. You've 
highlighted my day already with that. Tell

24:09.238 --> 24:21.713
me how, as far as you know, how did he start racial 
integration? I've heard that he called the

24:22.013 --> 24:30.724
Pentagon and that when they sent some enlisted men 
that one summer to begin their finish their degree

24:31.210 --> 24:56.914
that some of them were black okay here's what comes 
to mind and i hadn't thought of this a major united

24:31.210 --> 24:56.914
states army was assigned to the rotc the 
commandant's office

24:31.210 --> 24:56.914
and he came down for a preliminary trip

24:31.210 --> 24:56.914
mainly to find housing

24:59.965 --> 25:01.507
somewhere close to the campus. And he was denied by 
everybody. Because he was black? Because he was

25:07.553 --> 25:08.534
black. The nicest, as I remember, a very nice man. 
Today it would be just such a foolish thing, you

25:12.158 --> 25:16.342
wouldn't even, you couldn't believe it happened. 
But now here's what I think happened. Earl Rudder

25:21.227 --> 25:28.875
called one of his local honchos, Jack Connolly, by 
the way, was a big, they were real close, and

25:21.227 --> 25:28.875
Connolly was mayor. But he called John Cecil 
Culpepper Sr. He said, Culpepper, we're going to

25:37.745 --> 25:41.471
find out what you're made out of. You've got all 
these little houses over there, you know, over

25:42.673 --> 25:51.769
there by the, they were kind of new then, by the 
theater, the mud lot, right in there. He said... I

25:55.248 --> 26:04.539
not only want you to find this major a place to live 
in your property, but I want you to get the Real

25:55.248 --> 26:04.539
Estate Association undercover any way you want to 
do it. Let's get rid of this crap. He said, we're

26:06.761 --> 26:10.926
going to have black people in here, and you might as 
well just grow up to it right now. I need your help.

26:11.887 --> 26:12.348
And he did. At the risk of all sorts of ridicule, he 
did it, though. Now, that's my memory of how it

26:18.475 --> 26:20.057
happened. As

26:20.172 --> 26:47.428
I recall, the first black students to enroll was in 
a summer, and that some of them were regular army

26:20.172 --> 26:47.428
enlisted men who had been sent here by the 
Pentagon, and that Mr. Heaton, somebody I

26:20.172 --> 26:47.428
understood, told Mr. Heaton, you get on the phone 
Monday, registration day, and call the

26:20.172 --> 26:47.428
instructors that will have any of them in class, to 
tell them that those students are admitted, they

26:48.708 --> 26:57.976
have been admitted, they're OK. And so when they 
are in your class tomorrow, Tuesday of summer

26:48.708 --> 26:57.976
school, there is no. Just saying that part of it, I 
had no contact with that at all. All right. I think

27:02.881 --> 27:04.783
I'll know the answer to this question. Tell me any 
of the major incidents you recall on the campus of

27:05.764 --> 27:13.150
black students attending class.

27:16.694 --> 27:17.935
I don't remember one. No. There weren't any that I 
know of. When Rutter asked me in 67 to go out and

27:20.930 --> 27:37.351
develop a program for the non-core students when 
we knew we were going to swing that way with girls

27:20.930 --> 27:37.351
and non-military type students, and he asked me to 
do that. I've got something I want to give you on

27:37.451 --> 27:39.874
that. How nice. That's from Abby? Yes, it's from 
Abby. Beautiful. Joyce and Shelly and Sharon Cash

27:47.255 --> 27:54.722
and all got a hold of my girls and said, take care of 
your mother.

27:58.405 --> 28:07.273
When I went over there, there were two civilian 
student activities in 1967 to develop a program

27:58.405 --> 28:07.273
for non-core students. And we call them civilian 
students, because that's what they call

28:07.293 --> 28:10.456
themselves. Very proudly. Very shortly after I 
was on that job and the announcements were made

28:14.686 --> 28:34.953
that I was there to help develop programs for 
non-core students, a pretty down-in-the-mouth

28:14.686 --> 28:34.953
couple of black boys came by and said, we don't 
believe what you all are saying about us being

28:14.686 --> 28:34.953
welcome here. And I said, well, why don't we get 
close together and at least have a chance to

28:44.403 --> 29:13.819
express a view you from the standpoint of the black 
students me from the standpoint of what i think the

28:44.403 --> 29:13.819
administration is saying that's what my job is and 
i formed the first black student advisory

28:44.403 --> 29:13.819
committee and i am telling you haskell monroe that 
our first few meetings were just short of violent

28:44.403 --> 29:13.819
because they truly believed could not believe 
though they'd had no stress could not believe that

29:15.065 --> 29:20.953
the university was serious about integration. 
Now, these were students enrolled, full-time

29:21.775 --> 29:26.121
students. They were not athletes. They were some 
of our first black undergraduate students. But

29:31.128 --> 29:32.710
they anticipated problems. Yes, they did. And if I 
ever read people's faces, I can tell you they did

29:34.112 --> 29:41.022
not trust me at first. And gradually, we were able, 
when I say here is why this is happening, here's

29:42.014 --> 29:50.726
why, they finally began to trust me some. And 
eventually, because of the way things moved

29:50.746 --> 30:02.623
along, I think, in a positive way,

29:50.746 --> 30:02.623
they just quit meeting. I think they were 
satisfied that things were going to get better. In

30:06.549 --> 30:10.755
those years working closely with Mr. Rutter, 
other than coeducation, Voluntary Corps and name

30:11.663 --> 30:15.888
change and so forth. What do you think were his 
other greatest steps of pride, things that

30:15.908 --> 30:23.637
happened that he was most proud of? His 
connections with Teague and Moore and Clayton and

30:25.039 --> 30:37.013
others.

30:38.140 --> 30:46.771
One thing he was tremendously proud of was the 
amount of state and federal funding that he was

30:38.140 --> 30:46.771
able to get for the institution. And he really 
believed in this thing that came about, the study

30:46.792 --> 30:54.922
you were involved with, is we are going for 
excellence to do that. We need a first class

30:55.063 --> 30:59.168
faculty, first class student body. That affects 
admission standards. We need

31:01.671 --> 31:05.937
facilities. He probably did more for

31:07.402 --> 31:18.764
facilities at that time than all the other 
presidents put together. And he had the

31:18.784 --> 31:20.387
connections to do it. Other things that he took 
pride in, through his connections, Teague, for

31:20.908 --> 31:26.980
example.
