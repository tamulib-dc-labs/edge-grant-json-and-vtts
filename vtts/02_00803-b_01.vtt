WEBVTT

00:02.663 --> 00:04.925
He said that you're alienating them? Yeah, he 
said, you people are alienating a lot of whites in

00:05.025 --> 00:09.730
this area. And I asked him why, and he said, well, 
because you're being too pushy to further the

00:10.971 --> 00:23.943
cause of these Hispanics attending college and 
all that. And then when I told him that the majority

00:24.144 --> 00:30.730
of these recipients were Anglos, not Hispanics, 
He was very surprised to know this. He thought that

00:34.177 --> 00:43.313
we existed only for the benefit and the 
enhancement of the Hispanic culture. That's not

00:43.353 --> 00:43.914
so. Then did he donate something? Then he said, I'm 
going to give you a donation out of my pocket. Ten

00:49.984 --> 00:50.505
dollars. He said, well I cannot be present at your

00:51.387 --> 00:57.257
dance. As you know, or you probably don't know, 
because the Black and White Ball Association is an

00:59.650 --> 01:10.842
organization that never has sought publicity. It 
works in a very low key profile. And last year,

01:17.469 --> 01:23.816
their annual dance is held in February. And the 
Bolo Brazos, now defeated, and his candidacy for

01:29.823 --> 01:34.271
re-election was a guest of honor. The year before 
then, Phil Grand was our guest of honor. And both

01:40.743 --> 01:47.695
last year and the year before then, President 
Miller has attended on both occasions.

01:51.061 --> 01:54.447
How many do you usually have turn on at the dance?

01:57.262 --> 02:00.487
in the vicinity of 250, something like that. I 
neglected to tell you the

02:03.110 --> 02:15.488
most productive source of income, and that is the 
Ugly King contest. Oh yeah, I was reading about

02:16.409 --> 02:18.852
that. See, the Black and White Ball Association 
invites certain prominent members of the

02:18.872 --> 02:25.041
community to be candidates for ugly king with the 
idea that the one who collects the most votes will

02:26.135 --> 02:41.812
become king and be crowned king at the dance. Well, 
each vote counts, each vote costs one penny. And

02:49.641 --> 02:55.247
1978, a

02:49.641 --> 02:55.247
local practitioner local physician here by the 
name of Shipman was crowned king. He collected by

03:02.135 --> 03:04.698
himself sixteen hundred dollars. Commissioner 
Cooley who was county commissioner for precinct

03:06.900 --> 03:21.336
one and I and uh and Andy Herrera were all uh 
candidates and uh Andy and his followers

03:22.210 --> 03:49.348
contributed about twelve hundred dollars to his 
campaign and see all of that goes for the payment of

03:22.210 --> 03:49.348
for for the award of scholarship there isn't a 
single penny out of that ugly king contest that is

03:22.210 --> 03:49.348
spent for anything else so you see all told now see 
uh Dr. Shipman collected sixteen hundred and Andy

03:50.088 --> 03:56.759
about $1,200, and Bill Cooley and I brought in 
about seven or eight hundred dollars apiece. And

03:58.141 --> 04:05.773
so that was a very significant sum of money, all of 
which was used for scholarships. I have a

04:05.793 --> 04:06.915
question. it deals with early period of your life 
when when you left and went into the Marine Corps

04:08.566 --> 04:20.282
why did you decide to come back to A&M if you felt you 
were being discriminated against? I think it's

04:20.302 --> 04:21.443
the best school in the country.

04:24.928 --> 04:27.271
There are a lot of other schools that you could have 
gone to. And another thing is I'm a resident of

04:27.351 --> 04:31.217
Texas. It has the only College of Veterinary 
Medicine in it. You know, it made no sense for me to

04:34.520 --> 04:39.748
try and get a degree in veterinary medicine 
outside of my state. So all of the reasons

04:40.890 --> 04:47.340
were very prominent in my decision. How could you 
tell me about your military career? Sure. I was

04:57.035 --> 05:02.063
commissioned in the ROTC here in 1951. And then I 
was called to active duty in 1952, only a few months

05:02.752 --> 05:08.920
after I had graduated.

05:11.604 --> 05:13.206
This is before you went on to California? No. I went 
to California to practice with Dr. Tully there in

05:16.170 --> 05:24.702
North Hollywood, California. I still have my 
California license, as you can see up there. And I

05:30.933 --> 05:35.897
was called to active duty in November of 1952. So 
just a few months after you were out in California?

05:41.743 --> 05:43.684
Yeah, I had just gotten out of school in May. You 
see, I thought that it was a mistake, you know, that

05:45.426 --> 05:53.853
I shouldn't be called because I had already served 
in World War II. And at that time, 1952, they were

05:54.694 --> 06:00.079
calling people for the Korean emergency. who had 
never served before. And I think the top

06:03.541 --> 06:10.932
priorities was, the top priority was the people 
who had been in the A.H.D.P. program, had had their

06:10.952 --> 06:16.460
education paid for, and had never returned Uncle 
Sam the favor. You see? But, I was, I was recalled to

06:20.026 --> 06:25.975
active duty anyway, and I went. And when I reached 
The meat and dairy hygiene school in Chicago, I was

06:28.342 --> 06:32.927
the only veteran in the class. All the rest of them 
were ASTP boys. They'd never seen one day's active

06:36.931 --> 06:39.854
duty, you see. They were all veterinarians, of 
course. We were all veterinarians. Were you

06:43.939 --> 06:46.341
called into the Army or the Marines? No, the Army. 
The Marines never did have any veterinarians. I

06:50.065 --> 06:51.106
was called into the Army. I was commissioned here 
in the Army, and so they said, We need you for this

06:56.118 --> 06:58.401
emergency." And I'm going to tell you my opinion. 
When I got to Chicago, they said, well, we don't

07:04.850 --> 07:12.420
understand here why you should have been called. I 
said, I've been complaining about this for the

07:12.440 --> 07:15.023
last three months. I told them I was a veteran, 
served two years in the Marines, served abroad.

07:20.791 --> 07:25.517
They said, well, this is obviously a mistake 
because none of these other guys is a veteran. But

07:26.932 --> 07:44.430
nonetheless, I went through a meeting there at 
Hygiene School, was assigned to Fort Sam, and I was

07:26.932 --> 07:44.430
so anxious to get out of the Army, to return to my 
practice of veterinary medicine, that the first

07:26.932 --> 07:44.430
day that I became eligible to get out, I did. I got 
out after serving only 15 months. And I went back

07:48.695 --> 07:51.938
into practice, and this time I practiced in El 
Paso. Why didn't you go back to California?

07:57.053 --> 08:03.641
I didn't go back to California because the job that 
I left there had already been filled by somebody

07:57.053 --> 08:03.641
else. I got out in February, which is a very poor 
month, to try and get a job with an older

08:04.562 --> 08:12.132
practitioner. And that same job that I left was 
out. I couldn't return to it. But I began to

08:21.623 --> 08:24.647
correspond with an older gentleman who lived in 
Chino, and he gave me the opportunity to become a

08:25.522 --> 08:31.848
50% partner in California. And I was considering 
very seriously going to work for him, but I was

08:33.650 --> 08:52.508
offered a job in El Paso by a practitioner for whom I 
had worked as a student during my sophomore and

08:33.650 --> 08:52.508
junior years, and during my junior and senior 
year. And he offered me a contract, which I

08:53.197 --> 08:58.545
accepted, and I went to work there instead. Well, 
it turned out that he had set up a probationary

08:59.467 --> 09:04.915
period of six months. And when five months were up, 
I asked him, let's sign the contract, you know. And

09:14.109 --> 09:21.280
he said, well, I've been to my lawyers, and my 
lawyers tell me that I offered you too much in that

09:14.109 --> 09:21.280
original contract. Here is an alternate 
contract." And I said, I don't even want to look at

09:24.274 --> 09:32.968
it, because you and I agreed that you were going to 
give me this contract, and I will accept nothing

09:24.274 --> 09:32.968
else. He said, well, I'm sorry, I can't give you 
that. And I said, well, in that case, I won't. I feel

09:38.877 --> 09:45.468
then that you have broken your word, and I feel no 
moral obligation or commitment to you. And so, Uh,

09:48.142 --> 09:56.113
it was during this interval that I received a call 
from the dean of the College of Veterinary

09:48.142 --> 09:56.113
Medicine here by the name of Armstead. And he said, 
uh, would you like to come and teach here? Really?

10:02.502 --> 10:03.603
Yeah. Had you been corresponding with him? No, no, 
no, but you see I had been an outstanding student

10:05.586 --> 10:08.971
here. He was my teacher. Oh, really? And so he 
called me and said... How did he even know where you

10:11.595 --> 10:14.098
lived? Former student's directory or something? 
No, he knew where I was because we had

10:17.932 --> 10:22.499
corresponded. I never asked him for a job, but out 
of the clear blue sky, I get this call from Armstead

10:22.519 --> 10:30.432
and he said, I've got a job open. I've got an opening 
in the small animal clinic here. Would you

10:35.560 --> 10:39.647
consider an institutional career, an academic 
career? And I told him I'd never considered an

10:40.758 --> 10:43.042
academic career. He said, well, I'll give you a 
week to think about it. I'll pay you more than

10:46.028 --> 10:50.256
you're getting now and give you a chance to work on a 
master's. And before the week was up, I made up my

10:51.198 --> 10:54.745
mind to come to A&M as a teacher. I came here in 1954. 
1954.

11:04.501 --> 11:13.532
And I began to teach here, and in 1957, I got the 
Outstanding Teacher Award from the College of

11:04.501 --> 11:13.532
Veterinary Medicine. I published more papers 
than anybody else in my department did.

11:21.763 --> 11:30.694
I was very happy here, teaching the small animal 
clinic, but during the five years that I stayed

11:21.763 --> 11:30.694
here, I never got a single raise. From 54 to 57? From 
54 to 59. Oh, okay, okay. See? During those five

11:37.293 --> 11:38.315
years. Why not? You answer the question. I don't 
know why not. I mean, what else does a man have to do

11:44.306 --> 11:47.852
to demonstrate his competency? There have been 
people here teaching for 30 years who have never

11:49.314 --> 11:53.762
gotten that award, and I got it in three.

11:56.813 --> 12:00.377
Plus you had a number of publications. I was the one 
that published the most. And in my own department,

12:02.859 --> 12:09.286
see, at that time the small animal clinic and the 
large animal clinic were in the Department of

12:02.859 --> 12:09.286
Veterinary Medicine and Surgery. I was the only 
one in my department who had an advanced degree in

12:10.567 --> 12:14.931
my specialty. I got that degree. You got your 
master's degree. I got a master's degree in

12:18.355 --> 12:25.302
veterinary medicine and surgery when not even the 
head of my department had a master's degree in

12:18.355 --> 12:25.302
veterinary medicine and surgery. There were two 
other people in that department who had master's

12:27.121 --> 12:34.328
degrees, but they were not in veterinary medicine 
and surgery. One of them in microbiology and one in

12:34.348 --> 12:36.390
anatomy. I

12:37.191 --> 12:45.199
didn't know how else I could demonstrate. And you 
never got a raise for five years? I didn't get a

12:49.003 --> 12:50.624
single raise. I was still an instructor at the end 
of five years. The same rank that I had obtained

12:54.627 --> 12:57.650
when I came here. My pay— Did he take this to the 
dean? Oh, yeah. Yeah. What did he say? Well, he

13:04.117 --> 13:11.144
said, if you promise to stay here another year, 
you'll be number one on the list for promotion. And

13:12.385 --> 13:15.568
I thought, well, I wasn't going to stick around 
here. So I made an application. How much were you

13:19.692 --> 13:20.713
being paid? You were going to say that. $6,492. 
That was my total pay. $6,492. That was the highest

13:29.153 --> 13:35.862
pay that I attained at A&M during those five years. 
That's what it was when you started and that's what

13:36.102 --> 13:38.706
it was when you ended. Well, when I started, except 
for the periodic cost of living increase. Oh, so

13:46.737 --> 13:50.182
they gave you a cost of living increase. Yeah. But 
they never gave you a promotion. They never gave me

13:51.744 --> 13:54.908
a promotion or they never gave me any... any 
increase in pay due

13:55.833 --> 14:08.147
to

13:55.833 --> 14:08.147
demonstrated achievements or competence. No 
merit raising? No merit raising. Were other

14:11.632 --> 14:14.154
colleagues of yours getting merit raises? Oh 
yeah, sure.

14:18.339 --> 14:24.827
As a matter of fact, we were hiring people that were 
working for me that were getting more money than I

14:18.339 --> 14:24.827
was. You know, at that time, there were two 
clinicians in the small animal clinic. That was

14:32.129 --> 14:50.256
Dr. Beamer and myself, and we hired a guy from 
Cornell who stayed here only a few months and left,

14:32.129 --> 14:50.256
and then we hired a fellow who was working on a 
master's here, and he was making more money than I.

14:51.097 --> 14:55.303
Then he left, and then we hired Dr. Ellett. who was 
the one that ascended to the directorship of the

14:56.583 --> 15:07.639
Small Animal Clinic after Beamer died and after I 
had left.

15:11.785 --> 15:19.776
But I applied for active duty with the Army on two 
conditions. Oh, in 1959 then? 1959. Okay, so by

15:22.400 --> 15:24.463
1959 you were... Oh yeah, I was discouraged.

15:30.913 --> 15:35.319
And during that interval you had received a 
master's degree from A&M? Yes. Okay, and then in

15:36.320 --> 15:40.986
1959 you decided to apply for active duty in the 
Army again. That's right. Okay, and you tell me

15:41.827 --> 15:43.570
about that. And what were those conditions? Those 
conditions were, number one, that I be sent to the

15:46.554 --> 15:51.801
Armed Forces Institute of Pathology. to be 
trained as a pathologist. And number two, that I be

15:54.807 --> 15:57.670
promoted to captain immediately. I was the first 
lieutenant in the reserves. And those two

16:00.974 --> 16:05.578
conditions were met by the Army. They called me out 
of civilian life

16:06.639 --> 16:20.573
to go fill a job, a job for which I had to compete with 
people who were on active duty. They yanked me out

16:22.223 --> 16:29.773
of civilian life and put me in Washington at the 
Armed Forces Institute of Pathology, and they

16:22.223 --> 16:29.773
began to train me as a pathologist. And they sent me 
to Japan, where I was the chief of the Department of

16:32.216 --> 16:42.309
Veterinary Laboratory Medicine over there. And 
how long were you there in Japan? I was three years.

16:45.553 --> 16:47.015
Both of my kids were born in Japan. There they are.

16:52.008 --> 16:53.911
Then I was sent to Fort Knox. And then from Fort 
Knox, I was sent to Michigan State University to

16:55.813 --> 17:00.200
get my PhD. The Army sent you? The Army sent me. And I 
graduated first in my class. And when was that? In

17:08.211 --> 17:10.955
1968, I got my PhD. Why did they send you for 
advanced training? Because I applied for it. A

17:16.898 --> 17:30.679
circular was sent out to all the veterinary 
detachments and offering this opportunity for

17:16.898 --> 17:30.679
some officer to get a PhD in veterinary pathology. 
That was the first instance in which they had made

17:31.099 --> 17:37.229
this offer in veterinary pathology. So I jumped on 
it and I was a candidate and they considered my

17:37.930 --> 17:44.239
qualification and I was the one selected.

17:46.666 --> 17:48.167
What a great opportunity. You must have froze up 
there. Oh my God, it was cold in Michigan. But my

17:54.213 --> 17:56.736
wife is from there and she was close to her folks. Is 
that where you met your wife? No, you must have met

17:58.458 --> 18:01.100
your wife long before that. No, I met my wife in 
Washington, D.C. I met her while I was attending

18:04.744 --> 18:13.332
the Armed Forces Institute of Pathology as a 
trainee.

18:15.387 --> 18:19.712
I graduated from Michigan State with a PhD in 1968. 
In that same year, I became a board-certified

18:19.792 --> 18:23.557
pathologist, you see. There's only about 400 of us 
in the world. And then following that, I went to

18:27.902 --> 18:43.521
Fort Detrick, where I was chief of pathology 
there, and then chief of pathology at the medical

18:27.902 --> 18:43.521
research laboratory in Fitzsimmons. And in due 
time, I made my regular promotions. And finally,

18:49.563 --> 18:54.070
in 1973, I was promoted to full colonel. At that 
time, the United States Department of

18:56.373 --> 19:11.955
Agriculture sent a request to the Surgeon General 
to have a veterinarian assigned to them to develop

18:56.373 --> 19:11.955
a national plan by which this country could deploy 
military resources to the control of a foreign

19:13.032 --> 19:28.149
animal disease that might have gained 
introduction into this country. And so I worked up

19:30.211 --> 19:35.197
this national plan, and it became an Army 
regulation.

19:37.619 --> 19:40.963
And for this, I was given that award. The USDA gave 
me that award.

20:00.228 --> 20:00.389
Oh, wow. How nice. 1976, and then did you resign 
after that? Well, I retired. Oh, you retired in the

20:07.786 --> 20:08.867
Army? Yeah. So then you had how many years in? At 
that time I was credited with 28 years of military

20:11.630 --> 20:15.615
service. I also was given an A prefix in pathology 
by the Surgeon General, which means that you have

20:18.037 --> 20:28.028
attained the highest competence in your field. 
Really? There's that letter in 1975. and I got the

20:33.222 --> 20:42.314
Legion of Merit and a Certificate of Achievement 
from the Surgeon General for the work that I did in

20:33.222 --> 20:42.314
pathology. Well, after that, why did you ever 
decide to come back here? Well, in 1974,

20:48.122 --> 21:01.660
when I was still on active duty, this university 
was looking for somebody to head up an Institute of

20:48.122 --> 21:01.660
Tropical Veterinary Medicine. which had been 
established in 1966 and supported entirely by

21:04.053 --> 21:23.418
federal funds and whatever contracts

21:04.053 --> 21:23.418
could be generated by this institute. And because 
of my experience in foreign animal disease

21:23.438 --> 21:32.389
control and the fact that I had traveled abroad 
they offered me this job. Dean Shelton offered me a

21:36.063 --> 21:39.106
job. And

21:39.126 --> 22:02.393
I thought that I had always wanted to return to 
Texas, but I wanted to be in pathology in the

21:39.126 --> 22:02.393
specialty which brings me the greatest pleasure, 
and that is the study and control of foreign animal

21:39.126 --> 22:02.393
diseases. And so this was a beautiful opportunity 
to take over this institute, but when I arrived

22:03.942 --> 22:18.603
here and we agreed what the salary would be and all 
that, I was given a partial appointment in this

22:03.942 --> 22:18.603
department here because I am a pathologist. So you 
had a joint appointment then? Yes. One as

22:22.368 --> 22:23.149
director? Director of the institute and a full 
professor of pathology. I see. So I accepted the

22:30.807 --> 22:39.902
job only to find out after I arrived here that there 
was not going to be a nickel support from the state

22:30.807 --> 22:39.902
of Texas. From the directorship? From the support 
of the activities of the Institute. Oh, okay, for

22:46.312 --> 22:47.735
the Institute? Yeah, for the Institute. So that 
had to be funded totally by federal monies? By

22:51.601 --> 22:54.165
federal monies and also whatever contracts we 
were able to generate from pharmaceutical

22:55.276 --> 23:00.624
companies or etc. And that displeased me very 
much. Or grants. Yes. Or, you know, somebody that

23:04.690 --> 23:11.480
might want to make a philanthropic organization 
to, donation to. That displeased me very much and I

23:14.204 --> 23:21.435
began to try and convince the people here that the 
Institute could not possibly exist unless it was

23:22.377 --> 23:29.064
supported by the state of Texas. Because the 
golden age during which the Agency for

23:29.084 --> 23:38.494
International Development was awarding monies 
right and left was over. And so I felt that the core

23:40.616 --> 23:45.661
support should come from the state of Texas. That 
is to say, the payment of salaries to my

23:45.701 --> 23:50.646
professionals, and to my technicians and to 
support the research that we were doing, see. And

23:59.481 --> 24:12.821
wherever I went I hit a stone wall, see, and no one 
supported us with one nickel during thirteen

23:59.481 --> 24:12.821
years that the institute was in existence.

24:12.861 --> 24:17.308
We were able to establish for the university three 
laboratories One in Falcon Heights. It's an

24:20.934 --> 24:24.318
air-conditioned building paid for by federal 
funds. One that is on the third floor of this

24:25.600 --> 24:30.446
building. It's an arthropod tissue culture lab 
that the institute, under my direction,

24:31.347 --> 24:38.657
instituted. And the third one was a 
histopathology laboratory, again without any

24:39.518 --> 24:45.726
state support. installed and still in existence. 
All three of these are going businesses. Well in

24:53.348 --> 25:08.784
1979 my disenchantment was complete and I 
resigned as director of the Institute and the

24:53.348 --> 25:08.784
Institute of Tropical Veterinary Medicine has 
since become defunct. Really? With three labs?

25:12.488 --> 25:12.989
Yes. Now what do those labs do? There has been 
another,

25:15.929 --> 25:32.650
you might say, agency of the College of Veterinary 
Medicine created, which they call the Center for

25:15.929 --> 25:32.650
Tropical Animal Health. It has no director, per 
se. And so they and the Department of Entomology

25:37.056 --> 25:43.624
are jointly using the facilities at Falcon And 
they're using the arthropod tissue culture lab

25:45.494 --> 25:55.247
here out of microbiology, which is supporting the 
salary of the persons who are now running it. And

25:57.170 --> 26:03.799
the histopathology lab is supported by the 
Department of Anatomy and partially by

25:57.170 --> 26:03.799
microbiology. So how many people did you have on 
your staff at the institute? Well... And what type

26:09.006 --> 26:11.610
of research did you do? Our research was devoted 
almost entirely to the control of anaplasmosis

26:15.582 --> 26:43.007
and babesiosis, which are two diseases of cattle, 
one of which is present in the state of Texas, and

26:15.582 --> 26:43.007
the other one is Texas fever, which at one time was a 
scourge of the South, and it's present in Mexico,

26:15.582 --> 26:43.007
it's present in all the Caribbean countries, and 
also in Central and South America, and poses a real

26:15.582 --> 26:43.007
threat I think, of the bovine industries of this 
state. We were trying to develop vaccines against

26:48.987 --> 26:51.450
these two. So our research was oriented entirely 
towards those two diseases because the Institute

26:52.851 --> 27:08.087
does not have a biologically secure area in which 
we can study viral diseases, for example. We don't

27:10.089 --> 27:11.070
have a never did have a biologically secure wing 
that was permitted to expand the scope of her

27:11.692 --> 27:20.402
research. But in this resignation, there was an 
implicit understanding that I would join this

27:21.743 --> 27:36.079
department full-time and assume teaching 
responsibilities that I had not heretofore had

27:36.413 --> 27:45.882
had because of the administrative functions of 
the director.

27:49.305 --> 27:54.049
So I'm now teaching three courses in this 
department. And that's where it's at. Well, tell

27:55.591 --> 27:58.373
me about, let's get back to the Institute for a 
minute. How many staff members did you have? How

27:59.795 --> 28:01.356
big of an operation was this? All right, it was a 
very big operation. During the time that it

28:04.848 --> 28:09.013
existed, it brought to this campus over four and a 
half million dollars.

28:12.456 --> 28:33.319
We had an associate director for research and an 
associate director for international

28:12.456 --> 28:33.319
activities whose function it was to seek out 
sources of money and to write proposals and

28:12.456 --> 28:33.319
compete with other agencies who were after the 
federal dollar. Uh, so to answer your question, at

28:34.953 --> 28:42.382
one time we had about uh, about seven or eight 
veterinarians. Oh yeah. Who were part-time here

28:45.886 --> 28:48.830
and part-time at the Institute? There were, no, 
all of these people, except for two, well three,

28:49.070 --> 28:55.678
including me, were on campus and supported by 
these federal monies. And as a matter of fact, we

29:00.485 --> 29:05.591
paid the salaries of the people that served for the 
Institute in Columbia, South America. There we

29:06.592 --> 29:07.994
had four veterinarians. And then we were

29:09.216 --> 29:17.185
awarded a contract to work in Africa. And the 
people that we deployed out of the Institute was a

29:18.427 --> 29:24.214
veterinarian, a girl who finished in the class of 
76. And with these federal funds, we were paying

29:29.907 --> 29:33.872
these people. That contract alone was over a 
million and a half dollars. As a matter of fact,

29:41.000 --> 29:44.704
that contract is still going on in Mali. That's in 
Mali? In Mali. And it was the Institute of Tropical

29:48.809 --> 29:54.015
Veterinary Medicine in conjunction with the 
Entomology Department who jointly were supposed

29:55.210 --> 30:05.501
to help Mali seek out ways to eradicate the setzi 
fly and trypanosomiasis. Trypanosomiasis being

30:06.182 --> 30:21.639
the most important African disease from a 
standpoint of the number of cattle that it kills

30:06.182 --> 30:21.639
and

30:06.182 --> 30:21.639
from an economic standpoint it is it continues to 
be the number one problem in Africa. Now that

30:23.280 --> 30:24.762
contract is still operating, and the people that 
originally were hired continue to be paid out of

30:25.282 --> 30:35.037
the federal monies. My salary now is paid by the 
Department of Pathology. I have nothing to do

30:39.584 --> 30:47.095
anymore with the Institute of Tropical Veteran 
Medicine, which in the first place does not exist

30:39.584 --> 30:47.095
anymore. And number two, with the foreign animal 
disease programs, I have had to leave that on the

30:55.707 --> 30:56.508
back burner. Well, what about the research in the 
institute and at this university? Is it much more

31:03.677 --> 31:12.168
international in flavor, do you think, over the 
past years, or has it changed in any way since the

31:03.677 --> 31:12.168
50s when you were here, then when you came back? 
Well, uh,

31:13.230 --> 31:19.618
this is only my opinion. Sure, fine. I think that 
the If any criticism were directed against this

31:25.643 --> 31:38.581
College of Animal Medicine for any reason, it 
would have to be in the area of research. I believe

31:38.901 --> 31:49.876
that we have some very competent researchers 
here, but there's just a very few of them that are in

31:38.901 --> 31:49.876
research. And I think that our research 
capabilities could be greatly expanded if the

31:56.187 --> 32:20.794
people of this college of veterinary medicine 
were permitted to and encouraged to develop and

31:56.187 --> 32:20.794
participate in programs of disease research that 
were not necessarily perfectly

31:56.187 --> 32:20.794
aligned with diseases that occurred.
