WEBVTT

00:03.878 --> 00:04.979
You don't have a copy? I don't have a polished copy 
with me, no. Well, I can read this with you if you

00:08.862 --> 00:10.804
wish. Let me come around the other side of the desk 
over there. Do you have a table around here

00:14.087 --> 00:16.429
somewhere? No, I don't have a good table. I'll tell 
you what I can do, though, is move this typewriter

00:18.731 --> 00:22.994
off and wheel this around. Will that work? If I have 
no table, okay. We could go over to the library, I

00:29.680 --> 00:32.162
suppose. That's all right.

00:41.206 --> 00:46.705
Well, your director, you need something like a 
table director. Whatever the archivist's name

00:46.726 --> 00:48.893
is. I'm in charge of moving.

01:15.428 --> 01:18.712
Well, the first is on page seven. Okay.

01:25.859 --> 01:28.622
Here it is. That's misspelled. It's K-U. 
K-U-R-T-H. Is it misspelled consistently

01:33.027 --> 01:35.830
throughout? No, other places it's spelled 
correctly. Okay. I'll leave this list with you in

01:41.015 --> 01:43.478
this copy. So if you can use this and return it to me 
at your convenience. Okay. Now the next is 17.

01:51.076 --> 01:51.617
Okay.

01:57.425 --> 01:58.507
Okay.

02:01.991 --> 02:03.494
I think that's redundant. Perhaps. Scholarly 
intellectuals. Yeah. I think so. Okay. Okay.

02:13.883 --> 02:22.600
Which culminated in amassing?

02:23.782 --> 02:30.475
The Shelter Belt Project or the New Deal. Some of 
the other stuff is obvious, but...

02:41.508 --> 02:52.965
Of course, I don't know where you got that 
information that those early paintings

02:41.508 --> 02:52.965
contributed to the establishment of the Shelter 
Building.

02:52.985 --> 02:56.169
It mostly was the thoughts of Emmons on that. This 
particular guy I was looking at, he thought that

02:56.229 --> 03:09.068
there was, oh, a growing, almost a philosophy.

03:10.027 --> 03:23.903
tree planting on the Great Plains, and these 
various experiments and attempts, and it kind of

03:10.027 --> 03:23.903
snowballed and grew into the Shelter Belt Project 
when the New Deal was looking around for things to

03:10.027 --> 03:23.903
do. Well, to give you some background on that, the 
person who really put this idea across to, maybe

03:24.624 --> 03:36.878
not Roosevelt, but whoever was running the 
program was a man by the name of Rafael Zon, Z-O-N,

03:37.583 --> 03:52.239
who was at that time director of Lake States Forest 
Experiment Station and was a native Russian. And

03:53.240 --> 03:55.682
they had done some of this work in Russia. So I just 
wonder whether you're giving, you're

03:58.145 --> 04:06.814
exaggerating the importance of this individual. 
However, all this, you might be laying yourself

04:07.081 --> 04:19.558
open to some sniping if you left it just that way. 
But you can make a note, if you wish, about how zone

04:20.199 --> 04:34.759
tied into this idea, rather than, in other words, I 
think you're attributing too much of what was done

04:35.448 --> 04:42.917
in the early period here in Texas, and the ideas 
about planning on the Great Plains.

04:46.281 --> 04:46.642
I don't know. I think I could back that up because of 
the writings that I have of those men.

04:53.750 --> 04:56.153
Jones was not particularly interested in the 
book. No, you interrupt a moment. OK. Can you tie

04:57.495 --> 05:02.181
that into the Shelterville book? It's a 
continuation of an idea. of these plantings on the

05:04.540 --> 05:06.683
Great Plains. It was a continuation of this. They 
were warped into thinking that they could control

05:08.686 --> 05:14.716
climate with these plants. Of course, they 
couldn't. They might modify some wind on a

05:15.777 --> 05:19.143
particular area, but they couldn't. But they 
believed they could. Well, it's well

05:22.267 --> 05:32.944
demonstrated that the shelter belts will control 
wind velocity and

05:33.481 --> 05:34.322
When erosion. Yeah, sure. There's no question 
about that. But these men, from reading their

05:37.186 --> 05:41.552
writings at the time, they really thought they 
could make it rain. Yeah, I got that. I question

05:44.496 --> 05:46.879
that. All I'm doing is, the interpretation I got 
out of that is that this had culminated in the

05:47.360 --> 05:58.435
creation of a shelter. I question. Okay. Let's go 
on. You can make your own decision. Okay, fine.

06:03.672 --> 06:04.393
Next is 20. All righty, sir. Well, let me check. Oh. 
Yeah. Let's see.

06:26.246 --> 06:26.927
Uh... I think a better word would be there to say 
that nearly, it's not awkward, but I don't convey

06:27.312 --> 06:38.985
my idea, unnavigable. I know what you're saying.

06:49.558 --> 06:50.599
Okay. Next page is 26.

07:06.732 --> 07:09.977
Why not just say made a survey? Use one word instead 
of two words here.

07:30.003 --> 07:56.124
Well,

07:30.003 --> 07:56.124
let's

07:30.003 --> 07:56.124
see what they don't have in mind there.

07:56.144 --> 07:57.546
Oh yes, yes. Jones believed that the forestry 
practices he had observed in Germany to the area

07:58.066 --> 08:09.324
were applicable.

08:11.368 --> 08:13.511
There's a word left out or something.

08:16.536 --> 08:23.247
I can check that on the master, which is really my 
rough draft.

08:32.086 --> 08:35.070
I see you're finding stuff that even Henry and the 
people didn't find. Well, I don't think you read

08:35.650 --> 08:38.454
about that. No, they probably didn't. Okay.

08:51.670 --> 08:55.054
I have a hang-up on this, so forgive me if I say it. Go 
ahead. And that is that I think this word

08:56.036 --> 08:59.680
professional these days is overused even as 
applied to foresters.

09:07.095 --> 09:12.000
But I prefer the word graduate rather than 
professional. Either a forester is a graduate

09:13.541 --> 09:22.651
forester or he isn't.

09:22.671 --> 09:26.815
And if you want to use professional, it's up to you. 
Talk about a professional plumber and a

09:28.128 --> 09:32.274
professional this and that. Academically 
trained? Well, why not just use Forrester? Okay.

09:42.469 --> 09:50.621
Concept

09:42.469 --> 09:50.621
of

09:42.469 --> 09:50.621
graduate. Okay. Okay. Now on page 62.

10:01.557 --> 10:03.219
I say threatening to what?

10:08.385 --> 10:20.239
Threatening

10:08.385 --> 10:20.239
to the…

10:08.385 --> 10:20.239
To the lumbermen. To the lumbermen? Yeah, that's 
what I was saying in a way. In a way fire protection

10:24.905 --> 10:27.328
was really The issue of fire protection was of no 
threat to them, whereas an issue of required

10:27.815 --> 10:35.744
reforestation would have been a threat. Well, you 
know what you mean. Yeah, I know, but you don't and

10:38.146 --> 10:40.469
the reader doesn't. No, that's right. 
Threatening to what, or in what way? In other

10:45.615 --> 10:51.421
words, it needs a little rewarding, reshuffling.

10:52.903 --> 10:53.684
Yep, you're right. Page 131.

10:56.975 --> 11:25.564
Now,

10:56.975 --> 11:25.564
on that, somehow, maybe I'm misguided in this, 
it's my opinion, but when you refer to a

10:56.975 --> 11:25.564
legislative body, as the legislature, I wonder 
whether it shouldn't be treated as a proper noun. I

11:31.616 --> 11:32.176
don't know. We had some argument on that, and what 
we did is find it both ways in the literature. Oh?

11:38.244 --> 11:38.725
Yeah. Okay. And it depends upon what time you look 
at the literature. You get, you know, at certain

11:42.370 --> 11:45.934
points of time, they do it all one way, and then they 
change. Right now, using any kind of style manual

11:45.974 --> 11:53.043
gets you so confused because of the changes that 
are going on in the language. People are not

11:53.084 --> 11:55.787
capitalizing things they used to capitalize. But 
an editor would certainly force it one way or

11:56.172 --> 12:02.901
another forever.

12:15.237 --> 12:25.791
Well, what I have in mind there is it's either 
forest land or it's agricultural land.

12:26.530 --> 12:36.079
maybe instead of using valuable there, a better 
word would be productive. In other words, it's

12:36.099 --> 12:47.209
more productive for timber economically than it 
is for agricultural purposes, crop purposes.

12:47.229 --> 12:49.832
Productive forest land, marginal farm land. 
Yeah. It could be highly productive forest land

12:53.648 --> 12:59.113
would still be marginally useful for crops. Yeah. 
Of course, from what I can read of what's grown in

13:01.235 --> 13:11.165
East Texas, much of that land over there is not good 
for a whole lot except trees. Right. It's marginal

13:12.266 --> 13:15.969
or sub-marginal for cropping. Except for what, 
some truck crops will grow fairly well if

13:17.611 --> 13:22.896
intensely handled? Well, here again, we get into 
this matter of soil characteristics. And in a few

13:29.683 --> 13:46.407
isolated areas within the Piney Woods area, there 
are soils that can be productive for specific

13:29.683 --> 13:46.407
crops. Taking the belt as a broad area, it's 
marginal at best. I would have thought so. So

13:57.028 --> 13:58.850
that's the intent there. Now that's what, 103? 
106.

14:15.345 --> 14:18.829
The use of the word cost there seems to me a bit 
awkward.

14:21.391 --> 14:23.393
Wouldn't it be better to say Finance?

14:30.522 --> 14:32.464
There's something wrong with that. It's not just a 
word. It's something that's either... I'm trying

14:34.506 --> 14:36.489
to think what it might be. Well, I'll turn this... 
It's an awkward... That's not supposed to be

14:40.193 --> 14:42.676
there. No? No, because I don't... That's not my 
word. I would not have said cost of movement to

14:46.220 --> 14:48.503
Forrester.

14:51.773 --> 14:54.976
I'll just have to check it on the manuscript and see 
if there's a typo and there's something. I can't

14:55.097 --> 14:56.518
figure out what that might be. Okay. Okay. 108. 
108.

15:06.909 --> 15:07.450
Okay. Lumberlands Association of Texas.

15:11.894 --> 15:15.058
Isn't it, is that the correct name? It was at that 
time. It was? Lumberman's Association of Texas?

15:18.180 --> 15:21.584
At least that's what it's referred to in the 
documents I have. My impression was that the name

15:21.844 --> 15:27.130
of the organization, it's a retailer's outfit. 
Yeah. But that's a point. I don't think you

15:30.014 --> 15:35.300
mentioned in there that this is essentially a 
retailer's organization.

15:38.083 --> 15:39.225
I think I did later. Oh. But it might not hurt to, if I 
did before,

15:48.676 --> 15:51.599
And it's not a manufacturer's association.

15:58.725 --> 16:00.327
Okay. 111.

16:11.637 --> 16:17.923
There again we get into this matter of proper 
names. It is not capitalized as yet because the

16:18.595 --> 16:25.262
office doesn't exist at this point. That was the 
ruling I got on this earlier, that we're talking

16:25.282 --> 16:33.491
about something in the future and not an 
established office. Now, when it becomes state

16:33.552 --> 16:37.856
forestry, it has to... Why not do it this way, then? 
The office will create the position of...

16:48.582 --> 16:51.906
State Forest Administrator or something like 
that. That way you can get away from this

16:52.346 --> 16:59.675
controversy where it should be uppercase or 
lowercase. Okay. In other words, a potential

17:01.057 --> 17:02.819
title. What I normally would do if this went to a 
publisher is that at least they have an editorial

17:02.879 --> 17:09.486
staff that knows for sure how they're going to do 
the book. Okay. All right. Well, let's see, 116.

17:19.801 --> 17:20.962
The prize. 123.

17:44.545 --> 17:49.470
What

17:44.545 --> 17:49.470
service committee? That's what it's called. 
That's their title that's on the books itself and

17:54.265 --> 17:59.790
in the description of the papers. Service 
Committee is what it is, it's a meeting the

18:01.251 --> 18:04.854
department is. Oh. That they had at one time. I'm 
not sure that the Forest Service still does it or

18:09.358 --> 18:19.947
not, but they got together at regular intervals, 
very similar to your meetings, and they sat down

18:09.358 --> 18:19.947
and talked about what was and what wasn't.

18:24.247 --> 18:43.168
Well,

18:24.247 --> 18:43.168
I suppose at one time it may have been known as the 
Forest Service Committee, made up of Forest

18:24.247 --> 18:43.168
Service department heads, and then shortened to 
the Service Committee. 146

18:43.188 --> 18:49.815
isn't it?

19:22.921 --> 19:49.189
Unless

19:22.921 --> 19:49.189
you

19:22.921 --> 19:49.189
didn't like this sentence. You already said it. 
OK. 157. There's

19:52.151 --> 20:12.853
an L in there. It's dial, D-I-A-L.

20:12.873 --> 20:19.320
OK. And 192. You

20:22.470 --> 20:45.036
have 192. Oh, I thought you said 182. Oh, I'm sorry. 
There we go.

20:59.851 --> 21:02.513
Oh, yeah, yeah. What I have in mind there, and this 
is where I'll start to point out, if you will look at

21:02.533 --> 21:27.636
the masthead of these newspapers today, it's the 
Dallas Morning News, it's the Houston Post, it's

21:02.533 --> 21:27.636
the Wall Street Journal, etc. I know what you're 
saying. So you'd have to check up on that to see

21:29.213 --> 21:43.716
whether the word Dallas should be underlined too 
or not. Something funny about this because I know

21:44.117 --> 21:46.881
what's happening here. I know how historians get 
around this. As you look at this over time, the mast

21:53.191 --> 21:57.077
changes. It does? From 1950, if you look at a 1915 
paper to today, you get a variation in the way they

21:58.139 --> 22:04.625
did the masthead. Historians get around this by 
going back in the bibliography and saying, Dallas

22:05.607 --> 22:12.894
Morning News, so-and-so to so-and-so, title 
varies. Oh? And that's how they get around it.

22:16.818 --> 22:16.918
Okay. Because it changes from time to time. But 
yes, I know exactly what you're saying. Okay, all

22:20.782 --> 22:22.023
right. That's particularly interesting. Well, 
it depends on what it was at the time. I think To be

22:25.677 --> 22:33.019
perfectly correct, I would have to go to the Dallas 
Morning News for 1920 and be absolutely sure what

22:25.677 --> 22:33.019
their masthead said on that date. Who's going to 
raise the question? I don't know. 223. 223.

23:11.813 --> 23:16.359
I

23:11.813 --> 23:16.359
don't know what I had in mind there. Oh, yes, yes, 
yes. State and federal appropriations. It's a

23:21.225 --> 23:28.714
state appropriation, but

23:21.225 --> 23:28.714
it's a strange thing. It's a technicality in that

23:28.754 --> 23:41.770
the appropriation of the federal government is in 
a block form for a program. And the detail then is

23:47.650 --> 23:56.902
done administratively based on a format. I won't 
go into all the intricacies there, but I assume

23:56.922 --> 24:11.402
that you know that the federal appropriation for 
this particular program went up that year also.

24:14.740 --> 24:17.463
the total appropriation of? For the program, 
state and private program.

24:25.211 --> 24:28.714
But, now you're talking about the total 
appropriation or Texas' share of it? No, I'm not

24:28.734 --> 24:39.525
talking, I'm talking about the appropriation

24:28.734 --> 24:39.525
at the federal level for this particular program. 
Okay. You may have run across that somewhere. You

24:44.214 --> 24:48.239
may have listed it in a tabulation somewhere. No, I 
didn't. I never had listed, except maybe once when

24:49.640 --> 24:56.449
it began, what the total appropriation was for all 
states. Thereafter, I was seemingly more

24:57.430 --> 25:07.984
concerned with Texas, and I only listed Texas's 
appropriation, which may be a weakness of the

24:57.430 --> 25:07.984
paper itself in that it does not give the total 
appropriation. And this thing you talk about of

25:08.538 --> 25:15.007
divvying up the pie may be more important, and I'm 
not sure I should have left that out. It's damn

25:15.027 --> 25:16.068
important. Or used to be. It's not as important now 
anymore. But you don't read much about that. No,

25:21.336 --> 25:22.117
no. And I have a feeling that what I missed, any kind 
of documentation on that at all, of being written

25:22.137 --> 25:31.930
down, I didn't find it in the Forest Service papers 
in Washington. I didn't find any mention of it. No.

25:34.154 --> 25:35.696
of divvying up the pie. If you were to go back to the 
Texas Forest Service and talk to Bess Campbell,

25:35.716 --> 26:03.267
she could probably tell you whether she has in the 
files there

25:35.716 --> 26:03.267
minutes of the meeting of the Association of State 
Foresters, it's now known as the National

25:35.716 --> 26:03.267
Association of State Foresters, in which there 
may be a record of this. But although it's

26:03.803 --> 26:16.858
important, I think, but I don't know whether he'd 
be justified in digging into that aspect of it. If I

26:17.138 --> 26:23.585
could include, was it always done this way ever 
since Clark, well, from Weeks and then to Clark

26:17.138 --> 26:23.585
McNary? Do you have any idea when they did it just 
this way? It seemed like to me when I read from the

26:27.550 --> 26:32.275
original Weeks bill is that somehow the Forest 
Service was instituting a formula and they were

26:33.537 --> 26:42.609
doing it by so much sense per protected area. I 
think that's right. But when the Association of

26:45.113 --> 26:50.140
State Foresters got involved in it, I don't know. 
Well, there's always been, as a matter of fact, for

26:50.881 --> 27:02.076
many years the Association of State Foresters 
wouldn't have existed if it hadn't been to divvy up

27:03.153 --> 27:05.135
the pie. Finally, the U.S. Forest Service got so 
disgusted, I think, all right, you fellas decide

27:06.936 --> 27:15.745
for yourselves how you want to divide it up, and 
we'll do it that way. Rather than to argue with you.

27:19.548 --> 27:19.668
Yeah. Is it a one, is it a formula that they decide 
that it applies to everybody? Oh, yes. In other

27:26.314 --> 27:27.155
words? It's a formula that would apply across the 
board. Okay. But this is a formula that would

27:33.140 --> 27:39.769
apply, and there is always discussion about this. 
Does the office of this organization exist in one

27:39.789 --> 27:45.417
central spot? No.

27:48.582 --> 27:54.710
There have always been minutes of these meetings. 
Yeah, but the chances are that in the Forest

27:54.891 --> 28:01.560
Service here, I will be lucky to even find minutes 
from your period of time. because the files are

28:02.654 --> 28:11.428
purged so frequently over there, unless you had a 
blue sticker on those.

28:11.448 --> 28:12.449
I'd have to talk to Bess. Let me try to remember to 
talk to Bess about this. The reason I was wondering

28:16.676 --> 28:25.590
is if there was a national office or... No, there is 
a national secretary now, but he makes no attempt

28:16.676 --> 28:25.590
to... If he had kept the minutes from the 
beginning, I'd be in business. Yeah. And I could

28:31.083 --> 28:35.468
spend no more than a page simply explaining, this 
is how it was done. Matter of fact, if this seems to

28:35.508 --> 28:40.273
be bragging, it's not. It's merely a mention of the 
fact that Fallowato was the one that instigated

28:40.334 --> 28:52.828
the idea that the association needed somebody to 
represent it in Washington to get its feet in the

28:40.334 --> 28:52.828
trough. So there was nobody before that. No. So 
there probably, until that point, there wouldn't

28:57.932 --> 29:02.357
be any records that existed unless somebody kept 
them. Well, my memory's hazy on that, and I'll have

29:05.061 --> 29:13.230
to check with the best and full agreement. Okay. 
Okay, well that's good, but would you think a page

29:14.732 --> 29:19.557
in there explaining that development If I could do 
it in a page, that would take the bottom room. Well,

29:22.594 --> 29:34.070
it's important in that it contributes to how much 
the total expenditure is going to be made or was

29:22.594 --> 29:34.070
made by the Texas Forest Service for fire control. 
Okay. Now, I found in Washington minutes of a

29:34.751 --> 29:47.850
meeting in the 1920s called the Clark-McNary 
Conference, and evidently they had them almost

29:34.751 --> 29:47.850
every few years. Well, they're held every year, I 
think. And was it possible that this state

29:50.148 --> 29:59.358
foresters organization grew out of those 
meetings of the Clark McNair conference? Could

30:01.821 --> 30:02.322
be. Because that's what they were talking about. 
They talk about that and they talk about other

30:04.364 --> 30:08.308
things, about the law. But I only found one of 
those. That was all that was in the records. Well, I

30:14.235 --> 30:19.581
guess maybe the state foresters used to go to 
Washington on this. It has been reversed for many

30:20.270 --> 30:23.515
years. When I entered the picture, they came to us 
to attend our meetings.

30:32.407 --> 30:43.423
But this matter of giving up the pie was usually 
done by a committee of the organization.

30:43.443 --> 30:46.547
And it was about as equitable, I guess, as you could 
get it. because you had divergent interests. But I

30:49.730 --> 31:00.384
think this point would be worthwhile devoting a 
page to in your dissertation or your book. In the

31:00.404 --> 31:01.465
book, yeah. Yeah, because it's quite important 
because that was a determining factor in what

31:01.485 --> 31:14.222
progress any given state was able to make in 
protecting their forest from fire. Were

31:16.259 --> 31:23.550
there large arguments over this? Heated 
discussion? Oh, sure. Wherever there's money

31:27.696 --> 31:31.141
there's heated discussion. Interesting to 
have... Did they take detailed minutes, do you

31:31.222 --> 31:37.331
recall, at that time? Verbatim? No. Just the 
results. It's nice when you can find those

31:43.919 --> 31:47.924
verbatim minutes because it makes interesting 
stories. 223, 223, 225.

32:03.741 --> 32:07.726
Oh yeah, I have a note here. This is a discussion of 
CCC.

32:14.885 --> 32:39.513
Yes,

32:14.885 --> 32:39.513
this is an idea that I'm not sure, as I remember, 
that you included this, and the essence of it is

32:14.885 --> 32:39.513
that there were two classes of CCC camps, the P 
camps and the F camps.

32:39.533 --> 32:42.276
The F camps

32:44.551 --> 33:06.959
had the camp working on

32:44.551 --> 33:06.959
public land, national forests, national parks, 
and they were not restricted in what type of labor

32:44.551 --> 33:06.959
expenditure was permissible. In pea camps, 
however, the pea camp could Expand its labor only

33:14.858 --> 33:19.865
in connection with fire protection. That's 
right. Yes, sir. Do you have that in there

33:21.127 --> 33:22.429
somewhere? No. I just read it, and I didn't put it in 
here. Oh, okay. I know, but I didn't put it in there.

33:28.297 --> 33:29.819
I think that's... I wrote down here myself a note to 
delineate between the two types of camps. I think

33:34.585 --> 33:35.747
that's desirable. Yeah. Okay. This is another 
area that I would have liked to have written much

33:39.052 --> 33:42.857
more on, but have practically nothing to go on. And 
you know, those camps publish newspapers, too.

33:50.763 --> 33:50.903
Oh? Yeah, I know they did in Texas. They had camp 
newspapers, and none of those exist. Fiddle.

33:57.532 --> 33:57.832
Gone. Yeah. Okay. 227. All right.

34:08.106 --> 34:10.489
Let's see here. Of course, there's...

34:21.127 --> 34:22.631
Oh, yeah. Texas Forest Services. You all right? 
It's confusing.

34:32.820 --> 34:33.081
Okay. 241.

34:54.235 --> 35:04.029
Oh, yeah, I'm suggesting there that there be a new 
paragraph and then, in other words, this is the

34:54.235 --> 35:04.029
first sentence of this paragraph down here. Okay, 
yeah, I think you're right. It wouldn't hurt to

35:06.373 --> 35:07.835
move it down there at all. 243. 243. It's

35:09.337 --> 35:17.909
not Dr. Williams. He doesn't have a PhD? No. That's 
the only place I believe that you used the prefix

35:21.522 --> 35:27.869
doctorate in front of his name. Other places you 
omitted it. 245. Yeah,

35:31.813 --> 35:44.107
well, he's not a, Joe was not a firefighter. He was, 
he was chief of fire control, and that's why I think

35:52.538 --> 35:57.264
that you use... What if I did this?

36:01.068 --> 36:01.849
Referring to that?

36:05.013 --> 36:06.074
Does that explain something? I see. All right. 
It's in the newspaper, people did that. Okay. And

36:12.983 --> 36:16.027
that would, that would, that's what they're 
talking about. If I was a newspaper man trying to

36:16.047 --> 36:18.850
draw the way people, newspaper people write, they 
would call him, oh, he's a chief firefighter, you

36:19.100 --> 36:26.590
know, this is Texas' head firefighter or 
whatever. As if he was always on the scene

36:28.092 --> 36:30.274
directing efforts. I'm not sure he was always on 
the scene directing efforts. Oh, well, there

36:34.019 --> 36:35.781
weren't enough of him. You know, it's like he was 
super smoky to bear. Okay, 246, isn't it? 246, all

36:40.988 --> 36:44.392
right. Yeah, oh, another one. There we go. Check 
that out for sure. 248s? I'll find out he got an

36:49.525 --> 36:52.169
honorary degree somewhere else. I don't think he 
ever did.

37:02.104 --> 37:04.607
He wasn't director, he was associate director. At 
that time he was? Yeah, because Don Lewis hadn't

37:07.512 --> 37:10.336
retired yet. Don Lewis was director of the 
Agricultural Experiment Station. Yeah, he was.

37:17.406 --> 37:18.047
You're right. So he's the associate director.

37:23.992 --> 37:25.934
Okay. It's 248... 256, isn't it? 256. Okay.

37:37.808 --> 37:39.890
Now, he's been taught to go to doctor's degree. 
Patterson?

37:44.916 --> 37:45.016
Yeah. Okay. All right, down here.

37:55.085 --> 38:02.333
That's just one of my prejudices, 
organization-wise, that turned . As far as morale

38:04.094 --> 38:06.357
and organization was concerned? Why don't I just 
say morale was . And I think organizationally is

38:12.403 --> 38:17.488
what you were referring to, wasn't it? Mm-hmm. 
Mm-hmm. Why not use the word organization-wise?

38:22.270 --> 38:37.107
Okay.

38:42.267 --> 38:57.709
I think

38:42.267 --> 38:57.709
what

38:42.267 --> 38:57.709
I had in mind there is that he's up here. Vice 
Chancellor David Dunham was in attendance. Now,

39:02.616 --> 39:07.583
Gib Gilchrist was there for a few minutes at the 
outset. You see, you have him here, but you don't

39:08.103 --> 39:12.189
have him mentioned up here. The committee held its 
first meeting with Vice Chancellor in

39:14.332 --> 39:27.309
attendance, implying that Gilchrist was not in 
attendance, but he was for a while in the left.

39:31.155 --> 39:34.679
I mentioned it because you bring him in down here. 
OK.

39:49.210 --> 39:57.664
Well, again,

39:49.210 --> 39:57.664
I guess it was . . . 275.

40:10.034 --> 40:39.737
The reason I'm asking is that I was in

40:10.034 --> 40:39.737
Madisonville

40:10.034 --> 40:39.737
the other

40:10.034 --> 40:39.737
day And they were looking for Georgia material. 
Well, I think it would be better just to use the word

40:43.869 --> 40:49.677
ownership rather than ownership. All the states 
that had them. I'm surprised Texas didn't have

40:52.081 --> 40:56.306
them. I thought it was all of them. But a large 
number of states that have the 1950s. Land

41:02.996 --> 41:04.077
ownership. 1850s. 1850s. Okay. 284.

41:17.834 --> 41:26.005
Two,

41:17.834 --> 41:26.005
basically and basic.

41:26.685 --> 41:32.913
Why do you need

41:26.685 --> 41:32.913
basically? There's just words. Okay. 287. You say 
you don't have that proof. There's something on

41:41.220 --> 41:43.362
286 also. It's been done at least twice that I know 
about. Yeah. It has been done at least twice. No, I

41:47.666 --> 41:49.127
think about it three times. Well, I don't know why 
we don't have it, because she might have helped her

41:49.828 --> 41:58.015
get this everything up and good.

41:58.836 --> 42:01.658
Oh, I don't know what this was. You told me that this 
is something you want taken out. Yeah, yeah, yeah,

42:05.262 --> 42:08.044
yeah. Right.

42:12.093 --> 42:15.636
That while somewhat true, this connotes more than 
actually there was. Yeah, right. Okay. One could

42:18.399 --> 42:22.483
read something into that, but it's really not 
intended. It's not there. In other words, I don't

42:23.323 --> 42:26.747
remember reading anything. 287.

42:35.314 --> 42:35.414
Okay. He succeeded me. He didn't replace me.

42:42.601 --> 42:45.364
Of course, Dr. Fowler could never be your face. 
That's right. You're right. That is it.

42:50.991 --> 42:51.411
Okay. I already got that.

42:57.819 --> 42:59.321
Turn on your own. I know that's terrible.

43:12.065 --> 43:37.382
In

43:12.065 --> 43:37.382
reading what you have there,

43:12.065 --> 43:37.382
I think there's something lacking in that this 
organization was set up with primarily for the

43:12.065 --> 43:37.382
protection of improved property.

43:37.402 --> 43:39.245
That's something I didn't pick up and didn't know. 
Yeah, that's right. improved property. What is

43:42.859 --> 43:44.421
residences? Oh, I know what you're saying. Yeah, 
you're talking about... It's not just for

43:46.644 --> 43:50.388
protection of wooded land. No, no, no, I know that. 
But it could be. Yes. Yeah, but it could be. It was

43:55.275 --> 43:56.196
used for that. I guess the reason I didn't get into 
it because I'm not sure that the Forest Service

43:58.859 --> 44:03.585
looked at it that way. You know, looking at it in a 
way, perhaps the way I got it for those people over

44:04.466 --> 44:10.894
there in that, yes, it is for small towns, but these 
people can sure help. And they seem to look at...

44:14.422 --> 44:24.393
No, no, it's not, I mean it's not urban or village, 
it's rural improved property.

44:26.895 --> 44:27.836
I will illustrate.

44:30.820 --> 44:38.788
Shortly after I came to the job, there was a crew 
working on a fire And if they failed to get it under

44:40.152 --> 44:50.504
control, it would have burned a residence.

44:52.125 --> 44:57.772
They gave up working on the fire and fell back just 
to protect the residence. And right then, I

44:59.353 --> 45:06.241
fussed, because you're a forest fire 
organization. You aren't a residential property

45:06.281 --> 45:09.805
organization. I think that will clinch what I have 
in mind. Okay. Yeah, I understand what you're

45:15.746 --> 45:17.348
talking about. My problem in this, I think, was not 
knowing exactly the intent of the law. Who did you

45:21.772 --> 45:23.533
talk to over there? Oh, let's see. Who did I talk to? 
I talked to Bruce about some of this. What he was

45:28.438 --> 45:40.028
saying, what I'm saying is it wasn't so much that it 
was not this improved property, but they had hoped

45:28.438 --> 45:40.028
that by stimulating this, they would get help from 
these organizations. In other words, these

45:43.368 --> 45:47.473
people could be a great help to the Texas Forest 
Service. Indirectly, but they couldn't sell it on

45:48.274 --> 45:51.418
that. Essentially, it was a political pull. Oh, 
yeah, most things have a political basis to them.

45:59.748 --> 46:01.370
But that was kind of the impression I got. They 
said, well, sometimes these people in some areas

46:01.390 --> 46:05.655
are fighting more fires than we are.

46:10.421 --> 46:10.521
Yeah. Well, I don't know. That was just kind of the 
impression that I got from it. And I think I got some

46:14.148 --> 46:16.311
of this from Kramer, too. That was his, maybe that 
was his great... You see, I can't speak as

46:16.391 --> 46:28.524
authoritatively as they can because this started 
during Kramer's administration, but I didn't

46:16.391 --> 46:28.524
know. Well, this whole part of the dissertation is 
weak, very weak. It doesn't have the inside

46:33.009 --> 46:38.475
information that I had earlier from the letters 
and documents. I don't have motivations. I don't I

46:41.197 --> 46:44.160
don't have successes and failures. I just don't 
have it.

46:49.104 --> 46:52.367
It's perhaps because the Forest Service has 
become more technical also. In those early years,

46:52.387 --> 46:54.148
they weren't technical. They're technical now. 
They're getting that way. And this part of the

46:57.571 --> 47:02.275
dissertation to me is the one I'd like to redo. It's 
just so weak. I'm not sure it says anything. It's

47:06.699 --> 47:07.920
kind of a glorification. OK.

47:11.453 --> 47:11.974
294. . Okay,

47:12.194 --> 47:21.829
294. .

47:25.114 --> 47:28.019
Who is they? .
