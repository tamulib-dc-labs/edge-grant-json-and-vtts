00:02.731 --> 00:21.840
Bob Cornish, I'm in the office of Roberta 
Burroughs, B-U-R-R-O-U-G-H-S.

00:02.731 --> 00:21.840
Roberta, tell us what your title is and what kind of 
responsibilities you have in the planning

00:02.731 --> 00:21.840
department. I am assistant director for 
redevelopment. My responsibilities include

00:24.363 --> 00:30.713
housing, economic development, neighborhood 
planning, and the Community Development Block

00:31.300 --> 00:33.062
Grant. Okay, that's quite a bit. Yes. How many 
people report to you? Approximately 34.

00:45.719 --> 00:50.625
What is your academic background? I have a degree 
in regional planning, city and regional planning

00:50.645 --> 01:00.278
at the Masses level from Cornell. And I have a 
sociology degree, a bachelor's degree, from

01:00.325 --> 01:08.358
Hampton Institute, now called Hampton 
University. In Washington. It's in Hampton,

01:11.823 --> 01:13.686
Virginia. It's pretty close to Washington. Okay, 
where were you before you came to Houston? At

01:20.597 --> 01:21.338
Cornell. This is your first job right out of 
school. Yes, I was an intern here even. Is that

01:27.588 --> 01:29.269
right? Between my first and second year in 
graduate school, I was an intern here. Well, since

01:35.557 --> 01:40.362
you've been in Houston, you've also become active 
in APA. Could you describe your activities in APA

01:40.542 --> 01:45.528
for us? I have been the local section director 
twice. What were those years? And

01:52.064 --> 02:13.779
I'm

01:52.064 --> 02:13.779
now the membership chairperson for the state 
chapter and looking at running for a national

01:52.064 --> 02:13.779
board seat. I haven't decided which one.

02:18.760 --> 02:20.222
What does your division do? Let me rephrase that. 
How do you find you spend most of your time?

02:29.615 --> 02:46.978
I spend most of my time involved with the Community 
Development Block Grant in one fashion or

02:29.615 --> 02:46.978
another, writing and or reviewing guidelines, 
writing and or reviewing contracts to try to get

02:29.615 --> 02:46.978
the money spent. I spend a lot of time writing, not 
writing, reviewing neighborhood plans. I also

02:54.522 --> 03:01.230
spend a great deal of time with the small business 
loan program, either writing or reviewing

02:54.522 --> 03:01.230
guidelines for it. And

03:03.012 --> 03:08.298
with the rental rehab program.

03:11.241 --> 03:15.126
I understand that the planning department here 
Planning and Development Department now,

03:15.376 --> 03:35.082
inherited quite a few programs that I think in your 
case were the subject of some criminal acts and

03:15.376 --> 03:35.082
unfortunate maneuvers by previous employees and 
whatnot. Would you like to go into some of that for

03:35.142 --> 03:38.887
the record?

03:40.710 --> 03:43.273
The division where the alleged, I guess, I'm not 
sure whether they're alleged. I think people were

03:45.342 --> 03:46.804
actually convicted. I think they were, yeah. That 
division was spun off from the department before I

03:48.005 --> 03:57.198
inherited the community development 
responsibilities. It now resides in the public

03:58.019 --> 04:00.603
works department. So my relationship with them is 
one of coordination. So I really am not all that

04:04.769 --> 04:09.395
familiar with the facts of what happened. It's my 
understanding that shabby rehab work was being

04:12.312 --> 04:16.457
approved in return for bribes. We kind of cleaned 
house and set it up in the Public Works Department

04:18.379 --> 04:34.557
where we feel it's more appropriately housed 
because of their role in handling inspections and

04:35.093 --> 04:38.057
Because of their experience and that kind of 
thing. So that's what's happened with that. You

04:42.965 --> 04:46.630
have three divisions under you. Neighborhood 
planning, CD grant management, and economic

04:47.612 --> 04:54.883
development. Could we talk a little bit about 
economic development, particularly in view of

04:54.983 --> 05:04.577
the depressed economy of Texas and Houston in 
particular? We have several programs that are

05:05.755 --> 05:17.971
designed to stimulate economic redevelopment in 
low-moderate income areas, which is an area that

05:05.755 --> 05:17.971
encompasses roughly a third of the entire city. 
And most of our programs rely upon funding from the

05:20.073 --> 05:25.761
Community Development Block Grant. We have a 
small business revolving on fund program the

05:32.131 --> 05:48.330
small business owners who are doing business, who 
are located in one of our low-moderate income

05:32.131 --> 05:48.330
areas, they can, the way the program is presently 
structured, they can apply, business owners can

05:32.131 --> 05:48.330
apply for a tandem loan, which means we will make 
half the loan. The other half has to come from the

05:48.350 --> 05:50.012
bank. But we are in the process of amending that 
program because we found that banks are really not

05:57.562 --> 06:02.088
very interested right now in loaning money in the 
low-model neighborhoods. So we are amending the

06:02.989 --> 06:10.318
program to allow us to make direct loans to small 
business owners who are located in our areas. And

06:11.400 --> 06:13.863
we can also do facade loans. Where does this money 
come from? That's from the Community Development

06:15.805 --> 06:18.309
Block Grant. That's the source of capital for the 
program. We've set aside a million and a half

06:20.872 --> 06:23.215
dollars. And it will revolve. Payments will 
revolve back. And if we run out, we will reprogram

06:28.163 --> 06:34.653
community development funds to put more money 
into it. Do you charge an interest? Yes, we're

06:36.856 --> 06:39.420
charging 6% interest on those. The tandem loans, 
the interest right now is half a prime. But we're

06:45.309 --> 06:49.416
proposing to change that to 6% so we don't have a 
real mixed portfolio. So it will all be 6%. Well,

06:53.975 --> 06:56.298
that's quite an interesting program. Yeah, I'm 
really excited about that program in particular.

06:59.703 --> 07:06.473
It's something that planners, it's the kind of 
thing planners don't traditionally get a chance

06:59.703 --> 07:06.473
to get involved with. So I'm learning a lot about 
banking and lending and being a bank. We're

07:12.242 --> 07:21.535
learning a lot about being a bank because we also 
service our loans, both housing and small

07:12.242 --> 07:21.535
business and So we're having to learn how to be 
bankers as well as planners. Do you have any staff

07:25.068 --> 07:27.952
members who have had banking experience? Yes. 
That must be a help. The small business person

07:29.614 --> 07:31.096
does, yeah. It was hard to find him, too, because 
our pay scales are not at the bank level. No. And we

07:37.966 --> 07:42.011
searched for many months, and we have someone 
we're really happy with. Well, the climate for

07:43.473 --> 07:51.184
planning seems to have changed with the election 
of Catherine Whitmer, and then with the

07:51.400 --> 08:04.879
appointment of a new planning director. And of 
course the size of the staff has more than doubled,

08:05.760 --> 08:17.256
and I would expect that morale would be 
subsequently raised. with all of these changes

08:17.860 --> 08:25.290
and opportunities that have been made available 
to planners? I think from the standpoint of people

08:26.131 --> 08:40.931
being a lot more able to do the things that they were 
trained to do in planning school, morale is

08:26.131 --> 08:40.931
certainly higher. Of course, you have to take into 
account that everyone's pay was cut 3% last year.

08:46.852 --> 08:56.969
So that's almost counterbalanced to all the 
wonderful changes that are taking place

08:46.852 --> 08:56.969
professionally in the professional arena for 
planters here. But I think that we're able to see, I

08:58.591 --> 09:09.109
know I personally am involved in a lot of things 
that I had never been involved before, and that's

08:58.591 --> 09:09.109
very exciting and challenging. And that's the 
case for most everybody. with the possible

09:13.649 --> 09:20.495
exception of our community development people 
who are more or less doing what they've always

09:13.649 --> 09:20.495
done, but I think doing it a lot better.

09:24.499 --> 09:34.567
The year that Ephraim, in fact, the day that 
Ephraim became planning director, it was

09:24.499 --> 09:34.567
announced that the city budget was going to be cut 
15%. So if your salaries were only cut 3%, I suppose

09:35.588 --> 09:43.335
that the planning department made out quite well 
on a across the board basis. Not really. The

09:47.290 --> 10:09.087
salaries were cut citywide, and the reason it 
impaired morale so greatly is because the idea,

09:47.290 --> 10:09.087
the city council did that over the mayor's 
objection, and the idea was the mayor wanted to lay

09:47.290 --> 10:09.087
off people, and city council did not want them laid 
off, so as an alternative, they cut our pay, but

09:47.290 --> 10:09.087
people were still laid off. So the way that people 
feel city-wide, this isn't just the planning

10:09.758 --> 10:18.866
department that was affected, is it was 
pointless. People, I think, were willing to make

10:19.387 --> 10:26.653
the sacrifice if it meant that their co-workers 
were kept on the payroll. But both things

10:27.334 --> 10:28.595
happened. Pay was cut and people were laid off. 
Except in the planning department, you added. We

10:33.940 --> 10:35.501
did not lay off anybody. In fact, you were hiring, 
weren't you? And we still are. We're in a hiring

10:38.851 --> 10:42.115
mode right now, even. Maybe I should apply. Well, I 
should probably tell you that the previous

10:44.398 --> 10:55.512
personnel director went through and cut all of the 
pay grades for planners, which is a source of

10:44.398 --> 10:55.512
morale among the people whose classification is 
planner. So we had on the one hand something that

10:56.353 --> 11:05.504
really was designed to raise morale,

10:56.353 --> 11:05.504
that had the effect of raising morale. And then on 
the other hand, we had this counter bailing

11:08.247 --> 11:15.234
forces, so somehow the personnel department did 
not get the word that planning was going to be

11:08.247 --> 11:15.234
elevated. Well, maybe between Ephraim and the 
mayor that could be changed. Yeah, we're working

11:19.879 --> 11:21.060
on it. The politics are not right right now to raise 
anybody's pay, but I think it'll happen. Yeah,

11:27.326 --> 11:28.327
probably. It sounds like it might. Yeah, it'll 
happen. It's just too big an inequity and

11:30.049 --> 11:33.933
injustice to not be righted. Sure.

11:38.588 --> 11:47.079
Let me ask you then, would you have much to do with 
the new comprehensive planning process? Yes, by

11:47.099 --> 11:53.468
virtue of the fact that the neighborhood planning 
division is part of this operation. The

11:54.189 --> 12:04.663
neighborhood planners have in fact been working 
for about a year on neighborhood plans, and there

11:54.189 --> 12:04.663
are three that are in the draft stage, so we'll be 
able to move fairly quickly with those three plans

12:05.251 --> 12:10.400
through this whole process of review and 
adoption. And it's very, it's really good. I came

12:13.966 --> 12:16.470
here in 73 as a neighborhood planner. And the 
frustration that we had, those of us who were

12:17.992 --> 12:29.031
neighborhood planners at that time, was that the 
plans were not tied to any kind of implementation

12:17.992 --> 12:29.031
mechanism. But now they will be tied to the CIP, and 
also the CDBG money is under the purview of this

12:29.348 --> 12:38.120
department. So to have a neighborhood plan and 
CDBG in the same department really helps when you

12:38.180 --> 12:47.433
talk about getting the plans implemented, 
because we have the money to implement them. And

12:48.074 --> 12:50.277
then also you have your new development 
ordinance. Right. Yeah. And that would provide a

12:53.181 --> 12:55.744
certain amount of guidance. Yeah, that will have 
less of an impact on us because there isn't a lot of

12:55.994 --> 13:05.202
new development that will take place in our areas. 
And the development ordinance really guides,

13:05.262 --> 13:12.188
sets forth, codifies standards for new 
development. So actually, the planning

13:12.208 --> 13:24.158
resolution is what will impact us more, which is 
council will actually adopt the plans, which

13:12.208 --> 13:24.158
means they'll feel some ownership in them. Some 
identification. Yeah. Of course, there's been

13:26.167 --> 13:47.134
quite a shift in policy direction in the city, away 
from what was almost exclusively attention to the

13:26.167 --> 13:47.134
New Grove fringe areas, to the inward-looking 
redevelopment and recycling of inner-city land

13:26.167 --> 13:47.134
and the land that had been passed over. Of course, 
that's where your interests lie, as I understand

13:47.154 --> 13:52.081
it. And this, of course, would have consequences 
for inner city densities and for commute

13:56.626 --> 14:10.658
patterns, which I guess would be in line with what 
Metro is doing at the moment and whatnot.

14:10.678 --> 14:26.532
Yeah, we actually, again, because we have the 
money to put behind the philosophy, we won't be

14:10.678 --> 14:26.532
able to have a great deal of influence on 
redevelopment by paying for it or creating

14:26.967 --> 14:56.113
incentives we have most of our economic 
development programs are leveraging programs

14:26.967 --> 14:56.113
they're designed to leverage private sector 
involvement so as to make the money go further so we

14:26.967 --> 14:56.113
have a whole package of incentives and the small 
business was one i touched on earlier we also have a

14:26.967 --> 14:56.113
tax abatement ordinance that we're using 
extensively to create in these revitalization

14:26.967 --> 14:56.113
areas tax abatement districts And then we have 
what we call a targeted opportunity program where

14:56.549 --> 15:05.259
we can fund major projects in the inner city areas 
that create jobs. So we have a whole package of

15:05.319 --> 15:12.388
incentives that are available.

15:12.488 --> 15:14.350
I'm interested in public housing. And I don't see 
anything down here called public housing in your

15:15.611 --> 15:20.557
organizational chart. No, the Houston Housing 
Authority is a separate entity in Houston. with a

15:25.912 --> 15:27.594
separate board. You have Housing Finance 
Corporation under your Economic Development

15:27.854 --> 15:31.819
Division. That's about as close as you come to 
public housing, I would suppose. Yes, and that's

15:36.004 --> 15:38.687
not public housing. That entity issues mortgage 
revenue bonds, and we coordinate with them. The

15:46.557 --> 15:50.261
other three that are listed there, we actually 
provide staff support. The tax exempt bond

15:50.802 --> 15:52.864
issuers. Well, the Housing Authority, maybe I'm 
talking to, I should talk with them, but I was just

15:53.722 --> 16:07.041
wondering, you must know what their plans are for 
an Allen Parkway housing project. I know they plan

16:07.061 --> 16:08.323
to sell it. It's occupying very valuable land. 
Yes. And Ephraim was saying that they haven't been

16:13.482 --> 16:22.754
putting people into it for several years. And by 
attrition, it has become almost exclusively

16:23.035 --> 16:33.549
housed by Vietnamese. And

16:33.589 --> 16:39.557
that they're hoping to construct their own or come 
up with their own cooperative housing. Some of

16:45.043 --> 16:47.507
this seems to be quite innovative. Yes, this will 
be the first co-op housing that's been done in

16:47.987 --> 16:54.217
Houston. And it's another thing we're really 
excited about. And everything seems to be falling

16:58.223 --> 17:01.388
into place. HUD is committed. We're committed. We 
have interested developers.

17:10.132 --> 17:10.913
It should happen. As far as I know, the Housing 
Authority hasn't gotten any official word from

17:11.033 --> 17:19.724
HUD as to whether they'll be able to sell the 
project. But it's my understanding that they are

17:20.545 --> 17:28.916
making plans to house people in other parts of the 
city in scattered site housing, though.

17:28.936 --> 17:29.957
Actually, that's the philosophy. It's still 
scattered sites. Yeah. They don't want to do any

17:32.561 --> 17:39.970
more of those giant projects, which are kind of 
hard to keep up. It puts all of the people who have

17:40.220 --> 17:42.845
problems in one place. Well, it 
institutionalizes people. Right. You know,

17:48.534 --> 17:50.778
that's the sad part of it. They just feel caught up 
in something they can't break out of. Well, okay.

17:58.491 --> 18:03.460
Are there any other points you'd like to bring up 
for the history of planning in Houston?

18:07.068 --> 18:13.237
I've seen four mayors come and go. Who were they? 
When I came, Louis Welch was mayor. He represented

18:19.385 --> 18:21.148
the Chamber of Commerce. Well, when he left here, 
he went to work for the Chamber of Commerce. Some

18:26.696 --> 18:29.800
say that he worked for the Chamber of Commerce 
while he was mayor. Some have said that, but I

18:30.020 --> 18:32.444
didn't say that. I'll never say it. And then who 
followed him? Hoffines followed him, then

18:38.890 --> 18:40.973
McCann. Hoffines had two terms? Yeah. And McCann 
had two, I believe. And this is the second term.

18:48.323 --> 18:48.804
He's bankrupt now. He's what? He's bankrupt now. 
Did he declare bankruptcy? Yeah, that's

18:52.649 --> 18:53.730
according to Ethan. Yeah, I saw him the other day at 
a fundraiser, but I didn't. Maybe he's raising

18:57.415 --> 18:58.917
funds to get out. Well, there was a fundraiser for 
the council members. And then, of course,

19:01.080 --> 19:05.366
Catherine. Yeah, yeah. And then you served under 
Roscoe.

19:12.499 --> 19:16.204
Did you have the same area of responsibility with 
Roscoe? No, I was the manager when he left of the

19:16.224 --> 19:23.152
neighborhood revitalization division. So I had 
been, I came as a neighborhood planner, and so

19:24.253 --> 19:31.862
that's been predominantly my work experience. My 
responsibilities expanded. I was promoted. And

19:35.088 --> 19:40.376
my responsibilities expanded, so I was exposed 
for the first time to the block grant. And to

19:41.878 --> 19:46.745
housing programs, I had a lot of housing 
experience that I never had. And also economic

19:47.526 --> 19:50.150
development, that was totally new. What happened 
is, under the previous mayors, the economic

19:50.591 --> 19:57.902
development division was part of the mayor's 
office. And so was the community development

19:57.922 --> 20:00.285
division. So what happened is all those got merged 
and I inherited them. I was the lucky winner. But

20:06.638 --> 20:10.304
it's been a real good experience for me. I like it. 
Oh, yeah. I would think so. I like it a lot. That

20:13.229 --> 20:14.671
would be very challenging. Yeah. In different 
ways. Yeah, a lot of different ways. Well,

20:20.735 --> 20:23.118
Roberta, I want to thank you for your time. You're 
welcome. You'll be getting a transcript of this

20:24.179 --> 20:38.716
whenever we can get around to doing it, and then I 
would like to ask you to review and make any

20:24.179 --> 20:38.716
corrections or additions that come to your mind at 
that time, and return it as soon as you can. As you

20:39.157 --> 20:43.502
know, I'm trying to get a draft together for the 
chapter conference in Houston next year. And I'll

20:48.730 --> 20:53.898
have to start writing it well in advance of the 
actual meeting. Oh, yes. So getting all this put

20:54.760 --> 20:58.205
together is going to be quite a task. Yeah. Thank 
you for your participation. Oh, you're welcome.

21:02.893 --> 21:07.040
Is planning history kind of a niche of yours? I 
teach at A&M. Do you know John Rapps? Yes, very

21:11.107 --> 21:12.008
well. Do you? I was at a reception for him in April 
when they had it during the APA conference in New

21:13.150 --> 21:19.479
York. Oh, yes. And I hadn't seen him since 73. So I 
figured you might know him and that you might be

21:22.303 --> 21:31.696
friends since you're in the same area since I don't 
imagine there are a lot of people in that area

21:22.303 --> 21:31.696
playing him. Well, I was responsible for his 
invitation to our centennial at Texas A&M, and he

21:32.617 --> 21:41.029
gave by far the best presentation for a college. 
Then we're both members of the Society for

21:46.410 --> 21:51.255
American City and Regional Planning History. And 
he's been a big help to me. Thank you. You're

21:58.602 --> 22:01.184
welcome. It's June 26. We're in the office of Mike 
Davis at Metro in Houston. Mike, what is your

22:08.161 --> 22:09.682
title? I'm an environmental planner, 
environmental planner three. OK. What do you do in

22:14.567 --> 22:17.089
Metro? I'm involved with assisting in developing 
environmental impact statements,

22:17.769 --> 22:29.660
environmental assessments on any capital 
projects that Metro does that involve

22:17.769 --> 22:29.660
expenditure of federal funds. That's the 
environmental clearance process. OK. Why don't

22:32.182 --> 22:36.666
you give us a quick rundown on Metro, how it came 
into being? what its mission is and what its

22:37.253 --> 22:42.859
funding is. Okay, why don't we hold?

22:47.924 --> 22:50.426
Okay. So your mission and your funding. Okay, the 
organization was created after a local

22:53.429 --> 23:06.923
referendum where voters were asked if they wished 
to dedicate an extra penny sales tax to fund mass

22:53.429 --> 23:06.923
transit in Houston. When was that? This was in 
1978. The referendum passed, and we've been

23:09.077 --> 23:14.202
operating since that time. Metro was formerly 
known as Hugh Tran and was part of the city of

23:16.384 --> 23:31.378
Houston, operated as the transit department of 
the city of Houston, and had a seriously

23:16.384 --> 23:31.378
deteriorated fleet. It was a typical transit kind 
of development historically. The first transit

23:37.514 --> 23:49.545
in Houston was mule-pulled trolleys on rail 
tracks that progressed to a full streetcar system

23:37.514 --> 23:49.545
that was run by a variety of owners. I think most of 
it was probably developed by Stone and Webster

23:49.585 --> 23:52.728
Engineering. And then eventually, just the 
historical pattern, I'm sure it's not much

23:53.428 --> 24:07.521
different in any city, where the slowly after 
World War II buses became more popular because of

23:53.428 --> 24:07.521
their effectiveness in the suburbanization 
trend. Eventually, the system became severely

24:07.720 --> 24:11.026
deteriorated. And this is typical. The city took 
it over, operated

24:12.969 --> 24:22.064
it in a pretty shabby state because of lack of 
revenue from the system. And then I don't know.

24:26.451 --> 24:29.897
This report will document it much better than I can 
date-wise. There were some stirrings for

24:30.316 --> 24:41.713
improvements to the mass transit system over the 
years, and that eventually led to the 1978

24:30.316 --> 24:41.713
referendum, which created Metro as a 
Metropolitan Transit Authority. This

24:44.137 --> 24:53.110
document... Then, after the authority was 
created, there were some problems with the

24:44.137 --> 24:53.110
directors, as I recall. There were a whole... 
series of executive directors. The executive

24:57.050 --> 25:15.431
director that was on board at the time the 
organization was created left not soon

24:57.050 --> 25:15.431
thereafter, and there were some allocation, some 
problems with what was perceived as extravagance

24:57.050 --> 25:15.431
among the administrative levels of the 
organization. I wasn't here at the time, I don't

25:16.452 --> 25:23.020
know how much of that is true, but I do remember the 
perceptions, just at that time I was I guess in

25:23.995 --> 25:25.817
graduate school myself. At A&M. At A&M. And there 
seems to have been some extravagances. I would

25:32.122 --> 25:48.197
think it would have been just a very heady time just 
to suddenly have promised an incredible mission

25:32.122 --> 25:48.197
and have your funding source secure a relatively 
inadequate source of funding to enable you to do

25:32.122 --> 25:48.197
things right. So I'm sure there could well have 
been some excesses. I'm not the one to speak to

25:52.741 --> 25:54.002
that. I have no proof other than reading it in the 
papers a long time ago. But the important thing is,

26:00.064 --> 26:12.460
overall, the system has improved dramatically 
from its deteriorated state, where we're now one

26:00.064 --> 26:12.460
of the best. We are about the best bus transit 
system for a major city in the US. Seattle's doing

26:18.347 --> 26:20.530
quite well, too. I think the rankings are just out 
on the wards. The American Public Transit

26:23.825 --> 26:27.310
Association gives that every year. And we 
continue to receive high marks because we're

26:28.071 --> 26:37.662
running about 98% on-time performance, which is 
an incredible increase. The miles between road

26:38.563 --> 26:46.132
calls on our buses have increased in excess of the 
100,000 mile mark, and it used to be like 50 miles or

26:38.563 --> 26:46.132
whatever. So the statistics prove that the 
organization has become a very good, solid,

26:51.087 --> 26:54.091
dependable bus transit system. And a lot of the 
problems that you experienced for a few years were

26:54.972 --> 27:07.808
problems over which the organization had no 
control, such as the new buses that kept breaking.

27:08.349 --> 27:19.423
Well, the issue there was one of the largest 
priorities in what Metro defined they needed to do

27:08.349 --> 27:19.423
when they were proposing the sales tax referendum 
was to get acceptable maintenance facilities

27:19.808 --> 27:22.791
online. There was just no provision for 
maintenance. The old Milby Bus Barn site, you

27:26.155 --> 27:32.962
know, used since the horse-drawn days, was the 
only facility that was there. There was no way to

27:33.903 --> 27:38.028
maintain the bus, even if you had the money at that 
time. So one of the earliest projects to go into

27:38.048 --> 27:44.434
effect was building a cashmere operating 
facility. It's a heavy maintenance facility,

27:45.035 --> 27:49.680
which is an incredible facility. Well, I think my 
point is, too, that it wasn't the problem. It

27:55.264 --> 28:01.410
wasn't generated by the city, but because of their 
lack of maintenance facilities, but by the

27:55.264 --> 28:01.410
designer of the buses. That was one issue. Some of 
the buses, some of the earliest buses bought from

28:03.112 --> 28:09.580
Metro and the ones that were inherited from the 
huge . The frames would break. Were the flexibles

28:11.442 --> 28:14.405
that had severe problems. A lot of re-engineering 
went into them. And then aside from those

28:16.187 --> 28:18.790
problems, The buses couldn't air condition 
enough to keep the system cool. And the big

28:24.619 --> 28:27.984
priority was to make the system efficient and 
rideable. And there was no way to cool the buses.

28:29.506 --> 28:32.650
And the air conditionings on those things were 
rebuilt time after time. The problem was

28:33.251 --> 28:34.833
eventually solved. Some major re-engineering 
that the manufacturer had to take on and pick up the

28:35.394 --> 28:40.461
tab for. But some of those buses are still in use. 
And they actually function. The one I ride on, the

28:44.401 --> 28:49.666
82 Westheimer route, is an old bus from that 
vintage. And it will freeze you to death. And so

28:52.008 --> 28:52.789
they do work. We have what's called a hot box at 
Cashmere, which generates excessive

28:53.170 --> 29:00.396
temperatures. And before buying a bus, we test it 
in that box. We superheat it to the equivalent of

29:03.920 --> 29:09.465
being 130 degrees inside. And we time it on how long 
it takes it to cool down to a comfort level for a

29:09.698 --> 29:15.506
person to be sitting in the bus. And that facility 
is used by other transit organizations in the US

29:16.107 --> 29:22.897
who are testing buses. So we've been able to 
develop those kind of facilities to make sure the

29:22.917 --> 29:27.884
system functions. One of the things I have for you 
here to keep on track is this particular document.

29:36.196 --> 29:37.798
It's the document that was developed Metro, 
metropolitan transit for Harris County. State of

29:41.563 --> 29:43.385
July 78. July 78. This document lists the regional 
transit plan. This is the plan that was prepared to

29:47.289 --> 29:59.984
promote the creation of the transit authority, 
and this is the guide that we began with, the

29:47.289 --> 29:59.984
initial comprehensive plan, you might say. This 
document gives you a proposal of the kind of system

30:05.217 --> 30:17.472
that we want to build and announce the existing 
conditions, and proposes

30:05.217 --> 30:17.472
the major issues that we should address. And in 
going through this document, you'll get an idea.

30:19.975 --> 30:31.849
There's developing ideas like developing the 
Contra Flow Lane, which was put into use very

30:19.975 --> 30:31.849
early, developing permanent transit facilities 
and the means of freeways, which is a project that

30:32.335 --> 30:38.604
At the end of our current five-year capital 
improvement plan, we'll have 69 miles of those

30:32.335 --> 30:38.604
facilities. They're going in all over the place 
now. We're building now on Gulf Freeway 29 to the

30:40.848 --> 30:54.287
northwest, North Freeway, the Katy, and we're in 
design on the final design. We've had

30:54.307 --> 30:57.752
environmental clearance to build the one on the 
southwest freeway. Nothing on the southern

30:59.615 --> 31:00.857
freeway? The South Freeway. South Freeway. South 
Freeway is proposing a lot of, it's included as one

31:03.526 --> 31:15.623
of the facilities, a facility probably, I believe 
it's a phase three project. It would be included

31:15.643 --> 31:20.790
also one on the East Texas Freeway, which is 59 
North. Potentially a facility would be included

31:21.811 --> 31:24.475
there. The Highway Department is working on 
initiating a widening project on East Tech's now,

31:27.365 --> 31:39.177
and the cross-section they're acquiring will 
include enough right-of-way for a median bus line

31:27.365 --> 31:39.177
in the middle of the freeway. So those are 
long-range. You must have a good working

31:40.418 --> 31:49.487
relationship with the Division of Highways.

31:49.767 --> 31:55.112
Of course, we all coordinate through what we 
always call the 3C planning process. The

31:55.553 --> 31:57.034
Houston-Galveston Council, the local H2C, is the 
MPO, the Metropolitan Planning Organization for

31:57.571 --> 32:06.379
Houston area. And everything coordinates 
through that. All our projects that we're

32:09.021 --> 32:18.069
proposing go through the clearance process to be 
included on their unified work program, to be on

32:09.021 --> 32:18.069
the transportation improvement program. So that 
everything is coordinated there. We have a good

32:21.232 --> 32:27.477
relationship with them, of course, because we 
have to have their permission to be in.

32:27.946 --> 32:30.931
right-of-ways of freeways and state highways. 
And that hasn't been a problem. The Southwest

32:34.697 --> 32:39.604
Freeway Transitway that's being built is a 
cooperative project with the Highway

32:34.697 --> 32:39.604
Department. At the time they're upgrading the 
freeway, we'll be constructing the transitway

32:40.205 --> 32:45.634
itself. So it's a two-fold project. Upon 
completion, the freeway will have been

32:47.557 --> 32:51.523
rehabilitated in the transitway. And there's 
also There's an organization that is referred to

32:55.182 --> 33:09.343
as the Super Group, which is the occasional 
meeting of the big guys, like the mayors of

32:55.182 --> 33:09.343
Houston. our general manager, Mr. Keeper, and Mr. 
Lanier of the Highway Commission, and all the

33:10.319 --> 33:28.513
folks who are managing the organizations that 
affect the transportation system, who meet on a

33:10.319 --> 33:28.513
relatively regular basis to assure there's 
coordination.

33:29.945 --> 33:31.046
Oh, gosh. I can't remember how long ago the Houston 
Chamber of Commerce initiated the regional

33:31.147 --> 33:49.370
mobility plan, which is sort of like a wish list of 
all the transportation projects that would be

33:31.147 --> 33:49.370
needed to improve travel times and to reduce 
congestion. I think they targeted a 1978 level of

33:49.410 --> 33:59.243
congestion when the project was started to bring 
travel times back to those parameters. So that's

33:59.425 --> 34:06.001
also a coordinating project that the regional 
mobility committee meets on a continual basis.

34:06.021 --> 34:14.903
And we consider the regional transit plan, which 
has now been adopted by the board, to be a component

34:06.021 --> 34:14.903
of that overall plan, too. So the coordination, I 
think, is working very well. We also, you probably

34:19.406 --> 34:25.153
discussed with Mr. Garcia about the new 
comprehensive planning process. Right. I have

34:26.295 --> 34:27.516
that down pat. Okay. You know, Metro's involved in 
that as on the technical advisory committee. So I

34:32.342 --> 34:35.086
feel that coordination goes pretty well. We also, 
one of our missions as a transit authority is to

34:35.186 --> 34:45.379
assist in what we call TSM, Transportation System 
Management Projects. which will improve travel

34:45.983 --> 34:48.126
times for our buses. These are street-level 
improvements to the existing transportation

34:48.727 --> 34:52.752
system. We initially committed, and the 78 
document commits, about $150 million to

34:52.772 --> 35:07.873
cooperative projects with the city of Houston, 
Harris County, and the other municipalities in

34:52.772 --> 35:07.873
our metro region. to do those improvements. So we 
are tied in with the city of Houston's capital

35:09.901 --> 35:20.513
improvement program as a funding source and a 
cooperative builder of a lot of the improvements

35:09.901 --> 35:20.513
in their transportation. Yes. Roberta mentioned 
that. And it was quite surprising to me to hear that

35:26.220 --> 35:35.050
Metro was actually helping to reconstruct some of 
the city streets. We've done some major projects.

35:38.245 --> 36:01.283
grade separations or a lot of them in the 
construction of West Park which is a major

35:38.245 --> 36:01.283
thoroughfare with grade separations and grade 
separations over railroad tracks and some

35:38.245 --> 36:01.283
intersections and that's a continuing project 
that benefits us by getting our buses a non

35:38.245 --> 36:01.283
congested route or a route that's not doesn't 
suffer the vagaries of the railroad schedule,

36:02.174 --> 36:14.026
because that obviously would ruin your ability to 
maintain a reliable schedule for a bus if it's got

36:02.174 --> 36:14.026
to wait for a railroad crossing. We identified in 
this plan we were discussing earlier, the 78 plan,

36:14.046 --> 36:26.618
identifies potential locations for all of the 
joint capital projects that we're proposing. And

36:26.638 --> 36:29.481
we recently looked over a document We made a report 
to the board of directors on how close we've come to

36:30.389 --> 36:39.884
fulfilling this initial plan, and I think we've 
done a very good job. The board recently, within

36:40.145 --> 36:47.076
the last three or four months, approved an update 
of the joint projects list. And so that continues.

36:48.458 --> 36:57.493
One of the things going on right now with the city of 
Bel Air, I don't know if you've talked to Sarah

36:48.458 --> 36:57.493
Janer, and they're working on their tax increment 
reinvestment zone. to revive their little

36:57.929 --> 37:03.856
five-point or seven-point intersection that's 
their downtown. Metro's contributing in that

37:03.876 --> 37:09.803
project, and we're building a transit center in 
the middle of that project. So it's part of the

37:09.823 --> 37:16.731
street reconstruction and bus routing 
improvements that they're doing there. So the

37:16.751 --> 37:19.554
coordination part, I think, is being handled very 
well. It appears to be handled much better than I

37:20.195 --> 37:26.502
think the general perception of the public 
allows. Maybe the media have been doing as much as

37:26.988 --> 37:38.179
they could in terms of indicating how well things 
are working. They always report on when things

37:38.219 --> 37:40.942
seem to fail. Building a project, getting it done 
on time, in budget, that sort of thing is not news

37:43.445 --> 37:49.371
work. No. Only if it's racked with You know, 
structural problems, fraud. Yeah. Yeah. Unless

37:56.237 --> 37:59.741
it's bad, it doesn't get sensational coverage. 
Criminal acts. Yeah. You know, because pretty

38:02.144 --> 38:07.911
much our evaluation shows that we're building 
things on our capital projects. We're doing well.

38:08.752 --> 38:10.294
We're living up to our commitments. Only 
revisions that time in engineering and planning

38:11.255 --> 38:16.801
approve. There's some cases where a project just 
isn't going to work as it was originally proposed

38:19.064 --> 38:24.209
when you get down to, you know, specific planning. 
In most cases, our capital projects are going as

38:25.009 --> 38:28.392
proposed. Our operations have improved 
dramatically, as we were discussing before.

38:36.440 --> 38:47.670
Reduction in the number of accidents and 
improvements in service and on-time performance

38:36.440 --> 38:47.670
and the fact that the buses are clean and safe and we 
operate our own security force. Do you have any

38:48.562 --> 38:51.346
radio communication on your buses? All the buses 
are tied to a communication system. And the bus

38:55.151 --> 39:00.758
system is completely connected. They all have 
two-way radios. They can communicate back and

39:02.120 --> 39:03.763
forth. If there's a problem on a bus, it can be 
relayed to a central communications center

39:03.863 --> 39:11.273
that's located out at our cashmere maintenance 
facility. From that location, they handle

39:11.753 --> 39:17.421
dispatching the transit police if it's a security 
problem. Or, you know, maintenance issues are

39:17.755 --> 39:21.322
handled there. In a case if a bus breaks down on Post 
Oak, you can call in immediately and a substitute

39:21.342 --> 39:31.762
bus can be sent out to deal with the problem. You 
know, or other buses can be rerouted from their

39:34.715 --> 39:38.722
route to pick up the patrons to reduce the lag time. 
What we're also doing, we have a major capital

39:39.103 --> 39:57.955
project that's a surveillance control system 
that we're building on the Katy Freeway, which

39:39.103 --> 39:57.955
will be an infrared communication system that 
will allow you to monitor the entire length of the

39:39.103 --> 39:57.955
transitway. with on-site cameras for security 
purposes and to see if vehicles are broken down on

39:58.272 --> 40:06.771
the transit way and to monitor the location of the 
vehicle. So it will be a major system that

40:06.811 --> 40:12.202
hopefully will eventually be extended to all the 
transit centers. Has Metro considered other

40:12.222 --> 40:15.690
modes of transportation? Sure. In developing the 
regional plan, which this first document

40:19.210 --> 40:32.670
reflects and which some of these later reports get 
you into more specific analysis of the regional

40:19.210 --> 40:32.670
plan, a technology assessment was done. And a lot 
of different technologies have been looked at.

40:40.001 --> 40:46.150
The basic conclusion of that assessment is that we 
will remain primarily a bus system. Even given our

40:46.535 --> 41:02.837
current proposal where phase two would be a system 
connector linking transit centers and transit

40:46.535 --> 41:02.837
ways and local routes, that would be about 14 miles 
of light rail, surface rail with overhead

40:46.535 --> 41:02.837
electric power source. Even given that scenario, 
we will still be primarily a bus system with

41:02.857 --> 41:12.030
approximately 2,000 miles worth of local routes 
operating in our region. There are areas where

41:12.110 --> 41:16.356
congestion warrants, travel time warrants, 
potential ridership and operations savings

41:16.792 --> 41:32.236
warrant building some fixed guideways and that's 
what the board's currently mulling over in phase

41:16.792 --> 41:32.236
two in what in the quarter we're evaluating now. 
With the changed focus of the new planning and

41:37.227 --> 41:54.569
development department under Captain Whitmer 
toward infills within the inner city and more

41:37.227 --> 41:54.569
attention to redevelopment and recycling of land 
closed in. That might be building densities that

41:55.390 --> 42:05.783
would be more amenable to fixed rail than would 
have been historically the case. This is a real

42:07.822 --> 42:19.700
difficult issue and it continues to plague the 
board and they're trying to make a decision about

42:07.822 --> 42:19.700
the actual nuts and bolts of what our regional 
system will look like.

42:22.565 --> 42:24.968
That density issue is, I think, an interesting 
one. I'm not sure that even to our current planning

42:28.831 --> 42:39.033
horizons of year 2000 to year 2010, that that will 
make a major difference. It comes down to looking

42:39.193 --> 42:46.890
at primarily the biggest demand upon our transit 
system will be home-based work trips, commuting

42:47.680 --> 42:54.390
from home to work, regardless of where home is, 
whether it's inner city or suburban. And

42:55.391 --> 43:04.845
providing that service requires looking at 
activity centers that are developed and

42:55.391 --> 43:04.845
providing service to them. In the course of doing 
that, I think you can adequately provide service

43:06.287 --> 43:17.383
to major activity centers to people inner city 
through the local system. And then for the

43:18.106 --> 43:34.084
congested corridors, the freeway corridors, 
getting people from the suburbs into activity

43:18.106 --> 43:34.084
centers, which are primarily downtown, the 
uptown City Post Oak area, the Greenway Plaza

43:18.106 --> 43:34.084
area, and the Texas Medical Center. Those are our 
primary activity centers. Serving those areas,

43:36.406 --> 43:48.079
we need the transitways, the fixed guideways, to 
get you from suburban locations into these areas

43:36.406 --> 43:48.079
and to get you between them. the local route system 
that's developed feeds into that proposed

43:48.329 --> 43:59.343
grander system of fixed guideways and provides 
really good travel times. So I think even given to

43:59.363 --> 44:12.801
sum up the highest densification you could 
predict based on that planning initiative, the

43:59.363 --> 44:12.801
comprehensive planning process, I think the 
local routes would still provide the best

44:13.287 --> 44:16.031
service. Because if it is a dense system, it needs 
frequent stops. And frequent stops would not

44:20.036 --> 44:28.348
likely justify a heavy capital fixed guideway 
system. To achieve some kind of operating cost and

44:28.568 --> 44:39.784
increase your speed and efficiency, you have to 
limit the number of stops

44:28.568 --> 44:39.784
that are made. One thing I should probably do to 
just get us on track is we went through several

44:42.751 --> 44:50.925
planning refinements based on this toward the 
board's development of a regional transit plan.

44:51.867 --> 44:58.959
This was the initial proposed system and then the 
board and staff have continued to study the issue

44:51.867 --> 44:58.959
from that time and provide that plan. What our 
regional transit plan They considered a variety

45:02.815 --> 45:09.782
of options, and you are probably familiar with the 
options A, B, and C discussions that were done. So

45:09.802 --> 45:18.130
by 1984, we had a system that looked similar to the 
one referred to in this map. I'm referring to

45:18.150 --> 45:24.056
regional transit planning background briefing 
material, fall of 84.

45:26.298 --> 45:32.164
Getting to that required some initial planning 
efforts, Bob, where we looked This is before my

45:32.735 --> 45:35.399
time, so I hope I don't get them out of sequence. We 
looked at an original corridor that looked like

45:35.779 --> 45:46.834
it's where we should look at putting a fixed 
guideway system, that there was the population,

45:35.779 --> 45:46.834
the density, the ridership. That's the West Park 
Southwest corridor. The original proposal was to

45:51.099 --> 46:00.852
run a heavy rail facility from about,

45:51.099 --> 46:00.852
I guess, Willcrest, a north-south running 
thoroughfare in West Houston along the West Park

46:01.372 --> 46:12.632
alignment to where it transitioned into the 
southwest freeway alignment intercity running

46:01.372 --> 46:12.632
into downtown and being subway downtown. That was 
the original proposal that was eventually

46:13.814 --> 46:21.227
refined into what was called a spine corridor 
report that expanded that. That alignment was

46:21.427 --> 46:24.713
extended further west I think, to Highway 6. Or no, 
excuse me, to Westvale, which is inside Highway 6,

46:28.058 --> 46:45.296
running back along that same West Park alignment, 
running through downtown and north to Crosstown,

46:28.058 --> 46:45.296
which is north of town, which greatly expanded the 
length of that system. That was proposed as a heavy

46:45.336 --> 46:47.238
rail system. The authority does not have the legal 
authority to issue bonds based on our sales tax

46:54.713 --> 46:57.762
revenue without voter approval. And when the 
authority went to the public for a vote on issuing

46:58.806 --> 47:05.145
bonds to Bill,
