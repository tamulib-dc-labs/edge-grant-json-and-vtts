WEBVTT

00:01.752 --> 00:04.435
It meant that he didn't talk very much with 
students. Yeah, that's why. But all the students

00:07.337 --> 00:09.359
liked him. Ha ha! And he'd

00:10.981 --> 00:18.008
come in the classroom, he wouldn't have much to 
say.

00:21.691 --> 00:28.418
But it was always something that was catching to 
the students and

00:30.355 --> 00:38.864
they knew it was coming and they would wait till it 
came and then they'd get busy.

00:43.429 --> 00:47.253
So then he demanded hard work and the students did 
it. And the students did it. He never had any

00:50.696 --> 00:58.825
trouble with the students at all as far as I know.

00:58.845 --> 00:59.265
How about Marsteller. Well, Marsteller was a 
graduate from Ohio State too. Most of the men were

01:07.980 --> 01:16.562
graduates from the northern schools and came 
south. But C-3, Blackburn, he was from New York.

01:23.095 --> 01:29.022
And he got his training in the school in New York. 
Cornell? No. Yeah, Cornell. And then there was

01:34.288 --> 01:38.713
Wright. Yeah, Lewis Wright. Lewis Wright. And 
Wright, I forget now what school he was from. And

01:44.660 --> 01:47.123
then there was... Oh, oh heck. Who was the other 
one? Leonard, Leonard, Leonard Schmitt.

02:00.709 --> 02:02.171
Schmitt, there was Hilbert Schmitt. Oh, Schmitt, 
yeah. Schmitt, he taught, he taught pathology in

02:03.733 --> 02:10.662
school, but he was glad to remain him himself. And 
he was working for the Extension Service.

02:18.191 --> 02:18.291
Yeah. And Ralph Dunn. Dunn was working for, he was 
an Ohio State man too, but he worked for down at the,

02:20.839 --> 02:46.860
what we call a clink, and he

02:20.839 --> 02:46.860
worked for the

02:48.308 --> 03:01.124
the board of the

02:48.308 --> 03:01.124
college that had to do with Benedict

02:48.308 --> 03:01.124
Mason. And he was considered a

03:01.625 --> 03:17.505
man of the faculty, but he mixed

03:01.625 --> 03:17.505
with the boys used to sing.

03:23.117 --> 03:24.399
Was he a good teacher, Dunn? Well, he didn't teach 
very much. He was mostly an outside man.

03:36.135 --> 03:37.157
How about Blackburg? Was he a good teacher? Well, 
Blackburg, yeah, he was a good teacher, all right.

03:41.803 --> 03:47.391
But his diction was rather funny and uh being from 
new york being from new york well it took a good

03:47.894 --> 04:14.948
while to get a season in until the boys that that

03:47.894 --> 04:14.948
had to be seasoned and so by the way he's he's he he's 
a doctor in new york in new york Oh really? He went

04:17.075 --> 04:18.136
back to New York? He went back to New York and took 
medicine. And he, I don't know whether he's living

04:23.764 --> 04:29.031
or whether he's, what he's doing. But once people 
got to under, became, or could understand him,

04:31.594 --> 04:38.163
then did you like him? Did the students like him? Oh 
yeah, they liked him all right. He was very good to

04:41.888 --> 04:44.732
the students. I don't think the vet department had 
any trouble at all while he was out there.

04:56.427 --> 04:57.068
And Schmitt. Who? Schmitt. What did you think of 
him? Well, Schmitt was a graduate from A&M and

05:00.251 --> 05:15.208
worked for the same

05:00.251 --> 05:15.208
place that See at A&M with the, I can't

05:16.015 --> 05:30.892
think of it now. The headquarters used to be in the 
old, it's out there now, but the building was, when

05:30.932 --> 05:44.487
it was vacated, they took it over. and they had all 
the officers, the male and female, of course they

05:44.669 --> 06:05.017
have both of them now, and they had ten because it 
was first being formed that A&M and then it went

05:44.669 --> 06:05.017
from there over the state. Let me see what, oh heck. 
Was he a good teacher? Oh yeah, yeah. He was a very

06:14.655 --> 06:16.938
good teacher. He taught pathology. And what about 
Lewis Wright? Wright?

06:32.560 --> 06:36.406
I thought we'd taken up Wright before. He was a very 
good teacher and he taught But I thought we had

06:42.905 --> 06:45.668
taken him up. Okay, okay. There was another one, 
too. Yeah. A guy by the name of Bailey Bethel. Who?

06:51.833 --> 06:53.795
Bailey Bethel. B-E-T-H-E-L, Bethel. He was 
teaching there at the time. You probably didn't

06:58.440 --> 07:01.042
have him, then, did you? No, I didn't have him. 
Okay. No, he was there the four years I was there.

07:07.008 --> 07:08.449
And Lenard, August Lenard. Lenard, August 
Lenard. He was the... He got his veterinary

07:12.335 --> 07:31.020
medicine at,

07:12.335 --> 07:31.020
I believe he went to school at, I believe at

07:12.335 --> 07:31.020
Kansas City. And then when he graduated and 
everything, well he came down there and started to

07:33.022 --> 07:39.591
work the vet department at A&M. And he taught

07:43.926 --> 07:50.813
vet medicine. I mean, sure he taught vet medicine, 
but I mean, he taught obstetrics, whatever, he

07:51.234 --> 08:01.905
taught obstetrics. But he did. Now what, when you 
went out in the field as a veterinarian for four

08:03.527 --> 08:08.953
years, did you feel Looking back, did you feel that 
A&M at the college or school of vet medicine then

08:09.389 --> 08:15.835
had given you a good education? Did they prepare 
you? Yeah, they prepared me about as good as it

08:19.239 --> 08:27.828
could be done.

08:30.610 --> 08:31.852
Plenty of clinical work. Men all over the state 
were sending animals to A&M. Because that's the

08:38.397 --> 08:42.962
only place they had to send them. And they put them 
in a, either they came in a car or they came in a

08:42.982 --> 08:55.675
trailer, hitched to a hitched to a car and came to 
College Station with a horse. So there was an

08:57.557 --> 09:00.440
emphasis on clinical work down then. You got a lot 
of experience before. Yeah, it was a lot of work on

09:04.182 --> 09:06.306
clinical work. I got a lot of experience. Before 
you even graduated, right in school you got plenty

09:07.748 --> 09:11.755
of experience. Oh yeah. Did you know when you were 
out in the field working for the state, did you know

09:14.680 --> 09:20.871
other veterinarians? Oh yes. And who were not 
graduates of A&M? I met quite a few of them. And

09:29.242 --> 09:37.598
could you compare, did you think that your 
schooling at A&M was better than theirs or could

09:29.242 --> 09:37.598
you make some comparisons, do you remember?

09:41.385 --> 09:50.102
Well,

09:41.385 --> 09:50.102
we didn't have much to do with the fellows that 
wasn't graduates. from a recognized school. We

09:54.861 --> 09:57.804
didn't have very much to do with them. And they 
didn't, they didn't phone in and have someone come

09:57.824 --> 10:06.414
out to help them.

10:09.698 --> 10:10.599
As far as I know. Did your vet school, did the fact 
that you were a veterinarian and then a practicing

10:11.159 --> 10:18.908
veterinarian for four years, did that help you in 
medical school? Well, see I took a veterinary

10:20.373 --> 10:27.700
medicine to help me a whole lot in medical school.

10:33.806 --> 10:38.291
Now let's talk for a minute about that famous 
football team that you were on. Could you tell me

10:40.593 --> 10:44.977
the positions that you played on the football team 
here at A&M? Well, I was a quarter and a half back.

10:50.039 --> 11:19.033
and

10:50.039 --> 11:19.033
playing and we were either started the game or we 
went in later on and

10:50.039 --> 11:19.033
relieved the men that were either hurt or they were 
tired and needed some further rest and we would

10:50.039 --> 11:19.033
have to go in and run the team just the same as as they 
were there. There

11:22.613 --> 11:27.819
wasn't any jealousy. In other words, there was 
good spirit among the team members? There was good

11:32.383 --> 11:35.206
spirit among the team members. No

11:37.028 --> 11:45.517
man was better than anybody else. They were all the 
same.

11:50.705 --> 11:57.172
when that whistle blew to start the game, we was 
ready to go. And when we were out practicing during

11:57.192 --> 12:07.463
the weekend, during the week, well we was always 
there on time. Bob was our coach then. And he was the

12:13.270 --> 12:20.678
coach of A&M for seven or eight years before he went 
to

12:21.788 --> 12:24.871
Oh, he went north.

12:28.434 --> 12:51.593
In 17 he had to go and straighten the team out and he 
fought half the men that was on the team and put the

12:28.434 --> 12:51.593
second class men because the others, they didn't 
want to put out any. And so when

12:52.585 --> 13:07.863
Bob, the first two or three weeks when he was there, 
well, he got a leave of absence from A&M. And that

13:08.984 --> 13:10.606
was a 17 team, too. Yeah, yeah. That was some team 
that you were on. Yeah, I was on the same team, 17 and

13:14.611 --> 13:17.574
19. Yeah, mm-hmm. And that was the year that the A&M 
team had that remarkable record of nine wins and no

13:23.011 --> 13:27.636
losses. Yeah, well we had the same thing again in 
19. Had nine wins and no losses. And one year we

13:35.545 --> 13:40.891
scored 275 points and didn't allow the opponents 
to score one point. That's right. That was

13:42.493 --> 13:44.115
absolutely fantastic. Now how can, why do you 
think, what was, why were we so good? Well, We were,

13:52.272 --> 14:00.045
just like I said before, there wasn't any jealousy 
amongst the boys, and they all prayed to win. And we

14:02.049 --> 14:03.251
did win. And we were clean about it. Wasn't any men 
on it that would hurt anybody. And so they...

14:18.243 --> 14:20.226
They just won. We didn't kick a field goal. I could 
drop kick 40 yards. Yeah, I know. You kicked a field

14:25.272 --> 14:29.037
goal against SMU. Yes, right. The 40-yard one. 
Yes, right. They held in that victory. Yeah. It was

14:33.784 --> 14:37.569
12, 16-0, I believe it was. Yes, it was, 16-0. 16-0. 
And so we didn't... In fact, Ben's Bible didn't

14:49.090 --> 14:51.373
like to kick. He said,

14:51.874 --> 14:57.000
score first and hold the score. Well, they would 
get down pretty good, 10, 5 yards, but you couldn't

14:58.662 --> 15:03.608
go any further. And they didn't have sense enough 
to kick the ball and get three points. Well, the

15:11.759 --> 15:14.202
three points helped. But they didn't do it, so 
they... They

15:19.482 --> 15:24.008
beat themselves. Yeah, right.

15:29.775 --> 15:33.880
Do you remember the equipment that you used to have 
back in those days? Well, it was

15:35.041 --> 15:42.030
very light stuff. Yeah. Very light. And everybody 
that could bought their own. Oh, really? Oh, yeah.

15:51.894 --> 15:54.137
The school didn't supply the equipment then? They 
had equipment, but if you could buy your own

15:54.157 --> 16:04.829
equipment and meet that inspection, well, we 
could use it. Sure. And many of us boys used our own

16:06.451 --> 16:14.000
equipment, but they were light. They were good 
stuff, but they were light. Do you think that they

16:18.764 --> 16:20.166
were too light? I mean, do you think that they 
didn't protect against injury? Well, we didn't

16:23.791 --> 16:26.234
have very many hurt then. Oh, good. Very few knees. 
We didn't have any knees and we didn't have any

16:29.979 --> 16:32.382
ankles. Good. Great.

16:40.493 --> 16:44.499
I was thinking about that the other day.

16:46.501 --> 16:48.484
Now you have a good many of them. Ankles are getting 
very prominent now. Yes, they certainly are. You

16:55.971 --> 17:04.522
never heard of an ankle fellow being hurt with a bad 
ankle, a broken bone ankle, anything like that.

17:06.525 --> 17:13.273
How

17:06.525 --> 17:13.273
do you think that is? Well, I think the reason why 
the... You see, a bone that's just

17:19.244 --> 17:35.745
fractured very lightly, and it hurts at the time 
that it happened. But by a week, it's in pretty good

17:35.765 --> 17:38.969
shape. And no man, as far as I know, no one played.

17:48.522 --> 17:51.765
except those that wanted to. And if they were good 
enough to play, well, they played. If they wanted

18:02.056 --> 18:07.221
regular team.

18:10.825 --> 18:13.067
So that's the way it was. I wanted to ask another 
question. Sure, go right ahead, ask all you want.

18:16.731 --> 18:17.972
Okay, I wanted to... ask if

18:18.492 --> 18:34.055
World War I had any impact on A&M because you were, 
this is the same time when you're in college that

18:18.492 --> 18:34.055
the United States is fighting in World War I. Did 
that war seem to have any impact on the college? Do

18:38.501 --> 18:39.242
you remember? Oh, it didn't have, it didn't have 
very much. It didn't have very much. Did you ever

18:47.491 --> 18:49.874
think about going into the Army? I was in the Army. 
And when was that? I was in the Army in World War I and

18:53.699 --> 18:57.704
World War II. And,

19:00.147 --> 19:07.015
see, the first war didn't last for about 18 months. 
Yeah, right. And the second war lasted four and a

19:08.376 --> 19:11.020
half years. Yeah. Another five years. And so when 
did you go in for World War I? Well, when I was,

19:16.593 --> 19:27.805
let's see, I went in there during the early part of 
17. Early part of 17.

19:33.691 --> 19:41.760
And as soon as I was released, well, I went on out. 
Well, see, I was at A&M all the time. Yeah, I don't

19:45.144 --> 19:46.245
understand. What you don't understand about it? 
Well, if you were at A&M all the time and you were in

19:50.483 --> 19:58.373
the Corps, you were also in the regular Army at the 
same time. Well,

19:59.454 --> 20:15.895
see, in the first war, I wasn't 18

19:59.454 --> 20:15.895
years old until If I remember correctly, I was 
about mid-season.

20:26.525 --> 20:28.948
So I played the whole year.

20:32.013 --> 20:37.120
Before I was 18 and after I got in the Army, they had 
to call me. They had to draw my number and my number

20:37.140 --> 20:40.706
was tall. Oh, I see. See, they drew the numbers. put 
all the stuff in a hat and capsule and shake it up and

20:46.537 --> 20:54.430
then they'd reach in there and get one. But they 
never did get my number. So I never was called. So

21:00.099 --> 21:07.310
you registered for the draft then, but you never 
were called to serve in World War I? No, I was,

21:07.611 --> 21:13.540
let me see. No,

21:15.376 --> 21:30.418
I was in the Army, but I wasn't called up to work for 
them. Right, right. Okay.

21:38.550 --> 21:45.180
Okay, I was also wondering about, there's been a 
lot of changes in the vet school since You went

21:45.667 --> 21:46.528
there. The only change that's been made that I know 
of is

21:47.689 --> 22:13.632
the new men that they hired out there,

21:47.689 --> 22:13.632
when they came to A&M, I think they were hired A good 
many of them were graduates from the school. And

22:20.372 --> 22:43.753
then when all the girls got in there, 125 or 135, I 
forget how many, when the school opened for them

22:20.372 --> 22:43.753
to sign up for the classes, well, they had 125 
girls. They

22:44.830 --> 22:50.157
wanted to come to A&M because the boys were there. 
Yeah. And so they had a big class.

23:02.033 --> 23:05.678
Were you in favor of allowing women? No, I wasn't in 
favor of that. Why not? Well, I just, I don't know. I

23:12.488 --> 23:14.070
just wasn't in favor. Mm-hmm. But

23:15.627 --> 23:28.465
when they hadn't had it in the house, I took it as it 
was.

23:31.769 --> 23:43.305
Now as a final question, I'd like to just ask your 
overall opinion of A&M.

23:54.338 --> 23:59.523
If I had to do it over again, I'd go right

23:54.338 --> 23:59.523
there. That's the best way I could put it. If I had to 
do it over again, I'd go. And I'd take the same

24:07.951 --> 24:21.443
subjects as I did before and

24:07.951 --> 24:21.443
stay with it until I graduated.

24:25.844 --> 24:34.096
Now, we had one man that I haven't called a name yet 
that taught out there.

24:43.330 --> 24:53.185
Well, we've talked about Mark Francis and 
Marsteller and Dunn, Bethel, and Leonard,

24:43.330 --> 24:53.185
Wright, Blackburg, and Schmitt. And those are the 
people that I had on my list. Now there might have

24:58.700 --> 25:04.888
been one or two more that I missed of people who 
taught out there during your... I don't know.

25:06.130 --> 25:10.555
Bethel,

25:06.130 --> 25:10.555
what Bethel was that? Bailey Bethel. And we don't, 
and I'll have to go back and check in my books. on

25:16.908 --> 25:19.752
him, but I think he was listed as a teacher. He must 
have been listed as a teacher. And who else was it?

25:23.496 --> 25:24.518
Dunn, Ralph Dunn. Well, Dunn was... We talked 
about him. Perry Marsteller. Yeah, he was all

25:27.822 --> 25:28.983
right. And Francis Leonard. Yeah. And we talked 
about Louis Wright. Yeah, Wright. He was a

25:34.831 --> 25:37.474
full-time man then, too. Mm-hmm. And Blackburg, 
we talked about him from New York, and Schmitt. And

25:42.701 --> 25:43.201
Schmitt. Mm-hmm. Well, he didn't leave there. He 
graduated there in,

25:47.076 --> 25:57.226
what did he graduate in? He took vet medicine and he 
was from a town over there close to,

26:11.431 --> 26:13.935
Well anyhow, he's in Texas and he's over that way. I 
can't tell you where he's from. Now, right now, I

26:16.940 --> 26:28.638
don't know exactly where he's from, but he was a 
very good man and

26:16.940 --> 26:28.638
he taught pathology. And so

26:29.540 --> 26:39.075
I don't... I don't remember anything else about 
the fellows that taught me. There

26:48.571 --> 27:09.855
was one other fellow there, tall, slender, black, 
dark,

26:48.571 --> 27:09.855
and he went in the Army and landed over at

27:12.772 --> 27:16.916
He landed at the post. What was his name?

27:25.486 --> 27:28.008
Oh, heck. I can't call his name, say my name now. But 
he was a good man. He was a good man. I can't call his

27:35.897 --> 27:37.538
name, but he was a good man. You didn't mention him 
in that list that you had. Well, I'll have to go back

27:41.408 --> 27:43.994
to my office and check then.

27:51.191 --> 27:52.234
I might have missed somebody. Let's see if I got 
this light.

28:10.214 --> 28:12.056
Well, I'm out of questions now. I think we've 
answered questions about the football team and

28:12.777 --> 28:26.634
about your opinion about A&M and about the vet 
school and your classmates and your teachers.

28:26.994 --> 28:36.586
Well, you know, the vet school,

28:26.994 --> 28:36.586
they moved. They already moved. Yeah, I know they 
did, yeah. across the railroad track. Now they're

28:43.339 --> 28:45.322
going to have a medical school there. Yeah, I know. 
I see them building. They're putting up a

28:47.365 --> 28:53.813
four-story building there. What's your opinion 
of that? Well, I think it's very good. You think

28:56.918 --> 28:57.919
it's about time? Yeah. Because there's a good many 
of the subjects that they teach that can be... the

29:10.390 --> 29:18.561
boys that are taking medicine can take and get 
credit. Especially

29:18.842 --> 29:31.479
physiology,

29:18.842 --> 29:31.479
pharmacology, bacteriology, histology.

29:33.763 --> 29:39.030
Those four things right there They can, it's in a 
war. What were your favorite classes when you were

29:46.084 --> 29:50.349
in vet school? What subjects did you like the most? 
Oh, like the most? Well,

29:55.835 --> 30:04.284
I liked them all. I don't know whether you like, We 
liked one another.

30:12.830 --> 30:14.152
You basically liked them all. I liked them all. 
Good.

30:23.827 --> 30:37.587
I don't believe,

30:23.827 --> 30:37.587
but while I was at A&M,

30:23.827 --> 30:37.587
I didn't flunk a subject. four years and I didn't 
flunk subjects. And then when I got four years and I

30:41.803 --> 31:02.907
was married and when I went to medical school and 
the

30:41.803 --> 31:02.907
professors there, they knew more about me than I 
knew about myself. I couldn't tell them anything,

31:02.927 --> 31:05.049
they knew it all. And so, You thought it was a great 
experience then for you. Sir? You thought it was a

31:13.712 --> 31:17.197
good experience, a great experience for you. Oh 
yeah, yeah, yeah. And it was hard for me to, it took

31:20.282 --> 31:27.852
me six months, about six months to get used to going 
to school again. Because I was accustomed of being

31:29.214 --> 31:36.244
associated with the law.
