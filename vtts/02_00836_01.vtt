WEBVTT

00:01.246 --> 00:04.149
for Mrs. Kimball's cultural geography class. I'm 
interviewing Sam Lampo in Bryan College Station.

00:12.717 --> 00:14.479
This is Sam J. Lampo. I live at 601 Gordon Street. 
And I live with my son-in-law since my wife passed

00:19.884 --> 00:25.669
away. And I was born in 1900.

00:32.465 --> 00:39.752
And when I was two years old, we moved to a location 
on Dilley-Chartef. My father bought the land,

00:40.833 --> 00:48.020
bought 107 acres of land and paid $10 an acre. We 
struggled to pay for it, but in about three years,

00:50.102 --> 00:55.187
we got it paid for. And from then on, of course, I 
went to part-time school, stayed with my parents.

01:01.675 --> 01:06.181
and if I could, when I'd go to school. We went to an 
old country school, which we used to call Mount

01:07.342 --> 01:11.808
Prayer. Well, my land was transferred to another 
school, which was Prospect. And the reason it was

01:21.841 --> 01:29.691
transferred was, we were going to Prospect, but 
Mount Prayer before was because there was a big

01:21.841 --> 01:29.691
creek, and every time it would rain, Well, I had to 
spend the night with somebody because I couldn't

01:30.295 --> 01:36.164
get home on account of high waters. So anyway, they 
transferred our land back to Prospect

01:37.466 --> 01:48.803
and went there until I was about 17 years old. In 
fact, I went up to the seventh grade.

02:00.434 --> 02:05.861
Went to Dallas, stayed about a month or two, worked 
with my sister and her husband. They had a little

02:05.881 --> 02:07.824
store, and I helped them in the store. But in 1920, I

02:08.745 --> 02:20.700
married my wife, Lena ,, who we had two kids. We had a 
daughter in 1922 and a daughter, a son in 1925, who

02:20.740 --> 02:28.450
was Josephine . Lampo Ruffino and my son, Johnny 
Lampo, runs the... runs the bakery, farmer's

02:29.037 --> 02:45.079
bakery here. Farmer's bakery and a kolache shop. 
Well, we go back a little further. My daddy came to

02:50.987 --> 02:55.213
this country in 1984, in 1884.

02:56.358 --> 02:58.361
He stayed in Louisiana about three years. Three of 
my brothers and sisters were born in Louisiana,

02:58.661 --> 03:04.130
and then they moved to Texas. And they 
crop-shared, farmed for a few years around until

03:06.053 --> 03:19.693
in 1902 then, we bought, like I said, we bought 300 
acres of land. So... I was married three years and

03:23.240 --> 03:30.971
making a crop for myself. I moved to Bryan, to the 
city of Bryan, and was, by the way, I was born just

03:30.991 --> 03:40.945
two and a half miles from the city limit of Bryan. 
And I moved to Bryan and went to work for Lawrence

03:42.488 --> 03:50.880
Grocery Company, that $12 a week. And I worked for 
$12 a week for a period of about four or five years.

03:59.760 --> 04:02.885
And eventually I got a big raise. They raised me to 
$15. It was a time at that time that depression was

04:05.829 --> 04:08.233
coming.

04:10.897 --> 04:18.930
By that time, I was saving a little money out of that 
$12 a week on a raise of $15 because I spent it. and

04:19.552 --> 04:21.014
didn't save any. But time passed by, and my two kids 
were born, like I say, one in 1922 and one in 1925.

04:32.711 --> 04:48.613
From

04:32.711 --> 04:48.613
then on, I worked for Lawrence Grocery Company, 
and later on I became a shipping clerk. And then

04:49.235 --> 05:00.564
later on I

04:49.235 --> 05:00.564
became assistant manager and then manager of 
Lawrence Gross Company for a few years. And

05:01.725 --> 05:10.032
finally Lawrence Gross Company sold out to 
Kimball and I went to back work for Kimball.

05:10.052 --> 05:19.140
Well, after working for Kimball about a year and a 
half, I've always wanted to go into the retail

05:10.052 --> 05:19.140
business and I had accumulated a few dollars by 
that time. Time got good after Roosevelt was

05:19.458 --> 05:23.984
elected and things began to get better. And I 
bought Charlie Ball's store on 25th Street in

05:24.545 --> 05:30.532
Bryan. And we stayed there for nine years and had 
good business. As we were doing the Korean War, the

05:36.180 --> 05:45.111
Bryan Air Base was opened and we got a lot of 
business from the boys at Bryan Field. somebody

05:46.981 --> 05:55.633
that may know what Bryan Field is, a blind training 
school, one of the first, I think, that was built.

05:55.653 --> 06:00.860
And they had quite a few soldiers there and a little 
air corps, really. And a lot of people from Bryan

06:02.062 --> 06:03.804
worked there. But as time went on,

06:05.266 --> 06:16.161
we finally, in 1949, we thought that we'd We had 
enough of the grocery business. And so we stayed

06:18.618 --> 06:21.202
home. We sold out. And I actually retired. And that 
was in 1958.

06:33.419 --> 06:42.452
So after being retired about a year and a half, I was 
beginning to lose strength. I didn't do anything

06:43.445 --> 06:52.557
but watch TV, and I decided I better go back to go to 
work and get a little exercise and nothing else.

06:54.180 --> 07:00.007
And I went to work for Barney Morrow, who had a 
meatpacking and killing plan. I just answered the

07:00.027 --> 07:04.093
telephone, and I take orders. Finally got out of 
it, and it was the sale of my family. From then on,

07:08.699 --> 07:12.304
about a year, I imagine, And then my son Johnny 
bought the Easyway Drive-In, which is on 2612

07:12.892 --> 07:22.863
Texas Avenue. Now it's still the Easyway 
Drive-In, but in the meantime, we sold it to the

07:23.183 --> 07:31.612
U-Totem, and the lease was over. They didn't renew 
the lease, so we had to take it back. And my two

07:36.016 --> 07:41.262
grandkids, Johnny Lampo and Frankie Lampo are on 
it now, and they are operating. And, of course,

07:50.412 --> 07:52.294
it's a fabulous business. In the meantime, my son 
had opened it, had built the building right next

07:53.496 --> 08:08.532
door to the drive-in, and built a place for the fish 
and chips. And they stayed about a couple of years.

08:11.461 --> 08:12.483
And of course, they went broke. And we had to take 
the building. And we made a bakery shop out of it,

08:14.725 --> 08:20.332
which is, we call it now, the Farmer's Bakery. The 
Farmer's Bakery Shop, Kolache Inn. And this is

08:26.140 --> 08:30.745
what we've done at the present time. When we opened 
up the bakery shop, I worked, just helped them for a

08:31.546 --> 08:37.434
while, for about a year, and then retired again. So 
I'm still retired.

08:43.207 --> 08:48.873
You mentioned that you had gone to school in a 
one-room schoolhouse. That's right. What

08:50.494 --> 08:51.716
exactly was that like? Well, it was just one-room 
school. It taught all grades. And we had one

08:58.022 --> 09:02.727
teacher who was a lady. Her name was Mrs. Lloyd. She 
was Mrs. Lloyd Smith at that time. And now she would

09:09.313 --> 09:12.977
have passed away a few years ago. And that one-room 
school, it was so bad that we never hardly used the

09:13.818 --> 09:19.644
door. We went out through the windows and through 
the walls. And in other words, it was just, it

09:24.909 --> 09:27.311
wasn't really a school. It was just a barn. But we 
learned a little bit. And like I say that later

09:31.456 --> 09:38.683
after that, we moved to, they transferred us back 
to gospel school. And they went... They went to the

09:41.189 --> 09:46.637
seventh grade. After the transfer, they 
transferred our land to the prospect school. I

09:52.105 --> 09:53.206
went there two years. And of course, like I say, I 
graduated from there. And it was a one-room, it was

09:59.636 --> 10:02.440
a one-room school. And they finally made a 
three-room school out of it. They added a couple of

10:05.664 --> 10:06.986
rooms. And it was a lot nicer school, a new school. 
And we had two teachers.

10:18.181 --> 10:29.553
We

10:18.181 --> 10:29.553
got quite a bit of experience and education out of 
it. Like I said, we wanted to go from there. We moved

10:32.596 --> 10:36.319
to Dallas and stayed a while and come back to Bryan 
and married. What did you want to be when you were

10:38.241 --> 10:39.883
growing up? I didn't know. I didn't have any idea 
where to go except that I wanted to get out of the

10:41.982 --> 10:48.031
farm because there wasn't too much in it at the 
time. We had sort of kind of a depression on and off

10:48.051 --> 10:54.501
there. But this particular time, the best crop I 
ever made was in 1923 and it was the last. So I sold

11:01.712 --> 11:03.354
out everything I had. I had two mules and a horse and 
four or five cows and all plowed too. You needed

11:10.755 --> 11:11.677
them big. You could buy them all for $100 probably 
now. It takes $50,000 to start a farm now. It's a lot

11:18.847 --> 11:21.431
different. But no such thing as a tractor. We did 
have a riding planter to plant that cotton with.

11:28.241 --> 11:32.187
But that's about as far as mechanical that we got as 
a riding planter. Was cotton the main crop? Cotton

11:34.130 --> 11:35.572
was the main crop, yeah. We raised a little corn, 
but not very much. What happened when you moved to

11:39.415 --> 11:44.845
Dallas, when you moved off the farm? When I moved to 
Dallas, I stayed with my sister and helped him in

11:44.865 --> 11:49.955
the store. And my brother-in-law decided they'd 
move to California. And then I came on back home. By

11:58.290 --> 12:02.959
that time, I was about 19 or 20 years old. On the 31st 
day of October, I married my wife. That was October

12:07.442 --> 12:10.385
in 1920. And we lived a happy life until 1965. She 
passed away. Since then, I've been living with my

12:19.354 --> 12:22.517
daughter. What did you think of, was Dallas a big 
city? Dallas was a big city then, yes. At that time,

12:30.465 --> 12:31.866
we probably had five or six thousand people in 
Bryan, maybe seven. And of course Dallas probably

12:35.498 --> 12:41.165
had a couple hundred thousand. Did you like it? No, 
I never was too much for city life. I used an open

12:46.752 --> 12:58.305
country to hunt rabbits, and actually that, for a 
long time, rabbits was our meat, wildlife was our

12:46.752 --> 12:58.305
meat, because we weren't able to buy it. Of course 
in the holidays, We would buy meat during the whole

13:00.297 --> 13:03.380
getting time. We'd kill a hog and make a lard and put 
up bacon and sausage. And the only thing that we had

13:13.091 --> 13:18.657
to buy was coffee and sugar and stuff that we 
couldn't raise. We had chickens and turkeys and

13:19.718 --> 13:24.864
all kinds of eggs we needed. What was the trip like 
going from here to Dallas? Well, I went on a train. I

13:31.726 --> 13:32.948
enjoyed that. I still would enjoy a train ride now. 
I was hoping that they'd put the soundtrack

13:37.573 --> 13:40.436
through here. During the time that they had the 
railroad after my wife and I were married, I made a

13:41.357 --> 13:47.343
million trips to Dallas. I have a brother. I still 
have a brother there. And he lost his wife also, by

13:50.287 --> 13:53.911
the way, within six months of my wife. And he stayed 
with his daughter. And I go to that business now

13:56.963 --> 14:00.207
once in a while, but I go on the bus. It's not like 
riding that Sunday. So I

14:04.512 --> 14:17.188
don't know too much of any experience that I might 
have had.

14:18.990 --> 14:22.694
Have you ever been to Italy to see your father's 
parents? No, I'm one of the few guys, I believe,

14:25.988 --> 14:33.278
that in my younger days, I wanted to travel, but I 
never was able. When I finally got able to travel,

14:33.438 --> 14:37.243
my health kind of broke down. And I didn't want to 
get too far away from home. But I never did have any

14:41.469 --> 14:48.037
desire of going back to Italy or any foreign 
country. I have never set foot outside of the

14:48.058 --> 14:55.928
United States, never. I've taken a few trips to 
California.

15:04.234 --> 15:05.395
But I haven't. We went to Memphis, Tennessee one 
time when my brother-in-law moved. And between

15:12.141 --> 15:15.404
this time, he moved to Memphis, Tennessee. At that 
time, Memphis had 17 lumber mills that made

15:15.424 --> 15:21.270
different things. And we thought that my brother 
would have two grown brothers. They could easily

15:25.133 --> 15:26.995
get a job there, so we all We got our clothes and 
moved to Memphis. We left in October, and it was

15:33.452 --> 15:36.936
warm here. We left, of course, in our comfortable 
clothes. But we had all our winter stuff, like

15:41.100 --> 15:45.945
quilts and blankets and stuff like that, packed in 
a truck. And we shipped those by rail, by railroad.

15:49.929 --> 15:54.214
Well, when we got off the train, there was about a 
foot's of snow in the streets of Memphis. And boy,

15:55.156 --> 15:57.659
you talk about trees, and they're not frozen. And 
it took us a month before we got our trunks closed,

15:58.300 --> 16:08.011
or I want to close them. And at that time, I don't 
know whether many people remember the first gas I

16:08.031 --> 16:14.678
ever saw. This is like Lone Star gas here. The first 
gas I ever saw was in Memphis. And we had to put a

16:22.908 --> 16:24.910
quarter in the meter. according to two quarters or 
three quarters or four quarters. And it would burn

16:29.550 --> 16:34.995
as long as that quarter lasted. And when you run 
out, you're in the middle of a cooking meal, and you

16:35.696 --> 16:42.523
didn't have a quarter, you was out of luck. So it was 
quite an experience. We stayed there about a

16:44.585 --> 16:46.747
month. And one of the experiences I had in Memphis 
during Christmas At my age, say at that time I was

16:52.750 --> 16:58.178
around 12 years old, I had the measles. And all I 
could do was look through the window and watch the

16:58.198 --> 17:02.104
streetcar come by. And we stayed there 30 days and 
moved to Dallas. When we moved to Dallas, we bought

17:07.151 --> 17:12.058
a grocery store. Well, my two bold brothers came 
from the country, you know, and they saw them

17:12.078 --> 17:17.646
pretty girls in Dallas. Well, they went kind of a 
little blind, you know. And they left me and my

17:20.190 --> 17:21.812
father. to run the store. Well, he was well up in age 
by then. And I went to school sometime in Dallas,

17:26.122 --> 17:30.587
too. And we didn't stay that long enough to move. 
But we were good. And to be frank with you, we were

17:35.733 --> 17:39.418
losing money every day. And we just sold out. We had 
a fellow that won't buy it, and we sold it out before

17:41.060 --> 17:44.564
we went broke. But my mother was a thrifty woman. 
She always kept money away from us. All of us. We

17:51.797 --> 17:52.718
didn't know what she had. And when we moved back in 
Bryan, we were my father and the rest of the family

17:53.760 --> 17:59.830
were worried how we were going to fight. Our team 
back didn't know if we started farming. In the

18:01.713 --> 18:07.502
meantime, we had rented our land for one year to one 
of the neighbors. He was working there. And he made

18:10.286 --> 18:16.056
39 bales of cotton out here while we were in Dallas. 
And we lost that. And we had to come in and We were

18:19.387 --> 18:29.075
just wondering where we were going to get the money 
to buy the team back and the wagon and everything.

18:29.095 --> 18:30.957
My mother said, Joe, buy the mill. I'll furnish the 
money. She had $4,000. No one knew she had. She had

18:35.781 --> 18:39.805
saved all these years. While we was still out in the 
country at home, we bought some property in town.

18:47.311 --> 18:48.212
Of course, we... I had that paid for when my daddy 
passed away in 1929. And my mother passed away in

18:53.527 --> 18:57.652
1945. And they left us with a start to some of the 
inheritance that I had when I bought the store.

19:09.925 --> 19:12.647
What was Brian like when you came back? Brian was, 
before I moved to Brian, I mean, into the city of

19:17.622 --> 19:19.265
Bryan. The streets were just as muddy as you've 
ever seen in your life. We sold people out in the

19:25.316 --> 19:29.244
country. And they had boardwalks made out of 
two-by-twelve to walk across the street, no

19:29.264 --> 19:40.845
sidewalks or nothing. It was a rough deal for

19:41.551 --> 19:47.479
a while. And while I was working for Lawrence Roach 
Company, we had all these big farmers that they

19:49.241 --> 20:00.797
would hitch six mules to one wagon, maybe once a 
month. They had commissaries out in the farm. And

20:04.762 --> 20:09.448
we would load 2,000 pounds different items on each 
wagon. They'd come in six wagons, four, eight.

20:14.940 --> 20:22.810
We'd put 2,000 pounds, 20,000, 20 bags of beans, 
100 pounds, 20 sacks of potatoes. In other words,

20:23.191 --> 20:25.393
2,000 pounds to the load. And they'd do that about 
once a year. We had no, we had one little truck when I

20:29.518 --> 20:33.483
went to work, when I first came. A little T-model 
Ford that you had to hand crank. And that was the

20:36.967 --> 20:39.891
pain when the thing was hard to start. Well, 
anyway, it wasn't long. It wasn't too long before

20:42.694 --> 20:47.820
we got better trucks, and we went on. And we were 
well financed when we sold out there. The main man

20:51.444 --> 21:04.419
that had 51% of the stock, he thought everything

20:51.444 --> 21:04.419
would come through. And he decided to sell it to 
Kimball. and left a bunch of us without a job. At

21:10.070 --> 21:11.833
that time, I was a salesman. When the Depression 
came, I lost my manager's job.

21:19.044 --> 21:20.346
I went to sell it. I took the salesman's job. They 
let about seven or eight boys go. But I stayed gone

21:28.618 --> 21:30.280
one week. They called me back. They had too many 
going, and I had to go to work on just common labor.

21:35.294 --> 21:36.755
Went back to $12 a week. And from then on, of course, 
we arrived at $15 to $25. Then NRA come in, if you

21:41.980 --> 21:45.262
remember that right. You know, you don't 
remember, but you might have read about it. Roy

21:48.886 --> 21:49.726
Lavelle come in. He closed the bank before he got to 
his office in order to close all the banks. And we

21:56.672 --> 22:00.115
never... Would it disturb you all to share all your 
books? We'll be through in just a little bit. We'll

22:03.603 --> 22:14.118
be through in just a little

22:03.603 --> 22:14.118
bit. The NRA. The NRA come in and they had to raise my 
salary.

22:23.534 --> 22:30.922
We made pretty good money, and then it went on up, on 
up, started going up

22:23.534 --> 22:30.922
then. About 1940,

22:31.002 --> 22:39.091
then World War II broke out. You never had any 
desires to join the military? I wasn't old enough.

22:44.957 --> 22:52.225
See, in 1942, I was on the,

22:44.957 --> 22:52.225
when the war broke out, I wasn't 18 yet. But in 
November, not in November, but the end of World War

22:55.786 --> 23:05.780
II, I just had registered. Wait a minute, let me get 
that straight. In World War I, I just had

23:07.342 --> 23:11.928
registered. And in August, and on the 11th, the 
armistice was signed, and they never did call me.

23:21.501 --> 23:23.123
And then when World War II comes, I was too old. I was 
42 years old. I don't think anybody over 35.

23:34.201 --> 23:38.225
So I missed both wars, and I regret it now, but I was 
glad then. I don't know. There's a lot of little

23:40.527 --> 23:46.092
things that happened to me during all this time. 
It's hard to just think about them all at one time. I

23:50.857 --> 23:51.237
had them. I'll tell you this, though, that's what 
had happened in my family. I had a sister who was

23:54.659 --> 23:58.925
born in Italy. She was the only one that was born in 
Italy, and the rest of us were all born here. And she

24:06.495 --> 24:09.098
married a widow with four kids. I think it was five 
kids. And she had five of her own. And one day, she

24:17.910 --> 24:21.915
stroked off to the... lake that for some reason or 
another one of the kids flipped in the air in this

24:23.178 --> 24:36.537
lake and she tried to save him and either one of them 
could swim. I lost five

24:37.399 --> 24:43.267
nephews and nieces and she died also. She was 
drowned also. That was one of the greatest

24:44.769 --> 24:48.435
experiences of my life. A sad experience. It's one 
of the tragedies in the family. And I had a little

24:55.739 --> 25:05.614
brother who was five years older than I that got 
killed by a mule and kicked him on the side. But I

25:05.654 --> 25:12.764
didn't go to the doctor until he was dead. He had to 
drive,

25:12.784 --> 25:18.553
take it two hours to get to town probably. So that's 
one of the sad experiences for me. Did you have any

25:20.924 --> 25:23.868
brothers that were in the military that were older 
than you? Yes, I had a brother. My oldest brother

25:25.911 --> 25:28.014
still living. He's 87 years old now.

25:32.901 --> 25:38.269
He wasn't married, and he was about 31 years old or 
something like that when he went to the service.

25:40.292 --> 25:44.978
Then in the morning of the armistice, they had 
orders to go up to the front line. Before they got to

25:47.322 --> 25:49.024
the front line, with arms assigned, and he never 
hit the fire. I didn't get the fire shot. So he was

25:55.566 --> 25:57.989
pretty lucky then. And it had hit him at service. He 
was there about 11 months.

26:05.580 --> 26:09.405
He was almost nine and a half years old. And the 
other one is out and has a cataract in him. But he

26:12.830 --> 26:15.213
gets along pretty good. But he's 87 years old. 
That's quite a few years, too, you know. What did

26:20.577 --> 26:23.281
you think of California? Well, I didn't go to 
California really for a good time. I went mostly to

26:27.447 --> 26:29.991
visit my sister. And she had two boys and a 
daughter. And we just had a wonderful time. We

26:37.462 --> 26:41.668
didn't go to any soap opera shows and stuff like 
that. We had tickets to go to have a show. I believe

26:45.874 --> 26:48.778
they called it Breakfast at Sardi or something 
like that. I don't remember who it was. James, I

26:51.322 --> 26:57.651
believe,

26:51.322 --> 26:57.651
was my commentary. And we had tickets to go the next 
Monday morning, but I had to leave that Sunday

26:58.813 --> 27:10.812
because I had to be able to work the next Monday 
morning. It was the first time I ever got on a plane,

27:10.892 --> 27:15.559
a four-motor plane. The

27:16.062 --> 27:26.838
second time I went, we went in three, at least to 
call them, Astro Jet. We had three motors, one on

27:26.858 --> 27:30.824
the tail and one on each wing. We left Dallas at 10 
o'clock and we arrived

27:32.146 --> 27:40.298
in Dallas at... Ten on five. Oh, the time change. 
The time change, two hours. We got that in two hours

27:46.666 --> 27:50.351
and five minutes. And now, of course, they go 
faster than that now. I mean, that was a little bit

27:55.037 --> 28:06.893
too fast, but you could tell it once you get where 
you can

27:55.037 --> 28:06.893
tell it. I'd like to tell you a little bit about my 
father's life. that he told us a lot about because I

28:10.265 --> 28:14.530
wasn't even born. But he was born in 1852. And of 
course, in Italy, they had compulsory military

28:18.794 --> 28:27.323
service then. They always had it. And when he was 
21, he had to go into service. And his father was

28:34.771 --> 28:36.954
dead. His mother was living. And he had a friend of 
his. He didn't even know how to read and write. He

28:44.173 --> 28:49.942
had a friend of his that used to write the letters 
for him, write to his mother. So he told him one day,

28:49.962 --> 29:01.179
he said, John, if you want to write your mother from 
here on out, you'll have to do it yourself, because

28:49.962 --> 29:01.179
as long as I write for you, you'll never learn to 
read and write. He knew the vowels and the

29:01.199 --> 29:04.383
alphabets, you know. Of course, Italian language 
is, you read it. You read it like it's written. You

29:11.803 --> 29:14.105
don't have these silent letters in that. Anyway, 
he learned to read and write. And he belonged to an

29:19.711 --> 29:24.537
infantry.

29:24.637 --> 29:29.362
And they would go on the movers. And they'd have 
these shooting matches. And my daddy got out of the

29:33.867 --> 29:37.731
Army six months ahead of time. because he was a 
sharpshooter. And his company, as long as he was in

29:42.190 --> 29:46.394
the Army, won the first prize. And the major who was 
in charge of the company got to like him.
