WEBVTT

00:01.955 --> 00:09.245
With Frank W.R. Hubert, he was more of a person who 
worked behind the scenes. I'm really not sure if I

00:10.146 --> 00:17.936
ever heard him give a speech, but everyone seemed 
to know him. And he was, if you want to call it

00:18.677 --> 00:27.068
glad-handing, you know, he was right there and 
everybody was coming to him and he was going to

00:18.677 --> 00:27.068
various people. And with every one of these 
people, he was always introducing me. He was

00:32.130 --> 00:35.015
saying, this is Dr. Glenn Johnson. He's one of our 
new faculty members from Columbia University.

00:38.540 --> 00:42.526
And we like what he's doing, et cetera, et cetera. 
And they would then start asking me questions. And

00:46.832 --> 00:53.342
they were just as inquisitive as the faculty had 
been when I first came down there on that

00:46.832 --> 00:53.342
interview. about this non-graded school and the 
lander's interaction analysis and what Jerry and

00:53.845 --> 01:03.212
I were doing with this block program. They were all 
interested in that. Now that block program, Jerry

01:07.413 --> 01:12.682
and I had nothing to do with the formulation of 
that. That was strictly Paul Hensarling, Bill

01:12.862 --> 01:19.774
Graves, and his counterpart at the secondary 
level. They had laid all the groundwork for that

01:20.355 --> 01:24.301
the previous year. And as I recall, the second or 
third year, that was operational. They started to

01:30.411 --> 01:32.695
get some... nice recognition even at the national 
level for that that program that block program so

01:32.675 --> 01:59.644
they get all the accolades for that and i may have 
mentioned this already but one of the other

01:32.675 --> 01:59.644
blessings was having earl rutter with real public 
education experience out in the schools and frank

01:32.675 --> 01:59.644
hubert the same and both of them having a lot of 
experience in the real world of Austin

02:00.451 --> 02:07.342
bureaucracy and politics. That's right. Rudder 
in the Land Office and Hubert in the Department of

02:08.605 --> 02:19.142
Education, and they both knew their way around the 
legislature and other. Did you all have any

02:19.843 --> 02:25.733
interaction in those early years with the 
Coordinating Board? Yes. Anytime we had a change

02:28.955 --> 02:37.805
in our degree program, we had to go over and make 
presentations. They were brief, but there were

02:37.866 --> 02:45.575
more inquiries, you know, why this, why that, and 
getting clarification.

02:49.740 --> 02:52.624
You mentioned something just a second ago. Can we 
back that up? I want to hear it.

03:01.640 --> 03:06.531
Yes, hearing that replay, it finally registered 
with me while you were talking. Another thing that

03:07.312 --> 03:21.623
surprised me and tuned me in to just how 
politically oriented or connected Earl Rudder

03:07.312 --> 03:21.623
and Frank W.R. Hubert were, I remember sitting in 
his office one day And he picks up the phone and

03:22.345 --> 03:38.852
carries on a conversation with Congressman Tiger 
Teague in Washington, DC, which really impressed

03:22.345 --> 03:38.852
me that somebody could do that, pick up the phone 
and talk to a congressman with the power that Tiger

03:38.832 --> 03:49.301
Teague had because he was a very powerful 
congressman and a real spokesperson for Veteran

03:38.832 --> 03:49.301
Affairs and so forth. That was very impressive. 
And I said we made presentations to the

03:50.845 --> 03:54.816
Coordinating Board. make presentations to the 
coordinating board. Our presentations were with

03:57.500 --> 04:00.125
J.W. Edgar's group, but the coordinating board, 
it seems to me we were in the background and there to

04:00.145 --> 04:12.585
answer questions, but it was always the vice 
president or later the provost who really went to

04:13.240 --> 04:20.193
the coordinating board and made presentations. I 
don't think we ever made, I don't recall now in

04:20.273 --> 04:30.813
retrospect ever making a presentation to the 
coordinating board. Did you or your colleagues

04:30.833 --> 04:34.540
work with commissioner jack kenny williams who 
headed the coordinating board at that time did

04:34.807 --> 04:57.540
y'all work with him no he had left by the time i came 
in 67 but i'm sure somebody like maybe don barker or

04:34.807 --> 04:57.540
somebody like that may have been here long enough 
to right in those earliest years what were your

04:34.807 --> 04:57.540
personal goals You must have set some goals for 
yourself. Yes, I really wanted to become the best I

05:01.518 --> 05:15.575
could become and move up the academic rank to 
associate and full professor, establish some

05:01.518 --> 05:15.575
research efforts, and to write. I enjoyed 
writing. I had already written. In fact, when you

05:19.059 --> 05:28.050
brought that up, when I came down for the 
interview, the faculty were were very impressed

05:28.334 --> 05:33.442
that I already had publications in national 
refereed journals. I wasn't even in the college or

05:34.403 --> 05:44.718
university setting, and yet I'd already 
published in pretty prestigious academic

05:34.403 --> 05:44.718
journals. And I always enjoyed writing. Even my 
first year of teaching, I was writing articles

05:48.365 --> 05:56.875
that would appear in the newspapers. And I was 
setting up activities where my students would

05:57.176 --> 06:05.866
become involved. And newspaper photographers 
would come in and photograph. And we'd have a

06:09.951 --> 06:12.534
little caption story to go with it. And I continued 
that kind of writing when I was working on my

06:17.137 --> 06:21.983
master's degree, my doctorate. that type of 
writing plus writing for academic journals. And

06:28.456 --> 06:36.864
when I became principal down at Clayton, 
Missouri, they asked me to assume responsibility

06:28.456 --> 06:36.864
for the Clayton School News. So I assumed that 
responsibility and would have usually an article

06:37.765 --> 06:45.372
in each monthly news that came out. I'd write 
something specifically. So I always enjoyed the

06:47.815 --> 06:50.097
writing. In your first years here, did you have a 
favorite research topic? I didn't have time to

06:55.140 --> 06:59.106
really write that first year. I think the newness, 
the five-course load, the pulling together of

06:59.126 --> 07:12.844
this new block program that Paul and Bill Graves 
wanted us to. to establish just devoured almost

07:12.824 --> 07:17.712
all of my time. So I don't think I had time to really 
do research or write that first year. Of course, we

07:25.485 --> 07:32.095
were putting together proposals,

07:25.485 --> 07:32.095
too, new courses. We were trying to get new courses 
generated. That was time consuming. Now there

07:38.407 --> 07:49.881
must have been some good stories that you can 
recall about you as a non-Texan beginning to have

07:38.407 --> 07:49.881
Aggie students in your classes. There must have 
been some learning experiences you can share.

07:54.006 --> 08:01.815
Actually, I was pretty much impressed with the 
Aggie students.

08:03.128 --> 08:08.635
That first year, I doubt if I had more than two or 
three young men in the courses. They were all

08:08.935 --> 08:09.957
ladies. And they just seemed like very clean cut 
kids. A lot of times, people would be out maybe a

08:15.684 --> 08:24.175
year. and want to become a teacher and they'd have 
to come in and take our courses and they seemed

08:24.779 --> 08:46.163
mature so I really didn't have any great unusual 
stories I just liked these people I thought they

08:24.779 --> 08:46.163
were really really good people and interested in 
doing what they could to improve education. Did

08:53.398 --> 09:01.573
you have any encounters with Aggie traditions in 
those first years? Oh yes, and very impressive. I

09:03.556 --> 09:07.864
mean starting with, and I took in all of them that 
first year. They would talk about silver taps. I

09:10.661 --> 09:13.605
wanted to see silver taps, so I saw silver taps. 
Muster, I wanted to see what this was. I was very

09:17.650 --> 09:18.531
impressed. Bonfire, that first ball before the 
University of Texas game, a game in which we won and

09:18.551 --> 09:26.441
surprised everyone. It was the year where Gene 
Stallings won the Southwest Conference, and we'd

09:26.601 --> 09:33.730
lost the first four games. So nobody was expecting 
this to happen, but... All the tradition and so

09:37.915 --> 09:45.364
forth was extremely impressive. The Corps of 
Cadets was impressive.

09:52.313 --> 09:55.958
The march-ins to the football games, I had to go 
over and see that. Those were all impressive to me.

10:01.825 --> 10:06.471
Do you remember any instances of Aggie good bull or 
pranks in or around any of your classes didn't run

10:07.058 --> 10:27.430
into that in any of my classes but the very first 
yell practice i went with bowled me over because

10:07.058 --> 10:27.430
all these good kids and nice kids and so forth 
suddenly took on a whole different complexion

10:07.058 --> 10:27.430
that midnight yell practice and They were using 
the language that even turned my face red. And I

10:33.260 --> 10:37.244
kind of had a few comments with my colleagues after 
that. When I'd been to my first Yale practice, I

10:37.544 --> 10:44.831
didn't appreciate the language that was being 
used. I liked the enthusiasm and so forth, but the

10:44.911 --> 10:57.703
off-color stories that the Yale healers were 
using just seemed totally out of place with what

10:44.911 --> 10:57.703
I'd seen up to that point. What was your evaluation 
of the quality of A&M students? I thought they were

11:02.849 --> 11:04.851
good students. Now, they were not what you would 
call Ivy League type or Ohio State type students. I

11:14.001 --> 11:19.226
had done a master's at Ohio State, so I was 
surrounded by that. But they were comparable to

11:19.486 --> 11:23.691
what maybe I saw at Kent State. I would say they were 
comparable to that type of student. In those early

11:29.188 --> 11:35.623
years, did they seem, could you categorize them by 
being urban or rural? You said there were more

11:37.247 --> 11:38.951
women than men. Yes. Were they small town? I think 
they were predominantly small town. We were

11:45.128 --> 11:50.553
beginning to draw pretty heavily out of the 
Houston area at that time. We were beginning to get

11:50.613 --> 11:55.718
some trickle from the Dallas area, which 
eventually grew. As I said, everything seemed to

11:56.699 --> 12:01.363
double from year to year. More and more of the urban 
types came in. You saw I saw a change in the wealth

12:09.689 --> 12:14.135
among the students. My first year there, you 
seldom saw anything in the classification of a

12:16.499 --> 12:24.890
Cadillac or a Porsche or anything like that. But 
that started to change rather rapidly. Pretty

12:28.335 --> 12:33.162
soon, these kids were driving cars that I 
certainly couldn't afford to drive. And that was a

12:34.404 --> 12:35.986
big change. So the urban influx and the wealth It 
seemed to change. All right, let's go back now

12:41.922 --> 12:44.005
chronologically.

12:46.188 --> 12:50.394
The College of Education is created in the late 
60s. 69, opened in 69. All right, and Dean Hubert

12:54.039 --> 12:56.342
becomes the dean. And then what was your 
responsibility at that point? Okay, now this was

13:00.047 --> 13:07.978
kind of unique, and this really shows the 
administrative skills of Frank W.R. Hubert. Once

13:08.971 --> 13:24.930
Rudder and he knew that that college was going to be 
formed and going to open their doors in 1969, the

13:08.971 --> 13:24.930
fall, the previous academic years, Frank already 
identified who his department heads were going to

13:08.971 --> 13:24.930
be. He was going to keep Carl Landis, who was head of 
the Department of Health and Physical Education.

13:31.898 --> 13:35.082
That department was in the College of Liberal 
Arts. It would come into the new College of

13:35.422 --> 13:37.965
Education. the head of the Department of 
Industrial Education opted to stay in

13:39.160 --> 13:43.992
engineering. So James Boone became the 
designated department head one year from then.

13:55.546 --> 14:01.795
And that department would come out of engineering 
into the new College of Education. The old

14:02.416 --> 14:06.582
Department of Education would become three 
departments. Ed Administration and Les

14:07.403 --> 14:11.850
Richardson was tapped to head that up. 
Educational Curriculum and Instruction was

14:13.652 --> 14:17.598
called Curriculum and Instruction to begin with. 
And Frank asked me to head that up. So this was my

14:21.652 --> 14:26.178
second year here, and he's already asked me to be 
head of a department. And Art Roach was already

14:27.419 --> 14:33.907
here, and he would head up the new Department of 
Educational Psychology. So the old Department of

14:34.748 --> 14:45.041
Education would disappear, and these three new 
departments would emerge, Ed Psych, Ed

14:34.748 --> 14:45.041
Administration, Curriculum, and Instruction. 
But Frank Hubert had his five department heads

14:45.061 --> 14:48.385
identified. We met with him. It seemed like a 
weekly basis. I'm sure it wasn't every week, but he

14:52.574 --> 14:59.586
was training us to become these three new 
department heads. Carl Landis had the

14:59.726 --> 15:02.010
experience. Jim Boone needed that kind of 
training, just like the three new department

15:02.030 --> 15:08.701
heads would have to have. We went through budget. 
We went through personnel selection. We hired

15:13.349 --> 15:15.132
personnel. We kept records, and none of this, you 
understand, was ever going to go anywhere because

15:15.550 --> 15:27.583
you couldn't process Form 500s to hire people 
under curriculum and instruction. It was still

15:28.084 --> 15:30.226
the Department of Education. Frank wore two hats. 
He remained dean of the College of, was it Arts and

15:33.610 --> 15:39.516
Sciences or Liberal Arts by then? I don't know. I 
don't know. Originally it was arts and sciences,

15:41.525 --> 15:46.870
and I don't know whether there was a split into 
liberal arts. It may have split and become liberal

15:48.571 --> 15:58.060
arts by then, but he remained dean of that college 
and head of the Department of Education.

16:00.682 --> 16:06.728
Paul was stepped down, and Frank became the new 
department. So Frank was wearing two hats. Half a

16:09.280 --> 16:12.204
day, he'd be up in the dean's office. The other half 
day, he'd be down in the Department of Education

16:12.224 --> 16:26.202
working with all these new 2B department heads and 
trying to get the department organized for the

16:12.224 --> 16:26.202
changeover. And I thought his foresight on that 
was just excellent. Because boy, were those five

16:32.230 --> 16:36.115
department heads ready when that door opened the 
following fall time. Based on that preparation

16:42.278 --> 16:52.430
that he gave y'all, what do you think he thought 
were the keys to good leadership?

16:56.214 --> 17:05.545
And I kind of had this impression as I got 
acquainted with and watched Dean Benson function

16:56.214 --> 17:05.545
over in engineering. It seemed to me that Hubert 
and Benson had a similar kind of administrative

17:06.520 --> 17:14.428
style. They delegated. And Frank Hubert kept 
saying over and over to us, as prospect of new

17:16.531 --> 17:29.425
department heads all that previous year, you're 
going to assume responsibility for this. You will

17:30.466 --> 17:32.208
make the decisions. And he kept punching that 
home. And as I watched Benson operate over in

17:37.081 --> 17:44.433
engineering, it seemed like he was operating that 
way too. When he appointed somebody a department

17:44.493 --> 17:48.900
head, they ran the department. And I think he and 
Frank Hubert thought philosophically, if you

17:49.761 --> 17:57.273
can't cut it, we'll get somebody else as the 
department head. But as long as you're in the

17:58.054 --> 18:00.979
department, you're going to run it. And even if I'm 
going to replace you, you're still going to run

18:01.988 --> 18:07.957
until I replace you, you know, type of thing. And I 
like that because I came out, coming out of the

18:09.018 --> 18:16.990
administration, head administration training 
at Columbia University. That was the philosophy

18:17.010 --> 18:19.874
there. That as an administrator, you surrounded 
yourself with people who could assume

18:19.894 --> 18:31.911
responsibility and you turned them loose and gave 
them support. And I always felt that way with

18:32.380 --> 18:39.027
Hubert, that I had the freedom to do and that he 
would support me. Even if he didn't like it, I think

18:39.147 --> 18:43.692
he would still support me.

18:47.756 --> 18:49.218
I think that was his philosophy.

18:52.842 --> 18:56.025
How much was... He a detailed person about dollars 
and cents. Oh, tremendous. He really understood

19:02.925 --> 19:08.535
the financial side of any organization. And when 
we opened our doors in the fall of 69, we were pretty

19:09.657 --> 19:17.612
solid. And I never felt threatened. One of the 
things that I learned coming out of Columbia

19:21.233 --> 19:31.286
University's head administration training 
program was that two things will get you into big

19:21.233 --> 19:31.286
trouble very quickly. And that's personnel 
problems and money. And so I appreciated Hubert's

19:38.114 --> 19:43.341
philosophy, which followed that. You better have 
good personnel morally, ethically, and you

19:47.795 --> 19:51.923
better watch your money. Even the money that he 
would be allocating to the departments, he made it

19:54.207 --> 20:07.491
very clear that it was going to be determined on how 
much student credit hour you could generate. that

20:07.977 --> 20:15.129
he believed in the formula that Jack Kenny 
Williams had established when he was

20:07.977 --> 20:15.129
Commissioner of Education. Jack Kenny Williams 
put that into operation, the student credit hour

20:15.911 --> 20:29.614
formula to finance universities and colleges, 
and Hubert simply carried it the next step, which

20:15.911 --> 20:29.614
was, okay, In this college, you're going to 
function that way. You have to generate student

20:33.875 --> 20:38.527
credit hours and allocate funding. Pretty much 
now there were exceptions, of course. He knew when

20:41.033 --> 20:45.966
somebody was getting a new program started, they 
would need a little extra boost here and there.

20:49.003 --> 20:56.656
When you became department head, do you remember 
who the faculty was, who were the faculty members

20:49.003 --> 20:56.656
in this new department? Yes, well some of the key 
players by that time, I had hired Bob Schuetz, who

20:57.498 --> 21:06.534
would later become head of the department. Five 
years later, I for personal reasons, went up to

21:08.710 --> 21:13.537
Hubert and said, I've got a daughter. We don't know 
what's wrong with her. She's having problems. I'm

21:18.544 --> 21:19.766
feeling stressed. And I really, if you would be 
well, I'd really like to step out of this job. And

21:28.739 --> 21:32.224
Frank's response was almost immediate. He said, 
we're going to do whatever you want to do. And I

21:35.649 --> 21:36.931
said, I want to do that. And he said, well, You know, 
I've got a new idea, and that is we've got some

21:39.473 --> 21:47.176
isolated higher education courses. One over here 
in industrial, and one over here in ed psych.

21:53.564 --> 21:59.210
There's one in your department and a couple in Ed's 
administration. He said, I'd like to see those

21:59.230 --> 22:02.594
pulled together. If you're going to step down, 
would you step in as kind of a coordinator of that

22:02.734 --> 22:10.663
effort? It's not going to be demanding like the 
department head's job, but would you do that? And I

22:16.709 --> 22:18.391
said, yes. And he said, now, second question. This 
shows how quick his mind works. This was out of a

22:25.123 --> 22:27.690
clear blue sky. I went up there and made this 
pronouncement to him that I really wanted to step

22:27.710 --> 22:33.105
down. His next question was, who would be the 
department head of curriculum and instruction?

22:40.562 --> 22:42.184
And I didn't hesitate to either. I said, I know the 
faculty would support Bob Schutz. So Bob had been

22:46.969 --> 22:55.018
one of the first hires that I made because I needed a 
really strong secondary education. Harold was

22:55.559 --> 22:58.502
the guy I was trying to recall. He was Bill Graves' 
counterpart. And he had left or was leaving, I

23:02.294 --> 23:05.919
forget which. So I needed someone now who could 
really head up secondary education. The college

23:12.728 --> 23:26.565
had, or Dean Hubert had interviewed Bob Schutz for 
a research position, assistant dean for

23:12.728 --> 23:26.565
research, and he didn't have those 
qualifications. But the credentials that I saw

23:27.693 --> 23:32.179
were overwhelming. What a find this would be in 
secondary education. He'd been sort of a

23:37.307 --> 23:48.142
coordinator of curriculum for secondary ed at one 
of the California schools. He was co-author of a

23:49.905 --> 23:57.075
whole English textbook series for secondary 
schools. So the offer coming out of the dean's

23:58.287 --> 24:16.954
office to Bob was not for assistant dean for 
research, but would you be interested in coming in

23:58.287 --> 24:16.954
and taking over the secondary education program 
in EDCI where Johnson's head of the department.

24:16.994 --> 24:22.622
And Bob agreed to come in as my head of secondary 
education. Two other key people that I hired was

24:23.383 --> 24:28.210
David David, David dummy and David had that Bob's 
credentials. at the elementary level. He had been

24:34.664 --> 24:41.873
a very successful elementary person in the St. 
Louis County area. And I was very impressed with

24:43.034 --> 24:47.740
his credentials, a graduate of the University of 
Missouri. Bob Shutes was a graduate of Harvard.

24:52.266 --> 24:56.051
And those were the kind of people I was looking for. 
So I brought David in to head up elementary

24:56.131 --> 24:59.395
education. And one thing that had bothered me 
immensely from really the first semester I was at

25:00.252 --> 25:17.756
Texas A&M was the mishandling of a whole area 
called history and philosophy of education. They

25:19.098 --> 25:25.787
were having graduate students teach this who knew 
absolutely nothing about the history of

25:26.240 --> 25:38.312
education or the philosophy of education, they 
would be assigned a senior level history and

25:26.240 --> 25:38.312
philosophy course to teach. And they'd be given a 
textbook. And they'd say, read this book and be

25:42.016 --> 25:48.323
prepared to start classes Monday. And that just 
didn't settle with me. Because if you knew

25:51.406 --> 25:55.470
anything about the history and philosophy 
program at Columbia University. Those were

25:58.834 --> 26:04.223
dynamic

25:58.834 --> 26:04.223
people. They were nationally and 
internationally recognized people like Phil

26:04.423 --> 26:14.280
Phoenix, just a giant in the field. So I wanted 
someone who had the right background. And when I

26:19.128 --> 26:21.812
was up in Chicago, at one of the national meetings, 
I put out the word that I wanted someone in history,

26:22.248 --> 26:33.844
philosophy, and that's when I found Jack 
Campbell. Jack had a bachelor's degree in

26:34.905 --> 26:37.549
history. He had been through the history and 
philosophical foundations program at Columbia

26:38.730 --> 26:47.041
University. He had been head of a department. in 
one of the New York University System schools. He

26:57.437 --> 27:15.441
had gone out to a Pennsylvania school where he was a 
department head and I brought Jack in and Jack

26:57.437 --> 27:15.441
really did understand and know everything and was 
writing in that whole field so I felt a lot more

26:57.437 --> 27:15.441
comfortable with people like Bob Schutz, David W. 
David, and Jack Campbell coming in with those

27:15.893 --> 27:28.735
kinds of credentials, I felt comfortable with 
what they were doing. Did the doctoral program

27:29.376 --> 27:32.461
begin during those years? Yes. When the new 
college was formed, this was another thing that

27:33.122 --> 27:38.391
surprised all of us. Whoever made the 
presentation to the coordinating board, it may

27:39.232 --> 28:07.652
have been Frank Hubert, it may have been one of the 
vice presidents, but whoever, it may have been

27:39.232 --> 28:07.652
some political things behind the scenes, but 
whoever did it, did it right because they approved

27:39.232 --> 28:07.652
right off the bat PhD programs in all five 
departments and EDD programs.

28:09.877 --> 28:17.878
I think industrial education only had an EdD 
program, as I recall, and yet coordinating board

28:18.905 --> 28:25.794
approved EDD and PhD programs for all five 
departments. That immediately attracted

28:27.356 --> 28:32.503
students and our growth was immense. I think that 
first year, by the end of the first year in

28:33.544 --> 28:40.373
curriculum and instruction, we had Something 
like 300 master's degree students and pretty

28:41.332 --> 28:48.120
close to 90 doctoral students. Do you remember 
when the first doctoral degree was completed in

28:48.921 --> 28:53.146
the department? In the department? No. Were you 
department head? Was it in that five years? Yes, it

28:59.994 --> 29:00.955
was. And I think it...

29:07.673 --> 29:09.500
It could have been Jeannie Anderson. I just have to 
go back and look. But she was working on the PhD in

29:12.472 --> 29:17.211
Elm primarily. although it was called curriculum 
and instruction, her area of concentration was

29:18.018 --> 29:25.308
really elementary education and reading. And the 
reason I think she may have been the first is

29:25.328 --> 29:32.098
because Bill Graves was her chairman. And it makes 
sense to me that it would have been someone that far

29:32.118 --> 29:42.853
along who would have come out of curriculum and 
instruction with Doreen. I just don't recall.

29:46.739 --> 29:55.213
Okay, looking back on those five years, what were 
the primary joys and frustrations of being a

29:46.739 --> 29:55.213
department head? Well, the joy, of course, was 
seeing new faculty and new programs flourish.

30:05.279 --> 30:11.305
That was just, you just felt very, very good about 
what was happening. The frustration was the

30:12.266 --> 30:23.597
overwhelming number of students that were coming 
into the undergraduate, master's, and doctoral

30:12.266 --> 30:23.597
program. with limited resources as far as 
providing the number of faculty members so you

30:24.235 --> 30:33.488
could reduce their loads. People, by then, we may 
have been able to reduce their load by only one

30:33.969 --> 30:39.376
course. We were probably down to everybody 
teaching four courses because we didn't have

30:39.436 --> 30:47.307
enough faculty. to go around. And y'all were not 
different from most of the other departments? Oh

30:53.611 --> 30:55.573
no, no, that's true.

30:58.757 --> 31:03.223
What about comparative salaries?

31:03.483 --> 31:06.187
Were we reasonably competitive as far as you 
recall? Not as I recall. I don't think we really

31:08.570 --> 31:12.315
were competitive with your major universities. 
We could never compete with an Ohio State or a UCLA

31:16.311 --> 31:25.541
or a Southern Cal or Ohio State or Michigan. We 
could not compete at that level. But certainly

31:30.026 --> 31:38.235
anyone who couldn't, who wasn't at that level, 
where they could step
