WEBVTT

00:02.157 --> 00:14.314
have the honor and pleasure of being with Mr. 
Sterling Evans at his hacienda out at

00:02.157 --> 00:14.314
Brackettville, and we're chatting about his 
recollections. Mr. Evans, you graduated in 1921.

00:18.520 --> 00:20.142
You were the valedictorian. When did you learn you 
were the valedictorian?

00:26.508 --> 00:44.106
How

00:26.508 --> 00:44.106
long was your speech?

00:47.390 --> 00:49.071
And it was in Guyon Hall. Was Guyon Hall new then? 
The

00:54.098 --> 01:13.451
president was Dr. Bezal. Was he the president at 
A&M then?

01:22.094 --> 01:24.416
Do you have any recollections of him?

01:29.822 --> 01:32.285
I'm going up to interview his daughter soon. She is 
95 and living up in Oklahoma City. So I'm looking

01:38.451 --> 01:40.954
forward to interviewing her. Let's jump forward. 
You became active in former student activities in

01:45.058 --> 01:51.004
the 1940s. What led you to become active? Did 
someone encourage you to, or?

02:07.957 --> 02:08.678
What was his name?

02:15.987 --> 02:17.008
All right, we'll get it later. And what were your 
first leadership, former student leadership

02:17.596 --> 02:22.944
activities? .

02:45.828 --> 02:56.558
Yes, sir.

02:56.598 --> 03:14.434
.

03:15.646 --> 03:23.338
I said,

03:15.646 --> 03:23.338
Governor, I do want to go to school. I said, yes, but 
I promise you, your appointment, I'll try to do a

03:23.358 --> 03:32.392
thing about it, my dear Governor. While he's 
Governor? Yes, that's right. So I went ahead and

03:35.997 --> 03:39.663
appointed him. I could have done it with one next to 
me. I didn't do it because I

03:43.372 --> 03:50.880
promised you. Anyway, we had a president, Senator 
Moore. Bill Moore from? Brown. Yes,

03:54.624 --> 03:57.968
sir. Senator. He wasn't going to approve

03:59.029 --> 04:10.822
anybody's report, so he reported it and it worked 
out very good. I just wanted to say thank you. How

04:11.483 --> 04:11.843
about you? Who

04:14.101 --> 04:38.218
were your biggest allies on the board favoring 
coeducation?

04:40.612 --> 04:43.478
. . . . . .

04:51.193 --> 04:53.338
. . . .

04:57.366 --> 05:02.316
.

05:12.353 --> 05:16.378
Now, John Lindsay was the former student 
president.

05:18.602 --> 05:35.665
John

05:18.602 --> 05:35.665
Lindsay

05:18.602 --> 05:35.665
was the

05:18.602 --> 05:35.665
former student president. John Lindsay was the 
former student president. And

05:37.784 --> 06:02.166
Dick

05:37.784 --> 06:02.166
Hervey helped him, didn't he? I guess he did. What 
is a good one? Now, Mr. Zachary, was he on the board

06:06.843 --> 06:12.189
of directors with you then?

06:19.378 --> 06:20.860
He was not for coeducation?

06:27.187 --> 06:32.473
And let's see, was Al Davies, was he on the board 
yet? Dick Goodson?

06:37.522 --> 06:39.785
Was Mr. Rudder for co-education? Mr. Rudder

06:44.913 --> 07:03.118
was

06:44.913 --> 07:03.118
louder than anybody else. They couldn't change 
the ruling. When

07:07.289 --> 07:15.342
did you personally start favoring coeducation?

07:17.545 --> 07:18.687
Before World War II? Was there any event or 
anything that...

07:20.149 --> 07:30.105
What about making the Corps voluntary? Did you 
favor that? Brother came to it. For a while, it

07:36.242 --> 07:39.667
wasn't very popular. So the boy didn't want to go 
in. So he said, we've got to change the ruling. We

07:44.293 --> 07:46.797
always had a rule at that time. Everybody

07:46.817 --> 07:50.262
had a rule. So he came to the board and said, we've 
got to make changes. And the way before, he said,

07:53.967 --> 07:59.855
OK, but you won't be in my favor. He said, all right, 
you can't do it. Anyway, Rutter was a great fellow.

08:04.370 --> 08:04.871
Yes, sir.

08:08.214 --> 08:23.589
Now,

08:08.214 --> 08:23.589
you said a while ago, before we turned on the 
machine, that if you had been on the board when Mr.

08:08.214 --> 08:23.589
Rutter was selected, you might not have voted for 
him. I wouldn't have voted for him. What do you know

08:25.330 --> 08:27.713
about college education? It's a boring 
experience. Who

08:29.453 --> 08:43.588
was it, as far as you know, that identified Mr. 
Rudder to be the new president? He was on the board.

08:49.754 --> 08:52.737
I was part of that. He came in first president. I was 
in. Where did he first come from? 1958, I believe.

08:59.997 --> 09:01.178
Where did he come from? I believe as executive vice 
president.

09:06.083 --> 09:07.124
He came before the board. He already

09:08.386 --> 09:24.443
established himself. He established himself 
very quickly. For a publication. Yes. He talked

09:25.684 --> 09:26.325
about it very quickly. Now,

09:27.588 --> 09:40.383
the fact that he was from the hill country, do you 
think that helped him any?

09:43.646 --> 09:43.706
No. Now, he also knew John Connolly well, and you 
knew Mr. Connolly well, did you not? Did that

09:53.438 --> 09:55.620
friendship help A&M? What

09:57.710 --> 10:05.639
about connections with President Johnson? Did he 
help A&M, LBJ?

10:16.191 --> 10:23.599
Was there ever any discussion about the admission 
of black students of racial integration?

10:26.222 --> 10:26.282
No. Did anybody oppose it that you recall? I have 
never heard of any opposition. And Mr. Rudder

10:36.104 --> 10:39.928
handled that with great skill. He was a great 
fraud. Yes, sir, he was. Do you remember any

10:45.233 --> 10:49.456
anecdotes or stories about Mr. Rudder that you can 
share? I

10:51.718 --> 10:55.662
don't remember.

10:59.202 --> 11:09.957
We

10:59.202 --> 11:09.957
were

10:59.202 --> 11:09.957
running.

11:11.799 --> 11:16.966
We were running. Great schedule. You saw that. We 
worked for it. Good stuff I did for it. I got a hold of

11:22.995 --> 11:23.676
John that. John did a job to get this back. But it 
doesn't, if we don't got a former student meeting,

11:24.357 --> 11:26.640
we would have that day. But I didn't know a thing 
about that. So I definitely had to go through that.

11:31.180 --> 11:32.602
John did a great job. Oh, yes. Well, he still is. He 
still is. One of the greatest presidents in the

11:35.747 --> 11:39.612
universe. I particularly am grateful that he is so 
interested in the library because I share with you

11:40.033 --> 11:48.305
that interest. What caused you to be interested in 
the library? Well, school. Tommy Bell. Library.

11:57.538 --> 11:59.681
Goodwin. Horner.

12:05.993 --> 12:13.202
You know where that, the Gentosis Society. You 
ever heard of Gentosis Society? No, sir. It was

12:18.869 --> 12:19.430
very important to me. Benjamin Franklin used it. 
Hey, go look at it. When I have a meeting and talk

12:23.955 --> 12:32.866
about what's going on, I go back home and talk about 
it. I have 40 of them. He got the first library book.

12:35.930 --> 12:36.531
Yes. He got the first . He was a good man.

12:50.011 --> 12:53.136
You know what I mean? We got the . You

12:55.700 --> 13:04.333
know, he I used

13:05.967 --> 13:17.808
to wear a pair of paper sometimes. So he had the 
paper, and he was going to talk about it with the

13:17.828 --> 13:23.698
boys. We had that. He was a great person.

13:33.001 --> 13:40.750
Who were some of the other faculty members when you 
were a student that had a very positive influence

13:33.001 --> 13:40.750
on you? .

14:03.545 --> 14:29.932
I

14:03.545 --> 14:29.932
remember, I prayed, how could you do? Don't go 
outside. Because of this guy. And he was a good one,

14:30.733 --> 14:31.274
too. Worked like a different person. But I, I, I 
feel a person.

14:36.265 --> 14:43.052
Straight

14:36.265 --> 14:43.052
A. Now, what was your major? Agriculture. 
Agriculture. Now, you grew up, you went to high

14:50.339 --> 14:53.182
school in Uvalde. Why did you go to A&M instead of 
some other school? Okay. Okay. Did

15:03.232 --> 15:24.761
you ever visit A&M before you enrolled there? 
Let's see who this is.

15:30.923 --> 15:34.829
Did you visit College Station before you went over 
there to enroll? Yes, sir. How did you get there? By

15:38.334 --> 15:40.216
train. Did you go on the train?

15:56.901 --> 15:57.021
Train. I stayed all night between trains. I went 
over to the station. How did you do that? Three or

15:58.723 --> 15:59.344
four hours. And

16:00.573 --> 16:07.043
then you were in College Station how long? Was it 
overnight? Did you spend the night there?

16:16.657 --> 16:19.081
How many in your high school graduating class?

16:21.724 --> 16:22.125
How many?

16:30.003 --> 16:34.647
Now, at Uvalde High School, how many graduated 
when you did? 21. 21. And about how many went to

16:38.651 --> 16:40.473
college?

16:44.136 --> 16:44.477
I don't remember. Did you know that you were going 
to major in agriculture when you got there? Was

16:49.481 --> 16:50.883
that always your major?

16:54.786 --> 16:56.308
Yes, I remember that. It was the Army. Yes, sir. 
Yes, sir. Where did, in what dormitory did you live

17:00.479 --> 17:11.993
when you got to A&M?

17:12.013 --> 17:20.083
B1.

17:20.624 --> 17:20.924
B1? All right. And can you share with me any of, do 
you recall any of the Fish, freshman hazing. What

17:35.538 --> 17:37.602
did the sophomores do to freshmen then? There was 
never a lot of them. I remember we won the football,

17:42.469 --> 17:48.499
basketball.

17:48.519 --> 17:56.692
We won the basketball.

17:56.712 --> 17:56.973
We had a car. We had a plane. We had a pilot. All

17:59.002 --> 18:26.730
right.

18:27.318 --> 18:31.244
What were, you said that they beat you some. What 
would be the reason that a sophomore would give for

18:32.385 --> 18:39.335
whipping a freshman?

18:40.837 --> 18:41.378
Just did it? Was it normally after supper? And

18:47.266 --> 18:56.599
you all ate in, in Sabeasa? Describe a typical 
meal. How was it served? Where did you all sit?

19:20.905 --> 19:22.786
Was Mr. Sabisa still living? Describe him, 
please. Oh, you don't remember. Oh, you say the

19:27.612 --> 19:30.435
food was good. What was your favorite Aggie food?

19:38.203 --> 19:41.166
Anything that you could eat, I guess. You went in 
September. When did you come home? Did you come

19:46.892 --> 19:48.474
home for Thanksgiving?

19:51.937 --> 19:52.798
I don't remember that. But you didn't go to Houston 
or Dallas?

19:58.291 --> 20:04.819
Did

19:58.291 --> 20:04.819
they make court trips then for football games? To 
Waco. And you went on the train? Did you spend the

20:11.366 --> 20:12.508
night?

20:16.652 --> 20:19.055
I don't remember that. When you went on the train, 
did you all get into any mischief?

20:27.907 --> 20:28.668
Probably did. Tell me about your roommates. Who 
was your roommate?

20:48.571 --> 20:49.392
Chemistry major.

20:56.729 --> 20:58.532
Jack Mayhem. Where was he from?

21:08.586 --> 21:09.167
Above Dallas. Let's see it was Mr. Zachary, one of 
your classmates. Year after you and Harrington

21:15.416 --> 21:18.581
also.

21:21.565 --> 21:23.968
Describe them as students. Were they good 
students? Zachary. Was he an engineering major?

21:33.290 --> 21:35.132
What about Mr. Harrington?

21:43.240 --> 21:49.586
Now, one of my favorite Aggie acquaintances was 
Buck Shewitz.

21:51.528 --> 21:53.590
Tell me about your memory of him. Buck Shewitz was a 
great fellow. I wanted

21:57.698 --> 22:06.711
to go study at the art.

22:09.554 --> 22:19.829
My father

22:09.554 --> 22:19.829
said, hey, no, son of mine's not going to study art. 
So I said, you know, we're going to pick up the

22:19.849 --> 22:23.994
library, go to school, go to the library. And I was 
going to go to A&M then. I took classes. They came

22:25.036 --> 22:25.857
and taught one-on-one with you. You couldn't see 
it enough.

22:43.345 --> 22:50.194
Now, I noticed in the Longhorn, the yearbook, that 
Buck was the art editor. Yes, sir. Did you students

22:51.676 --> 22:55.080
think that Buck was a kind of a character? You're 
darn right. He was a character. What kind of goofy

22:58.144 --> 23:00.127
things did he do?

23:04.492 --> 23:04.833
I don't remember. Anything that he wanted to do. He 
was a very good student. He was?

23:11.662 --> 23:11.742
Yes. Delightful. Did he get into mischief?

23:31.007 --> 23:33.450
Now, did you become a collector of Shewitt's art?

23:36.734 --> 23:38.436
I know John Lindsay has a fine... Yes. Now, Tell me 
when you get tired and we need to quit this. OK.

23:49.909 --> 23:56.895
Let's see.

23:57.515 --> 24:04.661
What was some of your favorite courses that you 
took while you were a student? All of them were good

24:04.682 --> 24:06.743
ones. I don't

24:06.763 --> 24:13.309
know. I

24:14.740 --> 24:22.910
recommend, one, do good.

24:39.830 --> 24:40.991
If I decide I'd make good class, good news class, I 
would. That's good. Paying is practical, too. I

24:41.792 --> 24:42.773
think, you know, I think it's really, you know. Did 
you all do some field work then in agriculture?

24:50.893 --> 24:55.618
Where were the field on the west campus? What did 
you all grow? Cotton, corn, what else?

25:02.306 --> 25:02.827
Vegetables. What kind of vegetables?

25:09.615 --> 25:10.055
Turnips. Spinach.

25:16.233 --> 25:18.196
Any tomatoes or lettuce?

25:22.341 --> 25:30.813
When you were taking those courses, what kind of 
agriculture did you dream that you were going to

25:22.341 --> 25:30.813
practice? Did you think you were going to be a 
rancher?

25:42.910 --> 25:43.270
Yes, sir. Can you recall any of the pranks that you 
and your friends pulled off while you were

25:45.730 --> 25:59.711
students? I guess I forget. I don't remember

26:00.612 --> 26:04.578
particularly. Did you fill anybody's room with 
water or trash? Yeah, I did.

26:20.122 --> 26:31.417
Did

26:20.122 --> 26:31.417
you ever put an animal in anybody's room? Didn't do 
that? Because I've heard of some putting a heifer

26:33.140 --> 26:43.093
in somebody's room overnight or a hog or 
something.

26:46.738 --> 26:46.838
Yeah. No,

26:49.028 --> 26:55.055
sir. I don't believe it's there anymore. I believe 
it's been leveled. But it was one of the dorms where

26:58.560 --> 27:02.685
you lived?

27:07.470 --> 27:14.639
I remember

27:07.470 --> 27:14.639
when I was a kid. I remember when I was a kid. I 
remember when I was a kid. Now,

27:19.690 --> 27:38.773
where was the post office then? At Northgate near 
Sabeasa? How often did you get mail from home?

27:51.567 --> 27:54.049
Did you write a letter home regularly?

27:56.672 --> 28:18.294
Now, how did your family pay for you to go to

27:56.672 --> 28:18.294
A&M? $420 off of an acre? Wow. How

28:23.039 --> 28:49.485
often did you all hear news about the war in Europe?

28:52.587 --> 29:16.013
Going

28:52.587 --> 29:16.013
in through the door, I took his hand, and I 
remember, I broke his camera, so I got in, and I was

28:52.587 --> 29:16.013
in the first half of the car, and I just, when I got 
out of the car, I was like, hey, this car, she's just

28:52.587 --> 29:16.013
over there. Because now, we got into the war almost 
the same time you started as a student.

29:28.738 --> 29:36.529
While the war was going on, did any of your close 
friends go to Europe and serve in the Army? No,

29:36.549 --> 29:43.038
they were not. No, they were not.

29:46.672 --> 29:50.037
What did you and your friends do when you heard the 
war was over? Celebrate. How did you celebrate?

30:05.158 --> 30:06.440
You celebrated by doing what?

30:10.166 --> 30:10.847
Oh, to Brian. Where in Brian did you celebrate? 
What was the name of, do you remember where in Bryan

30:13.672 --> 30:18.238
Aggies would celebrate? Now, did those 
celebrations ever involve alcohol?

30:28.872 --> 30:29.634
Not even beer? Was there a... And...

30:41.060 --> 30:47.246
When y'all were looking for a date, where did the 
young ladies live that y'all dated?

30:51.731 --> 30:52.232
Back home, I guess. How often did girlfriends come 
to College Station?

30:59.719 --> 30:59.979
I don't know. Once in a while. And they would come on 
the train? Yeah. And y'all met them? Yes, sir.

31:04.965 --> 31:06.466
Where did they spend the night? Somebody's house.

31:11.468 --> 31:13.952
Did that would be faculty? And did they charge 
anything for the girls to?

31:21.063 --> 31:24.488
Did you have a favorite faculty member that you? 
Who was it?

31:37.869 --> 31:38.370
I don't remember. Did you all celebrate silver 
taps then? Where

31:42.256 --> 31:45.610
was it?
