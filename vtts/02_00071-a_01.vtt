00:01.680 --> 00:06.200
I have the honor and pleasure of being with Mr. 
Sterling Evans at his hacienda out at

00:06.180 --> 00:09.580
Brackettville, and we're chatting about his 
recollections. Mr. Evans, you graduated in 1921.

00:18.180 --> 00:20.020
You were the valedictorian. When did you learn you 
were the valedictorian?

00:28.460 --> 00:44.110
How

00:28.460 --> 00:44.110
long was your speech?

00:47.180 --> 00:49.000
And it was in Guyon Hall. Was Guyon Hall new then?

01:10.880 --> 01:13.300
The president was Dr. Bezell. Was he the president 
at A&M then?

01:21.890 --> 01:24.390
Do you have any recollections of him?

01:29.590 --> 01:32.270
I'm going up to interview his daughter soon. She is 
95 and living up in Oklahoma City. So I'm looking

01:38.100 --> 01:40.920
forward to interviewing her. Let's jump forward. 
You became active. You became active in former

01:46.480 --> 01:50.900
student activities in the 1940s. What led you to 
become active? Did someone encourage you to? What

01:57.150 --> 02:08.640
was his name? All

02:09.160 --> 02:16.890
right, we'll get it later. And what were your first 
leadership, former student leadership

02:20.710 --> 02:22.790
activities?

02:47.840 --> 02:49.643
Yes, sir.

02:54.252 --> 03:03.870
I

02:54.252 --> 03:03.870
did ball. Governor,

03:04.210 --> 03:22.680
I do ball. Try to do a thing about it. While he's 
governor. Bill

03:34.190 --> 03:54.940
Moore

03:34.190 --> 03:54.940
from, yes, sir. I can't approve anybody's report. 
Who

03:59.740 --> 04:38.160
were your biggest allies on the board favoring 
coeducation? I

04:38.140 --> 04:59.760
wouldn't

04:38.140 --> 04:59.760
have done today if it wasn't for you. Now,

05:01.740 --> 05:15.900
John Lindsay was the former student president? 
Yes, sir. The president. How

05:19.220 --> 05:27.174
much?

05:38.435 --> 05:41.320
How many? And

05:41.300 --> 06:02.170
Dick

05:41.300 --> 06:02.170
Hervey helped him, didn't he? I guess he did. What 
is a good one? Now, Mr. Zachary, was he on the board

06:06.580 --> 06:12.200
of directors with you then? He

06:12.780 --> 06:20.800
was not for coeducation? And

06:21.300 --> 06:32.470
let's see, was Al Davies, was he on the board yet? 
Dick Goodson?

06:37.070 --> 06:38.902
Yes. Good, I think he was. Was he on the board for 
coeducation?

07:04.940 --> 07:09.349
Yeah.

07:09.369 --> 07:10.980
I'm with you there. Good to know. And then about Mr. 
Rutter. Mr. Rutter, was Mr. Rutter for

07:13.860 --> 07:18.560
coeducation? He couldn't change the rule. When 
did

07:22.360 --> 07:30.930
you personally start favoring coeducation? 
Before

07:30.910 --> 07:44.820
World

07:30.910 --> 07:44.820
War II? I guess so. Was there

07:45.440 --> 08:06.930
any event

07:45.440 --> 08:06.930
or anything

07:45.440 --> 08:06.930
that...

08:06.910 --> 08:10.943
Yes, sir.

08:12.688 --> 08:16.360
Now, you said a while ago, before we turned on the 
machine, that if you had been on the board when Mr.

08:16.760 --> 08:20.320
Rutter was selected, you might not have voted for 
him?

08:38.740 --> 08:46.840
Who was it, as far as you know, that identified Mr. 
Rutter to be the new president?

08:58.470 --> 08:59.771
1958, I believe. I believe, as executive vice 
president.

09:36.030 --> 09:40.310
Now, the fact that he was from the Hill Country, do 
you think that helped him any? Now, he also knew

09:42.470 --> 09:51.610
John Connolly well, and you knew Mr. Connolly 
well, did you not? Did that friendship help A&M?

10:02.210 --> 10:05.490
What about connections with President Johnson? 
Did he help A&M, LBJ?

10:14.050 --> 10:23.420
Was there ever any discussion about the admission 
of black students, of racial integration? Did

10:24.020 --> 10:30.050
anybody oppose it that you recall? I have never 
heard of any opposition, and Mr. Rutter handled

10:30.550 --> 10:38.280
that with great skill. He was a great fraud. Yes, 
sir, he was. Do you remember any anecdotes or

10:44.220 --> 10:49.730
stories about Mr. Rutter that you can share with 
us? Oh,

10:51.130 --> 11:33.079
yes. Well, he still is.

11:38.900 --> 11:43.720
I particularly am grateful that he is so 
interested in the library because I share with you

11:43.700 --> 11:47.100
that interest. What caused you to be interested in 
the library?

12:10.950 --> 12:11.774
No, sir. Mr. Franklin used it.

12:35.530 --> 12:36.223
Yes. Yes. He got the first one. He was the first. He 
was a good one.

12:54.690 --> 12:55.951
John Rutter and I had the group.

13:23.560 --> 13:24.122
We had that.

13:32.820 --> 13:37.080
Who were some of the other faculty members when you 
were a student that had a very positive influence

13:37.060 --> 13:40.780
on you?

14:06.750 --> 14:07.691
Could you do?

14:13.840 --> 14:14.781
Could this guy? He was a good one, too. He worked 
like a good person.

14:38.550 --> 14:40.071
He traded under him. That was a good deal. That's 
straight A. Now, what was your major?

14:46.760 --> 14:47.496
Agriculture. Agriculture. And now, you grew up, 
you went to high school in Uvalde. Yes, sir. Why did

14:54.370 --> 14:57.840
you go to A&M instead of some other school? Oh, man, 
you're going to have to . Okay. I didn't have to

15:03.325 --> 15:05.520
train much. No, I was going

15:05.500 --> 15:20.920
to

15:05.500 --> 15:20.920
train. Did you ever visit A&M before you enrolled 
there? Yes, sir. Let's see who this is. Yes,

15:27.960 --> 15:31.157
sir. Did you visit College Station before you went 
over there? Yes, sir. How did you go there to

15:34.285 --> 15:35.231
enroll? Yes, sir. How did you get there? The train. 
The train. Did you go on the train? The

15:41.220 --> 16:04.787
train. And then, you were in College Station how 
long? Was it overnight? Did you spend the night

16:12.530 --> 16:13.771
there? Yes, sir. How many in your high school 
graduating class?

16:21.690 --> 16:22.051
How many?

16:30.096 --> 16:34.670
Now, at Uvalde High School, how many graduated 
when you did? Twenty-one. And about how many went

16:38.668 --> 16:40.530
to college? Did

16:40.510 --> 16:49.620
you know that you were going to major in 
agriculture when you got there? Was that always

16:49.600 --> 16:51.460
your major?

16:54.090 --> 16:57.585
Yes,

16:54.090 --> 16:57.585
sir. Yes, sir. In what dormitory did you live when 
you got to A&M?

17:20.640 --> 17:21.045
B-1? B-1. All right. And can you share with me any 
of, do you recall, any of the fish? Freshmen? No.

17:33.080 --> 17:34.366
Freshmen? Hazing? What did the sophomores do to 
freshmen then?

18:28.570 --> 18:32.520
You said that they beat you some. What would be the 
reason that a sophomore would give for whipping a

18:32.500 --> 18:40.980
freshman?

18:40.960 --> 18:43.350
Just did it? Was it normally after supper?

18:51.630 --> 18:57.740
And you all ate in Sabeza? Describe a typical meal. 
How was it served? Where did

19:02.120 --> 19:20.990
you all

19:02.120 --> 19:20.990
sit? Was Mr. Sabeza still living? Describe him, 
please. I don't remember. Oh, you don't remember?

19:27.670 --> 19:28.691
I don't remember. Oh. You say the food was good. 
What was your favorite Aggie food? You

19:34.110 --> 19:41.300
could eat, I guess. You went in September. When did 
you come home? Did you come home for Thanksgiving?

19:48.280 --> 20:01.870
But

19:48.280 --> 20:01.870
you didn't go to Houston or Dallas.

20:01.850 --> 20:07.400
Did they make court trips then for football games? 
To Waco. And you went on the train? Did you spend the

20:11.460 --> 20:20.300
night?

20:20.280 --> 20:26.790
When you went on the train, did you all get into any 
mischief?

20:26.770 --> 20:28.719
Probably did. Tell me about your roommates. Who 
was your roommate? Chemistry

20:34.920 --> 20:49.339

Dallas. Above Dallas. Let's see. Was Mr. Zachary 
one of your classmates? Year after you. And

21:17.160 --> 21:21.640
Harrington also?

21:21.620 --> 21:24.420
Describe them as students. Were they good 
students? Zachary. Was he an engineering major?

21:33.400 --> 21:42.770
What about Mr. Harrington?

21:42.750 --> 21:43.461
Now. One of my favorite Aggie ... acquaintances 
was Buck Shewitz.

21:51.514 --> 21:53.576
Tell me about your memory of him.

22:02.662 --> 22:44.490
Now

22:02.662 --> 22:44.490
I noticed in the Longhorn, the yearbook, that Buck 
was the art editor. Did you students think that

22:52.550 --> 22:55.084
Buck was a kind of a character?

22:58.142 --> 22:59.650
What kind of goofy things did he do?

23:08.421 --> 23:08.921
He was.

23:12.986 --> 23:14.027
Did he get into mischief?

23:31.028 --> 23:32.570
Now did you become a collector of Shewitz art?

23:36.700 --> 23:38.385
I know John Lindsay has a fine. Yes.

23:42.515 --> 23:44.480
Now tell me when you get tired and we need to to quit 
this. Okay.

kind of agriculture did you dream that you were

25:28.000 --> 25:30.795
going to practice? Did you think you were going to 
be a rancher?

25:42.910 --> 25:46.096
Yes sir.

25:47.038 --> 25:52.570
Can you, can you recall any of the pranks that you 
and your friends pulled off while you were

25:52.550 --> 26:00.751
