00:01.680 --> 00:06.200
I have the honor and pleasure of being with Mr. 
Sterling Evans at his hacienda out at

00:06.180 --> 00:09.580
Brackettville, and we're chatting about his 
recollections. Mr. Evans, you graduated in 1921.

00:18.180 --> 00:20.020
You were the valedictorian. When did you learn you 
were the valedictorian?

00:28.460 --> 00:44.110
How

00:28.460 --> 00:44.110
long was your speech?

00:47.180 --> 00:49.000
And it was in Guyon Hall. Was Guyon Hall new then?

01:10.880 --> 01:13.300
The president was Dr. Bezell. Was he the president 
at A&M then?

01:21.890 --> 01:24.390
Do you have any recollections of him?

01:29.590 --> 01:32.270
I'm going up to interview his daughter soon. She is 
95 and living up in Oklahoma City. So I'm looking

01:38.100 --> 01:40.920
forward to interviewing her. Let's jump forward. 
You became active. You became active in former

01:46.480 --> 01:50.900
student activities in the 1940s. What led you to 
become active? Did someone encourage you to? What

01:57.150 --> 02:08.640
was his name? All

02:09.160 --> 02:16.890
right, we'll get it later. And what were your first 
leadership, former student leadership

02:20.710 --> 02:22.790
activities?

02:47.840 --> 02:49.643
Yes, sir.

02:54.252 --> 03:03.870
I

02:54.252 --> 03:03.870
did ball. Governor,

03:04.210 --> 03:22.680
I do ball. Try to do a thing about it. While he's 
governor. Bill

03:34.190 --> 03:54.940
Moore

03:34.190 --> 03:54.940
from, yes, sir. I can't approve anybody's report. 
Who

03:59.700 --> 04:38.160
were your biggest allies on the board favoring 
coeducation? I

04:38.140 --> 04:59.760
wouldn't

04:38.140 --> 04:59.760
have done today if it wasn't for you. Now,

05:01.740 --> 05:15.900
John Lindsay was the former student president? 
Yes, sir. The president. How

05:19.220 --> 05:27.174
much?

05:38.435 --> 05:41.320
How many? And

05:41.300 --> 06:02.170
Dick

05:41.300 --> 06:02.170
Hervey helped him, didn't he? I guess he did. What 
is a good one? Now, Mr. Zachary, was he on the board

06:06.580 --> 06:12.200
of directors with you then? He

06:12.780 --> 06:20.800
was not for coeducation? And

06:21.300 --> 06:32.470
let's see, was Al Davies, was he on the board yet? 
Dick Goodson?

06:37.070 --> 06:39.310
Yes, sir. Was Mr. Rudder for coeducation? He could 
take

06:42.090 --> 07:05.220
the ruling.

07:09.660 --> 07:15.320
When did you personally start favoring 
coeducation? Before World War II? Yes, sir. Was

07:20.132 --> 07:23.320
there any event or anything that,

07:27.670 --> 07:29.730
what about making the Corps voluntary? Did you 
favor that? Yes, sir.

07:38.966 --> 07:45.140
We always had room.

08:04.270 --> 08:04.877
Yes, sir. Good for you. Now,

08:07.770 --> 08:16.360
you said a while ago, before we turned on the 
machine, that if you had been on the board when Mr.

08:16.760 --> 08:20.320
Rutter was selected, you might not have voted for 
him?

08:38.800 --> 08:46.820
Who was it, as far as you know, that identified Mr. 
Rutter to be the new president?

08:58.490 --> 08:59.771
1958, I believe. I believe, as executive vice 
president.

09:36.030 --> 09:40.310
Now, the fact that he was from the Hill Country, do 
you think that helped him any? Now, he also knew

09:42.470 --> 09:51.610
John Connolly well, and you knew Mr. Connolly 
well, did you not? Did that friendship help A&M?

10:02.210 --> 10:05.490
What about connections with President Johnson? 
Did he help A&M, LBJ?

10:14.050 --> 10:23.420
Was there ever any discussion about the admission 
of black students, of racial integration? Did

10:24.020 --> 10:30.050
anybody oppose it that you recall? I have never 
heard of any opposition, and Mr. Rutter handled

10:30.550 --> 10:38.280
that with great skill. He was a great fraud. Yes, 
sir, he was. Do you remember any anecdotes or

10:44.220 --> 10:49.730
stories about Mr. Rutter that you can share with 
us? Oh,

10:51.130 --> 11:34.260
yes, well, he still is. He still is one of the 
greatest presidents.

11:39.420 --> 11:43.720
I particularly am grateful that he is so 
interested in the library because I share with you

11:43.700 --> 11:47.100
that interest. What caused you to be interested in 
the library?

12:06.780 --> 12:07.461
The Gentiles.

12:10.930 --> 12:11.771
No, sir.

12:15.000 --> 12:16.561
Benjamin Franklin used it. They've grown up here.

12:35.910 --> 12:37.401
Yes. He got the first one. He was the first. He was a 
good one.

12:54.690 --> 12:55.951
John Rutter and I had the group.

13:23.580 --> 13:24.122
We had that.

13:32.840 --> 13:37.080
Who were some of the other faculty members when you 
were a student that had a very positive influence

13:37.060 --> 13:40.780
on you?

14:06.750 --> 14:07.691
Could you do?

14:13.840 --> 14:14.781
Could this guy? He was a good one, too. He worked 
like a dead person.

14:38.590 --> 14:40.071
He traded under him. Damn, that's a good deal. 
That's straight A. Now, what was your major?

14:46.720 --> 14:47.483
Agriculture. Yes. And now, you grew up, you went to 
high school in Uvalde. Why did you go to A&M instead

14:54.340 --> 14:57.840
of some other school? I didn't have to. I didn't 
have to go to that one. Okay. I didn't have to train,

15:03.333 --> 15:20.320
but so

15:03.333 --> 15:20.320
did I go to the training. Did you ever visit A&M 
before you enrolled there? Yes, sir. Let's see who

15:27.028 --> 15:28.000
this is.

15:30.970 --> 15:33.990
Did you visit College Station before you went over 
there to enroll? Yes, sir. How did you get there?

15:36.730 --> 15:38.505
The train. The train, indeed. Did you go on the 
train? The

15:41.220 --> 16:04.787
train. And then you were in College Station how 
long? Was it overnight? Did you spend the night

16:12.510 --> 16:13.791

class? How many?

16:30.030 --> 16:34.670
Now, at Uvalde High School, how many graduated 
when you did? Twenty-one. And about how many went

16:38.668 --> 16:40.530
to college? Did

16:40.510 --> 16:48.600

agriculture when you got there? Was that always

reason that a sophomore would give for whipping a
