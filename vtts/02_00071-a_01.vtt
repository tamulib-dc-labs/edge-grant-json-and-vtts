00:02.107 --> 00:13.189
I have the honor and pleasure of being with Mr. Sterling Evans at his hacienda out at Brackettville, and we're chatting about his recollections.

00:14.311 --> 00:16.616
Mr. Evans, you graduated in 1921.

00:18.520 --> 00:20.143
You were the valedictorian.

00:21.405 --> 00:23.710
When did you learn you were the valedictorian?

00:26.491 --> 00:44.095
How long was your speech?

00:47.380 --> 00:49.042
And it was in Guyon Hall.

00:50.584 --> 00:53.528
Was Guyon Hall new then?

00:54.065 --> 01:13.417
The president was Dr. Bezell.

01:14.879 --> 01:16.562
Was he the president at A&M then?

01:22.060 --> 01:24.363
Do you have any recollections of him?

01:29.810 --> 01:32.253
I'm going up to interview his daughter soon.

01:32.313 --> 01:37.440
She is 95 and living up in Oklahoma City.

01:38.441 --> 01:40.925
So I'm looking forward to interviewing her.

01:42.507 --> 01:43.789
Let's jump forward.

01:45.030 --> 01:51.038
You became active in former student activities in the 1940s.

01:52.182 --> 01:54.045
What led you to become active?

01:54.486 --> 01:56.350
Did someone encourage you to?

02:07.931 --> 02:08.773
What was his name?

02:15.706 --> 02:16.908
All right, we'll get it later.

02:17.769 --> 02:41.325
And what were your first leadership, former student leadership activities?

02:45.760 --> 02:53.888
Yes, sir.

02:53.908 --> 02:54.068
.

02:54.229 --> 02:54.409
.

02:54.429 --> 02:54.449
.

02:54.989 --> 02:55.029
.

02:55.049 --> 02:58.012
.

02:58.152 --> 03:14.569
.

03:15.629 --> 03:25.699
I said, Governor, I do want girls to go left.

03:25.719 --> 03:28.422
But I promise you, you'll appoint me.

03:29.283 --> 03:31.405
Try to do a thing about it.

03:31.425 --> 03:32.346
I said, your governor.

03:32.366 --> 03:33.306
While he's governor.

03:34.147 --> 03:35.929
I said, I was right here.

03:35.949 --> 03:39.613
So, I went ahead and appointed me.

03:39.633 --> 03:42.936
I could have done it with the one next week.

03:43.338 --> 03:47.282
I didn't do it because I promised him.

03:50.846 --> 03:51.427
Anyway, we had to print this.

03:51.447 --> 03:51.827
Senator Moore.

03:52.668 --> 03:53.309
Bill Moore from?

03:54.050 --> 03:54.570
Brown.

03:54.590 --> 03:57.774
Yes, sir.

03:57.794 --> 03:58.074
Senator.

03:58.094 --> 03:59.095
I couldn't approve anybody.

03:59.115 --> 04:00.216
They weren't prepared.

04:00.737 --> 04:05.883
So he wanted to spend it.

04:05.903 --> 04:11.389
Of course, John Brackett, I just wanted to send a thing to that kind of thing.

04:11.409 --> 04:11.809
How about you?

04:14.050 --> 04:38.303
Who were your biggest allies on the board favoring co-education?

04:40.595 --> 04:48.485
and I got it down.

04:51.168 --> 04:56.715
I wouldn't have done today than we did.

04:58.397 --> 04:58.818
I don't know.

04:59.178 --> 05:01.201
They said, why are we guilty?

05:01.221 --> 05:02.282
We just got it down.

05:12.320 --> 05:16.364
Now, John Lindsay was the former student president?

05:18.046 --> 05:18.466
Absolutely.

05:18.486 --> 05:28.356
So the president, he was former president.

05:28.376 --> 05:35.364
Of course, anyway, he got over to John.

05:35.384 --> 05:36.244
And John, he just got to get to John today.

05:36.264 --> 05:36.545
What happened?

05:36.565 --> 05:36.825
I don't know.

05:37.767 --> 06:02.155
And Dick Hervey helped him, didn't he?

06:02.656 --> 06:03.397
I guess he did.

06:04.959 --> 06:06.120
What is a good one?

06:06.809 --> 06:12.176
Now, Mr. Zachary, was he on the board of directors with you then?

06:19.365 --> 06:20.847
He was not for co-education?

06:27.155 --> 06:32.422
And let's see, was Al Davies, was he on the board yet?

06:33.003 --> 06:33.964
Dick Goodson?

06:37.488 --> 07:06.499
Was Mr. Rudder for co-education?

07:07.255 --> 07:15.323
When did you personally start favoring co-education?

07:17.526 --> 07:18.667
Before World War II?

07:18.687 --> 07:20.168
I guess so.

07:20.188 --> 07:30.039
Was there any event or anything that... What about making the Corps voluntary?

07:30.119 --> 07:31.080
Did you favor that?

07:31.360 --> 07:31.440
Yes.

07:32.500 --> 07:38.149
My brother came to it, and we asked for war when it was popular.

07:38.770 --> 07:41.754
I said, boy, there's more to go in.

07:41.774 --> 07:43.036
So he said, we got changed.

07:43.457 --> 07:46.682
We always had a group at that time.

07:46.702 --> 07:49.867
Everybody had a group.

07:49.887 --> 07:51.810
So he came to the board.

07:51.830 --> 07:56.237
He said, we got to make changes.

07:56.257 --> 07:56.658
And I waited for it.

07:56.678 --> 07:58.761
He said, okay, what you want, my favorite.

07:59.213 --> 08:01.957
That's all right.

08:01.977 --> 08:04.340
Anyway, Rutter was a great fellow.

08:04.360 --> 08:04.860
Yes, sir.

08:07.203 --> 08:08.325
Good for you.

08:12.670 --> 08:22.583
Now, you said a while ago, before we turned on the machine, that if you had been on the board when Mr. Rutter was selected, you might not have voted for him.

08:24.105 --> 08:26.588
What do you know about college education?

08:27.243 --> 08:46.946
Who was it, as far as you know, that identified Mr. Rutter to be the new president?

08:50.490 --> 08:55.275
He came in for president.

08:55.880 --> 08:58.343
When did he first come?

08:58.363 --> 08:59.784
1958, I believe.

08:59.864 --> 09:01.105
When did he come?

09:01.125 --> 09:03.428
I believe as executive vice president.

09:06.111 --> 09:08.954
He came before the board.

09:17.482 --> 09:19.324
He had already established himself.

09:19.344 --> 09:19.625
Very quickly.

09:19.645 --> 09:20.065
For a publication.

09:23.167 --> 09:40.343
Now, the fact that he was from the hill country, do you think that helped him any?

09:42.204 --> 09:43.686
No.

09:43.706 --> 09:47.469
Now, he also knew John Connolly well.

09:48.590 --> 09:51.773
And you knew Mr. Connolly well, did you not?

09:53.322 --> 09:55.446
Did that friendship help A&M?

10:02.518 --> 10:05.683
What about connections with President Johnson?

10:05.703 --> 10:14.318
Did he help A&M, LBJ?

10:16.103 --> 10:23.551
Was there ever any discussion about the admission of black students of racial integration?

10:28.275 --> 10:30.097
Did anybody oppose it that you recall?

10:32.219 --> 10:33.801
I have never heard of any opposition.

10:35.583 --> 10:38.306
And Mr. Rudder handled that with great skill.

10:41.749 --> 10:43.731
Yes, sir, he was.

10:45.128 --> 11:10.326
Do you remember any anecdotes or stories about Mr. Rutter that you can share?

11:11.099 --> 11:32.288
John did a great job.

11:32.609 --> 11:33.029
Oh, yes.

11:33.350 --> 11:34.231
Well, he still is.

11:34.331 --> 11:35.753
Still is.

11:35.773 --> 11:38.457
One of the greatest friends in the university.

11:39.179 --> 11:47.147
I particularly am grateful that he is so interested in the library because I share with you that interest.

11:48.288 --> 11:51.131
What caused you to be interested in the library?

11:54.374 --> 12:06.046
When I went to school, Tommy Mayo, the library, the good one, the color, the service.

12:06.066 --> 12:08.629
You know, we're not the gentles of society.

12:09.233 --> 12:11.816
No, sir.

12:28.134 --> 12:36.523
Yes.

12:36.976 --> 12:53.313
He got the first ... There weren't something else he was the first, but he was a good man.

12:54.834 --> 12:58.518
You know what I mean?

12:58.538 --> 13:04.384
We got the ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ...

13:05.950 --> 13:10.518
He had the paper sometimes.

13:12.261 --> 13:18.232
So he had the paper.

13:18.252 --> 13:20.656
He was going to talk about it.

13:21.778 --> 13:28.009
He was a great person.

13:32.967 --> 13:40.737
Who were some of the other faculty members when you were a student that had a very positive influence on you?

13:40.757 --> 13:59.481
.

14:03.460 --> 14:07.725
I remember, I prayed, what could you do?

14:12.151 --> 14:12.972
Don't go outside.

14:13.793 --> 14:14.895
I got to be good at his class.

14:17.278 --> 14:21.002
He was a good one, too.

14:21.022 --> 14:23.005
I worked like a different person.

14:36.147 --> 14:45.202
And what was your major?

14:46.565 --> 14:46.805
Agriculture.

14:46.825 --> 14:47.506
Agriculture.

14:48.768 --> 14:53.156
And now you grew up, you went to high school in Uvalde.

14:54.358 --> 14:57.823
Why did you go to A&M instead of some other school?

15:00.788 --> 15:01.750
OK.

15:03.198 --> 15:08.145
I couldn't have to put my soldiers out in the training.

15:08.165 --> 15:19.242
I went to A&M.

15:19.262 --> 15:19.923
I got to the University of Texas.

15:19.943 --> 15:20.924
I enjoyed that.

15:20.944 --> 15:24.770
Did you ever visit A&M before you enrolled there?

15:26.813 --> 15:26.993
Yes, sir.

15:27.013 --> 15:28.075
Let's see who this is.

15:30.907 --> 15:35.092
Did you visit College Station before you went over there to enroll?

15:35.112 --> 15:35.873
Yes, sir.

15:35.893 --> 15:36.735
How did you get there?

15:38.357 --> 15:40.199
In grade 18.

15:40.219 --> 15:41.180
Did you go on the train?

15:52.275 --> 15:52.475
Train.

15:56.741 --> 15:57.121
I stayed all night.

15:57.141 --> 15:57.542
I went to the train.

15:57.562 --> 15:58.343
I went over to the port of the station.

15:58.363 --> 15:58.703
I had to do that.

15:58.723 --> 15:59.344
Three or four hours.

16:00.505 --> 16:07.955
And then you were in College Station how long?

16:09.538 --> 16:10.379
Was it overnight?

16:12.562 --> 16:13.743
Did you spend the night there?

16:16.627 --> 16:19.051
How many in your high school graduating class?

16:21.715 --> 16:22.075
How many?

16:29.969 --> 16:34.593
Now, at Uvalde High School, how many graduated when you did?

16:34.613 --> 16:34.673
21.

16:37.136 --> 16:37.696
21.

16:38.637 --> 16:40.439
And about how many went to college?

16:44.223 --> 16:44.443
I remember.

16:44.463 --> 16:48.547
Did you know that you were going to major in agriculture when you got there?

16:49.467 --> 16:50.869
Was that always your major?

16:57.155 --> 16:57.575
Yes, sir.

16:57.915 --> 16:59.537
Yes, sir.

17:00.462 --> 17:12.158
In what dormitory did you live when you got to A&M?

17:12.378 --> 17:20.069
B1.

17:20.610 --> 17:20.970
B1?

17:20.990 --> 17:23.694
All right.

17:23.714 --> 17:29.642
And can you share with me any of, do you recall any of the

17:30.787 --> 17:34.732
Fish, freshman hazing.

17:35.513 --> 17:37.575
What did the sophomores do to freshmen then?

17:39.057 --> 17:48.388
There was never a lot of them.

17:48.409 --> 17:56.759
I remember football, basketball, basketball.

17:56.779 --> 17:57.840
We had a fellow.

17:58.951 --> 18:02.636
couldn't keep up with anybody.

18:02.656 --> 18:08.303
Nobody said, you stand, you're sick today.

18:08.323 --> 18:14.831
If you're sick or not, you're going to stay there.

18:14.851 --> 18:16.413
So he stayed in the room.

18:16.433 --> 18:23.862
There was one flag with the parking team that has the flag they gave us.

18:23.882 --> 18:25.144
Anyway, that's the parking team.

18:26.288 --> 18:28.030
All right.

18:28.511 --> 18:31.215
You said that they beat you some.

18:32.376 --> 18:37.724
What would be the reason that a sophomore would give for whipping a freshman?

18:40.828 --> 18:41.348
Just did it?

18:43.772 --> 18:45.594
Was it normally after supper?

18:46.976 --> 18:48.398
I remember about that.

18:50.555 --> 18:56.363
And you all ate in Cebiza.

18:57.705 --> 18:59.988
Describe a typical meal.

19:00.128 --> 19:01.610
How was it served?

19:01.991 --> 19:18.013
Where did you all sit?

19:19.073 --> 19:21.015
Okay, very good.

19:21.095 --> 19:22.757
Was Mr. Sebesa still living?

19:23.078 --> 19:24.139
I remember.

19:24.159 --> 19:25.441
Describe him, please.

19:25.941 --> 19:26.282
I don't remember.

19:26.302 --> 19:27.143
Oh, you don't remember.

19:27.743 --> 19:28.825
Oh.

19:29.065 --> 19:30.406
You say the food was good.

19:31.968 --> 19:34.011
What was your favorite Aggie food?

19:38.196 --> 19:41.159
Anything that you could eat, I guess.

19:41.179 --> 19:43.482
You went in September.

19:44.203 --> 19:45.645
When did you come home?

19:46.886 --> 19:48.608
Did you come home for Thanksgiving?

19:51.592 --> 19:54.536
But you didn't go to Houston or Dallas?

19:54.556 --> 19:55.097
Football games.

20:01.746 --> 20:04.811
Did they make court trips then for football games?

20:06.673 --> 20:07.334
To Waco.

20:07.354 --> 20:07.915
To Waco.

20:08.736 --> 20:09.497
And you went on the train?

20:09.517 --> 20:09.898
Train.

20:11.360 --> 20:12.482
Did you spend the night?

20:16.688 --> 20:17.008
I remember that.

20:18.727 --> 20:23.753
When you when you went on the train, did you all get into any mischief?

20:27.959 --> 20:28.699
Probably did.

20:31.203 --> 20:32.684
Tell me about your roommates.

20:33.566 --> 20:47.603
Who was your roommate?

20:48.477 --> 20:49.278
Chemistry major?

20:56.787 --> 20:58.509
Jack Mahan.

21:00.452 --> 21:01.213
Where was he from?

21:08.562 --> 21:09.163
Above Dallas.

21:10.124 --> 21:13.388
Let's see, was Mr. Zachary one of your classmates?

21:15.275 --> 21:16.237
Year after you.

21:17.018 --> 21:23.949
And Harrington also described them as students.

21:25.031 --> 21:26.193
Were they good students?

21:28.036 --> 21:28.477
Zachary?

21:29.158 --> 21:30.500
Was he an engineering major?

21:33.285 --> 21:38.614
What about Mr. Harrington?

21:38.634 --> 21:39.074
I don't remember.

21:41.418 --> 21:41.599
Whatever.

21:41.619 --> 21:41.719
Good.

21:41.739 --> 21:41.839
Good.

21:43.152 --> 21:48.839
Now, one of my favorite Aggie acquaintances was Buck Shewitz.

21:51.482 --> 21:53.545
Tell me about your memory of him.

21:54.486 --> 21:57.850
Buck Shewitz was a great fellow.

21:57.870 --> 22:00.834
I wanted to go and study his little yard.

22:01.915 --> 22:06.520
Father said, hey, no, it's going to buy a bunch of the yard.

22:06.540 --> 22:11.927
So I'll study it and get that library.

22:16.210 --> 22:21.970
So, they had a lot of go to L.A.M.

22:21.990 --> 22:22.090
that.

22:22.110 --> 22:22.853
Took classes.

22:22.873 --> 22:25.662
They'd give a doctor one-on-one with you.

22:25.682 --> 22:27.047
You can't do it enough, sure.

22:43.312 --> 22:50.202
Now, I noticed in the Longhorn, the yearbook, that Buck was the art editor.

22:51.443 --> 22:51.624
Yes, sir.

22:51.644 --> 22:55.048
Did you students think that Buck was a kind of a character?

22:55.389 --> 22:56.010
You're darn right.

22:56.831 --> 22:58.093
He was a character.

22:58.113 --> 23:00.075
What kind of goofy things did he do?

23:04.702 --> 23:05.343
I don't remember.

23:07.245 --> 23:07.846
Anything that he wanted to do.

23:07.866 --> 23:08.407
He was a very good student.

23:08.427 --> 23:08.908
He was?

23:08.968 --> 23:09.268
Yes.

23:11.510 --> 23:13.993
Did he get into mischief?

23:30.995 --> 23:33.438
Now, did you become a collector of Shewitz art?

23:36.703 --> 23:40.808
I know John Lindsay has a fine... Yes, sir.

23:42.442 --> 23:47.791
Now, tell me when you get tired and we need to quit this.

23:49.914 --> 23:50.295
OK.

23:53.360 --> 23:53.781
Let's see.

23:56.525 --> 24:04.679
What was some of your favorite courses that you took while you were a student?

24:04.699 --> 24:07.183
A lot of them were good ones.

24:12.158 --> 24:19.169
I'd recommend one, do good.

24:20.451 --> 24:34.913
I decided I'd make good classes, good in this class.

24:39.921 --> 24:40.782
I would, I'd, I'd, I'd, I'd, I'd, I'd, I'd,

24:41.740 --> 24:49.769
Did you all do some field work then in agriculture?

24:50.891 --> 24:55.596
Where were the field on the west campus?

24:57.678 --> 24:58.760
What did you all grow?

24:58.900 --> 25:00.402
Cotton, corn, what else?

25:02.284 --> 25:02.804
Vegetables.

25:03.445 --> 25:04.586
What kind of vegetables?

25:09.592 --> 25:10.073
Turnips.

25:10.153 --> 25:10.313
Turnips.

25:11.643 --> 25:12.084
Spinach.

25:12.104 --> 25:16.290
I don't remember.

25:16.310 --> 25:18.173
Any tomatoes or lettuce or?

25:18.193 --> 25:22.259
I guess we did.

25:22.279 --> 25:22.519
Good course.

25:23.020 --> 25:30.812
When you were taking those courses, what kind of agriculture did you dream that you were going to practice?

25:32.775 --> 25:34.197
Did you think you were going to be a rancher?

25:34.217 --> 25:39.926
I guess I would be able to get those things.

25:39.946 --> 25:40.266
That's my dream.

25:42.794 --> 25:43.235
Yes, sir.

25:48.482 --> 25:57.355
Can you recall any of the pranks that you and your friends pulled off while you were students?

26:00.119 --> 26:01.161
I guess we did.

26:04.125 --> 26:05.627
I don't remember.

26:05.647 --> 26:10.414
Did you fill anybody's room with water or trash?

26:10.475 --> 26:12.177
Yeah, I did.

26:17.962 --> 26:31.399
Did you ever put an animal in anybody's room?

26:32.180 --> 26:32.761
Didn't do that?

26:33.121 --> 26:46.618
Because I've heard of some putting a heifer in somebody's room overnight, or a hog or something.

26:49.012 --> 26:52.136
I remember going back to Goodboro.

26:52.156 --> 26:54.479
Is it still Goodboro?

26:54.499 --> 26:55.079
No, sir.

26:55.119 --> 26:56.381
I don't believe it's there anymore.

26:56.821 --> 26:57.883
I believe it's been leveled.

26:58.543 --> 27:02.668
But it was one of the dorms where you lived?

27:07.474 --> 27:15.183
I remember going out on my leg.

27:15.203 --> 27:18.327
I remember doing that.

27:19.522 --> 27:38.768
Now, where was the post office then?

27:41.072 --> 27:44.917
At Northgate near Subisa?

27:46.018 --> 27:48.702
How often did you get mail from home?

27:51.550 --> 27:54.032
Did you write a letter home regularly?

27:56.635 --> 27:59.958
Now, how did your family pay for you to go to A&M?

28:17.293 --> 28:20.056
$420 off of an acre?

28:21.077 --> 28:21.557
Wow.

28:23.005 --> 28:49.468
How often did you all hear news about the war in Europe?

28:52.537 --> 29:13.772
Going into the war.

29:13.792 --> 29:14.113
I took his head.

29:14.133 --> 29:14.313
Remember?

29:14.333 --> 29:14.674
There's a hatbox.

29:14.694 --> 29:15.375
I got her just... I got this card.

29:15.395 --> 29:15.996
She said, oh, it's over there.

29:18.507 --> 29:24.695
Because now, we got into the war at almost the same time you started as a student.

29:28.721 --> 29:36.531
While the war was going on, did any of your close friends go to Europe and serve in the Army?

29:42.679 --> 29:42.980
No, I remember.

29:43.000 --> 29:43.300
No, I remember.

29:46.638 --> 29:50.001
What did you and your friends do when you heard the war was over?

29:51.403 --> 29:51.603
Celebrate.

29:51.623 --> 29:52.664
How did you celebrate?

30:05.117 --> 30:06.418
You celebrated by doing what?

30:09.762 --> 30:10.122
To Brian, I guess.

30:10.142 --> 30:10.823
Oh, to Brian.

30:11.512 --> 30:18.220
Where in Bryan did you, what was the name of, do you remember where in Bryan Aggies would celebrate?

30:20.523 --> 30:21.624
No, I don't remember.

30:21.644 --> 30:24.908
Now, did those celebrations ever involve alcohol?

30:28.032 --> 30:28.853
No, I didn't know anything about alcohol.

30:28.873 --> 30:29.333
Not even beer?

30:29.353 --> 30:29.634
Not even beer.

30:31.076 --> 30:39.546
Was there a... I don't remember.

30:39.566 --> 30:40.607
And...

30:41.043 --> 30:47.210
When you all were looking for a date, where did the young ladies live that you all dated?

30:52.016 --> 30:55.540
How often did girlfriends come to College Station?

31:00.306 --> 31:01.587
And they would come on the train?

31:02.889 --> 31:03.770
And you all met them?

31:04.891 --> 31:08.215
Where did they spend the night?

31:11.435 --> 31:25.814
That would be faculty, and did they charge anything for the girls to... Did you have a favorite faculty member that you... Who was it?

31:37.769 --> 31:38.370
I remember that.

31:39.110 --> 31:42.182
Did you all celebrate silver taps then?

31:42.223 --> 31:45.174
Yes, we did.

31:45.255 --> 31:45.576
Where was it?
