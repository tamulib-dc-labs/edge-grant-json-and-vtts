00:03.693 --> 00:15.231
A couple of things which occurred while you were a 
student that had been of some interest to us and

00:03.693 --> 00:15.231
wondered what you might be able to tell us about it, 
which I guess was your freshman year. There were

00:15.952 --> 00:17.614
two incidents of some interest. One was the 
incident involving the rice owl. Yeah. And the

00:23.644 --> 00:25.507
other, the branding of Bevo. Do you have any 
recollection of those two? No, I have a very...

00:31.250 --> 00:58.405
strong recollection of the Rice Owl episode, not 
that I was involved in it, but one of the football

00:31.250 --> 00:58.405
players who roomed right across the hall from me 
when I was a freshman was wakened, and these boys

00:31.250 --> 00:58.405
from Rice came up and,

00:31.250 --> 00:58.405
well, we had stolen the owl down there and brought 
it up here, and they I believe there were two cars

00:59.077 --> 01:00.959
up. I remember I mentioned maybe just one car. And 
they drove up here and got the owl. And could have

01:06.985 --> 01:14.373
gotten away, but in their exuberance before they 
left the campus, they hollered and woke everybody

01:06.985 --> 01:14.373
up. So the posse formed. There was a train that came 
through here at, oh, 4.30 or something like that in

01:17.016 --> 01:22.221
the morning. And they rushed down there, 15 or 20 of 
them, and got on that train and went to Navasota.

01:28.102 --> 01:37.474
and blocked the road, which in those days wasn't 
too hard, just a dirt road, and captured them and

01:28.102 --> 01:37.474
brought them back up here. And I can remember at

01:39.036 --> 01:57.720
noon the next day on the steps of Speza Hall, Dr. 
Brazell and the leaders in this posse were there on

01:39.036 --> 01:57.720
the steps, and they had these rice boys. They were 
all, I don't remember, were they handcuffed or

01:58.460 --> 02:01.463
whatnot? Anyhow, they had them captured.

02:05.447 --> 02:10.553
They had, among them was a, I believe, a private 
detective from Houston. They had probably hired

02:10.613 --> 02:13.196
to help them. And they let all the boys go the next 
day, I think, but this private detective, he kept

02:13.216 --> 02:19.563
for a week. The room wouldn't let him out.

02:23.887 --> 02:27.831
The branding of Bevo, I didn't know a thing about. I 
was just I knew about the incident. They were all

02:31.501 --> 02:37.750
upperclassmen, and there were pictures in the 
paper about it. Back to the Rice Owl incident. What

02:42.596 --> 02:46.621
did they do to this detective that they kept 
confined? I don't remember anything he did except

02:46.841 --> 02:53.991
just kept him in a room locked up.

02:54.111 --> 02:55.813
But then presumably finally let him go. Oh, yeah, 
they let him go. There again, I think the spirit of

02:58.366 --> 03:08.416
that kind of thing in those days was a little more 
carefree. Nobody was mad at anybody.

03:14.483 --> 03:15.544
Nobody got hurt.

03:19.428 --> 03:24.253
I think the university people, when they branded 
the steer, they applauded. They thought that was a

03:24.293 --> 03:27.276
pretty good trick.

03:28.555 --> 03:42.670
One thing in connection with the branding of Bevo 
that we've been trying to track down, we have a

03:28.555 --> 03:42.670
couple of pictures of the steer with the 13 to 0 
brand on it.

03:46.274 --> 03:52.921
In view of your leadership position among the 
student body during your senior year, I want to ask

03:46.274 --> 03:52.921
you this. One of those pictures has a clipping on 
the back of it Well, one

03:58.795 --> 04:11.428
of the pictures, and we also have an invitation to a 
banquet, which we feel occurred in January of

03:58.795 --> 04:11.428
1920, which would have been your senior year. 
Indications are that this steer was slaughtered,

04:12.129 --> 04:24.162
and they had a banquet in Austin, to which people 
from the athletic department at A&M and the

04:12.129 --> 04:24.162
administration at A&M were invited. And the meal 
was Bevo. Yeah. Do you have any recollection of

04:29.717 --> 04:31.059
that? Oh, I don't. I sure don't. And one of the 
articles that's pasted to the back of one of the

04:33.482 --> 04:47.218
pictures indicates that the hide of the animal was 
skinned, I mean was cured, and each school got a

04:33.482 --> 04:47.218
half of it. I don't know. You don't have any? I don't 
have any recollection of that. Uh-huh. Well, I was

04:51.395 --> 05:03.010
wondering in view of the fact that, you know, your 
position on campus and then your position with the

04:51.395 --> 05:03.010
Association of Former Students, we can't find any 
other evidence that A&M ever had half the height of

04:51.395 --> 05:03.010
Bevo. I don't remember anything about it. I sure 
don't. The other, one other thing involving Bevo

05:07.636 --> 05:19.191
was that, you know, the story has long been told 
that this 13 to 0 brand was changed to read Bevo.

05:21.432 --> 05:24.458
and that this is how the animal got its name.

05:27.644 --> 05:28.285
Well, I don't know. I never had heard that. I would 
doubt it. I don't know. I think the steer's name was

05:33.515 --> 05:38.564
Beevil when they branded it, wasn't it? Well, this 
is one thing we have never really been able to

05:39.165 --> 05:42.191
figure out. There is some... indication 
somewhere that we picked up that the animal's name

05:45.412 --> 05:51.481
was Bevo before the branding. That's what I 
thought. Some people have indicated that they

05:52.743 --> 06:05.322
thought that the 13-0 was converted to 13 to a B and 
the dash into an E and a V was stuck in and the zero

05:52.743 --> 06:05.322
became the O of Bevo. We've been told Bevo was a 
rather popular non-alcoholic drink that was

06:05.943 --> 06:10.711
served on campus. An imitation beer. Now, was Bevo 
sold in College Station or brand also? I don't

06:19.283 --> 06:19.764
know. I imagine it was. I don't know whether it was 
just a general term for all imitation

06:22.928 --> 06:32.080
beer or not. Or whether it was a particular brand 
that might have been popular in Austin. Yeah, I

06:35.184 --> 06:35.724
don't know. I hadn't thought about it. Well, it's 
one of those things that we still need to do some

06:39.243 --> 06:42.832
work on, I think. But we've been asking about as 
many people as we can find who are around at that

06:42.872 --> 06:52.375
point to see what they may know about it.

06:55.510 --> 06:59.656
Let's see, I believe you played basketball for all 
four years that you were here. Well, yeah, four

06:59.676 --> 07:00.617
years. You played freshman basketball and three 
years of varsity. And then you were captain of the

07:03.301 --> 07:09.410
championship team in 1920. What

07:09.490 --> 07:20.186
was collegiate basketball like in the teens and 
20s? Oh, it was more a wrestling match. It wasn't

07:23.211 --> 07:24.893
anything like today's games. Of course, the 
players today are so much more skillful and so much

07:26.071 --> 07:33.681
bigger. We had a boy on our team, Tiny Keene, who was 
about six feet four, and he was a curiosity around

07:34.842 --> 07:44.615
the league. I mean, we called him the Giant. Nobody 
had ever seen a basketball player that tall

07:46.818 --> 07:49.782
before. He wasn't too good, but... It wasn't until 
later years that these giants started coming

07:54.522 --> 07:59.349
along. And, of course, they changed the game up. 
But I would guess from what you said, being more of a

08:03.715 --> 08:12.167
wrestling match than anything, than today's 
game, that there was less calling of fouls. Oh,

08:12.407 --> 08:16.853
yeah.

08:16.873 --> 08:21.660
I believe all four years I played, you designated 
one foul shooter. He shot all the fouls for your

08:22.012 --> 08:23.856
team. Of course, you always picked out the one that 
could shoot them the best. Uh-huh. And my

08:27.563 --> 08:34.115
recollection is he might go try six or seven, 
eight, or ten fouls a game. That'd be about all of

08:34.135 --> 08:35.478
those. Nowadays, 50, 60. 50 in the game. Yeah. And 
that's about more than one a minute in the game.

08:42.872 --> 08:42.972
Yeah. Yeah. So someone has told us that the man who 
had the ball was kind of fair game. He was fair game.

08:51.751 --> 08:52.893
Everybody was after him. He could do almost 
anything within reason to get the ball. He

08:56.738 --> 09:03.967
couldn't grab hold of them, but as far as blocking 
away the elbows and knees and hips, well, that was

08:56.738 --> 09:03.967
all right. He could do that. And I believe you ran 
track, I believe, as a freshman. I tried to run

09:09.534 --> 09:12.258
track, but I wasn't very successful. What was your 
specialty in that? Half mile. Half mile. Yeah.

09:18.006 --> 09:20.129
And let's see.

09:23.634 --> 09:29.142
I believe in your senior year, you were a second 
lieutenant in the Ross Volunteers. Could you tell

09:31.405 --> 09:34.830
us a little bit about that organization How did you 
become a member of the RV, and then how were the

09:36.194 --> 09:41.422
officers chosen? Well, it was pretty much a social 
organization.

09:46.971 --> 09:53.360
Well, practically altogether a social 
organization, and you had to be elected to

09:46.971 --> 09:53.360
membership by the organization.

09:57.286 --> 09:59.370
I don't think we did any drilling. I don't remember 
any drilling. I think we had RV uniforms all right.

10:03.356 --> 10:04.918
I guess we could stand up in a line. but as far as 
appearing at public affairs, I don't remember any

10:05.472 --> 10:10.622
at all. We had a big R.B. dance every spring, which 
was one of the big college dances,

10:12.786 --> 10:26.873
and I think we wore our uniforms then, but as far as 
appearing at governors and inaugurals, Mardi

10:29.266 --> 10:31.248
Gras, things of that sort. But was it still billed 
as a crack drill team? No, I don't think so. It seems

10:37.575 --> 10:42.700
to me earlier when they first started that they... 
Well, I expect earlier days they did. Then it kind

10:44.522 --> 10:46.504
of went down, I guess.

10:49.527 --> 10:56.495
And finally, the military department pretty well 
took it over, which they have now, just my

10:49.527 --> 10:56.495
understanding of it. And it's no longer... But it 
was sort of, it operated like a fraternity in those

11:00.755 --> 11:08.385
earlier days, let's say. If you weren't well 
liked, you didn't get elected to the RVs. No matter

11:12.190 --> 11:13.992
how good you were at drilling. And

11:14.293 --> 11:21.362
then were the officers, Say you were a second 
lieutenant. Was that an appointment by somebody

11:23.965 --> 11:28.651
else? I think it was elected. I think it was elected 
officers. Well, that's somewhat maybe of a

11:33.518 --> 11:46.937
carryover of the earlier military tradition, and 
I know almost all of the companies organized in the

11:33.518 --> 11:46.937
Civil War elected their own officers. It was more 
like a fraternity than anything else, I guess, as

11:46.957 --> 11:51.163
far as... election was concerned and the 
membership was concerned.

11:59.147 --> 12:06.715
Membership was highly regarded, but I think more 
as a social recognition than anything else.

12:11.741 --> 12:17.527
Your senior Longhorn indicated you were also a 
member of the Junto Society. Could you tell us a

12:17.908 --> 12:20.070
little bit about that organization? Well, that 
was Tommy Mayo was responsible for that, I think.

12:25.784 --> 12:39.360
And it was just a group of students and a few faculty 
members who were interested in discussions

12:25.784 --> 12:39.360
of one kind or another. And I

12:39.380 --> 12:44.927
was one of the original members. We pondered a long 
time on a name, and finally, I believe Tommy May

12:46.460 --> 12:56.873
will come up with Junto, which I think he said in 
Spanish means a gathering. And we would meet

12:58.215 --> 13:15.437
sometimes at these professors' houses, 
sometimes in a room somewhere, and each member had

12:58.215 --> 13:15.437
to deliver a paper every year, sometime during the 
year, and he could select his topics. So it would

13:16.210 --> 13:18.253
have been a pretty limited membership then. Oh, 
I'd say a dozen maybe at most. In order to get around

13:21.578 --> 13:24.382
to everybody in a reasonable number of meetings. 
Yeah, but that was Mayo and we had a man in the

13:24.742 --> 13:36.780
English department named Thomas, Bill Thomas, 
who was also involved in it. Miss Thomas used to be

13:37.040 --> 13:43.129
in the library for a long time after he died.

13:45.927 --> 13:58.964
And we had a character in the architecture 
department named Gilbert Geist, who was

13:45.927 --> 13:58.964
instrumental in it. It was just a nice, it was a nice 
activity as far as, for people who were interested

13:58.984 --> 14:04.391
in that kind of thing. So then did you have a, 
someone each meeting gave a paper and then did you

14:04.411 --> 14:11.641
discuss the paper or? Yeah, yeah. Discussed the 
topic. Mm-hmm. So almost everybody had to do a

14:15.290 --> 14:17.493
little preparation. Everybody had to do some 
work. You knew in advance what the subject of the

14:18.454 --> 14:21.799
paper was to be, I take it. I think so, yeah.

14:29.369 --> 14:32.754
And let's see, I believe you were also associate 
editor to the battalion. That didn't mean

14:33.795 --> 14:34.636
anything. It didn't mean anything. It didn't mean 
anything. I don't remember work. I just don't

14:37.841 --> 14:42.327
remember what I did or anything on the battalion. 
Well, generally the associate's supposed to help

14:42.779 --> 14:48.464
the

14:42.779 --> 14:48.464
editor. That's right. But I guess if an editor 
works it right, he passes all the work on to

14:48.765 --> 14:54.130
somebody else. He's a good executive. And if he 
does that, then the associate really doesn't have

14:55.391 --> 14:59.715
that much to do.

15:03.298 --> 15:03.659
Okay.

15:08.704 --> 15:12.347
How is it that you happen to pick animal husbandry 
as a made your field. I don't know, to tell you the

15:14.128 --> 15:16.951
truth. I had no agricultural background. Your 
father was a railroad man. That's right. I worked

15:22.556 --> 15:33.007
on a farm one summer, but I guess it's sort of 
romantic, you know, cowboy life, one thing or

15:22.556 --> 15:33.007
another. Why I did, I don't really know. Probably 
you didn't have that field chosen before you came

15:37.131 --> 15:41.676
here, I would imagine. Well, I guess I did. I knew 
what I was going to take. As I say, I probably took it

15:44.755 --> 15:47.458
because I didn't have to have any math. Uh-huh. 
Animal husbandry. I was wondering whether maybe

15:50.382 --> 15:56.970
after you'd been here a year or two, you 
encountered a faculty member in that department.

15:57.711 --> 16:00.234
You mentioned John Burns, I guess, was head of the 
department. No, I never did. I don't recall any

16:01.776 --> 16:05.561
doubts about changing. I couldn't have changed to 
engineering. I couldn't do engineering. I

16:08.785 --> 16:09.726
couldn't do math. And, uh, Of course, that was 
pretty much all they had in those days, in

16:11.609 --> 16:15.835
agriculture and engineering.

16:22.083 --> 16:30.113
Well, then you mentioned sometime during the 
spring of your senior year, Dr. Mayo suggested

16:22.083 --> 16:30.113
perhaps you go to... Mizzell. Mizzell, I mean. 
Mizzell suggested that you get a master's and then

16:31.054 --> 16:36.722
come back here and teach, which you did for one 
year. And you did teach animal husbandry at that

16:37.583 --> 16:40.587
point. Yeah. And then you went to Dallas, I believe 
you said, and you were in the insurance business.

16:47.983 --> 16:52.427
What type of insurance business were you in? Life 
insurance. Life insurance. Hated every minute of

16:54.289 --> 16:55.730
it. Well, I've been told by a life insurance agent 
at one point that trying to sell life insurance in

16:55.750 --> 17:05.378
the days before Social Security was really kind of 
a losing proposition. Nobody wanted it. I just

17:07.560 --> 17:09.022
didn't like it at all. I made a living in it. I was 
delighted to come back here. You say you were

17:16.087 --> 17:18.430
delighted to come back. Was the offer made to you? 
Yeah. Someone from here approached you to come

17:20.673 --> 17:25.439
back into the- Well, I knew Colonel Ashburn from my 
days in school. What was his position in the

17:26.701 --> 17:30.386
university or in the college? Well, when he first 
came down here, he was a publicity officer for the

17:30.546 --> 17:38.136
college. Information officer, we call him now. 
Then I believe he moved from that into Secretary of

17:42.920 --> 17:47.848
the Former Student Association. Uh-huh. 
Somewhere along the line, he was Commandant at one

17:48.028 --> 17:50.833
point, I believe. I guess he was Commandant before 
he went at the Former Student Association. Yeah.

17:56.602 --> 17:59.747
And then you came here in... Fall of 25. Fall of 25 as 
an assistant to Ashburn. Yeah. He left then in the

18:05.256 --> 18:07.280
spring of 26. I succeeded him. What were your... 
principal duties as an assistant to him? Well, I

18:15.203 --> 18:22.392
helped edit the Texas Aggie, which in those days 
was a newspaper. Yeah. And did anything else. Of

18:27.839 --> 18:31.804
course, the program was much smaller in those days 
than it is now. Not nearly as many alumni. He did the

18:33.847 --> 18:35.469
traveling. I didn't do much traveling.

18:39.822 --> 18:43.946
He went on, he transferred then, I believe, to the 
information office. Seems somewhere, I believe,

18:45.487 --> 18:48.510
I indicated. I'm not sure about the sequence 
there. He came, he was information officer. Oh,

18:53.315 --> 18:53.775
okay. Well, maybe I'm thinking something else. 
Then the war came along, and he was a highly

18:56.078 --> 19:00.702
decorated hero in the war. And then I believe he was 
commandant. And then he was former student

19:05.947 --> 19:08.850
secretary. He left here. His wife died then. And he 
left here to go to Houston, I believe, as head of the

19:12.730 --> 19:17.039
Chamber of Commerce. Oh, okay. And I believe 
somewhere I picked up that you taught in the

19:18.923 --> 19:23.132
history department for a couple years. Oh, one 
year. I was just, I was moonlighting. You were? I

19:28.068 --> 19:30.611
guess that was the year I came down here. The first 
year you were with the Association of Former

19:30.631 --> 19:33.634
Students. What courses did you teach? Medieval 
Europe. Medieval history. Had you had any courses

19:39.961 --> 19:41.362
in that? Yes, I had. I always liked history. I liked 
teaching history. But that was something you

19:48.630 --> 19:51.152
filled in. I filled in. And then I do have one 
teaching distinction, I taught the first course

19:58.088 --> 20:02.977
in genetics offered here. Was that when you first? 
That was that year I came back here. In 21-22?

20:09.970 --> 20:10.190
21-22. I had had a course in genetics. I never had 
heard of genetics. I had a course in genetics at

20:15.881 --> 20:18.325
Wisconsin. And Dean Kyle called me up one day and 
said, didn't you have a course in genetics at

20:19.503 --> 20:24.928
Wisconsin? I said, yeah. He said, you're going to 
teach a course next term.

20:33.896 --> 20:44.626
OK. Then in 27, I believe it was, you became 
executive director of the Association of Former

20:33.896 --> 20:44.626
Students following that. 26, I believe. 26, yeah.

20:50.418 --> 20:53.121
What size of an operation was that at that point? I 
mean, you were an executive director. How many

20:55.463 --> 20:57.004
people did you have working under you? Well, I had 
one man and one girl, I think. Just one, I believe.

21:04.512 --> 21:07.255
Then we just gradually grew. We never did have over 
five when I was five or six.

21:20.557 --> 21:22.339
We didn't have much money nowadays. They got 
plenty of money. They're just doing fine over

21:23.420 --> 21:25.462
there. Well, I don't think they'll ever admit that 
they have plenty. Well, no, I'm sure of that. They

21:30.488 --> 21:39.237
have substantial sums, anyway.

21:40.398 --> 21:50.209
I read a newspaper clipping that was in your 
biographical file, and they mentioned a number of

21:40.398 --> 21:50.209
things that were inaugurated while you were uh, 
executive secretary. And I thought I might talk

21:53.070 --> 21:59.858
with you about those a little bit, see what you 
have, uh, your recollections are about them. One

21:59.978 --> 22:07.267
of the things, uh, that was done while you were 
executive secretary was the organization of the

21:59.978 --> 22:07.267
placement office. Yeah. Can you tell us a little 
bit about the background as to how that came into

22:08.348 --> 22:12.433
being? And I mean, I take it there was no placement 
service. There was no placement services. I

22:18.520 --> 22:19.842
don't, uh, I just remember promoting the idea and I 
think we financed, the former students financed

22:20.480 --> 22:37.847
the first year of it and I hired the first director 
and later along the line the college took it over

22:20.480 --> 22:37.847
and became quite a good size office. I believe 
ultimately they kind of developed two placement

22:39.515 --> 22:44.462
offices, one in education and one for everybody 
else. Yeah, that's the latest development. Well,

22:46.105 --> 22:47.507
I believe they're merging those. Are they? I 
believe next year they're supposed to be all under

22:48.268 --> 22:51.173
one. All under one, yeah. I believe they had a 
placement office in teacher placement. They've

22:56.701 --> 22:59.165
had the two, and I believe now that's all going to be 
in one. Well, through the years, and particularly

23:00.927 --> 23:04.813
in those days...

23:06.953 --> 23:14.825
The former students were always ahead of the 
college in their thinking and dreaming. We had a

23:14.845 --> 23:24.078
succession of presidents who were not 
particularly interested in branching out on that

23:14.845 --> 23:24.078
thing. And we were always promoting them to do 
something, like the placement office. I think we

23:27.423 --> 23:28.685
promoted that. And we promoted the archives 
office. I don't remember. I believe we financed

23:34.819 --> 23:36.061
that. I believe the former students financed that 
for a year or two. Yeah, I believe for maybe as much

23:38.524 --> 23:43.191
as three, at least in part. And then the university 
put up some money. And I believe the former

23:45.694 --> 23:55.067
students, let's see, financed the first three 
years pretty heavily. And then the fourth year,

23:55.087 --> 23:57.691
another amount. And I've not been able to track 
down what's come since then. Well, I don't

24:02.457 --> 24:03.859
remember either. I remember we were always 
proposing items, and it was Grassley who got them

24:04.328 --> 24:10.978
over. And I guess I would have to say, in addition to 
proposing items, you were kind of putting your

24:11.218 --> 24:18.189
money where your mouth was, too. Well, you had to 
get them started. You had to get them started

24:20.111 --> 24:24.238
financially as well as idea-wise. And the 
university, the school finally took them over

24:24.898 --> 24:27.803
then. I

24:28.664 --> 24:34.032
know that That said, before the placement office 
was organized, I know that recruiters came to the

24:34.248 --> 24:42.519
campus to interview people. Who did they get in 
touch with? I guess they just went to the

24:46.264 --> 24:51.071
department head, as far as I know. The placement 
office then would simplify matters. Simplify

24:54.375 --> 24:57.800
matters, give them a place to start from. And would 
also give the students a place to go to.

25:04.994 --> 25:14.546
I believe you also were involved in starting the 
annual giving program that ultimately developed

25:04.994 --> 25:14.546
into the development fund. How had you solicited 
money prior to that? We had dues, $5 a year dues.

25:25.599 --> 25:31.166
There is a national organization of alumni 
secretaries, and I started going to their

25:25.599 --> 25:31.166
meetings. I got a lot of big ideas. And I discovered 
that these schools that have an annual giving fund

25:33.766 --> 25:42.858
were just taking in a whole lot more money than we 
were. And so I got the idea, and we just gradually

25:44.420 --> 25:48.145
promoted. There again, it was our promotion. And 
we held joint meetings with the board of directors

25:50.989 --> 26:01.242
of the college in one thing or another, and had to 
work out some financial arrangements. And the

26:02.133 --> 26:05.158
college helped us a little financially for a 
number of years. And that's the way it came about.

26:09.546 --> 26:17.020
So then what you did was substitute an annual 
giving program for dues.

26:19.835 --> 26:22.418
your dues were, what, $5 a year? $5 a year. And this 
was used primarily to support the office of the...

26:23.238 --> 26:27.422
Support the office, yeah. Of the secretary, 
executive secretary and the staff. All the

26:30.225 --> 26:31.987
support they had. And so you really didn't have, at 
that point, you didn't have any money that you

26:32.667 --> 26:37.893
could really kind of turn over to the college. No, 
we didn't have any money at all. We were doing well

26:39.774 --> 26:41.636
to keep our heads above water. Where did you have 
offices at that point? Uh...

26:48.809 --> 26:49.630
Well, let's see. When I came down here, we had 
officers in the Civil Engineering Building. Then

26:57.220 --> 27:00.845
we had a fire, and we had officers in the basement of 
the M.E. Building, and then we moved down to the

27:00.905 --> 27:07.153
System Administration Building. I don't 
remember just where we were when we, where our

27:07.173 --> 27:13.281
officers were when we started the development 
fund. I would guess probably we were down at the

27:14.763 --> 27:18.126
administration building then. That was early in 
the 30s, I think, or no, early in the 40s. Yeah,

27:22.210 --> 27:26.914
because that's mid-30s, the systems building, I 
believe, was mid to late 30s. Yeah, yeah. And

27:31.017 --> 27:36.202
certainly the former students were deeply 
involved in the promotion of the Memorial Student

27:31.017 --> 27:36.202
Center. Well, yeah, there again, we had to promote 
the idea. It was, it had been suggested through the

27:45.121 --> 27:46.663
years. Students, one thing or another, one class 
way back there had put their class, these classes

27:47.865 --> 28:09.415
usually end up the year with a few hundred dollars, 
and they had designated that as the beginning of a

27:47.865 --> 28:09.415
student union fund, and the former students held 
it. And so we started promoting it, and made that I

28:13.893 --> 28:19.962
guess the first objective of the annual giving, 
which was a natural. And we got, I think, $250,000,

28:19.982 --> 28:26.472
and then, of course, the college put the rest of the 
money up. But it was largely a case of moving the

28:26.492 --> 28:35.024
board of directors, you know, get them to take a 
step. People were pretty scared in those days,

28:35.565 --> 28:38.329
much more than they are now. They were scared of 
what people were saying. I used to argue about

28:43.120 --> 28:49.207
having Sunday picture shows when I was over at the 
air-dome. We'd have Sunday picture shows. I was

28:50.828 --> 28:55.193
afraid of what people would

28:50.828 --> 28:55.193
say. Of course, they probably would have said 
plenty of it. Yeah, I can remember. But that's

29:01.440 --> 29:02.921
pretty much past. I don't think, oh, you have to 
keep it in your mind. You can't go out and do

29:06.005 --> 29:12.672
violence to public opinion, but it's far less than 
it was. But the $250,000 which the association

29:14.947 --> 29:29.094
contributed towards the MSC,

29:14.947 --> 29:29.094
can you recall about how long it took you to 
accumulate that amount? I believe three years. I

29:31.138 --> 29:33.883
believe we had a three year objective.
