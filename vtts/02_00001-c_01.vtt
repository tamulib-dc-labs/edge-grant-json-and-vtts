00:02.377 --> 00:06.502
Some of these kids take their future too seriously, in my opinion.

00:08.165 --> 00:14.213
Daddy may want them to be an engineer, but they may not have any interest in being an engineer, but here they are in engineering.

00:14.994 --> 00:22.303
So I tell it, it's not too late to make changes in your life when you're here.

00:22.483 --> 00:27.490
Because I made numerous changes before I wound up in physics, and I wound up in physics

00:27.470 --> 00:31.694
And there's some truth in why I wound up in physics, because of that long walk across campus.

00:31.754 --> 00:34.777
It's not all nonsense.

00:35.738 --> 00:39.281
And so I tell that story, and I had a bright young kid in my class.

00:39.922 --> 00:41.403
He was an engineer, electrical engineer.

00:42.564 --> 00:45.687
And after the class was over, he made a pretty good grade.

00:45.707 --> 00:47.569
I've forgotten, probably an A, but I don't remember.

00:48.430 --> 00:50.792
Oh, he'd come see me, tell me how he's doing.

00:50.812 --> 00:54.355
And then he graduated in engineering.

00:55.853 --> 01:02.002
And he got a great job, I think, with Exxon.

01:02.022 --> 01:03.404
And he's a black kid.

01:04.445 --> 01:06.208
And so he was a black kid.

01:06.228 --> 01:07.550
He's got an engineering degree.

01:07.610 --> 01:14.059
He's off with one of the major oil companies and doing great.

01:14.079 --> 01:15.260
And he'd call me every now and then.

01:16.863 --> 01:18.785
And one Christmas, I got this phone call.

01:18.805 --> 01:22.030
He says, Dr. Adair, I just called and told you I'm quitting my job.

01:23.798 --> 01:26.082
Oh, Robert, what are you doing?

01:26.102 --> 01:26.823
Yep, yep.

01:26.843 --> 01:28.285
He said, I've always wanted to be a doctor.

01:28.966 --> 01:36.298
My dad wanted me to be an engineer, and I remember what you told me in class and what you told me along the way that I've got, I should make it.

01:36.758 --> 01:37.840
It doesn't matter what I'm going to do.

01:38.020 --> 01:42.267
I've got to be the best I can at whatever I do, and everything will work out.

01:42.287 --> 01:43.449
I've always wanted to be a doctor.

01:44.030 --> 01:46.414
I'm going to come back home, live at home, Houston.

01:47.435 --> 01:51.662
I'm going to go to the University of Houston, take some biology, and then I'm going to apply to medical school.

01:51.642 --> 01:54.334
Well, okay, Robert, that's what you think.

01:54.998 --> 01:56.766
Good luck.

01:56.786 --> 01:59.519
So that kid came back, went to Houston.

01:59.539 --> 02:00.724
He had offers from

02:02.375 --> 02:06.822
You can name the five best medical schools in the country.

02:07.243 --> 02:08.205
Chose to go to Vanderbilt.

02:09.066 --> 02:13.693
So he went to Vanderbilt, got his medical degree three years ago.

02:14.595 --> 02:16.178
He's now interning at Tulane.

02:16.598 --> 02:19.042
I think he's finished, residency I guess I should say.

02:20.084 --> 02:25.092
I think he's in residency in radiology.

02:26.658 --> 02:28.061
He's going to do great.

02:28.361 --> 02:28.962
He's going to do great.

02:29.323 --> 02:32.529
And I'm sure he's got a father who's unbelievably proud of him.

02:33.070 --> 02:34.553
Along the way, he's gotten married.

02:34.593 --> 02:36.176
We went down to Houston to the wedding.

02:36.196 --> 02:37.880
And now he has a daughter.

02:38.200 --> 02:42.368
He must be two years old now, living over there in New Orleans.

02:42.388 --> 02:45.274
So things like that, of course, are the high points.

02:45.575 --> 02:50.339
What about any research, publication, high points?

02:51.400 --> 02:51.960
Not really.

02:51.980 --> 03:03.470
I had fun when I was doing research, enjoyed it, and published a number of papers, not an outstanding number, but enough for those days.

03:03.630 --> 03:05.692
I haven't done anything in years.

03:05.892 --> 03:07.193
I've just been a bureaucrat.

03:08.434 --> 03:09.755
Let's shift into athletics.

03:11.917 --> 03:15.160
You were, went on the athletic council what year?

03:15.140 --> 03:15.741
1979.

03:15.761 --> 03:16.562
Yeah, 79.

03:18.746 --> 03:24.595
O.D.

03:24.635 --> 03:25.576
Butler was going off.

03:26.919 --> 03:30.304
I think somebody else was going off, and there were going to be a couple of openings.

03:33.088 --> 03:41.822
I ran into Marvin Tate on campus one day, and he asked me if I'd be interested, and I'm sure.

03:43.034 --> 03:46.218
Next thing I know, Chuck calls me.

03:46.238 --> 03:51.004
Chuck Sampson calls me and says, there are going to be some openings.

03:51.024 --> 03:53.968
We're going to interview a few faculty members, and your name's been mentioned.

03:55.630 --> 03:58.814
And so— Sampson was the chairman then.

03:58.834 --> 03:59.695
He was the chairman then.

04:00.896 --> 04:01.758
Asked me to come over.

04:01.798 --> 04:07.725
I think I had lunch with Marvin and Chuck and just chatted.

04:09.224 --> 04:16.136
And another one who was done the same way was John Hoyle.

04:16.156 --> 04:19.922
And so I thought, well, Hoyle will be named to the athletic council.

04:19.942 --> 04:21.124
I mean, he's a baseball player.

04:21.144 --> 04:29.258
And so then, I don't know, I guess, I don't remember whether Chuck called me.

04:35.701 --> 04:37.304
I don't remember.

04:38.226 --> 04:40.590
Maybe Jarvis was called or something.

04:40.650 --> 04:44.597
Anyhow, it said that I had been appointed.

04:45.319 --> 04:46.701
Then I found out Hoyle had been too.

04:46.781 --> 04:49.526
We both went on at the same time.

04:49.646 --> 04:59.785
I was on the council and just a member of the council learning the situation.

04:59.950 --> 05:03.334
What were the realities of being on the athletic council in the early years?

05:05.056 --> 05:06.018
What did you all deal with?

05:06.738 --> 05:08.661
We dealt with a lot of things in those days.

05:08.681 --> 05:10.263
We dealt with everything in those days.

05:10.543 --> 05:10.864
Budget.

05:11.444 --> 05:12.486
Budget came through us.

05:13.327 --> 05:17.452
In fact, that was one of the reasons that Earl was on there, Earl Bennett was on there.

05:17.512 --> 05:19.835
He worked very closely with Wally on the budget.

05:20.816 --> 05:24.220
And the budget had to be approved by us before it went anywhere else.

05:24.200 --> 05:30.370
So we were involved in the budgeting and we were involved in the scheduling of the contests.

05:30.470 --> 05:34.356
We were involved in hiring of coaches.

05:36.820 --> 05:45.634
So we were involved in most everything that is involved nowadays where the Athletic Council is not involved in much of anything except academics.

05:46.289 --> 05:48.413
All right.

05:48.433 --> 05:50.918
Chuck becomes interim president, Chuck Sampson.

05:51.358 --> 05:51.619
Right.

05:52.020 --> 05:54.164
What happened to the athletic council at that point?

05:54.184 --> 05:55.867
Earl became the interim chair.

05:56.227 --> 05:56.909
Earl Bennett.

05:56.929 --> 06:00.335
Earl Bennett became the interim chair and things went along normally.

06:01.798 --> 06:03.100
And then when

06:04.885 --> 06:10.191
Frank was named president, then Chuck came back as chair of the council.

06:11.592 --> 06:14.055
Stayed on with Frank as vice president for a while.

06:15.316 --> 06:22.404
And then the board hired Jackie.

06:22.424 --> 06:29.852
Of course we didn't know anything about what was going on until suddenly Jackie was paraded in front of the athletic council.

06:30.513 --> 06:32.715
We all met him.

06:33.893 --> 06:36.716
And then the announcement was made that he was hired.

06:36.736 --> 06:40.120
I have a feeling that he had already been hired, but I don't know that.

06:40.160 --> 06:41.262
I just suspect he was.

06:42.063 --> 06:47.088
Is it correct that the athletic council had nothing to do with his being identified as the coach?

06:47.469 --> 06:50.653
No, no, not a thing.

06:51.654 --> 06:54.056
Of course, it came as a shock to Frank also.

06:56.139 --> 06:59.363
In fact, he got very upset about it.

06:59.563 --> 07:03.107
He called a meeting of the academic council

07:04.437 --> 07:07.000
and had a closed-door meeting with them.

07:07.900 --> 07:10.843
And I don't remember much about that meeting.

07:10.863 --> 07:14.927
I think my main job at that meeting was trying to see that there weren't any eavesdroppers at the door.

07:15.668 --> 07:23.676
I remember, I don't think I heard a whole lot of what he said to the, to the group, but he was threatening to resign and all those good things.

07:25.238 --> 07:29.101
And, but then the board went ahead and hired Jackie.

07:29.121 --> 07:31.744
You know the board hired Jackie

07:32.433 --> 07:38.781
as athletic director and told him they wanted him to come down here and fire Tom and take over.

07:39.902 --> 07:40.503
Tom?

07:40.523 --> 07:41.544
Wilson.

07:41.564 --> 07:42.946
Oh, oh, oh.

07:42.966 --> 07:44.148
The board fired Marvin.

07:45.269 --> 07:47.932
That left the athletic director position vacant.

07:47.952 --> 07:57.344
Wally was named interim athletic director, and then the board went off to hire Jackie and asked Jackie to come down and fire Tom and take over both jobs.

07:57.705 --> 07:58.606
Jackie told him no.

07:59.667 --> 08:00.448
He wouldn't do that.

08:00.884 --> 08:05.532
that if they wanted him, they're going to have to hire him as both jobs, but they're going to have to fire Tom first.

08:05.552 --> 08:07.182
So then the board came back and fired Tom.

08:08.073 --> 08:12.358
and then hired Jackie at both jobs, athletic director and head football coach.

08:13.699 --> 08:20.927
And then he came down and the rest is history.

08:20.947 --> 08:25.111
And you were on the athletic council during his years?

08:25.131 --> 08:35.042
I was on the athletic council and then Frank called me over one day and asked me if I would chair the athletic council.

08:35.022 --> 08:51.165
He wanted to split things up a bit and Chuck would remain as faculty representative to the NCAA, but he wanted me to chair the council and be represented to the Southwest Conference.

08:51.666 --> 08:55.832
He wanted it that way for a period of time.

08:56.723 --> 09:06.531
That was a transition time because Chuck was still members of various NCAA committees and so he didn't want to remove him and lose those positions with the NCAA.

09:07.422 --> 09:15.774
And so we stayed in that position for a couple of years, and I don't think Chuck liked it, and I know his wife was furious about it, but I didn't.

09:15.794 --> 09:20.921
You know, all I was done, I thought I was asked to do it and said yes.

09:22.763 --> 09:29.633
I didn't ask for the job, didn't campaign for the job, but when asked to do it, I said yeah, I'd do it.

09:29.613 --> 09:39.565
And then after a year or so of that, then I was named to NCAA representative too.

09:40.847 --> 09:43.210
It's pretty clumsy if you're not both.

09:44.311 --> 09:57.527
So after about a year then, I was then representative to the NCAA, the Southwest Conference, and chaired the Athletic Council.

09:57.760 --> 09:59.323
And this is in the mid-'80s.

09:59.603 --> 10:01.587
That would have been about 84, 85.

10:03.270 --> 10:07.057
And I stayed in that position for five or six years.

10:07.077 --> 10:09.983
And then Bill Mobley came.

10:10.003 --> 10:11.145
Now I've forgotten when did he come.

10:11.165 --> 10:16.895
He came in 88, didn't he?

10:16.915 --> 10:17.537
Is that right?

10:17.557 --> 10:19.380
So I had that position for that long.

10:22.516 --> 10:38.413
Because my job in those days as faculty representative was, I was involved in all the investigation going on about the Jackie business.

10:39.293 --> 10:48.523
And so I worked with our lawyer, Ted Hayoski, and I spent many days in Chicago with our Chicago lawyers on the NCA problems.

10:49.347 --> 10:55.656
And then the board named Mobley to be the next president.

10:56.177 --> 11:02.927
Our appointment in front of the NCA Committee on Infractions was August the 13th.

11:03.708 --> 11:10.939
The board named Mobley president sometime in early July, effective August 1st.

11:12.582 --> 11:14.224
Hayaski and I are in Chicago.

11:15.048 --> 11:24.683
We call back, find out the board is naming Mobley president, and we tell the secretary, send word to Mobley that we'll be there tomorrow to brief him on this.

11:24.884 --> 11:33.377
I mean, he's suddenly got to represent the university in front of the NCAA on August 13th, less than two weeks after taking the job.

11:33.982 --> 11:36.907
Two hours later, we got a message back, stay in Chicago.

11:36.927 --> 11:37.608
He's coming there.

11:39.070 --> 11:50.689
And so the next morning, Mobley shows up in Chicago, and we spend two days in Chicago going over everything with him, with the lawyers, and getting him up to speed on this.

11:50.709 --> 11:57.981
And then we all fly back together, and that's when I find out what his plans are for Robert Smith.

11:59.159 --> 12:12.195
I was riding back next to Bill Mobley, and he told me that he was going to name Robert the executive vice president or whatever, vice president or chief vice president or something.

12:13.177 --> 12:17.882
I thought, oh geez, we're in trouble now.

12:17.983 --> 12:22.348
I think Bill Mobley was a very, very good president.

12:23.678 --> 12:30.249
It was really fun for me to see the contrast with Frank.

12:30.269 --> 12:33.073
I think Frank was a good president, but in a much, much different way.

12:34.235 --> 12:45.293
And I think I've told you that I was really tempted to have some fun with Frank, but I restrained myself because Frank shot from the hip.

12:45.313 --> 12:46.155
I mean, you could go in.

12:46.195 --> 12:47.276
He said, that's a good idea.

12:47.497 --> 12:48.218
I need to do it.

12:48.198 --> 12:55.151
And I was just really aggravated at the growth of administrators on this campus.

12:55.712 --> 13:00.360
So I wanted to go in to Frank and say, Frank, there are too many administrators in the dean's office.

13:00.440 --> 13:03.846
Won't you make each dean send an assistant dean back to the faculty?

13:03.867 --> 13:05.870
I bet he would have done it.

13:05.890 --> 13:08.535
I bet he would have done it.

13:08.515 --> 13:15.883
All right, how well did Mobley in those first weeks, how well did he handle the NCAA?

13:15.963 --> 13:17.805
Beautifully, absolutely beautifully.

13:20.488 --> 13:31.840
We went in front of that committee and he did impress them, that he was here to take charge and that things were changing and that he was going to be the boss

13:32.191 --> 13:39.104
And he already had a resolution from the Board of Regents that athletics was his responsibility.

13:40.026 --> 13:43.532
And I think he saved us from a much more severe penalty.

13:44.594 --> 13:50.706
And he had gotten the...

13:52.272 --> 13:55.477
authorization from the board that he was in charge of athletics.

13:55.757 --> 14:06.374
And so later in that year, that fall, when athletics blew up again, he was in a position to negotiate with Jackie over time for him to go.

14:07.415 --> 14:09.338
And so he was able to pull that off.

14:09.699 --> 14:12.063
And that was not a unanimous vote of the board.

14:12.143 --> 14:20.676
There was a movement to fire Bill Mobley that I am told went up to about a

14:20.656 --> 14:31.190
six and three or five and four vote in favor of letting him do what he was going to do or firing him and finding a president who would keep Jackie.

14:31.550 --> 14:40.642
Who else during that NCAA investigation, who else deserves a pat on the back for standing up for what was right?

14:40.662 --> 14:47.271
The leadership for the former students association that came in after that.

14:48.652 --> 15:04.872
The biggest change I've seen from my perspective as faculty representative of the NCAA has been in the former Students' Association because the former Students' Association were not behind Mobley in firing Jackie.

15:06.117 --> 15:21.544
By the time we got around to our future troubles, where we got in trouble with the Dallas former student putting athletes to work and paying them for not doing enough or anything,

15:22.840 --> 15:32.714
The former students came down hard, hard on him and almost unanimously were behind the president in that this university is going to do it right.

15:33.695 --> 15:52.341
And that was a—and so the leadership there, and I'm not sure I can name you those people, but if you look at who was the president of the association in 89, 90, 91, those leadership people carried that whole organization into the right

15:52.321 --> 15:55.226
into the field.

15:55.246 --> 16:13.876
In hindsight, did A&M, as far as you look back, did A&M handle itself reasonably well in dealing with the infractions that were committed back then?

16:14.677 --> 16:15.358
Yes.

16:16.099 --> 16:19.645
It's hard to

16:21.160 --> 16:26.131
to say what was really going on.

16:26.151 --> 16:28.377
I don't know what was really going on.

16:28.397 --> 16:32.065
And it's accurate to say that Jackie was not

16:33.985 --> 16:37.871
implicated in any of the violations directly.

16:40.115 --> 16:50.231
So he was certainly guilty by association because he had assistant coaches who were doing things that definitely should not have been done.

16:51.292 --> 16:56.280
The question might be was he ordering them to do them, and you have to believe that he

16:56.260 --> 16:57.841
knew what was going on.

16:59.263 --> 17:03.427
So he certainly was involved.

17:03.547 --> 17:21.403
Now I believe Jackie's real problem was in thinking he could change some real criminals into being good citizens.

17:22.204 --> 17:23.365
I have to think

17:24.188 --> 17:37.035
that Jackie thinks that he was off on a road to becoming a bad person, and some coach got him by the collar and turned him into a reasonably good citizen.

17:37.055 --> 17:44.391
Now, Bill Mobley wouldn't agree that he's a good citizen, but I think he's a reasonably good citizen, but because

17:44.371 --> 17:47.354
I think Switzer must be the same way.

17:48.656 --> 17:56.745
These coaches think they can take these renegade kids that nobody should be gambling on and turn them into good citizens.

17:57.506 --> 18:04.975
Jackie got burned and burned badly by George Smith and Switzer got burned by a number of them up there in Oklahoma.

18:06.236 --> 18:08.539
They were outlaws from day one.

18:08.519 --> 18:15.365
And I think Switzer and Sherrill knew they were outlaws, but they felt, I can make a good kid out of this kid.

18:17.727 --> 18:20.530
We had some basketball infractions also during your day.

18:21.851 --> 18:22.051
Right.

18:22.071 --> 18:26.075
In hindsight, is there anything we didn't do that we should have in dealing with that?

18:26.095 --> 18:27.276
We hired the wrong coach.

18:30.539 --> 18:35.764
We hired a coach who was young, naive, and got himself in trouble quickly.

18:35.784 --> 18:37.125
I think he might well have

18:38.978 --> 18:54.501
intended to do things right, but he got caught up in the New York agents, and so we had him for one year, and we suffered.

18:54.861 --> 18:59.168
We took some real painful shots from that.

18:59.188 --> 19:02.893
I think we did all we could.

19:05.320 --> 19:07.002
I don't know what else we could have done.

19:07.522 --> 19:12.347
He was doing things he shouldn't have been doing with a New York agent.

19:12.447 --> 19:13.288
Any other sports?

19:13.328 --> 19:15.991
Did we have any shortcomings?

19:16.011 --> 19:20.075
Well, we had the second go around in football, you remember.

19:20.095 --> 19:25.841
We had the Jackie Sherrill 1988 accusations that we got severe penalties for.

19:26.201 --> 19:28.183
Then we had the basketball.

19:28.203 --> 19:34.990
And then we had the situation where the Dallas former student had

19:34.970 --> 19:41.188
a number of kids on the payroll and they were not on the job working as they should.

19:42.532 --> 19:47.427
We got hammered pretty hard for that.

19:49.178 --> 19:51.202
But I don't know what else we could have done.

19:51.863 --> 19:57.695
We were doing more monitoring of that situation than anybody else in the country.

19:57.715 --> 20:01.322
And still this person did that.

20:01.342 --> 20:07.474
We got hammered by the NCAA for not having a better monitoring system when we had the best in the country.

20:08.821 --> 20:17.313
We got hammered for lack of institutional control when in fact we had more control than any university in the country.

20:17.333 --> 20:24.222
We just were the first to get caught at not monitoring the summer jobs the way they now are monitored.

20:24.543 --> 20:27.226
The NCA's changed the rules primarily because of us.

20:28.068 --> 20:37.140
You now have NCA rules that require you to keep logs on where they are working, who they're working, all these things that nobody was doing in those days.

20:37.829 --> 20:43.057
Other sports, no problems?

20:43.077 --> 20:43.458
No.

20:46.683 --> 20:48.406
Not that I can remember.

20:48.566 --> 21:00.765
How much time did your duties as faculty representative and chairman, how much time did those consume?

21:01.673 --> 21:06.400
Rises and falls, but during Jackie Sherrill's time it took lots of time.

21:06.420 --> 21:10.547
Lots of time when we were going through those troubles or any of our investigations.

21:10.747 --> 21:18.619
My responsibilities declined in years though because all through the NCA structure you now have compliance coordinators.

21:18.599 --> 21:22.163
And when I was first in this job, there were no compliance coordinators.

21:22.323 --> 21:23.404
I was a compliance coordinator.

21:23.884 --> 21:31.472
But by the time we came to our second round of problems, we had a compliance coordinator.

21:31.492 --> 21:34.555
And that compliance coordinator reported to Robert Smith.

21:35.296 --> 21:42.323
And so a lot of the traveling around the country with the lawyers was for them, not for me.

21:42.343 --> 21:43.965
And I was just a...

21:44.266 --> 21:52.559
In the NCIA's view, I was an overseer still, but I was not actively participating in the investigations.

21:52.639 --> 21:59.470
So my time consumption for those type things went down with the compliance coordinators.

21:59.530 --> 22:05.059
In certain respects, in several areas, that's the way it is now because there's a compliance coordinator,

22:05.039 --> 22:09.591
I meet with him on a monthly basis, have a meeting with him tomorrow.

22:09.972 --> 22:14.845
He and I, and I have the chairman of the Athletic Council there.

22:15.246 --> 22:17.832
That's a story we can also talk about.

22:18.695 --> 22:21.141
I meant to get to it, but didn't a minute ago.

22:21.543 --> 22:24.968
And then we have the academic supervisor in the athletic department.

22:24.988 --> 22:30.957
I meet with him monthly, along with the chairman of the athletic council.

22:30.977 --> 22:35.363
And these people are the people who are doing the overseeing, doing the work.

22:35.383 --> 22:36.304
I am overseeing them.

22:36.405 --> 22:41.592
We have Pam Reynolds and a young lady who's now working in registrar's office.

22:41.612 --> 22:43.635
I meet with them monthly.

22:44.054 --> 22:49.461
And so I am sort of the umbrella over it all, but they are doing the work.

22:49.481 --> 22:54.247
Whereas in the old days, I was actually doing some of the work.

22:54.267 --> 23:00.895
So I spend 25, 30 percent of my time at that now.

23:01.816 --> 23:06.382
I am on some, I am on the most important NCA committee now.

23:06.462 --> 23:07.643
That's something with the NCA.

23:07.664 --> 23:10.467
You've got to stay in this job, and I'll come back to that in a minute.

23:10.447 --> 23:14.417
in order to be able to get into some of these significant positions with the NCAA.

23:14.838 --> 23:16.362
I am now there.

23:16.763 --> 23:23.640
I am chairing a subcommittee of the Academic Eligibility and Competition Committee for the NCAA.

23:24.843 --> 23:27.730
And my subcommittee is continuing eligibility.

23:28.267 --> 23:37.346
And so all rules that have to do with keeping a student athlete eligible either pass through or originate in my committee.

23:37.366 --> 23:47.187
And so that's a fairly significant job within the NCAA that I've managed to come to because of my longevity in this job.

23:47.943 --> 23:52.655
Now, that brings us back to when I had all jobs.

23:52.695 --> 24:00.696
I was chair of the Athletic Council and the athletic representative of the NCAA and to the Southwest Conference.

24:00.756 --> 24:01.658
Mobley was president.

24:02.159 --> 24:04.365
The faculty senate was rumbling about these

24:05.054 --> 24:09.343
people on the athletic council staying there for long periods of time.

24:09.423 --> 24:15.275
And so I went to Mobley and said we probably needed to make some changes.

24:16.378 --> 24:18.502
And I wanted to reorganize the athletic council.

24:18.703 --> 24:19.665
I think I made a mistake.

24:19.745 --> 24:21.488
I'm not happy with the reorganization.

24:21.508 --> 24:23.232
But the one point that I am happy with

24:24.055 --> 24:28.320
is that we separated the job.

24:28.340 --> 24:45.663
And so my recommendation to Mobley was that we have six faculty members on the athletic council, each two serving, or all serving three-year terms, going off, two going off every year, and eligible for a reappointment one time.

24:46.404 --> 24:47.565
And so that's what we've gone to.

24:47.815 --> 24:52.967
And one of those six then would be appointed chair of the Athletic Council, and that's the way we do it now.

24:52.987 --> 24:55.512
Bart Childs is the chairman of the Athletic Council.

24:56.535 --> 25:02.027
That delighted me because that then gave responsibility for the on-campus stuff to that chair.

25:02.868 --> 25:08.153
That person is the person that needs to interact with faculty, senate, and this.

25:08.733 --> 25:11.696
My responsibilities are primarily off campus.

25:11.716 --> 25:14.338
I am on the governing board for the Big 12 Conference.

25:14.919 --> 25:17.261
I'm on the committees for the NCAA.

25:18.022 --> 25:27.230
And that's enough, because I have, oh, eight or 10 meetings a year lasting two or three days that keep me out of town.

25:28.571 --> 25:32.655
And then doing the homework for all those meetings,

25:33.597 --> 25:42.941
And so having all the other on-campus stuff and chairing the meetings, the monthly meetings of the council and working with the council, that's somebody else's responsibility.

25:43.021 --> 25:44.164
I'm a member of the council.

25:44.988 --> 25:48.895
but I don't have to worry about calling the meetings and running the meetings and that sort of thing.

25:48.915 --> 25:53.383
So we made that change, and that made the faculty senate happy.

25:54.265 --> 25:57.390
I serve at the pleasure of the president.

25:57.410 --> 26:05.545
He can remove me at any time he wishes, and I can stay in the job as long as he wishes.

26:05.525 --> 26:14.239
But all other faculty members come and go on the council, and that keeps faculty senate happy and the other faculty, plus it's a healthier situation.

26:14.259 --> 26:16.723
You have new people coming in.

26:16.743 --> 26:25.778
The mistake I made was recommending a structure that has it as large as it is, because we used to be a working group, and we used to

26:26.416 --> 26:29.822
be able to sit down and really do something.

26:29.842 --> 26:38.396
Now there are 15 or 20 people at the meetings, and some of them are voting members and some of them aren't, and I must say that the structure idea was mine.

26:38.436 --> 26:51.478
I must also say that we didn't have that many vice presidents in those days either, but each vice president now is on it, dean of faculties is on it, and then you have a liaison person from here, from there, from there, and it's just too many people.

26:52.066 --> 27:02.358
Of the presidents, and I'm only going to ask the positive, of the presidents you've worked with in athletics, which one has the clearest understanding of athletics and how it ought to operate?

27:03.059 --> 27:09.026
Bill Mobley, although that might be selling Ray Bowen a little short.

27:09.046 --> 27:11.489
I'd have to put them pretty close, maybe.

27:11.509 --> 27:14.192
I guess I'd say I see

27:14.172 --> 27:30.493
I see Mobley more clearly because he followed Frank, and Frank is tremendously anti-NCAA, and so that pretty well restricts his objectivity on most things we had to deal with.

27:30.811 --> 27:34.721
But he, I don't know if you ever talked to him about the NCAA, but he despises the NCAA.

27:35.683 --> 27:45.968
Which, and I'm not going to ask the negative on this, which coaches of any sports would you give at A&M, would you give the greatest praise to?

27:49.694 --> 27:54.142
Yes, well, coaches are coaches.

27:58.450 --> 28:03.720
But I haven't been dissatisfied with very many coaches.

28:03.886 --> 28:12.514
I really, I can mention Tony Barone because there are aspects of him that I really, really liked.

28:12.935 --> 28:18.120
There are aspects of his characteristics that I despised.

28:21.924 --> 28:30.392
He cussed and hollered and screamed and that drove me crazy.

28:30.412 --> 28:31.733
His kids went to class.

28:31.797 --> 28:33.663
and progressed academically.

28:33.683 --> 28:43.275
I bet if you look at the number of graduates, I haven't done this, but I bet you would find that Tony Barone's kids graduated at a better rate than any of the other coaches we've had.

28:43.998 --> 28:46.581
He lived across the street from us for two years.

28:46.601 --> 28:46.882
Oh, really?

28:47.022 --> 28:49.365
He has yet even to wave back to me.

28:49.385 --> 28:50.907
Is that right?

28:50.947 --> 28:52.469
Well, he's a very bitter man right now.

28:52.810 --> 28:54.812
I went over to chat with his son twice.

28:55.513 --> 29:00.800
First day we were there, and then when the son announced he was going to Marquette, I went over to take my business card.

29:00.880 --> 29:04.605
I said, the current AD at Marquette I hired at UTEP.

29:04.585 --> 29:12.054
take this card to him, tell him I ask you to bring it, introduce yourself to him, it wouldn't be bad at all for you to know the A.D.

29:13.536 --> 29:15.579
No Barone ever said boo.

29:16.279 --> 29:17.921
And they were that way in the whole neighborhood.

29:18.662 --> 29:22.968
I suspect they were not that way when they came.

29:24.009 --> 29:27.353
She was very, very

29:29.020 --> 29:32.104
happy, pleasant person.

29:32.284 --> 29:33.166
He was too.

29:34.487 --> 29:42.018
I liked him a lot, but he, I don't understand it either.

29:42.038 --> 29:47.225
I think he's a good coach and why he hadn't found a job, but I think he's better at Texas A&M.

29:48.226 --> 29:58.200
I mean, we got the beautiful facility and just as we get the beautiful facility that he probably has an opinion that if he had that facility, he could recruit.

29:58.180 --> 30:06.733
And he's bitter over that, but he's probably bitter too because he hasn't found a job elsewhere, because he's a good coach, in my opinion.

30:07.734 --> 30:16.126
But I didn't like the hollering and screaming and cussing and ranting and raving part of his characters.

30:16.266 --> 30:21.454
But to answer your question,

30:26.176 --> 30:27.878
Coaches in any sport to praise.

30:27.898 --> 30:28.919
Yeah, yeah.

30:28.939 --> 30:45.156
Well, you know, I don't really get to know the lesser coaches, but you know, one of the real princes along the way was the old baseball coach, Tom.

30:45.597 --> 30:47.118
Oh, yes.

30:47.519 --> 30:48.300
Tom, Tom, Tom.

30:48.360 --> 30:49.060
Oh my goodness.

30:49.261 --> 30:49.921
Yeah.

30:49.941 --> 30:55.187
Yeah, because I felt the same way about him.

30:56.973 --> 31:01.500
I really like the golf coach who's just now retiring, Charlie.

31:01.520 --> 31:02.882
I had an interview session with him.

31:03.243 --> 31:04.765
Did you?

31:04.785 --> 31:04.925
Uh-huh.

31:04.945 --> 31:08.751
And you've got to like Ted Nelson.

31:10.314 --> 31:12.076
I had him as a freshman the first semester.

31:12.116 --> 31:12.717
Did you really?

31:12.858 --> 31:13.138
Yeah.

31:13.178 --> 31:14.760
Hard, hard, hard working.

31:14.780 --> 31:17.485
He didn't make high grades, but he sure did work ahead.

31:17.625 --> 31:24.195
That's the kind of kid I'm looking for, a hard worker.

31:24.952 --> 31:28.228
When I start thinking about our high-profile coaches,
