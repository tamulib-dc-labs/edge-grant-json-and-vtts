00:08.401 --> 00:20.743
Now, in terms of tools which you use, is the 
computer the most important development? It's

00:20.763 --> 00:21.324
not for me. I mean, I think it is a pretty important 
development. No, as far as the, gosh, you know, I

00:24.970 --> 00:29.819
don't have that many tools. I know.

00:36.920 --> 00:49.107
I

00:36.920 --> 00:49.107
think

00:36.920 --> 00:49.107
the board instrumentation is probably the most 
important thing as far as it's been added to the

00:36.920 --> 00:49.107
oceanographic.

01:02.030 --> 01:13.307
They give us, because the current meter has given 
us a kind of instrument, a kind of measurement,

01:02.030 --> 01:13.307
which is very different from what we had before. 
The CTDs and STDs and so forth give us very much more

01:13.607 --> 01:25.565
detail about the vertical distribution of 
properties and the boundaries to go from mass to

01:13.607 --> 01:25.565
mass casts. But it's just better information of 
the same kind, whereas the current meter really

01:25.585 --> 01:31.294
gives

01:34.261 --> 01:48.060
I think

01:34.261 --> 01:48.060
that's about the most important thing is that. 
Those are not my tools, those are tools that

01:48.080 --> 01:55.611
other people have developed. Besides your own 
work, although it's very difficult to separate

01:56.013 --> 02:05.101
this way, what was the most amazing innovation in 
oceanography during your period? What sort of

02:05.261 --> 02:07.343
idea struck you? Oh, that's kind of an interesting

02:07.743 --> 02:17.852
question. I wonder what that answer could be to 
that. Something that I could, you know, was really

02:18.773 --> 02:25.058
surprised

02:18.773 --> 02:25.058
by.

02:41.643 --> 02:50.395
Oh

02:41.643 --> 02:50.395
gosh, I don't know. I suppose, I suppose

02:50.415 --> 03:08.258
the, oh I think I know the most, the thing that 
surprised me the most was the, and it surprised me

02:50.415 --> 03:08.258
very early on, was the long distance sound 
transmission in the so far channel. I

03:09.672 --> 03:35.831
went

03:09.672 --> 03:35.831
with Yui and some others down to London, and they 
had some ships out far away,

03:09.672 --> 03:35.831
thousands of miles away, and we had radio in 
contact with them. They dropped a charge. I think

03:36.311 --> 03:38.194
they dropped a charge somewhere off Brazil, one 
block at the end of the South Channel. We heard

03:39.068 --> 04:04.575
for each ship,

03:39.068 --> 04:04.575
as they heard the sound go by, and we were sitting 
there at night, you know, on this radio shack in New

03:39.068 --> 04:04.575
London, where the Atlantis would report in, and 
the Lero or something, I can't remember the names

03:39.068 --> 04:04.575
of it, the Jetson and so forth, the different ships 
would report in, and they just heard the sound

03:39.068 --> 04:04.575
going by. There were long periods in between, of 
course, 20 minutes or something like that. The

04:07.064 --> 04:25.783
idea that sound could go so slowly, you could hear 
it, just

04:07.064 --> 04:25.783
a small sound at a long distance. That was really 
something which was just . Your future, what do you

04:26.664 --> 04:28.286
intend to do next? Well, I guess I'm going to I try to 
play some

04:35.617 --> 04:50.233
limited role in this equatorial experiment. And 
that's going to be essentially trying to get some

04:50.253 --> 04:59.903
long time series measures at the equator from the a 
small outfit, a small ship

05:01.148 --> 05:24.711
based

05:01.148 --> 05:24.711
on a planet like Ocean Island or the Gills. Think 
about doing that for the next two or three years.

05:26.813 --> 05:28.675
And I think that's a major thing I'd like to do. And I 
think if I can, I'd kind of like to organize

05:31.169 --> 05:50.528
a set of density measurements in the center of the 
subtropical gyro of the Atlantic Ocean. Using

05:51.267 --> 06:09.607
cruises of opportunity, when ships go through and 
they go across the North Atlantic Ocean to get some

05:51.267 --> 06:09.607
systematic station data to look at angular 
fluctuations and so forth on the central landing

05:51.267 --> 06:09.607
gyre. It's kind of a place which interests me 
recently. And I think if I consciously try to

06:11.753 --> 06:39.347
figure out how to set up a program like that, then it 
won't cost very much that ships that are going

06:11.753 --> 06:39.347
across back and forth anyway, if I keep aware of 
their schedules and so forth, somehow I can get 20

06:11.753 --> 06:39.347
or 30 hydrographic stations on each of those 
cruises that goes across, and maybe divert the

06:11.753 --> 06:39.347
line of the cruise a little bit.

06:42.398 --> 07:00.541
Six

06:42.398 --> 07:00.541
years projected is a great deal for academicians. 
Our minds change so quickly. Yeah, I know they do,

07:03.458 --> 07:23.981
but I think those are the two things that I think 
could be associated with some

07:03.458 --> 07:23.981
useful kind of way. There were two backup 
questions I wanted to pick up very quickly that I

07:24.642 --> 07:29.227
missed. What were your parents' occupations? My 
father was a chemist. in

07:35.133 --> 07:59.640
several different letter-making concerns in the 
United States this week and later on. And my mother

07:59.660 --> 08:01.842
was a housewife first, and she was kind of a public 
relations person, fundraiser for hospitals. And

08:01.862 --> 08:03.604
at the end of her life, she was working mostly 
trying to raise money for hospitals. Were you

08:04.529 --> 08:08.936
always directed towards the sciences? Well, I was 
more

08:09.036 --> 08:22.336
influenced

08:09.036 --> 08:22.336
by my grandfather, I think. He was a lawyer, but I 
had, yeah, I've always wanted to be a lawyer. I was

08:26.302 --> 08:26.803
always a scientist. Chemistry, science, 
astronomy, electrical things. All my high school

08:27.824 --> 08:29.507
things.

08:31.293 --> 08:53.323
The afternoons

08:31.293 --> 08:53.323
would be, many afternoons would be spent by going 
down Lower Manhattan and looking at the chemical

08:31.293 --> 08:53.323
supply house windows and seeing if they had some 
Florence flasks that they were selling off in a

08:31.293 --> 08:53.323
sale or something, buying for 15 cents or 
something, right? There was a canvasser of

08:53.343 --> 08:54.685
scientific good stores. They almost always had 
St. Martin County. We had a summer program, Dusty

09:01.384 --> 09:02.346
Chemical Company. Where did you do your 
undergraduate

09:02.366 --> 09:08.154
training? Yeah, I was doing my undergraduate 
training. Well, yeah. Before that, it was the

09:11.800 --> 09:21.054
Freeport High School on Long Island.

09:21.074 --> 09:21.935
Before that, in Townsend Harris, Manhattan. The 
Brooklyn Public School, 217. And never varied all

09:23.504 --> 09:27.291
this time from scientific orientation. Yeah, I 
always wanted to be a scientist. I had chemical

09:32.782 --> 09:40.616
companies trying to make chemistry sets for kids 
and sell them for 25 cents, you know, things like

09:32.782 --> 09:40.616
that. Fourth grade. I was very strong in chemistry 
for a long time.

09:51.500 --> 09:54.044
I always wanted to go into science. When I went to 
Yale, we had some kind of diagnostic achievement

09:54.225 --> 10:04.682
test or something.

10:04.702 --> 10:10.251
And after I took those tests, they counseled me. 
the basis of those tests, but it was very basically

10:10.906 --> 10:21.562
unwise for me

10:10.906 --> 10:21.562
to go into science. And he gave me some good 
arguments, you see. I mean, you know, I really am

10:22.905 --> 10:30.316
kind of weak on certain kinds of formal, 
quantitative ways of thinking. Mathematics

10:30.336 --> 10:33.781
doesn't come as easily to me as it does to other 
people. Abstract thinking doesn't. I can see

10:37.484 --> 10:52.360
that, and I

10:37.484 --> 10:52.360
recognize

10:37.484 --> 10:52.360
that very clearly. But, so

10:52.380 --> 11:00.930
he wanted me to go into law, he said. And, well, 
gosh, no, I just didn't want to, that was all. So, I

11:02.472 --> 11:07.457
mean, I could see, as the years went on, that it had 
some serious difficulties, really, to

11:02.472 --> 11:07.457
basically, Basically, certain kinds of things I 
really can't do very well. Take all that terrible

11:17.242 --> 11:34.884
business in thermodynamics, where you're 
constantly taking different partial

11:17.242 --> 11:34.884
derivatives of things with respect to other 
things. And the formal manipulations of

11:34.904 --> 11:37.748
thermodynamics You have some body of gas, which 
you're squeezing, and heating, and cooling, and

11:38.352 --> 11:50.479
pressing, and expanding in constants, and this 
and constant that, and so forth. I try to vision.

11:52.764 --> 11:56.412
I'm very sure that the people who are good at that 
don't really think in very concrete terms. I think

11:59.856 --> 12:01.699
they think in very formal terms. And I find myself 
absolutely

12:02.180 --> 12:20.010
unable to depart on an intellectual tour very far, 
which goes away from some very clear concrete

12:02.180 --> 12:20.010
terms. And so So I can understand things, simple 
mechanics and so forth, and do calculations in it.

12:34.185 --> 12:43.324
But when it gets formal or abstract, then it 
becomes quite difficult for me. If you look at

12:43.726 --> 13:12.737
mechanics, I'm probably wrong about this, but if 
you look at mechanics, probably the part of

12:43.726 --> 13:12.737
mechanics which is formulated most nearly to 
thermodynamics, for example, in some sense, is

12:43.726 --> 13:12.737
the use of Hamiltonians in setting up a mechanical 
problem. It

13:13.392 --> 13:33.308
just seems so absolutely, it seems so absolutely, 
crazily abstract to set up a mechanical problem in

13:13.392 --> 13:33.308
that formulation.

13:34.418 --> 13:37.242
But I just, I just can't do it. And I know to other 
people it's just an alternate means of problem

13:37.262 --> 13:52.423
solving which is self-evident and obvious to them 
as what looked to me like a straightforward way to

13:37.262 --> 13:52.423
do it. So I think, I think those tests were right, 
you know, really. But these people really, people

13:56.408 --> 14:02.316
really The motivation

14:02.583 --> 14:19.550
sort

14:02.583 --> 14:19.550
of counts too, but if you want to do something, you 
start to move on to do what you want to do, I think. I

14:19.570 --> 14:20.612
maybe could have had quite a lot of fun out of it. 
Anything you'd like to add

14:20.632 --> 14:25.019
to the table? Well, I don't think so.

14:29.684 --> 14:40.107
Any advice you'd like to give to young 
oceanographers?

14:40.267 --> 14:45.499
I don't really think it's possible because the

14:50.947 --> 15:08.972
Things have changed so much over a 30-year period 
that I wouldn't feel confident to give people

14:50.947 --> 15:08.972
advice as to what kind of a satisfactory life that 
they... I haven't tried to influence my children,

15:09.152 --> 15:16.262
for example, to be interested in science or 
oceanography. particularly,

15:16.867 --> 15:32.981
I think that it's not at all

15:16.867 --> 15:32.981
clear that it would be a nice thing for them to do. I 
guess what I would, I guess

15:33.002 --> 15:45.793
my only, I wouldn't give advice, but the wish

15:33.002 --> 15:45.793
that I would have for people is that they could find 
some intellectual area in the world that was

15:46.938 --> 16:03.861
pretty much underdeveloped.

16:03.962 --> 16:10.671
And they could, by some lucky chance, find some 
place like that and develop some structure there.

16:10.691 --> 16:12.253
Now, I don't suppose it is oceanography. There are 
probably areas of knowledge and science, and even

16:12.689 --> 16:27.749
in oceanography, which are sufficiently 
undeveloped so that those names aren't on a map

16:12.689 --> 16:27.749
yet. We don't know what those areas are, and if a 
person is lucky enough to find some kind knowledge

16:37.006 --> 16:58.516
space like that, so he can have the excitement and 
fun of poking around there first of all by himself,

16:37.006 --> 16:58.516
then I should think he could have

16:37.006 --> 16:58.516
a fun intellectual experience a little bit 
similar to the one that I've been able to have. But,

16:58.536 --> 17:00.499
of course, You can enter into a, it's like, you 
know, it's like getting into a, in the virgin

17:01.981 --> 17:12.078
forest kind of period of things. It would still be 
very exciting, I suppose, to,

17:12.098 --> 17:24.900
in the highly evolved municipal stage, still find 
interesting things to do. But when you have the

17:25.673 --> 17:39.408
area of science a little bit all to yourself, and 
you can sort of ask the first questions, that is

17:25.673 --> 17:39.408
kind of fun. I would recommend that they would have 
some fun if they can find a place to be a pioneer, and

17:39.428 --> 17:51.161
they'd have some

17:39.428 --> 17:51.161
fun being a pioneer. I don't know. I think it must be 
partly luck when you find those places. And

17:56.183 --> 18:01.209
certainly places which were pioneering places 
aren't after a while. The first pioneers have gone

18:01.229 --> 18:02.511
through. That's right. They've messed it all up. 
No longer virgin timber. Now it's cut over. That's

18:08.618 --> 18:09.199
right. It's all messed

18:09.219 --> 18:15.406
up. It's all cut over and built up or something. 
That's not advice. It's just, I guess it's advice.

18:19.351 --> 18:20.552
But it's not advice. It doesn't give you any 
indication as to how to implement it, where to

18:20.572 --> 18:24.317
look.

18:27.318 --> 18:29.565
But I think there's an opportunity to buy around 
everywhere.
