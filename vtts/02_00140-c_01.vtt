00:01.938 --> 00:04.522
I'll tell you this one instance.

00:08.287 --> 00:12.193
One of the first things I did was to find out when the A&M Club met.

00:13.696 --> 00:25.193
My office was a block from the Rice Hotel and someone told me that the A&M Club met on Mondays at noon.

00:25.213 --> 00:29.980
And it might have been the very first Monday that I had a job.

00:30.000 --> 00:31.422
At lunch I went to the

00:31.705 --> 00:33.508
lunch at the Rice Hotel.

00:35.931 --> 00:44.403
And the president was, I didn't know anybody in the room.

00:44.423 --> 00:46.125
They were all older.

00:47.968 --> 00:53.496
And the president was saying, does anybody here go to Lamar High School?

00:53.516 --> 00:56.160
And I held up my hand.

00:56.180 --> 00:57.221
I was the only one that did.

00:58.844 --> 01:00.025
And he asked me my name.

01:00.045 --> 01:00.506
I told him.

01:00.606 --> 01:01.307
He said, well,

01:02.367 --> 01:13.980
Coach Homer Norton wants a football player that's out there and wants you to go to Lamar and find out about him.

01:14.020 --> 01:26.333
His name is Robert Smith and report back to us what you can find out about him.

01:27.190 --> 01:35.101
And I tell you, if I hadn't been there that day, I don't know, I would have had a whole different life, I believe.

01:35.121 --> 01:38.827
Because that started me out in the football program.

01:41.130 --> 01:45.817
And that took so much of my time from that moment on.

01:47.059 --> 01:52.547
So much of my time was spent in football recruiting.

01:52.587 --> 01:54.730
Why Sarah put up with me, I don't know.

01:54.890 --> 01:56.893
Because I was out at night.

01:57.295 --> 02:05.184
a lot of times chasing these kids and taking them, lending them my car.

02:05.765 --> 02:13.514
I mean, this Robert Smith would come over to our house in his girl's car, which would be better than mine.

02:14.475 --> 02:22.304
One time there was a Cadillac that parked in front of my house, and he got my car to go out on the date because he wanted to have the car.

02:23.846 --> 02:25.328
Well, we just did all that.

02:25.780 --> 02:53.492
It went on, and I spent, it was a career chasing Robert Smith, and of course we ended up with him after, we could write a book about the trials and tribulations of that romance, but we ended up with him, and he didn't make All-American one year, and later played football for the Detroit Lions, and I don't see Rob Bob anymore, but he's a fine man, and still lives in Dallas, and has a family,

02:54.940 --> 02:56.762
He was a great athlete for us.

02:56.942 --> 02:58.404
He gave me a lot of satisfaction.

02:59.426 --> 03:00.066
Look back.

03:01.168 --> 03:08.136
What feelings do you hold in your heart?

03:08.156 --> 03:17.508
Well, they're warm feelings of great people, a lot of great people, wonderful people.

03:18.189 --> 03:24.036
Not only the people that I went to school with and were there when I was in school,

03:24.775 --> 03:40.864
In working with, in the recruitment that I got into after A&M, the older Aggies in town wanted to hear about these athletes.

03:41.004 --> 03:48.538
Wanted to hear about Robert Smith, wanted to know who he was, what he was doing, what chances we had to get him.

03:48.890 --> 03:55.380
Jake Hamlin and Ted Moley, and people you probably don't know at all, but these are older Aggies.

03:55.961 --> 03:59.867
Doc Dar, he was in the class of 22.

03:59.887 --> 04:02.251
Most of these guys were in that era.

04:03.173 --> 04:04.755
Well, they were so nice to me.

04:05.107 --> 04:18.924
Just because I graduated from A&M and I was working for A&M and they invited me and Sarah to dinner at their house and I got to meet.

04:21.287 --> 04:30.338
They would have, sometimes they would have Dr. Miss Harrington at parties and I would be invited to the

04:30.723 --> 04:38.311
president of A&M and I thought I had died and gone to heaven to be in the same room with the president of A&M.

04:38.331 --> 04:41.315
But that, those are the warm feelings.

04:41.415 --> 04:45.539
Always felt at home around in Aggie.

04:45.559 --> 04:45.659
Why?

04:45.679 --> 04:46.220
And still do.

04:46.460 --> 04:46.620
Why?

04:47.061 --> 04:47.742
Because of that.

04:47.982 --> 04:59.835
Because of, I was always able to trust them and always a friend and always

05:00.828 --> 05:05.755
willing to help me in anything that I needed to do.

05:05.775 --> 05:08.519
They were certainly helpful in my business too.

05:08.599 --> 05:17.651
You've spent more than 50 years now as an active alumni leader of every sort.

05:17.972 --> 05:23.940
What caused you to be so broadly service interested?

05:24.000 --> 05:26.483
I know of nothing at A&M that you haven't supported.

05:29.468 --> 05:29.788
Why?

05:31.372 --> 05:33.575
No, I don't know why either.

05:33.595 --> 05:34.777
I don't know why either.

05:34.897 --> 05:45.131
I just, when you look to, there are a lot of Aggies like that, though, and they see a job that needs to be done.

05:45.231 --> 05:47.534
They just try to help with it.

05:47.614 --> 05:49.157
Are you paying a debt of gratitude?

05:50.038 --> 05:50.118
Huh?

05:50.138 --> 05:52.561
Are you paying a debt of gratitude to A&M?

05:52.902 --> 05:53.202
Sure.

05:53.663 --> 05:58.830
Well, yes, it's partially a repayment, but it's also...

05:59.283 --> 06:00.785
I'm enjoying it.

06:00.805 --> 06:03.688
I mean, I get a lot out of it, too.

06:03.708 --> 06:09.115
So it's not all a give situation.

06:11.658 --> 06:17.444
Somebody said, we all got more out of being at A&M than we'll ever be able to give back.

06:17.885 --> 06:19.507
Well, that's probably right.

06:19.527 --> 06:21.229
That's probably right.

06:21.249 --> 06:23.612
Yeah.

06:23.632 --> 06:26.074
I would certainly agree with that.

06:26.094 --> 06:27.836
I'm not ready to do that.

06:27.857 --> 06:28.357
Let's quickly.

06:28.657 --> 06:29.138
Thank you.
