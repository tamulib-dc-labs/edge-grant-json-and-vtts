WEBVTT

00:01.263 --> 00:08.875
This is Terry Anderson, and we are testing the 4th 
of May, 1982. Testing,

00:09.055 --> 00:18.931
testing, today's date is May 4th, 1983. We are 
trying to find out if we need a microphone.

00:27.565 --> 00:28.907
Okay, okay. that that higher ranking guy at the 
appropriate time will step forward when they're

00:29.377 --> 00:38.746
ready to fill a position that says, I've got the man 
that needs to go in that position. In other words,

00:38.826 --> 00:42.409
he's in a position to act as your ombudsman. He 
maneuvers you into positions where you can accept

00:42.429 --> 00:50.076
more responsibility and thus stand a better 
chance of being promoted. I think from that

00:51.457 --> 00:57.763
standpoint that it would be human nature for a West 
Point graduate or an Air Force Academy graduate by

00:58.030 --> 01:07.602
his associations with people from that same 
institution would be more likely to latch on to one

00:58.030 --> 01:07.602
of those bright and shining young guys to maneuver 
him than it would be somebody from some other

00:58.030 --> 01:07.602
place. By the same token, I think the same would be 
true for Texas A&M. I know a lot of pretty

01:12.829 --> 01:17.474
high-ranking guys. General Wayman Nutt, who's a 
two-star over at San Antonio right now, met him at a

01:18.275 --> 01:24.443
meeting not long ago. We weren't together three 
minutes before we had already found out several

01:25.351 --> 01:30.438
people we knew of each other. Almost instant 
rapport established because of our commonality

01:31.440 --> 01:37.368
of our background. And so when the time comes, he's 
going to be looking at people like that, people

01:38.470 --> 01:45.840
that he knows, to plug in where they need to be 
plugged in. So yes, it's an advantage from that

01:46.481 --> 01:51.308
standpoint.

01:52.604 --> 01:58.550
through the association and his knowing your 
background, then he'd be in a position to push you

01:52.604 --> 01:58.550
when the time comes. What class is he? Wayman is, I 
believe he's the class of 49.

02:07.999 --> 02:09.160
How do you spell his last name? N-U-T-T, Wayman 
Nutt. He's the commander of the San Antonio Air

02:11.382 --> 02:14.405
Logistics Center. Got about 23,000 people 
working for him over there. He's a two-star. Heck

02:20.583 --> 02:21.184
of a knife. And he's still on active? Still on 
active duty. That's why I haven't heard

02:23.566 --> 02:32.256
of him. When you compare the officers from the 
Academy versus the officers from A&M, would you

02:32.276 --> 02:43.468
say one is better or less prepared or better 
prepared? Once again, I really haven't had that

02:45.102 --> 02:49.409
much contact with the Academy graduates. Most of 
them, of course, are in the Army, and I've always

02:49.489 --> 02:53.015
been in the Air Force. Yeah, but I mean even ever 
since they built the Air Force Academy. Yeah. I

02:59.205 --> 03:01.528
would say they're comparable. I really would. I 
think they're pretty well comparable. They've

03:04.553 --> 03:08.199
got a lot in common.

03:08.219 --> 03:12.426
So I really wouldn't think that...

03:13.840 --> 03:27.469
I would think by the very nature that your graduate 
of the service academy, whichever service it may

03:13.840 --> 03:27.469
be, Annapolis, West Point, Air Force, is going to 
have to give you some, just a little bit of an edge on

03:13.840 --> 03:27.469
someone that did not go there. And I think we all 
accept that. But that's not to say that you can't

03:29.994 --> 03:34.363
overcome that through other actions. OK, now 
during the interview, we've talked about people

03:34.850 --> 03:39.214
who've had some impact on your life. And I was 
wondering if any, while you were at A&M taking

03:39.254 --> 03:51.345
classes and in the Corps, if there were any of the 
professional soldiers here who had an impact on

03:39.254 --> 03:51.345
you, or any of the professors? Yes. There was a guy 
that was the assistant commandant at the time. I

03:58.411 --> 04:03.135
was a sophomore here, the name of Taylor Wilkins.

04:04.280 --> 04:07.584
At the height of the Korean War, I was doing very 
poorly academically. I was on probation and very

04:08.224 --> 04:13.711
near getting kicked out of A&M for scholastic 
problems. I was spending all my time in the Corps

04:14.772 --> 04:16.734
activity. We didn't do anything that I wasn't 
there because I loved it. As a result, I neglected

04:19.837 --> 04:21.619
my schoolwork. This was after I changed my major 
from petroleum engineering to business. And I

04:27.086 --> 04:28.307
really liked what I was doing. It's just that I 
didn't have enough time to do it all. And the Corps

04:30.149 --> 04:33.713
came first with me.

04:35.245 --> 04:48.541
mother and dad were concerned that with the Korean 
War in full flower, that I was going to flunk out and

04:35.245 --> 04:48.541
that I was going to get drafted in the Air Force, 
that they wanted me to be in the Air Force. So they

04:48.781 --> 05:01.356
came down and we all had talked and apparently an 
Air Force recruiter had gotten a hold of them and

04:48.781 --> 05:01.356
said, you know, if you can get him on in here now, we 
can put him in the Air Force and he can be an enlisted

04:48.781 --> 05:01.356
guy in the Air Force. And so That made sense to me 
because I knew I was just really having a rough time

05:04.338 --> 05:09.065
staying in school. So we went to see Taylor 
Wilkins. And he sat down and talked with my father,

05:11.969 --> 05:21.843
my mother, and myself for two hours, I guess, and 
just flat talked us out of the whole thing. He said,

05:21.903 --> 05:23.425
look, you can do it. He gave me a lot of positive 
thinking kind of thing. Don't think you're going

05:27.571 --> 05:28.732
to flunk out. Think you're going to stay and do what 
it takes to make it. And that was kind of a turning

05:32.297 --> 05:34.260
point for me. So I went ahead and stayed in A&M. And 
sure enough, I did make my probation. And I was able

05:38.611 --> 05:41.255
to stay in and eventually graduate. But we were 
within minutes of me resigning from A&M and

05:42.216 --> 05:49.124
joining the Air Force as an enlisted guy. And 
Wilkins, Taylor Wilkins, had the insight to see

05:49.144 --> 05:56.353
that that was going to be a mistake, that I could 
make it. I had the potential to make it if I just

05:56.413 --> 05:58.516
worked at it. And he told me, you know. So you get 
some demerits and have to walk the bullring. Don't

06:03.605 --> 06:05.027
spend so much time on your shoes. Don't spend so 
much time on your brass. Start spending more time

06:06.749 --> 06:09.012
studying. And I did. And it paid off. So I would have 
to say that I wouldn't be here right now if it

06:12.076 --> 06:16.802
weren't for Taylor Wilkins. What happened to him? 
He later left and went to Allen Academy, which is a

06:19.545 --> 06:26.474
local military academy in town, as their 
commandant. And then he died. I think he had a heart

06:29.236 --> 06:31.299
attack or something. I don't know just why. I was 
never real close to Colonel Wilkins other than the

06:32.822 --> 06:44.460
fact that I knew who he was, and he took enough 
interest in me to spend that couple hours with me

06:32.822 --> 06:44.460
and my mother and father to tell us what he thought. 
And we listened to him. That's one time we listened

06:46.484 --> 06:50.711
to a guy that was right, and we were wrong. How about 
professors here? Oh, my.

06:58.092 --> 07:03.038
I remember the hardest course I ever had was 
statistics, and we had a guy by the name of Miles

06:58.092 --> 07:03.038
Hamilton. Everybody had nicknames then, and I 
guess they still do. But Dr. Hamilton was my

07:08.005 --> 07:12.311
statistics professor.

07:15.154 --> 07:21.703
There's a professor here that had a great deal of 
impact on me, gave me a lot of inspiration. He's

07:21.869 --> 07:23.010
still here, by the way. He's a salesmanship or 
marketing professor named Herb Thompson in the

07:23.631 --> 07:29.378
College of Business Administration. Herb's 
always been a good friend of mine, and he gave me a

07:29.398 --> 07:34.143
lot of encouragement. I made some good grades 
under him. There was a gentleman that doesn't

07:36.906 --> 07:43.814
teach here anymore, but he was a business law 
professor, and he's still a practicing attorney

07:36.906 --> 07:43.814
here in town named Phil Goode. Phil was a Great 
inspiration. He always liked me, and I liked him,

07:47.151 --> 07:51.017
and he gave me a lot of encouragement. I did well in 
some of his classes. By the time you were about a

07:53.340 --> 07:55.985
junior then, were you picking your grades up? 
Yeah, right. My sophomore year was my bad year.

08:00.672 --> 08:07.603
Keep in mind that when I changed my major, I changed 
it at the middle of my freshman year, and I had a

08:00.672 --> 08:07.603
whole bunch of F's. bad, bad Fs. And I had all that to 
overcome. So my sophomore year was kind of the year

08:11.688 --> 08:16.435
that I turned around. And then my junior and senior 
year, I picked up and did pretty well. What was the

08:20.021 --> 08:26.090
feeling among the student body toward the war in 
Korea? I mean, did a lot of them decide, let's quit

08:26.190 --> 08:32.460
going to college and go over there and fight? Did 
they think it would be better for them to stay here

08:32.744 --> 08:36.630
and become officers? That was the general 
opinion. Most of us felt that it was something that

08:39.535 --> 08:50.131
might go on for a while and that we could best serve 
our country and ourselves by staying in school,

08:39.535 --> 08:50.131
getting a commission, and then going. As it worked 
out, when I graduated, I had a set of orders for

08:50.252 --> 08:56.141
Yokohama, Japan. I was reported to Yokohama and 
then for further assignment into the Korean area.

09:01.229 --> 09:04.834
But almost exactly the same thing happened with me 
as happened with my father. I'd already received

09:05.936 --> 09:11.444
my orders to report to the port of embarkation, and 
the war ended. And so I've never served one day

09:12.165 --> 09:15.209
overseas. After all these years, I've never 
served one day of overseas assignments. You can

09:19.595 --> 09:21.839
see it's all been stateside. And so I've got mixed 
emotions about that. Nobody wants to be in a

09:23.641 --> 09:27.367
conflict, or no one wants to be in combat. But I kind 
of feel, you know, I almost have guilt feelings

09:28.028 --> 09:31.152
that here I'm a brigadier general, and I've never 
seen any combat. I guess it's dumb to say I feel

09:37.079 --> 09:48.170
guilty about that, but when I think of the prices 
that some other generals have paid, I really feel

09:37.079 --> 09:48.170
like I hadn't really earned it. But apparently 
someone thinks I have, or I wouldn't be there. That

09:53.615 --> 09:54.716
is very interesting. Now, when you were about 
ready to graduate, When did you make up your mind

09:59.532 --> 10:03.357
that you wanted to go into the military? Or was the 
military going to help you by taking you anyway? I

10:07.181 --> 10:08.322
didn't have any choice. There was no choice to be 
made. At that time, I had two years active duty and

10:11.346 --> 10:21.318
six years in reserves as an obligation to my 
accepting the contract. That was a two-year

10:21.338 --> 10:22.920
contract. I spent two years on active duty. I 
married... my wife between my junior and senior

10:26.971 --> 10:32.179
year in August before my senior year. So I was 
married my senior year. And then did you move to a

10:35.364 --> 10:37.928
married dormitory? We moved into an off-campus 
apartment, which is still here, just over on the

10:37.949 --> 10:45.340
south side on Montclair Street. And so my wife and 
I, of course, were in the service together. We

10:50.769 --> 10:53.333
liked it pretty well. At the end of the two years 
active duty hitch, we just decided that we didn't

10:54.443 --> 10:58.430
want to make a career out of it. And so I was on a 
military leave from Sears Roebuck. I went to work

11:02.338 --> 11:10.593
for Sears Roebuck right after I graduated and 
worked for them for a short time and then went on

11:02.338 --> 11:10.593
active duty for two years. And so I had returned 
privileges with Sears. And so I went back to work

11:13.819 --> 11:17.346
for Sears and worked for them for a number of years. 
But this must have had a pretty big impact on you

11:17.765 --> 11:28.158
going into the active duty when you had thought 
about the military for many years. You'd loved the

11:28.238 --> 11:29.179
Corps. You'd liked the regimentation. And you 
liked all the military aspects of the Corps. Were

11:33.765 --> 11:37.950
you let down when you really got to the real thing, 
the US military? Or is let down too strong?

11:42.381 --> 11:43.543
Disillusioned in some way? I can't really, 
neither of those words fit. I was surprised, I

11:46.527 --> 11:49.752
think might be a better word. It was more like a 
day's work. It was kind of a business. People

11:55.180 --> 11:57.723
worked eight to five a month through Friday and 
they went home. And that just wasn't really the way

11:58.685 --> 12:01.609
I'd envisioned it. But it was such a much more 
relaxed pace than I was used to. I was used to spit

12:06.723 --> 12:09.427
and polish at a certain time, a certain time. When I 
got on active duty, everybody was kind of laid

12:10.248 --> 12:12.551
back. And we had a job to do, and we did it. My active 
duty outfit was with an air evacuation outfit. It

12:20.223 --> 12:27.274
was a hospital-type airplane where we evacuated 
and moved sick patients from one part of the

12:20.223 --> 12:27.274
country to another. And I was a supply officer. was 
not able to go to flying school because of my

12:31.492 --> 12:34.736
eyesight. It's always been poor. And at those 
times, you had to have a 20-20 vision before they

12:36.999 --> 12:41.744
would let you go to pilot school. And so I've never 
flown an airplane. I couldn't fly one now if I had

12:47.431 --> 12:48.993
to. I've never been to pilot training. But anyway, 
I was a supply officer for this air evacuation

12:52.097 --> 13:01.228
outfit and really enjoyed it. a two-year hitch. 
Part of that time I was at Lackland in processing

13:03.997 --> 13:15.268
and getting in, and part of the time after that I 
went to Cheyenne, Wyoming to supply school, which

13:03.997 --> 13:15.268
was a six-week school, as I recall. So I really 
wasn't on active duty at the station at Mobile,

13:15.988 --> 13:23.936
Alabama, Brooke Air Force Base, which has since 
been decommissioned. The base is no longer there,

13:23.956 --> 13:29.781
but it was a big air material area center at that 
time. They now call them air logistics centers. At

13:32.663 --> 13:34.985
that time, they called them AMLAs, Air Material 
Areas. And Mobile Air Material Area was where I was

13:36.547 --> 13:42.955
stationed at Brookie Air Force Base Mobile. But it 
was quite a change from what I, it wasn't anything

13:44.637 --> 13:51.646
at all like I expected. Well, I don't, again, don't 
want to put words in your mouth, but it sounds like

13:51.666 --> 13:59.295
you were maybe a little bit too energetic and 
driving for the peacetime Air Force. Is that true?

14:08.878 --> 14:10.020
Not really 100%. What would you explain? There was 
enough challenge there, but I was bored at times.

14:16.930 --> 14:18.933
There was not enough to keep me busy all day every 
day. I'd find myself going to the gym and shooting

14:19.474 --> 14:29.468
goals because all my work would be done by coffee 
break in the morning.

14:31.540 --> 14:35.205
I was a little bit, I've always been the type that I 
like to be behind all the time. I like to always have

14:35.265 --> 14:39.031
something that's waiting for me that needs to be 
done. And of course in the job I have now, that's no

14:40.312 --> 14:43.998
problem. But I was really kind of bored in the Air 
Force. I really was. And I know that's a problem we

14:49.746 --> 14:52.790
have today in the Air Force. A lot of people are in 
jobs that they just don't have enough to do. And so I

14:58.879 --> 15:00.501
try to remedy that any time I find it. But I think 
that had probably a lot to do with my deciding to get

15:03.407 --> 15:09.660
off active duty. What about your wife? What was her 
feelings? She just never was really as gung-ho

15:12.205 --> 15:15.592
military as I was. She was raised in the oil field. 
Her father was an oil field worker. and uh west

15:23.195 --> 15:52.813
texas or east uh mostly south america venezuela 
primarily and so she had spent a lot of her time in a

15:23.195 --> 15:52.813
of course a south american oil camp is somewhat 
like a military camp in that you've got perimeter

15:23.195 --> 15:52.813
fence bob wire on top guard on the gate uh you've got 
a camp boss that's kind of like a base commander

15:23.195 --> 15:52.813
yeah and a lot of regimentation and so she she just 
uh never did really go that crazy about the

15:23.195 --> 15:52.813
military And so I think we were both pretty well 
ready to get off active duty. Of course, I had to

15:59.597 --> 16:03.503
stay in the reserve six years because that was part 
of my obligation. But by the end of that six years, I

16:03.543 --> 16:06.467
was really hooked on the reserve program. I've 
always felt that it was a worthwhile program, the

16:06.687 --> 16:11.294
citizen-soldier type approach. The war in this 
country have always been fought by the masses of

16:13.577 --> 16:21.729
people that are grocerymen and service station 
people and plumbers and carpenters. It's never

16:21.829 --> 16:22.750
been ready. fought by career people. That's just 
the nucleus. Of course, the problem we're faced

16:27.206 --> 16:31.249
with now, the next war we have is going to become a UR 
war. We're not going to have time to train the

16:31.309 --> 16:35.833
bakers and grocerymen and so forth. And so I think 
we're in a more dangerous environment today than

16:36.994 --> 16:41.038
we've ever been. Because of the time that's left? 
Because of that, and plus because of the very short

16:46.022 --> 16:51.387
time frame that all of our war plans call for. We're 
looking at three-day wars, seven-day wars. If

16:56.082 --> 16:57.865
it's a long war, it might last 30 days. Whereas 
before, we're talking about years and years and

16:58.466 --> 17:01.852
years. We'll never see those kinds of wars again. 
Because of technology. Yes. Now, I'm not saying

17:07.001 --> 17:13.612
that we can't have an El Salvador or something like 
that that could draw on for years. That's not what

17:13.772 --> 17:14.634
I'm talking about. I'm talking about an all-out 
war. where the entire resources of this nation are

17:18.755 --> 17:21.838
thrown into it. We'll never have a war like that 
that will last very long because of the nature of

17:23.239 --> 17:28.003
the conflict. It'll be over very quickly. And 
nobody will win, of course. Well, after two years

17:35.670 --> 17:46.180
out of active duty, you decided to return to 
reserve status. Tell me about the reserves in the

17:46.514 --> 17:55.524
mid-1950s, and why did you become so hooked on them 
after your six-year obligation? I think probably

17:55.544 --> 17:58.688
a lot of the same reasons that I enjoyed the Corps so 
much. It was a group of guys, got to be real close to

17:59.108 --> 18:01.691
them. A lot of them are still around town here. We 
had what we felt to be an important job, that is to be

18:05.776 --> 18:16.268
ready to be called in case we were needed, with next 
to zero money and next to zero equipment to train

18:05.776 --> 18:16.268
and operate with. It was kind of a challenge, 
really. It's kind of like the old boy's got camping

18:18.514 --> 18:20.436
trips. He used to go and live off the land. Then, of 
course, I've been in the Air Force Reserve Program

18:23.820 --> 18:39.717
long enough to watch it go from the days where you 
watch the Air Force story on film over and over down

18:23.820 --> 18:39.717
in the basement of the post office building with 
zero equipment up to the point now that we're

18:23.820 --> 18:39.717
getting F-16s off the assembly line. It has just 
been marvelous to watch the growth of the Reserve

18:40.878 --> 18:46.204
Program. And we're really a viable force now. 
Whereas before, all we could be would be fillers

18:49.538 --> 18:53.044
for active duty units. Now, the Air Force Reserve 
really is split into two different areas. One is

18:58.713 --> 19:07.146
what we call the unit program, which means that we 
have numbered flag-carrying units that can go to

18:58.713 --> 19:07.146
war as a unit. military airlift wings, fighter 
wings, and so forth, F-16s. We've got A-10s and all

19:12.947 --> 19:20.397
kinds of different planes and units that can go to 
war and function as a unit independently of

19:12.947 --> 19:20.397
everybody else if we had to. Then we have the other 
portion, which is the portion that I'm involved

19:21.859 --> 19:26.586
with now. I've always been in the unit program up 
until just a short time ago, but we have what we call

19:26.646 --> 19:33.114
the Individual Mobilization Assistance, IMAs. 
We are fillers for active duty units. We train with

19:37.400 --> 19:39.202
the active duty units. In the event of 
mobilization, we know exactly where we go,

19:40.003 --> 19:46.169
exactly who we'll be working with, even where our 
desk is. I've got a desk right now with all my junk in

19:46.269 --> 19:50.433
it at Tinker Air Force Base, Oklahoma City. So if I 
was called active duty, if I were called active

19:51.094 --> 19:56.919
duty, I could be there in less than 24 hours. We have 
to be there in less than 24 hours. And so I keep my bag

20:00.002 --> 20:04.707
packed all the time, ready to be packed. And I'll be 
leaving at 4 o'clock tomorrow afternoon to go up

20:05.311 --> 20:08.796
for three days. My boss is a two-star general. Just 
got promoted to three, by the way. I'm losing him.

20:14.125 --> 20:18.432
He's going to be commander of 15th Air Force at Mars 
Air Force Base at Riverside, California. So I'll

20:18.832 --> 20:20.375
be breaking in a new boss. What is his job now? He's 
the commander of Oklahoma City Air Logistics

20:24.121 --> 20:28.888
Center. I mentioned Wayman Nutt at San Antonio, 
Commander of San Antonio Air Logistics Center.

20:33.049 --> 20:35.032
Well, this is another air logistics center. We 
have one at Sacramento, California, one at San

20:35.052 --> 20:50.277
Antonio, one at Oklahoma City, one at Robbins Air 
Force Base, Georgia, and then the headquarters

20:35.052 --> 20:50.277
for Air Force Logistics Command at 
Wright-Patterson Air Force Base at Dayton, Ohio.

20:50.377 --> 20:55.585
So there are five logistics centers, air 
logistics centers, and he's the commander of one

20:50.377 --> 20:55.585
of them. and that's a two-star slot. So now he's 
getting his own Air Force. He's getting his own

20:59.475 --> 21:04.820
numbered Air Force, 15th Air Force at March Air 
Force Base, and his third star. He gets them both on

21:05.420 --> 21:07.001
the 1st of September. See, I was mentioning to you 
that you had to have a sponsor. He's already making

21:14.008 --> 21:20.833
overtures that when his two-star logistics 
officer slot opens up that he wants me to come out

21:14.008 --> 21:20.833
and take that. So in other words, it's people you 
meet that you do a good job for, and then when the

21:21.314 --> 21:26.078
time comes, and he needs a reservist, well, then 
he'll think of me. So in other words, that's the

21:30.023 --> 21:31.204
way. But that would be a reserve position. It would 
be a reserve position. And it's to augment the

21:34.389 --> 21:38.734
activity force. Basically, the concept is that 
they're on a two-shift operation now. They have a

21:44.702 --> 21:47.386
morning shift and a swing shift. Well, in the event 
of mobility, then they'd add the third shift, the

21:47.406 --> 21:53.854
graveyard shift, and then that would be the one 
that I would take. I would be the actual commander

21:54.425 --> 22:00.173
during an eight-hour portion of the day for that 
air logistics center. And we have 22,000

22:01.615 --> 22:18.279
civilians, and we have responsibilities for, 
well, the new B-1 bombers, all the maintenance on

22:01.615 --> 22:18.279
the new B-1, on the B-52, on the KC-135, on the A-10, 
on the A-7, plus about half the engines in the Air

22:01.615 --> 22:18.279
Force. We have maintenance responsibility for 
those, plus supply responsibilities for a whole

22:18.299 --> 22:22.845
bunch of things. And so then I would be beefing that 
command operation up. But I'm part of the command

22:29.538 --> 22:30.819
section. Wherever the commander goes, I go. When I 
go, I get my staff car with the star on the bumper,

22:32.501 --> 22:37.446
and my office is right next to his. And I'm part of 
the real Air Force for the three days that I'm up

22:37.486 --> 22:42.492
there this week. That's fantastic. And it's just 
like being on active duty. And what did this

22:46.636 --> 22:53.423
program, these two different programs, IMA and 
the unit program, when did they develop? I would

22:54.871 --> 22:59.515
say the unit program has been around for a long 
time. I would say the unit program probably is 15

23:00.276 --> 23:06.521
years old or so. So during the Vietnamese? Yes. I 
would say the IMA program probably is seven or

23:10.745 --> 23:18.131
eight years old. Basically what it amounted to is a 
lot of people

23:25.668 --> 23:31.754
Normally the unit program doesn't have very much 
rank in it because, you know, you take a wing

23:25.668 --> 23:31.754
commander as a brigadier general. A group 
commander usually is a full colonel. Well, after

23:34.877 --> 23:47.791
you get up to that point, you're still young, 
you've got a lot of time to go, but if you get

23:34.877 --> 23:47.791
promoted, say, from lieutenant colonel to a 
colonel, and there's not a group open, you know,

23:34.877 --> 23:47.791
you get promoted out of a job is what it amounts to. 
So they started looking around. With all this

23:50.609 --> 23:54.615
talent, all these years of experience, we don't 
want that guy to walk out the door. What kind of a

23:54.816 --> 24:03.510
program can we put together so the Air Force can 
utilize his talents, his past training, and his

23:54.816 --> 24:03.510
experience, and what have you, without losing 
that resource? So they came up with the Individual

24:03.970 --> 24:17.612
Mobilization Program, which enables him to mesh 
in with an existing active duty outfit and just

24:03.970 --> 24:17.612
augment that unit. I think all branches of the 
service have the program now. Oh, and was the Air

24:21.557 --> 24:24.422
Force the first to develop it? That I don't know. I 
don't know who pirated the concept. I just don't

24:29.670 --> 24:31.473
know who originated it, really. But it seems to be 
working very well. Fantastic.

24:39.985 --> 24:47.134
So I would say at Oklahoma City, and of course, I'm 
the ranking reservist there as a brigadier, we

24:39.985 --> 24:47.134
have about seven full colonels. And with all the 
ranks combined, we have close to 300 reserves

24:47.234 --> 24:53.562
assigned to that air logistics center. 300? 
Mm-hmm. And that includes enlisted ranks also. So

24:59.670 --> 25:09.402
in other words, if the whistle blows, that 
organization will have to really get into high

24:59.670 --> 25:09.402
gear, start turning out planes. much more quickly 
than it has been in the past. So we've got a ready

25:12.539 --> 25:14.702
trained pool of people to put in there. And we've 
got people right down the line twisting wrenches.

25:18.629 --> 25:22.315
You can go in there and you won't know which is 
reserves and which is active duty. Just like on

25:24.058 --> 25:26.021
active duty when you can't tell. That's right. So 
it's an exciting time to be in a reserve program.

25:32.392 --> 25:34.596
Well, let's go back to the 1950s. And let's talk a 
little bit about those six years. What time is it?

25:40.006 --> 25:46.818
I've got 4.15, and I'm going to need to wind up by 
4.30, because I've got to get a haircut before the

25:40.006 --> 25:46.818
barbershop closes. We can stop right now. Today's 
June 14th. This is the second interview with

25:51.185 --> 25:54.070
General Cargill. I was interested in, I noticed on 
your resume that you spent about 10 years from 57 to

25:54.455 --> 26:05.612
67 with one or two exceptions as a supply officer 
for the reserves. And I was wondering about any

26:06.353 --> 26:15.147
particular problems you might have had in the 
supply field with procuring certain types of

26:06.353 --> 26:15.147
goods. Were there shortages in certain goods? 
Could you talk about that? I would say that

26:22.838 --> 26:31.149
Historically, we had the same problems during 
that time period that we have today, and that is

26:22.838 --> 26:31.149
shortage of funds with which to buy the things. The 
goods and the products and the parts and what have

26:31.249 --> 26:40.480
you have always been there if you had the money to 
buy them. Now, there's long lead times,

26:41.642 --> 26:46.568
especially on aircraft parts and especially on 
aircraft that are getting old where let's say that

26:46.987 --> 26:51.793
they're not making the aircraft anymore, but 
still they have a parts obligation. They won't

26:52.554 --> 26:54.437
tool up and make eight or ten parts. If they tool up, 
they're going to make a thousand at one time.

26:59.644 --> 27:05.231
Really, when you're talking about supply, you're 
talking about basically two types of supplies.

27:05.311 --> 27:14.243
You're talking about maintenance or 
housekeeping or personal type supplies like

27:05.311 --> 27:14.243
field jackets and cold weather gear and and office 
supplies and things like that. The other type we

27:18.099 --> 27:27.997
refer to as a category is tech supply or technical 
supplies, which is another way of saying aircraft

27:18.099 --> 27:27.997
parts and aircraft related supply items. The 
priority between how much money goes to which of

27:29.079 --> 27:36.553
these different sectors depends on a whole lot of 
factors, primarily the world conditions at the

27:29.079 --> 27:36.553
time. Right now, We're placing emphasis on 
technical supply, sustainability of aircraft,

27:39.299 --> 27:55.115
rapid turnaround in maintenance facilities, so 
technical supplies or parts for aircraft have the

27:39.299 --> 27:55.115
highest priority right now. And it fluctuates 
through year in and year out, depending on what the

27:55.776 --> 28:01.963
imperatives are at the time. And I would imagine 
that it fluctuates from administration to

28:01.983 --> 28:05.807
administration. Yes, it does. Very definitely. 
Would you talk about that? I really haven't been

28:09.556 --> 28:12.580
that close to it on active duty. And of course, 
reservists don't get involved much in the

28:12.600 --> 28:15.944
day-to-day management. But just from a more than 
interested casual observer, it's evident that

28:16.024 --> 28:37.251
right now, for example, under Ronald Reagan's 
administration, and with the emphasis that the

28:16.024 --> 28:37.251
DOD is getting and the money that the DOD is 
getting, that we're going to do much better as far

28:16.024 --> 28:37.251
as readiness is concerned. than we have under past 
administrations. Carter's specifically was

28:39.653 --> 28:45.402
disastrous as far as the readiness is concerned.

28:47.365 --> 28:54.035
But you take the dollars you have and allocate them 
as best you can and stretch them as far as they'll

28:47.365 --> 28:54.035
go. But there's never a day since I've been 
connected with the Air Force been enough dollars.

29:00.044 --> 29:01.426
And I don't really expect there will be. And I'm not 
sure it'd be a healthy thing if we did have all the

29:01.446 --> 29:05.112
dollars we needed for ever thing we had because too 
many other programs would be lacking. It's a

29:11.436 --> 29:12.758
balance. Yeah, absolutely. In what way did the war 
in Vietnam have an impact on your job as a reserve

29:16.902 --> 29:27.073
supply officer?

29:27.093 --> 29:30.877
I really didn't feel that much of an impact. The war 
in Vietnam escalated very slowly. It was a very

29:33.920 --> 29:35.402
long, drawn out, war, there was not a sudden 
declaration of war, complete mobilization. So it

29:41.611 --> 29:43.073
was such a gradual thing. And since my particular 
activity was not called active duty, I really

29:43.154 --> 29:52.972
didn't notice it as far as any impact it had on me as 
reservist. Of course, obviously, we were all

29:52.992 --> 29:55.737
intensely interested in what was happening. But 
how it changed my way of doing business, it didn't

29:56.122 --> 29:59.407
really at all. In other words, the reserve people 
were slighted because the active duty people were

29:59.648 --> 30:07.340
getting more of the supply? No, because at that 
time, we weren't getting anything anyway. Oh, I

30:10.425 --> 30:11.446
see. We really didn't start getting what I 
consider an adequate share of the funding and

30:11.466 --> 30:20.020
equipment until really after the Vietnamese War 
was over. I think after the Vietnamese War was

30:20.080 --> 30:23.125
over, That's when the reserve really began to come 
into their own because the people in authority

30:23.678 --> 30:48.707
realized at that time that a reservist could be 
trained and ready to go to war and in the same state

30:23.678 --> 30:48.707
of readiness for a fraction of what it would cost to 
sustain a full-time active duty officer or airman

30:23.678 --> 30:48.707
to do the same job. So it was strictly a matter of 
dollars and cents. You can get more bang for the

30:51.312 --> 30:59.080
buck, so to speak, from a reserve activity than you 
can from an active duty activity, because they

30:51.312 --> 30:59.080
don't fly as much. Now, they don't train as much per 
month, but they train for longer periods of time.

31:04.526 --> 31:13.716
In the unit program, the flying program, where we 
have our aircraft, you might, on an active duty

31:04.526 --> 31:13.716
outfit, you might have a young first lieutenant 
that's been on active duty for a year and a half,

31:14.084 --> 31:16.788
maybe two years. He just got out of flight school, 
and he's out doing his thing. Back in the reserve

31:20.213 --> 31:26.363
unit, you might have a captain or a major that's 
been flying that same airplane for 12, 15 years.

31:28.887 --> 31:39.703
The age and maturity and experience, we always do 
extremely well in competition with active duty

31:28.887 --> 31:39.703
outfits and shoot-offs and things like that where 
they have gunnery competition. Reserves nearly

31:40.021 --> 31:44.270
always come in high or win them just outright. And 
so basically we don't do it as often, but we've done

31:45.152 --> 31:53.490
it for such a much longer period of time that that 
maturity and training really pays off for us.

31:53.774 --> 32:03.184
Okay, I want to ask you about, do you think it was a 
mistake that, and some critics have said that it

31:53.774 --> 32:03.184
was a mistake that LBJ did not call up the reserves. 
I'd like your opinion on that, but I want to check.

32:06.768 --> 32:08.990
Now, in what time period are you speaking about? 
Well, we're talking about 1965 and 66 when many

32:09.010 --> 32:18.060
people said that during the Vietnamese War, 
instead of increasing the draft, instead of

32:19.711 --> 32:28.663
increasing the draft, what he should do is he 
should use this pool of very qualified reservists

32:19.711 --> 32:28.663
and send them to Vietnam. What do you feel about 
that? I feel that he made the right decision

32:30.606 --> 32:33.670
basically for this reason.

32:36.554 --> 32:38.397
The reserves are your last resort. When you call 
the reserves, that's your trump card. You've got

32:41.361 --> 32:43.584
nothing left. Now, depending on the timing of the 
situation, you may have to play that trump card. In

32:48.533 --> 32:55.099
his situation, he didn't have to play that trump 
card due to the gradual escalation and buildup and

32:48.533 --> 32:55.099
so forth. So my personal opinion is that the 
reserve should be exactly that, held in reserve

32:55.119 --> 33:05.588
until your other alternatives have been 
exhausted. Full declaration of war then? Not

33:07.810 --> 33:08.590
necessarily. As I mentioned yesterday when we 
were talking, in my opinion, any future conflict

33:09.812 --> 33:18.439
where we really get down to it there's not going to 
be enough time to mobilize, to train, to send the

33:19.094 --> 33:29.070
tech school to man active duty outfits. I think the 
likelihood for reserve units being activated in

33:30.452 --> 33:43.934
the future are much, much higher than they've ever 
been in the history of the reserve program.

33:43.954 --> 33:46.738
There's no question that if things escalate, 
whether it's a declared war, whether it's a police

33:47.393 --> 33:54.121
action, what have you, that a lot of reserve units 
are going to be activated. For that reason, we have

33:55.923 --> 33:58.846
a lot of trouble. A lot of people know that. And for 
that reason, we have, up until the recession came

34:00.448 --> 34:10.440
along, have had a lot of trouble recruiting 
people, especially in some particular type

34:00.448 --> 34:10.440
outfits that are particularly vulnerable to 
activation. For example, an airport squadron.

34:15.288 --> 34:21.497
which is a unit that helps load and unload 
airplanes at ports of embarkation, shipping

34:15.288 --> 34:21.497
freight, and things like that. Over half of the Air 
Force's capability for that type of activity is in

34:22.639 --> 34:28.507
the reserve program. So if they surge, there's 
only one place they can get trained people, and

34:29.188 --> 34:34.857
that's by activating some reserve outfits. 
Therefore, we've had a great deal of difficulty in

34:34.877 --> 34:41.346
enticing enlisted people to become members of the 
airport squadrons. because they know that they'd

34:42.659 --> 34:45.102
be the first ones to go. Civil engineering 
squadrons are the same way. They're the guys that

34:47.505 --> 34:51.230
go out and build the dirt strips so that people can 
land in the forward group. And so we've had a great

34:52.331 --> 34:57.077
deal of difficulty in manning civil engineering 
squads. Now, I mentioned the recession. When the

34:59.019 --> 35:05.267
recession came along, the manning is in direct 
proportion to economic conditions. Anytime

35:05.307 --> 35:10.033
economic conditions are bad, you fill up the 
reserve program because it's not a bad part-time

35:10.722 --> 35:15.448
job that pays to the point where it's significant 
now. By the same token, if the economic conditions

35:15.468 --> 35:22.897
are good and everybody's vying for skills, then 
we're in the labor market like everybody else. We

35:23.317 --> 35:26.421
try to hire our share of them, and we're not always 
successful. Right now, we're fat. That's not to

35:28.043 --> 35:31.807
say we will be six months or a year from now.

35:34.110 --> 35:38.535
I was wondering about as far as recruitment during 
Vietnam. I really wasn't that close to it. And the

35:40.608 --> 35:49.536
reserves, I would have thought that many people 
would want to join the reserves so they could avoid

35:40.608 --> 35:49.536
active duty or the draft. Well, I see what you mean. 
Yeah, that's true. That's always true. And did you

35:53.819 --> 35:56.662
have that in the reserve units? Long, long waiting 
list to get in reserve units, especially the Air

35:56.802 --> 36:01.346
Force reserve units now. I understand even under 
those conditions that the Marine Corps reserves,

36:01.486 --> 36:07.771
the Army reserves really didn't have that many 
people wanting to get in a reserve program. But the

36:08.472 --> 36:10.193
Air Force has always been blessed in that people 
had rather, for some reason, had rather be in the

36:11.033 --> 36:17.542
Air Force than in the Army or the Marines. That's 
not all people. Some people prefer the Marines.

36:22.348 --> 36:27.295
But the Air Force kind of, I guess, has a reputation 
that we sleep in a warm bed every night. And you may

36:27.536 --> 36:35.927
go get shot down and killed, but if you make it back, 
you've got a warm bed and a hot meal waiting for you.

36:37.679 --> 36:42.466
How did you deal with those long lines trying to get 
into the reserves?

36:45.350 --> 36:50.177
I just really wasn't that close to that particular 
segment to comment on that. I presume that the

36:50.357 --> 36:57.688
recruiting standards, like our admission 
standards here at the university, were increased

36:50.357 --> 36:57.688
rather significantly. Now, we use SAT scores here 
kind of as a rule of thumb as our primary screening

36:58.289 --> 37:07.382
tool.

37:10.687 --> 37:17.456
The tool that, we use the same tool in the reserves 
as to what did their SAT score look like. Those that

37:18.017 --> 37:24.286
didn't take it as a percentage of people that 
graduate from high school. At one time it was

37:24.306 --> 37:29.293
somewhere down 60, 65, 70% that graduated from 
high school. Now it's up to like 98% because we can

37:29.313 --> 37:35.281
be more selective in the people we accept. So now in 
your area here in Texas, and the Air Force National

37:39.577 --> 37:47.176
Reserves, you have basically a 98% high school 
graduation. The new recruits coming in. Oh, the

37:48.619 --> 37:49.682
new ones, yeah. Right. Well, that's fantastic. 
Across the board. If you analyze all reserves, it

37:53.212 --> 37:58.758
wouldn't be anywhere near that high because of the 
carry award. But of the new people coming in, it's

37:58.778 --> 38:02.621
up close to 100% now. That's fantastic. I presume 
that once the job market improves and that there's

38:04.443 --> 38:10.590
more competition, then that percentage will 
start to drop again. But right now, we use high

38:11.390 --> 38:14.774
school diploma as a... I'm talking about enlisted 
people now. We're talking about the high school

38:17.076 --> 38:22.982
diploma being almost a necessity now. because 
most of the jobs in the Air Force are getting to be

38:23.873 --> 38:30.482
pretty technical, highly skilled type jobs. We 
don't have bitch-diggers anymore. Yeah, you have

38:33.365 --> 38:35.087
machine operators. You've got machines that do 
that. I was wondering about when blacks first were

38:37.030 --> 38:45.241
allowed into the reserve groups.

38:45.261 --> 38:49.226
In the mid-1960s, did you have any racial 
problems? None at all. I think probably the

38:50.688 --> 38:52.530
military. is the shining example of what 
integration is all about of all the other segments

38:53.253 --> 38:59.621
of our society. The military has been integrated 
for years and very successfully integrated.

39:07.993 --> 39:22.652
Not only did it happen because it was directed to 
happen, and in a military environment directions

39:07.993 --> 39:22.652
are taken more seriously than in a civilian 
environment a lot of times, but it happened

39:07.993 --> 39:22.652
because it was the right thing to happen and 
because the quality of minorities that were

39:23.172 --> 39:31.242
getting in the service earned the respect and 
support of everybody else. There was no problem at

39:31.362 --> 39:37.249
all with blacks or Hispanics or anyone else in the 
reserve program. And about what percentage of the

39:37.449 --> 39:43.637
reserves, the Air Force reserves, are 
minorities? Oh, I wouldn't have any idea, Terry.

39:46.100 --> 39:49.804
How about in the basic Texas area of the Air Force? 
There, once again, I wouldn't even make a guess. I

39:52.692 --> 39:53.994
don't have any idea. I would think that probably, 
I'll make an observation, and I have no basis for

39:55.416 --> 40:02.367
making the observation. But I would think

40:02.387 --> 40:18.272
that probably, in your enlisted ranks, that the 
percentage of blacks in a reserve unit would be

40:02.387 --> 40:18.272
higher than the percentage of blacks to the total 
population.

40:19.619 --> 40:27.586
For some reason, the black people that I've been 
associated with have a great affinity for the

40:19.619 --> 40:27.586
military. They do very well in the military. They 
make at least average and probably better than

40:31.089 --> 40:36.154
average progress in the military. In the officer 
ranks, because now a college degree is mandatory,

40:49.505 --> 40:51.367
I don't know how the percentages would compare. 
We're getting more and more and more black

40:51.527 --> 40:55.270
officers in the Air Force. But from a percentage 
standpoint as to the total population or the

40:55.290 --> 41:05.018
percentage of college graduates that go into the 
military as compared to whites, I just don't know.

41:05.999 --> 41:10.984
But I do know that there are a large number of them, 
and they make fine officers. I've noticed the

41:12.885 --> 41:18.330
number of black generals has just soared. where I 
think the first black general that we had was in the

41:19.711 --> 41:23.396
1960s. Now we have about 30 of them. Incidentally, 
I thought of a guy that you need to think about

41:27.902 --> 41:37.555
someday if he's ever on the campus or if you can get 
him, a former student who's a major general. His

41:37.575 --> 41:40.799
name is Major General Jim Taylor, T-A-Y-L-O-R. 
He's a reserve major general. As far as I know, he's

41:45.366 --> 41:49.431
the highest ranking reserve general that we've 
ever had, the former student that we've ever had.

41:53.012 --> 41:55.635
Two-star is the highest rank you can hold in the Air 
Force Reserve. And he is a two-star. And where is he

41:58.139 --> 41:59.441
located? He's located in Sacramento, 
California. He's in a real estate business out

42:02.385 --> 42:03.887
there. And he also has an interest in a winery. Not 
Taylor White. No, sorry about that. I'd just go out

42:14.579 --> 42:16.922
and float for a couple of weeks with him. He'd love 
to have you, probably. Okay, so I'm trying to

42:19.685 --> 42:24.231
expand this. But he's in this part of the country 
from time to time. If you tell him what you're up to,

42:27.555 --> 42:33.423
he may be willing to drop by and see you sometime. 
Also, there are two other brigadiers in the

42:33.443 --> 42:39.330
Houston area that would be tickled to death to come 
up to talk with you. One is Vice President of Mosier

42:39.817 --> 42:43.322
Steel Company named General Vic Thompson. Victor 
Thompson, T-H-O-M-P-S-O-N. And he's in Houston?

42:51.314 --> 42:51.975
In Houston. And he's a reserve general? He's a 
retired reserve brigadier general. He just

42:55.600 --> 42:56.742
retired last year. USAF? USAF. Right. All these 
are Air Force generals. I've never heard of him,

43:04.353 --> 43:05.915
and he's an Aggie? Yes. Yes. My goodness. He's on 
the campus frequently. Well, he's in the former

43:11.531 --> 43:13.913
student's book. Yes. I'll write him a letter 
today. The other is Brigadier General John Roper,

43:16.055 --> 43:19.878
R-O-P-E-R.

43:22.300 --> 43:24.341
He's in Houston also in the Air Force Reserve. He's 
still an active Air Force Reserve general. Great.

43:28.465 --> 43:30.106
I sure am glad you gave me these names. And he would 
be, I feel sure, willing to drive up to spend some

43:30.747 --> 43:35.951
time with you. Well, I have funds that To go to 
Houston. To go to Houston. To go any place in Texas.

43:40.393 --> 43:41.194
Good, good. Not to go to California, but to go to any 
place in Texas. And I had to go down and talk to

43:45.781 --> 43:47.924
another one. But those guys are real active in the 
Reserve Program, in the Air Force Association, in

43:47.944 --> 43:58.501
the Reserve Officers Association, and in our own 
Farmer Students Association. Fantastic.

43:59.122 --> 44:00.664
Especially General Thompson. He's responsible 
for... scholarship funds in a significant amount

44:02.555 --> 44:09.665
given in the name of the Mosier Steel Company that 
he works for. But he's in charge of several plants

44:10.185 --> 44:14.572
with Mosier Steel. He's the vice president in 
charge of operations, as I believe this is titled,

44:14.592 --> 44:19.538
and a super guy. Fantastic. I'll write a letter. 
He's on the campus six or eight, ten times a year.

44:27.409 --> 44:30.233
Well, that would be no problem as far as Houston is 
concerned. Now let's shift the conversation to

44:30.280 --> 44:33.946
women. Women, of course, have flooded into the 
armed forces in the last 10 years in the active

44:34.146 --> 44:39.754
branch. And it looks like I read a statement by the 
Department of Defense in which they're going to

44:40.616 --> 44:51.052
continue and even increase the percentage of 
women in the armed forces. What impact has that had

44:51.472 --> 44:53.335
on the reserves? We've had a number of women that 
have come into the reserve program in

44:54.850 --> 45:07.144
traditionally male

44:54.850 --> 45:07.144
specialties, primarily in the maintenance area. 
Normally you'd think of an aircraft maintenance

45:07.164 --> 45:15.333
type as being a male, but we have a number of them 
that are training. They're proficient. They do an

45:18.337 --> 45:19.778
extremely good job.

45:23.102 --> 45:23.963
When I say a number, I don't think that the 
percentage is just real high. But as far as I know,

45:28.253 --> 45:37.745
they're being recruited and trained and used in 
just about every career field I can think of in the

45:28.253 --> 45:37.745
Air Force. What about attitudes?

45:41.590 --> 45:52.363
I would say that initially, there's some 
resistance on the part of the male members of the

45:41.590 --> 45:52.363
reserve program But that lasts a very short period 
of time, 30, 60, 90 days. Then they're doing a job,

45:57.619 --> 46:01.563
and they're respected for the job they're doing. 
And

46:01.583 --> 46:11.893
under field conditions, as far as I know, in any 
exercise we've had, there's never been any

46:01.583 --> 46:11.893
problem with, you know, rapes or anything like 
that. I would say that there'd be no more problem in

46:11.993 --> 46:19.060
the military in a field exercise than there would 
be in any other exercise.
