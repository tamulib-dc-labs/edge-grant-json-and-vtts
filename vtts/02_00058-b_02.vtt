WEBVTT

00:02.714 --> 00:04.316
Obviously, I hadn't been informed.

00:04.556 --> 00:11.122
Well, one of my guys knew about it, but for some reason, I didn't get the word.

00:11.703 --> 00:16.488
So I was caught completely off guard, but it was a major incident.

00:17.328 --> 00:23.514
But it's one that should have been reported up the chain, you know, all the way, because this guy did.

00:23.555 --> 00:28.199
He had kind of a crush on this one female cadet over there.

00:28.319 --> 00:29.160
She was a

00:30.592 --> 00:34.899
I want to say a sophomore and junior, but she's a rather sturdy young woman.

00:35.080 --> 00:48.142
And he burst in the room like 2 o'clock in the morning with this rifle and a magazine over his shoulder there, I mean a magazine belt.

00:49.283 --> 00:53.190
And so she was able to disarm the guy.

00:54.672 --> 00:59.100
And he apparently was, you know, there to shoot her.

00:59.721 --> 01:06.312
She was, I guess, she'd spurned his romantic efforts or something there.

01:06.373 --> 01:08.737
But I'll make a long story to the heart.

01:08.777 --> 01:13.525
This guy was tried and sent to jail for 30 years, I believe he was.

01:14.146 --> 01:14.967
But a long time.

01:15.087 --> 01:19.651
But anyway, it was an incident where the incident system, the reporting system didn't work.

01:19.791 --> 01:24.215
But normally anything of significance, talk to John.

01:24.275 --> 01:26.758
Now, I didn't talk to the president directly.

01:27.198 --> 01:30.021
You know, John would then call the president if he thought so.

01:30.761 --> 01:34.205
Now, the provost was not in this loop on all of this.

01:35.246 --> 01:41.031
This was all through the vice president for student services.

01:41.973 --> 01:53.932
Unless there was a cheating incident or something like that, and I remember one or two of those where I acted as a dean in that case, according to the student rules, as head of the School of Military Sciences here.

01:54.473 --> 01:55.815
Cheating in an ROTC class.

01:55.835 --> 01:57.477
Cheating in an ROTC class.

01:57.698 --> 02:04.909
That was one kind of unique thing that I got involved in there as head of the School of Military Sciences.

02:04.889 --> 02:13.518
What about some, surely there must have been a few problems that in fact were humorous, goofy, silly.

02:14.800 --> 02:14.920
Oh.

02:15.721 --> 02:16.442
Here are some of those.

02:18.324 --> 02:21.467
Well, you know, in hindsight some of them are silly.

02:22.048 --> 02:24.170
At the time I wasn't so sure.

02:25.592 --> 02:30.357
My first, well,

02:31.012 --> 02:33.255
I can cite two or three things here.

02:33.335 --> 02:36.098
Hopefully I won't get too carried away here and make them so drawn out.

02:36.218 --> 02:42.446
But my first year here, it was before the Texas game.

02:42.526 --> 02:46.450
It was about the 15th of November.

02:47.712 --> 02:51.957
I get this report when I come to work in the morning that the Austin police

02:52.240 --> 02:56.245
They've just released some cadets over in Austin.

02:56.286 --> 03:04.797
They'd found these cadets, they found this one cadet who was tied up in shorts and shivering and been raining.

03:04.857 --> 03:13.609
It was chained to a wood fence or something near the tower there on the University of Texas campus.

03:14.470 --> 03:20.779
Looked like a hazing incident in that they were releasing him to A&M to take care of.

03:22.345 --> 03:27.555
Well, this was the classic haul-off that I didn't know anything about.

03:28.356 --> 03:33.125
Nobody briefed me on haul-offs, my first experience.

03:33.145 --> 03:45.147
And it was, I just reviewed that story this morning in my files, but this kid, it's common practice for commanding officers to get hauled off.

03:46.595 --> 04:07.719
They, this week before the Texas game, when everything, or a week or two, when the intensity's running high there and hype, they grab their, the freshman grab their CO when he's least suspecting it and they'll blindfold him and tie him up and take him out somewhere and drop him off and he has to find his way back.

04:07.819 --> 04:09.441
That kind of thing is what it's all about.

04:09.841 --> 04:11.623
This particular one, they,

04:11.603 --> 04:13.906
It put this guy through all kind of ordeal.

04:13.987 --> 04:29.790
They stripped him down and shaved him and put heel and sole on him and put him in a sleeping bag except his head, put him in the back of a pickup and drove him to Austin.

04:29.830 --> 04:31.793
He didn't know where he was going or anything.

04:31.813 --> 04:33.456
He was blindfolded and gagged.

04:35.559 --> 04:41.087
And he ends up over there and they tie him up to this...

04:41.641 --> 05:07.834
post or whatever it is there and drop his pants and initial his rear end and make pictures of all this and and then wave him goodbye well just at the end of this a police officer happens to notice all this and observe what's going on and you know he confronts them and they say oh it's tradition well

05:08.523 --> 05:12.890
Anyway, they get arrested, and we have a big investigation going.

05:12.910 --> 05:14.813
It makes the news, makes the newspaper.

05:15.374 --> 05:18.138
This A&M student arrested over here for all this.

05:20.642 --> 05:21.503
What happened to them?

05:21.784 --> 05:28.294
Well, the one cadet was suspended from school.

05:29.295 --> 05:30.798
As I recall, he was suspended.

05:32.240 --> 05:34.343
That's one I had to go over and brief the regents on.

05:34.363 --> 05:35.425
They wanted to know about this one.

05:37.278 --> 05:40.020
But, you know, they didn't give me any advice or anything.

05:40.441 --> 05:44.885
Now, when you were an undergraduate here, were there haul-offs of COs then?

05:45.505 --> 05:46.366
Not that I remember.

05:46.426 --> 05:47.127
That's what I thought.

05:47.447 --> 05:48.328
Not that I remember.

05:48.348 --> 05:49.549
This was all a new thing.

05:49.589 --> 05:53.932
They stole your footlocker and put it on the field, maybe at the game.

05:55.194 --> 05:56.715
But I never heard of haul-offs.

05:56.735 --> 06:00.558
But haul-offs, I found out, were a pretty common thing.

06:00.718 --> 06:03.941
And, you know, some people said this is hazing.

06:05.262 --> 06:06.103
Well, that's a...

06:06.910 --> 06:14.603
That's one that's pretty hard to sort out because the CO, the senior, he didn't really object to it.

06:14.623 --> 06:16.887
He could have said stop and they would have stopped.

06:17.589 --> 06:20.414
But he let them do this because this is a good bull thing.

06:20.434 --> 06:21.776
It's fun.

06:21.816 --> 06:25.302
It draws the CO and the freshman close together.

06:25.322 --> 06:29.830
And I've heard them go through all the arguments that, you know, the good things that come from this.

06:30.198 --> 06:39.679
And there is a lot of fun and all in these kind of things, but they get carried away and the students don't realize the danger in this.

06:41.362 --> 06:50.282
I remember another haul off, happened a different year, but this, these freshmen took or captured their CO.

06:51.005 --> 06:52.788
They took him out here to Coulter Field.

06:52.808 --> 06:55.732
They'd arranged for an airplane to be there, a little small airplane.

06:56.533 --> 07:01.741
They blindfolded him, all that, put him on this airplane, and flew him to Fort Stockton, Texas.

07:02.803 --> 07:11.796
Landed at the airport there, let him off, and he's got a, you know, really doesn't even know where he is when he gets there.

07:12.097 --> 07:14.160
And, you know, he's on his own to get back.

07:15.254 --> 07:17.017
They'd fly on back on the airplane.

07:17.057 --> 07:19.140
I guess they'd arrange to take them out there.

07:19.320 --> 07:20.562
Now those are good examples.

07:21.463 --> 07:22.265
One other good one.

07:22.305 --> 07:28.053
I get this story one morning that there's been another haul-off.

07:29.095 --> 07:31.519
The freshman captures four or five of them.

07:32.780 --> 07:36.486
Captured their CO in the evening and they'd...

07:36.938 --> 07:42.091
gone to Dallas and they had breakfast at one of the cadets' parents' home.

07:42.111 --> 07:54.222
They had breakfast and their intent was to go to Mount Rushmore in South Dakota and to photograph themselves with this senior, their CO there at Mount Rushmore.

07:56.429 --> 08:01.275
Well, you know, he's tied down.

08:01.335 --> 08:03.317
He's under control there.

08:03.377 --> 08:03.757
I don't know.

08:03.777 --> 08:05.840
It may have been blindfolded, gagged some.

08:05.860 --> 08:07.281
That was a typical thing they did.

08:07.982 --> 08:11.186
But they were headed on to Mount Rushmore.

08:11.967 --> 08:13.328
We knew that they were en route.

08:13.949 --> 08:17.733
Well, they got to Wichita, Kansas, I believe it was.

08:18.694 --> 08:22.819
And they had to stop the restroom.

08:22.839 --> 08:26.183
They stopped at some roadside park, as I recall.

08:26.973 --> 08:38.414
And while they were there, a policeman or a highway patrol stopped by and came wandering by there slowly or something.

08:38.475 --> 08:40.057
I don't remember exactly how it was.

08:40.138 --> 08:45.167
But anyway, as I recall, this senior decided he would make a break for it.

08:46.210 --> 08:47.431
and get away from them.

08:48.232 --> 08:55.221
And the police got, you know, questioned what's this all about and find out what's going on, and there they are, caught.

08:57.283 --> 08:59.045
And no money or anything.

08:59.085 --> 09:00.247
The kid calls home.

09:00.267 --> 09:09.518
He lived in San Antonio, the senior, and his parents got a bus ticket, I believe it was, for him to get on back home.

09:10.207 --> 09:16.854
These freshmen, they decided since they're already that far, they'll just go on to Mount Rushmore.

09:18.135 --> 09:20.257
And one of them lived in South Dakota, I believe.

09:20.317 --> 09:20.838
So they did.

09:20.858 --> 09:22.459
They went on to Mount Rushmore.

09:24.862 --> 09:30.447
But again, a case where, you know, there's lots of danger involved.

09:30.747 --> 09:35.232
The one with the airplane, for example, or tying some up blindfolded in the back of a pickup.

09:35.532 --> 09:37.054
You know, what if you had an accident?

09:37.454 --> 09:38.475
Just think of the

09:39.890 --> 09:46.622
Right, any sad, sad incidents that you remember during those things?

09:46.662 --> 10:04.733
Or someone was hurt or... I can't, I can't...

10:05.303 --> 10:28.999
personally recall a haul-off where there was an injury like that or I say an injury where there was a major injury I can't I can't recall one I can think of some other times when things court trips where we had accidents but not under those circumstances let's go through a typical

10:29.485 --> 10:37.878
academic year, when did the routine for you really begin before the fall semester as the Commandant?

10:38.420 --> 10:40.508
When did things get into high gear?

10:40.859 --> 10:42.861
Well, it started with the new student conferences.

10:42.921 --> 10:45.663
We were very involved with those all summer long.

10:45.703 --> 10:48.506
I used to sit through every one of those.

10:48.546 --> 10:51.689
We'd have an hour and a half for the core presentation.

10:51.729 --> 10:54.631
I've sat through so many of those, I couldn't tell you how many.

10:55.012 --> 10:59.736
Of course, Don Johnson's been doing it a lot longer than I have, but anyway, I'd sit through those.

10:59.836 --> 11:06.542
I enjoyed those and interacting with the parents, and it was always the same questions generally that you would get.

11:06.662 --> 11:10.866
Parents were concerned about how's my son or daughter going to be treated.

11:10.846 --> 11:12.830
You know, what's this hazing stuff?

11:13.591 --> 11:14.192
Is that so?

11:14.253 --> 11:15.495
Is that really hazing?

11:15.595 --> 11:19.162
And what do they need to bring and all that stuff?

11:19.202 --> 11:20.745
But those were good times.

11:20.865 --> 11:25.935
I enjoyed the new student conferences and it was a very positive thing.

11:26.928 --> 11:31.999
And then the first big event was Freshman Orientation Week, FOW we called it.

11:32.581 --> 11:46.692
When I came here, they told me that had been implemented a few years before and it was a period to really get the freshmen ready, teach them how to wear the uniform, get their rooms organized, walk them around, show them all their classrooms where they're

11:47.515 --> 11:57.808
classmates, all of these things, they'd have squared away, do this for a week, so the first day of classes, man, they're going to be there on time and in their seat.

11:59.450 --> 12:05.077
That was the idea, the preparation, sort of low-key, I was told.

12:05.217 --> 12:09.102
I later learned that it wasn't as low-key as I thought it ought to be.

12:09.858 --> 12:18.175
That was what freshman orientation, but a very intense time when parents are bringing their students and dropping them off and saying goodbye.

12:19.017 --> 12:25.751
I've watched all of that up close and seen how that affects families.

12:25.872 --> 12:29.419
And what about fish camp?

12:29.467 --> 12:35.957
Fish camp, we didn't really have much to do with that and didn't have anything directly to do with it.

12:35.977 --> 12:36.157
Oh, okay.

12:36.177 --> 12:39.542
But most of our fish cadets did go to fish camp.

12:40.343 --> 12:41.264
They liked the camp.

12:41.445 --> 12:48.355
I found since I first came here that fish camp is a very popular thing with the students.

12:49.076 --> 12:53.382
It does teach them a lot about being Aggies and they get into the spirit.

12:53.362 --> 12:56.287
And when they come back from fish camp, they all say, howdy.

12:56.307 --> 13:07.705
And it's amazing what they're able to teach them in that short period of time and how indoctrinated the new students become in that short period.

13:07.725 --> 13:11.290
But our cadets, most of them went to the fish camp.

13:12.552 --> 13:15.657
Then when the first...

13:16.160 --> 13:26.074
two or three days after Freshman Orientation Week, then when classes begin, what were the realities that you had to be concerned about?

13:26.595 --> 13:27.636
Retention.

13:29.999 --> 13:32.964
We even became concerned about that during FOW.

13:32.984 --> 13:33.905
Some would quit and then.

13:34.025 --> 13:41.796
I saw one kid that quit within two hours after he signed up on Sunday afternoon.

13:42.316 --> 13:52.128
I don't know the whole story there, but we'd have a few that would quit during freshman orientation week, just decide that, you know, this is not what I thought it was.

13:52.168 --> 13:57.815
I don't like all this togetherness and people telling me what to do and controlling my schedule.

13:58.596 --> 14:03.042
But I'd say retention was much on our minds.

14:03.022 --> 14:15.760
from the very first day of school because it was a big adjustment and we knew and it still happens there's a fair number that will resign from the Corps.

14:16.621 --> 14:22.650
When were the other most likely Corps dropout times?

14:24.092 --> 14:26.515
Well it started it usually

14:28.047 --> 14:52.637
declined over a fairly well the dropout rate was fairly significant the first five six weeks and then it sort of flattened out but there's a period oh I'd say late in the semester and then before the next semester begins you notice some will drop out then

14:53.579 --> 14:58.648
But, you know, to get through the freshman year, the retention rate is very good.

14:59.570 --> 14:59.810
All right.

14:59.890 --> 15:06.282
Then I guess one of the next times is the first home football game.

15:06.302 --> 15:09.949
I mean the next time of big events for you all.

15:09.969 --> 15:15.098
What was the commandant's routine for a home football game?

15:16.411 --> 15:17.553
Leave out the Texas game.

15:19.938 --> 15:25.630
Well, I remember a lot of parents and visitors rolling in on Friday afternoon.

15:25.710 --> 15:27.995
Some would come by the office to say hello.

15:28.716 --> 15:29.899
And where was your office?

15:29.919 --> 15:33.305
Over there in the Trigon, right there across from... Where it's always been?

15:33.326 --> 15:35.550
Where it's always been, just east of Rudder, but it was a...

15:36.138 --> 15:46.514
Very common to see people stop by to say hello and a lot of parents wanting to see their students, especially freshman parents.

15:48.537 --> 15:52.864
But then Friday night, all the hype about Yale practice.

15:53.333 --> 15:59.362
Saturday morning, the students are usually out there practicing their marching and all.

15:59.382 --> 16:04.771
They're getting ready for this big thing called the March Inn, which is a big event for the Corps.

16:05.912 --> 16:06.594
They like that.

16:09.959 --> 16:12.102
And the parents love it.

16:13.550 --> 16:17.914
But it consumes a lot of time getting ready for that.

16:19.576 --> 16:25.222
You know, the Corps step off from the quad, we call it, when they leave the quad to head toward the stadium.

16:26.303 --> 16:29.967
And I forget, it's two and a half hours or something like that before kickoff.

16:30.948 --> 16:34.091
So they're in formation all a good while.

16:34.171 --> 16:42.780
And then that marching into the stadium around the track by the review stand is a very special event.

16:43.621 --> 16:48.466
for new cadets and for older ones as well, but especially for the new ones.

16:48.526 --> 17:07.968
And the parents there, I've stood there on that reviewing stand and watched that and I see these parents behind me and all and you just see the pride and admiration and their interest in spotting their student and it kind of sends chills down your spine just standing there observing and being a part of it.

17:07.988 --> 17:09.810
It always did affect me that way.

17:09.830 --> 17:11.772
A very

17:11.752 --> 17:14.715
moving time, but very positive time.

17:15.396 --> 17:30.612
During all of those ten years of your being Commandant, who were some of the celebrities you remember being in the reviewing stand at a Corps march in?

17:30.632 --> 17:35.037
Well, President Bush, George W. Bush, been there several times.

17:35.257 --> 17:35.978
George W.?

17:36.238 --> 17:38.080
George W. has been there, not as President.

17:38.100 --> 17:38.761
As Governor.

17:38.781 --> 17:39.902
As Governor.

17:40.203 --> 17:42.829
He was there on more than one occasion.

17:42.849 --> 17:48.883
It seemed like every year we had President Bush at least once come out there.

17:49.063 --> 17:51.488
That was always a real treat for the crowd.

17:51.589 --> 17:52.651
Did he seem to enjoy it?

17:52.852 --> 17:56.159
Oh, he enjoyed it, and he seemed to mix very well.

17:56.941 --> 17:57.081
Mm-hmm.

17:57.061 --> 18:01.726
Students would run a clerk around the track to come over there to get him to sign an autograph.

18:01.746 --> 18:06.652
They'd start that and then others would come and it was interesting to watch.

18:06.732 --> 18:12.098
But he tried to be responsive to as many people as possible and pose for pictures.

18:12.158 --> 18:13.800
People would want to get their picture with him.

18:15.342 --> 18:19.006
But he was the one that really stands out.

18:21.669 --> 18:22.830
Let's see, Clinton didn't.

18:23.571 --> 18:24.332
No.

18:24.432 --> 18:25.093
Governors?

18:33.983 --> 18:37.347
I'd be dumbfounded if you said Ann Richards was there and enjoyed it.

18:37.528 --> 18:44.216
No, but Ann Richards did visit us one time, not on the weekend, but that was a very interesting event too.

18:44.517 --> 18:46.479
I'd like to talk about that if we get a chance.

18:47.280 --> 18:51.726
Let me just mention Rick Perry has been there, not as governor, but he's been there before.

18:52.167 --> 18:57.554
But people like that, and then we've had military leaders, four-star kind of people.

18:58.035 --> 18:59.597
We've had several of those.

19:00.037 --> 19:02.961
Any international figures?

19:03.667 --> 19:05.449
military leaders from other nations?

19:05.469 --> 19:14.078
We've had some foreign people there before, not leaders of nations, but some foreign military representatives have been there.

19:14.238 --> 19:17.922
And I presume no goof-ups, no gaffs, no accidents?

19:18.523 --> 19:27.953
I don't recall anything on review except one thing, it was just before the review is my second year here,

19:28.844 --> 19:51.915
uh we'd gone through the president we'd gone through the president's buffet that was another thing that we do on uh march in day is a football game day we go to the president i say we several of us and a lot of visiting dignitaries go to the president's buffet and then we go to the track and watch the review usually the president

19:52.115 --> 19:55.759
Most of them have been very faithful about coming out there and standing there.

19:56.440 --> 19:59.583
And from one to three regents usually come and stand there.

19:59.643 --> 20:02.086
Some of them very faithful about doing that.

20:02.466 --> 20:03.687
Sometimes even more.

20:03.828 --> 20:04.789
And other people.

20:05.329 --> 20:08.593
But they would come do that.

20:08.653 --> 20:13.097
But the second year I was here, we had finished the President's Buffet.

20:13.138 --> 20:15.780
We'd all walked over to the stadium.

20:16.301 --> 20:21.987
And as I was walking up to the track, someone came...

20:22.338 --> 20:26.904
running up to me to say, are you aware of the big accident that just happened?

20:27.725 --> 20:29.107
And I said, what are you talking about?

20:29.768 --> 20:38.780
And they said, well, the Parsons Cavalry horses just ran over these people over there and some were seriously injured and they're en route to the hospital.

20:38.800 --> 20:39.962
This was all news to me.

20:41.284 --> 20:51.838
But this was as the Corps, prior to their leaving the quadrangle, they fired the cannon over there and they had these horses with the caisson

20:51.920 --> 21:18.180
behind it for a team of four horses i believe it was pulling this caisson well these horses bolted when they fired the cannon and they took off running they had a couple of handlers on the ground but they lost control two riders on these horses and these horses bolted out the quadrangle and all these people standing around and right over there on the corner of joe rout and

21:18.886 --> 21:20.232
Rock Martin, I guess it is.

21:20.292 --> 21:29.470
There was a little island there, and this older couple was among the people in there, and this caisson horses ran over these people.

21:29.872 --> 21:35.978
And they told me they were en route to the hospital and looked very critical, serious, they thought.

21:36.959 --> 21:41.284
Well, I immediately left and went to the hospital, medical center.

21:42.064 --> 21:46.389
And I spent pretty much the rest of the afternoon at the hospital.

21:46.409 --> 21:48.311
These people were in critical condition.

21:48.531 --> 21:52.215
I believe it was the lady had to have brain surgery that evening.

21:52.715 --> 21:57.600
And we were so afraid that we were going to lose these people.

21:58.593 --> 22:06.434
And they were parents of an Aggie, not a current student, but they were Aggies, the people in their 70s, I believe.

22:07.236 --> 22:11.488
But anyway, they survived this thing, and we thought we had a...

22:12.363 --> 22:14.205
big suit or something on her hands.

22:14.225 --> 22:20.834
But it ended up, the insurance covered their expenses and that was pretty much the end of it.

22:20.894 --> 22:28.284
But these people were as battered as I've ever seen, totally blue and purple all over from the bruises on their bodies.

22:29.285 --> 22:33.831
But that one really ruined my Saturday and several days.

22:34.182 --> 22:37.909
All right, then at the game, where normally did the commandant and his wife sit?

22:38.450 --> 22:40.453
We would sit in the regent's box.

22:40.473 --> 22:45.703
When I came here, they told me that we normally have eight tickets.

22:46.685 --> 22:54.999
You and your wife, the visiting, reviewing officer and his wife, and then that's four, I guess it's ten.

22:55.320 --> 22:56.983
Then the three...

22:57.453 --> 23:22.195
colonels one from each of the services the PNS the PAS PMS and their wives so there was a block of 10 tickets I guess it was that we normally had in that box and that's the way it was for the first few years but then things changed and it became as I understood it the regents box now maybe it always had been but control shifted a little bit

23:22.462 --> 23:27.075
But it is known today, I believe, as the regents box and the regents control that box.

23:28.077 --> 23:35.678
But it seemed to me that it was mostly current regents and their families plus some older farmer regents

23:35.860 --> 23:40.687
or just former Regents and their wives and families and special guests like that.

23:40.767 --> 23:46.695
But we did have that group of seats in there that was a nice place to watch the football game.

23:46.775 --> 23:54.505
And it gave me an opportunity to intermingle with the Regents and get to know them a little better.

23:54.525 --> 23:57.089
They were mostly avid football fans.

23:57.149 --> 24:03.117
They enjoyed an Aggie win and they'd hoop and holler in there when the Aggies would do well.

24:03.097 --> 24:10.148
During your Commandant days, what did you worry about?

24:11.430 --> 24:13.192
What were your worries during the game?

24:14.214 --> 24:16.878
Did you have to worry about something that might?

24:18.761 --> 24:28.716
Well, always were a little concerned about confrontations that might come along, you know, before or after the game.

24:29.928 --> 24:31.230
in the stands somewhere.

24:31.270 --> 24:36.558
Not so much here, but other places seem to be more likely.

24:39.042 --> 24:52.542
But I guess perhaps we didn't worry enough or plan well enough because it was after the Texas game here in 95 that we had the big confrontation on the field after the game and that was nasty.

24:54.285 --> 24:54.805
Nasty.

24:56.328 --> 24:59.192
And A&M had lost the game and we

25:00.168 --> 25:20.691
been beating Texas fairly regularly over recent years but we lost that game and the Texas folks were so happy and jubilant that they poured out of the stands onto the field and waving their flags and celebrating and the Aggies didn't take too kindly to that and

25:21.920 --> 25:26.867
It ended up in confrontations amongst students down there on the field.

25:27.027 --> 25:27.748
A lot of cadets.

25:28.730 --> 25:29.851
The freshmen were down there.

25:29.891 --> 25:33.356
They thought they were gonna carry the yellow leaders off, but it didn't work out that way.

25:33.497 --> 25:35.079
But a lot of them were down there.

25:36.561 --> 25:44.853
So it was a lot of people on the field and a lot of scuffling and carrying on.

25:45.233 --> 25:48.518
All right, after the game is over,

25:49.797 --> 25:54.845
Were you able to go home or did you have a task afterward?

25:57.550 --> 26:16.260
I don't remember anything particular that night, but again, John Coleson, since he left, Malan has hosted a post-game, a little social at his quarters here on campus and invited a lot of friends and people to come by after the game.

26:16.358 --> 26:16.979
Okay.

26:17.000 --> 26:24.597
We did that some, but that's, you know, we'd had a long day and usually any football weekend is a long Saturday.

26:24.838 --> 26:28.647
And see, the average off-campus person has no idea

26:29.352 --> 26:38.988
like I used to tell people, I was so grateful for there to be out-of-town games when I was president or chancellor that therefore I could stay home and relax.

26:39.008 --> 26:41.632
All right, for out of, how often did you go to out-of-town games?

26:42.153 --> 26:43.035
I made most of them.

26:43.135 --> 26:44.938
I made most of the games.

26:46.060 --> 26:47.562
And we were still doing court trips?

26:47.823 --> 26:48.043
Yes.

26:48.484 --> 26:48.844
In those?

26:49.666 --> 26:52.170
And I, you didn't actually,

26:52.150 --> 26:54.914
Was there a viewing stand for a court trip?

26:55.014 --> 26:55.275
Yes.

26:55.796 --> 27:03.908
Which towns on the court trips were the best and which were the worst for court trips?

27:03.928 --> 27:06.712
It's hard to say one is best and one is worst.

27:07.233 --> 27:12.962
They were all good and the local A&M clubs normally supported us when we'd go.

27:13.763 --> 27:16.307
We used to Houston when we'd play rice.

27:16.367 --> 27:20.453
Houston, Austin, Fort Worth, Dallas.

27:20.433 --> 27:25.258
Later, we did make a trip or two to San Antonio on special bowl games and all.

27:26.520 --> 27:29.803
But the four big cities were the normal court trips.

27:29.823 --> 27:30.884
We'd do two a year.

27:31.725 --> 27:36.731
And the local A&M club would get the parade permit for us and insurance, which cost some money.

27:37.652 --> 27:40.395
And we'd have an area marked off.

27:40.435 --> 27:45.260
And they'd provide some kind of a trailer or platform for reviewing stand.

27:45.340 --> 27:48.904
And they were kind of the host for this thing.

27:48.884 --> 27:57.699
Sometimes they would invite a local figure or someone to be the reviewing officer, but a lot of times it ended up me, which is fine.

27:57.760 --> 27:58.621
I enjoyed doing that.

27:59.062 --> 28:10.241
But it was nice to have these folks from that area on the review stand, and the Corps marching down the street always seemed to drag up a pretty big crowd, sometimes bigger than others.

28:12.365 --> 28:13.407
But...

28:13.387 --> 28:18.173
And the cadets would all come to this, pretty much all of them.

28:18.213 --> 28:21.757
It was pretty much a requirement that you show up for the court trip.

28:22.638 --> 28:26.703
And the outfit had to try to help arrange transportation among the students.

28:30.408 --> 28:36.375
But one thing I learned that disappointed me, a lot of times the students, the cadets, wouldn't stay for the ball game.

28:36.495 --> 28:37.757
They'd go to the parade.

28:38.750 --> 28:43.877
But when I checked into that, and that didn't seem to jive with what I remembered as a student.

28:43.897 --> 28:44.918
We went to the games.

28:45.619 --> 28:49.484
The core supporting the team was a big deal in my time.

28:50.805 --> 28:57.514
And now I note that students may or may not stay for a ball game after the quarter.

28:57.654 --> 28:58.375
Most of them don't.

28:58.775 --> 29:00.337
But there's some other factors too.

29:00.398 --> 29:01.299
The cost of a ticket.

29:01.539 --> 29:04.743
Getting a ticket in the visiting city is not so easy.

29:06.105 --> 29:07.086
To go to Austin.

29:08.230 --> 29:20.055
to sit over in the high corner, be ridiculed and thrown beer bottles and other things at you, and the cost of the tickets and all, it's pretty significant.

29:20.897 --> 29:23.603
So there's some other factors today, I think.

29:25.627 --> 29:27.471
But students will go to that,

29:27.620 --> 29:52.665
court trip and they'll they'll make a good show and the crowd seemed to enjoy it and it's an opportunity to socialize some on the review stand and sometimes we'd have a reception or brunch or something before the game at one of the hotels or something but those were good times for the Corps and cadets they enjoyed them all right then I guess another event related to all this is bonfire

29:53.303 --> 29:57.902
How had Bonfire changed, if any, during your 30-year absence?

29:58.725 --> 30:03.685
Well, it had gotten much bigger, humongous, in fact.

30:03.901 --> 30:05.643
Nothing like I remember.

30:05.803 --> 30:10.069
The time to build it had lengthened the way out.

30:10.249 --> 30:22.264
I remember when I came here, we rode the bus out to Lubbock to the Texas Tech game, which was the fourth game of the season, I believe, late September or 1st of October, about that period.

30:22.985 --> 30:30.735
But I remember riding back on the bus one of those trips and looking out there, and they'd stacked all these logs that weekend out on the...

30:31.137 --> 30:35.903
on the bonfire site, you know, they'd already been out and cutting and hauling in logs.

30:36.364 --> 30:38.546
So the bonfire was well underway.

30:40.329 --> 30:45.175
And they kept wanting to move it up a little more, have to get a little earlier start each year.

30:45.295 --> 30:48.058
And there were some press, well, let's don't move it up too much.

30:48.159 --> 30:54.006
But anyway, bonfire had become essentially an entire fall

30:54.222 --> 30:57.308
operation lasted all that time.

30:57.729 --> 31:03.501
And, of course, the height and number of logs and all that much greater.

31:03.622 --> 31:06.007
And when I was here, it was on the drill field.

31:06.367 --> 31:10.476
Then it moved to Duncan Field and then over to the...
