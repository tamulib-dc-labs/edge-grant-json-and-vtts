WEBVTT

00:02.933 --> 00:06.117
going to one of his dinner parties. Well, they were 
regular, you know, people coming that were in the

00:06.297 --> 00:12.946
publishing business that had been his friends 
over the years. And these were just marvelous

00:13.546 --> 00:16.911
people that get into publishing business. 
They're like Frank. They had good associations

00:18.192 --> 00:23.319
and experiences, you know, and they're very 
verbal. And, um, uh, Rosemary was a wonderful

00:24.300 --> 00:30.328
hostess in that born house. And, um, It was just our 
privilege to spend evenings over there with them

00:32.161 --> 00:39.549
and their guests. And with Mrs.

00:45.335 --> 00:48.198
I got my son-in-law's book written. But I'm trying 
to think of the... We're back on. Okay. Even the

00:54.845 --> 00:59.370
people that Frank hired were talented and 
interesting people. And I enjoyed their

01:00.011 --> 01:01.392
friendship. And, of course, I'm real proud that 
they have their own building and that John

01:02.283 --> 01:10.472
Lindsay's name is on it because he preserved it. 
And do you think John will get the railroad moved? I

01:14.556 --> 01:15.056
don't know. I don't know. That one's going to take a 
long time. Also, in the John Lindsay and Impress

01:19.181 --> 01:27.309
building, there is a collection of Shewitt's art 
hanging all over the building. Well, I had a

01:27.329 --> 01:30.973
Shewitt's print, but I... It was a letter. The 
third page of a letter. And I gave it to Roger Miller

01:34.970 --> 01:37.674
in Cincinnati. I never heard from him. He told 
Catherine he hadn't written me. I just sent John a

01:42.080 --> 01:45.124
copy of the three pages in the letter. He drew and 
commented and sketched the bonfire being built

01:45.524 --> 01:51.993
while I was up taking care. The third page of the 
letter. He had told what he'd been doing and so

01:54.176 --> 01:56.119
forth. He sketched that bonfire and had the kids 
carrying the logs. It was perfect. and made

02:02.223 --> 02:03.144
comments. And this was the day before the elephant 
walk, but he wrote it like he talked. And I kept that

02:09.569 --> 02:12.812
letter and had it framed in there. And I'm trying to 
think. I think it's important that the right

02:14.293 --> 02:17.076
person get it. But Roger lived with me for all that 
time down there and did work for me when Jack was in

02:17.716 --> 02:26.844
the hospital and when I was down there that six 
weeks. Roger was with me. Now, he's back in

02:28.145 --> 02:29.747
Hamilton, isn't he? I don't know. I think so. Mary 
saw him at, he was at the dedication of the bill. And

02:35.192 --> 02:41.862
see, his sister, Mary Lynn, is on the staff. She's 
still there. Yes, I see her regularly. She talked

02:45.227 --> 02:55.743
to me when I was there for the dedication of

02:45.227 --> 02:55.743
the statute. There's just so many little things, 
you know, like this, events in the time. and seeing

03:00.205 --> 03:05.511
the students and knowing how smoothly that 
problem went. They never had a lot of big problems

03:05.531 --> 03:10.957
with students like they were having all over the 
United States at the time. And so it really was good

03:11.758 --> 03:20.026
for Jack that it was not a big problem with the 
student body. All right, let's close for today.

03:23.030 --> 03:29.757
And if you will, share with us in closing some 
amusing Texas A&M Williams family incident you

03:30.074 --> 03:32.017
recall? Well, I don't usually tell people that, 
but anyway, we were walking over to the stadium one

03:32.778 --> 03:46.178
day, and Jack never made demands on me. He just told 
me to do something like drive to Atlanta and pick up

03:46.198 --> 03:52.087
a camper, or go take care of my mother while she's in 
the hospital. I volunteered, but he was always

03:53.088 --> 03:58.917
telling me what to do, and just do this and do that, 
because he just thought that you can't. But this

03:59.521 --> 04:02.806
day, he said, there's something I'm going to have 
to ask you today. And I had no idea what was coming.

04:07.092 --> 04:09.936
And he said, I would like for you to learn the school 
song. He didn't realize he had never heard me sing.

04:17.026 --> 04:18.388
I can't carry a tune. I made no comment when he said 
it. And he didn't mention it again. And I gather

04:25.739 --> 04:28.323
that you didn't learn it. I did learn to sing. I have 
dark tissue for eardrums. I did not hear all the

04:32.513 --> 04:34.057
sounds. So you didn't sing it later? I don't 
remember. Because it didn't offend me, and I

04:39.889 --> 04:43.877
didn't die laughing. I can laugh now, but I didn't 
laugh in his face. When we, in those days, when the

04:49.049 --> 04:56.297
rest of us would be standing and singing, would you 
stand and say the words? Probably mumble

04:56.657 --> 04:58.279
something. Probably not, since he noticed that I 
wasn't trying to sing. He was singing. You know, he

05:03.865 --> 05:06.788
was singing, but he probably had noticed that I 
wasn't. But anyway, that's the only request he

05:06.848 --> 05:11.113
ever made for me about my duties. All right. Let's 
quit with that. That's a good one.
