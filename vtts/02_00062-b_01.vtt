WEBVTT

00:06.410 --> 00:10.398
Now, you were in the athletic department until 
what year? Summer of 67. 67. So that's how many

00:14.747 --> 00:16.591
years? Well, it's roughly around 10. 10. Who, as on 
the rest of the campus, outside athletics, who

00:25.715 --> 00:28.879
were the people that you turned to? The teachers.

00:32.885 --> 00:36.369
Well, there must have been some key assistant 
deans or associate deans. Well, sure. I worked

00:37.231 --> 00:49.427
through the teacher

00:37.231 --> 00:49.427
first, and then the deans when it came to the 
tallying up grade points and so, and there were

00:50.015 --> 00:55.985
always kids that were sliding. One of my main pet 
guys was old Robert Cortez. I didn't let him take

01:01.114 --> 01:08.127
English for four semesters and then he made B's the 
rest of the way. And I told Dee Powell when they

01:08.147 --> 01:13.997
were, Bob was having a hard time I guess as a guard 
and they moved him tackle and he was outstanding. I

01:18.775 --> 01:30.672
said he just could not you know he got to have little 
chunks and stay with him because he was and he's

01:18.775 --> 01:30.672
down the valley coaching has been for years. Uh all 
right in admissions uh who did you work with most

01:30.692 --> 01:35.659
closely? Well the first year uh with with Coach 
Myers

01:44.707 --> 01:48.973
I don't know whether you were ever familiar with 
the registrar's office. You sent a transcript.

01:51.857 --> 01:59.728
Finally, it was illegal, but I had the people from 
the public schools send them to me, and I would

01:51.857 --> 01:59.728
carry them over there. There would be a little old 
girl who goes through, and she checks all of these,

02:01.130 --> 02:08.801
one chemistry, one biology, and so forth. And then 
those that are deviant from that, they go to Mr.

02:08.821 --> 02:13.127
Cramer. and go into Mr. Perriman's office and the 
damn things. Now, this is not all athletes, but

02:17.244 --> 02:20.849
they were in there. Stacked up. And then if he could 
make a decision, the next level, they went to Mr.

02:22.251 --> 02:29.120
Heaton. And, of course, we had the same problem 
through Ms. Mitchell if they were transferred

02:29.140 --> 02:35.770
from the junior college. Let me interrupt. I need 
to... All right, we were about to talk about Lloyd

02:36.551 --> 02:41.498
Heaton. Oh, thank you. Describe him and his 
functions and habits. Well, Lloyd Heaton was the

02:47.383 --> 02:50.527
director. I don't know what his exact title was. We 
just called him the registrar in those days. He was

02:56.295 --> 02:59.659
in charge of the registrar's office. They had Miss 
Mitchell for transfer students. Mr. Pearman was

03:04.125 --> 03:07.830
his assistant.

03:08.111 --> 03:09.152
Milton Edge. And then Jim Alexander, I guess, did 
the graduate check. He was on the scholarship

03:17.332 --> 03:29.486
committee, the admission committee, academic 
county, and the executive committee. And here we

03:29.506 --> 03:31.708
start battling it. Yes, oh gosh, I just, I know one 
time, you remember when, were you here when He was

03:39.693 --> 03:41.675
kidnapped. The guy was in his car and made him go by 
the bank and withdraw some money. And they took

03:49.242 --> 03:50.043
off. About 9 o'clock that night, the phone rang. 
They said, Elmer. I said, is something wrong,

03:57.771 --> 04:00.253
Elmer? And he said, no. He said, I just want to know 
why you did it. Why did I do what? He said, kidnap me.

04:08.718 --> 04:11.043
But we had running gun battles. Shelby and I did on 
basketball players. And I went to the conference

04:14.792 --> 04:17.639
two different times. And they were wrong. To get 
people admitted? Their criteria was wrong. Now,

04:23.872 --> 04:26.716
was Mr. Heaton, was he... He's a head stick. Was he 
comparatively... Arbitrary. Arbitrary. That's

04:33.425 --> 04:35.147
a personal opinion. That's right. All right. Now, 
by your use... Well, on this bunch, back up to Mr.

04:36.809 --> 04:42.977
Heaton. Coach Myers. I said, well, Coach, these 
kids don't meet admission requirements. She

04:50.246 --> 04:51.448
said, what should I do about it? I said, you need to 
call Mr. Rutter. And so I called the list, you know,

04:55.814 --> 05:02.224
because I'd interviewed most of the kids during 
the spring. We go up there and we're sitting,

05:04.087 --> 05:10.416
there's Mr. Heath, Mr. Rutter, Coach Myers and Bud 
Denton, and we're sitting around the General's

05:11.105 --> 05:18.996
desk there. Those were experiences that are just 
wonderful for me. And

05:24.563 --> 05:31.813
he said, what's the problem here, Bud? I said, 
well, we have some students that are late getting

05:31.833 --> 05:38.462
their applications in, and some of them have this 
difficulty. And he turned to Mr. Heaton and he

05:39.978 --> 05:45.365
said, well, we'll lose our accreditation. I can 
still see. And he turned to me and he said, well,

05:49.450 --> 05:52.114
what do you think, bud? I said, well, I think the 
kids can do the work, Mr. Ernie. He said, okay, I

05:55.799 --> 06:03.408
want their grades on my desk every grade period. 
Mr. Heaton, here's the list. Take care of it. That

06:06.152 --> 06:07.774
was it. I had my, and he gave me an exit interview 
when I left. I just, I was flattered, really. Now,

06:16.833 --> 06:20.718
Mr. Heaton predates you on the campus. Oh, yeah. 
That lady, Sarah Holmgreen, her husband's dad

06:21.719 --> 06:31.230
was, I guess, the financial man back, way back. And 
Mr. Heaton then served under many different

06:31.733 --> 06:38.723
presidents. Oh, yeah, indeed. Well, I don't think 
he was ever under a dean. And retired for reasons of

06:42.888 --> 06:46.693
age. There was no scandal or anything else. Oh, 
well, there was one case. I've got to tell you, Bob

06:53.082 --> 06:58.129
Murray was the academic... person. I can't 
remember where he was, what dorms and then breezy

06:58.757 --> 07:16.425
was in law hall and had charge of my athletes later 
when we moved to law and 15

06:58.757 --> 07:16.425
Murray called me one day. He said, Can you come up 
here? And I went up stairs. He said,

07:24.248 --> 07:27.532
You know the registrar hadn't moved into the new 
officers. That was that little building there.

07:30.897 --> 07:34.722
And he had a set of keys in his hand. He said, you know 
what these are? No. He said, these are the keys to

07:37.807 --> 07:41.952
Mr. Heaton's office. And they hadn't even moved 
in. So he had called the boy. Asked him for any extra

07:48.661 --> 07:50.644
keys. I don't know where he got them until this day. 
Some kid, probably one of his dorm supervisors,

07:53.752 --> 07:59.497
had gotten them. Some kid had come up to him and 
found them or had them. They still don't know where

08:03.361 --> 08:05.823
they came from. Out of his desk? What were Mr. 
Heaton's pet peeves? His way. Going my way. That's

08:18.295 --> 08:19.196
terrible. Knowing that, How would you and your 
colleagues, how would you all work it? Oh, I didn't

08:26.237 --> 08:27.539
work around him. I just went to his office when it 
got down to that and always carried my little

08:27.639 --> 08:35.149
handbook from the conference, you know. All 
right. Now, when you, the two of you disagreed, did

08:35.890 --> 08:41.478
he carry a grudge later? Oh, no. I never had that 
feeling. He was against the basic division for

08:43.822 --> 08:50.972
some reason because, one, I know back over the 
years, Dee and I had worked together. I don't know

08:51.526 --> 08:57.753
whether you were here or not, but we had put 
footprints to register. And I don't know what it

08:57.953 --> 09:06.262
was, but we had the scholastic officers and 
non-coms in each of the units. And they would bring

09:07.243 --> 09:14.490
them over, and we'd worked out all this mechanics, 
you know, that military type stuff. And I know,

09:14.510 --> 09:20.757
went out there, one registration, and Mr. 
Perrymore was just beside himself. He said, where

09:23.048 --> 09:26.131
are the troops? Well, we'd already finished 
registration. He couldn't believe it. In a couple

09:29.294 --> 09:30.275
of hours. That was registration during all your 
years in Sabisa. Then, don't I remember, some

09:38.844 --> 09:44.730
summer registrations in G. Raleigh? No. That's 
later? I used to. pull the athlete's card, you

09:49.863 --> 09:53.649
know, they do first. And I'd always get Alice's and 
register for her all over again. Right now, where

09:58.336 --> 10:04.846
did the students eat in registration time? Over at 
Duncan. Oh, that's right. Everybody ate at Duncan

10:07.630 --> 10:09.673
briefly. Or the MSC. And am I correct in 
remembering that almost every faculty member

10:19.259 --> 10:22.624
took a little turn at registration. Oh, yeah. I 
know the history did in English.

10:29.754 --> 10:41.731
You know, it was possible, the secretaries, and of 
course there was no objection in the early days of

10:29.754 --> 10:41.731
your teacher assignment list where they had them. 
Now, math would turn up, unfortunately, with a

10:42.111 --> 10:46.718
bunch of sections that never had teachers 
assigned to them, but there were good math

10:46.883 --> 10:54.852
teachers, and if you could do those types of 
things. Who were those good math teachers? Well, I

10:58.236 --> 11:00.759
thought Jack Kent was for upper level. John 
Kinkenny. Kubrick Kent. Yeah, he'd be upper

11:08.048 --> 11:14.055
level, and I was trying to think of guys in my was in 
my church. What about in English? Oh, Sid Cox and

11:18.008 --> 11:21.913
Jernigan and Louis Hauer. Oh, they were a bunch of 
good people. Chemistry?

11:28.162 --> 11:31.066
Well, Callaway, one of the years he was here. 
Biology? Oh, Medlin Dobson.

11:36.654 --> 11:38.657
He had a bunch of graduate students that taught. 
They were superb teachers. I had a few of them as

11:40.179 --> 11:42.743
tutors later. Before they became graduates. 
History?

11:48.285 --> 11:50.928
I was partial to history anyway. I thought the 
whole department. Economics was a little more

11:54.132 --> 12:04.924
difficult.

12:05.044 --> 12:09.068
I

12:05.044 --> 12:09.068
had majored in English. Economics 203 and 4 when I 
was a student. I wish I had taken them. I did take

12:16.144 --> 12:21.310
them both over when I came back.

12:21.330 --> 12:26.615
Were you at the Aspirations Report in the early 
60s? Is that big self-study? Oh yeah, I have a copy

12:30.700 --> 12:32.181
somewhere. Alright. Did you have any... No. Okay. 
Austin will have to tell you because we just did

12:37.904 --> 12:46.836
assign tasks on Rudder's deal for the military. 
I've got a copy of that someplace. I haven't

12:48.479 --> 12:55.168
unpacked my stuff from 13 years ago that's moving 
from high school. What do you now think about the

12:55.188 --> 12:59.734
aspirations report and its importance? Well, I'd 
feel better if I knew who was on it. I don't know

13:04.381 --> 13:05.903
anybody, you know. But you know some of the 
recommendations, non-compulsory core. Oh, you

13:11.560 --> 13:13.522
mean that one back? Yeah. Oh, yeah. The fact is I had 
made a study of my class, I guess five years out from

13:15.864 --> 13:25.775
what I assumed was the normal graduation of class 
of 45. And it turned out that the girls in the family

13:26.536 --> 13:33.443
outnumbered the boys 3-2.

13:36.207 --> 13:39.473
There were some later high-powered guys in there. 
Of course, they're nuts. Some of these Aggies, you

13:41.717 --> 13:44.982
know, they just get carried away. I was listening 
to Hall, and I knew him back when he was a freshman.

13:49.571 --> 13:58.907
These stories that if people evaluate A&M on those 
stories...

13:59.225 --> 14:00.867
Anyway. All right, let's see. Then let's go back to 
athletics. Myers, then Fulberg. Which coach, all

14:10.539 --> 14:21.972
the coaches you worked with, the football 
coaches, Bryant, Myers, Fulberg, Stallings. I

14:21.992 --> 14:23.754
was two years with Gene. All right. Describe, you 
mentioned Myers. Well, Hank had been my roommate.

14:30.292 --> 14:32.576
when we were here at A&E. He went into service after 
I did and I guess Blake was head stick at West Point.

14:44.459 --> 14:48.486
He picked up him and Yeoman and Youngfold there. 
They were all here. Yeah, make believe I didn't

14:50.328 --> 14:52.752
know this Fulberg. Tell me his name and where he was 
from. Henry Fulberg, Oak Cliff, Dallas. Played at

14:57.619 --> 14:58.841
Sunset. Sunset Bison. I used to go with his sister. 
So we were, you know. But I was disappointed he

15:04.369 --> 15:11.399
didn't have a strong coaching staff. Old Craig was 
probably the... The best one. He was a PhD in

15:18.145 --> 15:19.928
history. Like Jones, you know, from Colgate. I do. 
I had forgotten that. Oh yeah.

15:28.462 --> 15:30.525
We still correspond.

15:32.208 --> 15:42.705
The fact is, when we were recruiting, when Hank was 
here, we'd have these Pennsylvania kids and their

15:32.208 --> 15:42.705
parents, when they came out, they'd come out here 
and we'd have supper and everything. And I,

15:43.057 --> 15:45.720
Liptack, does that rank? Yeah, John Liptack. I 
don't think he played much football, but he's a big

15:48.583 --> 15:52.547
wheel down in Houston. Were, was Coach Fulberg 
different from the others in his academic

15:52.967 --> 15:59.113
concerns? Oh no, he was strong academically. In 
fact, he was the one, really when you get down to it,

16:01.336 --> 16:06.721
that made the big changes in athletics. We 
centralized the housing, centralized the food,

16:11.947 --> 16:16.271
you know, if you weren't in season, you were just 
kind of, and he didn't buy it. And this one, going to

16:17.653 --> 16:21.937
class. We had a bad situation over there, and of 
course Hoyle had already gone many years, but Hart

16:22.457 --> 16:34.369
Hall had always been a sinkhole, really. And he 
went over there, pulled a surprise inspection,

16:34.389 --> 16:41.076
his head athletic director, He was most 
displeased in lunch that day. He told him that he

16:45.350 --> 16:47.999
would be back there at 1 o'clock. That place better 
be spotless. He went back at 1 o'clock, and it was

16:52.126 --> 16:55.572
fun. Now, who lived in Henderson and who lived in 
Hart Hall? Football, basically, and the top kids

16:59.579 --> 17:04.067
of basketball. In Henderson? In Henderson. And 
all other sports? Over and hard. And then we got,

17:08.835 --> 17:11.940
later on, we got part of law. And there were almost, 
oh, married athletes. A few. Well, that was the

17:16.578 --> 17:18.821
problem. We had day students, a day student 
military unit, and then we had the Air Force and

17:18.841 --> 17:30.176
Army and HART and the Air Force and Army and 
Henderson and Law. And we got all those moved to 15

17:30.196 --> 17:37.325
right across from Henderson and Law for the 
overflow. We changed the commandant. Hank went to

17:39.668 --> 17:45.876
the commandant and he changed their drill period 
for football from Saturday, can you imagine?

17:46.497 --> 17:49.682
Moved all the drills to two. Air Force and Army, all 
four. Then the following year, when Tom Murrah, or

17:53.127 --> 18:03.082
it may have been two years later, when Tom Murrah 
was sealed with the infantry outfit, they were the

17:53.127 --> 18:03.082
top. You can't tell me athletes can't march. I'm 
not going to buy that. But they were both premium

18:07.789 --> 18:11.254
outfits. And you look back on that sort of thing, 
and it doesn't appear anywhere. Nobody will know

18:16.197 --> 18:18.661
anything about it, but it's there. Gosh, with the 
women's program, that must be a real challenge.

18:24.849 --> 18:40.011
All right, now, with the three head coaches that 
came after Coach Bryant, Myers, Fulberg, and then

18:24.849 --> 18:40.011
Stallings, they all... did not remain because 
they didn't win enough games.

18:46.665 --> 18:52.793
I wrote Jim Meyers' speech or his presentation 
that he was going to leave. I said, you know, you

18:52.813 --> 18:57.320
low-key this and leave. Well, he got up there and 
just went berserk in a sense. But they had told him

19:04.329 --> 19:06.933
he was staying. That was the bad part. Told him he 
was staying? Regardless of the Texas game. Oh, oh,

19:12.913 --> 19:13.374
oh. And then? And then Axton. Right. He had a board, 
really. All right, you're saying they. As far as

19:19.763 --> 19:21.085
you know, it was the board. Oh, absolutely. Okay. 
But it was not the president. Well. As far as you

19:25.110 --> 19:25.871
know. As far as I know. All right. Then Stallings is 
hired. But nobody knew it. Bones didn't know. Hank

19:35.524 --> 19:37.808
damn sure didn't know. Describe Starling's 
arrival and reaction and so forth. The only thing I

19:42.395 --> 19:53.110
know is that we were told to come down to the lounge 
and he was introduced here as Hank.

19:53.130 --> 19:56.255
All right, now, all of you knew Starling's. Well, I 
knew him from student days. What was the general

19:58.498 --> 19:59.880
reaction? Well, I guess the former students must 
have seen him as a reincarnation of Coach Bryant.

20:08.223 --> 20:13.330
He was only 29, and he was smart enough to keep Elmer 
Smith here with him. And Elmer was a, you know, he

20:13.350 --> 20:18.517
was that follow-a-type guy. Elmer was a coach? A 
line coach, defensive coach. He was really good. I

20:24.745 --> 20:28.450
remember sitting up when Coach Bryant was here, 
sitting up on that old scoreboard. They had a stand

20:32.007 --> 20:35.793
out there. And Elmer was checking the defenses. 
And he'd go in at halftime. You'd see the chains

20:41.802 --> 20:44.667
that came over. If it was bad. It was never too bad. 
Even in the worst days, they were excellent. Did

20:52.139 --> 20:57.305
Coach Stallings change any of the routine for all 
of y'all? All of those people were very gracious to

20:57.686 --> 20:59.888
me. They just, you know, you go through the trauma 
of whether you're going to have a job when the new

20:59.908 --> 21:06.757
coach comes in. But each one of those people told me 
right off, we need you type thing, which was, I

21:06.797 --> 21:15.487
appreciate it. Of course, I was getting up into my 
hole. 40s, you know. Let's see, and all right, now

21:21.017 --> 21:25.928
you then leave and what? Go to public schools. Why 
did you leave? Well, they had been after me and they

21:29.556 --> 21:37.013
had a lady over there, Ms. Dow, who was a widow, and 
She was ready to retire. Of course, I had a good

21:40.114 --> 21:44.841
reputation in the community, so they asked me. Did 
they pay you more money? Absolutely. $1,000.

21:47.244 --> 21:49.428
$1,000. I couldn't believe it. And I got credit for 
my 18 years. Oh, and this is what year? 67. 67. Okay.

22:01.205 --> 22:05.852
As you look back, what were the key... steps, 
decisions? Only made two. No, no, not you, but the

22:11.083 --> 22:16.911
institution made during those years, whether you 
had a hand in them or not. Well, I think first of all

22:18.112 --> 22:24.601
was the co-education. Of course, we had old boys. 
It wasn't a problem with me, but that little old

22:26.764 --> 22:37.138
brief study I made of about 100 classmates who 
returned their questionnaires.

22:40.139 --> 22:44.665
And then of course we made that study for Mr. Rudder 
about the military and the changes there. And of

22:48.850 --> 22:57.140
course being married with no children at the time, 
it was ideal for Alice to finish.

22:58.883 --> 23:02.067
They'd go during the summer and they had a few 
classes, I recall. She says not after three

23:02.107 --> 23:08.695
o'clock for the women, veterans' wives. But she 
got her degree. She was an honors student.

23:15.333 --> 23:20.885
In the aspirations report, I was the secretary and 
wrote the first part. And one of the arguments we

23:20.905 --> 23:30.885
made was that if we didn't co-educate and make the 
core non-compulsory, we said we're afraid we'll

23:20.905 --> 23:30.885
be very small and very narrow. That's right. Kind 
of like VMI and the Citadel. We may have been a

23:33.380 --> 23:34.962
junior college. Yeah. Then we said if we don't go 
through racial integration, we're going to end up

23:35.903 --> 23:40.227
in the courtroom. We didn't know about Title IX 
coming ahead in the future. Well, I think they've

23:43.870 --> 23:45.532
always been ahead. Yeah. That's one, you know, I 
don't, less does the athletics, and I just do my

23:47.133 --> 24:00.065
century and other contributions to the A&M Club, 
but I just, they do a good job. It's too big. That

24:01.156 --> 24:03.440
would be my main criticism. I think we should have 
cut off maybe a little less.

24:09.689 --> 24:16.680
If the enrollment had been capped, should we then 
have become much more selective? Do we pick If we

24:18.284 --> 24:23.350
admit 5,000 a year, do we admit the best 5,000 that 
apply? I can't buy this selective admission

24:23.390 --> 24:36.286
because I've worked with too many students over 
the years that, in fact, Billy Lay was always very

24:23.390 --> 24:36.286
gracious to me, but he could tell me in a nice way, 
no, you know. But I had several little old gals out

24:36.306 --> 24:40.731
there, straight A. They went to summer school, you 
know, that was the thing. You had to take 12 hours, a

24:44.460 --> 24:51.490
high-ranking graduate student. And there were 
many of those. How would you have decided? I don't

24:55.495 --> 24:56.056
know. The first hundred.

25:01.744 --> 25:02.665
I don't really know. You know, it's kind of like the 
Opportunity Awards. You've got less spots than

25:06.410 --> 25:09.334
you've got people. What about this man, Earl 
Rudder? How important was he? I thought he was,

25:14.335 --> 25:18.640
this stool would have been down the drain if it 
hadn't been for Mr. Rudder and then subsequently

25:18.680 --> 25:20.862
Jack Wood. Because that, you know, I've been, the 
military showed me that. Boy, you've got to have

25:25.628 --> 25:28.731
that leadership. And I remember talking to Mr. 
Rudder on that exit interview, and he said, well,

25:30.113 --> 25:33.637
what can we do about this? What can we do about this? 
Asking my opinion. I just couldn't give him much.

25:41.524 --> 25:43.608
Can you give examples of where you think Mr. Rudder 
demonstrated his leadership ability? Well, he

25:46.815 --> 25:52.568
made some mistakes, but he went out and got all 
those National Science Foundation. God, you talk

25:53.530 --> 25:55.133
about a rock. But you have to work through that. And 
you remember Zener said that everybody in math and

25:58.396 --> 26:04.562
science will take their test on Tuesday night. 
Well, Alice, you know Haskell? Good to see you.

26:10.528 --> 26:10.969
Thank you.

26:14.152 --> 26:16.674
Myers got that straightened out, too. He brought 
it to Mr. Rudder's teacher because I don't think he

26:17.695 --> 26:20.478
knew about it. And the kids were going to play 
Wednesday games, you know, the freshman. Missing

26:25.488 --> 26:27.351
their exam, couldn't take it. Get a zero. That 
won't wash. But anyway, I thought he was, I knew him

26:32.058 --> 26:44.678
personally, and I had gone, in fact, his Margaret 
Rutter's brother and I were freshmen in the same

26:32.058 --> 26:44.678
outfit. Did

26:44.738 --> 26:51.328
you work with young Ed Cooper any? Just knew him 
when he was the, I mean, the president's

26:53.146 --> 26:55.870
assistant. I always liked Ed. And what was his 
function as far as you knew? We used to call them in

27:01.477 --> 27:04.982
the Army dog robbers. Everything, like they did 
me, well, let Ed take care of it. He can handle that.

27:10.530 --> 27:13.534
And he could write, boy, and speak, you know. Like, 
I never thought that Mr. Rudder was a particularly

27:17.126 --> 27:19.249
good speaker. Oh, no. But I also thought he never 
claimed to be either. No. The first time I heard

27:23.715 --> 27:29.903
him, I was a class agent, so I was on the inner 
sanctum for about 30 years. Went over to the

27:30.824 --> 27:35.811
mid-winter conference, and he'd just been hired. 
Got up from there and said, it's my happy

27:35.831 --> 27:42.660
privilege, you know, just that old, I could go back 
to the hills of East Tennessee, and he said, now I

27:43.552 --> 27:57.913
want to make a statement here so that there won't be 
any question about your understanding. He said,

27:57.973 --> 28:05.044
these people who say that they were my freshman 
roommates were not. I went to John Talton for two

28:05.324 --> 28:09.070
years before I came to A&M. of course that kind of 
big government. Do you remember any other good

28:13.036 --> 28:16.823
rudder stories to share? No, I just never had other 
than the exit interview and one time there was a

28:16.843 --> 28:26.058
question about a boy's grades that he wanted me to 
check. And you remember Carl Swatan? I kept a book

28:31.240 --> 28:33.643
on Carl because he was trouble. You knew it just as 
soon as I... When you see some people, and that's

28:36.427 --> 28:43.538
not fair, I'm sure, but I said, boy, I better 
document this. And I did. And his dad raised all

28:44.839 --> 28:47.443
kinds of hell. Couldn't get him out. And he flunked 
Dan Davis's course. And I had how many conferences

28:52.050 --> 28:55.434
I'd had with Dan. How many absences? This guy had 12 
or 14 absences. Never turned in any work. And that

29:02.186 --> 29:03.788
was just that course. And there were others. And I 
had put all this down. Typed it out for Mr. Rudder.

29:09.734 --> 29:14.019
And he told these board members, here's the case. 
The guy is not eligible. But he tried to get into

29:17.042 --> 29:18.804
Navarro. And then he went to Clemson. Then he 
signed Crowe and got picked up stealing the

29:21.847 --> 29:27.133
playbook from the New Orleans Saints. I guess he's 
over at Huntville now, I don't know. Let's see,

29:35.352 --> 29:43.441
what are some of your proudest moments as you look 
back on your A&M years? Well, I really couldn't

29:45.003 --> 29:46.885
tell you. I was turned in, Pete Hardesty beat me out 
for that best award the first year they gave it, do

29:48.647 --> 29:54.033
you remember? Dealing with personnel. There were 
only five or four awards that year, but he beat me

29:57.758 --> 30:02.664
out on that. But just to be turned in by your 
teachers for me.

30:12.976 --> 30:17.101
And then, of course, we're real proud of our class, 
the class of 45. There was a lot of sacrifice, you

30:17.121 --> 30:23.428
will see, in Scruggs putting together a real nice 
book. Let's see, if you could go back to the years as

30:23.408 --> 30:30.279
an employee and change anything, what would you 
change? I couldn't because I don't have any

30:30.319 --> 30:33.283
insight at all for that. Okay. Just size-wise, 
maybe. All right, as we're getting close to the end

30:38.832 --> 30:48.648
of this part, now we'll go back and talk about your 
student years after a little bit. Well, I'm going

30:48.668 --> 30:49.669
to have to. Can we? Oh, okay. Okay. right give me go 
ahead give me about another 10 minutes oh yeah yeah

30:51.809 --> 31:15.673
all right do you have any personal papers or any 
other memorabilia that if you ever have any that

30:51.809 --> 31:15.673
you want to part with please give it to the archives 
at the cushing library yeah particularly if

30:51.809 --> 31:15.673
they're i've been kind of waiting on a lot of that 
stuff because we we did keep a lot of The fact is

31:16.193 --> 31:21.343
there's a little deal we did in A Company Infantry 
when the war broke out. We got together and signed

31:21.363 --> 31:31.000
this deal and we're going to meet in Dallas on such 
and such a period after the war is over. For

31:32.664 --> 31:37.813
example, if nothing else, let them make a Xerox 
copy.
