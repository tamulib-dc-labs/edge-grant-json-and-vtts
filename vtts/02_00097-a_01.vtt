00:02.714 --> 00:30.763
This is testing testing one two three four one two 
three four testing testing this is April the 23rd

00:02.714 --> 00:30.763
and I'm at 4000 Las Vegas in El Paso and I have the 
honor of recording the memories of Mr. Anthony

00:02.714 --> 00:30.763
Haddad class of 49 to begin with describe your 
family background who came from where, when, and

00:31.165 --> 00:38.815
then go ahead and just give a biographical summary 
of you before you went to A&M. Okay. I was born in

00:41.399 --> 00:45.865
December 20, 1928, in Juarez, Mexico. My parents 
were of Syrian descent. They were in Juarez, in

00:49.810 --> 00:57.460
Mexico, because at that time, immigration was 
very limited for Middle Easterners. And they

00:58.148 --> 01:05.254
spent five years there waiting for their quota 
number so they could come across. And I was born

01:05.975 --> 01:07.677
while they were waiting. And I had a sister that was 
born at the same time. They came from the old

01:12.201 --> 01:17.065
country with four of my brothers and sisters that 
were born there. Then when we moved over here in

01:18.306 --> 01:24.592
1930, I had two other sisters that were born on this 
side. So we're real international. I went to

01:27.005 --> 01:28.468
school. We grew up My dad was a peddler Started out 
as a peddler when he came from the old country

01:29.230 --> 01:40.795
didn't know how to speak English didn't know 
anything but went out and knocked on doors and

01:41.163 --> 01:43.987
peddled, got enough money to open a little grocery 
store. Where? What part of town? On the south side.

01:47.172 --> 01:50.718
Second Ward, you know, the worst part of town. He 
was there for three or four years. Then he moved up

01:55.465 --> 02:02.877
to Yandel, about where St. Clement Church is now, 
about 700 block. Had a partner and he had that store

02:02.897 --> 02:07.063
for a couple of years. And I remember when We had 
moved to 1400 Yandel, and I was, what, five years

02:08.956 --> 02:15.485
old, maybe. I used to cry to let him take me to the 
store with him, you know. And he would, and about

02:22.876 --> 02:30.467
halfway there, I'd tell him I was tired, and he'd 
put me, he was a big man, he'd put me on his shoulders

02:22.876 --> 02:30.467
and carry me the rest of the way. Then he was there 
two or three years, and then in 1932,

02:37.610 --> 02:41.094
We moved to, our home was 1400 Yandel. We tore the 
porch off and daddy built a store in front of the

02:41.154 --> 02:48.121
front of the front of our house. Now this was a 
little grocery store. Yeah, a little grocery

02:49.743 --> 02:51.404
store, 20 by 40. And that supported us for until 
1954. We had that store until 1954. I went to Lamar

03:01.535 --> 03:02.516
School. It was right there. What language did you 
speak first? You know, I think I spoke Arabic

03:08.255 --> 03:14.144
first, because my mother never learned to speak 
English. She learned a little bit of Spanish, not

03:14.544 --> 03:18.390
much, because she stayed home. You know, she 
wasn't exposed to anybody. So I think I learned

03:21.715 --> 03:23.557
Arabic first. Of course, I've forgotten most of 
it. And then I went to school with mostly Mexican

03:26.882 --> 03:34.313
people, and so I learned Spanish from them. And 
then my sisters, I think I learned most of my

03:35.069 --> 03:39.814
English from my sisters, my older sisters. They 
were all very intelligent. They used to talk

03:44.380 --> 03:45.901
school at home. Two of my sisters were 
valedictorians in grammar school and high

03:47.683 --> 03:51.688
school. One of my sisters was a salutatorian. So 
they were all smarter than I was, but these three

03:55.552 --> 04:00.638
were exceptionally smart, and I think that's 
where I learned my English. I went to Lamar through

04:01.850 --> 04:06.356
the eighth grade. Then I went to El Paso High. Now 
the student body at El Paso High then, how diverse

04:08.518 --> 04:12.423
was it?

04:15.887 --> 04:18.971
It was not as diverse as it is now, you know. Not as 
many Spanish-speaking.

04:27.078 --> 04:29.101
A few, yeah. A lot of the Jewish people were there 
because they lived right up on Rim Road and right

04:29.121 --> 04:34.008
around there. We had a good Jewish student body. 
And then us, we were, you know, I don't know, 30 or 40

04:36.812 --> 04:43.261
of us, you know. Great school, wonderful 
experience, great people. We had a good football

04:48.849 --> 04:53.476
team then, too.

04:53.496 --> 04:54.036
Finished there. The war started while I was in high 
school.

05:00.315 --> 05:02.838
Yeah, I was a freshman, I think, in 1941. So we just 
went all through high school. And then a cousin and

05:06.081 --> 05:12.287
I got to thinking about college our senior year. We 
had a cousin, Art Abraham, that played football at

05:13.689 --> 05:22.798
A&M and had gone there and talked it up quite a bit. 
So we decided to go there. Now, what year is your

05:25.803 --> 05:28.787
high school graduation? What year? 46. 46, okay. I 
was a Frog at A&M. Okay. We graduated in January of

05:32.611 --> 05:36.736
46 and went on right to A&M, you know. Oh. I was a 
midterm. A Frog, they used to call them that. I

05:41.742 --> 05:42.843
don't know what they call them now. It still is. 
It's still a Frog. Now, you had not visited there at

05:45.026 --> 05:46.788
all. Never had been there, never knew anything 
about it, except that that's where we wanted to go.

05:51.513 --> 05:55.438
Didn't know anything about the spirit, didn't 
know anything. Now, were you the first of your

05:56.077 --> 06:02.084
brothers and your sisters to go to college? No, no. 
Two of my valedictorian sisters went, but neither

06:05.427 --> 06:11.053
one of them finished. One of them got married, and 
the other one just decided she didn't want to go to

06:11.193 --> 06:15.899
college. All right, so when you went in January of 
46, What did you, you went on the train? No, we, my

06:24.976 --> 06:28.259
cousin's parents drove us. Oh. What did you take 
with you? What kind of stuff? Oh, I took, you know,

06:32.584 --> 06:35.146
mostly clothes, you know. I'd never been away from 
home. This was quite an experience. Where had you

06:43.333 --> 06:44.374
been? How far had you traveled anywhere?

06:49.299 --> 06:50.400
Yeah, Juarez. I think we went to Rio Dosa one time. 
You hadn't been to Albuquerque? No. Not to Austin?

06:55.426 --> 06:56.567
Nowhere. Nowhere. This was the first time. You 
know, I remember we were in the grocery business,

06:59.051 --> 07:03.216
and we worked it ourselves. It was a family 
business, and it was small, and so we just worked.

07:08.803 --> 07:14.830
And when I got there, and once we got into things, it 
was a surprise in my life. Did your mother or dad

07:16.212 --> 07:19.476
give you any... Kind of last-minute advice, 
or...? Daddy opened a checking account for me. And

07:28.352 --> 07:29.675
he said, spend all you want. It was a local one. But 
he would get the statement And and here in El Paso,

07:31.555 --> 07:41.150
you know, he said spend all you want anything you 
need But the first time I came home he said now what

07:31.555 --> 07:41.150
was this for? What was that for? So I I watched 
myself that you had worked in the store. Yes, but

07:47.260 --> 07:52.248
you didn't get paid Working as part of your family. 
Yeah, yeah, yeah except into you know my sophomore

07:56.733 --> 08:22.842
junior year my brother also had a store two or three 
miles on montana street away from us and he got

07:56.733 --> 08:22.842
drafted and when he got drafted my sister one of my 
sisters went and ran the store for me and so i used to

07:56.733 --> 08:22.842
go after school i used to go out there and work with 
her so i worked with her for a couple of years you had

07:56.733 --> 08:22.842
made good grades in high school uh yeah not as good 
as i should have My counselor came up to me one time

08:23.648 --> 08:29.158
and she says, you know, your IQ is 126. You've got 
the second highest IQ in the class. Why aren't you

08:32.624 --> 08:34.267
making those kind of grades? Of course, I wasn't 
studying, you know. When you went to A&M, what did

08:38.255 --> 08:41.701
you think you were going to major in? Engineering. 
why i just was fascinated by math but i had no

08:43.291 --> 09:13.146
background i didn't take any physics i didn't take 
any chemistry in high school so when i arrived and

08:43.291 --> 09:13.146
went to my first chemistry class there was like 300 
students in there and i didn't know what they were

08:43.291 --> 09:13.146
talking about you know so after about a week i 
changed my major i changed it to business okay all

08:43.291 --> 09:13.146
right describe uh you you go with family And they 
take you to the campus. Do you remember where they

09:16.261 --> 09:17.843
let you out? I don't remember. Did you have a foot 
locker already? Yeah. Oh, yeah. Yeah, I had a foot

09:24.010 --> 09:25.131
locker. And you had some clothes. What else did you 
have in that foot locker? I think maybe some

09:28.956 --> 09:32.460
shaving stuff and stuff like that, but I think 
that's all. How did you know what unit, what outfit

09:33.101 --> 09:35.904
you were going to be in? How did you know what 
dormitory? I guess we must have gotten something

09:37.486 --> 09:40.129
in the mail. uh it's been so long ago i really i 
really don't remember that part you know so

09:41.628 --> 10:05.408
describe getting into the dorm and into your 
outfit and into your room yeah well we we got there

09:41.628 --> 10:05.408
and we were roommates my cousin and i for the first 
couple of years

09:41.628 --> 10:05.408
everything was real nice you know everybody was 
real cooperative, real nice, and told us what we

10:05.658 --> 10:09.702
needed to do and all that. Of course, we were 
mid-term. What outfit were you in? A battery,

10:14.367 --> 10:20.673
field artillery.

10:20.693 --> 10:22.735
Was it in the Duncan area? Yeah. New Dorm? Yeah. I 
don't remember which one, but it was one of those.

10:28.001 --> 10:29.302
We were at the band. I think the band was above us. 
Describe how you all organized your room. What was

10:36.291 --> 10:36.853
in it? There was a bunk bed, you know, a sink, and a 
desk, maybe two. But my cousin made it real clear

10:47.963 --> 10:55.554
that I was in charge of fixing the beds, cleaning 
the room, and I did. And I think it was good for me,

10:56.475 --> 11:02.383
you know, because at home I never did anything, you 
know, six sisters. All right, how was a second

11:02.664 --> 11:10.555
semester frog treated by the sophomores and the 
other freshmen? Mostly, you know, just like they

11:10.575 --> 11:16.603
treated the fish, except they never let you forget 
that you were a frog, you know. And

11:17.292 --> 11:26.424
how did you learn about all the the spirit the 
traditions how did they? well, it just the people,

11:27.385 --> 11:44.108
you know, the people would talk about it and

11:27.385 --> 11:44.108
Yet I'd see him and hear him and you know, finally I 
you can't help getting into it, you know Where did

11:27.385 --> 11:44.108
you have to stand in line to go get your uniforms? I?

11:48.747 --> 12:15.008
know i don't everything was so hazy the first week 
or two i just did i just kind of you know imagine i

11:48.747 --> 12:15.008
know we had to get sheets and towels they they 
furnished all of that now there must have been lots

11:48.747 --> 12:15.008
of world war ii veterans this is when they first 
were starting to come come back and it was then i

11:48.747 --> 12:15.008
think six or seven thousand were were in the corps 
and the veterans were just just began to come back.

12:23.734 --> 12:24.795
We called them non-regs.

12:27.418 --> 12:32.684
How long before they lined you all up in the hallway 
and this that and the other? Oh I think just about a

12:33.485 --> 12:36.168
week. I didn't get a spanking for Gosh, I'll bet you 
it's three or four weeks before they've got a

12:39.575 --> 12:42.359
spanking. And what kind of paddle did they use? 
They used a pretty good size one. Just, you know,

12:47.606 --> 12:52.093
made out of, I guess, a half inch or something like 
that. Homemade, you know. Some of them had holes in

12:53.855 --> 12:56.158
them and some of them didn't. But it never, never 
hurt. as much as you thought it was going to, you

13:00.820 --> 13:04.747
know? And it was nice. It was nice. I'm really 
thankful for what I learned there. Little old

13:13.641 --> 13:23.418
innocent boy, you know, didn't know anything, had 
never been away from home, and it was really, and

13:13.641 --> 13:23.418
still is, I think, the best experience of my life. 
How long before you got a nickname? Oh, gosh,

13:27.331 --> 13:29.274
pretty quick. What was it? Frog head in, head in. 
Head in, head in. Yeah. Any background as to where

13:35.281 --> 13:37.805
they got the head in?

13:41.009 --> 13:41.529
Okay, okay. And do you remember any things in the 
dining hall? Oh, yeah, sure. Share some of those.

13:51.843 --> 13:52.784
Oh, gosh, yeah. The food was good. It really was 
for, you know, the college.

14:01.901 --> 14:04.784
We sat at the same seat every meal. The seniors 
served themselves first, and then the juniors,

14:06.246 --> 14:10.130
and we served them too. You know, we'd pass them 
stuff and everything. And then we'd eat. But there

14:15.936 --> 14:18.639
was always at least one of everything for 
everybody. It's not like they hogged it or

14:19.240 --> 14:20.822
anything. It was fair. But we served ourselves 
last.

14:26.731 --> 14:34.300
Then after we finished eating, if there was 
anything left, we could have anything we wanted.

14:35.381 --> 14:36.963
And mostly bread and gravy. Lube, they called it. 
And that was fun. And the food, I thought, for

14:42.430 --> 14:50.219
college and cafeteria, I mean, it was always 
seated, too. We always sat. We marched in. And then

14:53.630 --> 14:55.493
I think we just walked out, you know. But we always 
marched, everybody in front of their building,

14:55.653 --> 15:02.285
and marched in, and most of the time the band would 
play. Describe a typical day. What time did you get

15:06.251 --> 15:07.353
up? What did you do when between getting up and 
going to bed at night? Gosh, yeah, let's see. we

15:13.913 --> 15:40.495
used to get up pretty early or i would i'd get up 
pretty early usually at six o'clock or so and i

15:13.913 --> 15:40.495
still do you know we'd wash up clean up i'd fix the 
beds clean straighten out the room we'd fall in for

15:13.913 --> 15:40.495
breakfast after breakfast we'd come back get our 
books go to class come back you know i don't know i

15:13.913 --> 15:40.495
think I think we fell in for lunch, too. I'm not 
sure. I know we did for the evening meal. We might

15:48.607 --> 15:52.773
have just gone to the mess hall for lunch. I don't 
remember. But we always sat together, you know,

15:53.514 --> 15:57.940
the same group every time. We'd have lunch, go back 
to class, come back home. Intramural sports,

16:04.009 --> 16:11.359
sometimes we'd go out and play, you know, 
football, volleyball.

16:13.718 --> 16:16.882
I know as a freshman, we had PE. We had to take PE. We 
had that 1.2 mile run we had to do every day, and we

16:18.244 --> 16:23.652
had to do it within a certain time. By and large, 
where did that run? What was the route? I think it

16:28.679 --> 16:30.542
was around the track. Okay. Yeah. At Kyle Field? At 
Kyle Field or around there, maybe some practice

16:33.325 --> 16:38.713
field around there or something. Then we'd come 
home, study, and then, of course, you know, shoot

16:40.010 --> 16:49.080
the breeze all the time, you know, get together. 
Maybe the freshmen would get together and shoot

16:49.120 --> 16:57.710
the breeze, talk about what had happened, what was 
going on, rumors, you know. Now, you weren't

16:57.730 --> 17:00.553
allowed to have a radio, were you, as a freshman? I 
didn't have one. No, I didn't know whether we were

17:02.755 --> 17:04.317
allowed to or not. I didn't have one. And no 
typewriter? yeah oh you had a typewriter yes i did

17:06.706 --> 17:36.004
you took it with you oh yeah that's right i took one 
with me my dad bought me a little underwood

17:06.706 --> 17:36.004
portable that's right i did have a typewriter uh 
the uh uh the courses were there some of those first

17:06.706 --> 17:36.004
semester courses that you now realize were 
important in shaping anything well when i

17:06.706 --> 17:36.004
switched over to business the spanish the english 
the math i felt like i'd had it before you know it was

17:36.271 --> 18:02.532
all pretty pretty easy for me in the history but 
after that you know statistics and all that then it

17:36.271 --> 18:02.532
really got interesting the first that first 
spring semester did you come home for easter or did

17:36.271 --> 18:02.532
you stay there the whole spring i think i came home 
yeah how did you i used to hitchhike a lot after they

17:36.271 --> 18:02.532
told me how to do it and all that but i don't think i 
did it my first my first semester, I think after my

18:03.068 --> 18:05.772
sophomore year. Then I started, I used to 
hitchhike home. We'll talk about that in a minute,

18:09.779 --> 18:13.165
because I want to get good hitchhiking stories. 
Yeah, that was really something. And you

18:14.787 --> 18:19.796
communicated, particularly that first 
semester, did you write letters back and forth?

18:19.816 --> 18:20.537
Mostly letters. you know i didn't call much i don't 
know whether we even had a phone in the house i don't

18:20.517 --> 18:49.258
think we had a phone in the house we had a phone in the 
store because we delivered and did all that but i

18:20.517 --> 18:49.258
didn't i don't think we had a phone at home what do 
you think you told them about life at a m that first

18:20.517 --> 18:49.258
semester well i didn't tell them the truth i tell 
you i was um i was in a state of shock almost you know

18:20.517 --> 18:49.258
but uh and i came home one time and I was taking a 
shower, and my mama saw my rear end, and it was red.

18:56.912 --> 18:57.833
And she said, what happened? I said, oh, I fell, 
mama. But I didn't get, we didn't get. Did your dad,

19:03.559 --> 19:05.041
did your dad? My dad never saw it. He didn't ask? No. 
It's just how is it, you know, and he checked on the

19:08.064 --> 19:11.048
money, and you know. But we didn't, it didn't 
happen very often. It really didn't. So when that

19:17.275 --> 19:19.397
first semester, you passed everything yeah but 
you didn't do as well as you wanted to in chemistry

19:19.698 --> 19:47.950
well i didn't i dropped that my first week remember 
i switched over to business oh okay yeah and that's

19:19.698 --> 19:47.950
why i say it was so easy you know regular and so that 
first semester went well academically oh yeah

19:19.698 --> 19:47.950
yeah right you came home for the summer yeah what'd 
you do that summer do you remember um i i worked in

19:19.698 --> 19:47.950
the store okay or did i work you know i i

19:54.697 --> 19:55.739
My dad didn't need me. I think I drove a car for an 
elderly lady that was a welcome wagon. And I drove

20:03.310 --> 20:05.814
her around during the summer. All right, then you 
go back for the fall. Same roommate. Yeah. Same

20:15.014 --> 20:16.156
outfit. Yeah. Well, it was a battery. Mm-hmm. Yeah 
since Since it was only your second semester Were

20:19.983 --> 20:27.297
you treated like a sophomore or a freshman? We were 
supercharged they called it. Oh, okay We were

20:29.381 --> 20:31.024
supercharged freshmen. We had to stay with our 
class. Mm-hmm, you know, so describe the routine

20:32.968 --> 20:36.955
for a sophomore then I Well, you know what they 
called us. Should I say it? It doesn't matter.

20:42.802 --> 20:45.666
Pissheads.

20:46.988 --> 20:50.673
Well, we just kind of copied what the guys before us 
did. We kept order. We made a lot of noise. Did you

20:56.581 --> 20:59.125
ever paddle any fish? A couple, I think, yeah. for 
what do you remember anything no i don't i don't

21:02.078 --> 21:24.424
remember all right then describe the routine for 
football games by then oh boy yeah yeah gosh

21:02.078 --> 21:24.424
i don't think we marched in but we went we had to 
stand up during the whole game never sit down And I

21:25.248 --> 21:29.253
don't know whether we had to stoop all the time or 
not. You know how we used to do like this? I don't

21:31.796 --> 21:34.639
know whether we did that just when we yelled or we 
did it all the time. You went to Yale practice? Oh,

21:37.042 --> 21:37.963
yeah. Never missed. You know, that got to be a 
habit. Yeah, we had to go. We went. And those were

21:43.049 --> 21:43.810
good. And did you make any of the core trips that 
fall? Yeah. Yeah, I made them all. Where? How did

21:53.632 --> 21:58.499
you go to those Houston and Austin and Dallas and 
Fort Worth?

22:03.126 --> 22:07.272
You know, I think, was it our sophomore year or our 
junior year, my cousin got a car. And we used to

22:08.054 --> 22:09.636
drive. And when I wasn't with him, I'd hitchhike. 
Now, coming home, I'd hitchhike. Because most of

22:14.724 --> 22:18.289
the time, like midterm, Most of my exams, I didn't 
have to take my finals. You know how they used to do.

22:24.297 --> 22:25.564
Because you were making good grades. Yeah, yeah. 
And I forgot what they called it. Anyway, so... A

22:28.289 --> 22:30.031
distinguished student. Well, yeah. You were a DS. 
For two semesters, I was a distinguished student.

22:33.416 --> 22:37.302
But all the other semesters, I didn't have to take 
very many finals, you know. And he did, so I'd

22:38.424 --> 22:42.129
hitchhike home. And that was an experience. How 
long did it take to hitchhike from College Station

22:43.411 --> 22:46.696
to El Paso? You know, not that long. What route 
would you normally take? Usually I'd go...

22:57.470 --> 22:58.932
Did you go to Austin or San Antonio? Austin. Yeah, I 
think I'd go through Austin. And, you know, I never

23:03.457 --> 23:06.941
stayed at a place too long. Really had good luck. 
Did you have any memorable experiences? Well,

23:13.990 --> 23:19.516
just, you know, one time I got in the car with a guy, 
and he had a bottle of whiskey and a gun. But he was

23:21.258 --> 23:22.380
really, really nice. He offered me a drink. And the 
gun was between us, you know, like. And he drove me,

23:29.505 --> 23:35.293
I think, from, I don't know, Austin, all the way to 
El Paso. Did you ever have any bad experience

23:37.876 --> 23:40.219
hitchhiking? You know, I never did. I never did. I 
have not, in all these interviews, had a bad one

23:42.482 --> 23:45.767
yet. No, there's nothing that I remember that even 
close to bad. A few people have said, well, he may

23:50.693 --> 23:54.358
have been driving a little too fast. Or maybe he had 
a little too much to drink. Two or three of them have

23:56.903 --> 23:59.547
said, I was asked to drive. We did once for a lady. My 
cousin and I had both hitchhiked together that

24:02.251 --> 24:07.840
time, and she was wasted. All right. When you were 
leaving El Paso to go back, where was the best place

24:09.723 --> 24:14.070
to catch a ride? You know, I don't know whether I 
hitchhiked back or not. don't remember going that

24:19.718 --> 24:49.573
way i think i used to just hitchhike home and then 
i'd either take a train or a bus all right if you took

24:19.718 --> 24:49.573
the train where did you go to at union depot and uh to 
dallas okay and then go and then down okay yeah if

24:19.718 --> 24:49.573
you took the bus what route

24:19.718 --> 24:49.573
you know i don't think i ever took the bus because i 
don't remember but my my folks wouldn't let me

24:19.718 --> 24:49.573
hitchhike back in those First year or two, did you 
have any dates over there? No. No. You know, I

24:55.046 --> 24:59.832
hadn't had much to do with girls, really. And you 
and your buddies, what was it like to work on

25:00.373 --> 25:08.403
Bonfire that first fall? Oh, that was really good.

25:14.491 --> 25:15.612
We just worked. now that that's one of the first 
years y'all cut down some trees there were logs

25:15.828 --> 25:39.439
yeah they were it was a big big bonfire all right i 
remember as far as i know that's the first year they

25:15.828 --> 25:39.439
really used logs isn't that something where where 
were you working were you part of the cutting crew

25:15.828 --> 25:39.439
or the whole no i was by the bonfire you were helping 
the stack yeah yeah and it was on the drill field

25:42.490 --> 25:43.151
I don't remember. I think that's where it was. 
Probably. And about how long in weeks did y'all

25:45.995 --> 25:51.462
work on it? Gosh, I don't remember that either. A 
long time, I know. I don't know. Did you work much at

25:57.510 --> 25:58.612
night? I didn't. I think I worked mostly 
afternoons. I don't remember it being dark while

26:03.879 --> 26:06.242
we were working. Did anybody get hurt? No. Nobody 
that I was aware of, you know. Was there any

26:10.643 --> 26:15.548
drinking too much or anything like that? I never 
saw any. But like I tell you, you know, I was an

26:18.611 --> 26:21.374
innocent kid. And what did you, how did you feel 
when that bonfire was lit? Oh, gosh. It was

26:27.180 --> 26:28.080
unbelievable. I didn't, I didn't think anybody 
could do that, you know. When did the A&M spirit

26:34.432 --> 26:39.880
begin, did you begin to feel the spirit? Oh, gosh. 
You know, I think really I didn't really get into it

26:42.303 --> 26:47.410
until I got home that summer. That first spring? 
Yeah. Yeah, I didn't, because most of the time I

26:49.092 --> 26:58.786
was, you know, nervous and wondering whether I was 
going to go back. You know, but after I got home, I

26:59.587 --> 27:03.072
missed it. did you make some friendships early 
that were lasting oh yeah yeah i did not not many but

27:03.473 --> 27:25.566
i have my my senior year uh was a good friend uh jim 
stevens he's our class uh agent our class agent now

27:03.473 --> 27:25.566
and uh he's a good friend he was uh I think he was in 
the band above us. Anytime he comes to El Paso, he

27:29.393 --> 27:31.999
stops by. I've seen him last year a couple of times. 
I haven't seen him this year yet. Now, back before

27:37.772 --> 27:42.964
the war, they had a day in the spring called Fish 
Day. when everything reversed. Was there a fish

27:44.669 --> 27:46.133
day in your area? Well, I was a frog, see? So I never 
got that fish experience. Okay. Yeah, and I know

27:50.806 --> 27:53.533
they didn't have a frog day. Do they still walk in 
the gutter, the freshmen, or...? If so, I'm not

27:59.043 --> 28:00.427
aware of it. We used to have to walk in the gutter. I 
don't believe they do anymore.

28:08.731 --> 28:13.525
Who did you go to for academic advice of what to take 
and not to take?

28:19.377 --> 28:19.998
Nobody. Who were some of the, as you changed to 
business, who were some of the teachers that were

28:20.799 --> 28:28.609
important to you in business? Well, Dr. Nance in 
business was, he was a history teacher. You had Dr.

28:36.018 --> 28:36.999
Nance? Yeah. I graded papers for him. Really? 
Yeah. He's the department head that hired me. Make

28:43.467 --> 28:45.409
believe I didn't know Dr. Nance. Describe Dr. 
Nance. Well, to me, he was all business. He was a

28:52.201 --> 28:55.585
good teacher. I enjoyed history with him. I guess 
he saw that I did because he asked me after one

28:59.310 --> 29:04.977
semester with him if I'd like to grade papers for 
him, you know. And I told him yes. I don't know what

29:07.120 --> 29:11.946
it paid, not much, but it was something to do 
because, you know, I didn't I didn't get out. I

29:13.094 --> 29:13.895
didn't carouse. I had a little time on my hands. I 
liked him a lot. He was not flamboyant or anything

29:19.840 --> 29:23.564
like that. He was just a good teacher. He didn't 
smile very often, but... Where was his office

29:26.427 --> 29:30.911
then? Do you remember? Where was history?

29:36.897 --> 29:40.060
It was in one of the older buildings, you know, but I 
don't... See, when I got there, it was a Nagel Hall.

29:42.526 --> 29:44.068
I think that's... Really? I think that's the one. 
Oh, okay. The old civil engineering building.

29:47.572 --> 29:47.812
Uh-huh. Okay. Yeah. Let me turn... Yeah. There are 
some other, some people you remember in business

29:51.397 --> 30:02.912
that were... Well, there was the business cycles 
teacher, and I forgot his name. He was a small man,

30:08.238 --> 30:09.700
Drove an old, old car. People used to make fun of 
him. Gosh, I wish, and Dr. Stevenson in

30:13.665 --> 30:19.472
statistics, he taught it beautifully. Gosh, it 
was so interesting. I didn't want to leave his

30:22.255 --> 30:23.877
class, you know. That was real good. Mr. Hoyle, 
business law, he was good. Who else did I have? Did

30:34.630 --> 30:36.152
you go to class regularly? I never missed, except 
my senior year, I had an insurance class that was at

30:36.571 --> 30:45.645
8 o'clock in the morning, and I was in the non-regs 
then. I didn't get a contract with the military,

30:45.665 --> 30:53.518
and I don't know why I'd oversleep and I'd miss his 
class. I got a D, the first D I ever got. And I

30:57.884 --> 30:59.366
deserved it. But until then, you went regularly? 
Oh, yes. And even then, I did, except for that one

31:02.450 --> 31:04.793
class. How did you and your buddies behave in 
class? Pretty good. Pretty good. I don't remember

31:12.482 --> 31:14.585
anybody cutting up or anything. No, I think, yeah, 
real good. Might have been that military, you

31:16.628 --> 31:22.575
know, because I don't remember anybody being 
disciplined.
