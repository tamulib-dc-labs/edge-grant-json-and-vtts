WEBVTT

00:01.921 --> 00:11.540
and looking at Shirley Turner's dissertation, 
and there was a Swiss scientist, Giovanoli.

00:13.664 --> 00:20.397
Giovanoli spent his life studying, he's a 
chemist, studying manganese oxides. He's

00:20.477 --> 00:23.423
considered sort of the dean of manganese oxides. 
in that part of the world. And he said Totorochite

00:26.107 --> 00:29.232
didn't exist. And it was awful hard to settle that 
argument. So this Sri Lankan student that I had, a

00:35.621 --> 00:51.925
postdoc really, who was working with me on 
different projects, I said one day we ought to try

00:35.621 --> 00:51.925
to synthesize some and some other manganese 
oxides. And within a year, I think, we had

00:57.994 --> 01:03.291
synthesized totorokite. No one had ever done that 
before. We published that in Science. in, I don't

01:07.649 --> 01:14.140
know, 83 years, or a number of years ago, I'll say. 
And since then, the industry's been interested in

01:15.282 --> 01:18.829
Todoroki. And I've had interviews with some of 
them. It's a big open structure, kind of like these

01:21.754 --> 01:26.202
pictures you're drawing here. And there's water 
in the tunnels. And they wanted to make a battery

01:29.488 --> 01:32.593
out of it. When I was at Arizona State, the reason 
they were studying manganese oxide is because

01:32.793 --> 01:44.565
these little batteries that I wear in my ears here, 
they are probably manganese oxide batteries.

01:45.046 --> 01:48.569
Many small button-sized batteries have 
manganese oxides in them. But the chemistry of

01:49.350 --> 01:56.758
those manganese oxides and the structural 
chemistry is not well understood.

01:57.430 --> 02:02.924
Todoroki was considered by the industry, and they 
published on it, but they never developed a

01:57.430 --> 02:02.924
battery from it. Well, we went on, and in addition, 
we got good cooperation from the Swiss scientist

02:03.525 --> 02:11.144
Giovanni Olli. He said it's his work.

02:16.229 --> 02:34.896
and we synthesized other manganese oxides and 
then we identified them in soils from the Brazos

02:16.229 --> 02:34.896
River bottom and in other soils and they are still 
an area of sort of the forefront of our mineralogy

02:16.229 --> 02:34.896
because the crystals are so poorly formed and so 
difficult to analyze but yet Now more recently, I

02:35.247 --> 02:45.245
was finishing up a student, a Korean student, 
who's now gone back to Korea. And this is a twist in

02:46.207 --> 02:51.737
terms of research. had a Canadian student in 
class, and one morning when he was in, before the

02:52.527 --> 03:01.161
offices were open, he got this phone call. And this 
was someone from a drilling fluid company in

03:02.103 --> 03:18.990
Houston who said, we want to talk to someone that 
knows about iron oxides because we want to use them

03:02.103 --> 03:18.990
in drilling fluid, because we want to drill a new 
oil well in a place where there isn't, it was an oil

03:19.882 --> 03:31.792
well once before, but it's failed, on the tidal 
zone of Louisiana, just across the line into

03:19.882 --> 03:31.792
Louisiana. Would you be interested in that? Well, 
he's a student, and he said, to give the

03:33.334 --> 03:39.919
information to me, he said, you might be 
interested in calling them back. They gave us, I

03:40.360 --> 03:46.385
think it was $30,000 to do that project. We knew all 
along really what they needed to know about this

03:49.312 --> 03:53.224
iron oxide. And what they wanted us to say was that 
they could use this iron oxide and it wouldn't

03:54.487 --> 04:02.832
create any environmental hazard there. And they 
did some excellent work there. They spent a lot of

04:05.653 --> 04:13.201
money, special equipment, to use hematite and 
recover the hematite because you could recover

04:05.653 --> 04:13.201
it. It's a weighting material. That's what adds to 
the density of the mass of this mixture of clay and

04:14.723 --> 04:25.275
iron oxide, in this case, to bring the rocks up out 
of the oil well. And they normally use barite, but

04:25.846 --> 04:37.701
in the tidal zone, if the sulfate is reduced to 
sulfide, then that releases the barium, and the

04:25.846 --> 04:37.701
barium is a heavy metal, which is very toxic. Well, 
when we got through with that part of it, we said,

04:38.722 --> 04:46.773
well, what else is in your drilling fluid? Oh, we 
use some chromium humates. Chromium? Chromium is

04:50.798 --> 04:53.241
not a very friendly term. It's another heavy 
metal. And that student finished a certain part of

04:57.031 --> 05:10.113
that work on his dissertation, and I was desperate 
to support him, because he wanted to finish out

04:57.031 --> 05:10.113
more than that. He'd gotten a lot of momentum. Very 
diligent student, somewhat slow starter. And so I

05:16.150 --> 05:31.979
called around, and Wayne Jordan in Water 
Resources said, call our new leader out in the GUSH

05:16.150 --> 05:31.979
Center.

05:35.145 --> 05:37.028
His last name began with a Z, I think.

05:40.113 --> 05:47.526
Anyway, he said he's trying to get some joint work 
going. Maybe you could join together with him. He

05:50.973 --> 05:57.685
could handle the policy side and you could handle 
the science side.

05:58.887 --> 06:00.670
Ernie Vedlitz. You may know him. Ernie. And I 
called Ernie and talked to him. So I went out and we

06:08.167 --> 06:10.450
met him and took the student out. And the upshot of 
it was that those soils that we studied in a

06:10.750 --> 06:30.859
post-doc jointly shared project, if they have 
manganese in them, manganese oxides in them, they

06:10.750 --> 06:30.859
will oxidize chromium and make it more soluble and 
mobile. this local Brazos County soil has very

06:31.733 --> 06:41.703
little manganese in it, very, very little, and not 
much iron oxide. It would be a great place to put

06:41.723 --> 06:48.069
waste drilling fluid. Now that's not a kind of 
popular thing that people want to talk about

06:48.089 --> 06:58.939
because not exactly everybody wants somebody 
dumping their waste in their backyard, but we did

06:48.089 --> 06:58.939
find that Some soils are very bad to put it in 
because that chromium may become soluble and

06:59.459 --> 07:06.866
enter into the groundwater. And while we need a 
little chromium for our blood, for our sugar

07:06.966 --> 07:12.932
metabolism, we don't need very much. And so that 
was one of my areas of interest, but grew out of

07:14.153 --> 07:22.601
these other. Of all the research projects you've 
done, is there one that you're most proudest to

07:22.621 --> 07:28.707
claim?

07:32.737 --> 07:35.086
Well, we were first to synthesize Todorokite.

07:37.675 --> 07:41.269
Doug Ming's work on zeolites has grown into a lot. 
Several of my colleagues have worked with the

07:44.583 --> 07:55.601
Zeoponics thing and NASA and some here at A&M and 
some in other places in that development. So you

07:56.603 --> 08:07.401
see, it's not my research really, it's mostly my 
students' research, is what it amounts to.

08:11.043 --> 08:20.543
There are other areas even that are evolving now, 
but those are two of the highlights. The manganese

08:20.823 --> 08:22.006
oxide. See, there were several dominoes that had 
to fall to make that possible. The sabbatical the

08:28.002 --> 08:38.894
electron microscopy, the need for understanding 
chromium, and having the skills. I'm

08:39.014 --> 08:40.936
particularly proud of that. The work with the 
rice, we showed that there was ferrihydride in the

08:43.279 --> 08:55.933
soil where nobody else had done that before.

08:58.293 --> 09:11.973
Dr. Monroe, one of the things I've concluded in my 
latter years is that those of us who work in these

08:58.293 --> 09:11.973
complex natural systems, we rarely solve all of a 
problem. We usually bring forth our knowledge to

09:12.373 --> 09:18.582
solve part of the problem. And we improve the 
technology and the science, but We don't put it

09:26.930 --> 09:30.735
completely to rest very often. But there's a lot of 
utility in what we do. And just like that spinoff of

09:36.381 --> 09:45.032
NASA, you see, that obviously is very much outside 
of our expected area of contribution. And I was

09:45.252 --> 09:53.342
thinking, of all the projects you've mentioned, a 
whole bunch of them were not necessarily

09:45.252 --> 09:53.342
agricultural. Yes, that's right. The funding for 
your work, did you get much outside funding or was

09:57.301 --> 10:07.669
by and large most of it through the experiment 
station? I've had quite a lot of outside funding,

10:09.337 --> 10:14.763
although not as much as some others. My area is a bit 
more basic, and it's more difficult for me to

10:14.903 --> 10:25.095
attack these funds that are attached to certain 
practical problems. But the most funding

10:26.217 --> 10:36.829
probably was during the collaborative years with 
Hosner when we were working on mine spoil

10:26.217 --> 10:36.829
reclamation. and that was recognized as a big 
problem area for the state. And for about ten years

10:40.735 --> 10:49.046
we worked diligently on that and published papers 
and books in significant number. Other

10:50.108 --> 10:59.661
major funders or fund sources? Before I came, 
actually, I had an NSF grant for an instrument at

11:01.413 --> 11:06.580
Auburn. And that contributed to my program there 
and contributed to my understanding of that

11:07.782 --> 11:17.134
method, which we have available today. What are 
some of the honors that your teaching and research

11:18.135 --> 11:21.440
has brought? Well, as you know, I received the 
research award from the Alumni Association quite

11:26.405 --> 11:33.772
a number of years ago. In the 70s, I think.

11:39.979 --> 11:41.540
This is a different watch. The first one wore out. 
Really? And mine's still going. Well, you're

11:45.484 --> 11:49.589
kinder to it than I was with mine. So it'll take me a 
few minutes to give you the. Was it when we were

11:52.712 --> 11:54.994
still doing it secretly? When you did, did you know 
it had been? Yes, it was found secret. And how did

12:00.439 --> 12:02.442
you feel that day? Oh, I was, I will always remember 
that. I was strangely impressed by the fact that

12:06.029 --> 12:15.227
the director of the Experiment Station, Neville 
Clark, seemed to be interested in sitting close to

12:06.029 --> 12:15.227
me. I thought that was something kind of strange. 
And that was a great day. Now, of all the things, I

12:22.448 --> 12:27.081
was going to make some comments about 
administration. That would be one of the positive

12:27.582 --> 12:30.651
comments I would make, The awards program, these 
watch fobs are a very significant part of our

12:30.631 --> 12:39.825
recognizing people's success. And I got an award 
in Washington for collaborative work with

12:40.766 --> 12:49.540
several people in the Reclamation area from the US 
Department of Agriculture. Unfortunately, the

12:49.700 --> 12:57.752
Secretary of Agriculture, who gave it to us, was 
later convicted of crime. which I think later was

12:57.732 --> 13:00.495
maybe rescinded. But anyway, I'm still proud of 
the award. I'm sorry we had some indiscretions

13:04.140 --> 13:09.166
there at some point. Let me turn this off. But the 
awards by the Former Students Association and

13:11.870 --> 13:26.828
then the awards in the more scientific 
professional areas by our own departments, which

13:26.943 --> 13:30.829
are usually through national science 
organizations. That is well developed at A&M. My

13:34.414 --> 13:47.253
former department heads worked at it, and

13:34.414 --> 13:47.253
Runge was particularly adept at that. And that's 
quite important. A young faculty member has some

13:57.740 --> 14:04.892
some apprehensions, and of course I came here as a 
professor, but then you kind of go through that

13:57.740 --> 14:04.892
when you're new anywhere. And having an award 
system that kind of keeps people aware of what they

14:05.713 --> 14:17.453
do, and having another thing that we do here that's 
quite good, I think, I don't know how much it's

14:17.433 --> 14:21.939
being pushed today, but we worked at it quite a bit. 
And that is, whenever we get a new faculty member,

14:22.400 --> 14:27.507
we signed a mentor, at least one, to it. And that's, 
you were talking about being accepted into the

14:28.068 --> 14:36.260
local culture, and that's very important, I 
think. Did you ever think about leaving? Oh, yes,

14:41.086 --> 14:43.710
yes, I have. You know, different people have 
different views on their professions and what

14:45.277 --> 14:51.806
they want to do with them. And why am I in Texas? 
Well, some people would say one of the

14:54.895 --> 15:05.069
disadvantages of being at Texas A&M is we don't 
have any mountains, we don't have any lakes, at

14:54.895 --> 15:05.069
least not very many. And the climate is just so-so. 
But this is a good place to work with a lot of other

15:11.378 --> 15:19.149
people who like to work on creative things. And the 
fact that we don't have to be bothered with the

15:20.031 --> 15:24.497
beach, ten miles away or something, or even next 
door, and other distractions like that. That's

15:32.444 --> 15:34.948
not a problem with me at all. I enjoy what I do and 
have throughout my tenure here. I would say,

15:42.239 --> 15:50.451
speaking for a moment on the social side of things, 
The issues of the Bryan Eagle published this

15:50.836 --> 16:01.808
summer pointing up the fact that poverty is much 
higher in the abounding surrounding counties

16:01.990 --> 16:18.667
than it is in Brazos County, which is certainly not 
new, but it really emphasized what I think is a

16:01.990 --> 16:18.667
concern of mine, and I think it's a concern that 
should be a bit more of the community. And what

16:19.588 --> 16:30.900
research I'm going to try to accomplish within my 
next year, which may well be my last year of real

16:19.588 --> 16:30.900
active research, who knows, I'm trying to address 
a bit of that.

16:42.322 --> 16:57.011
In a sense, being given hard times, in a sense of 
being in a rather unspectacular

16:42.322 --> 16:57.011
environment, is a stimulus. And it's been a great 
place. It probably helps us to enjoy the people

17:02.302 --> 17:06.506
somewhat more. For you and your family, what did 
you all do for joy, fun, diversion, satisfaction?

17:16.675 --> 17:25.863
Very often with the family, we would go where I had 
formerly gone at a scientific meeting. Because at

17:26.504 --> 17:31.228
a scientific meeting, I'm an outdoors kind of 
person. almost always I'd go on a field trip. And of

17:35.029 --> 17:39.817
course I would see some of the local culture even 
though I wasn't much involved. Therefore,

17:40.498 --> 17:49.713
whenever I thought about where to go and the family 
had heard about the place, well that sounded like

17:40.498 --> 17:49.713
it might be a pretty interesting place to go. And 
one of the attributes of this focal area of science

17:50.254 --> 17:56.524
that I work in, clay mineralogy, is that there is a 
national organization that's not terribly

17:57.432 --> 18:01.497
large. It's grown from perhaps 100 during my 
career up to maybe 500 or 600 or more at this stage.

18:11.769 --> 18:17.035
And

18:11.769 --> 18:17.035
they can meet in some nice places. Whereas the 
American Society of Agronomy, of course, is my

18:18.016 --> 18:26.967
bigger umbrella organization, they can only meet 
in big cities. And so I have sort of been privileged

18:27.385 --> 18:36.022
to go to some very nice places. And then my family 
and I have gone. Sometimes they join me for the

18:38.447 --> 18:42.174
meetings, but oftentimes it's a follow through. 
Do you have a hobby or hobbies? Photography has

18:45.678 --> 18:52.785
always interested me, and I think taking pictures 
is probably the most of a hobby I have. I enjoy, as a

18:53.846 --> 19:02.615
boy, I enjoyed fishing, and when I had sons that 
were in a fishing age, we fished as a family. Where?

19:03.476 --> 19:14.807
In Lake Somerville, and once to Trinity River Lake 
on the east of here, and occasionally in

19:03.476 --> 19:14.807
somebody's private pond. But, and I have deer 
hunted a little bit, and I think my sons, perhaps

19:16.036 --> 19:24.245
one of them, has done a little of that. But I, one has 
a different view on those kinds of activities here

19:24.706 --> 19:39.883
without knowing the landowners than what I had 
when I was a rural youth in western Kentucky. So

19:40.437 --> 19:42.940
that changes the climate quite a bit. Where you 
knew everybody. Right.

19:47.265 --> 19:51.209
We're going to start at the university and the 
college and the department. How has Texas A&M

19:51.229 --> 19:59.638
changed, in your opinion, in these 30 plus years, 
for better or for worse? Well, we have really

20:00.740 --> 20:05.064
wonderful facilities. This university is, I 
think, an envy of many places. And when I travel in

20:10.002 --> 20:18.156
the USA and other countries, we have some of the 
very nicest buildings. We have some of the nicest

20:18.677 --> 20:22.504
remodeled buildings. So we've got buildings that 
were Some of them built quite a number of years ago,

20:24.498 --> 20:30.967
but they've been very well refurbished and are 
quite nice. And we don't have buildings that we're

20:31.088 --> 20:36.936
ashamed of on the campus, I would say, which some 
universities struggle with that. So I think

20:38.178 --> 20:41.543
that's one of our big assets here. And the fact that 
we're growing, there's something about the

20:42.144 --> 20:51.838
momentum, the vigor that goes with growing. Are we 
today as an institution making progress, you

20:51.818 --> 20:55.755
think? I think we're making a lot of progress. that 
we're, I like to dwell only on that, but I would like

21:01.640 --> 21:13.332
to just say that I think that we're struggling with 
how to deal with that song, and I don't know the

21:01.640 --> 21:13.332
answer to that. But I think we need to step back and 
perhaps get out of our box completely and go to some

21:14.834 --> 21:27.867
quiet places for some small meetings and think 
about how to to keep people more involved

21:28.302 --> 21:33.161
throughout their careers. You've been able to 
teach throughout your career. I think that's a

21:37.137 --> 21:38.683
great attribute. And the interaction with 
students is very important. And we should sustain

21:43.238 --> 21:47.244
that. And I enjoy that. I go to Mexico and teach a 
week every year for four years. And I'll go again

21:57.099 --> 21:58.361
this year. And they don't pay me money for that. I 
work extra to do it, but I do it because I want to

22:01.276 --> 22:09.706
interact with the students and in, of course, a 
very different soils environment, so I learn

22:01.276 --> 22:09.706
quite a bit. But even though they speak Spanish and 
I speak English, we have some interpreters and

22:10.227 --> 22:17.816
some of them speak pretty well in English. And 
that's a great experience just to interact with

22:18.417 --> 22:23.183
eager Some of them are more mature, some of them are 
professional already, and some of them are just in

22:23.163 --> 22:32.477
the senior year or so. And the same thing in this 
country. And so I think one of the frustrations I

22:34.521 --> 22:48.883
would say that seems inherent, and colleagues 
mention this to me more than any other, I don't hear

22:34.521 --> 22:48.883
much complaining, but one thing that is 
occasionally mentioned is, We don't quite know

22:49.201 --> 22:54.988
how to interact with the administration.

22:55.009 --> 22:57.632
And we have a high regard for our administration. 
This institution has done really well to put in

22:58.153 --> 23:08.526
people that are sound people in principle. And we 
have confidence in them. But we don't quite know

23:12.110 --> 23:19.919
how to deal with communication up and down the 
administrative scale, as I perceive it. I'm not

23:19.939 --> 23:21.180
going to ask the negative. Of the presidents and 
the provosts and the deans that you've dealt with,

23:21.821 --> 23:34.054
which one, to which of those would you give the 
highest grades or highest rankings? Who are the

23:34.435 --> 23:38.479
great presidents, provosts, deans? Well, part of 
that is historically datable, I think, in a sense

23:39.151 --> 23:56.957
that Rudder has to be the greatest, but Rudder 
could not have necessarily been the greatest if he

23:39.151 --> 23:56.957
hadn't been here when the university was making 
great strides for him. But we, as I see it, we chose a

23:56.937 --> 24:12.465
person, I don't know if you'd say it was a rebel, but 
a person who had somewhat revolutionary ideas and

23:56.937 --> 24:12.465
openness for this climate, and he had the respect 
of of the old ags and the respect of others, so

24:12.867 --> 24:23.063
therefore he could go forward and people were 
pleased to follow, even though they may have

24:12.867 --> 24:23.063
disagreed with him on small points. So I certainly 
have to hold him very high. Any other presidents

24:27.409 --> 24:29.853
you'd give him? I thought Williams was very 
scholarly, very much a person that we held in high

24:29.953 --> 24:38.807
regard. I was never very close to him, didn't have 
much occasion to be, although he did attend the

24:39.327 --> 24:49.868
same church that I did as I recall. And I certainly 
had a high regard for him.

24:59.406 --> 25:00.829
My predecessor George Coonsey, as a dean of the 
graduate school, I thought he was a good leader. He

25:06.404 --> 25:14.856
knew where he stood, and he communicated well with 
us, and he understood our situation. And I was

25:15.517 --> 25:22.627
sorry when he moved on, although he served his time 
well. And he's still someone who I like to

25:22.647 --> 25:29.517
communicate with when I get a chance.

25:30.357 --> 25:40.857
I have, as I mentioned to you,

25:30.357 --> 25:40.857
Kunkel as the dean was a good dean. And Neville 
Clark, I thought, was a very good, not a

25:42.305 --> 25:53.769
particularly, I wouldn't say that Neville Clark 
was the kind of guy, if you took a poll, he'd get a

25:42.305 --> 25:53.769
popularity contest. He's not quite that kind of 
personality. But he was very, I learned Neville

25:56.234 --> 26:03.469
Clark when I was on the Electron Mic Committee, and 
they ask him to monitor a decision on what that

26:03.955 --> 26:10.104
committee should be doing on some instrument or 
something. And I found out right away that he was an

26:11.326 --> 26:14.752
exceptionally good diplomat. And he was able to 
keep the committee going on a creative track in a

26:15.733 --> 26:25.508
reasonable time and not get everybody at odds. And 
that, I think, is a great attribute. And so I

26:32.105 --> 26:38.012
thought he was a good leader, excellent leader.

26:41.456 --> 26:47.603
I'm not much to raise anything but high marks for 
those administrators. Are there some

26:47.944 --> 26:54.972
opportunities,

26:47.944 --> 26:54.972
either at departmental college or university 
level, that you now in hindsight think that we

26:55.357 --> 26:58.100
missed? Are there some things that we might have 
done that we didn't do? Yes, I do. I think two things

27:03.225 --> 27:06.988
that we could do. One of them is research 
equipment. As I told you earlier, I'm using the

27:13.594 --> 27:21.702
same x-ray machine that George Kunze used before 
me. It was relatively new. But I've been here for

27:23.504 --> 27:34.189
30-plus years, and it would have been extremely 
difficult for me to get a new one. Other

27:34.658 --> 27:41.285
instruments that we would like to have, we have not 
been able to get them very promptly. And we've had

27:41.305 --> 27:43.807
to go and use them elsewhere. You can do a lot with 
instruments in other locations. But you sure can

27:48.411 --> 27:54.257
do a lot more if they're next door and you can be in 
with them daily. And A&M needs to provide readily

27:54.858 --> 28:04.227
accessible basic research instruments. Better 
as I view it and I know a lot of my colleagues would

28:04.207 --> 28:26.670
reflect that too I think sabbatical Needs more 
nurturing and it probably needs nurturing in in

28:04.207 --> 28:26.670
different ways in my case going away for I think ten 
and a half months and That was great. I made a little

28:29.071 --> 28:35.918
financial sacrifice, I guess, but I was able to get 
some support on the other end and get that

28:29.071 --> 28:35.918
together. To really learn how to use the kind of 
instrument I wanted to use, I couldn't do it in a

28:36.539 --> 28:48.851
month or a few months because the book, the 
instrument was booked heavily. I could only get on

28:49.311 --> 28:51.814
it so many hours a week. And therefore, I had to sort 
of move along with everybody else. And so having a

28:58.494 --> 29:05.442
long sabbatical of six months to a year is really 
important. And I don't know how to...

29:06.423 --> 29:15.734
Another avenue that's kind of related to that. In 
my work with the people in Mexico, I find that they

29:18.052 --> 29:21.958
have a different cadence from what we do. And I 
don't mean that in a critical way exactly. They

29:24.502 --> 29:27.727
just have to deal with a different set of 
constraints. And we really need interaction with

29:28.468 --> 29:34.738
these developing countries, Mexico in 
particular, I think. And I have wanted to be able to

29:35.680 --> 29:44.133
bring those people in for short stints. And they 
have come, some on their own, But now that's

29:46.486 --> 29:48.447
expecting a whole lot. And they could only stay 
like two weeks. And I get some support within our

29:52.218 --> 29:55.903
experiment station this summer. I got some 
support for a young woman to come for two weeks to

29:55.964 --> 30:06.299
finish up certain mineralogy on her thesis, which 
she's now finishing down there. I think we need to

30:08.142 --> 30:18.197
have some flexibility in the comings and goings of 
our faculty for Research and teaching.

30:22.963 --> 30:30.692
And I think that it has to be, it should be more 
flexible to be more effective. And there's just

30:31.613 --> 30:37.400
hardly anything that's more stimulating than 
changing environments. All right, now in my

30:38.181 --> 30:42.987
hypothetical case, you are a consultant. and 
you've been hired to give consulting advice to the

30:43.709 --> 30:52.905
department and to the college and to the 
university about its future. What advice would

30:53.305 --> 30:58.113
you give to your department about what it should 
do? To my department? Mm-hmm. In the future.

31:05.486 --> 31:09.733
Introspective

31:05.486 --> 31:09.733
meeting. with away from the local scene. And

31:15.230 --> 31:20.348
now we've done some of this.
