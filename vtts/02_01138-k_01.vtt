WEBVTT

00:01.617 --> 00:02.298
No, really. Yeah, go ahead. The thing about it is I 
have a commitment to my neighbor. Well, we're all

00:08.584 --> 00:11.127
stewardess of this earth. That's what we are. And 
God has put it here for us. And we have not been the

00:15.252 --> 00:24.181
right stewardess or the productive stewardess 
that God had intended us to be. That is correct. And

00:25.603 --> 00:29.667
I feel, as I heard today in a sermon, that... God is 
our father we are all brothers and sisters and what

00:30.288 --> 00:59.097
it is is that we can't we love our earthly parents 
sometimes they're good to us and sometimes they

00:30.288 --> 00:59.097
are not but what we learn from these people is very 
important and that's what we should carry on in our

00:30.288 --> 00:59.097
teachings is how they learn to seek the good and the 
right and how they were stewards we have to be that

00:30.288 --> 00:59.097
way ourselves and the thing about your heritage is 
that you have captured in your mind so much about

00:59.617 --> 01:13.736
your family and so much that has to do with being a 
human being in this part of the world, in Texas.

01:14.597 --> 01:17.261
Well, I'm telling you that I... And we have to 
capture it. Go ahead. When I was just a little

01:18.483 --> 01:28.476
child, I wasn't but three years old when I lived up 
back of the field at Grandpa Johnson's. I was

01:29.367 --> 01:32.009
taught responsibility. Now you take a 
three-year-old child and say, you get on this

01:32.470 --> 01:40.857
horse and you go across the river and get that mail. 
And here's the sack. Put it in it. And if you lose it,

01:43.459 --> 01:46.041
you can't ride your horse again. Well, that horse 
was my pride and joy. I didn't lose that mail. I got

01:53.047 --> 01:53.628
it. And how did I get it? Rode right up to that 
mailbox. And it was at a culvert, and there was

01:59.337 --> 02:06.064
rails there. So I crawl up on the rails, get the mail 
out, bring old Cousy right up to the side of it and

02:06.084 --> 02:17.115
put it in this sack, and then crawl back on my horse 
off of the rail. Well, I could have fallen over that

02:17.135 --> 02:27.505
ditch right down in that culvert, and they would 
have never found me for a couple of hours or three

02:17.135 --> 02:27.505
hours or however long they'd take that I didn't get 
back home. They'd be waiting for me. And I crossed

02:31.096 --> 02:32.437
that river. Would you send a three-year-old kid 
today across the street to even pick up a letter?

02:41.587 --> 02:41.928
No. And then they'd pick me up. And my mother would 
say, listen, honey, it's time to take your daddy a

02:46.192 --> 02:52.740
bucket of water. I had a little half a gallon 
molasses bucket with a lid on it. I walked down that

02:57.826 --> 03:05.553
old sandy land turning road, grass spurs and hot 
sand and everything else, but I took the water. I

03:07.735 --> 03:10.498
was taught responsibility. And then when I came 
back, my Uncle Jesse, who was an old Confederate

03:10.518 --> 03:20.527
soldier with a wooden leg, and I thought that was 
something else to see that wooden leg up there. And

03:21.227 --> 03:27.293
my daddy, Uncle Jesse, was very proud and a smart 
man And my daddy taught me a song. Donna's got a

03:30.920 --> 03:32.942
wooden leg long. Donna's got a meat skin laid away. 
Degrees that wooden leg twice a day. And Uncle

03:38.990 --> 03:45.077
Jesse just couldn't stand for me to tease him about 
his wooden leg. And he'd stomp that wooden leg at

03:45.097 --> 03:48.742
me, and man, I would sail. It would scare me to 
death. I would run like a goat. But what closeness

03:54.188 --> 03:56.310
you had. You were so close to your parents, and you 
were so close to your uncles and aunts, and the

03:56.631 --> 04:01.896
people that were there. Well, I was the oldest 
granddaughter. There was some older grandsons,

04:03.998 --> 04:09.184
but I was the oldest granddaughter on both sides of 
the family. And I mean to tell you, the slang

04:09.664 --> 04:15.971
expression is, they laid it on me. And Uncle Jesse 
said, now, you're old enough. If you can learn that

04:18.033 --> 04:21.056
song, you're old enough to learn poetry. Mm-hmm. 
And when we'd go down the lane to let the cow in in the

04:22.167 --> 04:36.485
afternoon to milk at night, we had to put her in a 
pasture and we had to go through the field to do it.

04:37.266 --> 04:38.848
And we'd bring her back. He'd teach me poetry. And I 
would have to learn it. And he would say, as the

04:48.728 --> 04:50.230
birds of flower. What kind of a bird is that? I don't 
know. He said, now you look at it, and if that bird

04:53.174 --> 04:59.021
would lie in a tree, I'd have to look at it. He said, 
now what color does it have? What kind of a head does

05:02.205 --> 05:04.028
it have? You tell me. All right. I learned little 
birds and what they were like. And when the first

05:12.759 --> 05:15.242
hummingbird I ever saw, just amused me i just sat 
down in the middle of the trail and he didn't move me

05:15.712 --> 05:43.407
for at least an hour because i had never seen a bird 
that could fly backwards as well as forwards and it

05:15.712 --> 05:43.407
just amused me to no end and the bill was longer than 
the body yeah and i just i just sat and i wondered and

05:15.712 --> 05:43.407
i watched and i looked as we came back up to the house 
he said uh

05:44.686 --> 06:10.778
learn me this little poem three years ago i have a 
secret just we feed loving and i in the cherry tree

05:44.686 --> 06:10.778
but robin knows it best because he felt so little i 
shan't tell the rest i'm a And he laid the four

06:11.365 --> 06:14.910
little somethings in it. Oh, I'm afraid I'll tell 
the secret.

06:21.258 --> 06:29.169
But if the robin and the tree don't peep, I'll try my 
best this secret to keep. Now that was me at three

06:29.189 --> 06:31.512
years old. Would you get a child sit down this damn 
time to listen at three? They're very rare. They

06:38.802 --> 06:40.224
are very rare. They're few and far between. And we 
need to go back to that. It's just because parents

06:43.787 --> 06:47.371
don't demand it.

06:50.535 --> 06:52.657
That was Ava Cox.

06:57.382 --> 07:04.390
November 16, 1986,

06:57.382 --> 07:04.390
Johnson City, Texas.

07:12.824 --> 07:20.513
I am happy for one thing, and I'm grateful. I'm 
definitely grateful. Because of the fact you

07:22.074 --> 07:35.009
don't find many women my age that are still before 
the public to be shot at. And if you don't think that

07:35.029 --> 07:42.477
would be shot at, you're wrong, because there'd be 
questions that are being banged from every angle.

07:42.642 --> 07:54.279
And I'm really not a walking encyclopedia, but I'm 
a pretty good substitute for not knowing how to say

07:42.642 --> 07:54.279
uh-uh. So we'll go from there. I don't know how long 
it's been since I have been giving tours to this

07:57.704 --> 08:10.041
man, but I think it started back in 1973, if I'm not 
mistaken. And let me tell you one thing. When you go

08:13.557 --> 08:28.073
back and reminisce and try to find Texas history 
notes that you haven't related to another group,

08:13.557 --> 08:28.073
you have to have notes. And I think he will bear me 
out on this, that something that I haven't ever had

08:29.775 --> 08:37.704
to refer to was notes. I can pull it out of my head. 
But this time, I had to go back and search and

08:40.017 --> 08:43.904
research. Now, I know most of you are like me. You 
were taught that Thanksgiving originated in

08:49.353 --> 08:54.722
Massachusetts. That was the first Thanksgiving 
the United States ever had.

09:01.274 --> 09:03.257
How many of you were taught differently? Okay, the 
first Thanksgiving that Texas ever celebrated

09:04.570 --> 09:20.111
was in 1541

09:04.570 --> 09:20.111
in Palo Duro Canyon.

09:20.271 --> 09:22.535
All right. That's something that we should be 
thankful for.

09:28.122 --> 09:29.464
I resent the fact. And of course you can call me a 
rebel. I don't care. But I resent the fact that we go

09:35.511 --> 09:44.482
past the Mason-Dixon line to have people write our 
Texas history. I think that we should have it

09:44.502 --> 09:49.388
written by people that live in this country and 
know it. Well, old Coronado was the man that took

09:50.470 --> 09:53.613
them up there. He was a Spaniard. And when he got to 
the canyon, he met a group of Tejas Indians who were

09:59.785 --> 10:04.391
very friendly Indians. And he ordered all of his 
men to have a day of Thanksgiving and thank God for

10:04.411 --> 10:24.317
having spared their lives and found a friendly 
tribe that would help to show them where to find

10:04.411 --> 10:24.317
plenty of food because they were without 
everything. 15 and 41. May the 23rd. So just write

10:30.897 --> 10:37.524
that down in your little book and say, that's one 
thing that is right. And when I was at Palo Duro

10:37.884 --> 10:44.872
Canyon this year, I saw the plaque that they put up 
there. The United Daughters of the Confederacy.

10:47.795 --> 10:50.537
And thank goodness I'm a member of that. And they 
had put this monument up at Palo Duro Canyon.

10:55.793 --> 11:01.719
stating that that was the first Thanksgiving that 
was ever held in the United States. Today, another

11:01.739 --> 11:03.540
thing happened. Have you read your paper? At the 
parking lot at Galveston, just at Pier 29, the

11:06.603 --> 11:20.656
Zavala battleship for the Texas Navy, they have 
found it. And they had a group of Boy Scouts to walk

11:25.460 --> 11:35.992
on the deck to say that they had walked on one of 
Texas' most notable battleships. Now, they were

11:36.012 --> 11:49.146
raising money for the battleship Texas to restore 
it, and they found the sister ship now, which we

11:36.012 --> 11:49.146
should be very grateful for, for our 
thanksgiving. Now, that's two things. Now then,

11:52.270 --> 11:55.433
this is your party. I, uh,

11:56.223 --> 12:21.218
I wonder if, um,

11:56.223 --> 12:21.218
if you,

11:56.223 --> 12:21.218
if you would be interested in knowing, since most, 
how many of you are high this thing here? Do you know

12:21.603 --> 12:26.830
where the first electric typewriter was invented 
and who did it? Or where it came from? IBM in

12:28.493 --> 12:31.818
Wisconsin. That's what you think. That's right. 
IBM in Wisconsin. For sure and certain, a fellow by

12:39.088 --> 12:50.344
the name of James Smathers that lives about 60 
miles U.S. Northwestern here in Llano, Texas,

12:50.813 --> 12:59.407
invented the first electric time driver. He sold 
his patent

12:59.427 --> 13:09.262
to the International Business Machine 
Corporation of New York.

13:14.450 --> 13:17.395
And that was in 1949.

13:19.670 --> 13:20.992
And he died in 1967. Excuse

13:21.112 --> 13:26.479
me. But I think that would be good for you to know 
right under here. Now, every one of us, and I know

13:32.486 --> 13:45.042
you know it, always says Texas has six counties.

13:45.322 --> 13:45.863
Texas under 69.

13:49.859 --> 13:57.406
Excuse me, have any of you ever heard of it ever 
being anything else but six

13:49.859 --> 13:57.406
flags? It was a seven. And that flag was white and 
red and green. And it flew over Laredo. And it was

14:11.099 --> 14:17.925
called the capital of the rivalry of Texas. That's 
the seventh way. That's the seventh capital of

14:20.824 --> 14:23.767
Texas. So that's just something that you can put 
down in a little book. Was it another, what they

14:30.255 --> 14:33.279
were saying, a little country? It was established 
as a republic before Texas was ever granted

14:33.960 --> 14:39.186
anything. And before Texas was ever won her 
independence from Mexico, A man by the name of J.M.

14:51.929 --> 14:52.409
Gorley.

14:55.474 --> 15:00.000
He was over here at Blanco, 15 miles south of here. 
Decided that everybody was going to New Mexico out

15:00.020 --> 15:11.877
there and picking up land grants.

15:11.897 --> 15:12.518
So J.M. Gorley lived here and went to Texline. and

15:16.732 --> 15:25.302
he took up a land there. And you can go back to the 
encyclopedia and it'll tell you that. And I got

15:29.968 --> 15:31.930
this out of the archives. He's the largest 
landowner in the United States. A Blanco County

15:38.417 --> 15:39.579
man. As look and life called us, country Hoosiers 
and hillbillies. Well, he is a good old hill man,

15:46.921 --> 15:53.127
about 15 miles from here. And he has 8,000,

15:53.827 --> 16:03.476
not 800, 8,000 heads of fine cattle. He had his own 
school, his own post office, his own church, and

16:03.496 --> 16:08.981
his own commissary. Larger than the King Ranch, 
Texas. Came from Blanco County. Shoot again. Tell

16:19.330 --> 16:25.003
me a little bit about what it was like for you when 
you were going up there. Oh, that was rough. No, we

16:26.787 --> 16:28.471
had no electricity. We didn't have electricity 
until 1943. And I was one of the first, well, I

16:32.467 --> 16:41.159
factored in this is, the first billing clerk when I 
was elected to office. And at one time, that was the

16:41.179 --> 16:51.233
largest rural electrification in the United 
States and the cheapest rural electrification in

16:41.179 --> 16:51.233
the world. And until the Tennessee Valley 
Authority came in, It was still at large, but they

17:00.209 --> 17:07.797
they are more densely populated than we are here. 
Oh, 43. Good. Just, uh, talk Tennessee Valley.

17:15.706 --> 17:20.250
You're talking about the Roseville town. Yeah.

17:25.256 --> 17:26.097
Up to this date. So far as I know, I'm the oldest 
living employer. All right, but talking back when

17:30.781 --> 17:43.182
I grew up here, this field out here was cotton. And 
Linda and I picked cotton. And if you can see, I

17:46.428 --> 17:51.336
don't know whether you can see, but right up yonder 
is a windmill. And there's a thing, that little

17:52.338 --> 17:55.343
frame. But he didn't have that windmill there. 
That was put there in the 50s. But this ditch right

18:02.857 --> 18:06.260
here was not. And from that old tree was a rope. And 
we had to bring our cotton in from the field. And on

18:14.129 --> 18:19.734
this old limb that hangs over this way, on this tree 
was where the wagon was. And we'd have to weigh our

18:19.755 --> 18:23.118
cotton up there. And we'd get on that rope. And we'd 
swing back and forth across that water and get our

18:25.698 --> 18:34.347
clothes wet so it wouldn't be so hot when we'd go 
back to put cotton. Barefooting, bull nettles out

18:34.367 --> 18:40.153
there and steaming, grass birds out there and 
getting your feet. It sure wasn't much fun. We

18:42.396 --> 18:50.204
started back out across that patch one day, and I 
said, gee, I wish to goodness I didn't have this to

18:42.396 --> 18:50.204
do. My back is just killing me. Lyndon said to me, 
President Johnson, I say Lyndon because it's hard

18:52.799 --> 18:58.926
for me to say President Johnson. But President 
Johnson said to me, he said, what are you going to do

19:00.108 --> 19:05.894
when you grow up? And I said, well, I don't know what 
I'm going to do. I said, what are you going to do? He

19:12.843 --> 19:16.887
said, well, there's an easier way to make a living 
than farming, I'll tell you that. And I said, well,

19:17.889 --> 19:19.971
I'm going to tell you one thing. I think I'll marry 
the first guy that comes along, just so he isn't a

19:20.592 --> 19:28.063
farmer, just to keep him having a business. So, 
honest to goodness, that's what I did, and that was

19:28.083 --> 19:36.155
a garageman, which sure didn't help the business, 
but it still works. Now, we picked cotton right

19:37.316 --> 19:43.866
over there, and this was my grandmother's home. 
And this cabin over here was built in 1850, 1868, by

19:44.217 --> 19:51.824
my grandfather. And she was kept under that. This, 
over 100 years ago, was much higher off the ground,

19:55.727 --> 20:02.013
boys and girls, as it is now. The dirt has washed 
under it and everything. And the Comanche Indians

20:05.697 --> 20:07.818
were quite prevalent. And I won't tell you, they 
were prevalent here in 1910.

20:13.563 --> 20:19.830
You're a little girl riding horseback, come down 
the road, and you look over the hill, and you see a

20:13.563 --> 20:19.830
bunch of Indians coming. What do you think you'd 
do? Run. Run? I didn't. I was on that horse, and I

20:24.696 --> 20:31.404
don't tell you right now, I took that horse, and I 
took that old horse from her head to her toes. And we

20:31.424 --> 20:32.946
didn't open gates. We went right over. Yeah, tell 
them about that, you and Linda didn't open that

20:35.909 --> 20:39.073
gate. Well, we didn't. And, uh, Lennon didn't, as 
the Dutchman says, Lennon didn't get to speed up

20:43.938 --> 20:50.063
like he should. We were coming down this thing, and 
he really didn't put the, as my daddy used to say,

20:50.484 --> 21:00.192
put the bud to this old man, make her get going. And 
he just kind of gigged her along, and she was just

21:00.212 --> 21:03.775
loping. He got to this gate and was supposed to jump 
it, and I was on a buckskin horse, you know what that

21:04.136 --> 21:12.763
is, that's a Spanish pony with black rings around 
his hind legs and goes, you want to watch those

21:14.347 --> 21:18.692
because they're sure nothing. And anyway, we was 
coming down that road just not even looking and I

21:19.252 --> 21:26.941
just quit mine from one end to the other and we just 
went over and flying. Old Lennon got there, this

21:26.961 --> 21:38.213
old man, she jumped and hung her hind leg in that 
gate and tore the top slat off and knocked it off the

21:26.961 --> 21:38.213
hinges and broke the light. Oh, just messed it up 
her too. And so we went on and That's my set. By the

21:47.337 --> 21:51.362
time we got through with supper, well, this 
telephone rang. This old fellow said, is this the

21:51.382 --> 21:56.928
Tom Johnson residence? My daddy says, yes, Mr. 
King, what's the matter? He said, well, do you know

22:00.573 --> 22:04.898
what your children's done this evening? My daddy 
said, no, there's not a bit of telling, just what

22:04.998 --> 22:09.704
did they do? He said, well, I want to tell you one 
thing. They did do something very, very nasty. And

22:16.632 --> 22:20.739
Papa said, oh my goodness, just what in the world 
was that? Well, they drove that horse right over

22:21.620 --> 22:26.568
that gate and just pulled it to splinters. And 
you're going to have to go clear the

22:26.648 --> 22:32.798
Fredericksburg and get that lumber and fix it 
tomorrow. And sure enough, you know what

22:32.818 --> 22:34.761
happened. It was kangaroo porn. And didn't any of 
us want to tell him whose course it was? And Daddy

22:42.813 --> 22:47.178
went to the barn, and he soon found out. And he came 
back, and you know a razor strap was not good for

22:47.378 --> 22:58.669
honing razors, but it sure was good for putting a 
finishing touch on a boy and a girl. And we got it.

23:02.133 --> 23:04.175
And I mean a full dose of it. And he just called us up. 
We just wouldn't tell him. We just wouldn't tell on

23:09.535 --> 23:13.299
one another. And, well, he told us not to ride cabs, 
too, one day. And that's the only thing we had to

23:19.685 --> 23:22.587
entertain ourselves with. Riding cabs and riding 
horses and breaking things. And we got to be all of

23:26.771 --> 23:28.833
our own. And there's a stop in the cabin. So we go 
out. And we didn't have a surf sampler. You know

23:41.375 --> 23:45.599
what a surf sampler is, don't you? One of those 
things you put on a calf or to hold on to, a rope or

23:45.619 --> 23:52.385
something to hold on while you ride. And daddy had 
some good ones. And the tugs was made out of real

23:55.388 --> 23:57.570
leather. And we took that thing and had a braving 
machine. We cut one of those tugs off and made it

24:01.573 --> 24:07.639
just to fit these calves. and took the lines, and 
Bradley just a handle on it. Boy, we had everything

24:14.538 --> 24:17.460
just a boy rosy. Mom and Daddy were in town, and we 
had eight, eight calves in there. Their mothers

24:23.706 --> 24:28.830
had worms, and we had them pitting up their 
wormies, and their mother was, they were not. And

24:29.391 --> 24:33.975
we had them in this pen, and there were seven riders 
and eight calves. And so, well, I got on this one,

24:38.770 --> 24:44.496
Well, he threw me so high it takes 20 cents to send me 
a postcard. Anyway, and I landed right on this

24:44.776 --> 24:48.380
stump. On the stump. On your stump. And yeah, it 
hurt. It really hurt. And I got up and I grunted and

24:55.167 --> 24:58.930
grunted and went over and sat down. And I said, he 
just grunted. It just really hurt. Well, anyway,

25:02.454 --> 25:07.579
we come time to eat supper that night. They all went 
in, and I just, I hurt so bad, and my side just was

25:08.960 --> 25:19.180
killing me, and I just, I just couldn't sit there at 
that table and eat a bunch of brown beans and

25:08.960 --> 25:19.180
cornbread. That's all I had, and I just couldn't 
make it going. Lemon came out, and he sunk. What am I

25:25.075 --> 25:26.637
going to tell him? He's going to ask. I say, well, 
you just tell him I'm studying. I'm busy. I'll go

25:30.903 --> 25:35.008
bring him my geography book. He goes and gets the 
geography book and brings it out to me. I'm sitting

25:38.533 --> 25:40.535
on a porch, a great long porch like this. And I just 
busied myself reading that thing. I just hurt so

25:43.860 --> 25:45.021
bad. I just couldn't hardly stand it. So long in the 
night, I said, oh, man, I hurt so bad. Man, I

25:50.749 --> 25:52.391
vomited. Man, that time I vomited up some blood. 
That kind of scared me, kind of scared a little me.

25:58.778 --> 26:01.204
Scared Marguerite, that's my sister. Boy, they 
had a conflict. We often, the other room, the

26:03.529 --> 26:10.607
daughter tried to put him on top of the room over 
here and I was over there. So we held a conference

26:11.650 --> 26:14.254
just now. What are we going to do? What are we going 
to tell them? Who's going to tell them? We're not

26:20.405 --> 26:23.450
going to tell them. So we went. Next day, I had such 
high fever. We lived ten miles out of town. had a

26:33.959 --> 26:44.594
hack to tape them in, so mama put me in the back of the 
hack, put me down, and said, she sure, said, Dr.

26:33.959 --> 26:44.594
Barnwell, I sure do believe that she has 
appendicitis. Her side hurts so bad. She never

26:48.138 --> 26:50.762
looked at me. I never pulled my gown up to let her see 
or anything. Oh, the eyes and all that. Yeah, a bit

26:56.370 --> 26:57.952
of it, just gray. And it was blue, oh, it was black. I 
was just And here I'm just black and blue. And got me

27:05.990 --> 27:08.574
in there. And he said, oh, says, this girl's had a 
terrible accident. Something's happened.

27:14.843 --> 27:15.524
What's wrong? But says, I'll tell you one thing. 
We're going to have to go in there. She's going to

27:18.308 --> 27:20.130
have to be out there. Don't let all this blood out 
and clean this thing up. All that has to be done now,

27:24.376 --> 27:28.782
it's got to be done now. And then Margaret was out in 
this hole. And man, they began to scream and cry.

27:35.559 --> 27:38.826
And I said, well, what in the world's wrong with 
you? Then they told what had happened. And asked

27:43.856 --> 27:46.141
Dr. . He said, well, I don't have it. I don't know how 
serious it is. When we get down there, we'll find

27:51.942 --> 27:53.505
out. But I said, it's serious. And he said, if she 
don't have any complications, she'll make it. And

28:01.178 --> 28:04.684
I said, well, that's just one of those things. 
Well, they knew I was going to die. And they began to

28:07.930 --> 28:12.478
cry and cry and cry and beg. any way he operated on 
him and I stayed in

28:13.167 --> 28:42.938
that hospital about two weeks that didn't break me 
from riding but he broke me from telling him that's

28:13.167 --> 28:42.938
just one of the things let's talk a little bit about 
Kevin here about how it got started, how your

28:43.255 --> 28:47.038
grandfather came into this country? This, this 
cabin was built.

28:53.324 --> 28:57.908
This cabin was built in 1854 by a man by the name of 
Provo. And he had taken up this land and taken 225

28:59.169 --> 29:05.614
acres of land. It didn't have a floor in it. And it 
didn't have a Well, we had a brush arbor out here for

29:12.871 --> 29:20.040
a porch for him to sit on. And my grandfather came 
here in 1858 and bought it from Tobolsk. And he took

29:29.972 --> 29:32.294
up land. He bought 600 acres. for 50 cents an acre. 
50 cents an acre. Did you get that? All right. And he

29:44.914 --> 29:57.407
had access to all of the land from here north

29:44.914 --> 29:57.407
out here for 10 miles that was not things. And the 
600 acres lay back this way. So you can say that he

30:04.015 --> 30:05.997
had a spread of land, access to it. And that's when 
he started in buying cattle. And so when the Civil

30:15.152 --> 30:22.902
War came on, he left and went to the Civil War. He 
married my grandmother, who was a native of

30:23.703 --> 30:31.273
Russellville,

30:23.703 --> 30:31.273
Kentucky. And her oldest brother, was governor of 
Kentucky. And they moved down here to Buda,

30:39.695 --> 30:46.004
grandmother and her parents. And he married 
grandmother and came back up here and took over

30:47.727 --> 30:54.917
this
