WEBVTT

00:05.532 --> 00:09.057
In those early years, what courses did you teach? I 
taught agricultural prices, agricultural

00:10.179 --> 00:21.916
policy, and futures and options markets. These 
were three-hour courses. Three-hour courses,

00:23.498 --> 00:30.048
and then I taught a futures and options course at 
both the graduate, well, not the early years, no,

00:23.498 --> 00:30.048
just those three. They were undergraduate? Yeah. 
Juniors and seniors? Well, one of them, I'm sorry,

00:33.513 --> 00:34.915
one of them was a graduate. Well, okay, I taught 
undergraduate prices and graduate prices. Price

00:39.939 --> 00:42.722
analysis is a big deal in agricultural economics. 
Then I taught ag policy at the graduate level, and

00:42.742 --> 00:50.410
then I taught futures and options at the 
undergraduate level. And normally these were,

00:50.650 --> 00:56.376
the students who took those were majoring in what? 
They did major in agricultural economics. These

00:57.898 --> 00:59.019
were almost all majors. These weren't service 
courses. All right, and by the time we get to the

01:02.062 --> 01:05.526
late 60s, there are women admitted How long was it 
before you had some coeds in those classes? Well,

01:11.550 --> 01:14.975
a while. We didn't have, you didn't have any 
females in agricultural economics. I'm trying to

01:21.064 --> 01:21.765
think. There were few and far between until just 
recent years, by recent I mean the last 10, 15. I

01:31.839 --> 01:32.560
can't really If you remember, I guess we had some in 
the early 70s, but there weren't many. Of those

01:40.142 --> 01:42.345
early courses, which one was your favorite? Which 
one did you enjoy most? Well, I think probably the

01:44.689 --> 01:51.160
most fun was the Futures and Options course 
because it was something that was happening

01:44.689 --> 01:51.160
daily. You could check the newspaper. The markets 
went up and down. It was very applied. Give some

01:55.625 --> 02:04.234
examples of some of the changes, sharp changes or 
lack thereof that you could relate to in class.

02:05.455 --> 02:17.166
Well, every day was a new day in the futures market 
because whatever happened overnight would

02:05.455 --> 02:17.166
affect whether it was weather or international 
policy changes or war or whatever. You'd have a new

02:17.207 --> 02:21.971
set of prices the next day in the futures market, 
which you could use as examples. And then when you

02:21.991 --> 02:22.712
had drought situations like you have now, or when 
you have surplus situations. Of course, you had

02:27.835 --> 02:29.958
dramatic changes in prices. And there was always a 
daily example to use in your teaching. And out of

02:35.826 --> 02:42.796
the Wall Street Journal, you could cut almost 
every day in the Commodities column, there was

02:35.826 --> 02:42.796
something you could talk about which was going on 
in the real world. So unlike history, where I had to

02:43.297 --> 02:51.508
revise my notes every year, which I'm sure is going 
to do, too. Did they have term papers? I had a term

02:54.130 --> 02:55.471
paper. We had an ongoing futures trading problem, 
which they would turn in their trades like once a

02:55.872 --> 03:09.025
week for as many as, I don't know, two or three 
commodities they kept track of. And then at the

03:09.045 --> 03:17.353
end, they had to write this up as a series of hedges 
or risk management exercises in the futures

03:09.045 --> 03:17.353
course. Then in the price analysis course, they 
were supposed to try to explain the price behavior

03:21.046 --> 03:24.770
for some commodity, which is pretty tough for 
anybody. Most of us aren't very good at that. But

03:26.712 --> 03:28.254
that was the assignment. Yeah, term papers are 
more prevalent then than they are now, I think. In

03:31.157 --> 03:39.487
terms of the student body, students in those 
courses, what commodities were of least interest

03:31.157 --> 03:39.487
and of most interest to them? Well, cotton and 
wheat are big in Texas. See, that's part of what's

03:44.132 --> 03:49.958
changed, too, is when I got here, almost everybody 
on the faculty was a farm boy. Mm-hmm. They had come

03:50.594 --> 03:52.576
from farming or farm-related. And the students, I 
think, were almost 100% probably agriculture or

03:53.076 --> 03:58.081
agriculture community. And over the times, that 
has changed greatly. I suppose they were probably

04:01.324 --> 04:04.547
going back to agriculture. Not now. Not at all, not 
now. The major commodities of interest to them

04:08.310 --> 04:13.735
were the ones in Texas where they'd come from. 
Cotton, wheat, cattle. If it was in the valley, it

04:18.339 --> 04:20.061
could have been orange juice because it was a 
frozen concentrated orange juice futures

04:20.598 --> 04:23.662
contract. So it's mainly because of where they're 
from. For you as a mature adult, were you ever

04:28.747 --> 04:39.159
struck by the fact that they should have been more 
interested in this commodity or that one, but

04:28.747 --> 04:39.159
apparently were not? Well, not so much. Once in a 
while, they get enamored with gold futures

04:41.422 --> 04:48.570
because they thought, well, here's the chance to 
make big bucks. I'll become a speculator. And you

04:50.450 --> 04:54.315
had to talk them out of that and tell them, no, we're 
interested in just the opposite. We're trying to

04:54.355 --> 04:56.298
manage risk, not create it. But you'd get kids that 
would go off the deep end once in a while in some

04:57.259 --> 05:04.830
commodity like gold or silver, platinum, 
futures. By and large, what would have been the

05:05.491 --> 05:12.801
typical enrollment in a section

05:05.491 --> 05:12.801
in those years? 40 would have been big. 25 to 35 
students. That was what our big classroom was

05:21.415 --> 05:26.484
probably 50, our big classroom, and that was not 
always full. Now, did you have a TA or any kind of an

05:26.964 --> 05:29.388
assistant? Yeah, we always had TAs, as I recall. We 
had good teaching support from a teaching

05:31.532 --> 05:42.230
assistant standpoint, and if you wanted to, 
depending on the schedule, you wanted to use them.

05:42.250 --> 05:47.659
And I usually graded my own tests, but they would 
grade the exercises, things like that. Yeah, we

05:47.926 --> 05:49.027
had good support. Share some anecdotes of 
faculty-student relations in those 60s and 70s,

05:49.168 --> 05:59.482
those earlier years, when it was largely an 
all-male student body. Yeah, again, the

05:59.902 --> 06:10.717
students, I don't know if it was sort of the Aggie 
Corps thing, but they were not hostile, but they

05:59.902 --> 06:10.717
were, at least I felt a little bit, we do our thing 
and you do yours. You know, when we come to class, we

06:11.197 --> 06:15.022
do, we may be sleeping in class, but we come to 
class. They did come to class, they didn't cut

06:15.603 --> 06:17.646
class, And they did their work. I didn't run, I was 
not advisor, strangely enough, I was never

06:20.582 --> 06:26.707
advisor to a core unit. So I didn't get into, we had 
kids over to our house, like I can remember we had a

06:27.448 --> 06:47.025
core commander over there and when we were with the 
MSC council with Wayne Stark, we got to know a lot of

06:27.448 --> 06:47.025
student leadership through SCONA and things like 
that, where we had good student interaction with

06:27.448 --> 06:47.025
the students. But I don't remember any other than 
helping a bunch of students get down off of the Ag

06:47.579 --> 07:02.436
building the week before Christmas where they had 
been perhaps drinking something they shouldn't

06:47.579 --> 07:02.436
have been. And they were up there singing. And 
somebody in the library complained. And when the

07:07.702 --> 07:12.948
police came, I helped talk them out of taking them 
to jail. Other than that, I can't remember any

07:12.968 --> 07:15.831
really glaring. student relations problems. 
What about students trying, giving you some kind

07:18.533 --> 07:33.487
of excuse that you thought might have been 
stretching the truth about... You had a few that

07:18.533 --> 07:33.487
you weren't ever too sure about people, how sick 
they were and so on. Mostly thinking about their

07:33.988 --> 07:34.909
work. There wasn't a lot of that. Most people kind 
of like, they minded their business, it seemed to

07:36.170 --> 07:41.635
me like it, were pretty straight up with it. So I 
don't have any creative Nothing about turning in a

07:43.958 --> 07:49.225
paper late or why they missed the final? No, didn't 
have a lot of that trouble. It's amazing how many

07:52.309 --> 07:57.976
people got married at the end of the semester that 
seemed to have to be out in somebody's wedding.

07:57.996 --> 08:02.182
That turned up a lot, which we had to try to work 
around on occasion. One of the most interesting

08:02.202 --> 08:12.295
things I ran into was, this was in later years, I 
found a student who had hired a tutor who was

08:02.202 --> 08:12.295
sitting in on the course with him. I had never 
encountered that before, and the guy had

08:13.304 --> 08:19.309
presented it to me, the tutor had presented it to 
me, and said, you know, I'm just really interested

08:13.304 --> 08:19.309
in our course economics. Would it be okay if I just 
sat in on this course? Sure, I'm not going to

08:21.611 --> 08:26.396
discourage intellectual, you know, motivation. 
So he did, and it came to find out that he was doing

08:26.616 --> 08:39.327
the same thing in another course, and the two of us 
got together, the two professors, accidentally,

08:26.616 --> 08:39.327
two teachers, and found out this guy was actually 
hiring this guy as a tutor. So I put a stop to that.

08:41.770 --> 08:43.311
Did you find out what the fee was? No, I didn't. I 
just said, man, you're out of here. That would have

08:46.630 --> 08:47.531
been when? In the 90s? Yes, it was in the 90s. I'd 
never heard of it before. Maybe it went on, but no, I

08:54.078 --> 08:55.400
didn't. Because you didn't have that many people 
visiting your class. And what about scholastic

08:59.684 --> 09:04.349
dishonesty in those early years? Well, 
fortunately, or frequently, your classroom

09:05.330 --> 09:13.399
would be such that you could place people... a desk 
between them. And if not, you tried to use A and B

09:16.065 --> 09:20.331
tests, you know, and things like that. But I don't. 
Now, Curtis Lord tells me that, you know, cheating

09:21.712 --> 09:25.176
is rampant now. I don't know that it is. I don't 
remember having that much trouble with it. Once in

09:28.220 --> 09:35.309
a while you'd catch somebody who had the A answers 
on the B test, and that was a clear-cut case, and

09:28.220 --> 09:35.309
you'd tell them, you know, you're out of here or 
something. Nobody ever contested it. Nowadays,

09:37.291 --> 09:41.496
I'm not sure what you might, probably might get 
into if you had to go to court or something like

09:37.291 --> 09:41.496
that. But I didn't notice a lot of them. Maybe I was 
just naive. Did anybody in your almost 40 years,

09:45.971 --> 10:04.988
did anybody in a position of authority ever infer 
to you or candidly tell you that you needed to pass a

09:45.971 --> 10:04.988
certain percentage or flunk a certain percentage 
or anything like that? Nobody ever told me how to

10:06.009 --> 10:08.491
teach a course. Nobody ever told me Well, I did get a 
call from the athletic department once about a kid

10:11.800 --> 10:28.462
who subsequently was out of here anyhow, 
inquiring about some grade and if I was sure I had it

10:11.800 --> 10:28.462
right and so on and so forth. I wasn't sure what the 
message was, but they never did pursue it. But

10:31.846 --> 10:36.713
nobody ever called me in the dean's office and 
said, you know, we need to have a different grade

10:31.846 --> 10:36.713
here. At least I don't recall ever being 
interfered with in a classroom. As far as I was

10:40.403 --> 10:51.338
concerned, I had total academic freedom at that 
level, which was either good or bad news because

10:40.403 --> 10:51.338
maybe I needed more direction than I got. But 
nobody ever interfered that way. And in those

10:54.602 --> 10:57.086
early years, where did you post your grades? On the 
wall with the name and the number. Everybody saw

11:01.071 --> 11:02.533
everybody's grades. Had you encountered that at 
Penn State or Oklahoma A&M? I can't recall that we

11:07.800 --> 11:09.162
didn't. I mean, I'm not saying I don't remember. We 
probably did, but... We didn't do that at Rice or

11:11.858 --> 11:15.543
Austin College, no. See, I'm not recalling that we 
posted the grades that way, but we sure did here,

11:15.763 --> 11:22.012
that's right. In the department in those early 
years, were there some key courses that,

11:22.032 --> 11:29.202
according to the students, were the tough 
courses?

11:31.906 --> 11:36.433
Yeah, we introduced one sort of an 
econometrics-type course at the undergraduate

11:31.906 --> 11:36.433
level. That was sort of a filter course. Then I 
think they probably thought Production

11:39.247 --> 11:46.573
Economics 325 was a lot of work.

11:50.357 --> 11:51.217
I'm not sure about 105. That was our introductory 
course. Who taught it? Everybody took that. J.C.

11:54.941 --> 11:55.701
Grady. J.C. Grady taught the 105. He was the 
father, so to speak, of the undergraduate

11:59.665 --> 12:02.707
section. But I would guess those are the ones, the 
317, econometrics course. Now, that was in

12:10.859 --> 12:12.842
agricultural economics. I think when you went 
over to economics, see we took courses all over the

12:13.704 --> 12:24.083
place, in business and economics, some of the tech 
fields, animal science and so on. Probably the

12:24.263 --> 12:31.697
toughest time to have would be over in economics, 
having maybe income and employment or and that

12:31.880 --> 12:34.543
sort of thing, macroeconomics. Were there any 
courses in the department that supposedly,

12:34.563 --> 12:43.254
according to the students, were kind of easy, kind 
of crip courses? Well, I'm sure there were, and we

12:44.916 --> 12:50.423
had a guy named Dr. Dan, the grade point man, but 
that was sociology. Yeah, what did you hear from

12:50.443 --> 12:56.590
the students about, where did he get that nickname 
and why? Well, I presume that he was fairly easy on

12:57.331 --> 13:00.475
the grading. I don't know, but he... Dr. Dan had 
gotten his, he had a cut on his nose. It clearly had

13:06.008 --> 13:07.891
been cut. The legend was that he'd gotten a knife 
fight or somebody had knifed him. His degree was

13:12.418 --> 13:14.020
from the University of Chicago. I believe he had a 
master's. He may have been a PhD. I'm not sure. But

13:18.446 --> 13:23.894
other than that course, again, I didn't have that 
much. Some guys have a much better or closer or

13:23.934 --> 13:28.882
whatever, I guess, relationship with students. 
Not that I didn't talk to the students. Not that my

13:30.184 --> 13:31.165
door wasn't open. But I didn't have a lot of 
interaction with students. Let's see, this is Dan

13:35.888 --> 13:37.270
Davis. No, no, this wasn't Dan Davis. Dan Russell. 
Dan Russell. Yeah, Dan Russell. And he's the one

13:41.475 --> 13:48.243
that deserves credit for thinking up the project 
house idea back in the Depression. I didn't do

13:48.644 --> 13:49.304
that. I believe he's the one. Dr. Dan. He was a fine 
old gentleman. Of course, all these guys were.

13:56.693 --> 13:58.215
Because I heard a legend once. I heard a legend one 
time that

13:58.567 --> 14:14.150
he had posted his grades and there was an 
appropriate A, B, C, D, E, F break. And a student

14:14.170 --> 14:27.188
came to the department wanting to check on his 
grades and the secretary looked in the grade book

14:14.170 --> 14:27.188
and he had gotten a higher grade turned in than the 
grade posted on the door. What? He really didn't.

14:31.900 --> 14:35.285
Now that's just a myth, I don't know. Let's go back 
to your point on grading because when I got here,

14:35.546 --> 14:41.514
grades were 93 and up was an A. There were 70 and 
below was an F. Yes. And only 30 points were for

14:46.502 --> 14:51.930
actual, the D was 70 through 77, I think, or 76. So it 
was grading, when it reduced to 60, I don't know if

14:51.970 --> 14:58.459
that was the Vietnam War or when they brought that 
in, but That changed, that certainly changed the

14:58.726 --> 15:00.848
grading system. But when you as a new faculty 
member gave a grade on an essay test, didn't you

15:00.908 --> 15:14.781
first decide whether this question deserved an A, 
B, C, D, or F? And then you assigned the appropriate

15:16.002 --> 15:19.826
points under that system. Well, each question had 
its own points, its own weight. Yeah, yeah, yeah,

15:24.871 --> 15:27.433
right. Well, no, actually, when I got through, I 
just looked at total points. No, but was it tougher

15:32.156 --> 15:35.840
to make an A under that system? Oh, yeah. Oh, yeah. 
You think it was? Oh, yeah. Well, you mean under the

15:38.983 --> 15:41.225
system now? Yeah, because we had just squished it 
up. So there was a, yeah, I think grading was

15:45.809 --> 15:48.792
tougher back then. I mean, I think it was lower. All 
right, as the years go, as we're going to start

15:51.375 --> 15:57.741
going now chronologically,

16:00.421 --> 16:14.119
You think that the typical member of the 
department, and particularly you, thought it was

16:00.421 --> 16:14.119
good for A&M to make the changes in co-education, 
non-compulsory core, racial integration, and so

16:00.421 --> 16:14.119
forth? Yes, I think that was agreed. Do you 
remember any departmental realities regarding

16:18.064 --> 16:28.318
the first female students, how they were received 
and so forth?

16:31.555 --> 16:33.077
You know, that's a good question. I really don't. 
There would have been so few that they would have

16:33.897 --> 16:37.461
been noticed, that's for sure. But you don't 
remember any? I don't remember any adverse or

16:39.083 --> 16:42.567
positive. What about black students? Aspects of 
that. Gosh, black students came so late to our

16:45.089 --> 16:47.152
department. We get so few black students in 
agricultural economics. Fred McClure sticks

16:52.077 --> 16:53.218
out. I was about to say. Yeah, yeah. But they're 
rare as undergraduates, even as graduate

16:55.805 --> 17:02.172
students. We don't get many black students. 
Describe what you recall about Fred McClure as a

17:04.215 --> 17:08.720
student and as a leader. Strangely enough, Fred is 
one guy I missed in my course. In my course,

17:13.045 --> 17:14.547
everybody had to pass through it. But that year, 
somebody else taught it. We taught two sections,

17:17.130 --> 17:19.533
and I didn't get to have Fred in the class. But he was 
a presence to be reckoned with and very active.

17:24.948 --> 17:28.212
very popular, but I never did really get to know him 
through a class. I missed him, and I regret that

17:28.632 --> 17:39.465
because he, and I've known him better later when he 
comes back to the department, but he was certainly

17:28.632 --> 17:39.465
exceptional, no question about that. When did you 
all begin to get any international undergraduate

17:39.485 --> 17:43.410
students? Well, first of all, we don't have many 
international undergraduate students.

17:49.517 --> 17:50.398
Graduate students, yes. Mexico, I think probably 
we'd get some few from Mexico. But it'd be

17:56.828 --> 18:03.917
interesting to know today just how many we have 
international, very few international graduate

17:56.828 --> 18:03.917
students. Not a whole lot out of state 
undergraduates. We're so heavily Texan. And

18:11.027 --> 18:18.917
geographically, where down through the years, 
where have the undergraduate students come from

18:11.027 --> 18:18.917
in Texas? Well, through the years, it's changed. I 
mean, you know, now it's Houston, what, Houston,

18:21.625 --> 18:25.530
Dallas, San Antonio, Austin. Then it was like 
towns. But still, even in agricultural

18:27.373 --> 18:35.464
economics, I noticed up until recent years, I had 
kids fill out every first of my class, I always had

18:27.373 --> 18:35.464
them fill out a slip. Where are you from? Hometown. 
What was your hometown mascot? You know, your high

18:40.390 --> 18:42.193
school mascot, stuff like that. And I was 
surprised how many of them came from small towns,

18:43.034 --> 18:49.242
even in the 90s. The ones we were getting here were, 
many were from small towns. There were some from

18:52.729 --> 19:02.567
Houston and places, but still a lot of rural areas 
in Texas are sending them at least into

18:52.729 --> 19:02.567
agricultural economics. And as far as you were 
aware, they thought that they were going into the

19:03.989 --> 19:10.842
real world of agricultural economics. Well, they 
did, and yet if you'd ask them how many are going

19:11.193 --> 19:15.319
back to the farm, they weren't. There were very few 
who were going back to the farm. You know, two or

19:17.122 --> 19:19.105
three hands might go up in the whole class. But 
agribusiness has become the word of the day. We

19:24.333 --> 19:28.159
have changed, and that's part of the name change 
controversy. What do we change our name to? And

19:29.341 --> 19:38.635
many agricultural economics departments have 
changed their name to agriculture and applied

19:29.341 --> 19:38.635
economics or something like that, or 
agribusiness economics. And we haven't, but we

19:39.391 --> 19:43.616
have an agribusiness major, and it's very 
popular. It's with the business school, so you

19:44.236 --> 19:48.261
have to have a little higher grades to get into it. 
But so they go, most of them do go to work with

19:49.041 --> 19:54.728
something agriculture-related, but a 
significant number don't. I mean, they go out

19:54.748 --> 19:57.951
totally divorced from agriculture. All right, in 
the early years when you get here, about, What was

20:04.484 --> 20:09.709
the proportion of the graduate enrollment to the 
undergraduate in majors? Well, it'd be much, much

20:11.391 --> 20:13.213
less. When I was, we had, first of all, we didn't 
have a Ph.D. program, as I recall. Okay. I don't

20:22.462 --> 20:24.183
think we had a Ph.D. program. So we had master's. I 
could be wrong on that, but I don't. I reckon how

20:26.966 --> 20:29.609
many master's degrees be finished a year? Yeah, 
well, I don't know, four, five, six, maybe. So it

20:35.382 --> 20:38.526
was much more heavily undergraduate. When I was 
sort of administering the graduate program, we

20:38.546 --> 20:46.155
had 200 graduate students. When was that? That 
would have been, oh, late 70s and through the 80s. I

20:50.741 --> 20:52.122
had that about 9 or 10 years. Gave it up in 87 or 
something like that, 88, I don't know. And we had

20:57.309 --> 21:02.655
200 graduate students, 40 or 50 of those were 
really Ivan Shmederman's real estate students.

21:08.109 --> 21:09.391
But they were part of our department. And 50 PhDs, 
100 master of science. Oh, man, I'm not used to

21:15.400 --> 21:19.166
talking this much. And then we had at one time, we 
peaked out, I think, at 800 undergraduates. So we

21:22.311 --> 21:25.996
were close to 1,000 in this department. We're not 
that high now. And we're not that many graduate

21:28.380 --> 21:29.942
students now. Those graduate students, where 
were they from geographically? Most of them would

21:33.885 --> 21:36.228
have been from Texas. A few you get from the north, 
northeast. What about international?

21:42.674 --> 21:49.561
International, mostly Asian, and some from 
Africa, a few from Africa. We got, at a certain

21:50.481 --> 21:56.207
point in time, we got a lot of Peace Corps kids come 
back through here, female Peace Corps kids. I can

21:56.748 --> 21:58.309
count five, six, seven. who are now out in 
professional positions as agricultural

21:58.475 --> 22:03.440
economists who were Peace Corps females. And then 
also males came back. We got a slug of Peace Corps

22:06.583 --> 22:08.805
people, still get some Peace Corps people. I think 
they come back, you know, seeing that eating is

22:09.846 --> 22:20.195
important and they want to feed the world and they 
typically get a degree and go into a regular

22:09.846 --> 22:20.195
professional agri-economics position 
somewhere in a faculty.

22:22.798 --> 22:28.363
But we've never been heavy on, we've gotten a few 
from, I can name like one or two guys from the

22:22.798 --> 22:28.363
Netherlands We had one through here from Germany, 
but not many from Western Europe have we had in

22:29.508 --> 22:36.054
graduate school. Now, Dr. Tim served as 
department head until about when? Well, I want to

22:40.779 --> 22:43.962
say around 1970. I want to say. That may be too late, 
but I think so, yeah. When did the department have

22:47.345 --> 22:55.233
any discussions about how it was going to progress 
to become bigger, better, stronger? Oh, yeah. We

22:55.773 --> 22:57.675
had departmental studies. couldn't pull them off 
the shelf for you, but I don't know if it was

22:58.043 --> 23:18.095
mandated from the top down or we thought it up 
ourselves, but where are we going, whom should we

22:58.043 --> 23:18.095
be serving, who's our audience, what's our 
mission, how do we want to, you know, and continual

22:58.043 --> 23:18.095
sort of a rolling thing on are we teaching the right 
courses and stuff like that. So we've had, there's

23:18.155 --> 23:22.983
a name for those studies, but I can't think of it 
right now. As you recall those discussions, What

23:25.803 --> 23:32.033
did the department normally agree upon as the 
strengths and the weaknesses of the department at

23:25.803 --> 23:32.033
that? Well, we had to sort of pick among areas. Like 
in agricultural economics, you have marketing,

23:35.038 --> 23:43.752
production economics, resource economics, 
community economics, and so on. And we sort of

23:43.772 --> 23:47.458
decided, well, we're going to try to get good in 
marketing. We're going to be good in marketing.

23:49.073 --> 24:12.702
and little left synthesis maybe on production 
economics or something and do less of that more of

23:49.073 --> 24:12.702
the more resource economics that got popular not 
going to do labor economics you know stuff but i

23:49.073 --> 24:12.702
can't i think probably marketing dr tim's sort of 
favorite marketing and policy he liked

23:49.073 --> 24:12.702
agricultural policy so we have an agricultural 
policy center here which i'm not sure how

23:49.073 --> 24:12.702
instrumental he was in it but that we do have one Did 
the dean and vice president of academic affairs,

24:13.863 --> 24:25.654
was there support for this effort above the 
departmental level, as far as you all know? You

24:25.994 --> 24:26.715
mean studying? Well, this progress that you all 
were hoping to make. Haskell, I don't know. I

24:32.600 --> 24:33.181
couldn't tell you. But you don't know of anything 
where you all sent forth a recommendation, it was

24:33.221 --> 24:38.646
turned down? No, I don't know that there wasn't 
support for it. I just don't know. what happened at

24:41.740 --> 24:42.882
those levels. Did you all feel like that there was 
some fiscal ability to make some of these changes?

24:51.375 --> 24:52.136
Yeah, I think so. And, again, back in those days 
where you got your money allocated by formula from

24:52.156 --> 25:02.892
the federal sources, and state support was, I 
think, probably not too bad in Texas. I'm not sure

25:02.912 --> 25:05.396
how it stacked up compared to Iowa or something 
like that. But I don't think resources were all

25:06.317 --> 25:10.684
that limiting at that time. uh... and i think we 
looked at other departments i think ty did and then

25:11.575 --> 25:40.789
john hopkin came in from illinois who was new blood 
as department head and he'd been around he'd been

25:11.575 --> 25:40.789
vice president of bank of america or something in 
california or that bank of america i'm not sure

25:11.575 --> 25:40.789
where his office was but uh... he was new blood new 
directions and his idea was just to hire as many

25:11.575 --> 25:40.789
good people as he can and he did but i think ty looked 
at other departments to see what they were doing

25:11.575 --> 25:40.789
describe uh... hopkin He came about in 1970? Yeah, 
he would have come from Illinois. He had been, I

25:46.095 --> 25:51.621
believe, vice president of Bank of America in San 
Francisco, California. John was a finance.

25:55.185 --> 26:04.074
Agricultural finance became a really hot issue 
and a hot item, and we started hiring finance

25:55.185 --> 26:04.074
people right after John got here, some of them from 
the University of Illinois. But John's approach

26:04.835 --> 26:10.641
was, I'm going to hire the best people I can and then 
let them do what they want to do. and, you know, let

26:11.026 --> 26:26.327
them get their own money, or give them money as I 
can, but he was, he wasn't an automatic pilot, but

26:11.026 --> 26:26.327
he was pretty much a more academic, he was a more 
academic department head, I think, and probably

26:11.026 --> 26:26.327
Ty was a little more authoritarian. In the search 
for a new department head, was there any

26:26.968 --> 26:32.175
departmental involvement? Yeah, there 
certainly was, there must have been with John, I

26:37.840 --> 26:41.205
know there was quite a bit with Padberg when he came 
in. But with Hopkins, I'm sure there was some, yes.

26:44.751 --> 26:46.714
I just can't remember how extensive it was. I'm 
sure he came for an interview. And in his personal

26:49.398 --> 26:54.566
religious faith, he was a newcomer, wasn't he? 
Yeah, yeah. There weren't many LDS, and John

26:56.329 --> 27:00.215
certainly was that. He was prominent, I know, in 
the church. Describe his leadership style. Well,

27:05.583 --> 27:10.468
I

27:05.583 --> 27:10.468
think John was an enabler. He would help you. If 
you'd go and explain to him why you thought you

27:12.891 --> 27:17.416
wanted to do something and you justified, he would 
try to help you. As I say, his policy, I think,

27:18.957 --> 27:25.665
basically, as I observed it, was I'm going to hire 
the best people I can and then let them do their

27:18.957 --> 27:25.665
thing. He wasn't heavy-handed, and I think he took 
pretty good care of us. He had some fights with

27:32.632 --> 27:35.235
the... fights, I say, with the dean or with the 
director of the experiment station in a

27:35.840 --> 27:41.068
good-natured fashion. I think they were pretty 
much good-natured, but I think he would go to bat

27:41.128 --> 27:47.138
for the department and try to get some things that 
he thought were needed. Did you all feel that he had

27:47.618 --> 27:54.629
the same level of influence, comparatively 
speaking, that Dr. Tim did? Well, he didn't have

27:55.851 --> 27:57.314
the old boy hookups. He wasn't an Aggie. He wasn't a 
Texan. But I think that he... and was pretty able to

28:03.920 --> 28:05.742
hold his own, yeah. And Dr. Tim ceased being 
department head because of retirement. Yeah, and

28:10.508 --> 28:15.734
Ty, yes, I think it was that, partly his health, but 
I think retirement. At that time, didn't you have

28:16.174 --> 28:18.156
to retire at a certain age? Yeah. I think that's 
what got him. And Ty, he didn't live very long after

28:19.818 --> 28:21.740
that. Well, and what I wanted to make clear is that 
it was not, he wasn't a terminator. No, no, no, I

28:27.887 --> 28:29.269
never had. knowledge that he was forced out or 
anything. I don't think so. And by this time, Harry

28:33.023 --> 28:36.467
Kunkel is the dean. Right. And did the department 
have any impression of him, you think? Well, I

28:42.733 --> 28:46.077
think he was a very good researcher and teacher. 
Dr.

28:46.097 --> 28:51.222
Kunkel was clearly an intellectual, I think. He 
was a thinker. And impression as a dean, I'm not

28:52.523 --> 28:56.387
sure he He was dean and director, let's see, of 
Experiment Station? Both, maybe? Yeah.

29:05.436 --> 29:06.197
Terrible, I can't remember. But he'll tell you.

29:13.166 --> 29:17.532
President Rutter dies in early 1970.

29:19.955 --> 29:26.323
What did you and your colleagues, what was your 
perception of him as Texas A&M's president and

29:19.955 --> 29:26.323
leader?

29:29.240 --> 29:44.455
Well, he was clearly not really tuned to the 
academic scene, we thought, of course, as young

29:29.240 --> 29:44.455
Turks, but very respected, I think, for his 
honesty and forthrightness. I always thought of

29:44.695 --> 29:58.369
him as like Nixon going to China, that only Nixon 
could go to China because of who he was, and only

29:44.695 --> 29:58.369
President Rudder could have integrated Texas A&M 
both racially and even more so female thing. He was

29:58.720 --> 30:00.022
the man for the time. Certainly Morgan couldn't 
have done it before him, I don't think. He just did

30:02.526 --> 30:05.630
that. And I think he was fair-minded. Probably 
would have liked to have been approached more by

30:08.414 --> 30:11.899
the faculty than he was. And I think probably he may 
have felt somewhat isolated from the faculty

30:12.580 --> 30:22.635
because he wasn't, you know, a degreed, in a sense, 
terminal degreed person. But I don't think he was,

30:23.290 --> 30:29.117
I think he was certainly respected, and I think he 
was a man for the time and the place, just ideal. Did

30:30.018 --> 30:33.202
you all ever talk about his ability as a public 
speaker? Yeah, yeah, bless his heart. You know, he

30:35.845 --> 30:39.930
just really didn't turn you on that way. I mean, you 
were patient, but he, and I think he knew it. I think

30:43.454 --> 30:46.538
he knew he was not a public speaker, but I think he 
dreaded it. I don't think he looked forward to it at

30:46.938 --> 30:48.640
all. Were you aware that his health was declining 
not long before his death? Well, it's amazing how,

30:54.811 --> 30:59.237
you know, you see people change when they get in the 
office. And when he came in, he was a fairly...

31:00.179 --> 31:03.403
looked like a normal person. But I noticed that he 
just ballooned over time and just... He really

31:07.949 --> 31:09.331
looked like the... I think the strain on him must 
have been fantastic. It must have been. And, of

31:12.856 --> 31:17.682
course, you eat all those rubber chicken and pea 
dinners, and he just didn't handle that well. I

31:17.883 --> 31:18.964
mean, I think he was... Maybe he was just too 
conscientious. He just bore too much stress. He

31:22.897 --> 31:25.073
didn't take care of himself.
