00:03.794 --> 00:15.686
Today, this is an interview with Dr. Bill Gregory 
by Michael Picard on the 11th to the 30th at Texas

00:03.794 --> 00:15.686
A&M University concerning Vietnam. In the 
interest of accumulating knowledge, I'm asking

00:16.126 --> 00:23.053
you to donate this tape to me at this time, Dr. 
Gregory. Is that all right with you? Yeah, you're

00:25.636 --> 00:31.622
welcome to use it in your classwork, but I want you 
to not use it in anything else. All right. Can I have

00:32.802 --> 00:38.430
a little information about your background and 
education?

00:42.876 --> 00:47.222
I went to high school, a private school in 
Tennessee, Webb School. Graduated there in 50,

00:48.024 --> 00:52.850
right at the start of the Korean War. Then I spent 
two and a half years at SMU

00:54.773 --> 01:01.763
studying geology at that At the time, the call to go 
flying airplanes was more than schoolwork, and so

01:02.215 --> 01:19.952
I dropped out of college, went into aviation 
cadets, and got my wings commissioned in 1955,

01:02.215 --> 01:19.952
February.

01:20.072 --> 01:28.881
From that point on, I flew a multitude of 
airplanes, advanced jet gunnery, school in 1958.

01:32.471 --> 01:40.659
After

01:32.471 --> 01:40.659
that period of time, I flew some bombers, most 
notable of which was the B-58. When we shut down the

01:42.061 --> 01:52.130
B-58s, I went over to Vietnam and flew gunships and 
was an operations officer there for a year. And

01:53.592 --> 01:59.998
then concluded my career in the Air Force in 1973 
and went back to college in Started all over again

02:00.755 --> 02:09.324
and got degrees from Southwest Texas and Texas 
A&M.

02:09.384 --> 02:15.150
Dr. Gregory, could you give me some ideas about 
your military education and what it consisted of?

02:17.472 --> 02:18.533
Right, Mike. Of course, it started off with the 
indoctrination forces down at Lackland.

02:28.075 --> 02:34.622
basically everybody went through, we went 
through his aviation cadets, which is a little bit

02:28.075 --> 02:34.622
stricter program for six weeks. And then for the 
next 12 weeks, it was 12 weeks long. And then from

02:39.907 --> 02:42.851
that point, we went 12 months into flying school. 
We had, of course, every morning or afternoon we

02:44.012 --> 02:48.096
flew. And on the other part of the day, we had 
classroom activities. So it was a pretty

02:51.800 --> 02:56.665
intensive 12 month program from that point on. All 
the formal training that we had in the military was

02:57.657 --> 03:07.286
sort of a continuous activity of classroom or 
flight training.

03:10.129 --> 03:18.717
I did squadron officer school, which is sort of 
prerequisite for anyone to continue in the Air

03:10.129 --> 03:18.717
Force. All of my flying schools, like for B-47s, 
B-58s, T-39s, F-100s,

03:27.847 --> 03:36.961
F-86s all took about three months each. And so the 
career in the Air Force is a continuous education

03:37.682 --> 03:42.109
program. You go from one school, one job. As you 
advance in rank, you generally are re-schooled in

03:45.354 --> 03:53.366
certain other areas. I also took a couple of ground 
courses I was qualified as a surface and air

03:56.180 --> 04:09.394
transportation officer very early in my career 
and later chemical, biological and nuclear

03:56.180 --> 04:09.394
warfare officer.

04:12.797 --> 04:23.048
In the last few years of my career, I attended riot 
control school in Fort Benning, Georgia, which

04:12.797 --> 04:23.048
was an unusual opportunity to mix with mayors, law 
enforcement officials and whatever from

04:23.720 --> 04:34.030
Washington DC, Gary, Indiana, Kent State 
University and all over the country. So our

04:34.070 --> 04:38.735
military education was a continuous thing. I felt 
like I was in school for 20 years while I was in the

04:38.775 --> 04:45.642
service.

04:45.662 --> 04:48.705
Dr. Gregory, why and when did you join the 
services? Mike, I joined in I applied in February

04:52.981 --> 05:04.915
of 1953 and had to go through a battery test. Many

05:05.256 --> 05:20.254
of the youth of the United States wanted to get 
involved in the Korean War and there was of course a

05:05.256 --> 05:20.254
large draft going on. A lot of people wanted to get 
in the Air Force or Navy rather than being in the

05:20.453 --> 05:25.059
ground forces in the Army. I had to wait until 
October for a class assignment. And during that

05:29.664 --> 05:32.188
time, I was almost drafted in the Army. I came up 
and, fortunately, had a school deferment that

05:32.208 --> 05:39.497
allowed me to wait for my class assignment. The 
motivation for it, I guess, from about the fourth

05:40.578 --> 05:49.549
grade, I've always wanted to fly airplanes. 
utmost in my mind to to want to do something like

05:50.035 --> 06:18.456
that and of course the Korean conflict again put 
the romance of the war back in everybody's mind

05:50.035 --> 06:18.456
that you know had read about World War II or World 
War I and of course I was a young boy during World War

05:50.035 --> 06:18.456
II and had been a spotter for the Civil Guard and all 
that sort of thing. And just loved airplanes and

06:20.954 --> 06:25.099
had flown several times before that. So my 
motivation was strictly to go fly airplanes and be

06:26.440 --> 06:30.465
a fighter pilot. Dream of every young man that was 
very aggressive at that time.

06:38.334 --> 06:44.200
Dr. Grege, were the man in your squadron mentally 
and physically trained from Vietnam? And could

06:44.480 --> 06:45.982
you explain their training? All right, Mike. 
Certainly the individuals that were sent to

06:49.300 --> 06:56.346
Vietnam were considered to be professional 
soldiers. The officers, of course, have been

06:58.028 --> 07:09.659
through extensive flying or navigation training 
and definitely were highly trained. The mental

07:11.801 --> 07:16.725
aspects of the officers in my organization I had 
very, very little problems with anybody other

07:18.038 --> 07:27.432
than to take care of the mission we were assigned. 
They knew it was their job. We had no doubt that we

07:29.214 --> 07:33.821
were there for that reason, and they did very well 
at it. Our enlisted men, the NCOs, of course, had 10

07:34.742 --> 07:44.957
to 15, 18 years of service and were probably some of 
the best in their career fields. Most of my NCOs

07:49.637 --> 07:55.346
were flight engineers.

07:58.350 --> 08:10.327
It had four or five thousand flying hours in other 
aircraft and had taken care of aircraft and worked

07:58.350 --> 08:10.327
with them their entire career. The younger people 
were my gunnery people for the gunships we had and

08:12.983 --> 08:37.101
people we call illuminator operators who were it 
was a new field that was developing the gunnery the

08:12.983 --> 08:37.101
older gunnery people we always had people that 
handled munitions and what have you but very few

08:12.983 --> 08:37.101
operation

08:12.983 --> 08:37.101
individuals operated guns as they did in world war 
ii until they developed the gunship. And now

08:39.212 --> 08:43.417
again, we had people that were standing by these 
guns again. They fired automatically, but they

08:43.437 --> 08:55.592
had to load them, maintain them, and even tear them 
down and rebuild them in flight while we were in a

08:43.437 --> 08:55.592
combat operation.

08:55.612 --> 09:00.959
How successful was your gunship squadron during 
Vietnam? Could you explain? Mike, I'll try to. I

09:03.842 --> 09:07.527
was the operations officer of a small AC gunship 
called the AC-119G model. It was the second

09:16.599 --> 09:19.883
generation of gunships in Vietnam. The

09:19.943 --> 09:27.630
magic dragon was the first one, the AC-47. We had 
another model of our airplane, the 119K, that had

09:29.032 --> 09:37.480
two jet engines and it had 20 caliber Gatling guns. 
20 millimeter, excuse me. We had the NATO round

09:41.777 --> 09:54.607
mini guns in four of them in the other, in our 
gunship and the K model also had four of those. It

09:55.248 --> 10:03.014
was a fairly sophisticated airplane and had a 
radar system, a ballistic computer.

10:06.637 --> 10:09.660
The K model also had a radar to pick out targets 
with. As far as sighting the thing, we had an

10:15.358 --> 10:37.251
automatic system that the navigator worked out of 
the backside of the airplane that we call a NOS, a

10:15.358 --> 10:37.251
night observation device, and it gave you a 
negative relief picture, and you could see down

10:15.358 --> 10:37.251
into the jungle at night very clearly with it. Our 
operation at Thompson-Nood Air Base in Saigon

10:37.653 --> 10:45.320
was, we were the only combat operation on the base. 
As far as what we call a combat operation, we were

10:46.361 --> 10:54.669
the only operating outfit on the base that fired an 
enemy and was fired back upon. There was another

10:54.689 --> 11:06.900
outfit in C-47s that dropped leaflets all the time 
that we called BS bombers, but ours was the single

10:54.689 --> 11:06.900
combat outfit there. uh as far as the 
effectiveness of our group uh our the control for

11:07.741 --> 11:36.718
the combat area was right there at tonson and i was 
friends with several people carl skillar who was

11:07.741 --> 11:36.718
the commander of the command post and they were the 
people that gave us our clearances to fire and he

11:07.741 --> 11:36.718
always was amused when certain pilots of mine got 
up in the air because he knew the results would grow

11:36.884 --> 12:05.473
up markedly on the days that these individuals 
flew and the motivation of these guys to do the job

11:36.884 --> 12:05.473
and try to to assist the the people that were 
defending themselves against the vietcong

11:36.884 --> 12:05.473
highly motivated throughout their 12-month tour 
of duty i would say that our combat operations we

11:36.884 --> 12:05.473
received the A couple of presidential citations 
and what have you, which was normal for most

12:07.141 --> 12:20.037
outfits, but our greatest achievement was the 
fact that we never lost a man or an airplane in the 12

12:07.141 --> 12:20.037
months I was there. We had two minor Purple Hearts 
or really battle scratches from shells coming in

12:21.419 --> 12:31.832
the airplane, but the individuals We were never 
even taken off flying status for their injuries.

12:37.983 --> 12:40.286
And we were real proud that we never lost an 
airplane. We, of course, came very close and took

12:40.306 --> 12:56.611
some severe hits, but the quality of the pilots who 
followed the tactical doctrine that we created

12:40.306 --> 12:56.611
there at Thompson, as long as they followed it, 
they stood a chance of surviving. And we did. I had

12:58.854 --> 13:01.498
personally came there with nine. officer crew 
members and we all went home on the same airplane

13:02.440 --> 13:12.794
together which was a gratifying thing and we felt 
like we did quite a bit of good. We were working out

13:12.834 --> 13:30.658
of Vietnam in Cambodia in areas that were called 
Freedom Deal and places like that that were

13:12.834 --> 13:30.658
classified by the White House as things that we 
needed to defend and still have good friends from

13:31.077 --> 13:32.619
from the people of Cambodia. One of them lives in 
the general room that lives up in Dallas now. It's

13:38.327 --> 13:46.758
really an interesting thing to go day by day and 
feel like you are keeping these people alive, so to

13:38.327 --> 13:46.758
speak. How many of your men or career are enlisted 
in your squadron? The squadron we had there was 234

13:53.747 --> 14:00.055
flying personnel.

14:01.402 --> 14:20.413
On each aircraft, we had an eight-man crew, four 
officers and four enlisted men consisting of

14:01.402 --> 14:20.413
pilot, co-pilot, a navigator, an observation 
device operator, two gunnery men, a flight

14:01.402 --> 14:20.413
engineer, and an illuminator operator for the 
rear. We had ten crews and basically three other

14:28.098 --> 14:54.763
officers in the squadron so we had approximately 
43 people we supposedly we had a maintenance

14:28.098 --> 14:54.763
officer I only saw a maintenance officer there 
three months so that was one of my additional

14:28.098 --> 14:54.763
duties while I was there maintenance and ops 
officer and at one time the squadron commander was

14:28.098 --> 14:54.763
gone for three months and so I got all three of the 
jobs so it was sort of a consuming job you you work

14:28.098 --> 14:54.763
from seven in the morning to seven at night doing 
your regular duties. I flew 175 combat missions

14:57.857 --> 15:03.122
while I was there on top of my regular duties. In 
fact, the first five months I didn't take a day off.

15:07.746 --> 15:13.010
And that was sort of what was expected and what was 
seen out of all the crew members. Our gunners, who

15:13.030 --> 15:18.535
were always short of them, they flew a schedule of 
six days on and one day off. Was there a difference

15:19.296 --> 15:23.940
between a career man and an enlisted man? They had 
to join because of the draft. Was there a

15:26.961 --> 15:28.964
difference in their performance? In any big 
operations, you always have a few problems with

15:30.105 --> 15:35.393
people. We were really blessed by the fact that we 
had very little problems with drugs in our

15:35.473 --> 15:43.485
operations. To my knowledge, and of course this is 
just a guess, we had one person involved in heroin

15:44.046 --> 15:52.999
and he came in and turned himself in three days 
before he went back. He was a radio communications

15:56.396 --> 16:01.925
maintenance person, enlisted man. I always 
wondered about him. He smiled all the time and

16:03.567 --> 16:09.717
seemed like he was happy and he was hooked on 
heroin. That was when the time he turned himself in

16:09.837 --> 16:16.928
was about June of of 1971 when they started the 
Golden Stream operations, which was checking

16:17.245 --> 16:31.342
people for drugs out of Vietnam and trying to start 
controlling some of the input back into the United

16:17.245 --> 16:31.342
States. I'm sure there must have been some 
marijuana smoking there. To my knowledge, I know

16:36.328 --> 16:45.700
of no pilot or officer crew member who was ever 
involved with any Hallucinogenic drug now. We all

16:49.494 --> 16:51.236
probably drank too much. After missions and we had 
a what we call a party hooch. And I was able to. Get

16:59.045 --> 17:03.110
for our squadron just a month after I got there and. 
We. As officers 43 of us. Consumed a tremendous

17:08.076 --> 17:11.039
amount of beer each month. In fact, we flew 100 
cases in from Philippines each month and that was

17:11.119 --> 17:16.125
not enough to get us through. But after a four-hour 
mission in the night or in the daytime when your

17:16.865 --> 17:34.221
people are shooting at you, you probably need a 
beer or two or four or five to unwind before you hit

17:16.865 --> 17:34.221
the bed and think about getting up for the next 
mission. As far as any other problem with these

17:34.241 --> 17:41.588
guys, I don't guess I've ever worked in a more 
professional outfit. Our maintenance people

17:43.932 --> 17:50.860
worked around the clock sometimes just to keep our 
airplanes going when we had a bad string of

17:43.932 --> 17:50.860
maintenance problems. We just had minimum amount 
of maintenance failures and we ended up with a

17:51.700 --> 18:12.403
efficiency rating of 97% at the end of the 12 
months, which is, I've forgotten what the person

17:51.700 --> 18:12.403
said when he told me about it, We eclipsed any other 
American operation in Vietnam by a number of

18:13.025 --> 18:22.159
points. I was really proud to work with guys like 
that that were so dedicated. What were your daily

18:28.789 --> 18:33.356
operations during your squadron? My normal 
operation was down at the office at 7 o'clock in the

18:34.578 --> 18:40.247
morning.

18:42.185 --> 19:10.048
handle the scheduling scheduling problems the 
maintenance problems all the paperwork that

18:42.185 --> 19:10.048
develops in an operation like that being 
available when we had a pre-chef radio contact

18:42.185 --> 19:10.048
with all our aircraft all the way out to Phnom Penh 
and whenever they had a took a hit or or had a main

18:42.185 --> 19:10.048
engine problem or something that was going to give 
them some trouble we were able to go through the

19:11.260 --> 19:40.879
emergency procedures and got them all back in a 
couple times we had to put them in the nom panel

19:11.260 --> 19:40.879
overnight and then send people out to repair the 
airplane and of course we could not and did not stay

19:11.260 --> 19:40.879
overnight in cambodia there was a decree by the 
ambassador there that no military people more

19:11.260 --> 19:40.879
than 18 people assigned would ever be in cambodia 
24 hours so when we airplane go down we had to go in

19:11.260 --> 19:40.879
and work eight hours and come out It added an extra 
load to our operation as anything like that does.

19:47.787 --> 19:55.218
But otherwise, I guess majority, I'd say over half 
of my missions were nighttime missions. After

19:55.238 --> 20:08.959
finishing at about 7 o'clock, I'd get some dinner 
and then either set one of the pilots down and tell

19:55.238 --> 20:08.959
him I was taking his mission or fly along as an 
evaluation. I was also the senior instructor

20:09.513 --> 20:27.707
pilot for the operation, and I had to watch and see 
who was ready to become upgraded to instructor

20:09.513 --> 20:27.707
pilot status, how they were running their crews, 
and sometimes if one of my young line pilots was

20:09.513 --> 20:27.707
looking a little tired, I'd just bump him and take 
his crew and let him get a nice rest extra and seem to

20:28.328 --> 20:36.236
help and keep him in good spirits. What were some of 
the major problems of the combat flying

20:37.738 --> 20:42.622
operations in aircraft maintenance? The 
maintenance problems? Right. Really the old

20:48.609 --> 20:54.955
C-119 was a forgiving old bird if you flew it by the 
manual. One of the biggest problems I had was had

20:58.788 --> 21:28.727
developed three different ways people would try 
to take the aircraft off after if they lost an

20:58.788 --> 21:28.727
engine after decision point and the book was the 
only accurate one you flew it on an exact

20:58.788 --> 21:28.727
acceleration curve climb speed and

20:58.788 --> 21:28.727
vertical velocity

20:58.788 --> 21:28.727
people had generated thought of pulling it off 
early which is always the kiss of death i think and

20:58.788 --> 21:28.727
the other people would leave it on the ground and 
let it wind up high and then pull it up, but you ended

21:29.078 --> 21:44.071
up out of the flying envelope, so to speak, and the 
people before me lost two airplanes. One of the

21:45.412 --> 21:58.883
things I demanded of my pilots, and I jumped up and 
down on the tables, danced, screamed, hollered,

21:45.412 --> 21:58.883
and cried, whatever to do to get them to listen to me 
and to operate the airplane by the book. As long as

22:00.522 --> 22:21.148
we were within legitimate gross weight limits and 
we were very careful about our figuring out our

22:00.522 --> 22:21.148
center of gravity and how much cargo we could carry 
depending on the temperature and what have you and

22:00.522 --> 22:21.148
we would carry that would limit or determine the 
amount of cans of ammunition we'd carry. We'd

22:21.228 --> 22:28.077
carry up sometimes as high as 42 cans of ammunition 
which is a lot of things to fire at the enemy. And we

22:31.423 --> 22:38.031
would offload those as the temperature increased 
and what have you. And I had a couple of young pilots

22:38.651 --> 22:51.145
who were still my friends that were able to bring 
the airplane around, never getting much above 200

22:38.651 --> 22:51.145
or 300 feet, following what the book said. Didn't 
have to dump their ammo cans out for the local Viet

22:51.479 --> 22:58.789
Cong to get hold of, but able to get back in. In fact, 
one young man, Captain Thompson, the first time he

22:58.849 --> 23:07.541
did it, I thought he was going to crash. I happened 
to be watching his takeoff and saw him lose the

23:07.601 --> 23:11.025
engine. And I really chewed his tail up one side, 
down the other when he got it back into the parking

23:11.045 --> 23:19.056
lot. More than one mission had gone by. I think his 
second mission after that he lost an engine on

23:22.286 --> 23:25.290
takeoff. And I also had one of the, I think the bias 
wing commander with him. He made a perfect climb to

23:33.001 --> 23:37.828
altitude back in for a landing. And he was just 
really impressed about how the airplane worked

23:38.509 --> 23:46.140
when you did it exactly right. and that sort of 
convinced people to do what I asked them to do and

23:46.677 --> 24:16.465
not try to improvise and so because of that we never 
had any problems other than the few hits that we

23:46.677 --> 24:16.465
took that were pretty severe battle damage we had a 
couple airplanes that were down for a number of

23:46.677 --> 24:16.465
weeks because of the damage they took but we were 
always able to get them back in safely and without

23:46.677 --> 24:16.465
any injuries or death um were supplies hard to come 
by and if so why well yes like at times uh finding the

24:17.052 --> 24:41.001
right parts for our for our engines were were very 
difficult uh propellers and engine nose cones and

24:17.052 --> 24:41.001
that sort of thing

24:17.052 --> 24:41.001
really are at the At that time, that engine was also 
used in the KT-87 by the Strategic Air Command, so

24:41.200 --> 24:54.054
there was a high demand rate because they had a 
tremendous schedule of flying. Of course, we had

24:54.535 --> 25:10.633
six units with aircraft, 10 aircraft each flying 
in Vietnam on a 24-hour-a-day basis, so you're

24:54.535 --> 25:10.633
really putting time on engines. We were always 
improvising. The Arvin people had C119s down at

25:14.855 --> 25:25.731
the other end of the field, and we did an awful lot of 
under-the-table trading with those guys. It

25:25.851 --> 25:39.912
pretty well equalized out, but they were really 
good at helping us when we just came up to a critical

25:25.851 --> 25:39.912
point and we needed a carburetor or a magneto or 
something, and it wasn't available and it wasn't

25:25.851 --> 25:39.912
going to be in, and we just had to have the aircraft. 
They really helped us out. I guess the key word in a

25:42.608 --> 25:53.100
combat operation in a wartime situation is the 
best grounder is going to have the best outfit. And

25:53.140 --> 25:55.423
we certainly had some of the best there were. We 
became so mobile. We had 17 vehicles when I left

25:58.747 --> 26:00.969
there. And when I arrived, we had three. And so I had 
run a motor pool one time. There were things

26:07.870 --> 26:11.475
available there and how to get them and who to talk 
to. We got the operation going. It was quite a show.

26:18.644 --> 26:21.227
Were there any cases of corruption in the 
squadron? Could you explain?

26:25.613 --> 26:31.320
Mike, I don't know of anything that you could 
classify as corruption. We traded things back in

26:31.360 --> 26:35.245
the fourth. and i wouldn't call that corruption at 
all the the no one ever stole anything if that's

26:36.406 --> 27:06.345
what you're saying now in vietnam there were 
stories about people getting very rich running

26:36.406 --> 27:06.345
officers clubs or nco clubs uh i'm sure selling 
supplies in the black market and what have you and i

26:36.406 --> 27:06.345
know i know that did exist and probably most of the 
people that had been there and left there sold

26:36.406 --> 27:06.345
their little refrigerators on the black market 
when they left the country. Probably a lot of them

27:12.954 --> 27:23.366
sold their cigarettes downtown to make a few bucks 
and I guess that's probably as corrupt as I would

27:12.954 --> 27:23.366
think that anything happened. We did a lot of 
dealing with army groups and we had amazing times

27:23.386 --> 27:34.358
with the things that they gave to us in return. They 
had a real problem because their young troops were

27:35.452 --> 27:42.824
not allowed to buy hard liquor until they were 21 
years old. And the average age of the Army line

27:42.884 --> 27:50.716
troops was probably about 19 years old. And so they 
could only have beer. And if you're out there

27:53.801 --> 27:59.991
getting shot at every day and looking at the guys 
through the jungle, I would think... i don't know

28:01.304 --> 28:24.527
what psychologists have to say about it but you 
sure need some sort of tranquilizer and the only

28:01.304 --> 28:24.527
one that was readily available to everybody was 
drugs of any sort i mean pure heroin marijuana you

28:01.304 --> 28:24.527
know just hold your hand out somebody could put 
some in there but hard whiskey was hard to come by we

28:01.304 --> 28:24.527
all had ration cards and probably were allowed 
more booze than we needed and About once a month,

28:25.047 --> 28:38.339
once every two months, we would collect 
everybody's ration card and go buy two or three

28:25.047 --> 28:38.339
cases of booze, whatever we could dig up with our 
extra tickets, and send them up to our buddies up at

28:25.047 --> 28:38.339
Benoit. And sure enough, in a few days, a case of 
filet mignons would show up on the doorstep or

28:40.101 --> 28:51.932
something like that, and I guess that's 
corruption of sorts, but we thought maybe we were

28:40.101 --> 28:51.932
doing... our bit and of course we were paying for 
our booze out of our pocket to see if we could help

28:52.402 --> 29:20.957
alleviate the situation up there and we would just 
take those steaks and we had a couple of barbecue

28:52.402 --> 29:20.957
pits out back of the operations building and we'd 
stand down for about two hours except for one

28:52.402 --> 29:20.957
airplane that was always in the air and we'd have us 
a big steak fry and have a big time and then we'd go

28:52.402 --> 29:20.957
back to the business we were there for Okay, I see. 
What was the social life like off the base?

29:29.029 --> 29:32.554
Mike, it was a typical wartime situation. The 
crowds there was amazing. Prostitution, of

29:36.900 --> 29:42.508
course, always follows armies everywhere and 
always will. In fact, our enlisted... all lived in

29:47.431 --> 29:50.834
a contract hotel downtown. It would be located 
right in the middle of the prostitution district,

29:51.115 --> 29:59.503
which we always tried to get it changed, but it was 
the best hotel we could get. So the location just

30:00.364 --> 30:02.266
wasn't very good. We had some problems with 
venereal disease. We got to where we called it

30:09.113 --> 30:13.557
Gunner's disease for a while. That was one reason 
why we put the gunners on a 6-1

30:13.992 --> 30:22.021
tour of duty. If we gave them more than one day off, 
we always seemed to have them over in the flight

30:22.742 --> 30:26.926
surgeon's office. So when we stayed on 6-1, they 
never seemed to get there, which I'm not sure where

30:26.946 --> 30:40.020
the cause and effect is, but it sure worked.

30:42.403 --> 30:43.324
Socially, There wasn't a lot of mixing. We turned 
our organization over to the Arvin 30 days after I

30:48.399 --> 31:00.878
left, and I got to know the new squadron commander 
and operations officer very well. The squadron

31:01.699 --> 31:14.458
commander was Vice President Key's personal 
tennis coach and not a very impressive person, but

31:01.699 --> 31:14.458
the operations officer was a young captain who was 
really on the ball. We went out together a couple of

31:14.675 --> 31:40.430
times in Saigon, and of course I had to pass to where 
I could go in civilian clothes any time I wanted to

31:14.675 --> 31:40.430
because I had to be able to check on my people down in 
the area, but it gave me the latitude to go out, look

31:14.675 --> 31:40.430
around the bars and see if our guys were doing 
anything that was distracting. And you need to

31:40.450 --> 31:41.712
stop. Let me finish what I was saying. I'll lead 
right into what you want to talk about. The

31:48.839 --> 31:51.222
operations officer was a nice young man. He took me 
out a couple times and showed me parts of Saigon

31:52.023 --> 31:58.069
that I would never imagine existed. The old 
French-influenced restaurants and places. I've

32:02.915 --> 32:06.519
been to nice restaurants, but nothing like what I 
saw with him. And a whole different establishment

32:06.579 --> 32:14.027
of the sort of upper-crust society. We spent the 
entire time I was there, we were training the Arvin

32:14.294 --> 32:24.086
people to take over our organization, their crew 
members. They were all qualified in the 119, all

32:24.146 --> 32:31.635
their first pilots were. Their co-pilot had 
somewhere between 50 and 150 hours, which in our

32:31.655 --> 32:42.208
system would not even get you out of flying school. 
The first time we allowed one to try to land the

32:43.032 --> 32:47.757
aircraft, it was an exciting experience. Their 
other, you know, their first pilots, their

32:49.459 --> 32:57.788
aircraft commander pilots were pretty 
experienced young men. They knew what they were

32:57.828 --> 33:02.833
doing in the aircraft.

33:03.053 --> 33:09.360
Did the Arvin want to fight during this time? Or did 
they just want to be with their family? You're

33:14.993 --> 33:22.287
getting into a structure, a system that I observed 
and I have my viewpoints on. I'm not sure how

33:22.948 --> 33:24.632
accurate they are. While I was there, we had a six or 
eight of us run at a top floor, you know, call it a

33:25.874 --> 33:34.811
penthouse. It wasn't much of a place, a little 
apartment on top of this building. And it was a

33:38.669 --> 33:41.993
place I used three or four times. And of course, 
every time I was down there to spend the night and

33:42.073 --> 33:58.151
sit there and look out and watch the war and have a 
drink by myself, someone would get in trouble and

33:42.073 --> 33:58.151
get battle damage and they'd have to come dig me out 
of Saigon and bring me back at three o'clock in the

33:42.073 --> 33:58.151
morning. So after about third or fourth try at 
that, I quit doing it. But I got to know the lady that

34:01.574 --> 34:04.798
owned this place. And it seemed to me that The 
majority of the Vietnamese that I met and talked

34:08.369 --> 34:33.839
with through her and the other people that lived in 
that building, they were a very closely knit group

34:08.369 --> 34:33.839
and their area or block or what have you district 
was the most important thing and the rest of the

34:08.369 --> 34:33.839
country be damned. They didn't have the national 
unity that we expect the whole world has. And so we,

34:39.096 --> 34:49.905
at times, I guess, in our political structure and 
our foreign operations, try to dictate what we

34:39.096 --> 34:49.905
think everybody ought to feel. And probably their 
upbringings and social orders and whatever don't

34:49.925 --> 35:01.495
even come close to matching what we expect of them. 
But that was one of the interesting things. I don't

35:05.839 --> 35:06.760
know. The Vietnamese that we trained seemed 
credible. A lot of attitude was hard for us to

35:14.090 --> 35:17.814
understand. But of course, there's so much 
difference in attitude between Westerner and

35:17.854 --> 35:23.461
Easterner. You have to be so delicate in how you 
talk to them. And you can't embarrass an aircraft

35:28.728 --> 35:34.835
commander who makes a bad landing in front of his 
people. I mean, he's lost face completely. You

35:38.212 --> 35:43.598
can't criticize them when you critique their 
flights afterwards. You had to be very careful

35:43.758 --> 35:52.547
about what you said as a group, and individually 
you could take them aside and say, now, these are

35:43.758 --> 35:52.547
the things you probably ought to work on. But you 
couldn't come straight out like you would to an

35:52.567 --> 35:58.593
American serviceman and say, look, you screwed up 
on this. Read the book. Let's sit back and see if we

35:59.934 --> 36:03.578
can get this thing right. because they they just 
didn't operate or think at all the way we did and

36:03.997 --> 36:31.050
though they may be as intelligent or more 
intelligent we are in in many ways our two

36:03.997 --> 36:31.050
civilizations are quite opposed in thoughts and 
how we perceive them um did your opinions of the

36:03.997 --> 36:31.050
vietnamese change over the time period you were 
there

36:34.321 --> 36:37.024
from when you got there and then from when you left?

36:39.968 --> 36:42.691
Mike, a lot of things changed in my mind. I remember 
in 1967, I believe that was the time of melee, 67,

36:42.871 --> 37:02.775
68, something like that, when I was flying B-58s 
and a friend of mine who had flown B-58s had been to

36:42.871 --> 37:02.775
Vietnam for

36:42.871 --> 37:02.775
a combat tour in the line 105

37:03.397 --> 37:33.083
had been there doing uh may line and i really don't 
remember the year of may lie what have you but i do

37:03.397 --> 37:33.083
remember being very opinionated about how 
terrible i thought that they'd go out and shoot

37:03.397 --> 37:33.083
women and children and this guy who i respect a 
great deal looked at me and said bill

37:03.397 --> 37:33.083
if you haven't been there you don't know what 
you're talking about And after being there, I can

37:33.400 --> 37:45.772
understand the things that motivated those 
people to do the things that we call war

37:33.400 --> 37:45.772
atrocities. I suppose the reason why we didn't get 
to have Nuremberg trials in World War II is because

37:46.673 --> 37:53.700
we were the winners. If we had lost, we had as many 
war atrocities happening by our own military

37:54.021 --> 38:03.390
people. In everyday life, the brutality of people 
can exhibit to each other. I don't suppose down

38:09.225 --> 38:14.913
deep inside we're much different than the German 
soldiers were or what have you. But those young

38:15.574 --> 38:31.335
kids and women would kill you just as soon as, if 
they were on drugs or were dedicated to the Viet

38:15.574 --> 38:31.335
Cong or whatever they believed in, they were going 
to throw a hand grenade at you. shoot you down with a

38:31.940 --> 38:34.903
gun as quickly as anybody else. My view of what was 
going on in the war and the area changed. My feeling

38:41.408 --> 38:51.557
for Vietnamese people

38:41.408 --> 38:51.557
has never been any other than they're a country 
that deserved to be a country. They're nice

38:51.837 --> 38:57.482
people. I don't know any Vietnamese now from the 
war. Most of my work was over in Cambodia, so I'm

39:01.336 --> 39:06.323
more familiar with those folks. They

39:06.624 --> 39:10.730
had a tough life. We were dictating Western ideas 
to them. Obviously, their leaders were quite

39:17.039 --> 39:21.806
corrupt. Vice President Key certainly was.

39:26.581 --> 39:32.009
They were making millions and millions of dollars 
out of the war, and it certainly wasn't helping the

39:26.581 --> 39:32.009
people. Did they want to fight? I don't know. They 
had somebody there to fight for them the whole

39:34.452 --> 39:36.616
time. Why should they fight? But that country, the 
history of that area, has been 3,000 years of

39:38.498 --> 39:44.847
continuous conflict. There's never been a 
peaceful time. Probably today in the last year has

39:47.892 --> 39:53.500
probably been one of the more peaceful eras of 
their existence. There had been constant

39:53.716 --> 39:56.760
conflict in that area forever.

39:59.985 --> 40:02.909
So fighting is part of their existence. See, in 
your opinion, why did we lose the war? Well, that's

40:10.260 --> 40:16.228
not my opinion anymore than anybody else's, but we 
didn't lose the war. We weren't there to win it is

40:16.309 --> 40:18.692
our problem. As any time when you have And this is 
speaking as a military person. And I don't believe

40:26.522 --> 40:31.670
in a lot of the things that I went there believing in 
back in 1970. But the people that try to run the

40:31.910 --> 40:48.074
military machine as politicians, they don't 
understand what the operation has to be about. And

40:48.254 --> 40:51.178
so you can't set a bunch of rules on yourself and 
fight against somebody that has no rules and no

40:51.547 --> 40:56.334
boundaries. We were limited. We couldn't cross 
the DMZ. We couldn't legally go out of Vietnam. So

41:02.042 --> 41:03.684
they could go in and out. They could regroup any 
place on the other side of the fence, and we were

41:04.165 --> 41:11.716
restricted from doing anything about it. If we 
beat them, we couldn't take that territory. Out in

41:17.344 --> 41:19.427
Cambodia, if we... won that battle, we had to go 
back home again. We couldn't stay in there and take

41:25.244 --> 41:27.127
it away from them. And you can't win a war. It's the 
same as we established in the Korean War. If you

41:31.332 --> 41:41.744
limit yourself by a boundary and the other people 
have no boundaries that they have to be limited by,

41:31.332 --> 41:41.744
then they can have all their munitions and all 
their supplies there and just move in and out. And

41:41.824 --> 41:46.890
so it's not the same kind of fire rules. And there's 
a war of attrition. So what was the answer? The

41:52.188 --> 41:58.698
politicians say, okay, turn the Army and the Air 
Force loose and let them just take over the area.

42:00.080 --> 42:04.226
Would that have started World War III with China? 
Who knows? But the mission we had there was one of

42:04.767 --> 42:10.315
containment, and you can't win that. I mean, it's 
just, it's not possible. So you get your people

42:13.576 --> 42:21.544
killed for trying to defend a piece of real estate, 
and they come in there and shoot at you and then go

42:13.576 --> 42:21.544
back home. They're always fighting you and your 
vocation. It's a heck of a way, and that's why there

42:27.390 --> 42:36.959
were so many hard feelings and why after 11 months I 
woke up one day and said, geez, nothing's changed.

42:36.999 --> 42:38.040
11 months had gone by. We shot a lot of ammunition. 
We've killed a lot of the enemy. We've done as good

42:42.511 --> 42:48.218
as we can, and nothing's changed. We're still 
doing the same thing we were the first day I was

42:48.238 --> 42:50.841
here. So we felt like we weren't ever gaining on 
them. I see. I'm going to ask you just one last

42:56.947 --> 42:59.710
question. What impact did Vietnam have on your 
life during and after the war?

43:08.943 --> 43:11.166
Mike, it's a hard question to ask. During the war, 
it was something I trained for for 16 years. I was a

43:16.535 --> 43:19.880
professional military person, a pilot. I guess I 
flew 24 different aircraft in my career. I had been

43:25.509 --> 43:30.977
to a number of combat schools. I was finally 
putting to work something that I trained for for

43:31.859 --> 43:36.486
years. It was a real, I guess you want to call it a 
macho man's world, a man's existence. The men

43:44.416 --> 43:45.357
rule. It was an interesting, interesting thing 
and an experience I would not like to repeat, but I

43:45.457 --> 44:02.575
darn sure wouldn't want to have missed it after the 
war or after my experience there. I sort of put it in

44:04.192 --> 44:06.975
my hip pocket. I guess I've talked about being in 
Vietnam 20 times since I've been there. I don't

44:16.023 --> 44:17.565
talk about it very much. Only when someone asks me 
to recount something about it. But except when I

44:21.348 --> 44:27.654
get with my old buddies sometimes when we have 
reunions, then we might talk about it. But just

44:27.674 --> 44:31.177
everyday conversation, I really don't have a lot 
to say. It has not affected me. one way or another. I

44:36.742 --> 44:49.194
was awarded a DFC for killing a number of Viet Cong 
on a mission and getting the airplane back with

44:36.742 --> 44:49.194
some pretty good battle damage. I kill people that 
it doesn't bother me. It was a thing that they were

44:53.298 --> 44:59.764
trying to kill me and I was trying to keep these 
other people alive so I figured it was a The thing

45:00.031 --> 45:05.900
we're all there for, as far as affecting my life, I 
don't think we've ever done that or ever will. I

45:07.242 --> 45:13.331
felt I did it with honor and dignity, and if you do 
that, I think you can survive it. I can't tell you

45:13.351 --> 45:20.843
what the people that were in the lines out in the 
jungle experienced, because that was a whole

45:13.351 --> 45:20.843
different world. We went out on our missions, 
fought, came back, had a few beers, went to sleep on

45:20.903 --> 45:28.755
air conditioning, BOQ with clean sheets. How can 
you compare that with a guy that's living out in a

45:32.777 --> 45:37.542
foxhole someplace? I'm sure he's got a completely 
different attitude on what it did for him then and

45:37.562 --> 45:47.493
in years to come. And it's obvious in some of the 
things you see happening so many years later with

45:47.553 --> 45:55.502
people that were in the trenches, so to speak, 
still having serious problems. All right. Thank

46:01.399 --> 46:02.603
you, Dr. Greger. I appreciate your time.
