WEBVTT

00:04.165 --> 00:24.684
with the different presidents and chancellors, 
there were no sharp changes in the way the office

00:04.165 --> 00:24.684
operated, except gradually became more

00:04.165 --> 00:24.684
demanding in terms of the high school record and so 
forth. Can you think of any decisions that now,

00:25.425 --> 00:31.270
with the gift of hindsight, that might have been 
made that would have improved anything?

00:40.392 --> 00:41.413
Entirely your opinion. Not really. I'm going back 
to thinking about the changes that we made. I think

00:49.020 --> 01:01.071
that, and this is from a management standpoint, 
the biggest changes that we made was instituting

00:49.020 --> 01:01.071
the Student Management Information System, 
SIMS, I think we call it. in which the whole record,

01:01.675 --> 01:11.293
the admissions and records keeping thing was, I 
would say, computerized, to use a better word on

01:01.675 --> 01:11.293
the thing. But it's a process in which the 
application, from application to graduation is

01:11.894 --> 01:23.717
now kept in a uniform records system which you can 
follow the student from the very beginning until

01:24.288 --> 01:29.373
the time that they graduate. It was quite 
interesting how we came about selecting a

01:29.733 --> 01:40.063
particular process because when we started doing 
this, we were way behind the curve, so to speak.

01:40.083 --> 01:42.425
Many schools already had this in operation. We 
opted to not go into it at the very beginning, I

01:42.525 --> 01:51.493
suppose, because we wanted to We were satisfied. 
We had a system which was working well, although it

01:52.993 --> 01:57.239
was a little bit cumbersome, but it was working 
well. And we decided to let it wait a while. And I

02:00.784 --> 02:08.994
don't recall the time, but it seemed like around 
1985 was probably when we started the SYMS system

02:00.784 --> 02:08.994
at that time. And we, at that time, visited a number 
of vendors, and it was interesting to see their

02:09.095 --> 02:19.168
proposals and programs and everything. got the 
operation. It took us about a year to really get the

02:20.577 --> 02:26.306
programming and everything done. It was a major 
undertaking, but really well planned through the

02:26.346 --> 02:37.223
computer system, computer department, I guess it 
was. And we had great cooperation and everything,

02:37.243 --> 02:44.054
and it worked, as I recall, really fairly well from 
the very beginning. I don't think we had many

02:44.114 --> 02:46.438
hitches because we had planned and worked so hard 
on it and laying good foundation with it. Were

02:50.461 --> 02:55.868
there any heroes or heroines that were supporters 
of that decision to bring it about? Anybody that

02:57.009 --> 02:59.572
deserves a pat on the back for supporting it? Oh, I 
suppose, and for the life of me right now, I can't

03:02.095 --> 03:13.388
remember who

03:02.095 --> 03:13.388
was our biggest supporter at that particular 
time. I was thinking about Dr. Gage being in the

03:14.026 --> 03:20.254
office, but I'm not sure he was in the office at that 
time in the Vice President's office. Dean Gage?

03:20.915 --> 03:21.575
Dean Gage.

03:24.459 --> 03:36.634
He may have been there, but I do remember that we had 
great support as far as getting people set up to

03:24.459 --> 03:36.634
help us implement the system and everything. I 
don't know who to give the credit to. Bob Lacey, you

03:39.838 --> 03:41.360
probably know more than I. Bob was in charge of the 
getting the whole thing, coordinating the whole

03:44.097 --> 03:52.649
thing, and he did an excellent job from his 
standpoint on the thing. We had good cooperation

03:52.669 --> 04:02.342
from, again, other people, as I say, getting staff 
set up in the SEM's office and so forth, and it

03:52.669 --> 04:02.342
worked well. We would have never made it without 
it. Who else are scattered around the campus were

04:04.330 --> 04:10.439
good supporters of the work that you and your 
associates? Well, I always felt like the best

04:11.320 --> 04:16.267
support we had came from the associate dean within 
the college. I forgot the term. It wasn't academic

04:21.074 --> 04:22.396
council. It was the academic operations 
committee, I believe was the term. But that was a

04:28.004 --> 04:31.148
group I always enjoyed working with. They gave us 
great support, and we try to give them great

04:31.465 --> 04:36.713
support in working with their students on the 
back. Who were your favorites in that group? Oh,

04:39.156 --> 04:41.259
goodness. You have favorites, and you have some 
that are not favorites. No, but you can mention the

04:43.823 --> 04:45.285
favorites. I

04:45.365 --> 04:51.635
really enjoyed working with all the associate 
deans. I don't know that I would want to select one

04:51.835 --> 04:54.759
over the other. They were all great. great people 
to work with and, you know, additional staff in

04:55.850 --> 04:58.633
there. We mentioned Dale Noble a while ago. Dale 
was on there and people from the academic testing

05:00.574 --> 05:06.460
office were on there. It's just a great group to 
work with. Alright, in your own personal

05:10.023 --> 05:17.730
recollection, what are some of your proudest 
moments of the years you worked at A&M?

05:24.176 --> 05:25.097
I think that the The nicest thing that I had is I had a 
great staff to work with the whole time I was there.

05:31.259 --> 05:39.850
You mentioned Ms. Mitchell, Mr. Gilwood, Mr. 
Harvey Strigler, Ms. Luna Dean, they were the four

05:31.259 --> 05:39.850
heads of my department. And Ms. Jean Ringer, we 
added the international on later on. And they were

05:44.537 --> 05:45.899
the heads of the departments. They were just 
exceptional to work with.

05:51.065 --> 05:57.291
I think the greatest accomplishment that we had 
that really helped us more was getting CEMS in

05:51.065 --> 05:57.291
operation. Because, I mean, we were floundering 
as far as paperwork was concerned. It used to be

06:02.756 --> 06:10.403
when early days, if you wanted to look for a file, if 
you called for it and got it within 30 minutes or an

06:02.756 --> 06:10.403
hour, you were lucky. After we got CEMS in, if we 
called it up and it wasn't on the screen in five or

06:11.544 --> 06:20.312
ten seconds, we thought, my goodness, it's 
terrible because it's so slow.

06:22.722 --> 06:34.661
We had,

06:22.722 --> 06:34.661
again, most of the time the office was, the work 
which we did was just great. I had often mentioned

06:34.861 --> 06:48.983
to people, you know, I really never looked for a, in 
moving to another director's admission job,

06:34.861 --> 06:48.983
because I didn't think it was any better than what I 
had here. We were very fortunate in that as we grew,

06:49.469 --> 06:55.217
we had facilities to take care of the students. We 
had a good building program there, but we didn't

06:55.237 --> 07:00.685
have to cut back on the enrollment too early on. 
Eventually, we got to the point where we did. And

07:02.488 --> 07:04.771
once you get to that point, it gets a whole lot 
tougher. I enjoyed the freedom, which I always

07:04.791 --> 07:11.361
felt I had, to make the decisions, to run the office 
and everything. I appreciate Ed's guidance there

07:11.381 --> 07:19.172
and Gary's whenever he came and took over. a very 
enjoyable experience. Again, it would be hard to

07:21.516 --> 07:28.542
name the people that you enjoy working with 
because there were so many. Do you remember any

07:28.562 --> 07:33.567
particular events that you're delighted that you 
were there to witness? Any kind of event? Were

07:37.870 --> 07:45.097
involved in missions or not?

07:45.117 --> 07:48.940
Gosh, I don't know what that would have been. As we 
mentioned a while ago, I always went to

07:49.460 --> 07:51.522
graduation. I missed one graduation, I think, in 
22 years. That was because I was sick. But I always

07:59.131 --> 08:08.562
had a part in the graduation ceremony, and 
therefore I went to, whether we had three a year or

07:59.131 --> 08:08.562
whether we had seven a year, I went to every one of 
them. And that's one thing I always enjoyed going

08:08.582 --> 08:11.085
to. I don't think I... They never feel any 
resentment as part of the job, but I really, I

08:13.270 --> 08:19.236
probably would have gone otherwise, I think. But I 
really enjoyed that, just to see the students, the

08:19.296 --> 08:30.987
parents, and the faculty members that did too, and 
the joy of seeing them reach their goal and getting

08:19.296 --> 08:30.987
there as one with me and them. Okay. What advice 
would you give to current and future AM

08:32.849 --> 08:39.615
administrators about commencements? I think the 
greatest thing we do is having it like we do, where

08:41.080 --> 08:54.054
the student gets their diploma, walks across the 
stage, gets recognition from parents, fellow

08:41.080 --> 08:54.054
classmates, and faculty. I think this is the best 
thing we do. I got my master's and doctorate from

08:57.517 --> 09:07.628
another institution, and it was a stand up and sit 
down affair. I think it's just one of the nicest

09:08.502 --> 09:23.256
things we do to let the parents have the experience 
of seeing their son or daughter receive their

09:08.502 --> 09:23.256
diploma from an individual president of the 
university in this case. And I think they leave

09:23.276 --> 09:33.745
that last official act in their relation with A&M, 
I think the whole family leaves there feeling

09:23.276 --> 09:33.745
good. They've got the diploma, they don't have a 
facsimile, they've got the real diploma. One of

09:38.624 --> 09:51.116
the little touches that Dr. Williams used to do 
that I copied wherever I went was near the end when

09:38.624 --> 09:51.116
he would ask the parents of the first generation 
graduates to stand. And that was always touching

09:52.157 --> 10:06.150
because you'd see some women reaching for their 
handkerchief to dry a tear because I am one of those

09:52.157 --> 10:06.150
and I know how special it was to my parents that I got 
to go to college. Let's see, anything that you can

10:07.008 --> 10:12.474
think of that you would change, you would have 
changed? Oh, there's probably a lot of things I

10:14.176 --> 10:17.861
would have changed and done differently. But I've 
always, I view it just like I did with a lot of

10:18.522 --> 10:23.207
things, kind of raising new kids. I think I did the 
best I could under the circumstances with the

10:23.928 --> 10:29.234
knowledge I had at that time. Are there any 
organizational changes or...

10:36.269 --> 10:47.499
decision path changes, you'd...

10:47.519 --> 10:55.906
There are, again, a lot of different ways you can 
decide on, if you're talking about the admissions

10:47.519 --> 10:55.906
process, how you can do it.

10:59.609 --> 11:01.731
Like, where does that report now? It reports... Is 
it still academic? Still reporting to the It's

11:05.530 --> 11:06.431
still academic. It's still courts of the provost, 
and I think that's where it should be. I think it's

11:09.195 --> 11:13.840
an academic function, and I think it should be 
following that. I think it's at the provost level

11:14.541 --> 11:18.747
is probably appropriate. I don't think it should 
be at the president's level. I think he's got other

11:20.389 --> 11:22.151
things to deal with.

11:25.095 --> 11:32.584
I think that the organization which we had with the 
dean and the admissions and the registrar work

11:32.851 --> 11:33.792
fine. There may be times when it would be better, 
and it depended on what the dean's function is,

11:33.892 --> 11:46.048
whether it would be better or whether to have an 
admissions and reporting directly to the provost

11:33.892 --> 11:46.048
and a registrar. I didn't have any strong feelings 
on that.

11:51.935 --> 11:54.358
Let's see, we're getting near the end. Let's make 
believe that somebody gave you a lot of money that

12:02.281 --> 12:17.575
you are to give to A&M

12:02.281 --> 12:17.575
a lot of money, hundreds of thousands of dollars, 
but you decide what it's going to be used for, what

12:02.281 --> 12:17.575
would you direct it to? Where would you put it and 
for what purpose?

12:24.962 --> 12:29.486
My personal feeling is it should probably go to 
scholarships. Based on? not necessarily

12:31.019 --> 12:32.581
academics. I mean, academic is a priority on the 
thing. But there are many students, I think, here

12:37.669 --> 12:43.257
who could do a whole lot better if they had a little 
financial aid. And I would be looking to try to help

12:44.299 --> 12:48.225
those. I think that Are you saying more 
opportunity awards? The opportunity award type

12:52.753 --> 12:55.015
scholarship, yeah. Those students who have 
proven ability, lack of cash, and other support

12:55.135 --> 13:05.247
possibly on the thing, which would help those out. 
That's my, not my pet peeve, but that's my concern

13:05.368 --> 13:10.554
for a lot of students. Would you restrict it as to 
major? Would you link it to any particular major?

13:15.239 --> 13:18.323
No, I wouldn't link it to major because I've seen 
too many students change too many majors. Uh,

13:18.742 --> 13:27.752
they, you know, students coming in, they just 
don't have enough experience to know what they

13:18.742 --> 13:27.752
want to be their major. And, you know, on a related 
subject, they are, for that reason, I think

13:28.432 --> 13:43.068
there's some merit in university colleges and 
some other things of that nature, which you, it can

13:28.432 --> 13:43.068
keep students, I think, from feeling, quote, that 
they're a failure because they got in the wrong

13:28.432 --> 13:43.068
field. Uh, having been in the wrong field myself at 
one time, I can have some sympathy for that. All

13:48.323 --> 14:05.002
right, can you share with this machine any amusing 
flubs, goofs that you can remember that you or

13:48.323 --> 14:05.002
somebody else on the staff did that were in 
hindsight funny, amusing?

14:07.765 --> 14:13.932
Something got lost for six months or somebody sent 
the wrong thing to somebody? No, at the time I can

14:14.913 --> 14:17.976
think it probably was funny, I think. I only 
remember one thing, I think early on I made some

14:18.192 --> 14:36.577
kind of a dumb decision about not admitting some 
kid, and one of my staff members convinced me I

14:18.192 --> 14:36.577
probably should have, and I remember going out the 
door trying to find the kid, of course I never could

14:18.192 --> 14:36.577
find him, but by that time he was long gone, I think. 
Alright, Aggie stories. Can you think of a kind of a

14:41.404 --> 14:46.731
poignant story to share? It'll get recorded.

14:59.377 --> 15:00.459
Stories I don't remember. What's your favorite? I 
can remember kids. I can remember what they did. I

15:07.066 --> 15:08.548
can remember whatever else. Trying to remember 
their names was the hardest thing in the world for

15:08.588 --> 15:10.951
me. But I can tell you, a kid can come in a year later 
and I can say, you came from so-and-so, you did

15:10.971 --> 15:16.077
this, you did that. but I couldn't remember what 
his name was. All right, what about, what's your

15:18.467 --> 15:22.231
favorite Aggie funny story? You've got to have a 
favorite that you enjoy telling. Well, let me go

15:26.254 --> 15:28.797
back one other instance. I can tell you one thing, 
which it tells you you never know what's going to

15:28.857 --> 15:33.761
happen. Last spring at a baseball game out here, I 
was going to a baseball game, a young man came up to

15:33.782 --> 15:41.008
me and he says, hello, Dr. Lay. He says, you don't 
remember me. My name is, and I think it was His last

15:45.385 --> 15:47.408
name was Castro, and I can't even remember. But he 
says that I still remember when you helped me get

15:47.969 --> 15:52.195
into A&M. He says, and then I, we started to 
remember, because he had worked in the shop, and he

15:52.215 --> 15:58.223
had a shop smith, and I had a shop smith. So we began 
to get that, and I remember, and he is now head of, I

15:58.243 --> 16:06.355
think, the vocational technical program for the 
state of Texas. I forget what it was. But I... He had

16:10.445 --> 16:18.215
not met admission requirements, and he was a local 
boy from Bryan, and we talked for a while and said,

16:10.445 --> 16:18.215
well, we'll just see what you can do. And that was 
one of my better choices, I think. I made a good

16:21.719 --> 16:23.241
decision on that. When you were getting down to the 
decision on those marginal admits, Did you want

16:31.370 --> 16:33.432
there to be a face-to-face? Well, yeah, I always 
wanted to. There was not always that. I realize

16:38.336 --> 16:40.058
sometimes distance would... Right. But I always 
wanted a kid to come in, and I could talk to him

16:40.638 --> 16:50.127
man-to-man, man-to-woman, whatever the case may 
be on the thing. It helped when you can talk to them,

16:50.347 --> 16:52.329
I think. It gives them a chance to present their 
side of the story. A lot of times, I thought the best

16:55.752 --> 16:59.956
decision was, no, not now. Mm-hmm. But again, the 
philosophy was we're not denying you admission to

17:00.698 --> 17:07.147
A&M. We're trying to give you a route that you can 
graduate from A&M. And I think as long as we used

17:11.573 --> 17:20.504
that, for the most part, the students left 
reasonably satisfied. Obviously, they wanted to

17:20.525 --> 17:23.909
come or they wouldn't have made the effort to even 
come for an interview. But that's the philosophy

17:24.870 --> 17:29.136
we tried to follow. What else should we, have we 
left anything out that we should have covered? I

17:33.544 --> 17:35.266
don't know of anything. I think we've covered a 
whole lot more than I thought we were going to.

17:38.830 --> 17:39.110
Alright. My problem is I don't remember a lot of 
stories on the things. Alright, let's conclude

17:42.414 --> 17:43.935
with this. As you look back now, those 22 years, 
what do you think was your responsibility?

17:53.505 --> 17:56.929
What role do you think you and your staff played for 
Texas A&M?

18:00.993 --> 18:14.410
I think that our role was to try to select a group of 
students who could come in to Texas A&M and be

18:00.993 --> 18:14.410
successful. Successful in this sense was that 
they could receive their bachelor's degree from

18:14.431 --> 18:21.980
Texas A&M. Any other success they have might be, 
that's up to them. But what we wanted to do and what

18:25.885 --> 18:30.932
we would like to do is to select X number of students 
and four years later have them receive their

18:31.756 --> 18:35.801
bachelor's degree. That's not realistic for a lot 
of reasons, I think. But we felt like our job was to

18:39.224 --> 18:50.877
try to select students who could

18:39.224 --> 18:50.877
best use the facilities which we had here. That is, 
they could profit by the faculty, they could

18:51.458 --> 19:00.328
profit by living here, all the other things which 
go to make up the education process. Did anybody at

19:00.494 --> 19:08.688
any other group at A&M have any responsibility 
more important than the one y'all had? Well, I

19:10.993 --> 19:14.399
think that the faculty had a tremendous 
responsibility once we got them here. But was it

19:14.899 --> 19:17.063
more important than y'all's? See, I think y'all 
were the quality controllers. Well, I think that
