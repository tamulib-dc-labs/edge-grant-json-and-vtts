00:01.702 --> 00:12.096
You were telling me about working and going to 
school and how you, how you, you know, can do

00:01.702 --> 00:12.096
something for yourself if you really take the 
opportunity.

00:17.203 --> 00:18.785
That was going to give you something. Oh, yeah, 
but, yes. The trouble has been also in the

00:22.430 --> 00:31.101
educational circles of the Anglo-American that 
the writers of history have not written the truth

00:31.351 --> 01:00.598
have slanted the historical events to their own 
liking and even their school taxes texts and books

00:31.351 --> 01:00.598
they have had misinformation

00:31.351 --> 01:00.598
particularly by some individual who was not at all 
adequately prepared to write in the textbooks for

01:01.355 --> 01:09.828
the state of Texas. I remember distinctly,

01:11.110 --> 01:28.476
I think it was in the fifth grade, and I was in, I 
think in Bailey School, in which the teacher got me

01:11.110 --> 01:28.476
to stand up to read a joke from the geography 
textbook furnished by the school system in the

01:28.962 --> 01:40.815
discussion of Texas. It says, Texas has great 
centers of education and industry. To wit,

01:51.706 --> 01:58.193
Dallas, Houston, San Antonio, in El Paso. But El 
Paso, San Antonio

02:02.431 --> 02:18.513
is

02:02.431 --> 02:18.513
troubled because of the racial condition. The 
population, a great part of the population of San

02:19.915 --> 02:29.007
Antonio and El Paso are Mexicans, and they are 
ignorant and illiterate.

02:40.265 --> 02:47.712
The teacher said, Frank, you don't want to be 
ignorant, and you don't want to be illiterate, do

02:40.265 --> 02:47.712
you, Frank? I said, no, and I think this book is a big 
liar. And I threw it down. I was in Bailey School.

03:00.256 --> 03:09.249
When I was probably in the fifth grade, the 
teacher, Mrs. Lapp, asked me to stand up and read

03:00.256 --> 03:09.249
out to the class. What did she say when you threw it 
down? She said I was a bad boy.

03:19.102 --> 03:23.769
How much of the problem has been in the school 
teachers, do you think? Were they Did they just not

03:25.602 --> 03:31.587
know anything, or were they unaware of the 
background? Some of those crude teachers were

03:31.908 --> 03:39.675
within the category that I have mentioned before, 
carpetbaggers and scalawags. This is when you say

03:40.576 --> 03:42.938
the trouble really began. You don't think there 
was that much problem between the Anglos and the

03:42.978 --> 03:53.027
people who had come, well, who were there to begin 
with from Mexico prior to the Civil War? I don't

03:53.294 --> 03:54.575
think there was. I think the Civil War was a factor 
by the migration of the citizens from the north or

03:54.596 --> 04:18.964
unethical citizens that wanted to usurp the areas 
or wanted to not only usurp but wanted to take

04:19.265 --> 04:47.955
advantage of the situation and enrich themselves 
probably through economic means gradually

04:19.265 --> 04:47.955
started developing a inferior

04:19.265 --> 04:47.955
type of class of citizens than they themselves 
because they were the conquering type we had been

04:19.265 --> 04:47.955
subjugated to their whims and desires Now, I think 
that continued to go on. And, of course, the

04:54.233 --> 05:11.713
descendants of these people took it for granted 
that the philosophies of the

04:54.233 --> 05:11.713
individuals before their ancestors was right. 
And that there was a class distinction in Texas and

05:13.355 --> 05:19.782
El Paso When

05:20.909 --> 05:41.887
I was going to the university,

05:20.909 --> 05:41.887
I would come to El Paso for the summer vacations, 
and I got me a job as a traveling salesman

05:20.909 --> 05:41.887
with a local clothing store. And I made a trip from 
El Paso to Alpine. From Alpine, I went, I think, to a

05:52.195 --> 06:01.524
little to the north, Odessa, ranking.

06:04.767 --> 06:18.981
And what was the name

06:04.767 --> 06:18.981
of that large city in comparison to the other 
little towns? What was the name of that city?

06:22.672 --> 06:24.895
Anyway, I went to a hotel.

06:27.659 --> 06:30.303
And I registered. And the individual at this hotel 
told me that because of the Cattlemen's

06:30.323 --> 06:40.056
Convention, there was no room available.

06:45.063 --> 06:47.226
So I inquired as to what to do. Finally, he 
suggested that I should go to a Protestant

06:53.823 --> 06:59.871
preacher's home, but he had a room available for 
me. So I went to this Protestant, I don't know

07:01.854 --> 07:09.585
whether he was a Methodist preacher or a Baptist. 
And they were waiting for me, and they gave me

07:11.368 --> 07:20.000
shelter and made me feel at home.

07:23.425 --> 07:23.745
Then Later, I went downtown. I was peddling as a 
drummer, clothing, men's clothing.

07:38.997 --> 07:50.408
And finally it dawned on me later on that the reason 
I didn't get a hotel room was because of racial

07:38.997 --> 07:50.408
discrimination. Well, how did they identify you 
as being Mexican American? I don't know, I guess,

07:55.662 --> 08:00.366
the manner in which I was dressed, prepared. I 
found probably that I was a peddler and looking for

08:01.207 --> 08:10.075
the Mexican customers. And we were in the business 
of selling exclusively to the young Mexican

08:11.496 --> 08:21.205
individuals. And what were they doing in that 
particular area around Odessa? What was their

08:25.418 --> 08:28.380
livelihood, these customers? Employees,

08:28.701 --> 08:33.585
working people. What's the name of that city? San 
Angelo? No. It's between

08:40.571 --> 08:51.040
north of Vegas. And I mean north of

08:51.678 --> 09:03.872
Alpine, between Pecos and Alpine.

09:09.538 --> 09:11.861
I can't even think of a city in that area. I'll look 
on the map. Cattle, cattle country. Anyway, all

09:17.327 --> 09:19.069
along, That line from Odessa, not Odessa, Pecos, 
not Pecos either. But there are two different

09:28.193 --> 09:34.661
fields of travel. The southern and the center 
route. Not Odessa, but Ranking, whatever the

09:38.105 --> 09:45.394
other, Ranking, Texas, another town.

09:49.357 --> 09:59.169
All along that area, the oiled country, in one of 
the railroad stations, they had a sign. Negro and

10:00.030 --> 10:07.238
Mexican don't let the sun set on your head here.

10:07.258 --> 10:16.950
That was in 1928, 30, 19...

10:20.879 --> 10:26.244
And by 1933, I saw that. Now, in Pecos, also, 
there's a lot of racial discrimination.

10:33.751 --> 10:36.173
Outspoken racial discrimination. And it was so 
much worse at the early days, or right before the

10:37.995 --> 10:48.304
World War II. Well,

10:49.617 --> 11:09.938
I'm wondering how much of this do you suppose was 
related to the very large number of people who did

10:49.617 --> 11:09.938
come in from Mexico? From 1910 on up through the 
early 1940s, was there a fear or a feeling of being

11:11.099 --> 11:21.609
threatened by the large number of immigrants? Or 
do you think this was immaterial? I think that was

11:25.933 --> 11:28.816
immaterial about what they felt. Here's the 
reason of the influx or increase of the Mexican

11:29.056 --> 11:38.845
population in the United States. We had, during 
World War I, scarcity of employees. And the same

11:50.278 --> 11:53.884
thing took place in World War II. The United States 
had to import

11:54.845 --> 12:07.583
railroad trackmen, and they used to call them the 
ring duchies, through El Paso. to the eastern part

12:08.305 --> 12:37.924
and central part of the united states as far as 
chicago now chicago has a big mexican colony

12:08.305 --> 12:37.924
because during the two wars the united states was 
in dire need of labor class of people and they

12:08.305 --> 12:37.924
imported these labors from mexico and the labors 
that were imported in the into the United States

12:38.191 --> 12:48.340
during those areas or eras were people of low 
educational attainments. They were very

12:50.242 --> 12:58.429
distinguishable in their appearance from the 
rest of the inhabitants of the United States. They

12:59.751 --> 13:07.978
were very easy identifiable by the manner in which 
they dressed and where they lived And

13:09.207 --> 13:35.333
consequently, that phase of our history gave rise 
to the superiority or a feeling of superiority by

13:09.207 --> 13:35.333
those Anglo-Americans who had been in the United 
States and saw these coolies, these track

13:09.207 --> 13:35.333
laborers, uneducated bunch of people swarming 
into the cities of the United States.

13:43.270 --> 14:04.729
Consequently, that appearance gave these people 
a brand of inferior people, of ignorant, of

13:43.270 --> 14:04.729
laborers, of that which was part of a second class 
of our society. But then this has been applied or

14:05.215 --> 14:12.133
was applied generally to anyone who was of Mexican 
descent, regardless of? I would think so. The

14:14.259 --> 14:20.355
majority of that feeling came about into 
existence by those conditions.

14:23.238 --> 14:43.018
So you really have the two factors then, the 
post-Civil War reaction, the attempt to

14:23.238 --> 14:43.018
subjugate people, and then added to that the large 
number of laborers who then, as a group, everyone

14:23.238 --> 14:43.018
was identified with that particular group. In the 
employment of these laboring groups from Mexico,

14:43.038 --> 14:51.507
they were segregated into a particular area. And 
they were given homes or places in which to live or

14:52.752 --> 15:01.964
bunk houses of an inferior quality. And 
consequently, the other people who would see that

15:04.087 --> 15:20.228
would take it for granted that they were slaves, 
they were under

15:04.087 --> 15:20.228
class of a type of an underclass of people. Well, 
it's

15:21.035 --> 15:31.890
beginning to get late, but I would like to finish 
just getting my record down here on your

15:21.035 --> 15:31.890
particular family. You say your mother's family 
all stayed in Mexico, the Matas. The Matas family

15:35.956 --> 15:37.998
all remained in Mexico. Do you ever visit back and 
forth with these cousins? Some of these Matas have

15:40.983 --> 15:45.529
migrated into the United States.

15:49.234 --> 15:49.995
Did they come here? After, yes. After the

15:51.741 --> 15:57.507
end of the revolution. Were they pretty well wiped 
out financially by the revolution? Oh, yes. The

16:04.094 --> 16:15.325
majority of his other relatives, when they came to 
the United States, they had very, very small, if I

16:16.182 --> 16:25.875
would say economically, broke.

16:28.378 --> 16:34.265
And then, were there any other children on your 
father's side, or was it just Guadalupe Galvan?

16:34.285 --> 16:44.839
Guadalupe and Blas, B-L-A-S Galvan, and they had 
a, he was, he entered the United States Sometime

16:45.848 --> 17:02.208
after we came here and

16:45.848 --> 17:02.208
went to New Mexico, married,

16:45.848 --> 17:02.208
and died in New Mexico. Not any issue. Did he come? 
He came during the revolution, though. Yes, he

17:06.713 --> 17:09.697
came during the revolution. And then in your 
family, the children were, let's see, the oldest

17:09.717 --> 17:15.003
was? Helen. Ellen.

17:19.008 --> 17:20.971
And she married... D.R. Patton.

17:24.316 --> 17:26.139
And they had three... Three children. Three 
children who were... Hazel. Hazel. Um... Hmm?

17:41.452 --> 17:42.754
I just gave you her name. I know, I've got it on the 
tape. There's another girl, and...

17:44.536 --> 17:50.764
And George. George.

17:56.231 --> 18:04.301
And then, let's see, the next oldest child was...

17:56.231 --> 18:04.301
Josephine. Josephine.

18:09.408 --> 18:09.788
And... Did she marry? Yes, she married a Frenchman 
by the name of Duplanques

18:12.026 --> 18:19.077
in her later years.

18:21.962 --> 18:22.603
No children. No children. She became a furrier 
here in El Paso. She has a galvan fur shop from which

18:27.971 --> 18:32.478
she retired about four years ago. Economically, 
very well to do. And then the next child was? Oscar.

18:46.882 --> 18:52.767
He married

18:46.882 --> 18:52.767
and had two children. Oscar Jr., who's a lawyer.

18:59.393 --> 19:01.015
Where does Oscar Jr. live? Here in El Paso. And he's 
married? Married. And Alfred Lee, who's a

19:04.998 --> 19:09.222
Catholic priest.

19:14.939 --> 19:16.001
What did Oscar do? Lawyer. He's a lawyer in the 
United States government.

19:23.652 --> 19:25.234
And then after Oscar was? Raymond. Raymond.

19:30.442 --> 19:40.697
He's the one that went to California and worked 
himself to a very executive position with a

19:30.442 --> 19:40.697
telephone company. And his children? No 
children. No children. Married, but no children.

19:44.926 --> 19:46.388
And the next child was? Frank. Got you. And your 
wife's from Brazil. And do you have any children?

19:50.954 --> 19:52.897
No children. We raised Oscar and Albert Lee. I 
mean, helped him financially. OK. Then this is

20:00.808 --> 20:03.051
Frank then. Robert, the judge.

20:11.302 --> 20:12.583
He's married and has two children. You raised 
Oscar and Albert. Yeah. You see, Oscar passed

20:15.606 --> 20:18.649
away. Oh, I see. He died young. He died. They became 
orphans. Mm-hmm. His wife died, too. No, his wife

20:25.757 --> 20:27.258
is alive. Oh, but you helped raise him. Okay, then 
Robert is a lawyer. Judge of the county court at law

20:32.744 --> 20:35.406
number one. And he married? Emma, and they have two 
children.

20:42.385 --> 20:44.167
And their children, what are their children? 
Robert Jr. and Victoria.

20:52.958 --> 20:56.762
And Robert is a, what does Robert do? Robert Jr. 
Students. They're students.

21:02.469 --> 21:03.610
And the next child was? Henry. Henry. Now after 
this, these were all born in the United States.

21:09.297 --> 21:09.658
Right. Henry. No, Henry, pardon me. We got Robert 
here. Who's this? That's Robert. Yeah, well,

21:16.305 --> 21:18.628
Henry should be before Robert. Okay. And Henry? 
Henry married, worked as a laborer

21:20.550 --> 21:39.573
at

21:20.550 --> 21:39.573
what's the name of that

21:20.550 --> 21:39.573
packing company? He passed away about two years 
ago. Did he have any children? He had

21:46.796 --> 22:03.085
Oscar, another Oscar, Carlos,

21:46.796 --> 22:03.085
Lawrence, Martha.

22:12.262 --> 22:13.484
They're all students. They're all students. Are 
they high school? University levels. All

22:17.249 --> 22:18.311
university students. Except one, the little girl 
Martha, she's going to high school. What does his

22:24.780 --> 22:27.203
wife do? She's a widow. He died.

22:31.790 --> 22:34.875
How is she affording to send these children 
through university?

22:37.699 --> 22:37.999
I see. And then... Were there any other children? 
Julie. Julie? Julia May. She was born here in the

22:47.849 --> 22:51.313
States. She got married, divorced. She's a school 
teacher. She went to Denton School for Girls. And

23:02.966 --> 23:04.348
she's teaching here in El Paso. Right.

23:07.852 --> 23:10.855
And of course, after that, we had...

23:14.058 --> 23:15.680
Lawrence, did I say Lawrence? He passed away when 
he was a kid going to school.

23:25.570 --> 23:29.034
I guess that's all. I like to, we've talked about 
these people and by writing them down I can

23:31.216 --> 23:36.282
remember who it was. Well, I'm going to have to meet 
my husband in a little while. He'll wonder where I

23:40.486 --> 23:42.208
am.
