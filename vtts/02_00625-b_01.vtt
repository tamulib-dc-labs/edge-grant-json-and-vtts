00:01.972 --> 00:11.882
I

00:01.972 --> 00:11.882
think you have to separate the two. I think there's 
a life at sea for the people who enjoy getting away,

00:12.402 --> 00:24.254
who enjoy discovering these things as they come 
about, and there's certainly the role for people

00:12.402 --> 00:24.254
who don't have time for this. And I have no 
objection to to modelers that haven't been at sea,

00:27.537 --> 00:34.904
provided they have done their homework and they 
know what is known about the ocean in the

00:27.537 --> 00:34.904
literature. And I think this will continue. 
There's a lot more work that has to be done at sea,

00:38.467 --> 00:47.456
and there's a particular type of individual that 
enjoys doing this and prefers to do it above other

00:38.467 --> 00:47.456
things. And I think that the modeler, it certainly 
does him good to be exposed to it because he becomes

00:56.748 --> 01:19.376
a little more tolerant as to why there isn't the 
extensive database he needs, or when he says, I

00:56.748 --> 01:19.376
would like a set of observations across the 
Pacific at 10-mile intervals that he knows

00:56.748 --> 01:19.376
exactly the manpower and the cost and the 
difficulty that it does take to get it, and perhaps

00:56.748 --> 01:19.376
even the possibility of getting it in the time 
frame that he wants. But I think that... As I say, if

01:22.769 --> 01:31.283
a person has done his homework and he is aware of the 
difficulties of getting things done at sea, I

01:22.769 --> 01:31.283
don't think that this has to be a requirement. I 
hesitated at your question because I know people

01:32.765 --> 01:37.052
feel that way. When have you been to sea last? When 
have you done this or that? And I think this only

01:40.297 --> 01:43.883
comes from...

01:45.280 --> 01:48.186
The people who are going to see, they really don't 
want to go to see. And hopefully, most of the ones

01:48.206 --> 01:55.159
that are out there are out there for their own 
curiosity and getting something for their own

01:48.206 --> 01:55.159
sake. So I hope I wishy-washy-ed my way out of that. 
But that's a very definite opinion. I think as long

02:00.269 --> 02:06.040
as the modeler is not working in the wilderness, 
And of course, that's the task of someone who goes

02:06.779 --> 02:12.729
to sea, to be able to explain and describe and 
report his results. I don't see why the other

02:12.809 --> 02:17.416
person can't read them without having to be 
sitting on deck while he does it. That's all I can

02:18.979 --> 02:21.483
probably say about that. OK.

02:21.503 --> 02:33.883
Obviously, the computer, of course, in terms of 
just data classification, data collection, and

02:21.503 --> 02:33.883
data availability, the computer has done just 
wonders for oceanography. Yet you hear an almost

02:35.298 --> 02:41.566
constant complaint somehow the younger 
oceanographers don't have enough math. Somehow

02:41.607 --> 02:44.731
that their weaknesses in mathematics and... So a 
comment as a potential employer. What do you think

02:49.217 --> 02:58.870
is a major weakness that most young 
oceanographers who come to work in and around you

02:49.217 --> 02:58.870
have? Well of course you'll get a better answer as 
to how prepared they are from the... faculty

03:04.880 --> 03:06.822
members at the university. I certainly would say 
that the professors we had aren't as tough or don't

03:07.102 --> 03:19.196
seem to be turning out the thoroughness in 
individuals that we went through. I think when we

03:19.236 --> 03:34.212
get together and talk and listen to some of the 
seminars or to talk to the people that are coming

03:19.236 --> 03:34.212
out looking for jobs and finding out what they're 
prepared to do, that there seems to be a little

03:19.236 --> 03:34.212
slippage here. But

03:34.411 --> 03:46.781
other than that, there's a whole spectrum of 
ability in any student at any level. And I wouldn't

03:47.322 --> 04:02.375
say that it's

03:47.322 --> 04:02.375
a criticism or even a commonplace attribute that 
students don't have the math that is necessary,

03:47.322 --> 04:02.375
because one wonders what is it that one needs. It 
appears today that you know, that you not only need

04:06.372 --> 04:19.089
a complete series of vector equations, but 
statistics and computers, computer graphics.

04:20.370 --> 04:26.238
There's just so much more to learn and to know than 
we had, say, even 10 or 20 years ago. I don't know how

04:26.258 --> 04:29.622
they find all the time to put it in. There's no limit 
to the proficiency that one should have in

04:31.212 --> 04:35.598
statistics today, and yet that's only one phase. 
That's sort of a number crunching attitude. And

04:37.881 --> 04:50.177
when you get into

04:37.881 --> 04:50.177
differential equations, there's no limit to how 
much time you want to spend on becoming proficient

04:37.881 --> 04:50.177
in differential equations. So I find it very 
difficult to answer that question. There's no

04:57.107 --> 04:58.789
limit to the proficiency that you would like in all 
phases of mathematics because of the nature of the

04:59.528 --> 05:11.299
interruption in time and space and data, the time 
series aspects of data. And I don't see this

05:11.700 --> 05:14.062
lacking. I think that

05:14.082 --> 05:26.694
the papers that are evident in the literature show 
a certainly inadequate mathematical background

05:14.082 --> 05:26.694
in their analysis, for my mind. As a prospective 
employer, Is there anything you would like to

05:29.161 --> 05:32.507
advise students to do?

05:42.166 --> 05:48.859
Well,

05:42.166 --> 05:48.859
I don't know. I remember when Dr. Fleming. with 
that hydrographic office. He used to tell the

05:52.805 --> 05:55.751
people that came to him, put all your books away. 
What I need and what you're going to get into isn't

05:56.392 --> 05:59.218
in books. We're going to have to find it out 
together. And I think we've advanced beyond that.

06:04.127 --> 06:10.660
I think there are very definite techniques, even 
in biology, geology, or chemistry, that you need

06:10.876 --> 06:39.955
and these are mathematical techniques and so if I 
was encouraging anybody in the ocean I would tell

06:10.876 --> 06:39.955
them to forget the skin diving aspects or the round 
the world trips or what have you and to concentrate

06:10.876 --> 06:39.955
and then have a good background in mathematics 
because whatever level that they either end up at

06:10.876 --> 06:39.955
or are limited by they will make good use of in the 
study of the ocean I think one thing that people

06:40.289 --> 06:52.046
aren't prepared for, or

06:40.289 --> 06:52.046
don't seem to be prepared for, is the tedious 
proposal writing. I think most students that come

06:52.066 --> 07:02.280
out have been sheltered by major professors who 
have gone to the trouble to get grants, and they go

06:52.066 --> 07:02.280
out and work, and their initial task is requires 
them to jump in and go to work, that's fine. But very

07:06.265 --> 07:12.033
quickly, they will have to come up with a proposal, 
whether it's government or whether they're

07:06.265 --> 07:12.033
working on a grant. And they will have to explain 
what it is that they want to do and why. And this is

07:15.758 --> 07:17.360
time consuming. And a lot of people object to this. 
And very few people are trained in it. And yet, it's

07:22.367 --> 07:28.015
one of the facts of life that most people come right 
into head on. To be frank, some of them do very

07:28.687 --> 07:30.749
poorly. We talked about mathematics. Some of them 
really can't state what it is and why it is that he

07:32.992 --> 07:42.904
wants to do it and what it is that he wants to do and 
why it is significant. And you find that you have to

07:42.924 --> 07:47.229
restructure some of the things that they do. So 
it's just like any other decade or century that a

07:47.510 --> 07:58.423
good, solid classical scholastic background is 
needed still. This exotic science, if you want to

07:58.893 --> 08:01.716
call it exotic.

08:04.780 --> 08:05.981
What else are you going to? That's all I really can 
say on that. Okay. That, again, is enough. Now,

08:11.247 --> 08:14.531
obviously, you're training oceanography, 
meteorology, marine biology. It's a very broad

08:14.551 --> 08:16.253
education. Yeah. Is that one of your suggestions, 
is that those people receiving an education

08:17.414 --> 08:24.242
receive one this broadly construed? Well, I'm 
changing my mind on that. One of the people that had

08:28.140 --> 08:33.326
the greatest impact on my career was Dr. Fleming. 
And of course, his courses at the university were

08:33.747 --> 08:40.274
to give people a broad background rather than a 
specific one. But a lot of his staff felt that the

08:41.175 --> 08:45.761
specific one really was more important than the 
broad one. So there was no conflict there, but less

08:45.801 --> 08:49.285
the difference of opinion. He used to call himself 
the last general oceanographer. Well, there are

08:53.141 --> 09:00.429
many times that I felt that I inherited that term, 
that I may be the last general oceanographer. And

09:02.412 --> 09:05.175
in some cases, I thought that might be limiting. 
But I find that the people that are specializing

09:05.435 --> 09:12.083
are not are staying with their specialty to the 
point where they're almost wringing themselves

09:13.987 --> 09:18.774
dry. And yet by being in this specialty, they 
really don't have the confidence and in many cases

09:19.115 --> 09:38.965
the ability to become a program head or to become in 
the supervisory capacity where he has to address

09:19.115 --> 09:38.965
the many facets and the applications and the 
usefulness of oceanography.

09:39.468 --> 09:47.656
So I have gone in and out of this, the sense that I 
must specialize in the one that generalization is

09:39.468 --> 09:47.656
fine, but it's a very weak spot. And I'm finally 
coming back to the point that most of the people

09:47.716 --> 09:58.467
that are leading and guiding oceanography today 
are more the generalists than the specialists. So

09:58.487 --> 10:00.549
I don't object to that term anymore. In the sense of 
Dr. Fleming, Wayne Burritt, although the

10:00.609 --> 10:05.914
physical type is really guided oceanography at 
Oregon State. Most of his work has been of a general

10:09.659 --> 10:15.907
nature rather than a specific rigorous 
mathematical approach. And you can go right on

10:16.708 --> 10:18.370
down the line. I even think Stommel is becoming a 
generalist, although he would probably deny it.

10:26.940 --> 10:33.488
He still has a very unique and a very deep interest 
in physical oceanography, but I think In fact, he

10:33.839 --> 10:43.550
said in his book that oceanography requires the 
broad at-sea approach and an understanding of

10:33.839 --> 10:43.550
interactions. So I would have to leave that 
question in that way. Any regrets?

10:55.704 --> 11:00.430
Well, they're not regrets as much as if they are 
sort of incompletions. I would have liked to have

11:03.944 --> 11:12.401
whetted the appetite of the biologists and the 
fishery service to become more interested and

11:03.944 --> 11:12.401
involved in environmental studies. There's a 
good sign that it's coming along now, but it sure

11:13.443 --> 11:22.982
didn't come along as quickly as I wanted in the 
sense that they will.

11:24.683 --> 11:28.609
ask for assistance now, and in many cases are 
making their own observations. Whereas when I

11:28.709 --> 11:48.177
first came here, we literally had to fight for a 
time at sea, even on a fishing boat, to ask for 24

11:28.709 --> 11:48.177
hours in a two- or three-month cruise so that you 
could get a sort of a sampling of just forage

11:28.709 --> 11:48.177
organisms to try and assess the food of salmon was 
considered not not in the cards, that they just had

11:49.439 --> 11:53.005
to get on to their next fishing station. And I think 
we're seeing that, like everyone else, I think the

11:53.105 --> 12:09.873
meteorologists felt at one time in the early 1900s 
that they could predict better weather if they had

11:53.105 --> 12:09.873
more reporting stations, and they finally got 
reporting stations all over the country, and

11:53.105 --> 12:09.873
today they're saying they still can't forecast. I 
think the fishery biologist felt that what he

12:09.893 --> 12:13.860
needed was We're more fishing data and that if he 
did that he could solve his problem and I think

12:14.735 --> 12:41.130
we're getting to the point now where the ships are 
collecting huge amounts of data and the

12:14.735 --> 12:41.130
variability that is environmentally related is 
becoming sharper and sharper rather than more

12:14.735 --> 12:41.130
vague and they're beginning to realize that 
they're going to have to address this question of

12:14.735 --> 12:41.130
the environment really changing the 
distribution and abundance of organisms. And so

12:42.005 --> 12:44.508
there's nothing new in the sun there. It's just 
time. And other than that, no. We've had a very

12:49.255 --> 12:52.059
interesting phase. We've worked in an 
international commission. We're involved in

12:54.282 --> 13:00.029
numerous interdisciplinary programs. And 
that's been our approach, to try and get a team of

13:00.410 --> 13:05.817
people here. And I have always had a team. I have 
never expanded into the physical group. We have

13:11.844 --> 13:16.232
always had biologists on our team, 
planktologists. At one time, we had covered all of

13:16.272 --> 13:21.982
the fields of oceanography. When we had the data 
buoys, we had an electronic technician to handle

13:22.042 --> 13:28.073
our equipment, which is nothing today. But in 
those days, he was quite unique. and a person in

13:30.622 --> 13:37.792
primary production, secondary production in 
descriptive oceanography, theoretical

13:30.622 --> 13:37.792
oceanography, and in marine chemistry. And we had 
this group, and

13:37.992 --> 13:47.225
it should have been expanded two or three times to 
be a totally effective group. And instead of that,

13:47.366 --> 13:55.397
we were whittled down and had to fight our way like 
anybody else does through the budgeting system

13:47.366 --> 13:55.397
and what have you. But I think that this is it. The 
universities claim, well, we have all these

13:57.819 --> 14:00.562
departments. Therefore, we do integrated 
studies. I don't think that's true. I think you

14:03.606 --> 14:06.469
have to get these people at sea, work together. And 
I think this is generally Dr. Fleming's

14:07.230 --> 14:12.056
philosophy 20, 25 years ago. And I've tried to make 
it work here. And I think I've shown that it would

14:14.740 --> 14:17.843
work. I think I've shown that when you do permit 
people to do this, you get very interesting

14:18.044 --> 14:23.190
results. But I wouldn't say that it's caught on in 
many places. So those are the only two regrets,

14:30.164 --> 14:35.232
that we didn't get a commensurate group. What you 
want to remember is that NOAA has made up of very

14:35.512 --> 14:46.050
roughly 300 fishery biologists, about 6,000 to 
7,000 meteorologists, and probably 100 bona fide

14:35.512 --> 14:46.050
oceanographers. And so what we're trying to do is 
Fisheries people realize that they're working in

14:49.664 --> 14:55.309
the ocean, but they have other requirements for 
their money. The meteorologists realize the

14:55.349 --> 15:01.035
ocean changes the atmosphere, but they've been 
plotting weather maps for years. They don't want

15:01.095 --> 15:01.796
it. And I would hope that the three stand as a triad, 
and they all. That would be my wish for

15:11.025 --> 15:18.692
oceanography, is that there is a coordinated 
group that puts the pieces together. I don't

15:20.381 --> 15:24.685
object to the universities studying anything 
they want at any time and any place. But to just put

15:25.066 --> 15:33.133
it together and let it rest there for 10 or 15 years 
because there's nobody that is working on the

15:25.066 --> 15:33.133
puzzle that that's a piece of is a crime. And I would 
like to see something in the order of 2,000 or 3,000

15:34.154 --> 15:37.957
oceanographers. And I think that the country 
would be amazed at what is going on in the ocean and

15:38.017 --> 15:48.527
how it does apply to their livelihood and their 
climate. So if that was a wish, then that's what I

15:49.503 --> 15:52.006
would like. In fact, I wrote when Bob White came 
into the system. We were in interior and joined

15:55.650 --> 15:59.455
ESSA, which became NOAA. I told him, you know, take 
care of your oceanographers. But he certainly was

16:03.800 --> 16:09.847
unable to do very much in that area. So I have no 
complaints. That's what I would wish would

16:13.251 --> 16:15.153
happen. Is there anything you'd like to add to the 
tape? Any comments you'd like to make? Which

16:19.743 --> 16:20.704
questions missed?

16:24.209 --> 16:34.221
No, I think that one thing that I would like to see 
more of that I don't think really you touched on,

16:24.209 --> 16:34.221
and that is international cooperation. And we 
touched on it just with the Japanese, not with

16:36.204 --> 16:42.171
other groups. Don Hood at the University of Alaska 
has done just great work in trying to get the Soviet

16:49.122 --> 16:54.730
Union, Canada, Japan, and Korea are interested in 
studies in the Bering Sea. And he's had some

16:54.750 --> 16:57.173
success at this. And I find this rather lacking in 
other areas. There's a lot of one-on-one. You have

17:04.623 --> 17:09.830
a friend that is in Japan, and you write a project 
together, and you study it. I'm talking about

17:09.890 --> 17:16.699
large-scale, multidisciplinary, integrated 
investigations by countries. that have a finite

17:17.405 --> 17:22.693
time period and a specific objective. I would like 
to see more of this. We had some of it in the INPFC. We

17:29.483 --> 17:31.506
get a lot of it here at the center. The Soviets will 
come through, they're fishing Hague, and they

17:31.566 --> 17:38.856
begin to realize that Hague fluctuates quite a 
bit. And just a few months ago we gave an extensive

17:38.876 --> 17:45.606
talk on the environment of the Hague. We haven't 
discussed the environment in the INPF of salmon.

17:50.517 --> 17:54.422
We're dealing with the environment of pollock and 
ground fish along the coast. And I think that the

17:54.663 --> 18:02.955
fisheries group deal with this, but they don't 
deal with it. They deal with it at the level of

18:04.217 --> 18:10.666
fishery oceanographers, someone that's used to 
correlating temperature with fish or something

18:04.217 --> 18:10.666
like that. We don't really deal here with the 
oceanographers who have studied it as a system and

18:10.686 --> 18:15.593
how it changes. And this is what Don Hood has done. 
Now, I don't see very much of this all the way down

18:18.225 --> 18:23.552
the coast here on that scale. I wouldn't take away 
the fact that they are aware of foreign scientists

18:24.313 --> 18:29.840
and they travel back and forth. But I don't 
consider IDOE in this category and some of the

18:31.682 --> 18:36.849
other programs. But if there was one person I think 
that has taken an approach that I think is

18:37.830 --> 18:44.639
necessary, it's that. Because I think What we are 
going to need and will get, certainly, in five or 10

18:46.690 --> 18:57.207
years is sort of a Pacific commission, sort of 
something like the ICs in the Atlantic. In fact, we

18:57.267 --> 19:00.933
jokingly call it Pisces, which, of course, is 
fish, you see. But we're going to have to know what

19:00.953 --> 19:11.871
is going on in the ocean, why it goes on, what effect 
it has on the biota, and how the biota interacts.

19:13.049 --> 19:20.398
When the Albert Corps come up to the salmon front, 
or they eat the salmon, or the salmon run away, and

19:13.049 --> 19:20.398
what is the front that they will or will not go 
beyond? And if they do this, what happens to the

19:20.438 --> 19:22.601
seals? And what happens to everything else? This 
whole system has to be really laid out. And it can

19:27.647 --> 19:32.373
only be done by some kind of an international 
Pacific commission. And that's all I tried to do

19:33.174 --> 19:36.939
here on a very, very small scale. And I think it will 
come. I think it's necessary. But it will. It will

19:42.631 --> 19:47.442
take a lot of planning, and hopefully it won't get 
bogged down in administration. But I guess that's

19:49.306 --> 19:53.576
another wish for the future that I would like to 
see. So other than that, nothing.
