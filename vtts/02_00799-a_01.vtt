00:02.022 --> 00:06.748
Testing, this is an interview with Dr. John 
Milleth. Today's date is Wednesday, March 5th,

00:08.491 --> 00:14.239
1980. This is the second interview with Dr. 
Milleth concerning the School of Veterinary

00:15.380 --> 00:22.269
Medicine. This is Terry Anderson.

00:35.738 --> 00:48.470
This is our second interview with Dr. John Miloff 
on Wednesday, March 5, 1980, and the last time we

00:35.738 --> 00:48.470
were discussing the years of the 1920s and the 
1930s at Texas A&M. This time I'd like to bring it up

00:48.910 --> 00:51.192
to date. In 1936 you were appointed instructor, 
and then in 1938 you were appointed assistant

00:51.953 --> 01:02.843
professors in the Department of Pathology. Could 
you tell me what courses you taught? And what was

01:05.422 --> 01:07.364
the teaching load back then? Well, I couldn't tell 
you without looking in the catalog. But I was the

01:13.210 --> 01:17.774
only one in veterinary pathology. And we had a 
general pathology course and a special pathology

01:19.055 --> 01:26.342
course.

01:29.666 --> 01:35.091
And as I recall, there was a graduate course but in 
those days it was not taught very often. Most of the

01:40.102 --> 01:48.515
teaching back in those days was just for 
veterinary students and they didn't go on for

01:40.102 --> 01:48.515
graduate work very often. So in the main it 
consisted of general and special path. That was

01:58.050 --> 01:59.112
it. You remember the first time you gave a lecture 
Yes. Could you relate that? I remember it very

02:03.860 --> 02:09.588
distinctly, but this was not in veterinary 
medicine. It was over in biology. Oh, really? Yes,

02:12.452 --> 02:19.803
because I had been a graduate assistant two years 
in biology in 1932.

02:22.727 --> 02:29.277
When I had my first class, it was in the anatomy and 
physiology for... physical ed students and

02:30.725 --> 02:35.831
pre-med students. And as I told you the other day, 
Dr. Kelsey in Houston and Bones Irvin, who was in

02:35.851 --> 02:49.365
our athletic department for quite a few years, 
were students. Same way with Dr. Mac Fattridge. So

02:53.350 --> 02:57.154
I had several men there who later became MDs and 
rather prominent people. So, luckily, the first

03:02.657 --> 03:14.350
lecture, the first hour of class was only 30 
minutes in those days. It was only 30 minutes? A

03:15.711 --> 03:16.832
lecture was 30 minutes? The first hour. Oh, in the 
morning. The first hour in the morning? No. The

03:21.157 --> 03:23.520
first time the class met. Oh. You met for 30 
minutes, just to more or less to find out about your

03:28.606 --> 03:36.443
students and see that their cards were there, and 
to assign a lesson, to name the textbook. It's more

03:36.944 --> 03:39.369
of an introductory period. And from then on, it was 
50 minutes? From then on, it was a 50-minute

03:43.377 --> 03:47.526
period.

03:49.075 --> 03:57.167
Luckily, it was only 30 minutes because my mouth 
became so dry I could hardly

03:49.075 --> 03:57.167
speak. My first class at Texas A&M. I had, I think it 
was eight students in that group. It was a 300

04:05.620 --> 04:07.422
course. And it was all my course at $45 a month. But 
they didn't give you the introduction, the survey

04:14.232 --> 04:17.277
course? The lower level course? They gave you an 
upper level course the first time? No, I had 341,

04:23.145 --> 04:25.587
342 biology. Four hour course, physiology and 
anatomy. So it was all mine. I borrowed and bought a

04:33.395 --> 04:36.778
few things. Dr. Ball gave me enough money to buy 
some histology slides. I borrowed skeleton,

04:41.143 --> 04:48.310
human skeleton bones from Galveston Medical 
School. Just here, yonder, and elsewhere.

04:51.716 --> 05:02.291
Physiology, but near physiology alone, a few 
smoke drums, a few drum chemographs to smoke.

05:02.311 --> 05:03.173
That's all we had. We went frog gigging at night, 
caught frogs for nerve muscle preparations.

05:12.165 --> 05:14.128
We had a good time. The students, well, Bones 
Irving said, John, that's the best course I ever

05:15.593 --> 05:22.580
had in my life. In general, you thought you were 
pretty nervous? I was. My first class, I was rather

05:25.684 --> 05:31.810
nervous, naturally.

05:39.258 --> 05:41.800
Now, all this was before World War II. Do you 
remember what you were doing on December 7, 1941?

05:46.492 --> 05:47.293
Pearl Harbor. I can remember at noon on December 
7th, we were having, Ruth and I were having lunch at

05:48.834 --> 05:58.462
Miss Maggie Parker's in Bryan. With old Judge Nunn 
from Crockett and Mrs. Bernice Claytor, who was in

06:00.404 --> 06:09.412
the extension service at A&M. And the news came 
over the radio that Pearl Harbor had been bombed. I

06:18.065 --> 06:19.788
remember that very well. What was your reaction?

06:25.977 --> 06:41.901
Well, my reaction was one of utter dismay because 
we were told that the Pacific Fleet had been wiped

06:25.977 --> 06:41.901
out and we didn't know what was to happen next.

06:41.921 --> 06:43.043
How about your colleagues?

06:45.655 --> 06:53.506
Well, they had the same reaction, but it wasn't 
long before we settled down. We registered and so

06:53.786 --> 06:55.388
on. I had to register for the draft, but I was 
classified 4F because I had had tuberculosis and

06:55.468 --> 07:08.326
so on. So I managed to stay on at A&M and teach. Well, 
we had ASTP students. They were in the armed

07:17.770 --> 07:19.973
forces, actually. And to begin with, then, Dr. 
Rubin had a commission

07:21.154 --> 07:30.743
in the armed services. So he had to leave. And I was 
left alone. And from then on, I don't know how many

07:34.247 --> 07:43.777
veterinary graduates we hired during World War 
II. I thought it was a pity. since we were teaching

07:45.815 --> 07:56.027
students who were in the armed services, why the 
faculty was not put in armed services too. Because

07:57.068 --> 08:05.217
we were kept busy trying to find someone to teach on 
account of the fact that every time we got someone,

07:57.068 --> 08:05.217
they were drafted. So it kept us in a turmoil all the 
time. During the war, we were. In other words, you

08:13.437 --> 08:17.622
wanted to have a commission then? Yes, I'd like to 
have had a commission and to have been assigned to

08:17.642 --> 08:22.748
teach. Oh, I see. And I think if we ever get into 
another conflict, that's what they should do. I

08:29.456 --> 08:38.367
can't see any reason why you have to keep searching 
for someone to teach students who are in the

08:29.456 --> 08:38.367
services. Because in the service, if they're 
teaching, they're certainly in uniform. And

08:45.991 --> 08:47.573
there was another thing, too. Our faculty members 
were young people where they just graduated, more

08:47.853 --> 09:07.864
than likely, and came right back into teaching 
just as a gap between then and going into the

08:47.853 --> 09:07.864
service, because they knew they were going to be 
drafted.

09:08.333 --> 09:10.296
They were in civilian clothes. And here in Bryan, 
we had Bryan Air Force Base. And on weekdays or

09:16.688 --> 09:24.561
weekends, the streets of Bryan were just filled 
with men in uniform. And what do you think? Here's a

09:26.525 --> 09:28.428
youngster goes down there. He's maybe 21, 22 years 
old. And he's in civilian clothes. Yeah, what are

09:34.507 --> 09:37.491
you doing in civilian clothes? Why aren't you in 
uniform? Well, it was embarrassing to them. I've

09:43.179 --> 09:45.042
had that related to me. You had it related while you 
were here? Yeah. Could you give me an example? The

09:51.131 --> 09:58.101
youngsters who went to town and were criticized 
for not being in uniform. I've had them tell me that

09:58.121 --> 10:03.889
they just didn't want to go to town, on Saturdays 
especially. when the streets would be jammed with

10:04.578 --> 10:09.385
men in from Bryan Air Force Base. So I think if we 
ever get into another conflict, why, if we're

10:10.587 --> 10:26.531
going to continue our college courses within, 
staff members who are teaching should be in

10:10.587 --> 10:26.531
uniform. That's the only thing to do. That's an 
interesting point. Now. We had. The speed-up

10:34.362 --> 10:37.546
program, as they called it in those days. What did 
that stand for? You taught every course every

10:38.287 --> 10:42.914
semester. Now, if you can, you just try to do that 
and try to keep faculty, too. Yeah. Every course,

10:52.587 --> 10:54.169
every semester.

10:56.892 --> 10:58.835
So that's a choice. That went on for three years. 
Every course, every semester. And so are there any

11:04.518 --> 11:14.513
other ways in which, besides the speed up, are 
there other ways in which the war affected the

11:04.518 --> 11:14.513
school of medicine, do you think? Well, we had 
trouble getting formaldehyde for embalming, and

11:14.733 --> 11:24.067
we had trouble in obtaining alcohol. We had 
trouble in obtaining almost anything.

11:28.373 --> 11:31.858
Sometimes, well, I can recall that we paid as high 
as, $15 a gallon for formaldehyde for embalming

11:32.227 --> 11:37.795
animals. $15

11:37.815 --> 11:41.660
a gallon. Of course, I don't know what it sells for 
now, but that was a tremendous price to pay for it.

11:48.670 --> 11:53.237
What did it cost normally? I don't recall now, but 
it was much cheaper than that old $1.02 a gallon,

11:53.257 --> 12:00.968
something like that. compared to that $15. But 
there were people who would like to do a little

12:03.179 --> 12:11.091
black marketing. Oh, really? Oh, yeah. Do you know 
of any examples? Well, I'm not going to quote any

12:14.636 --> 12:21.886
names, but I know one person who would like to have 
sold me more formaldehyde. He had it, but he wanted

12:21.926 --> 12:26.412
an exorbitant price for it. But I told him we'd just 
do without. But in general, did you find much black

12:31.340 --> 12:37.307
marketing during that time? No, I didn't. We had 
trouble getting alcohol. Our alcohol, I don't

12:43.034 --> 12:50.684
know whether it still does or not, but in those 
days, it came from the state chemist, old Dr.

12:43.034 --> 12:50.684
Fraps. Pardon me for the old. But Dr. Fraps was head 
of the state chemistry lab then, and he was very

13:00.989 --> 13:12.507
reluctant to give up the alcohol unless you had a 
real need for it. And he put you through an

13:12.527 --> 13:15.011
inquisition. If you went over there for a gallon or 
two of alcohol, he asked you 1,001 questions. Mean

13:22.944 --> 13:23.304
it? It was like an inquisition. Oh, really? I can 
remember one person who was over in biology, went

13:28.580 --> 13:33.427
there for alcohol. Dr. Frapps began with that 
inquisition with him. Well, this person didn't

13:39.156 --> 13:46.907
relish the idea of being interrogated so 
intensely. So when Dr. Frapps asked him, what are

13:47.187 --> 13:51.974
you going to do with this alcohol? He said, well, 
Dr. Frapps, I'm going to take you down on the Brazos

13:54.871 --> 13:58.676
River and get drunker than hell. Don't you want to 
go along with me? They had him up on the carpet. He

14:09.330 --> 14:13.696
had to visit the president's office. And he was 
dressed down for being so insubordinate. That

14:20.225 --> 14:22.448
type of a martyr. And there was another one who went 
over there. He said, Dr. Fraps, I have heard quite a

14:27.116 --> 14:36.489
bit about you on this campus. You old SOB. I don't 
intend to sit here and undergo this

14:39.614 --> 14:44.000
interrogation. Now, if you're going to give me the 
alcohol, let's have it. If not, I'll be on my way.

14:50.068 --> 14:52.992
Well, they had him up on the carpet, too. And 
rightly so, he had no reason to say anything like

14:54.423 --> 15:02.532
that to Dr. Frapps. Well, he learned a few things 
from Dr. Frapps. I went over there one time with

15:05.796 --> 15:08.860
some glass bottles. So at the end of the 
interrogation, he asked me if I brought

15:10.161 --> 15:17.189
containers for the alcohol. I said, yes, I have 
some jugs. He said, are they crock? I said, no,

15:22.755 --> 15:24.177
they're glass. He said, well, they're not jugs. 
They're bottles. Jugs are made of crock. Thank you

15:34.823 --> 15:38.126
very much, Dr. Frank.

15:40.829 --> 15:42.090
And then you went upstairs. Old Dr. Asbury, 
another one of the old timers on the campus, had

15:42.431 --> 15:52.341
quite a character.

15:53.907 --> 15:58.613
You had to take the requisition up to him to get the 
alcohol. So he measured it. He measured it to the

16:02.097 --> 16:05.120
cc. He had a 1,000 cc graduate cylinder. And he 
poured the alcohol out of five gallon tins into

16:10.767 --> 16:19.037
this graduate cylinder. He was rather nervous, so 
he would spill quite a bit on the floor. Well, the

16:24.878 --> 16:32.969
boss says we have to measure it to the CC, and he's 
just sloshing it over. He's spilling about as much

16:32.989 --> 16:37.274
as outside the cylinder is in it. But he was another 
character. Were there other changes besides the

16:42.781 --> 16:48.568
shortage of supply that you noticed during the 
war?

16:51.215 --> 16:53.377
No, I don't recall. I know we worked hard. What 
about the number of students? We didn't have too

16:56.780 --> 16:59.743
many students. The student groups fell off quite a 
bit. But prior to the war, we had gotten up to a

17:07.109 --> 17:16.597
goodly number of students. I don't know how many we 
had. I'd have to go back and look at my old class roll

17:19.919 --> 17:28.047
books to find out exactly the number. I guess those 
old roll books are still in the anatomy

17:29.008 --> 17:32.772
department. I left them there. They were supposed 
to be part of the property of the college.

17:41.921 --> 17:46.365
In those days, we had quite an influx of students 
from New York. Why is that? They could go to school

17:48.713 --> 17:52.978
cheaper in Texas than they could up there. And 
Cornell evidently didn't want too many of them.

17:59.146 --> 18:05.653
They required the student to have a year on the 
farm. I don't know what else they required, but

18:06.695 --> 18:17.027
that kept most of them out because they were from 
Long Island and Hoboken. what have you, around New

18:17.345 --> 18:20.370
York City, the Bronx. So we had a big influx of those 
fellows for several years. Finally, the board of

18:30.466 --> 18:40.942
directors ruled that we couldn't take any 
out-of-state students except nine students from

18:30.466 --> 18:40.942
Louisiana. And that's all. When was that about? 
When did that change come about? Oh, I don't

18:45.239 --> 18:52.065
recall, but it was way back in there in the 40s. So I 
don't recall what year it was. Speaking of the 40s,

18:57.049 --> 19:06.297
right after the war, there was this university, 
and many universities in this country have

18:57.049 --> 19:06.297
experienced a great period of growth. Well, 
that's when our growth began. Yeah. Let's talk

19:09.940 --> 19:11.101
about that. What do you think were the most 
important changes?

19:18.466 --> 19:26.178
Well, I think that the most important changes came 
about in our curriculum. We began to look at our

19:27.700 --> 19:31.647
curriculum more closely. Well, I would say that 
from the late 30s on, our curriculum improved and

19:32.568 --> 19:41.682
our teaching improved. In fact, I think that along 
about

19:48.048 --> 19:50.551
19 and 38, probably. From then till now, we've been 
on a gradual improvement. Why do you say that? Why

19:58.302 --> 20:00.866
would you pick out that period? Well, there was a 
period in there from, I would say, the middle 20s on

20:00.886 --> 20:17.228
up to about 38,

20:00.886 --> 20:17.228
wherein the College of Veterinary Medicine 
deteriorated. And as I can look back and see it, we

20:19.132 --> 20:26.581
almost closed up.

20:30.325 --> 20:38.235
In fact, when I started teaching in veterinary 
medicine in 36, it was deplorable. We had nothing.

20:40.217 --> 20:41.278
Supplies. No supplies. Nothing built up in a... In 
a department where you're supposed to have a

20:46.638 --> 21:14.369
beautiful slide library for histology and 
embryology, or in pathology where you're

20:46.638 --> 21:14.369
supposed to have, oh, examples of nearly all the 
diseases and pathologic conditions in animals,

20:46.638 --> 21:14.369
what do you have? Nothing. everything is rack and 
ruin the old slides well when i went into pathology

21:16.490 --> 21:44.505
in 36 there were a few old things there slides of 
conditions diseases that dr francis and dr

21:16.490 --> 21:44.505
marsteller had brought from ohio state with them 
things that they had picked up along the way well

21:16.490 --> 21:44.505
the stains had deteriorated They were cut too 
thick. They were improperly prepared, and so on.

21:49.505 --> 22:05.509
So all of that stuff, instead of trying to teach 
with it, which was useless, I threw it out, just

21:49.505 --> 22:05.509
threw it away, broke it up, put it in the trash, and 
started from scratch. Well, why do you say that it

22:05.529 --> 22:08.233
started to improve in about 39? Well, that's when 
we actually, the improvement was enough that you

22:14.455 --> 22:18.821
could see it by 38 or 39. To begin with, in 36 and 37, 
you were striving with everything you had, all the

22:19.802 --> 22:31.158
energy you were putting forth to building up a 
slide collection. If you wanted to show a student a

22:32.680 --> 22:39.089
section of liver, a liver cell, what did you have? A 
picture and a book. And that's about the way it was.

22:44.307 --> 23:08.475
And in pathology, in 35 or 34, when I took pathology 
under Dr. Wharton, all he did was to give each

22:44.307 --> 23:08.475
student, there were 16 students, he gave each one 
of us five slides of diseased tissue.

23:08.495 --> 23:13.200
And whenever you wrote the slides up, and turned 
them in, you had finished your course in

23:14.007 --> 23:20.295
pathology. That is the truth. So what pathology 
did we have? All you did was to turn through a

23:26.223 --> 23:42.225
pathology textbook and try to find something in 
the way of an illustration in the book that looked

23:26.223 --> 23:42.225
like what you had in this section that you were 
looking at under a little old cheap microscope, if

23:26.223 --> 23:42.225
you could find one that wasn't in use. They didn't 
have but three or four microscopes. So

23:50.008 --> 24:02.507
I would say that as far as pathology went, I had none 
when I was studying in veterinary medicine. Now

24:02.527 --> 24:03.669
this was 1934. He

24:03.789 --> 24:10.339
had no collection of material. He had enough 
material to put five slides in an envelope, and

24:11.804 --> 24:23.762
when you have decided what these are, well, write 
them up and turn it in, and I'll give you a grade on

24:11.804 --> 24:23.762
it. We had no formal lectures.

24:28.850 --> 24:33.878
We had no post-mortem material. He and Dr. Wharton 
and Dr. Marsteller were at odds. And Dr.

24:39.226 --> 24:48.240
Marsteller would see to it that nothing that died 
ever went to pathology for an autopsy. Nothing.

24:53.468 --> 25:00.138
And I can remember that we posted one old mule. And 
that's all I saw in pathology. And I don't recall

25:03.583 --> 25:06.668
now what was wrong with the old mule. He may have 
died of colic or something. I don't know. So

25:12.201 --> 25:22.576
actually, other than physiology, Dr. Burns was 
giving a good course in physiology and a good

25:12.201 --> 25:22.576
course in pharmacology and toxicology. His 
department, I don't believe, ever fell down. But

25:29.546 --> 25:34.393
the others did because Dr. Wharton taught 11 
courses all by himself. Now, if you can teach all

25:41.303 --> 26:03.807
the courses in pathology, all the courses in 
bacteriology, including immunology, milk and

25:41.303 --> 26:03.807
meat hygiene, sanitary,

25:41.303 --> 26:03.807
classes in milk and meat inspection work, if you 
can do all of that plus jurisprudence, 11 courses,

26:04.310 --> 26:18.447
I believe, altogether that have been broken down 
into three or four departments now with I don't

26:04.310 --> 26:18.447
know how many people in each department. But here 
was one man attempting to do all of that. Well, I

26:24.394 --> 26:26.977
don't think his attempt went very far. I think he 
gave up. And I believe that's the reason that he and

26:30.095 --> 26:36.187
Dr. Marsteller were at odds. Well, that and other 
things, too. The personal life of Dr. Horton was

26:39.012 --> 26:42.599
something else. When he died in San Antonio, he had 
been married nine times and divorced, I believe.

26:50.750 --> 26:52.612
But he was... Nine times? Dr. Wharton was... Nine 
times? Well, his father... How could any man

26:55.175 --> 26:58.218
handle that? His father had been married and 
divorced 11 times, so he wanted to break his

26:58.399 --> 27:05.266
father's record. So he told me. Anyhow, I was his 
graduate assistant, and very often, to show you

27:07.409 --> 27:19.542
more about the teaching in those days, he might 
come to me 10 minutes before class time and say i

27:20.298 --> 27:47.436
have to go into town would you mind taking this next 
class i said well what is it and he would say maybe uh

27:20.298 --> 27:47.436
general pathology or something i said well what 
were you going to talk about today well he said just

27:20.298 --> 27:47.436
talk about anything you want to talk about because 
i have got to go to town so Yeah, I am. I don't know

27:49.403 --> 27:53.810
what he was going to talk about, if anything. So I 
have about 10 minutes to get ready. So you know what

27:59.358 --> 28:01.441
they had. Because at that time, I had had no 
pathology to amount to anything. Yes, I had had

28:07.390 --> 28:14.360
this course that he was supposed to give to the 
students. But I don't know what he was going to do.

28:18.432 --> 28:20.255
Ten minutes before class time. Here you go. What'd 
you do? Well, you just take a book and more or less

28:22.879 --> 28:27.005
read it out to them. And that's about something. 
Why did he have to go to jail? So he would come. Well,

28:32.413 --> 28:34.156
he was having trouble. He had had a divorce. And his 
wife had been given custody of the two children.

28:42.047 --> 28:45.132
And the sheriff was on him then. He was, I think 
Wharton had the children down at his house. He had

28:49.507 --> 28:51.670
taken them down there. And the sheriff was going to 
go down there and get them. And Wharton says, well,

28:56.535 --> 29:00.580
if you do, I'll meet you at the front gate. And 
you're not going to get away alive. I'll kill you.

29:07.908 --> 29:08.749
And he would have. I believe he would have. The 
sheriff didn't show. I believe.

29:18.727 --> 29:20.649
Well, anyway, I think that. But he didn't get along 
with Marsteller. He and Dr. Moore. Well, I can see

29:23.311 --> 29:24.672
that. Dr. Marsteller didn't want to put up with a 
lot of foolishness. And the way things were going,

29:31.098 --> 29:33.941
too, in the department.

29:36.403 --> 29:38.605
Horton was a very independent person. I could talk 
to you all day about Dr. Horton. But he, Dr. Horton,

29:43.109 --> 29:47.653
actually was a brilliant person. He had a 
photographic memory. He could take a textbook or

29:52.259 --> 30:07.258
whatever you handed him and just turn page after 
page and give it back to you word for word,

29:52.259 --> 30:07.258
practically word for word. Or he would come into 
class. This was back in, oh, long, about 19 and 30,

30:09.440 --> 30:17.370
31, somewhere along. taking a course as an 
elective. Dr. Wharton would come in, roll his Bull

30:21.551 --> 30:39.371
Durham cigarette,

30:21.551 --> 30:39.371
push his big black Stetson kind of over his shaggy 
eyebrows, get his boots up on the table. There's

30:40.393 --> 30:41.494
something in there. He'd been out in the cowlots. 
You could tell he always wore cowboy boots and

30:43.216 --> 30:47.020
never cleaned them. He'd roll that cigarette with 
one hand and then strike the match with his thumb

30:48.620 --> 31:08.384
nail and light a cigarette and then flip that match 
way on over yonder somewhere and say, well, what do

30:48.620 --> 31:08.384
you want to talk about this morning?

31:11.247 --> 31:15.252
Well, someone said this morning that, They're 
having an outbreak of anthrax in Louisiana. We

31:19.550 --> 31:26.581
would like to know just exactly how you would 
handle an outbreak of anthrax. So he would spend an

31:28.364 --> 31:40.283
hour, and he would give you all of the government 
regulations, how to handle an anthrax outbreak,

31:28.364 --> 31:40.283
and so on, perfectly. Really? Absolutely 
perfect. But there he is, you can see him with that

31:44.122 --> 31:53.497
big black Stetson, pushed down over there and 
smoking that bulldog cigarette, and talking to

31:44.122 --> 31:53.497
the students. And his feet are up here on the table, 
and he's in an old captain's chair or something

31:53.517 --> 31:59.367
back there. But he would tell you, he knew.

32:07.119 --> 32:09.403
But it really doesn't matter.
