WEBVTT

00:01.077 --> 00:04.270
Recording my experiences down there, you know. 
And there's a tremendous change that's come over

00:05.228 --> 00:10.895
the college. Of course, what I think is far 
different than what most people think. I think it

00:17.043 --> 00:20.768
should never have been changed from a military 
school. I think that they infringed on the rights.

00:24.854 --> 00:32.063
It was dedicated as a military, a land-grant 
college, with the stipulation that military

00:24.854 --> 00:32.063
training would be taught I think it should never 
have been changed. I think it should have been

00:34.700 --> 00:39.888
limited to a certain number of students. I think 
the military standards should have been

00:39.908 --> 00:48.141
improved, elevated, and kept strictly as a 
military school. Now, that's my opinion. That's

00:49.463 --> 00:51.507
not the opinion of others. I think it should never 
become a coeducation. I think that's wrong. But

00:58.758 --> 00:59.940
that's my opinion. Well, you're not alone in your 
opinion. I don't know what percentage of the

01:02.290 --> 01:04.874
people hold that opinion. Well, a lot of them maybe 
wouldn't express their opinion about it, see. But

01:08.620 --> 01:10.724
that's what I think about it. And I'm sorry to see 
the school has grown too big. It's gotten entirely

01:15.451 --> 01:16.773
too big. All colleges have, I guess. Well, a good 
number of them have. I don't know if you know what

01:20.539 --> 01:24.586
the enrollment is now or not. It was 18,500. Yeah. 
last fall and expected to go to 21,000 this fall.

01:33.047 --> 01:37.454
Well, of course, that's an enormous enrollment, 
enormous college. The state's grown, the

01:37.474 --> 01:39.817
country's grown, everything. But I hate to see a 
college, a tradition, you know, and like that

01:40.378 --> 01:49.151
change over so radically. But all it is now is just 
another university. Yeah. Well, I've been told by

01:54.865 --> 02:19.171
people who were there and were, I guess, involved 
in the decisions to make it coeducational and

01:54.865 --> 02:19.171
non-military was that there was some fear that it 
would kind of die off if they didn't do something

01:54.865 --> 02:19.171
because there were not enough boys who wanted to go 
to an all-male military school for it to keep

01:54.865 --> 02:19.171
going. Well. That may be true to a certain extent. 
We're softer than we used to be. That is the people

02:25.307 --> 02:29.671
are, the younger generation. You take the average 
kid now. He wouldn't have gone down there and go

02:31.473 --> 02:39.522
through A&M when I went through it. It'd been too 
rough for him. He wouldn't have stayed there. Hell

02:43.205 --> 02:44.307
no. Like a boy from my hometown, he went down there 
with us. He stayed. two days he saw he wanted to see

02:49.658 --> 03:18.248
and he went back home to mama decided no place for 
him and they wasn't well he's better if he decided

02:49.658 --> 03:18.248
that he's better off at home than those things but 
the a and m has turned out a lot of good men oh yeah and

02:49.658 --> 03:18.248
those things are what made these good men it's not 
it's not air conditioning and luxurious

02:49.658 --> 03:18.248
dormitories and uh big schools that make good men 
it's It's training which makes a good man. There's

03:22.351 --> 03:27.517
nothing better than a good, strong military 
school for a boy. Now that's my opinion. That's the

03:28.999 --> 03:30.921
same opinion my dad had. It might be like you say. 
No, they blamed it on the football team. They said

03:38.691 --> 03:47.181
that the reason they didn't have a football team 
was that they had military training, just like you

03:38.691 --> 03:47.181
said. Then they abandoned that. Then they blamed 
the school. They said they didn't have any girls

03:52.484 --> 03:54.728
down there. They had to get the girls down there so 
the boys could come to school. So they got the girls

03:58.013 --> 03:59.616
down there. So then the football team has been 
going down every year since. So these athletes now

04:13.240 --> 04:20.330
are so petted and pampered, not from college, but 
from the cradle right on up. We've got these little

04:20.771 --> 04:23.996
league teams and all that kind of stuff. And an 
athlete, unless he's a pretty level-headed sort

04:24.016 --> 04:31.647
of a fella, he can't help but be spoiled by the time 
he gets to college. And when they get out of

04:31.747 --> 04:38.978
college, well, then they either go pro or they 
coach or something else, you know. But athletics

04:39.616 --> 04:42.643
is not all there is to an institution. It's good for 
an institution, but it's greatly overdone.

04:45.849 --> 04:46.812
That's my opinion. Greatly overdone. And we used 
to play for fun. Now then, they play for money.

04:58.668 --> 05:00.350
Spirit, spirit. That's what we used to make A&M win 
football games, the spirit. Talking about the

05:03.735 --> 05:09.884
pampering of athletes and so forth, did the 
athletes enjoy any particular privileges when

05:03.735 --> 05:09.884
you were there? Well, we were, we were, that is, the 
athletes were looked up on. They were, in a sense,

05:19.858 --> 05:25.806
sort of idolized, but... They had privileges. 
Yeah, we didn't have to, as I say, we didn't have to

05:27.691 --> 05:40.073
attend maybe certain drills and we didn't have to 
attend retreats and such as that. We were excused.

05:41.776 --> 05:47.305
But outside from that, why there was no great 
special privilege for them, no. Do you have a

05:47.504 --> 05:48.426
training table? Yeah, a training table, yeah. You 
mentioned that you played football. Yeah, I

05:52.616 --> 05:53.778
played football. For how many years? I was down 
there. I was on the team there for a couple of years.

05:58.368 --> 06:01.395
21, 22. I finally made it in 22. We had... We played 
then for the fun of it, for the spirit. See, there

06:13.185 --> 06:15.067
was a lot of spirit, school spirit. I take it there 
were no athletic scholarships when you were

06:15.087 --> 06:17.789
there? No. We just played it. And if a fella come in 
there, a poor boy, and he needed a little help,

06:20.833 --> 06:27.760
somebody helped him. And then he was given a job 
maybe in the dormitory, maybe... waiting on

06:34.130 --> 06:42.140
tables or something like that or on student labor, 
but that was taken care of too. We used to make 20

06:42.180 --> 06:44.984
cents an hour on the student labor. The fellow 
wasn't supposed to make over $20 a month. I mean the

06:49.389 --> 06:51.131
student wasn't supposed to make over $20? He 
couldn't make over $20 a month. That was the limit.

06:53.895 --> 06:57.319
I take it you had a job some of the time that you were 
there. No, I didn't. I wasn't on the student label.

06:59.870 --> 07:01.973
You weren't on the student label before? No, I 
wasn't on the student label. The tuition was cheap

07:05.618 --> 07:07.000
then. I used to pay, I think it was $73.50 every 
semester. That was room and board and tuition?

07:15.993 --> 07:16.734
Room and board. We didn't have any tuition. No 
tuition. Room and board, laundry, and... and you

07:23.084 --> 07:25.567
had to have a little spending money. Well, it 
didn't take much. $0.05 or $10 a month would be all

07:27.930 --> 07:31.235
right for spending money. The dollar went a whole 
hell of a lot farther than that. It didn't cost

07:34.359 --> 07:35.140
much. I went through A&M for about $2,000. 
Amazing. Not so much at A&M, but there are a lot of

07:41.308 --> 07:43.371
schools where they spend that much in a year. Some 
of them spend that much in half a year. Well, I think

07:52.126 --> 07:54.629
there are some schools where the tuition costs you 
that much. I

07:56.371 --> 08:08.887
think we've mentioned one of the things that made 
A&M different is the traditions that the students

07:56.371 --> 08:08.887
carried on. Things such as Yale practice, silver 
taps,

08:16.932 --> 08:20.821
the annual muster, things of that nature, and the 
bonfire. Did you have any of these things when you

08:21.423 --> 08:24.430
were there as a student? I'm sure you had yell 
practice from time to time. Oh yeah, yell practice

08:28.098 --> 08:30.604
if the light was on in the room. They had Yale 
practice after supper. If the light was on the room

08:34.535 --> 08:37.299
in the dormitory, they went up there. Somebody 
went up there and see why it was on. Why you wasn't

08:39.421 --> 08:41.745
out at Yale practice. And if it hadn't been a 
freshman, you got a paddle. You had to be at that

08:44.629 --> 08:46.852
Yale practice. And you had to attend all the games. 
Did you have to attend just the ones in Kiley

08:52.019 --> 08:57.166
Station or did you have to go to all the outages? No, 
we didn't do that. They run a special train every

08:58.748 --> 09:02.613
year to Cotton Palace in Waco. We played at Baylor, 
you know, Cotton Palace. Run a special train. The

09:06.699 --> 09:10.424
whole Corps went down there and they put on a parade 
in the morning. Did you go to Austin too when you

09:11.386 --> 09:13.268
played there? Well, if we could afford it. But that 
wasn't a special train then? No. You know, that

09:18.796 --> 09:22.084
wasn't a special train. But I don't know who paid 
for that special train. We used to meter away a lot

09:27.496 --> 09:30.222
of times. A lot of kids would beat their way, you 
know, they'd make a freshman buy a ticket. and then

09:36.076 --> 10:04.497
the conductor he'd get he'd have to be on these 
special planes the conductor just hated those

09:36.076 --> 10:04.497
things you know they just give us much trouble and 
we'd have a sticker a yellow ticket

09:36.076 --> 10:04.497
well i just tell anybody i'd have a fish you know 
Somebody would have a fish, and they'd say, well,

10:04.983 --> 10:11.552
now, if you want to go to this Waco trip here, you buy 
a ticket. And then he'd buy a ticket, and then he'd

10:12.854 --> 10:18.962
get that yellow slip. So then he'd

10:21.265 --> 10:28.695
work his way up to the front of the train with that 
yellow slip, and he'd pass it to me or somebody

10:29.722 --> 10:35.489
else, and I'd put it in my hat seat. So the 
conductor, he'd come by, and he'd see that yellow

10:35.509 --> 10:39.054
slip, and he'd just pass on by. So then when the 
conductor got back so far, we have these, you know

10:39.915 --> 10:49.607
how these trains connect? Yeah. They used to 
connect. You could have a passway in there. Well,

10:54.734 --> 10:57.197
underneath was some steps, you know, where you 
stepped down. So we just opened those doors and put

10:57.548 --> 11:04.677
the freshman under there, or somebody would, and 
the conductor's never seen him. He'd just go on by.

11:06.339 --> 11:10.844
So if the conductor, after he went through once, 
that was enough. He'd had enough of that. So then we

11:12.766 --> 11:17.332
used to put him on a seat and cover him up with a bunch 
of overcoats. We'd cover the upperclassmen up

11:17.352 --> 11:19.695
with a bunch of overcoats. So that's the way we made 
the trip. And I went down there once, and I went

11:26.472 --> 11:29.937
free, and then when they got to the Cotton Palace, 
why, they gave us a dollar. And that was in trade,

11:31.580 --> 11:34.364
see. That entitled us to buy, and we could take that 
dollar, that coupon, and cash it in for a dollar on

11:34.384 --> 11:44.880
the ground, see, when we got to the Cotton Palace. 
So this is the way we used to, and we did this just for

11:44.900 --> 11:49.768
fun. It really wasn't, it was a kind of a game with 
us. So that's the way I got by, and then I got mixed up

11:54.805 --> 12:02.212
in the crap game coming back on 90 cents out of here. 
So I come out all

12:02.232 --> 12:08.857
right. We know that from off and on there were a few 
girls like faculty, professors' daughters and

12:08.998 --> 12:16.104
things like that in school. Were there any of them 
there when you were there? Yeah, there's a girl

12:18.186 --> 12:20.188
named Jones. And you ever heard of Oscar Frazier? I 
believe I have. Well, she married Oscar Frey. She

12:26.411 --> 12:28.894
used to sit right next to me in chem class. And her 
father was a chem prop there in organic chemistry.

12:32.478 --> 12:35.663
And there was a rule then that they loosen it up a 
little.

12:39.347 --> 12:47.678
The professors, if they had a daughter and they 
lived on the campus, this daughter, they could let

12:39.347 --> 12:47.678
this daughter go to school if she wanted to. And all 
this liberality started with World War I. When

12:52.703 --> 12:57.751
these veterans returned, we used to have what we 
called the casuals, casual company. They were

12:57.771 --> 13:02.238
down in Milner Hall after it was vacated by the 
military. And they were veterans of World War I.

13:07.081 --> 13:14.854
Somebody got the idea that veterans shouldn't be 
made to take military training again unless you

13:07.081 --> 13:14.854
wanted to. Now there were some veterans in the 
Corps too, a lot of veterans in there, but these

13:14.934 --> 13:22.326
boys didn't want to take military training. 
That's when things

13:22.446 --> 13:32.262
really started back then with this casual 
company. Then somebody got the idea that A&M

13:33.187 --> 13:43.808
students should not be compelled to take military 
training for their entire school life. Did they

13:44.910 --> 13:46.673
ever start any? start this the system while you 
were there whereby you could go to military

13:47.800 --> 14:15.023
training two years and be a casual for two no even if 
you hadn't been in the service that came in later

13:47.800 --> 14:15.023
then that was way after i left there oh you you went 
there you took four years of military training

13:47.800 --> 14:15.023
unless you had been a uh all all freshmen were 
privates uh sophomore where the corporals were

13:47.800 --> 14:15.023
picked from the sophomore class The sergeants 
were picked from the junior class. All juniors

14:18.376 --> 14:20.138
were sergeants. They had war stripes. All seniors 
were cadet officers. Before that, way back, they

14:27.185 --> 14:30.189
had what they called senior privates. And they had 
the old bellhop uniform. When I was there, every

14:33.552 --> 14:38.077
senior was a commissioned officer. The second 
lieutenant on it. So they had no more senior

14:40.920 --> 14:43.003
privates when you were there? No more senior 
privates. And every junior was a sergeant of some

14:44.973 --> 14:51.723
kind. And the corporals then were picked from the 
sophomore class. But not necessarily every

14:55.708 --> 14:58.232
sophomore was a corporal. No, no, no. They didn't 
have too many corporals.

15:09.047 --> 15:10.309
Let's see. You graduated in the spring of 22. Did 
you have a job? No, I was down there in the SATC. So we

15:24.128 --> 15:31.759
started in, we had a few classes, and then the 
classes were suspended. Then they sent me to the

15:32.560 --> 15:33.922
hospital. I worked over in the hospital most of my 
time down there the first semester. It was when

15:40.778 --> 15:41.940
they had a lot of flu. That was when they had a lot of 
flu. I worked over there in the hospital. I was an

15:44.664 --> 15:45.525
orderly. They didn't have a medical corps then. 
They just picked the details out of a company to go

15:48.469 --> 15:53.016
to the hospital. I guess I did good over there. They 
just kept me over there. Maybe forgot about me. I

15:57.242 --> 15:58.664
don't know. So then after the thing was over, then 
they started the next semester after the first

15:58.684 --> 16:08.659
year and they gave the Those that were in the 
freshman class had a chance to complete their work

16:09.837 --> 16:16.305
in five months. So I got behind. I didn't complete 
mine successfully. I got behind. I never was much

16:21.993 --> 16:24.616
of a student. Like old Doc Salisbury told me one 
day, he says, Mr. Lieber, you ought to be out behind

16:25.517 --> 16:33.448
the plow. You haven't got any business in here. And 
he is about right. So he wasn't far at all. So I

16:39.335 --> 16:40.977
busted geology, too. That's another stiff one for 
me. But it's like an old bracket. He was an English

16:46.364 --> 16:51.471
professor, and he said he didn't know which was the 
smartest. A man go through college and make all A's

16:51.491 --> 16:57.379
and B's, or a man go through college and never crack 
a book. So

16:57.399 --> 17:02.166
that's the way the thing turned out. So I was in 
the... I finished, left there in February of 1923.

17:09.651 --> 17:14.097
I was there in the fall of 22. I was behind my class. 
Four and a half years. Yeah, I didn't feel like

17:21.707 --> 17:28.996
taking the 23 class because I didn't stay to finish 
there. I didn't stay in the spring and so I just

17:29.016 --> 17:35.785
took, I think it's three subjects. in

17:36.862 --> 17:41.349
the fall of 22. I just had three subjects. Just 
enough to get my degree. Okay. Did you have a job

17:47.458 --> 17:49.661
lined up by the time you left school? No, things 
were tight then. They had that panic.

17:58.074 --> 18:00.658
So I thought I wanted to be a county agent. And I 
couldn't connect anywhere. They said they had

18:05.551 --> 18:09.416
more county agents than they needed running out 
there. So I went to work then for a feed mill, just

18:10.818 --> 18:16.265
check aboard feed. And they were recruiting. They 
were after these fellas then, these college boys.

18:23.495 --> 18:24.416
So they were recruiting. I didn't have any trouble 
getting a job there with them. So I carried a grip

18:27.537 --> 18:34.884
farm for about 10 years and I quit and went to 
farming. And where all did you work for Purina? I

18:38.889 --> 18:44.094
worked about four years in Mississippian and I 
worked the rest of the year, about six years out

18:38.889 --> 18:44.094
here. So in El Paso? That's what brought me to El 
Paso. I've come out here from the Fort Worth now.

18:51.221 --> 18:56.987
And so what, about 33 or 34, somewhere 
thereabouts, you quit them and started the farm?

18:57.406 --> 18:59.248
Yeah, I quit. Well, I had a case of the flu in 32, and I 
had double pneumonia. Then a lung specialist told

19:06.837 --> 19:18.330
me I had TB, and so I took the cure for about two 
years, I guess. So after that, I at that time do a lot

19:21.233 --> 19:25.339
of thinking, so I said, well, hell, I'm going to get 
out here and farm. A lot of these, about half these

19:25.760 --> 19:34.834
valleys, this valley here, this farm is made up of 
lungards and chicken people and stuff like that.

19:34.895 --> 19:38.420
There's a lot of veterans out here that have to be 
beat. So what kind of farming did you do initially?

19:41.485 --> 19:43.248
I started in cotton farming. How much acreage did 
you farm? oh i found i finally i was broke and i

19:47.204 --> 20:04.504
scratched around down here and i finally acquired 
this property here and it was six acres in it and

19:47.204 --> 20:04.504
then i uh made a little cotton crop and i had a little 
money and i built the house here i made pretty good

20:05.682 --> 20:34.575
wages building the house with myself and a bunch of 
mexicans i had mexican craftsmen you know helping

20:05.682 --> 20:34.575
me i did the carpenter work and so forth and then i uh 
got the farming out here and i had kind of got my foot

20:05.682 --> 20:34.575
in the door and then people there were then at that 
time were anxious to rent land but all this thing

20:05.682 --> 20:34.575
around here was cotton farms now stop there wasn't 
There wasn't any houses around here at all. So they

20:39.882 --> 20:42.405
offered me the rent and the land. I kind of got 
started that way. I made a little money, finally. I

20:48.934 --> 20:52.819
finally bought more land, just kept buying land, 
bit by bit. Other

20:54.100 --> 20:59.087
things happened. So I sold my land and paid off my 
debts. up this place here. So then I lost some more

21:06.429 --> 21:09.432
money in investments. You can't win all the time. 
You roll a dice, you're going to crap out

21:10.654 --> 21:13.817
sometimes. You can't win all the time. Nothing 
good ever lasts. Oh, remember that. Nothing good

21:18.301 --> 21:20.744
ever lasts. That's one thing you want to remember, 
young man. Nothing good ever lasts. Something

21:25.589 --> 21:26.870
will hit you. You got a good job today, and tomorrow 
you don't have one. So be prepared. So you farmed,

21:34.462 --> 21:39.990
what was the highest or greatest acreage you ever 
had for farming? Oh, I was a small fry. I

21:42.853 --> 21:51.806
was, oh,

21:42.853 --> 21:51.806
I farmed about 100 and 150, maybe 125 acres. And 
then I finally acquired 25 acres here in my own

21:51.926 --> 21:57.954
right. I had a nice little farm here, 25 acres, and 
then I rented land all around, you see. And just an

22:03.200 --> 22:07.204
old sharecropper, you say, you might say. And then 
ultimately you sold it all off with the four you

22:07.224 --> 22:11.229
have now. That's right. Sold it all off to 
subdivisions, those houses over there. Used to be

22:16.314 --> 22:17.015
my land across the road. Yeah, got rid of it. I saw 
the handwriting on the wall finally. I quit in 62.

22:24.443 --> 22:25.004
Quit farming. Quit

22:25.264 --> 22:28.648
farming in 62. And then did you move off the farm? 
You moved off the farm for a while. Well, see, I used

22:32.984 --> 22:36.770
to live on the North Loop over here. I had a nice home 
over there, and I lived over there. Like all these

22:40.275 --> 22:47.807
plot hoppers do, you know, I had to go to town, so I 
had to go into town. Better neighborhood and

22:47.847 --> 22:51.633
everything over there, you know. So I moved over 
there, and my wife died. So then we settled the

22:54.658 --> 22:59.886
estate, and I come up short, so I can back over 
there.

23:03.308 --> 23:07.336
I'm just getting by. I built these little houses 
and I rent them. A lot of people think I'm rich, but

23:12.265 --> 23:16.494
I'm not. It's all misleading. They've just got the 
idea and can't get it out of their head, but I'm not.

23:24.409 --> 23:25.992
That's why I shouldn't be, but I'm not. Well, I 
suppose people that have a posted stamp yard look

23:26.360 --> 23:32.972
at you and you've got four acres and they say, my, he 
must be rich. Well, they come down here, you know,

23:33.273 --> 23:41.668
and they look around and say, God, darn, I wish I had 
this place. Nice places. I just like to have

23:42.832 --> 23:47.198
something of this when I retire. See, I do all this 
myself. I'm 75 years old, and I do all this myself

23:50.242 --> 23:54.508
every day. I'm in good health, and that's what 
keeps me in good health. Inactivity, cigarettes,

23:59.395 --> 24:07.926
and rotten gut booze is killing the young people, 
even the Mexicans. In 20 years, if they don't back

24:09.745 --> 24:16.314
up and start over, there'll be a hospital on every 
corner, and they won't be able to take care of them.

24:16.334 --> 24:21.261
The heart attacks, the strokes, the cancers, all 
that. That's right. I see now there's statistics

24:24.145 --> 24:38.706
that you were reading yesterday that one in every 
three families in the United States, they

24:24.145 --> 24:38.706
predicted one in every three families in the 
United States would be hit by cancer.

24:42.770 --> 24:43.451
Astonishing. Yeah. And I guess the heart attacks 
and things like that are getting more and more

24:45.173 --> 24:49.819
frequent and younger and younger. Cigarettes, 
inactivity, and booze, rock gut booze, this old

24:50.240 --> 24:55.807
beer. These old Mexicans around here, some of 
them, you just stick a needle in them, the beer just

24:56.548 --> 25:02.236
spews. Big high school kids looked like they had a 
rubber tube around their waist here, inner tube,

25:03.017 --> 25:09.385
see? No condition whatever, little legs, table 
legs, big bellies. Once in a while you see one young

25:16.567 --> 25:23.557
Mexican, 23 or 24 years old, have a belly on him like 
he's 45 or 50. Yeah. Go in the pipe, boy. That's

25:27.603 --> 25:30.607
right. Just think about it. So what men having 35, 
40 years old having heart attacks, 50 years old,

25:41.393 --> 25:44.238
our artifacts. Not right. Don't make sense. What 
do you produce mostly, or if anything, on your farm

25:47.444 --> 25:50.729
now? Well, I just sowed the whole thing down in 
Bermuda grass. And what I've got here, I take a few

25:57.401 --> 26:00.947
horses, pasture. I've got these houses I rent.

26:06.352 --> 26:10.296
I've got a few sheep. And a few fig trees. A few fig 
trees. And I just sit down here and let the world go

26:12.338 --> 26:14.360
by. And I get to hoeing someday and I think, well, 
you old fool, what in the hell are you staying out

26:14.380 --> 26:18.905
here for? You ought to be in town making a lot of 
money. And then I get to thinking about how I'm

26:21.928 --> 26:25.952
going to make that money. So I say, well, you old 
fool, you better stay here a while. At least you got

26:29.115 --> 26:30.156
your health. Good health is the world's greatest 
blessing.

26:37.435 --> 26:40.158
If you've got good health, you're rich. You're 
rich. There's nothing in the world that can take

26:43.160 --> 26:46.083
the place of good health. I know because I've had 
mine and I've lost it, and I got it back by mean

26:46.103 --> 26:53.991
strength and awkwardness. But, you know, there's 
two boys in my football squad down there who died

26:54.071 --> 27:04.641
with tuberculosis.

27:05.347 --> 27:15.166
I think both of those boys could have been saved if 
they'd have been, had the right attitude maybe and

27:05.347 --> 27:15.166
they'd have got it in time.

27:16.248 --> 27:17.130
Big fellas too. Old Spot Hanna, he could kick a 
football, boy he could place a kick a football 40

27:17.972 --> 27:24.324
yards. He was a guy who weighed 210 pounds. He 
played a guard. He was really a place kicker. And

27:32.976 --> 27:36.380
Dick Wilson, he was a tackle. He weighed about 200 
and about the same as Old Spock. And big old raw

27:41.045 --> 27:43.828
ball, West Texas boy. Engineer, got down here in 
South America or Central America somewhere and

27:44.789 --> 27:53.838
started running the temperature and they told him 
he had tropical fever. When he finally got back

27:53.858 --> 27:57.122
here in the States, he had one of his lungs gone. 
That's the way it is. You never know. And health is

28:05.469 --> 28:07.154
the greatest blessing. So take care of your 
health.
