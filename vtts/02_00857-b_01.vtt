WEBVTT

00:02.039 --> 00:12.993
functioned as they should until, and would 
continue to until the Farmers Home

00:02.039 --> 00:12.993
Administration got stuck in it. Now our 
philosophy here was the farmers would do it all and

00:14.816 --> 00:25.250
nobody was going to put any money on

00:14.816 --> 00:25.250
them. They went over here in this one in Houston 
County which was a beautiful community setup,

00:31.148 --> 00:41.222
and gave them, I think, $10,000. And

00:41.242 --> 00:50.195
the next thing I knew, they were having a squabble 
on how they were going to spend that $10,000, and

00:41.242 --> 00:50.195
the thing blew up.

00:53.700 --> 00:56.044
But at any rate, Bill didn't have any use for them. 
And I had to have a job. And I did a little farming

01:01.321 --> 01:07.668
back some 15 and a half years ago.

01:12.433 --> 01:19.220
And I started digging into soils, soil 
improvement and fertilizers.

01:22.764 --> 01:30.332
And when I quit in 57, I was the recognized 
authority in agriculture on the three.

01:33.147 --> 01:35.210
Now don't anybody know as it came along.

01:38.755 --> 01:42.220
But the war came on. By the way, the Tennessee 
Valley Authority would furnish

01:44.483 --> 02:02.007
fertilizer to any group of farmers that I would 
recommend if they agreed to run demonstrations

02:04.248 --> 02:07.892
according to the plans that I drew up.

02:10.935 --> 02:16.701
And when I say I drew up, I'm the finest corn grower 
in Nacogdoches County. I said, well, that's fine.

02:17.621 --> 02:18.502
I'm glad to meet you. I'd like for you to run an 
experiment.

02:23.527 --> 02:24.288
Good, I will. I said, I want you to take your 
fertilizer distributor and go up and down four

02:25.149 --> 02:34.018
rows. four times with it. Then you step over here 
and go up and down four rows three times. Then you

02:41.725 --> 02:46.950
get over here and go up and down four rows two times, 
and the rest of you feel just weird like you've been

02:41.725 --> 02:46.950
doing. He thought, I'll do it. I went back over 
there in the fall. Corn had been harvested. I saw

02:58.422 --> 02:59.483
this old duck unloading some fertilizer that I had 
authorized to be shipped in. He didn't remember me

03:03.520 --> 03:08.788
from, the only one there that knew me was the county 
agent. I asked him, I said, Miss, do you ever grow

03:10.931 --> 03:13.175
any corn? Yes, sir, I'm the finest corn grower in 
Nacogdoches County. Is that right? I said, have

03:18.663 --> 03:20.386
you ever used fertilizer? Yes, sir. How much do you 
use? 400 pounds to the acres, the finest

03:25.484 --> 03:29.310
fertilizer in the world. I said, don't it burn the 
stuff up? He jumped off his old lopsided wagon,

03:32.034 --> 03:41.349
shook his finger in my face, and said, trouble you 
young fellas, you don't use enough fertilizer to

03:32.034 --> 03:41.349
draw. Fellas are listening. I said, you're so 
right. I said, I'd like to see you try 600 pounds.

03:48.741 --> 03:49.262
I'll do it. Now that sort of there

03:55.184 --> 04:23.436
were

03:55.184 --> 04:23.436
two

03:55.184 --> 04:23.436
things that i swore i was going to do we've always 
considered legumes as an excellent soil

03:55.184 --> 04:23.436
improving crop

04:26.858 --> 04:27.819
Everybody did. I was there with it enough to 
believe it.

04:33.648 --> 04:37.173
And I was going to have a legume crop planted in 
every county in the state. I missed it. It was one I

04:39.597 --> 04:40.718
couldn't get.

04:43.783 --> 04:48.850
I was going to double the amount of fertilizer used 
in Texas by 1950.

04:51.513 --> 04:53.816
I changed my records. In 1947, I was going to double 
it again

04:53.836 --> 04:59.602
by 1950. In 1950, I was going to double it by 1955, 
and we passed that again. Now that's going back to

05:05.068 --> 05:08.032
the 1945 race. Now I have no idea what the ratio in 
there is. I just haven't kept up. But the amount of

05:16.301 --> 05:20.946
fertilizer being used has resolved to those foods 
things that I did and my assistants and my helpers

05:22.057 --> 05:32.451
and my associates are responsible for this 
agricultural explosion in Texas. But, as I said,

05:34.935 --> 05:41.544
these folks don't know I've been along, which is 
all right. Remember, the dead can't live forever.

05:44.328 --> 05:47.612
The old can't live forever. I think anybody going 
back to Wright the history of agricultural

05:49.951 --> 05:56.179
development, Texas will certainly have to 
include this and who the people were that helped

05:49.951 --> 05:56.179
make it. Well, they're not. Oh, I wouldn't say 
that. I know some people that are probably maybe

06:00.304 --> 06:05.150
getting ready to do some American cultural 
history of Texas.

06:09.215 --> 06:19.367
So, as I said, back in 1935 or 1936, I got us a 
portable soil testing kit.

06:22.047 --> 06:33.359
didn't take me long to see that these kits that were 
built up in the northern states just weren't worth

06:22.047 --> 06:33.359
a nickel in Texas.

06:33.379 --> 06:39.886
We had different conditions, so I took off and 
built my own. And the result of my work

06:42.709 --> 06:48.595
and the work being done under Fudge in the state 
chemist's lab. I can't think of the fellow's name.

06:55.709 --> 06:56.510
Asbury? No, no, old Asbury.

07:00.634 --> 07:02.797
No, let's let that ride.

07:06.441 --> 07:11.767
This, I'll cut that out too.

07:11.787 --> 07:12.608
But

07:29.547 --> 07:42.087
Oh, I built this kit, and I would go out to this farm 
and take soil samples and test them. And he

07:42.107 --> 07:44.390
wouldn't believe them. Certainly not. That's 
brand new stuff. He didn't do that. So I'd

07:48.537 --> 07:53.945
go and take this growing cotton. I'd go get a half a 
dozen leaves. off of this cotton that's just going

07:57.728 --> 08:01.173
to make about one bale and ten acres. I'd go down 
here, I'd get about a half a dozen leaves off of some

08:02.034 --> 08:09.204
cotton that's going to make about a half a bale and 
ten acres. I'd test them. Now his eyes would bug

08:14.912 --> 08:16.214
out.

08:19.318 --> 08:22.603
Now, I kept that up. There are a lot of interesting 
stories there that come up with as you go along

08:27.260 --> 08:28.582
through that. And in 1950,

08:29.864 --> 08:49.293
I guess it was,

08:29.864 --> 08:49.293
they talked the state chemist into running the 
analyses with the understanding that I wrote the

08:29.864 --> 08:49.293
recommendations.

08:52.037 --> 08:55.562
Now, in order to get the state chemist to do that, it 
took lots of doing. Because Fraps insisted there

08:57.162 --> 09:02.828
was no way in the world you could run a soil test and 
predict what happened. And he fought soil testing

09:04.429 --> 09:09.174
with everything that he had. Well, his successor 
Fudge was a little more liberal. And when I yanked

09:15.721 --> 09:27.152
him out of his marble chair and took him out in the 
country with me, I let him see what was going on. He

09:28.060 --> 09:37.809
then decided that he would go into it, and they went 
into it with the understanding that every soil

09:28.060 --> 09:37.809
sample was a dollar, which was all right. But that 
still wasn't satisfactory, so I, with another

09:40.071 --> 09:56.245
fellow, as I said, I can't think of his name, took a 
trip around the states that were using soil

09:40.071 --> 09:56.245
testing to get their ideas. among which was 
Oklahoma, Arkansas, Mississippi, Kentucky,

09:57.862 --> 10:05.351
Illinois, Iowa, and Missouri. We came back here 
and set up the laboratory we have here. I go to the

10:11.138 --> 10:16.885
laboratory here now and see what they're doing. 
It's amazing. Back in those days, we did

10:19.608 --> 10:22.772
everything by

10:26.262 --> 10:29.766
strong methods and awkwardness. Nowadays, 
you've got these electronic machines. They'll

10:36.834 --> 10:41.779
run the soil out now and give you analyses on that 
thing there that I never dreamed of. As I said,

10:42.580 --> 10:45.283
that's part of this thing that I mentioned way back 
here. The chemistry is just boiling. And what

10:49.267 --> 10:54.733
you're up to data in today, you're out of data on 
tomorrow. And that's the way it ought to be. That's

10:58.104 --> 10:58.725
fine. I hate to like Rip to be an old has-been, but 
then I'm not going to do the fighting and the

11:00.007 --> 11:10.321
working and the studying to stay up when I can get 
out here in the garden and have a good time.

11:13.306 --> 11:16.069
So that's another thing. And when I quit in 57, this 
soil testing laboratory was another one of my

11:16.089 --> 11:25.783
babies that was Well, it's certainly recognized 
throughout the state. A lot of people use its

11:30.088 --> 11:31.970
facilities. Yeah, we built several. We built two 
or three branch

11:33.813 --> 11:44.387
laboratories and regional laboratories. I 
always thought Oklahoma had the county, and

11:44.447 --> 11:50.134
Mississippi had the county, and I fought those. 
The county doesn't have anything more to do than

11:50.835 --> 11:53.779
run soil tests. he better fire him, and

11:54.755 --> 12:09.743
we build those reasonable and set up the 
laboratory from here, and that functioned very,

11:54.755 --> 12:09.743
very well.

12:13.370 --> 12:17.758
So these are really some of your most important 
accomplishments while you were working for So

12:17.907 --> 12:24.735
that's another way that answered a question 
without my having to ask it. Anything else you'd

12:24.755 --> 12:26.297
like to comment on?

12:30.261 --> 12:31.102
Oh, I don't know. You don't know. Well... You sit 
around here and talk long enough, I have some other

12:32.123 --> 12:38.871
stuff, but then you'll have something else to do. 
Oh, no, I don't have anything to do today, really.

12:53.851 --> 12:59.138
in my living around here is the ingenuity and the 
ability of the students. The radio tower on top of

13:01.521 --> 13:13.856
Milne Hall was put in, I would say, about 19, the 
summer of 1913 or maybe 14. And

13:13.876 --> 13:20.685
one morning we woke up. And a young fellow, his name 
was Cohen, rode a bicycle to and from work. And that

13:30.204 --> 13:33.507
darn bicycle was tied to the top of that radio 
tower. How in the name of common sense that bunch

13:35.670 --> 13:43.719
got that bicycle up there, I'll never know. They 
finally got it down, and I guess the fellow put it up

13:43.739 --> 13:49.085
there is the one who brought it down. But now there 
is something. That is just one thing. Well,

13:54.506 --> 13:55.667
there's another one. If you'll notice on Milner 
Hall, there's little alcoves up there. Came along

14:03.058 --> 14:11.169
one morning going to work, and there was a shut-lit 
pony in that alcove on the third floor. You

14:11.189 --> 14:13.633
couldn't have walked him up there. How in the world 
they got him up there, I'll never know. I had to...

14:20.538 --> 14:25.003
Just sitting here, as I said, thinking there'll be 
some others just as wild. You can cut it off now.

14:29.347 --> 14:45.524
When I first came here in the spring months,

14:29.347 --> 14:45.524
the band would meet every Sunday afternoon in the 
bandstand that was out on the edge of the drill

14:29.347 --> 14:45.524
field. And people from Brown would drive out in 
their horses and buggies. And Goodman Hall was

14:51.706 --> 14:56.434
over there as a dormitory. And boys would be 
sticking out, looking at that, and just as sure as

14:57.576 --> 15:12.681
they had one of those, one of those boys would 
presumably fall out a window. They'd take their

15:12.781 --> 15:18.270
dummy and dress him up, and when they got down to the 
right point, they'd push him out. And finally, I

15:18.571 --> 15:21.476
break up that damn chance. As

15:21.916 --> 15:33.234
I said, back then, we organized a basketball team. 
But the first thing we did in fall of 1912, I guess it

15:33.254 --> 15:41.527
was, we organized a football team. On that 
football team, we had an All-American from

15:43.790 --> 15:46.975
Cornell. all Missouri Valley,

15:47.444 --> 16:00.319
Iowa, all southern, center, and

15:47.444 --> 16:00.319
South Carolina. In other words, it was made up of a 
bunch of fellows that taught here that had played

16:02.141 --> 16:07.968
football and knew the way around. But, you know, we 
couldn't get with 11 men. So, well, no, we couldn't

16:11.472 --> 16:13.755
get 11. We had two that we organized as standing 
guards. With this bird, you know, at Thermopylae,

16:20.045 --> 16:24.209
you stand up there and need not let him pass. And 
their jobs were not to let anybody through. They

16:27.411 --> 16:31.135
did nothing about football, but they're both 
powerful men. And just don't let that other fellow

16:32.836 --> 16:35.378
through. You just take care of him. And be sure you 
get the man that's got the football.

16:43.785 --> 16:44.586
The others, played and the rest of us ran the team. 
Tommy Ogier was quarterback. Who was that? Tommy

16:52.390 --> 16:53.211
Ogier. You never heard of him? No, I haven't. He 
died here about three or four years ago. Well, we

16:59.340 --> 17:08.953
went out there and played the C Company and they 
thought a good chance to get even with the

16:59.340 --> 17:08.953
professors. The half of us didn't realize they 
were working fellows that had cut their teeth in

17:11.043 --> 17:23.538
big-time football, and for a little amateur 
company team to haul off and rough them up a little

17:11.043 --> 17:23.538
bit was just asking for trouble. So the morning 
after they played the C Company, there were about

17:24.759 --> 17:30.386
15 in the hospital. And the next time we played was 
the band.

17:38.376 --> 17:39.497
And the same thing happened. I know most of the band 
was in the hospital. And we weren't hurt. We were

17:45.216 --> 17:47.199
just taking the thing in the stride. Then Charlie 
Moran decided that I didn't, he says, I don't have a

17:49.342 --> 17:54.871
game for Saturday. How about you fellas playing 
Thursday or Friday? Playing the reserves, not the

18:00.880 --> 18:03.664
first team. Now a lot of boys think it's the first 
team. It wasn't the first team. Doggone it that

18:08.232 --> 18:21.512
morning before we were going to play, our center, 
Missouri Valley, had to have an appendix out. And

18:21.532 --> 18:33.029
they had a fellow they could put out on end that had a 
little sense about football but not a whole lot. So

18:34.391 --> 18:37.395
they elected me to take that center place.

18:39.991 --> 18:45.258
And I can assure you the fellow that was playing on 
the other side was using something beside his

18:39.991 --> 18:45.258
body. I think he had a club in his hand where it could 
be over. But man, oh man, the reserves beat us five

18:50.426 --> 19:05.567
to nothing just because that doggone replacement 
of mine let the halfback on the reserve team get

18:50.426 --> 19:05.567
outside him. And they finally brought him down on 
about the five yard line, and they did put the

19:10.518 --> 19:17.809
cross, they earned it, but we couldn't score.

19:21.194 --> 19:31.130
Next morning, President Miller issued one of the 
many foolish edicts that comes out of the

19:21.194 --> 19:31.130
president's office. He said, in the future, no 
member of the teaching staff will participate in

19:32.672 --> 19:37.740
any hazardous or dangerous games. That is the most 
foolish thing that ever happened. If you'd have

19:43.059 --> 19:47.587
handed a football at any of them, they'd have 
turned the ball like that. They wouldn't have even

19:48.248 --> 19:49.470
touched it. Man, how wicked we took. Five to 
nothing. It wasn't a bad game. But that was the

19:54.738 --> 19:56.481
cleanest game we played. The games against the 
company teams. The boys didn't use their head. But

20:03.853 --> 20:05.736
against the reserves, it was a clean game. But they 
were hitting and they were hitting hard.
