00:04.672 --> 00:18.348
People like this have been coming by and of course I 
would never get much of a chance to talk to this

00:04.672 --> 00:18.348
level of persons without this program. It's been 
very interesting. How long have you been working

00:18.949 --> 00:21.712
on this? Actually since 1974. It's got some very 
good technology in it. In the process we think

00:25.657 --> 00:29.902
we've discovered a brand new principle of heat 
transfer for example. At least I've been teaching

00:30.863 --> 00:33.987
heat transfer for many many many years. I'd never 
heard about it nor has anyone else in our

00:34.490 --> 00:38.093
department heard about it. There's some real 
challenges of making a system like this that

00:40.035 --> 00:58.231
really does work and meets the criteria that would 
have to be met to make it practical in terms of

00:40.035 --> 00:58.231
compact size, dependability, and that kind

00:40.035 --> 00:58.231
of thing. We also have some other ideas we're 
working on now that we expect, frankly, premature

00:58.251 --> 01:04.497
but We expect them to be such that they will 
absolutely mandate the use of alcohol for cars

01:04.983 --> 01:18.583
simply because of the improvement that you

01:04.983 --> 01:18.583
get. How long have you been working on the other 
project that you've been doing? This solitaire

01:21.468 --> 01:22.850
scheme? Oh, I can't remember when we first 
conceived of it. Now, it was way back in the 60s.

01:29.199 --> 01:32.945
Dick and I used to sit around and- Who was this other 
person? Dr. Davis. Richard R. Davison, who's a

01:33.738 --> 01:37.062
compadre here in the department. Davison, 
without the D. And actually, we came up with the

01:37.242 --> 01:48.156
concept and applied for a patent long before we got 
active in the research area. So, that particular

01:48.977 --> 01:50.980
patent is owned by us. Now, the other one, of 
course, was on a car, was received here at the

01:51.961 --> 01:58.189
university. No, it was such a novel idea, it sailed 
right on through. How long did it take? That one

02:04.568 --> 02:06.853
went through faster than we would have liked. It 
turned out that because of the embargo, any patent

02:07.654 --> 02:14.428
application that had anything to do with energy 
was given favored treatment. And it went through

02:15.370 --> 02:17.274
in about a year and a half. The reason we wish it had 
taken another five or six years is because patents

02:18.336 --> 02:26.172
only last fifteen years in this country.

02:28.379 --> 02:33.587
Frankly, it's going to take at least 10 or 12 years 
before this system even gets a good try. So that

02:33.627 --> 02:35.831
doesn't leave you a lot of time on your patent. Had 
they delayed for another four or five years as they

02:35.851 --> 02:48.711
normally do in getting a patent, then it would just 
now be, well, it would have come out, but it would be

02:35.851 --> 02:48.711
worth at least four or five more years of life. 
Well, then, do you devote equal time to teaching

02:49.252 --> 02:54.600
and research? Well, everybody in our department I 
guess everybody is working both research and

02:57.843 --> 03:02.208
teaching. Our department is a little bit unique in 
that everybody, according to the university

03:03.229 --> 03:13.841
formula, teaches full time, which means all of 
their research is in addition to that.

03:16.924 --> 03:24.272
It's kind of a comfortable position to be in 
because you're not subject to research monies as

03:16.924 --> 03:24.272
to whether you're going to be able to be paid or not. 
but it's a little bit uncomfortable in that it

03:25.130 --> 03:29.635
works the very tail off of everybody in the 
department.

03:39.526 --> 03:46.133
What are some of the changes that you've seen in 
electrical and chemical engineering since

03:39.526 --> 03:46.133
you've been at A&M? Of course the most outstanding 
change here at A&M has been the increase in

03:46.153 --> 03:52.420
feminine students. Initially we had no students 
here that were girls, and even chem engineering

03:53.328 --> 04:07.069
departments in other schools only had usually one 
every three or four years, who incidentally

03:53.328 --> 04:07.069
always turned out to be the top students for some 
reason. And now we have approximately one of,

04:08.732 --> 04:15.442
somewhere between one of four or one of five of our 
undergraduates is a girl. So this has been a very

04:16.263 --> 04:19.688
distinctive change. How long has this change been 
underway? Oh, it started with when Earl Rudder

04:22.792 --> 04:26.096
took over.

04:28.760 --> 04:36.129
First it started that just girls who were 
daughters of the profs and so forth could attend

04:28.760 --> 04:36.129
and then spread out until it's now here. The other 
thing that's been amazing here is the rapid growth

04:36.149 --> 04:40.054
of the department. In just the last few years, 
we've increased approximately 400 or 500 percent

04:40.075 --> 04:47.384
in enrollment. The big shock I have there is that 
the quality of students I thought would drop. as

04:52.137 --> 04:58.006
the enrollment increased, and actually it seems 
that we're getting better qualified students now

04:52.137 --> 04:58.006
than we used to get. Why do you suppose that is? I 
think the high schools are doing a better job.

05:05.397 --> 05:07.180
At least that would be my guess. Our SAT scores are 
very, very high.

05:12.928 --> 05:17.716
Why do you have so few blacks in engineering? Do you 
have any ideas on that? As far as I know, there has

05:19.340 --> 05:26.226
been no, absolutely no discrimination against 
blacks in our department. I have noticed a great

05:27.488 --> 05:31.952
deal on the campus as far as that is concerned. Our 
student, American Institute of Chemical

05:31.972 --> 05:38.058
Engineering Society president was black here a 
few years ago. I don't think the students have any

05:38.118 --> 05:40.180
discrimination. We have graduated over,

05:40.240 --> 05:49.228
I don't know, a dozen or two dozen blacks.

05:50.828 --> 06:00.121
I think our problem primarily is that we just 
haven't been able to get them to either come or to

05:50.828 --> 06:00.121
stay in our program. And I don't know exactly why 
this is.

06:07.130 --> 06:10.475
We have never given them any special favors. The 
ones who were here were treated just like everyone

06:11.376 --> 06:19.367
else and got grades that were, as far as I know, 
totally non-discriminatory. Some of them are

06:20.512 --> 06:23.775
very good, some of them work so good just like 
anybody else. The fact that you have other

06:25.998 --> 06:36.029
colleges that are all black probably

06:25.998 --> 06:36.029
keeps us from enrolling as many as we might. I'm not 
exactly sure. The only thing I am sure of is there

06:37.310 --> 06:49.523
has been no discrimination and we have been 
perfectly willing, and the fact is we've tried

06:37.310 --> 06:49.523
rather hard to encourage colored people to come. 
jet meetings in various schools down in Houston,

06:49.705 --> 06:55.511
for example, and tried to talk up A&M. One thing, 
there's a lot of competition for not too many

06:56.552 --> 07:03.519
blacks that go to school or college, I guess. When 
you spread it out everywhere, they just didn't

07:03.539 --> 07:06.002
want to go around. Have the salary levels for 
chemical engineers always been as good as they are

07:07.824 --> 07:14.891
today? No, these things go in cycles. The cycle up 
until the 60s was that the chem engineers got

07:18.595 --> 07:23.981
pretty well stomped on. During the 60s up to about 
1970 or so, salaries took a very dramatic zoom.

07:33.411 --> 07:38.356
Actually I think for a while even matched or 
surpassed industrial salaries. Since then

07:39.237 --> 07:48.467
there's been a steady deterioration in salary 
ranking and right now I don't believe I would enter

07:49.527 --> 07:54.895
the teaching of chem engineering if I were a young 
man. I don't see why these young people are staying

07:56.277 --> 07:59.201
with us to be honest about it. Because they can 
make, all of them can make at least ten to fifteen

08:00.523 --> 08:07.013
thousand a year more in industry with 
considerable less effort.

08:11.760 --> 08:18.370
This is a big problem and one that instead of 
anybody really seeming to address, it seems to be

08:11.760 --> 08:18.370
getting progressively worse and worse. The 
salaries look good until you look at industry. The

08:26.165 --> 08:37.443
reason they look good is simply because in the 
inflationary era, all of us tend to think back in

08:26.165 --> 08:37.443
the days of yore when I came here, for example, for 
$6,000 in 53. But as far as I am concerned, my

08:38.424 --> 08:43.412
standard of living has not changed very much. fact 
is, if I still had kids in school and so forth, I

08:46.025 --> 08:53.596
suspect my standard of living has been steady 
since I first came here. I don't believe I have

08:53.616 --> 09:00.005
improved it at all, even though I've moved up to a 
full professorship. What type of job

09:00.025 --> 09:06.996
opportunities do master's degree holders of 
electrical engineering, I mean chemical

09:00.025 --> 09:06.996
engineering? Master's? They usually don't get 
starting salaries that are the very pronounced

09:13.733 --> 09:15.636
above what the B.S. level gets. Oh, the B.S. level 
now will get around 27,000 and the Masters will get

09:20.303 --> 09:25.610
around 30. Maybe, well, yeah about that. Maybe 28 
and a half to 30. The difference though is a Masters

09:34.764 --> 09:38.149
student is better prepared. There hasn't yet been 
a experience system that has been as efficient as a

09:41.223 --> 09:47.289
structured educational program. And we, I think I 
can look around and see the people who went out as

09:47.309 --> 10:02.964
masters after a few years have improved their 
relative standings considerably, simply

09:47.309 --> 10:02.964
because they were more competent. Now, PhDs, I 
just don't know. It's sort of a labor of love to

10:06.248 --> 10:10.572
become a PhD.

10:11.142 --> 10:14.787
My only thought on that is everybody ought to get 
educated as much as he can. If he's got the brain

10:14.867 --> 10:18.171
power and it was given to him, it's not his fault. He 
somehow has an obligation to develop it to

10:18.712 --> 10:23.078
whatever maximum he can.

10:31.248 --> 10:37.116
How do you think the chemical engineering program 
at A&M compares with those at other universities?

10:43.120 --> 10:45.764
Oh, I think we compare very well with others. I'm 
not exactly sure whether it's our department. I'm

10:51.012 --> 10:55.339
more inclined to think it's the kind of students 
that we just somehow seem to attract. I firmly

10:56.241 --> 11:03.492
believe Aggies are a different kind of people than 
go to the usual university type. I've had many

11:05.024 --> 11:11.971
recruiters tell us that if they were only going to 
recruit at one school, A&M would be the first

11:05.024 --> 11:11.971
school they would go to. And I don't think they were 
just trying to flatter me. I believe they were

11:15.114 --> 11:19.038
serious about it. I worry a great deal. I think

11:20.099 --> 11:34.153
we have probably much too much emphasis on, every 
administrator will deny it, but it's a fact of

11:20.099 --> 11:34.153
absolute certainty, publish or perish. And I 
think our educational program is very greatly

11:35.618 --> 11:39.803
harmed. I think it's harmed because we haven't, 
for example, hired anyone with industrial

11:40.604 --> 11:50.375
experience of any magnitude for years. And I 
believe in order to teach, at least undergraduate

11:51.416 --> 12:03.229
engineering, your profs should have a rather 
extensive industrial background.

12:04.762 --> 12:16.780
Actually, if someone were to come in here now with 
an industrial background, I believe it would be

12:04.762 --> 12:16.780
negative as far as his career is concerned, 
although it would be extremely positive as far as

12:04.762 --> 12:16.780
his students are concerned. Because I think he 
would get no credit at all for this type of thing.

12:23.209 --> 12:27.235
There's a lot of pressure placed on back then to 
publish articles. Not so much to publish articles

12:27.255 --> 12:29.959
as to bring in money. bring in a big research grant 
with a lot of overhead and that sort of thing. But to

12:36.953 --> 12:38.977
publish articles, I wouldn't say. If you've got 
much research going at all, it's easy to get enough

12:38.997 --> 12:48.234
papers out to satisfy any reasonable criteria. So 
the big thing is to get an ongoing program that

12:48.254 --> 12:53.263
brings in a lot of quote dollars I kind of resent the 
idea of measuring research in terms of dollars in

12:53.615 --> 13:02.568
the first place, because most of your best 
research probably is dollar-wise pretty skimpy.

13:02.588 --> 13:05.572
Are most of these funds, you're talking about 
government or private interest funds? Almost all

13:06.193 --> 13:07.535
of it is federal. Are these funds, among those that 
are being cut back with the regular

13:08.817 --> 13:16.568
administration money cuts? In our area yet, 
particularly. I think the Reagan administration

13:18.718 --> 13:38.224
is cutting back more in social sciences and

13:18.718 --> 13:38.224
these kind of programs where they hire some guy to 
sit around a Peruvian brothel that I was reading

13:18.718 --> 13:38.224
about in the paper the other day for a year and make 
little notes of the comings and goings of all the

13:18.718 --> 13:38.224
inhabitants. That kind of thing, I think, is 
taking a pretty sharp licking right now. Of

13:44.632 --> 13:46.234
course, as far as I'm concerned, it should. basic 
research and this kind of thing, the kind of thing

13:46.855 --> 13:52.280
we're doing at the moment hasn't suffered too 
badly. And I kind of hope to get rid of the

13:53.340 --> 14:01.447
Department of Energy because I think their 
programs have been principally negative rather

13:53.340 --> 14:01.447
than positive. It'll be supplanted, I hope, with 
something that would be more useful. Why do you

14:05.991 --> 14:09.894
think that his program's been negative? Well, 
let's look at it this way. Every year, the

14:11.176 --> 14:16.440
Department of Energy has spent more money than the 
top income of the top four or five oil companies.

14:19.896 --> 14:26.824
And I don't know of a single thing they've done 
that's worthwhile yet as far as solving the energy

14:19.896 --> 14:26.824
crisis. I think they've inhibited it. If they'd 
just left that money with the oil companies or

14:29.407 --> 14:33.571
somebody else, it would have been better than 
nothing.

14:36.714 --> 14:39.978
What about state legislative funding for 
research? Do you have much of that? We have been

14:41.840 --> 14:46.545
funded with the CAR primarily from this area, not 
heavily. $5,000 a year, $7,000 a year, and that

14:47.538 --> 14:52.405
kind of thing. Most of that work has been, I guess 
you'd say, a labor of love. We just enjoy it and

14:56.049 --> 14:59.855
spend most of my weekends and things like that on 
it. I've got a lot more respect for the Texas

15:02.318 --> 15:06.103
legislature than I do for the national 
legislature.

15:13.222 --> 15:20.353
I'm sure that without the two major research 
projects that you have underway that you wouldn't

15:13.222 --> 15:20.353
have too much time for any other type of research. 
Is that correct?

15:24.099 --> 15:28.706
You don't have much time for any extensive 
research. We have a grant from DOE in conjunction

15:28.766 --> 15:37.339
with the mechanical engineering department to 
study dissociated alcohol into hydrogen and CO2,

15:38.129 --> 15:44.158
for example, as a automotive fuel. This is 
$125,000, something like that.

15:50.487 --> 15:53.211
So we do, we are carrying out other programs. Just 
that particular one is not particularly exciting

15:54.052 --> 16:00.100
because the fact is we think it's kind of stupid. We 
take a good fuel like alcohol at great expense and

16:07.407 --> 16:15.656
In practicality, convert it to hydrogen and CO2, 
which is a questionable value as a fuel. We don't

16:15.676 --> 16:19.921
see much point in it, but we were able to get money in 
that area. We could get money to do what we're

16:19.981 --> 16:27.410
doing, so we do it. You didn't receive your PhD 
until you were over 50. Did you have any regret

16:30.093 --> 16:32.335
about having waited so long? Well, financially, 
it hurt me a great deal. because I didn't get all

16:37.259 --> 16:45.169
those big salary raises that were coming along in 
the 60s because at that time they had to kind of, you

16:37.259 --> 16:45.169
know, they always have limits. You can't get above 
that limit until you've gotten all the criteria

16:46.270 --> 16:51.576
met. One of the criteria was to have an advanced 
degree, a Ph.D. So I have never been able to catch

16:56.442 --> 16:58.365
up. I will always be financially back over what I 
would have had if I had gone ahead and just got my

16:58.565 --> 17:06.895
Ph.D. I first got started on all this,

17:07.634 --> 17:21.013
but at the time it just wasn't practical because it 
looked like it was too much of a sacrifice at any one

17:07.634 --> 17:21.013
time with kids in school and everything. It's just 
hard to quit your job and do this kind of thing. You

17:28.504 --> 17:29.886
finished the coursework in a year. That's 
correct. Because I only had a sabbatical year to

17:31.529 --> 17:33.411
leave. I had to.

17:41.080 --> 17:48.849
Do you have any other thing we need to touch on

17:41.080 --> 17:48.849
before we close? I guess everybody has a pet idea. I 
believe that this university has gotten so big, so

17:50.811 --> 18:04.186
bureaucratic, that it's almost ready to collapse 
at its own weight. For example, we have a new

18:04.206 --> 18:07.830
engineering research building just going up 
across here. If you look at the blueprints, you'll

18:11.600 --> 18:21.412
find that approximately half of that building 
will be occupied by offices, and only half of it

18:11.600 --> 18:21.412
will be research. The rest of it will be used by 
these, quote, tax eaters that we have around. I

18:26.558 --> 18:36.130
think the best thing that could happen with this 
university, if it were all practical, would be to

18:26.558 --> 18:36.130
have a, I'm not even sure how you pronounce the 
word, an ombudsman, I guess it is, could report

18:37.645 --> 18:55.090
directly to the president and carry to him 
suggestions from the lower level of the working

18:37.645 --> 18:55.090
level I guess you'd say of the university and 
preserve anonymity in the process. There's so

18:56.932 --> 19:02.320
many things around here where you fill out four or 
five forms to do something And all the time you're

19:03.059 --> 19:10.447
doing it, you know that the only person that's ever 
going to look at one of them will be some little old

19:03.059 --> 19:10.447
girl somewhere in some office who will chunk it off 
in a certain spot. And it's just make work. There's

19:13.070 --> 19:13.951
too much of it. Much too much of it. I used to teach a, 
I started a stack sampling short course here to

19:16.013 --> 19:25.583
teach people how to sample smoke stacks for 
pollutants. I did this at the urging of the Texas

19:26.904 --> 19:32.070
Air Control Board because they wanted to 
establish standards And measuring these things

19:33.097 --> 19:38.485
is rather difficult, and there were only about 
five or six people in the state that knew how. So we

19:39.186 --> 19:41.589
started this course, which was very, very 
successful. As a matter of fact, we had

19:43.492 --> 19:45.915
international recognition. I was invited to 
Spain twice to give the course. I went to Portugal

19:52.925 --> 19:56.590
and helped them set up their stack sampling 
program. We've had students from all over the

19:58.493 --> 20:01.057
world to the course. It was a very profitable 
venture, made several hundred, well, up to a

20:01.177 --> 20:06.124
hundred and some thousand dollars. But I just got 
harassed so much by, they formed a new thing on here

20:07.005 --> 20:12.152
called the Center for Continuing Education. And 
they had such a harassment, I just quit. I had to

20:17.139 --> 20:22.246
submit budgets, and I had to do all kinds of things. 
And they didn't do me a bit of good. They were just a

20:23.608 --> 20:26.172
stone around my neck, so to heck with it. And so that 
course has gone by the way. Used to offer it every

20:29.614 --> 20:34.687
year, but it stopped now. What was the name of that 
again? Stack Sampling Short Course.

20:41.609 --> 21:03.695
You see the thing is that apparently they need to 
report to the president on how effective a job

20:41.609 --> 21:03.695
they're doing and in order to do it they've got to 
know how many people attend the course and how many

20:41.609 --> 21:03.695
dollars I took in and blah blah blah blah blah and 
then they take a turn around and write to the

20:41.609 --> 21:03.695
president say look at the good job we're doing and 
all they're doing is just causing me problems so I

20:41.609 --> 21:03.695
give up. This continuing education division is a 
as a bureaucratic watchdog, so to speak, over

21:07.259 --> 21:12.486
various departments. Is that what you're saying? 
Yeah. I think there are a lot of good things they

21:14.428 --> 21:19.214
could do, but they haven't done any, as far as I can 
tell. They never helped me any. All they did was

21:20.957 --> 21:22.198
give me a headache. Were they mandated by the 
legislature? No, they were part of the university

21:24.441 --> 21:26.644
program. They decided we ought to have a 
continuing thing. And I think one of the problems

21:28.527 --> 21:33.553
was that there were certain divisions or 
something that were given... I guess you'd say

21:34.748 --> 21:40.375
giving academic credit in this kind of thing, 
which was not coordinated through the

21:34.748 --> 21:40.375
university. I can see a need for that kind of a 
thing. There's a lot of good things they could do.

21:44.000 --> 21:47.204
They just don't seem to respond. For example, my 
biggest problem has been in mailing lists. I could

21:52.390 --> 21:57.777
have used a lot of assistance in developing good 
mailing lists and getting mailings out. The

21:59.279 --> 22:04.165
Association of Former Students, for example, has 
a system where they mail it, stuff the envelopes,

22:04.482 --> 22:06.864
and do the whole bit. And we have to sit around here 
and fold them by hand and all that. But that kind of

22:10.787 --> 22:15.752
practical thing is beyond the Center for 
Continuing Education.

22:20.456 --> 22:23.158
Do you have any regrets about ever coming to work 
here at Asia?

22:26.981 --> 22:33.527
Oh, I had a few when I first came because I took about 
a 50% or 100%, well, 50% cut in salary to come here. I

22:34.148 --> 22:45.298
had a good job at Apache, but after a few years I 
began to realize it didn't make much difference

22:34.148 --> 22:45.298
whether my kids drove around in Cadillacs or 
secondhand Fords. Probably they're better off

22:45.379 --> 22:47.621
with a secondhand Ford anyhow. I guess you'd say I 
got lazy or something. My motives changed. I guess

22:55.248 --> 22:57.670
that's a better sense. The way it turns out, I think 
I have been one of the most lucky of people. For

23:03.015 --> 23:03.936
example, Oh, just a few weeks ago, on a Monday 
morning I was getting out of bed and I got one foot

23:04.962 --> 23:15.900
down on the floor and it all of a sudden hit me that I 
could hardly wait to get to work. And I got to

23:15.920 --> 23:24.974
thinking, I'll bet you there aren't more than 1% of 
the population on Monday morning are so excited

23:15.920 --> 23:24.974
and anxious to get to work that they hardly don't 
want to stop to eat. And if you're in that category,

23:26.016 --> 23:28.480
you've got to be awfully lucky. I enjoy what I'm 
doing. And I guess the main reason that more than

23:32.097 --> 23:39.684
any other one thing, other than the fact that I've 
been able to do a lot of research in areas that I

23:32.097 --> 23:39.684
like, is I just like Aggies. I like my students. 
They're wonderful people. They're fun to be

23:43.548 --> 23:44.348
around. They're stimulating. I don't believe any 
other school quite would fit that mold. Maybe I'm

23:49.733 --> 23:55.258
just prejudiced, but I think we have a special 
breed here that's unusual.

23:57.801 --> 23:59.202
I appreciate you taking the time to talk. There was 
a lot of yakking.
