00:13.143 --> 00:32.324
One of the pioneering efforts in that direction 
has been made by the great physiologist, marine

00:13.143 --> 00:32.324
physiologist, Professor Schollander, here at 
Scripps, who has demonstrated that the most

00:13.143 --> 00:32.324
difficult experiments can be carried out even on 
relatively small ships. And he was the leading

00:32.344 --> 00:42.255
spirit in acquiring the ship Alpha Helix, which is 
a floating laboratory, rather small. goes all

00:42.809 --> 00:55.206
over the world and carries out on the spot 
particularly marine, biochemical, biological

00:42.809 --> 00:55.206
investigations that could not be done back home 
because you need to look at things right then and

00:42.809 --> 00:55.206
there. If you pickle things and bring them back, 
it's just dead stuff. So that has set a fantastic

00:59.572 --> 01:04.679
example in that field. Also in physical 
oceanography and the geological aspects,

01:04.699 --> 01:10.347
there's quite a lot you can do on board. There, I 
think... the United States is somewhat lagging

01:13.049 --> 01:15.631
behind. That aspect is much more stressed by 
nations that have large ships that are

01:16.592 --> 01:31.825
comfortable, have laboratories that can operate 
even when the sea is a little rough, like the USSR.

01:33.027 --> 01:36.850
But an exception from the general rule here is the 
deep-sea drilling. Deep-sea drilling is done

01:36.870 --> 01:41.554
from big platforms, and therefore they have good 
laboratories on board, and much of the important

01:42.040 --> 01:56.358
preliminary work is done on shipboard by 
scientists so that one knows when one comes back

01:42.040 --> 01:56.358
directly what one has, and one can do some planning 
for the next, maybe for the next drill hole from

01:42.040 --> 01:56.358
what you get in the first with some 
sophistication.

01:58.782 --> 02:11.558
Would you, what

01:58.782 --> 02:11.558
would you adjudge to be then the more important 
developments that have occurred in oceanography

01:58.782 --> 02:11.558
over the last, let's say since you began, in terms 
of analyzing data?

02:16.538 --> 02:34.020
Well, as far as analyzing data goes, there are, of 
course, a large number of refined instruments

02:16.538 --> 02:34.020
that have been developed, very elegant 
instrumentation that permits much more accurate

02:16.538 --> 02:34.020
measurements, and for treatment of the data, then 
obvious computer developments. But that is not

02:35.141 --> 02:36.863
the most important. I think the most important is 
ideas and completely new techniques that has

02:39.196 --> 02:43.580
opened up new realms for investigation. And there 
you have again deep sea drilling that's permitted

02:44.101 --> 02:48.845
us to look at the ocean in the third dimension. And 
that makes, I think, the statement wrong that the

02:49.506 --> 02:54.991
exploration of the ocean is over. Exploration, 
the first guess at what the very surface looks like

02:55.852 --> 03:04.300
of the ocean floor is perhaps done in many areas, 
not all. But it's opened up a completely new third

03:04.320 --> 03:06.722
dimension. distribution in depth, the whole 
geological history of the ocean. And there is much

03:10.745 --> 03:11.986
left to do there. So that is one of the 
breakthroughs in new techniques that have opened

03:12.887 --> 03:18.052
up completely new vistas in the field. Other very 
important developments is the deep toe

03:18.753 --> 03:36.270
instrumentation that Professor Spies at this 
institution has developed, where you can look at

03:18.753 --> 03:36.270
the sea floor very closely, and therefore see 
detail and measure things that you could never

03:18.753 --> 03:36.270
even guess at when you try to do it from the surface 
as you did in the past.

03:42.137 --> 03:45.422
Those are some of the most important things. Other 
important tools, of course, are things like

03:47.424 --> 03:54.914
anchored buoys, big buoys that can collect and 
transmit data continually. That is a field where

03:56.756 --> 04:02.764
only the surface has been scratched, and where an 
example of how the lack of measurements at many

04:03.942 --> 04:13.812
points at the same time limits our knowledge is the 
equatorial current system, for example. There

04:13.832 --> 04:23.821
is, as you know, an undercurrent along the equator 
running under the surface about 50 meters depth,

04:13.832 --> 04:23.821
which is fantastically swift. It's as fast as a 
Gulf Stream and carries a larger volume of water

04:25.963 --> 04:30.648
than the Gulf Stream. It's one of the most 
important flows water in the world. That plays a

04:36.232 --> 04:41.037
crucial role for the whole productivity of the 
equator. That is the basis for the enormous

04:41.097 --> 04:46.362
fisheries potential and lots of ramifications. 
The whole mechanism, the dynamics of that system

04:47.503 --> 05:01.236
is very little known, practically unknown, and 
not very well understood, mainly due to the fact

04:47.503 --> 05:01.236
that there have never been observations at 
sufficient number of points at the same time that

05:02.802 --> 05:09.409
permit you to know where the thing is. Nobody knows 
if it's snaking through the ocean, if it separates

05:10.290 --> 05:22.702
into blobs, if it undulates like a snake up and 
down, what the periodicity is of these motions and

05:10.290 --> 05:22.702
what is the dynamics of the whole system. To solve 
such a problem you have to have either something

05:23.623 --> 05:31.071
like a dozen ships operating at the same time or a 
large number of buoys or some similar things.

05:42.649 --> 06:00.788
So that is just an example of how synoptic 
measurements carried out with measurements with

05:42.649 --> 06:00.788
a large number of points at the same time for the 
solution of some of the major problems in the ocean

05:42.649 --> 06:00.788
have yet to be done in the future. What do you see for 
your future? Oh, I'm an existentialist, as I told

06:04.942 --> 06:08.005
you. So I'm doing today what I see as the most 
important things, and I have very little idea

06:08.025 --> 06:15.753
where that will lead me tomorrow. But I'm almost 
dreaming of coming back sometime for a third take

06:16.774 --> 06:28.345
on the problems, again, associated with the 
equatorial very exciting equatorial

06:29.135 --> 06:57.994
circulation and its effects on sedimentation and 
on the record in the past because it's one of the

06:29.135 --> 06:57.994
most spectacular global mechanisms where the 
pulse of the Earth essentially is recorded and

06:29.135 --> 06:57.994
where you can get an integrated picture of what 
happened to the Earth as a planet over a very long

06:29.135 --> 06:57.994
time and understand how the climatic mechanisms 
of the Earth So that is, in oceanography, one of the

06:58.666 --> 07:03.933
most interesting things I look forward to. 
Another one that we are working on right now, which

07:03.973 --> 07:19.773
has somewhat of a social implications, is the 
resources of the ocean, the mineral resources of

07:03.973 --> 07:19.773
the ocean, and their importance for the world, the 
future world. That was something I wanted to ask

07:19.793 --> 07:21.595
you about. I was going to ask you in terms of what you 
thought your major accomplishment was thus far.

07:25.981 --> 07:27.863
What is the mineral potential of the ocean? Do you 
answer the guess? Well, there are several

07:29.675 --> 07:32.519
different aspects that are interesting. There 
are questions of phosphates, for example,

07:32.539 --> 07:37.186
deposited in the relative nearshore area. But one 
of the major potential resources discussed

07:38.829 --> 07:55.453
today, which is the focus of our interest, also 
from a scientific point of view, is the huge

07:38.829 --> 07:55.453
deposits of copper-nickel ore, copper-nickel 
incorporated in the normally more innocuous

07:56.345 --> 08:07.540
manganese nodules in a specific narrow zone 
parallel to the equator, essentially, in the

07:56.345 --> 08:07.540
Pacific, and perhaps also in the Indian Ocean. An 
ore that, just in one stroke, has doubled the

08:09.422 --> 08:14.589
world's known resources of copper and nickel. And 
one thing that interests us much, too, is that

08:16.011 --> 08:20.496
associated problems. Everybody realizes, from a 
resource point of view, that this is important.

08:24.081 --> 08:25.643
The challenge to me lies in In other associated 
uses of the deposits that these nodules lie in,

08:26.197 --> 08:34.748
they have very interesting characteristics. And 
one of the things we have been playing with is to

08:34.768 --> 08:54.194
investigate

08:34.768 --> 08:54.194
or to develop an interesting type of ceramic from 
this sediment, which is extremely lightweight,

08:34.768 --> 08:54.194
porous, highly insulating, and relatively high 
flexure strength. So that is interesting.

08:55.728 --> 09:02.855
building material for earthquake-proof 
buildings with very high thermal insulation and

08:55.728 --> 09:02.855
energy conservation properties. I don't know if 
it will ever work out practically. You never know

09:06.679 --> 09:21.094
that with the early developments, but that's a 
type of interesting secondary approach to new

09:06.679 --> 09:21.094
mineral resources on the sea floor.

09:22.053 --> 09:33.666
A sizable number of critics have maintained that 
the extraction of minerals from the ocean will be

09:22.053 --> 09:33.666
so expensive that this sort of resource is 
limited. I take it you disagree with that? Well, I

09:35.889 --> 09:48.803
wouldn't know because I'm not an economist, I'm 
not an engineer, and it's staggering for me to

09:35.889 --> 09:48.803
think of the difficulties in designing tools for 
retrieval of these ores at the necessary rate of

09:49.154 --> 09:53.378
something like a couple of million tons per year 
for each unit involved. But I think the best

09:55.159 --> 10:19.060
testimony to the practical possibilities is that 
all of the major

09:55.159 --> 10:19.060
mining companies in the world essentially are 
involved in one of the major consortia that have

09:55.159 --> 10:19.060
been formed to explore these possibilities, and 
that they who are experts in the field actual

10:19.377 --> 10:29.469
practical mining, judge the possibilities good 
enough so that they have invested many millions of

10:19.377 --> 10:29.469
dollars into this and are continuing to do it at an 
increased rate. I think when I talk to these

10:30.471 --> 10:46.971
people, my friends among them, it is clear that the 
more conservative among them think that it might

10:30.471 --> 10:46.971
be touch and go, but that it's promising enough to 
pursue for sure at the present time.

10:49.837 --> 10:57.024
I take it then that you feel as if your career will 
now, again to use that awful word, drift back into

10:49.837 --> 10:57.024
the ocean rather than float back out to space. No, I 
don't think so. It will remain in the ocean as it

10:58.925 --> 11:05.732
always has been and without being limited to that. 
So I foresee to divide my time between problems in

11:07.153 --> 11:17.903
the ocean, in the solar system as a whole, also in 
more fundamental questions in material science,

11:18.507 --> 11:24.873
which interests me very much. And exactly in terms 
of material science? Well, again, there I want to

11:29.678 --> 11:47.535
learn and understand better the fundamental 
properties of the

11:29.678 --> 11:47.535
materials that we study and use on the ocean floor. 
and that we see forming in space. These are very

11:52.054 --> 12:02.469
complex processes in nature, and you have to look 
at the underlying more simple processes in the

11:52.054 --> 12:02.469
laboratory in order to understand them, and the 
theory that is developed for more simple things.

12:03.049 --> 12:13.284
So this combination of three fields, I think, is, 
to my mind, an appealing and productive one. I just

12:13.304 --> 12:15.447
have one more question about in terms of three 
fields. Do you think it will be possible in

12:16.624 --> 12:31.317
scientific training in the future for a scientist 
to switch or to move from field to field, let's say,

12:16.624 --> 12:31.317
as you've done, Roger Revelle's done, Isaac's 
done? Do you think that will become less possible?

12:34.520 --> 12:35.341
I don't think so. No, I think if you acquire a good 
fundamental training, the characteristic of a

12:35.461 --> 12:45.130
good fundamental training is that it gives you the 
tools to both move in in different fields of

12:46.578 --> 13:15.724
science and also to adapt to all the developments 
that take place in science unless you have such a

12:46.578 --> 13:15.724
training and insight then you are lost after 15 
years when developers have run away from you so you

12:46.578 --> 13:15.724
both must keep in touch both in time and in space 
with the developments so you see the role will

12:46.578 --> 13:15.724
continues as the scientist is journalist as a 
Generalist with a broad base sharpened to a point.

13:20.877 --> 13:31.148
Because it's dangerous if you

13:20.877 --> 13:31.148
are too general, then it's dangerous you could 
become a dilettante. You have to have some things

13:31.909 --> 13:36.813
that you really are better in than anybody else.
