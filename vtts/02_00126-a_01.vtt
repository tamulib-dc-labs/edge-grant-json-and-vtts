00:02.377 --> 00:14.424
September 27, in the lobby of the

00:02.377 --> 00:14.424
Kleberg Center, getting ready to interview Dean 
of Agriculture, Emeritus Harry Kunkel. Harry,

00:16.108 --> 00:17.230
test your mic.

00:31.992 --> 00:49.656
Harry, to introduce a future reader of the 
transcription or listener to the tape, to

00:31.992 --> 00:49.656
introduce them to you, would you describe your 
growing up years and your experience before you

00:31.992 --> 00:49.656
came to A&M to enroll as a student? Where did you 
grow up and what did you do and what was your family

00:50.137 --> 00:54.363
doing and so forth? I grew up about four miles 
outside of the city of Alney. just across the

01:01.473 --> 01:06.158
county line in Archer County, Texas.

01:12.244 --> 01:14.906
It was a farm, a 252 acre farm. The family did own 
another 1100 and some acres near

01:15.607 --> 01:30.822
Westover, Texas.

01:33.940 --> 01:36.825
I was one of two children. My brother was some nine 
years younger than me, and therefore I was in

01:36.905 --> 01:52.972
school and away, essentially older than he at the 
time that he came along. I did not start school

01:54.094 --> 01:57.940
until I was seven years old. And the school that I 
went to was a church school, a private school,

01:59.590 --> 02:09.520
approximately one and a half miles away from our 
home. It was a Lutheran school. And I went into that

02:13.804 --> 02:23.213
Lutheran school all the way through the eighth 
grade, which then was the first year of high

02:13.804 --> 02:23.213
school.

02:23.474 --> 02:26.557
Did you, was the instruction in English or German? 
The instruction was in English. but there were of

02:29.425 --> 02:33.570
course German reading exercises and the like. It 
was not as much bilingual as one might have

02:34.411 --> 02:38.135
thought. My home was probably more bilingual. My 
grandfather and grandmother lived with us during

02:41.579 --> 02:45.324
the early period of life.

02:49.288 --> 02:56.817
I was probably a pretty shy kind of a person at that 
point in time. although I found that

02:57.404 --> 03:20.728
I was able to, I guess, get along with the grades all 
right, because I went through the first grade with

02:57.404 --> 03:20.728
a beloved teacher, Miss Johanna Schwaus, and 
don't ask me how the bad friend spelled her name.

03:21.822 --> 03:23.564
Then other teachers came. These were male 
teachers that were usually in Divinity School and

03:23.604 --> 03:36.677
stepped out a year in order to teach as sort of an 
internship type of activity. What were the money

03:37.598 --> 03:40.100
crops on the Kunkel farm? The money crops on the 
Kunkel farm were basically

03:40.300 --> 03:50.310
wheat,

03:50.830 --> 03:52.813
There was no cotton particularly. The cotton 
picking apparently went by the wayside early in my

03:52.833 --> 03:59.963
life because of the labor and things of the sort. It 
was principally wheat and hay and cattle. The

04:03.989 --> 04:12.862
money crops, of course, were butter and eggs and 
some chickens. And when you all went to town, it was

04:14.804 --> 04:18.810
to Olney? When we went to town, it was to Olney. We 
generally went on Saturdays because Saturday was

04:21.391 --> 04:27.020
the afternoon and everybody came into Saturday. 
That's when I went into the Tencent movie, usually

04:27.340 --> 04:33.109
in the afternoon while folks sat out. On the 
evenings, the people would park along the main

04:34.191 --> 04:45.528
street and watch the people as they moved back and 
forth and made friends and this kind of a thing.

04:46.230 --> 04:49.795
Sunday was probably the biggest social activity 
that we went to. Oftentimes we would end up being

04:50.129 --> 04:56.878
invited on the spur of the moment to somebody's 
home and having dinner. That's the Sunday meal.

05:00.282 --> 05:06.510
And then would you go back to church after that long 
dinner, or did you go home then? We went home after

05:06.550 --> 05:07.831
that. Was there a Sunday evening service? 
Sometimes there was a Sunday evening service, and

05:09.714 --> 05:14.420
we would go to that. This was Missouri Synod 
Lutheran? This was Missouri Synod Lutheran. So

05:18.513 --> 05:21.437
conservative in its theology? Conservative, 
very conservative in its theology. How long had

05:25.602 --> 05:27.224
your family lived out there? My family moved back 
there before, I'm not quite sure how long. It was

05:35.595 --> 05:36.836
before the 1900s. They

05:36.996 --> 05:41.422
lived at this place. They bought it in the latter 
part of the 19th century. Right, and at Olney High

05:47.167 --> 05:52.311
School, how many were in your graduating class? Do 
you remember? There were about 80 in my graduating

05:53.793 --> 05:58.096
class, 83 in the graduating class. Let me tell you 
about my work. I went all the way through high

05:59.438 --> 06:07.705
school, and my first year of high school, I still 
stayed out at this private school. I was the only

06:08.065 --> 06:09.286
one in class. And of course, it had to be a tutorial 
type of activity up to that particular point. I

06:17.491 --> 06:21.515
went only to high school for two and a half years. I 
transferred my grades without any difficulty. I

06:27.362 --> 06:32.167
started moving ahead, taking courses, and had no 
particular problems. But along the way, we had

06:33.068 --> 06:43.600
become members of a 4-H club, and that 4-H club

06:46.803 --> 06:52.670
I had calves and whatever, chickens and a few other 
things.

06:55.313 --> 07:09.409
It was a 4-H club that perhaps was more of a creative 
or more of an effect, had an effect on my life and my

06:55.313 --> 07:09.409
future than anything else because the church had 
no particular effect. I had wanted to be a minister

07:09.429 --> 07:15.055
when I was young, but I decided something earlier 
wouldn't be there. It was in the 4-H club

07:15.862 --> 07:22.194
situations and I began to show calves. I grew a crop 
of grain sorghum which was new and it was on judging

07:23.977 --> 07:34.798
teams the first year. I was 14 years old, or 13 years 
old. I was 14 years old. I was on the

07:40.463 --> 07:46.569
county meat identification camp. We came here for 
the 4-H round of Farmers Roundup at that

07:46.949 --> 07:53.215
particular point in time. So your first visit to 
College Station? Was in association with 4-H

07:56.779 --> 07:59.882
work. And about your first year at Olney? High 
school? About the first year at Alney High School.

08:08.273 --> 08:10.275
What year would that be then, if you were 14? That 
would have been 1937. Do

08:13.779 --> 08:21.348
you remember your impression of A&M at that time? 
My impression of A&M was a very solid impression,

08:21.368 --> 08:30.938
and probably that was the reason why I said I was 
going to come here and be a student here. At any

08:30.958 --> 08:33.321
rate, team from our county, one state, and then we 
were invited to the Chicago, to the National 4-H

08:33.757 --> 08:43.428
Conference. Oh my goodness. And did our judging 
there, and we were somewhere down the line, about

08:44.529 --> 08:50.956
seventh or eighth in among the states. I went next 
year and decided I couldn't go back in this, so I

08:52.497 --> 09:01.367
went to the poultry judging team, and one state. 
and went to Chicago once again on a judging team,

09:03.068 --> 09:21.753
and made a considerable number of friends, 
particularly at that point in time, who turned out

09:03.068 --> 09:21.753
to be friends and people who I knew at Texas A&M 
University. Who were some of those A&M? Oh, names

09:25.337 --> 09:27.480
fail me. These were faculty? No. Oh, students. Oh, 
I see, I see. They were students.

09:36.188 --> 09:44.900
In your family, was there any particular time when 
you can recall it was decided you were going to go to

09:36.188 --> 09:44.900
college?

09:47.544 --> 09:49.326
Or had your parents had that? I don't really know 
whether it was a particular time. I think I grew up

09:51.970 --> 09:57.317
with the idea that I was going to college no matter 
what. That was expected of me at the very outset.

10:01.642 --> 10:02.783
But your parents had not. No, my parents' mother 
went through four years of school, and of course

10:03.484 --> 10:15.314
learned to read in a private school. My dad went to 
public school,

10:15.334 --> 10:30.687
and then he later on, he came to Blinn College down 
in Brenham, and did some high school work at Blinn.

10:37.562 --> 10:37.822
All right. When did you begin to make formal 
contact with A&M about application and what was

10:39.324 --> 10:50.897
the process where you applied and were admitted? 
Do you remember? You got a catalog and you got the

10:52.098 --> 10:59.526
application blank and you sent it in and somewhere 
before September 1939,

11:01.835 --> 11:06.863
You didn't come for any kind of summer orientation 
or anything like that? No, there was no such thing

11:06.883 --> 11:09.427
as a summer orientation. The only thing is that I 
knew the campus somewhat in the summer of 1939.

11:17.140 --> 11:26.635
They had changed the format of the program and they 
asked several of us to chair certain programs.

11:27.797 --> 11:28.298
4-H. No, these were programs, presentations at 
the 4-H Roundup, you see, or at the Farmer's

11:29.527 --> 11:41.041
Roundup, Farmer's Roundup as it was called. And at 
the 4-H, it's 4-H Roundup now, it was 4-H with the

11:42.162 --> 11:49.350
Farmer's Roundup at that point. That was probably 
my first contact with anyone of any real

11:50.572 --> 11:57.660
consequence. at Texas A&M University because I 
was chairing a program put on by the College of

11:57.927 --> 12:04.933
Engineering. And so I went to see and visit Mr. 
Gilchrist. I became acquainted with him, and he

12:12.059 --> 12:15.683
was actually the first person. It's interesting 
that the first person I knew was the dean of

12:16.263 --> 12:25.251
engineering rather than the... Can you describe 
your impression of him? Well, I was impressed.

12:29.062 --> 12:30.484
Obviously, he was the dean. I was not taken back by 
him because he had a very outgoing personality at

12:32.326 --> 12:41.537
that point in time. Describe him physically. What 
did he look like? He seemed to be a large man. That's

12:46.222 --> 12:48.605
about all I can remember of him. But was pleasant 
with a student, a prospective student? He was

12:52.270 --> 12:53.171
pleasant with me. I can't say anything else. Now, 
on these visits to A&M, before you came to enroll,

12:57.023 --> 13:02.468
you came on the train or how? Automobile. Oh, an 
automobile. Okay. About how long did it take then

13:06.111 --> 13:09.094
to drive from Alneta? I would say, oh, on the order 
of eight hours or something like that. So a long

13:14.199 --> 13:15.019
day. It was a long day, yeah. All right. Now, when 
you came as a student, you're coming to enroll, how

13:18.222 --> 13:23.807
did you come? Who brought you? What did you bring? 
My parents brought me. And then left me. Left me at

13:30.597 --> 13:34.882
my quarters at that particular point in time. What 
kind of vehicle did you all have then? We had

13:37.284 --> 13:39.567
Chevrolets. We bought a Chevrolet either every 
year or every other year. So y'all... The cost was,

13:46.554 --> 13:51.760
oh, on the order of $400 a year. But y'all were doing 
better than most Texas farmers then. We had some

13:55.844 --> 13:56.545
oil. Oh really? We had some oil and this is probably 
what allowed us to have such things as during the

13:58.329 --> 14:11.566
early period of time we built a new house during my 
years, a rock house. We had electricity

14:13.388 --> 14:23.781
by a 32-volt generator with a set of batteries. You 
always have to buy the 32-volt appliances. They

14:28.755 --> 14:31.338
weren't always available. Did you have a 
telephone on the farm? We did not have a telephone.

14:35.685 --> 14:37.207
How near was it to a telephone? Okay, you went to 
town. What did you, if you can, describe what you

14:41.113 --> 14:51.067
brought with you when you came to enroll? What 
belongings did you bring? I suspect I brought, I

14:53.815 --> 15:11.012
recall I brought a minimum amount of belongings 
because we were all going to be in uniform and there

14:53.815 --> 15:11.012
was a certain amount of uniform that was issued and 
then I went back to Waldrop's over here at the North

14:53.815 --> 15:11.012
Gate. I met Mr. Waldrop and he took me in and mother 
said that if he needs anything I give it to him.

15:21.237 --> 15:24.942
We'll pay for it, help him out. And essentially 
bought the uniform and it was that. There was a few

15:30.070 --> 15:31.812
things like a sweater. We were kind of raunchy 
looking for cool work at that point. And where did

15:37.220 --> 15:41.066
you live that first year? I lived in Russell Hall.

15:47.135 --> 15:48.156
Russell Hall. It's a project house. Oh, okay. The 
very first project house that was built. It's off

15:56.696 --> 15:59.039
campus, as a matter of fact. Where was it located? 
It's on the south gate over here, just off, I don't

16:01.983 --> 16:13.039
recall the street. I recall where...

16:21.278 --> 16:29.929
Following that period of time, there were some 
drugstore being built and things of the sort.

16:29.949 --> 16:33.254
How long had it been a project house? I really don't 
know. It was certainly there. Now, after that,

16:36.197 --> 16:45.249
using that as a pattern, they had built quite a 
series, quite a series of project houses on

16:36.197 --> 16:45.249
campus. And those were already, were they already 
there at that time? But yours was the first one.

16:53.939 --> 16:54.700
That was the first one. Describe the routine of the 
house. How many were there?

17:01.787 --> 17:04.150
There were, I'd say, about 20 students.

17:06.913 --> 17:08.134
This was Washington County. And how did you 
qualify? Well, I had lots of relatives in Redham. I

17:15.862 --> 17:18.825
knew some people that knew some people apparently 
was able to make application and be accepted by the

17:19.227 --> 17:27.339
Washington County group. And so most of them were 
Washington County boys. Most of them were

17:32.146 --> 17:33.368
Washington County. There were three or four 
others or five others that were not. And all of you

17:37.854 --> 17:40.137
were in the Corps. All of us were in the Corps. As a 
matter of fact, Corps life... extended out to the

17:48.573 --> 17:58.805
project houses in a way, in an incomplete way, and 
I'll tell you why I say that in a minute.

18:01.227 --> 18:13.922
The project house was essentially handled by a

18:01.227 --> 18:13.922
lady who had been selected who was a And she had some 
people to help with keeping the house, but we, of

18:14.780 --> 18:22.811
course, had to clean our rooms. We had inspections 
by the military. We were hazed. Were the hazers

18:28.678 --> 18:31.542
from within the house? They were within the house, 
yes. We had paddles and other things that were

18:35.467 --> 18:39.152
good. We were able to stand it. There wasn't 
particularly any protection. Did you all fall out

18:45.290 --> 18:48.877
on the grass outside the house? No, it was all on the 
second floor. Oh, okay. In the hallways. As far as

18:56.331 --> 19:02.964
you know, the house had been built by Washington 
County people and or money? It was either built or

19:04.247 --> 19:07.112
bought by Washington County. Describe your room, 
who was in it, and what was in it. Well, I had two

19:14.450 --> 19:21.097
roommates, one of which had come down with me by the 
name of Cole. He didn't blast very long. He left. He

19:25.641 --> 19:29.365
dropped out of A&M and went to Columbia, Texas 
Tech. I was a little disappointed in it. And I had

19:31.427 --> 19:35.631
another roommate by the name of Harry K. Lisser 
from Chapel Hill. And I think we became friends.

19:39.718 --> 19:40.900
He's now passed on. Were most of these youngsters 
Germanic in their ancestry? No. No. No, as a matter

19:48.910 --> 19:51.654
of fact, most of them were not.

19:54.477 --> 20:02.287
The Germanic people, I think, in Washington 
County and most of them, really, my family was over

19:54.477 --> 20:02.287
in Austin County. And they were not, at that point 
in time, college goers. I see. I see. So you found

20:07.943 --> 20:17.633
that most of that, I'd say the group, they had names 
like Alsabrook and so on. All right. And the lady

20:17.994 --> 20:24.320
who kind of ran the house, how did she come, who 
selected her? Well, that was something that was

20:25.381 --> 20:28.645
done in association. Obviously, there had been 
people that were sort of sponsoring the project

20:28.665 --> 20:36.533
house and people associated with the project 
house. And she was selected. She was a native of

20:39.275 --> 20:46.525
Chapel Hill, which is in Washington.

20:46.545 --> 20:48.407
And of course, it was closed during the 
summertime. Suddenly, during the regular

20:49.829 --> 20:55.657
section, the project house was open. Did she, was 
she the kind of master sergeant of things in terms

20:55.677 --> 21:04.408
of making? Not really, no. She was more of a... 
person

21:06.837 --> 21:15.687
that you could talk to, listen to, but generally 
she was just a mother. And did she do the cooking?

21:18.310 --> 21:20.153
She did the cooking. Did y'all all, describe the 
meal routine. The meal routine is that we all came

21:23.336 --> 21:31.005
down at a meal and had it for breakfast and lunch and 
evening meal. I guess we called it supper. And they

21:35.440 --> 21:40.825
were all full meals, family style? Family style 
meals, yeah. What were some of the foods that you

21:43.168 --> 21:46.491
remember that were particularly good? I am not 
sure I remember any that were particularly good at

21:46.992 --> 21:51.997
all. Was it similar to what you remember at home? I 
remember at home fried chicken and occasionally

21:54.419 --> 22:04.890
fried steak, thin battered round steak that had 
been beaten and battered. Now, did you and your

22:06.271 --> 22:17.322
fellow residents of that house, did you all pay 
cash or did you pay partly in kind? I think, well, we

22:19.725 --> 22:21.106
paid cash. I paid cash at least. Do you remember 
what the cost was? It was on the order of $23 a month.

22:28.153 --> 22:30.956
Okay. Who did the washing? We didn't do washing 
there. We took our clothes to the laundry. Okay. We

22:41.994 --> 22:45.219
took our clothes to the laundry. All right. When 
did you and your fellow residents participate in

22:45.980 --> 22:56.336
the routine of the entire campus in terms of core 
activities and so forth? Well, there was a drill

22:56.356 --> 23:00.763
once a week. And that's when we joined the 
organization in which we were assigned to. I was

23:08.347 --> 23:17.657
assigned to Sea Battery Field Artillery, a 
horse-drawn unit.

23:17.677 --> 23:19.799
I was a member of that organization. I was never 
hazed by them, but I was a member of that

23:20.059 --> 23:23.844
organization. And I met them on one day a week. Did 
it have a nickname, that outfit? The nicknames

23:32.232 --> 23:37.497
seem to have arrived in the 50s. Were you all ever 
teased about kind of being outside the real core

23:38.858 --> 23:45.004
activity? Were you fully accepted? I don't recall 
that we were teased. We were not. I don't know that

23:50.970 --> 23:53.293
we were also fully accepted. What can you do? We 
were meeting, and you had assignments and things

23:54.233 --> 23:57.977
of a sort. Once a week, two hours at best. You did 
meet, you did know some of the students, but

24:01.460 --> 24:08.128
you knew some of your fellow freshmen. And, of 
course, you knew the CO and the first sergeant. But

24:13.035 --> 24:16.279
you had students at that house from all four 
grades. All four levels, freshmen, sophomores,

24:17.340 --> 24:21.045
juniors, seniors. And you wore your uniforms just 
like everyone else. We wore our uniforms just like

24:24.349 --> 24:26.231
everybody else. We had the same requirements of 
wearing the uniforms that everybody did.

24:31.598 --> 24:38.688
Describe as well as you can a typical class day, 
Monday through Friday. Now, I know you had

24:39.388 --> 24:42.753
half-day classes on Saturday, but let's do a full 
day. What time did you get up, and what happened

24:43.194 --> 24:45.256
when? Well, we got up, I guess, about 6 o'clock or 
6.30. I don't recall. At least I was able to get up.

24:51.865 --> 24:57.172
There was a call in the house to get everybody up for 
breakfast. And then we went. If we didn't have

24:59.456 --> 25:01.318
anything to do, we were other than clean up our 
room, that's what we did. Otherwise we went to the

25:03.716 --> 25:06.581
rooms and studied. There was no real area at that 
particular point in that project house where you

25:06.641 --> 25:15.555
have a common place.

25:18.359 --> 25:23.888
And

25:18.359 --> 25:23.888
then you took off and walked to class. And whatever 
class that you have, it took 18 hours or So that

25:29.227 --> 25:36.053
meant essentially six classes, six different 
courses that you were taking. Then in the

25:38.335 --> 25:42.458
afternoons, when you didn't have any classes, 
where did you? Well, we had classes in the

25:43.019 --> 25:46.082
afternoon because we had laboratories. Out of a 
lot of the classes that we had, we had laboratory

25:47.303 --> 25:50.686
classes. At that time, the School of Agriculture 
courses, curricula, were agriculture

25:58.657 --> 26:01.801
curriculum. And the first year, essentially, you 
went through a round robin situation. You took a

26:05.065 --> 26:12.814
course in agronomy, you took a course in 
agricultural economics, which turned out to be

26:05.065 --> 26:12.814
geography, agricultural geography. You took a 
course in animal science, husbandry. You took a

26:15.437 --> 26:18.941
course in ag engineering. You took all in poultry 
science. I guess I didn't take one in poultry, but I

26:22.325 --> 26:24.968
did take one in dairy. So all ag majors were 
introduced to a fairly broad scope.

26:36.671 --> 26:41.819
And there was no such thing as credit by 
examination or anything like that then, was

26:36.671 --> 26:41.819
there? Where you could get some, I'd never heard of 
it. The only thing that you had, if you made a

26:44.723 --> 26:51.653
certain amount of grades level, you were exempt 
from the final exam. Mm-hmm. And if you had any

26:53.146 --> 27:01.434
spare time when you didn't have a class or a lab, 
where did you spend that time? In the library.

27:07.899 --> 27:17.608
I'm smiling because I've heard that from a number, 
and I've heard that a few sometimes found a quiet

27:07.899 --> 27:17.608
corner where they might be able to take a nap. Well, 
I didn't do that. I found... the music room.

27:26.574 --> 27:28.195
Now this is Cushing Library. Cushing Library. I 
found the music room and checked out the records.

27:33.980 --> 27:36.943
And I don't know how many times I listened to Aida.

27:42.348 --> 27:50.895
Now I assume at the project house that there wasn't 
much loud radio played at night because there

27:51.922 --> 27:57.908
would be others studying. Now, back to the house 
physically. If there were 20 young men there,

28:02.873 --> 28:10.921
describe the toilet and shower facilities in that 
project house. There was a toilet and shower

28:11.041 --> 28:13.863
facility on each floor. Okay. About how many could 
shower at the same time in one of those? But it

28:22.077 --> 28:23.399
wasn't a single shower. It wasn't a single shower. 
Did you all play... It was a community shower. But

28:30.588 --> 28:33.511
you farm boys were not intimidated by that, I'm 
assuming. No, it was a community shower. We went

28:34.753 --> 28:35.354
in. Were most of your fellow residents boys from 
the country?

28:44.005 --> 28:46.648
No, some were from Brenham, if you call that 
country. No. Chapel Hill. Okay.

28:52.469 --> 28:56.876
I was as much from the country as anybody, I guess. 
Okay. Were there any rituals at mealtime about the

28:59.060 --> 29:09.036
way the food was passed around or who ate first? You 
had a usual freshman type of ritual, but you had to

29:09.056 --> 29:15.346
pass it on. Of course, the language that was there 
It came from the campus?

29:26.603 --> 29:28.284
It came from the campus. I've heard a number of 
stories that sometimes young freshmen went home

29:28.324 --> 29:40.395
at Thanksgiving or Christmas and forgot and used 
some of their slang and made their mothers. Did

29:40.415 --> 29:42.117
that happen to you? I don't think so. I at least 
don't recall any horror along that particular

29:45.099 --> 29:49.223
line. In terms of family relations, about how 
often did you write a letter home and or get a letter

29:49.844 --> 30:01.458
back from home? I guess

30:01.478 --> 30:06.885
two or three times a week. And do you remember your 
mother sending you any cookies or candy? No, she

30:12.552 --> 30:17.438
came to visit me one time and...

30:20.776 --> 30:21.557
That freshman year? That freshman year, in the 
fall. And then they came and picked me up. We had

30:27.242 --> 30:39.895
friends, people living in Holly, who were in 
school here, and I knew them, and I used to ride

30:27.242 --> 30:39.895
home, ride back, and occasionally just plain old 
hitchhiking. Describe Aggie hitchhiking as you

30:39.915 --> 30:42.697
remember it. Well, the point at which hitchhiking 
started essentially was downtown Bryan. and or

30:49.801 --> 30:55.671
out in front of the gate going.

30:59.317 --> 31:11.978
This, there was everybody had a particular place 
and when you came there you set your bag in order and

30:59.317 --> 31:11.978
you sort of sat and waited till somebody, somebody 
did the thumbing when you finally got down to you or

31:14.472 --> 31:21.958
somebody going to some place you wanted to where 
they wanted, there was a special reason that you

31:14.472 --> 31:21.958
could jump the crowd. You did it, but you didn't do 
it on it. It was strictly with...

31:24.320 --> 31:33.968
Class rank and core rank had no... They had no time 
to do it. It was when you arrived. Did you ever have

31:37.451 --> 31:44.057
any negative hitchhiking experience on somebody 
gave you a ride that
