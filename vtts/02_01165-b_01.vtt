00:10.223 --> 00:12.966
Okay, let's start. This is Ron Shorn on March 26, 
1994, interviewing Andrew T. Young. So, Andy, for

00:18.794 --> 00:24.100
the record, what's your name and the date and place 
of birth? Andrew T. Young. I was born in Canton,

00:25.141 --> 00:29.207
Ohio, April 4, 1935. How did you get interested in 
astronomy? interested in astronomy was when I was

00:35.536 --> 00:43.866
nine years old, there was a night school course on 
astronomy given at the local high school. And my

00:44.187 --> 00:48.432
parents decided to go, but they couldn't find a 
babysitter. So they dragged me along and told me to

00:49.253 --> 00:52.677
sit in the back and keep quiet. And I was absolutely 
fascinated with what went on. The course was

00:56.522 --> 01:04.952
taught by Oscar Lee Gustheimer, who was a retired 
professor of astronomy from Baldwin Wallace

00:56.522 --> 01:04.952
College in Berea, Ohio. And I was absolutely sold 
on astronomy by Professor Gustheimer. And from

01:12.696 --> 01:16.541
that day on, I intended to become an astronomer. So 
what about your schooling? I went to school in

01:20.946 --> 01:27.734
Massillon, Ohio, which is where I grew up.

01:28.535 --> 01:35.884
Never finished high school, but went into college 
at Oberlin College on a Ford Foundation

01:28.535 --> 01:35.884
scholarship. Graduated from Oberlin in 1955 with 
a bachelor's degree and went to Harvard for

01:36.607 --> 01:42.206
graduate school. I got my PhD in 61 or 62, I never can 
remember which. Okay, what did you get your Ph.D.

01:48.385 --> 01:50.187
in? Astronomy. What did you do with your thesis? It 
was called Stellar Kinematics and Spiral Arms,

01:53.551 --> 02:04.002
and I explained the vertex deviation of the 
velocity ellipsoid by basically a selection

01:53.551 --> 02:04.002
effect. If you form stars in spiral arms in 
restricted regions of the galaxy, then only stars

02:04.042 --> 02:12.992
with particular orbits pass through the solar 
neighborhood and get observed. So the younger

02:13.175 --> 02:21.963
stars are selectively a subsample of a complete 
velocity ellipsoidy, kind of a mutilated

02:13.175 --> 02:21.963
velocity distribution. Did that hold up? Gee, I 
don't know. Nobody has used it in years. All right.

02:28.408 --> 02:31.131
Obviously, that doesn't have very much 
connection with planetary astronomy. No, it

02:31.151 --> 02:32.172
certainly doesn't. How did you get interested in 
planetary astronomy? Well, I had a small

02:34.694 --> 02:36.476
telescope. Actually, my father bought a 
skyscope, which was a three and a half inch

02:36.496 --> 02:41.460
reflector telescope. as a result of this night 
school course.

02:49.653 --> 02:54.561
I actually made an 8-inch telescope of my own while 
I was in high school. Planets were something you

02:55.763 --> 03:00.732
could look at, so I had some interest in planets, as 
most amateur astronomers do. When I got to Harvard

03:01.015 --> 03:15.513
as a graduate student, I guess the thing that kind 
of aimed me in that direction was that Quipple

03:01.015 --> 03:15.513
asked me to do a research report on planetary 
atmospheres. He was concerned about the origin

03:15.574 --> 03:21.641
and evolution of planetary atmospheres and 
basically made me do a literature search for him.

03:22.623 --> 03:25.386
And so that kind of got me interested in the 
subject. And I was also interested in photometry.

03:28.026 --> 03:38.823
I'd gotten interested in the possibilities of 
photometry from articles in Sky and Telescope and

03:28.026 --> 03:38.823
articles in Popular Astronomy that I'd read in 
high school and college. And somehow, I can't

03:38.843 --> 03:51.662
remember exactly how now, oh, I guess it must have 
been who probably got me interested in this. What

03:52.583 --> 03:54.386
was your art then, at Harvard? Yeah, at Harvard. 
Let

03:55.640 --> 03:59.445
me think. This was in 1956 or 57. I read a paper by 
Harold Johnson on UBD photometry of Mars. And I

04:11.241 --> 04:22.035
guess because of my interest in photometry and my 
interest in Mars,

04:11.241 --> 04:22.035
honestly, I can't remember at this late date how I 
got into this problem. But I was concerned about

04:22.403 --> 04:25.727
photometry of Mars. I guess I had looked up the old 
Cogger and Guthnick articles. Yeah, that was it.

04:30.913 --> 04:35.078
Looked up the old Cogger and Guthnick articles in 
which they had a rotational light curve of Mars.

04:37.040 --> 04:38.041
What journal was that in? That was in the 
publications of the Berlin Babelsberg

04:38.061 --> 04:48.073
Observatory back around 1914, give or take a 
couple of years. And interestingly enough, I

04:49.218 --> 04:58.392
discovered this past year when I was at the 
Deutsches Museum in Munich that their instrument

04:49.218 --> 04:58.392
has survived and is in the museum there. You can 
actually see that historic instrument. That was

05:00.776 --> 05:08.568
the instrument with which the first anything 
resembling modern photoelectric photometry was

05:00.776 --> 05:08.568
actually done. Well, anyway, they published a 
rotational light curve of Mars. And I noticed that

05:12.194 --> 05:15.479
Harold Johnson's light curve of Mars was totally 
different. Couldn't understand why. and did an

05:18.395 --> 05:21.798
odd thing. I copied out his numbers. This was 
before the days of Xerox machines. So I copied out

05:25.682 --> 05:29.626
his table of numbers, but I didn't want to copy out 
everything. So I just copied out the times and the

05:29.647 --> 05:45.803
magnitudes and took them home with me to work on and 
had a copy of the American Ephemeris and Nautical

05:29.647 --> 05:45.803
Almanac in those days from which I could look up and 
calculate the physical ephemeris of Mars. And

05:51.479 --> 06:02.574
when I did so and calculated central meridians and 
plotted up his results, I got a light curve that

05:51.479 --> 06:02.574
looked just like Carter and Guthnick's and not at 
all like Johnson's. And it took me a long time,

06:02.594 --> 06:06.960
several days, to realize what had happened. But 
when I finally went back and looked at Johnson's

06:07.681 --> 06:14.811
table, where he had central meridians, his 
central meridians were totally different from

06:07.681 --> 06:14.811
mine. And after much cogitation and consulting 
the tables of the astronomical almanac, I finally

06:15.854 --> 06:38.333
realized that what had happened was this, that 
because Mars rotates through about 350 degrees

06:15.854 --> 06:38.333
every day, the central meridians that are listed 
in the almanac and the physical ephemeris differ

06:15.854 --> 06:38.333
by about 10 degrees from one day to the next. And 
Johnson and Gardner had interpolated in this

06:39.154 --> 06:44.899
10-degree arc instead of the 350-degree arc. so i 
caught harold johnson making a dumb mistake and uh

06:45.571 --> 07:09.823
published it in pasp and so offended johnson that i 
was never able to publish in the astrophysical

06:45.571 --> 07:09.823
journal for years but anyway that's that's what 
got me going in that as a result of that effort uh

06:45.571 --> 07:09.823
menzel and the folklore picked me as the guy to take 
over their uh and run on a day-to-day basis their

07:10.360 --> 07:15.127
planetary photometry project that was sponsored 
by NASA. So that's kind of how I got to that stage.

07:17.410 --> 07:20.995
Was that project funded originally by NASA right 
from the very start? So far as I know, it was. Okay,

07:22.478 --> 07:25.842
because NASA didn't start until 1958. Yeah, 
that's right. That project started up a couple of

07:27.264 --> 07:30.028
years after my paper. Menzel and I think Kupel 
might have even been involved in it. And

07:35.196 --> 07:40.063
DeVoe-Klor were, Menzel and DeVoe-Klor at least, 
were the principal investigators. And shortly

07:40.465 --> 07:46.453
after the thing was funded, or maybe even before it 
was funded, the Vocaloid went to Texas. And it was

07:47.714 --> 07:55.845
at that point that they needed somebody else to 
take over the project at Harvard, and I got tapped

07:47.714 --> 07:55.845
for that. I remember Menzel at that meeting. Which 
meeting? meeting where we first met and where the

08:00.361 --> 08:02.964
earth shook. Oh, that's right. That's the meeting 
where you were the guy, you and Roger Moore were the

08:03.845 --> 08:08.611
representatives from NASA headquarters. They 
were the people who were funding you. You were the

08:10.253 --> 08:11.915
guys that were funding me, that's right. So we got 
into the great man Menzel's main office. Into his

08:13.957 --> 08:15.639
office, his inner sanctum. And then we shook hands 
and you were the first speaker and you were leading

08:15.659 --> 08:19.804
on the blackboard. I was writing something on the 
blackboard. And then all of a sudden... Well, all

08:21.986 --> 08:29.355
of a sudden what happened was a heavy truck went by, 
except when you looked out in the street there were

08:21.986 --> 08:29.355
no trucks. And Menzel, as I recall, sat there, 
timing? Looking at his watch. That's right. That

08:35.609 --> 08:37.962
puzzled me that he was looking at his watch. And 
after a while, I dawned on people other than Nunzel

08:39.173 --> 08:45.179
that it was an earthquake. It was just timing and 
periodism. Yes, yes. Anyway, I recall him saying

08:49.583 --> 08:57.831
the justification for this was that actually 
there wasn't any precise one third of the

08:49.583 --> 08:57.831
planetary planets in existence. That's 
absolutely correct. Which kind of didn't astound

08:59.453 --> 09:03.797
me, but it did shake me up a little bit. Yeah, yeah. 
Well, that's because planetary photometry had

09:04.739 --> 09:14.655
been in such bad repute for so many years that 
basically nothing had been done since the work of

09:04.739 --> 09:14.655
the 19th century German observers. Zollner and 
people like that. Zollner, and by the way,

09:16.558 --> 09:21.726
Zollner's original photometer is also in the 
Deutsches Museum if you want to see it. And the

09:22.307 --> 09:29.579
world's very first photometer, the very first 
visual photometer made by Steinhall, is also

09:22.307 --> 09:29.579
still in existence in the Deutsches Museum. It's a 
wonderful place to go with people. are interested

09:31.081 --> 09:33.224
in the history of photometry. This isn't directly 
related to you, but it is directly related to the

09:33.665 --> 09:37.030
project. I have given Zollner more emphasis than 
he normally gets. Zollner and Miller. I read their

09:42.538 --> 09:43.699
papers. Oh, there's an interesting footnote to 
that, by the way. I read the papers by Zollner and

09:47.264 --> 09:57.139
Miller back when I was a graduate student working 
on this problem, looking up the past history of the

09:47.264 --> 09:57.139
subject of planetary photometry. And when I got to 
JPL many years later, One of the things I retained

09:59.785 --> 10:14.245
from that literature search was that the 
properties of Mercury and the properties of the

09:59.785 --> 10:14.245
Moon were very similar and that Mars and indeed all 
these objects were drastically different from

09:59.785 --> 10:14.245
Lambert's law in particular. And of course that 
had also been emphasized by Henry Norris Russell

10:15.227 --> 10:21.455
in his rediscussion of their observations. Back 
in the days when noted astronomers could still do

10:21.475 --> 10:24.920
planetary work. That's right. background again 
uh 1910 1916 it's in the app j back there somewhere

10:26.212 --> 10:50.953
um and when i got to jpl uh there was this big flap 
about the mariner 4 pictures which had had uh very

10:26.212 --> 10:50.953
low contrast and showed a great deal of light 
extending out into the sky beyond the limb of mars

10:26.212 --> 10:50.953
and it turned out that a student of bruce murray's 
had attempted to analyze all this stuff on the

10:51.457 --> 10:57.653
basis of the Lambert law. And, of course, that was 
because Bruce Murray didn't know anything, and

10:58.207 --> 11:05.615
Leighton was a physicist and didn't know anything 
about planetary photometry. Well, but you do

11:05.635 --> 11:08.658
think Mars is much more like the Moon than Earth. 
Yeah, right. And, of course, I knew that the Moon

11:09.419 --> 11:13.823
was drastically different from the Lambert Law. 
So I instantly saw that this was a fallacious

11:14.564 --> 11:24.214
analysis and went on to demonstrate that all that 
was, in fact, due to stray light in their Mariner 4

11:14.564 --> 11:24.214
camera. But at any rate, I remember going down and 
talking to Layton about this on campus one time and

11:24.768 --> 11:34.913
showed him a draft of my paper refuting his work. 
And he said, well, you write this as though any fool

11:35.028 --> 11:38.413
would know better. And I said, well, yeah. Because 
anybody that was familiar with planetary

11:41.617 --> 11:49.809
photometry knew that Lambert's Law was 
definitely not applicable. But let me tell you the

11:50.410 --> 11:52.072
topper on this. The topper was that when I went to 
the Caltech library to look up, to double-check

11:52.132 --> 12:00.023
Mueller's work, the pages were all uncut. No one at 
Caltech had ever read Mueller's work. Oh

12:05.133 --> 12:21.977
yeah, what

12:05.133 --> 12:21.977
I have put in, I guess it's in chapter three, no, 
chapter two, chapter three, is about Zandler's

12:05.133 --> 12:21.977
work and how he, He knew about Lambert's law, and he 
did the first accurate with conical prisms

12:22.463 --> 12:29.071
photometry. He had the polarizing photometer. 
Yeah, moons, variation, brightness, and faith.

12:33.437 --> 12:39.524
And so immediately, there was not Lambert, and got 
this completely unexpected result by an

12:33.437 --> 12:39.524
unexpected method. The moon surface was very 
irregular on a microscopic scale. So Zalner gets

12:45.331 --> 12:49.016
in there, but he certainly was the weirdest 
looking guy ever. Oh, yeah? I've never seen a

12:49.657 --> 12:50.698
picture of him.

12:54.560 --> 12:59.024
Okay, so you did this project at Harvard for how 
long? Oh, until I left Harvard, and it was taken

12:59.044 --> 13:02.527
over by Bill Irvine. And let's see, I left Harvard 
in 63, and I started that project, it must have

13:02.547 --> 13:18.621
been, I started that project before I got my PhD, so 
it must have been around 59, I think, that I began

13:02.547 --> 13:18.621
working on that. So roughly 59 to 63. Okay, and how 
did you get to go to Texas University? Harlan Smith

13:24.412 --> 13:26.437
invited me to go down. Actually, Menzel later told 
me he had told Harlan that I was a good guy and should

13:26.537 --> 13:34.836
be invited for a job interview. Harlan very 
astutely invited me to go to Texas in the middle of

13:35.657 --> 13:42.994
February.

13:43.649 --> 13:45.111
He was well known for that tactic. Yeah, right. It 
worked in my case. I certainly was easily seduced

13:48.154 --> 13:52.138
to a warmer climate. Oh, by the way, I forgot to 
mention at the beginning, this interview is being

13:52.158 --> 13:58.905
taped at the Shorn Ranch in Brazos County, Texas. 
All right. OK, so you accepted. So I immediately

14:01.288 --> 14:07.734
accepted Harlan's invitation and left. So when 
did you actually begin at UT? I began at UT. I've got

14:13.563 --> 14:15.366
to make a correction here, Ron. My memory had 
failed me there for a minute. I actually left that

14:17.929 --> 14:30.746
planetary technology project a couple of years 
earlier, 61 or 62, because I had been offered a

14:17.929 --> 14:30.746
postdoc position by ORT. And because of family 
complications, I was never able to accept that.

14:37.114 --> 14:39.778
But I had resigned my position. And Bill Irvine 
took that over a year or so before I went to Texas. So

14:45.242 --> 14:47.644
what did you do between the time you left that 
project? I was working on another solar system

14:47.664 --> 14:53.209
project that was run by Hector Angrio at Harvard's 
Smithsonian. He was making 10 micron thermal

14:54.110 --> 14:58.534
infrared measurements of the moon. And there were 
about six people working on that. There was

15:00.756 --> 15:04.339
Hector, who was in charge of the project and was a 
very good engineer. He had designed the

15:05.520 --> 15:08.803
instrument that we used. There was an electronics 
technician who built amplifiers for the

15:09.391 --> 15:15.079
instrument. There was a mechanical engineer that 
did the precise machining that was required. And

15:21.789 --> 15:24.493
there were a couple of secretaries and data 
reducers. And I was the astronomer. I was the

15:26.195 --> 15:27.557
observer on that. Back in the days when 
astronomers actually observed? I'll say

15:32.043 --> 15:33.806
astronomers actually observed. I had the 
privilege, Paul, on that project of observing at

15:36.425 --> 15:46.114
the Newtonian focus of the Radcliffe reflector 
when it was still outside Pretoria on the coldest

15:36.425 --> 15:46.114
night ever recorded in Pretoria. I was up there 
freezing and relaying temperatures from the

15:46.134 --> 15:58.766
thermometer we had at the eyepiece, and 
Thackeray, the observatory director, was saying

15:46.134 --> 15:58.766
to Hector, he must be reading the thermometer 
wrong. It never gets that cold here. How cold was

16:00.308 --> 16:01.609
it? It was something like 20 degrees. It was well 
below freezing. Tell me something about, well,

16:06.057 --> 16:09.320
there's two questions. One is about Menzo, who I 
can interview. And then we'll get on to a more

16:14.185 --> 16:17.529
general question. But first of all, Menzo had one 
of the early, when he was out of grad school or

16:17.709 --> 16:27.279
something, he did an estimate of Martian surface 
pressure. Oh, did he? I wasn't aware of that. Well,

16:28.861 --> 16:35.828
back in 1926, Menzo had published an article using 
visual photographic albedo observations. Okay,

16:40.361 --> 16:43.866
so that must have been why Menzel was interested in 
photometry of Mars as well. Right, and an upper

16:43.886 --> 16:56.647
limit for the surface pressure of Mars, which it 
turns out was correct, and in fact was below the

16:43.886 --> 16:56.647
value quoted by Gerard de Bacallure in his famous 
book, Physics of the Planet. That's interesting.

16:57.549 --> 16:58.290
I didn't know that. And there is a story that I have 
heard that I can't document, to the effect that

17:01.711 --> 17:08.020
Menzel was taken aside by somebody at Harvard, 
presumably the great man himself. Carlos

17:08.040 --> 17:21.079
Shackley told a young man, if you want to keep a job 
in astronomy, if you want to feature in this field,

17:08.040 --> 17:21.079
that you should get out of this nonsense of 
planetary astronomy and get into real astronomy.

17:21.099 --> 17:22.121
Have you heard anything about that? I haven't 
heard that story, or at least I don't remember

17:22.141 --> 17:28.410
hearing that story, but it sounds entirely 
credible. I can't interview Menzel. What kind of a

17:30.999 --> 17:34.367
guy was he? Well, at the time I was a graduate 
student, Menzel was a terrible stuffed shirt. He

17:40.420 --> 17:41.603
was pompous. He was not keeping up with current 
events scientifically. I remember there was a

17:45.913 --> 17:47.817
notorious occasion. in which Armin Deutsch had 
done a spherical harmonic analysis of magnetic

17:48.185 --> 17:59.025
fields on some rotating magnetic star. And at the 
end of his talk, this was at a AAS meeting that was

18:00.027 --> 18:04.776
actually held in Cambridge, At the end of his talk, 
Menzel stood up and said, well, have you

18:05.212 --> 18:13.285
considered using spherical harmonics? And 
Deutsch looked absolutely baffled and said, but I

18:13.305 --> 18:17.311
thought that's what I did. That was kind of a 
typical Menzel performance. He was just out of it

18:21.137 --> 18:23.621
and over the hill by then. And strangely enough, as 
a result of this planetary photometry project,

18:31.199 --> 18:43.117
One of the things that came out was a really good 
measurement of the albedo of Venus as a function of

18:31.199 --> 18:43.117
wavelength, which really showed quantitatively 
the amount of absorption in the ultraviolet. And

18:43.978 --> 18:48.465
shortly before he died, I ran into Menzel at a An IAU 
symposium in Torun, Poland. That would have been

18:53.156 --> 18:56.081
in 73 or 74. Copernicus. The Copernicus thing, 
yeah. And Menzel had the temerity to say to me, I've

18:59.446 --> 19:07.700
never believed in this ultraviolet absorber on 
VS. It looks white to me. I was just speechless. I

19:13.790 --> 19:25.527
didn't know what to say because it was his own 
project that had quantitatively shown the

19:13.790 --> 19:25.527
existence of the ultraviolet absorber that had 
been previously inferred, of course, from W.H.

19:25.567 --> 19:29.573
Wright's photographs and other such 
measurements much earlier.

19:33.518 --> 19:36.341
You had Whipple, who certainly was interested in 
the solar system. Yeah, Whipple was a good guy to

19:36.361 --> 19:37.763
work for. And you had Menzel, who had been and now 
was interested in the solar system. Yeah, had an

19:42.488 --> 19:46.773
interest, but he was full of useless information. 
One thing he did, for example, on Venus was to

19:46.833 --> 19:57.585
imagine that the high temperature measured for 
Venus was due to an enormous electron density in

19:46.833 --> 19:57.585
its ionosphere. So he sent me off on a wild goose 
chase to learn about ionospheres. Oh, man. I

20:04.158 --> 20:05.380
looked that stuff up. I quickly found he was off by 
many orders of magnitude. And that taught me just

20:08.947 --> 20:12.755
to ignore anything that Menzel suggested after 
that. And he quickly forgot these suggestions for

20:12.875 --> 20:15.881
the most part. You could sort of nod and smile and 
then go off and ignore them. But there's other

20:20.515 --> 20:23.359
people who were there at the same time, like 
Imbrow. Yes. And also there was Whipple and JL and

20:24.461 --> 20:31.971
Hynek and those people because they had the, what 
was it, the IGY? Oh, that was the Moonwatch

20:32.392 --> 20:37.319
business that Smithsonian was running. Well, 
that means that at least at that time, they were

20:37.659 --> 20:45.510
willing to take money to do research on the solar 
system, which, as I gather, Let me tell you

20:45.490 --> 20:50.599
something about Quipple's connection in this. 
Quipple got into this through the meteor program.

20:53.344 --> 21:03.702
Harvard had a long-standing meteor program that 
involved Quipple because of his interest in

20:53.344 --> 21:03.702
meteors and comets and meteoroids as fragments of 
comets and so on. Luigi Acchia, I'm not quite sure

21:04.137 --> 21:08.842
how he got into it. And there were several people at 
Harvard who were supported on the media program.

21:14.548 --> 21:17.611
They also developed the Super Schmidt cameras. 
The Super Schmidt cameras were developed by Baker

21:17.891 --> 21:28.542
himself, who was associated, he was some kind of an 
associate on the Harvard staff, not paid by

21:17.891 --> 21:28.542
Harvard, but had an office and showed up about once 
a month. And so Whipple's interest in the upper

21:28.522 --> 21:44.925
atmosphere densities, or I shouldn't say his 
interest, but his authority as an expert on upper

21:28.522 --> 21:44.925
atmosphere densities got him called in very 
early, before even there was a NASA, there was a

21:28.522 --> 21:44.925
thing called the rocket panel. Remember the 
rocket panel? That was set up to decide how to use

21:46.628 --> 21:55.120
scientifically the V2 rockets that have been 
captured at the end of World War II. And later, when

21:55.673 --> 22:02.841
the IGY came along, that had its name expanded, and 
it became the Rocket and Satellite Panel. And

22:02.861 --> 22:06.125
people remained a member of it when it was the 
Rocket and Satellite Panel. So he was there on that

22:07.466 --> 22:15.776
panel as an expert on upper atmosphere densities, 
which he had gotten through the Meteor Project.

22:15.796 --> 22:21.723
And so that was how this business of satellite 
tracking, I'm sure how he got the connection

22:15.796 --> 22:21.723
there. But still, for Volker, there were many 
great It was considered demeaning to work for NSA

22:25.998 --> 22:32.006
or prostituting yourself. It was dirty money, and 
the planetary work was a dead end because it had all

22:32.787 --> 22:41.098
been done by Adams and Dutton and Polarges. Did you 
find that at Harvard? Oh, yes. You certainly got

22:43.682 --> 22:45.164
that attitude. And I remember when Kuiper came and 
talked to us, He mentioned that he had received

22:52.002 --> 22:57.828
criticism for doing that Lunar Atlas project. 
Which was done with Air Force One. That's right.

23:01.853 --> 23:08.640
But he had been criticized for doing that instead 
of doing honest astronomy, you know, decent

23:01.853 --> 23:08.640
astronomy. Because Piper had started out doing 
things like the effective temperature scale. He

23:13.185 --> 23:19.832
had a paper in the 1930s, 36-ish, as I recall, late 
30s sometime. in which he had done a good

23:19.812 --> 23:23.858
recalibration of the effective temperature 
scale. It started out in stellar astronomy. Then

23:26.122 --> 23:35.677
he went into close binaries and mass ratios, which 
led him into a mass ratio association plan between

23:26.122 --> 23:35.677
Sun and Jupiter. Did you get the feeling that this 
new planetary and solar system work at second rate

23:36.338 --> 23:47.035
was general? It certainly was, yeah.

23:52.583 --> 23:55.687
Did Harvard take any money from the Air Force? 
Harvard had a lot of Air Force money, and the reason

23:56.869 --> 24:03.459
was that the Air Force Bedford Laboratories, as 
they were called. Well, it was originally the Air

24:03.699 --> 24:08.406
Force Cambridge Research Laboratories, and they 
moved out to Bedford. But the Air Force labs were

24:08.466 --> 24:14.355
nearby, and people at Harvard Observatory had 
connections there. And so there were a lot of

24:14.858 --> 24:18.244
airport-sponsored projects. For example, I was 
hired one summer to try to make sense of a release of

24:18.264 --> 24:32.149
a barium cloud or something like that from, maybe 
it was nitric oxide, but anyway, something that

24:18.264 --> 24:32.149
was released from a rocket in the upper 
atmosphere. They'd used the Super Schmitz to take

24:32.609 --> 24:35.174
photographs of it. They wanted to track the 
motion. get upper atmosphere winds, that kind of

24:37.184 --> 24:40.508
stuff. So yeah, there was a lot of that kind of stuff 
going on at Harvard. There was also Office of Naval

24:44.053 --> 24:51.523
Research, but that was done for more classical 
type of stellar astronomical studies. Gee, there

24:51.543 --> 24:56.029
was a lot of ONR work, but I was never employed on one 
of the ONR programs. So I can't really tell you, but

24:56.109 --> 25:00.255
I know people talked about ONR. The ONR got 
involved, you remember, early in radio

25:00.674 --> 25:03.978
astronomy. They had that radio dish on top of their 
building in Washington someplace. They also

25:08.103 --> 25:10.547
built the radio telescope at the University of 
Illinois. Oh, did they? Okay. So because one of the

25:12.609 --> 25:18.677
first places involved in radio astronomy was 
Harvard, there were connections there, I guess.

25:19.838 --> 25:23.263
Bach, you remember, was one of the people who was 
involved in radio astronomy. He was 21 centimeter

25:23.323 --> 25:24.765
long. And because of Ewan and Purcell's work in... 
the co-discovery of the 21 centimeter line there

25:30.323 --> 25:33.327
at Harvard. That was why radio astronomy got an 
early start at Harvard earlier than many other

25:35.389 --> 25:39.855
places. In fact, it was while I was a graduate 
student that they finally decided about my third

25:40.976 --> 25:56.635
or fourth year in graduate school that they were 
going to give a different set of prelim exams to the

25:40.976 --> 25:56.635
radio astronomers because they needed a 
sufficiently different background than the

25:40.976 --> 25:56.635
optical astronomers. Instead of giving the same 
set of questions to everybody, they were going to

25:57.104 --> 26:04.820
have a two-track system. When NSA was first born, 
that was, let's see, 59, I guess. No, 58. 58,

26:13.719 --> 26:16.002
probably, because it was right after school. What 
was the attitude by then? You got your Ph.D. I

26:20.869 --> 26:21.430
forgot. I got my Ph.D. in 61 or 62, so I was still a 
graduate student. But what were the comments you

26:26.277 --> 26:30.083
heard about NESA? Because they were coming with a 
lot of money, space research, solar system

26:30.203 --> 26:36.572
research. What sort of comments did you hear from 
science? Oh, gosh. There wasn't an awful lot of

26:40.540 --> 26:43.444
reaction to it at first. The main interest around 
Harvard was in the satellite tracking program.

26:48.011 --> 26:52.378
Huppel and Hynek were the guys that were the chief 
motivators behind that.

26:55.242 --> 27:08.202
I guess the bigger

26:55.242 --> 27:08.202
scandal at the time was the fight over moving the 
Smithsonian Astrophysical Observatory from

26:55.242 --> 27:08.202
Washington to Cambridge. because it had always 
been associated with the Smithsonian

27:08.907 --> 27:15.435
Institution of Washington in the era of Charles 
Greeley Abbott. And Whipple and other people who

27:16.316 --> 27:23.606
were interested in solar activity had been very 
critical of Abbott's work. And the whole thing

27:24.867 --> 27:34.780
was, when Whipple was made the new director, the 
whole thing was just picked up and moved to Harvard

27:24.867 --> 27:34.780
and Abbott's stuff and the whole Solar constant 
measurement program, all that stuff was done. So

27:39.421 --> 27:41.643
it was a major change in direction. And I think that 
was more of a notorious cause than the creation of

27:42.344 --> 27:58.078
NASA, which wasn't viewed as being terribly 
important at first, at least not by the people at

27:42.344 --> 27:58.078
Harvard. As I say, we got some grants from NASA, and 
it was regarded as kind of just another funding

28:04.190 --> 28:15.485
agency like the Air Force.

28:16.306 --> 28:26.940
Well,

28:16.306 --> 28:26.940
when they started up, of course, things were much 
more informal and less bureaucratic than they are

28:16.306 --> 28:26.940
today When they started up, the bureaucracy was 
not so multilevel, and the oversight of contracts

28:27.308 --> 28:39.423
was much more simplified. I used to send in 
quarterly reports about a page long that were

28:39.483 --> 28:51.978
hardly more than a letter, and we'd have an annual 
report that would be maybe five or six pages long,

28:39.483 --> 28:51.978
but nothing terribly big. I had a secretary that 
did some of the financial accounting that was

28:55.878 --> 28:58.662
required. All that stuff had to be done in-house. 
There weren't these grant handling subsidiaries

29:02.569 --> 29:08.057
that organizations have these days. And so it was 
all kept to the level where individual scientists

29:08.137 --> 29:14.587
could manage it. So it was quite tolerable at that 
time in the 60s. It gradually grew more and more

29:19.375 --> 29:22.560
top-heavy as time went on. Now, since I've been on 
both sides of this issue, I can ask you this with

29:23.198 --> 29:30.245
equal subjectivity at both ends. All right. Back 
in the early days, there was a lot of comment among

29:31.245 --> 29:40.995
scientists, the managers, the people who were 
coming monitoring contracts from the United

29:31.245 --> 29:40.995
States, were incompetent and didn't know any 
science. And they just had to put up with these

29:41.755 --> 29:44.117
fools. Do you think that was the widespread 
attitude? I do think so. I guess there was

29:50.806 --> 30:05.488
criticism of NASA really fairly early on that it 
had staffed its organization with people swept up

29:50.806 --> 30:05.488
off the street rather than with competent 
scientists.

30:08.292 --> 30:12.359
There wasn't an awful lot of scientific expertise 
at NASA headquarters. As I say, we regarded NASA as

30:13.120 --> 30:18.568
kind of similar to NASA. the Air Force in terms of 
being a funding agency. We didn't have any

30:22.106 --> 30:28.735
impression that the NASA guys had much 
astronomical background. And in fact, as I

30:28.775 --> 30:38.468
recall, I wrote a nasty letter to the editor of 
science back in, oh goodness, when was it? It must

30:38.508 --> 30:45.518
have been about that time, 59, 60, 61, somewhere in 
there, about the time I got my PhD, complaining

30:38.508 --> 30:45.518
about people talking about things outside low 
Earth orbit as deep space. And I was called on the

30:51.784 --> 31:09.649
carpet by Menzel for offending these granting 
agencies and telling me that I should clear

30:51.784 --> 31:09.649
anything like that that went out with him before I 
sent it out.

31:11.080 --> 31:17.411
I guess you should go back and read what I wrote in 
that letter to science if you can dig it up. Okay, so

31:17.852 --> 31:20.015
you went to Texas in what year? 63, yeah. Was it 63 or 
was it 65? Let me think now. You were at Harvard in

31:25.926 --> 31:29.592
either 63 or 64 whenever that earthquake took 
place. Okay, so it must have been 65 when I was in

31:29.852 --> 31:34.320
Texas for two years. Must have gone in 65 and left in 
67. Yeah, that would be right. Went to Texas in 65. I

31:40.667 --> 31:43.370
said 63 earlier, but that was wrong. OK. Now, at 
Texas, the director at that time was Harlan J.

31:43.410 --> 31:47.434
Smith. Right. What kind of a guy was Harlan? Harlan 
was an interesting guy. He radiated sincerity,

31:53.400 --> 32:04.071
which made him a master of grantsmanship.

32:04.675 --> 32:11.183
He unfortunately didn't radiate scientific 
competence, or at least not to me. I was appalled at

32:12.445 --> 32:15.189
some of the things he did. But he was enthusiastic, 
and I'm sure he believed everything he said. The

32:21.697 --> 32:23.760
sincerity was not a fake. And he was very good at 
building up the department there, and argued

32:25.161 --> 32:34.193
continually that they had to make the place big 
before they could make it good. And I had just the

32:35.152 --> 32:38.596
opposite view, which contributed to my leaving. I 
didn't like the way things were going.

32:44.842 --> 32:55.514
But Harlem was entirely pleasant, but not real 
savvy as far as science goes, I would say. Now, DFT

32:55.534 --> 33:03.302
was unusual in that it was possible to get 
telescope time from a major telescope, 82-inch.

33:04.430 --> 33:05.652
to do work on the planets. That's right. Was that 
due to Harlan? That was probably DeVocalor's

33:08.896 --> 33:12.040
influence, I would guess. I think Harlan 
respected GDV very considerably, and I think it

33:12.881 --> 33:26.438
was probably DeVocalor who pushed the planetary 
aspect there. Of course, after the 107 inch was

33:26.458 --> 33:33.407
built, that was specifically for the purpose of 
planetary stuff, and that was part of around

33:33.623 --> 33:38.989
Zempire building effort, and so he was happy to 
follow the NASA money in that direction. But there

33:39.730 --> 33:46.838
was some planetary work done with smaller 
telescopes, in particular a lot done with the

33:39.730 --> 33:46.838
82-inch. Well, for a long time, that was the only 
large telescope in the world that devoted a

33:48.380 --> 33:55.948
significant fraction of its time to planetary 
work. Oh, yeah. Yeah. You remember Toby Owen's

33:58.011 --> 34:01.875
story when he was at Caltech for a semester. Did you 
talk to Toby Owen about this? I saw him in October,

34:05.010 --> 34:07.253
but we didn't have time. Okay, you need to ask him 
about this. He spent either a semester or a year, I

34:09.015 --> 34:12.981
forget which, at Caltech. And he wanted to get 
some, I think, twilight time to observe Venus or

34:14.382 --> 34:21.031
Mars or something like that. And they wouldn't 
give him any 200-inch time to look at anything

34:21.752 --> 34:27.880
planetary.

34:28.822 --> 34:31.132
But then, what the heck was it? He put in a proposal 
to observe a comet or something like that. And they

34:35.008 --> 34:39.085
granted him time for that, which surprised him. 
And he was very keenly aware of the anti-solar

34:39.419 --> 34:44.668
system bias. And the only way he could understand 
getting time to observe this comet was he figured

34:44.948 --> 34:59.412
the guys at Caltech must figure that stars come 
from comets because they didn't see what the

34:44.948 --> 34:59.412
connection was with planets, obviously. Okay, 
where did you go from Texas? From Texas, I went for a

35:04.597 --> 35:16.013
brief time to the Aerospace Corporation in El 
Segundo, and then after about six months to the Jet

35:04.597 --> 35:16.013
Propulsion Laboratory in Pasadena. At the 
Aerospace, where I was taking the night shift on

35:16.114 --> 35:27.049
the millimeter radio telescope at the time, which 
is why I seldom saw you there, you were supposed to

35:16.114 --> 35:27.049
do solar astronomy. That's right. Aerospace had 
the solar observatory, which was at Upper Van

35:31.394 --> 35:36.741
Norman Reservoir in Sylmar, I believe it was. And 
they had had a program of photographing the solar

35:37.962 --> 35:51.359
granulation for several years with a small 
telescope on Kodak 649 film, which was a super high

35:37.962 --> 35:51.359
resolution film. The grains, in fact, were so 
small that they were actually smaller on the

35:52.180 --> 36:00.490
average than the penetration depth of optical 
radiation into silver. So when you hold up these

36:02.681 --> 36:06.686
negatives, they look greenish by transmitted 
light. That's how small the grain size was. And

36:10.211 --> 36:19.002
they were trying to understand seeing at their 
site, which was sometimes good and sometimes bad.

36:19.022 --> 36:26.292
And I had done some work on simulation and 
atmospheric turbulence, and I think that was what

36:19.022 --> 36:26.292
they were interested in there. Okay, so then where 
did you go and why to JPL? I went to JPL and got a job at

36:30.386 --> 36:39.195
JPL working with, what the heck was that group 
called? I

36:41.437 --> 36:45.602
can't remember. What year was it? That would have 
been 68, I guess. And what was that group doing in

36:53.029 --> 36:56.953
particular? The group I was with was involved in 
the design of the Mariner cameras for Mariner 6 and

36:57.457 --> 37:04.288
7. And I had been there for, oh, probably a couple of 
months, finishing up some papers I'd been working

37:05.430 --> 37:11.840
on earlier. And one day my boss came by and said, you 
should be going to these Tuesday morning

37:11.880 --> 37:17.509
meetings. I said, what Tuesday morning meetings? 
Well, it turned out these Tuesday morning

37:20.994 --> 37:23.498
meetings were the the Yerner 6 and 7, I guess it was 
called Yerner 67 at that time, because that was the

37:24.018 --> 37:34.768
year, imaging team meeting. And that was Robert 
Layton, Bruce Murray, a bunch of JPL engineers.

37:41.854 --> 37:44.216
There'd be about a thousand people in the room, 
typically. And so I went to those meetings, and it

37:45.437 --> 37:53.805
quickly became apparent that one of the things 
they were concerned about was getting the

37:45.437 --> 37:53.805
exposure correct. for this next round of Mariner 
photographs of Mars, TV pictures of Mars. And

38:01.101 --> 38:07.210
since I'd had some experience with planetary 
photometry, they tapped me to look into the

38:01.101 --> 38:07.210
problem. They had a very strange algorithm built 
into their camera, which, because the camera

38:08.111 --> 38:19.067
scans slowly across the disk of the planet at a 
fixed phase angle, we just called it a fixed angle,

38:19.385 --> 38:29.960
as the spacecraft swept by, they would sample a 
little piece of the leading edge of one frame to

38:19.385 --> 38:29.960
guess what the exposure should be for the next 
frame. However, this was complicated by the fact

38:29.980 --> 38:35.207
that all our frames were taken with red and green 
filters. And there was some funny thing. They had

38:38.151 --> 38:48.565
originally planned to have a third filter in the 
system, a blue filter or something like that, and

38:38.151 --> 38:48.565
then decided not to, to reduce the data to be 
transmitted back or something like that. So

38:49.338 --> 38:55.266
there'd be a red and a green pair and another red and 
a green pair and another red and a green pair and

38:49.338 --> 38:55.266
gaps in between the pairs. And so I made a little 
simulation program to predict for various

38:56.608 --> 39:06.062
reasonable photometric functions, not Lambert, 
what was going on. It was as a result of that project

39:06.082 --> 39:10.468
that I dug back into the We ordered four stops that 
Leighton and Murray had done and showed it was

39:10.887 --> 39:14.333
wrong. Actually, it was what Murray's graduate 
student had done that was wrong. I don't think

39:17.838 --> 39:20.042
Leighton and Murray really knew what was going on.

39:23.007 --> 39:26.473
OK. How long did you stay at JPL? Let's see. I left 
JPL in,

39:27.234 --> 39:36.249
what was it, 73? 73. OK. What did you do at JPL 
besides the photometric stuff? Well, I was

39:45.219 --> 39:53.067
involved in that business, and they sort of, after 
the fact, packed me onto their TV team there from

39:45.219 --> 39:53.067
Mariner 6 and 7. And then the next project was the 
Mariner 69 project, which was Mariners 8 and 9.

39:58.773 --> 40:02.677
Mariner 8 wound up at the bottom of the Atlantic 
Ocean, but Mariner 9 made it to Mars. So I was on that

40:02.817 --> 40:05.920
TV team from the inception of it. And I was also 
involved in some other stuff. Mariner 10 I was

40:13.340 --> 40:15.703
peripherally involved in. I was the guy who told 
them they needed to take UV pictures of Venus to see

40:15.723 --> 40:21.609
what the cloud features looked like. If it hadn't 
have been for me, they might not have thought of

40:22.170 --> 40:24.713
that. It was certainly at my insistence that they 
had to get into the UV, that they planned UV

40:24.773 --> 40:31.700
capabilities for the camera there. Then when 
Viking came along, I was on the Viking lander team.

40:36.697 --> 40:37.879
and was involved in that. That was a funny thing, 
because I got into that after the fact. The Viking

40:40.542 --> 40:51.357
lander team, there had been a pre, you know, 
there's always these, before the project exists,

40:40.542 --> 40:51.357
there's the group put together to plan for it. And 
there had been this lander camera team that had

40:52.198 --> 41:06.518
written an impossible set of specifications 
where they wanted to focus from three feet to

40:52.198 --> 41:06.518
infinity with no changes in focus or at most one 
focus step or something like that. And they wanted

41:06.717 --> 41:10.183
a thousand to one signal to noise ratio. And they 
wanted to scan at a certain rate so that you could

41:10.884 --> 41:16.754
only look at a piece of the scene for a tenth of a 
millisecond. And all these requirements were

41:17.715 --> 41:20.580
mutually exclusive. If you just look at the laws of 
physics, in order to get the angular resolution,

41:20.600 --> 41:26.850
they demanded you have to add a lens a certain size. 
In order to get the lens that big, you had to have

41:27.371 --> 41:31.999
something like five or six focus steps between a 
meter and infinity and besides if you made the lens

41:31.979 --> 41:59.758
small enough that you could focus from here to 
there with only one or two focus steps then you

41:31.979 --> 41:59.758
didn't get enough photons in to meet their signal 
to noise requirement it was all a hodgepodge and i

41:31.979 --> 41:59.758
just i i somehow came across this memo with their 
design statement as to what it was to do realized

41:31.979 --> 41:59.758
that this contradicted the laws of physics wrote a 
memo pointing this out and got stuck on that team

41:31.979 --> 41:59.758
for a while Where did you go after JPL? After JPL, 
let's see, I must have gone here to Texas A&M,

42:04.041 --> 42:09.309
mustn't I? Yeah. And what did you do at Texas A&M? At 
Texas A&M, well, I survived on my Viking money for a

42:12.553 --> 42:16.078
while. I did some part-time teaching. Had several 
proposals turned down by the National Science

42:19.362 --> 42:23.408
Foundation. One day I got a phone call from... I got 
a phone call from somebody at NASA headquarters

42:29.185 --> 42:37.968
saying, somebody was saying, why aren't there any 
proposals from Andy Young? So they asked me to send

42:38.971 --> 42:44.325
them a proposal, and I sent them a proposal on 
something, which I can no longer recall. which was

42:45.048 --> 42:46.109
funded. And George Catawar and I did a lot of work in 
which we looked at the brightness distribution

42:46.630 --> 43:01.364
over the disk of Mars and Venus in various 
spacecraft pictures and studied balloon

42:46.630 --> 43:01.364
darkening and the scattering properties of the 
atmospheres and stuff like that. Still

43:01.404 --> 43:11.494
continuing basic planetary photometric stuff 
and doing on the side a certain amount of planetary

43:01.404 --> 43:11.494
spectroscopy. And then where did you go from 
there? To San Diego State. And where you still are.

43:20.217 --> 43:21.118
Well, sort of. And when did that happen? That would 
have been 80 or something like that. 81. It was

43:29.129 --> 43:30.871
right at the beginning of 81. And Louise had put in 
for a National Research Council travel grant to go

43:40.634 --> 43:52.532
and work with the people at the Space Research 
Institute in Moscow on the Venera spectra of

43:40.634 --> 43:52.532
Venus. And we hadn't had time to move in even in San 
Diego before it was time to go off and pick that up.

44:00.483 --> 44:07.013
So we just locked up the house and went off to Moscow 
for three months. And that worked out okay. We had a

44:09.019 --> 44:15.385
very interesting time in Moscow working with 
Moroz and his co-workers and found they had a very

44:09.019 --> 44:15.385
sharp group there. Very clever people. And what 
have you been doing lately? Lately? Well... After

44:20.610 --> 44:22.652
you came back from Moscow. Okay. After I came back 
from Moscow, I continued to have some support from

44:23.953 --> 44:28.717
NASA for a few years. That eventually petered out 
and I wasn't able to resuscitate it. But about the

44:32.221 --> 44:36.004
time that died, I got a grant from NSF, which I've 
been living on for the past three or four years, in

44:36.558 --> 44:47.169
stellar photometry, which was my interest for 
many years also, in parallel with planetary

44:36.558 --> 44:47.169
photometry. And in, I remember it was, 89? Yes, 89, 
I became the vice president of Commission 25,

44:56.458 --> 45:03.645
which is stellar photometry and polarimetry. and 
then became the president of the succeeding

45:04.233 --> 45:08.319
meeting in Buenos Aires. So I'm currently 
coordinating the activities of IAU Commission 25

45:09.160 --> 45:15.668
on stellar photometry. So I've kind of gotten out 
of the planetary business as a result. Do you think

45:20.715 --> 45:29.387
that the real quote-unquote astronomers still 
look down on planetary studies, solar system

45:20.715 --> 45:29.387
studies? Not as much as they used to for several 
reasons. One is that people have begun to

45:34.793 --> 45:54.899
appreciate the connection between planets and 
the process of star formation and to realize that

45:34.793 --> 45:54.899
planetary systems are a useful link in 
understanding the star formation process,

45:34.793 --> 45:54.899
questions of chemical evolution in the galaxy and 
things of that sort. This also is a link between

45:56.701 --> 46:01.527
things like the giant molecular clouds and 
stellar astronomy and these objects also play an

46:01.878 --> 46:25.945
important dynamical part in the rotation of 
galaxies so i think the field has become more

46:01.878 --> 46:25.945
unified with the rest of astronomy and people see 
the interconnections of these fields more than

46:01.878 --> 46:25.945
they used to i think it's less compartmentalized 
in a way even though things have become more

46:01.878 --> 46:25.945
specialized in recent years
