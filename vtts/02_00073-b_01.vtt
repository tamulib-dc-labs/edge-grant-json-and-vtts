WEBVTT

00:02.377 --> 00:04.761
Oh yes, some more than that. I'm very fortunate 
that when Jack Williams came here the second

00:07.125 --> 00:20.908
summer, well he came in the fall, and that summer he 
had a commencement, that first summer.

01:04.730 --> 01:13.388
I had the December commencement, and I was knees 
knocking together, withdrawn at the words. I was

01:13.408 --> 01:15.553
just trembling up there. He

01:15.573 --> 01:23.329
just admires, he admires.

01:28.962 --> 01:51.696
that because in the fall of fall of 76 i had a 
surgical procedure and his he had his office send

01:28.962 --> 01:51.696
me flowers when i was in the hospital and brian and 
then when i went to houston for the surgery he had

01:28.962 --> 01:51.696
him sent down there and every time i saw him but boy 
that first commencement i was just terrified it

01:28.962 --> 01:51.696
was it was really that's like that's the only one 
that i really was terrified, but I never felt

01:51.676 --> 01:58.402
comfortable in front of that, including this last 
time. I never really felt comfortable. You always

01:59.743 --> 02:09.772
had this fear of misreading, of getting lost, 
because it's really not an easy job. The print is

02:10.673 --> 02:21.683
not very big, and it's very easy to get distracted, 
and you really have to bear down and concentrate.

02:21.663 --> 02:23.625
Let's digress a second. Make believe what I didn't 
know and love as deeply as you did the man named Jack

02:23.646 --> 02:30.114
Williams. Describe Jack Williams.

02:39.125 --> 02:45.393
I had the greatest respect for him because he did 
things. Not that Mr. Rutter didn't. Mr. Rutter did

02:47.496 --> 02:48.497
too. But Jack Williams really set out to make 
things happen and to broaden the scope and to make

02:48.983 --> 02:59.455
the university continue to grow, and it did. The 
man who came in in the early 80s and then

03:02.118 --> 03:10.427
subsequently went to Iowa State, Gordon Eaton, 
was one of the same type. He wasn't as fortunate.

03:38.157 --> 03:39.759
If there were any people who ever knew that. I don't 
think, but the board was told that. It's just

03:44.907 --> 03:49.394
because there's such a contrast. The two have 
absolutely nothing similar at all, either in

03:49.414 --> 03:55.944
methods or modes. But Rudder was much more quiet. I 
can remember Dr. Williams speaking to a faculty

03:59.429 --> 04:04.637
convocation one day and I'm surprised he didn't 
get fired on the spot with the number of times he

04:06.338 --> 04:10.543
insulted the Board of Regents. That did get him 
into trouble? Yes. You saw Williams at church?

04:17.251 --> 04:17.472
Yes. But only this, it was a high, because I sang in a 
choir and didn't see him. I never really had many

04:25.922 --> 04:30.788
visits with him, but I just really admired the man 
for what he did. Did you see evidences of his sense

04:30.808 --> 04:33.591
of humor ever? Oh, yes. and uh uh remember we had 
some kind of a thing at uh when harry green was the

04:37.152 --> 05:00.291
manager of at that time the aggie land inn when it 
was first built they had some kind of a there

05:10.936 --> 05:12.838
In the early 70s.

05:15.442 --> 05:19.887
He was a man whom I really admired and respected a 
great deal. He became and always will be my role

05:19.907 --> 05:23.792
model. He'd have to be anybody's. And then I got a 
great deal from Eaton. Dr. Williams was followed

05:29.719 --> 05:31.862
by Jarvis Miller. Did any of the other presidents 
that came after Williams, did they...

05:41.277 --> 05:44.620
No, no, no.

05:46.883 --> 05:48.144
I enjoyed Frank Vandiver. You can't be around 
Frank Vandiver for more than 20 seconds and not

05:49.886 --> 05:52.969
enjoy him. He is a tremendous,

05:53.850 --> 06:01.057
he's an outgoing personality. Friendly, warm, hi 
to everybody. I'm an amateur historian as well,

06:08.378 --> 06:19.208
and I found that when he spoke, he had such a 
commanding voice when he spoke. I haven't asked

06:21.010 --> 06:23.712
anybody else this question. Of all the presidents 
that you have seen in public views, I'm going to ask

06:24.633 --> 06:32.000
the negative. Which ones would you give the 
highest grades to which ones for their ability to

06:37.387 --> 06:46.764
handle public events

06:37.387 --> 06:46.764
like commencement and things like that? Who did it 
best? Oh, I think Dr. Williams.

06:53.958 --> 06:57.982
He was so comfortable, and so he was in charge. He 
made it look like he hadn't prepared, but I now know

06:59.683 --> 07:07.690
he had prepared very well. Mr. Rudder was not a 
forceful speaker, mumbled a little bit, and

07:07.810 --> 07:16.218
didn't have good continuity. And then I would 
suppose that Dr. Vandiver was probably, would be

07:16.558 --> 07:23.965
next. Because he, again, was so sure of himself in 
public. Who was actually responsible for the

07:29.916 --> 07:37.832
operation of commencement?

07:43.362 --> 07:44.805
That's the registrar's show. materials

07:46.000 --> 08:10.658
i've

07:46.000 --> 08:10.658
never had one

08:29.909 --> 08:41.026
21,

08:29.909 --> 08:41.026
22 years. And more time,

08:41.046 --> 08:51.242
because he was And because he was a student affairs 
dean in the College of Education, commencement

08:53.180 --> 08:59.586
week was a nightmare for him. And so I figured I had 
more time to particularly in those days, because

08:59.986 --> 09:14.780
up until the time when seniors had to take exams, 
those of us who taught seniors were through

08:59.986 --> 09:14.780
teaching a week before commencement, or a week 
before finals, really. Did you help him to break

09:15.581 --> 09:22.748
him in, Brian?

09:24.213 --> 09:26.001
to a degree, but not that much. He's a very literate 
person.

10:08.071 --> 10:11.495
than the others did. It

10:11.515 --> 10:16.001
worked hard, too. Cooper,

10:16.942 --> 10:22.570
very casual approach to everything. He was 
concerned with time. Ed just wanted to get it out of

10:26.435 --> 10:28.858
there. And rightfully so. The long-winded 
speakers just drove Ed up the wall. Did you

10:35.290 --> 10:39.557
normally sit through all of commencement? Yes. Do 
you remember any of the speakers as special?

10:48.611 --> 10:48.911
Oh, yeah. There's been so many good ones. The only 
ones that really disturbed me And I guess maybe Dr.

10:56.738 --> 11:10.536
Vandiver was the one who did it more than any of the 
rest of them, was they always had at least one

10:56.738 --> 11:10.536
Latino with poor English who just couldn't follow 
them. And they were speaking in very politically

11:10.897 --> 11:20.330
stable or politically correct statements. And it 
was just a position paper. I detest position

11:22.292 --> 11:25.176
papers for commencement addresses. Do you 
remember any incidents on the stage at

11:25.949 --> 11:30.456
commencement, plus or minus? Oh, probably. The 
most hilarious one was a young man came up the steps

11:32.038 --> 11:42.094
on crutches one day, got his diploma, got halfway 
across the stage, put the crutches under his arm,

11:32.038 --> 11:42.094
and ran off the stage. OK. My last commencement to 
attend was the last of the spring commencements 20

11:44.377 --> 11:54.252
years ago in 1980.

11:55.531 --> 12:05.921
And the last person to walk across the stage was a 
young woman in biomedical science named Melanie

11:55.531 --> 12:05.921
Zender. Describe what you recall.

12:12.588 --> 12:14.890
I honestly, Haskell, I did not see it. Brian told me 
about it. As you heard it described by whomever,

12:25.180 --> 12:37.139
That

12:25.180 --> 12:37.139
I heard. That was about two feet from where I was 
seated next to Governor Hobby.

12:45.252 --> 12:53.044
And as I remember it, when she put her hand out, Dr. 
Miller says softly, no way I'm going to shake your

12:45.252 --> 12:53.044
hand. And the crowd kind of gasped. She then turned 
and put out her hand and he said, ma'am, I'm not

12:56.548 --> 13:01.093
involved in this argument. And Don Carter said, 
ma'am, would you please keep the line moving?

13:06.460 --> 13:16.852
Since she was the last of the last of the last 
alphabetically, I learned later that her family

13:06.460 --> 13:16.852
thought we had deliberately staged it so that she 
would be the last. That was not true. No. And when we

13:18.438 --> 13:28.017
got into the Letterman's Lounge, I remember some 
board members saying, serves her right, she's

13:18.438 --> 13:28.017
been a troublemaker, I wouldn't shake her hand 
either. Six weeks later, when Dr. Miller is

13:28.859 --> 13:32.987
dismissed, One of the things that I understand 
they said to him, orally, but they didn't put it in

13:33.895 --> 13:42.152
writing, is, you refuse to shake hands with an 
athlete. Yeah, it was, but I honestly did not see

13:42.673 --> 13:46.400
it. I don't know what I was doing, but I didn't see 
it. All right, how did you get involved in athletic

13:50.629 --> 13:53.254
announcing?

14:03.730 --> 14:13.251
I struck up a friendship with Jim Butler in the 
summer or fall of 1967. And at that time, his duties

14:14.394 --> 14:16.057
were... He was a student. He was a student worker 
for a spec cabin in the athletic department. box

14:25.128 --> 14:33.617
ever came about, I'd really like to do it. I'd like 
to

14:33.798 --> 14:40.685
be busy. And he said, okay. And then in the summer of 
68, uh, they called me for either. He called me.

14:50.542 --> 14:56.392
They had a guy leave the

14:50.542 --> 14:56.392
football. And I wanted to know if I wanted the job. I 
said, sure. So the fall of 68, I was a member of the

15:00.980 --> 15:08.734
statistics crew in the press box for the football 
season. At the end of the season, The guy that was

15:11.534 --> 15:16.401
doing the PA in the press box at that time was a guy 
named Jim O'Connell. C.K. Essin was doing the

15:17.482 --> 15:18.424
field. C.K. Essin was doing the field. They have a 
public address system in the press box. The guy

15:23.911 --> 15:26.074
named Jim O'Connell was doing that. Well, they had 
a couple of playoff games that fall, and he

15:26.675 --> 15:32.203
couldn't make them. And I said, Jim, I'm happy to do 
it. And so I did. Well, then during the basketball

15:37.991 --> 15:41.035
season, But same year, Jim started missing games, 
and every time Jim missed a game, I did it. Well,

15:47.801 --> 16:01.462
then in the fall of 69, they just dropped Jim 
O'Connor completely, and I took over the press box

15:47.801 --> 16:01.462
PA, and I also took over basketball, which I kept 
until 94, I guess. Describe what it was like to work

16:01.482 --> 16:06.830
into the basketball, huh? What were the learning 
experiences?

16:12.875 --> 16:13.917
I don't remember when. I didn't know how.

16:19.788 --> 16:22.613
Did anyone attempt to give you direction? No. 
Everything I've done in public address work, I've

16:24.116 --> 16:27.702
done on my own. I started doing public address work 
for football when I was a junior in high school at

16:28.263 --> 16:34.815
home. We had a bandstand that the band played in at 
the games. And I had a portable PA system that we put

16:41.076 --> 16:45.683
up on that bandstand. And I stood on the bandstand. 
And I did the PA for my high school for two years,

16:47.005 --> 16:56.179
junior and senior year, in 1940, fall of 41 and fall 
of 42. And then I dabbled around whenever I could.

17:03.149 --> 17:08.356
When I was a student at Iowa State, I spotted the 
radio stations on all the home games. The radio

17:08.376 --> 17:15.145
stations would come in, and I worked for the 
athletic department as a spotter, learned to

17:08.376 --> 17:15.145
follow players that way.

17:18.149 --> 17:24.057
When I went to Auburn, their high school had never 
had anybody do their games when I went there. And so

17:24.712 --> 17:30.797
the fall of 63, I did all their high school home 
games. And so I just sort of worked into it. And then

17:33.439 --> 17:35.481
I got into track. And then I got into volleyball. 
Kay Don asked me to come and do a volleyball

17:39.224 --> 17:44.088
tournament match for her one day. And so I kept on 
doing that. Well, that first day, I did a

17:46.290 --> 17:48.372
volleyball match. You talk about the blind 
leading the blind. I didn't know up from down. But I

17:52.075 --> 17:54.617
watched, and I got to where I I knew what was going 
on. Describe, for A&M basketball, describe what

17:58.903 --> 18:07.535
you actually did as the announcer. You didn't give 
the play-by-play, I know that. My concept of

18:11.740 --> 18:20.352
public address announcers, and of course that's 
what got me replaced here in both volleyball and

18:11.740 --> 18:20.352
basketball, is simplicity. And it also created an 
opportunity for me I wouldn't have had otherwise.

18:25.935 --> 18:40.737
When the Southwest Conference started having 
basketball tournaments, they usually used an

18:25.935 --> 18:40.737
announcer who was at the home place.

18:41.830 --> 18:46.836
They moved it to San Antonio in 1980.

18:47.918 --> 18:50.341
And I said something to Bill Morgan. I don't know 
where I happened to see him. I said, Bill, I'll be

18:52.564 --> 18:57.430
happy to do the tournament if you want me to. I'll 
come down and do it for you. He said, gosh, I wish I'd

18:59.873 --> 19:01.515
have known that last year. He said, I'd have had you 
in Houston. And so I went to San Antonio in 1980 and

19:03.143 --> 19:14.104
did the Southwest Conference Tournament, and 
then I did the Southwest Conference Tournament in

19:03.143 --> 19:14.104
81 in San Antonio, and I did the Southwest 
Tournament every year until 1993. Now, you said

19:14.124 --> 19:18.432
simplicity. Define what you meant by simplicity. 
Who does what in a tournament. very stable tone of

19:25.975 --> 19:33.967
voice both ways, and quit.

19:35.089 --> 19:38.494
When did you first turn the mic on for a basketball 
game? At what point in the series of events? I used a

19:42.821 --> 19:46.186
foot lever to operate it. And when somebody scored 
a basket, I pressed it. No, no, no. Back to the

19:49.951 --> 19:52.656
start.

19:53.737 --> 19:54.919
You spoke. Basketball, the only thing... You 
introduced the team? No. Oh, yeah, we introduced

20:02.406 --> 20:04.408
the teams in basketball, yeah. We introduced the 
teams. And asked people to stand for the national

20:06.791 --> 20:10.094
anthem. Yes, that's... And what else? That's 
about it. In early years, we introduced the

20:16.300 --> 20:20.164
officials, and then we quit doing that. About 84, 
85, along in there. All right, make believe that I

20:25.072 --> 20:28.898
had never been to a game in G. Raleigh White. 
Describe in its heyday a basketball in G. Raleigh

20:29.359 --> 20:37.172
White under the longtime basketball coach of 
those years here.

20:43.343 --> 20:43.683
It was...

20:47.790 --> 20:50.134
The funny thing with Shelby's teams... He had 
teams that would play very, very poorly against

20:51.211 --> 21:02.109
teams they should beat the tar out of, and then play 
very, very well against somebody who should have

20:51.211 --> 21:02.109
beat the tar out of him. I had an advantage in 
basketball here. I also refereed practically

21:10.448 --> 21:22.068
every scrimmage Shelby had from 1966

21:10.448 --> 21:22.068
until my legs quit in 86. For 20 years, I refereed 
every scrimmage he had. The guys knew me, and I knew

21:25.994 --> 21:28.218
them, and he knew me. So I was part of the action. 
Now, Shelby was the head coach when you got here.

21:36.292 --> 21:36.372
Yes.

21:40.030 --> 21:42.373
The relationships I've had with Shelby were 
really good. We were never really close. It was a

21:44.876 --> 21:48.682
very warm relationship. And when he found out that 
I'd been replaced, he was really upset. He was

21:53.368 --> 22:09.970
really upset because he didn't...

21:53.368 --> 22:09.970
What kind of crowds came to games in those days? All 
off. Started. Well, but wait and go back before the

22:15.765 --> 22:26.864
fall off.

22:30.230 --> 22:31.933
Don't forget Arkansas. We're slick. It 
understood. And I want. One of the most

22:37.000 --> 22:53.125
interesting comments I ever got out of Arkansas, 
and it was

22:37.000 --> 22:53.125
who is now the head coach at the University of 
Nevada, Reno.

22:54.287 --> 22:57.852
They came in one night, and I went up and talked to 
Pat. I said, well, I'm so glad to see you guys.

23:10.885 --> 23:30.589
And then only

23:10.885 --> 23:30.589
a year or so later, Pat was gone by that time, but we 
played Arkansas in the finals at San Antonio the

23:10.885 --> 23:30.589
first year I was down there. And I was really 
concerned on Saturday that Eddie would fuss about

23:30.609 --> 23:36.897
me doing a game. He never said a word. And it was even 
more amusing because after the game was over, I

23:41.075 --> 23:59.944
went in the locker room and said, speak to Steve 
Sillis, Steve and Dave, a couple of the

23:41.075 --> 23:59.944
guys. Am I not correct that during that era, those 
of us in the stands, when you would start to

23:59.964 --> 24:08.938
introduce the A&M team, that we would yell so 
loudly to your voice that sometimes Eddie would

24:09.121 --> 24:19.820
get mad? I have no answer to that. I don't know. 
Because I remember one, and what we'd do is drown

24:24.848 --> 24:30.538
you out where you couldn't be heard.

24:33.117 --> 24:51.261
threw it down and it during the game to cool off what 
are some memories here what are some high points

24:33.117 --> 24:51.261
and low points in your memory some games that you 
remember most

24:58.852 --> 25:09.685
I was sitting down on the floor at the far end, and I 
didn't see any of it other than the fact that I saw

24:58.852 --> 25:09.685
the start when... This was the guy from... Billy 
Bob?

25:20.778 --> 25:22.260
No, it was Perrette.

25:30.458 --> 25:34.186
I couldn't see anything. I was disappointed

25:34.787 --> 25:42.522
in Stalling's handling of it afterwards. I 
thought he defended some people who didn't

25:42.663 --> 25:46.290
warrant defense. But that's another thing. Gene 
Stallings is also probably the best friend I've

25:48.991 --> 25:51.775
had here. And I was so, so pleased that they finally 
honored him last spring with a distinguished

25:53.137 --> 26:01.329
alumnus, because he certainly earned it.

26:06.817 --> 26:08.420
Well, one was at Houston. That was before I was 
doing a PA, but that Houston game was one of them.

26:14.283 --> 26:29.423
the other high the highest other point probably 
was shelby went in the southwest conference

26:14.283 --> 26:29.423
tournament with a team that finished last in the 
big southwest conference those kids went they

26:14.283 --> 26:29.423
didn't he he only had one basketball player in that 
whole bunch that was winston kreit And the rest of

26:29.757 --> 26:31.959
them were just guys named Joe. And they just played 
their hearts out and then beat a pretty decent

26:32.680 --> 26:40.189
Baylor team solidly to win the championship. And 
that, I think, was really as high a point as I've

26:40.269 --> 26:44.914
seen. Because here was a bunch of guys that, in 
fact, it was Shelby himself. He didn't even take a

26:48.438 --> 26:51.321
change of clothes to Dallas with him. Because TCU 
had won the conference, and that was the first

26:53.964 --> 26:57.368
opponent. Well, they ended up beating them by 
about six points or something like that, and then I

26:57.348 --> 27:02.838
think they beat Texas Tech in the second round. 
Then they have Baylor, who had a pretty darn good

27:03.219 --> 27:07.627
team, and they just absolutely squashed Baylor. 
That was really an astonishing thing. And then, of

27:15.843 --> 27:25.118
course, some of the things that Tony achieved in 
his first couple of years here were good also. Tony

27:26.420 --> 27:29.064
Maloney? Yes. What was the little guy's name?

27:36.096 --> 27:36.596
Tony. But he was really a fire plug. And they won 
some games that they shouldn't have won, and they

27:39.113 --> 27:45.884
really played hard. I really felt sorry for Tony 
that things turned the way they did, because he

27:46.745 --> 27:53.916
really tried hard, but nothing worked. Just 
nothing worked. If you look back over all those

27:55.579 --> 28:05.695
games and various athletic events that you 
witnessed, how do you think your faith I'm not

28:08.493 --> 28:10.135
going to ask the negative. Who were your favorite 
individual athletes? Oh, start with Randy

28:12.839 --> 28:14.321
Mattson.

28:16.885 --> 28:17.666
Why Randy? Yeah, just because what he did, when he 
did it, with what he did, no one up to this point that

28:17.686 --> 28:36.812
I know of has thrown, and maybe somebody did this 
spring, has thrown a shot put as far as he did

28:17.686 --> 28:36.812
without chemical assistance. And he was the 
first, and he was a super guy. I

28:43.426 --> 28:51.514
can't think of any other brothers. The one from 
Snook, Stanley Kerr. I remember telling the

28:57.460 --> 29:01.905
superintendent there, Don, uh names are falling 
out of place now but i thought when kerr was a

29:02.290 --> 29:26.391
freshman here i said tell tell leslie that those 
feet are his way out of the wilderness he's getting

29:02.290 --> 29:26.391
an opportunity and probably through back through 
all of the things that i've had involved with in

29:02.290 --> 29:26.391
athletics the one i'm probably the most gratified 
and proud of In 1955, I was practicing veterinary

29:26.725 --> 29:33.855
medicine in the little town of Ida Grove, Iowa, in 
northwest Iowa. One of my clients had a son who was a

29:34.536 --> 29:38.141
senior in high school. And I went out there one 
morning and he said, Leo's running a track meet and

29:39.563 --> 29:45.952
posting this afternoon. He said, if you can, go 
see. So I did. I took the afternoon off and went up.

29:53.362 --> 29:54.724
He's running in a mile run.

30:24.168 --> 30:37.368
And

30:24.168 --> 30:37.368
his dad said, oh, Leo can't go to Iowa State. He was 
going to a high school that had 35 students in it.

30:40.473 --> 30:43.217
And they were tenant farmers, and they didn't have 
anything. And I said, well, go and see.

30:54.762 --> 31:05.418
a junior as a sophomore, junior, and senior, and 
ended up in his he won three letters in cross

30:54.762 --> 31:05.418
country, three letters track, and two letters the 
indoor track. Was captain of the cross country

31:05.718 --> 31:08.121
team his senior year. Two months ago, he retired

31:10.064 --> 31:17.395
having gone and been there for 29 years with a PhD in 
exercise physiology.
