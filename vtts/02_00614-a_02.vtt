WEBVTT

00:01.988 --> 00:03.691
Rather, where the record has not been disturbed. 
Yes, I'm sorry, where the record has not been

00:03.711 --> 00:05.673
disturbed. Yes, that is true in a sense.

00:14.146 --> 00:22.999
What we've been trying to do in our group is to 
establish phenomena as a function of time, the

00:14.146 --> 00:22.999
record of the past history. Okay, then what are 
some of the things you've discovered then which

00:23.720 --> 00:30.510
have modified beliefs about, let's say, the 
origin of the oceans?

00:33.663 --> 01:03.214
Well,

00:33.663 --> 01:03.214
anything that we've done that has a bearing on that 
subject

00:33.663 --> 01:03.214
is most closely associated with this question 
that lies much further back in time, the question

00:33.663 --> 01:03.214
of how matter originally formed, how solid matter 
originally formed in the solar system. And those

01:04.325 --> 01:14.355
questions decide essentially where the water 
eventually came from that later on formed the

01:04.325 --> 01:14.355
ocean. So

01:14.375 --> 01:23.083
in that field, it's very hard to make any really 
breakthroughs or major discoveries. You

01:23.243 --> 01:31.311
work with little details in the record that is very 
scanty. so limited that it's open for many

01:32.253 --> 01:35.318
different interpretations. And what you can do is 
to essentially see how this record fits with the

01:36.379 --> 01:48.417
actual observations of reality today. The field 
is very full of speculation. And

01:52.183 --> 01:59.053
there are many people very interested in the 
question of the earliest history of the solar

01:52.183 --> 01:59.053
system. What characterizes much of this work is 
that it's split up between people in different

02:01.244 --> 02:15.425
fields, chemists, physicists, geologists, who 
work kind of separately on these things. And each

02:16.246 --> 02:27.302
one of them have a theory for the origin of the solar 
system, one for chemists, another one for

02:16.246 --> 02:27.302
physicists, a third one for geologists. And they 
are rather, since there's strangely enough

02:31.282 --> 02:59.263
little contact between them

02:31.282 --> 02:59.263
it's very rare that these different theories are 
confronted with each other and people find that

02:31.282 --> 02:59.263
there are where geologists thought some things 
were possible or likely physical laws of how

02:31.282 --> 02:59.263
matter behaves in space prohibit that and negates 
such a theory and what I've been interested in

02:31.282 --> 02:59.263
essentially is to work together with, try to join 
information of the type that I'm particularly

03:00.239 --> 03:11.810
interested in with the information that can come 
from other fields. And the collaboration that I

03:12.030 --> 03:25.443
have particularly treasured and learned much 
from is with the outstanding physicist professor

03:12.030 --> 03:25.443
Hannes Alvén. And together we have tried to 
develop some, I wouldn't even call it theories,

03:30.665 --> 03:56.115
but a framework for the permitted range of 
interpretations of the past history of the solar

03:30.665 --> 03:56.115
system on the basis of the boundaries of the limits 
that are imposed by physical and chemical laws,

03:30.665 --> 03:56.115
essentially.

03:56.135 --> 03:59.659
That is essentially the contribution as far as I 
see it in that particular field.

04:10.877 --> 04:17.464
Exactly what is the framework around which you 
sketch, let's say, the origin of the universe?

04:18.205 --> 04:22.730
That is a very interesting philosophical 
question. There again, there are very different

04:22.750 --> 04:26.454
departures taken by different people through 
time. One is that very commonly that you have a

04:31.955 --> 05:00.493
brilliant idea of some kind you're fascinated by 
some specific phenomenon and you say wouldn't it

04:31.955 --> 05:00.493
be interesting to see if you can use that to explain 
a specific phenomenon to explain things in the

04:31.955 --> 05:00.493
past

04:31.955 --> 05:00.493
I think what one finds is generally that human 
knowledge and human human rationalization is

04:31.955 --> 05:00.493
very very limited And if you base your approach to 
the history of the past on speculations without

05:01.688 --> 05:14.839
contact with reality, then you're bound. Even if 
you're very smart, after a few steps, the chances

05:14.920 --> 05:22.326
that you'll go wrong is very, very high. This is the 
basis of existentialism, essentially. And I'm an

05:25.529 --> 05:26.670
existentialist. Therefore, I think that 
scientists, as well as other human beings need

05:32.182 --> 05:37.026
very badly to be guided by reality. And the reality 
in this case is the situation. If you're

05:43.251 --> 05:51.979
interested in the conditions in space in the past, 
then you have to ask yourself, what are the

05:43.251 --> 05:51.979
processes going on in space today? What are the 
laws that govern the motion and state of matter in

05:51.999 --> 05:57.884
space today? And there, of course, a whole new that 
we didn't know very much at all 20 years ago. All

06:05.961 --> 06:10.867
kinds of beliefs then prevailed that are 
completely obsolete today. People thought that

06:11.848 --> 06:30.893
this interstellar space was a void, near vacuum,

06:11.848 --> 06:30.893
whereas now one knows it's a thin medium that is 
strongly electrified like northern lights,

06:11.848 --> 06:30.893
roughly, full of a network of currents and 
magnetic fields. In the same way, the chemical

06:33.168 --> 06:49.602
ideas about interplanetary and interstellar 
space in olden days was one of

06:33.168 --> 06:49.602
such a nothingness and in between clouds of gas. 
These gases were believed to be behaviors like

06:49.823 --> 06:54.667
gases in the laboratory on Earth. That one is 
commonly used. And this is where the space

06:57.609 --> 07:02.854
exploration opened up a completely new new 
experimental field demonstrated how completely

07:03.610 --> 07:07.494
wrong people were. That instead of neutral gases 
dominating the picture, you find that

07:08.295 --> 07:25.115
just very small degrees of ionization in these 
gases cause them to behave fundamentally

07:08.295 --> 07:25.115
differently from the ordinary gas dynamics laws. 
And it's the laws of plasma physics and the laws of

07:25.755 --> 07:33.364
magneto-hydrodynamics that govern the behavior 
of matter in space. And this is where I felt that

07:33.783 --> 08:00.347
collaboration with Professor Alvén was 
particularly informative

07:33.783 --> 08:00.347
for me, because he is one of the founders of the 
modern science of magnetohydrodynamics, and one

07:33.783 --> 08:00.347
of the pioneers in the understanding of how things 
actually behave in space,

08:01.913 --> 08:05.559
in a way that's based on speculation, but in a way 
that's based on observation.

08:08.263 --> 08:11.548
Is US spending enough money on its space program?

08:14.673 --> 08:16.756
That is very hard to say. I think the space program 
consists and has consisted of two things, science

08:16.816 --> 08:30.317
and public relations in the international arena. 
And for example, the lunar program, the manned

08:31.833 --> 08:50.121
landings on the moon, were entirely, I think the 
justification politically for it, were not the

08:31.833 --> 08:50.121
advancement of science. Science got a free ride 
there on the publicity stunt undertaken at a very

08:51.583 --> 08:59.916
grandiose scale by the United States. to impress 
the world with what is possible with modern

09:00.622 --> 09:04.667
technology.

09:07.731 --> 09:24.391
And

09:07.731 --> 09:24.391
in that program, science in the beginning was

09:07.731 --> 09:24.391
perhaps not thought of as the major purpose. It 
became quite well-funded during the great era

09:24.411 --> 09:30.358
when this played an important role in the eyes of 
the world. The problem with such a background for

09:34.831 --> 10:00.377
scientific support is that when the publicity 
interest has dropped, people's attention span is

09:34.831 --> 10:00.377
very short, then that tends also to be a dropping 
interest in political support for scientific

09:34.831 --> 10:00.377
work in the field. And this is where at the present 
time, where there is needed to carry on a sustained

10:01.608 --> 10:30.383
exploration of space around us, not just for 
publicity, or not only for philosophical

10:01.608 --> 10:30.383
reasons, to express it in a more favorable way, but 
also for the understanding of nature and of the

10:01.608 --> 10:30.383
processes that ultimately have to do with 
everyday life on Earth. Do you judge NASA to be too

10:30.768 --> 10:33.653
mission-oriented? NASA has to be very 
mission-oriented, because the great

10:35.135 --> 10:42.427
breakthroughs that NASA has made are due to 
missions. So not at all. No, I think that is the

10:45.272 --> 10:51.963
lifeblood of modern space science, is actual 
expeditions into space. They don't need to be

10:53.465 --> 10:56.370
manned, and some of the more exciting 
explorations will be probably undertaken in the

10:57.312 --> 11:03.521
near future by unmanned spacecraft. The orbiting 
space station around the moon, the polar orbiter

11:03.802 --> 11:26.475
that is hoped for, and

11:03.802 --> 11:26.475
parallelly, I would hope, the exploration of 
comets and asteroids, small bodies in the solar

11:03.802 --> 11:26.475
system, which hold the secret to the origin of the 
solar system, in contrast to the planets and the

11:26.894 --> 11:33.180
moon that can't give any information about that. 
Why do comments hold the secret to the solar

11:33.200 --> 11:36.584
system? Well, I think it generally agreed on that 
the solar system formed from gas and dust, but

11:37.404 --> 11:54.201
perhaps hasn't dawned on everybody yet the state 
that this gas and dust was in and what specific laws

11:54.923 --> 12:00.248
that follow when they form, but the general 
understanding is there. And when such gas and dust

12:01.750 --> 12:23.952
clumps up together to form clumps of larger and 
larger size that grow and eventually form bodies

12:01.750 --> 12:23.952
as large as planets, the gravitation is so strong 
and the forces become so strong in these bodies

12:01.750 --> 12:23.952
that they destroy their original record. The 
Earth has destroyed totally the record of the

12:25.096 --> 12:32.444
structure and composition of the original 
material it was made from. It has remelted itself

12:32.464 --> 12:42.796
and is continuing to remelt its crust, at least, 
and spew out the remelted rocks as volcanic

12:32.464 --> 12:42.796
eruptions. The same on any big planets, like 
Venus. Mars is kind of halfway through that

12:49.344 --> 12:51.486
process. It is more youthful, maybe, than the 
Earth. all of the original material is certainly

12:55.640 --> 12:58.243
totally destroyed. And any time you land some 
little chunk of original material on such a big

12:58.263 --> 13:08.796
body, just because it smashes into the surface so 
hard, it is destroyed. Unless you have an

13:09.557 --> 13:16.246
atmosphere like the Earth, that makes it possible 
for meteorites to have soft landing. So the bodies

13:16.967 --> 13:23.655
then that haven't grown big enough to destroy this 
material The small planets, the minor planets,

13:24.226 --> 13:45.868
the so-called asteroids that cruise around 
mostly in orbit in space, mostly between Mars and

13:24.226 --> 13:45.868
Jupiter, and also the comets that have come from 
way out in the outer reaches of the solar system and

13:24.226 --> 13:45.868
come in close to the sun and go back out again. 
There's quite a lot of evidence that they consist

13:45.888 --> 13:52.174
of material that has been very little altered from 
its original state. What is information science,

13:55.872 --> 14:01.317
by the way? Information science is everything 
that has to do with modern computers, data, data

14:01.337 --> 14:07.523
processing. Okay. Well, what relationship does 
information science have to do with your work?

14:16.371 --> 14:21.756
It's only a tool in all modern science, or in much of 
modern science. You are aided very much by

14:22.259 --> 14:32.132
computers and by the whole science that is behind 
computers. But it's not only the everyday . It's a

14:37.239 --> 14:50.477
question of signal processing, the way you convey 
information in an electromechanical sense and

14:37.239 --> 14:50.477
also in the widest sense. information by 
communication between people. And what have you

14:56.888 --> 15:05.361
tried to do as associate director of the Institute 
for Pure and Applied Physical Sciences? Well,

15:05.862 --> 15:16.038
that institute is essentially an outgrowth of the 
original Institute for the Study of Matter under

15:05.862 --> 15:16.038
Professor Mathias' direction. By merging with 
some other similarly oriented organizations,

15:20.073 --> 15:44.144
essentially this Institute for Pure and Applied 
Physical Sciences, originally created by

15:20.073 --> 15:44.144
Professor Keith Bruckner, one of our great 
physicists on this campus and our international

15:20.073 --> 15:44.144
team, joined together with the Institute for 
Study of Matter and formed this new structure. And

15:44.645 --> 15:50.012
what I've been doing there is partly to to try to 
draw together into that type of, the different

15:51.410 --> 16:09.250
types of research efforts that were going on in 
that field on this campus and to assist

15:51.410 --> 16:09.250
essentially in the effort by Professor Mathias in 
doing that. Okay, and when you say draw together

16:09.270 --> 16:16.579
the different kinds of research going on on this 
campus, do you mean draw together the different

16:09.270 --> 16:16.579
kinds of research on this campus and apply it to 
space? There is not, well, so much in space

16:20.857 --> 16:21.959
sciences. In this case, it's mostly in material 
science. It's a material science effort that is

16:26.325 --> 16:34.996
handled by that

16:26.325 --> 16:34.996
institute.

16:35.237 --> 16:44.890
Is it possible to, let's say, harness that 
enthusiasm that appeared for the original space

16:35.237 --> 16:44.890
program and turn it towards the oceans?

16:47.890 --> 16:49.932
How do you mean, in Washington? In Washington and 
with the general public. I don't see why one

16:54.638 --> 16:56.179
should. It's like saying you should,

16:56.279 --> 17:13.999
well, to turn the interest, the legitimate 
profound interest in one field of science into the

16:56.279 --> 17:13.999
equally legitimate and interesting work in 
another field of science. There's no reason why

17:15.008 --> 17:17.190
one should be converted into another. They're 
both justified on their own and tie in with each

17:17.250 --> 17:20.994
other. But there's only so much of a pool, let's 
say, of research monies available to the academic

17:22.015 --> 17:30.003
world. Do you feel as if, as a man who operates in 
both fields, may I put you on the spot here, do you

17:30.023 --> 17:41.674
feel as if we should continue with space as a major 
priority, or should the major priority become

17:41.992 --> 17:44.195
oceans, or should we have no major priority? Oh, I 
think we are far from the point where the amount of

17:44.555 --> 17:59.775
funds going into science, fundamental and 
applied science in this country, are limited by

17:44.555 --> 17:59.775
the resources of this nation. I mean, it's just to 
compare the magnitudes. The amount that went into

18:04.882 --> 18:11.931
the space program during its heydays was really 
costing money because of the tremendous

18:04.882 --> 18:11.931
engineering efforts. That amount is less than 
people spend on smoking in the United States per

18:13.278 --> 18:20.745
year, and less than spent on cosmetics every year. 
It's nothing compared to the Greengrass National

18:21.466 --> 18:32.597
Project, compared to what is spent on armament and 
weapons. It's a very, very small fraction. And

18:34.739 --> 18:40.905
that, yet, was the largest effort in science at 
that time. the other branches of science, is a

18:41.375 --> 18:45.720
small fraction of that again. So this country is 
devoting a very small fraction of its gross

18:46.862 --> 19:05.644
national product to the creation of new 
knowledge, which is essential for the future of

18:46.862 --> 19:05.644
the nation.

19:08.138 --> 19:13.604
That leads me to another series of questions, 
which I'd like you to make invidious comparisons,

19:08.138 --> 19:13.604
if you don't mind. I'm happy to make invidious 
comparisons. All right. Vis-a-vis, let's say,

19:17.669 --> 19:24.677
your original home of Scandinavia, how would you 
rank American scientific efforts? Does one

19:25.017 --> 19:30.984
receive a better or a worse education in 
Scandinavia in terms of the sciences as a

19:25.017 --> 19:30.984
professional? That's a very broad, it's like 
saying our earthlings better or worse than

19:35.290 --> 19:36.792
Martians. I think it's

19:38.955 --> 20:02.867
easy to speak about the education you receive or 
scientific training you receive in Sweden or in

19:38.955 --> 20:02.867
Norway or in Denmark because these are small, 
homogeneous societies which

19:38.955 --> 20:02.867
correspond in size, in geographic size, to 
California, for example, in Sweden.

20:04.889 --> 20:10.956
where you have, therefore, rather unified 
structures in education. In the United States,

20:11.516 --> 20:13.318
that's a continent. You have an enormous variety 
of standards and of institutions ranking from

20:13.398 --> 20:24.190
completely worthless to the most outstanding in 
the world. And the great institutions in this

20:25.231 --> 20:30.036
country are unparalleled anywhere in the world. 
What about work and activity in, let's say,

20:31.568 --> 20:35.011
oceanography? First, would you estimate that the 
United States is on par with, let's say, the

20:36.172 --> 20:51.506
oceanographic institutions of the other 
affluent countries in terms of science? Let's say

20:51.526 --> 20:56.230
Germany, the Soviet Union, and the Scandinavian 
countries. I would say in each of these groups, and

21:01.505 --> 21:07.073
particularly the ones, the wealthier nations 
that are so large that they can afford a massive

21:01.505 --> 21:07.073
effort. Scandinavian countries don't belong 
there. Their effort in these expensive fields

21:10.357 --> 21:26.679
must necessarily be limited and spotty, limited 
to certain periods of time when there's a giant

21:10.357 --> 21:26.679
effort, like in the 1880s or in the 1940s during the 
great expeditions that were undertaken then. In

21:27.540 --> 21:29.723
the United States and in the USSR, Germany, 
France, there can be sustained efforts. And the

21:34.479 --> 21:42.246
sustained effort in the United States is 
undergoing a very strong change right now. In the

21:43.087 --> 21:50.053
USSR, it is continuing in the traditional way. And 
in the USSR, everything is very structured.

21:58.661 --> 22:00.503
The effort that has gone into has been very 
extensive. Their ships are just perfect,

22:06.199 --> 22:10.423
excellent ships. If not designed for the purpose 
or selected, ships are selected for the purpose

22:11.644 --> 22:23.955
that are very expensive to roam, that serve the 
purpose very well, that makes it possible for

22:11.644 --> 22:23.955
people to stay at sea for very long times. The 
Russian ships are roaming all the portions of the

22:24.936 --> 22:30.000
sea and people stay out for very long times. In the 
United States, I would say the effort is probably

22:31.010 --> 22:43.364
much more imaginative. But from the point of view 
of ships facilities, one has depended on the Navy

22:45.347 --> 23:00.004
essentially during the initial era, during the 
40s and 50s and 60s.

23:03.545 --> 23:26.717
The ships have characteristically either been 
local donations by some millionaire who wanted to

23:03.545 --> 23:26.717
get rid of a yacht, and in the better cases, ships 
placed at disposal by the U.S. Navy, but that have

23:03.545 --> 23:26.717
to be on call all the time, and therefore could not 
be modified for their original use, turgs, rescue

23:03.545 --> 23:26.717
vessels, things like that. We've also, so that has 
marred the efficiency of the US oceanographic

23:32.806 --> 23:34.068
fleet. Then there's been a period during which 
ships, some of the ships, were designed actually

23:35.830 --> 23:42.860
for oceanographic purposes. But my regard for 
most of these designers is not very high.

23:53.795 --> 23:59.843
The

23:53.795 --> 23:59.843
results are not really vessels that are 
characterized by the utmost in modern

24:00.312 --> 24:11.307
engineering and skill, but rather, I mean, some of 
them rather amateurishly done and become rather

24:00.312 --> 24:11.307
rapidly outdated. Many of them have low speeds and 
therefore can't achieve so much at any given time.

24:20.860 --> 24:27.889
And also I think the Puritan aspect of the American 
society prevents the creation on board of

24:29.202 --> 24:43.738
comfortable quarters for the crew and for the 
scientific crew and for the

24:29.202 --> 24:43.738
sailors and officers, it somehow goes against the 
grain. People should be comfortable on board. As a

24:46.722 --> 24:58.315
result, in contrast, for example, on the Russian 
ship, people live in great luxury, but in great

24:46.722 --> 24:58.315
comfort.

24:59.341 --> 25:05.808
That, I think, has... As a result of that, you can 
never keep people on board on the macro ship for a

24:59.341 --> 25:05.808
long time. As a result, you have to fly them out to 
wherever to change crew all the time, every six

25:06.168 --> 25:14.117
weeks or so, and it becomes very, very costly to 
exchange crews. And also, to keep morale high on

25:16.019 --> 25:27.171
board is very difficult because of the rather 
limited comfort and... That is deplorable in a

25:28.889 --> 25:30.512
way. How many oceanographic voyages have you 
made? Oh, I've lost track of them. Nowadays, I go

25:36.845 --> 25:38.708
out very rarely. But the major expeditions 
lasting for some considerable time, half a dozen

25:40.692 --> 25:48.788
or so.
