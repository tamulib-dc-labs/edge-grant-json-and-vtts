WEBVTT

00:11.810 --> 00:22.287
Yeah, well, to respond to that question,

00:11.810 --> 00:22.287
I don't think I labored on it. I don't think it was in 
any particularly anomalous position. I know that

00:26.614 --> 00:36.450
Islin really didn't understand or particularly 
value theoretical work. I think some of the

00:37.814 --> 00:51.792
activity that I did during that period, like some 
of the field programs I tried to carry out, were in

00:37.814 --> 00:51.792
response to trying to please him.

00:53.173 --> 01:03.366
But he was very suspicious of any kind of 
theoretical work at all. I guess that maybe

01:04.848 --> 01:09.155
Walter's recollection of the times or something. 
Maybe sometimes I felt a little bit hemmed in and

01:09.876 --> 01:20.533
prevented by the one-man structure of the 
institution that we had at that time. Felt a little

01:21.254 --> 01:25.901
bit hemmed in and restricted in things that I could 
do. Maybe thought, you know, I didn't have right

01:26.302 --> 01:32.391
access to the ship time or wasn't sufficiently 
appreciated or didn't get enough support or

01:26.302 --> 01:32.391
something like that. I think, I think people can 
think those things. I don't think it was very

01:36.647 --> 01:48.762
serious and I think, I think I probably did feel 
that way with Islam more than with Admiral Smith,

01:36.647 --> 01:48.762
who

01:36.647 --> 01:48.762
I think was very supportive. But it was really, 
really often the trouble is not, the trouble is, is

01:48.782 --> 01:59.796
that

02:00.940 --> 02:12.602
is developing a program clearly enough and 
specifically enough so that other people can

02:00.940 --> 02:12.602
understand it and can then begin to help support 
you to do it. If you're struggling around in a kind

02:12.642 --> 02:17.852
of mental fog yourself, And you don't get very much 
support on the outside. That's really not the

02:22.363 --> 02:26.067
other people's fault, it seems to me. Well, you may 
think so. It's more your own limitation.

02:33.836 --> 02:45.730
Basically, it seems to me that everything that one 
could conceive of that was reasonably decent and

02:33.836 --> 02:45.730
communicable eventually eventually happens, 
maybe not, maybe not right away. I think Gislin

02:50.537 --> 02:54.682
didn't support me very much in the Bermuda work. I 
think that was a bad period for me, 53, 54. And,

03:00.088 --> 03:10.941
but he probably had some pretty good reasons, 
can't argue against.

03:20.911 --> 03:35.046
It would be interesting to know what the

03:20.911 --> 03:35.046
size of the early grants were in the first three 
years when I was at Harvard. They probably were

03:35.066 --> 03:44.556
something like $50,000

03:35.066 --> 03:44.556
a year or something like that, I suspect.

03:49.953 --> 04:06.009
because

03:49.953 --> 04:06.009
I think I was probably, I wasn't paying part

03:49.953 --> 04:06.009
of the salary, but I think it was probably, it must 
have been something

03:49.953 --> 04:06.009
in that order. What prompted you to move to 
Harvard? Oh, temptation. It was a very foolish

04:09.973 --> 04:16.500
thing to do, I think. I think perhaps the, I, when I 
was, when I, I enjoyed my time at Yale very much. I

04:24.338 --> 04:25.960
was there some seven years. I liked the academic 
life there very much. And although when I came to

04:29.124 --> 04:44.682
Woods Hole, I found Woods Hole a very nice place to 
be for the whole 16 years that I was there,

04:29.124 --> 04:44.682
it seemed to me there was sort of something 
missing.

04:45.927 --> 05:01.008
There's a narrowness to a purely scientific

04:45.927 --> 05:01.008
institution that you notice if you have been in a 
place where before you could talk to lawyers

04:45.927 --> 05:01.008
or historians. It's a very distinct process. And 
so when I got this chance to go to Harvard, I really

05:03.031 --> 05:14.247
didn't really want to do it very much, but then I 
eventually did do it. And of course, it's a very big

05:14.952 --> 05:33.420
university, and the place, the laboratory where 
my offices were, were

05:14.952 --> 05:33.420
completely

05:14.952 --> 05:33.420
immersed in engineering and physics. In fact, the 
club is very big, and it would take half a lifetime

05:33.440 --> 05:40.470
to develop contacts with the historians and 
artists and so forth. any

05:42.155 --> 05:59.612
kind of a fuzz play. So it's

05:59.632 --> 06:08.561
kind of an impossible thing to recover some kind of 
an experience of that kind, I think, at least in the

05:59.632 --> 06:08.561
art of fuzz. It might not be Cambridge England or 
something of that sort. I think that was part of the

06:09.802 --> 06:10.963
reason I think probably a large, large, large 
fraction of the region. Also, I'd had, I'd had some

06:17.383 --> 06:35.314
nice contacts with some of the people there, 
George Carrier in particular was a very

06:17.383 --> 06:35.314
successful, I guess I shared the

06:17.383 --> 06:35.314
supervision of of Alan Robertson's PhD thesis, 
which was

06:35.851 --> 06:59.368
a, mine was a pretty nice one, and so I suddenly got 
the idea that there were

06:35.851 --> 06:59.368
going to be some

06:35.851 --> 06:59.368
interesting students and people to talk to about 
how to work with, and professionally. So that's

06:59.388 --> 07:03.715
what I, that's what I did. I think it probably in the 
long run was kind of a mistake because I think it

07:04.538 --> 07:21.741
moved me too far away from work at sea and contact 
with ships

07:04.538 --> 07:21.741
and so forth. I mean, if you compare my career to 
someone else's who's been single-mindedly

07:21.761 --> 07:28.690
devoted to working at sea, Like some of the people 
in Wetzel, or like Swallow, for example, in

07:28.940 --> 07:35.769
England. It's conspicuous and different. It must 
have been 5% or 10% of the time that they are doing

07:37.411 --> 07:42.738
the work at sea. It might have been that way anyway, 
but I think going to Harvard and MIT was a sure way to

07:42.758 --> 07:53.533
end up that way. Did you go to sea often? Not a great 
deal, but I mean, I could see that the, certainly

07:55.619 --> 08:18.133
more than now, and I think,

07:55.619 --> 08:18.133
I think that might have been a, that was a dividing 
point, a fork in the road, so to speak, and I think it

07:55.619 --> 08:18.133
would have been interesting to see what it might 
have done if I'd taken the other, the other fork in

07:55.619 --> 08:18.133
the road.

08:27.985 --> 08:29.927
Now you say Harvard and MIT. Yeah, well, I'm in MIT 
now. That's right. When did you decide to make the

08:32.811 --> 08:37.056
move from Harvard to MIT? In 1963.

08:42.423 --> 08:56.440
And I think

08:42.423 --> 08:56.440
I felt very lonely in Harvard.

08:58.360 --> 09:00.543
Yeah, I guess I felt very isolated over there. And 
in fact, all my, well, I guess what really happened

09:00.563 --> 09:14.979
was I went to, before I went to Harvard, I was 
working as a kind of adjunct professor at MIT for at

09:00.563 --> 09:14.979
least one year. I think it was one year. And so I'd 
known all the people at MIT for a long time, Don

09:17.202 --> 09:25.752
Phillips and Joe Charney and Victor Starr. When I 
went to, when I went over to Harvard full time,

09:27.436 --> 09:38.728
there were only a couple of people there that I 
really knew. And all the people in the Cambridge

09:38.908 --> 09:44.194
area that I knew were at MIT. So I began to feel kind 
of, I began to feel kind of funny. And I began to

09:49.720 --> 09:54.025
question my motives for going to Harvard. To what 
degree it was snobbish and things like that. to

09:55.972 --> 09:58.616
which a large extent it is. It's a game which is 
played, I think, quite a lot. Everybody tells each

10:02.982 --> 10:05.245
other how good they are. It gets pretty clawing 
after a while. So, anyway, it seemed kind of funny

10:08.210 --> 10:23.152
to be over there with all my real contacts and 
friends for quite a few years, eight years or

10:08.210 --> 10:23.152
so, over at MIT. And so, you know, I didn't... And it 
wasn't a very hard decision for me, which I think

10:26.600 --> 10:36.441
was really a better thing for me to do. It's a very 
business-like, sensible, realistic place. And

10:43.395 --> 11:02.466
in the early days I was first there, I had quite a bit 
of support from the Draper Laboratory, which was

10:43.395 --> 11:02.466
connected with MIT at that time, which helped some 
graduate students through some instrumental and

10:43.395 --> 11:02.466
observational kind of programs. There was no 
counterpart to that at that time. I don't remember

11:06.222 --> 11:24.917
how many, but probably five

11:06.222 --> 11:24.917
or six graduate students who were profited very 
much by the fact that they were able to do this. It

11:24.937 --> 11:25.458
was a supporting group. They were especially 
technical. They helped people build things and

11:26.239 --> 11:27.241
design things. Otherwise, we probably couldn't 
have done it. That kind of function, I think, now is

11:29.797 --> 11:48.256
somewhat diminished at MIT on account of the fact 
that MIT divested

11:29.797 --> 11:48.256
itself

11:29.797 --> 11:48.256
of the Draybill Laboratory as a result of student 
unrest. And so later students now don't have that

11:48.276 --> 11:51.259
quite the same opportunity they had before. And 
also, but we still have some kind of coordination.

11:57.265 --> 11:57.745
Carl, why don't you?

12:03.682 --> 12:25.908
but on a more, less

12:03.682 --> 12:25.908
on a student basis,

12:03.682 --> 12:25.908
more

12:03.682 --> 12:25.908
on a project basis. In other words, the people at 
the Draper Laboratory aren't helping individual

12:25.928 --> 12:28.211
students with individual projects. It's a big 
project, and students can get some kind of work

12:28.231 --> 12:31.815
done, but their primary interest in the project is 
not to see a student, which it was before they were

12:28.231 --> 12:31.815
domestic. They still help students a lot, but not 
on

12:34.158 --> 12:40.744
an individual basis. Do you remember when you 
accepted your first student to work with you? Oh,

12:45.748 --> 12:47.649
yeah. I guess it was before

12:47.790 --> 12:55.196
I went to Harvard. I think it was in 1957, or perhaps 
that's when it was. I think it was somebody before

13:01.421 --> 13:03.523
that, but I think it was Robinson. And William

13:04.651 --> 13:24.780
Malkus

13:04.651 --> 13:24.780
and I sort of joined in, except in the summer he came 
down as a summer student. At the time we thought he

13:24.800 --> 13:25.782
was very dumb and slow. We just didn't understand 
why he took so long to anything to sink in. But he was

13:27.304 --> 13:28.646
just being very thorough. And we talked around for 
a long time. It seemed to be very hard to get him

13:30.689 --> 13:33.072
started. And

13:35.026 --> 13:58.559
he took both, the two brothers,

13:35.026 --> 13:58.559
and did a nice thing. He wrote a good thesis. And 
basically, he was pretty well trained in

13:59.060 --> 14:03.346
mathematics, so that he had some nice ideas about 
similarity solutions and so forth that we never

13:59.060 --> 14:03.346
heard about, to apply to trying to develop a theory 
of the thermocline. I think that paper was

14:03.366 --> 14:04.948
published in 1959, but he started working on it in 
1957. I'm really quite surprised that we kept

14:07.122 --> 14:16.978
upgrading our assessment of

14:07.122 --> 14:16.978
him all the time. He came down to us all because he 
took a kind of descriptive lecture course with

14:16.998 --> 14:23.989
Islam. And Islam brought him down, and when he got 
down here, Islam didn't know what to do with him.

14:30.921 --> 14:32.944
And so he just sort of shoved them all up in our 
direction. We weren't used to the idea of having

14:33.363 --> 14:43.983
Stewie, so here we had this guy who was supposed to 
try to do something. And as we talked, we didn't

14:44.003 --> 14:50.075
seem to know anything, and we didn't think he was 
going to do anything. He was going to be a pest, but

14:50.095 --> 14:51.939
he turned out quite differently. In a few weeks, he 
began the show. He was asking intelligent

14:52.981 --> 14:53.722
questions. We weren't experienced enough to know 
that Stewie was off to turn out and start off that

14:53.742 --> 14:56.367
way.

15:02.050 --> 15:14.666
But you

15:02.050 --> 15:14.666
didn't have many students come into Woods Hole? 
Well, I guess not the people who were there

15:15.607 --> 15:19.572
full-time. If you were in the middle 50s, if you 
were a professor of physics at Do you

15:31.210 --> 15:54.737
think that I don't want to use the word 
intellectual climate, because that's not what I

15:55.375 --> 15:57.937
mean. When you talk about Harvard, you were 
talking about what you wanted the intellectual

15:57.977 --> 16:01.161
climate to be. But do you think the

16:01.181 --> 16:11.671
service to an institution, the interchange 
between students and faculty improve an

16:01.181 --> 16:11.671
institution? Or do you prefer to be at an 
institution which is simply a research

16:11.691 --> 16:19.298
institution?

16:19.318 --> 16:22.301
I think the answer is yes to both of them. I think the 
I think

16:25.109 --> 16:48.688
there's

16:25.109 --> 16:48.688
no question that professionally oriented 
students have the energy and imagination to

16:25.109 --> 16:48.688
pursue ideas beyond what established people are 
willing to do. Partly it's energy, partly it's

16:48.708 --> 16:51.893
because they know the techniques, and partly it's 
just because But the, so there ought to be, it's

16:52.885 --> 17:05.017
very important for the students to be in a place 
like this. On the other hand, the notion of graphic

17:05.037 --> 17:14.527
institution, I haven't been talking in its whole 
life now, it's been a few, not a minute. The notion

17:14.547 --> 17:21.694
of graphic institution has a, seems to me, has a 
primary responsibility to do research field work

17:22.568 --> 17:28.516
at sea. And

17:28.796 --> 17:38.610
that universities have students, universities 
have computing machines. Some universities have

17:38.630 --> 17:45.639
instrument shops and things like that, 
engineering type ones have. But the peculiar

17:45.659 --> 17:50.145
thing about an oceanographic institution is the 
fact that it has ships or vehicles which can

17:50.632 --> 18:05.186
transport people out to the ocean and make 
measurements, and also technical support groups

17:50.632 --> 18:05.186
that are able to, like, one thing, are capable of 
putting more in the balance. So the ability to get

18:05.206 --> 18:18.900
measurements at sea seems to me to be the first 
priority of an oceanographic research

18:05.206 --> 18:18.900
institution, whereas a university seems to have 
its first priority in education, not scholarly

18:19.133 --> 18:27.743
research. Sometimes at MIT, people start saying, 
wouldn't it be a nice place if we didn't have any

18:27.763 --> 18:34.610
students? And they're thinking about how they'd 
rather do research than do teaching or

18:34.630 --> 18:40.737
supervision of PhDs. But that doesn't make much 
sense in the university. One can see that that's

18:44.802 --> 18:47.925
not the top priority. You try to have a very strong 
research program because you feel that that's a

18:48.158 --> 18:57.156
necessary vehicle to educate people at a graduate 
level. It's like a medical school has to be

18:57.176 --> 19:03.528
associated with a hospital. But the priority of 
the medical school would be to teach doctors even

19:04.249 --> 19:08.698
if they weren't allowed in the hospitals. And the 
priority of a research institution like this, a

19:09.910 --> 19:22.063
lot of it, to make measurements at sea, even though 
students were banned to come here because we all

19:09.910 --> 19:22.063
had some communicable disease. And so,

19:22.343 --> 19:28.950
unfortunately, we know we don't have to. It isn't 
black and white matter. We don't have to make those

19:31.173 --> 19:34.416
black and white choices.

19:38.311 --> 19:48.005
I was thinking more, though, in the sort of change 
in the nature of Woods Hole from, although it's

19:38.311 --> 19:48.005
still and always will remain primarily a research 
institution. Well, I don't know that, yes it is, I

19:48.726 --> 19:50.829
think. I don't

19:50.929 --> 20:04.268
think that the impact of students on Woods Hole has 
been, I don't know how to assess it. There are

20:05.294 --> 20:07.457
students everywhere. I have a feeling that if 
there weren't an educational program in Woods

20:07.517 --> 20:15.429
Hole with a dean and so on, there would still be 
students here in the summertime. And around. And

20:16.631 --> 20:23.100
the main difference would be that Woods Hole 
wouldn't have its name on the degree. But I think

20:23.120 --> 20:34.177
students would... Woods Hole would certainly get 
the credit because it would be obvious that the

20:23.120 --> 20:34.177
students had done their work

20:23.120 --> 20:34.177
and so it wouldn't matter whose name was on the 
diploma. I think... I think at Woods Hole, for

20:35.703 --> 20:51.997
example, as far as I know, even now, there's no way 
that you can tell when you talk to someone at the

20:35.703 --> 20:51.997
institution or look at the institution annual 
report who's actually teaching and who's not.

20:52.619 --> 20:54.302
There's no clear distinction between The

20:54.991 --> 21:14.818
large

20:54.991 --> 21:14.818
majority of people in the institution who don't 
teach in the ones who do at the university, it's

20:54.991 --> 21:14.818
very clear. Here it's not, and I think probably 
it's a good idea. The number of people who actually

21:16.920 --> 21:19.904
give courses here is quite small compared to the 
total number of people at the institution. I think

21:19.924 --> 21:21.066
in only one term. Physical

21:22.143 --> 21:45.264
oceanography, there are three or four courses on 
it. Maybe that's the most. Maybe two or three in the

21:45.745 --> 21:46.926
physical oceanography department. There must be 
several hundred people in the department. So I

21:48.067 --> 21:49.048
don't know, maybe 9 or 15 graduate students. They 
don't saturate them. And the absence of students

21:51.708 --> 21:58.334
had nothing to do with your transfer to Harvard and 
MIT? Well, it might have at one time. I think

22:00.937 --> 22:03.599
perhaps I was attracted to MIT. Once minds do 
change, people

22:03.619 --> 22:11.087
do change over time. When you began to rather 
narrow, if I may use that word, your career into

22:11.867 --> 22:18.394
your specialty, was it deliberate? Or did you just 
seem to more and more of your energy I

22:22.505 --> 22:49.457
think it's, I think that it's basically, as all the 
different, as all the different parts of the

22:22.505 --> 22:49.457
subject become professionalized, each one 
becomes more intricate and there is a growing body

22:22.505 --> 22:49.457
of knowledge and you, You can't really, at least I 
can't, keep track of all the different

22:49.927 --> 22:57.797
developments. So what you have to do is to say, 
either you're going to... Well,

22:57.817 --> 23:11.074
maybe the right thing to say is that maybe one It 
only seems so. It's narrowing down a little bit.

23:14.206 --> 23:30.846
Maybe it's just that the field is expanding and 
that you, it all depends, your reference point, if

23:14.206 --> 23:30.846
you,

23:14.206 --> 23:30.846
if you, if you, it's a question of some kind of 
relativity, I suppose. Either you're getting

23:30.866 --> 23:35.771
smaller or the field is getting bigger, but maybe 
both are happening. Or maybe, you know, you just

23:35.791 --> 23:38.935
don't have, maybe on some scale, I would say 
chances are that people don't change much in size,

23:39.792 --> 23:54.609
but the field grows.

23:54.629 --> 23:56.632
Probably bigger, probably the most reasonable 
judgment. So I think it's probably just a question

23:56.652 --> 24:03.980
of the field becoming more and more 
professionalized.

24:05.923 --> 24:09.647
If a person like myself, I think, tries to tries to 
look for

24:10.640 --> 24:17.709
new things all the time. Suppose you were a kind of a 
hacker carpenter. You might only do the roughing

24:23.437 --> 24:28.083
in work on houses, might you? And when it came to 
finishing them up and making them look nice and so

24:28.103 --> 24:38.537
forth like that, the real good cabinet makers and 
so forth would have to come along to the job. Well,

24:40.289 --> 24:53.719
that means that the roughing in contractors don't

24:40.289 --> 24:53.719
stand any more job for very long. They have to look 
around for new houses that are being built. So I

24:58.261 --> 25:05.749
sort of feel a little bit like a roughing 
carpenter. I feel maybe I've done some roughing on

25:05.889 --> 25:24.488
a field, and when that field begins to grow and 
become one where certain kinds of skill and care

25:05.889 --> 25:24.488
and

25:05.889 --> 25:24.488
so forth are required, I'm not really equipped to 
be able to handle it. Well then,

25:25.177 --> 25:47.534
you know,

25:25.177 --> 25:47.534
I sort

25:25.177 --> 25:47.534
of

25:25.177 --> 25:47.534
have to give up on that house and try something 
else. Maybe that's the model of it. I don't know

25:48.155 --> 25:48.616
what kind. I think that's probably very, very, 
it's a little odd. So, that's what happens. It does

25:50.559 --> 25:50.880
put the, It does put quite a little bit of burden, it 
seems to me, on the government. It's got to kind of

25:55.880 --> 26:01.090
look around all the time and find people who want to 
build houses. The other guys haven't got such a bad

26:01.110 --> 26:09.205
time because the houses are already going to start 
and people want to finish them. But it's just the

26:09.225 --> 26:13.373
way my life has been, I'm afraid. Comments on your 
early colleagues here at Woods Hole? Whom do you

26:15.802 --> 26:20.209
remember about what they were doing, 
particularly favorably or unfavorably? Oh, I

26:20.850 --> 26:29.182
think I've learned a great deal from many

26:20.850 --> 26:29.182
people here. Ewing gave me the opportunity to go to 
taste what small boat work like was at sea

26:29.202 --> 26:39.177
in the wintertime. Spine gave me an opportunity to 
learn something about tools and working

26:39.798 --> 27:02.903
machine shops, which I think has always been a 
source of pleasure for me. Wyman, Jeffrey Wyman,

27:02.923 --> 27:05.265
gave me an idea about how to, more than anyone else I 
guess, how to do how to

27:07.068 --> 27:29.014
build a

27:07.068 --> 27:29.014
construct of thought processes, some kind of a, 
how to put together some ideas. Woodcock, Al

27:29.034 --> 27:34.020
Woodcock gave me a taste, not very natural, it 
doesn't come too naturally to me, but it gave me a

27:29.034 --> 27:34.020
very good taste, I think, of the naturalist's view 
of the world. how to find something of

27:35.333 --> 27:52.896
interest, and

27:35.333 --> 27:52.896
the simplest kind of love that people

27:35.333 --> 27:52.896
don't seem to notice. And if you look around, you 
can find them. Woodcock was wonderful that way.

27:57.602 --> 27:58.523
Ray Montgomery. gave me some kind of a standard

27:58.823 --> 28:12.205
of, uh, of, uh, of, uh, scholar-ness, I guess you'd 
call it. The kind of scientist who, uh, who, uh, is

28:12.225 --> 28:20.578
careful about what he reads and what he writes and, 
uh, uh, prudes, uh, some sense of the... gave me

28:20.947 --> 28:39.365
some introductions to

28:20.947 --> 28:39.365
professionals in meteorology that I wouldn't 
have had from any of the others. I met Rossby

28:39.385 --> 28:44.030
from... Rossby, I guess, gave me the first 
indication... I met Rossby in 1946. Rossby gave me

28:46.072 --> 28:50.937
the first an indication of how very, how very, how 
you could learn something from the most vastly

28:51.473 --> 29:07.215
simplified theoretical models. You know, 
maximum simplification is what I learned, what I

29:07.235 --> 29:12.402
think I learned from Rosby.

29:16.887 --> 29:20.992
Of course, I mean, I can't go very beyond maximum 
simplification. I can't make things very

29:21.153 --> 29:24.437
complicated, so maximum simplification is a very 
useful thing. But I think I really learned that,

29:24.557 --> 29:32.628
you know, to strip things down from him. You could 
learn, certainly, in his simple things, most

29:32.648 --> 29:42.721
simple models that we construct. So I guess I may 
have left... I may have left some people out, but I

29:46.857 --> 29:59.511
think that brings me up to about, I think it brings 
me up to around 1954, 1955. It probably touches the

29:59.531 --> 30:15.008
main, main contacts that I had with the

29:59.531 --> 30:15.008
group that I think affected me in significant 
ways.

30:19.477 --> 30:28.791
I guess from that time on,

30:19.477 --> 30:28.791
I was probably about 35 or something like that. 
Probably not so strongly affected by other people

30:28.811 --> 30:46.497
so much in the same kind of way that determines what 
your career personality

30:28.811 --> 30:46.497
is going to be like. Whom did you ask to read your 
first paper? in criticizing?

30:58.484 --> 31:00.448
Fort Wyman, I think. Probably, probably, you 
know, I think the first paper I wrote was a terrible

31:00.468 --> 31:11.607
paper that I wrote for some New York Academy's 
meeting with, with Fort Wyman, and

31:16.531 --> 31:24.743
It was

31:16.531 --> 31:24.743
kind of an awful paper. He didn't seem to like it 
that much. And then my Cumulus Cloud paper, I

31:26.546 --> 31:33.456
guess, 1947, he stimulated to a large extent. And

31:33.476 --> 31:37.662
I guess

31:41.843 --> 31:46.555
I guess Wyman was my main contact.
