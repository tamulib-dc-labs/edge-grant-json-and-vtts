00:02.444 --> 00:11.158
I

00:02.444 --> 00:11.158
guess I'm looking and saying, you know, about 
policies and who makes them the big picture, who

00:02.444 --> 00:11.158
has the information. Hopefully the commander in 
chief has it. No, the question of policy is, you

00:15.065 --> 00:22.136
know, whose do you implement, which myth, mine, 
yours, how close to reality? Do we continue even

00:23.779 --> 00:28.907
though we suddenly believe it may not be true? It's 
easy to look back and say, yes, these were the key

00:29.174 --> 00:33.699
points, the dates. We can mark them. However, 
going in, it's sort of like the guy that goes out and

00:36.622 --> 00:40.667
he's told, go drain the swamp. He goes out looking 
for the plug, and suddenly he finds himself waist

00:41.788 --> 00:47.174
deep in alligators. By this time, you forget what 
your original mission was, drain the swamp. You

00:51.439 --> 00:53.482
know, our problem is it's easy getting in. We 
picked up for the French. We reestablished

00:55.624 --> 00:56.565
France. and tried to help them carry on the rebirth 
of the French colonial empire. It was dead and

01:01.656 --> 01:03.057
gone. We misread the signal. Would Vietnam have 
been better off under a communist Ho Chi Minh to

01:05.340 --> 01:10.065
start with than it was later? I'm not sure I say 
better off, but there would have been a million or

01:11.987 --> 01:16.392
two million less dead. You know, history, the long 
history has to judge the question of better or

01:17.994 --> 01:21.197
worse. Now, do we still believe our myths? We still 
believe there are very few limits on power, even

01:25.132 --> 01:30.159
post-Vietnam. You mean militarily? Militarily. 
We don't want to concede there are places we cannot

01:31.881 --> 01:35.646
go and things we cannot do. We can start it, but can 
we get the American public to contribute enough

01:36.947 --> 01:40.832
johnnies?

01:43.636 --> 01:46.480
You know, an operation that loses 30 lives is 
acceptable. An operation that loses 300,000 may

01:46.500 --> 01:49.063
not be. It's how many over how long a period of time. 
Somewhere out here in America, there's this kind

01:53.211 --> 01:56.395
of barometer. It says enough, enough is enough. 
This thing leads nowhere. Get out. And I'm not sure

02:03.664 --> 02:05.826
we know where it is and what the number is. If you 
did, you could sell it. But I think at the start of

02:09.531 --> 02:17.801
Vietnam, the great consensus was it was a good and 
noble cause.

02:17.821 --> 02:19.523
I think at the end, it was less of that. And more of, 
why did we go? Personally, I guess, you know, I look

02:22.986 --> 02:31.480
at it, you tell yourself, if you participated,

02:22.986 --> 02:31.480
you hope it was a good cause. You better believe it 
was a good cause. Because you'd really hate to

02:35.346 --> 02:39.493
think you spent your men, the equipment I could 
care less about, and the money. You'd hate to think

02:41.457 --> 02:43.440
you spent your friends the other way. That, uh, 
Intelligent people don't spend many friends, but

02:46.857 --> 02:50.460
you see a lot of infantry guys go. It's what were 
they spent for? No. What did we get back for what we

02:56.947 --> 03:00.170
expended? And that's what I guess long-term that 
you would hope that whoever says we should go

03:02.592 --> 03:11.801
should ask the serious question, what do we expect 
to do? And look at it in the cold light of day before

03:12.662 --> 03:16.105
you get in the swamp can find yourself there.

03:25.765 --> 03:30.751
Do you think that the military learned anything 
from... No. You don't think the military's

03:30.771 --> 03:33.895
learned anything from the Vietnam experience? I 
don't think the military as such learns very much

03:34.235 --> 03:40.903
from any war. Because of the bureaucracy? I think 
bureaucracy has its own inertia. The men who

03:45.169 --> 03:46.210
learned live. They got out large extent. It's a 
rapid turnover of personnel. You did your two

03:53.745 --> 03:54.826
years. You did whatever you were doing. Listen, 
whatever you will be his office. When the war

03:57.489 --> 04:00.031
ended, we cleaned the army out. We cut back to the 
very bones. The ones we kept with a bureaucratic

04:01.593 --> 04:12.424
oriented game players who look inward.

04:12.444 --> 04:16.348
I'm not sure we as a country learned very much like 
wave the flag and have a cheap victory. But make

04:17.324 --> 04:22.850
sure it's real quick and real cheap. Behind all 
those planes, all those bombs, and one of the

04:22.870 --> 04:31.158
things I think a war that never changes, you have to 
have a guy with a rifle take the hill and hold it. You

04:31.178 --> 04:34.682
must occupy the land and let's quit the game, let's 
attrit the enemy. The game is not to attrit the

04:35.123 --> 04:37.025
enemy. If there's a war, and I think war is a game, is 
let's make your side stop through the quickest

04:38.126 --> 04:47.095
means possible. And say it with a face that says if 
that's walk from one end of your country to the

04:47.817 --> 04:53.483
other, do it. If it's drop a nuke, do it. If it's drop 
more than one nuke, use them.

05:02.172 --> 05:04.194
It's like a street fight. It's not who can fight the 
longest, who can kick the hardest. It's who can

05:09.100 --> 05:12.443
kick the hardest the quickest. We did a thing in 
Vietnam called slow escalation. We staggered our

05:15.661 --> 05:17.723
troop buildups. They staggered the rate of people 
coming down the Ho Chi Minh Trail. They matched us

05:20.986 --> 05:22.547
man for man. One thing I do want to say to clear up a 
thing on Vietnam about firepower and combat. The

05:29.693 --> 05:34.938
supply in Vietnam was nine non-riflemen for each 
rifleman in the woods. The height of Vietnam,

05:36.079 --> 05:39.502
557,000 or so Americans. We had approximately 
57,000 riflemen scattered throughout the whole

05:39.902 --> 05:45.347
country. If their units all fight as riflemen when 
need be, then revert back to something else. We

05:50.734 --> 05:51.275
didn't. We took all our creature comforts, our PX, 
our BX for the air base. We took miniature American

05:57.881 --> 06:03.126
cities and made them in base camps, the enclaves. 
We created America. We took our TV station with us

06:05.869 --> 06:08.291
in Saigon. You could see Bobby the Weather Girl who 
came home and killed herself later. we had our own

06:15.820 --> 06:43.043
radio station because you didn't have to listen to 
that foreign sounding indigenous noise that was

06:15.820 --> 06:43.043
music we had our ghetto blasters the walkman radio 
which probably was as big as a truck in comparison

06:15.820 --> 06:43.043
to today we took america with us that's not how you 
win wars our commanders flew to the battlefield

06:15.820 --> 06:43.043
and flew home each day the generals died in the 
general's mess hall with all the comforts any

06:43.917 --> 06:49.207
general of mess has, and I do not begrudge them 
their privilege of rank. If you're fighting a war,

06:50.710 --> 06:53.074
gentlemen, let's fight a war. Let's not serve tea 
as the British Army did. It's not with the

06:57.162 --> 06:59.185
individual general of the province. It's the 
system. Play the game. We did. Our version of it, it

07:05.537 --> 07:07.140
didn't work.

07:12.858 --> 07:27.960
Do you think that a while ago you said that the right 
amount of firepower applied at the right time and

07:12.858 --> 07:27.960
the right...

07:12.858 --> 07:27.960
that we could have won under certain conditions? 
What do you think those conditions would have had

07:27.980 --> 07:32.406
to have been? Pre-'68, you could have nuked 
Vietnam in 61, 62, 63, 64, 65. Nobody could have

07:38.975 --> 07:40.738
done anything about it. Two ports.

07:46.521 --> 07:52.187
Haiphong Harbor was slow to be closed because at 
least 31 British merchant ships were in there

07:46.521 --> 07:52.187
unloading supplies. That's your allies helping 
the enemy. But remember, we had no constitutional

07:54.850 --> 07:59.535
enemy, no declaration of war. If you're going to 
fight one, even without a declaration, make up

08:01.137 --> 08:09.285
your mind, I've got the bomb, I've got whatever 
weapons, let's use our technology. One plane,

08:09.986 --> 08:12.008
better yet, One missile,

08:12.545 --> 08:21.997
one city gone, phone them and ask them, do you need 
demonstration number two? But remember, when you

08:22.017 --> 08:28.245
play with those at that level, if the other side 
opts in, you've got a problem. It's how far do you

08:28.265 --> 08:29.186
go. Go win and go stay home. Total commitment. 
Yeah, which we didn't have. We didn't have total

08:37.536 --> 08:38.658
commitment. We piecemealed it. It's war on the 
cheap. The way it reflects our economy, our

08:43.949 --> 08:47.835
government, our attitude. How little can we get by 
with? Piecemeal. So we piecemealed out at least

08:51.560 --> 09:01.115
eight years of American youth and decided to end 
the meal that wasn't satisfying. And then let's

09:02.877 --> 09:08.045
pretend for the next 10 years it didn't happen.

09:08.065 --> 09:12.572
And probably the greatest legacy, I guess if 
there's a legacy of Vietnam, There's always going

09:14.476 --> 09:17.440
to be a simple question hard to answer, why?

09:20.945 --> 09:23.489
And I don't have one for that. If you want to say I 
have myths, they did. But when you get into the why,

09:28.876 --> 09:33.723
I still think there's a... If it was a good cause, 
then it was worth going for. If it wasn't, we should

09:36.647 --> 09:41.474
have stayed home. And I don't think there's an easy 
way to reconcile, even for the guys that lived

09:43.822 --> 09:55.719
through it and came back, there's an easy way to 
reconcile what you say about your friends to

09:43.822 --> 09:55.719
people you met that didn't.

09:57.341 --> 09:59.044
That's the unfinished business in America. I 
think the first time I saw what they were going to

10:00.826 --> 10:09.719
build as a monument in Washington, how stupid. I 
think the longer I've looked at it in a way, how

10:09.739 --> 10:12.343
fascinating.

10:15.462 --> 10:22.889
You know, I might offer for all presidents of the 
United States, after being sworn in as

10:15.462 --> 10:22.889
commander-in-chief, their first stop is take a 
walk to the wall. Don't pause. Read all the names,

10:25.932 --> 10:27.313
Mr. President. You'll be there a long time. But 
let's make sure we understand what we're

10:30.055 --> 10:32.237
expending. You're not expending one grave 
marker. Put them all out there. Maybe the best

10:34.980 --> 10:40.505
thing for that, to ask yourself the question, you 
know, who? Well, we know who. Why? That's not on the

10:43.723 --> 10:44.924
wall. Never will be.

10:49.350 --> 10:51.934
We can play with the statues in front of it, the 
three riflemen. Fascinating enough, if you'll

10:53.336 --> 10:58.503
look at the statue, it's one black, one Anglo, one 
Hispanic. Grunts. The towel around the neck, the

11:03.430 --> 11:09.418
Vietnam clothing, the machine gun, the rifle.

11:09.438 --> 11:10.900
Now the nurses want their statues. Could be 
sarcastic and say with bedpan.

11:17.676 --> 11:22.362
Eight nurses died in Vietnam, at least, maybe 
more, at least the ones I've read about. I'm not

11:23.784 --> 11:27.910
sure how many, you know, who do we put a statue up 
next for, gays, who went, whatever. You know, I'm

11:29.192 --> 11:34.960
not sure how much you can change and have it still be 
that. But then again, who should decide what it is?

11:39.668 --> 11:41.951
I'm not sure it ought to be a commission or not be a 
commission. They got in Washington and leave

11:41.971 --> 11:43.172
that. I think the wall should serve as a reminder to 
those who commit Americans.

11:53.985 --> 11:54.806
It's not out of sight. That's one right there in 
Washington. Maybe we should build one for each

11:55.888 --> 12:00.834
war.

12:00.854 --> 12:03.016
You know, I'm not sure what you do about the others. 
A lot of them want the statue for those. And the

12:05.279 --> 12:08.663
compromise was for those who live to come home, the 
three rivalries. Do you build them next to the

12:10.212 --> 12:12.355
doctors and the nurses? I don't know. We leave it at 
that. It's much like the war in Vietnam, but not an

12:14.317 --> 12:17.121
easy answer. In fact, there's no answer.

12:27.474 --> 12:32.139
Is there anything you'd like to add?

12:32.159 --> 12:35.363
You know, I guess one remark somebody wanted to 
say, you know, sum it up. You've got two minutes.

12:40.115 --> 12:46.923
to any president or anybody who has an idea to save 
somebody. A cheap, quick answer is please do not

12:49.406 --> 12:52.730
let Vietnam stand in the way.

12:55.754 --> 12:59.899
Look at the question asked if the cause is right and 
just, don't hesitate. If there's a question of

13:02.162 --> 13:04.965
morality of what you're doing, never do it. But 
having made the decision to do it if it's just and

13:06.587 --> 13:09.531
right, Then get on with doing it.

13:14.222 --> 13:20.395
But one line thing is,

13:14.222 --> 13:20.395
go to win or go stay home.

13:24.483 --> 13:26.868
Thank you. Glad to help.

14:58.962 --> 15:06.877
Trouble seems to up and disappear.

15:06.897 --> 15:11.926
You touch me with the love you're bringing. I can't 
really lose when you're near.

15:19.060 --> 15:28.859
If all my friends have forgotten half their 
promises, they're not unkind, just hard to find.

15:28.899 --> 15:38.257
One look at you and I know that I could learn to live 
without the rest. I found the best. Getting

15:41.521 --> 15:50.704
over that rainbow When my smallest dreams won't 
come true I

15:51.646 --> 16:21.619
can take all the madness the world has to give But I 
won't last a day without you When there's no

15:51.646 --> 16:21.619
getting over that rainbow When my smallest dreams 
won't come true I can take all the madness the world

15:51.646 --> 16:21.619
has to give But I won't last a day Without you

17:00.040 --> 17:01.862
You are what you are. It was what it was. The world 
didn't end. The world never does. I wake up alive

17:11.132 --> 17:16.017
from habit, I guess. Yes, I can survive one love 
more or less. And sometimes, somewhere, somehow,

17:35.647 --> 17:43.176
I've cried my tears now I want my years now

17:50.024 --> 18:19.913
I

17:50.024 --> 18:19.913
have nowhere to go That I have to be There's no one I 
know Who's waiting for me There's so much inside I

17:50.024 --> 18:19.913
still have to give So much to be tried A lifetime to 
live And some time Some will Some heart

18:27.824 --> 18:32.470
Today won't stop me. No way to

18:32.490 --> 18:46.728
stop me.

18:49.371 --> 18:52.114
Not now. The world still owes me. I once watched you 
now. It's not with you now. Then someone

19:46.799 --> 20:10.242
There's no such thing at all

19:46.799 --> 20:10.242
There's no such thing as love It's just a word That 
kids write on the wall There's no such thing as love

19:46.799 --> 20:10.242
Oh

20:17.377 --> 20:44.329
It's just the same old rhyme The poets chime And 
poets could be wrong

20:17.377 --> 20:44.329
There's no one just for me To me they're all the same

20:17.377 --> 20:44.329
They're just an hour's fun And then I run. To me, 
it's just a game.

20:55.539 --> 21:04.668
There's no such thing as blue

20:55.539 --> 21:04.668
skies above. Because

21:04.688 --> 21:11.935
since you said goodbye, there's no such thing. 
There's no such thing.

21:31.306 --> 22:00.132
They're just an hour's fun And then I run To me it's 
just a game

21:31.306 --> 22:00.132
There's no such thing

21:31.306 --> 22:00.132
as

21:31.306 --> 22:00.132
blue Skies

21:31.306 --> 22:00.132
alone Cause since you said goodbye

22:10.625 --> 22:17.645
Because since you said goodbye, there's no such 
thing.

22:17.665 --> 22:21.917
There's no such thing as love.

22:45.623 --> 23:05.050
Strumming my pain with his fingers Singing my life

22:45.623 --> 23:05.050
with his words Killing me softly with his song 
Killing me softly with his song Telling my whole

22:45.623 --> 23:05.050
life

23:26.630 --> 23:54.544
heard he sang a good song I heard he had a style and so 
I came to see him to listen for a while

23:26.630 --> 23:54.544
and there he was this young boy a stranger to my eyes 
strumming my pain with

23:59.333 --> 24:28.952
Killing me softly with his song Killing me softly 
with his song Telling my whole life with his words

23:59.333 --> 24:28.952
Killing me softly

23:59.333 --> 24:28.952
with his song

23:59.333 --> 24:28.952
I felt all flushed with fever Embarrassed by the 
crowd I felt he found my letters And read each one

24:30.485 --> 24:59.648
out loud

24:30.485 --> 24:59.648
I prayed that he would finish But he just kept right 
on Grumming my pain with his fingers Singing my

24:30.485 --> 24:59.648
life with his words Killing me softly with his song 
Killing me softly with his song Telling my whole

25:01.585 --> 25:29.922
life with his words Killing me softly

25:01.585 --> 25:29.922
with his song

25:01.585 --> 25:29.922
He sang as if he knew me singing

25:30.813 --> 25:48.518
clear

26:01.272 --> 26:27.516
Killing me softly with his song Killing me softly 
with his song Telling my whole life with his words

26:01.272 --> 26:27.516
Killing me softly

26:01.272 --> 26:27.516
with his song

26:01.272 --> 26:27.516
Strumming my pain with his fingers Singing my life

26:30.719 --> 26:58.228
Killing me softly with his song Killing me softly 
with his song Telling my whole life with his words

26:30.719 --> 26:58.228
Killing me softly

26:30.719 --> 26:58.228
with his song

26:30.719 --> 26:58.228
Strumming my pain with his fingers Singing my life 
with his words Killing me softly with his song

27:00.048 --> 27:13.872
Killing me softly with his song Telling my whole 
life with his words Killing me softly

27:36.447 --> 27:37.990
Going, going, gone. Love is going, going, gone. 
There's a limited supply. Better bid, better buy

27:46.944 --> 27:51.552
while the sale is going on. Going, going, gone. 
Love is going, going, gone. Prices every day

28:01.642 --> 28:29.404
increase Better grab every piece You can lay your 
hands apart Going, going fast Life is going, going

28:01.642 --> 28:29.404
fast There's no time to wheel and deal Touch and 
taste, see and feel What you miss could be your last

28:01.642 --> 28:29.404
Going, going God

28:32.523 --> 28:39.054
Love

28:32.523 --> 28:39.054

is going, going twice, going twice, going twice.

28:43.541 --> 28:45.525
This is it for paradise. Going once, going twice. 
Love is going, going once.

29:16.533 --> 29:20.261
Love is going, going once, going once, going once. 
Love is going, going twice, going twice, going

29:20.622 --> 29:24.330
twice. This is it for paradise. Going once, going 
twice. Love is going, going twice.

29:50.182 --> 30:07.853
Thank

29:50.182 --> 30:07.853
you.

30:21.873 --> 30:28.541
I've had nothing new to show to you.

30:32.185 --> 30:34.067
Goodbye, dry eyes. I watched your plane fade off 
west of the moon. Then it felt so strange to walk

30:41.295 --> 30:45.720
away.

30:55.387 --> 31:21.597
Don't

30:55.387 --> 31:21.597
want

30:55.387 --> 31:21.597
you back We'd only cry again Say goodbye

31:31.128 --> 31:57.085
The

31:31.128 --> 31:57.085
hours that were yours echo like empty rooms

31:31.128 --> 31:57.085
But the thoughts we used to share Now I keep alone

31:31.128 --> 31:57.085
I woke last night and...
