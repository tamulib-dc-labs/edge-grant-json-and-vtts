WEBVTT

00:02.073 --> 00:27.372
we're not going to bury the makeup of the student 
body now as far as you know in terms of the students

00:02.073 --> 00:27.372
background and their major there is no

00:02.073 --> 00:27.372
difference between urban kids and country kids 
and their participation and ag majors and

00:02.073 --> 00:27.372
engineers and so forth is there no We're working on 
trying to put together the databases where we can

00:29.360 --> 00:42.276
combine all the different things that we do into 
one database and see how people participate to get

00:29.360 --> 00:42.276
a better feel for that. My guess is we're reaching 
in all our different programs about 90% of the

00:43.017 --> 00:48.964
student body at least one time a year. If

00:51.226 --> 00:56.633
you look at our most active people, Some of them 
come from inner city Houston, some of them come

00:57.845 --> 01:02.110
from far. There's nothing out there that some of 
the most active people that we have today didn't

01:03.031 --> 01:11.700
participate in sports at all in high school. Some 
of them played all the

01:12.220 --> 01:17.666
time. Our mission right now is really, and the 
mission statement's sitting there on my desk, but

01:17.686 --> 01:23.953
this is how I paraphrase it. Our job is to give our 
students, primarily the 18 to 22 year olds, the

01:24.153 --> 01:38.574
opportunity to experience a lot of different 
kinds of things. We want them to build an active,

01:39.376 --> 01:43.562
healthy lifestyle. That's our mission, and the 
way we do that is by providing the opportunities.

01:50.157 --> 02:18.173
and for us to be successful we have to provide a lot 
of different opportunities that's why our

01:50.157 --> 02:18.173
program is comprehensive

01:50.157 --> 02:18.173
uh what about uh minority students or we if you look 
at the makeup of the people who participate in our

01:50.157 --> 02:18.173
programs uh we're we have more it's pretty close to 
the same makeup as the university But in reality,

02:19.334 --> 02:32.726
we have more African Americans, more Hispanics, 
more American Indians, more women than the

02:19.334 --> 02:32.726
student body. Per capita. Yeah, per capita. The 
only place for short is in white males, which is

02:35.808 --> 02:38.891
kind of interesting. Have there been any teams in 
any of the competition which are minority or

02:39.512 --> 02:49.020
international that you know of? yes especially 
you know especially in soccer we have a lot of

02:49.962 --> 03:13.978
international soccer and they win they usually 
win they get a little frustrated with the way we

02:49.962 --> 03:13.978
officiate because we officiate the way americans 
officiate soccer and they want us to officiate the

02:49.962 --> 03:13.978
way internationals soccer is officiated but they 
can still win they're good enough to still win it's

02:49.962 --> 03:13.978
uh I suppose the other area that this facility has 
helped accommodate, and this is, I think, a pretty

03:16.253 --> 03:26.929
good anecdote, is the international student. 
Because, for instance, we had two hours a week

03:26.949 --> 03:33.458
where you could play badminton free play before we 
moved in here. Now you could anytime the

03:33.479 --> 03:36.823
building's open. But the sports that are favored 
by the international students are all

03:43.928 --> 04:10.662
accommodated in this building badminton 
volleyball soccer table tennis it's here and it's

03:43.928 --> 04:10.662
here all the time

03:43.928 --> 04:10.662
the of the first 25 bricks we sold and they're 
welcome champions three of those were

03:43.928 --> 04:10.662
international students that's surprising this 
especially on friday nights this is a home away

03:43.928 --> 04:10.662
from home you know they they don't can't go home 
every weekend like some of our students can but

04:10.962 --> 04:13.395
this is their home away from home. They've enjoyed 
it, they've really taken an active part in this

04:13.415 --> 04:17.918
building. Now, I would assume that table tennis or 
ping pong, which is it called today? Table tennis.

04:25.311 --> 04:26.032
Table tennis. I would assume that table tennis 
might be very keen interest to some international

04:26.052 --> 04:32.420
students. What are some, are there some other 
sports that you mentioned? Let's see, what else

04:38.927 --> 04:43.012
that are particularly attractive to 
international? Soccer. Soccer. And there's a

04:44.914 --> 04:46.656
wide variety. a number of countries that are 
really competitive in soccer. Volleyball is big

04:51.012 --> 04:53.599
with the international students. Badminton, 
especially the English and the Indians really

04:53.619 --> 05:01.759
like badminton. You'll see a lot of people playing 
badminton anytime the building's open. It's

05:06.222 --> 05:09.026
amazing how many badminton players there are. 
Squash is European and Asian.

05:15.275 --> 05:20.182
And my brain's not recovering the name of the 
English baseball. Cricket. Cricket. Do we play

05:22.406 --> 05:23.808
cricket now? We had a cricket sports club one time. 
There's some people here that play cricket, but we

05:27.233 --> 05:31.459
don't have a facility for it right now. And we don't 
play Australian football. No. That looks too

05:37.185 --> 05:38.788
dangerous to me. What about, do we play rugby? Yes. 
Rugby is a sports club. We have 29 teams that

05:43.756 --> 05:48.605
participate as if they were varsity teams. The 
only difference is their funding level for those

05:49.086 --> 05:56.198
29 teams is about $80,000 a year. so they're 
funding a lot they they they're supported

05:57.055 --> 06:20.515
primarily by funds out of their own pocket to 
participate but rugby is one of those and lacrosse

05:57.055 --> 06:20.515
there's several of the sports that are fairly 
competitive contact organizations are there

05:57.055 --> 06:20.515
some sports that have been requested that you all 
have not accommodated uh boxing We've worked a

06:21.355 --> 06:28.484
little bit with boxing, but in reality, that's a 
really tough one to manage. It's really too easy to

06:29.726 --> 06:33.431
get hurt there. Any others?

06:39.518 --> 06:40.059
Pushball. We had an incident in pushball probably 
the second or third year I was here. And the way push

06:47.832 --> 06:52.738
ball is, this giant ball is about eight foot in 
diameter and it's filled with air.

06:56.342 --> 07:05.032
On the surface it doesn't seem like it's a 
dangerous game, but just teams line up and you

06:56.342 --> 07:05.032
decide to try to push it across the other person's 
field. The way the Corps used to play it is they

07:05.412 --> 07:12.000
would start on the goal line with the ball on the 50 
yard line and they'd run to the ball. Of course,

07:13.229 --> 07:19.879
what happens is you get this huge pressure exerted 
on one side and you almost get a kickback effect. We

07:21.061 --> 07:27.110
had a gentleman hurt pretty severely in one of 
those games. There's other ways to enjoy sport

07:27.170 --> 07:31.116
besides something that can be sedentary. So we 
kind of eliminated push ball. I can't think of any

07:33.340 --> 07:34.782
others. As the years went on, what about the Corps 
involvement and interest in intramurals? Did it

07:42.748 --> 07:44.793
remain strong or did it decline? The

07:44.853 --> 07:50.607
interest has always been very strong. What we've 
tried to do with the Corps achieve a balance

07:53.678 --> 07:58.764
because they are looking at a more balanced 
approach. They want people to participate in

07:58.784 --> 08:00.907
sports. They want them to be competitive. They 
want them to understand competition in sports.

08:05.973 --> 08:07.955
But they also want them to compete in the 
classroom. They want them to get grades that are

08:08.015 --> 08:12.501
good enough to get a graduation, get out of here. So 
they try to balance that. At one time, I think we had

08:17.687 --> 08:22.032
gone, there's a course on a point system. and 
they're competing for, part of the general Moore

08:22.737 --> 08:29.137
trophy is points awarded through intervals. So 
we, in trying to offer a diverse program, we put too

08:34.769 --> 08:38.093
many points on the points system, then we had to 
back off a little bit. And it's primarily now the

08:38.213 --> 08:42.317
four major sports plus the two meets that the Corps 
is competing in. And they can compete in other

08:42.978 --> 08:45.360
things, it's just not for points. But the problem 
with the Corps, if we put it on the points system,

08:45.741 --> 08:49.825
they have a team. And Senator Gere was 
overextending that. And are the Corps sports

08:53.108 --> 08:55.311
co-ed also? We have... I wish I knew the answer to 
that. I know we started down that road. Whether

09:03.539 --> 09:05.461
we're still doing it or not, I'm not sure. My 
problem right now at Haskell is that we went from

09:06.962 --> 09:17.952
eight years ago having 12, 13 people on staff, and 
now we've got 50 people on staff. Sure, sure. I'm

09:19.434 --> 09:22.216
having trouble keeping up with all that stuff. 
Type us this next note. You can leave out. I just

09:25.239 --> 09:29.143
want to share an anecdote with him. As of last fall, 
I think this fall would also be the same, 5% of all

09:29.123 --> 09:39.559
undergraduate males at UT were in fraternities, 
6% females were in sororities. The percentages

09:40.240 --> 09:43.906
here instead of 5 and 6 are 6 and 14. We have a higher 
percentage of undergraduates in fraternity

09:45.148 --> 09:50.136
sororities than UT. We have more corps members 
than we, I mean more fraternity and sorority

09:50.116 --> 09:55.204
members than we have members of the corps. And I 
learned not long ago that three of last year's Yale

09:55.906 --> 10:01.976
leaders who were corps members were also 
fraternity members. And I hadn't thought about

10:02.617 --> 10:03.939
that. So how things are shifting. You probably 
recall before you left that there was a big deal

10:14.230 --> 10:18.276
about fraternities, and especially amongst the 
core. Oh, yeah. No, no. Then of all of the 54

10:22.702 --> 10:34.500
four-year institutions in Texas, public and 
private, only eight of those have an

10:22.702 --> 10:34.500
undergraduate male majority. We're one of the 
eight. So one of the shifts, and nobody can really

10:37.264 --> 10:42.752
explain why, A higher percentage of young women 
are going to college now than young men. We're

10:47.928 --> 10:55.611
still, and we've had more entering freshmen the 
last two falls who were women than men. but then we

10:56.536 --> 11:22.881
got transfer uh menil coming in i think so what uh 
but did i ask about some uh requests for sports that

10:56.536 --> 11:22.881
y'all didn't want to offer some activities i can't 
think of any others that you've just flatly turned

10:56.536 --> 11:22.881
down one of the things that that we we have to do and 
we've probably done a pretty good job over the

11:22.861 --> 11:51.298
years is when we look at a sport you can take 
football and make it flag football non-contact

11:22.861 --> 11:51.298
and a fairly good game fairly safe game so you're 
taking risk and managing it and putting it in a

11:22.861 --> 11:51.298
context that everybody can play this game you try 
to do that with we have tried to do that with sports

11:52.477 --> 11:54.341
that people have an interest in. And there's some 
things that we haven't quite figured out how to do

11:54.802 --> 11:57.988
that. So we hate to say no. Sometimes we feel like we 
have to. But we would rather say, well, let us work

12:04.101 --> 12:06.787
on it. Let's see if we can figure out a way to make 
this game rugby.

12:20.152 --> 12:34.946
Which

12:20.152 --> 12:34.946
sports have had more problems that cause you more 
difficulty and which are the most free of

12:20.152 --> 12:34.946
problems? Softball is probably the most free of 
problems. It's more of a social game. People don't

12:41.072 --> 12:44.095
get as excited about it in general. Basketball is 
always the most contentious. that people are so

12:47.219 --> 13:03.263
close together, there's a lot of physical contact 
in basketball that the game basically says

12:47.219 --> 13:03.263
there's

12:47.219 --> 13:03.263
no physical contact. And it's hard to officiate, 
hard to officiate . So that's probably the

13:04.244 --> 13:05.826
toughest one. What kinds of injuries have, in 
those 27 years, have you had to help with? A lot of

13:13.097 --> 13:13.598
them. A lot of injuries. Basketball probably, 
again, provides the most injuries, and most of

13:17.003 --> 13:23.471
them are minor, so to speak. We have had very few 
major injuries. I can't even tell you. When you

13:31.620 --> 13:41.873
start having neck injuries and head injuries, we 
had a female hit in the face with a softball off the

13:31.620 --> 13:41.873
bat, and that's pretty close. That's some 
reconstructive surgery. We had a few things like

13:44.425 --> 13:54.160
that, but the majority of our injuries are turned 
ankle, turned knees, then you have the blown out

13:44.425 --> 13:54.160
knees, and you have the broken ankles. So there's 
quite a variety, but there's a lot of injuries.

13:59.028 --> 14:03.936
We're involved in a high risk, and our job is to try 
to manage that risk. to a point where we aren't

14:04.422 --> 14:12.371
taking college students who come here to get an 
education and put them in a situation where they

14:04.422 --> 14:12.371
can't go to school because of an injury. So we've 
got to try to manage that stuff. All right. Go

14:17.056 --> 14:29.509
through the presidents you've worked with and 
indicate their apparent interest in intramurals

14:17.056 --> 14:29.509
or lack thereof, beginning with Williams. Jack 
Williams was here when it came in.

14:34.983 --> 14:40.531
Because I was pretty young, I'm not sure if I knew we 
had a relationship at that time. But most people

14:41.312 --> 14:46.139
felt pretty good about him. He was very 
supportive. I sure did. From what I could tell,

14:50.686 --> 14:59.879
especially from John Colas, he was very pleased 
with

14:50.686 --> 14:59.879
me. Jarvis Miller. Jarvis Miller was wonderful. 
He was so personable. Now whether he actually got

15:07.287 --> 15:11.816
things accomplished for us or not, I'm not sure, 
but he was very personal. He always made you feel

15:11.836 --> 15:15.563
good about what you were doing. So that was kind of a 
nice pat on the back all the time he got from Jarvis

15:15.583 --> 15:19.130
Miller. Chuck Sampson then for a year. Chuck 
Sampson was great. He was the guy, he was just the

15:25.608 --> 15:27.711
opposite of Jarvis. He didn't have a lot of 
personality on the surface, but I tell you what, he

15:27.731 --> 15:35.541
was there helping you. He was a hard worker and he 
understood what we did and I'm not sure where that

15:36.742 --> 15:43.651
came from, but he understood. When I went, there 
were a few times I had a chance to talk to him and he

15:43.771 --> 15:49.298
understood things we were talking about. We 
didn't have to explain it to him. He's a bright guy.

15:53.303 --> 15:54.425
Very supportive. Then Frank Vanderburg. He was 
not. Frank Vandiver, we'd have been better off if

15:57.345 --> 16:00.668
he'd stayed at Rice. And I think our band told him 
that one day down at Rice Stadium. And he and John

16:07.815 --> 16:12.359
Coles didn't have a good relationship from what 
I've heard. All I know is that it was not the best of

16:12.499 --> 16:20.606
times for John, probably not the best of times for 
us. But in reality, I was far enough removed that It

16:24.046 --> 16:25.808
probably didn't hurt me much. See, I was his first 
doctoral student. Nice guy, but he had no

16:29.991 --> 16:39.080
experience at a public institution, except he did 
his master's degree at Texas. He got his

16:39.140 --> 16:41.602
undergraduate degree by examination. He never 
went to class, an organized class, in his life

16:42.863 --> 16:49.028
until he began his master's degree at age 16. Wow. 
He finished his Ph.D. in two nine-month years at

16:50.009 --> 16:54.053
Tulane Washington University, St. Louis, then 
Rice, then here. Well, Tulane, Wash U, and Rice are

16:58.982 --> 17:02.248
very different from here. And he didn't 
understand this place. He didn't. He didn't

17:06.796 --> 17:09.801
understand the need for Student Services 
Division. See, he never. All right, and then I

17:12.226 --> 17:13.628
believe Mobley. He was good. And he was another guy 
that really made you feel good about what you were

17:16.483 --> 17:22.371
doing for the university. And I still have a couple 
of notes from him, different functions that we

17:24.514 --> 17:33.787
were together on. And he was the kind of guy that 
stopped me right at the note. And Dean Gage then was

17:37.893 --> 17:39.615
the interim. Yeah, Dean Gage was really good, I 
thought. I mean, very friendly guy, seemed to be

17:41.657 --> 17:48.145
very supportive. He was great.

17:53.091 --> 17:58.877
All right, then after Dean Gage, I believe Dr. 
Bowen. Dr. Bowen was fantastic. Great. He and Dr.

18:02.542 --> 18:07.307
Sutton have a good relationship. old findings 
that your whole funny stability is so much better

18:07.878 --> 18:14.551
than it was before. I think he's I think he's great 
manager.

18:23.509 --> 18:24.491
Super intelligent. Doesn't take him long to 
understand an issue.

18:36.363 --> 18:39.269
Doesn't have as much personality as some people 
would like him to have. But when it gets down to the

18:41.132 --> 18:46.382
real issue, can be very supportive. And has never 
put me in a situation where I felt bad or felt like he

18:47.043 --> 18:54.858
didn't support me. Sometimes he just forgets to 
tell you that he does, maybe. I think student

19:00.443 --> 19:08.372
affairs as a whole is 100% better off now than they 
were 10 years ago. A lot of that has to do with Ray

19:08.392 --> 19:11.255
Bowen. I think overall we're probably doing 
better work, too. Now, you were officially

19:15.359 --> 19:23.568
reporting to the Department of what used to be 
Health and Physical Education. When did that

19:24.690 --> 19:26.772
cease? It changed in 1980 when Carl Landis 
retired, and I reported to Leonard Ponder, who was

19:27.764 --> 19:41.591
the department head, and he reported to John 
Koldus for intramurals for recreational sports

19:27.764 --> 19:41.591
at that time. And then he reported to the dean for 
the rest of the things that went on in the

19:42.332 --> 19:47.081
department. And then when Leonard retired, I'm 
trying to recall the year. That was when, and I

19:53.051 --> 20:09.754
don't remember for sure, that was when we went 
officially over to Student Affairs and did not

19:53.051 --> 20:09.754
report to the... Actually, that may have been, we 
may have been in that relationship until we moved

19:53.051 --> 20:09.754
into this building. All right. Ninety-five. All 
right, and then now? Now I report to... to Jan

20:19.486 --> 20:24.373
Winifred, who was Associate Vice President for 
Student Affairs. But still within Student

20:24.493 --> 20:26.316
Affairs. Yeah. All right. Go through the years and 
show the change in the number of staff. Oh, I wish my

20:34.969 --> 20:36.912
memory was that good. We had, in 1973, another 
little

20:36.932 --> 20:44.683
story. As I, the way I recall this, I got a letter 
later that said I was hired, but as I recall it, I

20:46.132 --> 20:57.306
walked out of Carl Landis' office and he had 
offered me the job. And at that point in time, the

20:59.169 --> 21:08.902
department was, the Intermural Department was 
the director, full-time secretary, and

20:59.169 --> 21:08.902
full-time maintenance person. And we had some 
student workers. Well, when we walked out of Carl

21:11.630 --> 21:20.218
Landis' office and the office just outside of his 
office, there's a gentleman named Jim Dieter. And

21:20.238 --> 21:22.200
he said, by the way, let me introduce you to Jim 
Dieter. He's your new assistant director. Brand

21:25.063 --> 21:25.944
new position. Carl had already offered the job 
before you offered the job to me, which is okay. And

21:31.829 --> 21:33.231
Jim and I became great friends. He's a great, great 
worker. Now, what was his primary task at that

21:34.772 --> 21:37.174
time? At that time, You know, really the first year 
we did everything together, because he was brand

21:38.360 --> 21:41.945
new. He just finished his master's degree, but had 
not worked in recreational sports specifically.

21:47.412 --> 21:48.694
He'd been in physical education. So the first year 
we did everything together, training officials,

21:49.234 --> 21:53.740
everything. From that point on, I became a pretty 
good delegator. He basically ran the program.

22:03.723 --> 22:27.452
majority of the programming efforts that next 
year and then after that we hired another person

22:03.723 --> 22:27.452
see we went from so we started with four people our 
budget was $50,000 hired Jim was the first one then

22:03.723 --> 22:27.452
we hired Susan slider the next year in 1974 and we 
hired John Meyer in 1975 I think it was

22:32.562 --> 22:42.135
Then we hired some graduate assistantships and we 
had a little trouble with graduate

22:32.562 --> 22:42.135
assistantships because most of them were looking 
for a recreation degree and we really didn't have

22:32.562 --> 22:42.135
that here. So in 1980, I think was a big change, we 
dropped our graduate assistantship positions

22:43.697 --> 22:55.954
and hired three full-time people, which was a big 
change, a big number in nearly one year. So we were

22:57.537 --> 23:06.891
up to about in the mid 80s about 12 full-time 
professionals and then some clerical staff. When

23:08.713 --> 23:21.752
we started planning for staffing this facility 
and the program related to it, we were at 21

23:08.713 --> 23:21.752
full-time people. That's everybody. 
Maintenance workers, support staff, and

23:27.203 --> 23:28.985
professional staff. We're today at 50 staff. Most 
of that growth happened with new programs and

23:35.614 --> 23:46.688
increasing what we're doing with facility 
management with the Student Recreation Center.

23:47.328 --> 23:54.898
But the other part that really causes significant 
growth is we, in 1998, took over the golf course.

23:57.190 --> 24:21.932
1996 we took over the golf course yeah july of 96 we 
took over the golf course and that added 10 people

23:57.190 --> 24:21.932
so and in the the traditional recreational 
intramural recreational sports side of the house

23:57.190 --> 24:21.932
we went from five to 40 or four to 40 people so 
tenfold and then we picked up the golf course and

24:22.165 --> 24:26.250
now we're 50 full-time staff. Our budgets went 
from $50,000 from 1973 to $9 million this year. And

24:35.180 --> 24:36.522
the source of that funding? There's two primary 
sources, student service fees, about $1.6

24:37.583 --> 24:45.793
million, and recreational sports fee, which 
raises about $4.7 million. All right, and both of

24:45.813 --> 24:49.237
those are from students. Right. We generate the 
rest of it. What are the sources of that

24:54.228 --> 24:56.412
generation?

25:03.585 --> 25:08.895
Intramural entry fees, about $85,000 a year. 
Memberships, 300, 350,000. Memberships for this

25:14.300 --> 25:16.745
facility, non-student members. Guest passes to 
use this facility is about 180,000. I mean,

25:21.174 --> 25:23.759
there's a long list. Aerobics is about 85,000. 
Locker rental. Close to $100,000. The golf course

25:31.537 --> 25:35.307
generated $840,000 this last year. Does the golf 
course break even? We made money last year.

25:39.599 --> 25:40.502
Really? The golf course has been generating some 
pretty good money, but we've been slowly doing

25:40.887 --> 25:49.014
some upgrades. So we had a plan going in red for 
about four years in a row. We actually made money

25:54.639 --> 25:56.260
this year, though. I can show you the bottom line in 
this black. We kind of like it. We'll probably stay

26:00.103 --> 26:01.785
there for a while now. In all, I think we generate 
$2.3

26:03.586 --> 26:10.692
million. Describe

26:10.790 --> 26:26.345
how this facility came to be, the planning and the 
key people and the steps to it and all that. Tell as

26:27.006 --> 26:28.667
much of that story as you can. In 1987, actually we 
put together a facility, a needs assessment

26:40.422 --> 26:47.108
survey, send it out, get the materials back. And we 
may have done that in the fall. We did the analysis

26:49.029 --> 26:50.791
in January. And I was talking with John Coles. I 
said, we have done this study. And at some point in

26:59.338 --> 27:03.902
time, we really ought to go to the students and talk 
to them about doing a referendum, too. At that

27:05.683 --> 27:08.506
point in time, the state was not building any 
facilities. This was 1987. we weren't going to get

27:10.291 --> 27:39.758
any help from from uh dr mccandless at that time 
because he didn't have any help to give us so we uh we

27:10.291 --> 27:39.758
we talked about using student fees to build a 
building he asked me to go speak to his two student

27:10.291 --> 27:39.758
leader groups that he meets with and he's with them 
every other week with two different groups when he

27:10.291 --> 27:39.758
has dinner with them every tuesday night and went 
and talked to them and we were talking about doing

27:40.717 --> 27:49.410
it a year later and they said, no, let's do it now. So 
we, and I don't remember all the names of the people

27:50.511 --> 28:02.389
that were involved in that.

28:02.409 --> 28:07.416
We had a great group of student leaders that we 
worked with. I need some names in here. See, to me,

28:11.024 --> 28:26.844
one of the pleasant things, pleasant realities, 
because just like you, I came from another school

28:11.024 --> 28:26.844
here, so I'm also a convert, is the comparatively 
positive reaction of student leaders here, like

28:11.024 --> 28:26.844
Fred Heath with the library. They endorsed 
increasing their fee to keep upgrading the

28:27.404 --> 28:32.230
library. And I'm thinking, hooray, hooray, that 
kind of trust. They really are. Yeah, here's the

28:38.952 --> 28:43.357
list.

28:43.577 --> 28:47.701
These are the students that attend the meeting. 
Mike Sims, student body president. David

28:49.463 --> 28:51.545
McDowell, president of RHA. Carl Wilkinson, 
Corps Commander. Bobby Beiser, president of the

28:54.368 --> 28:56.150
MSC. Remember him? He's still around. Helen 
Delafont, Carolyn Brown, graduate student

28:59.733 --> 29:04.919
council, prison senior class. Marty Holmes, the 
all-in-group. Frank Rhodes, University

29:06.509 --> 29:17.127
Department Counsel, Scott Mandel, President of 
Campus Studies, Warren Steffi, editor of the

29:06.509 --> 29:17.127
battalion, and he was one of our biggest 
supporters. Of course, it's unusual for a student

29:17.427 --> 29:20.392
to be editor of the paper each year. Biggest 
problem. And this is what year? 87? 87. We met with

29:24.940 --> 29:27.685
student leaders on February 12, 1987. Now, you 
invited them... Actually, they meet all the time.

29:31.765 --> 29:34.448
They met all the time with Dr. Coles and they 
invited me. I did this presentation. I said, we're

29:35.969 --> 29:38.952
thinking about doing this referendum next year. 
I'm taking it to the legislature the year after

29:39.913 --> 29:41.796
that. And they said, let's do the referendum now. 
So what that meant was. Do you remember the

29:46.841 --> 29:48.423
approximate vote? Yes, I can tell you exactly. 
62.8% in favor. My, my. So almost two to one. Yeah.

29:59.699 --> 30:07.907
The interesting thing was we decided to do a, 
instead of having the Student Senate put it on the

29:59.699 --> 30:07.907
ballot, to do a petition. And that was part of, of 
course, the advertising campaign in reality. So

30:11.530 --> 30:14.173
we did this petition, got signatures. We had it 
turned into Friday before spring break. That gave

30:18.857 --> 30:24.542
us Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday, spring break to 
plan our campaign and start putting materials

30:18.857 --> 30:24.542
together. And then we had Monday through Friday, 
and then Monday of the next week and Tuesday and

30:28.370 --> 30:40.764
Wednesday, but polling was over Tuesday and 
Wednesday, so we had those eight days to actually

30:28.370 --> 30:40.764
do the campaign. What were the contentions of the 
opponents? We really didn't have anybody come out

30:44.788 --> 30:50.975
and form a no vote. In reality, I think some people 
just were concerned that going from zero to 50

30:50.995 --> 30:57.482
bucks, I'd say it's a pretty big increase. It's 
interesting because we just had a referendum this

30:58.745 --> 31:10.403
last spring and what we told the students 
basically that we would like to be able to keep what

30:58.745 --> 31:10.403
we have and in order to afford that we need to do 
this. So we didn't offer them anything new and we

31:11.745 --> 31:16.251
actually raised the price by $7. And

31:16.412 --> 31:24.424
we had a 68% positive vote on that one. Now the fee 
originally was to...
