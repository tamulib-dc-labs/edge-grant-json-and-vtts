WEBVTT

00:02.022 --> 00:08.028
Saturday weekend, and he wants to drive 
everywhere in the world, you know. I remember what

00:08.048 --> 00:09.910
that was like. Okay, so let's, how'd you get in? May 
1943, I was inducted into the Army. I had completed

00:21.541 --> 00:31.911
four years of ROTC at A&M, and I was waiting, I was in 
February 1943, I had completed four years of ROTC.

00:32.701 --> 00:39.791
And if I'm not mistaken, I had a straight A in bull 
techs. And I was also captain of the basketball

00:39.811 --> 00:41.974
team. And I also applied to the University of Texas 
Medical School. And I had gotten a letter saying

00:47.602 --> 00:57.356
they were evaluating my application. They would 
let me know. So I talked to A&M. A&M says, well, you

01:03.160 --> 01:07.566
can stay till you hear from the medical schools. 
And my class was called up in February of 43 to go to

01:07.586 --> 01:14.195
the Army. And so

01:14.215 --> 01:31.800
I didn't get medical school, so I was inducted into 
the Army in May of 43.

01:32.607 --> 01:39.217
Fort Sam, and they sent me to Fort Sill, Oklahoma 
for basic training. So they wired A&M to give me my

01:40.358 --> 01:46.627
commission, which I had earned. And Colonel 
Welty, who was a commandant at that time, wouldn't

01:47.489 --> 01:50.793
release my papers. Why not? Because I had not gone 
in February. He was mad at me.

02:02.678 --> 02:04.600
What did he think? I don't know what he thought, 
Terry. You were slacking off or something? I don't

02:08.345 --> 02:10.347
know if I was slacking or what. But he wouldn't 
release my papers. So I had to go through basic

02:14.132 --> 02:21.520
training, May, June, and July, and apply to OCS. 
Really? That's right. Instead of getting a

02:24.544 --> 02:26.346
commission immediately? Immediately. And so I 
went ahead. That cost the government a lot. It did.

02:31.585 --> 02:34.369
I went ahead and went through basic training as a 
recruit. And of course, in the artillery school, a

02:35.551 --> 02:46.047
sergeant who was in charge of recruit training 
recognized immediately that I knew something

02:35.551 --> 02:46.047
about field artillery. So he made me his 
assistant, acting corporal or something. So I got

02:51.455 --> 02:54.039
some good training and leadership there. And I got 
consideration from the sergeant.

03:00.914 --> 03:05.078
Guard duty and all that stuff that they normally 
put you on. Anyway, I had to apply to OCS, like

03:05.098 --> 03:10.203
anybody else. And I was accepted. And they sent me 
to fuel artillery OCS there at Fort Salem, and I

03:13.286 --> 03:18.331
graduated November 11. Yeah, in 43. 43.

03:23.035 --> 03:23.536
Yeah, 43. Then I was immediately sent to- 
Commissioned. I knew you were commissioned.

03:27.519 --> 03:29.301
Commissioned November 11. And I was sent to the 8th 
Armored Division in Fort Polk, Louisiana. And I

03:33.622 --> 03:39.087
stayed with the division until I went overseas. 
And when did you go overseas? September 1944.

03:52.118 --> 03:59.845
And went to England and then we went into the Battle 
of the Bulge of January 1945. What was England like

04:00.179 --> 04:02.222
when you got there? Well, it was wet, cold. We were 
on a place called Windmill Hill. We picked up our

04:09.012 --> 04:14.561
equipment and we didn't, we couldn't do much 
traveling. Went down to Bournemouth, England.

04:17.585 --> 04:27.300
Went to London one day and got off the train and 
there was a buzz bomb went off a couple blocks away

04:17.585 --> 04:27.300
and blew us all down so I got back on the train and 
went back to Westchester where we were, Woodmill

04:27.972 --> 04:30.395
Hill. How'd you get along with the British people? 
Good, very good. Got along well. And then we

04:36.382 --> 04:47.676
crossed the channel, went into France, and then we 
went into the Bulge with General Patton's army.

04:48.116 --> 04:49.698
Yeah, I wanted to talk about that. Of course this is 
December 1944. So when did you first see action?

04:56.206 --> 04:56.967
January. 12, 1945. That's when you first saw 
action, doing the bulge. No, it was earlier than

05:05.969 --> 05:06.811
that. It was January the 5th. Well, early January. 
Early January. Were you called, were you always

05:15.560 --> 05:21.568
expected, once you were in England, were you 
always expected to be shipped over? Oh, yes. There

05:22.329 --> 05:23.470
was no question about it. No question about it. Did 
they accelerate because of that? Accelerated,

05:25.673 --> 05:26.534
that's right. Because of the Battle of the Bulge. 
That's right. Okay. Then the Germans attack in

05:31.360 --> 05:34.564
December of 1944. Right. And who was your 
commanding officer? Who was your general? What

05:42.895 --> 05:43.756
army were you in? General Devine. Okay. It was the 
8th Army Division.

05:50.100 --> 05:51.743
General John M. Devine. He was a West Point 
classic.

05:59.117 --> 06:04.467
I received from him the first silver star for 
gallantry in action. the Battle of the Bows or the

06:05.307 --> 06:07.410
Fjallraven. Okay, now I want you to describe this 
action. I've got the little printout here on it,

06:10.314 --> 06:15.422
but I'd like you to describe how you won Silver 
Star. We were, we were attacking a little town

06:17.565 --> 06:21.510
called Nenning, Germany. And I was with- How do you 
spell that? N-E-N-N-I-N-G, Germany. And it's

06:28.521 --> 06:33.728
right where the Moselle River and Luxembourg, 
Germany and France meet. Right in there. And we

06:36.114 --> 06:41.880
were attacking a German strong point. It was a 
chateau. And in the town of Ninning, I was with C

06:44.103 --> 06:50.850
Company of the 7th Infantry. And the battalion 
commander was Colonel Poinier. And I was with him,

06:56.997 --> 07:03.985
and he was directing the fight.

07:05.180 --> 07:16.135
During the night on the jump off some of the 
infantrymen got hit pretty bad and there weren't

07:05.180 --> 07:16.135
any medics around. So I went back and got the medics 
and brought them up there and we evacuated. You

07:23.225 --> 07:24.186
drove back? I walked back. Walked back to the 
medics. They were pretty far back and got the

07:26.750 --> 07:31.296
ambulances and everybody to come up there. And so 
then as dawn was breaking, the commander wanted

07:35.217 --> 07:48.677
some artillery support, so I went forward beyond 
the line and directed artillery fire preparation

07:35.217 --> 07:48.677
for him to jump off. And so when he did, the 
battalion commander went with him, Colonel

07:49.738 --> 07:54.846
Pornier, and he got hit. And so he laid out, we were 
at the edge of town, and he was sort of a courtyard

07:56.188 --> 08:04.380
thing, and the battalion commander was laying out 
in the opening. And two medics went to get him, and

08:06.778 --> 08:12.183
they were killed immediately by snipers. And so we 
sat there for 30, 40 minutes. How did you know he was

08:19.369 --> 08:20.570
alive? Well, he would move a little bit. Oh, OK. But 
we knew that the medics were dead. They were just

08:27.196 --> 08:28.117
dead. You could tell because the bullet hit one of 
them in the head, and the other hit him just below

08:28.177 --> 08:34.182
the neck. And so we knew they were dead. And so I kept 
looking around, and I said, where's the rest of the

08:38.214 --> 08:43.681
medics? And they said, there's no more. So we got to 
get Colonel Parneer out of there. And they said,

08:49.429 --> 08:51.651
well, what are we going to do? I said, here's what 
we're going to do. And I ran, and I got him, and I drug

08:53.233 --> 08:55.717
him back. And while doing so, the mortar fire and 
infantry fire, it was all around us. pulled him

09:05.667 --> 09:34.830
back behind a wall and by that time we were under an 
artillery barrage and the bricks and everything

09:05.667 --> 09:34.830
began to fall and here was a colonel was laying 
there face up and so I took off my helmet which you

09:05.667 --> 09:34.830
don't never do and I put it over his face and then I 
got on top of his body and then all the bricks fell on

09:05.667 --> 09:34.830
my back and so After that slacked up, then the 
medics could come. They could come where we were.

09:40.939 --> 09:43.643
And so they came up there with the ambulance. And I 
gave him a couple of morphine shots and marked his

09:43.663 --> 09:49.291
head. Morphine. That's what we did. All F-4 
observers carried about a dozen morphine

09:52.135 --> 09:57.964
syringes with them. And you break them like these 
iodine swabs, morphine swabs. And you used them in

10:01.328 --> 10:04.513
case somebody got hurt like current partner. When 
you did, you took an iodine swab and you marked a

10:04.882 --> 10:11.311
man's head, morphine one or morphine two. Depends 
on how many shots you do. And so they evacuated him.

10:17.059 --> 10:28.094
And I left that position and I went forward again 
and I directed artillery barrage for about two

10:17.059 --> 10:28.094
hours on top of a chateau that was holding us up. And 
inside the chateau were better than 500 Germans.

10:34.733 --> 10:35.794
No kidding. Oh man, we couldn't move. And so by the 
time the artillery barrage let up, and

10:37.497 --> 10:52.737
incidentally, I directed the battalion barrage, 
division artillery, corps, and we got army, third

10:37.497 --> 10:52.737
army artillery in there. So you can imagine the 
artillery fire we were getting. So you were the

10:56.062 --> 10:57.544
spotter for all of them? I was the spotter. I was the 
spotter for the whole army artillery. And as soon

11:01.549 --> 11:03.812
as We were ready, as soon as the infantry and tanks, 
the armored tanks, were ready to move off, I ceased

11:04.265 --> 11:09.670
fire. And they moved in and captured this chateau, 
which was holding up the whole line. And from then

11:14.935 --> 11:16.597
on, they went on in. Well, Colonel Parney had lived 
and came back on a cane to direct his battalion many

11:17.658 --> 11:28.788
weeks later, and came over and thanked me. But for 
that, they gave me the Silver Star. for gallantry

11:34.049 --> 11:35.250
in action. The oddity of it, Terry, was that my 
battery commander, who had to write up a citation,

11:36.171 --> 11:45.840
put in for a Bronze Star. And when it got to the 
division staff, they saw it. They upgraded it to

11:49.744 --> 11:51.786
Silver Star. And then they made that presentation 
to me just before we crossed the Rhine River.

12:00.254 --> 12:03.938
General Devine came down, had a regular. passing 
review type parade because it was the first Silver

12:04.340 --> 12:13.011
Star given in the field artillery, division 
artillery. And also, at the same time, I was hit. I

12:17.177 --> 12:20.561
was hit in the face and I was hit in the back, but I 
didn't stop. When I went back to get the medics...

12:21.542 --> 12:23.765
What were you hit with? Martyrs. Shrapnel? 
Shrapnel. When I went back to get the medics, my

12:26.749 --> 12:29.192
face was bloody. And so the medic says, 
Lieutenant, you better sign in here and and get

12:33.905 --> 12:34.946
some medical aid. I said, I don't have time. Well, 
sign here. I said, well, you sign my name, Mike P.

12:37.809 --> 12:40.351
Kokonos. So they signed my name, Mike P. Kokonos. I 
just took the medics, and blood was all running

12:44.496 --> 12:47.999
down my face here. I got hit right here. You were 
lucky. I was very lucky. At the time, I got hit. Were

12:53.905 --> 12:55.947
you just skinned across the face? It was shrapnel. 
It went in, and I think it stayed in there. Because

13:00.280 --> 13:04.525
some years later, it opened up and dropped out. No 
kidding? Yeah. And I was hitting the back. My back

13:08.410 --> 13:09.332
had a score. Where did it drop to? Right. I don't 
know. It hung in here. So you had to have it cut out?

13:14.959 --> 13:15.960
It came out. You know, it looked like a little... It 
fested all the time. I thought it was a pimple. It

13:23.830 --> 13:24.471
came out. One day, oh, gosh, about five years 
later. So the... And how about the back injury?

13:31.977 --> 13:33.258
Yeah, it was a shrapnel. It cut me. Just cut my back. 
I had a map out, and the infantry company commander

13:37.424 --> 13:44.714
was showing me how they were going to make this 
tackle in the chateau. And we were behind a ditch.

13:47.177 --> 13:51.042
And me and my corporal, radio operator, and 
sergeant were there. And the three, the captain

13:51.663 --> 13:56.629
and his two platoon leaders, so it was six of us. The 
mortars fell right in the middle of us. I got up, my

14:01.925 --> 14:07.073
sergeant got up, my corporal got up, the other 
three didn't. They had to carry them out on

14:07.093 --> 14:10.037
litters. The company commander got killed, and 
the other two were just severely wounded,

14:10.057 --> 14:15.104
seriously wounded. So that's when I got hit, and 
that's when I went back and got with the battalion

14:15.685 --> 14:23.216
commander, and he was telling me what they were 
doing. But I was very lucky. No kidding. Oh, just.

14:29.846 --> 14:31.008
Probably lucky. Oh. I don't know how the good Lord, 
I guess, stayed with me. But after that, I crossed

14:35.292 --> 14:52.556
the Rhine River with the— So tell me, before we go 
across the Rhine and move up, first I'd like to know

14:35.292 --> 14:52.556
a little bit about a forward observer's duty, 
exactly what you did. You were a lieutenant. How

14:54.759 --> 14:57.002
many people did you have on your staff? How did it 
work? Tell me how it worked. Fort observer is the

14:59.013 --> 15:01.557
artillery observer. He directs the artillery 
fire for the infantry or the tanks. And his job is to

15:06.704 --> 15:13.374
stay with the company commander of the infantry. 
Wherever he goes, that's where he goes. If the

15:16.539 --> 15:22.247
company commander says, okay, artillery 
observer, my first platoon is making an attack. He

15:22.327 --> 15:23.789
needs artillery fire. You go where that platoon is 
making the attack. Mm-hmm. And so. So you're

15:28.308 --> 15:31.132
always in the action and you're always calling in 
the gunfire. Gunfire, always calling artillery

15:31.213 --> 15:33.155
gunfire. Couple of times I'd look up and the 
infantry was behind me because they felt they

15:33.536 --> 15:40.566
ought to move back for some reason or another. And 
I'm sitting there directing artillery fire on a

15:40.586 --> 15:48.518
tank or a bunker or machine gun and being sniped at. 
And so the artillery observer, and what they'd do,

15:50.300 --> 15:56.830
they'd send us up for four or five days and didn't 
bring us back. The artillery would. And either we

16:00.707 --> 16:09.979
rested or we flew artillery fire from the L-5 or 
L-19 observation plane, which I hated. Didn't

16:09.999 --> 16:11.100
like it at all. Yeah, I didn't like that at all. I'm 
not much of flying in those days anyway. But the

16:19.450 --> 16:27.019
artillery observer

16:19.450 --> 16:27.019
stayed with the infantry or armored. Or the tank 
commander. Now, if you're a tank commander or

16:28.700 --> 16:35.049
observer, which I did once or twice, you rode third 
in line. Or the fourth. You're the fourth in line.

16:38.174 --> 16:40.297
The other three are armored people. And the 
artillery observer is the fourth one in line in his

16:40.337 --> 16:45.004
armored tank. But I always had a jeep. And I had a 
sergeant, a corporate radio operator, and a jeep

16:47.427 --> 16:52.114
driver. That was it. And I had an armored... So 
there wasn't anybody with a machine gun or

16:55.163 --> 16:57.627
anything? Oh, no. Oh, no. I had to depend on the 
infantry to protect me. Oh, no, we didn't have any

17:02.934 --> 17:05.859
security people at all. Besides the radio, did you 
carry arms? I carried a carbine,

17:11.327 --> 17:20.240
and then I got rid of that and got me one of these what 
you call a grease gun. It was a submachine gun. Oh, I

17:22.443 --> 17:22.783
see. I carried that. And then later on I got rid of 
that and it got to be cumbersome, so I got me a Luger,

17:24.644 --> 17:35.895
which I know I shouldn't be wearing a Luger, 
because if I ever got captured they'd shoot me

17:24.644 --> 17:35.895
immediately. But my car, my... Why is that? 
Because they knew it was a German Luger and they

17:39.559 --> 17:49.588
felt that I must have

17:39.559 --> 17:49.588
got it from somebody to get it, see. So this was a 
talk, you know. My crew followed me wherever I went

17:54.462 --> 18:06.275
and I had an armored, I had what we call a half track, 
also had all the radio communications in it.

18:09.258 --> 18:23.794
I would go forward of my radio operator and string a 
line and I would talk to him by phone and he would

18:09.258 --> 18:23.794
relay the commands back to the artillery, fire 
direction center. And they went through

18:24.668 --> 18:29.715
battalion, and they would direct the artillery 
for me. I'd give the commands. And what I learned at

18:32.099 --> 18:36.145
A&M in artillery is what I used in combat. Oh, yeah. 
I was delighted firing artillery fire, what I

18:38.488 --> 18:44.236
learned at A&M. Because I got a refreshing of it 
when I went to the field artillery school. What I

18:48.402 --> 18:53.730
learned at A&M was a foundation for my artillery 
firing. Okay, now let's go back to the Rhine again,

18:55.769 --> 19:02.837
and oh, I want to ask you another question dealing 
with this. And that is, did you ever see, meet, or

19:03.357 --> 19:14.349
form any opinions about the great generals of the 
WWII, Patton, Bradley, and Eisenhower? Yeah,

19:14.629 --> 19:17.632
Patton, you know, I thought was great. In fact, he 
drove up in the area where we were. Did you see him?

19:21.697 --> 19:22.077
Saw him. Talked to him, told him he shouldn't be up 
here. And he left. And he wanted to know where I was

19:27.614 --> 19:28.715
from. I told him, Texas A&M. He says, great school. 
Did he? Yeah. We wanted him to leave because he

19:33.721 --> 19:36.064
would draw fire. We didn't want to be fired upon. If 
the Germans found out he was in the area, man,

19:38.848 --> 19:43.413
they'd send the Air Force over. And then Bradley, 
of course. What did you think of him? I liked him. I

19:51.443 --> 19:52.084
thought he was great. What did you like about him? 
Just his bearing, just his confidence, the way he

19:55.562 --> 20:02.151
talked. I think he's a great American. I really do. 
Did you ever see that movie, Patton? Sure did. Oh,

20:07.017 --> 20:07.458
yeah. What did you think of that? Well, at times I 
thought they kind of overdid the slapping

20:08.780 --> 20:14.147
incident. I don't think that was as bad. Of course, 
I wasn't there to see it. But I'll tell you one

20:17.091 --> 20:19.935
thing. If you went from the 3rd Army area to the, 
Seventh Army area. You knew that you left the Third

20:24.034 --> 20:31.784
Army by the discipline and by the dress and by the 
way they maintained themselves. And of course,

20:32.344 --> 20:36.610
after that, we went to the Ninth Army, General 
Simpson. And General Simpson was a great general,

20:38.112 --> 20:41.156
too. But not as great as Patton. I thought it was 
just outstanding. What did you think of Bradley?

20:51.669 --> 20:52.530
Bradley was great. Oh yeah, I liked Bradley. We 
needed Bradley. He was one of those GI children. Is

21:00.992 --> 21:02.434
that what the troops thought at the time? Or is that 
just a label that some pressman gave them or

21:02.575 --> 21:07.343
something? No, no, that was at the time. Bradley 
was known as a low profile type, smart, looked

21:08.845 --> 21:14.836
after the men. Well Patton did too. Patton looked 
after his men. shoot, because he was more

21:18.565 --> 21:21.848
flamboyant. Yeah, for sure. Yeah. My general, 
Devine, was a small man, quiet. I was directing

21:31.338 --> 21:36.003
artillery fire over the Ruhr River before we got to 
the ride. And I was in a building on the third floor,

21:36.864 --> 21:41.108
looking behind a brick wall. The Germans were 300 
to 500 yards across the river, dug in. And I knocked

21:48.518 --> 21:52.522
a gun out. And so the Germans come out from their 
hold, and they unscrewed the barrel of the gun.

21:57.627 --> 22:00.991
They unscrewed and put a new one in there and then 
thumbed their nose at me. Really? Oh, yeah. And

22:02.352 --> 22:03.454
Devine was up there. General Devine was behind me, 
and he tapped me on the shoulder. He says,

22:06.577 --> 22:07.378
coconuts? What are you going to do about that? I 
said, I'm going to knock that damn thing out in a

22:09.039 --> 22:11.902
minute. It was in Stars and Stripes. Did you? Yes, 
we did. We knocked them out, but then we moved.

22:18.978 --> 22:20.499
During the night, we moved to... They didn't shoot 
at you? All the time. Oh, yeah. They were trying to

22:25.845 --> 22:27.226
shoot. They were trying to knock off your 
observation point. They knew I was somewhere in

22:30.529 --> 22:32.972
those buildings, but they didn't know where. They 
knew it. Oh, yeah, they were shooting me all the

22:35.674 --> 22:39.118
time. And Devine kind of left, so he left. And I'll 
tell you an interesting thing. I just thought

22:45.784 --> 22:47.986
about it. On the Ruhr River... And I guess Devine 
was there, and then he left. The next day I got a call

22:53.355 --> 22:58.962
to come see General Devine and bring your crew. So I 
took my crew. Well, General Devine had to go to Army

23:01.765 --> 23:06.972
Headquarters, so he wasn't there. But his chief of 
staff says, you and your crew are going to Paris for

23:07.933 --> 23:13.219
five days. I said, what for? He says, the general 
said to give you a five-day pass to Paris, as you

23:15.081 --> 23:19.647
are. and to make a report on it when you get back. So 
we went, as we were, just, you know, hadn't shaved a

23:24.809 --> 23:32.380
couple of days, dirty, filthy, really hungry. So 
we jumped in three quarters of a ton, and we took off

23:33.001 --> 23:39.430
for Paris, and it took us about 18, 20 hours to get 
there. And we got there at the hotel. They were

23:43.395 --> 23:44.216
waiting for us. No kidding. Yes, and you were... He 
set it up for us? Oh, yeah, he set it up for us. I also

23:48.042 --> 23:49.043
thought you were great. And they gave us new 
clothes. They gave us a steam room. And, of course,

23:54.932 --> 23:56.834
we bathed and shaved. And then we went downstairs 
and they had a table laid out for us. They said, this

24:02.719 --> 24:07.244
is what we're going to do for the first night, and 
then after that you're on your own. So, of course,

24:08.084 --> 24:14.911
we played in Paris for three days, and then the 
fourth day we went back. So when I got back, Had to

24:18.959 --> 24:19.920
make a report. Said, how'd you like Paris? Oh, it's 
wonderful, boy. Just crazy about Paris. Said,

24:24.948 --> 24:25.849
well, how do you feel? I feel like staying in Paris. 
Yeah. Said, do you feel the same way now that you did

24:30.496 --> 24:33.840
before you left? I said, no, different. I don't 
feel the same way. Before I left, I was ready to

24:37.025 --> 24:38.567
fight. You know, I'd do anything. But now, since 
I've had this five-day period here of rest in

24:40.971 --> 24:47.380
Paris, I got a different feeling about combat. And 
what was it then, your feeling? Then? What was that

24:54.919 --> 24:56.041
different feeling? Feeling scared, didn't want 
to go back. And so then I said, okay. So they didn't

25:02.510 --> 25:03.632
do that anymore. Too much to lose. Yeah, that's 
right. Exactly. They didn't, they cut that. See,

25:08.739 --> 25:13.646
they were going to take different groups, 
different sections, and send them to Paris. And

25:15.108 --> 25:15.649
they cut it. I told them not to do it. I said, don't do 
that. If you want to arrest a guy, pull him back for a

25:18.010 --> 25:23.958
day or two and put him behind, right here behind the 
lines. Don't take him out of this environment. If

25:26.702 --> 25:34.773
you take him out of this environment, you lose all 
the continuity of fighting and the continuity of

25:26.702 --> 25:34.773
warfare. And you throw him in a different world, 
and he comes back, and he's all screwed up. And

25:40.121 --> 25:41.142
that's what happened to us. My sergeant and them, 
they wanted it. ready to go into combat. I said,

25:49.518 --> 25:50.659
man, we got to go. We got a job to do. And that's where 
my A&M training came in. Had a job to do. Even though

25:55.524 --> 26:00.629
I wasn't acclimated to doing that again, do it like 
I did before. But I said, we have a job to do. We got to

26:02.971 --> 26:05.113
do it. And my A&M training just says, do it, period. 
And it took me, to tell you the truth, I guess it took

26:08.777 --> 26:14.843
me, hell, I never got over it, I guess, you know. But 
describe Paris during that time. When was this,

26:17.689 --> 26:18.850
January 45? Right. Oh, it was great. About the 
first February of 45. Oh, it was, everybody was

26:23.114 --> 26:26.698
happy and having a big time. Americans, so you walk 
down the street and everybody wanted to buy them a

26:26.718 --> 26:30.422
drink. Really? Oh, yeah. The girls were all over 
you. Incidentally, I was single at the time. My

26:36.247 --> 26:37.408
wife can't fuss that. But, oh, yeah, they were 
very, grateful for the Americans. Couldn't do

26:46.579 --> 26:47.440
nothing wrong. Wanted to take you out and feed you 
and wine you. Oh yeah, going to a bar and people just

26:51.784 --> 26:56.109
all over you. But I got back into combat and crossed 
the Rhine River after that and I was all right. I

27:05.838 --> 27:10.743
crossed the Rhine River and I was the only 
artillery observer, only man in the 8th Army

27:05.838 --> 27:10.743
Division that crossed. The rest of them sitting 
back supporting. You were just out there all by

27:14.442 --> 27:15.844
yourself? All by myself. I was with the 75th 
Division. I was there. And everybody else was on

27:20.130 --> 27:22.053
the other side? The other side. Crossing Orion was 
like crossing the English Channel. It was an

27:28.122 --> 27:29.044
invasion. It was just as wide, I believe. God, they 
smoked it all up. And we crossed. And I had to direct

27:35.613 --> 27:41.923
the artillery fire for the 75th Division. We were 
supporting them. And I was the only 8th Armored

27:44.986 --> 27:49.272
Division man to cross the river. Everybody else 
was back poised, ready to go. Then they crossed at

27:52.616 --> 27:53.778
Wessel. So in other words, they put you over first. 
Right, as the artillery observed. I was selected,

27:59.386 --> 28:10.781
which I didn't want that honor, to go with the 
invading elements for the 8th Armored Division.

28:10.802 --> 28:14.807
Yeah, we got a history that tells all about that. 
But I didn't want that honor. They could have given

28:17.223 --> 28:20.025
it to somebody else. But it crossed the Rhine, and 
then we got into the rural. Well, how was the

28:22.748 --> 28:24.209
fighting at that time? It was pretty rough. The 
rural pockets, see, we had rural pockets. The

28:30.154 --> 28:31.255
Germans were trapped. And boy, they were 
suicidal. They wanted to get out. So we did get the

28:35.599 --> 28:36.800
word. The division, after the 8th Army Division 
crossed, and we were fighting, they got the word to

28:36.960 --> 28:44.727
let Darmstead, to let an opening so the Germans 
could get out. Because it would have been suicide

28:48.295 --> 28:52.621
for everybody. So they opened the pocket up on the 
east and let them move back. Yeah, let them move out

28:58.531 --> 28:59.652
of there. But it didn't demand surrender. They 
wouldn't surrender. They wouldn't surrender.

29:06.182 --> 29:07.364
They didn't surrender. They wouldn't surrender 
any time, except right the last on the Elbe River,

29:07.424 --> 29:13.093
just before we got to the Elbe, they started 
surrendering. and they wanted to help us to go

29:13.799 --> 29:16.043
fight the Russians. But the rear pocket,

29:17.004 --> 29:38.559
we hit a bank in Darmstadt, Darmstadt, and money 
all over the place, German Reich money, and direct

29:17.004 --> 29:38.559
and artillery fire, and we just kept going. Once 
you got into Germany, How did the German civilians

29:41.390 --> 29:46.154
treat you? Did you ever even notice them? They 
didn't really notice them. They didn't pay

29:49.157 --> 29:51.198
attention to them. If they went through a town and 
they had white flags flying, we just kept going.

29:58.605 --> 29:58.805
Yeah. It was the Hitlerjugend that gave us a lot of 
trouble. Oh, they did? Oh, yeah. Would you explain

30:02.388 --> 30:03.809
that? Well, they wouldn't, they would, like we 
took one town to Hilton, they wouldn't. Anyway, we

30:13.047 --> 30:15.650
secured the town. But the Hitlerjugend were all 
stuck up in the buildings, and they kept fighting.

30:21.416 --> 30:22.137
They wouldn't give up. In fact, they hit one of our 
lieutenants in the armory. He was riding on top of

30:27.443 --> 30:28.965
his tank. They hit him with a Panzerfaust. That's a 
bazooka right in the back. And they were like, we

30:34.551 --> 30:35.792
weren't fighting. He was just riding. We thought 
the town was secure. It's like terrorist type

30:38.575 --> 30:41.839
thing. And where we went, the Hitlerjugend just 
fanatically fought and fought. They wouldn't

30:46.669 --> 30:47.410
quit. They wouldn't give up. And the war was over, 
almost. And how old were these kids? 15, 16. In

30:53.979 --> 31:04.333
fact, when we got to the Elbe River, they turned us 
around and put us in the Hearts Mountain to dig out

30:53.979 --> 31:04.333
the Hitlerjugend kids. And we would capture them, 
and they were 14, 15, 16 years old, like my little

31:04.353 --> 31:12.484
son Christopher, 16 years old. They wouldn't 
quit. They just kept fighting.

31:24.107 --> 31:30.255
Now, toward the end of the war, you were assigned to 
occupation duty. Yes. Tell me about that. This is

31:35.401 --> 31:36.342
when? They surrendered in May of 1945. Okay, they 
surrendered. They sent us to Czechoslovakia. 8th

31:42.957 --> 31:43.938
Armored Division. We went there not as occupation 
but as liberate. And so we stayed in

31:51.107 --> 32:02.302
Czechoslovakia until August or the middle of July 
and they moved us. They sent the 8th Armored

32:02.322 --> 32:12.154
Division home and I was sent to the 26th Division in 
Austria and that's where we occupied the country.

32:13.096 --> 32:30.661
And I was in charge of what they call the Cumberland 
Displaced Person Camps in up Austria, near

32:13.096 --> 32:30.661
Gmunden, near the Sea of Gmunden, or the Lake of 
Gmunden. It was right outside of Lenz, Austria.

32:36.149 --> 32:42.799
And we had three displaced camps, DP camps, 
displaced person camps. And my job was to take care

32:43.471 --> 32:55.806
of them, feed them, clothe them, delouse them in 
reverse order, and put them in boxcars and send

32:43.471 --> 32:55.806
them back to Russia. These were all Russian 
displaced people. They were all Russians. All

32:59.110 --> 33:00.052
white Russians. And my job. Were they former 
civilians or military men? No, they were

33:07.841 --> 33:09.563
civilians. These were civilians. They were lucky 
then. They were in the slave labor camps. Oh, I see.

33:16.833 --> 33:20.699
Okay, so these people were in a slave labor camp 
because of Hitler. Of course, that's right. And

33:22.862 --> 33:24.184
they were white Russians. Does that mean 
anything? No. It means that the communist

33:27.428 --> 33:37.182
Russians wanted them back and just continue what 
they've been doing, slave laborers or what. And my

33:37.202 --> 33:42.469
job was to get them on boxcars and send them back, 
which was terrible. they knew it they knew they

33:43.090 --> 34:12.591
knew they were going to go to Siberia or kill get 
killed they knew it but she has my A&M training

33:43.090 --> 34:12.591
again it's my job and as much as I I did the best I 
could to make it comfortable for them fed them took

33:43.090 --> 34:12.591
care of them I would imagine they were in really 
poorly poor physical condition malnutrition by

33:43.090 --> 34:12.591
the time you got a hold of them weren't they they 
were terrible really skinny skinny and

34:13.465 --> 34:17.411
undernourished, but we fattened them up pretty 
good. We fed them good, gave them good medical

34:17.511 --> 34:22.299
treatment. And how many were in each of these three 
camps? There's a hundred thousand of them. A

34:25.945 --> 34:28.048
hundred thousand and you were in charge of those? I 
was in charge of them. Of all hundred thousand? Of

34:30.191 --> 34:31.594
all hundred thousand. And what was your rank by 
then? I was the first lieutenant. In charge of a

34:35.159 --> 34:37.102
hundred thousand displaced people. That was a 
heck of a lot of responsibility. It was. It was. Why

34:40.583 --> 34:41.104
didn't they? I would imagine that they would have 
taken somebody of higher rank. Oh, I would think so

34:44.189 --> 34:45.070
too. In fact, they had a lieutenant colonel who was 
in charge of it before I got there. Oh,

34:50.338 --> 34:52.782
incidentally, I got a battlefield promotion. I 
forgot to tell you that. In the Battle of the Bulge.

34:56.088 --> 35:00.294
I got promoted from second lieutenant on the field 
of battle to first lieutenant. See, there was no

35:00.314 --> 35:04.781
rank for my job as a first lieutenant. And so the 
general came up, Devine came up with, and they

35:08.714 --> 35:10.597
promoted me to first lieutenant. Is this after you 
got the Silver Star? It was after the Silver Star.

35:15.664 --> 35:20.170
It was cited just like a citation. They had to write 
up a citation like they would the Silver Star, why

35:20.210 --> 35:26.740
they promoted me to first lieutenant. I know we're 
off the subject for a minute, but it was because I

35:27.641 --> 35:34.671
was up for three or four days without food and water 
and direct an artillery fire line drive to the

35:35.005 --> 35:44.818
rural river or to the Rhine after the Battle of the 
Bulge. Without food and without water? Yeah,

35:47.742 --> 35:52.989
well, we had canteen without rest, without sleep. 
For three straight days? Three straight days. Why

35:56.034 --> 35:57.335
didn't they give you another medal? No. That's 
usually what the military does, isn't it? Instead

36:02.596 --> 36:04.298
of a promotion? Well, let me tell you, Terry. I 
wasn't going to bring that up, but we were in a

36:07.241 --> 36:21.817
battle after the bulge, and

36:07.241 --> 36:21.817
it was about two weeks later we were in a battle. 
Which one, the Ardennes? This was later than the

36:23.699 --> 36:25.061
Ardennes. It was on the way to the Rhine, near 
Muechen-Gladbach.

36:33.258 --> 36:37.863
I had a very dear friend who was the armored 
artillery observer. He's the guy who rode in the

36:37.963 --> 36:41.006
fourth tank. And so my infantry company was held in 
reserve that was in this fight. And so they were

36:51.537 --> 36:53.760
ready to go any time. So rather than stay with them, 
I went on up to the front to see how Bill Hamner was

36:54.680 --> 37:00.126
doing. He's Lieutenant Hamner. And he was in the 
fourth and they were fighting a battle with the 81

37:03.734 --> 37:06.977
millimeter mortars. And when I got up at this 
farmhouse where the infantry commander was, the

37:07.898 --> 37:17.869
battalion commander, I said, y'all seen 
Lieutenant Havner? He said, oh yeah, haven't you

37:18.570 --> 37:19.931
heard? I said, no. He said, look across the road. 
And that was about like looking at that house over

37:22.755 --> 37:27.540
there, looking across the street and looking at 
that house. He said, and his tank was smoldering.

37:31.679 --> 37:34.364
See, that's Lieutenant Hamner. I said, well, 
where in the hell's Bill and his crew? He says, we

37:38.812 --> 37:39.593
don't know. I said, where are the medics? He says, 
they can't get over there. That street right there

37:44.241 --> 37:47.928
is just full of fire. I said, oh, come on now. 
Somebody's got to go get them. Nothing we can do

37:52.570 --> 37:53.551
about it. Every time we get out there, they riddle 
the street with mortar fire or 81s or machine gun

37:53.591 --> 37:59.719
fire. He says, you can't get across there. I said, 
the hell you can't get across there. I'll show you

38:03.744 --> 38:05.265
how to get across there. And I went across that 
field of fire and found Hamner in the ditch.

38:11.873 --> 38:12.875
Weren't they shooting at you? Yeah. They were 
shooting all around me. And found Hamner. What

38:18.719 --> 38:20.462
kind of ammunition? Machine guns? I don't know. It 
was mortars and everything. The mortars were just

38:23.967 --> 38:25.149
popping. But I ran across that ditch, and I found 
Bill Hamner in the ditch. He had been thrown from

38:32.920 --> 38:34.202
the tank? He had crawled out of the damn tank, and I 
said, BAM! And he had taken his helmet and put it

38:39.590 --> 38:43.115
over his face. He was conscious. And I flicked his 
hand in the back. I said, Bill! He said, oh, you

38:50.016 --> 38:52.779
goddamn Greek, where in the hell you been? You 
know? Yeah! He said, where in the hell you been? I

38:57.384 --> 38:59.507
said, what's the matter, Bill? He said, you're 
about to make me cry. He said, he said, goddamn,

39:01.629 --> 39:05.333
I've been waiting for you. He says, them son of a 
bitches are not doing nothing for me. I said, okay,

39:09.655 --> 39:10.977
I'll take care of you. He says, oh, I don't think I'm 
going to make it. I said, oh, yeah, you will, Bill.

39:14.842 --> 39:15.964
We were good friends. We were in training in Fort 
Polk. I said, where's Sudie and Corporal

39:21.030 --> 39:23.554
Hannigan? He says, I don't know. I said, okay. So I 
put this helmet back on him, and I took off my belt,

39:26.918 --> 39:32.065
and his leg was just shot up. And I took my belt off, 
and I put a tourniquet because he was bleeding. And

39:37.567 --> 39:42.474
I took off my first aid pack, and we had penicillin. 
So penicillin did real good. And I said, just sit

39:44.858 --> 39:48.343
still, Bill. So I crawled around the tank, and I 
found Sergeant Sudie. And I took his leg. His left

39:56.135 --> 39:57.236
leg was shot. And I took his belt off and put a 
tourniquet on there. And then the other carpal was

40:00.842 --> 40:05.008
shot in the chest here. and a couple other places 
armed, and he was pretty well shot up. And I took my

40:11.558 --> 40:18.789
morphine syrettes out, and I administered 
morphine to each one of them, and then marked their

40:11.558 --> 40:18.789
heads. And then I said, look. And I pulled them, and 
pulled them behind the tank to where the Germans

40:22.374 --> 40:28.463
couldn't hit them. I said, just sit right here. He 
said, I'll be back. And so Bill was the most

40:32.866 --> 40:36.930
crucial, seriously hit one. I didn't know what I 
was going to do with him. And how the hell I was going

40:39.232 --> 40:42.715
to get him out of there, because I couldn't carry 
him across that road. Because hell, we would all be

40:43.696 --> 40:46.518
killed. So I stood over there, and my battery 
commander, Lieutenant Kuntz from Purdue,

40:46.538 --> 40:57.448
he came up to the farmhouse. And I could see him. I 
said, Kuntz. Where you at? I said, I'm over here in

41:03.166 --> 41:04.627
this ditch. I says, go get the Jeep and back it down 
the road and back it as fast as you can. And I'm going

41:12.614 --> 41:16.718
to pick Bill up, and I'll get him on the Jeep. And 
then you take off. OK. So he got my Jeep. How could he

41:20.782 --> 41:22.843
go down that road with all that fire? Well, see, 
where the tank was. Was below? Was down kind of a

41:26.887 --> 41:30.651
little dip, and there's a little hill. Oh, I see. 
See, a little hill. And once you got behind that

41:32.772 --> 41:36.318
hill, then the Germans could hit you. But when you 
got behind on the other side, they couldn't see

41:36.338 --> 41:39.163
you. I see. But the tank was sitting right at this 
little convex thing. And so he goes, and he gets the

41:44.893 --> 41:48.539
jeep, and he backs it. We were hand signaling each 
other. And I said, come on. And so he backed the jeep

41:53.067 --> 41:56.333
up, my jeep. And when he did, I picked Bill Hamner 
up, who was six foot and weighed about 165 pounds. I

42:03.382 --> 42:09.832
picked him up and threw him back of the Jeep. And 
when he did, he grabbed the tire. And I said, hold on

42:14.039 --> 42:15.962
to the tire, Bill. And I said, Koontz, take off. And 
Koontz took off. And the German mortar was just

42:22.412 --> 42:24.615
right behind him. Oh, and I'm sitting there in the 
ditch watching all this, you know. So he'd take

42:30.362 --> 42:37.591
off, and so the

42:30.362 --> 42:37.591
other two listening men were sitting there. I 
said, how in the hell am I going to get them out of

42:38.432 --> 42:40.515
here? They were hit pretty bad. So it was getting 
dark. So I said, okay, we'll wait until dark. We'll

42:49.246 --> 42:51.970
get the medics to bring the litter over. and we'll 
put you on it and shun off." That's what we did. It

42:54.943 --> 42:59.250
didn't take long, about 20-30 minutes it got dark. 
I was afraid Bill would bleed to death, that's why

42:59.330 --> 43:03.777
we had to get him out. So we got the two men over there 
and the medics took them back. I stayed and

43:09.446 --> 43:16.658
directed artillery fire on the Germans.

43:18.308 --> 43:27.336
Coontz takes Hamner back, and Hamner passes out, 
and they get him in the evacuation line, and they

43:18.308 --> 43:27.336
get him all back to England. They gave Coontz the 
Silver Star. Really? Yeah. And the battalion

43:32.021 --> 43:34.002
commander came to me. See, it didn't bother me 
until the battalion commander came up to me and

43:34.042 --> 43:47.174
says, well, we would have given you the Silver Star 
because we understand what you did and

43:34.042 --> 43:47.174
everything, but you already had one. I said, oh. I 
said, I wish you hadn't have told me that, Colonel

43:48.211 --> 43:50.694
Dawson. His name was Dawson, Colonel Dawson. I 
said, well, you had one. We'll just pass it around

43:53.857 --> 43:55.659
to somebody else. I said, well, I said, well, the 
Army, I said, the Army's not that hard up for Silver

43:57.020 --> 44:03.727
Stars. But anyway, you know, you're talking about 
medals, not getting the medal. They gave Kuntz the

44:11.955 --> 44:14.618
medal. And it's written up there. Did he live? Oh, 
yeah. Hamler lived. And he came back, and half his

44:18.468 --> 44:20.890
leg shot off. And he came to Beaumont, Texas. Came 
to see me about 1953. Catherine and I just got

44:26.256 --> 44:28.338
married. And he stayed with me for a while here. And 
he went to Detroit. I mean, to California. He's

44:33.283 --> 44:35.205
living in California now. We haven't 
corresponded in a long time. But he lived, and he

44:38.268 --> 44:45.996
came, and he says, what's the name of your paper 
here? I said, Beaumont Enterprise. So he went down

44:48.843 --> 44:51.627
to the Bowman Enterprise and told them the story. 
And they had a big write-up in the paper. Oh, yeah.

44:57.595 --> 45:00.780
But Hammer was quite a guy.

45:05.507 --> 45:06.768
I've forgotten all about it. That's a fantastic 
story. Yeah. When you said about metal, that

45:09.092 --> 45:12.717
reminded me of this. It's in our 8th Armored thing. 
Well, and was it right after this experience that

45:16.973 --> 45:24.163
they gave you the battlefield promotion? Did this 
have anything to do with that? No, no. This was

45:27.829 --> 45:29.711
after my battlefield promotion. That's what 
prompted me to give you the story, because you said

45:30.593 --> 45:34.859
I should have got a medal for the battle. Right. 
Yeah, I should have got a medal for that, I guess.

45:39.806 --> 45:44.753
But no, I got the battlefield promotion right 
after riding the bulls with... Colonel Poirnier

45:45.222 --> 45:46.864
right after that. And that one, now explain that. 
That was for being three days. Yeah, without

45:51.288 --> 45:57.675
resting and directing the infantry column. How 
could you stay awake? I don't know. I'd nod, you

46:00.178 --> 46:03.061
know, during the day or something. But I was busy, 
you know? Yeah, right, continually. Yeah, I

46:07.565 --> 46:08.967
didn't realize it. I was busy all the time. But 
Hammer lived. Sergeant Sooty died. And the other

46:16.424 --> 46:18.086
corporal lived. Soon he died, though, several 
years later. He never got over his complications,

46:20.969 --> 46:26.034
began to sit in. He got torn up on the inside. And he 
never could really take care of it. About like

46:33.922 --> 46:36.644
Brady's head, you know. He had bullet ricochets.

46:41.709 --> 46:46.414
But Bill lives in California now, living in good 
shape. Then

46:47.018 --> 46:59.627
we went on to the Rhine River and we crossed the 
Rhine, went into the Ruhr Pocket, then we went into

46:47.018 --> 46:59.627
the occupation.
