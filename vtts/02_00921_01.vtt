The history of planning in Fort Worth. March 15th, 
interviewer Lance Freeman interviewing Emil R.

00:07.830 --> 00:26.646
Montsevice, senior planner in urban design, the 
planning department, the city of Fort Worth.

00:28.398 --> 00:42.144
Okay, Mr. Montsevice, I wondered if you could 
please give us a brief biographical sketch of your

00:28.398 --> 00:42.144
life in planning, especially, and how you got to 
where you are right now. Okay, I graduated from

00:43.266 --> 00:46.592
Texas A&M with a And bachelors

00:47.382 --> 01:03.580
of architecture degree in 1966.

01:03.600 --> 01:11.028
Went to City Council town for three years. And got 
back out and went back and did a master's in turbine

01:11.048 --> 01:13.811
and regional planning in 1970. Graduated back in 
1971. Came to work for the city of Fort Worth in 71.

01:15.253 --> 01:17.355
Worked for two years for the city of Fort Worth as an 
associate planner. And

01:18.449 --> 01:43.076
then I went to work for the city of El Paso as a senior 
planner for up until 1981. Then I came back as a

01:43.096 --> 01:44.537
senior planner to work for the city of Fort Worth. 
And that's where I am now, involved with design,

01:44.557 --> 01:46.339
urban design, and also company planning. I have a 
staff of about six

01:47.575 --> 02:14.072
planners that are responsible

01:47.575 --> 02:14.072
for, you know, comprehensive plans for the city, 
responsible for reviewing the flats, zoning

01:47.575 --> 02:14.072
cases, and I also work with another section of the 
planning department in terms of implementing

01:47.575 --> 02:14.072
urban design projects in areas where we may have 
federal funds to develop those type of projects to

01:47.575 --> 02:14.072
help the community. Generally, that's where I am 
at this point. OK. Going back all the way to the

02:20.077 --> 02:30.431
history, when was the first legislative 
authorization of a comprehensive plan in your

02:20.077 --> 02:30.431
community? I was looking at some of the history. It 
was part of the Bartholomew plan that was done in

02:34.596 --> 02:41.005
1927.

02:41.879 --> 02:44.542
generally probably would be to take. There was a 
Keshav plan done prior to that in 1909, but that was

02:44.562 --> 02:52.931
more of a part-time rather than a comprehensive 
plan. Do you see any effects today from that

02:52.951 --> 02:57.677
Bartholomew plan? I could not. Do you? OK. Is 
there, number three, is there any systematic

03:02.082 --> 03:09.490
periodic review of your city's comprehensive 
plan? Yes, we generally, we did comprehensive

03:10.600 --> 03:33.630
planning,

03:10.600 --> 03:33.630
we did what we call a major comprehensive plan back 
in the early 70s, and it was undertaken by

03:10.600 --> 03:33.630
developing a number of sectors within the 
communities, generally about 11 sectors. What we

03:33.650 --> 03:34.431
did, we We sent out flyers and got people 
interested

03:35.002 --> 03:58.305
in coming to talk about their city and the plans for 
the future growth and development of the

03:35.002 --> 03:58.305
community and set up a committee and that 
particular committee had their own members and

03:35.002 --> 03:58.305
they worked with us. We developed base 
information, developed a plan, went out and

03:58.326 --> 04:04.772
talked to them about it, show them what the effects 
were and so forth and worked on it. generally

04:05.731 --> 04:27.059
on probably on a biweekly basis having meetings by 
doing the analysis and bringing that

04:05.731 --> 04:27.059
information, showing what it meant, and going 
back to them, coming up with a plan, working with

04:05.731 --> 04:27.059
them. So that was the way it was set up. And again, 
about two years ago, 1981, again we went through

04:27.961 --> 04:33.628
the same process of doing that and used the same 
type of system setting up a sector planning

04:34.958 --> 04:51.752
process

04:34.958 --> 04:51.752
and working with the citizens, trying to solicit 
people of different concerns such as homeowners,

04:34.958 --> 04:51.752
developers, economists. And try to have really 
everybody's input into this process and trying to

04:52.188 --> 05:01.881
have a basis for a plan. So you had a different plan 
for each sector. Right. And then you combined all

05:05.026 --> 05:07.729
of those. Right. That is our comprehensive plan. 
OK. Presently, when Bob, I don't know, do you want

05:13.718 --> 05:16.642
to get into the present right now? Yes, why not? 
Presently, we're involved in the center. We've

05:22.188 --> 05:24.070
just finished that process. It's what we call a 
sector process. But we're also getting involved

05:26.433 --> 05:30.157
in what we call district planning. That's the 
outlined areas that are sort of where most of the

05:30.177 --> 05:35.704
new development is going on. And we're hoping to 
develop a plan for that area. But that will

05:37.626 --> 05:45.516
probably not entail so much input from citizen 
participation because, again, in those areas,

05:37.626 --> 05:45.516
there's really but not that

05:46.036 --> 05:54.676
much population. So what we're really looking at 
is what development has occurred and what has

05:55.458 --> 05:59.187
caused that development. And we're trying to more 
or less look in an area in terms of what man-made and

06:01.055 --> 06:14.834
natural elements to tell you what a piece of 
property can be utilized for and trying to come up

06:01.055 --> 06:14.834
with different alternatives for different 
pieces of property. You might have, for example,

06:14.854 --> 06:24.868
an area that could have a commercial use or it could 
have an industrial

06:14.854 --> 06:24.868
use. ETJ, extraterritorial jurisdiction, but it 
also includes parts of the community that are in

06:29.928 --> 06:37.897
the city is a combination of both. But what we're 
trying to do is be more realistic in terms of the

06:37.917 --> 06:51.092
market out there to try to say what really what land 
can be used for and then develop these different

06:37.917 --> 06:51.092
what we call scenarios or alternatives. So one 
particular scenario begins in that area then that

06:54.532 --> 07:20.944
should end up being a plan for that particular area 
and it'll sort of change everything else you know

06:54.532 --> 07:20.944
what i'm saying in other words okay rather than 
being adamant and saying well we're going to make

06:54.532 --> 07:20.944
this you know typically all plans have always 
shown everything single family you know just

06:54.532 --> 07:20.944
about but what we're really looking at is from the 
site planning board is what would really work and

06:54.532 --> 07:20.944
what would be the highest and best Okay.

07:24.879 --> 07:31.028
Have you been using any computer models in 
developing these plants? Not necessarily these

07:31.048 --> 07:39.220
plants, but we have used the computer model in the 
study that we did for the Southwest Corridor,

07:41.782 --> 07:48.489
analysis of the southwest freeway, in other 
words, where it should go and why it should go that

07:41.782 --> 07:48.489
way. Okay, so mostly transportation. Yeah, what 
kind of problems would we encounter on all our

07:50.311 --> 07:59.742
other major arterial systems.

08:00.062 --> 08:03.486
Has your community's comprehensive plan ever 
been revised? And if so, how does this revision

08:04.387 --> 08:07.170
take place? Okay. What we're trying to start out 
now is to revise our plan, what we call ongoing

08:09.322 --> 08:16.697
planning. Once a major new development comes into 
an area that has changed the plan completely, we go

08:17.198 --> 08:25.314
back and look and reanalyze. And we're trying to do 
this on a continuing basis rather than, say, every

08:25.976 --> 08:29.804
10 years. Rather than be static. to

08:31.327 --> 08:44.713
continue to be in motion in terms of changing with 
the times. And that's the way we're approaching

08:44.733 --> 08:46.516
it. So even the plans that we had done in the last two 
years, we've come back and looked at some other

08:46.536 --> 08:50.504
areas and made changes to the original plan that we 
did simply to keep up with what's going on. OK. And

08:52.690 --> 09:09.070
most, well I won't say most, but many of these 
changes are really initiated by, again,

08:52.690 --> 09:09.070
development in the community, the market, what's 
happening in the private sector, you know, that

08:52.690 --> 09:09.070
causes this type of thing. I'll take one of the 
biggest things to point out here for instance that

09:09.090 --> 09:22.005
the final decision to go with the Southwest 
Freeway alignment has caused some major changes

09:09.090 --> 09:22.005
in that area in terms of land use and the proposed 
zoning and land use. for the plants that were there

09:22.745 --> 09:25.308
previously. So we've really made a major change in 
all that area. Okay. Down to question number

09:33.839 --> 09:35.982
seven. What administrative procedures and 
planning program elements does your community

09:36.002 --> 09:44.894
have for implementing community plans? That's 
probably no different than any other community in

09:45.475 --> 09:52.684
that you've got a zoning commission and a planning 
commission. We received a class and some cases

09:53.086 --> 10:16.870
that come through the system here and we revise and 
review those and look at it in terms of the

09:53.086 --> 10:16.870
comprehensive plan that we have developed and 
make a judgment in terms of, you know, is this good

09:53.086 --> 10:16.870
or bad for the plan or what are some of the problems 
with it or what are the good things about it. We also

10:16.890 --> 10:17.811
have another section which is more 
implementation section of the planning

10:18.314 --> 10:37.719
department that is involved

10:18.314 --> 10:37.719
with the federal programs, which get more 
planning on the neighborhood level, I would say.

10:37.739 --> 10:40.322
And we're looking at the comprehensive plan that 
we've done for those areas. Their work is a little

10:40.623 --> 10:42.585
more detailed in this aspect. And what we try to do 
is when we get zoning cases or thoughts We look at it

10:45.078 --> 11:06.305
in terms of what are those detailed plans for those 
areas and does it fit,

10:45.078 --> 11:06.305
you know, the overall plan for that community. In 
other words, is it going against what the basic

11:06.325 --> 11:09.228
goals of the area are in terms of the development 
for the area? Is it going to be positive or

11:09.248 --> 11:10.029
negative? We use that many times. In zoning cases 
where we want to make a point where we see there

11:11.131 --> 11:14.595
might be a detriment to the area if there's an 
intrusion of commercial or industrial

11:15.031 --> 11:28.428
into a residential area. Okay, good. Our 
department is basically related directly to who

11:29.329 --> 11:37.160
worked for the zoning commission and also the city 
of Fort Worth had a zoning commission and a

11:29.329 --> 11:37.160
planning commission. They're two different 
commissions. Generally in Texas you have one with

11:38.702 --> 11:43.688
P and Z, but for some reason Fort Worth wanted to be a 
little bit... We work directly for

11:44.005 --> 12:01.412
those two commissions.

12:01.432 --> 12:11.408
We make reviews of zoning cases and those staff 
reports go to the zoning commission and we make a

12:01.432 --> 12:11.408
general discussion about the case for the 
positive and negative aspects of the zoning

12:01.432 --> 12:11.408
request. We do. work

12:12.153 --> 12:35.171
on

12:12.153 --> 12:35.171
being

12:12.153 --> 12:35.171
directed for the Planning Commission and that we 
review all the clats and make a judgment in terms of

12:12.153 --> 12:35.171
what we think might be some of the problems with the 
clats and what changes we need to take. We look at it

12:35.191 --> 12:38.076
in terms of how those clats fit in with our National 
Territory Plan and that information is given over

12:35.191 --> 12:38.076
to the Planning Commission. Who makes up these 
commissions? Are they the citizens? The

12:44.094 --> 12:50.103
commissions

12:44.094 --> 12:50.103
are appointed by city council members. Generally 
what we have, and this was instituted probably

12:50.123 --> 12:57.754
about a year ago, where each particular board 
would have nine members. So each councilman and

12:57.774 --> 13:07.228
each mayor would have one vote to appoint somebody 
on these boards. It seems to be people

13:07.248 --> 13:08.991
representation for the community. Is there a city 
manager in Fort Worth? Yes,

13:14.697 --> 13:26.388
there's a city manager.

13:26.408 --> 13:33.055
Our director, plane director, is the, you know, I 
was supervised by the assistant city manager, who

13:26.408 --> 13:33.055
is, again, supervised by the city manager. So 
that's the order. City manager, assistant city

13:34.356 --> 13:35.877
manager, plane department, and ourselves. But 
again, we relay the record to these two boards and

13:35.897 --> 13:38.640
our responsibility to them. If they are 
requesting certain studies or something, they

13:40.426 --> 13:44.411
can request it. They don't have to go to the city 
manager and request the city manager to . They go

13:48.616 --> 13:49.537
straight to you. Yeah,

13:49.557 --> 13:53.441
. OK. Let's go back to question number nine. How 
many professional planners does your city employ

13:56.845 --> 13:59.949
now? And could you please break them up into their 
groups? Actually, we have generally two

14:04.374 --> 14:09.640
sections. One, again, is the advanced planning, 
which is more involved with comprehensive

14:10.328 --> 14:30.405
planning and urban design. And we have the other 
section, which is implementation planning,

14:30.425 --> 14:37.772
which is more involved with federal programs such 
as Community Development Block Grant, UDAGS. I

14:37.792 --> 14:39.373
can't even think of this other program called It's 
a jobs program that they have. I couldn't think of

14:48.667 --> 14:54.317
the name of it. But they're more related to social 
programs and implementation programs from an

14:54.337 --> 15:06.036
economic point of view and jobs programs. Whereas 
the other department, the advanced planning, has

15:07.450 --> 15:11.295
to do with it. No, they're the same section. This is 
the planning department. We have two sections.

15:14.759 --> 15:16.821
One would be the advanced planning. And advanced 
planning would be more of the physical aspects?

15:21.086 --> 15:27.614
Yeah, the comprehensive

15:21.086 --> 15:27.614
planning part. In our section, advanced 
planning, we have approximately, let's say, six,

15:27.714 --> 15:36.765
seven, 10 people,

15:37.977 --> 15:58.687
I'm going

15:37.977 --> 15:58.687
to say 11

15:37.977 --> 15:58.687
people

15:37.977 --> 15:58.687
involved with comprehensive planning. That 
includes transportation planners, two

15:58.707 --> 16:04.856
transportation planners, six or seven 
comprehensive planners, and of course, one

15:58.707 --> 16:04.856
assistant director, and of course, the general 
director. On the other side, with the

16:04.876 --> 16:07.680
implementation planners, they're talking down 
the data services section. housing section and

16:09.230 --> 16:24.430
economic

16:09.230 --> 16:24.430
section. Housing

16:24.450 --> 16:35.264
and

16:24.450 --> 16:35.264
economic section and then they have the jobs 
section. The jobs section has three people and

16:35.284 --> 16:39.169
they're involved with developing programs in 
terms of the federal funds that are used for jobs

16:35.284 --> 16:39.169
and they're working on programs in that aspect of 
it. The other section is more involved with

16:39.655 --> 16:59.705
housing

16:39.655 --> 16:59.705
and redevelopment, economic redevelopment of 
areas. They have approximately, let's see, they

16:59.725 --> 17:02.850
have six people working for them. Of course, data 
services, they have about six people working for

17:02.870 --> 17:04.272
them. And basically, data services involve 
crunching numbers. OK. What relation, going back

17:07.330 --> 17:24.527
to question number 10, I don't think we've hit upon 
your relationship to the legislative body, if

17:07.330 --> 17:24.527
any, and also to citizens groups besides at the 
planning

17:07.330 --> 17:24.527
commission meetings. Our relationship with the 
legislative body is really, in terms of

17:25.769 --> 17:32.055
technical, We are at their meetings, and if 
there's any questions in terms of some of the

17:32.204 --> 17:42.850
reports that we have put together, we answer them. 
They really deal directly with the city manager,

17:42.871 --> 17:44.695
the city council. In terms of citizen groups, like 
I said before, we set up this sector planning

17:45.113 --> 17:50.741
process. We do have different committees in these 
sectors. Our responsibility is to meet with them

17:57.451 --> 18:03.560
on a monthly basis, ones that are active. Not all of 
them are active. And we go out there and show them

18:06.044 --> 18:11.492
what zoning cases are coming about, what plans are 
happening, to keep them up to date with what's

18:06.044 --> 18:11.492
going on. to make them aware of what the situation

18:11.472 --> 18:25.638
is in terms of the market. And also if there's 
special studies to be done or there's a request for

18:25.658 --> 18:33.192
special studies, and again it comes back to our 
director from these citizen groups, and then we go

18:25.658 --> 18:33.192
ahead and either do the study or whatever the end of 
it is. That's really the basic relationship.

18:33.933 --> 18:41.764
They're basically a group that we work with as the 
committees, sector committees, sector

18:33.933 --> 18:41.764
councils. So, in effect, they're almost like 
miniature planning and zoning commissions, not

18:41.784 --> 18:49.215
having the... They don't have the authority. We 
don't try to make them to have the authority. It's

18:53.421 --> 18:57.066
more in terms of infiling them what's going on. And 
there's many times that we're on a different side

18:57.186 --> 19:01.392
of the fence than they are. There's a number of 
times that we're on the same side of the fence as the

19:01.726 --> 19:05.711
developer. Because they have their local 
interests and you try to incorporate the city's

19:05.731 --> 19:10.557
interests. Right. And we looked at it from a 
planner standpoint which generally in some cases

19:11.938 --> 19:25.855
is different than a lot of the citizens because 
really I think if the citizens had their right

19:11.938 --> 19:25.855
they'd want everything to be single family. They 
wouldn't want change but I mean, that's what

19:28.608 --> 19:33.774
planning's all about in development, is change. 
Okay, there was a city fair or exposition that you

19:33.794 --> 19:39.741
mentioned. The city fair, I think, was in the early 
30s. It was promoted by Anglin Carter, which is a

19:45.568 --> 19:58.463
well-known individual of the community that had 
plenty of money and helped to initiate a lot of This

19:58.814 --> 20:11.085
city fair took place generally in what is now 
called the Will Rogers Coliseum area, which

19:58.814 --> 20:11.085
includes a number of museums such as the Amon 
Carter Museum, the Fort Worth Art Museum, the

20:11.470 --> 20:27.233
Kimball Art Museum. Also Casa Manana is located in 
that area. So it really sort of was the basis and

20:28.094 --> 20:36.747
stimulated that particular area in terms of

20:28.094 --> 20:36.747
arts and culture. Okay. How did the development of 
the city charter play a role in the planning

20:38.808 --> 21:04.900
history and or any of the changes some of the 
changes uh city of fort worth basically have a

20:38.808 --> 21:04.900
cumulative type ordinance where generally if you 
have a zone a heavier zone such as commercial or

20:38.808 --> 21:04.900
industrial you can accumulate all the other zones 
in it such as I could put a single-family in a

21:05.200 --> 21:15.878
commercial area, or I could put a multi-family in a 
commercial area, or I could put a commercial area

21:05.200 --> 21:15.878
in an industrial area. And what we went through 
about two years ago was the review of the city

21:15.898 --> 21:31.343
ordinance to try to make certain 
recommendations, again, to the zoning

21:15.898 --> 21:31.343
commission, which in turn made it their 
recommendations

21:31.677 --> 21:42.356
to city council

21:31.677 --> 21:42.356
in terms of changes. And the thing that we were 
trying to get away from was to eliminate the

21:42.376 --> 21:53.836
accumulative aspects of our zoning ordinance. It 
did pass, but only in terms of a moratorium until

21:53.856 --> 21:56.841
1987. It'll happen then. In other words, if he had 
property right now, up until 1987, he just took and

21:59.295 --> 22:05.624
did all these things to it. But after 1987, then it 
doesn't matter what your property is. Once it's

22:09.470 --> 22:13.015
zoned, that's the way it's going to be. Was there 
any particular reason why 87 was chosen? No. It's a

22:17.162 --> 22:18.704
political reason. I mean, it was just a compromise 
for what the zoning task force

22:23.551 --> 22:45.795
wanted was which was the group body again we had 
people from different departments city

22:23.551 --> 22:45.795
departments on there and also had some private 
citizens on there what we wanted to do was to really

22:23.551 --> 22:45.795
not just go ahead and do it right away but through 
the political process and the pressures from the

22:46.771 --> 22:58.986
development industry, they got it

22:46.771 --> 22:58.986
to get it to extend

22:46.771 --> 22:58.986
that, so. Okay. That basically was the reason for 
that. All right. And I am the current staff. Okay,

23:04.672 --> 23:10.940
Mr. Mountsvice, what has been the role of outside 
consultants in the city planning in Fort Worth?

23:11.721 --> 23:14.584
Okay, since I've been here in the last three years, 
we've done the A downtown plan by a consultant was

23:14.969 --> 23:22.100
costing $128,000. This was done at Johnson 
Johnson in Roy. Previously, most of our downtown

23:24.884 --> 23:33.838
plans were done by outside consultants in the 
early 70s. I would

23:34.122 --> 23:59.910
say in terms of the downtown, the outside

23:34.122 --> 23:59.910
consultants have had a major influence

23:34.122 --> 23:59.910
on the development of the community and the growth 
of the downtown area. is what is the current status

24:01.055 --> 24:04.160
of planning in your city? We are in the process. We 
just completed what we call the sector planning to

24:09.088 --> 24:13.675
update our comprehensive plan. But we're also 
extending to what we call our district areas,

24:13.695 --> 24:18.422
which is more of the of the

24:18.807 --> 24:40.929
community,

24:18.807 --> 24:40.929
and it's the area that includes the ETJ,

24:18.807 --> 24:40.929
the Charitable Jurisdiction, and City Limits, 
one and the same. I mean, not one and the same, but it

24:40.949 --> 24:42.450
includes both those areas. And it's more of the 
areas that are newly developing. And what we're

24:43.731 --> 24:45.453
trying to do is, again, develop a comprehensive 
plan of the area. So we can combine that with the

24:45.473 --> 24:47.515
second plan and have an overall comprehensive 
plan for the community. We're

24:47.883 --> 25:12.081
doing that a

24:47.883 --> 25:12.081
little differently, but we're looking at each 
particular

24:47.883 --> 25:12.081
area and trying to come up with more or less highest 
and best use, but also have category

24:47.883 --> 25:12.081
of uses for a particular area, rather than saying 
that it should be only used for one particular

24:47.883 --> 25:12.081
purpose. We're in the process of doing all that 
now. And you've mentioned some political

25:12.942 --> 25:19.236
influences affecting planning in the community. 
Can you categorize that? Well, I say politically

25:23.165 --> 25:29.179
from a standpoint that generally, The comments 
that are

25:29.159 --> 25:55.690
made by our staff in terms of zoning requests and 
changes are not adhered to that closely, and I

25:29.159 --> 25:55.690
would think generally

25:29.159 --> 25:55.690
politically, the reason is the political 
influence that is happening to the city council

25:29.159 --> 25:55.690
and also probably to the zoning commission. In 
fact, the zoning commission here about a year ago

25:58.150 --> 26:06.978
much more pro the government.

26:08.219 --> 26:09.360
They pretty well rubber-stamped everything. But 
here lately, with new changes to the board, it has

26:09.380 --> 26:13.403
improved. So we're seeing much more, how shall I 
say, they're relating more to what we're talking

26:13.423 --> 26:19.008
about in our staff comments. So I think it's 
better. I think it's for the better. And also, what

26:26.034 --> 26:27.195
has changed in this area, is going

26:28.593 --> 26:44.070
from an overall city voting for the politicians to 
districts. We've broken up the districts.

26:50.597 --> 26:52.239
We have eight districts. And the mayor is at large, 
so it sort of gives a little

26:55.525 --> 27:13.926
more individual

26:55.525 --> 27:13.926
pressure for each of these districts so they all 
have

26:55.525 --> 27:13.926
their counseling. Basically the ethnic 
breakdown is two blacks, one Mexican-American,

27:13.946 --> 27:16.669
and the other is a... Caucasian. Caucasian, 
right. They're all Caucasians, but you hate to say

27:17.049 --> 27:18.411
black. But they're not . OK. Generally,

27:21.372 --> 27:28.320
that's really the right kind of thing. OK. Have 
those, what did you just call it, those districts,

27:28.340 --> 27:38.412
are they established on the same boundaries as the 
sectors for your planning? OK. The only reason

27:39.153 --> 27:45.040
that the boundaries of the sectors are generally 
made up from the same kind of . neighborhood,

27:45.020 --> 28:01.805
census tracts areas, major elements that would 
make a major barrier.

28:01.825 --> 28:04.749
It was more for a planning purpose than anything 
else. Well, we've touched upon the ethnic

28:04.769 --> 28:07.974
influences. Can you expand upon those influences 
on planning in the community? The only thing I can,

28:13.572 --> 28:17.490
let's see.

28:27.241 --> 28:39.283
Such as possibly the influx of, or the immigration 
of Mexicans or Asians in the early years. Well, of

28:39.563 --> 28:48.760
course, yeah, we see a lot of that, but again, these 
are really more in the, what we call the port areas

28:39.563 --> 28:48.760
of the community, and generally it's just... It 
hasn't been a major problem or anything, but you

28:49.398 --> 29:07.264
can see and there's a lot of feedback from the 
community that there's a difference going on. You

29:07.284 --> 29:10.208
can see the changing time in the area in terms of the 
influx of this group, different ethnic groups.

29:11.403 --> 29:18.751
But generally

29:11.403 --> 29:18.751
that's about it. There hasn't been any major 
influence by them to develop a particular history

29:18.771 --> 29:22.875
or anything of this nature at this time. So when 
people think of Fort Worth, they don't think of

29:22.895 --> 29:30.984
maybe like a little Italy or Chinatown or 
something like that? It's mostly... The only

29:32.005 --> 29:36.330
thing I can think of over the north side would be the 
Mexican-American side. And what we

29:38.285 --> 29:52.207
call the southeast area, which is the black area of 
the community, but that's generally it. Other

29:52.227 --> 29:54.090
than that, these new groups haven't had any 
influence at all as of yet. They probably will. And

29:55.902 --> 30:04.015
the only influence on planning would be the 
subsequent, maybe a different economic status in

29:55.902 --> 30:04.015
those areas or something? Right. Okay, not 
because of their beliefs or... Right, right.

30:09.924 --> 30:10.164
Okay. How about the military influence, 
especially like with Carswell Air Force Base?

30:14.491 --> 30:20.560
That's one of the major industries, Carswell, and 
also GD, General Dynamics, and they're one of the

30:14.491 --> 30:20.560
largest... In part in the community

30:21.198 --> 30:41.742
and of course Bell Helicopter, which is, as it 
plans, it's not in

30:21.198 --> 30:41.742
for work, but it's in heavy influence also. The 
military has had, I would say, in terms of

30:41.762 --> 30:44.025
development of the community, growth of the 
community. There's been a problem with the

30:44.165 --> 30:50.192
Carswell Air Force Base, that is, with growth and 
the noise from the jet planes and so forth

30:50.712 --> 31:09.411
that's causing

30:50.712 --> 31:09.411
problems. It really has influenced our plan for 
that area in that we feel a lot of the areas that are

31:09.431 --> 31:15.437
hard of crest and are adjacent to the base, we 
generally see more of a, hopefully an industrial

31:09.431 --> 31:15.437
type use because of the noise factor and the 
residential use. That's the plan. OK. How about on

31:20.265 --> 31:26.151
the influence of the loop with 280? Has that 
controlled growth at all? Yeah. And what we are

31:34.058 --> 31:46.150
seeing is that in terms of zoning requests, major 
influences around the major intersections of

31:34.058 --> 31:46.150
what we call the loop and also the east, west, 
north, south, freeway system uh where these

31:47.260 --> 32:16.710
things converge is generally where we see a higher 
development intensity a lot of what we call g zones

31:47.260 --> 32:16.710
which is really high rise type development we see 
in those areas so what it's going to do which is good

31:47.260 --> 32:16.710
it's going to develop loads around those major 
intersections which over a period of time could

31:47.260 --> 32:16.710
become if the density of the community was to 
increase later years could be uh Transportation,

32:18.732 --> 32:25.101
though, could be linked to each of those little 
nodes to the downtown area. OK, how about with

32:26.503 --> 32:34.075
Texas Christian University? Has that made any 
impact on the planning for the city? No, it hasn't.

32:40.745 --> 32:44.470
We've worked pretty well with TCU, and they've 
expanded their university somewhat, and they do

32:44.888 --> 32:47.391
have to pay. There is some problem there with the 
residential area, but we are working with the

32:47.411 --> 33:07.594
city, the citizens, and also with

32:47.411 --> 33:07.594
TCE to try to develop some kind of a system where 
they would have a master plan, and they wouldn't

32:47.411 --> 33:07.594
influence the area too much. But that influence is 
there. You can see that some problems wouldn't

33:08.195 --> 33:09.276
work. OK. The one that I wanted to bring up The Texas 
West London Colleges, which is just part of some

33:12.175 --> 33:21.277
land out now, ETJ, it has been annexed. They have a 
complete new campus in the area. And the old campus

33:23.836 --> 33:39.961
is basically in an older part of the community 
called the Polytechnic area, which is a mixture of

33:23.836 --> 33:39.961
blacks and whites. Now, that was the area that was 
generally white, but back in the 50s, you know,

33:39.981 --> 33:45.689
what they called a pipe fight. People were moving 
out of the center city. That was one of the areas

33:46.571 --> 33:48.814
that was really hidden, and a lot of people moved 
out of that area. And so

33:48.794 --> 34:03.989
some of the blacks moved

33:48.794 --> 34:03.989
into there. So now you have a black and white 
mixture, which there's no problem. The problem is

34:07.173 --> 34:12.198
that with the new campus for TWC, the dilemma is 
what to do with the old campus. And there have been

34:12.338 --> 34:18.244
some discussions in the papers about the Stephen 
F. Austin College having up here developing

34:12.338 --> 34:18.244
courses

34:19.979 --> 34:31.864
to have what they call a window to the Metroplex, 
which will be good because it will hopefully keep

34:19.979 --> 34:31.864
the area a little more viable. But that campus does 
influence that area, but not to a major extent. You

34:35.752 --> 34:36.253
know what I'm saying? A little in terms of 
commercial use, but other than that, it really

34:36.273 --> 34:38.578
doesn't. All right. Speaking of other inner city 
influences, how about the affluent area around

34:41.101 --> 34:51.414
colonial country club and all? Does that have a 
major effect on your planning at all? How did that

34:54.978 --> 34:58.783
area begin? I can tell you generally how. Well, I 
would say the way it began. I'm just speculating,

35:03.889 --> 35:07.654
but I'm saying just the areas that people

35:07.955 --> 35:17.467
would allow money to develop the area, and that's 
just the hard way it could be. The other thing is,

35:19.379 --> 35:30.175
There was, at one time, the west of the downtown 
called the Arlington Heights area. At one time,

35:30.195 --> 35:39.790
it's called, it has a major street down there, it's 
called Camp Bowie Boulevard, which is very,

35:30.195 --> 35:39.790
historically very significant. Actually, that 
area was where supposedly It was called Camp Bull

35:41.300 --> 35:49.216
because that's where the camp was for

35:41.300 --> 35:49.216
the military back in the early days. But the thing 
is that is one of the areas that has really came up in

35:49.236 --> 35:58.735
terms of cost of property and maybe so we started to 
in place to be because it has access to the cultural

35:59.120 --> 36:14.585
district, it has good access to the major park 
system that we have, it has access to the river, you

35:59.120 --> 36:14.585
know. So it has all these inputs on it and it really 
has had a major impact in

36:18.830 --> 36:29.159
terms of the cost of the presidential unit down 
there. But that's generally the only area. OK. How

36:29.900 --> 36:35.985
have you considered the Trinity River in your 
planning? Have there been any problems as far as

36:36.005 --> 36:39.789
flooding? No. They have a levee. It's controlled 
by our local water control

36:41.550 --> 36:48.837
board. It is used

36:48.817 --> 37:09.145
quite extensively by people who have biking 
trails along it and also have hiking trails. It's

37:09.165 --> 37:10.267
used quite a bit for jogging and so forth. It's 
really become a major element of the community and

37:10.287 --> 37:13.812
it's been utilized. How about the influence of 
Dallas-Fort Worth Airport? Has there been much of

37:17.673 --> 37:24.060
an impact on Fort Worth? Yeah, I think generally 
the impact has been in terms of

37:24.080 --> 37:38.236
the people in the downtown hoping for future 
development. There's been a major office

37:38.256 --> 37:39.378
development in the downtown. I can't remember off 
the top of my head, I can't say how many square feet,

37:39.398 --> 37:45.925
but it's double the square footage that was here 
before 19... So

37:46.276 --> 38:09.178
I

37:46.276 --> 38:09.178
think

37:46.276 --> 38:09.178
everybody's hoping or banking

37:46.276 --> 38:09.178
on the idea of the influence of the Dallas-Fort 
Worth airport that we'll have in the downtown in

37:46.276 --> 38:09.178
terms of the financial maintenance and audits 
area. The problem with the city of Fort Worth is

38:10.559 --> 38:19.651
that we really don't have like a northeast section 
of the community. That's different. That begins

38:20.793 --> 38:24.237
to be made up of different cities. We have one 
that's adjacent to Fort Worth, it's Hawthorne

38:24.257 --> 38:33.850
City, and then we have North Richland Hills, and 
then you have Bedford, Collierville, and then you

38:24.257 --> 38:33.850
have Euless, and then you have the airport. Those, 
I would say if anybody has benefited, those

38:34.117 --> 38:43.508
communities between Fort Worth and the airport 
probably benefited more than we have. But, you

38:43.528 --> 38:52.779
know, we would have, had we had this quadrant in 
here, I think it would have been a major influence.

38:52.799 --> 38:55.782
Okay, where do you foresee growth in Fort Worth 
right now? Well, right now, we see a heck of a lot of

38:55.802 --> 38:57.604
growth. Actually, north, what we call them, 
Northeast area, or what we call Summerfield area

39:01.336 --> 39:09.347
up here, part of Little Bay 20 and east of I-35. 
There's a major development down here.

39:18.480 --> 39:21.464
Okay, and so the growth is mainly to the north? 
Okay, the other growth is in the southwest area,

39:21.524 --> 39:26.331
which is east of, I mean west of Little Bay. of I-35 
and south of Loop 820. Generally, that's been the

39:32.021 --> 39:34.526
growth. There's quite a number of proposals and 
zoning changes to the east, but one of the big

39:34.846 --> 39:49.652
influences here is going to be what we call the Fort 
Worth-Dallas Turnpike, which is I-30 going to

39:34.846 --> 39:49.652
Dallas. getting access on two areas where there 
wasn't access previously. So what that has caused

39:56.223 --> 40:08.117
is major changes in terms of zoning requests along 
that corridor going to Dow, so I wouldn't see a

39:56.223 --> 40:08.117
major development in that area in the future. So 
the three areas would be what we call south of the

40:08.137 --> 40:12.282
Wedgwood, and the Summerfields area, and what we 
call the Bentley Village area. Okay, what would

40:17.562 --> 40:26.837
you say would be the reasons for the growth in the 
south of Wedgwood and the Ridgefield area? The

40:26.857 --> 40:30.202
Wedgwood area, that's weird. I can't understand. 
There's no job market down there. The only job

40:37.314 --> 40:40.699
market is... There's a Carswell Air Force Base up 
here, but hell, it's a hell of a way to get up there.

40:48.394 --> 40:51.684
But I just think it's just the area that people 
wanted to be down there. I can't understand. The

40:52.827 --> 40:53.449
open space. There is an industrial development 
out along I-35, but there's nothing. There's not

40:57.115 --> 41:07.367
that much to house all those people, so I don't 
really tell you where those people are going or

40:57.115 --> 41:07.367
where they're working. In fact, it's really more 
of a problem because, again, we did our study on

41:07.467 --> 41:19.562
Southwest Freeway, and if anything, the road 
conditions are going to get worse before they ever

41:07.467 --> 41:19.562
get better. If we ever see that Southwest Freeway 
coming along, we'll probably talk to anybody from

41:20.656 --> 41:26.643
seven to ten years from now. And by that time, man, 
you're going to have real traffic problems there.

41:30.967 --> 41:33.190
So I don't understand why would people want to go 
down there and live. Now the other area, which is

41:33.210 --> 41:44.402
the Summerfields area, is a good area because you 
have good access to the freeway system. Just

41:45.209 --> 41:57.686
driving time, I'm not saying getting out of your 
car and parking and walking to where you want to go,

41:45.209 --> 41:57.686
but driving time to downtown Fort Worth is, you 
know, 15 minutes, 20 minutes. Maybe to Dallas

41:57.706 --> 42:10.464
downtown, and I'm saying just on a general day, I'm 
not saying during morning traffic, is no more than

41:57.706 --> 42:10.464
40 minutes. So convenience has caused that. I 
think in course of development of the the

42:15.449 --> 42:16.911
Dallas-Fort Worth Airport. Also, there's Las 
Colinas, which is located adjacent to

42:17.051 --> 42:22.038
Dallas-Fort Worth. It's going to be a big market 
for employment. So that has spurred a lot of

42:23.940 --> 42:26.183
development over here. That's why I can't see this 
development in Wedgwood. I don't understand it. I

42:29.227 --> 42:31.430
just don't understand how people want to move 
there. If anything, it should either be all over

42:31.450 --> 42:38.198
here or even in the Meadowbrook area. Now, the 
Meadowbrook area is changing, but it's not

42:38.218 --> 42:42.444
happening as fast as the other areas. We are having 
a lot of important development moments. what we

42:45.166 --> 42:56.123
call East Chase Parkway, which has just gotten 
access to I-30, and then we're going to have

42:45.166 --> 42:56.123
another one about a mile away, which would be 
Cook's Lane. So those are two good access points.

42:58.566 --> 43:05.036
And there are going to be some major changes in 
those areas in terms of the connection between

42:58.566 --> 43:05.036
Loop A-20 and I-30. So now you can't get from I-30 to 
Loop A-20 without... coming off the freeway and

43:11.373 --> 43:15.878
going on the French Road and then coming back and 
then coming home. So it's a real hassle. Do you

43:17.519 --> 43:19.661
foresee a continuation of the loop? Yeah. Down to 
about this, you're talking about? Yes. All the way

43:24.586 --> 43:27.069
down to 35. This is tied back like this. You mean the 
southwest freeway you're talking about? Yes.

43:37.019 --> 43:38.741
Where are they pointing at? Right there. Oh, OK. 
No, it'll just come back this way. It'll come back

43:44.737 --> 43:45.879
this way. So you get a complete loop here. All 
right. One other big influence. In reference to

43:51.749 --> 44:00.364
transportation, there might be also another 
development going on in that we would probably

43:51.749 --> 44:00.364
like to do, and we're going to look at this in our 
district planning, try to tie in with the loop off

44:00.344 --> 44:18.820
of, now this would be a long range plan, but loop 635 
here that ties in with our loop 820, we might want to

44:00.344 --> 44:18.820
try to tie in with that loop, which is called North 
Dallas, where you have all the gallery and all the

44:00.344 --> 44:18.820
traffic problems. What's happening is if we tie in 
with this 635, we could bring that over and tie back

44:18.840 --> 44:25.867
in to our loop 820. So in essence, you could have 
access, you know, to the north side of

44:29.977 --> 44:39.270
Dallas-Wilworth plus also the north side of, I 
mean, Dallas-Wilworth Airport plus the north

44:29.977 --> 44:39.270
side of Dallas. Who would be responsible for 
forming a plan like that? We would be. The North

44:43.296 --> 44:45.639
Texas Council of Governments? We would be working 
with them. We'd develop a plan for our ETJ area.

44:49.344 --> 44:57.756
We'd try to work with all these other different 
municipalities and try to develop a corridor to

44:49.344 --> 44:57.756
these so we could hopefully implement that plan 
for the future. So there is no area-wide

45:02.665 --> 45:15.154
planning agency that would consider all of these 
regional aspects? All right. What has been Fort

45:16.248 --> 45:22.133
Worth's relationship, since you've been here, 
with the city of Dallas? Traditionally, there's

45:22.293 --> 45:24.075
been a rivalry. Is that still existent? No. In 
fact, we just got Clark Grant, or in the process of

45:26.778 --> 45:35.386
getting Grant, to develop the railroad. There's a 
railroad going from downtown Fort Worth to

45:35.406 --> 45:39.870
Dallas. I'm trying to remember what the name was. 
You can talk to my transportation plan.

45:48.749 --> 46:05.950
Or

45:48.749 --> 46:05.950
the railroad, so we'd have access from downtown 
Fort Worth to downtown Dallas. Via railroad.

46:09.134 --> 46:10.376
Via railroad, and that, I'm trying to think of the 
name of it. I don't know. So that's just a plan on...

46:12.256 --> 46:17.302
Well, no, it's going to, it'll happen. I mean, 
initially we're buying up the railroad. I mean,

46:19.324 --> 46:21.306
just buying up the right-of-way. Will that be a 
railroad for transportation of the public? Yeah,

46:27.113 --> 46:28.455
a commuter. Oh, a commuter, okay. A commuter

46:30.016 --> 46:39.547
from Dallas. I don't think that round comes. So 
Dallas and Fort Worth are definitely working

46:41.146 --> 46:48.321
together these days.
