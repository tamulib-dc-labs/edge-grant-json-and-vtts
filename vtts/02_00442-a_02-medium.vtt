00:02.225 --> 00:05.329
Let's get back to your father and if he did or didn't 
have high school. I don't believe he did. I believe

00:07.092 --> 00:15.044
that he's, I believe he dropped out of high school 
in the eighth grade or something like that and

00:07.092 --> 00:15.044
started working. My mother finished high school 
and her younger sister was a school teacher. Her

00:24.117 --> 00:26.520
first cousin was a school teacher. So they were, 
and my mother attended Baylor University for one

00:32.397 --> 00:34.079
year, I think. So the fascination with education 
was a little more on my mother's side from an

00:36.122 --> 00:57.612
experience standpoint than my father's, but my 
father did respect it greatly and I guess was

00:36.122 --> 00:57.612
insistent that his children go as far as they could 
because he was denied the opportunity.

01:01.507 --> 01:03.009
Why was he denied the opportunity? Because the 
family was poor and he had to go to work? I believe

01:05.671 --> 01:16.883
that's right and of course in those days it wasn't 
considered to be very essential to finish high

01:05.671 --> 01:16.883
school either. True. He was a highly intelligent 
person. He could earn money with his bookkeeping

01:21.468 --> 01:31.058
skills

01:21.468 --> 01:31.058
and he just pretty well could teach himself or 
learn by experience.

01:42.047 --> 01:47.215
Now did the military aspect of A&M have anything to 
do with your decision to come here? No.

01:51.742 --> 01:53.144
It didn't. And you were influenced by the 
agricultural aspect, in other words then You, who

01:59.725 --> 02:05.191
became a general, never thought of a military 
career in high school? No. Never thought about

02:06.433 --> 02:09.777
going to service school like West Point or 
anything like that? No. Okay. Not at all. Okay. You

02:13.822 --> 02:14.823
arrived in 1935? Yes, fall of 1935. Oh, your first 
impressions when you got off that train? Did you

02:21.751 --> 02:22.872
come by the train? I did, yes. My brother and I made 
our first trips together. by a train coming to

02:29.864 --> 02:32.686
Texas A&M. I was mighty awestruck. Texas A&M had 
quite a reputation for hazing freshmen at the

02:37.331 --> 02:43.036
time. I was apprehensive

02:43.056 --> 02:56.668
and that was a proper attitude because it was a 
little traumatic. Can you describe some of the

02:56.688 --> 02:58.369
hazing? In the first place, I guess it's a little 
unusual that my brother and I didn't attempt to

03:01.049 --> 03:08.998
live together. He was acquainted with somebody 
that influenced him to get into the infantry here.

03:23.315 --> 03:27.900
I was influenced by a person from, a couple of 
people from from Orange County who were in the

03:29.264 --> 03:38.756
artillery and consequently my brother and I never 
lived together here. I got over into the F Battery

03:39.157 --> 03:52.974
Field Artillery where there were two Orange 
County people in leadership positions that I

03:39.157 --> 03:52.974
replaced from the name of I.B. Murray and a person 
named Nelson who was first sergeant of the

03:58.272 --> 04:06.322
artillery battery that I joined.

04:10.488 --> 04:21.141
We were of course strongly disciplined as 
freshmen

04:10.488 --> 04:21.141
and really Looked after day and night primarily by 
the sophomores. We were of course room artillers

04:26.465 --> 04:33.273
for upperclassmen.

04:33.293 --> 04:37.338
So Abraham Lincoln didn't free all the slaves. We 
did a little slave labor as freshmen at Texas A&M.

04:40.362 --> 04:42.264
What kind of work? Shining shoes? Well we shined 
boots and we swept rooms, made beds.

04:52.525 --> 04:57.474
that sort of orderly type activities as freshmen. 
Tell me about the hazing.

05:03.804 --> 05:15.765
Well,

05:03.804 --> 05:15.765
if you didn't follow the rules according to 
somebody's desires, they did sometimes use a

05:03.804 --> 05:15.765
board on you. Of course, there were strong 
traditions about that, about what stance you'd

05:18.361 --> 05:24.771
take and how you'd take that. It was ironical that 
then, you know, when somebody gave you a licking

05:27.114 --> 05:41.396
with the board, you were obliged to congratulate 
him for his skill at applying to the board. It

05:41.416 --> 05:42.477
didn't hurt anything. It's, of course, an 
experience that one remembers always. I can't

05:48.584 --> 06:07.854
advocate that at all, but still there's no 
question in my mind that going through again some

05:48.584 --> 06:07.854
sacrifices here made you appreciate a whole lot 
more earning a degree under those circumstances

05:48.584 --> 06:07.854
in Texas A&M. So you thought the hazing and the 
traditions then were beneficial? Oh certainly, I

06:11.439 --> 06:13.763
sure did. Were you sorry to see the hazing from the 
university? No, not really. I think that that was a

06:22.146 --> 06:26.950
sign of the times. In those days,

06:26.970 --> 06:46.148
it probably was beneficial, but I expect that

06:26.970 --> 06:46.148
the expectations of people changed along the way. 
I don't regret at all that we have virtually

06:46.415 --> 06:56.625
eliminated hazing, as far as I know absolutely 
eliminated that type of hazing from Texas A&M.

06:58.606 --> 07:03.131
That was a change that was necessary, desirable. 
Can you describe your accommodations?

07:09.537 --> 07:15.342
Well,

07:09.537 --> 07:15.342
I was quartered in Goodwin Hall.

07:19.220 --> 07:20.501
in my freshman year.

07:23.904 --> 07:33.272
The room was, of course, very Spartan type, wooden 
floors, not very good, bunk beds.

07:35.995 --> 07:48.906
The enrollment at Texas A&M had just begun to 
increase beyond dormitory capacity, so there

07:35.995 --> 07:48.906
were, not my freshman year, the following years, 
there were three in a room. We did stack the bunk

07:49.831 --> 07:51.734
beds. Of course, a basin in the room, but the toilet 
facilities were just one floor.

08:06.501 --> 08:10.448
We marched the meals, every meal. Of course, the 
freshmen were obliged to We'd get up at Reveille

08:13.962 --> 08:24.658
and assemble together out on the steps of the 
dormitory and sing the artillery song after the

08:13.962 --> 08:24.658
bugle blew. A real live bugler.

08:33.431 --> 08:39.700
It was distinctly an advantage that everybody 
wore the uniform because of course My brother and I

08:41.148 --> 08:52.104
didn't have any money, but we looked like 
everybody else on campus and there were a whole

08:41.148 --> 08:52.104
bunch of them like that too. My brother and I did 
attempt to find student employment.

09:01.010 --> 09:09.740
But there were some 4,000 students on campus our 
freshman year, and only about 3,000 of them were

09:01.010 --> 09:09.740
working student jobs. Oh, really? Really? Very 
minimum wages, $0.25, $0.30 an hour. And we just

09:17.889 --> 09:30.983
couldn't, though we'd made a special trip up here 
six months before we enrolled or so, but we were not

09:17.889 --> 09:30.983
able to obtain student employment our freshman 
year. Did you eventually become employed? Yes, a

09:35.428 --> 09:37.791
sophomore year. Both my brother and I were members 
of the janitor force.

09:46.961 --> 09:54.490
The hardest jobs on the janitor force were 
sweeping dormitories, so we spent the first year

09:46.961 --> 09:54.490
doing that.

09:56.933 --> 10:02.900
And then my junior year, I was a janitor in the very 
building we're sitting in right now. When I was

10:05.263 --> 10:10.790
reassigned here a couple of years ago, I told them I 
wasn't so awestruck I'd been assigned to this

10:05.263 --> 10:10.790
building before.

10:14.094 --> 10:15.235
I knew the building well. Then as a senior, I was a 
janitor foreman of student janitors for this

10:15.515 --> 10:25.928
building, Animal Industries Ag Building and 
Pavilion.

10:29.097 --> 10:44.814
I spent freshman year in Goodwin Hall and then the 
sophomore year was spent

10:29.097 --> 10:44.814
in Law Hall.

10:44.834 --> 10:47.337
It still is functional dormitory. Then the last 
two years I was in Miller Hall, which recently of

10:48.398 --> 10:59.070
course had been remodeled and recommitted to 
offices and classrooms.

11:02.257 --> 11:29.125
My brother and I were afforded the opportunity to 
come to college by a relative of my mother's

11:02.257 --> 11:29.125
who was a school teacher in Beaumont and she came 
from Smith County also and she was an unmarried

11:02.257 --> 11:29.125
school teacher when oil was discovered in East 
Texas in the early 30s and she obtained some wealth

11:31.062 --> 11:47.761
from that and she loaned money to my brother and me 
to come to college. We borrowed all of the money it

11:47.881 --> 11:57.913
took that we didn't earn as student workers to come 
to college. I was more thrifty than my brother, and

11:59.699 --> 12:13.074
when we graduated, I owed Miss Leila Jarvis 
$1,220, and he owed her a little over $1,400.

12:13.314 --> 12:14.696
That's what it said. The total amount it took for us 
to go to school for four years, other than what we

12:15.557 --> 12:25.889
earned as student workers. Well, what kind of 
social life did you have then? And we had a great

12:29.635 --> 12:35.385
social life, to the extent you can with all men. And 
of course on the ladies it was a very special

12:36.066 --> 12:42.798
occasion.

12:45.262 --> 12:50.011
There were dances on campus in relation to 
football games and that sort of thing. The

12:50.972 --> 12:54.158
strangest thing to me is there probably weren't 
Two dozen automobiles owned by students on the

12:54.475 --> 12:59.549
whole campus in most cases. These were secondhand 
cars that several people had gone in together to

12:59.689 --> 13:10.459
buy when they went to ROTC camp between their 
junior and senior years. And of course

13:12.650 --> 13:15.293
hitchhiking was all the thing in those days. We had 
to travel by catch and ride, so usually my brother

13:15.894 --> 13:33.033
and I would, if we had an opportunity to go home on 
the weekend, we would hitchhike or maybe even ride

13:15.894 --> 13:33.033
the bus to Houston for three or four dollars and 
hitchhike from there to Orange.

13:36.777 --> 13:41.442
So there was a great tradition about hitchhiking 
around Texas A&M then. wearing your uniform.

13:47.070 --> 13:48.492
Hitchhiking was mighty easy.

13:52.597 --> 13:55.100
Texans had confidence in Texas Aggies. I'm sure 
many of them would pick up people in the Texas Aggie

13:55.861 --> 14:01.008
cadet uniform. Then hitchhiking wasn't against 
regulations? Oh no, it wasn't.

14:09.130 --> 14:11.912
and there were strong traditions associated with 
it. Sometimes on a weekend you'd go out to the east

14:12.353 --> 14:21.401
gate to the campus and you might be number 200 in 
line. You wouldn't dare upstream anybody or go

14:21.761 --> 14:27.966
further up to catch a ride. Strong conditions 
anywhere you went. There was the Aggie

14:30.448 --> 14:32.290
hitchhiking line. It'd be at a certain place and 
you took your turn in that line. No kidding. Sure,

14:36.634 --> 14:38.175
Houston or Beaumont or wherever there's a certain 
place you went to get your ads and when you got there

14:38.847 --> 14:52.339
you determined where you were in the land and you 
didn't dare move up or upstream anybody and that

14:38.847 --> 14:52.339
sort of thing. Well that was a fine thing. How

14:53.740 --> 15:00.406
was the food in the dormitories during the 
depression?

15:04.069 --> 15:08.533
Well I would say that it was abundant

15:10.589 --> 15:13.193
and better than most of us had at home. Of course 
there weren't complaints about food but this was

15:13.694 --> 15:35.331
family service and of course the freshmen were 
required to wait on the upperclassmen and give

15:13.694 --> 15:35.331
them first shot at everything but after the 
upperclassmen left the mess hall as we called it

15:13.694 --> 15:35.331
then The freshmen had all the food they wanted on 
their own table or on tables around there. Of

15:44.258 --> 15:56.170
course, it was one of the sacrifices that the 
freshmen had to make is that they were not allowed

15:44.258 --> 15:56.170
to eat desserts during their first year until 
right at the end of the year. Of course, the

15:57.571 --> 16:02.376
freshmen had nicknames for all the food. They 
called it kush. You weren't allowed to. eat any pie

16:06.513 --> 16:08.575
or dessert. The upperclassmen got all that they 
wanted, food in their share and that of the

16:09.136 --> 16:14.361
freshmen. So it was a great event right toward the 
end of your freshman year when you were, you had

16:16.003 --> 16:31.219
earned your spurs, so to speak, and were allowed to 
eat kush.

16:31.239 --> 16:36.064
I expect many freshmen did, but they had to do it 
kind of surreptitiously. What were some of the

16:36.432 --> 16:45.570
things that you liked about the Corps and some of 
the things that you disliked about the Corps?

16:49.999 --> 16:58.035
Well I liked very much the camaraderie

16:49.999 --> 16:58.035
of the Corps, being one of the guys.

17:01.458 --> 17:06.365
and passing the tests, whatever sacrifices you 
were required to make. There were 32 of us in my

17:06.405 --> 17:10.951
freshman class in my ROTC outfit.

17:16.659 --> 17:21.005
It is macho to be one of the tougher ones. You could 
take the hazing, you could take whatever

17:21.025 --> 17:29.457
requirements there were without knuckling 
under. So there's no question in my mind that that

17:31.411 --> 17:36.897
molded character quite a bit.

17:45.427 --> 17:51.694
Then the camaraderie of not only your classmates, 
but of your military organization.

17:57.200 --> 17:59.983
The F battery field artillery was something 
special.

18:03.203 --> 18:04.745
Anything you disliked about it? Anything that 
bothered you about it at the time? I really adapted

18:10.252 --> 18:15.699
real well to the military and corps life. I liked it 
first grade. You know back in the 1930s American

18:19.163 --> 18:25.231
foreign policy was isolationist basically. 
While the Japanese and the Germans were very

18:25.251 --> 18:29.937
aggressive We were sticking our head in the sand, 
and one might say that we were almost

18:31.064 --> 18:41.319
anti-militaristic in this country back in the 
mid-1930s when you were here at A&M. We only had an

18:41.339 --> 18:45.085
army of about 100,000 men. Did this mood ever 
appear here at A&M? No, absolutely not. We had some

18:52.796 --> 18:56.802
real outstanding ROTC instructors. It's amazing 
to me how many of those who were captains,

18:59.043 --> 19:17.889
majors, right after we got more involved and 
started expanding the military forces rose right

18:59.043 --> 19:17.889
on up to be general officers. We really had some 
mighty outstanding active army people here as

19:22.178 --> 19:27.024
ROTC instructors. Do you remember any that had an 
influence on your life and what was that

19:27.045 --> 19:32.432
influence? Oh sure. Who were these people? Well 
there was a Colonel O.E. Beasley who was chief of

19:37.358 --> 19:52.118
the artillery branch of ROTC and Captain Lloyd 
Garrison,

19:37.358 --> 19:52.118
a dapper bachelor type. There

19:54.089 --> 20:05.663
were a couple of other artillery instructors. 
Right now I'm having a little bit of trouble

20:05.864 --> 20:14.594
remembering their names, but all of these were 
outstanding active army type people. They were

20:14.815 --> 20:18.800
demanding, but fair people. I don't know. I'd say 
they had tremendous influence on my young life. I

20:28.149 --> 20:33.394
thought I'd really gotten somewhere when I got to 
be a senior. Colonel Beasley, who was quite a

20:34.515 --> 20:43.104
horseman himself, selected me to help him in 
teaching equitation. Of course, battery field

20:43.484 --> 20:47.648
artillery was a horse-drawn outfit. Of course, we 
had cavalry horses and artillery horses on

20:47.968 --> 20:51.872
campus. just west of the railroad, we had stables 
there. Of course I'd had quite a bit of previous

20:58.723 --> 21:03.028
experience with horses at home.

21:06.332 --> 21:18.265
So I thought it was something mighty special that 
Colonel Beasley would come by Milner Hall and pick

21:06.332 --> 21:18.265
me up and take me down and I could help him teach 
equitation to sophomore students in ROTC.

21:20.557 --> 21:23.040
It appears that you admired this man. Oh yes, I did.

21:27.065 --> 21:31.872
Garrison Lieutenant Benny P. Heiser, I remember. 
How would you spell that? He was a H-E-I-S-E-R.

21:37.699 --> 21:41.765
He was a great big sort of heavy set man.

21:44.648 --> 21:46.411
He was a little bit of a clown. Of course a West Point 
graduate. I remember his telling us in ROTC

21:50.898 --> 22:05.577
classes that when he was in the 12th Field 
Artillery of the 2nd Infantry Division of San

21:50.898 --> 22:05.577
Antonio, Dizzy Dean was a soldier. He was a catcher 
on the baseball team and Dizzy Dean was a pitcher.

22:10.824 --> 22:12.647
So he used to catch Dizzy Dean. And of course he was 
the first lieutenant and by then he'd probably

22:14.429 --> 22:20.517
been in the Army 10 or 12 years. Lloyd Garrison was a 
captain, and he'd probably been in the army 20

22:21.813 --> 22:29.500
years. And Colonel Beasley was a lieutenant 
colonel, and he'd probably been in the army 25

22:31.762 --> 22:39.789
years, so they sure didn't have very much rank. 
Vinny Heiser used to say to his ROTC classes as

22:40.169 --> 22:49.778
well, Everybody on campus ranks me except 
Lieutenant Moses and he's adjutant, he tells me

22:52.373 --> 23:02.684
what to do also.

23:09.552 --> 23:19.343
What did these men teach you besides military life 
or artillery, your profession?

23:24.520 --> 23:43.710
Well, I think they were demanding people and when 
we went out to drill,

23:24.520 --> 23:43.710
whatever,

23:24.520 --> 23:43.710
they set high standards and demanded compliance.

23:45.935 --> 23:53.343
No question that they had tremendous influence on 
my life, on the standards that I'd set. I'd do

23:54.064 --> 23:58.128
whatever I could to find favor with these people 
because I admired them a lot. But they were

24:00.491 --> 24:04.235
certainly an inspiration. And if you had to answer 
the question, in what ways do you think that the

24:04.255 --> 24:11.703
Corps helped or hindered your career, that would 
be part of it. Oh, certainly.

24:17.103 --> 24:35.125
There's no question that I had very fine 
experiences,

24:17.103 --> 24:35.125
received some recognition and inspiration from 
what I did in the Corps of Cadets at Texas A&M.

24:35.145 --> 24:38.188
You were a regimental commander in 1938, 1939. 
How'd you get that job, and can you explain your

24:38.509 --> 24:41.853
functions and duties?

24:44.696 --> 24:46.198
Well, I guess Through academic record and through 
accomplishments in ROTC, I was selected for the

24:46.702 --> 25:01.169
position of regimental commander.

25:01.189 --> 25:04.435
What accomplishments in ROTC? Well, the grades 
you made in military science. and performance at

25:11.002 --> 25:20.117
the ROTC camp between your junior and senior year 
selection weren't made until after that. There

25:22.400 --> 25:27.208
was a rotation of leadership in ROTC camp 
observation. The same instructors were there at

25:27.248 --> 25:31.355
ROTC camp. Texas Aggies were thrown in with cadets 
from other institutions too. So there was an

25:38.795 --> 25:52.756
opportunity to express

25:38.795 --> 25:52.756
leadership capabilities in the rotational 
duties in ROTC camp. What duties did you have as a

25:52.776 --> 25:57.262
commander? Well as commander of the artillery 
regiment, which was composed of three

25:57.282 --> 26:07.097
battalions, two that lived on campus And a day 
student battalion, I believe it amounted to some

26:08.005 --> 26:17.496
3,000 cadets, I think, you know, the artillery 
raid cadets. Really? You were in charge of 3,000

26:18.077 --> 26:20.260
cadets? Was a good deal larger than, I think it was 
about 2,000 cadets. Yeah, 2,000 cadets. So

26:29.871 --> 26:31.313
anyway... The military outfits, the ROTC 
companies and batteries were much larger than the

26:31.698 --> 26:41.632
ones today because ROTC was compulsory. 
Everybody had to take at least two years and even if

26:41.772 --> 26:55.191
students were not enrolled in advanced ROTC, they 
still lived in the military outfits, wore the

26:41.772 --> 26:55.191
uniform, marched to meals.

26:57.095 --> 27:02.962
their student life was all in ROTC units. So there 
were some 2,000 cadets in there, and our duties

27:05.305 --> 27:24.908
during regular student living were to establish 
contact with the staff, with the company, with the

27:05.305 --> 27:24.908
battery commanders and artillery.

27:27.925 --> 27:35.095
to command the unit during the two-hour drill 
periods each week. In most cases, the activities

27:35.115 --> 27:42.244
were by batteries or platoons. But in some cases, 
at ceremonies, for instance, reviews or

27:42.264 --> 27:52.077
whatever, we functioned as an entire regiment.

27:55.145 --> 28:02.972
And of course, every meal, the unit formed up and 
marched the meals. The staff fell in with the

28:03.653 --> 28:08.117
regimental commander. There was a battalion 
staff for each battalion, marched the meals every

28:08.838 --> 28:21.810
three times a day, except on weekends since we 
didn't do it then. Why were you picked as the

28:24.018 --> 28:26.501
regimental commander? Well I don't know 
entirely.

28:33.629 --> 28:51.088
At this time and every other time that I've gotten a 
promotion in my life I could always see there were a

28:33.629 --> 28:51.088
lot of people that appeared to be equally 
qualified and so you know I just don't know. the

28:52.165 --> 28:57.814
officers to select me over a bunch of apparently 
equally qualified people.

29:01.080 --> 29:02.682
But I was mighty proud to be selected. I bet you 
were. That's a great position for a man, what 20

29:05.246 --> 29:09.694
years old were you at that time? Yes, I was 20. 20 
years old and you were in charge of basically 2,000

29:10.214 --> 29:14.882
cadets? Well, to the extent that a cadet officer 
was in charge. At that time, I would have to say that

29:19.082 --> 29:30.082
the students have a lot more authority and 
responsibility today than we did then. The ROTC

29:30.102 --> 29:33.428
instructors were much more closely associated 
with us and we didn't expect to be given as much

29:35.078 --> 29:44.014
responsibility as young people expect today. So I 
wouldn't say that we were making any great

29:44.034 --> 29:53.070
decisions about things.

30:00.239 --> 30:07.951
What are your feelings on the fact that students 
have more responsibilities today or demand more

30:00.239 --> 30:07.951
responsibilities? Do you think that's positive 
or negative? I think it's very positive. There's

30:14.241 --> 30:21.032
no question in my mind that the young people that 
come to Texas A&M today are far more qualified than

30:14.241 --> 30:21.032
I was in my day. They're far better educated on 
arrival. They're far more competent. They expect

30:27.391 --> 30:31.921
and discharge responsibility better than we did. 
And I'm mighty proud of the developments in

30:33.524 --> 30:39.257
student government and the responsibilities 
that students have.

30:42.393 --> 30:44.177
Now, what were your feelings? I want to talk about 
the ROTC camp. Tell me about the ROTC camp, and tell

30:47.686 --> 30:56.067
me about the other

30:47.686 --> 30:56.067
corpsmen from other colleges. Let's take time out 
for a minute. Okay, time out.
