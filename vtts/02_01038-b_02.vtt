WEBVTT

00:05.195 --> 00:13.546
I think he is the one who engineered the split 
between Joe and Bridges, and I don't remember what

00:05.195 --> 00:13.546
the final thing was over. Could it have been your 
nomination to represent the CIO Maritime

00:15.749 --> 00:22.137
Committee here in Washington? I don't think it 
could have been. It may have been, but I don't think

00:24.800 --> 00:30.848
it could have been.

00:32.583 --> 00:38.449
Because I was working under Bridges Bjorn 
Holling, who was the executive secretary. I was

00:38.469 --> 00:40.592
working under him. And they called him back to San 
Francisco because they had something there that

00:41.953 --> 00:51.503
they thought he could be more effective in than 
what he was doing here. And that's when I was named

00:52.665 --> 00:57.830
as secretary to succeed to head up the committee.

01:00.713 --> 01:02.455
This could have been, although I don't know. I'm 
sure I had a lot of people around who didn't like me.

01:08.522 --> 01:12.088
And some of them I know didn't like me because they 
thought I was too close to Joe. We were very close

01:12.668 --> 01:16.114
personal friends, no question about it. During 
your years as a lobbyist, we'll use that term, here

01:18.437 --> 01:32.037
in Washington, who were some congressmen who were 
favorable to you, who was the NMU's friends?

01:33.535 --> 01:37.659
What was the relationship with Vic Marcantonio? 
Marcantonio?

01:41.763 --> 01:44.646
He would do almost anything he could that we would 
ask him to do.

01:49.411 --> 01:59.982
Just thinking about it, I would say that after I was 
here for maybe a year and a half or two years, that

02:02.307 --> 02:08.194
most of the congressmen that we contacted on 
maritime matters became friends of the Union.

02:11.318 --> 02:19.988
And maybe I'm bragging a little, but let me tell 
you, and you be the judge of what you think.

02:25.035 --> 02:27.638
I had certain basic principles which I followed. 
And I made no bones of those, and incidentally, I

02:32.446 --> 02:39.336
can tell you that they didn't always agree with 
Bridges, and we clashed over them several times.

02:40.218 --> 02:50.353
First of all, I took the position that whatever was 
good for the United States was good for the

02:40.218 --> 02:50.353
merchant marine, not the other way around. I

02:50.393 --> 02:59.466
also took the position that the companies who 
operated those ships were good for the merchant

03:01.488 --> 03:12.179
marine as long as they carried out programs that 
would help to make the merchant marine grow and

03:01.488 --> 03:12.179
help serve the national policy.

03:15.382 --> 03:21.668
I took the position that these people furnished 
jobs for seamen and longshoremen. It was damn time

03:21.788 --> 03:30.617
that we learned that and stopped calling them the 
bosses and start cooperating with them. I and the

03:31.137 --> 03:33.880
communists clashed many times over this. Matter 
of fact, I wrote a guest column for Joe once while he

03:35.501 --> 03:40.767
was away somewhere. I don't know where now, but he 
asked me to write it. And I wrote about

03:43.870 --> 03:45.512
cooperation. In the next issue of the pilot, 
Ferdinand Smith wrote an article attacking that.

03:53.160 --> 03:58.545
It was a party article done by someone in the, 
probably in the then Daily Worker. for him, but it

03:59.167 --> 04:08.221
was so patent that it was a party line attack that 
you couldn't mistake it for anything.

04:11.005 --> 04:18.576
Anyway, they were against cooperating with those 
goddamn ship owners, you know, this sort of crap.

04:20.800 --> 04:35.816
Do you think this perception by Curran and parts of 
the Union anyway, as far as the need to cooperate

04:20.800 --> 04:35.816
with ship owners and with the government, comes 
only after the beginning of the Second World War?

04:35.836 --> 04:37.377
Yes, it was not possible before. No way. No way. 
Because all seamen hated ship owners. It didn't

04:42.583 --> 04:46.487
have to be a communist to hate a ship owner, I can 
guarantee you. because the conditions were so

04:47.918 --> 04:49.960
poor. I mean, they were rotten on ships, really. I 
remember the first ship I was on, no, the second

04:53.664 --> 05:07.299
ship I was on, the second engineer at lunch one day 
said, my God, looky here, looky here. And he took

05:07.319 --> 05:13.566
his spoon and dipped something out of his soup and 
got up and walked around and put it in front of the

05:07.319 --> 05:13.566
captain. Look at that. I found that in my soup. 
Captain said, oh, that's only a half of a

05:19.222 --> 05:23.366
cockroach. Went on eating his soup.

05:30.413 --> 05:38.942
Well, I started to tell you why I thought we built up 
good relations with congressmen.

05:38.962 --> 05:43.386
I always tried to know my facts when I was talking to 
them. And I always tried to leave them a paper. on

05:48.095 --> 05:50.698
what we were talking about, what I was seeking. And 
if there were other alternatives, I tried to

05:52.461 --> 05:59.770
present those alternatives. And if there were 
specific dangers to them individually, I always

05:59.790 --> 06:05.598
presented those. In other words, I never tried to 
sell a congressman something that I wouldn't want

06:06.879 --> 06:17.393
another guy to sell me if I were in his shoes. I tried 
to play the golden rule with them, in other words.

06:22.278 --> 06:24.641
Do to them as I would want somebody to do to me. And I 
think that took part,

06:26.243 --> 06:34.873
had a part in building up relationships with the 
congressmen. I can say up until about 1970,

06:47.292 --> 06:49.776
or maybe a little before that, 68. I don't remember 
the date. But Joe Curran had an extremely good

06:52.080 --> 06:56.006
reputation here in Washington.

07:00.072 --> 07:07.524
And unfortunately, that reputation started to 
wane when he sent his son down here. I don't know

07:09.187 --> 07:11.451
whether 68, 69, or 70. Tal can give you the date on 
that. And his son started screwing things up for

07:14.663 --> 07:18.147
good. For example, one of the first things he did 
was put out a press release attacking Senator

07:19.348 --> 07:27.816
Magnuson. Well, Senator Magnuson wouldn't do any 
damn thing that we asked him to do. That little

07:34.403 --> 07:38.347
bastard came in here, and this was one of the first 
things that he did.

07:41.170 --> 07:44.113
And this started knocking Joe's, well, Now, 
before that, his reputation started to get

07:44.633 --> 07:48.558
knocked down by Bill Perry. Perry had developed a 
habit of calling me on the phone and telling me what

07:50.340 --> 07:59.251
Joe wanted done. Then he would call the person I 
would go to in the government and tell that person

07:59.291 --> 08:11.687
they'd better goddamn sure get this done before I 
even go to the person, tell them. And this started

08:12.123 --> 08:18.290
breaking down the relations of the, you know, the 
reputation of the NMU. What about the

08:19.612 --> 08:21.574
Taft-Hartley Act? How involved were you in 
fighting that? Let me go back a minute, but bring me

08:23.597 --> 08:26.480
back to Taft-Hartley.

08:29.964 --> 08:33.649
Talking about the congressman.

08:37.954 --> 08:40.797
Trying to think of who reminded me of that just 
recently. Anyway, myself and this person walked

08:42.042 --> 08:56.303
into a meeting of the House Merchant Marine 
Fisheries Committee when Herbert Bonner was

08:42.042 --> 08:56.303
chairman. We walked in after I'd been away about 
six weeks on a trip. I came back, and we walked in

09:02.412 --> 09:04.235
together. And Bonner got up and said, now, wait a 
minute. I don't know who was testifying. Stop

09:09.282 --> 09:10.564
right here. Someone just walked in the room I want 
you to know about. Hoyt Haddock just came in. If we

09:17.627 --> 09:21.511
have one annoying thing about the merchant 
marine, he's the man to ask. So he took that guy off

09:22.632 --> 09:25.154
the stand. I wasn't prepared to testify. And I 
said, I want to ask him some questions about this.

09:32.282 --> 09:33.403
And so he did, went on. But I mention that only 
because it's indicative of the fact that I had

09:40.430 --> 09:46.115
built up a personal trust with these people. I 
tried to do it, and I was successful. And I remember

09:49.779 --> 10:10.318
another situation where an attorney who happened 
to be an ex-Congressman, the only Congressman

09:49.779 --> 10:10.318
that Roosevelt purged, if you ever read anything 
about him trying to purge some of the Congressmen,

09:49.779 --> 10:10.318
that was the only Congressman that was ever 
purged, and he was a New York Congressman.

10:10.754 --> 10:15.899
practicing law here, I had testified on some bill 
the day before. And he came in the next day and was

10:17.941 --> 10:28.732
trying to knock down my testimony by sarcastic 
references to me and my testimony. And the ranking

10:29.893 --> 10:39.883
Republican at that time, Thor Tollefson, after 
listening to it for a while, he said, now wait. I

10:41.467 --> 10:46.874
want you to know that as far as I'm concerned, Hoyt 
Haddock is a personal friend of mine. And he said,

10:48.295 --> 10:53.201
we're not holding a hearing here on the character 
of Hoyt Haddock, unfortunately. If we were, I

10:53.802 --> 10:56.786
would be the first witness for him. But we're 
holding a hearing on such and such. And you haven't

11:00.350 --> 11:06.218
told us one thing about this bill that we're 
considering at all. All you've done is sit here and

11:06.318 --> 11:08.881
attack Hoyt Haddock. He said, I'm personally 
tired of it. And if you continue to testify, I'm

11:11.167 --> 11:17.197
getting up and leave, because I don't intend to sit 
here any longer. And Bonner was still chairman

11:17.237 --> 11:18.739
then. And Bonner said, and I couldn't agree more. 
He said, I'm telling you now, if that's the rest of

11:24.949 --> 11:29.897
your testimony, you're finished. I'm perfectly 
content to go ahead and listen to you if you have

11:32.040 --> 11:38.170
something constructive to say. The guy got up and 
left. He didn't have anything constructive to

11:39.699 --> 11:41.942
say. But I only... I don't think I'm egotistical in 
saying those, because I literally set out to build

11:45.106 --> 11:52.274
that kind of relationship with people that I had to 
work with. And I had that kind of relationship with

11:54.556 --> 11:56.719
all of them. For example, Senator Magnuson, after 
one of the elections, there were a number of

11:56.739 --> 12:02.906
changes on his committee. Well, I was over the 
hearing one day, and... Just before the hearing

12:08.153 --> 12:14.000
went up, I got up and went around to the back room 
where they held their executive meetings. And I

12:14.761 --> 12:17.624
was sitting in there talking with some of the 
staff. And he and some of them came in. They were

12:22.850 --> 12:24.772
going to hold an executive session. They decided 
that outside. So he said, well, then we're going to

12:27.515 --> 12:31.660
hold our meeting here. So when he said that, I got up 
and started to go out. He said, no, Hoyt, don't

12:36.335 --> 12:37.957
leave. I want you to stay, because I want these 
people to meet you and know about you. So they had

12:43.322 --> 12:48.787
already decided who was going to be committee 
chairman. And I remember a congressman from

12:50.369 --> 12:58.717
Florida, John, he replaced Claude Pepper. I can't 
think of his name now. John something was in charge

12:59.998 --> 13:05.143
of the land and inland transportation. He said, I 
want all the committee to know that Hoyt Haddock,

13:07.216 --> 13:18.514
when there's anything doing with maritime, 
before I take a position on it, I find out what his

13:07.216 --> 13:18.514
position is. And I normally follow whatever he 
suggests that I follow. And then each one of the

13:24.764 --> 13:34.540
guys asked me, he said,

13:24.764 --> 13:34.540
will you

13:35.026 --> 13:37.128
Give me the kind of help you give Magnuson. I said, 
I'll give you all the help that I can. That's what

13:39.291 --> 13:42.154
I'm paid to do. I said, you must understand that 
when I give you my ideas on things, that they're

13:42.174 --> 13:53.486
only my ideas, and I have as much chance of being 
wrong as anyone else. I said, when I talk to you

13:54.527 --> 14:03.777
about a subject, if you are better prepared on it 
than I, I consider you to have a better

13:54.527 --> 14:03.777
understanding than I. If you're not, I figured 
that you've got a 50% chance of being as right as me.

14:10.113 --> 14:11.295
I said, that's the way I work. That's the way I 
think. And if you ask me a question, I will either

14:13.919 --> 14:25.778
tell you what my opinion is on it, how I think it 
should be handled, or I'll tell you that I don't

14:13.919 --> 14:25.778
know, but I will study it for you and give you an 
opinion. And that's the way I operate. Now, you ask

14:28.984 --> 14:31.628
me, uh, how we got along with the congressman. 
That's the way we got along with them. And we got

14:37.727 --> 14:41.330
along with the administrative people the same 
way. For example, if we had a bill that we wanted to

14:43.012 --> 14:49.058
get through, I didn't start working with the 
Congress on that bill. I started working with the

14:49.138 --> 15:00.670
administration and I would get the appropriate 
administrative agencies that were concerned

14:49.138 --> 15:00.670
that I knew that this bill was going to be referred 
to for reports I would talk to them before we

15:01.072 --> 15:03.475
proceed with that. Then I would go get, after I 
would talk with them, I would go talk to the budget

15:03.976 --> 15:15.592
department and tell them the position, our 
position, and the fact that I discussed this with

15:03.976 --> 15:15.592
the various agencies and what their position was. 
Then I would come to Congress. But that's the way I

15:18.676 --> 15:24.645
operated, and I think we had built up a good 
relationship. What about the Taft-Hartley?

15:34.788 --> 15:43.299
Well, before the Taft-Hartley,

15:34.788 --> 15:43.299
I had testified on the National Labor Relations 
Act. I told them that I thought it was a bad act. I

15:49.206 --> 15:56.315
said it's going to help labor for a while, but it's 
then going to become the enemy of labor, just like

15:49.206 --> 15:56.315
all government agencies. Because you have to 
understand that government agencies are

15:57.877 --> 16:04.626
controlled by the bankers of this country. I said, 
any congressman who is honest knows that. And if he

16:11.140 --> 16:12.963
doesn't know it, he's a damn fool.

16:16.568 --> 16:17.730
So I had that record. And when I came to the 
Taft-Hartley, of course, the whole labor

16:19.092 --> 16:25.882
movement worked on Taft-Hartley. And in the 
Senate, I don't think I testified on Taft-Hartley

16:27.484 --> 16:35.997
in the House. I testified in the Senate and Taft was 
chairman of the committee at the time. I guess that

16:44.488 --> 16:49.034
meant that the Republicans were in power in the 
Congress at the time. I don't know what year this

16:49.114 --> 16:50.336
was. 47,

16:50.356 --> 16:54.141
48.

16:57.705 --> 16:58.947
Boiling it all down.

17:02.335 --> 17:11.726
I have never seen any member, any person testify 
for Taft who was treated so nice as I was by him. I

17:12.667 --> 17:15.431
expected him to cut my throat from ear to ear. But 
literally he was, he couldn't have been nicer if I

17:17.173 --> 17:27.445
were a king visiting his home for the first time as a 
personal friend. I never understood it. Still

17:32.862 --> 17:35.165
don't understand it. But that's the way he treated 
me. Maybe he's trying to kill me with kindness. I

17:38.310 --> 17:38.791
don't know. But he gave everyone a hard time coming 
before that committee, except me. I mean

17:44.239 --> 17:45.000
literally. And representatives of labor here in 
Washington talked about that for at least a year

17:45.701 --> 17:51.790
afterwards. The way he was deferent to me. I don't 
know why, but he was. There was one other situation

17:58.019 --> 18:01.384
we were talking about.

18:04.385 --> 18:06.067
This was also a labor bill. They were having 
hearings on withholding

18:07.489 --> 18:18.261
taxes. And they wanted to

18:19.943 --> 18:29.695
have withholding taxes for merchant seamen 
because of their room and board. You weren't here

18:29.715 --> 18:31.176
then, were you, Tal? You were? Anyway, there was a 
fellow from the electrical workers. What the hell

18:39.397 --> 18:40.298
was his name? Well, he'd been a professor at one of 
the universities in New York. I don't remember his

18:46.545 --> 18:47.666
name now. I can't think of it. Who had prepared a 
tremendous brief on this. Anyway, I went before

18:51.531 --> 19:02.083
him and talked about this position of taxing 
seamen's wages and so forth. And all of the

19:02.519 --> 19:05.742
committee were agreeing with me on it. My approach 
to it was correct because this fitted the

19:07.624 --> 19:13.810
situation that they confronted in their whole 
house. My basic position was that it didn't reduce

19:13.830 --> 19:22.839
the cost of a merchant seaman rent that he had to pay 
because he went to sea. And it only reduced his

19:23.700 --> 19:31.648
grocery bill very insignificantly at all when he 
wasn't at home. because his wife, if she had any

19:32.101 --> 19:38.048
kids, she had to feed those, and she probably 
bought about the same amount of food anyway. You

19:38.889 --> 19:42.713
know, the congressman said, this is the same 
situation that confronts us. The chairman says, I

19:44.275 --> 19:49.601
have a home in Washington State, and I have one 
here. And it don't reduce my expenses when I leave

19:50.722 --> 19:55.107
out there. As a matter of fact, it increases them 
because I come here. But I can readily see, even if I

19:58.912 --> 20:01.855
didn't have a home here, I still have to maintain 
the home out there. It's not going to cost me any

20:04.664 --> 20:06.106
less. And they were agreeing with me. And this 
fellow followed me. And he had a very

20:10.553 --> 20:13.838
well-prepared statement. I mean, it was the kind 
of a statement I would like to have had when I talked

20:13.858 --> 20:19.608
to him. But I didn't have it, because I didn't 
prepare a statement. I added it up to him. And they

20:26.318 --> 20:29.884
started attacking him from the moment he sat down 
there. But the problem was he was talking down to

20:32.041 --> 20:37.048
them. He was educating them as though they were 
children. And they felt this right away. And they

20:44.558 --> 20:46.541
just gave him a hell of a time. And he really had a 
statement that could have convinced anyone. But

20:51.227 --> 20:52.589
he just lost everything. But I mention that 
because I

20:53.890 --> 21:01.761
don't know. It's the way you approach people, I 
guess. It's the only thing I can say. Now, on

21:09.043 --> 21:16.673
talking about Taft-Hartley, I don't to this day 
know why Taft treated me like he did. I literally

21:18.656 --> 21:20.638
thought he was going to give me hell. What about 
moving backwards a ways to the, right after the

21:23.162 --> 21:31.933
war, the threatened, 24-hour strike at the end of 
Utah had. Who was the catalyst behind this? Was

21:39.199 --> 21:41.241
this the 40-hour week strike? The strike after the 
war for wages. For wages. Well, this could have

21:47.849 --> 21:49.871
been the 40-hour week strike. I don't know.

21:54.336 --> 21:59.322
I'm afraid the AFL-CIO Maritime Committee was, 
because this was part of our Part of the program

22:01.445 --> 22:08.411
that I put together, you know, try to get the unions 
to recognize what was coming. If it was the 40-hour

22:08.431 --> 22:14.797
week strike, the catalyst was the then head of the 
American Merchant Marine Institute. I don't know

22:14.897 --> 22:23.545
what the name of it was then, but the fellow who was 
the head of it was a Tammany politician. And he had

22:23.565 --> 22:28.349
told his ship owners, don't worry, there's not 
going to be a strike. Well, Franklin called me up

22:28.369 --> 22:30.591
and asked me, he said, What the hell was that guy's 
name?

22:37.489 --> 22:47.919
He was president of their

22:37.489 --> 22:47.919
committee, whatever they called it, and in charge 
of labor relations.

22:50.802 --> 22:52.703
I said, don't you believe him, Jack. There's going 
to be a strike on the 40-hour week unless he gives in

22:53.144 --> 22:59.390
on it. So OK. He went back to the meeting next day and 
told them that there was going to be a strike. And

23:04.978 --> 23:08.981
this guy said, no, not going to be any strike. 
They're not going to push this 40-hour week. He

23:11.924 --> 23:13.686
called me again and told me. I said, Jack, I can only 
tell you what I know. And right now, I know that

23:18.370 --> 23:24.495
there's going to be a strike unless the 40-hour 
week is granted. And I said, if you don't grant it

23:24.515 --> 23:29.940
before the strike, you will grant it after, and it 
will cost you more money.

23:33.127 --> 23:38.532
So they didn't grant it before the strike, and it 
did cost them more money. In 51 and 52,

23:40.253 --> 24:00.951
was when Murray was beginning to talk about 
stepping down from the CIO before the AFL and the

23:40.253 --> 24:00.951
CIO emerged, was Joe Kern being groomed to become 
the president of the CIO? Not to my knowledge. Not

24:04.244 --> 24:05.225
to my knowledge. How close was his working 
relationship with Philip Murray?

24:13.756 --> 24:16.219
I don't think as close as many others. Philip 
Murray's closest working relationships were

24:18.502 --> 24:26.152
with the steelworkers, whoever was in the 
steelworkers. Many of his people came out of the

24:26.812 --> 24:31.298
steelworker organization into the CIO as a 
result. But I don't think Joe had any particular in

24:32.240 --> 24:37.889
with Murray. I think any good honest person had an 
in with Murray. Murray was a very simple person. If

24:45.141 --> 24:53.895
you believed in what you were trying to do and tried 
to do a good job, you didn't have to do a good job. But

24:53.915 --> 24:57.741
if you really tried to, Murray had respect for you. 
With Joe's heart attack in 52. His what? Heart

25:01.821 --> 25:02.342
attack. I don't remember when it was. Why did he 
step down then? Why? Why didn't he? As I

25:11.270 --> 25:14.432
understand, it was a fairly massive heart attack, 
wasn't it? It was. Yeah, he was out for a long time.

25:22.960 --> 25:24.682
Well, he talked about retiring. Whether he ever 
meant it or not, I don't know. I think most everyone

25:29.176 --> 25:33.483
encouraged him not to retire unless he really had 
to.

25:37.310 --> 25:38.171
I know that I did. I know that Headley Stone did.

25:45.884 --> 25:48.148
Trying to think of who else was there at the time.

25:52.756 --> 25:54.559
I just don't remember who else was there. Now 
outside of the NMU, I don't know who talked to him

25:55.079 --> 26:02.010
about it. Franklin may have. He and Franklin 
became good friends too.

26:09.902 --> 26:11.364
You know, they respected each other. Franklin 
respected his word and he respected Franklin's

26:11.464 --> 26:14.749
word. So by the 50s then, you'd be correct to 
generalize that the NMU had a a good working

26:22.872 --> 26:26.336
relationship with at least most of the steamship 
owners? Yes. The old antagonist, protagonist

26:28.058 --> 26:33.965
days of the 30s were over by then. That's right, I 
think so. And they were cooperative. We had gotten

26:37.990 --> 26:42.015
away from what we call the ship actions by then. You 
know, where you set down one ship over one issue,

26:43.016 --> 26:48.262
whether it was in the contract or not. In other 
words, the crew takes action. What happened with

26:52.960 --> 26:56.143
the passenger ships? Apparently it was one of 
Germany's biggest defeats. Well, they got to the

26:59.686 --> 27:16.181
point where they were so overmanned and so much

26:59.686 --> 27:16.181
corruption existed on them that they weren't

26:59.686 --> 27:16.181
making any money for the companies. Had this been 
verified by the union? passenger ships were

27:21.918 --> 27:24.360
indeed losing money? Oh yes, oh yes. And the 
government was tired of paying subsidies to them

27:26.663 --> 27:43.158
because the subsidies were so big and they really 
weren't contributing anything to the commerce of

27:26.663 --> 27:43.158
the United States in terms of commerce, just 
carrying passengers for pleasure.

27:48.403 --> 27:50.085
The Union worked out several new passenger 
scales, you know, to scale them down. But there was

27:53.771 --> 28:13.686
great resistance towards lowering the scale on 
the passenger ships because the seamen had

27:53.771 --> 28:13.686
become, this time,

27:53.771 --> 28:13.686
had gotten to the position where the old trade 
union principles really didn't exist anymore.

28:13.706 --> 28:16.731
You know, at one time, to become a good trade 
unionist, you had to be a good worker. You had to be a

28:23.108 --> 28:26.352
competent worker in the craft that you were 
following. And they had gotten it this time, where

28:28.194 --> 28:32.099
that was immaterial. What do you think caused 
that, this change in mentality of the average

28:32.599 --> 28:36.144
seaman? I think the union provided too much 
protection for them. They didn't rely upon their

28:45.922 --> 28:50.088
own abilities any longer. They started relying 
solely upon the Union, just like the situation

28:51.209 --> 28:55.315
now. Too many people rely upon the United States 
government. They have no idea of being productive

28:59.221 --> 29:06.751
citizens, of looking out for themselves. They 
want Uncle Sam to look out for them. And I think it's

29:09.135 --> 29:14.342
that same mentality that Seaman wanted the Union 
to look out for them, not themselves. Well, you

29:16.229 --> 29:20.256
can't keep a union strong with that kind of 
mentality.

29:23.982 --> 29:26.546
What about William Perry? The what? William 
Perry. There isn't anything good I can say about

29:30.512 --> 29:32.956
the man. When was he first brought into the union? I 
don't remember the year. Well. It was just before

29:42.368 --> 29:46.292
this convention where this fight took place. What 
was the man's name that Joe tangled with? Joe

29:50.396 --> 29:50.897
Stack? Joe Stack. Joe Stack fired William Perry.

29:57.083 --> 30:02.528
And William Perry came to Joe and asked Joe to put 
him back on a job somewhere. I don't know what the

30:03.509 --> 30:08.975
discussion was, because I was in Washington at 
that time, I think. I'm sure I was. Anyway, Joe put

30:13.300 --> 30:14.682
him back on. Joe was a very soft-hearted guy. He 
would do anything for you. Really, he would. He was

30:21.090 --> 30:25.996
egotistical like all of us, but he did have a very 
soft heart.

30:28.719 --> 30:34.967
Well, hell, if I would go to him and say, Joe, I want 
to go to bed with your wife, Joe would say, all

30:28.719 --> 30:34.967
right. He would walk out of the room. I never tried 
this, but I'm telling you that that's the kind of a

30:38.331 --> 30:42.396
guy he was. If you were his friend, anything that he 
had was yours.

30:50.513 --> 30:54.699
And anything that he wanted from me, he could get, 
no question about that.

31:00.868 --> 31:02.110
But that's one of the things. And William Perry

31:02.871 --> 31:09.801
did everything to build his ego. For example, it 
got to the point where Joe wouldn't buy a suit

31:10.777 --> 31:17.664
without William Perry passing on it. Joe didn't 
get married the second time without William Perry

31:17.684 --> 31:21.247
passing on it. He had that much influence on Joe. 
Was Perry like a father-son relationship or a

31:25.612 --> 31:31.758
relationship of equals? He envisioned Perry as a 
son that he wished Joe Paul could be. I think that

31:40.915 --> 31:43.217
was where the real problem was. In other words, 
Perry was an able guy in his own way, and he could

31:44.519 --> 31:53.407
convince Joe of almost anything. And you know, 
like Joe Paul, Joe Paul decided he wanted to come to

31:55.329 --> 32:03.357
Washington, be a legislative representative. 
Joe sent him down here, become legislative

32:04.118 --> 32:07.581
representative. Joe Paul perceived his job here 
as telling me what to do and how to do it. I tried to

32:16.307 --> 32:20.393
tell him that this wasn't the right way to do it, and 
he would go ahead and do it anyway. And you couldn't

32:22.215 --> 32:26.862
touch Joe on Joe Paul at all. For example, Joe Paul, 
is this on? Well, it doesn't make any difference.

32:31.889 --> 32:32.990
No, take it off. Perry was replacing what Joe was 
missing. And you could say anything against Perry

32:39.893 --> 32:47.821
and Joe wouldn't believe you. In your opinion, 
what do you think Joe Curran's greatest

32:47.841 --> 32:58.652
contributions to maritime labor and to merchant 
seamen were? And what were his greatest

32:58.712 --> 33:06.981
victories?

33:07.720 --> 33:10.043
I guess the greatest victory was starting the 
Union. Really, that was the greatest thing he ever

33:10.924 --> 33:12.967
did. And then keeping it to grow was just all adding 
to it. Did he ever talk to you about what he

33:21.117 --> 33:25.523
considered to be his greatest achievement? Would 
he ever reminisce about something like that? Oh,

33:30.730 --> 33:37.238
we would talk about specific issues, you know, as 
they would happen and maybe go back to some of the

33:37.758 --> 33:44.947
issues and discuss them, but I don't think he ever 
perceived that any one thing was... He was more

33:45.809 --> 33:47.311
proud of than another? What? That he was more proud 
of than another? No, I don't think so. I think he was

33:51.156 --> 33:52.918
just proud of the whole thing. What do you think 
were his greatest feelings? His greatest value

33:57.103 --> 34:02.230
was leadership, personal leadership. What would 
you say his greatest failures were? I

34:08.167 --> 34:13.776
guess his egotism was his greatest failure.

34:16.460 --> 34:19.705
For example, letting a guy like Perry lead him 
around by the nose. And I mean he literally did it.

34:24.252 --> 34:34.107
For example,

34:24.252 --> 34:34.107
they

34:24.252 --> 34:34.107
had a problem on the Americans. I think maybe it 
involved an electrician. Doesn't matter. I don't

34:39.145 --> 34:41.007
remember the details of it. But anyway, it 
involved one man. The company had disciplined

34:44.953 --> 34:48.698
him, and the union wanted the man put back. And they

34:51.061 --> 34:59.594
tied up the ship. But before they did this, Perry 
called me and said, Joe has decided to tie up the

35:06.098 --> 35:27.938
america what do you think i said i don't think it's a 
good idea perry and i wish joe would call me and talk

35:06.098 --> 35:27.938
to me because i think it's very important that he 
know the facts knows the facts the u.s lines has

35:06.098 --> 35:27.938
worked out a deal with a greek steamship company to 
buy the america

35:31.192 --> 35:37.361
And I think that anything that you do now is going to 
deliver that ship from the American flag to the

35:31.192 --> 35:37.361
Greek flag.

35:40.966 --> 35:42.328
Oh, don't worry, I'll tell Joe. Well, he didn't 
tell Joe.

35:48.858 --> 35:57.110
Anyway, Joe asked me to come to New York on the day 
that they were supposed to meet for arbitration on

35:48.858 --> 35:57.110
the issue. This was after they had the ship tied up. 
I told Joe of all of this, what I told Perry. And he

36:07.016 --> 36:09.460
said to Bill, why in the hell didn't you tell me 
this? I didn't tell you because I didn't believe it

36:11.583 --> 36:14.929
was so, and I still don't believe it's so. And Joe 
says, well, I can damn sure check it, and you know I

36:17.313 --> 36:20.258
can check it. Well, go ahead and check it. So Joe 
went and called Franklin, asked him, I understand

36:30.220 --> 36:36.850
that you have a Greek ship owner who wants to buy the 
America and you're ready to sell it to him. Is it so?

36:38.632 --> 36:41.516
I said, yes, that's so. Frankly, I wouldn't lie to 
him. He just told him the truth. So Joe said, thank

36:45.342 --> 36:46.363
you. And he came back and said, you little son of a 
bitch ought to kick your ass right out of here. And

36:51.651 --> 36:54.174
then five minutes later, he forgot about it, I 
guess. Anyway, I said, I think you're wasting time

36:55.456 --> 36:59.502
on the arbitration.

37:01.912 --> 37:05.495
The company's not going to agree to do what you want 
to do on this man. They want you to force them to sell

37:06.576 --> 37:11.080
into a situation where they can sell America. You 
better back out of this.

37:15.765 --> 37:17.206
Joe said, I don't see how I can. I think we have to go 
ahead with the arbitration. I said, if you go ahead

37:19.908 --> 37:23.111
with the arbitration, are you going to accept the 
decision? Not if it's against us. I said, well,

37:25.974 --> 37:27.615
Joe, don't go ahead with it. It's going to be 
against you, believe me. Well, they went ahead

37:31.342 --> 37:33.804
with it, and sure enough, it was against them.

37:37.488 --> 37:38.709
The ship was sold to the Greek. What about the 
Kieran-Paul Hall relationship?

37:47.677 --> 37:54.104
Well, you have to understand the origin, I guess, 
of the SIU to realize that. And I've told you

37:54.204 --> 38:00.910
already that this was the shipowner's answer to 
the National Maritime Union. And...

38:06.614 --> 38:10.079
Were there ever any attempts for the two unions to 
fuse? There has always been good, honest attempts

38:11.741 --> 38:19.252
on the part of the National Maritime Union to put 
the seamen's unions together. And Joe, when he was

38:20.574 --> 38:25.080
leader, was 100% open to this. Shannon Wall, who is 
now president, is 100% open to it. And they've both

38:30.067 --> 38:32.010
worked for it. But there has never wanted, the SIU 
has never wanted to put the unions together.

38:41.165 --> 38:44.228
That's why they have never been wanted, they have 
never been put together. Now,

38:44.269 --> 38:51.778
why Hall didn't want them together, I don't know. 
For example, about, trying

38:54.481 --> 39:01.390
to think of the year.

39:04.458 --> 39:10.607
Maybe about 1953 or 4 or 5 in there somewhere.

39:13.150 --> 39:19.459
There was a meeting of the unions out in the 
maritime unions over some issue. I don't know what

39:19.499 --> 39:21.082
the issue was either. Out in Cincinnati under the 
chairmanship of the then president of the Railway

39:22.363 --> 39:31.536
Clerks Organization. And Joe asked me to go out 
there to the meeting with him. I did go out and after

39:34.647 --> 39:45.017
the meeting I stayed overnight because I couldn't 
get a plane back to Washington that night and Joe

39:34.647 --> 39:45.017
went on to New York. Paul stayed there. I don't know 
the reason. He was probably coming to Washington

39:48.881 --> 39:50.543
too. I don't remember now. But anyway, I sat down 
with him and talked with him about the merger for a

39:52.084 --> 39:57.069
long time. And I said, Paul is it a question of 
leadership that's keeping you from wanting a

40:04.735 --> 40:11.024
merger? He said, no, I want a merger. It's Joe Kern 
keeping the merger apart. I said, Paul, you're not

40:16.172 --> 40:19.957
talking to a kid now. I said, I've been in this 
organization business for some time, and I've

40:19.977 --> 40:28.630
been a personal friend of Joe Kern's ever since he 
hit the bricks in New York. So don't tell me about

40:29.471 --> 40:31.094
Joe Kern. I know about Joe Kern. I want to know about 
Joe. I said, if it's a question of you becoming

40:34.030 --> 40:42.783
president of the organization, tell me. It can be 
worked out. He said, what do you mean it can be

40:46.169 --> 40:47.951
worked out? That can't be worked out. Joe wouldn't 
go for anything like that. I said, Paul, if you want

40:52.638 --> 41:00.831
a merger, I will tell you now that you can have a 
merger of the SIU and the NMU. with Joe Kern being

41:02.887 --> 41:06.072
made as president for six months. And at the end of 
that six months, you're taking over as president.

41:11.521 --> 41:13.204
I said, would that give you any problem? He said, 
no, that wouldn't give me any problem. I said,

41:18.192 --> 41:19.354
well, what's the problem? I never did get an answer 
to what the problem was. But there was never any

41:24.842 --> 41:27.747
merger as long as Paul Hall was alive. But Joe was 
ready to step aside at any time there was a merger.

41:34.245 --> 41:35.966
At that time, he wanted to retire. This was in the 
50s after his heart attack? This was in the 50s.

41:41.551 --> 41:50.119
Speaking of retirement, why did, in your opinion, 
did Joe Kern stay on as union president until 1973?

41:52.041 --> 41:53.602
And when he did retire, did he consult with you? 
Yes, he did. I think he didn't retire because he

41:56.145 --> 41:59.708
didn't think he had built anyone who was capable of 
taking over, and he hadn't. And he recognized this

42:04.309 --> 42:08.717
as a big shortcoming on his part. So he wanted to try 
to get someone who was capable of taking over.

42:19.717 --> 42:20.959
So he waited that long. He had had plans then to 
retire much earlier. Yes, he had. He had wanted to

42:24.747 --> 42:26.449
retire for some time. I said the middle of the 50s. 
You know, this could have been the middle of the

42:28.530 --> 42:32.974
60s, just as well as the 50s. I just don't remember 
dates. There's no way I can do it. The only way I can

42:37.098 --> 42:41.882
remember is the Cincinnati meeting, whenever it 
took place. Well, it would have to have been before

42:43.564 --> 42:45.445
the merger. When was the merger? 55? No. I believe 
it was 55, wasn't it? It starts and talks in 52 and

42:51.291 --> 42:53.893
53. Well, it was before the merger. No, it was after 
the merger because the railway clerk's guy was an

42:57.784 --> 43:01.629
AFL guy. It had to be after the merger.

43:05.614 --> 43:07.216
Well, whenever it was anyway. But Joe wanted to 
retire at that time. And he told me specifically

43:12.803 --> 43:22.615
that he would like to put the merger together and if 
it meant for him not being an officer in the merger,

43:12.803 --> 43:22.615
he would do it. but he would also like very much to be 
the first president of that merged organization.

43:29.426 --> 43:37.076
You know, he wanted that very badly and made no 
bones about it, but he said, I'm willing to step

43:29.426 --> 43:37.076
aside from that if it can't be accomplished 
without it.

43:42.523 --> 43:50.273
I never recommended but one person to Joe Curran in 
my life, and that happened to be Shannon Wall. I'd

43:51.333 --> 43:57.581
met Shannon Wall at a CIO convention held in Los 
Angeles. Shannon was agent at the San Diego Hall

43:58.642 --> 44:04.189
for the NMU. And I told Joe of my meeting with him, my 
having meals with him a couple of times and talking

44:06.031 --> 44:13.160
with him about problems. I said, of all of the 
agents, Joe, that you've ever had, In my opinion,

44:20.881 --> 44:38.005
this is the best organized individual of any of 
them, understands more clearly what the issues

44:20.881 --> 44:38.005
are than any of them, and has the greater facility 
of talking about those problems.

44:41.891 --> 44:49.622
The next election,

44:41.891 --> 44:49.622
he was put on the slate by Joe

44:50.733 --> 44:52.174
I guess it was vice president. I'm not sure now 
whether it was vice president or

44:52.295 --> 44:55.398
secretary-treasurer. Anyway, it was brought to 
the national office.

45:00.823 --> 45:07.850
It was not, it was not, it was not 
secretary-treasurer because that came up later.

45:08.931 --> 45:18.280
Joe was going to name a fellow by the name of Mel 
Baricic as secretary-treasurer. I said, Joe, Do

45:20.247 --> 45:23.391
you realize that this man can't write a letter? And 
he knows nothing about keeping books. Has no grasp

45:29.579 --> 45:32.202
of either one of these issues. This is going to mean 
that he's got to hire someone to do all this for him.

45:37.449 --> 45:38.771
I said, I'm not opposed to that. But he's got to be 
able to make a determination about what someone

45:39.772 --> 45:44.659
does for him, whether it's right or not. Joe says, 
you're right. So he changed that and brought

45:49.947 --> 45:51.604
Shannon.
