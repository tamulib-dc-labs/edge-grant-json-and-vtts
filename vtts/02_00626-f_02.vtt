WEBVTT

00:01.195 --> 00:09.064
But he's been very active in the kind of political 
aspects of these things and so on. And he certainly

00:09.084 --> 00:15.471
ought to have

00:09.084 --> 00:15.471
a talk with you now. Now, when research vessels, 
obviously you don't have any when you come here.

00:23.039 --> 00:23.580
What do you do? How do you go about it? What kind do 
you try to choose? What do you want your

00:25.982 --> 00:27.624
undergraduates to have? Just tell me about it. 
Here, we were influenced a good deal by also local

00:31.807 --> 00:43.680
tradition and so on. And when I arrived here in 51, 
the department, primarily under Dr. Barnes's, I

00:44.561 --> 00:58.877
think, impetus, had obtained through sort of 
government surplus, a small vessel that had been

00:59.296 --> 01:11.773
originally built by the Bureau of Commercial 
Fisheries. She was about 115 feet long, wood hull,

01:12.074 --> 01:28.797
and had been designed not as a fishing vessel, but 
essentially as a small kind of passenger and

01:12.074 --> 01:28.797
freight vessel to take care of supplying 
fisheries

01:29.030 --> 01:34.216
programs up in Alaska and so on. So she had an 
interesting sort of characteristic that she

01:34.236 --> 01:53.240
could, although she was a small vessel, she could 
accommodate quite a large number of passengers

01:34.236 --> 01:53.240
and had a large hold, which in effect we were able to 
convert to a sort of laboratory. She was not,

01:54.061 --> 01:58.446
didn't have a great deal of deck space and so on. But 
this vessel had been procured and it required a

01:58.763 --> 02:10.158
certain amount of conversion as they always do and 
also the installation of necessary winches and so

01:58.763 --> 02:10.158
on. We used this what was in a sense a very small type 
vessel up until we obtained the the Thompson,

02:23.468 --> 02:30.678
which is one of these Agars, in about 1965 or 66. So 
we used Brown Bear for about 15 years, and not only

02:31.258 --> 02:53.188
for local work inside Puget Sound and so on and off 
the coast, but we took her out into the North

02:31.258 --> 02:53.188
Pacific. not but she was range limited as well as so 
size limited and so it was sort of gulf of alaska and

02:53.945 --> 03:22.669
so on but out along the illusion chain and in 1964 
and i'm sorry 19

02:53.945 --> 03:22.669
must be 19 1959, 1960, we actually took her north up 
into the Bering Sea and actually into the Arctic.

03:32.919 --> 03:43.273
So we extended, we stretched her capabilities 
just about as much as and maybe beyond sort of

03:44.198 --> 03:47.102
reasonable limits. But she proved to be a very kind 
of efficient vessel in that she could be operated

03:47.202 --> 03:57.015
with a fairly small crew and so on. And we thought we 
got a lot of good work out of her. When she was

04:02.662 --> 04:06.928
replaced by the T.G. Thompson, we were We were 
clearly sort of vessel limited, but we ended up

04:08.701 --> 04:35.029
with a real sort of problem here in the fact that we 
were really rather reluctant to take on one of

04:08.701 --> 04:35.029
these AGARs, but had been told repeatedly by ONR 
and NSF that the vessel would be completely

04:08.701 --> 04:35.029
funded, because It was almost an order of 
magnitude jump here in the cost of operations and

04:35.414 --> 04:42.325
so on. And so we finally did. And of course, we no 
sooner had delivery of the ship than they said they

04:44.068 --> 04:50.317
couldn't budget it. And the department has really 
been fighting ever since to, in a sense, get

04:50.337 --> 05:03.598
adequate vessels, operation support for the 
vessels. And one thing we did not get involved in,

05:05.047 --> 05:26.683
and it was done intentionally, and it may be hard to 
tell whether we were right or wrong, but we never

05:05.047 --> 05:26.683
got involved in anything like the Indian Ocean 
Expedition. or even going back prior to that to the

05:26.900 --> 05:41.502
IGY, of using this as a mechanism, in a sense, to 
expand the fleet and so on, which was clearly done,

05:26.900 --> 05:41.502
I think, at some of the institutions. They used 
these major national efforts to increase the size

05:47.521 --> 05:50.705
of their fleet. But we've never felt we had quite 
the same, or I never felt, maybe I should say, and I

05:50.785 --> 06:06.462
know some of the faculty would agree with me, that 
we should try and do the same kind of things as

05:50.785 --> 06:06.462
Scripps and Woods Hole did. But we had our own 
destiny to try and work out here, which didn't

06:06.482 --> 06:16.954
necessarily involve these very extensive 
sea-going cruises. Did you expect all your

06:17.896 --> 06:22.182
undergraduates to work on the vessel out at sea? 
Oh,

06:23.283 --> 06:47.717
I think I would have said yes if you go back to the 
early 50s or something, but

06:23.283 --> 06:47.717
we got very much caught up with this, the Sputnik 
era here. with increased interest in science and

06:48.035 --> 06:51.861
so on. And certainly the ocean became a very 
romantic sort of an area of study. And so our

07:02.476 --> 07:12.591
undergraduate program shot up at a rate that I 
don't think we would ever have sort of predicted.

07:13.128 --> 07:23.585
And our undergraduate enrollment in 
oceanography was increasing about 25% a year,

07:13.128 --> 07:23.585
which means it doubled every three years. And we 
went from one student or something in 1952, and we

07:24.366 --> 07:40.131
were up to, I think, over 800

07:42.102 --> 07:45.186
Well, the early 60s, I guess it was. And, I mean, it 
was clearly obvious you couldn't do the kind of

07:46.628 --> 08:03.949
things that we'd originally had in mind, which, as 
I think I mentioned earlier, a really sort of

07:46.628 --> 08:03.949
practical preparation of sea work and so forth. 
And it got to a point that We couldn't even give

08:07.617 --> 08:17.848
laboratories

08:07.617 --> 08:17.848
with our formal courses because we didn't have the 
capacity to handle this number of students. So

08:17.868 --> 08:26.257
even the kind of laboratory work clearly suffered 
under this expansion. It was very exciting, but

08:27.318 --> 08:33.625
I think probably went too far. Now, I don't know 
what the later, what's happening in the last year

08:34.935 --> 08:43.006
or two, but it's dropped down considerably, the 
undergraduate enrollment. But it, in a sense, got

08:43.106 --> 08:57.526
overinflated here, but not really due to our 
recruiting efforts or anything, but just because

08:43.106 --> 08:57.526
of general popular interest. And we've done a lot 
of things other than just the sort of formal

09:03.608 --> 09:26.142
undergraduate

09:03.608 --> 09:26.142
and graduate training here, in that

09:03.608 --> 09:26.142
it started back in the days where I really felt we 
did need to provide some input of students and so

09:03.608 --> 09:26.142
on, which involved working with high school 
teachers and so on. I ran summer institutes for for

09:29.461 --> 09:38.933
high school teachers for a number of years here 
with the idea that, you know, they'd encourage

09:29.461 --> 09:38.933
some of their students to come into the field. I've 
been involved in the writing of two high

09:39.735 --> 09:52.391
school-level textbooks, and so we did that. And 
one of the things which had started before the war

09:59.296 --> 10:18.103
And it was a general sort of introductory 
oceanography course, which still carries the

09:59.296 --> 10:18.103
number of Oceanography 101, which was in no way 
intended for our own majors, but a science

09:59.296 --> 10:18.103
orientation course. And most of the students who 
take it are not even science students, but

10:19.005 --> 10:27.998
humanities and social science students. We were 
teaching. That's a five-credit course. And a few

10:31.254 --> 10:36.720
years ago, at least, we were teaching that to over 
1,500 students a year. So we build up, certainly. I

10:42.466 --> 10:53.277
must have some sort of general public awareness of 
the field, at least. And I think these are

10:53.297 --> 10:58.142
worthwhile things, not just sort of promotional. 
But anybody living around here, I think, ought to

11:00.791 --> 11:09.262
know a little bit about what the ocean is like.

11:09.282 --> 11:13.668
So that's still going on. When you started to 
outfit these early vessels, did you have a

11:13.688 --> 11:17.793
professional captain do something? Something 
like James Fawn, I'm thinking of. Or did you try to

11:19.575 --> 11:21.177
do it within your department? No, we started out in 
a sort of small way here, and the first man we had who

11:21.815 --> 11:41.595
was skipper of, he'd been a skipper of an even 
smaller vessel before the Brown Bear, had no sort

11:21.815 --> 11:41.595
of formal training as an officer. He had been a 
fisherman primarily, and a small boat operator

11:45.152 --> 11:56.207
type person, and came in and kind of learned the job 
as he went along. He was a marvelous individual,

11:56.287 --> 12:07.262
and Frank Princehouse, and

11:56.287 --> 12:07.262
very much interested in the in the what we were 
trying to do and extremely cooperative and very

12:07.647 --> 12:36.861
good at taking care of the vessel and the crew and so 
on we actually had to see that he got the

12:07.647 --> 12:36.861
opportunity to get some sort of special training 
and so on when the thompson came along because

12:07.647 --> 12:36.861
otherwise he couldn't have been captain on the 
thompson unfortunately he uh shortly after we got

12:07.647 --> 12:36.861
the thompson he developed a serious ailment and 
and since died but uh he was captain on her for about

12:37.837 --> 13:03.456
a year or so and then we went to these morris out of 
professionally trained uh officers and uh i think

12:37.837 --> 13:03.456
the man that's captain now is uh the thompson that 
came to us from scripps having been on one of their

12:37.837 --> 13:03.456
their ships so there's been a switch there but it's 
partly Related, again, just to the size of the

13:03.706 --> 13:14.403
vessels and the kind of Coast Guard regulations 
about the types of officers that you have to have on

13:03.706 --> 13:14.403
board.

13:16.446 --> 13:23.937
When you first come to Washington, the funding for 
oceanography and oceanographic departments was

13:16.446 --> 13:23.937
sort of a block funding. That is, that... When I 
came out here. When you came out here, right. Yes.

13:27.944 --> 13:32.110
Is that ONR and so forth would get sort of a block 
funding to a university, which has moved...

13:32.309 --> 13:35.092
recently to sort of special project fundings. 
What sort of feeling do you have about that as it

13:35.112 --> 13:38.956
affects the way you try to work your department? 
Well, of course, I've been out of this for about 10

13:38.976 --> 13:43.181
years. But I just think it's been a very 
unfortunate sort of trend. And I keep hoping I can

13:53.853 --> 13:58.297
see some sign that's going to reverse itself. But I 
don't think I have been able to see anything so far.

14:02.583 --> 14:17.807
that, yes, although in a sense, in terms of the 
total dollars, they were small now compared to

14:02.583 --> 14:17.807
what's being transferred

14:02.583 --> 14:17.807
these days. Nevertheless, they were relatively 
large amounts. And in the first few years, when

14:22.154 --> 14:30.227
essentially all our support came from ONR, it 
almost used to be done by letter. they'd send us a

14:30.848 --> 14:33.992
letter saying, what do you want to do? And we'd 
write a letter back saying, we think it'd be fun to

14:34.133 --> 14:37.257
do so. And they'd say, well, we think we can give you 
X thousand dollars next year, and why don't you

14:37.337 --> 14:44.427
write a request for that? And we'd write another 
letter saying, we'd like to have so much for next

14:44.447 --> 14:48.713
year, and that was it. But since then, it has gone 
progressively towards more agencies involved,

14:50.936 --> 14:59.488
which in a way, is life insurance, I think, from our 
point of view, because not all of them go up and down

15:00.616 --> 15:08.949
at the same time. So it gives you some sort of 
security in that way. But the fact that the

15:14.017 --> 15:25.695
projects have been split down and down and down and 
down until you get the situation, which I feel

15:25.912 --> 15:42.454
prevails today where money is not allocated 
really to, although legally it comes to the

15:25.912 --> 15:42.454
university and to the department, it's based on 
these individual sort of proposals. And what

15:43.015 --> 15:50.265
people do is start talking about my money and my 
ship time and so forth. And so that it I think that

15:55.156 --> 16:09.760
from an administrative point of view, it's 
essentially an intolerable situation and that

15:55.156 --> 16:09.760
the chairman of the department has no way of 
administering. All he's doing is trying to fit

16:10.722 --> 16:21.940
together all these little bits and pieces, and he 
has no way of fitting things together in most

16:10.722 --> 16:21.940
cases. and saying, OK, you two fellows get 
together, use the ship jointly or something. They

16:28.333 --> 16:31.877
both say, well, I got my money to do so and so on. And 
it's completely sort of ridiculous. I think it's a

16:35.861 --> 16:43.850
part of sort of Parkinson's law here that this is 
the way in which a bureaucracy functions. It tends

16:43.950 --> 16:45.952
to generate work for itself. And this is exactly 
what I can see is happening in Washington. If you

16:50.489 --> 17:04.007
can have 100 projects under your guidance rather 
than 10, you've got that much more paper and you

16:50.489 --> 17:04.007
justify that many more positions and so on. But 
this plus the fact that there are many, many more

17:04.027 --> 17:17.745
sort of bookkeeping requirements these days than 
there used to be, it really makes it a... major sort

17:18.080 --> 17:26.974
of problem, I think, from the administrative 
point of view, to do these things. The problem, I

17:26.994 --> 17:40.915
think, is sort of being compounded recently by the 
fact that we've got into this

17:26.994 --> 17:40.915
multi-institutional

17:26.994 --> 17:40.915
pattern here. I haven't had any direct part of any 
of these things, but I don't know how they managed

17:41.232 --> 17:53.745
to do those things and keep them going. But even the 
Sea Grant program was originally thought of as a

17:53.765 --> 18:00.572
sort of block funding type thing. And even there, 
without any kind of appropriate authorization

18:00.633 --> 18:09.602
from Congress or anything, they went off in the 
same direction breaking things down into

18:10.645 --> 18:14.731
ridiculously small things. And there's all the 
paperwork involved with this, as well as the lack

18:14.751 --> 18:22.441
of flexibility. The other thing that's been 
happening here is the fact that you're committed

18:22.802 --> 18:37.342
to making plans longer and longer in advance, that 
you want any kind of major support these days.

18:37.402 --> 18:40.146
You've probably got a plan about three years ahead 
and hard to get it. The result is, by the time this

18:42.954 --> 18:48.762
third year's rolled around, you have absolutely 
no flexibility. If things have changed or

18:48.982 --> 18:54.510
something, you're kind of stuck with things. So 
the planning's fine, but it certainly, you lose

18:55.431 --> 19:05.525
any kind of choice in things.

19:08.088 --> 19:09.610
A lot of the problems that have come from the 
combination of inflation and reduced funding and

19:11.007 --> 19:24.945
so on, all have really been most critical since I 
stepped aside as chairman of the department. And I

19:24.965 --> 19:38.061
thought I was leaving everything and looked rosy 
at the time that I decided that I would step down as

19:24.965 --> 19:38.061
chairman. And in a sense, I probably couldn't have 
chosen a better time. But I certainly had no

19:43.726 --> 19:50.716
anticipation of what was going to happen. What 
about the division of agencies, which you

19:51.858 --> 19:54.522
mentioned earlier? Let me sketch something for 
you. ONR becomes more mission-oriented as it

19:58.426 --> 20:06.239
advances upward after World War II, let's say 
particularly after 1949. And you begin to have the

20:06.780 --> 20:14.733
rise of NSF and other scientific agencies to 
administer oceanography. Was this essentially a

20:14.753 --> 20:15.915
good thing? Well, the...

20:28.312 --> 20:36.100
I think it was for probably many different sort of 
reasons. But ONR was obviously strictly a Navy

20:36.120 --> 20:53.398
type thing, although in the early days they 
certainly interpreted their responsibilities

20:36.120 --> 20:53.398
very broadly, I think, relatively speaking. But 
there were areas that they were sort of not

20:53.438 --> 20:57.002
touching at all. But essentially, at least my 
interpretation is that sort of out of the ONR model

20:57.708 --> 21:07.038
came this idea for NSF. And NSF was set up, as I 
recall, in 1951. Let's see, the first director was

21:12.004 --> 21:18.872
moved over from ONR. Remember, wasn't it? Yeah. 
Waterman.

21:24.927 --> 21:25.528
so on. But the general situation was that ONR would 
continue to support oceanography. NSF would get

21:33.857 --> 21:37.622
into, essentially, other fields. And NSF really 
didn't get into oceanography to any, I think I'm

21:38.723 --> 21:53.820
right in saying, any kind of significant extent 
until the IGYK program came along, which was

21:38.723 --> 21:53.820
actually in what was it, 57, 58, but where the 
funding must have predated that by a year or so. And

22:01.991 --> 22:23.959
I think NSF picked that up because, well, it was not 
just oceanography, there were many other

22:01.991 --> 22:23.959
aspects, but it would not have been appropriate 
for ONR to have gone into all of these other fields

22:01.991 --> 22:23.959
besides oceanography, certainly some of them. so 
this is really what moved nsf into the into the

22:24.378 --> 22:48.799
picture and they've essentially never been out of 
it since and it's the the sort of drift of things has

22:24.378 --> 22:48.799
been such that we've been told various times well 
nsf is going to pick up more and more of this and I

22:49.640 --> 22:51.824
don't know quite what has happened. ONR seemed to 
be sort of going down in level of support as far as

22:52.104 --> 23:03.342
they were concerned here, but now I hear that maybe 
they're coming up again and so on. What has been

23:03.663 --> 23:09.893
difficult is for us, and we're not alone in this, is 
to how do you sort of deal with ONR, NSF, AEC, which

23:10.193 --> 23:29.980
no longer exists under that name, but how do you 
keep some sort of a balance or whatever with these

23:10.193 --> 23:29.980
different agencies? And very often I feel that we 
have been in a position of kind of divide and

23:30.240 --> 23:39.272
conquer, that where all the money and so forth 
existed in Washington, they were the ones who got

23:39.472 --> 23:52.220
together and decided, well, we'll support this 
institution to such and such a level. We're put in

23:52.902 --> 23:56.670
the position of asking people for in a sense 
overlapping kind of support i don't think this is

23:57.967 --> 24:24.396
actually done but i mean you know you never know 
quite what's going to come out of these things so i

23:57.967 --> 24:24.396
think it's been a kind of a scary game here and and uh 
aec turned out to be a fairly substantial

23:57.967 --> 24:24.396
supporter for our work here and entirely on sort of 
environmental studies although they were

23:57.967 --> 24:24.396
related to to essentially radioactive materials 
that might get into the Columbia River and so on. So

24:33.001 --> 24:38.249
that was a concern to them, but they were a kind of 
major supporter here. It seems almost to an

24:39.291 --> 24:52.091
outsider that it's as if oceanographers looked at 
what the government wanted and planned a research

24:39.291 --> 24:52.091
topic they might get funded rather than moving out 
and directing research to what interested them.

24:52.392 --> 24:52.712
Is that a fact? I think so, and of course there's 
always the

24:53.941 --> 25:22.733
kind of argument here about freedom of research 
and so forth, and I think all of the agencies have

24:53.941 --> 25:22.733
made quite a conscious effort to play fair on this 
thing, but the fact is that they do influence you a

25:23.185 --> 25:31.417
good deal, not by telling you what to do, but by 
refusing to support things that they didn't want

25:23.185 --> 25:31.417
to do. So things do become very much controlled in 
this way, and exceedingly difficult to get sort of

25:31.517 --> 25:52.247
new things started, and particularly to get sort 
of younger men started and so on here.

25:53.020 --> 26:08.955
So I think it reached a point where there was a sort 
of undesirable

25:53.020 --> 26:08.955
amount of control over what goes on. Sure, you do 
things where the money is. Now, we've chosen in a

26:11.858 --> 26:15.442
few cases not to go where the money was. We didn't 
participate at all in this Indian Ocean

26:16.322 --> 26:21.087
expedition. by choice. We were asked at one time if 
we wanted to get involved in a lot of the Antarctic

26:23.032 --> 26:30.301
operations, and we said, no, thank you. We didn't 
want to. We, I guess, here have operated a little

26:33.345 --> 26:49.825
bit more on a sort of an individual basis, and have 
not participated maybe as much in some of these of

26:50.260 --> 26:55.146
multi-institutional programs that have been 
coming along here in recent years. Some of the

26:55.907 --> 26:57.429
individuals have. They've participated and gone 
on and so on. Now, we did get quite involved here for

27:00.492 --> 27:17.753
several years as part of the international, 
what's it called, international biological

27:00.492 --> 27:17.753
program on this upwelling program. But we've more 
or less operated

27:17.969 --> 27:25.781
more by ourselves, in a way. Is this because of the 
undergraduate emphasis here? No, I don't think

27:30.408 --> 27:33.032
one could say that. Although

27:33.072 --> 27:43.268
the good many that they of the faculty are involved 
in teaching, either at the undergraduate or

27:43.889 --> 27:58.272
graduate level, which means that they're not 
entirely free to go off for long periods without

27:43.889 --> 27:58.272
making appropriate sort of adjustments and 
reallocations.

28:00.616 --> 28:06.405
No, I think it's more sort of individual choices. I 
may be overemphasizing this in a way,

28:13.268 --> 28:42.263
One

28:13.268 --> 28:42.263
thing that I sort of fought against for a number of 
years was getting involved in

28:13.268 --> 28:42.263
this

28:13.268 --> 28:42.263
general sort of marine geophysics, this 
refraction and reflection, seismic shooting and

28:13.268 --> 28:42.263
so on, which involved carrying explosives and 
was, in a sense, a kind of hazardous thing. And I

28:49.154 --> 28:51.817
said, I didn't think we ought to get into that. 
There were two or three institutions that were

28:51.878 --> 28:55.141
heavily involved in it. Why did we have to get into 
it? Well, lo and behold, some money came along, and

28:57.604 --> 29:04.332
we were doing it. And we no sooner got started on it 
than ONR cut off the support. So we were probably

29:08.477 --> 29:12.402
being well advised never to get really sort of 
committed to that thing. And I think there have

29:16.557 --> 29:22.262
been probably some similar sort of things. I

29:22.422 --> 29:42.642
think if one took a really sort of objective view of 
things, one would find that The programs in this

29:43.482 --> 29:52.071
country are pretty much sort of what the federal 
government agencies want them to be. There's very

29:53.132 --> 29:56.936
little sort of independence here now. They can 
always turn around and say that anybody who wants

29:56.956 --> 30:09.228
to can submit a proposal on anything they think 
they want to do, and that if something isn't going

29:56.956 --> 30:09.228
on, it's because nobody's interested in doing the 
work. So they're kind of stuck on this. I, just as

30:13.604 --> 30:24.883
for fun here several years ago, I dreamed up a 
rhetorical question. I asked Professor Rattray

30:24.903 --> 30:29.371
whether I could have the Thompson for a couple of 
weeks. And he said, what do you want the Thompson

30:29.431 --> 30:31.114
for? And I said, oh, I'm not going to tell you, but 
I've got an idea that I want to test. Can I have the

30:36.343 --> 30:38.346
ship for a couple of weeks? And he thought for a 
while, and he said, well, he guessed I could. It

30:44.439 --> 30:50.047
would require some telephoning to Washington to 
get some funds reallocated and so on. But if I

30:50.067 --> 30:53.171
really had a good thing, I could probably get the 
ship. And I said, what about some people to help me?

30:55.695 --> 30:59.020
And he said, oh, no, no people. Everybody's 
committed, you see, to other programs. So I had,

31:04.047 --> 31:07.152
this was just, hypothetical question, but it 
indicates how tied up you are with the system in a

31:07.452 --> 31:14.864
way. We had a, we've mentioned it at lunchtime 
here, we had this drought situation this year, and

31:14.884 --> 31:23.218
it was more than just a local drought. Something 
very unusual has been
