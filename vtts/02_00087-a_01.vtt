cooler outside and have the pleasure of chatting 
with a fellow graduate of high school in orange

00:25.646 --> 00:39.586
Mike Godwin try your mic test testing this is Mike 
Godwin.

00:44.113 --> 00:48.820
Mike why did you attend A&M instead of some other 
school what led you to make that choice. Well,

00:49.306 --> 01:14.250
although my father was not an Aggie, in fact my 
father only took a couple of courses at Lamar

00:49.306 --> 01:14.250
University in Beaumont, he had been a lifelong 
Aggie fan and we attended a lot of football games as

00:49.306 --> 01:14.250
I was growing up going to College Station and I 
would say it was really the football game and the

00:49.306 --> 01:14.250
traditions and the band and all of those things 
that They convinced me and we were fortunate

01:14.230 --> 01:27.900
enough to see the famous football game probably in 
1965 that had the Texas special sitting in the end

01:14.230 --> 01:27.900
zone when they pulled that trick off. And that sort 
of cinched it for me that that's where I wanted to

01:27.960 --> 01:30.906
go. That quarterback had been in my freshman 
history 105 class. When you came as a freshman, how

01:37.360 --> 01:40.464
did you get there? How did you arrive and what did 
you bring with you? Well, I came in, you know, all

01:43.708 --> 01:54.582
full of expectations and cockiness, I think a lot 
of us did. And my first memories were when the

01:54.562 --> 02:00.908
parents were standing around, how nice the 
upperclassmen were. But as soon as the parents

02:00.969 --> 02:05.253
were out of shouting range, it changed very 
quickly. And I would say the first 24 hours at A&M

02:05.333 --> 02:11.519
was a real adjustment. You came, your parents 
brought you in the car? Brought me in the car. And

02:15.043 --> 02:16.024
you didn't have a car? Didn't have a car, no. Never 
had a car until my senior year. What gear, what

02:19.127 --> 02:21.970
stuff did you bring? I don't even remember. It 
wasn't much though. I mean you weren't allowed

02:25.704 --> 02:28.413
that many things. I don't remember anything. And 
you were in the Corps? In the Corps, in F-1. Why that

02:33.451 --> 02:34.575
unit? I started out in engineering and that was an 
engineering outfit and arrived on campus

02:34.775 --> 02:40.941
actually that year. We arrived on campus before 
school started because the first football game

02:42.863 --> 02:52.433
that year was actually, as I recall, a couple days 
before classes actually began. So they took a

02:52.553 --> 03:03.043
bunch of high school kids that didn't know 
anything about the Corps or military and all of a

02:52.553 --> 03:03.043
sudden we were marching and trying to get ready for 
that first football game. And describe your room

03:03.884 --> 03:09.432
and your roommate, your official lady. My 
official lady actually was a fellow named Edward

03:10.313 --> 03:15.000
Hickey who came with us. There were, I actually 
went to a very small Catholic high school in

03:15.020 --> 03:19.707
Orange, Texas. There were I think 36 graduates out 
of that class and four of us went to A&M. And I'd like

03:26.777 --> 03:30.482
to think that the other three came because I 
encouraged them to go. Edward Hickey was one of

03:30.462 --> 03:35.490
them, and he and I were fish roommates that first 
year. Where, what dorm and so forth?

03:42.321 --> 03:43.222
I don't even remember. I believe it was, the whole 
time I was there, we were even in the, I don't even

03:43.282 --> 03:53.498
remember the actual names, dorm two and dorm four. 
Okay. In fact, the core headquarters, I believe,

03:54.220 --> 03:57.685
was in two. And I think that's where we first 
started out my fish year. And what was the nickname

04:03.637 --> 04:05.360
for your outfit? Did it have a nickname? The Finest 
First, which is not even there anymore. And then my

04:10.329 --> 04:22.170
fish year, we won, I think probably my first two 
years, we were the General Moore outfit for Best

04:10.329 --> 04:22.170
All-Around Outfits. make believe that I had known 
nothing about what it was like to be a freshman at

04:22.960 --> 04:31.709
Texas A&M describe your fish year. It was not 
always a lot of fun. First of all, the whole thing.

04:42.141 --> 04:48.708
It's amazing when equalizer when two things 
happen when you get your head shaved, and

04:42.141 --> 04:48.708
everybody's dressed to life. And I think it was a 
very good experience. although it was a sobering

04:52.812 --> 04:57.479
experience. Having grown up as an only child, I 
wasn't used to having a lot of people telling me

04:57.520 --> 05:03.790
what to do, also. And very quickly, having 
upperclassmen yelling at you and whatever, it

05:04.571 --> 05:14.787
really, it did, again, as I recall, high school, 
coming from a small high school, and in high school

05:15.273 --> 05:33.906
I was involved in everything, the student 
government, and in a sense were sort of a big man on

05:15.273 --> 05:33.906
campus, and all of a sudden you're this 
insignificant little nothing at A&M, along with

05:15.273 --> 05:33.906
all of your fellow members of your fish class. So I 
think that had a lot to do with it. I think I was not

05:36.352 --> 05:41.859
used to the yelling and screaming and the running 
in the middle of the night and the other stuff. And I

05:41.899 --> 05:50.191
think after about the first semester of my fish 
year, it got a little bit better, but not a lot. I can

05:50.671 --> 05:58.422
remember having many phone calls home and my 
parents coming in on the weekend because I just

05:50.671 --> 05:58.422
needed it to happen. But it was certainly a bonding 
experience with fellow members of the fish class.

06:04.700 --> 06:06.003
What about hazing? What events were there that 
today would be classified as hazing? Well, I think

06:10.933 --> 06:24.801
that stealing the CO's footlocker, which was a big 
tradition back then, and presenting it on

06:10.933 --> 06:24.801
Thanksgiving Day, there was a lot of hazing that 
went on to try to uncover where that footlocker did

06:25.051 --> 06:53.708
did y'all were you a party to that theft uh yes i was 
and where did y'all where how'd you get it and

06:25.051 --> 06:53.708
where'd you put it um you know what i don't even 
remember how we got it or where we all i i can't

06:25.051 --> 06:53.708
remember the fun parts all i can remember was 
sweating in the middle of the night and three

06:25.051 --> 06:53.708
o'clock in the morning doing um push-ups and stuff 
in the showers and everything else is the ceo

06:25.051 --> 06:53.708
acting very upset that we had taken his his um 
footlocker but probably secretly hoping that no

06:54.025 --> 07:01.494
one would crack so that his would be presented on 
the field on Thanksgiving Day. About how long in

07:01.514 --> 07:05.740
advance of that game was it? As I recall, it was 
about two weeks of hell. Two long weeks. And how

07:09.725 --> 07:13.149
many of you were involved in the theft? I think just 
about the whole fish class was involved. We all

07:16.313 --> 07:18.976
certainly paid the penalty for it. And I think the 
CO was involved. Secretly glad when at the end no

07:21.380 --> 07:24.764
one cracked me. What were some of the punishments? 
You said push-ups in the wee hours of the morning.

07:29.371 --> 07:31.033
Push-ups running first thing in the morning. It 
was one of the few times that all of a sudden the

07:31.113 --> 07:42.208
academic side of you, you're saying, we shouldn't 
be doing this because it's hurting our

07:31.113 --> 07:42.208
schoolwork. But had it not been the punishment 
that we were receiving, it probably wouldn't have

07:42.828 --> 07:47.775
been quite so concerning. How often was the board 
used? You know what, actually, by the time I was

07:51.456 --> 07:56.802
there, we didn't really have that. I can honestly 
say that the old grab poops and that part of it,

07:56.822 --> 08:04.009
there was very little of that. I think it was more 
just straight physical torture. Did you fish

08:09.095 --> 08:12.518
retaliate ever with some drown outs? A few, yes. 
Who were the favorite targets?

08:18.873 --> 08:30.409
Well, I think some of our

08:18.873 --> 08:30.409
sophomore

08:18.873 --> 08:30.409
leaders were the subject of those quite 
frequently. Then there was always the story that I

08:30.429 --> 08:37.919
don't know that it was a it ever happened, but it was 
certainly making the rounds when we were there.

08:39.341 --> 08:46.230
The upperclassmen

08:39.341 --> 08:46.230
who quite a few people didn't like that lived on the 
third or fourth floor of one of the dorms that

08:46.767 --> 09:12.825
supposedly they snuck in and recreated his room on 
the first floor secretly as he was sleeping and

08:46.767 --> 09:12.825
without waking him up put him on the first floor and 
then came in and made a mad show of getting ready to

08:46.767 --> 09:12.825
throw him out the window thinking that he was being 
thrown out of the third or fourth floor when in fact

08:46.767 --> 09:12.825
he was only in the first floor and they tossed him 
out the window i don't know if that was true or not

08:46.767 --> 09:12.825
but that was When I was there, that was a story that 
was going around that had happened. That it

09:17.905 --> 09:18.946
happened that year? Sometime in that time. Oh, 
really? Oh, that's good. That's a good Aggie

09:21.428 --> 09:22.469
story. Describe chow hall, a typical chow hall 
meal for a fish, your freshman year. You didn't get

09:34.060 --> 09:40.686
a lot to eat by the time you got through going 
through all the requests of the upperclassmen. as

09:41.392 --> 09:44.797
a fish, I don't recall eating very much at all. I can 
remember sneaking out on campus or spending a lot

09:44.937 --> 09:54.270
of times at the MSC eating because we didn't have a 
chance to eat a lot. In fact, I can remember my

09:54.290 --> 10:02.121
parents saying, how come you're spending so much 
money on food when your room and board is included

09:54.290 --> 10:02.121
in what we're paying? But I will say that by the time 
I got to be a sophomore, I put on about 20 pounds. I

10:08.049 --> 10:10.993
can remember chicken fried steak and lots of milk 
and make enough for not eating as a fish. What were

10:16.487 --> 10:19.310
your favorite Aggie foods, dining hall foods? 
Probably chicken fried steak. Lots of beef. Was

10:23.354 --> 10:25.316
there a nickname for chicken fried steak? I've not 
heard one. I don't think so. I don't recall. What

10:29.320 --> 10:31.442
was your least favorite? I don't recall I even had a 
least favorite. We had lots of beef though. What

10:34.825 --> 10:35.606
about desserts? Must have been some that you 
enjoyed. I

10:38.349 --> 10:41.672
don't remember. Let's see. Nicknames for 
beverages that were on the table. Tea.

10:55.054 --> 10:58.318
I don't know. Did anybody ever have lemonade? Did 
coffee have a nickname? I don't know. I think it was

11:02.424 --> 11:05.668
mostly just water, iced tea, and milk. Mostly 
milk. Describe beginning with whenever you got

11:08.748 --> 11:11.692
up. Run me through a typical day of classes, a 
Monday through Friday. What time did you get up and

11:17.939 --> 11:22.064
what did you do as a freshman? It seems like

11:22.084 --> 11:29.372
Reveille probably was around 6 o'clock. And I 
think we probably fell out about 6.30, 6.45 to

11:30.593 --> 11:35.419
march to breakfast. at Duncan. And then I think we 
were probably back at the dorm about 730. I

11:42.034 --> 11:47.239
remember shining a lot of shoes, using a lot of 
Brasso, getting everything ready. Then

11:48.260 --> 11:51.804
typically would, you know, go to morning classes. 
I think that probably there were a lot of lunches

11:54.046 --> 12:04.917
that I passed on just so I could avoid the midday 
hazing at the lunch table. I can remember taking

12:05.318 --> 12:08.441
lots and lots and lots of naps. It seems like we were 
back in my hole.

12:16.570 --> 12:21.755
And I think that probably the less visible you were 
in many cases, the better. It's probably good just

12:23.036 --> 12:28.602
to sort of slink in and slink out and not get hasty. 
Then afternoons, what happened? Afternoons

12:30.985 --> 12:33.607
actually, as I recall, was not bad. I mean, I know 
that there was— remember intramurals. And I can't

12:39.346 --> 12:43.930
remember how much intramurals happened as a fish 
and how much it was after that. But I remember that

12:43.990 --> 12:47.833
being actually an enjoyable part of the day. We did 
that and then usually seemed like we would get

12:47.853 --> 13:02.826
together then late in the afternoon and we'd march 
or do military type drills and stuff until we went

12:47.853 --> 13:02.826
in for the evening. And then you know, March to 
evening chow, and would come back, and they were

13:05.309 --> 13:10.695
pretty serious. Our outfit, again, because it was 
a General Moore outfit, was pretty serious about

13:10.715 --> 13:22.188
the grades, and being an engineering outfit, they 
took the academic side of it pretty seriously. And

13:22.208 --> 13:27.874
I can remember coming back, and we'd have study 
hall, and spending a good amount of time studying

13:22.208 --> 13:27.874
every night. All right, in terms of going to class, 
for you and your classmates, how often did y'all

13:28.816 --> 13:41.452
cut class as freshmen and sophomores? I would say a 
fair amount my freshman year, my sophomore year.

13:45.477 --> 13:49.041
For me personally, it was a lot. When you cut class, 
where'd you go? MSC? Oh, we'd go to the MSC, drink a

13:51.384 --> 13:54.688
lot of coffee. I can remember taking some 
afternoon drives, and I can't even remember quite

13:56.103 --> 14:02.810
where it was, but it was the place that you could 
drive to that you could actually buy liquor. And,

14:03.491 --> 14:05.934
you know, going and having a few beers in the 
afternoon. Nothing a lot, but just going out for a

14:05.954 --> 14:13.402
nice drive and, you know, picking up some beer and 
coming back. I remember that a lot. And

14:16.766 --> 14:25.215
having come from a

14:16.766 --> 14:25.215
high school that grades came pretty easily to me. 
And I thought that things were going to come pretty

14:30.564 --> 14:34.409
easily to me my first two years. And frankly, was 
probably not prepared as well as I should have and

14:35.029 --> 14:42.558
wasn't as serious about academics as I should 
have. So consequently, yes, we cut a lot of classes

14:42.618 --> 14:45.441
my sophomore year. My roommate then, which was a 
different roommate than my fish roommate, we were

14:45.742 --> 14:55.573
probably bad influences on each other because we 
were easily persuaded to go out and do something

14:45.742 --> 14:55.573
else. All right. Can you share with me whether you 
were involved or not? Can you share some jokes,

14:59.841 --> 15:07.028
pranks, good bull that you knew about during your 
student days? You mentioned moving the senior.

15:10.692 --> 15:11.313
That's a good one. A lot of drown us. And was that 
just dumping waste paper baskets, waste cans of

15:13.936 --> 15:17.780
water? Yeah, water.

15:21.544 --> 15:25.729
Yeah, taking them out to the quad and staking them 
out and drowning them out. We did quite a bit of

15:27.397 --> 15:34.025
that.

15:34.045 --> 15:34.165
Right. On whom were the pranks played? Why were 
they the targets? Well, when I was a fish was mostly

15:38.451 --> 15:42.276
on water with the seniors. All seniors or water the 
seniors? Yeah, we had in fact, our, our CEO, as I

15:45.399 --> 15:53.910
recall, had a girlfriend in Austin that We 
particularly liked getting a hold of him when his

15:54.785 --> 15:58.749
girlfriend was around and embarrassing him. That 
seemed to be where most of it occurred. Where would

16:04.954 --> 16:10.880
you, during all your A&M career, where would you 
all go for a good time on Saturday night? To

16:12.782 --> 16:15.004
Huntsville. I mean, really, we didn't spend that 
much time in College Station because I guess the

16:15.024 --> 16:21.550
Dixie Chicken came after I graduated. In fact, 
when we were in school, College Station was still a

16:24.468 --> 16:28.994
dry county, so we didn't do anything there. I can 
remember we'd have barbecues and things like

16:30.015 --> 16:35.823
that, but generally on the weekends, we would 
leave. And personally, having grown up on the

16:36.183 --> 16:47.218
Texas-Louisiana border, with the drinking age at 
that time being 18 in Louisiana, most of my buddies

16:36.183 --> 16:47.218
liked to come to my house

16:47.789 --> 17:17.188
right now you said Huntsville because there were 
more girls over there okay all right did y'all go to

16:47.789 --> 17:17.188
a whiskey bridge and buy alcohol yes

16:47.789 --> 17:17.188
but there wasn't a lot going on I mean back you know 
the 67 to 71 there weren't many girls on campus and

16:47.789 --> 17:17.188
so if you wanted dates you you had to go to 
Huntsville or go to Austin or go someplace else.

17:21.143 --> 17:29.288
And probably a lot of Saturday nights were just 
spent with the guys hanging out and playing poker

17:21.143 --> 17:29.288
or going to a movie or going to the Did y'all go, was 
it the sand pit, the rock pit? Earlier there was a

17:35.411 --> 17:49.156
place down the Welborn Road and west a half mile or 
so where there was a clay pit where there had been an

17:35.411 --> 17:49.156
all-male group would go down there and drink beer 
and skinny dip. That wasn't it. Who, during all of

17:51.340 --> 18:00.851
your years, who were the memorable for you, 
memorable teachers, advisors, counselors that

17:51.340 --> 18:00.851
you now realize were important to you? There were 
several. One of which, I don't remember his name,

18:03.735 --> 18:18.833
but, and

18:03.735 --> 18:18.833
this is kind of an interesting story, when after my 
sophomore year, after two years spent in

18:03.735 --> 18:18.833
engineering, My grades were such that they were,

18:19.387 --> 18:28.656
had been on scholastic probation. And it was 
really a lack of effort on my part in terms of not

18:28.676 --> 18:36.424
attending to my grades the way I should have. That 
after my sophomore year, it looked like there was a

18:36.444 --> 18:44.112
chance that I wasn't gonna be able to come back in 
the fall of my junior year. And one of my classes was

18:44.902 --> 19:02.627
a civil engineering class that I had just barely 
made a C. I was borderline between a C and a B, but

18:44.902 --> 19:02.627
ended up getting a C. And to ensure that I would be 
able to come back in the fall, I needed a B. And at the

19:03.608 --> 19:11.199
time, the instructor in that course, I believe his 
name was Lowry. He was a civil engineer. At the

19:12.861 --> 19:13.322
time, he was either a graduate student or early on. 
And I contacted him, and he said, I'll give you some

19:17.418 --> 19:25.751
extra work to do during the summer, and if you 
complete the work, then I'll change it right from C

19:17.418 --> 19:25.751
to B. And I completed the work, and he did, and I was 
able to stay in school. And about a year ago, I was

19:28.795 --> 19:43.697
looking at the Texas Aggie, and there was an 
article in there on professors that had been

19:28.795 --> 19:43.697
selected as whatever distinguished faculty 
members, and he was one of the The faculty members.

19:47.569 --> 19:48.931
That's what these watches are. Oh, is that what 
that is? Yeah. Do you know him? I remember him, yes.

19:53.240 --> 19:55.223
And my wife at the time was one of the things I 
probably regret. I probably still not too like to

19:55.243 --> 19:56.826
do it. But she said you should drop him a note to tell 
him. that he made a major role in you staying at A&M.

20:05.495 --> 20:13.527
Yeah, I would endorse her because those notes are 
touching to the person saying, okay, I did make a

20:05.495 --> 20:13.527
difference. Good. 28 years later, you made a huge 
difference. What about some others? Well, I had an

20:18.975 --> 20:26.866
economics professor who I would have to say was one 
of my favorite professors my whole four years at

20:18.975 --> 20:26.866
A&M. His name is Bill Graham. He was an outstanding 
professor. Describe what made him outstanding.

20:35.205 --> 20:36.467
He was a great storyteller. He made a relatively 
dry subject extremely interesting and described

20:36.527 --> 20:51.827
it in a way that made complex economic principles 
very easy to understand. He was always

20:51.847 --> 20:55.332
accessible, always willing to help you. And I say 
that well, long before he ever became well known as

20:56.442 --> 21:05.591
Senator of the state of Texas, but he was just a top 
notch professor. Another one of my favorites that

21:06.191 --> 21:16.301
made a difference was after my sophomore year, I 
changed to business, actually specialize in

21:06.191 --> 21:16.301
marketing. And there was a female instructor in 
the marketing department named Barbara Coe, who

21:16.321 --> 21:24.188
was just an excellent I think she's in North Texas

21:25.045 --> 21:29.330
now. Go ahead. And she made marketing extremely 
interesting, and to the extent that at the end of my

21:29.550 --> 21:49.371
sophomore year, I almost didn't make it to my 
junior year by the time that I was a senior, taking

21:29.550 --> 21:49.371
her courses, not because she was an easy grader, 
but because she finally tapped into me wanting to

21:29.550 --> 21:49.371
learn something. I actually made the dean's list, 
and I attribute a lot of that to her. To whom did you

21:53.986 --> 21:58.171
turn for academic advice during those years? At 
the end of my sophomore year, I turned to Dean

21:58.472 --> 22:15.033
Hubert, mostly because I knew he was from my 
hometown, and he knew my parents, and frankly, I

21:58.472 --> 22:15.033
was in need of some good advice as to what to do next. 
You remember, this would have been in the spring of

22:15.353 --> 22:22.002
69, which was not a good time not to be in school 
Vietnam War and he was very instrumental in

22:22.505 --> 22:51.246
helping me number one stay in school and number two 
being able to transfer out of engineering make

22:22.505 --> 22:51.246
believe that I didn't know him describe his manner 
and style of advising you as I recall

22:22.505 --> 22:51.246
as I recall he was a very courtly sort of person very 
understanding, not an easy guy. I mean, he very

22:57.890 --> 23:06.101
made me express my case very strongly as to why I 
needed to change why should be allowed to stay in

22:57.890 --> 23:06.101
school. But I think was understanding of the 
circumstances and was wanting to help out as long

23:06.682 --> 23:19.039
as I was willing to apply myself and try to get the 
direction of my academic record change. Were

23:19.863 --> 23:24.570
there, you've named a number, were there others, 
other faculty members and advisors? I would think

23:25.732 --> 23:29.658
those are the ones that really come to mind the 
most. All the professors in the business

23:29.678 --> 23:34.225
department were very good. Actually, Barbara 
Coe's husband, I think his name was Teddy Coe, he

23:34.766 --> 23:43.820
was the accounting professor, he was very good. 
There was a business professor I believe his name

23:48.145 --> 23:51.209
was Sam Hayes. He was also very, very good. The 
business department has some outstanding

23:53.452 --> 23:57.217
professors. What were the, in your day, what were 
the expected rules of classroom behavior?

24:04.766 --> 24:10.974
What did you think was expected of you while the 
class was going on? Well, I think most of them,

24:11.775 --> 24:17.022
particularly in my latter years, they very much 
wanted class participation. But I don't recall it

24:17.558 --> 24:21.123
being overly structured. I mean, I can remember 
taking a few catnaps in a lot of classes and no one

24:21.143 --> 24:27.572
ever running us out of class or anything. You know, 
I think that back, too, in the late 60s, A&M campus,

24:28.153 --> 24:46.840
as opposed to some of the other campuses, was still 
a very respectful, you know, we didn't have the

24:28.153 --> 24:46.840
riots or the demonstrations or the things that 
other, and I think we were very respectful of our

24:28.153 --> 24:46.840
teachers. Do you recall any kind of general sum of 
what it cost you to attend? I would have to guess it

24:55.475 --> 24:59.099
was probably a couple thousand dollars a year. And 
where did that money come from? Did you earn some?

25:02.042 --> 25:16.118
Well, I worked during the summers, every summer, 
and I was expected to earn my spending money, and

25:02.042 --> 25:16.118
then my parents paid for the tuition room and 
board, and in fact, my parents...

25:17.397 --> 25:37.110
insisted, and they probably could have afforded a 
little bit more, but they insisted that I do that,

25:17.397 --> 25:37.110
and then when my son went to college here five years 
ago, even though I could afford it to pay even more,

25:17.397 --> 25:37.110
I paid his room and board and insisted that he earn 
his spending money because I thought that was a

25:17.397 --> 25:37.110
good trade-off.

25:38.744 --> 26:06.304
let's see the MSC tell me about the the MSC and its 
role and what it represented to you and your fellow

25:38.744 --> 26:06.304
students it probably of any building on campus 
that had the most significance mainly as a meeting

25:38.744 --> 26:06.304
place we probably spent hours and hours and hours 
drinking coffee and smoking cigarettes and

25:38.744 --> 26:06.304
talking about everything in the world I mean that 
was I have wonderful, wonderful memories of the

26:07.702 --> 26:10.244
MSC. I mean, that was the place where everybody 
gathered and a lot of things took place. Any time

26:17.071 --> 26:24.077
between classes, rather than going back to the 
dorm, we almost always went over to the seat. I

26:24.097 --> 26:25.138
mean, that was the thing to do. And I always find it 
interesting that other campuses don't have a

26:25.158 --> 26:29.923
central gathering place like that. It's a very 
unique place. The fact that it is a memorial, I

26:32.085 --> 26:36.409
think, made it even more special. When I was at the 
Oklahoma State game a couple weeks ago, I took my

26:36.760 --> 26:41.925
wife around. I said, now, this is part of the 
original MSC, and this is where we used to drink

26:41.946 --> 26:49.413
coffee, and this is what we did, and showed her 
where the bowling alley used to be. Now, you are

26:49.473 --> 26:53.998
gone before the expansion. That's what I thought. 
Were you a member of any of the MSC activity groups?

27:03.909 --> 27:05.991
I participated in... Let's

27:07.388 --> 27:16.301
see. Were there any famous visitors to the campus 
during your era that you recall? Notable

27:23.712 --> 27:26.016
personalities. All right,

27:26.196 --> 27:33.006
Guyon Hall. What happened and what activities did 
you Which one was that? It was at the south end of

27:40.823 --> 27:42.546
Military Walk. Was it torn down before you? No, it 
was still there. That was the auditorium. But I

27:47.374 --> 27:51.241
don't remember what we did there. I don't have any 
recollection of that. Movies and chapel and

27:53.505 --> 27:56.750
lecture series and so forth. I mean, I can remember 
the name, and it seems like it was called one there,

27:57.251 --> 28:01.678
but I don't know. All right. Let's see, were you 
active in any of the religious events, religious

28:03.852 --> 28:10.379
organizations?

28:14.042 --> 28:14.783
Not active. We went to the Newman Club. Okay. In 
fact, all four of us, because we went to Catholic

28:16.565 --> 28:21.570
high school, were somewhat involved in that. 
Describe – I don't have any description of a Newman

28:21.610 --> 28:25.975
Club in that era in the file. Describe the Newman 
Club. You know, I don't think there was – I remember

28:29.198 --> 28:32.061
going to meetings, I can't even remember. Where 
did y'all meet? Over at St. Mary's? Over across the

28:35.605 --> 28:37.026
north side? Probably was, yeah. That's where we 
went to church. And you went to Mass there. About

28:42.112 --> 28:45.095
how many were present? What was a Mass like? There 
was, I think, a pretty good turn. I mean, I would say

28:48.859 --> 28:56.307
there were always, I would guess, hundreds of 
students that were there. Pretty well attended.

28:57.430 --> 29:10.246
Did you remember anything ever happening to you or 
that you knew of other that was at all

28:57.430 --> 29:10.246
inappropriate in relation to your being 
Catholic? No, not at all. I can honestly say I don't

29:11.087 --> 29:18.596
remember anything racial that ever happened. You 
know, for me, I'd never been around a lot of

29:18.616 --> 29:24.443
Hispanics. And that was always just very smooth, 
there was not any tension. We had, I don't recall,

29:31.403 --> 29:44.187
we didn't have a real high percentage of African 
Americans in the Corps, but I don't recall that

29:31.403 --> 29:44.187
there was any problems there with that. Were there 
any Jewish students that you knew of? Right

29:49.962 --> 29:58.218
now by your era the average student didn't get a 
nickname did they? So years and years earlier

29:59.460 --> 30:05.912
everybody had a nickname and one of the nicknames 
for Jewish students was Jew boy and but it was not a

30:05.892 --> 30:11.263
put-down, was not intended as such, and was not 
understood to be such. And if you were from

30:12.545 --> 30:19.760
Amarillo, you might have been sandy, because high 
school was the Amarillo Golden Sandstorm. And if

30:19.780 --> 30:23.327
you were short and wide, you might have been 
chunky. but these were identifying but those were

30:23.307 --> 30:40.827
gone by your era now did did you or any of your fellow 
Catholic students go over for advice and counsel

30:23.307 --> 30:40.827
at the Catholic Church of the Northgate And you 
didn't hear of any? No. All right. Let's see. Tell

30:45.556 --> 30:50.022
me about an Aggie football Saturday home game. 
That was one of the most fun things. What did you and

30:53.426 --> 30:55.949
your buddies do on a football weekend? Try to get a 
date for one thing, which was not always easy. A lot

31:01.375 --> 31:10.105
of my friends, if we didn't have a girlfriend at the 
time, that was around there, and again, I don't

31:10.540 --> 31:13.284
want many girls there. Probably early on, maybe 
the first two years I was there, mostly you brought

31:13.625 --> 31:33.257
girls from your hometown, and you had dates from, 
and they would drive up, in my case, drive up from

31:13.625 --> 31:33.257
Orange, or they'd drive up from Temple, or 
wherever they were from, and, um, we'd get

31:13.625 --> 31:33.257
together, usually they'd come in on a Friday 
afternoon, and, um,
