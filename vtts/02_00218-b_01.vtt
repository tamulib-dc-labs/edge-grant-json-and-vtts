WEBVTT

00:01.145 --> 00:06.392
Student life, and you were talking about Hector 
and Bill. Yeah, Bill Mahomes. What were the major

00:08.955 --> 00:13.280
extracurricular student organizations? MSC. 
With whatever it had to do, and that was pretty much

00:17.385 --> 00:21.490
it. Of course, you had intramurals. We were 
certainly all involved. Intramurals were a very

00:25.515 --> 00:28.819
important part of campus life. But it was... 
Regular school traditions, sporting

00:31.807 --> 00:37.434
activities, things of this nature in NIC. That was 
really it. You weren't not in the Singa Dads. No.

00:42.421 --> 00:49.250
All right, well, describe the routine of being a 
yell leader and particularly being a head yell

00:42.421 --> 00:49.250
leader. Oh, it was

00:49.270 --> 00:56.380
quite involved back in those days. I don't know, it 
was, as head yell leader you were, horse out front

01:01.709 --> 01:07.375
in charge of the Aggie spirit and things of this 
nature. But you had a hand in pretty much

01:07.395 --> 01:10.958
everything. Uh, Yelliers were in charge of 
building the bonfire. And as head Yellier you had

01:16.083 --> 01:18.866
to coordinate all that stuff. Now then that's left 
up to committees of folks to do that. Um, Muster,

01:25.233 --> 01:28.676
you were involved in Muster. You called the name of 
of the missing, and you were involved in that

01:30.498 --> 01:34.244
program. Started a school, all-university 
night. You were responsible for getting that all

01:36.287 --> 01:39.712
organized. You

01:39.792 --> 01:52.270
were pretty much critically involved in 
everything that took place on campus as Yellier,

01:39.792 --> 01:52.270
particularly head Yellier. You were involved 
with Student Senate, you were involved with MSC,

01:52.410 --> 01:59.661
you were involved with all those activities on the 
campus. And I would say that at that point in time,

02:00.282 --> 02:14.657
the three positions were core commander, student 
body president, head yell leader, and probably

02:00.282 --> 02:14.657
MSC president, four positions. And you four were 
responsible for pretty much everything that

02:14.677 --> 02:22.866
happened on campus in some form or fashion. Can you 
think of any specific incident, problem, event,

02:22.886 --> 02:29.833
et cetera, plus or minus, that you had to cope with 
as head yell leader? You mentioned one, the belt.

02:36.235 --> 02:40.221
The belt, that was the only, that was really the 
only thing that really stands out in my mind. I

02:41.563 --> 02:49.275
would say that being head yell leader was the most 
plushable thing that you could just about do at A&M

02:41.563 --> 02:49.275
in my opinion. It is the most high profile position 
there is. Everybody, I can tell you all my head yell

02:54.423 --> 02:57.408
leaders. I cannot begin to tell you. who the 
student body presidents were. I think I might can

03:01.464 --> 03:07.310
tell you who their core commanders were, but I have 
to think about that. But I can darn sure tell you who

03:07.330 --> 03:09.232
the head yell leader was. And he's known by 
everybody. Now, what did a head yell leader wear at

03:11.294 --> 03:15.479
a football game? They wore the whites, just like 
they do now. The same thing that Lupo gave us. Oh, I

03:21.365 --> 03:22.827
didn't know that. Oh, yeah. Lupo contributed to 
the yellier uniform, and he went over to the When

03:28.741 --> 03:39.993
you got lucky, you'd go over there and you'd find 
you some of those, they were basically the same

03:28.741 --> 03:39.993
uniforms that were used by the dairy employees, 
but they just put some patches and stuff on them,

03:28.741 --> 03:39.993
you know. And you'd go over there and they'd outfit 
you with a couple outfits and give them to you. They

03:45.960 --> 03:47.041
were yours. And

03:47.061 --> 03:54.589
they gave you the uniforms and the shoes and the 
whole bit, and that was it. Do you remember any

03:56.365 --> 03:59.949
particular games where the weather was extreme. 
Oh, yeah. I remember Florida State my junior year,

04:03.393 --> 04:12.823
just the torrential downpour, just 
unbelievable,

04:03.393 --> 04:12.823
rain fog. Cotton Bowl my junior year, it was so 
cotton and cold. And you're freezing to death. But

04:20.952 --> 04:24.516
nothing my senior year, there was anything 
weather standpoint or anything else that stands

04:24.968 --> 04:27.311
out. It was pretty much a calm deal. But the thing 
about the earlier I tell folks is after I got chosen

04:29.314 --> 04:42.250
as head dealer, I must have gotten cuter all of a 
sudden because my social life just took off. Girls

04:42.310 --> 04:45.735
I couldn't even begin to get to talk to were now 
calling me. It was a wonderful social experience

04:46.015 --> 04:51.482
at that point in time and a lot of fun. Describe 
midnight yell practice to someone who had never

04:51.682 --> 04:58.329
known about it. Well, midnight yell practice is a 
little different than it is now in that you did

04:58.349 --> 05:09.922
gather up in the quad, duck an area, and you took off 
and you followed the man all through campus. And we

05:11.404 --> 05:16.609
would go off the end of the quad and we'd go through, 
now it's the library. The library's there, so you

05:16.870 --> 05:18.111
can't do that. We'd go down there by the chemistry 
building, turn by the engineering buildings.

05:21.488 --> 05:33.659
We'd come around, pick up by Lysabesa, and come on 
over by the fish pond, the other dorms in Henderson

05:21.488 --> 05:33.659
Hall, and back on around by Simpson Drill Field, 
MSC, on in to the other. And we picked up students

05:33.679 --> 05:35.541
along the way. And by the time we got there, we had 
everybody swaying and arms locked and walking

05:36.422 --> 05:43.949
across the campus. It was a real affair. Then we got 
there, and everybody then got into sleep. Now

05:47.132 --> 05:47.592
then, A few follow the band over and everybody's in 
the study room ahead of time. It's not the same in

05:52.248 --> 05:55.130
that regard. Yale practices are a lot larger now 
than they were then because of the number of people

05:56.091 --> 06:01.095
involved. But they were fun experiences. They 
really truly were. Midnight Yale practice, you'd

06:05.899 --> 06:17.089
always have a date and usually had something you 
were going to beforehand, a dance or a party or

06:05.899 --> 06:17.089
something, and midnight Yale and all that went on 
there and then the next day of the game it was always

06:17.373 --> 06:43.549
a great place

06:17.373 --> 06:43.549
these are questions for earlier uh heroes uh going 
to and from college station you didn't have a car

06:17.373 --> 06:43.549
yeah uh you how did you get back and forth and how 
often Well, you went back and forth, you'd catch

06:44.407 --> 06:51.115
rides with folks from the same part of the country 
that you were from who might have a car, or you

06:44.407 --> 06:51.115
hitchhiked. And my record was 13 different rides 
from the campus of A&M to the front door of my

06:52.076 --> 06:59.805
parents' farm.

07:03.128 --> 07:06.853
Which I don't want to spend most of the day on those 
13 rides to get there. But most of the times you'd

07:07.473 --> 07:12.439
ride with some, you got to know everybody from your 
part of the country. And one of the stories I'm told

07:13.128 --> 07:26.109
here recently is there was one guy in Atlanta named 
Danny Barr that I would ride with, and a couple kids

07:13.128 --> 07:26.109
from Pittsburgh that I'd ride with, too. And I 
remember Danny just didn't ride with him too much

07:27.371 --> 07:32.378
because he drove like a mangy gang. I mean, he would 
just scare the hell out of me. What's so funny about

07:36.184 --> 07:40.992
all that stuff is that Danny Barr just retired from 
the Air Force. For the last, I think, about 10 years

07:41.714 --> 07:46.020
of his career, he was a pilot of Air Force One. And I 
thought, my God, as a president, how bad a driver he

07:46.040 --> 07:51.367
used to be. But now he's flying the president 
around in response for his safety. But I just catch

07:54.551 --> 07:57.756
rides with guys going back home. And it was not a 
problem. And we'd go quite often. When there

08:03.003 --> 08:09.612
wasn't something happening on campus, 
particularly when you're a freshman or

08:03.003 --> 08:09.612
sophomore, you want to kind of get out of harm's 
way. And that was what you did to do that. I told, I

08:13.835 --> 08:16.478
gave a speech to some of the kids a few years ago. 
They wanted to end the semester type of thing. I

08:19.682 --> 08:22.005
wanted to kind of pump them up to come back. I told 
them, I said, I think that if I were to ever have an

08:22.846 --> 08:37.084
accident and be in a coma, and I could be in a coma for 
certain months only, and if I would wake up on a

08:22.846 --> 08:37.084
Sunday afternoon, I would know it would be a Sunday 
afternoon. because I had this sinking feeling in

08:37.807 --> 08:45.577
the pit of my stomach that you got on Sunday after 
you had to go back to the dorm, all on land, because

08:37.807 --> 08:45.577
that's exactly right. That's the same feeling you 
got. What were the secrets of Aggie hitchhiking?

08:50.504 --> 09:00.457
You had your little bag that said Texas Aggies on 
it, this little tote bag, and the uniform helped.

09:01.819 --> 09:07.206
And I never will forget, I was dropped off in 
Jewett, Texas, And 79 was one of the main routes

09:08.047 --> 09:11.752
back to northeast Texas. And I was back on the north 
side of Jewett, and I had my bag down, my uniform in.

09:18.561 --> 09:22.947
Here comes this car with this convertible, two 
young ladies in it. And they were blowing down the

09:22.967 --> 09:28.634
highway, and I pull on the brakes and think, it's 
some distance from me. And I pick my bag, and I run

09:28.654 --> 09:30.337
down there. And I thought, oh, man, my luck has 
turned. It's a convertible with two young ladies

09:32.019 --> 09:35.804
in it, you know, the whole bit. And Just about the 
time I get there, they take off. And there were a

09:39.147 --> 09:42.211
couple girls from University of Texas. They made 
some comment about Aggies and drove off into the

09:43.352 --> 09:48.518
sunset. I remember picking up a rock and wanting to 
chuck it at them, but I didn't. Let's see. You

09:55.906 --> 09:57.488
didn't have a car for a while. No, I did not. Were 
there any rules about borrowing cars? Sure. The

10:06.704 --> 10:13.172
rule was, you put the gas in, you bring it back, and 
if there's any dents in it, you're responsible for

10:06.704 --> 10:13.172
it. We had two freshmen that had cars when we were 
freshmen, and we all utilized those cars.

10:23.103 --> 10:33.235
By the time, you know, you got to be juniors and 
seniors, a lot of the guys had vehicles at that

10:23.103 --> 10:33.235
point in time, and you always had an opportunity to 
get around when they went. My mother's car, I got to

10:33.856 --> 10:35.738
use it. But as far as my own car, I didn't get one 
until I was about to graduate, to tell you the

10:35.838 --> 10:42.165
truth. And I really didn't need it. Didn't need to 
have a vehicle involved. I had friends and

10:45.809 --> 10:47.991
obviously cars and stuff. And it was not a problem 
to get around.

10:53.638 --> 10:57.482
Women were beginning to enroll at A&M. Describe 
getting a date, meeting a young lady, How did a

11:03.320 --> 11:05.402
young man accomplish that? Well, you had to be kind 
of careful, because the pretty girls most often

11:05.422 --> 11:10.969
were married to the guys who were already here on 
campus. You had to be careful who you were flirting

11:11.610 --> 11:14.493
with, because it might be her husband right behind 
you.

11:17.477 --> 11:23.203
I think that in my freshman class, I think there 
were like about 400 girls. I think we had like

11:23.223 --> 11:28.810
about, I don't know, it was like 2,000 or 3,000 
folks. And so that's the girls. A lot of them were

11:30.572 --> 11:33.175
professors, daughters, and things of this 
nature. local girls,

11:33.543 --> 11:44.600
you did kind of get to know the ones that were single 
and things of this nature. And the problem was, as

11:45.441 --> 11:53.834
freshmen you didn't get a chance to really get to 
date them because the upperclassmen did. And by

11:53.854 --> 12:00.664
the time I graduated, the population of the school 
had risen to like 12,000 and And there were a lot

12:01.302 --> 12:04.586
more girls on campus then. Still, the main 
criteria was that most of them were married. But

12:08.830 --> 12:09.711
there were more girls. But at that point in time, 
you still had that contact with other schools. And

12:15.077 --> 12:21.404
on weekends, there were just a carload of girls 
coming in on campus. Now, where did they stay? Oh,

12:23.466 --> 12:30.634
they would stay at families, homes, or whatever 
motel facilities that you could find. in front of

12:30.935 --> 12:31.416
mine. Were there any TASIC visitors? Oh yeah, 
there were a lot of girls from TWU would come in. But

12:38.485 --> 12:50.001
primarily at that point in time, it was Baylor 
girls, Houston girls, TU girls. You'd find

12:52.325 --> 12:59.895
carloads of girls coming in from campuses that, 
you know, one has a boyfriend and she's bringing

12:52.325 --> 12:59.895
four or five other girls. Dates with his friends, 
you know, that type of deal. I've heard about beast

13:04.053 --> 13:06.697
buckets and moose pox. Oh, yeah, I know those 
things too. Oh, boy, I was hoping you could

13:11.303 --> 13:13.666
understand. What were the major events, dances, 
and other social events for which one would hope to

13:14.267 --> 13:20.015
have a date? All the major things that you had, 
certainly you wanted bonfire. We had the

13:24.841 --> 13:26.704
different balls. We had the class balls that you 
would have. You'd have a combat ball. You'd have a

13:31.008 --> 13:32.690
military weekend ball. You had things like junior 
year, you'd get a big dance. You had senior, ring

13:37.235 --> 13:40.159
dance your senior year. Those were things you 
certainly had dates for, plus the football games.

13:43.663 --> 13:46.506
And those big dances were held where? They were 
held in the MSC, primarily, or Sabisa. And how did

13:50.051 --> 13:51.492
one dress? You were in uniform, dress uniform, 
pretty much always. As a matter of fact, my wife, I

13:55.715 --> 14:02.185
had a date with her from boot dance in my junior 
year. That was our first date. Describe how you

14:05.429 --> 14:07.312
happened to meet her. My brother, you get set up 
with these sisters, and I had a sister dumped on me a

14:07.973 --> 14:23.015
time or two, and I was pretty reluctant to take out 
sisters because I thought, well, this guy doesn't

14:07.973 --> 14:23.015
look any better than he does. What is a sister going 
to look like, you know, that type of deal. I had a

14:25.938 --> 14:30.822
friend of mine that was from Northeast Texas also 
that was classed behind me. And he came up one day

14:30.843 --> 14:34.366
and said, my sister's coming down. He said, you 
might like to go out with her. I said, oh, God, Gary,

14:37.348 --> 14:40.091
I've had the sister routine, you know. He said, no, 
I got pictures. And so I went. I said, I don't want to

14:42.393 --> 14:43.254
see them. So I went. And she was going to East Texas 
State at the time. She was a university beauty and

14:46.957 --> 14:53.143
all that kind of stuff up there with all these 
fraternity sweethearts. and really involved on

14:53.782 --> 14:57.588
her campus. So I said, sure. And so we had our date 
then and

14:58.970 --> 15:07.743
didn't follow up. Well, I can point to it, but she 
was dating another guy in high school that she'd

15:07.963 --> 15:12.390
gone with for a long time. Anyway, my senior year 
after football season was over with, I ran into

15:13.291 --> 15:19.180
Gary again and asked if his sister was married. And 
he says, no, they broke up. And I said, well.

15:22.992 --> 15:26.297
reintroduce myself, and we ended up getting 
married about 40 years later. So, that happened

15:27.178 --> 15:28.901
quite often. You would get set up with blind dates. 
Blind dates were old. That happened quite a bit.

15:38.014 --> 15:46.567
Where were the off-limit places that an A&M 
student might have gone during that era? Well,

15:47.268 --> 15:51.574
there were certain bars and stuff, particularly 
in Bryan, that you kind of watched out for. What

15:51.674 --> 15:52.155
were they? Oh, the Hitchin' Puffs, the Longhorn 
was another one. If you wanted your manhood

15:57.964 --> 16:02.191
tested, you could get tested pretty quickly if you 
were so of mind to. Nezzy's was another one I recall

16:02.852 --> 16:10.385
that was kind of one of those places that you might 
best watch your P's and Q's. We also had a problem at

16:11.587 --> 16:18.278
that point in time with the local kids.

16:18.882 --> 16:23.847
college kids were here in town, and they were the 
local girls that you would date and things of that

16:18.882 --> 16:23.847
nature. Some of the local high school boys or 
others took offense at that, and from time to time

16:23.867 --> 16:34.658
if you were in an unfavorable situation, you could 
get jumped. And I know that that did happen from

16:35.399 --> 16:38.682
time to time. The old KC Ballroom downtown had a lot 
of dances and stuff. If you went with a local girl,

16:47.149 --> 16:50.472
you had to be pretty careful. You might get 
somebody to try to rearrange your nose for you,

16:51.093 --> 16:55.298
stuff like that. Where did a student go to get 
alcoholic beverage? Well, you could get beer from

17:01.164 --> 17:04.728
a lot of places around. But you couldn't. You had to 
go across the bridge over to McPherson County,

17:06.770 --> 17:10.855
across Whiskey Bridge, it was called. It's on 
Highway 60 here. That was the first liquor store

17:12.356 --> 17:13.898
there. Anybody had to make a liquor run, you had to 
go to Whiskey Bridge to do that. It was always a

17:17.525 --> 17:22.049
crowded place on Friday afternoons for home 
football weekends or Saturdays. As a young Aggie

17:23.130 --> 17:40.647
and not being 21, they'd have a lot of beer busts and 
stuff down the river or whatever that they provide

17:23.130 --> 17:40.647
for you. But we'd, as you'd try to find places, we'd 
go over to Snook and Brenham area, because over in

17:45.350 --> 17:53.962
those communities, they weren't so particular 
about age limits. And kids grew up over there,

17:55.344 --> 17:59.170
physical dances and drinking beer. But I happened 
to be 21, so we'd go over there. Alright, if someone

18:03.876 --> 18:09.744
went to Whiskey Bridge and brought a bottle back, 
did they dare take it in the dorm? No. Where did it

18:10.443 --> 18:12.125
get stored? It stayed in the trunk of the car until 
wherever you were going to go and have your party or

18:12.225 --> 18:17.932
function or whatever it might be. That was 
something that just didn't happen in the dorms.

18:20.315 --> 18:22.017
There wasn't any drinking in the dorms. It really 
wasn't. That was, I saw a lot of people who drunk

18:23.098 --> 18:35.493
that came into the dorm, but I really truly can't 
say that I saw any drinking taking place in the

18:23.098 --> 18:35.493
dorms. Describe the community around the campus, 
Northgate, Eastgate, Southgate, what was there?

18:42.221 --> 18:43.802
Well, College Station was not much. It was a few 
blocks off of what's now George Bush Drive. It was

18:50.649 --> 18:52.991
that side. It went a little further on the east 
side, Walton Drive, back over that area. The

19:01.379 --> 19:05.643
Northgate area was the only business district 
that there was in town. What businesses were

19:05.763 --> 19:06.764
there? Oh, you had basically the bookstores and 
you had Uh, Waldrop's, which was a men's store. Uh,

19:17.116 --> 19:19.158
you had Mr. Hollick's, a good shop. Uh, you had 
Cleaner's. Uh, you had Charlie's Grocery. Uh, Lou

19:25.905 --> 19:29.068
Ed's Restaurant. Uh, you had the theater, the 
campus theater. Uh, and that was it. That was the

19:32.412 --> 19:34.194
business district. That fellow that ran that 
place on the corner that sold a lot of things.

19:38.918 --> 19:39.799
Describe him. That was a drug store. That's right. 
It was a drug store there. And Lupo's was down now

19:43.932 --> 19:48.077
and basically where the Dixie Chicken is. 
Describe Lou. Oh, curious, outgoing, you know.

19:55.387 --> 19:58.211
Once you saw Lupo, he was always the same. He

19:59.113 --> 20:03.699
did a lot of things for folks. Of course, he was a 
businessman, and he was out to get students'

20:03.739 --> 20:09.567
involvement in his story and things of this 
nature. But he did a lot of things for folks that

20:09.935 --> 20:13.240
never knew about it. And I'll give one story. Of 
course, when you're doing this, well, come on back

20:15.543 --> 20:18.888
here, good eggs, you know. And he greeted 
everybody, good egg, you know. It was, hey, good

20:21.772 --> 20:23.435
egg, how you doing? Or, hey, fighter. You know, I 
don't know. That was always his greeting to you.

20:27.260 --> 20:30.725
And he always greeted you like he was your 
long-lost friend, whatever. And he didn't know

20:30.885 --> 20:33.189
you from that end, but that was OK. I remember one 
time, one of the guys in the outfit Younger brother

20:39.247 --> 20:50.737
came to campus to visit, and he came in with another 
friend of his on like a Friday, and his folks were

20:39.247 --> 20:50.737
coming in Saturday from the football game. Well, 
they ended up in trouble and ended up in jail that

20:50.758 --> 20:54.401
night. And so we're trying to figure out how we can 
get him out of jail. We don't have enough money

20:57.984 --> 21:00.226
between all of us to get him out of jail. I can't get 
him bailed out. Parents will be here the next day,

21:02.208 --> 21:06.672
and brother will say, oh, man, if my folks don't 
know what just happened, they'll kill me, you

21:02.208 --> 21:06.672
know. I said, we're going to have that money. Who do 
we know that has that kind of money? Lupo's the only

21:10.976 --> 21:12.617
one that has that kind of money. I said, let's call 
him. And it was like 2.33 o'clock in the morning. I

21:18.102 --> 21:18.543
call him. He gets up, puts on his pants, goes down, 
and tells the kid out of jail. I thought, now that's

21:23.147 --> 21:25.429
great. That really is. We paid him back. No problem 
with that. Total stranger. But he was nagging. I

21:32.636 --> 21:34.317
told him the circumstances. He said, sir, you bet, 
son. I might be doing it. And he did. But he was a

21:37.567 --> 21:40.171
character. But he was loved by folks. He was who he 
was. Off-campus events. What major national or

21:47.721 --> 21:55.492
worldwide events do you remember that occurred 
while you were here as a student? Oh, I remember all

21:55.512 --> 22:03.623
the marches and the riots and things of this nature 
that took place. The unrest. that was existing

22:07.368 --> 22:11.512
elsewhere but here. It was like we were insulating 
that stuff here. But this is the peace movement,

22:14.936 --> 22:37.020
and I remember the Democratic Convention of 68, 
that summer, the riots in Chicago, the Black

22:14.936 --> 22:37.020
Panthers,

22:14.936 --> 22:37.020
all those things that went on and were just timed in 
our country that I thought, man, where are we going

22:14.936 --> 22:37.020
as a nation? because it was so different than the 
way Westmont was growing up. All of a sudden, in

22:44.397 --> 22:50.743
about a four year time period there, society 
changed, big time. From being segregated, old

22:50.763 --> 22:58.932
South, God country, my mouth fired, God country to 
being something that's hard to recognize. And it

22:59.492 --> 23:01.875
happened very quickly. It was a very tumultuous 
time in our country and our lives. And I saw it in the

23:08.067 --> 23:10.030
distance. I didn't really anticipate that stuff. 
What did you and your friends think about Vietnam

23:12.113 --> 23:19.343
and its effect on you? Most of us were, you know, of 
the opinion, it happens, it happens. It's

23:27.675 --> 23:29.899
something that you're supposed to do. That sense 
of duty, I guess. My family was always that kind of

23:36.637 --> 23:37.838
sense. My father fought in World War II. His father 
fought in World War I. I think if somebody in my

23:40.260 --> 23:46.826
family served in every war in our country, they had 
to serve in the Spanish-American War. And it was

23:46.846 --> 23:48.467
your time and your generation. You just did it, 
period. And so it was, that was kind of the attitude

23:50.609 --> 23:57.355
that we had. And I'll tell you, earlier in my 
career, people were more gung-ho about the

23:57.375 --> 24:02.540
military than they were at the end of it. At the end 
of it, you had all these

24:07.552 --> 24:11.275
about what they were really doing. And of course, 
you have some hesitancy, too, about the

24:11.355 --> 24:16.840
situation. But I know that most of us did serve, and 
most of us, a lot of us did feel good. Was there an

24:21.385 --> 24:26.669
impact on dorm and or corps life from Vietnam? Were 
there veterans that were on corps staff or in the

24:26.689 --> 24:33.436
trigon or anything? There were some. We never got 
into this military peace movement conflict type

24:36.492 --> 24:46.365
of deal at all on this campus when I was here. I know 
that there were a lot of unrest on the campuses. The

24:49.869 --> 24:54.575
Kent State killing and all the riots that took 
place. I think General Rudder had it. How many

24:56.517 --> 24:58.220
demonstrations do you remember here? Zero. I was 
told there was some folks coming over from Austin

25:00.082 --> 25:04.828
one time, but they never made it to campus. The only 
demonstration, I think, that ever occurred on

25:06.732 --> 25:16.627
campus occurred before I got here, and that was in 
Marsden President's home about the food, quality

25:06.732 --> 25:16.627
of the food. There was nothing like that ever on 
that campus. And like I said, we were kind of

25:20.693 --> 25:24.098
insulating that stuff in that regard. And I was 
kind of glad. But you'd see it on TV and things of

25:25.079 --> 25:27.523
this nature, and you'd say, man. Let's see. 
Student indulgences. There were some beer and

25:30.687 --> 25:32.210
whiskey. Tobacco? Yes, tobacco. And I will just 
tell you that I never, ever saw the use of any

25:37.175 --> 25:44.303
narcotics in any shape or fashion. Did you even 
know the words? No. I didn't know what all the slang

25:47.647 --> 25:50.630
words were. You know, those are good stuff. And 
marijuana, until I got in the military, I did not

25:52.292 --> 26:00.281
even know what it looked like, smelled like, or 
anything else. I flew this in that regard. We had

26:03.464 --> 26:06.608
kind of a pristine environment here, too, truly. I 
never, like I said, I never saw those things until I

26:07.651 --> 26:13.698
got off the circus. Describe a court trip. Oh, it 
was helter-skelter, catch as catch can, get

26:16.801 --> 26:36.122
there, get there, pile into somebody's home, 
sleep on the floors, wherever you could, and mom

26:16.801 --> 26:36.122
and dad trying everything they could to keep 
everybody fed and happy, and it was a great time.

26:38.841 --> 26:44.908
Then the game, March in, and the game and the 
parties and stuff, it was always a fun trip. Always

26:44.928 --> 26:46.510
a great trip. I look forward to court trips. Do you 
remember any specific high or low point on a court

26:47.771 --> 26:52.617
trip? Oh, I remember a court trip my freshman year 
before, and we all, whoever lived in that area had

26:52.998 --> 27:03.510
to put up with all the classmates. And we had a 
couple of guys from the area, so we were able to buy

27:03.946 --> 27:09.433
that, buy two or three guys from the area. And we had 
a great time, and we go to the game, and we play TCU.

27:15.281 --> 27:16.903
And we're successful. The game was on the call. And 
one thing I remember is we were leaving, and I

27:18.525 --> 27:21.088
didn't have dates. We were just up there with the 
guys that one time. And we had a senior, or there was

27:24.052 --> 27:31.442
a senior, that got jumped by some pledges from one 
of the attorneys at TCU. There were about 20 of

27:31.462 --> 27:33.885
those guys there. He jumped in on his date and tried 
to take his boots off. And I recall he started

27:37.333 --> 27:40.737
hollering, old army fight. And so now the chant 
gets up, old army fight. And everybody starts

27:43.280 --> 27:47.205
talking about, well, next thing you know, we have 
about 300 of us, and there's about 20 of them. So the

27:48.166 --> 27:51.891
eyes turned about the same way in our favor then. 
And they decided being in that fraternity was not,

27:52.131 --> 28:01.282
and that task they were given was not what they 
should be doing, and be the retreat, so to speak.

28:01.302 --> 28:02.944
But that was the thing. And the others are always 
fun, too. We always had a great time. We enjoyed it.

28:10.263 --> 28:14.247
Our senior year, we took a senior trip as we got to 
Saline. And we were on chartered buses and stuff as

28:14.267 --> 28:18.030
seniors when we were down there. We had New 
Orleans, and it was great. It was fun. Describe a

28:23.015 --> 28:25.838
typical football day in College Station. Most of 
the games were day games. And so a typical day was

28:28.681 --> 28:32.965
that you would get up and start getting your 
uniform and stuff together that morning. You

28:38.579 --> 28:41.402
don't go to chow or anything like that, march to 
chow usually. But you would have a formation

28:42.764 --> 28:46.348
before you go to the game because you would do the 
marching. And date, parents and stuff would come

28:47.149 --> 28:50.533
to the dorm. You usually had a mom. Back in those 
days, you bought a mom for your date, your mom,

28:51.574 --> 28:55.319
whoever. All the women wore moms. There were 
people on the side of the road selling moms to

28:56.420 --> 29:01.406
everybody going to the game. And you would March 
over, go to the game. It was always exciting. It was

29:06.036 --> 29:07.699
always a grand time on campus. We only had the one 
level at Kyle Field. They started building the

29:11.705 --> 29:16.352
second level my senior year. But they didn't have 
it. We just had it until the year after I graduated.

29:20.639 --> 29:22.803
So we just had the one level at Kyle Field. It was 
always pretty much well attended. There might be a

29:26.188 --> 29:28.772
few seats in the horseshoe sometimes that weren't 
used. But most of the time, it was full. and it was a

29:31.484 --> 29:33.626
great moment. Victory celebrations, what were 
they? Well, carrying the Yeliers off the field,

29:37.290 --> 29:42.376
carrying the football team off the field. We 
didn't have too many of those, so I thought we won

29:43.257 --> 29:53.128
one game my freshman year, and that was Gene 
Stallings' first year.

29:55.190 --> 30:00.276
It was more of a sense of family and closeness and 
environment Then I think now the kids on the

30:00.914 --> 30:07.924
football team were isolated. They were part of the 
campus, and everybody knew them, and they knew a

30:09.006 --> 30:12.912
lot of those folks. A lot more interaction, I 
thought, between the athletes than there is now.

30:17.599 --> 30:20.182
What was your favorite football game memory? 
Victory. Oh, from a victory standpoint, it would

30:22.606 --> 30:29.436
have to be the 10-0 win, like you knew you were going 
to beat Texas here. win a conference

30:29.804 --> 30:32.527
championship. Or the second most would be the 
Texas Tech victory out at Tech, where we had our

30:32.547 --> 30:43.880
score with no time left on the block to win that 
game, which was the start of the run, which was a

30:32.547 --> 30:43.880
great deal. One of the stories I tell about the Tech 
game is, we're out there with, we had dates with

30:43.900 --> 30:56.875
Tech girls and stuff, and we're staying at this 
apartment with one of his high school buddies who

30:43.900 --> 30:56.875
went to Tech. And we had great girls for a date, 
pretty girls, and we had a lot of fun. We go to the

31:03.384 --> 31:07.670
game, and they're intrigued by all this Aggie 
stuff. It's a great game. We win the end of the game.

31:11.456 --> 31:13.619
And we're going to go back to the apartment. We're 
going to celebrate a little bit. And I remember

31:15.822 --> 31:16.804
walking back. There was like four of us. We had our 
uniforms on. And we had these dates. Here comes

31:21.571 --> 31:23.794
this freshman. He was in a uniform, his core 
uniform. got one of those bells from those saddle

31:28.090 --> 31:32.468
tramps that got him. And here's about 50 guys in red 
shirts and black pants just right behind him. And

31:35.822 --> 31:37.830
he's running to beat the thing in.
