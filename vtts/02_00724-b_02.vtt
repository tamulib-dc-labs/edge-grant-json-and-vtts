00:11.962 --> 00:23.540
We were just talking about you and Mr. Spence had 
divided the responsibilities in that he did the

00:11.962 --> 00:23.540
new construction and you did the renovation and 
maintenance. And at what point was it that you

00:23.620 --> 00:28.708
separated departments then? During the tenure of 
Dr. Morgan, Dr. Morgan had started trying to get

00:39.029 --> 00:46.340
all of these college activities together and get 
them separated from the system, I guess. There

00:46.420 --> 01:08.412
were a lot of them, and I was the only hanger-on, I 
believe, in the college down in the system

00:46.420 --> 01:08.412
administration building, and we just built this 
building for a physical plant over there, and

00:46.420 --> 01:08.412
although it wasn't intended at the time, I might 
have had to taking a little stiffer hand in

01:08.763 --> 01:14.892
southern planning if they had, I moved over there 
and set up And we were entirely separated. So Mr.

01:18.631 --> 01:23.019
Spence then was with the system. He was a manager of 
physical plant for the system. His job was

01:25.883 --> 01:31.552
planning and construction for the entire system, 
including the university. And you were then just

01:32.914 --> 01:35.238
for Texas A&M. Right. The operation and 
maintenance of the university. So there is no

01:42.614 --> 01:49.964
college, in a sense, college architect or 
university architect anymore. It's all a systems

01:50.365 --> 01:52.307
architect. That's right. Right now, Mr. Elkins is 
system architect. And he does? The system handles

01:59.077 --> 02:05.846
all, except minor projects, which the physical 
plant will handle. Usually not new construction,

02:05.866 --> 02:10.933
but alterations and some smaller things. I think 
they have authority up to $10,000, I believe. That

02:14.849 --> 02:21.852
is the college buildings and utilities, or 
university buildings and utilities up to

02:14.849 --> 02:21.852
$10,000. I've had a little bit of experience 
working with the architect's office in the

02:22.203 --> 02:31.055
renovation of the Cushing building where the 
archives will be moving later on. The system

02:31.075 --> 02:34.300
architect's office did all of that. The system 
physical plans office under Adam was the director

02:34.560 --> 02:44.134
of facilities planning and construction.

02:49.401 --> 02:52.125
Let me back up a little bit. and ask you a question 
pertaining to a later period. I asked you the same

02:57.230 --> 02:58.512
question earlier. That is about student 
laborers. You mentioned that in the construction

03:03.477 --> 03:10.945
part, you didn't regularly, did not generally or 
could not generally use student laborers in

03:03.477 --> 03:10.945
construction. This was in the pre-World War II 
days, which you had a lot of students in building

03:12.147 --> 03:20.796
maintenance, I mean, or janitorial. work. Did you 
continue that pretty much after the war when you

03:22.349 --> 03:26.143
came back? No, it had been discontinued I guess 
during the war because You see, at one stage during

03:32.116 --> 03:38.406
the war A&M had a relatively small student body. 
Now they did have a number of military units here,

03:39.006 --> 03:56.072
what was it, student training that the government 
sent here and they were, I don't remember what it

03:39.006 --> 03:56.072
was, ASTP.

03:56.093 --> 03:57.735
Some activity, where the armed forces had great 
consistency. They even had, I believe, most of the

04:03.458 --> 04:09.546
12 dominoes occupied by the Navy. And basically,

04:09.566 --> 04:19.099
full students were the rather low ebb at that time. 
And if they hadn't had the Army and the Navy and the

04:20.301 --> 04:25.528
Air Force here going to school, And they used, of 
course, many of the instructors for things that

04:26.673 --> 04:31.158
fitted in. Once you take like the old, what was the 
old PMA building for years, down where the tennis

04:32.300 --> 04:44.695
courts in that area. Now the Navy operated an 
electronics school there training Naval

04:52.340 --> 04:54.743
personnel, electronics, and such. You used the 
term PMA building, which stands for what?

04:57.547 --> 04:59.209
Production Management. It's a forerunner of AAA, 
and then whatever they call it now. USDA? No, USDA

05:04.857 --> 05:10.444
activity down there, giving people stuff for not 
planting stuff and all that. OK. It was a big, they

05:11.906 --> 05:21.098
had hundreds of employees down there in that 
thing, back in the early Roosevelt days.

05:24.790 --> 05:36.240
After the war, one of the things I

05:24.790 --> 05:36.240
had some activity in was disposing of old 
buildings. You know, we mentioned the Aggieland

05:36.260 --> 05:38.082
Inn. I sold that to a firm in Austin and demolished 
it, hauled it off. We had Austin, two of the early

05:45.328 --> 05:50.413
dormitories, Austin and Pfeiffer Halls. They 
stuck around until post-World War II. Yeah. Old

05:55.891 --> 06:01.137
Austin Hall was one of the, I believe, not the only 
building that sat square with the world. It faced

06:02.239 --> 06:23.805
the south, which in the early days of the college, 
the road came up the old main drive from the

06:02.239 --> 06:23.805
railroad station and post office and made a circle 
around and back, and it happened to be on the circle

06:02.239 --> 06:23.805
where it sat, north and south and east and west.

06:25.810 --> 06:50.265
Also, there was Ross

06:25.810 --> 06:50.265
Hall, which we all have been for a long time, was 
the, originally a dormitory, sold that, and what

06:25.810 --> 06:50.265
was the name of the, building over right across 
from the Koch building now, and that went over to

06:51.916 --> 07:02.267
Foster, Foster Hall, and sold that. And then of 
course we had the job of getting rid of most of the

07:03.508 --> 07:12.677
houses on the campus then, starting with the group 
where the student center was built. We had to clear

07:12.717 --> 07:18.143
that site in order to start construction there. 
And they gradually disappeared to where we don't

07:19.152 --> 07:25.321
even have any over here on the Candy Hill. It used to 
be called years ago. Candy Hill? How'd you get that

07:30.429 --> 07:31.911
name? Lord, I don't know it was called that when I 
came here. I don't know where it came from. That

07:36.158 --> 07:38.862
would be in the area of what, say, across from here. 
These last dormitories, up on this corner that's

07:38.882 --> 07:46.273
vacant, right up, well, you know they were. When 
you came in, there was still a few employees'

07:46.675 --> 07:56.327
houses along the intersection of the Boulevard de 
Bryan, the extension of College Road. Across the

07:56.347 --> 07:58.209
street, down from the engineering building. 
Yeah, diagonally across from Zachary Hall.

08:01.934 --> 08:05.278
Across what used to be the circles, now it's the 
squares. Well, I believe somewhere over there is

08:05.298 --> 08:08.382
where Doc Asbury lived. Yes. Well, originally, he 
lived down here where the post office is, just back

08:09.543 --> 08:16.412
to the post office. And he was quite a character. 
And in fact, you have some of his Asbury Room in

08:21.517 --> 08:24.982
Cushing Library. I don't know whether it's still 
called that or not. But he donated his records and

08:26.905 --> 08:35.717
books on opera and painting reproductions and 
things. But when the post office built, see, we

08:35.737 --> 08:44.209
gave that, I don't know, acre to the land, deeded it 
to the post office department of the US post office

08:35.737 --> 08:44.209
there. And we had to move a railroad. Well, the 
railroad had to be moved for construction of

08:48.623 --> 08:52.328
Walton Hall. It went down in front of Walton Hall 
down the side of Speza because all the grocers were

08:52.448 --> 09:18.023
brought in on the train and went on down to the power 
plant

08:52.448 --> 09:18.023
to unload the coal, the lignite, and then on down 
back on what is now the petroleum building and what

08:52.448 --> 09:18.023
used to be Petroleum Geology, the one that had the 
tower on it. Well, with the cattle pens, the stock

09:19.201 --> 09:22.544
came out. Then that siding was moved and built 
Walton Hall. And then it had to be rerouted again to

09:25.987 --> 09:38.999
make room for the four dormitories to come around 
and come up outside the post office, just north of

09:25.987 --> 09:38.999
the post office, and then back into those places. 
Of course, in 1927

09:39.740 --> 09:47.807
or 1928, we converted to gas and quit hauling in 
lignite.

09:51.179 --> 09:53.101
shovel coal down there a few nights. Is that while 
you were a student? Yeah. Shoveling off of the

09:56.945 --> 09:59.568
train car, or? No, out of the bins into the boilers. 
Of course, you had to travel the thing, but you had

10:05.373 --> 10:08.777
to shovel.

10:15.524 --> 10:20.629
Doing a little bit of looking in our biographical 
file on you, indicated that you had been on the

10:22.145 --> 10:27.191
College Station City Council from 46 to 53. I 
served three terms on the City Council, soon after

10:27.471 --> 10:33.278
the war. What years were they? 46 to 53. That would 
have been right after you returned, I think. I

10:38.263 --> 10:46.633
think Tom Harrington was on that time, and I 
believe when he terminated and didn't run again, I

10:38.263 --> 10:46.633
believe that I took his place on the council. There 
was no problem serving on the city council? No,

10:54.471 --> 11:07.623
except always that thing hung over us because we 
had two or three threats of suit for actions. I

11:07.763 --> 11:16.030
remember one, there was a gentleman who raised 
chickens, which was against the city ordinance,

11:16.516 --> 11:24.974
and he was directed to dispose of them, and he was 
threatened to sue us once to bring that up, but

11:16.516 --> 11:24.974
didn't. Ernest Langford was mayor at the time, in 
fact for quite a long while, and one or two others,

11:25.074 --> 11:37.140
but they never did culminate in a suit.

11:45.355 --> 11:52.265
Let's see, I guess now it would be possible to serve 
on the city council and also- Yes, I have a few

11:45.355 --> 11:52.265
that's on the city council. Because of the recent- 
I would imagine those years when you were on the

11:52.605 --> 12:05.543
city council would have been one of a fair amount of 
growth of the city of College Station, would it

11:52.605 --> 12:05.543
not? We had lots of problems of that sort because I 
have a unique situation at College Station that

12:12.220 --> 12:23.150
was particularly more dominant in the early days 
because the community grew up around the

12:12.220 --> 12:23.150
periphery of the campus.

12:25.732 --> 12:39.645
This tended to multiply or aggravate some of your 
problems because it wasn't a compact unit like

12:25.732 --> 12:39.645
Bryan grew out of a certain area in the beginning 
and expanded from that. go around and of course

12:40.672 --> 12:54.449
there was very little commercial businesses of 
many sorts out here and particularly streets and

12:40.672 --> 12:54.449
utilities became a problem because they were 
strung out.

13:01.438 --> 13:03.841
It's a different place now. It's a different place 
than it was three years ago when I came. My wife and I

13:09.578 --> 13:18.790
married at 19 and 30, that's a year after I 
completed my graduate work. I was working at the

13:18.810 --> 13:20.833
University of New York College. We couldn't get a 
place out of the counter station because there

13:22.816 --> 13:26.441
weren't very, very few. Most of them were down here 
in what I told you is College Park. And so we had to

13:32.489 --> 13:37.155
rent an apartment in Bryan. That seemed like an 
awful long ways for me to go. I'd try to go home for

13:41.142 --> 13:47.049
lunch, you know, and all. At that point was the old 
Tuneville Trolley still in operation?

13:53.277 --> 14:03.109
No, they had been discontinued and a taxi cab 
company had taken over. I think it's the one that

14:04.338 --> 14:13.570
seemed like one of the operators of the, in urban, 
ran the original Taxi Service Twin College in

14:04.338 --> 14:13.570
Bryan. But I know, I'd learned in my association 
with Ernest Langford that he was designing a

14:15.433 --> 14:24.745
couple of little matchbox duplexes. Well, some, 
the professor and his wife were down in College

14:25.507 --> 14:28.771
Park.

14:31.555 --> 14:34.058
My wife and I rented that apartment while he was 
working on the plans in order to get one to get out of

14:34.493 --> 14:38.457
college. It was

14:40.038 --> 14:48.246
not much bigger than your secretary's office in 
this room together, I guess. Small bedroom,

14:49.707 --> 14:55.593
bathroom, kitchenette, and small living room. 
I'd be rather happy to get it. Even at that, though,

14:57.795 --> 15:04.281
it was a little bit more than the marriage students 
had when they came to Leavitt Park Hall. There were

15:04.717 --> 15:09.603
very few Merritt students before the war. Of 
course, they were growing more mostly in the

15:09.863 --> 15:15.911
graduate area. But there were a few. I remember 
one, Raymond Rogers, who was retired and lives

15:16.912 --> 15:22.439
down here south of campus. When he came back the 
second time to go to A&M,

15:30.316 --> 15:36.103
He rented what had been the maids' quarters, I 
believe, over Dr. Marsh's house. You see, in those

15:36.123 --> 15:46.917
early days, most of the campus houses had a little 
outhouse back behind the house where the maids

15:36.123 --> 15:46.917
lived. And later on, as it began to get a little more 
prosperous and the land students got greater and

15:46.937 --> 15:58.551
the maids didn't live in anymore, They rendered 
them out to students.
