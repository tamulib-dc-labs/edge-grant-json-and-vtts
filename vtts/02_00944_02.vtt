WEBVTT

00:01.567 --> 00:08.253
With Christie and capital improvements, the city 
stopped trying to put them through in about, what,

00:01.567 --> 00:08.253
74, 75? Oh, I don't know. That may not be really 
quite right. We used to have it very specific.

00:13.218 --> 00:14.619
First, it was a five-year plan. Then we made a 
six-year plan. And then we made it three years

00:15.961 --> 00:19.124
specific and three years general. For capital 
improvements in the city? Yeah. I think the three

00:21.426 --> 00:25.890
years specific and the three years general is 
probably more practical than the five-year plan.

00:26.931 --> 00:31.135
And then we started to just have an intense capital 
improvement program. At the same time, we were

00:31.469 --> 00:34.012
planning to have a bond issue. And we were having 
bond issues every three to five years. And so

00:36.976 --> 00:41.801
really every three years, I guess, over the last 
decade or so. So the cattle improvement program

00:41.821 --> 00:47.749
was really honed down and got specific around that 
bond issue. So this was the next three years and

00:47.769 --> 00:52.634
then beyond without any kind of time frame. So we 
didn't get involved with all this business about

00:52.654 --> 00:58.962
trying to get people's expectations up for the 
fourth and fifth and sixth years. when you had no

00:59.347 --> 01:03.052
idea what reality might be at that time. I'll never 
forget one project called Caroline. Remember

01:05.155 --> 01:06.677
Caroline? Right, yeah. Caroline was scheduled 
for improvements in 1958 on one of these listed

01:07.878 --> 01:17.010
capital improvements. And I had to suffer with 
that from 1958 until I guess Caroline was finally

01:17.651 --> 01:22.938
paid. And

01:22.958 --> 01:27.244
it's all paid now. I think so. I mean, I remember 
part of it being paved in the mid-'60s when I used to

01:28.484 --> 01:35.551
go out in that area of town. Mid-'60s? Seems like it 
was mid-'60s. Well, I was driving by 65 or 66, so.

01:43.920 --> 01:44.380
I've forgotten. I think Carolina was paved in the 
70s, the part that I'm talking about. I mean,

01:47.083 --> 01:48.645
completely paved out. Yeah, curb and gutter and 
sidewalk and all. Yeah. But 15 years, whatever it

01:52.349 --> 01:55.712
was, 20 years later, And yet, the reason was it 
shouldn't have been put there in the first place.

02:02.198 --> 02:06.505
Carol Lane, I mean, it shouldn't have been on the 
capital improvement program in the first place.

02:06.525 --> 02:07.506
Was it too early? Yeah, in terms of priorities. In 
fact, I don't know that it was in their best

02:10.050 --> 02:13.495
interest to have it paved when it was paved. 
Because Carol Lane was sitting there with its

02:14.437 --> 02:19.264
residential nature pretty well preserved. It 
didn't have to happen what happened to Earhart. It

02:22.729 --> 02:24.872
was still residential in nature. Well, who was 
setting up those priorities for the... The usual

02:28.382 --> 02:29.224
staff. At that time it was headed by planning and it 
was backed up by public works and engineering.

02:38.179 --> 02:43.427
But there's no way to set priorities like that and 
make sense out of them that far ahead of time. If you

02:45.150 --> 02:47.434
think about planning and

02:50.924 --> 02:55.191
We've been fighting here, our sewer planning. We 
had a very optimistic plan submitted three years

02:55.211 --> 02:59.437
ago before Peso collapsed. And the city was 
growing it very rapidly. But we're having to eat

03:03.363 --> 03:07.029
that plan now because this involves the state and 
the EPA and everybody. And they want us to prove

03:08.051 --> 03:11.656
that our new growth forecasts are correct. Well, 
I'll tell you right now, there's nobody in this

03:13.339 --> 03:17.185
town who can forecast more than three months ahead 
of time right now. We don't know where the city's

03:18.177 --> 03:21.982
going next year, next five years. We don't know the 
next three months. Look at the major economic

03:24.806 --> 03:33.157
activities that have happened in South Texas over 
the last 20 years and ask yourself how many of them

03:24.806 --> 03:33.157
were forecasted. Almost no one forecasted what 
was going to happen to the price of natural gas.

03:38.284 --> 03:40.187
Next to nobody. Even though everybody had a kind of 
vague feeling about the peso going down, nobody

03:40.207 --> 03:46.075
forecasted even to the year. Or to the extent. Or to 
the extent, right.

03:52.216 --> 03:59.883
Nobody really forecasted the impact of the 
problems with foreign oil. You can identify

03:59.903 --> 04:08.592
almost every really major impact on South Texas, 
and it wasn't anybody's plan. And so that doesn't

04:08.612 --> 04:14.138
mean we shouldn't plan, because we need to have the 
plan set forth. But we've got to recognize that

04:14.253 --> 04:20.480
those places where the plan tends to get stuck and 
rigid have to be avoided. And that's what the

04:21.562 --> 04:25.246
capital improvement program process was doing. 
You get people who had no idea what was going to

04:25.266 --> 04:29.972
happen six years from now trying to forecast six 
years hence. Well, it's nice to forecast the

04:31.333 --> 04:33.956
things you have a fairly good idea about. You can 
come pretty close to forecasting such values, I

04:34.957 --> 04:37.761
think. And you can relate that to the consumption 
of land. If we grow 2,000 people a year or for six

04:41.658 --> 04:46.324
years, that's 12,000 people. And the average 
family size is three plus, whatever it is. And that

04:50.229 --> 04:53.033
equates to 4,000 families. And 4,000 families 
equates to, we'll say, 700 acres or 600 acres of

04:53.834 --> 04:59.362
land. So it's reasonable. When we look at the whole 
city and we say, well, we think this guy's going to

05:00.523 --> 05:04.949
be able to put up a 40-acre development here. This 
is going to happen over here. And we've got sewer

05:06.431 --> 05:08.594
service here and water service here. Yeah, we can 
take care of 700 families this way and that way.

05:11.476 --> 05:20.052
That's good planning, as long as you realize that 
it needs to stay that flexible, that you obviously

05:11.476 --> 05:20.052
covered a whole bunch of assumptions there. Now 
for us to start getting specific and saying in the

05:21.154 --> 05:35.239
fourth year, we're going to build this road, 
because there are going to be 200 or more houses out

05:21.154 --> 05:35.239
here, all of a sudden it's starting to get awfully 
fuzzy, because those 200 houses may come first,

05:21.154 --> 05:35.239
they may come last. Now, if we have a good reason why 
they might come first, that's something else.

05:38.149 --> 05:43.676
Let's say there's a big ministry going down the 
street from them, and yes, that makes sense that

05:38.149 --> 05:43.676
that's going to be the hottest area. Well, then 
maybe we can show that as a priority street in the

05:43.996 --> 05:46.860
first year. But it sure gets weak by the fifth year, 
and the sixth year, and the seventh year. I think

05:51.365 --> 05:53.087
somebody's tried the 10-year program. That's 
just wild. To me, if you can't show how you're going

05:56.211 --> 06:04.281
to pay for it, then you probably aren't going to get 
the quality of decision-making that you need from

05:56.211 --> 06:04.281
them. first-level planner, to the city manager, 
to the city council, to the planning commission. I

06:09.316 --> 06:22.227
watch so many planning commissions sit down with 
the capital improvement program and say, well,

06:09.316 --> 06:22.227
what's the bond election going to be, and where's 
the money coming from, and for all the stuff that

06:09.316 --> 06:22.227
the money's not set for, they just don't even read 
it. And all of a sudden, that becomes the approved

06:23.468 --> 06:25.430
program. Somebody says, when's my street going to 
be paved? Oh, well, you're set down in the fifth

06:27.952 --> 06:31.796
year, ma'am. And what level of decision would you 
do it? Some low staff person scheduled it. And

06:37.699 --> 06:40.702
everybody else was too busy worrying about these 
first three years to even look at this fifth year.

06:41.623 --> 06:43.605
And all of a sudden, a whole bunch of false 
expectations. People saying, ah, my storm

06:43.625 --> 06:46.348
steward's in the fifth year. That's 1987. I can 
count on that. So you're saying that anything

06:49.532 --> 06:51.874
after three years. Well, after the time that you 
can pay for it. Because you don't get the decision

06:55.138 --> 07:01.605
making process doesn't work unless you've got to 
pay for what your dreams are. All you're doing is

07:03.104 --> 07:04.846
listing projects. We had a project in Corpus 
Christi that made it into four or five capital

07:05.287 --> 07:11.135
improvement programs. And it was for the birds. I 
feel guilty as much as anybody else. I didn't

07:14.160 --> 07:15.902
really think of it and thought through well 
enough. But still, I knew it was representing a

07:16.563 --> 07:19.507
problem. Six points. Why? You know, six points 
back in the late 50s was just a traffic nightmare

07:22.171 --> 07:28.039
before the Crosstown Expressway opened up. 
Terrible, you know. If you had to go to work through

07:29.682 --> 07:32.706
six points, you added 10 minutes time to that 
thing. So our people came up with a fancy plan to go

07:34.525 --> 07:47.323
around Six Points, bypass around Six Points, and 
then to parallel 6th and 7th, I think it was, it may

07:34.525 --> 07:47.323
have been 5th and, no, it may have been 7th, I think 
it was 5th, 6th and 7th Street. By Spahn Hospital?

07:48.124 --> 07:48.345
Yeah. Right, yeah. Well, this side of Spahn 
Hospital, I say this side, you know, between Spahn

07:49.126 --> 07:53.071
and Six Points. Yeah, between Spahn and Six 
Points. To parallel those and to come down, and

07:55.074 --> 08:00.482
also to cut... The Del Mar 3rd connection, right 
through that block there by Spahn Hospital, right

08:00.783 --> 08:11.808
through all those houses, so that you can make that 
transition smoothly without having to go and make

08:00.783 --> 08:11.808
a right-hand turn, a left-hand turn. Dumb 
recommendation, that one. That's one of the

08:13.071 --> 08:14.033
dumbest. I didn't know a person in the city that's 
ever been hurt by having to turn down Del Mar and

08:14.468 --> 08:22.759
then make a left-hand turn versus being able to 
merge in across those fine houses. I think it only

08:22.779 --> 08:27.526
takes about six or seven of those houses out in 
order to make that a smooth transition. What does a

08:28.407 --> 08:29.709
smooth transition do? In fact, it makes the 
traffic a little slower to make them have to make a

08:29.749 --> 08:35.136
right-hand turn than a left-hand turn. But 
anyway, this was grandiose and crazy. I mean, it

08:40.363 --> 08:41.505
was going to be expensive. It involved putting 
some parking lots in Six Points and buying all that

08:42.245 --> 08:46.430
property. And it involved making Alameda become 
Staples. And Staples became, let's see.

09:00.885 --> 09:07.813
Anyway, I guess going south, Staples continued to 
be Staples and Alameda No, Alameda, that's right.

09:10.453 --> 09:13.056
Alameda became Staples, and Staples became 
Alameda. Alameda was over there by the Six Points

09:13.096 --> 09:15.579
Theater. And in essence, it left the Six Points 
area as Staples. Alameda came in, and it went north

09:20.085 --> 09:24.010
as Staples. Great project if money was no object, 
and if somebody had some redevelopment plans to go

09:25.572 --> 09:30.938
with it. But it was a transportation planner's 
project. The truth of the matter is, the property

09:35.103 --> 09:37.446
owners didn't really agree. There was no money for 
the parking lots. And if you moved all the traffic

09:43.093 --> 09:46.077
around it, you'd probably kill six points. You 
didn't have that much capacity to come back. The

09:49.642 --> 09:54.769
economic activity around it wasn't sufficient to 
make that a really desirable location. So what we

09:54.789 --> 10:04.682
would have probably done is simply kill what was 
there and spend millions of dollars on this cotton

09:54.789 --> 10:04.682
picking way around the circle. A few years later, 
some relatively simple traffic signal

10:04.848 --> 10:13.639
improvements were made, and the drainage 
problems were corrected, and the streets were

10:04.848 --> 10:13.639
paying better. And I don't think anybody today 
would recommend that grandiose plan of Six

10:14.721 --> 10:19.107
Points. It economically didn't make any sense. 
You're spending so much money for the few stores

10:21.830 --> 10:27.037
that were left, and in the process, isolating 
those stores from their own customers. And Six

10:28.619 --> 10:34.146
Points, actually, one of its biggest customers is 
its walk-in traffic from the older neighborhood

10:34.514 --> 10:36.636
out toward Delmar. And by doing this, she made it 
almost impossible for the person to walk there to

10:36.656 --> 10:41.901
get there. So how was that plan defeated then? It 
just died in the planning department? No, no, no.

10:47.826 --> 10:52.450
Well, I mean, first of all, it just got kicked out of 
capital improvement programs. But the point I'm

10:53.231 --> 10:55.453
making is for two or three years, it was in there. 
People were saying, hey, this is a scheduled

10:56.313 --> 10:58.055
project. Why isn't it on the next bond election? 
And it never really was thought through well. It

11:03.600 --> 11:03.880
was a transportation planner's solution that 
never had to stand the test of reality of going

11:04.315 --> 11:21.210
through the whole process of other departments 
giving and taking and the planning commission

11:04.315 --> 11:21.210
criticism and the honest ending cost estimates as 
to what it was going to cost. Because it was in the

11:22.492 --> 11:25.454
plan and not in the real program. And that to me just 
almost forces the current planning process to be

11:26.836 --> 11:31.740
tied to a real program where the planner and the 
operator have to make it happen. Like how much

11:36.365 --> 11:39.069
community development money are you going to have 
in the next three years? That's real. What's the

11:41.212 --> 11:43.415
opportunity to get federal funds through the 
highway department? That's real. The bond issue?

11:45.478 --> 11:46.500
That's real. And the Corpus Christi had to have an 
election for every bond issue. Now, those are real

11:49.484 --> 11:50.405
things. If you're going to have to raise the money, 
then you've really put the project through the

11:50.425 --> 11:55.112
ringer. And when it comes out, you're willing to 
pay for it. But the rest of it. You just kind of say,

12:00.087 --> 12:02.890
well, we'll show it as bond issues. We'll show 
we're going to have $5 million this year, $6

12:02.930 --> 12:08.176
million next, $7 million, $8 million, $9 million, 
$10 million, $11 million. We're going to finance

12:08.196 --> 12:09.417
it like so. We're going to sell as many revenue 
bonds as we need. So we'll sell a bunch of sewerage

12:11.059 --> 12:12.921
bonds to the sewer plants. Just very rarely do you 
see a capital improvement program when they

12:13.822 --> 12:25.655
really say that in the fifth year, it's going to 
require a 75% sewer rate increase, or it's going to

12:13.822 --> 12:25.655
require taxes or less than so. They just address 
the first part of the plan. Well, I appreciate you

12:30.395 --> 12:36.844
going into that, and I thank you very much for your 
time. Is that really what you need? Well, it's

12:38.986 --> 12:58.933
given me a lot of good information, and I think 
about the growth of Corpus Christi, and perhaps

12:38.986 --> 12:58.933
it's

12:38.986 --> 12:58.933
a... Everyone has their own particular point of 
view, and if we're going to look at how planning has

12:38.986 --> 12:58.933
affected the growth of a city... We'd like to get 
the points of view of a group of people who are

12:59.690 --> 13:08.663
involved in the growth, not just one person, not 
just one department at one specific time. I feel

13:10.046 --> 13:13.050
very strongly about protecting the Bayfront. I do 
too. I'm not so sure it's being protected right

13:13.571 --> 13:16.836
now. That's one reason I'm down here and not over 
there. development of the bayfront and the beach,

13:20.125 --> 13:23.690
for that matter. The beach is going to be one of the 
long, low condominiums. Block to block, you're

13:27.876 --> 13:29.759
not going to be able to hit that peak. If you're not 
in the first half of the block, you're not even

13:29.779 --> 13:34.486
going to be able to see it before approaching the 
beach. You'll probably notice the star of the

13:34.506 --> 13:36.969
condominiums. And they're so eager to get 
commercial uses on the bayfront that it's just

13:37.210 --> 13:41.196
killing them. Who is that? Well, it was the last 
council. which literally is the reason I'm not

13:45.218 --> 13:47.441
there. Is it a mixture of council, Chamber of 
Commerce? Oh, not so much Chamber of Commerce.

13:53.650 --> 13:59.898
Maybe it's been council, which has been 
controlled by developers, and they've just been

13:53.650 --> 13:59.898
so gung-ho to make things happen on that paper.

14:04.345 --> 14:13.217
Mayor Pro Tem said to me one day over a cocktail that 
if I push the paper on development projects, that

14:04.345 --> 14:13.217
she'd be with me 100%, and if I wouldn't, she was 
going to get me. That's how important it was to her.

14:18.345 --> 14:20.789
And I never really have understood exactly why. Of 
course, most of that council was in the

14:20.829 --> 14:23.132
development business. There were people who 
either their hobby or who had direct livelihood

14:24.174 --> 14:35.170
was construction, condominiums, 
semi-condominiums, that kind of thing. I'm not

14:35.190 --> 14:36.673
saying that the projects are all bad. There have 
been some nice projects. But that cocktail bar

14:39.497 --> 14:44.284
marina office, have you been along the background 
recently? Uh, well, yeah. Yeah, I have. Well, you

14:47.538 --> 14:53.345
may not have noticed it yet, but on the middle 
teahead, where the Marine Office used to be,

14:47.538 --> 14:53.345
Lawrence Street Teahead? Right. The Marine 
Office was taken out with Hurricane Allen, and

14:54.707 --> 15:08.584
they, with a private-public participation 
cooperation project, they put back a new Marine

14:54.707 --> 15:08.584
Office, but it's got a big cocktail-inch grill on 
top of it. And it just stands up like an elephant out

15:09.003 --> 15:16.170
there in the water. But I hope they don't do too much 
of that. But they've been pushing this bill. And I

15:22.116 --> 15:26.721
don't know whether you keep up with the discussion 
or not. Yeah, I do. All of a sudden, a couple weeks

15:27.322 --> 15:32.487
ago, there was this amazing discovery that there 
was going to be a problem with B zones. I don't know

15:33.588 --> 15:35.750
if you're familiar with B zones or not. But in the 
floodplain area. Right. Is that something to do

15:38.791 --> 15:40.513
with insurance? Yeah, a federal insurance 
program. But if the city agrees to clean it,

15:41.974 --> 15:44.177
they've got to comply with all the rules. And you 
can't build below the floodplain. Well, on the

15:47.220 --> 15:52.206
Gulf side, there's what's called a velocity zone 
on top of it, a V-zone. And they're saying now that

15:52.226 --> 15:55.890
this is brand new information to them. Well, a 
V-zone presentation was made as a factor after

15:55.910 --> 16:00.355
Hurricane Alan. And that was 1980, OK. All of a 
sudden, there's news, news about the V-Zone. How

16:07.727 --> 16:10.513
that's going to cause the landfill problem. I just 
laughed up my sleeve. Everybody knew. It was in the

16:13.979 --> 16:14.881
papers, even. The fact that, see, that's one of the 
reasons why it took so long to repair some of the

16:16.684 --> 16:27.424
stuff after Hurricane Allen, was the feds were 
saying that the improvements are going to have to

16:16.684 --> 16:27.424
be consistent with the V-Zone calculations.

16:28.822 --> 16:31.786
Well, the hotels are happening. I guess I didn't 
mention that. That was always a major concern, is

16:33.288 --> 16:37.994
that we have hotels that support the convention 
center. And I felt very confident that it happened

16:38.014 --> 16:40.999
as soon as the interest rates dropped. Remember, 
when the convention center was finished, the

16:41.019 --> 16:46.867
interest rates were way up in the 16th, 17th, 18th 
percent period. And it was obvious to most of us

16:46.887 --> 16:56.820
that when the interest rates dropped, that part 
would take care of itself and get Marriott and

16:46.887 --> 16:56.820
Treasury Harbor House and the... That's why it's 
been on the beach and two of the others have built

16:57.442 --> 17:03.394
this in the last couple of years. It certainly has 
changed the look of downtown Corpus Christi quite

17:03.414 --> 17:12.352
a bit. Well, thank you. I really appreciate your 
time. You're welcome. Good luck to you.
