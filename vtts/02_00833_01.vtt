00:04.300 --> 00:05.963
We're not worried about that. Just trying to find 
out a little bit. Listen, Jackson, you mentioned

00:09.569 --> 00:13.716
earlier that your son went to Allen Academy. And 
then went to A&M. And then went to A&M. Could you

00:16.661 --> 00:18.844
tell us something about the education system? Has 
it changed very much from the time that your son

00:18.905 --> 00:23.472
went to school to now? Odella, I'm not sure I could 
help you at that point. Because I just... When he

00:31.165 --> 00:35.671
went to Allen Academy, see, that was the military 
too. And that helped him a lot to go to A&M. In fact,

00:39.457 --> 00:44.864
he was next to the best freshman, real freshman on 
the campus. And it just made him sick that he walked

00:45.445 --> 00:49.791
through the vest, stood up all afternoon. But he 
said, brother, my thumb just got so it wouldn't

00:50.011 --> 00:52.695
work. He stood up. But he was strictly military. 
But I don't know how that thing's run now. See, I

00:59.856 --> 01:04.482
can't make that comparison because I just don't 
have any connection with it now. I have access to

01:04.502 --> 01:08.567
it, but it really just doesn't go places by itself. 
I could go to anything on the campus, but as far as

01:08.647 --> 01:15.256
having access to it. But I don't go because you just 
don't go alone. And I can't make that comparison. I

01:22.525 --> 01:23.046
just don't know how. I don't think they're near as 
strict as they used to be. Well, what was the reason

01:27.663 --> 01:32.490
for Allen Academy to be out there in the first 
place? Do you have any idea? Well, they were for

01:34.293 --> 01:43.666
younger boys, boys from wealthy homes and broken 
homes and things like that. The parents just felt

01:43.906 --> 01:47.211
like they wanted them in a private school. A lot of 
them were able to send them. Others, you hate to say

01:49.434 --> 01:53.400
it, but they were from broken homes. We sent 
Clarkie there because Mr. Allen was a Methodist,

01:53.752 --> 02:10.109
and he,

01:53.752 --> 02:10.109
well, he just did a lot for the Methodist boys, just 
out of the goodness of his heart. We never could

02:10.149 --> 02:16.515
have sent him there because it was an exclusive 
school and a very good school, a very good school.

02:17.176 --> 02:22.982
And a lot of the parents sent them there because it 
was kind of a preparatory school for, you know,

02:17.176 --> 02:22.982
from high school. to college is a pretty big jump, 
you see. And that was a junior college. It was a step

02:29.050 --> 02:33.856
between high school, and then Allen Academy, and 
then college. It's an awful big jump from high

02:34.536 --> 02:36.979
school to college. I don't know how a lot of them 
ever make it. I'm a firm believer in a junior

02:41.725 --> 02:43.887
college. And that's what it was. And they weren't 
there. Because so many of these little old

02:47.532 --> 02:52.918
freshmen come here that right out of high school, 
they just can't make it. It's too big a jump. And as I

02:55.897 --> 03:08.891
say, a lot of people sent them for that preparatory 
work for college, and others sent them because

02:55.897 --> 03:08.891
they were from broken homes, and they didn't 
mortgage a small amount. They had to send them

03:08.911 --> 03:12.715
somewhere, those that were left with their 
mothers. You see, their mothers had to get work or

03:12.936 --> 03:16.259
something like that. It's the only child you give 
your mother. But it was a very good school. Do you

03:20.440 --> 03:24.945
think maybe some of the inflow that came in had 
something to do with Allen Academy? People coming

03:25.966 --> 03:29.470
in from, say, the surrounding towns? Yes, I think 
it did. I think it did. Not as much so as the other

03:34.776 --> 03:36.879
class, I don't believe. Because I'll tell you why. 
The high schools here were good. The people that

03:40.743 --> 03:46.750
came here to make their homes here, you see, sent 
them to high school. to the high schools in Bryan.

03:49.615 --> 03:50.677
Then you have one out here. That's why I said, look, 
Clarkie took two years at the high school in Bryan

03:51.318 --> 03:58.647
before he went to Allen County. He did go to the high 
school in Bryan two years, and then he wanted to go

03:59.248 --> 04:07.018
to Allen County, and Mr. Allen wanted him there. He 
had a very fine school soul. That's when he

04:09.521 --> 04:11.343
switched. And then that kind of got him ready for 
A&M. But

04:16.058 --> 04:24.469
I think the Bryan High School has always been a good 
high school. And I think the people that live in

04:24.489 --> 04:34.141
Bryan, I don't think they felt the necessity of it, 
you see, because they had a good school there. They

04:34.161 --> 04:35.642
had excellent teachers. It's always been a good 
high school. Now I think A&M kind of. Matches wits

04:41.793 --> 04:42.975
with them. But we didn't even have a high school. 
And now don't they have three or four at A&M?

04:47.941 --> 04:49.023
Several, I understand. I don't know how many 
elementary schools they have. But the kids on the

04:51.546 --> 04:54.310
campus didn't even have a place to go. Those 
professors' children, they met in a little frame

04:54.871 --> 05:01.680
building over there. And I think they did have good 
teachers, but they didn't have anything to work

05:02.241 --> 05:07.028
with. The teachers were the professors' wives, 
you see. And most of those professors married old

05:10.835 --> 05:15.062
maid school teachers. And they were smart, but 
they didn't know anything about kids. You know, it

05:18.327 --> 05:20.891
takes an old maid to tell you how to raise kids. You 
only have the one child in the house? That's the

05:28.323 --> 05:31.087
one. But Bob, he makes up for a dozen. Does he live 
here in Bryan? No, he doesn't. He lives in Houston.

05:37.237 --> 05:37.838
He lives in Houston.

05:40.889 --> 05:42.711
But he was an Aggie from here to there. And I am, too. 
There's not much of me, but it's all Aggies. But did

05:50.482 --> 05:57.271
the college draw in on a lot of these small outside, 
you know, like what is this out here? Steep Hollow?

06:00.135 --> 06:01.757
Yes, quite a few. But I have to say, I believe Blinn 
College at Brenham. gets more of that class than we

06:08.497 --> 06:12.461
do on county expenses. Glenn is so much cheaper 
than A&M. Much cheaper than A&M, and a lot of them

06:17.206 --> 06:21.910
drive and go. They just commute and go. And it was 
cheaper than paying dormitory fees and things

06:24.393 --> 06:28.697
like that. No, not as many, I don't think, as 
should, as they should. But I think that's the

06:36.345 --> 06:37.626
reason. I think that's the reason. Now, they seem 
like they got more from Caldwell than anywhere. A

06:45.762 --> 06:46.983
lot of people from Caldwell. See, it's close. They 
can commute there, too. But these other outlying

06:51.328 --> 06:56.953
posts, it was just about tit for tat, and they took 
the cheapest one. And then Glenn offers a night

06:57.714 --> 07:03.900
course, and they could... They could do that too, 
though they couldn't go in daytime, they could

07:04.758 --> 07:17.730
take

07:04.758 --> 07:17.730
a night course or two, and they got started that 
way. Since you as a preacher's wife, I imagine

07:17.750 --> 07:33.685
y'all came across or seen some of the sore spots or 
the, you know, not so happy spots, you might say,

07:17.750 --> 07:33.685
I'd say Brian, as it was growing, it's Yes, we saw 
them more than once. And yet, I don't believe

07:38.074 --> 07:46.421
there's ever been the trouble here that a lot of 
other places have had. They seem to have... Each

07:50.489 --> 07:55.454
class, they just seemed to have accepted 
everybody. I think one reason for that, and I hate

07:55.474 --> 08:03.043
to say it, is that they didn't mix and mingle. Each 
class just kind of stayed to themselves, and they

08:03.143 --> 08:06.707
didn't cause anybody in trouble. And that's 
unfortunate. They should have been drawn

08:08.108 --> 08:11.172
together.

08:12.873 --> 08:19.821
And the boys on the campus, that worried us a lot. 
these foreign boys that came to A&M, and now the

08:20.915 --> 08:31.929
Negroes, you know, we have quite a few of them now, 
but you never see them with anybody else. They just

08:32.670 --> 08:37.016
go with themselves, only in the field of 
athletics. They seem to be on equal ground in

08:37.036 --> 08:42.423
athletics, but haven't you noticed it on the 
campus? They just go in cliques with themselves. I

08:46.666 --> 08:51.752
don't know what would happen if they mingled and 
fraternized with each other. I don't know what the

08:51.852 --> 08:54.615
score would be there, because they don't do it. And 
we had three or four of those neighbors to join our

08:55.276 --> 08:59.641
church. They'd come, and if there's a seat by 
themselves anywhere in that house, they'd get

09:00.802 --> 09:06.849
over there in that corner by themselves. And the 
first thing we knew, they just quit coming. Why? We

09:09.292 --> 09:11.875
don't know, because everybody was 
cartridge-filling. I think that people went out

09:12.976 --> 09:16.200
of their way to make them feel welcome. But they 
didn't feel. And then our West Foundation has a

09:19.361 --> 09:23.925
very good recreation program there. Very good. 
And they insist on the students. It's open to

09:27.068 --> 09:28.149
everybody. But the Negroes never come. The 
Negroes never come. And it's unfortunate.

09:35.216 --> 09:37.178
Because it's there for them. But they don't come. 
Why is that? But I think that I don't know what would

09:41.242 --> 09:44.685
happen if they all got together Maybe it would be 
friction.

09:50.038 --> 09:54.783
And yet they get along so well in their athletics, 
you know. And they make no discrimination at all,

09:56.024 --> 10:01.971
the coaches or the boys either, I don't think. You 
may know more about that than I do, but with my

10:02.191 --> 10:07.197
observation, I don't think they discriminate at 
all.
