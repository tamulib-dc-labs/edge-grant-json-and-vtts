WEBVTT

00:05.617 --> 00:06.558
was to see a movie.

00:07.360 --> 00:10.685
I remember Gone with the Wind.

00:10.705 --> 00:12.487
And a lot of shoot-em-ups.

00:12.528 --> 00:17.175
We'd go Saturday nights, go see some good cowboys.

00:17.195 --> 00:20.840
And other than that, we didn't have any money.

00:21.281 --> 00:24.886
I didn't have any money to spend on much.

00:24.906 --> 00:26.409
And what movies were there?

00:26.489 --> 00:28.252
Do you remember the names of them, Downtown Bryan?

00:28.412 --> 00:28.993
That's what I say.

00:29.013 --> 00:29.373
Gone.

00:29.513 --> 00:30.715
Oh, you mean the movie Houses?

00:30.735 --> 00:32.518
Well, there were two of them.

00:33.916 --> 00:37.019
Gee, I want to say one of them was a Texan, but I don't know that that was it.

00:37.039 --> 00:37.600
I don't remember.

00:37.620 --> 00:38.461
I don't remember.

00:38.701 --> 00:39.682
I remember the location.

00:40.363 --> 00:53.998
One right across the street from each other, but one up next to that LaSalle, or in that LaSalle Hotel area, and I think there was a library on the other side, and I think this theater was close to that library downtown, as I recall.

00:54.158 --> 00:57.001
Describe the Northgate area firm.

00:57.021 --> 00:59.043
Oh, that was a super area.

01:00.385 --> 01:01.746
You could buy a 15,

01:02.283 --> 01:05.127
20 cent hamburgers, nickel cokes.

01:07.411 --> 01:13.741
You could have a date and on 75 cents, you'd have a royal date at the North Gate.

01:14.082 --> 01:15.664
Brilliant, true, good stuff.

01:16.125 --> 01:22.315
And it was just the hub of activity.

01:24.097 --> 01:25.419
There wasn't any other gate like it.

01:25.480 --> 01:28.324
I mean, North Gate was it, the bookstores,

01:28.692 --> 01:31.916
other than our collegiate bookstore.

01:33.137 --> 01:38.823
And yeah, that's where the drug store was.

01:38.963 --> 01:41.046
Was there anything at Southgate then?

01:44.710 --> 01:46.292
Over there where Maid Liz would later be?

01:46.792 --> 01:48.714
Never, not to my recollection.

01:49.255 --> 01:50.877
There just wasn't any activity over there.

01:51.738 --> 01:53.740
The project houses, tell me about those.

01:53.960 --> 01:57.484
Well, my brother, I didn't, I wasn't,

01:57.835 --> 02:00.739
They were primarily for the boys who returned.

02:01.240 --> 02:05.405
As I recall, education was interrupted by the war.

02:06.247 --> 02:15.199
And they got married during the war, and they'd have my brother and his wife and their first child lived in those project houses.

02:15.299 --> 02:24.872
In fact, when I got back overseas, George was already in the house, and I spent a night or two one weekend with him there.

02:25.291 --> 02:32.118
Now, during your undergraduate days, there weren't any major earth-shaking events on campus.

02:32.138 --> 02:34.600
There was no fire or anything.

02:34.621 --> 02:35.141
Was there any?

02:39.245 --> 02:53.680
No, I don't recall anything of any magnitude other than the fact that when Pearl Harbor was attacked, that is the largest single thing that I recall during my period there, except winning some great football games.

02:53.700 --> 02:54.741
Yeah, we all remember

02:54.873 --> 02:57.976
where we were when we heard the news then.

02:57.996 --> 03:08.487
I was a sixth grader in Fort Smith, Arkansas on, well, let's see, December 8, where were you, did you hear President Roosevelt's speech to Congress?

03:09.188 --> 03:10.649
I did not.

03:10.669 --> 03:11.330
Yesterday?

03:11.951 --> 03:12.111
Did not.

03:12.131 --> 03:13.372
December 7th, today?

03:15.254 --> 03:19.719
Since then, I heard it and have now seen it.

03:20.680 --> 03:22.922
But, no, we

03:24.303 --> 03:26.105
I don't know that we had a radio.

03:26.145 --> 03:28.027
I don't know whether John and I had a radio or not.

03:28.047 --> 03:28.988
I can't remember.

03:33.612 --> 03:34.093
Let's see.

03:35.534 --> 03:36.775
Did the average student smoke?

03:39.238 --> 03:40.699
Average student smoked.

03:40.719 --> 03:41.940
And what did they smoke?

03:42.341 --> 03:43.622
What brands?

03:43.662 --> 03:45.524
Lucky Strike was a big one in those days.

03:45.924 --> 03:49.248
Until Lucky Strike Green went to war.

03:49.888 --> 03:52.791
And that's what I smoked.

03:53.615 --> 03:54.516
No, I don't.

03:54.556 --> 04:05.889
Some of the boys roll their own, but they, I think they really did it out of, they knew, no, I don't ever remember chewing tobacco.

04:05.949 --> 04:13.597
Several of the baseball, the cadets who were baseball players, you know, that was a big thing, didn't have tobacco.

04:13.617 --> 04:21.546
In fact, I was a pitcher on our softball team, and I remember I thought, you know, maybe that's what I couldn't take.

04:22.403 --> 04:24.505
But I smoked in college.

04:26.447 --> 04:28.448
And let's see.

04:29.049 --> 04:37.576
Were there some places that either literally or secretly were off limits to students?

04:37.596 --> 04:40.059
Or some places y'all simply were not supposed to go?

04:43.882 --> 04:44.603
Not officially.

04:44.683 --> 04:45.283
I don't know.

04:45.303 --> 04:47.385
I don't recall that there was any official.

04:48.186 --> 04:51.168
Was there any red light area in... There was in Bryan.

04:51.329 --> 04:51.769
In Bryan?

04:52.222 --> 04:52.502
Where?

04:53.404 --> 04:55.867
Close to that theater right there.

04:56.127 --> 04:59.773
See, the LaSalle was the bigger hotel.

04:59.833 --> 05:02.496
Then there was a smaller hotel on the other side over there.

05:03.498 --> 05:07.363
But I don't recall anyone ever saying, no, you can't go down there.

05:07.383 --> 05:07.924
You just didn't.

05:08.725 --> 05:10.688
You either did or you didn't.

05:10.968 --> 05:12.050
All right, the drill field.

05:12.130 --> 05:14.753
What all happened on the drill field?

05:16.015 --> 05:20.862
Well, that's where, in our case, the field artillery

05:21.972 --> 05:22.933
We were horse drawn.

05:23.735 --> 05:29.183
We'd go through our activities on that drill field with our caissons and horses.

05:29.203 --> 05:33.710
Of course, we had a place across the tracks close to the stables where we trained and worked.

05:34.211 --> 05:37.756
And we'd actually go through maneuvers on the parade ground.

05:37.836 --> 05:39.258
It was fun.

05:39.358 --> 05:40.761
It was great.

05:40.781 --> 05:42.283
Yeah.

05:42.884 --> 05:47.030
Those were romantic days as it relates to real military.

05:47.070 --> 05:48.072
Was there a polo team?

05:48.653 --> 05:49.294
Oh, yes.

05:49.314 --> 05:50.275
Where did the polo...

05:50.558 --> 05:51.359
I don't know that.

05:52.020 --> 05:53.983
Those were cavalry boys for the most part.

05:54.144 --> 05:58.611
Yeah, we had, the cavalry was handsome.

05:58.631 --> 06:00.574
We had some great horses at A&M.

06:00.594 --> 06:02.637
Alright, final review, where?

06:02.657 --> 06:03.499
On the parade.

06:03.519 --> 06:05.241
Describe it for me.

06:05.261 --> 06:06.023
Fantastic.

06:06.523 --> 06:16.920
Well, that of course is when the entire Corps marches, the viewing stand which encompasses

06:17.153 --> 06:26.310
visiting dignitaries, but certainly the commandant, the president of the institution, and chosen other, I don't know who else, I know now, but I didn't know then.

06:27.392 --> 06:40.917
And you have the full band, and it's a, if you're a commander like I was, you actually have your saber, you actually salute with your saber and you have it.

06:42.635 --> 06:44.017
It's great.

06:44.037 --> 06:44.737
It's a thrill.

06:45.038 --> 06:48.782
Just a tremendous thrill to hear that band and 7,000 guys.

06:48.842 --> 06:52.506
You know, it's a big bunch of military.

06:52.546 --> 06:53.587
That's a bunch of folks.

06:53.967 --> 06:57.771
And it was beautiful.

06:57.852 --> 07:05.520
I say to myself, with all those seniors in their boots and very serious, we took our military very, very seriously.

07:06.381 --> 07:10.245
And those that were in command, because we were going to go on and certainly get our

07:10.647 --> 07:11.308
commission.

07:11.328 --> 07:14.372
So we wouldn't have been in command had we not been serious about it.

07:14.392 --> 07:20.660
And with the war being on, you all had to know in the back of your mind what might be next.

07:21.140 --> 07:21.721
Absolutely.

07:21.861 --> 07:27.869
You heard that from your family, your friends, and you heard it from the officers who you were working with.

07:30.092 --> 07:33.837
Did you go through a commencement?

07:34.037 --> 07:34.758
Graduation?

07:34.978 --> 07:37.862
Did go through a graduation, but I'd call it a mini.

07:38.142 --> 07:39.304
Where was it held?

07:39.324 --> 07:40.485
In Guyon Hall that

07:40.651 --> 07:43.674
You know, the one that they finally tore down.

07:43.694 --> 07:49.280
See, there was something over there by the Aggieland Inn, right close to Sabisa.

07:49.300 --> 07:50.261
There was a hall there.

07:51.362 --> 07:56.808
Something that I don't want to, I called it Guyana a while ago, but I don't believe Guyana Hall was the brick building.

07:56.828 --> 07:59.450
Yes, at the south end of Military Walk.

08:00.071 --> 08:00.431
Yes.

08:01.372 --> 08:03.755
That's where we got our degree.

08:03.775 --> 08:05.096
Okay.

08:05.717 --> 08:06.698
Every name called?

08:07.258 --> 08:08.059
Hand shaken?

08:11.397 --> 08:12.899
I don't think so.

08:12.919 --> 08:13.720
I don't think so.

08:13.740 --> 08:18.205
Now, who was the president of the university, of the college when you were?

08:18.306 --> 08:19.627
Well, I think Walton.

08:20.048 --> 08:20.448
Walton, okay.

08:20.468 --> 08:21.089
I believe he's on.

08:21.189 --> 08:22.831
In fact, I had my diploma in the car.

08:22.871 --> 08:23.372
I was gonna.

08:23.512 --> 08:24.313
I think that's right.

08:24.573 --> 08:29.379
There's a place in College State, I take this, and it's in good shape.

08:29.399 --> 08:34.185
But I think they do something with it to kind of dress it up, and I couldn't remember their name.

08:36.368 --> 08:38.150
Silver Taps.

08:38.170 --> 08:38.851
Oh, yes.

08:38.871 --> 08:40.273
Tell me about Silver Taps.

08:40.878 --> 08:46.864
Well, you didn't have the automobile accidents.

08:46.884 --> 08:50.548
You just didn't have the fatalities in those days that you have today.

08:50.608 --> 08:53.831
Of course, it was 7,000 as opposed to 40,000 or 42.

08:55.153 --> 09:04.202
And not having automobiles, it just weren't that many, but we'd have it maybe once a month, something like that, and we'd all fall out.

09:04.402 --> 09:05.403
Where?

09:05.463 --> 09:08.927
Right there in front of the academic building.

09:09.498 --> 09:11.220
And those buglers would be up there.

09:11.240 --> 09:13.562
Gee, I still don't know where those rhinos were.

09:13.642 --> 09:17.006
They were up there close to the dome, some area.

09:17.026 --> 09:21.511
And boy, every time I'd hear it, it'd do something.

09:21.531 --> 09:26.336
I mean, I never, I didn't look forward to it because I knew what it represented.

09:26.456 --> 09:31.021
By the same token, it was a thrilling experience.

09:31.181 --> 09:38.188
And I'll tell you this, I take great pride asking the fact that my big bells tolled

09:38.708 --> 09:40.851
You betcha.

09:41.031 --> 09:52.909
I'm really delighted that I was able to become a part of that because Silver Taps has always been, for our first time, just terrific, terrific.

09:52.929 --> 09:54.872
Mustard?

09:54.892 --> 09:56.715
Fabulous.

09:56.795 --> 10:05.167
Where was Mustard held on campus then?

10:05.187 --> 10:06.910
I want to say in front of the

10:08.611 --> 10:11.976
the system building, but I'm not certain of that.

10:12.156 --> 10:14.860
I'm not certain of that.

10:14.880 --> 10:15.661
I don't recall.

10:15.701 --> 10:17.744
Okay.

10:18.986 --> 10:22.330
You're getting ready to leave the campus to go off to war.

10:24.694 --> 10:26.436
What did you think was ahead of you?

10:29.380 --> 10:36.390
Well, here again, youth, the Lord, you know, takes youth and prepares them to

10:36.843 --> 10:42.150
look at things with a gleam in their eye and very little problem with their rear.

10:42.571 --> 10:49.981
And speaking for myself, I couldn't wait.

10:50.001 --> 10:56.931
I could not wait to get involved in this thing because many of my friends had already gone and were in it.

10:58.012 --> 11:00.275
And I was a good officer.

11:00.415 --> 11:04.521
I knew I'd be a good officer, but I wanted to be a good officer.

11:05.243 --> 11:14.691
How well did you think A&M had prepared you for the world you were gonna be a part of?

11:15.552 --> 11:19.976
At OCS, which was Camp Hood, and it was tough.

11:20.717 --> 11:23.059
It was really tough.

11:23.079 --> 11:25.221
Very, very rigorous.

11:25.241 --> 11:32.627
In that class we had University of Kansas ROTC boys, we had Harvard boys, we had Princeton boys.

11:32.647 --> 11:34.609
We had about seven schools

11:34.842 --> 11:39.128
ROTC, and there were 13 of us at A&M.

11:39.148 --> 11:41.932
It wasn't even a close race.

11:42.173 --> 11:45.478
It wasn't every calisthenics.

11:45.518 --> 11:46.739
Who led the calisthenics?

11:46.800 --> 11:47.681
An Aggie.

11:47.701 --> 11:50.165
Who led at Review, when we were in Review?

11:50.285 --> 11:50.906
An Aggie.

11:50.926 --> 11:55.432
I got to do it a time or two, and Jack Miller did, and Walter Cardwell.

11:55.512 --> 11:57.455
Walter was in our outfit.

11:57.736 --> 11:58.797
Willie Zappalack.

11:59.618 --> 12:02.082
We had a great bunch of guys.

12:03.074 --> 12:09.123
We were, those boys, you know, what the difference was, I don't mean to be mean it, their program was totally different.

12:10.024 --> 12:12.107
They had a few hours each Thursday afternoon.

12:12.147 --> 12:16.534
Man, we had that many before breakfast.

12:19.118 --> 12:32.878
To answer your question, I could not have asked for any more what A&M gave me in terms of preparing me emotionally, intellectually, militarily,

12:35.137 --> 12:35.858
than what it did.

12:37.039 --> 12:38.181
Couldn't ask for it anymore.

12:38.201 --> 12:42.365
Okay, we're getting now to the important question.

12:42.385 --> 12:48.933
What did it mean to you, now that you look back on it, what did it mean to you in your life that you went to amen?

12:51.416 --> 12:59.025
Well, number one, I became a man, a young man, but I became a young man at Texas A&M.

13:00.086 --> 13:01.988
I was a boy when I left high school.

13:02.947 --> 13:10.715
And I'd say by my junior year, I was beginning to get a feel for what it meant to be a leader.

13:10.976 --> 13:19.565
If you want to be a leader, you've learned the basic elements that it takes for true leadership.

13:20.746 --> 13:31.958
And one of the things that I learned at A&M that has stood the test for me for years is that fine balance of authority and responsibility.

13:32.680 --> 13:34.682
There has to be this balance.

13:34.742 --> 13:35.783
You're given authority.

13:36.644 --> 13:40.489
If you're not given at least a sufficient amount of responsibility, you can't do it.

13:40.729 --> 13:47.316
By the same token, people sometimes misuse authority by being irresponsible.

13:48.057 --> 13:51.381
So you have to manage this.

13:51.401 --> 13:57.648
And if you're given a position of authority, by golly, a lot of responsibility goes with that authority.

13:57.908 --> 14:02.333
By the same token, if you're asked to take on a task,

14:02.431 --> 14:06.156
You must have enough authority to be able to do it.

14:06.176 --> 14:12.864
I learned that at A&M, that fine balance of authority and responsibility, and it is a fine balance.

14:12.884 --> 14:24.719
But I learned all these other things, too, as I said earlier, integrity and character and recognition of character.

14:26.201 --> 14:28.624
What feelings do you have in your heart for A&M now?

14:37.801 --> 14:40.184
I mean, I truly do.

14:40.204 --> 14:41.266
I love my family.

14:41.386 --> 14:42.928
I love my country.

14:42.948 --> 14:49.277
I have a number of loves, but I tell you, A&M to me was the embodiment.

14:51.000 --> 14:54.585
Earl Rudder expressed it so well.

14:54.625 --> 15:02.897
He called our goal of the whole man, and now it would be the whole woman and or man.

15:03.248 --> 15:06.611
And I asked him on one of our trips that we had gone to the LSU game.

15:06.631 --> 15:09.934
We used to go to New Orleans and catch that train.

15:09.954 --> 15:12.996
And you used to get off right, the train went right to the LSU stadium.

15:13.217 --> 15:15.379
We had some great times down there.

15:15.819 --> 15:20.483
And on one of these trips, I asked, I said, Earl, I heard you say this whole man.

15:20.503 --> 15:21.364
What is a whole man?

15:22.044 --> 15:23.406
Have you heard this?

15:23.426 --> 15:24.046
It's excellent.

15:25.207 --> 15:33.154
He said, we want to turn out a student that is well educated, can take his place,

15:34.079 --> 15:54.690
in his community on graduation, compete, be a fine American citizen, love his country, be the whole man, educated citizen that will get involved in his community immediately, take charge, that's what we want.

15:54.910 --> 15:57.114
We don't want to just turn out educated people.

15:57.835 --> 16:00.559
We want the whole man concept and that's

16:01.484 --> 16:04.625
I think that's a pretty darn good goal.

16:04.645 --> 16:05.470
Let's quit with that.
