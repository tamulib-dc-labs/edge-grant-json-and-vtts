00:04.452 --> 00:10.745
27 October, 1982, an interview with Dr. Jerry L. 
Green of the Los Alamos National Laboratory. Dr.

00:11.186 --> 00:17.580
Green's a group leader of the MST-11 group and 
director of the lab's plutonium facility. An

00:19.684 --> 00:24.975
interview for the Texas A&M Oral History 
Collection by Justin Green.

00:27.858 --> 00:38.733
Dr. Green, could you briefly detail how you became 
involved with the Los Alamos National Laboratory

00:27.858 --> 00:38.733
and some of the steps of the career progression 
that have brought you to your present position?

00:40.956 --> 00:44.220
Well, I was an undergraduate at the University of 
New Mexico. I graduated in 1957. However, I first

00:48.265 --> 00:53.292
went to Los Alamos in 1956 as a summer student. at 
the end of my junior year. I spent the summer of 56 at

00:55.862 --> 01:13.705
the laboratory in what at that time was referred to 
as CMB 11, a slightly different nomenclature, but

00:55.862 --> 01:13.705
was effectively the same group, same function 
that I'm associated with now. At the end of the

01:14.406 --> 01:23.818
summer, I went back, finished my senior year at 
UNM, and graduated from the university in 1957.

01:24.338 --> 01:35.390
And at that time I went back to Los Alamos and became 
a permanent member of the staff at Los Alamos,

01:24.338 --> 01:35.390
again working in CMB 11. And I've effectively been 
associated with that group and the laboratory for

01:36.231 --> 01:50.667
my entire professional life, except for a minor 
stint when I left the laboratory to go to graduate

01:36.231 --> 01:50.667
school. During the period between 1957 and 1961, 
when I left the laboratory to go back to graduate

01:51.406 --> 02:05.365
school, I went to night school in Los Alamos, got a 
master degree in nuclear engineering.

02:09.516 --> 02:15.321
Incidentally, my BS, the original degree I was 
working on, was in chemical engineering. The

02:15.841 --> 02:28.173
master degree I got in night school at Los Alamos 
was, I believe it was properly referred to as a

02:15.841 --> 02:28.173
master degree in mechanical engineering with a 
nuclear engineering option. The university at

02:29.414 --> 02:32.837
that time didn't have a nuclear engineering 
department. And so the nuclear engineering

02:33.307 --> 02:39.215
degrees were handled through the mechanical 
engineering department. In 1960, I believe, I

02:40.197 --> 02:45.484
finished the master's degree. And in 1961, I 
decided to leave the laboratory for the period of

02:46.405 --> 02:57.420
time that would be required to finish my 
doctorate. So I left the laboratory and went to the

02:57.440 --> 03:02.267
University of California at Berkeley. where I was 
a student, a graduate student in the Department of

03:02.737 --> 03:10.317
Chemistry at Berkeley. worked there until 1965 
when I returned to Los Alamos. The actual PhD

03:18.250 --> 03:33.553
degree was given, I believe, early in 1966, but I 
returned to Los Alamos about Christmas of 1965 and

03:18.250 --> 03:33.553
went back to work until the degree was actually 
bestowed.

03:36.335 --> 03:40.339
I came back to the University, or to Los Alamos in 
1965. As I said earlier, I went back to the same

03:40.399 --> 04:01.360
group that I was in originally, and I've been there 
ever since, obviously as a staff member, and in the

03:40.399 --> 04:01.360
years since, I have become, gone up the ladder 
administratively. I've been in a an associate

04:04.820 --> 04:18.060
group leader, and then about five years ago was 
made the group leader of the group and have been

04:04.820 --> 04:18.060
that ever since.

04:18.080 --> 04:29.578
Dr. Green, could you briefly describe the 
National Laboratory System, how it's operated by

04:18.080 --> 04:29.578
the Department of Energy, and what's the 
association of the National Lab with the

04:18.080 --> 04:29.578
University of California? Well, in general, in a 
national sense, the national laboratories were

04:31.280 --> 04:46.555
set up to effectively take care of technical 
developments that were too expensive for it to be

04:47.851 --> 04:58.685
reasonable for the private sector to pay for and 
accept the risk for. And the government many years

04:59.666 --> 05:12.643
ago decided that the only way to be able to pursue 
some of these high risk and very expensive

04:59.666 --> 05:12.643
projects was to put them in laboratories that have 
been established as effectively centers of

05:12.978 --> 05:20.605
excellence for that kind of development. There 
are a number of national laboratories in the

05:21.606 --> 05:25.969
United States now. Los Alamos, obviously, 
Livermore, the Argonne National Laboratory, Oak

05:27.811 --> 05:39.441
Ridge National Laboratory, Brookhaven National 
Laboratory, and Sandia National Laboratory. I

05:39.461 --> 05:41.483
believe that's all of them at the present time. 
There are a number of other laboratories that are

05:41.918 --> 05:56.316
not regarded as national laboratories per se, but 
they are to be considered as national resources

05:41.918 --> 05:56.316
technologically.

06:02.337 --> 06:16.482
relationship between Los Alamos and the 
University of California and the way it

06:02.337 --> 06:16.482
associates itself with the Department of Energy 
National Laboratory System. The University of

06:16.850 --> 06:36.011
California has been involved with Los Alamos 
since the inception of the laboratory in 1943 and

06:16.850 --> 06:36.011
has agreed to continue its association with Los 
Alamos after the war and obviously up to the

06:16.850 --> 06:36.011
present time. It's my understanding, and I'm not 
being a lawyer, I don't really know the legalistic

06:37.413 --> 06:45.642
details of the contracts, But there is a contract 
between, well, starting with the AEC and then

06:45.993 --> 06:58.851
going to IRTA and now to the DOE, a contract between 
the University of California and the government.

06:58.871 --> 07:05.381
And then there was an additional contract between 
the University of California and Los Alamos. And

07:06.162 --> 07:15.595
both of those contracts together effectively 
tied the Los Alamos National Laboratory to the

07:15.929 --> 07:27.824
needs and requirements of the National Atomic 
Energy System, DOE, at the present time. The same

07:28.545 --> 07:41.802
kind of

07:28.545 --> 07:41.802
contractual arrangement also exists, for 
instance, between DOE and the University of

07:28.545 --> 07:41.802
California and the Livermore National 
Laboratory in California.

07:44.617 --> 07:51.692
Could you give a brief overview of the Department 
of Energy's plutonium program and what are your

07:44.617 --> 07:51.692
views on that program? Well, the DOE doesn't have a 
plutonium program per se. Plutonium obviously is

07:59.208 --> 08:05.241
a

07:59.208 --> 08:05.241
major item that's involved in the nuclear aspects 
of the DOE's programs. It is a fissile material and

08:14.246 --> 08:31.515
is obviously of substantial

08:14.246 --> 08:31.515
utility with regards to the manufacture of atomic 
weapons and also, and very importantly I feel, is

08:14.246 --> 08:31.515
also a a major item in the development of nuclear 
reactors. Most of the plutonium reactors, per se,

08:37.047 --> 08:45.399
are associated with the so-called breeder 
reactors.

08:49.004 --> 09:06.970
It is a fuel for breeder reactors, and the breeder 
reactor generates plutonium that can be plowed

08:49.004 --> 09:06.970
back into the system, if you will, and used for 
additional reactors, starting them up.

09:08.198 --> 09:16.291
Obviously, the weapons aspects of the use of 
plutonium is where it first started back during

09:08.198 --> 09:16.291
the war. And the use of plutonium, most modern 
nuclear weapons involve at least some components

09:17.532 --> 09:30.833
of the device that are made from plutonium metal. 
And so it has a substantial importance in that

09:30.853 --> 09:35.961
regard.

09:39.063 --> 09:47.755
Can you describe the operational function of the 
TA55 plutonium facility and its standing as a

09:39.063 --> 09:47.755
center for plutonium research? Well, TA55, the T 
incidentally simply stands for technical area.

09:56.447 --> 10:03.737
It's a local acronym, if you will, for various 
technical areas in Los Alamos. TA-55 is the major

10:04.409 --> 10:11.199
plutonium facility at Los Alamos. By that I don't 
necessarily mean that all plutonium work at Los

10:11.219 --> 10:17.267
Alamos is done at TA-55. There's substantial 
amounts that are done in other areas at Los Alamos.

10:22.635 --> 10:34.011
But if you're talking about operations that 
involve massive amounts of plutonium in general,

10:22.635 --> 10:34.011
they are carried out at TA-55. It's a large 
facility that is essentially dedicated to work

10:34.531 --> 10:44.325
with plutonium. It was initially commissioned in 
1978

10:45.427 --> 10:59.467
and has been operating ever since. The facility 
itself

11:05.362 --> 11:15.875
is the facility was originally set up as 
essentially a research and development center

11:05.362 --> 11:15.875
for plutonium. However, in the years since it was 
commissioned, there has been a substantial

11:16.776 --> 11:29.952
amount of quasi-production work that has been 
required by the DOE and TE55 has been utilized to a

11:30.370 --> 11:42.852
major extent in trying to provide what was needed. 
So there's a substantial amount of non-research

11:44.334 --> 11:53.290
and development work that goes on at TE55.

11:54.080 --> 12:11.598
Well, obviously one of the primary functions of 
the facility is carrying out the

11:54.080 --> 12:11.598
plutonium-related aspects of nuclear weapons 
design and testing, if you will. KE-55 and Los

12:13.500 --> 12:21.589
Alamos in general is not involved in the the 
national nuclear weapons stockpile. That's not

12:26.510 --> 12:31.235
the type of work that we're normally involved 
with. What we are associated with instead is

12:32.376 --> 12:49.534
effectively

12:32.376 --> 12:49.534
the development of prototype devices that can 
eventually be inserted into the weapons

12:32.376 --> 12:49.534
stockpile. In addition to that, there are 
significant programs that have gone on in the last

12:50.122 --> 13:02.356
few years that are associated with, for instance, 
advanced fuels and liquid metal fast-breeder

12:50.122 --> 13:02.356
reactors. We've been involved in the development 
of, for instance, the uranium-plutonium carbide

13:03.457 --> 13:16.112
as an LMFBR fuel since August. the early 1960s and 
have been heavily involved with it ever since.

13:24.161 --> 13:29.888
There are also projects that are associated with 
some special isotopes of plutonium.

13:30.689 --> 13:42.325
Plutonium-238, for instance, is used for the 
manufacture of what are effectively

13:30.689 --> 13:42.325
radioisotopic heat sources. They, in some cases, 
are used simply for that, as heat sources. For

13:47.952 --> 14:06.693
instance, some of these heat sources are inserted 
in various deep space probes, and their function

13:47.952 --> 14:06.693
is to generate heat and keep various electronic 
components, for instance, warm enough to operate

13:47.952 --> 14:06.693
reliably. In addition, manufacture or develop 
heat sources that can be married to thermal

14:10.548 --> 14:17.416
electric generators. And the plutonium-230 heat 
source, once associated with a thermal electric

14:17.436 --> 14:31.493
generator, becomes a very long-term and stable 
electrical power source.

14:32.958 --> 14:38.503
power sources of that type have been put on, again, 
space probes. And when they're going deep space

14:38.903 --> 15:00.703
probes, it gets so far from the sun that solar 
collectors and solar electric generators are no

14:38.903 --> 15:00.703
longer sufficiently effective than the thermal 
electrics can take over. run for the number of

15:01.105 --> 15:03.758
years probes life. Some of these thermoelectric 
generators, for instance, are sitting on the moon

15:07.901 --> 15:13.430
right now. These 230 gauge heat sources were sent 
to the moon and are still sending back or powering

15:14.451 --> 15:25.908
equipment that sends back various types of 
information. The seismic equipment on the moon

15:25.968 --> 15:33.019
now is still sending back information and is being 
powered by

15:41.858 --> 15:53.371
What are your feelings on the massive involvement 
the civilian industry has recently taken in the

15:41.858 --> 15:53.371
nuclear weapons industry?

15:53.391 --> 16:00.638
Oh, I don't think that the trying to categorize it 
as a recent involvement is quite correct. I think

16:00.739 --> 16:09.368
the private sector has been involved to a major 
extent throughout the the years that nuclear

16:11.069 --> 16:14.955
weapons have been in existence. I think that the 
nuclear weapons stockpile is a very large and

16:15.817 --> 16:28.538
complicated system, and it, I think, well it has 
been set up in a way that involves the private

16:29.750 --> 16:59.453
sector it might be possible for all of that work to 
be done strictly in governmental laboratories

16:29.750 --> 16:59.453
but I think that probably would not be terribly 
effective or efficient as to whether or not

16:29.750 --> 16:59.453
one should imply from your question that there may 
or may not be a

16:59.939 --> 17:04.907
It may or may not be proper for the private sector to 
be involved. I really don't have any strong

17:05.087 --> 17:09.234
feelings on that. The work has to be done, whether 
it's done by the private sector or the government,

17:09.875 --> 17:21.352
is really a pragmatic question as far as I'm 
concerned, who can do it and do it the best. It works

17:22.514 --> 17:28.123
very well, and when you've got a good thing, don't 
fool with it, I guess.

17:31.242 --> 17:42.357
Are the security measures currently in effect in 
regards to the National Laboratory and

17:31.242 --> 17:42.357
specifically in relation to weapons-grade 
plutonium or uranium? Do you feel that those are

17:42.838 --> 17:46.803
currently a reasonable defense effort?

17:49.627 --> 17:53.072
I think that it's perfectly reasonable. However, 
I think it should be pointed out that Essentially,

17:57.230 --> 18:02.737
no safeguard system can be absolutely foolproof. 
You can't have a safeguard system that allows you

18:02.838 --> 18:20.661
the freedom to get the work done that completely

18:02.838 --> 18:20.661
eliminates all possibility, for instance, of 
diversion. That possibility is always going to

18:20.722 --> 18:23.305
exist. The only way, for instance, that I can say 
that a given facility is completely free from any

18:23.926 --> 18:40.631
possibility of diversion is to slam the front 
doors and send everybody home. You have to have

18:40.691 --> 18:46.440
people involved in doing the work.

18:47.315 --> 19:16.275
fortunately or unfortunately the weak link in any 
kind of security system is the people and whether

18:47.315 --> 19:16.275
or not you can take a particular group of people and 
say these people are absolutely trustworthy

18:47.315 --> 19:16.275
unfortunately that's very rarely possible we do 
involve ourselves in some fairly rigorous

19:17.183 --> 19:28.481
techniques for trying to filter up people that 
might be a problem. But again, that kind of

19:28.661 --> 19:38.196
procedure is simply not foolproof, and I see no 
good way to make it so. To your knowledge, have

19:39.155 --> 19:52.725
there ever been any specific instances or 
operations in which security has been

19:39.155 --> 19:52.725
compromised or in which an appreciable quantity 
of a weapons-grade material has been lost or

19:39.155 --> 19:52.725
taken? Your question really had two parts. I think 
with regards to the first part, I really am not

19:57.679 --> 20:08.836
particularly knowledgeable with regards to 
security breaches, that is, informational

19:57.679 --> 20:08.836
leaks. The question of whether or not there have 
been significant amounts of material diverted, I

20:10.659 --> 20:21.396
think is what you were referring to in the second 
part of the question. To my knowledge, there has

20:22.051 --> 20:35.785
never been any well-documented or situation 
where it could be positively stated that material

20:22.051 --> 20:35.785
had, in fact, been diverted. It is frankly my 
opinion that generally significant amounts of

20:36.906 --> 20:46.075
material probably have not been diverted. Now, I 
can't see that positively from first-hand

20:46.095 --> 20:50.539
knowledge. but I know of no major diversions, 
certainly not from Los Alamos. Now that does not

20:57.152 --> 21:03.778
necessarily mean that material has not been lost 
at one time or another. There have been situations

21:04.819 --> 21:19.513
where material has either by accident or from just 
plain ineptitude been lost from the system. But I

21:19.932 --> 21:29.166
really don't know of any situation where I can say 
of my own knowledge that material has

21:37.718 --> 22:01.414
Do you believe that if a sizable enough quantity of 
material were diverted and, for example, were

21:37.718 --> 22:01.414
sold to some group, that it would be possible with 
the common knowledge or the technology commonly

21:37.718 --> 22:01.414
available to the average man to construct some 
sort of device that could be used more or less as a

21:37.718 --> 22:01.414
weapon? Oh, I think there's absolutely no doubt 
that if sufficient amounts of material were made

22:02.879 --> 22:17.800
available, possibly not to the common man, as you 
put it, but there are many, many people that are

22:18.286 --> 22:30.150
available that have the technical background to 
take a sufficient amount of material and make a

22:18.286 --> 22:30.150
rudimentary device. I think that the chances are 
that it would be very inefficient, but in general

22:38.738 --> 22:53.712
the kinds of things that clandestine diverters 
would be interested in manufacturing, I think

22:38.738 --> 22:53.712
high efficiency and high yield are really not a 
major concern. I think in a lot of cases, devices

22:54.412 --> 23:08.425
that might be built to use in nuclear blackmail 
situations whether or not they really work or not

23:08.793 --> 23:18.686
is not a major concern in the blackmail scenario. I 
think that all they have to do is make a good-sized

23:20.148 --> 23:25.976
mess, and they've served their function. But I, 
yes, I think that given a sufficient amount of

23:27.938 --> 23:38.192
material, it would not be incredible at all for 
rudimentary devices to be manufactured by

23:38.695 --> 23:48.567
non-experts,

23:38.695 --> 23:48.567
if you will. What are some of your perspectives and 
how might they have changed since you were a

23:48.587 --> 23:56.696
student at Berkeley on the anti-nuclear crusade?

23:59.159 --> 24:00.942
That covers a multitude of sins. The 
anti-nuclear... Well, I don't think I'd really

24:05.155 --> 24:14.990
like to refer to it as a crusade, although in some 
cases that's the way it's handled. There are

24:15.050 --> 24:34.639
people that do have legitimate personal 
concerns, and I would not for a minute try to

24:15.050 --> 24:34.639
suggest that people of that sort should not 
express those concerns. I think that in many

24:34.872 --> 24:58.146
cases, much of the noise that's been generated by 
the so-called anti-nuclear movements are, as I

24:34.872 --> 24:58.146
say, in most cases, I think, they are legitimate 
and they are genuinely concerned, and well, they

24:34.872 --> 24:58.146
should be. There are certainly situations where 
the nuclear devices that modern man has to deal

25:03.222 --> 25:10.253
with can be dangerous. There's absolutely no 
question about that. I think that generally

25:13.538 --> 25:26.378
though that much of the noise and flap that is 
raised by the so-called anti-nuclear movement

25:26.628 --> 25:28.710
principally based on ignorance. And that's 
unfortunate. And frankly, I think that a

25:33.115 --> 25:51.376
substantial amount of the

25:33.115 --> 25:51.376
blame for that kind of a situation may very well 
have to be placed at the feet of the so-called

25:33.115 --> 25:51.376
experts. And I guess I'll have to place myself in 
that category, too. People are dealing with the

25:55.973 --> 26:00.459
situation out of fear. And

26:01.540 --> 26:06.567
I think it's fear born in ignorance. And 
unfortunately the

26:07.808 --> 26:23.128
fact that they're ignorant has to be to a certain 
extent blamed on the people that are not ignorant.

26:23.800 --> 26:36.475
In the past few years, I think people that are 
associated with the nuclear industry have been

26:23.800 --> 26:36.475
trying to provide information to the public. But 
it's frustrating. It's frustrating to me because

26:39.739 --> 26:51.492
information that we do put out either is not 
understood intentionally or unintentionally. I

26:51.673 --> 26:53.655
can't really comment as to to what the problem is 
there, but oftentimes when we in good faith go out

26:54.057 --> 27:07.991
and try to provide information, it gets turned 
around like a snake in a hole and it bites us. It's

27:08.952 --> 27:17.301
very difficult to handle in what I regard as a 
reasonably responsible way. The public deserves

27:17.721 --> 27:21.145
the information, absolutely. Unfortunately, 
the information is sufficiently complex that it

27:21.749 --> 27:43.791
is a very difficult problem trying to decide or to

27:21.749 --> 27:43.791
come up with a technique to provide the 
information to the man on the street, if you will,

27:21.749 --> 27:43.791
in a format that he can understand.

27:50.217 --> 28:01.511
When you were a student at Berkeley, did you have 
any problems or were there any roots of the

27:50.217 --> 28:01.511
anti-nuclear crusade within the free speech 
movement that was active at that time on campus?

28:04.134 --> 28:11.402
As I recall, when I was at Berkeley, the free speech 
movement was in progress. However, as I recall,

28:12.324 --> 28:20.173
they had no particular involvement with the 
anti-nuclear issue. When I was there as a student,

28:20.845 --> 28:34.829
it was

28:20.845 --> 28:34.829
a little bit difficult to determine just exactly 
what the free speech movement stood for. The young

28:35.911 --> 28:44.946
gentleman that was the leader of that movement and 
got it started was a fellow by the name of Mario

28:35.911 --> 28:44.946
Savio. and he was there at the same time that I was at 
Berkeley. Frankly, just exactly what Mr. Savio

28:50.955 --> 28:59.121
stood for, I have a little bit of difficulty trying 
to determine at this point frankly at the time as a

28:59.641 --> 29:23.758
student I viewed it somewhat simplistically 
probably but Mr. Savio and his cohorts were just a

28:59.641 --> 29:23.758
bunch of ding-a-lings as far as I was concerned 
they really were I'm sure they thought they had

28:59.641 --> 29:23.758
something to say but I'm darned if I know what it was 
It was an interesting situation. I learned some

29:28.078 --> 29:38.854
things about the way that these so-called 
movements operate, and it was interesting to me. I

29:39.295 --> 29:47.147
was a student on the campus at the same time they 
were holding their demonstrations, and it gave me

29:39.295 --> 29:47.147
a at least relative to that particular situation 
something of an insight as to the way that people

29:47.819 --> 30:10.975
information and the media were manipulated by 
those groups I will have to say that they did it very

29:47.819 --> 30:10.975
well but I can remember any number of 
demonstrations, if you will, that took place on

30:11.174 --> 30:20.340
campus that I personally viewed there'd be 15, 20, 
30 people clustered together having a

30:20.843 --> 30:46.311
demonstration and the media would be there with 
their cameras doing what they're supposed to be

30:20.843 --> 30:46.311
doing and I'd go home at night and see those see the 
films played back on that particular

30:20.843 --> 30:46.311
demonstration and my goodness it looked like 
there were hundreds of people involved and they

30:20.843 --> 30:46.311
had the whole campus disrupted It was absolutely 
untrue. That was not the situation at all. And it

30:51.435 --> 30:58.090
was interesting to me how, and I very frankly feel 
that, well, certainly in that particular case,
