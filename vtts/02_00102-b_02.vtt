WEBVTT

00:02.832 --> 00:24.604
group of people that enjoy studying or reading and learning about the American West from Mississippi to California and all around and he was one of the key people to start that and he started getting people to speak to local people on this and bringing some of their collections and I know

00:25.833 --> 00:40.416
Dr. Dykstra House was one of the gentlemen that he knew that he got his, convinced him to leave his papers, and he was in the Parks and National Park Service, the Dykstra House collection.

00:40.676 --> 00:42.939
Did you ever meet Mr. Dykes, Jeff Dykes?

00:42.959 --> 00:45.423
Yes, he came to several of our... Describe him.

00:45.443 --> 00:51.773
He's just a, I don't know, a little short man that was very congenial, and he was always...

00:52.664 --> 00:55.329
wanting to build things for the library, wanted the library to grow.

00:55.590 --> 00:56.712
He was an Aggie, was he?

00:56.932 --> 00:57.674
I believe he was.

00:57.694 --> 00:58.575
I thought, I thought.

00:58.595 --> 00:59.638
But he lived in Maryland.

00:59.658 --> 00:59.818
Yeah.

01:00.399 --> 01:08.054
But he was always down here for ball games and noted things for the university.

01:08.374 --> 01:11.280
And he would always come into the library to see how it was doing.

01:11.750 --> 01:23.752
and he looked for materials, and he was a book collector, and also he would look for materials to add to this collection, because he wanted to build this collection for A&M to make it a noted collection.

01:24.914 --> 01:25.455
Let me turn this.

01:25.756 --> 01:28.982
Did you contact with Perfeo Salinas?

01:29.013 --> 01:32.258
And I just barely know him.

01:33.499 --> 01:34.821
Don't know him well at all, though.

01:35.062 --> 01:35.662
I wish I did.

01:37.625 --> 01:43.694
Do you know who it was that was the primary contact for Mr. Dykes giving the collection to A&M?

01:44.635 --> 01:46.137
Probably Henry Allsmeyer.

01:46.157 --> 01:46.498
Okay.

01:46.978 --> 01:48.721
Or Evelyn Smith, Evelyn King.

01:49.141 --> 01:50.363
And it was before his death.

01:50.427 --> 02:08.284
Right, so because Evelyn is one of the, and I are both charter members of the Westerners Club, so we met him, we'd known him with his contact in the library, but I have a feeling that she was probably one of the primary reasons he left his

02:08.382 --> 02:11.326
And there were no inappropriate strings attached or anything?

02:11.346 --> 02:12.088
It was a true gift?

02:12.168 --> 02:12.729
It was a gift.

02:13.369 --> 02:15.112
Oh, that's marvelous.

02:15.132 --> 02:17.996
We have, so far as I know, we have a policy here.

02:18.016 --> 02:26.409
This was always drummed into us that if you accept a collection, you don't say, well, it has to go in a special room or something.

02:26.529 --> 02:30.175
It has to be in this because that puts too many strings attached to it.

02:30.195 --> 02:35.082
There was one collection given to the library called the Templeton Collection,

02:35.062 --> 02:42.172
And they had a special rug and seating area for a former Aggie and his wife who died.

02:42.232 --> 02:46.078
And they had money for this collection, but it was a dead collection.

02:46.118 --> 02:49.562
Nothing was added to it because the money ran out with them.

02:50.203 --> 02:59.196
And finally they got permission to incorporate it between the rest of the university books, library books, which made it more usable.

02:59.176 --> 03:01.559
What did Mr. Dykes do for a living?

03:01.599 --> 03:01.999
Do you know?

03:02.300 --> 03:04.382
So far as I know, he's a book collector and salesman.

03:04.963 --> 03:05.303
Okay.

03:06.184 --> 03:07.285
I never knew what he did.

03:09.528 --> 03:21.642
Do you remember any, in all of your library work, remember any heavy-handed or inappropriate demands or requests for library service?

03:22.884 --> 03:28.390
Any regent or former student or politician or administrator?

03:28.758 --> 03:37.907
I just know that there was one or two administrators, which I cannot remember their names that, like I said, I mentioned earlier, when he left his office,

03:38.495 --> 03:43.681
Wherever he was going, his secretary always called and said, he is coming.

03:44.622 --> 03:53.373
And if he called and he said he wanted something, everything, everybody stopped what they were doing to find the information and get it to his office.

03:54.074 --> 03:58.179
And a lot of times he'd call at 10 for something that he needed by 11 o'clock.

03:59.160 --> 04:07.810
And I know if he was calling us, Mrs. Castle said, you will find this stuff and you will take it over there right now, not after lunch or anything.

04:07.790 --> 04:16.682
And everybody stopped what they were doing to find the information, because he was an influence with the university administration in our funding and everything.

04:16.762 --> 04:20.027
So we bent over backwards to get this.

04:20.207 --> 04:28.498
And we still, even today, to my knowledge, if someone in the administration calls and says they need something,

04:29.018 --> 04:30.240
That's priority.

04:31.041 --> 04:47.522
It's good politically, makes for good relations with the other department, with the administration, and they aren't that as heavy-handed, but we will put what they need, and more than one person will work on a problem.

04:47.983 --> 04:53.490
If they call in, and you get a call, you say, well, I need help in getting this for

04:54.820 --> 05:07.879
Dr. Bowen, we'll use Dr. Bowen since he's our current president, or whatever, just so that, like I said, we don't want them unhappy with us in saying that our services are not up to par.

05:07.999 --> 05:19.495
Do you remember any time when the library was told a definite no about the possibility of acquiring something, no, no, no, we don't want that or that, or we're not going to have that in our library?

05:20.605 --> 05:22.208
I don't remember anything like that.

05:22.228 --> 05:22.829
I've never heard of any.

05:22.850 --> 05:23.872
I've never heard that either.

05:23.892 --> 05:34.733
I know that there was a time period that caused a lot of stir on campus when we had to cancel a lot of serial publications.

05:35.134 --> 05:35.856
Just because of financing.

05:35.876 --> 05:41.567
Just for financing and we had to stop canceling a lot of the microfilming and

05:42.155 --> 05:53.653
We're still in a bind on this because the cost of serial publications has gone up so much where you and I as an individual could buy a magazine for say like $100 a year.

05:53.713 --> 05:56.458
It's thousands of dollars for a library.

05:57.439 --> 06:02.948
And there was a time period where we said, okay, Dr. Monroe, you subscribe to

06:03.704 --> 06:07.207
whatever America history today or something like this.

06:07.868 --> 06:22.643
So when you get through with it, give it to the library and you would, but when you retire or if you go into greener pastures, the subscription stops because you're stopped giving it to, or you stop buying it, then there's a gap.

06:23.083 --> 06:31.011
But we still accept and we still like getting gifts from people for journals with a stipulation that we can fill in.

06:31.362 --> 06:34.285
missing issues or damaged issues.

06:34.838 --> 06:41.627
And a lot of the people just don't realize that the funding has not gone up, but the cost has gone up.

06:42.608 --> 06:48.817
And so this is kind of, we're having to say no to buying a lot of new things because of that.

06:49.277 --> 06:52.682
And they say, well, you can get it online or get it electronically.

06:53.043 --> 06:59.391
But a lot of the publishers say, you can buy this electronically if you keep the paper subscription.

06:59.992 --> 07:02.235
And so you're double paying for it.

07:03.216 --> 07:04.558
And if you drop the paper,

07:05.180 --> 07:08.104
then you can't afford the electronic version.

07:09.146 --> 07:18.699
And paper versions are going to be around a lot more than some of the electronic because they say every so many years you drop off a year because you're adding another year.

07:18.759 --> 07:24.387
So there's this time period that you may have material that's no longer in existence.

07:24.907 --> 07:36.986
As far as you're aware today, are we comparatively balanced among the disciplines represented by the A&M faculty and student body?

07:37.466 --> 07:41.412
Are we comparatively balanced in what we are acquiring and not acquiring?

07:42.434 --> 07:48.463
Are there some areas where we offer instruction that we're not doing very well compared to some other areas?

07:49.765 --> 07:52.990
I think always your science and engineering budget

07:53.813 --> 07:56.237
takes the cost of their materials.

07:56.718 --> 08:00.984
It's so much more than that in the humanities and social sciences.

08:01.726 --> 08:12.042
So if you do a proration, you say, well, you're buying more humanities than social sciences, but you can get two books for, or three books for one science and engineer,

08:12.730 --> 08:14.112
and type material.

08:14.733 --> 08:18.940
So we're still building the humanities and social science collections.

08:19.801 --> 08:27.934
We're having to build, like I said, the parks and tourism is having to build because that was the recreation or the fun things.

08:27.994 --> 08:31.279
It was not thought of as a discipline, as a

08:32.677 --> 08:40.911
way people are having to stop to think about the use, land use in the country because they're unfortunately, they're not making any more land.

08:42.334 --> 08:54.415
And so much construction and metropolism is taken away with the natural resource uses and so we're having to preserve that and so that collection needs to grow.

08:55.627 --> 09:02.944
Do you all feel that A&M is, compared to the similar institutions nationally, do you all feel that A&M's library is making progress?

09:03.406 --> 09:10.362
We're making progress, but I think some of our statistics are inflated, personally.

09:10.949 --> 09:20.245
We've come up, when you have one to 10, when you say you have 10 fold, that's a big, but then you have someone else that has quite a bit more.

09:20.545 --> 09:23.951
Because when you have little and you double, that's a lot.

09:23.971 --> 09:28.118
But if you have a lot and do it, it's not as much.

09:28.438 --> 09:37.193
And we're still behind so many of the other major ones because the library had not been a major

09:39.738 --> 10:07.990
need for money in this university it was i felt like at the beginning when i first came here it was much more glamorous to buy a nuclear reactor or something in the sciences that had a big splashy name all over the world you said i bought a book well what's a book you know i've got a nuclear reactor you know that's something great that's going to the good of the country the good of the nation a book you know it's that type of

10:08.358 --> 10:18.770
And I think that's why our budget is not growing, because it's not the glamorous that's making the worldwide news.

10:19.852 --> 10:33.488
But you have not been aware of any failure of effort on behalf of the library by its leadership and by concern for the library by presidents and board members and so forth, have you?

10:35.257 --> 10:40.564
I think our library leadership knows we need to grow and improve, and they're trying to make strides in it.

10:41.124 --> 10:52.479
I think maybe some of the, quote, powers that be still want the headlines for the glamorous and the big name items as far as the library.

10:52.579 --> 11:02.091
And some of them are beginning to realize, well, you do need the library for the materials for the research that's put in to build these major projects.

11:02.898 --> 11:07.203
nationwide, worldwide items.

11:07.363 --> 11:12.649
What does the A&M Library, today and in recent years, what does the A&M Library do best?

11:14.611 --> 11:18.576
I think we've always been our service to the people.

11:20.598 --> 11:22.260
We're a people-oriented.

11:24.543 --> 11:25.884
And I don't see as much.

11:25.964 --> 11:32.652
There are times, and those have gone on to other people when it was, I can relate to

11:33.172 --> 11:40.221
our staff in humanities and social science, there's no, I'm the librarian, you're the peon.

11:40.842 --> 11:49.593
We all work together and we feel comfortable in asking, if we don't know the answer, asking someone else.

11:50.254 --> 11:58.825
If we have a student that has a background in something and a patron comes up and asks us a question,

11:59.615 --> 12:07.948
and we don't have the background, but we know even a student, we will ask and consult, and we consult with each other.

12:08.309 --> 12:12.455
We're not, I'm not going to tell you what I'm going to do because you might get more glory.

12:13.898 --> 12:21.049
For example, personally, we have a young man working for us now that his goal is to be a physician's assistant.

12:22.211 --> 12:25.015
And since the science and engineering people

12:25.197 --> 12:31.002
are not there on Saturday mornings, and I've worked with him, and someone asked something that's in a medical term.

12:31.022 --> 12:37.468
His goal, and he is doing this as well as he's going to school, he's gone, he's gone to paramedic training, and he's a paramedic.

12:37.488 --> 12:42.432
He worked volunteers with the EMT program, and he's up on material like that.

12:42.452 --> 12:45.095
I know nothing about that.

12:45.395 --> 12:50.219
I have no qualms at asking, Wally, help me find this.

12:51.360 --> 12:53.382
And he's an undergraduate.

12:53.733 --> 12:57.796
We had a young man that was an architecture student that's no longer here.

12:58.557 --> 13:01.560
And so he was up on the art and architecture.

13:01.860 --> 13:04.422
I didn't have a background in that, and others did not have one.

13:04.963 --> 13:09.887
We have classified staff that may have a degree in, we have one lady's degree in music.

13:11.408 --> 13:12.929
And so you come up with something like that.

13:12.969 --> 13:23.098
So if they have a talent or a knowledge that complements, and we work together to make our, to give the best service we can.

13:24.074 --> 13:26.757
And I think that's the strength of the library.

13:27.097 --> 13:28.299
All right, let's go to the other extreme.

13:28.919 --> 13:38.070
What does the Indian Library do least well for our weaknesses or not as strong points?

13:45.177 --> 13:47.500
Well, our collections need to be built.

13:48.222 --> 13:49.504
That's what I was thinking.

13:49.924 --> 13:52.648
I was just thinking if somebody asked me that question, that's what I would say.

13:53.149 --> 13:57.114
That we're making up for the emotions of the past.

13:57.154 --> 13:59.437
Making up.

13:59.457 --> 13:59.657
Right.

13:59.677 --> 14:00.959
And we're playing catch up.

14:03.723 --> 14:10.011
And we're having to cancel some materials that I don't think we should have to because

14:10.970 --> 14:17.357
Like, for example, they were saying, well, did we want to cancel some of those microfilm copies of some of the newspapers?

14:17.377 --> 14:19.960
Well, we've got a good background in these.

14:20.480 --> 14:25.746
Don't stop now because of the lack of money because we have such a good background.

14:25.826 --> 14:27.468
We don't want to have this gap.

14:28.349 --> 14:34.055
There was a time period where we were having to make choices as to what we bought.

14:34.235 --> 14:37.078
We had an excellent agricultural collection.

14:38.720 --> 14:39.120
And...

14:39.792 --> 14:43.299
That was our strength and our engineering collection.

14:43.680 --> 14:48.210
So we don't need and we didn't need then to cancel materials in those fields.

14:48.230 --> 14:48.470
Why?

14:48.791 --> 14:56.788
To build in the humanities, we need to keep up with that one and get money otherwise to build but not drop off because we had some of the

14:57.140 --> 15:01.444
agricultural publications that there were nowhere else in the United States.

15:01.504 --> 15:10.472
So why should we have a gap in some of these materials just because we need to build somewhere else?

15:10.952 --> 15:14.936
And they did make some gaps in some of the areas.

15:15.336 --> 15:27.147
Some key decisions in your 30-some-odd years, some key decisions that were made regarding the A&M libraries that have turned out to be very good, positive decisions.

15:28.257 --> 15:42.079
Going forward with technology and ergonomics, because ergonomics is a big thing nationwide.

15:42.399 --> 15:48.048
It's good for your workers to have them have the proper equipment to work with, the proper desk.

15:48.068 --> 15:51.413
We have less workman's comp.

15:52.743 --> 15:58.617
problems because we got the voice or the ear of the administration.

15:58.677 --> 16:02.506
The library, in fact, did a demonstration.

16:02.546 --> 16:05.813
We marched on Dr. Perry's office and said, look, we need this.

16:06.475 --> 16:07.798
This is why

16:08.234 --> 16:10.316
so we can better fulfill our jobs.

16:11.818 --> 16:15.101
And most of the people here in the library have been here long tenures.

16:16.042 --> 16:18.605
Most of our people have been here a long time.

16:19.586 --> 16:25.051
We don't have that much turnover among the classified staff where we would if it wasn't for that.

16:25.492 --> 16:28.295
Is there a good variety of background of those people?

16:29.116 --> 16:29.696
I think so.

16:31.138 --> 16:34.461
And a lot of our classified staff have degrees.

16:35.403 --> 16:40.215
It started out, when I first came here, they were wives of students.

16:40.415 --> 16:43.362
And of course, when those husbands graduated, they moved on.

16:44.505 --> 16:49.918
But a lot of them, either their husbands have gotten jobs in this area,

16:50.523 --> 16:58.701
There have been some that have gone on with their husbands, but they've parted company, and so they've come back here because they like the area.

16:59.042 --> 17:05.636
And I know there's a lot of people who say, oh, there's no social activity here, but we're kind of in the central.

17:05.716 --> 17:08.262
There's about a hundred and something miles to Houston.

17:08.242 --> 17:10.567
Almost 200 to Dallas and to Austin.

17:10.947 --> 17:16.178
So we're a nice location, and they can go within a two-hour time period to others.

17:16.278 --> 17:21.689
And we're getting more of the social and cultural things around in Bryan College Station.

17:21.729 --> 17:23.432
We don't have all the shopping malls.

17:24.087 --> 17:26.471
Our traffic pattern is increasing.

17:26.511 --> 17:28.894
We're getting rush hour traffic now.

17:28.934 --> 17:30.597
We're getting housing shortages.

17:31.538 --> 17:36.165
But we're still a good community to live in.

17:36.405 --> 17:38.288
And I think that's keeping a lot of people.

17:40.992 --> 17:49.324
What did, in these years, let's go the other, any mistakes or oversights where we missed some opportunities?

17:50.426 --> 17:51.968
Some things we should have done that didn't?

17:54.023 --> 18:03.897
I think in the expansion of the building, I think we should have more stack space in the new building.

18:05.099 --> 18:11.728
And I think I wish the top administration would see the need for this.

18:12.147 --> 18:24.158
and the need for our budget and realize that materials are growing in price and for us to keep up with just the day-to-day operations.

18:25.059 --> 18:26.520
That doesn't seem to be happening.

18:28.822 --> 18:40.112
Right now we have one of the newest areas on campus and I see other departments and other people eyeing our space and all with covetousness.

18:40.919 --> 18:47.447
and taking away some of the space that I think we need to put other programs in.

18:49.229 --> 18:55.337
I know they're going to open a center for writing, and that's something that the administration wants.

18:55.577 --> 18:58.541
All departments something wants that, and they're housing it here.

18:58.581 --> 19:09.475
This is a nice central location, but we're suffering because we've not started doing the technology I need for our

19:10.754 --> 19:22.866
I'll say special needs people because we had a room set up for adaptive technology and that was supposed to be something that has not been funded and it's not.

19:22.886 --> 19:32.055
They say, well, the students with disabilities office can handle that, but they're not open the hours of the library.

19:32.835 --> 19:38.601
And I see more and more special needs is the term now, people coming to

19:38.969 --> 19:39.993
coming to campus.

19:40.014 --> 19:46.241
I know we built a lot of curb cuts and sidewalks so people in wheelchairs could have access to them.

19:46.642 --> 19:48.912
We've increased in the handicap parking

19:49.735 --> 20:05.531
used to and still to today, I think, if someone in a wheelchair took a class and it was in a classroom that was in the upper floors, that class was moved to a building that was accessible, wheelchair accessible to class.

20:05.951 --> 20:07.973
But I see more blind students on campus.

20:08.133 --> 20:11.797
I see more people in wheelchairs that may have muscular dystrophy.

20:11.817 --> 20:18.223
I know we had one graduate student and she had a service dog with her that

20:18.743 --> 20:28.773
helped pull her wheelchair when her motor didn't do, opened the elevators for her, picked up her dropped pens and pencils and things like that.

20:28.794 --> 20:30.315
So you're seeing more and more people.

20:30.956 --> 20:41.547
I think nowadays more people with these disabilities are coming to college, and they're coming to A&M because we have good programs.

20:42.428 --> 20:46.472
And just because you can't see doesn't mean you can't be

20:46.790 --> 21:10.975
engineer there's an article in the paper of this lady that has gone blind and she's become a well-known artist and I can't imagine painting and not being able to see anything more than lights and darks and she's got a name for herself and so we're seeing more of the blind students we have more handicapped probably professors on campus than we did in the past.

21:11.656 --> 21:13.658
How in your years how was

21:14.212 --> 21:17.576
How would you summarize A&M's move to coeducation?

21:17.636 --> 21:18.837
How well was that done?

21:18.857 --> 21:23.502
In the move to coeducation, there was a lot of resistance.

21:24.403 --> 21:25.665
By primarily whom?

21:26.626 --> 21:37.218
A lot of the Board of Regents, a lot of the faculty members, a lot of the staff members, and a lot of the students, because this was one of the few all-male institutions.

21:38.059 --> 21:40.802
But once it happened, how were the women treated once they got here?

21:41.903 --> 21:42.784
With reserve.

21:43.186 --> 21:47.411
What about integration, racial integration?

21:47.972 --> 21:51.676
Probably the integration of women was harder.

21:51.696 --> 21:52.017
No, no.

21:52.037 --> 21:55.921
I mean, probably the influence of women was harder than integration.

21:55.982 --> 21:57.704
That's what I think.

21:58.665 --> 22:12.822
One of the first black students that went to campus, I cannot remember his name, but I know he was in that display that we had that Angus did, worked in the library, and he and I talked a lot.

22:14.236 --> 22:19.464
In the past, we had a lot of, we've always had a lot of international students.

22:20.465 --> 22:30.700
We had more people from, the people from India, Pakistan area was almost as much as population is from Texas, for example.

22:31.261 --> 22:36.329
So we've always had the students of other nationalities here.

22:36.909 --> 22:42.758
So I think that was easier for the integration because of this.

22:43.345 --> 23:09.720
Although I know a lot of international students kind of banded together for their social deals, but they tried to integrate with the others and they had organizations and clubs and they would have the, I know the Indian Association had their celebration and they still do in January where they have programs and now they have an international week in which they have booths set up for the people from the different countries to show.

23:10.020 --> 23:12.103
So I think that helped with integration.

23:12.674 --> 23:15.738
Because I think integration here went about as well as it could have anywhere.

23:16.119 --> 23:17.601
Right.

23:17.621 --> 23:21.046
We didn't seem to have anybody boycott a class because someone was in there.

23:21.106 --> 23:30.299
We didn't have them boycott restrooms or seating or anything else, at least not in the library.

23:30.840 --> 23:37.770
For you personally, what were your high points and low points in these 30 some odd years as a professional here?

23:39.269 --> 23:50.583
I'm a people person, so I enjoyed the variety of people that I came in contact with, whether it was an elementary school student from the public or one of the professors on campus.

23:50.723 --> 23:52.646
I enjoyed working with international students.

23:53.206 --> 24:06.643
I felt like that we in the library were ambassadors to the world because whatever help we gave, whatever impression we made on somebody, they took back to their native country

24:07.113 --> 24:19.226
And then they would come back because I had a student that was a very good close friend of mine in 64, 65, and he was from India.

24:20.067 --> 24:23.290
And he did his postdoc here and he worked here.

24:24.431 --> 24:34.302
And when he went back because of the way his visa ran, and then several years later in the 70s, I was at break.

24:36.475 --> 25:02.500
there was an Indian lady that worked for us and she was breaking at the same time and she asked someone, there was another lady here by the name of Lynn, she said, I have a friend back in Bombay that sent one of his postdoc students here to A&M because of the program that he was in, he was in agriculture, and

25:03.273 --> 25:12.828
I know him and he said to find out if there's someone at the library named Lynn because she will be a big help to him and she can find anything he needs.

25:14.331 --> 25:17.155
And I don't know who she's talking about.

25:17.315 --> 25:20.320
Well, the other lady's name was Lynn Furr and she was a thesis clerk.

25:21.242 --> 25:25.588
And she said, ask us, she says, do you know who he's talking about?

25:25.629 --> 25:27.812
And I said, yes, that's me.

25:28.433 --> 25:37.009
So this professor in India was sending his graduate students doing post-doc work to A&M to look up

25:38.170 --> 26:01.630
me and it made me feel good that somewhere else that i'd never seen occasionally and i don't now but i would hear from the students and like i said one of the ladies that lived in the house where i did um she was in statistics and her friends were of course the statisticians and she married a young man from indonesia and his name is suharto

26:01.610 --> 26:06.195
And his American name was Sam Suharto because they had one name.

26:07.036 --> 26:10.580
And she worked in the American University there in Jakarta.

26:11.180 --> 26:16.366
And now they're in New York working with the UN, both of them.

26:17.167 --> 26:22.833
And occasionally they come by through here to see how things have changed on campus.

26:23.574 --> 26:26.537
And I know Sam would be going to a

26:27.682 --> 26:35.274
conference in Europe and he'd circle by through College Station to see how things were here and stop by to see me.

26:36.877 --> 26:37.838
Which made me feel good.

26:38.319 --> 26:43.547
I've had students that were in some of my classes that I took that came back

26:44.962 --> 26:47.325
and said, I'm so glad you were in class with me.

26:47.385 --> 26:48.566
Can you help me find them?

26:49.888 --> 27:01.100
So, you know, that's some of the, and to see the guys and the people say, I'm leaving as soon as I graduate and I'll never darken the doors of the college station again, and here they are again, in some capacity or other.

27:01.340 --> 27:02.482
All right, let's go to the other extreme.

27:03.042 --> 27:09.990
During these 30-some odd years, low points, frustrations, sadnesses, disappointments.

27:11.512 --> 27:14.395
I hate to see a lot of my people, friends move.

27:15.910 --> 27:17.233
and lose contact with them.

27:20.700 --> 27:28.978
I think with the growth of the university there's not quite as much relationship with some of the ones in different departments.

27:30.000 --> 27:33.548
It's less personal now.

27:34.861 --> 27:40.608
There's, I don't know as many people, say, in the history department as I did then.

27:41.589 --> 27:50.039
And I know, I don't see as many of them coming, since there's only one entrance to the library as there was.

27:50.920 --> 27:54.865
And I wonder what has happened to some of my old, old friends.

27:56.387 --> 27:57.528
Alright, now I'm about through.

27:57.988 --> 28:00.632
What have we not talked about that we should have?

28:00.652 --> 28:02.674
Do you think of any topics we should have mentioned?

28:03.937 --> 28:16.530
Well, I know you asked me the other day to relate the fact that when I first came here, that not only the most important thing a woman could know on campus, not only which buildings had the ladies' rooms, but who had the key.

28:17.411 --> 28:23.958
And this was still important to some of the people in 1979, which was 10 or 12 years later.

28:23.998 --> 28:29.884
Because by that time, I was finishing up my master's at A&M in history.

28:30.484 --> 28:33.167
And Dr. Herb Lang was my chairman.

28:33.147 --> 28:38.415
And when I was doing the defense of that, he asked me, you know, he said, I know you're nervous.

28:38.636 --> 28:39.517
Just be calm.

28:40.459 --> 28:41.480
I'll take care of you.

28:41.520 --> 28:43.123
And Dr. Lang did take care of me.

28:43.584 --> 28:46.749
And he said, I know you'll probably need to go to the ladies' room.

28:47.410 --> 28:48.772
And I think, what was her name?

28:48.852 --> 28:56.604
Isabel, the Spanish-type lady that was a departmental secretary in history, has the key to the ladies' room.

28:57.586 --> 28:58.527
And he made sure.

28:58.547 --> 28:59.509
Yeah.

28:59.489 --> 29:04.099
that I had a chance to go there about midway through the time period.

29:04.680 --> 29:08.088
He was the old school and he said, well, do we need to take a break now?

29:08.529 --> 29:10.593
Did I need to do that?

29:11.074 --> 29:17.548
And I know I had someone on the committee who was in the College of Education and he asked something.

29:17.528 --> 29:21.174
about the dedication to my thesis or something.

29:22.056 --> 29:24.580
And he said, well, we just don't do that.

29:24.720 --> 29:26.884
And Dr. Long says, we do do that in history.

29:26.924 --> 29:30.891
That is important to us, that you acknowledge people that have helped you.

29:32.754 --> 29:40.667
So that's... Other topics that we should have covered?

29:43.870 --> 29:53.628
Well, it's good to see that a lot of the students that have worked in the library have, some of them have gone on and not come back in any capacity.

29:54.249 --> 30:01.282
Others have felt like they have learned so much at the library that they've gone on and gotten a degree and become librarians.

30:01.402 --> 30:07.954
So we've influenced a lot of students and a lot of librarians in the United States.

30:07.934 --> 30:12.059
I'm glad that A&M has, it was sad and it was good, too.

30:12.159 --> 30:17.145
We have a reputation of being a good training place for new librarians.

30:17.706 --> 30:25.175
I always told them at other library schools that we would, if they'd go to work at A&M, they'd get a good background in training for their jobs.

30:25.516 --> 30:37.350
And people that have gone on to other libraries have gone on as heads of departments or in the administrative.

30:37.769 --> 30:41.858
And they got their start here at the library.

30:47.451 --> 30:55.288
Let's make believe that you were hired as a consultant now to the decision makers regarding Texas A&M.

30:56.045 --> 31:04.276
What advice would you give them about A&M's library from here into the future?

31:05.197 --> 31:08.321
What should A&M do and not do regarding its library?

31:09.943 --> 31:16.252
I know the trend is to go to non-centralized library because of the size.

31:17.493 --> 31:20.938
But if you have everything in one area,

31:22.302 --> 31:28.093
They can be studying for their English class and have the materials.
