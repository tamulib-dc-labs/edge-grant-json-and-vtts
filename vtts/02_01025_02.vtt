WEBVTT

00:11.236 --> 00:13.678
Not anybody, really, of any great concern. He's 
just somebody that the Republican Party put in,

00:13.718 --> 00:18.463
but that's just voice and opinion. And I guess it 
says in itself that, yes, I do have a lot of

00:19.444 --> 00:28.112
resentment for people who legally evaded the 
draft or legally found themselves a way out. And it

00:28.752 --> 00:39.943
took many years to really learn that the Selective 
Service was more concerned with its upper echelon

00:28.752 --> 00:39.943
young men in keeping them out of the war and away 
from military service as it was. It was really

00:49.449 --> 00:57.779
interesting for me to learn in South Vietnam, we 
had 19-year-olds at war long before they did. And

01:00.443 --> 01:10.555
what is even more appalling is to know that most of 
the people that we fought were very young kids.

01:12.357 --> 01:15.580
The VC, they weren't old people. They were 30 years 
and younger. And it's surprising how many 12 to

01:18.583 --> 01:26.670
15-year-olds I bumped into. So in respect, yeah, I 
have a lot of resentment. But it's not something

01:31.034 --> 01:37.659
that's

01:31.034 --> 01:37.659
just one of those things that just no respect. And 
Vice President Quayle just fits in that category.

01:41.939 --> 01:46.145
Let that be on the record.

01:46.165 --> 01:50.332
Okay, returning to the United States after your 
tour of duty, did you find it hard? Like, here you

01:51.053 --> 01:56.340
were just in a jungle, and then you get back to here. 
The transition period? Yeah. Let me tell you, when

01:59.605 --> 02:07.457
I got my orders, when I received my orders, you 
know, you're finally going back home, and Things

02:08.652 --> 02:13.657
are relatively easy going in the processing, 
processing out. But then I always go back and

02:15.119 --> 02:17.721
remember that second lieutenant. And I began to 
look back in the servicing areas, back at Benoit,

02:20.224 --> 02:35.520
the hatred, the racial indifferences, the Yankee 
Rebel hatred is still there. I'm still seeing it

02:37.733 --> 02:39.915
today around the country.

02:42.618 --> 02:56.953
The black

02:42.618 --> 02:56.953
movements and your Uncle Tom's and your Harlem and 
Watts and Southside Chicago Loop, which I grew up

02:42.618 --> 02:56.953
in, is still there. When I was going through my 
process in the back, my mind was always there.

03:02.619 --> 03:05.642
There's still another war going on, a war that 
we're probably never going to find a solution to. I

03:09.611 --> 03:11.092
don't know. But it's just, it was there. And that 
transition always kept me alert.

03:17.879 --> 03:22.244
The moment that plane took off, it just felt like 
being drained. All of the emotional ties of

03:23.565 --> 03:27.169
knowing that you're finally going home were 
there. And I remember all the guys there just,

03:28.270 --> 03:34.296
everybody just screamed and hollered. Wanted 
something to drink, but I don't think there was

03:34.816 --> 03:37.781
anything on the plane to drink. Except whatever, 
somebody happened to sneak in on the plane. And all

03:42.128 --> 03:44.612
of a sudden, you know, we were all happy guys. For 
one, for less than an hour, we were all happy guys,

03:44.712 --> 03:47.557
you know. And then somebody lit up a joint. It 
started smoking, and immediately officers

03:51.263 --> 03:54.207
converged on him. This guy was a criminal now, you 
know. And it wasn't even funny anymore. And we're

04:00.128 --> 04:06.555
going like, you're going to actually arrest and 
court-martial this guy now. And less than 20

04:07.315 --> 04:11.079
minutes ago, you're over there hugging and 
kissing the guy. I mean, not kissing, but hugging

04:11.099 --> 04:15.684
him and shaking his hand and saying, job well done, 
soldier, and all this and that. And then turn right

04:15.724 --> 04:18.928
around, and he makes just a slight mistake. And now 
we're in a whole different world. Transition was

04:22.071 --> 04:25.174
rather difficult, because even when I did get 
back, Especially in California, it's so relaxed

04:26.285 --> 04:29.691
out there. Right. That's essentially the 
immediate transition. When I came back home, it

04:33.998 --> 04:38.645
was like, oh, where you been, Claude? I ain't seen 
you in two years, man. I've been doing this. I said,

04:45.036 --> 04:49.002
yeah, well, I've been gone. Well, that's 
basically it. When you left, yeah, when you first

04:51.702 --> 04:59.992
left, did you feel guilty that you were going to get 
to go home, or did you feel, well, I did my time?

05:00.773 --> 05:05.158
Yeah, I always felt I did the best I could, but yeah, 
you do feel bad. You leave friends, you leave

05:05.358 --> 05:07.000
people. I never really got real close to anybody. I 
tried not to. It was important to me not to get too

05:11.906 --> 05:13.788
attached. Mm-hmm. It's just one of those 
psychological feelings that you don't want to

05:14.682 --> 05:28.321
deal with, having to see someone that you've been 
sitting there talking about his problems or your

05:14.682 --> 05:28.321
problems, and then feel a close attachment. Now, 
some guys did, simply because they got a little

05:28.362 --> 05:43.423
more out of it, or closeness than I did, but there 
was nothing, you know, the only sad part about it

05:28.362 --> 05:43.423
was knowing that I was no longer going to be there, 
and I really didn't want to be there. The

05:49.859 --> 05:52.501
transition period was very brief for me. I 
immediately came home to find a whole different

05:52.662 --> 06:04.413
world a year later, two years later, and then 
finding all the different movements that were

05:52.662 --> 06:04.413
going on here, the different fads. It was 
essentially like another chapter in your life.

06:08.116 --> 06:09.237
Turn the page. Start a new day and a new writing, 
something new. to do and so I went back to school.

06:17.626 --> 06:26.597
Did it make you bitter that back here not a lot of 
people knew actually what was going on and like you

06:17.626 --> 06:26.597
said, they came up and asked you, you know, where 
have you been? Yeah, well, yeah, they were more

06:26.617 --> 06:43.397
concerned about the girl that, you know, that was, 
they met at the dance the other night, you know, and

06:26.617 --> 06:43.397
I'm going, it's nice to talk, oh, she was good 
looking, you know, and I'm going, yeah, I guess so,

06:26.617 --> 06:43.397
yeah. No. There was no bitterness. It's just that I 
knew what I had done. I can't help it if they didn't

06:50.771 --> 06:54.454
know what they were doing, what they didn't know. 
There are just so many people in this country that

06:56.316 --> 07:01.040
are so ignorant to reality. And at that particular 
time, unless you were a student, then you became

07:02.481 --> 07:08.266
aware. Take the number of students versus the 
population. You have very little. So everybody

07:14.444 --> 07:25.094
still dealt with only knowing what the media told 
them and what they read in the paper, which

07:14.444 --> 07:25.094
essentially was played down because of the Nixon 
administration. So, you know, it's just one of

07:25.134 --> 07:27.397
those things. The people are more concerned with 
their everyday life, you know, and it's good that

07:28.518 --> 07:33.723
you're back now, not you're back here, it's okay, 
you know. I'm going, yeah, thanks a lot, you know.

07:37.506 --> 07:39.548
This is what I lived for, right. Is there 
anything... Anything of importance that you

07:43.688 --> 07:53.779
think, essentially maybe that you learned about 
yourself from going to Vietnam or that you learned

07:43.688 --> 07:53.779
in general?

07:56.481 --> 07:56.942
In general?

08:00.205 --> 08:02.348
Basically we should get involved in an incident 
like that. I think we have a very similar incident

08:02.368 --> 08:08.114
going on down in Nicaragua, down in Central 
America. It's just one of those things that we're

08:08.134 --> 08:12.278
pumping too much money pumping too many guns. 
We're going to find ourselves either as taxpayers

08:16.284 --> 08:22.250
spending more money in that direction. And it's 
essentially the same history that Vietnam went

08:22.310 --> 08:29.016
through.

08:30.338 --> 08:37.265
If we did anything, we should be able to look back 
and see why Vietnam became such an important

08:30.338 --> 08:37.265
issue. If I learned anything, I learned to read 
more. And I learned to be able to search more for

08:41.603 --> 08:53.963
reasons and to really do something with and commit 
myself because I have a better understanding. I

08:54.063 --> 08:54.744
was young. Not a lot of us were young. Look at the age 
group. The age is the difference between World War

08:58.991 --> 09:06.683
II and the real goal we had then versus the goal we 
had in Vietnam. So essentially if I've learned

09:09.110 --> 09:14.420
anything it's become cognizant. What

09:14.701 --> 09:23.999
about anything that you might want to talk about 
that I haven't asked you? We didn't really deal too

09:25.361 --> 09:26.844
much with drugs. That seems to be the most 
important thing that went on for a long time.

09:35.671 --> 09:39.557
You know, I'll give you an incident, and, you know, 
we'll just look at it from there. But I remember one

09:39.657 --> 10:05.374
day, you know, it was kind of a rather long day for me 
because I helped out at a hospital, at one of the

09:39.657 --> 10:05.374
evac hospitals, and I came back to the

09:39.657 --> 10:05.374
dispensary, and the surgeon that worked with us, I 
had a few beers there, so I drank them. I felt a

10:06.215 --> 10:18.694
little more at ease and then I happened to walk 
outside and two little Puerto Rican guys come over

10:06.215 --> 10:18.694
to me and they said, hey doc, you got any needles 
there? I said, needles? You know, I need some

10:19.876 --> 10:23.441
needles. And that's when I began to really see more 
and more heroin. I mean, it was probably there, I

10:29.711 --> 10:32.014
just didn't pay attention to it. And I began to to 
start seeing that, you know, these guys, you know,

10:34.970 --> 10:40.659
they're really down into it. So I gave him a few 
needles and told him, you know, keep it cool, and he

10:40.679 --> 10:47.870
says, yeah, sure, you know, we'll be okay. One of 
them OD'd that night. But I went outside, and there

10:51.836 --> 11:02.732
by one of the sides of the bunks there, several of 
the guys were together. And one of them had a pipe.

11:08.551 --> 11:10.854
We used to do this on the fire base. And the fire base 
is about the only time you ever did any smoking, if

11:10.875 --> 11:14.741
you did any smoking. Because essentially, you 
have a secure perimeter. You had a lot of guys that

11:17.325 --> 11:18.547
didn't smoke. So somebody was always alert. So you 
didn't really have to deal with getting, if you did

11:20.090 --> 11:28.804
get high, you were pretty well secured. But this 
particular situation, this one guy had this pipe,

11:29.493 --> 11:36.521
and he had this Cambodian weed dipped in opium. And 
they asked me, hey, you want a hit? I went, sure,

11:40.025 --> 11:43.630
I'll take a hit. I got nothing else to do, right? I 
mean, what else could go wrong? So I took a good

11:49.236 --> 11:54.302
whiff of that. you know, held it long enough and 
released it and took another one, held it long

11:55.396 --> 12:09.208
enough and released it and then slowly, very 
slowly began to stand up and then things started

11:55.396 --> 12:09.208
getting blank, you know. And for the next 36 hours 
it seemed like, that time period, I remember going

12:11.089 --> 12:24.981
over the showers and I remember standing under the 
shower and I stood there at least two hours

12:28.673 --> 12:32.878
And this is late at night. I don't remember what 
time I left the showers, but the Hoochie Maids came

12:32.978 --> 12:38.524
in the next morning and I was still in there. But the 
showers were off.

12:43.409 --> 12:45.952
And it was just like, what happened? I mean, this 
stuff was good, but Jesus Christ, what happened?

12:52.298 --> 12:54.681
And I remember going back and just laying in the 
bunk. And like I said, 36 hours later, I woke, I

12:54.721 --> 12:58.326
really woke out of it. And they told me what was in 
it, but they said, you were acting real strange,

12:58.546 --> 13:05.435
you know. I said, thanks a lot. From then on, I never 
touched the stuff. I always asked what it, you

13:08.139 --> 13:12.725
know, it was just dipped in opium or not. But as far 
as just smoking, I'd smoke. But So I learned very

13:17.105 --> 13:24.653
quickly, you know, what drugs were about, and I 
just said, hey, you know, it's just not something

13:17.105 --> 13:24.653
that I need to get into. And it was surprising that I 
had so many friends, well, not friends, but fellow

13:26.055 --> 13:39.930
soldiers there that were into heroin, because it 
was so cheap. And here again, you know, the

13:39.950 --> 13:44.975
problems of the field didn't seem so important 
anymore. The problems of being among each other

13:47.328 --> 13:49.130
seemed greater. So there really was a big problem 
and it was really strange that you couldn't trust

13:50.111 --> 13:56.717
the people that you were immediately working 
with. And that's just, you know, something that we

13:57.958 --> 14:04.505
even have today among ourselves, you know, just in 
everyday life. So that was one important issue

14:06.207 --> 14:13.774
that always stood firm is just how bad the drug 
scene was. And a lot of it had to do with just the fact

14:14.092 --> 14:18.639
that we had no purpose, you know. And that we were, 
and those of us that had been out in the field, you

14:19.801 --> 14:27.593
know, had come to a realization that we may not come 
home the next day. And so, you know, on the fire

14:27.613 --> 14:32.701
bases, you went out and had a great time. You know, 
if you got drunk and ended up beating each other up,

14:33.021 --> 14:42.816
you know, it was the next morning you knew that, 
black eyes or not, you're getting on that

14:33.021 --> 14:42.816
helicopter and you're rolling out, you know. Did 
it affect you in any way, like out in the field

14:44.062 --> 14:57.919
fighting, knowing that, did you start to be more 
careful at any point, or worry about what you were

14:44.062 --> 14:57.919
doing, or was it like that all the time? Well, to 
begin with, I never went out in the field

14:57.959 --> 15:04.467
intoxicated by drugs or beer. And you're so 
physically fit to begin with, and you sweat it all

15:05.569 --> 15:10.795
out that you don't carry that with you. No, the only 
thing that bothered me was the racialness. You

15:14.724 --> 15:18.368
know, he went back to the fire base, and the blacks 
would go one way, the Mexicans would go the other.

15:19.210 --> 15:20.651
Puerto Ricans go in another direction. The 
hillbillies from Arkansas would go in their

15:20.772 --> 15:23.815
direction. The New York cats would go in their 
direction. And then all of a sudden, you know,

15:26.259 --> 15:29.182
they'd be cussing and fighting, you know. And then 
the next morning, we're sitting in a helicopter.

15:33.308 --> 15:37.273
We all, those of them who got into each other, you 
know, are still mad at each other. But now we're

15:37.333 --> 15:38.594
working with each other. We're fully... fully 
automated, you know? And we've got all the

15:42.748 --> 15:49.278
automatic weapons and the scopes and the grenade 
launchers, the shotguns with us. So we really

15:49.298 --> 15:51.701
carried that grunt.

16:04.822 --> 16:08.187
I'm discussing

16:08.808 --> 16:11.751
what it was like being in the field and how you felt 
being in the field. Well, as I was saying, if we

16:13.653 --> 16:25.184
really carried that grudge, we had an opportunity 
to do something right then and there. But it's

16:25.204 --> 16:38.157
surprising, just the whole theater in itself, 
that we were more concerned about our duties

16:25.204 --> 16:38.157
during the daytime and the time that we were out in 
the field that we didn't care about our inner

16:39.672 --> 17:08.751
thoughts and yet as soon as we get back to a fire base 
or to a main secure zone where we can forget about

16:39.672 --> 17:08.751
the jungle then all of a sudden the 18 or 20 years 
prior to going to Vietnam all came back into play

16:39.672 --> 17:08.751
and you really began to see that the trust among 
each other all only depended upon how you really

16:39.672 --> 17:08.751
felt among each other And that's the grudges of 
black hating white and rich against poor and more

17:09.288 --> 17:22.607
educated versus uneducated all stepped into 
play. And that's something that your

17:22.627 --> 17:33.743
interactions among so many different people from 
all over the country and the hostilities that we

17:22.627 --> 17:33.743
have in our own country were with us there. And it 
wasn't like you're a friend, you know, one day, and

17:34.803 --> 17:40.110
the next day you're willing to kill each other. So 
different times you just, not everybody got

17:40.130 --> 17:47.860
along, but when it came down to the actual having to 
engage. And one of the platoons adjacent with us

17:49.422 --> 18:04.101
one time, although there was a lot of grudge 
against this West Point second lieutenant, that

17:49.422 --> 18:04.101
in one particular incident, which ended in his 
life, was the fact that he was so concerned about

18:04.925 --> 18:17.456
increasing his rank that one of the Claymore mines 
has tripped. And for some reason, he wanted to be

18:19.058 --> 18:26.324
the first one out there to check it out. He ended up 
tripping over another one, which ended his life.

18:32.970 --> 18:34.712
There was no remorse for him. you know that's a 
shame because you know you know you're only close

18:36.076 --> 19:05.357
because you're having to work with each other but 
at the same time the grudges from back home and the

18:36.076 --> 19:05.357
grudges that have always played in the back of your 
mind were there and uh it just you know to me there

18:36.076 --> 19:05.357
was a not caring attitude I think that was a low 
point in my life is the sense that that uh I learned

19:05.708 --> 19:11.556
to just be the type of person that dehumanized. 
There was no want, no caring at one particular

19:11.576 --> 19:17.845
point. It was just something that stood out the 
most. We were there. You weren't going home right

19:22.892 --> 19:32.745
away regardless.

19:33.856 --> 19:47.278
I guess that's it, unless there's anything... No, 
basically that's, you know, I know that in your

19:33.856 --> 19:47.278
class and, you know, you're young, you're having 
to look back and see. You're hearing more about

19:47.318 --> 19:50.683
Vietnam and the people. I even just read this 
morning that General Gieff is doing fine and well

19:51.001 --> 20:01.372
in his little fishing town in Dubuque or something 
like that. It's right next to Houma, Louisiana.

20:03.535 --> 20:04.696
And that was funny to listen. I mean, just to look in 
the paper and catch that, because he was so much of a

20:04.736 --> 20:12.004
strong person and president, you know, prime 
minister, that is. South Vietnam during 65 and 68.

20:15.088 --> 20:20.974
But there's so much news coming out nowadays, 
especially with movies and stuff, with people

20:15.088 --> 20:20.974
trying to bring back old feelings and bringing 
back the triumph. But I don't think we should ever

20:24.613 --> 20:26.476
forget. We should ever really think back and not 
feel that those were very tormented years. And to

20:33.247 --> 20:42.682
those of us that took part in it, it's very, very 
close to the many of Americans that lost sons and

20:33.247 --> 20:42.682
daughters. I include daughters because I guess 
they were females. I didn't know of any, but still.

20:49.810 --> 20:53.556
it's not something we should ever forget and we 
should ever really feel. It's just that today in

20:54.156 --> 21:13.485
this country, you know, you see so much, so much 
hatred, you know, so much discontent, so much

20:54.156 --> 21:13.485
cheating, so much stealing, and I don't think, 
maybe it's not any different than it was back in the

20:54.156 --> 21:13.485
50s, but it's just something that, you know, the 
direction in which this country goes is very

20:54.156 --> 21:13.485
important. I guess that's why many of us, you know, 
we finally, we're getting together, we're

21:14.527 --> 21:19.294
finally beginning to look and to ask the questions 
together. How did the movies today about Vietnam,

21:23.338 --> 21:31.149
do they mean anything at all to you, or are they just 
movies? Well, they're movies. That's some points

21:32.692 --> 21:33.873
in time. There are a few movies in certain 
instances that can bring you right directly to

21:33.974 --> 21:39.702
that confrontation period. But I guess the 
greatest movie that I ever saw had anything to do

21:41.785 --> 21:47.914
with Vietnam was called Hearts. I know, Hearts of 
Mind. Yeah, Hearts of Mind. Did you see that? We saw

21:52.913 --> 21:53.914
it in class. Yeah, because it was so direct, and it 
was something that I visioned, that I visually

21:53.934 --> 22:02.065
saw, part of. And, you know, it's just, you know, 
it's not Hollywood. Right. That's really

22:09.656 --> 22:17.867
important, is that we do look at our country as a 
broad foreign policy, with an open mind and an open

22:18.556 --> 22:23.543
thought of what we're really there and what is our 
purpose. But that stands out. The PBS's 13 series

22:26.807 --> 22:35.199
of the 10,000 Day War stands out because it is 
documented. Very few people see them. They're

22:39.064 --> 22:41.247
more concerned with coming home and the deer 
hunter. And the only thing good about the deer

22:42.749 --> 22:47.415
hunter was the fact that it was well acted. De Niro

22:48.509 --> 23:05.272
played the part very well, but the sentimental 
value of knowing and the transition and all the

22:48.509 --> 23:05.272
things that you went through as a soldier there put 
a tear in your eye when you walked out of there. I

23:05.372 --> 23:09.698
know it did me, and it wasn't so much because I 
related to any of the things that happened there.

23:09.718 --> 23:12.802
Some of the things I saw, some of them I didn't. But 
at the same time, the I guess it's the speed at which

23:18.040 --> 23:36.119
life went at that particular time period and those 
months that I was there really stood forward and I

23:18.040 --> 23:36.119
guess I just felt it in the movie and in the very end 
when they sang the final song.

23:38.962 --> 23:42.746
Movies like that generally don't really appeal to 
me. Platoon was just another another version of a

23:45.479 --> 23:48.323
John Wayne movie of years ago. I mean, I understand 
Hollywood plays so much to capture your thoughts,

23:48.864 --> 24:01.463
but sometimes they go a little bit abroad. You 
don't really see it and feel it. And it's just a

24:05.009 --> 24:13.782
shame that the things that went on over there, the 
death, to see the women and children simply

24:14.977 --> 24:20.303
because they were in an area they weren't supposed 
to be in, will always stay in the back of my mind. And

24:20.783 --> 24:25.649
to remember that soldier crying out about, damn 
it, he didn't want to die here. I want to go home, but

24:26.350 --> 24:28.472
I don't want to go home in a bag. That always stands 
out. And to come out of the field, that's serious,

24:31.655 --> 24:44.089
come out of the field of being among all that, 
moisture, all those leeches, all those snakes,

24:45.250 --> 24:54.885
you know, which a couple of them crawled over my 
leg, you know. I was so tired, I didn't want to move.

24:56.688 --> 25:05.221
All I did was, one particular incident, one 
crawled over and he went toward a Harlem cat and was

24:56.688 --> 25:05.221
so tough, you know, he ran. I told him there was a 
snake coming after him.

25:10.710 --> 25:12.152
Just all those things, you know, just that happen 
out in the field, and then you come back and get

25:13.853 --> 25:23.326
reassigned into a base very close to the major city 
of Saigon. And then across the air base there at

25:24.868 --> 25:30.696
Benoit, they've got a theater that's just like the 
one back home. You've got a long bin, and they've

25:32.358 --> 25:36.143
got tennis courts just like the ones back home. And 
a lot of libraries and all kinds of goodies, you

25:37.905 --> 25:40.649
know. And you're going, now these are for the 
officers. And for the people of the higher

25:43.773 --> 25:53.725
echelon, we've got to go over there and sit with 
bunkers and pull guard duty. It just really makes

25:55.487 --> 26:08.703
you think about life in general and what you feel is 
democratic and what isn't. So then essentially

26:08.723 --> 26:12.548
you're asking the question, why was I there? And I 
think in the very end, I'll always feel the same

26:13.034 --> 26:17.000
way. I went there to honor myself as a member of the 
country, of this country. And more important to me

26:23.870 --> 26:34.747
is to honor my family as well as honor my dad, 
because I always held him with a lot of pride and a

26:23.870 --> 26:34.747
lot of feeling. He went through it. My uncles went 
through it. And between me and another cousin,

26:39.460 --> 26:43.085
that was it as far as the family was concerned. And 
hopefully nobody else will ever have to go. But

26:46.069 --> 26:50.275
here again, our present conditions don't warrant 
that. And it's highly probable that we're going to

26:51.436 --> 26:55.622
find border confrontations real soon. And I just 
hope that our foreign policy will always remember

26:56.804 --> 27:06.497
those trying years and use all of that history to 
reinvent to not recreate what essentially was our

27:07.844 --> 27:12.216
problem in Vietnam. I hope I've just been helpful. 
Sure. Everything will help. Thank you very much.

27:21.580 --> 27:22.944
Okay. Good day.
