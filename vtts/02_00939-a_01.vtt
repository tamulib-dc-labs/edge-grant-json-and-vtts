00:02.883 --> 00:12.733
As you can imagine, the cost of building a nuclear 
power plant and a coal-fired plant is extremely

00:02.883 --> 00:12.733
high on the front end. So the city is having to float 
bonds to pay for this high cost at the front end. I

00:21.821 --> 00:27.547
think with the knowledge that as you move on out 
into the future, those costs are going to be very,

00:21.821 --> 00:27.547
very low. And what we're talking about in the 
future is fuel costs. So the utility rates are

00:32.667 --> 00:34.669
high. There's no question about it. I don't have 
the detail about that, but I think we're in a good

00:36.331 --> 00:43.399
position energy-wise to take care of our 
problems. As a matter of fact, we are selling

00:43.459 --> 00:52.428
excess energy to Houston to the tune of about $16 
million a year through 1985. That helps to write

00:52.569 --> 00:59.456
off some of that initial high cost. Water. Our 
primary water source is the Colorado River, but

01:02.654 --> 01:20.419
when you get projects like Stacy Dam being 
approved upstream in the San Angelo area, we can

01:02.654 --> 01:20.419
see demands on the water becoming severe. We've 
got about 3 trillion acre feet of water above us, so

01:20.459 --> 01:26.167
we've got plenty of water. But there are going to be 
drawdowns on that upstream There are going to be

01:29.992 --> 01:38.023
demands, continued demands downstream on that 
Colorado River water as far as the rice farmers and

01:29.992 --> 01:38.023
others downstream from us.

01:41.227 --> 01:47.836
We will probably look to the Edwards Aquifer as a 
water resource in the future, as a secondary. Now,

01:48.076 --> 01:52.382
you see, the Edwards Aquifer here is not the same as 
the one San Antonio has. There's a tip in it from

01:52.422 --> 01:57.349
Buda on in. Austin, it tips in our direction. When 
you get north of the city, Edwards picks up and

02:01.111 --> 02:07.981
doesn't come into the Colorado, but tips toward 
Round Rock and Georgetown. But Round Rock, I mean,

02:09.143 --> 02:14.170
water is something that we need to look at on down 
the line. We're looking at a 2,000 population here

02:14.210 --> 02:21.240
of three-quarters of a million people in the 
metropolitan area. What is it right now, Dan, to

02:21.721 --> 02:23.083
your question? Well, the city is 350, and Travis 
County is four and a quarter. So we're talking

02:29.440 --> 02:33.644
about another 300,000 people in the county by the 
turn of the century. Where do you think most of

02:34.605 --> 02:37.107
those will locate? Well, they'll locate 
generally north, south, northwest, and

02:37.127 --> 02:40.931
southwest. But not much to the east. Not much to the 
east. And the problems are soils, geology,

02:44.254 --> 02:51.180
floodplains are very wide and very shallow. We had 
one subdivision come in of 1,500 acres of 800 acres

02:52.038 --> 02:57.906
was in a floodplain, for example, kind of thing. So 
most of it is going to be in the area that's easiest

02:59.709 --> 03:09.924
to develop, has the best access, provides the most 
opportunity for moderate cost housing. It's not

03:09.944 --> 03:11.245
going to be east or west. Water is going to be 
something we need to think about. When you

03:16.413 --> 03:17.995
consider that That increase in population moving 
to transportation now. And 98% of a million person

03:24.006 --> 03:27.949
trips a day are in cars. And consider continuing 
that percentage to 2 million person trips, 3

03:28.290 --> 03:34.835
million person trips. Yes. In spite of the cost of 
gasoline. Yes. Individual travel by some mode is

03:39.379 --> 03:42.642
going to continue. Let's just assume that we can 
change the proportion from 98.2 to 90.10 90% of two

03:51.083 --> 03:55.570
million person trips is a million eight. We've 
still got 200,000 people riding in buses, but

03:57.573 --> 04:03.823
we've got a million eight riding in some kind of a 
vehicle. When you consider that three-fourths of

04:06.146 --> 04:16.862
those trips are multipurpose trips and cannot be 
taken care of easily by a transit system, I think

04:06.146 --> 04:16.862
transportation is a very, very serious problem. 
Now, how do we deal with it? We have been

04:20.041 --> 04:28.633
encouraging employers to locate closer to 
subdivision areas so that people don't have to

04:20.041 --> 04:28.633
drive so far to work. We don't insist that they 
locate in industrial parks. That's the reason the

04:33.521 --> 04:47.961
planned development area site plan and 
industrial performance standards have been

04:33.521 --> 04:47.961
developed, so that if we get an industry to locate, 
that it does not negatively impact residential

04:33.521 --> 04:47.961
development around it. We actively encourage the 
Chamber. to do that. We've actively been

04:51.434 --> 05:12.878
encouraging the Chamber to work with Chambers and 
other small communities within 25 miles,

04:51.434 --> 05:12.878
Georgetown, Taylor, Seguin, Round Rock, San 
Marcos, Bastrop, with their Chambers of

04:51.434 --> 05:12.878
Commerce, maybe to encourage some industry to 
locate there, to build up their economic base.

05:13.860 --> 05:16.002
It's important that the region be a strongly 
economic strength, but not so much Austin has to

05:16.437 --> 05:20.903
have all that economic strength. We're not so sure 
that the CBD should be active. We are thinking that

05:27.211 --> 05:33.398
it may not be a good idea to actively support 
increased development in the CBD.

05:36.803 --> 05:36.903
Okay? Spread it around. What's happening to 
Congress Avenue? Congress Avenue is in the hands

05:40.908 --> 05:44.352
of a task force at this moment. to come up with some 
alternatives to beautification as well as

05:44.922 --> 05:52.252
handling traffic on the street. The mandate of the 
council is that the street may be continued six

05:53.033 --> 06:01.324
lanes with 45-degree parking, two-way. But in 
those plans, we have sidewalk extensions at all

06:03.006 --> 06:10.997
the intersections and tree planting. and program 
and signage program that takes care of some of the

06:11.669 --> 06:21.720
aesthetics and pedestrian comforts as one walks 
the avenue. And we're building that to see and to

06:22.841 --> 06:40.140
make sure that if the council ever wants to move to a 
phase two project, which may take parking to 30

06:22.841 --> 06:40.140
degrees and reduce lanes, that we can simply 
expand the sidewalk out to make greater room for

06:22.841 --> 06:40.140
pedestrians. to make sure that what we do in phase 
one doesn't prohibit us from moving into a second

06:40.795 --> 06:46.724
phase at some future time. What about the creek 
over here? What's its name? Waller Creek. Waller

06:53.354 --> 06:54.115
Creek? Yes. Could you describe that project? Yes. 
Waller Creek beautification is proceeding.

07:00.305 --> 07:06.955
There is some between $1 million and $2 million of 
CIP money set aside for hike and bike projects.

07:07.525 --> 07:12.449
walkways, pedestrian amenities, landscaping, 
bridge crossings. That's being done by a

07:13.190 --> 07:15.312
consulting firm? The plan was done by a consulting 
firm. Which firm was it? It was a firm out of Dallas.

07:21.518 --> 07:21.898
Dahlberg? Yeah. Myron Dahlberg. And the Parks and 
Recreation Department is now implementing the

07:25.221 --> 07:28.404
program. It will include at some time a flood 
bypass through the center part of the city And what

07:36.112 --> 07:43.343
will occur then along the creek is much like 
something like San Antonio, except not quite as

07:36.112 --> 07:43.343
significant. There will be some structures 
placed in the creek to provide for ponding rather

07:43.763 --> 07:50.052
than stormwater. And that will be from about 10th 
Street down to about 3rd Street, the flood bypass,

07:50.974 --> 08:03.452
so that in that business area, one can build a 
business and back it up to the creek and then open it

07:50.974 --> 08:03.452
up to the creek and things like that. Very good. But 
the first phase is primarily hike and bike trail

08:04.306 --> 08:11.840
from the university area, capital area, down to 
the lake. And then it'll join the existing hike and

08:11.860 --> 08:13.904
bike trail. At the lake, right. Very good. That's 
it. All right. Thank you very much, Dick. You're

08:21.879 --> 08:22.180
welcome. This is going to make a primary 
contribution toward the volume, I'm sure. Well, I

08:26.838 --> 08:30.365
appreciate the opportunity that you give me to 
talk to you about it. And call me, Bob, whenever, if

08:30.505 --> 08:40.005
something comes up, questions that you need 
answered maybe that we didn't cover or something

08:30.505 --> 08:40.005
that you want to cover that wasn't on the list. Just 
give me a call. Thank you very much. Okay.

09:02.596 --> 09:04.219
This is January 9, 1981. We're at the residence of 
Professor Kevin Stowers of St. Edward's

09:04.820 --> 09:10.689
University. And we're going to pick up from our 
conversation yesterday. Today, it will be

09:14.816 --> 09:20.546
oriented toward the city of Austin rather than 
Galveston. So Kevin,

09:22.048 --> 09:29.160
there are some questions that probably don't 
apply as directly in the case of Austin and your

09:29.579 --> 09:38.935
views of it because you're not an agency director 
here as you were in Galveston. But if you'd like to

09:40.157 --> 09:46.508
just go through those and comment as you feel 
comfortable doing so, that would be a great job.

09:46.588 --> 09:52.178
Well, let me begin by first by saying that I would 
feel more comfortable in the case of Austin taking

09:46.588 --> 09:52.178
a broader view of the overall sense of 
development, because I'm sure there are a lot of

09:52.732 --> 10:06.455
details and ins and outs and, in many cases, 
personalities that I am not as familiar with as I

09:52.732 --> 10:06.455
would be in, say, other communities where I've 
directly worked. And many of these documents and

10:06.896 --> 10:09.741
dates we've already documented. And I'm sure that 
you've documented many of those. I think Austin is

10:12.506 --> 10:18.115
interesting as a community in a planning sense 
because It's been at the game for a very long time

10:18.567 --> 10:22.110
for this part of the country. I'm sure you know that 
the first major comprehensive plan in the

10:23.191 --> 10:34.581
community was adopted, Modern Plan, in 1928, 
which places it really in the forefront of modern

10:23.191 --> 10:34.581
planning efforts. And at the same time, the city of 
Austin has spent, on a per capita basis, a

10:35.062 --> 10:48.574
relatively large amount of money on recreational 
development, planning efforts, engineering,

10:35.062 --> 10:48.574
public works, and so forth. I think it shows in 
comparison to many other cities. And the quality

10:53.986 --> 10:57.931
of what we have reflects that. So from that reason, 
I'm particularly interested in what I would call

10:58.772 --> 11:09.866
kind of the transitional phase when Austin really 
began to grow in the 1960s and 70s. And some of the

11:10.347 --> 11:18.257
things that I see happening in the future is the 
general growth in the Sun Belt has blossomed with a

11:10.347 --> 11:18.257
lot of migration into the Sun Belt in Austin and 
certainly the other parts of the South. So going

11:24.107 --> 11:35.276
that direction, although I would like to say that 
historically, Austin was a planned community

11:24.107 --> 11:35.276
also. It was planned. It was laid out on a grid 
system. The capital, interestingly enough, was

11:38.199 --> 11:48.548
located precisely so that its steps were at the 
base of the 100-year flood plain of the Colorado

11:38.199 --> 11:48.548
River. So this capital was not located in the 
center of the community, as you might

11:49.169 --> 11:55.057
traditionally expect. But with waterborne 
transportation, you find that a lot of the retail

11:55.678 --> 12:11.380
and warehousing development, commercial 
development, occurred between the capital and

11:55.678 --> 12:11.380
the river itself, where the risk of the periodic 
flood was certainly worth the technological

12:11.832 --> 12:19.619
difficulties of moving commodities and goods 
from the river to the warehouses to be sold to

12:11.832 --> 12:19.619
consumers. And so you can see a historical 
development there that's continued through this

12:20.900 --> 12:25.965
time. And the street system largely is dependent 
very much on the physiography and terrain. It

12:31.610 --> 12:39.257
reflects how Austin related to areas outside of 
the region, other cities, communities, its

12:31.610 --> 12:39.257
transportation system. And a lot of what we see 
happening today continues on that historical

12:40.013 --> 12:49.326
tradition that was laid down when Austin was laid 
out. As I mentioned, the Capitol is located as a

12:49.846 --> 12:56.035
very valuable and central piece of property up out 
of the floodplain. It was interesting that the

12:56.435 --> 13:08.552
first state prison was located right down on the 
river, right next to it, where if there was a good

12:56.435 --> 13:08.552
flood, it would certainly save the taxpayers a 
little money in the next fiscal year. which is kind

13:08.802 --> 13:11.525
of an interesting philosophy. But I think that you 
can begin to see how people in that period treated

13:11.605 --> 13:21.615
physical development and land uses. The south 
side of the town, which is perhaps the one I'm most

13:22.235 --> 13:38.792
interested in because of some interns I've been 
working with and neighborhood associations, as

13:22.235 --> 13:38.792
well as just the fact that it seems to be where 
things are beginning to happen in a big way, as well

13:22.235 --> 13:38.792
as St. Edward's being located in the south side. It 
was very late in developing historically. Part of

13:43.021 --> 13:46.465
it is simply the barriers to transportation 
formed by the river. And I don't know if you've had a

13:47.367 --> 13:51.172
chance to examine the 1928 plan. Not yet. Dick 
Lilly has copies of all of them in the library. OK. I

13:56.399 --> 14:03.970
was going to say, also, if they did not maintain 
copies, the Austin-Travis County collection at

14:04.608 --> 14:08.133
the public library downtown, right next to the 
brand new library. The old library maintains a

14:08.153 --> 14:16.085
complete collection of all municipal documents, 
memorandums, minutes of meetings. So in the case

14:16.706 --> 14:24.397
of Austin, we have a very good historical record as 
opposed to Galveston and perhaps many other

14:16.706 --> 14:24.397
communities. So that is a resource that would 
certainly be worth you know, exploring and

14:30.308 --> 14:32.170
pursuing. And there are reprints available of 
some of these maps and aerial views and

14:32.410 --> 14:44.605
perspectives of the city through different 
periods of time beginning in the 1830s moving

14:32.410 --> 14:44.605
forward to the modern period. And I think that kind 
of illustration is helpful. Very interesting to

14:47.609 --> 14:49.110
include. And so that would certainly be one thing 
that I would be looking for forward to including.

14:57.400 --> 14:59.843
Kevin, I asked Dick Lilly. In summary, a question 
that I'd like to ask you. Could you take a look at

15:04.965 --> 15:28.547
Austin as a whole and at this point in time, which 
seems to be somewhat critical in terms of Austin's

15:04.965 --> 15:28.547
development, enumerate maybe very few principle 
problems that face Austin from a planning point of

15:04.965 --> 15:28.547
view? What opportunities do you see, perhaps, on 
the horizon for Austin?

15:36.055 --> 15:48.968
Well,

15:36.055 --> 15:48.968
I guess I've been kind of optimistic, or I've just 
been looking at things happening, because I

15:36.055 --> 15:48.968
haven't really named problems in the way I've been 
looking at Austin and thinking about it.

15:49.068 --> 15:56.155
Certainly, I think Austin, unlike a lot of 
communities in Texas and perhaps across the

15:49.068 --> 15:56.155
United States, is in the position of having 
opportunities, and perhaps more opportunities

15:56.641 --> 16:08.331
than they have problems, which is kind of an 
encouraging difference from a lot of communities

15:56.641 --> 16:08.331
I've worked with and been associated with. In 
fact, there seem to be so many more strengths that

16:09.973 --> 16:18.280
you're not in the situation of running around with 
a fire bucket trying to put out emergencies. Now, I

16:18.881 --> 16:25.146
think if you're on city staff in a city like Austin, 
it seems like they're all emergencies, but in

16:18.881 --> 16:25.146
reality, In many cases, it's opportunities. We 
can talk about things that are happening in Austin

16:28.614 --> 16:37.707
that have real planning significance by the 
dozens. And I would include things like rapid

16:37.928 --> 16:40.652
growth. You certainly have a very rapid growth in 
population occurring in Austin. It's moving from

16:44.558 --> 16:53.952
being one of the nice, small, medium, quite state 
capitals with the state university located

16:44.558 --> 16:53.952
therein to being a major city. If our population 
projections are accurate, and they've been

16:57.156 --> 17:15.434
pretty well right on up to this point, we would 
expect to see conceivably the city of Austin being

16:57.156 --> 17:15.434
the size of Dallas or larger by the year 2000, which 
is mind-boggling right now. Indeed. Yes. Do you

17:17.356 --> 17:19.298
think the infrastructure could handle that? 
Well, that's one of the potential problems.

17:26.413 --> 17:31.961
I'm not so quite as concerned about the 
infrastructure in this case as I am about the

17:26.413 --> 17:31.961
environment. Because if you begin looking at the 
physical environmental limitations of Austin,

17:32.062 --> 17:38.892
it's a remarkable site. And that's one of the 
things that makes it attractive. You're in a

17:41.096 --> 17:46.905
transition zone, really, between three major 
plant community ecosystem groups. You're

17:47.476 --> 18:03.992
transitioning from the rolling hill country, 
basically cedar breaks, limestone hills,

17:47.476 --> 18:03.992
aquifer recharge areas down into the Texas 
coastal plain, heavy clay soils to the north, farm

17:47.476 --> 18:03.992
communities. And you've got a tremendous 
divergency. There's a tremendous number of

18:06.894 --> 18:09.297
creeks. It's an extremely wet, viable, 
complicated area. The terrain is hilly. It's

18:16.274 --> 18:16.955
rolling. It breaks sharply. This particular 
house is located virtually at the edge of the

18:19.198 --> 18:23.765
Balcones Fault. You can go less than a mile or so to 
the west, and suddenly you're into the hill

18:25.668 --> 18:31.937
country. You go a couple of three miles to the east, 
and you're suddenly on flat, heavy clay soils.

18:41.257 --> 18:49.630
This makes a big difference in the way things have 
got to happen if we're going to retain the kind of

18:41.257 --> 18:49.630
environmental character that we care for. Now, we 
don't have much of an air pollution problem in

18:49.670 --> 18:53.716
Austin, and we probably won't. Do you think the 
environmental character can be maintained with

18:53.977 --> 18:57.643
that many people at it? Well, I think that's going 
to be very difficult to do. I haven't sat down with a

19:04.473 --> 19:09.441
pen and pencil and done any calculations. I think 
that conceivably, just looking at the map in terms

19:09.758 --> 19:25.084
of the areas that it would be possible to build in 
without having some sort of environmental

19:09.758 --> 19:25.084
trade-offs, that we can certainly probably 
double the population without increasing

19:09.758 --> 19:25.084
density. That's just mapping the area and saying, 
okay, where are floodplains or recharge areas,

19:25.655 --> 19:36.387
areas which show soil limitations for 
construction, steep slopes, the traditional

19:25.655 --> 19:36.387
things. So, yeah, we can grow a lot. The only 
question, of course, is where, in fact, are we

19:39.911 --> 19:44.175
going to be growing? That's one problem. The 
infrastructure to support that growth gets a

19:47.399 --> 19:54.767
little bit complex because it seems like, for 
various reasons, We are not growing really the

19:55.102 --> 20:02.312
directions that would be most environmentally 
acceptable. And we don't seem to be really north

20:02.973 --> 20:10.904
and south, and what has been determined to be the 
growth corridor. And

20:12.206 --> 20:16.753
could you stop the tape? Excuse me. As I was saying, 
which would be really north and south, Also, the

20:22.557 --> 20:30.729
real temptation and desirable areas from those 
who can afford to buy houses today is to move into

20:22.557 --> 20:30.729
the hill country. It's very attractive, 
beautiful views, nice area to live in. Certainly,

20:34.294 --> 20:37.719
that's where anybody with class and taste wants to 
live. And they would like to look at the

20:37.779 --> 20:41.144
unblemished hillside across from them. But of 
course, people want to buy on that unblemished

20:41.164 --> 20:45.170
hillside across from them. And then they're upset 
when they look out and see their neighbor's roofs

20:45.210 --> 20:52.480
and backyards and patios and so forth. All of this 
compounds into tremendous erosion and runoff

20:52.949 --> 20:57.374
problems. The cost of servicing the area is very 
high from a lift station standpoint, road

20:57.774 --> 21:03.300
maintenance. The number of lots that you can get in 
with any degree of efficiency is very limited. So

21:10.948 --> 21:20.678
you're talking about a lower density consuming 
much larger amounts of land and probably with

21:10.948 --> 21:20.678
fairly great trade-offs going East, which is a 
flat area, you wind up with some... He's a friendly

21:25.416 --> 21:28.120
cat.

21:30.504 --> 21:31.425
I'll try to stroke you.

21:34.670 --> 21:46.768
So anyway, you go east, you wind up with some 
trade-offs in terms of having a major Air Force

21:34.670 --> 21:46.768
base over there with rather loud jets flying over 
that just rattle your windows and drive you

21:34.670 --> 21:46.768
absolutely crazy. You wind up with... rather 
heavy clay soils, some shrink-swell problems

21:49.818 --> 21:55.285
similar to College Station and Bryan. You wind up 
with limitations in terms of the structures and

21:56.927 --> 22:02.714
type of structures to build. You're getting into 
prime agricultural soils. And again, there are

22:06.278 --> 22:09.703
some trade-offs there that create problems. What 
about transportation? With a doubling or a

22:12.046 --> 22:18.053
tripling of the population, do you see anything in 
store for that? Oh, I think just basically

22:18.758 --> 22:21.000
catastrophe. I don't think that there's adequate 
funding available, and I don't look for it to

22:22.902 --> 22:42.258
become available any time in the near future to do 
the kind of massive development activities,

22:22.902 --> 22:42.258
either in terms of mass transit or highway funding 
that would be necessary to sustain that level of

22:22.902 --> 22:42.258
growth. I think transportation is probably going 
to be one of the critical infrastructure factors

22:42.339 --> 22:47.483
that will limit development in this and many other 
cities in the United States. And the outcome, of

22:53.364 --> 23:05.698
course, is that in a city like Austin, we 
essentially have only one major corridor

22:53.364 --> 23:05.698
north-south. That's IH 35, which is essentially 
at capacity. It backs up in traffic jams for about

23:08.861 --> 23:17.571
an hour and a half or so during rush hour, two hours 
during rush hour, every day if you happen to be on

23:08.861 --> 23:17.571
it. from 7 to 8 in the morning or from about 4 to 6 
o'clock, particularly trying to get across the

23:17.804 --> 23:24.093
Colorado River. Trying to cross the river going 
north to south is a very difficult proposition. We

23:29.740 --> 23:34.527
have a fairly large number of bridges, but there's 
a lot of movement back and forth. And that exceeds

23:35.028 --> 23:39.494
the capacity of those bridges during rush hour. 
Now, certainly this isn't the level or magnitude

23:39.514 --> 23:45.482
of problem that parts of Dallas or Houston is 
facing. But on the other hand, there aren't many

23:45.918 --> 23:52.867
places in the United States that have that level of 
magnitude or level of problem. What Austin is

23:52.887 --> 23:57.653
facing is the prospect of beginning to have that 
level of problem. Mopac Expressway has been

23:57.673 --> 24:05.523
built, at least in the north portion, but it 
doesn't really alleviate anything. We have three

24:05.564 --> 24:12.853
major roads in the city of Austin, 183, Ben White, 
and IH 35, that have horrible accident rates. The

24:13.255 --> 24:29.893
development pattern on 183 and Ben White has 
stripped development of the worst type with no

24:13.255 --> 24:29.893
control of access whatsoever, tremendous 
turning movements, U-turns, a large number of

24:13.255 --> 24:29.893
driveways per facility. And this just compounds 
the problem. And there's no acceleration or

24:33.257 --> 24:35.839
deacceleration lanes. There's a narrow 
right-of-way. The land is extremely expensive.

24:40.104 --> 24:42.807
And any attempt to alleviate the congestion 
increasing the facility or its size is going to

24:43.394 --> 25:09.334
wind up with some real difficulties real expenses 
that are probably beyond the ability of the

24:43.394 --> 25:09.334
highway department or the city to undertake are 
the city's development standards adequate it

24:43.394 --> 25:09.334
makes one me question whether they are or not if ben 
white for example has as many problems i would say

24:43.394 --> 25:09.334
that there's a real imbalance between city land 
development standards, commercial development

25:09.922 --> 25:19.513
standards, as they apply to street capacity and 
street design in the city of Austin. I'm not sure if

25:19.693 --> 25:28.022
it's a problem with the standards or some 
historical things that have happened or a lack of

25:19.693 --> 25:28.022
controls. I think there are some problems there. 
And I haven't looked at it well enough to know what

25:31.767 --> 25:34.630
the problem is. But allowing a 183 and a to happen, 
And having those types of land use controls that

25:39.301 --> 25:46.068
would permit that kind of traffic situation to 
happen indicates some real problems. Now, I don't

25:46.108 --> 25:53.096
know if the problems in the urban city 
transportation department are in terms of the

25:46.108 --> 25:53.096
inability to control zoning. Zoning is another 
issue that's interesting in Austin, because

25:53.596 --> 26:03.046
right now they're in the process, or they may have, 
they're still in the process of trying to adopt a

25:53.596 --> 26:03.046
new zoning ordinance. I don't know if that's been 
mentioned to you or not. Yes, it has.

26:09.170 --> 26:15.368
Glover, who is actually doing the design of the 
ordinance now, we're in the same class at

26:09.170 --> 26:15.368
Berkeley. Yeah, very good. There might be hope. 
Yes, he's very good, very pleasant guy. I think

26:23.902 --> 26:28.850
that that's part of the problem, and I think the 
city recognizes the land use controls have got

26:23.902 --> 26:28.850
problems. They don't like to come out and say those 
things too directly. It doesn't do them much good

26:34.079 --> 26:39.207
politically or otherwise to say that they've got a 
real catastrophe on their hands. But the

26:39.268 --> 26:40.449
ordinance is an old one. It was apparently adopted 
many decades ago. I think about 54. Yeah. I was

26:44.837 --> 26:48.002
going to say 48 or 54, somewhere in there. And it was 
copied from the standard ordinances that were

26:48.235 --> 26:53.045
being written in the 30s and 40s. Exactly. And in 
the 20s. And in the 20s, for that matter. And it just

26:56.933 --> 26:58.877
compounded a lot of problems. There's a lot of land 
that's mis-zoned for all practical purposes.

27:06.055 --> 27:07.437
causes a lot of turmoil. It doesn't tend to 
stabilize neighborhoods. You see a lot of

27:09.400 --> 27:16.129
neighborhoods in change and fluctuation simply 
because the land is somewhat inappropriately

27:09.400 --> 27:16.129
zoned. It's terribly complex when you start 
changing a zoning ordinance in a comprehensive

27:16.169 --> 27:25.341
way to get the thing passed because there are so 
many people that have so much to lose. So I

27:25.401 --> 27:28.105
sympathize with that.

27:31.349 --> 27:34.273
Mopac, if it is finished, and it will be, and 
extended across the river. To Ravenswood, is it?

27:42.178 --> 27:43.319
Well, past Barton Square. I can't remember where 
it ends now. But when it's extended across the

27:47.142 --> 27:50.665
river, it's going to do some things. And it's 
interesting that we're talking about this,

27:50.745 --> 28:04.497
because about three months ago, I had a student 
that was working for one of the neighborhood

27:50.745 --> 28:04.497
associations ask me what seemed to be the most 
dramatic kinds of things that affected

27:50.745 --> 28:04.497
development in South Austin. And I pointed to what 
I thought were two decisions that were made really

28:04.696 --> 28:24.186
back in the early 60s, and in some cases actually 
going back 30 and 40 years, although certain

28:04.696 --> 28:24.186
people don't like you to know that those decisions 
were made 30 and 40 years ago, that tremendously

28:04.696 --> 28:24.186
impacted South Austin. One was the cleaning up of 
Town Lake, changing it from a sewer to a fairly

28:25.288 --> 28:32.239
decent linear park system. which, you know, I 
don't argue with, but at the same time, that

28:32.270 --> 28:40.660
changed the character and the type of investment 
that's going to be attracted to it. Suddenly,

28:41.315 --> 28:52.066
instead of it being small shops and stores and 
neighborhood service facilities, you're

28:41.315 --> 28:52.066
beginning to look at some people that might be 
interested in building major hotels or

28:41.315 --> 28:52.066
convention centers. And sure enough, that's 
exactly what's happening once the population

28:52.106 --> 29:02.616
mass and the activities level got to a point that 
suddenly people were interested in that kind of

28:52.106 --> 29:02.616
investment. No one's mentioned this before. 
Well, once it's there and the population enlarges

29:05.800 --> 29:11.305
to a certain critical point, And you've got a 
beautiful park facility, a water relationship.

29:15.052 --> 29:17.976
And it's close into downtown, into governmental 
centers. And you're within, really, 10 minutes of

29:18.076 --> 29:20.979
the Capitol. And in reality, you're not that far 
from the University of Texas. Of course, that's

29:27.427 --> 29:30.070
very logical. And you look at it, it's old, junky 
facilities that are run down. And you've got, in

29:34.496 --> 29:41.224
many cases, people that acquired the land and put 
it together because they thought possibly

29:34.496 --> 29:41.224
something was going to happen. And sure enough, 
you wind up with convention type hotels going in.

29:44.692 --> 29:53.082
And this wipes out several blocks of relatively 
moderate income housing and lower scale

29:44.692 --> 29:53.082
commercial development. This wrecks all kinds of 
havoc on the ensuing neighborhoods down to Ben

29:53.102 --> 30:00.550
White because it kind of has a rippling effect. And 
another thing that is impacting was the decision

30:00.670 --> 30:09.220
to build Mopac as an expressway, a west loop. The 
decision was first kind of pinned out by some

30:09.487 --> 30:17.543
anonymous bureaucrat in the highway department 
40 years ago, if I can believe what I've been told.

30:18.605 --> 30:22.452
He kind of looks at it and says, well, let's see what 
this looks like. And of course, from an

30:22.532 --> 30:26.560
engineering standpoint, it was not an 
unreasonable decision. You follow the railroad

30:26.620 --> 30:28.103
grade. Railroad engineers weren't stupid. They 
followed the easy way in and out of places. And it

30:32.918 --> 30:34.560
kind of made some sense. And you didn't catch 
anybody's house that was too important. But

30:38.003 --> 30:45.731
unfortunately, it was close enough for Smilin, 
Ralph Yarborough, and a few other illustrious

30:38.003 --> 30:45.731
accolades of Texas politics to hear the noise. And 
there's been no end to the complaints ever since.

30:49.755 --> 30:51.316
And it became a political issue. And of course, 
people sometimes use these things advance their

30:55.117 --> 30:58.783
own interests, particularly if they're very 
powerful or influential politicians.

30:59.944 --> 31:06.354
Interestingly enough, the sound barrier that 
they put up on Mopac is totally ineffective. All it

31:07.216 --> 31:17.572
did was create a psychological feeling, a visible 
manifestation that the government agency was

31:07.216 --> 31:17.572
responsive and that the sound has been listened. 
Actually, the sound levels, if you measure them,

31:17.652 --> 31:21.057
are well within Normally acceptable levels, as 
established by the EPA, are any other group that

31:21.509 --> 31:28.160
you want to utilize. There is no sound pollution 
problem on Mopac in terms of residential

31:28.241 --> 31:33.970
adjoining land uses. However, it was a nice 
political issue. It created a lot of neighborhood

31:36.455 --> 31:43.146
backlash, and there were certain outs that wished 
they were in politically.
