WEBVTT

00:01.347 --> 00:14.183
You

00:01.347 --> 00:14.183
mentioned that, say, a fish had a stripe on his arm 
as a sort of mark of, you know, a white stripe is a

00:01.347 --> 00:14.183
mark of identification. That's right. But that 
was totally unnecessary. Did the upperclassmen

00:16.366 --> 00:23.235
have marks of identity or stripes identifying 
them as a particular? Of course, the sophomore had

00:23.255 --> 00:27.540
corporal stripes if he was a, fed class if it was a 
classified sophomore he got corporal stripes

00:28.550 --> 00:56.886
which made quite an occasion when you got your 
corporal stripes seemed like everybody on campus

00:28.550 --> 00:56.886
tried to haze them it's also true when a sergeant 
got his sergeant stripes and i never was around

00:28.550 --> 00:56.886
when the seniors got their boots but

00:28.550 --> 00:56.886
i'm sure that there was some kind of ceremony that 
the rvs at the time i was there were

00:59.684 --> 01:02.207
seemed to haze more than anyone else. It almost

01:02.648 --> 01:12.600
discouraged you from wanting to be in an RV to see 
the way they initiated their neophytes. A

01:14.061 --> 01:22.231
sophomore's uniform was plain outside the 
stripes. Freshman's uniform was plain, outside

01:24.440 --> 01:28.685
the white fish stripe. The sophomores was outside 
of the corporal stripes. And the juniors was more

01:34.051 --> 01:36.593
or less the same thing. They usually had a little 
bit better uniform, a little bit better, they had

01:36.614 --> 01:43.882
bought some of their uniform. And of course the 
seniors had their boots. And the seniors were

01:47.105 --> 01:52.071
allowed to wear trousers.

01:52.091 --> 01:54.193
We weren't, the freshmen wore leggings

01:55.338 --> 02:00.657
and of course in his cavalry they wore uh uh former 
leggings that weren't wrapped leggings we were

02:01.295 --> 02:30.036
kind of envious of them for that fact they didn't 
get up that early we thought we soon learned that we

02:01.295 --> 02:30.036
could wrap them in about two or three minutes where 
it used to take us 30 and 40 minutes when we first got

02:01.295 --> 02:30.036
there well was that that was part of your 
inspection though i suppose if you're like if your

02:01.295 --> 02:30.036
patees weren't wrapped right well that's right 
you get a ram for that that's right we sure did not

02:01.295 --> 02:30.036
i've forgotten about the rams did they uh when you 
were there did they still read the ram list in the at

02:01.295 --> 02:30.036
supper yes sir And the freshman, I don't know what, 
you picked up your, when he called attention, you

02:30.792 --> 02:45.599
picked up your knife and you threw it forward and 
pulled it back to you for inspection. If it had

02:45.959 --> 02:47.743
butter on it, well, that's all the better. You can 
throw the butter at the sophomore across the

02:47.763 --> 02:49.947
table. Kind of give him an excuse to, of course, 
he'd see you later about that. And every time he

02:55.143 --> 02:58.306
would call a name, then you would repeat that 
process. You'd throw your knife forward and bring

02:58.346 --> 03:04.111
it back towards you in a kind of a salute.

03:05.172 --> 03:09.396
It made, of all the 2,300, not that many freshmen. I 
think there was, I can't even say, I'm going to say

03:09.476 --> 03:16.083
this thousand freshman year I was there, but I do 
not know. It was probably about that many if there

03:16.103 --> 03:18.285
were 2,300. Anyway, when a thousand freshmen hit 
the table with their knives and come up and saluted

03:18.305 --> 03:23.850
with their, A forever name is called out in the mess 
hall. A little noisy out there. It's a little

03:30.406 --> 03:31.587
noisy. I believe that it was the noisiest place I 
have ever been in my life was a mess hall the first

03:31.667 --> 03:38.896
time until you get used to it. What did you do for 
entertainment and recreation?

03:48.687 --> 03:53.012
I know they occasionally had dances, but I don't 
know whether the freshmen were allowed to go to

03:48.687 --> 03:53.012
them. No, the freshmen weren't allowed to go, not 
until the latter part of the year. I don't know.

04:01.503 --> 04:09.312
You, a freshman, becomes pretty well acquainted 
at the YMCA, at the Y. I spent a lot of time playing

04:09.680 --> 04:14.587
dominoes over there, and it was swimming. I 
believe the pool tables were always big. Probably

04:18.613 --> 04:22.960
a freshman would have been very fortunate to have 
gotten one. At the time, I wasn't much of a pool

04:22.980 --> 04:26.625
shark.

04:31.938 --> 04:35.188
It's my memory. Of course, the most present year of 
my life was my freshman year at Texas A&M

04:35.950 --> 04:41.948
University.

04:43.160 --> 04:45.323
You had athletic events to go to. We had athletic 
events. As I say, there was always something going

04:46.865 --> 04:50.329
on on one side of the campus or another. Did you 
individually participate in any of the

04:50.349 --> 04:56.217
intramural athletics? I went out for freshman 
basketball and freshman baseball. Now, this was

05:02.545 --> 05:04.988
for the college team. That was for the college 
team. I know I wasn't on any of the intramural. On

05:09.413 --> 05:11.056
account of that, I wasn't on the intramural. 
Intramurals are company. That's right. The

05:13.349 --> 05:14.190
company knows, sir. I don't know any of that. You 
didn't go into that. OK. Did the

05:17.593 --> 05:31.948
men who were, and this is kind of a little bit 
redundant, but I'll ask it anyway, the cadet

05:17.593 --> 05:31.948
officers have any special privileges? That would 
be mostly, I take it, seniors and juniors. I mean,

05:36.653 --> 05:43.120
say, did a senior who was a major have privileges 
that a senior private didn't have? I'm sure they

05:51.166 --> 05:55.854
did, but I didn't know of it. We often said that the 
junior, you'd rather be a junior at Texas A&M

05:57.377 --> 06:07.234
University than any other class because they seem 
to not have too many duties. And they were a little

06:07.754 --> 06:12.882
bit above all the childish stuff of a freshman and a 
sophomore. And they almost came and went as they

06:13.142 --> 06:20.353
wanted to. And outside of the first sergeant, I 
don't remember, and the sergeants on the staff, of

06:20.974 --> 06:31.990
course the senior officers came and went as they 
desired. Did you have any favorite instructors

06:32.628 --> 06:35.012
while you were there? Yes, my favorite instructor 
was D.B. Cofer in English, and of course we called

06:38.357 --> 06:54.321
him Dusty, not to his face, and he and I had the 
privilege of years later, when my son was at Texas

06:38.357 --> 06:54.321
A&M, meeting Dusty and getting to reminisce quite 
a bit. One of the disappointments of my life, about

06:54.762 --> 06:58.247
15 years after I was out of college, I was I met D.B. 
Cofer on the campus there, and he didn't even

07:02.512 --> 07:06.718
remember me, and I was pretty well disappointed in 
that. Of course, he'd probably seen 15,000 or

07:07.078 --> 07:11.965
20,000 boys since then. But I even think he had some 
influence on my life. Okay. What did the students

07:18.254 --> 07:23.160
as a whole... Oh, I must tell you about Tom 
Harrington. Tom Harrington was my fish chemistry

07:24.022 --> 07:27.386
teacher. The third day I came to... class in fish 
chemistry. I had made a B under Pop Koenig, a

07:32.970 --> 07:46.451
beloved chemistry teacher, but I'm sure he wasn't 
the hardest man that ever taught fish chemistry.

07:46.832 --> 07:52.060
The third day I was in fish chemistry class in my 
second semester was under Tom Harrington. Tom

07:52.961 --> 07:54.764
Harrington said, Fish Ansley? Only he said, Mr. 
Ansley. This class doesn't seem to be doing you any

07:57.931 --> 08:02.138
good, and you don't seem to be doing any good. I 
believe if I were you, I'd drop it. So I dropped it.

08:07.728 --> 08:12.195
And Tom Harrington was right, of course. I never 
dreamed that he'd be someday, he'd be the

08:12.957 --> 08:22.673
chancellor of the college, the president of the 
college, and we got to be great friends in later

08:12.957 --> 08:22.673
life. Tom's still alive. Yeah, he's still alive. 
And he got to know my boy and one of the thrills of my

08:27.013 --> 08:37.046
life is... As a matter of fact, they just dedicated 
the Harrington Education Center this last

08:27.013 --> 08:37.046
spring. That's right. I opened the elevator once 
at the Hilton in Dallas and there was a man and...

08:44.978 --> 08:46.579
started off the elevator and said, I know you. 
You're Charles Ansley's daddy, which that Tom

08:46.619 --> 08:54.106
Harrington would know my son who was with Texas 
A&M. I appreciated that from Tom for coming to

08:54.126 --> 08:56.408
town. He'd know who I was in that way. What was the 
attitude of the students to the administration?

09:02.673 --> 09:05.336
And I guess probably you had a dual 
administration, didn't you? You had a president

09:05.356 --> 09:11.761
in charge of the education and the commandant in 
charge of the discipline, so to speak. Well, of

09:12.762 --> 09:14.023
course, Dr. Brazell was the president, and I got to 
know him. We got in a little scrape over thinking

09:22.130 --> 09:34.307
the yell leader was drunk, and Dr. Brazell wanted 
us to explain that, and he was just that old side,

09:22.130 --> 09:34.307
which was just acting crazy. But anyway, by casual 
remark, it got back to Dr. Brazell. I got to know Dr.

09:39.738 --> 09:45.205
Brazell real well, and I even knew him in later life 
at Oklahoma University and Colorado University.

09:45.826 --> 09:50.832
And his front door was always open to everybody. 
And one of the things that he told, he's walking

09:51.093 --> 09:59.063
down, he told this in Sunday morning, not mass what 
do we bible class no he taught a bible class yes i

10:00.140 --> 10:25.911
know but this we went to we were marched to church 
what did uh mass no what is it called devotion no not

10:00.140 --> 10:25.911
devotion probably well we marched to church every 
sunday and one morning he told about he had learned

10:00.140 --> 10:25.911
something since he'd been texting him he said he's 
walking down military walk the other night or the

10:00.140 --> 10:25.911
night before And he got too close to one of those 
buildings, and he got a GI can full of water. And he

10:31.428 --> 10:36.795
said he'd learned not to walk too close to 
buildings. And he was a lovable character and a

10:36.815 --> 10:39.538
great man. So you marched to church. Was that in 
what, Guyon Hall? Guyon Hall, in Guyon Hall. I

10:47.268 --> 10:47.849
don't know. And we sat in our companies. And it was 
hot. This was before the day of air conditioning,

10:54.143 --> 10:57.166
and it was crowded. Probably the day before. But we 
had lots of

10:58.627 --> 11:08.457
real speakers, people of note. I can't tell you one 
right now, but at the time there wasn't any

11:09.038 --> 11:18.567
small-time people that we had to speak to us. 
Chapel, it's called Chapel. They went up to

11:20.128 --> 11:21.049
Chapel. I couldn't. The military was known as 
Colonel Todd. Colonel C.C. Todd, I believe was his

11:27.447 --> 11:33.653
name, was a commandant at Texas A&M when I was 
there. As a matter of fact, in my annual, I noticed

11:33.673 --> 11:38.557
kind of a takeoff on it. It's called College 
Station Toddville, Texas. And in a lot of ways, he

11:42.161 --> 11:47.326
did kind of run the whole campus, or we thought he 
did. I don't know that I ever had any brushes with

11:48.147 --> 11:53.712
Colonel Todd. Do

11:54.080 --> 12:02.801
you remember whether there were any girls in any of 
the classes when you were there? Yes, we had.

12:07.271 --> 12:09.777
I'm thinking there were 17 girls. Or 34 girls. I 
can't remember which at Texas A&M when I was there.

12:14.690 --> 12:17.855
Maybe it's one girl for every 34 cadets or 
something of that nature. I couldn't... What were

12:17.875 --> 12:18.957
these? Primarily faculty, children, and other 
relatives? That's right. Faculty, children, and

12:22.302 --> 12:23.724
other relatives. And I married into a family that 
were Dad Short's family. And Dad Short had two

12:30.335 --> 12:35.022
girls who went to Texas A&M in the early 20s. Dad 
Short is a former head of the Extension Department

12:35.761 --> 12:40.748
at Texas A&M University. He's a former president 
of the Ex-Students Association. And I married a

12:45.235 --> 12:53.867
sister of a Texas A&M graduate, two Texas A&M 
graduates. So I took her away from another Texas

12:55.009 --> 12:59.095
A&M graduate. It's been my life. Were there any 
girls in any of the classes you were in? I can't

13:05.384 --> 13:07.647
remember. It seemed to me as if there was one in 
mechanical drawing. Did the people who

13:12.313 --> 13:23.387
participated in what's now referred to as 
intercollegiate athletics, as opposed to, say,

13:12.313 --> 13:23.387
intramural, did they have any particular 
privileges? Oh, yes, definitely. The athletes

13:26.411 --> 13:27.452
were Even as a freshman athlete, we got to go to the 
training table, which was quite

13:28.158 --> 13:40.833
an honor and better food than an ordinary cadet 
got. And we could eat there at a little bit

13:41.274 --> 13:43.797
different hours, too. We didn't have quite the 
stringent hours that the cadets had.

13:51.426 --> 13:57.253
The incident was Mule Wilson, Fay Mule Wilson, one 
of the great

14:01.638 --> 14:06.650
football players at Texas A&M University was in 
our company. And one day he put on a uniform. Now

14:08.896 --> 14:10.359
this was when he was a junior. And he put on a 
uniform. It was the only time I ever saw him in a

14:12.605 --> 14:14.449
uniform. So they went all upper class and took him 
around and introduced him to the freshmen. Said,

14:19.961 --> 14:21.362
this is Fay Wilson. Said, he's been a member of this 
military company ever since you've been here. And

14:27.268 --> 14:32.272
I'm sure he went what we call the non-rag most of the 
time. Well, I know he did. That's the only time I

14:33.093 --> 14:36.336
ever saw him with a uniform on. And the other boys, 
some athletes, though, were of a military nature.

14:42.102 --> 14:42.242
Mm-hmm. But they had certain privileges. They had 
certain privileges. I'm going to say at Texas A&M

14:46.265 --> 14:57.819
University, the athletes are put on a pedestal. 
I'm talking about all the athletes.

15:03.786 --> 15:06.349
The other one is the military. At that time, I was 
much enamored of the military life. We sure looked

15:13.829 --> 15:19.295
up to our senior officers and company commanders. 
Did you participate in the Second World War after

15:20.916 --> 15:34.050
you... No, after the Second World War, we had a 
Sergeant B.B. Daniels, of which I'm sure someone

15:34.090 --> 15:38.314
has mentioned, and he's going around. We were out 
on maneuvers one day, and We'd sit down to rest, and

15:42.972 --> 15:52.081
we were out there in the cow pasture, and of course, 
when he'd holler, we'd throw ourselves down in the

15:42.972 --> 15:52.081
cow pasture. And it was getting a little bit rough, 
and he told us boys, he says, you think this is

15:52.101 --> 15:57.546
rough? He says, you ought to be in the war. And he 
said, you see that cigarette over there? And he had

16:02.251 --> 16:04.913
a cigarette or a snipe over there about an inch 
long. He says, I've seen the time when I've been

16:04.933 --> 16:08.817
given $25 for it. And he had told us how much hell war 
really was. So when the Second World War come

16:13.870 --> 16:18.358
along, I remembered that. And I never did, I didn't 
go volunteer to win it. So I've never. And they

16:25.773 --> 16:27.556
didn't call you to serve? No, they didn't call me. 
And I was at that awkward age. I was a little too old.

16:34.171 --> 16:35.213
For the draft. Yeah, and almost too smart to run and 
jump in. I don't mean that I was a draft dodger. I did

16:42.188 --> 16:48.501
dodge the draft, but what I'm trying to say is it 
taught me that When you finished your first year,

16:50.320 --> 16:55.426
one year at A&M, then what did you do after that? I 
went to Clarendon College. I came home and worked a

16:58.810 --> 17:01.733
while, and then I went to Clarendon College. 
That's in Clarendon, Texas? Yeah, in Clarendon,

17:03.234 --> 17:04.556
Texas. And after that, I went to, I came home, 
worked some more, and I went to school in

17:04.656 --> 17:19.753
Washington, D.C. And I learned a bit about the dry 
cleaning business, and I've been in it ever since.

17:20.510 --> 17:22.533
You say you came home and worked a while. Did you 
work for your father, or did you have some other

17:22.553 --> 17:27.038
type of employment? No, I've never worked for my 
father. That's one of the fallacies of my life. I

17:31.364 --> 17:33.546
should have, but I didn't have it. How long did he 
continue to run the Anzalee Land and Cattle

17:33.606 --> 17:37.551
Company?

17:40.335 --> 17:44.700
He ran it until he was about 80 years old, until 
about 1950. Mm-hmm. And then did somebody else in

17:47.122 --> 17:49.224
the family take it over? No, that's one of the 
fallacies of our family. None of us ever had enough

17:51.806 --> 17:56.070
sense to take it up where he left off. Nobody knew 
the business at that point. Well, no, we didn't

17:58.593 --> 18:02.877
have enough sense to, I guess.

18:05.759 --> 18:11.685
I think that most children don't like to follow 
their father's footsteps. There's something bad

18:11.725 --> 18:14.968
about it, which is untrue, but When did you first 
get into the cleaning business? Labor Day, 1926,

18:19.357 --> 18:22.741
and I had an older brother. This was in the oil boom 
in Amarillo, Texas. He was a routman, and they were

18:28.688 --> 18:37.238
making fabulous money at that time, and I wanted 
some of that easy money. That's picking up laundry

18:38.440 --> 18:41.804
to bring in to be cleaned and then delivered again. 
That's right, and that's how I got into it. Went to

18:45.425 --> 18:49.973
school and learned the business, and that's, I've 
stayed in it since then. I'm now in politics. I

18:51.115 --> 18:52.617
don't know whether you want that on there or not. 
Oh, certainly. About five or six years ago, I ran

18:54.821 --> 19:06.641
for county commissioner, and this place, the man 
had been in office 35 years, and I've been in it ever

18:54.821 --> 19:06.641
since. What is your function then as a county 
commissioner? I don't, we're no different, I'm no

19:11.075 --> 19:22.052
different than any other of the 254 county 
commission, counties in Texas. We are a county

19:23.674 --> 19:28.341
commission, is one of the business managers of the 
county. I don't know. Okay, so as a commissioner,

19:32.452 --> 19:36.298
you meet what, once a week, once a month? Once a week 
or in our hours, 24 hours a day, seven days a week. We

19:42.428 --> 19:45.373
used to think county commissioners had to do with 
the roads. They still have to do with the roads, but

19:45.413 --> 19:48.257
of course that's a very minor thing. My only 
previous connection with county commissioners

19:49.099 --> 19:55.729
was in my home, Lee County, and the county 
commissioner is the chief of the road gang. Well,

19:55.709 --> 20:01.759
and he used to be the man that could run the road 
greater than the best was a good county

19:55.709 --> 20:01.759
commissioner. But now with all the roads being, or 
most all of them being paved, I guess the highway

20:01.779 --> 20:07.248
department takes care of them. Well, no, we have. 
You have a few that aren't. We have a lot, and some

20:09.472 --> 20:20.130
counties have more, and it's different, but it's 
really and truly a county commissioner that is, as

20:09.472 --> 20:20.130
I say, would almost be a, have the same functions as 
the director of a bank. So you meet and approve

20:24.250 --> 20:34.165
expenditures for the county and direct the 
policies of the county and so forth and so on. And I

20:35.547 --> 20:40.735
gather with, is this Amarillo County or? It's 
Potter County. Potter County. And with a city the

20:42.993 --> 20:51.262
size of Amarillo in it, why, you have a lot of 
financial obligations to take care of. My

20:52.083 --> 20:59.371
particular precinct does not have a county road in 
it, which is unique in itself. I doubt there's many

20:59.471 --> 21:01.053
others. How many commissioners are in Potter 
County? There's four. Every county in Texas has

21:06.019 --> 21:08.882
four commissioners. Is that, what, a four-year 
term now? Yeah, it's a four-year term now. And I

21:14.468 --> 21:24.419
have two more years after this one, and I would like 
to run until they run me out. Well, do you have any

21:24.439 --> 21:27.243
ambitions of going up above the level? No, I like 
this. I'm sorry that I didn't get into politics 25

21:29.085 --> 21:35.472
or 30 years ago, but this is fine. I like it, and I 
enjoy it, and I've enjoyed a little success, and

21:35.592 --> 21:39.797
I'm now president of the West Texas County Judge 
and Commissioner Association. I have been

21:43.624 --> 21:55.820
president of the Panhandle County Judge and 
Commissioner Association, which is probably a

21:43.624 --> 21:55.820
name only outside the fact that this is the year 
that we're trying to change the Constitution. We

21:55.860 --> 21:59.484
have been very active in Austin this year. That is 
at the County Judges and Commissioners. That's

22:01.787 --> 22:02.268
right. Organization. What

22:07.790 --> 22:20.428
What sort of relationship is there, and I don't 
mean by this is there fighting or what, but say

22:07.790 --> 22:20.428
between the city council of Amarillo and the 
county commissioners, do you work together on

22:07.790 --> 22:20.428
various and sundry things? We try to work together 
on many different projects. Outside of

22:26.136 --> 22:30.983
personalities, we work together real well. It's 
almost like apples and oranges in lots of ways.

22:35.089 --> 22:35.890
What I mean is The city handles only misdemeanors. 
We handle only felons for our jail. So when you talk

22:44.589 --> 22:53.042
about a city county jail,

22:44.589 --> 22:53.042
we're talking about felons and they're talking 
about misdemeanors. It's different.

22:57.870 --> 23:03.278
We have something to do with the schools and the 
county schools because the county school

22:57.870 --> 23:03.278
superintendent is a part of our duties. I don't 
mean he's under our jurisdiction exactly, but he

23:05.371 --> 23:08.775
is. So you still have a county superintendent 
school?

23:14.040 --> 23:15.341
It's a very interesting word. I think in a number of 
counties they discontinued that office of county

23:15.402 --> 23:19.045
superintendent. That's right. In fact, in my home 
county, Lee County, they discontinued it, I

23:19.926 --> 23:26.353
think, partially at the insistence of the 
incumbent. Well, that could be true, and I can see

23:26.513 --> 23:29.556
why. But Potter County is fortunate in that we have 
good schools, good county school. Amarillo is the

23:35.971 --> 23:38.934
only city in this county. There's no other 
incorporated town or anything. This is the only

23:41.496 --> 23:44.018
city in this town. That makes it sort of different 
from almost anything else, too. It's a different

23:49.764 --> 23:52.506
county. I think probably even Harris County has 
more than one city in it. Yes, it does. I think

23:58.151 --> 24:02.275
Houston has more than one city in all of them. I have 
got to know There's a lot of Aggies in politics. I

24:06.223 --> 24:08.286
have found that to be true. Yeah, I think so. We 
have, I know, a number in the legislature. Yes, and

24:11.992 --> 24:17.301
we have a lot of them in county government. And I've 
got to know some of those in the legislature. Judge

24:20.105 --> 24:24.192
Holbrook in Galveston is one I can call the name 
right now. Well, I know, I think... I don't know how

24:29.219 --> 24:38.608
much this relates, but I know the Aggies have just 
formed a bar association, I believe, of former

24:29.219 --> 24:38.608
students. I wouldn't doubt that. I wouldn't doubt 
that. I'm glad. I'm glad. I'm definitely glad.

24:42.052 --> 24:43.373
Some kind of a legal association. Of course, we're 
having a little bit. We had a little bit in the new

24:44.734 --> 24:48.178
constitution that all county judges should be 
lawyers. And, of course, I was very much involved

24:48.198 --> 24:54.484
in that discussion.

24:55.088 --> 24:58.717
Did you participate in the hearings before the 
committee that drafted the Constitution? Oh,

24:58.737 --> 24:58.898
yes. That's right. That's right. But that's a 
minor part. I mean, thousands of other people did

25:02.045 --> 25:04.391
the same thing. Okay. Let's see.
