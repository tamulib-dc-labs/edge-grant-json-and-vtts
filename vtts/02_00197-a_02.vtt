WEBVTT

00:03.406 --> 00:25.652
The measure of congeniality, another person 
might characterize it as weakness, that in my

00:03.406 --> 00:25.652
relationship to Scott and White, that I did not 
insist on the classical control by academia of the

00:03.406 --> 00:25.652
clinic. That was a crucial issue and it still is and 
it isn't necessary. It can be gotten around. Am I

00:34.693 --> 00:43.004
correct in feeling that both you and Dr. Brindley 
were trying to figure out how to make it work? Yes,

00:43.605 --> 00:44.186
sir. This is self-revisionism or self-whatever, 
but there is no question that that was the attitude

00:46.870 --> 00:56.964
100% of the time. That's what I always thought. 
Yes. And... here on the campus did you feel that was

01:02.350 --> 01:31.176
the attitude of Chancellor Williams and 
President Miller and Vice President Prescott

01:02.350 --> 01:31.176
absolutely absolutely I think they would have 
agreed to anything that I had proposed they were so

01:02.350 --> 01:31.176
anxious I don't anxious is not the right word 
enthusiastic I don't want to use anxious because

01:02.350 --> 01:31.176
it conveys a certain In the early months of your 
work with Scott and White, do you remember any

01:32.101 --> 01:42.434
specific examples of Dr. Brindley's help? It was 
more subtle than that. He was such a towering

01:47.440 --> 01:56.491
figure at Scott and White that merely the evidence 
that he wanted to make it work was sufficient. I

01:58.774 --> 02:00.015
think that that very likely

02:00.569 --> 02:27.927
someone other than Dr. Brindley, I don't know the 
past history of the institution very much, but

02:00.569 --> 02:27.927
subsequently I don't think anyone else could have 
carried it off with the authority,

02:00.569 --> 02:27.927
and by authority I mean the personality 
authority, the personal authority that Dr.

02:00.569 --> 02:27.927
Brindley had that made it work. And his influence 
with the trustees, I think he was the kingpin. Was

02:35.578 --> 02:38.761
Olin Teague still our congressman? No, but Oliver 
Meadows was another person, incidentally, whom

02:39.722 --> 02:51.015
you might, I don't know whether Oliver is still 
alive. He was ranching up in North Texas. Oliver

02:54.338 --> 02:57.762
Meadows was the administrative assistant to Olin 
Teague. And I think Oliver Meadows probably was

02:58.703 --> 03:10.717
the genius behind the establishment of five new 
medical schools under the auspices of the

02:58.703 --> 03:10.717
Veterans Administration. And we were one of those 
five. Indeed. That's Oliver Meadows. And he has

03:14.962 --> 03:19.227
never received recognition for that, 
incidentally. Teague, of course, would do

03:20.708 --> 03:28.137
whatever his administrative assistant told him 
to do, like any good congressman.

03:29.787 --> 03:36.739
Were there, as you were working with the VA 
hospital up there, who were the key people that you

03:29.787 --> 03:36.739
worked with?

03:39.524 --> 03:44.333
I remember one or two, but I don't remember their 
names. There was one physician who was important,

03:45.235 --> 03:54.411
Julian Acker, who is dead now, cancer of the lung, 
he smoked a pipe and that sort of thing. But there

03:55.083 --> 03:58.767
was a senior administrator. In the VA system, 
there's a lay administrator who's really in

03:58.807 --> 04:02.772
charge. The VA entered into the relationship with 
a good deal of suspicion, feeling among other

04:03.954 --> 04:14.186
things that we were a VA medical school and they 
should be running things. And they had a long time

04:14.827 --> 04:20.453
tense relationship with Scott and White. A 
certain number of the Scott and White physicians

04:20.473 --> 04:24.398
were consultants at the VA. There was an enormous 
gradient of, what shall I say, skepticism about

04:24.935 --> 04:38.390
the quality of medicine as between Scott and White 
and the VA hospital, with some justification

04:24.935 --> 04:38.390
probably at that time. So the VA hospital was 
uncomfortable with the relationship with Scott

04:40.111 --> 04:50.723
and White assuming the senior role, as it were. 
Soon after you got here, did you develop a kind of a

04:51.631 --> 04:58.522
game plan as to what you were, step by step, what you 
were going to try to do? I think so, probably. I

05:00.666 --> 05:01.587
never wrote it down. Can you describe kind of what 
it was? Well, I wanted very much, and this proved to

05:07.356 --> 05:14.668
not be doable. I wanted the medical school to be 
part of the university. That's a cliche, but I

05:18.687 --> 05:21.951
swear I wanted that. And it did not work. And it did 
not work over again some traditional, highly

05:28.440 --> 05:43.980
traditional academic values on the part of 
faculty members, both here on campus and in the

05:28.440 --> 05:43.980
medical school. I wanted very much to have,

05:46.053 --> 06:07.577
just to be more integrated I guess really with the 
rest of the university than the respective

05:46.053 --> 06:07.577
colleges are in the university, more than 
agriculture or engineering or science or

05:46.053 --> 06:07.577
whatever. I thought that could be done and that was 
part of a fairly popular current. at that time in

06:14.825 --> 06:16.667
medical education. Never really accomplished. 
One of the convincing, one of the reasons that the

06:19.229 --> 06:30.880
LCME moved favorably on this medical school was 
that it was to be on the university campus. It

06:31.581 --> 06:33.062
wasn't going to be in Dallas. It was to be on the 
campus. And that didn't work out. In trying to make

06:39.949 --> 06:42.992
it work, who were your best allies? I suppose Dr. 
Prescott and I don't remember the others. Were

06:50.277 --> 06:51.659
there any deans that were? No, no the deans the 
deans the ones that are most relevant wanted to

06:51.940 --> 07:12.810
take over let's say chemistry biochemistry 
wanted to take over biochemistry in a medical

06:51.940 --> 07:12.810
school or the like and always veterinary medicine 
was very

07:15.541 --> 07:19.567
How shall I say that in the least prejudicial way? 
Very skeptical. I don't remember whether you had a

07:22.692 --> 07:26.118
veterinary school at Missouri or not. You did. 
Well, perhaps by the time you were there, they were

07:26.919 --> 07:31.626
good buddies. They were that close together, too. 
But that was not a comfortable relationship. All

07:38.978 --> 07:39.178
right. So one of the things you had to work on 
quickly— was the second year yes and then the

07:42.878 --> 08:02.980
clinical yes describe describe how that came 
about

07:42.878 --> 08:02.980
well i don't i at that time in in medical education 
and maybe also in the university deans could be a

07:42.878 --> 08:02.980
lot more autocratic than they can now And so I don't 
remember that we, we didn't have any votes about

08:03.888 --> 08:07.613
it, I'll tell you that. We didn't have a discussion 
as to whether or not we should affiliate with Scott

08:08.113 --> 08:15.282
and White and send students up there. All right. 
Was there enough space here on the campus for the

08:16.564 --> 08:20.609
first and second years? Yes. Okay. Yes. And they 
primarily in the Teague and where else? I don't

08:28.458 --> 08:29.219
remember. I know subsequently we got the old 
Creamery. But I don't remember, oh I know, in the,

08:32.558 --> 08:47.221
what was the old chemistry building,

08:32.558 --> 08:47.221
what's the name of that, quite an old building, but 
it was chemistry. We had space in there, kind of

08:48.162 --> 08:59.680
reluctant, and I must say that when I went around 
looking for space I didn't find a lot of

08:48.162 --> 08:59.680
cooperation among deans, there was nobody. 
They'd be glad to take over, but they weren't

09:00.048 --> 09:03.691
willing to give up space to do it. And who were some 
of your first key hires, your key additions? Very

09:11.699 --> 09:14.742
few, because they had essentially all been hired. 
Everybody was up at Scott and White, and the key

09:15.222 --> 09:18.825
people were down here. So I can't claim to have made 
any key hires. Do you remember when you first went

09:25.091 --> 09:28.114
to the legislature to... do any lobbying?

09:33.934 --> 09:55.473
Well,

09:33.934 --> 09:55.473
while Dr. Miller was president and Mac Prescott, I 
had no problem in talking with the, I get confused,

09:33.934 --> 09:55.473
I've been in enough states, I think it was the BEF, 
is there a BEF in Texas, Board of Educational

09:33.934 --> 09:55.473
Finance? Coordinating Board. Coordinating 
Board, but But the staff, what was the staff

09:58.452 --> 10:00.955
called? Okay, anyhow, I could go to them and talk to 
them privately and tell them what we needed. But

10:08.282 --> 10:13.347
with Jarvis's resignation, there were barriers 
set up immediately. I could no longer freelance as

10:15.610 --> 10:20.775
I had in Oregon and particularly in New Mexico. New 
Mexico, I got a cancer center established there. A

10:28.051 --> 10:41.506
million dollars was an enormous amount of money in 
New Mexico, and at that time, and I went before the

10:28.051 --> 10:41.506
legislature, president didn't impede me or 
anything, go to it, anything you can get, get. And I

10:42.187 --> 10:46.732
said, we need a million dollars, we'll get 
matching funds, we'll get three to one matching

10:42.187 --> 10:46.732
funds. And one of the legislators asked me, said, 
look, I'm all enthused about this, it's a lot of

10:47.473 --> 10:56.944
money, but I want to know what you're going to do 
with that building when we have a cure for cancer.

11:00.367 --> 11:02.670
And that was a serious inquiry. He was doing his 
job. Don't we wish that question had become

11:04.653 --> 11:11.221
appropriate?

11:11.402 --> 11:11.542
Yes. But the point of the anecdote is that in 
Oregon, to a lesser extent, but in a place like New

11:11.642 --> 11:28.264
Mexico where I'd had most of my experience, I had 
free entree to the legislature, to the staff, and

11:11.642 --> 11:28.264
at first down here I did. with the staff who were the 
people who were most influential I don't mean to

11:28.582 --> 11:57.373
uh... but oh and you know I got a lot of help from 
uh... from uh... Billy Clayton he was a big help

11:28.582 --> 11:57.373
uh... yes or or he had I'm not sure of the timing 
precisely but uh... he was a big help and then

11:28.582 --> 11:57.373
subsequently from the uh... uh... the the vice 
governor the deputy governor Who? Lieutenant

11:58.174 --> 11:58.974
Governor. Lieutenant Governor. The giant, 
Bullock. Oh, Bob Bullock. Oh, well, Hobby, too. We

12:04.259 --> 12:06.141
got good help from Hobby. Hobby and Bullock and 
Bill Clayton were very supportive. And you know

12:12.847 --> 12:21.755
another guy who was supportive, although 
skeptical, I mean, playing his role of

12:12.847 --> 12:21.755
skepticism, was Ken Ashworth. Are you going to 
talk with Ken or talk with him? No, I want to very

12:24.157 --> 12:25.198
much. Yes. were there any key now your program of 
people that you're talking to is this based on some

12:26.547 --> 12:53.213
mortality table well I am trying to talk to senior 
people

12:26.547 --> 12:53.213
you've talked to Mack have you yes

12:26.547 --> 12:53.213
in that first year as you're getting ready for the 
students for year three and four to move up to

12:54.070 --> 12:57.075
Temple. You worked with Dr. Brindley. What 
arrangements were made up there for them in the

13:00.380 --> 13:04.227
first years?

13:07.873 --> 13:20.854
We were able to persuade the Veterans 
Administration to clean out, that was a

13:07.873 --> 13:20.854
cantonment hospital, to empty a couple of 
buildings and turn them into student quarters.

13:22.403 --> 13:27.489
And we did not require that the students live 
there, but they were very grateful for the

13:22.403 --> 13:27.489
opportunity. The VA did a splendid job of fixing up 
those living quarters for the students. Was that

13:33.355 --> 13:41.465
arrangement to have both the VA and Scott and 
White, was that comparatively special for the

13:33.355 --> 13:41.465
Indian Medical School?

13:46.370 --> 13:48.833
In a sense it was, but in a sense it was not.

13:51.496 --> 14:18.398
the somewhere right after world war ii the end of 
world war ii the veterans administration was

13:51.496 --> 14:18.398
beleaguered by people who were skeptical about 
the quality of care and so they established dean's

13:51.496 --> 14:18.398
committees at the at all of the virtually all of the 
va hospitals and dean chaired that committee and

13:51.496 --> 14:18.398
it was really an oversight committee It was a 
board, a medical board for the VA hospital. So they

14:24.470 --> 14:25.912
were familiar with that.

14:29.959 --> 14:41.398
And they were familiar from other VA hospitals 
with the

14:29.959 --> 14:41.398
way universities and medical schools appointed 
their department heads chairman as the heads of

14:42.104 --> 15:09.698
the services in the VA hospitals it was resented 
but it was familiar

14:42.104 --> 15:09.698
but here we were coming into an established

14:42.104 --> 15:09.698
rather tense relationship and suddenly saying to 
them okay from now on the chairman of surgery at

14:42.104 --> 15:09.698
Scott and White is going to be the chief at surgery 
at the VA hospital and is going to be on the dean's

15:10.201 --> 15:11.923
committee. So that was resented. And that was new. 
And in

15:17.391 --> 15:28.526
general, they took that fairly well because we had 
the leverage in Washington.

15:32.171 --> 15:34.133
They got direction from Washington. Are there 
some people at the VA who, in hindsight now,

15:34.434 --> 15:39.060
deserve compliments for making it work? some 
people in Temple

15:39.918 --> 16:08.288
I think only Julian Acker the and the typical 
student A&M medical student spent about how much

15:39.918 --> 16:08.288
time at Scott and White compared to VA I can't be 
precise I would say it might have been two-thirds

15:39.918 --> 16:08.288
at the time at Scott and White it's a little 
distorted because of course the VA hospital had no

15:39.918 --> 16:08.288
pediatrics and no OB-GYN So naturally they had 
those at Scott & White. The psychiatry service was

16:13.518 --> 16:29.558
much more current at Scott & White than at the VA 
where the issue was old men dying of emphysema and

16:13.518 --> 16:29.558
cancer of the lung, alcoholics. Can you share with 
this machine any examples of specific events or

16:30.479 --> 16:37.448
incidents about The beginning up there, serious 
or humorous?

16:45.009 --> 16:47.833
Well, nothing comes to mind, Haskell. Nothing 
where something in the middle of the road stopped

16:48.213 --> 16:53.260
or went dead or somebody called? No. So that first 
class up there, approximately 24? Yes. In number.

17:02.912 --> 17:07.057
And do you remember how many of those graduated? 
All of them. Was that unusual? No. That's not

17:14.304 --> 17:18.147
unusual nationally?

17:18.167 --> 17:24.193
I would say not again given the context of a new 
medical school with a very small class. No, I don't

17:24.653 --> 17:25.474
think so. And then when did the numbers increase 
per class? Only after I left. I guess we went to 36

17:38.060 --> 17:42.505
reluctantly. I was strongly opposed and am still 
opposed to increasing the class size. I had

17:48.673 --> 17:54.480
another one of my illusions was that we could have 
an elitist medical school. My paradigm was

17:55.521 --> 18:07.476
Dartmouth, which historically had been the first 
two years for Harvard, to a lesser extent for Yale.

18:08.401 --> 18:13.488
And always had had 24 students, of course. Under 
that dream, would ours have gone somewhere for

18:14.670 --> 18:20.779
their third and fourth year? No, to Scott and 
White. That would have been all right. That would

18:24.103 --> 18:25.105
have been acceptable. But to keep a very small 
student body and to have very close attention to

18:25.485 --> 18:34.979
everything

18:25.485 --> 18:34.979
about them. As you were planning it, what was going 
to be special about this medical school? I would

18:42.277 --> 19:07.332
guess in the first instance and the biggest 
disappointment was it would be part of the

18:42.277 --> 19:07.332
university and I guess secondly was the pressure 
within the there was pressure within the basic

18:42.277 --> 19:07.332
science faculty here to get bigger they couldn't 
understand why I didn't want to get larger why I

18:42.277 --> 19:07.332
didn't want more students Why did they want it 
bigger? Because everything is better if it's

19:10.334 --> 19:13.777
bigger. The other disappointment that I had but I 
had anticipated this and knew it would really be a

19:14.718 --> 19:37.639
struggle was in the development of a true research 
program at Scott and White and to have them put a

19:14.718 --> 19:37.639
value and I mean now a financial value really on 
research

19:14.718 --> 19:37.639
in other words to be willing to give an individual 
twenty five percent of his time free that he didn't

19:39.290 --> 20:09.010
have to produce income clinical income to do 
research were you planning on these students

19:39.290 --> 20:09.010
these twenty four or so students were they also 
going to be elite and quality well yeah I hope so how

19:39.290 --> 20:09.010
were we going to recruit those in large measure 
because of having twenty four students or thirty

19:39.290 --> 20:09.010
six students and we did that at the beginning we did 
We quickly became competitive, and there are some

20:09.378 --> 20:16.144
fine medical schools here, I mean in Texas. Am I not 
correct that they did quite well on their

20:16.785 --> 20:19.447
national? Absolutely, outstanding, 
outstanding. And we got the standard response

20:21.909 --> 20:32.019
from the other faculties of the other medical 
schools where you're teaching them to the

20:21.909 --> 20:32.019
examination. Well, we can't do that. We were 
teaching them. And they had confidence, and they

20:38.707 --> 20:41.770
knew what they knew. And another thing that I felt, 
and here I got a little bit of a problem with the

20:41.790 --> 21:05.356
students to some extent, and this was a negative 
factor in recruiting students, students who went

20:41.790 --> 21:05.356
to Bentaube, I mean, Baylor, Bentaube or to, 
what's the big hospital in Dallas? Baylor. No.

21:07.900 --> 21:10.904
Parkland.

21:10.924 --> 21:17.732
Students there knew that in their junior year they 
were going to do brain surgery. And students knew

21:17.752 --> 21:31.229
that they came to Texas A&M and Scott and White, 
what they were going to do in their third year was

21:17.752 --> 21:31.229
some blood counts and examine a patient under the 
supervision of an experienced doctor and tell

21:17.752 --> 21:31.229
them what was going on. The student was going to be a 
student, not a young doctor. And that was a

21:37.010 --> 21:39.814
negative. But that was another thing in my 
old-fashioned

21:39.834 --> 21:49.188
mind was that students were students and should be 
students. Here in Bryan College Station, what was

21:50.430 --> 21:59.623
the attitude of Scott and White and the other 
medical... Well, Scott and White... I would say

21:59.924 --> 22:04.350
that St. Joseph Maybe in the person of Sister, 
what's her name? Kiwi, what's her name? Sister

22:10.851 --> 22:11.792
something or other. Krenz, Kunz, Kunz, Kunz or 
something. They didn't quite understand why we

22:15.996 --> 22:33.915
didn't immediately open up to them, why we didn't 
just appoint their doctors as professors and send

22:15.996 --> 22:33.915
the medical students over, feeling that they 
could just as well be educated at, they didn't

22:15.996 --> 22:33.915
understand, simply did not understand that. and 
that's common when you put a medical school in a new

22:34.756 --> 22:56.065
environment all the doctors in town think that 
they're professors and they'll teach the

22:34.756 --> 22:56.065
students the real stuff were there some Brazos 
County doctors that were particularly positive

22:34.756 --> 22:56.065
in being members of the A&M medical team only 
subsequently O.C. was one one who was kind of a

22:56.085 --> 23:02.974
missed blessing was Harry Lipscomb He'd been on 
the faculty at Baylor when Baylor was very much a

23:03.882 --> 23:12.311
clinical school and still had those values. He was 
of the same vintage then of Phil Davis when the

23:12.331 --> 23:19.458
local doctors were the medical school. There were 
one or two like that. Others were just kind of

23:23.142 --> 23:25.985
indifferent. We didn't have much in the way of the 
overt hostility that we found in at UCLA

23:33.481 --> 23:39.491
particularly but also in Albuquerque where there 
was real hostility. The principal reservation

23:40.213 --> 23:58.324
that the medical community of Texas not alone of 
College Station had about a relationship with

23:40.213 --> 23:58.324
Scott and White was that Scott and White was a pinko 
organization because it was a group practice and

23:40.213 --> 23:58.324
group practice was borderline communistic.

24:01.544 --> 24:30.133
the

24:01.544 --> 24:30.133
was Scott and White almost unanimously 
supportive no no no no no but again they didn't get

24:01.544 --> 24:30.133
to vote on it they were really given the they were 
given the option the physicians of either being

24:01.544 --> 24:30.133
part of the teaching program or not and virtually 
everybody opted to be part of the teaching program

24:01.544 --> 24:30.133
and they quickly became proprietary

24:30.620 --> 24:58.602
looking back on those years what did medical 
education under your direction here what did A&M

24:30.620 --> 24:58.602
do best and then what did it do least best in 
medicine

24:30.620 --> 24:58.602
the transition from Jarvis and Mac to the 
succeeding hierarchies was not good and I

24:59.982 --> 25:28.082
attributed it to the fact that the senior 
administrators had had no experience with

24:59.982 --> 25:28.082
medical education before had no concept of the way 
in which I believe but I'll bet every dean in

24:59.982 --> 25:28.082
engineering or agriculture or whatever believes 
that we have a special culture I'm sure there's a

24:59.982 --> 25:28.082
special culture in engineering they were more 
used to that it seems to me that there was a there was

25:28.737 --> 25:56.382
a could have been my paranoia but I really am pretty 
level headed about that resentment that doctors

25:28.737 --> 25:56.382
were rich and that we should have that really what 
we ought to have is a national health care system

25:28.737 --> 25:56.382
and that somehow we were a plutocratic 
organization and arrogant and condescending.

26:00.093 --> 26:06.461
Some of that was probably true, but that was 
difficult. I think that it would have been better

26:06.862 --> 26:26.166
if the several presidents and vice presidents had 
had four or five years at the University of

26:06.862 --> 26:26.166
Missouri first

26:06.862 --> 26:26.166
or wherever and knew what accommodations could be 
made to medicine and what the opportunities were.

26:30.847 --> 26:44.880
What we missed, we just so badly missed it, was an 
appreciation of

26:30.847 --> 26:44.880
the value that a medical school could bring to a 
university campus. I think that was never

26:46.362 --> 26:48.944
understood. Can you think of any examples of where 
an opportunity was missed because of that lack of

26:56.437 --> 27:03.948
understanding?

27:03.968 --> 27:05.871
I guess they were aborted so early. They were in a 
pre-embryo state. Were you part of the planning of

27:11.559 --> 27:15.785
the new medical building across the tracks? Oh 
yes, yes. Describe how that came about.

27:24.017 --> 27:25.920
There had developed during that time a paradigm 
for basic medical sciences buildings they were to

27:26.677 --> 27:55.384
be multifunctional laboratories were to be 
multifunctional and we pretty much fit into that

27:26.677 --> 27:55.384
mold I did not have the leverage that I believed 
that I should have with the architects the

27:26.677 --> 27:55.384
architects were similarly inexperienced in 
medical education and really did not listen well

27:55.820 --> 28:09.372
And the buildings and grounds people, whatever 
the hell, colonel, general, whatever, some guy

27:55.820 --> 28:09.372
who ran that thing, of course knew what buildings 
should be. No concept at all about a medical

28:09.392 --> 28:12.415
school. And so we were constrained, I think, in the 
design more than we should have been.

28:24.486 --> 28:25.607
General Peeler. Yes, yes, yes. Now you see for some 
reason that didn't happen at UCLA and it didn't

28:29.458 --> 28:38.211
happen at New Mexico. Somehow people there were 
more freewheeling or maybe I well and certainly in

28:39.373 --> 28:54.835
New Mexico I had an opportunity to be part of and to 
observe it and participate less so because I was so

28:39.373 --> 28:54.835
junior at UCLA. But those, well, UCLA, the 
president at UCLA at that time was Murphy, who was a

28:55.625 --> 29:10.106
physician, subsequently became chairman of the 
board of the Los Angeles Times. And at New Mexico,

29:11.068 --> 29:24.147
we had Mr. Popejoy, who had no doctorate, was Mr. 
Popejoy, and he was a Williams, a kindly old

29:11.068 --> 29:24.147
gentleman, benevolent, wonderful, supportive, 
a whole different kind of old-fashioned way of

29:24.818 --> 29:34.791
doing things. If you could have planned the 
building entirely as you wanted it, what would

29:34.811 --> 29:41.761
that medical facility have included that it does 
not? What would you have done differently? I think

29:47.188 --> 29:52.615
I know I would have wanted more commons area for the 
students. I would have wanted it to be more

29:53.168 --> 30:08.204
congenial from the standpoint of students 
lounging around and talking to each other and

29:53.168 --> 30:08.204
interacting with each other and to some extent 
with the faculty. Even something in the way of a

30:10.005 --> 30:17.213
snack bar, of something to soften it in that way. 
What about in terms of its facilities?

30:21.485 --> 30:51.205
construction and laboratory not that bad we 
probably would have arranged them differently

30:21.485 --> 30:51.205
but kind of cut and dried I mean out of somebody's 
book as the building was constructed it was

30:21.485 --> 30:51.205
designed for classes of what size I think 48 I 
believe and we're now at 64 yeah so theoretically

30:21.485 --> 30:51.205
we're yes there was another thing happening not 
alone in our medical school in medical education

30:51.590 --> 31:13.851
with the animal rights people and sentimentality 
and that kind of thing the nature of laboratories

30:51.590 --> 31:13.851
changed physiology particularly so that the 
needs and demands on laboratories were much less

30:51.590 --> 31:13.851
and even the conviction in medical education that 
students ought to experience. There was a better,

31:18.865 --> 31:31.979
there was more utilization of, it wasn't, it was 
the advent of computers or of simulated

31:18.865 --> 31:31.979
experiments and the like rather than the actual 
hands-on doing of experiments. So that those

31:33.081 --> 31:40.369
changes in medical education have made it doable 
to have 64 students in there. It's become somewhat

31:41.049 --> 31:43.332
more didactic.
