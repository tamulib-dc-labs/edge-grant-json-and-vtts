WEBVTT

00:02.731 --> 00:05.574
No, sir. No, sir. I must have been before my time or 
after.

00:11.439 --> 00:11.960
Let's see. Did you all go to any campus dances? No, 
sir. As a matter of fact, Richard and I never did go

00:18.666 --> 00:22.109
to dance. See, I don't dance. I'm a teetotaler. I 
don't drink and I don't smoke. I don't go to dances

00:28.976 --> 00:32.299
because my grandmother raised me, you see. She was 
really strict and she didn't want me to get mixed up

00:32.684 --> 00:42.956
with the wrong people and start drinking with them 
and all this. I share those practices with you. And

00:47.401 --> 00:57.072
then my wife was brought up with the Baptists in 
Beeville, and you know, the Baptists don't dance

00:47.401 --> 00:57.072
either. Now, there had been some veterans' 
temporary housing down here on this side of the

00:57.862 --> 01:06.810
football stadium. That had been removed by the 
time you all got here. There were some temporary,

01:10.383 --> 01:22.557
where G. Raleigh White Coliseum is now, there were 
some temporary veteran's houses in 46 and 47, but

01:10.383 --> 01:22.557
those were gone by the time y'all got here.

01:26.081 --> 01:35.732
As you are going on toward that major in animal 
husbandry, who did you turn to for advice and

01:26.081 --> 01:35.732
counsel? Who gave, who told you what courses to 
take? Nobody told me what courses to take, no.

01:44.948 --> 01:57.284
Rachel had a brother that was working for the BVL 
Experimental Station, and he was an animal

01:44.948 --> 01:57.284
husband and an agronomer, okay? And in 
conversations with him and the other two that were

01:57.304 --> 02:05.415
attending here,

02:06.796 --> 02:15.658
I was interested in agronomy, but then I was afraid 
that I would not be able to pass maybe the chemistry

02:17.157 --> 02:22.703
or the math that went along with it. So I had to 
select something that I knew I could pass. And so I

02:28.970 --> 02:35.557
started considering getting a liberal arts or a 
business. And business looked better. And so then

02:39.641 --> 02:47.029
because of my experiences and the work I used to do, 
I thought I wanted to major in marketing with a

02:47.482 --> 02:52.329
minor in English. Who advised you to do that? Well, 
to tell you the truth, nobody. Oh, okay. I took the

03:01.561 --> 03:04.025
catalog and I was going through it. If I want to 
major here, what question do I have to take? Can I

03:11.235 --> 03:12.136
pass them? I was looking back. hey, I was 32 years 
old, I was out of high school, and I was a high school

03:16.085 --> 03:20.470
dropout. So I had, there was some disadvantages 
there, but I wanted to be sure after, you know,

03:21.130 --> 03:34.064
getting rid of my house and furniture and so forth, 
and for me to flunk out again, no. I gotta make a go of

03:34.084 --> 03:39.169
it, and I made that decision myself, see. All 
right, now, as you began your senior year, When did

03:43.979 --> 03:46.783
you buy that ring? Oh, I didn't buy the ring. One of 
the brothers, Rachel's brothers that had already

03:51.490 --> 04:01.043
graduated, he was a petroleum engineer with 
Atlantic Refining. He was nice enough to buy my

04:03.547 --> 04:10.797
ring and get Rachel her ring. I want to tell you 
something, you won't believe it. I still have the

04:14.253 --> 04:15.254
ring. This is the original one. And I learned to 
take it off when I wash my hands or when I'm working,

04:17.577 --> 04:23.485
so it won't bleed. And then I take some India ink and 
I cover it, then I let it dry, and I take a damp rag and

04:24.566 --> 04:33.078
clean it off. So it still looks almost new. Yeah. 
And some people look at that, is that a new one? No. I

04:43.362 --> 04:44.523
didn't ask.

04:47.807 --> 04:58.878
My brother-in-law, his name was Alvino, Alvino 
Reyes, he told Rachel he paid $29.50 for this ring.

04:58.898 --> 04:59.479
Oh my, my. Believe it or not. Now, his son, he had a 
son that was handicapped, and I decided to return

05:01.922 --> 05:11.732
the favor. And I told him, I said, look Bubba, I want 
to pay for your record. Oh he was pleased. So I

05:22.038 --> 05:23.580
shelled out $175. I did that gladly really. But I 
don't know what that costs now. Do you have any ring

05:32.114 --> 05:33.756
stories? Have you ever lost your ring and found it 
in somebody? Or have you ever been somewhere on the

05:37.920 --> 05:42.485
other side of the world and somebody saw that Aggie 
ring? No, sir, I never lost it. I made sure that I put

05:46.209 --> 05:50.914
it in my pocket.

05:53.376 --> 05:57.801
Well, even to this day, people see my ring, they 
say, Hey, I just saw your ring. And before they

06:00.549 --> 06:02.992
could say anything, I went to whip out and meet 
them. And here we are. And right now, I'm retired,

06:05.255 --> 06:18.632
and I'm a volunteer at a cafeteria-style 
restaurant that belongs to the First Baptist

06:05.255 --> 06:18.632
Church back in San Antonio. And Southwestern Bell 
has a monster building just about two blocks away.

06:24.500 --> 06:28.024
I was on the Southwestern Bell board for 17 years. 
So there's a bunch of Aggies that are working there

06:29.236 --> 06:35.062
and they come over there and eat. And I'll bust 
tables you know and do arching in. And when I fill up

06:40.427 --> 06:45.853
their glasses with tea, it starts again. So I greet 
them. Hi Aggie. And people turn around. Yes sir,

06:52.799 --> 06:58.365
that ring touches something. I wear this one, 
that's my Masonic ring. And some guy said, look,

07:02.923 --> 07:06.989
I'm wearing the same kind of ring you've got. But 
that's, I don't recall going somewhere in, you

07:08.651 --> 07:27.576
know, a way, or just nothing of any importance. 
that I know of that I have for you. All right, let's

07:33.707 --> 07:34.367
see. Your senior year, you mention in here that 
your son starts school and your wife got sick. Oh,

07:43.776 --> 07:44.036
yeah. And so you had to double up and you moved to a 
dormitory. What was it like for an old man to live

07:50.122 --> 07:56.668
with those undergraduates?

07:57.762 --> 08:05.796
I went in with a

07:57.762 --> 08:05.796
Nunn-Regg student. He was real nice. And we had to 
share the room. And I had the top bunk and he had the

08:10.123 --> 08:12.868
lower bunk. and uh he was uh how old was he he must 
have been uh oh about 24. no he was a veteran also i

08:13.996 --> 08:40.813
don't know i don't recall that he was but he was not 
in the corps and he was getting his degree in

08:13.996 --> 08:40.813
accounting did you eat in the in the sabisa then uh 
no oh I, you see, the MSC had a place to eat, and I

08:40.996 --> 08:53.293
remember I used to eat basket burgers. Give me a 
basket with a hamburger and some french fries.

08:56.897 --> 08:57.839
Right, right.

09:00.903 --> 09:09.214
Let's see, then you didn't buy senior boots since 
you weren't in the Corps, and you didn't go to final

09:00.903 --> 09:09.214
review. But you did go to commencement. Oh, yes. 
Where was commencement held? At Kyle Field. At

09:15.849 --> 09:16.570
Kyle Field. Yes, sir. Do you remember who the 
speaker was? No, sir. Most of us don't remember who

09:20.055 --> 09:21.958
the speaker was. Who came? What family came for 
your commencement? My mother and two of my

09:27.887 --> 09:31.792
sisters. That was all. And then, of course, Rachel 
was there. And I remember her. When I went across

09:40.126 --> 09:49.619
the platform to get there, my sister said, that's 
my daddy.

09:49.639 --> 10:00.695
But look, before that, there used to be a fellow, 
his name was Don Harrison, and he used to work at a

09:49.639 --> 10:00.695
parts department with me. He was old. And he had two 
brothers that owned a clothing store. in San

10:08.729 --> 10:13.774
Antonio called Fomby's, and it stood for men. And 
he went to work for them, and he was a front man. He

10:21.622 --> 10:29.189
joined the Chamber of Commerce and he joined all 
these, you know, and tried to get people to come and

10:21.622 --> 10:29.189
patronize his store. So I went to my trust and said, 
I'm graduating, I don't have clothes, and I need a

10:30.370 --> 10:37.317
suit of clothes. I can't pay you. But as soon as I get 
a job, I'll pay you." He said, ah, bonk. He took over

10:44.597 --> 10:45.598
there. I got a brand new dark blue suit. And he wrote 
something on there. It's this. And he gave it to me.

10:58.816 --> 11:00.719
Otherwise, I didn't have a suit of clothes. And so 
that's part of our graduation. and uh it was it was

11:05.935 --> 11:27.876
great all right as you walked across that stage 
that day what feelings did you have in your heart oh

11:05.935 --> 11:27.876
i said i was relieved of all the pressure i was 
living under and this kind of thing that uh you know

11:05.935 --> 11:27.876
uh You don't have to repeat this, but my wife had 
hemorrhoids. And one of the hemorrhoids had some

11:36.334 --> 11:49.929
kind of a knot in it or something that her doctor, 
Dr. Lancaster, said that this could be something

11:36.334 --> 11:49.929
bad, and I think we better get it out of the way. And 
so I had some health insurance with me. I can't

11:56.982 --> 11:59.124
remember the name, but they called him Tack. He had 
an office in Northgate, you know, T-A-C-K. And it

11:59.745 --> 12:10.537
was that coverage I had that got my wife at the 
hospital there in Bealeville. And she, I was, I was

12:11.778 --> 12:26.955
sending her the, I was getting, I was sending her 
$60 of my $120. And now, see, I was the guy and I was,

12:27.678 --> 12:38.309
my gross was $80 a month. And of course, for the end 
of the month came by, I didn't get paid at the end of

12:39.570 --> 12:44.875
the month. You had to wait about two weeks. So, and I 
was sending the whole check to them in New York. I

12:53.104 --> 12:57.448
says, listen, you living over there with your 
mother, recuperating? And I don't want to hear any

12:57.850 --> 13:02.497
of your sisters or brothers saying that you were a 
charity case. You pay your mama and you tell her

13:03.338 --> 13:12.631
that, look, this is all I've got, but I want to pay 
for my food and for Robert's food and whatever. So

13:13.493 --> 13:23.487
they wouldn't come later on and criticize me for 
leaving my wife over there and let her mother take

13:13.493 --> 13:23.487
care of her. As you were getting ready to graduate, 
what kind of preparation did you think A&M had

13:25.492 --> 13:36.828
given you for the real world? Well. How well 
prepared were you? I was prepared. And

13:46.382 --> 13:54.874
when I went for the job interviews, I would get uh, 
offers for out of state, out of town. And my wife had

14:01.161 --> 14:06.328
tap roots in San Antonio, New York, and she didn't 
want to move anywhere. I said, oh, good, you know.

14:10.152 --> 14:14.397
And, uh, so I said, well, I'd have to find something 
here in San Antonio. And, uh, she says, all right,

14:14.978 --> 14:18.402
um, oh. I said, let's see, uh, what the Lord wants to 
do with us and, uh, see if we'll go from here. So

14:25.381 --> 14:40.234
I looked around and I got this, the best job I had was 
working on it at Lackland, civilian position. And

14:41.556 --> 14:54.027
Lackland had a requirement that you had to know 
this and this and this and this, or one year of

14:41.556 --> 14:54.027
college. That's a snap. And this was a big 
operation. The training needs a vision. Because

15:00.731 --> 15:04.978
Lackland, at the time I was there, was like a little 
college. Oh, it was huge. And the trainees weren't

15:07.523 --> 15:11.008
in there for training. They had three training 
bases, one in Rome, New York, one in California,

15:11.529 --> 15:18.340
and then the one there in San Antonio. So they 
closed these other two and left Lackland. And they

15:22.857 --> 15:24.820
had a dental school. They had a police school. They 
had . So the division would make custom-made

15:28.385 --> 15:50.518
teaching aids,

15:28.385 --> 15:50.518
all kinds of manuals, instruction manuals, 
building ceremonies, and whatever the

15:28.385 --> 15:50.518
instructors wanted besides the language school. 
They had a language school where they would teach

15:51.545 --> 15:59.334
English to these foreign pilots. So someday, we 
would need them as our allies. And the trainees

16:02.438 --> 16:08.184
also made language trainers. You're familiar 
with a language trainer, where you're watching it

16:08.204 --> 16:11.508
and hearing it. And it was nice, and security. My 
wife was satisfied. Then I got the opportunity to

16:21.852 --> 16:34.491
go to Kelly Air Force Base and it was a little bit 
more responsibility and it was a better job.

16:37.596 --> 16:42.443
Since I had all this experience with parts for 
General Motors, We didn't have a buyer that could

16:43.199 --> 16:47.786
buy aircraft parts. So I got in there and they 
shipped me off to Fort Lee, Virginia. Six weeks in a

16:55.898 --> 17:04.531
preparatory school for buyers. And I came back. 
And let me see.

17:13.608 --> 17:24.601
I had gone to the office, and all of a sudden there 
was a dead silence. What happened? The news came on

17:26.143 --> 17:28.486
that President Kennedy had been shot. Oh, my God, 
this would have to happen. Well, anyway, I stayed

17:32.871 --> 17:41.421
all night at Kelly and worked up from a bar to a 
contracting officer. with a warrant and it

17:42.160 --> 18:00.941
was the General's approval and one from up in 
command level and I had no limitations and it was

17:42.160 --> 18:00.941
good until I retired. As you look back, what did A&M 
for you, what did A&M do well?

18:10.966 --> 18:20.079
So get a job, and when you got it, you worked on it to 
completion, and that it would be done right. And

18:21.201 --> 18:22.904
they wouldn't settle for anything else. And that 
stayed with me. And so in my work, I went from A to Z,

18:26.168 --> 18:35.522
so that if my supervisors ever Well, they couldn't 
question me because it was all right there, ready

18:36.346 --> 18:41.532
to go. And complete it to a successful end and don't 
mess around and do it right. If you had all of the

18:50.383 --> 19:00.134
people that were at A&M when you were here, if all of 
them were here today, which ones would you most

18:50.383 --> 19:00.134
want to thank? To what people from that time are you 
most grateful? Tom Putty. You see, maybe I

19:06.721 --> 19:21.027
shouldn't say this, and you don't have to, but when 
I applied to the employment office, there was an

19:06.721 --> 19:21.027
old gentleman, you know, he had a big hat like he was 
a retired rancher. And he says, I can't consider

19:22.390 --> 19:26.738
you for a job. He says, you're a veteran, and you're 
getting $120 a month. He says, I've got some kids

19:33.226 --> 19:37.911
coming out of high school that don't have a penny. 
He says, I've got to give them priority. So I can't

19:41.775 --> 19:46.159
offer you a job. Oh, boy, that's when I started. And 
I went to Chevrolet dealer Brian Carpenter. I got

19:54.688 --> 19:57.231
all the help I need. Well, how about part-time? 
Somebody take inventory or something. And I went

20:04.604 --> 20:06.246
to Caldwell, same way.

20:09.468 --> 20:10.650
I was just about to give up. So I went back to meet Mr. 
Putty. And he turned things around for me. And I

20:16.335 --> 20:18.837
said, hey, let's. Are there any teachers or 
advisors that you'd also want to thank? Any

20:24.002 --> 20:24.742
faculty? Any staff? Yes. One was my English 
professor, Mr., and then there was, I can't think

20:28.075 --> 20:38.686
of his name, but you remember Mr. Esten? C.K. 
Esten. Yeah, he used to, him, I had him for English.

20:45.473 --> 20:53.762
And

20:45.473 --> 20:53.762
he made me give an oral report, see? and he liked it. 
He came over and he put his arm around me and we were

20:55.329 --> 20:59.814
good friends from then on. And let's see, I'm 
trying to think.

21:07.281 --> 21:09.103
Those were the only two, sir. What is it that builds 
Aggie spirit? What causes those feelings? Well,

21:18.453 --> 21:21.336
in my experience, If I had something to do with 
another guy, he was an Aggie. And I let him know I was

21:29.019 --> 21:30.861
an Aggie, too. That friendship was good together, 
see? And I knew that any dealings I had or any

21:36.907 --> 21:47.638
assistance I needed from a fellow Aggie, that I 
would get it. That if my car broke down on the

21:48.459 --> 21:51.222
highway, which it did, A bunch of Aggies in the 
corner had stopped. What can I do to help you? Do you

21:56.565 --> 21:59.489
need a flat fixed or whatever? And I knew that there 
was a binding thing there between Aggies, and I

21:59.509 --> 22:18.019
knew that if I had to deal with another Aggie for 
whatever, I was in need, that I could expect some

21:59.509 --> 22:18.019
form of help. What causes the Aggies, though, to be 
helpful to each other?

22:27.925 --> 22:34.095
What is it that happens while they're in school 
here?

22:35.076 --> 22:35.937
It's hard to say. I mean, words fail me. If

22:39.202 --> 22:48.597
there's a place that's owned by an Aggie, If I let 
them know, hey, I'm an Aggie, he will drop the

22:49.471 --> 23:07.134
restriction and it's a way of getting in or getting 
to know the person. We're given help to achieve

23:08.196 --> 23:18.229
what I'm trying to get or go for, and I can expect 
friendship and help that I wouldn't get from

23:18.833 --> 23:23.721
somebody else that was not an Aggie. Let me give you 
a for instance. My brother Bert, I mean my

23:28.508 --> 23:40.887
brother-in-law Bert, he was a cattle auctioneer, 
and he had to go to Montana

23:28.508 --> 23:40.887
for a cattle sale. And it was dark, you know, He was a 
stranger up there. He didn't know nobody. When he

23:51.595 --> 23:56.981
goes to the stockyards, there was a bunch of Aggies 
over there, agricultural people. And when Bert

23:57.622 --> 24:07.152
went over there to meet him, and he found out that 
there were Aggies, you know, he changed the whole

23:57.622 --> 24:07.152
thing. Anything he needed, he got it, because 
those Aggies would help him. And Bertone says,

24:13.019 --> 24:19.327
that goes on everywhere, in civilian life and in 
the military. And my son, he goes back and forth,

24:20.188 --> 24:26.375
and he meets Aggies all over. And they all, a lot of 
them come here for legal advice.

24:34.685 --> 24:40.933
If you could advise the leaders of Texas A&M today, 
what advice would you give them?

24:46.347 --> 25:06.414
to continue

24:46.347 --> 25:06.414
and enlarge on the friendship and the camaraderie 
of all Aggies. I say that because Plurton

25:07.556 --> 25:14.245
Vandiver, he wanted to do away with the Corps. And I 
said, well, he's crazy. I said, the Morrill Act

25:17.219 --> 25:25.053
says A&M is going to be put up there because we need a 
school of agriculture. There was no other place.

25:27.156 --> 25:33.628
And in addition to that, it says there will be 
military training at that place. So Mr. Vandiver

25:33.648 --> 25:36.773
cannot do away with it. And we're going to have 
people like that, sir, that are going to stop

25:37.259 --> 25:43.848
certain traditions. And I want to tell those 
people, don't listen to that crap. I say, you keep

25:48.474 --> 25:55.644
this thing going, and it's the only one in the world 
that's like this, that I know of. And you keep that

25:57.026 --> 26:04.295
going, and then if there's hostilities come up, 
who's going to get the first call? A&M. So it

26:06.757 --> 26:14.188
behooves you to just make no changes and improve on 
it.

26:14.208 --> 26:17.212
All right, we're almost through with the 
questions I've thought of. Have you thought of

26:17.272 --> 26:21.438
some things we've left out we should have covered? 
No, sir. All right, then among the last questions,

26:25.264 --> 26:34.637
what difference has it made in your life that you 
attended Texas A&M?

26:38.178 --> 26:53.159
We

26:38.178 --> 26:53.159
met a lot of people in high places, especially my 
wife. My wife is a gung-ho Aggie, I tell you. And we

26:57.224 --> 27:06.497
belong to the San Antonio A&M Club, and she belongs 
to the A&M Mothers.

27:07.355 --> 27:08.757
And you don't have to put this on there.

27:12.964 --> 27:16.389
She was president of the federation. Mm-hm. The 
whole state, plus our organization in Louisiana

27:18.192 --> 27:24.822
and someplace else. And this is just between us.

27:34.237 --> 27:35.218
Bound to doles. was the biggest crook, in my 
opinion, when it deals with trying to sell their

27:35.840 --> 27:43.970
wares without competition.

27:46.513 --> 27:52.161
And Bob Smith, I hate his guts for what he did. So he 
wanted to set up a place, a cafeteria, a dining

27:54.283 --> 28:03.535
hall. and set it here on a compass. And just before 
that, A&M had gotten a lot of publicity on the way

28:07.871 --> 28:20.127
our dining halls were being run by these people 
that were good. Among the best in the nation. The

28:21.709 --> 28:23.671
best in the nation. And Mr. Bob Smith was going to do 
it the other way, see. Now, we didn't know about

28:27.596 --> 28:33.083
this until the kids were riding home. I need more 
money. Why? Well, the price of food's going to go up

28:36.126 --> 28:38.388
and all this. So Margaret Freeman, Margaret 
Freeman was the president of the Federation, and

28:39.409 --> 28:48.819
her wife was there to help her. They said, hey, 
that's a bunch of bull. So those two ladies

28:52.022 --> 29:00.311
questioned Mr. Bob Smith and who was the 
president, I mean the chairman of the regents.

29:00.331 --> 29:01.112
He's a lawyer. I don't know, because there are a 
bunch of lawyers. Well, he was the chairman at the

29:04.120 --> 29:05.842
time. He was in on that deal. And they started 
asking questions, and Bob Smith couldn't give the

29:09.426 --> 29:13.670
answers. Then the governor, that woman, what was 
her name? Ann Richards. Ann Richards. She got wind

29:23.521 --> 29:24.361
of it. Bob Smith went to her and said, you know, 
there's two girls over there. really nitpicking

29:28.784 --> 29:32.490
me and I don't have the answers. And they were 
getting liquor up there for certain people, you

29:33.231 --> 29:42.104
know, to benefit this chairman and Bob Smith. So 
they did enough digging, digging, digging, until

29:42.605 --> 29:47.252
something happened. And then Bob Smith was okay. 
All because of Margaret Freeman and Rachel

29:50.717 --> 29:54.202
Gonzalez. If they hadn't done that, I don't know 
where we'd be. This is the kind of thing I'm saying,

29:58.855 --> 30:03.020
hey, all this is no good. Get it out and prove 
anything. So I just, I can't think of this

30:06.043 --> 30:14.633
chairman's name. He's an attorney. In Houston. He 
got out. He resigned. Otherwise, you couldn't

30:19.619 --> 30:22.542
imagine what was going on. So my wife, knows a lot of 
A&M mothers all over the state. And she's just

30:35.322 --> 30:38.066
nutty. She's crazy about A&M. And you better not 
say anything ugly. And sometimes we'll go to some

30:42.552 --> 30:52.045
meeting and the speaker says, well I want to start, 
I want to tell you a naggy joke. And I'm like, no you

30:52.065 --> 30:54.528
won't. I don't want to hear no naggy jokes. You get 
down to business. And the speaker, you know, he

30:58.542 --> 31:02.866
don't want to say, he doesn't say the actual. 
That's how she loves A&M, see. And then it flows to

31:07.451 --> 31:10.774
me and my son the same way. Don't say nothing bad 
about A&M.

31:16.139 --> 31:17.200
Next to last question. Somebody walks up to you and 
gives you a check for a million dollars with one

31:18.802 --> 31:25.208
condition. You must pass it on to Texas A&M, but you 
get to decide how it would be used.
