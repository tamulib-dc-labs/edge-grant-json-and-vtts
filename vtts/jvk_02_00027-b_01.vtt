WEBVTT

00:00:02.275 --> 00:00:17.679
Something that I would like to know, and I would think it would be interesting if you could find out for the purpose, is who told Jack Williams that he would not teach a history class at A&M after he was no longer chancellor?

00:00:18.661 --> 00:00:19.963
I don't have any idea.

00:00:20.824 --> 00:00:21.365
I don't know.

00:00:22.987 --> 00:00:24.850
Because I think he did want to.

00:00:24.890 --> 00:00:25.952
Oh, I know he wanted to.

00:00:26.453 --> 00:00:28.536
That I know, both simply because

00:00:30.102 --> 00:00:32.566
was over at former students for coffee.

00:00:33.027 --> 00:00:34.169
He was over there.

00:00:34.189 --> 00:00:42.224
He gets a phone call and it was Keith Bryant calling him, asking him about textbook or something.

00:00:42.444 --> 00:00:52.262
And he was so excited talking to Keith on the telephone right there while we were sitting around trying to have coffee about what he's gonna do in the class and he's planning and textbooks and all this sort of stuff.

00:00:52.242 --> 00:01:03.778
And I also know for a fact that although most people on campus thought that word came down through Prescott that he wasn't going to teach, but Mack was shocked when Keith called to tell him.

00:01:04.279 --> 00:01:08.985
Because as dean of faculties, it was a shock to me.

00:01:09.085 --> 00:01:09.566
Yeah.

00:01:09.586 --> 00:01:12.070
It certainly didn't go through normal channels.

00:01:12.130 --> 00:01:13.151
Through normal channels.

00:01:15.314 --> 00:01:16.396
Somebody called him.

00:01:17.016 --> 00:01:18.358
And he's the one who called Keith.

00:01:18.478 --> 00:01:20.441
And I've always wondered who it was.

00:01:21.643 --> 00:01:21.743
Yeah.

00:01:22.162 --> 00:01:27.949
Bob Cherry was the most likely suspect, but I'm not sure he would have taken it seriously had he been Cherry.

00:01:28.510 --> 00:01:29.451
Yeah, I don't know.

00:01:29.471 --> 00:01:30.853
I don't know.

00:01:31.894 --> 00:01:32.675
Let's see.

00:01:33.677 --> 00:01:48.996
Back to admissions and records, was there any regent or alum, former student, that was most active in speaking up for special admits?

00:01:50.613 --> 00:01:53.837
Not that I recall.

00:01:53.917 --> 00:02:00.724
And we're talking about a dozen or so a semester, or are we talking about dozens?

00:02:01.124 --> 00:02:03.367
If you're talking about September, you're talking about dozens.

00:02:03.447 --> 00:02:04.648
Dozens, okay.

00:02:04.989 --> 00:02:06.590
Now.

00:02:06.610 --> 00:02:08.633
And it was normally entering students, freshmen?

00:02:08.753 --> 00:02:09.834
Yeah, occasionally transfer.

00:02:10.495 --> 00:02:11.976
Almost never graduate.

00:02:13.178 --> 00:02:17.262
And to be admitted to the College of Veterinary Medicine,

00:02:17.849 --> 00:02:24.135
everybody pretty well backed off and realized that they couldn't.

00:02:24.676 --> 00:02:28.159
I'm assuming that Cooper included the Oscar Wyatt story.

00:02:28.320 --> 00:02:30.482
Yes, yes.

00:02:31.222 --> 00:02:32.043
Okay.

00:02:32.143 --> 00:02:46.658
I was in Williams' office when one of those phone calls came, so I heard that, and I heard Oscar Wyatt cuss Dr. Williams and use some very strong language and tell him, I'm going to get you.

00:02:47.161 --> 00:02:54.874
The person that he wanted, Mr. Wyatt wanted admitted was his secretary's son or nephew or something rather.

00:02:55.815 --> 00:03:04.309
And as I recall Dr. Williams having the paper before him, the young man was nowhere, nowhere, nowhere close.

00:03:04.525 --> 00:03:15.961
Some years or several years after that, and Mr. White did the classic taking off my ring, take me off the list, you know, statement.

00:03:17.003 --> 00:03:21.890
I was in a staff meeting for Cooper and Bill Lay was late.

00:03:23.091 --> 00:03:24.854
And he came in apologizing to me.

00:03:24.874 --> 00:03:30.482
He said, I had some guy named White on the phone and I couldn't get off the phone with him trying to get some Italian kids admitted.

00:03:30.462 --> 00:03:36.635
And just to make, say something smarter, like I said, as in Oscar, I mean, I said, as in Wyatt Earp.

00:03:37.016 --> 00:03:39.181
He said, no, no, Wyatt was his last name.

00:03:39.722 --> 00:03:41.165
I said, as in Oscar Wyatt?

00:03:41.506 --> 00:03:42.668
Yeah, yeah, that was his name.

00:03:43.069 --> 00:03:44.472
Well, Cooper turns pale.

00:03:46.561 --> 00:03:48.063
Bill didn't know who the guy is.

00:03:48.404 --> 00:03:50.627
He didn't have a clue who he was.

00:03:50.647 --> 00:03:52.610
Cooper turns pale, and he says, are you sure it was Oscar?

00:03:52.630 --> 00:03:56.115
He said, yeah, he's trying to get these Italian kids admitted.

00:03:56.416 --> 00:04:02.465
People that work for their parents are going to show up next week, and he wants us to admit them.

00:04:02.485 --> 00:04:06.731
And he said, if everything's on the level, they can be admitted.

00:04:06.751 --> 00:04:07.553
And everything was.

00:04:07.573 --> 00:04:09.776
I mean, we had these three Italian kids.

00:04:10.076 --> 00:04:11.218
Oh, so it worked okay.

00:04:11.198 --> 00:04:12.059
It worked fine.

00:04:12.180 --> 00:04:16.606
These three Italian kids, this was in a time when young people were being kidnapped in Italy.

00:04:17.367 --> 00:04:19.651
And these were from the Fiat family.

00:04:20.833 --> 00:04:27.503
And they were trying to get them in a nice, safe place, and one of them wanted to study agronomy, so they sent them to A&M.

00:04:27.854 --> 00:04:32.561
Did you ever hear any anecdotes about someone offering money to get somebody admitted?

00:04:33.522 --> 00:04:34.103
No.

00:04:34.123 --> 00:04:35.405
I never did hear any of that.

00:04:35.425 --> 00:04:37.047
No.

00:04:37.327 --> 00:04:39.451
Did you ever hear of the governor calling?

00:04:39.511 --> 00:04:40.252
I never heard that.

00:04:40.392 --> 00:04:41.874
Or someone from the governor's office?

00:04:44.838 --> 00:04:47.702
Not that I remember, no.

00:04:47.883 --> 00:04:55.954
It was usually state senators and state representatives they called.

00:04:56.204 --> 00:05:00.590
And particularly Aggies who were state representatives.

00:05:00.610 --> 00:05:00.730
Yes.

00:05:01.030 --> 00:05:14.307
I don't remember anybody from the Association of Former Student Staff doing anything other than conveying the message.

00:05:15.348 --> 00:05:18.372
I don't remember any of them ever trying to intervene.

00:05:20.655 --> 00:05:22.397
No.

00:05:23.288 --> 00:05:30.960
All right, and how would you describe the relationship of the former student office and its leadership to the university?

00:05:32.342 --> 00:05:32.923
Then or now?

00:05:33.564 --> 00:05:33.785
Then.

00:05:37.170 --> 00:05:39.313
It was a very close relationship.

00:05:40.896 --> 00:05:44.481
I adored Buckwires.

00:05:44.822 --> 00:05:51.152
He was squirrely as he could be, and yet he ran a very good program somehow.

00:05:54.592 --> 00:06:01.948
Buck, even though he worked for the association, saw himself more as a, more connected to the university.

00:06:03.150 --> 00:06:13.433
Randy does too, but Randy fully gives evidence of showing that he works for the association more.

00:06:13.513 --> 00:06:14.575
It's just an attitude.

00:06:14.555 --> 00:06:25.307
I consider Randy Mattson a close friend, and I'm very, very fond of him.

00:06:26.840 --> 00:06:28.823
I think he's got one of the world's toughest jobs.

00:06:28.843 --> 00:06:29.303
Oh, I do, too.

00:06:30.485 --> 00:06:39.877
And he's one I admire him as much as anybody I've ever known, because I met him the day he came as a prospective student when John Lindsay and Jack Knox brought him.

00:06:40.678 --> 00:06:43.441
I'll tell you a funny story that can be told on here.

00:06:43.802 --> 00:06:45.664
Okay.

00:06:47.206 --> 00:06:55.817
The day after Buck Wires was fired, the morning after, his counterpart at the University of Texas at Austin, Roy Vaughn,

00:06:56.118 --> 00:06:57.259
called Olive DeLucia.

00:06:59.021 --> 00:07:09.472
And when Olive picked up the phone, without saying, hi, Olive, this is Roy, he growled, did Randy get Buck's job?

00:07:10.473 --> 00:07:13.496
In other words, did he stab Buck?

00:07:14.978 --> 00:07:19.122
And Olive's response was, Roy, Randy saved Buck's ass.

00:07:21.485 --> 00:07:24.808
Then he said, oh, okay.

00:07:27.185 --> 00:07:34.495
Let's see, you were in the Registrar's Office of Admissions and Records how long?

00:07:34.675 --> 00:07:35.596
Until 78.

00:07:35.616 --> 00:07:35.977
78.

00:07:36.678 --> 00:07:37.779
So that's how many years?

00:07:38.640 --> 00:07:38.741
Five.

00:07:38.761 --> 00:07:39.402
Five.

00:07:39.422 --> 00:07:39.762
And then?

00:07:41.004 --> 00:07:44.629
Went to work in the Vice President for Academic Affairs Office.

00:07:44.649 --> 00:07:45.049
Okay.

00:07:45.610 --> 00:07:51.338
And with, let's see, we were in the Koch building then.

00:07:52.379 --> 00:07:54.802
And what was your duties there?

00:07:55.163 --> 00:07:56.044
Whatever I was told.

00:07:56.783 --> 00:07:59.647
Or what did that end up being primarily?

00:08:01.008 --> 00:08:11.421
Writing letters and reports and troubleshooting and whatever, and drafting and editing stuff, and just whatever needed to be done.

00:08:12.122 --> 00:08:20.353
I had the job for two weeks before I knew what I was going to get paid, but I did negotiate a parking place in the lot next to the building before I took it.

00:08:21.554 --> 00:08:26.200
The interesting thing to me about that job was when I left it,

00:08:28.745 --> 00:08:35.852
Probably eight or ten faculty members either called or came to see me wanting to apply for the job.

00:08:37.823 --> 00:08:40.186
And I kept telling them, you don't know what I do.

00:08:41.147 --> 00:08:43.870
And you don't want the pay cut.

00:08:43.930 --> 00:08:47.355
No way you want to work for what I've been making.

00:08:48.196 --> 00:08:51.340
And, oh well, we'll do something about that.

00:08:51.360 --> 00:08:53.442
And I said, I don't think you want to do what I've been doing.

00:08:54.343 --> 00:09:02.633
So you reported to Mack Prescott, Vice President Prescott, because we didn't call it Provost then.

00:09:02.673 --> 00:09:02.854
No.

00:09:03.494 --> 00:09:05.637
And there was McCandless.

00:09:06.612 --> 00:09:08.576
And he was already there, wasn't he?

00:09:08.676 --> 00:09:13.206
Well, he was across the – no, he was director of institutional planning and analysis.

00:09:13.226 --> 00:09:14.008
Oh, he was still that.

00:09:14.269 --> 00:09:14.569
Okay.

00:09:14.589 --> 00:09:14.750
Yeah.

00:09:15.491 --> 00:09:15.792
All right.

00:09:15.932 --> 00:09:17.295
And I was dean of faculties.

00:09:17.315 --> 00:09:20.402
And who else was there that was reporting directly to Mac?

00:09:22.728 --> 00:09:26.837
Well, all the deans, of course, and assorted directors of different things.

00:09:26.958 --> 00:09:27.078
Right.

00:09:27.098 --> 00:09:28.682
There wasn't anybody else in the Cochrane.

00:09:28.702 --> 00:09:29.283
Jeanette.

00:09:29.303 --> 00:09:30.245
And Jeanette Ferris.

00:09:30.265 --> 00:09:31.388
Yeah.

00:09:31.689 --> 00:09:37.602
Describe Jeanette's style of keeping all the office going.

00:09:37.622 --> 00:09:41.952
Jeanette does a very good job, ain't she?

00:09:45.762 --> 00:09:48.945
will work incredibly hard, incredibly long hours.

00:09:51.348 --> 00:09:53.730
She can get awfully excited about things.

00:09:54.291 --> 00:09:55.953
Jeanette thinks everything's a crisis.

00:09:56.633 --> 00:09:59.376
Everything is an emergency, which is probably good in that job.

00:10:04.061 --> 00:10:06.824
She gets along well with the people who work for her.

00:10:07.765 --> 00:10:14.892
She has worked for a succession of vice presidents for academic affairs.

00:10:14.872 --> 00:10:22.403
Eventually she pretty well gets them all straightened out.

00:10:22.964 --> 00:10:27.872
Did Mack give you any steering directions when you first joined his group?

00:10:28.352 --> 00:10:28.553
No.

00:10:29.815 --> 00:10:30.776
Just that he needed some help.

00:10:31.577 --> 00:10:35.503
And you were a new – you didn't replace anybody.

00:10:35.643 --> 00:10:37.867
You were a new – that's what I thought.

00:10:39.249 --> 00:10:39.369
Yeah.

00:10:40.651 --> 00:10:43.275
Describe President Miller's staff.

00:10:43.762 --> 00:10:52.203
President Miller had a secretary and an undersecretary, so to speak, and two assistants, Steve Pringle and Glenn Daly.

00:10:52.464 --> 00:10:54.008
And how were their duties divided?

00:10:54.292 --> 00:10:59.621
Glenn took care of things that were important, and Steve took care of everything else.

00:11:01.544 --> 00:11:02.646
No, that's not quite true.

00:11:03.127 --> 00:11:03.969
That's not quite true.

00:11:04.129 --> 00:11:17.792
Steve worked more external types of things, and I've never seen anyone who could get in more messes than he could, could make people angrier than he could, and yet I always got along fine with him.

00:11:17.932 --> 00:11:19.455
I had no problems at all working with him.

00:11:20.060 --> 00:11:24.886
Let's see, had Emory Ballard already resigned when you got over there?

00:11:27.849 --> 00:11:29.892
He resigns in the middle of the fall.

00:11:32.535 --> 00:11:33.176
I think so.

00:11:33.516 --> 00:11:38.402
I think I came in January, February.

00:11:38.663 --> 00:11:41.106
Okay, all right.

00:11:41.126 --> 00:11:47.974
As far as you were aware, important decisions under the Miller presidency were made how?

00:11:48.882 --> 00:11:55.771
Who were the people that most were key to the way things were decided?

00:11:59.556 --> 00:12:06.104
I think Dr. Miller didn't really trust an awful lot of people.

00:12:07.766 --> 00:12:12.392
He did trust Prescott and Howard Vestal.

00:12:14.009 --> 00:12:17.635
I think he got to where he did, but I don't think he started out that way.

00:12:19.519 --> 00:12:30.718
He didn't think CODIS frequently was firm enough on things.

00:12:38.950 --> 00:12:41.853
I have known members of Dr. Miller's family all of my life.

00:12:42.353 --> 00:12:44.295
My father knew previous generations.

00:12:46.437 --> 00:12:50.001
My dad always said the Millers are awfully good people, but they're different.

00:12:51.522 --> 00:12:54.005
And they are.

00:12:54.025 --> 00:13:06.477
Dr. Miller saw things, saw people as very, he either really, really liked you, in which case he'd do anything in the world for you, or he really, really didn't like you, in which case he would go out of his way to hurt you.

00:13:07.368 --> 00:13:16.959
And if he didn't know you very well, he would give you the benefit of the doubt, but eventually you were going to fall in one of those camps as he got to know you.

00:13:18.621 --> 00:13:32.398
Were you aware of any of the disagreements between Hubert as chancellor and Miller as president?

00:13:32.418 --> 00:13:32.558
Mm-hmm.

00:13:32.578 --> 00:13:35.822
And to me, see, I had taken a course under Hubert.

00:13:37.321 --> 00:13:45.103
And essentially, the administration of higher education

00:13:46.822 --> 00:13:49.024
And I also remember the day Hubert was named.

00:13:49.525 --> 00:13:53.048
I was in Austin that day with George Kunze at the coordinating board.

00:13:54.069 --> 00:14:00.076
And Kunze gets a call from his office, and they're calling to tell him that Hubert's just been named chancellor.

00:14:01.437 --> 00:14:03.379
We get back to the Koch building.

00:14:03.780 --> 00:14:05.641
Dr. Miller is the happiest man there.

00:14:06.182 --> 00:14:06.943
He is thrilled.

00:14:08.024 --> 00:14:09.746
He thinks it's the neatest thing in the world.

00:14:10.166 --> 00:14:11.007
And I'm thinking,

00:14:11.273 --> 00:14:12.976
You don't know Frank Hubert as well as I do.

00:14:15.541 --> 00:14:17.806
He means to be boss, if that's his title.

00:14:19.309 --> 00:14:22.154
And it was inevitable.

00:14:22.896 --> 00:14:25.100
I mean, it was just inevitable.

00:14:26.082 --> 00:14:33.737
I feel certain that Hubert had not had a great deal of respect for him for some time.

00:14:35.422 --> 00:14:46.554
And as far as I know, almost from the first moment, the argument centered on where the services and the stations reported.

00:14:48.116 --> 00:15:03.994
And I and the vice presidents two or three times in the late afternoon after everybody else was gone and talking to President Miller, we would say, look, Hubert's going to retire in three or four years.

00:15:04.953 --> 00:15:08.197
And if you play your cards right, you'll end up there.

00:15:08.237 --> 00:15:14.206
And when you were director of the experiment station, you didn't want to report to the president.

00:15:15.607 --> 00:15:26.863
And my recollection is that late in that spring of 1980, he agreed that, yes, he ought to back off and leave it be.

00:15:28.445 --> 00:15:30.027
I don't think that was the real issue.

00:15:30.307 --> 00:15:32.230
What else was?

00:15:33.211 --> 00:15:34.453
Oh, no.

00:15:36.340 --> 00:15:38.662
If it hadn't been that, it would have been something else.

00:15:38.682 --> 00:15:39.483
Oh, I agree with you.

00:15:39.683 --> 00:15:40.564
Let me put it that way.

00:15:40.604 --> 00:15:44.107
That was a real issue, but there would have been another one.

00:15:44.167 --> 00:15:44.728
No, I agree.

00:15:45.028 --> 00:15:45.308
I agree.

00:15:46.329 --> 00:16:03.445
I think that was the fuse of... You were one of them, but it was my impression that there wasn't a great deal of respect for Miller among the deans.

00:16:05.872 --> 00:16:18.729
They knew he was president, they respected that, but they didn't think he really understood how things worked.

00:16:18.870 --> 00:16:20.775
As far as you know,

00:16:21.245 --> 00:16:29.156
academic matters he listened to Prescott, and business matters he listened to Vestal.

00:16:31.400 --> 00:16:35.906
Let's talk about this man Vestal a bit, because I've got to go interview him.

00:16:37.609 --> 00:16:42.055
What kind of style did he give you, his operating style and manner?

00:16:43.503 --> 00:16:47.107
Well Howard Vestal was one of the colonels who came here.

00:16:47.147 --> 00:16:54.094
Rutter hired a lot of colonels because he figured they were intelligent and they'd work cheap because they already had an outside income.

00:16:56.876 --> 00:16:58.418
But Vestal was one of the smart ones.

00:16:58.798 --> 00:17:02.782
No one ever called him Colonel Vestal, except joking.

00:17:05.165 --> 00:17:11.451
He was extremely capable, had a

00:17:12.916 --> 00:17:30.601
a leadership, whatever there was about Howard Vestal, I knew immediately when I had passed the test, I didn't know what the test was, but I knew I'd passed it, and I was very pleased to have passed it.

00:17:30.621 --> 00:17:31.603
Does that make any sense?

00:17:33.846 --> 00:17:37.170
He called to warn me about something, a mistake he thought I had made.

00:17:37.210 --> 00:17:42.518
And I told him, I said, Mr. Vestal, I didn't do that.

00:17:43.645 --> 00:17:45.388
And he was giving me a chance to correct it.

00:17:45.749 --> 00:17:48.053
I said, I didn't do that and told him who had done it.

00:17:48.754 --> 00:17:54.164
And he said, in that case, I won't lift a finger to help.

00:17:54.184 --> 00:17:55.346
And so I knew I'd passed it.

00:17:55.386 --> 00:17:57.990
He was trying to keep me out of trouble, you know.

00:17:58.471 --> 00:18:01.597
And I was very, very pleased.

00:18:02.358 --> 00:18:07.948
And I don't know, how would you describe someone that I didn't, I never worked for him.

00:18:08.249 --> 00:18:11.112
But I had an awful lot of respect for him, and I think people did.

00:18:11.172 --> 00:18:15.456
Again, he got mad for the right reasons.

00:18:16.777 --> 00:18:19.439
He did things for the right reasons.

00:18:20.961 --> 00:18:36.535
And I got the impression from him, well, in fact, from Coldis, too, but from Vestal, Prescott, and Coldis, you don't need a big committee, you don't need a long time,

00:18:37.038 --> 00:18:41.122
here's the material, let's study it, let's come to a conclusion, and let's go.

00:18:42.183 --> 00:18:47.749
Vestal had another trait that you don't often or you don't always see in people who handle the money.

00:18:49.691 --> 00:18:53.094
He knew what we were here for, and it wasn't to count money.

00:18:55.176 --> 00:18:57.659
We were here to educate kids.

00:18:57.679 --> 00:19:04.125
And that came through time and again, time and again.

00:19:05.084 --> 00:19:12.074
And I can't cite specific instances, but, you know, that was his attitude.

00:19:12.635 --> 00:19:17.982
And I say that's not always as much as I liked and respected Tom Cherry.

00:19:18.002 --> 00:19:22.148
I'm not sure that Mr. Cherry had it to that much of extent.

00:19:24.110 --> 00:19:28.356
And I'm not at all sure that we do now.

00:19:29.738 --> 00:19:29.999
All right.

00:19:30.019 --> 00:19:34.585
As we're heading toward the spring of 1980,

00:19:35.155 --> 00:19:48.994
Were you at the commencement on Saturday in the spring of 1980 when the president of the Texas A&M did not shake hands with the last degree recipient?

00:19:49.014 --> 00:19:49.074
No.

00:19:49.235 --> 00:19:49.735
Mercifully.

00:19:50.076 --> 00:19:50.436
Okay.

00:19:50.737 --> 00:19:51.157
I was.

00:19:51.298 --> 00:19:58.848
I have made so many commencement ceremonies, probably Cooper and Carter are the only two people who have been to more of them, but I didn't go to that one.

00:19:59.589 --> 00:19:59.709
Right.

00:19:59.729 --> 00:20:03.154
What did you hear, as you understood it, what happened?

00:20:03.809 --> 00:20:12.199
As I understood it, what happened is the President handed her a diploma, and when she stuck out her hand to shake it, he turned his back.

00:20:13.560 --> 00:20:21.330
I'm sitting on the front row next to Bill Hobby, because he had motioned for me to come up and sit next to him.

00:20:21.530 --> 00:20:22.311
Was he still awake?

00:20:22.992 --> 00:20:30.540
Oh, and we'd had a real good conversation, and he had said, when you get out to UTEP, I've known you for 20 years, stay in contact.

00:20:30.921 --> 00:20:32.803
Maybe I can help you with some special items.

00:20:33.188 --> 00:20:43.880
and we're chatting and then I said well gee it's about time now when we don't have many more to go I'm going to move back to my real seat on the back row and all at once I hear hissing.

00:20:45.722 --> 00:20:46.723
And I said oh my goodness.

00:20:46.763 --> 00:20:48.024
He said what's that?

00:20:48.104 --> 00:20:51.288
And I said well particularly the corps members are hissing.

00:20:51.328 --> 00:20:52.469
There's something they don't like.

00:20:52.529 --> 00:20:52.969
What is it?

00:20:53.770 --> 00:20:56.293
And then I saw Melanie Zentgraf coming up

00:20:57.151 --> 00:20:58.052
on the right.

00:20:58.232 --> 00:21:08.963
I learned later that her family thought that we had deliberately scheduled it where that she would be the last degree recipient at the last of the three commencements that spring.

00:21:10.165 --> 00:21:19.795
Well, I was the one who was to work with Ed Cooper to decide which schools and colleges were on which of the three times, and we always tried to rotate it.

00:21:20.596 --> 00:21:24.880
But since she was biomedical science in veterinary medicine undergraduate,

00:21:25.535 --> 00:21:27.037
And her name began with a Z.

00:21:28.158 --> 00:21:28.258
A Z.

00:21:29.600 --> 00:21:36.328
And Lieutenant Governor Hobby then, when I mentioned her name, he said, oh my goodness, she's been a pain in my rear.

00:21:36.889 --> 00:21:38.531
She's given me all kinds of trouble.

00:21:38.571 --> 00:21:40.293
She's pestered us in Austin.

00:21:41.415 --> 00:21:44.338
Gee my knee, I wish I wasn't sitting here.

00:21:46.000 --> 00:21:49.905
And as I recall it, when Dr. Miller handed

00:21:50.223 --> 00:21:55.768
By being the last one, everybody has kind of cleared the, looking up there, okay, the last one will all come.

00:21:55.788 --> 00:21:56.068
Wake up.

00:21:56.528 --> 00:21:56.789
Right.

00:21:57.389 --> 00:21:59.951
He handed her the diploma tube.

00:22:00.952 --> 00:22:13.363
She took it, not with her left hand, as would be normal, with her right, then shifted it to her left hand, put her hand back out, and as I recall, he said very lowly, no way I'm going to shake your hand.

00:22:15.064 --> 00:22:17.746
Many people kind of took a deep breath.

00:22:18.507 --> 00:22:19.808
She turned to Bob Lacey.

00:22:20.581 --> 00:22:23.907
and put out her hand and he said, ma'am I'm not involved in this argument.

00:22:26.251 --> 00:22:32.341
Don Carter said, would you please keep the line moving as was his norm.

00:22:32.361 --> 00:22:37.830
And when we get into the letterman's lounge afterward to take off our caps and gowns,

00:22:38.215 --> 00:22:46.723
That was a topic of conversation and I heard a number of board members particularly say serves her right to heck with her or worse than that.

00:22:47.083 --> 00:22:49.966
I wouldn't have shaken her hands either and nobody ought to shake her hand.

00:22:51.267 --> 00:22:53.490
All right.

00:22:53.510 --> 00:23:06.602
Were you aware, did you hear any rumors about the board doing anything prior to their termination of Dr. Miller?

00:23:07.274 --> 00:23:08.836
I wasn't either.

00:23:09.737 --> 00:23:15.123
And that happened the week that we left to move to El Paso.

00:23:16.104 --> 00:23:21.590
And the first morning we were there, I'm awakened by reporters.

00:23:22.270 --> 00:23:30.920
Mac had called me late the night before and left a message, but we didn't get the message until three hours later, and by then it was 1130 Central Time.

00:23:32.081 --> 00:23:36.606
Tell us a machine a minute.

00:23:39.792 --> 00:23:45.060
Obviously some of the Hubert stuff, there's some other things that you're not ever gonna get in here.

00:23:45.621 --> 00:23:46.943
Oh, I agree, I agree.

00:23:47.344 --> 00:23:48.305
Okay.

00:23:48.325 --> 00:23:56.158
And let's see, we were moving toward when Dr. Miller was terminated by the Bulwarks.

00:23:56.178 --> 00:23:56.258
Yes.

00:23:56.458 --> 00:24:02.087
What was the general reaction of the people that you worked with most closely?

00:24:02.472 --> 00:24:05.696
Absolutely stunned just that it could happen.

00:24:06.397 --> 00:24:17.470
State employees and university employees live in a, it's not the real world, and they don't, they're always shocked when these things happen more frequently in the real world.

00:24:18.651 --> 00:24:23.157
And let's see, the office was, the president's office was still in the Koch building.

00:24:24.859 --> 00:24:29.965
On Monday, because the next Monday,

00:24:30.502 --> 00:24:33.027
Was he already gone from the office?

00:24:33.247 --> 00:24:33.608
I don't know.

00:24:34.890 --> 00:24:35.411
I think so.

00:24:35.672 --> 00:24:36.654
I don't think he ever came back.

00:24:37.495 --> 00:24:45.010
The only time I saw him, about six weeks later.

00:24:46.192 --> 00:24:48.937
I was working late one night.

00:24:48.957 --> 00:24:51.362
And he shows up up there to have some typing done.

00:24:53.806 --> 00:25:19.105
and he's writing something and he came in and asked me if i'd come proof it for him and the typing that was being done and we're sitting there and waiting for typing and i'm proofing and back and forth and he looks me in the eye and said mary helen i didn't get a letter from you after i left office

00:25:21.127 --> 00:25:23.251
And I said, Dr. Miller, I know you didn't.

00:25:23.271 --> 00:25:28.682
And I said, I guess the reason was I didn't know what I'd say because I knew how hurt you must be.

00:25:31.868 --> 00:25:34.895
And I guess that was okay.

00:25:37.079 --> 00:25:38.001
I did get a call.

00:25:38.822 --> 00:25:40.165
I got back to my office.

00:25:41.410 --> 00:25:54.669
And everybody was so excited because Jerry Cooper from former students had been over trying to find a picture of Dr. Miller that we had in our files to put on the cover of the Texas Aggie the next month.

00:25:56.011 --> 00:25:58.674
And I had asked them to gather up all their Dr. Miller pictures.

00:25:58.995 --> 00:26:01.178
And I said, okay, you gather them up and you bring them to my office.

00:26:02.620 --> 00:26:03.882
And I worried about it all night.

00:26:04.903 --> 00:26:11.232
And I called Randy the next morning and I said, Randy, we're not going to provide you with a picture of Dr. Miller for the cover of the Texas Aggie.

00:26:12.629 --> 00:26:13.831
And he said, why not?

00:26:15.193 --> 00:26:19.099
And I said, because I have a sneaking suspicion I know what your cover would look like.

00:26:20.001 --> 00:26:22.785
And I've heard some rumors, ideas that have been discussed.

00:26:23.767 --> 00:26:28.014
And the truth of the matter is, I work for Texas A&M University and for the Board of Regents.

00:26:29.095 --> 00:26:32.961
And I figure it'll take them about 30 seconds to figure out where you got the picture.

00:26:34.764 --> 00:26:38.991
And they have every right to expect that I wouldn't.

00:26:39.595 --> 00:26:42.386
And Randy said, Mary Helen, you're exactly right.

00:26:42.426 --> 00:26:45.036
We never considered what position we were putting you in.

00:26:45.077 --> 00:26:46.703
Don't worry about it.

00:26:48.252 --> 00:27:00.387
They, I've forgotten what, they ended up running an old one they had of him, but they were highly, the association was highly critical of the board for firing Dr. Fuller.

00:27:00.428 --> 00:27:03.912
He had far more support there than he had, I think, among faculty.

00:27:04.332 --> 00:27:07.276
I don't think faculty, for the most part, disliked him, they just didn't know him.

00:27:08.338 --> 00:27:10.260
Right, right.

00:27:11.742 --> 00:27:26.823
In terms of politics, did during those years that you were part of the vice president's staff, did you have any real-world political task?

00:27:27.644 --> 00:27:28.325
Occasionally.

00:27:28.645 --> 00:27:32.130
With what politicians?

00:27:34.321 --> 00:27:40.067
Mostly just making sure that they were treated well when they were on campus.

00:27:40.867 --> 00:27:48.054
Helped put together a day-long meeting for Governor Clements right after he was elected and all of his staff.

00:27:48.755 --> 00:28:02.488
That was also pretty funny because we had, it was in the summer and the governor had come out with his edict that all state buildings would be kept at temperature 78, all

00:28:03.278 --> 00:28:13.033
Men, employees, would wear shirt sleeves, no coats and ties that summer, and the governor had good sense to say, and the ladies would know how to dress.

00:28:14.555 --> 00:28:17.239
But when that meeting, we had a spy out at the airport.

00:28:17.360 --> 00:28:19.002
We were not supposed to greet them at the airport.

00:28:19.022 --> 00:28:20.044
This was a working meeting.

00:28:20.564 --> 00:28:26.073
We had a spy out there to see if they got off the plane in shirt sleeves, and they did.

00:28:26.373 --> 00:28:29.438
And so all of the guys had shown up over at the regent's quarters,

00:28:29.418 --> 00:28:33.224
in short-sleeved white shirts and ties and coats.

00:28:33.545 --> 00:28:43.281
So we hid the ties and coats in a closet and giggled about how much it had cost to pump hot water in there to get the temperature.

00:28:43.341 --> 00:28:48.549
They had really worked hard to get the temperature up to 78 degrees on the chill water system.

00:28:51.774 --> 00:28:55.881
Other political realities that you recall?

00:28:56.131 --> 00:29:09.362
I recall putting together, I'm not sure what you're driving at here, but putting together a lot of information in support of various programs that we were working on.

00:29:12.390 --> 00:29:13.853
I recall

00:29:13.833 --> 00:29:17.859
writing, rewriting a lot of information other people had put together for it.

00:29:19.261 --> 00:29:20.363
I'm not sure.

00:29:20.924 --> 00:29:24.869
Well, I was thinking about receptions, parties coming.

00:29:25.010 --> 00:29:25.330
Oh, yes.

00:29:25.671 --> 00:29:26.031
Always.

00:29:26.111 --> 00:29:27.153
Politicians coming to.

00:29:27.173 --> 00:29:30.798
Coming and going and listening to them.

00:29:30.818 --> 00:29:33.823
I mean, that's gone on always.

00:29:34.304 --> 00:29:43.317
Of all those, regardless of where you were, where your task was, which political figures do you recall with greatest joy?

00:29:44.596 --> 00:29:45.377
Which one?

00:29:45.397 --> 00:29:45.978
Rick Perry.

00:29:46.979 --> 00:29:47.299
Really?

00:29:47.900 --> 00:29:51.825
As representative or as commissioner of agriculture?

00:29:51.845 --> 00:29:53.207
As commissioner of agriculture.

00:29:53.227 --> 00:29:55.330
Okay.

00:29:56.151 --> 00:30:04.201
President Bush came here right before he left office as president, and he gave a major foreign policy speech in G. Raleigh White.

00:30:05.062 --> 00:30:12.932
I had been told that the only people on the stage would be the president of the university, president of the student body, chairman of the MSC committee, and the president of the United States.

00:30:14.988 --> 00:30:22.043
And we were going to put other politicians, Republican politicians, and most of them showed up in the reserve seat section.

00:30:22.163 --> 00:30:23.266
We were going to introduce them.

00:30:23.286 --> 00:30:27.074
They were going to have the spotlight on them, get a round of applause.

00:30:27.094 --> 00:30:29.599
They all came out of the woodwork trying to get on stage.

00:30:30.561 --> 00:30:32.305
I mean, senators, all of them did.

00:30:33.770 --> 00:30:53.230

00:30:54.273 --> 00:30:55.696
And she said, she hung up.

00:30:56.397 --> 00:30:59.142
A few minutes later, about a minute and a half later, the phone rang.

00:30:59.744 --> 00:31:01.046
Miss Bowers, this is Rick Perry.

00:31:02.289 --> 00:31:03.852
And I went through the whole thing with them.

00:31:03.932 --> 00:31:06.096
He said, is there any way I can get on the stage?

00:31:06.116 --> 00:31:11.627
I said, Rick, there's not a way in the world you can get on the stage that I'm aware of.

00:31:12.789 --> 00:31:16.416
He said, Miss Bowers, he said, I'm going to try to go around you and get on that stage another way.

00:31:17.712 --> 00:31:19.759
And I said, thank you for telling me.

00:31:19.980 --> 00:31:23.010
I said, you're the only one that's had the courage to tell me.

00:31:23.632 --> 00:31:29.292
And I feel sure that Senator Graham is and so-and-so is and so-and-so is, but at least you've...
