WEBVTT

00:03.372 --> 00:10.285
And I'm looking what I believe is east into a beautiful, quiet, and I'm sure cool, backyard.

00:11.106 --> 00:16.235
Getting ready to chat with Carolyn Adair about her experience.

00:16.295 --> 00:17.698
I don't say conversation.

00:17.718 --> 00:19.581
Her experience is here.

00:19.601 --> 00:21.745
Carolyn, check your mic and say something.

00:22.086 --> 00:22.366
Okay.

00:22.447 --> 00:22.988
Testing.

00:23.008 --> 00:24.270
One, two, three, four, five.

00:24.350 --> 00:24.891
Testing.

00:27.436 --> 00:35.346
Okay, first let's begin with your giving a brief biographical sketch of your experiences before coming to College Station.

00:35.946 --> 00:42.094
Okay, just quickly I was born and raised in Houston, went to Texas Tech University.

00:43.195 --> 00:47.040
I wanted to come to A&M because in high school I knew a bunch of Aggies.

00:47.080 --> 00:53.207
My brother was an Aggie and I knew and dated a lot of his friends and we had a good time together.

00:53.187 --> 00:57.158
But it was all male, all military then, so I couldn't come.

00:57.198 --> 01:01.550
So I went out to Tech and graduated from there with a degree in education.

01:02.493 --> 01:08.850
I came home and got married the summer after I graduated to an Aggie.

01:08.830 --> 01:12.675
And the second question he asked was, would you put me through my PhD?

01:13.236 --> 01:15.879
So you can't say yes and then no.

01:16.019 --> 01:23.489
So we agreed that we would move to College Station and I would go to work and help him get through his PhD.

01:23.990 --> 01:25.672
First three years of marriage, it was a lot of fun.

01:26.092 --> 01:27.534
And it was a small school then.

01:28.515 --> 01:38.348
I was very fortunate to luck into a job as they were just opening the first ever university personnel office.

01:38.328 --> 02:01.956
and became eventually after a short time became the employment interviewer for all of the people who wanted to come to work in all the job vacancies on campus to match the the two and and that was a lot of fun learned a lot about university and how it runs and frankly it was very fascinating that to to be in the middle of this city within a within a town really

02:01.936 --> 02:05.262
I think then we had about maybe 12,000 students.

02:05.322 --> 02:06.304
It was quite small.

02:06.484 --> 02:07.145
This was when?

02:07.185 --> 02:08.928
This was in 1962.

02:10.631 --> 02:13.236
And your husband was coming as a graduate student?

02:13.256 --> 02:14.498
As a graduate student, Ph.D.

02:14.538 --> 02:15.039
in physics.

02:15.901 --> 02:16.822
Did he have his master's?

02:17.023 --> 02:22.312
Yes, master's from Rice and had been out working for a couple of years and decided he wanted to go back.

02:22.833 --> 02:24.636
And where did y'all find a place to live?

02:25.628 --> 02:29.553
We lived right off of Northgate, which was about the only possibility.

02:30.674 --> 02:32.116
Small apartments.

02:32.136 --> 02:35.860
It was really nice because it like was a bedroom and a half, so he had a little study room.

02:36.541 --> 02:40.326
And it was on First Street, 507B, First Street.

02:40.466 --> 02:42.048
I guess you never forget those numbers.

02:43.229 --> 02:47.755
Played $55 a month for our rent.

02:48.376 --> 03:01.491
And it was a little fourplex and all the doors opened into a central yard so we had a little community of other students and graduate students that became good friends and we still know most of them along the way.

03:01.758 --> 03:05.227
So it was a very pleasant way to pass the three years.

03:05.407 --> 03:08.796
I enjoyed my job very much, became fascinated with the university.

03:09.718 --> 03:18.501
Then we were fortunate enough, Tom applied for a post-doc fellowship, National Science Foundation, and we went and lived in Europe for a year in Holland.

03:18.481 --> 03:24.448
And he did some work at the Komerling Ones Research Laboratory in Leiden, Holland.

03:25.290 --> 03:31.557
And that kind of sparked our interest in international travel and European history and languages and everything else.

03:32.298 --> 03:41.670
At that time, we had no idea, but his professor, Charles Squire, was then head of the physics department.

03:41.650 --> 03:53.576
And he invited Tom to come back for one year to be a visiting professor, and we thought that was a great opportunity to put down some, well, it was a great opportunity to look for a job from here.

03:53.616 --> 03:55.500
Had no idea we would ever be staying.

03:55.520 --> 03:56.703
To come back for one year?

03:56.723 --> 03:57.605
For one year, yes.

03:57.625 --> 03:58.487
That year lasted a while.

03:58.507 --> 04:00.992
That year lasted quite a few years.

04:00.972 --> 04:03.354
Had he worked with Dr. Squire at Rice?

04:03.374 --> 04:13.383
Yes, he worked with him at Rice, and then when Squire came here, they worked together on his PhD here, so it was just a nice set of kind of interesting circumstances.

04:13.583 --> 04:21.671
So you arrive at the time the great discussions about co-education and so forth are underway.

04:21.751 --> 04:30.979
Well, actually, I arrived after those discussions took place and after the legislature decided that it would go co-ed, because when I was at Tech,

04:30.959 --> 04:33.822
the legislature was working on that.

04:34.143 --> 04:52.643
And when I arrived, a woman could go to school at A&M if they were the daughter of a faculty member, if they were the daughter of a staff member, if they had just taken their first woman in vet school, I believe, or if you were an employee.

04:53.183 --> 04:59.430
So I had kind of two out of three of those, because I was a staff member and I was the wife of a student.

04:59.450 --> 05:00.932
I think that was one too.

05:00.912 --> 05:22.752
And I actually took a class while I was working in personnel, and I didn't enjoy it because I was so busy at work and tired at five and then have to go to class and study, and so I decided that wasn't a good way to... What do you remember in general about the local attitude about the admission of women?

05:23.322 --> 05:25.647
Well, it wasn't a problem for me.

05:25.667 --> 05:39.559
I never had anyone slam a door in my face or never experienced any of the things that I heard other women experience, never, throughout my whole time of going to school, which after that was quite a long time.

05:39.944 --> 05:50.874
So when you signed up for that first class or any others, you don't recall any faculty member or someone mumbling about women?

05:50.894 --> 05:51.916
No, never.

05:52.217 --> 05:53.180
Not in front of me anyway.

05:53.260 --> 05:55.827
They were very kind about it.

05:57.055 --> 06:01.903
In working in personnel, I got to know so many people on campus.

06:01.943 --> 06:06.269
I knew all the department heads and all the deans and everybody that ever hired anyone.

06:06.369 --> 06:17.687
And so that really gave me, I think, a sense of confidence about knowing how the organization, how the university was organized and feeling comfortable with all ranks of faculty and staff.

06:19.129 --> 06:24.177
So walking to class and dealing with a faculty member was just not a problem.

06:25.186 --> 06:26.328
All right.

06:27.270 --> 06:29.676
You said walking to class.

06:30.117 --> 06:32.923
How long did you all leave over in that Northgate apartment?

06:32.943 --> 06:34.005
Three years.

06:34.025 --> 06:34.266
All right.

06:34.306 --> 06:39.617
From that, I presume you walked to the campus that you didn't drive a car from

06:39.901 --> 06:40.862
No, we drove.

06:41.123 --> 06:41.924
Oh, you did?

06:41.944 --> 06:42.825
Yeah, we drove a car.

06:43.966 --> 06:54.660
We had some interesting experiences because I remember that I remember encountering Rudder's dog, the big bulldog, if you remember him.

06:55.200 --> 07:01.388
And he was covered with paint because all the outfits would get him and, you know, paint their outfit symbol on him.

07:01.488 --> 07:08.457
And I used to ask Tom to take me around the other side of the building so I could go up the stairs and not have to walk past that dog.

07:10.090 --> 07:10.971
He was a funny dog.

07:10.992 --> 07:12.755
He loved to jump in cars and ride around.

07:13.616 --> 07:15.038
Wasn't he named Ranger?

07:15.058 --> 07:16.220
Yes, Ranger.

07:16.240 --> 07:24.835
We took him for several rides because he would get out in front of your car and start walking real slowly until you stopped, and then he'd run around and bark at the door and walk in.

07:26.217 --> 07:27.640
You mentioned Mr. Rudder.

07:27.660 --> 07:30.765
Do you remember any early personal contacts with him?

07:32.753 --> 07:34.617
Not really.

07:35.639 --> 07:50.712
In fact, as a graduate student, at the beginning of my PhD, I moved from, well, I was a graduate assistant when I came, let me go back and give you a little more history, left and went to Europe, came back, and for the year that we were

07:50.692 --> 07:57.019
The year that we were going to be here, I went back to work in the personnel office and helped implement the Fair Labor Standards Act.

07:57.039 --> 07:59.382
That was new coverage of universities.

07:59.902 --> 08:08.212
Then I decided I got a, you may want to edit this out, but a man was hired to come in and take over personnel and he was terrible.

08:08.372 --> 08:14.919
He wanted to do nothing but sleep and do, you know, and so it was very frustrating for me because there was a lot to be done.

08:14.999 --> 08:17.442
So I decided to quit and go back to school.

08:17.422 --> 08:32.388
I went back and started on my master's degree, was a grad assistant in the College of Education under Dr. Hubert for about two years and then I moved over to the vice president and comptroller's office.

08:32.408 --> 08:39.480
It was called then under Dr. Calhoun, Mr. Calhoun, no excuse me, Mr. Freeman.

08:39.460 --> 08:46.186
and worked with Bill Lancaster, who was their sort of budget planning, personnel planning person.

08:46.206 --> 08:57.917
In that position, I kept a fact book for Mr. Rutter, and it was just all the interesting statistics that he might need to have at his fingertips when he wanted to make a speech or whatever.

08:58.397 --> 08:59.678
So I really never saw him.

08:59.718 --> 09:05.824
I would simply go in there when I knew he wasn't there and get the book and take it back to my office and update things.

09:05.844 --> 09:07.625
Did he use those materials?

09:07.645 --> 09:09.467
I believe he did, yeah.

09:09.447 --> 09:15.577
Let's see, you mentioned Mr. Freeman.

09:16.338 --> 09:19.824
Describe him as a personality.

09:19.844 --> 09:21.727
Oh, he was a wonderful man.

09:23.310 --> 09:29.119
He was, I really think, probably one of the foremost finance people in higher education at his time.

09:30.201 --> 09:33.987
He was very active nationally.

09:33.967 --> 10:02.218
i i really didn't get in too much of what he did but i had a great deal of respect for him and every morning i would scheme and take him a cup of coffee and we'd sit down and talk a little bit about about oh boards of regents and planning and bond issues and all that kind of higher education stuff that you really don't get in the class this is in the late 60s

10:02.198 --> 10:05.322
This would have been in, yeah, the late 60s.

10:05.362 --> 10:06.724
Well, Mr. Rudder is still president.

10:06.764 --> 10:07.545
Yes.

10:07.565 --> 10:11.049
And as far as you were aware, what were Mr. Freeman's responsibilities?

10:11.069 --> 10:13.312
He was the system finance.

10:13.332 --> 10:32.155
He was the system finance man, and I think he had a lot to do with financing just all kinds of projects around the system, investing all the university or the system funds.

10:34.750 --> 10:38.112
That's really all I could tell you that I knew about what he did.

10:38.581 --> 10:54.682
All right, and then keep... Okay, and then I was doing, all along those years, I was doing a lot of volunteer work in the MSC, and none of the assistantships that I had had up to that point were things that I wanted to do later on.

10:54.742 --> 10:58.207
I enjoyed them, but it was like I'm not a finance person, not interesting.

10:58.227 --> 11:00.229
I want to spend the money, but not work on making the money.

11:00.710 --> 11:06.057
So I asked Mr. Freeman if I could move

11:06.037 --> 11:30.930
myself and my money over to the msc because they had no assistantships over there and i'd been doing a lot of volunteer work and just loved it so i guess i didn't realize i was asking the right person and within a week an assistantship had been established over there just came about it just came about for me to go and work with wayne stark and to officially then have a position that would maybe

11:30.910 --> 11:33.714
contribute to my resume in that area.

11:33.734 --> 11:40.724
So I went to work over there and shortly after that the legislature pulled all the non-academic assistantships.

11:40.764 --> 11:51.659
I think it was a brief period in time and so that assistantship disappeared and so they just put me to work by the hour and it was agreed that I would work, they would pay me for 20 hours a week no matter what.

11:52.680 --> 11:58.268
So my paycheck was equivalent of a graduate assistantship at that time.

11:58.248 --> 12:01.593
a half-time employee, but also a graduate student?

12:02.154 --> 12:07.222
Yes, yes, but they were not necessarily related.

12:07.462 --> 12:09.686
I just happened to be a graduate student who was working half-time.

12:09.926 --> 12:12.230
All right, let's zero in on this man Wayne Stark.

12:12.370 --> 12:12.751
Okay.

12:13.572 --> 12:15.615
Make believe that I had never known him.

12:15.635 --> 12:17.017
Tell me about Wayne Stark.

12:18.039 --> 12:18.720
Well,

12:19.510 --> 12:22.496
Uh, he, he started the MSC in 1950.

12:23.037 --> 12:28.087
He was instrumental when, when all the universities were beginning to build student centers.

12:28.107 --> 12:29.570
He was in that first layer.

12:30.091 --> 12:41.434
And I think he had a real good vision of, of why a student union should, how it should, um, um,

12:42.055 --> 13:11.910
combine the faculty and the staff and the students to become a university community that how they could feed off of each other and and use expertise and the students would would be the big winners of you know experiences from people that were not other students but other had other experiences um so i think he had a wonderful vision and i think he pulled it off very very nicely at this university we were blessed with a beautiful little building uh describe him by personality oh um

13:12.886 --> 13:17.612
He was tall, very distinguished looking.

13:18.293 --> 13:24.822
He was very outgoing.

13:24.962 --> 13:27.926
He was very fatherly to all the students.

13:28.006 --> 13:42.825
I mean, he would call them in and I remember he had a big leather couch in his office and that was like a sentence that you would come in and sit on the couch and you would get a lesson in how your future could be much, much bigger than you envisioned it to be and that you needed to

13:42.805 --> 13:46.871
to enlarge that vision and he was big on travel.

13:46.971 --> 13:55.823
He really wanted students to travel and he found lots of opportunities somehow for them to get involved in programs that would take them out of the country.

13:56.023 --> 13:58.687
I understand that some of the students call that the green couch treatment.

13:58.707 --> 14:01.170
The green couch, yes, it was green leather.

14:01.310 --> 14:10.703
Not long ago I was mentioning that to some current undergraduates and some of the women misunderstood what green couch treatment meant.

14:12.843 --> 14:14.028
I can understand that.

14:15.173 --> 14:19.933
A few, including Fred McClure, told me that

14:20.757 --> 14:47.018
the green couch treatment for him was a brief a lecture about how he could give more effort than he was giving you can do better well it was all about a potential and expanding your horizons and really pushing yourself to do some things that you never really thought you would want to do how did he identify those high leadership potential students

14:47.234 --> 15:03.378
Well, they were students who gravitated towards MSc programs, and so a program like SCONA, of course, would draw, at that time would draw some of the best students in the university, and student government, student body presidents, corps commanders.

15:03.958 --> 15:12.651
They're pretty easy to identify and always have been here at A&M, but he would call them in, and if he didn't know them very well, he would say, come in, we need to know each other.

15:12.631 --> 15:20.302
And it didn't take him long to say, you know, young man, well, mostly young man in that time, you really need to do this.

15:20.322 --> 15:24.608
And he would find money to help them get to foreign countries and do some things.

15:24.648 --> 15:29.095
And he was just very fatherly and very insisting that they do some of these things.

15:29.435 --> 15:32.580
How did, as far as you know, how did he react to co-education?

15:33.556 --> 15:35.399
Very positively.

15:35.419 --> 15:38.824
I don't think there was ever a problem with him that I've ever heard of.

15:39.345 --> 15:45.895
He was really a mentor to me, and I learned a lot from him.

15:46.917 --> 15:55.851
Can you give any examples of where he ever gave you any advice, counsel?

15:56.067 --> 15:58.672
Oh, no, not really.

15:58.692 --> 16:00.195
I don't remember anything specific.

16:00.796 --> 16:12.658
We were so, the program was growing so much and he had so little help when I entered the scene that it was like, thank God for help, you know, and just go do whatever you think you need to do.

16:12.638 --> 16:20.147
When I went to work for him, it was very difficult to get a position in the MSC for someone to work into.

16:20.648 --> 16:29.378
So, but if you had a half-time job paid by the hour, or if you had someone, an hourly person, it was easy to get them turned into a full-time person.

16:29.859 --> 16:38.950
So after about a year of working, being paid 20 hours and working at least 80, because it's not a job you can let go at, you know, at the end of four hours a day,

16:38.930 --> 16:41.594
I went in and I said, Wayne, this is ridiculous.

16:41.614 --> 16:43.056
You know, I'm working eight hours a week.

16:43.196 --> 16:45.059
Let's at least pay me for 40 hours a week.

16:45.580 --> 16:57.296
So then he went to Hannigan, who was the dean of students then, and asked Hannigan to pass through or to approve the requisitioning of a full-time position as a program advisor.

16:57.977 --> 16:59.560
So we did that.

16:59.700 --> 17:06.169
And because he went to bat for me, I have every reason to think that he really liked what I was doing and respected my work.

17:06.149 --> 17:17.048
If Mr. Stark had ever had to rank the activities of the MSC in his preferential order, which would have been at the top?

17:17.469 --> 17:18.252
Which ones?

17:18.434 --> 17:20.737
Oh, I think Scona was number one.

17:21.878 --> 17:28.306
I think probably town hall and political forum probably ranked second.

17:29.207 --> 17:41.623
He was always real anxious to do the big name things, the things that brought important people in, not necessarily concert people, but the politicians and people in high places in government because he thought that was, it was,

17:41.603 --> 17:44.791
good exposure for our students to know those.

17:44.811 --> 17:57.823
And in the scheduling of these things, he always tried to make time for students to be there during the lunches or to drive them around or to sign the letters and always do all the planning rather than just be a spectator.

17:57.803 --> 18:02.790
So I think those three and Great Issues was another one.

18:03.090 --> 18:08.417
And really those were like the four, three or four top committees when I went to work there.

18:08.497 --> 18:10.099
But we did have a travel committee.

18:10.600 --> 18:12.482
We had an arts committee.

18:12.963 --> 18:20.012
We had a committee that did what was called Host and Fashion at that time.

18:20.653 --> 18:23.757
And there was a movie committee, cinema committee.

18:24.318 --> 18:27.642
And so there were a lot of other smaller committees that needed a lot of help.

18:27.706 --> 18:37.285
Now, surely you must remember some anecdotes about when something went wrong, when something just didn't turn out the way it was supposed to.

18:37.345 --> 18:39.469
Don't you remember some snafus?

18:40.211 --> 18:43.858
Well, there were always snafus, and

18:43.838 --> 18:51.347
Some of it occurred because he was, he really let the students have their hand in doing things.

18:51.367 --> 18:56.694
It wasn't like staff programming with students helping, it was student led with staff watching.

18:57.374 --> 19:11.972
And so most of the snapus were little things that people, that the students just hadn't thought about, like a projector blowing out and not having an extra bulb in your pocket, like putting publicity out way too early and then it,

19:11.952 --> 19:13.576
it came down or got torn down.

19:14.037 --> 19:20.212
Or one of the problems was that sometimes the posters were way too clever, and people liked them and tore them down.

19:20.573 --> 19:24.843
So we learned to slash them with a razor blade and then just leave them up there.

19:24.863 --> 19:28.392
And when people tried to take them down, they kind of fell apart, so they left them alone.

19:28.372 --> 19:30.335
Little things like that.

19:30.435 --> 19:41.470
He was really big about taking students to conferences, national conferences, and having them in on the planning of the program like, well, while I was there, OPA started up.

19:41.490 --> 19:48.960
And so he was real big on going to New York and some of the big showcase conferences and taking students.

19:49.001 --> 19:51.083
We probably had more students there than any other school.

19:51.604 --> 19:57.332
And they were in the decision-making seats about

19:57.312 --> 20:17.008
who would come and the financing of all this and how we were going to how many tickets we had to sell and was it worthwhile and so the things that I remember going wrong were just little things and every once in a while we would have a program that would not be attended the way we felt it should and wouldn't make ends meet but back then

20:16.988 --> 20:19.751
The MSC was like one big thing.

20:19.771 --> 20:27.801
So if you had a failure in programming, you had maybe a little profit from the snack bar or from the bowling alley.

20:27.821 --> 20:37.073
Or if you had a failure in the snack bar and you made money somewhere else, you know, so all of that could sort of come as an effort to finance this whole thing.

20:37.053 --> 20:44.242
And after so many years, because somebody saw that as not a good management thing, it began to be split apart.

20:44.262 --> 20:57.880
And so eventually, he was left with only the programming and the Student Finance Center, which was the operation of student organizations, and the Student Programs Office.

20:57.860 --> 21:05.486
Who are some of the greatest, in terms of their fame, the greatest people that were here?

21:05.506 --> 21:06.227
People that came here?

21:06.527 --> 21:07.949
Well, of course, I remember Bob Hope.

21:08.329 --> 21:08.749
He came.

21:09.510 --> 21:11.111
He did a great concert.

21:12.332 --> 21:23.682
Towards the end of Wayne's, maybe even after he left, it was George Strait.

21:23.702 --> 21:27.445
And I was there, and the student, the black community, so I couldn't do anything.

22:33.355 --> 22:34.696
Oh, and the light comes on.

22:34.716 --> 22:35.597
That's good.

22:37.339 --> 22:38.420
Make sure I'm on over here.

22:38.600 --> 22:39.020
I think I am.

22:39.040 --> 22:42.383
We were interrupted by... Technical failure.

22:42.423 --> 22:48.609
Technical failure because the professional who put the batteries in put one in wrong.

22:51.912 --> 22:57.156
So, Dean Hannigan retires soon after Jack Williams came.

22:58.678 --> 23:01.280
First, what was your impression of Jack Williams?

23:02.221 --> 23:03.362
Okay.

23:04.928 --> 23:10.239
A scholar, not a retired general, but a scholar.

23:11.882 --> 23:15.469
Very bright, lots of appeal to the faculty.

23:16.391 --> 23:19.377
Nice guy, easy going, very likable.

23:21.321 --> 23:22.443
Students really liked him.

23:23.064 --> 23:24.507
What did the students like about him?

23:24.807 --> 23:30.518
I think that he was so direct and easygoing and he was willing to be there if they needed him.

23:32.181 --> 23:39.094
His forte was not students, but he did a good job of making them think that it was, I thought.

23:39.895 --> 23:40.977
What about those notes?

23:41.362 --> 23:42.664
Well, the notes were wonderful.

23:42.724 --> 23:51.576
The little short thank you notes, personal thank you notes, thanking you for something that you didn't even know you did sometime.

23:52.818 --> 23:59.707
They were such a morale builder to think that the president of the university would notice something like that.

23:59.727 --> 24:01.409
He was a master at short notes.

24:01.589 --> 24:03.973
One-liners just did a great job.

24:04.253 --> 24:10.862
And I think he made a lot of people feel like what they were doing was important.

24:11.281 --> 24:26.691
For both Mr. Rudder and Dr. Williams, do you remember any personal foibles, things they really didn't like or things they really did like, pet peeves, pet likes?

24:30.232 --> 24:34.980
No, I don't think I was close enough to either one of them to know some of those.

24:35.020 --> 24:40.208
Perhaps if I'd worked in their office or somebody like Nelda probably has a whole long list of them.

24:40.228 --> 24:43.013
Yeah, I got to work on Nelda to see if she'll do an interview.

24:43.033 --> 24:46.418
Oh, surely she will.

24:48.507 --> 24:56.237
General Hannigan retires, and there's a search for a new... Search for a newly elevated position.

24:56.317 --> 25:10.474
I think that Williams realized that we were coming into this enrollment, lots more needed to be done for students, for the non-military side of students, and he needed a person to take off and do all of that for him.

25:12.217 --> 25:15.200
Am I correct that we named it at first Student Services?

25:15.280 --> 25:18.244
Yes, it was Student Services, as long as John Colvis was here.

25:18.224 --> 25:27.039
which was 20-ish years, and only when Malin came in did he decide to change the name, and I'm not sure why he did that.

25:27.059 --> 25:34.291
There were some comments that came from the president's provost area that we were probably the only school that called it student services.

25:35.032 --> 25:38.798
Now, we faculty members heard a

25:38.778 --> 25:50.683
Rumor, probably not factual, that some board member had said, since our students didn't have affairs, that we weren't going to have a vice president for student affairs.

25:50.703 --> 25:51.665
I never heard that.

25:53.870 --> 25:55.012
We said that a lot.

25:55.032 --> 25:56.736
We said that a lot.

25:56.902 --> 26:01.329
Right now, you said that your husband, Tom, was on the screening committee.

26:01.829 --> 26:11.183
Do you remember his... I don't know that he was on the screening committee, but he was assistant to the president at that time, and so he was privy to the search information.

26:11.224 --> 26:17.072
Do you remember any of his first impressions of this new man, John Colvis?

26:18.094 --> 26:21.759
Just that he was an incredibly warm, friendly, nice person.

26:22.100 --> 26:22.200
Okay.

26:22.383 --> 26:25.311
Now, when do you go over full-time?

26:25.331 --> 26:37.303
Okay, I was working in the MSC full-time at this point, and I had, I think I was making $8,800 a year, which was fine with me, 12 months.

26:37.705 --> 26:42.595
John Coldest came and I heard news that there was a new vice president.

26:42.635 --> 26:46.422
I don't think I had ever seen him or met him or anything.

26:46.763 --> 26:51.953
And one day he walked into my office, in the student program's office.

26:52.013 --> 26:54.559
He walked into my office and he shut the door.

26:54.659 --> 26:56.322
My door was never shut.

26:56.302 --> 27:08.203
He shut the door and I had met him, I guess, and he said, you know who I am and that I am planning out a new division of student services.

27:08.243 --> 27:12.351
There's a lot that needs to be done for students and to be done in the future.

27:12.912 --> 27:16.538
And he had this organization chart and he rolled it out on my desk.

27:17.598 --> 27:27.383
And he went through the different, you know, people and positions, directors of this, directors of that, and there was this empty box, and it was called Director of Student Activities.

27:27.403 --> 27:30.190
And he said, I have added this position,

27:30.980 --> 27:35.346
And I wanted to do several things.

27:35.767 --> 27:40.473
I want someone to take care of all the student organizations that are not MSC committees.

27:41.014 --> 27:45.540
I want someone to publish some important things that we need for the division.

27:46.281 --> 27:49.366
I want to start some leadership programs.

27:49.386 --> 27:51.889
I think those were the three that he laid out.

27:52.510 --> 27:56.716
And he said, I would really like for you to consider taking this position.

27:56.736 --> 27:57.798
I almost fell out.

27:58.018 --> 28:00.902
I was absolutely shocked.

28:00.882 --> 28:21.220
and so he said I know you're leaving on a vacation tomorrow and when you come back you can give me your response and also I want you to tell me what you think you should be paid I was clueless and as I said I was totally happy with my $8,800 a year so I went off on vacation and of course it ruined my vacation

28:21.200 --> 28:26.629
Because I thought and thought and I thought, you know, do you really want to leave a job that you love and you're happy in to do this other stuff?

28:27.310 --> 28:32.579
So I came back and I said, well, you actually, you made me an offer I can't refuse.

28:32.600 --> 28:34.964
There are a lot of things that I think need to be done that I'd like to do.

28:35.885 --> 28:39.151
And I think you should pay me $18,000 a year.

28:40.313 --> 28:42.837
And he said, great.

28:43.424 --> 28:46.750
17-5 is the number I had in mind.

28:47.531 --> 28:54.704
And he said, after you do the things that I need you to do, you can do whatever else you think is important.

28:55.405 --> 29:01.416
But, he said, during the next year or so, you will get your PhD.

29:02.307 --> 29:08.500
And I said, I didn't say it, but that was exactly the footprint that I needed in my rear end to get me going again.

29:09.202 --> 29:10.705
So I said, okay.

29:10.725 --> 29:11.928
I said, when does all this happen?

29:12.028 --> 29:12.749
September 1.

29:13.210 --> 29:16.317
What year is this?

29:18.490 --> 29:20.993
I want to say, I can never remember this year.

29:21.033 --> 29:22.114
I want to say it was 73 or 74.

29:22.174 --> 29:24.477
That would be my guess.

29:24.497 --> 29:25.298
Something in there.

29:25.338 --> 29:28.481
You can find out when his position was effective.

29:28.501 --> 29:29.483
And it was the following.

29:29.863 --> 29:35.309
I mean, he came and he laid all this out, studied it a year, and then he put it, he implemented it.

29:35.710 --> 29:39.454
And I think I was the last person to, the last box to fill.

29:39.955 --> 29:43.699
There were some boxes that he wanted, but they weren't in our division, which eventually came in.

29:43.759 --> 29:45.701
Student financial aid eventually came in.

29:46.662 --> 29:47.383
And...

29:47.971 --> 29:49.795
I don't know what else I'll probably think of as we go.

29:51.197 --> 29:54.003
So I'll never forget, we had our first staff meeting.

29:55.346 --> 29:55.887
Is it working?

29:56.709 --> 30:04.444
We had our first staff meeting and it was like before we all, you know, we all knew we were gonna do this.

30:04.829 --> 30:13.009
If you've ever felt a motion of the world spin, someone asked, Dr. Colvis, when is all this effective?

30:13.309 --> 30:16.497
And he said, it is effective right now.

30:16.517 --> 30:20.005
And we all just went boom, you know, we sort of fell into this new chair.

30:20.807 --> 30:22.872
And that's where it all started.

30:22.852 --> 30:28.103
Now who, you reported, your title was Director of Student Activities.

30:28.123 --> 30:28.403
Yes.

30:28.744 --> 30:30.989
You reported to Vice President Colvis.

30:31.009 --> 30:32.191
Directly to Colvis.

30:32.211 --> 30:36.841
Who were the other key people that reported to him at the time?

30:36.861 --> 30:39.426
Okay, Wayne Stark reported to him as Director of MSC.

30:39.794 --> 30:45.522
Charlie Powell reported to him as like the dean of students, more or less.

30:45.622 --> 30:48.867
He had housing and he had discipline.

30:49.528 --> 30:52.553
The commandant reported to him, I believe, at that time.

30:56.598 --> 31:04.570
Toby Reeves was the dean of women, and she reported to him, or actually,

31:04.820 --> 31:16.235
Yeah, I'm not sure she reported through Charlie to him, and Ron Blatchley was like, Dean of Men reported through, but they were, the three of them were there at that meeting, I remember that.

31:16.696 --> 31:22.744
The director of the health center was there, and the director of counseling came on board.

31:23.945 --> 31:30.574
Director of the health center was, it was before Claude Goswick, because I think he was hired a little later, but maybe not.

31:31.027 --> 31:33.531
Was Austin Curley the counseling center?

31:33.671 --> 31:36.335
I think Austin, no, he was not counseling center.

31:36.736 --> 31:43.305
He hired Wade right away to come down and do counseling center from East Texas.

31:43.325 --> 31:44.547
I believe Wade was at East Texas.

31:46.490 --> 31:47.291
Let me think what else.

31:47.672 --> 31:48.974
We didn't have financial aid.

31:49.815 --> 31:51.077
We didn't have...
