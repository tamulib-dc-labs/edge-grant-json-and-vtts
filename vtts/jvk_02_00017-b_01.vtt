WEBVTT

00:00:04.469 --> 00:00:07.092
You said it may have been a place for them to get away from here.

00:00:07.293 --> 00:00:12.680
From whatever they needed to get away from, whether it was dorms or apartments.

00:00:13.180 --> 00:00:24.515
And I just noticed in the catalog, it doesn't look like they have a tremendous amount of dorm space here for the size of the university.

00:00:24.575 --> 00:00:27.118
So a lot of people have to live off campus.

00:00:27.689 --> 00:00:32.857
That is never going to change now because it is too big an operation.

00:00:32.897 --> 00:00:37.545
They couldn't possibly have enough dorms to take care of this group.

00:00:38.346 --> 00:00:49.744
In all of your years working here, did any co-ed ever come to you and ask you for some specific help that only a woman might ask for?

00:00:49.804 --> 00:00:53.730
One time there was a beautiful girl

00:00:55.398 --> 00:01:18.638
who came in to me and she was crying and I didn't you know and I took her into to the ladies room restroom and she was crying and crying and she had been she obviously had been bruised and battered and I said well I would like to call the authorities and oh no no no she didn't want that done

00:01:19.073 --> 00:01:23.798
And I think, looking back, no, I would have certainly insisted that she do that.

00:01:24.279 --> 00:01:26.301
But she was pleading me not to.

00:01:27.102 --> 00:01:30.085
But she was really in terrible shape when she got over here.

00:01:30.746 --> 00:01:33.890
Her face and her arms, oh, she was badly bruised.

00:01:34.791 --> 00:01:47.545
And I just don't think that kind of thing probably, somebody who had perpetrated that would have been probably out right now.

00:01:48.098 --> 00:01:50.001
And so it's hard to say.

00:01:50.041 --> 00:01:59.496
All of that, that whole concept of abuse, that was buried for a very long time.

00:02:00.278 --> 00:02:00.939
It really was.

00:02:02.702 --> 00:02:05.366
But now, I mean, this is part of it.

00:02:05.446 --> 00:02:08.571
This is part of the culture.

00:02:09.175 --> 00:02:18.689
You have to be careful now that you don't go overboard and somebody is making up some of this stuff on the other side of that.

00:02:18.990 --> 00:02:20.972
And I can see how this would happen, too.

00:02:21.854 --> 00:02:23.496
This is a very sticky business.

00:02:23.556 --> 00:02:28.804
And of course, lawyers are kept in big business doing this harassment detail.

00:02:29.155 --> 00:02:36.728
Did you ever see a couple of students doing a little too much embracing?

00:02:36.908 --> 00:02:42.116
I actually didn't, right down in the reference where I was.

00:02:42.237 --> 00:02:48.727
But I'm sure it went on big time here, because as I said before, we did have all these nooks and crannies, too.

00:02:49.649 --> 00:02:50.370
Noise?

00:02:51.042 --> 00:02:55.074
Noise, in a university library, you have to expect noise.

00:02:55.174 --> 00:03:02.335
Now, to this day, when I go into the public libraries, either the Bryan or College Station, not so much the College Station one, but the Bryan one,

00:03:02.956 --> 00:03:06.321
You always have the feeling that you shouldn't be talking loud.

00:03:06.382 --> 00:03:07.784
But I always talk loud.

00:03:07.884 --> 00:03:11.189
I mean, I always talked in my normal speaking voice here.

00:03:11.490 --> 00:03:12.111
You have to.

00:03:14.815 --> 00:03:22.307
Maybe a library is a quiet place to study, but that's, I think, probably more a thing of the past.

00:03:23.509 --> 00:03:27.035
But particularly, as I say, not for a university library.

00:03:27.175 --> 00:03:30.280
University libraries are very, very busy places.

00:03:31.137 --> 00:03:44.129
The, back to chronology, Dr. Hoadley came in the early 70s, and the library had been expanded, but not as large as it is now.

00:03:45.431 --> 00:03:50.876
Did you all think that we were making progress, that the library was moving forward in the 70s?

00:03:51.877 --> 00:03:52.858
Well, we had to.

00:03:53.158 --> 00:04:00.705
We didn't have a choice, but the enrollment was expanding dramatically.

00:04:00.803 --> 00:04:10.236
And since we had taken women in, I think the ratio is still more men than there are women here.

00:04:10.256 --> 00:04:12.739
53-47.

00:04:12.899 --> 00:04:13.901
Is that what it is?

00:04:14.381 --> 00:04:17.726
Well, that's not as much as I thought it was.

00:04:18.747 --> 00:04:21.711
But anyway, we had to.

00:04:22.092 --> 00:04:25.917
There was no way to have gone except

00:04:26.605 --> 00:04:28.587
expand as we are expanding.

00:04:28.648 --> 00:04:35.777
And I, from the sound of things, you're not through expanding with this plan, what is it, your 20?

00:04:35.937 --> 00:04:36.417
Vision.

00:04:36.437 --> 00:04:37.459
Vision, yeah.

00:04:37.479 --> 00:04:47.331
Well, see they're already getting input on that from the people in the library and I'm hearing rumors about that too.

00:04:47.311 --> 00:04:50.014
You know, they'll have to expand somewhere.

00:04:50.034 --> 00:04:51.315
Of course, they did expand.

00:04:51.355 --> 00:04:55.480
There was a medical library and there was a west campus library.

00:04:55.540 --> 00:05:03.689
But that didn't come until, well, the medical library must have started in the 70s.

00:05:04.249 --> 00:05:13.099
But the west campus business and computer center didn't start until 80s, I don't believe.

00:05:13.366 --> 00:05:27.139
As you became acquainted with professionals elsewhere, other libraries, did you have the impression that the pace of our change was appropriate compared to what others were doing?

00:05:28.115 --> 00:05:28.997
Oh, I think so.

00:05:29.017 --> 00:05:30.540
I really do.

00:05:30.560 --> 00:05:35.851
We never could compare ourselves to the University of Texas, not ever.

00:05:35.891 --> 00:05:44.830
And maybe they can start doing that now, but even so, I don't think the liberal arts could ever catch up.

00:05:44.850 --> 00:05:48.638
We aren't going to have a law school here.

00:05:48.803 --> 00:05:50.465
I mean, we may be on a system.

00:05:50.946 --> 00:05:58.878
This university has a system just like UT has a system, but it's not ever going to be the same.

00:05:59.939 --> 00:06:03.324
And I think you wouldn't want it to.

00:06:03.665 --> 00:06:08.151
If you're really honest about it, you don't really want it to be the same.

00:06:08.792 --> 00:06:14.000
You want it to have its particular atmosphere that it has.

00:06:14.400 --> 00:06:15.923
It's never really lost that.

00:06:16.363 --> 00:06:17.545
It's still Aggieland.

00:06:18.048 --> 00:06:19.910
And it's always going to be A land.

00:06:20.972 --> 00:06:33.328
As you became an administrator, and before that, before you became an administrator, did you feel that you were being fairly judged and evaluated?

00:06:33.408 --> 00:06:39.195
How did you know whether you were measuring up to the expectations of your?

00:06:39.597 --> 00:06:51.509
Well, I don't, you know, I think as I started out by saying Irene Hoadley had very definite ideas about people.

00:06:52.310 --> 00:07:04.002
We all in the social science, well we all in the public services, I should expand this, all of us in the public services were sure that she was

00:07:03.982 --> 00:07:07.989
had great preference to the librarians in the technical services.

00:07:08.029 --> 00:07:09.612
And I don't think that was always true.

00:07:10.874 --> 00:07:19.028
But she had, I think Evelyn King had a very difficult time.

00:07:19.269 --> 00:07:27.323
Henry Alsmeyer had a very difficult time as in public services dealing with the director.

00:07:29.463 --> 00:07:42.506
Some, not everybody did, not everybody did, but I, you know, they were very, Evelyn King was wonderful to work for because she really was, cared about her people.

00:07:43.147 --> 00:07:48.356
Someone else that has had a controversial career is Dr. Jackson.

00:07:49.077 --> 00:07:52.483
She was, you know, if you worked for her,

00:07:53.037 --> 00:07:58.405
You know, and she demanded loyalty, and that was fine.

00:07:58.445 --> 00:08:03.614
She had wonderful organizational skills, absolutely wonderful, and she's brilliant.

00:08:03.874 --> 00:08:05.557
She's brilliant.

00:08:05.577 --> 00:08:08.201
Well, a science librarian, there's no question about it.

00:08:08.962 --> 00:08:19.939
But the day of being tough on, you know, the days of being really tough on people who aren't quite up to par

00:08:20.392 --> 00:08:27.211
I mean, you don't deal with it quite in the way that has been dealt with it in recent years.

00:08:27.251 --> 00:08:32.747
Now, I'm not talking about when I was working for her because I have great, great respect

00:08:33.048 --> 00:08:37.353
for her and her essay.

00:08:37.453 --> 00:08:41.397
I don't know anybody in the library who had better organizational skills.

00:08:41.877 --> 00:08:49.946
When we were talking about alter egos, the director told her one time that she, Kathy Jackson, was her alter ego.

00:08:52.469 --> 00:09:01.198
Irene didn't like actual confrontation, but she absorbed enough of Machiavellian theory

00:09:01.364 --> 00:09:06.112
to know how to play that game, and she did a mighty good job of it.

00:09:08.836 --> 00:09:17.370
One of our assistant directors was by the name of Noreen Aldridge, and we called her the hatchet person.

00:09:18.311 --> 00:09:22.658
I don't know if she was here, if you remember her or not.

00:09:24.982 --> 00:09:26.224
She was followed by

00:09:26.508 --> 00:09:28.731
by a very, a gal that was very good.

00:09:28.791 --> 00:09:32.836
And then after that, Dr. Jay Poole came in.

00:09:32.956 --> 00:09:33.838
He was great.

00:09:33.938 --> 00:09:34.879
He was wonderful.

00:09:34.999 --> 00:09:37.823
He had, he was the hero of the staff.

00:09:38.003 --> 00:09:43.731
One time we had, this is really one of those, one of those anecdotal stories.

00:09:44.532 --> 00:09:48.377
We'd had a power outage, can you, if you can, you can well imagine.

00:09:49.498 --> 00:09:51.621
And the director,

00:09:53.035 --> 00:09:55.397
The staff was just miserable.

00:09:55.497 --> 00:09:56.718
I mean, everything was off.

00:09:56.738 --> 00:10:02.904
It was the middle of the summer, and everything went off, all air conditioning, everything was off.

00:10:03.485 --> 00:10:08.309
And it gets pretty stuffy in this complex.

00:10:08.850 --> 00:10:20.280
Jay Poole, on his own, without asking permission, went over to Grounds Maintenance and got us fans, old-fashioned fans.

00:10:20.300 --> 00:10:22.502
We had these huge fans over here.

00:10:22.820 --> 00:10:26.925
Well, that cost one of the biggest flaps.

00:10:27.806 --> 00:10:34.355
A real shouting match we had between the assistant director and the director.

00:10:34.375 --> 00:10:39.381
Well, that is one of the memorable stories I have.

00:10:40.823 --> 00:10:43.186
What was the outcome of that?

00:10:43.847 --> 00:10:44.868
There was a draw.

00:10:45.028 --> 00:10:46.290
We still kept them.

00:10:46.330 --> 00:10:49.654
We had the fans till the power came back on.

00:10:50.022 --> 00:10:53.106
What was the reason for the opposition to the fans?

00:10:53.126 --> 00:10:54.828
Well, she didn't want to have to spend the money.

00:10:55.168 --> 00:10:55.889
Oh, oh.

00:10:55.909 --> 00:10:57.571
See, money was the big key.

00:10:58.132 --> 00:11:02.958
You know, you don't, staff comfort is not first priority.

00:11:03.419 --> 00:11:03.619
Right.

00:11:03.719 --> 00:11:14.713
As far as you people at the real working level were aware, Dr. Hoadley's first priority of expenditure was technology.

00:11:16.465 --> 00:11:19.453
And what else were high priority expenditure?

00:11:19.473 --> 00:11:29.301
Well, as I said early on, with the technology, she wanted to have that state of the art, all of the computer stuff come in here that was state of the art.

00:11:29.782 --> 00:11:30.103
Okay.

00:11:31.400 --> 00:11:43.879
It seemed from our standpoint that that, maybe this is just library politics, I don't know, but it went on for so long that we didn't think about it anymore.

00:11:43.919 --> 00:11:46.604
We just accepted it as part of the game.

00:11:47.205 --> 00:11:49.067
That's the way it was.

00:11:49.688 --> 00:11:55.197
Her preference was the technical services.

00:11:55.177 --> 00:12:17.742
public services you could just you know limp along the way we were and most of the time it seemed to me we were because we either were understaffed and or or else we were is and some some crisis and then we as we started to build as we started to really expand we were

00:12:18.228 --> 00:12:19.991
drastically out of room.

00:12:20.912 --> 00:12:23.657
Just really, we didn't have space for anything.

00:12:24.218 --> 00:12:39.562
On the, I don't know if you remember, we had on the third floor of Evans, that's this building, we had a curriculum collection at the College of Education's curriculum collection.

00:12:39.602 --> 00:12:42.767
We had textbooks, we had

00:12:44.350 --> 00:12:47.775
Well, you know, teachers, manuals of all sorts.

00:12:48.556 --> 00:12:55.965
We had to, I don't know what we were going to move, what we were planning to do, but we had to get rid of some of it.

00:12:56.086 --> 00:13:03.475
And I said, well, some of this, I think, you know, is not ephemeral.

00:13:03.495 --> 00:13:08.502
But some of this will be, some of this is outdated when we can,

00:13:08.482 --> 00:13:12.068
And we can kind of let this disappear.

00:13:12.188 --> 00:13:13.190
It's not called weeding.

00:13:13.210 --> 00:13:14.151
That's a bad word.

00:13:14.833 --> 00:13:16.195
The W word is bad.

00:13:16.255 --> 00:13:24.128
It's called deacquisitioning or some euphemism like that.

00:13:24.513 --> 00:13:38.581
But still, here again is one example of one of those times when you have to, just for space purposes, you've got to get rid of stuff because you're taking stuff in.

00:13:38.641 --> 00:13:46.437
We had mixed up with all of the curriculum collection, we had the telephone books up there on the third floor.

00:13:46.417 --> 00:13:48.784
Now, that was an interesting combination.

00:13:49.045 --> 00:13:52.896
The poor student's assistants trying to keep all of that clutter.

00:13:53.297 --> 00:13:54.320
This is unreal.

00:13:54.982 --> 00:13:59.616
So anyway, some of the so-called valuable

00:14:00.777 --> 00:14:15.075
some of the so-called valuable materials in education did disappear, and to no real detriment to anyone except a big brouhaha about it.

00:14:15.635 --> 00:14:24.186
Looking back in all of your years, can you recall some things that the A&M Library got rid of that we now wish we hadn't?

00:14:24.655 --> 00:14:26.217
No, I don't think so.

00:14:26.917 --> 00:14:32.122
Now maybe you as a faculty member, I don't really think so.

00:14:32.743 --> 00:14:33.664
I don't really think so.

00:14:34.284 --> 00:14:43.293
Now they still have, you know, like the, now I'm very much into the public libraries sales that they're having.

00:14:44.114 --> 00:14:50.941
And I know the A&M, I know this library has sales even now, according to Charles Smith.

00:14:51.681 --> 00:14:54.544
And so I know that that's still,

00:14:55.199 --> 00:15:02.170
going, but, you know, you have to get, you know, do you know Larry Ringer?

00:15:02.911 --> 00:15:06.697
Yeah, well, he is one of my very favorite people in this world.

00:15:07.318 --> 00:15:13.989
And Larry has been, is treasurer of the Friends of the Bryan College Station Public Library System.

00:15:14.810 --> 00:15:19.738
And he said the other day at a board meeting, he said, you know, we're not trying to make money.

00:15:20.512 --> 00:15:24.139
We're trying to get rid of some of these books.

00:15:24.720 --> 00:15:33.175
I wish you could see some of the books that come in to the public library because you don't, I mean, I'm just horrified.

00:15:33.375 --> 00:15:42.672
A lot of them we'll put out on the, we will put out on the free table as we call it and they're gone, you know, not just,

00:15:42.888 --> 00:15:44.532
not just hours, but minutes.

00:15:44.612 --> 00:15:48.542
There are a lot of people who just love to pick up stuff.

00:15:48.602 --> 00:15:55.179
But nowadays, there are some homeschool mothers who come and get those books.

00:15:56.342 --> 00:16:00.171
And a lot of the books that I wouldn't want anybody to use

00:16:00.877 --> 00:16:06.385
A lot of things that come in there I've had to throw away because of the condition that they're in.

00:16:06.425 --> 00:16:08.107
Now, I don't know how they work.

00:16:08.548 --> 00:16:13.815
I don't know how the deacquisitioning goes over here anymore.

00:16:14.456 --> 00:16:16.138
I'm out of that a long time ago.

00:16:16.679 --> 00:16:21.966
But anyway, you can't keep everything all the time forever.

00:16:22.267 --> 00:16:24.690
That's just one of the bottom lines.

00:16:25.351 --> 00:16:28.335
And I don't know, you know, I keep telling Bob,

00:16:28.940 --> 00:16:33.390
You know, what happens when we're gone and our children have to shovel us out?

00:16:33.811 --> 00:16:41.528
You know, it concerns me, because I've had to take care of three estates in the last few years, and it's no fun, you know.

00:16:41.548 --> 00:16:47.100
A lifetime collections, you know, and it's not easy.

00:16:47.536 --> 00:16:49.739
I'm grinning because I'm a book acquirer.

00:16:49.879 --> 00:16:50.580
I know you are.

00:16:50.620 --> 00:16:56.688
And I've also seen your basket, I've also seen your wonderful collection, your pottery collection.

00:16:57.630 --> 00:16:58.571
It's really marvelous.

00:17:00.433 --> 00:17:12.730
Do you, in all of your experience here, do you remember any opportunities we missed, something we could have acquired that we didn't, a collection or a special item or anything?

00:17:12.830 --> 00:17:14.472
Do you remember any stories of that?

00:17:14.705 --> 00:17:15.886
I don't think so.

00:17:15.906 --> 00:17:20.692
I think at a certain time there was money set aside for that, it seems to me.

00:17:20.792 --> 00:17:23.936
I had to go over to North Carolina to pick up some.

00:17:24.857 --> 00:17:27.941
I had Betty Unterberger look at some of the things that were on.

00:17:27.961 --> 00:17:30.103
I think it was mostly European history.

00:17:30.143 --> 00:17:32.847
But those book dealers are smart.

00:17:32.867 --> 00:17:38.994
They throw in all these remainders, and then you have to take that when you buy the collection.

00:17:39.054 --> 00:17:42.518
So what do you do when you get a few nice things?

00:17:42.498 --> 00:17:44.420
But you have to buy it as a package.

00:17:44.460 --> 00:17:51.067
You get a few nice things that somebody really wants, but then you have to take all this other junk.

00:17:51.188 --> 00:17:53.270
That would be the big thing.

00:17:53.650 --> 00:18:04.062
It's not like going to Sotheby's or someplace like that and just getting a pristine painting or a pristine first edition of something wonderful.

00:18:04.122 --> 00:18:05.383
It's not like that at all.

00:18:05.566 --> 00:18:12.353
Describe as much as you can the Texas A&M Friends of the Library group.

00:18:13.354 --> 00:18:15.376
The A&M Library group?

00:18:16.497 --> 00:18:24.205
I found out from Don Dial that that group, the Friends had been in existence since the 70s.

00:18:24.385 --> 00:18:25.586
He told me that the other day.

00:18:25.606 --> 00:18:27.628
I didn't realize that.

00:18:27.648 --> 00:18:32.433
I just have been joining the Friends since I've been retired.

00:18:32.513 --> 00:18:33.514
I didn't even know.

00:18:33.848 --> 00:18:36.070
They were very active in things.

00:18:37.431 --> 00:18:43.457
Before we just mention Don Don, let me tell you how impressed I am with that.

00:18:46.280 --> 00:18:54.327
Really, I was almost in tears the first time I came back and saw what Don had done over there.

00:18:54.908 --> 00:18:55.468
Over where?

00:18:55.749 --> 00:19:00.413
You know, to the Cushing building, the restoration of the Cushing building.

00:19:00.393 --> 00:19:03.380
You know, what it used to be was a student bench.

00:19:03.721 --> 00:19:05.164
Describe what it used to look like.

00:19:05.205 --> 00:19:16.191
Well, when I, well of course at first over there where we were, we were in, it was, it was still when I first came in 67.

00:19:16.171 --> 00:19:20.718
it hadn't gotten to be a student bending area.

00:19:21.760 --> 00:19:26.067
And just a noisy place to be.

00:19:26.107 --> 00:19:30.153
The molding, the lovely molding, I don't know.

00:19:30.734 --> 00:19:36.744
I think it's just a miracle that that came back to look the way it does now.

00:19:36.884 --> 00:19:42.313
I think it's just wonderful, really, really wonderful what he's done.

00:19:42.715 --> 00:19:53.065
And it took a great deal of work to get it that way, I know, and I'm sure, and I feel that he is largely responsible for getting that.

00:19:53.126 --> 00:20:01.074
I'm sure he had many friends, many of the friends were responsible for helping to restore that, and to the degree to which it was.

00:20:04.637 --> 00:20:10.343
Well, anyway, I think we had, the director, Irene Holy, wanted to paint

00:20:10.694 --> 00:20:14.421
everything, she had white enamel put on everything.

00:20:18.668 --> 00:20:20.632
Well, anyway, enough of that.

00:20:22.575 --> 00:20:31.150
Now, for my own placement, you retired when?

00:20:31.484 --> 00:20:33.227
I retired in 1994.

00:20:33.487 --> 00:20:35.410
I worked 27 years.

00:20:35.430 --> 00:20:38.295
I was planning, I was 69 when I retired.

00:20:38.775 --> 00:20:50.313
The reason I retired rather precipitously is my sister, my only sibling, developed lung cancer and she lived in San Francisco in a three story walk up in the Marina area.

00:20:50.994 --> 00:20:53.458
And I didn't think at that time that I could

00:20:53.759 --> 00:20:58.364
could just go out there and be with her, so we brought her here to live with us.

00:20:59.325 --> 00:21:02.068
And subsequently, she died in December.

00:21:02.128 --> 00:21:04.010
We brought her in the summer of 94.

00:21:04.310 --> 00:21:06.893
She died in December of 94.

00:21:07.994 --> 00:21:10.597
And I just could not work.

00:21:10.998 --> 00:21:12.900
I felt that I had to retire.

00:21:13.340 --> 00:21:17.725
Otherwise, I would have stayed on until my 70th year, which would have been the following year.

00:21:18.599 --> 00:21:23.206
But that was just one of those things that happened.

00:21:23.346 --> 00:21:28.313
I was able to get in on some of the new regime.

00:21:28.974 --> 00:21:32.299
Dr. Fred Heath has done a wonderful, wonderful job.

00:21:32.380 --> 00:21:35.765
I'm so sorry he hadn't been here earlier in the...

00:21:36.125 --> 00:21:37.287
When did he get here?

00:21:37.487 --> 00:21:43.476
I think he got, well it's only been about, let's see, I've been retired seven years.

00:21:44.080 --> 00:21:44.641
Okay.

00:21:45.322 --> 00:21:49.667
I think he came at least two years, maybe two years before that.

00:21:49.787 --> 00:21:50.649
Before you retired.

00:21:50.669 --> 00:21:51.630
Before I retired.

00:21:51.870 --> 00:21:52.551
Right.

00:21:52.571 --> 00:21:52.691
So.

00:21:52.711 --> 00:21:56.436
Dr. Hoadley retired and moved to the Hill Country.

00:21:57.377 --> 00:22:05.248
And describe as much as you recall the search process that led to Dr. Heath's selection.

00:22:06.529 --> 00:22:11.556
As a matter of fact, I,

00:22:13.291 --> 00:22:16.976
I really don't know if I was in on very much of that.

00:22:17.116 --> 00:22:18.879
I don't really remember a lot of that.

00:22:19.299 --> 00:22:28.312
But I'm sure that just like anything now, it's a very cut and dry search process and a lot goes into it.

00:22:28.392 --> 00:22:32.938
A lot of time, a lot of effort by a lot of people goes into this search process.

00:22:33.639 --> 00:22:35.502
And you have candidates visit.

00:22:36.190 --> 00:22:47.907
And I don't remember, I might have heard a presentation he gave, I vaguely remember that, but I don't remember being any part of the selection process at all.

00:22:48.047 --> 00:22:52.834
But as far as you and your colleagues were aware this was a fair and open process?

00:22:52.854 --> 00:23:00.105
Oh yes, yes, oh yes, definitely from that standpoint I think all of the staff was involved.

00:23:00.170 --> 00:23:06.079
Did everybody feel, as far as you know, that they made a good choice when they selected him?

00:23:06.860 --> 00:23:08.463
Yes, I think so.

00:23:08.643 --> 00:23:11.587
What were the positive first impressions?

00:23:12.028 --> 00:23:15.333
Well, he was extremely well prepared, for one thing.

00:23:15.974 --> 00:23:21.382
And he, you know, he didn't... Well prepared?

00:23:21.783 --> 00:23:24.507
Well prepared with his presentation.

00:23:25.482 --> 00:23:36.216
And he gave an online kind of a demonstration, which was very well received by the staff.

00:23:36.516 --> 00:23:43.004
And he'd done his homework, you know, to know what was here, to the strengths, the weaknesses.

00:23:43.084 --> 00:23:44.466
He'd done his homework.

00:23:44.486 --> 00:23:49.853
Now, were you all aware that he had been a faculty member and a librarian?

00:23:50.963 --> 00:23:53.167
I probably was, yeah.

00:23:54.209 --> 00:24:01.142
From the way he came in here to begin with, I felt that he was.

00:24:01.162 --> 00:24:05.530
Did he seem sensitive to this institution?

00:24:06.016 --> 00:24:08.199
I would say yes.

00:24:08.500 --> 00:24:09.741
I would say yes.

00:24:10.523 --> 00:24:20.738
And I mean, he was again more of a people, in quote, people person than some administrators.

00:24:20.818 --> 00:24:28.429
So we felt that, and as I say, I wasn't here very long when he was here and he had a lot

00:24:28.747 --> 00:24:36.620
on his plate with all of this moving into the annex and all of that.

00:24:36.660 --> 00:24:40.446
That was a big, big job.

00:24:41.688 --> 00:24:43.571
Did he bring anyone with him?

00:24:44.192 --> 00:24:45.153
Not that I know of.

00:24:45.895 --> 00:24:49.420
So were there any sudden changes when he arrived?

00:24:49.440 --> 00:24:50.682
No, I don't think so.

00:24:50.963 --> 00:24:51.784
I don't think so.

00:24:51.983 --> 00:24:54.167
But you're giving the impression there was a positive?

00:24:54.508 --> 00:24:55.951
Oh, everybody, yeah.

00:24:55.971 --> 00:25:01.341
I think he was for sure the choice of the staff, the librarians.

00:25:01.742 --> 00:25:03.966
Did you all get any impression of what his goals were?

00:25:06.251 --> 00:25:11.140
All I could really feel that he, I think,

00:25:11.660 --> 00:25:22.755
I think his mission must have been to do this tremendous reorganization that we were going through at that particular time.

00:25:23.176 --> 00:25:26.440
But as I said early on, this place has always been reorganizing.

00:25:26.480 --> 00:25:27.561
There's nothing new there.

00:25:28.623 --> 00:25:34.150
However, logistically, this was going to be a really big task, really big.

00:25:34.991 --> 00:25:38.376
If you had been his chief consultant,

00:25:39.200 --> 00:25:42.745
What would you have advised him to have as his priorities?

00:25:44.347 --> 00:25:59.668
I think that probably every time, I think that he probably realized this, and I wouldn't have had to tell him, to give the staff genuine input.

00:25:59.969 --> 00:26:03.233
And I think he was one that really, really did that.

00:26:03.652 --> 00:26:09.983
Now, I don't know whether that's all how things have worked out.

00:26:10.043 --> 00:26:14.191
But I think he really wanted their input.

00:26:15.694 --> 00:26:18.218
And of course, not all.

00:26:18.805 --> 00:26:27.395
not with conflicting sides of the library, that probably would have, he would have conflicting versions of what was important, what was not important.

00:26:27.696 --> 00:26:28.977
I mean, that's going to be true anywhere.

00:26:30.779 --> 00:26:44.155
Anyway, I don't think that with Fred there was this feeling that if you, you know, if

00:26:44.540 --> 00:26:51.407
As I said, Irene always wanted the pot boiling, but she would never take anybody's decision, actually.

00:26:51.507 --> 00:26:55.010
I think that Dr. Heath would have taken it.

00:26:56.011 --> 00:27:00.836
If somebody had a good idea, I think he would incorporate it and give them credit for it.

00:27:00.916 --> 00:27:06.061
That's another part of that coin, give them credit for it.

00:27:06.581 --> 00:27:10.665
So when Fred Heath came, morale went up.

00:27:10.932 --> 00:27:13.035
Oh, definitely went up, yeah.

00:27:13.636 --> 00:27:22.350
And I don't mean to say that they aren't having the same nitty-gritty and the same people aren't trying to maneuver the show.

00:27:22.390 --> 00:27:28.620
But then, anyway, that's going to be, but this is true in any department or any viable organization.

00:27:29.381 --> 00:27:31.084
During the...

00:27:31.418 --> 00:27:41.873
80s and 90s, as presidents came and went, were you all aware of any difference among the presidents in their concern for the library?

00:27:43.054 --> 00:27:50.204
Well, of course, Frank Vandiver was always, you know, he was a library user, but I would expect him to be a library user.

00:27:50.304 --> 00:27:53.108
He is a scholar, a writer, a scholar.

00:27:54.550 --> 00:27:56.413
Who else was here?

00:27:58.300 --> 00:27:58.824
I don't know.

00:27:58.865 --> 00:28:02.455
I'm trying to remember

00:28:05.472 --> 00:28:11.618
I'm trying to remember some of the people who were library users.

00:28:11.638 --> 00:28:18.886
And I'm not saying that people in science, I think I've given the impression that faculty in science and technology never came over here.

00:28:18.926 --> 00:28:19.727
That's not true.

00:28:20.127 --> 00:28:20.848
That is not true.

00:28:20.908 --> 00:28:32.340
It's just that I had more experience with liberal arts and social sciences faculty than I did with the other, although I certainly have had experience with all of them.

00:28:32.320 --> 00:28:34.282
in a general reference way.

00:28:34.963 --> 00:28:43.512
And I certainly had more experience with science and technology when I moved into documents for that brief period of time.

00:28:44.513 --> 00:28:46.715
I have an anecdote.

00:28:46.775 --> 00:28:48.096
This is to the typist.

00:28:48.217 --> 00:28:49.818
Add this as an editorial note.

00:28:51.140 --> 00:28:57.366
In the late 60s, I was chairman of the library committee.

00:28:57.346 --> 00:29:13.908
And there was a big effort then to bring into the main library what were then the branch libraries for business, architecture, and chemistry.

00:29:13.928 --> 00:29:16.872
And business and architecture agreed quickly.

00:29:17.473 --> 00:29:20.096
Chemistry held out, held out, held out.

00:29:20.537 --> 00:29:21.278
No, no, no.

00:29:22.152 --> 00:29:33.309
And since that building was only one block away from the library, it did not seem to the rest of us to be a long walk from that building to the library.

00:29:34.470 --> 00:29:44.245
Finally, we had a public meeting one evening in the Cushing Library to discuss this matter.

00:29:45.743 --> 00:29:59.004
Dr. Horace Byers, a truly distinguished geoscientist from the University of Chicago, was then our vice president for academic affairs.

00:29:59.204 --> 00:30:01.889
We didn't use the provost title then.

00:30:02.530 --> 00:30:07.978
And he agreed to come and hear the debate and then offer any opinion he might have.

00:30:09.220 --> 00:30:12.966
Finally, at the critical moment in the discussion,

00:30:13.469 --> 00:30:17.608
The head of the chemistry department said something like this.

00:30:18.693 --> 00:30:22.028
Well, I had not wanted to say it this bluntly.

00:30:23.122 --> 00:30:36.048
But we scientists do not have time to waste walking from our laboratory to the library like you social science and humanities people do.

00:30:37.130 --> 00:30:44.404
At this point, Dr. Byers closed the meeting and announced that the consolidation would occur.

00:30:44.941 --> 00:30:51.911
That statement terminated the chemistry branch of the library.

00:30:51.971 --> 00:30:54.594
Okay, end of statement.

00:30:55.716 --> 00:31:02.685
Do you remember ever any celebrities, campus celebrities being shown through the library?

00:31:03.086 --> 00:31:06.190
Any notables getting a tour of the library?

00:31:06.608 --> 00:31:09.695
Oh, you mean notables like Dr. Cotton or somebody like that?

00:31:10.276 --> 00:31:11.398
Or anybody?

00:31:11.639 --> 00:31:11.799
No.

00:31:12.180 --> 00:31:14.084
I don't really, I don't think I do.

00:31:14.164 --> 00:31:15.988
Don't remember a governor or a president?

00:31:16.108 --> 00:31:18.934
I don't think a governor or president are ever going.

00:31:20.598 --> 00:31:21.580
I don't think they'd take.
