WEBVTT

00:01.212 --> 00:06.038
You remember those, but normally there's plenty. 
And I would say that the fact that they took us to

00:07.059 --> 00:28.485
church, or we went to church, and to the Young 
People's

00:07.059 --> 00:28.485
Union,

00:07.059 --> 00:28.485
kept us on a straight and narrow, I guess. And of 
course we had strong fest. We had one family, the

00:35.913 --> 00:42.039
Lairds, they had a piano. And of course one of my 
classmates, Edmund Laird, could play the piano. I

00:47.384 --> 00:48.345
mean very good. So everybody would go down there, 
all the teenagers would go down to their house and

00:48.365 --> 00:56.734
sing.

00:58.739 --> 01:02.103
Now you really, I don't know why we didn't get in 
trouble, but we never did. Let's

01:02.243 --> 01:07.010
talk about your education. You went to Reagan High 
School in 1922 to 1926.

01:13.858 --> 01:16.181
Before that time you were in Reagan Elementary 
Schools. What were your favorite subjects? Well,

01:20.727 --> 01:27.075
I didn't work real hard in school. I played 
football, and I played basketball, and I played

01:28.355 --> 01:35.283
baseball, because you had to. I had ten classmates 
in my high school, and about half of them were

01:35.423 --> 01:49.200
girls, so if you didn't play you didn't have a team. 
As far as school is concerned, I think we had we got

01:56.418 --> 02:04.749
as good an education as you can get in a small 
school. And I think we probably got a better

02:04.809 --> 02:10.817
education than you get in the bigger school, large 
consolidated schools now. Because you just got a

02:11.798 --> 02:20.410
lot of individual attention with only 11, 12, or 15 
kids in each class. Everybody took exactly the

02:21.932 --> 02:25.176
same. the things you remember are not how hard you 
studied. There's normally one teacher, Mrs.

02:30.372 --> 02:37.580
Young, when I was in the second grade while she was 
teaching me penmanship. You know you're supposed

02:37.880 --> 02:53.577
to keep your wrist flat to the top of the desk and of 
course I was having problems so she was, she was

02:37.880 --> 02:53.577
getting all her long fingernails that pinched me 
on my through my wrist and you remember those type

02:55.092 --> 02:57.696
of things. But I guess that teaches you a lesson on 
penmanship. But as far as, well of course my

03:02.924 --> 03:08.773
favorite subject was math because I didn't have to 
study. It just came natural. It just came natural

03:10.857 --> 03:21.353
that I could

03:10.857 --> 03:21.353
make a hundred on math almost without any problem, 
without even studying at all. And you really don't

03:22.902 --> 03:45.831
study very much in a rural community where you go 
home and have to pick cotton after school and on

03:22.902 --> 03:45.831
Saturdays and

03:22.902 --> 03:45.831
bale hay and do all of that activity while you 
really don't have a lot of opportunity to study.

03:46.832 --> 03:51.778
And I think the other...

03:52.045 --> 04:03.299
Well,

03:52.045 --> 04:03.299
I think that as far as English is concerned in high 
school, it wasn't stressed enough in my high

03:52.045 --> 04:03.299
school. It was not? I can remember one teacher, why 
she liked to read, so instead of making us write

04:04.741 --> 04:18.559
themes and things of this sort, why she was reading 
some American literature or English literature,

04:19.079 --> 04:22.484
And of course, at that age, well, you really don't 
pay much attention. Right,

04:22.584 --> 04:26.369
right. What do teachers think of you as a student? 
Well, probably a dreamer. What do you mean by that?

04:34.120 --> 04:42.292
Well, I mean, you're always looking out the window 
and wanting to be outside rather than inside, that

04:34.120 --> 04:42.292
type of thing. At least that's what they say.

04:46.838 --> 04:51.644
And I don't know exactly what type of grade I had in 
high school. I would say that I was making A's or

04:51.664 --> 04:58.693
100's in mathematics and physics and this type of 
thing. I was probably making in Spanish and Latin

04:58.753 --> 05:04.299
and all those. I was probably just passing.

05:08.585 --> 05:10.467
What about your popularity? Would you consider 
yourself popular in high school? Well,

05:14.547 --> 05:19.933
Stevenson, I guess everybody was popular. I don't 
know. Well, did they like you? I guess that's what I

05:21.635 --> 05:23.176
mean. Did you feel that your other student 
colleagues liked you? Well, I don't know. I don't

05:29.503 --> 05:33.908
think you ever get impressed as to whether or not 
they like you or not. I had Debbie Harlan, who was a

05:34.008 --> 05:42.057
real good friend.

05:42.239 --> 05:45.104
we really piled around together all the time. And

05:45.204 --> 05:56.585
as far as getting in fights, you very seldom get in a 
squabble with anybody or things of this sort.

05:57.607 --> 05:58.509
Okay. Now you became a leader in the military. Were 
you a in any way a leader of any groups or

06:03.485 --> 06:09.911
organizations or maybe your baseball club or 
anything when you were in high school? I mean did

06:10.352 --> 06:14.075
this leadership ability develop at this age or 
later?

06:17.779 --> 06:24.266
Well,

06:17.779 --> 06:24.266
I don't know whether how it really develops. It's 
real difficult to determine how you develop

06:24.346 --> 06:30.792
leadership or I think your Compassion is 
developed during your high school years and your

06:31.683 --> 06:39.854
work years. I think the way that your mother and dad 
handles you as far as giving you responsibilities

06:42.298 --> 07:00.964
and put you out on a cotton patch and go off and leave 
you and expect you to do your job, and you do it. I

07:02.159 --> 07:16.855
think that being a leader on a football team, I 
don't think I was in the end.

07:18.336 --> 07:28.067
So you really didn't, everybody played so

07:18.336 --> 07:28.067
I don't think it really had an effect on me. When you 
graduated from high school, At that time in your

07:30.644 --> 07:35.469
life, 17, 18 years old, did you have specific aims? 
No, really I didn't. I mean, I think I was just about

07:38.993 --> 07:43.538
like everybody else. I was a lot of boys that really 
didn't know what they wanted to do. And the only

07:49.525 --> 07:56.913
thing that I think that as far as everything along 
came to September, you were ready to go to school

07:49.525 --> 07:56.913
again. You really didn't know what you wanted to 
do. somebody from Tyler Commercial College had

08:00.952 --> 08:08.500
come around to the high schools, must have, and 
briefed you on. I was going to ask you why you went

08:08.520 --> 08:10.302
there. Well, I don't know how I got there. But I'm 
quite sure that Mr. Roberts, who was president of

08:14.067 --> 08:28.503
Tyler Commercial College, must have either come 
around to the high school or sent you literature of

08:14.067 --> 08:28.503
some sort. But anyway.

08:33.149 --> 08:37.194
I got a hold of their name someplace. Then I think I 
borrowed about $200 from the bank to pay the

08:39.437 --> 08:53.555
tuition and the board and room that was on Tyler 
Commercial College and I took off. Well why did you

08:54.276 --> 08:59.342
think that obviously a commercial college is 
going to train you to become a businessman? or

08:59.896 --> 09:02.159
something along that respect. Why did you decide 
to go into a future of business instead of farming?

09:09.469 --> 09:17.860
Well, as far as farming is concerned, it has so many 
ups and downs. I mean, your drought, one year why we

09:18.902 --> 09:27.473
would have plenty of everything, and the next year 
why even frost would destroy your plantings. To

09:33.281 --> 09:40.808
me, it was a real frustrating type of business to be 
in. And

09:40.828 --> 09:46.774
once you get into it, why, you're stuck in it. I 
mean, it's really hard to get out of it. Sure, but it

09:50.298 --> 09:57.325
also seems, from what you've been saying, that you 
had a real stable,

09:58.773 --> 10:01.316
very stable economic base in your family. Like you 
said, you were never hungry. Well, you always had,

10:05.060 --> 10:23.419
Dad had big barns, and he would have hay that he kept 
over from year to year, and your corn cribs were

10:05.060 --> 10:23.419
filled, and they would be kept over from year to 
year. And so, actually, it would kind of equalize

10:23.519 --> 10:27.683
it, but Still, I figured working on a farm is a real 
hard job. There should be some better way to make a

10:37.809 --> 10:40.813
living than that. OK. At that age of 18, when you 
decided to go to Tyler Commercial College, were

10:41.093 --> 10:52.406
there any other alternatives besides either 
becoming a farmer or becoming a businessman?

10:53.608 --> 10:57.973
Well, as far as I could see, that was the only 
alternative, as I said. Okay, what did you think of

10:58.072 --> 11:01.095
Tyler Commercial College? What were your 
impressions? Well, Tyler Commercial College was

11:03.757 --> 11:07.621
an extremely good college.

11:09.863 --> 11:22.936
I tell you, instead of taking Greg's shorthand, I 
took some of their, I mean, they had developed a

11:09.863 --> 11:22.936
shorthand, which I thought was a mistake that they 
were, I think it was called a burn shorthand. But I

11:24.197 --> 11:27.100
learned... bookkeeping there, and I learned 
typing there, and then you learned business

11:27.923 --> 11:43.286
letters, and it was a private secretarial course 
is what I really took. Not that I had any idea at that

11:43.306 --> 11:51.357
time that that was my ultimate, you know. It was the 
beginning then of what would culminate in your

11:52.740 --> 11:55.804
MBA. Yeah, probably has.

12:02.276 --> 12:07.482
The MBA is, we can talk about that probably a little 
later. Yeah, we will.

12:12.668 --> 12:13.729
And I had some time. Were you interested in these 
business courses? Oh, yeah. Did they spark your

12:15.791 --> 12:17.814
imagination? Oh, well, no, it was, well, I worked 
real, I would say I worked, probably in high

12:26.058 --> 12:35.832
school, when you're doing all of your athletic 
activities and that type of thing, you really

12:26.058 --> 12:35.832
don't study very much. And I would say I started 
studying a little bit when I was in Tyler

12:35.852 --> 12:40.779
Commercial College. Why is that? Well, you didn't 
have your outside activities. You didn't have

12:47.488 --> 12:51.453
your athletics and things of that sort. It was just 
going to school. and we were living in a rooming

12:54.813 --> 13:00.381
house and there wasn't really a lot to do there. And 
you went to church and to school and that was it.

13:08.392 --> 13:08.952
How'd you do? Well, I did pretty good. I got a job 
before I graduated from the Lawrence Groceries

13:11.596 --> 13:19.126
Company. What grocery company was that? Lawrence 
Groceries Company in Bryan, Texas. And

13:25.036 --> 13:36.347
with the proviso, if I kept the job down there, 
they'd send me a graduating certificate later on.

13:37.528 --> 13:45.476
And it must have been around two or three weeks 
before I was scheduled to graduate that I went down

13:37.528 --> 13:45.476
to Tyler, down to the law school. So Tyler let you 
out two or three weeks early to take this job, and

13:45.496 --> 13:52.123
then if you maintained the job, why then they would 
send me my certificate later. I see. Did they? Did

13:57.711 --> 13:58.973
they send you? Oh yeah. Oh yeah. Well see the 
Lawrence Grocery Company is, was a company that

14:01.096 --> 14:09.689
had hired a number of graduates from Tyler 
Commercial College before. So they had, they knew

14:09.709 --> 14:16.400
about Tyler Commercial College so they accepted 
their recommendation.

14:18.844 --> 14:19.765
And then of course

14:22.360 --> 14:33.973
after leaving Tyler Commercial College, getting 
to work at Lawrence Grocery Company, while Mr.

14:22.360 --> 14:33.973
Lawrence, John M. Lawrence, was a real fine 
individual. I'd say he is one of two individuals

14:33.993 --> 14:43.944
outside of my parents who really influenced me a 
lot. I mean, he was very considerate and

14:53.073 --> 15:22.489
paid me well as far as I was concerned at the time, 
even though it was $75 a month,

14:53.073 --> 15:22.489
and was very fair, very small organization, and he 
was very generous as far as

14:53.073 --> 15:22.489
permitting me later on to, see he suggested that I 
apply for a poem at the West Point. I mean really I

15:22.688 --> 15:32.923
got the name from him because he at one time applied 
for an appointment at West Point and couldn't get

15:22.688 --> 15:32.923
an appointment. So he was very instrumental in 
suggesting that I apply for an appointment at West

15:32.943 --> 15:42.377
Point and he got the ball rolling.

15:45.341 --> 15:51.210
This seems rather unusual that here you are in 
Bryan, Texas right next to Texas A&M. And this man

15:51.460 --> 15:58.567
is thinking that you should go to West Point 
instead of Texas A&M. Did he also suggest that you

15:59.067 --> 16:02.290
should start at Texas A&M? No. Why did you start at 
Texas A&M? Well, I

16:04.872 --> 16:16.663
worked with Lawrenceville Grocery Company for 
about 18 months. And I decided to... Well, $75 a

16:22.797 --> 16:30.727
month, I saved enough money out of that $75 to pay my 
$200 back to the bank. And then he raised my pay to

16:30.807 --> 16:35.573
$100 a month. And then I saved, in 18 months, I saved 
about $500, which is $200

16:35.593 --> 16:49.370
to pay that off and about $300 to go to school. And I 
decided, by the way, you may not even get to West

16:51.113 --> 16:52.816
Point. I mean, the idea that he suggested it, and I 
worked at it, but I decided I'd better get going. At

17:01.273 --> 17:10.913
that time, after working about a year and a half out 
of Tyler Commercial College, I decided that I was

17:01.273 --> 17:10.913
going to have to get an education of some sort. 
Why'd you decide that? Well, I don't know. You

17:14.960 --> 17:17.423
know, you don't know why you decide to. Not very 
many people back in 1926, 1927 were going to

17:17.464 --> 17:22.450
college. And Harry, here you come up with this idea 
that you have to get an education. Well, there were

17:27.477 --> 17:29.659
a lot of people at Texas A&M then. I don't know how 
many people were in the school, but

17:39.916 --> 17:46.422
I just couldn't see being an assistant bookkeeper 
and a billing clerk all your life. If I'd stayed at

17:47.864 --> 17:53.510
Lawrence Grocery Company, I'd probably owned the 
place at some time later time. But at that time, I

17:53.550 --> 17:58.875
was getting to the point where I was in a hurry, I 
guess. Would you have considered yourself

18:00.376 --> 18:02.278
ambitious? Well, I don't know. You don't think of 
yourself as being ambitious. trying to do at that

18:09.667 --> 18:12.290
time is decide what you want to do. And I think after 
working at this grocery company of unloading,

18:12.310 --> 18:38.560
well, unloading boxcars full of sugar and flour 
and counting noses and doing all the billing and

18:12.310 --> 18:38.560
being assistant bookkeeper, why it appeared to 
you that it would take you ten years or fifteen

18:39.518 --> 18:46.966
years or twenty years to ever become one of the 
salesmen.

18:49.248 --> 18:55.295
So Mr. Lawrence, when I, well he was working on 
getting me an apartment in Westbourne. What he did

18:55.575 --> 18:58.478
was really find out who had an apartment. I mean he 
was on good terms with the various

18:58.498 --> 19:08.108
representatives from the area and also the from 
Texas,

19:08.543 --> 19:14.852
and between he and W.S. Barron. Now W.S. Barron was 
at that time a representative to the Texas

19:16.114 --> 19:32.196
legislature, and he was also a Sunday school 
teacher in the College Avenue Baptist Church. Now

19:32.516 --> 19:35.901
the College Avenue Baptist Church is no longer, 
the name has And that's where I attended. So

19:38.860 --> 19:42.865
between the two of them, they gave me a lot of 
encouragement. And

19:42.945 --> 19:56.181
then to get my poem at the West Point, I used, being a 
typist, I used to write letters of

19:42.945 --> 19:56.181
recommendation. Well, Mr. Lawrence really found 
out that Tom Connolly, who was was a

20:04.113 --> 20:10.122
representative from the 11th district, which was 
my home district, had an appointment. And so then

20:12.125 --> 20:16.972
me, then I started flooding him with letters of 
recommendation. I used to walk him down the

20:17.032 --> 20:24.123
streets of Bryan, Texas and get anybody to sign a 
letter of recommendation and mail it to him. And

20:24.163 --> 20:32.415
I'd mail him probably three or four or five a week.

20:35.230 --> 20:46.188
between those two individuals and I think it was 
Mrs. Pondexter who was the editor or the owner of

20:35.230 --> 20:46.188
the Bryan newspaper. Those three individuals 
helped me out a lot. And so I applied for the

20:50.014 --> 20:59.550
Department of the West part and I wasn't very 
confident that I was going to get it being I think

21:00.830 --> 21:05.076
the first time Mr. Lawrence mentioned West Point I 
said, well where is that? I wasn't

21:05.096 --> 21:09.202
very familiar with it.

21:13.969 --> 21:24.344
So I worked on getting a part with West Point and I 
decided to quit and go to Texas A&M to work my way

21:13.969 --> 21:24.344
through school. So I had my three hundred dollars. 
So you had enough funds? Well, I really didn't have

21:28.792 --> 21:31.436
enough funds. I worked

21:31.516 --> 21:44.174
for Mr. Smith, who had a produce company, which was 
cleaning chickens. You mean you quit Lawrence and

21:44.335 --> 21:47.739
went to work for Smith? Well, it was a part-time. 
See, for him, they gave me a room and board. And I was

21:59.318 --> 22:17.499
work the garden, drive Mrs. Smith wherever she 
wanted to go, wash the cars, keep them clean, wait

21:59.318 --> 22:17.499
on her table, and then on Saturdays I cleaned 
chickens in his produce place. And I got my room and

22:19.181 --> 22:20.462
board.

22:23.266 --> 22:27.891
And I attended Texas A&M as a day student. 
Obviously you're on Bryan, but tell me some other

22:29.710 --> 22:34.937
reasons why you decided to go to Texas A&M. Well, a 
number of my friends were going there who were also

22:37.300 --> 22:47.934
day students, and a guy named Black who had a 
vehicle and I could ride back and forth with him.

22:51.699 --> 22:58.868
And you also could get in the Corps, and in fact 
almost everybody then was in the Corps. Sure. and

22:59.613 --> 23:08.927
you got paid some kind of allowance from the Army 
for being in the Corps and being in ROTC. So anyway,

23:09.128 --> 23:13.935
any way to make a dime, I was interested in it.

23:19.744 --> 23:23.089
Did the military aspect of A&M have anything to do 
with your decision? What were your thoughts as a

23:23.189 --> 23:25.873
young man on the military? Well, I was after an 
education, really, and I went to West Point

23:27.440 --> 23:32.325
because it was free education. I really wasn't 
thinking about— You hadn't thought much about the

23:32.806 --> 23:38.152
military. No, you really hadn't. You had no 
contact with the military.

23:47.402 --> 23:56.552
The only other thing, you joined the Corps because 
that was the thing to do, and also you got some kind

23:47.402 --> 23:56.552
of clothing allowance or something to do.

23:59.333 --> 24:01.555
Did you think of any other alternatives? You were a 
young man in search of an education, it seems to me.

24:05.420 --> 24:12.267
Did you ever think of going to the University of 
Texas or going to Rice or any other institution in

24:05.420 --> 24:12.267
the state? No, the only other ones that I was 
interested in attending was Naval Academy or

24:12.668 --> 24:24.401
Coast Guard Academy or any of the academies that 
paid you to go to school. And I did apply to... to all

24:27.903 --> 24:28.704
of those. You did, really? Oh, yeah. And what was 
the outcome? Well, the Naval Academy, I was

24:32.429 --> 24:39.318
approaching the age limit that I could get in 
there. See, West Point I think is twenty-two or

24:39.338 --> 24:48.270
twenty-one, and I think that Naval Academy could 
be over twenty. And then the Coast Guard Academy,

24:49.171 --> 24:55.800
why, well,

24:49.171 --> 24:55.800
I just work on that too hard, because I don't know 
why.

25:05.269 --> 25:12.800
I just got to the point where I had somebody, Tom 
Conley, who had an appointment at West Point, and I

25:05.269 --> 25:12.800
just concentrated on him. Okay. Now, tell me about 
your first impressions when you became a student

25:14.562 --> 25:20.551
at A&M. Well, you really don't remember a lot about 
it.

25:26.510 --> 25:29.574
And I thoroughly enjoyed all my courses there. Of 
course, I can't remember of having a counselor say

25:29.614 --> 25:35.641
you could only take so many subjects. I think you 
just walked in and said, I want this, this, this,

25:35.701 --> 25:38.984
and this. And somebody told you that, well, you're 
going to have to take this course because your high

25:39.065 --> 25:46.914
school didn't teach it. And therefore, you had to, 
it's a non-credit course. So you just took it. and

25:54.910 --> 26:04.162
bought your books

25:54.910 --> 26:04.162
and of course why I selected architecture I don't 
know. That's a good question. That was my next

26:05.003 --> 26:06.144
question. You were interested in mathematics and 
you had some business background and then you

26:07.726 --> 26:15.797
decided to become an architect. Any ideas on that?

26:20.797 --> 26:23.942
I'm talented in that particular field. I mean, 
just like getting in the housing business after

26:23.962 --> 26:28.008
retiring. I think that the fact that I was 
interested in architecture and

26:28.108 --> 26:44.071
layout of buildings and construction of 
buildings is what I was really, really interested

26:28.108 --> 26:44.071
in at the time. And so I really was thinking I was 
going to concentrate in the get into the larger

26:50.294 --> 26:52.797
building type of thing. And

26:54.298 --> 27:06.271
you can't remember too much about going to Texas 
A&M other than the fact that you work and you never

26:54.298 --> 27:06.271
did anything. I never saw a football game, I never 
saw a movie, you never had a date unless it was

27:14.797 --> 27:20.683
church or something in some place that didn't cost 
anything.

27:25.649 --> 27:27.671
You were just working all the time then? Yeah, well 
I got down to oh about $165 during that year and then

27:27.691 --> 27:38.623
Lawrence Closet got me, gave me a bonus of $50. See 
I'd worked for them half a year so at Christmas time

27:39.043 --> 27:43.268
they gave me gave me a bonus of $50, which, well, 
that was about a million dollars at that time.

27:50.580 --> 27:51.060
Sure, sure. Because that really helped me, that 
really got me over the hump. And then the last month

27:56.747 --> 28:13.845
that I was at Texas A&M, I had enough money to pay 
room and board, so I moved out of the Smith's house

27:56.747 --> 28:13.845
into a rooming house for the last

28:16.930 --> 28:19.212
about last 30 days.

28:23.235 --> 28:28.080
You were a day student, while most of the students 
at that time of course lived right in the dorms. Did

28:28.100 --> 28:29.761
you have any problems with that? Well, you 
probably didn't. Being a day student probably

28:33.825 --> 28:41.511
took a lot away from the, a little away from the 
hazing that you got. Sure. Because you weren't in a

28:42.452 --> 28:45.655
position that they could chase you out of the 
barracks in the middle of the night or go out and

28:46.023 --> 28:54.492
sleep in the haystacks and things of this sort. But 
you got plenty of paddling. And

28:57.415 --> 29:08.587
the fish year was, I'd say the fish year at Texas A&M 
is a lot worse than the cleave year at West Point.

29:08.787 --> 29:09.728
Oh, it was. Oh, yeah. There's no question about it. 
Because at West Point, they don't touch you,

29:11.350 --> 29:15.895
whereas at Texas A&M, they pat you and

29:16.330 --> 29:26.285
at that time hate you pretty well.

29:29.930 --> 29:32.494
What outfit in the corps were you in? I think I was in 
engineers. And I think all architectural

29:34.737 --> 29:43.570
students were in engineers and several 
engineering students and what have you. I think

29:44.545 --> 29:47.788
that's the way it was divided, as I remember. Did 
they have you in a special day student corps

29:48.609 --> 29:51.792
outfit? No, I don't think so. I don't remember 
really too much about it, but it seems to me that you

29:54.615 --> 30:12.173
always went to that particular barracks or 
whatever they

29:54.615 --> 30:12.173
call them, at that time. where the headquarters 
were, and that's where you reported in. Did you

30:15.150 --> 30:17.133
have to report in every morning? I don't remember. 
I don't think so. I think you only reported in when

30:20.938 --> 30:30.533
you had drill or some military subject that you had 
to take. You were only in the Corps for one year.

30:33.176 --> 30:35.680
What were your colleagues like?

30:38.495 --> 30:47.668
Well, real, I mean, as far as I was concerned, the 
people who were in the architecture were, I mean,

30:38.495 --> 30:47.668
they were all real fine individuals. I mean, all of 
them had the same problem as I.

30:47.688 --> 31:06.274
I would say that there's, we wrote back and forth, I 
read four or five day students from Brian, but

30:47.688 --> 31:06.274
your, the youngsters who worked on who lived on 
campus, well I don't, you don't remember a lot of,

31:07.874 --> 31:21.663
there's no carousing, no drinking, no dope, no, 
everybody that would seem to be was there for an

31:07.874 --> 31:21.663
education. And they worked, and everybody worked 
hard.
