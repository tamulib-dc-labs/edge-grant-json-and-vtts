00:03.878 --> 00:06.200
Testing, one, two, three, one, two, three.

00:06.361 --> 00:11.586
This is Wednesday the 30th, I believe.

00:11.606 --> 00:12.507
Say a sentence, please.

00:12.527 --> 00:13.808
Yes, testing.

00:18.113 --> 00:32.367
This is Wednesday, August 30th, in the fifth floor of the Harrington Tower, and I have the pleasure and honor of chatting with Dr. Dean Corrigan, former dean of education here.

00:34.034 --> 00:48.955
To introduce yourself to anyone who might hear this tape or read the transcription many years from now, describe growing up and family background and where you went to school and all that you did before coming to College Station 20 years ago.

00:49.525 --> 00:50.666
Okay.

00:51.267 --> 00:59.096
I was born in a little town of Gorham, New Hampshire, up in the White Mountains region of New Hampshire.

01:00.238 --> 01:05.224
I went to a school which had a graduating class of 24.

01:07.126 --> 01:12.272
My favorite teacher I had for three years, her name was Mary Finnegan.

01:13.554 --> 01:17.018
When she retired from Gorham High School, she went on to

01:19.040 --> 01:21.624
study at Florida State University.

01:22.966 --> 01:25.089
She got a Ph.D.

01:25.109 --> 01:27.573
in philosophy at the age of 83.

01:27.933 --> 01:40.913
I learned that she'd gotten her degree there when I got a letter in the mail from her advisor.

01:42.428 --> 01:57.450
And they had been talking about students they knew and come to find out he was my advisee at the University of Rochester when I was a faculty member there.

01:57.430 --> 02:00.995
And she was my favorite teacher.

02:01.035 --> 02:03.999
She's been a person I keep referring to when I talk.

02:04.079 --> 02:12.511
When someone says what are the characteristics of outstanding teachers, I always use Mrs. Finnegan as my example.

02:12.791 --> 02:21.784
She, unbeknownst to me, made arrangements for the president of Keene State College.

02:23.080 --> 02:27.969
to interview me on his trip through the mountains.

02:29.131 --> 02:34.742
He was, in those days, presidents of small colleges did their own recruiting.

02:35.984 --> 02:40.332
He stopped by and I had no intention of going on to college.

02:41.795 --> 02:44.380
I was from a family of 10 children.

02:44.360 --> 02:48.407
My dad had two full-time jobs.

02:48.447 --> 02:56.821
He was a chemist in a paper mill and then did jobs in the side to support the family, so there wasn't a whole lot of money.

02:57.863 --> 03:01.529
So I said to President Young, I said, I don't think I'll be able to go to college.

03:01.569 --> 03:02.390
I don't have any money.

03:03.392 --> 03:04.714
He said, don't worry about that.

03:05.605 --> 03:13.664
You can wash pots and pans in the kitchen and I'll also hire you on the weekends to do some work for me at my house.

03:14.686 --> 03:16.490
That's how I ended up going to college.

03:17.793 --> 03:23.226
Met people there at the college who helped me get a scholarship after my undergraduate years.

03:23.257 --> 03:24.599
No, where did you go as an undergrad?

03:24.619 --> 03:29.228
King State College, and it's part of the University of New Hampshire system.

03:30.811 --> 03:34.397
And I had about 600 students there in those days.

03:34.458 --> 03:44.556
Some of the professors from Columbia University who were on the faculty, who had graduated from Columbia University,

03:46.460 --> 03:54.468
helped me get a fellowship and scholarship to Columbia to go on after my undergraduate degree to get a master's.

03:56.170 --> 03:57.671
So I went to Columbia University.

03:59.933 --> 04:01.014
Then I went into service.

04:02.376 --> 04:09.122
Then I started teaching in New Jersey in an experimental school dealing with the core curriculum.

04:10.203 --> 04:13.767
Started taking courses for my doctorate at Columbia.

04:13.747 --> 04:22.437
My major advisor there was Dr. Florence Stratemeyer, who was one of the outstanding people in those days at Columbia.

04:22.477 --> 04:29.765
And I also did work in, in addition to curriculum and teaching, I did work in the Department of Educational Administration.

04:30.846 --> 04:36.312
Ended up with a dual doctorate in curriculum and teaching and in higher ed administration.

04:36.292 --> 04:59.055
was offered a position after achieving my doctorate at University of Rochester and also at the same time was being interviewed for a principalship out in California where they were hiring two new principals at the same time to open up two new high schools in San Jose.

05:00.276 --> 05:02.839
I went out there for interviews and

05:03.697 --> 05:09.024
And part of my doctorate was to prepare as a school administrator.

05:09.104 --> 05:15.033
I had been assistant principal as well as teacher in this school that I worked in in New Jersey.

05:16.475 --> 05:28.010
So I called the dean at the University of Rochester and said, Bill, I have this opportunity to go out and be interviewed for this principalship.

05:28.191 --> 05:32.877
It might be a good experience before going into higher education.

05:32.857 --> 05:36.002
if I can get this job and have some experience doing it.

05:36.043 --> 05:38.928
He said, well, don't worry about it.

05:39.088 --> 05:42.033
You go out and do the interviews.

05:43.976 --> 05:48.845
He waited 22 days for me to tell him that I had been offered the job as the principal out there.

05:49.927 --> 05:52.992
So I took the job as principal, and he said at the time,

05:52.972 --> 05:55.856
I want you to do this for me.

05:55.956 --> 05:59.881
If you ever get ready to go into higher education, you call me first.

06:01.543 --> 06:12.837
So the day I decided to leave this experimental high school, which was tied into Stanford out there because we had ended up in a kind of a battle in the community,

06:12.817 --> 06:39.465
I called him and he said, you won't believe this, but we've just been given a Ford Foundation grant to be the first university working with three other universities, Cornell, Syracuse University, and the University of Buffalo to set up an experimental program, inter-university program to prepare school administrators and teachers

06:40.289 --> 06:43.575
in a new model of kind of a fifth year M.H.

06:43.655 --> 06:45.418
Master of Arts in Teaching model.

06:46.861 --> 06:55.196
So he said, and since you've already been interviewed, why don't you come here and direct this new program?

06:56.218 --> 07:01.588
So that's how I ended up at the University of Rochester.

07:02.058 --> 07:22.709
I worked there for eight years, had a wide variety of experiences there, including serving as not only a professor on campus, but director of an urban education center in the city of Rochester after the riots in 1964.

07:24.872 --> 07:31.542
We wanted to develop collaborative programs to move programs ahead after the riots.

07:31.522 --> 07:39.818
And I was given a leave for two years to work with the superintendents on developing innovative programs.

07:40.860 --> 07:52.602
In those days, there was something called Projects to Advance Creativity in Education, funded by the NEA Title III legislation, NDEA Title III legislation.

07:53.273 --> 07:56.137
So we developed a lot of collaborative programs there.

07:57.139 --> 08:00.724
I then went back as associate dean at the University of Rochester.

08:01.946 --> 08:14.305
When the dean decided to retire, I decided I didn't want to be dean at a place where my best friend would be on the faculty and who had been the dean.

08:15.386 --> 08:19.973
I then took a leave to work with the Office of Education.

08:19.953 --> 08:37.438
And to have that kind of Washington experience, I was served as a consultant to a new bureau called the Bureau of Education Personnel Development, and served there for a year, and then went to the University of Vermont as dean.

08:37.418 --> 08:46.717
at a time when the University of Vermont was committed to developing a whole new approach to being a state university.

08:47.659 --> 08:51.647
Had a chance to hire 58 new faculty in two years.

08:52.032 --> 08:55.098
many of whom were just beginning faculty members.

08:56.381 --> 08:59.648
One of the exciting things there was we did away with departments.

09:00.330 --> 09:11.914
We merged education and social work and created a whole new organization for identifying programs, areas rather than departments.

09:12.940 --> 09:29.565
Then I went to the University of Maryland, and then from the University of Maryland here to Texas A&M, where you called me one day and said, how'd you like to come down here and take a look at

09:30.997 --> 09:45.019
Texas A&M, and as you'll recall, I asked you over the phone about this one little clause in the ad in the Chronicle that said that you were looking for an innovative dean.

09:46.301 --> 09:52.330
Someone had, I don't know if I've ever told you this story, someone had put on my desk

09:52.310 --> 10:03.717
this little ad from the Chronicle, and underlined in red was this looking for an innovative dean.

10:03.878 --> 10:09.812
And I asked you at the time if the committee had thought about this or if it was

10:09.792 --> 10:16.631
Somebody just wrote this up, and your answer was, well, why don't you come down and ask the committee?

10:18.677 --> 10:19.479
And so I did.

10:19.499 --> 10:23.430
I had no intention of leaving the University of Maryland at the time.

10:24.187 --> 10:26.411
And you said, why don't you come down?

10:26.431 --> 10:29.577
I told you I was coming to the AACTE meeting in Dallas.

10:30.479 --> 10:32.443
You said, well, why don't you bring your family along?

10:33.505 --> 10:36.611
I came here, met you, met the other people here.

10:37.593 --> 10:40.238
Got really turned on by the potential of the place.

10:40.808 --> 10:42.930
I wasn't looking to be a dean in another place.

10:42.950 --> 10:48.236
I'd already been a dean for 14 years, but this place was too hard to resist.

10:49.598 --> 10:54.023
At the same time, as you recall, you had hired several other new deans.

10:55.244 --> 10:57.827
You provided an opportunity for me to meet with them.

10:57.847 --> 11:00.450
I wanted to meet with the whole faculty.

11:00.470 --> 11:09.820
You created a situation where I could meet with the faculty, not to have them necessarily agree with what I believed, but they ought to know what they were getting.

11:10.643 --> 11:14.086
I thought that that interview process was the best I had ever seen.

11:14.126 --> 11:19.111
It saved about six months of activity.

11:19.732 --> 11:25.497
When I did finally come, we started right where we left off after that process.

11:26.258 --> 11:29.161
I found one of the most exciting faculties I'd ever met.

11:29.401 --> 11:30.502
They were all ready to go.

11:30.522 --> 11:40.532
I think Hubert, in terms of what he had done, was to look around the country, find the best people from the best institutions.

11:41.508 --> 11:45.840
Whereas a lot of the other universities, I think, had had a lot of inbreeding.

11:45.860 --> 11:49.230
This place hadn't had that.

11:49.410 --> 11:51.777
Remember Bob Schutz from Stanford?

11:52.559 --> 11:56.530
People from Chicago, Ohio State, Penn State.

11:56.510 --> 12:01.698
And my feeling was they were just like a spring coiled up.

12:01.739 --> 12:04.703
They were just ready to go if we could take the lid off.

12:06.025 --> 12:11.114
And the climate was just, couldn't resist it.

12:11.154 --> 12:14.039
So that's how I ended up here at Texas A&M.

12:16.963 --> 12:20.449
What did you learn about A&M's image in education?

12:20.549 --> 12:22.973
As you asked friends and others, you must have.

12:23.341 --> 12:24.825
done some searching on your own.

12:25.065 --> 12:33.908
I had known Hubert from participation in the American Association of Colleges for Teacher Education.

12:34.867 --> 12:39.474
And at that time I came here, I was president of AACTE that year.

12:40.635 --> 12:48.727
And from that position, I was able to get a feel for Texas A&M University.

12:49.989 --> 12:58.461
Very young at the time, he was only 16 years old when I came here, so he was the only dean prior to my coming.

12:58.441 --> 13:07.631
So, it was a place that was, you know, looking to develop.

13:07.651 --> 13:10.314
The whole institution was growing.

13:12.016 --> 13:19.825
There was opportunity to not only develop with the College of Ed, but with other colleges.

13:20.145 --> 13:23.689
John Fackler came into the College of Science at the time.

13:23.669 --> 13:29.717
Fallon was in, kind of came into liberal arts.

13:29.958 --> 13:33.182
Bill Muse was dean of the business school.

13:33.282 --> 13:38.489
Bill had done an internship, a President's Fellowship, in the Department of Education at one time.

13:39.250 --> 13:53.490
So I found all these people here who, not just on the faculty, but in other colleges, as you know, from your experience, that the colleges of education

13:53.909 --> 14:00.857
don't always have good relationships with other parts of the university, particularly liberal arts colleges.

14:01.357 --> 14:04.401
And there's always been this kind of competition.

14:04.461 --> 14:15.934
But here, I found that tremendous commitment to the College of Education, they were being equally treated with graduate assistantships, the whole notion of

14:15.914 --> 14:20.163
of working with the state as the state land-grant institution.

14:21.987 --> 14:35.998
The fact that all faculty were on 12-month appointments, just like agriculture and engineering, where many of the courses that educators take are in the summer, so you actually offer more credit hours

14:36.687 --> 14:44.860
in the summertime or in colleges of education than you do during the year sometimes because that's when teachers have their vacations and things like this.

14:44.940 --> 14:57.160
I saw this tremendous commitment to public service as a legitimate activity of the faculty in addition to the research and teaching mission.

14:57.663 --> 15:02.758
there was a real service commitment here and everybody was proud of it.

15:02.778 --> 15:10.761
And of course that fit my own view of what a professional school ought to be in order to inform practice and improve the quality of

15:11.129 --> 15:22.742
programs in the schools, not just through the training of new people, but through the training of career professionals, and found all kinds of support for that idea.

15:22.802 --> 15:26.906
And the challenges.

15:27.087 --> 15:36.597
I mean, here was a place where there was only one minority on the whole faculty of the College of Education, only two African Americans in the whole university.

15:37.488 --> 15:47.658
A college which did not have any bilingual education, English as a second language, the challenges were just unbelievable.

15:47.959 --> 16:04.035
I, being committed to helping institutions move in those directions in terms of diversity, multicultural education, I saw this as a place which had not just commitments, but

16:04.572 --> 16:07.155
a lot of areas that could be worked on.

16:07.356 --> 16:11.080
Who was that minority in his position?

16:12.222 --> 16:12.582
Jesus Garcia.

16:12.743 --> 16:23.597
The day I came for the interviews, his picture was on the front page of the newspaper demanding that the institution do more to recruit minorities.

16:24.338 --> 16:25.459
Where is he now?

16:25.479 --> 16:28.323
He's in Indiana, I think.

16:29.304 --> 16:32.368
In your conversations with the provost,

16:32.787 --> 16:37.976
then I think we called him Vice President of Academic Affairs, Mike Prescott and President Thomas Miller.

16:38.717 --> 16:40.059
What commitments did they make?

16:40.740 --> 16:54.323
Very committed to this, very committed to this university playing a major role in not just changing itself, but

16:54.303 --> 17:06.054
a college of education that was going to be producing teachers for a state where 36% of the kids were Hispanic in the classrooms and 20% African American.

17:06.274 --> 17:24.310
If you didn't have any African American faculty members, they were committed to the whole issue, not just in terms of the institution itself needing to develop in this area, but in terms of preparing professionals in education.

17:24.290 --> 17:26.032
to serve the schools.

17:26.293 --> 17:33.542
And one of the things I bounced off them was the whole idea of Texas A&M having an urban connection.

17:34.544 --> 17:41.913
And through Hubert, they had already been doing a lot with the Houston school districts when Billy Reagan was president, was superintendent there.

17:42.554 --> 17:45.318
And I found that they had a lot of input already.

17:46.019 --> 17:49.924
A lot of the faculty was serving as resources in terms of programs there.

17:51.106 --> 17:53.689
And there was a general

17:54.260 --> 18:00.189
commitment to the idea that we really needed to move on that area.

18:01.071 --> 18:02.793
I had had the same problem in Vermont.

18:03.054 --> 18:07.360
We had no minorities in Vermont, very few in the state.

18:07.621 --> 18:12.769
But I was able to attract nine African-American faculty to Vermont.

18:13.450 --> 18:22.123
And Vermont was a little bit, they were seeking, they changed the charter at the University of Vermont.

18:22.660 --> 18:28.866
And instead of saying we want to accept minorities, they say we want to seek minorities.

18:29.907 --> 18:46.343
Not for the minorities, for the sake of the minorities, but the fact is if they were going to become an institution that was worldly, that was preparing people for the world, they needed to have that popular school student and faculty population reflect this diversity.

18:47.043 --> 18:51.908
So they needed to seek minorities to be a better institution.

18:52.445 --> 18:54.789
That was actually the tack we took here.

18:55.771 --> 19:04.047
We didn't, and that's one of the great stories that's never really been told about the faculty of this college in those early days.

19:06.612 --> 19:09.137
What we did

19:10.180 --> 19:14.687
We did something that when we did it, we didn't realize it was as good an idea as it really was.

19:15.008 --> 19:16.510
You've been through that before.

19:16.550 --> 19:21.498
You do something for one reason and it turns out that it ends up being great.

19:22.079 --> 19:30.373
What we did, we looked at this as an educational question, not an affirmative action question.

19:31.575 --> 19:33.117
And at our first retreat,

19:34.632 --> 19:37.856
We took, we had papers presented, five papers.

19:38.217 --> 19:45.086
I'll never forget, Bob Schutz came in with his paper, and he said, Dean, if I'd had more time, it would have been shorter.

19:46.688 --> 19:47.549
Do you remember, Bob?

19:48.250 --> 19:56.961
And so we had five faculty talk about what they wanted the college to be five years down the road, and a major emphasis in every paper was

19:56.941 --> 20:05.874
We're hypocrites unless we do something about hiring more minorities and seeking more students.

20:07.337 --> 20:26.425
And Jesus and Glenn Johnson and Barbara Stone, you remember the two outstanding faculty who had great integrity with the rest of the faculty, and Jesus, who was our only minority, wrote a paper on why we needed to move in this direction, and the basic gist was

20:26.624 --> 20:40.118
basically that we're hypocrites unless we reflect on our faculty and in our student body the kind of representation in the classes that our students are going to teach in and that our principals are going to lead.

20:40.159 --> 20:45.584
And so we need to move on this as an educational matter to make us better.

20:46.826 --> 20:56.496
The faculty took a vote realizing that the pool of applicants who would come to A&M in a community like this, not in an urban setting,

20:57.387 --> 20:58.669
was going to be small.

20:58.889 --> 21:11.964
So they took a vote, and they voted that if it took more money to hire these minorities than they were making at their rank, they would agree that it needed to be done, which was unbelievable.

21:12.004 --> 21:13.827
This was a credit to the faculty.

21:14.007 --> 21:19.193
So then they put meat into this, the committee, not the dean's office.

21:20.000 --> 21:24.148
went around to every department and had this discussion of this concept paper.

21:26.352 --> 21:33.165
And the first paragraph of the concept paper dealt with the fact that this institution had at one time been segregated.

21:34.276 --> 21:38.928
And there were members of the faculty who remembered teaching minorities off campus.

21:40.712 --> 21:42.436
And they dealt with that.

21:42.577 --> 21:48.211
Well, the faculty, as they had these discussions, decided they didn't want to deal with the past.

21:48.672 --> 21:51.880
They only wanted to be responsible for the future.

21:52.552 --> 21:57.239
So they voted to eliminate the first paragraph, which was good because it gave them something.

21:59.463 --> 22:01.966
You know, go in with two things you want, one thing you don't.

22:02.527 --> 22:21.276
And anyway, so they came up with this concert paper, and then they put meat on it, where there would be a social concert person, which would be the person on any interview committee to assure that minorities were contacted and that they would

22:21.796 --> 22:25.020
not have any committee searches that didn't include minorities.

22:25.060 --> 22:44.881
And of course it was the faculty committees that were doing the searches, not the dean's office, which is, as you know from your experience as president and provost, that it isn't, administration can want to do this entirely, but unless the faculty who do the searches are committed, it doesn't work.

22:45.061 --> 22:47.584
So anyway, they

22:48.273 --> 22:52.900
decided that we needed to move on this, and we had a master stroke.

22:53.260 --> 22:56.345
And the person that thought of it was Dave Erlinson.

22:57.567 --> 22:58.568
Dave Erlinson.

22:58.849 --> 23:00.691
And this was what happened.

23:02.314 --> 23:13.931
He said, if you look at what's happening around the country, and you remember every institution in the country was moving in those days, and this institution had brought in Alexander Aston to look at this and what was happening around the country.

23:13.951 --> 23:15.293
And what was happening was

23:16.049 --> 23:34.018
As the institutes were hiring these new African American or Hispanic faculty, as assistant professors, they were spending so much time advising students, minorities, because there weren't that many of them, that they weren't making it through promotion and tenure.

23:35.640 --> 23:42.411
And so what we decided, the first two hires would be full professors who already had tenure.

23:43.505 --> 23:45.407
who could do a couple of things.

23:45.427 --> 23:48.391
We wouldn't have to worry about their tenure status.

23:48.991 --> 23:49.792
They wouldn't have to.

23:50.353 --> 23:54.598
They would have had enough experience to know the pool of applicants.

23:55.659 --> 23:57.101
And that was the key.

23:57.201 --> 24:06.171
If you had these 50-year-old, 60-year-old white guys on search committees, what kind of access to the pool of minorities did they have?

24:06.860 --> 24:12.328
So we hired Dave Erlandson's advisor from Queens College.

24:12.508 --> 24:13.489
Her name was Robinson.

24:15.071 --> 24:20.679
And she was outstanding, highly respected by the African American community.

24:22.221 --> 24:30.232
And what we found was that especially women African Americans had these contacts through their sororities.

24:30.393 --> 24:32.175
They had these national sororities.

24:33.742 --> 24:39.853
Now, how many white search committees would be going to these sorority meetings?

24:40.542 --> 24:58.360
So we first hired her, and then we hired Hena Hossa, who also had quite a bit of experience.

24:59.601 --> 25:05.807
And then we began to hire.

25:05.787 --> 25:09.872
25 positions in the first five years, we filled 19 of them with minorities.

25:11.053 --> 25:17.360
Within five years, we had Hispanic and African-American faculty in every department.

25:17.381 --> 25:18.642
Outstanding people, too.

25:18.822 --> 25:20.444
Now, we weren't able to keep a lot of them.

25:21.405 --> 25:35.001
What we ended up being was a place where, and a lot of the problem, you know, from having lived here, part of the problem is you get a single female African-American who's 45 years old,

25:35.943 --> 25:41.997
And there's not much place to go in this town for social life, in those days especially.

25:42.037 --> 25:47.229
But we didn't just hire minorities to teach courses in multicultural education.

25:47.289 --> 25:49.333
We hired minorities in science ed.

25:50.757 --> 25:51.859
I can remember

25:52.092 --> 26:14.995
vividly when we hired Julia Clark I got more letters from former students about they thought the institution was going to hell you know and we're not only hiring blacks but we're hiring women to teach science and I can remember one of my exit interviews with one of the

26:15.751 --> 26:25.260
Well, in fact, with Robinson, about the experience here, which was another area we needed to do a lot of work on, which was in terms of the gender area.

26:25.360 --> 26:28.964
We didn't have that many full professors who were women, remember?

26:28.984 --> 26:36.431
Because the place had been all male, and we hadn't built up the pool of people.

26:36.791 --> 26:40.414
Even in the College of Education, we didn't have any full professors who were women.

26:41.435 --> 26:44.138
So we had that issue.

26:44.742 --> 26:54.680
In fact, Robinson told me she had more problems in the Department of Education Administration here because she was a woman than she did because she was African-American.

26:55.982 --> 26:57.204
Not just in the college.

26:57.224 --> 27:02.734
I'm talking about out in the state with other superintendents.

27:02.714 --> 27:17.260
Schell, what was her name, the assistant superintendent for education in Houston, Barbara Schell, she became the first woman superintendent, actually, in the state of Texas.

27:17.401 --> 27:26.477
I mean, that was how, now today, you know, there's a lot more women in the superintendent's roles, and they come out of curriculum and teaching, not

27:26.744 --> 27:37.426
athletics, but those were all challenges, and we never did write up all of this stuff.

27:38.869 --> 27:48.027
I can remember I served on John McDermott, remember, was chairman of the, and Bruce Schaefer was chairman of the Minorities Committee, and I was on it.

27:48.007 --> 28:15.229
and we didn't say much about it because we you know I suppose at the time we could have been guilty of anti-discrimination because we were really hiring people to to provide a talent that we did not have on the faculty now we made sure the people that we hired were outstanding people I mean who could compare with anybody and and we did I mean if you follow up where they all are now

28:16.002 --> 28:22.571
you know, uh, Bri Flores is now dean at the University of New Mexico.

28:23.533 --> 28:32.686
I mean, they're all in, uh, Ruben Donato is chairman of the, uh, is head of the Department of Philosophy at University of Wisconsin.

28:33.186 --> 28:40.857
I mean, all, if you follow up these, all these people, uh, you know, Hosier is head of the department down at the University of Texas at San Antonio.

28:41.398 --> 28:44.102
So our hires were

28:44.504 --> 28:56.043
outstanding people and what we did was for the profession and for higher education and for the cause, we really did a tremendous service.

28:56.083 --> 29:03.595
Describe what it was like for you and family to get settled into this community.

29:03.615 --> 29:11.608
No problem at all because this place is so friendly, the climate anyway.

29:12.095 --> 29:13.677
You got here at what time of year?

29:13.697 --> 29:14.118
In June.

29:15.220 --> 29:28.019
The day we arrived, the day we arrived it was 106 degrees, and Jane had had, as a hobby, collected candles over the years, right?

29:28.079 --> 29:33.327
And the guy who unloaded the truck just happened to leave the box of candles outside.

29:34.522 --> 29:42.673
We had 45 pounds of melted candles by the time we get ready to move in.

29:43.694 --> 29:49.562
But, of course, everyone was so friendly, and I picked that up when I was here.

29:49.602 --> 29:58.514
Now, once I got here, I discovered an interesting thing, and it was explained to me by the president.

29:58.574 --> 30:01.137
One of the first things we did was start a development council.

30:01.808 --> 30:02.589
for the college.

30:03.430 --> 30:04.291
And it was a little different.

30:04.311 --> 30:05.773
It wasn't just to get us money.

30:05.993 --> 30:20.069
It was to connect us with former students and also to have an avenue which we could get input from key people in various areas.

30:20.469 --> 30:25.335
One of the first members of it was Dick Scopey, who was commander of the

30:26.041 --> 30:28.345
space flight there that went down.

30:28.405 --> 30:34.615
His wife was a student, doctoral student in educational psychology.

30:35.176 --> 30:36.258
Yeah, June, Scobie.

30:36.979 --> 30:45.653
And June and Dick ended up starting the math science scholar program, which helped us recruit math and science students.

30:45.693 --> 30:48.117
We were preparing more math and science students

30:48.417 --> 30:51.046
than any other university in the United States at that time.

30:52.270 --> 30:59.676
And a lot of them were funded through scholarships that Dick and Jim, and the way they went about it was really interesting.

30:59.993 --> 31:01.695
Anyway, that's all another story.

31:03.177 --> 31:06.582
But I'll tell you what happened.

31:06.742 --> 31:20.702
I was going down in the elevator with the president of Development Council one day, and I said, geez, people are really nice around here, because everybody got in the elevator to talk to you.

31:20.682 --> 31:25.952
And he said to me, yeah, Dean, down here, we're nice to you, even if we don't like you.

31:28.056 --> 31:33.767
And I said, well, that's it.

31:34.067 --> 31:36.472
One of the two is not bad, you know.

31:37.875 --> 31:39.177
And this is the thing.

31:39.518 --> 31:43.365
And it took me a little while to get used to this and the pace.
