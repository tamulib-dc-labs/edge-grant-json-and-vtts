WEBVTT

00:03.170 --> 00:07.836
We had surplus military buildings used for classrooms.

00:08.517 --> 00:09.519
And where were they located?

00:10.400 --> 00:17.710
Well, the biggest concentration was right about where the TV station is now.

00:18.071 --> 00:18.571
South of?

00:19.172 --> 00:21.836
There was a, I guess it's that same bridge.

00:21.856 --> 00:24.720
It's still across that little creek there.

00:24.740 --> 00:27.624
And there were a bunch of them there.

00:27.644 --> 00:29.346
In fact, I saw a picture in here.

00:31.790 --> 00:33.274
Yeah, right there.

00:35.541 --> 00:39.152
Shorter types of buildings we had.

00:39.513 --> 00:42.001
Was that called Hollywood or is that a different era?

00:42.663 --> 00:44.027
Somewhere I came across that.

00:44.581 --> 00:47.687
I think Hollywood was after World War I. Okay.

00:47.967 --> 00:48.468
All right.

00:48.488 --> 00:48.889
I don't know.

00:49.049 --> 00:52.496
I believe that's... I stumbled on that term somewhere and I've not been able to identify.

00:52.516 --> 00:55.421
I've heard it, but I believe that's an older period.

00:55.982 --> 00:56.223
All right.

00:56.443 --> 01:04.598
As you're going that second semester and then your second year and so forth, did you ever think about changing your major?

01:04.578 --> 01:06.440
I did change my major.

01:06.460 --> 01:06.780
From?

01:07.922 --> 01:12.146
From animal husbandry to agricultural administration.

01:13.107 --> 01:13.367
Why?

01:13.908 --> 01:16.291
What were the factors that led you to?

01:16.471 --> 01:25.360
Oh, I thought I needed a broader base, more business economics than in the animal husbandry area.

01:25.621 --> 01:27.863
Did anybody give you any counsel, advice?

01:28.544 --> 01:29.725
No.

01:29.705 --> 01:32.269
How difficult was it to change?

01:32.990 --> 01:33.391
It wasn't.

01:33.991 --> 01:36.475
Didn't lose any credits.

01:37.437 --> 01:49.755
Were there any courses that you heard about early in your years here that were supposed to be the tough, tough courses?

01:55.456 --> 01:57.739
I don't remember any in agriculture.

01:58.059 --> 02:16.020
I know that some of the engineering courses and particularly the math courses were supposed to be particularly bad, but I don't really remember anything that I came in contact with.

02:17.762 --> 02:21.767
Was there any kind of nickname that you ag majors acquired?

02:23.975 --> 02:24.917
I've never heard of one.

02:24.937 --> 02:25.798
Not that I remember.

02:25.838 --> 02:30.727
And so you changed your major to Ag Administration when?

02:31.549 --> 02:32.490
My junior year.

02:32.651 --> 02:32.951
Oh.

02:32.991 --> 02:34.033
Before my junior year.

02:34.053 --> 02:34.694
Okay.

02:34.714 --> 02:34.935
All right.

02:34.975 --> 02:38.942
So between my sophomore and junior year.

02:38.962 --> 02:46.776
Were there any, as far as you were aware, first year or two, were there any easy courses that were, everybody made an easy grade?

02:51.127 --> 02:52.411
Yeah, but I'm trying to think.

02:52.531 --> 02:53.494
I don't recall.

02:54.296 --> 03:02.520
We didn't have things like recreation and parks and some of those that

03:04.492 --> 03:05.874
I have a reputation today.

03:06.175 --> 03:09.299
Now, when I got here, Dr. Dan Russell's.

03:09.320 --> 03:09.420
Okay.

03:09.440 --> 03:12.344
Dan Russell's course in sociology was considered that.

03:12.525 --> 03:14.928
Okay.

03:14.948 --> 03:22.961
And I don't think it was deserved, but I think Bob Skrbonik's course in population was kind of considered in that category.

03:23.361 --> 03:25.745
But as I say, I thought it was a good course.

03:26.226 --> 03:30.212
Were there supposedly any special courses for athletes?

03:32.032 --> 03:33.314
I wasn't aware of it.

03:33.334 --> 03:34.055
I've never heard of any.

03:35.898 --> 03:39.163
There may well have been, but I don't.

03:39.183 --> 03:41.607
I just wasn't that tuned to it.

03:41.627 --> 03:48.679
And were there some courses that somebody told you, oh, no matter what, you want to be sure and take a course from this person or this person?

03:54.748 --> 03:59.035
Somebody that was a... Well, I think...

04:02.221 --> 04:05.086
Ralph Steen had that reputation.

04:08.271 --> 04:12.177
And to a lesser extent, Dr. Mayo.

04:12.618 --> 04:16.063
I mean, I think some of those people are English.

04:18.547 --> 04:21.071
You know, you haven't asked me when I thought you'd ask.

04:21.131 --> 04:21.452
What's that?

04:21.552 --> 04:23.675
That was the March on the President's Home.

04:24.216 --> 04:25.478
Oh, oh, yes.

04:26.504 --> 04:28.107
Describe all of that.

04:28.127 --> 04:29.951
Yes, I forgot that.

04:29.971 --> 04:30.572
Oh, yes.

04:30.853 --> 04:33.258
Because that's your first- My freshman year.

04:33.278 --> 04:34.240
Yes.

04:34.260 --> 04:34.881
Oh, describe that.

04:35.763 --> 04:38.809
Well, we come back from Christmas and, of course,

04:40.274 --> 04:45.767
Everything had really been boiling that fall semester.

04:46.389 --> 04:48.173
And what was the issue?

04:48.193 --> 04:51.340
Gibb Gilchrist, the hazing, the paddling, the use of the board.

04:51.521 --> 04:53.124
And it was supposed to have stopped?

04:53.846 --> 04:54.147
Yes.

04:54.849 --> 04:57.996
And the legislature was getting involved.

04:57.976 --> 05:07.251
Gib Gilchrist had taken over and had ordered that be stopped and was cracking down.

05:08.513 --> 05:16.886
And so the upperclassmen, the seniors, decided to march on his home one night.

05:18.749 --> 05:24.338
And they turned in their sabers and commissions

05:25.988 --> 05:29.331
And I was in the front rank right in front of his house.

05:30.833 --> 05:33.696
Scared to death.

05:33.716 --> 05:35.017
Didn't know what was going to happen.

05:35.838 --> 05:38.141
And he came out on the porch?

05:38.161 --> 05:39.262
He came out on the porch.

05:39.562 --> 05:40.703
And accepted there?

05:41.084 --> 05:42.065
Yes, yes.

05:42.906 --> 05:48.131
And it was, those were traumatic times.

05:48.311 --> 05:51.034
What was his, didn't he make a brief statement?

05:51.436 --> 05:54.999
Yes, but I don't recall anything about the statement.

05:55.019 --> 05:56.421
I just remember how scared I was.

05:56.681 --> 05:58.142
Because he didn't back down.

05:58.162 --> 05:58.483
Oh, no.

05:58.743 --> 05:59.964
No, he didn't back down.

05:59.984 --> 06:01.265
No.

06:01.285 --> 06:02.587
No, he didn't back down at all.

06:03.708 --> 06:07.571
Let me look back now.

06:08.693 --> 06:12.997
How did, how well did President Gilchrist handle that crisis?

06:13.497 --> 06:15.559
Oh, I think he handled it appropriately.

06:16.000 --> 06:19.603
I mean, it was, there was open rebellion.

06:19.583 --> 06:23.046
He didn't give in and, you know, he shouldn't have given in.

06:24.627 --> 06:31.493
If you read any of the newspaper accounts at that time, the legislature was all over them about the hazing problem.

06:32.074 --> 06:32.895
And did it stop?

06:33.855 --> 06:34.076
No.

06:35.076 --> 06:35.437
Well, did it?

06:35.457 --> 06:36.638
It went farther underground.

06:36.838 --> 06:37.338
Oh, did it?

06:37.358 --> 06:37.919
Oh, okay.

06:38.299 --> 06:38.700
Okay.

06:39.000 --> 06:42.403
And what do you mean by farther underground?

06:42.423 --> 06:44.465
Well, I mean they just hid it more.

06:44.725 --> 06:45.185
Oh, okay.

06:45.205 --> 06:46.506
It just wasn't as visible.

06:47.187 --> 06:49.489
Why was there more hazing that way?

06:50.228 --> 06:52.993
fall than there had been other years.

06:54.115 --> 06:56.640
Was it because the war was over?

06:56.680 --> 07:11.629
No, I think as I've looked back on it and tried to reflect on that, that we had officers in the Corps who were two or three years younger than they normally would have been.

07:12.301 --> 07:16.919
because classes had been accelerated during the war as a result of the war.

07:17.943 --> 07:22.480
And so we had 18 to 19-year-olds in command positions

07:22.747 --> 07:25.550
Whereas normally they'd been 21 or 22-year-old people.

07:25.570 --> 07:27.332
So they had not matured.

07:27.672 --> 07:30.875
They didn't have the maturity to do it.

07:31.636 --> 07:37.242
Then the next year, was there anything like that kind of problem?

07:37.382 --> 07:39.604
No, that was the last that we had.

07:39.644 --> 07:43.388
Describe President Gilchrist from your viewpoint.

07:45.650 --> 07:47.712
First of all, what did he look like physically?

07:48.072 --> 07:50.695
And then describe his nature.

07:51.890 --> 07:54.413
He was a rather tall, balding man.

07:55.835 --> 08:10.776
By tall, I'd say probably six feet, balding or bald, wore glasses.

08:13.439 --> 08:20.105
I knew him at church also, and not in a personal way, but he knew my name.

08:20.245 --> 08:22.086
He knew what I was, and he'd speak to me.

08:22.447 --> 08:32.095
I think he probably did a good job for the university at that time in that position.

08:34.036 --> 08:34.277
All right.

08:34.497 --> 08:36.539
Then you finished your sophomore year.

08:36.599 --> 08:39.481
What did you do that summer?

08:39.501 --> 08:40.742
I mean, you finished your freshman year.

08:42.524 --> 08:43.024
Went to Europe.

08:44.928 --> 08:45.449
How so?

08:47.150 --> 08:48.351
How, why, where?

08:49.312 --> 08:54.277
Went on a study tour sponsored by Columbia University.

08:55.398 --> 08:56.339
How'd you land that?

08:56.359 --> 08:59.542
It was advertised in the New York Times.

09:00.403 --> 09:00.924
Where'd you go?

09:02.385 --> 09:05.408
Went to England, to France, Switzerland.

09:07.250 --> 09:08.431
England, France, Switzerland.

09:10.333 --> 09:14.277
That was pretty good for a young man from Orange Grove, Texas.

09:15.202 --> 09:19.927
Yeah, it was a real interesting experience.

09:20.768 --> 09:24.872
And you were gone how long?

09:25.372 --> 09:25.893
Three weeks.

09:27.414 --> 09:28.295
And then how?

09:28.315 --> 09:30.077
Well, the trip was three weeks.

09:30.097 --> 09:41.428
We went over by ship and converted

09:43.315 --> 09:47.200
troop ships, of course that's soon after the war.

09:50.243 --> 09:54.268
You know, excuse me, that was the end of my sophomore year I went here, 48.

09:54.288 --> 09:54.528
All right.

09:54.969 --> 09:57.252
In 47 I just went back home.

09:57.552 --> 09:58.413
And did what?

09:58.954 --> 10:00.636
Just worked on the ranch.

10:02.838 --> 10:08.665
All right, and then when you come back as a sophomore, why was life better, different?

10:10.349 --> 10:17.259
We're the only class in history that was low man on the totem pole two years in a row because they put all the freshmen out at the annex.

10:18.842 --> 10:23.168
So we were the low men on the totem pole a second year.

10:24.270 --> 10:31.580
About the only difference was we didn't have to wear fish stripes and we didn't have to do mate service.

10:31.600 --> 10:35.707
When did you all learn that that arrangement was going to come about?

10:36.628 --> 10:37.369
I don't remember.

10:38.632 --> 10:41.079
I just don't remember.

10:41.721 --> 10:43.125
And the dorms were full.

10:44.349 --> 10:45.813
Were classes full also?

10:46.194 --> 10:46.635
Oh, yes.

10:47.498 --> 10:47.758
Yes.

10:47.778 --> 10:51.088
In fact, we had temporary buildings for classrooms.

10:51.659 --> 10:54.863
And I presume lots of new faculty?

10:54.963 --> 10:57.265
And we had night classes, too.

10:57.285 --> 10:57.586
Really?

10:57.946 --> 10:59.288
Yes, sir.

10:59.308 --> 11:04.053
No, space was in short supply.

11:04.974 --> 11:08.618
And the community around the campus physically, where was it?

11:09.119 --> 11:10.561
Where did it extend to?

11:12.122 --> 11:14.866
The places where there were residences, where people lived?

11:14.886 --> 11:20.552
Well, not very far away from the campus.

11:21.697 --> 11:24.441
Do you know where the Bryson House is in College Station?

11:24.481 --> 11:26.764
That was about the end of that.

11:28.467 --> 11:45.371
You had North Oakwood up here in Bryan that had been opened up before the war, and had a little bit out the East Gate, probably out Walton Drive, and then at the North Gate there was a lot of vacant space.

11:46.172 --> 11:49.797
What businesses were there near the campus?

11:52.072 --> 12:01.086
Well, as I say, hardware stores, variety stores, excuse me, Hanberger joints.

12:01.486 --> 12:03.770
We used to have the theater down there at the end.

12:04.631 --> 12:06.514
Campus theater was already there.

12:07.435 --> 12:15.447
Excuse me, it was built while I was in school, probably built through freshman year.

12:15.427 --> 12:17.190
And we had movies on campus.

12:17.390 --> 12:20.956
We had Guyon Hall and the old assembly hall.

12:21.777 --> 12:26.825
When you and your buddies went to Guyon Hall, what was the behavior pattern?

12:26.865 --> 12:31.212
What did Aggies do during the movie in Guyon Hall?

12:31.232 --> 12:32.294
I don't remember any problem.

12:32.574 --> 12:33.756
Didn't people whoop?

12:34.006 --> 12:37.470
Oh yeah, that's just normal A&M.

12:37.490 --> 12:38.692
I mean, no.

12:39.914 --> 12:43.598
And sometimes boo and sometimes hiss, is that right?

12:43.618 --> 12:49.205
Yeah, I just took that as natural, being on campus.

12:49.446 --> 12:55.593
And was there, were there many people in Guyon Hall movies except students?

12:57.736 --> 12:58.377
Some of them.

12:59.723 --> 13:04.650
Some of the faculty and people in the area would be there, but predominantly students.

13:05.932 --> 13:12.060
How did you students relate to the faculty and staff that lived on the campus?

13:12.621 --> 13:17.968
Did you all intrude on, did the typical students intrude on their area very much?

13:19.298 --> 13:21.380
I don't remember a problem.

13:21.581 --> 13:26.967
I just remember going through there on the way to and from class and to the railroad station and.

13:27.027 --> 13:28.649
It was okay to walk through.

13:28.689 --> 13:29.650
Yeah.

13:29.670 --> 13:30.371
Oh, yeah.

13:30.391 --> 13:36.438
But it was not okay to make noise over there and I've never heard of it.

13:36.458 --> 13:37.519
I don't remember a problem.

13:37.579 --> 13:38.560
I've never heard of it.

13:38.580 --> 13:40.442
I don't recall any kind of problem.

13:40.462 --> 13:44.527
Of course, by that time, there weren't many people living on campus.

13:44.727 --> 13:45.828
Is that right?

13:45.848 --> 13:47.230
They probably weren't over.

13:48.543 --> 13:49.949
10 or 12 houses left.

13:50.170 --> 13:53.342
Oh, oh, so it was down?

13:53.945 --> 13:57.017
It's basically where the MSC is today.

13:58.280 --> 14:02.706
And then old lot 60, weren't there a few there?

14:04.128 --> 14:06.171
Where the coldest building is now, weren't there a few?

14:07.674 --> 14:12.601
Yeah, but on Throckmorton Street, there were still two or three.

14:12.841 --> 14:13.702
I remember Dr. R.D.

14:13.722 --> 14:17.107
Lewis lived on the corner, Throckmorton and Joe Rout, I guess it is.

14:18.269 --> 14:22.515
There were three or four along there, but I bet they weren't.

14:24.132 --> 14:28.459
I'm going to say a dozen houses left, but probably not over 20.

14:29.660 --> 14:38.714
At Guyton Hall, do you remember during your student days any celebrity visitors to the campus?

14:38.734 --> 14:38.995
Oh, yeah.

14:39.015 --> 14:42.540
We had Victor Barga and Red Skelton.

14:45.224 --> 14:49.671
We had an active entertainment program.

14:49.991 --> 14:51.073
Did you all go to those?

14:51.313 --> 14:52.095
Oh, yes.

14:52.115 --> 14:52.435
Yes.

14:53.377 --> 14:55.099
In fact, I became town hall manager.

14:55.399 --> 14:55.760
Oh, really?

14:56.340 --> 14:57.361
Describe, describe.

14:57.882 --> 14:58.523
Describe that.

14:59.444 --> 15:05.310
Well, I worked for Spike White and made $100 a month out of it.

15:07.092 --> 15:09.415
Big money for that era.

15:09.595 --> 15:16.382
But we had, oh yeah, we had a good program, balanced program.

15:19.025 --> 15:22.489
Not the popular stuff that you have today, but.

15:23.701 --> 15:27.610
More of the classical type concerts and so forth.

15:28.813 --> 15:30.497
Those were all held in Gunn Hall.

15:30.557 --> 15:32.421
And they came by train or bus?

15:32.441 --> 15:33.203
Oh, yes.

15:33.223 --> 15:33.905
By train or bus.

15:34.226 --> 15:39.618
Yeah, both.

15:39.638 --> 15:41.743
Yeah, Burl Ives.

15:42.837 --> 15:46.982
We had, we had good, good entertainment.

15:47.222 --> 15:53.310
What about political or business celebrities during your student days?

15:54.511 --> 15:57.474
You remember any presidents, senators?

15:57.955 --> 16:02.360
No, I don't remember any, anything that we went out of the way for.

16:05.945 --> 16:08.828
Were you aware that the MSC was being planned?

16:10.225 --> 16:23.220
Yes, but it didn't, well, they had removed the houses to make way for it, but I don't believe any construction had started before I graduated.

16:23.680 --> 16:26.483
Did you, was Wayne Stark appointed or do you?

16:26.503 --> 16:28.506
Wayne Stark was already there.

16:28.746 --> 16:30.768
And did you meet him by chance during?

16:31.249 --> 16:35.794
I had met him, but just casually I hadn't.

16:37.377 --> 16:39.360
really had any contact with him.

16:41.283 --> 16:43.988
What about the campus medical facilities?

16:45.791 --> 16:47.013
Describe the Quack Shack.

16:47.033 --> 16:48.195
Where was it and who was it?

16:48.215 --> 16:50.639
We didn't call it the Quack Shack in those days.

16:50.659 --> 16:51.160
Oh, you didn't?

16:51.180 --> 16:52.101
That's a newer term.

16:52.582 --> 16:54.064
Surely you all had a nickname for it.

16:58.031 --> 16:58.872
Trying to think.

17:00.395 --> 17:04.802
Dr. Marsh was the doctor.

17:07.651 --> 17:12.240
Oh, our classmate of mine was here a while back.

17:13.863 --> 17:24.124
We were talking about Dr. Marsh and said one of his claims to fame was the number of appendectomies he did.

17:25.403 --> 17:34.316
and apparently he got $100 extra for every appendectomy he did.

17:34.336 --> 17:42.908
But the head nurse was Mom Claghorn, and she was well known and was a motherly type.

17:43.369 --> 17:46.273
You could go over there and get sympathy from her.

17:49.317 --> 17:53.503
So that part was good, but she didn't want to go over there unless she had to.

17:55.289 --> 18:07.764
Describe the student body in general, their values, their diversity, their geographic background, economically rich, poor, and so forth.

18:10.868 --> 18:13.772
Where were Aggies from then?

18:13.792 --> 18:20.520
Of course most were from Texas, but one of the interesting things to me was the number of Mexican Americans we had.

18:21.884 --> 18:23.365
Please discuss them.

18:23.385 --> 18:31.052
A&M has always had a good number of Mexican Americans from Laredo and the Valley.

18:33.374 --> 18:35.456
I don't remember many from El Paso.

18:35.476 --> 18:36.337
How were they treated?

18:36.497 --> 18:37.177
South Texas.

18:39.319 --> 18:41.361
As far as I could tell, just one of the boys.

18:44.804 --> 18:46.345
Predominantly from Texas.

18:47.727 --> 18:49.668
Rural or urban?

18:49.688 --> 18:50.389
Both.

18:51.365 --> 19:01.738
Probably a pretty good cross-section of the population of Texas at that time, east, west, north, south.

19:04.221 --> 19:13.693
I think I was surprised at the number of people from the Panhandle in that part of the state, but we had

19:15.597 --> 19:16.918
They've been all over, remember?

19:17.058 --> 19:19.100
Beaumont, Valley.

19:21.863 --> 19:22.283
In terms of?

19:22.303 --> 19:24.805
San Antonio was always a big, baggy town.

19:25.125 --> 19:27.067
In terms of their religious backgrounds.

19:32.252 --> 19:37.637
Again, I think it pretty much reflected the population of the state.

19:39.198 --> 19:43.782
It was interesting, the Catholics had just that small little chapel.

19:45.280 --> 19:46.081
at that time.

19:47.644 --> 19:52.071
So we must not have had as many Catholics, relatively, or else they've grown.

19:52.111 --> 19:58.542
There were some Jewish youngsters?

19:58.562 --> 19:59.323
A few Jews.

20:00.225 --> 20:09.921
In fact, I received an award for interfaith.

20:11.538 --> 20:21.092
programs, Hillel Foundation Award given by Mrs. Tobbenhaus, who was the widow of a professor of

20:24.110 --> 20:25.632
Plant physiology, I want to say.

20:26.353 --> 20:28.035
Hillel Foundation already existed.

20:28.296 --> 20:29.798
Hillel Foundation already existed.

20:29.938 --> 20:31.540
Where did they meet?

20:31.700 --> 20:34.864
In the Y. Okay.

20:35.185 --> 20:48.362
Did anybody have a nickname because of their, two or three of the folks I've interviewed have said they were nicknamed Jew Boy, but they quickly said it was not a put down, it was simply an identifier.

20:49.810 --> 20:50.491
I don't remember.

20:50.511 --> 20:53.795
I don't remember any kind of anti-Semitism.

20:55.077 --> 20:56.859
Well, they didn't think it was.

20:56.879 --> 20:57.800
At all.

20:58.842 --> 21:05.070
And were some of the Hispanics, did they have nicknames, which today would be politically incorrect?

21:05.811 --> 21:06.011
No.

21:06.892 --> 21:07.073
No.

21:07.273 --> 21:15.784
As I say, I was always amazed that they were accepted without any

21:17.198 --> 21:18.083
Not any problem.

21:18.243 --> 21:20.455
Were there many international students?

21:21.078 --> 21:25.099
No, and the ones that there were were

21:26.969 --> 21:31.695
graduate students, so we didn't come in contact with them.

21:31.715 --> 21:46.453
We had a few American expatriates, or sons of American expatriates, Venezuela and Peru, I remember, but we had some out of Mexico.

21:47.194 --> 21:56.605
We did have some, in fact, and I had a fellow in my outfit from Guatemala, so we had a few, but

21:56.990 --> 21:58.812
How was he treated?

21:59.914 --> 22:00.715
Like everybody else.

22:01.075 --> 22:03.838
What was the key?

22:03.858 --> 22:04.599
What was the secret?

22:05.781 --> 22:06.181
I don't know.

22:06.822 --> 22:08.083
Once you were an Aggie, you were an Aggie.

22:09.485 --> 22:11.608
That's the only explanation I could give.

22:11.628 --> 22:12.689
I think that's the key.

22:13.750 --> 22:15.212
All were treated the same?

22:15.252 --> 22:24.263
But I never saw any kind of what I'd call discrimination.

22:25.424 --> 22:34.632
Well, there might have been some joking, but there wasn't anything that was considered fancy.

22:34.913 --> 22:36.754
Did most students have nicknames then?

22:38.676 --> 22:39.997
Was that comparatively common?

22:40.758 --> 22:44.661
I don't remember that as much as it apparently was earlier.

22:44.862 --> 22:45.462
Okay.

22:45.482 --> 22:51.047
And I don't remember the profs' nicknames the way some people do.

22:51.067 --> 22:54.030
You're inferring you don't remember the nickname that you had?

22:55.006 --> 22:59.330
No.

23:00.492 --> 23:05.016
Let's see, what kind of vehicles did, how many cars were there probably?

23:06.638 --> 23:15.387
Well, it wasn't like Dick Conley and General Simpson when they said there were, I think, 17 cars in 1937.

23:15.427 --> 23:19.191
There were a lot of cars here.

23:21.179 --> 23:29.467
Freshman couldn't have cars, but the cars had started coming by that time.

23:31.149 --> 23:47.625
A cousin of mine bought a 1946 Chevrolet with everything on it, $1,200 to put things in perspective, put my fees that I gave you all in perspective.

23:48.162 --> 23:51.707
Where did, where did students park their cars then?

23:53.530 --> 23:55.814
Well, there seemed to be enough just on the streets.

23:57.236 --> 23:58.538
Because those parking lots?

23:58.558 --> 23:59.880
There weren't very many parking lots.

24:00.120 --> 24:01.683
None were paved that I recall.

24:05.909 --> 24:07.812
Was there a religious emphasis week then?

24:08.032 --> 24:08.213
Yes.

24:08.894 --> 24:09.715
Describe it.

24:12.277 --> 24:30.298
Well, we would bring in a nationally known figure who would speak in Guyon Hall every day and then would go around and visit the different churches.

24:32.040 --> 24:37.606
And as I recall, each church would bring it, would bring in a minister.

24:38.046 --> 24:38.487
And so.

24:38.827 --> 24:41.170
And classes were dismissed at 10 o'clock?

24:43.833 --> 24:45.456
I mean, the 10 to 11 hour was?

24:46.437 --> 24:50.924
I don't remember the hour, but it was in the morning and classes were dismissed, yeah.

24:50.944 --> 24:52.867
Did the average student go to?

24:53.929 --> 24:58.095
Well, guy in the hall he couldn't have.

24:58.115 --> 25:02.382
But as I recall, guy in the hall was pretty full.

25:04.623 --> 25:09.838
What did y'all think of as an undergrad, of Ronald Simms this week?

25:09.859 --> 25:11.022
Did people make fun of it?

25:11.704 --> 25:12.226
No, no.

25:12.246 --> 25:16.438
It was accepted as, at least to my knowledge it wasn't.

25:16.790 --> 25:19.154
Of course I was on the inside of a lot of it, so.

25:20.316 --> 25:20.877
And when did you?

25:20.917 --> 25:22.319
Might not have known.

25:23.000 --> 25:28.689
Now you began to get involved in the Methodist youth activities even as a freshman?

25:28.990 --> 25:30.933
Yes, and the Y also.

25:30.953 --> 25:31.674
And the Y, okay.

25:32.055 --> 25:41.430
And the Y was the Pager campus organization that sponsored the religious emphasis week.

25:42.068 --> 25:54.689
Now the campus personalities of that era, President Gilchrist, who were the other key campus leaders?

25:54.709 --> 26:00.479
Gilchrist, for a student, was very aloof.

26:01.360 --> 26:04.926
We didn't see much of him or have much contact with him.

26:04.946 --> 26:06.068
Who were the other key?

26:07.060 --> 26:07.921
Well, H.L.

26:07.941 --> 26:13.086
Heaton was the registrar, of course, and everybody knew who he was.

26:18.252 --> 26:33.388
The deans, respective deans, were well known, who were probably better known relatively than today, who were shepherds in agriculture.

26:35.393 --> 26:44.023
Brooks, liberal arts, or arts and sciences at that time.

26:45.644 --> 26:46.145
Engineering?

26:48.688 --> 26:52.112
Barlow, and I'm trying to think one before.

26:52.132 --> 26:55.916
It was Mary Eccles' father.

26:59.220 --> 27:01.342
Not Butler.

27:02.483 --> 27:02.864
Bolton.

27:02.904 --> 27:03.404
Bolton.

27:03.905 --> 27:05.046
Bolton.

27:05.633 --> 27:08.239
Dean of Engineering, and then Barlow took his place.

27:11.005 --> 27:11.526
Who was coming?

27:11.546 --> 27:20.105
Veterinary Medicine was, hmm.

27:20.125 --> 27:21.288
That's a blank right now.

27:22.290 --> 27:23.893
Who was to come about?

27:23.913 --> 27:24.655
Malai.

27:26.238 --> 27:35.512
who went in Korea and a number of our classmates were over there that were done during Korea.

27:35.532 --> 27:37.936
Well, Malloy and then Boatner.

27:38.657 --> 27:43.244
Hayden L. Boatner.

27:43.264 --> 27:52.178
In, were there any during, and you graduated in four years, were there any events during those four years

27:53.153 --> 28:04.285
where you remember where you were when you heard the news that, you know, a Pearl Harbor or a D-Day or an atomic bomb like, I can't think of any.

28:06.687 --> 28:06.948
Well.

28:07.208 --> 28:08.870
You're two years ahead of me and I'm trying to.

28:09.170 --> 28:14.375
I'm trying to think when the Texas City explosion was.

28:14.395 --> 28:16.718
Oh, yes, yes.

28:16.998 --> 28:18.039
That's the spring of 47.

28:18.099 --> 28:20.562
That was a major event.

28:22.752 --> 28:26.616
But on campus, I don't.

28:26.636 --> 28:35.024
But also, you know, the Korean War starts in the summer of 50, and you wouldn't have been on campus at that time.

28:35.285 --> 28:39.429
Well, and I don't remember anything leading up to the Korean War.

28:39.469 --> 28:40.970
I remember it as a big surprise.

28:40.990 --> 28:41.751
Yeah, same here.

28:42.352 --> 28:44.214
I agree with you.

28:44.374 --> 28:46.336
I don't recall anything.

28:47.957 --> 28:49.519
You know, Harry Truman was,

28:51.743 --> 28:55.050
in this part of the world, not liked.

28:56.694 --> 29:03.128
And we had a speaker from the New York Times here in the town, in the, what do you call it?

29:04.351 --> 29:06.335
It was a speaking, and we brought in speakers.

29:06.355 --> 29:06.937
Great issues.

29:07.077 --> 29:07.558
Great issues.

29:09.243 --> 29:13.288
And I want to say it's Harrison Salisbury, but that may not be right.

29:14.630 --> 29:21.940
But I remember he spoke, and he made a statement that history will be kind to Harry Truman.

29:23.101 --> 29:25.665
And I thought at the time, you know, how can that be?

29:28.689 --> 29:31.973
Because we didn't care for Harry Truman.

29:31.993 --> 29:33.475
But he was born out, certainly.

29:34.536 --> 29:38.001
All right, now, when do you go to summer camp for the first time?

29:37.981 --> 29:42.529
in my junior year, between junior and senior year.

29:44.252 --> 29:45.173
Forty-six, forty-eight?

29:45.194 --> 29:46.315
It's forty-eight.

29:46.335 --> 29:47.097
Summer of forty-eight.

29:47.157 --> 29:48.740
Forty-eight, okay.

29:48.760 --> 29:49.401
Excuse me, excuse me.

29:50.503 --> 29:51.404
Summer of forty-nine.

29:51.785 --> 29:52.566
Where'd you go?

29:53.268 --> 29:54.490
Brooksville, San Antonio.

29:54.830 --> 29:58.757
And what was that like for an Aggie?

30:00.188 --> 30:02.939
It was pretty routine.

30:03.863 --> 30:10.047
We were thrown in with these kids from other ROTC programs and

30:11.056 --> 30:12.779
We really thought we were superior.

30:14.041 --> 30:15.062
Do you think you really were?

30:15.723 --> 30:16.244
I think so.

30:16.685 --> 30:18.027
That you were better prepared?

30:18.307 --> 30:27.382
Well, we'd come through the, the Corps leadership and they were taking it, you see, just a few hours a week.

30:27.402 --> 30:28.704
And it was completely different.

30:28.784 --> 30:32.430
And were most of these from, most of the others there were from the Southwest?

30:35.435 --> 30:38.920
I think went up to Illinois in that area.

30:39.743 --> 30:46.193
I'm not sure, I don't think it was nationwide, but I think maybe well represented in the center part.

30:46.713 --> 30:54.500
Then the next summer, you graduate in the spring of 50.

30:55.921 --> 30:56.802
June 1, 50.

30:58.623 --> 31:02.606
So that the Korean War starts after you.

31:03.227 --> 31:04.908
Richard and I go to Europe that summer.

31:06.770 --> 31:07.130
Richard?

31:07.631 --> 31:08.071
My brother.

31:08.331 --> 31:10.533
Oh, to do what?

31:10.553 --> 31:11.534
Just tourism.

31:11.674 --> 31:12.455
Just to tour Europe.

31:12.715 --> 31:13.856
Oh, hell yeah.

31:13.876 --> 31:16.298
And so the Korean War happens while we're up.
