00:04.672 --> 00:06.675
Where could I get politically involved? So I wrote 
letters to all of the clubs explaining to them

00:06.695 --> 00:13.987
about the University Fund. So I get this letter 
from this lawyer in Divine or Pleasant, and I

00:15.169 --> 00:24.244
forget. He says, I was starting up a a gossip about 
the Permanent University Fund that never could

00:28.668 --> 00:34.404
be, nothing had been said about it. And somebody 
from that club had given him the letter So then I

00:41.290 --> 00:43.713
called Mr. Cherry and read him the letter. And he 
said, well, Ms. Gonzalez, he's a lawyer. He should

00:47.637 --> 00:48.317
know. And I said, well, this is what he wrote me. So I 
drove up here, met with Mr. Cherry, and he said,

00:50.840 --> 00:55.065
well, what can we do? I said, you need to write up 
what the permanent university fund is, what it

00:55.085 --> 01:10.521
will do if they break it, and put a little brochure 
and send it to all the former students, and then put

00:55.085 --> 01:10.521
it on the Texas Aggie. So that's what we did. I still 
have some of those flyers that they were sent home.

01:16.498 --> 01:17.981
And boy, they started. And at that time I was 
working on, Martha Neese from the Valley and I were

01:19.163 --> 01:34.551
working on the library bill to have standards to 
have a library for so many students in each school.

01:35.898 --> 01:41.331
And the senator from Conroe was working with us 
because his wife was a librarian. And he had been,

01:42.213 --> 01:54.261
he had lost a leg in Vietnam and the assistant to 
Clemens at that time had lost a leg and they were

01:42.213 --> 01:54.261
good friends. So we were working on a library bill, 
and I was going, having to go to Austin and Martha

01:55.540 --> 02:07.995
Neese and several other librarians to draw up a 
bill with this senator. And we worked on that, and

02:09.798 --> 02:13.222
we worked on the Permanent University Fund. We'd 
take cookies to some of the legislators. And we

02:17.687 --> 02:20.891
finally got that, Mr. Chair and I, in talking, 
finally got it, you know, they didn't break it. And

02:25.747 --> 02:30.736
we got our library bill through, and I said, oh, 
never again. Now, what led you to be library

02:32.439 --> 02:35.424
concerned? Librarian? Ever since I was a little 
girl, I always wanted to be a librarian. All right.

02:43.659 --> 02:46.343
And that led you to be interested in A&M's library? 
Oh, yes. I served on the library council. If you

02:51.245 --> 03:03.044
were giving advice to Texas A&M's leaders now 
about today and the future of A&M, what advice

02:51.245 --> 03:03.044
would you give them? I

03:03.164 --> 03:18.028
would tell them that academics are stressed,

03:03.164 --> 03:18.028
loyalty is stressed, but I think The thing that 
they should keep in mind is where A&M came from.

03:23.816 --> 03:33.986
That's what they should stress to the students, 
how A&M evolved and what sacrifices were made to

03:23.816 --> 03:33.986
have A&M. And not just rest on the glory right now of 
being a great university. How did it come to be that

03:39.932 --> 03:42.574
great university? See, that's what we're trying 
to learn more of this.

03:49.531 --> 03:51.153
Well I'm about finished. Can you think of anything 
we've left out? No, like I said, don't let A&M lose

03:53.477 --> 03:58.725
its traditions. Keep the students informed on how 
A&M is about to be this great university. What

04:08.740 --> 04:18.475
difference has it made in your life that your 
brother and your husband and your son attended

04:08.740 --> 04:18.475
Texas A&M? Well, it has made me very proud to be a 
sister of, well, my seven brothers came here. My

04:28.343 --> 04:35.110
oldest brother worked for A&M Experiment Station 
for 50 years as an agronomer, and he's truly naggy.

04:35.971 --> 04:40.155
I have, of course, my husband and my son. I have four 
nieces that graduated from A&M and four nephews

04:40.936 --> 04:47.123
that have graduated. And they have given us the 
opportunity and given them the opportunity to

04:48.024 --> 04:56.072
become very productive citizens and 
outstanding. All right, then the next last

04:57.503 --> 05:19.273
question is, what if someone walked up to you and 
gave you a check for a million dollars with one

04:57.503 --> 05:19.273
restriction, that you have to pass that check on to 
Texas A&M, but you can decide the use A&M is to make

04:57.503 --> 05:19.273
of that check. If you could be very, very, very 
generous to A&M, what would you want your gift to

05:19.674 --> 05:25.722
do? I would like my gift to do to expand the library, 
expand the programs here at the Memorial Student

05:26.410 --> 05:39.111
Center and the School for Teaching Excellence.

05:41.676 --> 05:45.202
And in the library, any particular thing you'd 
want them to do? Well,

05:45.702 --> 05:52.654
just to where they could buy more books. More 
reading material. I think we're stressing

05:55.596 --> 05:58.479
technology too much. People need to sit and read 
and lose themselves in a book, not just punch

06:00.080 --> 06:08.348
machines.

06:11.091 --> 06:12.913
Last question. What feelings do you carry in your 
heart about Texas A&M? It's just wonderful

06:19.640 --> 06:23.063
feelings, a feeling of pride. a feeling that I have 
been part of A&M, and a feeling that we were welcome

06:24.140 --> 06:36.046
here at A&M. That's a good ending.
