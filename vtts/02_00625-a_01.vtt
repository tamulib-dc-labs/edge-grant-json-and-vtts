00:15.522 --> 00:24.072
The first series of questions I should like to ask 
have to do with your academic background and your

00:15.522 --> 00:24.072
interest in oceanography.

00:25.754 --> 00:31.320
How and when did you acquire an interest in marine 
biology and oceanography? Well, how far back do

00:31.340 --> 00:32.742
you want to go? Wherever the beginning is. Really, 
I would describe it to my mother, who grew up in

00:35.705 --> 00:44.415
Gloucester, and they come from a fishing family. 
And ever since I was born, that's the age of three

00:45.323 --> 00:56.897
months, we would spend summers in an island in 
Maine and explore the beaches. And she had the

00:57.137 --> 01:04.766
training and background to explain primarily the 
biology, not necessarily the physical

00:57.137 --> 01:04.766
oceanography of the beaches. And we did that until 
really I went off to school for 16 years. We would

01:09.452 --> 01:14.858
spend the entire summer from the end of school to 
the beginning until Labor Day. So I would say that

01:15.918 --> 01:18.560
was really the very beginning. Yeah. You're from 
Massachusetts, right? Yeah. OK. Why did you

01:22.864 --> 01:26.647
choose the University of Washington? Well, of 
course, the time that I would be going to school,

01:29.029 --> 01:35.054
this was wartime in the 40s. And the University of 
Washington, I didn't come to some time. I spent

01:41.500 --> 01:42.841
some time at sea. This was my interest in being at 
sea. And I was a graduate of the Massachusetts

01:45.972 --> 01:54.862
Maritime Academy, in which we studied 
meteorology. And it really wasn't considered

01:55.122 --> 01:59.767
oceanography, but it was the science of the sea, 
marine science. And at the end of the war,

02:01.129 --> 02:15.304
well, let me say during the war, I worked as a ship's 
officer with the Army Transportation Corps.

02:15.790 --> 02:38.338
graduated from the academy with a commission as 
ensign in the navy but rather than go right into the

02:15.790 --> 02:38.338
navy i went into the large ship area of army 
transportation corps at the end of the war i had

02:15.790 --> 02:38.338
some navy duty and became involved in submarines 
so i i have a master's license in the maritime

02:39.365 --> 02:56.792
service and acquired that at age 23 and felt that I 
had explored that and I had some tour in the Navy

02:39.365 --> 02:56.792
qualified submarine officer and felt that I had 
explored that and was interested in a further in

02:39.365 --> 02:56.792
the study of the science of the sea oceanography. 
This was available to naval officers at the Naval

02:57.173 --> 03:06.908
Postgraduate School which was attached or had 
some role with Scripps and I was interested in that

03:08.542 --> 03:11.766
program, but wasn't eligible for it. So I got out of 
the Navy. And one of the ship's officers' father

03:14.710 --> 03:22.620
was the provost at Rhode Island, University of 
Rhode Island. And he wrote to me and told me about

03:22.960 --> 03:31.791
the Dr. Fishers, the two Dr. Fishers at Rhode 
Island. And he recommended that I go to the

03:31.871 --> 03:37.418
University of Washington because it was a new 
school, and they were starting a new program

03:37.921 --> 03:40.705
exclusively in oceanography. So it came as a 
result of the Navy and a recommendation from the

03:40.725 --> 03:48.336
provost at the University of Rhode Island. You 
arrived here at Washington about the same time

03:48.356 --> 03:52.702
Fleming got here to establish the school. Just 
after. He arrived in 51 and I was here in 53, early in

03:53.523 --> 04:00.733
53. And you stayed until 55. Did you go to school 
full-time between 1953 and 1955? Yes, actually, I

04:08.807 --> 04:13.212
stayed until 1957. Okay.

04:17.477 --> 04:19.980
You must have worked on a Ph.D. for a while then. 
According to my notes, your master's degree is

04:20.000 --> 04:23.625
1955. Well, I finished the work then, but I 
didn't... What happened is that the university at

04:29.221 --> 04:34.566
the time had an extensive contract with this 
center. At this time, it was the Bureau of

04:34.626 --> 04:36.968
Commercial Fisheries. And I worked on that, and I 
was interested in it. So I didn't finish the degree

04:39.691 --> 04:44.575
work for the master's degree. I didn't go through 
the formalities of obtaining it and got involved

04:44.675 --> 04:50.781
in an extensive ocean program here. And the degree 
made very little difference to the people here.

04:53.844 --> 04:56.967
But when I wanted to go on to get the PhD, People 
insisted that I clear up the master's degree, so I

04:57.318 --> 05:00.882
did. And so I've been here directly from the 
University of Washington since 57. But I studied

05:08.472 --> 05:11.996
at the university and at Oregon State University. 
Right. Your PhD is from Oregon State. Yes. I'm sort

05:15.501 --> 05:23.250
of intrigued about the close relationship 
between physical oceanography, meteorology,

05:15.501 --> 05:23.250
and marine biology that you put together. Was 
there any particular reason for that? Yes,

05:25.453 --> 05:27.055
because... All of my training in the Navy and the 
submarines was more of a physical nature, not a

05:28.013 --> 05:33.559
biological nature. And I wasn't specifically 
interested in the unique, finite studies of

05:34.200 --> 05:40.246
biology. But having come from the center and 
realizing I was coming back from the center in my

05:40.587 --> 05:48.135
third option, I took marine biology. Because in 
the period I was here, I felt, and this decision was

05:48.595 --> 05:57.565
made before I came here, that I was interested in in 
what you would call today's sort of ecosystem

05:57.815 --> 06:01.479
approach. It was the total study of a segment of the 
ocean, large or small, not the individual study of

06:01.519 --> 06:08.126
any one discipline. So that's why the two came 
together. The physical oceanography and the

06:12.251 --> 06:16.796
meteorology were extensions of my other previous 
studies. And the biology came from the center

06:16.936 --> 06:20.460
here, the interest in it. And so you would suggest 
then that your interest in marine biology then

06:22.041 --> 06:27.147
develops after you or Ole Miss jobs for practical 
interest increasing. What did you first do when

06:30.502 --> 06:33.408
you went to work here? Well, I came here right in 
charge of the oceanography program. They didn't

06:37.295 --> 06:41.223
have any field studies here. The center was 
established as an exploratory fishing base that

06:41.663 --> 06:49.438
had a fishing vessel and a fishing class that just 
went fishing. And they had what we called at that

06:50.330 --> 06:55.015
time a biological laboratory, which did 
research. But it was primarily research on salmon

06:55.195 --> 07:01.041
in the streams, the Columbia River and in the 
Alaskan streams. It did not have what you'd call an

07:01.061 --> 07:05.406
ocean research program. And so in 1953, which was 
while I was studying, the International North

07:06.367 --> 07:19.881
Pacific Fisheries Commission was formed, which 
was a transocean study of the distribution and

07:06.367 --> 07:19.881
movement of salmon. And in order to study this, 
then we developed here at the center an

07:20.603 --> 07:39.767
operational program to catch salmon at sea and to 
make the environmental measurements that tried

07:20.603 --> 07:39.767
to assess what it was in the sea that may be guiding 
the movements of the salmon. So

07:39.787 --> 07:49.699
as I said, I worked on this program at the 
university for a year. and the contract of the

07:49.932 --> 07:53.878
university was referred back to the laboratory. 
The laboratory established the staff, and I

07:53.898 --> 07:56.702
headed it up. So I've been the head of the first and 
the only oceanographic program here since the

07:56.742 --> 08:06.115
center started. What direction have you tried to 
take your program? I realize it would be largely

08:10.381 --> 08:17.171
practical because that's what oceanography is 
about in terms of government. What else did you do?

08:17.852 --> 08:19.534
What did you have in mind doing, constructing? 
Well, I think there are really three phases. At

08:22.156 --> 08:25.340
that time, we knew very little about the North 
Pacific Ocean. There were very few cruises that

08:25.380 --> 08:29.525
had been conducted. The University of Washington 
had just the year before entered out into the

08:29.545 --> 08:34.290
ocean. They were mainly a Puget Sound study. Wayne 
Bird hadn't started his program at Oregon State at

08:37.654 --> 08:41.057
that time. There was no program at the University 
of Alaska. We were basically the only group. This

08:45.805 --> 08:49.349
was a tri-nation treaty, Canada, Japan, the 
United States. And so between the three of us, the

08:49.510 --> 09:03.627
three groups, we kind of split the northern North 
Pacific Ocean into three areas, the western part

08:49.510 --> 09:03.627
by the Japanese, the central part, which we took 
over, and the eastern part in the Gulf of Alaska by

08:49.510 --> 09:03.627
the Canadian group under Dr. Tully. And our first 
attempt was really to just define what was the

09:04.589 --> 09:11.237
steady state, what were the mean conditions over a 
year's time. And having put in the pieces and were

09:14.999 --> 09:24.487
able to show the continuity of the ocean from the 
western side to the eastern at subsurface levels.

09:25.108 --> 09:29.852
There had always been charts of temperature, 
surface temperature, surface salinity. The

09:29.872 --> 09:31.753
observations of depth were not there. There were a 
number of questions that we couldn't answer. And

09:34.475 --> 09:37.798
having defined that, then we looked at the annual 
time changes. And at that point, we started

09:37.918 --> 09:42.362
relating them to the distribution of movements in 
Sandman. And we were quite successful, I think, in

09:42.382 --> 09:44.584
that. And we've gone from that into

09:45.408 --> 09:52.315
what you might call a historical study. We were so 
caught up with the individual cruises and

09:52.515 --> 10:02.866
processing the data from individual cruises, we 
really didn't look at the ocean as an entity. And

10:02.886 --> 10:15.178
having gone back and looked at 10, 20, or 30 years 
where the data we find long-term changes that were

10:02.886 --> 10:15.178
masked by our individual yearly cruises, And so 
we've gone from that point into really a model

10:15.800 --> 10:20.928
study. Now we're in numerical models of the whole 
system, how the wind stress affects the flow and

10:21.008 --> 10:37.953
how this affects the deeper layers and what years 
there were unusual stresses in certain areas that

10:21.008 --> 10:37.953
would divert systems that we assume that the fish 
in the ocean have followed. So it's kind of a

10:38.274 --> 10:41.959
complete study all the way through from just basic 
Observations to monitoring to investigation to

10:43.306 --> 10:51.082
numerical models, which is where we are now. And I 
assume you'll stay with that a while. What do you

10:54.389 --> 10:57.716
propose for the immediate future? At the present 
time, we're involved in two. areas. One is

11:02.653 --> 11:14.568
numerical models that permit us to see in terms of 
one month to several months ahead what the

11:02.653 --> 11:14.568
conditions will be in the ocean, and we hope to 
relate that to fishing strategy. And the other is

11:15.610 --> 11:21.037
what I really had in mind when I came here, and 
that's ecosystems models. In this, we are

11:22.518 --> 11:29.968
handling the coastal zone, the shallow shelf of 
the eastern Bering Sea, although it's 500

11:30.758 --> 11:33.482
kilometers wide and around the Gulf. And this is 
the interactions of the various components,

11:33.542 --> 11:44.597
marine components in the system, and how they 
react to changes in the environment. So it's sort

11:44.657 --> 11:46.940
of a physical and a biological. So you see, I'm 
still right in my niche here. Now, I have a series of

11:51.126 --> 11:58.656
specific questions I'd like to ask you to comment 
on, if you could, or would, really. And primarily,

11:59.885 --> 12:02.409
they concern your work. And these questions are 
primarily designed to help probably explain

12:02.429 --> 12:09.661
further what you're doing. How accurate are we in 
the stage of using physical circulation data in

12:10.482 --> 12:22.781
describing the distribution of marine fisheries 
such as salmon?

12:22.801 --> 12:25.065
Well, I don't know. when you say accuracy i think we 
have shown that the area in which salmon are found

12:25.467 --> 12:49.399
in the oceans are bounded by physical processes or 
physical physical chemical boundaries as we see

12:25.467 --> 12:49.399
them uh fronts so to speak and uh we see areas in 
which uh The separation of salmon that will return

12:50.392 --> 13:00.185
to Asia and salmon that will return to North 
America follow these boundaries or these

12:50.392 --> 13:00.185
systems. But a great deal more work has to be done in 
this regard because there still is the feeling by

13:00.205 --> 13:15.946
the biologists that there is an extensive 
intermingling that it's very difficult to make

13:00.205 --> 13:15.946
any sense out of at this time because of the limited 
observations you have. Perhaps I can clarify that

13:16.687 --> 13:18.490
a little more. My feeling is that Most of the salmon 
fishing is done at night, and this is the time in

13:20.345 --> 13:25.110
which salmon come to the surface. And if you take 
this catch and identify the salmon from

13:26.431 --> 13:41.747
heuristics or morphological characteristics or 
serological characteristics, you're able to

13:26.431 --> 13:41.747
show that this is, at times, a mixture of Asian and 
North American. This is usually at the boundaries

13:41.767 --> 13:45.791
of these fronts. And so the biologist is quick to 
assume that this indicates mixing and therefore a

13:49.505 --> 13:51.807
random distribution. My feeling is that there is a 
separation in strata, whereas although they're

13:52.027 --> 14:06.040
at the surface at night feeding and we catch them at 
night at gill nets, that during the daytime and as

13:52.027 --> 14:06.040
they move, that they move as discrete units and 
they can be separated. So it's our fishing method

14:06.560 --> 14:17.070
of capture that I think prevents us from this 
unique separation that I sincerely believe

14:06.560 --> 14:17.070
exists in the ocean. Well, in a way, you're 
Anticipating my next question.

14:24.763 --> 14:29.029
Modeling, particularly marine productive 
models and biological modeling. If I may say so,

14:29.971 --> 14:34.217
sort of the end thing now for marine biologists to 
do. How accurate are they, and how satisfied are

14:34.437 --> 14:38.463
you with them? Well, at this time, of course, this 
is a very controversial area, but I can answer your

14:40.225 --> 14:46.174
question very directly if If you took a group of 
people, there are those people who feel that man is

14:46.373 --> 14:56.727
never going to be able to model nature to the other 
people that feel that man can do it very capably.

14:59.230 --> 15:13.790
There are still people that are so confused as to 
how to model, say, primary production, which is

14:59.230 --> 15:13.790
just the plant production, and their inability 
really to see all the facets of that, that they

14:59.230 --> 15:13.790
can't see how that you can go on to the next step. But 
I think that we here at the Center have made great

15:17.997 --> 15:32.414
strides for several reasons, one of which we have 
limited our present study to the eastern Bering

15:17.997 --> 15:32.414
Sea shelf, which is not a huge oceanic area having 
tremendous depth. It's rather a closed system. As

15:33.975 --> 15:38.561
you can see, it's bounded by the Alaskan Peninsula 
and bounded by the Asian continent. So you really

15:39.382 --> 15:41.724
can treat that as an ecosystem. And I think this is 
rather unique. Now, what we have done is not to

15:46.887 --> 15:51.533
start with primary production, where most 
modelists do. And they base it that you can't have

15:51.614 --> 15:56.120
the next level unless you have a certain amount. 
There's usually an order of magnitude decrease as

15:56.180 --> 16:01.087
you go up the food web or food chain. But we have 
started right with the fish and found out what it is

16:01.928 --> 16:16.708
that they require to eat and the amounts and what 
the amounts of forage that what they're eating

16:01.928 --> 16:16.708
require. and built an ecosystem that way, and we 
think it's quite remarkable. What we have done is

16:22.119 --> 16:33.851
taken eight components, two fish, two mammals, 
two birds, and two forms of plankton that interact

16:22.119 --> 16:33.851
and are the dominant forms in their area. In some 
cases, they represent 90% of a specific biomass.

16:38.536 --> 16:40.177
The fish, for instance, is pollock. Pollock 
constitutes 90% of the biomass in the eastern

16:40.197 --> 16:43.821
Bering Sea. These are eaten by seals. euphosids at 
some times and they're cannibalistic at other

16:48.245 --> 16:52.051
times. And you get a balance this way. You get 
tremendous insight into the ecosystem of the

16:53.914 --> 16:58.481
area. And I'll just point out two things because I 
could talk for several hours on that. The two

17:02.207 --> 17:08.997
things are that we find that a low percentage of the 
phytoplankton is really consumed in the eastern

17:02.207 --> 17:08.997
Bering Sea. It's not limiting. Probably only 30% 
is utilized by the the planktonic forms that are

17:13.253 --> 17:15.818
forage organisms. The rest just drops to the 
bottom and is assumed by the benthos. So right

17:18.844 --> 17:23.293
away, somebody dealing with the primary 
production model is off base. And the other thing

17:24.515 --> 17:35.076
is that we're finding interactions

17:24.515 --> 17:35.076
of the juvenile fish are very significant. And 
this is an area that no one studies. The

17:37.885 --> 17:43.312
oceanographers will study phytoplankton, 
zooplankton, and sometimes ichthyoplankton by

17:37.885 --> 17:43.312
itself. And we, as a center, study only the 
commercial phase with great big huge nets. And

17:48.459 --> 17:58.212
what we're finding is the bulk of the biomass is in 
the juvenile fish who are eaten and being eaten in a

17:48.459 --> 17:58.212
tremendous cannibalistic and

18:00.385 --> 18:09.816
Sort of a sequence of events, and we're finding out 
that indeed starvation must play a very important

18:00.385 --> 18:09.816
role in the whole system there. No one has ever put 
their hand on before because they just drop out,

18:09.856 --> 18:17.125
fall to the bottom, and nobody really catches 
them. You mean the fish starvation? Yes,

18:19.268 --> 18:21.070
starvation of the fish themselves. There are 
areas and times where they just can't do that,

18:21.090 --> 18:27.658
can't find enough forage to survive. So what we've 
done is this is a lot of this preliminary modeling

18:28.280 --> 18:37.016
has been done by Tyler here, who works with me. And 
so what we have is these eight components, and we

18:37.036 --> 18:49.039
follow them through a year cycle, filling in gaps 
where the data are not available, and balance the

18:37.036 --> 18:49.039
system out. And we've been able to balance it out 
for five years. And since the mammals don't get

18:52.413 --> 19:01.694
tremendously fat or the fish don't die out, we're 
looking for an equilibrium that all of these

18:52.413 --> 19:01.694
things can interact. And in that sense, I think 
this is Just a tremendous asset to the center that

19:05.557 --> 19:08.780
we're just exploiting. I think it's absolutely 
necessary that in fisheries management and

19:08.861 --> 19:17.630
understanding the ecosystem of the eastern 
Bering Sea that people understand these things.

19:17.770 --> 19:26.820
And we are astonishing people on a month-to-month 
basis as things that invariably people say, well,

19:17.770 --> 19:26.820
you know, I always thought that was true, but I 
never knew how to approach it. So my answer is that

19:27.661 --> 19:32.526
if man is ever able to, duplicate nature, which I 
think will be difficult. I think this is one of the

19:37.333 --> 19:46.986
routes to go in the bulk sense that tremendous new 
bits of information are becoming available. We

19:47.086 --> 19:55.398
have just increased the model from eight 
components to 25 components in the sense to work in

19:47.086 --> 19:55.398
the benthos, and the model becomes very 
complicated at that point. And whether we can deal

19:58.645 --> 20:02.048
with the sensitivity of so many interactions. 
That's what we're looking at right now. So I am a

20:04.610 --> 20:14.159
strong advocate of this approach, and I think it's 
working tremendously well in the eastern . Quite

20:14.179 --> 20:14.759
clear. No one can complain about that. What sort of 
experience have you done with drift models in

20:18.683 --> 20:24.868
terms of tracing currents? We've done a 
considerable amount of work. in fact probably

20:28.987 --> 20:54.927
four or five years worth of work off the washington 
coast and in the aleutian area and we have actually

20:28.987 --> 20:54.927
done some bottom drifter work in the kodiak island 
area and these of course have tremendous

20:28.987 --> 20:54.927
limitations but i still think it's a useful it's a 
useful exercise and an inexpensive one provided

20:28.987 --> 20:54.927
you don't release literally tens of thousands of 
these things because they're being accused of

20:55.430 --> 21:01.256
being polluted. Pollution objects, glass 
drifting on the beaches, are plastic cards that

21:02.097 --> 21:07.583
are not biodegradable. I think when you're 
studying an area that you don't know where the

21:09.305 --> 21:15.311
circulation is, that they're invaluable. And I 
think if you're looking at a small area, that is

21:20.101 --> 21:25.070
bounded where you can expect people to return the 
cards, it's unusually valuable. But I'm not an

21:25.351 --> 21:30.621
advocate of people that just do it because they 
hope something will happen. What I'm saying is

21:30.661 --> 21:34.669
that you have to... I think what I'm saying is that 
most of the exploratory work in drift object has

21:38.326 --> 21:45.473
been done, and there's very little sense to do any 
more unless you have a very finite project that

21:38.326 --> 21:45.473
wants to find out a single answer. If I release 
something here at a given time, will it come here in

21:45.533 --> 21:50.217
Vancouver Island or here? But just the huge 
releases, there's no need for those anymore in our

21:50.318 --> 21:54.702
area. So I would say, yes, we used it, used it 
effectively, and except for very specific

21:56.223 --> 22:04.291
projects, we have passed out of that phase. Is 
there any alternative, by the way, to drift

22:05.192 --> 22:07.354
models? Well, of course, it's the only thing that 
people can say really positive about drift

22:08.836 --> 22:16.563
bottles is that they're cheap. And, of course, the 
immediate solution and one that has worked out

22:16.923 --> 22:23.229
very well is satellite tracking of buoys. And we 
were the first to get involved in this in the

22:24.530 --> 22:27.653
Pacific Ocean. We have a paper for a transponding 
buoy in the Pacific Ocean. We were the first group,

22:32.077 --> 22:38.083
I was, to get a frequency allocated for it. 
telemetry buoy work. And the information is just,

22:40.686 --> 22:57.322
well, as they say in Washington, D.C., or did a few 
years ago, mind-boggling, because what we're

22:40.686 --> 22:57.322
seeing is the tremendous complexities of eddies 
that are part of the general circulation system.

22:57.902 --> 23:06.450
And we have to point out very quickly that our 
satellite track buoy program didn't get off the

22:57.902 --> 23:06.450
ground because at the time we had the buoys The buoy 
project was transferred to Bay St. Louis under the

23:07.477 --> 23:12.163
Coast Guard. And all funds in the fishery service 
dried up for these expensive buoys. And so we ended

23:17.250 --> 23:19.153
up with them in the barn. We gave everybody our 
technology. We worked with NASA and had them

23:21.256 --> 23:25.141
tracked with NASA groups in the Bering Sea. And so 
we don't have any, well, the first experiment we

23:26.403 --> 23:32.992
had, we released buoys right off the coast. This is 
an interesting part of the oceanography of the

23:33.432 --> 23:36.977
Pacific Ocean. is that anybody will tell you that 
the Eastwood flow across the Pacific diverges off

23:37.480 --> 23:48.992
the Washington coast, but nobody can give you an 
explanation or a physical basis for this. In other

23:49.072 --> 23:55.378
words, does it diverge at 40 in the winter and 50 in 
the summer, or does it fluctuate back and forth?

23:56.239 --> 24:00.663
Nobody can tell you that, and we're only going to 
find it out by drifting buoy experiments. But our

24:01.904 --> 24:05.428
buoy program,

24:06.674 --> 24:14.364
was just an isolated number

24:06.674 --> 24:14.364
of experiments that I really... I'm not going to 
take your time to go into, but I would say the recent

24:14.384 --> 24:25.118
ones that are done by the OXIEP, this is the Outer 
Continental Shelf Environmental Program, have

24:14.384 --> 24:25.118
been very fantastic. They have found buoys 
drifting in the northern Gulf of Alaska where the

24:25.218 --> 24:33.348
research is concentrated because that's where 
they're drilling the oil. They have found buoys

24:33.448 --> 24:36.512
that will... perform three and four orbits of 
non-tidal period around some of the lees of these

24:38.045 --> 24:47.754
islands in the Gulf. And I'm talking of something 
that will occur over 25 or 30 days. This provides a

24:52.758 --> 24:58.804
tremendous concentrating or resting mechanism 
for migrating salmon and anything else you want.

24:59.584 --> 25:03.388
No one has ever even imagined that this sort of 
thing would happen. So I would say the solution is

25:05.390 --> 25:08.052
the the tracking buoys, that we should do more of 
them as soon as we can. And I think the results of the

25:13.280 --> 25:20.967
ones that have been accomplished by the OXIEP 
group. Actually, it's interesting. Let me just

25:22.709 --> 25:24.491
give you a sideline here. I told you that we 
developed the buoy and had them here in the

25:24.711 --> 25:29.015
mid-1960s. When OXIEP wanted to deal with 
drifting buoys here, they had to go to Don Hanson at

25:29.676 --> 25:34.661
Miami. He's at the AOML lab. And he's the one now 
that's doing satellite track buoy experiments in

25:38.913 --> 25:43.297
the Gulf of Alaska for the oil company. And yet, if 
we had been able to continue with our program 10

25:43.357 --> 25:49.023
years ago, we probably would be doing it. He has to 
fly up or send his people all the way across the

25:49.043 --> 25:57.171
country to do these experiments, because he's the 
only one that has experience with the buoys now. So

25:58.292 --> 26:08.042
that's one of the many things that kind of slipped 
by the wayside, because fisheries have been

25:58.292 --> 26:08.042
really reticent to get into an expensive program 
of environmental studies. Well, that's a long

26:08.950 --> 26:12.474
answer for just drift models, but I thought you 
might know that. I know. I need to know that. As a

26:13.334 --> 26:15.397
matter of fact, I had a question down here written 
in. What is a transponding oceanographic buoy?

26:20.902 --> 26:22.604
Because I had no idea what it was. And what was its 
function was my second part.

26:30.452 --> 26:36.358
What else do you think needs to be done in terms of 
this area, oceanographic?

26:40.085 --> 26:44.232
Well, of course, we need a great deal more study. 
And really, we don't need a lot more people coming

26:45.114 --> 26:51.284
with vessels and ships and instrumentation. What 
we need is some real good coordination. And lots of

26:54.810 --> 27:03.966
times, if I get requests from the National Science 
Foundation to review some of these studies in the

26:54.810 --> 27:03.966
Antarctic or some of these other places where Work 
has been going on for a long time. I also find it

27:06.918 --> 27:12.186
necessary to put at the bottom, why don't you do 
some of the studies off your own coast? And of

27:13.267 --> 27:17.754
course, they're considered world 
oceanographers rather than local. And by dealing

27:17.894 --> 27:26.587
with fisheries and by dealing with governmental 
problems, I'm really more concerned about local

27:17.894 --> 27:26.587
problems than world problems. And so what we need 
to do is to pull all of this work together. I would

27:31.394 --> 27:33.717
say that if the United States marine agencies on 
this coast spend upwards of $100 million in marine

27:33.967 --> 27:40.994
science. They have this at their disposal. 
Whether they spend it in the Arctic or the

27:43.097 --> 27:47.241
Antarctic or the Mediterranean Sea, it doesn't 
matter. But it's there. And yet there is no

27:48.563 --> 27:50.845
coordinating group. Fisheries won't coordinate 
it. NOAA doesn't seem to want to coordinate it. The

27:55.009 --> 27:57.212
universities have poor coordination. And a great 
deal of the money is wasted. So what we need is I

28:03.751 --> 28:09.237
really don't want to say a committee because 
everybody abhors committee, but what we need is

28:03.751 --> 28:09.237
coordination. And with coordination, we would be 
able to answer these problems. And I can give you an

28:13.041 --> 28:14.843
example of that. We have excellent evidence that 
there is a northward flow at the shelf edge along

28:14.863 --> 28:24.513
our coast, all the way from California right up 
into the Gulf of Alaska. There have been no

28:26.415 --> 28:28.577
specific measurements. of this. There have been a 
few drift bottle measurements at the surface, a

28:29.685 --> 28:38.477
few trog measurements at the surface, a few 
speculations of geostrophic flow based upon

28:29.685 --> 28:38.477
station data. But this is a very significant flow. 
It could affect fisheries and biology

28:44.285 --> 28:47.950
tremendously. and yet there is no coordinated 
attempt. People at Oregon State will look at it and

28:51.531 --> 28:59.100
then quit, and somebody higher at the University 
of Washington will look at it when they get a

28:51.531 --> 28:59.100
cruise. And this is what I think we're missing in 
fisheries. What we need to know is the integrity of

29:02.764 --> 29:11.273
these systems, because this is what will contain a 
population. The population will stay in the

29:11.333 --> 29:13.836
system and do it. So I could give you a long list of 
things. That is just one. We need to know the

29:17.891 --> 29:20.976
function of the divergence off the coast. There's 
tremendous variability, which we have shown in

29:21.436 --> 29:25.142
our reports. A good example is this cold water that 
comes out of the Otcott Sea just below the depth of

29:26.864 --> 29:32.733
winter turnover. This is about, say, 200 to 300 
meters. There's good evidence that this

29:38.774 --> 29:45.783
Gradually, over a period of five or ten years, 
we'll move into the Gulf of Alaska and intrude

29:38.774 --> 29:45.783
almost onto the shelf. Well, as this water 
intrudes on the shelf of the Gulf of Alaska, it will

29:46.083 --> 29:55.536
change at least the migration paths, if not the 
whole distribution of fauna in that area. And yet,

29:56.237 --> 30:05.929
it's been over ten years since we've had anybody 
that is able to document these conditions at

29:56.237 --> 30:05.929
depth.

30:10.128 --> 30:14.374
What kind of cooperative research have you had 
with Japan, for example? And what's your opinion

30:14.394 --> 30:24.687
of the cooperative research that's being carried 
on, really, in this area of the northern Pacific?

30:24.707 --> 30:29.233
Well, let me say that, of course, the early 
studies, the big A specific study was NORPAC in

30:29.737 --> 30:39.627
1955, in which this was pretty well done by Oscar 
Setti and Roger Abell and Joe Reed at Scripps.

30:39.867 --> 30:43.551
Setti, of course, was a Bureau of Commercial 
Fisheries person. And at that time, they had all

30:44.812 --> 30:53.740
kinds of difficulties with the accuracy of their 
observations and getting them to complete their

30:44.812 --> 30:53.740
work. Then we had EASTROPAC.

30:57.614 --> 31:05.007
Not, let me see, I'm thinking of, well, there was a 
big study in the Western Pacific that was a little

30:57.614 --> 31:05.007
more successful. And I'm trying to get to the point 
where, at the present time, the Japanese have

31:06.950 --> 31:14.904
tried to join most of the American operations. And 
actually, at this time, they have one individual

31:15.005 --> 31:20.314
in Japan that sort of rides herd on each one of our 
major ocean thrust, so to speak. They have someone

31:23.277 --> 31:33.761
that speaks for IDOE, someone that speaks for 
probes, which is the processes and resources of

31:23.277 --> 31:33.761
the Eastern Bering Sea study. And so they have, you 
going to change that? Sure, please do.
