00:03.305 --> 00:04.106
One, two, three. One, two, three. One, two, three. 
Testing. Testing. Three, two, one. Three, two,

00:09.952 --> 00:10.913
one. Testing. Three, two, one. I've already 
tested these, so they're working. This is the 21st

00:16.940 --> 00:19.823
of September. We're in 207. And I have the honor and 
pleasure of chatting with Admiral William W.

00:21.705 --> 00:29.734
Pickavance, Jr. First of all, to introduce 
yourself to anyone who would listen to the tape or

00:30.457 --> 00:41.013
read a transcription, give a biographical 
summary of yourself up until the time you came to

00:30.457 --> 00:41.013
A&M. Okay, I was... What did family do and all that? 
My mom and dad are from Sherman, Texas, and of

00:44.499 --> 00:54.895
course, my dad was in the Air Force during World War 
II, flew B-24s, got out after after the war, the day

00:55.111 --> 01:08.369
I was born, as a matter of fact, 25th of November, 
1945, and went into the hardware business in Fort

00:55.111 --> 01:08.369
Worth, where I was born, and at Carswell, and was 
recalled during the Korean War. So we were in the

01:08.429 --> 01:18.243
military the whole time, had 16 or 17 moves as an Air 
Force brat, lived overseas in England, and so on

01:08.429 --> 01:18.243
and so forth. And... Came back, we were stationed 
in Missouri, where I went to high school, Knob

01:21.048 --> 01:25.774
Noster, Missouri. Started out up in 
Massachusetts, then down to Knob Noster at

01:26.015 --> 01:29.980
Whiteman Air Force Base. And then in 1961, my 
sophomore year, middle of my sophomore year, we

01:30.060 --> 01:42.096
were transferred to Offutt Air Force Base, where 
Dad worked at SAC headquarters there and was

01:30.060 --> 01:42.096
involved, of course, in the Cuban crisis in 1963. I 
graduated in 1964. I can still remember sitting in

01:44.720 --> 01:49.266
my English class when President Kennedy was 
killed and immediately going over to my best

01:49.718 --> 02:03.952
friend's house whose dad was a two-star general at 
the time and sat there and watched all that on TV and

01:49.718 --> 02:03.952
got the exposure of a very high-ranking officer as 
he talked about the ramifications of this and all

01:49.718 --> 02:03.952
the things that would evolve from it. I applied to 
the Naval Academy. When I was eight years old, I

02:06.855 --> 02:10.698
told my mother I'd give a ride on an aircraft 
carrier someday. And it's really funny because

02:12.080 --> 02:19.607
here growing up in the Air Force, my dad being an Air 
Force pilot, I'm not real sure where The Navy came

02:19.874 --> 02:21.357
into it. But I applied to the Naval Academy. I 
didn't get in my first year. I thought I was going to

02:26.065 --> 02:29.151
go play football there, and it didn't work out. So I 
talked to a bunch of folks. And Texas A&M had always

02:31.155 --> 02:36.124
been a school that we talked about in our family for 
years. And my dad was only a major at the time, so he

02:36.224 --> 02:38.929
didn't make a lot of money. And certainly I didn't 
have any academic qualifications. I had some

02:42.095 --> 02:45.158
football qualifications, but not academic 
qualifications. And I knew how to find a date and

02:45.198 --> 02:51.025
that kind of stuff, but I didn't focus on 
academics. As a matter of fact, to get out of high

02:51.065 --> 02:58.493
school, I'll never forget, we had this Spanish 
teacher, big old, big gal, big gal, had a mustache,

02:51.065 --> 02:58.493
I'll never forget it. Her name was Miss Snavely. 
And right before we graduated in 1964 from

03:00.455 --> 03:04.680
Bellevue High School there in Nebraska, I had to, I 
literally went up and kissed her on the cheek and

03:04.998 --> 03:11.288
said, Miss Naval, you can't give me a D. You know, 
they'll never let me in college. So she gave me a C

03:11.308 --> 03:14.092
minus. And I got into A&M. And we came down here. I 
intentionally had planned on using it for prep

03:18.118 --> 03:22.065
school for the Naval Academy. Had you visited A&M 
before? Never have. Never been here. I'd seen all

03:25.911 --> 03:29.717
the pictures, and I loved the military part of it. 
You know, I really, I knew I wanted to be in the

03:30.017 --> 03:33.182
military. And the only thing you didn't have was 
Naval ROTC. And so, and that's kind of how I got into

03:36.377 --> 03:45.527
this Galveston process that I'll talk about here 
in a second, is that we got down here. I was in

03:45.567 --> 03:48.331
Company E2 in Army ROTC. My initial plan was, 
because I really struggled. My uniforms were

03:52.916 --> 03:53.997
pressed. My shoes were shined. But boy, my eyes 
were really open. I just wasn't the, you know, top

03:57.601 --> 04:00.705
notch whatever. And between the, I enjoyed the 
military rigor more than I enjoyed sitting in a

04:01.242 --> 04:09.995
class with 1,000 people, or however many it was. It 
was auditorium, like it was just loaded with

04:10.056 --> 04:12.059
folks. And listen to Phil Graham and others try to 
teach me economics. You know, I just. All right,

04:16.265 --> 04:18.829
now your dad was stationed at? at Offutt at the 
time. So y'all drove down. My grandparents lived

04:21.593 --> 04:24.979
up in Sherman. Thank you for bringing that up. I 
think the money part of it is something we kind of

04:26.582 --> 04:30.790
talked a little bit about it last night. My dad was a 
major. He probably in those days was making a

04:33.514 --> 04:37.001
thousand dollars a month. When I went to school 
here, and we were Texas residents obviously and

04:38.123 --> 04:43.112
had been forever, Still would like to be, except in 
Florida, you got to get a Texas driver's license.

04:45.999 --> 04:49.486
First time in my life I've ever had anything other 
than a Texas driver's license since I moved to

04:45.999 --> 04:49.486
Florida. But at any rate, Dad didn't make a lot of 
money. And I can remember when we moved from

04:53.072 --> 04:58.784
Missouri to Offutt, we literally lived on rice and 
beans. And we were very proud, you know, never

04:59.284 --> 05:03.312
lacked for anything. But you could always tell 
when Mom and Dad were just a tad strapped. And God

05:06.953 --> 05:10.578
bless them, they always pulled it off somehow. But 
you knew it was for a good purpose. So when I decided

05:12.761 --> 05:18.028
to come to school down here, it was quite a, it was 
hard on my parents. But, you know, I think in those

05:18.749 --> 05:27.021
days the tuition was $50 a semester, and it was 
$368, you know, for room and boards. And you

05:27.592 --> 05:32.939
couldn't go anywhere in the world and get that kind 
of an education for that price that I'm aware of.

05:33.680 --> 05:35.622
And so anyway, this is where I came. Got down here. I 
started majoring in history. Just a second. Mom

05:41.190 --> 05:42.271
and dad brought you? Oh, yes, sir. Now let me go to 
that. Mom and dad brought me. What did you bring?

05:45.676 --> 05:46.577
What was the trip like? Well, it was interesting. 
Of course, my dad hadn't been in the Air Force all

05:48.559 --> 05:51.243
these years. We had these military foot lockers. 
And... And Mom had taken all my white towels and my

05:54.929 --> 06:00.918
underwear and my undershirts. And so, I don't know 
how she did it, but these little bitty name tags,

06:01.619 --> 06:12.235
Bill Pickivants, I'll never forget it, little 
tiny things, you know, that were in all my clothes

06:01.619 --> 06:12.235
and all my towels and all this kind of stuff. And 
shoeshine gear. And, of course, they gave you a

06:13.838 --> 06:19.246
little list of kind of your, what we call a sea bag in 
the Navy. It kind of had a list of things that you

06:19.266 --> 06:23.232
need to bring, and then we'll provide the uniforms 
and the other stuff. And it was the dirtiest thing

06:24.022 --> 06:26.866
I've ever seen. They brought me. Of course, they 
were reared in the Depression, and they were

06:29.669 --> 06:33.594
pretty tough folks. And they dropped me off in 
front of the registrar's office and then drove

06:34.335 --> 06:37.780
off. And my grandparents came down, too. We came 
down from Sherman, and they took my footlocker out

06:39.883 --> 06:44.909
of the trunk, put it out in front. There was kind of a 
line, and I can remember everybody signing in. And

06:49.165 --> 06:50.147
I'd gotten a haircut. It wasn't short enough, but 
I'd gotten a haircut. I'd always worn a crew cut.

06:53.412 --> 06:59.963
And I sat on that trunk as they drove off down the 
street. Of course, I don't even think now you can

06:59.983 --> 07:02.607
even drive on that street anymore. But they drove 
off, and I thought, my word, this is it. I'm on my

07:07.495 --> 07:09.058
own. Did your dad give you any, or mom or anybody 
else, any last-minute advice? Well... The usual

07:14.562 --> 07:15.944
things. Son, do the best you can. You know, you've 
got to take advantage of this. Neither one of them

07:20.131 --> 07:21.733
had gone to college. My grandmother, my dad's 
mother, had gone to

07:22.594 --> 07:29.906
Hockaday, I guess it was, in Fort Worth. And she had 
graduated from college. But she was the only one,

07:32.109 --> 07:35.995
and I guess my dad's sister had graduated from 
college. But dad... He hadn't even finished high

07:36.888 --> 07:45.780
school when he went to Fort Sill to get in the 
artillery and then got into cadets and was flying

07:36.888 --> 07:45.780
B-24s. My mother was a tennis player and was a Texas 
tennis champion and they'd gotten married and

07:49.004 --> 07:56.996
they'd eloped just like Nancy and I did 36 years 
ago. But neither one of them had gone to college. So

08:00.702 --> 08:04.568
the advice was take advantage of this and do the 
best you can. We love you. Don't call us when you

08:05.429 --> 08:08.093
need to. And I think, of course, they gave me some 
spending money. I don't think it was very much. And

08:13.562 --> 08:15.304
then off they went. And how did you get from there to 
an outfit. How did, as far as you know? Well, you

08:21.899 --> 08:29.411
know, in those days, I'm trying to remember the, it 
seems to me like you had to walk downstairs where

08:21.899 --> 08:29.411
you signed in and you kind of left your trunk there. 
And then Terry Archer, who was my roommate, and

08:30.072 --> 08:38.245
Terry and I had known each other since we were about 
eight years old at Westover Air Force Base and

08:30.072 --> 08:38.245
other places. Terry and I each, as I recall, we each 
carried our trunks together. And we were official

08:44.877 --> 08:47.681
ladies. What outfit? Company E2, Shoemaker Hall, 
over here. Did it have a nickname? Reveille was our

08:54.510 --> 08:56.312
company. In fact, it's ironic that now that's the 
Navy Marine Corps company, which I find

08:56.453 --> 09:03.182
interesting. But we had Reveille, and I can 
remember whipping out to, Howdy, Ms. Reveille,

09:03.222 --> 09:07.227
ma'am. So we got through all the registration 
stuff and drug our foot lockers down and They went

09:14.105 --> 09:20.397
back and got our uniforms and we had our ironing 
boards and our iron and all that kind of stuff. Our

09:21.058 --> 09:26.629
fan, in fact I was getting dressed last night and I 
said, well I don't remember it being this hot here.

09:26.669 --> 09:30.096
Nancy says, yeah well you were a lot thinner in 
those days. But we put our fan in the window and made

09:30.116 --> 09:35.146
our racks. We knew how to do that and and got 
ourselves squared away. As a matter of fact, since

09:38.384 --> 09:51.109
both of our dads were in the military, Terry's dad 
was also in the military, we sort of knew a lot of

09:38.384 --> 09:51.109
stuff from listening to our dad's talk about going 
through cadets and all that. So we were able to get

09:51.129 --> 09:56.599
our bunks made and get our uniforms ironed and 
cleaned up. And actually, Butch Trish, who was the

09:56.917 --> 10:03.669
company commander, and Arnie Sauge, who was 
the... Spell Sauge. I think it's S-A-L-G-E, from

10:04.751 --> 10:07.696
Seguin. I'll never forget it. And I forget where 
Butch Trish was from, but he's really a nice guy.

10:13.225 --> 10:14.267
Tough, but nice. They kind of used us as examples 
because we knew how to spit shine shoes and all that

10:14.703 --> 10:33.414
and I can remember all the other fish sitting down 
on the side and we were standing up showing how to

10:14.703 --> 10:33.414
put on the brass and all that kind of stuff, get the 
maiden head off and all that and using the

10:14.703 --> 10:33.414
newspaper and Brasso and so that's kind of how it 
all began. Describe then the first few days of how

10:39.492 --> 10:44.526
all of the core activities and the good bull and 
going into the dining hall. Describe that. Well,

10:45.549 --> 10:49.620
we spent, of course, more time studying studying 
all the stuff you had to study to get it to be able to

10:50.208 --> 11:00.258
eat, you know, and going through all the, not being 
informed of the high-score accuracy,

10:50.208 --> 11:00.258
particularly if you're ever going to give you a 
two-course rectitude and short shrub and don't

10:50.208 --> 11:00.258
know the answer. You know, we had to go through all 
that and learn all those things, and the problem

11:00.539 --> 11:10.029
with Terry Archer, who I just love dearly, he's now 
in Florida, and we're just very, very close. We're

11:10.209 --> 11:11.850
just a great guy. He turned out to be a very 
successful contractor, built a lot of buildings

11:12.351 --> 11:19.118
in Houston, and has literally built Naples, 
Florida. But Terry, God bless him, would never

11:19.098 --> 11:24.966
take the time to read the darn menu. So, you know, we 
get in formation, and you didn't want to, I don't

11:25.567 --> 11:32.756
want to cuss, but F word your fish buddy. So I'd have 
the real menu memorized, right? We'd be standing

11:35.620 --> 11:39.705
there at attention, and it'd be eggs all rotten and 
all this kind of stuff. Well, Archer would be

11:39.725 --> 11:44.852
standing there, and they'd come to him and say, 
Fish Archer, what's the menu? Many other days,

11:45.153 --> 11:48.838
he'd rattle off just anything. I mean, anything 
from hamburgers to filet mignon. So here I've got

11:52.703 --> 11:56.008
the real menu, and I've been reciting it over and 
over again. He gives this menu that's completely

11:57.009 --> 12:01.255
false, and then they come to me and they say, what's 
the menu? And I can remember just getting it all. Of

12:05.561 --> 12:07.684
course, here we all are, you know, doing push-ups. 
And everybody was like, pick a piece. You've got to

12:09.226 --> 12:11.329
start learning the menu. And he never got whacked 
for it. It was always me. I was always the guy that

12:17.915 --> 12:20.739
they thought wasn't memorizing the menu. So those 
kinds of things were kind of the first shot. Going

12:22.962 --> 12:36.861
down the steps, in those days we wore the khakis, 
and you couldn't have any wrinkles in the back

12:22.962 --> 12:36.861
where your legs normally bend, so you'd kind of go 
down on the heels of your shoes so you wouldn't bend

12:22.962 --> 12:36.861
them. Making sure your uniform was perfect. I 
think the big one was getting out of your hole in the

12:40.516 --> 12:46.106
morning because you never knew who was in the 
passageway. Generally, Terry would be arcing

12:47.929 --> 12:51.235
around the door. He'd get a little nervous. I'd 
just push him out into the passageway. We came up

12:55.082 --> 12:57.226
with this thing that was something like this. I 
just kind of didn't even make sense, and they never

13:00.652 --> 13:04.364
seemed to notice. So it was really, I thought that 
was kind of interesting. But I used to be able to

13:07.233 --> 13:08.577
remember names. I tell you, here today, I think 
because of that, I don't remember people's names.

13:14.544 --> 13:15.245
It's just amazing. It's almost a psychological 
thing because I had to remember so many of them and

13:15.425 --> 13:21.337
where they were from and what they were taking and 
all that kind of stuff. That first semester, you

13:21.357 --> 13:25.105
were officially majoring in history. Do you 
remember some courses you took that first

13:26.087 --> 13:28.813
semester? I can remember biology. I don't 
remember who the instructor was. And it was the

13:33.440 --> 13:35.062
dirtiest thing. I remember one case in particular 
where we were looking at some plants or something

13:35.202 --> 13:42.631
under the microscope. And they really need 
microscopes over there, you know. And it's the

13:44.814 --> 13:48.559
first time, you know, biology in high school, you 
didn't have these kind of microscopes. But this is

13:48.599 --> 13:51.002
one of these electron kind of microscopes. It 
makes everything look big. And the prof had handed

13:53.104 --> 13:59.011
out some slides that we were supposed to look at and 
draw or something. And I was just, God, I just said,

13:59.051 --> 14:02.856
holy mackerel. And I remember he came over and 
said, what are you talking about here? And I said,

14:07.647 --> 14:08.488
look at that. Look at that thing eating those other 
things down there. And, well, he looked at me and

14:11.191 --> 14:16.177
said, well, obviously you haven't studied 
because that's exactly what you're supposed to be

14:11.191 --> 14:16.177
looking at. You're supposed to be telling me about 
it. And so biology, again, I was not, my academic

14:18.180 --> 14:28.133
prowess was probably not anywhere near what it 
should be or should have been in those days, but I

14:18.180 --> 14:28.133
learned later on. And, of course, economics and 
history and all that other kind of stuff were, The

14:32.722 --> 14:34.285
core was still compulsory. Oh, absolutely. 
Absolutely. Describe a typical day, Monday

14:38.112 --> 14:44.965
through Friday, for you and your outfit. What time 
did you all get up? What happened where? What did

14:47.650 --> 14:48.632
you do when? It seems to me that... Our day started 
six-ish, usually, and we tried to get down to the

14:51.925 --> 15:05.707
showers before the upperclassmen got down there 
so we could run in, get our shower, and get the heck

14:51.925 --> 15:05.707
out and not get zapped. And, of course, get our 
uniforms ironed and get dressed and get our racks

15:05.867 --> 15:19.148
made up and get ourselves in order and get the whole 
in order, closet and all that kind of stuff. And

15:19.651 --> 15:27.022
then they would fall out for formation, I want to 
say probably 7ish, 6.30 or 7ish. And that was when,

15:27.042 --> 15:40.542
of course, for the first, it seems like the first 
three months, we just really got ourselves, every

15:27.042 --> 15:40.542
time we turned around, we were getting hollered at 
and yelled at and all that, the duty stuff. We kind

15:40.642 --> 15:43.987
of took that in stride because we figured that that 
was what was going to happen. And you kind of knew

15:44.027 --> 15:46.010
who the bad players were. There were a couple of 
guys that were, almost sadistic in some of the

15:47.697 --> 15:50.460
stuff they wanted to do. And I think in that kind of 
an environment, you will occasionally find that

15:50.520 --> 15:58.129
people, there's some folks who really like to do 
hazing. And I discovered after, I discovered

15:58.569 --> 16:07.680
through the years that they're usually folks that 
probably didn't have it very hard when they went

15:58.569 --> 16:07.680
through it. Particularly, the little guys 
particularly like picking on myself and Terry,

16:07.700 --> 16:13.266
making us be slaves, if you will. But then we'd fall 
out for formation. And, let's see, you all went to

16:16.408 --> 16:18.590
Sabisa. We went to Sabisa. Duncan. Oh, you're a 
Duncan. Duncan. And we'd fall out and, you know,

16:23.236 --> 16:27.601
we'd have the, I really liked this part of it. It'd 
be early in the morning, be crisp, and, you know,

16:27.621 --> 16:39.896
and, you know, everybody would be very formal and 
add attention and report, you know, and go around

16:27.621 --> 16:39.896
the, you know, the whole, the whole Corps there. 
Then the Corps commander and his staff would march

16:39.936 --> 16:43.320
in and then, You know, we'd all fall in, and we did 
that for all three meals my freshman year. And so

16:50.468 --> 17:00.241
you'd go in, go in for breakfast, and if you're 
sitting on the hot, you know, running the hot

16:50.468 --> 17:00.241
table, you were, you know, the corner there, you 
were a busy fella. And needless to say, Terry and I

17:00.922 --> 17:10.776
didn't get a lot to eat in those days and stayed 
pretty thin throughout that first year. Do you

17:10.992 --> 17:15.299
remember some foods that you really liked and or 
really didn't like? I loved the potatoes au

17:16.260 --> 17:18.404
gratin. I loved the spaghetti because if you ate 
spaghetti, you could get the meat and everything

17:19.045 --> 17:26.196
kind of all in one bite before somebody yelled at 
you. I thought the apple pies were just out of this

17:26.977 --> 17:30.203
world. In fact, one day, a bunch of us freshmen 
decided, a bunch of fish decided that we were going

17:32.120 --> 17:36.508
to get a pie. So we took our, and it had to wait for a 
day when it was raining where you had your

17:36.548 --> 17:41.077
raincoats and piss pots. And you could, you know, a 
helmet would fit right over a pie. So, and you

17:44.724 --> 17:47.268
walked out with your helmet to your side. So you 
could literally put a pie up in your helmet and try

17:47.289 --> 17:51.737
to walk out with it. Now, if you got caught, it was 
the last time you were going to see daylight. But we

17:55.557 --> 17:59.181
actually, some of us actually managed to get out 
with it, you know. And, boy, we devoured it because

17:59.682 --> 18:03.306
if they found it, and then what do you do with the 
pan? I mean, it was a regular military operation. I

18:06.591 --> 18:10.756
mean, there was a lot of stuff you had to do to make 
that all work, you know, come off right. Back to the

18:11.437 --> 18:12.859
dorm, then go to class. Back to the dorm, go to 
class. Class was kind of a reprieve. And, of

18:17.765 --> 18:23.372
course, the Memorial Student Center was our place 
to really – go sleep, because you really didn't get

18:23.977 --> 18:26.261
much sleep. You know, you could be sleeping, and 
the next thing you know, they'd be banging on your

18:26.481 --> 18:41.909
door, and you'd be in there with your helmet, piss 
pot, and raincoat on, and smoking cigarettes to

18:26.481 --> 18:41.909
get the place real smoky with the windows shut, 
and, you know, it was, you know, you learn to live

18:26.481 --> 18:41.909
with stress, you know. I don't think that at that 
point in time that we were, and in retrospect, we

18:42.850 --> 18:48.280
weren't pushing academics as hard as we should 
have been. And I'm glad to see that Ted Hopgood and

18:50.738 --> 18:58.145
others are doing that because that's really the 
strategic objective. And that was not as

18:58.245 --> 19:03.269
critical, it didn't seem to me like, as some of the 
other stuff that's going on. But the other stuff

19:03.289 --> 19:05.411
was really kind of fun and challenging. And give me 
68 and one for the Corps and one for the president

19:05.451 --> 19:10.235
and one for this and one for that. So you end up doing 
100 push-ups. And literally, you just kind of

19:11.797 --> 19:16.461
rolled into the rack and you were just beat. But 
going to class was sort of a reprieve from all that.

19:19.680 --> 19:26.649
But I can remember being really tired and probably 
not taking as copious notes as I should. In fact, it

19:26.669 --> 19:36.882
was right in this building, in the older part of the 
building, where we had our Spanish class. And

19:37.583 --> 19:40.767
again, I told you Spanish is not my forte, but you 
had to take it. And I thought, well, I'll take

19:40.788 --> 19:42.229
Spanish again. Well, it wasn't Spanish like It 
wasn't being taught the way I was kind of used to.

19:48.436 --> 19:50.110
You'd go in, you'd sit in a cube, and this retired 
Air Force colonel, I can't remember his name,

19:50.512 --> 20:16.587
would give you a tape, or he put the tape in, that's 
what it was, and then he dialogued through a

19:50.512 --> 20:16.587
machine, and that was kind of foreign to me, and 
unless you really spent some time studying, it was

19:50.512 --> 20:16.587
sometimes hard to understand because the tapes 
weren't good, so I was always trying to listen and

19:50.512 --> 20:16.587
go on to the next thing, so I had a tough time with 
Spanish, so I had to They had to retake Spanish and

20:16.820 --> 20:20.784
finally made an A in it, but subsequently. And 
midday, you'd go back to your room. Midday, you

20:23.186 --> 20:25.148
went back, and I can't remember the time. Did you 
all fall in? Oh, yeah, absolutely, absolutely.

20:27.570 --> 20:32.976
And this is when Terry Archer would come up with 
these culinary menus that would just drive us all

20:27.570 --> 20:32.976
crazy. Then we'd march in, eat, go back, and, of 
course, now it's 1230 or so, and now you're really

20:32.996 --> 20:39.702
tired and sleepy. And, of course, you had to walk 
over, and you'd have this big, auditorium full of

20:43.178 --> 20:59.888
people and sit there and try to stay awake and take 
notes and take tests and then you'd go back after

20:43.178 --> 20:59.888
that, get your uniforms pressed for the evening 
formation and go eat and then come back and study

20:43.178 --> 20:59.888
and get interrupted occasionally, frequently. 
and then try to get to bed. I think at 10.30 is when

21:02.036 --> 21:21.066
taps hit, or 10, and we'd go to bed, and sometimes if 
you had a test the next day, you'd study with your

21:02.036 --> 21:21.066
flashlight under your sheets, and we'd try to fix 
our doors where we still got a breeze because it was

21:02.036 --> 21:21.066
hot and there was no air conditioning and that kind 
of stuff. in the chow hall. Did you all have cush

21:23.251 --> 21:24.673
questions? Oh, absolutely. Oh, absolutely. What 
were some of your favorites you remember? Well,

21:28.317 --> 21:42.872
you know, of course we were quizzed on every 
building, brick, tree, tradition, you know,

21:28.317 --> 21:42.872
known to mankind, and it's the duty, the duty ones 
that we all study, and yeah, they kept us busy. I can

21:42.912 --> 21:49.939
remember people crawling around on the tables and 
lighting the napkins, you know, and as a matter of

21:42.912 --> 21:49.939
fact, my When I commanded an air wing, F-18 air 
wing, a fellow by the name of Bob Maddox, who

21:50.425 --> 22:04.143
graduated in 69 or 70, Marine, Lieutenant Colonel 
was my executive officer, and another fellow by

21:50.425 --> 22:04.143
the name of Dizzy Dean was an Aggie, and he was in the 
squadron. He was one of my instructors, F-18

22:04.163 --> 22:07.868
instructor pilots, a Marine. And Bob Maddox's 
going away party, he did that same thing. I hadn't

22:12.934 --> 22:19.723
seen it since I was in school, and here it was, 1986, 
and all of a sudden, you see these flames coming up

22:12.934 --> 22:19.723
from these napkins, and... What had happened is 
that Maddox used to be one of Dizzy's, I guess,

22:20.159 --> 22:26.093
upperclassmen and said, Dean, get over here. Dean 
said, get around here and light those napkins.

22:31.425 --> 22:33.730
Everybody was just, what are these guys doing? 
There was a lot of that kind of stuff that went on all

22:33.951 --> 22:36.136
the time. I just... Like I said, I remember tasting 
some stuff, but I don't ever remember walking out

22:37.709 --> 22:43.656
of there where I felt like I was really full. Most of 
the time, freshmen all came over to the Memorial

22:43.676 --> 22:51.905
Student Center and tried to get something to eat 
there because you knew you weren't going to get

22:43.676 --> 22:51.905
much to eat at the chow hall. Now, there was no 
hazing or anything like that in the library? No. Or

22:57.952 --> 22:59.394
the MSC? That's right. Of course, they didn't drop 
handles, but you could go curl up in a corner there

23:00.155 --> 23:06.602
and... I mean, that was a real sanctuary. And a 
couple of times, and I remember what we did. I'm

23:11.908 --> 23:14.892
sure it had to do with Babbo bombs or something. You 
know, we kind of, our company sort of split up into

23:15.072 --> 23:20.559
what we called the big ones and the little ones. And 
we didn't, we wanted to all be the same, but we had

23:20.899 --> 23:25.445
some folks that didn't want to cause any trouble. 
You know, let's maintain status quo and, you know,

23:25.485 --> 23:31.392
we'll get through this and get on and be 
sophomores, you know, pissheads. And there was

23:31.372 --> 23:35.576
others who said, bullshit, let's take these guys 
on. We're smart as they are. So, you know, excuse my

23:37.097 --> 23:40.700
English, but there came that when the Babel bomb 
started coming and all that. So it wasn't too long

23:40.720 --> 23:48.827
into the semester that, as I recall, we lost our MSC 
privileges except for our mailbox, because

23:40.720 --> 23:48.827
that's where our mailboxes were. Because of some 
of the annex we were doing. And, you know, it was,

23:51.489 --> 23:56.373
but I can't remember all of it. It seems to me like 
Babel bombs were one, and then, oh, I can remember,

24:01.105 --> 24:14.912
upperclassmen had a tendency, you know, you'd get 
a care box from home, and my mother, for some

24:01.105 --> 24:14.912
reason, liked Divinity Candy, so she thought I 
did, and I can't stand it. But Trish loved, my

24:15.331 --> 24:18.856
company commander, loved Divinity Candy. And so 
these guys would all wander in and eat all this

24:18.976 --> 24:21.058
candy. Well, it didn't really matter because I 
didn't like it anyway, but I thought that was sort

24:21.078 --> 24:25.044
of rude. So I can remember getting this box, and we 
kind of advertised it, and then we took shaving

24:25.584 --> 24:36.118
cream and put shaving cream on top of all these 
little... Oh, man, I forget what we lost that time.

24:36.178 --> 24:39.803
Probably our toilet, not the seat privileges. We 
had to sit down on the hard part and... So we caused

24:44.373 --> 24:46.115
some problems. Of course, in those days, getting 
hit with a broom was great. Bend over and grab pooch

24:52.002 --> 24:54.224
and get whacked with a broom. That was nothing. 
That was wonderful compared to the coat hangers.

24:58.589 --> 25:02.494
The coat hanger one was the one that really got us. I 
can remember going into the showers and soaking

25:02.534 --> 25:10.523
the khakis off my rear end because of the scab 
building up on the pockets and all that. Did they

25:12.645 --> 25:14.127
ever use a paddle? I don't remember a paddle, but 
boy, they sure used the coat hanger. You'd take the

25:19.944 --> 25:25.211
coat hanger and stretch it out and whack it, and 
then the broom part. The broom was great. I didn't

25:25.991 --> 25:26.752
mind that. Push-ups and stuff weren't bad setups. 
Yeah, it doesn't say if you live it, but I thought

25:28.414 --> 25:35.423
the coat hanger was a little bit... And in 
retaliation, you guys never put an animal in

25:28.414 --> 25:35.423
anybody's... Never put an animal in anybody's 
room or anything like that? No, we didn't do any of

25:38.010 --> 25:39.091
that. Now, I will tell you, I told you Miss Reveille 
was our mascot, and, of course, we had to take her

25:39.151 --> 25:50.746
out, and she had to go to the bathroom and stuff, and 
it wasn't all that unusual to find a little bit of

25:39.151 --> 25:50.746
that in a babble bomb when it went off.

25:54.631 --> 25:57.315
Now, where was Reveille's room compared to yours? 
Goodness, let's see. I was on, as I recall, we had

25:59.557 --> 26:05.545
the second and third, or the... third and fourth 
decks, as I recall, or floors, and I want to say she

26:06.233 --> 26:13.865
was down on the third. She was down on the third. And 
we had a sophomore, you know, that was her, I'm sure

26:16.429 --> 26:22.218
her piss head was still the, you know, takes care of 
the mascot. And that was a great honor, wasn't it?

26:23.660 --> 26:24.221
Oh, absolutely. In fact, it was a great honor to be 
in Rebel E. I mean, we were all very proud, and...

26:29.420 --> 26:36.488
And we were proud that that we were, we felt tougher 
than the rest, we felt like we were sort of special

26:29.420 --> 26:36.488
that we're kind of handpicked to be in that 
company. And we guard her with with our lives,

26:36.548 --> 26:48.821
literally, I mean, when we went to football games, 
remember, I think it was a TCU game, some folks came

26:36.548 --> 26:48.821
over and look like they're gonna make a run on on 
Reveille. And I mean, the stands empty, and with

26:48.841 --> 26:55.849
our company, and when something like that 
happened, there wasn't any rank structure. But we

26:56.048 --> 26:57.971
were proud of the way we marched. We were proud of 
the way our leadership acted and displayed

26:58.011 --> 27:05.301
themselves and the presence they had. And that 
just kind of rippled down through the rest of us.

27:10.308 --> 27:16.496
Now, in terms of going to class, what were your own 
personal guidelines about you? Did you go

27:16.516 --> 27:17.478
regularly? Oh, absolutely. Absolutely. The 
Spanish one I sort of dropped because it just got to

27:19.403 --> 27:25.194
where it was starting to interfere with other 
stuff. I was just getting further and further

27:25.214 --> 27:27.178
behind. I was getting frustrated, so I went and 
dropped it. I think I actually dropped it within

27:29.262 --> 27:33.591
the time frame, but it got me some hours behind. I 
took fencing and just loved it. We had an Olympic

27:37.218 --> 27:41.226
class fencing instructor here. I just loved it, 
and I wish that we'd have carried it on, but it's

27:41.678 --> 27:49.748
hard to find somebody else to fence it, so it kind of 
fell by the wayside. I was a show don, a black belt in

27:50.309 --> 28:00.582
judo, so we had a judo club here that was really 
good, and we'd go all over Texas to do judo, so that

27:50.309 --> 28:00.582
was a lot of fun. And in class, did you ever go to 
sleep in class? Oh, absolutely, absolutely. You

28:08.847 --> 28:22.932
tried not to, obviously, out of respect, but 
sometimes you're just so tired that, you know, you

28:08.847 --> 28:22.932
just, and in the smaller classes it wasn't so bad, 
but it was in the big auditoriums and, you know,

28:08.847 --> 28:22.932
where I tended to doze off. And I'd look around. I 
wasn't the only one. And you went to class

28:25.076 --> 28:26.498
regularly, though. Absolutely. Absolutely.

28:30.650 --> 28:31.071
No, I didn't. I don't remember. I don't think that 
was an option. It seemed to me like the company

28:33.114 --> 28:41.166
commander got a list of folks that were not doing 
that, and you would get, you know, that would just

28:33.114 --> 28:41.166
bring more trouble on you. So, yeah. And as that 
first semester is going along, how did you

28:42.228 --> 28:47.756
communicate with mom and dad? By letter, pretty 
much the whole time. About how often? I tried to

28:51.162 --> 28:52.624
write at least once a week. And occasionally on the 
weekends, we had one phone down on the passageway

28:52.958 --> 28:57.865
and we'd call home. But I remember when my 
mid-semester grades came out, I wasn't doing real

28:58.366 --> 29:01.471
hot. And that was about the time, I want to think it 
was way or something was happening, and Dan Rather

29:01.931 --> 29:09.743
was showing pretty severely wounded folks on 
tanks. And I'll never forget my dad saying, son,

29:09.843 --> 29:17.174
unless you knuckle down here, that's what's going 
to happen to you. Now get your act together. And I

29:19.197 --> 29:20.839
did. But that's also about the time that, because 
you recall, I wanted to be in the Navy. That's what I

29:26.124 --> 29:28.967
wanted to do, was fly in the Navy and command an 
aircraft carrier. And that was about the time I

29:29.788 --> 29:35.335
found out about this place called the Texas 
Maritime Academy that was being built. And I loved

29:35.355 --> 29:37.818
going to see. The whole time I was in high school, 
for the summer, I'd write American President

29:37.878 --> 29:47.409
lines and all these different things in National 
Geographic to see if I could just come and just, I'd

29:37.878 --> 29:47.409
work for free. But I just wanted to get on a steamer 
and just go places and see things. So that's when I

29:51.312 --> 29:54.476
got into the Texas Maritime Academy. All right. 
You don't go home until Thanksgiving? No, no. As a

30:00.604 --> 30:03.688
matter of fact, I spent Thanksgiving with my 
grandparents. And that was interesting. Myself

30:06.932 --> 30:12.739
and another guy that lived in Sherman, Texas, I 
wish I could remember his name, left here and drove

30:06.932 --> 30:12.739
to Sherman. And, of course, we had the clubs here 
for the different towns, and that's where I met

30:12.960 --> 30:20.850
him, which was a great idea because some folks had 
cars, others didn't. I wasn't. I wasn't rich

30:21.468 --> 30:23.191
enough to do that. In fact, I had to sell a 52 MGTD 
just to get some other money to help Dad pay for the

30:23.251 --> 30:29.941
school. We spent Thanksgiving with my 
grandparents. I can't remember if my parents

30:36.710 --> 30:44.522
stroked down or not, but I can remember laying on my 
grandmother's couch on Sunday when we had to drive

30:36.710 --> 30:44.522
back. Boy, I tell you, it took all the guts I could 
muster. My buds had been going to other schools, so

30:50.915 --> 30:57.208
I was sort of corresponding with them and Sherman 
around Thanksgiving. They were having fun,

30:57.249 --> 30:59.473
members of fraternities. College was just a 
pinstripe shirt and a pair of penny loafers. It was

31:04.805 --> 31:05.667
just awesome. Boy, they were just having a ball, 
chasing girls and you know, and yada, yada, yada.

31:10.277 --> 31:17.868
The North Texas crowd, the University of Texas 
crowd, and the Baylor bunch, they were all, you

31:10.277 --> 31:17.868
know, just talking about it. And, of course, I 
never let on that this was the way it was because it

31:17.888 --> 31:26.000
was pretty stressful. And I presume some of the 
guys that you knew were dropping out. Oh,

31:29.746 --> 31:30.346
absolutely. I want to say that we lost probably 
35%, 40% of our freshmen that went in. I think that

31:36.035 --> 31:38.218
