WEBVTT

00:03.254 --> 00:05.236
their strong points and their assets. So I began to 
write things for them. And the first March I wrote

00:08.339 --> 00:16.407
for them, Vern was still there, that old men of 
Kyle, which they've been still been playing that

00:08.339 --> 00:16.407
now for 27 years. And they, they, everywhere they 
go, they play it. And so then I could see that since

00:20.531 --> 00:28.519
it was predominantly brass, that the woodwinds 
were just, just filling the hole really. so we

00:29.292 --> 00:56.987
began to really expound on that a lot and really the 
sound became almost unique because uh and the

00:29.292 --> 00:56.987
first i wanted them to go over to the sidelines and 
halt and play right in front of the people so they

00:29.292 --> 00:56.987
could see how good they were well this had never 
been done they did not want to do it but i was

00:29.292 --> 00:56.987
established pretty good by then, and the drum 
major I had, I said, this is the guy that I think we

00:57.440 --> 01:03.711
can do it with. So I wrote a medley of tunes called 
the Blue Gray Medley, which they played up until

01:03.731 --> 01:11.063
just a few years ago. And it had Yellow Rose of 
Texas, and it had the Bonnie Blue Flag. I wrote that

01:19.557 --> 01:23.464
for Travis Bryan, because that's his favorite 
song in this world. and then it had Dixie, which

01:23.444 --> 01:30.634
they let us play, and then it had the Battle Hymn of 
the Republic. And it was just for us and nobody

01:30.654 --> 01:32.816
else. So anyway, I talked to him, and he said, well, 
sir, I'll go. I said, I want you to go talk to the drum

01:35.901 --> 01:41.929
major now and see what they think about it, and then 
I want you to come back and let's all get together

01:35.901 --> 01:41.929
and see what you think. Well, so they came in there. 
Well, sir, we never have done that before. I said,

01:47.796 --> 01:52.843
well, do you see anything wrong with it, why we 
shouldn't do it? And they said, well, no, sir, I

01:52.823 --> 01:57.849
don't see any reason why we shouldn't do it. I said, 
well, do you like the way the band sounds now? Do you

02:00.793 --> 02:03.836
think we've come a long way with their sound? And 
they said, well, yes, sir, we have. And I said,

02:07.541 --> 02:09.043
well, I'll tell you what I'll do. I want you to try 
this one time. And if they don't throw programs in

02:13.328 --> 02:19.776
the air and throw hats around and you don't get a 
roaring standing ovation, Well, then I'll never

02:20.515 --> 02:23.259
ask you to do it again. And old Brad Harrison, he 
said, well, that's fair enough. So we marched him.

02:28.667 --> 02:31.752
And when he came, well, then we flanked over right 
over the sideline, man. And it was about the time we

02:32.253 --> 02:34.977
got to that battle at the end of the public. I get 
goose pimples every time I think about it. And boy,

02:37.320 --> 02:39.003
they blew the end. They'd never heard the Aggie 
band like that before, ever. And they blew the ends

02:42.605 --> 02:45.410
out of those horns. And it was really a major 
accomplishment for us. And they threw programs

02:51.479 --> 02:53.282
and hats. We got letters from all over everywhere. 
So then they came in and they apologized. And I've

03:00.593 --> 03:04.176
got a letter in my scrapbook in there from this same 
drum major. And they've been doing it ever since.

03:08.520 --> 03:20.051
But you've got to get right under the mouth of the 
gun sometime and really just really let them know

03:08.520 --> 03:20.051
that we play as well as the, because see the Texas 
band, the Texas Tech band, they all come over and

03:08.520 --> 03:20.051
play all the time. So we're marching down the field 
constantly. And all our sound is going that way.

03:26.757 --> 03:28.879
And then coming back it's going that way. And 
nobody really knows, if you don't do something

03:29.129 --> 03:34.257
like that, just how good that band really is. So, 
boy, they said, well, we can go over to the side and

03:34.878 --> 03:39.807
we can do this. And it really made a difference. I 
think it made a... That's one of the first things we

03:41.790 --> 03:50.985
really did that started us on the way to expand 
our... our musical talents. So anyway, then the

03:54.795 --> 04:03.335
band seemed to get so popular that everybody 
wanted them somewhere. This happened in about

04:03.395 --> 04:09.750
the, we'd have our standard things we'd go to, you 
know. and we'd go to 12 football games and we'd go to

04:09.730 --> 04:25.984
12 basketball games we'd go to the six reviews and 
we'd go to the uh battle flowers parade and maybe

04:09.730 --> 04:25.984
one other and then that that was it for the year And 
then all of a sudden they started, all these people

04:26.453 --> 04:42.796
wanted them to come, the Fat Stock Show, and they 
wanted them to come to the Mardi Gras, and they

04:26.453 --> 04:42.796
wanted them to come to the sailing, what did they 
call that, the sailing of the fleet down at Corpus.

04:43.377 --> 04:50.908
So then I changed the military setup mainly to get 
rid of them. lot of the guys got to be seniors and

04:51.142 --> 05:08.593
they didn't have any rank at all and they didn't so 
we we divided the band and made a brigade out of the

04:51.142 --> 05:08.593
band we had over 300 every year and we divided it 
into into two two units which gave these other

05:08.573 --> 05:14.940
seniors an opportunity to be officers, twice as 
many. And that seemed to help more than anything

05:16.082 --> 05:18.424
else we did. And this really, we could call it the 
maroon band and the white band or whatever you want

05:18.465 --> 05:30.919
to call it, but it had two battalions instead of 
one. of these various trips, year after year after

05:31.338 --> 05:38.051
year, which one was your favorite, most 
enjoyable? Well, you know, we had so many. We

05:41.618 --> 05:46.427
started going when Jackie Sherrill came, but he 
wanted us to go everywhere he went. And Jackie

05:46.998 --> 05:49.601
Sherrill was here, I think, six or eight years. We 
missed two football games. Two. And one of them was

05:53.867 --> 05:56.910
in southern Mississippi and the other was 
Alabama. It was just not feasible for us to go to

05:56.951 --> 06:00.455
either one of them at the time and everything. And I 
think they're doing about the same now. And Jackie

06:04.620 --> 06:06.863
was very, very helpful. And it would be very 
difficult for me to say which one was the best. I

06:11.268 --> 06:18.937
think the trip we made to the Meadowland for the 
Kickoff Classic was one of the notable ones when

06:11.268 --> 06:18.937
Jackie was here. And then of course the inaugural 
parade for President Bush, that was a wonderful

06:19.077 --> 06:29.188
trip.

06:29.168 --> 06:32.255
We flew, we'd go to Arkansas every year. Those were 
not so memorable, and LSU, but the last year I was

06:32.275 --> 06:38.349
here we went out of state five times. Now the 
funding for those trips came from what source? I

06:45.841 --> 06:50.110
wanted them to set up a budget for it, but they 
didn't do it. It was just, you know, if the Board of

06:50.190 --> 06:55.601
Regents decided we wanted to go somewhere, they'd 
say, okay, yeah, they'll be there. Well, where are

06:55.641 --> 06:56.663
we going to get the money? Oh, well, let's see, 
so-and-so will give $25, you'll give $50, you'll

06:57.144 --> 07:01.192
give $50. And then when it comes time to giving the 
money, they wouldn't give it. And it always

07:04.842 --> 07:08.169
prolonged everything, but they would raise the 
money. Now Jackie went to see the former students,

07:08.690 --> 07:15.784
Randy Mattson. And Randy and Jackie made a deal 
that they were going to give $25,000 every year so

07:24.670 --> 07:29.964
The $25,000 would go to the Texas trip one year, the 
Arkansas trip the next year. And then when we'd

07:30.786 --> 07:36.360
fly, man, that cost a fortune. We spent $300,000 
that last year. I was there just on trips. And maybe

07:41.714 --> 07:45.000
more. I'd go in there and ask for a couple of bass 
horns and piccolos and say you know we don't have

07:45.020 --> 07:49.870
any money. You know how that goes. But anyway, and 
they've been going and it's much more now than it

07:51.453 --> 07:56.402
was then. So they've been really traveling now. I 
would think that the Meadowlands, or that we

08:02.133 --> 08:14.686
played the Kickoff Classic, or the Inaugural 
Parade, General Darling went with us up there, and

08:02.133 --> 08:14.686
we just had a lot of fun. Was there any of the kind of 
regular trips you made that were more difficult to

08:14.886 --> 08:24.435
deal with than the others? Yeah, when I first came 
here, Everywhere we went, we had to go on bus. We

08:33.029 --> 08:38.078
played in the Hall of Fame Bowl in Virginia, I 
believe. We had to get on a bus, ride all night long,

08:45.232 --> 08:48.039
and then play the game, get on the bus, and come 
back. And we used to do the same thing at Texas Tech.

08:51.528 --> 09:02.515
So I had about all, I'd go in, and I'd say, man, I'll 
tell you what, now this is no, and everybody else,

08:51.528 --> 09:02.515
man, they'd get buses and overnight, but we 
couldn't stay overnight. but so I go in and talk to

09:02.815 --> 09:24.722
General Simpson about it and he agreed and then 
John agreed so then on the big trips like Tech,

09:02.815 --> 09:24.722
Arkansas, LSU, any of those then they started 
letting us spend the night and if we had to go out of

09:02.815 --> 09:24.722
state like we went to the Sun Bowl when Emery 
Ballard was there and we got to fly out there And

09:24.702 --> 09:35.573
then we got, next thing we know, we got a little deal 
that the athletic department agreed that anytime

09:24.702 --> 09:35.573
we have to go out of state, we fly. And the athletic 
department was just absolutely marvelous to me

09:36.802 --> 09:41.347
and to the band. So they helped fund that? They 
helped. You know, they started asking for

09:43.530 --> 09:50.237
donations at the first Cotton Bowl we went to, and 
they got a whole bunch the first year. I don't know

09:50.278 --> 09:53.701
what they're getting now, and they got a whole 
bunch the second year. And they paid for an awful

09:54.342 --> 09:56.465
lot of stuff. During your years, are there any 
donors that deserve special appreciation? Well,

10:02.351 --> 10:04.234
we didn't have many donors, really. We didn't have 
any scholarships. And they offered us a couple.

10:09.962 --> 10:15.671
The son, Ross, came to me and said they wanted to 
give a couple scholarships. And I said, well, I'll

10:15.751 --> 10:19.157
talk it over with the officers in the band. And you 
know, this sounds kind of silly, but this is true.

10:22.382 --> 10:25.507
And we had the COs in there, and we had the drum 
major. And we talked about it and talked about it.

10:27.170 --> 10:30.916
And I said, then we had to decide who's going to get 
it and how they're going to get it. So they talked it

10:30.936 --> 10:34.922
over and came back in and said, we don't want any 
scholarships. He said, who's going to get it?

10:36.168 --> 10:37.310
Who's better than I am? Who's better than he is? I 
mean that's just the way they were. And I think

10:40.415 --> 10:53.957
there's a big difference in the,

10:40.415 --> 10:53.957
I don't say the attitude, but the way things were 
run then and now. That was definitely an old army

10:54.545 --> 10:58.672
back in those days, and it's not that way now. In 
your years, organizationally, you reported

10:59.574 --> 11:07.728
directly to John Colas? General Simpson. I did the 
first year to John Colas, and then General Simpson

11:08.730 --> 11:15.321
came in, and so he was my boss up until... He 
retired, then Howard Perry was my boss. And then

11:19.675 --> 11:24.081
the last three or four years there, General 
Darling was my boss. And they moved us into the

11:24.101 --> 11:26.304
Corps entirely. And so General Darling was my 
boss. And I can truthfully say that he's one of the

11:31.010 --> 11:35.456
nicest, finest gentlemen I believe I've ever 
known. And I really do have a lot of admiration for

11:36.598 --> 11:39.382
him. And we, you know, so see, I wouldn't 
actually... connected with or responsible to the

11:46.233 --> 12:08.173
military people over there they wish I was but I 
wasn't and so that's the setup we had and so then you

11:46.233 --> 12:08.173
know they would have to I wanted them to set up a 
budget for our travels and they never would. And so

12:11.434 --> 12:26.170
I said well it just made it real hard for us to 
function on our budget because what they did was go

12:11.434 --> 12:26.170
ahead and spend our money and then we couldn't go 
over there and even get money for our requisitions

12:11.434 --> 12:26.170
or anything. But anyway it worked I guess. You came 
as the, your title was assistant or associate

12:30.214 --> 12:34.118
director? Associate director. I was the first one 
they had. And you did that for one year. And then I

12:39.968 --> 12:42.661
became the director in 73. I was here in 72 as 
associate director. Describe in those years the

12:45.397 --> 12:53.531
process of how a youngster became a member of the 
Aggie band. How did they? Okay, the first thing, we

12:54.513 --> 13:03.428
sent out information to almost every high school 
in the state about the band. And then mostly, all of

13:04.430 --> 13:10.240
the guys in the band would go to their hometown They 
would go see the principal. They would set up a

13:12.367 --> 13:24.364
night of recruiting in their own high school and 
take movies and show and have information, answer

13:12.367 --> 13:24.364
all the questions about the band. Then they would 
write to me. And I would, we'd go back and forth. And

13:32.918 --> 13:34.461
then they would have these conferences. The 
individual prospect. Yes, yes. Then they would

13:36.526 --> 13:37.828
have these conferences. And we would sign these 
people up. And although there was no formal

13:41.236 --> 13:53.591
audition, they had to see, to see me or my, one of my 
assistants and get, go through the conference and

13:41.236 --> 13:53.591
fill out this sheet. And then, you know, if you had a 
first chair, all state player from spring and

13:54.332 --> 14:03.743
well, he's not going to sit down and play the third 
part, you know how good he is. And so we, you know,

14:04.745 --> 14:07.648
the core was getting smaller. And then we had our 
our recruiting was not near as good in the last four

14:13.366 --> 14:39.070
five six years although we we stayed right around 
300 uh the most we ever had was 358 and now there's

14:13.366 --> 14:39.070
core developments you know i think they give 250 
scholarships a year and they're up to 400. well see

14:13.366 --> 14:39.070
we didn't have any of that yeah and it was tough 
during those years which instruments Generally

14:39.050 --> 14:49.244
were you, did you have a large number of prospects 
and for which instruments a few? You usually had

14:49.845 --> 14:53.310
all of the bass horns you wanted. We would have 34, 
from 33 to 36, 38 bass horns every year. One year we

15:00.960 --> 15:03.724
had 76 trombones. One year we had 94 trumpets. But 
you take your general instrumentation in those

15:06.804 --> 15:15.516
days, and this was, it's just amazing how every 
year it was about like this. You start with your

15:15.916 --> 15:21.944
flutes, you'd have two, maybe, piccolos, maybe 
10, 12 clarinets. And then you go to your

15:23.046 --> 15:32.378
saxophones, you'd have 40 alto saxophones, you'd 
have 40 tenors, somewhere in the neighborhood of

15:23.046 --> 15:32.378
40 tenors. 25 French horns, then trombones 60 to 
70, baritone horns 20, 25, trumpets probably 65 to

15:32.358 --> 15:52.863
85, and predominantly brass. What about 
percussion? Oh yeah, no problem with percussion.

15:55.947 --> 15:59.091
We'd always, we marched, they used to have three 
bass drums, And I always felt like the bass drums,

16:00.168 --> 16:04.692
you should just see them and know they're there. 
It's not a bass drum solo. So they'd get pretty hot

16:07.815 --> 16:11.398
sometime about that, but I insisted. They thought 
they were the reason that the band was staying

16:11.919 --> 16:18.244
together, so they're going to wear out a bass drum 
beater every week. That's not right. So we'd have

16:20.226 --> 16:24.650
two rows of percussion, which was 24. We'd have two 
set of cymbals and two bass drums. So when they

16:28.073 --> 16:30.175
divided up, there'd be one on each. And usually 
that's the way it worked out. But you know

16:33.140 --> 16:36.586
generally speaking that was, it was all brass. So I 
gave, I let the clarinet parts play, clarinets

16:37.427 --> 16:46.042
would play trumpet parts, because unless you were 
starting strides you'd have your piccolos. Some

16:46.082 --> 16:54.576
of you would get a real good piccolo player but you 
know and then we took in the girls and well that was a

16:46.082 --> 16:54.576
five year deal. Let's talk about that in a minute.

17:01.254 --> 17:08.734
Were there any bands that were unusually 
productive, any high school bands, of Aggie band

17:01.254 --> 17:08.734
members? Yeah, we got a lot of them from Houston. 
Well, most of the Houston schools would get a lot of

17:13.000 --> 17:26.073
them from Spring and Memorial, and they were the 
best ones usually as far as the instruments are

17:13.000 --> 17:26.073
concerned. You get a lot from over in East Texas, 
you get a lot of Longview, Piler, Pine Tree,

17:26.093 --> 17:35.042
Lufkin. and get quite a few from Dallas. Then out 
west Texas, sometimes we get one from El Paso and

17:39.670 --> 17:43.998
Abilene and that. But they, and San Antonio, we get 
a lot from San Antonio down there. MacArthur

17:48.225 --> 17:52.192
was the main one. They seem like we got a lot of them 
from MacArthur. But the large schools usually we

17:55.738 --> 17:58.583
got a bunch of them. Do you have any anecdotes you 
could share about someone trying to twist your arm

17:59.558 --> 18:07.668
to be sure that a certain youngster got in a band? 
Oh, well, of course,

18:07.969 --> 18:21.145
most of those folks think that if they had a child 
that was really a nice boy and he was really a good

18:07.969 --> 18:21.145
boy, that if I wanted him in the band I could get him 
in the band. That's not so. They had to have, they

18:26.245 --> 18:31.951
were interested in academic accomplishments or 
you don't get in. Of course that's what I'd try to

18:32.011 --> 18:35.515
tell them and they still didn't believe it. So most 
of the guys you know that came in there had IQs, SAT

18:36.556 --> 18:43.103
scores were at 1150. But you'd get some time, you'd 
have four or five. I remember one time in Conroe,

18:49.930 --> 18:57.019
four or five guys came in there and sat down, all of 
them nice looking boys. And I said, well, what do

18:58.161 --> 18:59.643
you play? I play trumpet, sir. I was all regional. I 
play trombone all state. And then, so what do you

19:06.692 --> 19:09.175
play? Sir, I'm percussion. I'm an all state 
percussion player. So I said, last one, what do you

19:13.120 --> 19:14.943
play? Sir, I don't play anything. And they said, 
sir, this is kind of a deal. Said, if we get these

19:19.789 --> 19:24.695
four in, we'd like to get him in. And I said, well, we 
don't have anybody. And they had about 30 in the

19:26.857 --> 19:29.841
band when I came, but didn't play anything. So I 
said, we don't do that now. You play something if

19:34.767 --> 19:38.010
you're going to be in the band. And so they looked 
and said, well, sir, we kind of plan on all being

19:39.052 --> 19:42.736
together. I said, well, what would you like to 
play? And he would say, I don't know. You want to

19:49.033 --> 19:50.154
play anything? If you're going to be in the band, 
you've got to play a horn. What's the easiest? I

19:54.080 --> 19:56.864
said, well, saxophone, percussion. I said, would 
you be willing to learn how to play? And we'd have

20:02.773 --> 20:04.736
about four or five of these every year. He said, 
yes, sir, I would. I'd like to do that. I said, OK, I

20:07.700 --> 20:14.190
will arrange it for you to have a private lesson a 
week until you can play. And then you will be

20:14.963 --> 20:17.515
allowed to march. And Jay, see he was trying to get 
his music degree and I'd stick him on Jay and he'd

20:18.423 --> 20:25.271
teach him. And so therefore we didn't have anybody 
that did not play. Now the degree of

20:31.338 --> 20:46.877
accomplishment was sometimes not as great as 
others, but I had one of the CO in the band came from

20:31.338 --> 20:46.877
over here at Lafayette, Louisiana and that 
rascal, he'd never played in his life and he picked

20:31.338 --> 20:46.877
the flute. And he was first chair in the flute in the 
concert band when he left. I mean, he was good. He

20:53.800 --> 20:56.102
played the start of the piccolo, you know. And 
that's the kind they were. And that's what they

20:59.105 --> 21:00.547
learned. Saxophone is real easy. You just have to 
punch a star below. And, you know, in six weeks'

21:04.491 --> 21:09.496
time, you can play a saxophone and play most of the 
parts. It's an easy part to play, too. So anyway,

21:13.140 --> 21:16.223
that's the way we managed it. And a lot of the 
mothers would call and say, well, my son's off

21:16.979 --> 21:25.589
state, and he did this, and he did that, and he did 
that. I said, what's his SAT score? She said, well,

21:28.252 --> 21:31.815
it's 1150. I said, you won't have any trouble. 
How'd he finish in his class? I believe he was six or

21:34.699 --> 21:36.200
seven. You just come right on. I don't think you'll 
have any trouble at all. But then on the other hand,

21:39.384 --> 21:43.088
you get a good one, and they said, well, it's about 
700. I said, I don't think he can get in. And that's

21:45.920 --> 21:47.023
true. In your years, when did the fall season begin 
for the Aggie band? It started during Corps

21:57.048 --> 22:02.241
Orientation Week. and they would have just the 
freshmen and that's usually the about the last

22:03.014 --> 22:22.845
week in August except if we had to do something real 
special like an early football game well then then

22:03.014 --> 22:22.845
we could sometime they let us come in early but see 
they didn't want to come in early because they had

22:03.014 --> 22:22.845
to pay for their rooms in the dorm and nobody wanted 
to pay for it So that's why we couldn't do a lot of

22:23.618 --> 22:26.222
this. Like when we went to Meadowlands, they came a 
week early. But we'd take just the freshmen that

22:29.768 --> 22:31.791
week. We'd teach them all the basic steps, left 
face, right face, the rear march, and how to march

22:32.112 --> 22:37.781
65. We'd teach them two or three simple little 
drills, and all week long, two hours a day, I'd be

22:38.161 --> 22:49.660
right there, and the drum majors would be there, 
and that's what we did with them. So they worked out

22:49.943 --> 22:55.008
only, they marched, practiced marching two hours 
a day. That first orientation week. Were they also

22:57.310 --> 23:01.374
practicing instrumentally in addition? No, they 
were not. We just didn't have time. See they were

23:04.918 --> 23:13.126
also going to all the other choral classes and they 
were getting orientated on their English and

23:04.918 --> 23:13.126
their history and they were signing up and they 
were registering. It was a wonderful thing

23:13.487 --> 23:19.933
because they were a week ahead.

23:21.500 --> 23:23.382
Then we wouldn't let the sophomores come. Boy, 
they were tough. It was tough. We wouldn't let them

23:26.346 --> 23:30.832
mess with them until the following week. Only a 
select few were there to stay with them. And they

23:33.635 --> 23:35.718
tried to make it as pleasant as possible. And then 
it's just an absolutely amazing the following

23:37.059 --> 23:44.669
week when they got there, most of them could go 
right in there. They looked like they marched in.

23:47.452 --> 23:49.735
Most of them had been doing that stuff, you know. I 
don't know how they did it, but they did. We'd get

23:52.596 --> 23:55.341
them out there on that drill field, and we'd work 
them. They'd have plenty of ice water out there.

23:57.865 --> 24:00.910
They'd get hot, go get under the shade, blah, blah, 
blah. And that was really a good thing, I can tell

24:01.170 --> 24:03.914
you. They're still doing it, too. Now, the drill 
field in those days for the band was south of

24:05.437 --> 24:10.465
Duncan? It's right there. Yeah, right the way it is 
now. Yeah, yeah.

24:17.002 --> 24:19.524
And what time of day was that, two hours? Five 
o'clock. Oh, you mean for them? Usually it would

24:22.247 --> 24:27.172
be, we'd get an hour probably in the morning and 
then an hour in the afternoon. But we couldn't have

24:28.173 --> 24:29.754
but one hour. And now I looked at the schedule. I was 
up there the other day and Jay told me the schedule.

24:35.159 --> 24:36.400
They're going to get them all week. They're going 
to get to play and that's all they're going to do.

24:39.163 --> 24:41.385
Well, that's wonderful, man. We just didn't have 
that luxury in those days. You know, everybody

24:44.963 --> 24:52.379
thought we got too much time and attention anyway, 
and we just didn't get it. Now, when classes

24:52.840 --> 24:56.208
started, what was the routine then? Okay, they go 
to their classes, and we have it. We have one hour a

24:58.813 --> 25:00.777
day, 5 o'clock. It was from 5 to 6. And we had every 
one of those guys registered as a P class from five

25:02.885 --> 25:07.556
to six. As the time went on and it got so crowded we 
couldn't get them all in but we got most of them in.

25:14.773 --> 25:21.349
And then from four to five those that did not have 
classes would come in the band hall and we'd have a

25:14.773 --> 25:21.349
section rehearsal, get all the music straight. go 
over all the points. By then I'd have all the music

25:23.952 --> 25:30.539
worked out by the step as to how many steps in the 
drill and where to end it in the music. You can do

25:31.060 --> 25:37.087
that just an absolute step if you just work at it. 
And it was really quite a deal. We didn't have but an

25:40.291 --> 25:43.455
hour and And I said, man, we got to practice 
smarter, not harder. We got to do every square

25:47.480 --> 25:53.048
minute of this has got to be learning something. 
And, you know, it takes them. So we'd go the first

25:55.391 --> 26:02.560
two days without music, just the percussion, and 
we'd walk through the drill. We'd get that down

26:02.721 --> 26:03.962
pretty good. And then on Wednesday, we'd put it 
with the music. And that was just, I hated

26:06.606 --> 26:09.349
Wednesdays. Because they couldn't, you know, 
they had to remember it. But anyway, usually by

26:12.342 --> 26:17.751
Friday it was worked out pretty good and it was 
pretty solid. And then we'd go Friday afternoon,

26:17.771 --> 26:26.445
we'd get to practice down at the field because that 
was, it was on astroturf then. And we'd go down

26:27.246 --> 26:30.812
there early and have a little yell practice for the 
football team. They finished at five. And we went

26:32.775 --> 26:34.097
on at five. And normally when you went on the road, 
you also practiced on their field on a farm? Well,

26:40.046 --> 26:40.787
not much. Oh, really? No. Occasionally we would if 
we needed it, but we didn't do that. Most of them

26:48.900 --> 26:51.664
that came down here practiced on ours. but we just 
go go do it and mainly because of the time factor and

26:51.644 --> 27:14.158
when we went to Fort Worth or to two places we'd go 
we'd have that corporate you know we didn't have

26:51.644 --> 27:14.158
time to practice on that now you you were the 
primary planner of the halftime routine I did I

26:51.644 --> 27:14.158
have one of them All right. And you would then share 
that first with what, would it be the Corps

27:15.099 --> 27:21.126
leaders? Well, the first thing we did, we had a, I 
had a draftsman make me a simulated football field

27:21.146 --> 27:33.019
on a piece of paper. I'll show you one if you want to 
see it. And it had it all marked off in five yards and

27:35.642 --> 27:42.450
all the yard lines. So I would draw the drills on 
that paper. Have you ever seen one of them? And I'll

27:50.285 --> 27:52.209
show you the one we'll drill. That's something. 
And so then I would have the drum majors into my

27:53.492 --> 28:03.096
office usually

28:04.713 --> 28:11.523
Either in the middle of about an hour before the 
drill or early in the morning if they couldn't come

28:04.713 --> 28:11.523
then, and I would give them their drill. On Monday? 
On Monday. And if we played Texas on Thursday, we'd

28:15.570 --> 28:19.375
practice on Sunday. They'd get it on Sunday. And we 
would go over it step by step, and I would show them,

28:21.098 --> 28:27.087
okay, we'll do this and we'll do that. Now here's a 
three-step counter march right here. You know

28:29.070 --> 28:29.851
what that is. We'd do a black here to get over there, 
and then you've got a cheetah step here. And you had

28:35.540 --> 28:38.405
to do all that stuff or it wouldn't come out even. So 
then they would go out there, and they would walk

28:39.386 --> 28:43.933
through it with the bugle ranks. And the first, 
usually the first part of them company fronts, you

28:45.685 --> 28:49.733
couldn't do that. They wouldn't have, but then the 
rest of it, they could march through it. And then

28:53.921 --> 28:57.268
they had a pretty good idea of what was going to work 
by the time they got there. And then they'd gather

28:57.869 --> 29:00.434
around, they'd explain it to the band. Of course, 
the bugle rank then knew it. They all got drills

29:02.177 --> 29:03.660
too. So you'd do 12 for them, three for the drum 
majors, and three for the band directors. Every

29:09.893 --> 29:11.035
week we'd do that. And so that's the way it all 
worked out. And we just didn't have time to clobber

29:16.482 --> 29:21.970
around, point everything out. usually when they 
got out there and most of them were afraid not to do

29:22.540 --> 29:46.017
it right I think and they just did better than they 
know how sometimes now uh normally the routine is

29:22.540 --> 29:46.017
how long was how long the southwest conference 
rules stated that you could have eight minutes on

29:22.540 --> 29:46.017
and off the field now there's some schools that 
don't abide by that Texas is on there usually every

29:46.250 --> 29:51.461
time 10 to 11 minutes. But you're supposed to be on 
and off in 16 minutes, both fans, so the football

29:51.481 --> 29:58.997
teams then will have four minutes to get. But 
usually it goes right up. Now a lot of that

30:02.686 --> 30:17.104
sometimes you know you can't do it because 
there'll be people hanging around on the field,

30:02.686 --> 30:17.104
they can't get them off, so you get two or three 
minutes off your schedule, the teams might take a

30:02.686 --> 30:17.104
long time getting off, and it's really kind of 
difficult. But eight was your target? Eight

30:18.445 --> 30:23.091
minutes was your, and you go on longer than that, 
you've lost your audience anyway. Right, then the

30:23.476 --> 30:30.669
opening routine in the north end zone for the 
inning band and the final block tee. When you step

30:30.729 --> 30:33.914
off the field, it's supposed to be done in eight 
minutes. Right, but I was going to ask, how much

30:33.934 --> 30:46.176
time was there between when they first stepped on 
the field at the end, after the bugle call, until

30:33.934 --> 30:46.176
they started? playing in the block T, was that down 
to about six minutes? Well I did it a lot quicker

30:52.904 --> 30:55.778
than that. Because I told them, we don't want a 
minute of you saying recall, step off on . That's

31:05.010 --> 31:05.651
right. And we don't want to waste all this time 
there. And also, we can't waste a minute on a bugle

31:08.656 --> 31:16.788
flourish, bugle rack flourish. Unless we didn't 
have that much drill or something. So you've got to

31:20.574 --> 31:22.176
do this quickly. Because we are timed. and said, I 
really do not care what the other people do. We are

31:29.827 --> 31:38.488
going to be on and off, and if we can't get on, if 
we're not off in eight minutes, it's not going to be

31:29.827 --> 31:38.488
15 seconds longer than that.
