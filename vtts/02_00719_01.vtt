00:02.377 --> 00:31.033
first of all mr allen would you tell us something 
about your early life including the names of your

00:02.377 --> 00:31.033
parents the dates of their birth and death the 
places where they were born where you were born and

00:02.377 --> 00:31.033
the the date of your birth and the schools you 
attended before texas a m okay well my father named

00:02.377 --> 00:31.033
charlie allen my mother's name dolly allen my 
father was born October 12, 1868, near

00:31.908 --> 00:36.774
Smithville, Tennessee. My mother was born March 
11, 1867,

00:38.397 --> 00:51.794
and I might just say that she lived to be 102 in two 
days before she died. She was born near Atlanta,

00:52.595 --> 00:58.523
Georgia, and moved to Texas with her family in 
1874.

01:02.114 --> 01:03.837
Did she ever tell you anything about that trip? 
Well, not very much. She was about seven years old

01:05.759 --> 01:08.343
when they made that trip. And of course, you know, 
back in those days, we youngsters didn't ask the

01:08.504 --> 01:17.457
parents too much or grandparents too much about 
the experiences. Quite a family of them came at the

01:19.480 --> 01:30.717
same time, and I believe they came on the train to 
some central point, and then they had relatives

01:19.480 --> 01:30.717
near central Texas, near McGregor, Texas, where 
they settled. Uh-huh. When did your father come to

01:31.696 --> 01:33.138
Texas? Well, he came to Texas about 1890, and he had 
a brother came out ahead of him down near McGregor,

01:33.218 --> 01:57.467
Texas, and settled there, and my father came there 
and worked several years, and then my mother was

01:33.218 --> 01:57.467
married in 1895, and he bought several farms 
there, and he died in May the 21st, 1954.

01:58.882 --> 02:02.646
My mother died, I might say, March the 13th, 1971. 
And

02:02.807 --> 02:06.992
you were born in McGregor, then? I was born in 
McGregor, Texas, on March the 27th, 1898. Did you

02:10.095 --> 02:14.040
go to the schools in McGregor? Well, yes, but 
before that I went to a country school. It was named

02:16.803 --> 02:18.445
Hawthorne. We lived to the miles from the school. 
It was kind of sparse in those days, and the wolves

02:22.570 --> 02:27.015
were around and that kind of thing. My parents 
wouldn't let me go to school when I was eight years

02:27.620 --> 02:31.205
old, but I started in the second grade. You know, 
about the only thing we had in those days was old

02:31.846 --> 02:34.790
readers. And then I went there for five, six years, 
then went to McGregor School and graduated from

02:35.010 --> 02:39.416
high school there. Was that a one-room school? 
Yes, one-room school, country school. Big old

02:42.801 --> 02:49.830
coal-burning stove, one teacher, 30 or 40 boys and 
girls, country boys and girls. And then you went,

02:49.912 --> 02:53.236
what, through the eighth grade there, and then 
high school in McGregor? Well, I went about

02:53.256 --> 03:00.165
seventh grade there, then went to McGregor, and 
went through high school, McGregor, and then I

02:53.256 --> 03:00.165
enrolled down at the Aggies. What factors were 
involved in your choice of A&M? Well, I had some

03:05.452 --> 03:13.923
schoolmates go there year two ahead of me, and the 
stories they told, it was fascinating. I couldn't

03:14.524 --> 03:17.068
resist. I had no second thoughts. Did, uh, did you 
go through any particular special procedures to

03:20.624 --> 03:27.171
be admitted to A&M? Well, as I recall, we sent our, 
the principal of our high school sent the

03:27.191 --> 03:47.011
transcripts and we made them application and, um, 
I still have the copy of that transcript and, by the

03:27.191 --> 03:47.011
way, I have all my, um, report cards, even when high 
school and college station, A&M. Uh-huh. But

03:48.813 --> 03:50.395
there wasn't much getting in then if you, You know, 
it'd get by and your dad could pay for it, but that

03:50.915 --> 03:53.378
was it. So you had a diploma then from? McGregor 
High School. McGregor High School. Yes, sir. And

03:58.024 --> 04:00.006
that was an acceptable school for A&M, so. Yes. 
Were there any, say, advanced placement tests?

04:06.093 --> 04:13.002
Now, today a student coming to A&M can take a test 
and, say, get credit for freshman English or one

04:06.093 --> 04:13.002
semester of it. Could you do anything like that? 
Well, we never offered anything like that. We

04:16.866 --> 04:20.010
never had anything that presented or, no. Since 
you were somewhat familiar with the customs of the

04:21.678 --> 04:32.934
school, your reaction might be different than 
others, but what was your first reaction to A&M and

04:21.678 --> 04:32.934
College Station when you got there? Well, I 
thought this was the grandest place in the world.

04:37.581 --> 04:39.043
I'm assuming you went there by train? Oh yeah, 
sure, and they'd pile up those trunks that were

04:39.344 --> 04:43.490
mountain-sized. Everybody had a trunk in those 
days. And they hauled them to your room, wherever

04:45.773 --> 04:49.879
you were assigned. then the school was expecting 
you and they had a room assigned to you. How did you

04:56.284 --> 05:02.035
know where to go when you got to the school? Gosh, 
it's been so far back. You know, I think they had

05:04.079 --> 05:11.412
down at the depots, they had guides and things like 
that to kind of... lead you around and get you

05:12.134 --> 05:15.960
associated and kind of place you. I had no 
particular idea of where I'd be placed and what

05:16.481 --> 05:23.171
military company or dormitory when I arrived 
there.

05:26.776 --> 05:27.617
But I believe that's the way it was. They had kind of 
guides. How did you get your trunk from the train

05:29.320 --> 05:33.206
station up to campus? Well, there's an old man 
there with a kind of a like the old grocery cart

05:35.928 --> 05:44.020
years and years ago, wagons had a couple of mules 
and he'd load those things on that truck or wagon

05:35.928 --> 05:44.020
and haul them to his room. He had two, three 
helpers, colored boys, and they'd take them up to

05:44.080 --> 05:48.046
your room. I presume you had your name printed on 
the outside of yours or? Well, I suppose I did, but

05:51.711 --> 05:57.380
we probably put a tag on them and room number and 
dormitory number. Okay. Could you describe for us

06:00.785 --> 06:04.450
a typical day during your years at A&M, that is, the 
time and procedures for getting up and about going

06:04.970 --> 06:22.899
to meals, the time you spent in class and what you 
did other than classwork, and then the time and

06:04.970 --> 06:22.899
procedure of going to bed. Well, soon after we 
arrived that few days, two or three days, we were

06:23.761 --> 06:30.572
enrolled and sign the course that we're going to 
take, sign up for that, and they would give us, sign

06:31.244 --> 06:38.893
us to a military company, and a dormitory, and a 
room number. Of course, a couple of my friends went

06:38.913 --> 06:46.282
down with me from McGregor, and we roomed 
together. Otherwise, we'd have drawn or selected

06:46.903 --> 06:57.796
roommates, and of course, about the meals, the 
first day or two, of course, we'd just hear them,

06:46.903 --> 06:57.796
scare them, get the mess all the best way we could. 
But as soon as they were organized, You know, we

07:00.387 --> 07:10.683
lined up on that military walk and we marched to all 
the meals,

07:00.387 --> 07:10.683
breakfast and the loon and dinner time. And then 
after the meal, of course, we left the meal, the

07:11.144 --> 07:24.224
rest hall, and dispersed without military 
formation back to our dormitory to get ready to go

07:11.144 --> 07:24.224
to class or if we didn't have any classes to, you 
know, other activities. Now that would prevail

07:25.246 --> 07:28.791
all the four years I was there. And of course, by 
going to bed, we had done confined to quarters soon

07:33.226 --> 07:38.772
after dark, a study period for about a couple, 
three hours. And in the early years there, we had a

07:38.852 --> 07:45.880
sentinel that marched up and down the halls with a 
bayonet and carrying a rifle. And to see that no one

07:45.941 --> 07:52.188
left the rooms or gathered in rooms for bull 
sessions and that kind of thing. And then about

07:52.668 --> 08:02.119
9.45, something like that, they had a bugle blow 
that released us from the study and gave us about 15

07:52.668 --> 08:02.119
minutes to get in bed. And they came around and 
checked the doors to see that you were there. But in

08:07.029 --> 08:11.935
the later years, they kind of eased up on that 
slightly, somewhat. But they had very close

08:12.796 --> 08:21.428
supervision over the boys being in the room and not 
having bull sessions and that kind of thing. Well,

08:21.448 --> 08:23.331
when was your room inspected? Well, of course, the 
company commander came around quite frequently

08:24.762 --> 08:36.565
to inspect the rooms, to see they were orderly, the 
beds were made, and they're clean, and the clothes

08:24.762 --> 08:36.565
are in the closet, and that kind of thing. And 
occasionally, the head military men from the

08:36.585 --> 08:44.661
United States, you know, were signed up for the 
ROTC units, came around on a general inspection.

08:44.725 --> 08:52.754
and they would have our closet doors open and 
everything to have them inspect in the closets and

08:44.725 --> 08:52.754
under the bed and everything else. Were you given 
notice that this inspection was to occur? Yeah,

08:56.238 --> 08:58.621
the general inspection, yes, usually yes. But the 
company commander's inspection was sort of...

08:59.502 --> 09:13.618
Well, he could come around anytime and, you know, 
he might, well, on the floor there, sometimes some

08:59.502 --> 09:13.618
of the boys might get unruly and noise and that kind 
of thing, and, you know, you know how boys are.

09:13.733 --> 09:17.781
Yeah, and I lived in a dormitory for four years. 
What was life like in the dormitory? I know that you

09:22.149 --> 09:29.042
said there was a time, a quiet period, when you had 
to be in your room studying, but during the rest of

09:22.149 --> 09:29.042
the day, Well, of course, if you weren't in class, 
you probably went to your room and prepared for

09:29.950 --> 09:48.159
other class sessions or maybe lay down and take a 
nap or maybe clean your rifle or shine your shoes or

09:29.950 --> 09:48.159
get your laundry ready or write a letter back home. 
You know, you always need a little money, you know.

09:50.643 --> 09:52.386
You kept your rifle in your room then? Oh, yes, sir. 
Did you have live ammunition or... Well, when we'd

09:56.967 --> 10:01.871
go out on rifle range practice, but not in the 
dormitory. Not in the dormitory. No, but we'd go

10:02.332 --> 10:04.393
out to rifle practice. We did, yes. Okay. Just kind 
of an aside, I know that at one period, one of the

10:06.335 --> 10:13.521
favorite things was shooting out what's called 
Prexy's Moon. Oh, yeah. Yeah. Of course, some of

10:15.623 --> 10:19.767
those boys, you know, sometimes, you know, it's 
easy to get a hold of a shell, you know. You know how

10:19.807 --> 10:20.768
boys are. They pick up things, and they shoot out 
Dr. W. Brazell was the president in those days.

10:26.733 --> 10:26.873
Uh-huh. And, oh, he was a dandy fella, parted his 
hair in the middle. He was a wonderful fella. He

10:29.945 --> 10:31.367
taught a Sunday school class there, too. Uh-huh. 
Well, I'd understood that he did that for a goodly

10:32.328 --> 10:34.631
number of years. Yes, he did. Oh, they'd shoot that 
precious moon out. Could you tell me what

10:38.916 --> 10:41.459
dormitories you lived in? Well, at first I lived in 
Ross Hall. And that was right on the military walk

10:46.464 --> 10:50.489
facing west, one of the old time halls there. Been 
gone a long, long time. And he called his students

10:52.672 --> 10:56.556
there the Ross Hall Hellraisers. That's what they 
were. Was that just when you were there, or? Well,

11:00.505 --> 11:02.689
no, that was been going on for years. Rawls Hall had 
a reputation. And I lived there, and then I lived in

11:06.055 --> 11:09.582
Mitchell Hall. That was a new one at that time, just 
north of the YMCA. That's gone now. Then I lived in

11:14.732 --> 11:17.397
Leggett Hall, and... And Mitchell was torn down, I 
believe, two years ago. Something like that.

11:20.593 --> 11:21.674
Leggett, I believe, is still standing. Yeah, 
still uses it. And I lived in Ross again. I lived in

11:24.037 --> 11:25.018
Ross, too. And, of course, in that day, the toilet 
facilities in Ross, see, it was three-story

11:25.538 --> 11:31.824
buildings, I recall. The toilet facilities were 
on the third floor. I believe the third floor.

11:36.930 --> 11:39.773
Second or third, I can't remember which, but you 
had to go up there. Okay. I might say the bugle

11:44.697 --> 11:50.647
stand, you know, they blew the bugle, you know, for 
all formations and classes. The stand at that time

11:50.668 --> 11:56.498
was a great big horn, and it was right out of Ross 
Hall, but you couldn't miss the... So you didn't

11:56.518 --> 11:57.900
have any problem hearing it? No, I didn't have any 
problem hearing it. Did... Then you lived in a

12:03.496 --> 12:07.021
different dormitory every year you were there. 
Well, Ross first in last year. Well, no, I lived in

12:08.563 --> 12:11.526
Mitchell the last year. I lived in Mitchell two 
different times, and Ross two different times,

12:11.546 --> 12:16.012
and Leggett Hall. And that's about all the halls I 
moved in. But let's see, the newer ones, Mitchell

12:19.337 --> 12:25.404
and Leggett, probably had bathrooms on each 
floor. Oh, yes, that's right, they did. And Bazell

12:26.866 --> 12:29.129
Hall at that time was the newest. It was built while 
I was at Bazell Hall, after Dr. Bazell. Yeah. What

12:33.601 --> 12:35.203
was the food like in the missile? Well, of course, 
we complained about it, but it was real good. You

12:38.747 --> 12:44.293
know, the old, old fellow named Spieser, whom the 
hall was named for, he was alive in those days. He

12:44.974 --> 12:47.076
was an old Mexican man, as I recall. And we had 
wonderful food. We complained about it a lot, but

12:49.299 --> 12:52.582
then it was good substantial. Boy, I went there 
with about 125, and I left there with 165, so... In

12:57.462 --> 13:05.852
four years, considering all of the exercise you 
got, I presume that was it. Pretty substantial

13:06.119 --> 13:07.541
increase. In those days, we had long tables, about 
12, 15 sets of tables. The upperclassmen at the

13:11.885 --> 13:17.551
end, at the corner of the end, the freshmen in here. 
And the dessert we called kush in those days. And

13:20.534 --> 13:25.279
every now and then, the upperclassmen say, 
freshmen, I'm taking your kush today. That means

13:25.900 --> 13:28.283
the freshmen got no dessert. That happened quite 
frequently. Today there's a custom that it's a

13:30.875 --> 13:35.341
form of hazing, I guess. The upperclassman asks 
the freshman a question, and it's a question if the

13:35.381 --> 13:45.436
freshman doesn't find out the answer by a certain 
time, he has to give up his kush for the day. Well, we

13:45.456 --> 13:52.226
had all kind of trick questions, too, and you never 
knew what kind of answer that brought on kush. In

13:52.326 --> 13:53.988
those days, we had real hazing now. We had these 
belts about that wide. Mm-hmm. A lot of little

13:57.959 --> 14:02.505
boys, not freshmen, after their day or two, they 
didn't sit down very frequently. They got to be a

14:02.525 --> 14:05.028
sophomore. But, you know, it was your friends that 
hazed you. It was your friends that hazed you.

14:11.056 --> 14:11.437
That's right. I imagine, like anything, there 
were a few who abused it. Well, maybe a little bit,

14:17.344 --> 14:19.647
not much. You've got a lot of strapping, but it's 
all good nature. The freshmen, I might say this,

14:28.115 --> 14:32.100
that would not let them haze them were never very 
popular. They were never very popular as a rule.

14:37.007 --> 14:39.390
Oh, at the time, shoot, what's the difference? 
It's all over now. Well, it only lasted for one year

14:40.691 --> 14:42.454
anyway. Only one year. And then next year, we could 
do the same thing. Yeah, yeah. Pass it on. Pass it

14:47.240 --> 14:47.881
on. Pass it on, yeah. Okay. What privileges did the 
upperclassmen enjoy that freshmen didn't have?

14:54.950 --> 14:55.911
Well... Of course, as I say, they got to eat at the 
end of the table in the corner, and that's where the

14:55.975 --> 15:02.201
food was placed when it came in. That was one thing, 
and they got the first serving of the food, of

15:02.221 --> 15:05.765
course, always. And, oh, you know, we had to shine 
their shoes for them and that kind of thing. That

15:12.071 --> 15:13.972
was a privilege not to have to shine your shoes. 
Clean the rifle. They had to do a good job. And they

15:16.975 --> 15:20.339
were granted more permits than that time going to 
Brine. You know, in that day and time, we rode that

15:20.799 --> 15:23.622
old trolley car. There were no automobiles in 
those days, speak of. And that was quite a thing to

15:26.570 --> 15:32.558
go with Brian, go to those picture shows, you know, 
and that kind of thing, to get away from the

15:26.570 --> 15:32.558
reservation. How often could you go as a freshman? 
Well, it seemed like I think we'd go every Saturday

15:35.562 --> 15:46.738
afternoon without a permit from, say, after 
dismissal at noon until formation in the evening,

15:35.562 --> 15:46.738
5, 6 o'clock. And then, of course, you'd go on 
special occasions maybe once a month, you know,

15:46.870 --> 15:50.854
socially with a permit. I have some of those old 
permits here that was granted me. The permit came

15:55.039 --> 15:56.501
from who? Commandant. Commandant. Commandant. 
Yeah, commandant. Military commandant. And did

16:01.286 --> 16:05.250
you have to, did you ask him directly or did you have 
to go through your company commander? I went to the

16:05.270 --> 16:06.111
company commander. I think the company commander 
had to okay it, then it had to be okayed. But the

16:09.895 --> 16:12.138
upperclassmen can go more frequently. Oh, yes. 
And then, of course, in the senior, and I got to be a

16:12.538 --> 16:16.202
senior, well, you'd go on. or without a permit, you 
know, on Saturday or Sunday, that kind of thing.

16:22.708 --> 16:23.370
Quite frequent here. What else for you? Today's 
students, many of them go home every weekend.

16:34.103 --> 16:42.358
Even, you know, I would imagine at the time when you 
were there, say, somebody who would have lived in

16:34.103 --> 16:42.358
Houston could have gone by train without too much 
difficulty. Were any of the students go home on

16:42.398 --> 16:45.985
weekends? Not very often now. McGregor's got 125 
miles from College Station. I only went home three

16:50.132 --> 16:55.622
times in the whole four years, you know. Well was 
that a study and you know the military and your

16:56.243 --> 16:59.829
studies. Of course I took electrical engineering 
which was a lot of math and that kind of thing. It

17:04.097 --> 17:07.243
required a lot of study and we didn't have 
transportation those days. No automobiles at

17:07.263 --> 17:08.325
all. Maybe one or two or three. So mostly you'd go 
home at Christmas then? Oh you'd go home

17:13.073 --> 17:13.935
Christmas. Of course I'd get several days off and 
And of course we'd always, in those days they had

17:17.168 --> 17:23.239
the Cotton Palace Waco, which was kind of like Fair 
Dallas, only smaller. We'd go up there and they'd

17:23.720 --> 17:25.183
play Baylor every year. The cadet corps would go up 
there and stack arms. And of course I'd go on out and

17:27.727 --> 17:32.656
visit my folks overnight while I was there. And 
then things like that.

17:39.448 --> 17:41.472
What did, besides going into Baylor, to Bryan, 
say, to the movie or anything like that, what other

17:41.688 --> 17:48.238
things did the students do for recreation or 
entertainment? Well, of course, we were engaged

17:48.879 --> 17:51.704
in company athletics in those days. We had company 
football teams and old basketball teams and all

17:52.605 --> 17:57.853
kinds of things like that. And, you know, being in a 
military school like that with classes and

17:57.913 --> 18:09.872
supervised quarters, we didn't have a whole lot of 
time, idle time on your hands. No. Well, you didn't

18:12.307 --> 18:14.849
have a memorial student center like they have 
today. No, no, no. With pool tables and things of

18:15.470 --> 18:17.572
that nature. Oh, no, no, no. But were there things 
that you could do at the YMCA? Oh, yes, there was

18:21.776 --> 18:23.437
things like that. But, you know, the YMCA in those 
days was rather small, and they had reading rooms

18:23.497 --> 18:31.344
and a few things like that. And, of course, old boy 
Casey had a confectionary down the basement

18:31.364 --> 18:40.112
there, and you'd go over and get your drinks and all 
that kind of thing. You know, it just couldn't

18:40.092 --> 18:46.710
accommodate nearly what it should have been, of 
course. Because in those days, that was kind of a

18:47.051 --> 18:51.925
new thing, you know.

18:53.710 --> 18:59.279
What about in the rooms, did the fellows gather for 
bull sessions occasionally? Oh yes, you say when

18:59.319 --> 19:14.605
you weren't having class, maybe several of them 
not having class, they'd gather there for a bull

18:59.319 --> 19:14.605
session and all that kind of thing and talk over 
things and maybe study or and then you know there's

18:59.319 --> 19:14.605
games they played you know, you know what games? 
Snake eyes and those kind of things, you know.

19:17.549 --> 19:17.730
Uh-huh. Somebody told me yesterday there was one 
fellow that he knew that worked his way through

19:17.750 --> 19:21.956
school with his pair of dice. I wouldn't be 
surprised. Like Harold Dunn worked his way

19:23.879 --> 19:25.781
through the hamburger stand. Yeah, yeah. You 
talked to Harold Dunn, didn't you? I talked to

19:27.143 --> 19:28.646
Harold Dunn, yeah. He told me about his hamburger 
stand. Oh, yeah. I gather from what he told me that

19:31.310 --> 19:36.037
that hamburger stand probably was not in 
existence when you were there. No, no. No, they

19:37.559 --> 19:38.660
were not. We didn't have anything like that. We 
didn't eat much between meals. It wasn't an

19:43.227 --> 19:44.629
occasion for it. They gave us plenty of food, and it 
was good food. We complained about it, but it was

19:49.235 --> 19:53.121
good food. And those days, most of the students, 
you know, a lot of farm boys, they didn't have much

19:53.181 --> 20:02.775
money to spend on things like that, you know.

20:02.795 --> 20:06.360
Did you have any favorite instructors when you 
were there? Oh yes, Dr. F.C. Bolton, who was head of

20:08.855 --> 20:10.878
the electrical engineering department. Of 
course, since I took electrical engineering, he

20:10.898 --> 20:15.526
was a great, great fellow. Very soft-spoken, 
easy-going, but he was a wonderful, wonderful

20:15.586 --> 20:20.974
fellow. And he gave you a fair deal and that kind of 
thing. And then in calculus, they called him

20:24.279 --> 20:29.888
Cokie, Cokie Smith. And they called him Cokie 
because he, well, some of the boys thought he was

20:30.168 --> 20:35.196
slow and kind of sleepy, that kind of thing. They 
called him Cokie. Well, in calculus, we had a line

20:37.087 --> 20:41.673
up of alphabetic. Of course, my name began with A. 
And it didn't take me long to find out that Cokie

20:43.656 --> 20:51.888
asked me the first question right down the line in 
calculus. But it didn't take me long to know that,

20:51.908 --> 20:55.132
Jerem, you better get that first problem. And my 
mother came down on my graduation and didn't have

20:56.274 --> 21:00.660
motels then, you know. So I got a room to stay that 
night, too, Cokie Smith. He told my mother, he

21:05.403 --> 21:14.272
said, you know, I was the best calculus student he 
ever had.

21:15.173 --> 21:16.974
You were always prepared for that first question. 
I was prepared. And you know, if you made a certain

21:17.755 --> 21:21.819
grade, you didn't have to take the final 
examination. Well, in the assignment, the

21:23.040 --> 21:31.449
problems were all pretty much alike, you know, for 
the assignment, so I don't really have to take any

21:23.040 --> 21:31.449
of that. You say if you had a certain grade, you 
didn't have to make finals. Yeah. Was that for all

21:34.816 --> 21:36.700
four years?

21:39.786 --> 21:41.048
I think it is today. I don't recall, just to tell the 
truth about it, I don't recall. You know, I've been

21:44.314 --> 21:46.238
out of that 54 years. Yes, I know. Today, I think 
there are no final exams for seniors at all. Well,

21:51.590 --> 21:57.838
it wasn't then, I'm sure, if you didn't make 
top-level grades or something like that. And I

21:57.858 --> 22:02.623
think if you have a certain grade, then you can be 
excused from the final. Yeah. But if you think you

22:03.444 --> 22:11.054
can raise your grade, well, you can go ahead and 
take the final, and you kind of gamble whether

22:03.444 --> 22:11.054
you're going to raise it or lower it. Of course, 
there's other professors, you know, and I liked

22:11.174 --> 22:15.099
them all. But, you know, after 54 years, your 
memory's kind of dull, but I do remember those two

22:15.880 --> 22:20.365
very distinctly. Well, let's see, I believe Mr. 
Bolton then became dean of engineering. Yes, he

22:24.847 --> 22:25.207
did. And he was acting as president. Acting as 
president for once or twice. Yes, he did. Did the

22:31.035 --> 22:43.230
students who were officers in the cadet corps 
enjoy any certain privileges that students who

22:31.035 --> 22:43.230
were not officers? Oh, yes, they did. In our own 
particular case, and I know in my senior year, a

22:48.509 --> 22:51.292
couple on a couple of those theaters in Bryan. They 
gave all the cadet officers a pass to those picture

22:51.853 --> 23:12.896
shows, you know, you paid the sale, or the war tax in 
those days was, and that was one privilege, and of

22:51.853 --> 23:12.896
course you got to wear better, you know, boots and 
those kind of things, and that kind of thing,

22:51.853 --> 23:12.896
and... Were these better boots issued to you, or 
did you have to buy them yourself? Uh, but I, was

23:18.850 --> 23:23.440
there a custom of all seniors wearing boots at that 
point? No, not necessarily. Now not like it's been

23:24.182 --> 23:25.805
the last few years. We used these, that's sewn 
after the war, and you know in the war they wore

23:25.825 --> 23:30.556
puttees, leather puttees. Most of them were 
leather puttees. Just the regular shoes. Yeah,

23:35.326 --> 23:36.589
with the leather puttees. Came up here, you know, 
around your cap. We have one picture, and I forget

23:39.050 --> 23:49.066
who's the man, the main man in the picture, but 
somebody wearing a pair of cowboy boots, and he

23:39.050 --> 23:49.066
claims those were the original Aggie boots. They 
might have been back in those days.

23:54.816 --> 23:56.839
Might have been.

24:02.135 --> 24:06.471
What were the attitudes of the students towards 
the administration? And I guess here you had a dual

24:06.491 --> 24:09.161
administrative role. You had President Bezell on 
one hand and the Commandant for the Bull on the

24:09.542 --> 24:13.697
other hand. Well, of course, the bull, the 
commandant, just had to charge the military

24:14.858 --> 24:19.665
affairs only. And, well, I don't know. We didn't 
have any dissension in those days. Oh, you might

24:23.812 --> 24:36.290
fuss about them a little bit, but you heard no 
rabble-rousing or those kind of things about any

24:23.812 --> 24:36.290
of the teachers or professors or the bull, anybody 
else. It was very cooperative. Throughout my four

24:39.876 --> 24:42.960
years there, you didn't hear anything like that. 
No. Oh, a few little complaints, but gosh. Nothing

24:47.508 --> 24:48.450
serious. No strikes, no nothing like that. Okay.

24:54.823 --> 25:03.883
It seems to me I have a picture in the archives 
that's a group of students marching down to Bryan

24:54.823 --> 25:03.883
in 1919.

25:04.572 --> 25:09.901
And somewhere I had the indication that there was 
some kind of a student discontent in 1919. Was this

25:10.562 --> 25:16.932
people who had been in the service coming back and 
exercising some discontent or something? The

25:17.293 --> 25:24.885
only thing I remember marching to Brown when the 
armistice was signed, some of the boys, I recall,

25:17.293 --> 25:24.885
marched over Brown in celebration. But I never 
heard of it. And I was there in 1919. I don't

25:28.811 --> 25:31.035
remember any marching to Brown. And I don't 
remember any protest of a group of students like

25:31.538 --> 25:38.907
that are gathering around the campus talking 
protest. I never heard any of that all the time I was

25:38.987 --> 25:45.095
there.

25:45.295 --> 25:47.197
No, sir. The four years that you were there, do you 
recall that any new traditions were started? We

25:54.146 --> 26:01.495
had some difficulty from time to time finding out 
when something started I think we know about when

26:03.145 --> 26:07.752
the bonfire was first started and a few other 
things. That wasn't there, no. We had the junior

26:09.615 --> 26:15.343
banquet and that kind of thing, you know, and I 
presume we still do. But I don't recall any new

26:16.385 --> 26:27.141
traditions that started while I was there, 
except, you know, first years there, we wore that

26:16.385 --> 26:27.141
old gray uniform. You know, well, it wasn't long 
until we wore it. begin to wear the khaki. That was

26:33.226 --> 26:41.246
one switch from the old type uniform that was 
switched to the year I was there, first year I was

26:33.226 --> 26:41.246
there. That was some tradition that was changed, 
of course. Was that an improvement? Oh yes I liked

26:46.717 --> 27:07.586
it better because well it was more casual I think 
and it was a trend of the times because I was there

26:46.717 --> 27:07.586
during World War I you know over the period and that 
was a trend of the times the khaki was accepted

26:46.717 --> 27:07.586
everywhere and the other uniform you know you'd 
look at well oh that's a bunch of kids or cadets or

26:46.717 --> 27:07.586
something like that you know. Did you have a lot of 
trouble with those or did you have to ever have to

27:08.848 --> 27:15.998
wear those puttees that you wrapped your leg with. 
Yeah we call them wrap leggings. Oh yes I wore them

27:19.828 --> 27:22.030
quite a bit. They weren't bad and you know it took 
you a little while to learn how to wrap them but then

27:22.051 --> 27:28.899
you got away they stayed up just fine. Yeah we wore 
wrap leggings we call them. Yeah I guess the

27:31.662 --> 27:34.265
puttees are really leather. Yeah they came up 
about up to here and had a buckle over here and down

27:34.285 --> 27:39.391
there. They were leather kind of stiff leather 
form leather. Was there a strap that went

27:43.113 --> 27:47.146
underneath the sole of your shoe, too? No, I don't 
recall that. No, I don't think so. It might have

27:50.076 --> 27:50.498
been. I don't think so. Okay.

27:55.651 --> 27:59.695
So, but the, uh, the leather patis, were that 
primarily worn by the officers? Oh yeah, only the

27:59.835 --> 28:01.978
seniors, only the seniors. Oh yeah, that's a 
special privilege. But so all the other students

28:03.479 --> 28:06.042
have to wear the wrap leggings? Well, yes, sir, yes 
they did. And then, of course, on our hat band, you

28:08.405 --> 28:15.112
know, we had a different color hat band up here to 
distinguish the senior from the other classmen. I

28:15.512 --> 28:17.774
believe the senior was gold and black. And, uh, 
freshman that was yellow blue but we had a hat band

28:22.550 --> 28:50.802
you could always tell each year each year had a 
different color yeah then you could tell you know

28:22.550 --> 28:50.802
it's pretty easy to tell a freshman without any 
coloration or anything else you know i believe now

28:22.550 --> 28:50.802
it's uh they have different colored belts oh i see i 
see we call them slimes in those days the fishermen

28:22.550 --> 28:50.802
slimes you know slimy fish uh-huh yeah that was 
your name for the fish slime slime come here slime

28:22.550 --> 28:50.802
make my bed Slime polished my shoes. See what I 
mean? Slime, real slimy. When a freshman

28:58.671 --> 29:08.302
encountered an upperclassman whom he had not met 
before, he had to introduce himself, did he refer

28:58.671 --> 29:08.302
to himself as, say, Fish Jones or Fish Allen? I 
think so, yeah. He didn't get much about fish. They

29:11.726 --> 29:14.028
didn't call themselves slime. Oh, no, we didn't 
call ourselves slime. We called ourselves...

29:18.193 --> 29:19.675
That was... Did you ever have any girls in any of 
your classes? We know that occasionally up

29:24.106 --> 29:30.695
through the 20s there would be a girl or two in 
school. There was one of the professors I recall,

29:31.076 --> 29:40.009
and I forget the professor's name now, daughter, 
or maybe two of them, was in class some of the years I

29:31.076 --> 29:40.009
was there. one or two or three girls, the 
professor's daughters, maybe taking special

29:40.698 --> 29:46.435
courses, and they lived on the campus. I take it all 
the faculty lived on the campus. Well, some of

29:49.423 --> 29:52.251
them, I think some of them lived in Brown, maybe. 
Okay, I believe.
