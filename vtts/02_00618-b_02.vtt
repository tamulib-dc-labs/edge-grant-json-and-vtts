00:04.081 --> 00:08.809
Well, we were tidying up the pre-war bit. You were 
asking questions. I think we ought to get a move on

00:10.331 --> 00:13.636
and talk about the wartime period. All right. Or 
have you got anything else there? No. As a matter of

00:16.641 --> 00:18.504
fact, you've answered my questions there. Now, 
when did you develop an interest in the

00:19.205 --> 00:22.030
submarines? This is the first time I contact you 
with the war. Well, we developed an interest in

00:25.014 --> 00:28.620
submarines before the war. Because we were 
measuring gravity in submarines. We didn't get

00:31.456 --> 00:37.204
much done before the war because something was 
always going wrong. There were these crises, the

00:37.244 --> 00:42.231
Munich crisis, for example, stopped us using a 
submarine. I didn't ever go out in the submarines

00:43.112 --> 00:45.535
before the war. This other man, Brown, was doing 
that.

00:50.242 --> 00:54.488
I never had pretty much to do with submarines 
during the war.

00:57.372 --> 00:58.033
Well, shall I? start talking about how I got 
involved with the Navy. Right, exactly. That's

01:03.142 --> 01:08.129
where I want you to begin, and then talk about 
minesweeping. Yes. Well, it seemed to me, about

01:10.171 --> 01:19.024
1938, that it was likely there was going to be a war. 
Actually, I didn't think there was, but I mean,

01:19.364 --> 01:23.430
there was obviously a reasonable possibility of 
it. And I thought it would be nice to keep our small

01:24.119 --> 01:28.025
group together. We had, we were a very small group, 
there was this man I've talked about, Brown, who'd

01:28.045 --> 01:41.665
been doing the work on the submarines, there was 
myself, there was this assistant, and a couple of

01:28.045 --> 01:41.665
graduate students, so there were five or six of us. 
And I thought it might be nice to keep the work, the

01:42.446 --> 01:48.135
group together and to the war and also relevant to 
our peacetime interests. And Ewing had much the

01:55.345 --> 01:58.190
same idea about the same time. And I had quite a 
struggle actually to get into the Navy, to get the

01:59.151 --> 02:07.344
Admiralty to accept the idea at all. The Admiralty 
Scientific Organization before the war was

02:07.665 --> 02:16.198
somewhat unsuccessful. They had a rather low 
prestige at the service. They were paid a bit less

02:20.328 --> 02:23.632
than the corresponding naval officers. They had a 
chip on their shoulder about this. And there'd

02:27.315 --> 02:32.240
been very little money, of course, for the 
services between the wars. I mean, you just had one

02:32.260 --> 02:34.202
war and you'd won it. Naturally, you don't spend a 
lot of money on defense. And then this attitude

02:37.585 --> 02:41.950
hung over into the Hitler period. The defense 
budgets were opposed every year. in detail by the

02:45.710 --> 02:52.919
Labour Party and there was always a row every year 
about the financing of defence. And they'd been in

02:54.341 --> 03:01.489
a very poor way so far as developing the things that 
needed to be developed. Well, I went round and I saw

03:01.509 --> 03:10.220
the man who was looking after recruiting 
scientific personnel and I said, look, why don't

03:01.509 --> 03:10.220
you take the whole thing as a package deal? And he 
said that he estimated the number of scientists

03:11.081 --> 03:15.126
required by the Navy at 30. number of extra ones if 
war broke out. And I said I didn't much believe it.

03:20.665 --> 03:30.498
We went on and I think the thing that finally 
decided me was that I'd discovered how sonar

03:20.665 --> 03:30.498
worked and what the frequencies were and 
everything. Because we'd been out with the naval

03:30.518 --> 03:39.230
ship doing seismic work and I'd kept my eyes open 
and learnt quite a lot about what the navy was doing

03:30.518 --> 03:39.230
and so on. And I think he thought it was safer to have 
me inside than wandering around outside. At any

03:43.473 --> 03:48.778
rate, I started off by going to the anti-submarine 
establishment. And this was a pretty

03:48.798 --> 03:54.843
unsatisfactory organization. And I think I was 
building up for a row with the management of it when

03:54.863 --> 04:04.732
I was suddenly removed. I think they saw the red 
light that I was going to be a bloody nuisance. And

04:08.455 --> 04:12.619
so I suddenly got transferred to protecting ships 
from magnetic mines. Now, I've told this story, I

04:13.662 --> 04:19.893
think I've told it in print. I wrote a... Now, I'm 
not sure that I have, but let me tell you the story.

04:25.623 --> 04:27.766
You're not going to publish this stuff, are you? 
It's an understanding between us that you aren't

04:27.786 --> 04:32.675
going to publish this stuff with descriptions to 
me. I mean, I don't want suits for the library. Cut

04:34.919 --> 04:35.600
it off from me. Okay.

04:39.329 --> 04:43.873
Next piece, I have placed certain restrictions on 
it. Well, I found myself working with a group who

04:43.893 --> 04:53.161
were interested in demagnetizing ships to 
prevent them being blown up by magnetic mines. And

04:53.862 --> 04:55.544
it was a real comic opera show. I was put to work with 
a man whose name I will not mention. And he was a

05:00.328 --> 05:03.791
little older than me, probably five or ten years 
older than me. And he put me to stand on the quay. And

05:07.763 --> 05:16.593
he made a measurement, and when he made his 
measurement, he waved his arm, and I then said,

05:07.763 --> 05:16.593
move her along 10 feet, Skipper. And Skipper moved 
the boat along a key 10 feet, and he took another

05:16.613 --> 05:20.377
measurement. Well, the only question was how long 
I'd let this go on for. I was 30, 31 at the time, and I

05:25.063 --> 05:32.751
let it go on for a day or two, and then fate played 
into my hands. Along came a committee which was

05:34.763 --> 05:38.709
inquiring into the Admiralty's use of scientific 
manpower. And the chairman of it was Ray Fowler, a

05:40.031 --> 05:48.263
well-known physicist, a friend of mine, 
son-in-law of Rutherford's, married

05:40.031 --> 05:48.263
Rutherford's daughter. And he came up to me and 
said, what are you doing? And I described it in just

05:52.790 --> 05:55.313
the words I've given you now. And he said, do you 
think this is a good thing? And I said, well, you can

05:57.817 --> 05:59.239
judge that. And then I thought, this might not be 
sufficient, so I thought I'd better emphasize the

06:00.201 --> 06:04.467
matter. So I went around that evening and saw the 
admiral, who was staying in a hotel in Portsmouth,

06:04.852 --> 06:12.003
who was in charge of all the anti-mine operations. 
And I went to see him and I said, look, we're having

06:13.165 --> 06:17.071
trouble about reports. Old so-and-so is running 
this show, can't make up his mind whether the ship

06:18.233 --> 06:24.402
sailed from left to right or right to left. And we 
redrafted the diagram several times and there's

06:24.602 --> 06:29.910
been a lot of delay in getting the reports out. But I 
have black market copies of these reports of which

06:29.930 --> 06:33.576
I can supply you. And he looked at me and said, I 
think I'd like one. So I wasn't sure what he was

06:37.989 --> 06:40.713
going to do. I thought he might be very indignant 
because he's now the lead admiral. And so I said,

06:45.619 --> 06:46.880
well, that's all right. I'll regularly supply 
reports a week or two ahead on their issue. And then

06:51.466 --> 06:58.855
the next day, I was, in the middle of the morning, I 
was asked to go around and meet a committee and I

06:59.088 --> 07:11.550
found my admiral in the chair and my friend from the 
committee that was inquiring into admiralty

06:59.088 --> 07:11.550
who's a scientific manpower next to him and a 
number of other civilians and naval officers

06:59.088 --> 07:11.550
there. And they said, I wasn't sure what was going 
to happen, but they said, look, will you take over

07:12.652 --> 07:19.103
the direction of this show? And I said, what show 
precisely? And they, rather to my surprise, said,

07:22.223 --> 07:28.212
not only the things I've been concerned with, but a 
rather wider group of things. And I said, yes, I'd

07:28.913 --> 07:33.660
be pleased to take it over, but I have a condition. 
And they said, well, what's the condition? I said

07:35.423 --> 07:38.467
that six people named by me be removed from the 
project. And I then got rid of all, they said they

07:39.549 --> 07:46.459
agreed to this, and I got rid of all the permits that 
the servants had. we reached an agreement that

07:46.827 --> 07:54.859
they would form a small group not responsible to me 
to investigate the longer term matters. Well, the

07:55.641 --> 08:03.092
war was only going to last a finite time, so I wasn't 
very interested in anything that the civil

07:55.641 --> 08:03.092
service called a longer term project. So then the 
first time I was in charge of something, the first

08:04.014 --> 08:15.231
time in my life when I'd ever had a group of people 
responsible to me. I had a naval officer member, a

08:15.937 --> 08:24.346
lieutenant commander called Hex Lewis, and he and 
I were responsible for this group. And there were,

08:24.366 --> 08:32.635
at the peak of the thing, we had 50 naval officers 
and about 50 civilians and a decent sized group. It

08:32.835 --> 08:39.042
was the first time I'd ever been able really to do 
things on a large scale and had a what was really a

08:39.376 --> 08:41.619
project. This was the start. I'd learnt how to 
manipulate the Navy, how to get your way, you see,

08:43.462 --> 08:58.263
by a sort of rather cheerful openness and assuming 
that everything would come out right and so on. I

08:59.445 --> 09:05.974
must have learnt awfully quickly because I had 
never before been charged of anything more than

08:59.445 --> 09:05.974
two graduate students. Before the war I'd had two 
graduate students and suddenly I'd got this

09:06.258 --> 09:18.036
project and the naval officer, who was my opposite 
number, was very helpful to me. He knew much more

09:18.056 --> 09:23.144
than I did about how the world worked and how to run 
things. And we had the greatest fun with it. We had

09:25.487 --> 09:34.982
this tremendous success with the acoustic mine, 
with the demagnetizing of ships and so on. We had to

09:36.295 --> 09:42.364
move out of Portsmouth because it was being bombed 
and we were spending all our time ending damage. I

09:43.485 --> 10:05.256
took the thing up to Scotland and we went up to a 
place on the west coast of Scotland and then almost

09:43.485 --> 10:05.256
at once I was called down to the Admiralty and I went 
to see the Director of Torpedoes and Mining, a man

09:43.485 --> 10:05.256
called Captain Middleton, and he said, look, we 
think we've got an acoustic mine. And I said, well,

10:06.485 --> 10:08.628
why do you think so? Are you sure? And he sent me 
around to see the intelligence people. And I was

10:13.154 --> 10:14.555
convinced they were right. They had got an 
acoustic line. So I then went back to the director

10:16.217 --> 10:18.721
of torpedoes and mining. He said, I want you to do 
something about this. Leave the people in

10:22.025 --> 10:25.649
Scotland and do something about it. So I said, all 
right, what do you want me to do? He said, I don't

10:27.031 --> 10:27.632
know. That's your business. Go and do something. 
So I suddenly... had to start a new organization

10:34.767 --> 10:38.532
for dealing with acoustic mines. And very soon I 
found myself in charge of all development of

10:39.333 --> 10:46.543
minesweeping, development of methods of 
minesweeping from the civilian side. I had a naval

10:46.583 --> 10:48.565
officer number. And what I did was we'd been 
operating in, we'd taken over a dance hall. We'd

10:57.998 --> 10:59.800
been operating in this dance hall. And we'd left it 
because the whole place had been wrecked. And we

11:03.944 --> 11:07.487
burnt the pier later. Anyway, I decided to go back 
into this place. It was the only place I was quite

11:10.070 --> 11:12.692
sure I could get quickly. So we went back into this 
dance hall and told the post office that the wicked

11:13.353 --> 11:19.599
people who'd had it last had removed all the 
telephones. Would they please come and put a new

11:19.659 --> 11:22.462
lot of telephones in? And we also set up a little 
show in Hairidge. And we started off after

11:27.147 --> 11:29.789
acoustic mines. And this was a real success. No 
acoustic mine practically ever sank a ship again.

11:34.589 --> 11:36.691
We had wonderful fun with this. And, well, I don't 
think there's any point in going into it in detail,

11:38.573 --> 11:50.965
but this was a new thing to me, a new sort of world, 
quite rather different from the ordinary

11:38.573 --> 11:50.965
scientific world. It was not a competitive thing. 
It was a group of people with a common object trying

11:53.648 --> 12:00.975
to achieve a particular object. And also, of 
course, it was to some extent the effort to inflate

12:04.475 --> 12:15.446
one's own organization, the typical thing, the 
Parkinson syndrome, where you try and build up

12:04.475 --> 12:15.446
your own organization. And by this time, of 
course, we were more or less official wizards. We

12:19.611 --> 12:20.972
could get anything we wanted. I mean, there was a 
transformation now. Before the war, we couldn't

12:23.134 --> 12:25.096
get 10 pounds. Now we could have anything we 
wanted. And we presumed on this. We did anything we

12:30.422 --> 12:32.524
bloody well liked. a young man coming in one day and 
saying, look, I hope you don't mind, I've taken

12:32.825 --> 12:38.611
over the Portsmouth Yacht Club. Well, the 
Portsmouth Yacht Club is a very sort of

12:39.252 --> 12:43.556
upper-crust organisation. And this young man had 
simply gone in and commandeered it. And I said,

12:45.939 --> 12:48.782
well, I suppose it's all right, what do you want it 
for? He told me what he wanted to do there. And I

12:50.284 --> 12:58.873
said, well, all right, go and get the paperwork 
done, go and see the administrative people, tell

12:50.284 --> 12:58.873
them to go through the paperwork and compensate 
the Yacht Club and all that. And we took over... A

13:01.293 --> 13:05.318
rich man's yacht, I remember, because we thought 
it might be nice for some purpose or other. We might

13:05.338 --> 13:08.221
want it to go somewhere. And unfortunately, it got 
hit by a shell coming through the Straits of Douma,

13:08.261 --> 13:13.107
so we never really got it.

13:16.251 --> 13:25.022
And well, then we burnt the pier associated with 
this dance hall. And then shortly after that, the

13:25.182 --> 13:29.427
whole place got burnt, our firefighting party. 
was engaged in rescuing a lady we all liked very

13:29.862 --> 13:33.847
much in a local pub. She was a barmaid in a local pub, 
a girl called Piggy. By the way, I should have said

13:39.033 --> 13:50.267
the only bit that I wish to place restrictions on is 
the little piece about the incompetence of the

13:39.033 --> 13:50.267
people at Portsmouth before I took charge. It's 
only about half a minute. I don't want the rest of

13:52.630 --> 13:55.093
this, you're quite free to do as you like. but 
simply the bit about the man I stood on the pier

13:55.377 --> 14:06.791
with, and he waved his hand, and I said, move along 
ten feet, and the bit about how we got the six people

13:55.377 --> 14:06.791
removed from the project. I would like that not to 
be used without your asking me whether I approve

14:06.891 --> 14:13.819
the passage. I shan't be unduly restrictive about 
it, but I've just got to guard myself against

14:13.880 --> 14:18.365
accusations of libel. Right. Well, anyway, we 
then... We then decided that Portsmouth had

14:24.757 --> 14:27.862
become uninhabitable. We went up to Edinburgh and 
we set up an organisation there. We took over part

14:33.170 --> 14:36.816
of a school and set ourselves up there. It was a 
curious incident in which I was driving around

14:36.876 --> 14:45.910
Edinburgh looking for a suitable building and I 
saw a great big building on the top of a hill. I said,

14:45.990 --> 14:46.992
let's go and look at that. What is it? They said, oh, 
that is Fitties College, which is a public school.

14:51.217 --> 14:56.382
Well, I thought it's time I got my own back on the 
headmaster of a public school. So I went in to see

14:56.402 --> 14:59.945
the headmaster and told him we were thinking of 
taking over the school. And I got no result at all,

15:01.086 --> 15:10.594
because he just said, that would be a good thing, 
because I'm sure the public schools are finished,

15:01.086 --> 15:10.594
and we should get a lot of compensation. And then I 
had to confess all I was going to take over was one of

15:10.614 --> 15:13.917
the houses. And he was worried about this, because 
he said the army were at present occupying it, and

15:14.778 --> 15:20.683
he thought they'd do more damage than we would. And 
I said this was a superficial view. The army would

15:23.990 --> 15:26.452
undoubtedly wreck the building. But we would do 
much more than wreck it. We would build

15:29.055 --> 15:35.041
attachments, build tanks all around it. And we 
would knock down partition walls. We would do real

15:37.603 --> 15:39.745
structural damage. Whereas the army would only 
sort of muck up the paintwork and write rude words

15:39.765 --> 15:46.352
on the ceilings and that kind of thing. And so he 
said he was very well satisfied with this. I

15:50.937 --> 15:53.780
imagine they had to rebuild a building to finish 
it. Well, anyway, we had another of these

15:54.922 --> 15:59.307
successes.

16:02.110 --> 16:11.882
I think the sinkings from mining never again 
reached 10% of the sinkings from submarines in any

16:02.110 --> 16:11.882
month in the war or something like that. I forget 
the actual figures. I published an account of this

16:13.504 --> 16:16.928
to which I can give you a reference. Did you have any 
cooperation with the US Navy research in this

16:17.903 --> 16:21.106
area? Well, we had a funny thing. We decided the US 
Navy were not taking the mining problem

16:23.128 --> 16:27.292
seriously. Because for them, it was potentially 
very serious. The submarines could operate off

16:29.814 --> 16:36.140
the east coast of the United States, and they could 
lay mines and block up the harbors. And so we asked

16:37.101 --> 16:41.665
the US Naval attache to come down and have dinner 
with us. And he came down, and we talked to him and

16:42.666 --> 16:47.691
told him what we were spending and what we were 
doing. And I got the impression we weren't having

16:48.532 --> 16:52.276
much effect. And what I didn't realize was that in 
dealing with an American bureaucracy, one is not

16:52.296 --> 16:59.023
fighting friction, one's fighting inertia. It 
gets moving rather slowly, but every bit of

16:59.744 --> 17:04.309
pushing you do has its effect. It's not like when 
you push against friction, nothing happens until

17:04.830 --> 17:09.335
you reach a critical push. So that in fact, we went 
on pushing much too long. And an enormous and very

17:14.941 --> 17:21.730
extravagant organization appeared over here, 
particularly for protecting ships and magnetic

17:14.941 --> 17:21.730
mines. And we spent the rest of the war trying to 
damp it down on the grounds that it was an

17:22.471 --> 17:26.676
extravagance. Well, anyway, at this point, 
somewhere about the beginning of 41, I began to

17:27.757 --> 17:44.138
feel that we'd taken the guilt off the subject of 
mines and things, and no ships much were being

17:27.757 --> 17:44.138
sunk. We'd done a good job on hypothetical minds 
and what we might do in the future, and I asked to get

17:44.607 --> 17:52.014
out of it. So I then got out of it. I'd learned a great 
deal about how the Navy works, about the Navy,

17:54.497 --> 18:02.545
about how to work on a large scale at sea, how to do 
all kinds of things. And I'd learned about naval

18:04.187 --> 18:10.513
officers and the sort of things you could do with 
them and the things you couldn't. We'd survived

18:11.540 --> 18:18.427
various disasters in which we'd bust up bits of 
battleships, that kind of thing. We once broke the

18:21.109 --> 18:27.516
back of an American force track destroyer, I 
remember, in a misfortune. Well, and all these

18:27.536 --> 18:29.237
kinds of things. Well, then I went up to the 
Admiralty, and I went to work with the Director of

18:30.499 --> 18:39.167
Scientific Research in the Admiralty. And very 
soon after this, I was a rash young man, a young man

18:39.772 --> 18:59.131
in a hurry, and I decided that the original place 
I'd been to at the beginning of the war, the

18:39.772 --> 18:59.131
anti-submarine establishment, the direction of 
it had become intolerable, and we must remove the

18:39.772 --> 18:59.131
direction of it. And I don't know if the man 
concerned is dead, and I think I'd better restrict

19:00.753 --> 19:05.998
this piece. But I said, to the director of 
scientific research that he must get rid of this

19:09.353 --> 19:29.499
man and remove him to somewhere else, that he was 
not running a good show in the anti-submarine

19:09.353 --> 19:29.499
side, it was ineffective, he was an egomaniac, and 
was keeping a very tight, close control over

19:09.353 --> 19:29.499
anything, he was not getting the best out of his 
people, and it was going to be a bloody awful row.

19:29.519 --> 19:35.226
And the director of scientific research, Daryl 
Charlie Wright, refused to remove the man. And I

19:35.780 --> 19:37.682
said, well, I won't work for you. If you say that, I 
won't work for you. I'm walking out on you. You can

19:40.125 --> 19:42.448
do what you bloody well like about it. And then a 
very curious state of affairs ensued. I went

19:46.353 --> 19:53.381
across the road and went to see Patrick Blackett, 
who was just inventing operations analysis, and

19:46.353 --> 19:53.381
went to work with him. And I kept forgetting that I 
wasn't on speaking terms with Charlie Wright, the

19:53.421 --> 19:59.488
representative of research. He used to cut me in 
the street. And finally, there was a thing called

20:04.720 --> 20:14.131
the Midnight Follies, which was a meeting once a 
month with the first sea lord, and most of the other

20:04.720 --> 20:14.131
sea lords, to have an account of the state of the 
war. And about, I saw right there, and I thought

20:14.992 --> 20:22.400
it's absurd that you continue this argument, so I 
sat down, obviously across a rather narrow table.

20:22.961 --> 20:25.964
He looked this way, and he looked that way, and he 
wouldn't look me in the face. And finally, after

20:26.986 --> 20:31.791
the thing broke up, I saw him standing, in front of 
the first sea lord and the third sea lord, who was

20:32.243 --> 20:36.774
his own boss. And I knew that he was frightened of 
admirals. And so I went up to him and said, all

20:40.784 --> 20:46.097
right, it is nice to see you. And he looked at me. He 
looked both ways. And he saw these two admirals

20:48.222 --> 20:50.067
standing there. And he put his hand on my shoulder 
and said, my dear Bullard, it is indeed nice to see

20:50.671 --> 20:56.439
you again. And ever since then, we've been 
buddies. And this curious thing, the last time I

20:57.961 --> 21:03.749
had anything to do with him was a few months ago. I 
was in Victoria, British Columbia. And I called

21:06.373 --> 21:09.377
him up and said, look, I'm awfully sorry. I was 
hoping to come and see you, but I can't. I haven't

21:11.399 --> 21:12.281
got time. I'll see you next time I'm here. And he 
said, I don't think you will. And he died a month

21:16.767 --> 21:18.349
later. He was a dear man in a completely wrong job. A 
gentle, intelligent man who, after he retired

21:23.580 --> 21:38.115
three times in all, and he had this job as Director 
of Scientific Research in the Admiralty, which he

21:23.580 --> 21:38.115
was completely unable to carry out, really. It was 
a disaster. Well, I think because he's dead, and

21:39.717 --> 21:48.066
because he was a friend of mine, that little piece 
ought to be restricted in the sense I'd like to know

21:39.717 --> 21:48.066
what people say about it before they use it. Well, 
then I got into operations analysis and direction

21:49.396 --> 21:59.854
of the war, use of facilities. The idea was that the 
war was by now getting pretty far along. This was

22:03.721 --> 22:10.172
getting on in the middle or late 41, probably 
August 41.

22:12.683 --> 22:17.729
It was dubious if any new technical developments 
would really have a critical effect. And then, of

22:17.749 --> 22:25.197
course, not very long after this, the Americans 
and the Russians came in at the end of December 41,

22:17.749 --> 22:25.197
and the war was clearly won. It was only a matter of 
time. And the important thing was to have rational

22:26.739 --> 22:39.754
views on the use of forces, things like the size of 
convoys, questions of this sort.

22:40.831 --> 22:42.994
I started taking interest in all these questions. 
It didn't really suit me all that well, I don't

22:43.995 --> 22:47.219
think. I hadn't got Blackett's optimism of the 
importance of what we were doing. And I rather

22:52.966 --> 22:59.014
drifted off into the interpretation of 
intelligence in terms of operations. And I had a

23:00.315 --> 23:09.927
curious job for a while looking after 
intelligence on V weapons. The flying bombs and

23:10.244 --> 23:13.209
rockets. I was the admiralty representative on a 
committee on this subject. And I went there, and I

23:17.676 --> 23:23.926
was also a member of this curious little 
committee. There was a high level service

23:24.707 --> 23:29.335
committee, which I was the admiralty 
representative. And then there was a working

23:29.896 --> 23:35.745
level committee on intelligence connected with 
these things, a very curious kind. The war office

23:36.147 --> 23:40.432
was represented by a man who ran a chain of 
laundries in peacetime. The invasion armies were

23:41.913 --> 23:45.557
represented by an Oxford philosopher. I 
represented the Admiralty. And the Air Force was

23:48.500 --> 23:53.726
represented by the dumbest air commodore anyone 
who had ever seen. And this was a very curious body

23:54.667 --> 23:58.090
indeed. I mean, very important things hung on it. 
How much effort should you use? to destroy the

24:02.658 --> 24:05.421
flying bomb sites in France. It meant diverting 
bomber effort from Germany. What was the proper

24:08.284 --> 24:10.006
balance on this? How did you persuade the Air Force 
that the threat was serious? And it wasn't just the

24:14.691 --> 24:17.433
Air Force maintained. It was just a method of 
diverting effort from the bombing of Germany. It

24:20.897 --> 24:21.778
was all a spoof. And all this kind of thing. And I got 
deeply interested in this. And then in the middle

24:26.763 --> 24:30.387
of it, I suddenly got pulled out And if you've got to 
go now... No, no, I'm trying to keep the tape. Ah,

24:35.306 --> 24:36.107
yes, sure. Well, in the middle of it, there was 
trouble, because Duncan Sands, who was

24:36.127 --> 24:49.747
Churchill's son-in-law, was chairman of the 
high-level committee, and the air ministry

24:36.127 --> 24:49.747
representative was the commander-in-chief of 
fighter command. And the commander-in-chief of

24:50.789 --> 24:57.358
fighter command was a man called Roderick Hill, 
who was a wonderful man. I was devoted to him. And he

24:59.155 --> 25:00.657
was getting in trouble. He wouldn't bring an 
officer with him who knew about the details, and he

25:00.677 --> 25:07.285
really didn't know the details, and he was making 
an ass of himself. And it was an embarrassment to

25:07.305 --> 25:11.510
Sands and everyone, and Sands didn't like him. And 
Sands suggested that I join his staff and look

25:11.530 --> 25:19.639
after all the details of this. And Hill said he 
wouldn't have anyone recommended by Sands,

25:19.659 --> 25:27.829
because Sands was not universally popular, to the 
least of it. Then at a cocktail party, I met Hill

25:28.417 --> 25:30.879
again. And he said, look, are you the man Sands is 
trying to foist on me? And I said, yes. And he said, I

25:37.506 --> 25:38.987
believe we've got a deal. So I went out to work at 
Fighter Command, and essentially to protect Hill

25:39.868 --> 25:48.336
from politicians. Various people in Sands' 
entourage, Sands was Churchill's son-in-law and

25:49.737 --> 25:55.943
member of parliament. the minister, and he was 
sending his dogs' bodies out, who went through the

25:56.041 --> 26:05.731
files of Fighter Command, looking for rude 
letters about sands, of which there were plenty.

26:06.532 --> 26:12.238
And my job was to keep these people out of the place, 
without defending sands so much that there was a

26:06.532 --> 26:12.238
row. And so I was normally head of the operations 
analysis of Fighter Command, but in fact I was

26:13.038 --> 26:20.786
political protector to the commander-in-chief. 
And this was really most entertaining. And after

26:23.851 --> 26:28.458
the sights had been overrun in France, I said, 
well, this is now finished. I'll go back to the

26:28.538 --> 26:29.679
Admiralty. So I went off back to the Admiralty. And 
a month or so later, Roddy Hill called me up and

26:31.863 --> 26:41.977
said, look, would you go over to France and see that 
we don't have a lot of fuss there? Because there

26:42.017 --> 26:45.502
were rockets being fired at Antwerp. And so I had a 
lovely time. I said, well, look, give me a staff of

26:46.704 --> 26:49.588
some sort. And he supplied a group captain and a 
squad leader and a couple of WAFs and that kind of

26:50.108 --> 26:55.393
thing. And we went over just after Christmas, I 
think it was, 44, to set up an organization in

26:55.413 --> 27:08.186
France to make sure that no one could complain 
about what was happening about flying bombs in

26:55.413 --> 27:08.186
France. And we decided the war was obviously won, 
and we might as well see how big an organization we

27:09.007 --> 27:16.655
could set up before it finished. We got up to 2,000, 
I think. We published a daily newspaper of some

27:20.230 --> 27:25.580
sort in Paris. I think we actually laid a cable 
under the channel. We certainly had a dedicated

27:31.570 --> 27:38.222
cable under the channel of our own for 
transmitting information.
