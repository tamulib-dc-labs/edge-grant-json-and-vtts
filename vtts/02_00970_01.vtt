WEBVTT

00:01.499 --> 00:02.801
Okay, we're on. Could you give a biographical 
background of your situation in Vietnam, such as

00:04.184 --> 00:15.806
your outfit duration, when you were drafted, 
etc.? Okay, I was drafted in, my name is Bob

00:15.826 --> 00:23.220
Corbett, and I live in St. Paul. My dad is a veteran 
of World War I and World War II, and I was drafted in

00:23.909 --> 00:41.867
October of 68. And I ended up going through the 
infantry school at Fort Benning and arriving in

00:41.847 --> 00:52.281
Vietnam in early September of 1969. And I was 
assigned to Charlie Company, 2nd of the 27th

00:52.301 --> 01:00.512
Wolfhound, a unit inside the 25th Division. We 
were headquartered at Cu Chi, and I spent most of my

01:01.213 --> 01:04.918
time The first half of the year in the field with the 
Charlie Company out near Hard Spot, Harris,

01:05.337 --> 01:17.118
Firebase, Jackson, near the Cambodian border. 
And the last half, the last portion, five months I

01:17.138 --> 01:28.459
spent on top of the mountains that we bought then, 
the Black Virgin just outside of Tainan, inside

01:17.138 --> 01:28.459
Tainan Province. And that's significant because 
it was the only elevation, the only relief spot in

01:29.198 --> 01:42.545
the area, in that whole South Vietnam area. And so 
it was used by strategic communications. And

01:48.858 --> 02:07.442
messages that were broadcast from the Pentagon by 
radio across Europe and retransmitted down

01:48.858 --> 02:07.442
through Turkey came in to the mountains because 
the rest of the area, as I said, was flat. And it was

02:08.263 --> 02:10.305
kind of the key communication point. They were 
relayed through a different series of steps to us,

02:10.325 --> 02:18.696
and then we relayed them down to Saigon to the 
military command headquarters. Okay, Bob? Yeah.

02:20.559 --> 02:25.285
We'll get to more of that, the strategic and the 
location, a little later on in the interview.

02:25.425 --> 02:26.387
Okay. Just, let's see. Okay, so you were, you said 
you were on the Cambodian border, is that correct?

02:32.015 --> 02:32.235
Yeah. Okay, how old were you when you were over 
there? I was 23 when I was drafted. Well, I guess I

02:41.568 --> 02:43.671
was 23 when I was over there. Okay. And you were 
there for, how long was the duration? 11 months. 11

02:47.940 --> 02:50.345
months. And I know you were wounded. How long were 
you in the field and then how long, I guess, on the

02:52.008 --> 02:56.918
hill? I was wounded the first time in the field. I 
had been there probably 45 days in the field, so

03:00.582 --> 03:04.208
I've been in country. It must have been about the 
first or second of November. And then the second

03:11.220 --> 03:16.730
time was the 10th of September.

03:17.451 --> 03:17.631
Okay. Now, what was your rank in... the people that 
you were serving with, fighting with? I was an E-5,

03:25.124 --> 03:40.978
a Bucs sergeant, and when I arrived there, and my 
status was to be a squad sergeant, and after a

03:25.124 --> 03:40.978
series of attritions, people that Zero set of 
countries in a time that expired or were injured

03:41.178 --> 03:53.617
and had to be fed back the wage. When I left, I was 
acting. Okay. And how long were you the platoon

03:55.239 --> 04:01.048
leader then?

04:04.052 --> 04:06.235
It's probably three and a half weeks, almost a 
month. Okay. Um, before we get into the Ho Chi Minh

04:06.980 --> 04:14.834
Trail itself, um, I guess I'm going to hit you with 
this objective question. I might throw one in

04:14.854 --> 04:17.459
mixing with the objective. Before you went, right 
prior to going to Nam, what was your attitude? I

04:22.348 --> 04:27.317
mean, were you, let's say, maybe gun-ho, removed, 
or how, what were you feeling? I wasn't done cold,

04:27.871 --> 04:35.101
but yet I wasn't pacifistic about it. My feelings 
were that we were there because the people who were

04:35.962 --> 04:46.437
making the political decisions and the military 
decisions thought it was in our best interest. and

04:47.243 --> 05:13.183
i believed in the democratic process and uh 
trusted that that that we were there for good

04:47.243 --> 05:13.183
reason okay um okay let's move on to the ho chi minh 
trail and please speak a little louder too okay um

04:47.243 --> 05:13.183
in your initial briefings what were you told that 
the ho chi minh trail was there have been so many

04:47.243 --> 05:13.183
different descriptions of it from being just a 
single path to wide enough areas of flat road where

05:13.518 --> 05:40.302
two trucks could pass abreast and maybe petroleum 
lines feeding into the battlefield and someone

05:13.518 --> 05:40.302
suggested that even they he estimated that 90 000 
troops traveled out a year to the nbn um what were

05:13.518 --> 05:40.302
you told it was in your briefings before you were 
there or were you told uh yeah we were we were told

05:13.518 --> 05:40.302
that it was uh the main communication travel way of 
troop supplies and information from North

05:40.737 --> 05:50.713
Vietnam to South Vietnam. And that pretty much, as 
you've described, is that at some point they were

05:51.200 --> 06:12.742
able to drive trucks up and down it, and at other 
points it was less well-defined and just an area

05:51.200 --> 06:12.742
that infiltration occurred through. Okay. Now, 
is this what you saw or is this what you were told?

06:16.025 --> 06:17.226
This is what I was told. Okay. And how did that 
compare to what you saw when you actually went out

06:17.987 --> 06:20.970
there? Um, I, I know that, uh, the Highway 1 was 
supposed to be, uh, the Ho Chi Minh Trail, and I was

06:22.047 --> 06:38.380
on Highway 1, and, uh, I, I know that we pulled an 
awful lot of ambushes that night, and, uh, that

06:22.047 --> 06:38.380
traffic at night was prohibitive. That all seems 
to me, uh... were required to be indoors during all

06:40.424 --> 06:58.402
the hours of darkness,

06:40.424 --> 06:58.402
and that anyone who was not indoors in the hours of 
darkness was considered to be a North Vietnamese

06:40.424 --> 06:58.402
or a Viet Cong. And I don't know, I never pulled the 
ambush on the highway part, but I do know that down

06:58.422 --> 07:09.013
at the southern end, closer to Cambodia and 
Saigon, where Cambodia

07:09.517 --> 07:15.164
is closest to Saigon, and it was just a trail. Okay. 
And, okay, now Highway 1, that is in Vietnam,

07:18.407 --> 07:21.931
correct? Correct. Okay. They've also described 
it as, well, it overlaps into Cambodia, too. Now,

07:27.238 --> 07:32.464
is that true, or what do you think? Yeah, it does. I 
think that it was down in the area that we were in,

07:34.171 --> 07:47.072
which was about 50 miles from Saigon, northwest of 
Saigon, on the Cambodian border. It was not

07:47.312 --> 07:48.755
Highway 1. Highway 1 ran somewhere. into Cambodia 
and down into the Taigan. But the infiltration,

07:58.511 --> 08:07.843
because of the heavy troop concentration, the 
heavy American troop concentration, the

07:58.511 --> 08:07.843
infiltration through the jungle and less 
well-traveled groups. Okay. And does that

08:08.403 --> 08:11.087
imply... Well, let's see. You went into Cambodia 
also, correct? Correct. The trail was supposed to

08:15.152 --> 08:17.495
be there, too. It depended when they would veer 
into Vietnam and at what point. Is it pretty much

08:21.860 --> 08:24.164
what you find there? A fairly well fortified

08:25.587 --> 08:43.078
North Vietnamese position and evidence of 
massive

08:25.587 --> 08:43.078
troops. Anything else you want to say on that? 
Well, just that prior to the Cambodian invasion,

08:46.936 --> 08:53.942
during the 1970s, Our unit had been operating 
along that border, and we were ordered not to go

08:54.378 --> 09:03.554
into Cambodia. We were told that if we had traded to 
Cambodia, we wouldn't be supported by our

09:03.574 --> 09:15.013
artillery gunners. But that area was 
reconnoitered by the military. five planes at

09:19.117 --> 09:24.386
night using infrared sensing devices. And it was 
also reconned to some degree by American burps,

09:24.626 --> 09:39.471
long range patrols that would wander in to areas 
where there had been sightings. Okay, so

09:40.261 --> 09:56.765
at that time, you knew it was just a matter of time 
before the invasion of Cambodia then. Is that

09:56.785 --> 09:58.287
right? I didn't. I had hoped that that was the case, 
but I didn't know that it was the case. I knew that

10:04.998 --> 10:20.545
the entire time that I was there, and for the period 
of time that the people who had been in my unit when I

10:04.998 --> 10:20.545
arrived, who had been in countries for, say, even 
11 months, they knew that there were Viet Congs in

10:04.998 --> 10:20.545
North Carolina. troops

10:21.318 --> 10:43.382
over there

10:21.318 --> 10:43.382
that

10:21.318 --> 10:43.382
used that area as a staging area, as a hospital 
area, as a fire area, and that we weren't

10:21.318 --> 10:43.382
authorized to get at them. And we didn't really 
know that that is what was going to occur. We

10:44.784 --> 10:49.109
thought that we were going over there, we were 
going to be a small unit, we would draw their fire,

10:44.784 --> 10:49.109
and then the commanders would request special 
permission to send in gunships into Cambodia,

10:44.784 --> 10:49.109
into these areas. But you've got to go in to rescue 
these small units of Americans. That's what we

10:50.410 --> 10:55.138
thought was going on. We hoped that we would be able 
at some point to go in and have a more direct

10:55.258 --> 11:06.337
confrontation because we thought it would 
eliminate a lot of the problems that we

10:55.258 --> 11:06.337
experienced on a day-to-day basis. Okay. Well, 
then moving on to the strategy. What were your

11:10.812 --> 11:18.761
orders and how were you ordered to stop the flow 
specifically? Or have you pretty much covered

11:19.482 --> 11:22.886
that with what you just said? Well, generally we 
were on a circuit destroy mission. We would, if you

11:27.711 --> 11:37.041
would start the day, say at 7 o'clock on any 
morning, we would get ready and have chow and we'd

11:27.711 --> 11:37.041
start to move out through the jungle. We'd spend 
most of the afternoon until about 3, 3.30 in the

11:37.122 --> 11:40.245
afternoon. moving through an area in the jungle 
that had already been targeted by headquarters,

11:40.411 --> 11:50.607
or we had wanted to go to an escape headquarters in 
Google, to go into and look around. And our

11:53.773 --> 12:08.713
objective was if we went in and looked around 
today, we may want to come back that night or the

11:53.773 --> 12:08.713
following night and set up an ambush because we 
thought there was activity. And we would do that,

12:08.733 --> 12:16.744
come back for the heat of the afternoon, try and be 
back in the face of the environment. Generally

12:16.764 --> 12:18.006
preparing ourselves, resting a little bit. 
And... getting

12:18.886 --> 12:45.957
ready

12:18.886 --> 12:45.957
to

12:18.886 --> 12:45.957
go out

12:18.886 --> 12:45.957
on ambush patrol that night then that evening we 
would either go to that area or if we wanted to be a

12:18.886 --> 12:45.957
little more stealthy we'd go to another area that 
we'd reconned today or a couple of days three days

12:18.886 --> 12:45.957
prior and we set up an ambush along the trail 
outside a village wherever we thought that it was

12:18.886 --> 12:45.957
evident or wherever headquarters and 
intelligence and we set up an ambush in hopes to

12:45.937 --> 12:52.185
catch them coming through. Okay, and now this was 
in Cambodia? This was in Vietnam. Okay, close to

12:57.853 --> 12:59.736
the border? Close to the border. Okay, and to what 
degree do you think this strategy worked? At

13:05.603 --> 13:15.657
certain times it was fairly effective because it 
was a big area to cover, and we were in blocking

13:05.603 --> 13:15.657
towards... uh

13:15.991 --> 13:24.533
attempting

13:15.991 --> 13:24.533
to prevent the olympia from sending troops 
through cambodia to the closest point to

13:24.648 --> 13:33.900
Saigon, we were blocking that closest point of 
Cambodia. And it depended, if we'd established a

13:34.300 --> 13:47.617
pattern, they'd recognize that we were basically 
setting up ambushes within a true five-mile area

13:34.300 --> 13:47.617
along the border. It didn't take them very long. 
They'd start going outside that area and

13:48.538 --> 13:51.702
establishing their pipelines, moving their 
troops and flying them. and

13:51.682 --> 14:18.227
once we realized that they pretty much figured out 
that we were ambushed in a particular area, and

13:51.682 --> 14:18.227
that this other area was not being covered by any of 
the American troops, and we pulled in there,

13:51.682 --> 14:18.227
usually at that point, there would be an enormous 
amount of contact for a couple days, and then

13:51.682 --> 14:18.227
they'd figure out some other routes that would fly 
without contact. Okay. Um, Bob, I'd like to pause

14:18.732 --> 14:25.424
at this point and just rewind and make sure 
everything's being recorded here, okay? Good.

14:26.726 --> 14:29.030
Okay, um, Bob, I'll need you to talk a little 
louder. This recording really is not coming

14:29.050 --> 14:31.715
through too well. Okay, I'll try my best. Alright, 
thank you. The enemy has often been described as

14:36.784 --> 14:42.394
being everywhere and nowhere at the same time. 
Now, was there anything that would let you know

14:43.100 --> 14:56.965
whether the usual sniping harassment fire from 
nowhere would remain just that, or was there

14:43.100 --> 14:56.965
something that would tell you sometime that this 
firepower from nowhere would soon be from

14:43.100 --> 14:56.965
everywhere? You know, was there something that 
you could let you know to differentiate between

14:57.987 --> 15:06.002
the usual harassment, or maybe that you were going 
to be in an engagement for a while? No, not really.

15:10.624 --> 15:15.972
You know, a rifle shot in the night is a rifle shot. 
And ordinarily, if you heard one and within three

15:15.992 --> 15:35.398
or four seconds you just hear a barrage of them, it 
pretty generally indicated that you were not up

15:15.992 --> 15:35.398
against a large field unit because in those 
instances where they surrounded us and fired on

15:15.992 --> 15:35.398
us, it was a well-coordinated effort. At exactly 
12 o'clock on one occasion, they tore into us. And I

15:43.476 --> 15:54.933
heard one round, and within a night, probably less 
than within a second, they opened up with machine

15:43.476 --> 15:54.933
guns and mortars, and they were right on us. The 
whole world switched to rock and roll, and

15:54.953 --> 16:00.060
everything around us started to dance. Wow. 
And... That's kind of how they were. They didn't

16:05.371 --> 16:23.914
tie into you unless they were very confident that 
they could destroy you so seriously damaged that

16:05.371 --> 16:23.914
you weren't going to be real successful at any 
retaliation. And then they'd move out of the area

16:23.934 --> 16:28.179
before our gunship or artillery could pin them 
down. That's pretty much the basic, well, Yeah, it

16:31.808 --> 16:34.192
was. And, you know, in those instances where we 
would see them coming, it was extremely effective

16:34.312 --> 16:52.500
because we could either choose to hope that our 
positions would be undetected and let them pass

16:52.801 --> 16:56.307
through us. If, for example, since we operate 
primarily in 8- or 10-net groups, if there were too

16:56.427 --> 17:09.691
many of them, we didn't want to take that much of a 
chance, say if we saw 40 or 50. Or it appears that the

17:09.711 --> 17:16.142
way that they were coming through the wood line out 
onto the rice paddies, that there may well be 40 or

17:09.711 --> 17:16.142
50. We

17:16.713 --> 17:35.055
would just let them go beyond us, be in radio 
communication and have gunships and additional

17:16.713 --> 17:35.055
troops ready and artillery. And then at some point 
when we thought it was advantageous for us, we'd

17:35.075 --> 17:38.178
call in the artillery and try and have the gunships 
who pulled the horizon on them. And then maybe we'd

17:38.198 --> 17:39.700
open up on the conditions that we thought we could 
use. When we saw them, it was a good deal. When they

17:42.509 --> 17:53.345
saw us, and I'm sure that they saw us a lot more than 
we were ever aware of, when they saw

17:42.509 --> 17:53.345
us, they didn't think they could handle us. They 
just let us go. I'd like to move to the technology of

17:54.928 --> 18:06.885
the war, but right before that, do you think that 
you were well-equipped or maybe over-equipped to

17:54.928 --> 18:06.885
get the job done? um in terms of having military 
power we could we were probably

18:07.777 --> 18:32.670
over equipped we could have gotten the job done 
with less military power with with fewer m16s or

18:07.777 --> 18:32.670
you know we didn't need more explosive weapons we 
had we had uh very adequate weapons uh the

18:07.777 --> 18:32.670
technological aspect was certainly on our side 
compared to what they had we generally we

18:07.777 --> 18:32.670
controlled the air And we had long range 
artillery, which up north they had, but they

18:33.038 --> 18:50.385
weren't able to set up very effectively down 
south. And we probably had more sophisticated

18:50.405 --> 18:56.033
communications, which would have played a key 
role. OK. And specifically, did your platoon get

18:56.053 --> 18:59.839
to seeing new technological innovations? Well,

19:00.612 --> 19:16.548
we used the M16, which the Vietnam War started out 
with the M14 as the primary weapon. The M16 wasn't

19:16.568 --> 19:18.773
adopted by the military until some point after 
Vietnam had been going on for a couple of years. We

19:19.681 --> 19:28.584
used the duper, which fires grenades that hit 50 
meters. It was extremely effective. It was like a

19:29.166 --> 19:29.707
big shot gun. It was called duper because when it 
went off, it was a duper. Even that's what it

19:30.970 --> 19:31.632
sounded like. They used whatever weapons

19:31.814 --> 19:43.300
they could capture for us. They also had an 
extremely effective AK. The AK is more of a

19:48.352 --> 19:49.374
long-range weapon than the M4P. The M4P was 
designed to be light, to be maneuverable, and to

19:49.394 --> 19:51.038
quickly pump out. on a cyclical

19:51.710 --> 20:15.384
rate of fire, if you hooked it up in such a way as you 
would a machine gun, the M16 on automatic would

19:51.710 --> 20:15.384
fire 800 to 850 rounds per minute, which is a very 
fast rate of fire. And it's light, and it fires

20:15.405 --> 20:17.928
smaller, and requires lighter ammunition. And 
their AK, however, was more accurate over a

20:17.948 --> 20:20.552
greater distance. Bob, on this recording, I'm 
sure you're making sure that your... I guess your

20:25.763 --> 20:28.347
mouth is in the best position for the receiver. 
Well, I think so. Okay. Just to concentrate on

20:31.071 --> 20:34.536
that, and maybe a little bit louder, too. Okay. 
Okay. Went out on the trail, and I put that in

20:37.080 --> 20:40.045
quotes. I really... Would you agree that there's 
really no specific trail, but just a... a term for

20:45.693 --> 20:48.416
the mass movement that was going on. I agree. Okay. 
Okay, we went out on the trail. Were there any signs

20:52.482 --> 20:56.247
of our other strategies that were being used on the 
trail? For example, we had electronic sensors

20:56.367 --> 21:05.078
and, of course, massive bombing from B-52s and 
then defoliation from Agent Orange. Did you see

21:05.098 --> 21:09.844
any signs of maybe these other strategies? Every 
day, every day, we were constantly concerned with

21:10.398 --> 21:20.556
booby traps. And the majority of the booby traps 
were either mortars or grenades or artillery

21:21.558 --> 21:33.098
rounds which did explode upon impact or were taken 
from overran American units. and they were stuck

21:33.685 --> 21:49.362
in such a way with a trip wire or a device, a grenade 
would be placed underneath an artillery shell,

21:33.685 --> 21:49.362
and O.P. started nosing around the artillery 
shell and moved it. The lieutenant had pulled in

21:51.905 --> 21:56.129
the grenade, and so the handle would flop loose, 
and then the grenade would explode, and it would

21:51.905 --> 21:56.129
cause the artillery shell to explode. You know, 
those kind of ingenious things. Now, are you

21:57.192 --> 22:05.800
saying those were American-made? I would say that 
a majority of booby-trapped devices were

22:06.781 --> 22:19.233
American-made. The North Vietnamese or the VCs 
had rigged other things, too, so that they would

22:19.253 --> 22:24.098
explode upon impact. Or when you happened to pull a 
vine that was connected to the device, you could

22:24.118 --> 22:26.440
pull the handle free from a grenade. In terms of the 
B-52 and some of these other methods, there's an

22:27.162 --> 22:39.482
argument saying that they in actuality were 
ineffective in that they increased the will of the

22:27.162 --> 22:39.482
people to resist. Now, was there any way that you 
could elaborate on that if you were able to witness

22:39.503 --> 22:45.332
that? Is that true? I don't know that they 
increased the will of the people to resist. I think

22:51.543 --> 22:52.444
they... that at various points it will seem to be 
higher and lower. And I really don't know what

22:58.408 --> 23:18.733
effect the B-52 had on Bouchard, other than that 
perhaps the same effect that a Russian plane

22:58.408 --> 23:18.733
cruising down our street might have on us, versus a 
less visible presence. I don't know. Yeah, sort of

23:20.495 --> 23:21.937
a terror factor. Yeah. Yeah. All right, well, 
let's move on to the relationship with your fellow

23:23.123 --> 23:30.556
men there. What do you think about the leadership? 
Well, not really what do you think, but how were

23:35.504 --> 23:42.276
they as far as competency, consistency, and their 
concern for the troops? I think that in general the

23:43.049 --> 23:54.671
leadership, the personnel who comprised the 
leadership were probably extremely competent

23:43.049 --> 23:54.671
people. I think that it's probably fairly well 
discussed and or even documented that there was a

23:54.691 --> 24:03.688
stifling effect. The military hierarchy acted in 
such a way as to stifle true and valid observations

24:06.691 --> 24:35.584
from the lower ranks from the people actually out 
the grunts during the day-to-day combat they

24:06.691 --> 24:35.584
stifled uh and changed and modified the 
information that these people put in and

24:06.691 --> 24:35.584
discouraged them from uh from those above them to 
insist on the truth they weren't able to get the

24:06.691 --> 24:35.584
truth across to the elite And I think the leaders 
wanted the troops who could best fight the war or do

24:36.037 --> 24:45.928
anything, exist on a day-to-day basis with the 
troops. Well, we don't want Colonel so-and-so to

24:46.229 --> 25:07.357
think that we're not performing well, so we're 
going to tell him this or we're going to tell him

24:46.229 --> 25:07.357
that because that's what he wants to hear. There 
are many examples of people in leadership

25:07.377 --> 25:13.565
positions who did not do that, but there does seem 
to be some kind of generalization that's true.

25:13.585 --> 25:15.087
That sounds like the recent Westmoreland case. I 
think that's probably the... the most verified

25:16.351 --> 25:24.983
account of stifling gas. And it hurt us all. It hurt 
us all. Because when I arrived there in September

25:32.654 --> 25:37.060
of 1969, two or three weeks after I was there, I 
began to believe that this was not working. that

25:37.613 --> 25:56.335
what I read in Stars and Stripes was a military 
newspaper which was published on a daily basis in

25:37.613 --> 25:56.335
Vietnam, and we would occasionally get out in the 
fields about a week late and maybe two or three a

25:37.613 --> 25:56.335
week. What they told us was going on, you begin to 
distrust it. You begin to know that a lot of it was

25:59.478 --> 26:00.820
propaganda. You resented the fact that you, the 
grunt, actually conducted the war, had to sort

26:01.357 --> 26:15.895
through this information and wonder, is this true 
or is that true? Because you would see instances of

26:16.035 --> 26:20.721
actions that you were involved in that you didn't 
consider the reporting to be true. Yeah. Wow. And,

26:22.904 --> 26:25.547
well, the overall effect on morale? Yeah, I think 
that the overall effect of the... You know, the...

26:32.002 --> 26:38.709
what are you going to do, send me to Nam attitude. It 
doesn't make any difference attitude. Kind of

26:44.236 --> 26:59.553
came out because we conducted the war with our 
hands tied while we stocked it up with records,

26:44.236 --> 26:59.553
which eventually, which prevented us from 
winning the war. What about You refer to doctoring

27:00.740 --> 27:03.989
up the records. In Phil Caputo's book, A Rumor of 
War, he talks about the whole idea of body count,

27:04.590 --> 27:13.855
that the upper echelons wanted to see results. and 
not necessarily the accurate one. How do you

27:16.831 --> 27:20.595
measure a war that is really hard to measure? This 
wasn't a linear war. There wasn't one solid front.

27:24.179 --> 27:29.285
And the whole emphasis on body count, wasn't that 
sort of demoralizing? Yeah, I think it was. I think

27:30.266 --> 27:35.111
the only way you can really picture a war is the 
morale of the troops in the area. If you get down

27:35.131 --> 27:37.694
with the grunts, what do you think? Are you keeping 
this area clean? What's your attitude? Are you

27:42.786 --> 27:46.998
going out and stopping the infiltration? Are you 
preventing the VT and the communists from

27:47.018 --> 27:49.706
harassing the people in the villages? When you go 
to the villages, when you're passing through the

27:49.726 --> 27:54.439
peasants, are they happy to see you? uh that gives 
you an idea of uh of who's in charge who's in power

27:54.419 --> 28:16.039
but uh simply saying well my predecessor here had 
uh they had uh five uh five an average of five feet

27:54.419 --> 28:16.039
killed per night in this area and uh therefore i as 
battalion commander had better At best, top that,

28:16.019 --> 28:24.552
I'd better have an average of six. You know, that 
kind of attitude doesn't clearly indicate to

28:24.572 --> 28:29.039
anyone. All it does is say, yeah, gee, we're doing 
better than we were before, and therefore we must

28:29.059 --> 28:35.910
be winning. And as a result, there's very little 
serious discussion entertained by higher-ups as

28:35.930 --> 28:43.522
to how to more effectively conduct a war. And that 
hurt me. Well, it's almost all these little

28:45.078 --> 28:57.200
factors that are mutually reciprocating and 
reinforcing to get this whole cycle, which seems

28:45.078 --> 28:57.200
to have a pretty bad effect from what you're 
saying. That's a good point. They did feed into

28:59.003 --> 29:01.688
each other, and they were self-fulfilling 
processes. Once you start lying about how well

29:01.708 --> 29:05.635
you're doing in one particular area... And 
another battalion commander decides that he

29:05.885 --> 29:23.407
better lie to come up with better figures because 
somebody he's competing with for the rank of

29:05.885 --> 29:23.407
colonel, when someone is doing his job in another 
area, is claiming to do it better by these methods.

29:23.427 --> 29:27.252
Pretty soon, nobody really knows what the truth 
is, and I'm afraid that to a large measure that

29:23.427 --> 29:27.252
happens. You know, being squad leader, as you were 
for some while, that made you probably more aware

29:28.902 --> 29:37.295
of some of the command decisions and choice 
decisions. Is there anything that sticks out or

29:37.315 --> 29:49.594
stuck out in your mind at the time as just being 
totally ridiculous and, you know, you would have

29:37.315 --> 29:49.594
recommended something else or not? Well, I can 
think of many instances where we would be briefed

29:50.182 --> 30:12.527
by the, when I first came in country, we'd be 
briefed by the platoon leader who had just come

29:50.182 --> 30:12.527
from a briefing by the captain who had just been 
listening to the radio and the battalion

29:50.182 --> 30:12.527
commander had been telling him what his mission 
for the day is or what his mission for the

30:12.507 --> 30:33.175
weekend, like what areas we moved to, the word 
eventually came on down to us that we would be

30:12.507 --> 30:33.175
telling the men that we would be going to this 
location, these forts, and on the map setting up an

30:12.507 --> 30:33.175
ambush. And we may have known, we may have been by 
that area before. We may have known that where they

30:36.039 --> 30:41.366
were putting us was into an indefensible 
position, or we could better spend our time over

30:36.039 --> 30:41.366
here. But the... The response when we would say, we 
don't want to go here, this is a bad position

30:42.528 --> 30:57.647
because with only 10 of us, we can't defend it. It's 
open for this area. We've had, you know, we know,

30:59.770 --> 31:01.251
we've had contact before. Intelligence says that 
there's this large unit, you know, of BSBs, Viet

31:01.272 --> 31:10.163
Cong, only two miles away over here, and we know 
that they're probably going to infiltrate

31:01.272 --> 31:10.163
through this area. We should really have a company 
or at least a platoon in this area. When

31:12.717 --> 31:22.286
we say those kind of things, generally the 
response was, these are what you're going to

31:12.717 --> 31:22.286
start. You're in the military. This is the way it 
goes. You will do this. Are you saying that at times

31:26.310 --> 31:32.396
you were sent out less than a platoon strength? We 
generally were sent out less than platoon

31:32.416 --> 31:37.321
strength. We generally went out in 8 to 10 man 
units. Wow. You must have been correlated

31:39.680 --> 31:44.947
somewhere. Yeah. The platoon would be out in three 
or four sections of eight to ten men. And we would

31:50.614 --> 31:53.197
know where we were. We would know what frequency we 
were at. And we would be at a certain distance from

32:01.207 --> 32:06.754
each other so that our fire, if we had the fire, that 
it wouldn't catch any of our pieces. and the

32:07.358 --> 32:29.565
attempt

32:07.358 --> 32:29.565
was to maximize,

32:07.358 --> 32:29.565
make as thin a debris as possible over this area so 
that when the fuel pump came in or out, we had the

32:07.358 --> 32:29.565
greatest likelihood of making contact. And then 
the theory was that once we made contact, we'd

32:29.585 --> 32:32.488
assume that they had a larger unit, but we would be 
able to move gunships

32:32.468 --> 32:44.821
would

32:32.468 --> 32:44.821
always be the first to reach us. And then, uh, uh, 
following the gunships was the troop ships and

32:44.841 --> 32:49.726
additional troops. Hmm. And, uh, then we'd rush in 
larger troops that would set up behind them, and we

32:50.606 --> 32:58.675
would try to catch them between our 10-man units 
and the larger troops. Okay. Um, in your platoon,

32:58.935 --> 33:00.537
how big was your platoon? Uh, we were, we probably 
operated generally from 28 to 32 men. That is

33:02.236 --> 33:05.280
somewhat understrength, isn't it? Well, it's 
ideally equal to 40. But it was pretty much the

33:09.165 --> 33:11.409
average. I doubt that we ever had over 32 in any 
time. I wonder if Nixon had started his

33:15.494 --> 33:28.632
decimization, excuse me, problem or solution, 
did that have anything to do with the smaller

33:15.494 --> 33:28.632
numbers or was it just because of lack of troops 
overall? It

33:29.000 --> 33:48.481
was because

33:29.000 --> 33:48.481
of lack of troops overall. People were injured. 
People would be wounded. People would develop

33:51.264 --> 33:57.471
foot rots, would catch malaria, and they'd have to 
go back into the rear and possibly went to the

33:51.264 --> 33:57.471
hospital in Saigon or Tokyo, or else they were 
going on leave, or their time in the country had

33:51.264 --> 33:57.471
expired, or they would have come in to get out of the 
field. so that we have a better job. Are you

34:00.855 --> 34:02.497
familiar with the term bragging? Yes. Was that 
evident? I know it increased as the anti-war

34:05.960 --> 34:12.046
movement increased back on the home front, but was 
that a present? Did you see that, or did that happen

34:12.746 --> 34:15.829
while you were there? Any incidents? Well, I 
really am not certain. There... A

34:26.324 --> 34:45.911
little louder,

34:26.324 --> 34:45.911
please. Mm-hmm. had

34:46.439 --> 35:10.513
decided that

34:46.439 --> 35:10.513
he knew everything about

34:46.439 --> 35:10.513
the war and how to be a platoon leader before he 
arrived there, and he wouldn't listen to any of the

34:46.439 --> 35:10.513
troops who'd been around a while, the message was 
given to him that that is not a healthy way to go. And

35:10.533 --> 35:12.075
he was injured at one point, but it's not entirely 
clear Whether it was Charlie's fire or us. Okay.

35:19.650 --> 35:24.139
Within your platoon, Bob, was there an overriding 
sense of camaraderie? Or was there more of a... Did

35:24.620 --> 35:31.414
the soldiers tend to form groups, even, you know, 
on the off-patrol duty time? There was, groups

35:31.630 --> 35:40.639
were formed, but there was an overriding sense of 
camaraderie. That cut through everything. You

35:43.762 --> 35:53.892
knew that you had to be on your best terms, that you 
had to trust everyone that was around you, and they

35:43.762 --> 35:53.892
had to depend on you. And it was my experience that 
that was by far and away the overriding attitude.

35:57.275 --> 36:00.338
Did this transcend any of the perhaps racist 
issues that were still a problem in the U.S. during

36:01.786 --> 36:07.053
the time. Was there much racism that you saw within 
the platoons and in the Army in general? Within the

36:12.961 --> 36:16.486
Army in general, I thought there was a great deal of 
racism. Within the platoons, within the company,

36:16.506 --> 36:27.000
out in the field, I really can't think of an 
incident where it was an issue. But when we came

36:27.689 --> 36:44.597
back in to stand down after being out in the field 
for about 52 days, there were some name-calling

36:27.689 --> 36:44.597
and shoving based on race. Wow. But once back in 
Tennessee, these were not between the members of a

36:46.140 --> 36:49.525
similar platoon. They were between members of 
different platoons. But out in the field, it never

36:51.196 --> 37:00.907
surfaced, and in our platoon, it was never an issue 
during the time I was there. Okay. Let's see here.

37:02.348 --> 37:05.352
Now, you were sent after the Tet Offenses. That's 
right. Okay, and you knew that the anti-war

37:07.514 --> 37:17.305
movement was already in process, and the time you 
left, was that any effect on the troops as far as

37:07.514 --> 37:17.305
morale? Or did you even hear much of it once you were 
out there, of the growing anti-war movement?

37:23.628 --> 37:33.165
Well, we would hear about it because everyone, you 
know, received a lot of letters. And my aunt, Tita,

37:33.185 --> 37:35.108
had a subscription of the Minneapolis Star that 
said, And

37:35.948 --> 37:54.113
so about

37:35.948 --> 37:54.113
once every 10 days or so, I would leave either 10 
papers, and I'd read about it there. And the Stars

37:54.133 --> 37:56.697
and Stripes, the military magazine, paper, 
sailing paper in Vietnam, downplayed it. The

37:56.717 --> 37:58.760
radio station downplayed it or brought up absurd 
circumstances that would occur. It wasn't... To

37:59.793 --> 38:19.149
me personally,

37:59.793 --> 38:19.149
and to those in

37:59.793 --> 38:19.149
my squad and platoon that I was closest to, I don't 
really think we were demoralized exactly. I think

38:19.169 --> 38:21.253
a lot of the general attitude was that we weren't 
getting the job done. And the reason we weren't

38:21.273 --> 38:23.016
getting the job done is because we couldn't go into 
Cambodia. And

38:23.468 --> 38:41.550
we couldn't go up north. If we could go up north, if 
we wanted

38:41.570 --> 38:48.979
to win the war, we could have bombed the geysers, 
bombed the industrial centers, bombed the supply

38:41.570 --> 38:48.979
of troops coming from North Vietnamese troops 
coming down south. And we could have done it. It

38:49.540 --> 38:51.442
would have been eradicating a great deal of North 
Vietnamese and many more South Vietnamese. But we

38:51.462 --> 38:52.243
could have won the war that way. I'm still sticking 
with the morale theme. Do you think the whole

38:57.625 --> 39:11.582
policy of search and destroy, with its 
implication that eventually everyone was going

38:57.625 --> 39:11.582
to have to assume that point position, do you 
think, did that sort of have a negative effect in

38:57.625 --> 39:11.582
itself on the troop morale? Just knowing that 
you're out there mainly to draw fire, if you're out

39:13.064 --> 39:17.529
there on the point. And hopefully you will survive 
that and be able to fire back.

39:25.197 --> 39:28.881
It did. It

39:28.901 --> 39:34.708
did. But,

39:34.728 --> 39:48.503
you know, it did because we knew that there existed 
a large number of sanctuaries in Cambodia and

39:34.728 --> 39:48.503
North Vietnam that we couldn't go after. And at the 
point where we knew that we couldn't go after and

39:48.523 --> 39:53.989
conduct the war, at that point it seemed so 
treacherous and foolhardy for us to be there and

39:48.523 --> 39:53.989
for the military to be using our bodies in this way 
of drawing fire so that we could... We

39:54.627 --> 40:18.913
gained

39:54.627 --> 40:18.913
body count

39:54.627 --> 40:18.913
when very few of the people in my platoon and no one 
in my original squad believed that we would ever

39:54.627 --> 40:18.913
win the war, that we would do anything other than, 
we never believed that the South Vietnamese would

39:54.627 --> 40:18.913
defend themselves against the North Vietnamese. 
We didn't think they were capable. And we never

40:19.633 --> 40:21.175
believed that anything other than withdrawal by 
American forces would occur down the road. And

40:25.842 --> 40:37.930
that was demoralizing because it seems foolish to 
take the chance on risking our lives when our real

40:25.842 --> 40:37.930
objective was not to win the war. Yeah, so that sign 
is probably... the key morale demoralizer? I

40:43.549 --> 40:46.213
think it was. I think it was the primary attitude of 
most American GIs. Certainly of the American GIs

40:52.242 --> 40:55.586
that I encountered. You mentioned the 
Vietnamese. Now, did you fight alongside with

40:57.048 --> 40:59.532
Arvin? We did. We had, it was called a sister 
company of ours, who had a base about a quarter of a

41:01.288 --> 41:16.230
mile away from our base. And because they would 
indiscriminately get fire up, fire toward our

41:16.250 --> 41:24.642
base, thinking that there were being seen between 
our base and theirs. uh

41:24.841 --> 41:45.178
we had to had to have them move farther away and uh it 
was it was interesting because they had uh their

41:24.841 --> 41:45.178
wives and uh some of their families that would live 
with them in this state and uh they pulled they

41:24.841 --> 41:45.178
seemed to pull very few ambush controls that night

41:49.158 --> 42:14.457
aggressive

41:49.158 --> 42:14.457
they wanted to be as close to us as they could they 
did very little and when we we'd be out in the jungle

41:49.158 --> 42:14.457
sometimes and we'd be able to watch them at a 
distance across the clearing through a starlight

41:49.158 --> 42:14.457
scope at night they'd be uh they'd be either 
disoriented or unaware that we were there and uh

41:49.158 --> 42:14.457
and should have been aware that we were there 
because uh you know

42:19.567 --> 42:38.861
They,

42:19.567 --> 42:38.861
to a certain degree, I can appreciate their 
attitude. They've been at war forever with most of

42:38.881 --> 42:40.504
these people throughout their lifetimes. And war 
was something that they were trying to survive.

42:41.646 --> 42:42.467
And they weren't as aggressive as troops. They 
weren't as dependable. And they didn't believe

42:43.048 --> 42:44.190
that they would ever win the war. That if the world 
was going to be won, it was going to be won by us. Do

42:49.078 --> 42:50.140
you think they really cared? I don't know whether 
they... I think... I mean, which side won? Yeah, I

42:57.856 --> 42:59.279
don't know. That's... I don't know how to answer 
that. Oh, well, yeah. I guess I should move on from

43:03.227 --> 43:04.931
that anyway. That's a very good question. Okay. 
Now, how about with your relationship with the

43:08.534 --> 43:13.106
Vietnamese civilians? Did you encounter them 
frequently? Can I answer the previous question by

43:15.031 --> 43:21.147
saying that, yes, I think they cared, and they 
wanted their side, our side, to win. But they

43:21.835 --> 43:40.693
decided that from having been at war all their 
life, that they were better off to be a survivor in a

43:21.835 --> 43:40.693
communist regime than they were to be a dead 
capitalist or dead in a more ideal situation.

43:40.713 --> 43:40.813
Okay. Would you give me a brief on that last 
question again? Sure. Okay. I want to move to your

43:43.616 --> 43:48.080
relationship with the Vietnamese people 
themselves, civilians in the area. Did you have

43:48.200 --> 43:49.641
frequent encounters? We had frequent 
encounters. Because

43:52.345 --> 44:16.694
we would come up and

43:52.345 --> 44:16.694
look through what were kind of like farmhouses, 
their idea of farmhouses, particularly out

43:52.345 --> 44:16.694
towards the border. There were few and far 
between. We'd try to get information out of them.

44:18.176 --> 44:18.596
Have you seen anyone? We would get someone in a 
village, for example, a village of maybe 30 huts

44:18.616 --> 44:21.260
where they farmed the immediate rice paddy area. 
One or two would... would

44:22.400 --> 44:41.820
say, the BC come here, they take our rights, they 
came two nights

44:22.400 --> 44:41.820
ago, they will come again tomorrow night. And we 
would get information that way, and generally it

44:41.840 --> 44:43.782
was very accurate. But I think that by and large, 
because the BC would only have to make their

44:43.802 --> 44:50.989
presence known about once every, you know, 
periodically, once every couple of months,

44:43.802 --> 44:50.989
they'd come in and they'd execute whoever it was 
they thought was ratting them. and they had a more

44:51.307 --> 45:13.675
effective hold over the Harkins mine to the BFB and 
the South BFB troops who would come in

44:51.307 --> 45:13.675
occasionally and probably terrorize it to a 
degree too, but weren't able to protect it that

44:51.307 --> 45:13.675
night. Okay, so I'm gonna take a pause here. I need 
to flip the tape too. I'd like to get back to the

45:16.038 --> 45:17.760
Harkins mine that you just mentioned. Okay. So 
I'll shut this off and flip the tape. Okay.
