WEBVTT

00:04.942 --> 00:07.387
Okay, we're talking about the MetroCom system. We 
will be expanding our database to incorporate all

00:07.407 --> 00:18.769
the demographic information that we need for the 
city, integrate the census data, the dime file.

00:20.131 --> 00:24.199
Two things that we do here that are very important 
that require our use of the computer. is we're

00:25.023 --> 00:50.878
responsible for the council districts and 
redistricting our city charter requires that we

00:25.023 --> 00:50.878
redistrict every time that we annex and so and at 
least every election year and of course every two

00:25.023 --> 00:50.878
years we have to do redistricting or at least 
evaluate the city for redistricting and then

00:25.023 --> 00:50.878
we're responsible for the annexations so that we 
have to do studies on both areas and the computer

00:25.023 --> 00:50.878
will help us quite a bit The Texas laws regarding 
annexation are, I understand, pretty good

00:52.613 --> 01:00.970
compared to some states. and i gather that's 
helped houston in the past in terms of its suburbs

01:01.743 --> 01:27.362
and the suburban growth wanted to incorporate and 
taking advantage of the city's resources without

01:01.743 --> 01:27.362
paying taxes to the city yes i think probably we 
have the best set of annexation laws in the country

01:01.743 --> 01:27.362
from a municipality's point of view and at this 
last session of the legislature we had to beat back

01:28.203 --> 01:36.450
about three attempts to reduce our authority in 
the extraterritorial jurisdiction and our

01:28.203 --> 01:36.450
annexation authority. For example, there was a 
proposal to have the citizens vote before they

01:36.470 --> 01:42.315
could be annexed. There was another proposal that 
we had to announce annexations a year and another

01:42.936 --> 01:48.220
two years ahead of time. So all those things we 
finally were able to defeat.

01:55.967 --> 01:57.568
Now, Ephraim, can we Now I'll turn to the major 
effort of the department, the major new effort,

01:57.818 --> 02:08.633
which is the comprehensive plan that has received 
so much recent publicity. Can you describe how

02:09.173 --> 02:13.379
this effort came into being? Who is responsible 
for pushing for a comprehensive plan? And what the

02:18.967 --> 02:21.210
goal of the plan is? And is it going to be a 
long-range, general plan for development of the

02:26.320 --> 02:29.305
city? Or is it going to be different than what we 
think of as the classical model of a comprehensive

02:30.006 --> 02:34.994
plan? Well, we have developed a Houston solution 
to the planning process. And it took me about six

02:41.705 --> 02:50.539
months after I arrived here to develop the 
methodology by which we could do a comprehensive

02:50.738 --> 02:52.640
plan for the city of Houston. And it will not be a 
comprehensive plan in the traditional sense. The

02:56.865 --> 03:05.775
need for a planning document is evident.

03:09.278 --> 03:17.768
The old, the term that I keep repeating time and 
time again is in the past, Houston has reacted to

03:09.278 --> 03:17.768
growth and now we're going to begin to plan for 
growth. Because of our lack of land use controls,

03:20.945 --> 03:28.957
it is very difficult to come up with a 
comprehensive plan that would then be

03:20.945 --> 03:28.957
implementable. So what we have developed is a 
different approach

03:30.219 --> 03:44.681
and use public improvements as the carrot to bring 
about growth as we would like to see it occur. So

03:44.701 --> 03:48.066
that the planning process is going to feed right 
into our CAPITAL IMPROVEMENTS PLAN. AND IN THAT

03:51.943 --> 04:11.440
FASHION, WITH THE PLAN CONTROLLING WHERE THE 
CAPITAL IMPROVEMENTS ARE GOING TO GO, THEN WE

03:51.943 --> 04:11.440
THINK THAT THE CAPITAL IMPROVEMENTS WOULD 
EVENTUALLY, ONCE WE HAVE CAUGHT UP WITH OUR

03:51.943 --> 04:11.440
BACKLOG AND WE'RE BEHIND TIMES IN IMPROVEMENTS, 
BUT WE THINK BY 1994 WE WILL BE CAUGHT UP. WE WILL

04:12.241 --> 04:16.905
THEN BE ABLE TO BEGIN TO CONSTRUCT FACILITIES AND 
PROJECT where growth is going to occur and

04:18.235 --> 04:22.582
construct the support system for that growth. And 
once that support system exists, then it should

04:23.183 --> 04:27.811
attract the growth into those areas. That's seven 
years away. Yes, it's seven years away. We have a

04:32.239 --> 04:38.309
capital improvements plan now that covers us 
through 1992, a five-year capital improvements

04:32.239 --> 04:38.309
plan. And we think the planning process we're 
embarking on now will take us at least four years.

04:44.510 --> 04:56.762
So that the situation that we find ourselves in is 
this, that not only are we planning for Houston and

04:44.510 --> 04:56.762
the 600 square miles of Houston, but also the 1,400 
square miles of UTJ. How do you relate to HGAC on

04:56.802 --> 04:59.484
this? There is the only interaction that we have 
with HGAC has to do with transportation planning

05:01.826 --> 05:14.078
because they are the transportation group for the 
area. And so we work with them on major

05:14.783 --> 05:22.494
transportation improvements, et cetera. But 
other than that, the HGAC and the other, there's

05:22.514 --> 05:29.744
one other area that we interrelate, and that is in 
population estimation. We have formed one

05:30.345 --> 05:39.799
central group here, a central task force, under 
the coordination of HGAC to develop all growth

05:30.345 --> 05:39.799
estimates. And so that metro, the city, all the 
utilities, HGAC, everyone is using the same

05:44.365 --> 05:47.950
population projection. Well, in that respect, 
you have diverged from state government. They use

05:53.037 --> 05:53.738
two.

05:58.785 --> 06:11.082
So what I was trying to do is come up recognizing 
that starting from point zero and trying to plan

05:58.785 --> 06:11.082
2,000 square miles, which is an area larger than 
the state of Delaware, as the planning magazine

05:58.785 --> 06:11.082
said last time, I thought that the traditional 
concept of preparing a comprehensive plan for the

06:11.483 --> 06:25.221
entire area and then implement

06:11.483 --> 06:25.221
smaller segments of it into neighborhood plans 
and smaller areas was not feasible.

06:28.084 --> 06:34.653
From taking the overall look first and then coming 
down into more specific areas. So in effect, we're

06:35.013 --> 06:37.236
going to do it the opposite way. We have developed, 
first of all, As you can imagine, in 2,000 square

06:41.032 --> 06:48.220
miles, there are many separate characteristics 
in the various areas. And so we've developed two

06:49.001 --> 06:52.945
major characteristics that we're going to deal 
with. One is the inner city neighborhoods, and one

06:52.965 --> 06:59.012
is what we would consider stable neighborhoods 
and growth areas. And so we've divided our

07:00.113 --> 07:05.419
planning system into something that we call 
neighborhood planning and sector planning.

07:06.293 --> 07:08.995
Because went through that. So you understand the 
difference between the two techniques. Right.

07:12.999 --> 07:19.204
And so that right now, we're looking at 25 
neighborhood plans and 23 sector plans. And then

07:20.785 --> 07:28.432
we will begin to aggregate them first into 
quadrant plans and eventually into what I guess

07:20.785 --> 07:28.432
you could call a comprehensive plan. But I would 
more likely call an executive summary, a summary

07:28.472 --> 07:36.098
of what we find in these 48 documents. And these 
documents are going to be rather substantial

07:36.398 --> 07:53.560
documents because they will contain everything 
on that neighborhood, including a projection as

07:36.398 --> 07:53.560
to what public improvements are going to be 
required over a 10 or at least a 10-year period in

07:36.398 --> 07:53.560
the future. And so that is the process we're 
embarking in. We're ensuring, first of all, that

07:55.683 --> 08:05.055
there is coordination by implementing what we 
call a staff task force that not only includes the

08:05.457 --> 08:24.821
various departments of the city, but also the many 
other multiple agencies, the Harris County Flood

08:05.457 --> 08:24.821
Control District, the Turnpike Authority, the 
school districts, Metro, all the other agencies

08:05.457 --> 08:24.821
that would have some input into the planning 
process. And the big task force is they will have a

08:25.622 --> 08:30.688
specific assignment, and they will be sun-setted 
automatically when they finish the task. Yes,

08:34.023 --> 08:51.189
when the planning process is complete, we would 
expect these task forces to basically

08:34.023 --> 08:51.189
run out of work, although there will be an update 
process that will continue to go on, and we may have

08:34.023 --> 08:51.189
some need for at least a staff task force. The other 
task force that we're creating is what we call a

08:51.690 --> 09:00.203
TAC, T-A-C, the Technical Advisory Committee, 
and that provides the input from the outside the

09:00.537 --> 09:01.538
government, etc. We have representatives of all 
the major organizations, American Institute of

09:02.199 --> 09:29.245
Architects, American Planning Association, 
Apartment Association, the Builders

09:02.199 --> 09:29.245
Association,

09:02.199 --> 09:29.245
BOMA, the Building Owners and Managers 
Association, NAIOP,

09:02.199 --> 09:29.245
National Association of Office and Industrial 
Parks, all these various special interest groups

09:02.199 --> 09:29.245
form a technical advisory committee that will 
also provide us some input into the plans. That is

09:33.166 --> 09:34.087
neighborhoods. The neighborhoods will be 
represented in two ways. Our technical advisory

09:37.972 --> 09:52.109
committee contains overall citywide 
neighborhood representation, plus there will be

09:37.972 --> 09:52.109
local representatives of specific 
neighborhoods when covering their specific area

09:37.972 --> 09:52.109
when it's being planned. Is there any formal 
procedure for the selection of those people? The

09:58.823 --> 10:07.232
Planning Policy Manual, which has been approved 
by the Planning Commission, establishes the

09:58.823 --> 10:07.232
composition of the organizations that would be 
represented. We merely ask the organizations

10:08.614 --> 10:12.618
then to give us their representatives. We ask for a 
representative and two alternates. And so

10:17.283 --> 10:22.489
yesterday, for example, we met with the staff task 
force and the TAC. We had over 100 people here. And

10:24.931 --> 10:26.653
we briefed them on the process, so they understand 
the process and what their role will be in this

10:27.342 --> 10:31.610
process.

10:35.537 --> 10:35.877
Good luck. Well... It sounds like a monumental 
job. I think it's a major undertaking and We have

10:46.276 --> 10:50.460
received the support of every major organization 
in the city except one. The Houston Board of

10:50.520 --> 10:56.586
Realtors has refused to support the process even 
though they have provided members to the TAC. They

10:56.746 --> 10:58.287
did want to be represented for the TAC. But every 
other organization, the Chamber of Commerce, the

10:58.968 --> 11:07.656
Builders Association, Pardon Association, all 
these groups have chosen to support the process.

11:07.756 --> 11:12.100
So we feel that that's a big step already in 
assuring that it's going to happen. How did

11:12.881 --> 11:15.203
this... project gap started? Who pressed the 
start button for it? Well, of course, when I

11:21.266 --> 11:26.511
arrived here, the mayor gave me three major tasks 
he wanted me to accomplish. One was to initiate a

11:27.051 --> 11:31.615
planning process, but she didn't define what 
planning process. Two, the initiation of

11:31.755 --> 11:37.900
revitalization in the inner city. And three was to 
initiate public-private partnerships.

11:46.013 --> 11:46.654
throughout the city. Up until now, the city, or up 
until then, the city and the building community

11:47.917 --> 11:54.449
and the development community had basically been 
antagonists. And the idea was to keep the city down

11:55.871 --> 12:02.283
as ineffective as possible in controlling what 
was happening. She wanted partnerships to be

12:02.925 --> 12:05.109
established. And so in implementing the planning 
side of it, I began to try and devise a method by

12:09.419 --> 12:25.517
which we could eventually get to a comprehensive 
plan, recognizing that without land use

12:09.419 --> 12:25.517
controls, the traditional planning system where 
you develop a comprehensive plan, which is then

12:09.419 --> 12:25.517
implemented by a zoning plan or something like 
that, was impossible. So we have looked at this

12:26.418 --> 12:30.042
opposite approach of using the public 
improvements. And the CIP process says that

12:31.084 --> 12:34.127
projects that appear on the comprehensive plan 
will be given priority over other projects. So it

12:39.556 --> 12:51.086
gives us a mechanism by which people have now come 
forward and want to participate in the process

12:39.556 --> 12:51.086
because they want their particular areas to be 
included and receive their fair share of

12:39.556 --> 12:51.086
improvements. Ephraim, in the private sector, 
has there been any discussion about the use of

12:53.328 --> 13:03.878
performance standards rather than zoning? Yes, 
we've had a lot of discussions. Two particular

13:09.103 --> 13:12.047
groups that are working on these. As we do the 
master plans that we're talking about, the

13:12.247 --> 13:22.941
comprehensive plans, one of the planning areas 
that we're going to do in the sector is going to be

13:12.247 --> 13:22.941
the downtown. Now, this sector plan has the full 
support of the private sector. and particularly

13:31.583 --> 13:35.307
of an organization called Central Houston 
Incorporated. Bob Urie is the head of it, which is

13:35.467 --> 13:45.876
the organization of all the major property owners 
and corporations downtown. And so the big

13:47.278 --> 14:01.371
question that has come up in that area, plus the 
Galleria area where a planning process is also

13:47.278 --> 14:01.371
going to be done, is how are we going to ensure that, 
what incentives can we give to people to, assure

14:02.515 --> 14:25.975
ourselves that they would follow the plan well the 
answer is right now you don't can't give any

14:02.515 --> 14:25.975
because any uh incentives because right now you 
don't have any controls so therefore there can be

14:02.515 --> 14:25.975
no incentives so they have already initiated a 
study in working with this department on the full

14:02.515 --> 14:25.975
range of development controls that are used in 
other cities all the way from the San

14:26.647 --> 14:43.346
Francisco-New York controls to the 
performance-type controls, with the idea of what

14:26.647 --> 14:43.346
is the national standard right now, or state of the 
art, and began to look at it from those areas. We are

14:43.947 --> 14:50.714
embarking already on our first major effort on an 
off-street parking ordinance. Off-street

14:52.556 --> 14:55.860
parking right now seems kind of innocuous in that 
Most cities have included that in their zoning

14:56.161 --> 15:01.147
ordinance or some other thing. But we're looking 
at it as a major way of controlling land use because

15:01.748 --> 15:20.353
what is going to happen, particularly in the older 
areas of the city, the residential areas, without

15:01.748 --> 15:20.353
deed restrictions, where someone could come in 
and just take a residence and convert it to a

15:01.748 --> 15:20.353
restaurant, for example, or office space. Now our 
off-street parking ordinance is going to say,

15:21.875 --> 15:26.100
well, if you're going to run a restaurant there, 
you're going to have to provide an off-street

15:26.435 --> 15:30.140
parking space for every four seats. Or if you're 
going to want an office, you need an off-street

15:30.321 --> 15:37.271
parking space for each 200 square feet of office 
space. So now that person just can't come in and

15:37.291 --> 15:45.683
take a house in the middle of the road and convert it 
to that because he won't have the adequate

15:37.291 --> 15:45.683
parking. And so in effect, then we have limited the 
use of that space to a space that can meet the

15:52.642 --> 15:59.894
off-street parking requirements, which is 
probably going to be residential, because we only

15:52.642 --> 15:59.894
require two off-street parking spaces for 
residents. So that will begin to control parking.

16:03.821 --> 16:07.828
In the modern buildings in Houston, parking is not 
a problem, because lenders have controlled that.

16:07.868 --> 16:11.815
And we find that most buildings either meet or 
exceed ULI standards. But it'll be in the older

16:12.402 --> 16:25.256
areas of the city where we're getting the 
complaints about restaurants moving into

16:12.402 --> 16:25.256
neighborhoods, clubs, so forth, and creating 
parking problems for the residents because the

16:12.402 --> 16:25.256
streets will be full of the clients. And so 
off-street parking ordinance by itself will

16:26.337 --> 16:32.343
begin to correct some of these things. But we look 
at a series of controls that will be basically

16:42.237 --> 16:44.881
based along the line of performance zoning.

16:49.087 --> 16:49.527
Okay.

16:53.032 --> 16:57.719
Then the procedure will, of course, follow 
standard state law procedure in terms of

16:53.032 --> 16:57.719
adoption. Yes. I'm going to mention something, is 
that Houston

17:01.324 --> 17:10.978
has a whole body of law that applies only to 
Houston. State law. State law that applies only to

17:14.420 --> 17:21.028
Houston and recognizes our unique position as 
being unzoned. For example, we have been able to

17:21.869 --> 17:39.852
get extensive legislation on deed restrictions, 
a reinstatement of deed restrictions, extension

17:21.869 --> 17:39.852
of deed restrictions, initiation of new deed 
restrictions, all made a matter of state law so

17:21.869 --> 17:39.852
that you can use those mechanisms to control land 
use. Also, we didn't have any development

17:41.030 --> 17:46.537
controls in legal form until 1983. Prior to that 
time, all standards for plant development, plant

17:46.877 --> 17:57.690
preparation, just existed as policies of the 
department and had no legal basis. In 1983, when

17:58.692 --> 18:06.701
the city passed its development ordinance, we 
were confronted with a situation that anything

17:58.692 --> 18:06.701
prior to 1983 was basically grandfathered. If you 
didn't need to subdivide to construct something,

18:11.219 --> 18:13.001
You were grandfathered. And so we developed what 
we called a development plan. And that was a plan

18:17.805 --> 18:25.933
that would be used in those instances where you 
needed a building permit, but a subdivision plan

18:17.805 --> 18:25.933
was not appropriate according to state law. And 
you had a 25-acre tract of land, and you were going

18:26.654 --> 18:30.057
to build a shopping center. Under state law, you 
don't have to submit a subdivision plan because

18:30.077 --> 18:33.761
you're not dividing land. Therefore, the 
development could proceed without oversight of

18:34.441 --> 18:38.425
the planning commission. Well, we developed a 
development plan in Houston that any time that you

18:39.029 --> 18:55.527
are building a new building or modifying an 
existing building such as you enlarge its size,

18:39.029 --> 18:55.527
its footprint, you then have to submit a 
development plan that will bring you under the new

18:39.029 --> 18:55.527
controls. And in 1985, we had the development plan 
concept codified under state law as applicable

19:05.337 --> 19:06.739
only to Houston. And in 1987, the current session 
of legislature, we went one step further and gave

19:06.939 --> 19:19.975
it a development plan, the same recognition as a 
subdivision plan, for the dedication of right of

19:06.939 --> 19:19.975
way, for filing in the county clerk's office, et 
cetera. So now we have two types of plans in

19:19.995 --> 19:23.399
Houston. And that's something peculiar to 
Houston, but meets the need that we have here of

19:23.419 --> 19:34.112
bringing in all development that occurred before 
1983 under our current controls. In working

19:36.067 --> 19:53.071
through your sector plans, you mentioned that 
this will be coordinated by a task force, or that it

19:36.067 --> 19:53.071
will be assisted by a task force. Yes. It will be 
functionally oriented people, experts. But

19:58.499 --> 20:05.989
you'll also, I presume, have a regular planning 
staff person. assigned to each of these sectors as

20:07.083 --> 20:32.290
they move through to their own development plans 
to coordinate it with the central office here so

20:07.083 --> 20:32.290
that they can be provided with advice regarding 
any overall considerations that the planning

20:07.083 --> 20:32.290
department has for that particular area of the 
city so that you won't be handed something that you

20:07.083 --> 20:32.290
can't use. No. Actually, we will prepare the plans 
here. The neighborhood planning process is going

20:35.618 --> 20:41.684
to be handled by our neighborhood planning 
division. The sector planning process is going to

20:41.704 --> 20:48.151
be handled by the comprehensive planning 
division. I see. Who's heading up the

20:49.633 --> 20:52.616
neighborhood planning division now? Paulette 
Wagner. I think that's the person that Roberta

20:56.460 --> 20:58.782
told you to interview. Yes. Okay. Okay. And so in 
each of those divisions, there are planners

21:03.089 --> 21:13.784
assigned

21:03.089 --> 21:13.784
in such numbers that we can assign a planner to each 
plan. And that planner then will have the

21:14.886 --> 21:18.251
responsibility of carrying that plan all the way 
through. The task force and the technical

21:18.972 --> 21:23.158
advisory committee are there to review his work 
and provide him information, ensure that we're

21:23.695 --> 21:32.744
not committing, for example, Harris County flood 
control to something that they don't plan to do. We

21:33.785 --> 21:49.560
have a water plan, master water plan, master 
wastewater plan, ensure that these technical

21:33.785 --> 21:49.560
people understand what's going in the plan and 
that we can accomplish what the plan will call for.

21:50.340 --> 21:53.263
We want this to be a plan that is When we develop a 
10-year strategy or a year 2000 strategy, that the

21:54.188 --> 22:03.198
things that are going to this plan will be doable in 
that period of time. And so to a certain extent,

22:03.218 --> 22:11.147
these plans are going to be proactive plans 
because we've had the participation and the

22:03.218 --> 22:11.147
cooperation of all these various city 
departments. They will then know what the plan

22:11.608 --> 22:15.352
calls for their departments to do. And we would 
then expect them to be able to carry out what the

22:15.372 --> 22:20.778
plan commits them to do. If they don't have the 
ability of doing it, then they need to tell us at the

22:22.640 --> 22:29.287
planning stage so that we can iron that out. And you 
say that this process will probably take five

22:29.307 --> 22:33.171
years? Well, we're talking about a four-year 
process. Individual plans will probably take us

22:36.615 --> 22:51.550
about eight months each to do because there are 
three public hearings set up and a process by which

22:36.615 --> 22:51.550
eventually the city council will approve each 
plan to ensure that everyone recognizes that this

22:36.615 --> 22:51.550
is an official process. official plan. Will these 
be adopted separately by the Council? Yes, they

22:59.305 --> 23:03.852
will be adopted separately and the Planning 
Commission will adopt them separately and refer

22:59.305 --> 23:03.852
them to City Council. Will they be published 
separately? Yes, we're calling our operation the

23:07.077 --> 23:10.663
Compendium of Plans. So we figured that we're 
going to have a library that's going to have 51

23:11.203 --> 23:17.453
documents. Almost one. 53 documents, isn't it? 
One for each week of the year. Yeah. 48 of these

23:24.227 --> 23:30.214
documents are going to be either neighborhood or 
sector plans, 23 sector and 25 neighborhoods.

23:30.234 --> 23:36.542
Then we will have four quadrant summaries, and 
then we will have the overall summary. And we're

23:36.562 --> 23:48.216
planning, for example, to distribute these by 
having people subscribe, like planning firms and

23:36.562 --> 23:48.216
development firms to subscribe so they would get 
the plans as they come off the assembly line and uh

23:49.057 --> 24:00.754
and then we get them periodically and then we can 
also make them available individually bound so

23:49.057 --> 24:00.754
that specific neighborhoods can get copies of 
their own plan the uh I believe right now with our

24:03.552 --> 24:12.525
staffing that we probably have the capability of 
doing four or five sector plans and four or five

24:03.552 --> 24:12.525
neighborhood plans simultaneously. So even 
though the whole process will take us four years,

24:13.486 --> 24:21.477
there will be plans coming off the assembly line 
after eight months. on a continuous basis during

24:21.743 --> 24:24.025
that period of time. So it will be a gradual 
process. And that's another reason for using this

24:26.508 --> 24:37.379
building block approach, is that we will have 
usable documents early in the process without

24:26.508 --> 24:37.379
having to wait five years before we had something 
that we could use. Well, that's an advantage

24:37.399 --> 24:39.761
politically, I'm sure.

24:42.404 --> 24:51.193
At the end of this, after everything has been 
adopted, then you're presumably in planner's

24:42.404 --> 24:51.193
heaven. What will life be like after adoption of 
plans? Well, one of the things we, particularly

24:55.007 --> 24:59.572
the sector plans, we figure are going to undergo 
considerable revision. So we have set a biannual

24:59.592 --> 25:02.895
updating process. Those sector plans that are in 
the high growth areas of the city will require

25:03.536 --> 25:10.463
revision. All plans will be reviewed every two 
years. I would imagine that the inner city plans

25:12.925 --> 25:19.071
are going to be relatively stable, but that those 
in rapid growth areas are going to be subject to

25:19.608 --> 25:27.496
continuous flux, and so we will be updating them 
and keeping current with them. Of course, we've

25:28.017 --> 25:49.058
already mentioned the new policy of, I guess it's 
an informal policy, of encouraging infilling

25:28.017 --> 25:49.058
into the older neighborhoods of Houston and 
greater attention to the needs of the commuter and

25:28.017 --> 25:49.058
metro and whatnot. That's quite a change from what 
it has been in the past when potential is largely

25:50.118 --> 25:58.151
focused on the fringe growth areas. Yes, we have a 
plan right now, our mobility plan, which is a gold

25:58.171 --> 26:11.772
document for mobility.

26:12.713 --> 26:24.808
Establish goals for all the various agencies 
responsible for traffic and transportation

26:12.713 --> 26:24.808
within the city, the state highway department, 
the metro, the city. And so right now, we're

26:24.828 --> 26:32.558
spending approximately $2 billion a year to 
improve traffic in Houston. And the eventual goal

26:32.578 --> 26:41.809
of our program is traffic

26:32.578 --> 26:41.809
and the condition of traffic, instead of being one 
of the black marks looked at when Houston is being

26:42.329 --> 26:46.794
considered. It'll be one of the positive points. 
And so we're proceeding with that. There's

26:50.579 --> 26:52.841
construction underway now all over the city. In 
its last bond issue, the city made a $600 million

26:53.923 --> 27:01.992
bond issue for public improvements, $400 million 
of which is going to streets. So the highway

27:03.154 --> 27:05.977
department has commitments. Every freeway in the 
city now is under construction or under

27:05.997 --> 27:10.362
expansion. Metro is implementing their process 
of putting bus lanes in the middle of every freeway

27:11.557 --> 27:22.129
and high occupancy vehicle lanes, actually. And 
so that we're seeing the light at the end of the

27:22.149 --> 27:34.082
tunnel, you might say, in that we're looking at the 
year 1994 when our system will be at capacity. And

27:34.102 --> 27:35.944
everything we do after 1994 will be, and that's 
from a system that was operating at 175% capacity.

27:44.505 --> 27:58.084
And that is, that would be the period in 1994 would 
be our break over point after which we will be

27:44.505 --> 27:58.084
building for projected growth rather than just

27:58.874 --> 28:04.260
building as a result of overcapacity of the 
system. Well, I've read horror stories about

28:04.841 --> 28:13.010
fires that have occurred in Houston, and there has 
not been enough water pressure to put them out.

28:14.231 --> 28:20.898
There have been so many leaks in the water 
distribution system that the pressure is

28:14.231 --> 28:20.898
insufficient for the fire.

28:23.702 --> 28:24.983
Well, I think we have two major, well actually 
three major enterprise programs. We call them

28:30.854 --> 28:37.843
enterprise funds in the city because those are 
funds that do not require money from the tax base.

28:37.863 --> 28:43.791
One is water, one is wastewater, and the other is 
airports. The water system right now, our master

28:43.811 --> 28:48.777
plan for water actually is not directed towards 
the matter of pressure and capacity because most

28:49.145 --> 29:00.226
of the city now is receiving its full range of 
capacity. Now, we do not have and do not meet the

29:00.246 --> 29:06.056
state standard of overhead water tanks to provide 
pressure in case of a power failure. And that is a

29:06.938 --> 29:10.765
continuing problem we have with the Water 
Commission, that it would cost multiple millions

29:11.791 --> 29:15.715
of dollars to build those tanks in order to have 
water. Because the maximum altitude in Houston is

29:15.755 --> 29:19.799
40 feet above sea level. And so we can't, in order to 
provide gravity pressure, we would have to do it

29:19.819 --> 29:25.665
artificially. So our entire system is based on 
pump pressure. Now there are some neighborhoods

29:31.171 --> 29:37.658
where we're in the process of replacing lines to 
provide adequate pressure. But under our current

29:37.678 --> 29:40.060
standards, we require the distance between water 
mains and water pressure the city is basically

29:40.630 --> 30:09.844
overcome that problem that you indicated there 
are some areas in the city still particularly

29:40.630 --> 30:09.844
industrial areas along the waterfront that might 
be a little further than 200 feet that we normally

29:40.630 --> 30:09.844
require from a water from a fire main but as a whole 
the all new development and most of the older city

29:40.630 --> 30:09.844
now meets that standard now in the area of 
wastewater We have embarked on another

30:10.533 --> 30:16.768
multi-billion dollar program to provide 
wastewater capacity. And we are again looking at

30:16.788 --> 30:28.677
1994 as a year in which we will be able to do away with 
all building controls as a result of lack of

30:16.788 --> 30:28.677
wastewater capacity. And at the present time, 
there is considerable work going on. As I say, it's

30:33.212 --> 30:39.138
a multi-billion dollar program, about $2.5 
billion to bring us up to that capacity. And as far

30:39.158 --> 30:44.924
as airports are concerned, we are expanding both 
Hobby and Intercontinental. Ellington Air Force

30:46.626 --> 30:52.532
Base, which has been turned over to the city, is 
being converted into a general aviation airport.

30:53.192 --> 30:57.837
And we've initiated the study for the West 
Airport, which would be a West commercial

30:53.192 --> 30:57.837
airport. In the vicinity of Katy? Yes, it'll go in 
this area here, which is between Brookshire and

31:01.820 --> 31:05.667
Katy. This is the area for the airport, which the 
city has already bought. They already own that

31:10.034 --> 31:11.015
land. That'll be very handy for people from 
College Station. Well, it'll be a lot closer going

31:16.244 --> 31:18.508
into Intercontinental. Right now, going into 
Intercontinental from the north is almost

31:19.383 --> 31:23.366
impossible. There doesn't seem to be any direct 
connection by road from Interstate 45 to the

31:24.407 --> 31:31.974
airport coming from the north. Well, of course, 
eventually we're going to have the Grand Parkway.

31:36.558 --> 31:45.786
And on the map behind you, you can see the track of 
the Grand Parkway, which is, yes, that heavy blue

31:36.558 --> 31:45.786
line coming across right there. No, no, around. 
It'll be a circle. Go up, right there, go left now.

31:53.679 --> 31:54.179
See that line? Oh, yeah. OK, that's the Grand 
Parkway. And what it'll do, you'll be able to pick

31:57.644 --> 32:07.960
that off of 290 and then get on the Grand Parkway, 
and then come on around, and then get off and get

31:57.644 --> 32:07.960
down to the airport. So you'll have the toll road 
coming straight south from there. going by the

32:11.172 --> 32:13.376
airport. It's the connection between Interstate 
45 and the airport coming from the north at this

32:13.496 --> 32:18.844
time. Well, see, between those two, we're now 
building the toll road, party toll road. Right

32:22.550 --> 32:22.891
here. Yeah. And that's going to be able to bring you 
down, straight down, and that'll have an exit at

32:24.173 --> 32:28.299
the airport. I hope it has a sign saying airport. 
There is none now. Absolutely none. When you come

32:33.320 --> 32:39.727
from the north, there is no sign saying airport 
until you get way down south of the airport and then

32:33.320 --> 32:39.727
you have to take the lateral. As a matter of 
interest, since you drive down from A&M all the

32:39.828 --> 32:49.179
time, you enter Houston ETJ when you leave the city 
limits of Prairie View. Come on.

32:55.587 --> 32:56.748
That's the limit of our ETJ. That red line on that 
map is the ETJ.

33:02.000 --> 33:03.802
We actually go further past Prairie View. We just 
have to stop at the city limit. You ran out of map.

33:10.291 --> 33:10.972
Very interesting. OK. An additional 
responsibility that we have is to maintain the

33:12.655 --> 33:28.817
extraterritorial jurisdiction and city limit 
agreements with 25 separate municipalities that

33:12.655 --> 33:28.817
impinge on the borders of Houston. What we do is we 
trade off ETJs and make certain agreements. For

33:36.533 --> 33:45.702
example, Hull Airport, which is outside Sugar 
Land, was in our ETJ. Sugar Land desired to make

33:47.044 --> 33:55.513
that their municipal airport and wanted to spend 
municipal bonds to improve it, but they couldn't

33:47.044 --> 33:55.513
do it as long as it was in our ETJ because they would 
never be able to annex it. So we agreed to trade Hull

33:56.320 --> 33:59.826
Airport to them. But in return, we got ETJ back from 
Sugar Land that begins to surround Sugar Land, so

34:00.687 --> 34:12.146
that Sugar Land won't be able to grow. We're now 
south of Sugar Land, all the way down to the Brazos

34:12.767 --> 34:15.351
River. And so we've cut off Sugar Land from going to 
the south, so basically Sugar Land has become a

34:16.072 --> 34:21.280
fixed size. Like Bel Air. Yes. And eventually, 
we'll be able to surround them with ETJ, and they

34:24.029 --> 34:27.813
won't be able to grow. And of course, that was our 
purpose, to do that. They needed the airport bad

34:31.317 --> 34:36.984
enough that they were willing to give up that 
authority. But we trade all the time. And we get

34:42.390 --> 34:50.900
involved in the creation of water districts and in 
monitoring the water districts. We have

34:50.920 --> 34:53.563
responsibility for monitoring all 600 municipal 
utility districts in the Houston area. On the map

34:58.788 --> 35:02.293
behind you, therefore, it says water districts. 
You see all the water districts that surround the

35:02.993 --> 35:05.997
city. The water district is our unit of land by 
which we annex, because we have to annex entire

35:06.037 --> 35:14.328
water districts. And on that map you're looking at 
actually is our last annexation with respect to

35:14.348 --> 35:20.096
what water districts were involved. We annexed 
about 13 square miles last year, about 25,000

35:23.665 --> 35:28.312
population. We are doing an orderly annexation. 
We have what we call an aggressive annexation

35:31.997 --> 35:34.120
policy. However, this year, because of two 
things, the great commitment of our enterprise

35:34.741 --> 35:53.368
funds, water and sewer, to meet existing needs and 
their inability to aggregate more debt, because

35:34.741 --> 35:53.368
we have to assume the debt of these utility 
districts. And also the city's inability to

35:53.568 --> 35:58.052
assume more debt from a debt service perspective. 
We limit our annexation only to very essential

35:58.613 --> 36:01.596
elements. But we see that probably with the 1990 
census, it will free us up under the Voter Voting

36:03.237 --> 36:17.792
Rights Act to be able to annex major areas like the 
1960 area. Because what we think that 1990 census

36:18.412 --> 36:23.237
will indicate is that our minority populations in 
the central city will have grown to the extent that

36:23.588 --> 36:40.005
we will be able to annex the Anglos that live out in 
the 1960 area without altering the racial balance

36:23.588 --> 36:40.005
in the city that existed in 1965, which is a 
requirement of the act.

36:40.025 --> 36:42.708
Very interesting. I understand that HGAC has 
recently completed a regional waste disposal

36:42.728 --> 36:51.857
plan. that has received uh has been received 
rather well and houston is participating in that

36:53.086 --> 37:20.545
yes

36:53.086 --> 37:20.545
we're looking very closely at resource recovery 
now there we have right now the city of houston does

36:53.086 --> 37:20.545
not have any landfills and it's not operating in 
landfills we contract with private companies

36:53.086 --> 37:20.545
it's a rather expensive uh proposition Right now, 
as part of our CIP, we're looking at buying a site in

37:21.976 --> 37:50.835
Brazoria County, which is some 35 miles from the 
city, and which would involve a rather

37:21.976 --> 37:50.835
comprehensive transportation plan to get 
everything down there, because our city, our ETJ

37:21.976 --> 37:50.835
from end to end is 70 miles, so that you would take 
the far end, you might have 50 to 100 miles to go with

37:51.153 --> 37:53.657
some of the waste. And so therefore, we're looking 
at resource recovery, which would be a plant that

37:53.677 --> 38:04.515
would burn the garbage and trash, convert it to 
electricity, and also reduce the ash. And the ash

38:05.257 --> 38:11.527
then would be transported by railroad car down to 
this landfill in Brazoria County. And you'd have

38:13.751 --> 38:15.574
only one of these facilities? Well, we're talking 
about building one, which would be a centralized

38:16.145 --> 38:19.551
one, a major one. We don't have it built yet. In the 
meantime, we're using BFI facilities. But it's

38:26.042 --> 38:35.498
very difficult to place landfills with the growth 
that has occurred around Houston in any area which

38:26.042 --> 38:35.498
is accessible. We have to go out considerable 
distances. So what we do now is we have transfer

38:37.882 --> 38:40.887
stations throughout the city where the trucks 
that do the initial pickup bring the stuff in, and

38:41.643 --> 38:53.555
then it's transferred to bigger trucks and then 
carted out to the landfills. Well, it's a problem

38:53.575 --> 38:56.638
for cities all around the country now. It's one of 
the major political headaches. Well, that would

38:58.680 --> 39:06.428
be one of the reasons that I see this resource 
recovery plant as a major solution to our problem.

39:06.849 --> 39:10.873
One of the things that happened is that we were in 
the process of getting it built. by the private

39:11.326 --> 39:22.720
sector using the tax credits, et cetera, that were 
allowed under the law, the new tax bill eliminated

39:11.326 --> 39:22.720
most of those credits. So now we're going to have to 
look at a different way of financing

39:22.740 --> 39:29.529
it. And then glass would be treated separately to 
recover the oil. Well, I've gone to see the one in

39:33.313 --> 39:34.715
Baltimore. Baltimore has a state of the art. And 
what they have a way of doing is they actually

39:41.667 --> 39:49.354
recover a lot of the materials, metals and so 
forth, and use that also as a source of revenue. But

39:49.374 --> 39:57.521
they just, in Baltimore, they just tip the garbage 
trucks right into the pit, and they burn

39:49.374 --> 39:57.521
everything.

39:57.541 --> 39:57.822
Interesting. There's no pre-separating. 
Reminds me, when I lived in LA as a kid, we had to

40:01.084 --> 40:08.952
separate our glass and our cans from garbage. We 
had three sacks. for every pickup. Everybody did

40:15.239 --> 40:16.120
it. No one complained. I think it's just what you 
get used to doing. One of the things you look at is

40:19.583 --> 40:26.489
the caloric content of the mix. And it has been 
found this system, for example, could be used in

40:28.250 --> 40:38.139
underdeveloped countries because the caloric 
mix of garbage there is different than American

40:28.250 --> 40:38.139
garbage.

40:39.980 --> 40:41.982
But Baltimore has proved to be a A very successful 
operation.

40:49.868 --> 40:51.351
Ephraim, thanks very much for your time. You'll 
receive a transcript of this whenever we can get

40:51.912 --> 40:56.260
around to doing it. And I hope that you can return it 
more quickly than we can get the transcript to you.

41:01.489 --> 41:02.170
Thanks very much. OK.
