00:02.258 --> 00:05.603
Testing, testing, one, two, one, two, one, two, 
three, four. Hello, hello, testing, one, two,

00:06.163 --> 00:08.286
three, four. Ray's got a little headache with this 
sexual orientation, doesn't he? This is August

00:14.154 --> 00:31.017
23rd in the Harrington building, and I have the 
honor and pleasure of interviewing Professor

00:14.154 --> 00:31.017
John Hoyle about his three decades or more service 
here at A&M. John, to begin with, to introduce

00:32.043 --> 00:42.459
yourself to some stranger who might listen to this 
tape or read the transcript, describe your

00:32.043 --> 00:42.459
background before you came to A&M. Where did you 
grow up? What did Mom and Dad do? Where did you go to

00:44.382 --> 00:45.264
college? Where were you working before A&M? Okay. 
Well, I was born in a small town in Oklahoma, Rush

00:48.529 --> 00:55.861
Springs, Oklahoma, February 2, 1935, born in the 
house. The house is still there, still stands in a

00:56.121 --> 00:58.525
little town. And... We moved around quite a lot as a 
child because dad trying to find employment and

01:00.275 --> 01:05.884
those kinds of things. But I wound up in high 
school, my final two years in high school at Tulsa

01:07.106 --> 01:13.395
Will Rogers High School. My older sister, 
Beverly, was two years ahead of me. She finished at

01:21.588 --> 01:27.177
Tulsa Central High School and my younger brother, 
Jay, who's two years younger, finished at

01:27.680 --> 01:28.801
Longview High School. They moved again after I 
graduated from high school at Tulsa Will Rogers.

01:32.485 --> 01:38.711
And then I made the decision to come to Texas A&M. 
One of my classmates' dad, Ted Wrench, his

01:38.771 --> 01:47.260
daughter Dorothy was a high school classmate of 
mine. And Ted had seen me play baseball for Tulsa

01:48.041 --> 01:54.227
Will Rogers and knew Bo Bell, the head baseball 
coach at Texas A&M. And I got in touch with him, and

01:54.832 --> 01:57.796
they offered me a scholarship. And the former 
student association, Tulsa, Oklahoma, paid my

01:57.816 --> 02:01.921
out-of-state tuition. And we came here then. I was 
a freshman here in the fall of 1953. Lived in the

02:08.248 --> 02:10.331
athletic dorm, which was in Hart Hall. And all the 
athletes were in Hart Hall, in football,

02:11.092 --> 02:16.979
basketball, track, swimming, all of us, which 
made it rather interesting. That was before Bear

02:16.999 --> 02:24.568
Bryant came and set up a new athletic dorm, 
Henderson Hall, for football. We were all

02:25.156 --> 02:30.022
together there in this hot, forsaken place. I'll 
never forget, we drove down all night from Tulsa.

02:35.648 --> 02:37.671
We got into College Station about 3 in the morning. 
There was no motel rooms. They were all taken.

02:42.156 --> 02:49.084
About close to 7,000 students that year, and the 
Corps was mandatory, which I did not know when I got

02:42.156 --> 02:49.084
here. I didn't know there were no women here. I had 
no idea. I had a baseball scholarship. And folks

02:53.725 --> 02:55.488
had driven all night. No place to stay. We'd drive 
back to Hearn and get a, it was a big kind of a

02:56.589 --> 03:01.256
boarding house type thing. And we spent two or 
three hours sleeping. And then I came on campus the

03:04.121 --> 03:08.587
next morning and met Coach Bell. And part of my job 
was to be a Sevesa volunteer, to wait tables in

03:08.627 --> 03:12.273
Sevesa. And I remember I was playing in a baseball 
championship in Kansas, a Jayhawk League or a Van

03:13.094 --> 03:23.209
Johnson League, and made a mistake going into a 
barbershop and saying, take off my sideburns.

03:23.628 --> 03:27.732
Well, he gave me a burr haircut and skinned the side 
of my head to a white wall. And I got to College

03:27.752 --> 03:31.335
Station, and I was a hero among the upperclassmen. 
So we started in a corps in A athletics. And that was

03:34.758 --> 03:37.240
my early orientation. Jim Cashin, a local here, 
had played football for the Aggies in the 40s. And

03:42.644 --> 03:45.407
his brother, Red Cashin, of course, a famous 
football official. He was our dorm advisor. He was

03:48.810 --> 03:52.673
the one to keep all the athletes in some kind of 
order And he told me the story later. Mother and Dad

03:56.527 --> 03:59.471
had driven me all the way down here in an old Nash 
automobile. And they're getting ready to leave,

04:00.352 --> 04:09.245
and Mother turns over to this very proud Captain 
Cashin and said, please take care of my little boy.

04:10.707 --> 04:19.259
And Cashin's laughed about that over the years 
because he had to watch me as hard as any of the rest

04:10.707 --> 04:19.259
of them that first year with some of the crazy 
antics that we did. But that was sort of an early

04:19.399 --> 04:22.744
orientation of where we came from. where I came 
from. Okay, then after you graduated, when? I

04:27.922 --> 04:29.243
graduated in 1957. And then where? Went to Odessa, 
Texas. At that time, I was even thinking about

04:36.211 --> 04:38.994
being a pro baseball player. I didn't take a 
contract with a corps because I was really

04:39.014 --> 04:43.599
interested in trying to play some professional 
baseball. And I had married, and Carolyn was going

04:44.540 --> 04:52.528
to finish that summer at TCU. And so I just decided 
to forego the baseball, pro baseball, and took a

04:53.335 --> 05:01.344
teaching and coaching position. And I taught math 
and science and coached junior high sports. And

05:05.049 --> 05:07.451
Carolyn taught English in Odessa. And we had our 
first child there, Johnny, who's now a counselor

05:08.433 --> 05:15.281
here in the local junior high school in College 
Station. And then the military called. Rather

05:19.726 --> 05:22.549
than going in for three years, I went in for six 
months. And I was classified as critical skill at

05:23.288 --> 05:29.997
that time, Haskell, because Slick Rutherford was 
our area representative. They called him Slick

05:30.017 --> 05:31.179
Rutherford. And the US government then knew we had 
to catch the Russians in space. And I was a science

05:35.445 --> 05:36.627
teacher. And I came back to school through the 
National Science Foundation to Texas A&M to learn

05:36.667 --> 05:42.054
science. I took courses in physics and so on in 
order to teach students and get ready to catch the

05:42.115 --> 05:48.564
Russians in space, which we did. My small part 
probably was not very significant, but we did

05:48.624 --> 05:53.110
catch the Russians in space. My mother had been a 
constant encourager throughout that. She had

05:58.931 --> 06:02.074
three years of college at Oklahoma College for 
Women in Chickasha. She had her teaching

06:02.695 --> 06:04.757
certificate, never taught a day. My dad was a 10th 
grade dropout. He was a salesman, wound up with the

06:09.282 --> 06:15.168
home state farm insurance and later American 
General. He retired at age 62, and he's 91 now and

06:15.728 --> 06:19.673
still living. Mother died two years ago, but 
Mother was the one who really encouraged me

06:22.165 --> 06:36.041
intellectually, academically, got me 
interested in music, and that, she's been gone two

06:22.165 --> 06:36.041
years, but she was very much an influence there. 
All right, so you taught, this is in the Odessa

06:36.682 --> 06:39.705
system. Odessa, Ector County, Ector County 
School District. I was there four years. And then

06:43.290 --> 06:43.810
where? Went to Ector, I mean, went to Midland High 
School. I had wanted to be head baseball coach, And

06:51.612 --> 06:58.778
about that time, I had finished up my master's 
degree through the National Science Foundation

06:51.612 --> 06:58.778
and got my certification for school 
administration. Where? Here at Texas A&M through

06:59.539 --> 07:04.503
Dr. Paul Hensling, who was such an influential 
person in my life.

07:08.167 --> 07:13.411
Some of those individuals in education, Walter 
was in psychology. Barbel? Walter Barbel. Barbel

07:15.513 --> 07:16.654
was on my committee. And then I was named head 
baseball coach at Midland High School. which is

07:21.818 --> 07:22.860
one of my dreams. I wanted to coach, be the head 
coach of a high school baseball team. And finished

07:26.405 --> 07:29.530
my master's then about after two years. And the 
superintendent out there called me in and says,

07:30.211 --> 07:35.980
John, Dr. Hensling at Texas A&M tells me you're 
ready for school administration. Your coaching

07:36.440 --> 07:37.482
days are over. And I was doing pretty well, but I 
knew that that was a career I wanted to go. And then I

07:42.750 --> 07:45.615
got really excited. Dr. Hensling says, you need to 
go get a PhD. I knew I was a pretty good student. as an

07:50.810 --> 07:51.871
undergraduate. When I really wanted to study, I 
could. I could make it. But being an athlete and

07:54.916 --> 08:05.290
looking at pro ball and looking at, you know, where 
the women were because there weren't any here and

07:54.916 --> 08:05.290
those kinds of things, I wasn't focused as clearly 
as I should have been. But he and others said, John,

08:05.310 --> 08:08.414
you're a good student. Go to Colorado University. 
I've done a master's study for Dr. Paul Hensling.

08:13.982 --> 08:17.447
It was a three-hour problems course on Ph.D. and 
Ed.D. nationwide. I did that study for Dr.

08:19.565 --> 08:21.727
Hensling. He then put together the proposal for 
the Ph.D. program here for Texas A&M University.

08:28.193 --> 08:30.735
And you were involved in that. You were here as dean 
of faculties and so on when I was a doctoral

08:30.755 --> 08:35.259
student. And I remember you grading the proposals 
for the dissertations. And I remember your

08:39.503 --> 08:43.666
little, I'll never forget this, don't use 
one-sentence paragraphs. You said that. And I

08:45.308 --> 08:47.850
never have since that time. I struggled through 
three years there. I was able to transfer work from

08:50.766 --> 08:53.089
Colorado University. I started up there, had two 
semesters, and A&M's program was approved in 1964

08:53.149 --> 08:58.655
by the coordinating board. Dr. Hensling put it 
together with the support of President Rutter and

08:59.516 --> 09:09.208
certainly our dean, Frank Hubert. But he really 
was the hammer for getting that Ph.D. program

09:09.989 --> 09:14.515
together. So you got your doctoral degree here? I 
got it here. I transferred my work in 1967. I

09:19.589 --> 09:22.693
transferred and worked in Colorado University 
and they accepted it in 67. PhD, at that point, I

09:23.114 --> 09:27.380
really enjoyed my research. My research was in the 
behavioral science area and applying it to

09:27.460 --> 09:32.808
schools and leadership. And I had a chance then to 
become assistant superintendent at Harlingen,

09:33.649 --> 09:43.403
making quite a bit of money, or go to TCU as a 
beginning professor for half the salary. Well, I

09:44.108 --> 09:50.496
was teaching, thanks to Dr. Hensling, teaching 
undergraduate students in educational

09:44.108 --> 09:50.496
psychology and social foundations. And I really 
loved it. I felt like that's where I belong. So TCU

09:53.459 --> 09:56.903
is where we went in 67, January of 67. Stayed there 
three years. What was that TCU salary? TCU salary

10:01.809 --> 10:07.676
was $12,500 for 10 1⁄2

10:01.809 --> 10:07.676
months. And the assistant superintendency was 
$22,500. And that was big money. But I knew there

10:14.955 --> 10:16.558
was something there. And first year, in fact, 
Rotary International selected me for some reason

10:16.718 --> 10:26.972
as one of five outstanding young Texans from the 
Dallas-Fort Worth, Texas area. And I went to New

10:27.573 --> 10:34.123
Zealand with five other people for four months and 
really started getting interested in

10:27.573 --> 10:34.123
international kinds of things. Stayed at TCU two 
years, and then I had a postdoc in

10:34.663 --> 10:39.951
computer-assisted learning at TCU. under the 
great Dr. Herbert Legron, who was the dean of

10:40.657 --> 10:46.169
education at TCU, brilliant man. And then West 
Texas State at the time was trying to start a

10:47.191 --> 10:55.909
computer-assisted large group, small group 
educational psychology program. And I went out

10:55.929 --> 10:57.071
there for a year. And from there, I went to Miami of 
Ohio, where The dean there, Dean Bogner, and a guy

11:01.750 --> 11:07.658
named Charles Techman, said we want you to write 
and publish and learn. We want you to really become

11:08.459 --> 11:15.829
a significant scholar, and we'll protect you from 
a lot of the things that young professors have to

11:08.459 --> 11:15.829
put up with. Stayed there four years. Came back 
then to Tulsa University in 1974 as department

11:18.052 --> 11:26.444
head, thinking I'd be there forever. Hometown. 
Mother and dad lived there. Sister and

11:28.867 --> 11:30.289
brother-in-law lived there. And all of a sudden, I 
met a bunch of Texas A&M faculty at a national

11:31.450 --> 11:39.317
meeting, and I'd just been named a good fortune. 
Larry Haskew, through his influence at the

11:39.417 --> 11:48.244
University of Texas, he and some others elected me 
president of the National Council of Professors

11:39.417 --> 11:48.244
of Administration. And I was really 40, I guess 39, 
40 years old. The next thing I know, Dr. Hawkins

11:53.849 --> 12:01.035
here, Harold Hawkins, Frank Hubert, were calling 
me and offering me a chance to come and interview

12:01.673 --> 12:14.645
for an open position here in educational 
administration, especially in some of the

12:01.673 --> 12:14.645
research, organizational theory, and futures 
visioning kind of thing. Well, I came here after

12:14.666 --> 12:19.971
only one year at Tulsa and thinking, well, that's a 
quick move. And I was afraid that some of the old

12:20.031 --> 12:26.197
professors remembered me as being not too smart or 
not being too brilliant or something. But they had

12:26.837 --> 12:29.740
all either retired or died or something else. And 
so we thought it all over, and here I wound up coming

12:30.277 --> 12:33.803
here in the fall of 75. Describe the interview 
process. All right. First thing, when I came in, it

12:39.893 --> 12:47.426
was a matter of talking with Dr. Hawkins about the 
program. Of course, Dr. Hensling was here, was

12:47.446 --> 12:51.032
pushing me without any question. He thought I 
could do no wrong because that's how I felt about

12:51.052 --> 12:55.660
him. And he was pushing me and some of the younger 
colleagues my age were pushing me who had seen me at

12:56.281 --> 13:01.187
the national level. Jim McNamara, for instance, 
recommended me because of some of my research. And

13:04.992 --> 13:10.319
I met with some of the faculty, and then here I go up 
to Frank Hubert. He and Hawkins were together.

13:12.983 --> 13:19.411
Well, I'd worked for Frank Hubert as his assistant 
dean, not officially, but assistant graduate

13:12.983 --> 13:19.411
student dean. And he was a little bit 
intimidating. And I never knew exactly when I was

13:23.357 --> 13:25.900
around him you know, whether to laugh or be 
serious. He was on my doctoral committee as well.

13:31.645 --> 13:32.025
Tough. Do you remember any key questions he asked? 
Oh, yeah, yeah. He asked me about my line of

13:39.772 --> 13:50.262
research and wanted to know how I could make that 
research relevant to improving schools, those

13:39.772 --> 13:50.262
kinds of things. And then he He said, here are the 
courses you'll be teaching, and you've got a tough

13:54.719 --> 14:00.126
act to follow with McNamara. I said, I understand 
that. McNamara went off to Columbia for a year and

14:02.289 --> 14:04.472
then came back. And some of those kinds of 
questions, I didn't have to make a formal

14:05.554 --> 14:10.440
presentation at the time. And then I said, well, 
here's what my salary, here's what I need. And I

14:16.469 --> 14:22.617
said something to the effect that... That this is 
what it'll take. And I'm up for full professor at

14:24.731 --> 14:27.415
Tulsa University. I want to be considered for that 
when I come here at the end of one year. Well, I

14:31.402 --> 14:45.685
didn't get full professor, but I got tenure at the 
end of one year because at that time we had a new vice

14:31.402 --> 14:45.685
president come in here who said there'll be no 
Aggies promoted, you know, while I'm here. This is

14:46.576 --> 14:48.779
70. That was 1975, fall of 75. We had a provost and 
vice president. Kind of trying to think of his

14:57.091 --> 14:58.193
name. He was in medicine. He was in... Wait, 75? 
Yeah, 75. Calhoun was vice president in 75. No, no.

15:06.585 --> 15:07.386
A brand new one. They just put in a brand new one. I 
think he was on the State Board of Education later.

15:12.433 --> 15:13.315
I can't think of his name. And you're not thinking 
about Winerdi? No, no, when Ernie was assistant or

15:16.141 --> 15:19.925
associate to him at the time. And it's 75. 75. 
Because see, Williams is president from 70 to 76.

15:29.136 --> 15:33.822
And Calhoun is serving under him until 77. Yeah, 
but there was somebody else that came in in 76.

15:41.291 --> 15:43.593
I can't think of his name. He was sort of a short guy 
in medicine. It was at Radar on State Road anyway.

15:48.160 --> 15:52.886
And they said, well, he said, we've recommended 
you across the street, but they're not promoting

15:48.160 --> 15:52.886
any ag. I said, well, didn't you tell them I'd been 
gone and been away? Well, it was that kind of thing.

15:56.691 --> 16:00.075
And that was the only time I was really upset being 
here. But I went ahead and I received tenure. And I

16:03.900 --> 16:06.803
won't ask Sally anymore. What was the beginning 
salary here? Twenty, twenty-five, twenty-five.

16:16.672 --> 16:21.077
which represented about a $4,000 raise from Tulsa 
University. Did you get the impression that they

16:21.778 --> 16:34.633
were, were you one of a bunch that they were 
considering, or did you have the impression they

16:21.778 --> 16:34.633
were trying to attract you? There was not a bunch. 
McNamara, who had already developed a pretty good

16:37.576 --> 16:42.722
national reputation, he and I were doing some 
similar kind of research. And he told Frank

16:43.102 --> 16:45.345
Hubert, here's the guy. And Frank had such respect 
for Jim. It was pretty much a done deal if I could get

16:48.440 --> 16:56.609
enough salary to make it worthwhile and to make the 
move because we had a good situation in Tulsa.

16:56.629 --> 17:01.935
Describe moving your family and settling in Bryan 
College Station at that time. Okay. We, of course,

17:03.036 --> 17:12.146
it was one of those last, we didn't know until 
probably July we were coming. So we started

17:12.166 --> 17:14.168
looking for a place to stay. We found a house down on 
Pershing, five bedroom, nice big house that

17:15.008 --> 17:26.741
belonged to an individual in biology who was in 
Australia on sabbatical. We leased that house.

17:29.825 --> 17:32.127
Wanted to buy it, but he wouldn't sell it. And so we 
built then down Southwood Valley. But I remember

17:35.171 --> 17:36.572
how hot it was. Homer Adams moved us in here. And I 
had known him as when I was an undergraduate. And I

17:45.653 --> 17:49.958
just remember how hot it was, how miserable it was. 
But the house was air conditioned. It had a nice

17:52.461 --> 17:54.463
shade and all those kinds of things. I couldn't get 
any kids in school. See, I had a son who was already,

17:56.886 --> 18:04.535
he'd been a sophomore at Tulsa Memorial, trying to 
bring him in as a sophomore. He wasn't too pleased

18:05.136 --> 18:10.542
with that, but it's a lot smaller high school, and 
he was a pretty little basketball player, and I was

18:05.136 --> 18:10.542
hoping he would adjust. And he did. My daughter, 
though, however, she comes into the schools,

18:15.826 --> 18:16.787
Didn't have any friends. And it was difficult for 
her until probably her junior year in high school.

18:22.256 --> 18:26.322
And she doesn't look back on high school with as 
much fun. Sometimes it really affects one child

18:27.684 --> 18:31.370
more than it does the other, as you well know. I 
don't regret it, but I wish she had had a happier

18:32.392 --> 18:37.880
junior high and high school experience. And I've 
often thought, well, maybe I wasn't too sensitive

18:37.900 --> 18:41.846
about that. But anyway. They both graduated from 
Texas A&M, and Laura's teaching down in

18:42.910 --> 18:47.959
Friendswood. Her husband, Ross, is an Aggie in 
engineering. He's with Hewlett Packard, 14 and

18:53.650 --> 18:58.519
10-year-old grandsons. Son John is here, a 
counselor at the junior high, seventh grade, has a

18:58.539 --> 19:06.353
master's degree, a bachelor's here, a master's 
from SFA in counseling. His wife, Julie, teaches

19:06.569 --> 19:13.047
at Sam Rayburn in Bryan, two grandkids. Winston is 
11, no, 10, playing football, 11. playing

19:18.449 --> 19:20.811
football here at the seventh grade junior high. 
I'm going to go out and watch him at four o'clock

19:20.831 --> 19:22.493
today. And then Jennifer started first grade this 
year. So we've got four Aggies really. If I could

19:29.900 --> 19:37.167
interview your wife about the move, what do you 
think she would say about moving down here then?

19:37.808 --> 19:39.509
Oh, it was home. Her mother and father were still 
living. And so it was home because when we came back

19:41.952 --> 19:47.477
to graduate school here, her mom helped us find a 
rent house. They were good babysitters and not

19:50.845 --> 19:55.645
only that,

19:57.025 --> 20:06.620
I think during that period of time, I never had to 
worry about having a car problem because my

19:57.025 --> 20:06.620
father-in-law, Frenchie Falgo, worked at Hossle 
Garage and could fix anything. And as long as it was

20:07.341 --> 20:09.705
his baby's car, she was an only. So it was really, 
she was glad to came back because of her family ties

20:10.687 --> 20:15.975
here. And she went to high school in Stephen F. 
Austin here in Bryan. So she knew a lot of people.

20:20.823 --> 20:22.165
She immediately got a job. She had finished her 
master's at Miami of Ohio. and had a strong English

20:24.751 --> 20:43.336
background, so they hired her at Blinn College, 
and she, for 15 years, has been assistant

20:24.751 --> 20:43.336
department head of English and just stepped out of 
that this year, and now she's teaching part-time,

20:24.751 --> 20:43.336
teaching two classes a week, but that was really 
good for her to come back. I mean, it was

20:43.436 --> 20:52.108
frustrating, but we were still young enough and 
had a lot of young friends that we blended in with

20:43.436 --> 20:52.108
the church and We've been a member of the Disciples 
of Christ Church, First Christian Church, ever

20:52.392 --> 20:55.896
since we married. So we've been involved in that 
ever since we came here. Describe the department

20:58.640 --> 21:03.967
as you arrived and becoming a part of that group. 
All right. It was

21:05.228 --> 21:09.754
interesting. It had a split between the 
practitioner type, former superintendent type.

21:17.418 --> 21:20.303
like Dr. Henseling, like Dr. Les Richardson. And 
then we had a community ed program. Bob Barrage and

21:23.828 --> 21:27.794
others had become kind of nationally well-known 
in community ed.

21:31.320 --> 21:37.610
The scholarship and the publications, it was just 
beginning with two or three. Phil West was very

21:37.970 --> 21:39.192
good. He was on the staff in terms of scholarship. 
But we then After one year, we were able then to

21:44.789 --> 21:49.053
bring in Dr. David Erlandson. And then Jim 
McNamara came back the third year. So we began to

21:54.418 --> 22:00.023
develop a really good, solid scholarship and 
became more and more prominent across the nation.

22:00.484 --> 22:10.053
And now, of course, we've hired minorities, 
women, and really have a fine, diverse faculty and

22:00.484 --> 22:10.053
consider ourselves in the top 10% around the 
country. And I think we are. at that time was there

22:12.042 --> 22:16.449
tension in the department between those two 
factions? Not so much as there is now. We needed

22:19.753 --> 22:35.677
more tension at the time because here I was trying 
to work with the practitioners because I'd known a

22:19.753 --> 22:35.677
bunch of them through my public school days and 
also trying to develop my scholarship agenda.

22:36.718 --> 22:41.205
Here I was trying to do both and some weren't 
publishing anything And it was awkward, really,

22:42.164 --> 22:53.556
for me to try to move into the academic arena when I 
could have gotten by pretty well without doing it.

22:55.238 --> 22:58.061
But I'm glad I continued doing the writing and 
publishing. And it's been good. And now it's a real

22:59.523 --> 23:10.635
joy for me to be at the stage in my career where I'm 
asked to do articles for referee journals and

22:59.523 --> 23:10.635
chapters for books and books. And I'm pleased to 
ask my younger colleagues. I say, hey, I don't have

23:13.108 --> 23:14.610
time to do this. Would you help me do this, 
co-author these things? And that's a real joy to

23:17.213 --> 23:19.897
see that happen. Prior to your coming, what was 
your most best known research product? I think

23:26.987 --> 23:36.480
probably work I'd done in school climate and our 
dealing with school cultures. I had done some

23:37.481 --> 23:40.285
research in some major cities. going and actually 
spending time with schools to finding schools

23:40.636 --> 23:49.506
where there really was an open environment for 
learning as opposed to a very rigid, structured

23:40.636 --> 23:49.506
kind of learning. I guess I developed that pretty 
well. And then it was very soon after that when I was

23:53.050 --> 24:03.642
invited and I got what is known as the National 
Professor of the Year honor for American

23:53.050 --> 24:03.642
Association of School Administrators. And in 82, 
I went to Washington for four months. and wrote the

24:07.231 --> 24:20.388
first set of guidelines for the preparation of 
school administrators, which has evolved into

24:07.231 --> 24:20.388
the new ISLIC state national standards created by 
a group from the chief state school officers. And

24:21.230 --> 24:24.534
then I chaired the national commission on 
standards for the superintendency. So I've

24:25.015 --> 24:32.525
become known, I guess, by having a lot of support 
and a lot of help by this department, Texas A&M.

24:32.545 --> 24:33.406
They've encouraged me. Dr. Hawkins did. David 
Erlandson did. And now, of course, Brian Cole

24:37.117 --> 24:39.180
does. They've never tried to get me too tied up with 
administration. And I have had chances to become

24:44.509 --> 24:49.296
dean at other places. But I said, well, I want a 
career where I can travel, I can write. And now I've

24:55.486 --> 24:57.990
become very fortunate. I've been invited to speak 
to a lot of national conferences, futures

24:58.291 --> 25:04.761
conferences. I was lucky enough, fortunate 
enough, to keynote the first National

25:05.382 --> 25:13.473
Cooperative Extension Conference in Cincinnati 
two years ago on the future envisioning and things

25:05.382 --> 25:13.473
like that. And I'm working now with the College of 
Business here on campus with their executive

25:13.493 --> 25:18.760
development programs. And then, as you know, with 
FSIS, teaching courses in creative thinking,

25:18.820 --> 25:25.028
problem solving, and coaching kinds of things. So 
I'm glad 15 years ago, 20 years ago, when I decided I

25:30.172 --> 25:31.774
don't want to be a dean. I'm glad I made that 
decision and stuck with it because a lot of my

25:32.274 --> 25:44.526
friends went dean, then professor, dean, back 
professor, and they never did become deans, but

25:32.274 --> 25:44.526
they never did move in the mainstream of their 
discipline either. And so I've been lucky there

25:45.667 --> 25:47.329
maybe. I don't know whether I've been a good dean. I 
respect people who do become good deans, but those

25:48.890 --> 25:59.200
are the tough decisions that we have in faculty 
life because everybody thinks, oh, here's a guy

25:48.890 --> 25:59.200
who can speak well, likes people, he'd be a great 
dean. Everybody pushes you to be a dean or be a vice

25:59.821 --> 26:03.226
president or something else. And our 
discipline's had a hard time gaining respect

26:03.947 --> 26:06.791
anyway. And so I've tried to be in that fight to say 
we have a knowledge base, we prepare leaders as

26:07.392 --> 26:17.887
well as anybody, and here's some of our proof and 
our research and those kinds of things. So it's

26:17.948 --> 26:23.095
being proud of our discipline, I guess, and what 
we're trying to do has kept me in it. And when you got

26:23.513 --> 26:25.836
here, who was the department chairman? Dr. Hal 
Hawkins. And should I say head or chairman? Yeah,

26:29.181 --> 26:30.082
he was head. Yeah. Describe his administrative 
style. Well, pretty much down the line, line of

26:34.628 --> 26:44.482
staff like the rest of the department heads were at 
that time in the 70s, like Frank Hubert was at the

26:34.628 --> 26:44.482
time. There wasn't a lot of site-based 
decision-making. I remember, I could remember,

26:48.988 --> 26:52.052
for instance... kind of bucking the trend, we 
wanted to look at our knowledge, what we were

26:52.505 --> 26:58.253
teaching within the college and how it fit with the 
national thing. And Dr. Hubert appointed me to a

26:58.353 --> 27:06.263
committee to write a concept paper, as he called 
it, on where we are in our discipline. And I tried to

27:06.283 --> 27:07.625
explain all those things. He was on the committee. 
And I was still intimidated by him being on that

27:09.147 --> 27:13.813
committee, even though we were so-called equals. 
And I'll never forget, he said, I found a

27:14.654 --> 27:19.321
professor. I mean, a person who had been a former 
chancellor either at the University of Missouri

27:22.728 --> 27:35.267
or some other institution, this was in the 77 or 8, I 
guess, that is retiring from, he may have been head

27:22.728 --> 27:35.267
of the Missouri State Coordinating Board or 
something of higher education. So he wants to be a

27:35.287 --> 27:37.570
higher ed prof. I said, excellent. Does he have a 
degree in educational administration or in

27:39.493 --> 27:42.237
management? Oh, no, it's in English or something. 
And I'll never forget, I said, well, Dr. Hubert,

27:44.935 --> 27:48.481
that's kind of naive, isn't it? You just had me 
write a concept paper about what we need to have in

27:48.501 --> 27:51.846
our discipline. You're telling me you want to 
bring somebody in or teach higher ed? And you know

27:54.670 --> 27:55.311
what? People around the table thought I was going 
to be fired. But he backed off and said, Hoyle's

27:59.358 --> 28:01.101
right. He's got enough courage, enough 
conviction what his discipline's all about. And I

28:06.509 --> 28:11.517
really respected him for that, because I thought 
he'd really be angry, because he wanted to bring in

28:06.509 --> 28:11.517
a buddy. I think that was somebody that had once 
been in Austin while he was over there. I think

28:17.793 --> 28:18.594
you're right. I think you're right. And then he 
went to Missouri. I think it was the equivalent of

28:20.998 --> 28:24.384
the head of the coordinating board. Because I 
think in Austin he had been the number two or number

28:24.684 --> 28:28.290
three man. Yeah, that's right. That's right. So 
the department operated, by and large, strong

28:37.450 --> 28:39.113
leadership. Strong leadership, department head 
without question. It wasn't any of this chair

28:41.397 --> 28:43.601
stuff where you rotate it. And y'all were located 
where? We were located in, we got, I was, we were in

28:45.123 --> 28:49.190
Harrington. Already? Yeah, we'd already moved 
two years before from academic building to

28:50.373 --> 28:54.259
Harrington. And about how many were in the, on the 
faculty? There were about seven, maybe eight. We

29:02.047 --> 29:07.211
had probably an adjunct, but probably eight 
faculty. And there were undergraduate and

29:07.231 --> 29:10.014
masters? Well, at that point, you see, when I got 
back here, the College of Education had the

29:10.034 --> 29:20.383
Department of Educational Administration, all 
graduate programs. The undergraduates were in

29:20.964 --> 29:26.509
EDCI, the Career Construction Teacher 
Education. And it's the only time I've been able to

29:26.590 --> 29:36.703
work with undergraduates, even though I taught 
them at TCU in Miami, Ohio, as when Carolyn, my

29:26.590 --> 29:36.703
wife, and I take kids to Europe for the study 
abroad. We've taken three groups of future

29:36.763 --> 29:48.297
teachers to Santa Chiara Study Center in Italy, 
where I teach undergraduate courses since I

29:36.763 --> 29:48.297
majored in education here at Texas A&M, not 
educational administration. I had a minor in

29:48.958 --> 29:55.146
educational administration, but it really has 
helped me now, because I've taught Ed Psych, I've

29:48.958 --> 29:55.146
taught other courses, because I had a good, broad, 
liberal education. And I really think in many ways

29:59.833 --> 30:14.614
the early Ph.D. program here in education was 
stronger and more, I think, more comprehensive

29:59.833 --> 30:14.614
than our becoming too specialized in curriculum 
or in Ed Psych or in administration. They made us go

30:15.555 --> 30:16.597
outside. I took courses from Bard and Nelson. in 
sociology, and I took social psychology. I took

30:24.471 --> 30:32.383
philosophy under a new professor of philosophy we 
had here, and management under Dr. Rice. I really,

30:33.644 --> 30:40.174
I wanted to, oh yeah, and a great course on great 
books from Dean John Paul Abbott. And our students

30:41.957 --> 30:44.200
don't have that opportunity anymore. Our 
programs are too tightly organized, and I've,

30:49.700 --> 30:58.892
Most of the students I advise, I try to get them into 
philosophy, into the center, into the Bush

30:49.700 --> 30:58.892
Center, into business to expand them a little bit. 
Did anyone give you advice as a new faculty member

30:59.452 --> 31:02.817
here? What to do or not to do? No, Dr. Hensling 
probably. In sitting with him, just great wisdom

31:08.844 --> 31:13.210
that man had. No, they just assumed I knew what I was 
supposed to do. What were your first course

31:16.813 --> 31:19.660
assignments? I picked up the course I'm teaching 
right now, The Nature and Problems of

31:19.680 --> 31:26.777
Administrative Behavior, which is
