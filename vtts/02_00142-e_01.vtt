00:02.309 --> 00:11.228
You look back on all of these years, what were some of the happiest moments at A&M, and if there were any, any sad moments?

00:15.537 --> 00:17.922
Proudest, happiest, most pleasant.

00:19.589 --> 00:23.977
Well, I think, you know, most of my time at A&M was enjoyable to me.

00:24.418 --> 00:32.632
There was the loneliness and the early adjustments, you know, that everybody, everybody went through in those days, and the question of whether you should have been there.

00:33.654 --> 00:42.289
I think, though, that on several occasions in Kyle Field, when I broke the world record, would rank among the, not

00:42.269 --> 01:07.467
happiest days as an athlete of course and because it was at home and getting to do it there with the support and and you know like all Aggies I think the the feeling of graduating and walking across the stage I think I had a good feeling about that that was important to me and and I'm

01:09.168 --> 01:13.315
Got good memories of that time and the way that felt to finally arriving.

01:13.335 --> 01:18.604
That's one of the things, like I was telling you about having a gold medal, they can't take that away from you after you get it.

01:19.565 --> 01:25.695
A lot of things you can lose, you know, you can lose your money, you can lose your job and stuff, but you can't take that away from you.

01:25.715 --> 01:29.742
That's kind of a milestone in your life.

01:33.012 --> 01:37.381
Don't have a lot of what I would call real sad times, I think.

01:37.642 --> 01:44.897
You know, there's little disappointments and wrong role, but I try to use those as motivation for, you know, the future.

01:45.418 --> 01:46.320
Did you ever get homesick?

01:46.781 --> 01:47.763
Yeah, homesick a lot.

01:48.384 --> 01:51.831
Thought about leaving a number of times, you know, when I was a freshman.

01:52.486 --> 01:53.708
But I didn't have any place to go.

01:54.689 --> 01:57.633
So that was much closer to home that I wanted to go to.

01:58.274 --> 02:00.858
Did you ever admit that to anybody?

02:00.878 --> 02:01.158
Oh, yeah.

02:01.258 --> 02:02.961
My roommate, all the time.

02:03.441 --> 02:05.644
Matter of fact, he left.

02:05.704 --> 02:07.547
Went to the University of Texas after a year.

02:07.607 --> 02:09.430
Donnie did?

02:09.450 --> 02:09.970
Donnie did.

02:09.990 --> 02:11.072
He left.

02:12.814 --> 02:14.356
Went over there, helped him find a room.

02:15.798 --> 02:16.700
And I drove back.

02:18.422 --> 02:19.884
That was probably on about Wednesday.

02:20.345 --> 02:20.485
Mm-hmm.

02:21.629 --> 02:30.839
I guess on Friday evening before classes started on Monday, I heard a knock on my door and I opened the door.

02:30.859 --> 02:31.960
There's Ayer standing there.

02:32.000 --> 02:33.762
He said, do you have a roommate yet?

02:34.603 --> 02:35.283
And I said, no.

02:35.303 --> 02:37.606
He said, well, I never bothered to check out of this place.

02:38.767 --> 02:43.012
So he said, I said, yeah, I hadn't already told that many of you been gone.

02:43.032 --> 02:45.955
I was just sitting there wondering if I can get away with not having a roommate.

02:45.975 --> 02:49.138
If I don't bring it up, then maybe it's half a semester before they know.

02:49.591 --> 02:51.613
And he never talked about why.

02:51.814 --> 02:52.574
He came back.

02:53.195 --> 02:54.817
He said, I don't want to talk about it.

02:55.017 --> 02:59.142
He said, I'm not going to complain anymore, and came back.

02:59.623 --> 03:07.412
But we had a friend that was in the Corps, came from Pample with us, and he'd come over once in a while and wanted to know if we'd go home with him, and we wouldn't.

03:07.432 --> 03:10.816
Then next week, we were ready to go home, but he wasn't.

03:10.836 --> 03:15.141
And so if all three of us ever got together and said, yeah, let's go, we'd have probably gone.

03:15.161 --> 03:16.442
But always one of us would...

03:17.384 --> 03:30.111
He was in the Corps, he was an accounting major, a friend of ours, and he flunked his first accounting course and went through the Corps, and now he's a CPA and a controller of a big corporation.

03:30.395 --> 03:34.259
Anyway, he hung in there and became a marine jet pilot.

03:34.299 --> 03:39.124
And normally you all went home only at Thanksgiving and Christmas and Easter?

03:40.225 --> 03:41.326
Sometimes Thanksgiving.

03:42.327 --> 03:43.068
But not always.

03:43.448 --> 03:44.209
But no other time.

03:45.630 --> 03:48.754
And Easter I had track meets a lot of times.

03:48.794 --> 03:53.799
So really in the summer, and then that got limited too for me competing.

03:53.819 --> 03:55.581
And then one summer we worked down in Houston.

03:55.601 --> 03:58.984
Thought we'd make a lot of money and ended up spending more than we made.

03:58.964 --> 04:02.249
All right, still on moments.

04:02.289 --> 04:03.671
Do you remember some goofy moments?

04:04.752 --> 04:08.117
You know, so where the person said, no, no, no, that couldn't happen.

04:14.506 --> 04:16.229
Nobody threw a smoke bomb in your room?

04:16.409 --> 04:17.851
Oh, we had, you know, a lot of that.

04:18.031 --> 04:22.978
I mean, that was so normal, I think, that you didn't pay a lot of attention to that.

04:23.179 --> 04:25.382
A lot of mischief like that went on in those days.

04:26.904 --> 04:27.705
But I really can't.

04:28.377 --> 04:30.341
specific on a lot of that.

04:33.166 --> 04:36.412
Serious moments, touchingly serious.

04:36.432 --> 04:39.337
You didn't have a good friend who got hurt or died.

04:40.119 --> 04:45.829
Well, you know, my friend and teammate, Jim Sebastian,

04:46.687 --> 04:52.592
call me on the phone today just to remind me it's been 34 years to the day since he was in the automobile accident in Houston.

04:52.612 --> 04:54.974
He's, I mean, Lubbock, we're the ones that went out there.

04:54.994 --> 04:55.695
So I have to call him.

04:55.715 --> 04:56.656
He left me a message.

04:56.676 --> 04:58.577
You remember it's been 34 years?

04:58.858 --> 05:10.127
And so, but, you know, and watching him come back out and trying to, and he said he'd never walk, and he tried to run and actually ran in a meter or two.

05:10.147 --> 05:11.108
He couldn't run very fast.

05:11.168 --> 05:13.590
He's 800, but he's the toughest guy I've ever known.

05:14.411 --> 05:14.952
Tenacious.

05:16.113 --> 05:16.693
And, uh,

05:16.673 --> 05:26.608
Well, it's kind of an inspiration to us and he's the one I've been real close to that really had something like that happen to him.

05:26.628 --> 05:34.901
You read about him, but to know someone that really came back and did what he did to try to get back.

05:36.503 --> 05:40.069
You said pranks were, did you ever go into the steam tunnels?

05:40.609 --> 05:41.010
No.

05:41.952 --> 05:43.859
But you heard about them.

05:43.879 --> 05:44.502
Oh, yeah.

05:44.522 --> 05:45.345
You guys did.

05:45.385 --> 05:45.987
That was dumb.

05:46.108 --> 05:49.962
I wasn't afraid I'd get stuck or something, you know.

05:49.982 --> 05:52.030
When you were, when you graduated,

05:52.634 --> 05:56.019
How well prepared did you think you were for the real world?

05:56.640 --> 06:03.110
Well, I went to, right out of school, I went to work for a stock brokerage firm and had to go to New York.

06:03.190 --> 06:10.361
In those days, if you were with a major firm, I was with Payne Weber, and we had to go to school for two and a half months to then take the exam.

06:11.783 --> 06:14.347
And I was very well prepared for that.

06:15.348 --> 06:21.257
And I didn't run into anything up there that was really a challenge to me that I hadn't

06:21.608 --> 06:26.734
had an A&M in business and the College of Business in those days wasn't the strongest college on campus.

06:26.815 --> 06:28.463
It just, matter of fact,

06:29.050 --> 06:35.856
gone from a part of liberal arts to a college of its own while I was in school and was just taking off.

06:36.057 --> 06:39.059
But I was very well prepared and we had CPAs.

06:39.139 --> 06:48.168
Most of the people in those days when the brokerage business had been out of school five to 10 years and most of them were CPAs or attorneys or something.

06:48.248 --> 06:55.935
In hindsight, who were the people in accounting that deserve credit for your being well prepared?

07:00.016 --> 07:23.138
Well, when I left here I had Dan Lowe in accounting and he's, I had him for, matter of fact he might have been the only one I had, and I had a fellow in corporate finance, the name of Adams that you know, that's still here.

07:26.864 --> 07:28.767
He came back out of industry.

07:29.208 --> 07:29.548
What is his name?

07:29.568 --> 07:31.311
He's still here in town.

07:31.491 --> 07:31.812
Adams.

07:35.097 --> 07:37.180
And he really prepared.

07:37.380 --> 07:40.345
Not JQ or something like that.

07:40.365 --> 07:42.267
You know what I'm talking about.

07:42.287 --> 07:46.935
And he really had to learn all these formulas and stuff and gripe and moan about it.

07:46.995 --> 07:49.318
But that was a lot of the test.

07:49.358 --> 07:50.640
What about Herb Thompson?

07:50.680 --> 07:51.922
Herb Thompson was marketing.

07:52.723 --> 07:53.284
Oh, okay.

07:53.565 --> 07:55.808
But he was...

07:56.480 --> 08:01.408
You know, a lot that when I got into, and later on that, even with association, I benefited from his.

08:03.231 --> 08:05.975
You know, for marketing, there's marketing and everything.

08:06.036 --> 08:10.743
And he really had us prepared in that marketing research and things like that.

08:11.304 --> 08:18.135
But, you know, in those days I think it was more the overall education and the discipline and the confidence.

08:18.416 --> 08:23.584
When you left here you felt like, you know, there was a, there was a,

08:24.256 --> 08:47.040
perception whether it's reality or not that if you came out of A&M employers said you did better and you're better prepared and all that and you we really believe that so what you know a lot of times the perception is more important in reality and we thought you know I used to think if I was better trained and worked harder than anybody they couldn't beat me well I think the same thing with Aggies in those days I'm not sure that

08:47.965 --> 09:03.243
I know we weren't any smarter, but, you know, maybe the discipline a little bit and maybe a little bit of the sacrifice, you know, of having to put up with some things you wouldn't normally have to put up with at a school that kind of better prepared us for those things in business.

09:03.263 --> 09:07.969
At least there was a strong perception and we'd heard a lot about that being the case.

09:09.190 --> 09:16.639
If you had all of the people back that you had any association with while you were here,

09:17.092 --> 09:28.668
students, faculty, staff, former students, et cetera, to which ones would you most want to express your appreciation and gratitude as you look back what they meant to you?

09:30.030 --> 09:43.909
Well, I think on the athletic side, of course, Coach Thomas, Mr. Mameliga, I think those two, over a long period of time,

09:45.458 --> 09:48.283
that did a lot for me that I'm indebted to them for.

09:48.863 --> 09:57.838
Academically, I think that faculty members like Herb Thompson and, you know, I'm sure there's a lot of them I'm not thinking about.

09:57.858 --> 10:04.108
If you mention their name, I'd say, you know, that I can't remember the specifics.

10:04.493 --> 10:11.234
came out of it thinking, you know, they care about you and, well, Bayless was one of my history professors way back then.

10:11.796 --> 10:18.317
He probably doesn't have very good memories of that, but, you know, it's just people that taught you and

10:18.905 --> 10:27.982
And in a way that most of my professors cared whether, you know, you did well or not instead of just throw it out there and get it if you wanted.

10:29.325 --> 10:36.298
And, you know, I think General Rutter had an impact even though I wasn't with him all that much.

10:38.222 --> 10:39.985
I think that

10:39.965 --> 10:43.329
Donnie Ayers, my roommate, made it possible.

10:43.590 --> 10:55.124
Ted Nelson, some of those guys, being around them, the friends that I had, made it where you felt comfortable and, you know, at home, so.

10:56.065 --> 10:57.727
And I may have already asked this.

10:58.008 --> 11:00.090
To whom did you turn for academic advice?

11:00.170 --> 11:02.293
What courses to take or not to take?

11:02.425 --> 11:04.729
Well, we talked about it.

11:04.849 --> 11:05.770
Oh, okay.

11:05.850 --> 11:07.613
And Buddy Denton.

11:07.633 --> 11:09.156
Oh, Buddy Denton, yeah.

11:09.176 --> 11:12.621
But see, in those days, it wasn't a lot, you didn't have many electives to take.

11:12.641 --> 11:18.190
I mean, you know, you had, remember the old, the catalog, and it had a slot in there for electives, maybe two.

11:18.743 --> 11:24.518
And then you'd go in there later after you, you know, that was first for athletics, you know, to help you.

11:24.558 --> 11:28.267
And he helped us a lot to get our schedules blocked where we could work out and everything.

11:28.307 --> 11:32.618
But after a while, you go see Herb Thompson.

11:32.638 --> 11:35.385
And because I remember he told me I need to take philosophy.

11:36.344 --> 11:39.031
And I tried to explain to him, I didn't think that was my strong point.

11:39.132 --> 11:40.916
He said, it's probably not, but you need to take it.

11:41.017 --> 11:45.970
And he put me in a public relations course that was a journalism course.

11:46.732 --> 11:48.356
I didn't think, I didn't know it was journalism.

11:48.417 --> 11:50.843
I got in there with a bunch of journalism students and philosophy.

11:51.700 --> 11:56.104
And I didn't like either one of them, but I got some things out of them, I think, that benefited me.

11:56.124 --> 12:00.988
And he said I needed, you know, a better, well-rounded education out of the place.

12:02.049 --> 12:08.916
And Herb Thompson was the kind of guy, when he kind of suggested it, it was kind of like the way it was going to be.

12:08.956 --> 12:11.378
It was like General Rudder saying, you need to go do this.

12:11.498 --> 12:14.781
And it was hard not to do what they said.

12:15.281 --> 12:18.544
And normally your academic load was how many credit hours?

12:18.985 --> 12:21.707
16 or 17 hours, depending on whether I had a lab.

12:21.687 --> 12:26.835
I try to never take more than that because that would get you out in four years in those days.

12:26.876 --> 12:38.815
Taking 17 until you got rid of the biology and the geology and the stuff with the labs and then 16 the rest of the time would get you out in eight semesters.

12:39.296 --> 12:39.596
All right.

12:39.617 --> 12:42.621
Now have we not touched anything that you want to be sure to include?

12:44.985 --> 12:46.007
Anything we've overlooked?

12:47.573 --> 12:48.376
I don't think so.

12:48.617 --> 12:54.521
All right, then the last question is, what feelings do you carry in your heart for Texas A&M today?

12:55.064 --> 12:57.634
Well, I think that I wouldn't have accomplished

13:01.462 --> 13:07.530
First, the athletic goals that I had were very important to me when I showed up here.

13:07.850 --> 13:16.661
I already at that time knew kind of where I hoped to end up, and I did that, and I think I wouldn't have done it anywhere else.

13:17.302 --> 13:29.477
I may be wrong because I didn't experience that, but I feel that way, and I feel like from that point of view, I went to the very best place I could have gone to, and that's for a lot of reasons, for the support I got, the interest in me,

13:29.913 --> 13:37.765
individually, a lack of distractions, the total support in those days from everybody, from your faculty, the students.

13:38.586 --> 13:45.337
I carried into the Olympic Stadium with me in 1968 in my shot put bag a telegram with 10,000 names on it.

13:47.060 --> 13:47.781
I still have that.

13:48.382 --> 13:53.710
And that came from the MSC.

13:55.057 --> 13:58.642
Put a little pressure on you, though, because you realize that I've got to go back and face them.

13:58.662 --> 13:59.803
That's what I told everybody.

13:59.823 --> 14:00.664
Was that encouragement?

14:00.704 --> 14:02.467
I said, no, that scared me to death.

14:02.507 --> 14:05.470
I've got to go back and face all those people if I don't do well.

14:06.071 --> 14:08.394
And I felt a little of that.

14:09.375 --> 14:11.879
And I got from A&M a pride in being an Aggie.

14:12.059 --> 14:16.845
And I don't know why that is, but any time somebody said, you go to A&M,

14:18.817 --> 14:20.499
I feel proud of that, you know.

14:21.361 --> 14:23.103
I feel proud saying I'm class of 67.

14:23.263 --> 14:33.679
And, you know, a lot of things you say, well, I could have been a doctor or a lawyer or something maybe a little more exciting than alumni director, even though I was honored to get to be the alumni director here.

14:34.179 --> 14:38.185
But I can't think of any place I'd rather say I'm a graduate of.

14:40.008 --> 14:40.909
I think that's a great story.
