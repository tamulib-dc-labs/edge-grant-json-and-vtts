WEBVTT

00:02.005 --> 00:30.898
we were talking about previous planning 
directors and the different contributions they

00:02.005 --> 00:30.898
have made and in what ways they may have been unique 
in contributing to planning in austin the next

00:02.005 --> 00:30.898
planning director was mike mahoney and how would 
you characterize his contributions or his

00:02.005 --> 00:30.898
emphasis that impacted planning in austin well 
actually he was here i think a good bit longer than

00:02.005 --> 00:30.898
bill parker and i think that he actually saw the 
department grow from just a few staff members to a

00:31.283 --> 00:37.070
fairly sizable staff. A lot of the current mapping 
that was started under Mike Mahoney, he

00:37.451 --> 00:54.673
worked toward the first master plan that was 
adopted by the city. The consultant, I believe,

00:55.874 --> 00:59.839
was hired during his

01:01.270 --> 01:11.189
So I think that he was very influential in getting 
the first plan for Austin. And the next planning

01:11.330 --> 01:13.153
director was? Oral Osborn. And his contributions 
to the park and to the city as regards to planning?

01:18.989 --> 01:22.454
Well, one thing I would say that it continued. The 
plan, I think, was adopted, I believe, after Hoyle

01:24.397 --> 01:37.937
took

01:24.397 --> 01:37.937
Mike's place, if I have my dates right. And I think 
that Hoyle, too, worked with neighborhoods. He

01:43.165 --> 01:47.832
was very concerned about neighborhood 
preservation.

01:49.583 --> 01:51.625
He's very environmentally concerned. He has 
always been interested in the protection of the

01:52.046 --> 01:59.254
water system, the lake area, and the hill country. 
So all in all, all our, I think, planning directors

01:59.935 --> 02:07.323
have been really very dedicated in preserving 
Austin. Can you give me an idea approximately when

02:09.946 --> 02:17.835
Mr. Mahoney and Mr. Osborne began working as 
director in the department? Well, Mr. Mahoney was

02:19.098 --> 02:24.604
the director when I came to work in 1955. He was also 
here in 54 when I worked part-time, when I worked

02:25.345 --> 02:31.932
one summer. So I think that Mike might have been 
here, he either came in 52 or 53, I believe. And I

02:40.862 --> 02:48.531
believe that he left, oh, more than likely, close 
to the 60s, or late 50s, and then while Osborne

02:50.536 --> 02:59.429
became the director. And he was director until Mr. 
Lilly came along, which was when? I can't, well, I

03:04.216 --> 03:11.987
believe that Mr. Lilly has been director about 
eight years. I'm not sure if it's 72 or in that

03:12.068 --> 03:14.451
ballpark. And each planning director, of course, 
has a different type of emphasis, different

03:15.460 --> 03:23.799
fields of interest, and that impacts the fields of 
planning within Austin. What would you say the

03:23.819 --> 03:27.527
role of outside consultants has been in planning 
in Austin? Have they been valuable? Yes, they have

03:28.610 --> 03:30.634
been. Now, we had a consultant, of course, way back 
in 1928, and I cannot give you how much influence

03:30.884 --> 03:41.414
that consultant had. However, there were some 
zoning categories that were developed as a result

03:41.514 --> 03:54.226
of his plan, and I think that that does affect the 
community. The next consultants that I'm aware of

03:54.807 --> 03:58.410
would be the Farron Granger, And, of course, the 
influence on the thoroughfare plan that was

03:58.778 --> 04:03.702
adopted by the Council at that time. And then... 
Approximately 61. No, that was in the 50s, early

04:06.545 --> 04:10.408
50s. And the next one was specific planning and 
research, or the Harold Wise Group out of

04:11.128 --> 04:17.213
California. They changed title while they were 
working for us. And they were the ones who were the

04:22.138 --> 04:28.583
consultants for the plan that was adopted in 61. 
The plan that was written by them was much more

04:29.137 --> 04:35.866
comprehensive than the one that was adopted. And 
you would say that even to this day, outside

04:37.407 --> 04:41.332
consultants play a valuable role. Oh, yes. At this 
time, how are they utilized? Well, at this time, we

04:44.657 --> 04:56.832
have a consultant from California who is working 
on the revision or the rewrite or new revision or

04:57.217 --> 05:00.562
every way you might want to call it, zoning 
ordinance. And so they are drawing, of course,

05:00.582 --> 05:24.439
from their expertise and experience throughout 
the country in regard to zoning, and I feel as

05:00.582 --> 05:24.439
though that it will be quite influential, or they 
will be quite influential on Austin if that

05:00.582 --> 05:24.439
ordinance is adopted. Several types of factors 
influence planning in the community, and I'd like

05:26.714 --> 05:32.823
to go over some of these. What type of political 
influences have impacted planning in Austin?

05:40.815 --> 05:45.061
Well, that's, I think, one of the more difficult 
questions that we have. We have the state capitol,

05:45.122 --> 05:49.448
of course, here.

05:50.727 --> 05:56.715
We are affected, I think, because the state 
legislation takes place here. And I don't think

05:57.637 --> 06:03.064
you can be completely immune from that. So even 
though our local politics are separate, I think

06:03.485 --> 06:11.335
there's a certain influence, even from the state 
politics. Locally,

06:13.278 --> 06:20.548
the political picture, I think, has changed in 
recent years. It used to be where we had, I would

06:22.030 --> 06:46.300
say, a fairly stable old school

06:22.030 --> 06:46.300
political situation, where we had a lot of the 
Alstonites

06:22.030 --> 06:46.300
who were from old families who carried a lot of 
influence on the entire political picture. I

06:51.284 --> 07:09.119
don't know whether you recall Tom Miller, but he 
was one of our most influential mayors, a very

06:51.284 --> 07:09.119
strong mayor, a very dedicated person wanting 
Austin to be as good as possible. He, I think, had

07:11.061 --> 07:16.405
some far-reaching theories, just like he was the 
one who influenced the acquisition of City Park

07:16.570 --> 07:27.020
way out in the lake when he had a lot of opposition, 
but he was a strong man and he accomplished it. That

07:27.541 --> 07:28.842
was when approximately? Oh, goodness. I don't 
know the year, but again, it was quite a number of

07:30.584 --> 07:35.749
years ago. So I feel as though that we've had some 
very strong political figures. The mayor who was

07:46.557 --> 07:50.342
in office at the time that the 61 plan was adopted. 
The 61 plan had been prepared and completed in 58,

07:51.764 --> 08:00.955
and it had been more or less dormant because we had a 
good bit of opposition to it. But at that time,

08:02.537 --> 08:14.472
Lester Palmer was our mayor, and he felt very 
strongly about it, and he knew that he was not going

08:02.537 --> 08:14.472
to run for office again, and he decided that he 
would He wanted, I think, to see the plan adopted.

08:17.859 --> 08:20.624
And he made a special effort in working on it. And 
even though it was

08:21.325 --> 08:32.602
not as comprehensive as the original one had been 
written, it was modified. And he helped with the

08:32.983 --> 08:40.915
revision of it so that it was acceptable to the 
political community, and we got it adopted. In

08:46.264 --> 08:54.558
cities that utilize a city manager, occasionally 
the city manager will have a good deal of influence

08:46.264 --> 08:54.558
on planning. Has this been the case in Austin? Yes. 
Actually, when I came, I think Walter C. Holm, I

09:05.144 --> 09:08.149
believe, was city manager. And then Mr. W.T. 
Williams came in, and he worked very closely with

09:10.573 --> 09:15.101
us. He was a former city attorney. He, I think, had 
been involved in writing of a number of the

09:17.825 --> 09:27.962
ordinances, like involved in subdivision and 
zoning.

09:29.056 --> 09:33.661
actually kept his finger on the pulse of every part 
of the community in Austin. In other words, he

09:33.681 --> 09:37.466
wanted to know what was going on in every area. And 
he was the type of person who never took a vacation.

09:41.110 --> 09:45.134
I mean, his work, I think he loved his work. And I 
think that for that reason, he wanted to know every

09:45.154 --> 09:49.880
angle of it. I know that at the time that we were 
working on Interstate 35. I was one of the new young

09:58.667 --> 10:17.651
planners at that time and this was when Tom Miller 
was in office and they wanted a model of what

09:58.667 --> 10:17.651
interstate was going to look like. And here I was 
fairly fresh out of the university and I got the job

10:17.671 --> 10:23.278
to build it and Tom Miller always stayed 
interested in it. And Mr. Williams, he would, I'd

10:28.175 --> 10:36.804
be working late at night, Mr. Williams would come 
up and, I mean, he had first-hand interest in

10:28.175 --> 10:36.804
everything that was going on. I mean, he wanted 
progress for the community, but again, he kept

10:36.944 --> 10:44.651
posted on everything that was happening. And 
let's say in the present, the present city manager

10:46.914 --> 10:52.219
is... Dan Davidson. And what kind of influence has 
he had on planning and the planning department in

10:53.833 --> 10:58.098
Austin? Well, I think that he, too, is very 
planning-oriented. In fact, I think some of his

11:01.662 --> 11:04.986
background includes planning. And I think that 
he, of course, wants the very best for Austin, and I

11:06.028 --> 11:21.987
think he recognizes that one of the ways of 
accomplishing the best for Austin is to have a

11:06.028 --> 11:21.987
good, comprehensive plan that can be followed. 
Would you say that religious factors have been a

11:23.840 --> 11:28.490
significant influence on planning in Austin?

11:34.022 --> 11:35.144
Maybe to a degree. We have several religious 
schools here. We have St. Edward's. all Concordia

11:42.487 --> 12:08.730
and the Presbyterian seminary and of course they 
take out blocks of land that affect us physically

11:42.487 --> 12:08.730
the tax base and the tax base so I think it has as far 
as you know the religious community otherwise I

11:42.487 --> 12:08.730
don't think that it has some in other words we do not 
have

12:10.533 --> 12:17.419
We're not made up of just basically one religion 
that would more or less establish the rules for the

12:10.533 --> 12:17.419
city. I think that we have enough variation here so 
that I don't think that it's been a major

12:17.439 --> 12:29.670
influencing factor. How have different ethnic 
groups been an influence on planning throughout

12:31.312 --> 12:40.320
the history of Austin?

12:41.465 --> 12:44.008
I'm not sure whether they were involved a great 
deal. I don't think that they were involved. They

12:47.192 --> 12:49.775
have become involved in recent years. In fact, we 
have quite a number of groups who are very vocal in

12:51.558 --> 12:59.888
regard to the planning for Austin. There is a 
tendency for some of them to want to do all of their

13:00.989 --> 13:07.017
own planning. regardless of whether they own the 
property or not. If they live in the area, they want

13:11.683 --> 13:14.247
the full control of it. And I think that this is... I 
have found that the minority groups are...

13:18.533 --> 13:27.166
How can I put it? A small section of them are very, 
very vocal and... do not want to compromise. I

13:40.426 --> 13:43.690
think that's about the only way I can put it at this 
time. I found that in other areas there's more of a

13:44.431 --> 13:56.967
compromise and a let's work out the problem.

13:58.195 --> 14:05.863
We've had a few instances recently where the 
group, this is what we want, we won't take anything

13:58.195 --> 14:05.863
else. And so I think that there can be some 
instances where it can affect the community. Do

14:17.235 --> 14:25.924
you see that in the planning department dealing 
with minority groups through whether it be

14:17.235 --> 14:25.924
independent or representing neighborhood 
action-type groups, that they have their own

14:26.427 --> 14:37.587
neighborhood concerns, typically, or they have a 
comprehensive viewpoint and a large-scale view

14:26.427 --> 14:37.587
of the city as an area? They do not take a 
large-scale view, but very few neighborhoods do

14:37.607 --> 14:42.295
this. I mean, I think that that's across the board. 
Most of them, I think, take a very narrow view. One

14:49.630 --> 15:00.806
of the things that I think, and I don't think this is 
just in the ethnic groups, I don't think it deals

14:49.630 --> 15:00.806
only with that. I think that any neighborhood 
tends to focus in on their problems and how they are

15:01.307 --> 15:09.638
affected. Now, one of the things that I have 
noticed over and over again, and that is that if the

15:10.099 --> 15:19.232
planning department or an outside agency 
suggests something for the community, they're

15:19.702 --> 15:26.729
immediately suspicious. They feel as though that 
we're trying to do something to them, not for them.

15:34.278 --> 15:46.030
And we had a case a number of years ago, and I think 
this will illustrate it, where we were trying to

15:34.278 --> 15:46.030
roll back a large area of East Austin from 
industrial to residential, because the area was

15:46.685 --> 16:00.626
developed residentially with small lots, and we 
did not want industries to come in and disrupt the

15:46.685 --> 16:00.626
neighborhood. We proposed it, and you just 
wouldn't believe the opposition that we got. They

16:05.673 --> 16:09.078
felt as though we were trying to take something 
away from them. Last year, we had a group come in.

16:16.013 --> 16:18.836
And it was more or less initiated by themselves for 
a rollback.

16:22.559 --> 16:28.845
The neighborhood leaders were supposed to have 
met with everybody to try to inform them. But even

16:29.346 --> 16:35.792
at that, we had a few people at the hearings who felt 
as though somebody was trying to pull something.

16:36.973 --> 16:42.358
They're immediately suspicious, even though we 
have, say, the same concerns that they have, the

16:43.418 --> 16:50.908
protection of the neighborhood. How have 
geographic factors influenced planning in

16:50.928 --> 16:56.355
Austin, centralized location, etc.? One thing, 
we are on the edge of the hill country. So as you

17:03.904 --> 17:12.936
know, part of our city is, part of our very best 
development is in the hill country. what used to be

17:13.777 --> 17:16.562
considered west of Austin. It's not west of Austin 
anymore. It's part of Austin. And then, of course,

17:20.369 --> 17:24.617
we have the farmlands east of Austin and south. So, 
of course, you might be talking about the

17:25.760 --> 17:33.895
geographic in the relationship that we're on 
Interstate 35. where between, say, Houston and

17:34.246 --> 17:54.068
Waco, I mean, San Antonio and Waco, if that's the 
sort of thing that you're talking about, I think

17:34.246 --> 17:54.068
that

17:34.246 --> 17:54.068
being close to these other large cities is an 
advantage. We're far enough away still. A lot of

17:55.890 --> 18:03.358
people consider Austin a small town, which it 
isn't anymore, but it still has a lot of... or

18:04.148 --> 18:09.118
unique characteristics that the big cities of 
Houston and Dallas don't have. And so I think that

18:10.099 --> 18:26.511
being still close to these centers, because it 
doesn't take long to get to Dallas or Houston, you

18:10.099 --> 18:26.511
can fly there very, very quickly if you need to, but 
still you can have a better place to live by being in

18:10.099 --> 18:26.511
Austin. The other thing, when we're talking about 
topography, geography, whatever way you want to

18:27.470 --> 18:41.529
get into that, we have the variety that Houston and 
Dallas don't have. San Antonio has some of it, but

18:41.929 --> 18:48.979
again, I still think that Austin has the very best, 
because it has a little of everything. How has this

18:50.340 --> 18:55.367
played a role in, let's say, choosing Austin for 
the capital site originally? Well, I think that

18:55.651 --> 19:03.864
that is one reason it was chosen, is because it was 
on the edge of the various areas. It's fairly

19:03.924 --> 19:06.454
centrally located. Really, Austin is unique, and 
I think our forefathers saw this. How about

19:10.569 --> 19:11.631
waterways? Of course, the Colorado River had... I 
think waterways have a major influence on the

19:15.075 --> 19:25.627
settlement of any community, and I think the 
Colorado River is our lifeline.

19:28.791 --> 19:36.120
Sociological factors such as population, 
education of the populace here... income levels

19:36.809 --> 19:40.475
and that affected planning in Austin? Well, one 
thing, because of the university being here,

19:40.495 --> 20:05.112
because of San Marcos and Georgetown being close 
by, they're smaller universities, I think that

19:40.495 --> 20:05.112
our educational,

19:40.495 --> 20:05.112
the availability of varying types of educational 
levels, again, I've have not looked at the

20:06.003 --> 20:16.299
figures, but I would dare say that the educational 
level of Austinites tends to be a little higher in

20:06.003 --> 20:16.299
most communities just because it's readily 
available. And we have also some of the local

20:17.080 --> 20:22.909
religious schools here. So we do have an influx of 
some people who are going to the seminaries and so

20:23.329 --> 20:28.597
on. How has this influenced planning? Has it been 
an influence? I think it has been an influence. I

20:35.804 --> 21:01.018
think that people in Austin, a lot of the people who 
are interested in the betterment of the

20:35.804 --> 21:01.018
community, the fact that they have been exposed to 
it as they got their training at the universities,

20:35.804 --> 21:01.018
as they participated in activities, they became 
more knowledgeable. And I think that they have a

21:01.285 --> 21:07.974
greater interest as a result in Austin being the 
best possible place. So you feel possibly that

21:08.455 --> 21:13.282
this has had an impact in citizen group 
participation and organization. Oh yes, very

21:13.302 --> 21:13.883
definitely. Directly as a result of these 
factors.

21:19.230 --> 21:23.596
Economic influences, we've spoken earlier, have 
had an impact on planning. On the whole, how would

21:24.938 --> 21:30.786
you characterize the importance of economic 
factors here in planning?

21:33.061 --> 21:46.621
I think that the fact that we have been fairly 
stable up until just a couple years ago, Austin had

21:33.061 --> 21:46.621
the reputation of never losing a bond election. 
And suddenly we've lost a few. What was the first,

21:51.348 --> 21:52.731
for example? Oh, goodness. It might have been two 
or three years ago. Not very long ago. And I think

22:00.350 --> 22:08.697
that before that, Austin was more of a close-knit 
community. They did not have the outside influx at

22:11.140 --> 22:21.289
that time as much, and they wanted the best for the 
community, and they were willing to pay for it. Now

22:23.131 --> 22:25.393
we've ended up with... more people from outside 
and unfortunately a lot of them feel now that i'm

22:27.365 --> 22:56.055
here i want to close the door i don't want any more 
people to come it's nice as it is i don't want to mess

22:27.365 --> 22:56.055
it up because we have kept our standards high 
that's the reason it is as desirable as it is

22:27.365 --> 22:56.055
problem that we're going to have is that as the city 
grows there's more demand for services Your

22:56.457 --> 23:00.845
efficiency, the larger you get, the more your 
efficiency drops off. So per capita, I'm sure that

23:01.506 --> 23:11.745
it's going to cost us more to operate the city and to 
provide the services that people want, partly

23:01.506 --> 23:11.745
because we are larger in the physical sense. We 
have to extend our services further and further

23:12.927 --> 23:16.373
out. and partly because the people are coming in 
with suburban sprawl that we would like to

23:16.353 --> 23:26.321
discourage but this is what the people want. They 
do not want concentrations and so the services

23:26.361 --> 23:46.258
continue to go up because they need to be extended 
further and further and the very people who are

23:26.361 --> 23:46.258
speaking against it are the ones who are moving 
into these areas and I don't know how we can

23:48.398 --> 23:52.924
settle that issue because in itself it is a 
contradiction. But I think that all we can do is to

23:54.806 --> 24:13.849
try to work with it, but it does affect the economic

23:54.806 --> 24:13.849
capability of continuing to provide the services 
that people want without increasing taxes. I see a

24:14.723 --> 24:17.347
number of conflicts on the economic front. You 
mentioned earlier that over 50% of the land area in

24:18.268 --> 24:25.879
Austin cannot be taxed by the city of Austin. You 
mentioned the desirability because of its

24:26.540 --> 24:36.934
location next to the hill country, recreational 
opportunities, influx of population would

24:38.467 --> 24:43.932
naturally be occurring here because industries 
are attracted to make up for that lack of tax base.

24:43.952 --> 24:49.638
On the other hand, growth management has to be 
considered and has been considered in the Austin

24:43.952 --> 24:49.638
Tomorrow Plan. What are some of the other ways 
historically that Austin has tried to deal with

24:50.579 --> 24:54.963
this conflict through planning?

25:02.150 --> 25:08.136
In regard to establishing

25:02.150 --> 25:08.136
areas that We've tried to encourage the higher 
intensity uses to happen on the major arterioles.

25:16.326 --> 25:23.239
We have hoped that by encouraging the high 
intensity uses that might be traffic generators

25:23.742 --> 25:28.507
so that maybe a mass transit system can function. 
And that goes back into our economics, because

25:29.008 --> 25:37.436
right now, without government assistance, we 
would be running at a tremendous deficit, I'm

25:29.008 --> 25:37.436
sure. It's difficult to maintain the service and 
still keep the prices down. But all of it goes back

25:45.845 --> 25:53.293
into the fact that Austinites

25:45.845 --> 25:53.293
moved here. because we have a lot of amenities. The 
amenities cost money. And there is always kind of a

25:59.819 --> 26:06.768
break point when people say that I can't afford 
this anymore. But you get young families in, and

26:08.029 --> 26:14.557
many times they do not see this correlation. And 
when it comes right down to it, there are very few

26:16.239 --> 26:23.128
people who have the

26:23.969 --> 26:34.623
interest of the full community at heart unless it 
affects them some way or benefits them in some way.

26:35.504 --> 26:46.419
And you'll find that, for instance, people who 
have a number of children in schools, they'll tend

26:35.504 --> 26:46.419
to vote for the bond program for improvement in any 
of the school system. You will find that because of

26:47.420 --> 26:53.048
Austin now, we're ending up with a lot of retired 
people who are empty nesters. They are on fixed

26:58.257 --> 27:00.661
income. They don't use the streets very much. They 
don't get out there during peak hours anymore.

27:09.675 --> 27:10.596
They're set. They're not trying to move into 
another home, out into another area or anything

27:11.999 --> 27:17.107
like that. Any growth to them is... infringement 
upon their right to privacy. That's right. And so

27:25.052 --> 27:35.691
they, I think most of them, will tend to vote 
against any improvements, either to the school

27:25.052 --> 27:35.691
system, street system, or for any gross even if it 
might be in what we call our selected growth

27:36.228 --> 27:42.397
corridor, because they have really no interest in 
it. All it will do is to possibly raise their taxes,

27:42.837 --> 27:46.983
and they can't afford it. So because of, say, the 
retirement situation, and, for instance,

27:47.844 --> 27:54.574
universities, University has a tremendous 
effect on this, too, because they can vote. And

27:59.343 --> 28:03.047
most of those people, of course, a lot of them end up 
staying here. I did. And I know of a lot of my friends

28:04.048 --> 28:08.612
who did, because Austin is nice. But while they're 
at the university, they look at the things in a very

28:09.473 --> 28:17.781
theoretical sense. They don't realize the impact 
on the entire community, what, say, a bond

28:24.440 --> 28:31.189
election, how it might affect it if it's turned 
down versus whether it's passed. So we can end up

28:31.830 --> 28:43.326
with a lot of problems on the economic situation 
because of our makeup of university, a lot of

28:31.830 --> 28:43.326
retired people, military, the whole That was the 
next factor I was going to ask you about, that of the

28:44.302 --> 28:49.908
military influence on planning in Austin. Well, 
one thing that I had not covered earlier, which I

28:49.928 --> 29:04.383
should have, and that is the Bergstrom Air Force 
Base has affected a lot of our planning, physical

28:49.928 --> 29:04.383
planning, because of the sound and the noise 
factors around Bergstrom Air Force Base. We're

29:05.565 --> 29:10.630
recommending a lot of industrial development in 
the area where we have noise problems. And so that

29:11.352 --> 29:20.865
has affected our land use situation because some 
of that area is not desirable for residential

29:11.352 --> 29:20.865
because of noise or safety. I'm not sure I asked you 
earlier, but when did Bergstrom get rid of it? I

29:28.656 --> 29:29.377
can't tell you. I can't tell you offhand. Because I 
would say that more than likely in the late...

29:40.057 --> 29:41.198
thirties or early forties. And physical planning 
was to the greatest extent impacted by them? Yes.

29:50.368 --> 29:53.090
Now I can get that information for you if you'd like 
to have that. We'll get that at a later time then.

29:55.373 --> 30:02.380
Finally then, what would you, very briefly, could 
you describe the current status of planning in

29:55.373 --> 30:02.380
Austin? Well I think that we are Of course, I guess 
you'd consider that we'd be blowing our own horn. I

30:11.223 --> 30:16.289
think that Austin is about as advanced in regard to 
planning as any community can be. We have, I think,

30:17.751 --> 30:21.835
one of the most forward-looking planning 
directors we've ever had. We consider the public

30:23.297 --> 30:29.664
input from every group possible. We encourage 
public input.

30:36.217 --> 30:42.545
development community, investment community, 
to work within the framework of the community.

30:43.206 --> 30:45.969
Because they are going to be part of the community. 
They will either provide jobs for the community or

30:47.050 --> 30:51.416
provide a service to the community. And their 
income will be based on the community's support.

30:58.084 --> 30:59.465
We are one big family. And I think that we try to 
encourage the people to work together. Because a

31:06.237 --> 31:14.706
business locating in an area, they are not 
isolated from the residential. Their service

31:14.726 --> 31:17.449
area is the residential community. And so they 
should complement, they should provide a

31:18.130 --> 31:26.719
service, and that residential community should 
feel good about that commercial area being there.

31:27.740 --> 31:31.945
The same way about our transit system, same way 
about our thoroughfare system. It is there.
