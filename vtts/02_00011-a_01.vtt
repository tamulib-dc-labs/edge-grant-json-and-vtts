WEBVTT

00:00:03.136 --> 00:00:06.319
Testing, one, two, three, one, two, three.

00:00:09.483 --> 00:00:13.347
Testing, testing, three, two, one, three, two, one.

00:00:13.527 --> 00:00:15.449
Testing, testing.

00:00:15.469 --> 00:00:17.992
Testing on Wednesday, August 15.

00:00:18.973 --> 00:00:21.155
I'm Don Barker here with Haskell Monroe.

00:00:23.558 --> 00:00:24.919
This is August 15.

00:00:24.980 --> 00:00:30.105
We're in the Evans Library and I have the pleasure of chatting with Dr.

00:00:30.406 --> 00:00:31.207
Is it Donald?

00:00:31.367 --> 00:00:32.389
Donald G. Barker.

00:00:32.529 --> 00:00:39.638
Donald G. Barker, whose period of service here goes back a good many decades.

00:00:40.539 --> 00:00:49.811
To introduce yourself to someone who might hear this tape or read the transcription, describe Don Barker's life before Texas A&M.

00:00:49.851 --> 00:00:50.692
Where did you grow up?

00:00:50.752 --> 00:00:52.073
What did Mom and Dad do?

00:00:52.154 --> 00:00:57.240
Where did you go to school, high school, college, and any other experience before you got here?

00:00:57.912 --> 00:01:16.156
Okay, I go by Don Barker and I was born in 1929 in Waco, Texas and grew up in Waco and attended public schools there and went to Waco High School and after high school I went into the Army.

00:01:16.697 --> 00:01:18.199
I was in the Army for three years.

00:01:18.803 --> 00:01:22.189
Then when I came out of the Army, I was a student in my hometown at Baylor.

00:01:23.070 --> 00:01:28.239
I took the bachelor's and master's at Baylor, and then I went into employment service work.

00:01:28.299 --> 00:01:36.593
I worked for the Texas Employment Service, and then later for the Texas Rehabilitation Council.

00:01:36.573 --> 00:01:40.058
No, it was a state commission for the blind, and I was a rehabilitation counselor.

00:01:40.879 --> 00:01:49.110
And then after that, I worked for the state merit system council, which is a civil service testing program, but for state civil service.

00:01:49.931 --> 00:01:59.163
And it was from there that I came to, and I went to University of Texas and received the PhD in educational psychology, and I came from Austin here in 1959.

00:02:01.486 --> 00:02:04.690
How did you know there was a vacancy at A&M?

00:02:06.577 --> 00:02:09.785
I was registering at Texas.

00:02:10.366 --> 00:02:17.683
Each time you're required to go to your advisor, and the advisee ahead of me, the

00:02:18.440 --> 00:02:21.965
the advisor asked him if he'd be interested in a position at A&M.

00:02:22.927 --> 00:02:25.691
He said no, and I overheard that.

00:02:25.851 --> 00:02:34.504
When I came up, he checked my load at Texas, and I said, well, what about me?

00:02:34.604 --> 00:02:37.408
I heard you ask somebody if he was interested in a position at A&M.

00:02:37.428 --> 00:02:38.730
He said, well, are you?

00:02:39.111 --> 00:02:41.634
I said yes, and so that began it.

00:02:41.955 --> 00:02:42.976
Now, when was that?

00:02:43.197 --> 00:02:43.918
That was in 1959.

00:02:43.998 --> 00:02:48.244
It was the beginning of the fall semester.

00:02:48.798 --> 00:02:50.200
And you had already finished your degree.

00:02:50.440 --> 00:02:51.081
No, I had not.

00:02:51.241 --> 00:02:56.487
I was registering at that time and I finished my dissertation after I came over here.

00:02:56.888 --> 00:03:00.892
How did you make contact then with somebody over here about that vacancy?

00:03:02.294 --> 00:03:07.380
Well, I was given a referral to, I believe it was to Grady Parker.

00:03:08.041 --> 00:03:11.785
Grady Parker was a head of educational psychology and so I

00:03:12.237 --> 00:03:25.116
telephoned him and set up a conference for him, with him, and I was working still at the Texas Merit System Council and I arranged to come over for an evening interview.

00:03:25.754 --> 00:03:43.388
And so I came to Dr. Parker's office in the academic building, and I showed him some of my writing that I had done and my credentials, and we had a nice discussion.

00:03:43.508 --> 00:03:48.758
And then we went by to see Walter Vorville, who was in charge of the psychology portion

00:03:49.075 --> 00:03:51.039
of the Education and Psychology Department.

00:03:51.801 --> 00:03:55.248
And I had a conference with him that same evening.

00:03:56.049 --> 00:03:59.276
I was wined and dined at Black's Pharmacy.

00:03:59.296 --> 00:04:07.894
And Frank Hubert met us there, the three of us, or the four of us, Grady Parker, Walter Vorvel, Frank Hubert, and I.

00:04:07.874 --> 00:04:14.423
We discussed the appointment at the soda fountain, and I was, I believe I was hired on the spot.

00:04:14.483 --> 00:04:18.409
If not, it was only a few days before the appointment was confirmed.

00:04:18.429 --> 00:04:23.696
Do you remember anything about what they asked about, what they talked about in the interview?

00:04:25.799 --> 00:04:30.726
Yes, they asked, well they were particularly, the reason they invited me over

00:04:31.398 --> 00:04:37.188
was I had a background in psychological testing, and particularly in test construction.

00:04:37.488 --> 00:04:39.752
That's what I was doing with the Texas Merit Council.

00:04:39.772 --> 00:04:44.540
I was writing up these civil service tests, and that's what I was majoring in at the university.

00:04:44.580 --> 00:04:46.824
And I studied under Dr. H.T.

00:04:46.864 --> 00:04:50.149
Manuel, who's a noted authority in that field.

00:04:50.129 --> 00:04:52.332
I guess that's the only reason I was invited over here.

00:04:52.433 --> 00:05:03.950
So we talked about my qualifications to teach test and measurements and statistics and techniques of research and general psychology.

00:05:04.391 --> 00:05:04.851
I did that.

00:05:05.653 --> 00:05:07.876
And we talked about that.

00:05:09.799 --> 00:05:15.107
I remember Frank Hubert asked me if I drank or smoked.

00:05:16.724 --> 00:05:23.256
I was kind of surprised at that question, but I did not at that time, and still don't.

00:05:23.276 --> 00:05:26.281
Because I know he was a heavy smoker.

00:05:26.301 --> 00:05:27.583
He seemed to be glad that I didn't.

00:05:28.485 --> 00:05:31.330
I told him, no, I didn't drink or smoke, and I'm practically a virgin.

00:05:33.073 --> 00:05:38.563
Did they ask any other questions that in today's standards might be a little unusual?

00:05:40.872 --> 00:05:44.595
Well, no, they didn't.

00:05:44.676 --> 00:05:48.139
They didn't ask very many personal questions.

00:05:48.159 --> 00:05:49.420
They asked about my family.

00:05:49.620 --> 00:05:53.324
I'm married and have two children, and they were children then.

00:05:53.384 --> 00:05:54.104
They're grown now.

00:05:54.805 --> 00:05:57.207
But I think I was interested in that.

00:05:57.448 --> 00:06:02.132
Oh, and it was to be a one-year appointment.

00:06:03.113 --> 00:06:05.395
So I was, like you, it was one year.

00:06:06.356 --> 00:06:08.618
And then during the year, they...

00:06:09.847 --> 00:06:11.530
put me on a tenure track position.

00:06:11.790 --> 00:06:14.614
How long did it take for them to make the offer?

00:06:15.796 --> 00:06:16.978
Was it made that night?

00:06:18.080 --> 00:06:18.861
I was trying to think.

00:06:18.961 --> 00:06:19.782
I believe it was.

00:06:20.023 --> 00:06:23.929
To the best of my knowledge, we sealed the deal with a handshake.

00:06:24.370 --> 00:06:31.240
There weren't any papers involved, but we closed the deal right there in the Black's Pharmacy soda fountain.

00:06:31.320 --> 00:06:33.804
This is the only dollar and cent question I'll ask.

00:06:34.225 --> 00:06:35.507
What was the beginning salary?

00:06:35.527 --> 00:06:36.208
Do you remember?

00:06:36.374 --> 00:06:39.999
I think it was about $8,000.

00:06:40.260 --> 00:06:41.201
I believe that's correct.

00:06:41.241 --> 00:06:42.102
For 9 or 12?

00:06:42.122 --> 00:06:43.484
I believe that was for 9 months.

00:06:44.286 --> 00:06:53.379
Actually, I was here 34 years and worked 34 summers, but I believe that salary would be close to being correct, $8,000 for 9 months.

00:06:53.980 --> 00:06:56.403
What did they tell you your duties would be?

00:06:57.425 --> 00:07:03.073
Well, my first teaching assignment, and I believe they told me,

00:07:03.678 --> 00:07:24.555
right from the very beginning, either that night or the next day or two, I was to teach a graduate course in test and measurements, an undergraduate course in test and measurements, and I believe it was two or three sections of general introductory psychology.

00:07:24.822 --> 00:07:26.684
And the normal teaching load then was?

00:07:27.365 --> 00:07:31.829
I think it was about 12 semester hours, 12 or 15.

00:07:32.490 --> 00:07:35.513
Sometimes it was 15, but typically 12 semester hours.

00:07:36.054 --> 00:07:37.395
And you began in September.

00:07:37.435 --> 00:07:39.117
When was this interview session?

00:07:39.898 --> 00:07:54.053
It was right, it was an emergency for them because it was just weeks, you know, very few weeks, less than a month before the beginning of the fall semester.

00:07:54.438 --> 00:08:02.533
I had to finish my work I was doing in Austin, so I really arrived here just a day or two before classes began.

00:08:03.395 --> 00:08:05.679
It was really kind of a rushed up deal.

00:08:06.481 --> 00:08:08.986
What was your image of Texas A&M at that point?

00:08:09.006 --> 00:08:10.048
What did you know about it?

00:08:10.549 --> 00:08:11.511
I had never been here.

00:08:12.933 --> 00:08:13.695
Even to visit?

00:08:13.715 --> 00:08:14.116
To visit.

00:08:14.196 --> 00:08:15.258
I'd never been here at all.

00:08:15.458 --> 00:08:16.480
What had you heard about it?

00:08:17.422 --> 00:08:43.142
Well, of course, I was a graduate of Baylor, and we heard about it there, and we had a rivalry, football rivalry, of course, and I was, even though I was from Waco, I did live in the, when I got back from the Army, I did live in the dormitory on Baylor campus, the freshman dormitory in Coconut Hall, and I remember that one night, upperclassmen came into the

00:08:43.763 --> 00:08:52.260
my room, my bedroom, and woke my roommate and me up and said, get dressed.

00:08:52.280 --> 00:08:54.023
We've got to go out and guard for Aggies.

00:08:55.146 --> 00:08:58.853
And that was about the first I'd heard of Aggies.

00:08:59.002 --> 00:09:04.627
other than just knowing about the football rivalry and attending some of the football games.

00:09:04.667 --> 00:09:09.051
Of course, I had lived in Waco and I knew about the Aggie football all along.

00:09:09.071 --> 00:09:16.397
I listened to the games broadcast by Kern Tips all my life and attended a few games at Baylor Stadium.

00:09:17.678 --> 00:09:28.468
And I had classmates that had gone from Waco High to A&M, so I guess I was somewhat informed about it, but I had never been here before.

00:09:28.853 --> 00:09:37.144
When you got back to Austin, you surely must have chatted about this with some of your advisors and faculty friends.

00:09:37.324 --> 00:09:41.149
Did they give you any words about A&M, plus or minus?

00:09:42.030 --> 00:09:44.513
Oh, everybody thought it was a wonderful opportunity.

00:09:45.134 --> 00:09:47.837
I didn't have any negatives about that at all.

00:09:49.419 --> 00:09:52.423
Describe the move over here, you and your family.

00:09:52.563 --> 00:09:53.224
All right.

00:09:53.474 --> 00:10:01.422
Since it was to be a temporary appointment, my family stayed in Austin, and I commuted on weekends to them.

00:10:02.363 --> 00:10:15.535
And then a few months into the school year, I don't really remember how long, but a few months in there, I was offered a regular appointment on tenure.

00:10:15.836 --> 00:10:20.460
Well, we didn't have tenure in those days, really, but it was a regular appointment, not just a...

00:10:20.812 --> 00:10:22.054
Do you remember when that came?

00:10:24.017 --> 00:10:28.083
I think it was during the first semester, maybe toward the end of the first semester, something like that.

00:10:28.464 --> 00:10:31.248
Did, and who, how was that made known to you?

00:10:31.809 --> 00:10:32.890
Conversation or later?

00:10:32.910 --> 00:10:47.933
Oh, that was, yes, that was just in Dr. Parker's office, Grady Parker, he told me about it, about that, and I had kind of hoped that that would happen and kind of, I wasn't too surprised that it happened, although I had made some

00:10:49.820 --> 00:10:54.807
inquiries about other positions and about assistantship at Texas and a few things like that.

00:10:55.408 --> 00:10:57.791
But I really wasn't too real surprised.

00:10:57.831 --> 00:10:59.533
I was hoping that it would work out that way.

00:10:59.654 --> 00:11:05.161
I hadn't been really encouraged that it would, but somehow I thought that might happen.

00:11:05.542 --> 00:11:07.044
Did you move family over here then?

00:11:07.284 --> 00:11:07.524
No.

00:11:08.005 --> 00:11:15.135
Well, we started making plans to do that, and my wife decided that she would stay with our

00:11:15.503 --> 00:11:17.167
home in Austin until it sold.

00:11:18.109 --> 00:11:23.962
And then after a few months, we got tired of that and decided she would move over.

00:11:24.082 --> 00:11:27.068
And the day she moved over, it sold.

00:11:28.151 --> 00:11:29.814
So it sold during that year.

00:11:29.835 --> 00:11:33.242
Describe finding housing for you and family here.

00:11:35.078 --> 00:11:46.997
When I first came over here, thinking it would be temporary, I got a room with Mr. and Mrs. Mays.

00:11:47.197 --> 00:11:58.314
That's spelled M-A-I-S. And the Mays had a grocery store, one of the few grocery stores in town, at the corner of Texas Avenue and University Drive.

00:11:58.374 --> 00:12:00.698
I don't believe they called it University at that time.

00:12:00.678 --> 00:12:06.925
but they had a grocery store there, and they had their home next door to it on Texas, facing Texas Avenue.

00:12:07.715 --> 00:12:09.817
And I rented a room in their home.

00:12:09.937 --> 00:12:11.099
That was my first lodging.

00:12:12.200 --> 00:12:14.302
And I paid $20 a month.

00:12:15.484 --> 00:12:19.568
I got linen changed regularly and had use of the kitchen.

00:12:19.668 --> 00:12:21.590
It was a very good deal.

00:12:21.650 --> 00:12:22.771
I wish I could find that now.

00:12:24.834 --> 00:12:26.315
I wish I could find $20 a day.

00:12:26.355 --> 00:12:27.316
Yes.

00:12:27.337 --> 00:12:31.461
Describe... And then shortly after that,

00:12:31.964 --> 00:12:41.053
I mean, by the time the family came over a few months after that, we rented a home on Carter Creek in the same block where Bill Barzac lived.

00:12:41.073 --> 00:12:48.360
And then we were there about a year, and then we moved to our present home on Tim, just south of the campus, where we still live.

00:12:48.921 --> 00:12:59.992
When you moved into the department, describe getting settled into, where was the department, where was your office, and what was it?

00:13:00.332 --> 00:13:01.093
All right.

00:13:01.934 --> 00:13:11.828
The Department of Education and Psychology, that included the psychology courses and what's now called curriculum instruction and what's now called educational administration, they're all one department.

00:13:12.669 --> 00:13:17.636
And we were on the first floor of the academic building.

00:13:18.878 --> 00:13:26.428
And we were on the, our offices were on the, most all of them were on the south end of the hall.

00:13:26.568 --> 00:13:28.331
And we had both sides of the hall.

00:13:29.012 --> 00:13:30.574
I was on the west side of the hall.

00:13:31.010 --> 00:13:34.013
and there was an ante room there and several offices.

00:13:34.934 --> 00:13:36.897
My office mates were M.S.

00:13:36.937 --> 00:13:46.087
Cavanaugh and Paul Henseling and also George Wilcox.

00:13:46.127 --> 00:13:51.973
Now he had formerly been the head of that department, but was retired, but he still had an office in that suite.

00:13:53.075 --> 00:13:55.778
So I got to be good friends with those men.

00:13:55.938 --> 00:13:57.259
How did they welcome you?

00:13:57.279 --> 00:13:59.802
How did the department receive a newcomer?

00:14:01.587 --> 00:14:02.668
Well, they applauded me.

00:14:02.829 --> 00:14:03.650
That's what they did.

00:14:04.671 --> 00:14:12.481
When I walked in, they clapped their hands, and that was pretty typical of the way they continued to work with me during my first year.

00:14:13.142 --> 00:14:21.853
My primary mentor, the one that helped me the most, was Walter Varvel, because I was in the psychology area mainly.

00:14:21.913 --> 00:14:23.816
Describe that help.

00:14:23.836 --> 00:14:24.216
All right.

00:14:24.577 --> 00:14:27.240
Well, let me first tell about...

00:14:27.625 --> 00:14:30.009
the first day in there with Grady Parker.

00:14:31.110 --> 00:14:40.304
We had some talks and he assigned me my office and I took over the office of Price Ewing who had been teaching test and measurement before he went to Oklahoma State.

00:14:41.205 --> 00:14:50.359
And anyway, after we had finished that visit, Grady Parker took me down the hall to the center area of the academic building, you know, the kind of rotunda

00:14:50.339 --> 00:14:54.053
area and there was a men's restroom there.

00:14:54.073 --> 00:15:01.783
Of course there were only men here anyway, but there was men's, faculty men's restroom it was labeled and it was locked.

00:15:02.253 --> 00:15:05.137
And so he showed it to me, and he issued me a key.

00:15:06.339 --> 00:15:09.984
And I said, Dr. Parker, who are we locking out of here?

00:15:10.745 --> 00:15:13.569
He said, well, women, I guess.

00:15:15.572 --> 00:15:25.506
Or about, you ask about Walter Vorble, he was so kind to me, and of course he knew everything about everything, at least that's what I thought then, and I pretty much still think that.

00:15:26.247 --> 00:15:30.994
He was extremely well read, and apparently remembered everything he ever read.

00:15:30.974 --> 00:15:37.906
He was better than having a reference library.

00:15:37.926 --> 00:15:38.808
I could just ask him.

00:15:40.311 --> 00:15:41.873
So I leaned on him very heavy.

00:15:43.717 --> 00:15:50.569
I had conferences with him before my first classes.

00:15:50.549 --> 00:16:07.424
and he advised me about how to conduct classes, what to expect, how to handle discipline, which wasn't very much to that, but just the details of organizing and conducting a class.

00:16:07.444 --> 00:16:09.286
Was this your first real classroom?

00:16:09.306 --> 00:16:11.728
This was absolutely my first teaching of any kind.

00:16:11.868 --> 00:16:19.695
I had not had any teaching assignments in graduate school, and I had not taught at any previous level, so I was just totally green.

00:16:19.912 --> 00:16:27.524
Did Dr. Warville or any other senior member give you any advice about being a faculty member at Texas A&M?

00:16:28.746 --> 00:16:33.294
Anything, any dos or don'ts?

00:16:33.314 --> 00:16:37.701
Well, I think it was more implied than explicit, you know.

00:16:38.812 --> 00:16:39.713
I would watch them.

00:16:39.733 --> 00:16:40.594
I knew like they did.

00:16:41.596 --> 00:16:43.018
Especially like Vorvel did.

00:16:43.198 --> 00:16:51.749
And I, of course, some of them I looked at them and did the opposite, but not necessarily in that department.

00:16:51.769 --> 00:16:56.295
But no, there was very little orientation actually.

00:16:56.335 --> 00:17:01.202
I don't recall very much in the way of formal orientation at all.

00:17:01.582 --> 00:17:05.107
Nobody told you about smoking or drinking or gambling or anything like that?

00:17:05.347 --> 00:17:06.068
Not a word.

00:17:06.757 --> 00:17:23.495
And I will say, too, that one thing that I appreciated about my work at A&M was that I was given free rein to decide how I would teach my classes and almost free rein about the content.

00:17:23.976 --> 00:17:27.099
Of course, I did discuss the content with other faculty members.

00:17:27.159 --> 00:17:32.545
And if I was teaching a course that was taught by other faculty members, too, I would coordinate it with them.

00:17:32.930 --> 00:17:44.188
But I was really surprised, and still am surprised in a way, how much freedom I did have to plan and conduct and do my teaching.

00:17:44.228 --> 00:17:51.620
They seemed to trust my knowledge of my subjects and my ability to teach it, even from the beginning.

00:17:52.641 --> 00:17:56.027
And that was true throughout my stay at A&M.

00:17:56.467 --> 00:18:00.574
Now, by and large, those colleagues

00:18:01.195 --> 00:18:03.619
present on campus from what hour to what hour.

00:18:04.500 --> 00:18:06.824
OK. And by the way, we didn't have many.

00:18:06.924 --> 00:18:08.346
That was a very small department.

00:18:09.107 --> 00:18:13.795
A&M was not into teacher education at that time to a very great extent at all.

00:18:14.536 --> 00:18:19.844
They were into training some school administrators, principals, and some school counselors.

00:18:20.666 --> 00:18:25.954
And they did train some secondary teachers, high school.

00:18:26.153 --> 00:18:29.579
and no elementary education program.

00:18:30.441 --> 00:18:36.672
And we did teach all of the psychology courses, but the enrollment then was only about, was it about 6,000?

00:18:36.692 --> 00:18:38.816
Does that sound right to you?

00:18:38.876 --> 00:18:40.039
Between 6 and 7,000.

00:18:41.201 --> 00:18:43.184
So we didn't have a large faculty.

00:18:43.204 --> 00:18:45.308
I think there were about six on our whole faculty.

00:18:46.571 --> 00:18:48.955
And you asked about the hours.

00:18:50.605 --> 00:18:57.835
At that time, they were there almost all day, every day, and we also had night classes.

00:18:57.915 --> 00:19:08.530
All the time that I was at A&M in my department, we had night classes, and there was hardly a semester the entire 34 years that I didn't have at least

00:19:08.510 --> 00:19:13.558
one night class that met usually from five to eight, occasionally from six to nine.

00:19:13.618 --> 00:19:19.448
In the summer, we didn't have night classes, with a few exceptions.

00:19:19.688 --> 00:19:22.232
In those early years, was there a coffee pot nearby?

00:19:22.252 --> 00:19:27.200
Or did you all go to the MSC for coffee?

00:19:30.085 --> 00:19:34.973
Right at that first time, those first year or two,

00:19:35.543 --> 00:19:39.225
I remember going to the MSC a lot with Warble and with Kavanaugh.

00:19:39.678 --> 00:19:42.120
and Hensling sometime, Grady Parker.

00:19:43.121 --> 00:19:52.331
And some other colleagues that I didn't see quite as often because they were in a different house and a different place were Austin Curley and Doug Perry.

00:19:52.451 --> 00:19:55.133
They were in what they call the basic division.

00:19:56.415 --> 00:19:58.817
But of course, I saw them pretty often too.

00:19:58.877 --> 00:20:01.560
But those I mentioned were the ones I saw.

00:20:02.080 --> 00:20:03.361
And I remember going to the MSC.

00:20:03.441 --> 00:20:09.027
I don't know whether that was because we didn't have a coffee pot or whether we just preferred to go over there, but I remember that.

00:20:09.327 --> 00:20:19.807
Later we moved to the fourth floor of the academic building and at that time we had a very active interaction with other faculty members for coffee.

00:20:20.548 --> 00:20:27.201
We had a room on the fourth floor right off the lobby that we shared with the English department mainly.

00:20:27.704 --> 00:20:31.611
And by that time, our department had grown quite a bit.

00:20:32.714 --> 00:20:36.601
And sometimes philosophy would be in there.

00:20:37.162 --> 00:20:38.445
You might have even been in there.

00:20:38.485 --> 00:20:38.765
Were you?

00:20:38.845 --> 00:20:39.226
I don't know.

00:20:39.587 --> 00:20:41.050
I don't remember you being in there much.

00:20:41.150 --> 00:20:46.540
But you were probably over at the library doing research while we were drinking that coffee.

00:20:47.144 --> 00:20:49.969
But we did have some very good times.

00:20:50.490 --> 00:20:55.038
In that first year, did you have a private office or did you share it with a colleague?

00:20:55.218 --> 00:20:56.320
I had a private office.

00:20:56.901 --> 00:20:59.084
Oh, that is good.

00:20:59.365 --> 00:21:04.073
Was it normal when you began, was it normal to post office hours?

00:21:05.656 --> 00:21:10.101
No, they just figured you'd be there if it was business hours, we'd be there.

00:21:10.321 --> 00:21:11.722
That's what I thought.

00:21:11.742 --> 00:21:13.124
This is an editorial note.

00:21:14.145 --> 00:21:17.268
Frank Hubert began his... Later, of course, we did.

00:21:17.548 --> 00:21:18.830
Oh, yeah.

00:21:18.850 --> 00:21:23.274
Frank Hubert began his service as dean in the summer of 1959.

00:21:24.235 --> 00:21:33.385
I've learned from doing these interviews that President Earl Rutter then knew in his chief executive office job here on the campus

00:21:33.854 --> 00:21:47.769
had been inquiring around Texas for someone who would have very good contact with the public high schools in the state, and Frank Hubert had been recommended to him as such a person.

00:21:48.690 --> 00:22:03.726
Then I understand that after Dean Hubert got here, he and President Rutter and Vice President Wayne Hall agreed that what was then the School of Arts and Sciences would get extra attention

00:22:03.773 --> 00:22:11.097
particularly in education and in business, which were then nothing more than departments.

00:22:12.020 --> 00:22:17.277
And that the dream was that those areas would grow

00:22:18.033 --> 00:22:20.796
and make a great deal of progress.

00:22:21.397 --> 00:22:31.908
And so this fall of 1959 was the beginning of that DREAMS implementation.

00:22:34.150 --> 00:22:36.753
Did- That was also about the time Paul Hensley came.

00:22:36.793 --> 00:22:38.254
He may have come the year before I did.

00:22:38.274 --> 00:22:43.720
As you met your first classes, describe,

00:22:43.970 --> 00:22:51.892
your impression of Aggie students, and what was it like to be a new teacher, and particularly to be a new faculty member in the classroom here?

00:22:53.356 --> 00:22:58.350
Well, I was a little nervous at first, but I was really

00:22:58.870 --> 00:23:02.616
I loved it from the very beginning, just from the very beginning.

00:23:03.197 --> 00:23:05.140
I felt like this was what I was intended to do.

00:23:05.160 --> 00:23:13.133
I hadn't done it before, but I immediately got the impression that this was for me, what I really wanted to continue doing.

00:23:14.095 --> 00:23:18.482
And I spent a whole lot of time in preparation.

00:23:18.462 --> 00:23:24.471
even more than was necessary later, of course, since everything was new.

00:23:24.531 --> 00:23:40.213
One thing I was very grateful for that throughout my time at A&M, I was almost always given a chance to teach the courses that I preferred to teach.

00:23:41.655 --> 00:23:44.219
That was partly because I was hired for that purpose, you know.

00:23:44.379 --> 00:23:45.060
I guess I was

00:23:45.732 --> 00:23:47.835
always the best qualified one for those.

00:23:48.876 --> 00:24:01.933
But there was hardly any time that I had to teach courses that I wasn't well prepared by education, at least, to teach, and by some of the work that I'd done, too, because I'd been employed in testing.

00:24:02.875 --> 00:24:06.579
And I forgot just what you were.

00:24:06.920 --> 00:24:13.849
When you go to these first classes, at what level were they, and what were the students like?

00:24:15.280 --> 00:24:24.784
Well, we had two survey courses in introductory psychology, 207 and 303.

00:24:25.979 --> 00:24:29.584
And I asked Cavanaugh, my neighbor, what's the difference?

00:24:29.604 --> 00:24:34.211
He said, well, in 207, we use Munn as a text and lecture out of Hilgard.

00:24:34.731 --> 00:24:38.476
And in 303, we use Hilgard as a text and lecture out of Munn.

00:24:39.638 --> 00:24:41.340
That's exactly the answer he gave me.

00:24:41.661 --> 00:24:45.206
And they were nearly the same course.

00:24:45.246 --> 00:24:47.930
But 303 was intended for technical students.

00:24:47.950 --> 00:24:50.333
We had the engineering and business students in there.

00:24:50.313 --> 00:25:02.899
And we had everybody else in 207, the liberal arts students, although there weren't very many of them, but we had just everybody that weren't, except engineering and business, we had in the 207.

00:25:03.861 --> 00:25:09.352
And we typically had classes of around 50 in a survey course like that.

00:25:09.573 --> 00:25:11.697
So these were juniors and seniors?

00:25:12.082 --> 00:25:14.966
I mean, excuse me, sophomore and junior, two and three hundred.

00:25:15.306 --> 00:25:15.607
Yes.

00:25:16.288 --> 00:25:21.575
And very few majors in education or psychology, is that right?

00:25:21.595 --> 00:25:23.838
We had no major in psychology at that time.

00:25:24.719 --> 00:25:33.351
And, yeah, well, if they were, 207 would have those that major in education, but that was a very small number.

00:25:34.332 --> 00:25:40.941
And both class, and they were, although they were sophomore and junior,

00:25:41.225 --> 00:25:53.347
It wasn't unusual for a senior to be in either one, or not too unusual for a freshman even, but all underclassmen.

00:25:53.667 --> 00:25:57.575
But primarily they were juniors and sophomores.

00:25:58.516 --> 00:26:03.385
And we met.

00:26:03.584 --> 00:26:11.193
Well, I've met classes in every building nearly on this campus, but I guess in those days we met most all of them in the academic building.

00:26:11.553 --> 00:26:12.594
Very convenient.

00:26:12.614 --> 00:26:12.855
All right.

00:26:12.875 --> 00:26:17.260
You had seen Baylor students and UT students.

00:26:17.960 --> 00:26:22.826
What impression did those Aggie students make in those first, that first semester?

00:26:24.187 --> 00:26:29.153
I was favorably impressed, very favorably impressed, and continue to be.

00:26:29.588 --> 00:26:30.969
all through the time I was here.

00:26:31.310 --> 00:26:36.014
Did they at all tease you about being a Baylor or a Longhorn?

00:26:36.415 --> 00:26:37.636
Oh, I heard a little of that.

00:26:37.756 --> 00:26:42.520
Yeah, just a little of that from the faculty and students, too.

00:26:42.620 --> 00:26:45.884
But you know, it never amounted to very much.

00:26:47.765 --> 00:26:54.332
The students were, at first, they were all men, naturally.

00:26:54.432 --> 00:26:58.836
And also, they were mostly in uniform.

00:27:00.200 --> 00:27:03.344
even the upperclassmen a lot up wearing uniform, you know.

00:27:03.845 --> 00:27:06.509
Did they come, was their attendance regular?

00:27:07.169 --> 00:27:07.410
Yes.

00:27:08.291 --> 00:27:11.215
I didn't have much trouble with absences in those early days.

00:27:12.016 --> 00:27:12.477
And they were?

00:27:12.497 --> 00:27:13.498
Maybe a little more later.

00:27:13.798 --> 00:27:15.601
They were appropriately respectful?

00:27:16.482 --> 00:27:16.903
They were.

00:27:17.203 --> 00:27:17.904
Yeah, I was surprised.

00:27:17.924 --> 00:27:25.394
And I was only about thirty years old myself, you know, not much older than some of them, but they were, they were respectful, yes they were.

00:27:25.775 --> 00:27:29.700
Did anybody come up to try to make a special impression?

00:27:30.136 --> 00:27:34.689
and to introduce themselves or come by so you'd be sure to know who they were?

00:27:34.729 --> 00:27:40.045
You know, I got the impression they were deliberately not doing that.

00:27:41.088 --> 00:27:43.770
I also never received gifts from students.

00:27:44.631 --> 00:27:50.896
Occasionally, later on, I did occasionally get gifts from, small gifts from some foreign students.

00:27:50.936 --> 00:27:53.038
And I was always a little ambiguous about that.

00:27:53.539 --> 00:27:57.041
You know, I thought it would be rude not to accept it.

00:27:57.062 --> 00:28:00.104
And didn't know, didn't quite want to accept it either.

00:28:00.144 --> 00:28:05.148
But I did receive a few, you know, souvenir kind of things from foreign students.

00:28:05.188 --> 00:28:10.673
But I never received gifts from students or never

00:28:11.075 --> 00:28:12.657
thought anybody was bribing.

00:28:13.699 --> 00:28:14.760
That just never did come up.

00:28:15.161 --> 00:28:24.053
In those early semesters, do you remember any event that caused you to turn to somebody for advice and, hey, this happened, what do I do about this or that?

00:28:27.077 --> 00:28:35.428
Well, I think you're probably talking about conduct primarily, but as far as content is concerned, you know,

00:28:35.965 --> 00:28:41.653
how would be a good way to approach this subject or introduce this subject, you know.

00:28:41.673 --> 00:28:43.435
I went to barbel with that.

00:28:44.577 --> 00:28:54.690
And as far as conduct was concerned, it was remarkable how little problem I did have with that.

00:28:55.571 --> 00:29:02.901
I don't believe much of that was due to me because I was green, you know, I didn't know what I was doing.

00:29:03.269 --> 00:29:05.833
But like you asked if they were respectful, they were.

00:29:05.873 --> 00:29:07.355
They did what I told them to.

00:29:09.558 --> 00:29:11.942
They seemed interested, you know.

00:29:12.062 --> 00:29:16.829
I tried to, my main way of getting discipline is try to make the class interesting.

00:29:17.009 --> 00:29:19.112
That was always my strategy.

00:29:20.134 --> 00:29:25.682
And if someday I just couldn't really get quite up

00:29:25.662 --> 00:29:27.644
for a subject that day.

00:29:28.465 --> 00:29:32.169
Well, I went into some very closely related subject that I could get up for.

00:29:32.189 --> 00:29:35.572
I felt it that important to maintain their interest.

00:29:36.253 --> 00:29:54.572
And I always, especially at the beginning of the class, but all throughout the class, I tried to give a lively presentation, and I told some jokes, and not really so much jokes as just kind of having a light touch, you know, not being too serious about the subject.

00:29:55.750 --> 00:30:05.863
And I remember a few problems that I had or thought I was having with cheating.

00:30:06.605 --> 00:30:07.127
Not many.

00:30:07.546 --> 00:30:10.709
In fact, I'm really surprised I've had so little experience with that.

00:30:11.210 --> 00:30:13.172
Of course, there's probably some I didn't know about.

00:30:13.913 --> 00:30:22.642
But there were a few times, and I would talk to horrible William about that, or maybe Grady Parker, and there were a few times I was sure of it.

00:30:23.724 --> 00:30:32.473
And I remember one time I had a, perhaps on their advice, I gave,

00:30:32.723 --> 00:30:39.253
different questions on the same test and alternated them, but didn't make a big deal about who was getting which test.

00:30:39.594 --> 00:30:40.455
They looked the same.

00:30:41.276 --> 00:30:46.684
And occasionally I would get answers to the, correct answers to the wrong question.

00:30:48.808 --> 00:30:51.071
And I would confront them about that.

00:30:52.473 --> 00:30:58.883
If it only happened once, and it never did happen more than once, I didn't report them to...

00:30:58.863 --> 00:31:03.254
We didn't have a committee in those days for that, and I didn't carry it any further.

00:31:03.314 --> 00:31:04.477
I just straightened it out between.

00:31:04.518 --> 00:31:11.175
Did any student attempt to give you a memorable excuse for the cheating?

00:31:14.924 --> 00:31:15.606
No.
