WEBVTT

00:10.392 --> 00:11.273
Okay. Of course, at this time, the Army's 
advancement did basically depend on how many

00:13.174 --> 00:21.302
people were in rank at the time. And if someone did 
die, then it was time for somebody else to move up

00:21.362 --> 00:26.286
because it was so frozen. It was almost strictly 
seniority. Yeah. To further point that out, in

00:30.249 --> 00:40.078
1940, when I went on active duty and joined the 7th 
Division, Excuse me, Sixth Division. In those

00:44.191 --> 00:46.213
days, we had Square Division. We had an artillery 
regiment.

00:51.037 --> 00:53.399
I was attached to a battery.

00:57.503 --> 00:59.704
The battery commander was Captain Eaps. Mind you 
now, this was 1940. He was class of 27 at West Point.

01:10.298 --> 01:20.472
Battery exec, First Lieutenant William O. Darby, 
who later became the name of the Darby's Rangers,

01:10.298 --> 01:20.472
the class of 1934. But they were caught in the 
appropriations. Our regimental commander, one

01:26.160 --> 01:34.912
of the toughest guys you ever saw, and the job 
called for a full colonel. It was a major turn.

01:38.977 --> 01:39.478
I'll give you some ideas.

01:43.019 --> 01:49.248
What did you think of the professional soldiers 
that were at A&M at the time? As a whole, I liked

01:49.268 --> 01:50.450
them. We had a few of them. I'm particularly fond of 
Lieutenant Jeff Vins, who was not only an

01:54.416 --> 02:10.399
excellent instructor, but he had a sense of humor. 
One day he gave a true and false test. And I marked it

02:13.495 --> 02:19.462
true and put in parentheses flip coin. And he 
marked it x by and put in parentheses wrong side.

02:27.731 --> 02:33.958
But we had equitation, and

02:27.731 --> 02:33.958
I enjoyed that. In fact, our equitation 
instructor had a, well, his wife, the mayor, And it

02:42.841 --> 02:47.086
was a beautiful horse. And I happened to have a 
rather good seat on the horse. Among other things,

02:52.592 --> 03:02.804
when I was in high school, we had a Calvary 
lieutenant who used to have equitation classes on

02:52.592 --> 03:02.804
Saturdays. And I took that. But this horse, when he 
jumped, He'd stumble in the jumps. And it took me

03:15.010 --> 03:23.519
three or four times riding him to find out what the 
problem was. Normally, I don't know if you're

03:23.539 --> 03:30.126
familiar with horses or not, but horses have a 
right lead. And you take them on the right and they

03:30.487 --> 03:36.493
jump, and their right foot is ahead and they jump. 
This horse happened to have a left lead. And when

03:39.490 --> 03:46.961
you went in from the right, the mayor changed and 
threw her off. And I just go, you take her in from the

03:48.283 --> 03:53.270
left, where she was on the left lead.

03:55.834 --> 04:00.540
And

03:55.834 --> 04:00.540
I jibbed her down. But we had an excellent stable of 
horses. Most of them were just army remasters. And

04:07.570 --> 04:17.181
we'd be on them, and the instructor would say, 
they'd be in a circle, and he'd say, by the left

04:07.570 --> 04:17.181
flank, you can see those ears wiggle like that. Oh, 
and they'd almost go by themselves. But we jumped

04:21.065 --> 04:22.607
them through jumps. We jumped through them 
blindfolded and took jackets

04:22.647 --> 04:28.614
off. Here we go. Did the professional officers, 
did they seem a little... I'm

04:35.836 --> 04:50.455
not sure

04:35.836 --> 04:50.455
in those days.

04:54.540 --> 05:02.711
Since World War II, ROTC duty has been part of their 
career advancement. I'm not certain in those

05:02.731 --> 05:04.493
days. In many instances, the commandant, who was 
chief of PMS&E,

05:04.861 --> 05:25.151
was probably on his last assignment in Norman's 
book. He was probably on his last assignment, and I

05:25.171 --> 05:30.919
don't think that is too far from true now.

05:36.029 --> 05:38.952
But we had some characters. Yet they were very 
cooperative in many ways.

05:45.637 --> 06:01.171
One year, we had an individual in there that 
obviously had one foot short of the other.

06:01.191 --> 06:05.935
And he'd march in ranks, you know, and so forth. 
began to get a little suspicious, I think I was a

06:07.552 --> 06:14.402
junior.

06:14.422 --> 06:23.735
So we kept questioning him about, you know, what 
classes he would take and where his money came

06:14.422 --> 06:23.735
from. He said he'd been disabled in the state after 
the state

06:23.755 --> 06:29.783
was banned. So finally we went down to the 
commandant's office and he was just He wasn't even

06:33.927 --> 06:35.189
registered. He was just having a brief room tour. 
So I went over to the commandant's office, knocked

06:39.758 --> 06:49.036
on the door, asking if he wanted to take care of it, 
if he wanted us to take care of it. He said he'd be

06:49.056 --> 06:51.861
happy if we took care of it. So we just very quietly 
went back and told him that when the daylight came,

06:51.881 --> 06:56.610
he better be gone.

07:04.353 --> 07:13.421
But our tactical officers, for the most part,

07:04.353 --> 07:13.421
were able, dedicated people. Not all of them. 
Would you compare the quality of A&M grads with

07:15.083 --> 07:23.931
other ROTC graduates at other schools?

07:27.354 --> 07:31.558
As a group, and I'm talking about myself,

07:34.390 --> 07:44.545
group, they were heads and shoulders above all 
other ROPC officers. As far as preparation,

07:44.565 --> 07:56.603
how about would you compare them with West Point 
grads?

07:56.623 --> 08:01.731
On initial appointment as second lieutenant, 
they were ahead of West Point grads. But you must

08:03.820 --> 08:23.068
remember that a West Point graduate's

08:03.820 --> 08:23.068
primary instruction

08:03.820 --> 08:23.068
was duty, honor, country, and an engineering

08:03.820 --> 08:23.068
degree. The Army's system was, and it took me a 
number of years to grasp this, but I did.

08:34.567 --> 08:39.614
The education produced the basic officer. We felt 
like we knew more than West Point graduates, which

08:39.634 --> 08:51.170
we did because of our hands-on training

08:39.634 --> 08:51.170
at the college. But the Army's theory then, and it 
is now, that we can teach you that in basic brain

08:57.871 --> 09:10.542
schools and advanced brain schools and progress, 
and I have no quarrel with

08:57.871 --> 09:10.542
it. So I have very great respect for all of the 
service academies. They turn out some

09:16.388 --> 09:27.658
poor people as do other institutions, but as a 
whole, I heard from some people that as far as

09:28.803 --> 09:39.097
promotion is concerned, there's sort of a West 
Point club. We used to refer to it as WPPA, West

09:39.117 --> 09:46.648
Point Protective Association. Do you think there 
is such a thing?

09:52.957 --> 09:56.582
Not so much up to Lieutenant Colonel.

09:59.262 --> 10:03.086
up to including lieutenant colonel. Beyond that,

10:03.106 --> 10:08.853
there are fewer colonels. If you look at the 
division, for example, there's approximately 26

10:08.953 --> 10:21.908
lieutenant colonels,

10:08.953 --> 10:21.908
six full colonels, and three general officers. 
The competition gets rough.

10:26.213 --> 10:27.615
And I have seen it work. Even when I was overseas, 
when the Army called me, when I was at the Corps

10:29.182 --> 10:38.834
headquarters, said, I've got a major so-and-so 
coming down to Vegas. He said, he's a member of the

10:38.854 --> 10:41.838
WPPA, but he's a nice guy.

10:44.702 --> 10:56.277
But when

10:44.702 --> 10:56.277
you get up to a colonel in general, then you're in 
direct competition

10:44.702 --> 10:56.277
with him. I don't think that that applies... quite 
as strong in the regular

11:00.265 --> 11:10.315
army. So you think it's more a question of quality 
and the competition? I think so. There's still a

11:16.301 --> 11:22.928
little element of it that can't help but be an old 
school tie. Yeah. Is there a Texas A&M Protective

11:25.070 --> 11:28.213
Association? Not that I know of, but they 
immediately recognized

11:28.801 --> 11:36.792
each other. But one thing about the West Point 
graduate, particularly depending upon his

11:36.812 --> 11:57.981
ability and his course of action, one of the finest 
jobs that you could possibly have is a young

11:36.812 --> 11:57.981
lieutenant as an aide to a general officer.

12:01.370 --> 12:03.973
They seem to get those jobs. Is that what you're 
saying? You get to know a lot of people. Sometimes

12:09.679 --> 12:15.085
if you really get in a sticky situation, you can 
maybe call for some help from somebody that knows

12:09.679 --> 12:15.085
you. You're not just a face. But the Army has a 
rather rigid society, as does the university.

12:29.956 --> 12:37.165
For example, an assistant professor's wife 
wouldn't dare call the dean's wife by her first

12:29.956 --> 12:37.165
name. The military works the same way, and I think 
it's necessary. But I have no quarrel with service

12:41.631 --> 12:46.317
captains. But I have found that Texas A&M 
University graduates

12:46.337 --> 12:55.930
make fine officers, not in every case. When

12:56.703 --> 13:05.151
you graduated from A&M, did you know what you 
wanted to do? Yes, sir. What was that that you

13:06.632 --> 13:09.375
wanted to do? Have you ever heard of the Thomason 
Act? Yeah, I have heard of the Thomason Act. Do you

13:14.039 --> 13:15.521
know any background on it? Yeah.

13:21.446 --> 13:25.410
Did you want to become a regular officer under the 
Thomason Act? The Thomason Act,

13:25.812 --> 13:43.190
if I may divert, there was a congressman named 
Ewing Thomason who later became a federal

13:25.812 --> 13:43.190
district judge in El Paso. His son, Bill Thomason, 
lives in Bryan. He's retired now. He's an

13:50.057 --> 13:52.180
attorney. But he owned the John Deere business for 
many years. But he introduced a bill in Congress

13:56.322 --> 14:09.297
called, we refer to it as the Tonkin Act, in which 
case 1,000 reserve officers would be put on active

13:56.322 --> 14:09.297
duty for a year. At the end of that time, 50 of them 
would be

14:09.317 --> 14:17.888
chosen for regular commissions. I applied for 
that. You're a senior here at A&M? Yes. My chief of

14:23.795 --> 14:25.857
section taught me how to do it.

14:30.950 --> 14:35.295
I'm not certain Fireside was different, though. 
And I'm sure he felt like he may have been just in a

14:36.776 --> 14:45.126
down period there, or his career wasn't going real 
well. But I turned it down. And then the next year, I

14:49.791 --> 14:51.573
reapplied. And

14:51.693 --> 14:58.881
believe it or not, I didn't pass the physical.

15:02.759 --> 15:07.786
due to an unfortunate set of circumstances.

15:07.806 --> 15:20.584
I was living in Fort Worth, and I drove up Fort Sill, 
Oklahoma, and got the doctor off the golf course.

15:20.604 --> 15:31.399
And he reported me as unstable blood pressure, 
which doesn't mean anything, and pigmented nevi,

15:20.604 --> 15:31.399
which is...

15:34.450 --> 15:40.035
some of these spots

15:34.450 --> 15:40.035
here. Of course, they had a lot of people to select 
from. I went down to Fort Sam Houston, Texas. This

15:46.221 --> 15:54.489
colonel in charge right away let me know that Major 
Brown was a competent doctor. And I said, sir, I

15:54.509 --> 15:57.532
didn't come down here to run Major Brown down. I 
came down to try to get in the Army. So they ended up

16:01.736 --> 16:03.057
with me laying naked on a table, my arm plunged in 
ice water to here, taking the blood pressure.

16:15.917 --> 16:19.061
And then they discussed this multiple pigmented 
nevi. And I could hear one say, well, Jack will be

16:20.983 --> 16:23.506
here in a minute. We'll see what he says, who I 
assume was a dermatologist. So this officer

16:28.672 --> 16:34.900
strolls in with a white jacket on, looks at one 
here. Walked all the way around, got to the door,

16:35.639 --> 16:40.986
and turned around and said, not a damn thing. But 
they couldn't

16:41.007 --> 16:50.039
get over it. Unstable blood pressure. Was it true? 
I mean, every time they take your blood pressure,

16:52.222 --> 16:59.973
was

16:52.222 --> 16:59.973
it different? Apparently so. So they wouldn't let 
you in? They had a number of options for them. So

17:05.339 --> 17:06.861
what did you decide to do? Find a job. See, when I got 
here, I went to work for Oliver Farm Equipment

17:11.888 --> 17:25.388
Company in the Dallas range. The jobs weren't 
easy. No, no. What were you doing?

17:36.389 --> 17:37.891
A little bit of everything. I was

17:38.051 --> 17:54.409
trying to design a system of making the plow go up 
and down

17:38.051 --> 17:54.409
automatically on the tractor.

17:54.429 --> 18:01.317
The art of hydraulics needed World War II to bring 
it along.

18:04.250 --> 18:07.513
The guy that had been working on it was doing it in 
the spring. I could never

18:07.533 --> 18:11.778
prove it. I finally ended up, I guess you'd say, in 
the accounting department. But to show you how

18:19.005 --> 18:24.590
tough times were, I went to work $85 a month. And 
that 30 days cut everybody in the branch

18:24.610 --> 18:32.158
10%. And after a year,

18:37.932 --> 18:38.833
I left them. I had worked over in Fort Worth in one of 
the farm stokers.

18:44.859 --> 18:59.213
After a year, I left them and came back down here and 
went to the department head and interviewed and

18:44.859 --> 18:59.213
went to work with Wallace Black in Dallas.

19:02.877 --> 19:04.378
And I stayed with them until That was 37. They were 
in 1940. So you went active. No, you went active in

19:10.144 --> 19:11.425
1941. Well, I went active in 1941. I went on active 
duty in 1940. But, see, I loved the engineering

19:18.534 --> 19:20.757
department. I was up there about nine months. At 
that time, they had a program, which they had

19:23.941 --> 19:27.666
stopped. of taking engineers and sending them to 
Oil City, Pennsylvania for a year to go through the

19:29.198 --> 19:37.987
various departments where they're 
manufactured. They had moved their main office to

19:38.007 --> 19:44.213
Dallas a few years before that. Oil Supply Company 
is a wholly owned subsidiary of U.S. Steel, or was.

19:51.120 --> 19:55.445
I enjoyed the engineering drafting department. 
Our chief engineer, Gus Meyer, and our chief

19:58.544 --> 20:13.229
craftsman, Hans Vogelgesang, were both born, 
raised, and university educated in Germany.

20:13.249 --> 20:20.401
Hans and I became rather close friends, and I loved 
working there. Then they sent me to the field as a

20:20.421 --> 20:24.147
service

20:27.637 --> 20:30.862
And that's where I met my wife. I was stationed in 
Graham, Texas. And I went through the, I guess,

20:34.347 --> 20:41.738
West Wichita Hall, what they call the KMA. And

20:42.379 --> 20:48.968
then they transferred me to Illinois. And that was 
pure hell. Why?

20:55.999 --> 20:56.800
It was another book. We were living in southern 
Illinois.

21:02.410 --> 21:09.837
The winters were bitter and the summers were 
terribly hot.

21:09.857 --> 21:12.580
I've been stuck six and seven times in one day. I 
started at, oh well, $100 a month, which wasn't too

21:15.122 --> 21:20.907
bad. When I went to Field and Graham, I got all the 
way up to $115 a month. When I transferred to

21:33.558 --> 21:36.743
Illinois, I was making $135 a month.

21:43.252 --> 21:50.623
The conditions were terrible,

21:43.252 --> 21:50.623
and the pay was poor. I was living in a boon town. I 
was paying $35 a month rent. And living conditions

21:55.657 --> 22:01.527
were poor, and I was married and everything else. 
So finally, in 1940, I just went in to the district

22:01.547 --> 22:06.334
manager. I made a noise and told him. I was getting a 
30-day notice. And he immediately said, you're

22:13.907 --> 22:20.958
going to work with another supply company. 
Because they had a little deed. If I had quit them

22:24.547 --> 22:34.917
and gone to work for, say, Republic Supply 
Company, all they had to do is pick up the phone and

22:24.547 --> 22:34.917
tell them, call them, and say, hey, the whole 
hostel left us to go to work for you. And they'd say,

22:34.937 --> 22:35.898
that's enough. We'll take care of

22:35.918 --> 22:40.122
it. I told them no. I was going back to Texas. Went by 
Fort Worth, the former store man in Wichita Falls,

22:43.825 --> 22:54.435
where we were doing a quarter million dollars a 
month, big money in those days. the district

22:55.124 --> 22:58.108
manager. And he said, go on over to Dallas and tell 
them you want to go to work at the bottom hole

22:58.128 --> 23:05.860
department. I said, I don't know anything about 
bottom hole work. He said, I'll teach you all you

23:07.963 --> 23:11.748
need to know. I said, no. I said, as far as I'm 
concerned, they're a bunch of so-and-sos, and I'm

23:12.750 --> 23:19.860
going to take them. I came back here and went, no. So 
did you work for your uncle now? No.

23:33.852 --> 23:34.813
A man by the name of O.B. Donahue had worked for my 
father now. He started to use carpenters. And a few

23:42.583 --> 23:50.313
months later, Jutte came by

23:42.583 --> 23:50.313
and wanted to meet Jutte. But

23:54.625 --> 24:05.236
An interesting thing, when I moved to Illinois, I 
transferred my reserve affiliation from San

23:54.625 --> 24:05.236
Antonio to St. Louis.

24:09.260 --> 24:11.503
All the time it was just paper outfit. Even when I 
was in Texas, I would take the paper outfit. So you

24:14.406 --> 24:18.990
never did any training from 1936 until 1940, 
really? Extremely enough, I did.

24:23.920 --> 24:32.571
Where I lived in Salem, Illinois, they had an 
infantry company of the 33rd Illinois National

24:23.920 --> 24:32.571
Guard. I went out to see the company commander, and 
he said he didn't need any officers. So I said, it

24:37.997 --> 24:45.927
would be all right if I just take my insignia off and 
just show up and drill with you. He said, yeah, I'll

24:45.947 --> 24:46.688
be fine. So they'd issue me a rifle, you know. We'd 
be at formation, port on. They'd call somebody

24:52.963 --> 24:56.826
else's name, and I'd put my rifle down. I drove in, 
no pay, no recognition.

25:01.931 --> 25:04.893
Why'd you decide to do that? Keep my hand in

25:05.614 --> 25:11.439
there. In 1940, you went active for a couple of 
weeks. Oh, 30 days. The reason I did that, number

25:15.710 --> 25:27.447
one, was in order to get promoted to first 
lieutenant. I was ordered to Camp Jackson, South

25:27.467 --> 25:32.956
Carolina, and I was attached to the 6th Division. 
And we stayed there a week, a week and a half, and we

25:35.279 --> 25:42.730
moved to Fort Benning, Georgia. What I wasn't 
aware of, I was the second lieutenant, was that

25:43.992 --> 25:58.488
this was the pre-1940 Louisiana

25:43.992 --> 25:58.488
maneuvers. And we marched around in the red clay of 
Georgia in the rain. And some interesting

26:05.456 --> 26:08.920
highlights occurred. The 1940

26:09.676 --> 26:39.008
maneuvers, as far as I've ever been able to find 
out, were a fiasco in Louisiana that somehow both

26:09.676 --> 26:39.008
forces decided they were opposing overwhelming 
forces.

26:41.907 --> 26:50.160
And as a result, they pulled so far back that they 
called it off. But

26:50.180 --> 26:56.970
we had a bunch of old regular army people there. One 
of the things that I always enjoyed was a

26:56.990 --> 27:05.083
regimental commander.

27:05.103 --> 27:06.665
All of his messengers were out. His flags were 
misplaced. His telephone lines were cut, and he

27:11.675 --> 27:19.062
had an old hand-winding radio. He radioed 
division headquarters and completely out of

27:19.082 --> 27:31.634
communication.

27:31.654 --> 27:37.359
So when I played that tour duty, I came from behind. 
How did the older actor officers get along with a

27:40.463 --> 27:45.571
30-day officer? Is there any friction? Not 
really.

27:54.486 --> 28:00.215
They tolerate this, I'm sure, because we knew 
little or nothing. At that particular time in

28:00.235 --> 28:04.362
Battery C,

28:12.205 --> 28:26.284
We had, in addition to two or three of us, we had an 
even dozen pilots attached to us. Randolph Field

28:26.304 --> 28:35.396
was in the air academy where all the pilot training 
took place. And somebody got the brilliant idea,

28:37.138 --> 28:41.284
as they were wanting to do, that in order for a pilot 
to support the ground troops, he needs to know how

28:42.361 --> 28:50.830
they lead. So that graduating class, and it was one 
that somebody got married every 30 minutes to the

28:50.850 --> 28:58.419
chapel. So they attached them to these various 
units that were going to be in Louisiana. I might

29:05.206 --> 29:11.693
add as an aside, they hated every

29:05.206 --> 29:11.693
penny done. We had a large battery mess there. But

29:18.352 --> 29:26.619
Captain Eaps and Lieutenant Darby were very 
tolerant of us. They didn't pay much attention to

29:26.639 --> 29:32.424
us because they had so many other things to share. 
But I was made a forward observer, which I hadn't

29:32.444 --> 29:40.812
the faintest idea what a forward observer did. I 
learned a lot from the sergeants. which you can if

29:44.377 --> 29:47.800
you listen to them. And I completed that Thursday 
tour of Goodyear. And then you were promoted after

29:51.343 --> 29:57.249
that to first lieutenant.

29:57.269 --> 30:01.693
Did you want to, at that point, did you want to stay 
in the service? Did you want to come back in your

30:01.713 --> 30:04.115
automobile? I meant to tell you something. I'm not 
sure what I wanted to do then. In 1940, I was knocked

30:11.422 --> 30:13.624
down. really aware of the international 
situation.

30:22.927 --> 30:27.692
I've often wondered had I acted on it at the 
foresight. But St. Louis Reserve Headquarters

30:29.754 --> 30:42.767
started sending me letters about once every 30 
days requesting that I transfer to the Army Air and

30:44.738 --> 30:55.050
go on immediate active duty as a plant inspector,

30:44.738 --> 30:55.050
had I been aware of what the circumstances were. 
See, they were getting called to guard, but I

30:55.070 --> 30:58.654
wasn't aware of that. I was in rather an isolated 
world.

31:05.962 --> 31:09.286
I probably would have taken it. Where it had led, I 
don't know. In 1941, what prompted me, they came

31:14.185 --> 31:20.954
out with what they call this year's active duty. 
And I talked to my partner, and we agreed I'd go

31:21.955 --> 31:31.007
ahead and get it off. So I went on duty April 15, 
1941. And my orders read that I'd be returned to my

31:35.513 --> 31:43.804
home of record by 15 April, 1941.

31:47.210 --> 31:51.295
You returned in 1946. That's right. It's strange 
how the military works. Well, sometime during

31:54.299 --> 32:10.318
that year, I got a notice from regimental 
headquarters asking to volunteer for three, six,

31:54.299 --> 32:10.318
nine, or 12 months of digital service. I put a zero 
and sent it in. Why is that? Did you want to stand?

32:15.665 --> 32:16.626
Well, I had a business going. There wasn't any real 
evidence

32:17.028 --> 32:23.974
of war at the business school. And some, what I 
would say, sizable investment at the time. So I got

32:28.498 --> 32:34.003
called into the Adjutant's office, and he said, 
you can't do that. So I think I selected six months.

32:36.705 --> 32:43.311
Of course, it all went by the board in December 7. 
But that was the original. And

32:45.614 --> 32:56.108
of course, I went down to the San Antonio Reserve 
Headquarters and they said, well, we'll have to

32:45.614 --> 32:56.108
check the file. They opened it up. Of course, there 
wasn't anything in it. I got my order a few days

33:00.734 --> 33:03.177
later. So where was your first active duty 
station, 30th Field Artillery 1941? Well, the

33:08.904 --> 33:13.410
first active duty station was Fort Art, 
California. 7th Division Artillery School that

33:14.453 --> 33:27.390
they formed.

33:28.652 --> 33:34.039
Because all of us were assigned to the 26th Field 
Artillery Brigade. And the 7th Division was

33:36.382 --> 33:42.891
instructed to set up this school to train these new 
coming officers.

33:45.672 --> 34:10.947
And at that time, they had a 155 howitzer battalion 
and three historic horse-drawn light

33:45.672 --> 34:10.947
battalions, 74th, 75th, and 76th Real Artillery, 
who had been in the Meuse-Argonne Forest.

34:10.967 --> 34:14.852
So they had brown horse batteries, black horse 
batteries.

34:17.397 --> 34:20.380
This wasn't a year. No, this was about six weeks.

34:27.107 --> 34:29.249
Just shortly thereafter. And

34:29.329 --> 34:41.361
then we went down to King Proverbs to form the 26th 
Field Artillery Brigade, which I was attached. My

34:41.922 --> 34:47.387
initial assignment, I was TDY at 7th Division 
Artillery My initial assignment was to the 155 Gun

34:48.498 --> 34:55.569
Regiment. The brigade was two 155 Howard's 
Regiments and one 155 Gun Regiment. And they were

35:02.500 --> 35:03.962
formed the Gun Regiment. So I was reassigned to the 
30th Field Artillery Regiment, one of the 155 Gun

35:05.925 --> 35:15.720
Regiments, Howard's Regiment. No. I've never 
fired a round of artillery in anger in my life. I was

35:29.897 --> 35:40.910
reassigned as battery exec of the anti-tank 
battery.

35:40.930 --> 35:45.555
And then in after December the 7th when all hell 
broke loose on the West Coast.

35:51.142 --> 36:11.121
In fact,

35:51.142 --> 36:11.121
one of the better things to do, we rushed up to San 
Jose State and Fort Ord and assembled four

35:51.142 --> 36:11.121
75-millimeter

35:51.142 --> 36:11.121
guns. Well, I'm not sure they knew what it was for. 
But Our anti-tank battery had to train those. Two

36:19.030 --> 36:23.696
of those guns had French sights and two American 
sights. So when you laid the battery, you'd say,

36:23.716 --> 36:30.905
gun number one, deflection 180. Gun number two, 
deflection 183. Gun number three, plateau 10,

36:34.990 --> 36:38.213
drum 10. Gun number four, plateau 10, drum 16.

36:48.732 --> 36:57.684
But our first job, two days after that, was to guard 
Moffett Field against a parachute attack. There

36:57.704 --> 37:02.810
was a lot of fear of the Japanese who were going to 
invade out on the west coast. Well, you know, some

37:02.830 --> 37:07.436
of them surfaced in Shelter Beach out there. But 
after things settled down a little bit, oh, it was

37:07.456 --> 37:15.146
horrible, really. They pulled us. out all the 
anti-tank batteries. And from it, we formed the

37:21.244 --> 37:28.475
826th Tank Star Battalion.

37:28.495 --> 37:41.895
And an interesting sidelight, General Jim 
Hannigan, who used to be Dean of Student Affairs,

37:28.495 --> 37:41.895
he was a battery exec, and I was S-4.

37:42.456 --> 37:44.018
I went on active duty, and April 15th, 41, and got 
promoted to captain in February of 42. And Jim

37:52.728 --> 38:03.325
Hannigan and Doris White and I, we've known 35 
years. But... Were you still on the California in

38:04.447 --> 38:08.073
February of 42? Mm-hmm. But during February 1942, 
they started to round up the Japanese Americans

38:08.568 --> 38:14.999
out there and send them to relocation centers. Did 
you have anything to do with that? No, we had some in

38:16.262 --> 38:18.566
and out. We had a sergeant who was transferred out. 
Now, he was in the military, so I think he went to

38:21.772 --> 38:28.363
that Japanese regiment. I never did know what it 
was. 414, yeah. But we had nothing to do with that.

38:34.083 --> 38:40.493
We had our own

38:34.083 --> 38:40.493
job to do because we were essentially combat 
units. And we formed the 826th Tank Squadron at

38:40.513 --> 38:48.525
that point. And shortly thereafter, we pulled out 
of Camp Roberts and went down the march It wasn't

39:00.627 --> 39:04.632
known as March Air Force Base now. It was March 
Field then. And the entire battalion at the guard

39:05.152 --> 39:09.657
post. And I was officer of the day for 48 hours every

39:09.677 --> 39:20.510
14 days. I started out as F-4 and then I became 
company commander. 48 hours straight? Yes, sir.

39:29.990 --> 39:31.231
We're supposed to stay up? I mean, were they not? 
No, no. No, you were officer today for 48 hours.

39:38.779 --> 39:40.921
No, you got some sleep. But the regulations then, 
you had to inspect the guard at periodic

39:40.961 --> 39:46.146
intervals. And the regulations stated then, I 
think it had been slightly changed now, slightly

39:46.166 --> 39:52.632
altered. Between midnight and daylight, you had 
to inspect it. And off the Apache Mountains, it was

39:56.180 --> 39:59.404
cold. I put on long underwear and short coat and 
climbed in that Jeep because it took a 17-mile ride

39:59.424 --> 40:07.235
to make off the coast. And

40:07.355 --> 40:12.983
of course, they were absolutely frightened to 
death. See, once the planes hit the coast, they

40:14.004 --> 40:20.072
could see Marchville.

40:20.092 --> 40:22.896
And I forget what was there. Sure enough, the alert 
was a blue alert. They even blew a blue alert one

40:27.482 --> 40:29.644
night. It was false,

40:29.664 --> 40:36.591
but it was hard.

40:36.611 --> 40:46.862
And then on top of it, we got in 150 recruits, okay, 
direct from the river station. So they were raw

40:46.882 --> 40:49.765
recruits that you had to train? Yes, sir. I had to 
take one of my... company officers and put him in

40:54.044 --> 40:57.669
charge of it. And

40:57.689 --> 41:05.159
we trained them for six weeks. But

41:05.219 --> 41:11.688
they came right direct from the railroad station. 
And we managed. That was hard duty there. What kind

41:20.521 --> 41:26.828
of equipment did you have as a tank destroyer?

41:27.509 --> 41:29.311
How were you going to destroy the tanks? Well, it 
was with a tank destroyer. But first of all, I think

41:34.537 --> 41:40.304
we had some anti-tank guns. But see, we went from 
there. My sequence is correct. back to Camp

41:50.710 --> 41:56.500
Roberts.

41:56.520 --> 41:59.425
Then from Camp Roberts, we went to Fort Hood, 
Texas.

42:02.791 --> 42:10.184
And Fort Hood was a foundation stone building, so 
we were out at the boondocks and the air land

42:02.791 --> 42:10.184
passes. I remember a general came to visit us one 
day. And he stood before our battalion and said he

42:14.555 --> 42:20.561
was going to take guns and guns to win this war. And I 
could hear a soft little voice say, we're going to

42:20.581 --> 42:27.608
take a whole lot of guns from you guys. So you were 
short on equipment? Very short. And it was

42:32.532 --> 42:42.402
somebody's theory that a tank destroyer would 
destroy tanks. like a tank, but an open turret. And

42:47.236 --> 42:49.360
we trained and trained and trained as that. And we 
went to the Moabe Desert and went on summer

42:49.481 --> 43:02.145
maneuvers all over the desert, which was kind of 
fun, really. You didn't get overseas until 1944.

43:06.092 --> 43:10.018
Were you eager to get overseas as a unit? You were 
basically trained that for three years.

43:15.787 --> 43:16.508
Yes and no.

43:19.292 --> 43:23.038
Because we trained and trained. I went to advanced 
tank patrol school

43:23.118 --> 43:29.067
in Fort Hood. And then the Army discovered that 
They sent a few tank destroyers to Europe. Then the

43:36.675 --> 43:41.582
Army discovered that the best tank destroyer was 
another tank.

43:44.466 --> 43:51.777
So we were converted into the 826th Amphibious 
Tractor Battalion. And why tractor? Sir? Why

43:53.579 --> 43:56.283
tractor? Well, it's an entirely different 
mission. These were known as amphibious

43:59.618 --> 44:08.706
tractors, same as which Marines landed in 
Guadalcanal. And they needed some amphibious

44:10.468 --> 44:17.534
tractor battalions. So after all that work and 
that, then we went to Fort Ord, California for

44:17.795 --> 44:27.904
amphibious training.

44:31.073 --> 44:34.938
And we went overseas.

44:36.701 --> 44:47.115
Now, did you have an opinion on where you'd rather 
fight, either in Europe or in the Pacific? I guess

44:47.796 --> 44:49.038
I'm a soldier. I go where I'm told to go. In 
retrospect, I think I'd rather have fought in

44:53.084 --> 44:58.431
Europe, a civilized country. By the same token, 
I'm alive, and I might have

44:59.812 --> 45:08.745
been dead. Those South Pacific islands are not 
very attractive. And I was in quite a few of them.

45:22.565 --> 45:25.870
And our first hint of civilization

45:28.111 --> 45:30.434
Well, let's continue the story then. You went over 
in September of 1944. That was your first overseas

45:32.617 --> 45:35.300
tour. Where'd they send you? The unit went ahead of 
me. I stayed back in San Francisco. Why? To get the

45:45.053 --> 45:46.975
equipment. Oh, okay. I stayed back there for about 
30 days. It was a nice tour. In fact, they were

45:53.584 --> 45:55.907
paying me $300 a month. ration quarters to stay 
back. I loaded with money. I'd make an $800 a month

46:01.426 --> 46:05.931
major. And see, I was a tax executive. And so I 
joined them in the Admiralty Islands, which

46:10.436 --> 46:25.793
they had two islands,

46:10.436 --> 46:25.793
Los Negros and Those

46:28.102 --> 46:36.170
islands are in Seattle Harbor. Have you ever heard 
of Seattle Harbor? No. It's a huge, huge harbor. It

46:40.254 --> 46:48.222
was supposed to have been discovered by the German 
raider in World War I, Captain Seattle. You

46:48.242 --> 46:55.249
couldn't really put the whole city fleet in there 
until that wouldn't turn around. And it was a

46:55.269 --> 46:57.231
major... installation of the Navy. In fact, they 
brought in a floating
