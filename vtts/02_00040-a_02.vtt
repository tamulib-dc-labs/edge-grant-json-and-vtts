WEBVTT

00:02.393 --> 00:09.082
Who were the playmates that were numerous enough 
for you to play a baseball game or basketball?

00:10.003 --> 00:25.725
Well, on the block that we lived on, there were two 
duplices that were reserved,

00:10.003 --> 00:25.725
I guess, for the military people. And from time to 
time, there were, I can remember three. families

00:32.178 --> 00:39.427
that lived next door to us in one of the duplexes 
that all had two or three children. There was

00:40.929 --> 00:51.401
Captain Lines and Major Stickney and Captain 
Marcus and all of them, they all had children. And

00:52.082 --> 00:57.028
they'd be there three, four, five years and then 
the military would be transferred. But some of the

00:57.048 --> 01:00.312
ones that were raised There was Brooks Colfer, who 
lived down the street. John Sandstedt, Dillard

01:05.354 --> 01:11.902
Spriggs, and Joe Orr. All of them were the sons and 
daughters of faculty members. In terms of the

01:22.133 --> 01:30.703
social status on the campus, was there any part of 
the campus where there was greater prestige of

01:31.088 --> 01:35.113
living here than living there? Well, I suppose, 
looking back on it, there was, but it never

01:35.733 --> 01:46.446
occurred to me that we weren't as good or as bad as 
anybody else, you know? And we lived in a, I guess

01:46.506 --> 02:00.522
the college position would be one of the more 
prestigious positions, and we lived next door to

01:46.506 --> 02:00.522
him, you know? next on the other side dean marsh 
steller of dean of the veterinary school and next

02:00.805 --> 02:30.745
door to him was dean kyle the head of the dean of the 
ag the school of agriculture and so you know that we

02:00.805 --> 02:30.745
we live right there in that neighborhood uh the 
president of the college lived uh half a block from

02:00.805 --> 02:30.745
us so uh you know and i said i said i suppose there 
were I know that most of the men that worked in the

02:31.315 --> 02:59.854
building college utilities, the painters, the 
plumbers, and the carpenters, and the people that

02:31.315 --> 02:59.854
ran the power plant and all, lived in the area near 
the power plant, but it didn't occur to me that that

02:31.315 --> 02:59.854
was any, a blue collar area, but looking back on it, 
they lived over there because that's where they

03:00.543 --> 03:05.508
were. Where they lived in the area of the BNCE 
department. There was an area where Dean Bolton

03:09.312 --> 03:23.707
lived and the commandant, whoever happened to be 
commandant at that time, and the deans of several

03:09.312 --> 03:23.707
other areas.

03:25.729 --> 03:28.812
Dr. Gammon, who was I guess he was the history 
department chairman. In those days, I guess they

03:34.499 --> 03:38.983
were departments, weren't they? The history 
department. He was the chairman of the history

03:39.483 --> 03:42.306
department. Dr. Liam, I think, was the 
accountant.

03:47.831 --> 03:49.632
Knox Walker's daddy. I guess he was Knox Walker, 
too.

03:54.537 --> 03:59.001
If I'm not mistaken, was in charge of all the 
building the engineering for Prairie View and

04:00.837 --> 04:05.822
Tarleton. He lived on the Indian campus. Did you 
have a special buddy? Well, I spent more time with

04:11.567 --> 04:18.734
Jack Marsh because he lived next door, and he's a 
bit older. That was attractive to me. Now, where

04:22.278 --> 04:29.545
could you and your brother and three or four 
others, what did you all do, if anything, for

04:22.278 --> 04:29.545
mischief? Well, I remember one time we were going 
to have a war with all the kids that lived off the

04:31.128 --> 04:38.239
campus in College Park. And we, the marshes had a 
big, they had an old barn behind the house that had

04:39.281 --> 04:52.321
been converted into a garage, but still had a loft. 
And we armed the loft with China berries and all

05:00.203 --> 05:04.049
sorts of stuff and waited for them to attack us. But 
they didn't, they didn't show up and that

05:05.592 --> 05:12.262
afternoon we wound up having a touch football game 
on the field. So I guess the war, but we, I don't

05:12.943 --> 05:22.539
know, we played cowboys and Indians and cops and 
robbers.

05:25.123 --> 05:27.747
What were the, were there any in your family Were 
there any rules, any forbidden things that y'all

05:28.115 --> 05:32.380
were to do on the campus? Well, we weren't supposed 
to go in the dormitories. I remember that on

05:39.469 --> 05:52.746
Sunday, if we didn't go to Sunday school and we 
didn't go to church, we didn't go to free show and we

05:39.469 --> 05:52.746
didn't play touch football.

05:53.527 --> 05:54.628
I remember I At one point, I decided that I wasn't 
going to Sunday school to church. I said, okay,

06:02.671 --> 06:05.734
stay home. And when my folks got home that 
afternoon, or at noon from church, we had lunch,

06:05.754 --> 06:18.388
and so I got ready to go to the movie, and they wanted 
to know where I thought I was going. I said, I was

06:18.408 --> 06:19.549
going to the free show. They said, you didn't go to 
Sunday school? You didn't go to church? I said, I

06:22.212 --> 06:23.974
had no free show for you this afternoon. No 
football, and I had a pretty difficult time.

06:32.172 --> 06:39.763
If they didn't have a touch football game on Sunday 
close to the house, I didn't get to play. I couldn't

06:39.783 --> 06:40.324
go. There's nearly always a touch football game 
somewhere around Kyle Field, and on Sunday

06:40.705 --> 06:50.479
afternoon I couldn't go. I remember one time, I 
was, when I was a freshman at A&M that first summer,

06:53.587 --> 07:05.262
I had walked on, and the football team, we 
practiced all summer long. There were, I guess

07:05.282 --> 07:10.468
during the war, there were no particular rules 
about it. And Coach Norton had put in the

07:11.049 --> 07:14.914
T-formation. That was the first time they'd ever 
used the T-formation. Dick Todd, who was an

07:20.654 --> 07:28.342
All-American at one time, was playing for the Iowa 
Seahawks. And he got a weekend pass and came down to

07:29.303 --> 07:36.971
do some special work with us. And Coach Norton, he 
was going to be there Friday, Saturday, and

07:38.252 --> 07:42.617
Sunday. And he wanted us to work out on Sunday. And I 
had an awful hard time asking my dad. on Sunday, but

07:50.945 --> 08:01.522
he didn't seem to, I don't know whether he minded or 
not, but he didn't object. Right now, when you're

08:01.542 --> 08:07.772
in junior, senior high, got a bicycle, where would 
y'all ride off to? I'd

08:07.812 --> 08:13.581
maybe go to Kyle Field. Because there wasn't a 
creek anywhere nearby to go swimming or fishing.

08:17.747 --> 08:18.268
Well, we'd We went fishing in the zoo lake once in a 
while. The zoo, do you remember where the creamery

08:23.299 --> 08:26.041
used to be?

08:28.504 --> 08:31.507
West of the creamery. That one time there was a zoo. 
They had lions and tigers. And they had dug out an

08:36.692 --> 08:40.555
old U-shaped lake. And in the U, the YMCA had built a 
canyon. In fact, they took three of the shacks that

08:48.657 --> 08:56.385
the students used to live in and put them together 
in the form of a T. And that was the Y cabin. The Y

08:56.606 --> 08:57.246
cabin. And it was later, if I'm not mistaken, moved 
to Hensel Park and named Cashin cabin. I think it's

09:06.857 --> 09:10.020
been remodeled, but it's still named Cashin 
cabin. Anyway, there was a lake that had some perch

09:10.721 --> 09:18.529
in it and we used to, my dad loved to fish. And we'd go 
down there and fish with the cane and pole. And that

09:24.278 --> 09:30.487
was where he had his steak fries for his YMCA 
cabinet and other student groups. In today's

09:30.507 --> 09:41.764
terms, how diverse was the population that you 
remember of campus and friends and NM Solid Age

09:30.507 --> 09:41.764
students? Not diverse at all. So no Hispanics, no 
blacks? The blacks were the ones that I knew worked

09:48.007 --> 09:54.693
as servants. Cooks,

09:55.173 --> 10:05.923
maids, the main ones that I knew that I knew best 
worked in the hospital. Where did they live? Well

10:08.926 --> 10:15.972
behind each house on the campus there was a small 
one-room house that was made available to these

10:16.272 --> 10:17.453
people. Most of them live along Weldon Road from

10:17.513 --> 10:37.397
Uncle Ed's Beer Joint south

10:17.513 --> 10:37.397
till the highway across the railroad track. There 
was a whole area just small houses that primarily

10:42.412 --> 10:49.721
black people lived in. I remember they had

10:49.741 --> 10:58.753
a, just a beer jar called the Green Lantern. And it 
was about halfway between what's now the corner of

10:58.773 --> 11:10.208
Bush Drive and Weldon Road and The highway used to 
go on the east side of the railroad

11:10.863 --> 11:31.090
down to about where 2818 crosses, and then it 
crossed over and went on the west side until it got

11:10.863 --> 11:31.090
to Welber, and then it crossed back over and went on 
the east side to Milliken. And all on that, where

11:31.110 --> 11:39.621
the highway was on the east side, were just small 
houses that were primarily black people. You

11:40.867 --> 11:44.431
mentioned Uncle Ed's. Was Uncle Ed's there as 
early as you can remember? Describe it and what it

11:48.896 --> 11:53.421
was and who went there. I never did go in Uncle Ed's 
very often, but it was a beer joint. The nearest

12:00.389 --> 12:06.456
thing I think of right now would be a convenience 
store or an ice house. They had that little room

12:06.717 --> 12:09.540
where you They had some tables and the guys could 
get beer there. I guess in that precinct, they sold

12:14.211 --> 12:16.313
beer. And as far as you know, it was legal. Yes, it 
was legal. It was legal and he had a grocery store

12:20.578 --> 12:36.355
and that's where the people that lived down there 
bought their groceries from Eiffel Head and I'm

12:20.578 --> 12:36.355
sure he had some sort of a charge account with them. 
Now, was this, was he Herdlicka? Is it Ed

12:42.119 --> 12:43.320
Herdlicka? Yeah, I will call it Hardlicka. I don't 
know. Okay, that's what I was going to say.

12:48.187 --> 12:48.828
H-R-D-L-C-K-A or something. So that, because 
I've heard some people refer to Hardlickers, and

12:49.249 --> 12:54.776
so Uncle Ed's is the same. Now, did people go there, 
as far as you know, and really get drunk, or did they

12:55.197 --> 13:03.288
go and have a beer or two? Probably both. Okay. 
Probably both. You know, in the song that was

13:06.642 --> 13:24.125
written for the Aggieland Orchestra about I'd 
rather be a Texas Aggie, one of the phrases in

13:06.642 --> 13:24.125
there, we'll go to Uncle Ed's and drink our cares 
away, that's what they're talking about. Was, as

13:24.606 --> 13:32.576
far as you know, if an Aggie had a date, would it have 
been acceptable to take the date to Uncle Ed's? Or

13:33.237 --> 13:34.759
was it pretty well a male only? Well, I'm sure it was 
pretty well male only, because there were only

13:35.549 --> 13:43.839
males on the campus, you know, for the most part. 
And I really can't tell you a whole lot about it,

13:44.560 --> 13:58.656
because I was, I mean, I didn't go to that kind of 
place as a child, you know, obviously. Now, you

13:59.137 --> 14:01.860
mentioned another place down the... The Wilburn 
Road. Well, the Green Ladder, but that was the

14:03.194 --> 14:06.177
Black Force. Oh, okay. That was their beer joint. 
Okay. Was there, there was nothing on the East Gate

14:10.621 --> 14:17.288
to speak of, was there? The East Gate, no, there was 
no East Gate until they built Highway 6. But I mean,

14:22.153 --> 14:24.936
by World War II. By World War II, they had that East 
entrance, yes. But was there any kind of... Well,

14:31.017 --> 14:36.405
there were, let's see, out on the highway, there 
were two service stations that I can remember. The

14:36.425 --> 14:46.058
first one was Grant's Gulf Station, and it's on the 
corner where the Chevron Station is now next to the

14:36.425 --> 14:46.058
High Rise Hotel. It was Grant's Gulf. Right across 
the street, there was a Phillips Station. And down

14:52.968 --> 15:00.619
the highway south, just between there and the 
entrance, there was Black's Pharmacy. And there

15:01.122 --> 15:07.110
was a, there were two services out there, Texaco 
and Exxon. I was a homeboy at that time. And there

15:10.775 --> 15:24.815
was a hamburger joint out there called,

15:10.775 --> 15:24.815
let's

15:10.775 --> 15:24.815
see, what was his name? I can't remember that now. 
It may come to me. He had just a small building out

15:30.198 --> 15:52.183
there about where, you

15:30.198 --> 15:52.183
know,

15:30.198 --> 15:52.183
somewhere, it was right on the highway, but it was 
about where Barnes and Noble is, somewhere along

15:30.198 --> 15:52.183
in there. It was just a hamburger joint, a beer 
joint. All right, go to Northgate. What was at

15:57.121 --> 16:00.865
Northgate when you were high school, junior, and 
senior high? Northgate, there were two drug

16:00.945 --> 16:04.889
stores on the corner. Maidley's Pharmacy and the 
Aguland Pharmacy. Wait, at Northgate,

16:07.512 --> 16:08.973
Maidley's? Oh. No, no, no, no, no. Not Maidley's. 
It was Lipscomb. I'm sorry. Lipscomb. Maidley was

16:17.782 --> 16:20.485
at the Southgate. But the Aguland Pharmacy was the 
first one. And it's the photo shop. Mm-hmm. And

16:26.493 --> 16:34.905
then

16:26.493 --> 16:34.905
Dr. Lipscomb may have had a hand in building it. And 
then he later built another Lipscomb Pharmacy

16:34.925 --> 16:40.212
right across the street. Where Lupo is. Right. Was 
Lou in business then? Lou was in business sometime

16:46.241 --> 16:50.006
in the 30s. But there was a little building. down 
toward the campus theater. It was separate, just a

16:56.198 --> 16:59.923
little wooden building, separate. In the block 
there where the Lipscomb Pharmacy was, behind it,

17:00.103 --> 17:14.404
there was,

17:00.103 --> 17:14.404
what was the man's name that made uniforms?

17:16.865 --> 17:29.637
I can't remember his name, but then there was the 
grocery store back there, Luke and Charlie's

17:16.865 --> 17:29.637
Grocery Store, and the photo shop, I mean, 
Hollick's. Soslick's. Soslick's Photography

17:31.018 --> 17:34.161
was on the farm. Across the street there was the 
Hollick's Boot Shop, Lauterstein's Cleaners,

17:34.181 --> 17:43.530
and I can't think of the man's name that was the 
tailor. But he, one of the things that we all, he

17:45.603 --> 17:54.754
tailor-made

17:45.603 --> 17:54.754
military slats. And most of us were pretty pencil 
thin, and he built, he did, I can't think of what his

17:54.774 --> 18:08.010
name was now, but he was there for years and years. 
And then the, in terms of the churches, the Baptist

18:08.591 --> 18:12.796
and... The Baptist church was on, were behind, on 
the right side, across the street from the Church

18:16.383 --> 18:20.689
of Christ. And then the Methodist Church was 
behind the Baptist Church. The Catholic Church

18:25.194 --> 18:27.017
was on down the street.

18:30.742 --> 18:33.345
And for the most part, these were separate 
buildings. You know, I mean, A.M. Waldrop had a

18:33.365 --> 18:45.681
uniform shop there, and a barber was a barber shop 
next to the Agland Inn, I mean, Agland Pharmacy.

18:46.066 --> 18:57.241
barbershop and then A.M. Walters Uniform and 
there was a jewelry store next to the barbershop.

18:57.261 --> 18:59.664
Now let's see, let's go back to your high school. 
You all had football, organized football team at

19:00.345 --> 19:04.250
the high school? Football, I think the first year 
was in 1935 or 6. And who played? The

19:12.323 --> 19:22.295
first game that was ever played was against Willow 
Hole. And Willow Hole was a rural school just south

19:23.977 --> 19:33.950
of . The church is still there. Willow Hole Baptist 
Church is still there. And there was a school

19:39.156 --> 19:40.778
there. And the first game that Consolidated ever 
played was at Senior Field, Willow Hole, and I had a

19:41.332 --> 19:52.086
ticket.

19:53.227 --> 19:58.093
Do you remember any discussion as to how the mascot 
was selected? They were the Tigers. One thing

20:01.698 --> 20:09.668
that's kind of interesting though, of course the 
colors were maroon and white,

20:12.365 --> 20:20.938
At one time, the A&M annual was the longhorn, and 
the annual for the skills was the shorthorn. And

20:23.261 --> 20:30.152
then they changed it to the Aggieland, and they 
changed the one that consulted it to the

20:23.261 --> 20:30.152
Tigerland. Okay. Now, were they playing 
basketball and baseball before football? No, no.

20:37.203 --> 20:38.845
So that sports... and see it, and then they had a 
basketball team, but they didn't have a gym. And so

20:46.214 --> 20:58.084
the only practice that we got was the A&M down by 
DeWare Field House, there was a wooden gym, they

20:46.214 --> 20:58.084
called it the Little Gym. It had three or four 
handball courts and a basketball court. And we

21:04.010 --> 21:09.034
practiced in the Little Gym When we could, but they 
used it for intraburals and so on, and so sometimes

21:09.757 --> 21:20.728
it got to be just on the weekend.

21:20.788 --> 21:27.875
And the basketball season consisted of about 
eight or ten games, if I'm not wrong. And football,

21:27.895 --> 21:35.443
we also, we played, one year we played marquee for 
the district championship. And Marquette had a

21:36.858 --> 21:41.243
team, Jewett. Those two schools are consolidated 
now, Leon. And we played Buffalo. We played, the

21:47.569 --> 21:52.995
first game I ever played in was at Dayton, Texas. We 
went down to Dayton and played then. Now with that,

21:54.897 --> 21:58.301
were y'all class B? We were class B and I think at 
that time there were only maybe two or three

21:58.321 --> 22:03.186
classes. Double A, A and B is all I knew of. As a Class 
B school, we only played by district. The first

22:15.344 --> 22:24.654
year I was in high school, the district was divided 
into two zones. We won the South Zone. The South

22:26.837 --> 22:33.544
Zone was Consolidated, and Snook, and Beat Eyes, 
and Owl, and North Zoo. And in the north end of the

22:34.503 --> 22:48.003
zone, there was Jewett, Marquet,

22:34.503 --> 22:48.003
Buffalo,

22:34.503 --> 22:48.003
and maybe Normandy, I'm not sure. But anyway, we 
played Marquet in Bryan at the old Forest Stadium

22:48.023 --> 22:57.516
in Bryan. And Marquet beat us. And the next year, 
the next year we played Buffalo in Madisonville

23:04.658 --> 23:08.222
for the district championship. And we beat 
Buffalo and played Wortham in the bi-district and

23:08.242 --> 23:18.213
they beat us. And then in the next two years we won 
bi-district. Now, where in high school, where did

23:22.357 --> 23:34.530
y'all have social events like a senior prom or a... 
Well, I remember the We didn't have a prom, but we

23:34.814 --> 23:36.957
had a banquets. Junior senior banquets. Where 
would you have that? My junior year, we had it in the

23:40.020 --> 23:45.968
library study hall. A study hall was probably the 
size of two classrooms and a library on one end of

23:45.988 --> 23:55.480
it. Oh, in the old high school building. Okay, on 
campus. Right, on campus. My senior year, they had

24:02.101 --> 24:09.609
built a gym, and so we had the junior-senior 
banquet in the gymnasium. In the new A&M Salt Lake

24:10.129 --> 24:13.933
building off campus? Well, the gym has been torn 
down. No, but I mean it was new then. Yes, it was new

24:16.676 --> 24:18.858
then. All right. When you and your buddies wanted 
to have a social Saturday night in high school,

24:21.982 --> 24:30.010
where did you all go? Generally... If we didn't go 
to somebody's house, we went to a movie. Probably

24:35.403 --> 24:44.575
Brian, the Palace Theater, or the Campus Theater, 
which was open in those days. And that was

24:45.817 --> 24:49.943
primarily the dates. We'd go to a movie and then, 
you know, to a drive-in. or to somebody's house. We

24:59.474 --> 25:03.779
did lots of socializing in people's homes. Now, as 
far as you recall, what were

25:03.799 --> 25:21.422
the boundaries of adult, talking about your 
parents now, of adult conduct then for faculty and

25:03.799 --> 25:21.422
staff members? What are the things that they just 
did not, wouldn't have thought about doing?

25:27.750 --> 25:28.251
Well, let me see. I don't know. I guess I can only 
speak for my own parents. I never saw them take a

25:34.883 --> 25:41.069
drink. They may have, but there never was any 
liquor of any sort in our home. As far as you know,

25:47.496 --> 25:52.262
when they went to someone else's, was it similar? 
Yes, as far as I know. That's what I understand. You

25:58.690 --> 26:02.774
know, the kinds of things they did were also in 
people's homes. They played lots of dominoes, 42.

26:06.697 --> 26:12.643
Were there any games that just, did they ever play, 
did they play cards? Yeah, they played cards.

26:14.744 --> 26:15.325
Bridge? Bridge, there was bridge and pinochle. 
Did anybody ever play any games for money? If they

26:21.651 --> 26:23.072
did, I didn't know. Okay. Did they go to, did they go 
to dances?

26:31.883 --> 26:40.452
Well, I think, if I'm not mistaken, they 
chaperoned some of the Nazis.

26:43.976 --> 26:58.471
Occasionally, I can remember a time or two, my 
folks going to some sort of social functions that

26:43.976 --> 26:58.471
were more than just visiting somebody's home, but 
I can't tell you what they did. Divorce. I didn't

27:00.841 --> 27:05.266
know anybody at the board. And I didn't know any 
women that I didn't know any women that smoked.

27:11.333 --> 27:17.300
There was an awful lot of social activity with 
churches.

27:20.664 --> 27:28.613
The women's circles and that sort of thing were the 
circle meetings once a month were big social

27:20.664 --> 27:28.613
things. Were there any allegations as to which 
church denomination was favored at A&M? Not that I

27:38.909 --> 27:40.491
know of. They

27:40.531 --> 27:55.530
had a big group, you know, and the Presbyterian 
church was

27:40.531 --> 27:55.530
pretty noticeable because they met on the campus. 
And as far as I know there was no stigma to the

27:59.228 --> 28:06.936
church, giving preference to one or the other. And 
as I recall, but I'm not sure what the procedure

28:07.497 --> 28:19.890
was, but at one time, I think they had a chapel. And 
the students were required to attend chapel. But I

28:23.394 --> 28:26.097
don't know who ran it. Now, who was the president of 
A&M when you were growing up? Well, Dr. Walton, for

28:30.559 --> 28:37.285
the most part, and then Gib Gilchrist. Describe 
President Gilchrist, or Dean Gilchrist. He

28:41.008 --> 28:41.789
wasn't first. Dean Gilchrist, yes. Well, Dean 
Gilchrist was quite an imposing figure. He was

28:49.515 --> 28:56.421
tall, and I guess he was pretty stubborn. one of the 
things that everybody held against him was he went

28:56.789 --> 29:05.966
to the University of Texas.

29:07.148 --> 29:11.436
But he ran things pretty much with an iron fist. You 
know the story about his, right after the war,

29:11.456 --> 29:20.232
there seemed to be between the corps and the 
non-corps,

29:20.650 --> 29:32.609
the veterans. And the corps, I don't remember 
exactly what it was all about, but the officers

29:32.629 --> 29:47.552
were gonna resign and they marched to the 
president's home and gave him an ultimatum and he

29:32.629 --> 29:47.552
said, well, wait a minute, guys. put a box out 
there, put all your buttons and diamonds in the box

29:48.595 --> 29:55.667
and go back home, go to class. And he took their 
resignation, his officers in the Corps stopped

29:56.809 --> 30:02.298
the revolt, whatever it was. And I'm not 
absolutely sure that what I've said is correct for

30:02.398 --> 30:13.356
the record, but I think it's pretty well 
documented. Something like that happened. Of the

30:15.072 --> 30:21.237
presidents that your dad dealt with, did he have 
any favorite that he respected most? Well, of

30:21.858 --> 30:24.880
course, there was some tie. My mother and Gib 
Gilchrist's families went back to Willisville.

30:32.807 --> 30:33.207
Oh, that's right. That's right. And so I don't 
suppose there was any favoritism, but from a

30:34.028 --> 30:44.877
family standpoint, we were closer to the 
Gilchrist than we were to the Wildcats. Because, I

30:45.042 --> 30:54.556
mean, my mother and Gibb Gilchrist were... Henry 
is... Henry's the son. He's... I think Henry's two

30:57.440 --> 31:01.286
years older than I am. He was two years ahead of me in 
consolidation. Because he has told me, I haven't

31:03.249 --> 31:10.459
interviewed him yet, but just in conversation, he 
said when they moved here, I believe he said he was

31:03.249 --> 31:10.459
13... and his dad robbed him by buying him a new 
bicycle. Oh, really? And he thought, by

31:15.330 --> 31:23.362
comparison with the new house they left in Austin, 
that he had moved to a little old bitty country

31:15.330 --> 31:23.362
town. And he said at first it was hard for him to 
get... I can see why he moved from Austin to College

31:28.009 --> 31:31.414
Station. You'd think he moved to... Well, it 
probably was a country town. When...
