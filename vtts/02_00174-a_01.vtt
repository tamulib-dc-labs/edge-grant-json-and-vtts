anne pierce to chat about his student days uh

00:26.390 --> 00:32.016
Begin, please, Ken, introduce yourself to 
anybody that might hear this tape or read a

00:26.390 --> 00:32.016
transcription. Give a biographical summary 
before you got to A&M. Where'd you grow up? What did

00:37.102 --> 00:38.243
mom and dad do? Where'd you go to high school? 
Anything else you did of any importance before

00:39.965 --> 00:43.048
coming to A&M?

00:45.932 --> 00:56.363
Well, I was born in Snyder, Texas, and began 
elementary school in Hobbs, New Mexico, and moved

00:57.912 --> 01:18.148
to Brownwood, Texas, and lived there until my 
ninth grade, middle of my ninth grade year, and we

00:57.912 --> 01:18.148
moved to a farm in Fisher County, north of Robie, 
between Robie and Rotan. And I stayed there until I

01:19.934 --> 01:32.128
graduated from high school and came to A&M around

01:19.934 --> 01:32.128
the first of June, 1951. Mom and dad, what was your 
dad's profession? My dad ran a restaurant or ran

01:36.253 --> 01:47.747
cafes or restaurants, and he was a cook.

01:48.622 --> 01:50.144
But did you all end up farming? Yes. During the time 
that we lived in Fisher County, well, this had been

01:51.465 --> 01:58.973
a dream of his for many years. Going into the 
restaurant business was a necessity. Born of the

02:05.940 --> 02:13.768
drought and drought conditions and the 
depression years of the early 30s in Scurry

02:05.940 --> 02:13.768
County. And he had, his family lost their farm at 
that time. And so this was something that he, a way

02:23.946 --> 02:34.102
for him to have a paycheck, meager paycheck in the 
Skurry County. And he always dreamed of going back

02:34.222 --> 02:38.909
to the farm. And then after he got back to the farm, 
well, He had two boys that were approaching

02:44.292 --> 02:56.205
college age and he decided, well, the farm income 
might not be enough to get them educated. In both

02:56.946 --> 03:01.831
philosophical and real terms, why did you attend 
A&M? Why did you go to college? Whose idea was it and

03:03.673 --> 03:05.255
so forth? Well, going to college was something 
that my mother had always really hammered at me on.

03:15.028 --> 03:29.148
She went to East Texas State and was

03:15.028 --> 03:29.148
very adamant that her children would go to 
college. My dad did not finish high school, but he

03:29.368 --> 03:40.523
valued education from the other vantage of not 
having it and being very determined that his boys

03:41.212 --> 03:43.554
would have. And I had become interested in 
veterinary medicine. I really liked Texas Tech,

03:52.484 --> 04:03.996
which was the closest big school to us where we 
lived on the farm. But after

04:08.532 --> 04:19.342
I really decided that I was going to try to become a 
veterinarian while the vet school was at A&M, so

04:08.532 --> 04:19.342
that seemed the most reasonable place to go. 
Before you came to enroll, had you visited A&M?

04:24.728 --> 04:38.421
Yes, I'd been here two

04:24.728 --> 04:38.421
or three years in the spring for FFA events. I was 
involved in judging teams in high school, and I

04:38.907 --> 04:55.609
was fortunate enough to be on judging teams at the 
state level in state competition a couple of those

04:38.907 --> 04:55.609
years. What impression had A&M made on you, those 
visits?

05:02.358 --> 05:05.843
Well, it seemed like a very friendly place. We 
stayed in the dorm,

05:06.869 --> 05:21.133
having contacts with a couple of boys from Fisher 
County. And they would make arrangements for us to

05:21.574 --> 05:27.944
stay near them. And of course, there seemed to be a 
lot good activities going on among the students

05:35.067 --> 05:42.718
all the time, and it was really a big place to me. 
Those

05:42.758 --> 05:51.070
were the main things, I guess, that I remember. 
We're not trying to put Tech down or build it up, but

05:52.192 --> 06:01.345
as far as you knew, how did those two compare in 
reputation and so forth? You mentioned Tech

06:02.523 --> 06:03.745
before. Well,

06:05.988 --> 06:15.840
my impression was that A&M was kind of a different 
tier. I would have thought of McMurray College and

06:16.461 --> 06:32.462
Hardin-Simmons as being one level, and then Texas 
Tech would be another level, and then A&M would be

06:16.461 --> 06:32.462
one of the big schools. It really wasn't that big a 
school at that time. When you came to enroll, how

06:36.578 --> 06:42.485
did you get here? Who'd you come with? What did you 
bring? Describe that whole trip. I graduated,

06:49.633 --> 06:55.960
well, first let me say that I came for summer school 
in 1951. This was either the only year are one of two

07:00.877 --> 07:16.575
consecutive years that an experiment was run at 
A&M to have CORE for credit for freshmen in the

07:00.877 --> 07:16.575
summer. And it's kind of an, I guess, an 
exploration of whether this would be a way to

07:18.037 --> 07:30.411
accelerate, possibly accelerate a program for 
students at A&M since it was an all military school

07:30.948 --> 07:48.035
and it did, a person really couldn't gain and 
accelerate just by going to summer school because

07:30.948 --> 07:48.035
you couldn't get the ROTC off.

07:51.201 --> 07:57.090
So I graduated from high school and I believe it was 
about eight days later Well, my dad and another

07:58.302 --> 08:10.319
father, Mr. Herman, brought two boys down here. 
And

08:10.379 --> 08:15.746
they're the Herman Buick. So they had a big 
roadmaster that we rode down in in style. What did

08:21.875 --> 08:24.659
you bring, as far as you can recall? What stuff? 
Well, I knew that the uniforms would be provided,

08:26.821 --> 08:39.378
and

08:26.821 --> 08:39.378
we did, each of us had a footlocker. We'd gotten 
that information, and Mr. Herman was in the

08:39.918 --> 08:56.220
clothing business in Winters, Texas, and

08:39.918 --> 08:56.220
we, so he had ordered a good footlocker for each one 
of us that would have the proper dimensions and

08:56.538 --> 09:04.310
everything. And he had gotten some khaki, a couple 
of khaki shirts for each of us. We each had a couple

09:10.379 --> 09:21.737
of khaki shirts and some khakis and just

09:10.379 --> 09:21.737
sheets and towels and things. Anyway, it was all in 
that footlocker. whatever I took was just

09:24.196 --> 09:27.120
clothing items. And I don't remember bringing 
anything else. No radio? No. And no record player

09:35.052 --> 09:36.975
of any sort? No. And when you got here, how did you 
find your dormitory, your outfit, and that sort of

09:38.397 --> 09:45.887
thing? How did you get placed? Well...

09:56.461 --> 10:24.865
we stopped at the Aggieland Inn and there was a sign 
there pointing in it was a handmade sort of a sign to

09:56.461 --> 10:24.865
check where people were to check in and to get their 
directions and the freshmen that year that summer

09:56.461 --> 10:24.865
for summer school the freshmen were to live in the 
dorms

10:28.237 --> 10:56.877
fourteen and uh... fifteen i

10:28.237 --> 10:56.877
may be a little it's either fourteen i know it was 
fourteen because that was the air force dorm and i

10:28.237 --> 10:56.877
lived in fourteen and it was either fifteen or 
seventeen that was the uh... the uh... army dorm

10:28.237 --> 10:56.877
army corps dorm and uh... so there were four dorms 
over there and at that time there was also another,

10:57.363 --> 11:07.710
well there was Walton Hall and another small

11:09.513 --> 11:30.812
building that really wasn't a dorm i don't think 
but it was used to house some of the upperclassmen

11:09.513 --> 11:30.812
but uh all right so y'all did you spent the night in 
uh aggie land or did you just drive in and go we we

11:09.513 --> 11:30.812
just it was being used at that time it As far as I 
know, it was full of the

11:30.961 --> 11:38.462
student activities and those type of things. It 
was all offices as far as I could see at that time.

11:43.162 --> 11:51.732
But we got our instructions on where to go, and so 
our parents helped us move in. Our dads helped us

11:52.272 --> 11:55.015
get our things in. And I think Wilford had Herman, 
the boy, had a fan to real force that to bring it down

11:55.075 --> 12:10.553
because We really needed it. Do you remember what 
floor y'all were on? The first place, the very

12:17.053 --> 12:20.897
first room we had was on the first floor. Oh, so that 
was a warmer. Yeah, and it was on the north side so it

12:22.639 --> 12:29.887
would have been away from no breeze at all. And we 
got in and these two really nice upperclassmen

12:31.168 --> 12:39.797
stopped by and introduced themselves to our dads 
and just all smiles and, you know, boy, we were just

12:40.267 --> 12:47.394
thinking, what a nice place. Boy, these are a 
couple of real nice upperclassmen going to help us

12:47.434 --> 12:54.741
out, you know, and everything. So then our dads 
left after just a little while. Do you remember

13:02.107 --> 13:10.155
anything your dad said to you during those last few 
hours that stuck in your heart, your mind?

13:14.168 --> 13:16.953
No, I really don't. How much money did you have in 
your pocket, reckon?

13:27.911 --> 13:28.853
I don't remember that. Maybe 20, I just don't 
remember. It wasn't very much money, though. And

13:33.240 --> 13:37.527
do you have any idea what a semester or a year cost?

13:40.797 --> 13:41.598
No, I don't. But, of course, tuition was $25 a 
semester. And you're not one of these whose father

13:49.505 --> 13:57.752
gave him so many acres to farm for four years, and 
whatever he produced, that would be his college?

13:58.272 --> 13:58.572
No. Okay. Eddie Joe Davis, that happened to him up 
in Jacksboro. For four years, that was what he was

14:02.316 --> 14:04.257
to do. All right, so the father's left. Yeah. And we 
had been sort of straightening things out, you

14:09.957 --> 14:23.497
know, and decided it was already hot, being one of 
the first few days in June. So we kind of decided

14:23.617 --> 14:31.869
we'd lie down on the mattress before we made it up or 
anything. And we were lying there, and these same

14:33.471 --> 14:38.378
two nice upperclassmen came in. And boy, it hit the 
fan in a hurry then. So our education began at that

14:42.476 --> 14:47.862
point, I'd say. And what kind of orientation 
activities did those upperclassmen inflict? I

14:57.839 --> 15:04.989
remember that we were lying there and just kind of 
casually said, hi guys, or something like that, to

14:57.839 --> 15:04.989
that effect. And boy, one of them just bellowed 
out, you know, freshman, on your feet. And... hit a

15:17.035 --> 15:23.742
brace, and of course I didn't know what a brace was 
or anything, so they had to start from scratch.

15:24.823 --> 15:28.928
Then you go to, you eat at Duncan? No, Sabisa. 
Sabisa, and did y'all, as far as you recall, did you

15:30.329 --> 15:37.057
fall in to march to the first meal? Yeah, in a manner 
of speaking, and I've been trying to remember,

15:44.558 --> 15:52.588
think back on the sequence of this as to when the 
upperclassmen came in. But as best I remember, we

15:53.869 --> 16:07.286
had, I think we came in on one day, which meant then 
we marched to Chow that evening and the next

15:53.869 --> 16:07.286
morning. And that night, the first night, we were 
in the hall most of the evening. learning what we

16:14.663 --> 16:18.389
weren't to do and what we were to do.

16:23.959 --> 16:31.532
And after breakfast the next morning, well, we got 
our uniforms, walked over. We were marched over.

16:33.375 --> 16:40.047
And this

16:33.375 --> 16:40.047
was just east of Sabeasa. behind Milner Hall in 
that area that is now the cooling tower, right on

16:41.765 --> 16:55.184
that same area where the cooling tower is as I 
remember it. Of your uniforms, about what portion

16:55.885 --> 17:06.260
of your uniforms were new and what part were used, 
had turned by somebody else that had been turned

16:55.885 --> 17:06.260
in? I think Everything was used, I think. And so 
from then on, you're in full uniform. Yeah. And

17:20.975 --> 17:28.188
learning how to shine brass and shine and polish 
our shoes to everyone's satisfaction. Of course,

17:28.228 --> 17:29.811
we had a little bit of time. uh... in the middle or 
early after lunch we were instructed to if we

17:30.820 --> 17:55.157
didn't have our shoe polish and brasso and things 
like that there were stores at north gate that we

17:30.820 --> 17:55.157
could go get same and so we did some of that anyway 
how long before paddle was in use well

17:58.158 --> 18:01.061
We did not have a paddle that summer. It was in the 
fall that I had my first experience with it. There

18:07.808 --> 18:17.539
was a lot of

18:07.808 --> 18:17.539
monitoring, I guess, since this was a new program. 
And what courses did you take? Do you remember? I

18:20.082 --> 18:25.127
took chemistry. in organic chemistry, English.

18:39.908 --> 18:41.209
That's already a tough load.

18:44.152 --> 18:46.654
You had had chemistry in high school? Yeah, those 
were the two courses. You'd had chemistry in high

18:50.077 --> 18:51.479
school? No. Oh, you had not? No. What was it like 
then? really, really scary. And this was my first

19:00.057 --> 19:20.462
experience, and I'm not saying this to sound 
bragging or anything, but especially when I was

19:00.057 --> 19:20.462
going to school at Robie, I just didn't study. It 
wasn't necessary. And I made, you know, Pretty

19:26.093 --> 19:27.776
good grades, good grades. But of course I came to 
A&M on probation because that was a little school

19:28.757 --> 19:38.332
that I didn't take enough acceptable courses for 
full admission to A&M. And yet here I was

19:40.335 --> 19:50.531
confronted with something and it was, for the 
first couple weeks, it was just an out of control

19:40.335 --> 19:50.531
situation. I'd never experienced that before. Do 
you remember who the chemistry teacher was? Oh,

19:55.777 --> 19:57.840
yeah. Well, I can't remember his name. Wasn't one 
of the legendary, John Beckham or somebody like

20:01.104 --> 20:05.450
that? No. This was a man who

20:06.891 --> 20:13.640
died during our freshman year. He was killed in a 
boating accident, as I remember. Seemed like he

20:17.565 --> 20:19.087
was involved. He was doing research with the 
oceanography group. You were here all summer?

20:24.667 --> 20:25.528
Yeah. About how many students were? Well, there 
were two Air Force squadrons in dorm 14, and there

20:29.373 --> 20:40.307
were two companies, infantry companies. Well, 
one infantry and one artillery, I believe. As you

20:45.134 --> 20:46.856
remember them? Of course, there were many, many, 
many, sophomores and other upperclassmen, but

20:53.641 --> 20:58.766
especially sophomores. See, at that particular 
time, there were two types of people that went to

20:59.306 --> 21:07.193
summer school at A&M. There were students who 
flunked a course or one or more courses and had to

21:09.195 --> 21:15.901
make up the slack.

21:19.084 --> 21:23.648
Or they were graduate students who were here a lot 
of you know right graduate students teachers and

21:24.387 --> 21:52.251
that type of people and they were living in a remote 
location to us they were just in another world as

21:24.387 --> 21:52.251
far as i knew at that time

21:24.387 --> 21:52.251
but there were so many sophomores as as you recall 
describe the routine of a day what time did y'all

21:24.387 --> 21:52.251
get up what did you do how long were classes

21:56.585 --> 21:59.309
Did you have Reveille and fallout and all that? 
Yeah, we fell out. I can't remember. I think we fell

22:03.536 --> 22:05.679
out at 7. No, it wasn't because we started classes. 
We had 7 o'clock classes. So we fell out at 6.

22:12.629 --> 22:15.714
Because that beat the heat to have the 7 o'clock 
class. And we really needed it because there were

22:17.597 --> 22:20.922
no air-conditioned classes. that time. And the 
classes lasted about how long? I think they lasted

22:25.410 --> 22:30.498
an hour and a half hour and 15 minutes for an hour and 
a half. Then you had chemistry lab every day? No

22:34.104 --> 22:48.647
I think it was three days two

22:34.104 --> 22:48.647
three days a week and then one afternoon was ROTC 
was drill

22:51.361 --> 23:00.509
And we had a PE class

22:51.361 --> 23:00.509
and

22:51.361 --> 23:00.509
ROTC. Those were the things, the classes that we 
attended. And these two Air Force companies, were

23:04.713 --> 23:10.198
most of them fish? Yeah. All of the people, all of 
the members of each of the squadrons and companies

23:13.021 --> 23:19.427
were freshmen. except for a CO and an executive 
officer, two seniors and two juniors. Yeah, so you

23:28.268 --> 23:37.942
all didn't have the task that you would have in the 
fall of cleaning up an upperclassman's room every

23:28.268 --> 23:37.942
morning. You didn't have to do that. No. But in the 
dining hall, did you all have the same kind of

23:41.467 --> 23:47.475
routine that summer that would be in the fall? 
Yeah, uh-huh. And

23:50.002 --> 24:02.944
we were exposed to various things, items of 
foolishness associated with the dining hall.

24:03.325 --> 24:07.993
There was one of the juniors who convened an order 
of the green dragon i guess and he'd do all sorts of

24:08.918 --> 24:37.575
foolish things i mean it was it was just a shirt 
something to to uh make the freshmen do foolish

24:08.918 --> 24:37.575
things such as uh oh you'd have to he would uh when he 
would convene this and it it didn't involve the

24:08.918 --> 24:37.575
same people but uh when he would convene the Order 
of the Green Dragon, he'd borrow one of the

24:38.787 --> 25:00.289
waiter's trays, and he would just come up to a table 
with the freshmen still there, and at the freshmen

24:38.787 --> 25:00.289
table, you know, there are 10 tables would seat 10 
people, and so we would have all eight freshmen,

25:01.028 --> 25:05.854
typically there'd be eight freshmen on the table. 
And then if there were upperclassmen sitting,

25:05.934 --> 25:11.941
well, there'd be at least one upperclassman at one 
end or the other. And often there'd be two

25:12.041 --> 25:16.206
upperclassmen, one at each end. But we thought it 
was pretty bad, all the things we had to go through

25:16.987 --> 25:26.018
it that summer. But really, it wasn't that bad 
because we didn't have sophomores in the picture.

25:30.948 --> 25:59.487
sitting with us because we did see the the 
upperclassmen they were going to summer school

25:30.948 --> 25:59.487
ate some in another part of Sabisa

25:30.948 --> 25:59.487
but this guy is our I can't remember his name for 
sure I can see his face but he would come in he would

25:30.948 --> 25:59.487
come to your table and he would bong so many times on 
the on the metal tray the big aluminum tray and

25:59.787 --> 26:11.844
convene the Order of the Green Dragon and he would 
point to this one or that one and to go over and he'd

25:59.787 --> 26:11.844
give you a table to go sing something, you know.

26:14.789 --> 26:15.610
So nothing bad? No, it was the main thing was just I 
guess he enjoyed seeing how people would how you

26:27.057 --> 26:50.297
know a function under in the embarrassed so you're 
in chemistry and english class just about all

26:27.057 --> 26:50.297
morning then lab or rotc most of the afternoon then 
at night were you back in your room studying and so

26:27.057 --> 26:50.297
how did uh how did the summer go in terms of uh 
academically for you well you mean the grades yeah

26:51.863 --> 27:21.718
you did okay i did all right but i started i went into 
the hole in chemistry pretty to begin with but then

26:51.863 --> 27:21.718
i i had a couple of of uh freshmen around me who had 
had found chemistry to be easy in high school and

26:51.863 --> 27:21.718
they hardly studied made a point of it in fact one of 
them jimmy smith i remember him quite well because

26:51.863 --> 27:21.718
we were of buddied up and he he really helped me out 
with chemistry but he kind of made a show of the fact

27:22.559 --> 27:42.897
that he he knew this chemistry no problem and he 
would he didn't study much well we both made bees I

27:43.889 --> 27:50.298
made B the first semester, the first six weeks to 
take. So you pulled out of that hole quickly. Well,

27:55.365 --> 28:04.818
we just finished the one semester of the first 
semester. Isn't that the way? No, I guess we took

28:10.245 --> 28:12.208
both semesters.

28:19.006 --> 28:21.889
I should have thought about that a little bit. And 
compared to high school, the English course, was

28:22.370 --> 28:25.993
it a demanding course? Yeah, English was 
something that I made light of, I guess, in high

28:27.215 --> 28:35.323
school. And so

28:37.045 --> 28:48.237
I made B's in 103 and 104 here,

28:37.045 --> 28:48.237
but it was a struggle. Right, then... Mainly 
because of time. You know, in writing a theme, you

28:52.435 --> 28:58.883
had about enough time for one shot at it. Not much 
polished time or anything else. And what did

29:05.112 --> 29:13.343
you... Fred Eckfeldt was my English teacher, and 
that was really a blessing. I didn't realize it at

29:13.463 --> 29:15.386
the time. Describe him as a teacher. Uh... Very 
proper. Of course, you know him, not a tall man, but

29:21.886 --> 29:34.978
very stately in his carriage and demeanor. He was 
not,

29:37.500 --> 29:42.104
well.

29:48.389 --> 29:49.510
What made him a good teacher?

29:52.662 --> 30:20.087
I think his thoroughness in the fact that he 
wouldn't he wouldn't allow you to

29:52.662 --> 30:20.087
I just remember being him holding me holding me and 
then seeing him hold others to kind of their feet to

29:52.662 --> 30:20.087
the fire to give a give a reasonable answer he 
wouldn't just accept a whip or something like that

30:20.489 --> 30:28.397
And yet he didn't do this in a way that you felt put 
upon or, I mean, he left you with your dignity,

30:20.489 --> 30:28.397
totally.

30:32.621 --> 30:45.855
But he was a good role model to me in that

30:32.621 --> 30:45.855
he conveyed, imparted to me the fact that he 
considered the business of writing and of

30:46.460 --> 30:50.267
composition to be important. And you're working 
hard during these weeks and you're, did you go home

30:51.549 --> 31:00.486
in midsummer or just stayed here? I had two trips 
that I can remember. in the summer, and those were

31:05.545 --> 31:08.052
weekend trips. I went home with, went to Baytown to 
the home of a twin, a couple of boys that were here

31:08.132 --> 31:19.622
that I had made friends with, the Banta brothers.
