WEBVTT

00:03.727 --> 00:05.649
Okay. I was just saying, did we see any basic 
changes or anything like that? No, like I said,

00:12.495 --> 00:24.006
we're pretty well on an equal scholastic level, 
and those things have sort of been weeded out of our

00:12.495 --> 00:24.006
inputs. Now, we do have one basic problem around 
here. What's that? And that's Aggies and T-Cyps.

00:33.562 --> 00:36.866
Aggies are definitely inferior, according to 
TCIP's.

00:40.830 --> 00:47.277
Are the majority of NASA employees here in the 
military, or are they civilian? They're all

00:47.297 --> 00:49.900
civilian. Has that changed since NASA first began 
in the past? It seemed like all the astronauts were

00:53.503 --> 01:02.353
mainly in the military, and all you ever saw were 
people with the crew cuts and everything. Has that

01:02.840 --> 01:03.661
changed? Must be talking about Gene Kranz.

01:09.630 --> 01:15.298
Let me tell you first that I've always had military 
detailees working for me. They were in the PASS

01:15.318 --> 01:18.322
programs for many, many years. And there was, as 
far as I know, in terms of pay, they were paid by the

01:19.384 --> 01:30.400
military, but it was here for training to learn 
orbital mechanics and different flight mechanic

01:31.190 --> 01:34.353
skills and how you actually operate in space. And 
they used, they donated time, they donated time to

01:35.294 --> 01:42.101
the individual, and we went through a training 
process with them. And of course, we were able to

01:42.961 --> 01:45.464
use them in a productive manner. As we moved in more 
into the military, also getting more, being more

01:47.085 --> 01:59.037
dependent on the orbiter as a launch vehicle, they 
have more people here. They've elected right now

02:00.502 --> 02:18.408
in order to save money and instead of having their 
own launch facility and duplication of control

02:00.502 --> 02:18.408
facilities, et cetera, to co-locate here with us 
and do all the operations out of the control

02:00.502 --> 02:18.408
center, which makes a lot of sense because it does 
save a lot of taxpayer dollars. And instead of

02:19.329 --> 02:24.797
going over and duplicating the whole operation, 
that you only use those parts that you need. So in

02:24.817 --> 02:28.602
that case, there is a more than military they're 
only working on their pangolins, on their

02:28.868 --> 02:34.714
flights. Is there any tension between the two 
groups? Not

02:38.278 --> 02:42.762
as bad as the Angus and the T-6. No, they're very 
well accepted in both ways, and they work quite

02:44.564 --> 02:53.013
well together. Since you've been at NASA, what 
changes have taken place as far as our goals in

02:53.033 --> 02:57.137
space?

03:01.994 --> 03:02.915
That's a good question. I think basically the 
first emphasis was to, it was a national pride.

03:09.783 --> 03:17.212
There was a lot of things being lost in terms of 
prestige amongst the other countries around the

03:09.783 --> 03:17.212
world. And actually, the technology is one of the 
best things we've got to sell to the rest of the

03:17.312 --> 03:22.779
world. And you always got to give a country or any 
individual, treat a country the same as you would

03:30.715 --> 03:32.857
an individual. You always gotta set goals and 
objectives above what one can achieve, or make

03:33.838 --> 03:46.973
them high, at least, so he will strive to meet those 
requirements. And in the process of doing that,

03:47.033 --> 03:58.866
there's a lot of spinoff of good products, and the 
things that we're enjoying today in the

03:47.033 --> 03:58.866
commercial world is a lot of that is spent on some of 
the things we paid them, the taxpayer money is paid

03:59.740 --> 04:06.746
for the R&D development of it. And the process of 
doing all that told the national pride in our, in

04:08.148 --> 04:20.178
how we looked, and that's a product, that's one of 
the best products in terms of engineering skills

04:08.148 --> 04:20.178
and products. One of the best things we can sell to 
foreign countries, and etc. That's a big

04:24.302 --> 04:27.705
exportable item.

04:28.968 --> 04:41.642
We shifted from

04:28.968 --> 04:41.642
really more or less as a nation trying to be number 
one in space and etc. to a point of where we're

04:41.682 --> 04:55.396
trying to go into more of the commercial world and 
actually sell time in space, work with other

04:41.682 --> 04:55.396
customers. So it was a shift from a a national pride 
type of thing, I think, to now more, hey, I satisfy

04:57.622 --> 05:06.572
the customer internationally, et cetera, who 
wants to fly out in space. Does that make sense?

05:08.734 --> 05:09.455
Yeah. Yeah. So, I mean, we've gone from just 
wanting to be the first in space, or first to do

05:11.557 --> 05:23.170
this, or first to be on the moon in the best, to 
commercialism. Yeah, the old commercialism has

05:24.591 --> 05:27.274
taken over there now, that also has money to be 
made. It doesn't have to be subsidized by the

05:29.878 --> 05:34.502
government. What do you think Russia's steps will 
be? I mean, seeing as how they are a

05:37.225 --> 05:43.692
non-capitalistic nation, what will their steps 
be? Or where are they, you know, where they're

05:44.072 --> 05:49.117
working, what they're working on, what they're 
trying to accomplish? I suspect, I think they're

05:50.559 --> 05:54.983
trying to, I've heard rumors about having a 
getting a larger launch vehicle going to put more

05:55.604 --> 06:00.489
weight into space. I think you'll see them 
probably moving in the morning to maybe larger

06:00.509 --> 06:06.334
space stations.

06:09.877 --> 06:12.680
Well, ours are being used for commercialistic 
reasons. What will theirs, what do you think

06:12.720 --> 06:15.483
theirs will be used for? I think they'll obviously 
be looking at both areas. There's one definitely

06:20.687 --> 06:24.531
militaristic thing that could be used with them. 
But also they're interested in doing commercial

06:25.388 --> 06:38.280
development of various things, so they'll be 
doing a lot of experiments and things like that on

06:25.388 --> 06:38.280
board, and manufacturing and that sort of stuff. 
What are NASA's plans after the show?

06:44.366 --> 06:44.987
After the show?

06:49.631 --> 06:54.636
Well, there's really no such thing as after the 
show.

06:55.595 --> 06:57.677
If you're at the space station, okay. The reason I 
say that, you can look at the, the shuttle's gonna

06:57.697 --> 07:01.600
be around for years. It's gonna be like the 
original. It's gonna be like the DC-3s that's been

07:04.543 --> 07:09.387
flying now for, what, 40 years. Commercial air, 
like 707s, 747s, the planes don't sort of go away.

07:17.534 --> 07:20.857
They just, they keep flying and you get better 
ones. I wouldn't be surprised if you don't see the

07:21.037 --> 07:25.281
basic orbiter flying for another, It was designed 
for 10 years. It'll probably fly for 20 or 30 years

07:28.641 --> 07:32.505
at least. And of course, we're talking about 
upgrading it, making it better. And when we move

07:35.748 --> 07:42.715
into the space station, which is what we're doing 
now, that occupies pretty well for the next 10

07:35.748 --> 07:42.715
years. And then after that, I think we'll see a man. 
There's two moves. There's one talking about

07:47.179 --> 07:52.905
going back to the moon and putting some planetary 
bases there. So pretty wild ideas of things we can

07:53.442 --> 07:57.987
do on the moon in terms of commercial. There's a 
concept that we'll put power generating stations

07:59.209 --> 08:19.433
on the lunar surface that would produce, gather 
the sun's energy and focus it back to the earth and

07:59.209 --> 08:19.433
be able to collect it and provide it for commercial 
use for I was saying, I've heard of numbers where it

08:19.784 --> 08:31.021
would be done as cheap as we can do it now, currently 
here on the Earth, so then that type of development

08:19.784 --> 08:31.021
comes with an endless supply of energy. We just use 
the sun's energy reflected from big reflectors on

08:31.081 --> 08:37.090
the lunar surface. And you're talking about, for 
example there, one concept is you take a bunch of

08:37.130 --> 08:48.407
bulldozers up there and you bulldoze this big 
surface out into reflecting areas. where it

08:48.927 --> 08:53.473
becomes a collector and focuses that energy back 
to the earth.

08:56.356 --> 08:59.280
There's a lot of different groups pushing 
different ways. I suspect we probably see some

09:01.102 --> 09:06.589
in-planetary man, in-planetary exploratory 
activities. And then also maybe a man permanent

09:07.871 --> 09:12.677
presence on the moon. Back to the question about 
women and blacks. the Russians were the first one

09:16.147 --> 09:20.511
to put a woman in orbit, and the first to have a co-ed 
flight. Why, you know, you said that women were

09:22.934 --> 09:27.478
always here employed. Why do you think it took so 
long for them to be put into space here in America?

09:35.045 --> 09:45.175
Well, one can go from the point of trying to find 
somebody who's really qualified to, to stand to

09:35.045 --> 09:45.175
the rigors of doing that activity, and that's That 
has some

09:46.302 --> 09:52.570
semi-merits, might say weak merits probably. One 
of the things that preconditioning for the early

09:53.871 --> 10:06.627
flights was to have somebody who had had a lot of 
training in an aircraft business or military

09:53.871 --> 10:06.627
realistic type training. That was a resource that 
saved a lot of cross training. And that was a simple

10:13.455 --> 10:15.297
resource to draw upon. And then the other thing is 
there's a lot of

10:16.492 --> 10:26.741
accommodations that would have made it 
difficult. It would be a lot more engineering work

10:26.801 --> 10:38.051
to have to do to set the accommodations for women as 
simple as it was for men, like potty

10:26.801 --> 10:38.051
accommodations and that sort of stuff. So,

10:39.032 --> 10:44.997
when you're trying to put together a facility, 
minimize the complications. So I think it's one of

10:49.923 --> 11:00.539
those just to have the right accommodations and 
putting it into the design and working with

10:49.923 --> 11:00.539
getting qualified people. Has that taken a lot of 
adjustment in the shuttle to accommodate it to

11:01.020 --> 11:05.446
work? I don't think so. I think that 
accommodations were sort of built in from

11:07.509 --> 11:12.176
scratch. You know, it was sort of built in. and 
that's different than having to go back in and

11:14.575 --> 11:42.304
redesign, and of course the concept there was that 
it was actually built into the design, and it's, I

11:14.575 --> 11:42.304
think about the original question, one of the 
problems was that we, these selected, NASA

11:14.575 --> 11:42.304
selected to use the military pilots and things as a 
prime source of of astronaut candidates. And...

11:46.588 --> 11:51.013
At that time, women weren't in the military? They 
weren't in the military, but too early. I don't

11:54.077 --> 11:57.281
think you had too many fighter pilots and that sort 
of stuff. And that's basically what they were

11:57.301 --> 12:00.926
looking for. I mean, you could select another 
group of people as a source of people to pick from.

12:11.697 --> 12:14.440
But they just happened to say, hey, let's go to the 
military and use them. So they might have used

12:16.423 --> 12:22.410
truck drivers. Has there been much of an impact 
here at NASA with women here and blacks? Has there

12:28.418 --> 12:29.640
been any prejudices? Not really. No more than, I 
wouldn't say normal, just everybody really It's

12:40.098 --> 12:44.924
more on a technical level, and everybody respects 
you from a technical standpoint. And you usually

12:46.325 --> 12:49.729
don't pull a lot of punches. I have two ladies I'm 
working with now that seem to be tigers.

12:59.821 --> 13:01.563
They definitely don't pull no punches on us. In 
closing, today, the press came out and said that

13:06.608 --> 13:11.514
Soviet leader Konstantin Chernenko died 
yesterday. What type of effect would the death of a

13:11.574 --> 13:21.187
Soviet leader and the question of who will be 
appointed next have on anything, you know, as far

13:11.574 --> 13:21.187
as our scheduling? Does that, are we, do we have to 
reschedule if someone, you know, really

13:21.347 --> 13:30.278
non-American or, you know, down on Americans gets 
appointed? What does something like that do

13:30.739 --> 13:32.481
around here? I don't think it's gonna, we're 
pretty well insulated from that right now, since

13:33.153 --> 13:51.836
we're not really materialistic,

13:33.153 --> 13:51.836
otherwise not involved with the military that 
much at the center, that I don't see this having a

13:33.153 --> 13:51.836
lot to do with how we operate here. They have a 
mental impact. And we're pretty well, I like to

13:57.542 --> 14:01.287
say, pretty well insulated from all that 
activity. and those type of major decisions. Now

14:04.593 --> 14:26.937
if they come out with, but on the other hand if they 
come out and made a major statement that he's going

14:04.593 --> 14:26.937
to put manned, manned a station on the moon or make a 
big push for Mars or something like that, do a

14:04.593 --> 14:26.937
manned landing on Mars, and that was the national 
objective of the Russians, obviously those type

14:04.593 --> 14:26.937
of decisions would definitely affect us. Okay, 
well thank you for your time. Enjoy it. Thank you.
