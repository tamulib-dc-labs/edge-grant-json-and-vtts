00:02.393 --> 00:04.836
Two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight.

00:04.916 --> 00:07.119
Testing, testing, testing.

00:07.139 --> 00:08.881
Testing, testing, testing.

00:10.803 --> 00:23.438
Today is January the 22nd in the Wiener Building and I have the honor and pleasure of interviewing Dr. Sam, or in this would it be Samuel?

00:23.758 --> 00:29.645
Samuel M. Dr. Samuel M. Gillespie, professor of... Marketing.

00:29.725 --> 00:30.426
Marketing.

00:31.030 --> 00:35.155
about his 30-plus years of service here.

00:35.976 --> 00:51.534
To introduce yourself to anyone who might hear this tape or read the transcription, describe young Sam Gillespie, where did he grow up, what did his family do, where did he go to high school and then college, and all of your experience before coming here.

00:51.614 --> 01:00.885
I was born August 9, 1934, in Shelbyville, Illinois, where my father was a high school coach.

01:03.143 --> 01:25.810
My mother at that time was also, I have a sister who was one and a half at that time when I was born, and yet mom also was teaching shorthand and bookkeeping at Sparks Business College there in Shelbyville.

01:26.887 --> 01:40.844
In 1940 my father, excuse me, in 1936 my father got a coaching job at Charleston, Illinois at the high school, home of Eastern Illinois State Teachers College at that time.

01:41.866 --> 01:47.713
We moved there in 1936 and in 1940 he

01:47.693 --> 01:49.277
I stopped coaching.

01:49.678 --> 01:58.461
My sister and I and my family moved to my grandparents on my mother's side to a town called St.

01:58.642 --> 01:59.965
Elmo, E-L-M-O.

02:01.531 --> 02:11.969
about 60 miles, 70 miles west of there in Fayette County where my grandfather owned and operated a Chevrolet dealership.

02:12.529 --> 02:13.371
I grew up in St.

02:13.431 --> 02:20.603
Elmo from 1940 all the way through high school.

02:21.140 --> 02:31.282
Played and did the normal things, Boy Scouts, Eagle Scouts, track, played basketball and football and track, no baseball, since that was not a sport.

02:32.224 --> 02:33.086
Graduated from St.

02:33.106 --> 02:37.596
Elmo High School in 52, went to the University of Illinois.

02:37.576 --> 02:42.303
pledged and became an active in Tal Kappa Epsilon fraternity.

02:43.826 --> 02:57.266
My freshman year I attempted to sing in the men's glee club, but they had me at first tenor and I wasn't a first tenor and it would strain my voice and I couldn't handle that.

02:57.306 --> 02:59.109
They had enough second tenors apparently.

02:59.970 --> 03:04.377
I also took as my P.E.

03:04.357 --> 03:09.571
wrestling and won at my weight the university level competition.

03:09.611 --> 03:19.497
And the wrestling coach asked me to come out and participate in the following semester, which I did, and the following fall I did.

03:19.477 --> 03:26.045
But I was, couldn't, couldn't compete at the level, the kids out of Chicago, so that was short-lived.

03:27.247 --> 03:37.079
I majored in what we called the College of Commerce and Business Administration and degree in marketing.

03:38.341 --> 03:41.164
Met my wife in February of 54.

03:41.819 --> 03:52.168
My wife, Pat Johnson at that time, Pat grew up in a Swedish community in western Illinois, a town called Monmouth, or on a farm south of Monmouth.

03:52.469 --> 03:56.841
Monmouth had its own college there, Monmouth College, where I think the

03:56.821 --> 04:05.456
Pi Beta Phi's began, I think the Thetas may have begun there, back in the turn of the century.

04:06.859 --> 04:17.237
And she was a cheerleader and homecoming queen and all the things, and raised cattle for competition at the fair.

04:17.277 --> 04:20.803
And I met her through my

04:20.783 --> 04:24.128
roommate who was engaged to Pat's roommate.

04:25.830 --> 04:32.419
From there we began dating and we married in the summer of 55.

04:32.499 --> 04:38.187
She graduated with a degree in sociology and I continued on for the next year.

04:38.247 --> 04:47.280
Graduated in spring of 56 and had my first job with Sears Roebuck and Company in Dubuque, Iowa.

04:49.285 --> 04:50.667
stayed in Dubuque, Iowa.

04:50.988 --> 04:56.897
One of our sons, our first son, Samuel Arvind, and the Arvinds after Pat's father, Arvind Johnson.

04:59.502 --> 05:00.824
Sam was born there in 59.

05:02.687 --> 05:13.084
My parents wanted me to come back and run a furniture store my mother had started in the early 50s, wanted me to run it, and I said I would.

05:13.144 --> 05:15.748
So we packed up and moved back to southern Illinois.

05:16.589 --> 05:19.695
And I ran that operation until 63.

05:20.016 --> 05:28.734
And my business was getting very good and growing, but more and more my business was coming from out of the community.

05:28.754 --> 05:30.317
It was a town of 1200 in St.

05:30.338 --> 05:31.560
Elmo was.

05:31.979 --> 05:47.334
I noticed that a larger share of the business was coming out of other communities, and so I bought a property over in the county seat called Vandalia, second capital, state capital for the state of Illinois at that time until Mr. Lincoln moved it to Springfield.

05:48.855 --> 06:01.007
And bought a piece of property and was going one day going over to sign the papers and came to the bluff of the Kaskaskia River and headed down the bluff and said, man, I'm going to be in debt a long time.

06:02.287 --> 06:05.392
Stopped the car, turned around, came back and said, we're going to sell the business.

06:05.592 --> 06:07.395
And Pat asked what I was going to do.

06:07.415 --> 06:11.761
And I said, I don't know, but I didn't think I wanted to spend the rest of my life there in St.

06:11.781 --> 06:12.021
Elmo.

06:12.041 --> 06:13.343
And my wife said, amen.

06:14.445 --> 06:22.056
And by that time, we had a second child born in the hospital in Fayette County there, David.

06:22.477 --> 06:23.839
David was born in 60.

06:23.819 --> 06:30.009
So we sold the business and had a grand sale and made a lot of money going out of business.

06:30.069 --> 06:37.141
I've always said there's two ways to make a lot of money in the furniture store and that's to have a grand opening and a going out of business sale.

06:37.381 --> 06:42.570
So we took our profits and moved to Champaign, Illinois where I

06:43.310 --> 07:05.622
It must have looked pretty nice to the department head and he let me start the master's program and from there it's kind of history because I enjoyed what I was doing, enjoyed getting in the library, enjoyed getting my hands dirty, enjoyed reading and enjoyed all aspects, I guess, of university life.

07:06.412 --> 07:19.744
kind of drugged my feet on the masters, hadn't got my masters completed except for the, we had to do thesis in those times and didn't have the thesis completed but said I wanted to go on for the PhD and they said fine and finally completed the thesis.

07:21.105 --> 07:32.294
Somewhere along in 65 or 66, I began to do some teaching and then an opening came for the assistant dean.

07:32.314 --> 07:36.418
We had a turnover of deans, Paul Green, one of the deans retired,

07:36.398 --> 08:02.592
An interim, another dean, Joe McCarthy, John, Joe, well, Joe McCarthy, but it's not the same Joe McCarthy we know of, I guess, but came and stayed a short while and was disenchanted with the community and left, and an interim dean by the name of Vern Zimmerman stepped in as associate dean, and I helped him run the undergraduate program, and it was there.

08:02.572 --> 08:17.511
Part of my job was if Vern was tied up, I would take some of the visitors, meet them at the airport, bring them in, take them out to dinner, chat with them, so that they might not be alone that evening.

08:17.531 --> 08:24.259
So one time Vern said, there's a gentleman coming from Texas A&M up to interview some people from accounting.

08:25.808 --> 08:29.852
that were finishing a PhD in accounting, and he was up here, and I think his name was Jack Coleman.

08:29.952 --> 08:38.201
I think Coleman was the head of the accounting department, and this was in, must have been in early 67, late 66, early 67.

08:40.924 --> 08:45.428
And I met Jack at the airport, took him to the Urbana Lincoln Hotel.

08:45.489 --> 08:52.656
We had a toddy or two, and then the next day he visited with Vern, and I took him back to the airport.

08:53.757 --> 08:55.579
Maybe I had lunch with him, I can't recall.

08:56.116 --> 08:56.997
and said goodbye.

08:57.077 --> 09:14.002
I was finishing up my work all but ABD and so I was looking around and I guess I had shared with Jack that I was looking around and I had interviewed at Georgia and at Memphis State and South Carolina.

09:14.443 --> 09:25.920
Patty and I and I all wanted to come south and at VPI at Blacksburg and had an offer from Georgia and Jack

09:27.352 --> 09:30.824
Sent me a letter, said, you're looking around, why don't you take a look at A&M?

09:30.884 --> 09:35.520
And I, gosh, I didn't know too much about A&M at all, very little.

09:35.962 --> 09:37.547
And I said, well, why not?

09:38.624 --> 09:42.629
I came down here and left in a snowstorm and got down here.

09:42.649 --> 09:51.381
It was nice and sunny today, about like today in the 50s, bright sky, bright Texas sun, and I met with Jim McNeil.

09:52.843 --> 10:01.695
I met with John Pearson and some of the other people, and a little bit later,

10:02.384 --> 10:06.790
There was an Allied Social Sciences meeting in Washington, D.C.

10:06.890 --> 10:08.032
Illinois was going to be at it.

10:09.134 --> 10:18.167
Texas A&M and other schools were going to be at it, and so when I got there, John Pearson was there and Bill Eccles, who ran the executive development program, was there.

10:20.450 --> 10:23.895
Who was the head of the management department?

10:25.938 --> 10:27.540
Military guy?

10:27.560 --> 10:31.125
Oh, well, he was there as well, and I'll think of the name.

10:31.105 --> 10:32.868
names wasn't there.

10:33.549 --> 10:39.718
I'm not sure whether Clint Phillips was at that meeting or not, but there were several people there.

10:40.459 --> 10:41.260
What year is this?

10:41.280 --> 10:50.413
This was in December of 66 or January of 67.

10:52.283 --> 10:59.394
I returned and had an offer from John Pearson.

11:00.515 --> 11:02.398
And like I said, I'd accepted a job.

11:02.418 --> 11:03.279
Not accepted.

11:03.620 --> 11:05.763
I had an offer from Georgia.

11:06.424 --> 11:11.632
So I called Jim McNeil, knowing that he'd been in Georgia the year before or two years before.

11:12.473 --> 11:18.983
I said, Jim, I just wanted to call you and tell you that I'm going to accept the job at the University of Georgia.

11:21.680 --> 11:25.243
But now that I have, tell me why you left Georgia.

11:26.185 --> 11:53.104
and uh takes Jim a long while to get words out and it was a long conversation I've learned that you don't want to go into his office because it'd be a long time getting out but uh the upshot of it was that uh after Jim finished talking I went back to Pat and kind of struggled with it and and I called Georgia and said I wasn't coming and called Jim and said that I was and and so I had an offer

11:53.084 --> 11:55.066
I was making $9,000.

11:55.146 --> 12:01.794
I was making $1,000 a month or $9,000 on nine months at Illinois in my job as dean.

12:03.596 --> 12:06.399
I think $9,000 on 12 months because it was an administrative job.

12:07.580 --> 12:13.927
This job paid, I was offered $12,000 and it was not the best offer dollar and cents wise.

12:13.967 --> 12:18.332
In fact, it was the third lowest offer that I had.

12:18.818 --> 12:26.588
And I was getting $12,000 for nine months with the opportunity to perhaps teach in the summer and get outside money.

12:26.648 --> 12:44.252
So, gosh, that looks pretty good for a kid who at one time in his life probably might have sold his soul to Satan because I recall saying, if I could ever make $10,000 a year, guaranteed to make $10,000 a year the rest of my life, I would take that job.

12:44.907 --> 12:53.958
Because I was making $400 a month about there in the furniture business, and we were saving money at $400 a month in this little town.

12:53.998 --> 12:59.825
So, you know, now you're making $1,000 a month, or $12,000 for nine months.

13:00.165 --> 13:02.048
I mean, it's pretty high on the hog.

13:02.849 --> 13:09.397
As you look back, what were the real reasons that caused you to accept the A&M offer?

13:11.019 --> 13:12.180
The real reasons?

13:13.595 --> 13:14.396
I don't know.

13:14.456 --> 13:16.739
Part of it was the adventure of it.

13:18.440 --> 13:24.928
Was there any impression you received of the institution when you came that was an important factor?

13:24.988 --> 13:25.969
No, no.

13:25.989 --> 13:27.631
Well, no, no.

13:27.651 --> 13:28.552
I liked the community.

13:28.912 --> 13:42.808
Ronnie Hale, as soon as he knew that I was coming, Ronnie Hale got on the horn, and Travis Engelbrick, I think Travis got on the horn, but no, it was just good people, good people.

13:42.788 --> 13:55.921
And I guess kind of looking at the opportunity, I was aware that they had just named, just the fall that I came, the fall of 68 was the first, was when the College of Business began.

13:55.961 --> 14:04.149
Maybe there was an empty barrel out there in a sense and I had an opportunity to help fill the barrel.

14:06.351 --> 14:10.535
Describe physically, describe the move of you and your family down here.

14:10.976 --> 14:12.137
Oh, that was an adventure.

14:14.345 --> 14:20.473
Keep in mind, people raised in the Depression don't like to spend a lot of money.

14:20.858 --> 14:28.527
And even though my parents were relatively wealthy, there was something about me that I just was kind of tight.

14:28.608 --> 14:36.397
So when we moved from Champaign to Dubuque, I got John Stein to move me.

14:38.500 --> 14:40.422
When I moved from Dubuque back down to St.

14:40.442 --> 14:42.084
Elmo, I had John Stein move me.

14:42.124 --> 14:44.487
Now, you know, that's $200.

14:44.872 --> 14:52.384
Old cattle truck, get up there, help him load it, and follow John home, or send him six hours ahead of us, and we take off, and we meet him about wherever.

14:53.326 --> 15:02.881
I had a friend who was a farmer over in a little town called Greymont, Illinois, north of Bloomington, and we'd go pheasant hunting up there.

15:02.941 --> 15:11.014
And so Paul Forney, I talked to Paul, and he says, you know, I go down and get some bulls down around Brenham.

15:12.125 --> 15:18.514
Why don't I just take a bigger truck and we'll load you up and we'll take you down there.

15:18.955 --> 15:20.037
Well, how much did you take me down there?

15:21.198 --> 15:22.801
I don't know, three or four hundred dollars.

15:23.722 --> 15:35.299
So Paul came down with another guy and Patty and I meticulously had loaded everything and we sat out there and Paul pulled up in his truck and he bought the smaller truck.

15:36.821 --> 15:37.963
And this was a Sunday.

15:39.614 --> 15:46.502
And so we loaded as much as we could on that cattle truck and we looked around town for a U-Haul and finally hauled somebody out.

15:47.103 --> 15:54.152
Put a hitching rack on this old Chevy two station wagon that I had, a 1963 Chevy two station wagon, had a lot of miles but at that time.

15:56.174 --> 16:00.880
And put a U-Haul on the back of that and that station wagon had no air conditioning.

16:03.712 --> 16:09.300
And we got everything packed and we left Champaign about 11 o'clock at night.

16:09.360 --> 16:15.489
We called ahead to where Pat's brother lived out in Frontenac and west suburbs of St.

16:15.529 --> 16:15.949
Louis.

16:16.170 --> 16:18.713
And it was kind of a contrast really here.

16:18.934 --> 16:19.835
Here were these kids.

16:19.855 --> 16:30.630
I mean these windows rolled down in late July, August, nowhere in condition, pulling this U-Haul trailer in a Chevy 2 station wagon that had a dented inside.

16:31.302 --> 16:37.252
Might have had a hubcap gone, pulling into west suburb of St.

16:37.272 --> 16:41.660
Louis, where a past brother was president of Carter Carburetor and lived in pretty high style.

16:42.581 --> 16:46.408
And here were these Squatleys pulling in.

16:46.388 --> 16:51.273
there at night, and we stayed there all night and took off early in the morning and headed to Texas.

16:51.954 --> 17:10.354
I don't know where we stayed all night, can't remember that, but I do know we came driving down Highway 6 on 79 through Franklin and then came on in to Hearn, turned south there at Hearn, and that's not a real appetizing drive.

17:10.334 --> 17:30.259
from, uh, from Franklin into there and of course we just kind of looked at it and shut our eyes and drove on and pulled in here and, uh, and we bought a home from, uh, that Ernie Sims had built in 64 and, uh, uh, back up, need to back up just a little bit.

17:30.319 --> 17:36.087
We'd come down in, uh, in June of 68, Patty and I, to look at College Station.

17:36.107 --> 17:39.531
Ronnie Hale and Travis Engelbrecht were trying to get our, our, uh,

17:40.422 --> 17:41.344
real estate business.

17:41.966 --> 17:50.348
And we were taken around by Bessie Lou Barron, I wanna think that's her name, Bessie Lou Barron, real estate guy.

17:51.307 --> 18:00.080
And we were looking at houses, and we thought we could afford probably something that was in the neighborhood of $16,000 or $17,000.

18:00.140 --> 18:05.708
That's about where we figured we could, because we didn't have much money.

18:06.469 --> 18:07.791
We'd worn out everything.

18:07.891 --> 18:09.293
The washing machine was worn out.

18:09.353 --> 18:11.036
The dryer was worn out.

18:11.376 --> 18:12.398
Our clothes were worn out.

18:12.458 --> 18:13.680
The car was worn out.

18:14.541 --> 18:16.524
We pretty much used up all our assets.

18:16.644 --> 18:18.647
The only thing we had was on the come.

18:19.640 --> 18:28.954
And so I'd put an ad in the Brian paper that a young professor from the University of Illinois was looking for a home to buy.

18:30.777 --> 18:41.513
So I got a note from Jean Marie Anderson and Wally Anderson about their homes.

18:41.695 --> 19:04.834
weren't going to put it on the market hadn't even put it in the classified but saw my ad so we called down and got an appointment to meet them Bessie Lou took us around town and we gosh she sold some houses you know that were you know thirty thousand dollars or thirty two thousand dollars and and we just there was no way we could afford that and Bessie Lou would have said honey

19:04.814 --> 19:08.139
Honey, those bankers just dying to loan you money.

19:08.600 --> 19:10.122
Absolutely dying to loan you.

19:10.162 --> 19:11.864
You work at the University.

19:11.885 --> 19:14.168
You're the best credit there is out there.

19:16.231 --> 19:29.691
So we drove up in front of the house we now lived in for the last 33 years and drove up in front of there and we looked at that and we said, man there's no way we can afford that house.

19:31.493 --> 19:34.537
And we said, well, gosh, we've already got this apartment and we must go in.

19:35.818 --> 19:41.144
Jean Marie met us at the door, and she showed us around the house, and gosh, we really liked the house.

19:41.204 --> 19:45.229
And she says, I said, how much is the house?

19:45.269 --> 19:47.692
And she says, it's $26,500.

19:48.553 --> 19:53.198
But the real, you'll have to ask my husband Wally what the real price is.

19:54.832 --> 19:58.558
And Patty and I had left, and I said, well, I don't know.

19:59.059 --> 19:59.700
I sure like it.

20:00.942 --> 20:01.443
Didn't know.

20:02.825 --> 20:10.918
So we, next day, we see Wally, and he introduced himself, went down to Lily Dairy, where he worked at Lily Dairy.

20:10.958 --> 20:14.363
I guess it was on his wife's side, because she was an edge.

20:15.765 --> 20:20.012
And Wally says, well, my wife mispriced the house to you.

20:21.865 --> 20:23.708
I said, oh my.

20:23.728 --> 20:26.071
She priced you at $26.5 or $26.8.

20:26.151 --> 20:27.193
And I said, that's right.

20:27.213 --> 20:28.635
And she says, well, that's not the price.

20:28.655 --> 20:31.519
It's $25.2 or $25.3 or something like that.

20:32.680 --> 20:36.606
So we bought the house and we split the closing cost.

20:36.826 --> 20:40.411
We walked across the street to Lawrence Title.

20:41.954 --> 20:43.977
And the closing cost was $120.

20:44.878 --> 20:46.460
So I wrote a check for 60.

20:46.520 --> 20:47.822
Oh, I had to have a down payment.

20:48.916 --> 21:04.377
Wally loaned me $2,000 had to have $4,500 Wally loaned me $2,000 and Ronnie Hale, Marshall Peters and them loaned me $2,500 so I had I had borrowed $4,500

21:04.897 --> 21:10.383
And I wrote a check for $60 and I moved into my house on 4100 Tanglewood and I've lived there ever since.

21:11.764 --> 21:14.988
That makes you feel good when bankers like that treat you that way.

21:15.388 --> 21:17.611
Now that's the summer of 68.

21:18.332 --> 21:22.236
And what was the weather like?

21:22.296 --> 21:23.617
The weather was hot.

21:24.258 --> 21:29.704
And when you come into town with a car with no air conditioning, you remember that.

21:29.764 --> 21:34.549
But by the way, I kept that car until 1975.

21:35.018 --> 21:40.825
We finally got a car in 72, 1972 I believe, or 73.

21:41.325 --> 21:43.728
We got a used car off of Charles Broach.

21:43.788 --> 21:53.199
He was a national car rental there at the corner of, at that time it was the corner of Texas Avenue and the University.

21:53.239 --> 21:56.943
But Charlie Broach had a car there and I bought one of his cars used.

21:58.625 --> 22:02.950
And so I went from 68 to 72 driving a car with no air conditioning.

22:03.453 --> 22:08.716
All right, then you can't describe coming out here to the campus and becoming a member of the department.

22:08.937 --> 22:13.176
Well, the department, if you wanted to call it a department, there were five of us.

22:13.696 --> 22:21.685
Uh, those five, Jim McNeil had one secretary, and I forget her name, Elizabeth or Catherine, but anyway, but had one secretary.

22:22.565 --> 22:26.910
Everything was done on a little ditto paper.

22:27.591 --> 22:31.235
I think that's what they call it, a ditto paper, and all the tests and exams.

22:32.396 --> 22:36.480
And, uh, uh, Herb Thompson was here.

22:37.201 --> 22:40.024
He'd been, Herb had come in 51.

22:40.004 --> 22:47.297
Barbara Davis later married Barbara and became Barbara Cole, but Barbara was here.

22:47.357 --> 22:49.040
I'd come the year before from Northwestern.

22:51.004 --> 22:55.592
There was a guy by the name of Jerry, and I want to say Reeves, but that's not right.

22:55.652 --> 22:56.934
It was Jerry Reynolds or somebody.

22:56.954 --> 23:01.202
He was a lecturer, and I was the fifth one.

23:01.182 --> 23:08.691
So there was Jim McNeil, Herb Thompson, Barbara Davis, this Jerry, and myself.

23:08.711 --> 23:09.292
And that was the department.

23:09.312 --> 23:10.373
And who was the department head?

23:10.734 --> 23:11.575
Jim McNeil.

23:11.595 --> 23:13.437
And Jim had come the year before in 67.

23:13.577 --> 23:18.063
And Jim retired, stayed until last year and retired after this.

23:19.124 --> 23:21.147
And the dean, of course, was John Pearson.

23:21.187 --> 23:28.776
Describe him in those early months.

23:30.072 --> 23:33.526
You know, I guess I don't know how to describe him.

23:33.767 --> 23:34.730
John's pretty laid back.

23:35.915 --> 23:40.453
Could be quite serious when it came to be serious.

23:41.513 --> 23:45.879
But I think he tried to treat us as family, really looked at us as family.

23:45.979 --> 23:48.903
We were a small college, a lot of new people.

23:49.604 --> 23:53.509
And the word college was then used for business.

23:53.870 --> 23:54.691
It had been a school.

23:54.771 --> 23:56.193
It had been a school or division.

23:56.453 --> 23:58.016
But it was then a college.

23:58.156 --> 24:00.679
And Leland, I think, was that his name?

24:00.799 --> 24:04.264
I never met the gentleman who was the director of that and John came over.

24:04.244 --> 24:06.887
and took over that position.

24:06.988 --> 24:13.016
What was your impression of John's capability as a leader for the future?

24:13.696 --> 24:17.161
Oh, at the time, I think it was adequate.

24:17.521 --> 24:20.245
I think there was a time where John grew out.

24:20.265 --> 24:21.787
No, no, I was meaning that first.

24:22.047 --> 24:24.270
Oh, I think John, yeah, I was John.

24:24.931 --> 24:27.855
And he was all, in fact, as I look back,

24:28.460 --> 24:32.345
I might have been one of his favorites because I seem to get all the nice things.

24:32.425 --> 24:40.555
I remember Haskell for the Centennial Committee, those are years later, but John could have picked somebody else but he picked me and I got to be on that.

24:41.235 --> 24:45.020
If there was something to be done, somehow I got to be over on some other committee.

24:45.561 --> 24:50.687
I got a lot of kudos off of that.

24:50.987 --> 24:53.370
And where were you all quartered?

24:53.603 --> 24:55.986
We were quartered in Francis Hall.

24:57.248 --> 25:09.723
And my first office was with a gentleman who has since deceased was a young man by the name of Page, Bob Page.

25:10.824 --> 25:12.867
Bob is a good old strong Baptist boy.

25:12.887 --> 25:15.330
I think he left out of three or four years and went up to Baylor.

25:16.491 --> 25:19.375
But Bob and I were literally, I think, in a broom closet.

25:19.861 --> 25:22.586
A big broom closet, but it was long and narrow.

25:23.427 --> 25:30.620
And John had a philosophy that you've got to suffer if you want to have improvement.

25:30.640 --> 25:32.222
And he said you've got to bleed in the streets.

25:33.304 --> 25:39.054
And if you bleed in the streets long enough and show how much anguish you have, maybe you can get somebody's attention.

25:39.114 --> 25:41.278
So he'd cram us all in.

25:41.258 --> 25:45.523
And you'd say, just hold on, hold on, you know, things are going to get better.

25:45.784 --> 25:51.411
Was there anything in the department or the college to introduce you and your wife to the others?

25:52.632 --> 25:53.493
Not that I recall.

25:53.513 --> 25:58.820
I don't, I don't recall that we had a faculty meeting and were introduced.

25:58.840 --> 26:01.684
I think, and we may have, I just don't recall.

26:02.244 --> 26:03.546
But one thing's that we would have.

26:04.207 --> 26:08.312
Now, there were two things that happened every year.

26:08.748 --> 26:12.226
maybe more than that, maybe it was twice a year, but I think just once every year.

26:12.950 --> 26:15.383
First of all, Citizens Bank.

26:16.375 --> 26:29.947
which later became City National Bank, I think when it was Citizens Bank, Marshall Peters Bank, would have, and he may have for other departments, but he'd have a fish fry or a barbecue or something out at the Peters Ranch.

26:30.107 --> 26:31.148
Out in the country.

26:31.168 --> 26:32.650
Out in the country, out off Tabor Road.

26:33.150 --> 26:44.340
And the College of Business would go out there and drink some beer and shoot down some shots and fry some fish and sit there until dark.

26:44.320 --> 26:46.162
and get up and come back.

26:46.202 --> 26:52.448
And that's how you got to know, the bankers got to know you and you got to know the other people and listen to the old timers talk.

26:52.468 --> 27:07.983
Satch was there and Packingham and Dan, I can't remember, helped the assistant dean, I'll think of these names, maybe Dan Long, I think it was Long.

27:09.104 --> 27:11.526
But you got to meet some of those people.

27:11.506 --> 27:18.698
And then the other event that John liked to do was have a get-together, I think it might have been at the end of the semester,

27:19.201 --> 27:46.744
the summer but we'd have a barbecue and and we'd move from place to place as because you'd have to have a bigger place as the faculty grew but one of the places and two of the places i remember we had one was at uh at the old shiloh hall south of town which later became the shiloh cafe and i think rant not randy but uh oh uh the shop putter who was a shop putter here from a&m

27:46.943 --> 27:56.257
Yeah, I think Randy Manson may have owned that Shiloh Hall down there and turned it before he came up and worked.

27:56.277 --> 28:12.242
But in any event, before that ever became anything, we rented that out and get a barbecue, get a briskets or two, and John come down early in the morning, start the fire, and in the afternoon he'd get out his old swab and swab down the briskets and

28:12.222 --> 28:29.859
And John didn't drink but he also, there was plenty of beer and hard liquor there if you wanted to and he'd bring in either a little country band or he'd bring in a DJ and he'd sit there and he could dance and have the best fun and then everybody else I think may have brought a covered dish or something like that.

28:29.979 --> 28:32.965
We also did that up at the American Legion.

28:32.945 --> 28:48.522
Before you began or as you began, did anybody give you any advice, guidelines of how to relate to A&M students?

28:48.583 --> 28:49.704
Did anybody attempt to?

28:49.764 --> 28:50.144
No.

28:50.385 --> 28:52.086
There was no introduction.

28:52.147 --> 28:55.290
There was no orientation.

28:55.270 --> 28:58.718
I can remember some incidences.

28:59.319 --> 29:06.896
At that time, of course, I came in 68, and that's five years after I became co-ed, but there weren't many co-eds out there.

29:06.916 --> 29:08.279
No dormitory yet.

29:08.299 --> 29:10.003
There weren't much room for there.

29:10.103 --> 29:14.393
And I can remember classes, many classes, having all male.

29:14.373 --> 29:29.108
and i can remember that if there were a female they were clearly not more than two or three and as these girls would come into the class for the first day of school or there they would go you'd hear this

29:30.539 --> 29:35.485
It was to suggest to you that you were not really part of them.

29:37.007 --> 29:40.071
That first semester, do you remember what your workload was?

29:40.172 --> 29:41.213
How many courses?

29:41.353 --> 29:44.157
Yeah, I had two preps and two sections.

29:45.679 --> 29:46.580
Two sections of each?

29:46.961 --> 29:47.421
Probably.

29:47.621 --> 29:53.449
I don't think I may have had 12 hours, but they were basic marketing and another class.

29:53.669 --> 29:55.572
Maybe I had nine hours, I don't know.

29:55.752 --> 29:58.015
About how many?

29:59.210 --> 30:06.682
30 to 40 depending on where you were, which course you were teaching in the system.

30:06.702 --> 30:13.233
But I do know one time I went in to teach a course that Jim had me teach.

30:13.253 --> 30:18.081
It was a capstone course, and I've been teaching that class for the last 20 years.

30:19.083 --> 30:19.924
But it was interesting.

30:19.964 --> 30:22.168
I went into that class intimidated.

30:23.691 --> 30:25.774
I really wasn't prepared to teach that class.

30:26.210 --> 30:29.635
I turned around and came to Jim and I said, Jim, I don't think I can teach that class.

30:29.655 --> 30:31.058
And he said, fine, I'll take it over.

30:31.078 --> 30:36.406
And so Jim went in and taught the class and I taught whatever he was teaching and I just felt much better.

30:36.466 --> 30:45.300
And I really appreciated that because I didn't think I was given the textbook that was being used and I don't think I was the one that chose the textbook.

30:45.420 --> 30:47.323
And so I felt bad.

30:47.303 --> 30:59.604
You as a non-Texan, as a Midwesterner, describe how, what your impression was and your feelings about the students at first here.

31:00.846 --> 31:07.077
Well, I just thought, keep in mind, you got to keep my background.

31:07.478 --> 31:10.463
I grew up in southern Illinois and grew up in an oil town.

31:11.464 --> 31:13.007
And those oil, the wells there,
