WEBVTT

00:01.769 --> 00:02.450
You will. Would you tell me a little bit about 
yourself? All right. Well, let's begin with your

00:06.976 --> 00:08.297
name. Clinton A. Phillips. What's the A for? A 
stands for Adam. Okay. My maternal grandfather's

00:16.127 --> 00:20.172
name. Clinton was my father's middle name. 
Anyway, I was born April 10th, Friday, in a little

00:31.115 --> 00:40.747
town called Heaston Furnace, Massachusetts, 
which dates back, has a furnace, a foundry, which

00:31.115 --> 00:40.747
dates back to the Revolutionary War.

00:43.831 --> 00:59.350
But I was only a baby there for maybe six months, and 
my dad then took a position with Ohio Bell

00:43.831 --> 00:59.350
Telephone Company in Cleveland, Ohio, and I grew 
up my early years until I was about six years old in

01:00.072 --> 01:13.130
Cleveland itself, and then into a series of 
suburbs, principally Lakewood, Ohio. I

01:14.412 --> 01:29.893
continued to grow through my school years, 
through junior high, and then moved to North

01:14.412 --> 01:29.893
Olmsted, Ohio, where I was drafted into the 
services, ended up in the What year was that? In

01:31.068 --> 01:52.259
1943 in the U.S. Army Air Corps, where I was enticed

01:31.068 --> 01:52.259
into being an aviation cadet and did indeed go to 
Marietta College for five months, giving me the

01:31.068 --> 01:52.259
year's equivalent of college. Then they decided 
they didn't need any more pilots by the spring of

01:53.340 --> 01:58.868
1944, and I ended first a machine gunner and then 
quickly an instructor and really spent most of the

02:00.232 --> 02:25.402
rest of my military years as a gunnery instructor, 
finally being discharged after serving briefly

02:00.232 --> 02:25.402
as an MP

02:00.232 --> 02:25.402
in Montgomery, Alabama.

02:25.503 --> 02:29.968
Then I returned home and immediately went to 
Baldwin Wallace College. in the summer of 46. And

02:34.821 --> 02:48.074
by the end of August 48, I had finished my four years 
college, counting the Marietta experience.

02:49.575 --> 02:55.721
Almost immediately, within two weeks, I was at 
Vanderbilt University working on a master's

02:49.575 --> 02:55.721
degree. Never,

02:55.781 --> 03:00.546
never wrote a thesis, but and this was in 
economics. Returned then to my home, North

03:03.706 --> 03:17.786
Olmstead, to

03:03.706 --> 03:17.786
be on the faculty of Baldwin Wallace College, my 
bachelor's alma mater, for two years. Then back to

03:18.447 --> 03:23.935
Vanderbilt, where by 1956 I finished a Ph.D. in 
economics.

03:26.227 --> 03:33.056
Whereupon I went to teach at the University of 
Tennessee in the Economics Department for four

03:26.227 --> 03:33.056
years. Then left to join the College of the School 
of Business Administration at Tulane University

03:35.340 --> 03:43.551
in 1958. And were the business colleges just 
getting started about that time, the whole

03:43.912 --> 03:50.040
concept of Well, this one dates back to the turn of 
the century, the one at Tulane. But business

03:57.043 --> 04:03.471
colleges and schools in those days were highly 
descriptive. Really, their enrollments weren't

04:05.233 --> 04:08.718
very large. But business administration, 
through in part the impact of two major studies,

04:10.260 --> 04:19.352
one by the Ford Foundation, one by the Rockefeller 
Foundation, which were highly critical of what

04:20.547 --> 04:25.434
was going on in business administration. The 
field of business administration went through a

04:26.676 --> 04:31.322
remarkable transformation. So when did you get to 
Tulane? In 1958. Went to Tennessee in 1954. Judy

04:41.476 --> 04:42.958
and I married in 1953. He's made that connection. I 
met her at Vanderbilt. In 1967, I was enticed to

04:49.252 --> 04:56.839
leave Tulane.

04:58.260 --> 05:03.605
New Orleans was a, parenthetically I should note 
that New Orleans is a difficult place to raise

04:58.260 --> 05:03.605
children. And we had two children by then. And so we 
were intrigued by the rural

05:08.389 --> 05:19.039
environment here. Our daughter was very much into 
horses. And so it seemed like a good idea. I was also

05:25.766 --> 05:41.028
impressed by the fact that the American 
Association of University Professors listed

05:25.766 --> 05:41.028
Texas A&M for a couple of years there as offering 
the highest increases in salaries of any. Not of

05:42.530 --> 05:46.777
any, but it was in the top 10 in terms of salary 
increases. That was impressive for those of us

05:46.797 --> 05:49.060
teaching in Louisiana. Yes. About that time. 
Wasn't it, though? Yes, it was. You were there,

05:51.038 --> 05:51.638
sure. So, over we came. You must have come around 
that same time. 69. Okay. And a $3,500 raise. I

06:00.731 --> 06:03.414
thought that was a monstrous amount of money. I 
left there. I was acting dean of the School of

06:06.178 --> 06:12.206
Business, and I came here for a couple thousand 
dollars. Several thousand. And it was a lot of

06:14.048 --> 06:15.250
money. It was a lot of money. It was a lot of money in 
those days, yes. It really was. Well, it was

06:20.335 --> 06:26.724
obvious that

06:20.335 --> 06:26.724
I have to give a lot of credit to Earl Rudder. Earl 
Rudder was out to put this institution on a map, and

06:26.844 --> 06:44.967
it wasn't too many years before, of course, that

06:26.844 --> 06:44.967
membership at the undergraduate level in the 
Corps of Cadets was no longer mandatory, and women

06:26.844 --> 06:44.967
had been... The bar had been lifted on women. Not 
too many years after I came here, after the death of

06:48.622 --> 07:12.118
Earl Rudder and the arrival of President Jack 
Kenny Williams, women's dormitories were built,

06:48.622 --> 07:12.118
and

06:48.622 --> 07:12.118
then I think a substantial growth era was ushered 
in. When you came, you were dean, associate dean?

07:15.371 --> 07:16.653
No, I came as a full professor. As a full professor. 
In the Department of Management. OK. Not head, as a

07:18.715 --> 07:22.039
full professor. Who was the dean? Well, remember, 
it wasn't a college. It wasn't, yeah. The director

07:30.208 --> 07:34.413
was John Pearson.

07:36.736 --> 07:41.481
Within, I guess, a year or so, it became a college.

07:44.448 --> 07:52.015
And within another year, 1969, Pearson had hired a 
person to be head of the finance department. And on

07:54.218 --> 08:12.936
the Friday preceding class,

07:54.218 --> 08:12.936
not enrollment, but first day of classes on 
Monday, this chap wrote and said he couldn't come,

07:54.218 --> 08:12.936
or telegraphed to say he couldn't come. And John 
Pearson asked me to serve as acting department

08:13.810 --> 08:18.236
head. Well, that developed into a lasting 
relationship for nearly eight years in January of

08:19.337 --> 08:36.600
76,

08:19.337 --> 08:36.600
77? I have to work it out anyway. We can check it out. 
That's OK. I had double bypass surgery, so I

08:42.262 --> 08:48.549
stepped down. And I was going to step down anyway, 
because two four-year terms were up. And we had in

08:55.097 --> 09:05.569
the college a rule about no more than two four-year 
terms, a rule not observed necessarily in other

08:55.097 --> 09:05.569
colleges, as you know. Then after the surgery, I 
taught just as a professor for a year, and then was

09:07.523 --> 09:15.694
asked to serve as acting dean.

09:19.059 --> 09:21.302
And that would have been 78, 79, I guess. Pearson 
left at that time, or I'm trying to remember that.

09:25.708 --> 09:27.250
He left shortly afterwards. He went down to 3D

09:27.290 --> 09:34.681
International. That's the right name. I became 
associate dean under Bill Muse. We, in the

09:41.564 --> 09:46.949
meantime, had recruited Bill Muse to become a 
dean. And in about April or May, effective July 1, I

09:48.271 --> 10:04.767
became dean of faculties in 1980, where I remained 
until August 31. Now,

10:05.084 --> 10:18.725
would you mind telling me a little bit about the 
purpose and intent of the dean of faculty's

10:05.084 --> 10:18.725
position, as you recall? Because it had just been 
relatively recently created. Yeah, I was the

10:21.569 --> 10:24.173
second dean of faculty's. You will recall that 
Haskell Monroe was the first. And apparently,

10:30.443 --> 10:34.028
that job was in part created President Jack 
Williams because he was so impressed by the

10:34.396 --> 10:50.812
welcoming address given by Haskell representing 
the faculty at President Williams'

10:34.396 --> 10:50.812
inauguration. And so he was in for four or five 
years, I guess. I don't have to check that out. And

11:00.241 --> 11:04.065
so when I came in, there were just the vice 
president for academic affairs, Mack Prescott,

11:04.703 --> 11:21.586
and

11:04.703 --> 11:21.586
Charles McCandless, who was associate vice 
president. My title, I should back up, Haskell's

11:21.706 --> 11:28.355
title had been associate dean of faculties and 
associate vice president. That position was

11:28.956 --> 11:33.462
split, and McCandless became associate vice 
president for academic affairs, and I became dean

11:33.948 --> 11:39.515
of faculties then.

11:43.120 --> 11:58.900
I was not in office but a few months when Jarvis 
Miller,

11:43.120 --> 11:58.900
I don't know how you want to put it, resigned or was 
asked to resign by the board. I think it was around

12:03.361 --> 12:07.446
Anyway, July or August, July meeting, I guess, 
this occurred. And for a year, Chuck Sampson was

12:09.990 --> 12:21.725
president,

12:09.990 --> 12:21.725
which would take him through August of 81, at which 
time Frank Vandiver became president. And not too

12:23.227 --> 12:33.300
long thereafter, I was once again given the title 
of dean of faculties and associate vice

12:23.227 --> 12:33.300
president. And Chuck left about that time. No, he 
didn't leave. Oh, he didn't. He didn't leave for

12:38.573 --> 12:40.615
several years. Mac Prescott stepped down a year or 
so along with Howard Vestal about the same time as

12:40.996 --> 12:49.627
vice president. Vestal was vice president for 
finance.

12:56.396 --> 13:03.085
And Chuck served as acting vice president for a 
year.

13:04.482 --> 13:08.046
Gordon Eaton became provost at that time. The 
title, provost, was added. I guess it was at that

13:11.530 --> 13:19.939
time that I became an additional associate 
provost. Those are really changing times, I

13:19.979 --> 13:22.962
guess. Seventy, what, six to eighty, whatever, 
five, it's always changed. They were dynamic

13:27.627 --> 13:29.089
times. Of course, the times The real changes began 
when Windman came in, and there were only a handful

13:31.702 --> 13:38.351
when you and I were there at first. Sure were. I 
still remember my first class. Yeah. And

13:41.715 --> 13:58.097
Williams, an unsung hero, I think, of this 
institution, at least not appropriately

13:41.715 --> 13:58.097
recognized with John C. Calhoun, who was the vice 
president for academic affairs, was he who

13:59.427 --> 14:05.335
initiated our becoming and saw that we did become a 
Sea Grant University. He brought in people like

14:06.336 --> 14:17.171
George

14:06.336 --> 14:17.171
Bass, Archaeology, and the big growth started. 
So, I think there were like 10,500 11,000

14:21.837 --> 14:23.499
students. When you came in 67. When I came in 67. 
That'd be about right, because it was around 12 or

14:25.261 --> 14:28.885
13 when I got here in 69. And I'll never forget in 
what was then called the Academic Council, while

14:29.166 --> 14:44.003
General Rutter was still alive, hearing him 
speculate as he presided over this as to what caps

14:29.166 --> 14:44.003
we should put on the size of the institution. I 
remember that in discussions, yeah. The figure of

14:46.166 --> 14:51.152
15,000 or maybe 17,500 or 18,000. would be a nice 
number. Never happened. It never happened. I

14:58.765 --> 15:09.581
think we were so growth-minded and, I suppose, 
influenced by the enormous size of UT and a desire

14:58.765 --> 15:09.581
to be big. I think I asked Mandon for that question. 
I said, did the board really want to keep up with

15:12.485 --> 15:15.950
Texas? Is that what it was all about? I don't know 
how you responded. I remember when talking with

15:20.026 --> 15:34.825
Haskell Monroe as he was leaving and I was coming 
in, and he left pretty quickly, so I think he and I

15:20.026 --> 15:34.825
overlapped a week maybe, so I didn't really have a 
long learning period. But anyway, I remember

15:34.845 --> 15:45.900
asking Haskell about what are the chances of 
capping growth, and I won't quote the particular

15:34.845 --> 15:45.900
regent, but he said, that'll be over my dead body. 
Yeah, sure. He's still with us. But eventually we

15:51.551 --> 15:55.476
did, of course, at 41,000 a few years ago. What was 
your primary mission or function as a dean of

15:56.177 --> 16:00.142
faculties? And how would you describe the 
changing

16:00.202 --> 16:08.992
character, I guess, of the faculty as you've seen 
it? Well, in part, Obviously, I represented the

16:13.280 --> 16:17.805
faculty to the administration, I suppose. That 
was the role that I felt I inherited. Probably the

16:20.487 --> 16:33.840
most important single function that I performed 
was to manage the process of tenure and promotion,

16:20.487 --> 16:33.840
which became increasingly rigorous. Mack 
Prescott certainly moved in that direction.

16:39.987 --> 16:42.409
Gordon Eaton introduced the concept of requiring 
outside letters. And so the process became

16:47.469 --> 17:04.233
increasingly rigorous and, I have to say, more 
bureaucratized as we

16:47.469 --> 17:04.233
tried to make it as fair as possible, both for the 
faculty and for the administration. So that was

17:04.814 --> 17:06.376
certainly important. Also, of course, as did 
Haskell before me, I suppose, I listened to

17:13.422 --> 17:20.710
complaints that faculty had and tried to do 
something about them. OK, let me ask, what kind of

17:20.730 --> 17:23.994
complaints did faculty have? Was there any single 
orientation to those complaints? Well, many of

17:29.019 --> 17:33.043
them emanated from they're not getting tenure. 
That's a time when folks started getting turned

17:34.165 --> 17:40.932
down in greater percentages. Those are hard, 
aren't they? For tenure and promotion, they

17:43.040 --> 17:44.662
really are. They were heart-wrenching.

17:48.987 --> 17:51.871
And we didn't inform faculty adequately. There 
was a notable lack of counseling on the part of

17:51.931 --> 18:08.413
department heads on the subject of whether they 
were progressing satisfactorily to our tenure.

18:08.433 --> 18:10.716
As a department head, you would be well aware of 
this. There were

18:11.557 --> 18:30.016
problems associated with the fact that turnover 
would occur, and a person would believe he or she

18:11.557 --> 18:30.016
was doing well under Department Head A, but under 
B, the game changed. And this brought about

18:31.078 --> 18:39.066
further bureaucratization by requiring that 
there be an advisory committee for the Department

18:31.078 --> 18:39.066
Head. to provide, we hoped, some continuity. I can 
recall an incident where two fellows served under

18:43.000 --> 19:04.308
three different department heads and three 
different deans in the space of six years, with

18:43.000 --> 19:04.308
varying signals being given to them. So that was a 
problem. Salary complaints. A major one which

19:08.054 --> 19:25.570
ultimately ended up in a trial that

19:08.054 --> 19:25.570
was decided only finally a couple of years ago 
about a foreign national who felt that because he

19:08.054 --> 19:25.570
was a foreign national he had been discriminated 
against. There were cases of females feeling that

19:27.672 --> 19:32.096
they were discriminated against. I got 
increasingly involved in the sexual harassment

19:37.332 --> 19:52.137
issues, which was a very tricky kind of thing 
because our early efforts led to sort of letting

19:37.332 --> 19:52.137
people go quietly away, and that always bothered 
me. When did you first become aware of sexual

19:52.938 --> 20:00.150
harassment as a problem in that community? This 
had always been there. It had been there. But it

20:03.272 --> 20:06.054
never would have been overt. We hadn't had very 
many women, of course, until the mid-'70s.

20:12.460 --> 20:15.263
And for the most part, they just put up with it, 
apparently.

20:18.065 --> 20:28.535
There were some

20:18.065 --> 20:28.535
pretty salty characters that had been at the 
institution for some time. And some of them used

20:28.675 --> 20:30.897
language, which women found offensive. Some were 
actually, you know, what's a woman doing here kind

20:34.059 --> 20:38.244
of thing. So there was gender harassment. 
Certainly that must have been fairly strong. Of

20:43.591 --> 20:46.595
course, we had at least a perception of that in the 
Department of History. Yes, yes. And then some of

20:49.019 --> 20:59.172
the colleges which had been so male-dominated, 
agriculture and engineering, for example, it was

20:49.019 --> 20:59.172
a problem. I do not recall it to be much of a problem. 
in the College of Business, but it was such a young

21:02.669 --> 21:05.112
college. Only a handful of, quote, old-timers 
were there, because the school grew so fast. You

21:11.519 --> 21:18.627
recall in the war years, it was part of the College 
of Agriculture, and it had been called part of

21:11.519 --> 21:18.627
liberal arts. Were you, how about affirmative 
action as a part of your role? That came in

21:25.075 --> 21:31.242
certainly

21:25.075 --> 21:31.242
with Frank Vandiver, who was very much interested 
in that.

21:38.681 --> 21:52.319
I like to think that I played a, and I know I played a 
supportive role and an encouraging role along

21:38.681 --> 21:52.319
with the President and others in upper level 
administration to support the creation of the

21:38.681 --> 21:52.319
Senate. Yeah, okay. And the Faculty Senate, do you 
think the Faculty Senate markedly changed the

21:59.774 --> 22:03.801
complexion or character of whatever, the A&M, the 
academia? Yes, I think it did. I think. As a more

22:07.908 --> 22:10.032
democratic society or what? Yes, I think more 
democratic, more sensitive to issues that

22:10.172 --> 22:18.326
affected faculty. Did it improve recruiting? Did 
it improve? I think it did. I think it did, yes. How

22:27.472 --> 22:31.977
about ultimately teaching the quality of the 
educational process? I think so. The Faculty

22:33.138 --> 22:52.917
Senate spent a substantial amount of time 
developing a document which then became appended

22:33.138 --> 22:52.917
to the tenure and promotion document of the 
university,

22:33.138 --> 22:52.917
which sought to identify qualities for teaching, 
research, and service that

22:53.234 --> 23:17.743
I think informed our process, made it better in 
evaluating tenure track and tenured faculty for

22:53.234 --> 23:17.743
promotion.

23:19.886 --> 23:21.688
The pendulum may have gone too far for a while in 
terms of national reputation criteria, in

23:22.276 --> 23:45.277
particular publication,

23:22.276 --> 23:45.277
without sufficient latitude to recognize the 
really outstanding teacher who was not doing as

23:22.276 --> 23:45.277
much research. Interestingly enough, if you look 
at the records, you'll find a not small number of

23:51.959 --> 23:59.649
people who have gotten both the former Students 
Association outstanding teaching and research

23:51.959 --> 23:59.649
awards. And research, which is the way it should 
be. Matter of fact, I'm proud to say I hired two

24:00.630 --> 24:07.659
people in the Department of Finance who got both 
awards. Yeah, that's where it's supposed to work.

24:09.661 --> 24:16.230
But back to your question about the Senate, yes, I 
think it would have come anyway, but it's

24:09.661 --> 24:16.230
certainly... Probably in a more bloody year. It 
might have been a more bloody thing. The fact that

24:19.955 --> 24:21.156
the president... Stuck his neck out, because 
there wasn't a lot of support, certainly in the

24:22.283 --> 24:30.131
board, in my opinion. Yeah, he mentioned 
specifically, as I recall, engineering as not

24:30.151 --> 24:33.935
being too enthusiastic. And agriculture, too. 
Faculty centers, yeah. Yeah. Well, if we could

24:38.280 --> 24:41.163
talk on the record for a minute, we might better 
not. But the Senate opened up... a

24:47.495 --> 25:06.037
willingness on the part of the powers that be to 
accept a lot of things, such as a faculty club,

24:47.495 --> 25:06.037
which could offer alcoholic beverages. And there 
was some concern about that. But it came to be. And I

25:12.705 --> 25:14.727
think it serves a useful function. And I was 
pleased to be involved with it. with that

25:17.617 --> 25:20.020
development, too. Did you feel like you were 
caught sometimes between the faculty and the

25:20.040 --> 25:23.143
administration? Oh, yes. That's a tough spot 
you're in. No. The job is one of being an

25:29.450 --> 25:32.794
ombudsperson. And I was caught in a number of ways. 
And any dean of faculties is caught in a number of

25:36.778 --> 25:45.868
ways in that it's not only between the faculty and 
the administration, but it's between, well, I had

25:46.777 --> 25:55.230
to be very careful talking with a faculty member 
who hadn't gone through proper channels through

25:46.777 --> 25:55.230
his department head or his dean. Sometimes all I 
could do was say, look, we've got to come out in the

25:57.313 --> 26:05.345
open if we're going to try to address this issue. 
Are you willing to do that? And if they weren't,

26:07.028 --> 26:11.695
then there wasn't much I could do. But a lot of times 
I could. There were some cases in one college,

26:14.283 --> 26:25.279
particularly, where people were arbitrarily 
moved from one department to another without

26:14.283 --> 26:25.279
consultation. And we did blow the whistle on that. 
I mean, it was just wrong. So we had to dismantle

26:33.270 --> 26:43.345
some decisions on the part of the dean and a 
director. And so sometimes it got kind of tough.

26:50.702 --> 26:57.950
But it

26:50.702 --> 26:57.950
was a tension-ridden job. I don't think it would 
be. I don't see, quite frankly, how you survived as

26:59.171 --> 27:05.258
well and as unflappably as you did. I never saw you 
lose your temper, which is incredible. Well, I

27:08.501 --> 27:11.244
came home sometimes in a pretty bad shape. I bet you 
did. But sometimes things were just so, you know,

27:13.666 --> 27:21.718
you just wondered how people could treat other 
people like that. Sometimes people would be named

27:21.738 --> 27:26.546
department heads and then begin to act like 
dictators. Oh, that's what I want to ask you about,

27:27.627 --> 27:42.610
too, about the headship and about what might be the 
unique administrative structures at A&M, if they

27:27.627 --> 27:42.610
are even now, or maybe they've changed, you think, 
to conform pretty much to the... Headship is

27:27.627 --> 27:42.610
fairly common. in state

27:43.383 --> 27:48.528
institutions. Chairmanship, much more common in 
private institutions.

27:54.214 --> 27:59.680
But I think increasingly heads here have operated 
like chairs. Yeah, I think so too. With a consent of

28:01.441 --> 28:04.184
the... There was, I think, over the years, an 
increasing recognition of the fact that faculty

28:04.224 --> 28:11.972
members are equals with a dean or with a department 
head. And the mere fact that they don't have an

28:19.771 --> 28:30.602
administrative title tacked on doesn't mean that 
they can be treated like a typical employer,

28:19.771 --> 28:30.602
employee. Faculty members are, particularly 
those who do establish a national reputation, are

28:31.523 --> 28:40.812
indeed free agents. You know, the early years of 
this institution, most of the folks were indeed

28:41.230 --> 28:50.761
focused very much on teaching, with no little 
exceptions. But they really didn't have anywhere

28:50.781 --> 28:56.207
to go if they didn't like the way things were. 
Whereas in the 70s and 80s, that changed

28:57.949 --> 29:03.695
dramatically.

29:07.500 --> 29:09.702
How about the student body? How has it changed, do 
you think, over your 25 years or so, 30 years that

29:10.002 --> 29:15.167
you've been? Politically, it still remains 
ultra-conservative, I think. I think that it's

29:19.612 --> 29:27.821
remarkable when you look at the election returns 
from the ballot boxes on campus.

29:31.425 --> 29:38.372
Students, I think, now, though, feel much more 
free to express themselves. to disagree with a

29:38.791 --> 29:40.774
professor. And I think that's healthy. OK. You 
would say there's a greater what? A diversity or?

29:46.483 --> 29:47.685
Greater diversity. License? That's not the word. 
But I know what you're saying. I'll work with it,

29:52.372 --> 29:54.075
too. There's greater academic freedom among the 
students as well as among the faculty, perhaps.

30:06.280 --> 30:07.101
What about the core? I guess I need to ask that 
question. Well, you'll recall when you and I first

30:09.843 --> 30:14.127
came, the core really was dominant. I once 
remarked to somebody that when one walked across

30:14.888 --> 30:21.955
the campus, one felt propelled on a sea of howdies. 
And of course, that has the core diminished. And I

30:28.421 --> 30:34.026
suppose the Vietnam War had an impact on the size of 
the core. I'm trying to remember how many students

30:35.002 --> 30:38.086
there were in it when I came. I would think at least 
half, but I don't know, or better. All I can

30:42.272 --> 30:46.178
remember is my freshman class. Over in physics, I 
had 130 students. And I know at least almost all of

30:49.823 --> 30:54.770
them in uniform, and one female. Most of the 
students in uniform were asleep. I still remember

30:57.635 --> 30:59.577
that. Oh, my gosh. What's going on? I finally found 
out. They'd been up all night and nights before.

31:06.549 --> 31:07.570
Yeah, being harassed. Well, another thing, do you 
remember, or had it disappeared by the time you

31:08.531 --> 31:19.743
came, that incredibly wacky teaching schedule 
one would have of Monday and Wednesday at 9

31:08.531 --> 31:19.743
o'clock? Yeah, that went out about Thursday of the 
first year or something like that. Oh, wasn't that

31:23.327 --> 31:26.671
wacky? I mean, yeah. That was very hard to keep up 
with. I get confused. It really was. Particularly

31:32.189 --> 31:52.881
if you're teaching the same class as often one was, 
twice or maybe even three times, you'd have

31:32.189 --> 31:52.881
a class meeting for 50 minutes Monday, Wednesday, 
and Friday, and another class meeting for an hour

31:32.189 --> 31:52.881
and 50 minutes. Well, I guess we're still doing 
that, aren't we? Well, on Tuesday, Thursday.

31:58.288 --> 31:58.889
Tuesday, Thursday. Tuesday, Thursday, yeah. I 
used to find that frustrating. But it was really

32:01.813 --> 32:04.217
crazy back when you had that crazy. Yeah, that 
other. You know, unless you kept your wits about

32:05.498 --> 32:08.723
you, which I never did. I still don't. You could end 
up getting on the wrong track. Because here it was

32:13.970 --> 32:20.239
afternoon, and you taught a 1 o'clock, Monday, 
Wednesday, and Friday, and now you're, oh, well.

32:20.379 --> 32:25.907
That's why I stick to Monday, Wednesday, Friday, 
8, 10, and 11 if I have to have the third class or

32:20.379 --> 32:25.907
something like that. How

32:26.208 --> 32:42.491
would you rate the attitude or character of the A&M 
student body as you might compare it to other Texas

32:26.208 --> 32:42.491
or other university student bodies? Well, if you 
look at the numbers, they're big. And if you look at

32:47.899 --> 32:55.810
their admission scores and so forth, now 
certainly there is approximately the same as the

32:56.397 --> 33:00.883
University of Texas. I found the students to be 
pretty good students when I came here, when I

33:01.363 --> 33:09.253
stayed awake. Yeah, I do too. Tulane was kind of an 
exclusive school, with a lot of students from New

33:12.097 --> 33:17.824
York, by the way. I didn't realize that. Yeah, 
there really was.

33:26.468 --> 33:30.693
But in any event, I was pleased with the caliber of 
the students. It bothered me that they seemed to

33:31.214 --> 33:38.103
refrain from asking questions as much as I would 
have liked. I did not find the graduate students as

33:39.685 --> 33:42.008
good. I was appalled the first year I was here. I had 
two flagrant cases of plagiarism on the term

33:45.812 --> 33:53.522
papers at the graduate level. and was dismayed to 
learn that neither of these graduate students had

33:54.059 --> 34:02.267
ever written a term paper before. That was a 
chronic problem. And didn't know what plagiarism

34:03.528 --> 34:05.790
was. I didn't flunk them out, which I would have at 
Tulane, because they knew better under the honor

34:06.911 --> 34:14.398
code there. I was surprised we didn't have an honor 
code here. Tulane did. You're right. Sure. Yeah. I

34:22.460 --> 34:24.742
guess the Corps somehow or other hadn't had that 
covered. I don't know. How about the Aggie

34:26.444 --> 34:36.453
syndrome or whatever, you know, as being the 
hayseed, the engineering Aggie

34:26.444 --> 34:36.453
characterization? Was that, did you ever feel 
that was appropriate or inappropriate? Yeah. You

34:41.338 --> 34:45.742
heard the expression a lot in those early days of a 
goat roper. Yeah. You never hear it anymore. No.

34:48.845 --> 34:51.808
You still see the occasional student with his, 
well, quite a few with boots, cowboy hats, but it

34:52.092 --> 34:57.701
was much more prevalent. It's kind of even nice to 
see them now. Yeah, I enjoy it. It's diversity, and

35:01.086 --> 35:03.630
I think it's kind of fun. Judy, I thought, was going 
to be gone a lot longer. She's been over

35:06.495 --> 35:08.198
registering graduates. I said, come on, man. Oh, 
really? This guy's going to act like he's got to

35:09.840 --> 35:14.808
have affection now. Well, yeah, they were. I 
suppose in those days, a lot of them were from rural

35:19.700 --> 35:23.905
areas. But

35:23.946 --> 35:29.633
this estate is a highly urbanized state now. Yeah. 
And you know, one thing is, statistically, all A&M

35:31.035 --> 35:35.260
students have always come from Monk. Hi. How are 
you doing? OK. How are you? The job didn't last

35:38.304 --> 35:39.846
long. No, it didn't. My job.

35:47.662 --> 35:57.853
Under Vandiver, there really was a strong effort 
to increase minority

35:47.662 --> 35:57.853
faculty. And he was successful in getting the 
board to appropriate

36:00.075 --> 36:09.005
significant sums of money. Now, what we did was, 
for a year or two,

36:09.085 --> 36:17.314
offer a a position to a department if they could 
find a qualified minority. You remember that? I

36:22.889 --> 36:24.210
used it. I'm sure you did. Everybody did. When we 
cut back to 50%, because we were getting hard up for

36:26.533 --> 36:35.765
money, the effort declined somewhat. But in any 
event, that was certainly a phenomenon that I was

36:37.147 --> 36:43.875
involved with and encouraging. the money 
available was administered through my office. So

36:49.858 --> 36:52.721
that was a new task that Haskell never had.

36:56.906 --> 37:01.852
Sexual harassment probably wasn't something he 
had to deal with very much. It just got more

37:02.012 --> 37:04.334
noticeable. You were on a lot of the committees 
also. Search committees, and all kinds of others.

37:13.167 --> 37:15.710
Curriculum committee, graduate studies 
committee.

37:18.453 --> 37:30.106
Chaired the search committees for Jiminy, dean of 
liberal arts twice, dean of engineering. Herb,

37:30.867 --> 37:34.291
the committee that brought Herb in, I chaired. 
Science, medicine.

37:41.720 --> 37:50.514
I chaired geosciences when Gordon Eaton came, and 
then twice I chaired, or three times I chaired vice

37:41.720 --> 37:50.514
president committees. Were you, when the medical 
college began, how much involvement did you have?

37:58.627 --> 38:01.852
It was in existence when I came in. Bob Stone was 
dean. In fact, Stone was on the committee that

38:03.574 --> 38:07.761
recommended me to the, to the president and vice 
president for my position. Although I did chair

38:14.212 --> 38:17.596
the committee that brought Rich Duvall here. Very 
broadly speaking, what did you see in the last 10 or

38:18.237 --> 38:33.017
15 years, the great strengths and the great 
confrontations or difficulties

38:18.237 --> 38:33.017
that the university encountered? What's the 
greatest problem, let's say? Let's start with

38:35.340 --> 38:37.883
that, the tough things. The tough things have been 
to increase the diversity in the faculty. That

38:44.313 --> 38:49.442
certainly was tough.

38:54.992 --> 39:01.643
When you've got this military heritage and all 
that goes with it, I suppose there was abroad in the

39:02.483 --> 39:06.527
land a reluctance to even consider coming here. 
And we continue to operate under a severe

39:07.188 --> 39:11.653
disadvantage because of the community. This is 
not a congenial place for a minority to live. It's

39:17.138 --> 39:28.390
not that it's, it's not, I shouldn't say 
congenial, but it's just that there is no

39:17.138 --> 39:28.390
infrastructure, middle class, blacks 
particularly, and not much of a I'm an Hispanic

39:28.589 --> 39:30.331
middle class. I don't know if you had much 
involvement with them, but did you have any sense

39:30.591 --> 39:43.505
of support or opposition from former students in 
these changes at work? Well, there was, you will

39:43.585 --> 39:51.313
recall, considerable difficulty.

39:51.513 --> 39:54.336
I don't think not with bringing in minorities, no. 
Where we had problems was with foreign teachers

39:58.947 --> 40:02.030
and teaching assistants. Math, particularly. 
Oh, math, yes. Elton Lacy did a marvelous job of

40:08.696 --> 40:19.986
capturing the mamas, but they dissented en masse 
on us with their complaints. And of course, a

40:21.007 --> 40:25.951
student who wasn't doing well could always use 
this as an excuse. And it is true. that Indians,

40:28.698 --> 40:33.623
particularly in Orientals, are sometimes 
difficult. Good at math and not too good at the

40:33.663 --> 40:35.424
languages. That's right. That's right. Yeah. 
Well, you know, we had that problem with Zoltan.

40:40.149 --> 40:43.031
Even in our department, we were Zoltan Kastami. 
And I kept telling the students, you'll just sit

40:43.051 --> 40:45.934
there one week. You'll love him. And they did. 
Yeah. That first day, a lot of them were just deaf.

40:50.819 --> 40:51.840
They could not understand. Just getting used to 
it. But he was a good teacher. Are there other

40:56.457 --> 41:01.963
confrontational problems, difficulties that 
the university really faced that you... There was

41:01.983 --> 41:03.825
opposition over the Senate. There was, you 
recall, the committee that Sam Black chaired to

41:03.845 --> 41:17.680
revise the curriculum was kind of a sticky wicket 
for a while.

41:21.484 --> 41:25.468
Certainly the issue of of seniors having to take 
the final exams was a sticky wicket. One after

41:36.920 --> 41:51.817
another, these little traditions got knocked 
down, and so that kind of distressed some people.

41:51.857 --> 41:54.080
The issue of gays, I was not involved. The student 
problems were issues were not issues that I really

41:56.330 --> 42:03.160
got involved with. Yeah, yeah. Well, that's 
someone I'm going to try to interview. It's John

42:05.564 --> 42:06.986
Coldis, too. I need to talk to him about some of 
those activities. Then there were, oh, there was a

42:12.415 --> 42:20.447
longstanding bureaucratic

42:24.022 --> 42:27.588
stuffiness about doing things the way they had 
always been done. I shall never forget when I was a

42:28.509 --> 42:51.345
department head, my secretary being absolutely 
inflamed by the fact that someone

42:28.509 --> 42:51.345
in the business offices of the university 
returning an envelope that had not been folded the

42:28.509 --> 42:51.345
correct way, so that open the envelope could be to 
get at the form inside. And I called the then

42:56.449 --> 43:00.635
comptroller. Now, I came out of a place where a 
professor was a professor, and if you didn't like

43:00.656 --> 43:07.365
things, you'd call whoever was responsible. And 
so this was 20 years ago, I guess. I think it was

43:11.171 --> 43:14.096
Clark Diebel I called. I was so angry about that. I 
said, don't these people understand why they've

43:17.120 --> 43:20.505
got a job? You know, that kind of thing. I'll never 
forget another thing. This is an aside, but it

43:24.911 --> 43:30.821
illustrates the kind of bureaucratic attitude. 
Graduate students failing to get paid on time and

43:31.723 --> 43:36.110
being forced. And the local banks giving them 
non-interest loans. Why should the banks have to

43:39.556 --> 43:42.941
pay for the incompetence of the university? Yes, 
of the administration, yeah. Well. That was

43:45.225 --> 43:45.866
always. Damn. And new faculty coming and not 
getting their paychecks on time.

43:51.368 --> 43:52.570
Unconscionable. Well, that happened to me when I 
first came, as a matter of fact. And Milton, of all

43:56.355 --> 44:00.179
people, is usually on top of everything. And I 
didn't even dare ask, though. For several weeks,

44:02.723 --> 44:06.668
at least, and finally I said, when do I get paid? He 
said, you're not paid. I said, well. I imagine he

44:08.931 --> 44:10.272
did something about it. He did something about it 
instantly, but still. Dave Maxwell told me that,

44:12.535 --> 44:15.619
well, no. Milton was something of a curmudgeon. 
Nonetheless, he was protective of his faculty. He

44:21.163 --> 44:22.465
took care of the faculty. He really did. They 
didn't appreciate it all that much, but he did. In

44:25.391 --> 44:36.231
fact, I think there was a time there when the 
Department of History salary level scale was

44:25.391 --> 44:36.231
about as good as any department in the university, 
only because of Milton Nance. I doubt that it's

44:36.251 --> 44:39.497
held that since then. One of the real fun parts of my 
job was I inherited the chairmanship of the A&M

44:39.747 --> 44:47.856
Press Committee, which is always a joy. That's a 
good point. I need to flag the press, too, in this

44:50.319 --> 44:58.768
revision, which sometimes I forget about. Yeah, 
that has been a nice thing to do. What about the

45:03.642 --> 45:05.864
legislature now? Did you ever go to the 
legislature? Did you go to the board meetings?

45:09.669 --> 45:19.519
Yeah,

45:09.669 --> 45:19.519
under Vanderburg and Miller, a lot of people went 
to the board meetings. Under Mobley and even

45:20.981 --> 45:31.793
before that, I guess, the board got a little tired 
of having a mob scene and most of us just stood

45:20.981 --> 45:31.793
around. waited outside while the board 
deliberated in private and that sort of thing. And

45:38.470 --> 45:49.086
I went, oh, I suppose maybe a half dozen times to the 
legislature just in case they'd ask a question

45:38.470 --> 45:49.086
about something and you'd be there to respond. But 
for the most part, it was a waste of time. What about

45:52.931 --> 46:01.003
A&M's funding generally and the competition 
between A&M and University of Texas while you

45:52.931 --> 46:01.003
were? We fared pretty well up until the mid-80s

46:01.169 --> 46:15.718
and then things started getting tight when OPEC 
fell apart.

46:17.369 --> 46:25.541
If you look at the funding, I don't know if you want 
to get into this, but Danny Parker could give you

46:17.369 --> 46:25.541
quite a good picture of what's happened to funding 
in the mid-'80s. The state is appropriating not

46:26.102 --> 46:33.553
much more than appropriating in 1986 to the 
university. Increasingly, we have had to use the

46:33.694 --> 46:40.464
available fund not just for faculty and not for 
excellence. Just to survive. But just to survive.

46:44.670 --> 46:45.992
I think when I went in, in 1980, probably the 
appropriation from the legislature, and you'd

46:46.732 --> 46:59.264
want to check this, was on the order of 50% of our 
total operating budget. It's down under like 36%

46:59.284 --> 47:03.308
or 7% now. That's why. That's a good point. Yeah. 
Yeah. That's why. And I don't want to make a big

47:07.592 --> 47:09.854
issue of it, but it's interesting. I think it's . 
Vandiver would say this is not a state-supported

47:14.255 --> 47:16.298
institution. It's a state.
