WEBVTT

00:03.068 --> 00:04.270
No worry. If I get off the track leading to 
something else that I wanted to weave in, if you

00:04.450 --> 00:13.824
don't like the direction I'm going, jerk my chain. 
Okay, okay, we're testing. This is March 7, 2002.

00:21.775 --> 00:32.451
We're out at Harper's Ferry in Nantucket, and I 
have the privilege and joy of interviewing Paul

00:21.775 --> 00:32.451
Lemming. Paul, to begin this, give a biographical 
sketch of young Paul Lemming and his family before

00:33.494 --> 00:43.105
you came to enroll at Texas A&M. I was born in 
Russellville, Arkansas, a little town at that

00:44.286 --> 00:53.056
time of about 4,000 people. I was born on the 3rd of 
October, 1929, exactly two weeks before the big

00:53.957 --> 01:03.147
stock market crash leading to the Great 
Depression. The town of Russellville was named

01:04.122 --> 01:15.934
for my great-great-grandfather, John Russell, 
who was a physician and founded the town. We left

01:18.536 --> 01:33.471
Russellville in 1940, moved to Fort Smith, 
Arkansas for a couple of years, and then moved to

01:18.536 --> 01:33.471
Little Rock, Arkansas in 1943.

01:37.467 --> 01:58.058
My father had been a traveling salesman

01:37.467 --> 01:58.058
with McKesson Robbins Drug Corporation, and an 
opening came up in the Houston office, which he

01:37.467 --> 01:58.058
thought was better for our family, better 
economically.

02:06.914 --> 02:12.440
I started Albert Sidney Johnston Junior High 
School in Houston. And shortly thereafter, we

02:12.880 --> 02:20.207
moved to Nacogdoches when my dad got a permanent 
territory. We set up housekeeping there in

02:21.349 --> 02:26.814
December of 1943. We lived there until 1945, 
February. And we moved to Beaumont, where my dad

02:34.437 --> 02:38.020
got a better territory. And I finished high school 
in Beaumont, Texas. And then... Which, I know what

02:46.788 --> 02:50.292
high school, but this tape doesn't. Which high 
school did you finish? Beaumont High School.

02:54.736 --> 02:55.436
Beaumont High. How big was that, your senior 
class, you remember? Our senior class was 256

02:58.860 --> 03:02.503
seniors. And your special extracurricular 
activities when you were at Beaumont High? I guess

03:09.013 --> 03:10.514
you would say athletics. That was athletics and 
studying and hunting and fishing, sleeping,

03:11.315 --> 03:20.023
whatever I had the chance. And, of course, I liked 
to date girls and dance. Now, I know that you were a

03:22.906 --> 03:25.228
superb hurdler. What else, what other sports? I 
was on the all-district football team. I was a

03:32.926 --> 03:38.792
tailback on offense and played safety and 
halfback on defense. Everybody played two ways in

03:38.812 --> 03:40.735
those days. Now, you graduated in spring of 48. 48.

03:46.101 --> 03:47.963
Why did you come to Texas A&M? What led you to be here 
instead of some other place? I had 50-some-odd

03:51.707 --> 04:02.899
offers of scholarships to different levels of 
universities throughout the United States,

03:51.707 --> 04:02.899
including the two military academies.

04:13.696 --> 04:15.398
Oklahoma, Oklahoma A&M. It was in those days. And I 
had pretty well narrowed the field down to Texas

04:18.102 --> 04:28.677
A&M and the University of Texas. I thought an awful 
lot of Coach Clyde Littlefield, who was the coach

04:30.259 --> 04:42.977
at TU at that time, and also Colonel Andy, Frank 
Anderson, who was the coach here at Texas A&M. And I

04:43.700 --> 04:48.565
was having difficulty sorting the two out. Sports 
writer's accounts of the battle were rather

04:49.586 --> 04:55.592
ambiguous. Buddy Davis, Walter Davis, who later 
became an All-American basketball player and an

04:56.052 --> 05:10.486
Olympian in the high jump, he and I were two very 
highly sought-after athletes, and we were having

04:56.052 --> 05:10.486
trouble making up our minds. He was at Nederland? 
He was at Nederland. And I had just about decided to

05:13.906 --> 05:20.933
go to Texas. The state track meet was held on the 
14th and 15th of May in 1948. And I went down there

05:28.079 --> 05:33.204
with my team from Beaumont. And we had a very good 
showing. And I won the high hurdles and the low

05:36.447 --> 05:41.972
hurdles. New World's record, the low hurdles. And 
on a lark I entered the 220 and placed fourth in the

05:44.779 --> 05:50.565
state 220. And that night, since I was in Austin, 
Coach Littlefield said, I want you to come out to

05:51.486 --> 06:04.198
such and such a fraternity house and meet some of 
the fraternity boys out there. They're going to be

06:04.218 --> 06:05.539
your brothers. And I said, well, OK. I'd love to. 
And so I went out to this. fraternity party, I don't

06:12.648 --> 06:16.033
recall what the Greek letters were. And they said, 
boy, we sure hope you pledge our fraternity. I

06:23.903 --> 06:24.965
said, really, why is that? They said, boy, with 
your academic credentials and your athletic

06:25.585 --> 06:33.416
credentials, it'll sure look good on our roster. 
And I said, why is that important? And they said,

06:36.841 --> 06:42.368
well, fraternities are rated by the names and the 
academic qualifications, athletic

06:42.905 --> 06:52.516
qualifications that their pledges have, and it'd 
sure make our fraternity look good. And I said, let

06:53.477 --> 06:56.721
me make sure I got this straight. You want me to come 
to the University of Texas not because I can get a

06:57.502 --> 07:08.394
good education here, but because I'll make your 
fraternity look good. Is that right? Oh, yeah.

07:10.056 --> 07:10.937
Yeah, that's right. I said, okay, thank you very 
much. So I went back home, and I thought about that

07:15.610 --> 07:19.695
for a while. And about the second week of June, I 
called up Colonel Andy and asked him if the

07:20.856 --> 07:32.810
scholarship offer was still open. He said, oh, 
yes, it is. About that time, Charlie Babcock,

07:35.413 --> 07:41.700
class of 1920, A&M, had been working on me pretty 
hard. And he had started a letter writing campaign

07:46.406 --> 07:52.574
to everybody he could think of. And all of a sudden 
these letters start pouring in. What did those

07:56.179 --> 07:58.642
letters in general, what did they say? They

07:58.682 --> 08:06.192
said, talked about what a great school Texas A&M 
was. They talked about the fraternity, of Texas

08:11.515 --> 08:12.617
A&M.

08:18.846 --> 08:26.838
They talked about what it meant

08:18.846 --> 08:26.838
to be an Aggie. There's a spirit that can never be 
told. That's about the size of it. I thought about

08:35.852 --> 08:36.874
that. I have a book right over there. those letters 
in it that Charlie Babcock put together for me. As

08:45.405 --> 08:58.220
you look back on all those letters, did anybody 
even hint at anything by the standards of that day

08:45.405 --> 08:58.220
or this one that were inappropriate? Nobody 
offered you any money? No, absolutely not. Nobody

09:02.905 --> 09:04.687
offered a car or anything else? No. Nobody ever 
even hinted at that kind of a thing. They just

09:09.582 --> 09:12.265
talked about what an experience. Now, am I 
over-quoting what you told me after the Austin

09:12.285 --> 09:17.051
muster? What I thought and what I think I 
remembered you told me that Charlie Babcock said

09:18.193 --> 09:26.823
was that you're too fine a person to go to the 
University of Texas. You ought to go to Texas A&M.

09:30.628 --> 09:34.172
Well, pretty much those same words. Describe, 
let's stay with Mr. Babcock a minute. Describe him

09:39.484 --> 09:43.490
physically and personality and activities. 
Charlie Babcock was about, oh, I'd say 5'8", 5'9",

09:44.551 --> 10:00.054
slightly rotund,

09:44.551 --> 10:00.054
receding hairline, jovial, always had a joke. In 
fact, it's hard to talk to him sometimes because He

10:05.101 --> 10:08.426
kept wanting to tell different kinds of jokes. But 
a better-hearted person never existed. Now, he

10:11.571 --> 10:13.253
worked at one of the refineries? No. Charlie 
Babcock was Mr. Insurance in Beaumont. He had C.L.

10:20.084 --> 10:26.794
Babcock and Sons Insurance Agency downtown on the 
Pearlstein Building. And he had two sons who went

10:26.814 --> 10:32.863
to A&M. One of them was a class of 45, and the other 
one, another I think was a class of 42.

10:42.486 --> 10:47.512
And they were killed early in their adult careers. 
One of the boys was killed in a Jeep accident.

10:50.355 --> 10:51.216
That's what I've heard. Overseas, and I don't 
recall how the other boy died, but it was a very

10:51.236 --> 10:58.004
tragic thing. He had no surviving children, did 
he? No, he and Bess. He had no other surviving

11:01.717 --> 11:04.179
children. Wait a minute. He may have had a 
daughter. Now, my memory may be fuzzy, but Wirus

11:08.063 --> 11:21.156
told me I thought that they had a daughter who died 
of an unknown heart problem as a little kid on the

11:08.063 --> 11:21.156
playground. That rings a bell. Because I then 
ventured the thought that he transferred the love

11:23.859 --> 11:30.846
he'd had for his children to his school, and that 
was his, and that A&M, in effect, was his big

11:31.163 --> 11:40.515
family. I'd say that's a very accurate 
assessment. The, all right, did you let him know

11:45.021 --> 11:52.531
when you decided you were going to come to A&M, did 
you let him know?

11:56.236 --> 11:58.719
He was the second person, I tell you. The first, no, 
he was the third. The first person I told was

12:01.623 --> 12:03.786
Colonel Andy. The second person I told was Clyde 
Littlefield. And Charlie Babcock was the third.

12:09.855 --> 12:12.719
How did each, what was the reaction of each of those 
three? You called them, I presume?

12:17.066 --> 12:18.989
I called Colonel Andy. He was delighted.

12:23.335 --> 12:29.925
Coach Littlefield was coming through Beaumont to 
talk to the Texas exes there in Beaumont. until his

12:30.884 --> 12:32.246
visit. It was a funny and ironic thing about his 
visit.

12:43.200 --> 12:49.288
There was a big picture in the paper on the sports 
page and a big story about all these letters and

12:43.200 --> 12:49.288
everything. Coach Littlefield came out to my 
house and he sat on the front porch with me and my

12:51.170 --> 12:58.900
folks and I told him that I decided to go to Texas, 
not to Texas A&M, and he said, well, why? And I had a

13:04.035 --> 13:06.617
stack of letters. I said, there's over 300 letters 
here. He said, we could have gotten you a thousand

13:10.802 --> 13:15.026
letters. I said, yes, sir, but you didn't. And he 
just got up and walked off. And then when you told

13:23.896 --> 13:27.199
Mr. Babcock, what was his reaction?

13:31.550 --> 13:33.193
I can't repeat what he said. He was very happy. All 
right. Had you been up to visit the campus before

13:39.905 --> 13:43.332
then, the A&M campus? Oh, yes, yes. What was your 
impression of visiting when you came? What did it

13:46.778 --> 13:47.740
seem like? Very friendly. I stayed in the dorm.

13:55.698 --> 13:58.682
The athletes were not staying at Hart Hall at that 
time. I came up here in the fall of 47 to attend a

13:59.643 --> 14:03.428
football game. And it was the Arkansas game. And I 
stayed in the dorm. And I went to the mess hall and I

14:09.716 --> 14:15.724
ate with the troops on the training table. I mean, 
it was just like being with a bunch of good old boys.

14:19.870 --> 14:22.313
Now, which dorm did they live in then? I think it was 
Leggett. Okay. And so they ate in Sevesa. Yeah. All

14:31.493 --> 14:33.395
the athletes ate in Sevesa. The next year, all of 
the athletes moved into Hart Hall, which was large

14:33.435 --> 14:40.244
enough to accommodate everybody. At that time, we 
were still getting a lot of veterans back. And, uh,

14:45.071 --> 14:49.757
could you turn that off for a second? When you, when 
you came to enroll, that freshman year, fall of 48.

14:53.798 --> 14:57.762
Who brought you? How'd you get here? What did you 
bring with you? My folks brought me, and we came by

15:02.807 --> 15:07.892
car. I had a footlocker, and we called it a 
go-to-hell bag, a little overnight thing about so

15:10.114 --> 15:23.687
long you'd buy in Walgreens to use when you're 
hitchhiking back and forth. to home or to a court

15:24.123 --> 15:27.590
trip or something like that. What was in that 
footlocker in that bag? The footlocker, there was

15:30.996 --> 15:46.165
one bedspread, one pillow, two pillowcases, four 
sheets,

15:30.996 --> 15:46.165
toilet articles,

15:48.743 --> 16:12.417
port shirt, a couple pairs of slacks, oh, I had, I 
carried a suit on a hanger, and a couple pairs of

15:48.743 --> 16:12.417
shoes, and various and sundry other small items of 
that nature, and a dictionary, and a typewriter. A

16:12.998 --> 16:15.962
typewriter, hey. Came in very handy. As you either 
in the car coming up here or as they got ready to

16:18.089 --> 16:26.559
leave, did your parents give you any special words 
of advice?

16:30.423 --> 16:31.865
If they did, I don't remember. They always found me 
to be very self-reliant. I was an only child, and I

16:37.751 --> 16:42.717
got all the love and affection in the world. So 
there were no warnings or advice to go to class and

16:47.283 --> 16:50.146
They never had to worry about that. Now, you had 
done well in academics. Where were you in the

16:53.550 --> 16:56.132
senior class at Beaumont High? I was number two. 
Number two. Did they call it salutatorian in those

16:59.836 --> 17:01.598
days? They did. I was not the salutatorian. I was 
number two academically according to grade

17:07.244 --> 17:10.808
point. Oh, okay. But the Beaumont Independent 
School District required any of those who wanted

17:15.397 --> 17:24.090
to stand for valedictorian or salutatorian to 
take an additional test. And I told them I wasn't

17:24.570 --> 17:39.692
going to take that test, and my record stood on its 
own, and that I felt that the test that they

17:24.570 --> 17:39.692
administered was too biased toward liberal arts 
and literature. Although I was an avid reader, I

17:40.673 --> 17:43.918
was I leaned more toward physics and math and that 
kind of thing, and I felt, I just, I told them I

17:44.607 --> 17:54.756
wouldn't untake it because it's biased. Now, I'm 
looking not at hindsight now, but at the time you

17:54.776 --> 18:06.386
arrived, how well did you think Beaumont High had 
prepared you for college academically?

18:09.109 --> 18:13.973
At the time I arrived, I wasn't sure because I 
didn't know what the curriculum was going to be

18:09.109 --> 18:13.973
here. But as I went more and more into the 
curriculum, I felt that I had the best possible

18:14.813 --> 18:23.881
education I could get. What did you think you were 
going to major in when you first got here? I had

18:28.625 --> 18:36.011
thought about majoring in engineering, 
mechanical engineering. This was when I was still

18:37.052 --> 18:39.213
in high school. But then as I looked at the 
curriculum more and more and looked at what I was

18:45.037 --> 18:55.187
going to have to devote my time to in athletics, I 
decided that perhaps some other line of study

18:45.037 --> 18:55.187
would be better. And at that time, Dean John Paul 
Abbott, who was dean of the School of Arts and

18:55.647 --> 19:11.483
Sciences, had convinced the administration that 
we needed to start a separate business school

19:13.302 --> 19:17.388
Business courses had been taught under the aegis 
of the arts and sciences. And he formed a

19:18.329 --> 19:28.283
department, not a school, we weren't big enough to 
have a school, a department of business

19:18.329 --> 19:28.283
administration, and I was in the first class. Oh, 
okay, good. Now, in high school you had played

19:31.007 --> 19:34.512
football. Were you planning to go out for any other 
sports other than track here at A&M? Oh, I

19:40.340 --> 19:42.583
definitely wanted to play football. But I was the 
first pure track athlete to come to Texas A&M on a

19:43.188 --> 19:51.017
four-year scholarship. Now, one other person 
preceded me, but he was not a track man. He was a

19:57.365 --> 19:58.205
field man. His name was George Cadera, class of 
1950. K-A-D-E-R. K-A-D-E-R-A, George Cadera.

20:07.376 --> 20:10.680
What did your scholarship, in fact, consist of? 
Room, board, books, tuition, fees? And $10 a month

20:14.611 --> 20:16.193
for laundry. Okay. As a matter of fact— Whoop, 
whoop, remember you've got that on. Yeah. Oh,

20:21.578 --> 20:21.878
okay. That's what I made sure I had.

20:26.623 --> 20:27.424
Oh, oh. As a matter of fact, as the saying goes, 
funny you should ask. Oh, you saved all those

20:31.428 --> 20:33.110
goodies. Here is my registration. My goodness. 
For the fall semester of 1950. Board, $40.80.

20:43.472 --> 20:46.094
Matriculation, $25. Medical, that's with good 
old mom, Claghorn, $5.50. Student activities, I

20:52.220 --> 20:56.884
don't know what that is, $1. Student activities, 
$9.20. Key deposit, $1. Room rent, $11.35. And

21:07.112 --> 21:09.314
laundry, $3.65. Mm-hmm, mm-hmm. And just as an 
aside, when I got my senior ring, it cost $29.84.

21:18.781 --> 21:27.272
Well, I

21:18.781 --> 21:27.272
have a request for you to consider. Whenever you 
decide that you want to part with those, please

21:28.493 --> 21:38.245
pass them on to the archives in the Cushing Library 
where they would be preserved forever. I'd be very

21:39.237 --> 21:41.641
surprised if they didn't have it already. Well, 
but they don't have, you'd be surprised at how some

21:41.721 --> 21:47.189
of that stuff. If they don't have it, they're 
welcome to. Because they'd love to. That question

21:51.815 --> 21:59.707
that you asked me, I warned you that I might get off 
on a track. No, that's good. What was that original

22:01.730 --> 22:03.713
question again? It was about what the scholarship 
consisted of. Well, you answered that yourself.

22:10.207 --> 22:14.732
In those days, where did you get the books? 
Physically, where were they? We got them from old

22:16.794 --> 22:19.598
Army Luke. The procedure was that you went down to 
the athletic department. Bones Urban was the AD at

22:25.324 --> 22:29.189
that time. And Dog Dawson was the assistant AD for 
business matters, I'll call it. and you went down

22:35.498 --> 22:43.891
to Dog's office and you got a chit from Dog and you 
took that chit up to H.L. Heaton's registrar

22:43.931 --> 22:58.093
office and you said, Mr. Heaton, here it is and he 
would make out a receipt like this and give it to you

22:43.931 --> 22:58.093
and Dog would also give you another chit and you 
would go up to J.E. Lupo, the old Army Lou's office

23:02.127 --> 23:08.416
only store at that time at Northgate, right next 
door to Doc Lipscomb's drugstore. And you'd say,

23:08.436 --> 23:10.399
hoo-ah! And you'd hear a hoo-ah from the back and 
you'd take that chit up there and, Lou, I need to get

23:11.420 --> 23:18.851
some books. Yes, sir. What do you need? Here's my 
registration form. Give me the books that I need

23:25.700 --> 23:27.643
for these courses. And he'd produce them. And at 
the end of the semester, you'd turn the books back

23:32.300 --> 23:39.847
in, get a chip, take the chip back down to the 
Dawson, turn it in, athletic department would get

23:32.300 --> 23:39.847
credit for that. Now, back to getting here, when 
you arrived, how did you learn where your room was

23:39.867 --> 23:48.234
and what outfit you were in and so forth? I'd 
already been assigned that. I got a letter from

23:49.696 --> 24:00.045
Colonel Andy, which is in that book of letters and 
also in my scrapbooks, which are by your left elbow

23:49.696 --> 24:00.045
there, and it told everything that you should 
bring, the recommended things. And it said, don't

24:03.958 --> 24:06.601
worry about a whole lot of clothes. The Corps is 
going to take care of that. And they did. How long

24:10.547 --> 24:14.913
did it take after you got here to go get those 
clothes? How many? Well,

24:18.357 --> 24:30.133
I think about the next day after I got here, they 
took us over to the Corpsmaster, and we were issued

24:31.058 --> 24:33.001
the Army officer's uniforms. And then after that, 
I'll

24:34.322 --> 24:43.114
digress slightly. All of the athletic freshmen 
were housed on campus. Non-athletic freshmen

24:49.603 --> 24:55.210
were housed out at the Bryan Army Air Force Base 
annex. So you were the only freshman on campus? We

24:58.117 --> 25:01.640
were the only freshman on campus, and there's 
another tale to that. But for the first week, we had

25:02.381 --> 25:09.947
freshman orientation, and it was all done out at 
Bryan Annex. It wasn't logistically feasible to

25:10.548 --> 25:15.152
do two sets of... Oh, describe that. That's your 
orientation. We had freshman orientation out

25:18.835 --> 25:24.640
there, and basically what they did was give us a 
series of tests I mean, each high school forwarded

25:25.160 --> 25:38.820
your transcripts to the college, but at that time 
there was no standardized form of identifying

25:25.160 --> 25:38.820
students or what they could do. The degree of 
difficulty level of the courses they took in high

25:40.662 --> 25:54.542
school, some little one-room high schools would 
have different curricula from the larger high

25:40.662 --> 25:54.542
schools, such as the one that I went to. And we took 
tests for two or three days out there and we got

25:55.400 --> 26:05.393
acquainted with campusology, what we would be 
expected to know. We were issued a little booklet

26:05.453 --> 26:13.484
about four inches by six inches called the 
Cadence. And in there was the history of Texas A&M

26:15.486 --> 26:23.837
as well as pictures of all of the buildings on 
campus a description of the buildings, when they

26:24.357 --> 26:32.126
were built, and who they were named for, and you 
better, by God, remember that. And they

26:32.146 --> 26:34.609
emphasized that. Fortunately, there were no 
upperclassmen, pissheads, as we call the

26:34.689 --> 26:40.615
sophomores. They kept them away from us so we could 
concentrate on what we were out there for, and that

26:42.397 --> 26:51.107
was to learn what was expected of us at Texas A&M. 
And we started drilling right off, and I had a leg up

26:51.796 --> 26:59.864
because I'd done all that kind of stuff at Beaumont 
High. Our PE coach was a former Navy commander,

27:00.605 --> 27:17.483
World War II, and he gave us all of the manual of arms 
and the squads left, squads right, about face. We

27:17.503 --> 27:21.347
had all of that, so that was not a problem for me. A 
lot of the boys from the country, they didn't know

27:21.479 --> 27:28.631
their left foot from their right foot, and they had 
a little bit of difficulty. But the sophomores

27:28.651 --> 27:31.897
straightened them out a little bit later. So 
you're out there four days, then you come back. We

27:35.402 --> 27:37.706
went back and forth by bus every day. Oh, okay. How 
long was it before the upperclassmen got to the

27:39.329 --> 27:47.082
campus and you all got into the real world of being 
an Aggie freshman? They got here the week after we

27:47.247 --> 27:51.532
did, after our orientation was over. We reported 
something like the 7th of September, and the

27:52.153 --> 27:59.642
upperclassmen reported around the 14th or 15th. 
And of course, keep in mind, this was the first year

28:00.863 --> 28:16.242
that freshman athletes had lived on campus, and 
the regular freshman class was separated out to

28:16.863 --> 28:25.352
the air base, and that made it logistically 
difficult for the upperclassmen to find freshmen

28:16.863 --> 28:25.352
to harass. And the senior athletes made it known to 
the other upperclassmen very quickly, these are

28:27.374 --> 28:39.526
our freshmen, you keep your damn hands off of them. 
If anybody's going to beat ass, we're going to beat

28:39.546 --> 28:43.110
ass. Now, y'all were in what dorm? Hart Hall. 
Describe the routine, particularly your room,

28:46.816 --> 28:49.939
and what it was like. I lived in I-9 Hart Hall. Hart 
Hall was a

28:55.344 --> 29:04.873
U-shaped building with the bottom of the U 
truncated on both sides. It was

29:06.134 --> 29:14.022
three stories, and it had ramps. ramps A through I, 
and there was a stairwell going up the middle of

29:15.115 --> 29:33.843
each ramp, and there were two rooms on each side, 
no, four rooms on each side on each floor, and the

29:15.115 --> 29:33.843
rooms shared a bath. So that you're on the I ramp 
third floor? That's right. And... Who was your

29:43.752 --> 29:47.357
fish old lady and what? Initially, my fish old lady 
was Robert Schaefer, Buddy Schaefer, who was a

29:47.377 --> 29:57.071
football player and track man. And they just kind 
of threw us all into, they matched us up. They

30:04.982 --> 30:06.344
didn't do it alphabetically. I don't know what 
method Colonel Andy used for the track people, but

30:06.424 --> 30:12.713
he said, If you want to change roommates, if you 
know somebody from another town, you go right

30:12.946 --> 30:18.373
ahead. Just keep me informed so I'll know where you 
are. And then he asked me later on, after about

30:21.998 --> 30:34.774
three or four days rooming with Buddy, Buddy had 
found a hometown buddy that he'd prefer to room

30:21.998 --> 30:34.774
with. And Colonel Landy asked me if I would like to 
room with his son, Wally.

30:46.308 --> 30:47.970
And I said, well, sure. So Wally and I started out 
rooming together for a couple of three weeks. And

30:53.857 --> 31:08.674
then a hometown friend of mine who was a sophomore, 
Walter Evans, he had been a football and track

30:53.857 --> 31:08.674
teammate for my high school. And he, his daddy, was 
a car dealer. And Walter would bring an old clunker

31:15.923 --> 31:21.626
used car off of his daddy's car to school. And since 
we were from the same hometown,
