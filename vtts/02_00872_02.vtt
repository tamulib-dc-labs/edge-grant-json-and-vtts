WEBVTT

00:01.313 --> 00:17.247
which can't because I wasn't even involved in 
transit planning at the time, was they looked like

00:01.313 --> 00:17.247
very different beasts in the way that they were 
perceived in the public and all just a matter of

00:01.313 --> 00:17.247
perception. What the issue was in this particular 
referendum was there was a fat line on a map that was

00:19.589 --> 00:30.139
a heavy rail and it only served certain areas And it 
was not clear to a lot of people how the other areas

00:30.710 --> 00:40.001
would be served and actually would benefit from 
the system, the concept being that this is our

00:30.710 --> 00:40.001
heaviest corridor. This is where we could achieve 
significant savings by putting in a capital

00:40.021 --> 00:54.499
intensive facility that would result in 
operation savings and feed the rest of the system

00:40.021 --> 00:54.499
into this, serve the same activity centers that 
need to be served. Dallas, on the other hand, came

00:56.821 --> 01:00.666
out proposing a huge system covering their entire 
region, showing what they would like to see it look

01:01.270 --> 01:05.333
like at build out. And I think did a much better job 
of showing the full comprehensive system. That's

01:11.739 --> 01:15.462
not to say that Metro didn't have a full 
comprehensive system in mind. There was no way we

01:15.502 --> 01:25.030
could not have had to be in line with the 
alternatives analysis procedures that the Urban

01:15.502 --> 01:25.030
Mass Transportation Administration requires. 
You have to do an incredibly detailed level of work

01:25.731 --> 01:31.075
on your operating plan, how it will affect your 
system. So the planning had been done. It was just,

01:36.404 --> 01:38.327
I think, presented differently. And it looks a lot 
different. To my mind, that was a lot of the voter

01:43.574 --> 01:58.395
reaction, was that we were just showing a segment 
serving the middle class area, when in fact, we

01:43.574 --> 01:58.395
were just showing a fixed guideway there and 
potentials another. What that led to was going

01:59.776 --> 02:09.710
back to the drawing board, refining the plans some 
more to reflect, obviously, what the voters

01:59.776 --> 02:09.710
didn't want. So the board worked with staff, 
proposed several systems. The board eventually

02:15.338 --> 02:26.374
got down to considering alternatives A, B, and C, 
which were rail-intensive systems, or bus-only

02:15.338 --> 02:26.374
systems, or primarily bus systems with where some 
segments of rail were justified, where we could

02:26.962 --> 02:31.850
get operational savings. That option C was 
selected. And that's what you see here on this

02:34.434 --> 02:37.539
regional transit plan map. And it pretty much just 
shows you where the fixed guideways are, our

02:38.320 --> 02:43.248
proposals for fixed guideways. You see the 
various corridors. We discussed early

02:46.052 --> 02:53.003
transitways in Gulf Freeway, in the North 
Freeway. along 290, the Northwest Freeway, I-10,

02:53.793 --> 03:11.040
and 59, showing other proposals we discussed 
before, future extensions on East X-59 North, 288

02:53.793 --> 03:11.040
South, and just a variety of other corridors that 
look like fixed guideways would be needed. This is

03:11.120 --> 03:14.465
the Fort Worth and Denver Railroad right-of-way. 
That is a good direct access to the 1960 area, and

03:14.926 --> 03:21.336
use of that corridor would would give us a good 
commute. It looks like it's going out to Tumble.

03:28.548 --> 03:31.172
Yeah, it's just to that whole 1960 area. This would 
provide you several alternatives to funnel

03:31.332 --> 03:35.959
traffic into the major activities. The stars you 
see here are proposed major transit centers using

03:35.979 --> 03:49.821
sort of the airline hubbing concept to feed you 
into a hub and then offer you alternatives to get to

03:35.979 --> 03:49.821
other areas. For example, Northwest traffic 
being funneled into the Northwest Transit

03:50.172 --> 04:04.154
Center, which will be developed at the site of the 
intersection of the West Loop 16 and I-10 West.

04:04.174 --> 04:11.024
We've acquired the site to build that facility and 
are working on designing it at this point. The

04:11.104 --> 04:15.231
others proposed, of course, downtown is 
considered a major transfer center. The South

04:16.032 --> 04:17.935
Rice Transit Center at 59, the Southwest Freeway, 
and the West Loop 610. And this was originally

04:22.498 --> 04:28.344
proposed further out on the West Park system. The 
concept has been revised a lot since then. This was

04:32.569 --> 04:34.371
adopted. The option C was adopted by the board. The 
board recommended that staff go back and

04:37.575 --> 04:46.825
reevaluate some particular areas that they 
thought needed very close attention. So the

04:47.497 --> 04:52.705
Regional Transit Plan is adopted after sincere 
study. It was adopted in 1986, March of 86. In its

04:57.612 --> 05:04.983
pretty much final form, you can see how there is 
some difference in the way the guideways are

04:57.612 --> 05:04.983
defined. An additional regional transit center, 
the concept being that the routes will now have

05:05.584 --> 05:14.618
sub-regional transit centers that will serve 
neighborhoods. route you into one and give you

05:14.750 --> 05:19.216
express buses to different locations. And the 
fixed guideways have been looked at, refined

05:19.236 --> 05:25.465
somewhat. One of the major revisions to the 
refining the regional plan was the east side

05:26.887 --> 05:33.436
improvements. A lot of discussion of the equity 
issue that the east end is primarily a minority and

05:33.456 --> 05:43.170
low-moderate income area, a Hispanic 
neighborhood. in the south of the Ship Channel and

05:43.808 --> 05:52.677
primarily a black and Hispanic mixed 
neighborhood in the northeast side of Houston. So

05:52.697 --> 05:55.279
a great deal of analysis went in there. A task force 
was created composed of Metro staff members and

05:55.300 --> 06:08.653
community representatives that worked long and 
hard, held public meetings, had a lot of sessions

05:55.300 --> 06:08.653
in defining it. And the conclusion of that task 
force that the best way to serve the East End

06:14.234 --> 06:31.253
remains with a very good, solid bus system that 
routes you into transit centers,

06:14.234 --> 06:31.253
shown here, and gets you to a system connector 
proposed for phase two that would get you to the

06:14.234 --> 06:31.253
major activity centers. So this has been adopted. 
This is the regional transit plan, which the

06:32.555 --> 06:36.459
authority is operating under at this point. And as 
you can see, we're under construction the outer

06:42.550 --> 06:46.714
reaches of the system on the guideways. By the end 
of our first phase of the plan, which is a five-year

06:46.774 --> 07:04.172
plan in 1991, we will have completed 69 miles of 
transitways and freeway rights of ways on the

06:46.774 --> 07:04.172
Gulf, North, Northeast, and Katy and Southwest 
freeways. And phase two of the plan, to be built out

07:05.173 --> 07:10.819
by year 2000, is we refer to as the system 
connector, which is a transit corridor we've

07:11.693 --> 07:19.841
identified in a loop shape in the inner city area. 
And a lot of our recent study that's summarized in

07:21.463 --> 07:34.156
this report called Building a Regional System is 
examination of how this phase two system will be

07:21.463 --> 07:34.156
done, what will be done in phase three, how it will 
tie into phase one. So what you have is, in phase

07:34.797 --> 07:40.823
one, the development of a lot of your base 
facilities, the transitways, the major transit

07:42.052 --> 07:53.728
centers, the minor transit centers in the 
neighborhoods, expanding the bus fleet,

07:42.052 --> 07:53.728
expanding the route system, building new bus 
maintenance facilities to keep up with demand.

07:55.851 --> 08:09.510
Phase two becomes the system connector, looking 
at how to connect the major transit centers and the

07:55.851 --> 08:09.510
transit ways and the activity centers to 
implementation of that phase two gives us a full

08:09.980 --> 08:12.163
regional system. It gives you the ability to go in a 
reasonably timely fashion from one point in the

08:12.184 --> 08:22.560
metro region to another point. And I just say 
reasonably because you have to consider the size

08:23.441 --> 08:27.788
of the area we're serving. It's a huge area. You 
know, almost equivalent to the, well, it's a good

08:30.702 --> 08:36.732
portion of Harris County. So it's huge. At some 
point, it's 50 miles in width. So it's a huge system

08:39.516 --> 08:41.439
to serve. Yeah, Ephraim was saying that the ETJ is 
bigger than the state of Delaware. It's probably

08:48.370 --> 08:52.677
in excess of, what, 1,200 square miles now, 
probably more than that. Our system isn't as large

08:55.087 --> 08:58.291
as the ETJ. It isn't the same configuration as the 
ETJ. I don't know how the square mileage compares.

09:06.342 --> 09:17.798
Any of the technologies that we're looking at for 
the second phase, the system connector, would be

09:06.342 --> 09:17.798
interchangeable like the system you were 
describing. We already operate the system of

09:19.300 --> 09:23.085
offering monthly passes or individual fares. And 
with the transfer, an individual fare allows you

09:27.403 --> 09:36.575
one transfer to an additional bus to complete your 
trip.

09:40.200 --> 09:53.578
When we're looking at fixed guidelines like a 
light rail system at grade or a completely grade

09:40.200 --> 09:53.578
separated light rail system or an elevated bus way 
that's completely grade separated, which are the

09:53.980 --> 10:09.577
three capital systems we looked at, or system 
connector, you would be able to move from the bus

09:53.980 --> 10:09.577
system to that without paying an additional fare, 
or vice versa, to move either direction and be able

09:53.980 --> 10:09.577
to transfer without a cost. OK. Mike, has there 
been any serious discussion here at Metro of the

10:11.098 --> 10:22.350
perennially discussed triangle for a rail 
transit between San Antonio, Houston, and

10:23.309 --> 10:29.235
Dallas. I think there's probably been some 
discussion. I don't know much about it. I'm

10:35.668 --> 10:37.029
familiar with the system. Does it periodically 
appear in the press and that sort of thing, and then

10:37.490 --> 10:42.736
one never hears anything more about it? It was 
discussed again. The marketing rep for it made a

10:43.917 --> 10:56.472
presentation at the APA conference in El Paso last 
fall and described the system and their proposed

10:43.917 --> 10:56.472
location for their terminal in Houston.

10:57.852 --> 11:01.055
But there wasn't any discussion of local system 
interface. Their proposed location of their

11:02.617 --> 11:12.367
station would not allow us to directly interface 
with our proposed alignment. That would be a

11:12.388 --> 11:15.411
killing thing if it didn't. And this is what BART is 
facing now in San Francisco. They should have

11:20.036 --> 11:25.041
purchased the Southern Pacific right-of-way 
which would enable them to go from CBD to the

11:25.645 --> 11:40.152
airport directly, rather than going all the way 
out to the beach practically, and then back down

11:25.645 --> 11:40.152
through very difficult terrain in Daly City to the 
airport, which is what they're contemplating

11:25.645 --> 11:40.152
doing. Really? And it would make the trip about 
three times as long in time as it really should be.

11:49.051 --> 12:02.471
We don't include a direct line or a fixed guideway 
system to either Hobby or Intercontinental

11:49.051 --> 12:02.471
airports in our planning through phase three. We 
believe basing a lot, of course basing our whole

12:04.253 --> 12:17.573
system on ridership and the kind of facilities 
needed to offer a viable alternative to the

12:04.253 --> 12:17.573
automobile, which relates to how congested is a 
particular roadway. Does that congestion

12:21.159 --> 12:28.106
warrant putting us out and building us in our own 
exclusive right of way? With the regional

12:28.907 --> 12:46.767
mobility plan going into effect, a lot of that 
being implemented, the implementation of Hardy

12:28.907 --> 12:46.767
Toll

12:28.907 --> 12:46.767
Road would provide excellent access, the 
extension of the North Freeway bus transit way.

12:47.287 --> 12:53.801
which we're working on now on the environmental 
assessment and the cost-effectiveness

12:47.287 --> 12:53.801
evaluations. And we already have grant funding 
from Urban Mass Transit Administration in place

12:53.861 --> 13:01.819
to help build that facility, and we have capital 
set aside to match that grant, we'll have that

13:02.609 --> 13:07.680
system extended all the way out to 1960. And so that 
will provide an exclusive guideway to that

13:08.462 --> 13:12.491
facility. With that, and potentially eventually 
building a facility on the Eastex freeway, we'll

13:12.531 --> 13:21.411
have a lot of alternatives to get to the airport. 
And Intercontinental just could best be served

13:22.015 --> 13:31.527
using bus, even express bus, if the demand's there 
on Hardy Tell Road to Intercontinental. That's

13:31.868 --> 13:33.009
the best service there. We already serve Hobby 
directly, our Belford bus. We have a couple of

13:36.874 --> 13:37.996
buses. I think it's the Belford Crosstown drives 
through the Hobby garage to the drop off porch at

13:38.016 --> 13:47.768
Hobby. So we're already providing some service. 
It's not express service. But that demand doesn't

13:52.171 --> 13:55.959
really seem to show itself. We're having biome to 
requirements to address the corridors that are

13:55.999 --> 14:02.072
the most congested. And that always brings us back 
to this corridor that's embodied in the system

14:02.793 --> 14:09.066
connector corridor. where all these activity 
centers are in close proximity to each other. This

14:14.886 --> 14:24.614
system connector, now the board is mulling over 
some various alternatives that would link it to

14:14.886 --> 14:24.614
the Texas Medical Center. And then further down to 
the Astro Domain area, which is the Astro Dome,

14:25.735 --> 14:33.722
Astro World, that area. And then with an extension 
eventually running over to the area where we're

14:41.480 --> 14:48.349
building the southeast transit center to serve 
east side patrons. So that would give us a good

14:48.369 --> 14:49.470
link. Then in phase three, we would look at this 
Fort Worth and Denver cart going up to 1960. When

14:55.658 --> 15:02.847
you use the term guideway, what exactly does that 
mean? Okay. The guideway itself can be any kind of

15:04.639 --> 15:09.425
guideway that's an exclusive right-of-way for a 
transit vehicle. The bus transitways that exist

15:10.145 --> 15:15.252
down the North Freeway and the Katy Freeway are 
transit guideways. The proposals for Phase 2 of

15:15.833 --> 15:30.471
the plan, the system connector, again, we're 
grade-separated rail, and it's exclusive

15:15.833 --> 15:30.471
right-of-way, either elevated or subway, and 
completely removed from traffic, no conflicts.

15:31.244 --> 15:54.383
um a system a busway alternative which has an 
exclusive bus guideway elevated in the southern

15:31.244 --> 15:54.383
part of this along the southwest freeway and then 
with ramps into the downtown area and an automated

15:31.244 --> 15:54.383
guideway transit facility going through the post 
oak area a driverless train that we go from

15:54.768 --> 16:00.154
Northwest Transit Center, down to the South Rise 
Transit Center. That was the second alternative

16:00.174 --> 16:03.117
we've evaluated. The third is an alternative 
called a light rail alternative. It's at grade,

16:09.624 --> 16:22.378
street level light rail, such as Portland or the 
Muni system on the streets in San Francisco or a

16:09.624 --> 16:22.378
variety of other systems. It's a popular 
technology that's proven to be real economical.

16:26.855 --> 16:31.279
That system run in San Diego, Tijuana Trolling. 
Yeah, very similar kind of technology. It's

16:35.063 --> 16:36.545
powered by overhead wires. We would be in our own 
exclusive right of way running down Main Street

16:37.506 --> 16:46.515
with a transit mall on Main Street, which is 
proposed for all of our alternatives. Then it

16:47.235 --> 16:49.918
would go out, transition, go through Midtown and 
go into Richmond Avenue and east-west

16:50.219 --> 17:12.150
thoroughfare, run along Richmond, transition 
into West Park and run to the South Rice Transit

16:50.219 --> 17:12.150
Center, then run up through the Post Oak Galleria 
area on Post Oak Boulevard and then along the edge

16:50.219 --> 17:12.150
of the loop, 610 west into this transit center. 
That would provide for some future extensions to

17:12.651 --> 17:18.319
other areas. as the grade-separated rail or the 
busway would. The other alternatives we consider

17:21.481 --> 17:34.708
are a very close examination of the TSM, or 
transportation system management, which is

17:21.481 --> 17:34.708
making do with the existing street system and 
using relative low cost. Even still, that

17:35.529 --> 17:37.894
alternative includes the automated driverless 
train, the AGT for Post Oak, just because of the

17:38.178 --> 17:44.686
congestion factors. We can never serve that area 
well with buses given the projections that we

17:44.726 --> 17:52.675
have. And of course, the final alternative in the 
UMTA alternatives analysis is the no action

17:52.695 --> 17:59.423
alternative. So staff has spent the past year 
working on evaluating these different

17:59.443 --> 18:06.852
alternatives Their recommendation to the board 
of directors was that the street level light rail

18:07.270 --> 18:32.623
system be chosen as the alternative, given the 
fact that the cost of the system compared to the

18:07.270 --> 18:32.623
efficiencies it provides gives us the best system 
and still gives us adequate operation time. And

18:33.144 --> 18:36.889
because the way the system can be financed 
compared to more expensive Great Separated Rail

18:37.308 --> 18:39.050
or Busway. It allows us to do these other 
extensions that I mentioned before earlier than

18:39.691 --> 18:45.078
we could have otherwise. Move some extensions of 
the system, like to the Texas Medical Center and

18:45.198 --> 18:54.371
Southeast Transit Center, into Phase 2 instead of 
deferring them to Phase 3. And the board's

18:55.152 --> 19:06.707
considering the system now, looking at some 
alternatives to it and refining it, maybe

18:55.152 --> 19:06.707
considering moving the Harrisburg corridor that 
serves East End in early, although That's just

19:07.649 --> 19:08.931
speculation. And that alternative appears to be 
the best. They're considering that at the end of

19:13.396 --> 19:15.559
July 87. They're supposed to give us some 
direction on what they think is the most valid. And

19:22.348 --> 19:31.619
that time, we'll begin developing a draft 
environmental impact statement of that system,

19:22.348 --> 19:31.619
doing all the cost effectiveness evaluation that 
UMTA requires. And approximately a year after

19:32.561 --> 19:34.483
that, be in shape to say whether it's actually the 
best system or not. The draft environmental

19:40.441 --> 19:44.326
impact statement will continue the evaluation of 
all the alternatives. You're going to be busy.

19:47.410 --> 19:47.730
Yeah. It's an amazing system. I've worked here for 
a year, I guess a year and a week. And it's just been

19:52.577 --> 19:55.901
amazing, the workload that's put on. Especially 
given, amazingly enough, or maybe not even

19:55.961 --> 20:04.673
surprisingly, the change in the economy made the 
job much more difficult. We had to contract with

20:06.546 --> 20:12.395
HGAC to revise the population projections. 
Because those all go into our modeling, figuring

20:14.718 --> 20:18.925
out ridership, and how everything's formatted. 
And that's a very difficult job to do. Data of that

20:23.872 --> 20:33.867
magnitude, demographic data, here goes through a 
thing called the Interagency Database Task

20:23.872 --> 20:33.867
Force. that reviews all the projections and 
representatives from all the major agencies and

20:34.420 --> 20:41.868
organizations that are users of that data. 
Highway department, the city, the metro, the

20:42.468 --> 20:49.455
county, all agree and adopt that particular 
information. So all that information had to be

20:49.475 --> 20:51.057
down. Yeah, Ephraim mentioned that. And it was 
interesting to hear that there is that level of

20:53.900 --> 21:02.689
cooperation, because there isn't even that level 
of cooperation within the agencies of the state

21:02.855 --> 21:06.639
government in Boston. They usually come out with 
two forecasts. Really? That review is very

21:11.725 --> 21:14.468
comfortable. I think it's a very valid thing to do. 
Sure. It sounds like the way to go. The most

21:20.274 --> 21:30.545
qualified people are there examining it, and I 
think it really gives it a lot of forethought goes

21:20.274 --> 21:30.545
into the projections. We ended up, of course, we 
had a down grade our revenue forecast because of

21:32.875 --> 21:38.277
sales tax problems. Oh, yeah.
