00:06.697 --> 00:24.378
So

00:06.697 --> 00:24.378
when you're told that over and over and over and 
over again, how much people disapprove of what

00:06.697 --> 00:24.378
you're doing, after a while, you really don't care 
to do that anymore.

00:26.481 --> 00:28.723
So for a lot of guys, it was a mental trip. They 
didn't

00:28.763 --> 00:33.649
want to be there anymore. Okay. Tell me about what 
it was like when you came home. How did people react

00:39.953 --> 00:57.180
when you told them you fought in Vietnam?

00:57.561 --> 00:58.843
I was real, you know, I always got such a sense of 
pride when my dad said, I fought in World War II, you

01:00.916 --> 01:07.964
know, and I fought in Korea. I, well, I just, you 
know, I just, you know, swell up inside with pride

01:08.304 --> 01:15.873
for what he had done. And even today you tell 
people, well, you know, I fought in Vietnam and

01:16.994 --> 01:24.443
it's, it's like, big deal. Who cares? Oh, you were 
over there in all that mess? Well, to me it wasn't a

01:31.845 --> 01:35.549
mess.

01:41.216 --> 01:48.545
A fear that I have is,

01:41.216 --> 01:48.545
I have a real fear of communism. I have never lived 
in a communistic society But I've seen the results

01:55.355 --> 01:58.819
of communism. I've been to North Vietnam, and I 
would not want my kids to grow up like that. Always

02:08.929 --> 02:10.611
fear and fear.

02:16.877 --> 02:19.980
I think we lost the war because of an attitude. If we 
wanted to have

02:25.274 --> 02:37.231
If we wanted to have won, we would have,

02:25.274 --> 02:37.231
regardless of the cost.

02:38.232 --> 02:54.876
I would have

02:38.232 --> 02:54.876
almost did and would have died in Vietnam if I knew 
that it would have helped to stamp out something

02:38.232 --> 02:54.876
that I don't believe in. I guess the American 
public has lost its beliefs. Tell me some more

03:02.100 --> 03:07.108
about when you came home, reactions of people. You 
were telling me about Veterans Day here at A&M.

03:14.039 --> 03:22.112
Well,

03:14.039 --> 03:22.112
my dad, he said that he used to... that everybody 
used to wear their uniform on Veterans Day and on

03:23.105 --> 03:28.032
Memorial Day. And it used to be a real time

03:28.192 --> 03:40.208
to remember what people fought for. And I wore my 
uniform last

03:41.350 --> 03:50.142
Memorial Day. And I

03:52.855 --> 03:59.023
didn't see anybody else. There was no sense of 
anybody else being proud of. I know a lot of Vietnam

04:03.909 --> 04:08.735
vets. There's no sense of pride in what they've 
done. That time I went to Washington, DC, there was

04:13.201 --> 04:18.868
a guy sitting in a wheelchair. He'd lost both of his 
legs in Vietnam. And this little girl, I bet you she

04:22.437 --> 04:28.563
wasn't over 16 years old, she walked over with a 
pole. She had a long pole with a rope hanging down.

04:32.968 --> 04:37.652
And there was a baby, a doll, hanging on the end of 
that pole. And they had taken a match or whatever

04:39.715 --> 04:44.580
and scorched that doll all up. And she threw that 
thing in his lap.

04:50.872 --> 04:53.615
and said, remember this?

04:57.218 --> 04:59.381
She has absolutely no idea. The guy goes over there 
and loses both of his legs so that she can go out in

04:59.421 --> 05:07.909
the streets and demonstrate.

05:11.573 --> 05:15.056
And there was no appreciation at all. And that is 
the most aggravating thing. When I, the deal about

05:19.627 --> 05:40.897
Texas A&M, I walked into a

05:19.627 --> 05:40.897
literature class and a

05:19.627 --> 05:40.897
guy, I never killed a baby when I was in Vietnam. How 
this thing about baby killers came about, I don't

05:41.157 --> 05:45.583
know. Kids were killed in World War II. Do we go 
around calling the World War II vets baby killers?

05:53.068 --> 05:56.093
And there were orphanages bombed and things like 
that in World War II. Accidents happen, but that's

05:57.334 --> 06:00.559
the cost of war. And when you got a guy, a freshman in 
college, walking up to me and calling me a baby

06:01.860 --> 06:13.536
killer, it makes me want to go into a, I would just 
like to bash his face in, because he doesn't know

06:01.860 --> 06:13.536
what he's talking about. I never killed a baby. in 
Vietnam. I killed a whole bunch of people that were

06:17.244 --> 06:20.549
trying to kill me. But I never killed a baby.

06:29.501 --> 06:37.633
So they've locked us into a group and said, all of 
you guys are like this. It's frustrating. You get

06:41.698 --> 06:44.342
this sense of you want to scream and tell people

06:48.625 --> 06:53.753
Based on what you experienced, what do you think of 
our involvement in Southeast Asia?

06:56.877 --> 06:59.021
Do you think it was right or wrong? What are your 
feelings on it? Well, I think any time a government

07:01.905 --> 07:12.741
reaches out, we have always been there for people 
that have asked for our help. If we stop,

07:17.026 --> 07:30.372
If we had stopped in Vietnam, if we had told the 
Vietnamese people, oh, I'm really sorry, we just

07:17.026 --> 07:30.372
can't get involved, you're just going to have to 
sell this yourself, then we have lost every idea

07:17.026 --> 07:30.372
that this country was based on. I'm a patriot, I 
guess, from the soles of my feet up. If we start and

07:40.229 --> 08:04.393
say, oh, no, just like what we had done just now, we 
have decided, our government has decided, or we

07:40.229 --> 08:04.393
have some people in the House that have decided 
that

07:40.229 --> 08:04.393
we're not going to continue democracy

07:40.229 --> 08:04.393
in the world. They just showed us that by not giving 
aid

08:12.427 --> 08:16.933
in Central America, militarily or financially, 
whatever. When we stop

08:18.134 --> 08:26.424
spreading democracy, communism comes in. We gave 
up and we quit because of pressures of a few people

08:27.406 --> 08:33.013
in Vietnam. And what happened? Now the whole 
country is communist. If we give up, and allow

08:40.203 --> 08:42.125
communism to spread. It's just like a cancer. It's 
going to spread pretty soon. We're

08:45.168 --> 08:51.916
not going to be able to hold it back of our own back 
doors. And it's going to come in. If we let it spread

08:55.660 --> 09:03.308
in Central America, it's going to spread just like 
it has done in Asia, just like it's done in Vietnam.

09:04.429 --> 09:08.033
We stopped it in Korea.

09:08.570 --> 09:10.733
It's a stalemate in Korea.

09:16.460 --> 09:22.207
And if we let it, I think our involvement was 
justified, to answer your question.

09:27.874 --> 09:36.805
Because we didn't finish our job,

09:27.874 --> 09:36.805
I think that hurts. But it's like all those guys 
that died, those 55,000 guys, and some of them were

09:38.337 --> 09:51.370
good friends of mine,

09:38.337 --> 09:51.370
died for nothing because we did not finish what we 
set out to do.

09:54.613 --> 09:57.256
How have your views changed since the end of the 
war, or have they? They're the same. I'm still a

10:01.380 --> 10:02.201
patriot. I still believe in democracy.

10:07.261 --> 10:20.454
If my government said tomorrow, Bob, we need you to 
go to Central America to fight against communist

10:07.261 --> 10:20.454
aggression,

10:07.261 --> 10:20.454
my bags would be packed and I'd be ready to go.

10:28.001 --> 10:30.023
Did you ever question why you were in Vietnam? One 
time. When was that? after I had been shot.

10:40.074 --> 10:43.721
But I think anybody would question. But once they 
patched me up and I was okay, I think if you're at the

10:50.258 --> 10:55.303
steps of death, you're always going to question no 
matter where you are. If you're speeding down the

10:56.164 --> 11:04.032
road and you hit a telephone pole and you're laying 
there and you're dying, you're going to question,

10:56.164 --> 11:04.032
well, why was I speeding?

11:08.116 --> 11:10.138
I question, what am I doing here? But as soon as I got 
okay, I knew why I was there. And I was helping

11:16.769 --> 11:25.904
people that asked for help, because they don't 
want to live under

11:16.769 --> 11:25.904
communist rule. That's why I was there. And I 
questioned the one time, but after that I didn't

11:29.250 --> 11:33.517
ever again. And I still don't to this day. I still 
believe.

11:39.507 --> 11:40.268
I put it off. I put off the takeover. as long and as 
well as I could. I

11:48.348 --> 11:55.315
did what I could do, and I'm satisfied with that. 
Okay, well, thank you for your time. Okay. In

12:01.761 --> 12:12.291
general, can you tell me about how the American 
soldiers felt about the Vietnamese all through

12:01.761 --> 12:12.291
the war and up until the time of the pullout?

12:12.777 --> 12:16.021
Not only was there a job to do, but there was also a 
caring. It's just like anywhere. You see somebody

12:20.227 --> 12:22.931
in trouble, and people care about people.

12:28.438 --> 12:41.215
So many times, you see GIs just taking kids out of a 
fire area, risking their lives to help the

12:28.438 --> 12:41.215
Vietnamese people. Even in the pullout, the Army 
could have just left, but they tried to get as many

12:41.802 --> 12:55.763
people as they could out of South Vietnam. I mean, 
just as many people as they could get out, they got

12:56.023 --> 13:00.049
out. The dumping of helicopters over the side, 
personal effects were thrown overboard.

13:09.629 --> 13:18.317
just so they could cram one more person on board 
ship to bring them to freedom and democracy. So

13:18.437 --> 13:28.225
there was a real caring, a sense of caring between 
the military and the Vietnamese people. I think

13:28.666 --> 13:39.315
that's, if the people that were demonstrating in 
the days of the Vietnamese War, if they could have

13:28.666 --> 13:39.315
seen, if they would have taken the time to look 
through on their political minds,

13:41.236 --> 13:57.618
they could have seen that the GI and the South 
Vietnamese people had relationships. They had a

13:57.818 --> 14:00.662
caring, they cared about each other. And if they 
would have looked at that, maybe it would have

14:01.703 --> 14:09.133
softened a lot of hearts the attitudes would have 
changed. Why do you think Saigon fell? Well,

14:17.777 --> 14:19.018
because we pulled out. Why

14:19.058 --> 14:29.328
has Lebanon fallen? Because Israel was pulling 
out. Eventually, the Muslims are going to be in

14:35.514 --> 14:40.099
complete control of what's going on there Same 
thing in Vietnam. We pulled out what was left

14:42.631 --> 14:48.720
to defend. And a lot of people, a lot of people have 
died since we pulled out just because they were

14:50.983 --> 14:58.973
friends to us.

15:02.578 --> 15:06.143
And why did we pull out? Because of pressure on... 
That's what I said earlier, because of pressure of

15:10.117 --> 15:15.462
the...

15:16.763 --> 15:22.888
In my opinion, the private sector needs to keep 
their nose out of the military business. Of course

15:23.489 --> 15:28.853
we've got our guys going over there to fight, but 
that's what they're in the military for. People

15:29.634 --> 15:31.676
know what they're doing when they join the 
military. It's not just to get a paycheck. It's to

15:35.819 --> 15:37.441
defend them. You might end up dying. That's the 
whole idea of having a military. The private

15:43.801 --> 15:53.770
sector, our Congress, even all the way up to the 
president,

15:43.801 --> 15:53.770
need to leave the military to military business. 
If the military was able to stay in Vietnam, who

15:55.872 --> 16:04.681
knows what would it be like today? Or if we had had 
enough

16:17.988 --> 16:29.622
What I want to say

16:17.988 --> 16:29.622
is if we had had enough dedication in what we were 
doing as the communists had in what they were

16:17.988 --> 16:29.622
doing, we would have won that war.

16:32.466 --> 16:34.869
The communists, they had that idea set into their 
minds. And no matter what was going to happen, they

16:34.929 --> 16:40.115
were going to fight for what they believed in. We 
stopped believing in what we were fighting for.

16:48.582 --> 17:07.924
A lot of Vietnam vets are protesting now about why 
they were there and asking for aid because a lot of

16:48.582 --> 17:07.924
them are having mental problems now and many have 
cancer and stuff and are saying that's caused from

16:48.582 --> 17:07.924
Agent Orange that was used to defoliate the 
jungles. How do you feel about all that? Does that

17:11.268 --> 17:14.572
show some sort of a... I think these guys need to...

17:21.050 --> 17:39.654
The Vietnam

17:21.050 --> 17:39.654
vet that was wounded in serving his country, I 
believe, has a legitimate claim.

17:41.096 --> 17:48.205
But a lot of the guys

17:53.197 --> 17:56.822
Like the dope thing in Vietnam. The dope problem in 
Vietnam was a choice that you could make. If you

18:02.531 --> 18:09.601
made that choice to get all strung out on dope, then 
that was your business. That's a choice that you

18:10.222 --> 18:11.404
made. Now, our government should not have to pay 
for that. Now, the Agent Orange thing, I'm not a

18:16.571 --> 18:22.680
chemist, so I don't know what effects Agent Orange 
had on on our guys.

18:29.931 --> 18:35.699
That one,

18:29.931 --> 18:35.699
I think a lot of guys are probably looking for a free 
ride. I was probably eligible for a disability.

18:46.453 --> 18:47.414
I would not accept it. What for? Just to, you know, 
I'm able to get out there and make a living. I was in

18:54.720 --> 18:56.681
North Vietnam for 18 months. A lot of these guys sat 
back in a foxhole, stuck their gun up out of the

18:57.562 --> 19:03.848
foxhole without even ever looking out of it and 
just pulled the trigger. And now they want federal

19:04.588 --> 19:07.291
aid from the federal government? Well, that's a 
bunch of baloney. They need to start standing up

19:09.093 --> 19:16.839
like a man again and go to work and make a living 
instead of trying to take a free ride from our

19:09.093 --> 19:16.839
government. That's not fair.

19:23.039 --> 19:29.909
that you are proud of what you did and the time that 
you spent and are proud of the job that you did?

19:32.433 --> 19:34.916
Yeah. Yeah, I am. When I say I'm a Vietnam vet, I 
don't hang my head down when I say it. And that's,

19:45.832 --> 19:51.460
you know, a lot of guys do now because of the way 
they've been treated. I

19:52.739 --> 20:01.049
thought I fought for what I thought was right, and 
nobody can take that away from me. If somebody

20:02.050 --> 20:07.597
wants to make an outlandish statement, the way I 
look at it is they don't know what they're talking

20:02.050 --> 20:07.597
about. If you were to have a message to the college 
students of today to try to justify or clear up the

20:10.200 --> 20:22.695
misconceptions you feel like they have, what 
would that message be?

20:26.405 --> 20:30.289
Don't judge everything by what you hear. I think 
they would really have had to have been there to

20:30.309 --> 20:39.978
make a judgment. Anything else?

20:46.224 --> 20:51.990
What would you tell them as far as if they were 
needed to defend the country, what would your?

20:53.607 --> 20:57.111
your message to them be as far as whether they 
should or shouldn't?

21:04.078 --> 21:23.378
Well, my attitude is probably a little different, 
but I would say if your country, you know, this

21:04.078 --> 21:23.378
country gives you everything that you've got, you 
know, and if we don't, if each individual doesn't

21:04.078 --> 21:23.378
really weigh it and say, I'm not willing to give up, 
the way of life that I have, my liberty and my

21:24.218 --> 21:33.666
democratic society, my pursuit of happiness or 
whatever. If they're not willing to make a stand

21:35.127 --> 21:54.023
and fight for their freedoms,

21:35.127 --> 21:54.023
like the guys that went to Canada during the 
Vietnam War, I do not think that they should have

21:35.127 --> 21:54.023
ever been given a right to come back here. You know, 
because they want to turn tail. And of course, they

21:57.528 --> 22:04.414
don't mind receiving all the things that this 
country has to offer. But when the country turns

22:05.035 --> 22:16.225
around and says, well, you know, we need your help 
now, if you want to turn tail and run, as far as I'm

22:05.035 --> 22:16.225
concerned, you might as well just keep on running 
and go on. You know, it's like the people that want a

22:17.066 --> 22:19.788
socialistic government. If you want a 
socialistic government, go live in Russia. You

22:24.985 --> 22:26.727
know, there's plenty of them around. Take your 
pick. But don't try to push that off on, you know, on

22:28.889 --> 22:33.653
my way of life. I don't want to live in a social 
government.

22:39.619 --> 22:42.562
I like doing what I do. If I make it in life, well then 
that's, I can say, hip hip hooray. If I don't, well

22:49.068 --> 22:52.191
then that's my problem too. If I'm able to make a 
million dollars a year, well, I don't want to have

22:52.728 --> 23:04.282
to take half of it and give it to somebody else, just 
because they don't have the willingness to go out

22:52.728 --> 23:04.282
there and do it.

23:09.769 --> 23:20.322
I kind of have a thing against college students, 
just like we were sent into a group. a lot of that has

23:20.487 --> 23:31.139
gone now because I understand now that everything

23:20.487 --> 23:31.139
has changed.

23:34.002 --> 23:38.147
The college student attitude is not the same as it 
was when we were in the war in Vietnam.

23:41.070 --> 23:42.732
We have to fight for what we believe in. And if we 
lose the belief in

23:49.732 --> 23:58.752
in the liberties that we have, we might as well give 
up. Okay, well thank you again. Okay.

24:05.267 --> 24:09.276
After the interview we were talking just a second 
ago and you were telling me about the marijuana use

24:10.859 --> 24:19.351
and I told you about the statistics I heard about VD 
and marijuana use. I wanted you to tell me, repeat

24:19.491 --> 24:36.816
what you'd said about

24:19.491 --> 24:36.816
how the North Vietnamese protected them or helped 
their cause with the knowing what the American men

24:19.491 --> 24:36.816
were going to do over there. Well, the American

24:38.399 --> 24:46.727
males, the sex drive is pretty strong. So

24:46.827 --> 24:57.857
the

24:46.827 --> 24:57.857
communists used to infiltrate the South 
Vietnamese camps. It was real hard to know who was a

24:57.897 --> 25:01.340
communist and who wasn't. But they would send 
women in.

25:08.470 --> 25:12.136
that were posing as hookers. And

25:12.156 --> 25:17.825
if I can get blunt with you. And they would insert 
razor blades into the private areas. And when the

25:24.696 --> 25:35.473
GI would penetrate, you've got to understand that 
their idea a lot of times was not to kill the guy.

25:36.280 --> 25:51.858
Their whole idea was if we could do enough damage to 
where men, GIs couldn't go home and have any kids or

25:36.280 --> 25:51.858
demoralize them, that added a lot to their cause. 
So when a GI would go to bed with these Viet Cong, not

25:52.779 --> 26:05.173
knowing that they were Viet Cong, the razor blades 
would just cut them up real bad and do a lot of

26:05.660 --> 26:08.764
damage. So that was one way. Or some other times the 
women would go in with grenades. And G.I. would be

26:21.979 --> 26:28.447
laying there with them and they'd just pull the 
pins on the grenades and blow them both up. Just

26:28.507 --> 26:29.368
sacrificial. Did that happen a lot?

26:34.921 --> 26:42.969
After a few times, they really started beefing up 
security and checking a lot of the civilians that

26:34.921 --> 26:42.969
were coming through. Just stop them at random and 
check them.

26:50.076 --> 26:53.239
The dope scene, it wasn't just marijuana. It was 
just about anything you could get. Opium was real

26:56.081 --> 26:57.363
big. So easy to get. Yeah.

27:02.568 --> 27:03.949
Did you see a lot of use? No, we were not in a position 
to be really with a lot of our own military. With our

27:11.715 --> 27:20.886
own four guys, if we had ever caught anybody in our 
group even smoking a marijuana cigarette, we'd

27:11.715 --> 27:20.886
have shot them on the spot. I would have anyway 
because my life is not worth a marijuana

27:22.628 --> 27:28.274
cigarette, some guy getting high. But most of our 
guys were, or I never saw anybody in our group Was

27:35.502 --> 27:41.349
there any lacing of marijuana by the North 
Vietnamese to try to get to the Americans? They

27:41.830 --> 27:43.291
tried to tamper with it? It's hard to say because 
you never knew where the supply was coming from.

27:47.456 --> 27:49.298
Did it happen, though? I'm sure it did. Also, we 
were talking about

27:50.300 --> 27:58.249
your reconditioning when you came home. I thought 
that was interesting. Tell me a little bit more

27:59.431 --> 28:00.632
about that. Well, you have to understand that when 
you're in an area and your job is to basically kill,

28:01.827 --> 28:19.971
kill, kill, then

28:01.827 --> 28:19.971
the military acted real responsible, as far as I 
was concerned, to get you back into a... the mode of

28:21.487 --> 28:23.069
civilian life. When we came home, they spent four 
months setting us up in an apartment.

28:36.628 --> 28:44.119
Instead of waking up in the morning and reaching 
for your gun or weapon, whatever you used, they

28:45.533 --> 29:13.971
would wake you up and immediately take you and get 
the newspaper and take you into the kitchen and

28:45.533 --> 29:13.971
you'd make coffee and

28:45.533 --> 29:13.971
go to the bathroom and brush your teeth and you know 
whatever they could do to get you back used to

28:45.533 --> 29:13.971
living a civilian life instead of a military life 
and I really shouldn't say military life combat

29:14.153 --> 29:18.782
Combat line, yeah, to get you out of that train of 
thought. So

29:19.684 --> 29:24.754
they did a good job. Do you ever have any flashbacks 
or ever feel like you're seeing Vietnam while

29:25.596 --> 29:34.474
you're here? Yeah, if I see a movie, a lot of times 
I'll, you know, it'll immediately take me back.

29:48.213 --> 29:57.602
On my way over here, I heard a lot of times it's sound 
or it's smell or it's something looks familiar.

29:59.984 --> 30:03.887
Mainly, I guess, sound does it.

30:06.466 --> 30:16.138
On my way over here this afternoon, I was walking 
across the parking lot, and I heard a helicopter.

30:16.198 --> 30:21.746
And out where I live, it's just a lot of brush and 
trees and jungle and vines and everything. And

30:21.786 --> 30:30.637
when I heard this helicopter, I immediately just 
took a quick flash and went back to Vietnam. But I

30:30.657 --> 30:35.443
think that's just part of what you can go through. 
Just remembering. It has no negative effects on

30:38.826 --> 30:45.895
you

30:38.826 --> 30:45.895
though? No. It's just like the first time you rode a 
bicycle. Sometimes something will happen or if

30:49.840 --> 31:03.557
you ever fell down and scraped your hand or knee or 
whatever, something flashes and it brings you

30:49.840 --> 31:03.557
back to the memory of that. I spend a lot of time 
there and not always in real good company, so it has

31:04.364 --> 31:13.401
a tendency to bring it back.

31:16.607 --> 31:18.030
All right, well, thanks again. Okay.
