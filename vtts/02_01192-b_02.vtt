00:03.035 --> 00:08.465
I'm Martin P. Sutter, and I'm a native of the 
Midwest. I grew up in a very small town in Michigan,

00:08.585 --> 00:22.932
came down to LSU on a basketball scholarship way, 
way, way back when, when short white guys still

00:08.585 --> 00:22.932
could get basketball scholarships. That was back 
in 1972, 73. And how I really tied into Mitchell was

00:26.086 --> 00:43.915
I initially started studying chemical 
engineering at LSU and later switched over to

00:26.086 --> 00:43.915
business and finance, but went to work with a CPA 
firm initially out of school. Pete Marwick here in

00:43.975 --> 00:45.237
Houston. But after about two and a half years of 
being more in financial advisory services and

00:45.718 --> 00:52.228
that, there was enough of that engineer in me that 
wanted to grab onto something nuts and bolts. And

00:58.028 --> 01:09.481
that's when I took a very, really radical 
diversion from what you would consider purely

00:58.028 --> 01:09.481
financial business into the operational side of 
Mitchell. I went to work in the transmission and

01:09.541 --> 01:15.668
processing division of Mitchell Energy back in 
1979. And those were exciting times for Mitchell,

01:16.407 --> 01:29.648
the late 70s and early 80s, when, number one, 
hydrocarbon prices accelerated quite a bit. But

01:29.728 --> 01:40.164
more importantly for them, Mitchell has, I guess, 
always been regarded as a small oil producer, a

01:29.728 --> 01:40.164
medium-sized gas producer, but a giant in natural 
gas liquids. And that's the area that I was in. And

01:42.467 --> 01:44.170
about that time, they Historically, there were 
controls on the price of natural gas liquids, and

01:44.487 --> 01:49.795
those came off. Mitchell, as a low-cost producer, 
benefited largely from that, such that at the peak

01:50.737 --> 02:04.859
in my several years in the transmission and 
processing division, we are generating about

01:50.737 --> 02:04.859
$100 million a year of operating profit. That was 
clearly the highest growth area of Mitchell. And I

02:11.757 --> 02:27.983
worked for Bruce Withers, who was the president of 
that division, and was involved in a variety of

02:11.757 --> 02:27.983
things that I think made me very visible to 
Mitchell Senior Management and offered... In

02:28.003 --> 02:28.504
what sense? Well, if we would be involved in an 
acquisition, I would somehow... get put on that

02:35.585 --> 02:43.950
acquisition team as someone who had some 
technical understanding but also had financial

02:35.585 --> 02:43.950
skills. I was involved in the

02:50.536 --> 02:56.085
The acquisition, we made a couple major plant 
acquisitions back in those days. We also turned

02:56.686 --> 03:04.438
down some major acquisitions, which were 
probably, in retrospect, my biggest

02:56.686 --> 03:04.438
contributions to the energy side of the business. 
We had looked at being a participant in the MAPCO

03:04.818 --> 03:13.472
pipeline, which I recommended against, and we had 
been... looking at being the participant and the

03:14.515 --> 03:24.085
acquisition of a major fractionation facility 
down in Mount Bellevue, and I recommended against

03:14.515 --> 03:24.085
that as well. So I had just gotten good exposure to a 
variety of people senior to Mitchell's

03:24.105 --> 03:38.160
management, but particularly I had a very good 
relationship with Bruce Withers, who is the

03:24.105 --> 03:38.160
president of that division. I really consider 
Bruce as my mentor. He was one of the smartest,

03:41.456 --> 03:48.833
certainly one of the toughest negotiators I had 
ever experienced.

03:51.258 --> 03:57.432
My understanding was that, in terms of venture 
capital, that Mitchell had really begin to

03:57.800 --> 04:26.895
wonder, ask questions relating to venture 
capital going back into the 70s, even though I

03:57.800 --> 04:26.895
think, as I recall, they might have formed a 
venture capital subsidiary somewhere between 81

03:57.800 --> 04:26.895
and 83, legally formed a subsidiary, but the 
venture capital subsidiary didn't become

03:57.800 --> 04:26.895
operational until 1983-84 when I came in to run it. 
One of the stories we heard, and I think it was from

04:27.331 --> 04:48.917
Mr. Richmond, is that, and we were wondering if 
this is apocryphal or whether it really occurred,

04:27.331 --> 04:48.917
maybe you would know, he said that about that same 
time, 81, 82, that Mr. Mitchell determined that in

04:27.331 --> 04:48.917
order to, in fact, fund or encourage the 
development of the woodlands of clean, high-tech

04:49.252 --> 04:55.827
kinds of corporations. He realized he was going to 
have to nurture that in one way or another. So he

04:59.014 --> 05:04.667
created the Venture Capital Company in about 30 
seconds, he said, or something like that. Asked in

05:04.727 --> 05:06.010
the hall or something. In the hall of Venture 
Capital. you know, one of the office buildings,

05:08.725 --> 05:16.675
and gave it, I think there wasn't a Richmond, and 
said, make it happen, kind of thing. Right, right.

05:18.337 --> 05:19.379
Have you heard that story? Yes, and, you know, 
again, that precedes me in venture capital, and

05:19.539 --> 05:28.811
I've heard versions of that, but that's pretty 
close to the general theme of it. And like Mr.

05:28.911 --> 05:30.733
Mitchell, he... Even going back before that, 
though, Mr. Mitchells had asked the question for

05:31.034 --> 05:43.991
years, why aren't we seeing in Texas more compact 
computer stories, more high-technology

05:31.034 --> 05:43.991
companies evolve? And there were a lot of reasons 
for that, but one that kept coming back and back was

05:44.651 --> 05:53.142
that Texas was not rich in venture capital. We are 
historically rich here in risk capital, but not in

05:53.162 --> 06:00.872
professional institutional venture capital. 
And one of the things about George Mitchell is that

06:01.308 --> 06:11.470
when he believes something is necessary, he'll 
try to perhaps rally those that are in a better

06:11.956 --> 06:16.604
position or more appropriate to do it to do it. But 
if they won't do it, he'll say, well, it looks like

06:16.644 --> 06:20.651
we'll have to do it type of thing. And so I think a lot 
of that went into it. But initially, the concept

06:22.955 --> 06:35.517
within the Mitchell management was that the 
venture capital subsidiary would be something to

06:22.955 --> 06:35.517
support the growth and development of the 
woodlands, which wasn't necessarily a good

06:35.767 --> 06:45.380
strategy, and I'll lead into that. About that same 
time, again, looking in 1983, I think

06:46.282 --> 07:02.905
Mr. Withers recognized that I was looking for a new 
challenge, and I had really, bless his heart, he

06:46.282 --> 07:02.905
had... advanced me. I don't remember six or eight 
months going by when I either didn't get promoted

07:04.622 --> 07:32.318
to this or moved into that, and I had spent a couple 
years in the marketing side of the natural gas

07:04.622 --> 07:32.318
liquids business, and I think he sensed that I 
needed long-term growth and greater challenge

07:04.622 --> 07:32.318
ahead, and so when this idea of the venture capital 
subsidiary went around at the Mitchell

07:04.622 --> 07:32.318
management, I think on the basis of my broader 
skill package in that I had technical,

07:33.952 --> 07:43.987
operational, financial, marketing skills that 
that might be the type of person. And I really

07:44.047 --> 07:51.898
believe it was Bruce Withers who nominated me to 
either George Mitchell, Bud Clark, or Mike

07:44.047 --> 07:51.898
Richman for the position. And we visited about it 
for a couple months. And it really attracted me

07:59.180 --> 08:14.577
from a personality profile, my tendency has 
always been if I want to buy a dog or if I want to buy a

07:59.180 --> 08:14.577
car, you know, every reference book that I can get, 
every piece of information, I just consume myself

07:59.180 --> 08:14.577
with it. And I think in retrospect, that is a good 
personality profile for someone to be in venture

08:15.398 --> 08:25.930
capital because we're, you know, we're... The 
fact that we chose to focus in the medical

08:26.753 --> 08:46.751
biomedical technology area doesn't mean that to 
understand the difference between a company and

08:26.753 --> 08:46.751
positron emissions tomography versus 
biotechnology is any less onerous than

08:26.753 --> 08:46.751
understanding a company in the oil business or a 
company in the steel business. It's really

08:47.252 --> 08:49.656
something that you need to consume yourself with. 
So it was attractive to me, and so they chose me to

08:50.530 --> 09:05.217
come in and run the venture subsidiary, and that 
was about in 1984, late 83, early 84. And it was the

09:05.537 --> 09:09.364
first company that was on the wall in December. 
Right, right, December of 84. Yeah, so that really

09:11.589 --> 09:14.614
must have been... late 83, early 84, because one of 
the more intelligent things that I think we did

09:15.067 --> 09:43.842
was, again, just as Mitchell apparently had 
handed to Richmond, said make it happen, Richmond

09:15.067 --> 09:43.842
handed to me, said no one really had any idea of what 
the venture capital subsidiary should do,

09:15.067 --> 09:43.842
whether we should invest in existing companies 
and new companies and computer companies and this

09:15.067 --> 09:43.842
company. And what I did was I was most interested in 
making it successful. I was not, I believed from

09:51.036 --> 10:02.728
day one that you could not operate a venture 
capital subsidiary for the purpose of, quote,

09:51.036 --> 10:02.728
economic development. I believed that it had to be 
purely success driven with economic development

10:03.448 --> 10:11.736
coming as a result. not as a purpose. What's the 
background for that belief? Well, the background

10:17.659 --> 10:26.427
for that belief, in my mind, was that the venture 
business was a tough business to start with. And

10:26.608 --> 10:42.043
historically, if you invest in 10 companies, if 
you're lucky, one is a smashing success, a couple

10:26.608 --> 10:42.043
do OK, a couple do pretty bad, and two or three 
outright fail. And if that was the history in a

10:42.547 --> 11:05.668
broader venture capital strategy, the idea that 
we could use a really what was a relatively small

10:42.547 --> 11:05.668
venture fund, a $15 million to attract not an 
average, but the best of companies to participate

10:42.547 --> 11:05.668
in the woodlands, my attitude was that If a 
company, if it's an existing company and it's got

11:06.053 --> 11:18.261
good management and it's got a good story, good 
product to tell, it doesn't need to move anywhere

11:06.053 --> 11:18.261
to attract its capital. Someone, wherever they 
may be, they'll be able to attract the capital to

11:18.602 --> 11:24.315
run their company. I believe that if we took that 
strategy of only financing companies that would

11:24.599 --> 11:38.658
be willing to come participate in the woodlands, 
we'd be getting basically people that couldn't

11:24.599 --> 11:38.658
get their money elsewhere, and it would be a 
failing strategy. In fact, in my opinion, that is

11:39.459 --> 11:45.848
what happened with that first company, which I'll 
come to. But what I did was to manage a small venture

11:46.300 --> 11:51.769
fund. I spent the better part of a year doing no 
investing but really studying how to make this

11:52.129 --> 11:59.421
successful. And one of the things I determined was 
that back in that period of time, the early 80s, was

12:00.362 --> 12:11.059
a period of enormous growth in venture capital 
nationwide where the Excuse me, I wanted to ask

12:11.832 --> 12:22.652
you, at some point, would you comment, in 1984 now, 
we're entering the demise of high fuel prices, and

12:11.832 --> 12:22.652
so with the collapse in Texas, how did that Well, it 
really, at that time, again, I always look at the

12:23.020 --> 12:32.169
real demise occurred mostly in 86. I think in the 
spring of 86 is when they went real down. They went

12:36.534 --> 12:42.500
down some, but people still took the attitude in 84 
that, well, it's temporary. It'll come back up.

12:43.641 --> 12:45.243
It's always going to come back up. That's the 
attitude. I looked at budgets in Mitchell for

12:47.045 --> 12:51.289
years and years, and always in the fifth year, 
Prices were back up there, so there was generally

12:51.269 --> 12:58.520
that attitude and no concern that energy prices 
were going to go down long term. What I was more

13:00.202 --> 13:04.469
concerned about was, you know, how are we going to 
make this thing work? And what I saw was, although

13:04.769 --> 13:17.428
we are going into a period of time when, you know, 
venture capital, the fund sizes, the total amount

13:04.769 --> 13:17.428
of venture capital under management nationwide 
was growing, You know, that's typically when you

13:17.898 --> 13:21.426
worry a little bit. Well, everybody's jumping on 
the bandwagon. You know, everybody's doing this.

13:24.713 --> 13:36.598
You know, the proverbial California real estate 
fear that sooner or later the bubble's got to

13:24.713 --> 13:36.598
burst, although in that example, you know, it's 
only starting to show signs of that happening now.

13:37.118 --> 13:50.235
But what I was afraid of was I saw a lot of venture 
firms that were small to medium size that were

13:37.118 --> 13:50.235
trying to emulate the strategy of the larger 
venture firms. There were these large firms, the

13:50.275 --> 14:04.493
Hambrick and Quist and the Kleiner Perkins that 
could successfully invest in biotechnology in

13:50.275 --> 14:04.493
San Diego and in telecommunications in Boston 
because they had the resources, the capital, and

14:04.658 --> 14:11.769
they had the expertise within their firms to be 
able to do that. But what I saw was a whole bunch of

14:12.149 --> 14:17.878
small to medium sized venture funds trying to do 
the same thing. And if you're a small venture fund

14:18.058 --> 14:27.612
with two or three partners, the likelihood that 
you have the intellectual capability to

14:18.058 --> 14:27.612
understand telecommunications and 
biotechnology much less spend the amount your

14:27.878 --> 14:54.308
time there requires to travel to Boston travel San 
Diego you know it didn't make sense to me so I

14:27.878 --> 14:54.308
applying that for our you know fun to be successful 
not only did we have to have a regional orientation

14:27.878 --> 14:54.308
which is what I was handed to start with but we 
needed to be industry-oriented what I didn't

14:27.878 --> 14:54.308
think we could do in my opinion was I didn't really 
want to have anything to do with the computer

14:54.828 --> 14:59.255
electronics industry. We would have just been the 
115th venture fund to invest in the 197th

14:59.516 --> 15:07.870
Winchester disk drive company. We had no 
particular expertise. We had nothing that would

15:10.434 --> 15:19.249
indicate to me that we were going to be any better 
than the next guy at doing that. So what I did was I

15:19.921 --> 15:24.654
looked at what were the strengths of our region. I 
considered space commercialization. And

15:28.283 --> 15:35.382
despite how unpopular it was politically to say 
that isn't where we want to put our money at that

15:28.283 --> 15:35.382
time in Houston, Privately, there's no way that a 
small venture fund can particularly participate

15:35.868 --> 15:43.499
in that type of industry. Agriculture was 
attractive to me, and I felt Texas had the

15:44.480 --> 15:54.134
infrastructure to do that. But that wasn't my 
number one choice, and I've always said that's

15:54.734 --> 16:00.863
something I'm going to do down the road maybe. The 
microelectronics, telecommunications, we do

16:01.163 --> 16:11.378
have some infrastructure here in Texas for that in 
the San Antonio-Austin-Dallas corridor. But

16:11.618 --> 16:24.978
again, I've tended to be a contrarian by nature, 
and where everybody else is placing their bet,

16:11.618 --> 16:24.978
that's fine, and I'm not going to necessarily bet 
against it, but I'm not going to. Typically what

16:24.998 --> 16:26.580
happens is, It gets overpriced, overbid, and it 
doesn't become attractive. So I wasn't

16:33.742 --> 16:35.585
interested in that. In the years that I spent with 
Pete Marwick, I had some health care clients. That

16:42.636 --> 16:44.819
industry always fascinated me. We were starting 
to hear more about biotechnology. uh... you know

16:50.810 --> 17:15.400
with uh... some background in chemistry uh... you 
know it's funny because within our firm now uh... i

16:50.810 --> 17:15.400
have the chemical background and i tend to believe 
the world is chemistry d n a r four base pairs of

16:50.810 --> 17:15.400
proteins are twenty amino acids one of my 
partner's background is in biology and he looks at

16:50.810 --> 17:15.400
the world is being biologically driven but 
nonetheless uh... We thought that that was

17:15.667 --> 17:25.524
something that just we had an incredible untapped 
resource here, not just in Houston, but in Texas.

17:25.544 --> 17:36.223
And what we did was we determined that the academic 
institutions here in Houston were spending about

17:25.544 --> 17:36.223
a quarter of a billion dollars a year on research 
and development and you add in another half dozen

17:36.676 --> 18:00.051
outside of houston within texas and europe to a 
half billion dollars a year of research and

17:36.676 --> 18:00.051
development in the life sciences area and this 
equated would equate to an enormous

17:36.676 --> 18:00.051
pharmaceutical or or health care company this is a 
lot of money but was was maybe even more

17:36.676 --> 18:00.051
significant to me was the fact that this wasn't 
research done out in the plains of Kansas, which

18:00.605 --> 18:08.196
was for the sake of science, the reproductive 
cycle of the Drosilla fly. That may be

18:08.416 --> 18:14.625
scientifically interesting, but might not have 
any clinical significance. What we had here in

18:14.665 --> 18:26.022
Houston particularly was these symbiotic 
relationships, Baylor College of Medicine,

18:14.665 --> 18:26.022
Methodist Hospital, UT Cancer Center, MD 
Anderson, et cetera, et cetera. And what that

18:26.407 --> 18:35.965
meant to me was that people that were writing the 
research grants were having lunch with the

18:26.407 --> 18:35.965
doctors that were trying to save lives. And 
overall, I felt that much more of the research

18:36.025 --> 18:42.778
being done here would be clinically driven. 
instead of driven for the pure advancement of

18:43.197 --> 18:47.362
science. And that was just an inherent field. What 
I did, though, is I looked nationally and found,

18:50.025 --> 19:07.804
and this surprises me, and it has changed much 
since then, but back in 1983, if you took the pie

18:50.025 --> 19:07.804
where venture capital nationwide had been 
invested, you found that there was a slice there

18:50.025 --> 19:07.804
for health care. But if you subdivided the health 
care slice to extricate from it that amount of

19:12.020 --> 19:30.407
venture capital they've gone to what I'll call the 
delivery system, hospital management, HMOs,

19:12.020 --> 19:30.407
things like that, meaning the residual slice of 
that pie would be medical, biomedical technology

19:12.020 --> 19:30.407
versus services. The percentage was incredibly 
small. It was less than 5%. And when you're

19:36.175 --> 19:38.719
talking, you know, whatever, $200 billion U.S. 
healthcare industry, that seemed to be a very

19:39.458 --> 20:01.197
small slice of a pie, that it was an industry that, 
in my opinion, then and still today is one of the

19:39.458 --> 20:01.197
maybe even few, I hate to use that word, but one of 
the few industries where the United States still

19:39.458 --> 20:01.197
has a strong technological leadership. So that 
was attractive to me. The money, venture capital

20:05.864 --> 20:11.671
money, is going to services, HMO-type 
operations? There was, but even that, even if you

20:11.891 --> 20:22.684
didn't extricate the services slice of the pie, 
the slice of that pie for health care was not very

20:11.891 --> 20:22.684
big. And there were only a couple venture capital 
firms back in 83 that could say, you know, that they

20:28.447 --> 20:35.076
invest even as little as a third of their capital in 
the healthcare area. Why do you think that was? Was

20:36.317 --> 20:38.020
it because of government regulations? Well, I 
think regulatory issues probably discouraged a

20:38.240 --> 20:44.388
lot of people. You've got to understand, the 
venture industry was built upon and grown from

20:44.548 --> 20:51.637
computers. I mean, the Silicon Valley 
phenomenon. Consequently,

20:56.915 --> 21:04.126
Most venture capitalists that have technical 
backgrounds, it's electrical engineering.

21:04.186 --> 21:11.377
People that knew bits and bytes didn't know 
monoclonal antibodies and recombinant DNA. One

21:11.777 --> 21:18.147
of

21:11.777 --> 21:18.147
the things that Dr. Lamb mentioned is that FDA and 
various regulatory agencies demand rigorous

21:18.768 --> 21:27.620
testing and what have you before. Something which 
may have been developed actually becomes a

21:28.081 --> 21:32.186
marketable product. There's a long... There is. 
And to me, that does not act as strong an impediment

21:34.269 --> 21:45.484
to me as to invest in health care. Because on the 
same token, that acts as a barrier to entry for your

21:45.818 --> 21:50.505
competitors. So there's a flip side to that coin. 
What it really does, though, is it makes in a world

21:54.391 --> 22:10.775
market, which we're more and more into every day, 
it makes U.S. companies less competitive on a

21:54.391 --> 22:10.775
worldwide basis because it takes them more of 
their capital and more of their time to get

21:54.391 --> 22:10.775
products approved in their home market. Right. 
But from a venture capital perspective, it wasn't

22:11.215 --> 22:19.369
as big a consideration maybe as Dominic felt it 
would be. But in any event, I sold everybody on that

22:19.389 --> 22:24.819
strategy that we would focus on that. But keep in 
mind that the Mitchell organization was still

22:24.899 --> 22:34.135
pretty much of the mindset that this was a 
woodlands-oriented thing. Interesting. The

22:35.495 --> 22:44.467
first company we end up investing in was Key 
Concepts, which was an electronics company, had

22:35.495 --> 22:44.467
electronic keyboards for computers. Now, that 
deal came to us, was referred to us by Lloyd Benson

22:45.208 --> 22:51.877
III, and I turned it down. And it came in again, and I 
turned it down a second time. But the next thing I

22:56.504 --> 23:01.911
knew was... The people up here were hearing things 
like, well, these people can lease 20,000 square

23:02.347 --> 23:09.535
feet of space. And all of a sudden, the powers that 
be, and I won't use names, but eventually was

23:10.236 --> 23:22.010
determined that we should put a little bit of money 
in and take a little risk on this one. And in fact, in

23:22.811 --> 23:30.480
retrospect, it was probably the best thing that 
ever happened to me. Because this was a company

23:30.916 --> 23:35.523
that failed. And in fact, if that company had 
succeeded, then what we would have been doing,

23:35.543 --> 23:51.486
then I would have been fighting this battle of that 
you just invest in companies that are willing to

23:35.543 --> 23:51.486
move to the woodlands. But in fact, not only did it 
fail, but I think It actually was kind of an

23:55.115 --> 24:04.910
embarrassment that a company that leased all that 
space and employed quite a few people became a

23:55.115 --> 24:04.910
failure. That didn't happen overnight, and there 
was no direct link to it. But in all candor, I've

24:12.040 --> 24:21.915
always believed that that was probably one of the 
more important elements to the ultimate success

24:12.040 --> 24:21.915
of our venture capital program. Thereafter, 
people, I think, were more convinced that, no, you

24:22.351 --> 24:32.146
can't just do this as a real estate tool. This, in 
fact, is a business in its own self. I have always

24:37.354 --> 24:49.152
held that the economic development of the 
woodlands will be the result of the success of the

24:37.354 --> 24:49.152
venture program, but I have always, and the reason 
that I always felt that tying the venture capital

24:50.060 --> 25:16.097
activities to the woodlands, even in that way, was 
acceptable was the fact that what we also chose as a

24:50.060 --> 25:16.097
role to play in our venture program was that we 
would work with the universities around the state

24:50.060 --> 25:16.097
to set up new companies as a result of their 
technology. Well, when you're setting up a new

25:16.517 --> 25:18.480
company, you know, whether they're located here, 
down the street, you know, in the next county, you

25:19.203 --> 25:29.300
know, it's inconsequential generally to the 
people involved. But what we also felt was, you

25:29.320 --> 25:36.452
know, those companies, we knew many of those 
companies would be the biotechnology type

25:29.320 --> 25:36.452
companies. And again, I have always been 
cognizant of the fact that these companies that we

25:36.854 --> 25:44.509
are, we're in a world business. Everything is a 
world business today. And I always place Texas as

25:47.115 --> 25:53.888
being a country and every other state is another 
country. And, you know, the economic welfare of

25:54.229 --> 25:58.137
Texas is not only you know, what products that we 
can ship to Japan but what products we can ship to

25:58.370 --> 26:08.499
Idaho or what products from Idaho that come into 
Texas that we can learn to make here. And one of the

26:09.280 --> 26:18.128
things I recognized was that, you know, the 
business of biotechnology was an intellectual

26:09.280 --> 26:18.128
business. And it meant that the people that were, 
you know, that made up the workforce of these

26:18.929 --> 26:26.115
companies were, uh... highly trained highly 
skilled highly educated uh... fairly well paid

26:26.483 --> 26:56.170
for the most part and we were entering a period 
where they were in great demand where you know a

26:26.483 --> 26:56.170
protein chemist might have languished in an 
academic laboratory for twenty years and all of a

26:26.483 --> 26:56.170
sudden a protein chemist you know he's like uh... a 
designated hitter in the american league you know

26:26.483 --> 26:56.170
he writes his own ticket if we're gonna if we're 
gonna create successful companies uh... we're

26:26.483 --> 26:56.170
gonna be competing We're not going to be competing 
against companies in Dallas and companies in Fort

26:56.538 --> 27:01.566
Worth. We're going to be competing against 
companies in San Francisco and San Diego and in

27:01.586 --> 27:06.114
Boston. And if we're going to hire the best 
intellectual talent to be able to compete with

27:06.855 --> 27:17.092
those companies, we have to offer the package. Why 
would someone come to work in Houston? to work for a

27:22.475 --> 27:41.335
biotechnology company if they can, as an 
alternative, they can go to work in Palo Alto,

27:22.475 --> 27:41.335
particularly where, you know, scientific people 
might be a little bit more risk averse, whereas if

27:22.475 --> 27:41.335
that company happened to fail, there's another 
company right down the street that they can go to

27:22.475 --> 27:41.335
work to. They've got, you know, they've got a 
culture there. They've got, you know, the

27:44.898 --> 27:50.524
physical beauty of California or wherever. And 
what we opined was to be able to recruit

27:50.858 --> 27:57.024
management, which we didn't have. We've got all 
this technology here, but never having a

27:57.164 --> 28:09.716
prevalent or a dominating health care industry or 
medical technology industry here, we don't have a

27:57.164 --> 28:09.716
good pool of management people. So, A, we knew we 
were going to be recruiting senior management

28:09.736 --> 28:18.064
people, and we'd be recruiting them from 
California and Boston and New Jersey. B, we knew

28:18.719 --> 28:25.995
that we would have to be recruiting scientists, 
and we'd be having to recruit those scientists

28:18.719 --> 28:25.995
from the same places. I find that even though maybe 
the Mitchell organization saw the woodlands as

28:26.043 --> 28:41.843
the primary mission initially, what I saw was that 
my primary mission was to finance successful

28:26.043 --> 28:41.843
companies. If they all moved to the woodlands but 
all failed, then we'd have wasted not only our

28:42.563 --> 28:52.776
investment dollars, but all the dollars that went 
into providing them space and all that. But I felt

28:53.262 --> 29:00.491
that to enhance my ability to grow successful 
companies, that the Woodlands was a genuine tool.

29:01.132 --> 29:08.701
I felt that when I, and in all candor, I've spent as 
much time recruiting people as I have doing

29:01.132 --> 29:08.701
anything else. And I cannot attract people from 
California to come to live in the city of Houston to

29:09.442 --> 29:17.852
a large degree. And one of the biggest problems, 
they land at the airport and they see sign

29:18.085 --> 29:23.633
pollution all the way into town. And you've 
already lost them. You haven't even had dinner yet

29:26.677 --> 29:28.700
and you've lost them. So we actually here in our 
organization, we saw our ability to take what was

29:28.800 --> 29:41.718
world-class technology, which we had capital, 
which is the most generic of all this. But the third

29:42.299 --> 29:46.725
part of the triangle was management and people. We 
saw our only way, perhaps, or our equalizing way to

29:47.110 --> 30:01.405
recruit the best people was to offer this, what I 
believe is this incredible, you know, element,

29:47.110 --> 30:01.405
environment of the woodlands. So I use that more as 
a tool to grow successful companies. The result,

30:06.750 --> 30:16.020
excuse me, has been that our program has been 
highly successful and as a result has, has

30:16.540 --> 30:41.272
produced this economic development of the 
woodlands, and now, fortunately, has produced a

30:16.540 --> 30:41.272
real critical mass where there's probably 
nowhere else in Texas, even though it's small by

30:16.540 --> 30:41.272
California standards, there's no place in Texas 
where there's more of a critical mass of

30:16.540 --> 30:41.272
privatized life science companies than we have 
here in the woodlands. Could you recalibrate? the

30:44.941 --> 30:46.803
development of some of that critical mass? Sure, 
sure. It was, and again, we take, you know, right

30:47.704 --> 31:02.100
now we look back and to summarize, we have 17 or 18 
companies that we have financed through the

30:47.704 --> 31:02.100
Mitchell subsidiary and now our private 
organization. We became independent of Mitchell

31:02.160 --> 31:05.143
in 88, 89.

31:07.826 --> 31:14.273
Rough, basically a third of those companies are 
here in the woodlands and A part of our skills, of

31:14.911 --> 31:31.356
those 18 companies, I would say eight or nine of 
those companies existed from the transfer of

31:14.911 --> 31:31.356
technology from an academic institution, 
generally where we played the role of the founders

31:14.911 --> 31:31.356
of the company. As an example, the very first 
company that we acted as a lead investor in, the

31:31.376 --> 31:40.851
very first company that was created as a result in 
texas as a result of technology transfer of

31:41.253 --> 32:10.872
academic laboratory was a company out of baylor 
college of medicine in 1985 called

31:41.253 --> 32:10.872
cardiovascular systems and cardiovascular 
systems which later became known by the name

31:41.253 --> 32:10.872
amnion inc was formed to commercialize a what we 
call an autologous blood transfusion system it

31:41.253 --> 32:10.872
was developed at baylor college of medicine 
somewhat under the direction of people in Michael

32:11.746 --> 32:18.914
DeBakey's group. And what they sought was an 
ability during a surgical procedure,

32:18.934 --> 32:39.458
particularly a thoracic-type procedure where 
there was blood loss, whether in the old days,

32:18.934 --> 32:39.458
bypass surgery produced a lot more blood loss than 
it does today, but these aortic aneurysm

32:18.934 --> 32:39.458
procedures and all that, there's a high amount of 
blood loss. Two things were problematic even

32:40.180 --> 32:45.867
before the AIDS epidemic. One was that the 
availability of blood, the ability to transfuse

32:45.887 --> 32:54.197
enough blood to keep these patients alive. And 
number two, with donor transfused blood or

32:54.718 --> 33:10.137
homologous transfusion, which means the blood 
from someone else, there was clinically a fairly

32:54.718 --> 33:10.137
significant risk associated with non-A, non-B 
hepatitis. And even today, non-A, non-B,

33:10.842 --> 33:18.351
hepatitis is clinically much higher a risk factor 
than AIDS is. But nonetheless, the doctors were

33:18.912 --> 33:23.698
familiar with this risk way back. And so what Dr. 
DeBakey wanted was a better way to, and they had

33:24.639 --> 33:35.432
some more modest systems that would take a 
patient's blood during surgical procedure,

33:24.639 --> 33:35.432
recycle it, But it would do maybe one unit of blood 
every 20 minutes. Well, in one of these aneurysm

33:39.065 --> 33:46.498
patients, you might need to go through six or seven 
units of blood in 20 minutes. So making a long story

33:46.538 --> 34:02.584
short, they developed a system that would take the 
blood, it would run it through a filter, then it

33:46.538 --> 34:02.584
would run it through a centrifuge separating the 
red cells from the plasma and platelets, wash down

33:46.538 --> 34:02.584
those red cells and re-infuse those red cells, a 
unit of red cells to the patient. And it was capable

34:07.798 --> 34:11.161
of doing this in a matter of two or three minutes. So 
it meant that you could almost keep real time up.

34:15.305 --> 34:32.520
And that not only produced much less risk of a 
transfusion-related disease, but just in terms

34:15.305 --> 34:32.520
of blood, we had a patient in California after we 
started selling these from a small hospital that

34:32.956 --> 34:47.854
they went through, you know, your body holds 
roughly 17 to 20 units of blood, but if it's going in

34:32.956 --> 34:47.854
and out, this particular case, they used, they 
salvaged what they estimate was something like

34:32.956 --> 34:47.854
150, 170 units of blood. Yeah, it was, you know, 
just blood in, blood out for, you know, the eight

34:48.976 --> 34:54.202
hours they were doing this procedure. And in this 
particular case, the patient died. But what was

34:58.893 --> 35:06.661
those people at that little hospital in 
California were just so happy about was, you know,

34:58.893 --> 35:06.661
that could have been the worst case. Not only did 
they lose a patient, but they would have wiped out

35:06.721 --> 35:11.105
the entire blood bank. And for everybody else that 
needed blood, they would not have had any. So this

35:15.089 --> 35:17.011
product was an attractive product. It was 
patented. There was a patent ultimately received

35:22.156 --> 35:24.418
on a bowl. But what was interesting was, and to this 
date, That product, that technology, if you will,

35:28.812 --> 35:48.351
I'd rather call it a product than a technology, but 
that particular product had the lowest

35:28.812 --> 35:48.351
technological profile and addressed the 
smallest market, as sexy as it may seem, of all the

35:28.812 --> 35:48.351
companies that we've since helped create. But 
nonetheless, we took advantage of that. We took

35:53.456 --> 35:57.520
advantage particularly of the fact that we had a 
startup company, but yet When we launched that

35:57.905 --> 36:11.804
product, we had a startup company, but we had a 
product that had been clinically utilized at

35:57.905 --> 36:11.804
Baylor, at Henry Ford Hospital, at the Mayo 
Clinic, at a variety of attractive clinical

35:57.905 --> 36:11.804
sites. How did the connection come between you and 
the company initially? What they had was they

36:16.330 --> 36:25.161
initially at Baylor, they tried to raise a 
partnership that was going to fund a bushel basket

36:16.330 --> 36:25.161
of projects. And that was never successful they 
were never able to raise that money and one of those

36:26.862 --> 36:54.405
projects that was in that partnership was it was 
labeled a continuous blood auto transfusion

36:26.862 --> 36:54.405
system and i said well if they're if you know you're 
going to develop a continuous blood auto

36:26.862 --> 36:54.405
transfusion system does that mean that there 
exists today a discontinuous blood auto

36:26.862 --> 36:54.405
transfusion system and they said yes and i asked 
them how rapidly it would cycle a unit of blood. And

36:58.259 --> 37:01.463
I said, you know, gee, that's pretty good just what 
you have right there. Why don't we evaluate

37:01.503 --> 37:06.569
whether that product is commercially viable? And 
we did so. And so we set up the company called

37:08.231 --> 37:11.895
Cardiovascular Systems. We became the lead 
investor in the company. I hired Don Spirison, who

37:16.480 --> 37:20.545
is now my partner, to run that. He became the 
president of that company back in 85. And in a

37:25.584 --> 37:31.471
nutshell, we financed that company in June of 85 
with $1.5 million. By March-April of 86, it had

37:31.631 --> 37:39.179
shipped its first product. By the second quarter 
of 87, it hit its first profitable month. And by

37:48.409 --> 37:50.211
1988, it had sustained profitability on a monthly 
basis. And we ended up selling it for

37:56.468 --> 38:03.379
approximately $15 million to COBE Laboratories 
in 1988. So that was, if we could create that

38:03.859 --> 38:20.063
success with such a low technology and a small 
market product, it very much encouraged us that

38:03.859 --> 38:20.063
some of the other things that we had done 
subsequent to that would have even higher

38:20.347 --> 38:21.848
potential. When you set up the venture, your 
investment in this company, you buy stock, is that

38:22.029 --> 38:29.075
how you fund it? Right, right. So when you sold for 
$15 million, you sold your stock or the total? The

38:33.339 --> 38:36.202
total, the total package. Of which part was yours? 
Of which part was ours. What we have done, and

38:39.805 --> 38:47.873
again, these technology transfer ventures have 
been the ones that we have made our prized,

38:50.198 --> 38:53.103
place that we have here in our own backyard. The 
other thing was venture capitalists had not had a

38:54.485 --> 39:03.158
historically real good relationship with 
academia, the alleged vulture capitalism. And

39:03.879 --> 39:12.132
one of the other things that I did early on was I 
decided that if we're going to do this, we had to be

39:03.879 --> 39:12.132
able to wear white hats. If we couldn't be good guys 
and be successful at this, well, then we need to get

39:12.833 --> 39:18.282
in another business at Pitt. And what we chose as, 
we studied working with academia, and what we

39:18.650 --> 39:39.421
found in California, for example, venture 
capitalists would typically create a company,

39:18.650 --> 39:39.421
and then they would bring in the scientists as 
employees, full-time employees of that company,

39:18.650 --> 39:39.421
and, you know, license and technology and all 
that. But what that was doing was, you know, it was

39:39.461 --> 39:45.450
robbing the institutions of some of their best 
people. and hence the vulture capitalist thing.

39:48.456 --> 39:51.060
And I thought, jeez, there's got to be a better 
formula. Plus, I didn't like the idea of just

39:51.100 --> 39:54.145
licensing. I thought we needed to find a mechanism 
where everybody was on the same playing field,

39:54.426 --> 40:07.287
where it was a we type of a thing instead of a we 
versus they. And our prescription for that was to

40:07.604 --> 40:22.104
make sure that everybody had the same vested 
ownership and that what we would do when we created

40:07.604 --> 40:22.104
a new company, we would set up a new company, in this 
case, Cardiovascular Systems. We would provide

40:23.146 --> 40:36.885
for licensing the technology from Baylor College 
of Medicine to the company that Baylor would get

40:23.146 --> 40:36.885
equity, would get stock ownership, that the 
investigator who had developed the technology

40:37.203 --> 40:52.683
would get equity ownership in the company, that 
we, through our capital investment, would get

40:37.203 --> 40:52.683
equity ownership, and then management that we 
brought in through their earning their equity by

40:37.203 --> 40:52.683
running the company, they would have equity 
ownership. And consequently, we are all

40:52.744 --> 41:02.016
interested and we would all benefit in the success 
or be hurt by the failure in the same way. So there

41:02.116 --> 41:04.459
wasn't any games to be played. Is there any formula 
for control of the company management? Did you

41:10.021 --> 41:13.866
carefully avoid having 51% of the stock? Well, 
we're not opposed to having control. On the other

41:19.453 --> 41:24.219
hand, it is varied on a deal by deal. Some venture 
capitalists are overwhelmingly concerned about

41:24.259 --> 41:27.843
control. In our case, We weren't. We took the 
attitude that, you know, we're going to be pretty

41:31.010 --> 41:36.898
darn selective of the people we're going to do 
business with. Well, in all honesty, it's in all

41:39.542 --> 41:51.479
candor that it has, you know, generally as a rule of 
thumb, it has been more of a problem as a venture

41:39.542 --> 41:51.479
capitalist when you don't have control. And the 
reason you're concerned about control is not when

41:51.879 --> 41:56.586
times are going good, but when times are going bad. 
And one thing that we did want to avoid was, again,

41:56.633 --> 42:09.687
we allowed this ownership to happen despite the 
fact that we left the academic scientist at the

41:56.633 --> 42:09.687
academic institution. And we paid, you know, we 
might have paid them a little as a consultant, but

42:10.348 --> 42:15.494
we didn't rob those people. Number one, we wanted 
the Baylor administration to think kindly enough

42:15.894 --> 42:25.965
of us so that we could do deal number two and deal 
number 13 But also, we didn't want to have academic

42:26.215 --> 42:36.070
scientists believing that they could run 
companies either and involved in the day-to-day

42:26.215 --> 42:36.070
management of the company. We gave everybody the 
same vested interest, but we wanted everybody to

42:36.110 --> 42:43.020
have their appropriate role within the venture. 
Interestingly, at that time, we could do that with

42:44.582 --> 42:47.427
Baylor. But back when we started doing that in 85, 
we could not do that with any of the state

42:48.148 --> 42:55.058
institutions. And in fact, I personally spent a 
lot of trips to Austin to help

42:55.274 --> 43:19.543
participate in the drafting of House Bill 1402, 
which was passed, I think, in 86, which then

42:55.274 --> 43:19.543
allowed the state institutions and their faculty 
members to have stock in companies that were

42:55.274 --> 43:19.543
commercially launched. When was that passed? 
That was passed in 1986.

43:25.244 --> 43:39.198
And we, after Cardiovascular Systems, we were 
actually the founder of the first company

43:25.244 --> 43:39.198
commercial enterprise launched from any of the 
University of Texas, 13 components. That company

43:39.658 --> 43:44.883
was called Life Cell Corporation, and that came 
out of the Health Science Center here in Houston.

43:44.943 --> 43:47.646
That company's here in the Woodlands. And we were 
also involved in the creation of the first company

43:47.666 --> 43:54.913
out of the University of Texas, MD Anderson. about 
that same period, a company now called Argus

43:55.467 --> 44:02.433
Pharmaceuticals, which is here in the Woodlands. 
Let me follow up on something that we started and

44:02.533 --> 44:08.138
straightened up. You were giving us this case 
study about cardiovascular systems. One of the

44:10.620 --> 44:12.661
things you mentioned earlier was it was sold. 
Henry asked you about control and what have you.

44:17.205 --> 44:18.446
How was the decision made? How did the... To sell? 
How was the decision made? The Board of Directors

44:25.859 --> 44:29.503
makes that decision. In this particular case, the 
venture capitalists did own more than 50,

44:29.764 --> 44:39.736
collectively, all the venture capitalists that 
were in that deal owned more than 50% of the stock.

44:40.397 --> 44:45.463
But the venture, we had debate over what we should 
do. In that particular case, an interesting case

44:46.144 --> 44:53.453
study, our reason to sell, and we're at a time when 
the company was profitable, was growing, It was

44:53.838 --> 45:03.113
beating its major competitor, a company 10 times 
its size, three out of four times that we would take

44:53.838 --> 45:03.113
them on head-to-head in the marketplace. We were 
beating them. The problem was multifold. One is

45:08.041 --> 45:16.335
that, fine, we are beating them three out of four 
times we are taking them on head-to-head. They

45:16.838 --> 45:25.908
were growing like crazy, too, because they were 
finding three or four other hospitals that we

45:16.838 --> 45:25.908
could never reach because we had a limited sales 
force of about six people. And we could not justify

45:26.768 --> 45:35.077
growing our sales force on that single product 
alone because, again, the market was relatively

45:26.768 --> 45:35.077
small. What we needed was we needed another 
product or two to add to our sales people's efforts

45:35.678 --> 45:45.428
so we could justify a large sales force. We spent 
the better part of a year trying to identify a

45:45.830 --> 45:52.920
product or a company to acquire, and we actually 
came up with one. We negotiated a letter of intent

45:53.060 --> 45:59.289
to acquire the Sorensen product line from Abbott 
Laboratories. The problem was that we had a

46:01.472 --> 46:15.212
difficult time financing that acquisition, 
because this was now, when we did this, this was in

46:01.472 --> 46:15.212
88, and Texas banks were in bad shape then. And what 
happened was that this was an acquisition that I

46:15.496 --> 46:21.504
believe the total acquisition price was about $9 
million. We didn't want to, we wanted to put in,

46:22.546 --> 46:30.657
say, maybe a seven, somewhere seven. We wanted to 
put about half of it in as equity and half of it in as

46:30.677 --> 46:34.523
debt. We didn't want to over leverage the company. 
And the company was now profitable. The

46:40.972 --> 46:45.418
acquisition could clearly show that its cash flow 
could service the debt. The problem was that Texas

46:46.998 --> 46:51.004
banks weren't doing anything. The deal was 
attractive to out-of-state banks, but because we

46:51.024 --> 47:02.320
were only looking to borrow $3 or $4 million, the 
out-of-state banks said, well, we just can't loan

46:51.024 --> 47:02.320
that small amount. We'd have to do 5 to 10 to be able 
to get it approved.
