00:02.528 --> 00:29.160
football game on Saturday and then we'd have the next weekend until Thanksgiving Day of the next week to get ready for the Texas game and that was the time to build a bonfire and it was made out a lot softer stuff in those days and we kind of pile things up there we did have some logs and all but you know much smaller and

00:30.389 --> 00:35.955
I don't remember, you know, going out in the wood and cutting thousands of logs and all that.

00:35.975 --> 00:50.550
We didn't do it that way, but guarding the bonfire was the real chore because it was made of lighter stuff and it was vulnerable to the Texas people slipping in and setting it off.

00:50.711 --> 00:53.634
Did anybody attempt to set it off in your years?

00:54.795 --> 00:56.717
I'm told that

00:57.322 --> 01:03.551
The year after I left here, I believe it was an airplane flew over and that was after I was gone.

01:03.571 --> 01:04.752
But there was one.

01:04.812 --> 01:11.982
But that was our greatest fear, that someone was going to light this fire and that'd be a heck of an embarrassment to us and all that.

01:13.585 --> 01:16.389
Did y'all use rubbish or was it all logs?

01:18.191 --> 01:19.633
It seemed like it was...

01:20.390 --> 01:22.855
Could have been a little bit of both, as I recall.

01:22.875 --> 01:28.506
And it was a tee, one... It was kind of a teepee kind of thing, but it was much smaller than what we have today.

01:28.526 --> 01:29.447
Didn't go way away.

01:29.467 --> 01:29.888
Oh, no.

01:30.409 --> 01:34.878
And was there a real outhouse up on top?

01:34.898 --> 01:35.519
I believe so.

01:35.960 --> 01:36.561
I believe so.

01:36.801 --> 01:40.288
You know, my impression was that it was real.

01:40.724 --> 01:48.876
One of the things I've learned in doing these, typist, you don't need to put this in the TypeScript because it's in somebody else's statement.

01:49.478 --> 01:51.747
This goes way back in the 20s.

01:52.148 --> 02:07.107
that he lived at Northgate, and his father told him that in the early days, you made an arrangement with the Corps to come and get your outhouse, and in return, the campus provided you with a brand new one.

02:07.828 --> 02:12.374
And he said one year, his father said, now that our family is so bigger, we need a bigger one.

02:12.995 --> 02:16.519
And he said, in return, they got a two-hole earth.

02:17.866 --> 02:23.191
and that you made out like you didn't know they were gonna get your outhouse, but you arranged it.

02:24.932 --> 02:31.238
Were there any injuries that you remember of any importance during Bonfire your four years?

02:31.298 --> 02:33.720
I can't remember any significant injuries.

02:33.760 --> 02:38.684
There probably were some, but I can't remember any.

02:39.385 --> 02:47.232
Did you and your buddies think that Bonfire was fun, or was it more of a chore?

02:47.971 --> 02:51.056
We liked it, but I think we saw it as a chore too.

02:51.176 --> 03:00.471
That guarding thing, that round-the-clock guarding business kind of got to us, and it was always cold and wet, it seemed.

03:01.974 --> 03:04.338
But, you know, we turned out for bonfire.

03:04.418 --> 03:08.865
We liked it, and it got everyone hyped up.

03:08.845 --> 03:15.532
Pinky Downs was always there and tell his stories, and that was kind of the highlight, as I remember, Pinky Downs.

03:15.552 --> 03:17.574
And was old Army Lou around in that era?

03:17.594 --> 03:17.834
Yes.

03:18.555 --> 03:20.277
Did you ever borrow any money from him?

03:20.637 --> 03:28.105
Never borrowed any money from him, but I remember him very well, his store up at Northgate and going in there.

03:28.165 --> 03:34.532
And, you know, he had a reputation then with Aggies that he wasâ€¦ Where did you buy your books?

03:34.833 --> 03:42.008
I bought used books all the time, usually at the bookstores like Lupo's.

03:42.028 --> 03:48.681
That's where I got most of my books and then, you know, would sell them, trade them in usually at the end.

03:49.483 --> 03:54.613
Now, as you get serious about this young lady, to what

03:54.965 --> 03:58.832
A&M activities did you bring her before you all got married?

03:58.872 --> 03:59.433
Do you remember?

04:00.054 --> 04:01.617
She came down several times.

04:03.200 --> 04:09.952
We'd have military ball and the Air Force ball and we had a number of formal balls.

04:10.112 --> 04:13.298
I say formal, I don't know that we'd call it formal.

04:13.318 --> 04:16.804
I guess it was formal but everybody dressed up.

04:16.784 --> 04:22.894
And we put on our uniform, and Cebisa was quite a place for dances.

04:23.474 --> 04:28.562
And the Aggieland Inn was up there then, and she stayed at the Aggieland Inn a few times.

04:29.644 --> 04:40.321
It was a nice place and convenient, but she came down several times for social kind of things, came down for graduation, final review, I believe.

04:40.761 --> 04:43.045
Maybe not final review, but graduation.

04:43.379 --> 04:46.824
Did you all have big bands, some of the big national bands?

04:46.844 --> 04:47.124
Yes.

04:47.705 --> 04:50.268
My senior ring dance, we had Russ Morgan.

04:50.308 --> 04:54.814
Now, people today may not know who Russ Morgan was, but he's big time.

04:55.275 --> 04:57.718
But we had the big bands here from time to time.

04:58.740 --> 05:03.886
And at those, the ladies were treated like queens.

05:03.926 --> 05:04.427
Yes.

05:04.447 --> 05:10.315
And how did the males behave otherwise at the dances?

05:11.071 --> 05:11.952
Nobody got drunk.

05:12.293 --> 05:13.374
I don't remember any of that.

05:13.474 --> 05:18.480
I thought to, I don't remember any bad conduct at these balls and dances.

05:18.560 --> 05:23.887
They were pretty first class things and people seemed to enjoy themselves and behave themselves.

05:23.907 --> 05:24.708
What about smoke?

05:24.949 --> 05:26.751
They didn't smoke inside Sabisa.

05:26.771 --> 05:27.532
I don't remember that.

05:27.812 --> 05:28.453
I don't believe so.

05:29.334 --> 05:30.556
I think that's correct.

05:30.576 --> 05:32.198
I don't remember any smoking in there.

05:32.338 --> 05:36.403
Did any of the campus leadership come to these dances?

05:40.805 --> 05:45.931
Like, do you remember whether the commandant came or the president or the deans?

05:46.212 --> 05:49.756
I can't remember, but I would think they did, but I don't know.

05:50.337 --> 05:52.019
I have not asked anybody.

05:52.039 --> 05:52.820
I don't know.

05:53.261 --> 05:54.903
Were there any former students?

05:57.106 --> 05:59.128
I don't remember outside.

05:59.148 --> 06:08.500
You know, it was difficult to come here in those days, and we were pretty isolated in ways, but I don't remember any outside troublemakers here.

06:08.952 --> 06:10.073
people interfering.

06:11.295 --> 06:23.809
The dances that I remember going to were very nice events and people I thought were well-behaved, but I just don't remember a single incident.

06:24.430 --> 06:29.655
I'm not saying there weren't because I didn't go to all of them, but things that I remember were very nice.

06:29.796 --> 06:32.579
Now, your Aggie Pride started almost from day one.

06:33.800 --> 06:34.261
Is that right?

06:34.281 --> 06:34.741
My Aggie?

06:35.082 --> 06:35.502
Pride.

06:35.682 --> 06:36.103
Oh, yes.

06:36.523 --> 06:38.065
Before I got here, in fact.

06:38.416 --> 06:45.170
Try to describe what it was that contributed to that growth and development.

06:46.834 --> 06:56.695
Well, the military was big in those days and the wars and having this good looking uniform.

06:57.535 --> 07:17.737
And being part of something I thought had earned a lot of respect, Texas A&M and the Corps and the reputation here, its contributions to World War II and so forth, all of that had a big impact on me.

07:17.797 --> 07:21.682
I was telling you about sitting there in Guyon Hall just feeling so good.

07:21.782 --> 07:22.683
I was impressed.

07:23.844 --> 07:26.547
You know, here I am.

07:27.640 --> 07:40.721
But I thought generally the people I was associated with were good folks and the university to me was warm and receptive.

07:40.801 --> 07:49.055
I thought people wanted to help us, a lot of good people that really would give you the back off their shirt to help you as a student.

07:49.595 --> 07:51.559
Who were some of those?

07:51.679 --> 07:54.964
Give examples of people and what they did.

07:56.075 --> 07:58.558
Well, I remember J.R.

07:58.598 --> 08:09.249
Jackson, one of them, and there was a guy by the name of Spike White, I believe his name was, had quite a reputation around here, student activities.

08:09.269 --> 08:15.135
And this guy that ran the basic division, Cliff Ransdell, I believe his name was.

08:15.756 --> 08:22.042
There was another fellow here that I haven't mentioned that I need to mention was David W. Williams.

08:22.383 --> 08:24.765
He was vice chancellor for agriculture.

08:26.332 --> 08:29.836
He lived here on campus at the time, and I roomed with his son.

08:31.078 --> 08:36.225
His son had graduated from Bryan High School, I believe he was, David W. Williams.

08:36.245 --> 08:38.788
I guess he was a junior, but we called him Dave or Bill.

08:39.869 --> 08:41.952
And he and I roomed together as sophomores.

08:42.833 --> 08:44.656
And we both played on the basketball.

08:44.676 --> 08:49.261
We had almost identical patterns here at A&M.

08:50.183 --> 08:55.950
And David's parents were so warm and generous.

08:56.048 --> 09:02.277
And that was my closest exposure to the university administration was through his father and mother.

09:03.378 --> 09:05.541
And they lived in one of those big old houses over here.

09:06.423 --> 09:13.613
And David would frequently invite me over with him to go to their house for dinner or something.

09:14.474 --> 09:19.722
And his father was a big affable kind of fella, just so kind.

09:19.802 --> 09:25.650
And he helped explain A&M to me probably like no one else that I remember.

09:27.655 --> 09:29.017
but in a very positive way.

09:29.057 --> 09:50.329
Now his father had been, I believe, acting dean of agriculture on occasions, maybe even higher than that, I don't know, but in a interim role, but his father had served overseas, done a lot of overseas work with other countries, but recognized leader in agriculture, but he was vice chancellor, and we had a lot of opportunities to visit.

09:50.349 --> 09:52.212
I remember one time,

09:52.968 --> 09:58.775
that I went with his son, Dave Williams, Bill Williams, over to their house in the World Series.

09:58.795 --> 09:59.235
No, it wasn't.

09:59.255 --> 10:01.197
I guess it was the World Series.

10:01.257 --> 10:04.281
It's when Bobby Thompson hit that famous home run in 1951.

10:04.441 --> 10:09.207
I was sitting at their house and we were listening to that when that happened.

10:09.247 --> 10:10.468
I never will forget that.

10:11.649 --> 10:19.178
But, you know, having that home on campus, you know, campus was so much different in those days.

10:19.833 --> 10:27.744
We'd just walk over there and kind of home away from home there for a little while with them.

10:28.765 --> 10:36.436
But he's a guy that I really respected, admired, helped me understand A&M and through his son, David Williams.

10:36.957 --> 10:40.421
David knew all the stuff about A&M, having lived here and grown up here.

10:40.441 --> 10:41.783
Were there some special teachers?

10:43.285 --> 10:44.006
Special teachers?

10:44.086 --> 10:48.232
They taught you more than just in the classroom?

10:48.412 --> 10:49.654
Oh, absolutely.

10:50.393 --> 10:55.439
David's father was on the Athletic Council.

10:55.599 --> 11:00.024
The Athletic Council carried a pretty big punch back in those days.

11:01.285 --> 11:08.514
And David and I were kind of like the 9th and 10th of the 10th and 11th players on the squad.

11:08.654 --> 11:10.636
I mean, that's kind of the way we ranked.

11:10.656 --> 11:12.879
So we were down there on the end of the bench mostly.

11:15.201 --> 11:16.603
But I remember after the...

11:17.680 --> 11:25.634
Our sophomore year, Dallas A&M Club invited a coach and the team up for a big after-season dinner to honor the team.

11:26.996 --> 11:37.495
And we get up there, and they get up and announce that the Letterman, and David and I are both mentioned as Letterman, I believe.

11:38.116 --> 11:40.599
You know, that's the first we'd heard that we got a letter.

11:40.719 --> 11:46.085
Used to, they didn't letter near, you know, they're just a small group and just a few subs that get a letter.

11:47.106 --> 11:53.854
And we thought, hey, we just found out we announced as a letterman.

11:53.874 --> 11:55.696
That's pretty prestigious, we thought.

11:56.657 --> 12:03.085
Well, later it turned out that we were not, we were not approved as a letterman.

12:03.485 --> 12:05.187
The Athletic Council apparently

12:06.213 --> 12:18.131
had been upset that this premature announcement had been made without their concurrence or something and they did their own thing and they drew the line just short of us.

12:18.151 --> 12:20.774
That's the story I've heard.

12:20.794 --> 12:24.820
But Dr. Williams was on the athletic council.

12:24.881 --> 12:28.626
He was involved in lots of things here.

12:30.074 --> 12:36.711
Who did you turn to for advice about career planning, future goals?

12:37.914 --> 12:41.362
I think all of that was through the Ag Ed Department.

12:41.804 --> 12:42.225
But who?

12:42.245 --> 12:46.395
Jackson, Professor Jackson, Professor Ross.

12:46.882 --> 12:52.114
And then this Major Hub Johnson was ROTC.

12:52.174 --> 12:55.982
He was my military advisor, one that I was very close to.

12:56.122 --> 13:04.561
But those three people, my last two years, I got pretty heavily into the ag ed and practiced teaching, doing all those things.

13:05.022 --> 13:06.325
Where'd you do your practice teaching?

13:06.440 --> 13:08.162
Oh, several different places.

13:08.282 --> 13:08.942
I did some.

13:09.063 --> 13:12.446
I even went to Hamilton one time.

13:13.787 --> 13:14.948
That was very nice.

13:14.968 --> 13:15.829
Just happened to work out.

13:15.849 --> 13:16.710
Just happened to work out.

13:17.771 --> 13:24.557
In Comanche, mostly little places, Rising Star.

13:24.657 --> 13:27.380
Now, you didn't have a car, did you?

13:28.862 --> 13:34.607
My senior year, after I was married,

13:35.667 --> 13:41.574
My wife had a little money saved up, and we spent $400 for a 46 model Ford.

13:41.594 --> 13:42.756
Hey, pretty good.

13:43.417 --> 13:46.821
So my senior year, we were a married student.

13:46.841 --> 13:48.022
We did have that old Ford.

13:49.905 --> 13:53.229
But one of my friends was an ag head major.

13:53.809 --> 13:54.871
We'd go out in teams.

13:54.911 --> 13:58.435
Two of us would go together normally to do our practice teaching.

13:58.415 --> 14:00.137
And my friend had a car.

14:00.417 --> 14:03.581
And I remember going with him one time.

14:03.681 --> 14:05.783
But I'm trying to think.

14:06.084 --> 14:08.426
You know, we do practice teaching.

14:08.446 --> 14:12.771
We usually go out for two weeks, twice a year.

14:14.413 --> 14:17.777
And I did get a teacher's certificate when it was all over from the state.

14:19.319 --> 14:23.764
And you were still at that time thinking your career was going to be in ag education?

14:23.930 --> 14:24.230
Yes.

14:26.874 --> 14:33.523
When did you get your senior, when you got your senior boots, what were they and how much they cost?

14:33.543 --> 14:34.083
Where'd you get them?

14:34.404 --> 14:39.270
I paid $45 for them from a graduating senior.

14:39.851 --> 14:43.095
They were used boots, and I don't believe they were new with him.

14:43.656 --> 14:47.301
They had been, you know, he had bought them, but they had been well-worn.

14:47.882 --> 14:52.047
I don't know how many classes they'd been through.

14:52.870 --> 14:56.896
But anyway, I paid $45 for them and I sold them for $35.

14:57.136 --> 15:02.524
In that era, among your classmates, reckon how many of them bought new boots?

15:05.629 --> 15:09.274
I don't know.

15:09.294 --> 15:11.037
You know, some did and some didn't.

15:11.057 --> 15:13.640
But a lot of them couldn't pass them down.

15:13.660 --> 15:16.625
But the thing was, we didn't wear boots every day of the week.

15:17.346 --> 15:19.088
We only wore them on special occasions.

15:19.369 --> 15:21.612
Was it, but reckon half?

15:22.064 --> 15:22.985
Bought used boots?

15:24.026 --> 15:24.387
Maybe.

15:24.627 --> 15:25.147
I don't know.

15:25.187 --> 15:26.889
There were a lot of them that didn't.

15:27.230 --> 15:29.432
Because you didn't really get that much use out of them.

15:30.173 --> 15:34.918
Unless you were loaded with money, you weren't going to go buy a new set of boots.

15:35.299 --> 15:37.561
And then your ring, how much did it cost?

15:37.581 --> 15:38.002
$25.

15:38.022 --> 15:40.765
And where'd you get that?

15:40.785 --> 15:41.666
Did you earn that $25?

15:41.806 --> 15:47.532
I got it, well, I'm sure that

15:49.267 --> 15:52.676
Out of what resources I had, I was able to come up with $25.

15:52.997 --> 15:56.346
Nobody bought it for me or anything, but I remember it was $25.

15:56.507 --> 16:00.357
I hope you have some Ring stories to share.

16:01.096 --> 16:06.684
like where you were somewhere on the other side of the world and somebody spotted it?

16:06.725 --> 16:11.412
Oh, that's happened many times.

16:11.972 --> 16:18.182
I'd have to think a little bit to come up with anything worth really describing that'd be that.

16:19.123 --> 16:19.985
Have you ever lost it?

16:21.246 --> 16:21.427
No.

16:22.308 --> 16:26.935
Because a few people have had interesting stories where they lost it.

16:27.995 --> 16:29.879
kept it in good shape all these years.

16:29.959 --> 16:31.702
People look at it and they kind of marvel.

16:31.722 --> 16:33.065
Is that your original ring?

16:33.085 --> 16:34.688
Yes, that's my original ring.

16:35.890 --> 16:45.669
A lot of years when I was flying, I did not wear it when you're actually flying because it was against the regulations.

16:45.990 --> 16:48.214
The reason being, if you had to

16:48.312 --> 16:55.480
jump out of an airplane or hustle down the ladder or something, the danger of ripping your finger off.

16:55.560 --> 17:00.765
That was against the policy to wear a ring when you're flying like that.

17:01.006 --> 17:06.392
So, you know, I didn't wear it during no time, but I pretty much worn it all the other times.

17:06.432 --> 17:09.315
But it seemed like I've left it a place or two.

17:09.335 --> 17:14.120
I had a couple of close calls, but, you know, I don't have any story, but, you know, it shows up.

17:14.260 --> 17:16.142
Why are Aggie rings so treasured?

17:18.637 --> 17:19.699
That's a good question.

17:20.079 --> 17:27.652
And it is a treasured thing.

17:27.732 --> 17:42.957
I don't know anything that people seem to be so dedicated to as they do their ring, but I think it's a symbol of the Aggie pride and spirit and all those things.

17:44.337 --> 17:51.007
There are not many people who get to be seniors that don't feel that and want that thing in the worst way.

17:51.027 --> 17:54.151
I talked to a fellow just yesterday.

17:54.211 --> 17:56.535
You may have had some experience with him.

17:56.555 --> 17:59.920
A guy I got to meet and know, his name is Joe Bax, B-A-X.

18:00.581 --> 18:04.366
Just had his oral yesterday for his Master in History.

18:07.030 --> 18:11.897
But I met this fellow at a... I was speaking at a...

18:12.518 --> 18:17.605
group called, let's see, Sons of the Confederacy or something like that.

18:18.246 --> 18:19.868
They asked me to come over and speak.

18:19.948 --> 18:22.752
Well, this guy just happened to be sitting next to me.

18:22.832 --> 18:23.573
I never met that.

18:23.734 --> 18:27.018
This was three years or more ago, four years.

18:27.098 --> 18:28.500
I'd never met the guy before.

18:28.580 --> 18:32.806
And he told me he lives over here near Anderson, has a ranch over there.

18:32.826 --> 18:33.387
He's a lawyer.

18:35.229 --> 18:37.092
And he had two daughters at A&M.

18:37.112 --> 18:41.378
And we got to know each other pretty well just because we sat next to each other.

18:42.134 --> 18:48.938
He invited me to come over and fish at his place and I don't know where I got to know this fellow, but anyway, he

18:50.504 --> 19:02.903
Graduated from Houston Law School, but he so much wants an Aggie degree, an Aggie ring, and he up and enrolls in history, and he's done so well.

19:03.003 --> 19:03.964
It's unbelievable.

19:04.325 --> 19:05.807
I believe I did meet him.

19:05.827 --> 19:13.018
And this guy got to order his senior ring, I guess, this week, and it was the highlight.

19:14.298 --> 19:18.464
of his, I want to say, recent years of life.

19:18.504 --> 19:22.970
Not that much, but, I mean, it is the central thing with this guy.

19:22.990 --> 19:26.675
I can't tell you how proud he is to have an Aggie ring.

19:28.117 --> 19:28.818
All right.

19:28.838 --> 19:31.742
For you, final review and commencement.

19:31.802 --> 19:37.010
Describe those and those events for you your senior year.

19:37.611 --> 19:38.652
Okay.

19:39.593 --> 19:42.296
In my day, most students graduated on time.

19:43.817 --> 19:45.639
And it was a bit of a stigma if you didn't.

19:47.621 --> 19:51.024
I did graduate on time and as most of my classmates did.

19:54.788 --> 20:04.877
We had a commissioning, seemed like a sort of a private one over somewhere in the military science area somewhere, but we had already signed the paperwork and all of that.

20:06.419 --> 20:08.841
And my graduation

20:10.913 --> 20:12.596
was held in G. Raleigh White.

20:12.997 --> 20:16.043
It was the first event held in G. Raleigh White.

20:17.826 --> 20:21.473
It wasn't fully finished.

20:21.493 --> 20:23.578
There were still some things they had to do.

20:23.598 --> 20:25.902
As I recall, we sat on the concrete

20:27.248 --> 20:30.994
I don't believe where we sat, they had the benches in there yet.

20:31.014 --> 20:38.505
But anyway, they hustled it together, and our graduation on May the 20th, 1954, I believe, was the first event ever held.

20:38.525 --> 20:40.328
It was a huge building.

20:40.348 --> 20:41.690
And I was so impressed.

20:42.551 --> 20:49.602
My folks came, my wife's folks came, and they were there for the graduation, and a very proud day for us.

20:52.446 --> 20:56.412
Was every hand, every name called, every hand shaken?

20:57.860 --> 21:00.464
Did anybody attempt any pranks or jokes?

21:00.704 --> 21:02.126
I don't remember anything like that.

21:02.226 --> 21:05.571
We didn't wear gowns, as I recall.

21:05.611 --> 21:14.864
We had uniform, but I don't remember any one other than normal attire.

21:14.884 --> 21:17.108
I don't remember any graduation attire.

21:18.470 --> 21:21.454
But, you know, the stage party, they did have robes.

21:21.514 --> 21:22.315
I remember that.

21:22.818 --> 21:33.623
And about what percentage, if you can recall, about what percentage of the students who graduated were not in uniform, wore a suit?

21:33.643 --> 21:34.545
Seemed very small.

21:35.487 --> 21:37.351
We were primarily all corps.

21:37.531 --> 21:40.438
Was the commencement speaker somebody you remember?

21:43.810 --> 21:44.351
Some people don't.

21:44.791 --> 21:48.074
I can't remember, but I know you spoke at my son's graduation.

21:49.496 --> 21:50.156
Do you remember that?

21:50.236 --> 21:50.817
I appreciate your memory.

21:50.837 --> 21:51.357
Oh, you bet.

21:51.418 --> 21:53.119
Let me tell you the year and see if I'm right.

21:53.399 --> 21:54.300
It's been 1980.

21:54.601 --> 21:55.241
That's right.

21:55.261 --> 21:55.742
That's right.

21:56.202 --> 21:56.803
Let me turn this.

21:57.203 --> 21:59.225
All right, we're talking about your commencement.

22:00.987 --> 22:06.873
Then you've got family and wife, and then after that you go for commissioning.

22:07.573 --> 22:09.515
Was there a commissioning speaker then?

22:10.516 --> 22:13.159
I believe we did.

22:14.033 --> 22:16.217
Or was there an important reviewing officer?

22:16.237 --> 22:18.160
No celebrity?

22:18.180 --> 22:23.710
I don't remember a reviewing officer, but, you know, what we normally do, I assume that was the case then.

22:23.850 --> 22:29.079
The commissioning officer really would be the reviewing officer as well.

22:29.280 --> 22:34.429
But I'd have to go back and check who my commissioning officer was.

22:35.190 --> 22:39.197
I know who signed my commissioning certificate in General Dissusway.

22:39.633 --> 22:43.038
who was head of the training command at the time, Air Training Command.

22:43.379 --> 22:44.140
Spell his name.

22:44.160 --> 22:49.909
D-I-S-O-S-W-A-Y, Disosway, something like that.

22:51.812 --> 22:57.581
How well prepared did you feel you were for going out into the real world?

22:57.861 --> 23:00.565
What kind of job at A&M done in preparing you?

23:02.468 --> 23:07.275
Well, I felt ready to go assume a teaching job or a county agent job.

23:07.456 --> 23:08.357
I felt

23:09.518 --> 23:17.617
I'd been prepared well to do that with my background and all the 4-H and FFA work I'd done.

23:17.817 --> 23:19.922
I felt comfortable doing that.

23:20.383 --> 23:25.114
I didn't have any question about it and being prepared.

23:25.533 --> 23:30.420
and fully expected to do that, you know, after my military tour was over.

23:31.061 --> 23:37.590
Did you, were you at commencement time, did you already have orders to report for active duty?

23:37.770 --> 23:37.850
Yes.

23:37.870 --> 23:39.132
When were you to report?

23:39.152 --> 23:40.254
July the 7th.

23:40.274 --> 23:40.574
Where?

23:41.335 --> 23:44.740
To San Antonio initially for two weeks of

23:45.344 --> 23:49.130
indoctrination and so forth, and then on to flying school, pilot training.

23:49.230 --> 23:50.672
Where was it going to be or did you not?

23:50.692 --> 23:51.874
Yeah, Marana, Arizona.

23:52.636 --> 23:56.241
They did it under a civilian contract program then.

23:57.123 --> 24:03.673
And a little airfield north of Tucson, that's where the famous Osprey crashed last year, that little air base.

24:03.833 --> 24:08.741
Now, did you feel that you, that A&M had prepared you well for?

24:08.801 --> 24:12.567
The Air Force?

24:14.521 --> 24:24.300
You know, it seemed like the ROTC courses were such a broad brush, I didn't feel I had a real good grasp of all of that.

24:25.242 --> 24:28.768
But later I found out they weren't trying to teach me all of that.

24:29.610 --> 24:33.778
You know, some years before they'd gone into a broader

24:34.754 --> 24:43.973
program rather than trying to teach, especially like in Army ROTC, we don't have infantry and artillery programs anymore.

24:43.993 --> 24:45.557
It's one broad course.

24:46.158 --> 24:50.046
There, the services are trying to find an officer that's

24:50.026 --> 24:57.054
has a good education, preferably a technical person, but they want someone that they can make something out of.

24:57.574 --> 25:00.537
They don't expect you to know all this when you come in.

25:00.618 --> 25:04.762
But I felt okay as far as going into the service.

25:05.703 --> 25:10.088
I had a lot of questions and things I didn't know.

25:10.108 --> 25:19.358
I remember going over to, driving over to San Antonio for my first day and I check in there and there was some other guy

25:19.912 --> 25:23.156
checking in there, kind of a tall, blond-haired fellow.

25:23.897 --> 25:29.344
Later I went to flying school with him, but he was from West Virginia, he told me.

25:29.364 --> 25:31.086
And I said, well, where'd you go to college?

25:31.106 --> 25:32.929
Well, he went to Davis and Elkins.

25:33.349 --> 25:35.612
I'd never heard of Davis and Elkins.

25:36.513 --> 25:38.696
But it's up in the hills of West Virginia.

25:38.716 --> 25:43.863
And he was a West Virginia hillbilly, but, you know, good guy.

25:43.903 --> 25:49.750
But that was my first encounter of how much diversity

25:50.000 --> 25:56.550
I was going to find, you know, people from all over the country and different things.

25:56.570 --> 26:08.127
I do remember going through flying school and it got pretty technical there, all the ground school part teaching us about engineering and weather and all these things.

26:09.338 --> 26:26.571
It was a program where we had to pass the test every so often and I thought the exams were pretty tough and I was in a class, my pilot training class was about half West Pointers and Naval Academy graduates and then people from all over the country.

26:27.332 --> 26:32.342
A few of us Aggies in there, but I will say that I found that

26:33.352 --> 26:39.699
I had to hustle more to stay at the top of the class than I had at A&M and what I'd been through.

26:40.821 --> 26:50.272
I don't know if I'd explain all that, but I did find that I was suddenly in with some pretty cream of the crop kind of fellas.

26:50.592 --> 26:53.896
Try to think in general terms.

26:54.237 --> 26:59.663
As you look back on your life, what did you learn here at A&M?

26:59.879 --> 27:01.922
attitudes, values, qualities?

27:02.343 --> 27:03.185
What did A&M?

27:04.246 --> 27:19.913
I was a rather shy fellow that felt like I was not, you know, in the upper sphere socially and economically, and I felt I'd got on a par.

27:20.602 --> 27:22.766
that A&M had given me that chance.

27:22.886 --> 27:24.528
It brought me out of my shell.

27:25.149 --> 27:30.759
And I remember ROTC courses and leadership labs and leading the troops out there.

27:31.480 --> 27:38.391
You know, the first time they told me, you go out there and march this squad or whatever it is and give them the commands and all.

27:39.198 --> 27:48.957
But all of that helped bring me out of the shell, the shyness and the hesitancy that I had back in those days.

27:49.678 --> 27:53.506
I think it helped make me, maybe arrogant, but say a leader.

27:54.548 --> 27:56.852
It helped move me toward that.

27:57.929 --> 28:09.382
The pride, the determination, learning perseverance about sticking with things, being on time, being punctual, staying awake.

28:11.284 --> 28:14.448
A&M did a good job on all those things in my opinion.

28:15.990 --> 28:18.973
It gave me a sense of pride and belonging.

28:19.574 --> 28:23.278
I felt part of something big and good.

28:23.950 --> 28:31.458
What are the events at A&M during a student's experience that most contribute to this pride?

28:35.142 --> 28:37.985
In today's world or back then?

28:38.626 --> 28:39.126
In yours.

28:45.013 --> 28:46.314
Like I'm assuming the core.

28:46.454 --> 28:49.097
The core, absolutely, being part of a unit.

28:49.758 --> 28:53.822
And, you know, they have goals and objectives and they try to build teamwork

28:54.545 --> 28:56.007
I learned something in that.

28:56.027 --> 29:03.355
That made me feel good, but I think just being associated with A&M made me feel good from the first.

29:04.096 --> 29:07.120
I had such respect for it that I'd learned from others.

29:07.901 --> 29:18.493
But are events like silver taps, mustard, bonfire, commencement, final review, are those significant in building this

29:18.693 --> 29:20.456
I think they are today.

29:20.476 --> 29:23.822
I don't think they were as significant then as they are today.

29:23.902 --> 29:26.888
You know, we went through those things.

29:26.948 --> 29:30.073
Sometimes we were kind of going through the motions, I'm afraid.

29:30.113 --> 29:36.685
Those things have developed their own character and significance, I think.

29:37.340 --> 29:41.289
to a much greater extent over the last 50 years.

29:43.113 --> 29:49.086
Muster is developed to a much deeper, more personal kind of thing than it was.

29:49.167 --> 29:56.884
And we talked about it, but you know, it was in its earlier stages, I guess, and we just hadn't developed that sense of what that was all about.

29:57.185 --> 30:02.074
Yell practice, to say that was a great motivator, I wouldn't say so.

30:02.515 --> 30:04.018
You know, it was one of those things we had to do.

30:05.481 --> 30:09.007
And yell practice still doesn't turn me on very much.

30:09.027 --> 30:10.610
It really doesn't.

30:11.372 --> 30:16.341
Midnight yell practice, I went one time when I came back to A&M and I said, that's the last time.

30:16.912 --> 30:18.134
I haven't been back.

30:19.235 --> 30:24.682
But some people, some of my friends and all think ill practice, midnight ill practice, just such a wonderful thing.

30:25.303 --> 30:29.969
It's frankly what I saw was debasing and repulsive.

30:31.330 --> 30:42.244
If you were a consultant to the A&M leadership today, what advice would you give them about how to guide A&M in the future?

30:48.029 --> 30:50.151
What advice would I give to whom now?

30:50.391 --> 30:53.414
The A&M leadership.

30:53.434 --> 30:55.376
About what it should be doing.

30:55.436 --> 30:56.397
What it should be doing.

30:56.557 --> 30:58.099
What it should be trying to do.

31:00.921 --> 31:10.510
Well, I think we have to, and this is, you know, what I think most of us are saying and thinking these days, you know, we've got to think broader globally.

31:12.753 --> 31:16.416
We have to be prepared to deal with the

31:16.733 --> 31:23.244
people of different ethnic backgrounds, women and men.

31:24.046 --> 31:25.208
I fought hard here.

31:25.328 --> 31:38.370
I stepped out and took the lead in integrating the Corps and trying to make women, give women a bigger role and opportunity at A&M and, golly, what fierce opposition I had on that.
