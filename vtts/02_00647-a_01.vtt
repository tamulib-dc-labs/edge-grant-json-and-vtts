1976, 9 a.m.

00:03.001 --> 00:15.196
in the morning.

00:15.216 --> 00:31.557
Interviewee,

00:15.216 --> 00:31.557
Russell

00:15.216 --> 00:31.557
R-U-S-S-E-L-L Watson, W-A-T-S-O-N, Raitt, 
R-A-I-T-T. place, Scripps Institute of

00:32.600 --> 00:38.467
Oceanography, University of California.

00:50.763 --> 00:55.369
Professor Raitt, would you first tell us when and 
how you first developed an interest in the sea?

00:56.751 --> 01:01.797
Well, I think it began when I was doing wartime 
research at Point Loma. during World War II when I

01:02.266 --> 01:12.936
was engaged in undersea warfare research in an 
attempt to do something about submarine warfare.

01:12.976 --> 01:26.728
Then it became clear that there was very 
inadequate knowledge about the ocean and that

01:12.976 --> 01:26.728
some of my research ability could be useful. Now 
you had earlier worked, had you not, In the

01:32.337 --> 01:33.458
Engineering Corps? No, not in the Engineering 
Corps, if you mean in the military. No, no, I mean

01:39.443 --> 01:42.086
seismograph. I had worked for five years doing 
geophysical exploration using seismic

01:42.206 --> 01:53.816
reflection technique. And then from there, then 
you went on to work in war research. What took you to

01:57.740 --> 01:59.041
war research? I think it was... recognition that 
the U.S. would be involved in the war sooner or

02:01.582 --> 02:19.970
later, and it was necessary for people with 
technical knowledge to come to some help in

02:01.582 --> 02:19.970
dealing with the situation, particularly the 
submarine. German submarines were sinking,

02:21.052 --> 02:29.665
shipping across the Atlantic very rapidly, and if 
it continued very long, that England would have

02:30.286 --> 02:33.570
been completely isolated. So they formed a 
laboratory down here at Point Loma, National

02:34.551 --> 02:40.739
Defense Research Committee. And, well, I heard 
about that through my connections with Caltech.

02:50.071 --> 02:53.115
And so I joined them in the summer of 1941. What were 
you doing with Caltech? I had some indirect

02:58.720 --> 03:15.866
association with them because my work in 
geophysics was working with a company in which the

02:58.720 --> 03:15.866
other members of the company were also graduates 
of Caltech. And I had friends there. I had no direct

03:21.294 --> 03:27.343
association with Caltech in the sense of being on 
the staff or anything like that. Did any of the work

03:28.370 --> 03:32.896
you did with the Geophysical Engineering Corps 
direct you towards the sea? Yeah, that was

03:33.017 --> 03:34.899
Engineering Corporation. Geophysical 
Engineering Corporation was engaged entirely in

03:34.999 --> 03:45.334
doing exploratory seismic reflection work 
looking for oil structures. It had nothing to do

03:45.995 --> 03:47.918
with working the sea. Who organized the research 
after you arrived at Point Loma? Well, the

03:55.825 --> 04:04.435
director at that time was Vern Knudson, professor 
of physics at UCLA.

04:06.917 --> 04:14.385
Did you propose the work you did with underwater 
sound and impulse waves yourself, or were they

04:06.917 --> 04:14.385
predetermined missions? No, I was working. I was, 
as all of us there were, really working on projects

04:15.667 --> 04:24.837
that were We were

04:25.508 --> 04:33.839
working on the program of the laboratory. The 
responsibility of the laboratory was to do

04:33.879 --> 04:50.200
whatever seemed most appropriate for our 
experience and the problems most appropriate to

04:50.888 --> 04:55.475
to learn as rapidly as possible those things that 
would be useful in undersea warfare. So I

04:56.376 --> 05:03.707
particularly was working on assigned projects, 
not things that I initiated myself. Of course, the

05:04.308 --> 05:12.500
ideas of how to do it and so on came from the people 
that were carrying out the work. But we generally

05:12.520 --> 05:20.592
worked on projects that were requested by the 
management. Did you notice a goodly number of

05:23.705 --> 05:31.315
people coming through this sort of work in the war 
to move on into the field of oceanography after the

05:23.705 --> 05:31.315
war was over? Quite a few of them, yes, like myself, 
whose interest in oceanography developed

05:31.435 --> 05:44.911
through this work that they came in from other 
fields but continued on in oceanography. Yes, I

05:44.951 --> 05:46.393
was not the only one. Did you feel, or do you feel, as 
if the connection between oceanography and

05:47.858 --> 05:54.167
military has been beneficial for oceanography? I 
think so. Yes, and on the whole, the

05:57.071 --> 06:10.710
relationship

05:57.071 --> 06:10.710
with the military has been beneficial in a number 
of ways. Did you think that perhaps in your contact

06:12.817 --> 06:24.452
with the military, let's say particularly later 
on, the military might have been too

06:12.817 --> 06:24.452
mission-oriented vis-a-vis, let's say, hard 
science in terms of projects it funded? That's

06:27.016 --> 06:30.320
possible about some of the work, maybe. Some of the 
R&D, government R&D, probably is too much

06:30.941 --> 06:37.630
mission-oriented. My contact is in two phases. 
One is the phase where I was doing work in wartime.

06:47.487 --> 07:02.405
The emphasis naturally was mission-oriented 
then, and it was only a recognition of the

06:47.487 --> 07:02.405
deficiency of knowledge about the ocean that led 
me to continue later. Later, after the war, the

07:02.845 --> 07:09.874
work I've been doing is not mission-oriented at 
all. It's research, fundamental research, and

07:10.192 --> 07:20.783
there's quite a difference there between the 
wartime work and the post-war work. Would you

07:20.803 --> 07:30.272
comment at least upon the discovery of the deep 
scattering layer, speaking of pure research, how

07:20.803 --> 07:30.272
it came about, with whom you were associated? Yes, 
I participated in that directly, and it came about

07:31.794 --> 07:39.642
because one of the first assignments I had was to 
learn about the scattering that came out of the sea

07:40.364 --> 08:07.587
because this was directly interfering with the 
detection of submarines by echo ranging and this

07:40.364 --> 08:07.587
is the scattering that comes through organisms 
that are diffusely scattered throughout the sea

07:40.364 --> 08:07.587
not just things like whales and fish and so on that 
give discrete echoes give a general scattering,

08:08.461 --> 08:20.737
which sounds very much like the reverberation 
that you hear in an auditorium when a sound is

08:08.461 --> 08:20.737
emitted in an auditorium, it's reflected back and 
forth and dies away. The sound that you get out of

08:20.777 --> 08:27.906
the sea when you send a pulse into it sounds very 
much like that, so they call it reverberation. So

08:28.287 --> 08:33.313
we were studying reverberation because it was 
interfering with the detection of submarines.

08:33.414 --> 08:38.400
When we directed an extrasonic projector into the 
ocean, to study the volume reverberation, we

08:39.005 --> 08:52.145
directed it vertically downwards in order to 
eliminate the reverberation that came out of the

08:39.005 --> 08:52.145
surface, which is separate from that that came out 
of volume. As soon as we did that, we found that the

08:52.325 --> 09:00.899
scattering was not uniformly distributed 
throughout the scene. Before that, everyone more

09:00.919 --> 09:06.447
or less assumed that there was something 
scattering there that was uniformly

09:00.919 --> 09:06.447
distributed. As soon as we put it downward, we saw 
immediately that there were layers. And that came

09:13.444 --> 09:20.571
very early in the study of reverberation out of the 
sea. So that was, in a sense, a scientific

09:21.152 --> 09:36.467
discovery that was completely unexpected and a 
byproduct of work which was directed towards a

09:21.152 --> 09:36.467
practical study of reverberation. You keep 
saying we. With whom were you involved? Well, I

09:40.825 --> 09:47.695
was, as everybody else working there, was 
involved in some sort of group activity. And the

09:48.075 --> 09:58.010
group I worked with was led by Dr. Eyring.

09:58.130 --> 10:00.033
There were two Eyrings. I think his name was Carl 
Eyring. He's a physicist from Utah, Brigham Young

10:01.996 --> 10:07.163
University. The other man was Ralph Christensen. 
Irene Christensen and myself were working

10:13.764 --> 10:19.671
together studying reverberation. So this was a 
joint activity, not any one person was

10:21.072 --> 10:28.561
responsible for it. Did you suspect at that time 
that it was caused by masses of fish and animals, or

10:29.702 --> 10:37.791
was this...? Yes, I think there, let's see, at that 
time, there was a vast ignorance, and no one

10:38.665 --> 10:53.779
really

10:38.665 --> 10:53.779
knew for sure. Even then, it wasn't certain

10:54.200 --> 11:08.233
what it came from, whether it was from organisms 
living in the sea or from some structure of the sea

10:54.200 --> 11:08.233
itself. However, I think very quickly it became 
apparent that it wasn't the structure of the water

11:08.990 --> 11:18.403
itself, but it was the organism. I think the fact of 
the deep scattering layer was the strongest

11:18.484 --> 11:38.372
single thing showing that because the scattering 
layer

11:18.484 --> 11:38.372
existed fairly deep in the ocean where the water 
structure is fairly uniform Scattering from

11:38.808 --> 11:45.113
areas where there's more layering, like the 
thermocline, was much smaller. So there were

11:46.194 --> 11:50.058
various things that indicated it was... I think 
the strongest indication was biological and was

11:50.078 --> 12:00.046
that the scattering layer moved up and down 
diurnally.

12:00.066 --> 12:04.030
And it came up at night and went down during the day. 
And which is well known... vertical migration of

12:08.153 --> 12:12.178
plankton and other small fish and so on. Well, was 
vertical migration known at this time? Yes. Yes, I

12:16.523 --> 12:32.082
think Martin Johnson was the one who was most 
influential in pointing that out because he had

12:16.523 --> 12:32.082
studied the vertical migration of plankton by 
taking plankton net studies and so on. So he was

12:32.182 --> 12:35.106
aware of this diurnal migration of the organisms 
and see, and he was also at the laboratory, not at

12:35.828 --> 12:52.555
first, he wasn't there quite as early as I was, but 
he came later on from Scripps Institution and

12:35.828 --> 12:52.555
joined the same laboratory. He's here now, by the 
way, if you want to talk to him. Did the discovery

12:57.803 --> 13:00.908
aid your individual research? Did this discovery 
of scattering layers move you more firmly into

13:01.445 --> 13:06.371
oceanography? Perhaps, yes. It was an exciting 
thing to happen and certainly it makes the field

13:10.196 --> 13:23.733
more interesting when you find that with fairly 
simple experiments you can make fundamental

13:10.196 --> 13:23.733
discoveries. The joy in scientific research is 
making discoveries and so that So this is kind of

13:30.925 --> 13:34.689
the motivation that led me into oceanography. It 
was such a wide open field that one could go out

13:35.169 --> 13:43.358
almost any direction and discover new knowledge. 
And so that was an interesting time to get into

13:43.478 --> 13:47.362
oceanography. It's been suggested that the 1950s 
and early 60s were, in effect, the age of

13:48.163 --> 13:55.230
exploration as far as oceanography was 
concerned. And this might now be closing off.

13:58.786 --> 14:07.154
that, quite frankly, more oceanography may be 
done away from vessels and on land as oceanography

13:58.786 --> 14:07.154
becomes a more particular rather than broad 
field. Would you agree with that? Well, let's see.

14:10.457 --> 14:22.187
I think oceanography will continue a study of the 
oceans by ships going out into the ocean. The age

14:23.008 --> 14:28.793
of, let's see, the first exploration, I think, or 
the age of geophysical exploration of the ocean is

14:29.549 --> 14:35.775
still continuing. But it's past this initial 
phase, which is similar. The thing that we got

14:42.541 --> 14:56.113
into, in a sense, was almost similar to the period 
of the 16th century exploration of the oceans that

14:42.541 --> 14:56.113
started with Europeans like Columbus and other 
people going out. But the exploration is still

14:56.133 --> 14:58.695
continuing. And new things are still being found. 
And I think it'll be a long time before you can study

15:03.210 --> 15:09.058
oceans by sitting in a desk.

15:13.223 --> 15:19.651
Some people have suggested that to be a good 
oceanographer, it's necessary, in effect, to get

15:13.223 --> 15:19.651
your feet wet to go out on vessels. Do you agree with 
that?

15:23.316 --> 15:24.838
Well, I don't. I don't. Maybe it's not. It isn't... 
Maybe it isn't necessary for every oceanographer

15:29.978 --> 15:35.006
to get his feet wet, but some of them sure do. 
Otherwise, oceanography is an experimental

15:35.507 --> 15:40.614
science. Everything that's been learned about 
the sea is learned by somebody going out into the

15:40.634 --> 15:48.687
ocean and observing it. And the people, however, 
that have worked with data that's made very

15:56.219 --> 16:04.930
fundamentally useful contributions to 
understanding the data that's taken by people

15:56.219 --> 16:04.930
that make observations.

16:07.533 --> 16:11.458
Now, why did you and four others form the Marine 
Physical Lab? Oh,

16:13.220 --> 16:23.172
that's not an absolutely simple question to 
answer there. There are aspects of that that

16:24.502 --> 16:41.552
involve, let's say, the

16:24.502 --> 16:41.552
whole subject of why it was desirable to support 
research in oceanography.

16:45.258 --> 16:49.125
The Marine Physical Laboratory was one of a number 
of, let's say, quite a number of efforts to, let's

16:49.966 --> 17:02.279
say, to carry out this need for research in 
oceanography. And it came into being through Navy

17:03.180 --> 17:15.113
support and recognition by people in the Navy that

17:16.460 --> 17:20.467
that more fundamental research was needed in 
oceanography. Marine Physical Laboratory was

17:21.729 --> 17:34.910
set up to emphasize those aspects of oceanography 
that are associated with the propagation of sound

17:21.729 --> 17:34.910
in the sea. And, however, this was not, it wasn't It 
wasn't oriented towards application of

17:44.000 --> 17:58.374
underwater sound, but rather to

17:44.000 --> 17:58.374
understand the fundamental properties of the 
ocean that were related to the propagation of

17:44.000 --> 17:58.374
underwater sound. Understand? And how it came, 
the details of how it came into being is a fairly

18:02.478 --> 18:12.387
complex story, which I don't have all of the 
answers to it, although I may have remembered it at

18:12.890 --> 18:18.617
one time in the past. But I think quite a bit of this 
is written up, the details of how the Marine

18:18.677 --> 18:26.606
Physical Laboratory came into being. And the main

18:27.647 --> 18:39.741
person, of course, involved in that and would not 
have come into being if he hadn't taken a very

18:40.447 --> 18:43.290
active and aggressive role, and that was Carl 
Eckert. And he was the important person in the

18:44.371 --> 18:47.954
Marine Physical Laboratory. And I was one of the 
people that was fortunate enough to become

18:48.575 --> 18:56.042
associated with him in the formation of the 
laboratory. How did you meet Carl Eckert? And I met

18:58.804 --> 19:07.673
him first in this wartime laboratory, which I 
mentioned right at the beginning of the

18:58.804 --> 19:07.673
interview. I met him very shortly after I joined 
there in the summer of 1941. He came from the

19:12.674 --> 19:16.059
University of Chicago. And

19:16.099 --> 19:32.362
then after, would you agree with this, as the war is 
winding down, it becomes apparent that more pure

19:16.099 --> 19:32.362
research has to be done in the sea, and from this, 
then, the marine physical lab evolves? That was

19:33.403 --> 19:34.084
it. It was a strong feeling of a number of people, 
both in the academic world and in the Navy, that the

19:37.501 --> 20:05.567
research that really began during the war should

19:37.501 --> 20:05.567
be continued, particularly in those fields which 
had been opened up during the war but on which no

19:37.501 --> 20:05.567
work really could be done because the emphasis had 
the necessity to be placed during the war on the

20:05.918 --> 20:11.065
application of knowledge rather than on the 
acquisition of knowledge.

20:13.968 --> 20:19.676
The Marine Physical Laboratory, was it funded by 
the Office of Naval Research?

20:20.216 --> 20:26.725
There was no Office of Naval Research at the time 
Marine Physical Laboratory was formed. So the

20:27.666 --> 20:31.791
funds initially came from the Bureau of Ships.

20:35.652 --> 20:42.580
Now, what types of information about the bottom 
were you able to gather as a result of techniques

20:35.652 --> 20:42.580
you developed with sound transmissions?

20:46.265 --> 20:47.647
Well, let's see.

20:50.650 --> 20:59.541
All of our knowledge, I think, of the ocean bottom 
is gained through that kind of technique, this use

20:50.650 --> 20:59.541
of underwater sound. All of the information comes 
by studying the reflection of sound. from the sea

21:04.728 --> 21:14.825
bottom or from layers underneath the sea bottom, 
or by propagation through the sea bottom that we

21:04.728 --> 21:14.825
call refraction. So basically there are two 
fields here of study, one called the reflection of

21:14.906 --> 21:26.145
sound, the other refraction of sound.

21:27.290 --> 21:53.567
This is, I

21:27.290 --> 21:53.567
think, what shows the association between the 
knowledge of the sea floor, the structure of the

21:27.290 --> 21:53.567
sea floor, and the propagation of sand is that we 
learn a good deal about the nature of the sea bottom

21:27.290 --> 21:53.567
by studying the underwater sand at the same time 
one gains a good deal of knowledge about how sound

21:54.290 --> 22:02.159
is propagated by learning about what flies 
beneath the sea floor. It's a very important part

22:02.179 --> 22:05.363
of the whole problem.

22:09.307 --> 22:10.489
When did you come to Scripps? Well, the transition 
to Scripps was a gradual one. I started at the end of

22:16.015 --> 22:22.002
the war in the Marine Physical Laboratory, was a 
branch then, or in a sense, a division or a

22:22.184 --> 22:33.980
laboratory

22:22.184 --> 22:33.980
of the University of California, separate from 
Scripps Institution.

22:36.663 --> 22:42.110
As time went on, the relation with Scripps 
Institution became stronger and stronger. And

22:42.170 --> 22:51.803
then

22:42.170 --> 22:51.803
I believe, I can't remember the exact date, 
probably in 49, I got an appointment as associate

22:52.272 --> 22:57.540
professor at Scripps Institution. But my 
association with Scripps began before that,

22:58.301 --> 23:11.019
although I wasn't really part of the academic 
staff or faculty at Scripps. I was still

23:11.039 --> 23:14.344
associated with them. I believe I taught a course 
here in Underwater Sound before I was out. on the

23:22.715 --> 23:23.876
faculty. So the transition was not a dramatic, 
abrupt one, but a gradual one. What happened to the

23:31.445 --> 23:35.349
Marine Physical Laboratory when you came to 
Scripps? Well, it continues and still is in

23:35.369 --> 23:39.434
existence. And because of my

23:40.515 --> 23:50.967
residents here on the campus and other people from 
Marine Physical Laboratory, a branch,

23:51.503 --> 24:01.012
essentially, of Marine Physical Laboratory here 
on the campus, as well as a continuing activity

23:51.503 --> 24:01.012
down at Point Loma. Well, so then you make a 
transition then from the Marine Physical

24:03.515 --> 24:09.381
Laboratory to be finally full-time at Scripps. 
But I'm still part of the Marine Physical

24:10.301 --> 24:16.988
Laboratory at

24:18.385 --> 24:37.182
even though I'm a member of Scripps on the faculty, 
the research I've been conducting through the

24:18.385 --> 24:37.182
Marine Physical Laboratory, which is a research 
division, in a sense, of Scripps Institutional

24:18.385 --> 24:37.182
Oceanography.

24:39.725 --> 24:45.490
Now, had you always been interested in teaching, 
or did the teaching at Scripps develop, let's say,

24:46.617 --> 24:49.621
in addition to research? My teaching is really 
research. I teach whatever effectiveness I have,

24:54.147 --> 25:05.141
and teaching is owing to maybe graduate students 
learning how to do research for me. I'm not a

25:05.182 --> 25:15.375
teacher in the sense of lecturing to students, but 
rather one in which helping them with research

25:05.182 --> 25:15.375
problems. Now, when you came to Scripps, how large 
was the faculty here? Do you remember? That would

25:23.887 --> 25:25.409
be hard for me to say. I think you'd better look that 
up. It would be, of course, much smaller than it is

25:29.695 --> 25:33.039
now. Well, it'll roughly quadruple while you're 
here. And as it quadruples, what happens in terms

25:36.944 --> 25:45.175
of sound transmission, working seismology? Does 
it do it? Do you seem to give direction to that part

25:46.945 --> 25:50.328
of the extension of the faculty? The whole field 
has changed. And

25:57.255 --> 26:16.092
let's say

25:57.255 --> 26:16.092
my own involvement in what I call seismic methods 
of study came from the, let's say, from the sound

26:16.696 --> 26:19.559
aspect. However, that's not generally true. And 
most people getting into this field do it the other

26:22.882 --> 26:35.995
way, from being directly interested in seismic 
work and then applying that to the ocean. So

26:36.656 --> 26:45.825
let's say there is a seismology involved here on 
the campus, for example. and of a more, you might

26:45.957 --> 26:52.305
say, more of a classical seismology. Professor 
Bruhn, for example, is a leading member of that

26:52.906 --> 26:59.594
field. He's been president of the Seismological 
Society of America. And there are other people at

27:03.860 --> 27:13.652
the Institute of Geophysics and Planetary 
Physics, IGPP, who are worldwide prominent in

27:14.138 --> 27:27.597
this field of seismology, which is really dry land 
seismology in a sense, but it's evolved from the

27:14.138 --> 27:27.597
land, but it's also getting more involved into the 
ocean. So there's this approach from really two

27:27.637 --> 27:42.559
different directions, from the idea of sound 
propagation, one hand, and the other, you might

27:27.637 --> 27:42.559
call it continental seismology, earthquake 
seismology, and so on. It's that earthquake

27:43.332 --> 27:50.260
seismology is moving into the ocean. That's one of 
the current developments, very active. And I

27:53.565 --> 28:06.941
think some of the leading work is being done right 
here at Scripps Institution, up at the IGPP, in

27:53.565 --> 28:06.941
that they're putting instruments out on the 
bottom now. Instead of just having them on dry

28:07.602 --> 28:12.748
land, they're putting seismographs. On the 
bottom, study earthquakes.
