WEBVTT

00:03.406 --> 00:07.069
Then we'll try it and see if it works. OK, this is Ron 
Schorn interviewing Carl Sagan on October 19,

00:07.089 --> 00:13.555
1993, at Boulder, Colorado. Now, Carl, for the 
record, would you give us your full name? My name is

00:19.761 --> 00:22.243
Carl Edward Sagan. OK, and when and where were you 
born? November 9, 1934, Brooklyn, New York.

00:30.250 --> 00:33.413
When did you first get interested in astronomy? 
About age five.

00:38.384 --> 00:42.349
What part of astronomy did you get interested in, 
and how did that happen? I describe this in my book,

00:42.569 --> 00:48.858
Cosmos, and it's done much better there than I can 
do it here. It's chapter six, I think. Where did you

00:54.145 --> 00:57.670
go to undergraduate school? I got all my earned 
degrees, all four of them, at the University of

00:57.690 --> 01:01.314
Chicago. When did you get your bachelor's degree? 
I got a BA in 1954 and a BS in physics in 1955. Did you

01:12.564 --> 01:15.368
ever take any astronomy classes as an 
undergraduate? As an undergraduate,

01:16.470 --> 01:23.540
no, I did not. Why did you go to Chicago? I went to 
Chicago because it had the only planetary

01:26.667 --> 01:34.428
astronomer in the United States and I wanted to do 
planets. That was Gerard Kuiper and also because

01:35.009 --> 01:39.040
the physics and chemistry departments were 
extremely good. The names Enrico Fermi and Harold

01:41.745 --> 01:45.408
Urey attracted me. But what I didn't realize is 
that on showing up I was subjecting myself to the

01:46.129 --> 02:08.588
Hutchins

01:46.129 --> 02:08.588
baccalaureate program in which they said that my 
showing up showed that I didn't know any subjects

01:46.129 --> 02:08.588
and therefore it was up to them to tell me what to 
study and so they had 14 year long courses that were

01:46.129 --> 02:08.588
required for the bachelor's degree, which had 
almost nothing to do with professional pursuit of

02:08.922 --> 02:16.470
mathematics, physics, and astronomy. And it was 
the best thing that ever happened to me because I

02:16.950 --> 02:21.575
was too narrowly focused and it broadened me up. 
You'll recall there was a little to-do about some

02:23.097 --> 02:32.526
magazine you mentioned that Kuiper was the only 
practicing planetary astrophysicist in the 50s

02:23.097 --> 02:32.526
or whatever. And someone said, why did you say 
that? And you said, because it's true. Could you

02:35.970 --> 02:37.191
give us the details? Well, I learned this from 
talking to other astronomers, which I did before

02:38.167 --> 02:47.400
going to, you know, before applying. But, you 
know, think about it. Who else was anything close

02:51.146 --> 02:55.332
to full-time planetary astronomer in the United 
States? At the time, not John Strong, Robert

02:55.312 --> 03:05.324
Richardson at Mount Wilson. I just don't think 
there were any others, but there was Kuiper. This

03:11.671 --> 03:13.633
is 1951 I'm talking about. There was Kuiper. It 
just edited the atmospheres of the Earth and

03:14.835 --> 03:21.302
planets. discovered CO2 on Mars, methane on 
Titan, was trying to understand the origin of the

03:21.620 --> 03:40.025
solar system, was involved in theory and 
observation, and was also not completely hostile

03:21.620 --> 03:40.025
to the idea of life elsewhere. So he was going great 
guns, and there was, as far as I know then or now,

03:40.706 --> 03:46.634
nobody else. Were you aware that, let's put it this 
way, at least some part of the astronomical

03:51.775 --> 04:00.365
establishment, anywhere from half to 99%, 
considered planetary astronomy a third-rate

03:51.775 --> 04:00.365
field at that time? I can't remember if I was truly 
aware of that at the time. I certainly became aware

04:06.712 --> 04:11.458
of it quickly thereafter. The

04:11.498 --> 04:19.167
people who I asked for advice, for example, Lyman 
Spitzer at Princeton, did not think planetary

04:19.805 --> 04:28.444
science was a third rate field, maybe in part 
because Lyman had done some planetary science

04:19.805 --> 04:28.444
himself. He was, for example, the source of the 
then primary objection to the Jeans-Jeffries

04:34.452 --> 04:51.567
view of the origin of the solar system by the close 
encounter of two stars, and had also been doing

04:34.452 --> 04:51.567
work on the escape of planetary atmospheres. So 
maybe I had a biased sample, but in any case, by the

04:52.188 --> 05:00.981
time I got to Chicago and talked to some of the 
stellar astronomers there, it got across to me

04:52.188 --> 05:00.981
very strongly. If I had known about it beforehand, 
it wouldn't have affected me in the least, because

05:01.382 --> 05:14.782
I knew exactly what I was interested in, and no 
rational argument would have dissuaded me, much

05:01.382 --> 05:14.782
less an irrational argument. So what was your 
doctoral dissertation? My doctoral

05:18.158 --> 05:29.397
dissertation was called Physical Studies of 
Planets, which was very broad to encompass a bunch

05:18.158 --> 05:29.397
of things. The main part of it by far was something 
called the Radiation Balance of Venus, which was

05:29.437 --> 05:40.977
an attempt to show that The high microwave 
brightness temperature of Venus, as found by

05:41.648 --> 05:57.852
Cornell Mayer and others, by ground-based radio 
telescopes, had as its most natural explanation a

05:41.648 --> 05:57.852
massive greenhouse effect. in which carbon 
dioxide and water vapor played the main role. And

06:02.098 --> 06:26.134
there were some subsidiary parts to it, one of 
which was work I had done partly with Stanley

06:02.098 --> 06:26.134
Miller on the radiation chemistry of a simulated 
Jovian atmosphere in which we, I think it's the

06:02.098 --> 06:26.134
first time anyone had done a laboratory study of a 
Jovian atmosphere, in which we made simple

06:02.098 --> 06:26.134
organic molecules almost all of which have now 
been discovered on Jupiter. Who was your thesis

06:29.901 --> 06:31.002
advisor? Kuiper. What was he like? That's a very 
complicated question. No, the question is very

06:36.352 --> 06:38.195
simple. It's a very complicated answer. For me, he 
was, as far as the science goes, tremendously

06:41.740 --> 07:00.128
stimulating, a source of information on 
absolutely everything from the Tisserand

06:41.740 --> 07:00.128
criterion in celestial mechanics to the 
lifestyles of lichens. He was the first person I

07:02.472 --> 07:06.077
ever saw given a fresh problem. to literally do a 
back of the envelope calculation. I mean,

07:10.327 --> 07:12.070
literally on the back of an envelope. And the power 
of knowing enough first principles physics to

07:12.871 --> 07:28.133
address a new problem just off the top of your head 
and see if proposed solutions came anywhere close

07:12.871 --> 07:28.133
was truly breathtaking to me. And this was before I 
had seen it in any of my physics classes. I saw it in

07:33.154 --> 07:34.957
Gerard's hands. And he was strongly supportive of 
my interests, as strange as some of them were. I was

07:45.293 --> 07:47.596
interested in extraterrestrial life, among 
other things. He was... temperamental. He had his

07:53.906 --> 08:06.608
quarrels with other scientists, but he was 
entirely supportive of me, including finding

07:53.906 --> 08:06.608
ways for me to supplement my income. And another 
thing which I very much appreciate is that he did

08:07.290 --> 08:15.484
not force a doctoral thesis on me. He let me 
generate my own topics, which I, especially in

08:15.903 --> 08:25.355
retrospect, very much appreciate.

08:27.157 --> 08:30.321
I want to skip now because we don't have very much 
time.

08:34.426 --> 08:37.089
Well, I remember when the journal Icarus first 
came out. It seemed to me it was full of mostly

08:38.531 --> 08:45.640
celestial mechanics from former East Block 
astronomers that I never heard of. And then you

08:46.379 --> 08:48.321
became editor in the early 60s. How did that 
happen? How did they talk you into it, or did you

08:52.466 --> 08:55.750
talk yourself into it? No, no, I didn't talk myself 
into it. I don't fully understand why Zdenek Kopal

08:59.054 --> 09:13.291
and A.G. Wilson decided not to be editors anymore 
or were asked by Academic Press not to be editors. I

09:13.351 --> 09:16.234
just don't know that information, and I never 
asked. But what I do know is I was asked to, they had

09:16.906 --> 09:24.353
asked me to be an associate editor from the 
beginning, and I was happy to do that. That was fun.

09:25.794 --> 09:28.036
And I published a few papers in there. Did not do 
anything in the way of editorial function. And

09:32.140 --> 09:37.245
then they came to me together and asked if I would be 
interested in replacing them as editor. I was

09:37.305 --> 09:40.608
really quite young and very flattered. It seemed 
to me to be a great thing to do, a wonderful way to

09:44.058 --> 09:59.559
find out what's happening in the field, and I had 
very definite ideas about how to improve the

09:44.058 --> 09:59.559
journal, one of which was to have referees, which, 
while not a novel idea in general, was novel for

09:44.058 --> 09:59.559
Icarus. And for some reason, which I don't know, I 
mean, I generally don't know, and it wasn't a thing

10:00.180 --> 10:08.932
that I felt comfortable asking, I don't know why 
they chose me. There was a feeling... a very strong

10:13.353 --> 10:26.048
feeling among the few people who were doing 
planetary astronomy at that time that the

10:13.353 --> 10:26.048
astrophysical journal just didn't want to 
publish any astronomy, and this held for radio

10:13.353 --> 10:26.048
astronomy, too, planetary. And it held for radio 
as well. My first publication was in the

10:27.650 --> 10:30.233
Proceedings of the IRE.

10:33.117 --> 10:35.039
So there was a definite need for Icarus. How did you 
go about getting the papers? Okay, let me say, I

10:39.625 --> 10:43.309
mean, I've heard this about APJ, but... My 
experience was that, I mean, I sent a bunch of

10:44.116 --> 11:12.891
papers to APJ in the 60s, and they were all refereed 
and accepted, and there was one wild paper that

10:44.116 --> 11:12.891
Russ Walker and I sent called On the Detectability 
of Dyson Civilizations, which was also

10:44.116 --> 11:12.891
published, so I never experienced that hostility 
at APJ, but others have mentioned it, and I can't

11:13.411 --> 11:15.173
make rhyme or reason of it. But as to how I solicited 
papers for Icarus, well, you know, there was a

11:16.095 --> 11:26.429
small number of people, and I said to them, look, 
we're doing well. We're concentrating on

11:26.449 --> 11:28.912
planetary science. Here is a journal in which you 
find only planetary science papers, not diluted

11:28.932 --> 11:38.005
by a vast array of papers on quite different 
subjects. And there are no paid charges, and We

11:41.710 --> 11:47.755
have glossy stock and that means we can print nice 
renditions of photographs. And some papers I

11:48.410 --> 11:50.133
solicited. I said to so-and-so, you know, you're 
the right person to review this subject. It needs a

11:55.863 --> 11:58.067
broad perspective. Why don't you do that for 
Icarus?

12:02.855 --> 12:04.478
But a lot of papers came unsolicited. And, you 
know, as soon as a few good papers were published,

12:04.879 --> 12:08.365
then other people noticed it. And it prospered. 
There's a sort of exponential built into it. What

12:13.739 --> 12:21.066
do you think the status of planetary astronomy is 
today among quote real unquote astronomers?

12:21.086 --> 12:26.952
Well, I think the degree of respectability has 
improved dramatically. Nevertheless, there is

12:27.773 --> 12:43.088
still the sense in many people's mind of 
respectability being directly proportional to

12:27.773 --> 12:43.088
distance or maybe to a high power of the distance of 
the astronomical object examined. And since the

12:43.456 --> 12:46.962
planets are nearby, they're considered 
disreputable. In part, this is... I think due to

12:48.839 --> 12:52.965
excesses by such people as Percival Lowell. But 
it's a kind of snooty attitude, which I think is

12:54.527 --> 13:01.358
best to simply avoid. I mean, just ignore. One 
thing I noticed is that when the government

13:03.941 --> 13:16.500
started spending large amounts of money on 
planetary science, especially sending

13:03.941 --> 13:16.500
spacecraft to the planets, the respectability of 
planetary science made a... dramatic increment.

13:20.045 --> 13:23.930
While you were editor of Vicarious, what fraction 
of your time did you spend on the journal? It wasn't

13:25.612 --> 13:26.533
vast. Maybe, I don't know, it's hard to estimate. 
If I give very broad limits, I would say between 10

13:31.360 --> 13:37.808
and 25 percent, something like that, and it varied 
from month to month and year to year. I should say

13:39.330 --> 13:41.593
that at a critical time, I had an the luck to have 
Steve Soder as assistant editor, and that really

13:42.046 --> 13:49.156
helped a lot. How did Icarus get to be the official 
journal of the Division for Planetary Sciences,

13:51.419 --> 13:57.448
the American Astronomical Society? Well, here 
was Icarus just being published by a commercial

13:57.468 --> 14:02.535
publisher, and here was DBS, which I had helped 
found, having no journal affiliated with it. And

14:09.545 --> 14:14.995
there were other institutions, professional 
societies that had their journals, lots of them.

14:15.015 --> 14:19.123
American Geophysical Union had Journal of 
Geophysical Research and so on. It was such a

14:19.458 --> 14:38.530
natural idea, and so I pushed it, and then there was 
a time when I was president of the DPS, and I had a

14:19.458 --> 14:38.530
chance to push it harder, and people saw the wisdom 
of it, and nobody was trying to force any editorial

14:19.458 --> 14:38.530
policy down people's... There's an appointed 
advisory board that has a lot to say about what

14:38.510 --> 14:44.936
happens. It was just an obvious marriage to be 
made, and I had the pleasure of being the marriage

14:45.977 --> 14:53.644
broker. What do you think is the current status and 
the outlook for the near future for planetary

14:55.485 --> 15:00.810
astronomy? Up, down, hanging in there. Planetary 
astronomy or planetary science? Both. Well...

15:07.872 --> 15:10.052
Um...

15:12.682 --> 15:15.306
You know, it depends very much on funding. And 
funding depends very much on Congress, and

15:16.407 --> 15:29.606
Congress depends very much on the health of the 
national economy and also the sense that

15:16.407 --> 15:29.606
taxpayers have about this being something worth 
spending money on. And all of these items are very

15:31.008 --> 15:35.254
hard to predict.

15:38.239 --> 15:39.921
The practical question is, If a bright, young, 
motivated scientist comes to me starting

15:39.901 --> 15:53.218
graduate school and says, I want to be a planetary 
scientist, would you recommend that I do it or not?

15:54.880 --> 15:57.283
I still, by and large, recommend that they do it. 
It's just the situation that all astronomy

15:58.204 --> 16:01.268
graduates do. Well, that's true. That's 
absolutely right, and certainly the number,

16:03.774 --> 16:13.791
absolute number of jobs available today is vastly 
more than it was in the 50s in any kind of astronomy.

16:14.452 --> 16:20.522
But still, if you thought the thing was headed 
towards some free-fall collapse, you wouldn't

16:14.452 --> 16:20.522
recommend that students pursue their interest 
there. I don't think we're in desperate straits,

16:25.168 --> 16:38.725
although it's very hard when you don't know about 
continuity of funding and all sorts of programs

16:25.168 --> 16:38.725
started and stopped seemingly whimsically. It's 
very tough, especially for the younger people. If

16:42.489 --> 16:50.239
you have tenure or you've been successful in 
research programs, you have some likelihood of

16:51.113 --> 17:19.399
continuity but young people don't and the thing 
i'm most worried about is not the older folks but

16:51.113 --> 17:19.399
uh... but the really young people there are more 
worried that we're we're not we're not preserving

16:51.113 --> 17:19.399
our options for the future uh... as we ought you 
think that uh... planetary scientists or and

16:51.113 --> 17:19.399
planetary astronomers have done a good job in 
selling themselves to the public and to the

16:51.113 --> 17:19.399
congress No and no. I think that planetary 
missions have done an excellent job of selling

17:24.010 --> 17:32.322
planetary science to the public and the Congress. 
Of course, in the context of the Cold War, many

17:33.083 --> 17:44.480
people understood each planetary mission 
triumph as another way that we beat the Russians.

17:45.522 --> 17:49.808
And that put a particular... skew to public 
appreciation. But despite that, I think

17:53.672 --> 18:01.243
understanding these missions for their own sake, 
for their true merit, did get through. Now

18:01.263 --> 18:07.932
that we have lots of improved visual techniques, 
including false color photography and

18:08.418 --> 18:25.617
virtual reality movies in which we dive down to a 
planetary surface, we have extraordinary tools

18:08.418 --> 18:25.617
to interest the public in what we do, which I still 
think we don't use adequately enough. And I think

18:31.828 --> 18:45.732
many scientists, if the funding dried up, would 
suddenly say, oh my goodness, I wish we had spent

18:31.828 --> 18:45.732
more time on popularizing what we do with the 
general public. What impact, if any, do you think

18:47.180 --> 18:58.774
the fact that we haven't found any traces of life 
anywhere else in the solar system, and in

18:47.180 --> 18:58.774
particular not on Mars, what effect, if any, do you 
think that's had on funding?

19:02.238 --> 19:06.042
I don't think it's had any perceptible effect on 
funding. If you look at the NASA expenditures for

19:06.122 --> 19:15.533
robotic missions, you see a big blip for Viking. 
But if you subtract, which I think is attributable

19:16.036 --> 19:23.907
to the interest in the search for life, but apart 
from that, it's reasonably flat. So I don't think

19:23.927 --> 19:27.192
there was a depression after Viking. We just 
returned to where we were in any case. And I think if

19:30.997 --> 19:45.537
NASA had had the courage to follow up Viking with 
further searches for life or life-oriented

19:30.997 --> 19:45.537
understanding of the past environment of Mars, 
they could have maintained the Viking blip. This

19:47.187 --> 19:49.010
is a different sort of a question. The former 
Soviet Union had a lot of people called

19:49.831 --> 19:56.662
astronomers and space scientists and all this, 
and they really didn't do much. Do you have an

19:58.465 --> 20:00.187
opinion as to why? Yeah, because they were living 
in the former Soviet Union. I mean, you know, you

20:03.492 --> 20:14.089
can criticize that some people didn't get a good 
education and there wasn't adequate peer review

20:03.492 --> 20:14.089
knowledge. especially with people who were 
politically connected. And Soviet scientists

20:17.582 --> 20:24.708
weren't willing to criticize each other in 
international forums for patriotic reasons and

20:17.582 --> 20:24.708
all of that. But the fundamental reason, I 
believe, is that the living conditions were

20:25.148 --> 20:30.153
impossibly hard. And I was continually amazed 
when we go over there to see the circumstances in

20:30.853 --> 20:41.443
which not just any astronomers, the best 
astronomers were living in. I remember seeing the

20:42.163 --> 20:44.025
little... alcove that Shklovsky and P. Kellner 
and Kaplan had to share at the...

20:58.683 --> 21:01.406
Sorry, I've forgotten the Astronomical 
Institute of the University of Moscow. It's named

21:03.128 --> 21:04.189
after somebody. Sternberg. The Sternberg 
Astronomical Institute. And that was very good

21:07.192 --> 21:11.397
conditions compared to living arrangements, 
standing in line for food and all of that. It is

21:16.643 --> 21:20.897
remarkable that anything was accomplished by 
Soviet astronomers. What do you think is the best

21:21.907 --> 21:25.553
piece of work you've done so far? I tend not to try to 
pick out bests and worsts.

21:32.986 --> 21:41.721
Maybe one thing that I'm pleased about is that my 
interest in the search for life elsewhere led me to

21:42.275 --> 21:47.101
all sorts of things completely unconnected with 
life. In trying to understand the habitability of

21:47.922 --> 21:57.973
Venus, I was drawn irresistibly to the conclusion 
that the surface was far too hot for life. And in

21:58.234 --> 22:03.540
trying to understand the seasonal changes on 
Mars, which had been widely attributed to the

22:03.520 --> 22:11.971
growth and seasonal decay of vegetation, I was led 
irresistibly to windblown dust. So I guess one

22:13.473 --> 22:26.470
thing I'm pleased about is that my interest in 
extraterrestrial life did not prevent me, in fact

22:13.473 --> 22:26.470
led me to a wide range of other subjects with quite 
different physics. Look at the difference

22:26.490 --> 22:27.992
between eolian transport and

22:27.972 --> 22:38.408
greenhouse radiative balance and search for 
life. They're quite different. But I've done a

22:39.570 --> 22:45.359
whole lot of things, and some of them I'm very 
pleased with, and others I wish I had done better

22:39.570 --> 22:45.359
on. I may have asked you this, but I'll ask again. Do 
you think planetary astronomy is part of

22:48.764 --> 22:50.687
astronomy? Sure. Sure. And... And you might say 
that spacecraft make it somewhat

22:55.225 --> 23:00.733
non-astronomical. If you can fly to orbit, land on 
a world, then why would you spend any time peering

23:00.813 --> 23:08.463
at it through a ground-based telescope? And to a 
large extent, that's true. But there are lots of

23:12.489 --> 23:16.795
worlds we can't fly to or can't fly to often. And we 
are shortly going, I think very likely, going to be

23:17.298 --> 23:26.389
examining planets around other stars that we 
surely are not going to be flying to shortly. And

23:27.190 --> 23:34.459
that means that ground-based and 
near-Earth-based planetary science is going to

23:27.190 --> 23:34.459
be with us for a very long time. And that kind of 
science is a part of astronomy. What's the role of

23:40.546 --> 23:47.254
NASA Money Bin in resurrecting what was 
essentially a dead field? Absolutely

23:47.588 --> 23:48.750
fundamental. NASA, as far as funding goes and 
other kinds of support, never mind space

23:48.810 --> 23:56.640
missions. Just on the ground-based end of things 
and the theoretical end of things and the

23:57.661 --> 24:08.275
laboratory simulation end of things has been 
absolutely essential in the renaissance of this

23:57.661 --> 24:08.275
field. And then if you add this astonishing 
capability that we now have to go to other planets

24:08.315 --> 24:15.925
and see what they're like, NASA's role is key, 
central, and historic for all the

24:16.394 --> 24:26.006
arteriosclerotic problems with NASA these days. 
What's your opinion of how NSA manages the

24:28.509 --> 24:31.793
planetary program? I mean, do they micromanage? 
Do they do about the right thing? Again, a personal

24:36.619 --> 24:39.162
view. There's so many aspects, and it's been so 
variable over the years, it's really hard to give a

24:40.238 --> 24:49.896
one-bit yes or no answer. I would say that given the 
existing funding constraints, NASA has not been

24:51.920 --> 25:04.002
orders of magnitude too generous or too 
impecunious. If you ask me whether it's made wrong

25:04.353 --> 25:22.492
decisions and failed to see something which was 
tremendously promising or spent lots of money on

25:04.353 --> 25:22.492
something which was a dead end or scientifically 
not very exciting, of course that's happened.

25:22.532 --> 25:24.795
It's happened a lot, perhaps too much. But 
overall, I think for all its flaws, NASA's done a

25:24.915 --> 25:33.364
fantastic job in the support of planetary 
science.
