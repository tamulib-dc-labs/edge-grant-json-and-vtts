WEBVTT

00:01.718 --> 00:03.982
The tape doesn't ring on this tape recorder. 
That's one of the things a rented recorder doesn't

00:04.002 --> 00:06.886
do. I guess you were talking about people speaking 
loudly or not speaking loudly. Some of us, that's

00:12.696 --> 00:19.126
just a question of where you are and what you're 
doing. I can get up on the bridge of a ship and be

00:19.627 --> 00:26.157
heard at a distance, and so if it's necessary, I can 
do it. It's like the people with whom I were

00:26.575 --> 00:29.245
associated with in the Army. I could certainly 
hear what all the officers said to me without any

00:29.365 --> 00:36.130
problem, best I could tell. You entered Berkeley 
in 37 in physics. Right. Okay. Did you have any

00:43.237 --> 00:47.223
design towards oceanography when you enrolled at 
Berkeley? Oh, I would say I didn't even know there

00:47.403 --> 00:51.129
was such a thing as oceanography at that stage in 
the game. I learned fairly quickly, though, that

00:51.489 --> 00:56.296
there was. I guess... Within the first couple of 
years, I ran onto some books in the physics

00:57.760 --> 01:03.008
department. I leaned towards physics, although 
that wasn't what I really started in at Berkeley,

01:03.328 --> 01:12.943
but nevertheless I got involved in the physics 
department at Berkeley fairly early on. They had a

01:13.304 --> 01:22.097
nice little library and there were some 
oceanographic books there, but I really didn't

01:13.304 --> 01:22.097
have any feeling that this was something in which 
one could make a living or anything of this kind. In

01:27.584 --> 01:35.712
fact, it really was only barely that as I found out 
soon.

01:35.732 --> 01:38.514
So I really didn't have any thought of that. I was 
interested in the ocean and I, as I mentioned, was

01:38.574 --> 01:50.025
involved with the Naval ROTC at Berkeley at that 
period. So I was interested in going to sea and

01:51.440 --> 02:02.572
working with the ocean, even though I was, in fact, 
really pushing toward

01:51.440 --> 02:02.572
a career as a physicist. So you participate almost 
at once in the Naval ROTC, but I notice you don't

02:02.592 --> 02:10.941
really enter the Navy until June of 41. Well, no, I 
was in Naval ROTC for the full four years at

02:11.001 --> 02:16.907
Berkeley, and I was commissioned As a result of 
that, I had a Navy commission when I graduated in

02:17.191 --> 02:34.305
May of 1941 from Berkeley, and things were kind of 
beginning to slip over the brink toward war at that

02:17.191 --> 02:34.305
point in the United States. practically 
everybody in my class in Naval ROTC was given

02:35.804 --> 02:46.944
orders to active duty within the first month or two 
after we graduated, even though the war hadn't,

02:35.804 --> 02:46.944
didn't start until December. But several of us, a 
bunch of us, went off to Navy submarine school in

02:46.964 --> 02:54.618
New London, Connecticut. And after that I went 
down I had the privilege of being the first Naval

02:59.682 --> 03:06.995
Reserve Officer to stand one in a submarine school 
class, and he went off to the Philippines to join

02:59.682 --> 03:06.995
the submarine. Late in 1941, and that's where I was 
in December of 1941,

03:08.497 --> 03:22.602
the United States got directly involved in the war 
situation. I spent practically the entire war

03:22.970 --> 03:29.940
period as an officer in submarines one way or 
another. I take it from such things as silver and

03:29.960 --> 03:39.054
bronze stars in World War II that you were, in 
effect, the line officer all during the war, not

03:29.960 --> 03:39.054
involved in any of the research like Revell and 
these people. No, I was not involved in

03:39.074 --> 03:41.297
oceanographic research. In fact, most of the 
people that I knew at that stage in the game who had

03:41.337 --> 03:48.808
not been in ROTC, my colleagues in ROTC, and the 
physics department had all gone off to places like

03:49.160 --> 03:55.088
Oak Ridge and Los Alamos. And so I really knew, by 
implication, more about what was going on there

03:55.108 --> 04:01.557
than I did about oceanography. I learned the hard 
way about underwater acoustics and things of that

04:01.577 --> 04:13.193
sort because we had sonar systems, very primitive 
ones, in the beginning on onboard submarines. I

04:13.848 --> 04:27.885
learned also about internal waves in the ocean and 
things like this just by the fact that periodic

04:13.848 --> 04:27.885
buoyancy changes in your submarine if you were 
operating close to the surface were things that

04:13.848 --> 04:27.885
you had to cope with. But I had no intention at that 
point of becoming an oceanographer per se.

04:38.137 --> 04:42.522
Late in the war, as things were winding down, I had 
the opportunity of going off to Harvard as part of a

04:43.885 --> 04:48.230
Navy postgraduate thing. And in fact, the war 
ended while I was at Harvard, or just as I went to

04:48.711 --> 04:53.736
Harvard. And so I had a choice of either staying in 
the Navy or finishing off that one-year graduate

04:54.958 --> 05:04.949
course still in the Navy and then going back to an 
active status. And I elected to finish the course.

05:09.113 --> 05:21.332
At that point I chose to go back to Berkeley, which I 
did in 1946, back to the physics department and to

05:09.113 --> 05:21.332
work toward a doctor's degree. So you worked 
really towards... I was involved in basic physics

05:24.097 --> 05:34.834
still at that point, and the group with which I 
became involved was in fact under Professor

05:36.772 --> 05:44.819
Emilio Segre, who eventually got the Nobel Prize, 
but not until after I left. And that was high energy

05:46.801 --> 05:51.245
nuclear physics. And of course, that's what that 
physics department was famous for. But it was also

05:54.647 --> 06:06.778
a very good department in that it was very strong on 
classical physics as well as in those days, as well

05:54.647 --> 06:06.778
as in high grade research in the nuclear side of the 
game. And when I finished my degree, I had been

06:07.147 --> 06:14.935
active in the, I had stayed active in the Submarine 
Naval Reserve. I was the commander of a naval

06:14.955 --> 06:23.685
reserve unit in the San Francisco Bay Area during 
that period. And so when I finished off my degree, I

06:23.705 --> 06:31.994
was kind of tempted to do something that would 
combine the nuclear physics and the submarine.

06:32.014 --> 06:33.255
And so I Most of the places that I visited in the 
inevitable job hunting period that comes right at

06:34.366 --> 06:52.671
the end of the degree, several of them anyway, were 
places that were involved in the then very new

06:34.366 --> 06:52.671
nuclear power business, which was solely tied up 
with some new sorts of things. And I wound up just

06:54.413 --> 07:08.265
because of this sort of coalition between the 
submarine interest and the physics interest. And

07:08.285 --> 07:20.615
while I was there, I hadn't been there even a year, 
and came out for a visit back to San Francisco area,

07:08.285 --> 07:20.615
which is where I was born. And at that point, I got a 
call from a friend of mine with whom I had worked as a

07:25.295 --> 07:28.521
graduate student. He was still a graduate 
student, just about to finish off. And he had been

07:32.929 --> 07:46.054
approached by Scripps to come down here and talk 
about a possible job in marine physics. This

07:47.114 --> 07:51.180
fellow had an army background. It happened that he 
knew one of the people who was helping to search for

07:51.200 --> 07:57.910
somebody to fill a vacancy. And so he told the 
people who were talking to him that I was around and

07:57.950 --> 08:11.210
that I was a physicist, but I was much more 
interested in the ocean than he was, and that they

07:57.950 --> 08:11.210
should ask me to come down. So they asked both of us 
to come.

08:16.223 --> 08:26.040
came on down and turned out that one of the members 
of the Marine Physical Laboratory was about to go

08:16.223 --> 08:26.040
off for a year. He had been running sort of a very 
nice program in underwater acoustics that was of

08:26.060 --> 08:36.878
considerable interest to the Navy and sponsored 
by the Office of Naval Research. And they wanted a

08:36.898 --> 08:40.965
physicist who could carry this on while he was 
away, and they were looking toward expanding the

08:41.671 --> 09:10.665
size of the laboratory somewhat anyway, so they 
were recruiting, and they made an offer to both

08:41.671 --> 09:10.665
Thompson, who was the other fellow with me, who 
eventually became an Atomic Energy

08:41.671 --> 09:10.665
Commissioner, and died tragically in an airplane 
crash while he was doing an inspection, site

08:41.671 --> 09:10.665
inspection thing over in Nevada. But anyway, they 
offered me a job and I really, the contrast with the

09:11.135 --> 09:40.770
Knowles Atomic Power Laboratory where there were 
a couple thousand people working on sort of

09:11.135 --> 09:40.770
building one very sophisticated engine and this 
sort of thing where I could come and have a little

09:11.135 --> 09:40.770
research group and see the whole program in my hand 
and control it and do something that was directly,

09:11.135 --> 09:40.770
that interacted directly with the ocean. It was at 
that point that I clearly made the move that I never

09:41.459 --> 09:49.948
regretted at all. It was a very good thing, just 
personally.

09:57.597 --> 10:05.425
So I came here and started doing underwater 
acoustics and sonar system sorts of things. This

10:07.531 --> 10:27.268
was again a good, it built well on my background 
because I could take the good classical physics

10:07.531 --> 10:27.268
that I had worked hard on at Berkeley and combine it 
with the submarineing that I had been doing

10:07.531 --> 10:27.268
because it turned out that a lot of us underwent 
acoustics at that stage in the game. In order to

10:27.288 --> 10:36.036
have quiet platforms from which to do acoustic 
measurements, we did a lot by working with the

10:27.288 --> 10:36.036
submarine force local in here. We would go out on 
the submarine and huddle and do some propagation

10:37.254 --> 10:44.283
tests and things of this kind. And so the fact that I 
could argue with a submarine commanding officer

10:44.303 --> 10:50.130
helped me a great deal in being able to make this 
sort of thing go. I have several questions I'd like

10:51.092 --> 10:53.795
to ask for 46 to 51. Did you do organized submarine 
research while you were attending Berkeley? You

10:58.814 --> 11:00.358
have an abbreviation there. It's Organized 
Submarine RES, which stands for Reserve. I ran a

11:04.930 --> 11:12.250
Navy Organized Submarine Reserve training unit 
in that area throughout that period. Helped to

11:19.509 --> 11:29.644
write the training programs and things like this 
because it was a completely new sort of

11:19.509 --> 11:29.644
enterprise. There had never been a submarine 
component to the Naval Reserve until after World

11:29.664 --> 11:32.728
War II. And so I did that in parallel with the work 
toward the PhD in nuclear physics. Okay, and your

11:40.036 --> 11:43.081
work in nuclear physics was really in what 
direction? What kind of research were you doing in

11:43.222 --> 11:45.866
Berkeley? I was working on, well the thesis had to 
do with, actually that's been a long time, I was

11:47.028 --> 11:58.909
working with the by then sort of intermediate 
energy cyclotron in the Crocker laboratory there

12:00.678 --> 12:20.475
that had a power range up to 23 muv and doing studies 
of heavy

12:00.678 --> 12:20.475
elements bombarding them with particles and 
looking to see what kinds of reactions would

12:20.962 --> 12:29.512
result, particularly things around aluminum and 
lead and this sort of business. There were some

12:29.532 --> 12:38.864
interesting

12:29.532 --> 12:38.864
short-half-lived alpha emitters that had not 
been studied. It was that sort of thing that

12:39.464 --> 12:43.289
unraveled a few odds and ends, and that became a 
thesis. Were you involved with the Atomic Energy

12:43.990 --> 12:46.493
Commission at this time? Only in that I held an 
Atomic Energy Commission fellowship for one of

12:51.607 --> 12:56.394
the years that I was working on the doctor's 
degree. Of course, at the North Atomic Power

12:56.414 --> 13:04.626
Laboratory, that was an organization that was in 
fact funded by the Atomic Energy Commission.

13:05.027 --> 13:14.160
Okay, now, when you become director of NPL, were 
you able then to guide the research activities of

13:05.027 --> 13:14.160
the lab? Well, directing a laboratory isn't I had 
built

13:16.278 --> 13:38.218
up my own research in underwater acoustics and 
marine geophysics and basically this

13:16.278 --> 13:38.218
laboratory, it's a small one, we had a handful of 
very talented people And the main function of the

13:38.705 --> 13:50.840
director was to see that the life went reasonably 
smoothly for them and to get out of their way at the

13:38.705 --> 13:50.840
right times.

13:50.860 --> 13:54.644
And at the same time, since it's a small 
laboratory, I was able to keep my own research

13:50.860 --> 13:54.644
going. And this has worked out pretty well over the 
long haul. I had been here at the laboratory about

14:01.933 --> 14:07.800
six years before I became director. We had had two 
previous directors who were both, I think, quite

14:08.810 --> 14:17.260
influential in

14:08.810 --> 14:17.260
my life. One of them was the man who basically 
recruited me to come here in the first place, Carl

14:17.280 --> 14:33.298
Eckhart, who was a distinguished physicist, who 
had become involved in the University of

14:17.280 --> 14:33.298
California Division for Research during World 
War II, and played a major role in that

14:17.280 --> 14:33.298
organization. And then he had been figure in 
theoretical matters and quantum mechanics and

14:38.662 --> 14:47.373
thermodynamics and things of this kind. When he 
came out here during the war he became quite

14:47.594 --> 15:06.458
interested in the ocean and in particular in a sort 
of missionary sense I guess because he was a very

14:47.594 --> 15:06.458
fine person in his ability to see how to apply 
high-grade mathematical methods to problems

14:47.594 --> 15:06.458
that other people hadn't yet applied them to. and 
he did this during the war in the sonar and

15:07.028 --> 15:36.175
acoustics business and when the war ended he 
decided he really didn't want to go back to the

15:07.028 --> 15:36.175
University of Chicago and so he convinced the navy 
that they should set up a laboratory within the

15:07.028 --> 15:36.175
University of California because he didn't 
really want to stay in the navy civil service

15:07.028 --> 15:36.175
laboratory situation which was what in fact the 
University of California Division of War

15:07.028 --> 15:36.175
Research at the end of the war, was kind of mostly 
turned into an organization called the Navy

15:36.492 --> 15:42.561
Electronics Laboratory. Descendants of that 
still exist here on the planet today. And at the

15:47.048 --> 15:56.402
same time, he arranged that the Marine Physical 
Laboratory should be established within the

15:47.048 --> 15:56.402
University of California. It was not really a part 
of Scripps' institution of oceanography. It was

16:00.228 --> 16:03.833
just an entity within the university with Eckhart 
as its director. part of the reason he was able to do

16:04.522 --> 16:34.461
this, and was encouraged to do it, was that one of 
the people with whom they were dealing in

16:04.522 --> 16:34.461
Washington, in the Navy Bureau of Ships, in the 
sonar design branch, was a commander named Roger

16:04.522 --> 16:34.461
Revell, who was on leave from Scripps, and so he was 
at the other end of this sort of thing, and within

16:04.522 --> 16:34.461
that framework, it had been decided

16:04.522 --> 16:34.461
they would go ahead and do this thing establishing 
a small laboratory that the Navy would fund, which

16:35.555 --> 16:57.597
would focus on problems in underwater acoustics 
and similar concepts, but which would be somewhat

16:35.555 --> 16:57.597
different from the in-house Navy laboratories 
which were then growing up, which would be rather

16:35.555 --> 16:57.597
more engineering oriented, but this would be more 
basic science oriented. And so that was basically

16:59.669 --> 17:04.355
the way this sort of thing started. Eckart, in 
1948, became director of scripts for a while.

17:10.423 --> 17:22.639
After a 20

17:10.423 --> 17:22.639
minute hiatus, Eckart did become director of 
scripts at that point.

17:24.695 --> 17:39.480
decided that there was no reason that there should 
be a small laboratory, the Marine Physical

17:24.695 --> 17:39.480
Laboratory in the San Diego area and the rather 
larger Scripps Institution, and so he decided to

17:41.215 --> 17:47.421
make the Marine Physical Laboratory de facto a 
division of the Scripps Institution. And the

17:47.941 --> 17:51.244
laboratory has maintained that position ever 
since. In fact, I guess it's the oldest existing

17:51.264 --> 17:56.989
administrative subdivision of the institution.

18:00.733 --> 18:06.298
And that explains how you could be director of MPL 
and also associate director of Scripps

18:00.733 --> 18:06.298
Institution of Oceanography? Well, that goes 
another way too in that

18:12.856 --> 18:26.348
Eckhart moved from being director of MPL to being, 
for a brief time, the director of Scripps because

18:12.856 --> 18:26.348
Sverdrup left in a fairly sudden manner. And so 
Eckhart kind of held the place together while they

18:26.568 --> 18:36.957
girded themselves up to recruit Roger Revelle to 
be the director of Scripps. And as you know,

18:37.898 --> 18:42.762
Revelle was the director for some considerable 
length of time. in 19, must have been late 61,

18:43.231 --> 19:06.316
something like that, Ravel,

18:43.231 --> 19:06.316
now this is a sort of trick situation, Ravel had 
been heavily involved in the development of the

18:43.231 --> 19:06.316
new campus here, the full-scale University of 
California campus. And in about 1961, they

19:13.640 --> 19:22.932
things had developed to the point at which they 
were going to appoint a chancellor for the campus

19:13.640 --> 19:22.932
and the decision was made not to appoint Ravel.

19:25.856 --> 19:42.938
He obviously was disappointed as were many of the 
rest of us who had worked with him because he had

19:25.856 --> 19:42.938
been sort of using Scripps or Scripps had used 
itself to help with the overall development of the

19:25.856 --> 19:42.938
campus and a lot of us felt we had a lot at stake and we 
were not really all that pleased when this

19:43.492 --> 19:50.587
happened, but nevertheless it did, and so it must 
have been the fall of 61. Roger

19:50.768 --> 20:04.116
decided that since the Chancellor had been 
appointed, Herb York, who was a perfectly good

19:50.768 --> 20:04.116
man, a very good man, Roger accepted a position as 
science advisor to the head of the Department of

20:04.484 --> 20:09.929
Interior, I guess it was. In fact, I think he was the 
first of the departmental science advisors. And

20:14.514 --> 20:16.436
so he went off to Washington. And what he left 
behind him was essentially a complex of three

20:17.497 --> 20:32.432
jobs, chief campus officer, the head of what was 
then the School of Science and Engineering, which

20:17.497 --> 20:32.432
was the beginning of the general campus here, and 
the directorship of the Scripps Institution. And

20:33.121 --> 20:42.573
I was asked, at that point, to take on the 
directorship of the Scripps Institution, which I

20:33.121 --> 20:42.573
did, much in the same vein as Eckhart, before me, 
had stepped from the Marine Physical Laboratory.

20:42.593 --> 20:55.450
And I'm not sure whether it's because my office is 
off the campus and all the other people at Scripps

20:42.593 --> 20:55.450
are on the campus, and maybe the Marine Physical 
Laboratory director, therefore, is thought to be

20:42.593 --> 20:55.450
a little more neutral and, therefore, more 
acceptable in this. context anyway. He,

20:58.020 --> 21:06.271
Roger left and I took over as the director for a 
period of close to two years. It was a particularly

21:07.833 --> 21:22.753
interesting thing if you're interested in 
coincidences and that sort of business in the

21:07.833 --> 21:22.753
history of science because the three of us who 
wound up taking the three parts of Ravel's job had

21:23.425 --> 21:28.271
all been graduate students together in the 
physics department at Berkeley simultaneously.

21:28.291 --> 21:29.973
Herb York and I were in the same research group. We 
both did our degrees for Segre. Keith Bruckner,

21:32.616 --> 21:47.154
who was a theoretical physicist who was head of the 
School of Science and Engineering at that point,

21:32.616 --> 21:47.154
he and I had been teaching assistants together in 
courses around 1950 at Berkeley. And we'd all

21:47.554 --> 21:49.737
three arrived by completely different I guess in a 
sense the only one who arrived really

21:50.155 --> 22:09.423
legitimately was Berkner because he stuck with 
the physics business and came to, eventually came

21:50.155 --> 22:09.423
to UCSD to head up the physics department and then 
took over as head of the school of science and

21:50.155 --> 22:09.423
engineering when Roger left. Herb York had gone 
the route of administration and so forth, having

22:13.696 --> 22:21.947
gone to ARPA and the Defense Research and 
Engineering Establishment in Washington before

22:13.696 --> 22:21.947
coming here. He, in fact, had been involved in 
things of that kind even at Berkeley when he was

22:22.888 --> 22:41.053
quite young, because he was,

22:22.888 --> 22:41.053
I can remember, he was sort of in charge of 
scheduling and things of this kind on the

22:22.888 --> 22:41.053
cyclotrons, while I was still a graduate student 
at Berkeley. probably right by the most

22:41.371 --> 22:57.997
illegitimate means, because I had, in fact, just 
plain abandoned physics, more or less, and

22:41.371 --> 22:57.997
although up till that point, I guess I still, we can 
talk about when did I become interested in

22:41.371 --> 22:57.997
oceanography or something like that. When the 
manpower questionnaires come by, you write in,

22:58.018 --> 23:04.628
they always want you to say whether you're a 
physicist or whatever, and I had been putting down

23:05.047 --> 23:10.273
physicist or geophysicist every year until I got 
to be director of Scripps. And I figured there was

23:10.293 --> 23:14.257
no way I could honorably do that anymore. So at that 
point I decided I was in oceanography. I'd been

23:18.542 --> 23:21.325
around Scripps for about nine years at that point. 
And I think that in much of oceanography this is the

23:23.347 --> 23:29.874
way, certainly in those years, this was the way it 
went. That people came in. usually on an

23:32.452 --> 23:35.015
opportunistic basis, which mine certainly was. I 
didn't come in because I went looking for a job in

23:35.035 --> 23:38.198
oceanography. The job came looking for me. Once I 
saw it, I didn't hesitate very long. But

23:42.642 --> 23:47.487
nevertheless, that's the way oceanography did 
develop in that sort of ten-year period. And I

23:47.648 --> 24:01.682
think that's one of the places where Ravel was very 
good, that he had tentacles out and could bring in

23:47.648 --> 24:01.682
interesting people to populate this growing 
institution that we had. do it in such a way that the

24:03.535 --> 24:23.350
people who would come mostly came initially with 
the idea that whatever the particular discipline

24:03.535 --> 24:23.350
was in which they were involved was probably 
capable of solving most of the problems of

24:03.535 --> 24:23.350
oceanography or something of this kind, or at 
least they weren't necessarily initially

24:03.535 --> 24:23.350
interdisciplinary people. By the time they'd 
been around for a few years, you began to interact

24:23.617 --> 24:36.503
with the other people in the group and eventually 
you got to where a lot of us are pretty strongly

24:23.617 --> 24:36.503
interdisciplinary oriented. We can work with 
people who have completely different

24:36.523 --> 24:43.718
philosophies about how to do one experiment, the 
last. A half dozen of my graduate students have

24:44.221 --> 24:51.655
been marine geologists, and they just don't think 
the way physicists do. But I've learned that there

24:51.675 --> 25:06.043
are many ways of thinking about science, and that 
geologists' ways are sometimes the right way to

24:51.675 --> 25:06.043
attack a problem, particularly if it's a problem 
in the real world as opposed to a laboratory-type

24:51.675 --> 25:06.043
problem. physicists have brought up with a sort of 
laboratory orientation. This is really not the

25:12.949 --> 25:18.345
only one that one should have if one is going to 
study the ocean.

25:24.164 --> 25:30.935
When you become associate director of Scripps 
Institution, what sort of... This was not... I was

25:32.898 --> 25:35.643
the director of Scripps Institution at that 
point. That was in 1961 to 1963. Then Ravel came

25:38.387 --> 25:45.199
back from Washington and took over again as 
director of Scripps. And I went back to being... I

25:47.418 --> 26:01.337
had retained the directorship of the Marine 
Physical Laboratory during this period, and I

25:47.418 --> 26:01.337
became also, at that point, moved over to being 
chairman of the Department of Oceanography, as

25:47.418 --> 26:01.337
well as the director of FDL. Revelle then left for 
good, about, when was that, 64 or 65, I mean, there

26:01.357 --> 26:11.350
someplace, He was back for the order of a year, year 
and a half. And then he went off to Harvard. And that

26:17.228 --> 26:19.110
was a permanent dissociation. And again, I took 
over the directorship of Scripps for about a year,

26:19.911 --> 26:27.699
during which time we made a search for a permanent 
director. And the end result was recruiting Bill

26:27.719 --> 26:33.826
Nirenberg to be the director. And he started in 
1965, I guess. And it was at that point that he asked

26:37.289 --> 26:41.033
me to be one of the associate directors. I guess 
partly just out of politeness or whatever,

26:41.738 --> 26:53.436
because I've been in the front office for so long, 
but in any event, this has continued. It's a kind of

26:54.237 --> 27:02.570
associate directorship that sometimes has lots 
of action associated with it and other times has

26:54.237 --> 27:02.570
none. It's kind of a special assistant type thing 
as opposed to some of the other associate

27:05.870 --> 27:12.698
directors of scripts who have specific spheres in 
which they act. Bob Fisher,

27:12.718 --> 27:23.170
for example, who is associate director for 
facilities, particularly for ships and that sort

27:12.718 --> 27:23.170
of thing. So that was pretty much

27:23.190 --> 27:29.637
how that sort of thing developed. I think that the 
institution certainly has

27:35.722 --> 27:38.546
hasn't changed all that much, I don't think. Some 
people would say it's changed

27:38.566 --> 27:57.049
a lot, I guess, but I think it's, in that it's grown, 
it's become a little more difficult to recognize

27:38.566 --> 27:57.049
explicitly the interdisciplinary things and the 
sort of oneness of the place. When I first came, we

27:57.069 --> 28:01.915
had Wednesday, lunches and everybody, a fair 
number of the members of the staff would come and

28:02.435 --> 28:16.515
bring their sack lunch and somebody would talk 
about whatever was interesting to them. That's

28:16.535 --> 28:18.237
the kind of thing that has gone away. I think this is 
in part due to the growth of the general campus

28:19.659 --> 28:26.569
itself as well as the growth of the institution.

29:11.403 --> 29:12.857
Testing, one, two, three, testing. Testing, one, 
two, three, testing. Testing, one, two, three,

29:14.169 --> 29:15.945
testing.
