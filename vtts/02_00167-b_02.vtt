WEBVTT

00:03.035 --> 00:05.618
What the guy from Oklahoma is Dean Kamm. Where does 
Hannigan fit into this? Well, Hannigan came while

00:08.761 --> 00:19.333
Earl Rutter was

00:08.761 --> 00:19.333
president. Now, I had moved up from my job to what 
they called the Director of Student Services.

00:29.724 --> 00:30.004
Yeah. Director of Student Affairs. No. Director 
of Civilian Student Affairs. And I moved the

00:37.967 --> 00:43.334
office to the Y, and I had, they called me, the rest 
of them called me the super counselor. And

00:45.216 --> 00:58.232
somewhere along in this time, Earl Rudder brought 
Jim Hannigan here, and I'm trying to come up with a

00:45.216 --> 00:58.232
year, because Earl died in, what, 60? No, he dies in 
70. He dies in 70. So Jim Hannigan came here, Mr.

01:04.966 --> 01:14.407
Rutter, the inauguration of Mr. Rutter is in early 
calendar 1960, but he had become president in 59.

01:14.467 --> 01:18.556
And the inauguration is the next year. And 
Hannigan gets... Rutter tells this story. that he

01:26.482 --> 01:34.732
went to the computer and asked to find the best 
qualified general for being the dean of students.

01:34.852 --> 01:38.096
Now, he wanted some military experience, but that 
was not it. That's how he found Hannigan. That's

01:39.238 --> 01:40.800
how Hannigan's name showed up. Now, there may have 
been some others, but he showed up. As you look back

01:44.084 --> 01:47.528
on it, how well did Hannigan understand A&M? Well, 
of course, when he first came here, now he was a

01:48.807 --> 01:58.738
graduate of West Point, graduated there in 1926, 
same year, 29, same year Benny Zinn graduated from

01:48.807 --> 01:58.738
A&M. He knew something about him, but it didn't 
take him long to learn it. And he took copious notes

02:06.426 --> 02:17.278
and hardly ever, ever lost his temper. with 
anybody. And he was named dean of students. Wasn't

02:24.934 --> 02:30.239
long after that, they hired another guy and they 
made him associate dean of students. And he didn't

02:30.319 --> 02:34.643
pan out, so they moved me into his associate dean of 
students. So you reported to Hannigan? I reported

02:36.484 --> 02:37.685
to Hannigan. We became very good friends. And he 
retired, I guess, in 73.

02:48.865 --> 02:52.269
Hannigan, do you have anything else on Hannigan? 
No, no, I'd love to. Hannigan, we knew he was going

02:53.671 --> 02:57.355
to retire. We wanted to find a replacement for him 
because we knew they were going to make it a vice

02:57.956 --> 03:04.324
president's office. And it had to be a Ph.D., which 
left me out, which I wouldn't mind. And we belonged

03:11.132 --> 03:17.860
to an outfit called SWASPA, the Southwestern 
Association of Student Personnel

03:11.132 --> 03:17.860
Administrators. And we went to the convention in 
Waco and I had known and Dean Hannigan had known

03:29.686 --> 03:33.350
John Colas for some time, and so we talked about 
him. Jim Hannigan and I talked about him on the way

03:34.351 --> 03:36.873
up there. So he said, well, see if he's interested. 
So I asked John, would you be interested in coming

03:41.217 --> 03:43.860
to A&M? He was at East Texas at the time. He said, you 
bet. So I told Hannigan, and Hannigan offered him a

03:48.224 --> 03:57.533
chance to come down and interview, and so he's the 
only one. I remember being one of the people that

03:57.935 --> 04:09.835
had lunch with John Colas when he came to visit and 
remember a nice pleasant impression that he made.

04:12.198 --> 04:16.065
Let's go back to the Rutter years though.

04:17.087 --> 04:22.255
How well did Mr. Rutter understand the students of 
the 60s?

04:24.952 --> 04:28.538
Well, I think you may understand he just couldn't 
tolerate it. He

04:30.421 --> 04:36.252
was not going to have any demonstrations on the 
campus. And the funny thing about it was that the

04:36.933 --> 04:49.795
civilian students would tell the cadets to stay 
out of it, we'll handle it, because if the cadets

04:36.933 --> 04:49.795
get into it, then you've got the media down. And, 
you know, he confronted these guys that wanted to

04:49.910 --> 04:56.138
march and everything and made them march around. 
And they were having a confrontation in front of

04:56.698 --> 05:00.143
Sully one time. And these civilian students told 
the Corps to go on back, well, about supper time.

05:06.410 --> 05:10.555
And there was an NBC television crew were filming 
this. And all they got is these civilian students

05:10.575 --> 05:15.081
telling these, what were they? The ragtag group, 
they had a name. and telling them off, and all of a

05:20.200 --> 05:27.009
sudden they hear the cadets marching to supper, 
and they're yelling as they enter the dining hall.

05:28.090 --> 05:30.613
While I'm coming there, there's a riot on the other 
end of the campus. Boy, they shut down those

05:30.794 --> 05:33.717
cameras, and they got down there. Of course, all 
these kids marching, but then that time the

05:34.899 --> 05:41.628
civilian students told these guys, right now, get 
off the campus. We don't want you here. Is that the

05:44.692 --> 05:48.857
worst demonstration you remember in the 60s? I 
don't remember any. Well, they were going to march

05:52.087 --> 06:02.557
front time, and I think it was, I don't remember 
what it was about, but they met them at the north

05:52.087 --> 06:02.557
gate and wouldn't let them on the campus. Civilian 
students made them walk down what's now a Welborn

06:02.678 --> 06:17.633
Road, and the police wouldn't let them walk on the 
road, so they had to walk in a ditch, and there was a

06:02.678 --> 06:17.633
little church down there in College Station over 
close to the railroad track that they were going to

06:02.678 --> 06:17.633
for a meeting. What was their cause? Do you 
remember? Well, I don't know. Of course, the

06:25.106 --> 06:27.569
Vietnam War wasn't going on then. Well, it may have 
been. When did the Vietnam War start, 61?

06:39.062 --> 06:40.343
Well, no. It may have been. You were at Fort Polk in 
61. Yeah, but that was— You're just trying to think

06:44.948 --> 06:49.033
about when it— I came back in 63, so it was sometime 
after 63. Stay with Mr. Rutter. What were his chief

06:56.077 --> 06:59.781
frustrations with student life? What did he worry 
most about? Well, he worried most about their

07:04.027 --> 07:07.952
appearances. He didn't worry too much about the 
cadets, but he worried about the civilian

07:09.614 --> 07:14.780
appearances. He also worried about the faculty 
appearances, too. He wanted the kids to get an

07:20.114 --> 07:22.476
education. Now, they brought a black in. He'd come 
out of prison, but he had been a war hero. And he came

07:30.984 --> 07:31.865
to A&M. They got him in A&M somehow. Earl Rudd 
accepted him, and he moved into one of the dorms I

07:34.628 --> 07:39.753
supervised then. And he was one that he would 
occasionally call one of the so-called

07:46.507 --> 07:50.232
counselors, and say, I'm coming out tonight. I 
want to tour the dormitories. And he'd go through,

07:51.774 --> 07:54.758
and he'd visit with them. Well, he wanted to visit 
this black man. He called me, and it was raining. So

08:00.306 --> 08:02.669
I alerted the dorm data that we were coming. When we 
get to this guy's room, there's no lights on except

08:03.390 --> 08:12.803
one little light in that room and a radio playing. 
That's what they call it, soul music then. And

08:15.683 --> 08:17.965
there were about four blacks in there. And 
everybody turned the lights on, and I turned them

08:19.206 --> 08:22.890
on for them. And he said, what's bothering you all? 
Well, they had all kinds of things. And he said,

08:29.376 --> 08:31.518
well, you're getting a good education.

08:34.040 --> 08:34.921
Well, yeah, they thought. He said, well, now this 
is just kind of like a filling station. We're

08:38.845 --> 08:41.707
brought here to get a good education. If you don't 
think you're getting it, I want to know. Other

08:45.232 --> 08:50.741
stuff you can talk to somebody else about, but I 
want to know if you're not getting an education.

08:50.761 --> 08:52.544
But he made the dormitories pretty regular. Do you 
remember any student efforts to play any pranks or

08:52.704 --> 09:00.657
march on Mr. Rutter's house? I don't remember him 
trying to march on his house, but he had a bulldog

09:02.981 --> 09:08.269
called Ranger and If somebody wanted him to get a 
message, they'd paint that poor dog up, and that

09:09.008 --> 09:15.177
dog would go home to eat, of course. And that's the 
way they got the messages to him. But the only march

09:19.925 --> 09:25.613
that I remember where they marched on the 
president's home was when Jack Williams was

09:19.925 --> 09:25.613
president. Were you, by chance, near the campus or 
on campus when Mr. Rutter's house burned, the

09:27.276 --> 09:37.952
president's house, over across from Sbisa?

09:43.197 --> 09:44.980
I don't think so. I've heard stories about it, but I 
don't remember when that house burned.

09:50.888 --> 09:54.113
It was late on a Saturday, I believe. Yeah. All 
right, let's see. Were you aware of Mr. Rutter's

09:57.518 --> 10:02.886
declining health before he goes to the hospital 
and dies? Well, to a large degree, yes. We knew that

10:06.251 --> 10:12.360
he left when he got nervous. he'd eat, and he was on a 
mashed potato circuit at a lot of places, and he

10:13.032 --> 10:24.597
would get so overweight that he'd go to Houston to a 
hospital down there to lose weight. Now, that's

10:25.720 --> 10:31.733
about as much as I knew about his medical history. 
So when he passed away, of course he was in the

10:33.704 --> 10:40.511
hospital when he died, but we were all very 
surprised by it. All right, let's see. Evaluate

10:43.153 --> 10:49.500
Rutter as a president from the student life 
aspect. Well, from the student life aspect, he was

10:51.281 --> 10:55.746
a good president. A lot of the kids didn't like him, 
but they respected him because he made them you

11:02.965 --> 11:04.187
know, get a haircut. If they didn't get a haircut, 
well, he was after them. And beards were out. And

11:10.134 --> 11:12.657
they had to keep their dress proper. I mean, when I 
say proper, they didn't have to wear a coat and tie

11:12.777 --> 11:19.626
or even a tie, but they better not walk around 
barefooted, you know. And we wouldn't let them in

11:20.326 --> 11:22.369
our office if they were barefooted. But I think he 
was pretty well liked. I know a lot of the faculty

11:25.513 --> 11:30.559
really didn't like him, but I don't know whether it 
was fear or what, but they respected him, you know.

11:35.998 --> 11:38.202
You said barefoot student. If a student came to 
your office barefooted, what did you say to him? Go

11:42.830 --> 11:45.855
back to your room and put on your shoes and socks. 
What if he came with a beard? Go shave. What if a

11:50.363 --> 11:51.865
student said, I'm not going to shave? You can't 
talk to me. Did anybody ever try to? No, because

11:56.782 --> 12:00.107
they always had to come see me about something, 
see. Those guys did. What were the primary worries

12:01.329 --> 12:06.618
that you had to deal with from the students? Well, 
we were concerned about keeping the dorms where

12:07.499 --> 12:18.737
they could study, and that the dormitory was 
clean, and presumably no alcohol, because we...

12:19.173 --> 12:23.119
We didn't go into that in the civilian areas as much 
as we did in the Corps. And we were concerned that

12:24.141 --> 12:31.714
they stayed in school and that they took care of 
their personal debts. During your years in

12:31.734 --> 12:36.461
student life, did the use of alcohol on campus 
increase?

12:40.528 --> 12:41.450
I don't think so. We sponsored a lot of dances. And I 
can't remember them coming to the dances, you

12:44.435 --> 12:48.959
know, enumerated. Can you? Yeah, they did toward 
the last. They liked to have bands that came in with

12:51.822 --> 12:58.228
just the best songs, Sloppy Pants. The music was so 
loud and so terrible. But they were still dressed

13:00.951 --> 13:02.693
when they came in. Yeah, there toward the end, it 
was pretty much, you know, they did their rights.

13:10.380 --> 13:11.421
What about drugs? Were there drugs being used on 
the campus during those years? There may have

13:17.042 --> 13:21.927
been, but I didn't know about it. I've heard about 
something. I heard about some of them, smoking pot

13:24.910 --> 13:28.634
primarily.

13:31.477 --> 13:36.062
Now women are admitted during the 60s under Mr. 
Rutter. How did that change the task of a student

13:36.823 --> 13:41.728
counselor? Well, really very little because they 
didn't live on the campus the first time. And once

13:48.600 --> 13:53.605
they moved on the campus, I remember where the 
first dorm they moved in. Was it Hart Hall? Was that

13:55.087 --> 13:56.448
the first dorm they had? No, it's one right there at 
Northgate. Okay, that's Walton Hall, I guess. All

14:01.914 --> 14:04.337
right, then that leads us to a new president. When 
do you remember first encountering Jack

14:05.258 --> 14:08.742
Williams? What was your first impression? Well, 
first impression, you're not an Aggie. That's off

14:16.520 --> 14:18.965
the bat.

14:21.690 --> 14:23.793
But I began to like him, and I liked what he did. He 
was an educator, for one thing. Earl Rudder had

14:28.402 --> 14:34.733
laid the groundwork for the growth of A&M, but he 
kept it up.

14:36.316 --> 14:42.706
And then about not long after he was president was 
when streaking became a vogue. And we had some

14:43.047 --> 14:48.335
streakers on the campus and we caught them one 
night. And I say we caught them, the university

14:49.357 --> 14:58.071
campus security then took pictures of them and 
Well, the kids were so embarrassed. But anyway,

15:01.347 --> 15:07.533
they were going to be dismissed

15:01.347 --> 15:07.533
from A&M. And so some of the kids decided they were 
going to march on President Williams' home. And

15:15.641 --> 15:19.105
John Coldis had gone to a convention. And he had a 
dean of students, which was a guy by the name of

15:19.125 --> 15:25.611
Powell.

15:27.920 --> 15:37.712
So I heard, because I'm an associate vice 
president then, I had heard that these kids were

15:27.920 --> 15:37.712
coming out, because somebody came and said they 
were going to march on President Williams' house.

15:38.553 --> 15:42.237
So I alerted the University Police, and I hailed it 
and got down there. Well, there was a pretty good

15:42.938 --> 15:53.050
crowd, and they were yelling and they were 
screaming and straggling and all, and Jack

15:42.938 --> 15:53.050
Williams comes out and he said, I'm going to talk to 
Williams. Just stay in the house for a while. Don't

15:55.688 --> 15:57.030
say anything to them. Let me talk to them. He said, I 
want to talk to them. Well, they kind of shouted him

16:00.533 --> 16:02.054
down. And so he finally did go back in. And I finally 
convinced them they should leave. And the

16:06.959 --> 16:08.921
university police came up to them. They were 
writing names and everything else. And they knew

16:11.803 --> 16:16.087
the kids that they were protesting to get out of 
school were going. Their protest failed. And

16:19.570 --> 16:22.513
that's the only one I can recall where they Dr. 
Williams have a sense of humor? Yeah, it was a, it

16:26.365 --> 16:31.111
was a, you kind of had to look for it once in a while. I 
think the one famous one I can remember was when

16:31.191 --> 16:40.741
they said, you know what a hell of a Lou Koneck is, 
and he said, yeah, beat the hell out of Texas. And

16:41.362 --> 16:51.353
they give him a, another time they gave him the horn 
sitting there, and he said, yeah, that's a

16:41.362 --> 16:51.353
careless carpenter.

16:51.957 --> 16:54.319
What about his public speaking ability? He was 
pretty good. And then it's under him that John

16:59.764 --> 17:05.149
Coldis comes in. Does Coldis change student life 
focus at all? Well, the biggest change he made was

17:12.035 --> 17:19.922
that he wanted services in everything. Coldest 
was the vice president for student services. The

17:26.509 --> 17:30.253
business office was the business services 
office. Everything had a service in it. So that

17:33.176 --> 17:38.582
food service and all was under him, would be moved 
under him? No, food service did not. That stayed

17:42.226 --> 17:45.590
under the fiscal office. Oh, okay, all right. 
Well, eventually it went under him, though,

17:49.334 --> 17:51.377
didn't it? Who? Eventually, food services did go 
under. I don't remember food services ever coming

17:56.953 --> 18:02.124
under John. Describe Coltus as a man to work with 
and work for. He was very easy to work for. He just

18:08.779 --> 18:11.745
hated like the dickens to say no. And I'd always 
tell him, you know, sometimes you need to say no.

18:19.257 --> 18:23.165
And he said, I'm going to let you tell them no, which 
I did lots of times. And I told everybody, I said, I

18:23.185 --> 18:26.050
wear the black hat, John. But his door was always 
open to the students. He'd come to work about 6.30

18:31.098 --> 18:37.527
or so in the morning, and that's when he'd do his 
work, because at 8 o'clock he started. A student

18:38.048 --> 18:45.599
could make an appointment with Colas at just about 
any time, unless he was in a meeting or something.

18:45.619 --> 18:48.203
And he had an infallible memory for students' 
names. Oh, my God. He and his wife both. Doris and I

18:52.550 --> 18:59.620
used to marvel when we'd go to the convention, 
because on the way back, they would talk to one

18:52.550 --> 18:59.620
another, and they would we found out how they were 
doing this, they would remember something

18:59.920 --> 19:09.809
particular about that individual that they could 
associate with, and they would use their names

18:59.920 --> 19:09.809
constantly. And they'd file it away. Let's see. As 
I understand it, one of Dr. Williams' conditions

19:13.713 --> 19:28.527
for his accepting the presidency here was that the 
board authorize him to designate a dorm January of

19:29.080 --> 19:34.026
1971 to be used for women. So the female enrollment 
really goes upward. Did that make much change in

19:39.092 --> 19:42.717
y'all's duties? No. They had, well, I'll take that 
back. They had a dean of men, and they hired a woman

19:53.110 --> 19:58.176
who was a dean of women. Who was that? Toby Shriver. 
Shriver. But she got married. Was that her name

20:05.139 --> 20:06.220
before she? No, she got married several times. I 
don't remember. That was her name when she came.

20:09.624 --> 20:12.627
Anyway, Hannigan, I was under Hannigan, wasn't I? 
I was under Hannigan. I was before Colas that she

20:14.529 --> 20:16.812
came. So that worked out. And she had an assistant 
that worked for her. And they didn't have, they

20:22.718 --> 20:27.403
hired students They didn't have somebody to go in 
and take their students, women students did that.

20:34.590 --> 20:42.221
As you look back on these years when you were a key 
person in student life, of what are you most proud

20:34.590 --> 20:42.221
personally?

20:47.688 --> 20:50.792
Well, I'm proud of the fact that I think I did a good 
job and the students still, I see students all the

20:51.110 --> 21:19.615
time and they remember me when they come back and I

20:51.110 --> 21:19.615
kept a number of students in school that might not 
have been in school and I

20:51.110 --> 21:19.615
think I also kept, helped keep a hand on the 
discipline of the students. We had pretty strong

21:20.118 --> 21:29.410
discipline up until this, shortly before I 
retired, on how we handled the students.

21:32.754 --> 21:35.477
This is not under Colas, but it was under Hannigan. 
I can remember they, they would come over here and

21:35.677 --> 21:47.492
was going to protest, and I guess that was the 
Vietnam War, and they had a bunch of students over

21:35.677 --> 21:47.492
there, and they were haranguing the students, and 
O.L. Luther was a Texas Ranger, and Jim Hannigan

21:50.597 --> 21:56.266
said, I want those guys in my office. So he and 
Shorty Maddox, they've shouldered their way

21:56.286 --> 22:04.600
through the crowd, and I mean, they put their arm on 
this guy right there. He and his friend, they were

22:05.361 --> 22:15.117
students, and brought him into Hannigan's 
office, and he said, you're out of school right

22:05.361 --> 22:15.117
now. pack your stuff and leave because you're no 
longer enrolled at Texas A&M University. That was

22:20.108 --> 22:22.672
about six o'clock in the evening. I

22:24.034 --> 22:32.565
can remember, well I think I helped a lot on the 
discipline on the things. I think I helped a lot of

22:34.047 --> 22:37.231
students.

22:39.934 --> 22:43.399
Do you remember any student problems relating to 
race? Race. Race or ethnicity?

22:50.507 --> 23:03.164
There was a couple of, on race, we had a few blacks, 
and they came to see, this was when I was director of

22:50.507 --> 23:03.164
civilian student activities. They came to see me, 
about four of them one time, and they wanted to

23:03.184 --> 23:12.357
know, they wanted to complain about them, that 
they weren't being treated right, and they said,

23:13.045 --> 23:19.595
One of the things they said was, you don't 
understand what it's like to be black. And I said, I

23:19.615 --> 23:20.937
understand that. But one thing you don't 
understand is to be a white when some of this stuff

23:21.578 --> 23:26.205
is being forced on you. You want something to 
happen to your family or something might happen to

23:28.168 --> 23:32.174
you? I said, don't threaten me. That was the end of 
that conversation. That's the only thing. They

23:37.104 --> 23:41.330
complained about something, but I never heard the 
students complain about it. But right after that,

23:41.510 --> 23:45.176
you got a call from campus police. They were 
burning books over at the library. Yeah. But there

23:48.580 --> 23:53.347
were no, by and large, there had been no dormitory 
incidents. Not that I know of. Of black and white.

23:57.433 --> 23:58.094
Not contrary. They lived in there, you know, in the 
civilian dorms. That was on the rudder. All right,

24:04.835 --> 24:06.237
I'm almost through. What have we not talked about? 
What are the omissions? What have we not talked

24:09.181 --> 24:13.288
about that we should have regarding? Well, I think 
this was during part of the time when Dolores was

24:13.468 --> 24:20.038
working out there and I was with the guard. Tell me 
about the office where you'd have, and I was in

24:20.658 --> 24:26.728
office, stayed open 24 hours a day. And she worked 
on a weekend, on some weekends, and she was out

24:27.869 --> 24:33.137
there all day, Saturday and Sunday.

24:36.509 --> 24:37.631
They just did everything. I felt like we never had 
any time off because we had to learn telegraphy

24:38.612 --> 24:50.832
because they closed down over at the MSC, you know, 
during the holidays. Western Union closed down.

24:53.556 --> 25:03.833
But anyway, it was... And running messengers with 
telephone messages to come to the phone or call

24:53.556 --> 25:03.833
their parents or call a prof. We went on a cruise. 
Last year, and there happened to be one of the boys

25:04.201 --> 25:15.755
that needed a job so badly, and he was one of my 
messengers, and he really climbed up to be an

25:04.201 --> 25:15.755
executive of a big oil company. He was on this 
cruise. When he saw me, he said, you know, he said,

25:19.180 --> 25:30.053
when I started working with you, he said, I thought 
you were going to be so easy. He said, the first day I

25:30.554 --> 25:33.718
came to work, he said, it was pouring down rain. and 
you had a lot of messages a lot of telephone calls

25:34.981 --> 25:59.959
you said to me bill you better get ready to deliver 
these and then he said miss perry it's raining and

25:34.981 --> 25:59.959
she does you knew when you were hired that you were 
going to have to work and do this there's a slicker

25:34.981 --> 25:59.959
and there's the bicycle so deliver it and when we 
got off the ship he hollered down said Miss Berry,

26:00.175 --> 26:02.358
do you have any more messages? But when the dorms 
were so crowded and we were having so much trouble

26:03.379 --> 26:11.330
placing all these students coming in and we had a 
three and four-door room. And I always worried

26:12.932 --> 26:19.841
about so many times the students would forget to 
turn in their registration card. And I had a call

26:21.884 --> 26:28.933
from the registrar's office and I couldn't find 
a... I had on my roster the name Chanel. But I

26:35.604 --> 26:40.549
couldn't find any registration or anything, so I 
finally called the first sergeant in. And I got

26:41.870 --> 26:44.053
along with the students very well. And he said, 
Miss Perry, he said, you know, we have a pet skunk in

26:44.793 --> 26:51.060
that room that's got little ones. And I said, well, 
you get rid of it. That was Chanel. That was Chanel.

26:56.045 --> 26:57.587
Had a room to herself. and there were a lot of sad 
times with the students. You don't remember

27:05.445 --> 27:11.794
students, you don't think of them really being 
poor at that time. But there really were some that

27:12.375 --> 27:16.060
really just didn't have any money. And I wasn't 
supposed to, but I did let them reserve their

27:16.140 --> 27:24.412
rooms, and I kept a lot of it up in my head. I couldn't 
afford to take sick a lot of time during that time.

27:27.875 --> 27:31.598
But anyway, the students, I can't say enough good 
things about them. I think A&M was blessed with

27:31.718 --> 27:39.145
having very moral students. I really don't think 
you have that as much today as we had it back then.

27:49.153 --> 27:51.295
But they were really, really outstanding. And I 
was always proud that Perry had a degree from A&M. I

27:55.959 --> 27:57.240
was just sorry that I wasn't able to get one, too, 
because when we lived in College View, if I could

27:58.013 --> 28:07.627
have just gotten my last year, it would have been 
fine, but it would have been great. But we needed to

28:08.308 --> 28:13.576
get him out of school, so that was worth the 
sacrifice. As she said, the students, they're my

28:13.596 --> 28:27.396
fondest memory of A&M, and they always were, and 
they always always pretty upbeat, really. And as

28:29.969 --> 28:39.799
the years went on, it began to change, and I guess 
the change started somewhere in 75, where it began

28:29.969 --> 28:39.799
to get worse. And when I say worse, I mean the 
students and everything began to kind of come

28:40.639 --> 28:45.724
apart. I guess the 60s influenced on it. Well, it 
didn't come apart, but The closeness, the

28:54.933 --> 28:59.263
cohesiveness of the student body began to change. 
You retire in what year? 88.

29:07.040 --> 29:09.145
As you look back on those years, What did it mean to 
you that you came to Texas A&M, to school? Well, it

29:14.913 --> 29:21.202
means a whole hell of a lot, because I don't know, I 
wouldn't be where I am today. If I had gone and went

29:21.342 --> 29:28.592
on back to Oklahoma A&M, now Oklahoma State, I 
don't know what I would have done. Perry's people,

29:31.276 --> 29:33.900
Perry's father, he was He was talking to you about 
his father. That wasn't his father. That was his

29:38.359 --> 29:39.740
mother. His mother married. But his father was a 
surgeon. And all of the Perrys were in the medical

29:44.225 --> 29:46.707
field. His aunt worked with Dr. Banning and Best to 
make insulin. And they always thought Perry would

29:51.432 --> 29:55.396
go over to medical school. But when he went to A&M, 
they just felt like disowning him because he was

29:57.077 --> 30:03.043
not going to do this. But anyway, later on, as they 
came to visit us, they realized we hadn't gone to

30:03.614 --> 30:12.444
hell in a handbasket and everything was okay. If 
somebody gave you today, this is the next last

30:13.745 --> 30:28.361
question, if somebody gave you today a check for a 
million dollars with only one condition on it, you

30:13.745 --> 30:28.361
must give it to Texas A&M, but you can decide what 
the money is going to be used for. What would you

30:29.202 --> 30:30.904
tell them to use it for? Most of it I would want to put 
in the scholarships. Awarded on what basis? on

30:44.097 --> 30:51.269
need, I think, not just their scholastic ability. 
You know, with that much money, I might endow one

30:51.910 --> 30:55.376
presidential scholar. And I put some into the, 
what is it, the fun for bricks and mortar that

30:56.277 --> 31:03.910
they're talking about. Okay, last question. What 
feelings do you hold in your heart now for Texas

31:06.475 --> 31:09.440
A&M? I love it. I'm enjoying retirement, and I tell 
everybody when it stopped being fun, that's when I

31:11.806 --> 31:18.935
decided I'd retire.

31:21.618 --> 31:22.840
Some people said, do you miss it? And I said, you 
know, really, I'm still fortunate that I belong to

31:23.581 --> 31:30.629
a committee out there, ex-officio. But I said, I 
don't have time to work anymore. I've got other

31:33.773 --> 31:35.355
things going on. But I don't, I miss the 
association with the students.
