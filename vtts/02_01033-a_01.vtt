00:09.785 --> 00:12.928
Okay, what's your name and when were you born, sir? 
My name is Martin Wiginton. I was born here in

00:15.371 --> 00:20.437
Austin, Texas, February 4th, 1933, which makes me 
52 now. I'll give you a brief rundown on the early

00:22.419 --> 00:30.688
years of my life when I was more in the mainstream of 
society. Went through high school, graduated in

00:32.030 --> 00:39.538
1950 from Austin High, which at that point in time 
was the only white high school in austin there was

00:40.261 --> 01:09.238
one black high school that austin high was one of 
the largest high schools in the country we

00:40.261 --> 01:09.238
graduated 1200 people the year i graduated i think 
during that period for nine years of my life the

00:40.261 --> 01:09.238
major thing was i was a jockstrap i played baseball 
and basketball and in high school at the

00:40.261 --> 01:09.238
university of texas i played baseball and then 
semi-pro baseball played in the army i spent Two

01:09.995 --> 01:19.609
years in the Army in the Panama Canal Zone, 1954 to 
1956 approximately, all I did there was play

01:09.995 --> 01:19.609
basketball and baseball. I had a jock-crazy 
post-commandant, and he had a bunch of athletes

01:19.649 --> 01:29.123
who were privileged characters. In fact, I had to 
blackmail him after nine months. They still

01:32.027 --> 01:33.649
hadn't given me a job. All I did was play sports, and 
I finally told him I wasn't going to play for him

01:34.230 --> 01:39.057
anymore if he didn't give me some kind of job 
because I didn't come into the military, didn't

01:39.712 --> 01:48.363
let them draft me to play sports. I could have done 
that without being in the Army. At any rate, he gave

01:51.027 --> 01:58.676
me a job, and I

01:51.027 --> 01:58.676
spent that time in the Army. While I was down there, 
I also played professional Winter League

01:58.717 --> 02:04.504
baseball, which was AA, AAA. some major leaguers 
playing in it. He made it possible for me to do that,

02:06.952 --> 02:14.982
which I think is probably illegal to be in the Army 
and be playing professional baseball, but we did

02:06.952 --> 02:14.982
it. In undergraduate school in 1950-54 at the 
University of Texas, I studied a variety of

02:16.965 --> 02:23.052
things. Philosophy was my major for a while, ended 
up to be a minor. resources, which is a certain

02:27.637 --> 02:36.367
category of economics, and it depends on how you 
define disciplines, but you study resources. I

02:37.348 --> 02:46.959
ended up getting my major in economics, which at 
that time is much different from the economics you

02:37.348 --> 02:46.959
have now, which is more statistical and computer 
stuff. Ours was theory and how do you motivate

02:47.079 --> 02:56.209
people or how do you answer some big questions 
rather than how do you play with math. Let's

02:57.117 --> 03:08.407
see, the middle 50s, 56 down in Panama, came back, 
knew I was going to law school. It was the Korean War

03:09.047 --> 03:11.369
period, 54.

03:14.492 --> 03:26.702
And what I did, I knew I wanted to go to law school, I 
knew that the GI Bill rights were gonna run out, and

03:14.492 --> 03:26.702
I knew I was gonna need the GI Bill to go to law 
school, so I requested that I be drafted so that I

03:27.256 --> 03:30.741
would earn those educational benefits. And I did 
get them. So when I came back out of the Army, I

03:32.984 --> 03:38.071
entered UT Law School.

03:42.437 --> 03:45.020
I had entered UT Law School before I went into the 
Army. Then I dropped out of law school, went to the

03:45.040 --> 03:49.146
Army, came back, and then I had the GI Bill. And I was 
courting the woman who was to become my wife. She

03:52.550 --> 03:56.115
was a resident of Lubbock, Texas. and going to 
Texas Tech. Spent about a year

03:58.292 --> 04:05.061
courting her, going back and forth between there 
and here. We got married, I guess, about 57. Of

04:12.831 --> 04:16.075
course, that year of courting didn't do me any good 
in the Oscars. I dropped out that year. But after we

04:18.458 --> 04:23.865
got married, and Cheryl, my wife, graduated from 
Texas Tech. She was a schoolteacher. We came to

04:26.605 --> 04:27.887
Austin. She taught school while I went to law 
school. And at that point in time, I guess I

04:32.232 --> 04:41.283
actually made more money, relatively speaking, 
or we did, than ever since. We lived in veterans'

04:41.463 --> 04:46.829
apartments, which cost $25 a month, all bills 
paid. And I had the GI Bill, which was about $150,

04:48.111 --> 04:52.596
$200 a month, which You'd have to multiply by four 
or five men to get the comparable value. She got

04:58.692 --> 05:02.978
teachers' pay, and I worked full-time. My 
brother-in-law and sister had a drive-in

05:04.100 --> 05:09.828
restaurant, and I was a manager, assistant 
manager there. I didn't go to class as much. UT Law

05:11.931 --> 05:17.760
School at that time did not require, most of the 
professors did not require attendance. One of

05:17.780 --> 05:18.301
them did. You had to be there. And I was good at 
taking tests, good at studying, good at reading

05:20.251 --> 05:25.699
and cramming, and I did a lot of that. And graduated 
from UT Law School in 1960. All during this period,

05:33.731 --> 05:42.264
I was pretty, what I now think of,

05:33.731 --> 05:42.264
pretty damn naive and apolitical.

05:44.727 --> 05:47.271
While I was in the Army, I had an experience that 
that radicalized me to some extent made me madder

05:47.453 --> 05:54.123
than hell, which is generally one of the ways 
people become radicalized.

05:56.888 --> 05:59.652
Eisenhower, a guy named Dwight D. Eisenhower was 
president. He was coming down to Panama. Big

06:01.535 --> 06:10.890
hoopla deal, you know, and I was on the Caribbean 
Command headquarters post, which is the top thing

06:01.535 --> 06:10.890
south of the United States. He would be there, he 
and Mamie. And I'll be goddamned if the officer's

06:15.989 --> 06:21.017
club and the women's room, they didn't have, it 
wasn't air conditioned. And they were afraid that

06:21.037 --> 06:28.268
Mamie might have to go in there and piss, and they 
spent $6,000 to air condition that women's room.

06:28.288 --> 06:31.152
And I didn't like that the least little bit there. I 
was not making hardly any money at all, and they

06:31.172 --> 06:37.562
were worried about her bathroom. The other thing 
that happened when he came down there that really

06:37.742 --> 06:44.292
packed me, they had honor guards when they brought 
in all these heads of state, dictators, and

06:44.845 --> 06:52.475
mostly, I guess, nine, ten-something were 
dictators. Some of them might have been

06:52.495 --> 06:59.424
Democratic elected, but I don't think so, because 
there weren't many in South and Central America at

06:52.495 --> 06:59.424
that time. And they'd come in, and we had honor 
guards, and you had to go out there and stand, and

07:00.145 --> 07:07.815
they'd play the national anthem of the country 
involved, and then they'd play ours. And you had to

07:09.010 --> 07:10.572
stand at attention. You know, you're sweating. It 
was real bullshit anyway. And the bands were

07:13.715 --> 07:14.977
playing. And those planes would fly in. And 
invariably, there would be about three planes.

07:21.904 --> 07:24.807
The first plane would be the dictator and his 
official party. And the second plane would be the

07:25.488 --> 07:29.853
mistresses and the party girls. And the third 
plane would be the booze and all the gifts and

07:30.494 --> 07:37.161
payola. And then we had to cart that shit. Well, the 
way I was raised, it went against my grain for me as a

07:41.535 --> 07:51.204
human being, an individual, to have to carry the 
luggage of some fucking dictator. I mean, I don't

07:51.425 --> 07:54.828
dig that shit. You can carry your own, but I didn't 
do anything. I carried the luggage and went on

07:58.471 --> 08:00.493
about it. But I know it made a big impression on me, 
and I didn't like it. Well, back to the

08:07.853 --> 08:21.650
latter part of the 50s, I had several good friends 
in law school that got to know real well. They're

08:22.932 --> 08:27.637
very good lawyers now around the state with big law 
firms who were very close. But it was during that

08:28.739 --> 08:36.949
time that I began to, I think it was, it's hard to pin 
things down, but I think it was during that time

08:28.739 --> 08:36.949
that I began to get more liberal or progressive in 
my views. I knew that all the shit that was coming

08:41.140 --> 08:51.449
down about racism and black people was a cut and 
dried issue. I mean, and yet you were hearing a lot

08:51.469 --> 09:01.078
of bullshit about you gotta keep up traditions and 
they're better off this way than any other way and

08:51.469 --> 09:01.078
blah blah. And at any rate, I graduated from law 
school in 1960s. My friends went other ways, some

09:08.637 --> 09:15.346
of them practicing law in Houston, some in 
Amarillo, and some in Dallas. My wife and I had

09:17.429 --> 09:23.478
quite purposely not had any children while we were 
in law school. But after we settled down to

09:25.220 --> 09:37.497
practice law in El Campo, a little town down on the 
Gulf Coast between Houston and Victoria,

09:25.220 --> 09:37.497
she taught school there and I practiced law. El 
Campo's in Horton County. It's an area that's very

09:40.532 --> 09:48.171
rich in resources and agriculture and minerals. 
Outside of the urban counties in Texas, it's one

09:48.932 --> 09:52.902
of, I think it is, the richest. It's got about 14 to 
16 different national origins of people that live

09:54.706 --> 10:01.094
in Horton County. Every year their county fair 
type thing is an all nations festival where the

10:01.114 --> 10:06.801
people dress up. They still do this. They dress up 
in their costumes and have the food and the music

10:07.742 --> 10:11.887
and all of that. But I had kinfolks there. That's 
where my daddy's family had homesteaded back in

10:14.330 --> 10:20.998
the 1890s. And My kinfolks were rice farmers and 
cattle ranchers. They'd been poor as hell during

10:26.220 --> 10:30.506
the Depression, the 1930 period. I think one of 
them had everything sold out from Hungary. But the

10:37.175 --> 10:40.660
World War II, they got quite wealthy. They were 
good farmers. It was much easier to get credit and

10:44.425 --> 10:49.132
get the equipment to do the rice farming and the 
cattle ranching. And those two efforts go

10:50.377 --> 11:06.704
together, I don't know if you're familiar with it 
or not, but generally speaking they grow rice on

10:50.377 --> 11:06.704
land one year and then they let it lay out for a year 
or two and that year or two it's laying out is when

10:50.377 --> 11:06.704
they graze cattle on it and it helps the cattle and 
the cattle fertilize the land and it helps rebuild

10:50.377 --> 11:06.704
the land. It's a pretty good system. At any rate, 
they were there and they helped me set up a lawn

11:08.306 --> 11:16.620
practice and we My wife became pregnant, and we had 
our first daughter within a year from the time we

11:17.427 --> 11:27.944
moved there. At this point, let me say that I have 
three daughters. Cheryl, her name is Cheryl

11:35.216 --> 11:38.101
Lemon. She was from Lubbock. Cheryl and I lived 
together for seven and a half years. She had all

11:45.220 --> 11:54.128
three girls by cesarean section, which means they 
have to cut the woman open to get the baby out

11:45.220 --> 11:54.128
because of delivery problems. We were together 
during the three years of law school, then several

11:56.010 --> 12:03.597
years in El Campo, and then a couple of years after 
we moved back to Austin. And then we broke up and

12:04.017 --> 12:10.483
divorced, and she moved back to Lubbock and 
remarried. Had twin boys then by cesarean

12:10.783 --> 12:13.406
section. At any rate, I have three daughters. 
They're great girls, great women now. All of them,

12:17.835 --> 12:26.548
two of them are graduates of Texas Tech and one of 
them's about halfway through studying art. The

12:26.568 --> 12:41.670
middle girl is in the Air Force now as an 
intelligence officer out in Denver reading, I

12:26.568 --> 12:41.670
think what she does is read satellite photographs 
and interpret them for fighter pilots, but I'm not

12:26.568 --> 12:41.670
sure.

12:44.603 --> 12:46.305
My ex-wife and I get along quite well. In addition 
to being naive about politics and social activism

12:47.107 --> 13:03.510
during the 1950s, during the 50s and 60s, it was all 
a big learning experience for me about sex and

12:47.107 --> 13:03.510
sexual relations and the way people ought to treat 
each other. And certainly I didn't treat my wife

13:03.570 --> 13:07.455
the way I should have. She was a very fine person. We 
had a lot of good times. I was very deceitful with

13:12.869 --> 13:37.375
her, and it took me a period of six or eight years 
probably to work out a lot of the problems that I

13:12.869 --> 13:37.375
think most men and women have, or at least of that 
generation and that time had of being able to

13:12.869 --> 13:37.375
communicate and handle each other's desires and 
needs.

13:39.245 --> 13:44.172
You just want to keep going chronologically 
through, kind of through my life, or do you want to

13:39.245 --> 13:44.172
get back to questions? That was good. I mean, I 
don't care. I'm getting ready to get into the

13:46.075 --> 13:48.358
radical part. Describe the hippie scene in Austin 
in the 60s.

13:59.375 --> 14:03.701
Let me first say that I have some problems with the 
term hippie. Okay, define the word hippie then. I

14:05.243 --> 14:05.784
mean, whatever. It is.

14:12.218 --> 14:30.242
It was used in a lot of derogatory ways by the media 
and by politicians and by public opinion,

14:12.218 --> 14:30.242
so-called public opinion makers, to put down a 
variety of things, some of which I thought were, at

14:12.218 --> 14:30.242
that time, pretty apolitical. I now have a broader 
view of what's political than I did then, but

14:30.362 --> 14:38.513
that whole so-called hippie scene, I think, had a 
profound impact on society. It changed me. I mean,

14:45.654 --> 14:47.176
I never was a hippie. I never considered myself a 
hippie.

14:51.802 --> 14:53.744
Because it made, they were more honest. Their idea 
was and is that people should be honest with each

14:53.984 --> 14:58.790
other. People should love one another. People 
should try to help one another.

15:04.818 --> 15:07.663
And most times in our society, people do not do 
those things. They are not honest, and they don't

15:08.143 --> 15:14.093
make conscious efforts to try to help one another 
or love one another. And

15:14.954 --> 15:24.189
I guess one of the general definitions would be 
that the hippies used a lot of dope. And if you're

15:25.531 --> 15:30.960
going to fool with that kind of term, I guess you 
could say that Yeah, hippies did introduce to this

15:31.582 --> 15:41.434
society the idea that different drugs have a lot to 
offer people. And in my experience, that proved

15:41.454 --> 15:45.779
correct. I say my experience, I don't mean me 
personally, because the only drugs that I've

15:48.182 --> 15:55.511
experienced are marijuana two or three times. But 
it has an effect on me that I don't particularly

15:56.492 --> 16:00.897
like. It makes me where I can't talk. And I'm a 
verbal person, and if I'm having a lot of thoughts

16:04.716 --> 16:16.269
and a lot of good things to feel and say and not be 
able to say them, then I don't like it. Also, back

16:17.090 --> 16:27.002
during the early 50s, as was fairly common then, I 
used speed one time when I'd been up for 48 hours or

16:17.090 --> 16:27.002
two or three days studying. And hashish, I 
experienced that one time during the 60s, but only

16:27.826 --> 16:36.034
once. And all that is concentrated marijuana. I 
mean, it's very heavy. It really cools you out.

16:49.467 --> 16:56.314
What I remember about the marijuana and hashish 
experience is it makes you much more sensitive to

16:49.467 --> 16:56.314
color and sound. and your own bodily feelings. But 
I didn't like the other effects enough where I

17:00.473 --> 17:05.260
didn't do it. Now, what I did do for 30 years, I drank 
hard. I boozed hard from the time I was in my senior

17:09.546 --> 17:14.674
prom in 1950.

17:16.460 --> 17:17.702
for 30 years. Lots of beer, lots of alcohol, vodka, 
gin, you name it. I've drunk it in great

17:21.728 --> 17:23.891
quantities. I quit about three and a half or four 
years ago and it got to be too much of a burden and too

17:23.911 --> 17:29.438
long of hangovers. So that was my drug, was 
alcohol. But to get back to the hippies, I think

17:32.863 --> 17:39.052
they had a profound, I know they had a profound 
influence on our whole society. They made working

17:39.733 --> 17:44.560
people, so-called redneck bikers, jocks

17:46.177 --> 18:15.002
all re-examined who they were and how they were 
treating people themselves and other people

17:46.177 --> 18:15.002
hippies were really open they were willing to run 
tremendous risks as far as physical abuse or

17:46.177 --> 18:15.002
verbal abuse but I mean they ran dangerous risks 
just by the way they looked and acted which was much

17:46.177 --> 18:15.002
much different from the norm then And all of this, 
at that early stage, I would not have considered

18:16.940 --> 18:20.625
too political. But now I do, because it does affect 
how people relate. And I know that it had an effect.

18:26.714 --> 18:31.041
It had a big effect on the army, the men in the army. 
And they were very loving, open people, were

18:32.223 --> 18:39.994
willing to be warm and close with them. even 
knowing that they had major differences about

18:40.514 --> 18:45.579
what each was doing with their own lives. Army men 
were getting ready to go to Vietnam and kill

18:46.199 --> 18:53.086
people, and the hippies were saying, no, don't do 
that, that isn't a good thing to do. And yet, there

18:54.127 --> 19:01.074
was enough openness and sincerity where it worked 
out.

19:08.001 --> 19:09.542
The hippie scene... We had a lot of, the hippie 
scene was, to a large extent, I thought, centered

19:10.484 --> 19:24.964
originally out in California, and we had a lot of 
interchange between San Francisco and Austin,

19:10.484 --> 19:24.964
people that lived here and traveled out there and 
came back. And then later on, during the 60s, a lot

19:25.745 --> 19:40.204
of people traveling between Austin and New York 
City, Madison, Wisconsin, Michigan, the more

19:25.745 --> 19:40.204
hotbed centers of student activism. But see, to 
me, that gets away from hippies. Hippies, in a way,

19:48.834 --> 20:06.613
they would show up for a major demonstration or a 
major political action, but they were not the ones

19:48.834 --> 20:06.613
who day in and day out worked on trying to get 
together educational materials, did research,

19:48.834 --> 20:06.613
call meetings, did the planning for 
demonstration. All of the things that go into

20:09.816 --> 20:17.228
political activism, most hippies were not 
heavily involved in. But they would participate

20:18.671 --> 20:24.480
whenever something made sense to them, and 
participate in good ways. So they were a big

20:24.560 --> 20:33.495
political force, but I always wished they had been 
more more concerted and more intensive in what

20:34.994 --> 20:38.698
they were doing. But so be it.

20:44.405 --> 20:47.168
Does that hand come close to talking about what you 
needed on that? Okay. Was there a difference

20:48.490 --> 20:50.892
between anti-war people and hippies? That's 
something that I just said. I like

20:54.376 --> 21:03.567
it. I'd say 98% of the hippies were anti-war 
people. There might have been 2% that were so

21:08.294 --> 21:24.676
spaced out that they wouldn't vocalize or state a 
position on it, but war and that whole notion is

21:08.294 --> 21:24.676
directly contrary to what I understand to be a 
hippie set of principles. The anti-war people are

21:27.079 --> 21:33.688
the ones that I think of as more organized, more 
concerted and intensive in their efforts the

21:35.643 --> 21:50.877
anti-war movement was made up of

21:35.643 --> 21:50.877
a number of different elements.

21:50.897 --> 21:59.084
I'll kind of give you a rundown on what my analysis 
is and how it was made up, how it was grouped. Of

21:59.104 --> 22:04.789
course, when you're talking about the left in the 
United States, you're not talking about a highly

21:59.104 --> 22:04.789
organized discipline structured thing. It 
didn't happen that way. There were some groups

22:09.964 --> 22:23.141
that were highly organized and disciplined that 
then worked together in the larger meetings to try

22:09.964 --> 22:23.141
to influence the politics of it. There were a lot of 
sectarian groups, what I call sectarian people,

22:23.161 --> 22:31.512
who had a rigid set of beliefs. A lot of them were 
Marxist-Leninists. who some of the groups,

22:34.688 --> 22:50.002
progressive labor, the Trotskyists, if you want 
to be nasty, you call them Trotskyites, but

22:34.688 --> 22:50.002
Trotskyists is a fraternal way to talk about it on 
the left. The Communist Party, the CP, which is

22:52.184 --> 22:56.648
about as liberal as the Democratic Party. I mean, 
it's really the Communist Party of the United

22:56.668 --> 23:02.113
States is a very milquetoast, lukewarm group. as 
far as, I mean they believe in electoral politics

23:02.819 --> 23:15.692
and lots of

23:02.819 --> 23:15.692
dialogue and debate and they're very careful 
about being law abiding. But you had the sectarian

23:15.712 --> 23:28.685
groups, another significant element in the 
anti-war movement was there were the church

23:15.712 --> 23:28.685
groups, the Quakers, the pacifists.

23:29.106 --> 23:30.447
Then you had the hippies and the students that, as I 
indicated a minute ago, would show up, would

23:32.114 --> 23:44.890
participate

23:32.114 --> 23:44.890
in major events or certain things. The main thrust 
of the anti-war movement, where all the heavy duty

23:46.352 --> 23:59.168
stuff came from, where the student activists, the 
new left people, the SDS, The national groups in

23:59.502 --> 24:07.871
the anti-war movement were called the 
mobilization mob, it was called. And whenever a

24:07.891 --> 24:22.147
particular event would come up, there'd almost 
always be a different grouping of national

24:07.891 --> 24:22.147
organizations that would come together and form 
an ad hoc, one-time

24:07.891 --> 24:22.147
structure to handle it. But where the guts of those 
things came from, the big ones, the highly

24:22.187 --> 24:27.012
successful ones, were the New Left SDS people. 
Those were the ones that I really identified with.

24:35.733 --> 24:45.707
And I guess, I think now, the only organization 
that I remember or that I'm proud of being a part of

24:35.733 --> 24:45.707
was SDS. Even though I was a different age level, 
they had a broad definition of what a student was.

24:56.422 --> 25:07.160
As do I, I'm a student of life and we're all students 
and teachers and anybody that gets into narrow

24:56.422 --> 25:07.160
categories on those subjects is making a mistake. 
At any rate, SDS and the New Left people gave the big

25:07.180 --> 25:16.115
thrust to it.

25:19.962 --> 25:20.843
There were some some few dave delger in particular 
comes to mind is is one who for years had been active

25:21.295 --> 25:46.746
in a very organized disciplined way although he 
wasn't in any sectarian group i think he's

25:21.295 --> 25:46.746
probably a a non-violent i know he's a non-violent 
pacifist approach now that does not mean that i

25:21.295 --> 25:46.746
mean passive towards human life. I mean, he 
doesn't believe in taking human life. That does

25:50.963 --> 25:55.729
not mean he wouldn't destroy our property or 
something of that sort. There's all kinds of

25:55.749 --> 25:58.693
distinctions that come up. But Dellinger was one 
of the few big national leaders who had several

25:58.993 --> 26:06.082
decades of experience before the 60s. I think he 
spent the early part of most of World War II in jail

26:06.763 --> 26:14.893
because he wasn't willing to go military. because 
of his social convictions, political

26:16.578 --> 26:20.743
convictions. Okay, the anti-war movement, it 
shifted forms from time to time depending on what

26:20.763 --> 26:30.536
the event was, whether it was national, regional, 
local.

26:33.860 --> 26:39.147
There were major fights to control the politics of 
those events. I don't think the Communist Party

26:41.409 --> 26:43.412
ever wielded much influence. The Trotskyists 
caused quite a bit of conflict I think up east where

26:45.435 --> 26:56.206
they have a number of old left traditions going 
back 50, 60, 70 years. People who came over from

26:57.427 --> 27:11.121
Europe who were socialists or revolutionaries 
and a lot of them were Trotskyists or became

26:57.427 --> 27:11.121
Trotskyists after the mess in Russia occurred 
when Stalin brutalized and murdered A lot of

27:11.506 --> 27:23.421
people in the 1930s, a lot of people left the 
so-called Communist Party and became

27:11.506 --> 27:23.421
Trotskyists or various things.

27:23.441 --> 27:35.817
But I know we had some problems here in Austin with 
the Trotskyist groups, but they never were in tune

27:23.441 --> 27:35.817
enough with

27:23.441 --> 27:35.817
the major number of people around to have a whole 
lot of influence. They were always very

27:35.837 --> 27:37.499
law-abiding. They always wanted to have 
highly... disciplined approach to a

27:41.932 --> 27:44.476
demonstration. I mean, they didn't want any 
spontaneity or anybody

27:44.536 --> 27:57.054
doing something that hadn't been discussed and 
agreed upon by then, which didn't work in Austin.

27:57.074 --> 28:00.219
They'd say, fuck you, we're going to go. You do what 
you want to do, and we'll do what we're going to do,

28:00.379 --> 28:04.826
and we'll meet you down there if you want to come. 
But they're very... If you know your politics very

28:09.809 --> 28:16.256
well, you know that the old left sectarians are 
very much like the so-called moral majority

28:09.809 --> 28:16.256
people. They're very puritanical and believe 
their way is right and you've got to live a rigid...

28:16.276 --> 28:24.065
No dope, no smoking, no fucking... They've got 
screwed up notions about everything that's fun in

28:25.347 --> 28:28.591
life. If you like alcohol and sex and music and 
dancing and things like that, then the old left and

28:29.051 --> 28:39.343
the moral majority have a lot in common. They're 
all backed up.

28:46.626 --> 28:51.193
Now, that's kind of a general overview about the 
anti-war movement. Are there more specifics?

28:53.035 --> 29:00.786
That was

28:53.035 --> 29:00.786
good. I mean, we got an overview there of Austin at 
the time. Okay, now I'll very broad define the

29:05.893 --> 29:09.398
movement. I've

29:11.555 --> 29:23.995
been trying to think all week, trying to remember a 
lot of this to make it easier to talk about. In the

29:24.015 --> 29:38.659
first place, the movement was made up of a number of 
different groups, individuals, and ideas.

29:39.770 --> 29:53.109
So I can only tell you what I think of as a movement 
and what I think was kind of a general thing as far as

29:39.770 --> 29:53.109
highly political people, which I consider myself 
to be, how they viewed it. In the early 60s, the

29:54.050 --> 30:07.389
movement was the Civil Rights Movement, 
primarily concerned with racism and civil

29:54.050 --> 30:07.389
rights, and I participated in that heavily.

30:08.871 --> 30:09.692
A little later, It became involved in the 
Southeast Asian war situation. Another aspect of

30:19.791 --> 30:31.090
it was student rights, student rebellion against 
authority structures and a lot of the ways that

30:19.791 --> 30:31.090
universities and their life was structured.

30:34.343 --> 30:37.268
There's a very good paper called Student as 
Nigger. I don't know whether you've ever read it or

30:37.688 --> 30:50.670
not, but it lays out what at that time was thought of 
as a pretty good view about how certain people are

30:37.688 --> 30:50.670
channeled and they try to make people fit into 
molds. Another part of the movement in Texas, not

30:50.710 --> 31:00.165
true in all states, but certainly true in Texas, 
was

30:50.710 --> 31:00.165
the farm workers, La Raza. During the early and 
middle 60s there were a number of fairly major

31:01.175 --> 31:17.954
demonstrations which finally years and years 
later enough pressure was exerted where they

31:01.175 --> 31:17.954
attained some legislation that was beneficial. 
But part of the movement was Chicano rights or

31:17.994 --> 31:26.203
Chicano issue oriented.

31:28.360 --> 31:52.877
In the latter 60s and early 70s, there was a growth 
or more focus and conscious effort as far as the

31:28.360 --> 31:52.877
relationship between sexes, women, the women's 
movement, which was part of what I think of as the

31:28.360 --> 31:52.877
movement.

31:52.897 --> 31:54.840
By my view, you could not be a member of you weren't 
an authentic member of the movement unless you had

31:55.242 --> 32:19.107
certain good views about all of these issues in 
other words but we were all realists too i mean we

31:55.242 --> 32:19.107
knew that some people or anymore who were very 
macho and racist

31:55.242 --> 32:19.107
so you tried to have an impact on all of that at the 
same time you're working on whatever the event was

31:55.242 --> 32:19.107
at the time And there were some major arguments and 
major fights. And that was one of the beautiful

32:23.162 --> 32:40.130
things about all of those days was those meetings 
and the interchange between people about how they

32:23.162 --> 32:40.130
looked at life, how they treated each other, 
whether they were racist, whether they were

32:23.162 --> 32:40.130
sexist, whether they were fair to each other. And 
it caused a lot of changes. I think the women's

32:45.800 --> 32:56.313
movement at least has had some margin of success at 
changing some of the Chicano macho

32:45.800 --> 32:56.313
culture. I mean, I think it's had an impact on it. 
I'm not saying it radically changed, but it's

32:58.736 --> 33:02.301
obvious it hadn't. Well, it's substantially 
changed from what it was 20 years ago, believe me.

33:15.601 --> 33:24.217
In

33:15.601 --> 33:24.217
the early, there was a progression that went on. In 
the early 60s, all these various issues were

33:24.257 --> 33:29.847
addressed by various groups and individuals. 
Major efforts were made. You guys doing okay? I'd

33:32.623 --> 33:33.444
like some coffee. Okay. And results were not 
obtained, and there was a radicalization process

33:34.525 --> 33:40.272
that went on. I mean, you keep appealing to reason. 
I mean, you keep saying, Mr. Congressman, Mr.

33:44.497 --> 33:46.419
Senator, Mr. President, Mr. Governor, you know, 
blah, blah, blah, blah, blah. For ABC reasons, you

33:49.402 --> 34:00.255
ought to do this, and all they do is give you 
bullshit and weasel around and continue to do what

33:49.402 --> 34:00.255
is obviously the thing they shouldn't do, you 
finally understand that there's shit in this

34:00.623 --> 34:06.391
house. Something stinks. It ain't working. Don't 
tell me that it does. Let me say at this point that I

34:12.298 --> 34:21.571
work professionally in liberal Democratic Party 
politics. In the early 1960s, I was part of a

34:22.392 --> 34:27.238
statewide organization called the Texas 
Democratic Coalition. I was a statewide field

34:27.826 --> 34:39.886
director of that group, and we had 23 projects 
around the state in all the major cities which had

34:27.826 --> 34:39.886
significant minority representation, blacks 
and Chicanos. And we had an organization that got,

34:39.946 --> 34:54.711
at that point in time, it was considered major 
amounts of money from an outfit called the Voter

34:39.946 --> 34:54.711
Education Project out of Atlanta, Georgia, which 
in turn got its money originally from The up east

34:55.079 --> 35:04.823
old liberal families like the Stern Foundation, 
the Kennedys, Marshall.

35:07.830 --> 35:13.223
There are two or three of the old big rich families 
up east that are liberal oriented. They pipelined

35:13.979 --> 35:25.410
money down to the voter education project, which 
then put it out to various places, like the Texas

35:13.979 --> 35:25.410
Democratic Coalition, which then did a lot of 
voter registration and get out the vote work. And I

35:26.191 --> 35:31.536
was involved full-time, paid professional with 
that effort. And at that point, we had the most

35:31.556 --> 35:38.443
volunteer workers. I don't know whether they've 
passed it now. I guess they have. But I know doing

35:41.958 --> 35:49.265
that in one year, we had something like 14,000 
volunteers and block workers in major cities. And

35:50.125 --> 35:56.711
we increased the black voter registration in the 
Chicanos dramatically during that period. I also

35:56.731 --> 36:08.182
worked for a guy for a year and a half who ran for 
governor, a man named Don Yarborough, who almost

35:56.731 --> 36:08.182
beat John Connolly in 1960.

36:08.282 --> 36:09.703
Yeah, 1960.

36:12.046 --> 36:20.418
I

36:12.046 --> 36:20.418
think Connolly won that thing by less than a 
percentage point. Then I worked for the

36:20.438 --> 36:21.960
Democratic Coalition. I eventually became the 
state executive secretary of that, which was the

36:21.980 --> 36:26.767
top position. Larry Goodwin, the guy I was talking 
about a minute ago, at that point, he's the one who

36:28.189 --> 36:36.682
got me into that Democratic Coalition to start 
with. He had a profound impact on my life. He was a

36:41.257 --> 36:45.166
speechwriter and a very intelligent person. And 
he was the first executive secretary of the

36:45.186 --> 36:49.576
Democratic Coalition. He worked in the campaigns 
of Ralph Yarber, the senator at that time, Don

36:50.077 --> 36:54.326
Yarber. I did all those things and worked with 
Larry, too. learned a lot from him in later years

36:59.785 --> 37:23.728
and he went back to the University of Texas, got his 
PhD in history and now is a tenured professor of

36:59.785 --> 37:23.728
history over at Duke and writes books published by 
the Oxford University Press about populism and

36:59.785 --> 37:23.728
radicalism in the South and he's the one who's the 
oral history, has a big interest in oral history.

37:23.748 --> 37:29.033
Okay, so I went through that, I'm a pro, or I was, 20 
years ago at Democratic Party politics, we had a

37:29.418 --> 37:33.885
lot of major convention fights. John Kennedy, 
Jack Kennedy, of course, they got money to us. They

37:40.476 --> 37:45.143
did not like Lyndon Johnson and his brand of 
politics, but they were in bed with him. It had to be

37:45.163 --> 37:49.030
if they figured to win. But at the same time, they 
were feeding us money, hoping that that situation

37:51.053 --> 37:54.919
would change.

37:57.346 --> 38:00.914
the year that, of course, Lyndon Johnson hated our 
guts and we hated his.

38:04.602 --> 38:12.980
But when Jack Kennedy got killed and Lyndon became 
president, then that became too much for the

38:04.602 --> 38:12.980
organized Texas liberal Democrats at that point 
in time. Lyndon as president just exerted too much

38:13.281 --> 38:15.586
power. As vice president, with his connections 
with major oil and major industries and finance

38:18.068 --> 38:22.533
people. He had lots of power, but nothing like what 
you have whenever you're the top electoral

38:22.874 --> 38:33.146
official.

38:33.166 --> 38:36.270
And he cut off that money from the East. It came down 
to the Voter Education Project. Of course, a lot of

38:39.113 --> 38:42.337
the money came from the Voter Education Project. A 
lot of it came from the AFL-CIO unions. And, of

38:47.431 --> 39:01.250
course,

38:47.431 --> 39:01.250
I'll never forget the way he fucked over the United 
Auto Workers and the steel workers and made them

38:47.431 --> 39:01.250
cave in on a lot of the Democratic Party convention 
fights. He didn't have to come down here to Texas.

39:07.780 --> 39:10.584
Neither did Walter Ruther, who was in the head of 
the UAW. I mean, they'd sit up there and cut their

39:10.604 --> 39:12.767
deals, make a deal. I think the guy's name was 
McDonald, who was head of the steel workers then.

39:16.131 --> 39:17.353
He was an asshole. They'd cut a deal with Linden, 
and then they'd pick up the phone and call their top

39:17.907 --> 39:26.538
guy in Texas, and those were two of the biggest 
unions in Texas, tremendous power inside the

39:17.907 --> 39:26.538
Lakeland. And they'd say, bullshit, don't do that 
liberal thing. You do what Linden wants you to do.

39:32.946 --> 39:36.170
We're going to have something just happen on our 
contract. There's going to be so many millions

39:36.330 --> 39:40.895
spent on that aircraft plant. But don't fuck 
around. I'm a pro. I mean, I know how that shit

39:46.052 --> 39:50.641
works, which makes me fully realize that 
democracy does not exist. It is something that I

39:51.182 --> 40:02.705
want to see exist, and it's, I think, an attainable 
goal, but people in the United States should not

39:51.182 --> 40:02.705
fool themselves into thinking that they have a 
democracy, because they do not. It's highly

40:03.226 --> 40:04.269
rigged. It depends upon the media and who's got the 
money and who controls the educational system.

40:09.077 --> 40:16.365
And a lot of, I mean, you have to take a pretty 
examined study of it to understand how people are

40:09.077 --> 40:16.365
channeled and manipulated. There's not any tight 
conspiracy by capitalists. I don't believe that

40:19.629 --> 40:20.570
shit. But it is obvious that they've got a 
community of interest and they damn sure do their

40:21.431 --> 40:26.977
homework. And ABC, NBC, CBS are all controlled by 
the same kind of people. They're all people who

40:33.102 --> 40:36.607
have the vested interest, the status quo at heart. 
And they don't want to see changes. Same way with

40:38.849 --> 40:45.518
all the major corporations owned by, or 
controlled, owned and controlled by the same kind

40:38.849 --> 40:45.518
of folks. And they take care of their homework as 
far as the legislatures and the congresses and the

40:45.538 --> 40:52.827
school boards and the city councils. There's 
occasional slip-ups, but they have enough

40:52.847 --> 40:57.133
safeguards where nothing ever runs wild.

40:59.796 --> 41:01.118
You might get a city who think they're going to do 
some zoning out somewhere outside their city

41:02.279 --> 41:07.627
limits to protect their aquifer. But then they'll 
soon find out from their lawyers and all that that

41:07.647 --> 41:11.833
belongs to the county government. And then you'll 
find out that the state never has given the county

41:11.853 --> 41:16.520
governments the right to zone. So that means that 
the developers get to do whatever the fuck they

41:16.540 --> 41:20.145
want to out there. So it's a pretty sophisticated 
system that exists, but it looks after the major

41:20.947 --> 41:31.442
interests of property owners and 
profit-motivated So democracy doesn't exist.

41:38.006 --> 41:47.137
You can go through the academic bullshit, which a 
lot of teachers and professors like to do, but I

41:38.006 --> 41:47.137
don't think it's worthwhile where you can say, 
well, it's better here than it's better there.

41:50.502 --> 41:53.986
To me, we've got lousy situations in most of the 
world. And the question is, what can we do about it?

41:59.215 --> 42:02.600
And the major thing is we gotta speak the truth. I 
mean, you can't lie, you can't bullshit each

42:02.721 --> 42:05.385
other. So that's why I always try to make the point 
that we do not have a democratic system. It is

42:10.493 --> 42:11.595
highly controlled. You do not get on the media to 
express opinions that are contrary to the major

42:12.937 --> 42:20.049
thing. By the way, on this very subject, I did run 
for governor in 1968. Yeah, that's when Lyndon,

42:28.291 --> 42:54.317
I was working with the, you know, I've been doing a 
lot of different things all during that period of

42:28.291 --> 42:54.317
time, and I was working with a lot of the SDS New Left 
people out at the University of Texas, and

42:28.291 --> 42:54.317
Lyndon was president, Vietnam War, the Civil 
Rights Movement, all of those things were getting

42:28.291 --> 42:54.317
a lot of attention. That election was coming up, 
and And I'm adding it's still true today. The way

43:00.721 --> 43:13.761
the law read then, the television networks do not 
have to save you time if you want to go on television

43:00.721 --> 43:13.761
with spots about the war and racism and poverty. 
They do not have to let you own that tube. Don't ever

43:16.165 --> 43:21.253
be naive enough to think that if you get the money 
together that you can buy spots. You can if they

43:21.273 --> 43:23.577
want you to. But the exception to that, according 
to their theory and their law, is that if you're a

43:24.097 --> 43:37.411
candidate, an officially declared candidate, 
then they have to sell you the time on the same basis

43:24.097 --> 43:37.411
they do the others. So all of us knew that. We wanted 
to mount a television campaign on those three

43:40.875 --> 43:46.080
issues, war and racism and poverty. And the only 
way we could be assured that even if we got those

43:46.901 --> 43:52.787
beautiful spots together, 20 and 30 second spots, 
and got the money together to buy the town, that we

43:53.712 --> 43:58.319
could get them on was to have a declared candidate. 
So I ran for governor. And we got another man

44:01.544 --> 44:11.218
who ran for lieutenant governor that he's since 
got fired, or got fired, or got moved out. He used to

44:12.640 --> 44:21.694
be a professor of history down at, or government, I 
guess it was, down at Southwest Texas State in San

44:12.640 --> 44:21.694
Marcos. named Bill Malone. He wrote the 
authoritative book on country music called

44:23.337 --> 44:27.424
Country Music USA. He's a musician and 
musicologist as well as a history of government

44:27.444 --> 44:32.693
man. Very fine fellow. I think he's down at LSU or 
Tulane. Hey, Fletcher. It has nothing to do with

44:37.702 --> 44:41.849
what exists in Russia or the Communist Party. I 
mean, it's my own definition of what... a good life

44:46.514 --> 44:57.391
in society is about, and a whole lot of that is 
communal and people sharing property and

44:46.514 --> 44:57.391
resources and not being able to control it 
privately. At any rate, I ran for governor, and

44:57.411 --> 45:10.132
Bill Malone ran for lieutenant governor, and the 
purpose was so that networks over Texas would have

44:57.411 --> 45:10.132
to sell us that town. So then I went up east to New 
York City,

45:16.180 --> 45:24.310
to try to raise the money and get the expertise 
together to get those spots made and to get them on

45:16.180 --> 45:24.310
the air. And I had a pretty good amount of success 
because by then the liberal establishment, the

45:26.694 --> 45:40.511
big PR firms on Madison Avenue, the biggest one, 
Thompson's something or another, something or

45:26.694 --> 45:40.511
another, was one of the ones I went to. They were 
opposed to the war. The majority of the top people

45:42.153 --> 45:45.698
in that outfit were. And

45:47.365 --> 46:00.484
I met a lot of filmmakers who were making all kinds 
of films all across the country about the war,

45:47.365 --> 46:00.484
about racism, a lot of that. We finally had it 
worked out where they were gonna make those spots.

46:05.811 --> 46:13.503
At that point, I think it cost, I think it cost 
$60,000 to make a 20-second spot. Of course, now,

46:14.664 --> 46:16.647
that same spot, It would cost 400, 500, you know, 
400. But these people were going to do it. I mean,

46:21.999 --> 46:25.082
they were going to donate their time, their 
facilities. They were going to make those spots

46:25.562 --> 46:26.863
for us. Well, we were going to maintain control. I 
mean, no way. I'd already been educated enough

46:29.706 --> 46:36.772
where I knew that you've got to maintain editorial 
control or you're fucked. So our agreement here

46:37.572 --> 46:46.600
locally was the SDS, New Left people were going to 
put together a group which would have the final say

46:37.572 --> 46:46.600
on the content of those spots. So all of that was 
agreed upon, and we even got our scheme together

46:46.867 --> 46:51.171
about how we were going to raise money. I don't want 
to go into all of that, but in effect what happened

46:51.251 --> 46:58.058
was that Lyndon got out of the race. That's when 
there was a whole lot of pressure on him. He already

47:02.323 --> 47:11.893
knew that he was damn near whipped, and there was a 
guy running against the incumbent congressman

47:02.323 --> 47:11.893
here who was running on an anti-Lyndon. This was 
Lyndon's old congressional seat, and it was a

47:12.093 --> 47:16.317
Lyndon come home. This guy used to be a London 
supporter, but he was saying, Mr. President, you

47:16.853 --> 47:23.949
done fucked up, come on, we love you, but you belong 
down here, you don't belong up there. At any rate,

47:24.671 --> 47:28.761
all of that heavy pressure was coming down all 
across the society. They were having major

47:28.781 --> 47:33.732
problems with the anti-war movement, the student 
movement, the civil rights movement.
