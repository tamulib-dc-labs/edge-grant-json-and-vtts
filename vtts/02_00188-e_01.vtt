WEBVTT

00:03.085 --> 00:04.267
Valentine's Day. This is Valentine's Day. We're 
testing.

00:11.799 --> 00:19.450
To continue, sir, yesterday you were talking 
about, or the day before yesterday, the faculty as

00:11.799 --> 00:19.450
a family here. How did the faculty work together 
and share and cooperate? First off, there were

00:31.604 --> 00:37.451
There were a number of houses here that the people 
lived in. That is, the residences, sort of thing.

00:41.776 --> 00:47.863
Not only that, there's some of them had little 
houses back of them for horses. I know several that

00:49.785 --> 00:52.308
had that. Well, but... And some had milk cows? Oh 
yeah, yeah, milk cows. Chickens? Yeah. Garden? I

01:02.013 --> 01:03.255
don't assume they did. Yeah, you could because it 
was open. There were no regulations against it.

01:11.004 --> 01:15.330
Did they have a little place for their maid to live? 
Some of them did. Now, most of the supplementary

01:17.453 --> 01:25.243
people were Negroes. And they came in the south 
side of this thing. They came from downtown. uh

01:33.181 --> 02:01.281
welborn way or somewhere's in there it was that 
away i don't know they came up through we were the

01:33.181 --> 02:01.281
last house on the on that street and uh they came by 
our house early in the morning and they spread out

01:33.181 --> 02:01.281
through the through the campus i'm sure that there 
must have been some in the northern part of the

01:33.181 --> 02:01.281
campus where they wouldn't walk that far but uh 
They were Negro maids and women, and they were paid

02:02.273 --> 02:14.230
by the faculty women to take care of them. Now, when 
you had wash day, which is usually Monday, you had

02:15.672 --> 02:30.593
additional help, and that was furnished lots of 
times by students. Students went in there, and I

02:32.125 --> 02:43.058
know a fellow by the name of Scott, who one time or 
later was chief engineer for the city of Bryan. He

02:43.158 --> 02:54.872
used to come to our house at 6 o'clock in the morning 
and start that iron pot out there and all of that

02:43.158 --> 02:54.872
thing, you know, and they washed his clothes. And 
everybody had their clothes line in the backyard?

02:57.835 --> 02:58.556
Yes, right. They had a clothes line back there. And 
they worked that. Now, each one of those houses

03:04.940 --> 03:14.492
was, the departments had a home for their head of 
their department. And the one we lived in for five

03:15.594 --> 03:27.650
years from 1919 to 1924 was dedicated to the 
etymology department. But Dr. Bilsing was

03:27.670 --> 03:30.313
single. So he didn't qualify. He lived in Bryan, I 
think, somewhere.

03:39.565 --> 03:47.957
Or they had some single

03:39.565 --> 03:47.957
places for him to live, like dormitories.

03:50.782 --> 03:52.604
Did every house have a garage? Yes, almost all of 
them did, even to the fact that it was the as I said, a

04:00.652 --> 04:04.177
barn. And it depended on how much they had to have. 
The one across the street where the Hazes lived, it

04:12.349 --> 04:21.663
had a full-scale barn behind it with a hayloft in 
it. And that was the only one down there, I

04:23.145 --> 04:29.815
remember, that was there.

04:30.554 --> 04:59.295
They, those departments, they had all those 
houses scattered out, and that's where they, and

04:30.554 --> 04:59.295
each one of them had its own department, and the 
thing you had to do, the,

04:30.554 --> 04:59.295
well,

05:01.958 --> 05:07.084
You had a society that was entirely different than 
anything you ever saw before.

05:09.887 --> 05:11.388
Here's the head of the department. He had a whole 
bunch of men under him. And their families were

05:14.452 --> 05:17.295
there. They had other houses. Or they were in 
Bryan, or mostly in Bryan, because that's all the

05:19.998 --> 05:28.307
way you get back and forth.

05:28.908 --> 05:30.109
There wasn't any housing. outside when we first 
came here. There was no housing outside. There

05:35.364 --> 05:40.448
were a number of farmers out there that had homes 
and stuff like this. So there were children

05:42.070 --> 05:43.551
involved. But they came into the school system, 
that's the way. But the,

05:48.735 --> 05:57.343
well, we went to church in Guyon Hall. They had 
Sunday school there. I was in the kids' small

06:00.852 --> 06:10.845
children's boys' class, and Dr. Reed was the one 
that took care of us. And his house was the first

06:12.688 --> 06:26.987
house east and south of Guy Haller's house there. 
But at the end of the Sunday school, they would have

06:30.957 --> 06:32.399
church. And at that point in time, the

06:33.560 --> 06:42.452
Corps came in. And they marched in and sat down. I 
mean, that guy in the hall would sit 2,700 people.

06:54.849 --> 06:59.435
Did any of the Corps ever do any pranks or anything 
during church? Oh, yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Most of them,

07:01.585 --> 07:07.393
they unbutton their things and they put a little 
magazine in there. And you sit there and

07:07.413 --> 07:14.824
read. I never went to church there, but we were not 
required to. Where did you all go to church? We

07:26.320 --> 07:27.021
didn't go to church. Oh, you didn't go to church 
then? We went to Sunday school. Okay. Okay.

07:30.593 --> 07:34.396
William Sunday School was just like church. 
Reverend Matthews got up there and waved his hands

07:34.777 --> 07:42.423
around like this, and we were singing and wearing 
those. And so that's the way. And he had a house that

07:45.966 --> 07:59.098
was just straight east of the, next to the 
Commandant's house, across the street there.

07:59.973 --> 08:05.619
Now, the president's big house was just west of 
Sabisa. Yeah, it was just west of Sabisa. That's

08:08.042 --> 08:09.083
where he lived. Were there any other big houses on 
campus? Oh, yes. There was a line of big houses on

08:14.809 --> 08:19.133
the other side of Quality Road. Okay. We called it 
Quality Road. On the east side, the first one was

08:21.776 --> 08:26.641
the Hayes House. It's a big old brick house. I mean, 
it was brick with, uh, with, uh, the structure was

08:28.525 --> 08:37.434
brick, and then it was stuccoed on the outside. And 
then it skipped a house. The next house there was a

08:41.158 --> 08:45.883
wooden house, and the Templeton lived in it. And 
then Templeton lived in it. I don't know. And then

08:50.187 --> 08:57.655
the Selby house came into being, the next one up, 
and it was a, a big brick house with, uh, uh, stuff on

08:58.563 --> 09:04.350
it. And then it, uh, Dean Pereer's house was there. 
Pereer? Yeah. And then, uh, Dean Ball had a house.

09:19.329 --> 09:19.670
Now, what? I mean, Dr. Ball. Oh, okay. Not Dean 
Ball, Dr. Ball. He was a I never understood what he

09:26.238 --> 09:51.132
was, but he was always after, he and,

09:26.238 --> 09:51.132
I don't know whether it was Mark Steller, I don't 
think it was, it was somebody in the vet school,

09:26.238 --> 09:51.132
they were always after finding these skillets of 
small horses. that whole, there's something

09:51.533 --> 09:57.220
around here somewhere with a whole bunch of them. 
They used to be in

09:57.260 --> 10:01.906
Francis Hall. They used to be in there. And so 
that's where that, but the society that we had was

10:07.634 --> 10:21.051
that the head of the department and all of the 
people They had a, they just would go visit people.

10:29.090 --> 10:29.590
And did they? Numbers of times when we would come 
out of Sunday school, and dad or mother would say,

10:30.952 --> 10:37.259
don't take your Sundays off. We got to go, we got to 
go visit somebody, or we got to go to dinner with

10:37.299 --> 10:42.946
somebody. I remember after Dr. Beltsy married, we 
went and Had dinner with them. Now, if the family

10:51.296 --> 10:58.743
was going to go eat out, was there a restaurant or a 
cafe? No, there was no place to eat. Had to go all the

11:02.287 --> 11:04.309
way to downtown Bryan, didn't they? Well, of 
course, the Corps was fed in Spiegel. And it always

11:13.478 --> 11:16.941
marched in the company front. Did you and other 
family, did y'all ever eat much in Sabeasa?

11:26.454 --> 11:28.097
Faculty didn't go there much to eat. Not that I 
remember. I was never in there for a meal. All the

11:35.130 --> 11:38.035
time I was there, I never was in there for a meal. But 
we would go. In the afternoons, you had a whole

11:40.192 --> 11:42.915
afternoon. You had no

11:42.995 --> 11:51.365
radio, no engagements. The only thing you had was a 
picture show. Was it okay for little boys to play

11:55.210 --> 11:59.695
out on Sunday afternoon on campus? Oh, yeah. Okay, 
so you could go play. Oh, yeah, Dr. Dean

12:01.958 --> 12:08.325
Boulder. His yard was a pretty good size. There'd 
be about ten of us in there. We'd have a football or

12:18.015 --> 12:21.760
we'd have a ball of some sort. We'd play there and 
then all of a sudden down the road there, Dad would

12:22.721 --> 12:35.016
come along in the car and he'd signal, come on home. 
That was all there was to it. When you were growing

12:38.444 --> 12:47.213
up, do you remember any really bad weather, bad 
snow, bad ice, a flood, or anything like that?

12:47.773 --> 12:49.035
There was a tornado here. Really? What happened? 
Well,

12:54.100 --> 13:02.889
one morning,

12:54.100 --> 13:02.889
I remember it very distinctly. I was in the office, 
right down here someplace, underneath this

13:08.178 --> 13:10.360
place. That's where the Ag and Air Building was. It 
was an old wooden structure. And it had a, behind

13:15.926 --> 13:21.011
it, it had a big, old barn. The, what they called it, 
the, uh, the Regranovy Building, or the

13:22.312 --> 13:31.982
Agriculture Building, was built in 24. So in 19, it 
was, it wasn't there. That was the big old building

13:36.983 --> 13:41.789
they trained the soldiers in to drive cars. That's 
what that was for. But across the street where the

13:45.454 --> 13:52.543
engineering building is now was another wooden 
building. It had a pitched roof on it and it had two

13:52.563 --> 14:02.856
sides to it and it was full of machinery that was 
loaned to college for instruction

14:03.882 --> 14:14.594
by various companies. I.C., John Deere, and other 
companies, and there were some odd ones in there,

14:15.154 --> 14:24.504
too. But on the second floor of that thing, it was a 
big second floor, when that tornado hit that

14:24.524 --> 14:31.712
thing, He took the roof off it, just the pitch roof, 
took it over the provision, and about several

14:32.519 --> 14:48.528
hundred yards, the other side of it, threw it on the 
ground. I remember. About when was this tornado?

14:51.734 --> 14:52.195
Do you remember? It was probably about 1922. It was 
about in there somewhere. Did it do any damage to

15:00.282 --> 15:03.006
your house where y'all were living? The only thing 
it did damage to was that one building that housed

15:03.086 --> 15:15.180
all

15:03.086 --> 15:15.180
the ag engineering farm machinery. And nobody got 
hurt badly? Nobody got hurt. The only thing it did,

15:18.244 --> 15:26.353
when it went over this old building that was behind 
the ag engineering, it dropped one of the post, a

15:28.105 --> 15:34.173
very big old post, and dropped that, and it went 
right through the roof and hit the floor. Ka-bam!

15:38.519 --> 15:47.711
So that, nobody seems to know anything about that 
area, that thing, but it was, it turned, I can draw

15:38.519 --> 15:47.711
you pictures of it. The roof was like this. It was,

15:50.074 --> 15:56.543
it was, it was, regular, Pitch roof, there's two 
sides here. And then all of a sudden, when that roof

16:01.485 --> 16:09.717
went off, these sides laid down flat on each side. 
And then the second floor had no support except

16:09.777 --> 16:14.664
down the middle. And it got a hump in it. It was like a 
camel. And all that machinery slid off on the

16:20.031 --> 16:25.399
ground, and that's what broke it up. And Dad, he 
told all the people in the department to stay

16:26.105 --> 16:37.375
quiet, and they did. And after it was all over, they 
went over there and looked at it. And he was upset,

16:42.920 --> 16:49.866
because that stuff was on loan to him. And he didn't 
know whether he was going to pay for it or what. So I

16:55.163 --> 17:13.487
remember he went and he had to, a couple of days 
later, he got through some telephone

16:55.163 --> 17:13.487
conversations with some of the people in Dallas 
that he had got the machinery from. And he just

17:14.428 --> 17:22.318
said, well, I got to tuck my tail and go up there and 
ask them what we're going to do about this thing. He

17:23.193 --> 17:37.671
walked into those people, they said, they just 
immediately said, have your botanist take them

17:23.193 --> 17:37.671
apart and list us a piece that you need and we'll 
send it to you. Oh, how good, how good. So that's

17:39.934 --> 17:42.136
what happened to that thing. And he got a rapport 
with those people and he always had with them.

17:50.564 --> 17:56.190
Later on, he became Secretary and Treasurer of 
Texas Airborne. Now, when did he become a

17:56.751 --> 17:58.833
department head? When he got here. Oh, he was 
department head when he came. There were only

18:04.279 --> 18:07.803
three men in the department. And by the time he 
retired, how many were in the department, I

18:07.823 --> 18:13.930
reckon?

18:19.136 --> 18:20.217
It was really lively. I wouldn't know. Was it one of 
the best ag engineering departments in the

18:24.814 --> 18:28.859
country? It was the best. We need to get,

18:31.162 --> 18:39.832
in the Ag Engineering Journal, there is a memorial 
to him. We ought to get that thing. It's printed in

18:42.335 --> 18:43.757
there. Who do you think were some of his closest 
faculty friends? Who were some of his favorite

18:50.791 --> 18:52.913
colleagues? Oh, he got along with most everybody. 
I know, but who were his closest friends? Dean

19:00.062 --> 19:00.763
Kyle. Dean Kyle. Oh.

19:09.556 --> 19:17.466
the Civil Engineering department because he was 
trained for three years in Ohio State. So he got

19:17.486 --> 19:27.619
along with those people, Dr. Ritchie, and then I 
worked for Dr. Ritchie. That was driving those

19:27.699 --> 19:35.749
students in the summertime.

19:37.518 --> 19:50.911
There were several over there in Sandstead, was 
one of them, and there were several in the CE

19:37.518 --> 19:50.911
department that he got along with real good. And 
the only one he didn't get along with was the

19:52.172 --> 20:02.762
English department. Do you know why? Well, yes, I 
do know. See, when he was, the college came down

20:09.231 --> 20:26.115
here, I mean,

20:09.231 --> 20:26.115
the

20:09.231 --> 20:26.115
Hardware and Implement Association approached 
the college. It must have been about 1924 or

20:27.998 --> 20:31.723
something like that. And they said, we need some 
help to run this organization and to get to the

20:32.918 --> 20:42.287
organization. And do you have anybody that could 
take that job? And so it was offered to Dan. And

20:49.373 --> 20:51.715
that's when he joined them. And that's when they 
linked up. Well, yeah, they linked up. And he had a

20:57.721 --> 21:02.385
college, rented them the Well, offices. He had two 
offices in there that were, they were nothing but

21:04.980 --> 21:10.306
secretaries. He ran the whole thing. And he took 
care of everything. And so we made friends all over

21:18.016 --> 21:21.179
the state. Who do you think of all the presidents he 
served under, who was his favorite president? A&M

21:29.649 --> 21:30.330
president. I would say it turned to Dr. Walton. 
T.O. Walton?

21:37.559 --> 21:40.223
Well, they lived right next door to us. See, we were 
there. We were on the end on the west side, and

21:42.466 --> 21:52.761
Walton's had the home adjacent to us. So you were 
good friends before he became president? Oh, yes.

21:57.007 --> 21:57.408
Oh, yes. I mean, he was... working for the 
extension service. He ran the extension service.

22:07.676 --> 22:09.899
Describe Dr. Walton's personality. Oh, he was 
great. He was a pretty good-sized man. I mean, big

22:18.150 --> 22:19.672
man.

22:22.936 --> 22:25.339
But he wasn't that imposing. He carried himself 
well, and... he'd stand there and talk to you just

22:30.453 --> 22:37.043
like you were, kids like you were. And he could get 
up and talk, and that was what really got him to

22:37.203 --> 22:43.452
where he went. Because in those days, you had to 
sell the college. Sure. And you had to get people

22:50.703 --> 22:55.650
out there that could help that. Now, a little bit of 
back history on that was that the Extension

22:59.528 --> 23:15.845
Service was formed

22:59.528 --> 23:15.845
just prior to World War I. Dad was in Mississippi 
and he made an awful lot of good friends over there

23:16.966 --> 23:26.076
amongst the

23:28.604 --> 23:31.728
Agriculture Riders. He went to Europe. Oh, good. 
In 1924. My, my. And was sponsored by the

23:40.097 --> 23:45.844
Agriculture Riders Association. Later, he went 
to Mexico, and then went down there again. And the

23:50.349 --> 23:56.957
funny part about that was they had a Baptist

23:57.950 --> 24:16.459
preacher that was in the group, and they were all 
telling him, you've got to drink beer, you've got

23:57.950 --> 24:16.459
to drink liquor, or wine, or stuff like that, or 
you're going to get sick. And that old Baptist, he

24:17.641 --> 24:25.273
was our boy, and he was getting sick. And when you 
were growing up, what did your parents give you as

24:26.418 --> 24:33.506
your guidelines for what you could not do?

24:36.729 --> 24:42.716
Well, the one thing I couldn't approach, I 
couldn't get mad at my mother. Okay.

24:51.065 --> 24:52.426
What about strong language? Could you use strong 
words? Oh, I haven't. I did a little, but not too

24:56.388 --> 24:58.912
much. Smoking? Drinking? No, we didn't smoke. 
Mother and Dad drank every night. What did they

25:10.492 --> 25:11.333
drink? They drank

25:11.854 --> 25:15.440
beer. Now, where'd they get that during 
Depression years? I mean, during the Prohibition

25:20.689 --> 25:22.632
years? You had near beer. Oh, okay. You had 
Budweiser that only had about half a percent of it.

25:36.243 --> 25:36.623
Yeah. And they would let me drink that. Okay. We'd 
go down. Mother and Dad would go downstairs in the

25:41.388 --> 25:51.859
kitchen before they went to bed, and they would sit 
there and drink one of the bottles of beer. And the

25:52.480 --> 25:56.765
doctors always said that it was good for you. 
That's what they said. And

25:58.947 --> 26:04.233
they do that today. Doctors tell me, go get a small 
drink before you go to bed. In those years, did you

26:12.602 --> 26:16.947
all have an electric refrigerator or an icebox? 
First, we had an icebox. And did the Iceman come to

26:21.978 --> 26:23.920
the house? Yes, he was an old man White. Old man 
White. A big, tall man. His name was White. And he

26:33.850 --> 26:40.316
was a...

26:33.850 --> 26:40.316
You drive a wagon or a car? Or a truck?

26:44.341 --> 26:45.181
I think he had a wagon. But you put... You had some 
little stickers No, they were just stickers. Oh,

26:54.768 --> 26:55.329
okay. And you put that on the back of the door, and 
they told him how much they were going to put in that

26:56.169 --> 27:07.340
box. And originally, that was just one loaded from 
the top, and that was the ice pit, and then it had

27:08.501 --> 27:20.993
some stuff down there. Immediately, almost 
immediately, Dad got a hold of a GE monitor top

27:21.412 --> 27:33.751
refrigerator.

27:33.871 --> 27:42.525
The refrigerant in that is sulfadoxa instead of 
the regular refrigerants we had. And he got one,

27:43.214 --> 27:51.467
and it was a small one. One door, but it had the top on 
it. And that was too small, and so he traded that for

27:56.154 --> 28:05.589
a double door with a 1V monitor top on it. And that 
served us for years. Describe your mother's

28:08.433 --> 28:10.757
routine. In the 20s, when you kids were growing up, 
what did she do? I

28:14.387 --> 28:19.994
don't know what time it was. She bailed out of that 
thing, and the first thing she did was to go get that

28:20.134 --> 28:28.926
folder of coffee and make some coffee. After she 
got that, she was a golden consumer. But that's the

28:35.354 --> 28:40.521
worst thing that ever happened in this house. And 
so it is. And

28:41.888 --> 29:00.091
she worked hard at it, and she cooked, and then she 
called

28:41.888 --> 29:00.091
Luke and Charlie's. Now that's Luke Patronella 
and Charlie Aubergine. I remember that name. They

29:08.582 --> 29:11.226
had a store on Northgate. Mm-hmm. And they 
deliver, did they have a truck or a wagon? I don't, I

29:17.584 --> 29:20.007
don't know. But they delivered the groceries. I 
imagine it was a small truck. Who were your

29:26.033 --> 29:28.096
mother's closest friends? What other ladies were 
her? Oh, Ms. Walton. Ms. Walton came over there

29:33.282 --> 29:39.469
when Dr. Warren deemed us. And daddy went to Brian 
and got him a room. And Mrs. Walden came over there

29:45.375 --> 29:52.044
and asked mother what she needed and went and got 
it. That's the kind of people. And then the Hazes

29:56.931 --> 29:59.174
were across the street. He was something that I'll 
have to look that up. I never knew exactly. But I

30:07.732 --> 30:11.235
think he was in the education department or 
something like that. And then the Wheatlers who

30:12.356 --> 30:17.400
lived in that house later on, they were good 
neighbors. Now, when the Depression hit the

30:18.401 --> 30:25.728
state, the nation, how did life on the campus 
change? It didn't change. Now, did the enrollment

30:27.129 --> 30:29.411
change much? No. Faculty didn't get laid up? No. 
The enrollment didn't change. It kept growing.

30:43.040 --> 30:44.541
Did they lay any faculty off? No, because

30:46.023 --> 31:05.127
Texas has this biennial

30:46.023 --> 31:05.127
appropriation, and

30:46.023 --> 31:05.127
that was straddled in the crash. Uh-huh. We went up 
into 29

31:06.625 --> 31:13.814
or something like that. Probably 28 and 29 is what 
it was. And they were paid good money at that time.

31:24.347 --> 31:33.679
But then immediately following that is when the 
crash hit A&M.

31:34.672 --> 31:39.028
But the students kept coming.
