WEBVTT

00:00:02.343 --> 00:00:09.855
We just couldn't believe that the Japs had taken it upon themselves to bomb Pearl Harbor.

00:00:10.456 --> 00:00:14.643
We couldn't really believe the seriousness of it.

00:00:16.346 --> 00:00:21.675
It was just beyond our belief that they did as much damage as they did.

00:00:21.695 --> 00:00:28.907
We were all listening and all hugging the radios.

00:00:30.254 --> 00:00:33.620
How did life on the campus change soon after that?

00:00:38.730 --> 00:00:41.795
Well, I don't think it changed a whole lot.

00:00:41.815 --> 00:00:43.719
Did you all take things more seriously?

00:00:44.601 --> 00:00:45.522
I would say so.

00:00:46.464 --> 00:00:47.386
I would say so.

00:00:47.406 --> 00:00:51.874
There was more of an incentive to stay in and

00:00:52.765 --> 00:00:55.988
get a degree before you might have to go into the service.

00:00:56.609 --> 00:01:01.774
Now, when did they go to the 12-month trimester?

00:01:02.715 --> 00:01:03.736
Did that affect you?

00:01:03.776 --> 00:01:05.958
That next summer.

00:01:08.080 --> 00:01:16.888
That affected me because part of the requirement for a petroleum engineering degree was three months oil field experience.

00:01:16.908 --> 00:01:21.793
And I learned one thing very important to my life.

00:01:22.381 --> 00:01:24.724
If you want to get experience, you have to have a job.

00:01:25.024 --> 00:01:28.809
If you want to get a job, you have to have experience.

00:01:28.829 --> 00:01:37.600
And I worked for a poor boy job for twenty-two days, twelve hours a day, and got paid two and a half a day.

00:01:38.722 --> 00:01:39.423
In the oil field?

00:01:39.583 --> 00:01:40.304
In the oil field.

00:01:40.404 --> 00:01:41.305
Where?

00:01:41.325 --> 00:01:43.928
In Hebronville, Texas.

00:01:43.948 --> 00:01:52.219
And after I got my twenty-two days experience, so I got four dollars an hour, and those were high wages.

00:01:52.520 --> 00:01:56.466
high wages, but you had to have experience to get those kind of wages.

00:01:57.387 --> 00:02:06.520
As you were doing that work, could you tell that the preparation you had had at A&M made a difference?

00:02:07.481 --> 00:02:08.402
Oh, absolutely.

00:02:09.644 --> 00:02:11.727
Sure, we would have drills on

00:02:12.398 --> 00:02:14.682
on the oil field floor and that sort of thing.

00:02:14.762 --> 00:02:22.033
We knew what tongs were and we knew what elevators were and Waukesha engines and all those sort of things.

00:02:23.015 --> 00:02:28.042
Who were some of the people in petroleum engineering in that era here that were important?

00:02:29.685 --> 00:02:33.211
Were there some great teachers?

00:02:33.231 --> 00:02:37.377
Bob Whiting.

00:02:39.787 --> 00:02:55.203
Of course, I was primarily a mechanical engineer, and so John George Hatch was always there.

00:02:58.006 --> 00:03:00.009
What made him such a fine teacher?

00:03:02.051 --> 00:03:03.172
I think it was his humor.

00:03:04.013 --> 00:03:06.155
He never accepted problems.

00:03:06.315 --> 00:03:08.798
He was always accepting challenges.

00:03:10.060 --> 00:03:18.429
And he didn't see that any of the problems should prevent you from doing your job.

00:03:19.451 --> 00:03:21.913
And he prepared you for the real world, didn't he?

00:03:22.154 --> 00:03:22.634
Yes, he did.

00:03:24.316 --> 00:03:25.157
A wonderful man.

00:03:26.419 --> 00:03:29.222
This is an editor's note to go into this.

00:03:30.323 --> 00:03:36.610
When I was dean of faculties at the commencement when Dr. Thompson retired.

00:03:36.690 --> 00:03:39.173
This is Dr. JGH Thompson.

00:03:40.553 --> 00:03:49.517
We had three or four of the retiring faculty to be a part of the official processional group up on the stage.

00:03:50.375 --> 00:03:51.116
to honor them.

00:03:51.817 --> 00:04:06.560
And when the first mechanical engineering senior came across the stage, he saw Dr. Thompson on the back row up on the stage, and he went through each of the rows of the chairs to shake his hand.

00:04:07.422 --> 00:04:12.670
And every other mechanical engineer followed and did that.

00:04:13.797 --> 00:04:30.813
Later, when the ceremony was over and we went into the letterman's lounge to take off our caps and gowns, two or three of the regents came over to ask me and Vice President Calhoun, why would those students go shake that man's hand that way?

00:04:32.594 --> 00:04:41.222
And we both very proudly assured him it was because those students had such a deep respect

00:04:41.725 --> 00:04:47.992
and gratitude for Dr. Thompson as being a splendid faculty member.

00:04:50.195 --> 00:04:55.421
Am I correct that he also applied theory to reality?

00:04:57.183 --> 00:04:57.403
Yeah.

00:04:59.005 --> 00:05:00.046
Yep, he did.

00:05:00.307 --> 00:05:01.888
Did he have a sense of humor?

00:05:01.909 --> 00:05:02.810
Oh, man, yeah.

00:05:03.010 --> 00:05:04.071
He always smiled.

00:05:05.182 --> 00:05:08.206
And he'd say, you've got a problem?

00:05:08.306 --> 00:05:09.528
What do you mean you've got a problem?

00:05:09.548 --> 00:05:10.449
You mean a challenge?

00:05:12.192 --> 00:05:14.715
He'd grin and laugh.

00:05:14.735 --> 00:05:21.445
So then after the summer of 42, you come back here to A&M.

00:05:22.386 --> 00:05:29.836
And as the war went on, did the routine of classes and student life change?

00:05:32.720 --> 00:05:33.822
Well, I think it did.

00:05:34.477 --> 00:05:49.893
The day was more crowded each day because you just felt that you had to really buckle down and do the job because it was serious business.

00:05:50.273 --> 00:05:50.393
Right.

00:05:50.413 --> 00:05:51.794
You mentioned Ensign Gay.

00:05:51.875 --> 00:05:52.796
Please describe.

00:05:53.897 --> 00:06:02.205
Well, Ensign Gay came by to tell us about the Battle of Midway, and he got out of

00:06:03.721 --> 00:06:08.267
and he got seniors lined up and he gave them stripes.

00:06:09.929 --> 00:06:21.405
And so he let everybody know that the senior Aggies were always senior to those that they left behind.

00:06:22.767 --> 00:06:27.894
And so I guess we all gained respect for our seniors.

00:06:27.914 --> 00:06:30.117
Now he had been shot down

00:06:30.417 --> 00:06:33.084
during the battle, hadn't he, and had been picked up.

00:06:33.204 --> 00:06:33.885
Yes, picked up.

00:06:35.048 --> 00:06:35.910
And he was an Aggie.

00:06:36.331 --> 00:06:36.793
Yes, sir.

00:06:37.093 --> 00:06:39.579
He was a member of Sea Battery Coast Guard Territory.

00:06:41.143 --> 00:06:45.574
Were there other notable visitors during your student days to the campus?

00:06:46.786 --> 00:06:48.889
Well I just remember him primarily.

00:06:51.673 --> 00:06:54.456
Was We've Never Been Licked, that was filmed after you?

00:06:54.677 --> 00:06:55.157
No, no.

00:06:55.538 --> 00:06:55.838
Is that?

00:06:56.619 --> 00:07:02.928
I had to walk back and forth and across in front of this camera sixteen times to get myself in there one time.

00:07:03.889 --> 00:07:05.391
About two seconds worth.

00:07:07.374 --> 00:07:09.316
And how did you get to be one of those?

00:07:10.037 --> 00:07:10.698
I just did it.

00:07:10.918 --> 00:07:14.363
Oh, oh.

00:07:15.423 --> 00:07:16.885
What's the other gal's name?

00:07:22.271 --> 00:07:24.694
Who were the boys?

00:07:25.775 --> 00:07:26.116
Ains?

00:07:28.018 --> 00:07:29.019
Was it Robert Mitchum?

00:07:29.720 --> 00:07:31.342
I think Robert Mitchum was one of them.

00:07:32.183 --> 00:07:33.444
How long was the crew here?

00:07:33.544 --> 00:07:34.746
Was it a good while?

00:07:35.507 --> 00:07:36.468
Several months.

00:07:37.069 --> 00:07:40.873
Did you all attempt any kind of good bull stunts or jokes?

00:07:42.963 --> 00:07:45.427
I don't think so.

00:07:46.148 --> 00:07:47.451
I don't recall that we did.

00:07:47.471 --> 00:07:50.396
Do you remember when you first saw the movie?

00:07:51.237 --> 00:07:51.718
Yep.

00:07:51.738 --> 00:07:51.978
Where?

00:07:53.260 --> 00:07:59.591
Well, I first saw it, I think I first saw it here.

00:07:59.611 --> 00:08:06.743
And of course I've always, I've had a copy ever since.

00:08:07.820 --> 00:08:09.162
Arthur O'Driscoll.

00:08:09.182 --> 00:08:12.287
Did you all make any noise when you saw it?

00:08:12.607 --> 00:08:13.248
Oh, sure.

00:08:15.392 --> 00:08:16.994
Yee-haw, you know.

00:08:17.014 --> 00:08:23.705
Aggies were always yelling, football games or rodeos or whatever.

00:08:24.406 --> 00:08:25.948
All right, some of the traditions.

00:08:28.071 --> 00:08:30.755
Do you remember first going to Silver Taps?

00:08:31.076 --> 00:08:35.042
What impression did it make when you first went?

00:08:35.528 --> 00:08:42.476
Well, that was a very serious thing, and we'd lost a life or several.

00:08:44.178 --> 00:08:48.884
And it was very impressive, because all the lights went out all over campus.

00:08:50.266 --> 00:08:53.650
And we would then have silver taps.

00:08:53.770 --> 00:09:00.658
And in the darkness, you contemplate life and the future.

00:09:01.668 --> 00:09:03.592
I think we were very serious-minded people.

00:09:03.832 --> 00:09:07.960
Did anybody ever attempt any jokes or pranks during silver taps?

00:09:07.980 --> 00:09:08.982
I don't think so.

00:09:09.203 --> 00:09:10.405
I haven't ever gotten.

00:09:12.369 --> 00:09:16.837
Then what about midnight yell practice?

00:09:16.857 --> 00:09:17.719
Where was it held?

00:09:19.184 --> 00:09:20.987
YMCA?

00:09:21.527 --> 00:09:22.028
Where else?

00:09:22.469 --> 00:09:23.730
Was it held at midnight?

00:09:24.832 --> 00:09:26.154
Right before midnight.

00:09:26.174 --> 00:09:26.434
Okay.

00:09:27.676 --> 00:09:31.141
And what kind of goofy things did y'all do during Yale practice?

00:09:32.062 --> 00:09:32.663
Oh, Lordy.

00:09:32.883 --> 00:09:34.125
What kind of goofy things?

00:09:37.249 --> 00:09:39.553
I don't think we were doing a lot of goofy things.

00:09:39.653 --> 00:09:41.535
It was all very serious.

00:09:44.279 --> 00:09:48.465
Do you remember going to Muster before World War II?

00:09:49.542 --> 00:09:54.248
Did you go to, do you remember going to Muster while you were a student?

00:09:54.268 --> 00:09:54.489
No.

00:09:55.911 --> 00:09:56.111
All right.

00:09:56.131 --> 00:10:00.517
Almost no one has remembered Muster until after World War II.

00:10:01.478 --> 00:10:07.526
Well, I guess it might be the first Muster that I went to was in 1950.

00:10:10.210 --> 00:10:11.351
Fort Knox, Kentucky.

00:10:14.115 --> 00:10:14.976
I believe that's right.

00:10:15.937 --> 00:10:17.119
Your senior ring.

00:10:18.365 --> 00:10:18.986
Where'd you get it?

00:10:19.046 --> 00:10:19.787
Where'd you pick it up?

00:10:23.672 --> 00:10:24.173
Oh, my.

00:10:24.333 --> 00:10:25.555
Where did I pick it up?

00:10:25.575 --> 00:10:26.756
I think it was MSC.

00:10:27.137 --> 00:10:27.798
No, no.

00:10:28.499 --> 00:10:29.580
MSC wasn't built yet.

00:10:29.600 --> 00:10:30.601
Oh, that's right.

00:10:31.382 --> 00:10:32.524
I guess it was an old bookstore.

00:10:33.045 --> 00:10:34.807
Do you remember what it cost?

00:10:35.748 --> 00:10:37.791
Something like $45.

00:10:38.530 --> 00:10:43.701
And now it's $350 minimum.

00:10:43.721 --> 00:10:46.487
And how did you feel when you put that ring on?

00:10:46.968 --> 00:10:48.632
Oh I was most pleased.

00:10:49.594 --> 00:10:57.130
My girlfriend put a diamond in mine.

00:10:57.785 --> 00:11:00.588
That made me really love that gal.

00:11:01.769 --> 00:11:09.897
Do you have any ring stories where you're somewhere on the other side of the world and somebody sees it or you lost it and somebody found it?

00:11:10.057 --> 00:11:11.339
Any good Aggie ring stories?

00:11:12.099 --> 00:11:27.555
The only one that I recall is on this bus coming from Sarajevo, Yugoslavia, to the coast in Yugoslavia.

00:11:29.240 --> 00:11:40.161
from Dallas, he's an architect, Hugo I think we called him, saw my ring and we became great friends there and we enjoyed the rest of the trip.

00:11:40.381 --> 00:11:41.403
Was that during the war?

00:11:41.523 --> 00:11:42.165
No, no.

00:11:42.305 --> 00:11:44.249
Oh, after the war.

00:11:44.469 --> 00:11:45.291
Did you ever lose it?

00:11:45.791 --> 00:11:46.513
Never.

00:11:46.533 --> 00:11:48.717
Well, I had one stolen from me.

00:11:49.658 --> 00:11:54.524
got another one and then for a little while I had two rings.

00:11:55.405 --> 00:12:07.599
And then I was skinning a catfish out at Camp Creek and the big ring was too big and I was skinning, throwing the skin out into the water and there went my ring.

00:12:08.980 --> 00:12:15.548
And I paid $150 to get a guy with

00:12:17.823 --> 00:12:25.754
Like they dredge channels.

00:12:25.774 --> 00:12:26.495
What do you do then?

00:12:28.217 --> 00:12:31.141
Well, we dredged for about four hours.

00:12:31.161 --> 00:12:32.283
But he didn't find it.

00:12:32.323 --> 00:12:33.164
Never did find it.

00:12:33.705 --> 00:12:43.197
I also had a metal detector from the nautical institute here, Mr. Sam Bass.

00:12:43.217 --> 00:12:43.858
George Bass.

00:12:43.878 --> 00:12:44.499
George Bass.

00:12:45.501 --> 00:12:47.323
Why are Aggie rings so treasured?

00:12:49.008 --> 00:12:50.289
Because they're recognizable.

00:12:51.651 --> 00:12:53.132
Because they mean a lot.

00:12:53.372 --> 00:12:56.195
I mean, you worked four years to get that thing.

00:12:56.255 --> 00:12:57.977
All right, your senior boots.

00:12:59.118 --> 00:12:59.919
I still got mine.

00:13:00.139 --> 00:13:00.720
Where'd you get them?

00:13:01.561 --> 00:13:02.121
Lucchese.

00:13:03.703 --> 00:13:04.464
San Antonio.

00:13:04.624 --> 00:13:12.192
And I keep talking about getting them filled with concrete and using them as door stops, but so far I haven't done that.

00:13:12.312 --> 00:13:13.473
Do you remember what they cost?

00:13:14.914 --> 00:13:15.655
Oh, Lordy.

00:13:16.095 --> 00:13:17.597
Was that like $50?

00:13:19.687 --> 00:13:22.792
I think they were more like $75.

00:13:24.815 --> 00:13:32.246
When you went through, did you all have final review when you were a junior?

00:13:34.109 --> 00:13:34.930
Yeah, I believe we did.

00:13:35.892 --> 00:13:36.433
Sure did.

00:13:36.453 --> 00:13:39.297
And you put on those boots for the first time publicly.

00:13:39.337 --> 00:13:40.058
How did you feel?

00:13:40.860 --> 00:13:41.541
Felt great.

00:13:42.722 --> 00:13:44.445
Felt real great.

00:13:44.847 --> 00:13:49.493
step out in front of that outfit and call commands.

00:13:49.834 --> 00:13:50.895
And that was really great.

00:13:50.935 --> 00:13:52.817
Were you accompanying commander, your senior?

00:13:52.838 --> 00:13:53.478
A battery commander.

00:13:53.919 --> 00:13:54.620
Battery commander.

00:13:55.601 --> 00:13:58.645
I haven't had anybody tell.

00:13:58.986 --> 00:14:04.453
What are the responsibilities of being the commander?

00:14:06.255 --> 00:14:08.618
Well, to try to get everybody to get along.

00:14:08.718 --> 00:14:12.964
And they don't always get along.

00:14:14.176 --> 00:14:18.305
Oh, Jack Andrews caused me a little trouble at one time.

00:14:19.307 --> 00:14:22.173
But we got it taken care of out behind the dorm.

00:14:22.634 --> 00:14:26.762
What were the kinds of situations that gave you the most trouble?

00:14:28.747 --> 00:14:29.468
Smartin' off.

00:14:31.608 --> 00:14:38.778
You know, not lining up or just being a mule head.

00:14:38.818 --> 00:14:44.726
Was the misbehavior more often deliberate than accidental?

00:14:45.628 --> 00:14:49.353
Yes.

00:14:49.373 --> 00:14:53.198
Yeah, that's right.

00:14:53.599 --> 00:14:59.387
What were the joys of being, the satisfactions of being the outfit CO?

00:15:00.380 --> 00:15:13.201
Well to see the younger students progress and grow up and become more responsible in everything they did.

00:15:13.241 --> 00:15:23.839
The fact that I got the best drilled sophomore medal, I was very proud of that.

00:15:25.034 --> 00:15:35.229
Then when you get to be appointed first sergeant, and that means you're going to be battery commander later on, that was very important.

00:15:35.249 --> 00:15:39.055
What was the routine that ended up with your being selected?

00:15:40.597 --> 00:15:41.498
Was there an interview?

00:15:41.518 --> 00:15:43.381
Was there a questionnaire?

00:15:43.842 --> 00:15:49.650
No, it was just a matter of upperclassmen making an evaluation.

00:15:49.731 --> 00:15:51.413
They did it themselves.

00:15:52.034 --> 00:16:02.787
And I, of course, helped select the follow-on battery commander and first sergeant for the guys behind us.

00:16:02.867 --> 00:16:08.133
But we'd just all get together and decide who might be the best qualified.

00:16:08.674 --> 00:16:12.298
As you look back on it, do you think that process was appropriate?

00:16:13.079 --> 00:16:13.840
Absolutely.

00:16:14.933 --> 00:16:34.037
I think the corps helped you to learn to evaluate people and to learn to get along with other people and to learn to organize and to learn to select values.

00:16:34.057 --> 00:16:38.142
I just think it was a great experience.

00:16:38.242 --> 00:16:44.670
How much time did being the CO take?

00:16:44.768 --> 00:16:49.077
Well, I don't know.

00:16:49.217 --> 00:16:55.431
It seemed like to me we always had a greater outfit and we always enjoyed doing what we were doing.

00:16:56.292 --> 00:16:58.257
I'll never forget fish day of course.

00:16:59.700 --> 00:17:01.463
Yeah, describe fish day.

00:17:01.764 --> 00:17:03.688
Oh man, that's when the freshman

00:17:04.563 --> 00:17:15.496
had the opportunity to take on the sophomores or anybody up the line that they wanted to get even with or to get their attention.

00:17:16.737 --> 00:17:31.414
And we had, after I came back in 1970, we had a reunion and we had five

00:17:33.588 --> 00:17:36.572
movies of five different fish days.

00:17:37.893 --> 00:17:41.477
One of them was before I got here, and then the last one through there.

00:17:42.338 --> 00:17:48.185
And we showed those movies in one of our rooms.

00:17:48.265 --> 00:18:02.262
Three of us rented three rooms right alongside of the swimming pool over there at what is now the dorm.

00:18:04.520 --> 00:18:20.858
anyway we had we had drinks in one room we had dresses in i mean our clothes in another room and another room for movies and uh we just had a ball now when in terms of the calendar of the year when was fish day

00:18:21.597 --> 00:18:23.219
It was in the spring.

00:18:23.299 --> 00:18:23.840
In the spring?

00:18:24.060 --> 00:18:24.461
Yeah.

00:18:24.481 --> 00:18:26.123
Was it the same day every year?

00:18:26.744 --> 00:18:26.984
No.

00:18:27.464 --> 00:18:33.973
It was about the same time of the year, sort of when the trees started budding out.

00:18:34.093 --> 00:18:34.894
Was it on a Saturday?

00:18:36.055 --> 00:18:36.756
On a weekend.

00:18:36.896 --> 00:18:37.617
I don't recall.

00:18:37.657 --> 00:18:38.919
I think it was a Saturday.

00:18:40.060 --> 00:18:45.507
We had a beer barrel and we had sandwiches and chips and stuff like that.

00:18:45.608 --> 00:18:49.933
Did the fish pick on the outfit CO?

00:18:50.302 --> 00:18:51.884
They picked on anybody they wanted to.

00:18:52.545 --> 00:18:57.252
And there was not supposed to be any retaliation for any of that.

00:18:57.633 --> 00:19:01.519
When you were a senior, do you remember any pranks played on you?

00:19:02.059 --> 00:19:04.223
Well, they tried to drag me off the top of the hill.

00:19:04.283 --> 00:19:09.090
I'd push them off, and I'd maybe get down in the mud, too.

00:19:11.453 --> 00:19:12.715
Did they steal your footlocker?

00:19:13.268 --> 00:19:14.770
No, I didn't.

00:19:14.790 --> 00:19:14.930
No.

00:19:15.952 --> 00:19:26.666
When I was first sergeant, I talked to some freshmen and told them that they really needed to get involved and do a lot of things.

00:19:26.746 --> 00:19:31.112
And why didn't they haul off some of these sophomores that were causing them some problems?

00:19:32.193 --> 00:19:34.757
And old Jack Smithers got me in there.

00:19:35.217 --> 00:19:36.679
He said, what are you trying to do?

00:19:36.719 --> 00:19:38.922
He was the battery commander at that time.

00:19:39.307 --> 00:19:40.710
I said, you're a first sergeant.

00:19:40.730 --> 00:19:44.517
You're supposed to help keep this outfit in good shape and disciplined.

00:19:45.258 --> 00:19:47.041
And yet you told them to go do that.

00:19:47.823 --> 00:19:50.367
Well, Jack, you know, there just weren't enough going on.

00:19:50.407 --> 00:19:57.481
So we'd do something like that once in a while.

00:19:57.941 --> 00:20:03.171
Describe how you were selected to be an RV member.

00:20:05.378 --> 00:20:06.880
Ross volunteer.

00:20:06.960 --> 00:20:08.001
How was I selected?

00:20:08.201 --> 00:20:21.878
I have no idea how I was selected, except that I was selected and I was initiated in the old, what is now the, where you go and get your pictures.

00:20:21.898 --> 00:20:22.198
Pavilion?

00:20:22.619 --> 00:20:23.800
Yeah, pavilion.

00:20:24.021 --> 00:20:25.362
What was the initiation like?

00:20:25.863 --> 00:20:31.690
Oh, God, swallow oysters on a string and get your tail beat.

00:20:33.577 --> 00:20:35.300
And about how many were in the RVs?

00:20:36.402 --> 00:20:38.286
About 200, I guess.

00:20:38.406 --> 00:20:42.052
And did you have to buy your uniform?

00:20:44.176 --> 00:20:44.737
I think so.

00:20:44.777 --> 00:20:46.821
Because it was the same uniform then as now, wasn't it?

00:20:47.042 --> 00:20:47.522
All white?

00:20:47.903 --> 00:20:48.324
All white.

00:20:49.366 --> 00:20:51.049
Yeah, I'm sure I bought it.

00:20:51.710 --> 00:20:57.120
What were some of the fancy things you and the other RVs did?

00:20:57.455 --> 00:20:59.218
Well, welcome the governor, you know.

00:20:59.238 --> 00:21:00.420
Did you all do that then?

00:21:00.440 --> 00:21:01.041
Oh, sure.

00:21:02.163 --> 00:21:02.964
Papio Daniel?

00:21:03.305 --> 00:21:06.931
No, no, not Papio Daniel.

00:21:09.195 --> 00:21:11.058
I don't recall.

00:21:11.078 --> 00:21:12.340
I just don't really recall.

00:21:13.903 --> 00:21:14.964
I'm trying to remember.

00:21:14.984 --> 00:21:16.146
39 through 43.

00:21:16.226 --> 00:21:23.158
See, he's elected in 38 and 40, and then he runs for the Senate in 42.

00:21:24.809 --> 00:21:29.114
And Lyndon was ahead of him in the primary, and some late returns came in.

00:21:30.296 --> 00:21:33.300
And I think he's followed by Coke Stephenson.

00:21:34.481 --> 00:21:39.127
Well, then it had to be O'Daniel.

00:21:39.147 --> 00:21:42.972
I don't recall Coke Stephenson.

00:21:42.992 --> 00:21:45.455
And who was the commandant in those days?

00:21:47.758 --> 00:21:50.682
George.

00:21:52.923 --> 00:21:53.544
Welty.

00:21:55.165 --> 00:21:56.026
W-E-L-T-Y?

00:21:56.406 --> 00:21:56.867
Uh-huh.

00:21:56.887 --> 00:22:16.284
Welty was the commandant, and he's the guy that gave the nine battery commanders in the Coastal Artillery Corps 20 demerits for calling off Reveille formation the day after fish day.

00:22:18.706 --> 00:22:20.668
We all got called in on the carpet.

00:22:21.138 --> 00:22:27.546
and said, you nine guys are supposed to be running this organization and you're not doing a good job.

00:22:27.586 --> 00:22:30.369
You're calling off direct orders.

00:22:30.730 --> 00:22:32.311
It's all going to go into your record.

00:22:32.352 --> 00:22:35.055
We're going to put it right in your record, your military record.

00:22:35.155 --> 00:22:36.296
It'll ruin your career.

00:22:37.398 --> 00:22:39.440
All that kind of baloney.

00:22:39.480 --> 00:22:46.048
That's when we did have to go out to the bullring as seniors behind the Patrol of Engineering.

00:22:47.412 --> 00:22:50.943
All right, we're getting ready to kind of summarize this now.

00:22:51.987 --> 00:23:00.915
As you look back on all of the years, what were the most important courses, academic courses?

00:23:03.022 --> 00:23:07.946
Of course, you'd ask an engineer, and an engineer will tell you, well, it's all important.

00:23:08.567 --> 00:23:08.627
OK.

00:23:09.228 --> 00:23:16.434
I mean, I even took, Gib Gelchrist asked me to take a special course.

00:23:17.635 --> 00:23:18.956
I had some extra time.

00:23:18.996 --> 00:23:21.859
I had already taken a number of the hours required.

00:23:21.959 --> 00:23:24.741
And he said, why don't you take philosophy?

00:23:26.623 --> 00:23:30.987
And I took a course in philosophy, and I wrote him a paper on,

00:23:31.034 --> 00:23:32.418
philosophy for engineers.

00:23:32.979 --> 00:23:34.623
I told them I thought it was very important.

00:23:35.505 --> 00:23:44.689
That you have to be philosophical, you have to evaluate characters, you have to know what motivates people, and all of that sort of thing.

00:23:46.070 --> 00:23:47.872
Well, I came back in 1970.

00:23:47.992 --> 00:23:50.154
I found that paper in his papers.

00:23:51.435 --> 00:23:52.316
How nice.

00:23:52.336 --> 00:23:54.679
Only I don't have it now.

00:23:54.799 --> 00:23:56.460
Did he teach the course?

00:23:56.480 --> 00:23:57.561
No, no, he did not.

00:23:58.522 --> 00:24:02.586
Describe your impression of him as a person.

00:24:02.807 --> 00:24:05.309
A great man, really a great man.

00:24:06.931 --> 00:24:14.338
He was very calm and deliberate in everything he did.

00:24:15.550 --> 00:24:16.251
What was he?

00:24:16.691 --> 00:24:18.372
Was tall, very tall.

00:24:19.874 --> 00:24:23.377
And always stood up straight as far as I was concerned.

00:24:23.397 --> 00:24:25.218
Now, in your day, he was dean of engineering.

00:24:26.639 --> 00:24:28.281
In my day, he was dean of engineering.

00:24:28.681 --> 00:24:30.783
Fred Benson was dean of engineering when I came back.

00:24:30.803 --> 00:24:35.187
Yeah, but Gilchrist had not yet become president.

00:24:37.849 --> 00:24:40.031
I don't know.

00:24:40.631 --> 00:24:42.653
And did you students speak?

00:24:42.953 --> 00:24:44.815
Did you all see him much?

00:24:46.735 --> 00:24:47.776
Say hello to him.

00:24:48.457 --> 00:24:50.740
Every time we'd see him, we'd say hello to him.

00:24:51.060 --> 00:24:52.101
He lived on the campus.

00:24:52.482 --> 00:24:53.443
Yeah, he did.

00:24:54.604 --> 00:24:55.746
A great guy.

00:24:56.406 --> 00:24:58.068
So you all had a high respect for him.

00:24:58.088 --> 00:24:58.749
High respect.

00:24:58.769 --> 00:24:59.951
Who was the president then?

00:25:00.331 --> 00:25:00.792
Do you remember?

00:25:02.514 --> 00:25:03.234
Because I don't know.

00:25:03.254 --> 00:25:03.775
Walton, I guess.

00:25:03.795 --> 00:25:05.037
Walton.

00:25:05.057 --> 00:25:05.437
It was Walton.

00:25:05.457 --> 00:25:06.398
Didn't see much of him.

00:25:06.879 --> 00:25:08.581
No.

00:25:10.103 --> 00:25:14.768
In terms of the courses, were there some that were really hard?

00:25:17.195 --> 00:25:17.676
English.

00:25:22.181 --> 00:25:25.625
I don't recall any of them that were really hard, but you had to stick with it.

00:25:25.765 --> 00:25:31.272
You had to study and you had to study and study and study to stay up.

00:25:31.653 --> 00:25:34.336
In general, was the grading system fair and appropriate?

00:25:34.596 --> 00:25:36.078
As far as I was concerned, it was.

00:25:36.178 --> 00:25:38.101
Were there any easy courses you remember?

00:25:40.884 --> 00:25:42.166
No.

00:25:42.306 --> 00:25:46.611
I think if you stay with a course and you study all the time,

00:25:47.452 --> 00:25:49.614
And keep up, don't get too far behind.

00:25:49.634 --> 00:25:54.419
The course becomes easier as you learn and progress.

00:25:54.619 --> 00:25:57.742
But there weren't any that were supposed to be giveaways to anybody?

00:25:57.863 --> 00:25:59.504
I don't think any of them were giveaways.

00:26:02.207 --> 00:26:12.177
If they could all be brought back, are there some of the faculty and advisors that you would be particularly wanting to thank?

00:26:13.135 --> 00:26:17.560
John George Hatch Thompson, in particular.

00:26:17.600 --> 00:26:19.181
Roy Wingren.

00:26:21.724 --> 00:26:22.405
There's another one.

00:26:25.328 --> 00:26:27.430
I guess the man taught us thermal.

00:26:28.431 --> 00:26:29.012
Was he a good?

00:26:29.613 --> 00:26:30.554
He was a good professor.

00:26:31.194 --> 00:26:31.455
I see.

00:26:31.475 --> 00:26:32.536
He was Mom, wasn't he?

00:26:32.856 --> 00:26:33.156
Mom.

00:26:34.338 --> 00:26:36.040
Did Wingren have a nickname?

00:26:37.221 --> 00:26:37.942
I don't recall.

00:26:38.142 --> 00:26:38.963
I haven't heard one.

00:26:39.183 --> 00:26:41.185
Alphabet, of course.

00:26:43.139 --> 00:26:49.586
Oh, I'm blank right now.

00:26:49.606 --> 00:26:55.973
And faculty members, were they available if you ever, were they on the campus after class if you wanted to go by and chat with them?

00:26:56.434 --> 00:27:01.119
Whenever you want to go see them, you had to let them know you wanted to come see them and they'd tell you when.

00:27:02.981 --> 00:27:05.704
Okay, final review.

00:27:06.845 --> 00:27:08.387
We're now, you're a senior.

00:27:09.228 --> 00:27:12.071
Was there a final review when you graduated?

00:27:12.091 --> 00:27:12.172
Yes.

00:27:12.832 --> 00:27:15.335
Who came for commencement from your family?

00:27:16.236 --> 00:27:17.098
My whole family.

00:27:18.740 --> 00:27:19.360
My whole family came.

00:27:21.303 --> 00:27:21.963
My girlfriend.

00:27:22.845 --> 00:27:25.408
And this is, when did you graduate?

00:27:26.729 --> 00:27:33.177
We graduated on the 19th of January, 1943.

00:27:35.688 --> 00:27:48.365
And we were inducted into the Army on January the 16th, 1943, and got promoted to corporal right away and came back for graduation.

00:27:49.927 --> 00:27:57.116
Then we left for OCS on the 4th of February.

00:27:59.179 --> 00:28:05.627
We went back to Fort Sam Houston and were issued all our clothes and all of that stuff.

00:28:06.130 --> 00:28:16.147
Got on the train in San Antonio and went through New Orleans and Atlanta, Georgia, and we went to Camp Davis, North Carolina.

00:28:20.274 --> 00:28:23.700
How well did you think at the time you graduated?

00:28:23.680 --> 00:28:27.083
How well did you think A&M had prepared you for the real world?

00:28:30.066 --> 00:28:37.634
Well, I told you that our going to OCS was freshman year all over again, so we were well prepared for that.

00:28:38.474 --> 00:28:39.696
And we were well thought of.

00:28:39.836 --> 00:28:46.442
I think our military supervisors thought the Aggies were great.

00:28:48.024 --> 00:28:50.346
What is it that creates Aggie spirit?

00:28:51.862 --> 00:29:14.545
I think association and continued association, respect for each other and doing things together like Scott Kramer and I going to Houston and getting our Model A on fire and getting picked up by a Prairie View A&M student and coming back and turning him around.

00:29:15.186 --> 00:29:19.050
Are there some events that are an important part of Aggie spirit?

00:29:20.836 --> 00:29:32.806
file reviews, graduation, walking across Goddard Hall and finding a bill for $1.57 for a pane of glass.

00:29:34.109 --> 00:29:37.056
All those sort of things are all built into

00:29:38.335 --> 00:29:41.218
Let's see, and I forgot.

00:29:41.559 --> 00:29:44.863
Describe Bonfire during your student days.

00:29:44.883 --> 00:29:50.970
Oh, we had Bonfire out on Harrington Field and we didn't go out and cut great big trees.

00:29:52.051 --> 00:30:01.542
We'd go get outhouses and we'd go get railroad ties and we'd go get old trees, but we didn't

00:30:01.707 --> 00:30:04.230
forests of trees and that sort of thing.

00:30:04.250 --> 00:30:05.612
It was mostly a trash fire.

00:30:06.273 --> 00:30:08.375
And about how long did you all work on it?

00:30:08.716 --> 00:30:09.657
Two or three weekends?

00:30:11.038 --> 00:30:12.881
Oh, I guess we worked on it two or three weeks.

00:30:13.221 --> 00:30:15.404
OK. Not just weekends.

00:30:16.846 --> 00:30:18.708
And it was something to do.

00:30:19.028 --> 00:30:24.295
It was another opportunity to work with guys.

00:30:25.997 --> 00:30:30.162
What were the attitudes, ideas, habits?

00:30:30.547 --> 00:30:33.751
What philosophy did you learn at A&M that's been important?

00:30:36.915 --> 00:30:39.798
Well, don't get too discouraged about things.

00:30:39.818 --> 00:30:55.697
I mean, look at the positive side of life and set your goals, whatever they might be, and don't look back and cry about your decisions.

00:30:55.858 --> 00:31:00.283
I mean, look forward and do the best you can.

00:31:01.175 --> 00:31:19.217
If you were hired today as a consultant to advise the A&M leadership, what advice would you give them as they try to plan the future success of this institution?
