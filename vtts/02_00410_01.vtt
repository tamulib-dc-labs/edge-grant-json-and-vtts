The saber? No, it's a big knife. It's a saber.

02:41.456 --> 02:44.039
It's from the last war. Oh, from Germany? Germany. 
He has a German sword. His son doesn't have a sword.

02:52.930 --> 02:58.255
But I saw a German sword and he said it was from 
Germany. My two sons were there. They were there.

03:02.139 --> 03:03.761
They were in the war. In 1942. In Germany and in 
Italy. And in Italy. They were in the war. But he was

03:11.225 --> 03:16.493

And he went to the war for three years? Yes, he went 
to the war for three years. There is his portrait

03:42.666 --> 03:45.955
when he was 30 years old. Now he is 92 years old. He is 
going to turn 18 in February. In February he turns

03:50.607 --> 03:52.993
92 years old. I was born on the 9th of this year. I was 
born on the 9th of this year. I was born on the 9th of

03:57.206 --> 03:59.109
this year. I was born on the 9th of this year. I was 
born on the 9th of this year. I was born on the 9th of

04:02.374 --> 04:03.075
this year. I was born on the 9th of this year. I was 
born on the 9th of this year. I was born on the 9th of

04:04.878 --> 04:06.261
this year. I was born on the 9th of this year. I was 
born on the 9th of this year. I was born on the 9th of

04:09.726 --> 04:10.708
this year. I was born on the 9th of this year. I was 
born on the 9th of this year. I was born on the 9th of

04:12.651 --> 04:13.993
this year. I was born on the 9th of this year. I was 
born on the 9th of this year. I was born on the 9th of

04:15.676 --> 04:17.739
this year. I was born on the 9th of this year. I was 
born on the 9th of this year. I was born on I am

04:20.243 --> 04:22.125
satisfied. Since I was born, I have been taken care 
of and they are still taking care of me. Tell us

04:30.133 --> 04:32.395
about the man who was shot in the throat. Tell us 
about the man who was shot in the throat. What was

04:37.040 --> 04:38.921
his name? The man who was shot in the throat? Yes, 
the man who was shot in the throat with the bullet

04:40.543 --> 04:46.169
that you took from him. Oh, I don't remember. What 
was his name? He was suffocating himself with the

04:50.129 --> 04:53.958
blood. He was suffocating himself. So he sucked 
the hole. I bit him like this and he hit me. And the

05:02.539 --> 05:03.803
blood clot came out. I don't remember what the 
man's name was. Yes. Oh, that's bad. He said it was

05:10.780 --> 05:11.741
bad. He said he had blood clots and he was burning. 
So he pricked the hole so that the blood would come

05:14.083 --> 05:18.968
out, the blood clots. And then the man could cough 
and other men came and took him away. Much later he

05:23.813 --> 05:25.455
saw him. He said, Medina, Medina, I am me. And he 
lived? He lived. He was cured. He lived, right? He

05:35.686 --> 05:37.027
didn't die, he lived. No, he didn't die. Then they 
talked to him and he looked at me and said, oh,

05:38.003 --> 05:44.392
Medina. He said, you healed me. I said, no, the 
others saw that... Did you know what the cause of

05:47.016 --> 05:53.385
the war was? What was it that they fought for? Why 
did they fight? It was the Carrancitas

05:56.670 --> 06:01.176
government. Carrancistas. Carrancistas. Dice 
que el gobierno eran los federales y los civiles

06:03.159 --> 06:08.767
eran ellos, los civiles. Entonces los civiles se 
peleaban con el gobierno federal porque el

06:09.047 --> 06:16.437
gobierno federal no les ayudaba a los pobres. Ni 
ponía buenos precios del trabajo, ni buenos

06:16.738 --> 06:23.287
trabajos, sino que el gobierno tenía todo 
controlado. Y entonces dice que si usted tenía...

06:27.802 --> 06:38.817
He had a house here, and he had a son, and his son made 
a mistake, so his son was sent, they cut his hair and

06:27.802 --> 06:38.817
sent him as a slave to serve the government by 
force. Also the women, if not the beautiful women,

06:39.518 --> 06:51.795
they didn't want to go with the men, so the 
government sent them to take him to the husband, to

06:39.518 --> 06:51.795
take him and leave him to the woman. So the 
civilians saw that the government was taking a lot

06:54.565 --> 06:56.610
of power, a lot of power. So they said, no, we're 
going to fight the government to teach them that we

06:56.931 --> 07:03.428
want equality. And that's why the war broke out, 
because they said they paid, how much did they pay

07:03.548 --> 07:10.566
you a day? The ones who paid the most were 2 reales. 
They paid 25 cents. They paid 18 cents. 18 cents and

07:20.110 --> 07:22.252
20 cents. For work in the fields, in the 
agriculture, where there were shepherds taking

07:22.312 --> 07:29.759
care of the flocks and everything. That was what 
they paid, 18 cents all day. They said they had a lot

07:34.043 --> 07:38.207
of family, they couldn't live with 25 cents. They 
couldn't live. But if you went and complained to

07:39.848 --> 07:41.970
them, He would grab something and hit him. And if he 
didn't, he would be sent to be stripped of all his

07:44.793 --> 07:56.186
hair and put on the chaco, or whatever it's called, 
the iron hat, and serve the government by force.

07:56.926 --> 07:59.409
And then those soldiers would come to hurt the 
civilians. They would come. And then the

08:01.331 --> 08:07.418
civilians would say, no, we are going to fight the 
government until they give us We want a democratic

08:07.398 --> 08:16.673
government, a democracy, equality for all 
people. That's what he has said many times. And

08:21.681 --> 08:27.430
then, how did he meet General Cardenas? What was 
his name? Alberto Cardenas. You fought against

08:34.921 --> 08:39.555
the Carrancistas. Carrancistas were from the 
government, and Alberto Huerta was a general. But

08:46.278 --> 08:50.644
he was against the Guest. They were the same ones. 
That one was called Alberto Huerta? Alberto

08:56.972 --> 08:57.733
Carrera. Carrera, Carrera. And Pancho Carrera, 
they were two brothers. They were two brothers who

09:01.377 --> 09:08.587
ran, they were civilians, but they got together a 
lot of men and said, let's fight the government.

09:08.607 --> 09:15.255
And they took away their guns, they took 
everything away, and they fought the same

09:08.607 --> 09:15.255
government until... They were able to conquer it. 
I have my father. He was also with the general. The

09:22.618 --> 09:28.970
story goes that General Alberto González... In 
which part of Mexico? In the same place where my

09:31.295 --> 09:35.262
father fought. Bustamante? He

09:35.823 --> 09:52.262
lives

09:35.823 --> 09:52.262
in

09:35.823 --> 09:52.262
the state of Oklahoma. He got it. He was a... 
Teniente,

09:57.608 --> 10:04.539
like a lieutenant. But he was for Pancho Villa. He 
was a villista. Yeah, he was a villista, my papa.

10:09.186 --> 10:16.697
And every time we deal with talking like that, he 
said, I'm a soldier from Villa. And he was a

10:16.677 --> 10:19.120
villista. He revealed the same story. The same 
story. But a carrancista. A carrancista and a

10:22.945 --> 10:24.687
villista. But they were against the government. 
Yes. Against the government. In the first days,

10:30.574 --> 10:34.439
Villa and Carranza were together. Until later, 
they persecuted Villa because Villa did a lot of

10:34.519 --> 10:40.766
bad things afterwards. Yes. There were a lot of... 
But the people of his father were... It was the

10:46.293 --> 10:52.721
state of Coahuila. I was born over there. I was born 
in the state of Coahuila. There were many men who

10:56.946 --> 11:01.150
brought women with them. And they gave us the order 
to walk from one place to another on the trains. And

11:08.146 --> 11:12.673
they had little boys and girls. When did the war 
end? When did the trains end? When they took over

11:16.860 --> 11:19.304
the village. The general who was in charge of the 
government.

11:29.421 --> 11:32.085
I don't remember his name. So... My father met the 
famous Felipe Angeles. My father knew him. My

11:43.813 --> 11:46.356
father knew him. He said that he would put his eye 
like this and he would throw this bullet into the

11:47.037 --> 11:53.984
cannon. My father says that he was a good shooter. 
But they say that they fought and fought and

11:57.387 --> 12:05.196
fought, but then all the federal troops got on a 
train. They were the only ones who had trains, they

12:05.536 --> 12:09.540
didn't have any. But someone said, now that 
everyone is coming on the train, we're going to

12:09.520 --> 12:16.370
release a crazy machine. And it's a cannon, right? 
A canyon, what you call a canyon. That's where the

12:19.896 --> 12:21.599
two trains collapsed. He talks. Tell him how the 
women were doing. Yes. How what? How the women were

12:28.149 --> 12:30.993
dead. No, not dead. The children. The children, I 
mean the children. They were under the trains.

12:37.904 --> 12:44.472
Hacían unas cunas grandes, mira, y ahí tío estuvo. 
Under the train they made a cradle and then the

12:44.840 --> 12:51.488
women with the babies got in there. And the trains 
full of horses. The horses up and the women stuck

12:53.951 --> 12:56.915
down. Inside the wagons and all the soldiers up. 
And the soldiers straight up. The horses in the

13:05.566 --> 13:08.890
middle and the women straight down from the train. 
All over,

13:08.870 --> 13:25.107
crawling.

13:25.087 --> 13:26.829
Protected. Protected. They wanted her mama, but 
her mama was dead. They said it was a terrible

13:31.554 --> 13:32.855
death. They said any word, any word in any language 
is bad. He saw all that. ¿Qué pasó con los niños?

13:40.203 --> 13:44.128
Dice que todo el gobierno los recogió y los puso en 
un lugar para que los crean. Todos los quitaron.

13:47.031 --> 13:50.875
Hay donde yo anduve a Pachihuahua. Chihuahua. 
Yes, Chihuahua. The orphanage. The orphanage in

13:53.245 --> 13:55.288
Chihuahua. That's where they sent the children. 
And a lot of injured people, too, who were injured.

14:00.013 --> 14:01.875
They took them to Chihuahua. They sent them there. 
Yes. There was nothing there. I remember that the

14:04.017 --> 14:09.743
forces were taking care of everything. And, oh, 
what to see. There were times when you didn't sleep

14:11.785 --> 14:14.428
at all. All night I didn't sleep. Nor did I eat. 
Because there was nothing to eat. But they shoot

14:18.445 --> 14:28.772
all night, once against each other, once against 
each other. They don't know how many they killed.

14:31.159 --> 14:32.643
But it wasn't that war. They say it was a terrible 
war. And he says that all wars are the same. The most

14:38.992 --> 14:45.379
advantageous now is when you get a grenade and 
boom, it's uglier. He says the most advantageous

14:45.399 --> 14:53.848
war now is uglier because he says that the men would 
fight each other to kill each other. And he says

14:54.188 --> 14:57.011
that now they throw one and kill many. In masses. In 
masses, yes. They kill many. He says that a war is

15:01.395 --> 15:02.897
ugly. Yes, he said he was very happy. But he didn't, 
because he said he was 92 years old and he was

15:07.186 --> 15:13.259
married to his grandmother. He only had three 
months left to be 64 years married to his

15:13.640 --> 15:18.289
grandmother, to his wife. I thought all the time, 
to put a portrait in the press, you know, and to be

15:23.920 --> 15:33.536
able to tell people that this man has seen things. 
Yes. And well, and then that, but it doesn't seem

15:33.917 --> 15:42.351
like anyone had listened to me, and I think, at 
least to publish it, to say that he knows all these

15:33.917 --> 15:42.351
things. Yes. He knows because he walked in those 
mountains. Yes. He had experience. He had

15:47.219 --> 15:48.201
experience, yes. He says that boy was shot and the 
bullet went through his body. The blood, he says, I

15:54.912 --> 15:58.358
have tasted the blood. The blood is like salty. 
Salty. Salty. Salty blood. Well, in which states

16:04.268 --> 16:08.754
were you during the war? In which states of Mexico? 
Where was I in Mexico? In which town? Did you live in

16:14.261 --> 16:15.322
Bustamante? In Bustamante. Bustamante. No, in a 
ranch in La Joya. A ranch. A ranch in La Joya

16:20.409 --> 16:21.831
Herrera. It's in Bustamante. It's a dark place. 
And on the other side it's still there. And a house

16:27.518 --> 16:30.242
that my father built for me. He says it's a stone 
house that he left there because he ran away and

16:30.661 --> 16:37.071
never came back. Never? Never came back. One of his 
nephews was right that one of his nephews lived in

16:38.633 --> 16:44.422
the house. It's a stone house, but he says he never 
came back. And his children, as they were created

16:47.346 --> 16:53.075
here in the United States, they have never done 
anything to take him. They say, no, dad, let all

16:53.115 --> 16:55.639
that be forgotten. But I tell you that they should 
have taken him to a story so that he could look at his

16:55.990 --> 17:02.436
house and everything. And they say that they don't 
want to bring him sadness because he says that he's

17:02.456 --> 17:11.523
going to see the house that his father built for 
him. And he says that he thinks that his father left

17:11.563 --> 17:16.788
him money in the house, right? Yes. He was a little 
boy, but he says that he looked where his father put

17:16.948 --> 17:19.871
money. Yes. And he's in the house of stone like 
that, right? Yes. And they would look at the fire to

17:25.775 --> 17:30.720
get out of the fire. And they would say, no, I don't 
have any money. But yes. And how many children

17:39.027 --> 17:44.672
did you have then? How many boys did you have? How 
many children did you have? When the war started.

17:52.900 --> 17:55.242
When the war started. They killed me. Didn't you 
have Achille or Palermo? I had Achille. Palemón,

18:03.355 --> 18:07.983
Fernando, Severino, and Julio. And

18:08.203 --> 18:11.829
my husband. My husband was a little baby. He's over 
there at my house. Where did your family live

18:16.457 --> 18:20.082
during the war? Where did my mother-in-law live 
when the war broke out? She stayed at the ranch. At

18:27.334 --> 18:28.737
my house. She stayed at the ranch. My mother died 
and I was left alone, as I am in Victoria. How old

18:36.431 --> 18:39.718
were you when your mother died? 7 years. 7 years or 
14 years? When my father died, I was 7. And when my

18:45.790 --> 18:47.554
father died, my mother died. And I was left alone 
with an aunt of mine here in this side of Victoria,

18:48.023 --> 18:53.311
in El Carmel. In El Carmel. And she took care of me 
over there. She says she was 14 years old when she

18:57.016 --> 18:58.539
left. She was a little orphan who didn't have a 
child. She said she slept with some thugs. Yes. She

19:03.546 --> 19:09.194
said she slept with the thugs in Pinpeg because she 
didn't have a child. In a big house that was there.

19:10.897 --> 19:11.618
It was a very big house. They had to run the marranas 
because it was raining, it was cold, they came and

19:12.172 --> 19:17.588
they got wet. And we also... He says there were 
seven boys. There were a lot of orphans, also

19:20.660 --> 19:25.967
sleeping with the boys. Yes, so that they could get 
warm, because it was hot and cold, and there was no

19:25.987 --> 19:29.152
one. He says he was 14 years old when he was 
deported. He says he got married at the age of 16.

19:36.503 --> 19:36.663
Yes. And then, after he had five children, five 
boys, he went to war. And he says his wife stayed

19:42.351 --> 19:44.094
there. She didn't have a government check or 
anything. Nothing, he just stayed with what his

19:46.377 --> 19:52.738
father gave him or when he could come and leave him 
something. In what way did they live? They didn't

19:55.675 --> 19:57.697
pay anyone. The government wasn't against them. 
No, there was no government. There was no

20:02.142 --> 20:04.404
government. They had no government or nothing. 
They just lived. They lived like, kill and get

20:07.147 --> 20:12.533
killed. It was everything. It was a very ugly 
revolution. brothers with brothers because they

20:18.980 --> 20:23.406
were all the same, Mexicans, they killed each 
other. But the foundation of the war and the reason

20:23.947 --> 20:38.085
was because of that, because they fought for the 
right, that they wanted equality, they didn't

20:23.947 --> 20:38.085
want the people of the government to have enough 
and the poor to have nothing. That's how they

20:38.943 --> 20:42.107
conquered the government. Later on, one of the 
generals called the people and said, Sirs, he

20:42.487 --> 20:50.637
didn't hurt anyone as he said. He said he was 
abhorring the clergy. The respect for other

20:54.161 --> 21:00.008
people's rights is peace. It was written by this 
man that he spoke to. There will be no federalists,

21:04.053 --> 21:07.156
maderistas or carrancistas. We will all be the 
same. And we will all work together and we will have

21:08.557 --> 21:12.160
schools to educate our children. Until all of that 
happened. Then they came back and said, we are

21:14.482 --> 21:18.286
killing each other. And we made the same blood. The 
same blood. Then they realized that those wars

21:22.410 --> 21:26.313
were not good. Then they started... This general 
spoke to the public and told them. Yes. Well, in

21:31.438 --> 21:34.060
what year? He came with his family to the United 
States. What year? What year did he come to the

21:39.910 --> 21:44.477
United States? No, the 18th, no? The 18th. The 18th 
of 1919. Yes, and for what reason? He says, for what

21:51.188 --> 21:52.791
reason did he come? After the war, there was a lot of 
robberies. A lot of robbers. A lot of robbers. A lot

22:02.339 --> 22:06.885
of robbers to steal because there was no 
government. They would come here and take away the

22:06.965 --> 22:10.209
carabiner. If they didn't have money they would 
take everything away. And with the bed,

22:15.670 --> 22:19.419
everything. Everything was taken away. 
Everything. So, once he went to... They went to a

22:26.133 --> 22:34.128
court to judge a man who had a misunderstanding. He 
was a witness. They took him and the lawyer asked

22:35.450 --> 22:39.117
him why he came. He said, I ran away to protect my 
family. He ran away because they didn't let him

22:43.305 --> 22:46.571
sleep. He said he was very sick. The thief came and 
did this to him, he took him out and left him lying on

22:49.910 --> 22:57.591
the floor. During these years, 1917, 1917, 1917, 
1916, 1915, the war started in 1909, right? The war

23:06.265 --> 23:19.280
started in 1909, 1910, 1911, 1912, 1913, 1914, 
1915, 1916, 1917,

23:06.265 --> 23:19.280
and 1918, because 1918 was when he came here. Yes. 
In those years, he says it was a hard time to live. I

23:26.112 --> 23:32.084
have a portrait of my husband when he was 9 months 
old when he came to the United States. Ah, 9 months!

23:33.166 --> 23:36.031
He is 9 months old and my husband is 56 years old. But 
they have never gone to see the place because they

23:39.742 --> 23:42.068
Now that they grew up, they don't believe that. 
They don't believe that this is just an

23:42.208 --> 23:46.198
imagination of their daddy. They don't believe it 
because they've never seen it. But they did see it

23:50.468 --> 23:54.358
because they went to Germany. In 1942, he was in 
Africa. He was told by his mother that he ate a lot of

24:02.189 --> 24:08.398
meat. He ate a lot of animals that were as big as a 
piece of cloth. He was born here. My husband was

24:20.275 --> 24:36.098
born in 1917 and in 1918

24:20.275 --> 24:36.098
they brought the babies here. But they don't 
remember. How did they come here?

24:45.824 --> 24:46.986
Yes. On the train? On the train? To San Antonio. 
They came in a truck that this man was a hooker. He

24:54.996 --> 24:58.701
brought people to work and they brought them to San 
Antonio. They took the train and got off in Hearn,

24:59.002 --> 25:05.270
in the little depot over there. Yes, we got off 
there. We took the train from there. From Laredo.

25:13.206 --> 25:13.767
From Laredo. From Laredo. They took a train. They 
took a train that was carrying people from the

25:18.533 --> 25:23.619
smugglers, hidden. He says they came hidden. Yes. 
In the train. The train was carrying these hidden

25:26.242 --> 25:28.185
people. They brought them here. Yes. His family 
too. His family too. No, in trucks. In trucks. In

25:32.570 --> 25:33.331
trucks. In trucks they brought them to the train. 
And the train brought them here. And there were a

25:37.736 --> 25:39.118
lot of people there. where they helped those who 
came. It is said that the American government

25:42.739 --> 25:49.548
helped those who were in the war. It is said that 
there were those who helped them and they

25:49.808 --> 25:56.817
transported them to places they needed. So he came 
here to live in Huylac. He was the first to arrive

26:00.081 --> 26:05.909
there and he built his house there. How many years 
did he live in Huylac working? 47 years in

26:09.845 --> 26:17.192
agriculture.

26:19.434 --> 26:26.421
From 1918 to 1947

26:19.434 --> 26:26.421
in Huila. From 1947 to 1973 here. From there to 
here, this house. From Mexico they brought it in a

26:35.049 --> 26:38.012
truck, in a train. No, hiding.

26:49.123 --> 26:51.165
Blackmail. What you call not blackmail, but this 
was somebody that refugees. Refugees. Refugees,

27:00.134 --> 27:02.416
people that help the other people get to better 
places. I wondered if they walked at all from

27:02.896 --> 27:06.700
Bustamante. How did you manage to get from 
Bustamante to Laredo? Did you walk? No, no, we

27:11.860 --> 27:15.146
walked. The guys were sick and everything. A 
donkey was carrying a donkey walking. They took a

27:24.521 --> 27:27.125
long time to get over there. How long? How long did 
it take to get there? No, 18 days. 18 days? Quite a

27:32.667 --> 27:33.848
few days. But they walked for 20 hours. It is said 
that they walked and stood up and made firewood and

27:35.390 --> 27:42.017
heated what little they brought. Then another day 
they left. 18 days from Bustamante to Laredo. Yes.

27:46.061 --> 27:47.262
No more, no more. It is said that there are not many. 
Many people. And many died here. And many who

27:52.288 --> 27:54.550
managed to go back. Yes. And I no longer, I no 
longer, I no longer went. A friend of mine told me,

27:59.275 --> 28:01.037
look Melina, My brother Ignacio. He said, they're 
taking her away. I said, no. He said, my wife is

28:06.353 --> 28:07.977
here, my wife is here. No, he said, I swear 
they're... The men were waiting for her there, the

28:10.943 --> 28:14.291
men who were trying to kill her. I swear they're all 
stealing there. They were beating the families,

28:16.542 --> 28:22.289
the people, the boys, the girls. They took them 
away. They said it was an evil disorder. They had

28:26.094 --> 28:27.836
their little children. They looked at America and 
said, let's go. Yes, there were a lot of them in

28:32.482 --> 28:36.908
other parts. I think you know Mr. Sittek, here in 
the court? A.B. Siptak, he was the Sextant

28:41.492 --> 28:44.998
Collector for a long time. Well, he has receipts 
from him. He was 18 years old in 1918. We entered the

28:50.246 --> 28:55.555
court and he looked at my wife and everyone and 
said, this is my boys, he said. Because he was the

28:56.116 --> 29:03.087
secretary of the bigs, of the bigs, of the rich men, 
of the seals. that you call the Seals. They own all

29:04.371 --> 29:07.396
the Frank Seals and all of them. Hombre ricos de 
aquí? Hombre ricos de aquí de Huila. Oh, Huila. De

29:11.482 --> 29:12.403
Huila. Seals. Ellos eran, Frank Seals y todos 
ellos, los Seals, eran hombres ricos. They own all

29:18.492 --> 29:20.215
the part of the... Well, when they came from 
Mexico, they came and built their house with

29:20.195 --> 29:27.405
sieves. They all died. Mr. Siptec was the 
secretary because they had a store, and he was the

29:29.267 --> 29:35.595
clerk and secretary. And he still has all the 
receipts of the stores that Mr. Siptec built. We

29:42.132 --> 29:52.389
took them to the court because my husband wanted to 
be an American citizen because he didn't have

29:42.132 --> 29:52.389
papers. He went to school in Wheelock and had his 
report card. We went to the court in Franklin to get

29:58.740 --> 30:06.132
it out and it had a lot of cobwebs and I wanted them to 
give it to me. We can photograph it and give it to

30:06.112 --> 30:23.682
you, but we can't give you the

30:06.112 --> 30:23.682
real one.

30:23.662 --> 30:32.756
Are the rich in the United States different from 
the rich in Mexico, or are they the same? Are the

30:32.776 --> 30:42.971
rich here like the ones in Mexico, or are the rich 
here better than the ones over there? They are the

30:42.991 --> 30:44.954
same. They are the same? They are the same. Over 
there, they pay more money. This is the money they

30:49.121 --> 30:50.783
get. But they pay, they buy with the money they 
have, they buy from here and so on. Yes, but they say

30:57.878 --> 31:04.323
that you think that the rich here are better than 
the rich there because they pay better here than

30:57.878 --> 31:04.323
there. No, because here the state is worth more. 
Oh, yes. They say that here the state is worth more

31:07.646 --> 31:10.429
than there. They say that here the state was worth 
nothing, it was worth nothing. And now they say

31:14.252 --> 31:19.977
that the money is also worth a lot, there is a lot in 
Mexico. Yes. A lot of money. Here came Pedro

31:21.171 --> 31:22.873
Gérard. Yes. He talked to me. He told me, now Mexico 
is much better than before. Yes, a lot, a lot of

31:30.623 --> 31:34.668
money. Everything is very expensive, but they 
make a lot of money. Yes. Yes, she's from here.

31:46.089 --> 31:46.990
She's from Texas. She's from Texas. And her 
parents are from there? No, they're from here. In

31:51.456 --> 31:52.377
Huntsville. Huntsville. She lives about 50 miles 
from here. No, but her parents are also from here.

32:00.327 --> 32:04.392
Yes, they're also from here.

32:05.502 --> 32:10.328
But I live here with my family, with my husband and 
my children now. She says she lives here in the

32:10.348 --> 32:15.554
school with her husband and his family. Yes. He 
worked here for 10 years in the school. He worked

32:21.620 --> 32:24.644
here for 10 years in the house. In what kind of work? 
When I came from Juilat, from here I worked. In the

32:32.468 --> 32:36.534
maintenance, keeping the yard clean. Yes, he 
worked there. He worked there more than in the

32:37.855 --> 32:40.639
first half of the year. He doesn't look very well. 
Yes, he doesn't look very well. Yes, he doesn't

32:44.064 --> 32:45.887
look very well. Yes, he doesn't look very well. 
Yes, he doesn't look very well. Yes, he doesn't

32:53.117 --> 32:55.540
look very well. And she said, what do you want? And I 
said, no. And then she said, I didn't look. And I

33:02.274 --> 33:03.275
said, no, then no. Because she wanted to work 
there. But I have my citizenship card from school.

33:07.059 --> 33:08.421
And he went to school for five years. And he won his 
citizenship card. He says that if he wants to see

33:11.164 --> 33:15.288
his citizenship card. And if you want to see the 
citizenship card. Oh, yes. Yes. I want it. And he

33:22.267 --> 33:26.693
studied for five years. A Mexican teacher gave him 
the lessons and he learned. And then the

33:30.678 --> 33:33.862
government retired him and gave him his check and 
he lived in his house. Here in the United States?

33:36.766 --> 33:36.906
Yes. But in Mexico? No, he didn't have that 
protection. There in Mexico, the one who is poor is

33:41.992 --> 33:45.497
poor. In these days? In these days also, because 
people on the street ask. They ask for money, they

33:50.363 --> 33:55.851
ask for food, they ask for a little. But here, when 
they come from there and look here, they say, here

33:56.392 --> 34:02.120
we don't see men asking for money or women. Because 
we took a trip to Monterrey last year, and many

34:02.321 --> 34:16.101
elderly women and many elderly men were asking in 
the streets, in the squares, that they wanted

34:02.321 --> 34:16.101
money to heal. They were sick, a lot of them. And 
then I say to my wife, we are better because the

34:18.394 --> 34:26.584
government protects all the elderly. We have a 
place, a house where all the elderly are, and they

34:26.664 --> 34:36.836
don't beg on the streets or anything like that. And 
we like the system because I tell her, it's good

34:37.217 --> 34:41.582
that every Presidente que se sienta, saca unas 
buenas ideas como el March of Dimes y todo eso,

34:41.883 --> 34:51.596
ayuda para la nación, para la nación, mejoras para 
la gente de la nación. Es lo que yo he visto. Yo no soy

34:53.778 --> 35:02.329
ciudadana, pero yo miro eso y les digo yo, es buen 
sistema.

35:03.171 --> 35:10.540
Entre muchos, pónganos monedas y luego se hace 
mucho para ayudarles a aquellos para que no anden

35:03.171 --> 35:10.540
mal. In what year did you leave Mexico? In 1926. 
With your father? Yes, with my family. My family

35:19.324 --> 35:21.470
left her. And for what reason? For the same reason. 
The war? No, the war, it was the war because my

35:26.804 --> 35:31.969
father was also a soldier. But there the soldiers 
would chase them because they wanted the soldiers

35:31.989 --> 35:46.183
who had fought to be soldiers in case they were 
killed, they didn't have to train the soldier. And

35:46.283 --> 35:47.805
they were already married men. They were already 
married men. They were already married men and all

35:49.867 --> 35:53.250
that and they couldn't... Ellos ya no podían andar 
en guerra. Ellos querían vivir aparte con sus

35:56.457 --> 36:02.129
familias. Y nosotros éramos muchos niños 
también. He estado un problema especial para los

36:06.939 --> 36:10.547
villistas. No, my father never said what they had 
in mind, but they wanted all those soldiers to be

36:11.118 --> 36:22.129
together. There was a purpose for another war, so 
they all spread out so that there would be no

36:22.169 --> 36:30.718
soldiers or nationals. That's what he did, he took 
care of me. Did he hunt you? Yes. It's good. It's

36:39.368 --> 36:40.290
very good. Yes, it's good. Yes, it's always good. 
He says that he has all his papers. That's where he

36:46.119 --> 36:48.062
took his citizenship. They had to teach him all of 
that book in English and then in Spanish and

36:48.082 --> 36:52.789
explain it to him and everything. And then my 
husband also, he did his citizenship with his

36:52.889 --> 36:58.017
papers. Yes. And he says that... Mi esposo dice que 
él sabe que es de allá porque le dicen, pero él no

37:00.140 --> 37:09.316
cree porque él nunca vivió, no vivió para 
acordarse cómo estuvo la situación. Mi esposo

37:09.717 --> 37:12.803
dice, yo no soy de allá, yo soy de aquí. Pero él sí es 
un ciudadano para no estar en dudas.

37:19.006 --> 37:35.479
He was

37:19.006 --> 37:35.479
very hardworking.

37:35.459 --> 37:39.004
This one has papers of more than 50 years. More than 
50 years. More than 50 years. It has papers of more

37:42.669 --> 37:44.932
than 50 years. Because all the receipts that Mr. 
Zip-Tac gave her are more than 50 years old. From

37:49.739 --> 37:50.320
1918. And all these letters are from way back. 
That's what he tells me. He tells me that he has many

37:56.269 --> 38:01.476
things from many years ago.

38:04.100 --> 38:05.061
This one. Here is the year. Yes, 37. 37. But there 
are some that are from 1918. Yes. He has them saved.

38:15.739 --> 38:22.247
I don't know where he has them now, but he has them 
saved because I haven't seen them. I give them to my

38:22.327 --> 38:25.630
husband. I give him this. These papers are... I 
don't know if it was for them, but they used to put

38:28.582 --> 38:35.169
them in an antique or someplace. Yes, an antique. 
Or they used to put them in a display, in a bank or

38:38.734 --> 38:45.021
someplace. Let's see, here is a receipt. I don't 
know if this receipt will have the date. No, this

38:50.587 --> 38:53.390
one is 60. He must have more. Fine, these samples. 
Yes, that's what I tell him, that they are kept as a

38:58.435 --> 39:03.140
treasure.

39:05.663 --> 39:09.407
But he says he was in the war, but he says the war is 
bad. The war is bad. He says it destroys the

39:10.468 --> 39:19.598
country, the land, the country, the families, the 
states, the children. And for what reason did they

39:19.797 --> 39:48.049
come here?

39:48.637 --> 39:52.764
I started on Soldado.

39:52.865 --> 39:54.748
How did he happen to become a soldier? Oh, he just 
come overnight, just like my boys were playing

39:54.928 --> 40:00.378
outside when somebody just said, let's go over 
there. And the first day, they start shooting. For

40:03.805 --> 40:05.127
him, there was no training. There was no training. 
They just, the civilians, there was no training.

40:10.917 --> 40:13.641
The government was the one that was training. 
That's the one that reissued. But these ones, they

40:16.365 --> 40:18.008
were civilians. They have to make their way, most 
of the, how they can get out of it. But they didn't

40:25.881 --> 40:26.802
know how. One man, dice él, un hombre decía... The 
general said, we are going to fight, and the man

40:31.178 --> 40:39.193
said, and sir, where do we get the carbines? He 
said, they are going to lend them to us. They will

40:40.655 --> 40:44.542
not lend them, but he was ignorant. He believed 
that the government soldiers were going to lend

40:44.563 --> 40:48.690
them the carbines. They were going to see how many 
people they killed to get the carbines from them.

40:54.247 --> 41:01.123
It was a bloody war because they said they had to 
kill a lot of people to be able to get weapons. And

41:01.143 --> 41:04.271
because the civilians didn't have weapons. The 
government had everything under control. Good

41:08.200 --> 41:10.365
trains, good horses, good everything. Pero luego 
ellos pelearon en contra de él. Y entonces le

41:13.853 --> 41:16.197
ganaron al gobierno. Porque casi toda la gente del 
gobierno se mató en ese, what you call it, what is it

41:16.217 --> 41:24.028
in English? Le hicimos una trampa. They were 
trapped. Trapped.

41:35.143 --> 41:36.185
Y quién es esto? A ver, déjenme.

41:41.446 --> 42:10.585
This is the

41:41.446 --> 42:10.585
Christ

41:41.446 --> 42:10.585
when he was crucified. He was there. He has that 
portrait when he was 30 years old. With his wife?

42:19.248 --> 42:22.092
No, the one above is from 30. The one above, when he 
was 30 years old. What did the man with the rifle do?

42:29.784 --> 42:31.206
What did he do?

42:33.890 --> 42:34.251
The portrait. He had a portrait of his 
brother-in-law dressed as a soldier. In the same

42:43.153 --> 42:44.818
war. He says the portrait is empty. His sister has 
the portrait, but it was his brother-in-law. But I

42:57.121 --> 43:02.289
looked at the portrait in a row, a man with a gun. And 
your brother-in-law was a soldier with you? Yes,

43:04.693 --> 43:06.776
but he was killed. In the war? He was killed. Others 
who fished him, killed him and threw him into a

43:09.280 --> 43:12.464
well. So they saw that that was what they were going 
to do to him if he didn't leave. In what year? In

43:18.713 --> 43:19.334
1918. That's when they killed his 
brother-in-law.

43:25.823 --> 43:26.344
Petronilo. Petronilo. In what year? In 1918. But 
he stayed there. Yes, they had already killed him.

43:36.060 --> 43:36.741
The 18th? Yes, the 18th. They killed him around the 
17th? Yes, around the 17th. Around the 17th, they

43:40.609 --> 43:42.152
say they killed him. So he was the one who thought of 
running away because all the soldiers who were

43:42.213 --> 43:49.027
there wanted to kill him. No, but I heard him say it. 
Well, I don't remember where his mother was. Ah,

43:54.067 --> 43:55.992
yes, Luz. The son of this man lives.

44:02.752 --> 44:06.422
Yes.

44:07.162 --> 44:12.452
And when the soldier was there, he asked 
permission and took him away. Because his father

44:12.532 --> 44:16.078
was killed there in 1917. They killed him with a 
knife. They killed his father and they killed him.

44:21.468 --> 44:25.035
Just like Cuba did with the Cubans. That's why the 
Cubans came here. I know some Cuban men and I've

44:30.141 --> 44:36.628
asked them, well, what made you come here? We've 
been running away from that man Castro. That man,

44:40.273 --> 44:44.798
you don't hear or understand, he's a bad man, an 
iron hand. Who would think of killing 600 men in one

44:44.818 --> 44:47.481
day? Just him, because his head didn't work for 
him. The man was telling us, he was telling us Oh, he

44:53.568 --> 45:00.697
was a minister, he cried and said, why didn't they 
go to the United States and kill him? I said, no, we

45:00.757 --> 45:08.086
can't kill another government from another 
country because then we put the government on top

45:00.757 --> 45:08.086
of those. He said, well, if I went to the United 
States and killed him, why is he the one who is

45:08.106 --> 45:13.433
killing the nation? The man said that many men who 
lived here, their children and their parents,

45:13.413 --> 45:25.114
they would tell them, do you remember that guy who 
lived there? He was killed by the government. All

45:27.217 --> 45:29.161
the men were killed by the government. And so 
that's what made them come here. The Cubans

45:31.064 --> 45:35.813
recognize the same thing as the Mexicans. The same 
thing. That man spoke Cuban, but the Cuban

45:37.416 --> 45:45.011
language and ours is almost the same. The same. I 
realized that. I understood it well. So I

45:49.070 --> 45:52.655
explained to him why he came. He said, they have a 
good deal with Russia. And then Russia is taking

45:57.582 --> 46:01.488
everything away from them. He said he came here to 
the house and they took his washing machine, his

46:01.508 --> 46:07.576
washing machine, and everything. He picked up 
Castro to take to Russia.
