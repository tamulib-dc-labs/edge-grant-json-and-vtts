WEBVTT

00:03.980 --> 00:09.646
Of course, I didn't know him at that time, but 
there's so many people here you mention.

00:13.450 --> 00:24.863
Tiger Teague, we were in the hospital together at 
Temple, McCloskey General Hospital, and I always

00:13.450 --> 00:24.863
liked him very much. He was, Tiger was in a 
wheelchair at that time, and I was in bed and then in

00:24.923 --> 00:33.312
a wheelchair,

00:35.300 --> 00:40.788
He was already politicking, working hard at it. 
And we kept up a relationship, and he used to come to

00:42.210 --> 00:54.008
Laredo once in a while on a junket. There would be a, 
it was a paper company, I've forgotten what the

00:54.108 --> 01:00.177
name of it was, but had bought a ranch right outside 
of Laredo and used it for hunting mostly and mainly

01:00.612 --> 01:11.929
entertaining. And the fellow that ran the, ran 
their lobbying process was a fellow named Ollie

01:12.990 --> 01:20.862
Crawford. Ollie was also a pilot and they had a big 
plane and he'd bring, Well one night he had the

01:29.013 --> 01:34.562
power of the United States House there in my place. 
He had Tiger and Carl Albert and I can't think of

01:34.642 --> 01:46.802
many of them, but a bunch of them in there one night. 
told him i said damn tiger i said i hope nobody bombs

01:47.474 --> 02:07.660
this place with all this but he was a nice fella he 
was a nice and tiger's nickname came from his uh

01:47.474 --> 02:07.660
unwillingness to give up wasn't he a a tireless 
person? Oh, yes, he would. But I can't say where the

02:11.500 --> 02:14.943
nickname came from. To me, it was Tiger D. Yeah, 
because I think it was because he was always like a

02:15.324 --> 02:23.851
little tiger, always going after it giving a 
second effort. He didn't he wouldn't take no for an

02:24.211 --> 02:26.714
answer. All right, back in those months before you 
left, what did you when you were going to have a good

02:26.734 --> 02:35.181
time? What did you and your buddies do? as Aggie 
students? Well, I had a very good friend named Phil

02:41.472 --> 02:47.519
Beckley. Phil was in my outfit. He was a year ahead 
of me. And another fellow named Ray Youngblood

02:54.988 --> 03:04.039
was in the outfit.

03:07.732 --> 03:19.825
We had a lot of fun just going down to Hard Liquors 
and having a little beer and singing a lot. At Hard

03:19.945 --> 03:26.672
Liquors in that era, was there any check on who was 
18 or 21? Was there any age? I never had anybody ask

03:29.275 --> 03:37.283
me and God only knows if you'd see some pictures of 
me at that age, you'd think I was 14. I never had

03:37.786 --> 03:40.210
anybody ask me anything. Did he put up with anybody 
that got bothersome if they drank too much? I never

03:46.079 --> 03:50.085
saw anybody out of line that ordered liquors. I'm 
not saying somebody didn't get a little

03:50.105 --> 03:56.335
boisterous or something like that, but as far as 
really causing any trouble, I never saw it. And

03:56.675 --> 03:58.158
normally you all walked down there? Oh, yes. 
Normally we walked everywhere. And it would seat

04:01.483 --> 04:02.865
about how many?

04:06.912 --> 04:35.822
i don't know but it sure wasn't very big two dozen oh 
yeah something like that i guess and uh what other

04:06.912 --> 04:35.822
what else was available other than things to drink 
well could you get a hamburger or a hot dog you could

04:06.912 --> 04:35.822
uh yeah you'd get a hamburger and uh once in a while 
they play a little dominoes something like that no

04:06.912 --> 04:35.822
dancing no not to mine i don't ever don't remember 
see it any the only dancing we had right Round there

04:36.224 --> 04:47.276
was, we had dances once in a while down at the,

04:36.224 --> 04:47.276
they built this place down near the end of the drill 
field. They called it the Grove or something like

04:47.356 --> 04:51.020
that. Outdoors. Yeah. And dances there, but our 
big dances were always at Sabeasa. Describe those

04:58.127 --> 04:59.449
big dances. Well, they were great really.

05:07.021 --> 05:12.590
The girls would come in, and a few people had dates. 
They'd usually, from TSAW,

05:13.411 --> 05:34.665
the girls would usually be a couple of busloads, 
them come down, and then girls would descend from

05:13.411 --> 05:34.665
everywhere, it seemed like, and we'd usually, 
since there wasn't, oh, there was a couple of

05:13.411 --> 05:34.665
hotels in Bryan,

05:35.945 --> 05:37.608
I've forgotten the names of them. LaSalle. 
LaSalle and then right across the street the

05:38.470 --> 05:42.197
Kentuckian or something like that. And that was 
it. And then a lot of the local people would rent a

05:45.724 --> 05:56.805
room out to a girl or what we'd always do is take one 
dormitory usually and vacate it. the girls would

05:58.102 --> 06:00.785
take over the dormitory. Of course, everybody 
left them notes. But anyway, the dances would be,

06:04.950 --> 06:15.443
they'd really be great, because we'd have good 
bands and have good music. Now, speaking of the

06:16.004 --> 06:27.298
Aggieland, I remember one time we had a band down 
there, I don't remember what it was, but it was

06:16.004 --> 06:27.298
supposed to have been a pretty good band, and there 
was going to be such a crowd, that they had them

06:27.920 --> 06:36.551
playing in the main area and the Aggieland played 
over in another area of the deal. Of Sabeasa? And

06:37.752 --> 06:39.875
let me tell you something. Before long, they 
should have moved them around because everybody

06:40.015 --> 06:48.005
was over dancing to the Aggieland instead of the 
big band. No, they had a great orchestra. And how

06:51.410 --> 06:53.773
did Aggies behave at those dances? Very well.

06:59.493 --> 07:09.945
You

06:59.493 --> 07:09.945
know, I've always, people talk about a bunch of 
rough boys and everything like that. As

07:10.906 --> 07:18.275
long as the occasions called for it, Aggies were 
always perfect gentlemen. They really were. And I

07:20.718 --> 07:25.604
understand the girls loved coming to an Aggie 
dance, that they were treated like queens. Oh,

07:25.624 --> 07:28.487
yeah, because, my God, you know, Well, it was only 
normal. You'd take guys that hadn't been around a

07:31.517 --> 07:47.540
girl in a month or two, and then for the girls to be 
outnumbered at least two and a half to one or three

07:31.517 --> 07:47.540
to one, that was quite a thing, too. I've heard, did 
y'all refer to the Bryan 200? I've heard some

07:52.888 --> 07:56.673
people refer to a select group of Bryan girls. Yes.

08:01.036 --> 08:03.158
There was a few of them. It was,

08:03.979 --> 08:22.200
as I remember, there was only about, there hadn't 
been more, but there was only about four or five

08:03.979 --> 08:22.200
gals that I remember that were from Bryan, and I 
couldn't call their names offhand. If I could, I

08:22.240 --> 08:25.023
wouldn't. But they

08:25.043 --> 08:29.288
used to, used to come out there quite a bit. Johnny 
Lawrence was from Bryan. Johnny was two or three

08:39.009 --> 08:49.022
classes ahead of me, and I'm trying to think who 
else was from Bryan there. Johnny's the only one I

08:49.082 --> 08:53.368
remember offhand, one of the boys. And as we're 
talking about the students then, summarize

08:54.648 --> 09:07.081
generally the basic attitudes of Aggies at the 
time of the beginning of World War I. Not the war,

09:07.701 --> 09:12.026
but where did Aggie students come from? Were they 
liberal, conservative? What were their values?

09:20.414 --> 09:22.917
Well, when I went to A&M, I was I was thinking that 
I'm going to run into

09:23.318 --> 09:33.591
basically agricultural people.

09:36.695 --> 09:45.566
Well, it wasn't to this point that there were a lot 
of them, but there was a lot of boys that were as we'd

09:36.695 --> 09:45.566
have called city boys there, too. A lot of Dallas 
people, a lot of Houston people, and a lot of West

09:46.467 --> 09:52.735
Texas people.

09:58.274 --> 10:08.544
I would say not

09:58.274 --> 10:08.544
about 95% conservative or more, if that's 
possible. There were a few very liberal people,

10:08.564 --> 10:15.611
but not a lot. I mean, it was a, the

10:15.691 --> 10:22.738
majority of the students

10:25.790 --> 10:34.620
Well, the majority of the people in the state of 
Texas at that time had come from families that had

10:25.790 --> 10:34.620
been hard-pressed.

10:38.064 --> 10:54.902
I don't mean they'd been starving, but they'd been 
hard-pressed to make ends meet and maintain the

10:38.064 --> 10:54.902
home values that they wanted and so on and so forth.

10:56.418 --> 11:00.064
You just had an overall attitude like that there. I 
have to lay it on the line and tell you that I,

11:02.487 --> 11:25.362
as far as a

11:02.487 --> 11:25.362
education

11:02.487 --> 11:25.362
book-wise, I didn't get what I went to A&M to get in 
that respect. Not because of the school, but

11:26.607 --> 11:29.410
because of me. But I'm going to tell you that I got 
something at A&M which was an abiding friendship

11:31.172 --> 11:50.893
with some of the greatest people.

11:56.054 --> 12:00.759
How did that develop? Why did it develop? I don't 
know. I guess it's just there was a certain

12:01.740 --> 12:12.271
cohesiveness there, and different people, we 
just gravitated to each other. And

12:12.311 --> 12:20.179
like Ned Bruin, for instance. Ned is a close friend 
of mine. Ned died last year. Dickie

12:28.150 --> 12:43.366
was one of Mr. Heap's boys, Herman Heap. And Minnie 
Bell, she was a nice lady. Let's see, was Fort

12:50.254 --> 12:53.277
Albright and John Lindsay, were they in your? Oh, I 
knew John well. Ford was another year ahead, and I

12:56.399 --> 13:11.258
didn't really, I knew Ford, but you know who, 
people didn't know a freshman much if you're

12:56.399 --> 13:11.258
junior. But I knew John Lindsey quite well. I 
remember when, after the war, I got to know, we, all

13:15.283 --> 13:24.735
of these people, mostly we met at A&M. And we 
established a basis, but we became closer friends

13:26.386 --> 13:34.335
after the war. But that was the bond that kept us all 
together. How does that bond get initiated?

13:50.833 --> 13:52.815
Who was it made the statement? I thought I was going 
to remember that when I heard it. It says,

13:58.576 --> 14:08.408
I can't explain the Aggie spirit.

14:11.792 --> 14:20.022
And

14:11.792 --> 14:20.022
if it has to be explained to you, you don't know what 
it is. I mean, it's just, I don't know what it is. But

14:24.875 --> 14:27.719
this was even more than that. I say more than that. 
What's more than that?

14:34.309 --> 14:43.544
I just developed some ties with people that were as 
strong or stronger than blood ties. And I

14:45.707 --> 14:52.958
wouldn't, you know, we're not getting any 
younger, but I wouldn't take anything for those

14:53.782 --> 14:59.311
those ties that developed and were nurtured over 
the years and so on and so forth. In 1941 and two and

14:59.331 --> 15:10.047
three, in that period, in the student body, were 
there some Protestants and some Catholics and

14:59.331 --> 15:10.047
some Jewish?

15:12.791 --> 15:17.038
There were all kinds.

15:18.638 --> 15:24.707
I'd be guilty if I said I never heard anybody make a 
slighting remark. Sure I did. But generally,

15:26.670 --> 15:42.553
there was not a,

15:26.670 --> 15:42.553
there was no put down because you happened to be a 
Catholic or a Protestant or a Jew or whatever. And

15:43.259 --> 15:46.744
were there Hispanic youngsters, 
Mexican-American? We had some there. It was very,

15:47.926 --> 15:52.292
very small, very small. However, that was 
probably the largest ethnic group other than

15:52.312 --> 15:59.983
Anglo was Hispanic. But even at that time, it was 
quite large. Of course, there were no blacks at

16:02.908 --> 16:05.732
that time. And were you all conscious of each 
other's family wealth? No, that was one of the

16:12.132 --> 16:16.296
great things about A&M. That uniform was a great 
equalizer.

16:24.564 --> 16:39.338
No one, you got to liking a fella because of what he 
was, not because of what he had or what, for the most

16:24.564 --> 16:39.338
part you didn't know what he had.

16:39.824 --> 16:44.371
sure couldn't tell by their clothes because they 
were all wearing the same thing. What were the most

16:44.391 --> 16:48.618
respected student organizations? Band, Ross 
Volunteers, what? Ross Volunteers was always

16:53.807 --> 16:55.910
respected.

16:59.295 --> 17:04.684
The band,

16:59.295 --> 17:04.684
but I would

17:07.482 --> 17:25.493
I think the individual outfits, everybody had a 
certain binding to their individual outfits and

17:07.482 --> 17:25.493
not only that to their, if it wasn't to their 
battery, it was to say the field artillery, the

17:07.482 --> 17:25.493
coast artillery or something like that. Was there 
any outfit that everybody on the campus agreed was

17:25.513 --> 17:33.186
the best or the worst?

17:36.811 --> 17:46.984
It had to be a good outfit with E Battery Field, and 
the reason I say that, they would tell everybody

17:36.811 --> 17:46.984
that. And they were a good outfit. It was a San 
Antonio outfit. Dang near everybody in it was from

17:54.293 --> 17:57.056
San Antonio. They kept it that way, and they had a 
good outfit. Wasn't as good as eye battery, but you

18:02.714 --> 18:04.596
know. There you go.

18:08.822 --> 18:09.362
Let's see. The most prestigious student office 
was what? The individual student.

18:28.507 --> 18:31.050
At the time I was there, I'd say cadet colonel. 
That's what I assumed. And there was a senior class

18:34.909 --> 18:37.873
president. Yes, yes, there were every class had 
their. However, as

18:44.440 --> 19:01.999
I remember,

18:44.440 --> 19:01.999
we gave not much

18:44.440 --> 19:01.999
credence to

19:03.852 --> 19:09.858
freshman class president, sophomore class 
president, so on and so forth. And when it got on

19:09.938 --> 19:16.744
down to senior class president, that's something 
else. The editor of the battalion was, you know,

19:16.764 --> 19:20.267
something. Different things like that. I would 
say the

19:22.369 --> 19:32.138
president of the senior class was a very High 
honor. Head yell leader? Head yell leader. But

19:38.213 --> 19:46.325
not, head yell leader wouldn't look, well, yes, 
but that's not as much as it is today, I don't think.

19:47.246 --> 19:53.616
Were you and your buddies aware of any secret 
fraternities in those days? Yes, sir. I'm not

19:56.820 --> 19:58.683
going to say anything else about that. Okay, all 
right. Most of the people that I have asked about it

20:00.485 --> 20:05.933
indicate that they weren't aware then and aren't 
aware now. And sometimes they smile and sometimes

20:07.335 --> 20:10.580
they don't. Because I have the impression that at 
least one of those organizations goes back maybe

20:11.862 --> 20:19.254
100 years. But I don't know. I'm not. No, I hear you. 
I hear you. Let's see.

20:30.505 --> 20:43.349
The routine of your courses changed in the summer 
of 42 when you all go to a trimester. Right. And so

20:44.532 --> 20:49.100
you just stayed there and started taking 
sophomore courses. That's correct. And the core

20:50.873 --> 20:56.219
activities continued through that summer. 
Correct. Did everything become more serious?

21:07.452 --> 21:07.872
Yes, sir. It did. Because everybody...

21:18.903 --> 21:29.839
I don't want this to sound like nobody wanted to go 
to service, but everybody was as practical as you

21:18.903 --> 21:29.839
could be about something like that. They wanted to 
get as much of the schooling behind them as they

21:32.382 --> 21:35.627
could. And

21:37.930 --> 21:47.003
it was easier to do it as much as you could then. If 
you didn't keep the grades, you were going out

21:48.215 --> 21:56.325
immediately, which we had happened to a lot of 
friends. Now, as it turned out, I tore a bunch of

21:56.445 --> 22:08.580
those guys that went out and then came back and 
became great successes. Well, he had told me about

22:09.281 --> 22:16.770
how his grades were awful, but the service made him 
serious and changed him forever. Did you stay with

22:17.088 --> 22:20.272
your pre-med major? Yes, sir, while I was in 
school. However, I have to give you this however,

22:24.958 --> 22:38.556
my main deal by this time was just to stay in school. 
See, for me, the Korean War is exactly the same. To

22:44.600 --> 22:48.344
put it off, if I could, and at least graduate.

22:55.592 --> 23:05.002
All right, then, when do you leave permanently for 
the active duty?

23:05.042 --> 23:05.843
Let's see.

23:08.860 --> 23:17.453
I'm trying to think when we went out in 43,

23:08.860 --> 23:17.453
I guess it was. In 43, early 43, they sent us, that's 
when they sent us to Fort Sill for a basic training

23:36.232 --> 23:46.184
And we go through a 21-week basic training, and 
then they sent us back to College Station. Now,

23:46.865 --> 23:51.011
we went to Sill. Some boys went to Camp Roberts, 
California. Some to Mineral Wells, to Camp

23:55.176 --> 24:01.283
Walters.

24:04.227 --> 24:05.749
I don't know where else they were. sent possibly 
one other place. And then we all came back to

24:10.667 --> 24:20.778
school, supposedly for a very short time, but we 
didn't know. And we finished

24:22.680 --> 24:34.993
one semester of our junior year. and started the 
second one and that's when they pulled us out and

24:36.863 --> 24:48.475
through which when my group went back to Fort Sill 
and then to Fort Benning. Describe how y'all

24:49.376 --> 24:53.320
learned you were leaving. How much lead time did 
they give you? What did you take? As I remember it,

24:58.926 --> 25:04.812
not very much.

25:06.395 --> 25:13.384
If you want to count the rumors and how many times we 
didn't leave, there's a lot of that. But

25:14.405 --> 25:23.316
when it came down to actual leaving, very little 
lead time. And what did you take with you?

25:27.781 --> 25:30.885
What you could put in an A bag and a B bag. And what did 
you leave here or leave at College Station? I

25:35.572 --> 25:38.498
didn't leave much because I didn't have anything 
there. By this time, it had already become a

25:39.420 --> 25:47.697
foregone

25:39.420 --> 25:47.697
conclusion that we were going. It was just a 
question of when. So no car? No, I had no car by then,

25:51.645 --> 25:54.430
you know. In fact, When I was, when I was there at 
school, we had two parking lots on the campus. They

26:03.856 --> 26:10.304
were both, you know, just open air like, one over by 
what's now the Triple A building over there. There

26:10.364 --> 26:23.179
was one back there that maybe, maybe

26:10.364 --> 26:23.179
you could put 35 cars in it, and then one over behind 
the dorm, 11, which is the band dorm up in that area,

26:24.813 --> 26:38.192
one up there that would have probably held, 
probably held 100 cars if there would have been

26:24.813 --> 26:38.192
enough to fill it, but neither one of them were 
full. And that's all the cars on campus, student

26:38.993 --> 26:44.782
cars on campus. Do you recall your

26:44.802 --> 26:52.693
feelings or the others' feelings as y'all got on 
the train to leave? Well,

26:55.340 --> 27:14.779
I think there was a lot

26:55.340 --> 27:14.779
of put on for show.

27:19.984 --> 27:23.608
I can only really speak for myself, but I think I'm 
speaking for a lot of people, we were very

27:24.365 --> 27:30.375
concerned about what's going to happen. Where are 
we going to go? What's going to happen to us? And so

27:33.901 --> 27:35.343
on and so forth. But nobody's going to come out and 
say these kind of things. You know, that wouldn't,

27:38.809 --> 27:42.895
that wouldn't be the manly thing to do. And we're 
all talking about how we're going to do this and do

27:42.935 --> 27:48.965
that. But Yes, there's a lot of apprehension on 
everybody's part. How did, when you all were at

27:55.752 --> 28:07.489
these brief stops at Fort Sill and so forth, how did 
Aggies compare in their training performance

27:55.752 --> 28:07.489
with students from the other colleges?

28:10.333 --> 28:14.439
This is going to sound very braggadocious, but 
it's the truth. It's the truth. There was no one had

28:15.701 --> 28:18.064
to No one had that kind of training, none. We, at 
Fort Sill, we had non-coms up there that were

28:22.299 --> 28:43.326
practically all inferior in training to what all 
of our group was. Did the commissioned officers

28:43.346 --> 28:48.152
give you all praise and credit?

28:52.971 --> 29:03.405
Well, let's say this, they, they, they knew what 
was going on, but we made, we could make them look

28:52.971 --> 29:03.405
good, or we could make them look awful bad. And I 
think, to tell you the truth, I think the junior

29:04.887 --> 29:16.823
grade officers were a little intimidated by the NM 
boys. All right, and in class were you yet a senior?

29:23.651 --> 29:29.539
No, no, we never, none of our group ever got to be 
seniors. Okay, all right. We were just barely

29:30.981 --> 29:32.443
juniors. So, all right, so you hadn't been through 
final review except as a freshman or sophomore? We

29:41.376 --> 29:46.303
never,

29:41.376 --> 29:46.303
let's see. We went through a final review of sorts 
when we were freshmen because it wasn't a real deal

29:47.633 --> 30:13.557
even then because the seniors our freshman year 
were taken out of school a little bit early. Now

30:14.836 --> 30:18.460
let's see, but you had been to Silver Taps. Yes, and 
that... Describe Silver Taps. The most

30:22.985 --> 30:26.329
impressive ceremony that Texas A&M has. I

30:27.591 --> 30:35.780
can't tell you the depth of feeling I have for 
Silver Taps. The first time that I was ever there, I

30:35.961 --> 30:42.328
just was... It was one of the most moving 
experiences I've ever had.

30:49.902 --> 30:58.011
We all walked to the

30:49.902 --> 30:58.011
academic building, in front of the academic 
building. No sound,

31:00.473 --> 31:05.578
no cigarettes, no nothing. Everybody's just 
standing there. And then you start hearing the

31:12.447 --> 31:16.602
bugles.
