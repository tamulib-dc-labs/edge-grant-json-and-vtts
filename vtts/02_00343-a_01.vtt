00:03.305 --> 00:18.625
As

00:03.305 --> 00:18.625
I understand it, and I haven't checked out weather 
records, but as I understand it, about Friday the

00:03.305 --> 00:18.625
9th of July, it started to rain down that country. 
And it just rained over that weekend, and by Monday

00:19.486 --> 00:29.059
the 12th, they had, they felt they had a situation 
on their hands. So evidently on Monday the 12th and

00:29.562 --> 00:40.740
Tuesday the 13th, they began calling Jarvis 
Miller up here to, well, what can we do? And they set

00:42.342 --> 00:46.629
up that meeting then for Wednesday the 14th. And 
Dudley Smith called several people to see if we

00:48.191 --> 00:54.962
could go down there and meet with this group. And we 
went down on Wednesday in the University Plain,

00:55.921 --> 01:04.970
left here in the rain and flew down in the rain the 
whole way. And when we got down below the clouds at

01:06.731 --> 01:18.443
Corpus, you'd look down at the ground and there 
would be these dark areas that you might mistake

01:06.731 --> 01:18.443
for plowed fields. But as you got lower, you found 
out that they were this stuff right here, this

01:18.743 --> 01:24.949
chocolate brown grain. And there were just 
puddles of water all over the place. So, now as I

01:31.481 --> 01:44.078
understand it too, the rain had kind of slacked off 
on Tuesday, but it started raining again Tuesday

01:31.481 --> 01:44.078
night after this meeting, or maybe they were still 
negotiating over the meeting. But at any rate, it

01:45.601 --> 01:50.127
rained all Tuesday night and apparently all day 
Wednesday. And on Wednesday afternoon, the 14th,

01:50.528 --> 01:56.114
when we were in session down there, it really came 
up good. They had a tornado out west of Robstown.

02:01.520 --> 02:12.511
And there was a field of grain like this that was 
right across the drive there from the center

02:01.520 --> 02:12.511
building that just laid flat between 2 and 3 
o'clock that afternoon. So it was kind of a bad

02:13.512 --> 02:16.896
deal. There were people there from... The 
elevators, the grain exchange, the county

02:20.448 --> 02:30.419
agents, there were a few farmers and just kind of a 
general gathering, obviously. They all were

02:30.439 --> 02:34.083
looking for what was going to happen. And they had 
samples of grain that had come from elevators and

02:35.404 --> 02:49.560
from the grain exchange, and some the county 
agents had taken and they hid them in bags in there,

02:35.404 --> 02:49.560
and they were all labeled by hybrid number and all 
this kind of stuff. And you'd see everything from

02:50.384 --> 02:56.389
grain, of course these were a lot worse looking 
when they were wet. That was one that you might call

02:57.631 --> 03:01.714
that 100% sprouted. And they seemed to pretty well 
have singled out certain hybrids that were

03:03.636 --> 03:11.223
weathering and sprouting worse than others. And 
one apparently that they considered to be a bad one

03:12.344 --> 03:18.990
from the standpoint of standing the weathering 
was use

03:19.831 --> 03:29.662
any name, but I'm pretty sure it was a Pioneer 
8308B. And

03:30.863 --> 03:37.971
everywhere you'd go, they'd mention this one and 
have ever since. But at any rate, they gave us,

03:39.372 --> 03:48.302
let's see, there was Lloyd Rooney and... And 
Miller, not Fred Miller, another Miller out of

03:50.476 --> 03:57.925
Plant Science. Charles Miller. You don't have him 
on this list, do you? No, he's not really working

04:03.712 --> 04:07.937
with the group on it very much. See, what was it, 
Dudley mentioned him, Charles Miller in Plant

04:08.277 --> 04:15.465
Sciences, when fields dry out, what are the 
problems? Right, that's right. And then the boy

04:18.033 --> 04:24.042
from Ag Engineering to talk a little bit about what 
they might do. Richard Withers. Richard Withers.

04:27.426 --> 04:28.668
Is that W-I-T-H-E-R-S? Yes, yes. He's apparently 
new, been on the job four or five months, something

04:31.352 --> 04:36.479
like that. He was simply considering things that 
they might do from the standpoint of their combine

04:37.321 --> 04:45.272
settings and stuff like this. help the situation 
some. Well they gave us about an hour or so to look at

04:47.256 --> 05:07.157
these samples and then we went and ate lunch and 
after lunch we had to get together and make up our

04:47.256 --> 05:07.157
minds what we were going to say at a two o'clock 
press conference they'd called and I bet you there

04:47.256 --> 05:07.157
were 150 people there at that darn thing. All the 
elevator operators in the area came in there and

05:10.632 --> 05:17.961
And we have this kind of a four or five man 
symposium, each one of us made a statement with

05:10.632 --> 05:17.961
regard to our particular area. And well, what 
seemed perfectly obvious that day was that the

05:19.142 --> 05:29.175
first thing it's gonna have to do is get it dried up 
enough where they can get it out of the field. And we

05:29.835 --> 05:33.720
figured that if it had stopped raining right then 
and sun had come out bright and pretty the next day

05:34.156 --> 05:44.286
and it hadn't rained anymore it would be ten days or 
two weeks before they could get in the field to do

05:34.156 --> 05:44.286
anything. And that's about the way it turned out 
actually too. I didn't feel too badly about the

05:49.531 --> 05:56.438
grain if it could be gotten out of the field and if 
they could clean it pretty well. And since that

05:58.420 --> 06:04.146
time we've picked up bits and pieces from here, 
there, and yonder We didn't go down there

06:05.392 --> 06:11.679
authorized to do anything or to make any promises 
to do anything. We just simply were to go down and

06:12.920 --> 06:19.406
offer assessment and hold their hand. And I told 
them, I said, well, I can sympathize with you a

06:19.427 --> 06:29.577
whole lot, but the first thing that's going to 
happen is to get it dried up enough to get it out of

06:19.427 --> 06:29.577
the field and assuming that can be done. I'm quite 
sure that we can feed it because cattle are not

06:30.232 --> 06:41.313
extremely sensitive to mold and probably a lot of 
these things will dry off and probably won't cause

06:30.232 --> 06:41.313
much trouble anyway. But I did say that I thought 
they should be real cautious about sheep and

06:41.333 --> 06:50.670
probably poultry and dairy cattle and perhaps 
pigs. This

06:52.574 --> 07:09.139
was all a thing that I think was in the back of 
everybody's mind, but we've had this sort of thing

06:52.574 --> 07:09.139
before and of course haven't had very much trouble 
with it. Well then O.D. and I and Neville Clark and

07:12.524 --> 07:16.590
Charlie Boyd went down He was in charge of the large 
animal clinic in that hospital. We were down there

07:24.313 --> 07:33.025
on

07:24.313 --> 07:33.025
Monday and Tuesday, the third, second and third. 
And the combines were going, you'd see them going

07:35.028 --> 07:43.540
across the field and they looked like they were 
traveling in a cloud with dust and stuff boiling

07:35.028 --> 07:43.540
out of them. And the grain was being delivered to 
those elevators and feed stores and whatnot and

07:44.802 --> 07:50.909
just had it in great mountains. What percentage 
moisture was it, John? Well, probably everything

07:54.133 --> 07:59.480
from 18, 19 percent down. 35? No, no. It was dried up 
by then pretty well. They could get in there and

08:05.187 --> 08:08.791
combine it and get it out and the dust was flying. 
Every place they were handling the grain, there

08:10.193 --> 08:14.218
was dust and dirt boiling up. And I know there at 
Beeville, it just looked like the dust from that

08:15.481 --> 08:21.086
elevator just coated that whole part of town. You 
know, like a gin in the fall. You know, that dust

08:22.808 --> 08:24.730
blows all over the place. And the man there said 
that about all the grain he was getting was number

08:25.891 --> 08:36.040
four in sample grade. And we asked him if he had any 
market value on it or any market established on it,

08:36.060 --> 08:40.925
and he said no. Really, we're just kind of, The 
farmers own the stuff. I'm just keeping it here for

08:46.263 --> 08:47.665
them. We're waiting for somebody to make an offer. 
Well, at any rate, that day we pretty well decided

08:51.749 --> 08:56.573
that we'd better try to do something with it. We 
still didn't have any authorization from the

08:57.474 --> 09:02.038
director's office to do this, unless O.D. had it, 
and he never said anything about it. We went down to

09:03.880 --> 09:11.087
consult with Wilk Bank about his nutrition and 
animal health programs, really. But it looked

09:12.367 --> 09:28.589
like it was such a problem right there at Beeville 
and we went on down to Perry Foundation at

09:12.367 --> 09:28.589
Rockstown and saw some of the grain they had 
harvested the same variety before and after the

09:12.367 --> 09:28.589
wet season. And they offered to do a cattle feeding 
test using these two grains. to get some

09:35.519 --> 09:37.241
assessment there. They had done one test 
previously coupled to, well, last time we had this

09:37.562 --> 09:48.898
problem to a lesser degree, 1972 or 73, I guess.

09:50.099 --> 10:04.159
At any rate, we came back and I called our nutrition 
group and some other folks together for our brown

09:50.099 --> 10:04.159
bag session we have at noon on Wednesday. Dudley 
Smith came over for it and at that session in that

10:05.101 --> 10:31.902
day we pretty well formulated our ideas with 
regard to what should be done well in brief what we

10:05.101 --> 10:31.902
concluded we'd better do is first of all include 
this badly weathered grain in our grain quality

10:05.101 --> 10:31.902
evaluation Now we got the other end of this from out 
in the high plains in April when they were making a

10:32.422 --> 10:57.440
strong pitch for some work that would permit

10:32.422 --> 10:57.440
some sort of a characterization of grain on a 
quality basis that would be more closely related

10:32.422 --> 10:57.440
to its feeding value. I think a thing that caused 
them some concern up there was the fact that

10:59.742 --> 11:09.632
there's growing interest in the use of wet grain, 
like the early harvested or reconstituted idea.

11:10.333 --> 11:13.176
Does that have to be put in your airtight silos? 
Well, it does unless you've got acid treatment,

11:13.256 --> 11:19.663
which is the other thing that they're interested 
in. In the Glen Deans feed yard up there at Sunray,

11:20.784 --> 11:28.112
right east of Dumas a little ways, had been using 
the acid treatment on corn for two years. And he

11:36.145 --> 11:38.671
claimed ridiculously low losses. In other words, 
something like 7 tenths to 9 tenths of 1%. And he

11:43.752 --> 11:47.776
just got a mountain of it out there just treated and 
out there in a big old mound. You know how they do it.

11:49.097 --> 11:50.318
No, I don't really. Well, they don't make any temp. 
Put it in a bin and just pile it out there on the

11:52.160 --> 11:54.542
ground. What does the treatment, though, entail? 
Well, the treatment entails spraying what they

11:56.824 --> 12:11.818
were using is a product called Chemstore that 
really is a mixture of about 80% propionic acid and

11:56.824 --> 12:11.818
20% formalin. And they just simply spray this on. 
It's applied according to the moisture content of

12:20.076 --> 12:23.502
the grain. A higher moisture content will get a 
higher rate of application. After it's stacked?

12:29.112 --> 12:30.113
This is as it's stacked. As it's stacked. In other 
words, as they bring it in, truck by truck. It goes

12:34.428 --> 12:36.371
through a blast of this stuff? No, it goes through 
an auger thing that treats it. In other words, they

12:40.796 --> 12:42.158
spray it on. I guess you'd call it a blast if you 
wanted to. But it's nothing in the world except a

12:46.224 --> 12:50.389
little auger that's about a 10-foot auger. It's 
got a hopper at the bottom end that they can dump out

12:50.890 --> 12:55.296
of a truck into. It's just a way to pass it through. 
The grain goes up this little spiral little auger

12:56.878 --> 13:03.827
conveyor, and there's a box that's got metering 
devices on it. And it's got some nozzles strung up

13:04.685 --> 13:12.756
and down this auger that sprays this acid on there 
as it goes. And it's so rigged up that if you run out

13:12.836 --> 13:23.590
of acid or if you run out of grain, either one 
separately, it'll shut the machine down. So you

13:24.231 --> 13:29.457
won't be putting grain in that hasn't been 
treated, and you won't be running acid through

13:24.231 --> 13:29.457
with no grain. So it's kind of an automatic 
shutdown arrangement on it. Well, then this is

13:35.077 --> 13:37.961
just simply augured up and they're just pilot. And 
we've done some work with this several years back.

13:42.829 --> 13:49.059
The interesting thing about the acid treatment is 
that it apparently completely sterilizes the

13:42.829 --> 13:49.059
grain. And somebody at a meeting at Oklahoma State 
here recently, a wet grain conference, said after

13:50.180 --> 14:02.299
you treat it with acid, the stuff just lays there 
like a pile of marbles, even though it's wet. The

14:02.768 --> 14:06.395
microorganisms and whatnot are killed and it 
doesn't ferment. It stays pretty much indefinite

14:06.495 --> 14:09.481
as long as it isn't disturbed. So

14:10.983 --> 14:26.312
Dean Ray, who was a grain broker at Tulia, met with 
us up there and he said that he felt that before too

14:10.983 --> 14:26.312
long it was pretty likely all the elevator 
operators and dryers and everybody up there feel,

14:27.355 --> 14:36.986
are afraid that they're just going to get the word 
some day that said, shut her down, we haven't got

14:27.355 --> 14:36.986
the gas for you to operate. So he said, I think we're 
going to have to get geared up to handle and trade

14:37.987 --> 14:44.094
moist grain. And that would probably involve acid 
treated grain. He said, well, we don't know, we

14:47.878 --> 14:50.882
have no basis for trading it. We don't know whether 
our structures will hold it. In other words, you

14:54.716 --> 14:56.938
handle wet grain instead of dry. What's your load, 
what's your load different going to be? What will

15:01.483 --> 15:07.990
be the effect of acid in terms of corrosion and wear 
out of equipment and all that sort of things? What

15:08.210 --> 15:09.852
is in terms of nutrition? I mean, do the animals eat 
it just as readily? No problem at that level. We

15:15.177 --> 15:20.363
have fed cattle at Spur with as much We've actually 
incorporated as much as 8% acetic and propionic

15:20.680 --> 15:28.374
acid in the total mixture. In other words, 8% of the 
total mixture is this acid. Well, at 8%, we got them

15:31.901 --> 15:34.726
to reduce feed intake. And in other words, they 
just weren't doing well. We cut them back to 6%

15:38.994 --> 15:40.917
total. and finished a 150-day feeding period. So 
we know that they can tolerate this level of acid.

15:46.924 --> 15:49.947
But you said that old boy was using one-half or one 
percent? No, it's about roughly you could say one

15:49.967 --> 15:56.874
percent because his grain was pretty dry and he was 
dealing with corn instead of sorrel. What's the

15:56.894 --> 15:59.157
cost per hundred on that treatment? The best we can 
figure out the cost on it is about 17 cents a

15:59.177 --> 16:07.225
hundred. And that is on a big scale. In other words, 
if you're gonna do it small scale where they gotta

16:11.176 --> 16:19.064
ship the stuff in 55 gallon drums and all this, they 
figure it's probably about 22 or 23 cents. Well now

16:19.084 --> 16:31.436
how does that compare, John, the economics of 
drying and storage in say butler bins or elevators

16:19.084 --> 16:31.436
or whatever on a hundred basis? I have a hunch it's 
probably higher. In other words, I think that It

16:37.006 --> 16:40.291
doesn't cost that much to dry the stuff. But you 
see, you're dealing with a high level of moisture.

16:43.256 --> 16:46.080
And one reason they're using this, two reasons 
they're using it. One is that it gets away from the

16:46.942 --> 16:52.070
high energy expenditure for steam processing. 
And the other is that,

16:52.090 --> 17:00.904
presumably at least, the acid has some feeding 
value. We know that in ruminants, a big source of

17:01.677 --> 17:08.606
their energy comes from these volatile fatty 
acids that are produced in the rumen. Most of the

17:08.626 --> 17:12.551
energy is released as VFAs in the rumen. And the two 
prominent ones are acetic and propionic.

17:18.418 --> 17:24.386
And these two are produced in large quantities in 
the rumen. Therefore, it would seem perfectly

17:24.406 --> 17:28.731
logical that if we add it to the diet, why we could 
manipulate the ratio of these two in the rumen. So

17:35.958 --> 17:39.022
this is one of the reasons we got into it from a 
standpoint of interest. It looked like there

17:39.042 --> 17:48.114
might be a possibility, and we were able to change 
the acetic-procyonic acid ratios in the rumen by

17:39.042 --> 17:48.114
incorporation of this. But that's all beside the 
point as far as this story is concerned. It just

17:52.379 --> 17:54.482
happens to be one end of it. So they started an end of 
grain quality and grain characteristics and

17:54.715 --> 18:00.222
stuff out there. And the wet weather gave us the 
other end down here with a low quality grain that

18:01.083 --> 18:07.671
nobody knew what it was worth. So we felt that, 
okay, we've got both ends of the story now. It looks

18:14.500 --> 18:18.765
as if we do definitely need to do something on grain 
quality. And we felt that since we've got all this

18:19.741 --> 18:28.333
damaged grain this year, we should look at it from 
the standpoint of its physical

18:19.741 --> 18:28.333
characterization. Now, you're doubtlessly 
familiar with these U.S. grain standards. You've

18:38.646 --> 18:43.893
got a certain percentage of total damage and 
moisture content and so on. And you've got one,

18:43.913 --> 18:47.318
two, three, four in sample grade. And the grain 
that was coming to Beeville was four in sample,

18:47.500 --> 18:51.886
mostly. So it's lower. Here's what we usually 
consider a standard, number two grain. Well, is

18:56.252 --> 19:03.763
this mostly now because of, you said some of it was 
like 18%, and was it also because of so many broken

18:56.252 --> 19:03.763
kernels? Right. Sprouts, anything, whatever. 
But so we felt that, all right, we better start with

19:08.810 --> 19:14.879
the U.S. grain standards. Yeah. and see, all 
right, we will do the traditional things that are

19:15.985 --> 19:36.625
done in grading grain, and then we better pursue 
this further and do a bunch of non-traditional

19:15.985 --> 19:36.625
things that anybody thinks might be helpful in 
characterizing this grain better than is being

19:15.985 --> 19:36.625
done at the present time. So that briefly is what we 
thought about with regard to physical

19:37.426 --> 19:41.530
characterization. Can we do something more than 
is being done to characterize this as far as its

19:45.550 --> 19:49.254
feeding value is concerned. Secondly was the 
microbiological characterization. In other

19:52.658 --> 19:56.103
words, what are the molds and all this sort of stuff 
going to do? Have we got aflatoxins, mycotoxins?

19:59.406 --> 20:03.952
And that's where Pettit and Mrs. Tabor come into 
the picture. Then we felt the chemical

20:05.093 --> 20:15.085
characterization, which would involve the usual 
chemical analysis plus an amino acid

20:05.093 --> 20:15.085
determination and a gross energy determination. 
In other words, when the grain has been through

20:17.811 --> 20:21.436
this, what has happened to it? Have we lost some of 
the energy content? Has it been leached out? In the

20:26.363 --> 20:32.351
process of sprouting, have some of the starch been 
hydrolyzed and utilized to produce a sprout? Does

20:32.371 --> 20:41.443
the sprout pick up in nutrients and provide 
nutrients to compensate for the loss in the

20:32.371 --> 20:41.443
remaining grain or not? Well, I think quite 
obviously when you put this through the harvest

20:42.065 --> 20:50.342
and cleaning process, all these sprouts 
disappear, so they are lost pretty well. So that

20:50.963 --> 20:54.050
lowers it by at least that amount. That's what we 
need to know. We need to quantify that sort of

20:55.753 --> 20:57.878
thing. Let me turn this over, John, if you'll mark 
your place.
