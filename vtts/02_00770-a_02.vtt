WEBVTT

00:03.035 --> 00:04.256
Okay, and you were wounded now. When was this, D 
plus 1? I was wounded about 7 o'clock on D plus 1,

00:05.838 --> 00:12.926
about a mile out of St. Mary Glees. And I was 
actually leading a patrol because we didn't have

00:14.068 --> 00:17.892
anybody else to lead it. And I had 13 soldiers, and 
this included one sergeant and one lieutenant.

00:28.464 --> 00:31.067
And we had gone about 100 yards when I felt this 
bullet pass by and I yelled to the ditch and as I

00:32.465 --> 00:41.677
moved toward the ditch I got hit in the left 
forehead. Oh, you're lucky. Yeah, lucky. I sure

00:45.002 --> 00:47.044
was. And I was put in an aid station by this sergeant 
that was with me.

00:54.094 --> 01:01.864
And the next day transferred to an aid station in 
the field out in the open ground. that afternoon,

01:02.283 --> 01:08.810
given a blood transfusion and placed on a hospital 
ship out in the harbor there about five miles from

01:02.283 --> 01:08.810
here. Do you remember the name of the ship? No, 
never did know really. I was pretty well sedated

01:12.014 --> 01:15.618
when they carried me out. And they carried me back 
to England and landed in Southampton and took me up

01:17.400 --> 01:23.607
to the Midlands place. I've forgotten now, right 
out of Market Harbor. I can't even think of the name

01:30.346 --> 01:32.228
of this place. But anyhow, they had about 25 
hospitals in this area. How long did it take you to

01:34.511 --> 01:39.517
get from the point where you were wounded to a 
regular hospital? I think five days. Five days? I

01:44.664 --> 01:51.112
spent a night in their barn down there, the first 
night, all day and all night. And they moved me out

01:51.252 --> 01:59.222
from the barn early the next morning to this field 
place where they had all these blood bottles

01:51.252 --> 01:59.222
hanging up. They gave me some transfusion. Put me 
in a truck and carried me to the beach, and I was in a

02:02.573 --> 02:07.958
beach hospital there for about 12 hours. And then 
they put me on one of these landing crafts, carried

02:08.219 --> 02:18.388
me out and pulled us up in baskets from the landing 
craft up

02:08.219 --> 02:18.388
the side. We landed back in England, and they 
operated on me the next morning.

02:26.135 --> 02:29.378
I had considerable damage done, and I had two young 
doctors, incidentally. one from Philadelphia

02:29.932 --> 02:32.536
and one from Rochester.

02:35.120 --> 02:42.232
But they made an examination and told me what they 
thought they had to do, but they had to have my

02:35.120 --> 02:42.232
permission first. So I gave permission and they 
started operating on me the next morning at 6

02:44.495 --> 02:51.507
o'clock and operated until about 1 that 
afternoon. Could you tell me what they had to do?

02:54.131 --> 02:54.511
Yes. Well, this bone was... The bullet entered 
here and barely missed my eye and went in here and

02:56.864 --> 03:02.131
came out here. It was coming this direction. Just a 
rifle bullet? Rifle bullet, sniper in a tree, and

03:07.718 --> 03:13.405
they caught him incidentally.

03:13.545 --> 03:23.057
But it shattered all the bone in my nose and broke 
two pieces off of this bone here and broke this bone

03:23.645 --> 03:30.635
right here, broke this bone across here, came out 
about here. And when it did all this, it was so close

03:30.795 --> 03:36.823
to my eye that it detached the retina.

03:39.927 --> 03:42.571
And that's what they had spent so much time 
operating on. They tried to, they wanted to

03:42.591 --> 03:44.634
replace it if they could. They didn't know for sure 
whether they could or not. And then they had to take

03:47.938 --> 03:53.466
scrapings out of these cheekbones. and pull it 
back up into the nose and squeeze it together with a

03:54.307 --> 04:04.797
little capsule of Vaseline, warm Vaseline, and 
hope that it grew back together. And it did. It did a

04:05.618 --> 04:06.518
marvelous job. Yeah, it sure did. And I would say 
that you feel that you got rid of the best of all

04:07.579 --> 04:11.883
possible medical care. Best. In fact, after I got 
out of the hospital, I was in the hospital 42 days.

04:19.591 --> 04:22.153
They operated about 10 different times because 
they A bunch of things to do. Cut some of these bones

04:23.332 --> 04:27.657
off that were shattered. And I had to rebuild this 
thing and scrape it because little, what do you

04:27.677 --> 04:34.004
call it, spurs grew on this soft bone. And I had to 
cut them off every day. Because if they get growing

04:37.528 --> 04:42.133
too much, you can't bury it, of course. But I came 
out real well. In fact, they didn't even make any

04:43.715 --> 04:47.560
plastic surgery on me. They just replaced it and 
sewed it up. Sure did. And unless you look closely,

04:50.403 --> 04:52.225
you can't tell. I have no difficulty breathing, a 
little. This eye has about 20-90 vision. This one

04:58.955 --> 05:00.096
has 20-40.

05:02.599 --> 05:07.984
And I have a traumatic cataract that's been there 
since the day I got hit, but it hadn't grown any. I

05:09.626 --> 05:12.288
have no cataract in this eye. So you spent, what, 42 
days? 42 days in the hospital. That's counting the

05:14.250 --> 05:16.232
time I was on the field, too. From the time I got 
wounded until I got out was 42 days. Then what?

05:20.296 --> 05:20.777
Excuse me. Then what? I rejoined the division and 
the Ridgeway asked me to go with him and 12 other

05:22.411 --> 05:35.051
officers to form the cadre for the 18th Airborne 
Corps. The division had been pulled back to

05:36.253 --> 05:42.984
England from France after the initial stages of 
this thing. I think he stayed over about 30 days

05:43.004 --> 05:49.414
because they wanted to mount this hollering 
operation for the airborne divisions. So they

05:50.390 --> 05:52.452
pulled him back and they made this corps. And I went 
with General Ridgway and these officers to form

05:52.512 --> 06:01.060
the bases for the 18th Airborne Corps. The rest of 
the troops were brought over from the United

06:01.080 --> 06:03.662
States. They had been the 18th Armored Division.

06:09.327 --> 06:19.857
So we brought them over and took all of these people 
that came over from this armored division and

06:09.327 --> 06:19.857
tried to train them in parachute operations. 
These were tankers, huh? Yeah, these were

06:22.866 --> 06:23.847
tankers. And this took a lot of time. We didn't have 
much time to loot because this was in late July and

06:27.172 --> 06:36.807
they had this operation in Holland set up in 
September. So we got the operation all set and all

06:37.769 --> 06:44.979
the planes and everything, supplies, everything 
ready to go. And then General Einhard decided that

06:49.165 --> 06:58.277
there was no particular need to send both a British 
and American Corps, and this particular time

06:49.165 --> 06:58.277
you're going to let the British Corps take 
responsibility for the operation. So we sent two

06:58.478 --> 07:08.191
American divisions and a British division, and 
the British actually operated there, and they

06:58.478 --> 07:08.191
caught, well they had two up there. We came out of it 
and they brought the troops back then to the area

07:08.211 --> 07:15.561
around Reims and Epperday. Now did you go into 
Holland? No, I didn't go to Holland. I stayed in

07:18.916 --> 07:20.998
England. And then we came from England to France in 
early November. See, they mounted this operation

07:30.266 --> 07:32.067
in September. We came in early November and moved 
into the Reims. Where did you land in France? Well,

07:37.332 --> 07:47.961
we flew from an airport in England, just plain and 
time, C-47, and landed in Paris, La Borgia Field.

07:49.240 --> 07:50.482
They weren't in very good shape. They'd already 
been bombed. But we landed there and took jeeps

07:52.424 --> 07:55.868
from there up to Reims. We set up headquarters in 
Reims.

08:02.096 --> 08:11.588
Then we, from Reims in the Epernay area, we got 
these parachute people and glider people back

08:02.096 --> 08:11.588
from Holland. And they lost a lot of people. We had 
to resupply and put in new troops, brought in a lot

08:13.391 --> 08:19.078
of new officers fresh from the United States, 
second, first lieutenant, mostly. A lot of them

08:24.443 --> 08:28.106
were just out of West Point, brand new college 
graduates. We then were called into this

08:30.008 --> 08:41.819
operation on the 19th of December, I guess. On the 
19th of December, we were just called, because we

08:43.221 --> 08:47.665
were the only troops not already committed They 
just loaded us in trucks and carried us up to the

08:48.353 --> 08:51.398
Ardennes and put us out. We had two divisions and 
brought another division from England across,

08:53.181 --> 08:59.210
which was the 13th Airborne. Never been committed 
yet. Anywhere, anytime. So we slugged it out up

09:04.038 --> 09:06.662
there as ground troops, really. And we came back to 
this area and moved to the Rhine River area. where

09:16.467 --> 09:23.438
we mounted an airborne operation across the Rhine 
River at Zweifel.

09:26.883 --> 09:33.773
We sent two American and one British civilians 
across the river by air. And part of the unit, that

09:36.117 --> 09:44.770
is, we didn't send any gliders much or few, but part 
of our unit didn't go by air. went in floats and

09:45.644 --> 09:49.950
little motorboats.

09:52.533 --> 09:54.756
Actually, they were rafts with motors on them. And 
we then transferred from there down to the central

09:55.877 --> 10:02.446
part of the country. They got in trouble down in the 
river, so they sent us down into the river. This was

10:08.794 --> 10:10.657
Bradley's order. Converted us down there. And we 
slugged it out through, all through Bonn,

10:15.007 --> 10:25.783
Dillenburg, and oh,

10:15.007 --> 10:25.783
I can't think. I know we were in this little town. 
I'm trying to think of the day we heard that Mr.

10:27.546 --> 10:30.410
Roosevelt died. I can't even think of the name of 
his big cabin center there. And then we swung

10:35.617 --> 10:42.407
around to the left, and we had this thing pretty 
well under control. And they called us back to get

10:42.448 --> 10:44.811
ready to cross the Elbe River. We crossed the Elbe 
River at Beckleid.

10:51.323 --> 10:54.067
We crossed not by airborne. We did by foot troop. 
All of our paratroopers and gliders were just used

10:56.171 --> 11:02.701
as foot soldiers. And the engineers threw up a 
bridge at Beckleid, and the armor division came

11:02.721 --> 11:08.911
across the next day. We got as far as Lubbock last, 
which was, I guess, we figured

11:14.879 --> 11:26.572
we'd be in Berlin in another six or seven days if 
they'd leave us alone. And of course Patton was on

11:27.673 --> 11:32.518
his way there too, but the war ended. So we just sat 
there.

11:39.086 --> 11:41.308
And then soon after about About a week after the war 
was over, they sent me back with a group of five to

11:42.908 --> 11:55.960
Ephrony to get ready to take all these troops back 
to Red Goat Pacific to get into the invasion of

11:42.908 --> 11:55.960
Japan. I stayed with the division, with the Corps 
then until about the 20th of June, I guess, and they

11:57.802 --> 12:11.194
sent me with a group of 52 Texans who had been 
wounded two or three times. to bring them back to

12:11.647 --> 12:15.232
the United States. And I left there I guess about 
maybe the 25th of June. We landed in New York and

12:22.321 --> 12:29.511
came on to Texas, landed in Fort Sam Houston on the 
3rd of July. I got these 52 Texans that I brought

12:29.791 --> 12:35.819
back. But we had a whole train load of them, a whole 
ship load of them really that's on the ship called

12:41.144 --> 12:45.550
Champlain, which was a World War I German plane, I 
mean, ship. And we dropped off some of them in Ohio

12:47.313 --> 12:52.960
and Kentucky and all around. There was no train 
coming down. No train coming down from Fort Dix.

12:58.708 --> 13:08.382
So then they asked me if I wanted to get out of the 
service or if I wanted to stay, and I was ready to get

12:58.708 --> 13:08.382
out, so I said I'm ready, and they let me out. And I 
came to work in Texas, and then on the first of

13:08.422 --> 13:10.645
September, even though I was going to terminally 
leave until the fourth of November. One last

13:16.022 --> 13:18.286
wartime question. What do you consider was the 
toughest combat that you went through or the

13:18.306 --> 13:24.035
hardest going in Europe? What was the roughest 
time? As far as the divisions concerned, me. You

13:29.785 --> 13:31.267
personally. Well, of course I thought— Aside from 
being wounded. Yeah, I wasn't there long enough. I

13:35.754 --> 13:36.295
was just there about 24, 26, 28. I was just there 
about 30 hours before I got wounded. No, I'd say the

13:43.831 --> 13:46.895
Ardennes Campaign was the toughest. The cold? I 
was a headquarters commandant during the

13:47.476 --> 13:49.979
Ardennes Campaign. It was cold and the Germans had 
come in there with everything they had and they

13:49.999 --> 14:00.613
were scattered all over the countryside in 
American uniforms. They were specially trained

14:01.074 --> 14:06.180
people and it was hard to identify them and we had to 
be extra cautious. It was hard to get supplies up,

14:06.768 --> 14:12.255
and the weather was so bad we couldn't get any air 
support. In fact, we were there from the afternoon

14:13.737 --> 14:20.807
of the 19th of December until the 24th before I ever 
saw an American bomber. And on Christmas Eve day,

14:22.769 --> 14:30.519
we counted about a thousand American bombers that 
came by. Of course, the Germans shot a lot of them

14:31.901 --> 14:34.024
down, too. But then we lost an attack right after 
these bombers did their dirty work. They hit some

14:41.109 --> 14:45.673
of these German tanks and knocked them out that we 
were being held up by. So we made pretty good

14:47.115 --> 14:54.602
progress and went on up to Banau and Harzay and 
Frankenschamps. And they pulled our division out

14:54.742 --> 15:01.108
if we got to Frankenschamps, which is just across 
the secret line. We made pretty good progress

15:03.181 --> 15:05.023
there. But that was the roughest. Yes, it was the 
roughest. We lost a lot of people. It was day and

15:11.109 --> 15:13.051
night operation. And the Germans still had some 
pretty good bombing support along in that area.

15:20.839 --> 15:22.561
And they came in at low altitude. And this was the 
first time we ever saw any jets, incidentally.

15:25.264 --> 15:28.247
They sent in these jets at low altitude. You mean 
262. Yeah. They come scooting over those hills and

15:30.029 --> 15:33.294
drop right down on top of you. Drop a few bombs and 
you never get a chance to see them, really. And we

15:37.841 --> 15:45.973
lost a lot of people, mostly by getting minor 
wounds and freezing to death going into the shop.

15:46.754 --> 15:47.595
We lost lots of guys. Do you think maybe that the 
American Army was not prepared for that winter

15:47.615 --> 15:50.980
campaign? No, I think we were pretty well 
prepared. We were actually better prepared than

15:54.625 --> 15:57.009
the Germans. I'm talking about clothing-wise? 
Oh, yes. Yeah, we ran short on some clothing, those

16:00.455 --> 16:03.959
shoe packs, for instance. I'm just wondering if 
most American soldiers really had been trained,

16:03.979 --> 16:09.885
though, for extreme winter warfare. Not if they 
had. I know I was confused about it, and I was

16:12.627 --> 16:18.714
supposed to be smarter than they were, because I 
was older. Well, maybe if you'd been from

16:18.734 --> 16:20.856
Minnesota, you would have known. Yeah. We had a lot 
of guys from the North, incidentally, in our

16:23.138 --> 16:26.001
division. That should have been help. No, I 
learned right away not to ever take my clothes off,

16:29.497 --> 16:35.346
except often enough to change my socks and get my 
feet tied. My dad was a medical officer, and he said

16:36.107 --> 16:40.333
that the foot problems were the worst in the 
Ardennes. Yeah, lots of guys with feet and ears

16:40.353 --> 16:45.220
broke.

16:45.240 --> 16:50.408
I found lots of guys laying out there that didn't 
have anything to wear but a bullet hole through the

16:45.240 --> 16:50.408
shoulder. That's all. Now, there wouldn't be 
enough to kill a guy unless he'd bleed to death, but

16:52.150 --> 16:59.301
he was just stiff as a poker because he broke and 
went in shock, I guess. We found others that were

16:59.956 --> 17:09.846
cut half in two and picked up by the aid men and 
carried back and patched up in pretty good shape.

17:09.866 --> 17:11.528
Medical services were outstanding. This 
hospital that I was in, boy, they operated on guys

17:11.768 --> 17:16.333
up there that I didn't see how they could operate. 
Cut all the pieces, shell fragments, had feet

17:17.014 --> 17:28.866
blown off by those damn shoe mines, bayoneted by 
the Krauts, head patching, guts up. sew them

17:29.369 --> 17:32.813
together and put them out there in pretty good 
shape. Let's go on to the A&M stuff now. You came to

17:36.737 --> 17:38.379
A&M in September of 46? September of 45. As 
Veterans Advisor. How did you wind up getting this

17:43.604 --> 17:45.627
job?

17:48.410 --> 17:57.199
Well, I

17:48.410 --> 17:57.199
had applied for a job with the Veterans 
Administration. on the advice of a counselor in

17:57.449 --> 18:02.255
Fort Sam Houston Separation Center. They had a 
veteran administration man there, and they

18:03.617 --> 18:12.409
wanted a college graduate who had taught school 
and been in service to work with them in their

18:03.617 --> 18:12.409
counseling program in Waco. And I had applied, but 
they couldn't give me a decision until my term of

18:13.631 --> 18:19.378
leave was up, which was the 4th of November. And 
about the 20th of August, a man named Heaton, who

18:25.242 --> 18:28.927
was registrar, called me. And I never heard of him 
before, but he called me and said, I got your name

18:29.428 --> 18:33.653
from E.E. McQuillan, who is director of the Former 
Student Association. And we're looking for a man,

18:39.521 --> 18:43.646
and Mr. Gilchrist told me to find somebody if I 
could. And he wants a man that's an A&M graduate,

18:44.487 --> 18:48.112
preferably. One that's been in the Army. One 
that's been a schoolteacher. or taught school

18:53.086 --> 18:54.588
somewhere. And he said, he called me on Saturday 
afternoon and said, I'd like to talk to you. And I

19:02.919 --> 19:03.960
said, well, when? What do you want me to do? He said, 
won't you be a veteran's advisor? But he didn't

19:07.325 --> 19:09.648
know what that meant. So I came down on Sunday 
afternoon, right after I got out of church,

19:09.668 --> 19:21.844
Sunday, I came with my wife and we talked to the 
brand new dean of men who had just reported, had

19:09.668 --> 19:21.844
gotten out of the Army at Fort Hood, came down here 
to be dean of men. He can talk to me about it now. Who

19:23.733 --> 19:25.235
was Dean of Men at this time? Rollins. Joe Rollins? 
Joe Rollins. J.W. Joe Rollins. And they told me

19:29.420 --> 19:31.703
everything they knew about the job. Said, Mr. 
Gilchrist wanted me to come here and help the

19:31.723 --> 19:34.967
veterans. That's really what he meant. I said, 
well, help them do what? He said, get in school, get

19:37.209 --> 19:44.038
the money, find a place to live, get some 
recreation for the families, a place for the kids

19:37.209 --> 19:44.038
to live.

19:47.001 --> 19:49.384
And help them with the GI Bill. if I got any 
hospitalization problems, disability cases, or

19:49.718 --> 19:54.264
insurance problems. I want you to know, we want you 
to know everything about the GI Bill. So I said,

19:59.590 --> 20:01.332
okay, when do you want me to go to work? I didn't 
really want to go to work first September because I

20:01.392 --> 20:03.915
was tired. I hadn't gotten completely over my last 
campaign. And incidentally, that last campaign

20:09.562 --> 20:11.465
wasn't easy. Up into the, across the Elk River. 
Because we captured over, a million prisoners,

20:18.338 --> 20:29.329
and we liberated over two million concentration 
camp prisoners in our core area alone. And I was

20:30.230 --> 20:34.274
responsible for feeding these people and taking 
care of them the best we could. Until the

20:34.574 --> 20:36.116
relocation people. That's right. Initially. So 
anyhow, I went to the Veterans Administration

20:39.459 --> 20:48.008
headquarters in Waco and spent A day in the 
insurance division, a day in the education

20:49.338 --> 20:55.948
division, a day in the loan division. I learned all 
I could about D.W. I came here on the first day of

20:57.811 --> 20:59.474
September.

21:02.178 --> 21:09.930
I went to work, and in the meantime, I talked to the 
president, and he told me what he'd like for me to

21:02.178 --> 21:09.930
do, as best he knew. Who was the president? Mr. Gibb 
Gilchrist. Okay. I may ask you in a minute what your

21:12.815 --> 21:15.239
impression of him was. Go on. So I went to work, and 
they wanted me to live on campus so I'd be

21:16.304 --> 21:21.531
accessible to the students. They had an old house 
down there, and I called my wife on the telephone,

21:21.751 --> 21:28.480
told her to come home and get the stuff out of the 
storage. We had the storage in Waco during the war.

21:32.045 --> 21:39.936
And she brought it down, and we opened up a house 
down there on, right where the new athletic

21:32.045 --> 21:39.936
dormitory is. It was old Clark Street then. I guess 
it still is. had a little house there, and we lived

21:44.738 --> 21:46.620
in it. Then we moved down here to the one back of 
Grand Hall, which was the Williams house. There's

21:51.884 --> 21:56.528
none here anymore, but I was a, I was a vintage 
writer. We had 900 students, about 900 out of GI

21:56.548 --> 22:09.259
Bill, and they were, most of them knew a little bit 
about it, not much, but I set up an office in the

21:56.548 --> 22:09.259
registrar's office because they didn't have any 
other place for me. And there was a room about to, 20

22:14.050 --> 22:24.761
by 20, and I would see these veterans about 20 at a 
time, had 20 chariots in there, and I'd see them,

22:14.050 --> 22:24.761
tell them all I knew about the G.I. Bill, and then 
hand them a form and tell them, fill them out and let

22:24.781 --> 22:31.188
me see them, because I wanted them correctly 
filled out before we sent them in. And I told them

22:33.230 --> 22:40.497
what their rights and privileges were and what 
they'd get and what school would do, and Mr.

22:33.230 --> 22:40.497
Gilchrist had raised for a little loan fund so 
these guys that got out of the service without any

22:41.084 --> 22:51.076
money wouldn't have to wait, because we knew it 
might be 30 to 90 days before these guys got paid.

22:51.096 --> 22:52.718
And as it turned out, this was about right. So 
anyhow, we got along pretty good there. And about

22:58.646 --> 23:06.575
the time I was getting cleared up a little bit, a new 
semester started in October, and we got in a whole

22:58.646 --> 23:06.575
raft of guys. Remember how many? About 2,000. new 
fittings. And then in February, we jumped up to

23:12.869 --> 23:16.815
about 6,000.

23:19.239 --> 23:23.365
And one girl and I were trying to see them and tell 
them what they had to do. We remember we grabbed

23:23.605 --> 23:29.934
some poop sheets and said, this covers part of it, 
but I'll have to explain part of it. So I found a room

23:29.954 --> 23:34.621
where I could get, instead of 20 at the time, I got 
about 50, 75 in. And had a place for them to ride.

23:40.383 --> 23:49.096
And then when they'd fill all these things out, 
this girl and I would check them at night and see if

23:40.383 --> 23:49.096
they were completely accurate and then mail them 
in that same night so they'd get them in Waco. And

23:50.298 --> 23:56.347
incidentally, the veterinary administration 
had a man, a full-time man here on the campus too,

23:50.298 --> 23:56.347
helping me with some of these problems. I didn't 
know that. Mostly, he was helping mostly disabled

23:57.508 --> 24:00.112
cases. Can you remember what his name was? Oh, 
yeah, he died about a year ago.

24:12.277 --> 24:13.299
I'll check that for you. Go ahead. No, I can't 
remember. Anyhow, we gave him an office over there

24:16.926 --> 24:22.396
in Hart Hall, a pair of those rooms that joined. And 
he, see, at that time, we were issuing books and

24:23.879 --> 24:32.836
supplies and everything, too, and he helped me 
with some of the minute details. Gee, that feels a

24:32.976 --> 24:34.759
little different then than it is now. Yes, quite a 
bit. So then I had to go out, after I got all that

24:37.977 --> 24:42.783
done, I had to see if I could find someplace, and we 
did. We set up, with permission and help of the

24:42.803 --> 24:50.032
dining hall people, Jay Penderson was in charge of 
the dining hall at Speedy Hall. We set up a portion

24:51.174 --> 25:02.689
of that second floor there as a sort of a lounge, 
recreation, education area for the families of

24:51.174 --> 25:02.689
these veterans. We had converted Walton Hall and 
Hart Hall into apartments. And we took two other

25:09.518 --> 25:13.242
dormitories down there and just let a man and his 
wife live in a room. Now, let me get this again. I

25:15.544 --> 25:16.485
wasn't aware of that. Hart Hall was in Walton. Hart 
Hall. We took two rooms. You see those rooms in

25:20.769 --> 25:22.010
Hart? They have a bathroom in between. They used to 
live in them. Yeah. Yeah. Well, then we made an

25:24.813 --> 25:26.835
apartment out of that. Now, what year was this? 
19... Well, we started this operation. It took us

25:31.619 --> 25:33.281
about a year to get it all done. We started this 
operation shortly after I came here. Mr. Spence

25:36.247 --> 25:37.908
and Calvin Moore. And I collaborated with Mr. 
Gilchrist on this and we got these things all

25:39.090 --> 25:49.359
converted and put in a little stove and a little 
refrigerator and still use the bunk beds. Yeah.

25:51.020 --> 25:53.582
And had a desk for the guy. So they had really kind of 
a living room kitchen affair and then a bedroom on

25:54.083 --> 25:58.747
the other side. That's what he meant to. How long 
did that go on? That went on about two years and then

26:02.390 --> 26:05.393
we got We, incidentally, we started working right 
away to get some of those old trailers, what they

26:06.233 --> 26:14.643
call mobile homes that the Air Force people used to 
use. We put some of them right down there where

26:14.944 --> 26:19.429
Coliseum is now. Then on down toward the south, 
right next to the American Legion House on both

26:19.449 --> 26:25.677
sides of the street, we put those prefabs in. We had 
about 200 of those. Now we took, we got about 12, 13

26:28.160 --> 26:32.625
of those old Navy houses from Orange, Texas. 
Where'd you get the College View? We got them from

26:35.950 --> 26:43.100
Air Force Base down there. Victoria? Victoria. 
Foster Field. Foster? Mm-hmm. Okay. And they

26:49.008 --> 26:55.757
moved them up here and installed them with 
whatever pipes and fixes they could get, and we

26:49.008 --> 26:55.757
started renting them as fast as we could. And you 
began to clear the people out. We began to need them

26:58.080 --> 27:03.107
for single people. We didn't need them because we 
had three men in all the rooms. This wasn't good,

27:06.528 --> 27:10.694
because they're not built for three. But we set up 
this place, and we got somebody, and I don't even

27:10.714 --> 27:21.768
remember now, I think, the extension service 
managed to get some

27:10.714 --> 27:21.768
sewing machines. And they had classes for these 
wives to teach them how to sew and how to pick out

27:21.848 --> 27:31.882
curtain materials and how to cook and cut meat and 
buy meat and stuff like that. They had a few pool

27:32.582 --> 27:35.286
tables and a few ping pong tables. put down in that 
old dining hall, second floor there. And

27:41.077 --> 27:51.171
we built little drying yards in the back of the 
apartments where the kids' diapers could be dried

27:41.077 --> 27:51.171
and stuff like that. What were your major problems 
now during this, other than innovating a program

27:51.852 --> 27:59.122
that had never been tried before? Do you think 
there were any major problems that you had? Yes,

28:01.084 --> 28:03.147
there were some problems because... That you 
can't talk about? A good many of these people were

28:05.371 --> 28:15.603
more crowded in, even though they'd been crowded 
up during the war, they were crowded in in short

28:05.371 --> 28:15.603
quarters. And those people that lived off the 
campus, remember now, we had 6,000 people here,

28:16.083 --> 28:28.577
and a high percentage of these people were 
married, had a wife at least, and most of them had

28:16.083 --> 28:28.577
children. When they moved off the campus, they 
lived in chicken coops and every kind of thing.

28:32.261 --> 28:33.623
They didn't like this, and they weren't happy. And 
we were, too, because a lot of them weren't even

28:34.717 --> 28:37.120
sanitary. And we had to fight their battles, 
incidentally, with the rent control people,

28:38.502 --> 28:44.711
because they were making these guys pay under the 
table. They'd come tell me, and I'd have to go to the

28:44.772 --> 28:53.444
rent control people and say, I know this is a fact, 
and I'm willing to go to court and testify. I see.

28:53.604 --> 28:56.869
Because we felt like we ought to represent these 
kids. These were men, really. And some of the wives

29:00.474 --> 29:04.420
were unhappy because they didn't have any 
recreational facilities. See, we didn't even let

29:05.564 --> 29:09.929
them go swimming at the swimming pool and stuff 
like that. The only thing we had was an old campus

29:09.949 --> 29:13.193
picture show at Guyon Hall. And we didn't even 
have, we had three bowling alleys, one under four

29:14.675 --> 29:18.941
in a YMCA base. And this is not many. We had a few ping 
pong tables. So they didn't have any place for

29:23.787 --> 29:27.111
recreation and entertainment. And the 
university hadn't decided for sure who could go to

29:27.231 --> 29:31.096
football games. And all these guys weren't 
carrying their wires, of course, and stuff like

29:31.116 --> 29:34.660
that. They finally did, but we had to go represent 
them, and we want these Y's in at the same rate the

29:35.365 --> 29:46.798
students get in, because these guys can't afford 
commercial rates. And they got so many people

29:46.818 --> 29:51.704
going to basketball games, and we alternated. Up 
to a certain letter would go one time, and the next

29:52.385 --> 29:59.974
time the other group would go, so you couldn't see 
but half the ball games. And they were better

29:59.994 --> 30:02.537
pleased, and those that didn't, have places to 
cook, to go in the dining hall and eat, which was

30:02.905 --> 30:07.209
new. We never had let this happen before. And some 
of the ladies wanted to go to school then. And they

30:16.577 --> 30:20.220
still had a policy against ladies going to school 
except in summertime. They'd let them go in

30:21.941 --> 30:25.444
summer, but they would let them go in the fall and 
spring. Couldn't go to the college hospital. And

30:28.387 --> 30:32.170
this was a problem because with 6,000 new families 
in town, The medical staff here in Brown couldn't

30:32.808 --> 30:37.273
take care of them. And there was no real system for 
hiring these girls to work at that time. And

30:43.821 --> 30:53.492
incidentally, this girl who worked for me, whose 
husband was a student, incidentally, she had a

30:43.821 --> 30:53.492
master's degree from Rice. But her husband was 
tech and civil engineering and was a bomber pilot.

30:57.536 --> 30:59.939
And she knew about all this stuff. So she and I 
organized it first. program for helping these

31:02.710 --> 31:04.792
girls find jobs. So if a veteran's wife, and we 
specified a veteran's wife because we're not

31:04.832 --> 31:11.779
supposed to be the rest of them married. So they'd 
come and ask me if I knew where to get a job. Well, I

31:15.422 --> 31:18.745
contacted all the officers on the campus and told 
them we had a veteran. She said, please let me know.

31:21.548 --> 31:25.512
And we hired lots of girls through our office, this 
little girl and I. All we'd do is find out where the

31:25.532 --> 31:28.115
jobs were and send them to them. So this was kind of a 
placement office on the side then? Sort of, yeah.

31:33.052 --> 31:39.041
Any student that didn't have enough money come in 
and say, sir, I got a grocery bill. I got a child in

31:39.081 --> 31:40.523
the hospital. What can I do? Well, so I'd go to Mr. 
Gilchrist again and say, Mr. Gilchrist, these

31:42.105 --> 31:49.356
guys don't have enough money to do this. So he set 
aside a certain amount of money in the fiscal

31:50.398 --> 31:53.282
office. I don't know where he got the money. I guess 
it was out of one of these slush funds they had. And

31:58.570 --> 32:01.354
he told me that we could loan up to $100 for 90 days, 
for instance. So I just had a guy sign a bill for

32:04.977 --> 32:07.139
them. I promised to pay within 90 days. No 
interest. And we collected most of it. We didn't

32:14.067 --> 32:14.928
lose very much. We didn't lose much. We didn't lose 
many of them. What do you think of the veterans as a

32:16.891 --> 32:18.793
whole coming back? You think they were pretty good 
students as a whole? Those students, yeah. That

32:22.377 --> 32:27.864
was the best thing that ever happened with Texas 
A&M, in my opinion, because they raised the

32:22.377 --> 32:27.864
scholastic standards. And I know this because of 
cadets as a whole. They didn't want those veterans

32:31.962 --> 32:37.831
over here because, first place, they weren't in 
uniform. Then many didn't go back into the Corps

32:37.851 --> 32:40.095
when they came back? Not very many went back in. 
Few. A few. Not very many. You see, you got to

32:44.722 --> 32:48.889
remember, too, that a hell of a lot of these guys 
were officers already. And a lot of them majors and

32:49.930 --> 32:52.995
lieutenant colonels. One hell of a lot of 
lieutenants and captains, but there were a lot of

32:53.015 --> 32:56.961
majors and lieutenant colonels. And a few chicken 
colonels. I thought maybe you might have a few of

32:58.304 --> 33:02.390
the enlisted types that came back and wanted a 
commission. They were. They were. And I remember

33:04.413 --> 33:07.959
the 1st Sergeant of F Company. I remember the 1st 
Sergeant of B Company. They were enlisted men. One

33:12.145 --> 33:14.348
of them was a Marine incidentally. And they got 
commissions. We had one company of nothing but

33:17.713 --> 33:20.878
veterans. One full company. Everybody in there 
was a veteran. And they did a real good job. They

33:27.532 --> 33:29.836
didn't try to throw their weight around or 
anything. In other words, you don't think that the

33:31.138 --> 33:38.849
veterans coming back were not any rougher than 
those that were here then? No. Those, in fact, they

33:39.611 --> 33:41.353
were better. In fact, a lot of the things that we 
found out were going on in the corps that we didn't

33:42.535 --> 33:50.587
like, information was given to us by veterans. A 
lot of them were ex-Aggies, incidentally, that

33:50.607 --> 33:56.256
had been here before the war and came back. I said, 
they're running it. They're brutalizing the

33:59.407 --> 34:01.109
thing. Now, we don't want our name mentioned, 
please. I said, no, anything you tell me, then go

34:04.332 --> 34:07.075
beyond. I never even told Mr. Gilkish where I got my 
information. Then some of the hazing that went on

34:10.078 --> 34:14.002
was really not caused by the veterans coming back. 
No. No, most of it was caused by the new students

34:14.783 --> 34:17.225
coming in. That's right. That's something I 
didn't know. Yeah. When I went to work at A&M, they

34:20.909 --> 34:22.851
were about I don't remember exactly now, but there 
was approximately 1,900 freshman cadets and

34:23.438 --> 34:32.226
about 100 upperclassmen cadets. Now, a lot of 
these upperclassmen were veterinarians who had

34:34.188 --> 34:40.895
been exempt, see, on account of the practice that 
they were getting into. And a few of these guys were

34:42.556 --> 34:46.040
veterans who had come back. I remember one guy that 
had a whole hand shot off, and they let him be a

34:46.460 --> 34:49.643
cadet. And he was a junior. He didn't cause any 
trouble, but all these sophomores were the ones he

34:53.257 --> 34:59.024
caused trouble. And there weren't very many of 
them. But they were not veterans. No, they were

35:03.189 --> 35:07.074
flailing and living there outside of those poor 
freshmen. Is this the time that they moved the

35:07.174 --> 35:09.317
freshmen to? Well, they did that later. I don't 
remember because, see, they were still operating

35:11.179 --> 35:16.205
the base out there. And I think it was about 19-

35:23.210 --> 35:27.977
I think it was about 1948 or 49 that they opened that 
base out there for those freshmen. I'm not sure

35:29.739 --> 35:51.529
about that date, but it was, I know I served, I 
served, well, let me go on and get this thing, this

35:29.739 --> 35:51.529
date thing may fall into place here, but I, no, I 
thought the veterans on the whole, now they were,

35:29.739 --> 35:51.529
they caused some problems because they, for 
instance, they had what they called a revolt

35:29.739 --> 35:51.529
meeting over there one night, and I went to the 
president of this Veterans Association and told

35:52.302 --> 36:01.291
him that I was working for the university and I'm 
the veterans advisor and I want to know what you all

35:52.302 --> 36:01.291
are going to do. He said, it's not any of your 
business. I said, it sure is. Anything you do on

36:05.455 --> 36:08.719
this campus is none of my business. Now I want to 
know what you're going to discuss. So he said,

36:10.360 --> 36:12.002
we're going to protest. What are you going to 
protest? So I said, I'm coming. I'm coming to the

36:16.547 --> 36:18.208
meeting. And I was. I went over and sat on the front 
row where he couldn't miss seeing me. But I told him

36:22.677 --> 36:30.508
before the meeting started that I wanted to 
reserve the right to speak for the university if

36:22.677 --> 36:30.508
they're going to have a revolt meeting. But I 
didn't want him to stand up there and tell them much

36:30.528 --> 36:36.997
stuff that wasn't so, and have these umpteen-up 
thousand guys go away unhappy. Now, they were

36:38.019 --> 36:39.781
protesting. Here's what some of them did. I'll 
show you how they did. Now, they didn't do much

36:42.245 --> 36:43.747
thinking. They didn't want three guys in a room. 
They said the food was too high. I think the food was

36:50.416 --> 36:53.640
about $20, $25 a month, maybe $30. Room rent was $5 a 
month. Hospital fee was $5 a semester. They didn't

37:01.529 --> 37:03.551
have any parking lots. What they did have was just 
dirt, and a few, one or two, had gravel on them. When

37:09.218 --> 37:12.201
they'd get bogged down, it was aggravated. And a 
lot of these veterans had cars, no parking places.

37:15.985 --> 37:16.686
Nobody did. Professors didn't even have a good 
place.

37:22.695 --> 37:31.028
One of the things that they want to do is demand that 
they eliminate English 101 and 102. It's limited.

37:32.991 --> 37:34.854
Now, these were absurdities, of course. They had 
justifiable reasons in their own opinions why

37:37.378 --> 37:43.107
they ought to just delete limited stuff. Well, 
they went through all this stuff, and they told a

37:44.437 --> 38:04.926
lot of things that weren't so, and so this 
president of the association wasn't going to let

37:44.437 --> 38:04.926
me speak, and so I held up my hand and walked up on the 
stage and said, I'd like to speak for the

37:44.437 --> 38:04.926
university, because there have been some things 
said here which are not completely correct.

38:04.946 --> 38:08.911
I said, I'll take them one by one in order that they 
were introduced here. You people voted on these

38:09.412 --> 38:10.714
things. You want to delete English. A&M couldn't 
delete English if they wanted to. They wouldn't

38:19.885 --> 38:24.871
want to in the first place, but they couldn't if 
they wanted to because the Southern Association

38:19.885 --> 38:24.871
would bar us. They'd discredit us completely. 
Now, it's just that simple. Now, A&M's not going to

38:29.457 --> 38:33.362
eliminate English 101 and 102. And I don't have to 
ask the president about that. Now, you talked

38:38.888 --> 38:41.832
about, you talked about you know, we want two guys 
in the room. I said, now which, if y'all really want

38:44.597 --> 38:53.445
this, and you voted it, I wanted 30 of you to come in 
tomorrow and resign. Because it's just that

38:55.106 --> 38:56.207
simple. There's no other place to go. And if we're 
going to have two in a room, that's a third of all the

38:58.969 --> 39:02.392
guys here got to leave. Now which third wants to go? 
So they hadn't thought about that. So then, Some

39:12.676 --> 39:17.720
guy up in the balcony, he jumped up, and he had his 
wife with him. And he said, I think we ought to

39:18.501 --> 39:25.747
reconsider everything we voted on, because I 
didn't think about that. I'm glad Mr. Zinn came

39:26.969 --> 39:29.451
here, and I didn't think about that. And I said, 
well, I'm going to go a little further.

39:35.096 --> 39:37.398
We have to know how many people are coming down. And 
that's the reason we required all of you to live in

39:37.578 --> 39:40.560
the dormitory to eat there. We have to know how 
many. And if we don't, and half of you don't go,

39:43.186 --> 39:48.472
we've got to go up on the food prices. We've got to 
double it. And this is prohibitive to a lot of

39:50.474 --> 39:53.657
people. Sure, we can go up on the real rent to 
attend, but Mr. Yerkes doesn't want to go up on it.

39:58.683 --> 40:03.028
He wants to let it stay as low as possible so the poor 
guy can go to school, too. And I don't want to talk to

40:04.749 --> 40:06.632
him about all these things. And we're not being 
arbitrary about it. And I'm not talking about what

40:10.220 --> 40:11.982
was then. I'm talking about the university now. 
We've got to try to run a sensible educational

40:14.565 --> 40:18.510
institution. This is not a madhouse. So they 
called back, and they stayed up there until about

40:20.813 --> 40:24.398
midnight. And they said, we'd like to forget about 
all this revolting business. Now, they did have

40:32.007 --> 40:33.930
some later ones, too. And I went to several of them 
where they'd have some. quietly organized over

40:40.679 --> 40:43.522
there. Do you remember what the approximate date 
of this meeting was? What year? Yes, that was

40:47.286 --> 40:58.657
in—one

40:47.286 --> 40:58.657
of these meetings was in the spring of 1946,

40:47.286 --> 40:58.657
pretty soon after this program got full flushed. 
And then one of them was in October of 1946, and we

40:58.677 --> 41:10.129
had another one in 1947 by October.

41:12.387 --> 41:17.314
They even had signs trying to get people to block 
out the dining hall because they were charging too

41:12.387 --> 41:17.314
much. I don't remember which one this was, but I 
went down there and talked to them. I said, well, if

41:21.119 --> 41:24.023
that's what you want to do, go ahead. But you're not 
hurting anybody. But where are you going to eat? I

41:27.228 --> 41:30.092
bet you weren't having that in cafes in Bradley 
County. They couldn't eat there as cheaply

41:30.112 --> 41:31.333
anyway. No, they couldn't. So they got a 
committee. I said, get your committee. So they got

41:37.462 --> 41:41.247
a committee, and the committee went with the, 
assistant to the patroller, and I can't even think

41:42.256 --> 41:45.962
his name now. He was athletic director as well.

41:50.809 --> 41:51.330
I can't even. Anyhow, he was business manager at 
Charlton State before he came here. He went with

41:56.718 --> 42:10.879
this committee to about five or six good 
universities and ate, and they measured how many

41:56.718 --> 42:10.879
ounces of potatoes for 20 cents, and how many 
ounces for a dime, and how many ounces of steak did

41:56.718 --> 42:10.879
they get. And they came back and they said, we're 
sorry, we got a better deal than any university in

42:11.433 --> 42:16.801
the state. They called off the dogs and they 
publicized this in the battalion and the students

42:18.263 --> 42:22.489
quit yelling about it. This is sort of a mob thing. A 
lot of these guys hadn't been to college, don't

42:26.614 --> 42:29.018
forget that. It's kind of funny, it seems like we go 
through this every ten years or so. That's right.

42:34.686 --> 42:39.092
They went through it while I was here. Yeah. The 
students studied real well, and I made good

42:40.863 --> 42:46.531
grades, and they went around the clock. They went 
to school until they graduated, and most of them

42:46.612 --> 42:50.077
graduated. And most of them had a real good 
attitude. I never had very many guys come in my

42:54.002 --> 42:59.030
office the whole time I worked as Veterans 
Advisor. It was not appreciated as what the

42:59.190 --> 43:05.299
government and the college did for their 
education. Now, they knew that Some things maybe

43:08.369 --> 43:12.814
could have been done and should have been that we 
weren't doing. But I had lots of them come by and

43:14.937 --> 43:21.604
make suggestions about what to do. Well, if it's 
reasonable, we appointed a committee. If they

43:26.069 --> 43:31.616
didn't want to do it themselves, we appointed a 
committee out of the dean's office and told them to

43:26.069 --> 43:31.616
study it and bring it back. And from this, then, we 
appointed a committee of seven, I think. and sent

43:36.567 --> 43:39.812
them to Oklahoma State University, I believe. 
Maybe Norman. Yeah, Oklahoma University at

43:40.914 --> 43:43.519
Norman. We paid the expenses and sent them up there 
to stay a week to study what they did up there in the

43:43.539 --> 43:52.093
way of student government. We sent one staff 
representative with them. And they came back and

43:54.858 --> 43:58.103
they wrote up all of their suggestions there. And 
we looked it all over and had a lot of other students

43:59.517 --> 44:06.085
talk about it, think about it, had a mass meeting 
and invite anybody who wanted to come. We

44:06.225 --> 44:10.350
discussed this and organized the first student 
council. And up until that time, all of the

44:11.852 --> 44:18.419
decisions had been made by the core staff about 
student life problems. And I worked with the

44:20.402 --> 44:27.330
veterans and assistant commander worked with the 
cadets and we finally got this all nailed down to

44:27.850 --> 44:54.600
the point where we had this council i said i think 
the position of either seven and nine and i forgot

44:27.850 --> 44:54.600
anyhow i want to say nine i think there are four 
cadets and four veterans and one non-veteran

44:27.850 --> 44:54.600
non-cadet and that poor guy had to make all 
decisions because everything came up the cadets

44:27.850 --> 44:54.600
voted in blocks I didn't vote in block, and this guy 
had to make a decision. I said, that's wrong. The

45:00.499 --> 45:05.325
first guy that did this was a guy named Lehamadou, a 
Frenchman from Louisiana. He came to me and said,

45:06.327 --> 45:09.131
Mr. Denton, I'm making all the college decisions. 
Every vote we've had except one has been split, and

45:10.492 --> 45:15.299
I've had to make a deciding vote. So we changed 
that.

45:19.504 --> 45:23.269
We changed it, and it's got to be a majority vote. No 
split decision possible at all. And then the next

45:26.626 --> 45:30.760
year after that, we recommended to the dean. And in 
the meantime, I had gone to the commandant's

45:30.780 --> 45:38.425
office as assistant commandant to try to help iron 
out some of the problems
