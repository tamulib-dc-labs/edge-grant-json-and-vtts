WEBVTT

00:05.667 --> 00:31.523
well let's

00:05.667 --> 00:31.523
get

00:05.667 --> 00:31.523
back here temporarily just briefly and then he got 
a job

00:05.667 --> 00:31.523
with um

00:37.561 --> 00:53.958
which was taken over by Sun Oil,

00:37.561 --> 00:53.958
and he became the vice president of Sun Oil in 
charge of research. It

00:54.538 --> 01:04.969
was about that time they were beginning catalytic 
cracking.

01:13.100 --> 01:17.166
Sun Oil was the first one to have catalytic 
cracking. They had batch units,

01:17.186 --> 01:26.660
multiple tanks in which they...

01:26.681 --> 01:27.001
Bets. B-E-T-T-S. Bets units? Is that what they 
were calling it? What kind of unit? The Bets unit?

01:34.312 --> 01:34.993
No, a batch. Batch unit. I'm sorry. Batch unit. 
Okay. Yeah, right. Okay. Okay. And then later they

01:41.821 --> 01:46.829
went on to continue to flow. Okay.

01:50.394 --> 01:51.856
Now can you shut your thing off? Yes, sir. Just 
briefly. But anyway, I could go and tell you lots of

01:55.061 --> 02:03.934
stories about you, but it's not relevant. No, it 
isn't, but I'd like to talk to you about it someday.

02:06.298 --> 02:08.041
It's really interesting. We have a man here with 
us. with me in 56 down there, Gabriel Oliver. And

02:16.194 --> 02:20.960
he's been teaching here for A&M, but he taught at 
Prairie View for many years. And he was

02:22.182 --> 02:27.329
there when I was there in 56. He was going to teach 
physics.

02:36.101 --> 02:39.385
But then when I came back,

02:42.773 --> 02:46.298
It was around Christmas of 59. Well, it was after 
the first year. It was right after the first year in

02:48.000 --> 02:55.549
60 when Castro already became . And then Pillar at 
the University of Houston heard about me and had

02:56.551 --> 03:08.987
this job down in Ecuador and offered me. That job 
was supposed to be for two years. Then at Emmington

03:12.693 --> 03:18.241
it took three years, where I spent two years there. 
Did you enjoy that? Very, very much so. We built up

03:22.167 --> 03:24.631
the chemical engineering department there. Set 
up a laboratory and taught people to teach.

03:31.241 --> 03:36.329
Organized the teaching of

03:31.241 --> 03:36.329
it. But it was more, there was a lot of politics 
involved down there. We were in competition with

03:40.638 --> 03:48.370
the University of Michigan that had a unit in 
Quito. And they were setting up chemical

03:50.092 --> 03:53.978
engineering in Quito. So we were in competition. 
Was the federal government involved in this? Yes.

04:00.208 --> 04:03.233
The University of Houston had a contract. A&M had a 
contract with India.

04:09.933 --> 04:18.563
They

04:09.933 --> 04:18.563
went over there. It was

04:19.945 --> 04:29.215
just an educational contract with the country.

04:30.657 --> 04:34.101
I was paid by the University of Houston, but they in 
turn charged a gun month for my salary, and

04:35.161 --> 04:38.584
everything was spent. It was a project.

04:44.090 --> 04:47.513
Frank Tiller was the one in charge of it. That

04:47.533 --> 04:53.959
should have been a good experience. So you stayed 
there in... Just about three years. About three.

04:59.345 --> 05:00.706
You came back here in 63? Came back Christmas of 63. 
And started teaching in the spring? I came back,

05:07.473 --> 05:09.376
yeah, spring term.

05:15.866 --> 05:18.790
If I had stayed any longer down there, they 
wouldn't have hired me back then. Yeah, I know. I

05:19.771 --> 05:22.235
had to take a physical when I came back. Did you? 
Yeah. In the 60s now at A&M, I know it's hard to get,

05:29.279 --> 05:38.431
you know, sort out the time frame, but is there 
anything special going on in chemical

05:29.279 --> 05:38.431
engineering or with people or hiring? There was a 
lot of new hiring, wasn't there, about that time?

05:41.635 --> 05:41.935
Yeah. In 63, 64, all the way through the 60s, I 
guess. Well, they hired one or two.

05:53.510 --> 05:59.117
I don't remember when

05:53.510 --> 05:59.117
all along in there, back there, Dick Davison, Dr. 
Davison. Yeah, I talked to him. And Ron Darby.

06:04.190 --> 06:05.491
Yeah, I talked to Ron. And Leo Durbin came in. Yeah, 
Leo Durbin. And they were the only ones there up

06:09.377 --> 06:17.267
even through the 60s. Okay. Well, now, we did have 
some other people came in and left

06:18.368 --> 06:25.718
intermittently. Yeah. Felt them in a flat. who 
went to work for the nuclear plant up in

06:28.595 --> 06:34.945
Washington.

06:35.967 --> 06:42.137
And another fellow who became the editor of the Oil 
and Gas Journal. Oh, okay. And I can't remember his

06:42.478 --> 06:44.100
name off the end. They came in with Kirkbride, 
about Kirkbride's

06:45.362 --> 06:52.434
career. I don't know if they were his graduate 
students or two, but they became There was really a

06:56.270 --> 07:01.416
big, hot market for chemical engineers about that 
time. Yes, there was. And then there was another

07:02.638 --> 07:14.192
one

07:02.638 --> 07:14.192
that went to work for Dow here. He was a graduate and 
taught graduate work in collective research. And

07:24.113 --> 07:29.641
he was here for a year or two, and then we went to Dow. 
I'm going to go through all the catalogs. I haven't

07:30.983 --> 07:31.864
done that yet. Yeah. And then when I retired, just 
about the time I retired, they hired your

07:34.728 --> 07:46.304
president, Ray Anthony. And you retired in what 
year? 1974. 1974, yeah. When I retired, they hired

07:50.860 --> 07:57.066
right away three people, or four people. Never 
failed.

08:01.891 --> 08:06.315
Hanson came in about that time. He was there before 
I retired. And I think Ray Anthony was there just

08:08.978 --> 08:15.144
before I retired.

08:15.164 --> 08:20.209
I think he came in about 64 or 65 or something like 
that. by Dan Hanson and Ray Anthony. And they're

08:25.155 --> 08:27.277
the only ones outside of me. And Bill Harris, of 
course, is part of it. Now, Bill Harris took his

08:32.003 --> 08:35.007
master's degree. Harris is part of the master's 
degree. Oh, is that right? Yeah, he told me about

08:38.010 --> 08:38.992
it. Yeah. And then they got a doctorate degree up in 
University of Colorado. One year, he said. One

08:44.859 --> 08:45.440
year of work. That was a tough year. Did

08:48.775 --> 09:14.263
you, over time, see much change in the way chemical 
engineering was being—I don't know if this is the

08:48.775 --> 09:14.263
right word—what was changing in the field, in the 
profession of chemical engineering? You said

09:14.904 --> 09:16.065
there was a broad How have things changed since you 
entered the business? We had the teaching of it,

09:18.803 --> 09:23.470
yes. I can go way back to when I was taking chemical 
engineering. We took laboratories. In our

09:32.803 --> 09:44.900
freshman year, we took even a foundry

09:32.803 --> 09:44.900
and a pipe thinning course. Oh, good. a machine 
shop course in my freshman year. We had three

09:51.746 --> 09:52.907
semesters. There's a quarter of the system up 
there. And then of course, when I came down here, of

09:57.071 --> 10:05.940
course, our students took mechanical 
engineering and civil engineering courses.

10:08.422 --> 10:15.870
Testing, laboratory testing, and strength of 
materials, and even the and thermodynamics

10:16.576 --> 10:31.670
course in mechanical

10:16.576 --> 10:31.670
engineering, and mechanical

10:16.576 --> 10:31.670
engineering laboratory. And those have been 
dropped. They don't take those laboratory

10:34.853 --> 10:39.457
courses anymore. And they have reduced, when I was 
in chemical engineering, We had experiments in

10:46.900 --> 10:56.194
chemical processing, as well as distillation, 
filtration, and we made chemicals.

10:59.098 --> 11:05.688
And after that, we made tri-sodium phosphate, 
showed them how to crystallize it out and purify

10:59.098 --> 11:05.688
it. And we made some dyes, and we made soap.

11:15.202 --> 11:15.422
Yeah. We conducted fermentation with lactic 
acid. In those days, a good deal of the chemicals

11:21.813 --> 11:29.320
were made by fermentation.

11:29.341 --> 11:36.628
But down here then, we had no processing, and we had 
our unit operations. And we had a very

11:36.648 --> 11:46.337
good setup, distillation, filtration, and some 
of the rest of them. The computer came in, and we

11:46.739 --> 11:51.044
began to optimize things on the computer. Way back 
there, over the years, we did pretty well in the

11:52.906 --> 12:10.204
yearly AICHE problems.

12:10.624 --> 12:13.287
Our students did very well in those problems. And 
then, of course, they'll probably begin to use

12:14.920 --> 12:19.066
computers. And now the students don't feel like, 
for example, K-transfer, dyslexia very much.

12:30.602 --> 12:33.806
They just have a computer problem. And it's hard to 
understand what's taking place.

12:39.214 --> 12:42.058
Now, just before I retired, I had a job with with 
Anderson Clayton, in which I designed the

12:44.654 --> 13:00.272
recovery system for ethyl

12:44.654 --> 13:00.272
alcohol. And they contracted it badly.

13:05.057 --> 13:11.024
And I went over there and

13:05.057 --> 13:11.024
studied the plan. I climbed the tower and operated 
the valves. And I don't think these students could

13:15.451 --> 13:17.954
do that. Yeah. And so it's much more theoretical, 
much more... It's too theoretical. Yeah. Yes.

13:27.326 --> 13:28.768
It's a lot less hands-on. They don't get enough 
hands-on knowledge of what's actually taking

13:28.828 --> 13:34.335
place physically. Yeah. Yeah, I've heard. I did a 
history of Johnson Space Center for NASA. And that

13:43.109 --> 13:48.595
was a common complaint, you know, that engineers 
now are just a different breed of cat. That's

13:48.916 --> 13:49.336
right. And they really don't have the feel in a way, 
which is almost a physical thing, for materials

13:49.496 --> 14:02.671
and design and whatever it was that they were 
working with. And including aeronautical

14:02.691 --> 14:06.155
engineers they were really talking about. You 
just have to get in there and feel the material in

14:06.175 --> 14:09.619
order to make it work. And now it's all done on 
computers and and very abstract. And the old

14:14.376 --> 14:18.762
timers especially are not convinced this is the 
way it always is. And I think they have a good point,

14:18.782 --> 14:21.145
frankly. And if the system ever broke down, you 
wonder what would happen then. That's right.

14:25.010 --> 14:26.452
Because you don't have that basic knowledge. 
Well, I'll tell you, when we got unit out of the lab,

14:26.612 --> 14:39.508
then we would kind of slip around and open up a valve 
to the sewer arm before they had started the

14:26.612 --> 14:39.508
operation. And then he said, well, get this thing 
off-riding. And it wouldn't work. And it wouldn't

14:44.954 --> 14:45.695
work. You'd have to hunt and hunt and find out what 
was wrong with it. Yeah. It's a good experience.

14:52.924 --> 14:54.446
That's what it's all about. Now, even

14:54.646 --> 15:09.145
up at Iowa State,

14:54.646 --> 15:09.145
Doc Sweeney was in the quiz and said, well, how big 
is that motor on that driver over there? What size

15:09.165 --> 15:10.086
is it? And

15:10.741 --> 15:18.931
why did it take less power when you were running it 
when it was running idle? The

15:19.112 --> 15:29.525
power factor was off when it was idle, so it 
indicated more power. Well, things like that that

15:29.545 --> 15:34.231
we had to... Really challenge it, yeah. Yeah, 
yeah. Incidentally, before I get away from here,

15:35.933 --> 15:40.579
what... Let's see, Dean Benson. How was he as a 
dean? He made a very good dean because he was

15:47.856 --> 15:54.404
hard-headed and he wouldn't put up with any 
nonsense. And he did push things quite well. Now,

16:01.674 --> 16:09.604
I got along fine with him.

16:10.107 --> 16:12.651
I would go in when Holland was not available. I 
would go in to the Dean's meetings and work with

16:12.671 --> 16:17.517
him. But he was okay. He has a peculiarity

16:21.563 --> 16:29.774
in that he doesn't seem to recognize people. 
Benson? Benson. You meet him on the street, you

16:32.518 --> 16:35.222
don't know whether he knows you or not. Knows 
you're not, yeah. But I think he's having trouble

16:36.719 --> 16:42.828
now, that way. Even before that, I think maybe 
we'll say Dr. Lindsay and he happened to be on the

16:42.888 --> 16:51.341
same plane coming back from Washington. Well, 
maybe he didn't even know. Paying attention to

16:53.365 --> 16:56.830
Lindsay, although he was right there. That was the 
way he was. Kind of distracting, yeah.

17:04.602 --> 17:05.443
Let's see. But anyway, he was a good dean. Yeah. I'm 
trying to think of anything you think that, if you

17:10.074 --> 17:25.331
were going to write a history of the Department of 
Chemical Engineering in your time, what would you

17:10.074 --> 17:25.331
think would be the most important thing that needs 
to be said?

17:25.351 --> 17:26.252
That's a big question. Well, I think you've got the 
right idea, pretty well, in terms of doing how

17:26.352 --> 17:34.080
chemical engineering changed through the years 
along with the change in the department. Not just

17:38.279 --> 17:42.123
the history of the department, but the change in 
chemical engineering. That's a very good way to

17:42.143 --> 17:44.526
look at it.

17:48.790 --> 17:53.235
When I was here, I started, of course, the drawing 
department. Here's another thing they don't do

17:53.655 --> 17:56.678
anymore. We had two visits, company visits. out in 
the fall term and visit one or two or two or three

18:03.710 --> 18:09.438
plants for a week. Okay. So you learn a lot in a week 
on the ground. Yeah. We would go to different

18:12.342 --> 18:15.266
plants. One time we would go, say, to Port Arthur 
and Beaumont area and we'd take in those plants

18:15.466 --> 18:24.139
over there. Another time, say, we went to East 
Texas and Dallas. We went to the Paper Mill, the

18:33.022 --> 18:39.850
foundry up there in Luckton. Yeah, right. And then 
we went to Dallas and took in, well, we also went to

18:41.031 --> 18:49.961
Mr. Tucker's Foods up in Sherbrooke. And

18:49.981 --> 18:57.008
to make the bridge wall plant in Dallas. And then we 
went as far south as Papa's Crispy. and visited the

19:03.093 --> 19:09.479
Selenese plants down there. And, of course, we 
went down and we'd take in the Houston area quite a

19:09.499 --> 19:15.405
bit. We'd go to Dowell, Selenese, and Bishop, or 
whatever it was. And so we would take in those

19:24.113 --> 19:29.499
plants, and that was very good. The students got to 
look at them. see what was going on. But they don't

19:33.704 --> 19:34.906
do that anymore. And when I was in Ecuador, I took 
the students through the paper mill and the

19:36.448 --> 19:44.520
refinery hall. They had not paper mills, but sugar 
mills. They had two big sugar mills down there.

19:53.513 --> 19:55.155
Yeah, you know, I was kind of reading about 
background on the history of chemical

19:55.625 --> 19:58.048
engineering. One of the first programs in 
chemical engineering was at Tulane University in

19:58.169 --> 20:06.340
New Orleans, and it was sugar, sugar related. Now 
the two that ran the sugar mill, the sugar

20:06.540 --> 20:19.919
operation outside of New Orleans, they were from 
A&M, and they had taken chemical engineering on

20:06.540 --> 20:19.919
them. They owned it. They owned it. He took 
chemical engineering. I don't know whether he

20:25.123 --> 20:29.630
took it here or not. I think he took it here. But I'm 
not sure. And of course, I went into chemical

20:33.295 --> 20:37.061
engineering. That's right. And in fact, what I'm 
going to try to do is do a little flashback in

20:37.562 --> 20:49.219
history and say the basic processes in chemical 
engineering usually have to do with

20:37.562 --> 20:49.219
distillation, fermentation. What else would I 
have to talk about? There used to be a plant, a

20:53.776 --> 20:58.141
company called Commercial Solvents. Did you ever 
hear of it? I want to say I did, but I don't know if I

20:59.803 --> 21:02.005
did or not. Well, they made their solvents by 
fermentation. Yeah. Brutal alcohol, or butyric

21:07.171 --> 21:15.220
acid, or pesticides, different ethyl alcohol, 
all that was made by fermentation. Yeah. And then,

21:15.981 --> 21:21.808
of course, the petroleum products came in, and 
they made ethyl alcohol from petroleum cheaper.

21:22.295 --> 21:37.416
And these solvents were synthesized from 
petroleum byproducts, we'll say, from ethylene

21:22.295 --> 21:37.416
and propylene and methyl alcohol and carbon 
monoxide and so forth. They were all made cheaper

21:37.436 --> 21:40.941
from petroleum than by fermentation. Now, I know 
way back, they were going to use ethyl alcohol in

21:42.102 --> 21:49.753
gasoline. in Iowa, years when I was up there. We had 
been going practically nothing but buy alcohol

21:53.733 --> 22:01.786
and put it in our gasoline. Well, I put it in my 
radiator. That made good sense too, didn't it?

22:07.755 --> 22:08.516
Yeah. It was the nature. But, uh, well Doc Sweeney 
was trying to get them to make alcohol with corn.

22:19.062 --> 22:22.186
You can make two and a half gallons per bushel of 
corn. Well, that made it much more expensive than

22:23.268 --> 22:29.817
making it for patrol from that point. So that's how 
the chemical industry began to develop. We had the

22:34.223 --> 22:47.601
basics like alkali, chlorine, sulfur and 
sulfuric acid, all of those, and fertilizers,

22:34.223 --> 22:47.601
phosphoric acid. began to grow here. Yeah. So 
that's kind of what I was, that all of these

22:52.897 --> 23:04.373
processes of this daily life sort of conglomerate 
and provide the basic impetus for chemical

22:52.897 --> 23:04.373
engineering here. It might have been a little more 
agriculture maybe than in other places, but

23:04.773 --> 23:15.708
petroleum here, agriculture here, I guess would 
be the big impetus to it. But then... These are

23:17.197 --> 23:21.885
basic processes that are used everywhere, and 
they'll always be used. One thing that did help was

23:21.905 --> 23:36.349
during the war when Dow came down here and made 
metal

23:21.905 --> 23:36.349
magnesium. Okay. And time. I wonder why that 
happened.

23:43.555 --> 23:44.737
What, a shaft? No, I've got a... Magnesium shaft on 
a gun? No, I made a putter out of magnesium that was

23:47.722 --> 23:57.038
made by Dow back in 19... way when they had that 
magnesium. They gave us some slugs of magnesium

23:57.058 --> 24:08.398
and they laid in the department for a long time and I 
cut a piece off and made a putter head and I've used

23:57.058 --> 24:08.398
it ever since. But anyway... Well, that's awful 
light. It's really light. It's a big head. That's

24:13.960 --> 24:17.043
why I like it. It's a high putter. I'm not a golfer, 
but they're going back to that big head. I don't

24:20.046 --> 24:23.909
know what they're using in those big putters now. 
One reason for the big head, I guess, is the entire

24:24.029 --> 24:29.934
moment of immersion. You don't... If you hit it a 
little off center, why, it doesn't hurt the top so

24:31.035 --> 24:39.323
much. But...

24:42.989 --> 24:57.167
there you've got fiberglass you've got so much in 
the way of polymers yeah after they i got part of it

24:42.989 --> 24:57.167
well i tell you what i like
