00:02.528 --> 00:09.078
Bob Collins, who served as a member of the SEAL 
Squad in Vietnam from the years 1971 to 1974. Okay,

00:09.319 --> 00:15.068
Mr. Collins, you served in Vietnam from 1971 until 
1974. Can you tell me why you volunteered and what

00:16.170 --> 00:23.421
influences initiated you to volunteer?

00:26.086 --> 00:26.967
Well, I think Part of the main reason is my 
grandfather was in the Navy and my father was in the

00:28.212 --> 00:32.336
Navy. I had several uncles that were in the Navy. 
That's why I went Navy.

00:38.821 --> 00:42.144
The draft really didn't come into play. I had 
volunteered a year before I even graduated from

00:42.544 --> 00:50.851
high school, so that didn't have any influence. 
With all of what was going on in Vietnam,

00:58.182 --> 01:06.491
I guess the fear of living under a communistic rule 
was the

00:58.182 --> 01:06.491
biggest fear. When you're in high school, most of 
the time you don't think about those things. But

01:11.277 --> 01:19.266
Vietnam was becoming real

01:11.277 --> 01:19.266
relevant to us, the guys that were in high school. 
And we started thinking about it.

01:24.946 --> 01:45.135
I just didn't feel like living, even hearing and 
reading what I had read about communism, I didn't

01:24.946 --> 01:45.135
feel like living under that setting and whatever I 
felt like that I could do to combat that was...

01:45.155 --> 01:45.836
Okay. There were a lot of protests going on during 
that time also around 1970. How did you regard the

01:51.465 --> 01:53.147
protests? Well, when I was... I really didn't pay 
any attention to them until I got to Vietnam. And we

02:02.969 --> 02:18.709
would read about them in Stars and Stripes, from 
letters that we got from home about how this... And

02:02.969 --> 02:18.709
mainly it was college students on the campuses 
rioting and protesting for our benefit. And I... a

02:24.228 --> 02:52.885
lot of us had the attitude is how could they know 
without being there and knowing what our thoughts

02:24.228 --> 02:52.885
and our feelings were how could they sit over here 
on a college campus and riot for something that

02:24.228 --> 02:52.885
they knew nothing about you know we felt like you 
know coming back and knocking a few heads trying to

02:24.228 --> 02:52.885
get them to understand that we were there fighting 
for them so that they could be free to do what they

02:24.228 --> 02:52.885
were doing you know if it wasn't for the guys that 
have fought in all the wars, we would probably be

02:54.586 --> 03:03.779
under a socialist-type government or a 
communistic government. And they wouldn't have

03:04.019 --> 03:05.681
the freedom to do that. But yet, they were over here 
rioting

03:06.482 --> 03:17.858
against the liberties that we were trying to 
supply them with or to keep them with. It made us

03:19.300 --> 03:21.623
mad. From the time you volunteered until the day 
you arrived in Vietnam, describe to me what type of

03:21.738 --> 03:39.224
training or education you received about the 
Vietnamese people, their religion, their

03:21.738 --> 03:39.224
country in general, and just basically what 
training you received, military, etc. Well,

03:41.127 --> 03:49.500
that's where I really came to an appreciation of 
the Navy is you sit through... daytime classes. I

03:50.996 --> 03:58.785
mean, you go through eight hours over the class a 
day in

03:50.996 --> 03:58.785
the classroom setting. And then you do, or we had to 
go through jungle tactic training, where it got us

04:00.827 --> 04:10.558
used to fighting in jungle. Where was that 
training held? In San Diego. Well, along the coast

04:16.124 --> 04:18.627
of San Diego and Mexico. We used to have to,

04:19.501 --> 04:30.412
every morning you go out and your CO is out there. 
And there's a raft that weighs about 300 pounds.

04:38.659 --> 04:42.303
And so you have to put it up on your shoulders and 
carry it down to the beach. But it's weird as he's

04:43.424 --> 04:46.487
sitting in it. And he's yelling at you and 
screaming at you. But everything that they did,

04:49.284 --> 04:53.369
you know, they were real tough.

04:56.274 --> 05:01.120
But because of their toughness, it helped keep us 
alive. Well, what I was asking you earlier also is,

05:02.562 --> 05:10.594
did you receive any type of education about the 
Vietnamese people or their religion or anything?

05:10.654 --> 05:12.316
Did you know anything about it before you got 
there? Not really. That was not our job. That was

05:15.880 --> 05:18.864
for the diplomats. Our job was to be an aggressor 
and get a job done. We weren't there to try to

05:29.298 --> 05:36.607
further relations with the North Vietnamese 
people. We were there to do a job. whether it was to

05:40.400 --> 05:46.646
blow up a bridge or whether it was to get secret 
documents or to kidnap or to assassinate. We were

05:46.686 --> 05:50.790
there to do a job and it was not a diplomatic job. It 
was a military job. Okay. Can you describe for me a

05:53.573 --> 06:03.162
little bit about what a SEAL is and what it took to 
become one, how your team worked and what your role

05:53.573 --> 06:03.162
was as a member of that team? Well, I was, the SEALs 
are, I would say the most unique fighting group in

06:08.817 --> 06:12.901
the world. There's an aggressor squad with the 
British, I understand now. They have an aggressor

06:19.067 --> 06:28.496
company that are basically about the same as the 
SEALs. The SEALs are the frogmen. I don't know if

06:30.138 --> 06:35.483
you've ever seen any movies about the frogmen and 
what they did. or do in military operations, but we

06:36.340 --> 06:47.318
worked in four-man teams, and each individual had 
a job to do.

06:51.145 --> 06:53.128
This is the way it was set up with our team. I was a 
protector. I was there to, or we all really Like

07:01.248 --> 07:04.252
when you hit the beach, each man turns his back 
toward the other one. So you have a perimeter. You

07:08.337 --> 07:09.739
got each man looking out. And you go in like that. 
And you're each protecting each other. But in the

07:14.065 --> 07:22.816
setting of explosives or setting a perimeter 
watch, that's where I was called a protector. And I

07:22.856 --> 07:28.183
would make sure that the rest of the team was able to 
get away with whatever we were sent to do. What

07:33.585 --> 07:34.606
about the other members? What were their jobs? 
Well, you have an explosives man. If you're going

07:38.051 --> 07:47.242
in to blow up a bridge, you have a setter, which 
would set the explosives, and then a timer. This

07:48.003 --> 07:49.845
guy would go and set timers.

07:55.932 --> 07:57.394
What was the fourth man? Like, I would stay on the 
outer perimeter, and the other guy would stay on

07:57.695 --> 08:03.842
the inside. If I got wiped out, well, then there 
would still be one more man to protect it. The main

08:09.369 --> 08:13.373
objective was just do the mission, get the mission 
accomplished. And if it was, they would have to go

08:14.355 --> 08:22.584
through two of us to

08:14.355 --> 08:22.584
take out the explosives men. So it was a lot of what A

08:28.627 --> 08:46.970
lot of the real detailed stuff,

08:28.627 --> 08:46.970
it would take probably hours to tell you what 
exactly we did and how we did it. Even on a mission

08:48.772 --> 08:56.862
where we would have to go in and take someone 
prisoner, a high ranking officer or whatever, Our

08:58.428 --> 09:09.523
training was a lot more extensive than any other 
area, because we went on missions in North Vietnam

08:58.428 --> 09:09.523
only. We didn't go to South Vietnam.

09:16.613 --> 09:25.785
So the training,

09:16.613 --> 09:25.785
I I guess I would go through it again if I had to. It's 
not something that I would just like to do every

09:31.541 --> 09:40.432
day, though, because it was pretty rough. 
Describe for me what a usual day would be like.

09:44.657 --> 09:48.482
Well, it all depends on the day.

09:52.987 --> 09:53.528
Normally, Are you talking about basic training, 
or are you talking about in Vietnam? In Vietnam. In

09:56.985 --> 09:58.367
Vietnam.

10:00.769 --> 10:02.211
It's a 24-hour day. When we go on a mission, you 
don't sleep.

10:08.457 --> 10:12.702
You don't rest until your mission's 
accomplished. I remember one

10:12.722 --> 10:19.689
mission that we went on lasted about 36 hours. That 
was a normal day. So you really can't set it in a

10:23.444 --> 10:30.154
setting of a day. This is what my daily work was. 
Because each thing that we were set to do was so

10:36.343 --> 10:42.331
individualistic. It was in a setting of its own. 
Whether it was to go into the hardest The hardest

10:50.596 --> 10:59.513
one was the assassinations, when we were sent in to 
eliminate one person in particular. Such as?

11:04.663 --> 11:10.715
Well, there was a...

11:10.735 --> 11:11.997
I wish I could remember his name.

11:16.381 --> 11:18.443
I can't remember his name. Probably good that I 
can't remember his name. There was a colonel that

11:22.288 --> 11:40.227
was

11:22.288 --> 11:40.227
in charge

11:22.288 --> 11:40.227
of tactical in the North Vietnam.

11:40.247 --> 11:41.629
I can't remember if it was a tank.

11:45.575 --> 11:46.896
We were sent in to get this guy. He was a North 
Vietnamese guy? Yeah. That's all. That's all that

11:51.901 --> 11:57.386
we dealt with was North Vietnamese.

11:57.406 --> 12:06.514
The only time I saw South Vietnamese

11:57.406 --> 12:06.514
was when I was in the hospital. That's the only time 
I saw South Vietnamese. But the planning of trying

12:10.237 --> 12:15.582
to get to one person, especially when they're so 
well protected, Because these guys were really

12:16.456 --> 12:20.361
well protected.

12:23.606 --> 12:34.681
Sometimes it would take days for us to... We'd have 
to burrow in sometimes and stay for 24, 48 hours in a

12:23.606 --> 12:34.681
hole somewhere just waiting to have the 
opportunity. Because we had to go in not only with

12:35.142 --> 12:40.809
the idea of getting this guy, but with the idea of 
getting out. And it was not a suicide mission for

12:42.151 --> 12:45.636
us. because we wanted to stay alive too. But the 
objective was to get this guy and to get out alive.

12:52.867 --> 12:59.500
So sometimes it would take four days to get to 
somebody that we were sent at. What else was a

13:01.925 --> 13:07.776
normal day

13:01.925 --> 13:07.776
besides assassinations?

13:15.113 --> 13:17.075
Stealing documents.

13:20.819 --> 13:26.245
I guess the easiest things to do was to blow things 
up. Such as? Well, a bridge across a river where

13:29.048 --> 13:39.399
they're transporting

13:29.048 --> 13:39.399
weapons or food or whatever to their front lines. 
No.

13:44.344 --> 13:44.985
Basically,

13:47.902 --> 13:56.276
Got to understand that the

13:47.902 --> 13:56.276
North Vietnamese were probably the best jungle 
fighters ever, ever, ever. And so they could

13:57.538 --> 14:04.850
construct a bridge in 12 hours. We could blow it up 
at night when they were transporting stuff. And by

14:10.179 --> 14:12.863
the next evening, it would be right back up again. 
And a lot of times it was just made out of heavy

14:13.889 --> 14:16.953
bamboo. But it was made well enough. We have CVs, 
construction builders, in our services. But

14:25.204 --> 14:33.215
these guys could just go through the jungle and 
construct bridges made out of bamboo better than

14:25.204 --> 14:33.215
some of our steel bridges. You could drive tanks 
across them.

14:39.383 --> 14:41.145
So it was always a constant. blow this up, blow that 
up, get rid of this. We could stop their supply line

14:44.992 --> 14:50.781
for just a small amount of time, it was good. Did you 
take prisoners very often? Only the ones we were

14:55.489 --> 14:56.611
sent to get. You took a prisoner or shot them? Who? 
The people we were after? Yeah.

15:09.577 --> 15:13.162
If we were sent to get them, we never lost anybody we 
were sent in to get. If we were sent to take them

15:13.944 --> 15:16.047
prisoner, we took them prisoner. If we were sent to

15:17.569 --> 15:24.299
kill them, then we did. If we look at our losses in 
Vietnam, the 55,000 men, that's

15:26.102 --> 15:37.980
not even close to the price that the North 
Vietnamese paid. And I think that's what

15:39.344 --> 15:50.295
gets to me the most is we cry over the 55,000 men.

15:54.980 --> 16:02.508
But the idea, the whole, I don't know, the whole 
American idea seemed to have been lost. We just

16:04.591 --> 16:08.895
stopped wanting to win and to stop them. And 
eventually, they won out. And that is the most

16:12.381 --> 16:19.048
degrading thing of all. When we went in, we should 
have gone in to get the job done. In World War II,

16:22.591 --> 16:35.203
when they were going in to free Paris or Rome or to 
really go into Germany itself,

16:37.225 --> 16:45.438
Their attitude, their idea in the American people 
was to stamp out the aggressiveness of Hitler. And

16:46.079 --> 16:49.384
we as an American people have just seemed to have 
lost that. We don't have that idea anymore. What

16:53.611 --> 16:55.754
sort of losses did your SEAL team take? Well, of all 
the time I was there, We lost one man

17:02.116 --> 17:08.623
for hearing problems. And we lost one CO, a 
commanding officer. And we lost one other all the

17:17.733 --> 17:23.138
time that I was there. Two of them were killed and 
one of them was sent home? Mm-hmm. OK. How much did

17:29.538 --> 17:32.262
your training help in your actual performance of 
duty?

17:39.552 --> 17:42.096
Kept me alive more than once. If it hadn't been, I 
think if it hadn't been for the training, I ran into

17:44.139 --> 17:49.306
a booby trap one time. And if it hadn't been for the 
training, I probably would have been

17:59.592 --> 18:03.416
The whole idea behind booby traps in Vietnam was 
not to kill you. It was just to maim you. And I hit one

18:06.380 --> 18:11.426
that was supposed to come up into my face. It was 
bamboo strips. And

18:15.010 --> 18:25.482
because of the alertness and the quickness that 
you learn in training, I was able to protect

18:27.267 --> 18:28.988
myself. I had 408 stitches in my arms where the 
bamboo cut into my arms instead of into my face.

18:38.897 --> 18:41.960
That's one example.

18:47.605 --> 18:57.173
It got to where, after a while, if we didn't,

18:47.605 --> 18:57.173
not that killing is something that you like to do, 
But that was our job. And the training that we went

19:01.574 --> 19:08.301
through, we were supposed to be, we were there to 
kill the enemy. What time of day was the most active

19:10.783 --> 19:12.966
for y'all? Oh, nighttime. Always nighttime. How 
would you describe the Vietnam spiders?

19:24.817 --> 19:26.159
I mean, the Viet Cong spiders. Very good. 
Excellent. As far as jungle fighting, open

19:31.452 --> 19:40.542
fighting, I don't think they would probably be as 
good as the American. But as far as jungle

19:40.602 --> 19:50.473
fighting, probably just as good as the Japanese in 
World War II, if not better. Who did you receive

19:51.795 --> 19:53.216
your orders from? And by that I mean, where did they 
originate from? Sink Pack Fleet. And who's

19:58.865 --> 20:01.508
commander of that?

20:07.874 --> 20:08.755
Maybe many. Admiral?

20:17.744 --> 20:18.805
Station in Hawaii?

20:22.689 --> 20:23.370
I don't know.

20:28.666 --> 20:32.132
I can't remember the guys. I'm real bad on names.

20:40.905 --> 20:42.208
He was commander of what again? What was it? The 
Pacific Fleet. Okay. What is your opinion about

20:50.924 --> 20:56.632
careerism in the military during Vietnam? Did it 
exist in your opinion? And by that I mean the

20:58.474 --> 21:05.924
commanding officers being there just as kind of a 
plus on their record. I

21:05.944 --> 21:17.640
don't think we had, I don't think that the guys that 
went over there, you mean as young officers

21:05.944 --> 21:17.640
wanting to make a career? I mean, up to generals and 
stuff like that. The records that I've seen, at

21:22.899 --> 21:30.952
least in the Marines and stuff, were that there 
were only like three generals killed and two of

21:22.899 --> 21:30.952
them were in accidents. And so, I mean, it was 
mainly, you know, the GIs that were up there

21:32.754 --> 21:42.710
fighting, doing the fighting, and the generals 
were, you know, off somewhere in a secure place.

21:43.070 --> 21:44.392
Well, that's as in all wars. You know, how many 
generals were killed in World War II? On World War

21:49.227 --> 21:56.036
I,

21:49.227 --> 21:56.036
the general is not there to get out and pull the 
trigger. It's just like the idea of a manager

21:57.638 --> 22:01.884
somewhere. It's not what he can do. It's what he can 
get others to do for him.

22:08.072 --> 22:18.306
So I have absolutely no problem with the number of 
high-ranking officers that were killed because

22:08.072 --> 22:18.306
that's not their job. Their job is to think, and our 
job was the job to, you know. Did you respect your

22:25.869 --> 22:27.071
leaders? I did, yes. Okay. Tell me about the role 
the Russians played in the war, based on what you

22:32.640 --> 22:35.965
saw.

22:38.789 --> 22:45.880
Well, we went very far north, and I guess contrary 
to popular belief that, you know,

22:48.475 --> 22:55.042
The

22:48.475 --> 22:55.042
North Vietnamese were actually fighting two 
fronts. They were fighting aggression from the

22:56.524 --> 22:59.367
Chinese on one front. And that's only because the 
North Vietnamese,

23:00.589 --> 23:09.018
which was stupid, they became aggressive to the 
Chinese. And the Chinese weren't going to put up

23:10.099 --> 23:13.403
with that.

23:14.463 --> 23:24.137
and then against the American in the

23:14.463 --> 23:24.137
South Vietnamese. On the other front, the 
Russians not only supplies, I never saw actual

23:24.838 --> 23:40.761
troops flooding in, but they did have military 
advisors. Advisors in the north? Oh, yeah,

23:42.884 --> 23:44.166
training. you know, in weaponry. And just like we 
do when we go in somewhere, just like it started in

23:47.977 --> 23:55.948
Vietnam with us, you know, we sent in military 
advisors.

23:58.852 --> 24:08.966
Of course, the Russians never had to pull troops 
into Vietnam as we did because they had the

23:58.852 --> 24:08.966
advantage.

24:11.710 --> 24:13.613
They knew what they were fighting for. They were 
fighting to take over South Vietnam and make

24:14.740 --> 24:26.733
Vietnam a communistic-run country, and they kept 
that idea. We went in with the idea of freeing

24:27.453 --> 24:38.385
Vietnam, and we lost it somewhere. The Russians, 
as far as instilling into the minds of the people,

24:38.737 --> 24:51.633
they did a real good job. You had told me that you 
killed a Russian advisor. That was the highlight

24:55.699 --> 24:57.821
of your time there. Tell me about that. Well, we 
went in just to get some documents, some maps,

25:10.546 --> 25:27.523
We got a lot of our information on transportation 
routes, troop movements,

25:10.546 --> 25:27.523
mine areas, from what we could steal from the Viet 
Cong.

25:29.625 --> 25:39.034
And

25:29.625 --> 25:39.034
we just went in to get some information

25:41.225 --> 25:46.753
military advisor was there, and he just happened 
to wake up at the wrong time. So it was, and it's not

25:48.316 --> 25:52.642
the idea of killing a Russian. I guess I really 
wanted to kill an idea.

26:02.217 --> 26:06.523
Because to me that they represent

26:07.820 --> 26:10.704
communism and socialism to the fullest extent. 
And if I could do anything to smash that idea, I was

26:11.445 --> 26:15.830
that much more ahead. That was probably the 
highlight of my Vietnam experience anyway. I

26:24.682 --> 26:26.044
can't say that it was fun. Taking the life of 
another human being is not fun. But it sure made it a

26:31.971 --> 26:35.616
lot easier knowing who he was.

26:38.431 --> 26:39.953
Tell me about the day that you were wounded.

26:42.636 --> 27:07.527
It

26:42.636 --> 27:07.527
was a mistake on our part because

26:42.636 --> 27:07.527
we went in to observe

26:42.636 --> 27:07.527
a lot of troop movement and we never Got into open 
area. And I don't know how it happened that day, but

27:11.538 --> 27:20.226
we were walking right out in the middle of a rice 
field. And, I mean, snipers were always, I mean,

27:20.246 --> 27:26.632
always killing our guys. Not the SEALs, but 
American troops. I mean, the snipers were real,

27:30.015 --> 27:34.259
real good at what they did. And we probably lost 
more lives from snipers than anything else. from

27:40.025 --> 27:42.948
bombs or fire fights or anything. Snipers 
probably kills most of our men. But

27:46.411 --> 27:53.216
all of a sudden we heard shots fired and the CO went 
down.

27:56.159 --> 27:58.201
And we just started firing everywhere. I

27:59.682 --> 28:08.850
did a stupid thing as I went to I went to get Garcia. 
And

28:14.478 --> 28:22.546
when I was about halfway to him, we heard shots 
again. And I was running. And I got hit in the leg, in

28:26.849 --> 28:32.495
the ankle first, and then the leg. And he just kept 
firing. The other guys got his location, and we

28:40.808 --> 28:46.937
called out to a ship that was out in the harbor. And 
he fired in and blew the tree that this sniper was

28:48.279 --> 28:55.589
in. Just blew it with a five-inch gun. Just blew it 
all. It went up in a pile of smoke. But by that time, I

29:04.261 --> 29:10.410
had already been pretty much wasted by then. They 
got me out. The CO had been shot in the head. He was

29:15.545 --> 29:16.066
dead. But they got me out. Where else did you have 
wounds? Besides your leg, anyone? Stomach,

29:22.759 --> 29:26.045
shoulder, and arm. And what happened to the guy 
that was shooting you? Well, I'm sure he's dead.

29:30.293 --> 29:33.900
They found pieces of the arm. The other guy found 
just the pieces of the rifle that he was using, an

29:34.201 --> 29:43.476
AK-47, which is a real well-made Russian weapon. 
And

29:44.979 --> 29:55.336
we reconstructed it and dedicated it to the ship 
that fired the round. So they hung it up in their

29:56.819 --> 30:00.124
galley in a glass case.

30:02.686 --> 30:04.509
Tell me about the day that you were captured. Oh, 
that was a joke. We got information that we were

30:09.278 --> 30:25.588
supposed to go in and, again, just make 
observations and see who was there, how many, the

30:09.278 --> 30:25.588
strength of the Viet Cong. We went in and found out 
it was American Fifth Army was in there. So we just

30:33.148 --> 30:35.711
walked in. Well, they thought we were, you have to 
understand, I understand their motives for

30:37.093 --> 30:45.403
taking us prisoners. They thought we were spies.

30:53.634 --> 30:57.178
Because we don't carry any, SEALs don't carry any 
ID. You know, they're going in.

31:03.291 --> 31:05.975
What sort of uniform did you wear? Normally a black 
turtleneck sweater with black gabardine pants

31:05.995 --> 31:20.078
and jungle boots and as many explosives and 
weapons as we could. Why didn't they recognize you

31:20.716 --> 31:22.999
as Americans? Well, there are no markings or 
anything. You don't have any kind of markings on

31:24.941 --> 31:29.046
you at all as to manufacturer or anything. So as far 
as they knew, what had happened is in between the

31:30.168 --> 31:42.503
time when we got our orders to go in, the North Viet 
Cong had backed off. And Fifth Army had moved in to

31:44.365 --> 31:49.491
the position where the Viet Cong were supposed to 
have been. So when we went in there, you know, we

31:49.876 --> 32:03.376
just found the Fifth Army and walked in and we could 
have, you know, been spies or... Russian spies.

32:03.396 --> 32:03.797
Russians. Or just about anybody. So I understand. 
How long were you held and what did it take to get you

32:11.168 --> 32:13.892
released? Well, it got a little aggravating. 
After 10 days, we became pretty upset. They

32:23.467 --> 32:24.689
treated us real well. They kept joking around 
about sending us over to the Koreans. The Koreans

32:29.977 --> 32:38.850
are probably the best people to get information 
out of prisoners of war.

32:40.518 --> 33:02.680
Finally,

32:40.518 --> 33:02.680
the admiral that was aboard, I can't remember 
which carrier it was, one of the carriers that was

32:40.518 --> 33:02.680
there, admiral that was aboard that carrier, had 
to come in in ideas to get us out. It took 10 days?

33:05.343 --> 33:10.288
Actually, it was like 15 days in total. But they 
treated us well. They fed us real good.

33:17.678 --> 33:19.140
It was mainly the heckling. They were giving us a 
hard time.

33:25.487 --> 33:27.429
They sincerely believed that you were Russians? 
I'm not sure. They had some wacko officers in

33:29.431 --> 33:34.817
there. You've got to understand the Army.

33:40.243 --> 33:41.524
I don't know if they... thought it was a joke. To us, 
it wasn't a very good joke because we still had a job

33:45.327 --> 33:52.317
to do. If they would have really been sincere about 
turning us over to the Koreans,

33:52.437 --> 34:10.363
there probably would have been a few of them taken 
out in the attempt.

34:11.744 --> 34:17.591
Okay, tell me some more about some other 
operations you went on.

34:17.611 --> 34:19.273
Any other incidents like that? Did you ever come 
close to getting captured by the North

34:19.373 --> 34:24.819
Vietnamese? Oh, no. No.

34:35.431 --> 34:38.595
It may sound funny, but you need to understand that 
that when you're in a fighting group like this,

34:39.655 --> 34:47.307
that you're just kind of like a machine, you know. 
We had gone up against 30, 40 at a time here in Conk,

34:48.329 --> 35:01.370
and it

34:48.329 --> 35:01.370
was killing. You know, so the...

35:07.499 --> 35:10.242
The odds were always in our favor. They were real 
sneaky in jungle maneuvers, but so were we. Over

35:19.051 --> 35:31.724
the regular GI Joe that goes in,

35:19.051 --> 35:31.724
they had the advantage.

35:32.004 --> 35:35.548
The Army, the Marine Corps,

35:38.971 --> 35:42.416
did not really train enough in jungle. And we still 
don't train today enough in jungle warfare. If we

35:46.862 --> 35:57.616
get into a conflict in Central America, our men are 
still going to be not equipped in jungle warfare.

35:59.139 --> 36:01.562
And we do not spend enough time. We're so ancient. 
You send a guy in with 100 pounds on his back, a

36:05.887 --> 36:16.901
shovel and a pick and all this junk on his back that 
is useless in jungle warfare. You can't do that to a

36:18.083 --> 36:19.345
man. You take a North Vietnamese capture,

36:27.267 --> 36:31.191
which was rare, because they'd just rather die 
than be captured. But the ones that were captured,

36:31.332 --> 36:42.664
they'd have just a handful of rice and just as many 
weapons as they could carry. We'd load our guys

36:42.704 --> 36:48.991
down in jungle warfare. You can't do that. We're 
just behind the times.

36:54.875 --> 37:00.641
We started blowing our troops out around 1972, and 
you stayed until 74. Why was that? Well,

37:04.586 --> 37:22.806
I remember like in 1970, 1972,

37:04.586 --> 37:22.806
we mined Haiphong Harbor, President Nixon did, to 
cut off supplies to the North Vietnamese, the

37:04.586 --> 37:22.806
ships that were going in. So

37:24.271 --> 37:36.845
militarily, we were still, just because we 
started pulling out a few troops, there were

37:24.271 --> 37:36.845
always troops coming back and forth. And I'm

37:36.985 --> 37:53.704
not going to say it was a hype put over by the press or 
even the White House, but we were pretty much still

37:36.985 --> 37:53.704
at full strength over there. We weren't in full 
enough strength to get the job done.

38:03.750 --> 38:06.274
Did you receive any medals when you were in 
Vietnam?

38:09.660 --> 38:09.940
Yeah. Yeah, I got a few. How do you view them?

38:24.042 --> 38:27.006
I'm very, well, I'll put it this way. I'm very proud 
of the uniform that I wore and it doesn't bother me a

38:27.046 --> 38:36.237
bit to put it on in Veterans Day and Memorial Day.

38:42.705 --> 38:48.833
The medals that are on it are to me just a 
recognition of a job well done.

38:53.038 --> 38:53.779
They might be given by the military. I have a 
presidential citation that I got from President

38:56.751 --> 39:00.576
Nixon. But

39:02.098 --> 39:07.365
I'm proud of him. I did the best that I could do to 
stamp out what I hate the most. If our government

39:18.515 --> 39:26.708
wants to give me a medal to pin on my chest because of 
it, then I'll accept that.

39:31.456 --> 39:33.659
Why do you think we lost the war in Vietnam? If you 
were to place the blame on somebody, who would you

39:34.421 --> 39:39.328
place it on? The American public.

39:42.874 --> 39:45.298
I think the attitude of the American public

39:47.860 --> 39:50.503
lost the war in Vietnam. Did you feel we were 
justified in going over there in the first place?

39:53.968 --> 39:54.429
Definitely. I think any time a government asks us 
to come in because they feel a threat of communism

39:55.090 --> 40:06.665
in their back door,

39:55.090 --> 40:06.665
it justifies it.

40:10.189 --> 40:12.112
Any other reasons why you thought we lost the war? 
Anything to do with the military tactics you used?

40:18.320 --> 40:20.764
failures in command or anything?

40:26.291 --> 40:33.021
Did you feel like the South Vietnamese people had a 
real desire to fight the North Vietnamese? Oh,

40:33.662 --> 40:34.543
definitely. They still do. There's still a war 
going on in Vietnam.

40:41.934 --> 40:46.200
The majority, I think the majority of the South 
Vietnamese that I came in contact with just a few

40:46.990 --> 40:50.835
that I did, but you can talk to them. I went to 
Washington D.C.

40:51.837 --> 41:02.912
two years ago and there was a big delegation of 
South Vietnamese people there.

41:05.997 --> 41:10.483
They were having a big rally there to 
anti-establishment, anti-involvement in

41:12.910 --> 41:17.395
Central America. And they were comparing our 
involvement in Central America to our

41:17.455 --> 41:25.205
involvement in Vietnam, which is unfair. And 
there were a lot of Vietnamese people there that as

41:26.907 --> 41:38.260
military, they They didn't have anything to do 
with the people that were protesting against our

41:39.320 --> 41:46.008
involvement because they appreciated what we did 
for them. And it was a sincere appreciation of what

41:47.891 --> 41:51.575
we were there for. They couldn't do it on their own. 
They asked us for help. We went in and helped them as

41:55.440 --> 41:57.342
much as we could. The attitude of the American 
people, especially when it gets back to the GI, the

41:57.382 --> 42:06.053
guy that's fighting, you know, And I have to 
compare it to World War II, because what else do we

42:07.417 --> 42:12.363
have to compare it with?

42:14.946 --> 42:33.407
How do you think it would have went over if 
everything that the guys over there were fighting

42:14.946 --> 42:33.407
about,

42:14.946 --> 42:33.407
if everything that they heard was negative, that 
they were dogs and they were pigs and they were baby

42:14.946 --> 42:33.407
killers? We had no business there. No, the 
American people in World War II backed what we were

42:36.382 --> 42:42.772
doing because of the aggression of Hitler. Hitler 
was not communist, but the idea of his aggression

42:43.873 --> 42:57.133
is what we were trying to stamp out, taking over 
other people's.

43:00.269 --> 43:09.320
I think it was the letdown, you know, when you get 
bombarded and that's all you hear is how the

43:00.269 --> 43:09.320
American people dislike what you're doing. It 
gives you a real insecure sense, you know,

43:10.261 --> 43:14.467
feeling. And that's what we got when we were in 
Vietnam was, you know, college students

43:14.827 --> 43:22.817
protesting.

43:23.995 --> 43:30.621
guys going on military trial for doing a job that 
they were sent to do.

43:32.203 --> 43:42.753
It was real hard to come back to the United States 
with a sense of job well done. I mean, nobody

43:43.033 --> 43:51.741
has ever said thank you for protecting my 
liberties.

43:59.475 --> 44:00.702
Continued on side two.
