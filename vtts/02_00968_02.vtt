WEBVTT

00:01.347 --> 00:14.803
a sit-in vigil at the Minnesota State Capitol over 
Thanksgiving Day where we fasted and conducted a

00:01.347 --> 00:14.803
memorial prayer. One of the local peace activists 
and clergy and laymen concerned, a Lutheran

00:15.463 --> 00:29.920
minister from Minneapolis came over and we prayed 
and the television cameras came and we got good

00:15.463 --> 00:29.920
press. And we were generally trying to do those 
less obtrusive things. And we felt like we were

00:36.610 --> 00:45.419
reaching a greater number of people, because they 
wanted to sit down and talk with us, because that's

00:36.610 --> 00:45.419
the image we carefully radiated. Well, having 
mentioned the election, it's been said that

00:46.781 --> 00:54.229
McGovern was the anti-war candidate and had the 
support of the anti-war movement. Does that hold

00:54.249 --> 01:00.396
true with the Vietnam Vets Against the War, at 
least in your region? Hubert Humphrey was his main

01:00.578 --> 01:06.727
opponent for the Democratic nomination that 
year. Hubert's from the Twin Cities. Hubert's

01:08.950 --> 01:13.417
been a long time strong DFL person. What's a DFL? 
Democrat Farmer Labor. The Democratic Party in

01:17.443 --> 01:29.961
this area has been called the Democrat Farmer 
Labor for a number of years to indicate its popular

01:17.443 --> 01:29.961
grassroots level support.

01:31.291 --> 01:42.525
A number of veterans felt that in 68, Hubert had 
changed his position of supporting the war and

01:31.291 --> 01:42.525
supporting LBJ. That he was forced into 
supporting LBJ because he was a vice presidential

01:43.487 --> 01:54.901
candidate, because he was a vice president, and he 
believed that the vice president ought to either

01:43.487 --> 01:54.901
be on the president's side or should resign. And so 
there was some support for, among the vets, for

02:00.586 --> 02:08.817
Hubert, but I'd say it was probably 5% of the vets 
who were active in the political caucuses that

02:00.586 --> 02:08.817
year. Otherwise, 95% of the vets, in my 
guesstimation, supported McGovern. And once he

02:14.584 --> 02:21.233
was officially the representative of the 
Democratic Party, did the vets engage in campaign

02:14.584 --> 02:21.233
reform?

02:23.996 --> 02:24.997
Yes, yes. The VVAW organization engaged in in 
campaigning for him. At this time, on the Mankato

02:32.251 --> 02:41.905
State campus, on the university campus, and also 
at a national level, there were two other

02:32.251 --> 02:41.905
veterans' organizations. One had been financed 
by the Republicans, and I don't...

02:41.925 --> 02:54.321
Vietnam Veterans for Peace, or Vietnam 
Veterans... I don't remember what their title is.

02:55.964 --> 02:56.985
I'd have to look that up. But they had the 
three-piece suit, pinstripe person who would go

02:58.265 --> 03:12.042
around and try to heckle us, and do those kind of 
things, and come up with facts and figures. They

03:12.803 --> 03:16.167
were basically a reaction by the Republicans. The 
Republicans established this group, just like

03:17.209 --> 03:23.637
the Dirty Tricks group the Republicans 
established. Like the Hard Hats? Were they Hard

03:26.901 --> 03:27.782
Hats? Yeah. Or I'm saying like the Hardhats. Well, 
like the Hardhats, yes. They just went around on

03:32.838 --> 03:39.368
campus and presented themselves to be college 
students who agreed with the war.

03:42.392 --> 03:47.580
Plus there was a national organization of just 
vets who were attempting to be apolitical.

03:50.064 --> 03:56.233
Did you, by early 73, the BBAW and others sort of 
outlined a platform that always seemed to include

03:56.787 --> 04:03.494
a national campaign for the impeachment of Nixon. 
Did that play a part at all? Now this is getting

04:07.718 --> 04:13.304
close to when maybe you pulled out or when you left 
the VBAW. Well, through the election, through the

04:13.324 --> 04:18.830
election of Carter, I worked with the vets. What 
happened in our area is after Carter was elected,

04:18.950 --> 04:26.338
no one Let's see. Wait a second. I'm sorry. I'm 
getting confused here. After McGovern was so

04:30.176 --> 04:43.170
badly beaten by Nixon, and after the Watergate 
came to a head and Nixon resigned, the

04:30.176 --> 04:43.170
organization basically folded. By that time, 
everyone had experienced burnout. The radicals

04:46.854 --> 04:50.858
in the non- veteran peace organizations had began 
to take over, and the more moderate folks dropped

04:51.243 --> 05:00.237
out. Okay, so with the withdrawal of Nixon then, is 
it just the Minnesota chapter or the five-state

05:01.359 --> 05:10.353
region chapter that folded, or pretty much all 
around? Well, the five-state region in Minnesota

05:11.214 --> 05:19.427
folded, and that was the...

05:19.778 --> 05:22.160
the twilight of the national organization. The

05:22.741 --> 05:33.012
urgency which created the organization had 
diminished, and the organization basically

05:22.741 --> 05:33.012
folded. Well, after all, in 73, the troops, the 
last American troops had already come back, so it

05:33.632 --> 05:43.783
seems to me the major cause, or one of the major 
causes, had already been remedied. Okay. Did

05:46.285 --> 05:46.866
you... Through your time either as a member or as 
regional director, have any feeling that there

05:47.487 --> 05:57.423
might be some FBI infiltration with what was going 
on? Yes, on a number of occasions.

06:02.691 --> 06:13.748
I

06:02.691 --> 06:13.748
believe the first time that I personally 
suspected someone that I was associating with to

06:02.691 --> 06:13.748
be to be a plant of some sort was after a meeting of 
the Mankato area peace organizations over at my

06:14.268 --> 06:26.507
apartment in Mankato. We met early one evening and 
kind of partied on into toward midnight that

06:27.388 --> 06:34.058
night. Got up the next morning and attended 
classes. I came home about noon the next day and

06:37.263 --> 06:41.710
found my back door open. Apparently someone who 
had been at that meeting had unbolted, it was just a

06:42.702 --> 06:58.420
deadbolt, had unbolted the door which was 
positioned behind the refrigerator in the

06:42.702 --> 06:58.420
kitchen. We never used the door and it was just an 
emergency exit to us. They'd unbolted the door and

07:04.447 --> 07:09.553
came back that morning knowing I would be at class. 
because the refrigerator was slightly ajar and

07:10.259 --> 07:14.244
the door was unbolted. The refrigerator had been 
moved about four inches out of place, and I

07:15.626 --> 07:20.692
thought, geez, when did this happen? And I got 
nosing around, didn't think too much of it, moved

07:20.712 --> 07:36.773
the refrigerator back into place, and then I 
noticed that eight to 10, 12 glasses that we'd been

07:20.712 --> 07:36.773
drinking from the evening before were missing, 
and that a ceramic ashtray which I had just

07:37.293 --> 07:44.241
purchased two or three days earlier in 
anticipation of smoking at this meeting, was

07:37.293 --> 07:44.241
missing. And we talked about that with some of the 
other folks in the organization. We decided that

07:52.991 --> 08:06.186
because about a month, three weeks prior to this 
meeting, the regional law enforcement center,

07:52.991 --> 08:06.186
which was being built in Mankato, had been bombed 
one evening. And I guess $120,000 damage

08:06.976 --> 08:12.245
somewhere in that area was done. And the clock that 
was supposedly used to time the blast had been the

08:13.226 --> 08:22.802
clock that had the Secretary of the Student Senate 
from Mankato State. It was her clock on her desk.

08:26.228 --> 08:31.296
She was the first cousin of my wife. And I had spent a 
lot of time up at the Student Senate, and I had, upon

08:32.305 --> 08:48.688
coming back from Vietnam, I had applied for 
unemployment benefits, and one of the skills that

08:32.305 --> 08:48.688
I'd listed was as a demolition expert. And we began 
to put two and two together, and thought that, you

08:49.389 --> 09:00.625
know, unbeknownst to me, I had become a suspect, 
and that they were looking for fingerprints of the

08:49.389 --> 09:00.625
people that were at the meeting. Another occasion 
was when this person that I suspected to be the

09:01.853 --> 09:14.538
agent, first time I ever laid eyes on him was St. 
Patty's Day of that year, when there were two

09:01.853 --> 09:14.538
campuses. There was an upper campus, which was the 
newer emerging developing campus at Mankato

09:14.558 --> 09:18.867
State, with the lower campus of Old Main and some 
other buildings. There was a bus shuttle system

09:23.407 --> 09:27.852
which shuttled students regularly up and down the 
hill. But hitchhiking was by far the prevalent

09:28.592 --> 09:31.956
means of transportation. And hitchhikers 
generally waited in a certain area to go between

09:32.997 --> 09:37.521
campuses. And as cars would stop, you'd jump in. 
And if there was room, you got in. And you waited

09:41.165 --> 09:43.688
till the next one if it was filled. And this guy hops 
into my van, this person that I later suspected.

09:48.833 --> 09:51.356
And he says, St. Paddy's Day. He said, I'm going to 
go down to Kilkenny, Minnesota, which is where I'm

09:51.376 --> 09:54.759
from. I'm going to go down to Kilkenny, Minnesota 
and have a few beers. That's St. Paddy's Day. I'm

10:02.447 --> 10:04.189
looking for some folks. I'm wondering if 
anybody's going that way. And then this guy, I

10:06.631 --> 10:11.216
bumped shoulders with him pretty regularly 
thereafter. And I think he even played

10:12.016 --> 10:16.981
racquetball with him on a number of occasions. But 
nothing ever came out of that then? Well, I think he

10:18.854 --> 10:20.736
was the operative. And he eventually worked his 
way into a position within the organization. And

10:28.604 --> 10:32.467
everyone kind of didn't know what to think of him. 
They didn't want to suspect him of being an agent

10:32.808 --> 10:39.394
and alienate him if it wasn't true. And we didn't 
have any hard evidence. And he really wasn't

10:42.317 --> 10:44.919
proposing radical things. It just seemed like he 
wanted to gather information And we all thought

10:47.828 --> 10:50.271
that there really wasn't any harm in that. Any 
other occasions? Yeah. Another occasion was when

10:55.376 --> 11:07.289
a gal came up to me, a red-haired gal from out east, 
and she had on hippie bib overhauls. She said she

11:07.489 --> 11:15.878
was driving, she was going out west to live in a 
commune, and her van broke down here in Mankato,

11:07.489 --> 11:15.878
and so she decided to enroll at school. and make 
some money and repair the van. And she was just

11:19.074 --> 11:27.827
really impressed by a speech I'd given that 
morning over at one of the campuses, or schools,

11:19.074 --> 11:27.827
high schools in the area. And could, you know, 
could we talk about it? So we sat down in the Union

11:31.773 --> 11:33.836
and had coffee. And she, you know, indicated that 
she would be enormously pleased if I went over to

11:34.697 --> 11:42.709
her house and got to know her a little better. And I 
was extremely flattered and caught somewhat off

11:43.280 --> 11:54.752
guard and really thought that she was really 
attracted to me. At the end of the conversation,

11:55.493 --> 12:07.525
when I decided not to come over and declined going 
with her, was, well, can you put me in touch with any

11:55.493 --> 12:07.525
Communist Party members here? I'm really into 
this and I want to do my thing on a serious level. And

12:12.980 --> 12:19.406
of course, that was the first opportunity that I'd 
had to really think that there were legitimate

12:12.980 --> 12:19.406
card-carrying commies around.

12:22.669 --> 12:32.398
That summer, this was in the spring of 72, that 
summer, I attended a summer session at Harvard. I

12:32.418 --> 12:40.506
happened to be sitting in a Zum Zum's coffee ice 
cream sandwich parlor, about a half of a block off

12:41.043 --> 12:59.918
of Harvard Square, and I saw her come in and 
purchase an ice cream cone, and she had on an

12:41.043 --> 12:59.918
expensive tweed, very British, English, 
Harvard, Bostonian, well-to-do suit, and she was

12:41.043 --> 12:59.918
doing something at Harvard. I was going to 
approach her and say, hey, how are you doing, and I

13:00.599 --> 13:03.625
thought, God, if it just appears that she was into 
something and I don't know who she was, maybe they

13:04.465 --> 13:11.777
don't know I'm here. I don't want to cause any 
trouble. Speaking of communists, some suggest

13:15.663 --> 13:25.680
that there was a pro-communist, pro-North 
Vietnam element in the anti-war movement. Yes. In

13:29.530 --> 13:33.675
the Minnesota region, that was clearly not true. 
We were populists who believed in the

13:33.695 --> 13:42.244
Constitution and in the democratic process. And 
we wanted to engage in debates and talk to people

13:42.765 --> 13:50.233
and inform them of our opinion so they could make 
their decisions. because we felt the government

13:51.817 --> 13:55.101
and the military were not giving all the data. On 
the national level, the VVAW members were

13:56.142 --> 14:03.091
infinitely more radical than we were. We withdrew 
because of that. They used the bourgeois

14:05.714 --> 14:10.219
proletariat lingo and jargon. They were 
extremely radical in appearance with the afros,

14:11.641 --> 14:18.870
white guys with the afros and beards. grubby, 
smelly clothes and spouting slogans instead of

14:20.032 --> 14:26.938
engaging in discourse.

14:29.600 --> 14:41.411
We withdrew, and I think John Kerry ultimately got 
out of the organization because we felt that it had

14:29.600 --> 14:41.411
been taken over by people who did not represent 
what we wanted represented, that they were

14:29.600 --> 14:41.411
radical. It was very possible that inside their 
heads they thought they identified with certain

14:41.931 --> 14:48.317
aspects socialist or communist party. I don't 
know that that was the case nationally. Some go so

14:53.555 --> 15:02.027
far as to say that these communist elements were 
actually being directed from Moscow.

15:04.250 --> 15:04.810
I don't know. We suspected that one of the radical 
people on the national board of VVAW was actually

15:05.131 --> 15:13.883
an FBI plant. And he would occasionally propose 
things that I thought were outlandishly radical

15:15.128 --> 15:28.668
and would ultimately be extremely detrimental to 
the peace movement. And the rest of the folks

15:30.030 --> 15:44.190
there, a great number of others, didn't seem to 
have jobs, but yet seemed to be able to fly around

15:30.030 --> 15:44.190
the country and live a live a lifestyle. I don't 
know. I don't know. I've thought about that many

15:48.749 --> 15:54.921
times after that meeting in Kansas City, but I've 
never had any hardcore evidence. Okay. Well,

15:56.785 --> 16:04.440
along with this pro-communist element, Norman 
Podhoretz cites two other themes or elements

16:05.028 --> 16:12.218
comprising the BBAW as well as just anti-war 
movements in general. And one is the

16:13.320 --> 16:17.005
anti-anti-communist attitude. Was that 
prevalent with your group? That is the attitude

16:21.692 --> 16:29.243
that rejects the monolithic communist and is anti 
the better dead than red attitude.

16:31.987 --> 16:32.267
Um... There were certain people in the local 
region who believed that, or who felt that it may

16:33.158 --> 16:43.589
not necessarily be better to be dead than red.

16:46.652 --> 16:49.054
Maybe I didn't make that clear enough. The 
anti-anti-communists, didn't most of you share

16:49.074 --> 17:01.427
that attitude, that over detente spirit, 
rejecting the notion that communism is the world

16:49.074 --> 17:01.427
menace? And that suggests in itself that that 
attitude may have been one of the reasons for

17:02.048 --> 17:07.235
getting into NOM in the first place. I think that 
the prevalent attitude was that communism was not

17:07.996 --> 17:23.837
so monolithic, and that communism was,

17:07.996 --> 17:23.837
but yet communism was generally evil. of some 
nature. But on the other hand, if in a free

17:27.251 --> 17:39.849
democratic election people chose to do things 
that were more philosophically communist, that

17:27.251 --> 17:39.849
was their business. If those folks in other 
countries wanted to live that way, that really was

17:40.390 --> 17:45.718
their business. Okay. And the third gang was an 
anti-American, or sometimes called

17:53.230 --> 17:58.559
anti-imperialist, at least in their terms, 
aspect. Did you find that in your region? Not in the

18:00.542 --> 18:01.925
region. There were occasional people who talked 
that way.

18:09.778 --> 18:11.000
But at the national level? At the national level, 
that was probably the prevalent attitude.

18:14.326 --> 18:16.690
Really? was the terms that they could speak out 
most on. How strongly they identify with any other

18:21.060 --> 18:28.111
political organization such as the Commies, I 
don't know. But anti-imperialism was a big, big

18:28.612 --> 18:31.778
issue. And when that issue was growing, that's 
when you all withdrew then. About that same time?

18:38.911 --> 18:40.774
Yeah. The anti-imperialist issue had been around 
for quite a while, and we basically agreed with

18:40.894 --> 18:50.227
them that we ought not to be imperialist. It was 
just a matter of, is it imperialist to go in and

18:50.868 --> 18:56.757
preserve a democracy? Well, if you read the VBAW 
today, or let's say 1982, they now... went ahead to

19:05.877 --> 19:21.914
attach the anti-imperialist slogan at the end, 
it's no longer the VBAW, but it's the VBAWAI, that

19:05.877 --> 19:21.914
would tend to suggest that most of the 
conservative elements, indeed when you read the

19:05.877 --> 19:21.914
paper, most of the conservative elements are no 
longer there. It's more of an anti-imperialist,

19:22.475 --> 19:29.682
any U.S. action seems to be viewed as an 
imperialist gesture now. Seems a little bit more

19:30.463 --> 19:32.725
like the radicals took over now? Yeah, I think very 
clearly they have. most other people after the

19:35.510 --> 19:43.583
withdrawal of American troops that for whatever 
reasons I've got to get my own personal life in

19:35.510 --> 19:43.583
order. I've got to graduate from college or get my 
job or get back in the swing and start to lead a

19:43.643 --> 19:49.772
normal life. There are very few people who 
continued on in a political vein of this sort

19:49.792 --> 19:57.144
outside of the major parties. Most of us were 
assimilated into attending caucuses and voting

20:00.485 --> 20:07.073
and involving ourselves in some political 
organization. But for about six, eight years, I

20:07.113 --> 20:17.466
heard or read nothing or had no contact with any 
organization of VBAW. And this latest

20:18.607 --> 20:25.075
resurfacing, I really don't know what they stand 
for. Well, in 1982, they were in direct opposition

20:25.460 --> 20:47.198
to the building of the memorial that was put up in 
Washington, saying that what that was was a slap in

20:25.460 --> 20:47.198
the face to the anti-war movement and a 
preparation to get some more 18-year-old boys

20:25.460 --> 20:47.198
ready to go for some imperialistic cause or 
intentions in Central America or wherever. and

20:47.178 --> 20:52.104
therefore they were rejecting that on the basis of 
an anti-imperialist pitch. Well, you know, I

20:52.124 --> 20:57.790
would add they're by far an extremely small 
minority. I think most, the greatest percentage

20:57.890 --> 21:08.983
of vets were thought monuments of some positive 
notoriety were due. To pull almost a quote out of

21:09.942 --> 21:27.060
their 1982 issue, they say the true forgotten 
heroes were actually the VC, where they taught the

21:09.942 --> 21:27.060
anti-war movement how to rebel against the 
imperialists who forced them to crawl and march

21:09.942 --> 21:27.060
forward. Well, I think that's a lot of horse shit, 
and you can quote me on that.

21:36.841 --> 21:43.410
The VC slaughtered so many people, the bloodbath 
that we wanted to prevent occurring. We were

21:43.850 --> 21:48.016
protesting against the war, which we believed was 
coming once we withdrew. It did come, but I don't

21:48.036 --> 21:53.784
think anyone realized the extent of it. The 
killing fields kind of mentality that existed in

21:53.964 --> 22:05.059
Laos and Cambodia, as well as Vietnam, it's hard to 
compliment the VCs. on their contributions to

22:05.596 --> 22:16.011
humanity when the greatest thing they've done is 
kill each other since we've left the country and

22:05.596 --> 22:16.011
kill their neighboring Cambodians. I certainly 
wouldn't compliment the VC on standing up. This

22:21.599 --> 22:28.870
country's had a 200-year reputation for standing 
up.

22:29.120 --> 22:31.503
Just reflects perhaps the radical nature. I think 
it reflects the extremely radical nature. Okay.

22:38.232 --> 22:56.275
One more, I guess, local question, and that is in 
dealing in Mankato or the Twin Cities, did you have

22:38.232 --> 22:56.275
any problems with the mayor, like Stenvig in 
Minneapolis, or were most people pretty

22:38.232 --> 22:56.275
cooperative as far as getting a permit to march or 
things thereof?

23:02.279 --> 23:03.721
Had too much problem. Of course, you're not going 
to put that in. No. We never had too much problem in

23:06.564 --> 23:14.714
Mankato, and I really don't think that we had a 
whole lot of problem in Minneapolis-St. Paul. We

23:15.595 --> 23:30.193
always policed ourselves up and were dedicated, 
nonviolent, and people didn't dread to see us

23:15.595 --> 23:30.193
coming because we didn't leave an aftermath. The 
Mayor Stenvig in Minneapolis, I don't know, he

23:31.321 --> 23:47.728
didn't do anything in denying VVAW any of the 
requests that we submitted to march or to protest

23:31.321 --> 23:47.728
or to meet. He, I believe that he was a little less 
considerate of some of the other organizations.

23:56.127 --> 24:03.454
but politically he didn't think it was a good idea 
to tangle with the vets group because we really

23:56.127 --> 24:03.454
hadn't done anything bad. In Mankato, the police 
chief so identified, was so distraught with the

24:04.175 --> 24:25.797
conduct of the war, and it's continuing, and the 
misinformation and disinformation that the

24:04.175 --> 24:25.797
government and the military published that once 
he reached that position, he resigned from the Air

24:26.468 --> 24:38.324
Force Reserve, where he'd had an 18-year career at 
that point, and had been a Korean War vet. And he

24:39.586 --> 24:45.033
lost his pension and other rights on account of it, 
but he so firmly identified. He also, we at Mankato

24:45.874 --> 24:50.381
did a couple of things. One of them was we conducted 
a I think it amounted to about a 62-day vigil at the

24:54.937 --> 25:03.470
post office where we maintained a continuous 
presence. And he nor the police or anyone other

25:03.490 --> 25:10.059
than individual citizens hassled us there. The 
most violent thing that occurred was the members

25:11.041 --> 25:23.239
of the peace organizations

25:11.041 --> 25:23.239
occupied a bridge between Mankato and North 
Mankato, and it was a primary link of travel for

25:23.911 --> 25:33.361
folks coming in between the two cities. Occupied 
it for one afternoon, and the highway patrol

25:33.922 --> 25:42.812
eventually, with the sheriff and police, had to 
arrest a number of folks. Okay. Now, when did you

25:47.116 --> 25:50.420
leave to wrap up? You left the VVAW, when? Or at 
least your position as regional director? Or did

25:57.110 --> 25:58.412
the movement just fold? The movement just folded. 
There was no subsequent election of anyone after

25:59.534 --> 26:02.578
that. I think the tape's about to run out too.

26:08.628 --> 26:09.389
About ten minutes. Well, with the folding of the 
organization then, how would you view your

26:10.631 --> 26:18.403
accomplishments with what you had intended to do? 
Monumental on a level with Lincoln, Jefferson,

26:19.008 --> 26:23.535
Washington, and Christ.

26:26.880 --> 26:27.681
Seriously. I think in this region, we 
accomplished what we set out to do. I think we did a

26:34.171 --> 26:35.393
good job. We were persistent. We maintained a 
steady image. It was a hard time for Vietnam

26:38.378 --> 26:40.421
veterans. Drugs were coming in. A lot of Vietnam 
veterans fell prey to drugs. We managed to keep, to

26:45.308 --> 26:50.027
disassociate drugs and VVAW. We managed to keep 
veterans who held jobs and went to school

26:50.733 --> 26:56.302
associated with VVAW. On the national level, I 
think they fell prey to drugs and the radical

26:56.903 --> 27:05.778
influences, and it seemed that movements have a 
way of going that way. It's been my own personal

27:05.798 --> 27:07.761
experience. You look at almost any movement, the 
more radicals take over for a while and the

27:07.781 --> 27:13.450
movement goes downhill. and disintegrates. For 
example, currently the women's movement,

27:15.212 --> 27:24.403
they're making much less radical overtures 
because they realize they've turned off a number

27:15.212 --> 27:24.403
of people and they're politically not going to 
achieve things. We politically added a

27:25.003 --> 27:34.915
credibility to the position that we were not 
winning the war, we were not achieving

27:25.003 --> 27:34.915
Vietnamizations, that the statistical body 
count analysis was false, was a false premise,

27:35.131 --> 27:47.583
which was supported by McNamara, who 
subsequently has proclaimed that he regrets

27:35.131 --> 27:47.583
that, that it was a mistake.

27:51.187 --> 28:01.797
Wes Moreland withdrew his suit, his libel suit 
against CBS, clearly indicating that he felt like

27:51.187 --> 28:01.797
he had to go through the motions but knew he 
couldn't win. And there was just too much evidence

28:02.182 --> 28:17.303
that at various levels, various people 
suppressed information, passed on doctored

28:02.182 --> 28:17.303
information, and the position we took that this 
was going on was a true position. And believing in

28:17.864 --> 28:25.795
the democratic process, we wanted to talk this 
over and get that information out, and we

28:17.864 --> 28:25.795
accomplished that. Okay. It seems then that 
you're pretty favorable about what the Midwest

28:27.629 --> 28:39.630
region did based on this Midwest liberalism, 
which you seem to say was best typified by Kerry.

28:40.319 --> 28:41.000
John Kerry? John Kerry from Massachusetts. And 
then you have second thoughts, or you withhold

28:42.703 --> 28:49.353
some of that enthusiasm as far as the movement as a 
national movement. Yeah. I wouldn't say it was

28:49.974 --> 28:59.227
best typified by John Kerry, because he's an 
Easterner and really didn't have his finger on the

28:49.974 --> 28:59.227
pulse of what was happening out here. He was by far 
the most articulate spokesman that VVAW had

28:59.828 --> 29:08.301
surface on any national level. And on the national 
level, I think that the radical elements

29:08.838 --> 29:14.966
controlled and that I don't know what these people 
were up to. And I don't know who supported them. And

29:17.869 --> 29:19.391
I didn't trust them. And if the members here had 
gotten the chance to personally meet them and

29:20.232 --> 29:30.845
associate with them, the members here would not 
have condoned them and did not. We got home. We

29:31.386 --> 29:32.087
discussed it. That was it. We were disgusted. We 
were through with National VVAW. But we continued

29:36.412 --> 29:50.444
our efforts because we weren't sure what had 
happened, whether the FBI had caused this radical

29:36.412 --> 29:50.444
group nationally, whether it didn't matter to us 
who it was, our point was still the same. Let's

29:50.484 --> 29:51.745
continue the dialogue. It's best for the country. 
Right. And with the end of the war, logically the

29:54.828 --> 29:57.870
end of the movement. Yes. Some people have likened 
me to a modern-day Christ, and I want to say that I

29:58.891 --> 30:05.997
don't think that's true. Well, then thank you very 
much for the interview, and hopefully the FBI

30:06.685 --> 30:13.053
doesn't read this. How many years will it be before 
I get the transcript of this one? Well, hopefully

30:16.196 --> 30:17.939
not more than the usual two.

30:35.480 --> 30:35.680
Thank you. Thank

30:36.824 --> 31:03.810
you.
