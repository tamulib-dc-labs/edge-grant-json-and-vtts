WEBVTT

00:10.038 --> 00:19.012
And

00:10.038 --> 00:19.012
he got up and left, and that's where he's going. He 
said, I'm going to go over here. I didn't realize

00:20.114 --> 00:22.477
how smart he was. Because they said Jackie right 
now next to me. And Jackie was the kind of person who

00:25.903 --> 00:29.448
would never really talk to you eye to eye. And he had 
just come back from the Jack Nicklaus Golf School.

00:34.236 --> 00:35.758
And he was talking to a tabbed paper while he was 
talking to me, and he was writing on that, and he

00:36.363 --> 00:43.232
basically said anybody could be a golf coach. That 
is the easiest thing in the world. I mean, my gosh,

00:46.756 --> 00:48.339
what could be easier? You just lay the scoreboard, 
and say, that guy can play, he can get it, yeah,

00:48.359 --> 00:52.524
that's it, you know. And what Nicholas taught me 
down there at that school, you know, anybody can do

00:52.965 --> 00:56.549
it. And I wasn't real pleased

00:57.591 --> 01:03.899
with it. Um, It was when Jackie

01:04.747 --> 01:17.120
brought in John Davis. He was good to me. He was good 
to me. He was always good to me and good

01:19.222 --> 01:26.110
to my family. And Wally. Wally's son has always 
been good to me and good to my family.

01:36.016 --> 01:41.543
Well, just a second. I just thought of something 
else. Wally was, and then I had my first woman.

01:47.350 --> 01:52.096
First woman I had to work for. She was AD over at UPSA 
Lynn Higgins. And then when Lynn left and they

01:55.981 --> 02:01.808
would be over there, then there was an interim. Now 
Mike Caruso is my athletic director.

02:06.509 --> 02:25.621
He's Associate

02:06.509 --> 02:25.621
Athletic Director for Sports

02:06.509 --> 02:25.621
Promotion in the All-Star Athletic League. 
Thanks, Ken. Some of the time, I would climb to his

02:25.941 --> 02:26.963
day. It was his first year there. because all

02:28.109 --> 02:48.556
the afternoon

02:28.109 --> 02:48.556
support was there. Now, at that time, there wasn't 
the academic support, like I said. I figured I'd

02:49.918 --> 02:50.779
leave them until Jackie came. He wasn't real 
strong. I couldn't afford academic support. But I

02:51.981 --> 02:54.304
remember one time, they were looking for NCAA 
rules, but he couldn't find any rules. I got a call

02:54.324 --> 02:55.205
from one of them. What's that rule? They were 
looking out for rules, but nobody had them. Not

02:56.727 --> 02:57.228
every coach had them. But anyway... uh we won them 
over there and it was really a neat thing to be over

02:57.910 --> 03:20.728
there because it was kind of isolated it was brand 
new it was really state-of-the-art food's great

02:57.910 --> 03:20.728
to this day and we kind of wanted them over there and 
then with that additional academic community we

02:57.910 --> 03:20.728
wanted over there because of that

03:25.433 --> 03:53.854
well

03:25.433 --> 03:53.854
we try to keep it uh, like, uh, 12 hours, and then 
taking them to golf. We're keeping that at 13

04:03.155 --> 04:10.585
hours, and we try to give them as much of a basic 
course as we could. We want them to have an English,

04:10.606 --> 04:16.814
a history, maybe a political science, a geology, a 
psychology, something like that. Um, but keep it

04:16.834 --> 04:21.441
where it isn't just going to be as overwhelming as 
it's supposed to be. At that time, it was tough, but

04:21.461 --> 04:22.743
it's not like it's not. I had a kid last year. I

04:24.698 --> 04:36.144
mean, he was a nervous wreck. And I said, Wayne, are 
you going to be able to do this? And I said, really?

04:38.389 --> 04:38.690
Think about it. Are you going to be able to do this? 
And he had a tough time. He just made under on one

04:40.273 --> 04:44.142
point, and then he really turned around there, and 
he could take his final search.

04:51.310 --> 05:05.252
Well, we did the academics, and I remember sitting 
in my office a lot of times,

04:51.310 --> 05:05.252
at school work, and yelling into tell these office 
what about prof so-and-so who's a good teacher for

05:05.485 --> 05:28.202
for math you know a certain math or who's this who 
will help out the athletes and the coaches

05:05.485 --> 05:28.202
basically realize themselves who the the best 
teachers

05:05.485 --> 05:28.202
were no sir i sure don't i do remember The lady, I 
can't remember her name, maybe you know. She

05:33.668 --> 05:35.210
handled all transfer students. White haired lady 
over there, Mrs. Mitchell. And I tell you what, she

05:41.378 --> 05:46.224
was just boom, boom, boom, black and white. But she 
had a heart

05:46.965 --> 05:56.937
of gold. What did she say?

07:28.383 --> 07:49.608
Well,

07:28.383 --> 07:49.608
in

07:28.383 --> 07:49.608
the future, you know, maybe 215, and with the 
realization, hey, we're going to be playing a

07:28.383 --> 07:49.608
little more golf in the fall, you need to pay close 
attention. In those days, too, you had contact

07:49.628 --> 07:54.774
with the professor, and you'd call him up, and now 
you can't do that. So you kind of get, you're in

07:54.794 --> 07:57.057
person, and you have to go see that person.

08:06.014 --> 08:08.057
No, not too many. I do remember Danny. Danny was 
kind of unusual. He didn't know whether he wanted

08:13.425 --> 08:19.614
to be an actor or a golfer. But he won the Southwest 
Conference. And he was a very talented vocalist,

08:22.498 --> 08:24.661
pianist, guitarist. He was a good actor. He could 
have made a good living in that field. And he

08:27.466 --> 08:31.592
decided, no, I want to play golf. And he had a little 
bit of great trouble And I do remember talking to a

08:34.904 --> 08:42.073
cop about Danny and saying how badly we need him. 
And if there's any way you could see, you know, to

08:43.155 --> 08:49.062
help him, it would help us a lot. And he did. He 
helped and got Danny through. But nothing

08:53.868 --> 08:56.111
illegal, at least I was aware of. Now it would be.

09:03.710 --> 09:29.664
We

09:03.710 --> 09:29.664
were usually pretty good. We were usually pretty 
good. And then I got some guys that weren't that

09:30.265 --> 09:31.307
good. We were like a 2-2 overall team. Yes, a lot of 
them were. Yes.

10:08.408 --> 10:12.693
Not

10:08.408 --> 10:12.693
so much. They basically, pretty much stayed with 
golf and hung around with themselves, and they

10:13.614 --> 10:22.946
would, they'd have parties amongst themselves. 
Sometimes they'd bring in, you know, other

10:23.026 --> 10:28.592
people, but most of the time, they were pretty 
close in a group. They stayed pretty much within

10:28.612 --> 10:32.357
themselves, and getting involved There really 
wasn't that much, at that time, that much of campus

10:32.759 --> 10:39.570
activity like there is now. Of course, we've got 
athletes in action type of coming out of John Law

10:40.131 --> 10:50.447
and John Colton, and they get very much involved in 
that stuff, but not much of that. Well, they do

10:51.085 --> 10:54.491
community-oriented work. They'll go talk to kids 
and sometimes troubled kids, at-risk kids, and

10:54.651 --> 11:11.759
they'll talk to them about drugs or they'll talk to 
them about opportunities at school or whatever it

10:54.651 --> 11:11.759
is that they want to talk. Sometimes they'll go out 
and clean out an area or they might go ahead and... I

11:18.085 --> 11:43.266
know Marco, he

11:18.085 --> 11:43.266
refereed some games on the boys' club and 
basketball games and things like that. Well, this

11:43.769 --> 11:46.774
is the only place I've ever coached. I never 
coached until I came here. So I was doing a lot of

11:50.621 --> 11:52.985
OJT. And the difference, I would go every day with 
learning. A lot of times I'd go from just office to

11:58.254 --> 12:01.039
office. What do you do here? What do you do here? 
When something like this happens, what's your

12:03.663 --> 12:06.268
reaction to that? How do you do this? How do you do 
that? I just got a lot of good coaches up there and

12:09.503 --> 12:13.648
got a lot of good advice. And once I think you become 
used to doing something, you become a little bit

12:14.149 --> 12:29.749
more confident, especially if you compare it with 
other coaches, and it's basically what they're

12:14.149 --> 12:29.749
doing, and so you kind of continue on it. But I 
remember in the summertime being able to spend

12:29.769 --> 12:37.519
about four weeks out of the summer with my kids. And 
this day and age, there's absolutely no way

12:38.444 --> 12:49.183
because if you aren't out recruiting, you're 
going to get run over because everybody is out

12:38.444 --> 12:49.183
recruiting. And we did. We would still spend time 
with family. We'd go to the state junior

12:52.469 --> 12:54.031
championship. We'd all pile in the car, and we'd 
get one room. There'd be five kids under seven

12:56.375 --> 13:02.967
people in one room sleeping on the floor and 
sleeping bags and everything, and then I'd go out.

13:03.453 --> 13:11.724
and recruiting kids and everybody staying at a 
motel and going to the pool. But you can't do those

13:12.365 --> 13:14.507
things. You have to get out there, and you better 
get the players. You just can't go in there and tell

13:18.793 --> 13:21.757
them. There's a lot more pressure now, I think, 
than there was. I think they gave you a little more

13:25.742 --> 13:27.464
leeway. But Martin was glad when he left. I know he 
did leave. He left maybe one after. Because he told

13:32.611 --> 13:33.392
me, That's

13:33.794 --> 13:56.927
why he told me that, hey, you're going to have to be 
in the station. So he left the floor, Tom, but they

13:56.947 --> 13:58.109
didn't leave the door. Well, I think you could be a 
little tougher on kids 26 years ago than you can

13:58.129 --> 13:59.871
now. They're a little more sensitive. They're a 
little bit more attuned to the... knowledge of

14:04.996 --> 14:13.968
God, and they're not so, well, try this, you need to 
do this, you need to do that. Well, why? Why do I need

14:15.510 --> 14:17.072
to do that? And that's something I don't know about 
that. Whereas in the older days, they might not

14:20.476 --> 14:23.820
question it. And sometimes today, they won't 
question it, they just won't listen to it. But in

14:30.409 --> 14:32.151
days previously, yeah, they would listen to it.

14:38.375 --> 14:43.028
No,

14:38.375 --> 14:43.028
not necessarily. What we'll do and what we've done 
really for the whole time is we'll play our kind of

14:43.068 --> 14:49.887
film and you can do some kind of banquet or 
something. And hopefully not, but sometimes it

14:50.761 --> 14:55.027
is. And then we would just, after the meal, go back 
to the room, and we'd have a meeting. And we'd

15:00.456 --> 15:10.230
discuss things about the court, starting time, 
who we were going to be playing with, possible

15:00.456 --> 15:10.230
obstacles that we were going to face, and that type 
of thing. And then just go to bed and get up and get

15:10.250 --> 15:15.238
after the game. Well, you know, golfers really, I 
had the hardest time getting to eat. Yeah, well,

15:18.217 --> 15:22.903
they have a nervous time. They say, well, I don't 
want to eat breakfast. A lot of times they're just

15:25.747 --> 15:26.488
scared. You know, they're going out and they can't 
hold the food. But you have to give them food

15:29.131 --> 15:35.519
because if they don't, about 12 or 13 in the morning 
now, they're going to be ripped.

15:38.423 --> 15:39.665
Oh, they drink a lot of soda. They used to. Now 
they're more knowledgeable with, like,

15:40.546 --> 15:44.952
caffeine. They can really mess with their... . . . . 
.

16:03.661 --> 16:04.342
Not always. Sometimes I did. It depends on the 
team, too. I remember one time when we were at

16:08.409 --> 16:19.188
Nationals at North Carolina, we needed a run, and 
I'd do it. I thought it came across great. I didn't

16:20.731 --> 16:22.855
have a cut that I wanted. We didn't make the cut or 
something like that, but it wasn't really where

16:23.316 --> 16:28.605
we'd go out and win it. Sometimes the best comes 
from the players.

16:38.899 --> 16:44.407
If they didn't go ahead, Danny was really good at 
that. He would

16:44.427 --> 16:52.559
just, Dan Brady, he would just tell Jimmy to have me 
coach him, and they'd just go off like that.

16:52.579 --> 16:53.020
Unwritten. I started out with that, and players 
just did not like it. And lots of times players do

16:55.844 --> 16:58.187
not like to be put into a leadership role. but now 
they're going to have to pass judgment on their

16:58.758 --> 17:08.671
peers, and that's very uncomfortable. The young 
man who I have as his assistant right now, he won the

17:08.691 --> 17:13.096
conference championship at 90 pounds and was 
third in the region championship. He just teared

17:13.116 --> 17:20.225
up, and he'd get the whole team together and say, 
I'm going to beat your butt today, and you better

17:13.116 --> 17:20.225
play better. I'm going to beat you, and he'd back it 
up with a game. And this is how he was. He picked

17:25.632 --> 17:28.596
somebody's gut if he didn't do what he thought he 
should have. Here was a great leader, and that's

17:28.576 --> 17:34.146
why we almost won it. Well, yeah, we almost won the 
conference in 95 for that. We could

17:39.656 --> 17:46.187
have won it in 96. And we won the regional 
championship in 96. That's strange. When I first

17:47.790 --> 17:48.812
got here, I saw Emil Mammolini. Remember Emil? He 
said he was the one training program for

17:49.734 --> 17:51.597
Mammolini. I said, ma'am, these guys, they need 
something. You're right. They're fights, you

18:02.829 --> 18:04.551
know, they're dumb. He set up a whole training 
program. They put him to coach at the University of

18:05.813 --> 18:08.176
Houston. He said, why do you want to go there? All 
you can do is run and lift weights. And now, it's the

18:12.142 --> 18:14.445
same. Oh, yeah. I mean, you have Tiger Woods. He 
brings it out much more than David D. Dahl. I mean,

18:23.832 --> 18:34.107
these guys are just, they have their weight, they 
have their training, and they are really, really

18:23.832 --> 18:34.107
conditioned

18:23.832 --> 18:34.107
athletes. Oh, yeah. Well, we're up, I don't know 
what time, but we have the old training of strength

18:34.540 --> 18:45.494
and conditioning training at 6 a.m. And they work 
for an hour on that. Now, we're doing that this

18:46.235 --> 18:49.840
week. We're getting everybody together so 
everybody sees everything. That's important.

18:54.526 --> 18:59.152
Next week, we're only allowed four hours a day, 20 
hours a week. So this cuts into our strength and

18:59.172 --> 19:02.657
conditioning training. I'd ask the children, the 
NCAA. We cannot spend more time than you. One of

19:12.735 --> 19:18.163
your questions was, basically, what was the 
workload? Well, it was seven days on the time. But

19:19.865 --> 19:21.768
now you can go more than 20 hours. I can't demand a 
gym. And this is the tournament time. Practice,

19:24.892 --> 19:26.334
qualify, all of it. So next week, they're on their 
own. But like I told them, I am going to review with

19:27.316 --> 19:30.400
the strength base whether you're there or not. 
where they're going to

19:30.785 --> 19:51.140
have to come in on their own and work out two times a 
week with the same conditions, hearing and

19:30.785 --> 19:51.140
speaking. Wouldn't work with a lot of weight. They 
work with more exercise. They work with

20:01.540 --> 20:02.481
stretching. They work with more conditioning, 
cardio, that sort of thing. Because so much of what

20:07.486 --> 20:11.911
we do, I'm not even trying to point, we're out 
playing, and we're playing the hills over in

20:07.486 --> 20:11.911
Austin, right? We're walking up 18, look back, 
yeah, yeah, yeah, all right. Here's the guys

20:14.374 --> 20:18.238
working out every day of the week. Yeah. He was 
absolutely worn out carrying his bag and walking

20:19.722 --> 20:25.609
18 holes. To us, it's nothing. What we do now is we 
play 36 holes one day and 18 holes the next day. So

20:31.857 --> 20:34.000
there is a lot more conditioning. And days before, 
we'd go to turn and play 18 holes, 18 holes, 18

20:34.020 --> 20:39.606
holes. Now, we're restricted because of our time 
and playing days. We're only allowed 140-foot

20:44.573 --> 20:48.177
playing days. yearly, or days, and then we're only 
allowed 24 plane dates where we actually go out and

20:48.983 --> 21:01.480
compete. So we compress that by playing 36 holes 
one day, and 18 holes the second day. That's 54

21:07.509 --> 21:13.097
holes, which is, it kind of speaks to college 
tournament, but it only takes up two days. So these

21:13.117 --> 21:14.478
guys really have to be in good shape. Part of that is 
stretching and conditioning out during the

21:14.498 --> 21:16.341
winter break.

21:27.593 --> 21:40.951
Probably they'd play nine, hit balls, or kick the 
puck, or at least two or three hours.

21:40.971 --> 21:43.935
No, the manufacturers did. Not all of them, but a 
lot of them did. David, Gary Hart, was a tour rep for

21:46.859 --> 21:55.390
him in the middle 70s. And he was trying to get the 
club out on tour. And these players were such a

22:00.423 --> 22:01.604
radical club. The players on tour had nothing to do 
with it. So Gary, being the bright individual he

22:04.247 --> 22:08.632
is, let's go to colleges. Let's go the next step 
down and get these people involved with events. So

22:12.576 --> 22:14.718
when they get out on tour, they're going to be there 
to play. So he teach some schools, and we were one of

22:16.139 --> 22:21.345
them. And he came in and said, this is what we'd like 
to do. And so ever since 1975... He's always been a

22:25.930 --> 22:30.556
great sponsor. That's Carson Swell. He's the 
inventor of the Penn Club. He's a guy who invented

22:37.165 --> 22:40.089
the Penn Club. In fact, he invented the rabbit

22:40.189 --> 22:49.201
ears on television. Brilliant. Tylus gets those. 
Tylus gets some of those.

22:59.258 --> 23:01.120
Oh, yeah, every member. Every member will get, 
initially, when we first started, the university

23:01.841 --> 23:12.935
would buy them. And then, as we got better,

23:12.955 --> 23:23.709
