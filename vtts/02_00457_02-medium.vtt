WEBVTT

00:02.123 --> 00:07.369
He says, how many damn machine guns do you have on 
those B-25s? I said, well, some of them have five or

00:07.389 --> 00:15.559
six, and some of them have two or three. He says, you 
literally plowed me a trench.

00:20.344 --> 00:23.648
We just bombed and scraped the hell out of him. But 
he escaped. He said, I was ready to kill you guys.

00:33.730 --> 00:35.452
Okay.

00:36.774 --> 00:46.548
Well, I guess now could you kind of explain some, 
maybe the hardships that you endured that we

00:36.774 --> 00:46.548
hadn't already talked about, I guess. We talked 
about the where-was. Well, the worst hardship was

00:51.355 --> 00:52.978
no women. See, for six months we had nothing to 
nurse or anything. And I'm told there was a lot of

01:01.350 --> 01:03.653
homosexuals. homosexual activity went up there. 
Now, I heard that later,

01:07.841 --> 01:15.570
and I don't know how true it was. I wasn't aware of 
it, but I wouldn't be surprised. That was the worst

01:20.236 --> 01:26.343
hardship, was just no women, and food was 
marginal. No whiskey, really, and no beer. We got a

01:29.267 --> 01:34.433
shitload of beer in there, and I don't know, I think 
the Navy got most of it. There just wasn't much to

01:35.611 --> 01:43.960
do, much in the way of recreation. Of course, I had 
no drive. I could have gone back to, in fact, some of

01:45.041 --> 01:51.369
the drive went back and it went up to Fairbanks. Had 
my ball up there, but I don't know. I don't know. Can

01:58.516 --> 02:04.403
you kind of maybe go through a day, a normal day, up 
there that, uh, just kind of go through the events

02:05.193 --> 02:15.643
that you would, you know, take place, I guess, from 
the time you got up to about the time you, from

02:05.193 --> 02:15.643
Reveille to Tafts, I guess. Well, we wouldn't have 
any Reveille without a whistle.

02:24.271 --> 02:31.377
No

02:24.271 --> 02:31.377
Reveille. Uh... Thank you for waiting.

02:42.217 --> 02:54.638
Well, it's kind of hard to name a typical day 
because we would be assigned, we would be briefed

02:42.217 --> 02:54.638
and told where we were going when the fog lifted. 
And then we would sit in this ready room, what they

02:54.658 --> 02:59.486
called the ready room, which originally was a 
tent. And the well walked me the tent away and they

03:00.328 --> 03:04.174
brought in the

03:10.280 --> 03:21.975
And we'd just sit there and play poker and bridge

03:10.280 --> 03:21.975
gambling. And we'd go for walks, but we weren't 
allowed to go very far. It had

03:25.419 --> 03:32.468
to be in whistling distance. Then we'd go eat, 
which was more of a damn chore than a pleasure

03:32.588 --> 03:39.277
because there wasn't much to eat. Red Stan.

03:45.633 --> 03:52.644
Oh, I tell you, we used to have raids, excursions on 
the Navy. The Navy had much better

03:52.664 --> 03:58.192
supplies than we did. And so we'd go on raids and go 
and raid their vessel and get the food. Get shot at,

04:06.124 --> 04:11.152
but nobody got hurt. You know, we went raiding.

04:18.185 --> 04:18.986
What did you do after that? Just sat on and waited 
for those things. Well, listen, we had one record

04:23.850 --> 04:28.935
player listen to those stupid records. Judy 
Garland singing. Put a little milk in her cow. Oh,

04:35.922 --> 04:38.464
the Andrews sisters. They got awful over it. Why 
don't you do right?

04:44.490 --> 04:46.211
Like some of the men did. That was about it. They 
ever... I guess, send any movies or anything, any

04:48.442 --> 04:52.948
of the newsreels? They had movies on Adak Island. 
They had, and that's where I was first stationed. I

05:00.597 --> 05:05.464
made my first raid out of Adak, and that was good 
living. Adak was nice. But on Amchitka, we

05:06.605 --> 05:13.474
didn't have anything in the way of entertainment. 
What time do you normally go to bed in the evening,

05:13.494 --> 05:15.316
sir? I guess the...

05:21.280 --> 05:21.961
No. We didn't, like I said, we didn't have any types 
of revelry. We just had a whistle open. We could

05:27.968 --> 05:30.551
sleep whenever we wanted to. Unless we had some 
extra duty, like digging foxholes or something

05:30.571 --> 05:37.019
like that. You know, officers were not supposed to 
work. But we got hooked. We had to dig our own

05:41.505 --> 05:45.550
foxhole. No revelry, no revelry hours. About how 
many men were stationed on Chitka? Well, Chitka

05:54.598 --> 06:16.425
had a... Maybe they got a bunch of crews up there, 
heavy bombard B-24s, four-engine planes, but our

05:54.598 --> 06:16.425
B-25s created a normal complement of seven, six or 
seven

05:54.598 --> 06:16.425
men. I don't know whether they're buried or what, 
but anyhow, the... They had a total of, we had 20, 20

06:21.322 --> 06:34.036
airplanes when we

06:21.322 --> 06:34.036
went up there. We had about 10, I guess, when we came 
back. 20 times, what did I say? 20 times 7 is 140.

06:44.488 --> 06:44.588
Okay. All right. In all, do you consider,

07:06.547 --> 07:12.397
They got up on those boats and left, and we blamed 
the Navy for letting them get away. Of course, you

07:12.417 --> 07:16.083
couldn't see your hands on your face, but we blamed 
the Navy. The Navy blamed the Air Force because

07:16.103 --> 07:21.032
they didn't bomb them heavy enough. Act II was a 
bloodbath. Act II was a terrible bloodbath, and I

07:23.416 --> 07:29.626
didn't participate in it except for bombing. But 
that was it. Act II had Fish Hook Ridge. And those

07:34.255 --> 07:40.741
poor old guys, they caught in hell. They had 
frostbite. The guys were pretty keen. They

07:43.744 --> 07:44.464
weren't dumb. I don't know how they happened to 
lose that war. I guess they were just dumber than we

07:47.487 --> 07:49.669
were. And we were pretty dumb. But our troops went 
in. The land hit. And the command was to blame.

07:59.758 --> 08:03.722
General Brown was commanding the troops, the 
ground troops. And he took them in and dumped them

08:04.512 --> 08:13.446
in that cold water with no rubber boots. So their 
feet got wet immediately. And then the Japs let

08:16.932 --> 08:19.296
them come in. They came in. And came in, set up their 
tents, and they got all nice and situated. Then the

08:27.449 --> 08:30.473
Japs hit them. And they pinned them down. in the 
valley. They had a valley called Massacre Valley.

08:36.212 --> 08:43.359
And it was surprising, because it was named for a 
battle that the Russians had had with the Lute

08:36.212 --> 08:43.359
Indians 100 years before. And they had massacred 
the Lute Indians. Well, they had a massacre that

08:47.163 --> 08:49.846
day. They caught our boys, and they just pinned 
them down. And they got frostbite, and they lost

08:53.370 --> 08:56.954
their toes. And they went and cut a lot of their toes 
off. We finally bombed them

09:01.212 --> 09:09.322
off from there, I think. But they suffered a lot. We 
never

09:11.225 --> 09:15.029
did. I never suffered that much. Thank God I wasn't 
an infantryman, I tell you. Okay, well, is there

09:20.316 --> 09:27.205
any, I guess, anything you might want to add to all 
of this? Well, there are a lot of anecdotes that I

09:27.225 --> 09:29.768
could add, but They don't come to mind at the 
moment. When I kind of made this word count, I told

09:33.112 --> 09:42.926
myself, I've got to chop this off.

09:42.946 --> 09:45.269
It's going to be a book. Now, I think a lot of things, 
you know, like the guy says, I think of a real clever

09:45.289 --> 09:53.241
answer to that after you go.

09:59.735 --> 10:01.783
No, I think that's pretty well got it. That damn 
chimp car that I preserved was a miserable mess. As

10:05.939 --> 10:10.015
I said in here, I would have deserted, but there 
wasn't any place to go now.
