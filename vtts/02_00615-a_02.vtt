00:04.840 --> 00:08.605
While you were in Washington with the 
Oceanographic Office, how large did it become?

00:13.411 --> 00:26.848
I left there in 1952 to go to Hawaii, and I honestly 
can't answer that, because the Division of

00:13.411 --> 00:26.848
Oceanography began very small, five people, as I 
mentioned. But it was only one small portion of the

00:27.824 --> 00:32.029
then Hydrographic Office. There was air 
navigation. There was the chart construction

00:33.491 --> 00:47.429
group, the print shops for navigation charts for 
both the sea and aviation. And the Division of

00:47.469 --> 00:51.514
Oceanography was a very small group. And it grew. 
And by the time we left, I left, I'm sorry, 52. About

00:58.146 --> 01:03.814
all I can remember, it must have been 200. Now, that 
may be large. I'm not sure. It was while I was in

01:06.458 --> 01:19.477
Hawaii that the decision was made to change the 
name from the Navy Hydrographic Office to the Navy

01:06.458 --> 01:19.477
Oceanographic Office. Interesting thing about 
that group under Dr. Fleming is that a large

01:19.497 --> 01:26.046
percentage of your Government oceanographers in 
the United States came from there. Bob Abel, who

01:34.173 --> 01:39.498
was the head of the Sea Grant program here with 
NOAA. Murray Schaefer, oceanographer of the

01:39.518 --> 01:43.242
Bureau of Ordnance.

01:46.305 --> 01:56.556
Bill Littlewood, who became the science attache 
in Copenhagen and then Tokyo and is now with AID in

01:46.305 --> 01:56.556
the Middle East. Sidney Upham, who went with the 
Navy Oceanographic Instrumentation Office. You

02:06.778 --> 02:08.901
can just go right down the list. And I would say 80% 
of the people that were with the Navy

02:09.162 --> 02:25.885
Oceanographic Office who came out of school with a 
degree in some of the natural sciences, but no

02:09.162 --> 02:25.885
degrees in oceanography, have ended up in quite 
responsible positions positions in

02:26.287 --> 02:30.213
oceanography and academia and in the government. 
Would you suggest that this is why? Because you

02:33.938 --> 02:37.002
guys were the first people? Yeah, sure. Okay. I 
can't think of any other reason, really, because

02:39.966 --> 02:47.417
there were three places in the nation at that time 
that, quote, turned out oceanographers, end

02:47.650 --> 02:49.572
quote. That was Scripps. No, actually only two. 
Scripps and the University of Washington in terms

02:52.695 --> 02:57.841
of formal academic training. The University of 
Washington only after Dick Fleming left the Navy

02:58.842 --> 03:09.733
Oceanographic Office, then the Hydrographic 
Office, and became the director of the Division of

02:58.842 --> 03:09.733
Oceanography at the University of Washington. 
Woods Hole did not turn out anybody in

03:10.594 --> 03:16.020
oceanography because it was a research 
institution. with interactions with MIT, it now

03:16.574 --> 03:23.363
is a degree-granting organization. But that's 
what I've lost touch, perhaps, in the last 10

03:23.463 --> 03:29.410
years. So for all those years, there simply was no 
place. You didn't have the big Institute of Marine

03:33.055 --> 03:36.479
Sciences in Miami. In fact, I used to go to Dr. 
Smith's lab out on Coral Island at the edge of Miami

03:43.945 --> 03:54.001
where he was looking at the rate of fouling on 
panels as a function of anti-fouling paints. He

03:54.602 --> 04:02.114
brought that lab from himself up to a 
multi-million dollar institution and it is now.

04:02.134 --> 04:06.461
You didn't have Texas A&M oceanographically 
speaking. You didn't have Oregon State.

04:15.400 --> 04:21.087
When you decided to go to Hawaii,

04:15.400 --> 04:21.087
why? Well, I don't want to go into the dramatic 
experience of pulling, but I had accepted the job

04:21.568 --> 04:44.817
to go there because I pretty well knew the people 
and the work in Western Europe, from Scandinavian

04:21.568 --> 04:44.817
countries to, say, Spain. So I wanted to go to 
Hawaii so I could see the work being done in the

04:46.400 --> 04:51.425
Orient. Also, because the man at that time, the 
director of the lab in Hawaii, was Oscar Elton

04:52.866 --> 05:09.661
Asete, who I looked at as one of the greatest of the 
marine ecologists in terms of the fishes. In fact,

05:09.821 --> 05:15.006
his whole thesis was that you could go from the wind 
to the water, to the fish. And if you learned enough

05:19.400 --> 05:31.697
about the meteorological events controlling the 
water, you could go directly from the wind to the

05:19.400 --> 05:31.697
fish, he used to say, and put the oceanographers 
out of work. And the deputy director at that time

05:32.779 --> 05:44.976
was one, Donald McKernan, who went to Alaska from 
our lab in Hawaii and then became the director of

05:32.779 --> 05:44.976
the Bureau of Commercial Fishers. To go to a place 
like that where I was within 500 yards of the lab

05:46.154 --> 05:59.230
from my home, I lived in faculty housing, had two 
strong sons. I just seemed ideal because of the

05:59.250 --> 06:08.921
wheelchair and because I hadn't quite learned how 
to live in society yet after over a year. So Hawaii

06:09.782 --> 06:12.145
had everything. challenging research in the 
oceanography, descriptive oceanography of the

06:12.361 --> 06:17.649
tropical Pacific. I could bring my background in 
biology to bear in that I was to be in charge of an

06:18.510 --> 06:35.475
oceanographic program that was concerned with 
why the tuna fish lived where they lived and did

06:18.510 --> 06:35.475
what they did, and to work with superb people in a 
tropical paradise. My God, what more could a man

06:35.535 --> 06:40.242
ask for?

06:41.605 --> 06:44.087
You keep speaking of descriptive oceanography. 
And it seems that's what you were primarily

06:45.609 --> 06:49.092
involved in, in terms of descriptive 
oceanography. But I noticed from your vita that

06:49.372 --> 06:57.080
you did some of the primary work, for example, in 
bringing a computer into oceanography, which

06:49.372 --> 06:57.080
helps to change the nature of oceanography. Do you 
have any explanation for that? Oh, I guess it was

07:01.404 --> 07:05.908
just being where I was at the time that I got 
interested in that. Descriptive oceanography is

07:07.850 --> 07:11.393
really passe. At the time, I liked to think of 
myself as a descriptive oceanographer along with

07:13.094 --> 07:27.796
probably one of the best, Joe Reed, Val 
Worthington at Woods Hole, Gary Metcalf at Woods

07:13.094 --> 07:27.796
Hole. These were people who went to sea to describe 
how the ocean looked. The fact that you had a

07:35.588 --> 07:51.669
current flowing across the tropical that became 
the Gulf Stream, that became the North Atlantic

07:35.588 --> 07:51.669
current, that then returned back into this, and 
here's this, as here goes the sea. That's

07:51.769 --> 07:54.513
describing what the Gulf Stream looked like. So we 
made hundreds of sections across the Gulf Stream

07:54.613 --> 08:02.203
to see what the cold wall looked like and so forth. 
Most of that was done with damn crude instruments.

08:07.110 --> 08:10.616
We simply didn't have sophisticated electronic 
instruments. And if we did, none of us knew how to

08:10.756 --> 08:14.744
operate the damn thing anyway. Then I went with the 
beer commercial fisheries in Hawaii, came back to

08:14.764 --> 08:22.858
Washington, and then went to Miami. I began to 
realize that the data we were collecting, we had

08:24.492 --> 08:39.710
two big ships in Miami, the Geronimo and the 
Undaunted, two big ATAs that we converted for

08:24.492 --> 08:39.710
oceanographic and fishery research in the Gulf of 
Guinea. And we were becoming swamped by the data.

08:44.957 --> 08:47.840
We weren't able to keep up with the volume of the 
data. We now had underway instruments, for

08:47.900 --> 08:52.626
instance, that we hadn't had before. And then we 
had one of the first of the salinity temperature

08:54.428 --> 09:04.901
depth recorders in lieu of a Nansen bottle cast and 
reversing thermometers. You lowered this damn

09:04.921 --> 09:15.153
monster into the ocean, and on deck you got a record 
of temperature salinity against the depth. So

09:15.173 --> 09:22.782
while we were in Miami, the University of Miami, 
which is also on Virginia Key, installed a

09:22.913 --> 09:24.435
computer. And one of the leaders in its use was a man 
by the name of Dr. Bill Richardson, who you may

09:25.356 --> 09:39.052
recall drowned in the Gulf of Maine last year out on 
an oceanographic cruise. And so he convinced me

09:39.072 --> 09:52.347
that if I would support them with a few dollars that 
we could develop computer programming that would

09:39.072 --> 09:52.347
allow us to begin processing these data and make 
them more amenable to auto

09:52.748 --> 10:00.159
manipulation. And then I got an offer and went down 
there in 65 and 67 as the director of the National

10:01.140 --> 10:12.036
Oceanographic Data Center here in Washington. So 
I came back to Washington again, where I always

10:13.138 --> 10:21.490
seem to come no matter where the hell I go, took over 
NODC and immediately was able to convince the

10:22.246 --> 10:31.819
advisory board to provide us with the resources to 
install a big, in those days, a big IBM 36040. And

10:33.141 --> 10:37.147
from there on, we have just gotten bigger and 
bigger and bigger. And right now, we have six

10:37.287 --> 10:42.855
centers in EDS. We have one primarily concerned 
with oceanographic data, one primarily

10:42.875 --> 10:49.384
concerned with atmospheric buried the data, and 
there we have records that go back to the early

10:50.090 --> 10:53.995
1800s. And then one concerned with earthquakes, 
sunspots, marine geology, angio-physics, and so

10:54.135 --> 11:04.268
forth. So there's no way, for instance, at NCC in 
Asheville, we have 126 million

11:04.288 --> 11:19.607
sheets of weather observations, which if we did 
not have those keypunches available on computer

11:19.908 --> 11:21.911
technology. There would be no way we could, well, 
this last winter, which was so atypical, because

11:21.951 --> 11:30.823
of what we had there, we were able to go back and see. 
You learn from the atypical, really, not from the

11:31.384 --> 11:34.508
typical. 1917 and 18 were so much like this year 
that it was unbelievable. Now, Jerome Nomias, a

11:40.837 --> 11:48.227
man at Scripps, feels that the anomalies of 
temperature in the North Pacific control the

11:49.203 --> 11:51.766
weather patterns. And for what it's worth, in 
August of 1917 and in August 1976, sea surface

11:53.588 --> 12:08.445
temperatures in the North Pacific were five 
degrees below the 100-year norms. And the jet

12:09.806 --> 12:17.455
stream, the high altitude air flow, changed both 
times to move the warm northern Pacific air masses

12:18.464 --> 12:26.477
up to Alaska, and then swoop down into the eastern 
United States and freeze the hell out of it. And in

12:26.497 --> 12:38.295
both years, 1918 and 1977, the departures from the 
mean temperatures in the southeastern United

12:26.497 --> 12:38.295
States ran as much as 15 degrees. 1932 is the 
warmest year in 100 years of records. and the sea

12:45.464 --> 12:56.079
surface temperatures in the North Pacific the 
previous August were well above the normals

12:45.464 --> 12:56.079
available. So, what that means, I'm not sure. It 
could be purely coincidence, but it sure is

12:58.062 --> 13:05.613
suggestive that Jerome Neimias is right. Now, 
when you first arrived at Florida, exactly what

13:05.633 --> 13:11.681
was your job there? Well, you mean... I'm sorry, 
I'm Hawaii. I want to drop back from Florida to

13:15.267 --> 13:17.490
Hawaii. I was the chief of the oceanography 
branch. I came there after a gentleman by the name

13:23.057 --> 13:31.026
of Thompson Cromwell, about whom you may have 
heard. He was killed in an airplane crash in Mexico

13:31.046 --> 13:40.157
and was one of the most promising of the younger 
oceanographers. And he's the one who discovered

13:40.217 --> 13:43.281
equatorial undercurrent now called the Cromwell 
Current in the Pacific. And he wanted to go back to

13:47.917 --> 13:54.508
Scripps, so there was an opening at Hawaii. And as I 
say, I was in Europe when the offer came, and I took

13:54.528 --> 13:57.412
it. And then I had a year out until I went back, and 
they very kindly held the job open for that whole

13:58.655 --> 14:05.285
year. And what sort of... innovations or changes 
did you try to make after you arrived at Hawaii?

14:15.357 --> 14:17.419
What sort of things did you want your lab to do? Two 
things, actually. The first thing I speak of

14:19.661 --> 14:24.165
because I remember it so vividly. The lab opened in 
1949. I went there in 1952. By that time, there were

14:31.672 --> 14:39.019
about ten cruises between Hawaii and the 
Marquesas Islands, areas south of the equator.

14:45.251 --> 14:50.678
And through a variety of circumstances, none of 
the data had ever been worked up. So my first job was

14:51.779 --> 15:01.009
to prepare all of these data, quality control, 
tabulate, and publish. So the first three years, I

15:02.691 --> 15:06.255
guess, I spent with a group of very fine people. We 
introduced ADP techniques in terms of key

15:10.253 --> 15:20.945
punching and that type of equipment. We didn't 
have a computer, but we had the ADP equipment. Then

15:27.312 --> 15:33.559
we began looking at the data as it described the 
oceans.

15:33.775 --> 15:47.436
The tropical Pacific circulation is fascinating 
because it's such a wide ocean compared to the

15:33.775 --> 15:47.436
Atlantic with the bulge of Africa and the bulge of 
South America. You have a beautiful east-west,

15:48.197 --> 15:54.327
4,000 miles to work in. And the tunas were 
distributed pretty damn well from the Baja

15:54.347 --> 16:02.179
California to Hawaii across the Pacific. to the 
Asiatic waters of the Japanese. And north of

16:06.880 --> 16:18.272
Hawaii was the so-called transition zone between 
the warm subtropical and the cold dilution waters

16:06.880 --> 16:18.272
where the albacore lived. So we had the skipjack 
tuna, the albacore tuna, and the elephant tuna.

16:24.940 --> 16:29.044
And then there was a big skipjack fishery in 
Hawaii. These fisheries change. One year it's

16:32.232 --> 16:36.978
good, and the fishermen catch a lot of fish, and the 
next year it's lousy. How come the difference? Do

16:40.282 --> 16:44.347
they have a different migration path? Were the 
eggs and a larvae of that year class impacted by a

16:44.367 --> 16:52.517
bad year in terms of the temperatures and length of 
the year? For instance, the albacore moved from

16:53.830 --> 17:05.004
the Oregon fishery across the whole North Pacific 
in one season and entered the Japanese longline

16:53.830 --> 17:05.004
fishery. They moved across the transition zone, 
we found out ultimately, because that's where the

17:05.905 --> 17:15.957
soury, a little fish that the albacore eat, lives. 
Most all animals have a zone. of conditions, let's

17:20.729 --> 17:28.478
just say temperature, salinity, oxygen, you can 
think of other things, that's optimum. So the

17:29.639 --> 17:36.127
maximum number of the animals are in this zone and 
then you get fewer and fewer and fewer and fewer.

17:36.227 --> 17:48.441
Okay, if this is where the food of the albacore live 
and I'm an albacore here and I want to get here, I'm

17:36.227 --> 17:48.441
going to move right through there the whole damn 
way across because that's where I can find food.

17:48.927 --> 17:52.311
You find fish where they can make a living. So we 
were in an area that was unexplored. The tropical

17:57.236 --> 18:04.925
Pacific was essentially unknown in a descriptive 
oceanography sense. Equatorial undercurrent,

18:04.945 --> 18:09.109
equatorial countercurrent, the upwelling. How 
long after the upwelling, the cool, deep waters

18:12.788 --> 18:16.373
come to the surface loaded with nutrients. So you 
begin to get development of phytoplankton,

18:17.235 --> 18:26.728
zooplankton, the forage organisms, and 
concentrations of the tunas. We didn't know. It

18:28.351 --> 18:35.942
was an exciting time for a person with my kind of a 
background, because it was all new. And calculus,

18:37.384 --> 18:38.686
forget it. I wouldn't have gotten through 
calculus in graduate school My wife had them in a

18:42.640 --> 18:45.243
math major. So descriptive oceanography, you 
have to have kind of an innate curiosity. Why does A

18:51.189 --> 18:59.538
follow B, and why does B follow C, and what happens 
if A doesn't happen in terms of B and C? Okay, you go

19:00.338 --> 19:07.686
out and you plan a series of observations, and you 
watch these things change, and you say, ha-ha. But

19:08.408 --> 19:20.506
you don't sit down and use integral and 
differential calculus, which is a beautiful way

19:08.408 --> 19:20.506
now to do things, because you have massive 
computers into which you can feed models of the

19:08.408 --> 19:20.506
ocean. And then you can ask the computer, if I 
change A, what will happen to B? Or if I reverse A,

19:26.214 --> 19:33.825
what happens to B and C? have now gone from the 
descriptive to the analytical, I think, in the

19:34.143 --> 19:38.227
marine sciences. You're now beginning to ask, 
what is the sequence of events and how fast do they

19:38.267 --> 19:46.274
happen? How much warm water is carried in the Gulf 
Stream from the tropical Atlantic into the

19:46.294 --> 19:53.101
temperate? What's the impact of the climate? What 
would happen if the Gulf Stream would slow down or

19:56.704 --> 20:01.569
speed up? These things, now you can... Well, the 
Von Arxes and the Stommels and the Smagorinskys

20:03.708 --> 20:12.656
and others can begin looking at these in the big 
computers.

20:15.879 --> 20:17.621
How long were you in Hawaii? Ten years, almost to 
the day. And while there, did you seem to feel as if

20:20.764 --> 20:27.049
after ten years your work there had completed? 
Yeah, there was a combination of a lot of

20:27.670 --> 20:32.314
circumstances actually. After ten years hearing 
each of us give the same papers over again, only in a

20:32.581 --> 20:56.136
slightly modified form, I felt somewhat isolated 
from the marine oceanographic, which is a

20:32.581 --> 20:56.136
redundancy, the marine community of scientists, 
because it was not easy for me to travel. That was

20:56.216 --> 20:59.922
the personal aspect of it. 1961, my son was old 
enough, we took off. We went to England and we spent

21:06.529 --> 21:09.655
six weeks in Europe. And from that time on, I have 
gone to oceanographic meetings and delegations

21:17.468 --> 21:25.663
was the chairman of one of the major committees of 
the Intergovernmental Oceanographic

21:17.468 --> 21:25.663
Commission ever since. I've gone to Europe at 
least two times a year ever since. You were in

21:30.091 --> 21:32.936
Helsinki though in 1960, were you not? Yeah. 
Didn't you go to work in the International

21:33.276 --> 21:35.500
Conference there? Is that when your son went with 
you? Yes, yes, yes. I said 61. I'm wrong. Oh, okay. I

21:42.986 --> 21:45.811
guess it was 19... Well, I may be wrong. No, it was 
either 60 or 61. He and I took off and went to the

21:48.756 --> 21:55.288
International Union for Geodesy and Geophysics 
in Helsinki. Then we went to every major

21:55.589 --> 22:01.920
oceanographic lab between Helsinki and Lisbon. 
Now, is this the first time you've become

22:02.660 --> 22:08.587
seriously interested in international 
cooperation among oceanographers? I think so. I

22:10.549 --> 22:12.451
was interested prior to that. I was in Europe when I 
was exposed to polio. So I had been with the IUGG,

22:18.579 --> 22:29.251
but I guess that's when I first realized I wanted to 
do more than I was doing. We went to Copenhagen. to

22:31.853 --> 22:53.504
the organizational meeting of the 
Intergovernmental Oceanographic Commission,

22:31.853 --> 22:53.504
at which time I had a chance to interact with George 
Deacon and Roger Revelle and Secretary Wakelin

22:31.853 --> 22:53.504
and people that I had heard about but hadn't had an 
opportunity to really interact with. Warren

22:53.664 --> 22:58.992
Wooster, Dr. Bernica from Hamburg, all of these 
people. I became really excited, began going as a

23:01.289 --> 23:09.821
member, as an observer to the delegations, then as 
a member. Then when I became, I became involved in

23:11.103 --> 23:25.063
the planning of a 14-nation

23:11.103 --> 23:25.063
oceanographic survey of the tropical Atlantic 
called ICITA. And we got together the ships from

23:26.005 --> 23:42.490
each of the nations, our own included, and had a 
midwinter and a midsummer survey from Africa to

23:26.005 --> 23:42.490
South America on and to the Gulf and Caribbean. And 
other than in the ocean, that was the first major

23:42.510 --> 23:50.822
cooperative international oceanographic 
survey. And I made so many friends. just became so

23:55.402 --> 24:05.093
thoroughly captivated with the idea of working 
with these people. For instance, in West Africa,

24:05.213 --> 24:14.083
Sierra Leone, Republic of Ivory Coast, 
Congo-Brazzaville, a nation. My first

24:14.103 --> 24:24.295
experience of the problems between the black 
people and the Portuguese, and I began to realize

24:14.103 --> 24:24.295
that international oceanography I can remember 
we were in Abidjan in the Republic of Ivory Coast,

24:24.578 --> 24:32.607
and in our hotel was a bowling alley. And my son and I 
went down, and here was two people from East

24:33.829 --> 24:52.611
Germany, and

24:33.829 --> 24:52.611
two people from Kiel in West Germany, three people 
from the USSR,

24:54.329 --> 25:05.932
Mario from Portugal,

24:54.329 --> 25:05.932
several nations, all around a big table, eating 
hot dogs and hamburgers. And they had an eggs and

25:06.112 --> 25:12.765
larvae bowling team and the adult fish bowling 
team. And on the way back to the hotel, my son said,

25:12.865 --> 25:16.472
Dad, you know. If oceanographers could run the 
governments of the world, there would be no

25:17.009 --> 25:22.495
problems. You've never seen such a mixture of 
people as far as their political beliefs, at least

25:22.515 --> 25:34.787
in terms of the national postures we're 
concerned. East Germany, West Germany, USSR,

25:34.887 --> 25:42.915
Portugal, the black Africans, United States, 
Canada. We just had a ball there. In fact, they I

25:46.456 --> 25:51.763
think perhaps we got more oceanography done as a 
result of that. Do you think that international

25:53.746 --> 26:00.535
cooperation was even possible before 57 and the 
IGY? Tom? Sure. I think through the International

26:04.000 --> 26:13.172
Union for Geology and Geophysics and the 
International Council of Scientific Unions, a

26:13.861 --> 26:21.189
group called YAPSO, the International 
Association for Physical Oceanographers. Yeah,

26:21.209 --> 26:22.751
sure. It was somewhat of a different type of 
cooperation, though. It was people gathering to

26:26.375 --> 26:41.573
hear each other give learned papers and be totally 
bored, of course, but this compared to bringing

26:26.375 --> 26:41.573
together other ships of lots of nations 
exchanging the scientists on ships, exchanging

26:42.329 --> 26:51.624
equipment,

26:42.329 --> 26:51.624
the data management problems. It was this type of 
international cooperation that was the result of

26:51.944 --> 26:59.376
the Intergovernmental Oceanographic 
Commission. You see, there's the international

26:59.396 --> 27:05.225
aspects, like ICSU, International Council for 
Scientific Unions. That's international. The

27:07.135 --> 27:18.386
Intergovernmental Oceanographic Commission, 
the World Meteorological Organization, the Food

27:07.135 --> 27:18.386
and Agricultural Organization are technical 
bodies of the United Nations and are

27:07.135 --> 27:18.386
intergovernmental. When you go to one of those 
meetings as a member of the delegation, you speak

27:18.406 --> 27:26.333
for your nation and commit resources for your 
nation. When you go to an international meeting,

27:27.194 --> 27:29.456
you don't. You are gathering as a group of 
scientists to exchange ideas. So there's a big

27:36.430 --> 27:43.804
difference there.

27:43.824 --> 27:49.855
And you were active, really, in terms of 
international cooperation, and I assume still

27:43.824 --> 27:49.855
are from 1960 on. Did it seem to you that 
international cooperation blossomed and grew in

27:50.316 --> 27:54.243
this period? Well, it changed. A little difficult 
to explain when or how, but if we go back to 1953,

27:59.515 --> 28:21.724
1963, the International Cooperative 
Investigations of the Tropical Atlantic, that

27:59.515 --> 28:21.724
was the first of a series of intergovernmental 
oceanographic commission-coordinated

27:59.515 --> 28:21.724
activities. The intergovernmental... 
investigations of the Kirishio, the IIOE, the

28:24.052 --> 28:34.720
Intergovernmental Investigations of the Indian 
Ocean, the

28:37.349 --> 28:57.264
The CCAR, the IOC-coordinated cooperative 
investigations of the Caribbean and adjacent

28:37.349 --> 28:57.264
regions, that was in the descriptive 
oceanography phase when nations brought their

28:37.349 --> 28:57.264
resources together because no one nation could 
look at the whole tropical Atlantic at once. We

28:58.406 --> 29:01.551
don't do that anymore because we don't really need 
that anymore. I'm not saying we know enough about

29:02.290 --> 29:04.012
the oceans. I am saying that you no longer can 
generally bring together ships and scientists

29:04.072 --> 29:15.347
from six, eight, ten nations into these types of 
operations. We don't have the need or the

29:16.048 --> 29:17.630
resources. We're now beginning to look at the 
regional problems, and we're beginning to bring

29:18.472 --> 29:27.083
scientists together to look at things like a mole.
