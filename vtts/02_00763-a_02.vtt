WEBVTT

00:01.550 --> 00:06.859
Then I'd have to go to class, so I'd drop it in this 
container. Well, when the class was over and I went

00:07.961 --> 00:22.427
to the next class, I don't know how much space there 
might have been between classes, I'd get that

00:07.961 --> 00:22.427
cigar out and light it and smoke it until I got to the 
next class. And sometimes I'd still be smoking

00:23.318 --> 00:30.826
that cigar, that same cigar at 12 o'clock, going to 
that 12 o'clock class. It was pretty strong by that

00:30.926 --> 00:33.508
time. But I was a regular cigar smoker.

00:44.439 --> 00:48.684
But, of course, they smoked too many because I 
didn't have too much money. Well, you'd make one of

00:49.184 --> 00:50.966
them last all day then. Most of the day. What about 
chewing? Did a lot of the boys chew? Yeah. Yeah,

00:56.394 --> 00:57.054
they did. But they had a hard time. I think this will 
be an interesting incident. One of the classes

01:04.201 --> 01:08.946
that I enjoyed going to was Dr. Mark Francis' 
class. And sitting on this

01:20.845 --> 01:28.154
particular classroom was a circular classroom 
with elevated seats. And a boy from Miles Canale,

01:29.956 --> 01:38.867
he's down there, in the country where the Germans 
lived, you know. And so we decided we'd play the

01:40.229 --> 01:49.620
trick on old Miles Canale, because he'd shoot in 
tobacco classes. spit it out to one side, you know.

01:53.111 --> 01:59.218
And we didn't pay attention to it particularly, 
despite the fact we didn't like it. But Dr. Francis

01:59.238 --> 02:01.540
did.

02:03.663 --> 02:18.019
And so we decided we'd fill every seat except one 
and leave one for Miles Connolly on the front row in

02:03.663 --> 02:18.019
front of Dr. Francis. And so when class started, 
and old Miles started chewing on this plug at the

02:19.992 --> 02:32.366
back up. He didn't have any place to spit. And he 
looked over to the right and looked over to the

02:37.031 --> 02:44.299
left, and finally had to get rid of it somehow. So 
just whether it was right or left, I can't

02:44.419 --> 02:48.063
remember. But anyhow. Dr. Francis just got up and 
just like that went out of the room. He was

02:57.658 --> 02:59.260
wondering what was happening. And he came back 
with a five-gallon can, empty can, large can, and

03:01.241 --> 03:16.134
set it in front of Miles Canale and said, chew, and 
chew your head off. And that big can, you know, he

03:21.383 --> 03:35.324
That's the only experience we had about chewing 
tobacco in class.

03:35.364 --> 03:39.591
You mentioned Dr. Francis, and I think you said you 
were very fond of him. Was he one of your favorite

03:40.432 --> 03:42.415
teachers? Yes, he was. Who else were among your 
favorites? John C. Burns, I guess, was my

03:49.514 --> 03:55.302
favorite, top favorite. And then Dr. Francis. I 
thought an awful lot of Dr. Francis because I had a

03:56.603 --> 04:01.570
lot of humor. And he was just a good teacher.

04:12.263 --> 04:13.605
Any others that you can think of? Well, of course, 
I... I think of some others that I didn't like so

04:18.168 --> 04:20.711
well. Did

04:20.771 --> 04:26.760
you have any interesting experiences in 
chemistry? I've talked to a number of people who

04:26.820 --> 04:30.725
weren't fond of the chemistry department. Dr. 
Blake? No, I didn't have any trouble. I was good in

04:34.430 --> 04:36.172
chemistry, you see. And I helped my roommate get 
through A&M by tutoring in chemistry. He wasn't so

04:48.340 --> 04:52.285
hot in the sciences at all. And then, of course, 
then I had Dr. Ball in Putney. And I didn't

05:00.635 --> 05:15.293
particularly like Dr. Ball, but I didn't hate him, 
because he was always talking about when I was in

05:00.635 --> 05:15.293
Germany, we did so and so and so and so. Now, in 
English, I forget just now who we had in English,

05:16.387 --> 05:31.728
but apparently

05:16.387 --> 05:31.728
he didn't make any favorable impression on me. The 
only two was Burns and Francis, you see.

05:40.020 --> 05:45.347
One thing that interested me, and I went through 
the yearbook, 1915 when you graduated and I jotted

05:45.597 --> 06:03.998
down the organizations that you belonged to and 
the things you did and I guess I sort of had one kind

05:45.597 --> 06:03.998
of picture of you and I was interviewing some of 
your other colleagues and they referred to you as

05:45.597 --> 06:03.998
Runt Stangle. Right. And how do you

06:04.839 --> 06:13.849
reconcile your size with your great 
participation in intramural athletics. You

06:19.389 --> 06:21.571
played a lot of football and baseball, I see. Yeah, 
I did. I

06:24.535 --> 06:40.073
don't know, but I

06:24.535 --> 06:40.073
played football the first year on the IK team. I was 
too busy and finally decided I was just too busy to

06:41.015 --> 06:46.500
continue, so I quit. So I didn't finish my season as 
a

06:47.461 --> 06:55.449
freshman. As a sophomore, I played with I.K. I

07:00.974 --> 07:07.580
believe, let's see, in 13 you were on the C.D. That 
would have been your junior year, wouldn't it?

07:11.457 --> 07:19.289
Yeah, we had a championship team in 13. In 14, I was 
on the CD team. And I was captain, I think, as well as

07:27.501 --> 07:34.851
I remember, of the CD team.

07:36.714 --> 07:39.458
You also made the all-company football team as 
quarterback. Yeah. Was this a T-formation

07:40.887 --> 07:44.470
quarterback? No, it's a little silver football. 
That's what it is. You got a silver football for

07:52.057 --> 07:56.280
being on the all-company team. That was kind of the 
all-stars of the intramural. But according to

08:00.824 --> 08:05.168
your book, you were quarterback of the team. 
Right. Did you then play T-formation?

08:10.199 --> 08:12.762
That's where normally the quarterback played. 
No, we played what we'd call a regular formation,

08:12.782 --> 08:17.667
mostly. Now, this regular formation, you had a 
halfback here and a halfback here and a fullback

08:18.307 --> 08:26.255
here and a quarterback here in front. Right behind 
the center. Yeah. And he'd pass this halfback or

08:28.557 --> 08:36.105
this halfback or this fullback would go through. 
And there were times when he had a formation that we

08:36.777 --> 08:45.707
called eye formation. And it just lined back 
straight up, one behind the other, you see. That

08:54.376 --> 08:57.440
is, behind the line, you see. Today they call the 
eye formation when the running backs line up

08:57.460 --> 09:04.928
behind the quarterback in an eye.

09:07.068 --> 09:09.250
There were a number of other things I wanted to ask 
you about. You seem to have been a member of a number

09:10.071 --> 09:13.935
of organizations. One was the 466 Club. Do you 
remember that at all? No. I was not a member of the

09:20.682 --> 09:23.365
466 Club. I was president of the Agricultural 
Scientific Association. I don't know whether you

09:31.573 --> 09:35.117
got that down there or not. Well, yeah, there's the 
president of the SAA, the Scientific Agriculture

09:35.671 --> 09:39.596
Association. Yeah. Do you have any recollection 
of what the 466 Club was? No, I don't. Okay. What

09:50.230 --> 09:52.013
about the veterans of the Lost Cause?

09:55.117 --> 10:05.070
No, I didn't, because, let's see,

09:55.117 --> 10:05.070
was that after the war or before the war? Well, I 
don't know. There were a number of people who were

10:07.975 --> 10:15.342
there around 14, 15, and 16 who were veterans of the 
lost cause. And I have no idea what that was. Was

10:20.688 --> 10:24.692
that possibly an organization of senior 
privates? Now, senior privates. Now, I'm

10:25.853 --> 10:27.575
familiar with the senior privates. I was a member 
of the senior privates, yes. Now, the senior

10:30.078 --> 10:34.062
privates was just you might say a renegade outfit, 
you know, they didn't give them what they did, you

10:34.750 --> 10:39.099
know. Weren't not particularly wild about the 
military. And of course they were the ones that

10:41.404 --> 10:54.632
were not able to participate in the regular 
military events because of their jobs. For

10:55.304 --> 11:04.778
instance, I had to be at the horse barn at 5 o'clock 
in the morning and then run over to the mess hall and

10:55.304 --> 11:04.778
get breakfast to get there to an 8 o'clock crash, 
you know. Then I'd have to get there in the evening.

11:06.841 --> 11:14.533
We're talking

11:06.841 --> 11:14.533
about the senior privates. There's people who had 
jobs and therefore couldn't really meet the

11:18.946 --> 11:21.530
regular military formations. For instance, we'd 
drill between 12 and 1.

11:31.905 --> 11:35.089
Eat a quick bite, you know, and get out there and 
drill. Or sometimes not eat at all, you see. And

11:41.619 --> 11:46.506
then, of course, we didn't have any—well, we had 
uniforms as seniors, definitely designated as

11:46.874 --> 11:53.681
seniors.

11:56.164 --> 11:59.467
Militarily, we didn't rate.

12:03.151 --> 12:14.383
But I was recommended for an officer's rank by a lot 
of my friends. But the man who was commandant named

12:15.325 --> 12:20.070
Brown didn't like me. I've heard some people who 
had run in with Levi G. Brown. Did they? Well, I had.

12:26.858 --> 12:30.201
I wanted to go someplace. And he said, no, you can't 
go. And I argued with him. There wasn't any reason

12:38.911 --> 12:41.794
why I couldn't go. And I went. anyhow, you see, and 
that is the state affair. That sort of puts you on

12:51.612 --> 12:53.375
his blacklist. Yeah, I was on it, definitely on his 
blacklist, because when he came, when he was

12:53.395 --> 13:11.998
checking those who they were going to recommend 
for various officers for the following year, came

12:53.395 --> 13:11.998
across my name, mark right through it.

13:15.242 --> 13:15.522
Okay. I believe you also were in the Ross 
Volunteers. Right. So I was good enough to be in the

13:21.619 --> 13:30.571
Ross Volunteers, but not good enough to be an 
officer.

13:31.292 --> 13:36.179
There were also mentioned in the yearbook that you 
were in the Newman Club. Was that the Catholic

13:36.239 --> 13:40.605
men's organization as it is today? And also the 
Press Club. Yes. I was an athletic sports writer,

13:43.565 --> 13:53.138
so I was on the press club, you see. You wrote about 
the college athletics? Right. For what, the

13:57.805 --> 14:00.909
battalion or for other papers as well? Mostly for 
the battalion.

14:06.477 --> 14:10.904
Okay, and then you were also on the stock judging 
team for what, how many years? One or two? No, I was

14:12.522 --> 14:21.635
only one because the second year we didn't have a 
contest. I don't know whether you know the

14:22.637 --> 14:26.062
background of that or not. No. But I was a member of 
the junior livestock judging team. And as a member

14:35.175 --> 14:41.905
of the junior livestock judging team, I ranked for 
high place. on that team was a fellow named Scott

14:42.408 --> 14:47.734
from McKinney, Texas. He's dead, he's dead and 
gone now. And then that is the junior, junior

14:52.280 --> 14:58.707
livestock judging team. Now this junior 
livestock judging team competed in Fort Worth

14:58.727 --> 15:07.678
against teams from Oklahoma and Arkansas. And we 
won the contest, you see. And I, and I ran, and I, And

15:12.513 --> 15:18.279
I didn't rank first, so I tied for first and split 
the money. There was $75 that was first. Well,

15:22.303 --> 15:25.666
since I wasn't first, we split $75 and $50. And so 
that helped me a whole lot, because I sure needed

15:26.627 --> 15:34.815
the money.

15:34.835 --> 15:42.503
Then we were getting ready for the international 
glass dog judging team. developed

15:42.652 --> 16:05.292
foot and mouth

15:42.652 --> 16:05.292
disease

15:42.652 --> 16:05.292
in Mexico. And they wanted to keep it out of the 
United States. So they didn't take any chances.

16:13.212 --> 16:22.165
rid of any animal that had been exposed to any 
animals near the Mexico border, you see. And so

16:23.487 --> 16:31.218
they called off the International Livestock 
Judging Team just before to have been held. So I

16:32.059 --> 16:41.633
didn't get to go to Chicago to the International 
Livestock Judging Contest. And

16:43.267 --> 16:51.795
then would you be eligible for the stock judging 
team as a senior, or did they not have a team? No. We

16:53.316 --> 16:56.439
were through, you see. When we competed as a junior 
and then getting ready to compete as a senior, when

16:57.560 --> 17:12.193
that year—well, we were already packed ready to 
go. So we didn't go, so we were through. So I have, of

17:16.458 --> 17:28.190
course, the medal that they awarded to the senior 
members of the senior

17:16.458 --> 17:28.190
life. When you graduated in the spring of 1915, did 
you have a job all lined up by the time you

17:28.210 --> 17:37.399
graduated, or did you have to hunt for one after 
that? No. I had a scholarship.

17:44.742 --> 17:53.311
I had an opportunity to apply at the University of 
Missouri for an agricultural scholarship. And so

17:55.293 --> 18:03.823
I received a $200 agricultural

17:55.293 --> 18:03.823
scholarship. And so in September I went to 
Columbia, Missouri. do graduate work, and that's

18:10.966 --> 18:14.570
what I did my first year.

18:18.195 --> 18:23.762
Of course, I'll show you prices have soared. I 
roomed with a fellow named Darnell, who had been

18:25.945 --> 18:40.703
and then came back as an instructor in the

18:25.945 --> 18:40.703
dairy department.

18:42.033 --> 18:45.316
We ate in a place nearby. Our room was $10 a month for 
the two of us. And our meals were $5 for the week.

18:58.890 --> 19:00.072
All you could eat. $5 except Sunday. You didn't get 
a Sunday evening meal.

19:08.300 --> 19:10.302
And then that is it. And now when I graduated there 
in June, and my first job was an instructor in

19:11.041 --> 19:40.525
animal husbandry at Texas A&M that John Burns gave 
me following a statement made by Dr. Bezal who was

19:11.041 --> 19:40.525
visiting on the University of Missouri campus. 
campus when he asked me the question, Stangle, how

19:40.893 --> 19:49.345
would you like coming back to A&M? I said, I sure 
would like it. And that's what I did. So you came

19:53.811 --> 19:55.654
back there then in the fall of 16. 16. And you stayed 
at A&M until when? 25. 25.

20:06.121 --> 20:08.284
all the time in animal husbandry. Did you have any 
particularly outstanding students that you

20:08.565 --> 20:14.994
could remember from that time period? At A&M? At 
A&M?

20:22.285 --> 20:34.002
Yeah, I guess

20:22.285 --> 20:34.002
it was T. Burns, who was an outstanding student, 
Debbie T. Burns, He's owned in Laredo or down there

20:34.724 --> 20:39.310
somewhere. I forget now just where it is.

20:46.678 --> 20:47.139
K.J. Edwards was an outstanding student. But of 
course the most outstanding student was my

20:53.006 --> 21:02.217
roommate,

20:53.006 --> 21:02.217
John Bugbee. from Clarendon, Texas. He was, let's 
see, what are our grades? Anyhow, he was

21:14.490 --> 21:24.961
distinguished, that's right, distinguished 
every semester.

21:24.981 --> 21:27.023
And then in, say, 25 you took the job as head of the 
animal husbandry department at Texas Tech. That

21:31.650 --> 21:34.013
was the first year they had classes here then. Was 
that

21:35.314 --> 21:43.803
quite a step forward for you to move up as a 
department head even though it was a new school?

21:44.804 --> 21:45.885
Yeah, it was. And of course the person that was 
responsible for my coming here and taking the job

21:46.305 --> 21:53.973
was Dr. Francis. And that's the reason I rate him so 
high,

21:58.120 --> 22:03.968
because I didn't know what to do. See, I was offered 
this position here, and I had to make a decision

22:04.769 --> 22:17.307
about coming here. I'd visited here, and so

22:18.549 --> 22:27.942
I finally went to No. Proud of that. The entire 
freshman class, not freshman, junior class,

22:31.070 --> 22:50.858
animal husbandry, that is junior animal 
husbandry students, came to my home and were on my

22:31.070 --> 22:50.858
porch begging me not to go to A&M. I mean to Texas 
Tech, to stay at A&M. So it was a hard decision to

22:55.604 --> 22:57.507
make. and I had to make it by the next day.

23:04.253 --> 23:13.065
So I'd go to this fellow and that fellow there,

23:04.253 --> 23:13.065
asking him what to do. So it was Dr. Francis that 
made the decision for me.

23:21.697 --> 23:27.645
When I asked him the question, should I stay here or 
should I go to Texas Tech, He hesitated as he did in

23:29.600 --> 23:45.021
class many times, scratched his head, and then 
raised, I'd go.

23:45.041 --> 23:57.818
And he says, if after 10 years you have only one bull 
and a barbed wire fence around that bull, You know

23:59.671 --> 24:00.852
you've done it. And I figured that is a challenge. 
So I came here. And of course, it was a challenge,

24:10.922 --> 24:25.956
because I didn't have a thing, except 
tumbleweeds, goat heads,

24:10.922 --> 24:25.956
and blue weeds, and so on, things like that. It was 
really hard going. And at what point was it that you

24:30.991 --> 24:35.676
were then elevated to dean of agriculture? 1945. 
So 20 years as head of the department and then up to

24:38.159 --> 24:41.763
dean. And you retired then in what? 1958. 1958 you 
retired. And you've still been quite busy since

24:52.675 --> 24:58.101
then, though, haven't you? Yes, I have. Just the 
last few years, I've kind of slowed down, but I've

25:00.151 --> 25:04.537
been busy. I took a big part in getting this cattle 
feeding started here. I made four tours, planned

25:13.130 --> 25:15.834
four tours. By cattle feeding, you mean the 
feedlot operations? Feedlot operations, yeah.

25:24.346 --> 25:25.147
When did you do that? That was about early 1960s.

25:31.218 --> 25:36.785
And I believe you've been, what, chairman of the 
board of directors of the National Farm Life

25:31.218 --> 25:36.785
Insurance Company. Yes. Were you involved with 
that organization before you retired? Yes. In

25:47.278 --> 25:49.722
fact, I'm still with it, you see. Now,

25:49.742 --> 25:58.453
see, we started that in 1946. So you were then one of 
the founders of the? of this Farm Life Insurance

26:01.981 --> 26:03.983
Company? National Farm Life Insurance. National 
Farm Life. And is that associated with the

26:07.106 --> 26:11.210
Agricultural Workers Mutual Auto Insurance? 
Yes.

26:14.513 --> 26:17.996
In other words, one helps the other. In other 
words, a fellow will take out a policy and he may

26:18.057 --> 26:31.009
need some insurance. We find out that they needed 
some insurance, so we sell them some life

26:32.458 --> 26:36.887
insurance. So the two companies work nicely 
together. There are separate companies, though.

26:42.679 --> 26:45.705
Separate companies, yes. In the same building, of 
course.

26:51.357 --> 26:56.364
Do the agents for the company sell both kinds of 
insurance, or do you have separate agents for it?

26:56.484 --> 26:56.724
No. We don't. That's one thing. We do not have any 
auto agents. Uh-huh. Just like... In other words,

27:03.233 --> 27:07.338
if you want auto insurance with us, you have to 
apply. Do you have to be a farm worker to get auto

27:07.358 --> 27:11.844
insurance with you? You've got to be an 
agricultural worker, not a farm worker. Yeah,

27:17.172 --> 27:18.213
agricultural worker. I'm sorry. Yeah. Yeah. Uh, 
you have to be an agricultural worker to have the

27:19.977 --> 27:23.662
farm life insurance, too? No. No? Anybody can do 
it? Anybody. Were the two companies founded at the

27:28.990 --> 27:31.313
same time? No, at the, uh, order one year later.

27:44.872 --> 27:45.013
Uh-huh. And you're still then associated with 
both of them? Yeah, I am. I'll

27:48.624 --> 27:53.549
let you have these. OK. Now, you can have all of 
them. I've got more of them. All right, fine.

28:03.099 --> 28:12.649
There was a couple of incidents that occurred 
while you were there, either probably while you

28:03.099 --> 28:12.649
were on the faculty that I thought I might ask you 
about. One occurred in early 1917, I believe, this

28:17.572 --> 28:28.747
would probably have been during your first year of 
teaching, when a group of boys from A&M went over to

28:17.572 --> 28:28.747
Austin and branded the steer. Yeah. Do you have any 
recollection of that incident? Yeah, but I wasn't

28:33.553 --> 28:36.417
a part of it. I realize you weren't a part of it. You 
were on the faculty then.

28:45.029 --> 28:46.110
Then about... Three years later, as much as we can 
understand, that steer was butchered over in

28:46.850 --> 28:57.264
Austin, and they had a barbecue, and some people 
from A&M were invited. We have had indication that

28:58.846 --> 29:10.741
this was the case from an unidentified clipping 
and from an invitation, but I haven't been able to

28:58.846 --> 29:10.741
find anybody who actually remembers that there 
actually was a barbecue. Well, I don't remember a

29:12.283 --> 29:15.768
barbecue either. Mm-hmm. But you remember the 
branding incident?

29:22.475 --> 29:22.616
Yes. My assistant has talked with Hans Rohde, who 
wielded the branding on it. Yeah, Hans Rohde, a

29:29.692 --> 29:32.719
great baseball player.
