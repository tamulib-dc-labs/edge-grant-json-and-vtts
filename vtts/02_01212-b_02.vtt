WEBVTT

00:05.650 --> 00:06.611
Okay. And the youngest son, Billy, of course,

00:06.831 --> 00:35.522
he

00:06.831 --> 00:35.522
wasn't, because he had an old mean daddy that said 
what he thought, for various reasons, that being

00:06.831 --> 00:35.522
the principal one, he wasn't accepted into the 
school of veterinary medicine at A&M. Got his

00:35.992 --> 00:39.415
degree in animal science down there. I told him, I 
said, well, there are other ways to make a living

00:39.435 --> 00:44.500
besides running their medicine. He says, I'll 
decide if it takes me all my life, I'm going to be a

00:44.520 --> 00:48.223
veterinarian. I said, well, I'm going to spend all 
my life helping you. So he's accepted at the

00:52.387 --> 00:55.450
University of the Philippines. How he got in 
there, I don't know, but he was accepted out there.

01:00.694 --> 01:04.918
So we flew out there, and he went to the University 
of the Philippines for two years. And he'd just

01:05.995 --> 01:13.142
come back in after his second year out there, and 
the telephone rang one day. He said, this is Dr.

01:13.203 --> 01:17.627
Niemeyer at the University of Missouri.

01:21.451 --> 01:28.438
We have an opening up here, and we're offering you a 
position in the College of Veterinary Medicine.

01:28.458 --> 01:30.801
He said, well, I don't know, Dr. Niemeyer. I'm 
pretty happy where I am, but I'll come up and talk to

01:30.821 --> 01:33.283
you. He says, that's what I want you to do. So he went 
up there. and decided to enroll in the University

01:36.539 --> 02:05.517
of Missouri went through and in his senior year 
there's some lady up there that gives a little

01:36.539 --> 02:05.517
stipend to the outstanding equine veterinary 
student senior veterinary student and it's that

01:36.539 --> 02:05.517
student is selected by the professor and he was 
selected the outstanding equine veterinary

02:06.037 --> 02:11.144
student at the University of Missouri the year he 
graduated. And he came back here. I tell my Texas,

02:12.806 --> 02:21.157
you don't mind, I tell my Texas A&M friends that 
they did me a great favor. They made my son go to

02:21.217 --> 02:25.522
another school and get a good education. But 
anyway, he has come back here and he's done a

02:27.865 --> 02:32.972
tremendous job. He has in about, how long has he 
been back here? Three years? Four years? No, he's

02:38.708 --> 02:40.309
been back. Four years? No, he was married five 
years in July, so he's been back over five years.

02:46.636 --> 02:49.939
Well, he graduated in 81, didn't he? Or 80? 80. 80? 
All right. Well, he's been back five years. And I

02:55.224 --> 02:58.027
tell people he just messed up my practice. When he 
came back, I had my practice... I had it figured out

03:02.737 --> 03:11.150
where I was taking care of my friends and special 
people, and he came back and said, no, Dad, you're

03:02.737 --> 03:11.150
supposed to try to take care of everybody. And he's 
shriveled our practice. Shriveled it, yeah.

03:16.318 --> 03:20.745
Shriveled it, and he's, of course, he's brought in 
some young veterinarians with him. He has three

03:20.785 --> 03:22.567
other young veterinarians with him. Now, that's 
another thing. These young people communicate

03:24.811 --> 03:30.640
with this generation better than I do. Uh-huh, 
yeah. I don't know why. I don't know why. But they

03:34.470 --> 03:39.275
can sell them, and they can relate, and they 
communicate. He can just convince people, you

03:41.277 --> 03:52.710
know, if he decides this is what he's supposed to 
do, well, he can just tell them, and that's the way

03:41.277 --> 03:52.710
it goes. And sometimes they'll argue back and 
forth with me. He's just more convincing, just

03:55.413 --> 03:59.417
smarter, I guess. I guess it's his mother in him. 
Well, I do want to say to your favor, and I've always

04:02.305 --> 04:13.802
been impressed with individuals who are 
complimentary toward their parents. And I talked

04:14.904 --> 04:22.716
to him the other day, and first I apologized to him 
for calling him and, you know, interrupting his

04:14.904 --> 04:22.716
day and so forth and so on. He said, no problem. And 
then I told him what's that, and he was very

04:25.079 --> 04:28.244
complimentary of you both. And I think that that is 
a real... something that is very nice. Well, we

04:36.133 --> 04:38.778
appreciate that. And he's just alert, bright, to 
the point, pleasant, and all that sort of good

04:39.078 --> 04:48.114
thing. I'd like to ask, go ahead. We're very 
fortunate. We've never had any problem with

04:51.279 --> 04:53.343
either one of our boys. Well, that's wonderful. 
Sure have. Dub's quite a little younger than you

04:58.837 --> 05:00.599
are, isn't he? He is. Because he graduated in the 
50s. He is. There is about 15 years difference.

05:10.393 --> 05:10.994
That's a lot. Usually families aren't, you know, 
nowadays they have the three children and quit

05:12.015 --> 05:17.242
right then and there. That's right. That's right. 
Yes. I'd like to ask you two questions more or less

05:20.967 --> 05:26.835
in closing, plus anything else after that you may 
want to say. Do you have any observations on your

05:27.457 --> 05:34.123
year as president of the Texas Veterinary Medical 
Association?

05:36.965 --> 05:40.428
I wasn't president of the Texas Veterinary 
Medical Association. I was in the chairs. I think I

05:44.332 --> 05:48.576
was maybe first or second vice president. And I was 
elected to the board of the ABMA.

05:57.275 --> 06:07.269
I

05:57.275 --> 06:07.269
didn't go on through because I just didn't have the 
time.

06:13.218 --> 06:14.219
Well, you're certainly right. OK, my next 
question is going to be, what

06:15.041 --> 06:22.371
are your observations on your years I mean, I know 
it wasn't just one year, you know, you're

06:23.127 --> 06:31.177
president-elect, etc., etc., etc., but that's 
the year you get knocked around. Well, and you do.

06:35.842 --> 06:44.072
You run over a lot of people if you think you're 
doing what's right, you know, and you make enemies

06:35.842 --> 06:44.072
and friends, but... I wouldn't take anything for 
that year. It was a wonderful year, and I've made

06:48.340 --> 06:53.266
friends all over this country and foreign 
friends. What happened specifically? I wouldn't

06:55.569 --> 06:56.931
go through it again. What happened specifically? 
I mean, is there any highlight? Oh, I guess

07:00.436 --> 07:11.190
probably the highlight of my... My tenure, shall 
we say, as president of the ABMA was when I went to

07:11.761 --> 07:24.496
Washington and

07:11.761 --> 07:24.496
visited with President Kennedy. You were in the 
chair of the centennial year of the association.

07:31.043 --> 07:32.104
Yeah, that's right, too. That was the centennial 
year. You must have been 62 then, is that right? 62.

07:42.035 --> 08:01.294
We

07:42.035 --> 08:01.294
had asked Graham Purcell to introduce a 
resolution in Congress setting aside veterinary

07:42.035 --> 08:01.294
medical week because of our 100th anniversary. 
Why, he says, sure, I'll do that. And he got up

08:06.299 --> 08:10.843
there, and he found out that there hadn't been one 
of those things put through Congress Franklin

08:11.667 --> 08:35.093
Roosevelt's days and he didn't let that deter him 
he just kept on and I appeared before two or three a

08:11.667 --> 08:35.093
Senate committee and a House committee too

08:11.667 --> 08:35.093
requesting this and

08:38.212 --> 08:48.547
Oh, I had old Senator Dirksen on my side, and gosh, I 
made a lot of friends up there, and we got the darn

08:38.212 --> 08:48.547
thing passed. We don't know how. Well, that was a 
highlight. She brought it up, too. We don't know

08:52.653 --> 08:54.917
how it happened. Well, that's tremendous. But we 
got that thing passed, and we were in New York at the

08:56.179 --> 09:08.016
AVMA meeting, and Graham was down there. He was 
attending with us. We had asked him to come down.

09:12.933 --> 09:20.446
And he had a call that the president was going to 
sign this proclamation the next morning at 9

09:12.933 --> 09:20.446
o'clock in Washington, D.C. So he and I got on a 
commuter plane and flew to Washington.

09:27.058 --> 09:31.185
And I had one of these little...

09:32.903 --> 09:37.228
knick-knack things, commemorative outfit. 
Medallion. Medallion. That's what I was trying to

09:38.871 --> 09:40.072
say. Commemorating our 100th. ABMA medallion. 
Yeah. Centennial medallion. Centennial

09:45.559 --> 09:46.380
medallion. That's what it was. So I was carrying it 
with me, and I was afraid when we walked into the

09:48.823 --> 09:55.912
White House that they'd shake us down and take it 
away from us, but nobody said anything. We walked

09:55.952 --> 10:00.598
in, and they took us into the Senate room first, the 
cabinet room first, and we sat down there, and

10:01.287 --> 10:14.086
there was some John Kennedy matches, so we both got 
us a box of John Kennedy matches. And then here

10:14.106 --> 10:30.450
comes an old boy, I thought he was a janitor or 
somebody, and he took us into the fish room, and he

10:14.106 --> 10:30.450
says, now, I said, that's a beat-up old desk right 
there, and he said, yeah, that's a desk that the

10:32.438 --> 10:43.089
that President Kennedy's father gave him when he 
was elected to

10:32.438 --> 10:43.089
the legislature, when he was in the House, I 
believe. And I says, what's that old deer head over

10:45.531 --> 10:49.195
there? And he said, that's the deer that President 
Kennedy killed on Vice President Johnson's ranch

10:49.215 --> 10:56.843
last fall. I said, well, that's the best. That's 
the best job I ever saw on a head like that. Mounting

11:10.152 --> 11:10.953
a deer head? Mounting. I said, that's the best 
mounting I ever saw on him. Because I said, you

11:14.677 --> 11:19.583
know, there's just no signs of those rope burns on 
that neck. Well, he didn't think that was very

11:22.186 --> 11:23.908
funny. Come to find out, he was the president's 
secretary about the second... one second

11:30.353 --> 11:33.056
secretary down. So we walked out of there and we 
started down the hall to the Rose Room and there was

11:33.076 --> 11:42.287
that old skin-headed boy and I said, hell, I've 
seen that old boy. And I walked up and shook hands

11:42.327 --> 11:45.550
with him. I said, I'm Dan Anderson. He says, I'm 
Dean Rusk. Dean Rusk. Secretary of State. Yeah,

11:51.517 --> 11:53.720
Secretary of State. And I turned to old Graham and I 
said, these sure are friendly people. He says, oh,

12:00.671 --> 12:06.198
yeah, they don't have anything to worry about 
except when somebody's going to drop an atomic

12:00.671 --> 12:06.198
bomb on us or something like that. That's about all 
they have to worry about. So I walked on down into

12:08.280 --> 12:20.615
the room and introduced me to Kennedy, and he sat 
down and took about a half a dozen pens to sign that

12:08.280 --> 12:20.615
thing. Did you? Oh, yeah. Hope you still have it. 
Yeah, we still have it somewhere. And... So I'd

12:28.150 --> 12:33.956
asked Graham, I said, now, when do I give this thing 
to him? And I don't know, you may not get a chance to.

12:36.979 --> 12:38.621
Well, I says, yeah, I'll get a chance to. And he was 
in the back in the middle of his writing, and I said,

12:39.141 --> 12:56.419
well, Mr. President, I know you get a lot of this 
kind of crap, but we sincerely want you to have it as

12:39.141 --> 12:56.419
a token of our appreciation for what you've done, 
or something like that. Later,

12:56.973 --> 13:06.146
Graham said, no you didn't say crap, it was even 
worse, you said junk.

13:11.133 --> 13:20.466
So then I got to talking to the president about his 
wife's little dog and we visited there a few

13:11.133 --> 13:20.466
minutes. And Graham was embarrassed and he walked 
off. And he says, you know, I turned and looked and

13:25.249 --> 13:29.434
the president had his arm around Ben's shoulder.

13:33.679 --> 13:41.769
And we finally left and he says, you've 
embarrassed me so it'll take me a year to get back in

13:33.679 --> 13:41.769
this place. I said, Graham, I ain't coming back. I 
had to get everything I wanted. While you were

13:47.816 --> 13:48.757
here? Oh, yeah, yeah. And another... Another 
thing that I wasn't supposed to, we had the

13:52.070 --> 14:00.820
president's picture on our brochure, you know, 
for the centennial meeting. And I said, Mr.

14:01.300 --> 14:09.950
President, I sure would like to have your 
autograph on it to Dr. Dan Anderson with regards,

14:01.300 --> 14:09.950
John F. Kennedy. And I said, you know, I have two 
boys. I've just got to have another one. I got

14:15.172 --> 14:23.560
two of his autographs, and you're not supposed to 
ask the president for his autograph. Oh, is that

14:23.600 --> 14:24.361
right? I just found it out, but I got it. Yeah, old 
Graham says, you've messed me up so it'll take me a

14:28.826 --> 14:32.770
year to get back here. Well, I'll tell you, the only 
thing you could have done for Graham that would

14:32.790 --> 14:41.078
have improved the whole situation, you should 
have invited the president to Dallas.

14:44.770 --> 14:48.594
We've got an awful nice city called Dallas down 
there in Texas. We'd just be dying to have you come

14:48.614 --> 14:51.157
down. But somebody else took care of that. Someone 
else. I guess LBJ invited him over. Yeah. Well,

14:58.866 --> 15:01.249
those were wonderful. That was certainly a 
highlight. You know, wasn't it quite a strain? You

15:09.458 --> 15:12.482
remember, who was our AVMA president? Our 
president and... treasure for so long, uh, uh, was

15:14.960 --> 15:21.036
in Minnesota then moved to Washington. Oh, uh, oh, 
oh, name's right on the tip of my tongue. The, you

15:28.460 --> 15:30.002
mean the treasure? Yes, he was AVMA treasure for 
several years. Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah. He was from

15:33.387 --> 15:34.648
Minnesota. He's a good friend of mine, and he died 
here. About three or four years ago. Don, Don...

15:38.874 --> 15:41.458
Spangler. Don Spangler. Yeah. He was a real nice 
fella, and he came down here and addressed the

15:43.501 --> 15:51.492
AVMA, the TVMA, in 65 when I took over. Yeah. And I, 
after we finished, I said, Don, you look beat. I

15:58.008 --> 16:00.590
said, are you going to be busy for a couple days? And 
he says, well, yeah. He says, I've got to get back up

16:01.791 --> 16:05.695
to the snowdrift, but I don't have to be there until 
the day after tomorrow. And I said, why don't you

16:06.896 --> 16:13.001
come on down to the son of Mac Allen and just rest for 
a little bit? And he says, that's us. You know, we

16:13.942 --> 16:15.523
met in Corpus Christi. He said, that's a splendid 
idea. I said, okay, we'll meet down there, and

16:17.725 --> 16:25.371
we'll put you up in the Holiday Inn and just come on 
down. So he came down there and checked in, and in

16:28.028 --> 16:39.045
about ten minutes he was dressed out in the sun on 
one of those chaise lounges, you know, that they

16:28.028 --> 16:39.045
have out there around the swimming pool. And I 
said, you know, we want to show you around the

16:39.065 --> 16:49.301
valley here, so as soon as you finish here and get 
your clothes on, we'll take you a little tour. And

16:50.082 --> 16:50.543
he says, You aren't going to do any such thing. He 
says, I'm just going to sit out here this afternoon

16:52.368 --> 16:56.736
and I'm going to soak up this sun. I'm going to 
forget about all those snowdrifts and I'm going to

16:56.796 --> 17:03.527
relax so I can go back to the snow and see a few more 
meetings. He says, but, if you will, please. If you

17:06.993 --> 17:18.753
would take my Chrysler down to the Chrysler agency 
and get this and this and this and this done,

17:06.993 --> 17:18.753
because every place I've gone, you know, it was all 
snowed in underneath, and they couldn't do

17:06.993 --> 17:18.753
anything with it. And he says, I want you to get the 
oil chains and grease, the alignment fixed and all

17:18.773 --> 17:23.561
that sort of thing. Could you do that for me? And I 
said, yeah, sure can. So I went down there. It took

17:27.828 --> 17:30.452
all afternoon to get all that done, you know, and I 
brought it back. And I says, Don, what can I do for

17:31.107 --> 17:33.129
you? And he says, you've done it all for me. He says, 
I just feel wonderful. He says, I'm just ready to go

17:36.913 --> 17:40.037
back after it again. So that was kind of the way it 
was during your year, wasn't it? Oh, yeah. Yeah, it

17:43.660 --> 17:44.722
was hectic. I would fly out of here and make 
meetings. And then I would come back, and they'd

17:49.266 --> 17:58.296
have things

17:49.266 --> 17:58.296
stacked up. The boys wouldn't try to take care of 
it. They'd say, well, now Dr. Anderson's out of

18:00.887 --> 18:06.736
town, but he'll be back here Tuesday, and we'll set 
you up for Tuesday. All right, that's fine. I would

18:09.060 --> 18:12.145
fight it for a few days, and then I was gone again. 
But I wouldn't take anything for it. It is a

18:15.751 --> 18:16.993
wonderful experience. But like I say, I wouldn't 
do it again at all. Well, AVMA was 100 years old

18:20.017 --> 18:24.705
then, and it's a lot older now. You know, old Dick 
Turk told me I had just been elected in Detroit. And

18:32.942 --> 18:35.926
naturally, I... He was on the board for a long time. 
Yes, yes. He followed me on the board, too. And I was

18:40.493 --> 18:41.614
writing notes. Well, I've got to do this, I've got 
to do that. He said, Dan, how old is this? I said,

18:46.221 --> 18:54.793
man, it's going to be 100 years old next year, and 
I've got a lot of things to do here, a lot of things to

18:46.221 --> 18:54.793
think about, centennial celebration and all that 
stuff. He said, just relax.

19:02.078 --> 19:04.462
You can't possibly destroy it in two years. He 
said, just relax. You can't possibly destroy it in

19:10.274 --> 19:12.278
two years. Dan, isn't it a shame that we didn't sit 
down and get a two-hour interview from him? Back

19:17.656 --> 19:23.210
before, you know, he wasn't the same Turk the last 
five or ten years. No, no. You're talking about the

19:24.874 --> 19:26.358
original. Yeah, the original Dick Turk. He was 
sick the last ten years. Yeah, yeah.

19:32.052 --> 19:32.674
Unfortunately. You know... He should never have 
been re-elected to that board up there as a second

19:33.957 --> 19:38.581
term. He was not in physical condition or mental 
condition to do it, but I wasn't one to say. You

19:44.847 --> 19:50.732
know, we'd been friends all those years, and he 
wanted to go back, and I said, well, what the hell.

19:51.893 --> 19:54.416
Don't you think Charlie Huff was pretty good for 
TVMA?

19:59.641 --> 19:59.761
Uh-uh. He might have been good for TVMA, but he 
wasn't worth a darn for me. And I'll tell you what. I

20:06.467 --> 20:07.970
would... I'll tell you what I'd do. I'd recommend 
it. I told him at the time I'd recommend him for any

20:12.640 --> 20:21.558
other job than anybody else, but I thought he ought 
to be out of the TV and that. Is that back in 62? No.

20:24.184 --> 20:25.767
No, Charlie Huff. They didn't. Just here, just 
before they fired him. Oh, I'm talking about

20:31.728 --> 20:32.970
recently. Yeah. But you know, he was there for 17 
years. And he got worse all the time. I don't know

20:42.745 --> 20:47.232
what Charlie... quiet charlie did it but he 
screwed me around about three or four times and

20:47.515 --> 21:16.577
without any reason about the last year he was there 
and finally i just got on his tail and and uh oh uh

20:47.515 --> 21:16.577
several little things and finally they made me an 
honorary life member what do they call it and sent

20:47.515 --> 21:16.577
me a certificate and didn't even sign

20:47.515 --> 21:16.577
it which it didn't make any difference you know but 
uh uh uh

21:17.907 --> 21:36.169
in the beginning yes in the beginning i i think 
charles uh charlie uh probably did an outstanding

21:17.907 --> 21:36.169
job but uh as all executive secretaries do 
eventually they get to where they I guess we bring

21:36.841 --> 21:41.968
it on them because we allow them to do this. They get 
to where it's, I'm doing this and I'm running this.

21:47.155 --> 21:50.720
Not for the board, I'm doing it, you know, I'm doing 
it. And eventually they'll make enough people

21:51.862 --> 21:57.429
mad, like he did me, that they'll have to move on. 
That's the story of executive secretaries. Well,

22:03.357 --> 22:06.662
my only complaint was that I think Executive 
secretaries are never supposed to last that long,

22:07.132 --> 22:10.796
you know. It's just like city managers. Yeah, 
yeah. 10 years is probably the top, and 12 years is

22:14.719 --> 22:20.505
too much, and 15 is way too much. That's right, 
that's right. But,

22:22.727 --> 22:30.255
well, looking back on your practice life, what do 
you think of it? Well, if I had it to do over again, I

22:30.275 --> 22:33.338
wouldn't change it a whole lot. I've been greatly 
blessed. I really have. I'm not a wealthy person,

22:39.103 --> 22:45.830
but I've made some good investments. I got 
involved in a little old bank out here 20 or 25 years

22:46.370 --> 22:54.719
ago and made investments in it. And then I

22:54.979 --> 23:03.227
got in involved with Texas phenethiazine, and it 
eventually worked out all right. In fact, I just

23:09.634 --> 23:12.799
got paid off. We sold that thing on credit. I just 
got my money last fall. But anyway, all in all, and

23:18.027 --> 23:26.160
my practice, I just...

23:26.815 --> 23:28.938
wouldn't change my practice a whole lot. I've got 
friends, I've got acquaintances, I've got

23:28.978 --> 23:37.771
clients that have been doing business for 40 
years, and I've got... I worked for the father, I

23:37.791 --> 23:45.683
worked for the... Then I worked for the son, and 
then I'm now working for the grandchildren. For

23:45.703 --> 23:46.604
the grandchildren, yeah. And... Oh, we haven't 
made everybody happy, but we... I'll... I'm not

23:55.739 --> 23:57.850
ashamed of the crowd I'm running with. Well, 
that's wonderful.
