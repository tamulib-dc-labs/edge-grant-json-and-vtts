WEBVTT

00:02.427 --> 00:17.567
And you would be surprised how many newspapers and 
radio stations call me from all over the United

00:02.427 --> 00:17.567
States calling me a male chauvinist pig and what in 
the world was wrong. And why in the world can you be

00:18.104 --> 00:20.249
that? And ladies' organizations. And it was a very 
trying experience. And you'd go, so I'd go to a golf

00:27.084 --> 00:32.355
tournament, and my girl's going to play the first 
ball there, and there's somebody yelling over

00:27.084 --> 00:32.355
there. And it was terrible. Just five years of 
harassment, and it was bad. uh all right five years

00:39.164 --> 01:03.433
i think it was five years before it started before 
it was over oh okay see they postponed it yes it may

00:39.164 --> 01:03.433
not have been i don't know at all i don't remember 
though i try to forget it i'm not going to ask the

00:39.164 --> 01:03.433
negative the positive uh who uh in the 
administration you mentioned colas who else

00:39.164 --> 01:03.433
deserves credit for being supportive of your 
effort to try to dr vanderbilt

01:06.029 --> 01:07.672
I could tell you a little incident happened. I 
won't tell you, but I'm not over this thing, but

01:07.692 --> 01:11.357
I'll tell you. I'm telling you. So I'm correct in 
understanding then that you believe that Dr.

01:13.741 --> 01:21.893
Frank Vandiver, then the president, deserves a 
lot of credit. He deserves, in my, Dr. Vandiver and

01:22.134 --> 01:32.149
Dr. Colas, and of course the commandant, he's been 
for it for some time. I believe his name was Burton

01:32.590 --> 01:34.112
at the time. All right, then the first time the 
Aggie band goes on the field with women, how many

01:34.193 --> 01:41.107
were out there? Maybe three or four, and you could 
not tell they were there. That's what I heard from a

01:46.839 --> 01:48.803
number of people. Everybody in the stands was 
trying to pick out the girls. They couldn't do it.

01:53.152 --> 01:55.797
They saw there was one little short one there that, 
Stretching her legs out pretty good. She was a

01:58.513 --> 02:11.676
flute player, but had her hair all day and she would 
the same thing and they still do it and now I think

01:58.513 --> 02:11.676
they have 35 right and they were They like the men 
wear slacks with same suit not skirt the same

02:12.179 --> 02:30.314
thing, and I think they wear, when they go to corps 
dances and things, I think they wear the same thing

02:12.179 --> 02:30.314
as the women in the corps wear, their uniforms, but 
when they're marching on the field, they wear the

02:12.179 --> 02:30.314
same thing with their hair pinned up, and they're 
good. Listen, women can play. In my high school

02:32.496 --> 02:38.761
bands, we had some great bands, and about 50% of 
them were girls. After that first year, uh did

02:41.744 --> 03:01.609
everyone then seem to accept it it went after that 
they there was just some that didn't like it and we

02:41.744 --> 03:01.609
we had very few incidences the first year did you uh 
have to ever have to deal with any uh harassment or

02:41.744 --> 03:01.609
hazing well not anything real serious there were 
you'd have to call one in there now this way it is and

03:02.095 --> 03:25.099
you go do it or else you're going to be in trouble and 
they'd go do it you know they were just that

03:02.095 --> 03:25.099
dedicated and and and uh i in my personal opinion i 
could never see as a parent if i were a parent

03:02.095 --> 03:25.099
sending a daughter in there it's a man's band but 
you know then they moved them into the dorm you know

03:26.885 --> 03:54.715
with them and they they went in there one summer i 
was against that and i always will be i agree with

03:26.885 --> 03:54.715
you uh and they they went in there and they spent 
thirty five thousand dollars and fixed up a a

03:26.885 --> 03:54.715
restroom and they the first they moved them down on 
the end had their own little section but then that

03:26.885 --> 03:54.715
meant that all the boys on that section had to go 
somewhere to take a shower so you know i Uh I just uh

03:56.281 --> 04:25.107
but I was not told and was not in on that so that's 
that's here and there but uh uh I just I felt like we

03:56.281 --> 04:25.107
did it smoothly and I felt like it was something 
that wasn't a matter of what we wanted it was a

03:56.281 --> 04:25.107
matter of what the the government was going to make 
you do then the Civil Liberties Union came down

03:56.281 --> 04:25.107
here and interviewed us and and and uh grilled us 
down and And they asked why I object to it. I said,

04:27.311 --> 04:34.504
you put young men and young women in the same 
building, doing the same things all the time, and

04:27.311 --> 04:34.504
things are going to happen that would not normally 
happen. And I don't think that's right. And they

04:37.288 --> 04:39.613
couldn't understand that either. But I didn't 
care whether they understood it or not. That's

04:41.536 --> 04:42.758
just the way it is. Did any regents attempt to 
intervene and directly tell you what to do? Not

04:49.791 --> 04:50.692
that I know of. Good, good. No, I didn't hear one 
thing from them other than that one request we

04:52.255 --> 05:00.369
talked about, which was kind of a stab in the night, 
I think. All right, let's shift to some lighter

05:01.030 --> 05:03.615
moments. Can you share some anecdotes about some 
of the tricks, some of the good bulls, some of the

05:04.085 --> 05:15.214
pranks that band members played on each other? 
Yeah, they... Somebody was always in the core, you

05:19.424 --> 05:29.185
know, they were always coming over there and 
driving on our football, on our practice field

05:19.424 --> 05:29.185
with the cars and making big tracks and things like 
that. And they'd put sheep stuff and pig stuff and

05:29.966 --> 05:39.627
chicken stuff in there so it would smell bad for a 
long time and everything. They would do things

05:39.607 --> 05:52.047
like that, but one of the best stories that I can 
remember is the last year I was there, we went to

05:39.607 --> 05:52.047
Arkansas. And about 2 o'clock in the morning, the 
manager of the motel knocked on my door and said,

05:52.837 --> 05:59.252
Colonel, get up, get up. You've got to come out 
here. I said, well, what in the world does it

05:59.973 --> 06:01.497
matter? It's 2 o'clock in the morning. He said, 
that doesn't matter. Come out here. You've got to

06:03.561 --> 06:04.183
see this. He said, there's a bunch of your seniors 
around there climbing up the trellis on the side of

06:04.744 --> 06:10.197
the motel. They said they're going all the way to 
the top. So I go out there, and I'm telling you,

06:12.884 --> 06:16.027
that's what it was. It rose trellis, and they were 
halfway up. And so I looked up there, and I said,

06:19.811 --> 06:22.913
what are you guys doing? And they said, well, we're 
just having fun. I said, you get down over there,

06:25.796 --> 06:30.401
and you go to your room, and we'll talk about it 
Monday. Right now it's 2 o'clock in the morning.

06:32.382 --> 06:36.947
The man is scared for a lot of insurance reasons and 
other reasons, and you get down and go to your room.

06:36.967 --> 06:37.427
And they did. I called them in Monday. We had our 
talk. So when we were going to the inaugural

06:41.842 --> 06:50.635
parade, I told them, I said, now I want to tell you 
guys one thing. When we go up there, we're going to

06:52.097 --> 06:59.327
all be staying in the same motel for three nights. 
If I hear of one lamp broken, one towel taken, one

07:00.640 --> 07:16.573
wash rag missing, or one disturbance call, I don't 
care who you are and you will be in Virginia You will

07:17.279 --> 07:20.985
be on a bus at your own expense going home. You will 
not perform in the parade, and you will not march

07:21.867 --> 07:27.657
with this band. Do we understand that? Yes, sir. 
Okay. So we go up there, and we go through the three

07:30.883 --> 07:36.773
days, march in the parade. We're getting back on 
the bus to go to the airplanes, and they were in New

07:38.423 --> 07:43.988
York. And this guy said, Colonel Haney. I said, 
yes, can I see you in a minute? He said, I'm Mr.

07:49.532 --> 07:52.215
So-and-so. I'm the manager of this motel. I said, 
oh, God. So he said, you know, when I first got this

07:55.658 --> 08:07.688
call that we were keeping 315 members of the 
Fighting Texas Aggie Band, I was disturbed. But he

08:07.668 --> 08:11.512
says, you know, they were here three days. There 
was not one lamp broken, not one towel was taken,

08:11.812 --> 08:20.942
not one wash rag was missing, and I did not have one 
disturbance call. And he said, that is a record.

08:24.566 --> 08:28.229
And he said, any time you guys want to stay here, 
you're welcome. So, now that's, to me, that's what

08:28.970 --> 08:34.536
it's all about. Now, did ever any band members 
attempt to play any trick on you? Not very. Well,

08:43.544 --> 08:44.686
I'll tell you what. Let me tell you one other story. 
When I first came, the first year I was in in 73, I was

08:46.829 --> 08:58.667
up in the top floor up there is where I stay, and I was 
looking out and there was a big tree that grows all

08:46.829 --> 08:58.667
the trees all around the drill field. And this one, 
I said, I didn't have my off button. My on button,

09:02.573 --> 09:04.435
off button was on. And so I said, you know, that 
dadgum tree is getting so big that I can't see half

09:04.816 --> 09:09.923
the band. And I didn't think any more about it. The 
next day I went out there and I said, there's

09:11.405 --> 09:15.691
something wrong. That tree was gone. They took it 
right down to the nub of the trunk. And it was not a

09:25.445 --> 09:28.650
leaf in place. Everything was gone. Nobody 
mentioned it to me, nothing. And I could see half

09:35.080 --> 09:37.504
the band. So I said, oh my Lord, what have I done? And 
so Mr. Ray, Eugene Ray, was the groundsman, and

09:40.949 --> 09:50.524
those trees were his children. And it took him 
about two weeks to find it, to see it, notice it. I

09:59.323 --> 10:01.125
guess he drove by or something and saw it. So he 
didn't go to see John Coles, he went to see the

10:01.285 --> 10:05.691
president, Dr. Williams. And so John called me a 
day or so later and said, Joe, we got trouble. I

10:11.538 --> 10:12.139
said, what's wrong? He said, man, there's a $4,000 
tree that those boys have cut down. He said, do you

10:16.064 --> 10:18.767
know anything about it? I said, John, all I can tell 
you is that the tree is gone. And he said, well, I

10:23.612 --> 10:26.155
said, I couldn't see the band. I told him my story. 
He said, well, don't worry about it. I'll take care

10:28.939 --> 10:29.539
of it. That's the last I heard about the tree. But 
now, they must have stayed up most of the night.

10:35.086 --> 10:35.226
Mm-hmm. And I told them one afternoon after band I 
said I can't back my car up, there's a car behind me

10:35.746 --> 10:45.380
and I've got to go home, it's 7 o'clock. I said sir 
we'll take care of it and they've got a hundred of

10:45.740 --> 10:51.548
them over there and moved, picked that car up and 
put it on the sidewalk and left it. I mean that's

10:51.569 --> 10:54.733
just the kind. Not often did they. Had one guy could 
imitate me real good, and one of the band dancers,

10:55.995 --> 11:01.684
he did that. And I've got a picture of it in there. I 
used to put my head up here or something, and he had

11:03.687 --> 11:09.657
my mannerisms down to better than I did. And I 
thought that was so funny. And we all got a big kick

11:12.041 --> 11:14.224
out of that. Let's see, of all of the, I'll say 
tunes, to be as inclusive as possible, of all of the

11:15.065 --> 11:28.582
tunes, all the musical numbers that the band 
played, did you have a favorite? Well, I just loved

11:28.602 --> 11:31.225
the Stars and Stripes. Stars and Stripes Revival. 
Yeah, and I loved, they really used to do it, of

11:32.867 --> 11:41.258
course I love the old men, they do that so well, and 
they do a great job on the National Emblem.

11:41.238 --> 11:55.315
strategic air command and we had we had so many and 
of course that old battle hymn thing we did that was

11:41.238 --> 11:55.315
that was really something he stopped that a minute 
I mean go in this restroom and I'll be right back.

11:57.938 --> 12:04.866
Before we leave the Aggie Band Association has 
just made a CD of the two albums that Vern made and

12:06.770 --> 12:11.537
the four that I made. It's two CDs and I want you to 
have the packet. And they really are good. And I

12:18.587 --> 12:29.503
think if you'll listen you can see how it never did 
really change except there's a little evolution

12:18.587 --> 12:29.503
there you can tell. Now, in the halftime routine,

12:29.737 --> 12:40.411
always began with the war hymn and always ended 
with the spirit. No, not at the halftime. didn't

12:43.388 --> 13:04.620
play they don't play the spirit at the halftime 
they usually they usually end it with uh some kind

12:43.388 --> 13:04.620
of a march or something uh with the block t yeah with 
the block that's in the war here that's right yeah

12:43.388 --> 13:04.620
yeah all right uh then uh about in that halftime 
about how many other were normally played every

13:04.600 --> 13:10.047
time during the halftime. Were there any others? 
You can usually, if you go with the war hymn, you can

13:12.650 --> 13:17.757
cut that off depending on how much. But sometimes 
you'll just come out of the north end zone and then

13:18.899 --> 13:26.849
you'll go into something else that would require, 
change the mood a little bit. And you can sometimes

13:27.410 --> 13:29.512
do three other tunes. And you can do more than that 
if you just play a portion of them. So you really

13:34.064 --> 13:44.435
need quite a variety, but see they have to memorize 
all those things, and they usually just want to

13:34.064 --> 13:44.435
play the ones, and they'll get lazy if you let them. 
Now during the course of the football season,

13:44.455 --> 13:54.746
about how many different numbers will they 
perform in a year?

13:55.147 --> 13:59.291
We used to pass out forty-five tunes. Oh, that 
many. I don't think they do that anymore. They

14:02.954 --> 14:04.796
don't play quite that many anymore. But we would 
play a number in the stands. We did a lot at the

14:10.741 --> 14:12.162
pregame. We played quite a bit. And we would try to 
do some different tunes every week. We might do

14:17.006 --> 14:24.713
during the process a year, do Noble Men twice 
maybe, and then some different finale every time.

14:25.514 --> 14:29.297
But we would play most of those tunes during the 
football season. Of course, some of them were

14:29.317 --> 14:32.320
basketball season. And we played jazz when I was 
there in the basketball game some, and like the

14:32.975 --> 14:38.283
Saints go marching in and things like that. But 
they've cut the band out now, and they have about

14:39.004 --> 14:48.317
forty I think, and there's no more national 
anthem. There's no more spirit I don't think. I

14:50.521 --> 14:51.121
don't know. I haven't been. And they have a dance 
team, I believe, with the rock tape. That to me is

14:58.278 --> 15:02.422
not our tradition. I'll tell you an interesting 
story on that one. They changed that about the day I

15:04.364 --> 15:08.108
left because I wouldn't change it. Let's see. The 
title, Fightin' Texas Aggie Band, what does that

15:13.773 --> 15:19.439
fightin' mean? I'm not real sure. Because I've 
noticed that in all of the bands that we play,

15:23.566 --> 15:36.166
anywhere, Southwest Conference, anywhere, that 
our band is the best-mannered bunch of the whole

15:23.566 --> 15:36.166
deal. We stay in there. We mind our own business. We 
very seldom ever have any trouble because we did

15:38.670 --> 15:44.019
not allow any trouble. But I understand in days 
gone by, there have been some fights. now I think

15:48.760 --> 16:14.211
one here one one let's see about two three years ago 
they got some they put the Aggie band and the Texas

15:48.760 --> 16:14.211
band on the field at the same time at Texas and they 
had some altercations and with with the Texas band

15:48.760 --> 16:14.211
and the football team and eight or ten of the 
seniors walked off they wouldn't get on there and

15:48.760 --> 16:14.211
uh they they asked I've had a number of them call me 
and I asked me I said you need to do what the

16:14.562 --> 16:39.625
southwest conference rules say you can do and just 
tell them you got eight minutes i'm gonna be on

16:14.562 --> 16:39.625
there and off in eight minutes and you do whatever 
you want to the rest of the time and you won't have

16:14.562 --> 16:39.625
any trouble at all but uh because we always went 
right back to the stands and got back up in there so

16:14.562 --> 16:39.625
we we just didn't have any i don't ever recall 
having any really unpleasant experiences at a

16:40.415 --> 16:42.618
game while I was here. Because to me, I assumed that 
word, fighting, didn't mean physical

16:42.819 --> 16:48.948
encounters. It meant striving, trying. That's 
the way I interpret that, too. Hardworking. I

16:54.537 --> 16:55.798
interpret it that way. I think like dedication and 
hard work and talent and They're striving to do

17:01.070 --> 17:02.432
that.

17:05.556 --> 17:10.022
But I think in years past they've had some 
altercations.

17:12.826 --> 17:15.189
I've got only two or three questions left. What 
have I not touched on? Well, we've hit it around

17:18.333 --> 17:21.357
there pretty good, haven't we? All right, then if 
you don't think of anything else, these

17:21.337 --> 17:26.204
questions. Who are some people that you'd like to 
thank? Express appreciation and record it.

17:34.337 --> 17:36.420
Golly knows there's so many of them. I just really 
wouldn't know where to start. I think the first guy

17:38.243 --> 17:46.034
that was, of course, I'd like to thank Vern Adams 
first because Vern Adams was the reason I was

17:38.243 --> 17:46.034
there. If Vern Adams had not wanted me there I would 
not have been there and it's the same way for the guy

17:48.944 --> 17:57.672
they have out here now if I had not wanted him there 
and not brought him there he would not be here Burn

17:58.090 --> 18:01.934
Adams is the reason that I was able to come to A&M. 
And then John Coldis was very helpful to me when he

18:02.735 --> 18:11.385
first came and I first came. And he was very nice

18:12.125 --> 18:18.553
to me and helped me a great deal. And of course, all 
of the Aggie Band Association and those people,

18:19.333 --> 18:28.063
the former students, There were a lot of people 
that I was in the band went down here that are former

18:31.537 --> 18:59.333
students that still worked a lot with Aggie Band 
Association and that thing was kind of touch and go

18:31.537 --> 18:59.333
sometime because we didn't have the four or five 
that were doing everything and a guy named George

18:31.537 --> 18:59.333
Humble who I was in the band with was president for 
four years and he got the scholarships going and I

18:31.537 --> 18:59.333
mean the scholarships he got the foundation 
things going and established one in Colonel Duns

18:59.313 --> 19:10.082
and Colonel Adams and in my name which and he 
started to raise the dues and establish some money

18:59.313 --> 19:10.082
and now they're they're they're working on the the 
core foundation, I think, and they're putting all

19:10.568 --> 19:16.336
their money into that and getting more interest, I 
think, out of it. I don't know how that's working.

19:17.899 --> 19:39.850
But, you know, there's so many people that just day 
by day were so good to you, and certainly you want to

19:17.899 --> 19:39.850
say something about the coaches and the athletic 
department because primarily you're striving

19:17.899 --> 19:39.850
for them more than anyone because they're the ones 
that are or making all of this possible. If it were

19:42.550 --> 19:48.692
not for them, no football games, you couldn't have 
a 300-piece Aggie band to play for six reviews, you

19:48.824 --> 19:57.192
know, that's something that you do extra. And so I 
just feel like that all the coaches they've had,

19:57.212 --> 20:11.647
Coach Pillar and Coach Slocum and Coach Sherrill 
and Wally Groff and all those guys, they just were

19:57.212 --> 20:11.647
great to us. And I just, General Simpson was very 
helpful in many respects. When you first got here,

20:17.107 --> 20:20.211
Dr. Williams was here? Dr. Williams was here, yes. 
And he was very nice to me, always. And then

20:25.737 --> 20:30.342
I'm just trying to think. Howard Perry was my boss 
for a while. He was a lot of help to me. And mainly,

20:38.031 --> 20:43.637
the guys in the band were the ones that golly knows 
if I had had a deal going with them it was not

20:44.680 --> 20:49.829
pleasant. It would have been impossible to do all 
these things we had to do. The last year I was there I

20:54.297 --> 20:59.165
had 45 performances I was responsible for. And 
that's not quite as many as the singing cadets

20:59.205 --> 21:02.511
either. Now you're talking about some people that 
go, singing cadets do. But you know without their

21:06.418 --> 21:08.882
cooperation And they call over there sometime on 
Wednesday. Well, you've got to have them there.

21:12.931 --> 21:14.692
You've got to have them so-and-so by Saturday. But 
that's their weekend off. Well, that's tough.

21:17.435 --> 21:18.075
They've got to go. And you call the COO and you say, 
look, I'm sorry, but that's what they say. Sir,

21:22.539 --> 21:23.340
they'll be there. All right, let's see. 
Hypothetical question. Let's make believe that

21:27.964 --> 21:33.108
you had an unlimited budget and unlimited staff. 
How large would you think the A&M band ought to be in

21:34.749 --> 21:38.953
numbers? If we had $10 million a year, I would be 
very selective and not march more than 303 people.

21:49.328 --> 21:59.341
So you think that's... That is ideal with the 
company fronts and the manner in which you go into

21:49.328 --> 21:59.341
your block and the manner and the things. It's 
large, but it does not limit your activities. With

22:04.768 --> 22:08.232
400 or 380 or whatever it is, you can't do much. and 
and I had some so what we call a step one drill it

22:09.427 --> 22:24.567
takes three minutes to pick them up some way but 
this step one drill where they're turning every

22:09.427 --> 22:24.567
step you can pick them up the whole bunch in 24 steps 
and they save not only time and everything but you

22:25.188 --> 22:46.909
can still do anything you need to do with 303 and 
that's that's what I would have and uh we've had had

22:25.188 --> 22:46.909
them smaller we've never tried one any larger but 
we've had them smaller 288 isn't bad that's what

22:25.188 --> 22:46.909
they marched that a couple times the first year I 
was here but then we lost a lot of them and uh uh

22:48.020 --> 23:11.243
that's what i would do that's perfect for me okay 
next last question let's make believe somebody

22:48.020 --> 23:11.243
gave you a million dollar check and there's only 
one restriction on the check you got to pass it on to

22:48.020 --> 23:11.243
texas a m but you can decide what it would be used to 
support what would you make that check uh I would be

23:12.792 --> 23:18.620
sure that we had first class horns to play all the 
time, and the music. And we pretty well traveled

23:18.860 --> 23:30.417
okay, and I would put it in a trust and use it when we 
needed it, but I would not have to. We had some horns

23:31.158 --> 23:34.582
that were so bad when I came here they wouldn't even 
play. Had old E flat horns, E flat basses and stuff

23:35.263 --> 23:39.169
like that. And John Colas helped me get some 
things. But I had to go out and raise $25,000 myself

23:42.948 --> 23:50.566
one year to get bases, because they didn't have any 
money. How much does a base horn cost around here?

23:53.573 --> 23:55.658
Now it costs about $5,000 or $6,000. Per horn? Per 
horn. It was about $3,000 then, $250. But it's

24:02.168 --> 24:05.053
just, well, gosh, it's hardly gone up so there. Of 
course, it's about $900 now. Can you imagine? All

24:08.880 --> 24:19.999
right, the last question then, as you look back on 
it, what has it meant to you and your life that you

24:08.880 --> 24:19.999
had to have this long association with Texas A&E? 
Well, first of all, I did not make the Aggie band. If

24:24.609 --> 24:28.835
I have had any success and recognition, it's 
because of what they did for me. Now, I think that I

24:30.016 --> 24:43.956
gave them some really nice things to do, but it has 
just meant so much to me to be associated with that

24:30.016 --> 24:43.956
bunch of dedicated people. That was what made it so 
much fun, is because they were not only

24:44.798 --> 24:52.088
intelligent now, they were not only fine players, 
But they had a wonderful attitude. They were

24:55.765 --> 24:59.129
dedicated and that marvelous talent. And they're 
just undying spirit. There's just not another

25:01.793 --> 25:04.676
group in the world like that bunch. And I think 
that's what got us through thick and thin. And

25:08.081 --> 25:16.532
sometimes you get so busy and you're so worried 
about this and worried about that that you forget

25:08.081 --> 25:16.532
what in the world they're doing. And I think the 
people at the university forget that. They think

25:20.577 --> 25:22.159
they're on the payroll. And I always tried to take 
up for them and fight for them. And a lot of people

25:26.983 --> 25:29.689
probably thought I was disagreeable. But if I 
didn't do it, who was going to do it? You cannot make

25:33.598 --> 25:36.285
those guys, and it hurts their grades. You can't 
tell me it doesn't hurt their grades. It does. They

25:38.879 --> 25:46.349
need to have time to study, and they need to have 
time to do the things that they want to do and have

25:38.879 --> 25:46.349
some time off. And that's what I tried to do. 
Sometimes it worked, and most of the time it

25:50.275 --> 25:53.700
didn't. But that's all right, too. I don't care. I 
don't ever remember going somewhere with that

25:56.644 --> 26:03.614
bunch, and they didn't try to do their best. And I 
don't remember many times that they didn't do

26:04.675 --> 26:07.519
their best. Now you're going to have some problems 
because nothing a thousand miles away is like it is

26:07.870 --> 26:36.207
over the phone and you had some some it seemed like 
the stadiums in the last two years they were not on

26:07.870 --> 26:36.207
top of everything and they'd say well you get there 
so and so and this will be so and so and it was never

26:07.870 --> 26:36.207
there you had to go look it up and it was just a big 
hassle but that bunch I I'm not sure they're

26:07.870 --> 26:36.207
they're not uh they they were very disciplined 
then And I didn't instill them. No, I told them if

26:38.187 --> 26:42.644
we're going to leave at 6 a.m., we left at 6 a.m. I 
said, sir, but there's eight seniors sacked out.

26:45.013 --> 26:47.462
And I said, well, if they don't get there, we're 
going to have eight holes. we went to Texas Tech and

26:48.168 --> 26:55.438
left eight of them one time and they were there 
waiting on us when we got there. We didn't see them

26:55.458 --> 26:58.322
go by those buses either. And also the next time 
they didn't oversleep. Well and I've had I've had

27:01.046 --> 27:11.801
the uh the bus man tell me said man you know 
sometimes now we stick around 30-40 minutes

27:01.046 --> 27:11.801
waiting on somebody to come. I said man we don't 
wait on anybody they're not there then and getting

27:14.965 --> 27:39.049
up and leaving at 1 30 in the morning so you could 
have a 12 o'clock or one two hour game and then uh in

27:14.965 --> 27:39.049
the afternoon with tech or arkansas or lsu or 
something it's a hard deal but they made it easy

27:14.965 --> 27:39.049
that's the only way i survived this teaching 
business that long well let me thank you so much for

27:14.965 --> 27:39.049
this and i'll turn this machine off
