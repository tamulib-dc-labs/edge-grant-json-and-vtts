WEBVTT

00:01.752 --> 00:06.017
enough light that you could read the lettering on 
my white phosphorus rockets. I don't know if you

00:06.397 --> 00:12.505
know about white phosphorus, but it burns 
without, I mean, you can put it in water. It can even

00:12.525 --> 00:15.148
burn to taste the oxygen in the water. They're used 
for marking rounds. You weren't supposed to

00:16.569 --> 00:19.333
engage the enemy with it. And you could also see my 
fuel vent dripping fuel right by this burning

00:19.353 --> 00:26.802
canister. And so I told the Air Force Stinger 
gunship, that I picked up one of his flares on my

00:29.140 --> 00:32.183
wing and I was going to go back to the LZ. And it was 
about a 15 minute flight back to the LZ. So I turned

00:36.006 --> 00:38.028
left. I could only do left hand turns. Turn left, 
head back to the LZ, and called and told him to get

00:39.610 --> 00:44.434
out the crash truck. And all this time I'd 
forgotten about the Vietnamese in the backseat.

00:48.678 --> 00:50.420
He was the littlest one we had, little tiny guy. And 
I looked over my shoulder to see how he was doing,

00:51.661 --> 00:55.705
and I said, pretty exciting, huh? This guy had not 
undone the metal clamp holding the fire

00:56.495 --> 01:01.282
extinguisher. He had ripped it out. Found out 
later he had actually ripped this metal clamp out.

01:05.689 --> 01:12.699
Had this little baby fire extinguisher, and he was 
holding it as if he could spray out the window of

01:05.689 --> 01:12.699
this fire, which he couldn't. And you've heard the 
expression, people shaking like a leaf. This

01:17.306 --> 01:21.652
man's entire body was violently shaking. I've 
never seen anybody more scared in my life. So I

01:24.336 --> 01:25.658
figured he wasn't going to be much help. And I went 
back to the LZ, and the LZ, the landing strip, is

01:26.887 --> 01:31.292
built up on the edge of a 200-foot cliff. And as I was 
heading on final into the wind, I started to lose

01:33.074 --> 01:41.484
altitude, and I had full power in. And I'm losing 
altitude, and my rate of descent is taking me into

01:42.986 --> 01:46.710
the face of the cliff. And that's, of course, not 
acceptable. So I thought I would, if I had to, I

01:50.935 --> 01:55.240
would turn off to the left into the ocean. Because 
if I turn to the right, I'm hitting another cliff.

02:00.015 --> 02:17.076
Which meant I had to land at night, going away from 
shore, on the water's surface, with no flotation

02:00.015 --> 02:17.076
equipment, wearing steel-soled and towed combat 
boots, a pistol, a canteen, a survival vest, two

02:00.015 --> 02:17.076
bandoliers of ammunition. Not only do I not have 
any flotation gear, but I'm responsible for the

02:17.427 --> 02:21.271
guy in the back seat. So I thought I would do that as a 
last resort. I'd see if I could clear the edge of the

02:24.195 --> 02:26.297
cliff. And for some reason, and I don't know how, I 
got a little bit of a boost at the end, and I just

02:26.317 --> 02:42.156
barely cleared some tangle foot barbed wire at the 
edge of the cliff, and a bunker, and a road, and I

02:26.317 --> 02:42.156
landed on the overrun of the runway. And so the next 
day, my crew chiefs gave me a party. I got a plaque at

02:45.794 --> 02:51.062
home that had a little piece of the player sheet on 
it that they gave me. I bet that guy didn't fly with

02:51.082 --> 02:54.067
you anymore. Oh, yeah. But he was scared. We had 
another guy take a few rounds one day, and he took

02:55.209 --> 03:10.713
one round that shattered a pulley for his rudder 
controls and went through the rudder, the metal

02:55.209 --> 03:10.713
rudder itself, and lodged it in his boot. It didn't 
hit him, but it stuck in his boot. And the next day,

03:14.296 --> 03:16.519
he was due to go out on a mission. We had so many 
missions we needed to get additional pilots in, so

03:17.501 --> 03:24.772
he'd come from another platoon. And he was late 
getting out of the aircraft, and we went into the

03:24.792 --> 03:29.439
hangar to find him. He was in the alert shack, lying 
on a cot, turning blue, having a convulsion. He was

03:35.128 --> 03:35.809
so scared. And so he was relieved we sent him back. 
And I can understand, you know. Bobby Beale flew

03:42.292 --> 03:48.200
the next day after he got shot down. Bobby Beale was 
the guy that crashed and played in the bicycle with

03:48.220 --> 03:53.247
me and almost had the mid-air in the bicycle. And 
then our last day in process, or out processing, we

03:53.267 --> 03:58.374
were flying from Quignon back to Camron. We 
stopped at the train for lunch. Again, he's flying

04:01.399 --> 04:07.127
in the front seat and I'm sitting in the back and he 
almost hit a C-130. Bobby almost killed me three

04:07.147 --> 04:10.351
times. But he's a big guy. Do you feel that the 
communication was effective enough and also

04:13.342 --> 04:28.239
honest from the United States government to 
everyone in Vietnam? Do you feel that they were

04:28.259 --> 04:32.324
hiding some information from you? Oh, I think they 
were. I think Johnson did, and I think Nixon did. I

04:37.229 --> 04:42.235
flew for, I can't remember how long, two, three 
weeks. where I couldn't fire, even have fired upon

04:43.649 --> 04:49.355
without calling for clearance. And clearance 
came through Vietnamese sources.

04:54.159 --> 04:55.821
And nobody ever told us why. It was a stupid rule. It 
was stupid. If you're getting shot at and you can't

04:57.943 --> 05:02.787
shoot back, we shot back. You know, we called for 
clearance, but we'd go ahead and shoot. If they

05:06.051 --> 05:08.233
came back and said, you have clearance, we'd say, 
thank you. If they came back and said, you don't

05:09.134 --> 05:11.756
have clearance, we'd say, thank you. We'd already 
fired anyway. One incident which made me hate the

05:13.552 --> 05:30.390
Vietnamese all the more, when I worked with the 
first of the 50th Mechanized, I'd do what is called

05:13.552 --> 05:30.390
recon by fire, and they were going to sweep an area, 
and they're in tanks, I mean, you're not going to

05:13.552 --> 05:30.390
surprise anybody. What we wanted to do was break up 
ambushes and mines. So I'd fire artillery into the

05:33.573 --> 05:41.382
bush ahead of them and set off secondary 
explosions where the mines were. Shut off the...

05:46.238 --> 05:50.862
Anyway, they were sweeping an area that had not 
been swept in a long time. It was surrounded by open

05:50.902 --> 06:01.251
country, but it was a couple mile long, mile wide, 
real thick area. And somebody decided they needed

06:01.832 --> 06:03.573
to sweep it. So I called for the usual clearance to 
recon by fire with artillery ahead of them. And the

06:13.181 --> 06:14.963
request was denied. from sector, and sector was 
the Vietnamese control of the province. I thought

06:22.021 --> 06:26.507
that was sort of unusual, but they normally ask for 
me when they do these sweeps. So I flew over them for

06:27.829 --> 06:29.351
four hours. Four hours was the limit of my fuel.

06:34.318 --> 06:39.365
And this area was so thick that they had to dismount 
from the tanks and go by foot. So I was relieved on

06:41.608 --> 06:44.933
station by another aircraft and went back to 
refuel And while I was on the ground refueling, the

06:45.149 --> 06:49.754
word came that they'd been hit by a bunch of mines. 
They started walking into mines, and they had

06:49.794 --> 06:54.479
about 20 guys injured from mines. I don't think 
anybody died, but they were torn up pretty bad. So

06:59.505 --> 07:09.216
they sent helicopters out to pick up the wounded 
and brought them back, and the little clinic was

06:59.505 --> 07:09.216
right behind my hangar. and they unloaded the 
dust-offs right there outside of my hangar. I had

07:15.008 --> 07:16.370
to help carry the wounded in. And I'm convinced 
that somebody at sector knew that place was mine,

07:19.073 --> 07:25.581
and that's why I didn't get clearance to fire. 
Also, have you seen the original movie, M.A.S.H.?

07:31.008 --> 07:31.709
Not the movie, no. Okay, well, whoever did the 
makeup for the casualties in that movie has been

07:31.989 --> 07:37.937
there. Because these guys are dirty and they're 
burned. And

07:43.573 --> 07:58.688
once you see somebody that's been hit by a mine or 
stepped on a mine, you

07:43.573 --> 07:58.688
don't forget it. What do you think or what was one of 
the biggest mistakes you think we made? We made

08:05.014 --> 08:08.717
giving them sanctuary. imposing artificial 
rules. When we first started bombing the North,

08:10.945 --> 08:23.420
the Joint Chiefs gave Johnson a list of 500 targets 
that they said should be hit within the first two

08:10.945 --> 08:23.420
weeks, no later than the first six weeks. Johnson 
and his policy of gradual escalation, some of

08:23.460 --> 08:28.606
those targets never got hit. Most of them didn't 
get hit for years. He picked targets that were

08:33.371 --> 08:36.455
ineffectual, that had no military significance. 
They blew up bushes again. We could, in other

08:39.612 --> 08:50.187
words, at the time we flew in the north, not me, but 
U.S. pilots, they could not shoot the enemy planes

08:39.612 --> 08:50.187
on the ground. They had to be in the air before we 
could shoot them down or blow up the planes. Now, is

08:54.734 --> 08:56.156
that stupid or what? You know, we couldn't put 
ground troops in the north. Here you're fighting

09:01.364 --> 09:06.531
an enemy that's got ground troops in your area that 
you can't go into theirs, excuse me. Just

09:07.118 --> 09:12.045
absolutely inane, insane, idiotic policies. And 
we could have done a much better job. Who was

09:18.054 --> 09:20.237
primarily responsible? Was that Johnson saying? 
Johnson refused to even have audience with

09:22.581 --> 09:29.571
Wheeler and other people from the Joint Chiefs of 
Staff. He totally ignored their advice. Totally

09:32.435 --> 09:33.717
ignored their advice. Was that because he didn't 
really want to call it a war to the United States? I

09:40.234 --> 09:41.115
don't know why it was. I'm not inside the man's 
mind. Rumor control has it that through hidden

09:45.161 --> 09:56.658
assets, he had holdings in Bell Helicopter and 
Sealand Transportation. And Sealand

09:56.758 --> 10:02.286
Transportation may not mean anything to you, but 
if you saw the container ships coming in,

09:56.758 --> 10:02.286
Sealand... made a ton of money on this war. So if in 
fact, and this is only speculation, but if in fact

10:06.448 --> 10:22.947
he had financial interest in these companies and 
was therefore prolonging the war,

10:06.448 --> 10:22.947
well, if you believe what goes around comes 
around, he's getting what comes around now. What

10:25.010 --> 10:31.137
did you think that the Kennedy administration did 
as far as engaging us in it? Well, they were

10:31.157 --> 10:32.779
idealistic. They were not real practical. 
Eisenhower tried to keep us out of Vietnam. He

10:41.124 --> 10:46.530
advised us against going into Vietnam and refused 
to get us involved when he was in office. Kennedy,

10:47.391 --> 10:53.177
feeling that we could take on the world, got us 
involved with advisors, started the buildup.

10:53.637 --> 10:54.919
Johnson completed the buildup. Johnson thought 
he could have a war to boost the economy. and have a

10:59.438 --> 11:01.400
war on poverty at the same time. And he was 
mistaken. He was mistaken in many things that he

11:04.204 --> 11:05.966
did. His history also shows, in my opinion, that he 
was not what you call an honest politician, and

11:07.087 --> 11:18.440
therefore I put nothing past the man.

11:19.442 --> 11:26.610
If you read the book Thud Ridge, it talks about the 
flights in the north to real Iowa.

11:29.071 --> 11:31.674
But I fault Johnson for a lot of this. Like I said, by 
the time Nixon got there, all he could do was try and

11:31.694 --> 11:35.498
get us out the best way possible. Communists 
understand power.

11:41.865 --> 11:42.405
Who was it? Was it Lenin or Ho Chi Minh? I think it was 
Lenin who said, political power comes from the

11:45.829 --> 11:50.554
barrel of a gun. They understand power. Whenever 
we bombed the North, they came to the negotiating

11:52.596 --> 11:56.360
table. When we stopped, They'd stop. It was the 
bombing that got them to sign that stupid truce

12:00.583 --> 12:05.108
that they signed. False though it was. When 
Eisenhower took office from Truman, the war in

12:09.473 --> 12:17.182
Korea had been going on for a while and they'd been 
negotiating and fighting back and forth. My

12:18.283 --> 12:21.627
father was on a ship offshore Korea. It was a 
communications center for communications to our

12:22.308 --> 12:28.575
negotiators at Panmunjom. Eisenhower had been in 
office a very short time, and he sent a message

12:29.804 --> 12:44.141
through that communications center that my 
father saw 200 negotiators saying, tell these

12:29.804 --> 12:44.141
people that unless they sign a peace, that we'll 
have a war like World War II. And they signed it like

12:44.862 --> 12:46.123
that. Now, that's what they understand, and we 
could have kicked them from here to China had we

12:47.445 --> 12:56.436
been allowed to. And even when we didn't give The 
sanctuary in North Vietnam, we gave them

12:58.778 --> 13:01.364
sanctuary in China. They fly their planes. The 
North Koreans flew their planes into China. The

13:07.477 --> 13:12.448
Vietnamese flew theirs into China to protect 
them, just like the Iraqis flew theirs into Iran.

13:13.350 --> 13:15.555
We always give our enemies sanctuary somewhere. 
So this war was, I don't know if this is correct, it

13:16.632 --> 13:23.619
was different in a sense that our administration 
was wishy-washy. Very much so. Would not say go in

13:25.161 --> 13:27.043
and just get the enemy. What sanctuaries did we 
give the Axis powers in World War II? None. We

13:32.149 --> 13:36.834
started giving sanctuary in Korea because we were 
afraid of widening the war. The popular saying is

13:37.835 --> 13:40.558
you can't win a land war in Asia. Well, we don't 
fight land wars anymore. We fight combined arms

13:43.601 --> 13:45.463
wars. Right. And we

13:46.383 --> 13:54.730
did them so much damage, and we lost Ted for 68 in the 
press. We won it militarily, and that's a fact. And

13:58.133 --> 14:01.496
I challenge anyone to dispute that. But yeah, we 
could have won that battle. It was just stupidly,

14:04.739 --> 14:05.459
stupidly fine. And that's the one thing, you know, 
would I want my sons to fight in a wasteful war like

14:05.479 --> 14:12.565
that? Well, no, I wouldn't. Would I advise them to 
go if if they're called upon. Yes, I would.

14:23.736 --> 14:29.242
There are times that you stand on principle.

14:31.804 --> 14:39.132
The people who went to Canada, I don't believe 
stood on principle. They could have done

14:39.152 --> 14:43.997
alternative service.

14:44.264 --> 14:45.847
I think they were basically cowards. I heard 
people say, you know, I'm not going to go to Vietnam

14:45.927 --> 14:50.354
and get killed. Well, first of all, not everybody 
went to Vietnam. Second of all, very relatively

14:52.898 --> 14:56.765
few who went to Vietnam got killed. That was a 
10-year war. We had 50,000 killed in 10 years.

15:01.172 --> 15:02.535
That's 50,000 too many. One is too many. I believe 
that. I also realize that we kill 50,000 a year on

15:07.202 --> 15:10.508
the highways. So we've got to put it in 
perspective. There were times when we were losing

15:14.623 --> 15:18.108
a lot. The Life Magazine story, have you seen that? 
Look in the library for the Life Magazine issue

15:21.633 --> 15:28.282
that takes a week's casualties. People killed in a 
specific week. They put in their name and their

15:32.908 --> 15:35.252
picture. Now that'll get you. That'll get you. And 
yeah, it was a waste, but And

15:40.036 --> 15:47.724
I think the thing to do is to fight. Communism is not 
dead. One of the people that's supporting Mandela

15:50.707 --> 15:55.031
in South Africa is a communist. Some of the people 
trying to take over in Russia are communists.

15:58.574 --> 15:59.876
Communism is not dead. It is evil. Everybody jokes 
at Reagan for calling it the evil empire. It is the

16:04.981 --> 16:06.162
evil empire. They lie, cheat, steal, and kill as a 
matter of policy. Our government has screwed up,

16:12.675 --> 16:19.669
but theirs does it all the time as a matter of 
policy. And we have got to continue to fight that.

16:24.800 --> 16:27.846
So the idea then, you think... was absolutely 
justified. It's just the means, the way the war was

16:30.678 --> 16:32.640
fought. The way it was fought. See, Kennedy got a 
little involved, too, in the politics. He got

16:37.666 --> 16:45.754
involved in changing the people in power in 
Vietnam.

16:45.975 --> 16:54.704
The domino theory was, in fact, a valid theory, 
whether it worked out in practice or not. There are

16:54.724 --> 16:58.508
some people who tell you that it did or it didn't. 
Definitely, had we not fought them as much as we

16:59.770 --> 17:05.436
did, I think it probably would have. But

17:07.338 --> 17:15.226
I don't think we prosecuted the war with the South 
Vietnamese properly.

17:18.710 --> 17:21.833
I'm not really qualified to speak on that. I think 
we could have done better, but I don't know. Had I

17:23.896 --> 17:28.140
been in the position of power, exactly what I would 
have had to do differently. Anything else? No.
