WEBVTT

00:02.849 --> 00:04.131
Once about Prairie View. Prairie View. I said, I 
think I made the appointment because I wanted to

00:05.113 --> 00:10.942
talk with him. I was quite prepared to do what we 
could to help political science at Prairie View.

00:18.734 --> 00:31.253
And I told Dr. Williams at the moment, the 
Department of Political Science at Prairie View

00:18.734 --> 00:31.253
is headed by a man with a master's degree in 
education.

00:33.528 --> 00:38.716
who is scared of President Thomas. They will not, 
Thomas will not allow their students to come to us

00:41.019 --> 00:50.152
for an MPA. One of their assistants in the 
admissions office wanted to come. I'm sure Thomas

00:54.859 --> 00:56.702
said no. I had a faculty member, a woman, who'd been 
on the faculty A&M. I can't give you her name

01:03.964 --> 01:05.766
offhand. Black woman. In terms of affirmative 
action, you can't be more affirmative. And she was

01:14.276 --> 01:15.097
good. She now has a PhD and is teaching, I think, in 
Louisiana Southern, maybe. And

01:22.086 --> 01:28.013
I said, what can be done about this? And I'll never 
forget William's part. What we really ought to do

01:31.493 --> 01:36.840
is close it up. Did you see the morning paper in the 
Houston op-ed? Yes. They're a law and medical

01:39.564 --> 01:43.089
school. Because I thought, in terms of 
management, neither Texas Southern or Prairie

01:43.109 --> 01:52.762
View have a very good record. The more recent 
generals have been somewhat of an improvement.

02:00.063 --> 02:18.222
Let's see, Dr. Williams and Dr. Calhoun

02:00.063 --> 02:18.222
move out from university-level administration 
in the mid-'70s, six and seven, and Jarvis Miller

02:00.063 --> 02:18.222
and Mac Prescott take over. Did that change 
anything for you as a department head? Not a lot.

02:22.807 --> 02:27.572
Prescott was very helpful because it was under him 
the MPA went through. and he was a guiding piece and

02:28.244 --> 02:32.148
so on.

02:34.851 --> 02:45.722
Environmental design wanted in on it, several 
people wanted to cut in on it by that point and he

02:34.851 --> 02:45.722
held the line and we went with the design that it had 
been. Jarvis Miller I had no connection with

02:48.285 --> 02:56.614
except we all remember when he said everybody will 
be in their offices from eight to five.

02:59.952 --> 03:02.455
and what he thought was going on. He apparently had 
seen some people jogging at odd hours, and there

03:02.495 --> 03:10.222
was interesting reactions to that. But

03:10.523 --> 03:15.568
no, no special problem. The school was growing so 
rapidly and all the rest, we were hitting the

03:16.148 --> 03:21.774
problem of large classes. And how did you all face 
that? with large classes. But taught by? I

03:28.973 --> 03:31.837
insisted. Oh, one thing my predecessor had done 
was to do 206

03:32.057 --> 03:46.480
and 7 by lectures and assistant professors, upper 
division by associate professors, and graduate

03:32.057 --> 03:46.480
work by full professors. I said, I'm sorry, this is 
coming to a screeching halt. And everybody will at

03:50.698 --> 03:55.863
least have one section of 206 and 7. And I took an 
honors course in 206 myself as my one teaching job

03:56.544 --> 04:06.295
for the moment, my way of illustration. But all 
sections were taught by faculty. Yes. I'll say

04:13.257 --> 04:26.195
with a few exceptions, I did give some graduate 
assistants a section after they'd been here as

04:13.257 --> 04:26.195
graduate students at least one year. Can you share 
any goofy, loony, only at A&M-like events that you

04:27.757 --> 04:37.510
coped with as a department head?

04:40.190 --> 04:58.700
Well, I was told that if I hadn't been coming, that 
the departmental graduate students, of whom

04:40.190 --> 04:58.700
there were three or four on the highly liberal 
side, would have hung rubber rudder in effigy that

04:40.190 --> 04:58.700
spring, which would have been an interesting 
problem to inherit.

05:02.366 --> 05:05.151
No, I don't know anything startling. Any jokes 
that got played on any faculty member by the

05:05.502 --> 05:11.689
students or anything like that? Not that I can 
think of. We did have one faculty member harassing

05:15.253 --> 05:24.543
the lady graduate students who finally left.

05:24.603 --> 05:34.935
Did you ever have any midnight calls by anybody 
about anything supposedly happening in the

05:24.603 --> 05:34.935
department?

05:35.455 --> 05:38.419
One funny one involves Linda.

05:41.923 --> 06:02.087
I get a call that

05:41.923 --> 06:02.087
Linda would like to come talk to me, and she is the 
wife of Ralph Hambrick, who is an assistant

05:41.923 --> 06:02.087
professor, very good.

06:06.050 --> 06:13.982
We

06:06.050 --> 06:13.982
weren't sure at first. No, I'm sorry. Hamrick's

06:16.046 --> 06:21.394
wife is not named Linda. Hamrick's wife is 
calling, sir, like Mary or something. She wants to

06:25.841 --> 06:27.343
talk to him. Well, we're over across the road over 
there, and she comes to our house to talk. She said,

06:35.075 --> 06:36.737
Oh, dear, I've got problems. My husband is going 
with somebody else. And if it

06:43.785 --> 06:53.115
just weren't for Linda, I thought, oh, God, Linda 
is Gary Holder's wife. For God's sake, where are we

06:53.235 --> 06:55.297
into it? Well, it turned out Linda is also the name 
of one of our secretaries. So I kept a straight face

07:00.043 --> 07:03.006
to find out what, Linda, are we talking about?

07:09.626 --> 07:12.109
It turned out that it was the... The secretary. Our 
departmental secretary.

07:20.180 --> 07:26.347
And eventually, Ralph and his wife divorce, and he 
marries Linda. And Ralph is now at the University

07:27.008 --> 07:32.976
of Richmond, and full professor, and Linda is his 
wife. But it was a little uncertain for a bit whose

07:33.918 --> 07:39.745
wife. Did anyone ever, from outside the 
appropriate scope of the department, did anyone

07:40.266 --> 07:49.818
try to ever intervene to meddle? An A&M former 
student, a board member, a politician? Anybody

07:57.107 --> 08:00.271
try to influence an admission or a grade? No more. 
You're talking about the senator? Yeah, Bull of

08:03.773 --> 08:08.039
the Brassets.

08:09.662 --> 08:28.849
Well, I got word from the dean that

08:09.662 --> 08:28.849
one

08:09.662 --> 08:28.849
of my lectures,

08:09.662 --> 08:28.849
Dan

08:09.662 --> 08:28.849
is now with the

08:32.963 --> 08:44.738
controller's office in Florida, I think, Dan 
Burns, had made comments about political

08:32.963 --> 08:44.738
corruption in Texas. And

08:46.019 --> 09:01.198
Moore had made the cover of Time at one time in 
connection with the scandals prior to Ben Barnes

08:46.019 --> 09:01.198
and the rest of it. and that Moore was after Dan 
Burns. Well, I went to Benton, and I said, what?

09:13.121 --> 09:16.946
Well, Benton said, we've got a clipping file over 
in the library. And he got me all the clippings

09:18.047 --> 09:29.802
about Moore's insurance scandal activities, 
into which he was up to his ass in problems. and made

09:30.811 --> 09:33.594
a Xerox of them for me. And I sent that file about 
Moore to Maxwell. And I never heard another word.

09:40.362 --> 09:45.989
Now, what went on, I don't know.

09:46.449 --> 09:52.436
Did you ever get a complaint from a parent or anyone 
about us? Yes, on Elias Thermos for teaching

09:52.676 --> 09:58.303
revolution.

09:59.785 --> 10:06.551
Because on his reading list is Das Kapital and 
several other books. They're not required

10:06.791 --> 10:10.375
reading, but on the reading list. And I called 
Elias and I said, what gives? He said, well, we

10:14.739 --> 10:20.144
discussed revolution, of course, and the 
political theory. I said, OK. Don't worry, Elias.

10:23.366 --> 10:24.888
I think I can take care of this. And I

10:24.988 --> 10:29.472
said, We have a policy in political science, 
particularly in light of our situation in A&M and

10:30.802 --> 10:48.848
the military, that we have a policy that it is 
absolutely essential that you know your enemy.

10:48.868 --> 10:49.710
I never heard any more.

10:52.714 --> 10:54.216
Did anyone ever try to... Excuse me. Don't 
forget... OK, I was about to ask, did anyone ever

10:57.683 --> 11:13.908
try to, from outside the appropriate scope of the 
department, ever try to influence a grade that

10:57.683 --> 11:13.908
someone received or might receive?

11:20.619 --> 11:21.480
Not really. I never had any particular pressure. I 
handled

11:26.422 --> 11:43.805
a great appeal once, which caused me to give some 
thought to the A&M judicial system. I was acting

11:45.106 --> 11:56.361
head one Christmas vacation for Kirkpatrick. And 
a

11:57.067 --> 12:17.590
great appeal came in from

11:57.067 --> 12:17.590
a student and his parents because if it stood, he 
wasn't going to graduate.

12:19.032 --> 12:25.960
And complaints on George Edwards.

12:26.733 --> 12:42.330
who is an assistant professor, I think at the time, 
maybe associate,

12:26.733 --> 12:42.330
and

12:26.733 --> 12:42.330
on the examination grade. I

12:43.752 --> 12:51.300
discussed it with them and they accepted. I said, I 
will have that paper read by And we discussed who,

12:59.116 --> 13:02.521
and I said, what about Professor Benton? Yes, he 
said, that would be appropriate. So I had

13:04.684 --> 13:08.009
Professor Benton read the paper. And Benton

13:09.471 --> 13:25.174
gave it a D. Now, I said, that is so close to the grade 
that you got, I will not change the grade. He

13:25.930 --> 13:33.038
appealed to the judicial committee, and the 
judicial committee overturned the thing without

13:25.930 --> 13:33.038
consideration. And the student judicial 
committee, and there's some faculty on it too, did

13:33.318 --> 13:41.667
not support the faculty. And I figured there are 
two problems with it. One is there's no way for

13:44.430 --> 13:49.815
faculty to appeal that kind of thing. And second, 
there's no training in the student judicial body

13:50.596 --> 13:54.300
in proper evidential procedures.

14:01.243 --> 14:18.853
But correct me if I'm wrong, in your years I didn't 
hear you say that some legislator, some

14:01.243 --> 14:18.853
self-appointed important Aggie called you up to 
get so-and-so passed or get so-and-so admitted,

14:01.243 --> 14:18.853
no outside information. If you were looking back 
on those... Next to nothing. I can't think of

14:24.090 --> 14:26.174
anything on that. Looking back over those years in 
the department, which department members do you

14:26.535 --> 14:36.293
think deserve the greatest praise? I'm not going 
to ask you the negative. If you were giving pats on

14:38.357 --> 14:43.407
the back, who would get the most?

14:52.837 --> 14:55.439
I think, in many ways, Gary Holder. Why? Explain. I 
don't disagree with you. I'm just asking you to

14:59.583 --> 15:01.705
elaborate. He was a first-rate teacher. He did not 
publish much. He is now doing more. And he

15:07.911 --> 15:21.544
has handled the student

15:07.911 --> 15:21.544
advising function for years. drive most people to 
drink. I always advocated that this kind of

15:25.831 --> 15:36.765
service function, somebody has to do. And

15:36.805 --> 15:51.683
Warren Dixon was not publishing much, but he was 
doing the laboratory.

15:53.671 --> 15:54.692
developing that. And I said to the faculty, or to 
the dean, I said, I want to give tenure to both Dixon

15:55.012 --> 16:07.243
and Holder who they haven't published much for 
their service and their things. I said, a

16:07.264 --> 16:21.336
department's got to have a few people who are 
willing to do the sub-administrative work that is

16:07.264 --> 16:21.336
absolutely essential. And they were willing to 
pick up things. It was at some cost to them. I didn't

16:27.395 --> 16:36.830
care whether they were, some other people are 
going to write and so on, but they were both very

16:27.395 --> 16:36.830
good at what they did. Typist, this is an editorial 
note. When Gary Halter was a sophomore, he was in

16:42.039 --> 16:45.885
one of my classes, And it was my policy then, my wife 
and I would have each of my classes over to our house

16:46.304 --> 16:58.034
for a reception and to get acquainted near the end 
of the semester. And on this particular evening,

16:58.995 --> 17:14.028
this young sophomore transfer student from 
Wichita Falls, Gary Halter, stayed after

16:58.995 --> 17:14.028
everybody else left and told me he was thinking 
about dropping out of school, wasn't sure he was

16:58.995 --> 17:14.028
making much progress. Did I have any advice for 
him? We chatted a long time and I tried to persuade

17:16.696 --> 17:21.660
him that I thought he had many of the capabilities 
that a good faculty member needed. And I urged him,

17:27.159 --> 17:39.772
since he said he was short of money, go back home to 
Wichita Falls and take another year at Midwestern

17:27.159 --> 17:39.772
University that he had attended as a freshman. 
Since then, he has told me that that advice that

17:39.792 --> 17:48.181
evening was rather important to him, because at 
that point, he didn't know where else to turn. So

17:48.682 --> 17:51.445
let's add that as an editorial note here. Any other 
faculty? Yes, Arnold Bedlitz. I hired Arnold

17:55.894 --> 17:58.676
around 75. I had $9,000

17:58.876 --> 18:20.436
left in the budget, and I called down to Houston to 
see who they had, and Arnold was available, and I

17:58.876 --> 18:20.436
told Arnold, almost sight unseen, I said, I've got 
$9,000 if you want to come for that for the year.

18:22.525 --> 18:24.147
Why, you can have it. And he came. He's been here 
ever since. And I think done a superb job. And after

18:30.357 --> 18:37.407
three or four years, I could begin to close the 
salary gap that was there. Was it good that you, as

18:38.208 --> 18:46.580
the department head, had the authority to go out 
and do the looking? Was that better than having a

18:47.582 --> 18:50.406
big search committee? Well, I always had the 
authority and kept it for lectures or

18:50.437 --> 18:57.669
instructors. Assistant professors, we had 
committees.

19:03.037 --> 19:07.244
Let me do some quick things for teaching that I had 
to do. Outside of the department, were there any

19:09.748 --> 19:18.081
other department heads that were good allies for 
the department? Well, John Pearson, I mentioned

19:18.382 --> 19:22.951
in business, worked together very nicely. We 
worked together very well with Samson in,

19:23.893 --> 19:33.250
what engineering was he in? Chuck Samson? Chuck 
Samson. I see, civil? Civil engineering. Civil

19:37.919 --> 19:39.883
engineering had the first training program for 
city managers in the United States, as far as we

19:40.994 --> 19:45.281
know. And they were helpful in providing 
engineering for non-engineers and some special

19:45.982 --> 20:01.767
work in street engineering in cities, etc. And 
Samson and I functioned very well. The sociology

20:06.774 --> 20:16.588
and anthropology were in Bolton a bit, and we 
worked out the laboratory thing among us. Those

20:18.591 --> 20:25.500
have been... In hindsight, can you think of any 
missed opportunities for the department or the

20:25.761 --> 20:32.550
campus during those years?

20:36.766 --> 20:42.515
Looking back now...

20:36.766 --> 20:42.515
No, I don't think as much.

20:46.681 --> 20:52.169
Were there any proposals you sent forward 
relating to the department that got scuttled?

20:55.434 --> 20:59.280
No, the main one that was scuttled for a while was 
the MPA. But it's simply because of the

20:59.699 --> 21:02.562
coordinating board.

21:05.886 --> 21:07.869
Is there any advice? Let's make believe now you're 
anointed to be the advisor to the department, to

21:07.889 --> 21:15.798
the college, to the university. What advice would 
you give today to each of those levels?

21:24.128 --> 21:27.192
What should political science be aspiring to do 
today?

21:31.002 --> 21:39.350
Well, I'm in general sympathy with the 
department, except political science

21:31.002 --> 21:39.350
departments generally have got a problem. For as 
I'm concerned, the field of public law is going

21:39.390 --> 21:49.339
into decline, as there was a period when public 
administration was.

21:55.145 --> 21:57.567
The department does not have It has Judith Bair, 
who's superb. She'd just gotten a prize from ASPA,

22:02.119 --> 22:09.650
American Political Science Association, for a 
book on women and law. And we had originally Benton

22:10.932 --> 22:22.530
and Woods

22:10.932 --> 22:22.530
for de-emphasis in public law, which strikes me as 
idiocy. And we have nobody in international law.

22:28.748 --> 22:31.031
You kind of get that problem. And

22:31.392 --> 22:49.356
the behavioral number stuff is very heavy, but I 
don't have any great problem with that. So that

22:50.281 --> 22:58.111
would be the main criticism I would have of the 
department. What about at the university level?

22:59.913 --> 23:03.497
What advice would you give today's leadership, if 
any?

23:07.562 --> 23:12.608
Well, the Vision 2000 is interesting. I was just 
taking a look at it a while back because I'm working

23:12.628 --> 23:19.056
on a set of bylaws for the Bush School. As my wife 
tells friends occasionally, he does bylaws.

23:29.088 --> 23:30.609
I offered to play with it. I'm a parliamentarian 
for the Senate and so on. And I did the bylaws for the

23:34.694 --> 23:38.219
College of Liberal Arts. There has been a 
tendency, Maxwell was the last dean who really

23:46.711 --> 23:53.941
emphasized faculty participation in the entire 
operation of the college. We had a monthly faculty

23:53.961 --> 24:05.277
meeting which handled the business, the academic 
business of the college. The Department of Law

24:07.450 --> 24:13.479
proposal, it went through the entire faculty. The 
committee system backing it up and

24:13.579 --> 24:18.646
recommendations, et cetera.

24:20.849 --> 24:27.759
Your history man who succeeded, and I cannot think 
of his name, the man who now dean. Oh, came from

24:28.100 --> 24:30.263
Oklahoma. Yeah.

24:34.214 --> 24:36.360
And he's now at Telluride, Colorado. I think so. 
Then the fellow who came out of psychology, who's

24:37.864 --> 24:46.769
now at Maryland, the next dean. He was here for 
several years. Okay, I can't think of it either.

24:52.802 --> 25:01.392
But he was here, and he ended Maxwell's faculty for 
an elected small policy committee. And I think it

25:01.993 --> 25:05.537
shot communications through the college. And 
ever since Williams, I have not sensed any

25:07.118 --> 25:19.392
interest in the administration up above that 
there be really much faculty governance. Now this

25:26.675 --> 25:32.682
creation of the faculty senate by our historian. 
Frank Vandiver. Vandiver is an exception in that.

25:37.888 --> 25:44.215
And because it's got authority to, it can't. 
override the board or the president, but it's got

25:44.667 --> 25:50.577
authority to talk about any damn thing it wants to, 
really. It has almost any connection to the

25:50.597 --> 25:56.386
academic work. And we have not had regular faculty 
meetings. There's one faculty meeting a year, I

26:01.314 --> 26:11.350
think, in the college, which is a pro forma thing 
for making awards.

26:12.730 --> 26:15.536
And the Vision 2000 doesn't do much more. There's a 
sentence about governance, and there's a

26:18.262 --> 26:30.267
backhanded reference to faculty in the last 
sentence of that. Do you think that in the Vision

26:30.787 --> 26:45.905
2020, the goal of A&M moving up within the next 20 
years to be one of the top 10 public institutions in

26:30.787 --> 26:45.905
the country, do you think that is an appropriate 
goal? Is it reachable? It's reachable if anybody

26:47.847 --> 26:50.070
will put money to it. And I...

26:58.580 --> 27:00.102
It depends on the... Top echelon.

27:06.357 --> 27:11.372
And I view part of his, I view the president as very 
good. I view the next layers as highly

27:11.392 --> 27:16.487
questionable.

27:20.129 --> 27:23.733
I'm nodding in agreement with you on that. Let's 
move to the Bush Library. When did you become aware

27:26.896 --> 27:36.626
that there was going to be an effort by Texas A&M to 
attract the presidential library of George Bush?

27:36.646 --> 27:39.329
Oh, I wasn't terribly aware of it. Let's see, we 
began to get discussions of this

27:48.800 --> 27:55.267
Because very early, and I'm working on a history of 
the Bush School.

27:55.287 --> 28:09.281
And very early on, within six months of Hal Booty's 
visit to Bush in, what the hell is it, 80 or 81 or 79?

28:09.301 --> 28:11.143
Oh, when he's elected? Yeah. Oh, he's elected in 
88. He's elected.

28:16.828 --> 28:17.389
That's right. He's elected, excuse me, but he 
isn't in the office yet. That's right. He calls on

28:26.629 --> 28:28.791
him late in November 1988. Yeah, okay. Because 
within two or three months of that, the school is

28:31.294 --> 28:37.041
part of the deal. And having been involved with the 
MPA program, we're immediately... brought on it

28:43.880 --> 28:51.827
as to how does this fit.

28:51.847 --> 28:57.151
So I'm aware there are negotiations

28:51.847 --> 28:57.151
fairly early. It's

28:57.171 --> 29:01.975
a bit of a surprise. As Lewis Newman, who was on the 
committee, talked to Rotary not long after the

29:03.396 --> 29:13.785
decision was made, he said, He was present in 
Houston when Rice and Houston and we made

29:14.407 --> 29:22.698
presentations. And he said it was very odd Kathy 
Whitmer was making one for Houston, I think. But it

29:32.572 --> 29:43.587
was in general terms as if they both took it for 
granted it would be one of them, but did not have an

29:32.572 --> 29:43.587
awful lot in concrete where A&M had the land, had a 
school in mind, had the

29:44.478 --> 30:07.009
driveway named,

29:44.478 --> 30:07.009
and it was already on the drawing boards exactly 
where the hell it would be. Can you think of any

30:08.508 --> 30:12.734
misstep A&M made in that process? No. I don't know 
of any. Who are the people, as far as you know? The

30:17.041 --> 30:19.905
main one, I've heard him say this. He said, after 
all, Yale hugged me in effigy twice.

30:26.375 --> 30:28.218
And I've reported that to friends. Which A&M 
people deserve pats on the back most for the Bush

30:28.378 --> 30:35.950
Library being here? Al Booney and, oh, another 
board member who'd been, I can't remember. John

30:44.035 --> 30:44.716
Lindsay? Lindsay.

30:48.741 --> 30:51.545
And then the A&M administration handled it well, 
didn't they? Yes, the OX business dean who then got

30:51.825 --> 30:58.414
chatted to him. And Perry Atkinson was the 
chancellor. Perry Atkinson, chancellor of... At

31:06.625 --> 31:17.261
no point appearing

31:06.625 --> 31:17.261
to be either

31:06.625 --> 31:17.261
uninterested or obstructed. Now, were people in 
the real world of academia called upon in an

31:18.222 --> 31:28.838
appropriate fashion as the A&M plans are being 
formulated? Well, the Senate was called on.
