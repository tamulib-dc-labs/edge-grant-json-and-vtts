WEBVTT

00:03.203 --> 00:14.272
The new Texas Avenue had been built, and the new system building, and you helped plant those trees that led out east of the... Yes, yes, yes, that's right.

00:14.292 --> 00:17.079
How big, do you remember, how big were they when you all planted them?

00:17.200 --> 00:19.626
Were they... Oh, no, they couldn't have been...

00:19.842 --> 00:21.365
Five, six feet?

00:21.665 --> 00:25.071
I remember, this is what we talked about 60 years ago.

00:25.092 --> 00:26.374
But I would say that's about right.

00:27.175 --> 00:31.964
Now, of course, I suspect that some of those may have been there, and we just filled in.

00:32.104 --> 00:33.306
You know, maybe some of them died.

00:33.326 --> 00:34.489
I don't know what ever happened, but yes.

00:35.170 --> 00:38.416
Was a fellow named Bob Rucker part of your crew?

00:38.436 --> 00:39.077
Oh, no, no.

00:39.117 --> 00:41.922
He's way down the line, much later, much later.

00:42.202 --> 00:43.605
Oh, okay.

00:44.598 --> 00:46.660
The guy was in charge of the landscape.

00:46.680 --> 00:47.882
Oh, no, no, I was meaning.

00:47.922 --> 00:49.524
Hensel.

00:49.544 --> 00:49.944
Hensel.

00:50.084 --> 00:50.805
Yeah.

00:51.446 --> 00:53.669
No, I was meaning Rucker as a student.

00:53.929 --> 00:57.653
I've heard him talk about helping water trees on the campus.

00:57.673 --> 01:01.638
I don't, I remember the name, but I, no, I don't think so.

01:01.798 --> 01:02.078
Okay.

01:02.118 --> 01:03.360
He might have been.

01:03.380 --> 01:06.904
Describe Mr. Hensel and his responsibility as you recall it.

01:07.965 --> 01:13.812
Well, I didn't know Mr. Hensel personally because he was in charge of the whole campus, all the landscape and so forth.

01:14.500 --> 01:27.516
And so I reported to just about, well, matter of fact, it's right across the street from where Heaton Hall is now, right across there.

01:28.016 --> 01:30.439
There was no parking lot at that time.

01:30.459 --> 01:31.501
That's where it was located.

01:31.961 --> 01:32.742
They had a shop there.

01:33.503 --> 01:39.670
And let's see, the guy that was in charge of was Mike Ringhofer.

01:39.690 --> 01:43.495
He was an old-timer.

01:44.639 --> 01:49.791
I guess you'd call him a lieutenant or whatever it is in that shop.

01:50.532 --> 01:53.720
Now let's go back to your backup a couple years.

01:53.760 --> 01:57.188
As a freshman, you started out in Coast Artillery.

01:57.248 --> 01:58.009
Did you change?

01:58.430 --> 01:59.172
No, I didn't.

01:59.692 --> 02:00.955
Okay.

02:00.975 --> 02:03.781
But, you know, I didn't know that I even could change, you know, in those days.

02:03.922 --> 02:06.307
I was really a very ignorant person.

02:06.347 --> 02:12.642
What was it like for a farm boy to be a fish and to live off campus?

02:13.283 --> 02:14.967
How were you treated in the Corps?

02:15.107 --> 02:16.350
Well, first of all,

02:17.832 --> 02:23.222
I'm sure you know that the guys in the dorms referred to us as day dodgers.

02:23.723 --> 02:30.395
And so we were definitely second class citizens, although they accepted us, but you know, we were not of the inner group, so to speak.

02:31.256 --> 02:41.815
And another thing is that even though some of the day dodgers spent quite a bit of time in their military unit, I was so involved in

02:42.419 --> 02:44.841
uh, milking cows or all the other things.

02:44.941 --> 03:03.457
I, you know, I just, I just sort of reported when I had to and, and when we, uh, we had drill and that sort of thing in the afternoons, I would attend that, but I really wasn't a, uh, shall I say, a wholehearted member of, you know, where he had all this feeling of belonging and all that sort of stuff.

03:03.578 --> 03:04.819
I really felt like an outsider.

03:05.319 --> 03:08.202
But, let me say further, there were others just like me.

03:08.542 --> 03:10.384
I wouldn't have gone from that.

03:10.404 --> 03:12.105
As a freshman, were you hazed?

03:14.532 --> 03:16.996
Not really.

03:17.997 --> 03:24.186
But again, that was, I think, because I didn't live in the dorm and all that sort of stuff.

03:24.206 --> 03:29.133
I can't really recall if someone really, you know... You didn't get paddled?

03:29.474 --> 03:29.694
No.

03:31.917 --> 03:37.525
And since you worked, you didn't have to run errands in the dining hall as some freshmen did.

03:37.546 --> 03:39.949
I didn't meet in the dining hall.

03:40.621 --> 03:50.491
Let's see, did you participate in the drills late in the afternoon?

03:51.272 --> 03:51.972
Yes.

03:51.992 --> 03:52.293
Okay.

03:54.415 --> 04:06.527
Now, I don't know how often those were, yes, but also in those days, sometimes on Saturday mornings, I had to go, that was really the time that we did more stuff.

04:06.693 --> 04:08.997
What was your outfit's nickname?

04:09.999 --> 04:11.982
Did it have a... We didn't have one.

04:12.082 --> 04:14.786
It was just E-Battery Coast Artillery in those days.

04:14.927 --> 04:20.917
I'm sure there were others such as Bloody This or whatever, but if we had one, I don't remember.

04:20.957 --> 04:23.020
Did you acquire a nickname?

04:25.825 --> 04:28.269
Yes, but not very widely.

04:28.650 --> 04:30.152
Oh, what was it?

04:30.841 --> 04:42.772
Since my name is Skrbonik and it's so difficult, you know, I think my roommate, my sophomore year, called him Skrbonik.

04:42.992 --> 04:44.594
So therefore, my name was Skru.

04:44.914 --> 04:46.055
Skru.

04:46.976 --> 04:49.638
And that really was, you know, fairly, you know.

04:50.579 --> 04:57.746
What were the courses that you took those first years that you remember now as being important to you?

04:58.807 --> 04:59.127
Well,

05:01.908 --> 05:06.773
Obviously, the one that was called Fish and Game, that was probably the big one.

05:08.374 --> 05:20.966
I'm sure I took history and English and I took that chemistry course, which I dearly, really hated because I had no preparation for it whatsoever.

05:21.507 --> 05:23.749
I wasn't used to that sort of stuff.

05:23.869 --> 05:26.171
Particularly, I hadn't been attacked that first day.

05:26.812 --> 05:29.434
I lost my appetite for that.

05:30.781 --> 05:36.549
I don't recall really what they were other than just the normal beginning courses.

05:37.010 --> 05:44.220
Were there some teachers or counselors that you now realize were important to you later?

05:47.925 --> 05:49.207
Some people gave you advice?

05:49.227 --> 05:50.108
Yes, there was.

05:50.449 --> 05:51.911
There were a couple of them.

05:51.931 --> 05:57.919
Let me mention one who was not, well, he was in another department and I took a course under me later and that was Wendell Horsley.

05:58.270 --> 06:03.535
Wendell was head of the student, no, he wasn't either.

06:03.555 --> 06:06.498
He had something to do with student employment.

06:07.879 --> 06:10.241
And he really was a great guy.

06:10.361 --> 06:14.265
And I remember going in to see him, told him I needed student employment.

06:15.246 --> 06:25.155
And the thing that really impressed me was that I went in one time and went in about maybe about a week later, and he didn't

06:25.490 --> 06:26.912
He didn't have a receptionist.

06:27.153 --> 06:27.733
We just went in.

06:27.753 --> 06:33.562
It really impressed me because I was at the door and he walked in and he said, well, come on in, Scrivani.

06:33.582 --> 06:35.766
And I thought, my God, anybody remember that name?

06:36.347 --> 06:38.690
After I've seen all those dudes, it must be something special.

06:38.730 --> 06:39.271
And he was.

06:40.072 --> 06:41.074
And I took a course on it.

06:42.176 --> 06:43.337
He taught a forestry course.

06:43.397 --> 06:44.359
I think it was interesting.

06:45.320 --> 06:48.325
He was really very good, too.

06:49.587 --> 06:53.252
But one who really did also impress me, he's had a lot to do with him.

06:54.114 --> 07:04.649
I told you, my first major was ag, whatever it's called, ag education, I guess.

07:04.669 --> 07:07.653
Then the second time I majored in fish and game.

07:07.853 --> 07:14.703
And what happened was that I needed all the money that I could put together to stay in school.

07:16.045 --> 07:18.008
And the NYA permitted us...

07:18.460 --> 07:29.570
to only 40 hours a week, no, 40 hours a month in which to work and get paid 30 cents an hour.

07:30.111 --> 07:32.513
Room and board was $12, so there was my 12 bucks.

07:33.133 --> 07:39.539
But I had some good friends who helped me out by saying, look, I'm going home or something.

07:39.559 --> 07:40.560
I don't need this money.

07:41.601 --> 07:44.564
You go and you under Ringhoffer.

07:44.584 --> 07:48.147
And Ringhoffer knew that we were doing this.

07:48.717 --> 07:56.786
And I put in my time, there's no question about that, and I would sign their name for them working.

07:57.227 --> 08:01.992
When they got paid, they would give me the money, so that was my little extra money.

08:02.012 --> 08:13.746
Anyway, so when I was a sophomore then, I guess, I just couldn't, I had to do, there were so many hours of lab.

08:14.671 --> 08:18.517
and class time that I really couldn't get in 40 hours of work.

08:20.119 --> 08:25.207
And again, I was faced with the question, shall I stay in this or what shall I do?

08:26.629 --> 08:32.498
And I really sort of, and I had a course under Dan Davis.

08:34.581 --> 08:36.204
Commonly, there's one of those nicknames.

08:36.284 --> 08:41.131
He was called Cigar Dan in what was called Rural Sociology.

08:41.151 --> 08:41.792
And I liked it.

08:42.903 --> 08:48.132
I looked through the catalog, and lo and behold, they had 12 hours.

08:49.374 --> 08:50.535
There were no labs, nothing.

08:51.176 --> 08:58.929
So I could really go to school 12 hours, and the other time was free, so I could learn money of different kinds.

08:59.670 --> 09:05.620
So I did a lot of things that I did, as I told you, worked for those guys.

09:06.595 --> 09:11.635
I would work for someone else who had a job in a bowling alley setting bowling pins.

09:11.956 --> 09:15.148
And they would, you know, give me that money at night and others.

09:15.168 --> 09:16.875
So that's how I sort of worked.

09:18.037 --> 09:22.442
Well, we are perhaps off the subject of what we want now, but that's where we are at the moment.

09:23.023 --> 09:27.568
So that's why I really didn't know much about sociology.

09:27.588 --> 09:31.954
But I said, if I'm going to stay in school, I'm going to have to do something else.

09:31.974 --> 09:37.240
So I changed the sociology based on that particular thing, I think, more than anything else.

09:37.400 --> 09:39.342
And Dan Davis was one of those who got me there.

09:39.723 --> 09:43.147
Describe him as a teacher and as a person.

09:43.287 --> 09:47.352
He was a great guy, a fine guy.

09:47.990 --> 09:53.896
He was a very interesting teacher, very interesting.

09:53.916 --> 09:58.661
And he had a certain clever way of presenting his material.

09:58.721 --> 10:00.143
I can't describe it exactly.

10:00.163 --> 10:03.506
He would sort of half close one of those eyes.

10:04.067 --> 10:06.569
He was so convinced that I just enjoyed it.

10:06.689 --> 10:12.175
Anyway, the reason he had, and he was known as Cigar Dan, the reason for that is that

10:12.863 --> 10:23.239
He would take a cigar, and later, after I got my degrees and came back, he was still on the faculty, and so I shared an office with him in those open space.

10:23.680 --> 10:26.144
There were about four of us professors in one room.

10:26.524 --> 10:40.626
Anyway, Dan would take a cigar and cut it in half, and when he left home, he would light that cigar and take a few puffs, and when he got to school, he would rub it out.

10:40.893 --> 10:50.308
go to his class, between classes, he'd come right out, light that cigar again, a few puffs, and so that cigar, half a cigar less, whole day.

10:50.769 --> 10:55.156
I think that, and so many people saw him, that's where he got the nickname, Cigar Dan.

10:56.118 --> 10:57.140
But he was really very good.

10:57.681 --> 11:04.071
And in fact, that nickname was a kind of a symbol of a token of affection, wasn't it?

11:04.171 --> 11:05.854
Oh yes, oh yes, yes, yes.

11:05.834 --> 11:08.238
No one would have said anything negative about him.

11:08.278 --> 11:10.262
He would have just said, oh, and that's something else.

11:10.522 --> 11:20.680
He never really got credit for this, but there was a professor, Dan Russell, in those days, that got credit, and don't misunderstand me, he deserved to have credit.

11:21.001 --> 11:26.070
He was really the organizer of the Project House movement.

11:26.506 --> 11:41.076
And let me say right now that there are many of us, really thousands of students, that owe our a whole lot to him because we never thought of going to school paying those, even though they were not exorbitant, but we didn't have the money, so that's how we stayed in school.

11:41.116 --> 11:45.144
So Dan got credit for running it, but Dan Davis was his right-hand man.

11:45.164 --> 11:46.607
See, they were in the same department.

11:46.975 --> 11:56.004
And Dan Davis did all the ordering of the bread, you know, with the bread companies, getting secondhand bread and all that sort of stuff.

11:56.865 --> 11:57.846
And he was a great actor.

11:58.007 --> 12:00.910
He was a great, great person.

12:00.930 --> 12:08.578
So was he probably a key influence in your becoming a Rural Sociology Specialist?

12:08.758 --> 12:09.318
Yeah, probably.

12:10.079 --> 12:10.840
Yeah, probably so.

12:11.208 --> 12:15.837
Now, during those first couple of years, you didn't have much extra money.

12:16.358 --> 12:16.819
No.

12:16.839 --> 12:19.684
So what did you and your buddies do for a good time?

12:22.349 --> 12:26.297
They were not the good times that a lot of these guys had, believe me.

12:27.340 --> 12:30.804
Oh, his kid, Dick Hervey, who's a classmate of mine, he was president like that.

12:30.864 --> 12:35.069
I didn't even know Dick until he was a senior, you know, and he was a big wheel on campus.

12:35.089 --> 12:41.956
So I was, you know, I spent my time working and studying.

12:42.797 --> 12:47.402
And I, my own admission, I wasn't as smart as a lot of those guys were.

12:47.422 --> 12:49.605
And I spent lots and lots of hours studying.

12:49.885 --> 12:56.993
And I didn't, if you want to talk about, in college, I didn't have what you'd call a good time.

12:57.800 --> 13:00.143
Really.

13:00.163 --> 13:05.349
But did y'all go somewhere for amusement on a Saturday night occasionally?

13:05.369 --> 13:06.411
Well, I would go home.

13:07.051 --> 13:07.452
Okay.

13:07.472 --> 13:08.173
Yeah.

13:08.193 --> 13:14.521
And by the way, all through my college life, my mother, I would take my clothes home.

13:15.442 --> 13:22.290
And after I got there, she would wash them and iron them or whatever it was.

13:23.212 --> 13:25.174
And so I'd

13:25.627 --> 13:30.174
I don't remember ever sending any clothes to the laundry as most everybody else did in those days.

13:30.715 --> 13:36.765
What is now Farm Road 60 going straight to Snook, did that road exist in those days?

13:36.985 --> 13:37.987
Sort of.

13:38.007 --> 13:39.850
Was there a bridge over the river?

13:40.110 --> 13:53.271
Yes, and as you go over the bridge now, let's say you're going west, if you look on the right-hand side,

13:53.420 --> 13:56.023
You can see some old pillars of the old bridge.

13:57.625 --> 14:16.945
And there was a winding road, and I want to also say that when I was in college, particularly the first couple of years or so, that was simply a sandy kind of a, just one set of tracks, that's all.

14:18.047 --> 14:20.389
And if I ever, and when I went home,

14:20.977 --> 14:37.613
Instead of thumbing it, going directly, I would go to Bryan and thumb it to Caldwell and come back in, which was probably, oh I would say probably a 40 mile trip, but it could have been easily 15, but it's put this way.

14:37.733 --> 14:42.478
If I ever got out on that road and the car was coming, I had no problem, that'd sure take you.

14:42.978 --> 14:49.785
But you couldn't count on one being there for three or four hours at a time.

14:50.356 --> 14:53.482
You know, that really wasn't my transportation back and forth.

14:53.562 --> 14:55.225
I mean, how I got there in those days.

14:58.210 --> 14:59.693
Let's see.

15:00.214 --> 15:01.496
How did you dress for class?

15:01.536 --> 15:03.079
Did you wear a uniform?

15:03.119 --> 15:05.203
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

15:05.223 --> 15:10.272
So I spent two years in, you know, ROTC required.

15:10.522 --> 15:14.346
The second two years, we all wore uniforms incidentally.

15:14.366 --> 15:20.191
Regardless, we just were not full ROTC people.

15:20.772 --> 15:24.015
And we didn't attend drills except in the project houses.

15:24.515 --> 15:34.144
Even though we were not in the ROTC program, we still had retreat in the afternoons, all of us, dressed in uniform and all that sort of stuff.

15:34.925 --> 15:39.229
And by the way, even in those days, even those who

15:40.188 --> 15:49.441
Even those who could not pass the physical exam wore uniforms, similar to ours.

15:50.422 --> 15:58.894
We had an identifying patch over here that identified our, like I was in the Coast Artillery, it was a red patch and so on.

15:58.914 --> 16:04.221
The guys who were in Signal Corps had a common orange one and a chemical

16:04.403 --> 16:16.862
what are they called, chemical something, they, you know, each one, so even then they had a patch, I don't know what it said, but you could identify them automatically, but everybody wore you in the swamp.

16:16.882 --> 16:20.267
I guess they were in a wheelchair, I remember everybody in a wheelchair, but nobody did.

16:20.948 --> 16:25.094
As you look back now on those four years, what were the toughest courses for you?

16:29.160 --> 16:31.744
I would have to say the chemistry again.

16:34.171 --> 16:36.236
And you had not had chemistry in high school.

16:36.256 --> 16:38.682
No, and I didn't even know what chemistry was.

16:38.963 --> 16:42.673
I just totally ignored the whole thing.

16:42.693 --> 16:51.555
And fortunately I made very good grades, but I say again, I did not have the

16:52.447 --> 16:55.913
I was not smart in quotes like a lot of the guys were.

16:55.953 --> 16:59.580
Didn't have the background, but I worked like a son of a gun.

16:59.660 --> 17:01.384
I studied and I studied and I studied.

17:02.626 --> 17:07.295
Did you even compute GPAs then?

17:07.315 --> 17:08.978
Oh yeah, yeah.

17:09.479 --> 17:15.670
I made, let's see, I would say after the first year,

17:17.742 --> 17:19.866
thereabouts, maybe a year and a half.

17:20.547 --> 17:24.854
I was what you call a distinguished student every semester.

17:25.676 --> 17:27.920
And that was, you had to be average to do that.

17:28.020 --> 17:28.861
Yeah, that's good.

17:29.382 --> 17:29.903
That's good.

17:30.184 --> 17:42.906
But again, I took the kinds of courses where I was interested in, you know, in my field and so forth, I didn't do blah blah blah, except I did branch off because

17:44.033 --> 17:51.466
In the meantime, the war came on and we had conscription and all that sort of stuff.

17:52.548 --> 18:01.384
And so, by the way, one other thing I did while I was in college those few years, in order to earn some more money, I joined the National Guard in Caldwell.

18:02.697 --> 18:05.341
And we got a dollar for every time we attended a drill.

18:05.361 --> 18:10.249
So I wouldn't hitchhike to call them for a drill.

18:10.269 --> 18:18.842
So what happened then was that the newspaper battalion came out and said, anyone that's in the National Guard, check out now.

18:19.904 --> 18:23.710
Because you've been called to active duty and there you go.

18:23.730 --> 18:28.317
I was probably, I don't know, well I guess a sophomore maybe.

18:28.837 --> 18:29.659
Maybe a junior.

18:30.040 --> 18:36.012
And I was fortunate that there was a Caldwell unit.

18:36.032 --> 18:43.909
So I hitchhiked it over to Caldwell and called up the commander of the unit, who by the way was an old ag graduate.

18:44.598 --> 19:03.079
and they were prominent in Caldwell, and said, look, the student newspaper said check out, I don't know what to do, whatever happened, he said, look, don't do that, since you've got a chance to, you're in college, you've got a chance to get a commission and all that, you have other avenues.

19:04.207 --> 19:16.181
I'm really inundated with people who want to join this unit because they want to go as a local unit together, and I'll get you a discharge from the National Guard, so I've got that.

19:16.561 --> 19:32.239
And anyway, so along came a program called V-7 in the Navy, which said, in effect, if you will pass a physical for the Navy, we will let you go to school, and you must take nine hours of college math.

19:33.367 --> 19:37.953
And once you graduate, we will take you in and we will take you in as a seaman.

19:38.073 --> 19:42.558
You'll be there for about a month and you'll be a midshipman at some school and so forth.

19:42.578 --> 19:43.579
So I signed up with that.

19:44.320 --> 19:45.882
And so we're talking about others.

19:45.902 --> 19:51.409
So I even took trig, trigonometry, and made an A in it, by the way.

19:51.569 --> 19:55.354
But I didn't understand it because I didn't memorize the stuff.

19:55.374 --> 20:01.761
Talking about favorite teachers, one of the guys I really liked was my trig teacher.

20:01.781 --> 20:03.103
His name was John Hill.

20:04.282 --> 20:12.873
He was a real tall, I don't know if you've ever heard of this guy, he was a real tall, lanky, looked like Iggy by a crane.

20:12.893 --> 20:25.610
Anyway he, remember we were all Aggies sitting in the classroom and this is in the main building on campus at that time.

20:25.770 --> 20:26.351
Academic?

20:26.371 --> 20:27.032
Academic, yeah.

20:28.396 --> 20:38.432
And he kind of in his stride, kind of country stride, walks in and puts his book down on the desk and he looked at us and he says, really a country looking guy.

20:39.574 --> 20:42.820
And he looked at us and says, and these are his words I remember.

20:43.881 --> 20:46.185
He said, look here, fellas.

20:47.617 --> 20:50.603
I ain't never taught something like this before and I don't know how it's going to go.

20:50.943 --> 20:54.630
We all look at each other and say, man, what a crazy nut we got here.

20:55.131 --> 20:59.941
But he was undoubtedly the best guy and he was very, very good.

20:59.961 --> 21:03.007
And not only a very good teacher, but he was a very fine person.

21:03.888 --> 21:06.874
If a kid ever slept and fell asleep in class.

21:07.310 --> 21:12.296
He'd be the kind to say, now wait a minute, he'd say, somebody wake Mr. Jones.

21:12.977 --> 21:19.846
And Mr. Jones would say, anyway, he'd say, now Mr. Jones, I don't believe your parents would like you to do this.

21:19.986 --> 21:21.768
You know they're paying for you to go to school.

21:21.849 --> 21:24.532
He was just outstanding.

21:25.593 --> 21:26.474
Did he have a nickname?

21:27.235 --> 21:28.457
I don't know.

21:29.146 --> 21:32.894
I don't remember one for him.

21:32.914 --> 21:40.490
But let me talk about nicknames, I'm going to digress a little bit, because after you talk to me about this, there were a number of them that had nicknames.

21:40.530 --> 21:46.362
For example there was a guy, Mogford, he was called Cotton Joe.

21:47.033 --> 21:53.300
And he was over in agronomy, and he was in charge of the cotton ball and all that sort of stuff.

21:53.320 --> 21:55.763
But anyway, he had the common name of Cotton Joe.

21:56.043 --> 21:58.586
There was another guy you might remember or heard of.

21:58.606 --> 22:00.368
His name was I. P. Trotter.

22:00.668 --> 22:03.551
He was dean of, I don't know what he was.

22:03.992 --> 22:05.293
No, he was, anyway.

22:05.313 --> 22:14.003
And of course his nickname was I. P. And there was also a guy over in

22:14.759 --> 22:18.947
What was at that time, I guess you could call it business.

22:20.615 --> 22:22.457
They probably named the administration.

22:23.218 --> 22:27.243
But Tom Leland was in charge of it at that time.

22:27.764 --> 22:34.813
There was a guy over there that taught a course that we had to take, by the way, in sociology by the name of Hamilton, and his nickname was Mouse.

22:35.514 --> 22:37.035
He was a little bit of a mousy sort of fellow.

22:37.116 --> 22:37.776
That really fit him.

22:38.317 --> 22:39.458
And he was a tough joker.

22:40.099 --> 22:47.989
And a lot of the kids, because they would delay taking his course as long as they possibly could.

22:47.969 --> 22:49.335
Cigar Davis.

22:49.898 --> 22:53.855
There's another guy in the math department named Square Root Jackson.

22:53.875 --> 22:54.478
You ever hear him?

22:55.161 --> 22:55.583
Okay.

22:55.917 --> 23:02.367
Am I correct that supposedly the square root of the number taking the class would pass it?

23:02.827 --> 23:03.188
I don't know.

23:03.348 --> 23:05.071
I don't know that, but that was a nickname.

23:05.091 --> 23:10.118
Well, one former student told me that his class had the reputation for being so tough.

23:10.879 --> 23:10.979
Yeah.

23:10.999 --> 23:12.201
That that was their tease.

23:12.221 --> 23:15.346
I have a story to tell on that one.

23:15.967 --> 23:18.511
You probably, you remember John Ken Cannon maybe?

23:19.111 --> 23:19.512
Okay.

23:20.032 --> 23:22.815
John Ken Cannon, he taught math too.

23:23.516 --> 23:27.059
And he tells us as honest truth now, whether it's true or not.

23:27.360 --> 23:29.922
You know, John was a big storyteller.

23:30.743 --> 23:38.892
He was on the faculty and he tells a story about having a class in an academic building, about on the second or third floor.

23:39.893 --> 23:43.837
And he said while he was there all of a sudden, he said he heard this scraping outside.

23:43.897 --> 23:46.039
There was a ledge there, one of the windows.

23:46.694 --> 23:52.923
He said he went out there to see what it was, he said it was Square Root, and said it was John's story.

23:52.943 --> 23:57.690
He said, I know these guys are cheating, I'm going to catch them.

23:57.710 --> 23:59.213
That was John's story, it was probably true.

24:00.294 --> 24:13.073
Another one, oh, there was a guy by the name of Potter that taught in the biology department.

24:14.403 --> 24:19.469
And he taught a course, I think it was called Comparative Anatomy.

24:20.210 --> 24:26.278
And I think that's also when I was in the fishing game, I had to take that course that was required.

24:27.219 --> 24:32.706
And we all had our own individual dogfish that we had to cut up.

24:32.806 --> 24:35.830
And so his name was Dog Fish Potter.

24:36.070 --> 24:36.451
Dog.

24:36.471 --> 24:38.393
Everybody called him Dog Fish Potter.

24:38.413 --> 24:39.395
He was good, by the way.

24:40.977 --> 24:42.098
Let's see.

24:42.078 --> 24:44.722
Those are some of the names that I recall on hand.

24:44.802 --> 24:46.505
I'm sorry we really digressed.

24:46.585 --> 24:47.887
I'm way away from home.

24:48.928 --> 24:54.056
As you're beginning your sophomore year, the war in Europe starts.

24:54.356 --> 24:54.677
Okay.

24:55.338 --> 25:03.850
Did your family and other families in Snook and Caldwell still have relatives in the old country?

25:04.252 --> 25:06.976
Did you all have any direct relatives?

25:08.098 --> 25:09.200
Not that I know of.

25:09.340 --> 25:11.744
They probably did, but I was not aware.

25:11.784 --> 25:13.386
You weren't aware, all right.

25:13.747 --> 25:22.721
When did you begin to, you and your buddies, when did you all begin to think about World War II and the war in Europe and its effect on you?

25:25.145 --> 25:29.972
I remember on December the 7th of that famous day,

25:30.205 --> 25:32.047
Where were you when you heard the news?

25:32.248 --> 25:40.778
I was in, there were four of us in our room, roommates, in our room in the project house.

25:41.659 --> 25:45.905
Project house number seven, called the Leon County Project House.

25:45.925 --> 25:48.488
And we were just sort of, I don't know what we were doing, just sort of fooling around.

25:48.568 --> 25:50.010
It was kind of a day, kind of like a day.

25:52.613 --> 25:55.757
And it came on and it was on the radio.

25:57.155 --> 26:04.283
And I remember one of my roommates, who was named John Box, by the way, he later was on the Extension Service faculty.

26:04.323 --> 26:10.811
Anyway, I remember him saying, ha, those crazy Japs, we're going to wipe them out in six weeks.

26:11.732 --> 26:17.879
And I remember that very well, but that's where I heard about it first.

26:18.700 --> 26:20.582
Did you even know where Pearl Harbor was?

26:20.622 --> 26:21.323
No.

26:22.298 --> 26:33.979
I was a sixth grader and the next day at school, our teacher looked it up on the map for us and showed us where Pearl Harbor was.

26:34.212 --> 26:38.978
Later I got to visit there, by the way, on one of my shifts in the Navy.

26:38.998 --> 26:50.093
Alright, so during those undergraduate years, you said that you sometimes ate your lunch at the YMCA.

26:50.874 --> 26:56.642
Were there other activities at the YMCA that were important to you and your buddies?

26:58.040 --> 27:00.483
On one side of it, there was a confectionary.

27:00.703 --> 27:02.745
They were down in the basement.

27:02.825 --> 27:04.247
I don't know if you've probably heard of this before.

27:04.287 --> 27:08.932
There was a guy by the name of Doc Lipscomb, I believe, that was rented.

27:08.952 --> 27:11.355
It was a very, very popular place for Aggies.

27:11.715 --> 27:15.980
They got, well that's what it was, the confectionary.

27:16.000 --> 27:23.308
They got the, in those days, cherry cokes and whatnot.

27:23.368 --> 27:24.890
Those kind of things were very popular.

27:25.130 --> 27:26.832
So that was another.

27:27.267 --> 27:34.204
Oh also I remember there also I think was a swimming pool down there, I think.

27:35.989 --> 27:40.500
I don't remember much about it but there sure was.

27:40.902 --> 27:45.792
The major thing there was at Bowling Alley.

27:45.872 --> 27:47.796
Of course, I spent my time there.

27:48.257 --> 27:51.263
Did you have any memory of Mr. Cashin?

27:51.744 --> 27:52.625
Oh, yeah.

27:52.645 --> 27:53.307
Describe him.

27:53.387 --> 27:55.391
Not really well.

27:55.451 --> 27:56.253
I knew he was.

27:56.353 --> 27:58.978
I better back up and admit I really didn't know him that well.

28:00.308 --> 28:06.538
The YMCA also was a home for some campus religious activities.

28:07.159 --> 28:08.501
Did those include you?

28:08.882 --> 28:09.082
No.

28:09.502 --> 28:13.469
Did you go to worship services while you were an undergraduate?

28:13.970 --> 28:14.230
Yes.

28:14.530 --> 28:25.067
My freshman year, I went to College Avenue Baptist Church because the people that I milked the cows for went for it.

28:26.498 --> 28:37.875
And some of the big names in that church were, at that time, there was a very, people like the guy by the name of Judge Barron, you probably heard of him, and those were some of the leaders in that church.

28:38.513 --> 28:40.976
Now, you grew up in what denomination?

28:43.419 --> 28:46.943
Originally, the original name of it was Czech Moravian Brethren.

28:47.804 --> 28:48.085
Okay.

28:48.745 --> 28:56.054
And as time went on, it became, they dropped the Czech and just became Moravian Brethren.

28:56.074 --> 28:58.678
Later, they dropped the Moravian, and now it's just Brethren.

28:58.878 --> 29:02.702
And I'm still a member of Brethren Church here in Bryan Conference Station.

29:02.722 --> 29:02.923
All right.

29:02.943 --> 29:07.288
When you were an undergraduate, did you ever go home to Snook to go to church or...

29:07.707 --> 29:09.309
Not deliberately go to church now.

29:09.349 --> 29:11.492
I went there because I was at home.

29:12.474 --> 29:19.344
And as I said, I tried to go home as much as I could on weekends because I needed a fresh set of clothes.

29:19.364 --> 29:20.025
That sort of thing.

29:21.206 --> 29:28.737
And I presume occasionally you might bring a little bit of food too when you were living in the project house.

29:30.320 --> 29:30.740
Let's see.

29:32.803 --> 29:36.128
Some pranks that you and your buddies played on somebody.

29:38.285 --> 29:38.966
Good bull.

29:42.189 --> 29:45.092
Unfortunately, if you want to put it that way, I was not a prankster.

29:46.113 --> 29:48.616
I don't know if I, and I certainly wasn't an oddball.

29:48.676 --> 29:54.202
I was among our 36 that was in the house, but we never did, we didn't pull pranks on anybody.

29:54.222 --> 29:55.703
Did anybody pull any on y'all?

29:57.585 --> 29:58.466
Not that I can recall.

29:58.846 --> 29:59.527
Okay.

29:59.547 --> 30:04.292
That wasn't because we were all that studious and all, we were just boys and that's all.

30:04.407 --> 30:10.060
Now, describe the general group living in the Leon County house.

30:10.982 --> 30:18.259
A majority of them were from Leon County, and that was Marquet, Centerville.

30:20.825 --> 30:21.927
Buffalo, Jewett.

30:22.092 --> 30:43.392
Yeah, Buffalo Jewett and my roommate from even closer, ah shoot, was Joe Burton Nash, he was one of the smartest guys I ever knew, Norman G. And I guess probably, if I were just guessing, out of let's say 36 that lived there, probably 25.

30:43.793 --> 30:52.649
So we're from that county and the other 11 or 10 of them were kind of fill-ins because they had a room we could fill.

30:53.250 --> 30:58.059
Now, did you all have responsibilities for cleaning that building?

30:58.179 --> 30:59.442
Yes, complete.

30:59.822 --> 31:00.283
Okay.

31:00.938 --> 31:11.951
The freshmen had complete responsibility of, we just had a house mother, and incidentally her husband lived with her, but she was responsible for the food.

31:12.031 --> 31:15.856
But the freshmen all had to help do everything.

31:16.677 --> 31:19.901
Wash, well there were no dishwashers, anything like that.

31:20.361 --> 31:29.072
They had to set the tables, they had to wash the dishes, they had to help her, I don't know what degree, well I'm sure they'd peel potatoes and things like that.
