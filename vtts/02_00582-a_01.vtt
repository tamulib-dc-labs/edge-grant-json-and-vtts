WEBVTT

00:02.883 --> 00:04.986
before the first tape recorder failed. I want to 
know how you became interested in art. Well, I

00:08.610 --> 00:18.663
became interested in art, namely, through my 
mother was a wonderful artist in her own right, and

00:08.610 --> 00:18.663
I was a pencil artist, essentially, when I was a 
kid. I used to study her work. She took art in San

00:21.206 --> 00:27.574
Antonio, you know, José Opa. became interested at 
that time. I think he just had an innate feeling for

00:29.109 --> 00:38.724
it all along that I wanted to do it, but I was 
constantly filling notebooks and composition

00:29.109 --> 00:38.724
books with cartoons and mainly core designs. When 
I was in high school, I started in grade school when

00:38.764 --> 00:56.751
I did quite a bit of scratching around with crayons 
and things, but, uh, and, uh, I found a kind of a

00:38.764 --> 00:56.751
soulmate or another companion, classmate that 
loved art too, and then Tom Steele, and we both, uh,

00:57.794 --> 01:04.020
I started car designs and worked on the high school 
annual. And I started using pen and ink as an

01:05.422 --> 01:08.945
essential medium then. But the art, of course, it 
grew strong and strong all the time. And when I

01:14.711 --> 01:23.920
finished school, I had done considerable

01:14.711 --> 01:23.920
what's called automobile designing, 
essentially. I took some lessons under a lady who

01:24.355 --> 01:27.299
was in China paint. They taught China paint, and I 
took some watercolor under her, and I got to feel

01:27.620 --> 01:31.746
the watercolor then. But then there was a time, of 
course, when I graduated from high school to go to

01:32.667 --> 01:37.535
A&M. It hurt my father's insistence. I had no 
intention of going to A&M, because I knew it was

01:40.880 --> 01:47.650
military, and not to have a deeper version of 
anything as discipline and regimentation. So I

01:47.870 --> 01:49.713
went on to A&M. But he was certain that I'd take 
electrical engineering. He had one of the Quarrel

01:54.308 --> 02:07.724
boys named Charlie Dickerson, and he had a very 
wonderful success, and he went to San Francisco

01:54.308 --> 02:07.724
and installed all the electrical phases of that. I 
guess he did, but anyhow. But Papa said, now

02:08.805 --> 02:10.146
there's the man. He said, I want you to be like 
Charlie Dickerson, be a great engineer. Well,

02:14.471 --> 02:15.392
there was a German. There was strict 
regimentation in the German family. It was bad

02:20.338 --> 02:21.299
enough. Everything was mandatory. It was 
suggested by the parents. But I went to A&M. I said,

02:25.321 --> 02:26.303
well, I'll do it. And I did. And I had a rugged time of 
it. I got in the military. And I was a pretty good

02:32.292 --> 02:34.836
gold brick in that. Then I took this EE.

02:40.485 --> 02:43.210
And I think Dr. Bolton was the head of the 
electrical engineering department. But I

02:43.230 --> 02:44.292
flunked every course. I wouldn't bring this in 
very forcibly. But it was a show that how your kids

02:46.074 --> 02:48.278
are going to react. And I ran mad. God, I must have 
ran mad. And I passed one course, and that was

02:51.362 --> 02:57.671
English under Dr. D.B. Cofer. And I remember he was 
very wonderful. He was, you know, a genteel soul.

03:02.218 --> 03:03.721
He said, you have a talent for writing. And so I read 
all these essays and composition stories, and he

03:04.261 --> 03:11.673
read them out to the class as an example of what... 
But, of course, that was just an incidental... I

03:15.359 --> 03:19.447
think it goes hand in hand with art to some extent. 
It's an emotional experience. And I love putting

03:21.531 --> 03:23.195
down things in words. I started, I'd say, at A&M. 
But that didn't carry me through my freshman year.

03:31.306 --> 03:32.568
because I flucked everything in. It was nice to 
have. But I did, and I don't know what the procedure

03:35.652 --> 03:42.140
was, but I was told that I didn't make my grades, and 
it'd be best to go ahead and retire from school. And

03:43.041 --> 03:44.162
I was worried. I mean, Papa found out about it. He 
was awful put out with me because I couldn't pass my

03:46.786 --> 03:49.790
grades. So I went to Dr. Brazell. I think the 
registrar, Friley, told me to go see him. So he had a

03:56.558 --> 03:59.562
nice visit with W.B. Brazell. And he's the one that 
said, well, this is a shame. That should happen to

04:02.715 --> 04:03.896
you. But I know you want to take a lot to him. I want to 
go to Chicago and study art. He said, well,

04:08.281 --> 04:11.104
somewhere we can work this thing out. I'm going to 
call your father, which he did. I told Papa, I said,

04:12.686 --> 04:14.668
now, listen here. Don't go ahead and be too strict 
with this boy. And artistic talents. And Papa was,

04:20.654 --> 04:24.198
but I was sorry and everything, blah, blah. And he 
went on. So we decided what course to take. And I

04:28.042 --> 04:30.405
said, how about architecture? I'd been up to visit 
the architecture department. I got to know some of

04:32.808 --> 04:33.849
them. They were wonderful. I had the department at 
that time named Joseph Kellogg from the

04:35.171 --> 04:41.120
University of Illinois, and they had brought him 
in there. It was very genteel, wonderful. But he

04:44.084 --> 04:49.331
gave me new inspiration and new incentive. So I 
took my four years of architecture and came along.

04:56.002 --> 05:02.873
just the opposite from what had happened in 
England, but I had made good grades, and I think I

04:56.002 --> 05:02.873
got some honors with it at the time. I don't recall 
all these art studies. And I finished that and got

05:05.858 --> 05:09.825
my M, a B, A in architecture. At the same time, I was 
working, as I told you, on the college end. I had 21

05:13.932 --> 05:16.255
and 22, and they were work outs. The art, uh, art 
director, whatever it is, art editor. laying out

05:20.740 --> 05:22.763
everything, making all the color play. If you've 
seen it in the 21, 22, you'll see that it wasn't a

05:22.783 --> 05:27.930
masterful work, but it was done for service. But it 
took, you served all my time. And besides that, I

05:30.734 --> 05:36.221
was rooming with part of that football team. But I 
enjoyed that, too, with Bill McMillan, the

05:37.203 --> 05:39.886
quarterback. He was the one that was on Beat Center 
on New Year's Day, which was wonderful. It was his

05:44.973 --> 05:47.777
pass, and Bill McMillan, and then another 
All-American. But they were all from the

05:48.955 --> 05:51.999
University of Tennessee named Bill Bradley.

05:55.623 --> 05:57.606
But I took as much of that as I could. But I could not 
go along with this routine that was happening. I

06:03.233 --> 06:10.061
had to get out of the room in the dormitory so I could 
finish my, essentially the annual work, which had

06:03.233 --> 06:10.061
to come out. So that's when I took this place, I saw 
Gaslight Hall, and I went up there to see what it was

06:11.002 --> 06:14.787
like. I saw the top story there, and I said, Lord, 
that would be an ideal studio. So I roamed around up

06:18.588 --> 06:23.296
there, no creaky stairs and everything else, and I 
said, my God, this is it. So I went to see Colonel

06:24.459 --> 06:26.202
Ashburn about it. He was coming down at that time. 
He said, no, I don't want you to do that. It's a fire

06:30.129 --> 06:33.254
trap, but it's hazardous, climbing the steps, no. 
I said, oh, so I just wish you could let me. He said,

06:35.579 --> 06:37.542
well, we gave it every consideration. But I never 
think nothing ever came out of it. He didn't make a

06:40.480 --> 06:41.681
pitch of mine. So I just said, I'm going to go on up 
there anyhow. Got me some fresh fish to bring up

06:43.743 --> 06:48.067
there. All my art materials up in my files. This was 
a breeze. I worked more than put in many, many

06:51.710 --> 06:56.374
hours, 16, 18 to 20 hours a day. But I got the annual 
out and finished my other work. But that shows what

06:59.216 --> 07:06.162
the environment and the proper circumstances can 
do for you, right set up. But I fell right in line. So

07:08.673 --> 07:19.068
I went on and participated, you say, in part of the 
master degree work in architecture, which I

07:08.673 --> 07:19.068
devoted to landscape architecture under Fritz 
Dr. Hensel. And I had a wonderful time with him. But

07:20.690 --> 07:24.075
I got my thesis done, everything, but again, math.

07:26.298 --> 07:31.105
But I mean, I was looking, I got math, but I'm not a 
figurehead, I'm not a statistician. So I just went

07:31.586 --> 07:34.851
ahead and got out of school. I like about, I don't 
know, about four or five hours to get my math I could

07:38.609 --> 07:44.556
have gone to summer school and rounded it out 
there, but I said, heck with it, I'm just going to go

07:38.609 --> 07:44.556
ahead. I said, I've got to be A, and that's nice 
enough. I went home again, started with my car

07:49.863 --> 07:54.709
designing at Tom Steele. And Papa finally said, 
now listen, hey, see, I sent you to A&M. get a

08:01.154 --> 08:05.340
reasonable education anyhow, or the semblance of 
it. But he said, you've done well. And I said, it's

08:07.022 --> 08:09.505
time for you to get out on your own. So I went to 
Dallas. Took a train. He packed me, put me on the

08:12.169 --> 08:15.132
train with a suitcase. And I kept going there. I 
lived high off the hog with the family long enough.

08:18.657 --> 08:19.919
And so I went to Dallas. And I rummaged the street. I 
had a time in Dallas. I'm finding a cheap boarding

08:23.604 --> 08:25.546
house. Stayed there. Had no money. And I went 
around and started making the rounds of the

08:30.365 --> 08:34.570
commercial artists, essentially. So I finally 
found one man that took more or less the edge of my

08:35.051 --> 08:39.796
name, John Doctoroff. And he was a wonderful 
pencil artist. He did pencil portraits. And he did

08:42.259 --> 08:46.544
what's called average weight, saddles and shoes 
and everything else. So I showed him my work. But I

08:47.546 --> 08:49.909
won't say what exactly his terminology was. But he 
looked at my drawings. I said, man, here I am. He'd

08:52.472 --> 08:54.915
answer, oh, my god. I don't want to repeat that. And 
he said, what are you showing me this crap for? I

09:00.740 --> 09:03.625
said, whoa, is it that bad? She said, you have 
potential. Now if you want to come to work with me,

09:06.690 --> 09:11.718
but I cannot remunerate you. I can't say that word, 
remunerate you. And just go with me. I think,

09:16.285 --> 09:22.435
again, I said, well, I'm just grateful for a chance 
to be with you and have a rub off on what you're

09:16.285 --> 09:22.435
doing. I said, I have tremendous admiration for 
your work. So she set me up with no salary, nothing.

09:28.178 --> 09:37.310
But I subsisted on, then I did some signs, show 
cards, just went with this for, I think it was

09:28.178 --> 09:37.310
Grant's, it was a big store there, but on the side. 
Then I posed for Wilson's, no, for the

09:37.331 --> 09:53.072
advertising, for the movie type of thing they had 
at that time as a model for Victor Wilson Clothes

09:37.331 --> 09:53.072
and some other drugstores. That's the best money I 
ever made. It was about $8 an hour, just posing

09:55.971 --> 09:59.439
clothes. But nobody ever knows. That's another 
bracket I got into as a model. Now, when was this,

10:03.428 --> 10:04.450
Buck? It was in 22 and 23. I got, because I got out of 
A&M in 22, which is essentially 1923. It was hard

10:13.032 --> 10:22.533
living, but the main thing was that I was so 
engrossed with what I wanted to do in my career that

10:13.032 --> 10:22.533
I went ahead. It took anything, even for, I mean, I 
had a rough go of it, but I have no complaint. It was

10:27.504 --> 10:28.105
worth it. Did you know of the artists before you 
arrived in Dallas? I knew Guy Cahoon. There were

10:33.762 --> 10:34.544
quite a few. He was the most reputable one in 
Dallas. And I said, I'm going to aspire to get under

10:37.750 --> 10:40.977
Cahoon. But I started to have a doctor off. And 
finally I went to see Guy Cahoon, and he looked at me

10:43.682 --> 10:48.652
and said, well, I'm not ready for it yet, but I will. 
And I kept on, but I did. I took Cahoon's ads out of

10:50.326 --> 10:52.309
the paper. He had a distinctive style in pen and ink 
work. He did almost all the ads, real estate firms,

10:54.832 --> 10:57.796
and he was an architect. And an architectural 
delineator, which makes it perspective. And

11:01.240 --> 11:02.401
there's my man. So I started in with him, and he 
finally took me on. I said, I'll give you a try. And

11:06.206 --> 11:07.268
all of a sudden, he said, my God. I picked up his 
technique and everything else. And his style, he

11:10.452 --> 11:13.275
just said, I've been looking for him. So I went to 
work at $120 a week for him. And what I did, Patrick,

11:17.765 --> 11:20.388
all of his work, I would say. When was this, do you 
suppose? I was in, I think it was 24 or something

11:23.052 --> 11:26.997
like that. Then I finally, I just had enough of a guy 
came home, and he just, I pushed more and more off of

11:27.017 --> 11:32.204
him. He just took off and made a tremendous lot of 
money. So I was doing these delineations that I

11:35.248 --> 11:41.576
told you of architectural buildings, 
perspectives. And I went to show that to this

11:41.596 --> 11:45.221
architectural friend of Thompson and Swain. I 
said, I'm going to shoot to go for the highest. And

11:47.178 --> 11:51.983
they were the most reputable architects in 
Dallas, residents, essentially residential.

11:52.003 --> 12:00.272
They did the Highland Park home, so I showed my 
things to Mr. Swain, and they said, my God, we could

11:52.003 --> 12:00.272
use you in perspective ways. Interior and 
everything else, I went to work and did

12:00.633 --> 12:09.302
perspectives, and I did study design under him, 
but it was nice, because I had a wonderful man I

12:00.633 --> 12:09.302
worked on. Anyhow, I finally got a little bit tired 
of that, said, I'm going to my, see if I can go on my

12:09.322 --> 12:17.151
own. But I had innumerable perspectives, 
interiors and exteriors, for all the residential

12:17.587 --> 12:25.258
and building. Then some Houston architects came 
down, found out about me, and they said, come on to

12:26.180 --> 12:30.386
Houston. It's wide open for an architectural 
delineator like yourself. And so about 10 or 15 of

12:34.332 --> 12:36.315
them got me down there. And I had a good go of it. I 
went to Houston. Incidentally, that's when I

12:38.558 --> 12:40.100
married my wife. So I met her in Devone Reynolds. 
She was in the art department. They're handling

12:43.726 --> 12:46.530
the art supplies. And she was essentially a very 
good artist in her own right. So we went to night

12:48.948 --> 12:54.015
school at Bryan High, and then we finally decided 
we'd all team up and get married. Now, this is in

12:55.337 --> 12:56.619
Dallas? It was Dallas where this happened, yes. It 
was in Dallas. But you went to night school in

12:59.564 --> 13:01.967
Dallas at Bryan High? Uh-huh, at Bryan. There was 
an art course there, a very fine one, under a man who

13:02.608 --> 13:08.076
did the posters for Majestic Taylor. But I learned 
a lot from him. Now, of course, I continued with my

13:10.680 --> 13:14.425
wife, and she stayed on. That's what made up our 
move to go to Houston. and went down there and had a

13:17.290 --> 13:19.773
rather nice school over there. It wasn't, but I 
learned. Every time I was learning, I'd get in new

13:23.918 --> 13:31.287
places, picking up new styles, new approaches, 
everything, but I was out to learn. What year did

13:32.429 --> 13:34.712
you start in A&M then? I started in 17. In 17. When 
did you graduate from high school? 17. I thought

13:39.758 --> 13:42.882
you went to the Army someplace between A&M and A&M. 
I went in 18, yeah. Okay. I went in 18. I had to make a

13:47.513 --> 13:48.814
change. They had, but they instigated the SATC, 
the Student's Army Training Corps, and we had it

13:48.834 --> 13:53.680
here. It was on me, so I joined up here. Had to be 
drafted. And of course, went to, but we still had a

13:59.466 --> 14:06.013
course, but it was essentially a military. But you 
were stationed here then on the campus itself.

14:08.395 --> 14:09.957
Then I had a decision to make. I went to, oh, they had 
different branches, truck driving, what you call

14:10.037 --> 14:17.385
it, or aviation, so I decided to go to aviation when 
the time came to. I said, focus on one thing, which I

14:18.007 --> 14:22.033
did. I passed the test. I don't know how it ended. So 
I was supposed to go to Kelly Field and go to ground

14:24.416 --> 14:27.981
school there. And then almost to the side, it was 
out. Of course, I said, well, God, why didn't I? I

14:31.446 --> 14:33.729
should have at least got a chance to fly. I'll go 
over there and get battered and run

14:33.749 --> 14:36.893
wrist-pulling. I said, fuck it. But, yeah, of 
course, almost to the side. And I went back there,

14:42.261 --> 14:46.647
and I started all over again. But I had a good go at 
A&M when I went to architecture because I did about

14:47.335 --> 14:53.112
four years of work in three years. But I was annual. 
Tammy was annual. Where did you hear the Chicago

14:58.642 --> 15:01.005
Institute of Art? What interested you in that? 
Well, I just, now and then I run across work. I see

15:05.191 --> 15:06.673
the ads. But I had no, no one from Cuero had ever gone 
to the Institute. There was a lot of

15:09.797 --> 15:12.401
correspondence courses. But I was told that was 
the logic of some of the artists. I mean, I don't

15:15.085 --> 15:20.492
know how in the world, but I knew that was the place 
at the time. But I'm actually, I'm glad I didn't do

15:22.034 --> 15:24.177
it. I tell you why, because if I'd have gone to that 
particular school, like all others, it would have

15:25.102 --> 15:32.752
been figure drawing, advertising, the same 
routine all of them goes through. But then I got to

15:32.772 --> 15:36.638
architecture when I learned about buildings. I 
worked on the structure. I know what held the

15:38.600 --> 15:43.327
building together, but I learned the essentials 
of architecture. And that's what stood me

15:44.008 --> 15:46.531
instead, because then I devoted to that. And I had a 
field of my own. Nobody else was there. Only two men

15:48.994 --> 15:50.476
in Texas were doing it. It was Cahoon and myself 
later. But it opened a new door for me. Then I went to

15:56.152 --> 16:00.838
New York, and my wife said, no, you've had enough of 
this. Let's go on to New York, the headquarters,

16:00.858 --> 16:04.103
big time. So we packed up. Now, this is not when you 
leave Dallas. No, that's when I left Houston. How

16:08.529 --> 16:09.470
long were you in Houston? Oh, let's see, from 26 to 
20, I think, 28 years, two years in Houston. Then

16:16.579 --> 16:18.622
you just freelanced in Houston? I freelanced. got 
a nice account from Anderson Clayton, an

16:19.574 --> 16:26.446
advertising program, 52 drawings for them, but 
that was essentially illustration too. And uh...

16:27.288 --> 16:31.315
Well that's not when you did the Anderson Clayton 
Cotton Series, is it? I did a Cotton Series, no, and

16:31.375 --> 16:36.865
uh, it was a fifth ad, oh I still had them here, 52. It 
went, it ran in the Wall Street, 52 ads for Anderson

16:36.925 --> 16:41.654
Clayton, a whole year. And it was a, it was a, great 
thing for me because I learned about mobile

16:44.482 --> 16:49.872
drawing and about the industry itself, which 
stood me in good stead. And I took on some other, a

16:50.894 --> 16:54.360
little more architecture stuff. I got to build up a 
slight stockpile. I bought us a new car and went to

16:56.644 --> 16:59.549
New York. And that was something else too, going to 
New York in 1928. Actually,

17:07.313 --> 17:14.785
We were in dire circumstances financially, but we 
had to skimp and say, but keep the car and enough for

17:07.313 --> 17:14.785
gasoline and food. So we actually ended up staying 
on the filling station cannabis going up to New

17:14.805 --> 17:20.434
York, selecting the car. And I remember one 
incident, I might just bring it in, but we got, I

17:22.156 --> 17:28.967
think it was Wheeling, West Virginia, a big mining 
town. And we got there way late. Horrible fog, you

17:31.875 --> 17:34.197
know, it was dismal. And it just, it just made me... 
So we got onto the Philly station, went to sleep

17:36.320 --> 17:40.964
under there, and the police picked us up. They 
didn't take... I saw this text saying, what are you

17:42.426 --> 17:44.448
talking about? God, don't you know any better than 
to do this? Mining town, you could have gotten

17:46.330 --> 17:48.793
murdered or raped your wife. So they'd come with 
us. So they took me to the police, took us to the

17:50.254 --> 17:56.280
police station, and took us upstairs and gave us 
some cots to sleep on that night. Next week they

17:57.421 --> 17:58.903
sent us on our way. But I always had a lot of trouble 
with police force in the East. I got on one-way

18:03.838 --> 18:08.705
streets in New Jersey and I got messed up and cussed 
out being a dumb Texan. But it was, everything, to

18:09.346 --> 18:14.414
my mind, it was an exhilarating experience. But it 
was fun. I took it in that life. Everything happens

18:17.218 --> 18:18.620
to me, always. But the attitude of my wife, she was 
very good in H.H. Buffett. But we made it to New

18:22.006 --> 18:23.608
York. And finally, I took about two weeks to get up 
there, leisurely at the same time. That was an

18:33.884 --> 18:38.550
awesome feeling when you got over to New Jersey and 
got to the Dykeman Fair. I never forget that. I

18:39.171 --> 18:41.714
looked over at that fantastic skyline. This is 
the, oh my God, we're going to barge into the same It

18:44.294 --> 18:45.736
just looked like they were going to engulf us. I 
said, well, let's get with it. So we crossed it.

18:47.699 --> 18:49.221
There was no place to stay. And somebody told us 
about a spot on a Boston Post road or what. We saw

18:53.968 --> 18:58.735
that in Washington, in one of the motels where we 
had stayed one night. We went up there and drove

18:58.755 --> 19:01.579
that road. We thought, oh, thank god. We're going 
to find a spot to spend the night. Then we went into

19:03.862 --> 19:04.963
this place. I have never seen anything as filthy 
and dirty as that place was. So they took us there.

19:11.032 --> 19:12.394
They had wood stoves. And just nothing worked, but 
we spent one night that we could, and then we drove

19:12.779 --> 19:18.327
on back to New York. And we called the last resort, 
we called a relative of River Lee's. He was on the

19:24.696 --> 19:27.620
Fawcett publication, George Bond. I remember 
that very well. So they said, come on over to 108th

19:29.543 --> 19:35.852
Street, where we stay in between Broadway and 
Riverside Drive and have an apartment. So we drove

19:35.872 --> 19:40.098
back up there and then went to see the Bonds. And 
they... I said, God, this is terrible what's

19:42.074 --> 19:44.997
happening to you all. It shouldn't happen. You can 
do... Let's see, I believe there's a vacancy

19:45.977 --> 19:50.341
across the street from 108th. Number 108th on a big 
five-story apartment kind of like a townhouse.

19:57.308 --> 19:58.609
And we went over there to see that. And showed up 
some gracious people there. And I was a mason. I had

20:01.892 --> 20:03.493
a Masonic pen on that time. He said, my God, a fellow 
mason. He's a wonderful person. He says, come

20:06.416 --> 20:07.216
here. The fifth floor is vacant. Went up there and 
it was Victor Herbert's. His composing room was

20:11.707 --> 20:14.510
called Corkman. Said, this is yours. He wanted it 
for $50 a month. It was just a room and a kitchen and a

20:17.233 --> 20:19.516
band. So that's where we stayed. And set our sales 
up, I say, because then the real worry started.

20:25.843 --> 20:27.204
There was no money, so we had to go around. Just 
pound the pavements. Catch a C-Tech one side of the

20:28.505 --> 20:30.388
street. Go see all the advertising points and 
architects and magazines. And nothing happened

20:36.895 --> 20:39.958
until I pulled this little funny story. trip of 
mine, everybody knows about

20:40.327 --> 20:47.359
it. That's what you call a chilly episode. So I 
decided I had to do something. You couldn't get

20:53.310 --> 20:54.232
where they ought. I showed them my things, and they 
said, oh, this is wonderful. But nope, I got no

20:56.435 --> 20:59.220
acceptance. I think it was just because the market 
was pretty crowded. But anyhow, I said, I'm going

21:02.326 --> 21:03.909
to do something. So I got me some Gephardt's chili. 
in a stainless can heater and I had this old greasy

21:06.061 --> 21:09.506
Stetson hat of mine. I put it on and I burned some 
holes in it like bullet holes. Then I went up to see a

21:12.410 --> 21:18.398
magazine called Pencil Points. The editor was Ken 
Reed. And I went to, he came, I came in there and he

21:20.801 --> 21:24.126
said, well, God, where you from? I said, Texas. 
Well, where'd you get the bullet holes? Oh, I don't

21:26.028 --> 21:26.469
know. We had a little run-in down at the bar. I was 
working with some, any kind of story. Then I told

21:33.759 --> 21:34.600
him, And we sat around. He got interested. Boy, he 
was a terrific person. God, understanding. And he

21:41.271 --> 21:44.134
looked at my work, and he says, my God, you've got 
something here. I didn't know anybody from Texas

21:44.154 --> 21:46.617
ever did this type of thing. Pencil drawings, I've 
been doing all that time. From Washington, we'd

21:49.279 --> 21:52.242
watch all the Carolinas. But I had a great sheaf of 
just sketching, sketching. And he said, well, now

21:55.705 --> 21:57.747
it's time for lunch. Why about us going out 
somewhere? I want to give you a nice lunch. And I

22:02.457 --> 22:04.982
says, well, I don't know, but I'm kind of used to 
eating. I would have been eating down on the Texas

22:05.002 --> 22:11.196
way now, but I have my own brand of vittles, of 
course. I've got some with me, I believe. Chili, I

22:12.819 --> 22:13.881
always carry with me. I got to stay in the heater. 
Whenever I can, my wife would stop in the park, just

22:14.723 --> 22:18.171
heat up and eat chili. Oh, you're talking about 
now, isn't that some damn good thing? And I went

22:21.813 --> 22:25.179
back to the shipping room with them and said, can I 
have a place? So they all gathered around. I hit my

22:26.261 --> 22:30.669
stand here and I opened that can of chili and poured 
it down there. And they went, ah, let's get one more

22:30.689 --> 22:31.971
pepper. And I believe it. Well, it's hot enough, 
yeah. So we got some paper bowls and plates,

22:34.215 --> 22:36.198
whatever. I carried those with me, too. And I 
concocted my chili. I started eating it. I said,

22:40.666 --> 22:41.568
you want to try it? They said, oh, come on, try it. I 
said, no, Tony, you got to adjust it, Tony. She

22:46.156 --> 22:46.757
said, man, we got to. We got cast out of 
Stomachstown, Texas. So I went there, and I was the

22:49.980 --> 22:52.084
first one. Then they just hooped and hollered at me 
and said, bye, golly, you come on. So he took me out

22:55.250 --> 22:58.015
to his house, his editor, a pleasant one. He went 
and had a bridge digested and printed out there and

22:58.035 --> 23:02.704
got my story. And he ran this beautiful story on me, 
the pencil boy. And it opened the door, and it came

23:06.564 --> 23:09.048
out to architects. I got calls from some of the top 
men, but I said, I'm going to get... So that's when I

23:13.997 --> 23:18.544
started studying under the top delineators 
called pencil artists in New York. And they were

23:19.325 --> 23:26.397
beautiful to me when they went to me, because I was 
more or less an eccentric, whatever you want to

23:19.325 --> 23:26.397
call it, silly, crazy Texan. But I had to just 
always elaborate on everything in real Texas. I

23:30.893 --> 23:32.254
just went after it. I had some old scrubby boots. 
But I've got House Beautiful took me on, Pictorial

23:35.839 --> 23:40.686
Review, all these old magazines. But everything 
just fell into place beautifully after that. And I

23:43.530 --> 23:48.537
went off and started teaching up at New York 
University. And I don't know, I delivered. said,

23:50.592 --> 23:53.157
we got a depression around the corner. That's just 
before the depression. He said, it'd be better if

23:54.460 --> 23:56.804
you all went on back to Texas. That's what Ken Reed 
told me. That man was so good to me. Am I talking loud

24:00.311 --> 24:01.413
enough now? Yeah, it's going fine. All right. And 
so then we got a call from Paul Franke. He was up here

24:07.084 --> 24:08.387
at the time. He was a cadet colonel and a big shot in 
the I started an advertising agency. There was

24:12.715 --> 24:13.577
just two of them. He got a mentor, and they were 
handling the Anderson Clayton account. They had

24:18.143 --> 24:21.969
gotten on the road with it, and then they said, by 
golly, we need an auditor. And of course, they were

24:23.171 --> 24:29.700
very close to me, because he's the one that put me on 
this first 52 series for Anderson Clayton. So I

24:30.582 --> 24:33.626
said, oh, I want to go home with my wife. I want to see 
my family, my brothers. And we were put alone, just

24:35.449 --> 24:37.492
down to Nubbin. I'd run through everything. My car 
wasn't hot. I couldn't get a dollar. I had $20 a

24:42.640 --> 24:45.283
month extra for my car. But I picked up enough money 
to get on the road again. So we decided, let's go.

24:48.827 --> 24:52.031
Packed up and just like that, we crossed the river 
and started down. And how we got to Houston, buddy,

24:52.051 --> 24:57.357
I think we came to Houston with 30 cents in our 
pocket. But then I went on to see Frankie. And he

25:00.120 --> 25:02.983
said, we can set up for you at the Cotton Exchange 
building. Come on. I'd stay with us a while. And

25:04.425 --> 25:05.066
we'd go on the motor. So I went and looked it over. 
And I had some work for me to do. And here I go on this.

25:11.845 --> 25:16.129
New Venture, a third partner in the advertising 
firm. And things worked. It was a good deal. And I

25:17.731 --> 25:20.814
got to still do my architectural work and was a 
partner in the firm. And I always stayed in a

25:22.175 --> 25:25.878
horrible place, but just like you were. So things 
got right. But I don't know, from then on, it just

25:28.241 --> 25:33.906
seemed like it was rather, we didn't have any work, 
you know. We had just a handful of accounts. But we

25:35.848 --> 25:38.551
finally picked up another here and there, just a 
little. Finally got the umbilical cord. And that

25:39.732 --> 25:40.392
was it. The ultimate. We worked at that big oil car. 
It was handled by a New York firm at that time. So we

25:48.365 --> 25:52.737
got hit and then we were well on the road then. I 
handled all the advertising. I mean, the layouts

25:55.423 --> 25:57.526
and the finished art. It was a work out, and we 
picked them. Finally, I ended up with about 20

25:59.288 --> 26:00.970
accounts. This is in 1930? This was in 1928 when I 
came in. 1929, and stayed there. In 30, we got on the

26:08.778 --> 26:10.620
road in the big way. But that was the fall of 1929 
when I came in. Of course, the bottom did drop. The

26:14.505 --> 26:15.566
depression came. Everybody, all my friends, just 
completely wiped out. That's what it is. But we had

26:20.572 --> 26:22.774
this forewarning about it. But from then on, of 
course, I got more involved in the Houston scene

26:23.210 --> 26:32.278
and working with art to find the fine arts in the 
museums. But it was a haphazard type of thing, I

26:32.338 --> 26:37.542
guess. What do you call it? All the time, I was out 
jumping around trying to find answers. But that's

26:44.188 --> 26:50.534
when the firm opened up there with Frankie and 
Wilkerson. I stayed with them from then on out. But

26:52.471 --> 26:54.194
it was a hard game, too. We finally got more 
accounts. We got bigger and bigger. We kind of

26:56.677 --> 26:59.301
ended up as second biggest agency in the state of 
Texas. But it was a workout. I didn't know

27:04.289 --> 27:05.671
advertising could be that hard. Because I was art 
director, I had to get to lay outside and consume

27:05.691 --> 27:09.577
ideas. Creativity, deadlines, deadlines, 
deadlines. And that brought on some problems. We

27:14.044 --> 27:14.825
all started that. But advertising is a killer. You 
know, mortality rate in advertising I don't know

27:19.133 --> 27:20.975
whether I should be putting this in there. Sure, go 
ahead. As far as alcoholics are concerned, it's

27:22.297 --> 27:28.785
the highest of any profession, because for that 
reason, that is creativity and deadlines. And he

27:28.905 --> 27:31.468
just had to strain and strain to get something out. 
He said, oh, yeah, we get on the road with a good cut.

27:35.032 --> 27:35.553
I call it cut. But every one of us got pretty much a 
job, and so did our accounts. And that went on for a

27:40.318 --> 27:41.380
while. It finally leveled off. But it was a 
hazardous experience.

27:48.783 --> 27:50.465
out of the West. I stayed with the agency, of 
course. Then I got more into fine arts and

27:52.207 --> 27:53.909
painting. I started submitting things to shows 
and museums and shows over the United States. And

27:58.974 --> 28:00.636
I've got some pretty good goals over there. I've 
got an international watercolor show. I've got an

28:02.578 --> 28:05.181
international and a national show. And I finally 
got more and more absorbed with my painting, back

28:06.102 --> 28:10.547
to the painting. So I started going down to 
Galveston. Every spare minute I had was doing

28:12.389 --> 28:14.672
watercolors in Galveston. I thought I'd made one 
sum about 50, 60 watercolors, and started putting

28:15.108 --> 28:30.531
them in shows, and got an entree in that area,

28:15.108 --> 28:30.531
which I had aspired to. But I didn't look for 
competition. I just wanted my thing to be seen. I

28:33.996 --> 28:40.506
only got, I think, $25 or $35 for a watercolor then, 
and $10, $15 for a pencil drawing. Of course, at the

28:40.967 --> 28:43.731
moment, I'm just going to think, I'm just going, 
Not sky high, but kind of another plateau. But that

28:48.287 --> 28:49.389
was only the beginning. But see, all those things, 
you just trace back your career. You get going

28:54.255 --> 28:59.503
beautifully, and then wham, comes the roadblock, 
and you get struck down. One thing after another,

28:59.583 --> 29:01.105
it seemed like. But it was part of it. I mean, that's 
why I like that verse. I don't know why, but some of

29:05.892 --> 29:06.933
it. It kind of shook you. You get to so darn 
complacent, and you get a few plaudits in the

29:08.455 --> 29:12.621
crowd, and nice reviews, and... critics from the 
paper and say, oh, this is dandy. And you get a

29:16.067 --> 29:18.836
little bit of reticence to work with them. But, ah, 
well as seen, oh.
