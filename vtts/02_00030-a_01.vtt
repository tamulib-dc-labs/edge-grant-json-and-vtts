In the kitchen on 806 Thomas Street with Mr. and Mrs. Brazil. Now you say something. That is correct. Okay. First, Mr. Brazil, would you, for the sake of someone in the future who might not know either of us and know about your background, would you summarize your growing up years and your background and your family, where and so forth, before you came to Texas A&M?

00:32.515 --> 00:59.752
I was born and raised in Houston County, the county seats Crockett, and went to a rural school ten years and went to Crockett High School two years. And in view of the athletic situation, I'm glad I went to the high school in Crockett

00:59.752 --> 01:22.330
because it gave me a better opportunity to walk on here as an athlete. And there was very few paved roads, and it was difficult to get to school. In fact, part of the time when the roads were not too bad,

01:22.651 --> 01:51.963
school about ten miles away in a 1924 Model T when there was only seven miles of pavement in Houston County. What did your family do for a living? They were farmers and ranchers. What was the cash crop? Cotton and a little extra corn that the mules didn't eat. And how many in your senior class at Crockett High School?

01:52.469 --> 02:20.819
I believe thirty-one. Do you have any idea how many of them went to college? I would just roughly guess half of them would be my guess. Why did you come to A&M instead of going to some other place? Well, that's an interesting story. My senior year, I don't know whether the basketball season was over or it was before the season,

02:22.388 --> 02:31.045
Anyway, I was done pretty well, was captain of the team, and I had a brother in the class of 30.

02:32.395 --> 02:59.750
And he's now deceased. He lived only nine years. He was at A&M as a senior, lived in the shacks down behind Law Hall. And he said, Arkansas is coming to town to play two games, Monday and Tuesday night, and I think you ought to see them. It'd be good for you.

03:00.340 --> 03:22.480
Well, up to that point, I'd never missed a day in school alive. So he hadn't get special permission from my parents to miss school the first time. So I got somebody to carry me to Palestine in the mud by the way of Slocum because the road was blocked to get there otherwise and caught a train.

03:22.480 --> 03:37.060
come to Hearn. And the delay was in Palestine, and they got to Hearn. The other train was gone. But there's three or four boys on the train from Palestine. One of them was

03:37.313 --> 03:58.863
in my brother's class, and we got acquainted. He said, the college station train will be gone when we get there, but we'll get you to the campus. So we walked through about a mile of construction work and got out on the highway. We took the order in which who had the earliest classes

03:58.863 --> 04:26.386
to hitchhike a ride, and everybody got to campus by eight o'clock. And he wanted me to see the Arkansas series, which I did. Now, this is basketball? Basketball. In those days, they played two games every other year rather than home and home in a year. And he didn't even go with me because it was pouring down rain.

04:26.386 --> 04:54.449
to go from the Shacks to the G. Raleigh White D-wear. So they dressed me up in an old campaign hat and a slicker. Everybody had insignias and three things painted on the back of these old slickers. And they sent me on to the game. And it was not very cold.

04:55.883 --> 05:23.710
They said, why don't you go barefooted? So I went across now Simpson Drill Field barefooted and got to the game with somebody else's coupon book and the OD on the gate said, you can't come in here barefooted. And so I got him off the side and told him what my situation was and he said, well, wait till the traffic gets a little lighter.

05:23.710 --> 05:51.841
and you come on to the door and I'll pass you in. So that was a really interesting experience of that night. But seeing the campus during the day while he was in class, and about a third of that was sent in the veterinary medicine display of old Dr. Francis, I decided I should be over here too.

05:53.343 --> 06:15.601
So, he graduated in 30 and I come in 31, September 31. Was that your only visit to the campus before coming to enroll? No, in 1927 I had a bachelor cousin who had tickets for the Thanksgiving game.

06:15.601 --> 06:38.213
And he had a date. He was never married. He had a date and had a third ticket, and my brother had gotten for him. And he said, I want you to ride College Station with me to the football game. So I come to see the Thanksgiving game in 1927 with them, and I still have my ticket untorn.

06:38.213 --> 07:06.850
And don't ask too many questions about how I got in without tearing my ticket. And that was my first trip. It was during Joel Hunt and Herschel Burgess's day. And so that was my first trip, and this week's visit was my second trip. And I thought, well, if it was good enough for him, it's good enough for me. All right, then when you come to enroll? When?

07:07.087 --> 07:34.323
Well, describe that also. When was it? Describe that trip. I would say about mid-December, September 1931. I came to school alone in the same 1924 Model T Ford out of Houston County to get to Madison County, which is now Highway 21, across the river on a ferry boat.

07:36.078 --> 07:48.110
The Navasota? No, the Trinity. Oh, the Trinity, yes. The Trinity River, and come on over and they said, you can't have a car. I said,

07:48.447 --> 08:11.077
what are you going to do with it?" And there was a Houston County clubhouse that Dr. Dan Russell started down about the Boyette community, and they said, you can leave your car down here, and we won't know who it belonged to. So I left my car there, and I think I carried it home Thanksgiving and left it.

08:11.077 --> 08:19.430
But that's the way I got here, and I joined the Company G infantry.

08:21.202 --> 08:47.628
Only for one reason, there was two or three seniors and one junior from Crockett in Company G, and so they hung around the rotunda of the academic building during the restoration. When it comes to the ROCC assignment, they stepped up to the sergeant's desk and said, we'd like to have this young fella in Company G infantry.

08:47.628 --> 09:15.438
And that's the way I got in Company G infantry, and I thought it was a good outfit. My senior year, when I was a freshman, Tiger Teague was our company commander. He was company commander when you were a senior? No, when I was a freshman. When you were a freshman. Oh, really? Well, now let's sidetrack on him. Describe Tiger Teague as a student. Well, him being a senior and I being a freshman,

09:17.277 --> 09:27.217
He graduated on time, I think, maybe one extra semester, because he worked part-time in the postal system as a mail sorter.

09:28.246 --> 09:57.642
On the campus or at the Northgate Post Office? No, the Northgate Post Office wasn't there. It was a little old building down close to where the Grove is now. Small building where they handled all the mail. But that was a federal post office. Yeah, a federal post office. And he sorted mail every night till about 1030. And he'd walk across the drill field from his post office job to his dormitory, which was Brazil.

09:59.296 --> 10:17.065
I was in room 105 as well, first and next to the entrance on the bottom floor, west side. Crossing that drill field, he could observe half of his unit, whether they were studying or not. What kind of a CO was he?

10:17.268 --> 10:39.492
He was a great CO. He had everybody's interest at heart and saw that you had study time undisturbed. But if you were not taking advantage of his study time when he was walking across the drill field, he had a private session with you later. Don't I remember him as not very tall?

10:39.695 --> 11:09.040
No, he wasn't very tall, but one of the best softball pitchers the world has ever known. Really? He softball pitcher when he was in the legislature with an artificial foot, and he lost one of his ankles in the World War II. And that was mended, and he had a short shoe and a sharp corner on the bottom so he could walk, but he still pitched baseball.

11:09.040 --> 11:31.130
And his legislative team won with him as a pitcher. But he was a good commander, and there was three other seniors in the outfit from Crockett. So I had a good tie there, and they helped me a lot. Let's see. Oh, when you came to enroll, what did you bring with you?

11:31.552 --> 11:55.801
in terms of clothing and anything else? I don't remember exactly what I brought, but they gave us a list of what to bring, and it wasn't much more than they needed because you wore your uniform all the time. There was no time you could be without your uniform on certain occasions, any class or all classes as it is now. Where did you get the money

11:56.611 --> 12:20.000
to pay for that first year? My parents had set aside that for me, and since my brother enjoyed it so much and graduated, they were well pleased. They did not have a big operation, but they provided enough for my older brother and my younger sister to get a college education.

12:20.422 --> 12:49.885
Did it seem to you that you had a choice about whether you would go to college or did your parents, were they determined you were going to go? No, I think they strictly left it up to me because I had to make the choice. Do you remember what that first year cost? No, but it was very little compared to what it was now. I worked in the dining hall of Sabisa as a student waiter my last three years. But not the first year?

12:50.257 --> 13:10.186
No, not the first year, and that come about because of the generosity of Coach Frank Anderson, the track coach, in the intramural track meet in the spring. I won three events, the high hurdles, the low hurdles, and the high jump.

13:11.148 --> 13:27.027
And about a week later, I ran into Colonel Anderson on the campus, and he said, I observed your intramural track meet, and I'd like for you to finish out the rest of the track season with the freshman track team.

13:27.500 --> 13:52.829
they did not go anywhere and compete with anybody. It was all called telegraphic. And they'd run against Tarleton and Arlington and through a few other junior colleges and then compare their results by telephone or wire. And so I went out and

13:53.133 --> 14:20.909
He had more good hurdlers than he needed, so he concentrated me on high jump. And I had an old system that most rural kids had. They called it a scissor. And he said, if you'll let me, I'll improve you from now to next year nearly a foot. And I said, well, I'm in favor of that. When do we start? And so I made letters and track.

14:21.550 --> 14:38.324
and he got the dining hall job for me, and that paid just for your meals. Just for your meals. They paid you, but you paid for your meals. And it was a break-even? Break-even for your board.

14:38.577 --> 15:08.547
And you did that your... Just sophomore, junior, and senior year. All right. Let's stay back with this freshman year. When you got here, describe the major buildings on the campus. What was here in 1931? Well, the most important one was Brazell Hall. And sophomore year, I went to Hart. Junior year, I went to Leggett. And senior year, I went to Foster.

15:09.087 --> 15:31.784
and faucets had been removed, and the lake had been removed, and the old academic building, as we call it now, was most of the classrooms. The military science had a few outside classrooms, but the campus was very small. They had the Aggieland Inn at the north gate across the street from Sivisa Hall.

15:32.425 --> 15:56.135
And there was no dormitories in that area at all, and a few businesses at the north gate. I don't remember how many. Was Guyon Hall the south end of the buildings? Guyon Hall was the south end of what we called Military Wall. And there was nothing beyond it except faculty and staff houses?

15:56.962 --> 16:10.951
beyond that. For every formation, three times a day, every cadet outfit formed on military walks and walked to the dining hall for meals.

16:11.913 --> 16:31.792
in a very short, quick order because they entered sometime in three different entrances to get to the dining hall and everything in the way of salads and drinking water and some of the

16:31.792 --> 16:55.214
items were already on the table, and when the troops got to the table, then the waiter provided the rest of it. And that was much easier for me in my last two years because the supervision of Sabisa Hall at that time

16:55.214 --> 17:18.535
was a retired World One Army sergeant named King. It was about, even with my shoulder was his height, but he was a good one. He said, since you're an athlete and you eat on a training table, we gonna let you have that as your responsibility. So the last two years,

17:18.535 --> 17:47.223
All I had to do was go and get the necessary plates for the number of athletes I had, and their people had water and a lot of stuff already on the table. One interesting item there, I believe it was my senior year, the basketball squad had only sixteen people on it, including the managers and the trainers.

17:48.337 --> 17:59.035
And I could carry a tray with four prepared plates on the tray. Four, eight, or twelve. And to keep making two trips of eight,

17:59.913 --> 18:27.166
I told them to put all eight of them, all 16 of them on one tray, four high and four around. And I just made one trip back to the main dining hall. And I noticed Sergeant King kept eyeing me pretty close. So I knew him pretty well. So one day I visited with him.

18:28.111 --> 18:46.977
I said, Sergeant King, have I been doing something wrong? I said, you spent a lot of your time watching me. He says, well, you're not doing anything wrong, but I want to see you when you drop that first 16 plates. Did you ever drop it? No.

18:46.977 --> 19:16.357
I made sure I didn't. But I could go there, and at the same time the athletes did, and it was a good assignment. So I owe a lot to Colonel Landy. Describe what it was like to be a fish in 1931. Well, you'd think if you ended about a week or a month, there wasn't anybody on the campus but fish, because they did everything.

19:17.808 --> 19:46.276
the upperclassmen would stick their head out of the door and all the freshmen. And the last one that got to his door ran the errand. If it was twenty freshmen, the first nineteen were excused, and whether it was go to the post office or go get cleaning or whatever was necessary. And we had one freshman per upperclassmen room to put it in order.

19:46.276 --> 20:14.828
And it seemed like a very tremendous chore and an unfair thing your first year, but after your first year you felt like you had earned your apprenticeship. So I'm sure there's nothing like that now. What was a normal class day like? When did it begin and what happened during that? Eight to twelve and one to five, there was no... But what time did you get up?

20:16.060 --> 20:41.103
I don't remember, probably about six, I believe we formed to go to the morning formation in time to get to the dining hall by seven so everybody could get to class. But there was no night classes, there was no noon classes because they had plenty of room, twenty of classroom space.

20:41.525 --> 21:03.968
Let's make believe that during that day you had an hour that was unscheduled. You had free time. Where could a fish spend any free time? He better be in his room studying. It's a place for him. He can get an excuse maybe to go to the library to study, but you had to put a note on your door.

21:04.272 --> 21:29.737
telling you what part of the library you'll be in, because they wanted you to take full advantage of your study time. In fact, I lived as a junior in Mitchell Hall with a boy that was a sophomore. His dad was a senator, Texas senator, Nat Patton. And he wasn't too good a student, and they asked me if I would room with him.

21:30.310 --> 21:56.500
And I said, yes, if it'll help. And he said, well, if you can get him to go to class and make him study, you'll have done a good chore. So Annette Patton and I roomed together when he was a sophomore and I was a junior. And it was well worth my effort, because he graduated.

21:57.057 --> 22:26.656
Do you remember anything that today we would call hazing that occurred during your fresh year? Yes, it was hazing, day and night. Can you give some examples? Well, I don't guess they can go back and prosecute anybody. I don't think so. But the board, or paddle as they call it, the board was a ruling instrument.

22:28.732 --> 22:58.111
whether you were a good freshman or a bad freshman, or a good sophomore or a bad sophomore. They were not above the board, too. And a lot of people went home because of that aspect of it. I don't know what our percentage was, but those that stayed were glad they stayed. But it was a real rampage.

22:58.448 --> 23:28.435
Now where would the paddling occur? In the hallway? In the hallway, in the hallway. Very few night sergeants would ever intercede or break it up because they knew it was a common practice. Can you give any examples of what we today might label good bull? Surely you freshmen must have played some tricks on some upperclassmen

23:28.790 --> 23:57.680
Only one time a year. What was that? On what we called Fish Day in the spring. Fish were sophomores, and sophomores were fish. And that was an all-day fun thing, and sometimes you come out worse than you went in. But it was a fun day for everybody, and they all looked forward to it. Were there drownouts in those days? Yes.

23:58.827 --> 24:28.274
What kind of bomb? BABO. No, I think water is the only thing I recall and it was somebody that was goofing off or they didn't like or for some reason like that and nobody was barred from from that regardless of class. Now during your fish year you were not working in the dining hall so you ate with your outfit

24:28.882 --> 24:40.947
Describe the dining hall routine for a freshman. Everybody went in together and had campaign hats.

24:42.044 --> 25:09.922
wooden chairs so your hat could go under the chair, and everybody was seated about the same time. The food dishes were passed to all the upperclassmen, and it was usually not necessary for seconds to get the first serving all the way around.

25:10.985 --> 25:40.229
I do not recall any harassment at all while you were eating. It was custom in those days that you could not have your pie, it was known as kush of course, you could not have your pie for 35 days. My class was 35. For 35 days you could have all the pie you wanted, but you had to eat it under the table. For the first 35 days? For the first.

25:40.600 --> 26:07.668
For the first 35 days. Now, had you gotten that report yet? No, I hadn't heard. That's a new one. So, I don't know how it went when the classes got to 50 and 60. Did you literally sit on the floor? Yeah, sit on the floor and sit. And hold your plate and eat? That's right. And the tables were made with three wooden boards and a cloth over it, but they were not waterproof.

26:08.393 --> 26:36.710
and it was a normal just a thing to pour water on the table once freshmen got under there to eat their pie but they could have all the pie they wanted go meal hound it get it from other tables and go under there and share share like with the number it was under there and the time we got through everybody's going to class but we had enough time to get to class now as you recall

26:37.267 --> 26:50.007
Did you always get as much to eat as you wanted? Yeah. Everybody gained weight. What were your favorite varieties of A&M dining hall food? What did you like best in the dining hall?

26:50.277 --> 27:18.053
Oh, I don't recall. All the meals were very nourishable, particularly when they had roast or steak or something like that and a couple of vegetables and a drink. So I don't remember. We ate what they put out, and everybody gained weight. Was there any food that you ate here for the first time, anything new? I don't think so.

27:18.458 --> 27:40.379
Because I'm assuming there wasn't any pizza and there wasn't any Mexican food and there wasn't any Chinese. No, no, that was before that time. And you might have had some fresh vegetables at home in the garden that you wouldn't get on the table, but it was a tremendous responsibility to feed them.

27:40.379 --> 28:10.147
Mr. Duncan lived across the hall, across the side street from the rear west corner of Sabeza Hall. There was a building there that the YMCA widow also lived in. Mrs. Cashin? Mrs. Cashin was there for quite some time. And they all lived over there, but the family came across the street and they ate in a special dining room of their own.

28:11.547 --> 28:38.648
and did it, I guess, 21 times a week if they wanted to eat. And you could not take food out of a dining hall. Did you students ever violate that rule? Yes, because we were responsible for the first revelry that ever came in the campus. One of our class members picked the dog up after being hit by a car.

28:39.307 --> 29:03.927
at what's now the East Gate. It was just a dirt road. They'd been to Houston and hitchhiking at home, and somebody had run over this dog, and she was in the ditch injured. So they brought her to the dormitory, and we had a couple of senior vet students, and they took care of the dog. How old was that dog then?

29:04.197 --> 29:33.458
I would say she's probably a year old, very young dog. They bandaged her leg and got her back to normal. Several classes still claim the first Reveille, but I know who the first Reveille is responsible for. She came same time we did, and only just a few weeks after we did. Describe her in terms of color and size.

29:33.914 --> 29:54.080
just about the exact image of the bronze statue in the Cadet Center, because that was taken from a picture, one of the first pictures ever made of her with a little blanket made for her purpose.

29:55.514 --> 30:07.883
And the four classes that were in school at the time she was here first wanted to make that monument to go in there.

30:10.465 --> 30:30.918
four, I believe. One class declined, so we got 36, 37, 38, and 39. Anyway, four classes together and put that thing together and took up a donation from class after we graduated, of course. And she was certainly not a purebred

30:31.255 --> 31:00.972
Oh, no. But the bronze image is very, very good of her because of the color of her feet, and the body features, and the way she held her tail. One ear was higher than the other, and the discoveries did a wonderful job. Did, when the dog was first in the dormitory, were there any times when

31:01.225 --> 31:22.606
Doug was almost forced out by his... No, not in the dormitory. There was a little problem in the dining hall until Sergeant King agreed that if everybody thought enough of her that she ought to eat in the dining hall, she'd come and go as she wished.
