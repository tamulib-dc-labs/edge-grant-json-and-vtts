00:02.427 --> 00:06.811
In the kitchen on 806 Thomas Street with Mr. and 
Mrs. Brazil. Now you say something. That is

00:09.454 --> 00:10.475
correct. Okay.

00:14.119 --> 00:30.375
First, Mr. Brazil, would you, for the sake of 
someone in the future who might not know either of

00:14.119 --> 00:30.375
us and know about your background, would you 
summarize your growing up years and your

00:14.119 --> 00:30.375
background and your family, where and so forth, 
before you came to Texas A&M? I was born and raised

00:32.515 --> 00:47.475
in Houston County, the county seats Crockett, and 
went to a rural school

00:32.515 --> 00:47.475
ten years and went to Crockett High School two 
years. And in view of the

00:49.118 --> 00:59.772
athletic situation, I'm glad I went to the high 
school in Crockett because it gave me a better

00:59.752 --> 01:06.704
opportunity to walk on here as an athlete. And 
there was very few paved roads, and it was

01:08.266 --> 01:17.061
difficult to get to school. In fact, part of the 
time when the roads were not too bad, school about

01:22.651 --> 01:34.564
ten miles away in a 1924 Model T when there was only 
seven miles of pavement in Houston County. What

01:35.245 --> 01:36.666
did your family do for a living? They were farmers 
and ranchers. What was the cash crop? Cotton and a

01:41.932 --> 01:48.479
little extra corn that the mules didn't eat. And 
how many in your senior class at Crockett High

01:48.499 --> 01:51.983
School? I believe thirty-one. Do you have any idea 
how many of them went to college? I would just

01:59.957 --> 02:04.622
roughly guess half of them would be my guess. Why 
did you come to A&M instead of going to some other

02:05.723 --> 02:10.268
place? Well, that's an interesting story. My 
senior year, I don't know whether the basketball

02:12.811 --> 02:20.839
season was over or it was before the season, 
Anyway, I was done pretty well, was captain of the

02:22.388 --> 02:31.065
team, and I had a brother in the class of 30. And he's 
now deceased. He lived only nine years. He was at

02:38.142 --> 02:45.652
A&M as a senior, lived in the shacks down behind Law 
Hall. And he said, Arkansas is coming to town to

02:46.874 --> 02:58.428
play two games, Monday and Tuesday night, and I 
think you ought to see them. It'd be good for you.

03:00.340 --> 03:04.167
Well, up to that point, I'd never missed a day in 
school alive. So he hadn't get special permission

03:05.650 --> 03:11.119
from my parents to miss school the first time. So I 
got somebody to carry me to Palestine in the mud by

03:12.442 --> 03:22.500
the way of Slocum because the road was blocked to 
get there otherwise and caught a train. come to

03:22.480 --> 03:24.044
Hearn. And the delay was in Palestine, and they got 
to Hearn. The other train was gone. But there's

03:32.708 --> 03:36.017
three or four boys on the train from Palestine. One 
of them was in my brother's class, and we got

03:37.313 --> 03:40.497
acquainted. He said, the college station train 
will be gone when we get there, but we'll get you to

03:41.539 --> 03:47.968
the campus. So we walked through about a mile of 
construction work and got out on the highway.

03:55.198 --> 03:58.883
We took the order in which who had the earliest 
classes to hitchhike a ride, and everybody got to

03:58.863 --> 04:04.632
campus by eight o'clock. And he wanted me to see the 
Arkansas series, which I did. Now, this is

04:11.543 --> 04:12.604
basketball? Basketball. In those days, they 
played two games every other year rather than home

04:14.147 --> 04:20.737
and home in a year. And he didn't even go with me 
because it was pouring down rain. to go from the

04:26.386 --> 04:30.552
Shacks to the G. Raleigh White D-wear. So they 
dressed me up in an old campaign hat and a slicker.

04:40.768 --> 04:46.317
Everybody had insignias and three things painted 
on the back of these old slickers. And they sent me

04:47.558 --> 04:50.964
on to the game. And it was not very cold. They said, 
why don't you go barefooted? So I went across now

05:00.347 --> 05:15.202
Simpson Drill Field barefooted and got to the game 
with somebody else's coupon book and the OD on the

05:00.347 --> 05:15.202
gate said, you can't come in here barefooted. And 
so I got him off the side and told him what my

05:15.222 --> 05:23.730
situation was and he said, well, wait till the 
traffic gets a little lighter. and you come on to

05:23.710 --> 05:27.134
the door and I'll pass you in. So that was a really 
interesting experience of that night. But seeing

05:33.581 --> 05:51.861
the campus during the day while he was in class, and 
about a third of that was sent in the veterinary

05:33.581 --> 05:51.861
medicine display of old Dr. Francis, I decided I 
should be over here too.

05:53.343 --> 06:01.317
So, he graduated in 30 and I come in 31, September 
31. Was that your only visit to the campus before

06:02.439 --> 06:05.985
coming to enroll? No, in 1927 I had a bachelor 
cousin who had tickets for the Thanksgiving game.

06:15.601 --> 06:17.504
And he had a date. He was never married. He had a date 
and had a third ticket, and my brother had gotten

06:18.465 --> 06:22.851
for him. And he said, I want you to ride College 
Station with me to the football game. So I come to

06:29.481 --> 06:38.233
see the Thanksgiving game in 1927 with them, and I 
still have my ticket untorn. And don't ask too many

06:38.213 --> 06:42.759
questions about how I got in without tearing my 
ticket. And that was my first trip. It was during

06:45.923 --> 06:50.289
Joel Hunt and Herschel Burgess's day. And so that 
was my first trip, and this week's visit was my

06:50.309 --> 06:56.196
second trip. And I thought, well, if it was good 
enough for him, it's good enough for me. All right,

07:02.705 --> 07:05.108
then when you come to enroll? When? Well, describe 
that also. When was it? Describe that trip. I would

07:12.014 --> 07:16.079
say about mid-December, September 1931. I came to 
school alone in the same 1924 Model T Ford out of

07:16.219 --> 07:34.343
Houston County to get to Madison County, which is 
now Highway 21, across the river on a ferry boat.

07:36.078 --> 07:38.264
The Navasota? No, the Trinity. Oh, the Trinity, 
yes. The Trinity River, and come on over and they

07:40.750 --> 07:47.167
said, you can't have a car. I said, what are you 
going to do with it?" And there was a Houston County

07:49.568 --> 08:05.229
clubhouse that Dr. Dan Russell started down about 
the Boyette community, and they said, you can

07:49.568 --> 08:05.229
leave your car down here, and we won't know who it 
belonged to. So I left my car there, and I think I

08:06.411 --> 08:11.097
carried it home Thanksgiving and left it. But 
that's the way I got here, and I joined the Company G

08:11.077 --> 08:19.450
infantry. Only for one reason, there was two or 
three seniors and one junior from Crockett in

08:21.202 --> 08:34.495
Company G, and so they hung around the rotunda of 
the academic building during the restoration.

08:34.535 --> 08:47.648
When it comes to the ROCC assignment, they stepped 
up to the sergeant's desk and said, we'd like to

08:34.535 --> 08:47.648
have this young fella in Company G infantry. And 
that's the way I got in Company G infantry, and I

08:47.628 --> 08:53.434
thought it was a good outfit. My senior year, when I 
was a freshman, Tiger Teague was our company

08:54.716 --> 09:00.121
commander. He was company commander when you were 
a senior? No, when I was a freshman. When you were a

09:04.326 --> 09:04.987
freshman. Oh, really? Well, now let's sidetrack 
on him. Describe Tiger Teague as a student. Well,

09:11.894 --> 09:15.458
him being a senior and I being a freshman, He 
graduated on time, I think, maybe one extra

09:17.277 --> 09:27.237
semester, because he worked part-time in the 
postal system as a mail sorter. On the campus or at

09:28.246 --> 09:30.469
the Northgate Post Office? No, the Northgate Post 
Office wasn't there. It was a little old building

09:32.772 --> 09:38.418
down close to where the Grove is now. Small 
building where they handled all the mail. But that

09:41.202 --> 09:42.924
was a federal post office. Yeah, a federal post 
office. And he sorted mail every night till about

09:44.966 --> 09:48.651
1030. And he'd walk across the drill field from his 
post office job to his dormitory, which was

09:50.033 --> 09:57.662
Brazil. I was in room 105 as well, first and next to 
the entrance on the bottom floor, west side.

10:08.150 --> 10:15.462
Crossing that drill field, he could observe half 
of his unit, whether they were studying or not.

10:15.482 --> 10:17.085
What kind of a CO was he? He was a great CO. He had 
everybody's interest at heart and saw that you had

10:19.252 --> 10:26.206
study time undisturbed. But if you were not taking 
advantage of his study time when he was walking

10:28.029 --> 10:36.346
across the drill field, he had a private session 
with you later. Don't I remember him as not very

10:37.468 --> 10:39.512
tall? No, he wasn't very tall, but one of the best 
softball pitchers the world has ever known.

10:45.840 --> 10:46.441
Really? He softball pitcher when he was in the 
legislature with an artificial foot, and he lost

10:46.461 --> 10:57.310
one of his ankles in the World War II. And that was 
mended, and he had a short shoe and a sharp corner on

10:58.311 --> 11:09.060
the bottom so he could walk, but he still pitched 
baseball. And his legislative team won with him as

11:09.040 --> 11:13.045
a pitcher. But he was a good commander, and there 
was three other seniors in the outfit from

11:13.065 --> 11:19.674
Crockett. So I had a good tie there, and they helped 
me a lot. Let's see. Oh, when you came to enroll,

11:26.263 --> 11:31.150
what did you bring with you? in terms of clothing 
and anything else? I don't remember exactly what I

11:34.375 --> 11:44.267
brought, but they gave us a list of what to bring, 
and it wasn't much more than they needed because

11:34.375 --> 11:44.267
you wore your uniform all the time. There was no 
time you could be without your uniform on certain

11:44.427 --> 11:53.698
occasions, any class or all classes as it is now. 
Where did you get the money to pay for that first

11:56.611 --> 11:58.053
year? My parents had set aside that for me, and 
since my brother enjoyed it so much and graduated,

11:58.273 --> 12:07.625
they were well pleased. They did not have a big 
operation, but they provided enough for my older

12:08.446 --> 12:20.020
brother and my younger sister to get a college 
education. Did it seem to you that you had a choice

12:20.422 --> 12:26.711
about whether you would go to college or did your 
parents, were they determined you were going to

12:20.422 --> 12:26.711
go? No, I think they strictly left it up to me 
because I had to make the choice. Do you remember

12:34.002 --> 12:36.726
what that first year cost? No, but it was very 
little compared to what it was now. I worked in the

12:41.913 --> 12:48.443
dining hall of Sabisa as a student waiter my last 
three years. But not the first year? No, not the

12:50.257 --> 13:02.455
first year, and that come about because of the 
generosity of Coach Frank Anderson, the track

12:50.257 --> 13:02.455
coach, in the intramural track meet in the spring. 
I won three events, the high hurdles, the low

13:04.498 --> 13:10.206
hurdles, and the high jump. And about a week later, 
I ran into Colonel Anderson on the campus, and he

13:11.148 --> 13:27.047
said, I observed your intramural track meet, and 
I'd like for you to finish out the rest of the track

13:11.148 --> 13:27.047
season with the freshman track team. they did not 
go anywhere and compete with anybody. It was all

13:30.443 --> 13:32.225
called telegraphic. And they'd run against 
Tarleton and Arlington and through a few other

13:33.227 --> 13:47.142
junior colleges and then compare their results by 
telephone or wire. And so I went out and He had more

13:53.133 --> 13:58.760
good hurdlers than he needed, so he concentrated 
me on high jump. And I had an old system that most

13:59.862 --> 14:03.306
rural kids had. They called it a scissor. And he 
said, if you'll let me, I'll improve you from now to

14:05.269 --> 14:11.477
next year nearly a foot. And I said, well, I'm in 
favor of that. When do we start? And so I made

14:17.164 --> 14:20.929
letters and track. and he got the dining hall job 
for me, and that paid just for your meals. Just for

14:30.488 --> 14:31.751
your meals. They paid you, but you paid for your 
meals. And it was a break-even? Break-even for

14:35.959 --> 14:38.344
your board. And you did that your... Just 
sophomore, junior, and senior year. All right.

14:43.542 --> 14:47.306
Let's stay back with this freshman year. When you 
got here, describe the major buildings on the

14:47.386 --> 14:51.610
campus. What was here in 1931? Well, the most 
important one was Brazell Hall. And sophomore

14:58.537 --> 15:01.620
year, I went to Hart. Junior year, I went to 
Leggett. And senior year, I went to Foster. and

15:09.087 --> 15:20.385
faucets had been removed, and the lake had been 
removed, and the old academic building, as we call

15:09.087 --> 15:20.385
it now, was most of the classrooms. The military 
science had a few outside classrooms, but the

15:21.327 --> 15:27.457
campus was very small. They had the Aggieland Inn 
at the north gate across the street from Sivisa

15:27.477 --> 15:31.804
Hall. And there was no dormitories in that area at 
all, and a few businesses at the north gate. I don't

15:40.315 --> 15:41.476
remember how many. Was Guyon Hall the south end of 
the buildings? Guyon Hall was the south end of what

15:47.464 --> 15:51.589
we called Military Wall. And there was nothing 
beyond it except faculty and staff houses? beyond

15:56.962 --> 15:58.746
that. For every formation, three times a day, 
every cadet outfit formed on military walks and

16:00.229 --> 16:10.971
walked to the dining hall for meals. in a very 
short, quick order because they entered sometime

16:11.913 --> 16:31.812
in three different entrances to get to the dining 
hall and everything in the way of salads and

16:11.913 --> 16:31.812
drinking water and some of the items were already 
on the table, and when the troops got to the table,

16:31.792 --> 16:39.706
then the waiter provided the rest of it. And that 
was much easier for me in my last two years because

16:40.788 --> 16:55.234
the

16:40.788 --> 16:55.234
supervision of Sabisa Hall at that time was a 
retired World One Army sergeant named King. It was

17:01.084 --> 17:05.793
about, even with my shoulder was his height, but he 
was a good one. He said, since you're an athlete and

17:06.694 --> 17:15.329
you eat on a training table, we gonna let you have 
that as your responsibility. So the last two

17:16.211 --> 17:18.555
years, All I had to do was go and get the necessary 
plates for the number of athletes I had, and their

17:18.535 --> 17:33.530
people had water and a lot of stuff already on the 
table. One interesting item there, I believe it

17:35.472 --> 17:47.243
was my senior year, the basketball squad had only 
sixteen people on it, including the managers and

17:35.472 --> 17:47.243
the trainers. And I could carry a tray with four 
prepared plates on the tray. Four, eight, or

17:53.857 --> 17:55.141
twelve. And to keep making two trips of eight, I 
told them to put all eight of them, all 16 of them on

17:59.913 --> 18:11.407
one tray, four high

17:59.913 --> 18:11.407
and four around. And I just made one trip back to the 
main dining hall. And I noticed Sergeant King kept

18:18.516 --> 18:22.160
eyeing me pretty close. So I knew him pretty well. 
So one day I visited with him. I said, Sergeant

18:28.111 --> 18:31.396
King, have I been doing something wrong? I said, 
you spent a lot of your time watching me. He says,

18:36.783 --> 18:44.614
well, you're not doing anything wrong, but I want 
to see you when you drop that first 16 plates. Did

18:44.634 --> 18:45.575
you ever drop it? No. I made sure I didn't. But I 
could go there, and at the same time the athletes

18:50.902 --> 18:58.533
did, and it was a good assignment. So I owe a lot to 
Colonel Landy. Describe what it was like to be a

19:01.357 --> 19:04.441
fish in 1931. Well, you'd think if you ended about a 
week or a month, there wasn't anybody on the campus

19:05.743 --> 19:16.377
but fish, because they did everything. the 
upperclassmen would stick their head out of the

19:17.808 --> 19:21.572
door and all the freshmen. And the last one that got 
to his door ran the errand. If it was twenty

19:26.537 --> 19:36.807
freshmen, the first nineteen were excused, and 
whether it was go to the post office or go get

19:26.537 --> 19:36.807
cleaning or whatever was necessary. And we had one 
freshman per upperclassmen room to put it in

19:37.808 --> 19:46.296
order. And it seemed like a very tremendous chore 
and an unfair thing your first year, but after your

19:46.276 --> 19:58.930
first year you felt like you had earned your 
apprenticeship. So I'm sure there's nothing like

19:59.771 --> 20:03.696
that now. What was a normal class day like? When did 
it begin and what happened during that? Eight to

20:10.323 --> 20:13.466
twelve and one to five, there was no... But what 
time did you get up? I don't remember, probably

20:16.060 --> 20:30.986
about six, I believe we formed to go to the morning 
formation in time to get to the dining hall by seven

20:16.060 --> 20:30.986
so everybody could get to class. But there was no 
night classes, there was no noon classes because

20:32.088 --> 20:41.123
they had plenty of room, twenty of classroom 
space. Let's make believe that during that day you

20:41.525 --> 20:46.454
had an hour that was unscheduled. You had free 
time. Where could a fish spend any free time? He

20:51.504 --> 20:55.271
better be in his room studying. It's a place for 
him. He can get an excuse maybe to go to the library

20:58.698 --> 21:03.988
to study, but you had to put a note on your door. 
telling you what part of the library you'll be in,

21:04.272 --> 21:11.439
because they wanted you to take full advantage of 
your study time. In fact, I lived as a junior in

21:12.420 --> 21:19.287
Mitchell Hall with a boy that was a sophomore. His 
dad was a senator, Texas senator, Nat Patton. And

21:25.413 --> 21:29.757
he wasn't too good a student, and they asked me if I 
would room with him. And I said, yes, if it'll help.

21:33.914 --> 21:40.061
And he said, well, if you can get him to go to class 
and make him study, you'll have done a good chore.

21:40.101 --> 21:46.989
So Annette Patton and I roomed together when he was 
a sophomore and I was a junior. And it was well worth

21:47.009 --> 21:56.520
my effort, because he graduated.

21:57.057 --> 22:03.946
Do you remember anything that today we would call 
hazing that occurred during your fresh year? Yes,

22:06.269 --> 22:09.553
it was hazing, day and night. Can you give some 
examples?

22:14.540 --> 22:17.584
Well, I don't guess they can go back and prosecute 
anybody. I don't think so. But the board, or paddle

22:20.428 --> 22:26.676
as they call it, the board was a ruling instrument. 
whether you were a good freshman or a bad freshman,

22:28.732 --> 22:36.322
or a good sophomore or a bad sophomore. They were 
not above the board, too. And a lot of people went

22:39.667 --> 22:47.237
home because of that aspect of it. I don't know what 
our percentage was, but those that stayed were

22:47.978 --> 22:53.225
glad they stayed. But it was a real rampage. Now 
where would the paddling occur? In the hallway? In

23:02.492 --> 23:05.574
the hallway, in the hallway. Very few night 
sergeants would ever intercede or break it up

23:06.035 --> 23:15.523
because they knew it was a common practice. Can you 
give any examples of what we today might label good

23:17.425 --> 23:21.649
bull? Surely you freshmen must have played some 
tricks on some upperclassmen Only one time a year.

23:30.992 --> 23:31.433
What was that? On what we called Fish Day in the 
spring. Fish were sophomores, and sophomores

23:35.697 --> 23:38.560
were fish. And that was an all-day fun thing, and 
sometimes you come out worse than you went in. But

23:47.950 --> 23:54.036
it was a fun day for everybody, and they all looked 
forward to it. Were there drownouts in those days?

23:55.978 --> 23:57.700
Yes. What kind of bomb? BABO. No, I think water is 
the only thing I recall and it was somebody that was

24:00.769 --> 24:21.488
goofing off or they didn't like or for some reason 
like that and nobody was barred from from that

24:00.769 --> 24:21.488
regardless of class. Now during your fish year you 
were not working in the dining hall so you ate with

24:22.609 --> 24:28.294
your outfit Describe the dining hall routine for a 
freshman. Everybody went in together and had

24:36.478 --> 24:40.967
campaign hats. wooden chairs so your hat could go 
under the chair, and everybody was seated about

24:42.044 --> 24:51.777
the same time. The food dishes were passed to all 
the upperclassmen, and it was usually not

24:53.379 --> 25:09.942
necessary for seconds to get the first serving all 
the way around.

25:10.985 --> 25:15.652
I do not recall any harassment at all while you were 
eating. It was custom in those days that you could

25:17.355 --> 25:27.670
not have your pie, it was known as kush of course, 
you could not have your pie for 35 days. My class was

25:28.672 --> 25:29.713
35. For 35 days you could have all the pie you 
wanted, but you had to eat it under the table. For

25:36.984 --> 25:38.286
the first 35 days? For the first. For the first 35 
days. Now, had you gotten that report yet? No, I

25:45.065 --> 25:45.905
hadn't heard. That's a new one. So, I don't know how 
it went when the classes got to 50 and 60. Did you

25:52.112 --> 25:53.954
literally sit on the floor? Yeah, sit on the floor 
and sit. And hold your plate and eat? That's right.

25:59.259 --> 26:07.688
And the tables were made with three wooden boards 
and a cloth over it, but they were not waterproof.

26:08.393 --> 26:36.730
and it was a normal just a thing to pour water on the 
table once freshmen got under there to eat their

26:08.393 --> 26:36.730
pie but they could have all the pie they wanted go 
meal hound it get it from other tables and go under

26:08.393 --> 26:36.730
there and share share like with the number it was 
under there and the time we got through

26:08.393 --> 26:36.730
everybody's going to class but we had enough time 
to get to class now as you recall Did you always get

26:37.267 --> 26:39.915
as much to eat as you wanted? Yeah. Everybody 
gained weight. What were your favorite varieties

26:43.487 --> 26:47.078
of A&M dining hall food? What did you like best in 
the dining hall? Oh, I don't recall. All the meals

26:52.600 --> 27:04.756
were very nourishable, particularly when they 
had roast or steak or something like that and a

26:52.600 --> 27:04.756
couple of vegetables and a drink. So I don't 
remember. We ate what they put out, and everybody

27:07.800 --> 27:10.744
gained weight. Was there any food that you ate here 
for the first time, anything new? I don't think so.

27:18.458 --> 27:22.786
Because I'm assuming there wasn't any pizza and 
there wasn't any Mexican food and there wasn't any

27:18.458 --> 27:22.786
Chinese. No, no, that was before that time. And you 
might have had some fresh vegetables at home in the

27:25.611 --> 27:40.399
garden that you wouldn't get on the table, but it 
was a tremendous responsibility to feed them. Mr.

27:40.379 --> 27:50.749
Duncan lived across the hall, across the side 
street from the rear west corner of Sabeza Hall.

27:51.489 --> 27:57.875
There was a building there that the YMCA widow also 
lived in. Mrs. Cashin? Mrs. Cashin was there for

27:58.896 --> 28:01.399
quite some time. And they all lived over there, but 
the family came across the street and they ate in a

28:02.119 --> 28:10.167
special dining room of their own.

28:11.547 --> 28:17.837
and did it, I guess, 21 times a week if they wanted to 
eat. And you could not take food out of a dining

28:19.339 --> 28:22.103
hall. Did you students ever violate that rule? 
Yes, because we were responsible for the first

28:26.289 --> 28:33.220
revelry that ever came in the campus. One of our 
class members picked the dog up after being hit by a

28:33.240 --> 28:38.668
car. at what's now the East Gate. It was just a dirt 
road. They'd been to Houston and hitchhiking at

28:43.854 --> 28:53.450
home, and somebody had run over this dog, and she 
was in the ditch injured. So they brought her to the

28:54.131 --> 29:02.144
dormitory, and we had a couple of senior vet 
students, and they took care of the dog. How old was

29:02.625 --> 29:03.947
that dog then? I would say she's probably a year 
old, very young dog. They bandaged her leg and got

29:10.886 --> 29:15.513
her back to normal. Several classes still claim 
the first Reveille, but I know who the first

29:17.275 --> 29:24.085
Reveille is responsible for. She came same time we 
did, and only just a few weeks after we did.

29:29.553 --> 29:33.478
Describe her in terms of color and size. just about 
the exact image of the bronze statue in the Cadet

29:33.914 --> 29:54.100
Center, because that was taken from a picture, one 
of the first pictures ever made of her with a little

29:33.914 --> 29:54.100
blanket made for her purpose.

29:55.514 --> 30:07.903
And the four classes that were in school at the time 
she was here first wanted to make that monument to

29:55.514 --> 30:07.903
go in there.

30:10.465 --> 30:11.487
four, I believe. One class declined, so we got 36, 
37, 38, and 39.

30:18.678 --> 30:28.254
Anyway, four classes together and put that thing 
together and took up a donation from class after we

30:18.678 --> 30:28.254
graduated, of course. And she was certainly not a 
purebred Oh, no. But the bronze image is very, very

30:32.577 --> 30:46.574
good of her because of the color of her feet, and the 
body features, and the way she held her tail. One

30:46.634 --> 30:53.823
ear was higher than the other, and the discoveries 
did a wonderful job. Did, when the dog was first in

30:54.464 --> 31:00.992
the dormitory, were there any times when Doug was 
almost forced out by his... No, not in the

31:01.225 --> 31:06.896
dormitory. There was a little problem in the 
dining hall until Sergeant King agreed that if

31:06.916 --> 31:22.626
everybody thought enough of her that she ought to 
eat in the dining hall, she'd come and go as she

31:06.916 --> 31:22.626
wished.
