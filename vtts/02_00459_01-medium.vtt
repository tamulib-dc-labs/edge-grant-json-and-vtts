This is Brent Weldon interviewing Bill Farmer on 
the subject of Vietnam. Do you acknowledge that

00:11.818 --> 00:18.844
you're in using this for a donation to the oral 
history collection for Texas A&M University?

00:18.864 --> 00:21.947
Yes.

00:21.987 --> 00:24.890
Could you first start when and where you were born? 
I was born here in Waco, Texas in 1949, June. Did you

00:31.908 --> 00:32.789
grow up here? Grew up in Waco. Okay. Where did you go 
to school, high school? Graduated from

00:37.135 --> 00:40.259
University High School here in Waco. Okay. Did you 
go to college anywhere? Yes. I went to MCC,

00:44.204 --> 00:51.113
graduated from Baylor University, got my 
master's degree from North Texas State

00:44.204 --> 00:51.113
University. Okay. When did you graduate? When did 
you get those? Graduated from Baylor in 1974 and

00:55.118 --> 01:01.847
received my master's in 19... 81, I believe, if I 
remember correctly. And what time did you serve in

01:07.568 --> 01:09.530
Vietnam? From September of 1968 to September of 
1969. And what branch and outfit was that? Well, I

01:19.861 --> 01:21.903
was with the United States Army. My immediate 
assignment was with 378th Maintenance Company

01:23.084 --> 01:33.015
and was TDY with 11th Armored Cavalry Regiment. 
Why did you volunteer instead of waiting to be

01:34.295 --> 01:40.885
drafted or trying to get a deferment? Well, I was 18 
years old. College wasn't where I wanted to be at

01:44.711 --> 01:47.375
that particular time. It wasn't doing too well. 
And I just felt the need to go. My parents had been,

01:53.084 --> 02:01.517
my dad had been, my uncles had been in Korea all the 
way back to World War I, my grandfathers, my

01:53.084 --> 02:01.517
cousins. I had cousins in Vietnam. I just felt like 
it was where I needed to do instead of wasting my

02:03.100 --> 02:08.229
time doing nothing. Okay. Did you feel that the 
United States was right in responding by sending

02:10.233 --> 02:16.564
troops for combat? Yes, I do. I think we were doing 
the right thing. Why did you feel like that? Well,

02:24.058 --> 02:25.260
at that time... You know, communism was a big 
thing. We still had the Cold War was going on, the

02:27.476 --> 02:34.345
threat of nuclear war, the spread of communism, 
the things that you hear about all the time. Okay. I

02:35.327 --> 02:37.610
really felt like it was the right thing to do. We 
needed to stop it in Southeast Asia. Okay. Did you

02:41.615 --> 02:45.461
feel that when you went in, did you feel that the 
United States would win? Most definitely. Most

02:46.843 --> 02:48.285
definitely. Never thought we would lose the war. 
You just felt that we would never lose? Is that why?

02:53.993 --> 02:54.233
Okay. Okay. How did you feel in response? I still 
debate the fact that we lost the war. We didn't lose

02:58.817 --> 02:59.899
the war. Congress helped us maybe, but we didn't 
lose the war. How did you feel in response to

03:04.164 --> 03:08.911
friends and acquaintances who could have gone and 
didn't go? Well, I never really knew anyone who

03:10.092 --> 03:14.078
tried to avoid the war. Some who went to school were 
there that I knew of were there because they wanted

03:14.258 --> 03:19.244
to get education. It was not to dodge the war, so 
it's hard to answer that. My immediate friends...

03:24.607 --> 03:31.696
They either went or they were in school for a real 
reason, or they couldn't go for medical reasons. I

03:31.837 --> 03:34.540
really had no one to try to dodge the war that I know 
of. Oh, that's interesting.

03:39.226 --> 03:41.309
How did you feel about the strategic bombing? Did 
you feel it was effective? Well, I feel like it was

03:43.552 --> 03:45.715
doing what it was supposed to do. I remember there 
were a lot of times where we didn't have any contact

03:45.855 --> 03:51.643
with the enemy, and I thought it was due to the 
bombing. Nixon halted the bombing, I guess,

03:52.265 --> 03:59.512
October, November 1968, somewhere there. It's 
been such a long time. Immediately after that, it

04:00.774 --> 04:07.040
wasn't long and the enemy activity picked up all 
through the country, as far as I know. So, did you

04:09.382 --> 04:16.009
feel that you were adequately trained when you got 
there for what you had to do? Well, not really.

04:17.851 --> 04:20.754
Mostly you learned from others on the job 
training. I felt it was very difficult to train for

04:22.960 --> 04:27.768
what we were doing and for the kind of war we were 
fighting, because it was a whole different kind of

04:22.960 --> 04:27.768
war. It wasn't like anything that we had done 
before. Even my dad had talked about being in the

04:32.816 --> 04:45.938
Philippines in World War II, and after we'd talked 
a little bit, and he said even, it didn't sound like

04:32.816 --> 04:45.938
it was even the same thing then, and his was a 
jungle-type warfare in World War II. So I don't

04:46.098 --> 04:48.462
know as we were trained as well as we needed to be. I 
don't know if we had enough knowledge to train the

04:53.151 --> 04:58.537
way we needed to. Until the latter part of the war, 
and by the time we got to that point, it was

04:59.098 --> 05:06.007
basically too late. So I think most of it was 
on-the-job training. Okay. Did you... How did the

05:11.013 --> 05:18.162
anti-war activism in the States, did that make you 
feel... How did that make you feel while you were in

05:18.682 --> 05:20.644
the service? Did it have any kind of impact in 
Vietnam? Well, it made a lot angry, particularly

05:24.467 --> 05:32.975
those that were probably young like I was. It 
bothered us a little bit to read the newspapers, to

05:33.055 --> 05:40.382
get a news clip or something of all this stuff that 
was going on. It was bothersome. And many of the

05:42.063 --> 05:47.608
older, what few there were, the older military 
people, of course they were in the military for

05:48.415 --> 05:54.283
life so it really bothered them that this was going 
on. Was there any kind of anti-war around where you

05:55.064 --> 05:59.609
were at? Not particularly. We had the typical 
things you see in the movies, guys wearing peace

06:01.392 --> 06:14.068
signs and you know a lot of guys would talk about 
wish they were somewhere else and didn't know why

06:01.392 --> 06:14.068
they were there and things like that but when push 
came to shove everyone that I've ever been in

06:14.504 --> 06:19.089
contact with did their job and was proud to serve. 
They may not have liked being there, but they did

06:20.351 --> 06:24.275
what they felt like they had to do.

06:27.679 --> 06:35.148
How did you feel about Nixon's Vietnamization 
policy before, during, and then after the war?

06:35.168 --> 06:40.394
Well, it was a good goal, but it wasn't too 
realistic from what little bit. You know, I don't

06:40.434 --> 06:42.857
know that much about that kind of thing. But I do 
know that most of the time, even though the

06:43.681 --> 06:58.480
Vietnamese really tried very hard, most of them 
had been fighting for so many years, it was hard for

06:43.681 --> 06:58.480
them to, I don't know if motivated is a good word or 
not, to continue the fight. Many of their troops

06:59.441 --> 07:10.515
were very good fighters, and many of their troops 
also,

06:59.441 --> 07:10.515
I don't know, it wasn't that they were bad 
fighters, it's just that they didn't, do what they

07:12.031 --> 07:14.154
needed to do at times. It was scary for them. It was 
just such a long, drawn out thing. And like I said,

07:19.482 --> 07:27.695
we were there 10, 11, 12 years maybe, a little bit 
before that with advisors, but those guys had been

07:19.482 --> 07:27.695
fighting for 25 and 30 years. So it was hard for them 
just to keep on keeping on.

07:35.046 --> 07:38.511
How did you feel about the TV and newspaper 
journalists that were over there? Well, we didn't

07:39.807 --> 07:42.210
really have that much contact with them. They were 
around here and there, but really they weren't

07:42.230 --> 07:52.585
very, I don't know if effective is a good word. They 
didn't bother us. We did our job, and they weren't

07:54.407 --> 07:57.692
around very long. They would be there, and then 
they were gone doing something else. So really

08:01.257 --> 08:02.739
couldn't say a whole lot about it. Did they ever 
interview anybody? No. They were taking pictures

08:06.925 --> 08:09.308
more than anything else. Was that bothersome that 
they took a lot of pictures or anything? No, not

08:15.014 --> 08:23.263
necessarily, because most of the pictures they 
took were at times where they weren't in the way or

08:15.014 --> 08:23.263
where they weren't in real danger. I'm sure there 
were some media people who were in situations

08:23.323 --> 08:33.675
where it was quite dangerous, but I was never 
around those that were in that situation. So my

08:34.904 --> 08:42.634
next question was if you felt that the journalists 
took away from morale at all. Would that affect you

08:42.694 --> 08:44.557
at all? Well, we never had any. I never knew of any 
that said or did anything to knock what we were

08:46.259 --> 08:53.229
doing. They were all supportive as far as I know.

08:59.817 --> 09:03.983
I had asked you this before, but do you feel that war 
should have been declared on the records?

09:07.000 --> 09:12.326
Well, only if they would allow the war to actually 
be fought. I don't feel like, and I know many

09:12.887 --> 09:20.736
others,

09:12.887 --> 09:20.736
don't feel like we were allowed to fight the war. I 
mean, why declare a war if you're not allowed to

09:21.176 --> 09:23.839
fight it? You know, like it ought to be fought, put 
an end to it. We're held back. So I don't see the

09:27.984 --> 09:29.406
need. I didn't see the need, and still don't, why 
there would have been a declaration of war. Maybe

09:33.590 --> 09:36.754
it would have made Congress feel good, but... When 
you're prevented from doing your job in some ways,

09:37.072 --> 09:42.519
well, what's the use? For those in the field, it 
really didn't make a difference. Right. If it had

09:49.127 --> 09:57.998
been your decision, would you have done something 
different than what was done? Like, they sent

09:58.939 --> 10:01.823
troops, but they didn't declare war. Would you 
have done something different than that if you had

10:01.843 --> 10:06.589
had a say? Well, I don't know enough about what all 
we had. But I think that we, given the opportunity,

10:09.477 --> 10:15.487
maybe we should have declared war. And then we 
could have went on in. And we needed to go ahead and

10:18.271 --> 10:21.957
invade North Vietnam, put an end to it. So we were 
fighting a defensive war rather than an

10:21.977 --> 10:24.681
aggressive war. And we should have went on and did 
what we needed to do. If it meant crossing into

10:28.687 --> 10:35.277
North Vietnam, we needed to do that, or into 
Cambodia, or Laos, or whatever. I know we were in

10:35.594 --> 10:40.140
those areas when we weren't supposed to be, but 
that should have never happened. We should have

10:40.220 --> 10:42.624
been there if we needed to be there and go on. Now 
that's a low soldier's idea. The general advice

10:49.093 --> 10:53.839
had to look a little different, but we wanted to 
win. What do you think the difference would have

10:54.220 --> 10:56.884
made if war had been declared? Well, if we had have 
declared war, we might have went ahead and did some

10:57.965 --> 11:02.952
things that we didn't do. We might have really... 
went on the aggressive rather than trying to be

11:05.750 --> 11:10.134
fighting defensively. I don't see how you can win a 
war defensively. What do you think their

11:15.159 --> 11:20.405
objectives were for sending troops over? Well, I 
think the whole thing was just to buy time so that

11:20.425 --> 11:29.914
the Vietnamization program would work and they 
could fight their own war, but that was never going

11:20.425 --> 11:29.914
to happen. It didn't take long to really realize 
that, and then we got ourselves in so deep, it seems

11:29.954 --> 11:35.520
to me like we wouldn't quit. We wouldn't shut it 
down. We wouldn't stop. There was no easy way out.

11:43.398 --> 11:49.624
No one wanted to ever lose the war, but yet we didn't 
do the things we needed to do to actually win the

11:43.398 --> 11:49.624
war.

11:52.927 --> 11:55.750
There was talk about use of atomic bombs. Did you 
ever hear anything about this? No. How do you feel

12:00.874 --> 12:06.199
now about the possibility of what they might have 
used atomic bombs? Well, I don't know if that would

12:06.787 --> 12:09.750
have been such a good idea. There was enough 
civilians being hurt and killed and maimed and

12:09.810 --> 12:18.738
loss of life and land and all of that. I don't know if 
that would have been really good or not. That's a

12:22.442 --> 12:23.583
hard one to call. Okay.

12:27.046 --> 12:33.452
Did you ever see any kind of use of drugs that are now 
illegal in the United States among the troops?

12:34.107 --> 12:35.329
There was drug use. I was around drug use many 
times. Some used drugs. Marijuana primarily was

12:40.176 --> 12:43.941
the drug most used. Alcohol was used quite a bit. 
But I must say that none of these things were ever

12:46.965 --> 13:00.244
done around

12:46.965 --> 13:00.244
me or anyone that I know of at a time when we were 
involved in an operation of any kind. Those things

13:00.965 --> 13:03.709
always happened. pursued that kind of activity, 
did that when we were back at a base camp or a place of

13:04.094 --> 13:10.283
safety or they were off duty. I know it doesn't make 
it right, but they did those kinds of things. I was

13:14.489 --> 13:15.130
around it. It was common practice. But again, I 
have to emphasize, no one that I know of ever did

13:16.792 --> 13:26.646
that at a time when it was life or death or on a 
mission or operation that I know of. Okay, I

13:26.947 --> 13:28.829
understand. Did you see a lot of strong apathy 
about the war while you were in it? Well, not too

13:32.478 --> 13:35.682
much, really. When I came home in 1969, the morale 
was still pretty strong. I don't think that a lot of

13:40.086 --> 13:57.706
the apathy, I don't really think that a lot of the 
drug use really, really got bad until probably

13:40.086 --> 13:57.706
toward the end of the war, 71, 72, 70, in those times 
when it was evident that we weren't going to do

13:40.086 --> 13:57.706
anything to win the war. We were just killing time, 
trying to figure a way to come home. I understand.

14:02.414 --> 14:08.302
How did you feel about the use of drugs around? 
Well, I didn't like it. I don't use drugs, and I knew

14:10.485 --> 14:17.695
a lot of good guys that did drugs, but they were 
still, I thought, were good guys. They just had a

14:17.735 --> 14:32.235
vice that I didn't think was proper, but again, 
they were smart enough or old enough or whatever

14:17.735 --> 14:32.235
you want to call it to do it where it did not affect 
the lives of those around them as far as I know. Was

14:32.907 --> 14:37.594
it ever bad enough where you were at that there were 
combat refusals or fragging? No. No? Again, I

14:38.976 --> 14:45.786
think a lot of that that you see in the movies or read 
about, I think a lot of that came late in the war.

14:45.806 --> 14:46.527
Later in the war. Okay.

14:50.313 --> 14:58.024
Did you ever have any opinion about that after you 
were here, hearing about the combat refusals and

14:50.313 --> 14:58.024
the fragging that was going on? Well...

15:02.253 --> 15:04.016
I can't see that being done. Okay, I understand. I 
just don't see it happening. I know that it did in

15:07.802 --> 15:14.093
situations, but it would be hard to make a judgment 
without actually knowing that situation.

15:14.734 --> 15:27.535
Because I know there were many times where you were 
given orders or told to do things, and maybe by

15:14.734 --> 15:27.535
someone who had only been there a short time and had 
not learned the ropes, and you'd want to say, hey,

15:14.734 --> 15:27.535
this is not how we need to do it. For the most part, 
those people who were in those positions of

15:28.308 --> 15:34.016
leadership listened to those who had been there 
before. I think maybe as the war progressed toward

15:34.858 --> 15:40.406
the end, that didn't happen like that. They didn't 
listen to those who had been there. So it wasn't

15:44.792 --> 15:57.271
unusual early, I don't think, for, say, a new 
lieutenant right out of OCS to listen to an old

15:44.792 --> 15:57.271
sergeant who'd been there six, seven, eight, 
nine, maybe in their second tour, said, hey, we

15:44.792 --> 15:57.271
need to do this a little differently. And they 
would listen. You know, they were smart enough to

15:58.548 --> 16:00.170
listen. Maybe some of these other things occurred 
later. Okay, but not while you were around? No.

16:08.039 --> 16:11.363
Okay.

16:11.383 --> 16:24.998
What did you think about, while we're talking 
about the officers, what did you think about the

16:11.383 --> 16:24.998
careerism we talked about in our class about how 
some of the officers would go in long enough to get a

16:11.383 --> 16:24.998
promotion and then they'd be transferred six 
months later? What did you think about that? Was

16:26.948 --> 16:30.033
there a lot of that where you were at? Really, no. I 
never seen too many who came in just for a while to

16:31.155 --> 16:37.184
get a little experience and ship them out. Most 
that came stayed. Stayed through their tour just

16:39.307 --> 16:42.092
like anybody else. I'm really not familiar with 
career movements or anything like that, just to

16:42.172 --> 16:50.525
get them a stripe or get them a bar or anything like 
that. I'm just not familiar with that. Did you feel

16:52.953 --> 16:59.863
that the tour of duty was 365 days, is that right? Do 
you feel that that was too short or should it have

16:59.883 --> 17:02.867
been longer? Well, I was glad it was short. I don't 
know of anyone that wasn't glad it was short. But

17:15.125 --> 17:21.795
really, it took a while for the on-the-job 
training to take place. So I don't know how much

17:22.484 --> 17:25.811
that affected our capabilities or whatever. But 
after two or three months,

17:27.073 --> 17:34.087
we probably maybe should have stayed a little bit 
longer. Because it seems like there was always

17:34.688 --> 17:37.153
somebody new. There was always someone around 
that was being trained or learning the ropes. So

17:43.786 --> 17:44.728
you never... Seemed like you had a unit that was 
working together for a full year. You were always

17:50.086 --> 17:55.933
worrying about somebody new and them learning 
ropes and trying to take care of each other. So

17:55.973 --> 17:58.036
maybe it was too short. I really don't know. What 
kind of nicknames did y'all have? Did y'all ever

18:02.001 --> 18:04.284
have any kind of pet names? No, not particularly. 
We didn't. That's pretty much Hollywood stuff. I

18:08.149 --> 18:08.850
think so. We didn't. I don't know of too many that 
did that kind of thing. I was just wondering. Did

18:14.618 --> 18:15.559
you see... A lot of racism among white and black 
troops? Not too much. You know, you had some

18:21.560 --> 18:27.869
problems every now and then that would pop up, but 
they're the same kinds of problems that would

18:21.560 --> 18:27.869
happen back in the States. You know, and it really 
wasn't caused from racism. It was more of anything

18:30.432 --> 18:36.460
caused from tiredness or too many long hours or 
getting on each other's nerves. It wasn't so much a

18:36.540 --> 18:39.724
racism type thing. I think the media and movies 
have overplayed that aspect of it. I really do.

18:46.859 --> 18:50.363
Now, I may be wrong, but I feel like it's been 
overplayed. Now, again, the latter part of the

18:51.264 --> 19:04.799
war, maybe it was more than, like I said, I was there 
in 68 and 69, so we were more interested in staying

18:51.264 --> 19:04.799
alive, taking care of each other than worrying 
about racism. So the relationship between the

19:05.000 --> 19:09.765
blacks and the whites was good when I was there. We 
always had a good relationship. We didn't split

19:11.967 --> 19:15.111
off into little groups or things like that. Was the 
relationship between the Americans and the

19:16.559 --> 19:21.927
Vietnamese the same way, or was it a lot different? 
No, we didn't really have all that much contact.

19:27.615 --> 19:31.481
The contact we had with civilians was usually 
pretty good. We didn't really have any problems

19:31.561 --> 19:34.665
with them. There wasn't a lot of racism between us 
and the Vietnamese. Most of the Vietnamese we were

19:38.170 --> 19:43.478
around

19:38.170 --> 19:43.478
needed us. needed the help, whatever. So we didn't 
really, I don't recall any real racism against

19:47.071 --> 19:53.257
Vietnamese people, per se. When you got home, how 
were you treated? Were you treated a lot

19:58.063 --> 20:00.685
differently than you were before you left? Well, 
not particularly as more, I think people wanted to

20:01.626 --> 20:06.151
just forget things. There weren't any kind of 
celebrations or anything like that. But other

20:11.082 --> 20:15.288
than that, I never experienced the negative 
things you see on TV either. When I came home in 69, I

20:15.729 --> 20:23.921
never encountered anyone that showed me any 
disrespect. There wasn't any brass bands, but

20:23.941 --> 20:32.314
there wasn't any riots or criticism or anyone 
calling me names or anything like that. So I didn't

20:32.394 --> 20:36.280
experience any of those negative things at home. I 
didn't realize that. Do you think that it might

20:38.561 --> 20:42.846
have made a little difference being here in a 
conservative part of the country? Probably so. I

20:44.989 --> 21:02.892
think when you're in the conservative South,

20:44.989 --> 21:02.892
I don't know if people are more born to duty or 
whatever or loyalty to country or whatever, but I

20:44.989 --> 21:02.892
think coming from a conservative part of the 
country, where nationalism is a big part of our

21:03.496 --> 21:18.471
life, played a part in that, as opposed to maybe 
growing up in California where it's a much more

21:03.496 --> 21:18.471
liberal society, more liberal values in some of 
these other places. I think mostly probably if you

21:19.432 --> 21:31.984
went through the South and the Midwest, I think 
probably soldiers may have been viewed a little

21:19.432 --> 21:31.984
bit differently than they were, say, on the West 
Coast or possibly even the East Coast. where

21:32.673 --> 21:40.763
people in the large cities, the big states, where 
maybe their values are a little bit more liberal

21:32.673 --> 21:40.763
than what we are in the conservative South. 
Opinion, I don't know.

21:46.310 --> 21:48.493
Who did you feel was responsible for losing the 
war? Or what do you think made them lose the war?

21:53.980 --> 22:02.410
Well, that's a hard one because I think we were 
prevented from doing some things that we needed to

21:53.980 --> 22:02.410
do to win the war. I think that Congress, with the 
War Powers Act of 1973, kind of put an end to it. We

22:13.804 --> 22:18.870
weren't able to fight the war to help the 
Vietnamese continue their Vietnamization

22:13.804 --> 22:18.870
program. So I don't know.

22:23.995 --> 22:29.421
There were just a lot of things that prevented us 
from fighting the war and winning it. I think just

22:29.722 --> 22:32.565
mainly keeping us on the defensive was the main 
thing that prevented us from winning the war. I had

22:40.050 --> 22:48.543
skipped a question before, but how did you feel 
about ARVN when they used their help from the

22:40.050 --> 22:48.543
United States? Do you think they were effective? 
Yeah, they were some well-trained and very good,

22:51.307 --> 22:56.815
many were very good fighting men. particularly 
the younger ones who were still somewhat

22:57.318 --> 23:03.867
idealistic and wanted to fight for the freedom of 
their country and things like that. I think many of

23:03.888 --> 23:13.441
the Arvin soldiers that had been fighting this war 
for so many years, 20, 25 years or so, they were just

23:03.888 --> 23:13.441
more intent on survival. But many of the younger 
Arvin soldiers, what little bit I know about them

23:13.521 --> 23:27.021
and being a little bit around them, were fighting 
the war and they felt like they were doing the right

23:13.521 --> 23:27.021
thing and they were motivated and there was a lot of 
patriotism for them in their country. As far as I

23:27.406 --> 23:30.131
know, we worked pretty well together at times. I 
never saw any real problem. Did you see corruption

23:33.618 --> 23:40.050
in the structure of their military? Really don't 
have any. way of making that call, making that kind

23:42.340 --> 23:44.965
of judgment. I really don't know. Okay.

23:49.813 --> 23:53.339
Let's see. What do you think should have been done 
different about Vietnam? I believe I asked you

23:57.827 --> 24:00.491
that already. Well, I just think we should have 
went on the offensive and fought the war. And I

24:05.239 --> 24:07.403
think if we would have done that with a weapons and 
material, the things that we had, we would have

24:07.670 --> 24:12.579
come out ahead. I don't know why we were prevented 
from that, from doing that, what our reasoning

24:13.180 --> 24:25.803
was, but

24:13.180 --> 24:25.803
you can't fight a war from a defensive position. Do 
you think that they needed more troops there? I

24:30.350 --> 24:31.672
think we had enough troops. It was just a matter of 
using the firepower. And I know you can read all the

24:33.555 --> 24:39.784
books and things about all the bombs that were 
dropped and the millions and millions of dollars

24:33.555 --> 24:39.784
and things like that. But I think things might have 
been planned a little bit better. Could have been

24:44.291 --> 24:46.294
planned a little bit better. Of course, I'm not 
that knowledgeable about what officers and

24:46.314 --> 24:52.603
generals were thinking. But I think most of the 
grunts felt like we could do a little bit better job

24:54.406 --> 24:58.973
than we did. in being allowed to fight the war. Do 
you have any idea of how that could have been done?

25:04.681 --> 25:05.783
Or no? Well, I think maybe if we'd have went on the 
offensive, went on in the north, would have played

25:07.925 --> 25:11.671
a big role. Yeah, going and invading. I think we 
might have, it would have cost a lot of lives, but if

25:13.293 --> 25:20.563
we'd have done it in the beginning of the early 60s, 
then again, it might have saved a lot of lives. Who

25:20.583 --> 25:21.144
knows? It's just an estimation, just a guess or 
whatever. And had we maybe been allowed to go on

25:26.510 --> 25:47.574
into some of these other countries and into the 
Vietnam or to the VC camps where they were held up

25:26.510 --> 25:47.574
and not having to hide it from the media and things 
of that nature late in the war, like supposedly did

25:26.510 --> 25:47.574
happen, if I'd been on the up and up and went on and 
done these things as early as 63 or 64, we might have

25:26.510 --> 25:47.574
prevented a lot of things. Only time will tell or 
won't tell. It's just too late to make those kinds

25:52.400 --> 25:55.183
of guesses. With the hindsight that you have, do 
you think we still should have gone to Vietnam?

26:02.173 --> 26:04.495
Yes, I think we should have still did that. I'm 
disappointed that we didn't finish it like we

26:04.515 --> 26:11.080
should have, but I think we were there in the 
beginning for the right reasons. I think those

26:12.341 --> 26:26.233
reasons got blinded somewhere by other things, 
maybe financial or whatever,

26:12.341 --> 26:26.233
economy and things of that nature maybe. 
Somewhere along in the beginning I think we were

26:26.416 --> 26:31.543
there for the right reasons and it got colored 
somehow.

26:35.468 --> 26:39.132
So I take it from what you just said that you would 
still have volunteered? I would have done it

26:39.152 --> 26:42.316
again. I still think it was the right thing to do at 
that time for me, for me personally. I would have

26:49.245 --> 26:50.947
still done it. Okay. Well, thank you very much. I 
appreciate it. You're welcome.
