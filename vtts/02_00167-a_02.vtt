00:02.984 --> 00:07.950
Who were some of the memorable teachers, 
advisors, counselors during your student days?

00:09.432 --> 00:16.100
Well, teachers I remember most was Square Root 
Jackson. Describe him, and why did he have that

00:16.120 --> 00:18.663
nickname? Well, he could give you the square of any 
four-digit number right out of his head. And he and

00:26.032 --> 00:29.076
Dutch Halpern were retained by one by GE and one by 
Westinghouse as mathematicians to solve their

00:30.068 --> 00:38.062
problems. They'd send them down here, and 
sometimes these guys would solve it on the

00:38.623 --> 00:43.912
envelope and mail it back to them. But when we're 
back to Dutch, I mean, Square Root Jackson,

00:43.932 --> 00:52.768
he always rode a bicycle. And when he would start, 
he was teaching algebra too. And when he would

00:59.409 --> 01:09.978
start into this and somebody would ask a question, 
it was not unusual for him to cover up all the

00:59.409 --> 01:09.978
blackboards with how you did certain things. And 
it had nothing to do with algebra. He would come in

01:14.802 --> 01:20.727
and somebody said, well, he'd ask you to hear 
something on the radio. And one time one guy said,

01:20.827 --> 01:23.970
no, he said, I kept getting static because I had a 
fluorescent lamp and it was giving me static. I

01:28.536 --> 01:30.117
didn't want to turn it out. So Square Root Jackson 
goes through the process of how he can stop that. He

01:39.285 --> 01:40.586
came into class one. We always waited to see if they 
weren't in class. Ten minutes after the hour, we

01:43.649 --> 01:45.411
walked. And boy, we just about were out of our 
seats. And Square Root walked in and said, I didn't

01:55.253 --> 01:57.797
calculate right on the headwind getting here. The 
wind was blowing pretty bad. Dutch Halpern was

02:01.143 --> 02:02.525
another one. He had a thick brogue. What did he 
teach? He taught algebra.

02:12.842 --> 02:14.765
Somebody asked a question one time. Math was over 
on the third floor of the academic building at that

02:15.786 --> 02:21.075
time. And I think everybody in class thought it was 
a pretty good question. Dutch walked over there

02:27.846 --> 02:33.355
and picked up the book and he said, you don't need 
the book, and threw it out of the window. And they

02:34.357 --> 02:35.679
made him go down and get it. And we had a hard time 
understanding Dutch. Now, that Dutch was

02:40.547 --> 02:42.149
Germanic? Yeah, he was a Dutchman. I shouldn't say 
German. I mean, he was a Dutchman. It may have been

02:49.675 --> 02:53.743
German, I don't know what we called it in Dutch. My 
trig teacher was a gal called...

02:54.344 --> 03:01.779
Galdog, what was his name? Did you say gal? No, a 
guy. Did you have any female instructors at A&M?

03:10.977 --> 03:11.498
Yes. I had one. I think it was during a summer 
session. I'll come to that when we went to three

03:15.548 --> 03:18.951
sessions. Go ahead. I had it in the name of my tongue 
a minute ago. You'll think of them later. Anyway,

03:27.720 --> 03:33.827
he'd come into class and he did the same damn thing 
every time he came into class. He would walk into

03:34.768 --> 03:39.072
class, put his stuff down on the little lectern he 
had, He'd walk over, regardless of what the

03:39.440 --> 03:47.190
weather was, he'd raise the window, and then he'd 
look out, look both ways. And then if it was a

03:49.433 --> 04:01.529
window, he'd close that window or leave it open, 
and then he'd come up to the desk, and he would write

03:49.433 --> 04:01.529
something on the blackboard, and he'd say, 
Gentlemen, I'm going to tell you exactly what that

03:49.433 --> 04:01.529
means. God, I can't think of his name. But he was 
quite a well-known trig prop. Then, Screamin'

04:09.157 --> 04:12.621
Allen Ellison. I took two classes. One of them was 
not in his class, I was underneath him, in a class

04:14.923 --> 04:23.493
underneath him, and taking two classes at once, 
because the windows were all open, you know.

04:26.657 --> 04:31.822
Then, this was after I came back from the war. I 
don't know whether I should give him that or not at

04:31.842 --> 04:36.868
this point, but it was, I just want to tell you that 
it was after the war we came back and I took English

04:37.304 --> 04:50.202
210, which was argumentative thinking, I 
believe, and John Paul Abbott taught it. He was

04:52.926 --> 04:56.190
such a dapper fellow and we all liked him very much. 
And we had a paper to write one time. And this was at a

04:59.729 --> 05:05.076
time when cold strikes were real big on the East 
Coast and all that. And so we had to write something

05:05.697 --> 05:08.842
about the cold strikes. And I wrote two 
handwritten long pages. And I had my wife and

05:17.033 --> 05:21.820
everybody check it for spelling and punctuation. 
And I thought it was letter perfect. I turned it in.

05:25.385 --> 05:26.667
I got that paper back in it. and one mark on it, and I 
had a C. So when the class was over, I went up to him

05:26.849 --> 05:40.728
and said, Dr. Abbott, why did you circle this? 
There's nothing wrong with the spelling or

05:40.768 --> 05:51.983
anything there, and give me a C. He said, you used 
the word striking personnel, and I think it should

05:40.768 --> 05:51.983
have been strikers. And I said, Dr. Abbott, It's my 
paper, I wrote it. He said, yeah, but I'm the one

05:58.302 --> 06:02.308
that graced it. And you still got a C? I still got a C 
on that paper. And we became very good friends

06:06.675 --> 06:09.960
later on after I came to work here. He was well liked 
by everybody. We

06:13.525 --> 06:25.759
had, Paul Mason was one in drawing, and then of 
course I got to go to the industrial education

06:13.525 --> 06:25.759
department, Chris Gronemann. Describe him. He 
was a wonderful teacher, and started me, because I

06:29.023 --> 06:41.777
quit engineering and went into industrial 
education, because I knew, it was my background of

06:29.023 --> 06:41.777
stuff in spirit, and I knew I couldn't make it. I had 
hard enough time with algebra, let alone to go with

06:42.247 --> 06:46.731
calculus.

06:49.794 --> 07:03.406
He

06:49.794 --> 07:03.406
was a real good—he kind of convinced me that I ought 
to walk, because he talked about his high school

06:49.794 --> 07:03.406
teaching days back in Oklahoma.

07:05.448 --> 07:10.532
And, of course, we had

07:05.448 --> 07:10.532
the machinist

07:13.212 --> 07:23.147
Pop Wagner, and then a guy that taught foundry, and 
a guy that taught pattern making. What was it?

07:25.090 --> 07:25.491
Downard. Downard. Pop Downard was in the machine 
shop. The guy that taught foundry. Watson?

07:36.027 --> 07:36.527
Watson. Watson. Before the war started, what was a 
typical days routine for you on a Monday through

07:42.727 --> 07:47.094
Friday basis? What time did you get up and what did 
you do when? Well before the war they instituted

07:50.419 --> 08:07.705
when we moved over into the new new area they 
decided we needed to have calisthenics and we

07:50.419 --> 08:07.705
resented the heck out of it because we had to get up 
early in the morning All of the cadets would go down

08:08.512 --> 08:17.763
in a quad, and one of the senior officers would lead 
us in about 30 minutes to calisthenics. And we

08:19.205 --> 08:20.807
said, we're going to fix them. We're going to all go 
to breakfast, and we're just going to eat them out

08:20.867 --> 08:25.092
of house and home. We never made a dent in what they 
had. But then we cleaned up our rooms and

08:28.016 --> 08:33.422
everything and got ready to go to class. If we 
didn't have a class, well, we probably studied.

08:37.247 --> 08:38.248
What time did you get up? I want to say it was before 
six o'clock, because I think breakfast was at

08:40.540 --> 09:00.071
seven, if I remember correctly, because we 
marched to all meals in those days, and it was all

08:40.540 --> 09:00.071
served family style, and good food, too. Nobody 
lost weight. And we went to class, and we came back,

09:04.418 --> 09:08.404
and we play some kind of a game. We all, of course, 
had intramurals. If it was intramural sports, we

09:13.143 --> 09:15.646
entered that. I was not a wrestler, but they 
decided I was going to be an entry from B Battery in

09:17.248 --> 09:23.555
wrestling one time. And I'm down at the G Raleigh 
where I was working. I was working out, and another

09:29.281 --> 09:38.070
guy was working with me, and Marshall Robnett 
comes in, and he's got a new photographer with him.

09:38.692 --> 09:42.037
And they wanted to get a picture of him refereeing 
our match. And it was all posed, and it came out in

09:43.098 --> 09:45.421
Life magazine. I have to tell everybody, I'm the 
guy on top because you can't see our faces. Now, you

09:51.389 --> 09:55.995
said you marched to every meal. Did you all march to 
lunch? Yes. And about how much free time did you

09:59.520 --> 10:08.192
have between the time you got up in the morning and 
supper? Well, it would vary. We always had a little

10:12.509 --> 10:19.118
free time, usually between classes, you know, 
which might be as much as an hour. And then we'd

10:20.019 --> 10:25.266
usually study or go to the library or go somewhere 
and get a Coke or something. And then after supper,

10:26.167 --> 10:35.619
we always would go together if the weather was 
decent. And we'd have races amongst ourselves,

10:35.639 --> 10:39.985
the intramurals. And they, I can even remember the 
guys flying kites, you know, and pitching horses.

10:51.134 --> 10:56.922
We didn't pitch, we pitched horseshoes, but that 
was in PE then, and intramural. We pitched

10:56.962 --> 10:58.364
horseshoes over there. They had a bunch of 
horseshoe places. You probably remember that.

11:03.371 --> 11:04.913
But that was really it. We didn't have, and then in 
the evening, We might go to the movie, maybe the

11:08.872 --> 11:20.164
campus theater, but Guyon Hall was a lot cheaper, 
but first started out at the assembly hall. And it

11:21.265 --> 11:26.370
was very cast-oriented by class members. 
Freshmen had certain places to seat, sophomores,

11:27.411 --> 11:33.377
juniors, and seniors.

11:34.977 --> 11:36.720
and wrote letters to her girlfriends. That's what 
I did a lot of my time was writing divorce letters,

11:37.843 --> 11:46.619
trying to make arrangements for a way to go over and 
see her on the weekend. How often did you call

11:46.639 --> 11:53.172
anybody by telephone long distance in those 
pre-war years?

11:57.050 --> 11:57.951
Not very often. I talked to Dolores on a pay phone. 
We didn't have telephones in the dorm. I talked to

12:03.860 --> 12:07.706
her, I don't know, maybe once a week. It didn't cost 
too much to call. And sometimes Mother would call,

12:11.031 --> 12:16.520
and they'd call me down to the housing office to 
take this phone call. And I'd call her collect. Did

12:21.451 --> 12:31.183
you have a personal budget during those years, 
those pre-war years, of how much spending money

12:21.451 --> 12:31.183
you had or anything? Well, I

12:31.203 --> 12:37.750
remember we didn't have very much. I got a job and 
was working on a campus at 25 cents an hour. We'd get

12:43.377 --> 12:44.278
paid for that. When I became a junior and went under 
contract, We got $100 a semester, I think it was, or

12:48.890 --> 12:55.321
maybe it was $25 a month, I'm not sure. But that was 
what our spending money was. As

13:01.071 --> 13:14.914
your years went on, events in Europe and Asia began 
to be much more important When did you and your

13:16.683 --> 13:24.573
friends start talking about what might be the 
result of those events in Europe and Asia? Well, we

13:25.534 --> 13:34.344
didn't discuss the war too much in September of 
1941. We knew it was going on, but we didn't talk

13:34.645 --> 13:37.408
much about it. And on December the 7th, I had gone on 
Saturday the 6th, had gone to Huntsville with a

13:38.468 --> 13:52.144
couple of fellows that had a car, and they had 
arranged dates, and I had a date with a girl. I went

13:52.264 --> 14:05.539
to the, for Sunday, we went to the movie, and when we 
came back, they went up, a couple of the women went

13:52.264 --> 14:05.539
up to their room and got some records, because in 
the the lounge there in a women's dormitory, they

14:07.308 --> 14:14.720
had a radio and a record player, and we were going to 
play records and dance a little bit and then go

14:07.308 --> 14:14.720
home. And they came on the radio then, and Pearl 
Harbor had been bombed. And then somehow,

14:20.028 --> 14:30.826
somebody got the announcement that all A&M cadets 
report back to the campus immediately. I don't

14:30.846 --> 14:32.248
know how that got on air. Well, boy, we took off. I 
got back on the campus and the freshmen were

14:35.793 --> 14:47.864
walking guard duty with brooms and they're 
shooting the sophomores as spies and the campus

14:35.793 --> 14:47.864
was just in upheaval on that Sunday night. Monday 
morning, when we started to go to class, I had a

14:49.085 --> 14:59.514
portable radio which was about a foot long and you 
had to plug it in.

15:02.617 --> 15:05.800
And I thought I'd take that to class and we could 
listen to the news. And I walked into class and was

15:06.016 --> 15:11.163
going to plug it in, and the prof said, well, I 
haven't got time for that. The war is going to be

15:11.183 --> 15:13.906
over before this semester is over. You're not 
going to just forget about that war. You don't know

15:17.531 --> 15:18.652
who that prof was? No, I wish I could remember who he 
was, because nobody could have been wronger, of

15:18.732 --> 15:23.438
course. So that's your military science teacher, 
which Major Bacher was the one that was teaching

15:23.538 --> 15:30.487
you military science. No, that wasn't him. So you 
didn't get to hear President Roosevelt's speech

15:32.003 --> 15:38.474
to the Joint Session of Congress? No, I got a record 
of it, but I didn't hear it. What did you and your

15:44.844 --> 15:48.450
friends then begin to think? Well, of course, a lot 
of them were wanting to enlist. This is in January

15:53.498 --> 15:58.787
and so on. And we played in the Cotton Bowl that year 
and played Fordham. But the people at school, the

16:05.740 --> 16:13.847
military science teachers and all of the 
professors and all were urging us not to enlist.

16:14.648 --> 16:21.815
And of course, as soon as you became eligible for a 
contract, you had to join the ERC, enlisted

16:14.648 --> 16:21.815
reserve corps. And that was trial and error. There 
were an awful lot of them that left A&M, and they

16:27.320 --> 16:33.674
just couldn't wait to get into the war. And, of 
course, the class of 43 that graduated, we went

16:34.496 --> 16:44.539
through the trimester, and I'm trying to remember 
when that was. Now, your class year is what? You

16:48.599 --> 16:50.782
were class 44. Because I didn't graduate in 44. No, 
no, I understand. But we went through the

16:53.805 --> 17:13.909
trimester thing, and I want to say that we started 
it in the summer of 43

16:53.805 --> 17:13.909
because I know in the fall I could wear my boots as a 
senior. And we had three regular semesters. They

17:17.692 --> 17:19.354
weren't like summer school. And because of the 
war, there were a number of changes made in the

17:21.096 --> 17:25.803
Corps. First thing that, excuse me. Did the Corps 
become more serious? Yeah, it was always pretty

17:32.031 --> 17:34.254
serious. The seniors ran the outfits, the juniors 
were the NCOs, the sophomores were the corporals

17:35.735 --> 17:44.627
if there was enough stripes to go around. But

17:45.485 --> 17:59.545
the first thing that happened when I was a junior, 
up until that point, seniors and juniors wore

17:45.485 --> 17:59.545
cuffs on their long trousers. Well, they took the 
cuffs away when I became a junior, and I never got to

18:01.048 --> 18:05.053
wear cuffs. And seniors wore a Sam Brown belt and a 
long blue coat and boots. Well, I got to be a senior,

18:16.383 --> 18:20.632
and I'd already bought a pair of secondhand boots. 
They did away with boots and the sand brown and the

18:20.652 --> 18:25.202
saber. That wasn't in the Army, so they gave us 
blouses with a cloth belt on it. But I wore those

18:33.399 --> 18:35.083
boots. When I'd leave the campus, I'd put on white 
coveralls. That was all fatigues, was white

18:38.111 --> 18:40.032
coveralls. I'd get out on the road, and I'd get away 
from the campus and take them off, and I'd

18:40.473 --> 18:48.900
hitchhike.

18:50.281 --> 18:55.286
You leave A&M when? Well, let's see. The class of 44 
and 45 all went in at the same time, and I guess that

18:57.788 --> 19:03.433
must have been

19:09.252 --> 19:19.343
In 43,

19:09.252 --> 19:19.343
I think it was, we had three reviews. 44 took them 
around, 45 took them around, 46 took them around.

19:25.690 --> 19:27.952
And when the last group came around, they were just 
squads. Did you and your friends ever lie awake at

19:28.773 --> 19:38.584
night talking about where you might be sent, what 
it might how your life might be affected? Well, we

19:41.922 --> 19:49.333
all, we talked about what we, you know, what we, of 
course, see, my group all had to go to OCS. And we

19:50.214 --> 19:54.500
wondered sometimes how, you know, how that was 
going to be. And, yeah, we wondered about where we

19:54.540 --> 19:59.568
were going to go and what the war was going to be. And 
Dolores and I talk about it, and she was worried,

19:59.588 --> 20:05.837
too, even though we weren't married at that time. 
Well, you went to Mineral Wells when you were

20:06.509 --> 20:09.412
inducted there. Yeah, I went to Mineral Wells. So 
you were at Camp Walters, you were inducted. Yeah,

20:14.716 --> 20:16.178
and then came back to A&M. Oh. And how long? The 
whole outfit was private. They put you in ASTP. And

20:23.464 --> 20:28.769
how long were you here in the ASTP? Well, we were in 
there until the end of that semester. Then we went

20:33.373 --> 20:36.516
to... My group went to San Antonio, Fort Sam 
Houston. From there, they broke us down and I wound

20:41.551 --> 20:47.097
up at Fort Sill, Oklahoma, because I was in the 
artillery. And I didn't go to OCS. I went to a

20:48.358 --> 20:51.701
battery survey school. Then they sent us back to 
A&M, and that's when we was in the ASTP. So now this

20:56.486 --> 21:07.937
was in

20:56.486 --> 21:07.937
the late 43 or the early part of 44, I guess, because 
we left here. and went to OCS at Fort Sill,

21:08.407 --> 21:11.330
Oklahoma. Second week I was there, my class and the 
class behind me were taking out, and some of us went

21:12.271 --> 21:21.882
to infantry and some went to armor. I started 
infantry OCS on D-Day, 1944. How well did A&M

21:30.432 --> 21:34.937
prepare you for duty? Very well, very well. We knew 
two things. We knew how to study, and we at least

21:40.895 --> 21:47.142
knew a right foot from a left foot, and we could 
march. And if we got in charge of a group, we could

21:47.883 --> 21:51.628
move them from one place to the other. And we knew 
about weapons to a degree. And we were used to being

21:56.915 --> 22:05.886
with people and close with people. that a lot of 
guys in the Army had a little trouble with. So that,

22:11.272 --> 22:19.046
we got married before I went to, when I went up to 
Ford's Hill, didn't I? They got married at the,

22:24.462 --> 22:29.306
Methodist Parsons in College Station, and I got a 
three-day pass.

22:32.149 --> 22:35.912
We spent our honeymoon in the LaSalle Hotel, and 
then I had to move out of that. She stayed over here

22:35.932 --> 22:38.014
as long as I was here. Moved into Aggieland Inn, 
didn't I? Yeah, out of the room. Before I could get

22:44.961 --> 22:50.446
to Fort Sill, you were sent to Fort Benning. While 
you were on active duty, do you think officers from

22:54.449 --> 22:59.414
other places had a respect for A&M people? All 
except, we call them the ring knockers, the guys

23:01.956 --> 23:08.062
from West Point. They would always, they'd kind of 
look down and, oh, any ROTC thing. Oh, I see. But a

23:13.988 --> 23:23.177
lot of the others that came, see, they had ROTC, but 
they didn't have the core like we had it. And, uh,

23:25.010 --> 23:27.213
Yeah, they had respect for it. And, of course, we'd 
always see an officer when we were in OCS and

23:27.233 --> 23:37.326
before, and then even after we got commissioned to 
see if they wore an Aggie ring. You weren't yet a

23:38.728 --> 23:39.909
senior. You didn't have a ring when you left, or did 
you? Yes. Oh, you did. Got a ring. Do you remember

23:45.436 --> 23:52.205
any anecdotes about somebody spotting your ring 
while you were on active duty? Oh, yes. I can

23:54.608 --> 23:58.214
remember, you know, are you an Aggie? What class 
are you? And we'd go through that.

24:05.365 --> 24:07.248
We got a ring and it cost me $50 then. And it was the 
first ones that Bob Ford made that had a curved

24:07.368 --> 24:13.618
crown. It had too much gold in it, it wore off. Tell 
us about the Aggies. They were standing on the

24:19.126 --> 24:21.510
street corner Oh, well, I'm coming to that. And she 
can tell you about an Aggie that picked her up when

24:24.834 --> 24:29.981
she was coming to California to see me. We were at 
the Camp Van Dorn. Van Dorn? It was at, what was the

24:36.951 --> 24:39.995
camp at Hattiesburg? Shelby. Shelby at 
Hattiesburg. And I was in the 49th Infantry, 149th

24:43.180 --> 24:47.886
Infantry Regiment. And it was muster. So my 
roommate, Dick Phillips, and I decided we might

24:52.366 --> 24:59.260
just kind of get together. And so Dolores and I had 
gone into town, into town, into downtown

25:00.343 --> 25:06.415
Hattiesburg. and was walking down the street. I 
was going to buy some socks, and we were going to go

25:08.865 --> 25:20.542
to the grocery store, and a guy walks up to me and 
slaps me on the shoulder, and he said, is that an

25:08.865 --> 25:20.542
Aggie ring? And I said, yes, it is, and he showed me 
his ring, and that was Ed Glazner, wasn't it? It was

25:28.074 --> 25:28.895
Emmett McLarty. McLarty. He said, I'd always been 
told if you stood on a street corner anywhere in the

25:30.087 --> 25:36.312
world long enough, an Aggie would walk by. My 
friend over across the street, he's waiting over

25:36.733 --> 25:43.219
there, and he waited to come over. They said, 
where's the muster? I said, as far as I know, my

25:45.601 --> 25:49.444
roommate and I are the only two Aggies on the post. 
So I said, we'll just have a dinner at our house, and

25:50.625 --> 25:58.592
we'll have a muster at our house. And this was 
before the days where they had candles and some of

25:59.281 --> 26:02.749
that. But they said, well, we've got some stamps 
for meat. So we went to the market, and Dolores

26:08.182 --> 26:12.091
bought, what was it, did you buy a roast or steak? 
Steaks. Steaks. Now, we've got a room... Dolores

26:18.097 --> 26:19.999
was real smart about this. She always said, you can 
live just as cheap in the silk stocking area as you

26:20.019 --> 26:27.027
can in the slums if you're going to rent a room. So 
she had gone in the best area of Hattiesburg. I'll

26:33.974 --> 26:36.757
tell you the story about that woman. Well, I went 
down the street, and the biggest house, the finest

26:38.399 --> 26:45.466
house I saw rang the doorbell. And this woman comes 
to the door. And she, we got to talking, and she

26:47.459 --> 26:53.486
said, you're a southerner, aren't you? And I said, 
yes, I am. I'm from Texas. Well, she pulled me

26:56.570 --> 26:58.612
inside. They just treated us like we were one of 
theirs. We had a room and a bath, and we had

27:02.597 --> 27:06.261
privileges to the whole house. And to the kitchen, 
probably. So Emmett McLarty and Everett Glazner

27:09.144 --> 27:13.449
thought that... So we had the dinner, and... They 
thought that was my house. They'd go home and

27:19.408 --> 27:23.874
they'd tell their wives that they had met this rich 
Aggie. And they never invited us to their home. We

27:25.857 --> 27:33.829
found out 25 years later that the reason they never 
had had the then was because they thought their

27:25.857 --> 27:33.829
houses were so crummy. And I said, oh Lord, we just 
had a roof. Back to Muster. Do you remember going to

27:38.817 --> 27:44.365
Muster on campus before you left for the service? 
No. So that muster began to mean something to you

27:46.999 --> 27:53.166
when you were away. Yeah, yeah. I just don't 
remember a muster on campus. I haven't talked to

28:00.895 --> 28:06.843
many people who do remember pre-World War II 
musters. That's right. But it started during the

28:07.323 --> 28:08.985
war. Most of them say, I think maybe muster was 
held, but I'm not sure on campus. And yet they held a

28:15.108 --> 28:19.333
muster on Corregidor just before it fell in 1942. 
We had one on Okinawa, because I was there on the

28:19.433 --> 28:27.402
21st, and they had them all over. Let's go back just 
a second on muster and other. Midnight yell

28:34.271 --> 28:38.035
practice before the war, were there midnight yell 
practices? Yes. Where were they described? All

28:41.652 --> 28:56.026
Yale practice started out on the steps of the Y, and 
we got to the big, that they moved it over to the

28:41.652 --> 28:56.026
steps on Goodman Hall that faced the Koch 
building. The entrance to the Goodman. Mitchell

28:59.689 --> 29:01.531
was a dormitory on the other side. They tore it 
down. And we had it there, and the band and all came,

29:04.774 --> 29:10.680
and midnight Yale practice was People came in 
uniforms and a bonfire uniform. And as I told you,

29:16.204 --> 29:24.614
if we had a date and there was a dance, the gals came 
in their long dresses. And they had some, the yard

29:24.634 --> 29:33.124
leaders all had little stories to tell, but they 
were, I mean, way milder than what you hear now.

29:36.564 --> 29:40.110
There was very little vulgarity. Maybe they were 
to hell or damn, but that was about it. All right.

29:46.219 --> 29:46.800
Bonfire. Describe pre-World War II bonfires. 
Well, the first one I went to was across the street

29:50.506 --> 30:00.141
on the drill field from Law and Puryear.

30:01.471 --> 30:16.274
Southern Pacific and Missouri Pacific Railroad 
would always bring in, before Thanksgiving,

30:01.471 --> 30:16.274
they'd bring in extra baggage carts, which were 
four-wheeled carts with a tongue on it, because

30:01.471 --> 30:16.274
they knew we were going to come down there and get 
them. And so after they began to bring them in, we'd

30:16.314 --> 30:21.743
always leave one so the train could have it. And 
that's how we hauled stuff to the bonfire. It was

30:25.552 --> 30:28.558
really almost like a big trash fire. And, of 
course, we had anywhere, most I ever remember, I

30:28.578 --> 30:38.259
think, was four outhouses, but maybe two to four 
outhouses on there. And you could set it on fire

30:39.060 --> 30:41.245
pretty easy. And, of course, the cavalry lived in 
Long Perrier. and they had an old claxton. If they

30:46.076 --> 30:51.465
thought somebody was coming in and they drank that 
claxton boy, they'd fall out of there anyway. Now,

30:52.126 --> 30:56.233
Art, so the bonfire basically was trash. Well, it 
was just scrub lumber and trees. But it wasn't all

31:01.141 --> 31:02.724
tree trunks. No. And where did the outhouses come 
from? wherever we could get them. And of course,

31:07.487 --> 31:12.045
they always, we tried because the university 
would have to build them a new one. Most of the time

31:12.065 --> 31:14.897
it was from some, I guess,
