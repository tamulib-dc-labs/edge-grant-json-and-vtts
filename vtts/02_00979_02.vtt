00:04.351 --> 00:18.464
Yes, we had, like I say, the congressmen and the 
people that control the purse strings telling the

00:04.351 --> 00:18.464
military that they had to conduct a war a certain 
way. If you're going to win a war, you've got to do

00:18.484 --> 00:26.251
whatever means are available to you to win that 
war. In Vietnam, the Viet Cong and the North

00:26.751 --> 00:33.177
Vietnamese Army, once they found that they were 
being defeated, they would retreat into either

00:34.490 --> 00:40.276
Cambodia or north of Vietnam. The U.S. military 
did not have the authority to attack them in these

00:41.438 --> 00:50.488
places. Once they retreated, they could not be 
followed. Once they retreated, they couldn't be

00:53.131 --> 00:54.953
bombed. We were, and when I say we, I'm talking 
about the Congress and a lot of your general public

01:05.860 --> 01:14.514
wanted to fight a war with world opinion on our 
side. We were not allowed to bomb North Vietnam,

01:14.614 --> 01:22.466
even though Hanoi was at different times bombed. 
This could only be done on certain times. What I'm

01:30.413 --> 01:36.741
saying is the military was trying to fight a war 
with one hand tied behind its back. The military

01:36.761 --> 01:44.391
takes their professionalism serious. However, 
when their authority is questioned daily, their

01:44.411 --> 01:51.940
ability to conduct a war becomes very, very 
limited. That is one of the reasons that we lost the

01:51.960 --> 01:59.610
war and more than likely A large percentage of the 
reasons. Another reason that I feel that

02:05.428 --> 02:22.037
contributed significantly

02:05.428 --> 02:22.037
to the

02:05.428 --> 02:22.037
losing the war effort was the general soldier's 
attitude towards the war, even though I've

02:23.637 --> 02:39.020
mentioned on several occasions that the average 
soldier going over there was a volunteer, and he

02:23.637 --> 02:39.020
did it because it was a thing to do. He did it for 
professional reasons. The military afforded him

02:43.187 --> 02:52.581
the opportunity to lose a lot of that sense of 
professionalism.

02:54.046 --> 02:59.815
in Vietnam, as opposed to World War Two, where a 
person would go for the duration of the war. In

03:00.897 --> 03:09.731
Vietnam, the soldier was sent over for a 12 month 
period of time on a tour. The majority of us went

03:12.828 --> 03:18.117
over with the impression that we're going to be 
there for one year. We are going to become back

03:20.260 --> 03:28.794
after a year because it never entered our mind that 
we were going over there to be killed. We knew that

03:29.656 --> 03:32.841
we were going over there to fight a war. Some even 
anticipated going over there to war. They looked

03:37.128 --> 03:49.079
forward to it, not really knowing what they were 
going to encounter other than maybe what they saw

03:37.128 --> 03:49.079
in the movies or on television.

03:49.820 --> 03:54.504
And again, it was one of those things where they 
were not going to be the ones killed. It was always

03:54.564 --> 03:59.269
going to happen to somebody else.

04:00.470 --> 04:04.654
We went over there with the impression anyhow that 
we were going to be over there for a year. And we

04:06.845 --> 04:10.974
weren't very professional about it. Every 
soldier, or a great number of soldiers, would go

04:12.036 --> 04:20.014
out and get drunk just about every night. Beer was 
prevalent in Vietnam. wasn't available in the

04:23.787 --> 04:34.487
economy, the military made great effort to bring 
beer out to the soldiers, even close to the war

04:23.787 --> 04:34.487
zone. I think I can honestly say that the beer 
itself was not brought out to the battle line.

04:41.139 --> 04:43.483
However, war was not being fought 24 hours a day, 
365 days a year. It was being fought during short

04:47.612 --> 05:00.224
periods of time where, after the battle, the 
soldier would return to a garrison environment.

05:02.667 --> 05:12.677
The garrison environment had a lot of beer in it, 
either right there in the military compound or off

05:02.667 --> 05:12.677
the military compound. Whenever a soldier, a 
person, drains excessively and suffers from a

05:13.332 --> 05:34.412
withdrawal, a hangover,

05:13.332 --> 05:34.412
his proficiency, his sufficiency is going to 
diminish. Consequently, I think that drugs, even

05:34.865 --> 05:43.153
though, like I mentioned, during my period of 
time, the hard drugs were not there. However, they

05:43.173 --> 05:51.742
were prevalent throughout the latter half of the 
Vietnam War. I think that drugs had a big thing to do

05:52.583 --> 06:01.212
about losing the war.

06:01.712 --> 06:04.635
Also of major significance, I think, was the lack 
of respect

06:06.050 --> 06:16.104
that we got from the Vietnamese. Like I mentioned, 
this was a guerrilla type of a war. If you're going

06:21.172 --> 06:29.003
to win a war like that, you have to have the general 
populace the indigent support. If you do not have

06:33.795 --> 06:38.642
their support, then you might as well pack it up and 
go home. We did not respect the Vietnamese. We

06:43.629 --> 06:45.091
didn't like the Vietnamese. I am sure that they did 
not respect us. More than likely, they didn't like

06:49.697 --> 06:51.580
us. They liked our money, but they did not support 
us. They had a bigger propaganda effort They had a

07:00.472 --> 07:09.429
public figure, Ho Chi Minh, who they all respected

07:00.472 --> 07:09.429
to look up to. We could provide them with nothing. 
Even their elected, and they were not elected,

07:13.576 --> 07:22.513
even their government was not well liked. So 
consequently, when we did not receive the public

07:23.523 --> 07:39.841
support, the Viet Cong found it easy, and so did the 
North Vietnamese Army, to hide within the general

07:23.523 --> 07:39.841
populace. The general population did not provide 
us with the information because they supported

07:40.082 --> 07:50.273
the opposing side. This had a big thing to do with us 
losing the war. Those three things are the

07:57.488 --> 08:17.577
military having to fight a war with one hand tied 
behind their back, the drugs, and the lack of

07:57.488 --> 08:17.577
support by the local, national, of the Republic of 
Vietnam. I'd like to thank you for sharing your

08:19.987 --> 08:22.951
experiences with me. In closing, would you like to 
add any remarks? Only that I'd like to say that what

08:28.659 --> 08:48.728
I have said is things that I have, are personal 
experiences that my thoughts do not necessarily

08:28.659 --> 08:48.728
are

08:28.659 --> 08:48.728
the thoughts of any other person. These are things 
that I picked up from personal experience that I

08:52.220 --> 08:58.607
picked up from my observations.

08:59.748 --> 09:13.382
I want to thank you for letting me conduct this 
interview and I hope that we do not have to suffer

08:59.748 --> 09:13.382
one of these experiences again. Thank you.
