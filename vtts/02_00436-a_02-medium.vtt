WEBVTT

00:02.798 --> 00:06.421
Okay, reading from my actual log book here. On the 
20th of December, that's up at Kunming, I would add

00:07.962 --> 00:20.513
it to you,

00:07.962 --> 00:20.513
shot down eight out of ten Jap bombers.

00:26.558 --> 00:32.063
And that was a one hour and 30 minute flight, by the 
way, including the scramble time and all. And

00:32.819 --> 00:39.610
that's the one where the intelligence said the 
other two never did get across the border. And to

00:39.630 --> 00:42.895
your credit, there were two kills? Yes. They paid 
me for two on that flight, yeah. Now, the 26th of

00:49.045 --> 01:00.143
January,

00:49.045 --> 01:00.143
I sure as shot down three Jap I-97 fighters in a 
45-minute flight. Then it wasn't the 29th of

01:01.490 --> 01:04.578
January like we've been saying. It was the 26th of 
January. 26. You shot down three over Rangoon.

01:10.612 --> 01:10.793
Yeah. Okay, we'll get that right on the tape.

01:26.819 --> 01:30.423
25th of February shot down one Jap I-97. Okay well 
let's talk about that one then. That's your that's

01:33.046 --> 01:35.769
your next combat success. 25th of February 1942, 
where were you? Oh

01:41.055 --> 01:46.821
wait a minute. 26th January 1942, shot down three 
Jap I-97 fighters. Now that's the one we were

01:52.248 --> 01:53.709
talking about. Yeah we just I've got down three, 
and in my diary I said two. Yeah. You better fix that

01:58.555 --> 01:59.777
in your diary. I think I said two in one probable. 
Isn't that what I said? In the diary, you said two in

02:03.444 --> 02:05.808
one probable. In your logbook, you say three. 
Yeah. In this logbook, right. You see, that's the

02:10.898 --> 02:12.942
reason I had to edit this.

02:24.498 --> 02:31.209
Now we're talking about the next combat victory 
mission that you had, the 25th of February, 1942.

02:32.190 --> 02:33.392
And where were you at this time? At Rangoon. And 
you'd been flying missions throughout the time

02:36.337 --> 02:49.058
from the 26th of January to the 25th of February, 
but this is the next kill that you had. Yeah, yeah.

02:58.737 --> 03:08.674
Would you describe

02:58.737 --> 03:08.674
that? About this time, I caught sight of a Jap 
formation. Neil came on the radio, come on over

03:15.325 --> 03:17.849
here, here they are. I thought to myself, where in 
the hell is here? And started in on the bombers I

03:21.074 --> 03:23.378
saw. There were 14 in perfect V formation. 
Suddenly I caught sight of that usual cluster

03:26.063 --> 03:32.012
formation of Japanese fighters directly above 
the bombers and changed my mind. I had to get some

03:33.614 --> 03:35.036
altitude speed. I ended up making my first attempt 
on the fighters, and this one was head on. He caught

03:39.202 --> 03:42.808
fire before I closed in to the point where I had to 
pull up to miss him. I looked for another and

03:42.988 --> 03:48.576
reached up with a pad on the charging handle of a .50 
caliber gun." I had a tendency to do that every time

03:48.596 --> 03:53.483
I would knock a fighter down. Pat the gun. And so you 
were coming straight in on this one, and he was

03:57.248 --> 04:01.293
coming straight in at you. A lot of times this 
happened. And you hit him? Yeah. He didn't hit you?

04:10.384 --> 04:11.185
No. Again, I ended up in a head-on attack. They were 
equally as aggressive as we were. We headed

04:17.012 --> 04:20.497
straight at each other, each with all our guns 
blazing. At what... It seemed to be the last second

04:22.032 --> 04:27.158
he pulled up, and I had decided to do the same thing 
at the same time. This is the one I was telling you

04:27.358 --> 04:29.380
about a while ago. Oh, okay. It is more natural, 
G-force-wise, to pull up than to push over. I

04:35.247 --> 04:40.373
reacted, it seemed, unconsciously, as I shoved 
forward on a stick violently. As tight as my

04:40.393 --> 04:44.918
seatbelt was, and boy, did we put him tight in 
expectation of combat. My head hit the top of my

04:44.938 --> 04:46.680
canopy. We shot past each other, him above me. I 
rolled and pulled violently to the left,

04:49.370 --> 04:53.455
straining my head over backwards to pick him up. 
He, too, was inflamed. Yow! Two in less than three

04:56.379 --> 04:58.381
minutes. Now, this is, see how I'm getting them 
mixed up? This is the next day. Yeah. Now, this is

05:03.688 --> 05:07.092
the 25th of February I'm reading from. Well, your 
logbook says the 26th of February. The 25th of

05:10.557 --> 05:11.478
February. That's for one. Oh, yeah. The 26th. Two, 
yeah. Two. You've got some work to do on that. Well,

05:20.678 --> 05:22.280
this is the first time I've put it together.

05:25.965 --> 05:30.551
I typed this for the first time out of my original 
diary.

05:34.997 --> 05:38.902
Well, that describes some of the combat anyhow, 
whether my days are right or not. So the 25th of

05:39.102 --> 05:41.505
February, you shot down one. The 26th of February, 
you shot down two more. Yeah.

05:58.287 --> 06:00.109
Which brings us up to a total of eight. Right, and 
there it is, Detroit 8 airplane. On March 1942,

06:03.592 --> 06:07.636
before the strafing attack on Chiang Mai. Now this 
is after we had evacuated from Rangoon. So you

06:13.002 --> 06:14.964
left, when did you leave Rangoon? Right after the 
26th of February? Did I say 27th? 27th. At 27th. You

06:22.571 --> 06:23.552
left Rangoon. On the 27th, and landed and operated 
out of Magwe, M-A-G-W-E, Burma, on the 28th of

06:23.752 --> 06:30.819
February. Okay,

06:31.900 --> 06:39.428
so you went up to Burma, and how are the conditions 
there? This is where you begin to see the usual

06:40.569 --> 06:49.759
pandemonium and mix-up of war front, 
particularly when you're losing and retreating.

06:55.960 --> 07:06.971
The Japanese were pushing up from Singapore, up 
the peninsula, come across into Rangoon, Burma,

06:55.960 --> 07:06.971
and taking over that base, and they were pushing up 
north towards China. And see, we were evacuating

07:07.491 --> 07:12.316
north up to Irrawaddy River.

07:13.797 --> 07:15.599
That's Mogwe right there. Here is Rangoon, Mogwe. 
No, wait a minute. No, it's up here. Right up here.

07:23.748 --> 07:23.888
OK. This is Mogli right here. That's Tangu.

07:33.240 --> 07:33.681
OK. But it's right in this area. Yeah. OK. How did 
you get them? Could you describe the conditions of

07:40.349 --> 07:43.273
Mogli? The remnants of the RAF air base. and

07:48.667 --> 07:57.739
strictly RAF, the remnants of what had escaped 
from Singapore. And they had a shambles of a light

07:58.941 --> 08:10.256
bomber Blenheim outfit remaining, five or six 
airplanes. They had a couple of old Lysander

08:12.865 --> 08:20.175
observation airplanes, which were practically 
useless for observation and photo

08:12.865 --> 08:20.175
reconnaissance, if you will. And they had about 
four or five hurricanes. And they were hoping for

08:23.800 --> 08:29.107
reinforcements immediately from India, you 
know, to come across. And, of course, they were

08:30.148 --> 08:37.338
delighted for us to stay with them because we were, 
you know, still fighting for them. You began to see

08:37.358 --> 08:42.585
refugees, you know, and that's the thing that you 
remember so well. that shows the effects of war on a

08:43.088 --> 08:46.251
countryside. Peasants with what belongings they 
have left and carts drawn by oxen or Indian water

08:47.573 --> 08:55.061
buffalo. Some wealthy people apparently and a 
nice little foreign car, Japanese automobile.

09:03.050 --> 09:05.873
And the city just overflown. We had, the only place 
we had at Montgomery was tents. The British put up

09:11.279 --> 09:16.405
some tents for us, because they didn't have 
anything else. And if I remember correctly, we

09:16.425 --> 09:22.211
had, I think we had about six airplanes. We had to 
leave one airplane at random, we couldn't get out.

09:29.620 --> 09:31.962
And because we had robbed it before to get the 
others out. I think we had about six airplanes. Of

09:36.413 --> 09:39.336
course, six pilots were flying, including me and 
Bob Neal. Incidentally, two of the boys got lost on

09:39.356 --> 09:43.381
the way up because of sandstorms. Again, no 
navigation aid. But fortunately, they found open

09:46.464 --> 09:51.610
field where they could land, and we got those 
airplanes back. So you only left with six, and you

09:52.191 --> 09:55.535
went down there with, what, 12? Well, you know, we 
had airplanes going back and replaced with parts.

09:59.319 --> 10:02.202
We lost training-wise. several airplanes in 
Rangoon. But actual combat, in actual combat, if I

10:05.445 --> 10:14.473
can remember correctly, I think we lost, in actual 
combat, eight pilots. At Rangoon or the whole

10:16.435 --> 10:18.137
time? No, throughout the entire AVG history. Wow. 
And now, we lost more airplanes than that because,

10:20.899 --> 10:27.304
see, the pilots bailed out. I bailed out of an 
airplane once, see, and I'm still there. So we lost

10:30.567 --> 10:32.509
more airplanes than that. We eventually got our 
100 airplane, just about the time I left 42, and I

10:32.962 --> 10:41.233
helped ferry some of them, the P-40E. But let's get 
back to the conditions now. The people were

10:44.137 --> 10:54.131
crowding into the cities, and how about you slept 
in tents, and that was it. How about the bugs? I

10:57.456 --> 11:00.279
never remember any bad bugs until China. About a 
quarter of them were in China. We really got in a

11:02.695 --> 11:04.076
mess of those. Mosquitoes? I don't remember 
mosquitoes bothering us. I remember at Mogwe, the

11:08.280 --> 11:11.963
tents weren't too bad. It was cool. Hot in the day, 
so you want to be cool at night. I don't ever

11:17.148 --> 11:20.051
remember mosquitoes bothering us anyplace. Were 
you on the floor or on the couch? No, we were in the

11:22.633 --> 11:23.374
couch. And we had mosquito nets, too. In fact, one 
of the main things in Burma was mosquito nets.

11:29.139 --> 11:32.162
Never anything bothered me except some ants got on 
me one time. I think it was because I had some sweets

11:32.328 --> 11:38.717
nutting hair oil on my hair. I woke up with them all 
over my head.

11:43.604 --> 11:46.248
Bed bugs, definitely in Ling Ling, China. A gift 
store came home in August. I was practically eaten

11:48.591 --> 11:50.113
alive with those. Plus bed, I was fed some tongue 
oil, you know, tongue nut. You make paint oil out of

11:56.803 --> 11:59.787
it, mixed with paint. I'm getting ahead of myself, 
but the Chinese went down and bought that instead

12:00.357 --> 12:05.722
of cooking oil to cook their fish in. And the whole 
outfit got sick, including Johnny Allison, who

12:05.742 --> 12:12.229
we're just going to continue doing. At Ma Gui, we 
ate at the British Mess, and this was getting

12:12.489 --> 12:16.713
pretty sparse then. I remember having beer and 
toast for breakfast several times. That's all.

12:21.518 --> 12:22.479
Beer and toast? Hot beer and toast. Why hot beer? 
Well, that was all I had. Didn't have any ice. I

12:29.095 --> 12:35.062
don't remember any decent coffee at all in Burma. 
In China, we got some better coffee, but I didn't

12:35.542 --> 12:40.648
get good coffee until I came back to India. Who was 
supplying you? RAF at that time. The RAF was

12:43.872 --> 12:46.675
supplying you. Was Chenault with you? No, 
Chenault was still up in China. We were

12:51.607 --> 12:56.795
communicating with him through British 
communications, RAF. They kept a link with him,

12:56.815 --> 12:59.119
actually. And radio teletype. How many squadrons 
did he have? He still had three. We always had

13:04.868 --> 13:05.889
three. I know you always had three, but how many 
were with him in China? Two. Two, and you were down

13:11.578 --> 13:13.441
there on your own. He had the what? We weren't 
engaged in any fighting in China at the time

13:16.463 --> 13:21.729
because of the Burma campaign. And he was using the 
reserve forces up at Kunming to rotate and see the

13:21.989 --> 13:27.295
squadron. We were the last squadron to go down to 
Kunming. And I think it, I mean, Rangoon. And I

13:34.404 --> 13:41.712
think even while we were there, he even rotated a 
few aircraft, took some of our bummers and sent

13:34.404 --> 13:41.712
some better ones. maintained one to us without 
rotating another squadron down he kept us there

13:41.995 --> 14:09.927
towards the end it mocked we finally he pulled all 
of us out and replaced us with about six more

13:41.995 --> 14:09.927
college and matter of fact he brought a whole 
squadron down at that time this will be

13:41.995 --> 14:09.927
interesting to you uh general

13:41.995 --> 14:09.927
the old ground pounder And General Fennel got in a 
horrible argument that went clear to the top

14:11.577 --> 14:28.092
between President Roosevelt and General 
Esselstyn about ground support for General

14:11.577 --> 14:28.092
Stillwell's troops.

14:30.654 --> 14:33.957
I had met General Stillwell once or twice. I 
actually sat under a wing of an airplane and talked

14:34.057 --> 14:36.820
with him. He was quite a dedicated old man. ground 
pounder type, if you will. Real dedicated old

14:43.403 --> 14:44.885
gentleman. He looked more like a, you pardon it, a 
college professor in English rather than a

14:45.205 --> 14:53.693
military. I'm glad I wasn't interested. No, I 
mean, he looked to be, John Stilwell, he looked to

14:57.117 --> 15:01.721
be then about 65. No kidding, yeah. He was lean and 
wore some old steel rim spectacles and had a burr

15:03.643 --> 15:10.930
cut haircut. skinny old skinny as a rail and wore 
typical ground pounder old uniform rag taggle

15:11.399 --> 15:41.170
type but more dedicated to his task and he was be 
damned that Burma if the Japs were going to run him

15:11.399 --> 15:41.170
out of Burma he would be damned if they did and he was 
trying to get all of our measly three squadrons if

15:11.399 --> 15:41.170
you will Chinese Air Force dedicated to nothing 
more of a ground support of him if his troops in the

15:41.335 --> 15:43.037
jungle. And of course, we weren't about to do that. 
Why not? Well, General Chenault knew better, and

15:48.064 --> 16:02.743
when it began to trickle down to the pilots that 
General Chenault might be losing this battle and

15:48.064 --> 16:02.743
we'd have to do it, this is one time that morale of 
the flying target began to get pretty low. You

16:04.685 --> 16:07.228
couldn't, you just can't visualize until you see 
it. Trying to support Well, it's sort of like the

16:09.567 --> 16:21.642
Vietnamese War, trying to support some, if you 
will, jungle fighters in the jungles that are so

16:09.567 --> 16:21.642
thick with trees that range anywhere from 100 feet 
to 200 feet high. No way to see them. Plus the fact

16:23.244 --> 16:32.895
that operate that low with a P-40 and no way to dive 
away should the Zeros come in and get on top of you,

16:23.244 --> 16:32.895
you're a dead duck. And we knew it. And boy, we 
just... One squadron was ready to... Throwing a

16:38.592 --> 16:43.837
towel had the Generalissimo, I had General 
Chennault do it. Had Stillwell. Had his way. So

16:47.119 --> 16:49.361
Chennault and Stillwell were arguing about this. 
Oh, violent enemies. They were worse than General

16:50.903 --> 16:55.066
Chennault and General Hepburn. But through

16:55.086 --> 17:07.097
the Gissimo, Generalissimo, General Chennault 
won his argument and said, no, first priority is

16:55.086 --> 17:07.097
still the air defense. And so none of us had to do. 
There were two or three missions flown on this, and

17:10.966 --> 17:15.911
boy, the pilots, they didn't like it at all. I never 
went on a mission like that, but I wouldn't have

17:16.331 --> 17:20.015
liked it either. How could you help them? I mean, 
how could you give them any support if you couldn't

17:22.077 --> 17:24.359
find them? That's it. It was worthless. It was 
absolutely worthless. Useless. And it was almost

17:28.143 --> 17:32.126
a suicide flight should a Japanese come over the 
interception. And what did you think of Stilwell?

17:35.069 --> 17:36.190
Well, that's the reason I didn't like him. Because 
he was being unreasonable. He was one of the older

17:39.383 --> 17:45.911
types, and I really don't think he understood air 
power. Plus the fact that at

17:45.931 --> 17:59.287
that time, just at the starting of the war, air 
power hadn't really made itself known. And

17:59.567 --> 18:06.295
I don't think he understood it at all.

18:07.608 --> 18:14.737
We would have done it had we been ordered to do it, 
but General Chenault, I'm sure, would have been

18:07.608 --> 18:14.737
the last man to agree with it. Now, when you were, 
you said before that you were sitting underneath

18:14.758 --> 18:19.544
an airplane with Stilwell. Tell me about that. I 
just had, he was waiting for a pilot in nearby

18:20.886 --> 18:26.393
Gutenberg to take him. It was one of these things, 
he'd been down to talk to Schmeltz, he'd been back

18:26.744 --> 18:35.697
at Chung King, and during his time he was talking 
about this fight that was going on. At that

18:35.997 --> 18:40.544
particular time I was sitting with him, I didn't 
know all this background. This was the early days

18:40.564 --> 18:43.067
of it. Like I told you, I gave my impression of him as 
an elderly old boy. He talked to me. Never asked me

18:52.445 --> 18:57.512
many questions about my combat experience or how 
you're doing or anything. I guess he was

18:57.813 --> 19:00.576
preoccupied with thought. I didn't, at that time, 
I'm not sure I realized really how big a man he was.

19:08.267 --> 19:21.726
But later on, later on, you know, knowing what I, 
learning what I did, that's

19:08.267 --> 19:21.726
the reason I have no respect for him. As a military, 
as an army commander, I'm sure that the old boy was

19:22.246 --> 19:37.242
dedicated, and he had his objective and had his 
job, but he was completely, to do what he wanted to

19:22.246 --> 19:37.242
do was completely unreasonable. No way. And it was 
not enough. Finally what happened was the Chinese

19:41.507 --> 19:49.215
stopped the Japanese at the northern reaches of 
Burma

19:52.790 --> 19:54.672
the Mekong River. The

19:55.573 --> 20:16.051
Chinese

19:55.573 --> 20:16.051
actually stopped them. They never did actually 
penetrate the southern border of China. Then the

20:20.416 --> 20:22.037
Japanese decided to come from the north down too. 
So Stilwell never did reject or eject the Japanese

20:23.689 --> 20:31.078
out of northern Burma. Eventually, they just 
withdrew because of higher priorities in other

20:31.478 --> 20:37.326
areas when they began to lose the war. But at any 
rate, Stilwell lost his battle with the old man,

20:39.709 --> 20:45.836
and we continue to do everything. OK. Now, how long 
were you at? Now, I

20:51.903 --> 21:06.805
and my bunch, the first squadron, we were replaced 
by one of the other squadrons, partially, and

20:51.903 --> 21:06.805
there were only six airplanes. We went on back up to 
Kunming. This was in early February, I believe.

21:13.515 --> 21:16.459
No, early March.

21:18.852 --> 21:34.611
The short after we left Magui, by the way, the base 
was real hard hit by the Japanese, and we lost, one

21:18.852 --> 21:34.611
pilot was killed on the ground, one of our pilots 
was killed on the ground from bombing, and we lost

21:18.852 --> 21:34.611
about two or three aircraft. And the British 
evacuated down, of course, so did we. Then we

21:39.497 --> 21:45.764
backed up clear into lower wing across, right 
across the river into southern China. And in

21:45.784 --> 21:46.665
effect, turn Burma over to the Japanese. Then we 
operated out of lower wing on the same type of

21:50.182 --> 21:52.886
mission. Were you disappointed about losing 
Burma?

22:01.138 --> 22:05.585
Looking back now, yeah, we were disappointed. It 
looked as though the Japanese were winning the

22:05.645 --> 22:07.989
war.

22:10.673 --> 22:13.056
We were being squeezed back up into China. As a 
matter of fact, at times we'd sit in bull sessions

22:16.936 --> 22:21.965
and figure at the end of our year's contract, say 
September, how in the world would we get out of

22:16.936 --> 22:21.965
China? The Japanese had the coast block, now they 
had the south block of Burma, and we dreamed up ways

22:22.686 --> 22:41.138
to go through the Himalayas some way back down 
through Afghanistan into India. course never

22:41.573 --> 22:43.075
turned out to be that way. Then of course they 
developed the, that's one reason they developed

22:43.095 --> 22:53.888
the hump route with air and even tried to build a 
Lido road across it to get supplies into China. And

22:54.689 --> 22:59.716
that's what generated the Chiang Mai raid. Chiang 
Mai, Thailand. Okay, that was, okay, that was your

23:01.918 --> 23:05.182
next major raid. For our squadron. I mean for you. 
Oh, for me, right. I'm not talking about—I'm

23:10.500 --> 23:14.005
talking about you. See, we drew the two squadrons 
back up into Kunming, and then eventually had to

23:14.105 --> 23:22.338
operate with one of them in Lower Wing, one in Lower 
Wing and two in Kunming. And then, you know, to get

23:22.358 --> 23:26.525
back into war, the old man dreamed up this mission. 
And when was this? Well, now that's—maybe it's

23:28.828 --> 23:31.653
helpful in this time. Yeah, I'm reflecting. Yes, 
Strait of Jaffa Aerodrome at Chiang Mai, 25th of

23:34.595 --> 23:37.679
March.

23:40.864 --> 23:44.869
25th of March.

23:44.889 --> 23:45.651
And where is that? Can you come in? Yeah, yeah. You 
know, strange as it is, I mean, it's

23:47.693 --> 23:55.625
coincidentally,

23:47.693 --> 23:55.625
subsequently we get to it. See, I was in the 
Southeast Asian War, like you were, and I was

23:55.645 --> 24:00.231
assigned Thailand. I was Deputy Commander of 
1312th Air Force. It, uh... Udorn, and I visited

24:05.797 --> 24:11.907
the detachment up at Chiang Mai, Thailand, the 
very air base that I hit, if I'm not kidding. That

24:11.947 --> 24:14.431
must have been fascinating.

24:25.368 --> 24:29.955
So it's north of Bangkok. Chiang Mai is the Summer 
capital, here we are, Chiang Mai. It's Chiang Mai.

24:38.334 --> 24:39.795
So it's close to the Burma border. Yeah, it's right 
across the Burma border.

24:44.781 --> 24:45.882
It's the Saline River. Northwest Thailand. 
Northwest Thailand, yeah. C-H-A-N-G-M-A-I.

24:52.809 --> 24:54.911
C-H-I-A-N-G. Oh, okay. Capital M-A-I. Chiang 
Mai, Thailand. We'll get that right.

25:01.163 --> 25:02.785
And that was on 25th of March. Tell me about that 
raid. Why did he want to dream this up? Wasn't air

25:06.550 --> 25:07.791
defense enough? Wasn't that enough of a chore? We 
couldn't get to the Japanese Air Force. They

25:13.619 --> 25:15.060
wouldn't come to Kunming anymore. They knew 
they'd lose everything they had. Lower Wing, they

25:17.724 --> 25:28.457
were taking Burma, so why come up at Lower Wing and 
suffer air defense missions and lose airplanes

25:17.724 --> 25:28.457
like they've been losing at Rangoon? So... We 
weren't engaging them. The old man began to get

25:32.307 --> 25:35.672
impatient, so we began to figure out how to... So 
for a month, you didn't have any contact with them?

25:38.336 --> 25:47.490
Well, at Lower Wing, yeah, they'd have, every once 
in a while, they'd mix up down there, and they

25:38.336 --> 25:47.490
knocked a few airplanes down in northern Burma, 
trying to attack them. But we up at Kunming didn't

25:47.971 --> 25:50.375
do a thing. We had to get a scare sometime and 
scramble. Well, we don't scramble, sure, but

25:54.321 --> 25:57.546
never did meet them. Well, the old man thought this 
mission at Chiang Mai, Thailand, he threw the

25:57.880 --> 26:09.356
intelligence, was the headquarters of the entire 
Southeastern Japanese Air Force, all Southeast

25:57.880 --> 26:09.356
Asia. And he knew that they were planning a hell of a 
big push to support the army in penetrating

26:09.897 --> 26:18.930
southern China. And they were massing their 
aircraft, primarily at Chiang Mai, Thailand.

26:24.658 --> 26:26.200
They get this through intelligence sources. So he 
called Bob Neal in and Jack Newkirk. I don't know if

26:31.707 --> 26:36.133
you ever heard of Jack Newkirk, but he was the 
commander of the second squadron at that time. Bob

26:36.494 --> 26:38.056
Neal was the commander of the first squadron. And 
sat down and discussed this plan he had that we were

26:39.338 --> 26:53.980
to take off with 14

26:39.338 --> 26:53.980
airplanes. Jack Newkirk would have four and, 
well, we were going to take 14 airplanes. He hadn't

27:00.933 --> 27:02.716
decided who would take them yet. And he was going to 
hit Chiang Mai, Thailand with a surprise dawn

27:02.736 --> 27:09.586
attack. Now mind you, some of these pilots that 
were flying these airplanes, P-40s, had never

27:09.606 --> 27:17.919
taken one off at night. We had one pilot in our 
squadron that was from the Navy And if I remember

27:25.951 --> 27:32.501
correctly, I don't think he ever flew a combat 
airplane at night, just a training airplane. But

27:32.521 --> 27:33.102
anyway. But did you have any fire planes? Wouldn't 
you need some bombers for this mission? Sure, but

27:40.013 --> 27:41.175
this was straight. We didn't have any bombers. 
This is the old man. The only way you could do it, we

27:43.799 --> 27:49.107
had to trace them. Did the P-40 take any bombs? 
Later on, we actually had desperation. We, as a

27:54.655 --> 27:57.840
matter of fact, killed two of our best pilots 
already. That's another story. Bob Little.

27:59.943 --> 28:00.444
Tremendous. Ace. Okay, so... See, that's all us 
supporting Stillwell again. You had no bombs on

28:06.873 --> 28:09.537
this mission? No. It's strictly strafing. Okay. 
And the way we planned this flight, we were to go

28:12.401 --> 28:23.177
over to Lower Wing, refuel, and looking at the map, 
you find low wing is just across the border from

28:23.765 --> 28:28.791
northern Burma, much closer to Chiang Mai. So 
you're going to refuel there the day before, sleep

28:28.811 --> 28:35.340
overnight, get up in the morning, and go at dawn. 
Refuel and get everything ready. Then late that

28:37.863 --> 28:51.240
evening, just before dusk, we would take off and 
fly to another little RAF base in northern,

28:37.863 --> 28:51.240
northeastern Burma, back up in a pocket to the 
eastern part of Burma and the north where the

28:52.233 --> 28:57.160
Japanese hadn't got to. There's no reason for them 
to even be in the area because there's no valuable

28:57.180 --> 29:00.804
economic... The railroad went due north through 
Lascio and Mo Wing along the Burma Road. But

29:04.589 --> 29:11.238
there's a little RAF base that's still held there 
in support for maybe reconnaissance or

29:04.589 --> 29:11.238
observation planes. It was right across the 
border from Thailand, very close to Chiang Mai.

29:15.424 --> 29:20.991
Well, we were going to slip in there just before...

29:21.865 --> 29:26.549
night so that, you know, Japanese, nobody would 
suspect us. Or if somebody did, they'd have less

29:26.870 --> 29:35.278
time to alert the Japanese for the planned dawn 
attack. Now, that's what we did, and it ended up

29:36.879 --> 29:50.472
where Bob Neal was picked by the old man, General 
Chenault, to command the mission, much to old Jack

29:36.879 --> 29:50.472
Newkirk's He was a very spirited type, fine guy, 
ex-Navy pilot. He had the second squadron. And I'm

29:59.065 --> 30:01.467
saying this for a particular reason. He was killed 
in the mission, but he became very downcast. He

30:06.312 --> 30:11.217
went along with it after the old man made the 
decision, but he would be the second in command.

30:12.178 --> 30:15.601
And furthermore, he would only take four 
airplanes out of his squadron. Bob Neal would take

30:16.141 --> 30:17.843
ten. I'm sorry, it would take six. There's going to 
be a total of ten aircraft. Bob Neal would take four

30:24.264 --> 30:28.090
for the attack and two for high cover. So a total of 
ten airplanes. And we had it all laid out where we'd

30:30.935 --> 30:36.865
go into this little, leave Namsang was the name of 
it. Let me get the

30:36.925 --> 30:43.216
name. Save your time, take it off me. It was a little 
forward RAF base in Namsang. We'd sleep in there at

30:48.367 --> 30:49.568
night. How do you spell that? N-A-M-S-A-N-G. If 
it's small, you can't find it. Really, all it is is a

30:54.635 --> 30:58.300
RAF little support base. So you'd sleep in there. 
Grass strip, about 2,000 feet long, with an

31:00.463 --> 31:09.855
operations building and one barracks.

31:13.520 --> 31:14.121
Did you do it? We are all recovered in there that 
night, 10 aircraft, 10 pilots, and no maintenance

31:14.270 --> 31:22.963
people. The RAF agreed to have some refueling 
crews there to help refuel the airplane the

31:22.983 --> 31:30.054
following day after recovery. So when the pilots 
got there, we parked our own airplanes, tied them

31:30.074 --> 31:35.582
down, and did everything necessary. The pilots 
did this. And by the time we got in there, it's just

31:37.285 --> 31:42.252
as dark. Then we went over to the, all ten of us, went 
over to the RAF barracks and the RAF gave us dinner

31:42.485 --> 31:53.746
and we turned in early. And I remember old Jack 
Newkirk, he, oh he was down, he wouldn't even

31:55.149 --> 32:05.067
matter of fact, he would hardly speak to anybody 
during dinner, but all of us were excited, you

32:05.249 --> 32:09.513
know, talking about it, and he was very 
down-to-date. The next, uh... Because he was

32:09.573 --> 32:11.495
second in command? Yeah, he was second, and then, 
uh... And he wanted to be first? Oh, yeah. Oh, I

32:15.038 --> 32:16.480
nearly killed him. He returned, uh, that's ironic 
when I say I nearly killed him. He was killed in the

32:22.625 --> 32:24.267
mission. Uh, he went to bed early. Well, uh, we went 
to bed, and the next morning, we got up real, way

32:26.049 --> 32:34.817
before daylight, and we ate, we got out, ready to 
take off. And we got there. OK. So

32:38.161 --> 32:49.534
they woke you at 4 o'clock in the morning? Yeah. And 
it was 525 before we were in a cockpit warming up the

32:50.895 --> 32:55.901
planes.

33:00.085 --> 33:01.807
I'm going to have to correct this reading from my 
diary. There were eight of us. The two top cover

33:03.012 --> 33:10.301
guys were back at lower wing, and they were to come 
over and join us, rendezvous with us. Okay. So

33:11.523 --> 33:12.664
there were eight of you. Yeah. Some had never taken 
a plane off at night. Remember, this was before

33:18.551 --> 33:20.474
daylight. Even I had not taken the P-40 off at 
night. Yet these thoughts apparently never

33:24.559 --> 33:27.523
entered the minds of these guys. Checking my diary 
notes, I think back on these moments. It was pitch

33:32.408 --> 33:38.519
dark deep in the jungle of Burma on a desolate RAF 
air strip with no lights whatsoever for

33:32.408 --> 33:38.519
reference. We parked a truck at the far end of the 
grass strip and turned the headlights on. This was

33:43.748 --> 33:47.675
strictly an aiming point for the takeoff. Bob Neal 
earlier took off and I pointed at him. It was 6.10

33:50.019 --> 33:53.505
a.m. when I pushed the throttle full open A blue 
exhaust flame swept around the lower side of my

33:53.992 --> 33:58.858
windshield and trailed along the two slides to the 
rear of my vision. I aimed at the truck lights and

33:59.198 --> 34:03.163
felt my way along the grass strip until the wheels 
felt light. Weaved at a back pressure on a stick and

34:04.464 --> 34:07.167
I was free of the ground. I couldn't see a damn 
thing. I went on instruments. Now this is, you

34:10.992 --> 34:16.178
know, some of these young fellows hadn't even 
flown at night. Flying instruments, too, in a

34:17.179 --> 34:19.342
fighter airplane. It's rough. My basic reference 
was my rate of climb indicator. As long as it showed

34:24.286 --> 34:27.550
up, I felt reasonably assured. A few seconds 
later, I relaxed to look up and see Bob's

34:27.730 --> 34:31.575
navigation lights on his plane. There he was, 
slightly to the left and high. Were you afraid? No.

34:37.182 --> 34:37.662
Taken off? Tense. Oh, no. Just tense. Knew he'd do 
it. I followed and thought to myself, how in the

34:42.468 --> 34:48.496
hell will those other guys make it over? How did 
they? They did. They got over. So all eight of you

34:51.620 --> 34:56.726
were following each other's wing lights. Well, 
after you get in the air, see, it's no flat

34:57.267 --> 35:00.050
airplane. Then as you get further up in the air, you 
know, just as breaking dawn, daylight, you know,

35:00.070 --> 35:05.196
it gets lighter. We were at a rendezvous over the 
field at 10,000 feet. I'm glad I'm reading this out

35:10.522 --> 35:13.105
of the diary because this is correct. A plan called 
for me to fly Bob's right wing in number two

35:14.418 --> 35:22.485
position, for I had flown over the area before and 
recognized Chiang Mai Air Base. To go back here a

35:22.505 --> 35:44.003
minute, on Pearl Harbor Day, we were at Tangu, the 
whole ABG was, and we were shocked that the old man

35:22.505 --> 35:44.003
immediately ordered a flight of two of us to fly 
across to Chiang Mai Air Base, which was where the

35:22.505 --> 35:44.003
Japanese had taken over. that area to see if there 
was any airplanes on it. So I, and of course Bob Neal

35:48.222 --> 35:53.611
and I went, and we checked the base, and I knew the 
area. There's a big mountain right by the air base,

35:53.691 --> 35:56.676
by the way. So I knew exactly where the air base was, 
and that's the reason I was selected to fly next to

35:56.696 --> 36:05.209
Bob Neal's wing. Bob had never seen a plane before. 
Pappy Boyington and Bartling were number three

36:12.130 --> 36:18.179
and four, and then came Eddie Rector and Black Mac 
McGarry as a top cover element of the two ships. So

36:19.561 --> 36:20.583
that gave us six. Jack Newkirk was leading another 
flight with Ed Gesselbrecht on his wing, followed

36:21.103 --> 36:33.882
by a second element of Laura and Buzz Keaton.

36:33.902 --> 36:36.326
Well, we rendezvoused. It'd be too much to read all 
this. We rendezvoused at 10,000 feet, and... By

36:40.480 --> 36:46.987
that time, it was a great enough day where, at that 
altitude, it was light enough to see each other. We

36:47.007 --> 36:48.329
didn't need lights. I turned off the flashlight I 
had between my legs and put it down in the glove

36:48.429 --> 36:56.017
compartment on the side. Then we started off on 
strictly time and distance and compass course for

36:58.560 --> 37:06.629
the air base, Chiang Mai, Thailand. And I think it 
was going to be about a, 30-minute flight,

37:10.687 --> 37:12.289
something like that. It wasn't very far. And Bob 
Neal was leading. Now, Bob and I had agreed the

37:15.672 --> 37:18.656
night before. See, I was flying on his wing. He and I 
agreed that if he overshot or didn't detect this

37:20.217 --> 37:34.553
mountain and wasn't sure of where he was, I would 
fly up, and I did, and I felt he was going off course

37:20.217 --> 37:34.553
and was going to miss it. I would fly up next to him, 
wiggle the wings, and do like this, and I would take

37:34.573 --> 37:38.097
over. No radio transmissions. No, this is total 
radio silence. Oh, yeah. And sure enough, as we got

37:43.760 --> 38:00.481
up towards the mountain, and I knew exactly where 
we were, and we got to the side of the mountain just

37:43.760 --> 38:00.481
off our left wing, when Bob should have started 
turning, he just kept going on. And I knew then that

38:00.621 --> 38:02.563
he wasn't sure. So I moved up, put my wing on my head, 
and he, okay. So then he dropped back and took on my

38:07.550 --> 38:09.432
wings. So you took command then of the attack? I 
took command. The four of us would make the attack

38:13.577 --> 38:20.086
and the other two were to give us high cover in case 
some Japanese airplanes got off. See, then they

38:20.106 --> 38:22.369
would give us cover because we were going to be low. 
We were going to be straking.

38:26.055 --> 38:28.158
I thought you said there was eight of you. Well, 
I'll tell you about the other two. Two to

38:30.461 --> 38:31.162
rendezvous. Yeah. Okay, so you four were ready to 
go down? Newkirk Flight was supposed to

38:35.388 --> 38:38.052
rendezvous with us. He never rendezvoused with 
us. We didn't know what happened until we came

38:40.783 --> 38:42.686
back. I'll tell you that story. So the six of us went 
on down. And to get back, I started down in my turn

38:46.992 --> 38:57.267
from 10,000 feet and drove the jungle to Burma, 
Thailand, Southeast Asia. It's steamy and a lot of

38:57.748 --> 39:04.798
mist and smoke in the morning, just the daylight. 
But I knew that air base had to be right by that

39:05.032 --> 39:09.158
mountain, a big square. Did you see the mountain? 
Yeah, I saw the mountain. You could see the

39:11.822 --> 39:13.624
mountain, but it was all a bunch of haze. Oh, yeah. 
So that's all you could see. Yeah, yeah. But I knew

39:16.048 --> 39:18.952
there, it wasn't fog, but it was haze. Mountains 
stuck up way above me. And I knew where I was. And as I

39:23.538 --> 39:31.950
started down, I began, in a gentle dive, began to 
pick out this square, which was the air base. and

39:32.504 --> 39:46.422
sure enough I knew where it was and so I knew that was 
it and to signal the rest of the flight I turned on my

39:32.504 --> 39:46.422
gun switches and all and gave a burst of my guns to be 
sure and check them out. So of course that alerted

39:47.063 --> 39:50.447
the rest of the other three guys that this was the 
attack. Did that alert the Japanese? Well no, we

39:52.370 --> 39:53.972
were matter of fact in Less than 20 seconds I was 
across the field on the first attack. We were down

39:58.672 --> 40:01.575
about 4,000 or 5,000 feet from the end of the field. 
OK. So you were moving in? Oh, the airplane was, I

40:03.837 --> 40:08.322
mean, the base was completely covered with 
airplanes. One end or the other. They were so close

40:09.643 --> 40:12.826
to one another, the wings were practically 
touching them. Really? What a target. And we came

40:15.609 --> 40:17.010
down. We must have been making about 350 or 400 as we 
came across the base. Miles an hour. You were early

40:20.954 --> 40:22.135
hauling. Oh, yeah. And as I came across the base, I 
came down the line and opened up on a big transport

40:23.332 --> 40:31.622
aircraft, right in line with all the fighters. And 
I was very lucky on that thing. Immediately, it

40:34.425 --> 40:35.747
caught fire. One of the engines burst into the 
plane. Must have been a gas tank. And I went right on

40:38.109 --> 40:40.072
over to the stand. Oh, just barely missed the top of 
the airplane and the buildings and everything

40:40.272 --> 40:47.620
around. Just firing everything out. Yeah. And I 
probably hit the airplane next to it. But there's

40:52.406 --> 40:53.187
so many of them. And of course, the other guys came 
right behind me. And that was the start of the

40:56.631 --> 40:58.053
attack. We caught them completely flat-footed. I 
came around, all of us standing low, not a sign of AA

41:01.699 --> 41:06.446
fire or anything against us. And by the time of that 
low, see, the mist was no problem because we were

41:07.587 --> 41:13.476
right on the field and visibility was good. Even 
2,000 or 3,000 feet, plenty good. So we banked

41:16.440 --> 41:17.822
around sharply. I came back this time to head right 
down the line of these fighter airplanes. And as I

41:23.035 --> 41:28.142
came across a, what's the word we use?

41:31.006 --> 41:31.607
Been so long. But anyway, I climbed just a second to 
get a better view of my target, and then dove down

41:32.368 --> 41:40.018
immediately on this line of fighters. I never got 
over 500, 300 feet above the ground, even on my

41:40.038 --> 41:46.587
climb. So when you were shooting, you were about 
300 feet above the ground? Oh, practically on the

41:50.072 --> 41:51.574
treetops. How high were you when you were 
strafing, when you were shooting? Well, to shoot,

41:56.665 --> 41:59.369
see, you had to point your gun at the airplane. So 
naturally I picked up the first airplane on the end

41:59.590 --> 42:09.105
and started firing at him, his fighters, little 
I-97 fighters, and immediately he caught on fire.

42:09.365 --> 42:11.970
And then until he got lower, you had to pull off of 
him. And then I raked my fire through the rest of

42:12.010 --> 42:15.555
them just to clear him. And as I was I couldn't have 
missed the airplane over 10 or 15 feet. You know,

42:20.387 --> 42:22.310
then it even seemed like five feet. But the pilots 
were getting out of the cockpits. The colors were

42:25.554 --> 42:29.660
turning around, and the pilots were getting out of 
the cockpits to go take cover. They just didn't

42:31.041 --> 42:33.284
have time to get off. They'd come completely 
flat-footed. And they'd given up trying to get

42:35.687 --> 42:38.611
off, see. And now that was second pass. And the 
other three were right behind you. And by the... In

42:46.263 --> 42:56.556
fighter parlance, to make an attack, a strafing 
attack, even come back across your target twice,

42:46.263 --> 42:56.556
even come back across it once, it's almost 
suicide. In Europe, this would have been suicide.

42:59.059 --> 43:00.180
Why? Because of the AAA, and small weapons fire. 
But over there, we would call them some

43:05.046 --> 43:08.530
red-handed, you know, and just flat-footed. Even 
on the second pass, I didn't get any return fire

43:09.631 --> 43:14.177
from the ground. So I came around to make the third 
pass. I almost ran into one of my boys. I don't even

43:18.851 --> 43:20.493
know which one it was. I think it was Barton. He was 
coming across 90 degrees from me, but we missed

43:23.136 --> 43:26.280
each other. Fortunately, it was skipped by luck, 
coordinated, where we were hitting his field in

43:26.921 --> 43:31.787
the wrong direction. And by the third time, I came 
across the third time, down the same line of

43:31.807 --> 43:38.275
fighters, because that's where most of the 
fighters were. And the field began to come up in

43:38.761 --> 43:43.406
smoke and flames all over. And this time, I noticed 
when I went across, I got some tracers firing past

43:43.426 --> 43:48.251
me. So I knew somebody was shooting at me. So I 
pulled off and turned to the right this time. And

43:52.896 --> 43:54.418
what did you aim for that time? Fighters. Still 
fighters. Oh, goodness. There had to be 30

43:56.880 --> 43:59.663
fighters in that one line. What kind were they? The 
line I said. And I don't remember seeing any zeroes

44:02.126 --> 44:05.730
on the field. And then this time it banked to the 
right and came around. And I was going to come down

44:09.160 --> 44:14.730
that line again where the big transport was with 
some of the bigger aircraft. And there had been

44:14.750 --> 44:16.954
some bombers, but I don't remember. And the smoke 
was practically covering the entire field by

44:16.974 --> 44:21.964
then. But I decided to go ahead and make a fourth 
pass. One, two, three, yeah. On the fourth pass.

44:28.727 --> 44:31.230
Now, was everybody still in line behind you? Oh, 
no, they began to go across, you know, flying all

44:31.310 --> 44:34.273
directions. As a matter of fact... Wasn't that 
kind of dangerous? Yeah, you bet it was. Why did

44:38.118 --> 44:40.240
people stay behind each other, basically? Well, 
on the first pass, we did that. But then each person

44:42.983 --> 44:45.767
started picking out his own targets. That's what 
happened. And I agree, it was uncoordinated.

44:50.072 --> 44:55.538
Well, in a lot of ways, it was an advantage because 
we got the entire field covered. But I made four

44:55.878 --> 44:57.520
passes... myself, which was just unheard of. But 
on the fourth pass, by the way, I began to see puffs

45:01.007 --> 45:06.936
of smoke. OK, so tell me about the fourth pass. 
Well, fourth pass, I think I came down the line

45:08.759 --> 45:14.028
where the transport was again. I don't remember 
which one was.

45:23.875 --> 45:27.359
I believe this was my second or third pass. I 
remained low and turned sharply to the left. I got a

45:29.202 --> 45:33.046
glimpse of Bartning's plane zipping past just to 
the rear of me. After some 270 degrees of turning, I

45:33.066 --> 45:40.576
was in a position to strafe another line of parked 
aircraft, practically wing-tripped between

45:33.066 --> 45:40.576
two. Hell, I hadn't seen this many aircraft in 
years. It seemed like the whole Japanese Air Force

45:44.060 --> 45:47.624
had tried to crowd this one little field. I 
couldn't miss. I squeezed the trigger again. Damn

45:50.688 --> 45:52.330
it, my 50s wouldn't go. I charged them quickly. 
They caught. I stayed my aim and straightened the

45:54.324 --> 45:57.627
entire line of ships. It seemed as though my prop 
tip would tip the heads of Jap pilots. That was my

46:00.771 --> 46:01.852
second task. Other men were lying flat on the 
ground nearby, evidently maintenance people.

46:08.399 --> 46:12.103
Props were turning on the fighters, but not a 
single aircraft was taxiing. As I completed my

46:12.123 --> 46:19.110
second run, I got a glimpse of three aircraft, a 
fire and a parked aircraft over which I had made my

46:12.123 --> 46:19.110
first run. flipped sharply to the right to better 
assess the damage I had done, and just at the right

46:19.343 --> 46:23.589
time, too. I saw traceable it's all about me, and it 
was obvious they were meant for me. The AAA defense

46:27.995 --> 46:31.720
had come to life, but they were frantic and 
disorganized. Had we been five minutes earlier,

46:31.740 --> 46:35.845
it would have been too dark. The timing was 
perfect. God and good luck was with us. Puffs of

46:39.851 --> 46:45.098
black smoke appeared about a thousand feet above 
the field, and defense was beginning to get in the

46:39.851 --> 46:45.098
action. I wondered about Ed Rector and Black Mack, 
who were assigned the job as top cover, and craned

46:45.550 --> 46:53.253
my neck searching for enemy aircraft in the area. 
None. I was now lined up for my third pass.
