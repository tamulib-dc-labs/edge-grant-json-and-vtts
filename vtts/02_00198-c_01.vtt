WEBVTT

00:02.326 --> 00:10.876
What advice would you give to the people responsible for that search?

00:10.916 --> 00:12.038
What should they search for?

00:12.098 --> 00:17.204
They need to search for somebody with a high energy level.

00:17.985 --> 00:19.887
This is a hard job.

00:20.508 --> 00:23.712
You see the little pink rabbit on my shelf over there.

00:23.832 --> 00:30.240
My staff members gave me that for my birthday, the first year in here, because

00:30.659 --> 00:31.861
And I appreciated it.

00:32.121 --> 00:34.725
They claimed that they saw me as the pink bunny.

00:35.867 --> 00:36.909
But you need to be.

00:36.949 --> 00:39.553
It's a big workload.

00:39.573 --> 00:44.921
So someone who is energetic and doesn't wear out too easily.

00:45.702 --> 00:50.389
Somebody who's willing to rock a boat now and then.

00:50.369 --> 00:59.860
and somebody who is willing to address the provost and, if necessary, the president forthrightly.

00:59.880 --> 01:11.694
I think it's very important that this job not just be a member of the chain, taking commands and remitting them.

01:12.395 --> 01:16.900
It has never been that, but it's important that it not ever be

01:17.605 --> 01:18.867
allowed to be that.

01:19.087 --> 01:36.392
There have been a couple of occasions when I saw the danger of this or that happening and I made formal appointments with the provost and the president on their schedule and went in and said, I'm here because I need to give you a message.

01:37.514 --> 01:45.385
Should the people they look at most carefully, should they be currently members of the Texas A&M faculty?

01:46.428 --> 01:56.342
I think only current members of Texas A&M faculty should be candidates because you really need the cast of characters and the lay of the land to do this job.

01:59.366 --> 02:01.970
What kind of capability level would you expect?

02:02.591 --> 02:07.778
People need to have an analytical mind.

02:08.247 --> 02:14.997
to read policy statements and translate those into human beings and actual activities.

02:16.980 --> 02:30.641
People need to be not greatly worried about career building and fence mending and making the right friends because you've got to exercise an independent voice here.

02:31.161 --> 02:33.425
Should they have had some administrative experience?

02:33.445 --> 02:35.588
They're going to be eaten alive if they haven't.

02:36.158 --> 02:40.063
What about teaching and or research experience?

02:40.083 --> 02:45.869
I'll tell you, Bill Perry gave me some advice when I was coming in here, which I think is very good advice.

02:45.929 --> 02:58.284
He said it's important for the dean of faculties to be involved in faculty activities, whether teaching or doing scholarship.

02:58.304 --> 03:00.506
But the dean of faculties can't be doing both.

03:01.608 --> 03:03.370
I think that's probably true.

03:03.510 --> 03:05.372
But to have an understanding for it.

03:05.352 --> 03:15.370
Oh, yes, from the past, but I'm sorry, your question was from the past, and I was thinking of more what could be done while holding this role.

03:16.692 --> 03:29.335
Would it be better for them to have been in one of the central academic disciplines of the campus?

03:30.867 --> 03:37.716
The more, shall we say peripheral, that's not good terminology, but I can't think of what to say now.

03:38.477 --> 03:45.227
But the more peripheral the discipline you're in, the harder you're going to have to struggle to understand.

03:45.247 --> 03:46.208
What about the word specialized?

03:46.328 --> 03:46.749
The rest.

03:46.769 --> 03:47.610
That's better.

03:47.910 --> 03:48.451
That's better.

03:49.412 --> 03:53.618
The more specialized the discipline, the harder it's going to be.

03:53.733 --> 03:57.558
One example here, I came from English.

03:57.638 --> 04:00.662
Well, you know, that's about in the center of the campus, isn't it?

04:01.483 --> 04:08.032
And when I was at Rice, I had dealt with all the disciplines we had at Rice because I was director of graduate programs.

04:08.953 --> 04:11.016
I mean, engineering, business, whatever.

04:11.056 --> 04:15.201
And not many people have been lucky enough to have that.

04:15.873 --> 04:30.102
But when I came in, the first hiring papers I saw in veterinary medicine, where they were going to bring people in for non-tenure track things for two or three years, and then turn on the tenure clock, I said, well,

04:30.740 --> 04:31.621
You can't do that.

04:31.762 --> 04:41.457
You don't just... Well, that's standard in veterinary medicine because the nature of the degree and the board certification they have to have.

04:41.497 --> 04:42.759
Well, I had to learn that.

04:43.581 --> 04:48.068
That's a specific example, but it's one of only many.

04:48.308 --> 04:52.094
There's no one that's going to have all the disciplines.

04:52.235 --> 04:56.882
What kind of health, physical health and energy level?

04:57.571 --> 05:03.764
Well, energy level, as you recall, was the first thing I mentioned when you said, what do I need to do?

05:03.944 --> 05:04.826
I did indeed.

05:05.187 --> 05:13.665
And I think I am a person with an unusually high energy level for my advanced age of 62.

05:14.567 --> 05:17.092
But I have to tell you, I'm tired most of the time.

05:17.413 --> 05:18.415
What about sense of humor?

05:19.677 --> 05:21.600
Boy, you're going to need it.

05:21.700 --> 05:27.708
I've already told you that I think there's a lot of opportunity for sadness in this job.

05:27.728 --> 05:30.191
And maybe I let it get me down too much.

05:30.572 --> 05:36.120
Probably somebody that didn't let it get to them as much would be better off.

05:37.602 --> 05:38.883
All right.

05:38.903 --> 05:46.714
When that person walks in, what should be their key priorities when they take over?

05:48.348 --> 05:55.101
They need to learn personally the people they're going to be working with.

05:56.824 --> 06:05.381
They need to study and restudy the policies that affect faculty and learn where to reach for them to get them.

06:06.283 --> 06:11.132
They need to study the AAUP Red Book if they don't already know it.

06:11.652 --> 06:15.937
We produce the Red Book in our policies, but we're pretty darn close.

06:16.979 --> 06:25.929
And they need to be willing to learn from people and be willing to say, gee whiz, I'm sorry I did that.

06:26.310 --> 06:26.971
I'm new.

06:27.051 --> 06:28.332
I'll learn better next time.

06:28.833 --> 06:31.276
And not to let their ego get involved in it.

06:31.777 --> 06:33.559
You can't know it all coming in.

06:33.579 --> 06:36.242
Who should they go talk to for advice?

06:37.133 --> 06:41.818
I would trust Ann Pittman's advice a lot.

06:42.078 --> 06:46.283
She brings a lot of perspective here, and she has a good mind.

06:47.143 --> 06:50.887
She's not just a carrier out of tasks.

06:51.188 --> 06:52.789
She's a person with a good mind.

06:52.809 --> 07:04.862
Identify a couple of deans or associate deans that you can learn from, people who have experience and people who are known for integrity.

07:04.842 --> 07:14.150
For example, are there some people that if you might pick up the phone and say, I've got a situation, I need, I want to get your feedback, what do you think?

07:14.570 --> 07:16.172
Who would those people be for you?

07:17.593 --> 07:18.634
You just want their opinion.

07:18.654 --> 07:22.257
Yeah, well, I've named a few for you already.

07:22.317 --> 07:27.681
Joe Newton is one and Larry Oliver I named, and I named Julia Blackwelder.

07:28.362 --> 07:34.427
If it involves... What about in the senior administration, higher than those?

07:36.500 --> 07:39.945
Hi, I talk with Mark Weichold a lot.

07:44.532 --> 07:49.780
You know, we're already talking pretty darn senior, aren't we, when I mention a dean or two?

07:51.323 --> 07:55.189
All right, let's see.

07:56.411 --> 08:00.557
Proudest moments for you, happiest moments?

08:01.338 --> 08:05.224
When I carry the university mace, that's a proud and happy moment.

08:06.014 --> 08:09.106
I can really get myself up for ceremonies.

08:09.407 --> 08:16.716
I think rituals are important in the life of any group or institution.

08:17.995 --> 08:21.780
I can really put myself in a frame of mind and really feel it.

08:21.860 --> 08:26.687
I'm not faking it to think, isn't this wonderful?

08:26.927 --> 08:28.069
Isn't this splendid?

08:28.129 --> 08:37.321
To have my hands on the visible manifestation of so much tradition and pride and endeavor.

08:38.363 --> 08:42.769
And aren't I lucky to be the first woman to get to do this?

08:43.350 --> 08:47.395
I think that's a very high moment.

08:49.248 --> 08:59.241
When I met with our minority faculty last summer in those two focus group meetings, and they did me the honor of their candor,

08:59.862 --> 09:03.166
I'm not imagining they told me everything they possibly could have.

09:03.226 --> 09:03.907
Of course not.

09:04.628 --> 09:09.314
Here I sit, a white female, and they shared so much with me.

09:09.334 --> 09:12.598
I felt very moved and honored by that.

09:14.080 --> 09:16.703
And that was a moment of great pride.

09:16.723 --> 09:22.731
A couple of the promotion and tenure cases where it was touch and go.

09:22.711 --> 09:27.318
And I've been able to say, but think about this.

09:27.498 --> 09:28.399
Think about this.

09:28.580 --> 09:31.223
And people have gone back and thought about it.

09:31.344 --> 09:37.112
And faculty members have been promoted or have been kept who might not have been.

09:37.793 --> 09:39.195
Boy, do I like that.

09:39.456 --> 09:42.480
Now, I really feed on that one.

09:43.942 --> 09:46.626
Any truly sad moments?

09:47.264 --> 10:08.817
I was telling you a moment ago about this faculty member and sad moments of people who I've seen mess up their careers in certain ways and powerless to stop it.

10:09.944 --> 10:24.392
Some of the exit interviews I've had when people have laid forth their complaints and I've seen ways in which maybe as an institution we failed them, we didn't.

10:26.060 --> 10:30.585
we didn't nurture their careers as well as we should have.

10:30.625 --> 10:48.726
That has bothered me a whole lot because this is such a wonderful place and nobody's going to hit on all the cylinders all the time but when I see those moments when we're not hitting on them very well that that bothers me a lot.

10:49.128 --> 10:50.070
All right.

10:51.714 --> 10:59.490
I've asked this a little bit already, but what does A&M do best as an institution, and what does it do least well?

11:02.456 --> 11:09.752
I think what we do best is attract really good people here.

11:10.930 --> 11:18.441
Maybe what we do least well is to pay attention to the things that will keep those good people here.

11:19.022 --> 11:32.021
We do real well at attracting early career people who are just stellar in their qualifications and bringing their careers up to the mid-level and they get ripe for the picking and they get picked away.

11:32.082 --> 11:34.345
They need to do better.

11:34.565 --> 11:37.670
Should we do some picking more than we do?

11:37.710 --> 11:39.773
We tend to hire in almost every case,

11:40.394 --> 11:42.136
at junior level.

11:43.678 --> 11:45.239
Most of our hiring is, yeah.

11:45.339 --> 11:52.928
Whereas Ivy League schools and some of the old established great public universities, they hire stars.

11:53.168 --> 11:53.509
Should we?

11:53.529 --> 11:55.110
Yeah, but I don't want to go there.

11:56.192 --> 12:02.959
The reason that they do that is because they wash out their assistant professors over and over, and that's not fair.

12:03.749 --> 12:09.616
Oh, no, but on occasion when we have, let's make believe we have an outstanding faculty member to retire.

12:10.878 --> 12:15.744
Should we sometimes fill some of those with proven scholars?

12:15.904 --> 12:17.806
And we have sometimes, yes.

12:18.106 --> 12:19.588
We do sometimes, and you're right.

12:20.509 --> 12:26.296
There you have to look at the department in question and ask, does it still have senior leadership?

12:26.477 --> 12:31.022
And if the answer is no, it needs senior leadership, and you need to go out for it, yeah.

12:31.576 --> 12:37.627
In terms of our facilities, I'm including library now as facilities, are we making progress?

12:37.928 --> 12:39.170
Library's wonderful.

12:39.270 --> 12:43.799
Library is getting better, much stronger than when I came here.

12:43.839 --> 12:48.107
And its physical facilities are much better.

12:48.127 --> 12:49.990
Fred Heath has done a wonderful job.

12:50.476 --> 12:55.506
Academic buildings in general, we are desperate for space.

12:58.251 --> 13:07.489
We have some places where we have opportunities to make senior hires, and I don't know where we'd put them.

13:07.469 --> 13:12.295
Space is like the last frontier for a university.

13:12.395 --> 13:19.964
I mean, it's the thing that can never be entirely conquered and it's the most difficult of all problems.

13:20.064 --> 13:23.308
My own office space has been a terrible problem.

13:23.889 --> 13:31.418
We struggled and struggled and struggled and finally got a teeny bit of extra space on the third floor behind the elevator.

13:31.398 --> 13:36.384
And if you don't think that's inconvenient, but we were delighted to get it.

13:37.145 --> 13:42.372
The Center for Teaching Excellence desperately needs appropriate space.

13:42.592 --> 13:55.909
And I send Bill Perry, who's now, you know, academic space czar, I send him emails about every two months reminding him about Center for Teaching Excellence.

13:55.969 --> 13:59.734
And we haven't cracked that nut yet, because we don't know where to go.

14:00.794 --> 14:01.736
We're turned.

14:01.796 --> 14:02.958
That's a real problem.

14:04.080 --> 14:15.141
See, one of the blessings when all of us were in the Koch building is that every afternoon at about 530,

14:16.370 --> 14:20.776
Those of us that were the key people in that building, we'd get together and say, what happened today?

14:20.856 --> 14:21.657
What have you heard about?

14:21.697 --> 14:22.718
Here's the problem.

14:22.738 --> 14:23.899
No, we don't have that.

14:23.980 --> 14:25.101
And that doesn't happen anymore.

14:25.121 --> 14:26.343
It does not happen.

14:26.523 --> 14:37.356
We're scattered, and the place is so big, and we are so eaten up with busyness that we don't often do the unstructured sharing.

14:37.456 --> 14:38.498
I wish that were true.

14:38.778 --> 14:39.479
I think we need it.

14:40.600 --> 14:45.887
All right, now, I've only got a little bit more, and what topics have we not touched on that we should have?

14:47.926 --> 14:48.867
Oh, goodness.

14:49.709 --> 14:53.274
You ask such hard questions.

14:54.016 --> 14:56.720
We've talked a little bit about the faculty senate.

14:58.362 --> 15:06.836
What is the senate and faculty governance, is it doing, is it appropriate at its level here?

15:09.360 --> 15:11.904
Well, certainly the structures are appropriate.

15:12.064 --> 15:14.608
I'm sorry to say that I think

15:16.006 --> 15:24.739
There are parts of the university where people are not interested in the faculty senate, don't think it does anything, and don't care to participate.

15:25.661 --> 15:27.904
And that's unfortunate.

15:28.725 --> 15:35.515
The senate would be stronger if people let it be stronger by being part of it.

15:35.716 --> 15:37.799
I guess these things wax and wane.

15:37.859 --> 15:40.743
That's one way.

15:40.783 --> 15:45.270
Should the faculty senate take more responsibility

15:45.858 --> 15:55.870
for dealing with faculty colleagues who are not meeting their classes regularly and who are not living up to their responsibilities?

15:55.950 --> 15:56.150
No.

15:56.771 --> 15:57.211
They shouldn't?

15:57.231 --> 15:58.593
I just don't think that's their role.

15:58.733 --> 15:59.234
Okay.

15:59.254 --> 16:05.040
They're not there to be the disciplinarians or the administrators.

16:05.140 --> 16:08.264
They're there to raise issues.

16:08.284 --> 16:08.664
Okay.

16:09.125 --> 16:10.887
Yeah.

16:12.149 --> 16:23.509
Faculty governance in the sense of the decision making process within departments varies from department to department.

16:23.530 --> 16:28.639
My own predilection is for maximum participation.

16:29.540 --> 16:30.462
Example.

16:31.437 --> 16:45.997
Every professor who has tenure and is an associate professor, say, is theoretically entitled to vote on the assistant professor coming up for tenure in her or his department.

16:46.498 --> 16:53.027
But in some departments, only a small subset vote, a three-person committee or something.

16:53.468 --> 16:56.652
I think everybody who

16:56.632 --> 17:00.937
is of appropriate rank, ought to be enfranchised in all these decisions.

17:02.198 --> 17:04.200
Annual review processes.

17:05.181 --> 17:19.296
In my view, there ought to be a faculty committee, at least partially elected, in every department looking at people's annual reports and making recommendations about the salary decisions.

17:19.736 --> 17:21.238
There are, in some departments,

17:21.674 --> 17:24.037
but not in all, and we don't mandate.

17:24.217 --> 17:25.839
We leave it to local culture.

17:26.499 --> 17:29.242
I would like to see more democratic participation.

17:30.003 --> 17:44.779
In serious personnel decisions within a department, tenure, termination, promotion, should the department administrator, rather called department chairman or department head,

17:45.147 --> 17:51.753
Should they automatically be bound in their recommendation by the majority of the vote of the department?

17:52.774 --> 17:55.417
I think it's working well without that system.

17:55.957 --> 17:57.899
I don't think that's true.

17:59.320 --> 18:06.567
Because we do require pretty elaborate documentation of what the faculty sentiment was.

18:06.607 --> 18:13.213
And if the head goes against that, it's transparently evident.

18:14.206 --> 18:15.630
so we can look at both.

18:16.231 --> 18:17.554
And I think it's okay.

18:18.096 --> 18:19.961
Is that general what she's done all across campus?

18:20.061 --> 18:20.963
Yes, yes.

18:22.647 --> 18:26.477
Okay, you're now, let's see, did we think of any other things that we need

18:27.385 --> 18:29.589
No, I'll think of them after you've gone.

18:29.609 --> 18:35.619
I will say that I'm very happy to have been able to maintain my scholarship while I've been here.

18:35.820 --> 18:39.907
That's been very important to me, and it gives me a sense of identity.

18:40.548 --> 18:51.908
If I'm swallowed up with problems and I'm sitting here thinking, I didn't go to graduate school to do that, if I can look across the room and see my book that was published,

18:51.888 --> 18:54.992
It's also relaxation in a way, isn't it?

18:55.012 --> 18:55.753
Yes, it is.

18:56.233 --> 18:57.775
It's work, but it's a different work.

18:57.915 --> 18:59.077
What are you working on now?

18:59.097 --> 19:14.335
I'm reading proofs on a book that'll come out from University of Nebraska Press at the end of this year, which is a calendar of the letters of Willa Cather, and it's a very detailed, different kind of scholarly thing than I've done before.

19:14.315 --> 19:19.181
I was about to ask why Nebraska Press until you said the subject matter.

19:19.361 --> 19:20.642
That's right.

19:20.662 --> 19:22.204
Do you have a plan for what's next?

19:22.985 --> 19:26.109
I have not only a plan, I have a manuscript partly done.

19:26.189 --> 19:37.141
I'm co-authoring, working on with Alan Houchins in Music, a book on poetry and music of the two world wars, World War I and World War II.

19:37.602 --> 19:40.305
We're especially interested in poems

19:40.606 --> 19:48.490
that were then set to music, poetry that established itself as poetry and was then set to music when the two art forms come together.

19:48.510 --> 19:50.717
I hope you're going to send it to a local press.

19:51.558 --> 20:04.480
I inquired of our press about this project before our present director came and did not receive any expression of interest, whatever.

20:04.500 --> 20:13.135
And I slightly knew an acquisitions editor at TCU and mentioned it to him and were under contract with TCU Press.

20:13.155 --> 20:17.262
I was going to say, if you'd send me a note, I would be delighted to hand it to the...

20:17.242 --> 20:21.848
to the director over there.

20:22.068 --> 20:25.452
I think Mr. Backus would have given me a different reaction.

20:25.472 --> 20:26.213
I believe you're right.

20:27.034 --> 20:29.878
Okay, you've now been hired as a consultant.

20:31.801 --> 20:39.250
What advice would you give to the, as the consultant, to the search committee as they look for the new dean of faculties?

20:41.997 --> 20:46.004
They want a high-energy person.

20:46.064 --> 20:57.465
They want to hear expressions of commitment to diversity that they can believe are not just formulaic but are genuine.

20:57.505 --> 21:04.478
They want a person who is experienced in academia,

21:05.386 --> 21:14.155
and seems secure enough to be able to stand up against carping and criticism and not be just devastated by it.

21:15.116 --> 21:17.438
And a sense of humor helps.

21:18.138 --> 21:33.013
And you know, I guess I must have been solemn today, because in staff meeting and all, I sometimes serve the role of the kind of the group clown or shaker-upper, or I propose that we need more fun around here.

21:32.993 --> 21:37.662
But today, I haven't been able to think of much fun as you and I have talked.

21:38.263 --> 21:41.028
Yeah, people need that.

21:41.870 --> 21:53.972
What advice would you give the provost, whomever it may be, whether it's a current provost or a future provost, about the role of the dean of faculties and about the academic programs in general?

21:54.323 --> 21:57.890
The dean of faculties needs an associate dean of faculties.

21:59.032 --> 22:00.455
The workload is too much.

22:02.098 --> 22:10.273
And I'm not sure exactly how that job should be configured, but I think we need it both to handle

22:10.253 --> 22:30.540
what we need to do and to serve as a developmental opportunity for more people because they're people with the capabilities who think they would like to try out administration but they need entrees into it and a half-time one would be a good way to do it.

22:31.861 --> 22:33.223
So I am going to be

22:33.203 --> 22:51.432
urging that I think that our relations with Galveston can stand clarification and improvement because it is part of us and yet it isn't it's separately budgeted and you know why I'm chuckling don't you

22:51.412 --> 22:54.557
that it has ever been thus.

22:57.822 --> 23:18.735
Chuck McCandless, when he was my right-hand man, he came up with the idea and he said, let us clearly identify it as a college of Texas A&M that its courses interact with ours, but there is one admissions office

23:20.605 --> 23:27.934
You graduate from Texas A&M, and so forth and so on, but that never came down.

23:28.335 --> 23:30.257
No, that's one of those perennial problems.

23:30.277 --> 23:35.323
All right, you're still the consultant now advising the provost about A&M academics in general.

23:35.964 --> 23:41.331
Any advice about academics in general?

23:42.087 --> 23:43.910
No, I don't think so.

23:43.950 --> 23:53.664
The development of the arts is extremely important, but I would advise that it's not something you go into until you've counted the cost.

23:54.425 --> 23:59.773
Because if you go into it without adequate resources, you're not going to be happy with the results.

23:59.793 --> 24:04.480
You're going to divert resources from others who could do well with it, and it will be a botch.

24:04.560 --> 24:06.863
So either have what we need,

24:06.843 --> 24:12.431
and do it well or keep putting off until we can do it well.

24:13.853 --> 24:25.290
All right, now you're, as a consultant, you're advising the president of Texas A&M about the future of this institution.

24:25.523 --> 24:28.466
I know some things I'd say, but I'm not going to tell you what they'd be.

24:28.606 --> 24:29.347
Oh, really?

24:29.367 --> 24:29.467
Okay.

24:29.487 --> 24:29.627
Yeah.

24:30.068 --> 24:30.748
I'm sorry.

24:30.768 --> 24:31.189
Okay.

24:32.270 --> 24:33.331
All right.

24:33.631 --> 24:35.633
What about the chancellor and the regents?

24:35.653 --> 24:41.579
Any advice you'd give them about Texas A&M?

24:41.599 --> 24:53.151
The system is not the university, and we need to keep a clear distinction between them, and I really do believe that.

24:54.312 --> 24:56.417
Usually we do, but sometimes we don't.

24:59.846 --> 25:05.200
Do the regents seem to be well informed about this institution?

25:05.230 --> 25:24.793
We have had wonderful boards of regents the last few years, the best that we've ever had that I know of, and that doesn't mean that I always have known either, but to my limited acquaintance, I think we've had wonderful boards and wonderful chairs for our board the last couple of years.

25:26.094 --> 25:28.557
I've got two or three items to share with you after the term.

25:28.577 --> 25:28.717
Okay.

25:29.679 --> 25:30.900
All right, last question then.

25:31.032 --> 25:36.700
As you drive away headed west, what thoughts about Texas A&M will you carry in your heart?

25:39.524 --> 25:47.376
I am going to be grateful that I was able to come here and do what I think was some good work.

25:48.077 --> 25:54.947
And very few people in this life have the chance to go and exercise

25:56.159 --> 26:02.171
their own initiative, even a little bit, and accomplish something that they think was worth doing.

26:02.331 --> 26:04.275
And there have been times I've been able to do that.

26:04.716 --> 26:09.004
You can't ask for more than that.
