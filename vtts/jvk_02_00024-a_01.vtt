WEBVTT

00:00:03.187 --> 00:00:12.203
I believe it is, and getting ready to chat with Jimmy Bond as we look out on a very unusually warm December day.

00:00:12.263 --> 00:00:16.371
We're sitting in his office at 4444 Carter Creek Parkway.

00:00:17.052 --> 00:00:18.715
Jimmy, now test your machine.

00:00:18.965 --> 00:00:19.566
Hi, Haskell.

00:00:19.586 --> 00:00:20.527
It's good to have you here.

00:00:20.567 --> 00:00:23.672
Good to see you again and look forward to our visit.

00:00:25.435 --> 00:00:33.847
Jimmy, as we begin, let's make believe that a person looking at this material or listening to it is not acquainted with you and your background.

00:00:34.748 --> 00:00:44.162
Begin, if you would, with a brief biographical summary of your growing up and experience until you become an employee of A&M.

00:00:44.142 --> 00:00:51.655
It turns out that I was born and had my upbringing in College Station.

00:00:52.597 --> 00:01:05.660
Born in 1936, College Station was incorporated in 1938 so I grew up in the village of College Station with A&M as my playground along with my friends.

00:01:06.882 --> 00:01:07.804
Lived out

00:01:07.784 --> 00:01:11.994
south of College Station at what was then a community known as Rock Prairie.

00:01:12.435 --> 00:01:19.271
Now a very strategic crossing of the county is Rock Prairie Road and that intersects where I grew up.

00:01:20.013 --> 00:01:25.185
Went to public school as a third generation Brazos Countyite.

00:01:25.739 --> 00:01:45.064
through public school at A&M Consolidated School System and stayed to attend A&M as did almost all of my classmates, at which time A&M was an all-male, all military

00:01:45.044 --> 00:01:52.577
institution and we in those days wore a uniform 24 hours a day in church, dates, whatever.

00:01:53.038 --> 00:01:59.589
Even as a local there was no such thing as being non-reg and being legal.

00:02:00.190 --> 00:02:03.976
So that was my upbringing.

00:02:04.117 --> 00:02:06.681
I took a commission and served

00:02:06.661 --> 00:02:22.290
in the Army, Quartermaster Corps at Fort Lee, Virginia for a brief period then completed my reserve commitment in business in Navasota for 18 years.

00:02:22.270 --> 00:02:44.802
with family owned business there until 1976 when I was summoned and given the opportunity to replace the then one and first system attorney that A&M had had as its in-house lawyer.

00:02:44.782 --> 00:02:55.680
and did that in March of 1976 bringing with me my wife who was also a native of College Station and my family of four children.

00:02:56.321 --> 00:02:57.342
Now you went to law school where?

00:02:57.843 --> 00:03:09.642
I went to law school during my period of employment at Navasota which was insurance and real estate and in the evenings I commuted to the University of Houston

00:03:10.010 --> 00:03:14.114
by leaving at four o'clock, three days a week, getting back home.

00:03:15.515 --> 00:03:19.699
I'd attend class from six to nine, and we'd get home about 10.30 or quarter to 11.

00:03:21.261 --> 00:03:29.388
And did that four and a half years, and did that in the first 10 years out of A&M.

00:03:29.769 --> 00:03:38.397
Took that long, but obtained my law degree and practiced law the last eight years before leaving Navasota.

00:03:38.849 --> 00:03:41.553
and before assuming the position at A&M.

00:03:41.573 --> 00:03:53.391
All right, before we go on with your career, summarize as best you can your predecessor, whom most of us referred to as Judge Amos.

00:03:53.952 --> 00:04:06.590
Describe him and his manner and style, and as far as you know, the general nature of his task as the chief counsel for A&M.

00:04:06.610 --> 00:04:08.333
First of all, he was universally loved.

00:04:08.752 --> 00:04:11.435
as far as I could tell by everybody, and rightfully so.

00:04:12.215 --> 00:04:37.459
Secondly, he came to A&M out of the Attorney General's office as sort of a program of loaning him to A&M, and I don't know whether General Rutter or who had managed to pull that off, but he then became a fully vested employee of the system, which was then administered, as you know, by basically one person throughout most of that time.

00:04:38.873 --> 00:04:39.914
But J.A.

00:04:39.974 --> 00:05:08.728
Jake Amos, lovingly called Judge Amos, was the single lawyer, and I guess out of necessity operated in a manner that all of us wish we could have continued, and that would be that he would frequently answer a question by asking you one, and if he did not get the matter solved by just dealing that way with his clients,

00:05:09.400 --> 00:05:16.287
almost without exception, his opinions would be found in the margin of the letter that came over.

00:05:16.807 --> 00:05:32.242
And so what I had to look at was basically an exchange of some level of correspondence, but there was not any body of opinions very much to go by.

00:05:32.262 --> 00:05:38.648
He did so and in those days was able to manage the job that way.

00:05:39.337 --> 00:05:43.541
about whether or not I would be sufficiently challenged.

00:05:43.561 --> 00:05:51.650
And I came to the position, wanting to focus and be very much focused on a particular area of law.

00:05:52.350 --> 00:05:54.513
And that was emerging and that was education law.

00:05:56.214 --> 00:06:05.083
Worrying as I did, though, that the thing looked pretty sleepy when I interviewed and well, was that going to keep me challenged?

00:06:06.985 --> 00:06:08.567
So that was kind of the nature of

00:06:08.868 --> 00:06:11.230
the program when I arrived.

00:06:11.290 --> 00:06:20.139
When you moved in, describe the location of the legal office and the staffing and so forth.

00:06:20.159 --> 00:06:37.795
Judge Amos and then me were placed within the office of the Vice Chancellor and Comptroller, Clyde Freeman, who we all loved and

00:06:39.192 --> 00:07:04.204
learn to revere based on his wonderful achievements, but we were all within his his administration which was located on the north end of the second floor across the rotunda, the open rotunda from the Chancellor's lodging on the south end of the second floor.

00:07:05.011 --> 00:07:08.055
And you said 1976 is when you began?

00:07:08.135 --> 00:07:10.238
That's correct, March of 76.

00:07:10.258 --> 00:07:14.744
And so you got there just about the same time Dr. Williams became ill.

00:07:15.906 --> 00:07:19.731
I was there just before his terrible heart attack.

00:07:21.053 --> 00:07:22.675
Back to the selection process.

00:07:22.936 --> 00:07:24.017
Matter of months.

00:07:24.678 --> 00:07:27.542
The selection process in which you were selected.

00:07:28.687 --> 00:07:30.469
Did somebody contact you?

00:07:31.230 --> 00:07:32.712
There wasn't a search committee?

00:07:32.752 --> 00:07:33.773
There wasn't that?

00:07:33.793 --> 00:07:37.117
I had a father-in-law who was on the first floor who reported to Clyde.

00:07:37.497 --> 00:07:37.918
Okay.

00:07:37.938 --> 00:07:39.219
And he was a fiscal officer.

00:07:40.241 --> 00:07:44.285
And he became aware that Judge Amos was going to retire.

00:07:44.806 --> 00:07:49.451
He casually asked me if I would possibly have any interest in that kind of job.

00:07:50.673 --> 00:07:54.838
I expressed, you know, more than a casual interest.

00:07:54.958 --> 00:07:57.681
And I had been in a

00:07:58.589 --> 00:08:04.256
I had been in a meeting down at Cat Arena that's owned by Dolph Briscoe.

00:08:05.758 --> 00:08:12.127
And I had been president of the Chamber of Commerce and we had had Dolph as our speaker and in my home.

00:08:13.148 --> 00:08:19.116
And when I attended that meeting down there as he prepared to run for governor, Mr. Freeman was there.

00:08:19.657 --> 00:08:24.122
And it just happened that he and I had spent a lot of time chatting.

00:08:24.143 --> 00:08:26.065
Neither one of us were big bird hunters.

00:08:26.669 --> 00:08:28.633
And we had some enjoyable visits.

00:08:28.733 --> 00:08:34.444
And so I was a known quantity to Clyde by reason of that visit.

00:08:34.464 --> 00:08:37.751
And so it's just how the stars sort of came together.

00:08:37.831 --> 00:08:43.682
It would be, I would say, fortuitous and little else.

00:08:44.590 --> 00:09:13.011
as far as you understood at the time you were selected what were was the major area of responsibility and duty of the office what did you think the job was going to be i thought it would be in the nature of the corporate council that is there to to advise and help administrative decisions that you would typically

00:09:13.430 --> 00:09:15.052
see as an in-house counsel.

00:09:15.472 --> 00:09:38.939
I was told that their level of interest was in the emerging area of employment law and that they would give me the authority to engage a second lawyer very soon after Judge Amos retired and that they wanted that person to have some expertise in employment law.

00:09:40.281 --> 00:09:41.142
As you recall,

00:09:42.218 --> 00:09:52.658
was so lucky to hire Ed Koska as my second in command and he had a master's degree in employment law at Michigan State from that law school.

00:09:52.678 --> 00:09:58.851
Alright, you came in, what were your impressions of Jack Williams?

00:09:59.211 --> 00:10:03.720
Gosh, I loved the man then and now and I guess that's a thing that grows.

00:10:04.274 --> 00:10:16.205
I'm certain that he was not everything that my fond recollections dictate now, but I adored him.

00:10:16.365 --> 00:10:21.130
He was a man of very few but convincing words.

00:10:22.011 --> 00:10:33.201
And when he completed whatever he had to say and coupled it with the smile and style that you got out of it,

00:10:33.670 --> 00:10:34.431
Dr. Williams.

00:10:35.893 --> 00:10:44.103
You just knew you were in tall company and I had that enormous amount of respect for him.

00:10:44.123 --> 00:10:51.052
And then he had the terrible year-long outage that almost took his life.

00:10:51.132 --> 00:10:58.902
And Mr. Freeman, as you know, was the person then to step in and run the system.

00:10:59.236 --> 00:11:01.538
and in that time, president of the university.

00:11:01.558 --> 00:11:02.879
I mean, that was a single job.

00:11:03.900 --> 00:11:12.308
So that was just one man short, and the number of people running that total organization were pretty small then.

00:11:15.130 --> 00:11:26.681
I was still new and looking for validation, and I can so well remember not knowing for sure what Dr. Williams' condition was.

00:11:26.741 --> 00:11:29.243
He had gotten back to the president's home

00:11:31.045 --> 00:11:34.909
And I came to learn that he was reading most of the material.

00:11:34.949 --> 00:11:39.114
They would take him a reading file and he was sitting in his chair and read.

00:11:39.695 --> 00:11:41.277
And he was a wonderful dictator.

00:11:41.958 --> 00:11:53.331
And I would get these little one sentence centered in the middle of a small monarch-sized piece of paper that would make you feel like a million dollars.

00:11:53.351 --> 00:11:58.977
It's almost a thing that would make you weep now when you think back of how

00:11:59.682 --> 00:12:09.179
a man could use so few words and have such a validating effect on people and get the very best out of them.

00:12:09.680 --> 00:12:11.564
That's what I would describe him as being.

00:12:12.545 --> 00:12:23.445
As one who was working across the street then for Dr. Calhoun, I remember also that Williams, before being ill but even after he recovered,

00:12:24.337 --> 00:12:28.163
that there was a quick turnaround on almost every piece of mail.

00:12:28.183 --> 00:12:30.027
It didn't lie on the table very long.

00:12:30.287 --> 00:12:31.229
It certainly did not.

00:12:32.190 --> 00:12:37.639
He was decisive, if not always right, but he was certainly decisive.

00:12:38.220 --> 00:12:39.442
All right, back to the beginning.

00:12:40.284 --> 00:12:42.227
As you began your task,

00:12:42.528 --> 00:12:46.111
Did you find any landmines or any leftovers?

00:12:46.391 --> 00:12:51.196
Were there any critical cases that you had to join in and work on immediately?

00:12:51.316 --> 00:12:56.420
There were two or three, and I had the good fortune of having spent the time to go through the files.

00:12:57.481 --> 00:13:04.468
And just my curiosity drove me to want to know what they all amounted to.

00:13:04.488 --> 00:13:10.493
I was a little surprised that there were as few as there were, but some were...

00:13:10.979 --> 00:13:12.121
you know, substantial.

00:13:12.241 --> 00:13:20.174
And I can remember the Preston pool case was in a stage of a consent decree with the Justice Department.

00:13:20.194 --> 00:13:23.740
And that had been a black extension agent out of Galveston.

00:13:24.682 --> 00:13:36.582
And as I understand it, as we sit here today, and this is January of 2000, I think there is still the vestiges are, I think the Preston pool case is still

00:13:37.540 --> 00:13:46.313
in the stratosphere, never having been completely dismissed by the Justice Department learned that not so long ago.

00:13:46.333 --> 00:13:47.495
That was one case.

00:13:47.715 --> 00:14:04.020
And, you know, I learned for the first time, some of the some of the words and uses of terms that is used in statistical sampling of numbers and

00:14:04.540 --> 00:14:27.330
And I remember how really I felt like I was going to school, almost a seminar on how the Justice Department and people dealing with numbers and statistics make those things say what they want to say.

00:14:27.830 --> 00:14:31.375
The other thing was that there was a longstanding lawsuit

00:14:33.785 --> 00:14:49.701
at Prairie View involving 100 plus acres of land next to the Prairie View campus that had been occupied for over 100 years by a family named Sorsby.

00:14:51.763 --> 00:15:02.914
And the Sorsby family had been using that property

00:15:03.637 --> 00:15:12.309
a lawsuit had been filed like you would to, to oust a trespasser.

00:15:12.329 --> 00:15:24.405
And that suit had been laying around a long time and that legislation had been passed and, and I went to the first board meeting that was introduced to the board for the first time.

00:15:24.425 --> 00:15:29.712
And I so well remember Dooley Bells in his

00:15:31.835 --> 00:15:37.801
kind of hard-hitting style, wouldn't know what I knew about that Sarsby lawsuit.

00:15:37.821 --> 00:15:45.908
Well, again, good fortune served me, and I had read it enough to be able to speak to it.

00:15:46.028 --> 00:15:50.873
And I probably knew more about it than my predecessor because it was old and stale.

00:15:51.974 --> 00:16:01.723
But those things serve you pretty well over the long haul when you're working in a fora board or a bureaucracy.

00:16:01.889 --> 00:16:03.831
Those are two things I remember very well.

00:16:03.851 --> 00:16:16.806
I also remember going through those files that I noticed a file for Cullen Davis at Fort Worth who had been a former student.

00:16:16.866 --> 00:16:29.500
I'm not sure if Cullen was a graduate but he clearly was an Aggie and Cullen had made substantial gifts of shares of stock to the university and

00:16:34.475 --> 00:16:39.861
And so that's just another one of the files that I remember seeing when I first arrived.

00:16:41.223 --> 00:16:52.036
Describe how you became acquainted with the way boards of regents really operate.

00:16:52.697 --> 00:16:57.543
There must have been some interesting learning experiences in those first months.

00:16:58.764 --> 00:17:03.790
There were, and it was a little bit difficult for me at this stage to go back and

00:17:04.225 --> 00:17:07.709
and put things exactly where they belong.

00:17:07.729 --> 00:17:27.550
But what happened soon after that event that I just told you about, and I later learned how important that was, because today, Mr. Bell is on a board that I serve, which is the Heat Foundation Board.

00:17:28.036 --> 00:17:35.042
And I don't have a better friend or a more trusted confidant anywhere than Dooley Bell.

00:17:35.062 --> 00:17:38.525
And it all kind of comes out of first impressions.

00:17:39.486 --> 00:17:43.249
Well, another was when Royce Wisemaker was appointed to the board.

00:17:46.352 --> 00:17:52.057
I may use a word here that is characteristic of Royce, and I love him very much.

00:17:52.737 --> 00:17:57.942
But the meeting went along throughout his being sworn in

00:17:58.343 --> 00:18:06.936
that day by Peyton McKnight or Bill Moore or whoever came to make it a pretty pompous ceremony.

00:18:07.457 --> 00:18:21.078
And I acted as counsel throughout the course of the meeting and responded in an appropriate way and kept my place and did what I thought was right.

00:18:21.118 --> 00:18:27.287
When the meeting was over, I made it my way over to his side of the room

00:18:27.824 --> 00:18:36.197
to simply, before leaving, make sure that I had greeted him and introduced myself to him.

00:18:38.240 --> 00:18:55.367
And happily did not say the wrong words, just introduced myself by name, and he called me lawyer, and forever did, and said he had been watching me.

00:18:55.955 --> 00:19:05.044
that he knew a lot about lawyers and how they operated, and so far he had been favorably impressed.

00:19:06.485 --> 00:19:17.556
And then he wheeled around in his chair and looked up over his glasses and told me that he was damn glad that I didn't come over there and say, welcome aboard.

00:19:17.676 --> 00:19:20.018
He said, every other son of a bitch in the room.

00:19:20.538 --> 00:19:25.303
And he said, I want you to know I've been aboard for a very long time.

00:19:25.840 --> 00:19:29.946
He was the first donor to the President's Endowed Scholarship.

00:19:29.966 --> 00:19:32.489
And he was the first of a lot of things, as you know.

00:19:33.090 --> 00:19:43.965
And Royce had been a player, quote unquote, at our great university for a very long time and considered himself to have paid his dues.

00:19:44.065 --> 00:19:46.589
And he'd been on the first Aggie club.

00:19:47.070 --> 00:19:51.696
So Royce had been offended, frankly, by those who

00:19:51.895 --> 00:19:57.662
had just casually used an expression that we all use, welcome aboard.

00:19:57.682 --> 00:20:03.990
Well, he took that from me, hey buddy, I've been aboard a long time before you've ever even thought of.

00:20:04.010 --> 00:20:06.393
And so it's those kinds of experiences.

00:20:07.113 --> 00:20:16.705
John Blocker came on the board at some later date, and it was not long after I got there, because Joe Reynolds was on the board,

00:20:17.191 --> 00:20:43.232
And before leaving Navasota, I had done a very complex real estate deal for my bank president that had sold land in Robinson County to Joe Reynolds and Calvin Guest, who bought things together and were marine solid friends and still are to this day and well should be.

00:20:43.516 --> 00:21:12.898
but they had been part of a takeout group of some land that my bank president and some others had bought and in those days there were wraparound mortgages there were second liens and all the profits were represented in second mortgages and these wraparound notes and lord have mercy i had i had developed a whole schedule so anybody could understand i remember had shared that with calvin

00:21:13.503 --> 00:21:15.445
who had given it to Joe.

00:21:15.945 --> 00:21:18.407
And so I was a known quantity to Joe.

00:21:19.569 --> 00:21:29.017
And Joe and Blocker met me over in the MSC one day just by chance.

00:21:29.037 --> 00:21:37.545
And they made it very clear to me that I had a great future at A&M and that I was their kind of person.

00:21:37.565 --> 00:21:40.908
Now, Joe was pretty good about blowing that smoke.

00:21:41.088 --> 00:21:42.970
You know, Joe has...

00:21:43.507 --> 00:21:45.930
a jillion and one best friends.

00:21:45.950 --> 00:21:48.553
I was one of them and I honored that.

00:21:49.554 --> 00:22:03.770
But it so happened that I was at the first cocktail party reception after the board meeting in which John Blocker had been sworn in and sat as a regent for the first time.

00:22:04.471 --> 00:22:05.132
Well, guess what?

00:22:05.993 --> 00:22:10.678
When I was in Navasota a few months earlier, maybe six months or a year,

00:22:11.131 --> 00:22:14.294
I had represented John's wife in a divorce.

00:22:15.335 --> 00:22:27.906
They had moved up to Mavisota when he was president of Dresser and had bought one of those wonderful, huge homes in Mavisota out by what is now the bypass, the old Moore home place.

00:22:29.047 --> 00:22:33.531
And Peggy was a very active part of the community.

00:22:34.211 --> 00:22:37.434
I was a very active part of the community.

00:22:37.454 --> 00:22:40.497
My law partner and I represented

00:22:41.101 --> 00:22:43.523
Peggy in the divorce.

00:22:45.245 --> 00:22:54.194
Happily, it had been a fairly calm and a divorce where John had been, in my opinion, a stand-up good guy, generous.

00:22:54.695 --> 00:22:59.800
Whenever lawyers begin to think that, they're usually in trouble because somebody's usually fooling them.

00:23:00.220 --> 00:23:01.361
But I didn't think so.

00:23:04.304 --> 00:23:06.246
Just another tribute to John.

00:23:06.306 --> 00:23:09.910
Many years later, or several years later,

00:23:11.527 --> 00:23:20.917
I was invited to a wedding of one of his boys down at St. John's Episcopal Church in River Oaks.

00:23:20.937 --> 00:23:22.399
My wife and I attended that.

00:23:23.480 --> 00:23:28.185
And we then went to the reception at River Oaks and a marvelous event.

00:23:29.026 --> 00:23:35.773
And his son and little wife were having their first dance.

00:23:35.973 --> 00:23:41.179
And John came around and sat by me and he said, Jimmy said, well, Peggy was there.

00:23:41.378 --> 00:23:43.140
the mother of these children were there.

00:23:43.601 --> 00:23:46.144
And John's new wife elected not to come.

00:23:46.605 --> 00:23:48.768
I thought it was a class act thing to do.

00:23:49.289 --> 00:23:57.059
Allowed the parents, you know, to not be bothered by third party new wife.

00:23:57.079 --> 00:24:01.606
And John came over and sat by me and he said, Jimmy, I want you to know something.

00:24:01.626 --> 00:24:08.295
That, you know, I've made a lot of money since the time that our divorce occurred.

00:24:08.315 --> 00:24:09.336
And he indeed had.

00:24:09.396 --> 00:24:10.778
He had made a lot of money

00:24:11.180 --> 00:24:35.365
in the drilling business and it generated that blocker drilling and gone on from dresser to become really wealthy he said i want you to know that i created a trust for pain because i just felt like by god i already do that she's the mother of my children and i had the good fortune of making

00:24:35.564 --> 00:24:38.568
most of my money after we married.

00:24:38.588 --> 00:24:41.151
And I just wanted to share that with you.

00:24:41.171 --> 00:24:44.255
Well, you know those stories last a long time.

00:24:44.275 --> 00:24:47.539
Tells you what people are made out of.

00:24:47.559 --> 00:24:52.305
Many people could give those kind of stories about John Blocker, but that's one of them.

00:24:52.325 --> 00:24:54.327
Alright, now you've been giving positive.

00:24:54.347 --> 00:25:00.795
Can you think of any interesting where you as a beginner stumbled, stumped your toe or something?

00:25:01.400 --> 00:25:07.007
I had the Zincraft case completely worked out with the Justice Department.

00:25:07.027 --> 00:25:20.265
And to work out what I thought we had to do, I had the players in my puzzle were Jarvis Miller, who was a stiff-necked, hard-headed guy that didn't like to give an inch.

00:25:21.006 --> 00:25:31.339
And he wasn't keen on giving on this Justice Department beating us up over women in the Corps, women in the band, women in Rudders and Rangers, and so forth.

00:25:32.095 --> 00:25:50.894
But I had, with the help of John Coles and with the help of General Simpson and some others, Colonel Haney, we've gone through depositions and we've come to the realization that this matter needed to be resolved.

00:25:50.914 --> 00:26:01.545
And so I got from the Justice Department what it is that I thought was the bottom line, entry level,

00:26:02.048 --> 00:26:06.614
what maybe could help us get into a consent decree.

00:26:08.556 --> 00:26:30.182
From that, I developed a working paper of all these issues, and I tried to personalize them to ourselves so that if I got a working group together, that we could go through my set of issues that I had personalized

00:26:30.483 --> 00:26:33.548
So that everybody would understand them, where we live.

00:26:35.090 --> 00:26:38.034
And I had lawyers from the Attorney General's office.

00:26:38.055 --> 00:26:42.461
I mean, I had John Fainer, who was first Assistant Attorney General.

00:26:42.481 --> 00:26:47.889
I had Lonnie Zwiener, who was the expert on civil rights litigation, and his assistant.

00:26:47.930 --> 00:26:52.837
And I had Frank Denius, who was a volunteer, and his associate.

00:26:54.419 --> 00:26:59.427
I had five lawyers besides my two or three that were working on the case.

00:27:00.773 --> 00:27:15.310
We invited Regents to come and I got Jarvis, President Miller, to basically agree to those critical issues about how to make this work.

00:27:15.330 --> 00:27:19.114
Jarvis was okay.

00:27:19.134 --> 00:27:20.255
I got this group in.

00:27:20.295 --> 00:27:21.497
We spent all day long.

00:27:21.757 --> 00:27:23.579
Chairman Wells presided.

00:27:24.140 --> 00:27:26.983
I went through that thing from one end to the other.

00:27:27.453 --> 00:27:33.721
We answered every question, what we could live with, what we couldn't live with, what I need to modify in order to live with it.

00:27:34.622 --> 00:27:41.911
And we were in wonderful shape to resolve that lawsuit.

00:27:41.931 --> 00:27:45.015
So we have a board meeting that comes up.

00:27:46.176 --> 00:27:56.008
And we get to that point where I'm to make my presentation about what we have

00:27:56.512 --> 00:28:25.928
agreed on as a working group and joe bless his heart who was still head of a very powerful law firm in houston which was reynolds white allen cook joe had been a school lawyer you know with a h.i with the hisd and he was a known force and not to be argued with or for meetup

00:28:27.072 --> 00:28:43.494
try to outdo, I will say to you that I feel like, then and now, that I knew more about the current state of the law than he did about the issues and what that case really was about.

00:28:44.075 --> 00:28:51.966
But Joe took the personal privilege to rise to announce to the board that

00:28:52.604 --> 00:28:58.735
that case was winnable and that we were, and he took me on, one on one.

00:28:58.755 --> 00:29:06.629
I don't know who in the name of heaven gave me the authority to even be talking to the Justice Department on any basis associated with settling.

00:29:06.729 --> 00:29:10.035
We were not going to settle anything, now or ever.

00:29:10.737 --> 00:29:16.587
And it was in that same meeting that the board passed a resolution

00:29:17.748 --> 00:29:39.958
against doing it and after that I was placed in a another direction where Joe placed John Tyler of his firm in our group to well what happened was they came up with a bunch of haircut cases and some of the dress code cases

00:29:40.377 --> 00:30:05.035
that the feds had gotten tired of and the federal courts had begun to say you know we're tired of things and y'all resolve them and it was almost trying to trying to place our case in the same stance with the federal courts and it just wouldn't work but i took a took a heck of a beating that day and

00:30:06.213 --> 00:30:13.943
There were a lot of regents who had been at my workshop who knew that I didn't deserve what I got.

00:30:13.963 --> 00:30:22.855
But what I learned was that if you're going to represent a board, they're the board and you're not.

00:30:24.217 --> 00:30:31.747
And wherever they elect to go, you've got to be a policeman with respect to saying what you think the law is.

00:30:32.669 --> 00:30:34.431
But at some point,

00:30:35.120 --> 00:30:44.515
they do what they want to do so long as you've given them your best shot, that's all you can do.

00:30:44.996 --> 00:30:47.019
Then you represent a client.

00:30:47.039 --> 00:30:48.642
Now I hadn't thought about this case.

00:30:48.742 --> 00:30:49.423
Let's go back.

00:30:49.483 --> 00:30:51.726
I think this is an important topic.

00:30:52.307 --> 00:30:55.192
This case involves a young co-ed.

00:30:56.534 --> 00:31:01.482
I believe her father and stepfather both were bird colonels in the Air Force.

00:31:01.664 --> 00:31:05.568
She had come out of San Antonio out of a retired military background.

00:31:05.628 --> 00:31:15.439
And I think her mother was wheelchair bound and had reared this young lady not to back up to anything.

00:31:16.320 --> 00:31:24.670
And she came when co-education was beginning to be campus wide in every way.

00:31:24.710 --> 00:31:28.414
By that I mean we had had a number of years when

00:31:28.394 --> 00:31:49.828
women were here in limited numbers so would you kind of review the that that whole case our issue to be honest with you when we took depositions it really needs to be told somewhere the question
