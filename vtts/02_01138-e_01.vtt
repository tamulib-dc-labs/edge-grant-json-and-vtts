00:02.883 --> 00:07.349
I want to start the first chapter of the book with 
your early childhood. I have the letters that you

00:08.131 --> 00:22.231
wrote to me, which talk about a lot of your first 
impressions,

00:08.131 --> 00:22.231
which you remember, I think, sending me those, the 
ones about seeing the first time you saw a dead man,

00:08.131 --> 00:22.231
which is a very well-written piece. You remember 
that one? Yes, I do. Do you know one? Uh-huh. That

00:29.241 --> 00:31.124
was Tom Ruby. Uh-huh. And when Roy was talking 
about the old Culberson place, and I told you about

00:32.245 --> 00:39.635
the chimney. Yes, the chimney, right. That is the 
old Culberson place. It is. That's exactly right.

00:45.603 --> 00:47.105
Okay, that gives me a definition. That gives you a 
definition of exactly. Well, that was it. I'm

00:50.089 --> 00:55.536
going to send you, I'm going to go over to the Texas 
Highway Department and buy you a 35-cent, Blanco

00:55.955 --> 01:09.514
County map, and I will mail this to you with 
instructions that you take your crayons and color

00:55.955 --> 01:09.514
in areas which are significant to your 
upbringing, okay? I think that'll be fun, too, you

01:09.534 --> 01:11.216
know? You'll get a kick out of it. And, too, when we 
lived... Now, when Roy was telling about this old

01:12.779 --> 01:25.236
Culberson place, well, that was... We called it 
the old chimney place because the house... Well,

01:12.779 --> 01:25.236
it burned down... Soon after, well, I just don't 
know. See, we moved down there in 1912.

01:36.979 --> 01:41.186
And it must have been, it burned down about 1913 or 
1914. I don't know. I see. But anyway, right along

01:43.550 --> 01:44.611
in there. How old was the house? When was it built? 
Oh, my heavens. That old house was built in, oh,

01:47.075 --> 01:51.763
back in 18... I guess about 1860. Was it? One of the 
earliest? One of the very earliest houses is built

01:56.773 --> 02:00.878
in this country. Okay. And that was on the road to 
Cypress Mills. Yes, right. And they'd go through

02:08.447 --> 02:12.032
that way to go to dances. My mother and Aunt Mabel 
and Uncle Jay would go by the old Culberson place

02:12.873 --> 02:21.644
going to a dance. Right. I know something I want to 
ask you about. Let's go back. I want you to do a small

02:26.610 --> 02:30.855
genealogy chart also of your family.

02:33.659 --> 02:37.464
You know what I'm saying, the Chapman side, the 
Johnson side. Because you know you've got some

02:38.405 --> 02:40.428
German roots. I sure do, and I'm proud of them. That 
means I'm proud of all of them. told me one time,

02:46.435 --> 02:48.978
Scotch, Irish, and devil. I really realize that. I 
know that now. Scotch, Irish, and devil. I know

02:53.724 --> 02:55.787
that now as time goes on. I met some Scottish 
friends the other day, and I know I can see it very

02:55.847 --> 03:04.657
plainly. The Macintosh and the Macintyres and the 
Buttons were all Scotch. Irish. My grandmother

03:13.709 --> 03:14.890
was a Her mother was a Macintyre. And her mother was 
a Macintosh. So that pretty well puts the

03:21.252 --> 03:24.957
discussion... That pretty well puts me right in 
there. In the middle of it. And, of course, the

03:26.759 --> 03:31.526
Johnsons originally were sweet. When they came 
and... When England and Norway were... Having

03:34.530 --> 03:45.805
their trouble with the North Sea and whatnot, the 
Johnsons went into... England. And soon after

03:47.997 --> 03:56.368
they landed there, they dropped the T, Johnston, 
and made it Johnson. Yeah. I see. See, and then they

03:58.852 --> 04:02.216
came from there. I believe their first, well, it 
was four brothers of them that came over together.

04:11.409 --> 04:16.095
And one of them stopped in Boston. right at the 
Plymouth Rock, you might say. And the other one was

04:21.449 --> 04:33.907
down

04:21.449 --> 04:33.907
further on down New Jersey, one in Virginia. And, 
well, my grandparents, I am sure from what I can

04:39.110 --> 04:46.063
gather was one that stopped in Virginia. Yeah. And 
so that's

04:48.407 --> 04:56.562
and then of course they came on over into Kentucky 
and You know, Grandmother Johnson was born in

04:57.132 --> 05:00.777
Russellville, Kentucky. She was born in 
Russellville? Yes, ma'am. I've been there. Born

05:04.663 --> 05:06.425
in Russellville, Kentucky. How about that? Yes, 
sir. And then, well, my grandfather was born in

05:09.089 --> 05:14.496
Georgia. Uh-huh. And my

05:16.339 --> 05:25.812
great-grandfather Johnson was sheriff in 
Georgia. Uh-huh. Well, let's see what county it

05:26.714 --> 05:29.000
was at. Well, I have it. I'll put it, I'll send it to 
you. Okay, good. But anyway, he was sheriff there

05:32.409 --> 05:35.918
for years. I don't know. It must have been in the 
blood of the Johnsons to be in politics. Yeah. I

05:42.847 --> 05:43.868
think it was. Because he was sheriff, and he had a 
son that was sheriff, and Grandpa Johnson, he was

05:44.229 --> 05:52.879
just a trail drover. That was it, and a preacher. 
Boy, he knew his Bible. But I don't know. I know when

05:59.388 --> 06:09.260
they came to Texas, Grandfather preached a lot in 
Louisiana, too. Mm-hmm. Mississippi, as they

06:11.045 --> 06:13.049
came through. He was always a very religious man. 
He was a Baptist up until he went into the Christian

06:16.998 --> 06:23.051
church, which is a branch of the Puritan religion. 
But he preached along the way. He came along in the

06:27.920 --> 06:30.323
covered wagon. He was a preacher. Yeah, so that's 
very interesting. And then he went into the cattle

06:35.811 --> 06:38.694
industry right here. Why don't you tell me about 
just,

06:39.275 --> 06:48.227
well, I know I can look up a lot of information, but 
I'd rather hear it from you. Well, the only thing, I

06:48.247 --> 06:56.458
know that my first time grandfather came here was 
back in the early 50s. And I said the early 50s. I

06:59.903 --> 07:01.386
don't mean the early 50s. I mean the late 50s. And he 
brought that provost built the first cabin up

07:04.231 --> 07:12.566
there

07:04.231 --> 07:12.566
on the old Johnson Place. And grandfather bought 
it from provost. Uh-huh. And who was provost? The

07:20.944 --> 07:26.430
provost was just one of the first settlers in this 
part of the country. And the Wallers were early

07:27.591 --> 07:30.954
settlers here. The Criters, the Summys, 
provosts, Mays, Kletts, Kellys, Greens,

07:31.034 --> 07:44.968
Harringtons, Smiths. That gets about all of them. 
About everybody. About everybody. And they were

07:49.240 --> 07:52.724
all early settlers here. And then in 1858, 
grandfather bought. And we didn't have any wire

08:00.314 --> 08:05.161
fence laws at that time. And that is another thing 
that you went by marks of trees. and rocks and

08:17.303 --> 08:27.021
rivers as landmarks and boundaries for your land. 
And our deed, which God bless the little old Park's

08:27.041 --> 08:40.425
heart,

08:27.041 --> 08:40.425
says to, well they kept telling Corky rode the 
wagon, and they kept saying, this is Brookner

08:40.777 --> 08:44.904
property. Well, it was not. It was Sam Ely's 
property, and where the exhibit hall is was on the

08:46.888 --> 08:55.323
Sam Johnson property for grandfathers. The only 
little thing, you know where the chuck wagon is?

09:00.432 --> 09:00.593
Yes. That side of the creek, now. I said that side of 
the creek. Uh-huh. was Brookner's and up and where

09:05.650 --> 09:12.305
the old smokehouse, there was a straight line that 
went right straight out to the field. Now that was

09:12.626 --> 09:15.192
Brookner's. And they kept, I don't know, I can't 
understand why they can't look at their own deed

09:15.553 --> 09:23.170
and see that. But anyway, they didn't. They were 
just writing their own history. Yes, they were

09:27.825 --> 09:29.848
doing their own history. Anyway, they said Pope 
Johnson's barn wasn't there, but oh, it was. And it

09:37.638 --> 09:49.914
was there when grandmother was held under the 
house by the Indians because grandfather has told

09:37.638 --> 09:49.914
me that story many, many times. Why don't you tell 
me that story? Well, he had gone to get some stairs

09:55.111 --> 09:59.556
that he had bought from the Phelps's down on Miller 
Creek. About what time was this? It was in the fall

10:02.139 --> 10:12.211
of the year because they were going to make well I 
said fall is late summer. Probably in September.

10:13.793 --> 10:15.815
About this time of the year. And he was going and he 
went down there to bring the stairs that he had

10:16.556 --> 10:24.966
bought from the Phelps's to up to the old 
settlement house, which they call the old

10:26.397 --> 10:34.689
settlement place. It's the Johnson House. And he 
left grandmother there with Aunt Mary, who was the

10:37.312 --> 10:44.623
oldest child. And she was a person... that could 
shoot as well as any Indian and ride just as well.

10:57.754 --> 10:59.195
That's grandmother Bunton Johnson. Grandmother 
Bunton, Eliza Jane Bunton Johnson. And she was

11:04.039 --> 11:09.884
quite a lady. She was not a woman who talked a lot. 
But when she spoke, you listened. And what she had

11:23.148 --> 11:26.413
to say was worth it. And I can tell you one thing. She 
didn't tell you twice not to do something. She told

11:34.324 --> 11:43.317
you once, and if you did it, there was always a 
reason that she used that butter paddle. Mm-hmm.

11:44.190 --> 11:45.132
The butter paddle. The butter paddle. Oh, or that 
old wooden spoon. Man, why that hurt. Okay. I well

11:51.046 --> 11:52.449
remember that. The butter paddle and wooden 
spoon. And I didn't get but two of them. And that was

11:57.260 --> 12:00.247
all it took. For your grandmother. For my 
grandmother. Right. Well, my grandfather didn't

12:03.293 --> 12:06.919
think I ever deserved anything like that. No. I'd 
have never gotten a spanking. I'll guarantee you

12:11.826 --> 12:12.928
that. Well, anyway, that day when the Indians 
came. And the Indians came, and Grandmother

12:15.251 --> 12:18.376
crawled under the house. Well, she was down at the 
spring getting water. And we dug that spring out

12:21.421 --> 12:24.345
and made that hole of water. Now, is that the spring 
that's right behind you? Right. Your old house

12:26.969 --> 12:28.071
there? Old, yes. Right down there by the exhibit 
center. Right. And that was the string that was on

12:31.236 --> 12:33.901
top of the ground. But it had a hole dug out to get 
water. But anyway, we dug that thing out to

12:38.148 --> 12:41.694
irrigate with. Yeah, and you had the pecans. And 
the pecans, yeah. In the early 20s. Well,

12:46.974 --> 12:51.520
grandmother's down there getting water and she 
looked out across the flat. That's the reason I

12:51.560 --> 12:56.947
told you a while ago we didn't have these cedars and 
we didn't have all that. Right, you had the flat

12:56.967 --> 12:58.470
grassland. Grassland. And she saw these Indians 
coming. And she ran to the house and grabbed little

13:02.836 --> 13:11.107
Mary and right in front of that fireplace was a trap 
door. Yes. And there was a root cellar under the

13:12.194 --> 13:23.934
house, not a big old thing, but a root cellar is all 
it was where she put her things. And lots of times,

13:24.055 --> 13:31.528
that's where she kept a lot of her groceries to keep 
the Indians from stealing them. What kind of

13:31.548 --> 13:33.010
Indians were these? The Comanches. Comanches. 
When she heard them coming, she grabbed little

13:36.680 --> 13:44.950
Mary and the diapers out and crawled under there 
and just pulled this door down. It had an old rug in

13:45.031 --> 13:46.853
front of it. And it didn't show to be a door or 
anything because the floor was pieced all the way

13:47.374 --> 14:00.230
across with lumber, but only part of it came up. And 
that was because of the way it was built. And you

14:03.865 --> 14:05.487
didn't know it was a door. And she got down there, 
and she kept little Mary in. These Indians stole so

14:10.113 --> 14:29.316
many of her wedding gifts, and all of the supplies 
that Grandfather had gotten from Austin to go on

14:10.113 --> 14:29.316
this cattle drive, he and Uncle Tom, and she knew 
that Little Mary would cry and wake them and she

14:29.650 --> 14:38.530
tied a diaper around her mouth so that it would 
muffle the cry. And she could hear the Indians

14:38.830 --> 14:43.876
taking the things out of the house. She could hear 
them going through her trunk and everything. And

14:47.340 --> 14:55.369
she heard the cattle stampede at the barn, and she 
knew that they were driving them off or doing

14:47.340 --> 14:55.369
something. She couldn't tell what. And she heard 
the horses when they broke out of the pen and they

14:57.572 --> 15:02.257
opened the gate. They stole a couple of his saddle 
horses, and they killed a beef. and took it and it

15:08.412 --> 15:35.668
was after night when grandfather came in and he 
knew that something was wrong because the cattle

15:08.412 --> 15:35.668
sat and he knew the horses was out and all out and 
around the place and he knew there was something

15:08.412 --> 15:35.668
wrong and he came in and he hollered Eliza Eliza 
where are you are you here he went back to the barn

15:08.412 --> 15:35.668
and He called for Uncle Tom and he said, Tom, where 
are you? And Tom said, I'm rounding up the stock,

15:40.296 --> 15:43.799
bringing them back to the pen. He says, come on, 
we've got to find Liza. Indians have been here.

15:48.143 --> 15:49.284
They've killed a beef. The horses are gone. We've 
got to find Liza and Mary, little Mary. And Uncle

15:56.111 --> 15:59.073
Tom said, well, have you looked at the house? And he 
said, she's not there. She didn't answer me. He

16:02.176 --> 16:04.018
said, well, let's go back and to the house and see. 
He said, she might be around there and we might find

16:06.440 --> 16:10.686
her. And so grandfather came in and he said, Eliza, 
and she didn't answer. Called Eliza again. He

16:19.640 --> 16:21.102
stomped his boot heel. He says, Eliza Jane Button, 
if you're here, answer me. And when he said Eliza

16:26.871 --> 16:30.276
Jane Button, she answered. And he said, well, why 
didn't you answer me before? She said, Sam Ely, an

16:34.190 --> 16:43.679
Indian can mimic anything, and I knew no one knew 
that my name was Eliza Jane but you. And that's the

16:44.780 --> 16:47.402
reason I answered. Oh, how about that, yeah. And 
the only reason I answered was because you called

16:48.764 --> 16:55.170
me Eliza Jane Button, and that's the reason I 
answered. Well, soon after that, they had the

16:56.130 --> 16:58.913
Battle of Deer Creek. And the wounded were taken 
there to the house. Well, grandmother didn't have

17:03.582 --> 17:06.675
any cotton. Now, what year was that? I can't 
remember. I know what the Battle of Deer Creek was,

17:10.038 --> 17:15.387
but I don't have it written down, so I can't. I can't 
tell you. I can look it up. It was in the 60s, so early

17:18.372 --> 17:21.176
part. The Battle of Deer Creek, was that because 
the Phelps were murdered? That was before. I mean,

17:26.204 --> 17:33.336
after the Phelpses were murdered, the Phelpses 
were scalped first. Yeah. And then the Battle of

17:34.043 --> 17:35.527
Deer Creek. Then the Battle of Deer Creek. The 
Dolly Heights were killed at Round Mountain also.

17:39.096 --> 17:40.419
Now, I'm not familiar with that. Well, the Dolly 
Heights were on their way to church. Uh-huh. And

17:44.229 --> 17:48.279
that's Emmett Redford's great-grandfather. Oh, 
really? You bet. Whoa, okay. And they were, his

17:51.593 --> 17:56.398
mother was a Dolly Hyde. A Dolly Hyde. Yes, Emmett 
Redford's mother was a Dolly Hyde. Okay, all

18:00.203 --> 18:02.005
right. And Emmett Redford's mother taught me one 
year in declamations, and I won in the county, went

18:02.025 --> 18:13.077
to the district. And I recited a poem that Daniel 
Webster wrote. Oh, you did? Mm-hmm. Which was

18:19.365 --> 18:20.165
that? It was that. the nation, our nation, and he 
said, God grant that I shall not see a divided

18:21.682 --> 18:37.541
nation, that this curtain shall never rise again. 
It's a beautiful poem, and it is so true. You'll

18:43.079 --> 18:47.328
have to go back. That happened first? Yeah, before 
the Battle of Deer Creek. Now, the Dolly Heights

18:53.581 --> 18:58.993
were killed and the Phelps were scalped. Then the 
Battle of Deer Creek. Then the Battle of Deer

19:00.716 --> 19:01.999
Creek. Well, grandmother put under the cabin 
before any of that. Yeah, she went under the cabin

19:05.284 --> 19:09.249
before any of all that happened. All that 
happened. This all led up to the Battle of Deer

19:10.351 --> 19:12.714
Creek. This all led up to that. And that's when they 
chased them out to Pack Saddle Mountain. That's

19:16.660 --> 19:17.021
right. Isn't that correct? Yes, sir. And you had 
some rangers come in on that? Yes, sir. And what was

19:20.385 --> 19:21.327
that about? I remember. Well, they just was trying 
to rid them out of the country. Just chasing them

19:25.373 --> 19:26.174
out. Just chasing them out. That is all. And... 
Captain Ruth Perry. And his old cabin is right up

19:32.850 --> 19:35.454
here in town. Uh-huh. Which one is that? Minnie Cox 
has her. Minnie Cox's house is Perry's cabin.

19:43.025 --> 19:43.686
Cabin. Old Ruth Perry's cabin. You bet your bottom 
dollar. I see. Okay. And I can't, law me alive. You

19:53.080 --> 20:00.290
know, I tell you, whenever you stop to think about 
it, Uh-huh. Uh, When Ruth Perry came to visit,

20:00.890 --> 20:07.029
Grandfather, little folks have big ears. And I'd 
sit and listen to those Indian tales. Really? Be

20:11.984 --> 20:14.787
scared to death and couldn't go to sleep that 
night. And Grandma and Grandpa, me and I'd have to

20:14.928 --> 20:19.834
go and crawl in bed, and I'd get between them. The 
Indians would get me every time he'd come. But I'd

20:23.839 --> 20:26.001
want another story. I'd want him to tell me another 
story. And I'd sit and listen. Tell me about your

20:29.526 --> 20:37.816
relationship to your grandfather, Johnson, and 
to Eliza, the time you did spend with them. And I

20:37.836 --> 20:39.638
think you've told me about... Uncle Jesse, too. 
Oh, Uncle Jesse was the one that really played a

20:40.941 --> 20:44.470
very important part. And I want to hear about him 
again. He was whose? He was Grandpa Johnson's

20:46.997 --> 20:49.724
brother. Grandpa Johnson. Tom. Tom and Sam and 
Jesse were all brothers. And Jesse was in the Civil

20:56.950 --> 20:58.453
War. Uh-huh. Fought for the South, of course. So 
did Grandfather. So did Uncle Tom. Right. All

21:03.986 --> 21:05.048
three of them. All three of them. Okay. And Uncle 
Jesse got his leg shot off. And you're very

21:09.297 --> 21:11.622
sensitive about that. Yeah. And I... You tell me 
about Uncle Jesse. He seems to be one of my favorite

21:16.914 --> 21:20.057
characters, too. He was one of the sweetest men 
that ever lived. He's a man that loved nature. And I

21:26.584 --> 21:30.087
think that's where it was really instilled in me. 
We lived back behind Grandfather, up in about, oh,

21:30.788 --> 21:40.118
I guess a good mile from where Lyndon lived, back 
to... three-quarter of a mile from Grandfather

21:40.925 --> 21:43.508
Johnson. And every afternoon, it would be Uncle 
Jesse would go down. And we had a field. We lived out

21:54.621 --> 21:59.647
in the field, and the well was close to the house. 
But the pasture had a lane that led down and a wooden

21:59.667 --> 22:07.877
gap that we let the cows through. and out into the 
pasture, and we'd drive them in. And it had flowers

22:11.787 --> 22:16.073
and everything in this lane. To me, I can see the 
buttercups and the phlox and the hollyhocks and

22:16.093 --> 22:29.511
winecups and balimony and all kinds of beautiful 
flowers in this lane. And we'd take old Dink, was

22:29.572 --> 22:37.122
the name of the old milk cow, and we'd take her down 
and put her out and in. Uncle Jesse took a lot of

22:38.249 --> 22:46.737
pride and a lot of time in teaching me poetry. Now 
let me tell you something. When they say that

22:49.840 --> 22:59.130
children don't learn

22:49.840 --> 22:59.130
until they're a certain age, that's a bunch of 
baloney. Because I know that I wasn't three years

22:59.710 --> 23:04.355
old and I was reciting poetry. I believe that. And 
the first... poem that I ever learned that he ever

23:07.949 --> 23:37.888
taught me I have a secret just wait for you Wobbin 
and I in the sweet cherry tree because Wobbin knows

23:07.949 --> 23:37.888
it best because he built a little oh I can't tell the 
rest I'm afraid I'll tell it every minute and he

23:07.949 --> 23:37.888
laid the four little somethings in Oh,

23:38.493 --> 23:47.563
the secret, I'm afraid I'll fail.

23:47.583 --> 23:53.489
And I can remember reciting that for Uncle Jesse 
just as well as anything. He told me why the robins

23:54.170 --> 24:06.863
laid four eggs, why the doves only had two, why the 
dove nest was so poorly built. That all stemmed

24:08.108 --> 24:12.232
back from the Bible and the history of time. This 
had nothing to do with, yet they scrapped from the

24:12.852 --> 24:21.520
ark. Oh, is that so? Those things. And then there 
was, he'd teach me to sing, I'll lay away a suit of

24:23.882 --> 24:32.649
gray to wear to the Union blue. I don't know. I 
cherished those memories. I only wish I had

24:39.727 --> 24:46.177
listened and paid a little bit more attention, but 
I always had something else to do. He would tell me

24:47.259 --> 25:03.023
why the flowers had different colors, what made 
them bloom when they did, why the wine cup was

24:47.259 --> 25:03.023
called a wine cup, why the buttercup was called a 
buttercup. They don't call it buttercup anywhere

25:05.483 --> 25:10.848
but in Texas, I don't think. They call it the 
scarlet columbine

25:10.868 --> 25:16.934
and things like that. But we call it buttercup. And 
he'd pull the buttercup off and stick it to my nose

25:19.217 --> 25:26.024
and all that yellow pollen would be around. He'd 
say, got butter on your nose? Just tickle me to

25:28.346 --> 25:30.548
death. And those are things that I remember so well 
with Uncle Jesse. And he took time to swing me. And

25:39.753 --> 25:41.754
I'd say, swing me high. And he would swing me high. 
And he would sing that old spiritual, swing low

25:46.138 --> 25:50.702
sweet chariot. For some reason, the Johnsons all 
liked to sing. And they all liked music. And he

25:58.248 --> 25:59.789
could really sing. And could he play the, what did 
they call it? French harp, juicer. No, the juice

26:04.860 --> 26:07.442
harp is something else. You flip it, but you can't. 
No, this is the harmonica. That's what he, and he

26:13.208 --> 26:14.890
could play that. And man, it was something else.

26:21.377 --> 26:27.624
But Uncle Jesse was quite a character, and he told 
me lots about the battles. He did. And how he...

26:31.293 --> 26:33.556
about getting his leg shot off. Do you remember 
that? Yes, and he was taken in in a wagon, and he was

26:35.037 --> 26:58.684
covered up with a wagon sheet that they had and a 
bunch of provisions that were left behind, just

26:35.037 --> 26:58.684
throwed on top of him to keep the enemy from finding 
that he was wound it in there and he was taking

26:59.052 --> 27:24.351
something i believe he said 20 miles to 
chattanooga to be to have this to the hospital a

26:59.052 --> 27:24.351
hospital to have that leg finished amputating he 
said it was just barely hanging and he asked

26:59.052 --> 27:24.351
someone to cut it off and they wouldn't but they did 
tie uh well he said they cut a part of his shirt tail

27:25.411 --> 27:43.808
and tied it in string to put around as a tourniquet 
around that leg to keep him from bleeding to death

27:25.411 --> 27:43.808
from his own shirt and he was quite He must have been 
in a mighty bad shape when he got there. And from

27:50.089 --> 27:57.843
what he told me, tell about having nothing to eat 
but hard tack. And of course, I didn't know what

27:57.864 --> 28:00.468
hard tack was. One day my mother made a failure. a 
complete failure in her biscuits, and he called it

28:03.211 --> 28:07.736
heart attack. And I can remember that. It was 
awful. It was so hard. She forgot to put the grease

28:12.442 --> 28:15.426
in it, she told me. And so that... Didn't you tell me 
he taught you how to count? Oh, my goodness. You

28:22.354 --> 28:23.415
have to tell me that story. I love that story. About 
the bedpost? I love that one. I have forgotten. Cut

28:34.288 --> 28:35.349
that thing off. See if I can remember. I forget 
every time. This bed that Uncle Jesse had was a

28:40.255 --> 28:51.328
four-poster bed, and it had been cut in rings like 
around it. It was made out of black walnut. And I

28:53.991 --> 29:00.859
believe, if I'm not badly mistaken, and I don't 
think I am, Dr. Perry at Fredericksburg has that in

29:01.396 --> 29:06.508
that old two-story house. And he bought it from 
Oriole. And Uncle Jesse, it was his, given to Aunt

29:09.656 --> 29:17.835
Kate. Aunt Kate was Oriole's mother, and so I'm 
sure that that's where that bed is. But anyway, I

29:24.451 --> 29:25.954
learned to count. I would get up, but never could I. 
I could get up to five, and I'd forget what six was

29:26.415 --> 29:32.987
every time. So one day he told me, he said, six, 
remember you're sick. You're a sick little girl

29:39.888 --> 29:41.951
when you get there. You're going to be sick because 
I'm going to pat you if you don't get over it. Well, I

29:45.437 --> 29:47.300
got there, and I said, I'm sick. And he said, no, 
you're six. All right, that's how I learned six.

29:54.491 --> 29:58.177
And so then we got on, and I could count to 10. And 
then from 10, he'd say, 10 and one more. And he'd

30:03.005 --> 30:04.767
hold up two fingers. And then I'd have to count the 
next bedpost. And that was the way it rings around

30:07.985 --> 30:10.808
it. Well, this bedpost had 10 on it. And then it'd be 
10 and one would be 11. And I learned how to write

30:17.896 --> 30:24.844
those just because he'd say, what's the next one 
now? It was a two, wasn't it? Well, you've got the 10

30:26.125 --> 30:27.707
over here. You've got to put that one down. And then 
put your two down. And you've got your 10 over here,

30:32.639 --> 30:36.543
and you're just adding on to it. Now, you'll 
remember that, he'd say. You've already got your

30:39.446 --> 30:40.667
10. You're just adding one more to it, or you're 
adding two more to it. It's 10 and 2. 10 and 3. Well,

30:46.874 --> 30:47.995
that's 13. And that's how I was taught to count the 
bedpost circles. 10 and 3. And they say today you

30:55.603 --> 31:00.768
have modern math. Uh-uh. It's been here always.

31:06.485 --> 31:07.666
Right. Let me think of some more things. I remember 
in the letter that you wrote me about when you were

31:10.069 --> 31:16.715
born, because you're the first grandchild. I was 
the first granddaughter born in the Johnson

31:17.196 --> 31:23.983
family and the first grandchild born in the 
Chapman family. Tom Martin was the oldest

31:25.204 --> 31:28.347
grandson born. in the Johnson family. He was 
several years older, I guess, 12 years older than I

31:30.023 --> 31:33.527
was. That was Mary's husband? That was Frank. I 
mean, Frank. Okay. I need to get the children

31:38.754 --> 31:40.215
straight. Eliza and Sam had how many children? 
Nine. Nine. Aunt Mary was the oldest, and she died.

31:48.145 --> 31:54.213
She was a music teacher, and she married a walling, 
and she went west. Well, she had TB. And she went to

31:56.423 --> 31:59.568
El Paso, and there's where she died. Then Aunt 
Frank married Clarence Martin, was the second

32:00.349 --> 32:05.558
one. And then Aunt Lucy married Sterling Price 
from Blanco. Then Aunt Ava... married John Harvey

32:18.108 --> 32:20.150
Bright. She was a school teacher, and she was 
teaching at Granbury, taught at Granbury. And

32:26.035 --> 32:35.103
then she taught at Beaumont, and there is where she 
met Uncle John Harvey and married him. Well, and

32:35.884 --> 32:40.888
she taught at Port Arthur also.

32:41.669 --> 32:47.794
But she was really... Well, in 1905, when they had 
the... Normal Institute from St. Marcus over here

32:48.095 --> 32:52.922
at Brown Mountain. She made the highest average of 
anyone in her class. And that was in what year?

33:00.452 --> 33:00.653
1905. 1905. Mm-hmm. A long time ago. Yeah, but I 
know where that building is. Yes, you know where

33:07.042 --> 33:11.187
the building is, and that's a landmark in the 
county. And I have... It should be represented by

33:12.269 --> 33:15.213
Stan Mark somehow. Somehow. They should have a... 
Well, I don't know... They've changed hands so

33:18.335 --> 33:20.638
many times. That's another institute that at one 
time it was a progressive, but seems to me like that

33:20.699 --> 33:32.015
politics or something's happened. I don't know 
what's happened to it, but it's not the same old

33:32.055 --> 33:35.981
school it used to be. Listen, after Ava, who was the 
next child? After Aunt Ava came Sam.

33:47.950 --> 34:05.824
And then I believe

33:47.950 --> 34:05.824
Uncle Sam, and then my daddy, then Aunt Kate, then 
Uncle George. Then Aunt Jessie. And Aunt Jessie

34:08.082 --> 34:12.066
was the only one living when Lyndon was president. 
Oh, really? That's the picture that we had made in

34:13.027 --> 34:17.872
Air Force One. She and I were the only Johnson 
attending the inauguration.

34:25.059 --> 34:30.344
I was the oldest grandchild, and she was the only 
one living. And she was the only aunt. And he had our

34:34.441 --> 34:37.384
picture made while I'm sitting. That's 
beautiful, yeah. If you well can see, sitting in

34:38.665 --> 34:41.288
his lap. We'll have to use that picture, too. 
That's a nice photograph of all of you. But they

34:46.373 --> 34:49.717
couldn't understand why. I said, if you'll just 
look back at all the pictures, I'm just always as

34:50.097 --> 34:57.205
close to him as I can be. And that one, sitting in his 
lap. Yeah, for sure. Yeah. So that was the family.

35:06.367 --> 35:15.659
The picture hanging in the boyhood home of us in 
1916, I'm holding Lennon's little sister. Which

35:16.280 --> 35:17.281
one that was? That was Lucia. Lucia. She was born in 
1916. I'm holding her. So what year were you born?

35:25.352 --> 35:25.832
What day? What hour? Well, the day and hour... I was 
born in 1905 at 6

35:31.816 --> 35:45.201
o'clock in the afternoon, the hottest day my 
mother said it could ever be. In the month of?

35:48.456 --> 35:48.916
August. August. The 2nd. The 2nd. I'm a Leo. I get 
along well with Leos, okay. I'm a Leo. Yes. Well,

35:59.827 --> 36:11.918
grandfather didn't go up the river hollering

35:59.827 --> 36:11.918
that a Florence Nightingale was being born or 
anything like that. But I can well remember He

36:16.535 --> 36:19.901
said, well, I have a little queen now. I was called 
his little queen in Calico. Which, that was very

36:26.032 --> 36:28.336
true. I was treated like a little queen, as far as 
he's concerned. I did no wrong. The girls with

36:34.406 --> 36:36.590
grandfather did no wrong. The boys did. The girls 
did. But the girls didn't. So you and Margaret were

36:41.948 --> 36:43.573
spoiled? Very much so. I was three years old. My 
grandfather had bought me a horse and saddle. When

36:49.890 --> 36:50.632
you were three? When I was three. That's something 
very important because the early age that you were

36:51.455 --> 36:56.970
taught to ride My goodness in life. Think about a 
child three years old riding a mile after mail and

36:59.152 --> 37:05.518
crossing a river. Would your parents let you do 
that today? No, but it was necessary for survival

37:08.241 --> 37:18.571
that even the youngest children in a county like 
this, an isolated community, know that sort of

37:08.241 --> 37:18.571
thing. Is that right? You mighty well believe. And 
we knew to ride. We knew how to ride.

37:27.224 --> 37:38.764
Why, I can remember that grandfather gave me, and 
my saddle was made, it had a great big horn, what we

37:27.224 --> 37:38.764
called a Mexican saddle horn. He told me, he said, 
if you have to grab a hold of something, sister, you

37:41.409 --> 37:48.962
can't hold on to that horn. Grab that string on the 
side. I know what string you mean, right? So I never

37:56.158 --> 37:59.402
was taught to hold on to a saddle. That wasn't my cup 
of tea. Right. From little. I have a pair of spurs

38:05.190 --> 38:10.877
that my grandmother gave me, engraved Eliza on. 
She has, and I gave them to the park thinking they'd

38:11.699 --> 38:17.426
appreciate them and they'd put them up, and 
they've never been put out. So I don't know where

38:17.526 --> 38:19.489
they are. They're a lot. They're cataloged to 
uselessness. I guess they are cataloged to

38:24.320 --> 38:27.004
uselessness. Right. I didn't have a 
granddaughter. I mean, at that time, I mean, well,

38:29.727 --> 38:35.374
Debbie, I could have given them to her. I have one. I 
gave her. I have one left. I couldn't find it, but.

38:42.993 --> 38:48.764
In moving, never having moved in 58 years, in 
moving this time, I found it. So I've got one. I'll

38:49.826 --> 38:51.049
give it to Debbie. I didn't give her the pair. I just 
had the one when I gave it to the partner. I would say

38:55.698 --> 38:57.721
another question here. You learned how to survive 
in a man's world as well as in a woman's world. I sure

39:03.698 --> 39:04.560
did. You had no choice. Your mother, of course, 
would have been in the same tradition because

39:05.562 --> 39:14.240
pioneer women had no choice but to survive in an 
equal world with their men. That was another thing

39:16.245 --> 39:18.730
Uncle Taxi taught me to do. What was this? It was 
every evening we'd go down this trail, we had

39:19.712 --> 39:23.901
shoemake. that grew out around. And the life of a 
shoemake tree is quite short. And we'd go over and

39:30.220 --> 39:37.210
we'd break off just so much to start our fire with 
the next morning. And from a little child, I have

39:37.931 --> 39:46.604
been taking in kindling and things to start a fire 
with in the morning. And let me tell you something.

39:49.267 --> 39:52.412
The old folks didn't let their fire die out. 
Uh-huh. We didn't have matches. So you kept that

39:55.740 --> 39:58.082
fire going all the time. You kept that fire going 
all the time. And you'd bank it in the summertime.

40:02.867 --> 40:09.653
You'd bank it at night, cover it up with ashes so 
you'd have a coal to start with the next morning.

40:09.673 --> 40:11.855
Because your flame is what kept you cooking. 
That's right. Laundry and all these things.

40:15.018 --> 40:15.778
Everything. That's right. And he was the very one 
that taught me how to break it off, where to get it.

40:26.382 --> 40:29.986
And we didn't have cedar in those days.

40:32.549 --> 40:35.633
We had shoemake to start our fire with. And he would 
use the shoemake and then dry leaves. And I'd bring

40:43.181 --> 40:49.288
in, I'd find dry leaves or something and I'd bring 
it in to my mother and put it down. And a corn cob. But

40:51.867 --> 40:55.914
listen, we didn't use but one or two corn cobs at a 
time. Why is that?

41:00.141 --> 41:08.155
Well, we would use them the year round to start 
fires with if our fire went out. And coal oil was

41:08.793 --> 41:11.879
what we used to put in the land. Now then, this fuzz 
on the outside of a corn cob would ignite and catch

41:11.899 --> 41:20.657
quick. So you would take about a teaspoon full of 
coal oil and string it up and down this corn cob. and

41:27.912 --> 41:33.398
then put it in there to start your fire with, and it 
would burn. That would catch, and it would really

41:33.459 --> 41:39.606
catch on fire and burn, and it would dry out and burn 
real good. And you saved your corn top, so you'd be

41:40.267 --> 41:46.354
sure to have one all year round. I see. Very good. 
Green corn cobs don't burn. No, they have to be your

41:52.071 --> 41:53.874
dry corn cobs. You bet. They sure do. And you know, 
something else Uncle Jesse taught me. We had to

41:59.265 --> 42:03.734
shell our own corn to go to market to take our meal. 
And I didn't know what the nubbit meant. But he

42:08.750 --> 42:12.438
would say, now I'll shuck it, sister. You take all 
of the bad ones off of the end. All the bad ones off

42:16.086 --> 42:19.634
down here at the butt. Now there's a tussle end and 
the butt end. Right. All right. The ones at the butt

42:24.024 --> 42:27.191
end are usually hard and slick. Yeah. Don't ever 
put that in your meal because it doesn't make good

42:28.375 --> 42:35.022
cornmeal and it doesn't rise good. So you had to 
take all of that off. Well, that was put in a bucket.

42:40.047 --> 42:46.995
All of this up here that was around the edge might be 
worm-eaten or it was never good. You'd shell all of

42:47.375 --> 42:51.219
that off until it was real good and you'd put that in 
a bucket. That's what you fed your chickens. Oh, so

42:54.093 --> 42:55.817
that was nubbing? Is that what you called it? Yes. 
Nubbing the corn? Nubbing the corn, and you fed it

42:57.882 --> 43:01.431
to the chickens. Very good. Sure. Makes sense. 
Now, I'm telling you. Now, those are things that

43:05.862 --> 43:08.127
are very. Those are things that I learned when I 
was. Are you the old? Yeah, under the age of five.

43:14.121 --> 43:15.763
Yes, under the age of five. Your early upbringing 
was concentrated for your survival. That was

43:19.608 --> 43:21.330
right. Which is something that people don't 
realize about Blanco County and Texas being

43:21.430 --> 43:29.320
isolated as it was at that particular time. I want 
to tell you one thing. You were taught, like when

43:31.803 --> 43:37.330
your mother built a fire around the wash pot, you'd 
like to see, she'd take a shovel full of ashes and

43:37.883 --> 43:49.020
throw it up to see which way the wind was. Oh, 
really? That's right, to be sure that she got the

43:50.823 --> 43:53.687
right wind. And that's where you'd build your 
fire, where the wind would blow the fire under the

43:54.469 --> 43:59.617
wash pot. Then you'd put something, if you 
happened to be fortunate enough, that you had a old

44:06.115 --> 44:11.815
piece of tin, which is scarce as hen's teeth. But if 
you had anything that you could hold the heat,

44:11.955 --> 44:18.117
you'd put it around that pot and hold the heat. And 
it would be my job to carry it, go hunt little sticks

44:18.772 --> 44:23.177
and little things. But I didn't go put them in the 
fire. That was a no-no. I piled them down here. My

44:28.083 --> 44:29.105
mother did that. Because there's an art to 
building a fire. There's an art to building a fire.

44:33.650 --> 44:36.714
And we didn't have a whole lot of wood that we could 
go get. Only a way out in the pasture. And our daddy

44:39.097 --> 44:41.560
had to haul it in the wagon. And we took very special 
pains in using it. How much we used and what we used.

44:48.048 --> 44:48.188
Mm-hmm. Sure. To conserve our wood. We don't do 
that today. So most of this early, early childhood

44:55.057 --> 44:59.723
was spent in Stonewall, isn't that right? Yes, 
that's right. That's right there on the river. On

45:04.809 --> 45:06.691
the Perlin Allis River. Where the present-day 
ranch is now. Well, that's up the way. We call that

45:12.538 --> 45:15.222
the big house. Uncle Clarence lived in that. 
Right, okay. And now when they say the Bailey

45:17.845 --> 45:20.368
Lane... When they go by the bus and say the Bailey 
Link. That house that's sitting over there is

45:23.253 --> 45:29.282
exactly like the house that I lived in. And it's 
Cousin Oriole's. My house burned down. But the one

45:33.128 --> 45:37.676
that I was brought up in burned down. But you can see 
it from the boyhood home. I mean the birthplace.

45:42.343 --> 45:44.787
You can see the... windmill and the trees around 
it. That's one thing about the people in the hill

45:48.655 --> 45:51.880
country. They built their houses where there was 
trees that would keep it cool. And they didn't

45:57.148 --> 46:01.654
build it out in the broad open spaces. They had 
trees in their yard.
