WEBVTT

00:20.720 --> 00:21.060
Hello? Yeah, I'm sorry. I haven't... The 
dictaphone, one of the tapes wouldn't inject. I'm

00:27.189 --> 00:27.569
sorry. But, um, so... So you're talking about they 
didn't have, um... They weren't being imprisoned

00:34.078 --> 00:40.206
because... Yeah.

00:48.958 --> 00:49.098
Uh-huh. Uh-huh.

00:52.343 --> 01:07.020
work

00:52.343 --> 01:07.020
processes, agriculture, producing, bar, so 
forth, they were then able to provide a surplus and

00:52.343 --> 01:07.020
really class it over. Then it was possible to say, 
no, we won't kill it, no, we'll turn it into slaves.

01:11.706 --> 01:15.010
They worked for us because no matter what, we live, 
we get it by working hard to produce some surplus

01:11.706 --> 01:15.010
that'll go to us. But how does that...

01:15.260 --> 01:38.995
Thou shalt not kill became the rule. Instead of 
killing your foe, you turn them into slaves, and

01:39.015 --> 01:41.539
from one country after another, slavery is 
developed. And then, however, the slave system

01:41.559 --> 01:45.064
reached a point where it became unproductive, or 
counterproductive is the word, to continue

01:41.559 --> 01:45.064
slavery because there were slavery goals because

01:45.382 --> 01:59.523
the slaves were getting organized and fighting in 
order to gain the freedom. Furthermore, they

01:59.543 --> 02:07.314
found that it was possible to produce more by 
giving some right to people on the land in certain

01:59.543 --> 02:07.314
areas where they could kill on the subject. This 
was theirs. The

02:08.062 --> 02:13.640
serfs were there. However, they had to pay a 
certain percentage of the sharecropping of what

02:13.660 --> 02:18.957
they produced to the landlord. So what happened 
was it was slavery . And

02:22.000 --> 02:38.748
then

02:22.000 --> 02:38.748
finally, I don't want to spend too much time on it, 
but I'd have to say the process of first

02:22.000 --> 02:38.748
development reached the point where you had the 
development of capitalist society. Now, what the

02:38.768 --> 02:41.933
Marxists have done, well, of course, we believe 
that society started with permits, you know,

02:38.768 --> 02:41.933
society, but it's going to go up to the US. will

02:42.318 --> 02:56.412
be

02:42.318 --> 02:56.412
also a communal society that's no longer 
permanent. I see. It will be a communal society

02:56.572 --> 03:01.376
where the productive force will reach the point 
where it is possible for people to live and that

02:56.572 --> 03:01.376
there's a system. Yeah. I see. Okay. Yeah. Well, I 
was going to ask, were there any... So you were

03:04.499 --> 03:09.304
influenced by the people that you listened to on 
street corners and by going... to the Young

03:09.757 --> 03:21.050
Workers League meetings and from, yeah, your 
labor? Being a Jew, were you discriminated

03:22.391 --> 03:26.856
against?

03:34.685 --> 03:34.785
Yeah.

03:41.380 --> 03:44.465
Uh-huh.

03:47.851 --> 04:03.456
I'm...

04:26.082 --> 04:27.163
Yeah.

04:30.547 --> 04:37.534
And also when you worked for Mr. Barlow and they 
tried to make you work on a Saturday or Sunday, your

04:30.547 --> 04:37.534
only day off.

04:43.119 --> 04:48.545
No, but as far as workers being... Yeah. After

04:48.565 --> 04:55.752
we worked six days... Yeah.

05:24.644 --> 05:24.844
All right. You and your wife, Lil, were members of 
the Communist Party when... And you were... Why

05:25.887 --> 05:37.341
were you one of the 11 to be...

05:39.263 --> 05:39.543
Yes. Yeah. Why didn't they pick Lil, or why didn't 
they...

05:41.686 --> 05:54.501
Well, they picked the top leaders of the party, so 
they picked the members of the National Board

05:41.686 --> 05:54.501
of... I see. The National Board of... 12 members. 
And I was one of them. I

05:56.127 --> 06:07.703
see. I see. Okay. So, um, well, during the, during, 
during your trial, you talk about, um, to begin

06:13.491 --> 06:24.987
with, you were, I don't know if the word's 
misrepresented, But the jury wasn't exactly, you

06:25.287 --> 06:29.353
complain about the jury?

06:41.833 --> 06:52.330
Uh-huh.

06:52.350 --> 06:52.510
Uh-huh.

06:57.383 --> 07:23.031
Which

06:57.383 --> 07:23.031
was misquoted in

06:57.383 --> 07:23.031
the Times, correct? Yes. Well, the New York Times 
and other had headlines on it.

07:31.741 --> 07:53.366
You were

07:31.741 --> 07:53.366
charged

07:31.741 --> 07:53.366
with

07:31.741 --> 07:53.366
conspiring

07:31.741 --> 07:53.366
to teach. You were accused for conspiring to 
teach. Yeah. Now, all through the trial, the way in

07:56.330 --> 07:58.512
which you testified, you were conspiring to 
teach. There was no charge against you at that time

07:58.532 --> 07:59.574
at all. I'll show you something more about the 
trial. Mm-hmm.

08:30.481 --> 08:30.621
Mm-hmm. And

08:30.938 --> 08:59.342
then what happened was that the judge said yes. If 
you give them 90 more days, then they'll listen to

08:59.362 --> 09:00.743
the government. Now,

09:01.364 --> 09:23.440
what's interesting

09:01.364 --> 09:23.440
here is that at that point in time, the judge, to say 
that the judge in our trial had not yet been chosen,

09:01.364 --> 09:23.440
I mean, the judge chosen was the very judge that had 
made that very prejudicial remark. Yeah.

09:28.884 --> 09:31.707
Part of us were already found as guilty of trying to 
overthrow the government, let alone trying to do

09:28.884 --> 09:31.707
something. Yeah. And he became, his name was 
Harold Martin, he became the judge in our trial.

09:37.112 --> 09:37.212
Yeah. So obviously, it was tough to get him to 
answer. And also, you said that at one point, that

09:39.414 --> 09:49.103
when you tried to introduce evidence about the 
Communist Party's actual programs, that they

09:39.414 --> 09:49.103
ruled them out? Yeah, they said, well, he even said 
at one point to the judge, Now,

09:52.782 --> 10:10.051
we are not interested in the fact that you may have 
been good boys on other matters. Uh-huh. That you

10:10.231 --> 10:12.295
may have done good things here and there. What 
we're interested in is about this conspiracy

10:12.315 --> 10:13.557
business. Uh-huh. But there was no conspiracy, 
and all you could judge us by is what we were doing.

10:15.841 --> 10:16.822
We were helping to organize the unemployed. We 
were helping... We

10:17.369 --> 10:41.053
were

10:17.369 --> 10:41.053
one of the leading forces in the country that 
helped bring social security into the American

10:17.369 --> 10:41.053
people, that helped to win the right to organize 
the strike. We were very active in the building of

10:41.073 --> 10:42.694
the customer unions and CIOs. We were in the 
forefront of the fight for black freedom, for the

10:42.714 --> 10:44.736
rights of black people. We were against the toll 
tax in the South, or the ex-religious laws, other

10:44.756 --> 10:46.498
things. Uh-huh.

11:04.039 --> 11:10.309
Uh-huh.

11:10.981 --> 11:28.861
It's not that

11:10.981 --> 11:28.861
the worse the

11:10.981 --> 11:28.861
better, that the worst conditions will become the 
sooner that the revolution goes. We believe that

11:28.881 --> 11:36.529
the more you involve people and organize and 
struggle to better their conditions, the better

11:28.881 --> 11:36.529
off you are going to be in order to open up their eyes 
to what the real possibilities were for a

11:28.881 --> 11:36.529
different kind of a new country and a different 
kind of a new world. And therefore, the objective

11:36.549 --> 11:37.410
was to

11:37.745 --> 11:56.268
win as much as you can

11:37.745 --> 11:56.268
for the people because they could not get it unless 
they fought. No one was going to give it to them. If

11:57.309 --> 12:00.753
there were going to be unions, if there could be 
higher wages, if there could be shorter hours, an

11:57.309 --> 12:00.753
eight-hour day, other things they'd have to fight 
for. And as they became confident about their own

12:00.773 --> 12:05.659
strength and what could be accomplished for their 
own unity, they would begin to think ahead to a day

12:00.773 --> 12:05.659
when it would be possible to bring more radical 
change. And

12:06.483 --> 12:12.229
that was the relationship between what we were 
doing at practice and our ultimate goal. And so

12:12.249 --> 12:15.333
they dismissed all of this then, what you were 
actually doing?

12:20.198 --> 12:21.780
Well, we were able to speak some of it in. And so, 
well, so there was...

12:21.800 --> 12:29.888
As far as he was concerned, that had nothing to do 
with what the charge was all about. So how exactly

12:29.908 --> 12:31.410
did they go about attacking you? How did they go 
about attacking you then? They attacked your

12:32.792 --> 12:34.093
ideology? or what they, their interpretation of 
Marxism?

12:47.403 --> 12:58.335
Uh-huh.

12:58.355 --> 12:58.495
Uh-huh. The

12:58.745 --> 13:21.554
Communist Manifesto that

12:58.745 --> 13:21.554
I mentioned before, Karl Marx's Revives, 
Capital, Writings of Lenin, all of those classics

12:58.745 --> 13:21.554
of Marxism. Many of them weren't 100 years old, or 
not going to be 100 years old, or put on trial. And

13:23.316 --> 13:28.142
then they would take out a sentence book here, 
there, out of context, and read it, and try to get a

13:23.316 --> 13:28.142
jury to understand what it was all about. Yeah. 
Uh-huh.

13:55.613 --> 14:16.525
You

13:55.613 --> 14:16.525
wanted to use, as part of your testimony, an 
article you had written in 1938, Notes on the

13:55.613 --> 14:16.525
Defense of American Democracy.

14:16.842 --> 14:42.343
The

14:16.842 --> 14:42.343
only point you have

14:16.842 --> 14:42.343
to do is show its limitations in the capitalism. 
Uh-huh.

15:12.004 --> 15:12.145
Uh-huh. Uh-huh. Uh-huh. So,

15:13.053 --> 15:40.512
had you been able to use certain articles in your 
testimony, do you think it would have You could

15:41.470 --> 16:07.366
have...

15:41.470 --> 16:07.366
No. Uh-huh. To stand up. Yeah. Yeah.

16:25.833 --> 16:26.894
Yeah. Deviant.

16:33.365 --> 16:33.465
Yeah. that

16:34.188 --> 16:57.475
didn't occur in any of the trials. However, in 
1957, it began to change in the country. It didn't

16:58.557 --> 16:59.237
change a certain extent. The party was out of the 
way. Then the Supreme Court, in its composition,

16:59.858 --> 17:04.043
changed with Earl Warren becoming Supreme Court 
Justice against Vincent, who did the Supreme

16:59.858 --> 17:04.043
Court Justice in our trial, our court, by taking 
over the Supreme Court. Uh-huh.

17:24.548 --> 17:25.249
Yeah. Well. Uh-huh. It didn't work. They weren't 
retroactive.

17:33.317 --> 17:33.457
Yeah. Yes. Yes. Well, do you think they asked you 
about your trips abroad to the civil war in Spain

17:35.692 --> 17:43.839
and the USSR also just to make you look worse? Of 
course. In the eyes of the jury, yeah.

17:50.846 --> 17:52.027
Because somehow I was a kind of poor agent. Yeah. 
And it was against the law for you to go to Spain?

17:53.849 --> 17:53.949
Yes. At

17:53.969 --> 18:02.717
that time, or afterwards, there was a so-called 
neutrality act. Uh-huh.

18:20.402 --> 18:23.846
Uh-huh.

18:30.235 --> 18:30.375
Uh-huh. And

18:30.929 --> 18:51.456
I remember,

18:30.929 --> 18:51.456
at that period, they got the Christianity Act, 
which was what did anyone travel to Spain. Yeah. So

18:51.716 --> 18:52.677
that situation, I did go to Spain twice. I see. So 
then, OK, so then you were all, the case ended with

18:52.838 --> 18:56.903
all of you being indicted, correct? And even, is it 
Easterman, your lawyer? Yes,

19:00.212 --> 19:06.785
we have four lawyers. And he was given four months 
in prison for, what was their, what did they use as

19:06.965 --> 19:12.957
an excuse for that? Well, what happened was, when 
the trial was over, the

19:12.977 --> 19:18.688
judge said...

19:23.495 --> 19:42.598
Uh

19:23.495 --> 19:42.598
huh. Yeah.

20:02.324 --> 20:09.795
Yeah.

20:12.919 --> 20:17.285
Yeah.

20:24.516 --> 20:27.420
Yeah.

20:34.927 --> 20:50.022
Yeah.

20:50.062 --> 20:52.885
Well, you were asked or told to jump bail. I mean, 
why? You kind of, you may... Okay. Okay.

21:17.182 --> 21:23.856
Uh-huh.

21:35.801 --> 21:35.942
Uh-huh. Uh-huh.

22:01.057 --> 22:11.607
Uh-huh

22:01.057 --> 22:11.607
Yeah

22:43.008 --> 23:07.930
and

22:43.008 --> 23:07.930
therefore it was impossible to know whether the 
Korean War was going to be two or more wars.

23:07.950 --> 23:09.872
Furthermore, because we didn't know what the FBI 
was going to do, they had one decision to make. In

23:09.892 --> 23:10.753
fact, in my book I have a chapter called Yeah.

23:19.455 --> 23:39.163
Yeah.

23:39.183 --> 23:39.323
Mm-hmm.

23:50.103 --> 24:17.965
Yeah.

24:17.985 --> 24:18.085
Yeah.

24:23.110 --> 24:40.090
Yeah.

25:03.121 --> 25:21.703
didn't you think that was insensitive of them 
knowing that you had a family and

25:03.121 --> 25:21.703
well as i say in the

25:03.121 --> 25:21.703
book

25:32.180 --> 26:00.735
They

25:32.180 --> 26:00.735
say, well, look, I have children and family, 
therefore I shouldn't. Yeah.

26:12.476 --> 26:21.188
And I also say quite

26:12.476 --> 26:21.188
honestly in the book that I wasn't sure whether it 
was because I was more fearful of doing that than

26:12.476 --> 26:21.188
going in and doing my time. Yeah. So yourself, Gus 
Hall, Robert Thompson, and Henry Winston were

26:22.370 --> 26:25.414
asked to go under. Well, when you did go under, your 
wife and your children were harassed. by the FBI,

26:31.478 --> 26:33.200
incredibly, right?

26:38.205 --> 26:39.266
Yes, in fact, I was able to get 20,000 pages of that. 
Of a million possible pages?

26:44.130 --> 26:47.274
Yes, that's what they claimed it was, or something 
like that. Well, did you have any idea how

26:48.054 --> 26:52.178
extensive the FBI and how thorough their 
investigation was at the time? Or was it only in

26:52.278 --> 27:01.047
retrospect in 78 when you got hold of the...

26:52.278 --> 27:01.047
Well, it's only in retrospect, because I always 
knew that they were active.

27:12.569 --> 27:32.245
But

27:12.569 --> 27:32.245
interestingly

27:12.569 --> 27:32.245
enough, everything that they had done, they could 
not know the right way to do it. We eluded them for

27:32.265 --> 27:33.086
more than half a year. Because actually, the only 
way they were able to find it on their own was if they

27:33.106 --> 27:36.152
had a plan for a time to put it on their own. But they 
didn't have anything like that.

27:43.720 --> 28:12.161
Yes.

28:12.181 --> 28:12.582
You wrote... Uh-huh. Yeah. ... Yeah.

28:41.228 --> 28:41.368
Uh-huh. According

28:41.770 --> 28:45.814
to the law, . Yeah, so you stayed with several 
people in basements. You stayed with several

28:50.478 --> 28:52.420
people, couples. Were you in

28:53.381 --> 29:00.128
contact? You were in contact a lot with Henry 
Winston. How about before Leavenworth, were you

29:02.710 --> 29:06.013
in contact with Gus Hall at all? Oh, yes, sure. 
After all, before Leavenworth?

29:10.478 --> 29:10.798
Yes. You mean in the

29:11.065 --> 29:17.935
underground? Yes. In Mexico?

29:22.201 --> 29:24.504
Uh-huh.

29:29.270 --> 29:36.220
Yeah.

29:36.240 --> 29:36.340
Yeah. Yeah.

29:48.781 --> 29:52.887
So you were submitting political articles under 
the name John Swift?

29:59.356 --> 30:00.217
So what did you write? You wrote one article, the 
parasitism of, or parasitism, I'm not sure of the

30:00.257 --> 30:06.186
pronunciation. The parasitism, or the 
parasitism of U.S. economy? Yeah, the

30:10.973 --> 30:17.462
parasitism, sort of war economy. I was taking 
issue with the notion that

30:18.464 --> 30:31.883
Truman had known just at one point that by spending 
the military, we were producing prosperity for

30:18.464 --> 30:31.883
the country, and this was therefore having

30:45.025 --> 30:53.589
Mr.

30:45.025 --> 30:53.589
Green? Can you hold on one more minute? I need to 
turn the tape over. Hold on.
