00:03.322 --> 00:07.627
Sir, how were you treated on your journey? I was 
treated fine. I grew up in a small town in Texas with

00:11.011 --> 00:18.801
about 35,000 people, and everyone was glad to have 
me back. And with being from Texas and in our field

00:18.921 --> 00:29.694
community in Texas, I found the people to be very 
conservative.

00:29.714 --> 00:31.776
They wanted to find out what I was all about. I did 
not

00:33.308 --> 00:44.863
receive a clear weapon opinion. From there,

00:45.885 --> 00:54.776
I went to Camp Finland, so I was on the military 
base, associating with military people. When

00:54.796 --> 00:58.101
you're living on a base and working on a base, 
you're not exposed or you don't have to deal with a

00:54.796 --> 00:58.101
lot of those things. It was anti-military. I just 
didn't have an opportunity to experience any of

00:58.561 --> 00:59.923
those things. Obviously, the papers and the . But 
you're a really nice lady .

01:14.051 --> 01:23.282
Do you think the one-year tour of duty was 
sufficient time to orient a man to the fighting in

01:14.051 --> 01:23.282
Vietnam and then being able to utilize those 
skills? Oh, absolutely. One year may be too long,

01:27.166 --> 01:30.450
by the fact. First of all, you're supposed to have 
your skills

01:30.785 --> 01:38.356
before you go over there. There's also a training. 
You have to train people once they get there.

01:43.925 --> 01:47.651
You've got to hone those skills. I found that as far 
as the wing captains went that had rifle

01:47.671 --> 01:59.188
companies,

01:47.671 --> 01:59.188
they probably, if they survived the first six 
weeks to survive the entire tour, because you come

01:59.793 --> 02:09.286
combat savvy.

02:09.306 --> 02:21.042
I felt that I probably was at the peak of my 
profession

02:09.306 --> 02:21.042
about the third month of combat. And I stayed on 
that crest for a couple of months. About the fifth

02:25.227 --> 02:27.370
or sixth month, I felt that I had peaked out and 
recovered and worked out. It's an awesome

02:33.391 --> 02:39.279
responsibility to help 200, up to 280 people. When 
you're out there by yourself with

02:39.299 --> 02:46.209
no visible means of support. You're in charge of 
everything. You're in charge of the shops by all

02:48.292 --> 02:50.595
the time. I never got a full night's sleep. I had 
them wake me up every hour and give me a situation

02:51.756 --> 02:55.922
report. When you're deprived

02:57.337 --> 03:08.954
of your sleep, you wear it on very quickly. But it 
was absolutely necessary to make sure that that

03:09.174 --> 03:20.350
machine

03:09.174 --> 03:20.350
was up and running 24 hours a day. That was a 
responsibility I couldn't delegate to anyone

03:20.370 --> 03:24.276
else. So it's about a year long now. Depends, 
obviously depends on the job, but as company

03:25.057 --> 03:27.040
commander, I was not

03:27.509 --> 03:45.026
mentally as strong in the sixth month

03:27.509 --> 03:45.026
as I was in the fourth month. As far as the brain 
goes, again, it depends on each guy. The guy that

03:49.810 --> 03:57.077
leads the hunt, or patrols, or combat moves, 
literally tunes out, in my view. That's the way he

03:58.188 --> 04:02.916
avoids middle strength.

04:03.577 --> 04:05.020
He disengages his brain. He's functioning. His 
senses are alert to what's going on around him. He

04:10.770 --> 04:18.804
tries not to think about, if I go around this tree or 
come around this rock, that when I cross that

04:10.770 --> 04:18.804
river, I'm going to get shot. He just can't think 
like that. So I believe that they mentally came

04:21.391 --> 04:25.035
down to it. They weren't in a trance, but mentally, 
they're out of purity. And that's the way they

04:29.099 --> 04:30.360
survived. Thirteen months is a long time to be over 
there, knowing that at any time, the enemy could

04:32.782 --> 04:40.349
engage you. You had to do something to prepare 
yourself for that. You stated that after an

04:44.313 --> 04:48.057
individual made six weeks here, they had a pretty 
good chance of making it out of the country. What

04:53.759 --> 04:54.980
about the short timers? How was their attitude and 
how did they react in the field? The short timers

05:01.148 --> 05:05.813
were very concerned.

05:05.833 --> 05:13.082
The last six weeks, for most of them, I think, they 
just feared that something would happen. When you

05:14.604 --> 05:17.267
reach the midpoint of 13 months, it was called, 
over the month, you're on the downhill side. Until

05:26.476 --> 05:31.764
then, you really don't think about it

05:26.476 --> 05:31.764
anymore. But, as you get closer to finishing up 
your tour in combat, you start thinking about, am I

05:31.784 --> 05:42.199
going to make it? Are we going to, what's going to 
happen to me the next time we get into a fight? I

05:48.247 --> 05:55.819
would say the last six weeks, the last two weeks

05:48.247 --> 05:55.819
in particular. In your opinion, sir, what were the 
major causes for losing the war? Lack of support

06:01.689 --> 06:05.215
from the United States. There were many things 
that contributed to that. The protesters, the

06:07.859 --> 06:14.710
press that gave a lot of support to that, made it 
miserable for everyone. Because

06:15.938 --> 06:34.195
of the lack of support, I think the politicians

06:15.938 --> 06:34.195
fought the war and let it off. Militarily, we won 
the war, and we could have won the war, but the

06:34.215 --> 06:45.085
political decisions,

06:34.215 --> 06:45.085
labor, the battle was fought politically. Would 
it possibly influence the outcome of the war in

06:45.487 --> 06:49.551
favor of the United States? Anything, let's say, 
within the South Vietnamese government?

07:03.927 --> 07:11.835
The South Vietnamese government has

07:03.927 --> 07:11.835
not been corrupt. They may have had more support by 
the Vietnamese. They've

07:15.811 --> 07:38.893
been able to take care of their own country. That 
was not the situation. To me, it looked like a time

07:39.473 --> 07:41.235
bomb waiting for its throat, even when I was there 
in 1969. Those people had been in the war for many

07:41.255 --> 07:43.117
years before the Americans went over there in 
1965. It was business as usual. They walked in here

07:43.657 --> 07:44.518
and made a common deal. They identified

07:45.275 --> 07:51.684
that they had strong family ties. They had seen the 
governments come and go. They were all corrupt.

08:00.716 --> 08:01.577
They were taxed heavily. And I think

08:01.597 --> 08:11.131
there was

08:01.597 --> 08:11.131
very little support from the government. The war 
was a way of life for them. It was a matter of time

08:11.872 --> 08:13.013
until they settled in. Are there any further 
comments you would like to make, sir? No, I don't

08:14.455 --> 08:15.096
think so, Mary.
