WEBVTT

00:04.385 --> 00:27.527
and

00:04.385 --> 00:27.527
the death of John Holdup. You could, you know, 
they'd take their dead off of the camp. And maybe a

00:28.768 --> 00:29.809
lot of wounded died on the ground later. And they 
were killed a week after. How

00:31.958 --> 00:59.966
do you feel about the law? I don't know. I've read a 
lot about it. I

01:01.709 --> 01:21.936
almost went a couple years ago. And I'd like to see 
it one more time. I'd like to look at it. As far as the

01:23.198 --> 01:24.780
weight anymore, I don't think I would be too 
emotional to see it. I

01:26.684 --> 01:50.687
think it was long overdue that y'all were 
neglected in the country, recognizing what y'all

01:26.684 --> 01:50.687
did, because it was so different when y'all came 
back than when the World War II, World War II people

01:26.684 --> 01:50.687
came back. Well, if you want to read, I mean, yeah, I 
was elected in the World War II, so to come, but

01:50.707 --> 01:53.069
you've got Corey in there. Does anybody know about 
that? What

01:55.017 --> 02:06.033
do they feel like before they enter? I feel like the 
country just tried to overlook. They've tried to

02:07.016 --> 02:08.200
push Vietnam and not talk about it because Because

02:09.125 --> 02:25.825
we won, in other words. And it's like Vietnam, we 
didn't win. And so they try to push it off. Oh, yeah.

02:27.447 --> 02:28.669
I think they definitely tried to sweep that under 
the carpet. So, yeah. So they don't want to

02:28.889 --> 02:30.291
recognize anyone or recognize anything about it. 
They just want to forget about it in the street.

02:31.292 --> 02:32.173
But, yeah, the vet's not letting them do it. It's 
pretty strong. It doesn't push the figure. So they

02:33.154 --> 02:33.715
didn't turn it over. in

02:35.483 --> 02:55.575
the meetings here in the United States now, that's 
a pretty good group. You can get just 1% of them

02:55.595 --> 02:56.277
hired. They can be hired. And those vets today are 
old enough now where they're in to come on in to

02:56.677 --> 02:58.821
politics, politics, and senators. People in 
Kansas have to learn to be heard.

03:02.602 --> 03:23.508
Yeah,

03:02.602 --> 03:23.508
if somebody hadn't have ever pushed it, it would 
have been one of the quietest wheels that took

03:02.602 --> 03:23.508
flight. Yeah, I think the raw, I guess it's nice, 
I'm sure they deserve it. We described it as one of

03:24.889 --> 03:25.690
the main ones. I think the one we have here goes 
next. I think anybody that... Is

03:27.391 --> 03:43.138
there a lot of drugs over there, when you were over 
there? I

03:44.671 --> 04:08.231
mean, were they readily available? Hard stuff 
that's like opium that has some, you know, you

04:08.252 --> 04:10.013
could get just about anything. Yeah. Marijuana. 
The opium has just about anywhere you want.

04:11.254 --> 04:11.454
Marijuana. It's big, and I get the hard stuff about 
it. I don't know anybody that's been through the

04:12.375 --> 04:13.696
hard stuff before me. I don't know anybody. 
Marijuana. Marijuana. I

04:15.620 --> 04:42.336
would say probably marijuana. I

04:43.801 --> 04:56.435
would be afraid to say what percentage, but just my 
opinion, probably 90%. That's what happened. Do

04:56.896 --> 04:59.062
you think some of it's harder drugs, because some 
of the people had a lot of trouble when they came

04:56.896 --> 04:59.062
back? Probably. I mean, do you think it's the 
individual that just couldn't cope, that if

05:00.322 --> 05:21.822
they'd have been here and something would have 
happened to them here, then they could, you know,

05:00.322 --> 05:21.822
the circumstances over there were so much more 
magnified, but still, that if something would

05:00.322 --> 05:21.822
have happened to them here, it could have. They'd 
have had a traumatic experience here. Right. They

05:22.923 --> 05:23.423
did it the same way. It's the type of person that 
went so much that they sent you over unprepared and

05:23.443 --> 05:28.428
everything, and that was why. And... I'm

05:30.376 --> 05:52.312
sure there was a lot of boys that probably saw a lot 
more bluer stuff than I did. I've seen enough of it.

05:52.813 --> 05:54.215
I'm sure that there was a lot more when I didn't see 
many bluer stuff. Anybody that was in the field

05:54.235 --> 05:55.337
didn't have to be scared. I

05:57.089 --> 06:18.462
don't know how I could have made it. As a matter of 
fact, I was in the office when I was over there. I

06:19.764 --> 06:20.846
told myself I don't think I could ever go with them. 
Then again, I didn't know whether I could take on

06:20.866 --> 06:22.368
life even if I was there. One way or the other, I 
would have had to leave. So

06:24.089 --> 06:48.267
they prepared you for that, the Army did? Yes. 
That's not the same... Oh, yeah, that... That's

06:48.387 --> 06:50.791
not the same thing, and this could happen to you no 
matter what, though. I don't know what I read. I

06:52.388 --> 07:16.436
don't know whether I could just keep giving my 
name, right? I don't know. I don't know. I'm just

07:17.017 --> 07:17.417
glad I did. I think the public today is illiterate, 
almost, towards the subject. They don't really

07:31.280 --> 07:33.082
know. I mean, you ask people about Vietnam. I mean, 
back then, a lot of people didn't even know what

07:34.965 --> 07:38.630
side we were fighting for, who we were fighting 
for, why. And today, it seems like in history

07:38.970 --> 07:41.674
classes, you just kind of touch upon it. You say, 
OK, Vietnam happened, da, da, da. And you don't

07:42.635 --> 07:43.276
really go into it. You think that the public needs 
to be more educated about what happened. that as

07:45.511 --> 07:57.048
overall

07:45.511 --> 07:57.048
that

07:45.511 --> 07:57.048
they're, you know, they don't really know. Still, 
a lot of people, you ask about Vietnam, and they're

07:57.068 --> 07:59.652
like, well, it's a world we fought. They don't 
really know whose side we're on or any of the

07:59.672 --> 08:01.355
principles behind it. Were you born? I was born in 
65. In 65, so it was a few years. As a matter of fact,

08:04.660 --> 08:06.743
basically, what you really... I

08:06.723 --> 08:29.054
mean, I remember

08:06.723 --> 08:29.054
when I was

08:06.723 --> 08:29.054
little seeing bits of it on the news, you know. 
Yeah, that's when it was over. But, you know, we

08:29.695 --> 08:30.396
never watched it. I mean, I didn't know what was 
going on at the time. It seems like a lot of people my

08:31.477 --> 08:32.458
age, they don't. I mean, it happened during our 
lifetime, but they don't know anything about it.

08:34.081 --> 08:34.181
Yeah. Yeah, I've seen that transition of the age. 
When I got back, you know, everybody They

08:37.334 --> 09:01.415
were driving cars here back then. Today, some 17 or 
18-year-old person passed me by. And I kind of take

09:02.456 --> 09:04.157
for granted a bunch of notes, and then it all of a 
sudden gets me. It may not even have been born, but

09:04.177 --> 09:05.498
it was born right at the time. So it's kind of like 
being in World War II. It seems like they teach you

09:07.473 --> 09:13.003
that, I mean, in history. You learn the causes, the 
who fought for who. You learn all these things

09:16.309 --> 09:19.895
about World War I and World War II. And like Korea, 
too. You get to Korea and you get to Vietnam in the

09:20.336 --> 09:22.099
history class. And if you even get that far, it's 
just touch and go. Yeah. No, yeah. As...

09:31.115 --> 09:51.668
controversial

09:31.115 --> 09:51.668
as the war was, I think that it should be in the 
history. It should be taught. We're bound to learn

09:52.109 --> 09:52.730
something. What to do next time, what not to do. 
It's like, you know, in Washington, the political

09:53.511 --> 09:54.653
agenda. If we do this again, let's do it right. 
Let's don't do it at all. It's

09:56.933 --> 10:13.518
like the stereotypes just overwhelm everyone. 
It's like everybody came back, can't handle life

10:13.538 --> 10:14.600
now. They can't deal with it. That's the kind of 
people you hear about. You don't hear about the

10:15.962 --> 10:18.847
people who went out there, they did their job, and 
what they were doing was right, and they came back

10:15.962 --> 10:18.847
and they're okay. It's like you hear about the bad. 
Yeah. Yeah. I

10:20.474 --> 10:45.763
can't imagine anybody else, you know, in the 
world, you know, because I know that Kelly is, you

10:20.474 --> 10:45.763
know, the, William Kelly, the little white guy in 
the building. I don't know him. I've seen a lot of

10:46.143 --> 10:46.984
children dead, wounded. They were caught in the 
middle of a firefight in the village. I don't think

10:48.246 --> 10:49.367
anybody can lift them, level down on them. But

10:49.617 --> 11:10.884
you also got to consider that you put up 
13-year-old kids tonight. They were innovative

11:10.904 --> 11:12.426
when it comes to hand-to-hand, your life or their 
life. You know, you make a choice. That's my

11:13.026 --> 11:13.367
nature. As much as I like kids, I like myself, too. I 
couldn't let any bad kid make me a bad kid. and

11:17.900 --> 11:38.272
you don't have time to talk about it, I don't do it. 
It's not as serious where you just have to make a

11:38.292 --> 11:40.155
judgment as to what you want to do with it. But, 
yeah, the stereotyping that we have, I don't know,

11:40.175 --> 11:42.118
I think a lot of the newspapers get that.

11:47.937 --> 12:14.957
We

11:47.937 --> 12:14.957
had the middle class, lower class, very

12:15.578 --> 12:36.545
few upper class white boys. You had a lot of blacks. 
A lot of those blacks then were mainly all lower

12:37.065 --> 12:38.167
class. That's about everyone that I was going to 
have to admit. uh,

12:40.452 --> 13:02.839
came from the ghetto, uh, with a couple of my good 
friends. They lived in Vietnam or South Carolina,

13:02.859 --> 13:04.380
just way back in the spring season. I don't think 
we'd ever seen, uh, the city until they were

13:04.400 --> 13:06.323
drafted, and that's where I had them. Uh, in the 
mountains of Kentucky, they just, they lived like

13:06.343 --> 13:07.825
snuggish men. Uh, they're just, uh, And

13:09.494 --> 13:27.118
I made, you know, it was a tight group. Like I said, 
they had, you know, the middle class on the back.

13:28.400 --> 13:30.523
There was a majority of the good guys, but there was 
some rough guys back there, you know, called

13:28.400 --> 13:30.523
outlaws. As

13:30.993 --> 13:53.541
I was driving home after the interview, I recorded 
some additional information and some comments

13:30.993 --> 13:53.541
that follow.

13:58.145 --> 14:13.723
At the end of the interview, Craig and I continued 
talking, because he took me and showed me all of his

13:58.145 --> 14:13.723
medals, and he showed me a bunch of stuff that he 
had, his pictures and newspaper clippings, and he

13:58.145 --> 14:13.723
told me about that... His buddies, they were very 
much like a fraternity. Still today, they could

14:18.295 --> 14:22.700
call him up, and he'd do anything in the world for 
them. But there's just a bond that's developed,

14:23.181 --> 14:28.027
and that he's not ashamed of anything that he did 
while he was over there. That what he did is what he

14:28.047 --> 14:32.212
had to do, and he doesn't regret or look back upon 
it. And that he can't say that he wouldn't do it all

14:32.933 --> 14:39.762
over again, because he thinks he would. My overall 
impression of this interview was really great. I

14:46.316 --> 14:54.265
was worried when I got there that Mr. Champion 
wouldn't say a whole lot because he comes across as

14:46.316 --> 14:54.265
kind of a shy individual.

14:56.889 --> 15:00.092
But as you can tell, once he started opening up, he 
just told me about everything. And as I was

15:00.152 --> 15:03.997
leaving, he was talking. He had gone to A&M for two 
and a half years. And he said that that the people,

15:11.062 --> 15:28.165
the guys in the Corps were really, once they found 
out you had come back from Vietnam, they really

15:11.062 --> 15:28.165
tried to get to know you and they really tried, you 
know, they really wanted to know what it was like

15:11.062 --> 15:28.165
since most of them were just about on their way 
there. And they really wanted to talk to you about

15:28.205 --> 15:36.956
it and they really, you know, that's all they 
needed to know and they were really after, you

15:28.205 --> 15:36.956
know, wanting information. But He said he told me 
about one of the corps commanders that he met, and

15:39.884 --> 15:46.857
his last name was Huff. And he said this boy 
graduated from school and had just about

15:47.257 --> 15:54.370
everything going for him, and he went to Vietnam. 
And right before he was to come home, he was shot

15:55.332 --> 16:01.724
down in his jet and killed. And he said, you know, 
It's the people like that that he he thinks about

16:05.770 --> 16:19.932
that he he still he wonders about a lot of people 
because he says that this boy had everything going

16:05.770 --> 16:19.932
for him and what if why did it go on so long that if 
they could have fought it like they would have how

16:21.481 --> 16:45.902
many lives could have been saved because they 
wouldn't still have been there and he looks upon

16:21.481 --> 16:45.902
that and he does he blames the people in washington 
i mean that's who was at fault to him

16:21.481 --> 16:45.902
and he says that the people that were the people 
that he'll be, like when he's watching a marathon

16:46.338 --> 16:53.344
and maybe there's someone in a wheelchair, he 
wonders about these kind of people, a young boy

16:54.640 --> 17:00.326
who's a good-looking kid who had everything going 
for him. And he wonders when. Was it at the

17:03.289 --> 17:08.455
beginning that he lost, that his accident 
happened, that he lost his legs? Or was it at the

17:08.475 --> 17:09.396
end? And he said he wonders about how many of the 
casualties and how many of the wounded could have

17:10.177 --> 17:18.666
been avoided if the war would have been ended 
sooner. But he also said that out of all his

17:20.368 --> 17:23.972
buddies, You know, they were, he said, you know, 
it's been 20 years now, he said, since he was in NOM.

17:32.533 --> 17:41.842
He says he still remembers it, and he still often 
wonders about his buddies that are, you know, that

17:32.533 --> 17:41.842
they were close, and a lot of them didn't make it 
back. He said, but he still feels like he could call

17:41.882 --> 17:51.732
up on the phone someone, one of his buddies, and if 
he needed something, that they'd do it for him,

17:41.882 --> 17:51.732
because you develop such a tight bond. and he had 
blacks, there was black and white, and you

17:51.712 --> 17:59.561
depended on those people to live. And he told me 
that he really, he hoped I got an A on my paper and

17:59.581 --> 18:05.287
then it was, you know, that I did good. And I told him 
that it really didn't matter what I made on this

18:05.307 --> 18:16.820
paper because the information that I gained just 
from talking to him helped me immensely. I mean,

18:17.441 --> 18:21.465
it's helped me enough to help understand and know 
more about this war.
