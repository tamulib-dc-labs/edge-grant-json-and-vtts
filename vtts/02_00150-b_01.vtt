WEBVTT

00:03.524 --> 00:09.130
You were talking about the areas of emphasis, I 
believe. And this was reflected in, as you would

00:09.851 --> 00:21.724
imagine, in large measure by the people who were 
here and those we recruited early on. Silver

00:21.824 --> 00:27.771
culture was certainly something that we 
emphasized. We had strengths in soils. And this is

00:32.313 --> 00:53.882
another example of why you can build strong 
programs at Texas A&M because not only did we have

00:32.313 --> 00:53.882
strength in soils, but we also could draw on the 
soil and crop sciences department for strength

00:32.313 --> 00:53.882
over there as well. You could say the same thing 
about economics and so on, because forestry, like

00:54.419 --> 01:06.117
most of those kind of fields, are made up of a group 
of disciplines. And so you hear faculty come to you

01:08.500 --> 01:23.683
trained in the discipline with an application to 
forestry.

01:26.077 --> 01:37.016
Silver culture soils, our investment in wood 
technology

01:26.077 --> 01:37.016
was in wood chemistry.

01:39.560 --> 01:50.278
If you go toward solid wood research and this sort 
of thing, it gets to be terribly expensive. So we

01:50.731 --> 02:00.600
hired a wood chemist, Dr. Goldstein, to lead that 
effort. And he did extremely well.

02:07.826 --> 02:20.637
And again, related to other chemists on the campus 
who had a common interest in cellulose chemistry.

02:21.865 --> 02:33.478
It took a while for, except for the people that were 
already established, it took a while for us to

02:21.865 --> 02:33.478
develop areas of emphasis.

02:37.462 --> 02:51.417
The evolution of a new department and new faculty 
is such that they spend their early years getting

02:37.462 --> 02:51.417
their teaching programs established because 
those students show up every day. And

02:51.903 --> 03:03.076
this slows down the process in research a bit. But 
ultimately, they come

03:03.096 --> 03:16.051
on and get a research program started and go on from 
there. What were some of the first signals to you as

03:16.071 --> 03:19.395
their leader that you were having some success? 
Well,

03:19.814 --> 03:41.478
I guess the first one was we applied for and gained 
accreditation

03:19.814 --> 03:41.478
for our program by the Society of American 
Foresters in the minimum time required, which was

03:19.814 --> 03:41.478
five years.

03:44.642 --> 03:47.425
The society has been accrediting forestry 
education program since 1935 and has a

03:48.147 --> 04:03.094
long-standing relationship with helping with 
this national accrediting organization.

04:09.626 --> 04:12.130
Anyway, it's a member of that. A lot of academic 
programs have attempted to get into the

04:12.785 --> 04:34.631
accreditation business, and they lack standards 
and everything that goes with the accreditation

04:12.785 --> 04:34.631
process. But SAF has been in the business a long 
time, so we felt that was our first major In

04:41.185 --> 05:02.721
this part of the world, then Stephen F. Austin, 
LSU, Arkansas Monticello,

04:41.185 --> 05:02.721
Oklahoma State, then Mississippi State, 
Tennessee.

05:04.996 --> 05:09.301
Auburn, Georgia, Florida, North Carolina State, 
DPI. Do you have any idea how many nationally?

05:14.268 --> 05:14.969
45, 50? Yeah.

05:18.713 --> 05:25.982
And I presume as the years have gone on, there 
haven't been any particular problems of

05:18.713 --> 05:25.982
retaining that presentation. No, there have not. 
And as you can imagine, there's a continuing

05:28.786 --> 05:34.513
debate within the... Society of American 
Foragers about what accreditation ought to be.

05:40.632 --> 05:44.115
And everybody seems to have a different opinion 
about that. But no, we've not had any trouble with

05:44.695 --> 05:48.619
that. What about some important early faculty 
accomplishments, recognitions, grants, et

05:48.639 --> 06:02.871
cetera? Winning national awards.

06:07.923 --> 06:23.926
Well, I don't know how much claim we can make here 
because some of the more senior faculty that we

06:07.923 --> 06:23.926
recruited had already, Goldstein, again, as an 
example, has already established himself. And of

06:25.008 --> 06:31.958
course, we are like the bird hunter. We claim all 
the birds that fall, but Irv got some good national

06:37.910 --> 06:41.796
awards in the 70s, I guess. Dave Boring, of course, 
who was here when we started, received awards in

06:43.798 --> 06:53.853
soils. I'm drawing a blank on anybody else right 
now. In seeking... off-campus funding, where

07:06.226 --> 07:16.008
does the person in forest return primarily for 
submission

07:06.226 --> 07:16.008
? Well, in that period of time, you primarily went 
to industry for your off-campus funding,

07:21.312 --> 07:48.653
although there were some, well, the U.S. Forest 
Service had funding through its research arm that

07:21.312 --> 07:48.653
you could gain access to, and we were successful 
there in some cases.

07:50.354 --> 07:55.319
but primarily industry and the federal system. 
And, of course, then you always try to get the

07:55.820 --> 08:12.618
director of the experiment station to include 
something in his legislative budget request that

07:55.820 --> 08:12.618
would be helpful

07:55.820 --> 08:12.618
to you. Which industries, looking back over this 
30 years, Which industries have been supportive

08:16.730 --> 08:22.138
that you would like to mention? Well, Temple, 
which is now Temple Inland, but I've gone through a

08:22.158 --> 08:36.780
series of different kind of ownerships.

08:38.414 --> 08:48.555
continues today to be supportive, and it's, as you 
know, has family ties to East Texas. They've been

08:48.575 --> 08:54.607
also very supportive of Stephen F. Austin, too. 
Arthur tends to be fairly provincial in his view.

09:00.588 --> 09:09.401
and wants to make sure his money stays in East Texas 
and doesn't cross the Trinity River. But the

09:10.103 --> 09:13.948
company itself has been very supportive. Kirby, 
which is now Louisiana Pacific, was helpful to us

09:13.968 --> 09:23.323
in the early going. Owens, Illinois,

09:23.904 --> 09:28.030
which is now Champion

09:30.575 --> 09:56.953
International,

09:30.575 --> 09:56.953
St. Regis, Southland Paper Company,

09:30.575 --> 09:56.953
Melvin

09:30.575 --> 09:56.953
Kirk, Kirk family, and they helped us in different 
ways. We largely approached the earth planning.

10:00.695 --> 10:22.782
In fact, we still have a Southwest

10:00.695 --> 10:22.782
scholarship

10:00.695 --> 10:22.782
that started way back in the primary in the current 
planning. In terms of students, about what was the

10:22.802 --> 10:25.105
enrollment of people planning for as far as their 
careers in the . Oh.

10:29.266 --> 10:33.472
I'd say maybe 20. What we did was,

10:33.552 --> 10:50.177
of course, when the word got out that we were going 
to have a forestry department offer a U.S. degree,

10:33.552 --> 10:50.177
then those people who were coming here for the 
two-year program you

10:50.427 --> 11:14.996
know, shifted

10:50.427 --> 11:14.996
gears and stayed with us. But my guess is the first 
bunch amounted to about 20 or something like that.

11:16.557 --> 11:18.880
By the time when the program is fully approved, do 
you remember what the enrollment might have been

11:16.557 --> 11:18.880
about that time? Oh, by the coordinating board. 
Probably not much

11:20.633 --> 11:31.929
more. Were there any important landmarks such as 
when the first forestry undergraduate degree was

11:31.949 --> 11:35.294
granted? Yeah. Of course, that was

11:35.434 --> 11:43.806
granted in one of our two-year

11:44.579 --> 12:09.489
people

11:44.579 --> 12:09.489
who were here in this state. And so I think the first 
actual degree we granted was in 1971. Yeah, 1971,

12:10.770 --> 12:11.832
because the department was started in 69. So I 
think in two years, we'll be getting our first

12:11.852 --> 12:13.033
degree. And we also had a cadre of graduate 
students that had been here.

12:24.214 --> 12:32.686
One who used to be on our faculty, got his PhD here 
very early on. And so I guess probably

12:38.056 --> 13:02.752
we had 10

12:38.056 --> 13:02.752
or

12:38.056 --> 13:02.752
15 graduate students when we got started. But they 
had come, one, either to work on the PhD, but we had

13:02.772 --> 13:04.995
already been granted that authority, or started . 
Do you remember when the first PhD was granted? No,

13:05.977 --> 13:06.217
I don't. It was after you arrived, though? Well,

13:07.334 --> 13:32.818
as you can imagine, we get quite a number out of East 
Texas. As the years have passed,

13:33.372 --> 13:46.548
they come more out of the urban

13:33.372 --> 13:46.548
centers. And it's not unusual to get them out of 
West Texas, Fort Stockton

13:46.568 --> 13:54.597
or someplace like that. But right now, the urban 
areas

14:05.435 --> 14:08.640
And very good students. By the time you got here, 
women had already been admitted to the

14:08.660 --> 14:13.227
university. Were the women in the forestry 
program early? Not early.

14:21.621 --> 14:24.005
Not early. Although, with time, we've had a good 
number students,

14:32.772 --> 14:48.267
both

14:32.772 --> 14:48.267
graduate students and undergraduates. I

14:48.287 --> 14:57.336
was talking to one the other day who's the new head 
of the department at Clemson University. A

14:57.356 --> 14:57.717
graduate of A&M? Yes. What's her name? Pat. You'll 
remember when you were raised by Howard. That's

15:02.017 --> 15:10.790
always an interesting process on this campus.

15:13.133 --> 15:17.339
We were, of course, came out of the Range Science 
Department. And so, Harry Kirkall had worked out

15:17.399 --> 15:24.970
an arrangement for us move from the second floor to 
the third floor in what's now the Peterson

15:25.962 --> 15:43.232
Building, which was Plant Sciences then, and 
occupy some space along the horticulture, and

15:25.962 --> 15:43.232
maybe retain a little space in Range Science. I'm 
not exactly sure how that worked, but we got our

15:44.014 --> 15:48.662
offices away from the brain science department 
and onto the third floor of Peterson. And they were

15:55.751 --> 15:57.674
quite modest, I might add. But we did keep the labs 
that we had down

15:58.495 --> 16:06.865
in the building. And very soon, We got enough money 
put together to build what's called a forest

16:11.221 --> 16:26.323
science lab out on Agronomy Road now, right next to 
purchasing and stores. Then go forward

16:26.343 --> 16:31.630
chronologically. Where did you move to after this 
first year? We thought we had died and gone to

16:37.038 --> 16:40.603
heaven. when the recreation and parks department 
moved out of the old horse barn.

16:52.046 --> 16:56.310
And we were given that building. And we thought 
that was absolutely wonderful. That was about

17:02.015 --> 17:03.516
1972.

17:06.719 --> 17:09.882
And so it did give us adequate office, 
administrative

17:10.908 --> 17:18.836
space, some teaching space. But we still, for that 
time, we had the forest science lab out on the west

17:18.856 --> 17:26.363
campus. So we had four big research

17:26.383 --> 17:35.752
labs out there and some office space. So we were 
pretty good here based on the number of people we

17:35.772 --> 17:37.073
had. Of course, a lot of the research then and now to 
some degree is conducted in East Texas field

17:41.992 --> 17:47.839
research. What locations? Well, mostly on 
industry land.

17:56.370 --> 18:10.328
We had research located on companies that I named a 
while ago, work out an arrangement with them to set

17:56.370 --> 18:10.328
aside particular areas that had the kind of forest 
and they

18:10.527 --> 18:40.146
were very in fact I just sat in on a meeting day 
before yesterday that will involve seven

18:10.527 --> 18:40.146
companies not just in Texas but in Louisiana and 
Arkansas

18:10.527 --> 18:40.146
that will involve that sort of thing and they will 
commit resources and people Now,

18:40.902 --> 19:00.396
most of this of the apartments for service, most of 
it is on the growing of the tree, or is it on the

18:40.902 --> 19:00.396
processing and the chemistry of the tree that is 
already there? Most of it is on what we would call

19:00.882 --> 19:11.921
forest production, the growing and culture of 
forest stands. Although we have had, I mentioned

19:11.941 --> 19:17.510
Goldstein. Later on, we hired a guy by the name of 
Joe Massey, who was an operations research guy. He

19:25.773 --> 19:48.159
did an awful lot of work in temple's mills on how 
they ought to position

19:25.773 --> 19:48.159
their making their plywood and that sort of thing 
and optimizing their mill operations. And so Joe

19:48.179 --> 19:53.265
was here, gosh, 20 years or so and made a very 
significant impact with his research. So that

19:57.902 --> 20:18.102
most of it has

19:57.902 --> 20:18.102
to do

19:57.902 --> 20:18.102
with the pine trees. Yes. And the processing of the 
trees. And some of the cabin maker, as a little kid,

20:18.883 --> 20:22.527
remember, he was doing a lot of work with the 
cyclists, which almost no longer is processed in

20:18.883 --> 20:22.527
the country, but they do it all the time. No,

20:22.912 --> 20:40.827
most of the hardwood that's cut today will go into 
pulp and paper. That's a desired They have desired

20:45.068 --> 20:51.339
characteristics for that fine paper business.

20:52.821 --> 20:58.772
Except for the river bottoms in Texas, the quality 
of the hardwoods is not very good. Not like you run

20:58.792 --> 21:05.503
into over in the Carolinas and North Georgia and 
that part of the world. Let's jump back to your new

21:07.066 --> 21:10.452
service department head, Henry. Well,

21:11.275 --> 21:33.975
you know, happily, most of it were joys.

21:34.951 --> 21:47.268
Obviously, the typical frustrations come along 
on personnel issues and this sort of thing,

21:34.951 --> 21:47.268
funding, this sort of thing. But generally, I got 
good support from the college dean's office.

21:56.060 --> 22:00.086
Harry was a good dean. Well, Harry had a... First of 
all, Harry was a scientist, so he understood where

22:05.917 --> 22:19.132
science fit in the overall scheme of things in an 
academic setting. But secondly, he also knew what

22:19.812 --> 22:28.141
it took to make a department successful. And he was 
accessible, easy to talk to, And

22:34.688 --> 22:44.939
I found him

22:34.688 --> 22:44.939
to be a very good boss. And then I ran into you in that 
period of time, because somewhere along in there,

22:45.860 --> 23:03.480
when you became dean of faculties, we used to have 
to bring every faculty candidate that we were

23:04.068 --> 23:10.598
interviewing to your office.

23:12.060 --> 23:26.160
And I have, later on, I filched a lot of your 
techniques that I saw you use during that

23:12.060 --> 23:26.160
interview process. Because one of the things that 
you did was share with those faculty members or

23:26.180 --> 23:32.910
those candidates a lot

23:33.245 --> 24:01.513
of It's

24:03.012 --> 24:22.949
something that changes paths. We are 
conservative students. We're changing, but we

24:23.570 --> 24:25.472
don't change the fact that we kind of follow the 
tradition of the world. And I remember one fellow

24:25.492 --> 24:27.513
who was from Berkeley who looked like a smelly one, 
but he acted like it. And he came back the next day

24:27.533 --> 24:28.534
and thanked me. And he said, I don't really like it 
here very much. And I said, no, you all wouldn't

24:30.916 --> 24:31.737
like me. Well,

24:32.678 --> 24:52.141
his role

24:32.678 --> 24:52.141
was most pronounced when we were starting.

24:53.803 --> 24:58.669
I mean, every time that we had a critical moved to 
make, you know, he was there, he was supportive,

24:59.071 --> 25:10.515
and offered good advice about how to do things and 
that sort of thing. And then early on when we

25:11.018 --> 25:17.525
started, he helped sweep the money together to get 
that building out there. And so we'd have a place to

25:18.366 --> 25:25.894
do some research and that sort of thing. So I'd say 
his impact was greatest in the early years of my

25:25.914 --> 25:36.925
tenure as department head. I found him to be just 
super, and then later when I moved over to the

25:36.905 --> 25:54.137
experiment station and started having a 
different kind of relationship with him, I tended

25:36.905 --> 25:54.137
to appreciate him even more. because,

25:54.826 --> 26:18.040
you know, we'd have the usual problems with 
personnel and funding and that sort of thing that

25:54.826 --> 26:18.040
we had to work out. And he was just always a super guy 
to try to work with. You were supported originally

26:19.181 --> 26:20.243
to have them to couple. Patterson was gone by the 
time I actually moved here. So you started out

26:24.664 --> 26:32.335
reporting to Harry, and the whole eight years he 
was redeemed? Right. Did you also report either to

26:34.738 --> 26:40.968
the Experiment Station or Extension Service? 
Well, yes, certainly the Experiment Station.

26:45.675 --> 26:49.420
Jarvis Miller was involved there. toward the 
latter part of that period of time. He was

26:55.472 --> 27:00.300
associate director for a while and then he became 
director. John Hutchison was director of

27:00.660 --> 27:04.486
extension. Yeah, you could say I reported to him, 
but we had, as every department head did, except

27:06.029 --> 27:14.682
for maybe a few like Ty Timm, had a very different 
relationship than we had with Jarvis or Harry.

27:25.145 --> 27:34.320
John was a very dominant personality and there 
wasn't much give or take there. And we didn't have

27:35.141 --> 27:42.492
the budgetary and administrative relationship 
with Extension at that time that they do now. In

27:42.708 --> 27:58.171
general percentages, about what percentage

27:42.708 --> 27:58.171
of the department's budget during those years 
came from the academic, what percentage from the

27:42.708 --> 27:58.171
experiment station, what percentage from the 
extension service? I'd say probably 60% in the

27:58.191 --> 28:06.083
early years was from the academic side. 30% from 
Experiment Station and 10% from Extension. We

28:12.182 --> 28:15.166
didn't have but one Extension specialist. Did 
that change by the end of your eight years? Yes. How

28:19.931 --> 28:20.972
so? The Experiment Station became a bigger 
player. Extension never really changed during my

28:25.617 --> 28:34.026
tenure there. All that came later. but we began to 
bring in more researchers. Did you, as you had your

28:42.386 --> 28:52.034
own personal set of goals for the department, did 
you win, did you achieve every goal, or were there

28:42.386 --> 28:52.034
some where you were frustrated? Well, your 
ambitions are always fairly substantially

28:52.875 --> 29:06.107
beyond your ability to accomplish, but I'd say We 
set out as our first goal to become accredited, and

29:07.302 --> 29:23.638
we achieved that in a timely way.

29:24.139 --> 29:29.825
I think probably I had two disappointments. Our 
enrollment did not grow as fast as I thought it

29:30.005 --> 29:34.069
should. And I thought our

29:34.589 --> 29:58.003
research

29:34.589 --> 29:58.003
program

29:34.589 --> 29:58.003
would probably go faster and larger than it did. 
But other than that, I think the eight years I spent

29:58.023 --> 29:59.685
were quite rewarding. Were there impediments on 
campus to either of those goals, enrollment and

29:59.851 --> 30:09.004
research? Were there any handicaps? Not really 
that the institution imposed.

30:16.174 --> 30:23.344
I think, you know, in most cases, we tend to, Those 
sort of limitations tend to be self-imposed for

30:25.737 --> 30:31.484
one reason or the other.

30:36.970 --> 30:44.118
So I always viewed the institution as one of our 
real strengths. As you look back on those years,

30:44.138 --> 30:48.403
what were the key courses that a forest science 
major took either in the department or out of it?

30:57.785 --> 31:00.929
There must have been some key courses that were 
submitted. Well,

31:00.949 --> 31:14.728
obviously the first two years are a fairly common 
set of courses that either by requirement or

31:15.198 --> 31:27.298
whatever everybody takes, and certainly it's the 
case now with the core curriculum. But we had a core

31:27.318 --> 31:36.694
curriculum that was more on a departmental level 
than it was on an institutional level. I'd say once

31:37.676 --> 31:41.442
the student got beyond the the sophomore year.
