WEBVTT

00:04.115 --> 00:06.378
Did you like teaching? Oh, yes. Now that you're on 
the other side here. Very much so. I alluded to

00:15.132 --> 00:24.526
something about mass punishment earlier in our 
talk.

00:27.731 --> 00:31.557
The cadet wing Air Force Wing

00:33.578 --> 00:40.845
saw fit to campus all of its juniors at one time. 
What happened, somebody let the air out of all the

00:42.967 --> 00:46.591
seniors' tires. The seniors had a parking lot, 
they may still have, where only seniors could

00:46.691 --> 00:52.777
park. So somebody let the air out of their tires. 
And all the seniors got together and they camped

00:55.900 --> 00:58.642
with the juniors. Well, at that time, I was the 
senior instructor for Air Science 4, which are the

01:02.688 --> 01:09.358
seniors. And I had three, four other instructors 
who were also teaching Air Science 4. And I said,

01:17.890 --> 01:20.173
now, I'm getting ready to do something. I don't 
want you to criticize what I'm doing. I'm not

01:25.601 --> 01:27.223
asking that you do it. And if you're questioned by 
any of your students, just make some remark, well,

01:32.405 --> 01:37.372
I haven't even thought about that, or I haven't 
heard about it, or whatever you want to say. Just

01:37.672 --> 01:38.874
don't get in the act. So, first class, I walk in, and 
of course they come to attention. Good morning,

01:46.063 --> 01:47.285
gentlemen. This morning, before we take up the 
lesson for the day, we're going to have a standby

01:48.667 --> 01:53.954
inspection of uniform. I just went down the line 
and said, mister, I said, Isn't your tie tucked in

02:00.012 --> 02:02.594
at the wrong place? Doesn't it belong between the 
second and third button? Yes, sir. Okay, that's

02:07.538 --> 02:09.140
two diversions. Everybody in here says that's two 
diversions. Take a seat. I had three sections.

02:17.447 --> 02:19.268
Second section came along, same thing. Mister, 
don't you have on the wrong color sock? I've never

02:25.153 --> 02:28.356
seen that color sock with a uniform. Yes, sir. 
That's it. Non-rigged socks, that's two

02:30.522 --> 02:32.705
demerits, isn't it? Yes, sir. I said, everyone in 
the section is assessed two demerits. Take your

02:36.511 --> 02:38.494
seats. Third section came along, did the same 
thing. When the first section came back to class

02:41.518 --> 02:47.767
two days later, good morning, gentlemen. We're 
going to have a standby inspection again this

02:47.787 --> 02:50.812
morning. The wing commander was in that class. He 
said, sir, may I speak? I said, yes, sir. I said,

02:58.973 --> 03:04.540
Major, are you trying to tell us that mass 
punishment is wrong? I said, well, it didn't take

03:06.883 --> 03:09.126
you long to learn, did it? He said, well, for your 
information, we have released the juniors from

03:10.708 --> 03:16.455
their restriction to campus. I said, for your 
information, all those who are still on my desk may

03:17.937 --> 03:24.205
have gone to the Commandant's office. Get your ass 
out of here and go find out who let the air out of your

03:25.433 --> 03:31.519
tires and then punish them to the hilt. And it 
worked.

03:37.424 --> 03:42.729
Not only those three sections, but it spread 
through all the other sections. Well, I had some

03:42.749 --> 03:48.574
real interesting times.

03:48.594 --> 03:53.939
I was the sponsor of Squadron 7. Squadron 7 may not 
be what it used to be. But at that time, it was the top

03:58.168 --> 04:06.036
unit on the campus. I mean, scholastically, 
intramurally, it just took all of the trophies.

04:14.606 --> 04:17.148
And this was two years, the first two years I was 
there. And one day this Colonel John Way, who was a

04:19.050 --> 04:25.157
professor of air science, said, you know, when 
you're on top, It's easy to stay on top. I said, why

04:28.651 --> 04:31.155
don't you go get something that you don't have? I 
said, you name it, Colonel. What is it? He says,

04:35.721 --> 04:43.112
let's see you take the Houston military away from 
that infantry outfit. We'll do it. So I went down to

04:44.394 --> 04:47.959
squadron seven and called us cadet officers in. I 
said, you've got a challenge, because I'm going to

04:48.020 --> 04:52.086
give you the challenge. And I've got the challenge 
because the colonel put it on me. I said, we're

04:55.883 --> 04:58.487
going to win the Houston military. God, our outfit 
could never win that. Hell, it can't. And of

05:03.994 --> 05:11.424
course, the march-ins at football games are 
graded, and certain march-ins to the dining hall

05:03.994 --> 05:11.424
are graded. Everything military goes to the 
Houston military. Sure enough, Mother's Day,

05:16.732 --> 05:23.701
when it was announced, Squadron 7, Houston 
military. Well... That year I had a compassionate

05:24.942 --> 05:36.382
reassignment from A&M up to that Aviation 
Engineer Force because one of our children was

05:24.942 --> 05:36.382
sick and ultimately died.

05:38.826 --> 05:45.357
When Final Review came around, have you ever seen a 
Final Review before? When Final Review came

05:45.377 --> 05:48.402
around and First time they came around, you know, 
they saluted the commandant and all that

05:49.715 --> 05:53.159
business. And then they all went back out and got in 
the huddle, you know, and they put on their bars and

05:53.179 --> 06:01.650
everything, you know, and turned everything over 
to the juniors, and the juniors stepped up. They

06:01.670 --> 06:15.647
came walking across that field, and they handed me 
four sets of ropes, and it was all of them, the

06:01.670 --> 06:15.647
scholastic, the intramural,

06:01.670 --> 06:15.647
whatever the other one was, and then the Houston 
military. They said, here, Major. We know you

06:16.799 --> 06:20.525
can't wear them, but you can do something with 
them. And we had just built up a spree that, by

06:20.545 --> 06:32.744
golly, I stepped back, and they ran their outfit, 
and they came to me when they needed help, when they

06:20.545 --> 06:32.744
wanted something. And

06:32.764 --> 06:39.074
it was just one of the greatest things that had ever 
happened to me. A bunch of cadets were doing it.

06:43.942 --> 06:44.443
But... That old professor, he said, I never 
thought it would happen. I said, John, all you've

06:48.201 --> 06:52.627
got to do is just have a good bunch of cadets. He was 
from Oklahoma. I said, now you Hokies just don't

06:54.390 --> 06:59.917
understand. He died here last year.

07:04.223 --> 07:08.048
Were you sorry to leave AM99 after three years? Or 
were you ready for a transfer? Oh, I think we were

07:10.271 --> 07:11.393
ready. Our daughter contracted polio and an 
epidemic they had up there. She ultimately died of

07:19.940 --> 07:25.270
bronchial

07:19.940 --> 07:25.270
pneumonia. But I was ready to get moving

07:25.290 --> 07:31.542
and let's start.

07:40.870 --> 07:52.024
So your next assignment then was Director of 
Operations, Aviation, Engineering, Engineer

07:40.870 --> 07:52.024
Force, which you had from 1955 to 1956. Now, what 
were your functions there? And where was it

07:57.351 --> 08:02.037
first? Well, the Aviation Engineer Force was 
there at Walters, Mineral Wells. Oh, okay. Yeah.

08:08.965 --> 08:09.625
Which you talked about. Right. Yeah. And 
Navigation Engine Air Force is exactly what it

08:11.147 --> 08:14.891
said. It was, believe it or not, it was a bunch of 
Army troops that also had Air Force enlisted

08:14.991 --> 08:28.006
personnel and Air Force officers assigned to 
them. And they were under the control of the Air

08:28.026 --> 08:33.912
Force under a term called SCARWAW. Special 
Category Army with Air Force. And they were

08:39.438 --> 08:52.291
dedicated solely to construction of Air Force 
installations and bases and wherever the Air

08:39.438 --> 08:52.291
Force wanted them to go. And I had both operations 
and then at one time planned the program, which was

09:01.870 --> 09:25.971
worldwide assignment and utilization, war and 
peace, and figuring out how many battalions,

09:01.870 --> 09:25.971
regiments, brigades were needed in various parts 
of the country to support

09:01.870 --> 09:25.971
whatever the mission was and how many flying units 
we had.

09:28.280 --> 09:43.379
I guess one of the most interesting projects that 
we worked on, though, was I had an Army captain and

09:28.280 --> 09:43.379
an Air Force captain working for me, and we put 
together a manual that had never been assembled. I

09:43.439 --> 09:57.477
mean, you could go here and get this and here and get 
that, but we assembled a manual that could

09:43.439 --> 09:57.477
actually be carried onto a job, and it was recovery 
of an Air Force installation following nuclear

09:43.439 --> 09:57.477
attack. so that they didn't have to carry a library 
as big as that over there. They just carried one

10:04.043 --> 10:07.168
manual, and the whole thing was there. And it took 
us about six months to put the thing together, and

10:07.188 --> 10:13.758
it was ultimately published. And even though they 
abolished SCARWOF, and all those Army troops went

10:13.778 --> 10:26.316
back to the Army, and our Air Force went back into 
our own engineering units, base maintenance

10:13.778 --> 10:26.316
units, We still buy copies of the manual around.

10:32.948 --> 10:38.453
Of course, this was a period when the atomic bomb 
and, well, when we were building up our atomic

10:32.948 --> 10:38.453
arsenal. Was there a lot of interest within the Air 
Force at this time?

10:50.566 --> 10:51.287
Oh, yeah, very definitely. I used to kid my 
contemporaries that If I went over to the Planning

10:57.734 --> 11:11.469
and Programming Office, over on one corner of the 
desk, I had worldwide utilization of aviation

10:57.734 --> 11:11.469
engineer forces, and then over on this, return of 
SCARWAC units to the Army. If a breeze came along

11:12.370 --> 11:24.703
and mixed these papers, you know, well, that was 
the biggest job we had for months, because here we

11:12.370 --> 11:24.703
were planning how to use these guys for years in a 
war and peace, and over here, I'll give them back to

11:25.308 --> 11:27.471
the Army within 30 days. But you go through that 
quite often. Of course, this is a time when the Air

11:33.220 --> 11:43.837
Force is enlarging, and we're getting now into 
strategic air command. Were you building a lot of

11:44.558 --> 11:52.370
air bases at this time? Yeah. because of the 
agreements with the labor and so on, these units

11:54.333 --> 12:22.247
would stay in a training status most of the time, 
but could be used downrange, down the Bahamas, in

11:54.333 --> 12:22.247
Iceland, and we could use them in the Pacific, but 
not in the Connus in the continental United States

12:22.818 --> 12:33.294
because that was to be left open for bidding on the 
economy. What were the major bases that you built?

12:37.120 --> 12:47.897
Well, no base per se, but additional facilities at 
Thule, for instance, at Hickam itself. So you were

12:49.598 --> 12:52.602
back in the construction field. Yeah. And at 
Tachikawa in Japan, at Clark.

13:03.217 --> 13:11.989
Did you have any dealings with any of the building 
that was going on in the new line, any of the

13:03.217 --> 13:11.989
Canadian strategic defenses at that time? No, I 
didn't at that time. I did later on, but not at that

13:13.631 --> 13:16.635
time. of course this is a time with the enlargement 
of the strategic air command did you have any

13:18.758 --> 13:41.577
dealings with any construction as far as they were 
concerned no see most of theirs were caught us and

13:18.758 --> 13:41.577
they'd be under contract under contract okay and 
of course this is the 50s was an era when general

13:18.758 --> 13:41.577
curtis lemay was very influential in the airport 
did you ever have an opportunity to meet him or see

13:42.400 --> 14:09.133
him i have not only met the general i have briefed 
him i've helped dressed him really oh yeah oh would

13:42.400 --> 14:09.133
you tell me about that well when i say i helped dress 
him later in in the career let's see that'd be three

13:42.400 --> 14:09.133
four four years after this Air Force, when LeMay 
was chief of staff, I had to brief General LeMay.

14:18.381 --> 14:21.485
General Bradley was then the vice chief. And he 
said, now, remember, speak directly to him. And

14:28.353 --> 14:35.100
don't look at me, because he's hard of hearing, and 
he will not wear a hearing aid.

14:38.104 --> 14:39.205
But be distinct. Of course, I'd had all of this 
already, and it didn't bother me because I had

14:39.607 --> 14:46.618
reached bigger people in LeMay. LeMay comes in to 
the room, and he leans over like this to sit down,

14:48.881 --> 15:03.403
and these four stars had come on the hook, and they 
just started swinging like this. And he looked

15:04.008 --> 15:06.811
like a roar of Boer Alice. There were so many stars 
just swinging through the air. And I said,

15:09.073 --> 15:10.975
gentlemen, your stars are falling. Your stars are 
falling. God damn, this little man didn't get

15:12.517 --> 15:15.399
those things fixed right. Here, hook him up. So 
with that, I don't know whether you heard the rest

15:19.063 --> 15:23.568
of the briefing or not.

15:30.174 --> 15:30.775
We had a We've jumped four years, but he's a very 
outspoken man, which is great. By the way, he was an

15:41.999 --> 15:46.123
Ohio State civil engineer. I don't know whether 
you knew that or not, but even engineers become

15:47.525 --> 15:53.611
pretty good leaders. We were getting ready to 
modernize the officer's club at Bowling. There

16:02.783 --> 16:07.507
were a couple of concepts as to how to do it. And oh 
boy, we're seven or eight years ahead now. Because

16:12.652 --> 16:17.216
by that time, I was in the Secretary of the Air Force 
office. And there was a group in his office with a

16:17.236 --> 16:23.562
model of the officer's club. And there must have 
been about 16 or 18 officers, including me. They

16:32.247 --> 16:35.551
got to talking about the concept. And now, see, 
here everybody works for him except me, and I work

16:36.872 --> 16:42.819
for the Secretary of the Air Force. And one of these 
guys says, General LeMay, Mr. Zuckert, who is the

16:43.580 --> 16:52.390
Secretary of the Air Force, Mr. Zuckert thinks 
that we ought to do so-and-so.

16:54.833 --> 16:55.674
Oh, you know that stuff. Oh, you go tell Mr. Zuckert 
to piss off a rope. Now he's talking about my boss.

17:04.309 --> 17:15.319
And about half those eyes look at me like, what's 
Zucker going to

17:04.309 --> 17:15.319
do? He was exactly what was needed at the time.

17:23.226 --> 17:27.891
Capable individual.

17:27.911 --> 17:30.233
Not afraid to speak out. I'm sure that

17:31.748 --> 17:43.121
we bought time with a lot of his boldness, his 
bluff, and that we needed. Was there a friction

17:44.622 --> 17:48.847
between the Strategic Air Command and other parts 
of the Air Force? Always is. Why? Well, you trace as

17:53.492 --> 18:00.760
a rule who would go to the top. to run the Air Force, 
you'd always find that they came out of the

18:02.393 --> 18:07.541
strategic command. Strategic air command would 
graduate to the top.

18:14.151 --> 18:22.944
And training command and tactical air command did 
never make it up. They'd make it so high, but they'd

18:22.964 --> 18:25.047
never get to the top. And so that's most of it.

18:32.650 --> 18:45.772
That is not really where most of the

18:32.650 --> 18:45.772
animosity

18:32.650 --> 18:45.772
and friction really is. There are other places 
that have friction.

18:54.025 --> 18:56.970
In our business,

18:58.098 --> 19:02.022
And it didn't bother me, because I wore a blue suit. 
But

19:02.102 --> 19:21.982
remember I said earlier that at West Point, when 
you graduated, and they rank the class, and then

19:02.102 --> 19:21.982
everybody gets to pick what branch they want to go 
into.

19:23.303 --> 19:27.227
The top of the class usually picks the Corps of 
Engineers. It's a good honorable profession and

19:28.507 --> 19:35.314
it provides you something to do after you leave the 
service. It's a damn good service to be in. And then

19:41.321 --> 19:42.782
they go on down the line. And the bottom is the 
infantry.

19:49.069 --> 19:54.995
Well, years ago this happened and still does. And 
so before the Air Force had its own academy, before

19:57.869 --> 20:15.489
the Air Force started building its own system, 
this guy would say, I'm going to aviation cadets

19:57.869 --> 20:15.489
before I go to the infantry.

20:15.509 --> 20:26.661
OK, now you've got a guy that's down here in the 
bottom quarter of the class that went to aviation

20:15.509 --> 20:26.661
cadets

20:15.509 --> 20:26.661
instead of going to the infantry. which he would 
have had to done, because there was none of this

20:27.485 --> 20:32.330
other choice assignments left. He comes out of 
aviation cadets, and all these guys go along for 25

20:34.972 --> 20:55.652
years, and now here you got, at the top of the Air 
Force, a guy that was in the bottom quarter of the

20:34.972 --> 20:55.652
class, and you got this engineer group sitting 
over here that was at the top of the class, and

20:34.972 --> 20:55.652
they're just like that.

20:57.978 --> 21:07.769
Now, it's getting better as we get our own people 
out of the Air Force Academy. Because we're not

21:07.789 --> 21:19.001
getting as many of this bottom quarter coming out 
of West Point or coming out of Annapolis or Point.

21:19.021 --> 21:21.404
Let me tell you, it was rough. I mean, again, not me, 
because I'm wearing blue. But you go in to brief one

21:25.128 --> 21:27.951
of these commanders and tell him, The core, don't 
tell me about the core. Just, you know, turn

21:33.904 --> 21:35.346
themselves off. I don't believe it. You go back 
over there and you tell that core, you know.

21:40.633 --> 21:43.437
There's just a lot of animosity in between. And, 
you know, you can expect it. It's built in. I mean,

21:46.320 --> 21:47.622
it's there. Anytime you've got the rank and file 
system,

21:48.223 --> 21:55.913
and they can carry it for years.

22:12.734 --> 22:23.167
Well, we jumped from a... Well, I wanted to ask 
about the Mayan SAC because these things are very

22:12.734 --> 22:23.167
important as far as the history of the Air Force is 
concerned. And they're always interested in

22:23.187 --> 22:34.582
problems or the relationship between some people 
who aren't in the Strategic Air Command and those

22:23.187 --> 22:34.582
who are. Well, fortunately, we've got a thing 
right now that is going to help We have a four-star

22:43.497 --> 22:52.305
general in command of the training command whose 
headquarters is here at Randolph. And on the 28th

22:52.325 --> 22:58.731
of this month, he moves to Sac, and he takes over 
Sac. And he happens to be the youngest four-star

22:59.872 --> 23:03.555
general in the Air Force. He's only 52 years old. So 
he's got some years to go. And conceivably,

23:06.978 --> 23:12.323
General Davis will someday be the chief of staff. 
We've got to remember that he made his fourth star

23:12.725 --> 23:25.442
at training command, not at SAC, and quite a 
capable individual.

23:25.462 --> 23:41.803
What we've got, believe it or not right now, is 
we've got a little tug and push and shove between

23:25.462 --> 23:41.803
research and developers and tacticians.

23:43.285 --> 23:45.307
Sure.

23:46.689 --> 23:48.691
And that's not all bad. Not all bad. If the research 
and developers can come up with some fancy beam

23:53.255 --> 24:12.415
warfare that makes it quicker and saves a hell of a 
lot of lives, why should the tacticians always

23:53.255 --> 24:12.415
have the principles of war boss comes and matches 
the first one, you don't always need matches.

24:19.821 --> 24:22.644
Okay, so then you went to France right after that in 
1956. That was terrific. Were you eager to get

24:24.006 --> 24:25.468
overseas again? Well, I hadn't been overseas. 
They offered me Alaska or France and though in my

24:28.692 --> 24:39.685
master's study at A&M I studied Creopediology, 
which is permafrost, I chose France. A little bit

24:45.058 --> 24:48.904
nicer place to live. A little more action. The 
organizations are larger. You got a two-star in

24:55.112 --> 24:57.776
command in Alaska. You got a four-star in command 
in Europe. I

25:01.201 --> 25:08.071
think your chances are better in Europe. We went 
over and I was a resident engineer at two bases. One

25:13.048 --> 25:19.695
has already been completed, but we were 
lengthening the runway and doing some more

25:13.048 --> 25:19.695
facility work. Where was that? That was Shomal. 
Shomal happens to be one of the locations that

25:23.179 --> 25:39.017
Black Jack Pershing had his headquarters during 
World War I. Shomal, Sur Marne, the Marne River.

25:40.027 --> 25:50.482
The other one was Shalon Battery, which was a brand 
new base that had only a runway and a few

25:40.027 --> 25:50.482
facilities. And it was a NATO base. That's what 
NATO gave us here, a runway and a few facilities.

25:58.013 --> 26:02.439
And we were pouring American dollars into 
building another base. And that's where I spent

26:03.681 --> 26:08.127
most of my time.

26:09.777 --> 26:38.653
My deputy was an Army civil servant, and I worked 
with the French ,, which is roads and bridges, who

26:09.777 --> 26:38.653
was the contracting officer to the French 
contractors, even though the work was being done

26:09.777 --> 26:38.653
for us and paid for by us. they left the contract. 
And it was strictly the rapport that he and I

26:41.383 --> 26:54.161
maintained as to how much pressure we put on the 
contractors to deliver what was right and so on.

26:54.181 --> 27:07.780
And we ended up, even though I was not there when it 
was completed, I hadn't been moved to Africa by

26:54.181 --> 27:07.780
then, but a very, very minimum of claims from the 
contractor. At that time, I worked for an Army

27:08.182 --> 27:10.826
colonel. So I was, again, mixed into this joint 
service thing. And I truthfully must say, just by

27:17.676 --> 27:36.585
having lived the Corps life and being able to 
adjust to just about anything, I don't care

27:17.676 --> 27:36.585
whether the guy's Army, Navy, or what. what the guy 
produces, how he treats people.

27:44.836 --> 27:46.718
Anyway, we got along fine. At this time, of course, 
France was still in NATO, and they pulled out a few

27:48.119 --> 27:53.405
years after that. How are the relations with the 
French army, or the French officers? Great.

27:59.691 --> 28:00.032
Great? Still great? Yeah. In 56 and 57? Yep. 
Terrific. Yeah, the fact is, you see, on that whole

28:07.362 --> 28:19.137
tour, I felt this because,

28:07.362 --> 28:19.137
like you say, how it was in relation then. Then when 
I left there and went down to North Africa for a

28:19.618 --> 28:32.695
short period of time and I went to England, that's 
where I really felt it because when we pulled out of

28:19.618 --> 28:32.695
England, I mean pulled out of France, we brought 
them to England, you see. Because there we brought

28:33.080 --> 28:38.588
the units that we pulled out of France. We brought 
them in to England. And that's where we had nuke

28:41.532 --> 28:43.956
storage rights. And I got to England just in time to 
start programming and building up facilities for

28:43.976 --> 28:57.215
those units that just two or three years ahead I had 
helped facilitate over there in France. Chaumont

28:57.235 --> 28:59.779
actually moved from The unit at Chaumont, where 
the 48th Fighter moved from there to Lake and

29:00.485 --> 29:06.492
Heath, England.

29:10.177 --> 29:15.804
Again,

29:10.177 --> 29:15.804
I made the statement, the French individual is 
great. Collectively, they're a bunch of bums.

29:19.348 --> 29:21.211
Especially if they're on the highway. Boy, 
they're horrible. They're the worst drivers I've

29:22.953 --> 29:24.475
ever seen. And in downtown Paris. How many people 
did you have working for you when you were a

29:27.907 --> 29:34.996
resident engineer here in France? About 9 or 10, I 
guess. And were they engineers? Yeah. Yes. And

29:44.727 --> 29:48.552
they were both American and French. Oh. Yeah. And 
so how would it work? The Air Force would say, okay,

29:52.898 --> 30:05.218
we want you to go build this landing strip or 
something like that, or go build a building on this

29:52.898 --> 30:05.218
base, and then you'd sit down and draw the plans? 
No, we did not design it. All we did was just

30:06.800 --> 30:09.024
supervise the construction. Oh, okay. The plans 
came to us from our own organization in Paris.

30:15.093 --> 30:15.614
Okay. That was the joint construction they were 
headed by. Well, it would alternate. One term it

30:20.727 --> 30:25.232
would be an Army guy, the next term it would be a 
Navy, and the next term it would be an Air Force. And

30:25.252 --> 30:28.115
then it would just keep rotating. And it was called 
the Joint Construction Agency. Everybody in

30:31.719 --> 30:34.462
there was just a mixture. Is this Joint 
Construction Agency? Is that a fairly new output?

30:40.148 --> 30:42.270
No, it's no longer in existence. It's no longer OK. 
Yeah. Tell me a little bit about that. I mean, when

30:46.515 --> 30:48.297
did they start this agency? I've never seen it. OK. 
Let's

30:50.660 --> 30:55.064
see. We went over and they started just for the 
task. Why do they have this agency? They started

31:02.632 --> 31:12.002
just for the task of building bases?

31:12.022 --> 31:12.362
Let's see. We went over. It must

31:14.573 --> 31:25.230
have started about 51 or 52. And when we left there 
to go down to Africa, it was phasing down then. And

31:35.446 --> 31:40.294
the only reason they pulled me out early is the 
officer that I had worked for at the Aviation and

31:41.759 --> 31:48.107
Air Force asked for me in Africa. He was down there. 
And he asked, he says, since you're phasing down,

31:49.068 --> 31:54.976
can you send Johnson to me now? He'd been trying for 
a year to get me down here. And so they finally said,

31:57.860 --> 31:59.762
yeah, we'll let him go. Now, why did they even have 
this agency, the Joint Construction Agency? Just

32:05.229 --> 32:09.555
to explain, why did they even institute it?

32:11.898 --> 32:41.230
I can't

32:11.898 --> 32:41.230
answer the question

32:11.898 --> 32:41.230
with 100% assurance that I'm right, because

32:11.898 --> 32:41.230
there was so much demand for construction 
throughout, I have to remember where all it was

32:11.898 --> 32:41.230
now, in Italy. in Greece, Spain, in Germany, in 
France, that somebody made the decision that it

32:41.783 --> 33:07.588
was bigger than the Corps of Engineers could 
handle on its own, and that the Navy ought to have a

32:41.783 --> 33:07.588
voice in it, and the Air Force ought to have a voice 
in it, especially when it affected their own civil

33:07.771 --> 33:11.335
combat agency. So they formed this thing. Now, 
when it fell apart at the time I went to Africa, then

33:13.258 --> 33:32.342
it went back to Army everywhere in Europe except 
England, and that belongs to the Air Force, and the

33:13.258 --> 33:32.342
Navy in Spain. And the Army has all the rest of it, 
even now. So the building then, they had

33:38.348 --> 33:45.278
accomplished the mission of that building in 
those six or seven years that it was in existence.

33:45.299 --> 33:50.406
And then they decided to phase it out, and the Corps 
could handle whatever building was necessary.

33:51.067 --> 33:52.249
OK. All right. So you went to Libya in 1957 as

33:52.870 --> 33:59.119
the director engineer. And construction, 
engineering and construction. I had 36 people

34:02.665 --> 34:05.569
working for me there. And we had. Did they give you a 
promotion or not? No, I was still a major. I made

34:10.321 --> 34:13.745
Lieutenant Colonel while there.

34:15.507 --> 34:21.896
We had Morocco, Libya, Italy, Greece, and Turkey. 
That's where our units were scattered, in those

34:23.358 --> 34:28.524
five countries.

34:31.629 --> 34:32.970
Well, it wasn't too bad. We had one base in Italy. We 
had one base in Greece, we had two in Morocco, we had

34:36.753 --> 34:52.113
one in Libya, but we had about five or six in Turkey 
and Crete.

34:52.133 --> 34:54.416
A good bit of traveling then. So did you travel 
around from base to base doing any, you know,

34:54.516 --> 35:02.146
anytime they needed some construction?

35:04.530 --> 35:04.850
Yeah. Were there major operations? We

35:07.516 --> 35:13.503
handled two different types of operations. At 
that time, a

35:13.523 --> 35:27.821
minor construction project was something that 
ran from $25,000 to $100,000. And that we could

35:28.002 --> 35:37.253
design, and if the command had the money, commit 
the money and go. If it was major construction, it

35:37.773 --> 35:44.420
had to go before the Congress for congressional 
approval and appropriation. We would work with

35:46.341 --> 35:54.289
the programmers to define it, and the programmers 
would put it on the documents and get it on up the

35:46.341 --> 35:54.289
line and then get it approved. Once it was 
approved, then we would work with the Corps of

35:54.550 --> 36:03.038
Engineers to see that they designed what we 
intended to have built. and they'd take over and

36:03.524 --> 36:13.522
finish the design, let the contract, supervise 
the contract, and then we would run the acceptance

36:03.524 --> 36:13.522
inspection and so on. So it's kind of a split 
operation. It's part of what the magnitude was.

36:21.557 --> 36:27.287
Like a big hangar at Tripoli, Libya, Wheeler. All 
that we did was define the project and say, this is

36:28.094 --> 36:35.382
what we want, and then look over the core shoulder 
and say, OK, we agree with the design. Build it. And

36:36.643 --> 36:38.885
then they'd build it. Did Mrs. Johnson get to go 
with you to Libya? Yes, and both boys. We have two

36:44.071 --> 36:45.873
boys. So she was in France with you and in Libya, and 
then in the United Kingdom? Yeah. Oh, good. So what

36:52.940 --> 36:55.603
were the conditions like in Libya? Well, when we 
were there they were great because we moved right

36:56.545 --> 37:07.037
into the first place we lived was a brand new 
masonry house. So new that it hadn't even seasoned

37:08.639 --> 37:19.431
and you could be sitting like we are here talking 
and least little rise in temperature and

37:08.639 --> 37:19.431
something would go. And a seed would pop out of a 
little plaster. They hadn't used clean sand, and

37:23.461 --> 37:27.205
it was a grass seed, you know. We'd be talking some 
more, and something would go... And another one

37:28.026 --> 37:33.212
would pop out up there. But all in all, they were 
good. And we moved from there to another, what they

37:34.874 --> 37:39.919
call, villa. And then, ultimately, we moved on 
base in the base quarters.

37:46.887 --> 37:47.848
We had... I'd say an above average houseboy. The 
women don't work down there. The men work. You can

37:54.990 --> 37:59.276
do the domestic work. We found it pretty 
interesting.

38:03.541 --> 38:12.513
It gave my older boy, or our older boy, a challenge 
in life and an outlook that has led to his

38:03.541 --> 38:12.513
profession. He is a graduate of American 
University.

38:19.823 --> 38:26.049
International Relations and his postgraduate 
master's degree from the University of Utah. He is

38:26.769 --> 38:29.472
a Persian expert. He speaks Arabic, Fazi, French, 
as well as English. He happens to be a major in the

38:34.416 --> 38:38.300
Air Force. That is interesting. And this is where 
he picked up that interest. That first challenge.

38:45.866 --> 38:49.830
Well, why did you only stay there for about a year 
and then go to the United Kingdom in 1959? The tour

38:50.587 --> 38:56.515
in Libya is what they call a short tour. And I 
offered them a short extension in Libya or a long

38:57.296 --> 39:09.734
extension in the United Kingdom. And the 
personnel people and the civil engineer people

39:09.754 --> 39:15.522
got to wrestling. And they said, well, under the 
conditions, what's happening in the United

39:15.542 --> 39:20.509
Kingdom? let's move into the United Kingdom. And 
what was happening that they needed to? That's

39:26.064 --> 39:34.536
when these units in France were being programmed 
into England and into Germany. Okay, let's talk

39:34.556 --> 39:35.777
about this. I've heard some interesting comments 
about when we moved out of France. Okay, the

39:45.210 --> 39:49.416
project of the move of Air Force units from France 
to England was called Red Richard. That was the

39:55.373 --> 39:56.254
code word. It was an unclassified code word. But 
anything that was Red Richard, everybody knew

39:58.638 --> 40:10.777
money-wise, program-wise, that was to get a unit 
or had to do with moving from France to the United

39:58.638 --> 40:10.777
Kingdom. And I

40:10.797 --> 40:15.825
was titled Director of Project Management. I had 
master planning, planning, programming, and

40:19.117 --> 40:44.462
fiscal control under me in the United Kingdom in 
civil engineering, which put me right in sitting

40:19.117 --> 40:44.462
with the commanders and the engineers and the 
general from headquarters Air Force Europe that

40:44.965 --> 40:52.532
with the units moving out as to what they needed and 
what had to be done to the bases that, you know, that

40:44.965 --> 40:52.532
they were designated to go to and so on. What we had 
to do with emergency money, which is, you know, the

40:53.393 --> 41:02.100
money that we had right now that we could use, what 
we had to go back to Congress to get approval on and

40:53.393 --> 41:02.100
so on. But the project was called Red Richard. And 
it was just one of those all-night, all-day

41:04.843 --> 41:11.549
things. You get it done and... What were the 
feelings toward the French in your command at this

41:13.838 --> 41:18.102
time?

41:21.105 --> 41:29.873
Well, I think the feeling in our command,

41:21.105 --> 41:29.873
being on the continent, those units weren't in our 
command. They were in the 16th Air Force, I guess it

41:29.933 --> 41:35.959
was. And everybody in the United Kingdom was in the 
3rd Air Force. Well, they weren't our units until

41:39.082 --> 41:42.765
they moved to us. You know, in the United Kingdom, 
it was kind of nice a lot. But the overall feeling

41:47.635 --> 41:54.385
was that, you know, the French have really slipped 
through, after all. For years, we've been pouring

41:54.405 --> 41:56.287
money into there. And for years, they've been part 
of the program. And now, this has happened.

42:04.699 --> 42:10.086
But even now, today, in 81, you know, they're not 
completely out of it. No. You know? It's a crazy

42:11.416 --> 42:23.832
agreement or arrangement, but

42:11.416 --> 42:23.832
it's been harmful to the total force, but we've 
lived with it. I've heard some comments from other

42:23.853 --> 42:40.815
generals saying that when the American forces 
moved out of France and moved everything, even the

42:23.853 --> 42:40.815
telephones and everything that they could, it was 
at the... Was that the order that came down from

42:41.572 --> 42:43.374
Tom? Well... Or was that just resentment?

42:52.084 --> 42:52.204
No. I wouldn't say it was resentment. I'd say that 
was, you know, move whatever you can. You know,

42:56.850 --> 43:02.456
you've got to make this move with the least amount 
of additional expenditure. At Chambord, when we

43:03.518 --> 43:09.925
first got to France as a resident engineer and Our 
first quarters were on Showmont. Later we moved

43:11.849 --> 43:14.513
over near the other base.

43:16.356 --> 43:31.476
That weekend or the very next weekend, they 
dedicated a Statue of Liberty that bronze or brass

43:16.356 --> 43:31.476
was about that tall, standing on a pedestal that 
was again about that tall. And that thing had been

43:31.496 --> 43:39.287
built from the pattern that the statue is made in 
the New York Harbor. But when that unit moved from

43:40.212 --> 43:48.620
Showmont to Lake and Heath, they even took the 
Statue of Liberty with them. Vive la France, and

43:50.562 --> 43:53.425
we're back to help in all this business. And then 
two years later, you can stay, but your nukes have

43:53.505 --> 43:57.509
got to go. Well, what does a nuclear force do?

44:04.436 --> 44:08.380
Where did you store the nuclear weapons that 
America had in France? Yeah, did we store them back

44:09.052 --> 44:12.637
in Great Britain? Oh, yeah. Yeah, we've got 
terrific storage facilities in Britain. And did

44:18.525 --> 44:19.947
you help construct those? Oh, yeah. Some of the 
units, though, now went to Germany. All of them did

44:24.253 --> 44:25.895
not go to England. We picked up there were, in 
France, there was nuclear

44:25.915 --> 44:36.109
either three or four wings. We got two of them in and 
Germany got through them. The rest were

44:40.549 --> 44:44.394
transported out. The pressure wasn't on on them. 
They ultimately moved them out also. The pressure

44:48.359 --> 44:54.107
was to maintain the nuclear force in Europe.

44:59.194 --> 45:06.244
Was there special problems with building sites 
where you could store nuclear weapons? No. But we

45:08.030 --> 45:10.654
already had them. We already had nuclear weapons 
in England. And so you just, you didn't have to

45:13.698 --> 45:16.943
expand them, they were large enough? No, they had 
to be expanded.

45:22.250 --> 45:34.628
Bases were, like we had a combination of

45:22.250 --> 45:34.628
Bentwater's Woodbridge, two bases about six 
miles apart, that one wing had. It had two

45:36.033 --> 45:38.896
squadrons on one location and one on the other. We 
put another squadron in there that belonged to one

45:39.537 --> 45:42.961
of these outfits coming in. So you build up a little 
more facility. But fortunately in England, where

45:48.206 --> 46:03.923
we have ammo and nuke storage, the British had 
pretty good foresight and put sufficient

45:48.206 --> 46:03.923
clearance around them.

46:09.758 --> 46:15.987
So was that your major task when you were in England 
for those two years, 1959 and 1960? Yeah, I guess it

46:17.730 --> 46:21.115
was for that period.

46:29.086 --> 46:36.357
Two

46:29.086 --> 46:36.357
interesting things happened then. You asked 
earlier, way back there before A&M, I happened to

46:37.923 --> 46:49.916
be the district commissioner of the Mayflower 
District of the Boy Scouts of America. And that was

46:49.956 --> 46:54.761
just made up of Boy Scout units in the United 
Kingdom. So that was a freebie job, a service job.

46:59.426 --> 47:06.073
And the man that I worked for in England during that 
time period was the first one that my own

47:06.678 --> 47:09.617
effectiveness report ever since.
