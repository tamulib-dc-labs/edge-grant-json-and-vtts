WEBVTT

00:10.460 --> 00:14.844
You'd go talk to him, particularly for his 
numbers. He always had this old, humongous

00:14.864 --> 00:21.310
1,000-key calculator, I guess. I don't know. And 
he would sit there. Well, it was on this side

00:23.632 --> 00:25.253
because he was left-handed. And he'd run some 
numbers, and he'd crunch numbers on that thing,

00:26.494 --> 00:34.401
and it would hum and whir and clank and everything, 
and he'd have the answer for you. But no, Clark was a

00:34.902 --> 00:38.505
delight to work with. In fact, Really all the 
directors that I worked with were, we were, we had a

00:39.535 --> 00:46.545
really good group. And a smooth relationship. 
Yeah, a smooth relationship. And also between

00:50.591 --> 00:52.433
Diebel and Cherry. Yeah, oh yeah, yeah, yeah. Now 
where was Howard Vestal at that time? Howard

00:56.699 --> 01:01.486
Vestal was, then he was director of auxiliary 
enterprises. Oh, okay. You know, like the housing

01:02.548 --> 01:08.496
operations in the airport and So that in those 
years, you didn't report through him? No, no. In

01:13.465 --> 01:19.752
fact,

01:13.465 --> 01:19.752
Tom Cherry had no assistants or anything like 
that. He had five or six directors, I guess,

01:20.433 --> 01:32.526
because he had Clark Diebel and Wes Donaldson 
purchasing, Ray Smith, myself, Logan Council,

01:20.433 --> 01:32.526
and Clark Diebel. I don't think I missed anybody. 
All right, as you first, you took over then for Bob

01:35.543 --> 01:41.192
Rucker. Yes. When was that? That was in, I believe 
September of, either September or early October

01:43.356 --> 01:48.765
of 73. 73. All right, describe then the campus for 
which you were responsible, what were its

01:49.686 --> 02:02.547
dimensions, and what were the good and bad points 
that you had to deal with in terms of realities and

02:03.421 --> 02:11.812
who were the key people that you had then reporting 
to you? Okay. In 1973 the basic

02:13.434 --> 02:25.429
dimensions of our what we call our public areas 
that we maintained were really within the bounds

02:27.046 --> 02:38.711
of Texas Avenue, Jersey then, Welbon Road, and 
University Drive, with exception to the Hensel

02:27.046 --> 02:38.711
Park area where we were. We had some maintenance 
there. We had a little bit of maintenance over west

02:40.354 --> 02:45.345
of the tracks. We had an old creamery building 
which stood right in the middle of the now entrance

02:46.688 --> 03:02.330
to the west campus, the vet school building, the 
entomology field lab, and I believe that was all.

03:04.033 --> 03:04.914
Yeah, that was all. One of the biggest problems I 
had was there had never been any real coordination

03:17.300 --> 03:45.636
between our activities and facilities planning 
construction and you know I'd come out and there's

03:17.300 --> 03:45.636
somebody would be tearing something up and I'd go 
find out hey what what how when where this kind of

03:17.300 --> 03:45.636
thing so finally General Ludeke who was the 
facilities planning area reported to him he was a

03:17.300 --> 03:45.636
vice president he said and Bob had gone to a few of 
them but he said you know He said, I think I need you

03:46.223 --> 03:52.350
sitting in on my weekly staff meetings on Friday 
morning, just for coordination. And that was

03:52.971 --> 03:53.692
great. Sitting in on what? On Ludicrous, our 
Ludicrous staff meetings, where I think Joe Adams

03:56.335 --> 04:14.998
was director of facilities planning, and I think 
Paul Stevens, Paul Stevens and Charles Brunt were

03:56.335 --> 04:14.998
the other two, one construction, the other one for 
the design area. And that got me talking to them on a

04:15.502 --> 04:26.096
regular basis, you know, and developing some 
rapport and all like that. And finally we got to a

04:26.377 --> 04:37.592
point where I was being involved or we were being 
involved in all the design reviews and all like

04:26.377 --> 04:37.592
this so we could provide input. And it got to a point 
that they didn't do anything without me checking

04:45.286 --> 05:08.425
with us and all like this but what before that what 
had happened is that the average working person

04:45.286 --> 05:08.425
for grounds average gardener or groundskeeper 
they would do something and then sit get torn up

04:45.286 --> 05:08.425
beyond their control and also with physical we had 
some problems with physical plant that i had to

04:45.286 --> 05:08.425
work through and uh then before long they would see 
we could do something and it didn't get torn up, you

05:10.582 --> 05:22.701
know, and there began kind of an evolution of 
change as far as attitudes. And we were able to get

05:24.166 --> 05:33.438
some positions reclassified and where we could 
move some people up a little bit more according to

05:24.166 --> 05:33.438
their abilities. But I had a staff of

05:33.578 --> 05:43.491
Bill Vitapil had then come over as full-time. I 
talked to Mr. Cherry about it. And I think probably

05:45.494 --> 05:50.781
in early 1974, he came over as full-time assistant 
director. And then B.C. Hurt was my lead

05:54.815 --> 05:57.198
supervisor. He was over all the new construction, 
irrigation, and kind of special projects. Frank

06:04.168 --> 06:15.904
Salpatro we hired as, Frank was maybe a foreman or 
something in the grounds, and he was over all the

06:04.168 --> 06:15.904
landscape maintenance, all the mowing, the 
routine day-to-day housekeeping kind of

06:04.168 --> 06:15.904
operations. And then Albert Engelman, he was over 
in facilities planning. And he, um, came over as a

06:22.300 --> 06:28.549
supervisor of our roads and pavement section. And 
that's something that I had to learn a lot about

06:29.150 --> 06:39.705
because I'd never dealt with, with asphalt or 
paving or anything like that in my prior

06:29.150 --> 06:39.705
experience. Uh, then in, um, I guess it was all also 
in, in early. very early 74, that Tom says, you

06:47.596 --> 06:52.902
know, you need a number two person. And Bill 
wasn't, Bill Vitipa wasn't too interested in

06:53.163 --> 06:56.787
that. He was handling the greenhouse operation, 
the annual color, and all the setups for special

06:56.887 --> 07:06.098
events, commencement, and, you know, that kind of 
thing. And so I said, okay. And I started looking,

07:10.343 --> 07:14.107
and then ultimately found Mike Goldwater. And 
Mike came to work. Probably in March or April of 74.

07:21.686 --> 07:30.833
He was in the park system at Arlington, Texas, and 
had a degree from Texas Tech. It's one of those

07:32.028 --> 07:37.254
things that I had two leading candidates for that. 
Both had the same degree, had the same amount of

07:37.975 --> 07:52.973
experience, and either one could have done the 
job, and I guess that's when the good Lord looks

07:37.975 --> 07:52.973
after you, you know, and you make the right choice, 
because Mike was one of these guys that has

07:53.999 --> 07:57.044
knowledge about a little bit of everything. And we 
meshed very nicely. He had a lot of capabilities

08:01.812 --> 08:08.343
that I didn't have and I had some that he didn't 
have. And we got to a point in our working

08:09.545 --> 08:17.037
relationship where we would meet the hallway 
going to each other's office with the same thing

08:17.590 --> 08:38.130
you know I mean it was it was kind of crazy at times 
but without him we couldn't have done a lot of what

08:17.590 --> 08:38.130
we did because he had the knack of handling a lot of 
things like that you know And once we got that set

08:39.157 --> 08:45.467
up, we had a very good organization. We started 
doing some training. And by then, I was very

08:47.690 --> 08:53.579
familiar with budgets and all like this. And we had 
just

08:54.861 --> 09:02.413
the state grounds farm that came in I guess about 
1974 probably and that that helped too because

09:03.676 --> 09:32.738
that basically helped us set aside a dedicated 
amount strictly for our grounds and that let us

09:03.676 --> 09:32.738
start budgeting for a lot of capital capital 
outlay equipment equipment and small projects

09:03.676 --> 09:32.738
and this kind of thing that above and beyond what 
the new facilities would would provide then also

09:33.798 --> 10:03.282
in the in the summer of 74 is when when we started all 
the preparation for the centennial celebration

09:33.798 --> 10:03.282
and a firm landscape architectural firm by the 
name of Mark Newman Dahlberg they did a quote

09:33.798 --> 10:03.282
master plan landscape master plan and

10:03.953 --> 10:26.670
then ultimately out of that came six or seven major 
landscape projects and five street projects or

10:03.953 --> 10:26.670
six street projects and we went through probably 
two years of we had a major landscape project on the

10:27.528 --> 10:43.579
two dormitory areas north and south dorm we had a 
perimeter entrances project which was the north

10:27.528 --> 10:43.579
gate wall which that created lots of 
consternation particularly among the merchants

10:27.528 --> 10:43.579
and you could You could read through some of their 
rhetoric. And they were afraid that we were trying

10:47.893 --> 10:58.363
to keep the kids on our side and that the wall was 
going to have glass embedded in the top and all like

10:47.893 --> 10:58.363
that. And I guess a couple of years after the wall 
was up, I knew we'd made some headway when I had some

10:58.844 --> 11:14.680
kids from the University MYF group at this church. 
And we were driving back towards the church, and

11:15.352 --> 11:22.663
someone said, you know, that wall doesn't look 
half bad. And I thought, boy, we've made some

11:22.683 --> 11:27.049
headway there, you know. But those projects and 
then a number of street projects, and all that was

11:27.830 --> 11:33.278
happening at the same time. And the campus was just 
some of the, we had a student draftsman at the time,

11:33.999 --> 11:40.228
and He kept referring to it as DMZ, you know, 
because of all the fences and all like that. And in

11:50.218 --> 11:59.433
addition to that, we had a number of building 
projects, had a water line project, you know, and

11:50.218 --> 11:59.433
the campus was just torn from A to Z. What was your 
evaluation of the master plan which this company

12:00.134 --> 12:05.863
provided? I had some question marks about it. You 
know, I mean, it had some good parts.

12:15.580 --> 12:24.323
They didn't understand some things about A&M, you 
know.

12:25.585 --> 12:38.298
As an example, in the North Durham area, they 
created a lot of berms and things like this that I

12:25.585 --> 12:38.298
said, no, we don't need those out there, because 
that's where the kids have got to get out and burn

12:25.585 --> 12:38.298
off the energy. And if it's not reasonably usable, 
they said, well, they can lay out on the sun. I said,

12:44.924 --> 12:50.270
they need to get out and throw a ball around and that 
kind of stuff. But I lost that one. Some of the

12:54.290 --> 12:55.471
others we won. The perimeter and entrances, 
fortunately, these projects were farmed out to

12:56.092 --> 13:03.401
other landscape architects. Gene Shrickel, 
Shrickel and Rollins had what we call the North

13:05.183 --> 13:12.412
Plaza Mall, which is all the chemistry fountain 
and all like that. He and his group were a champ to

13:13.593 --> 13:20.702
work with, as well as Hal Stringer, out of Waco who 
did the perimeter and entrances, and that was two

13:21.442 --> 13:24.826
phases. One was the wall along University Drive 
and then the entrance developments at Eastgate

13:25.267 --> 13:36.601
and Westgate and South LaSalle. And we would go to a 
design review both with the North Plaza Mall and

13:38.143 --> 13:46.453
perimeter and entrances. And then they'd come by 
the office and we'd get some things worked out on

13:47.513 --> 14:00.089
what would really work, you know, and they were 
very workable, you know, it, uh, and I think those,

13:47.513 --> 14:00.089
those projects turned out, turned out very well. 
Not that the others didn't, but those probably

14:00.149 --> 14:10.743
were because particularly the perimeter and 
entrances, it gave a definition to the campus and

14:00.149 --> 14:10.743
said, okay, here we are. And we always tried to, 
from, 1973 or four on is to develop a sense that when

14:14.817 --> 14:31.965
a visitor came on campus they got a very positive 
impression because that's the only time you ever

14:14.817 --> 14:31.965
get to make that first impression and it's got to be 
positive. And then later, I think in the 80s, and

14:32.924 --> 14:54.662
you may remember this, I think the Carnegie 
Institute came out with a study in maybe the

14:32.924 --> 14:54.662
mid-80s, early 80s, that 65 or 70 percent of the 
entering freshmen choose a school based on

14:32.924 --> 14:54.662
appearance, you know. And that came out and it kind 
of, I guess, gratified my thoughts about what we

14:55.469 --> 15:05.428
were trying to do is providing the that good first 
impression, as well as a good exterior

15:06.877 --> 15:27.601
environment, because as Bob and I always talked 
and tried to do, is a lot of the youngsters coming to

15:06.877 --> 15:27.601
school, maybe from inner city and this kind of 
thing, they've never had an opportunity to see a

15:06.877 --> 15:27.601
lot of open space and green and this kind of thing. 
Did these outside firms spend enough time

15:28.082 --> 15:36.732
learning about the campus before they started 
doing their designs? I think a few of them did. I'm

15:38.649 --> 15:40.812
not so sure Mark Newman Dahlberg did. And that's 
kind of part of the, I know there for a while,

15:40.852 --> 15:48.704
landscape architect was a dirty word. I mean, very 
seriously, it was a dirty word. I just said, hey,

15:51.809 --> 15:55.114
you know, I'm Director Grounds. But, no, I think 
particularly Strickland Rollins and Hal

15:56.876 --> 16:02.245
Stringer. They spent an inordinate amount of time 
compared to some of the others.

16:10.035 --> 16:15.282
Like all the streets and roads contracts, that was 
pretty cut and dried. We were either replacing,

16:15.302 --> 16:22.412
and I know we got to a real problem when they started 
on replacing the the existing some of these

16:23.067 --> 16:45.868
existing streets on Ross Street because of all the 
street trees and without the street trees we

16:23.067 --> 16:45.868
wouldn't have near the campus that we have today 
and what we had to do when that that it started down

16:23.067 --> 16:45.868
about the architecture building and went west. 
And the facilities planning inspector, his name

16:49.081 --> 16:56.371
is George Reisler, he called me and he said, I think 
we've got a problem. And went up there and the,

16:57.673 --> 17:13.314
they'd done some demolition on the street, 
removed the curbs, and the live oaks, they had just

16:57.673 --> 17:13.314
a proliferation of roots right behind the curbs. 
So we got our heads together to decide what what was

17:16.713 --> 17:18.616
the best avenue to do? We almost knew that we 
couldn't go in and cut the root. To put it back

17:23.302 --> 17:26.967
exactly where it was, you'd have to cut about 12 
inches of the roots off. That would very seriously

17:26.987 --> 17:31.112
damage the trees.

17:32.854 --> 17:40.144
And you can still see it a little bit on Ross Street 
where the curb goes in, and the streets were

17:32.854 --> 17:40.144
narrowed a foot on each side. And I think that, plus 
a lot of the preliminary work that we did in the

17:40.845 --> 17:46.112
trees, the pruning and thinning, And I think we 
probably lost two or three trees out of all those

17:46.733 --> 17:53.801
street projects, which I think I'm very proud of 
that. All right, so they were sensitive on that

17:54.742 --> 17:56.524
issue. Give some examples in the 70s where the 
outside designers listened to y'all and heeded

17:57.144 --> 18:08.317
some advice. And then if you remember any examples 
of where they didn't take your advice. Hmm. I'm

18:17.125 --> 18:19.088
trying to think where they didn't. Most of the time 
they did. Okay. We had it, and I can't remember any

18:23.133 --> 18:33.487
specifics, but I know early on it took a while. We 
couldn't get our comments heard, I think. One was

18:38.454 --> 18:41.197
protection trees and construction areas. And 
finally I found out how to do it. I got it in the Red

18:44.632 --> 18:45.613
Book. And so Mike and I set up and we did a lot of 
sketches and drawings on preferred and needed

18:46.214 --> 18:54.284
tree protection. They'd come in and slap some 
two-by-fours around the trunk and call it

18:54.525 --> 18:59.291
protected. And when we were saying you need to go 
out to the dripland, there's some instances where

18:59.651 --> 19:07.481
that was the only protection that could be 
afforded. But once we got that in the Red Book, then

19:12.290 --> 19:14.753
we would say, refer to Red Book page, whatever, 
whatever. And they say, can't we vary it? No, you

19:17.197 --> 19:18.158
can't. And then we'd have a contractor that would 
damage a tree, maybe inadvertently or whatever.

19:27.992 --> 19:35.362
And we had a method of determining damage by the 
National Arboriculture. It was an international

19:35.423 --> 19:38.106
shade tree conference formula. And we could put a 
pretty good cost figure on that tree based on the

19:41.568 --> 19:48.696
kind of tree it was, where it was, the condition of 
it, and this kind of thing. And we've collected on

19:48.716 --> 19:50.238
it. And Paul Stevens would say on many occasions, 
and Paul and I used to argue at length on a number of

19:50.418 --> 20:04.034
different things, but he'd say, you better 
protect those trees or this man will build you real

19:50.418 --> 20:04.034
quick.

20:07.718 --> 20:11.322
Looking back from the vantage point of the 
present, Should we have varied our tree

20:11.808 --> 20:16.803
collection at that point? Yeah, I think so. Did 
anybody suggest it then? No, and it wasn't until We

20:22.878 --> 20:30.772
started looking at some of that in the mid-80s, I 
guess, and started doing some, well, maybe the

20:22.878 --> 20:30.772
early 80s. We started doing a lot of, for the first 
number of years, best of all, we planted live oaks.

20:36.382 --> 20:40.589
And then we got to talking to some of the pathology 
folks and this kind of thing. And then that's when

20:40.609 --> 20:43.855
we started bringing a lot of other trees. We were 
trying to keep the live oaks primarily as a street

20:45.085 --> 20:55.534
tree to make the aesthetic tie between the main 
campus and west campus. So that there's a lot of

20:55.554 --> 20:57.396
continuity there. But then we started adding a 
number of other tree species. And I think that

21:04.161 --> 21:05.583
helped. And that became more and more evident of 
the need. And we did that as a... you know, as the

21:14.650 --> 21:16.915
years went on. Describe, in general, this whole 
problem of the live oak decline or whatever it's

21:16.935 --> 21:22.488
called. Well, there's two problems with live oaks 
and oaks. First is live oak decline. Live oak

21:31.660 --> 21:54.352
decline is a fairly slow acting disease and it 
normally attacks a live oak when it has been

21:31.660 --> 21:54.352
wounded or and the best correlation I can make to 
that is like a person that is weakened and they get

21:31.660 --> 21:54.352
pneumonia. It's something very similar. And it's 
a fairly slow acting and it's basically a fungal

21:58.238 --> 22:07.117
disease that clocks up the water uptake system of 
the tree, very simply. And we lost some trees to

22:07.398 --> 22:18.762
that, but where we protected them and worked with 
them, we found that we could keep up the health and

22:07.398 --> 22:18.762
that wasn't quite the problem. that the oak wilt 
is. Oak wilt's a different cat. It's a fairly fast

22:23.795 --> 22:30.203
acting tree and it will affect the red oaks and the 
live oaks. It affects a broader spectrum of trees.

22:34.469 --> 22:47.365
The live oak decline will also spread by root 
grounds but the oak decline, or oak wilt I mean, it

22:34.469 --> 22:47.365
spreads by by root grafts and by an insect vector. 
Well, the client will spread by an insect vector

22:52.346 --> 23:04.088
too because it's a fungus, but the oak wilt is much 
more easily moved It's more contagious, I guess

23:05.317 --> 23:07.520
you might say. Why do we appear to have it more on the 
campus than all throughout the community? I don't

23:12.425 --> 23:12.846
know. It may have some play that the trees are a 
little weaker because of compaction, building,

23:13.346 --> 23:24.939
sidewalks, that kind of thing. And there's any 
number of things that can add up. to those kind of

23:28.385 --> 23:29.626
problems. But we've got, what, 43 or so thousand 
people using the campus. And that creates a

23:36.072 --> 23:41.958
problem. And I've assumed that as we put in new 
sidewalks, wider walkways, deeper curbs,

23:41.978 --> 23:57.632
gutters, and streets, somebody spills some water 
or they wash out a truck or something or other, all

23:41.978 --> 23:57.632
of that Mm-hmm. Yeah, we used to try to designate,

23:58.979 --> 24:13.231
even going back to the street projects, we had 
designated places where the concrete trucks

23:58.979 --> 24:13.231
could wash out so they could be cleaned up, this 
kind of thing. And I think that helped. We had, I

24:18.676 --> 24:22.579
think, a good inspector that he and I got along very 
good. We had a good rapport. And he understood the

24:23.740 --> 24:28.564
need for that.

24:29.860 --> 24:41.774
But given where we're located as an institution 
and a community, what are the special realities

24:29.860 --> 24:41.774
that a landscaper has to cope with on that campus? 
Oh, we've got a problem with soil and water. Um,

24:46.899 --> 24:53.227
the, um, I think the general soil type is called, 
um, a Lufkin fine sand. It's, it's a very,

24:56.050 --> 25:12.635
Compactable material and It if it gets wet and gets 
any kind of compaction on it's it's the dickens to

24:56.050 --> 25:12.635
relieve Makes it very difficult for tree roots 
particularly to grow. The other thing is our

25:13.316 --> 25:14.618
water. It's Has a lot of a lot of sodium and 
bicarbonates particularly sodium and And that

25:22.966 --> 25:40.855
just compounds the compaction problem, because 
what you do, you tend to increase your pH, go more to

25:22.966 --> 25:40.855
the alkaline side, and that tends to what we call 
deflocculate the soil, which takes out all the air

25:22.966 --> 25:40.855
spaces, basically, is what it does. And that 
creates another problem. And that's the reason

25:45.743 --> 25:50.290
why we'll go into a drought period like we have now, 
And then we'll start getting some real frog

25:50.810 --> 25:54.996
stranglers, hopefully. And that tends to leach 
out not all the sodium, but a lot of the sodium in the

25:55.717 --> 26:02.948
bicarbonates and gets it out of the root zone. And 
you start seeing things green up. And that's one of

26:06.593 --> 26:08.015
the reasons. I mean, we can keep it alive. with the 
with our water but ultimately if you had we had the

26:10.840 --> 26:40.392
water totally and we didn't get any rainfall we'd 
start seeing a lot of degeneration of almost all

26:10.840 --> 26:40.392
kinds of vegetation because the just water our 
soil our water has in it now uh relatively good

26:10.840 --> 26:40.392
drainage very good drainage is needed um are there 
some other trees that in hindsight we might have

26:10.840 --> 26:40.392
added that would have been a blessing been a 
positive to the oak? Well, we have two or three

26:44.165 --> 26:47.495
elms. The cedar elm, which is a native tree, is a 
very good tree. A little leaf elm or an evergreen

26:52.048 --> 26:55.478
elm. depending on where you are and what part of the 
country you're from, is a good one. The Chinese

27:01.577 --> 27:06.101
pistachio tree I think is an excellent tree. It's 
one of the few trees that makes a good fairly fast

27:06.282 --> 27:14.609
growing tree and has fall color here, which we 
desperately need. The ball cypress is a good tree.

27:20.055 --> 27:22.697
It takes a little establishment But we used a 
number of those in like the chemistry mall central

27:22.677 --> 27:32.345
campus area. And those things are up now probably 
25, 30 feet tall and have done very well. But they

27:40.593 --> 27:41.894
make a good upland tree. Once you get them 
established, you've got to really, really water

27:41.994 --> 27:47.118
them for two or three years. Because if they ever 
brown, being a conifer, they're the odds of them

27:52.698 --> 27:56.705
coming back are very poor. But they do make a good 
upland tree once you get them established.

28:03.838 --> 28:16.360
In that centennial year,

28:03.838 --> 28:16.360
were you aware of Dr. Williams' health decline? I 
think I had heard some rumors, you know, that he was

28:16.981 --> 28:25.678
not feeling well, but I didn't see him all that 
much. I mean, I'll tell you, we were so busy back in

28:26.399 --> 28:33.994
those days that I went went to Tom Cherry's staff 
meetings and any plan reviews and General

28:35.189 --> 28:51.984
Ludeke's meeting, and that's about all I did, 
unless there was some specific request, because

28:35.189 --> 28:51.984
we were just trying to keep our heads above water, 
you know, to keep the campus maintained with

28:35.189 --> 28:51.984
everything being so disrupted. And Dr. Williams 
going to the hospital and being there a good while

28:53.365 --> 29:03.694
didn't have any effect on General Ludeke. took 
over as the interim during that time. Was there any

29:07.834 --> 29:09.375
change from your? Never saw anything. The

29:12.799 --> 29:25.393
only thing we had a change after Tom Cherry 
retired, and I reported to Clyde Freeman for a

29:12.799 --> 29:25.393
year. That was different. We seemed to get along 
OK. But he was a lot more demanding than Tom Cherry

29:33.138 --> 29:43.334
about specifics, on justifications. Instead of a 
two or three word paragraph, I had to write two or

29:43.534 --> 29:49.583
three paragraphs, that kind of thing. And I never 
will forget, Tom Cherry came by to visit me one day

29:49.603 --> 29:56.894
after he retired. And I was needing a large motor 
grader. because we had two of them at the time. And

30:04.862 --> 30:07.525
the larger one had just completely worn out. And I 
said, you know, I'm having to write a thesis on the

30:08.126 --> 30:13.472
justification. They said, I told you you should 
have bought the damn thing when I was here. But

30:17.517 --> 30:25.487
other than that, we didn't have that much problem, 
really. And then reported to Freeman for about how

30:25.687 --> 30:27.909
long? For about a year. And then who? And then 
Howard Vestal. became the VP. Howard took over

30:33.810 --> 30:36.613
after Mr. Cherry. Describe him and his management 
style. Howard was a different type of manager.

30:49.528 --> 30:52.351
We got along very good. We had a very good working 
relationship.

30:58.424 --> 31:08.616
Um, it's kind of hard to peg the real difference, 
but he was, had a little more casual, uh, mode about

30:58.424 --> 31:08.616
him. And I would go up to him, you know, I'd have an 
idea about something and go up to him and it's, Hey,

31:09.697 --> 31:15.744
that's what I'm hiring you for. Do it, you know? And 
that's kind of the way we operated. I always had,

31:21.090 --> 31:23.132
um, Anytime I need to see him, I could get in and see 
him, as well as Mr. Cherry. I could call up and say, I

31:26.818 --> 31:31.133
need to talk. And they'd say, come on up.
