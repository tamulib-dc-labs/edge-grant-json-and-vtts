00:02.883 --> 00:06.229
You said you tried to be with your people as much as possible.

00:06.449 --> 00:07.431
Right.

00:08.272 --> 00:11.978
To me, that was kind of the fun part.

00:11.998 --> 00:14.562
I had lots of graduate students about.

00:15.424 --> 00:23.457
I just tried to see people as much as I could and figured my paperwork and lots of that I just had to do at night.

00:23.437 --> 00:24.920
at other times.

00:25.040 --> 00:35.357
And you were always having either university accreditation or college accreditation or departmental accreditation or graduate program accreditation.

00:36.139 --> 00:40.426
There was something always having to be prepared.

00:41.308 --> 00:43.251
And normally you got home about what time?

00:43.636 --> 00:56.818
Oh, I normally tried to get home by, now early on when I was having to prepare my lessons and all that, I couldn't get home until very late, you know.

00:57.980 --> 01:04.172
And, but later on in life, I tried to get home by 6 o'clock or so.

01:04.213 --> 01:08.140
And what, during all those years, what did you do for relaxation?

01:09.643 --> 01:16.377
Oh, frankly, I, I, I, um,

01:18.196 --> 01:21.305
I didn't do very much.

01:21.325 --> 01:31.613
I always enjoyed quail hunting when I could, but I spent the time with my kids primarily.

01:31.633 --> 01:34.180
I coached Little League.

01:34.160 --> 01:47.063
teenage baseball and all that kind of stuff and had horses for my children and took them to horse shows and so it was a long day.

01:47.123 --> 01:50.228
And you're active in what church?

01:50.208 --> 01:53.735
A&M Church of Christ.

01:53.896 --> 02:02.273
I was a deacon there and chaired that building committee that built a new facility in and out by Consolidated High School.

02:02.313 --> 02:07.103
Did all those little things on the side.

02:07.083 --> 02:09.446
Let's go back to Mr. Rudder.

02:11.048 --> 02:15.593
Did you see much, as a department head, did you see much of Mr. Rudder?

02:15.833 --> 02:17.936
Did he come over to the vet school very often?

02:17.956 --> 02:31.352
No, I never saw Mr. Rudder in the veterinary school, but as I say, we had academic council, and I guess we met probably once a month unless we had special meetings.

02:31.332 --> 02:33.515
And he was always there.

02:34.617 --> 02:41.748
And if we had receptions or new student nights or what have you, Mr. Rudder knew every one of the faculty on campus.

02:41.909 --> 02:49.240
And so... What did Mr. Rudder do best and least best?

02:49.220 --> 02:56.487
Mr. Rudder, as I mentioned before, at least best, I guess, was delegation.

02:57.428 --> 03:17.488
And best was knowing the faculty and the faculty respecting him, the changes that he made in the university structure from the standpoint of coeducation and the military aspects of it.

03:17.468 --> 03:20.212
name changes and all those kind of things.

03:20.312 --> 03:44.910
And then his relationship with the legislative people and, like I say, he was a good friend of Abner McCall and friends and network he had developed through the state and even at the national level.

03:44.890 --> 03:54.411
He just did a little, at any level, he was very effective.

03:54.914 --> 04:01.584
I say just when, I was pretty involved with when he got, had his heart attack.

04:01.945 --> 04:02.666
Describe that.

04:03.487 --> 04:18.610
Well, it, again, it goes back to my relationship to Baylor probably meant more to my career than, than anything.

04:18.590 --> 04:40.632
The contacts I made in the medical center, anytime anybody at A&M needs a referral or what have you, I could just call and get admission in the medical center at any of the hospitals and still can.

04:40.612 --> 04:57.326
But there was a man in the medical center, Dr. John Knox, who was head of the dermatology department and really helped me and took care of me while I was down at Baylor.

05:00.549 --> 05:05.733
Immediately when Mr. Rudder had the attack, John took over and got him admitted.

05:06.974 --> 05:10.197
How did you and others learn about the attack?

05:10.852 --> 05:13.455
Oh, I guess John called me.

05:14.456 --> 05:16.238
Was Mr. Rudder at home?

05:16.258 --> 05:19.221
I think so, best I remember.

05:19.982 --> 05:25.748
And, but John, John just took over that whole, that whole bit.

05:26.188 --> 05:40.183
John Knox was a, as you know, was a very A&M oriented Aggie, played basketball here, and one of the

05:40.450 --> 06:03.707
outstanding former students, and it wasn't anything that he wouldn't do for Texas A&M University, and so John was very, very important in all of that event, and I'd get daily reports from him on his status,

06:03.687 --> 06:09.687
Were you surprised when Mr. Rudder had his heart attack?

06:10.028 --> 06:11.352
Were you aware of his...

06:12.007 --> 06:19.455
No, and John wasn't either that he had been having, had any cardiac problems.

06:19.475 --> 06:22.979
He was a bit overweight and overworked.

06:22.999 --> 06:27.144
So, I mean, those things led their way.

06:29.967 --> 06:34.892
Part I know Mr. Rudder didn't smoke or anything.

06:34.872 --> 06:44.203
just a bit overweight, and I don't know what his family heritage was as far as hard time.

06:44.924 --> 06:54.896
Then, when Dr. Williams came, did you know, had you had any acquaintance with him before he was appointed as president?

06:55.216 --> 07:02.905
No, but he came, and the reason that, I don't know, he ain't,

07:03.982 --> 07:07.548
Jack Kenny was a strange, it was not strange to be different.

07:08.149 --> 07:11.574
He always called me Brother McCready, and I don't know why.

07:14.359 --> 07:25.737
But he came out of Tennessee and had headed up, I believe it was Tennessee, and headed up the medical program in Tennessee.

07:25.717 --> 07:30.721
He was the chief academic officer of all the, including, and particularly medicine also.

07:30.741 --> 07:31.002
Right.

07:31.582 --> 07:41.951
And so that, when he came here, he always seemed to have this interest in medicine with some knowledge and background.

07:41.971 --> 07:54.542
And so, again, it always, anything to do with medicine at that time, since we didn't have a medical school, and particularly the Texas Medical Center was kind of my

07:55.805 --> 07:56.413
task.

07:58.035 --> 07:59.048
For example

08:01.154 --> 08:23.347
A long later in life, after we had the Institute of Comparative Medicine and set that up, and then I was called on by the chancellor, Perry Atkinson, to set up an institute of biomedical sciences and technology in the Texas Medical Center.

08:24.589 --> 08:30.958
And Dr. Winerti had since become president of the Texas Medical Center.

08:30.938 --> 08:50.805
So I was asked to design a building and a program for the IBT using the old Shamrock Hilton site, tearing it down and building a new 11-story building.

08:50.825 --> 09:00.878
So I was asked to, I was asked by the chancellor to put together a program and design a building.

09:01.634 --> 09:04.058
for that site, which I did.

09:05.740 --> 09:16.617
And I still have all the plans, I still have all the program materials, the design of the projects, the whole thing.

09:16.637 --> 09:25.431
The Chancellor at that time, I had several opportunities to move elsewhere.

09:27.638 --> 09:40.635
who've become dean, and the chancellor asked me if I would to stay at Texas A&M to help him put in this institute of comparative, oh, this Bowles Institute, IBT.

09:40.975 --> 09:43.679
Which A&M leader was that?

09:44.360 --> 09:45.301
That was Perry.

09:45.321 --> 09:45.641
Perry.

09:47.244 --> 09:54.473
And Perry was, this is, I don't mean to be derogatory about any of this, but

09:55.195 --> 10:00.348
He called me, had me meet him in his office one morning at six o'clock.

10:01.912 --> 10:12.698
He said, J.D., he said, if I'm going to become chancellor of the A&M system, I have been charged by

10:13.353 --> 10:25.381
David Eller, Chairman of the Board of Regents, that I must put together this relationship with the Baylor College or the Texas Medical Center.

10:27.226 --> 10:29.050
He said,

10:30.413 --> 10:41.408
I don't know how to begin, and he said that my assistant associate chancellor, O.D.

10:41.448 --> 10:49.760
Butler, said that you are the one that has the contact in the medical center.

10:50.741 --> 10:51.902
He said, well, you do it.

10:52.904 --> 10:59.593
I said, well, at that time I just had an offer from, to become dean at Oklahoma State.

11:00.198 --> 11:05.110
And he had been called about all the deanships I would be contacted.

11:05.171 --> 11:14.494
They would always call the administrative officers, officers here to see, I guess, for reference and other things.

11:15.082 --> 11:20.291
And he said, I know you got the job offer at that time at Oklahoma State.

11:20.411 --> 11:31.390
And he said, if you'll stay here and help me put this together, I'm going to make you dean of the College of Veterinary Medicine, and I'm going to have you run this institute.

11:33.113 --> 11:40.465
And you can interview Perry and verify these facts if you so desire.

11:40.445 --> 11:46.814
And so I said, well, I really liked the medical center.

11:47.094 --> 11:55.766
I would really enjoy having the college and that institute to go with it.

11:56.967 --> 12:01.153
And at the same time, I had

12:01.133 --> 12:02.815
So I developed the institute.

12:02.876 --> 12:12.810
I got Dr. Bill Butler, president of Baylor, and Dr. LaMater, president of MD Anderson, involved in the process.

12:14.232 --> 12:27.732
I was offered fifty million dollars by Dr. LaMater to set up a separate entity called Institute for Comparative Oncology.

12:29.045 --> 12:41.271
And that would have been, Dr. LaMater had said that, you know, these rats and mice we're using for cancer research have proved nothing in 100 years.

12:41.331 --> 12:49.348
He said we need a spontaneous heterogenic source of cancer for experimentation.

12:49.565 --> 12:52.529
and in animals large enough that we can do therapy.

12:53.491 --> 13:00.220
So 50 million dollars was mine to set that up.

13:00.241 --> 13:12.298
So we had the Institute of All Sciences and Technology Institute for Comparative Oncology, the medical school, all of those great things going.

13:13.831 --> 13:26.077
assignment verbally assigned to me to take over in about 1989 or something like that.

13:26.097 --> 13:31.148
And overnight, all of that was changed.

13:32.208 --> 13:41.299
decided that they wanted to hire a member of the National Academy of Sciences to head up the College of Agriculture.

13:43.701 --> 13:55.515
And when they hired that gentleman, one of the stipulations in his contract was that he would have his own animal doctors.

13:55.985 --> 13:59.112
and would hire the dean of the College of Veterinary Medicine.

14:00.735 --> 14:03.502
And so that destroyed the whole system.

14:03.882 --> 14:08.472
As far as you know, you say they, was that a board, was that a Regental decision?

14:10.597 --> 14:15.107
That decision was built, again, a lot around Perry.

14:17.382 --> 14:30.212
and Perry had been appointed to the National Academy of Sciences, and they began to think that if you're gonna hire anybody in any job here from then on, there's gonna be a National Academy member.

14:30.232 --> 14:35.965
But I was meaning, did the people that decided that, was it Perry or was it people above Perry?

14:35.945 --> 14:42.098
Well, I think it was a combination of David Eller and Perry.

14:43.180 --> 14:51.979
Because David was working with me directly on setting up another institute out here, which I did on

14:51.959 --> 14:54.543
exotic animals and wildlife.

14:55.525 --> 14:59.691
He had an interest in that because of some of his contacts in Africa.

15:00.372 --> 15:15.256
So I was working with David on that, and with Perry on this other, and with La Mater and Butler on another, and things were really going great guns, you know.

15:15.296 --> 15:18.541
Now were you, were you still department head at that point?

15:18.621 --> 15:19.703
Yeah.

15:19.723 --> 15:19.823
Okay.

15:20.292 --> 15:40.537
I was told I was going to be promoted and to be responsible for the Institute of Bioscience and Technology, the College of Veterinary Medicine, the Institute for Comparative Oncology, and the Wildlife and Exotic Animal Program.

15:40.958 --> 15:42.620
And that changed overnight.

15:43.361 --> 15:50.029
And I was essentially banished to Siberia, actually.

15:50.870 --> 15:53.616
How did you learn of those changes?

15:55.059 --> 16:00.432
Well, it was strange.

16:02.135 --> 16:05.082
They hired this gentleman.

16:06.732 --> 16:12.941
And he came as head of the College of Agriculture and Experiment Station.

16:13.743 --> 16:24.339
They kicked Neville Clark aside when they brought him here, Dr. Arntzen.

16:24.359 --> 16:28.605
And Dr. Arntzen appeared with the idea of me helping him.

16:29.581 --> 16:33.266
learn about the College of Veterinary Medicine.

16:33.887 --> 16:36.071
He always called them his animal people.

16:37.172 --> 16:39.996
He didn't call them veterinarians.

16:40.077 --> 16:45.244
He had met this dean they brought in, the dean of veterinary medicine.

16:45.264 --> 16:59.385
He had met him while he was at the University of Illinois working there, and so I had been selected as dean, and when they brought in about our faculty here,

17:00.209 --> 17:14.329
Then they brought this other gentleman in just overnight, and he appeared, and the faculty signed a petition, 87 percent of the faculty, to appoint me as dean.

17:15.290 --> 17:25.204
And so when the other gentleman came, he stayed here six, seven years old, but he never, he was never able to gain the confidence of the faculty.

17:25.184 --> 17:27.167
Let's back up to another dean search.

17:28.409 --> 17:34.099
Dr. Price served to the normal retirement age and retired.

17:35.461 --> 17:46.720
And looking back on his years of service, how would you describe, how would you summarize, describe Al Price's record here?

17:46.852 --> 17:52.523
Well, as I mentioned, Al had, he was still primarily an educator.

17:52.643 --> 18:01.941
He wasn't really into the research and graduate efforts, but he had this vision of doubling the enrollment.

18:01.921 --> 18:09.932
and the trimester program, which he got from Bill Armstead at Michigan State.

18:10.012 --> 18:21.448
But he, that all came together at the time of capitation, and so we got new buildings, we got new curriculum, more students.

18:21.428 --> 18:34.063
All of those things were good, but we were still very embryonic as far as being a total college.

18:34.704 --> 18:40.671
All right, then he retired and there was a search and led to the appointment of George Shelton.

18:40.691 --> 18:42.373
Describe that search as you recall.

18:42.734 --> 18:45.597
Well, before the search occurred,

18:45.948 --> 18:47.891
Dr. John Calhoun.

18:48.612 --> 18:51.597
We weren't into big searches back in those times.

18:52.438 --> 18:54.161
I would laugh every now and then.

18:54.181 --> 18:57.045
I hired my whole faculty without any search.

18:58.527 --> 19:08.783
I mean, I'd bring them in and let them meet and so forth, but I'd been recruiting these people for years through this other system.

19:08.763 --> 19:10.925
But we didn't really do much searching.

19:10.945 --> 19:20.713
And Dr. Calhoun called me one day to come visit him, and he offered me the deanship.

19:22.234 --> 19:34.424
And I was, that would have been in, I was about 35, 40 years old or something like that.

19:34.444 --> 19:38.668
And I, you know, and I told him I appreciated it very much.

19:40.707 --> 19:50.204
But I had a family and, you know, that I just felt like I wasn't ready.

19:50.284 --> 19:59.600
I said, when I get to be dean, I want to be able to immerse myself essentially 24 hours a day and build a program.

20:01.684 --> 20:05.230
And it kind of took him aback a little bit.

20:06.307 --> 20:09.151
And I don't know whether you talked to them at that time or not.

20:10.373 --> 20:16.202
But... So anyhow, then they went into a search mode.

20:17.183 --> 20:20.749
I was the chairman of that search committee.

20:20.829 --> 20:23.873
I was the one that conducted the search.

20:24.414 --> 20:30.323
So describe how you and your colleagues... Well, we...

20:32.243 --> 20:37.931
We were not very familiar with searches.

20:37.951 --> 20:42.358
Al Price had been, all the other deans had just been appointed by the administration.

20:42.418 --> 20:47.646
And just like I was appointed department head, there was never a search or anything done.

20:47.806 --> 20:52.513
And I guess I would have been appointed dean without a search if,

20:52.493 --> 20:55.657
if I would have accepted it.

20:56.679 --> 21:08.195
But we went through a process with, when you look at, for deans of colleges, you don't have many people, you don't have many people to select from.

21:09.357 --> 21:13.202
And so I think that

21:13.182 --> 21:21.918
George Shelton was, he was an A&M graduate.

21:22.219 --> 21:23.261
He was a veterinarian.

21:25.405 --> 21:27.789
He had his Ph.D.

21:28.591 --> 21:32.839
He, let's say, that's the first team we ever had to have a Ph.D.

21:34.442 --> 21:35.764
And

21:35.744 --> 21:48.151
And he was congenial and didn't appear that he would rock the boat in any way, and said it appeared to be rather low-key.

21:49.253 --> 21:55.086
And that's the way it turned out to be, a very much of a gentleman, a person that came in.

21:55.066 --> 22:02.436
turned all the funds over and all the decisions over to the department heads.

22:02.456 --> 22:10.947
And the only time you needed to go see Dr. Shelton was if you needed some resources or some help.

22:11.688 --> 22:16.534
He never interfered in any way with whatever you were doing.

22:17.003 --> 22:25.193
As far as you would now look back, did he lead the college effectively?

22:26.414 --> 22:33.303
Well, you know, and George will tell you the same thing.

22:34.464 --> 22:39.450
He selected good department heads.

22:40.527 --> 22:52.641
and let them do their thing, and only got involved if you needed some type of assistance, and he was always available.

22:52.661 --> 23:05.596
If I needed to go and visit someone about a grant or about some type of activity, he immediately would go with you and visit with them and support you.

23:05.936 --> 23:07.598
I never had a time when

23:07.578 --> 23:16.869
The only time that George and I ever had any conflict in objectives was when he decided to go line item.

23:17.410 --> 23:17.770
Go what?

23:18.071 --> 23:19.793
Line item budget.

23:19.813 --> 23:36.353
And I, having been in a department that had such a big graduate program and a big biomedical sciences program, didn't think that we would get a fair shake in line item.

23:38.088 --> 23:52.570
And what I wanted to do, I wanted to go in with a hybrid proposal to the legislature, line item for the professional program, just like the medical school, but stay on formula for graduate program and biomedical sciences program.

23:53.208 --> 23:55.392
Well, anyhow, we went line out.

23:56.774 --> 24:12.359
And as time went by, we found out we got it changed two years ago that we weren't getting credit for Biomedical Sciences, which is a huge program, or for our graduate program.

24:13.141 --> 24:18.169
And so when Dr. Adams became dean, the first thing he did was

24:18.149 --> 24:38.571
consulted and I tried to explain to him formally how you got so much per head and you don't get that on Lion Atom and so now we've gone back to the legislature and we have two funding sources, one for Lion Atom for the professional program and one formula for all the other programs.

24:39.192 --> 24:47.973
How, was there any difference in the pattern of department heads meetings with Dean Shelton than there was with Dean Price?

24:50.018 --> 24:51.902
Oh.

24:52.962 --> 25:01.175
I guess Al came with a little bit more of a fixed agenda than George.

25:01.856 --> 25:06.003
George, he's just such a principled person.

25:06.564 --> 25:10.871
He wasn't anything but to help.

25:11.532 --> 25:14.937
As they've often said, you know, he was too nice to be a dean.

25:14.917 --> 25:19.662
But the college made great strides because he left the Department.

25:19.682 --> 25:21.103
He had to run with it.

25:21.464 --> 25:22.945
What about his life?

25:23.425 --> 25:24.226
Describe Joy.

25:24.867 --> 25:30.272
Oh, Joy is just a real trooper.

25:30.993 --> 25:37.059
She, of course, I had a kind of an unusual relationship with them in a way.

25:37.940 --> 25:42.004
George hadn't been here too very long and he had a

25:41.984 --> 25:58.002
an acoustical tumor, a brain tumor, and he wanted to know what to do and this and that, and so I got him and sent him to a doctor that I had

25:57.982 --> 26:17.087
done research with at Baylor, and Dr. Bobby Alford, who was an ENT man and surgeon, and those acoustical tumors normally take 24 hours of surgery and working in teams to dissect them out and so forth.

26:17.067 --> 26:24.005
And so I got him an appointment with Dr. Alford, and Dr. Alford's team did that surgery.

26:24.105 --> 26:30.261
And as I say, I had a good rapport with all of these people.

26:30.301 --> 26:32.848
Dr. Alford and I were very close.

26:32.828 --> 26:38.959
He, an M.D., and I working on graduate, on a research program.

26:39.099 --> 26:48.938
In fact, I had a dog that had a, had a past pointing condition.

26:49.218 --> 26:54.668
It had an overly active middle ear.

26:54.648 --> 27:12.084
activity and infection and, and would circle and pass point or go past the desired point and we took it in the Methodist Hospital and operated on it to the Bluebird Clinic about years ago and so.

27:12.865 --> 27:22.174
Anyhow, we just had, we had a good relationship and a good family relationship and I had a good, with George we had some common friends and

27:22.306 --> 27:28.428
And I was able to help make contact with some prominent people in the state.

27:28.668 --> 27:33.987
And so our relationship was just always great, and we set up

27:35.435 --> 27:46.151
He and Ed Eddett and I set up this companion animal center, geriatric center, and that's another story.

27:46.572 --> 27:58.590
All right, now at the state level, I understood at the time that the search began for Dr. Shelton,

27:58.857 --> 28:13.927
that there was a little bit of complaining across the state about the College of Veterinary Medicine losing touch with the real state and all, that there needed to be stronger rapport with the public out there.

28:14.087 --> 28:15.550
Was that?

28:15.530 --> 28:20.820
Well, you mean after George was appointed or before he was appointed?

28:20.880 --> 28:22.322
Before he was appointed.

28:23.044 --> 28:29.956
Well, yeah, I guess in some ways Al had a good rapport with the graduates.

28:30.156 --> 28:31.619
Yes.

28:32.140 --> 28:38.331
But I don't know that he ever built very much a relationship with the legislative people.

28:38.851 --> 28:53.910
And that's a difficult, at the time, if you're not on line item, depending who the president is, they don't let the deans get out and try to get state support or anything.

28:53.950 --> 28:57.774
So, you know, it all depends.

28:57.815 --> 29:02.260
But George, we, when George came, one of the other things that Ned

29:02.240 --> 29:20.047
was we set up kind of a development, college development program where we tried to influence, bring friends of veterinary medicine in from around the state and develop that.

29:20.147 --> 29:21.589
And George was good at that.

29:21.689 --> 29:24.734
He had done that.

29:24.854 --> 29:27.018
We made lots of friends through that.

29:27.398 --> 29:30.002
Now at the higher level,

29:30.742 --> 29:34.150
he worked, the college worked well with Calhoun and Williams.

29:34.210 --> 29:34.671
Is that right?

29:34.691 --> 29:37.397
It seemed to me that they did.

29:37.437 --> 29:45.696
Then when Dr. Williams has his heart attack, then when he recovers,

29:46.115 --> 29:51.060
the board recreates the system and moves him up to be chancellor.

29:51.080 --> 29:51.520
And Miller.

29:53.983 --> 29:56.686
How did things change, or did they change then?

29:57.426 --> 30:04.974
Well, again, I don't want to be derogatory toward anybody, but I guess did Jarvis come in after that?

30:06.275 --> 30:14.063
And OD, animal science people, they always thought that the college belonged to them.

30:16.000 --> 30:18.404
And they were very jealous of the college.

30:20.488 --> 30:25.337
And really didn't do a lot to try to help the college.

30:25.377 --> 30:35.275
And I had become real involved in the Texas Aircraft Experiment Station.

30:36.233 --> 30:39.739
after Neville became director, Neville Clark.

30:41.522 --> 30:55.727
And so I was kind of pulled into that thing, that arena of the agriculture and the experiment station and lots of those things.

30:55.707 --> 31:01.483
through an undertow with Neville, who was a veterinary Ph.D.

31:01.543 --> 31:02.686
physiologist.

31:02.846 --> 31:06.275
He trained at Washington State, so we were very good friends.

31:06.396 --> 31:10.948
He was in my department on paper.

31:12.278 --> 31:16.525
As I look back on it, it probably wasn't fair, but George never complained.

31:17.266 --> 31:30.287
I probably handled nearly all of the research dollars and the grants and contracts and everything up through the experiment station and the university.
