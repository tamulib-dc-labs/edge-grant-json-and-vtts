WEBVTT

00:02.393 --> 00:07.119
And in those two countries, the students didn't go out where the problem was.

00:08.440 --> 00:18.593
They were frightened by the magnitude and complexities of the problem, and they were trained very narrowly, excellent scientists.

00:18.613 --> 00:21.156
Nobody knew how to put the pieces together.

00:21.176 --> 00:31.388
The result was that they stayed in their laboratories and continued to do all too often what they had done for their doctorate thesis, had no relevance or virtually none.

00:31.705 --> 00:34.788
to the needs of the agriculture and food production.

00:35.969 --> 00:38.412
And so we were aware of this.

00:39.213 --> 00:44.699
And this was why I insisted, if we were going to do anything, to be helpful.

00:44.719 --> 00:53.708
After we had finished the job in Mexico, bring those students fresh out of school, not the ones that are up at the top of the pack.

00:53.748 --> 00:54.589
You can't change them.

00:55.730 --> 00:58.093
A few of them you can, but by and large you can.

00:58.613 --> 01:00.295
The young ones were still

01:00.730 --> 01:19.407
young and receptive to train beside us to make the connection between the brain work, the theoretical knowledge they got during their college days in their home country, which is almost entirely theoretical since most of them have had no practical training on the land.

01:21.049 --> 01:27.835
Let them work beside us and our approach was also never locked off into little compartments.

01:28.321 --> 01:39.216
It wasn't highly specialized plant breeders who didn't concern themselves about soil fertility and agronomic practice and control of insects and diseases and quality.

01:39.977 --> 01:47.126
I was concerned about all of those, and probably I had to be because of the way our staff unfolded.

01:48.207 --> 01:50.110
Dr. Bill Caldwell was

01:50.849 --> 01:55.938
there before I got there on soils and agronomy, but he left a few months after I was there.

01:56.279 --> 02:10.224
I had the good fortune of working with him and putting through, putting in and harvesting a few of the first corn fertilizer tests and the first wheat fertilizer test, planting them.

02:10.725 --> 02:12.448
I harvested them.

02:12.468 --> 02:13.009
He left.

02:14.390 --> 02:40.802
and then we got a new soil scientist and he stayed a very short period of time and so there was in the first seven years there were about four or five changeovers of the agronomist soil scientists and i knew that we had to have this as part of the total production factor and so when they when we didn't have someone why i said all right we'll do it those of us under the breeding and plant pathology program and so we went ahead the best we could and

02:41.153 --> 02:51.926
By the time we finally got a soil scientist that stayed, he was flabbergasted how much we knew that the soil scientist hadn't provided us with.

02:52.727 --> 03:04.181
And he said at one of the first field days when he saw how much we knew and what an impact we'd had with farmers in the handling of soil fertility, fertilizers, and rotation, he says, I'll make you a promise.

03:04.261 --> 03:05.964
It's a disaster the way it's been.

03:07.666 --> 03:09.608
But from now on in,

03:10.465 --> 03:17.352
I promise you that I'll open and cut through the brush ahead of you so that you won't have to do this again.

03:17.372 --> 03:24.360
But I learned to do it and it served me very well in all of the other countries where I have to go on through the same brush.

03:26.843 --> 03:30.006
It was the best thing that could happen to me as an individual.

03:30.206 --> 03:31.528
Because it broadened you.

03:31.548 --> 03:32.309
The whole thing.

03:34.271 --> 03:39.156
So you had, in other words, what you're saying, you had to carry the whole project

03:41.600 --> 03:44.524
from the beginning until completion?

03:45.185 --> 03:51.333
Including, I had no training whatsoever in wheat quality, milling making, but I had to learn.

03:52.394 --> 04:00.305
And since I had to deal with economic policy makers, I had to learn to talk their vernacular also.

04:00.785 --> 04:10.358
So I'd have to read economics books and I'd have to read the serial chemistry books and when I'd visit Minneapolis I'd go over to General Mills or

04:11.063 --> 04:14.147
to the wheat quality laboratories.

04:15.709 --> 04:17.932
This was fortunate for me.

04:18.053 --> 04:20.376
I took the extra time to do this.

04:20.816 --> 04:31.411
In the corn program, they had four turnovers, not just in the soil fertility, but in the breeders in about the first six or seven years.

04:31.931 --> 04:36.678
The result was that no one ever put the pieces together in the same morning.

04:36.698 --> 04:38.961
Not because of me, but I had the continuity.

04:39.413 --> 04:40.314
You follow what I mean?

04:40.334 --> 04:40.594
Yes.

04:40.614 --> 04:55.011
And I insisted that all of the people, no matter, they might be more interested in one aspect on, let's say, the breeding, or the plant mythology, or serial technology, or cultural practice.

04:55.071 --> 05:03.921
But, by gosh, they needed to know something about everything, and I insisted on this with those who stayed at that Siyano in the summertime.

05:04.021 --> 05:05.502
Some of them stayed there.

05:05.522 --> 05:06.163
I said, look,

05:08.168 --> 05:14.275
And also, I used to tell the other people who were coming in from, some of them were specialists in soils.

05:14.515 --> 05:23.866
I would say to them in the early years, look, when a farmer comes in here to ask about wheat, you're supposed to know all about wheat more than anybody else.

05:24.687 --> 05:33.417
But you better darn well learn to know more than anybody else about cotton, because we don't have a cotton specialist at the present time.

05:34.460 --> 05:40.307
Because when that farmer finishes asking you the question, what variety shall I plant of wheat?

05:40.327 --> 05:41.528
What date shall I plant it?

05:42.009 --> 05:43.571
What fertilizer shall I put on?

05:43.811 --> 05:46.234
How many irrigations shall I give it?

05:46.815 --> 05:48.236
What about controlling the weeds?

05:48.296 --> 05:50.940
And if there's aphids, how do I control them?

05:52.722 --> 05:57.587
You'll know that because of the kind of training you've had.

05:57.607 --> 06:02.273
But when he turns to you and he says, now what cotton varieties should I plant?

06:03.350 --> 06:04.511
And when should I plant them?

06:05.192 --> 06:09.117
And how many irrigations do I need to give?

06:09.638 --> 06:13.943
What are my insect problems likely to be, and what do I do about them?

06:13.963 --> 06:19.229
I said, you better know more about it than he does, than most of them will.

06:19.249 --> 06:27.940
And the only way to do that, since we haven't had time to train you broadly, and I don't even know this, but you're going to be here the whole year round,

06:28.578 --> 06:35.247
You better watch what's going on on the fields of the best cotton farmer.

06:36.148 --> 06:39.893
You travel the whole valley in your spare time.

06:40.574 --> 06:42.397
You see how he does it.

06:42.417 --> 06:44.579
You ask questions, and then you get in the library.

06:44.660 --> 06:54.433
You find the book and read all the theoretical background you can on it, and you're broadening yourself, and you do it for the other major crops.

06:54.453 --> 06:57.657
You can't do it for everything but the ones that are important.

06:58.244 --> 07:00.588
And that philosophy prevailed for a long time.

07:02.110 --> 07:04.674
You lose it, but you don't lose it.

07:04.754 --> 07:08.559
But the new generation doesn't know that this went on.

07:08.620 --> 07:19.836
And then if you don't have somebody up here and the more experienced that puts these threads all together, you lose the package effect.

07:19.856 --> 07:25.585
I did a lot of oral history interviews in Indiana with county agents.

07:26.138 --> 07:33.989
And what you're describing to me sounds remarkably similar to what a county agent across the United States would be doing.

07:34.249 --> 07:39.456
Could you make some similarities and differences for me?

07:39.476 --> 07:42.240
The main difference is that we did the research too.

07:42.360 --> 07:51.673
We were doing the whole basic breeding work, the plant pathology work on the diseases, the soil

07:52.953 --> 07:58.460
When fertilizer didn't work, what was wrong, why, what was involved.

07:58.660 --> 08:10.255
Same way on milling and baking, you'd have to try to keep all of those threads in your hands and find out, and then the economics, hold the pulse of the politicians.

08:11.356 --> 08:21.289
Because I found out somewhat later that when the politicians back to the wall, is to the wall with a hunger or famine close at hand,

08:21.860 --> 08:36.020
And then if you have previously checked for several years your technology on many farms, and you are pretty well convinced that it's as foolproof as you can make it.

08:36.180 --> 08:38.683
There's no zero biological risk in this world.

08:39.344 --> 08:42.228
That's pretty obvious to anyone who stops to think about it.

08:42.989 --> 08:45.413
And to illustrate, I always use this with students.

08:46.053 --> 08:50.820
I say, you know, the second when I was born, conceived, not born,

08:51.408 --> 08:57.313
I could have been any one of 800,000 or a million brothers or sisters, and I was pretty lucky.

08:58.154 --> 09:03.098
I was born with 10 fingers and 10 toes, a couple of pretty good legs and good general health.

09:03.158 --> 09:11.525
My mental tape was probably just mediocre, but I figured that with that start, I had to do the best I could to develop it, and that's the way it is.

09:12.366 --> 09:20.233
And remember, there's no biological risk, but when you have checked it, the best

09:20.365 --> 09:29.315
technology you can put together on a lot of farms, which would be like the extension people.

09:29.515 --> 09:33.540
And we sometimes worked with the extension after we had it going, but we had to do both.

09:33.941 --> 09:36.123
In the beginning there wasn't any extension.

09:36.143 --> 09:37.945
We were research and we were extension.

09:38.986 --> 09:49.198
And then when the pressures are on the political leader, and very often the senior scientist won't move.

09:49.218 --> 09:50.119
He's a bureaucrat.

09:50.842 --> 09:51.763
He's afraid to move.

09:51.843 --> 09:53.465
Status quo is comfortable for him.

09:53.525 --> 09:58.450
He struggled for 20 years to get to the top of the peak, and he's afraid of change.

09:58.530 --> 10:03.796
Somebody might rock the boat, and maybe there's an error in this technology, and maybe it'll destroy him.

10:03.936 --> 10:08.541
Something go wrong, he'll be blamed, and so took the heat.

10:09.562 --> 10:18.992
In the quiet of their own office, one of the biggest blockers in one country that I had to deal with, I tried to convince him.

10:20.440 --> 10:39.998
And I even took them to Mexico to show them the operation, put them in the hands of the farmers at that time, told them to educate them, what it was like around here before and what had happened in changes in yield, not only in wheat but other crops, and how farmers had participated, even in support of research, financial support.

10:40.018 --> 10:42.521
And he went back and he was insane.

10:43.201 --> 10:49.367
So I told the minister of agriculture in that case, I said, this guy, he's just

10:50.326 --> 10:56.576
paying lip service to you, and I know that he's blocking everything he can underneath.

10:57.037 --> 10:59.060
He said, go and talk to him, personally.

10:59.080 --> 11:00.262
You've known him for a long time.

11:00.302 --> 11:04.348
There's no animosity between he and you, or you and he.

11:04.368 --> 11:05.229
What country was this?

11:05.490 --> 11:05.951
Pakistan.

11:06.972 --> 11:15.085
And so I went to see him, and I said, Doctor so-and-so, the train is leaving.

11:17.360 --> 11:24.549
It's pulling out onto the main track, this new technological package.

11:24.569 --> 11:25.150
It's going to go.

11:26.251 --> 11:27.993
No longer any doubt.

11:28.013 --> 11:33.400
You should have been in the locomotive waving the flag and saying, look what we have done, what I have done.

11:34.541 --> 11:36.844
I said, the way you're acting, you're going to miss the caboose.

11:38.226 --> 11:39.888
I said, why have you done this?

11:40.329 --> 11:42.531
Why are you doing it?

11:42.551 --> 11:43.873
Then he told me frankly.

11:44.647 --> 11:51.435
I've worked for 25 years to reach one of the few paying jobs, decent paying jobs in the government.

11:52.857 --> 11:58.544
Supposing there's something wrong with that technology, there's a new race of rust that comes in and destroys the harvest.

11:58.665 --> 12:02.750
It's my job, it's my family's future, and you probably won't even be here when it's happened.

12:03.831 --> 12:09.017
I said, look, we've checked it for rust as best we know how, not only here but in many other countries.

12:09.758 --> 12:12.662
We think it's as good as can happen.

12:13.334 --> 12:14.816
Status quo is no good for you.

12:15.337 --> 12:19.021
With the population growth you've got, status quo is going backwards.

12:20.584 --> 12:23.788
Per capita wise, you're losing ground every hour.

12:24.849 --> 12:26.792
He said, yes, but I won't be blamed for that.

12:27.192 --> 12:30.076
That's somebody else's responsibility.

12:30.096 --> 12:38.807
This is the psychology of the bureaucrat, scientific or typical public servant who gets to the top of the heap.

12:39.248 --> 12:42.312
Status quo is comfortable, fear of the unknown.

12:42.545 --> 12:43.326
is overwhelming.

12:44.629 --> 12:47.494
Unfortunately it's at times even in universities.

12:47.634 --> 12:48.135
Sure it is.

12:48.195 --> 12:49.818
Which are supposed to deal with change.

12:52.343 --> 12:54.226
One of the major functions of a university.

12:54.927 --> 12:59.676
But anyway, let's move on before we get too depressed.

13:00.550 --> 13:09.700
I wanted to know the difference between the United States type of an extension service, research station, county agent, and you've already explained that with what you folks were doing.

13:10.440 --> 13:21.272
Except that ours wasn't detailed down to the ... We didn't have all of the nice organizational structures, nor the budgets, nor the number of trained people.

13:22.253 --> 13:24.996
A lot of it had to spread from farmer to farmer.

13:25.016 --> 13:27.538
Yeah, and we're still in the 1950s now.

13:27.578 --> 13:29.140
We're not into the 90s.

13:30.065 --> 13:34.189
Now I want to know... Well, part of this is spattered around in the 60s.

13:34.269 --> 13:34.770
Yeah, right.

13:36.292 --> 13:45.822
Now I want to know, we're still, though this is before 1960s, I want to know about the relationships.

13:45.842 --> 13:51.107
We've already talked about some of the relationships with the farmers during the late 40s and throughout the 50s.

13:51.127 --> 13:53.490
But I want to know, and we've touched on this a little bit too,

13:58.651 --> 14:20.793
What did these local politicians think when you, an American, and of course a number of Mexican, young Mexican scientists, when you were out here and you were holding your field days and you were demonstrating that these changes were possible, how did they relate to him?

14:21.254 --> 14:27.240
You didn't have any formal agreements with him, so how did they relate to him?

14:27.260 --> 14:28.641
I'm sure it was a mixed bag.

14:28.942 --> 14:36.530
First of all, the history of the two countries was not conducive to good understanding, and I don't need to go into the details on this.

14:36.550 --> 14:41.896
It's kind of a pretty sad blotch on our history.

14:41.916 --> 14:57.193
But it was surprising among the educated, even then, even though you were a gringo, if they thought that you were conscientious and working and trying to do something, I think that they forgave you for

14:57.747 --> 15:00.411
most of this, and they soon overlooked it completely.

15:01.212 --> 15:03.976
They may have, in the beginning, had this resentment.

15:05.619 --> 15:10.526
Most of them, of course, don't know enough history to understand this.

15:10.586 --> 15:13.831
The uneducated people, I think, they were oblivious to this.

15:14.612 --> 15:16.595
But the better educated, obviously, they were.

15:17.917 --> 15:20.220
So I think you had the whole mixed pattern there.

15:23.164 --> 15:26.269
In the politicians, of course, they were sensitive to this.

15:26.671 --> 15:29.194
Not a guy like Kais, because he was a big man.

15:30.436 --> 15:39.549
And he used to, once we gained his confidence, he'd drag me with him wherever he went, if it had to do with wheat or agricultural policy.

15:40.510 --> 15:56.492
But very often, if the president was out for some such thing, and I must say that the personalities sometimes were different, different secretaries of agriculture, but they would like to keep you in the background.

15:56.860 --> 16:01.507
and let some of the Mexicans explain it, which is natural.

16:01.567 --> 16:11.462
We were aware of this, and as soon as they were capable of doing a decent job, why, we've gotten the background at the field days or at the political meetings.

16:11.482 --> 16:25.483
You know, Experiment Station, when you've got things going and making progress, is a pretty good fertile fruit field and vineyard for the politicians to reap in the benefits.

16:26.375 --> 16:30.399
But then they don't want you too far out there where they can see that it's a foreigner.

16:31.961 --> 16:33.142
I think you understand that.

16:33.162 --> 16:34.504
Yes.

16:35.085 --> 16:35.185
Okay.

16:35.205 --> 16:39.069
So, in other words, it depended quite a bit on the individual politician.

16:39.089 --> 16:39.790
Yeah.

16:39.810 --> 16:44.155
And I think it depends on the kind of individuals we had.

16:44.195 --> 16:44.695
Yeah.

16:44.775 --> 16:52.804
I think we had some pretty aggressive people, and I think I had to be aggressive at certain times, and so did Herrar and Wellhausen.

16:53.307 --> 17:01.337
And some of the others, like Dr. L. M. Roberts, little Jaco here, who was director.

17:02.279 --> 17:08.547
First he was one of the corn breeders in Mexico and became the director in Colombia and spent his career with Rockefeller programs.

17:08.667 --> 17:10.069
Well, he was pretty aggressive too.

17:10.549 --> 17:13.713
But we knew when to talk and when not to talk.

17:14.855 --> 17:21.964
That's the difference, when to keep a low profile and when to move aggressively.

17:23.108 --> 17:26.373
In order to, there's no way of writing that formula.

17:26.874 --> 17:27.976
You've got to sense it.

17:28.597 --> 17:38.995
When the technology is good enough, when the confidence, not your confidence of them, theirs of you, is good enough to make a move.

17:40.197 --> 17:46.467
And when the pressures are great enough, with a fair possibility of making breakthrough.

17:47.020 --> 17:54.328
If you don't play that card at the right time and then the pressure is off, there's a couple of good crops, you may never be able to play it for another five or six years.

17:56.871 --> 17:59.774
So it's a matter of timing.

17:59.794 --> 17:59.934
Timing.

17:59.954 --> 18:02.877
Kind of the same words you're saying.

18:02.897 --> 18:03.017
Right.

18:03.037 --> 18:03.197
OK.

18:03.218 --> 18:04.719
Now let's talk a little bit about your reaction.

18:04.739 --> 18:07.082
I can put it into real Texanese if you'd like.

18:07.182 --> 18:07.542
Go ahead.

18:08.583 --> 18:15.711
You have to sense when that package has been adequately tested and then move aggressively.

18:16.130 --> 18:43.116
it's like knowing when the iron is hot yeah you need to dehorn with brand dehorn castrate and vaccinate all at the same time but you've got to make sure the calf is big enough to stand all of that abuse at one time or you'll kill them and kill yourself in this case okay now how about the relationship between and we're still in the 40s and 50s now the relationship between

18:46.488 --> 18:57.361
Your station up in the Obregon area and private companies, private Mexican companies and private American companies.

18:57.662 --> 19:00.525
You did discuss or talked a little bit about General Mills.

19:01.286 --> 19:06.092
Yeah, at that time there was no private agricultural sector when we began in Mexico.

19:06.112 --> 19:09.897
The first ones that started to show up were the machinery companies.

19:10.822 --> 19:38.601
of ford for forged and tractors and international harvester and john deere and so on agricultural chemicals as far as insecticides herbicides and so on that came considerably later at least 10 years so what we're talking about is almost exclusively american corporations or companies but the fertilizer thing was mostly imports originally by

19:38.783 --> 19:43.651
way of government except this one sad experience that I told you about.

19:43.671 --> 19:48.780
That was an American outfit and it damn near derailed us for ten years.

19:50.562 --> 19:59.357
And that person apparently knew that he was selling the wrong kind of fertilizer from the way he disappeared when I went to

20:00.097 --> 20:02.020
had an appointment to see him.

20:02.040 --> 20:03.502
So we had a mixed bag there too.

20:04.083 --> 20:18.685
Once there was a local distributor of fertilizer in the town of Toluca, and there was one farm that was American owned and managed by an American whom I used to collaborate with because he was a good farmer.

20:19.747 --> 20:27.859
And when they first started using fertilizer there in that valley, the high valley where we had our summer nurseries in Toluca,

20:28.396 --> 20:32.722
we had to have both nitrogen and phosphorus there to get the right response.

20:34.144 --> 20:37.588
And this person always got good results.

20:38.289 --> 20:39.070
He was a good farmer.

20:39.451 --> 20:40.392
That didn't surprise me.

20:41.774 --> 20:48.804
But many of his neighbors, he used to try to help the neighbors, tell them, put on this fertilizer, that fertilizer with their corn, especially if it was a corn region.

20:49.525 --> 20:53.049
And hell, there were no response, or very little.

20:54.912 --> 20:57.255
Finally, they caught this guy that was the retailer,

20:57.843 --> 21:03.249
Just mixing volcanic ash in for phosphors, no phosphors in it.

21:05.991 --> 21:06.652
Just nitrogen.

21:08.354 --> 21:11.918
So you go through all of these battle scars.

21:13.960 --> 21:26.753
But the private sector is relatively new in Mexico and the sort of, I guess it's an outwash from

21:26.918 --> 21:31.247
their social revolution, political revolution of 10 to 20.

21:31.868 --> 21:39.223
It's fairly state socialistic in approach, and although there's private sector involved,

21:39.727 --> 21:44.855
When it comes to basic food, they prefer to have a lot of this in government hands.

21:44.875 --> 21:48.380
The result is that the seed organization nearly wrecked us.

21:49.201 --> 21:57.674
In the first seeds that went to Pakistan and India, the 300 tons, 350 tons respectively, in 1965.

21:58.936 --> 22:08.029
When it arrived, it had a germination of, we didn't know it then because the war was on between the two countries and we had to plant without checking the ships arrived a month late.

22:08.937 --> 22:18.786
We had to plant without checking germination and seven days later we could see there's one plant here and one over here is a miserable emergence.

22:18.806 --> 22:22.457
So we had to send out telegrams to

22:22.741 --> 22:46.842
After contacting the minister in Pakistan where I was at the time of planting and Anderson was in India, I had with me in Pakistan Dr. Narvaez, my first Mexican trainee, then a full mature scientist, a good one, had the secretary minister send out telegrams to double all the seeding rates, something's wrong with the seed.

22:48.408 --> 22:54.676
and wire back to Wellhausen, by then our director in Mexico, and says something's wrong with that damn seed and find out where.

22:55.717 --> 23:05.368
And so he talked to the Mexican minister and they send an impartial scientist up to take samples out of that border, out of that warehouse where the seed came from up in Mexicali.

23:07.251 --> 23:15.360
It had anywhere from eight, I guess I gave it generous, ten to twenty-eight percent germination.

23:16.742 --> 23:17.503
That was the...

23:18.327 --> 23:23.894
And that government seed organization was trying to say that the seed was damaged by the shipping company.

23:25.356 --> 23:27.539
It was over-fumigated in Mexico.

23:27.680 --> 23:29.923
That's what happened with the monopoly.

23:30.483 --> 23:36.531
And when that happened, Caiz again got aggressive.

23:37.392 --> 23:43.100
When he heard about this, and by doubling the seeding rate and fertilizing some more, it came through.

23:43.661 --> 23:46.765
But it hung on that thin thread in both countries.

23:47.538 --> 23:52.845
And when Kais heard about this, he was very interested in what the impact of this was in other countries.

23:54.808 --> 24:13.613
When he heard, long before harvest, in the fall of the year, what a terrible time we had had, he just stomped down to the minister's office and said, look, this has been happening to the seed we've been getting from the government seed organization.

24:15.280 --> 24:21.608
He said, we want now, and this was after he had established this patronato, using their money to support research.

24:22.750 --> 24:30.300
We have been working now for whatever it was by then, it was 66, 56, more than 10 years, putting money into this.

24:31.101 --> 24:35.887
We demand half of the basic seed when it leaves the experiment station.

24:36.067 --> 24:37.449
We'll multiply our part.

24:37.469 --> 24:41.515
The other half can go to your government seed organization.

24:41.535 --> 24:43.397
And that became the way it was done.

24:45.453 --> 24:47.596
And that broke their monopoly.

24:47.796 --> 24:49.378
Then they have to measure up.

24:50.440 --> 24:56.929
And that doesn't mean either one of them are 100%, but it's a lot better than it ever was.

24:57.410 --> 25:00.734
But he never lived to see the full impact.

25:00.754 --> 25:11.950
When I came back in March, when I came back from Pakistan and India in March, and it was beautiful in the spring of 66,

25:13.634 --> 25:15.356
It was beautiful how it recovered.

25:16.156 --> 25:17.458
And everybody was impressed.

25:17.758 --> 25:23.123
But to me, it was at least 30% off of the yields that we should have had in most places.

25:24.845 --> 25:33.833
And when I got to Tucson, on the way back to Ciudad Obregun, I met Jorge Parada on the street, one of these farmers, the same close friends.

25:34.053 --> 25:38.998
He said, say, did you know that Rodolfo is in the hospital in Houston?

25:39.218 --> 25:40.559
He had a bypass operation.

25:40.579 --> 25:43.422
Debaki did it about a week.

25:43.925 --> 25:44.365
or go.

25:44.946 --> 25:45.947
He's getting along fine.

25:48.429 --> 25:49.210
No, I didn't know.

25:49.310 --> 25:50.211
I was over in India.

25:50.331 --> 25:58.039
So, I sat down and fortunately wrote him a pretty good account of what was happening.

25:58.339 --> 25:59.900
It was going to go and was going to fly.

26:00.801 --> 26:01.902
I found out later.

26:02.503 --> 26:08.128
He got that the day before he died, and he had read it, and he was tremendously enthusiastic.

26:08.729 --> 26:12.953
His oldest son came over to tell me about it.

26:15.025 --> 26:17.748
It's curious how these things work out.

26:19.690 --> 26:21.792
Why do you have complications with the bypass?

26:21.812 --> 26:23.273
Complication with the bypass.

26:23.333 --> 26:25.616
I don't know actually the details of what happened.

26:27.037 --> 26:28.378
It was a tremendous character.

26:28.438 --> 26:30.621
Those were relatively new back then.

26:31.061 --> 26:33.924
Yes.

26:33.944 --> 26:36.146
That is a shame.

26:36.186 --> 26:42.973
That brings me to another question that I'm interested in, and that dealt with distribution of the seed.

26:43.983 --> 26:56.895
And I would have imagined that a private industry, a private American company, would have been quite interested in getting some sort of contract and producing

26:57.196 --> 27:00.463
and then distributing and making a nice profit off of that.

27:00.603 --> 27:04.291
Weren't any American companies interested in selling this sea?

27:04.512 --> 27:14.513
Well, I think at that time they didn't even know that we existed, and probably secondly, they wouldn't have been well received at that time in Mexico anyway.

27:14.493 --> 27:16.736
No, they probably wouldn't have.

27:16.756 --> 27:24.588
And it's questionable whether we would have thought it good judgment to even become affiliated with them because of this philosophy.

27:25.449 --> 27:26.471
You understand what I mean?

27:26.491 --> 27:26.691
Yes.

27:28.474 --> 27:44.297
So, I think that there were several factors there that probably weren't yet ripe for that kind of... Did a major seed corporation ever come in and attempt to... Well, they came in in corn or sorghum first.

27:45.003 --> 27:48.567
because the government seed organization wasn't interested in soil.

27:48.587 --> 28:01.381
So, the hybrids from Southwest, including Texas, came in and were highly successful, distributed, produced locally from the lines, distributed, became highly successful.

28:01.802 --> 28:06.126
The government wouldn't permit them to work in hybrid corn for many years.

28:06.227 --> 28:07.568
It's only been about

28:09.083 --> 28:17.454
seven or eight, maybe ten, eight years or so ago, when then they begrudgingly permitted them to start work on hybrid corn.

28:18.756 --> 28:24.343
And it's just now getting to the stage where it's, where they're starting to have some impact.

28:26.946 --> 28:28.709
The companies are having some impact?

28:28.909 --> 28:29.750
Just starting.

28:29.770 --> 28:30.891
Private companies.

28:30.912 --> 28:31.272
They did.

28:31.292 --> 28:33.755
They have had in sorghum.

28:35.097 --> 28:37.420
In the case of corn,

28:37.552 --> 28:41.298
or sorghum, they haven't had any highly successful ones.

28:41.318 --> 28:46.347
They've had one that's been pretty good in vegetable seeds.

28:47.048 --> 28:48.130
Good, as a matter of fact.

28:49.192 --> 28:53.298
And these farmers co-ops in multiplying wheat seed.

28:53.318 --> 29:02.614
We're trying to get them to multiply the open pollinated, high nutritive value new corn varieties.

29:03.235 --> 29:06.660
and they're just starting to do this in part.

29:06.941 --> 29:28.956
It took us after the basic discovery in 1964 at Purdue, where they found that this particular type of OPEC-2 corn had twice as much lysine and tryptophan, which are the two essential amino acids that are limiting nutritive value in corn.

29:29.864 --> 29:44.266
Everybody thought that when this was discovered and proven that there were biologically active difference levels, that it would be very easy to incorporate this into hybrids, and you'd have this as a bonus on top of the high yield.

29:44.286 --> 29:53.640
It turned out it was very complicated, and so the hybrid corn companies, including the universities, after spending a lot of money for about seven or eight years, gave it up.

29:54.461 --> 29:57.205
But our people kept working.

29:57.539 --> 30:12.337
And the thing that made it a success was that we had very good biological laboratory analysis combined with good genetics and plant breeding and close collaboration, testing of thousands of samples as you were converting.

30:12.837 --> 30:23.310
It turned out that the soft type genetically, because the starch was fluffy in the kernels, wasn't packed in, yielded about

30:25.062 --> 30:33.235
20%, 25% less than the dent corns and the flint corns into which they had to be crossed.

30:34.356 --> 30:39.905
They were also more susceptible to insects, both in the field and in the warehouse, and to ear rods.

30:41.267 --> 30:45.674
And because of that combination of defects, they never went across.

30:46.756 --> 30:50.582
But our people kept working and handling thousands of samples.

30:50.962 --> 30:52.825
As you converted the kernels back,

30:53.632 --> 30:55.294
toward hardness.

30:56.035 --> 30:57.617
You couldn't with just the light.

30:58.538 --> 31:07.009
The way you could tell the original opaque from the normal, you put it on top of the glass with the light from underneath, and the opaque shut off the passage of lights.

31:07.649 --> 31:12.996
In the dent and the flints, they were vitreous, and so it reflected through.

31:13.757 --> 31:20.786
But then when you started to convert them back to hards, you couldn't tell whether the hard one had the high lysine or it had lost it.

31:21.146 --> 31:22.828
You couldn't tell it from the normal.

31:23.298 --> 31:43.463
and only by chemical analysis, tens of thousands over twelve years have we reconstructed those now that yield as much as the normal or slightly more than the ones they were derived from and have the benefits of the additional high nutritive value.

31:44.224 --> 31:46.707
And now, of course,

31:47.598 --> 31:58.089
As Bill Brown, the Director, Chairman of the Board of Pioneers, says, well, he said, we invited him down to look at the program about two years ago now, give us a personal opinion.

31:58.569 --> 31:59.350
He says, you've done it.

31:59.930 --> 32:04.695
We didn't have the right linkage between the biochemical laboratory and the field.

32:05.416 --> 32:11.162
He said, you've done it, and when we get our other priorities out of the way, we'll do it too.

32:11.182 --> 32:14.365
So, it's kind of curious how these things unfold.

32:16.606 --> 32:20.230
And again, continuity was the important part here.

32:21.932 --> 32:45.280
Nobody was, and Dr. Sprague, who just retired, he protected like a mother hen, Evangelina Viegas, our biochemist, and Dr. Sander Vasil, our Indian geneticist and breeder, because there were plenty of hawks trying to tear him apart and saying we were going down a dead end.

32:46.407 --> 32:47.589
from the funding agencies.

32:47.649 --> 32:55.041
You see, now, unlike in the old Rockefeller programs, in the international centers, we've got a lot of bureaucratic things creeping in.

32:55.942 --> 33:06.038
Up in that consultative group in support of international agriculture, this secretariat in the World Bank, where all the money's come together, which has become a big substance, a big quantity.

33:07.541 --> 33:09.664
Most of those people have never done any research.

33:10.623 --> 33:14.430
and they're passing judgments and asking for reports on this, that, and the other.

33:14.671 --> 33:25.712
They're forced to do it because now the funds are coming from 35 different Western world governments and some of them Eastern Chinese.

33:27.093 --> 33:41.969
from World Bank and from UNDP, United Nations Special Fund, and so you've got to fill out lots of reports and it becomes very bureaucratic, and you've got lots of people passing judgment that aren't qualified to pass judgment.

33:42.470 --> 33:43.751
That's protected them.

33:44.092 --> 33:46.094
That's a problem in all of the disciplines.

33:48.196 --> 33:53.742
Every time I put in for a National Endowment for the Humanities grant, it's someone who knows a lot less about what

33:55.628 --> 34:00.154
Those people don't, you know, they don't know, but they have to pass judgment.

34:00.575 --> 34:16.396
That brings me to another issue, and that is, we've been talking basically about wheat and what you were trying to do with wheat on your section in the late 40s and throughout the 1950s, but whatever happened to corn and beans?

34:17.457 --> 34:24.066
Well, the bean thing was sort of an orphan, and it lagged behind miserably.

34:25.463 --> 34:27.525
compared to what support it should have had.

34:27.625 --> 34:31.330
I'm talking about under the Rockefeller program.

34:31.370 --> 34:31.450
Why?

34:32.631 --> 34:34.273
Mostly because of lack of continuity.

34:34.894 --> 34:38.117
There were quite a few people in charge of the program, and it changed.

34:39.379 --> 34:51.252
You never had the continuity, and consequently, somebody who was accumulating a hell of a lot of knowledge, not just on the breeding, but disease, insects, and all of the way to grow it, and the marketing.

34:51.272 --> 34:54.576
In other words, there was a large turnover of personnel.

34:56.682 --> 34:58.464
And in part.

34:59.065 --> 35:01.308
And they started a BAME program in Colombia.

35:01.528 --> 35:12.922
But when the international organizations finally were spun off here as a result of this, the network, now CIOT in Colombia, I think, is making very good progress.

35:13.143 --> 35:15.786
What does that stand for, CIOT?

35:15.806 --> 35:23.736
Center for International... Center for Investigation in Tropical Agriculture.

35:24.408 --> 35:27.932
Centro Internacional de Agricultura Tropical.

35:29.173 --> 35:41.648
It's one of the 13 centers, and they're working primarily on cassava, maniat, beans, and some on tropical forages.

35:43.450 --> 35:45.392
Those are the primary crops they're working on.

35:45.412 --> 35:46.213
And when was that instituted?

35:47.088 --> 35:49.551
It was the third one to come on stream.

35:49.571 --> 35:54.498
First, Erie, the International Rice Research Institute, which was modeled after hours.

35:54.678 --> 35:56.341
Did I ever tell you how this came about?

35:56.581 --> 35:57.683
No, no.

35:57.703 --> 35:59.065
Then you need to know this.

35:59.125 --> 36:08.117
Well, we have to, let's... You need to make a note because this is a key thing that shows... Yeah, because this demonstrates a transition from the Rockefeller years to

36:13.328 --> 36:26.099
Okay, so in other words, beans, as far as Mexico is concerned, which is one-third of the original program under the Rockefeller, floundered and not much.

36:26.119 --> 36:27.721
During the Rockefeller program.

36:27.741 --> 36:37.630
Now the national program's got a pretty good bean program going, but I think the one in the International Center in Colombia is sort of opening the way.

36:38.510 --> 36:39.551
Okay.

36:39.611 --> 36:41.513
Now what happened to the corn?

36:42.235 --> 36:46.361
The corn went through many changes in leadership and it sent it back.

36:46.781 --> 37:01.281
Plus, it had the bad luck of falling directly under the control of the seed organization, the Corn Commission, who tried to dictate that the corns at that time had to be hybrids because they wanted the monopoly.

37:02.723 --> 37:08.631
Wellhausen originally had started out to make improved synthetic varieties, which the farmer could

37:09.050 --> 37:18.625
get seed and continue to grow for a number of years without having to reinvest because of the lack of organization to distribute it and the lack of buying power.

37:19.907 --> 37:26.997
And that was not the way the people who gained control of that seed organization, we didn't have them in wheat.

37:27.057 --> 37:29.742
Nobody thought wheat was going to become an important crop.

37:30.843 --> 37:32.005
So they left us alone.

37:32.426 --> 37:34.669
It was partly by government neglect then?

37:35.088 --> 37:45.004
that we had free roll, and once they saw that we were out in the clear, they tried to get their arms around us and choke us, and Kais and the co-ops wouldn't let them.

37:49.651 --> 38:00.087
Isn't it funny how the human parts of these pictures change the rhythm, the way they evolve?

38:00.107 --> 38:01.129
Sure, pure luck.

38:03.607 --> 38:12.142
Because if you would have been placed under some form of a government bureaucracy, they would have been dictating to you left and right too.

38:12.322 --> 38:13.524
Just like in the corn poker.

38:14.486 --> 38:14.666
Sure.

38:14.686 --> 38:19.595
The result might have been that after a year or two, you would have just become disgusted and left.

38:19.615 --> 38:19.875
Sure.

38:21.678 --> 38:26.627
But nobody paid any attention to us because they were sure that wheat wouldn't be grown successfully in Mexico.

38:28.261 --> 38:50.607
As a matter of fact, in the early years I must have looked pretty unhappy sometimes because the sub-secretary of agriculture in that first administration that I worked under, he was a wonderful, warm individual, Gonzales Carriado, he was a trained agronomist but never done any research, but he understood agriculture pretty well, and he used to say, but Dr. Borlaug,

38:51.329 --> 38:52.611
don't take it so hard.

38:52.671 --> 39:00.223
He says, we know that Mexico can never produce the weed it needs, but do the best you can and see if you can help improve the situation a bit.

39:06.013 --> 39:07.335
It's funny how it all works.

39:09.178 --> 39:10.961
That is interesting.

39:10.981 --> 39:18.012
There must be other differences though, and it must give you some gratification

39:18.599 --> 39:29.450
to know that there were basically three researchers carrying out three different types of programs in Mexico in the early days, and you're the one who basically succeeded.

39:30.171 --> 39:30.451
Why?

39:30.471 --> 39:40.882
Well, I think we have to say that the corn program has made impact, and the impact now is ready to go on the corn program in many different niches of the world.

39:41.202 --> 39:45.687
Sprague, before he retired, since the last...

39:48.164 --> 39:49.667
Thirteen, fourteen years.

39:50.688 --> 39:53.073
He originally worked in India.

39:53.093 --> 39:56.679
He got a fairly decent program started, small, but it had some impact.

39:56.699 --> 40:05.234
And then he was moved to Thailand, and he was successful in making Thailand an importer of corn, or exporter, the only exporter in Asia.

40:05.354 --> 40:09.161
And then he came back to headquarters.

40:09.261 --> 40:11.505
He was a rockfellow man originally also.

40:11.772 --> 40:14.136
and he was there for 14 years.

40:14.417 --> 40:16.560
He's still young and vigorous.

40:16.620 --> 40:30.284
He's got about six or seven years when he should have stayed on, but he's kind of a complex personality, but that program is ready to move now and it's ready to make impact.

40:30.925 --> 40:33.489
I hope the new director keeps it on track.

40:33.890 --> 40:34.932
It's ready to flower.

40:35.833 --> 40:36.835
And that's the one in Thailand?

40:38.030 --> 40:39.733
Is that the program in Thailand?

40:39.753 --> 40:40.534
No, in Mexico.

40:40.734 --> 40:42.757
Oh, okay, so that's the one in Mexico.

40:42.897 --> 40:46.423
He was transferred back to head the whole Mexican program in 1971.

40:46.443 --> 40:47.064
Oh, okay.

40:47.324 --> 40:49.507
And how long did he stay there then?

40:49.848 --> 40:59.042
Until the end of last year, when he took early retirement.

40:59.062 --> 41:00.404
Dr. Ernie Sprague.

41:01.966 --> 41:06.433
And so it's ready to produce now, unless it's mismanaged.

41:07.223 --> 41:11.309
But whether this new director can sell the goods, he's got the package.

41:13.672 --> 41:18.940
And whenever you change horses in the middle of the stream, I'm skeptical.

41:18.960 --> 41:22.204
Because they don't know how good that technology is.

41:22.965 --> 41:23.907
Do you understand what I mean?

41:23.967 --> 41:25.529
It's not the fault of the individual.

41:26.110 --> 41:28.613
It goes right back to this question of continuity.

41:29.535 --> 41:35.323
If that thing were out in big commercial now, it would have enough momentum

41:35.995 --> 41:45.253
so that while the new director picks up the pieces and understands what he's managing, it would continue to move forward.

41:45.273 --> 41:49.161
There's a good research core underneath, young people, vigorous,

41:50.103 --> 42:03.354
But as you well know, if the director doesn't handle it right, that young team will fly apart in all parts of the world because they're known to be very productive corn scientists.

42:03.374 --> 42:04.415
They don't have to stay there.

42:05.196 --> 42:08.038
These are critical issues that always come into the picture.

42:09.880 --> 42:12.322
So I see at least two reasons.

42:12.442 --> 42:19.148
I don't want to put words in your mouth, but I see at least two reasons then for the fact that in those years of the

42:23.718 --> 42:26.783
and the others didn't, and one was, let's just say, continuity.

42:27.664 --> 42:36.537
Another one was the lack of government interference on wheat, but not so on the other two.

42:37.058 --> 42:40.684
Well, the bean, there wasn't interference, it was just neglect.

42:40.984 --> 42:46.352
We didn't have enough continuity and the right manpower to head the program.

42:46.432 --> 42:51.480
And the other issue then is personalities of the three directors.

42:52.456 --> 42:56.119
We never had the right person in charge of that beam program.

42:56.640 --> 43:01.204
Wellhausen was in charge of both corn and beans, and he was capable of running both of them.

43:01.224 --> 43:09.032
But when Herrera was moved to New York office in about 1950, Dr. Wellhausen became the program director.

43:09.612 --> 43:13.616
Administratively took up virtually all, yes, all of his time.

43:14.497 --> 43:20.843
But he still, because of love for the corn plant, he tried to maintain control.

43:21.363 --> 43:23.987
Maybe I shouldn't say control, but a strong influence.

43:24.808 --> 43:26.892
But he was losing contact all of the time.

43:27.072 --> 43:29.095
And this discouraged the people that were there.

43:29.496 --> 43:31.939
And so we lost some of the best talent there.

43:33.682 --> 43:34.503
It's complicated.

43:35.004 --> 43:37.989
And I'm not pointing a finger at any personality.

43:39.511 --> 43:48.585
And I'm hesitant to mention names.

43:49.291 --> 44:05.448
I think that several of those people who, starting with Wellhouse, and several of them who followed, didn't stay too long, but followed, had a lot more ability than I had, but they didn't have the continuity.

44:06.970 --> 44:09.493
Maybe they didn't know how to... Maybe determination.

44:09.513 --> 44:10.114
Maybe.

44:10.134 --> 44:12.396
Maybe they didn't know how to master their assets.

44:12.815 --> 44:13.115
Maybe.

44:13.796 --> 44:19.541
Maybe they didn't also have a feel for how to handle the politicians and maybe the human side of the issue.

44:20.122 --> 44:24.025
I think that may have been quite a bit of it.

44:24.045 --> 44:32.192
I'm hesitant to mention this because I'm afraid somebody might say, oh hell, Borlaug's egotistical, and I don't mean it in that sense at all.

44:34.214 --> 44:35.375
I'm trying to be analytical.

44:36.196 --> 44:42.822
I don't have anything to sell except trying to get a message across about how it happened as I interpret

44:44.759 --> 44:50.989
and trying to be as unbiased as I can from the point of view that I'm expressing.
