WEBVTT

00:02.748 --> 00:05.771
You left then in the summer of 44.

00:06.072 --> 00:09.936
No, summer of 43.

00:09.956 --> 00:10.697
43.

00:12.038 --> 00:18.446
And by that time had the enrollment gone down?

00:18.586 --> 00:18.926
Yes.

00:19.687 --> 00:23.071
Yes, it went down to I don't know what.

00:23.651 --> 00:28.637
Were there any of the special training units on the campus by that time?

00:33.258 --> 00:35.260
Let's see.

00:35.480 --> 00:41.347
Now, if you will, come back to A&M when the war is over.

00:41.427 --> 00:42.208
When did you get back?

00:45.932 --> 00:55.042
Got back in August of 46.

00:56.123 --> 00:58.265
So the war had been over almost a year.

00:59.306 --> 01:02.590
Yeah, I was in a year of occupation in Japan.

01:02.975 --> 01:04.077
How had you changed?

01:04.818 --> 01:05.679
How had I changed?

01:08.743 --> 01:11.427
I was a little older.

01:11.447 --> 01:12.648
I'm not sure how much wiser.

01:13.389 --> 01:14.771
But, yeah, quite a bit.

01:14.791 --> 01:24.565
Yeah, I changed a lot.

01:24.585 --> 01:29.992
I got back in the end of July.

01:30.012 --> 01:31.294
Got married in August.

01:32.354 --> 01:40.565
And we had a week honeymoon at a friend's house in Pont, Texas.

01:41.026 --> 01:52.681
And then went to A&M, where I got $90 a month.

01:53.542 --> 01:53.903
From what?

01:53.923 --> 02:00.031
From the government, GI Bill, which paid my rent, paid my expenses at school, paid my food, everything.

02:00.051 --> 02:00.592
And it paid everything.

02:00.612 --> 02:01.433
Where did y'all live?

02:01.818 --> 02:02.679
They lived in Hart Hall.

02:04.482 --> 02:08.648
They put two of those rooms together with the bathroom in the middle.

02:09.889 --> 02:13.194
And one room was our kitchen and one room was our bedroom.

02:13.214 --> 02:15.357
Tell us, I didn't know that.

02:15.377 --> 02:16.839
Tell us about living in the middle of the campus.

02:17.500 --> 02:18.281
It was wonderful.

02:18.361 --> 02:21.185
Sarah just thought she had died and gone to heaven.

02:21.706 --> 02:23.689
Was Hart Hall filled with couples?

02:23.749 --> 02:25.391
Yes, filled with couples.

02:27.053 --> 02:31.099
And there was, the toilet paper was very rare.

02:31.366 --> 02:33.428
Cokes were very rare.

02:33.468 --> 02:35.991
They didn't have any coke colas.

02:36.651 --> 02:42.237
And I've forgotten the other things that were rare, but things like toilet paper.

02:43.718 --> 02:51.086
Sarah and all the women were at all the midnight yell practices because they would bring the toilet paper, throw it up there, and they were there folding it all.

02:57.412 --> 02:59.314
I do remember that so well, Sarah.

02:59.868 --> 03:04.397
All the girls would pick up the rolls and try to fold it back.

03:04.537 --> 03:07.683
Describe the life in the dormitory.

03:07.763 --> 03:13.615
Did you all sometimes more than one couple eat together?

03:14.477 --> 03:17.322
Was there a social interaction of those young couples?

03:17.342 --> 03:18.805
Yeah, there were some.

03:19.443 --> 03:21.806
But it was still a business kind of a thing.

03:21.846 --> 03:25.811
We were still in school, and I was more serious about my school.

03:25.972 --> 03:30.157
I made a hell of a lot better grades when I came back than I did when I was there.

03:30.918 --> 03:33.001
You still majored in economics.

03:33.021 --> 03:37.687
Yeah, yeah, and I was 14 hours short, so I got the 14 hours.

03:37.807 --> 03:38.067
All right.

03:39.289 --> 03:42.894
What was your attire then for going to class?

03:44.395 --> 03:45.217
Anything.

03:45.237 --> 03:47.880
All right, so you can close.

03:49.025 --> 03:57.557
And we went to school with core people and I got to meet some of the core people.

03:57.577 --> 04:05.329
Did the routine of conversation on the sidewalk and the hallway, was it different then than what it had been?

04:05.349 --> 04:11.598
Oh yeah, we had a, there were as many veterans as there were.

04:12.018 --> 04:15.403
Well, there weren't, but it seemed like it.

04:16.092 --> 04:20.777
And you'd walk down the campus, there were as many civilians as there were, as I recall it.

04:20.797 --> 04:28.386
And the courses I took had more civilians than the Corps.

04:28.406 --> 04:31.009
And civilians meaning veterans.

04:31.029 --> 04:32.591
We had a veterans organization.

04:34.773 --> 04:41.841
Sid Smith was elected president of the veterans class and I was vice president of it.

04:41.861 --> 04:44.344
And we had a meeting over at

04:45.944 --> 04:51.091
Whatever that place was where the chapel is now, what do we call that?

04:51.111 --> 04:52.032
Was that Assembly Hall?

04:52.172 --> 04:54.135
Assembly Hall, yeah, Assembly Hall.

04:54.155 --> 04:56.378
That's it.

04:56.398 --> 05:00.404
And we got the place that was full of veterans.

05:00.424 --> 05:08.995
We had our agenda and we would meet from time to time and have veterans problems just like they have today.

05:09.316 --> 05:10.998
Never any demonstrations.

05:11.018 --> 05:14.142
Who was the key administrator then at A&M?

05:14.162 --> 05:14.803
Who was in charge?

05:16.285 --> 05:17.126
The president?

05:22.331 --> 05:22.632
T.O.

05:22.692 --> 05:26.476
Walton was the president.

05:26.496 --> 05:27.076
Or Gilchrist?

05:28.138 --> 05:30.180
Gilchrist was, I guess, when I came back.

05:30.200 --> 05:30.800
Yeah, T.O.

05:30.841 --> 05:34.104
Walton was when I first got to the NA.

05:34.224 --> 05:37.608
And Gilchrist was, yeah, he was the CEO.

05:37.628 --> 05:41.652
So you weren't involved in that march on Gilchrist's house.

05:41.918 --> 05:45.562
in the fall of 46 by the Corps members?

05:46.082 --> 05:47.224
No.

05:47.244 --> 05:48.645
No.

05:48.825 --> 05:56.974
Do you remember any incidents where a sophomore who had never been anywhere during the war got out of line with a civilian?

05:57.394 --> 05:57.674
No.

05:57.694 --> 05:58.936
No Corps member ever?

05:58.956 --> 05:59.216
No.

05:59.236 --> 05:59.656
Okay.

05:59.676 --> 06:00.998
No.

06:01.198 --> 06:02.760
No, I never remember anything like that.

06:02.780 --> 06:09.487
Did you and your older colleagues look at some of the things happening in the Corps and smile and chuckle?

06:10.728 --> 06:10.828
Yeah.

06:12.074 --> 06:16.138
but have respect for it, as we do today.

06:16.359 --> 06:16.499
Yeah.

06:16.879 --> 06:26.890
What was, as you thought, as you realize now, what was your basic attitude about being at A&M in 1946?

06:26.950 --> 06:27.871
What were you there for?

06:28.572 --> 06:29.653
I was there to get a degree.

06:30.994 --> 06:33.877
And you were then, want that degree, you were going to go out and do what?

06:33.897 --> 06:34.718
Just automatic.

06:34.878 --> 06:39.003
It never occurred to me to do anything else but to get a degree.

06:39.023 --> 06:41.946
And then I had no idea what I was going to do.

06:42.179 --> 06:44.862
Now, what did Sarah do during those years?

06:46.003 --> 06:53.532
Sarah got with the other girls and found out where the coats were and where the toilet paper was and all the stuff that we needed.

06:53.612 --> 06:55.735
But she loved her time.

06:55.755 --> 06:57.136
Did many of those wives work?

06:59.619 --> 07:04.044
I'm sure they did, but Sarah didn't, and neither did her friends.

07:04.365 --> 07:11.713
Bob Latimer was there, and Jane and Sarah met each other for the first time and became good friends, I remember.

07:12.352 --> 07:16.057
Describe your apartment.

07:16.077 --> 07:24.850
Well, it was just two square rooms and they built in a sink and we had an oven.

07:24.870 --> 07:30.458
And Sarah was a home ec major so Sarah never had any problem cooking.

07:30.478 --> 07:35.025
She loved to cook and so she made fine meals for me.

07:35.045 --> 07:36.587
I mean, I love always eating well.

07:36.837 --> 07:39.301
Was the furniture provided by?

07:39.521 --> 07:40.723
Yeah, furniture was provided.

07:40.783 --> 07:45.811
It was GI furniture, probably the same furniture we had when we were students.

07:45.831 --> 07:46.953
We just had more of it.

07:46.993 --> 07:56.687
We had two beds and well I guess one bed looked probably like it did when the student was there.

07:56.707 --> 07:58.330
And then we had the extra.

07:58.610 --> 07:59.652
So two single beds?

07:59.712 --> 08:00.313
Yeah.

08:01.036 --> 08:03.578
Two single beds, they were like that.

08:03.618 --> 08:06.241
They weren't stacked.

08:06.261 --> 08:09.283
No, no, they weren't stacked, but they weren't straight across.

08:09.363 --> 08:10.945
They were swayed back.

08:11.245 --> 08:17.651
They had no boards across it like you would a normal bed does.

08:18.451 --> 08:25.057
And then the other room, you had what kind of a table?

08:25.197 --> 08:27.699
It was a table for me to study on.

08:27.719 --> 08:29.021
I had to put my books on.

08:29.101 --> 08:30.722
Did you eat at that same table?

08:32.052 --> 08:34.074
Yeah, we ate at that same table.

08:34.094 --> 08:35.195
It was big enough to seat?

08:36.376 --> 08:36.697
Four.

08:37.858 --> 08:40.660
You could seat four real easily at that table.

08:40.680 --> 08:47.147
Now, what did you couples then do on weekends for relaxation?

08:48.848 --> 08:52.852
You know, we went to movies.

08:54.073 --> 08:56.576
There really wasn't a lot to do.

08:56.616 --> 08:57.837
Sometimes we went to Houston.

08:57.857 --> 08:59.038
We were so close to Houston.

08:59.058 --> 08:59.899
Where were the movies?

09:00.706 --> 09:07.575
The movies were still in Guy and All and they were in Bryan.

09:07.595 --> 09:08.235
You had a car.

09:08.255 --> 09:10.859
I had a car then, yeah.

09:11.039 --> 09:13.181
Tell me about the car.

09:13.322 --> 09:21.872
It was my father and mother had given me, Sarah and I, a car for our wedding presents.

09:21.892 --> 09:23.494
We had two cars.

09:23.534 --> 09:28.941
We had that car and we had a, Sarah had a convertible.

09:29.225 --> 09:31.328
I don't know what year it was.

09:33.170 --> 09:38.617
Hers was a couple years old and mine was brand name.

09:38.637 --> 09:47.048
Couldn't be a couple years old at 46 because they'd make cars during the war.

09:47.068 --> 09:48.029
I don't know what year it was.

09:48.089 --> 09:59.063
It was a convertible and it was a convertible that she got, I don't know what year it was.

10:00.173 --> 10:05.920
And was the... I took that car to Fort Sill, Oklahoma a couple of times.

10:05.940 --> 10:07.662
It was a very good car.

10:08.383 --> 10:16.133
And when I was stationed up there, I don't know, I'd leave late or something.

10:16.213 --> 10:20.699
I'd have to get up there, so I'd go up and come back the next weekend or something like that.

10:20.719 --> 10:22.902
And this new one your dad gave you was a what?

10:23.002 --> 10:23.242
Ford.

10:23.803 --> 10:24.684
It was a Ford.

10:24.704 --> 10:25.405
A 46 Ford?

10:25.605 --> 10:25.825
Uh-huh.

10:25.845 --> 10:27.708
So that was a new one.

10:27.728 --> 10:27.928
Yeah.

10:27.948 --> 10:28.168
All right.

10:28.188 --> 10:29.590
And then you graduate when?

10:31.021 --> 10:34.586
I graduated in January, the end of January of 47.

10:34.967 --> 10:36.529
Seven.

10:36.890 --> 10:40.915
So you're only there, you only needed 14 hours to graduate?

10:41.196 --> 10:41.697
Mm-hmm.

10:41.717 --> 10:42.938
So I was there one semester.

10:43.099 --> 10:43.499
Okay.

10:44.080 --> 10:45.823
But through a football season.

10:45.963 --> 10:46.063
Okay.

10:46.083 --> 10:47.645
Through the exciting part of the year.

10:47.906 --> 10:48.807
Okay.

10:48.827 --> 10:50.690
There was a lot of happening.

10:50.710 --> 10:54.695
We went to, again, we went to all the sporting events.

10:54.716 --> 10:59.863
Sarah went to the basketball games, swimming meets, whatever A&M was playing, and we went in.

11:00.063 --> 11:03.046
Alright, let's talk about some of the events on campus.

11:03.946 --> 11:08.190
What all occurred in Guyon Hall?

11:08.210 --> 11:14.215
Well, Town Hall had singers, dance groups.

11:14.675 --> 11:16.237
Do you remember any of them?

11:18.759 --> 11:23.923
No, and I should have because I was Town Hall manager too my junior year.

11:24.764 --> 11:29.648
And I'd be darned if I can remember

11:30.033 --> 11:33.037
And some of the dances, were there big?

11:33.057 --> 11:33.978
There weren't, no.

11:34.058 --> 11:36.201
There were all ballet or anything like that, no.

11:37.663 --> 11:43.811
These were just probably Mexican dance groups.

11:43.851 --> 11:45.493
Okay, so movies and concerts.

11:45.673 --> 11:51.881
Was there anything, was there any religious type event in Guyana?

11:51.901 --> 11:52.142
Yeah, yeah.

11:52.202 --> 11:52.522
Church.

11:54.645 --> 11:56.327
Of what sort?

11:57.117 --> 12:03.723
Well, visitors visiting ones that would be Presbyterian one week.

12:04.204 --> 12:05.425
Was there one every Sunday?

12:06.006 --> 12:06.826
One every Sunday.

12:07.367 --> 12:09.769
Was there a religious emphasis week yet?

12:10.149 --> 12:14.193
Yeah, I think there was a religious emphasis week, yeah.

12:14.534 --> 12:24.323
I was a member of a church in Houston, Central Presbyterian Church, and so I go to church all the time, and I went there from the United States.

12:25.045 --> 12:30.611
When you attended church at A&M, did you go to the A&M Presbyterian or did you attend on campus?

12:31.052 --> 12:32.914
I attended on campus.

12:34.075 --> 12:39.681
What was the general religious attitude of the students?

12:39.961 --> 12:42.504
Were they mainline Protestants, Catholic, Jewish?

12:42.524 --> 12:42.745
Why?

12:43.465 --> 12:45.548
I would say mainline Protestant.

12:45.568 --> 12:47.990
Do you remember any Jewish students?

12:48.070 --> 12:48.851
Yeah, oh yeah.

12:48.991 --> 12:49.632
How were they treated?

12:49.652 --> 12:52.035
We called every one of them, hey Jew, come here.

12:52.655 --> 12:53.196
They'd come.

12:53.480 --> 12:55.884
You know, and we loved them.

12:55.924 --> 12:56.645
Loved them dearly.

12:56.745 --> 12:57.827
We had one in an outfit.

12:57.947 --> 13:00.091
Did they think of that as a negative term?

13:00.471 --> 13:02.054
I don't think so.

13:02.074 --> 13:03.396
If they did, I would have.

13:04.017 --> 13:12.531
At the time, I mean, if you had somebody with a squint eye, you'd say, hey squint eye, you know, they were really cruel to each other.

13:12.571 --> 13:15.296
Children were really cruel to others.

13:15.316 --> 13:17.159
Were there some Hispanic students?

13:18.141 --> 13:18.441
Yeah.

13:18.995 --> 13:28.009
Chico Lozano, I remember we had in our outfit too and they gave him, unmitigated, they all about eating tamales all the time and all that.

13:29.311 --> 13:32.316
Now I eat more tamales than Chico ever ate I think.

13:32.997 --> 13:36.362
Were there any international students?

13:37.490 --> 13:39.633
There were, but they weren't in the outfits.

13:39.653 --> 13:45.541
They didn't go through the... But do you remember there being treated positively?

13:45.581 --> 13:49.427
No, I don't remember anything about the international students.

13:50.328 --> 13:50.749
Let's see.

13:50.789 --> 13:56.677
And the only time you were there in the summer for a student was during the war.

13:57.759 --> 13:59.121
You didn't go to summer school any other time.

14:00.122 --> 14:00.563
Is that right?

14:01.103 --> 14:02.265
At A&M?

14:03.038 --> 14:06.783
No, but I only had one summer, only one summer.

14:06.803 --> 14:09.246
And there were no women in those summer classes?

14:09.326 --> 14:09.527
No.

14:10.067 --> 14:12.190
Okay, but I know that later there would be, but not another.

14:12.350 --> 14:14.072
So you never had any classes with women?

14:14.093 --> 14:15.835
Never had any classes with women.

14:15.855 --> 14:15.955
Okay.

14:15.975 --> 14:25.628
All right, after the war, do you remember any of the, in that one semester in the fall, do you remember any important faculty members that caught your attention?

14:25.668 --> 14:27.410
After the war.

14:30.514 --> 14:31.716
Same one for there.

14:31.916 --> 14:32.016
Okay.

14:33.093 --> 14:41.465
Alright, so did you seek a job and if so how did employment and you get together?

14:41.485 --> 14:59.853
No, my father was in the insurance business in Houston with a large insurance company and he talked to me about coming to work there at that company and so I decided I'd try that out.

14:59.873 --> 15:01.395
Alright, you remember probably

15:01.780 --> 15:09.827
observing the others, what kind of job situation did the typical Aggie have right after the war?

15:09.847 --> 15:15.012
Well, a lot of the Aggies thought that life had passed them by.

15:15.052 --> 15:16.813
Really, seriously.

15:16.993 --> 15:18.595
I can't remember several of this.

15:18.615 --> 15:25.341
Judd and I, we have lasted three or four years here in the service and, you know, here we are.

15:25.581 --> 15:28.383
What chance have we got to really do anything?

15:28.403 --> 15:30.285
Several people thought about that.

15:30.653 --> 15:31.874
And I never did.

15:32.935 --> 15:35.318
Well, did they get jobs pretty easily?

15:35.338 --> 15:37.880
Yeah, they were all, everybody got jobs.

15:38.781 --> 15:42.304
My class did very well.

15:42.344 --> 15:44.987
Did the recruiters come to the campus to hire them?

15:45.287 --> 15:45.748
I don't know.

15:45.948 --> 15:47.249
Oh, okay.

15:47.269 --> 15:51.874
I didn't ever pursue that method, but I'm sure that there were some.

15:52.534 --> 16:00.542
You know, when you're in a big city, it's a little different from San Marcos and some of the smaller towns.

16:00.860 --> 16:01.881
They didn't know.

16:02.643 --> 16:05.807
Some of those guys that live on the farm didn't want to go back to the farm.

16:05.827 --> 16:10.093
So you officially finished in January of 47.

16:10.774 --> 16:11.315
Right.

16:11.335 --> 16:14.800
Was there a commencement ceremony?

16:14.820 --> 16:21.429
Yes, there was a commencement ceremony, and I did not go to it.

16:21.449 --> 16:21.710
Why?

16:22.811 --> 16:23.592
I don't know why.

16:23.733 --> 16:28.640
There was something else going on, and very few people that I knew did.

16:28.660 --> 16:29.601
Isn't that funny?

16:30.003 --> 16:32.969
Because I'm thinking of your nature now.

16:32.989 --> 16:33.450
I know.

16:33.630 --> 16:36.556
Oh, God, I wouldn't think of doing it well.

16:36.777 --> 16:40.585
But just think back in those days, what we had been through.

16:40.645 --> 16:45.615
War and the comeback.

16:46.827 --> 16:48.349
We didn't get our bids.

16:48.649 --> 16:51.312
We didn't get to a lot of things.

16:51.412 --> 16:53.995
And we got taken away.

16:54.896 --> 16:56.057
And we had to come back.

16:57.178 --> 17:02.264
And we were just thinking, well, we just need to get out and get started.

17:02.284 --> 17:04.226
And we were behind four years.

17:04.246 --> 17:13.757
As you are back, did you think about some of your classmates who weren't there?

17:14.377 --> 17:14.678
Oh, yeah, sure.

17:14.698 --> 17:16.039
Who couldn't come back?

17:16.059 --> 17:16.800
Sure.

17:17.422 --> 17:18.003
Sure.

17:20.345 --> 17:22.588
Sure.

17:22.608 --> 17:34.220
The, let's see, project houses, were they, who was in the project houses after the war?

17:34.240 --> 17:36.282
You remember those at Southgate?

17:36.302 --> 17:37.404
Were they couples?

17:39.406 --> 17:41.768
Back in the Depression, it was poor kids.

17:42.089 --> 17:42.429
Yeah.

17:42.489 --> 17:47.074
Well, were there any temporary, were there trailers and temporary,

17:47.695 --> 17:48.836
For married couples yet?

17:50.057 --> 17:50.578
Yeah.

17:50.598 --> 17:51.479
Where were they?

17:51.779 --> 17:59.066
When I came back, they were over in that area and just all around, wherever there was vacant lots.

17:59.206 --> 18:04.772
Some of the married students lived in trailers.

18:04.852 --> 18:08.055
Because the dorm rooms weren't that many.

18:08.536 --> 18:10.498
There weren't enough to go around.

18:11.398 --> 18:17.044
And we, somehow, I just looked down, I guess, in getting one.

18:17.395 --> 18:22.501
Now, where did y'all shop?

18:22.581 --> 18:25.484
Where did Sarah buy groceries?

18:25.905 --> 18:27.006
Well, from Smith.

18:28.127 --> 18:29.529
What's his name?

18:29.709 --> 18:31.411
Where was that?

18:31.431 --> 18:38.399
It was on the corner of what is now George Bush and the Easton Highway.

18:38.419 --> 18:39.000
Southgate?

18:39.600 --> 18:42.384
Yeah.

18:42.424 --> 18:44.466
There was a grocery store there.

18:45.273 --> 18:52.602
And if y'all, you and Sarah, after the war, if y'all went to eat out in metropolitan Brazos County.

18:52.622 --> 18:53.463
We ate out much.

18:54.925 --> 18:57.848
It was a hamburger somewhere, ate out at somebody's house.

18:58.749 --> 19:02.373
We didn't really, we didn't go out in a lot.

19:02.393 --> 19:06.999
And you married couples then, you didn't go to, or did y'all go to bonfire?

19:07.019 --> 19:08.901
Yeah, went to everything.

19:08.921 --> 19:09.822
Okay.

19:10.743 --> 19:11.905
Let's reach back now.

19:12.486 --> 19:14.588
Was there an Aggie bonfire before the war?

19:15.952 --> 19:16.433
Yeah.

19:16.453 --> 19:23.944
Where?

19:23.964 --> 19:27.469
I'm going to say the bonfire was where it is now.

19:27.489 --> 19:28.370
Before the war.

19:28.390 --> 19:31.254
I thought it was on the bill field.

19:31.675 --> 19:34.319
In front of the... Before there was an MSC.

19:38.705 --> 19:43.893
Well, what went into the bonfire then?

19:43.913 --> 19:44.794
What got burned up?

19:45.230 --> 19:45.891
What was there?

19:46.833 --> 19:49.116
Whatever you could find.

19:49.176 --> 19:53.583
Railroad ties or whatever you could find.

19:53.683 --> 19:58.231
It was not really an organized thing as it is now.

19:59.312 --> 20:00.594
I was not a member of it.

20:00.715 --> 20:03.880
I don't remember actually ever working on it.

20:03.900 --> 20:07.305
As a fish, you didn't help carry something?

20:07.842 --> 20:09.764
I don't remember doing that.

20:09.885 --> 20:11.106
I think I would have remembered that.

20:13.149 --> 20:13.870
Silver Taps?

20:14.711 --> 20:16.413
Oh yes, I remember Silver Taps.

20:16.633 --> 20:17.354
I remember that.

20:17.574 --> 20:18.075
Where?

20:18.616 --> 20:21.560
That was always at the academic building.

20:21.580 --> 20:24.063
Tell me about that.

20:24.143 --> 20:25.785
Describe that evening's routine.

20:26.486 --> 20:31.352
Well, it was at night.

20:32.767 --> 20:40.516
I want to say just before times I guess, at 10 o'clock, something like that.

20:40.536 --> 20:47.844
You know, time to study beforehand, then to go over there and everybody walked, you know, over behind the academic building.

20:47.864 --> 20:52.088
And it was, oh it was really a very moving experience.

20:52.289 --> 20:55.832
It still is, of course.

20:55.852 --> 20:58.095
That's a really wonderful tradition.

20:58.115 --> 20:59.737
Was there an Aggie muster?

21:00.458 --> 21:02.600
Oh yeah.

21:02.620 --> 21:02.740
Where?

21:04.070 --> 21:19.160
The Buster, we had in front of, I remember hearing the one on Corregidor.

21:20.122 --> 21:23.709
We had it on the radio.

21:24.230 --> 21:25.993
We got it in College Station.

21:26.362 --> 21:28.064
We could hear some of it.

21:29.305 --> 21:30.286
It was really something.

21:30.706 --> 21:31.587
Talk about that.

21:31.607 --> 21:33.949
Well, it was just exciting.

21:34.069 --> 21:38.033
They got a shortwave radio or something.

21:39.634 --> 21:52.366
I don't remember much about what was said other than the fact that this happened before we left, of course.

21:52.626 --> 21:55.609
Did you have any interaction with General Moore?

21:55.724 --> 21:56.085
No.

21:56.105 --> 21:57.648
Before he left to go over there?

21:57.689 --> 21:59.352
No.

21:59.773 --> 22:03.863
So you didn't know any of the people personally that were on Corregidor?

22:03.883 --> 22:04.344
No.

22:04.384 --> 22:07.411
No, I did not.

22:07.431 --> 22:11.019
Was that Corregidor broadcast played during?

22:11.721 --> 22:13.265
During a yell practice.

22:13.285 --> 22:14.247
Oh, during a yell practice.

22:14.267 --> 22:14.728
Yeah.

22:15.215 --> 22:20.501
We came up during a muster, and it could have been during a muster.

22:21.082 --> 22:22.944
I think it was during a muster.

22:23.024 --> 22:25.406
I said Yale Project, but I think it was during a muster.

22:25.426 --> 22:27.769
I think they had a muster at Corrigan.

22:27.809 --> 22:28.590
Oh, I know they did.

22:28.610 --> 22:30.812
I think that's what we got this.

22:31.513 --> 22:35.978
And because of the time zone, it was held there before.

22:35.998 --> 22:37.860
I don't know what time.

22:37.981 --> 22:44.648
Yeah, it was there, but at A&M it was at night.

22:45.100 --> 22:45.561
All right.

22:45.581 --> 22:47.383
Yelp practices were held where?

22:48.064 --> 22:50.547
YMCA.

22:50.567 --> 22:51.829
Right there in that little street.

22:52.390 --> 22:57.476
You wouldn't believe that everybody could get there, but everybody did.

22:58.017 --> 23:06.989
After a football game, what happened to... Yelp practices seemed like it was every night.

23:07.009 --> 23:10.453
I don't know how many Yelp practices a week we had, but we had a lot of them.

23:10.554 --> 23:13.217
There were more than one.

23:14.513 --> 23:20.239
But they were fun because we could get away from the sophomores and we could get our ass beat during yellow practice.

23:20.900 --> 23:25.986
All right, now, when you came back, the freshmen were all out at Bryan Field.

23:26.006 --> 23:26.266
Yeah.

23:26.727 --> 23:32.894
Did the campus seem more crowded when you got back in 46 than it was when you left?

23:34.135 --> 23:35.277
No, it didn't.

23:36.618 --> 23:43.626
But that Bryan Field, I don't know when that started, whether it was that way.

23:44.095 --> 23:49.303
I got back after I left and graduated.

23:49.404 --> 23:50.746
I believe so.

23:52.348 --> 23:58.859
They were trying to do away, the reason they were trying to do away with all that hazing.

23:58.879 --> 24:04.789
And they were getting the freshmen away and that was probably the worst thing that ever happened.

24:04.809 --> 24:09.917
And that was a terrible thing, you know, separating the students.

24:10.488 --> 24:17.398
The people that went out there, I don't know why they ever stayed there.

24:17.418 --> 24:18.219
Nothing out there that would be any fun.

24:18.239 --> 24:23.507
Let's see, I'm going through, we've already done court trips.

24:25.450 --> 24:27.713
Other places, did you ever go to Hardlickers?

24:28.935 --> 24:30.497
Yeah.

24:30.517 --> 24:32.140
Was that Mr. Ed's?

24:32.620 --> 24:33.101
Yeah.

24:33.121 --> 24:35.504
Oh, oh, so it's Ed Hardlickers.

24:35.524 --> 24:35.965
Yeah.

24:38.469 --> 24:38.689
Okay.

24:39.023 --> 24:42.546
You didn't ever have a, yeah, tell me about final review.

24:43.988 --> 24:48.552
It would be before your senior year, but what was it like and where, who came?

24:48.612 --> 24:54.217
Well, everybody was.

24:54.237 --> 24:54.938
Where was it held?

24:55.959 --> 24:59.942
In front of the MSC, before the MSC was there.

25:00.062 --> 25:04.026
In front of the Simpsons.

25:04.066 --> 25:07.309
About how long did the final review take?

25:08.707 --> 25:12.411
It took a long time, but I don't know.

25:12.731 --> 25:19.017
We didn't have anything else to do, so it was just a lot of ceremony, hurry up, wait.

25:19.118 --> 25:22.501
It was kind of getting ready for the Army.

25:23.802 --> 25:28.687
All of that was just so good for us because we didn't have any trouble with getting into the Army at all.

25:28.707 --> 25:30.509
It was just routine.

25:30.529 --> 25:34.713
That San Antonio experience was, Jesus, we loved killing.

25:35.254 --> 25:37.296
And Fort Sill was just

25:38.035 --> 25:41.759
except that I didn't have to worry about sophomores.

25:41.779 --> 25:42.580
You know, all of that.

25:42.881 --> 25:46.004
We had that routine down.

25:47.206 --> 25:54.514
But final review, I went through several of them and they were wonderful experiences.

25:54.574 --> 25:57.898
I can't really pinpoint anything.

25:58.739 --> 26:01.963
Was there any monkey business connected to the final review?

26:02.824 --> 26:04.306
No, not that I know of.

26:04.946 --> 26:07.249
Any monkey business with silver taps?

26:07.533 --> 26:08.274
No.

26:08.294 --> 26:09.055
Why not?

26:09.075 --> 26:10.057
Never.

26:10.137 --> 26:11.820
That was just a tradition.

26:12.841 --> 26:17.108
And I would dare say nothing but fun with you either.

26:17.128 --> 26:21.695
Those were just sacred, like going to church.

26:21.876 --> 26:24.720
That's the kind of answer that I wanted to give.

26:24.860 --> 26:26.924
That's what I assumed.

26:27.665 --> 26:30.149
Okay, let's see if we can generalize then.

26:30.169 --> 26:35.397
A&M had a student body that had some diversity in it.

26:38.735 --> 26:39.536
No blacks.

26:40.176 --> 26:44.941
No, but in terms of... We had some Hispanics, yes.

26:45.161 --> 26:46.223
Nice guys.

26:46.983 --> 26:50.287
And put up with a lot of stuff.

26:52.129 --> 26:58.635
What made that group inclusive?

26:59.056 --> 27:06.463
Was there something about whether you were rich or poor, country or rural?

27:09.751 --> 27:18.743
No, I remember this one particular guy in our outfit, the class of 43, actually was a year ahead of me.

27:18.763 --> 27:21.567
His name was Abe Wagner, a Jewish fellow from Houston.

27:22.608 --> 27:24.251
And nobody knew him beforehand.

27:24.351 --> 27:27.014
He didn't go to Lamar, he went to another school.

27:27.034 --> 27:31.380
But he was included in everything.

27:31.581 --> 27:34.625
They were crazy about Abe, but they called him a Jew.

27:34.685 --> 27:36.487
And they would look around and say, where's the Jew?

27:37.028 --> 27:38.610
You know, if he wasn't there.

27:38.928 --> 27:40.209
Hey, Jew, get over here.

27:40.490 --> 27:42.492
We're going to go do something.

27:42.732 --> 27:48.879
What made, because I've heard in other places like at the University of Texas, they'd be excluded.

27:49.260 --> 27:50.961
No, they were not excluded.

27:51.022 --> 27:51.222
No.

27:51.903 --> 27:52.924
Always included.

27:52.944 --> 27:53.364
I don't know.

27:54.465 --> 27:54.906
I don't know.

27:55.627 --> 28:05.097
But there was never a time that I knew of where there was any discrimination other than just in their language.

28:05.378 --> 28:07.500
I've always guessed what I was fishing for.

28:08.594 --> 28:10.196
Only one thing mattered.

28:11.578 --> 28:13.000
It was an Aggie.

28:13.020 --> 28:13.241
Yeah.

28:14.503 --> 28:18.448
Yeah, they were Aggies, so that's fine.

28:20.010 --> 28:22.494
Let's see, did you all ever talk about Highway 6 running both ways?

28:22.935 --> 28:23.896
Oh yeah.

28:23.916 --> 28:24.677
And what did that mean?

28:25.278 --> 28:32.248
That means you could get the hell out of there if you wanted to and if you didn't like what was going on.

28:32.268 --> 28:37.015
And we lost a lot of good students.

28:37.332 --> 28:38.273
We ran them off.

28:38.373 --> 28:40.676
We ran off a lot of good students.

28:40.696 --> 28:56.236
Alright, when you're getting ready to, you're approaching graduation now, you're newly married, what kind of world did you think you were entering?

28:56.256 --> 29:02.083
I was probably one of the most naive people in the world.

29:02.103 --> 29:07.069
I had absolutely no idea.

29:08.753 --> 29:34.552
And it was just one of those things that you just, I guess, when you look back at, when I used to worry about things in high school, about my future, what I would do, you know, have to do after a certain prom or something like that, some date or some girlfriend.

29:34.572 --> 29:36.876
When I got to A&M, it was all structured.

29:36.896 --> 29:37.697
I was told what to do.

29:38.639 --> 29:47.518
And then, until I got up to my senior bat, I didn't have to worry about what I was going to have tomorrow.

29:47.818 --> 29:52.007
Then I got to be a senior, and I was supposed to practice that,

29:52.308 --> 30:02.679
I got thrown into the army and I'm a second lieutenant and I'm still told every time I get up in the morning that somebody else tells me what I'm going to do.

30:02.699 --> 30:09.286
So I really never had any, I didn't have any time to plan my own destiny, my own future.

30:10.667 --> 30:21.218
Alright, as you left the campus and went into the real world, we'll call it, what, as you look back now,

30:22.919 --> 30:26.584
What did your having been at A&M mean for you?

30:27.525 --> 30:51.137
What did A&M contribute to your... Well, it just contributed to everything because my whole world was around A&M and A&M traditions, A&M functions and A&M people that I was totally dependent on.

30:51.623 --> 30:53.225
Every day, I saw them every day.

30:53.285 --> 31:00.672
We lived together, we ate together, slept together.

31:02.414 --> 31:05.657
A&M became just an integral part.

31:06.277 --> 31:13.865
What values and attitudes did A&M give you as you look back on that?

31:14.105 --> 31:21.192
I guess loyalty actually is probably one of the most, loyalty and

31:21.830 --> 31:23.503
friendships.
