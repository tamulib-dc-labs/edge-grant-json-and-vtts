WEBVTT

00:03.541 --> 00:16.716
We're in Clemson, South Carolina, sitting on the 
back porch that's now been glassed in of the home

00:03.541 --> 00:16.716
where Dr. and Mrs. Williams lived for a number of 
years while they were here on the faculty at

00:03.541 --> 00:16.716
Clemson. Mrs. Williams, would you please sum up? 
Margaret, would you please summarize for us

00:21.702 --> 00:31.493
briefly a sketch of where you all served before 
coming to College Station? Well, we had this back

00:31.513 --> 00:33.295
porch. from 1961 until 1966 before we moved to 
Austin, Texas. We thank this Commissioner of

00:43.159 --> 00:45.683
Higher Education. Here at Clemson... We lived in 
this house, but we came in the 40s. And he came as a

00:50.089 --> 00:52.172
faculty member. As an instructor. And he left as 
the academic vice president. And it had been

00:57.640 --> 01:00.063
delightful years of college. We raised our 
children here. And... lifelong friends.

01:08.977 --> 01:13.763
Well, you won't be testing now, so you don't want to 
push the recording. Tom, only two years when he was

01:13.783 --> 01:21.192
commissioner, and he worked in all the states and 
colleges in Texas. He worked with them all. Did the

01:22.213 --> 01:24.996
best he could with writing a program. He wrote a 
program for a plan, and when he finished the plan,

01:25.256 --> 01:30.302
he thought it was time to go. And at that time, he had 
some other offers, and one of them was

01:37.973 --> 01:46.847
Can you summarize for us how A&M and the Williamses 
came together? Who came to visit, and how, and why,

01:48.229 --> 01:52.356
as far as you know? The link with A&M. The board came 
to visit with you all. Oh, yeah. That was Ford

02:01.249 --> 02:06.057
Albritton,

02:01.249 --> 02:06.057
Mr. Chairman. Clyde Wells. That's the three I 
remember. There may have been others. You'd have

02:13.725 --> 02:14.907
to check into that. How long did they visit? They 
came in on Sunday and stayed through Monday as far

02:17.171 --> 02:23.360
as I know. All I can remember is I got them a room at 
the motel.

02:29.577 --> 02:55.568
uh couldn't you know plan for the country club 
because it was a monday i remember it was a monday so

02:29.577 --> 02:55.568
they had to eat at the hotel i wasn't going to feed 
them you know i hope you haven't left at all were

02:29.577 --> 02:55.568
there any uh were there any previous discussions 
between texas a m and y'all before that time had uh

02:29.577 --> 02:55.568
mr rutter and mr rudder had contacted jack before 
he died And since I wasn't privy to hearing that

02:57.033 --> 03:03.622
conversation, I know that he had said he would 
consider it. And then we got word that he had done

03:03.642 --> 03:06.486
it. And then he got word that these people wanted to 
come to see him. And he told me to make the

03:10.512 --> 03:12.695
arrangements. All right. Y'all came, I believe, 
November 1, 1970. He did. About how long ahead of

03:20.926 --> 03:26.854
time did this group come to visit y'all in 
Knoxville? I might even find a letter if I went

03:29.382 --> 03:43.863
through the file that he had written back saying 
that he believed in coordination, that the med

03:29.382 --> 03:43.863
school and the law school would have to work into a 
plan like that. I remember his saying to me that he

03:43.883 --> 03:59.305
also asked them to give him their backing to 
designate a dormitory for women beginning in 1971

03:43.883 --> 03:59.305
so that there would be a place for women to live on 
campus. Well, I knew that that happened. They even

04:02.902 --> 04:04.344
put in hair dryers. But that wasn't the first thing 
that was requested of him when he got there. What

04:11.571 --> 04:12.552
was the first thing? Well, the first thing was, we 
want you to fire the coach.

04:17.917 --> 04:25.024
And his answer was, no, you give them a year's 
notice. And the second was a request from the

04:25.725 --> 04:29.308
students who wanted girls in their dormitories, 
in their rooms, and his answer was, I have two

04:29.643 --> 04:47.510
daughters, you all are fine young men, I would like 
for my daughters to get to know you all, but not in

04:29.643 --> 04:47.510
your dormitory where there's no place to sit 
except on the bed. And that worked. Do you want

04:50.635 --> 04:52.097
that? Obviously he didn't. What similarity was 
there between Clemson, where you all had had a long

04:59.562 --> 05:03.227
experience, and Texas A&M. How were the schools 
similar? Lynn Grant. That's as far as I know, and

05:06.412 --> 05:12.740
both of them after World War II going co-ed. Did 
they have much school spirit? Yes. Were there many

05:18.669 --> 05:19.850
traditions? Not like Texas A&M, I don't believe. I 
don't believe the traditions here. This was a

05:26.647 --> 05:38.523
period when I was teaching school and raising two 
daughters, so you can see that I did my beauties

05:26.647 --> 05:38.523
with Jack's work, but you know, I wasn't. It was 
after World War II when things were growing and the

05:38.543 --> 05:42.588
faculty was new. I imagine they were very much 
alike, don't you? Oh, very, very. Like I tell

05:47.415 --> 05:51.220
people, they were both off the main highway a long 
distance from the state capitol where the other

05:52.583 --> 06:04.175
state university is, and that I assume that 
Gamecocks tell Clemson jokes the way Longhorns

05:52.583 --> 06:04.175
tell Aggie jokes. All the Aggie jokes go all over 
the United States because of the Aggie schools.

06:08.859 --> 06:09.620
Sure. The Morrill, Morrill, is that the name? 
Morrill Act. Act. And so they all were put out in the

06:17.588 --> 06:22.133
country because it was an Aggie school. Yeah. 
Among the key people that I know Dr. Williams

06:22.739 --> 06:29.110
worked with was John Calhoun. Yes, he was a gift 
from heaven.

06:35.462 --> 06:38.206
He couldn't have been more fortunate to have John 
Calhoun there. They had known each other

06:38.928 --> 06:40.551
previously. Jack had looked him up. Do you 
remember the speech? In the speech he told about

06:47.258 --> 06:51.084
Jack looking up because of his name. And then they 
knew each other when Jack was commissioner. And he

06:53.988 --> 06:59.977
had him that entire time as a loyal, talented... 
Turn it off and I'll tell you what I said about him.

07:03.442 --> 07:05.745
Don't say anything you don't want on here. We'll do 
that later. Say only the things you want recorded.

07:10.172 --> 07:11.394
Have you got it on? Yeah, it's on. Okay. John was a 
brilliant man. And his wife was lovely and very

07:17.195 --> 07:20.700
supportive of him. And I don't think that Jack 
could have been more fortunate than to have had

07:20.720 --> 07:26.208
John. And with the two of them, they put an academic 
team together that compared to none anyplace. And

07:35.522 --> 07:42.412
it wasn't one that they were known for the 
smallness of their team and how it all worked

07:35.522 --> 07:42.412
together. And I don't remember any conflicts. I 
don't either. I don't either. I don't remember

07:48.441 --> 07:52.406
anybody having any great uproar over anything. 
And the same thing happened with his staff in the

07:53.067 --> 07:56.592
office. Nelda Rowell. Nelda Rowell was, you just 
can't estimate how much she meant to Jack because

07:58.715 --> 08:10.191
she was willing to be an assistant and she knew what 
assisting somebody meant. It meant be honest with

08:11.173 --> 08:14.337
them and help them in any way you can. And she was as 
loyal as anybody I've ever known. If she ever saw a

08:20.722 --> 08:31.252
letter or an item that she thought might need a 
little more time or a little more review, what was

08:20.722 --> 08:31.252
her technique? Her technique was saying, Dr. 
Williams, I don't believe I would mail this today.

08:37.398 --> 08:38.479
What was his route? Let's make believe it's a 
typical Monday through Friday, and I know no day

08:38.959 --> 08:43.243
was typical. What was his average routine for the 
day? He got up about what time and did what in what

08:47.408 --> 08:53.818
sequence?

08:53.838 --> 08:55.400
Well, we had a pattern. We didn't have any servants 
in the house for breakfast.

09:01.669 --> 09:13.146
I cooked his breakfast, and I put a card table up in 
the kitchen under a light because the lighting in

09:01.669 --> 09:13.146
the family dining room, he couldn't read the paper 
by the chandelier. And so I put a card table up over

09:13.717 --> 09:21.529
one of the lights in front of one of the ovens in the 
kitchen. And I sat on the stool at the counter and

09:21.929 --> 09:24.453
ate my breakfast. And he sat at the card table and 
read the paper and ate. And we had that time

09:28.018 --> 09:29.961
together. And did he sometimes read news items to 
you from the paper? No, no. But we had that meal

09:35.329 --> 09:38.314
together. And if If he came home for lunch, we put 
our food on the tray and took it back to the office so

09:40.379 --> 09:47.368
it would be private. What time did he get up and do 
mail early in the mornings? He finished up

09:51.333 --> 09:53.436
everything at night. He wouldn't have gone to bed 
with something that wasn't dictated. And the

09:56.640 --> 10:04.170
office staff told Barry that he'd bring them in all 
these tapes and they'd type them up and then he'd

09:56.640 --> 10:04.170
hand them another set. But they never got caught 
up. But he had a happy staff as far as I can tell. It

10:10.552 --> 10:19.942
ran smoothly, and he didn't have anything 
unpleasant except one person that he didn't think

10:10.552 --> 10:19.942
was loyal. He didn't put that in there. Let's see. 
Melda, John Calhoun. Haskell Monroe. Haskell was

10:30.593 --> 10:37.420
the one, if you want to know anything, ask Haskell, 
because he has lunch every day with a different

10:30.593 --> 10:37.420
faculty member. And he knows everything that's 
going on. If you want some information, go to

10:39.714 --> 10:42.778
Haskell. You had a good way, Haskell had a great way 
of knowing what was going on on the campus. Thank

10:49.327 --> 10:49.527
you. Thank you. Dick Winerdi. Dick is a 
fascinating man. He has a lot of energy and

10:56.096 --> 11:06.090
enthusiasm and talent. He was recently, a year or 
two ago, he was the man of the year for Houston,

11:06.492 --> 11:12.219
Texas. And he is the person who should have the job 
as president, as far as I'm concerned, right now as

11:12.239 --> 11:25.073
president of the Texas Medical Center because of 
his many talents and his engineering expertise.

11:25.093 --> 11:33.563
When you all got to A&M, do you think Dr. Williams 
had any specific goals in mind for A&M? things he

11:35.433 --> 11:37.636
wanted to work on? He had so much experience with 
the Southern Association that he would have

11:38.518 --> 11:56.925
known, he was always a member on the commission of 
the Southern Association, and he would have known

11:38.518 --> 11:56.925
what all the universities needed to be because 
he'd been doing accreditations for all the

11:38.518 --> 11:56.925
universities, so he knew. Did he dream of a medical 
school, you think, when you all got there? Was

12:03.034 --> 12:04.917
that...

12:06.449 --> 12:11.615
visiting board members who came to interview him 
in Knoxville said they would like to have one. And

12:11.635 --> 12:18.483
his answer was, if it can come, as it should, 
through coordination, if the time can come. But I

12:18.863 --> 12:24.770
do believe in coordination, and we can all have 
everything we want. Describe, as far as you

12:26.272 --> 12:31.237
recall, how the A&M Press came to be. Who was it that 
got Wardlaw and Williams together? John Lindsay.

12:37.497 --> 12:39.139
Telephone call from John Lindsay. And he tells one 
story slightly different from mine because I

12:39.579 --> 12:47.870
wasn't in that conversation. I just know that Jack 
said that bring him in and that he was interested

12:49.592 --> 12:57.461
when John called. And when he did come to our house, 
he looked at the coffee table and he says, there's

12:57.481 --> 13:04.170
my book. And I have a book That was his first success 
book when he was editor of South Carolina

13:05.950 --> 13:14.318
University Press. And I've heard him tell the 
story of how they worked him into doing this. And it

13:19.043 --> 13:20.545
doesn't have his name in it. I had no idea that it was 
his book. And he thought I had put it out just for

13:23.868 --> 13:27.692
him. But the first thing he saw, and the name of it, 
he said he went to bed one night. He's going to bed,

13:31.456 --> 13:35.620
and he didn't have a name for his book. And he was 
going to press, and all at once he remembered a line

13:36.562 --> 13:45.315
from a poem by the state poet. Thank him who placed 
us here beneath so kind a sky. So he entitled his

13:49.080 --> 13:53.266
book Beneath So Kind a Sky. And it's a picture, 
historical

13:53.286 --> 14:04.763
picture and story of the old historic places in 
South Carolina. Let's see. I know that y'all were

14:08.607 --> 14:11.670
close friends of Buck Shewitz. Well, that was one 
of the nicest things that's ever happened to me was

14:12.691 --> 14:21.241
to know Buck Shewitz because he was one of the most 
interesting people I've ever known. You know, he

14:21.921 --> 14:22.962
was lovable. And Texas A&M, of course, he deserved 
them and they deserved him. Is that okay to say?

14:33.790 --> 14:34.771
Those two fit together. They do. They do. He was 
just a delightful character and a talent. Even

14:42.700 --> 14:44.722
with the sad things that happened to him. Now, he 
did a drawing or an engraving or whatever the

14:45.062 --> 14:57.036
proper artistic term would be of the president's 
house at College Station. A Christmas card. I had

14:57.882 --> 15:01.726
requested that he do a scene on the campus of 
students. Instead of that, he sat in a car for three

15:01.746 --> 15:03.988
days. Well, I wasn't in town then, and did this 
picture of the president's home. And when I saw it,

15:09.493 --> 15:12.396
I said, I'd like to buy it. And he said, you can't 
afford it. Then he gave it to me for a Christmas

15:14.958 --> 15:17.140
present. And when I left Texas A&M, I turned it to 
the university, and it's in their collection.

15:25.017 --> 15:30.864
Let's see, describe the campus as you recall it 
when you all first arrived. What were the

15:31.444 --> 15:34.247
important structures that were there? Well, the 
Rudder Tower was new. I remember the first evening

15:36.910 --> 15:46.381
with Van Claverin for our first opening of the, 
what was it? The Rudder Auditorium. The Rudder

15:47.623 --> 15:48.183
Auditorium. That was, to me, a very exciting 
evening.

15:54.278 --> 15:56.180
I remember Harold Dunn and Mr. I'm trying

15:56.200 --> 16:04.091
to think of the other name of the building. Kruger? 
Kruger. When they named that, both were pleased to

16:06.133 --> 16:10.359
have their name on that. I was the MC that night. I 
remember that. Polly and Mr. Dunn, well, that was

16:13.243 --> 16:16.126
nice. And both of them were just delightful people 
to know. And I'm glad that... that I knew so many of

16:23.388 --> 16:27.513
the people who had their name on the buildings. Mr. 
Pat Zachary, Mr. J. Harold Dunn. This means a lot to

16:31.779 --> 16:40.170
me to have known them and know that they were worthy 
of

16:31.779 --> 16:40.170
being honored in such a way. Mr. Evans. Describe 
Mr. Evans in personality.

16:51.004 --> 16:51.505
Shy. Hesitant, outgoing, good humor, what? I 
didn't know him that well. Oh, okay. I just saw him

16:58.335 --> 17:01.799
on occasions in the day of that dedication. He was 
in, I'm trying to think the name of his plantation.

17:09.388 --> 17:11.890
We got correspondence from him very often. Little 
Eva Plantation. He sold that a little while later.

17:17.036 --> 17:18.538
But I remember that. been heading on his 
stationery for that, and then I pushed her

17:18.805 --> 17:24.731
wheelchair the day of the dedication. And that the 
Friends of the Library organization was an

17:24.751 --> 17:34.883
outgrowth of the new library with his name. Do you 
know, does your trivia information recall why it

17:35.804 --> 17:41.710
was the Little Eva Plantation? I don't think I ever 
knew. That character from Uncle Tom's Cabin, is

17:47.037 --> 18:16.015
buried there little eva and for a while he 
transferred the title of that to a m and i was the one

17:47.037 --> 18:16.015
to try to worry about it and i was worried that some 
villain was going to get in there and destroy and

17:47.037 --> 18:16.015
thank goodness he came a few months later and said 
if you'll give it back i'll give you land in texas

17:47.037 --> 18:16.015
worth a heck of a lot more and so we very gladly made 
that exchange this man john lindsay you mentioned

17:47.037 --> 18:16.015
him Describe John Lindsay and your feelings about 
him. He and his wife are lovely people, of course.

18:23.300 --> 18:26.705
And it was obvious that he was interested in the 
university. And I think it's well known that he's

18:26.725 --> 18:33.014
responsible for the press. He had Frank Wardlow at 
his home. And he asked him would he be willing to

18:38.502 --> 18:44.871
start a press for Texas A&M. far as I understood he 
said he would. And so he called Jack and Jack said

18:47.423 --> 18:50.647
bring him in. That's the words I heard. Now I heard 
him make a speech and tell a funny story about their

18:52.270 --> 19:00.440
meeting over in Austin. Tell the funny story. Well 
the funny story was that Frank didn't want to be

19:01.822 --> 19:14.318
seen with the president of Texas A&M so they picked 
a small motel someplace that they weren't too

19:01.822 --> 19:14.318
happy to be They're meeting him, but they still, 
that way, Frank wouldn't be in any trouble for

19:14.517 --> 19:23.867
having a meeting and giving somebody the idea that 
something was going on. As far... I know why he

19:26.249 --> 19:29.313
wanted to leave. It was a period, and you don't have 
to erase this. It was a period when he was getting

19:32.056 --> 19:36.200
transferred to report from different people, 
wasn't it? That wasn't the story I heard. The story

19:38.763 --> 19:42.887
I heard, and we had the press right there. Back to 
this man Lindsey. What areas of A&M do you think

19:47.796 --> 19:51.460
John Lindsey was interested in? All of it as far as 
I'm concerned. He just was interested in A&M and

19:55.063 --> 19:57.546
wanted to help. And I was close to the press story, 
but he was just always there with an idea and

19:58.146 --> 20:07.656
supporting it in every way. But there were so many. 
Aggies that really love their university and are

20:11.538 --> 20:16.903
willing to do anything for them. But John stands 
out. He stands out and he's still there. He's still

20:21.147 --> 20:22.268
there trying to help. And Sarah was a good, 
interested person. She was supportive of him. And

20:29.554 --> 20:40.264
I don't know why he had any greater love or that he 
had any greater love for this university than a lot

20:29.554 --> 20:40.264
of the other performance students. But he never 
stopped. Trying to help. Buck Wirus. Well, I just

20:45.770 --> 20:47.273
love to hear him. He's such a good buddy. And he was 
good for Jack, and he traveled with Jack. And once

20:55.005 --> 21:00.354
he told me, you can right turn it on. Tell us about 
Wirus taking him to a high school to speak to some

21:00.735 --> 21:05.462
parents. Well, Buck told me that he told Jack, he 
said, I don't know what you can talk about having a

21:09.436 --> 21:16.444
barbecue in a high school gymnasium with people 
and their children are there. This is a family

21:16.504 --> 21:17.965
affair. And I don't know what you can talk about. 
And he said Jack got up and talked about the lessons

21:20.588 --> 21:25.073
of history. And he said he had complete attention 
from everybody. He just never seen anything like

21:28.597 --> 21:32.181
him getting up and giving them a history lesson. 
When I would hear Dr. Williams make speeches, I was

21:36.267 --> 21:51.123
always deeply impressed with his reference file 
in his brain of having an appropriate anecdote or

21:36.267 --> 21:51.123
story or illustration for that particular event.

21:52.564 --> 21:54.746
Did he have a file that he went through? Did he have 
them in a book? Where did he get all of those

21:57.229 --> 21:59.171
recollections?

22:03.636 --> 22:04.857
They were all stored away in his brain. They were 
there. He was, when he died, he had given a book to

22:07.530 --> 22:26.516
the President of the Medical Center Board, and on 
somebody the great, what's his name, the great?

22:29.180 --> 22:29.961
Frederick the Great? Frederick the Great, I guess 
it was. And he came in and he looked, and see where

22:31.964 --> 22:35.248
Jack was in his book. And he said, I've read more 
than he and Jack haven't finished it. But I didn't

22:40.457 --> 22:44.921
say, Jack's reading three books at a time. Jack 
never moved a book. He had a book where he would sit

22:47.323 --> 22:49.825
down or lie down. And he read the book that was close 
to it. And so Peter the Great is the name of it. Oh,

22:56.532 --> 23:01.036
OK. See how it probably takes me to get a name to fly 
up? What was Dr. Williams' relaxation? What did he

23:05.097 --> 23:08.901
do to ease off?

23:12.025 --> 23:13.666
He liked music. Okay. After his heart attack, even 
all the old movies would be on. He read books. Any

23:22.035 --> 23:23.958
particular variety of music? Well, he liked 
classical music, and you ought to see his music

23:26.000 --> 23:31.466
collection back here. You ought to see the 
collection where he's got a tape that he... He did

23:34.612 --> 23:38.476
everything the Reader's Digest at the university 
ever had and recorded it all. I even have

23:38.716 --> 23:50.850
recordings of him singing with the music and 
drumming with two pencils, the erasers of two

23:38.716 --> 23:50.850
pencils. He entertained himself by recording 
himself and singing. He was a drummer now, a drum

23:56.856 --> 24:02.222
major for the high school band, the drum and bugle 
corps. I have tapes where he just recorded himself

24:03.012 --> 24:06.015
doing that. He was the Drum and Bugle Corps drum 
major in Galax? Uh-huh, for the Drum and Bugle

24:10.300 --> 24:11.681
Corps. And the summer he went to college, before he 
went to college at 16, he went to Denver, Colorado

24:11.701 --> 24:22.473
for six weeks to train their Drum and Bugle Corps. 
Now he grew up in Galax? During that time he was

24:23.834 --> 24:25.296
there. His father changed him from BPI, where he 
had a football scholarship, Emory & Henry College

24:31.177 --> 24:38.124
and told him when he came through, Emory and 
Virginia would get off the train and his trunk

24:31.177 --> 24:38.124
would be there. He said, you've already broken 
your wrist and chipped your tooth and I don't want

24:39.145 --> 24:44.249
you playing football. So he changed him while he 
was away without consulting him. Why Emory and

24:48.854 --> 24:50.836
Henry? Do we know why Emory and Henry? Somebody 
came to see him and recruited him. And did he start

24:56.621 --> 25:00.525
out with a history major? No, he was pre-law. He was 
going to be a corporate lawyer. And this is an

25:05.343 --> 25:11.372
interesting story. He played tennis with the 
older men in town. He was a lawyer's partner in

25:14.097 --> 25:15.839
tennis. And he wanted to join his law firm, and so he 
was going to go into corporate law. And when he came

25:22.069 --> 25:30.141
back from World War II, he graduated and joined the 
Marine Corps December the 8th. It took them almost

25:31.319 --> 25:37.986
two years before they could place him in an altar 
transfer. So in the meantime, he started

25:38.006 --> 25:43.231
teaching, and they transferred him to a high 
school where he was a principal. And he had so many

25:43.251 --> 25:57.084
problems with the students up there in the 
mountain area that at one time he went into town and

25:43.251 --> 25:57.084
swore out a warrant for them and had them arrested 
and taken to the courthouse. And their parents,

25:57.144 --> 26:00.027
they were throwing snowballs with rocks at them. 
And he came back from World War II and said, I'm

26:01.660 --> 26:05.425
going into education. Men are needed in high 
schools. Men are needed for discipline. He went to

26:09.390 --> 26:12.393
Emory University and started in on education. And 
his professor said, you're wasting your time. If

26:15.657 --> 26:19.762
you will come and major in history, we will give you 
a scholarship. He didn't apply for it. And that,

26:22.306 --> 26:24.568
people change in your whole life. But Jack was an 
avid reader, always. He was methodical in

26:30.230 --> 26:32.453
everything he did. He kept good records. He threw 
everything away. He didn't clutter his life. How

26:39.122 --> 26:42.567
did he come to be a major in Southern history? 
Probably was a professor or something like that.

26:47.053 --> 26:48.655
It was social history. When Duke University 
interviewed him, they would have hired him if he

26:49.095 --> 26:58.448
had agreed to be a professor.

26:58.850 --> 27:03.655
take a tenure period and be a specialist in that 
period. And he said, no, I'm social history. How

27:07.399 --> 27:08.780
did he and Dr. Wiley? He was one of his professors. 
And they were good friends. They liked each other.

27:14.786 --> 27:22.373
And in one of the classes, he gave his students a 
copy of Billy Yank or Johnny Redwood. Johnny

27:22.774 --> 27:25.937
Redwood would have been first. And Jack, I 
remember him sitting there with that marking. He

27:32.789 --> 27:35.232
didn't know the slang for the military. This is one 
of the things that he had bad slang and things like

27:35.252 --> 27:42.760
that in it for the men. And so he corrected him. And 
he was the only one in the class that did. So that was

27:48.387 --> 27:50.769
it. Now, when did you and that young man meet?

27:57.220 --> 28:05.832
He went

27:57.220 --> 28:05.832
to college at 16. I went to college at 18. I'd been in 
West Virginia where they had another extra year in

28:08.756 --> 28:14.904
junior high. And he'd been in Virginia where they 
had one less year. So he was two years ahead because

28:17.888 --> 28:24.056
I'd had an extra year and he'd had one less than the 
normal folks. And I was there about, as a freshman,

28:27.410 --> 28:30.414
And that would have been in 38. I'm 18. I was born in 
20. Is that coming out all right? Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm.

28:35.181 --> 28:37.144
I've been there about a month. At? At what school? 
Henry Henry College. Okay. My daddy wanted me to go

28:41.931 --> 28:46.918
to a girls' school, and I told him I wanted to go to 
Henry Henry. And my brother is in the same

28:46.938 --> 28:53.007
fraternity, and he asked him to bring some skirts 
that I had left home to be in rehab. And he asked

28:54.148 --> 28:54.649
me... where I was, you know, ask somebody to tell 
him that he'd put them behind a standing mirror.

29:02.263 --> 29:08.771
And when I walked into dinner, we ate at different 
tables in the dining hall, and I walked in, he said,

29:02.263 --> 29:08.771
who is that? And he told me three or four times 
before the meal was over where they were. He

29:18.382 --> 29:23.488
started sending me flowers from his table every 
meal of them. He'd take a flower out of the vase and

29:23.772 --> 29:26.856
send it to me. And that was my freshman year, the 
first month or six weeks. But he broke the first

29:30.762 --> 29:33.245
date we had for a football game. He didn't have the 
courage to tell me that he was supposed to go to a

29:35.148 --> 29:42.078
dance at Virginia Univ. And he kept saying, well, 
you go to the first football. You turned that off, I

29:45.202 --> 29:46.143
hope. No, no, no. We want this. This is good. Oh, my. 
No, this is good. There's nothing bad about this.

29:54.262 --> 29:56.585
I'll show you how smart I was. You're a freshman, 
and he's a junior? And

30:00.551 --> 30:06.178
he kept saying, will you go to the first football 
game with me? And I said, yeah. And one day we were

30:08.521 --> 30:13.628
walking along, and the date came up, but when is the 
first football game? And it was a dead silence.

30:21.350 --> 30:27.019
Well, I already knew that he went to Virginia 
Intermont Dance, which is a girls' school in

30:21.350 --> 30:27.019
Bristol. And then he had a stag line because he was 
the only one that knew a certain dance, the shag.

30:33.930 --> 30:36.835
And so the girls lined up to dance with him. And this 
dance was the day of the, the next dance was the day

30:36.855 --> 30:44.607
of the football game, and of course he already had a 
date for it. But he didn't open his mouth. He didn't

30:46.891 --> 30:48.994
tell me he was going to break the date. He just 
didn't show up. But I knew when there was a dead

30:50.462 --> 30:53.325
silence that he wasn't going. So I went up and told 
all my friends that Jack was going to break a date

30:53.345 --> 30:57.450
with me. This was early in the year, first football 
game. So we went to it, and it never was brought up

31:01.655 --> 31:04.098
again. He acted like that evening never existed, 
and I did too. It was never mentioned. He never went

31:12.067 --> 31:15.471
to another dance at the Virginia In-N-Out. He 
started dating a preacher's daughter who hadn't

31:18.016 --> 31:22.370
really learned to dance and no, did really learn. 
But what I'm saying is he just kept quiet. That was a

31:27.667 --> 31:29.292
characteristic.
