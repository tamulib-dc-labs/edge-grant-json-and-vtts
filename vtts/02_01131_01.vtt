WEBVTT

00:06.173 --> 00:06.914
Well, it's not an issue. I was just curious. No, I 
don't really see it as being one. I mean, there's

00:09.376 --> 00:18.043
never been a problem with anyone pointing out to 
me, and I don't see the resonance as, you know,

00:09.376 --> 00:18.043
starting an uprising. I just don't see it that way. 
Okay, that's fine.

00:24.209 --> 00:25.470
You may not even have a feel for this. When you were 
mentioning earlier about the early days, and that

00:27.452 --> 00:36.079
you were going around in these almost one-on-one 
educational... This is something that came to me

00:36.633 --> 00:43.642
in my talk with Mr. Welles.

00:47.167 --> 01:03.028
Do you think that because of the environment 
created here in the woodlands, that the

00:47.167 --> 01:03.028
woodlands, this may seem obvious, but does the 
woodlands preselect for a certain type of

00:47.167 --> 01:03.028
personality, a certain type of personality? 
Someone with a built-in set of values.

01:09.086 --> 01:26.957
What I'm getting at is, obviously, people from 
Winslow, Arizona,

01:09.086 --> 01:26.957
who've been born and raised in Winslow, Arizona, 
may not share our affinity for trees, you know,

01:09.086 --> 01:26.957
because they have a different life experience.

01:29.958 --> 01:59.155
is part of the success of the Woodlands in that Mr. 
Mitchell, in his vision, has identified a

01:29.958 --> 01:59.155
set of values that appeal to a stratum or a type of 
personality or a type of actor that is different

01:29.958 --> 01:59.155
from, say, the person who moves to Kingwood or to 
any other surrounding. development, which is

02:00.063 --> 02:07.172
more consonant with things that are going on, you 
know, from west coast to east coast to anywhere. Do

02:08.374 --> 02:11.578
you understand what I'm asking? I think that I

02:11.598 --> 02:19.268
don't think you can just zero in on one individual 
aspect. I think it's everything that's going on in

02:19.568 --> 02:25.296
and around the woodlands has created a market. I 
think it's, you know, It's the school system. It's

02:31.133 --> 02:32.274
the hearty toll road. It's the community spirit 
kind of thing. But to zero in even more, I mean, once

02:37.099 --> 02:53.796
you realize that, hey, I've got all of these 
qualities, these things that I can't get, I think

02:37.099 --> 02:53.796
as a whole that all of us are probably more at peace 
with our inner self when we're in nature and close

02:54.113 --> 02:57.518
to nature. I just think that's a quality that we all 
have. Those that believe in God feel closer to God

03:00.562 --> 03:05.208
when they're walking in the woods. For families, 
they like to go to nature. They like to go to parks.

03:10.435 --> 03:11.697
They like to go to trees. And I just think it's, I 
think that aspect of what the Woodlands is all

03:11.717 --> 03:20.509
about is a strong, it's a strong card. But I think 
you can't just have a block of woods and expect

03:21.451 --> 03:25.155
everyone to move there. It's got to be easy to get 
there. It's got to be a quality of life. It's got to

03:28.378 --> 03:32.563
be a satisfaction that no one's going to be able to 
dump right next door to me. It's that planned

03:33.244 --> 03:35.426
community. So the package deal. The whole is more 
important than some of this. I think so. But I think

03:39.730 --> 03:44.375
the draw of the nature aspect of it is a real strong 
draw. Okay, I appreciate that. The last question I

03:45.757 --> 03:47.779
think you've probably already answered. and if 
there's something I should be asking you and I

03:48.653 --> 03:57.166
haven't because I'm not smart enough to figure it 
out.

03:57.787 --> 04:03.736
Could you comment a little bit on the future of the 
woodlands as you see it environmentally? Do you

04:05.278 --> 04:10.325
see, are there some things that keep you awake at 
night, that might keep you awake at night?

04:13.650 --> 04:15.613
No. I think, certainly not keeping me awake, I 
don't think we know the outcome yet of what it's

04:20.682 --> 04:24.988
going to be on the wetlands issue. It's a real big 
issue. What's that? I'm not familiar with that.

04:32.039 --> 04:34.182
I'm not that familiar with it myself, but it's... 
The definition of what is a wetlands and how that

04:36.666 --> 04:40.672
affects development in the wetlands? Exactly. 
President Bush made a statement and he's

04:42.395 --> 04:49.305
enforcing it through the Corps of Engineers and 
Fish and Wildlife that there be no no net loss of

04:50.180 --> 04:55.688
those areas that are classified as wetlands. And 
within a classification of wetlands, there's

04:56.749 --> 05:09.707
true wetlands that are wet, and there's things 
that are high and dry and growing pine trees that,

04:56.749 --> 05:09.707
because it has gray mottlings in the soil or 
something, may be classified as a wetland also. So

05:10.668 --> 05:20.001
I'm not sure what that issue, how that's going to 
play out in the future development the next 10 or 15

05:10.668 --> 05:20.001
years down the road. interpreted strictly as I 
understand it today, all developers are going to

05:21.179 --> 05:38.616
have a hard time finding

05:21.179 --> 05:38.616
lands that are not classified as wetlands in large 
enough blocks that it's going to be very expensive

05:21.179 --> 05:38.616
to develop. I think it's a big issue.

05:42.780 --> 05:49.566
I think,

05:42.780 --> 05:49.566
to me, the future of the woodlands is brighter than 
it's ever been. I just, so many things, many

05:50.845 --> 05:54.230
positive things are happening. But I just think 
the good times are, it's going to get better. We're

06:00.818 --> 06:11.673
just now beginning to see that the wilderness is 
getting large enough that it's going to

06:00.818 --> 06:11.673
perpetuate within itself more jobs and a better 
quality of living. It's going to make it even more

06:11.693 --> 06:15.538
attractive for more people to move here. So it's 
going to be, I would say, as long as it the economy,

06:18.115 --> 06:26.809
whatever that is, allows it to, it's going to 
continue to grow at the rate that it has in the last

06:18.115 --> 06:26.809
few years. I feel that. I'm certainly not 
qualified to make that statement. It's just a

06:33.140 --> 06:36.385
reaction. Well, you've answered the question. 
You're not worried about anything. The wetlands

06:39.650 --> 06:41.794
is an issue. You know, I sleep well at night, and I 
love my job, and I enjoy getting up and coming to

06:42.263 --> 06:47.309
the... I probably have the only job that's that 
great. Well, one of the advantages of your job is it

06:52.256 --> 06:56.942
gets done from time to time. You can complete 
something, and you can come back off and take a look

06:58.724 --> 07:01.427
at it. You can drive around and see, you know, some 
of the tasks around here are never-ending. And we

07:06.854 --> 07:08.877
get lots of strokes, you know. Yeah. Everyone 
likes to be involved in something that, you take

07:09.685 --> 07:18.179
something that's unsightly, it's a construction 
site, and you turn it into something that everyone

07:09.685 --> 07:18.179
appreciates.

07:22.886 --> 07:27.194
And they let you know about it, so it's a good 
feeling. In the absence, something else just

07:27.214 --> 07:33.043
occurred to me as you were talking, in the absence 
of...

07:35.977 --> 07:40.764
this codified environmental plan that we were 
mentioning earlier.

07:46.712 --> 07:47.834
George Mitchell is 72.

07:53.522 --> 07:59.250
The end of the woodlands is scheduled for sometime 
in 2020, 2030.

08:03.263 --> 08:13.734
Unless Mr. Mitchell is more extraordinary than I 
think he is, he probably won't be around to see

08:03.263 --> 08:13.734
the end of the book. He's very extraordinary. Go 
ahead. What I'm getting at, I guess, is when he

08:17.858 --> 08:27.128
should exit the scene for whatever reasons, what 
will happen to the book? Will it march on the same?

08:32.603 --> 08:36.689
Is the infrastructure such that it's got built-in 
resiliency? Or will some change unspecified

08:37.651 --> 08:42.638
occur? You know, what I'm trying to say is every 
corporation has its own culture. The Woodlands

08:49.828 --> 08:53.453
Corporation and Mitchell Energy and Development 
is very much the child of George Mitchell. I mean,

08:56.424 --> 09:01.191
his personality permeates everything that goes 
on around here. At least that's my sense of what's

09:01.211 --> 09:04.216
going on. When that personality leaves the scene, 
what's going to happen? It's going to be

09:09.944 --> 09:11.046
different. Well, I wish I had asked that question. 
I've thought about that often, and I think a lot of

09:12.288 --> 09:15.413
people have. But I think it's something I don't 
think anyone can answer that until we know more

09:17.227 --> 09:23.475
about who the players are going to be when he's not 
here. He doesn't have a strong influence on the

09:25.197 --> 09:30.264
women to this point. I think that's a good question 
and I hope we're around to see. Things may change.

09:40.377 --> 09:42.340
One of my fears is that, that we won't be able to 
maintain the character of Horace. We might not be

09:47.310 --> 09:52.822
able to maintain as I see it, as I feel it needs to be. 
Because without his influence, we might be weak.

10:02.823 --> 10:20.663
That's why I wondered, you know, when you 
mentioned, or that was actually the, why I asked

10:02.823 --> 10:20.663
that question is, if what you're doing is based in 
part upon folklore, you know, this is the way we've

10:02.823 --> 10:20.663
always done it, kind of thing, then what happens 
when, you know, you get hit by a truck or whatever

10:02.823 --> 10:20.663
happens, how does it continue on? Who knows what's 
going on? Where's the, you know, the

10:23.746 --> 10:32.796
institutional memory that's going to march on 
without the prison players? Is there a

10:33.147 --> 10:44.963
constitution and bylaws

10:33.147 --> 10:44.963
and, you know, and are the values, in fact, you 
know, written down, carved in stone, whatever, so

10:33.147 --> 10:44.963
that others... I think there are somewhat. I think 
we'll always save the trees and the woodlands

10:46.084 --> 10:54.095
because that's the way development criteria has 
messed it up. I mean, you legally cannot clear a

10:54.115 --> 10:58.481
tree off of your lot. Well, and the very name says 
that, too. I mean, yeah. It's not very subtle.

11:02.354 --> 11:06.440
Unless, let me finish, if it's under four inches or 
six inches. I mean, if it's over four or six inches.

11:09.424 --> 11:12.108
If it's under that, then it's debatable whether 
you can or not. So that's where all the... That's

11:12.329 --> 11:15.073
where all the tension is. That's where all the 
tension is, and that's where the debate is, and

11:15.093 --> 11:18.798
that's where the brush is. Some of us want to clear 
it all out, and some of us want to save it. That would

11:23.786 --> 11:25.929
be the only change, I think, after he's gone. I 
think the people that live here would be, they

11:25.949 --> 11:30.576
would, I think... rise to the occasion and battle 
the developer to whatever extent they could they

11:30.995 --> 11:59.331
tried to go the other way because of their concept 
of what the williams is all about because of their

11:30.995 --> 11:59.331
investment that they have here and a commitment to 
it i think it will so i i think it will it'll continue

11:30.995 --> 11:59.331
on maybe modify it somewhat to have a little bit 
more of a manicured look to it Okay. I don't want to

12:00.241 --> 12:06.066
take all your time, but I really appreciated your 
willingness to share your thoughts with me. Is

12:06.086 --> 12:09.689
there something I should have asked? I think you 
did a good job. I'm not looking for a grade. I'm just

12:13.432 --> 12:17.476
trying to get the information down that ought to be 
down. No, I think we've covered everything. I

12:22.801 --> 12:26.224
can't think of anything we've left out. Well, 
good. I appreciate it. Okay.
