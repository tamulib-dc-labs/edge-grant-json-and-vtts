00:01.533 --> 00:20.381
Okay,

00:01.533 --> 00:20.381
this effort

00:01.533 --> 00:20.381
lasted seven or eight years. And the toy. Trying to 
get into business for myself.

00:27.272 --> 00:28.914
American Marketplace, which seemed, you know, 
vast and full of opportunities. They had a

00:28.934 --> 00:29.315
product. But the actual development of the 
product turned out to be much more difficult

00:30.862 --> 00:51.072
because I assumed that companies would help in 
that they were interested in the development

00:30.862 --> 00:51.072
until I found out they were interested maybe in a 
finished new product, totally finished. So it was

00:51.092 --> 00:55.098
a struggle to come up with a finished product. I did 
have this fellow, Mike Dorsey, who inherited some

00:55.118 --> 01:00.126
money an esteemed attorney had introduced me and 
thought, why don't you get in with Mike and see if we

01:00.730 --> 01:09.701
can develop that idea. So we became buddies for a 
while and I did the drawings and the technical

01:09.721 --> 01:28.223
stuff, the layouts for the racket and then I would 
sub out the work to some machine shop and so forth

01:09.721 --> 01:28.223
and we'd come up with first crude models, and that 
wasn't good enough. We had to make another model.

01:34.665 --> 01:39.851
And it was a really tedious, fairly expensive 
process. And finally, Dorst didn't want any more.

01:45.559 --> 01:48.903
So I didn't do anything, because I usually had a job 
then. By then, I was in the mill business

01:48.943 --> 01:56.573
as an estimator in the wood business. And it 
wasn't, I was not in a necessary in a hurry. Nobody

02:00.654 --> 02:03.299
else was making any tennis rackets. So, but I 
always fool around with it and come up with a new

02:04.441 --> 02:15.118
model and I test it out, take it out to the courts. 
And one of the biggest problems was the cutting of

02:15.689 --> 02:23.000
the strings because of the sharpness of the edges. 
And that was very difficult to resolve. And then

02:25.123 --> 02:33.435
they come up with plastic strips and inserts with a 
nice black insert, by the way, which is the way they

02:25.123 --> 02:33.435
came out later on. And then Mr. Carson, who was a 
developer,

02:40.968 --> 02:41.329
Al? Al Carstens. Carstens. Let me see if I'm 
picking this stuff up. My terror, of course, is

02:47.618 --> 02:51.744
playing these things at a later time.

02:54.588 --> 02:59.315
And he was very interested in this project. He had 
plenty of successful developments in Teo. And so

03:04.782 --> 03:10.671
he wanted to put some money back, whatever cost you 
want to model, OK, let's make it up. And in fact, his

03:11.056 --> 03:19.265
father, who was 70 some odd years old, also thought 
the idea was great. He must have talked to him about

03:19.726 --> 03:22.309
it, you know. And he made us a model, the finest 
model that was ever made. It was made by Al Carson's

03:26.093 --> 03:29.737
father. He could get the holes cleaned. Nobody 
else could. The little birds were not there. No,

03:36.645 --> 03:38.808
the little birds were not there. He was from the old 
country. And, excuse me, and, but there was

03:42.152 --> 03:47.199
something came up. They did not want their father 
to do any more of those things. I heard, I got that

03:51.504 --> 03:53.146
impression. Don't bother, you know, I was really 
enthused when I saw that model that he made. He had

03:57.952 --> 04:00.115
no problem doing it. But I think a family matter 
came up and they didn't want their 77-year-old

04:00.652 --> 04:09.340
father working in a wood shop or wherever he was all 
day. So that thing kind of fell through. But we did

04:13.264 --> 04:14.645
make some models. We played with it. And I was very 
impressed with the power of it. I could see that it

04:18.429 --> 04:29.359
was going to be a much superior racket to wood as 
soon as I got the strings and about an ounce or a half

04:18.429 --> 04:29.359
an ounce overweight. and the balance corrected, I 
knew it was going to be a much better... I could see

04:34.525 --> 04:37.708
my serve was much harder right away. I served more 
aces, so I knew the idea was right. It was just a

04:44.015 --> 04:48.620
question of the technology and engineering. How 
did you take up tennis as a young man? What caused

04:53.345 --> 04:55.768
you to turn to tennis instead of soccer? The usual 
story. Ice skating. I had a curvature of the spine

04:59.327 --> 05:04.260
and my doctor said I had to do something to some 
exercise.

05:06.686 --> 05:08.390
But that was one part. The other part was my dad had 
bought me a violin and I I really was not too crazy

05:12.387 --> 05:15.751
about my violin lessons. So I traded in the violin 
for a tennis racket. And the first year I won the

05:21.818 --> 05:36.575
Junior Championships of Schweidnitz, which is 
not very much, but we had four courts and I won the

05:21.818 --> 05:36.575
Junior Championship and from then on there was no 
stopping me in the game. I mean, you start out

05:36.795 --> 05:39.238
winning your first tennis tournament, and the 
same happened to me in skiing. I won my first

05:42.382 --> 05:46.927
slalom, giant slalom. So, you know, you can't stop 
somebody when you get that kind of a start. Would it

05:52.033 --> 06:01.324
be all right to continue on a tennis tournament?

06:01.344 --> 06:02.025
Okay, more on a tennis tournament. Because it 
really was responsible for kind of major

06:02.045 --> 06:03.807
reconnection. Yeah. Oh, by all means.

06:07.417 --> 06:15.829
You

06:07.417 --> 06:15.829
were both together by this time.

06:25.823 --> 06:35.297
I did send in samples to Wilson, for instance, a 
sample, and they came back and said could you

06:25.823 --> 06:35.297
supply they would if you drop the price I think I 
asked twelve and they said ten ten dollars a

06:36.020 --> 06:57.117
hundred thousand which

06:57.502 --> 06:58.824
I got all involved. All involved in his enthusiasm

06:59.084 --> 07:08.137
because I thought it was a really creditable 
project. Great, marvelous. And he had these

07:09.919 --> 07:22.717
bonafide offers like from Wilson and he wrote to a 
head ski company and I don't know if you know much

07:09.919 --> 07:22.717
about aluminum tennis rackets or metal rackets 
but they are now. So this was the foreman and he had

07:24.339 --> 07:27.323
these prototypes. So right away I generated all my 
excitement and my energies and we were really

07:27.843 --> 07:40.481
pushing for manufacturing and you can tell you all 
the technical problems that were involved. But

07:40.501 --> 07:45.868
for then the next several years this went on.

07:47.232 --> 07:52.277
We formed a family corporation. Cheryl was 
married by that time, first married, to a young man

07:52.318 --> 08:01.327
who worked for a big advertising agency in San 
Francisco. And when Cheryl and Dave split up and he

08:02.048 --> 08:10.337
went around the world that way and she went the 
other way, he went to Australia. and we sent him off

08:10.621 --> 08:20.136
with, we had some beautiful stationary printed 
and the company name and a cable address and all

08:10.621 --> 08:20.136
this kind of thing. Dennis, I think, was probably, 
he wanted to do all of those things, but he always

08:23.547 --> 08:40.405
kind of hung back on the exposure part of it, all 
these trappings, you know, so he might want to talk

08:23.547 --> 08:40.405
about his feelings on that score. The part I wanted 
to get at was how we then moved, because of all this

08:40.425 --> 08:51.917
tennis activity, when we did make a major move 
then, it was to another setting, which was the

08:52.640 --> 08:54.742
racket. I just wanted to kind of bring that into 
some chronology. Because it was a major part of our

08:58.126 --> 09:04.733
energy for about five or six years when we were 
first married. Now that's the energy level up

09:04.753 --> 09:07.336
here. On the feeling level, when I look back on it, I 
can see how we devoted so much conversation,

09:07.356 --> 09:20.149
energy, emotional effort, everything was going 
into that tennis racket. along with other stuff.

09:23.437 --> 09:33.649
So there was never any time for questions like are 
coming, you know, what did you, my asking him

09:23.437 --> 09:33.649
questions like what did you do when you were 10, 
never came up. And I wonder if that was very

09:34.330 --> 09:41.859
probably some kind of deliberate smoke screen 
maybe. He'd always put something like that in

09:42.300 --> 09:44.262
front of me. What does that mean? We never got 
around to, I'm sorry you missed some of this. Yeah,

09:48.888 --> 09:49.208
I want to But there's so much energy, emotional and 
otherwise, devoted to something like a task

09:49.188 --> 10:03.245
rocket project that I can see why we never got 
around to talking about, like, what did you do when

09:49.188 --> 10:03.245
you were five or ten? How do you feel about that or 
something else?

10:09.252 --> 10:14.418
I

10:09.252 --> 10:14.418
think you're absolutely right. Exactly what it 
was. Concentrate on that one project. And if it

10:16.795 --> 10:21.473
wasn't that project, then the next project was the 
development of the Racquet Club. And then there

10:21.908 --> 10:25.491
was always another, you know, subsequent, 
whatever it was. Yeah, but look at all these

10:25.992 --> 10:31.176
successful millionaires in this country do the 
same thing. They have no time for their love life

10:32.017 --> 10:35.500
and they get divorced. So it is a, but it did serve a 
dual purpose, you know. I said I did it because I

10:42.486 --> 10:50.413
thought I could become independently wealthy or 
get a decent job anyway. What I was bringing up was

10:50.545 --> 11:03.198
then how we got from, because of the tennis racket, 
the interest in tennis, when we did make a move, was

10:50.545 --> 11:03.198
how we got to play in the long run. So it did help in 
the long run. Yes. How did you naturally go from the

11:07.063 --> 11:10.006
tennis racket? At the time, you were still working 
in the social working, right? No. No? No.

11:14.751 --> 11:15.672
Insurance company. I was an office manager for a 
major insurance company. Oh, I see. That may be the

11:20.599 --> 11:26.108
insurance company whose social security number 
showed up in your list. No. In Stamford,

11:26.268 --> 11:29.052
Connecticut. Oh, yes, right. I was with that 
insurance

11:30.214 --> 11:35.583
company for 10 years. In 1978, I took early 
retirement.

11:48.494 --> 11:55.464
Then we went to, um, then we went to, uh, Captive 
City. I, uh, well,

11:55.584 --> 12:06.600
I retired from office management. And I, um, took 
a, uh, became a field underwriter. I took the

12:07.642 --> 12:08.683
license as a candidate for underwriter. And went 
down to one of our, one of our risk-taking

12:08.703 --> 12:10.646
adventures. As he told you, we didn't have jobs or 
anything like that. Uh, we bought a house down

12:16.895 --> 12:17.556
there. Then

12:18.262 --> 12:23.110
we had the racket club, John. First at Beavers. We 
enlarged that into a racket

12:24.112 --> 12:31.525
club venture. Stayed there for four years. And I 
was doing my insurance on the side of the road.

12:42.443 --> 12:50.263
Yeah, twice, you know, as I said, you know, Wilson 
asked if I could produce $100,000 at $12. Well, I

12:51.105 --> 12:58.343
knew I couldn't, at least not, I simply did not have 
the numbers to... The numbers I had said $12, and

12:59.015 --> 13:01.579
they said $10. Well, that's a $2 loss times 
$100,000. It's just simply a $200,000 loss. Yes,

13:08.028 --> 13:09.550
yes. Which may be all right for some companies. I 
understand they do business that way to get

13:11.373 --> 13:13.516
started. And it would have been. A large company 
could have done it, and by the end of the first year,

13:15.398 --> 13:23.229
they could have easily knocked off to $2 or $3, 
whatever it took, and get it down. But as an

13:24.051 --> 13:27.215
individual working out of a garage, you can't do 
it. Mr. Carstens...

13:30.453 --> 13:32.356
I have no idea. Remember the fun we had designing 
the stationery, the logo? Yeah, we had a logo

13:36.603 --> 13:38.406
business. She was good kind of in that to create a 
business-like image, which I was not familiar

13:38.886 --> 13:48.021
with at the time. A logo for the tennis? For the 
stationery. FOR THE RECORD. OLYMPIA. IT REALLY

13:53.389 --> 13:53.770
DOES. IF YOU'RE GOING TO DO A MARKETING EFFORT, 
THEN YOU HAVE TO LOOK LIKE YOU ARE IN BUSINESS.

13:58.558 --> 13:59.559
SURE, SURE. SO HE DESIGNED THE LOGO, AND WE HAVE THE 
LETTERHEAD AND THE WHOLE THING. AND MR. CARSTENS,

14:04.387 --> 14:09.074
ABOUT THAT PERIOD OF TIME, IS I THINK GETTING, HE 
WAS JUST TIRED. YEAH. You know, give him what he's

14:10.717 --> 14:20.916
best, and that would, well, not a lot of money, but, 
you know, a significant amount of money for a small

14:10.717 --> 14:20.916
meeting. Yeah, he got tired, and Gene got tired. 
Well, he'll, yeah, I do. We've got to stop that,

14:27.288 --> 14:43.865
because it's always making these submittals, and 
they come back and they say, oh, that isn't quite

14:27.288 --> 14:43.865
right, that's not quite what we want, it's too hot, 
too long, too short, too expensive, too this, too

14:27.288 --> 14:43.865
that, and it just can't do it anymore. It's a kind of 
a continuous discouragement by him. It's been a

14:47.709 --> 14:50.372
lot of work. Did you ever check back on your wanted 
status? Did you ever wander into a post office just

14:56.583 --> 15:01.710
for the sheer reason of looking to see if the 
picture was up someplace? I would kind of look at

15:03.091 --> 15:11.121
the picture sideways whenever I was in there, you 
know, but I wouldn't linger very long. And did you

15:11.141 --> 15:13.144
ever see the picture up there? I saw it, but it had to 
be up there at one time or another. They all had seen

15:16.448 --> 15:17.349
it. Every cop in the country was in the standings. I 
don't know what the system was. Yes, they had. So

15:22.656 --> 15:23.838
they must have seen it. Yes, you were right to be 
concerned. It's... From what I understand about

15:26.266 --> 15:32.193
the FBI records, they made a real concerted 
effort. Yeah, they didn't want anybody setting

15:32.694 --> 15:35.617
any new records. Yes, yes. They wanted to keep that 
down. When, evidently, J. Edgar Hoover himself

15:38.681 --> 15:54.720
wrote across it in blue ink, said, Bill Tribble to 
me, that across your folder, just says something

15:38.681 --> 15:54.720
about, suggests in close investigation or 
something like that, H. which in blue ink means

15:55.291 --> 15:58.897
this is J. Edgar Hoover. And as I said in the notes, 
here's a man who went after Dillinger and didn't

15:58.917 --> 16:10.676
give up on anybody, and he closed the Gartner file. 
So they certainly were outlawed. Yeah. But I feel

16:15.044 --> 16:18.970
that this is all part of... if any were if anybody 
were to ask me if i were to write my book on how to be a

16:19.810 --> 16:43.185
successful fugitive i would say you must get 
yourself a better cover than just a name you know

16:19.810 --> 16:43.185
get into something invent something because 
while you're doing this all the concentration of

16:44.330 --> 16:50.427
the other people are focused on that thing, you 
know? Did it ever occur to you that if you did make

16:51.149 --> 16:56.905
ten million dollars on it, it would thrust you into 
the limelight? I noticed the businessmen don't

16:58.488 --> 17:02.712
get into the limelight too much. They stay. They 
can stay back. They can have other people out

17:05.375 --> 17:08.818
front. The richer they get, they don't have to. You 
want to tell them about another person who helped

17:11.141 --> 17:16.446
you speaking? What's that? Walter. Walter helped 
you. Oh, Walter Keel? Yes. He should be in your

17:20.550 --> 17:23.874
lifetime somewhere. Okay. at the place where I 
taught tennis after we started this club. Give me a

17:33.403 --> 17:34.688
feeling of the year. 74. No, excuse me, I think 
you're from 70 to 74. From 70 to 74, you were an

17:40.546 --> 17:42.107
actress. We split from Palo Alto. Right. So we had 
the

17:44.430 --> 17:50.657
peninsula kind of thing. But mostly my kind of 
taking charge of the situation and doing these

17:50.677 --> 17:58.125
things, he went along with the hives. Right. Hives 
and all. Hives and all. Understandably, sure,

18:00.858 --> 18:09.967
because we just do at that age to just sort of just 
dump everything and just pick up and go. Then... If

18:11.648 --> 18:21.437
I was a citizen, I think it would have bothered me 
much less, you know, because you could walk into

18:11.648 --> 18:21.437
almost any place and get a job eventually, you 
know. But, you know, my job, I'm limited, highly

18:21.457 --> 18:29.785
limited to just a few areas where I... apply and 
qualify. I mean, you can always get a job somewhere

18:32.041 --> 18:39.710
and fake it for a couple of weeks, which I did long 
enough and then I would like to do. Once you get

18:39.970 --> 18:44.415
married, you can't say every two weeks I got a new 
job. Did you ever have to join a union? No, I stayed

18:46.978 --> 18:47.859
away. I felt that was another area I didn't want to 
get into because I had to go to meetings.

18:55.988 --> 19:04.345
dues and who knows, maybe strikes and ticket lines 
and things like that. So I stay away from all that

19:04.505 --> 19:06.032
stuff. I mean, they made good money in my area, like 
in construction. And I, in a sense, wasn't a union.

19:13.262 --> 19:15.024
I was a mason, you know. I mean, and they have some 
sort of guild in Germany, the carpenters. Yes,

19:20.993 --> 19:21.593
here too. They have guilds, you know. But that is a 
little bit different. No, I felt I wanted to get

19:29.364 --> 19:31.347
into it. I didn't... i want to get into some kind of 
management

19:38.092 --> 19:43.558
Anyway, we got this, we started that racket club. 
It was going real good on these two courts. It was

19:46.501 --> 20:03.559
going so well that the Teamsters who owned the 
whole Kitten Taboodle of 500 acres, the golf

19:46.501 --> 20:03.559
course and the two tennis courts, and then the 
vacant land that we wanted to sell the lots on, But

20:04.973 --> 20:18.155
there was a good idea maybe if they moved us from 
where we were into, let's build a bigger racket

20:04.973 --> 20:18.155
club and really do it up into a land promotion. So 
they... took the list, probably, that we had of the

20:22.203 --> 20:33.400
members, and got enough money from the bank, who 
happens to be a tennis player in our club. His name

20:33.620 --> 20:41.251
was Walter Field. He had just opened up the bank in 
Watsonville, nearby.

20:50.165 --> 20:51.707
He had sold some banks. The story was he had sold 
some of the United Banks. Anyway, one of these rich

20:55.151 --> 21:04.063
man's sons who, you know, he didn't have anything 
really fun to do, so he... He would come from

21:04.083 --> 21:09.831
Watsonville and play, and he would hire me to play 
with him. You know, it just wouldn't take any work.

21:11.413 --> 21:13.395
Officially it was a lesson, but he was good enough. 
I went to Stanford. So we'd have really hard tennis

21:15.967 --> 21:18.431
matches. And he enjoyed

21:20.054 --> 21:24.001
that. He had me up to his place. He built a tennis 
court and he owned a small mountain. Lovely place.

21:33.318 --> 21:34.600
Vineyards. Just a perfect little mountain, you 
know. And his estate was on top of it. And then he

21:40.073 --> 21:42.035
built his new tennis court. And he had me give 
lessons to his new wife. Fairly new wife. One of his

21:49.283 --> 21:50.544
wives, yeah. And he raised it. I didn't know. I 
didn't know. I didn't mean to. Yeah. But very

21:56.730 --> 21:58.572
lovely lady. And he's a former school teacher. 
And... So

22:03.706 --> 22:14.122
we became good friends, as friendly as you can get 
with a banker. And we wanted...

22:14.562 --> 22:31.187
Oh yeah, we didn't have enough money to buy any of 
that lot that Jean wanted, which she found, which

22:14.562 --> 22:31.187
was as close to the ocean as she could come. So... We 
had a little money, and I told him one day, I said,

22:33.929 --> 22:40.638
how much we had, and he said, where's the lot? And we 
told him where the lot was, and the next day he said,

22:41.959 --> 22:47.486
okay, how much money do you want, Dennis? We drove 
out there, and he said, the couple of things that he

22:48.267 --> 22:54.115
said to you that you remembered... kind of that 
influenced you? How much do you want to do? What do

22:58.123 --> 23:01.587
you want to do, Dennis, to drive yourself crazy? 
You wanted to bankroll in the lot, the house we

23:02.408 --> 23:09.517
subsequently built, and another racket club. But 
there was one story that you tell about how you

23:09.998 --> 23:20.851
played in the tournament with him up at the 
Stanford Club, or University Club at Stanford,

23:09.998 --> 23:20.851
about this fear of exposure. Oh, yes. That was a 
very traumatic thing. So he wanted me to play in his

23:25.297 --> 23:34.166
alumni tournament

23:25.297 --> 23:34.166
at Stanford. And we were winning. We were doing 
fine. We got to the finals. And we had to wait an hour

23:38.211 --> 23:40.153
or so. I was a little tired, and I walked around the 
clubhouse that they had. And I looked up, and I see

23:46.319 --> 23:53.447
that they have a plaque for all the winners every 
year. And I knew. And when I came back down, I

23:57.626 --> 24:01.050
couldn't hit a ball. Because I didn't want my name 
and his name up there forever and ever. And have him

24:07.237 --> 24:11.802
find out that I didn't want to dishonor him. That's 
the way I was. I was totally froze. I could not hit

24:16.128 --> 24:19.231
the simplest tennis ball. We lost the final. So the 
name didn't go up. I hope someday Walter Field can

24:25.388 --> 24:29.513
become aware of why he lost that tennis 
championship. I'm sure he could have, you know, he

24:29.533 --> 24:33.658
could have killed, well, he could have cared less. 
He was the man who wanted to win the tennis

24:34.279 --> 24:38.684
tournament. But that kind of thing got him. Oh, I 
had to lose another one. I lost another one just

24:44.771 --> 24:46.093
like it. The finals of the B Championships of 
Northern California, which is a fairly big ranked

24:47.374 --> 24:53.401
tournament. Finals, same thing. Lowell said, 
this is the worst I've ever seen you play. Well,

24:59.872 --> 25:03.096
every time I tossed the ball up, I thought I saw my 
picture on the paper.

25:05.999 --> 25:09.043
So I double faulted. I mean, you know, just like 
this.

25:13.468 --> 25:16.732
And outwardly, you were trying to hit the ball, but 
inside, no. Yeah, you were actually two people at

25:16.752 --> 25:19.255
that time. No, sure. Just off the letter. Yeah, you 
were just pulling and pushing at the same time.

25:24.482 --> 25:25.703
It's not very pleasant. I would have had no problem 
winning. In addition to it, you don't even play.

25:33.429 --> 25:35.471
I'm sure I never played as well as I could. Very 
subtle. You cannot exceed that. You have just too

25:40.915 --> 25:43.698
many things going against you. You have too many 
things on your mind, and you always know that if

25:43.718 --> 25:48.542
you're too successful, you're becoming too 
visible. You don't ever play your best. Every once

25:51.725 --> 25:53.126
in a while, you'd have flashes. Where you let 
yourself go. Like, very early, as I started once,

25:57.475 --> 26:11.869
when I went to Palm Springs from Hollywood, that 
was in 1949, that year, because I went over there to

25:57.475 --> 26:11.869
look, just out of curiosity. I did see Elizabeth 
Taylor across the street. And I became a custodian

26:17.154 --> 26:26.503
shortly for the Racquet Club, Palm Springs 
Racquet Club, which was temporarily closed, and

26:17.154 --> 26:26.503
Mrs. McManus who owned half of Palm Springs, hired 
me as a custodian. Mrs. McManus? Mrs. McManus. She

26:32.867 --> 26:34.709
owned half of Palm Springs. A grand old lady. She'd 
walk around with her cane and tell the gardener to

26:37.354 --> 26:43.463
cut the branches so the peaches were different. So 
I got to play tennis. She said, I could teach

26:46.918 --> 26:49.481
lessons, give lessons if I wanted to. Just sleep 
there so that there's security. She felt that. She

26:54.485 --> 26:55.607
had me up to her house. And then she checked me over. 
And she probably couldn't figure me out. And

27:00.932 --> 27:08.419
one day Tilden came around. Bill Tilden came 
around and asked me if I wanted to play an

27:10.001 --> 27:14.445
exhibition match.

27:16.771 --> 27:18.093
He says, I'll let you win. He says, I won't 
embarrass you. I'll let you win. He came with his

27:21.617 --> 27:24.161
boyfriend. Introduced me to his young fellow. And 
he was going with it. He was in his 60s. And I would

27:31.551 --> 27:32.772
have loved to play. He could have beaten me six 
love, six love. I would have loved it. But, you

27:37.478 --> 27:41.564
know, picture in the paper with Bill Tilden. I just 
wasn't ready. I would have loved it. How did you get

27:45.391 --> 27:47.855
into a thing with Robert Stack?

27:52.842 --> 27:58.631
I didn't realize that I worked at Sugar Bowl that 
early, so I had to be 47, 48.

28:01.615 --> 28:13.913
Now that I look at the thing, because if I worked for 
Bill Klein, I worked, there must have been even 46,

28:01.615 --> 28:13.913
because before I worked for Bill Klein, I worked 
for Sugar Bowl, so they never turned me in when I

28:01.615 --> 28:13.913
worked for them. Because Bill didn't know I could 
ski. He saw me ski that year when I was the fry cook.

28:22.786 --> 28:27.801
He saw me ski and then the following year gave me a 
job.

28:28.844 --> 28:30.226
And that was delightful. First of all, I told you 
the security feeling that nobody was going to come

28:30.647 --> 28:35.255
in there and look for you. Yes. And second, this 
bartender was a Hollywood extra. He kept me in

28:39.964 --> 28:41.126
stitches. He was so funny with his Hollywood 
mustache and his cigarette holder. and his jokes

28:46.495 --> 28:49.699
about Hollywood. He knew a lot of people. You know, 
he was just absolutely, really a great guy, and

28:50.641 --> 28:54.386
entertaining. I hope he ever made it. I kept 
looking for him in any movies, but I never saw him.

29:00.013 --> 29:00.795
Do you remember who he was? What his name was? I 
can't remember his name, but I'm sure he could be

29:02.337 --> 29:09.767
found in the records, you know, because if they 
kept the records that long, you know. What was his

29:10.508 --> 29:11.089
name? The Sugar Bowl Corporation. Yes. And 
anyway, one day... And you were Peter Peterson?

29:17.467 --> 29:18.268
No, I had to be. I had to be Dennis. I don't think I 
switched my name, I'm not sure. So I had... Peter

29:24.395 --> 29:30.441
Peterson had to be a very short, short life, you 
know. Maybe one year, maybe, when I went up with

29:32.464 --> 29:38.751
this Arkansas family. Right. And then I switched, 
probably. And in comes this guy and asks for a

29:43.482 --> 29:47.288
milkshake and a hamburger. And somebody goes, 
this is Robert Stack, Robert Stack. Well, I didn't

29:51.134 --> 29:51.975
really know who it was. All I knew was they said it 
was a movie star. So, I mean, Medin was the nicest

29:55.380 --> 29:58.946
guy. I did know, because he was really a tough, what 
did he play? Elliot Nest. He did play Elliot Nest,

30:04.575 --> 30:06.217
but that was much later. Much later, so I couldn't 
have known. He played Air Force officers. Yeah.

30:12.575 --> 30:15.038
During the Second World War. He was the most 
charming guy you can ever imagine. Friendly, you

30:18.683 --> 30:21.827
know, the common touch kind of thing. And you knew 
his brother, too. And his brother would come in.

30:25.231 --> 30:28.496
Jim, much better looking than Bob Stack. 
Dark-haired, and he would come up with these

30:28.716 --> 30:32.681
gorgeous women. They had a place, they'd towel 
nearby, so they would come by and ski a little bit

30:33.282 --> 30:40.071
and make a little trip. And did you get your picture 
taken together? No. Oh. But I did get to ski with him

30:42.764 --> 30:46.588
one day. I was off, and I happened to be on the slope 
when he was there. We took a few runs together.

30:55.998 --> 31:03.045
And then later on, we ran across him in a celebrity 
tennis tournament, you see. Oh, that's right.

31:03.706 --> 31:04.827
That's right. And did he recognize you, or did you 
reintroduce yourself? Well, I reintroduced

31:07.590 --> 31:10.813
myself. Took us to lunch. Took us to lunch. We sat 
there. With Rosemary, his wife. Rosemary and...

31:17.412 --> 31:21.678
Herb Cain came by, said hello. Yeah, but the other 
lady that was there, the wife of the

31:21.738 --> 31:26.545
ventriloquist. Oh, yeah, Edgar Bergen. Mrs. 
Bergen. Mrs. Bergen was

31:29.810 --> 31:35.097
there, too. Then, to again illustrate, I mean, 
names to her. What city was this in? rolling hills

31:40.780 --> 31:58.873
summer and this

31:40.780 --> 31:58.873
was about what year celebrity

32:00.912 --> 32:03.737
We had the club then. Yeah, and we were going to all 
the celebrities. He would play as a professional

32:08.546 --> 32:13.114
and you'd play with celebrities. Or we'd have 
those kinds of events at our club. Or we'd go down to

32:15.739 --> 32:18.684
Pebble Beach. We went to Eastwood and his friends. 
murph griffin all the time hangs out there oh so

32:23.812 --> 32:48.148
that when we moved later to hawaii in 1974 before we 
got jobs or anything we had a little money that we

32:23.812 --> 32:48.148
sold our property that we built on in monterey and 
we didn't have so for the first six months we were

32:23.812 --> 32:48.148
there we looked around for things to do and he 
volunteered to run a celebrity tournament. So

32:50.270 --> 32:52.773
this is on Milwaukee now.

32:57.258 --> 32:57.378
Right. Cool Lima. Cool Lima Resort, which is now 
Turtle Bay. And it was the James McArthur. James

33:05.206 --> 33:06.027
McArthur. Yes, yes. Tournament. So then Dennis 
was the tournament director, and he played, he and

33:08.309 --> 33:14.055
Lloyd Bridges, didn't you win? Yeah, we played a 
match, yeah. So now again, being involved, lots of

33:16.040 --> 33:23.198
picture taking, lots of writing and everything. 
it always seemed to me that he was basking in this

33:24.713 --> 33:27.918
kind of thing. I never got any kind of sense of fear 
or apprehension. It was no more, more, more. Mike

33:34.487 --> 33:37.271
Mannix, what's his name now? Mike Connors. You 
know how many people are going to pick up this book

33:38.573 --> 33:43.761
and say... But, you see, as long as there are no 
professional photographers, some guy with a

33:43.781 --> 33:52.073
little camera can take all the pictures he wants. 
See, I knew that You have to have certain types of

33:54.548 --> 34:04.658
pictures before the... You have to have very sharp 
pictures before anybody will publish it in any

33:54.548 --> 34:04.658
national magazine, because I'd already been shot 
down with my pictures. So I knew that it isn't that

34:05.639 --> 34:07.381
easy. You can take a lot of pictures. It takes a long 
time before you get anything published. So if

34:12.986 --> 34:18.892
somebody comes with a little camera, take all the 
pictures you want, you're not even going to look at

34:12.986 --> 34:18.892
them. So it's very, very fluky. It had to be a very 
fluky thing. Well, how do you think Lloyd Bridges

34:24.130 --> 34:28.014
would feel if he knew you played this? I don't know. 
I will certainly apologize for any... 38 years on

34:29.055 --> 34:33.900
the FBI list. What? I didn't hear that. 38 years on 
the FBI's list. What Lloyd Bridges is going to say.

34:41.288 --> 34:42.349
You've got to see those pictures. They're 
perfect. We have an old album. Is that right? Oh,

34:45.773 --> 34:46.294
yeah. But these are all the cameras. You see, 
they're not... professional photographers.

34:52.081 --> 34:58.327
Yeah.

34:59.227 --> 35:00.749
If they really set out their minds.

35:05.033 --> 35:06.154
I remember that. He was skiing, wasn't he? She 
played that one. That's right. It was a skiing, a

35:15.603 --> 35:18.246
hunting lodge accident or something. Skiing 
accident. I think the sixth shot was the one that

35:19.025 --> 35:26.395
accidentally killed him. The sixth shot 
accidentally killed him. We have a good lawyer.

35:33.464 --> 35:35.287
Not even very good looking. Oh, and Joanne Fluke, 
she was out. Yeah, the guy from the monkeys. Oh,

35:42.413 --> 35:46.860
you've got to send me some of those photographs. 
Any guy from Mission Impossible, the

35:46.880 --> 35:51.067
good-looking guy? Oh, yes, yes. Peter Graves. 
Yeah, Peter. And Al Harrington from the Bible

35:54.353 --> 35:59.101
Show. A lot of people. Yeah. They play tennis 
together. And he has the pictures. So what's the

36:05.018 --> 36:06.220
purpose of this? You just suggested a whole new 
title for the book, something like Hiding Out in

36:06.240 --> 36:10.446
the Open. Hiding in the Open. Well, this is part of 
my idea that I mentioned. It was that I feel that I

36:17.836 --> 36:23.624
was making my life fun, you see? And that's why I 
said... There was, you know, it was only downhill.

36:29.488 --> 36:33.193
If I turn any of this over to somebody else, they're 
going to screw me up for sure. Why would I ever let

36:33.233 --> 36:39.322
anybody touch, don't even touch me? You've heard 
that expression, you know, because you're just

36:39.603 --> 36:46.813
going to foul me out, you see. Because you've had 
different lives. It was like a roller coaster.

36:52.736 --> 36:55.460
There have been a lot of different lives. A life as 
an inventor, a life as a picker, a life as a tennis

36:56.101 --> 37:03.371
player, ski instructor. You've had whole 
different lives. You literally shed the skin.

37:08.919 --> 37:10.542
Enter a new name. Fortunately, on a graph, it looks 
like it's all going up. On a graph, it's getting

37:14.753 --> 37:16.976
better and better. They were all fun. I try to 
string the good days together, because that's the

37:19.119 --> 37:28.571
way I teach these young kids how to play tennis, or 
anybody. You string good shots together. One good

37:32.617 --> 37:34.760
shot does not do it. Oh, yes. Did you ever have a 
traffic ticket or a... action yes one early with

37:41.264 --> 38:07.693
Bill with her Lipkin greatest guy in the world 
gives me this job and sends me out and gives me all

37:41.264 --> 38:07.693
this self-esteem and confidence you know he puts 
in me and gives me a car you know and the only

37:41.264 --> 38:07.693
experience I had was my dad made me or gave me a 
opportunity for a driver's license without, we

38:08.703 --> 38:12.011
did not have a car. He just felt I should have a car 
because I was, he looked ahead, you know, he knew I

38:12.231 --> 38:20.310
was going to need some experience. There was a 
Plymouth with a shift, you know, and, uh, In

38:27.991 --> 38:33.600
Berkeley, the streets are tough anyway, and sure 
enough, I just barely escaped being killed. And

38:34.241 --> 38:39.450
somebody bounced off my front end because I simply 
was not an experienced enough driver. But I got

38:40.531 --> 38:41.994
away without it. I think there's a funny story. 
About what year was that? When you were the farm

38:46.621 --> 38:49.226
laborer and you were hitchhiking. Yeah, 
hitchhiking. Way before that. Yeah,

38:53.232 --> 38:53.813
hitchhiking. Because they pick you up because 
they want relief for driving. You go thousands of

38:57.386 --> 39:02.594
miles from one state to another, or from 
California to Oregon. They expect you to drive.

39:06.179 --> 39:09.163
Did you ever go to the East Coast, by the way? No. All 
the time you've spent has been on the West Coast.

39:12.407 --> 39:15.872
East Coast, you went to sell the baseball game. 
Just a baseball game to New York and right back. I

39:19.577 --> 39:21.380
had a round-trip ticket. I could not wait to get 
back. I could never make it the way I could make it in

39:24.269 --> 39:31.055
the east.

39:31.075 --> 39:33.137
But it was a lesson to have. I went up to the 
purchasing department of Woolworth and present

39:33.438 --> 39:39.463
my toys and my things. I was

39:39.563 --> 39:44.969
trying to figure out how this thing works. Did you 
have other toys besides the baseball toy? I

39:52.265 --> 40:00.653
developed a little line, yeah, from some of the old 
European kind of toys that I hadn't seen around

39:52.265 --> 40:00.653
here. Some spin things that I hadn't seen for a long 
time, spinners and stuff. Now back again, I see

40:07.660 --> 40:16.689
them advertised on TV because they get reborn with 
new colors and new material type things. So I had a

40:16.709 --> 40:19.331
catalog and everything. What did you call the 
line? Do you remember what you... Did you have a

40:21.728 --> 40:23.971
name for the company or a name for the line? What did 
we call us? I don't know whether we called us

40:28.496 --> 40:31.820
Olympiads, whether the toy line was... I have to 
ask Jean, because she was in on the tail end of that.

40:37.106 --> 40:42.072
It had a nice catalog printed up, but it never took. 
In fact, some of these professionals back east

40:42.153 --> 40:49.221
that saw me, the purchasing guys, they would... 
You have to be able to deliver. Did we, in the toy

40:53.038 --> 40:58.507
line, did we call it Olympiad or was it the toys? You 
were not in on that. Was my toy line before that?

41:04.957 --> 41:08.723
Yeah, so I don't remember what we called it. So 
Olympiad was the company's name for the aluminum.

41:11.408 --> 41:13.491
For the tennis rack. So you got a ticket? When the 
accident with the appointment? So I didn't get

41:19.105 --> 41:22.150
into any trouble with the judge, is what I'm trying 
to say. I was extremely fortunate that nobody

41:22.170 --> 41:25.355
really got hurt. It couldn't have been very, very 
serious. And that was it. That's the only problem.

41:33.734 --> 41:36.198
traffic accident that I was ever in. Maybe I had a 
bump or something. And I won the speeding ticket in

41:40.866 --> 41:50.582
Hawaii, and I remember whipping out, I always kept 
Gene's picture in a bikini right next to my

41:40.866 --> 41:50.582
driver's license. It distracts him. Yeah, very 
clever. Very clever.

41:58.000 --> 41:59.922
We'll use that picture on the card. That's right. 
Where is that picture? I left it at home. Remember,

42:04.287 --> 42:05.849
you made me change wallets. It's all your fault. Is 
that right? It makes me throw things out. I didn't

42:09.413 --> 42:10.794
make you throw it out. I like that picture, but I 
don't know. Yeah, it's in another wallet, but it's

42:13.217 --> 42:17.942
a very good picture. Excellent picture. And it was 
designed, put there, to keep you distracted from

42:18.883 --> 42:22.167
the driver's license. Yeah, I left it open. i don't 
do these it's not all that deliberate but it seems

42:23.937 --> 42:51.632
to these things work out it's not it's not all that 
calculation behind it it's it i don't know it must

42:23.937 --> 42:51.632
be unconscious or whatever it is these funny 
things keep happening these these coincidences

42:23.937 --> 42:51.632
they keep happening to me like we're talking on the 
way out with these celebrities you know i play in a

42:23.937 --> 42:51.632
celebrity tournament with three celebrities and 
these little boys come by want my autograph and

42:51.967 --> 42:55.571
These three celebrities are down the fairway, and 
I'm still signing autographs. And I have to run

42:55.591 --> 42:57.933
down to catch up with them. Or this Hollywood actor 
at the Kahala Hilton saying, are you Rod McDowell?

43:03.419 --> 43:04.921
And I said, no, but I know you. I said, I've seen you 
in many movies. And this is the conversation where

43:08.245 --> 43:12.950
we're looking at the dolphins going up and down. I 
mean, unreal. Were you going to tell a hitchhiking

43:15.753 --> 43:17.995
story? Oh, yeah, about the driving. So they expect 
you to drive. This one guy, you know, I took over the

43:21.987 --> 43:28.808
truck and he watched me drive going over these 
mountains, these ridges, you know, you can't...

43:29.092 --> 43:31.074
It was just before the freeways, you see. And you 
can't pass on these mountains. And I didn't

43:33.517 --> 43:34.438
probably. I passed at the wrong time, trying to be 
too aggressive driver. And he just absolutely had

43:38.302 --> 43:41.345
a fit and said, no, no, no, no, no. Just move over. 
Don't drive. Let me drive. It was the first time

43:44.868 --> 43:46.870
you'd ever driven a vehicle. Probably an American 
vehicle. I was just lucky that I didn't kill myself

43:48.933 --> 43:55.900
or anybody else. So there again, if you're not 
lucky, You know, any of these things can just

43:58.184 --> 44:03.675
simply turn into disaster. Oh, sure, sure. So 
somebody has to watch over you while you're doing

44:05.298 --> 44:08.905
all this.

44:11.370 --> 44:14.015
Did you... See? Yeah.

44:18.584 --> 44:20.007
In helping to raise... Mark and Cheryl, did you get 
the feeling that a lot of the lessons you learned

44:20.746 --> 44:27.718
should be passed on to them? Absolutely. And that 
they could do things better if they listened to you

44:29.921 --> 44:36.633
and understood why you're saying that. 
Absolutely. But you had to hold back some of those.

44:39.037 --> 44:45.167
Oh, no, just the lessons, the discipline lessons, 
and the concentration, and the that it takes to be a

44:46.075 --> 44:50.400
fugitive. It takes concentration. You know, pay 
attention to everything you do at all times. And as

44:59.391 --> 45:03.316
it turned out, as a side benefit, that is the only 
way to live. You cannot walk around and daze and

45:04.577 --> 45:09.863
think about other things all the time. You have to 
concentrate and be aware of where you are, look

45:09.944 --> 45:15.390
behind you, It's just good common sense. To be a 
fugitive is a very healthy, you become a very

45:18.578 --> 45:24.404
healthy animal. Strangely enough, I'm sure some 
experts will disagree with me, but your senses are

45:25.966 --> 45:34.635
totally sharpened at all times. So you're very 
tired, but you're also very on and off, on and off.

45:43.180 --> 45:45.104
Your circulation is excellent. Yes, yes. And in 
the evening before you go to sleep, you recount

45:46.848 --> 45:50.956
what could you have done wrong that might have... 
Yes, your conversation, everything. Your eyes,

45:54.123 --> 45:58.091
you see everything, which helps you become an 
artist. You can paint because you learn to see

45:59.433 --> 46:03.602
everything. So it's just a sharpening and it's

46:04.561 --> 46:13.322
recommended highly.
