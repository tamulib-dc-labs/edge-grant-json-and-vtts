00:03.153 --> 00:09.281
Describe the routine of getting... The band was, I'd like a fresh coffee, please, if you would.

00:09.521 --> 00:10.122
Want a little fresh coffee?

00:10.142 --> 00:11.424
No, I'm doing fine.

00:11.444 --> 00:12.926
And a little cream and sugar for me.

00:12.966 --> 00:14.187
Well, you all got the cream and sugar over there?

00:14.207 --> 00:15.249
Yes.

00:15.269 --> 00:20.416
The band, as I said earlier, was extra demanding, particularly in the fall.

00:21.757 --> 00:27.725
And I was going to try to swim on the swimming team, swim, the band, and study, and I couldn't do it.

00:28.006 --> 00:29.127
I wasn't up to doing all those.

00:29.950 --> 00:37.342
Later on, I might have been, but I was still learning to study that freshman year, so the band took so much time, I said, I'm not happy with this.

00:38.363 --> 00:41.788
Y'all worked out five days a week?

00:42.089 --> 00:44.132
Five days a week, two hours a day.

00:44.152 --> 00:47.678
I mean, the band took extra, extra time.

00:48.599 --> 00:54.388
A young man named Ed Cooper was a sophomore, junior.

00:54.638 --> 00:59.929
Well, the ones I remember, of course, were Jim Eller and Cooper and my fish buddies.

01:00.009 --> 01:03.096
I stayed friends with them anytime you go through the freshman year.

01:04.499 --> 01:12.937
I was friends with those guys, but I became similar friends with the sophomore buddies because you're not that much different between a freshman and a sophomore down there.

01:13.258 --> 01:14.841
It's a little better, but not a lot.

01:15.091 --> 01:17.153
I remember Ed Cooper, but I don't remember him well.

01:20.577 --> 01:24.322
What about core trips that first year?

01:24.342 --> 01:25.163
Oh, they were fun.

01:25.183 --> 01:26.124
Where'd you go?

01:26.144 --> 01:31.090
We went to, I think the first year went to Austin and Fort Worth, as I remember.

01:31.110 --> 01:32.051
And that was a great place.

01:32.091 --> 01:34.013
How'd you get there?

01:34.153 --> 01:35.975
In the band, I guess we went in the bus.

01:36.896 --> 01:38.859
Later you had to hitchhike.

01:38.879 --> 01:40.420
Then later on I finally got a car.

01:40.661 --> 01:42.843
But we went in the band bus.

01:43.024 --> 01:44.305
When you all marched down?

01:44.993 --> 01:46.975
Congress Avenue or wherever.

01:47.716 --> 01:50.319
How did the people on the sidewalk respond?

01:50.399 --> 01:51.420
Mixed.

01:52.681 --> 01:54.603
Austin was the worst place to go.

01:55.484 --> 01:59.489
And you'd always have a bunch of them picking on men in uniform.

02:00.329 --> 02:01.711
There was always a lot of fights there.

02:01.731 --> 02:04.614
And they were always outnumbered.

02:05.235 --> 02:06.977
So Austin was a little bit intimidating.

02:07.217 --> 02:08.318
Everywhere else was fast.

02:09.445 --> 02:16.118
And describe the routine for a freshman band member on football home game Saturday.

02:16.618 --> 02:18.181
Got up and did what all day?

02:20.846 --> 02:21.568
He probably had.

02:22.149 --> 02:25.896
I can't remember if we practiced that morning or not.

02:25.916 --> 02:30.264
But most of us, we had to march with the main band.

02:30.505 --> 02:32.348
But maybe not everybody every time.

02:33.374 --> 02:58.268
then you had to march into the band you know if it's an afternoon home game and you were pretty well occupied with you had other stuff you had military activities saturday morning before the game i don't remember what they were so much but you were you didn't have time off saturday and then you went to child and you marched to the game and after the game you were generally free unless you were walking the bullring i walked the bullring

02:58.248 --> 02:59.871
all my freshman year.

03:00.933 --> 03:03.458
And some of those drowned out, some of that stuff I started early.

03:03.498 --> 03:04.801
I had a little too much spirit.

03:05.602 --> 03:09.830
My freshman year, actually, I think I had the first three weekends.

03:10.191 --> 03:14.599
I didn't walk it when I went on a court trip, but after that, I walked it the whole time.

03:15.982 --> 03:18.086
Did you have any dates that first year?

03:18.387 --> 03:19.108
Not really.

03:19.983 --> 03:29.575
The guys that had girlfriends closer to home, like they were Houston or Fort Worth, they might have some girlfriends coming down, but I never had a date until junior, I think.

03:29.595 --> 03:32.598
And so, well, I just didn't.

03:32.618 --> 03:41.830
We had, I think one time we had a bunch of girls from high school, a friend of mine coming down, and we played kick the can by an old abandoned church there when we were sophomores.

03:41.850 --> 03:43.552
We were pretty innocent those days, I guess.

03:45.154 --> 03:46.936
The MSC, brand new.

03:48.158 --> 03:49.399
It was a haven.

03:50.324 --> 03:53.488
It was a haven when you weren't on the bullring or somewhere else.

03:53.508 --> 03:58.053
But they did keep us busy, and obviously that's the right thing to have done, too.

03:58.073 --> 04:02.898
But it was new, and it was impressive, and it was kind of like heaven in a way.

04:03.279 --> 04:04.781
It was the place to go.

04:05.181 --> 04:11.108
But the post office, we had that old post office that's still open at the north gate.

04:11.128 --> 04:12.830
You went to get the mail.

04:13.491 --> 04:15.673
We didn't get to go to MSC very often.

04:15.738 --> 04:16.579
for whatever reason.

04:17.139 --> 04:18.160
Maybe it just wasn't time.

04:18.921 --> 04:28.551
In fact, I remember my senior year, I'd go to MSC and eat and study sometime just because I'd never gotten too much before then.

04:28.571 --> 04:32.475
And Guyon Hall was... It was open, yeah.

04:33.055 --> 04:39.502
And we had, there was occasional movies, but the movies at Guyon Hall, that was more sophomore and junior years.

04:40.763 --> 04:45.508
But because I was campused and walking to Bullring, I couldn't even go to the movie because you have to go sign in.

04:46.282 --> 04:49.233
I was involved indirectly in the theft of the Baylor bear.

04:50.216 --> 04:50.397
Oh.

04:50.578 --> 04:56.680
And so I never got a hold of the bear, but I was one of the group that was trying to, and we all got campus.

04:57.723 --> 05:00.609
And so you couldn't even go to the movie.

05:00.629 --> 05:04.696
You go halfway to the movie and then you have to go sign in and you miss part of the movie.

05:04.776 --> 05:08.504
Being on campus probably made it more miserable than otherwise.

05:09.786 --> 05:11.028
Walking the bullring.

05:12.611 --> 05:14.034
That took care of my spare time.

05:15.016 --> 05:15.216
All right.

05:15.236 --> 05:17.441
You were doing all this studying in your room.

05:17.521 --> 05:18.162
Yeah.

05:18.496 --> 05:21.240
Describe your room and what was in it that freshman year.

05:21.280 --> 05:22.582
Well, those rooms are still the same.

05:22.622 --> 05:23.663
They're a little bitty room.

05:24.244 --> 05:24.985
They were efficient.

05:25.526 --> 05:27.749
You had a lavatory like here.

05:28.089 --> 05:29.952
You had double bunks on this side.

05:30.753 --> 05:33.617
About five, six feet over here, you had a lavatory.

05:34.478 --> 05:41.027
And then you had a desk on each side of the bed and one beer drawer between you and one closet.

05:42.323 --> 05:43.686
I think one closet.

05:45.008 --> 05:48.375
But we didn't have a lot of clothes, and you had all mostly military clothes.

05:48.435 --> 05:52.142
And you sent the laundry, so it was adequate.

05:52.162 --> 05:53.124
It was always hot.

05:54.366 --> 05:58.754
In the winter it wasn't, but spring and fall, it was hot.

05:59.175 --> 06:00.037
No air conditioning.

06:00.097 --> 06:01.800
You could have a fan.

06:02.472 --> 06:03.914
So that room was work.

06:03.934 --> 06:08.420
I mean, when you're in the room, you were sleeping or studying, and that was about it.

06:08.440 --> 06:11.704
A little bit of BSing, but not that much.

06:12.165 --> 06:22.018
As you look back on those, particularly those first two years, where were the Aggie students from?

06:22.118 --> 06:25.723
What kind of geography and income background?

06:27.265 --> 06:29.087
I think it was probably fairly varied.

06:30.637 --> 06:37.120
They were a lot from the cities as they are today, San Antonio, Houston, and Dallas.

06:38.433 --> 06:39.514
A few from Austin.

06:40.235 --> 06:43.840
I think there was probably more boys in agriculture then than now.

06:44.521 --> 06:48.786
I think we had a much larger rural makeup of smaller towns.

06:48.806 --> 06:50.488
West Texas, South Texas.

06:52.771 --> 07:02.143
Even at that time, we had a good many Hispanic boys, which I had always been pretty good friends with Hispanic guys, and so that was a good mix.

07:02.183 --> 07:05.487
They had a few that had military backgrounds, their parents.

07:05.467 --> 07:15.920
But a lot of ags and engineers, that's basically what we were then, not nearly as broad a base school and a lot of small towns.

07:15.940 --> 07:25.973
I imagine 40-50% were small towns, which was probably the demographic makeup at the time, where today I imagine it's probably 80% large towns or more.

07:25.953 --> 07:35.544
Now, I think I know the answer to this one, but did the student's family background income matter much as to whether or not he was?

07:35.584 --> 07:36.285
No, it never did.

07:37.327 --> 07:38.848
I guess that's true in the military.

07:39.589 --> 07:50.202
If you look at the military, it truly integrated the black people into the service, and so they did such a beautiful job of doing it because ranks were the classification.

07:50.702 --> 07:52.905
Outside of your rank, there's no other.

07:52.885 --> 07:56.368
Now, almost everybody had a nickname, didn't they?

07:56.448 --> 07:57.049
A lot did.

07:57.709 --> 07:58.430
A lot had nicknames.

07:58.830 --> 08:00.192
A lot came with nicknames.

08:00.272 --> 08:02.093
Nicknames were more popular then.

08:02.774 --> 08:05.576
In my dad's day, everybody had a nickname.

08:05.596 --> 08:07.298
In my day, a good many had.

08:07.778 --> 08:08.579
What was yours?

08:09.240 --> 08:10.321
Mine was Clady always.

08:10.601 --> 08:14.164
At Fort Stockton, they called me Maria Gonzalez, but that was another story.

08:14.284 --> 08:16.606
But did you become Clady at A&M?

08:16.666 --> 08:17.547
No, I was always Clady.

08:17.567 --> 08:18.628
You were Clady when you got there.

08:18.828 --> 08:20.410
I didn't have another nickname there.

08:20.590 --> 08:22.892
But a lot of people had nicknames.

08:22.872 --> 08:25.503
Most of them they brought with them, as I remember.

08:27.933 --> 08:33.034
What about the typical A&M students' attitude toward work?

08:34.027 --> 08:37.333
They had a good work ethic, and I think they still do.

08:37.934 --> 08:38.716
I think they still do.

08:40.299 --> 08:42.803
I taught school there for six years, from 83 to 89.

08:42.843 --> 08:48.694
There was a few that go to sleep, a few lazy, but mostly they were there to get an education.

08:49.536 --> 08:53.082
And they came from working backgrounds, by and large.

08:53.062 --> 08:58.428
All right, now, you're there as the Korean War is getting started.

08:58.509 --> 09:00.751
The Korean War broke out at Christmas.

09:01.272 --> 09:03.635
About the time we got to school, it broke out.

09:03.755 --> 09:07.439
And then the Chinese came into the war about Christmastime.

09:08.721 --> 09:13.847
And so that was another burden that we had that other young men have had.

09:13.867 --> 09:15.309
Do we stay in school?

09:15.349 --> 09:16.791
Do we go ahead and join the volunteer?

09:16.811 --> 09:20.115
And I think most of us said, let's get a commission.

09:20.155 --> 09:21.256
Let's go ahead and finish up.

09:21.296 --> 09:22.157
And that was...

09:22.137 --> 09:29.149
the attitude that we took, and I think most people took, which maybe is one less notch patriotism than my dad's age.

09:29.870 --> 09:31.453
When there was war, they volunteered then.

09:32.515 --> 09:33.877
In our day, we said, well, let's go ahead.

09:33.897 --> 09:34.619
We're in the military.

09:34.639 --> 09:35.200
We're training.

09:35.220 --> 09:41.310
Let's get our education first.

09:43.703 --> 09:54.737
Coming back, bringing the freshmen back to the campus, put everybody in the same routine so that every freshman and sophomore was in the Corps.

09:56.560 --> 09:59.483
Except the vets, returning vets were not.

09:59.503 --> 10:00.805
And they lived over in?

10:01.306 --> 10:02.027
They were scattered.

10:02.087 --> 10:03.248
Some lived off campus.

10:03.268 --> 10:08.835
They had some dorms for vets that were across the parade field from where the MSC is now.

10:08.855 --> 10:11.719
I forget the dorm, but there were a number of vets there.

10:12.644 --> 10:17.890
And then the vets also had the housing out on the way to Bryan.

10:18.010 --> 10:20.933
That's all been torn down, but there were a lot of vet housing in that day.

10:21.493 --> 10:25.377
What did you and your buddies do the first year or so for a good time?

10:26.579 --> 10:32.485
Well, we'd go try to leave town, which I didn't get to do because I was campus that first year.

10:32.865 --> 10:38.331
But we'd go to Fort Worth, Dallas, Houston, or wherever you had high school friends generally.

10:38.902 --> 10:42.668
Most guys went to visit their high school buddies at what school they went to.

10:42.788 --> 10:46.393
So I went some to Austin to visit with some of my friends at the University.

10:48.096 --> 10:53.003
Fort Worth, there was some girlfriend, not girlfriend, but friend girls kind of at Fort Worth.

10:54.145 --> 10:55.787
And that was fun.

10:56.168 --> 10:57.650
The court trips were a good time.

10:57.710 --> 11:02.117
Of course, you know, if you'd have some time off, you'd go have a beer bus somewhere.

11:02.157 --> 11:02.918
That was pretty common.

11:03.404 --> 11:04.245
Well, there were two places.

11:04.265 --> 11:07.289
The Clay Pits was where we'd have a company beer bust.

11:07.309 --> 11:10.172
And you'd have a company beer bust every year.

11:11.834 --> 11:17.281
And that was at the Clay Pits one time, and then pretty close to A&M another time.

11:17.341 --> 11:18.102
I forget the name of that.

11:18.743 --> 11:20.445
That was always fun, the beer bust.

11:20.726 --> 11:22.448
Who paid for that, the beer?

11:23.129 --> 11:24.610
Did everybody chip in?

11:24.650 --> 11:28.315
Well, everybody had a pitch in, something like that.

11:28.295 --> 11:33.221
I know everybody got to go, and I don't remember specifically.

11:33.501 --> 11:34.202
How much beer?

11:34.802 --> 11:35.884
All we could drink, I think.

11:35.904 --> 11:37.285
Is that right?

11:37.305 --> 11:37.966
Yeah, a beer keg.

11:38.827 --> 11:44.293
And if somebody had a little too much, how did he get back to the campus?

11:46.075 --> 11:47.357
Well, they always had too much.

11:47.577 --> 11:50.380
And the younger the kids had too much more than the older guys.

11:50.420 --> 11:54.825
Them getting the older guys drunk was part of it, I think.

11:57.083 --> 12:00.987
I think you had, we didn't have A&M buses or anything.

12:01.007 --> 12:02.969
I think you just had cars or something.

12:02.989 --> 12:07.394
And the clay pits were south of College Station, west of?

12:07.414 --> 12:10.838
I think they were toward Nacogdoches, but I'm not sure.

12:11.959 --> 12:14.942
But they had, so you could go swimming.

12:14.982 --> 12:18.005
You'd swim and then drink beer and lay on the beach.

12:18.065 --> 12:20.888
And of course, all male, naturally.

12:20.908 --> 12:22.190
And was it skinny dipping?

12:22.490 --> 12:24.272
Yeah, I imagine it was.

12:24.691 --> 12:26.354
Maybe we had bathing suits.

12:26.375 --> 12:27.276
We probably had bathing suits.

12:27.296 --> 12:28.639
And it was done at dark.

12:28.659 --> 12:30.082
It was done at like an afternoon.

12:30.263 --> 12:30.904
Oh, afternoon.

12:30.924 --> 12:31.185
Yeah.

12:31.365 --> 12:32.628
Oh, OK.

12:32.708 --> 12:34.171
The beer busts were generally afternoons.

12:34.271 --> 12:34.612
OK.

12:36.335 --> 12:38.059
Now, was Uncle Ed's there then?

12:38.748 --> 12:41.191
I don't think so.

12:41.211 --> 12:48.839
It was his last name check, H-Y-R-D-Y-L-C-K-A, so it became hard liquors.

12:49.059 --> 12:50.440
Hard liquors, no.

12:50.460 --> 12:51.181
Okay.

12:51.201 --> 12:52.623
There weren't really joints there.

12:52.643 --> 12:53.764
You know, we didn't have a lot of money.

12:54.745 --> 12:56.887
Mostly that was in a period of the 50s.

12:57.428 --> 12:59.530
You'd just come out of World War II.

13:00.751 --> 13:04.215
The parents didn't have a lot of money, so the people down there, there wasn't...

13:04.330 --> 13:05.833
You didn't have money to throw around.

13:05.853 --> 13:12.686
So we might go to the bridge and buy a fifth of the cheapest whiskey we could get and split it among eight or ten of us.

13:12.766 --> 13:15.010
But there wasn't money to throw around.

13:16.252 --> 13:18.857
Later generations, their parents did well and they had more money.

13:18.877 --> 13:20.861
But we didn't have money like the kids now.

13:20.901 --> 13:21.883
Nobody did.

13:21.863 --> 13:29.874
You said you bought a car beginning your sophomore year, and you lived in the new dorm area then?

13:30.235 --> 13:32.478
Yeah, sophomore year we went to the new dorm area.

13:32.498 --> 13:32.959
To Duncan.

13:34.080 --> 13:35.582
And were there parking stickers then?

13:36.404 --> 13:38.086
Well, you know, there was plenty of parking places.

13:39.148 --> 13:42.492
I parked, and it was right across from the dorm.

13:42.572 --> 13:45.136
You know, the street on the dorm, I parked right there.

13:45.156 --> 13:46.037
There weren't many cars.

13:46.117 --> 13:49.322
I was one of the few that had a car, and I'd made the money farming cotton.

13:49.606 --> 13:55.134
And I had the money to buy a car, and I didn't intend to do it, but that 36 hours said, I believe it's time to get a car.

13:55.975 --> 13:57.718
Did you worry about it ever being stolen?

13:58.018 --> 13:58.960
No.

13:58.980 --> 14:00.021
No.

14:00.041 --> 14:02.745
Now, my bicycle got stolen, but I always knew where to go get it.

14:03.146 --> 14:05.509
Hart Hall would always have it.

14:05.529 --> 14:08.934
What were the rules about lending a car?

14:09.014 --> 14:11.978
Did anybody bug you about borrowing a car?

14:12.299 --> 14:12.399
No.

14:12.459 --> 14:16.525
You know, we had the campus cops, but they were mostly...

14:17.112 --> 14:21.239
tied to guys drowning out or something like that, mischief.

14:21.259 --> 14:23.322
I don't think they had serious problems then.

14:23.783 --> 14:29.973
The School of 7,000, all male, the day before drugs and those kind of problems came about.

14:30.053 --> 14:33.058
So we were probably, you know, a pretty simple group.

14:33.238 --> 14:35.202
In hindsight, we didn't have a lot of money.

14:35.222 --> 14:35.903
We had to work.

14:36.524 --> 14:41.652
Nearly all of the men that went into the military, we had to, one form or another.

14:42.965 --> 14:47.131
So in hindsight, we'd do a lot of beer drinking, a lot of talking, but that's about all we got done.

14:47.692 --> 14:51.919
How common was it for a student to have either beer or whiskey in his room?

14:52.099 --> 14:52.800
Oh, you didn't have it.

14:52.860 --> 14:53.441
It wasn't allowed.

14:54.162 --> 14:55.083
It was not allowed at all.

14:55.103 --> 14:56.425
Smoking.

14:56.445 --> 14:57.447
Did they smoke in the dorm?

14:57.687 --> 15:00.231
I think so.

15:00.251 --> 15:02.474
What was the favorite brands?

15:02.595 --> 15:04.838
Favorite brands were probably Camels and

15:06.455 --> 15:10.080
I didn't start smoking until I went to A&M, and I wish I hadn't.

15:10.100 --> 15:11.942
I did quit after 10 years.

15:12.042 --> 15:13.204
Lucky's?

15:13.304 --> 15:15.788
Lucky Strikes and Camels would have been the two.

15:15.808 --> 15:17.790
And yes, I think we did smoke in the dorm.

15:17.810 --> 15:20.153
I don't think there was a lot of smoking.

15:20.173 --> 15:20.994
I don't remember a lot.

15:21.015 --> 15:22.216
I think the guys smoked.

15:22.236 --> 15:24.159
Any pipes and cigars?

15:24.179 --> 15:25.881
Yeah, probably some, but not...

15:26.722 --> 15:30.346
Maybe pipes more than no cigars that I remember.

15:30.366 --> 15:31.847
Snuff, chewing tobacco?

15:31.987 --> 15:33.749
I don't think there was much snuff in it.

15:33.769 --> 15:36.752
Did you and your buddies even know the word marijuana?

15:36.993 --> 15:37.954
No, no.

15:38.214 --> 15:39.455
This wasn't there.

15:40.296 --> 15:43.239
It was what the lower, lowest, low class might do.

15:43.760 --> 15:46.482
And there just wasn't any drugs there.

15:46.502 --> 15:53.910
And how fortunate we were that we didn't have to, you know, we weren't diverted like so many young people had gotten caught with that.

15:53.890 --> 15:58.899
Now, the campus administration then, who was the president when you got there?

15:58.919 --> 15:59.099
M.T.

15:59.139 --> 15:59.600
Harrington.

16:00.101 --> 16:02.646
What did you all think of Dr. Harrington?

16:02.666 --> 16:03.387
He's a good man.

16:03.948 --> 16:06.893
But, you know, he's kind of like God way up there, you know?

16:06.913 --> 16:14.667
And then one of the stories we talk about some, the bull,

16:14.933 --> 16:15.834
was Boatner.

16:16.756 --> 16:17.957
Boatner was the commandant.

16:18.017 --> 16:18.979
Hayden Boatner.

16:18.999 --> 16:23.345
And he was then, he left A&M, and he cleaned out that island.

16:23.385 --> 16:28.853
I'm not sure you've been told about that, where the captured Koreans kind of rebelled.

16:28.873 --> 16:35.222
Well, he went over there and straightened that out pretty quick, and we all said, well, hell yeah, because he's used to running a prison camp at A&M.

16:35.242 --> 16:38.226
I know you've heard that before, but that was one of the saying.

16:38.246 --> 16:39.608
But he was tough.

16:39.858 --> 16:41.949
And, you know, there's a great respect for the Bulls.

16:42.009 --> 16:43.739
We were wide-eyed about all that.

16:44.463 --> 16:47.016
Now, who was the band director?

16:48.616 --> 16:54.682
Well, we had a, you know, I was never only in the brief marching under the main director.

16:54.702 --> 16:55.523
And I can't remember.

16:55.603 --> 16:56.905
Colonel Adams.

16:57.606 --> 16:57.786
Oh, yeah.

16:57.806 --> 16:58.747
Colonel Adams, yes.

16:59.107 --> 17:00.348
And he was there a long time.

17:01.450 --> 17:02.311
And he was a good man.

17:02.351 --> 17:03.692
I remember him being a good man.

17:03.732 --> 17:09.278
Tried to look after, I kind of remember him trying to help the freshman a little bit.

17:09.698 --> 17:10.780
Did you know Colonel Andy?

17:11.360 --> 17:11.941
No, I did not.

17:12.722 --> 17:13.242
Yeah.

17:13.262 --> 17:14.944
See, I've learned from his son.

17:17.287 --> 17:20.832
how the 12th man may probably have gotten started.

17:22.454 --> 17:36.932
Colonel Andy grew up in Central Tennessee, went his senior year to a prep school where the football coach was a promising young man who later would be the head coach at the University of Texas.

17:37.853 --> 17:40.797
And right now my brain's not recovering his name.

17:41.017 --> 17:45.403
Well, Dad played under the guy that later went to Texas, but that was way back earlier.

17:45.383 --> 17:46.706
Oh, Dana X Bible.

17:46.726 --> 17:47.287
Yeah.

17:47.368 --> 17:47.688
Okay.

17:47.708 --> 17:48.530
All right.

17:48.550 --> 18:00.237
Then when Young Anderson, the year that Young Anderson finishes prep school, Bible gets hired at Mississippi College, a Methodist, I mean a little Baptist school in Clinton, Mississippi.

18:01.212 --> 18:19.204
The senior year that Anderson is there, they're playing what is now Mississippi State, and for the first time ever, they're ahead of them at the half 13-0, but then in the second half, because they had such a small little traveling squad, a bunch of their guys got hurt,

18:19.842 --> 18:27.451
And while they've got nine men on the field and then a few other plays, 10 men, Mississippi State scores and beats them 14 to 13.

18:27.471 --> 18:28.212
I'll be darn.

18:28.652 --> 18:28.973
All right.

18:28.993 --> 18:47.554
According to young Anderson, who now is a retired ophthalmologist, he said his dad told him when they were at that game in Dallas that Coach Bible came over and said, you remember a few years ago when we were at Mississippi College, what happened?

18:48.648 --> 18:54.259
Now, Heine Weir, our running back, hurt his knee in the Texas game, and he may or may not be able to play the whole game.

18:55.361 --> 18:56.663
I see King Gill up there.

18:57.084 --> 19:00.010
Tell him to come down and put on a uniform in case we need him.

19:00.030 --> 19:00.671
I'll be there.

19:01.392 --> 19:09.087
Well, my first... The summer before I got to A&M in 59, I taught at Schreiner College in Gerville, and...

19:09.320 --> 19:12.090
Heine Weir was the dean then.

19:12.110 --> 19:13.214
Well, I'll be there.

19:13.314 --> 19:14.298
And that was the Weir?

19:14.338 --> 19:15.382
Yeah, I'll be there.

19:15.542 --> 19:20.139
And I wish I had known it to say, Mr. Weir, tell me what really happened.

19:20.159 --> 19:21.102
Yeah, tell me your side.

19:21.723 --> 19:25.388
Well, we kind of make the stories as time goes fine.

19:25.409 --> 19:26.911
Sure, sure.

19:27.512 --> 19:28.173
Now, let's see.

19:28.273 --> 19:30.476
You said you didn't have many dates that first year.

19:30.696 --> 19:31.898
No, I don't think I had any.

19:31.918 --> 19:33.521
All right, what about second and third year?

19:33.661 --> 19:40.932
I went steady with a girl from Fort Stockton, but she didn't come down until like junior year or something like that.

19:41.613 --> 19:44.457
Seemed like between being campused and

19:44.437 --> 19:47.640
that we didn't, I didn't have dates down there much.

19:48.761 --> 19:54.627
And more than that, generally I would go to the date on the weekend rather than them coming down, so.

19:54.647 --> 19:55.568
And out of town?

19:55.929 --> 19:57.030
Yeah, generally out of town.

19:57.050 --> 19:58.151
I didn't know any Brown girls.

20:00.253 --> 20:02.476
The football team had all the Brown girls, you know.

20:02.896 --> 20:06.760
Who were the student celebrities while you were a student?

20:07.681 --> 20:13.667
Monty Montgomery was the head Yale leader who's a businessman in Austin.

20:15.267 --> 20:17.289
Boy, you'd think I'd never forget those.

20:20.173 --> 20:22.416
Corps commanders, athletes?

20:22.576 --> 20:28.603
Yeah, the Corps commander was in my campaign, Colonel of the Corps.

20:34.570 --> 20:36.553
What about the athletes?

20:36.893 --> 20:44.042
Athletes were my freshman year with Bob Smith, All-America, and I guess he was sophomore year.

20:44.697 --> 20:53.631
Billy Tidwell, Barton, who I mentioned, or Barton, Griner, Moberg were the line.

20:55.955 --> 20:56.596
Max Griner.

20:56.756 --> 20:58.278
Max Griner, yeah.

20:58.298 --> 21:01.143
Now, did the athletes go to class?

21:01.964 --> 21:05.489
Yeah, I think so, but probably not as much as we had to.

21:06.431 --> 21:09.516
Did you all think that they didn't have to measure up academically?

21:09.536 --> 21:10.317
I think they didn't.

21:12.355 --> 21:13.236
I saw them in class.

21:13.296 --> 21:13.797
Maybe they did.

21:13.817 --> 21:15.079
I really couldn't say that.

21:15.700 --> 21:16.521
I really couldn't say that.

21:17.002 --> 21:19.806
I think they probably had tutors and softer courses and stuff.

21:20.186 --> 21:24.693
And some of them were academically inclined, so they went to class.

21:24.733 --> 21:25.614
They wanted to learn.

21:26.335 --> 21:27.577
I guess you had different categories.

21:29.479 --> 21:30.941
Quarterback, Tidwell.

21:31.202 --> 21:33.265
Quarterback was Gartemal.

21:33.285 --> 21:34.887
Dick Gartemal.

21:38.849 --> 21:42.654
What was there at Northgate?

21:43.715 --> 21:44.656
Well, loopholes.

21:45.697 --> 21:48.000
And there wasn't any Dixie Chicken or any of that business.

21:48.060 --> 21:48.861
There wasn't much there.

21:48.901 --> 21:51.584
The post office was actually on campus.

21:52.385 --> 21:55.529
Filling station, couple filling stations, bookstores.

21:57.572 --> 21:59.594
I don't think there was any beer halls at Northgate.

21:59.614 --> 22:00.014
There wasn't.

22:00.575 --> 22:01.556
There wasn't any beer then.

22:01.957 --> 22:06.502
If you wanted alcohol, you had to go out to the, if you wanted whiskey, you went to Whiskey Bridge.

22:06.562 --> 22:08.805
And then beer was

22:10.743 --> 22:22.617
We drank beer at the Triangle, which was kind of a drive-in beer hall, which was right next down to the chicken oil, kind of one of my hangouts there.

22:24.960 --> 22:27.543
We just didn't have a lot of partying.

22:27.564 --> 22:30.527
Make believe I had never seen or heard of this guy Lupo.

22:30.747 --> 22:31.468
Tell me about him.

22:31.528 --> 22:33.331
Well, what a great guy he was.

22:33.351 --> 22:34.352
He was an institution.

22:35.153 --> 22:38.657
He was, I guess, when Pinky died,

22:38.637 --> 22:52.609
loophole but kind of came the next guy that's kind of you know the booster and I went by when I was running for governor to see him on his 80th birthday and he really hadn't changed a lot in the years since I was there as a student.

22:52.829 --> 22:55.836
Did you or any of your acquaintances ever borrow money from him?

22:56.322 --> 22:59.707
I didn't, but a lot did and a lot of furnished books.

22:59.828 --> 23:02.271
I mean, he was a great Aggie supporter.

23:02.291 --> 23:03.233
And it wasn't BS.

23:03.293 --> 23:05.316
He was a great, great Aggie booster.

23:06.057 --> 23:08.121
Probably, you know, absolute top.

23:08.802 --> 23:11.005
And he was not an Aggie graduate, I don't think.

23:11.306 --> 23:11.726
Oh, yes.

23:11.746 --> 23:12.067
Was he?

23:12.087 --> 23:17.976
If I'm not mistaken, he and Mr. Rutter and Tiger Teague were classmates.

23:17.956 --> 23:20.458
Wait, you said graduate.

23:20.478 --> 23:22.040
I don't think he finished his degree.

23:22.400 --> 23:23.661
I just didn't think he did.

23:23.721 --> 23:24.602
I think he attended.

23:24.902 --> 23:27.264
He may have attended in maybe just a little while.

23:27.284 --> 23:27.704
I think that.

23:28.065 --> 23:31.648
Maybe he was just there a little while, but he was an Aggie all the way.

23:32.869 --> 23:34.610
This man, you mentioned Pinky Downs.

23:34.630 --> 23:34.951
Yeah.

23:35.091 --> 23:36.012
What did he do?

23:36.032 --> 23:37.673
I remember Pinky.

23:37.693 --> 23:38.694
See, he was there.

23:39.975 --> 23:41.937
He'd get on the stage.

23:41.957 --> 23:42.817
Little skinny guy.

23:43.458 --> 23:47.001
He'd roll up his sleeve, and he'd get all ready, and he'd lead to Yale's.

23:47.875 --> 23:49.316
And he was kind of an institution.

23:49.356 --> 23:54.741
They always talk about Pinky as the guy that said, with this funeral, this sorry old guy, and nobody wants to say anything.

23:54.781 --> 23:57.384
Well, nobody wants to say a word about the deceased.

23:57.424 --> 23:59.185
I want to say a few words about Texas A&M.

23:59.205 --> 24:00.807
And that was one of her stories.

24:00.907 --> 24:05.912
He was kind of our idol, role model, or institution.

24:06.652 --> 24:14.880
I don't know if I've described the word yet for Lupo and Pinky, but they were our symbol or our booster.

24:14.900 --> 24:15.660
What's the word?

24:15.680 --> 24:17.342
There's a better word for it.

24:18.115 --> 24:20.759
They were, you know, they weren't role models.

24:20.779 --> 24:37.862
They were, because I remember Pinky hearing him say that he was, his job was to welcome people,

24:38.467 --> 24:44.052
and to kind of make them feel proud of the campus, that sort of thing.

24:44.072 --> 24:44.853
Yeah, well, he did.

24:44.913 --> 24:45.314
He did.

24:45.834 --> 24:47.536
But he was tied to the students.

24:48.417 --> 24:49.157
We adored him.

24:49.177 --> 24:49.878
We loved him.

24:51.079 --> 24:53.622
Mascot might be a shallow word.

24:54.863 --> 24:59.707
And Lupo was, of course, probably a little more depth than Pinky, actually.

24:59.727 --> 25:02.130
How often did you and your friends go to Bryan?

25:03.331 --> 25:04.592
Not too often.

25:04.690 --> 25:10.357
Maybe during the spring, you know, football season was pretty well tied until football season was over.

25:11.018 --> 25:12.520
There wasn't much going on day and end.

25:13.421 --> 25:15.924
Maybe after the game, you'd go to a beer hall somewhere.

25:15.984 --> 25:23.052
But by and large, then the spring is when you had more free time, particularly in the band, of course.

25:24.014 --> 25:25.235
And you'd go to Brian's son.

25:25.255 --> 25:29.440
But generally when you'd go, because there weren't any girls, you went further.

25:30.321 --> 25:33.465
You know, there wasn't any date unless you went out with a bunch of boys to

25:33.833 --> 25:39.124
raise cane, you went to another town because that's where the girls are instead of where the boys are.

25:40.167 --> 25:50.509
As this Korean War got worse, did you and your buddies in serious moments talk about the war and what it might mean to you?

25:51.147 --> 25:52.790
Here we are in a military setting.

25:53.090 --> 25:57.518
The big group that made it would get commissions, or most did.

25:58.300 --> 26:02.627
And so your decision was, do I stay or do I volunteer and go now?

26:03.269 --> 26:06.895
And the bulk, I think, probably nearly all of us stayed.

26:07.077 --> 26:11.183
They said, well, if it's going to be a long, we understood the Cold War by that time.

26:11.263 --> 26:12.866
We understood what was happening with Russia.

26:13.687 --> 26:15.990
And so, you know, we were going to go into service.

26:16.411 --> 26:17.552
It was going to be a long deal.

26:17.593 --> 26:26.065
So we said, basically, you were at A&M hoping you'd get a commission as you went to serve your country rather than to be drafted or something like that.

26:26.085 --> 26:29.891
And you were hoping to get a commission in what branch?

26:29.991 --> 26:30.712
In the Air Force.

26:30.732 --> 26:31.473
I was going to fly.

26:31.513 --> 26:33.456
And I did not get a commission.

26:34.280 --> 26:44.239
And that's a little bit of a long story, but basically I laid out one semester, my first semester of my junior year, to help my dad put the farm in level irrigation.

26:44.299 --> 26:51.833
I came back a little out of sync, and at the end of my junior year, they changed the rules and said, if you don't fly,

26:52.505 --> 26:55.689
You can't get a commission in administration.

26:55.709 --> 26:56.890
I'd studied administration.

26:57.031 --> 27:00.956
I didn't like the military enough to want to make a career of it.

27:01.196 --> 27:04.760
Flying was four years, administration was two years.

27:04.780 --> 27:07.544
So I come back and say, well, I don't want to do that.

27:08.665 --> 27:17.256
And so they said, OK, then you can go back and get a commission in the Army, but you have to start over, which would have been one extra year.

27:17.336 --> 27:19.018
So I said, well, I'm not going to do that.

27:19.673 --> 27:20.855
And so I dropped out.

27:21.136 --> 27:24.403
As soon as I dropped out, then they changed it again.

27:24.423 --> 27:28.331
By then it was too late, so I just volunteered for the draft when I got out of A&M.

27:28.632 --> 27:29.494
Got that behind.

27:29.975 --> 27:34.605
Everybody had to serve, so I just served and enlisted me in.

27:34.685 --> 27:36.970
And I really always regretted not getting a commission.

27:37.010 --> 27:38.833
But fate does you some things.

27:38.914 --> 27:40.517
It probably worked out.

27:40.497 --> 27:41.840
for the best for me.

27:41.860 --> 27:47.771
Now, I can't remember any events because I'm in college two years before you.

27:48.933 --> 27:55.806
Can you remember any event, national or international, that happened and you remember where you were when you heard the news?

27:56.377 --> 27:58.001
Well, yeah, MacArthur resigning.

27:58.162 --> 27:58.563
Oh, yes.

27:58.804 --> 28:04.479
I was in, I think it was freshman, in the freshman dorm.

28:04.519 --> 28:06.665
That was probably pretty close to spring then.

28:07.467 --> 28:11.398
And that's when I became a Republican, when Truman fired MacArthur, you know?

28:11.378 --> 28:14.062
And we were all indoctrinated for better or for worse.

28:14.262 --> 28:15.544
Yeah.

28:15.684 --> 28:21.593
Outside of that, I just remember when the, you know, you knew it was pretty serious when the Chinese came in.

28:21.653 --> 28:25.179
We're talking about a war with Russia and China and Korea.

28:25.659 --> 28:27.262
And this is getting pretty serious stuff then.

28:27.722 --> 28:29.585
And that was kind of in the Christmas holidays.

28:29.665 --> 28:32.049
So the holidays were a little confusing.

28:32.069 --> 28:34.112
But do we, you know, what's going to happen?

28:34.132 --> 28:35.714
Do we need to go to war?

28:36.055 --> 28:37.918
Are they going to say you need to go to war?

28:37.958 --> 28:40.862
Do we need to stay and get a study?

28:40.842 --> 29:06.698
so it until it became known what we should do there was uncertainty and a lot of guys just quit and went on in and but the bulk of said no i think our future is best served to stay in school and that's what i did uh summer jobs for you were back home always summer job always work and in the spring and time off my dad bought some land but he wasn't a rancher because he knew there was some water

29:06.897 --> 29:11.784
He'd watch some oil wells be drilled and there was some water west of Fort Stockton.

29:11.804 --> 29:14.447
So he bought the land more as a speculator.

29:15.428 --> 29:18.973
Well, I loved ranching and I loved farming, still do this day.

29:19.874 --> 29:23.059
So he just turned it over to me at a very young age.

29:23.800 --> 29:26.904
Like I'm a freshman in high school and I'm managing an irrigated farm.

29:27.805 --> 29:29.968
So I had so much experience.

29:30.843 --> 29:32.305
that most kids didn't have.

29:32.325 --> 29:35.590
Most kids went to school when they were 18 because that's what you do when you're 18.

29:36.131 --> 29:39.216
And I went to school and said, I need to know how to do a better job.

29:39.556 --> 29:43.843
And I learned more than nearly all my peers because I was thirsty.

29:43.883 --> 29:45.145
I needed to learn that.

29:45.205 --> 29:48.991
So I was a manager in the team.

29:49.031 --> 29:51.214
You know, from 14 years old, I was managing

29:51.498 --> 29:53.964
Had men working for me and things like that.

29:53.984 --> 29:56.691
So yes, always.

29:57.313 --> 30:05.193
And did you have an account in the family business that was your money that you spent at A&M?

30:05.254 --> 30:06.216
Yes, yes.

30:06.787 --> 30:09.831
For example, I didn't work for my dad one year.

30:09.871 --> 30:10.693
I made the cotton money.

30:10.713 --> 30:14.017
I made $1,500 one summer farming cotton.

30:14.598 --> 30:17.062
I mean, you know, you'd make $100 labor.

30:17.082 --> 30:20.787
So I had made money, and I'd run some goats on another festival.

30:20.827 --> 30:23.571
I was entrepreneurial very young, and I had some money.

30:24.813 --> 30:26.536
But I was tight, and I'm still tight.

30:30.041 --> 30:31.663
Were there any...

30:32.032 --> 30:35.517
off-campus celebrities that came to visit A&M while you were there?

30:35.537 --> 30:43.189
Lyndon Johnson came like our junior year to make a talk, but as far as movie stars, anybody, I don't remember.

30:43.749 --> 30:46.894
Did you and your buddies get to see Johnson up close?

30:46.914 --> 30:49.658
No, we were distant, you know, where he made the speech or something like that.

30:50.119 --> 30:51.942
So you didn't, he didn't make much of it?

30:51.962 --> 30:56.649
You know, A&M at that point, 7,000 students, we just weren't all that big an outfit.

30:56.669 --> 30:59.693
I mean, to us we were, and we, our great,

30:59.740 --> 31:13.581
badge of honor in a way was that they never quit or what was the movie you know with the we've never been like we've never been licked yeah and so that was our claim to fame that they made it on the campus and things like that but it wasn't that
