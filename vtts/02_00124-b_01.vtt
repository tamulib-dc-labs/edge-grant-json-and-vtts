WEBVTT

00:03.406 --> 00:20.062
So the, what was the, after being in the Corps, was 
there the next internal, was it the band or the RVs

00:03.406 --> 00:20.062
or fish drill team that came up next? It all came to a 
head with Melanie Sincrap in that trial because

00:20.162 --> 00:31.573
everything then was lumped in together as it 
related to women And that's in the late 70s,

00:31.925 --> 00:39.293
because she graduates in May of 80. Well, yeah, so 
it was probably mid-70s.

00:48.744 --> 00:51.807
Why her?

00:54.310 --> 00:55.751
How did she become the focus?

00:59.356 --> 01:00.717
I really don't know. And when I say I really don't 
know, I think

01:01.253 --> 01:23.383
it takes an individual that's

01:01.253 --> 01:23.383
really bitter about

01:01.253 --> 01:23.383
the manner in which they've been treated, I think, 
to go around cheating. And I think she became very

01:23.403 --> 01:30.973
bitter about the manner in which the males treated 
her before. And so her bitterness initially was

01:32.000 --> 01:37.945
her individual treatment. She was in the Corps for 
years. Now I understand, that's my way of saying I

01:40.267 --> 02:01.146
don't know for sure, I understand that her father 
and stepfather were both bird colonels, I think

01:40.267 --> 02:01.146
Air Force, and that her mother had a physical 
handicap, I think wheelchair bound, and I had

01:40.267 --> 02:01.146
heard that The mother raised the daughter not to 
take no for an answer. Don't let somebody put

02:05.879 --> 02:07.801
something over on you. You keep plugging away. Did 
you have any

02:09.843 --> 02:17.932
interaction with Melanie? No. In fact, she never 
did come to see me. So you can't describe her by? No.

02:23.718 --> 02:24.819
Never did come in. And that was one of the points 
that I made back at the trial, initially. If

02:31.012 --> 02:38.059
someone was that embittered or had that much of a 
problem, why did they come to see me? Of course,

02:38.099 --> 02:42.905
going back to what I said earlier about the Corps, 
about keeping everything within.

02:45.667 --> 02:56.058
I think, I don't think that group of people at that 
time felt comfortable in going outside. Anyone,

02:56.259 --> 02:58.521
male, female, whatever. That changed over a 
period of time. People would come visit with me

03:02.602 --> 03:09.029
about anything and everything, but not that group 
in the Corps back at that time. Did the trial

03:09.049 --> 03:13.453
involving Melanie, did that occur while she was 
still a student? Yes, it did. And what was the

03:14.935 --> 03:15.976
decision? The decision back at that time

03:17.117 --> 03:27.968
was

03:17.117 --> 03:27.968
against

03:30.850 --> 03:50.528
The

03:30.850 --> 03:50.528
decision was made in favor of Melvin. And if I'm not 
mistaken, that women could be members of all the

03:50.548 --> 04:00.317
organizations to include the band.

04:02.761 --> 04:09.687
There was a financial settlement in regard to 
court costs and all. I remember that it cost us a lot

04:10.568 --> 04:13.091
of money. I remember that. And my thought was that 
that was something we really didn't need to spend

04:14.892 --> 04:23.060
all that money on. A federal court? Uh-huh. All 
right, let's go to the stage at Melanie's

04:26.723 --> 04:30.507
graduation. Did you anticipate any incident? Had 
you heard any? None. Had not heard anything at all.

04:39.482 --> 04:41.846
And I was looking the other way. I was not too far 
from you. And I was not looking and I heard the

04:44.270 --> 04:52.062
almost like a stunned audience. And had to ask 
someone who was sitting next to me what had

04:52.503 --> 04:56.068
happened. And that's when I found out the jurors 
had not changed. Right. I was up on the front of the,

04:59.507 --> 05:13.579
let's put this in the tape, I was up on the front row 
in my dean of faculties duties normally after

04:59.507 --> 05:13.579
bringing the mace and putting it on the front, I 
would go to the back row and sit down. After his

05:14.320 --> 05:28.573
speech that day, Lieutenant Governor Bill Hobby 
had motioned for me, as the diploma was being

05:14.320 --> 05:28.573
passed, I'd come up and he said, now when you get out 
to UT El Paso as the new president, stay in contact,

05:14.320 --> 05:28.573
maybe I can help. And so we're just shooting the 
breeze, and I'm about to go back to my seat to get

05:29.633 --> 05:41.771
ready for the end of it, because I look and see there 
are only a few names left, and I hear a little bit of

05:29.633 --> 05:41.771
hissing. And I said, oh my, good gracious. And he 
said, what do you mean? I said, well, there's some

05:45.656 --> 05:46.958
hissing. That means somebody doesn't like 
something. And I look to my right and see about one

05:49.762 --> 05:59.016
or two people away from coming up to get the diploma 
was Melanie Zingray. He remembered her as having

05:59.975 --> 06:03.659
been, quote, a pain in the neck. And he may have used 
some stronger words than that, because he said she

06:04.901 --> 06:09.727
had pestered him over and over. And so we are right 
there when, as I recall, Dr. Miller says, no way I'm

06:10.568 --> 06:17.276
going to shake your hand. And the whole audience 
then was kind of stunned. All right, do you

06:22.682 --> 06:29.931
remember anything being said or done as we go back 
into the letterman's lounge? I remember a couple

06:30.890 --> 06:36.358
of board members coming up to Jarvis saying, damn 
right, Jarvis, I wouldn't shake in her hand

06:30.890 --> 06:36.358
either. She doesn't deserve to have her. I 
normally, as I came back in, scooted out that back

06:42.466 --> 06:48.174
sliding door to scoot over. And so I probably was 
right there when that was.

06:56.025 --> 07:00.171
I normally walked out with a board member. Because

07:01.028 --> 07:15.730
I sat in the front row always in what, third down or 
whatever, so there would have been a board member

07:01.028 --> 07:15.730
coming up the other side. And I don't remember 
anybody saying anything to me going down the aisle

07:16.874 --> 07:21.499
and all the way back. And then I just slipped out. 
Did you hear anything in the next few days? Did you

07:27.044 --> 07:28.766
hear any comments or anything? Yeah, I heard the 
kind of comments you were talking about. The

07:33.330 --> 07:36.994
number of people were saying, well, it's good that 
he didn't shake her hand. She deserved it, et

07:37.074 --> 07:38.396
cetera. Did you hear anybody giving Jarvis a hard 
time for not? I didn't either. All right, let's

07:44.802 --> 07:46.303
jump back in time now. Let's go back. And let's go to 
the, let's go back to the Williams years. Mrs.

07:54.802 --> 08:00.450
Williams, describe her as the president's wife.

08:02.673 --> 08:15.872
Margaret,

08:02.673 --> 08:15.872
she very strong as a person and had very strong 
feelings about everything. And I'm not trying to

08:16.426 --> 08:20.932
hide it. I don't remember the conversations that 
we had about specific things. All I remember,

08:25.518 --> 08:30.425
though, no matter what it was, she would tell you 
how she felt about it. And I know she was not too

08:30.445 --> 08:37.495
thrilled about board members who gave Dr. 
Williams a tough time. She was very protective of

08:37.615 --> 08:41.320
Dr. Williams. It was so before he had his heart 
attack and very much so afterwards. So she was very

08:46.135 --> 08:48.979
protective.

08:50.501 --> 09:03.580
Her life, her thoughts were about her kids, her 
family, hoping things would go well for them.

09:04.100 --> 09:08.927
She was always cordial to me, always very nice, 
very pleasant. I remember one time she came over

09:09.532 --> 09:15.077
and borrowed some peanut butter next door. We 
enjoyed living next to them. They were very

09:19.982 --> 09:24.006
private people. Alright, let's go to his health. 
Were you aware before his heart attack that that

09:26.008 --> 09:30.913
might be approaching? Wasn't aware specifically 
in regard to to Dr. Williams, although he had told

09:36.768 --> 09:40.533
me about his family before. So I knew that there was 
a history of heart problems in his family. But you

09:44.958 --> 09:52.407
never think about it as it relates to that specific 
individual and something was going to happen. So I

09:52.427 --> 09:56.452
never really gave it much thought, other than the 
fact that I was aware. Do you remember anything

09:57.353 --> 10:00.497
about the evening it occurred, or how you first 
heard? I was out at a golf course. I was playing

10:05.025 --> 10:10.612
golf, and the word came out that he had been rushed 
to St. Joseph's. Of course, I was playing at Briar

10:10.632 --> 10:14.016
Place, which was right here close by. And I left the 
golf course and went up there. Everything is fuzzy

10:19.463 --> 10:20.965
in my mind. After that, I remember Nelda, and I 
remember Margaret, and the fact that he had had a

10:21.065 --> 10:28.695
massive heart attack. And it happened in the 
afternoon? Uh-huh. It was Haskell, I think it was

10:31.917 --> 10:42.110
mid-afternoon, mid to late afternoon. In the 
office? I'm not sure where it was. I don't remember

10:44.993 --> 10:46.195
that either. I'm not sure where it was. All I 
remember is I was on the golf course. And you know,

10:49.559 --> 10:52.643
for some reason, that makes me think it's 
Saturday. OK. And then he's taken to Houston. and

11:00.907 --> 11:09.659
what little I remember is that we heard 
immediately that it was very, very serious. Yeah,

11:09.899 --> 11:11.402
that's what I heard. That's what they said to me. 
And they didn't think he was going to make it.

11:20.614 --> 11:21.415
Right. I remember that. I was in shock. I just 
hadn't even thought about it. And if I'm not

11:27.383 --> 11:31.850
mistaken, it was a number of weeks before he's 
back. Describe him physically when you saw him

11:33.973 --> 11:37.739
after he came back. He was really pale. I remember 
that. Looked like he had lost a lot of weight in the

11:44.369 --> 11:51.600
short period of time.

11:51.620 --> 11:56.007
So much more subdued personality-wise.

11:57.488 --> 12:13.156
Do

11:57.488 --> 12:13.156
you remember anything in his lifestyle

11:57.488 --> 12:13.156
before the heart attack that in hindsight might 
have contributed to it? I don't remember smoking.

12:15.595 --> 12:17.638
I don't remember his overdoing anything. No.

12:20.943 --> 12:22.224
Not a thing that would indicate it. The only thing 
is his temper, his emotional competitiveness.

12:33.160 --> 12:33.581
Let's see. If you remember any, share some 
Williams anecdotes.

12:40.190 --> 12:42.413
The funniest one to me was I went to his office with a 
budget meeting. One time in that long rectangular

12:48.756 --> 12:59.125
table that he had in his office, and Nella sat on one 
side, Dr. Williams was on the end, and I was on this

12:48.756 --> 12:59.125
side. And we were talking about money. And we were 
talking about a particular couple of figures. And

13:08.634 --> 13:12.197
he multiplied something together. And I laughed. 
It wasn't even close. Like he missed it by $180,000

13:15.327 --> 13:18.872
or something. And I said to him, you know, you only 
missed about $180,000. That's not bad for a

13:22.257 --> 13:24.721
history major. And he turned and he kicked me in the 
shin. And

13:26.724 --> 13:32.151
I laughed. But anyway, he, oh, you would always 
refer to your wife as being, you married... She

13:39.937 --> 13:41.359
married the lower self. I remember using that

13:41.479 --> 13:49.410
word. In regard to administrative style, I would 
keep things in a folder and then I would schedule a

13:49.430 --> 14:01.486
time to go visit with them. And then I would decide, 
after I walked into the office and sat down,

14:01.506 --> 14:08.796
whether it was going to be a social visit we would 
handle a couple of minor things or we would get into

14:09.485 --> 14:16.092
major issues. When he was in a bad mood, and a bad 
mood being something was bothering him for one

14:16.112 --> 14:32.430
reason or another, that he would just 
automatically be strongly in opposition to

14:16.112 --> 14:32.430
whatever it was that you were talking about. So I 
learned administratively to decide what kind of

14:33.150 --> 14:39.357
mood he was in before we ever got into issues. As I 
said earlier, he was always very down to earth, no

14:42.733 --> 14:51.926
put on.

14:55.291 --> 15:01.260
When he wasn't emotionally upset about 
something, would interact very well with you

14:55.291 --> 15:01.260
about whatever. And he was so bright. Go ahead. I 
was going to say, I always thought he had an almost

15:07.501 --> 15:20.357
endless file of good items to throw in a speech and 
so forth that those he had filed away. Do you

15:20.377 --> 15:29.988
remember any major proposal that you tried to 
market to him that he didn't buy into? I don't want

15:30.008 --> 15:32.091
to. One of the, one of the, I'll always remember 
this one. I went to see him about counseling

15:40.395 --> 15:47.181
center, personal counseling center. And he let me 
know very quickly that any student, and those

15:47.201 --> 15:56.110
kinds of problems didn't need to be a student at 
Texas A&M. And so I, over a period of time, We

16:02.058 --> 16:07.947
discussed it and we eventually created the 
personal counseling center. And that was

16:07.967 --> 16:14.857
something he was totally opposed to initially.

16:14.877 --> 16:23.230
But again, his rationale was if they have that kind 
of a problem, that A&M wasn't the place that they

16:14.877 --> 16:23.230
ought to be. And my argument was we have a lot of good 
kids. carry a lot of baggage with them because of

16:27.944 --> 16:35.292
the families, the attention they had or not had as 
youngsters. And when I came, that was one of the

16:35.312 --> 16:41.699
things I thought we needed very badly, right at the 
very beginning. And I had told Wade Birch, Wade who

16:41.999 --> 16:54.373
had done a super job for me at East Texas, and I had 
hired Wade, that if I could create one here, that I

16:54.539 --> 17:00.606
would want him to come down and get that one 
started. And so that all came about. And that was in

17:02.608 --> 17:03.770
74 as well. All right. Do you remember any major 
ideas in student affairs that he introduced that

17:04.971 --> 17:14.782
you all used? Well, it was one that we all used, I 
think, Because we were all comfortable with it,

17:20.071 --> 17:33.528
but the fact that he brought those kids up there 
into his office, Ken Caperton and Roger, we

17:20.071 --> 17:33.528
thought that kids ought to be involved all over, 
all the time. So it was something we all agreed to.

17:39.456 --> 17:43.822
He had done it before I got here, so I felt more 
comfortable probably in doing so. But we involved

17:44.363 --> 17:49.369
kids in everything.

17:50.227 --> 18:02.672
And then

17:50.227 --> 18:02.672
I had the weekly meetings with the students and 
student leadership and we chatted. He wanted to

18:03.233 --> 18:07.662
have some kind of relationship with them and we 
worked it out. to where they had dinner, not

18:08.063 --> 18:14.311
dinner, but lunch once a month. Remember that? And 
it was my two groups that I had. I had a Thursday

18:17.436 --> 18:22.222
night dinner with the executive committee of 
student building. And then I had about 10 other

18:22.242 --> 18:27.409
major student leaders on the alderman for 
Thursday. And so once a month for lunch, we'd bring

18:27.830 --> 18:34.258
those about 20 kids and we'd have lunch with about 
20. And then I would sit at the end of the table and

18:37.561 --> 18:39.743
only be a resource. It was his. He sat in the middle, 
sort of like the Last Supper. It's middle, and then

18:43.707 --> 18:46.770
the 20 would be around, and I'd be at the end. So that 
was a way for him to have that interaction.

18:55.919 --> 19:04.547
Describe his relation, Dr. Williams' relation 
with students and their reaction to him. That

19:05.067 --> 19:08.491
first year, Randy Ross was student body 
president. Randy just loved Dr. Williams. And

19:11.113 --> 19:16.800
Randy's girlfriend at the time, Sandy, who was 
very actively involved, loved him too. And they

19:16.860 --> 19:22.506
got married that summer after that first year that 
I was here. And we flew with the Williams to San

19:22.526 --> 19:29.173
Antonio for the wedding. But the...

19:34.700 --> 19:35.942
He was very relaxed. Some presidents, for some 
reason, get uptight around students, but he was

19:36.883 --> 19:44.893
very relaxed around students, and they 
appreciated that. He was very honest with them,

19:45.434 --> 20:02.175
very frank, very friendly,

19:45.434 --> 20:02.175
and not paternalistic in any way, just a friendly, 
nice human being to the students, and they enjoyed

19:45.434 --> 20:02.175
that interaction, that relationship. All right, 
how was he in dealing with paperwork? Did the

20:08.056 --> 20:13.261
paper, was there a paper flow in and out or did 
things get lost? Paper flow went fast and the, I'm

20:13.401 --> 20:23.471
sure Nelda was helpful with that. I can remember I 
sent over talking about funny things.

20:31.484 --> 20:48.946
all worked all of the fall, putting together all my 
ideas in regard to how I wanted to change things

20:31.484 --> 20:48.946
administratively, and so I had my secretary put 
all that together for me during the Christmas

20:31.484 --> 20:48.946
holidays, and I sent it to him right after we came 
back to school, starting in January. Just before I

20:49.987 --> 21:01.221
sent it to him, I saw a cartoon in the newspaper, and 
the cartoon was one glob speaking to the other, and

20:49.987 --> 21:01.221
one glob was saying, I'm beginning to believe that 
the meek will never inherit the earth. I made a copy

21:04.265 --> 21:10.706
of that cartoon and I attached it to my proposal 
that I sent to him. Sent that proposal over. And I

21:13.148 --> 21:15.130
got a call from Nellie. And Nellie said she heard 
Dr. Williams just laughing and beat a storm. And

21:21.177 --> 21:22.298
she wondered what it was. So she went in to see. And 
he was looking at my cartoon. So again, that was

21:27.423 --> 21:29.345
fun. You could use humor as a part of even the 
administrative style. But yeah, you never had to

21:34.491 --> 21:39.376
worry about waiting on things from Dr. Williams. 
It was one way or the other. quick response. Did he

21:43.641 --> 21:44.943
have any pet peeves?

21:53.935 --> 21:57.299
I think if anything it was people not being honest 
and direct with him. That he wanted people to be

22:00.082 --> 22:05.970
honest and frank with

22:00.082 --> 22:05.970
him. He couldn't stand pussyfooting around. I

22:11.469 --> 22:16.797
think it was like paperwork and everything else. 
You made a decision and you went on with things, and

22:17.678 --> 22:23.026
you just did the piddle and piddle and piddle. Some 
of those things were driving crazy as it related to

22:23.046 --> 22:32.220
trying to catch the board in the right mood, in a 
good mood, to kind of push something through the

22:23.046 --> 22:32.220
board. So that would bother him. The

22:37.405 --> 22:49.442
kind of administrator you'd like to work for and 
with?

22:50.824 --> 22:51.284
Let's see. In those early years, do you remember 
any goals you had that, as you recall now, you

22:51.685 --> 23:06.906
weren't able to bring to reality? No.

23:11.762 --> 23:25.266
That first year and that proposal I sent forward, 
one of the things that I worked on at East Texas and

23:11.762 --> 23:25.266
thought it was important for us to do at that time 
was to have legal services available for

23:11.762 --> 23:25.266
students. Gwen Flint, who was very actively 
involved with that, with me, and we got that

23:25.887 --> 23:32.756
approved. Everything that we wanted to do and 
thought was important, he was helpful and

23:32.776 --> 23:39.045
supportive. Now, you didn't get 35 staff members 
for every department, We made some movement in

23:45.327 --> 23:50.854
every area, and he was very supportive in that 
regard. And again, the support was providing

23:51.394 --> 24:02.748
services and programs for students, and that's 
what he wanted done, and that's what he wanted me to

23:51.394 --> 24:02.748
do, and he was very supportive of that. Did you feel 
that the area under your administrative

24:02.768 --> 24:07.774
responsibility was getting fair treatment 
compared to the rest of the campus? Yes, without a

24:12.585 --> 24:14.669
doubt. Tom Cherry was supportive and helpful. 
John and you all in John's office. John was very

24:19.818 --> 24:28.174
supportive and has always been supportive of me in 
regard to the things I was attempting to do. So I

24:28.194 --> 24:31.500
never felt hindered in any way. by the 
administrative staff or by the pros. It was very

24:36.422 --> 24:37.182
important. Let's go back then chronologically. 
Dr. Williams has the heart attack, and then

24:38.704 --> 24:49.136
administratively, who took over his 
responsibilities, as you recall? For me, the

24:50.457 --> 24:56.184
person who then contacted me about everything was 
Clyde Freeman. Clyde was the one. My assumption,

24:57.605 --> 25:00.188
though, was that... Mr. Wells was the one that was 
really in charge, and that Clyde was doing his

25:00.556 --> 25:08.609
business for Clyde Wells. Alright, did Mr. Wells 
physically come to the campus and take up office? I

25:16.301 --> 25:24.795
didn't see him that way, but I heard that he did, and 
I heard he was here for lengthy periods of time in

25:16.301 --> 25:24.795
that office. Alright, and then Dr. Williams comes 
back, And then there is that board meeting where

25:29.092 --> 25:40.302
the board selects Dr. Miller as the new president. 
Do you remember your first conversations with

25:41.063 --> 25:48.789
him, with Dr. Miller? Early on, I remember I had 
never met him before. And so it was the first

25:54.474 --> 25:57.377
meeting, and it was cordial. It was interesting 
for me because at that time the University of

25:58.066 --> 26:12.604
Arkansas was courting me as a possibility for the 
Chief Student Affairs Officer at the University

25:58.066 --> 26:12.604
of Arkansas. So as John did with Jarvis, I went to 
see Jarvis, set up an appointment, and

26:12.624 --> 26:26.301
told him that I wanted him to

26:26.973 --> 26:30.402
to have whomever he wanted in that particular 
position And if he did not, if he was not interested

26:31.276 --> 26:41.630
in having me in that position, that I had a couple 
options, and that I was willing to pursue those if

26:31.276 --> 26:41.630
he didn't want me in the position. And so he, he told 
me he wanted me in that position, he wanted me to

26:42.491 --> 26:48.460
stay, and so I agreed to do so. And I dropped that on 
the other way along. Frank Broyles was on the

26:51.123 --> 26:58.333
committee, looking for, searching for the new 
Chief Student Affairs Officer. And Frank Broyles

26:58.353 --> 27:01.097
called me, and Fred Horsinger, the chief 
financial officer up there. So they were both

27:08.064 --> 27:18.428
interested in, so I didn't tell them what I had 
done, but I called them back after I talked to them.

27:18.762 --> 27:19.884
We were happy here. Things had gone well. Didn't 
think they were going to change in regard to going

27:22.308 --> 27:26.235
well. And so I called them and told them. Maribel 
and I had talked it over and discussed it. We were

27:31.023 --> 27:31.784
happy here. And I did want to be considered for the 
job. Great. organizationally, were there any

27:37.443 --> 27:43.172
changes when Jarvis became the president in 
student affairs? We kept moving in the same

27:44.674 --> 27:48.540
direction that we had started in. The only 
difference was that Malin came down from

27:50.343 --> 28:02.522
placement and became an assistant to Jarvis, 
which meant We had someone right there in the

28:02.705 --> 28:07.592
office who we thought would be supportive. But it 
didn't change in regard to

28:08.434 --> 28:14.803
how we operated. Interestingly enough, 
administratively for me, Jarvis,

28:16.485 --> 28:31.648
never a time did I go to Jarvis's office and worry 
about how he was in terms of emotion. I could always

28:31.882 --> 28:35.507
go ahead with whatever it was. Jarvis blocked out 
the rest of the world and talked to me about

28:36.027 --> 28:43.437
anything and everything that we had on our agenda. 
So whereas with Dr. Williams, you know, I'd have to

28:44.138 --> 28:50.507
pick and choose. Timing this a little bit. And by 
the way, I've told this to a few people, but I had a

28:52.289 --> 28:58.457
statistics problem. It was just like Dr. 
Williams. I loved him to death, but he would, if you

29:01.430 --> 29:18.186
asked the wrong question, when he was feeling bad, 
found out later that his problem was ulcers, and

29:01.430 --> 29:18.186
when he was feeling bad, he'd jump all over your 
fanny for asking a stupid question. When he was in a

29:19.648 --> 29:27.896
good mood, you know, so it kind of reminded me of Dr. 
Williams, and then later, Frank Vandiver, same

29:19.648 --> 29:27.896
way. The high highs and the low lows. But with 
Jarvis, Jarvis was straight across. So it just

29:36.009 --> 29:37.851
continued along. Did the paper flow,

29:37.871 --> 29:45.522
getting a yes or a no answer, did that change much? 
No. For me, it was just the same. And the frequency

29:48.105 --> 29:57.358
of being able to get to him and meetings of the key 
administrators continued at about the same rate?

29:58.900 --> 29:59.200
Yep. We probably had... Jarvis started the 
breakfast with the key administrative staff. Dr.

30:07.063 --> 30:08.425
Williams didn't have those. And Dr. Williams 
didn't have many where he involved all the vice

30:09.586 --> 30:13.370
presidents. He primarily related to each vice 
president on his own. So the joint breakfast, that

30:17.616 --> 30:21.460
was a new thing with Jarvis. Perry Atkinson,

30:28.319 --> 30:32.706
By that time, had we gotten in the Howard Vest line? 
Yeah, I think so. Yeah. And so we had breakfast. And

30:38.594 --> 30:39.696
Walker, of course. Yeah,

30:39.716 --> 30:44.964
Bob Walker. So we had the breakfast. And Mac. And 
Mac. Hi. Let's go back and grab, who are the student

30:51.213 --> 30:57.583
leaders from those early years? that deserve 
mention. Steve Everhart, who was student body

31:02.092 --> 31:06.741
president the year after Randy Ross. Give a brief 
little description of talents or achievements.

31:11.149 --> 31:12.651
Steve was from New Chronicles. He was significant 
for a number of reasons. One, he went to Harvard Law

31:14.775 --> 31:18.662
School after he left here. And then, bless his 
heart.
