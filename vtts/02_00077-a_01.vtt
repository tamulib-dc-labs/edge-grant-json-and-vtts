one two three four five this is Friday December

00:02.512 --> 00:32.181
28th and we're in El Paso and I have the honor and 
pleasure of chatting with Larry Francis class of

00:02.512 --> 00:32.181
55

00:02.512 --> 00:32.181
Larry to introduce yourself to anyone that might 
hear this tape or read the transcription give a

00:02.512 --> 00:32.181
biographical summary of you and your life before 
you got to A&M. Where, what did mom and dad, what did

00:37.584 --> 00:40.467
they do? Where'd y'all live? I was born in San 
Antonio, Texas in 1933. My parents were born there

00:48.414 --> 01:00.825
and my father worked for the General Electric 
Company there and was transferred to El Paso in

00:48.414 --> 01:00.825
1941 just for World War II. So I completed almost 
all of my public education here other than the

01:02.890 --> 01:10.700
first grade.

01:14.565 --> 01:29.303
I went to grade school here and graduated from 
Austin High School in 1951

01:14.565 --> 01:29.303
and I did reasonably well as far as education marks 
in school and and had decided though that I was

01:30.818 --> 01:35.904
going to A&M probably in about 1939. Why? Because 
my older cousin was in the famous class of 42. They

01:42.472 --> 01:48.300
got his degree handed to him and he managed to stay 
alive across the Pacific. And I have a picture in

01:49.862 --> 01:56.590
front of their house in San Antonio in which he has 
his little Aggie bag with the sticker on the side of

01:57.650 --> 02:03.777
it, and I've got his hat on. So I knew I was going to 
A&M, I guess, from day one. And I was very

02:10.124 --> 02:11.185
fortunate. I, uh, I had never been outside

02:13.047 --> 02:25.041
of El Paso other than to San Antonio, Texas a few 
times to see relatives. I had been as far north as

02:26.337 --> 02:46.867
Philmont Scout Ranch once, and my parents took me 
to A&M and dropped me in my footlocker off that

02:26.337 --> 02:46.867
afternoon, and that was a long way from home. What 
did, as you recall, did anybody, mom or dad or

02:47.548 --> 02:52.516
anybody else, give you advice? They probably 
tried. and I probably thought I knew everything.

03:00.706 --> 03:20.526
But as far as you mean when I arrived at A&M, I think 
they expected me, number one, my parents were, my

03:00.706 --> 03:20.526
dad started out life unloading refrigerators out 
of boxcars for GE, and he was a clerk here, and he

03:00.706 --> 03:20.526
became the branch manager, but we never had a lot of 
money. I think about the main thing was they

03:22.261 --> 03:26.365
expected me to do well. I had, as I say, I was in the 
top 10% of my class at Austin High. They expected me

03:32.612 --> 03:37.237
to do well at A&M, and I enrolled in electrical 
engineering. They expected me to not spend any

03:38.238 --> 03:47.728
more money than I. I got $5 a week to cover 
everything, and I remember it was $50, I think, for

03:38.238 --> 03:47.728
tuition. Uh, they expected me to stay out of 
trouble and get a degree. Now, you had never

03:54.190 --> 03:56.733
visited the campus before you went to... I'd never 
been there in my life. ...before you went to

03:57.734 --> 03:58.836
enroll. The only thing I knew about Texas A&M was 
when I wrote off and got that manual, that book that

03:58.996 --> 04:08.248
described everything. As you, about how long were 
they there on that drop-off trip? Did you all spend

04:15.245 --> 04:16.547
the night? No, we had spent the night in Austin, 
Texas. And as I recall, I was supposed to be at

04:22.095 --> 04:31.629
Sabisa Dining Hall at 10 o'clock on whatever 
morning it was. We left Austin that morning early

04:33.232 --> 04:36.717
and got there about 9.30.

04:39.852 --> 04:40.533
I went in. There was a desk. I paid the fees. They 
gave me a room number over in Walton Hall. We were

04:50.383 --> 04:57.350
the first class back on campus, the freshmen from 
Bryan. I said, I'm ready. Y'all might as well

04:59.051 --> 05:01.193
leave. And they looked at me, and so by noon, they 
were gone. And that's the last time I saw my guests

05:05.553 --> 05:10.339
until Christmas when I came home. And there must 
have been somebody then from A&M kind of come in and

05:11.681 --> 05:18.130
tell you what to do. Well, the first one that there 
obviously was people there at Sabisa that said,

05:18.591 --> 05:27.663
well, now you're going to go through registration 
and you're going to do this and that. I don't

05:27.683 --> 05:29.325
remember too much about that. I do remember going 
over and putting that footlocker in that room.

05:34.112 --> 05:35.053
Now, I was fortunate. One of my high school 
classmates was also my roommate at A&M. He didn't

05:39.561 --> 05:40.583
finish there. And the first thing I remember was 
that night when the two, the juniors in my outfit,

05:42.345 --> 05:57.108
we had this meeting, I remember. And I thought, my 
God, what have I gotten into down here? And that's

06:02.757 --> 06:04.399
probably the first impression real 
impressionable meeting i had now is this when they

06:05.138 --> 06:34.842
explained to you they explained to me just how it 
was going to be and

06:05.138 --> 06:34.842
and as i recall and i was trying to think about this 
there was probably 25 or 30 graduates of austin

06:05.138 --> 06:34.842
high that enrolled down there at that time which 
was quite a few i think we had more than any time

06:05.138 --> 06:34.842
before There was probably another eight or 10 from 
El Paso High. I think there was about seven or eight

06:39.670 --> 06:42.133
from Isleta. And out of all of those, probably only 
eight of us graduated.

06:54.248 --> 06:57.993
When your parents drove away, how much money did 
you have in your pocket? Do you remember? It wasn't

06:58.934 --> 06:59.675
much. Probably no more than $10. My dad would send 
me $5 in cash in an envelope. The MSC had just

07:09.786 --> 07:11.588
opened. McKee had built it, and it had opened in 
May. I didn't know Robert E. McKee built that.

07:18.116 --> 07:18.837
Yeah. Marvelous. McKee built it, and it just 
opened. There were two post offices. One was in

07:24.864 --> 07:25.705
there. It's no longer where it was. It was up in the 
front at that time. The other one is still the old

07:30.550 --> 07:32.232
one at Northgate. Mm-hmm. And I had a box over at the 
MSC, even though I was at Walton. I'd go over there

07:37.846 --> 07:40.829
and get my five bucks on Friday. I'd get my 
haircuts, everything out of that. Now, as far as

07:44.293 --> 07:52.041
you recall, about what did it cost total to attend a 
semester or a year? Room, board, tuition, books.

07:57.526 --> 08:02.271
Books were, at that time, were about, it was just 
about as expensive as anything. As I recall, it

08:02.808 --> 08:09.454
seems like for a semester you could go to school 
down there for about $500. As

08:09.834 --> 08:16.560
you walked around the campus, describe the 
campus. Well, it was at a process of change at that

08:16.580 --> 08:19.563
time. The central part remains somewhat similar. 
Out in front of the academic building, there were

08:25.128 --> 08:29.732
two old buildings. One was Austin Hall where the 
The ROTC headquarters was. It subsequently moved

08:35.052 --> 08:37.514
to a building, and it's probably not there. They 
called it the Trigon over near Rudder. It's still

08:40.277 --> 08:40.838
there. Guyon was there. There was another one, a 
sister building to Austin on the other side of the

08:42.579 --> 08:49.786
main walk coming in. That one had just been torn 
down. They tore Austin down, I guess, my sophomore

08:51.748 --> 08:54.370
year. Electrical engineering was in Bolton Hall. 
It's no longer there. and its mirror image was a

09:00.031 --> 09:03.916
civil engineering building. Nagel. Nagel. The 
old M.E. building and shops, and that's probably

09:07.520 --> 09:15.950
the first time we all got in trouble, and I don't 
know how we lived. The M.E. shops were over there,

09:17.672 --> 09:22.517
the old sawtooth kind of factory building. A 
classmate in my outfit freshman year, Buck Gay,

09:27.908 --> 09:32.776
climbed up on the water tower to paint it one night, 
and believe it or not, fell off. And went right

09:35.201 --> 09:37.705
through the roof of the M.E. shop. That was that 
asbestos board. Left an outline, hit the floor,

09:41.091 --> 09:45.158
and he's still alive. In

09:47.568 --> 09:55.876
that footlocker, what kind of stuff did you bring 
with you? I didn't have a lot. That was one of the

09:56.937 --> 10:01.922
reasons that people like me went to A&M. You didn't 
have to have a lot of clothes. So I've often thought

10:04.044 --> 10:06.266
about that. I had maybe a couple of sports shirts 
and a pair of pants outside of underwear and

10:06.406 --> 10:15.955
toiletries.

10:16.441 --> 10:25.913
I'm not even sure that I had a heavy coat of any kind, 
because I remember everywhere I went, I had to wear

10:16.441 --> 10:25.913
that big old wool coat. And describe your room, 
what you and your roommate created. Well, it was

10:29.377 --> 10:38.809
one of those that, Walton's still there, and I 
don't know when it was built, but it was kind of a

10:29.377 --> 10:38.809
unique, and there was a couple of them on campus. 
There were two rooms and a bath between the two

10:39.470 --> 10:42.234
rooms. So instead of one big common bathroom, you 
had a And they were poured kind of marble floors and

10:46.124 --> 11:04.505
tile walls, and you had a bunk bed arrangement, a 
steel bunk bed, two desks, and two chairs, and that

10:46.124 --> 11:04.505
was it. Were you allowed to have a radio? Yes, I 
think we were, except it had to be off. by a certain

11:13.799 --> 11:14.680
time. You know, we came back, freshman year, you 
had to start studying right after, I think it was at

11:14.720 --> 11:21.005
seven, you had to start studying. And lights out, I 
think it was like 10 or 10.30, something like that.

11:26.470 --> 11:32.215
And of course, in electrical engineering, that's 
all I did was study. Now, you registered by

11:32.755 --> 11:36.239
standing in line at Sabisa? At Sabisa. How did you 
decide what courses to take? Who advised you?

11:41.323 --> 11:43.705
Well, as I recall, that was all predetermined. If 
you said you were going to study electrical

11:45.699 --> 11:49.565
engineering, they say here's what you have to 
take. In fact, it was in that book. One of the things

11:52.209 --> 12:01.103
that my children, two of them went there and I've 
often discussed with them and now my

11:52.209 --> 12:01.103
grandchildren hopefully are going to go there. 
They allowed us to take a lot more hours than they

12:02.465 --> 12:06.712
take now. I remember I used to take a minimum of 
about 17 or 18. I think one year I took 21. The reason

12:11.791 --> 12:25.333
I'm chuckling, the typical student today thinks 
that 12 hours is a full load and that 15 is a heavy

12:11.791 --> 12:25.333
load, and therefore they don't expect to graduate 
in five years. They don't. Maybe five and a half.

12:28.097 --> 12:33.005
And I tell them, no, our parents are going to kick 
our fanny if we didn't finish in four. Oh, yeah. I

12:35.373 --> 12:37.677
stayed on, I got a master's degree there. And I 
graduated in May and stayed on with summer school,

12:38.859 --> 12:50.938
both sessions in the fall and the spring, and got 
out with a second degree a year later. And that

12:52.100 --> 12:56.547
fall, do you remember any of those first year 
classes? Were any of those important to you?

12:59.271 --> 13:02.376
Describe some of those people, some of those 
courses. I remember the chemistry class that I

13:02.845 --> 13:09.993
hated dearly because the lab was on Friday 
afternoon, starting at 3. And if you want, my wife,

13:10.313 --> 13:19.823
who I had started dating in junior high, went to 
TSCW, which was considered the sister school. I

13:21.125 --> 13:26.571
had no car or anything, so on Friday evening, once a 
month, I'd hitchhike all the way to Denton. Well, I

13:27.351 --> 13:31.536
couldn't do that with that chemistry class. And, 
you know, the mechanical drafting. I must have

13:36.265 --> 13:50.703
lost 20 pounds down there because mechanical 
drafting was in the barracks south of, just at

13:36.265 --> 13:50.703
Southgate almost, well down below the stadium. 
And, you know, you'd have a class at the academic

13:50.723 --> 13:52.866
building. Then you had to be down there carrying 
that. We had those fishing tackle boxes with all of

13:56.510 --> 14:01.236
our drafting tools carrying your T-square. And 
away you'd go. And

14:04.832 --> 14:10.499
physics. I liked physics. I remember that class. I 
remember we had a mechanical engineering class of

14:13.983 --> 14:19.549
some kind. I forget what it was. It wasn't 
mechanical engineering. I enjoyed all those

14:24.055 --> 14:25.496
classes. And I made the best grades I made at A&M my 
freshman year. I made straight As my freshman

14:28.460 --> 14:30.362
year. What was the key to making those good grades? 
I had never studied so hard, and that's one of the

14:34.123 --> 14:39.430
things I think that A&M did. You know, it was called 
Huntsville on the Brazos and this, that, and the

14:41.233 --> 14:44.537
other. There was nothing else to do. And if you 
were, if you, I knew I had to get that degree. My

14:50.886 --> 14:58.797
cousin had gotten a degree, but out of that huge 
family of ours on both sides, I was the second one in

14:50.886 --> 14:58.797
that whole family that got a degree. And I had to get 
that degree. So I studied. Were there any of those

15:05.157 --> 15:13.012
teachers that first year that you now realize made 
a dent in your heart or your brain? A lot of them. And

15:15.016 --> 15:18.422
the irony is one of them was Dutch Dillingham. His 
younger brother, who was a lot younger, is a very

15:20.579 --> 15:29.215
good friend of mine, still alive, Mike 
Dillingham, and we go to all the football games. We

15:29.475 --> 15:30.397
have season tickets. And that's kind of an irony, 
because Dutch was involved in the first radio

15:32.040 --> 15:40.074
broadcast of a football game.

15:40.775 --> 15:44.983
But he was very good. You know, I don't remember too 
many of the math professors, freshman, well, I

15:46.769 --> 15:55.821
think we took algebra, and I don't remember too 
many of those. In those days, you didn't have very

15:56.762 --> 15:59.085
many instructors. You had the professors. In 
chemistry, we had an instructor, and I think in

16:01.207 --> 16:05.293
math, we had an instructor.

16:07.976 --> 16:11.060
I remember the mechanical engineering, I mean, 
civil engineering. That's what it was. We took

16:11.701 --> 16:12.642
surveys. I remember going around that campus, and 
I forget his name though, but he was a great guy.

16:21.889 --> 16:25.754
We had a lot of good professors over in the 
E-Department in those days, Hallmark. And did you

16:27.576 --> 16:33.203
engineering majors think that you were the cream 
of crop? Was there a great pride in the

16:33.223 --> 16:35.226
engineering? Well, maybe some of them did. I guess 
I never gave it that much thought. I think we, I

16:41.950 --> 16:51.919
think the engineering majors thought they 
studied more than the rest of them, but I don't know

16:41.950 --> 16:51.919
that we thought we were any smarter than the rest of 
them. What was your outfit? What outfit were you

16:53.340 --> 16:54.502
in? Well, I was in the Air Force, and I was in, 
originally in, and I forget the outfit number as a

16:54.522 --> 17:01.888
freshman. We were up in, as I say, in Walton. Then I 
was in Squadron 14. Did it have a nickname? In those

17:10.756 --> 17:13.339
days, we didn't. And then my junior year, I was on 
the fourth group staff. And then I was going to be

17:17.584 --> 17:20.728
the CEO of the fourth group. But my wife, who was a 
lot smarter than I was, graduated from college in

17:22.210 --> 17:28.297
three years with a teaching degree. So that 
summer, we decided to get married. And she taught

17:31.280 --> 17:33.443
high school in Bryan, Texas. In fact, taught 
Travis Bryan III in the first grade. Really? Oh,

17:37.628 --> 17:38.569
my, my. So we rented a house first from old man 
Lauderstein, and then from Chris Gronemann, who

17:39.933 --> 17:52.980
was head of the industrial engineering 
department, built some new duplexes south side

17:39.933 --> 17:52.980
there. So I was in what was called the day ducks my 
senior year. Back to your freshman year, when did

17:59.983 --> 18:08.032
you and your buddies get introduced to A&M 
traditions? When did they line you all up in the

18:08.372 --> 18:14.540
hallway and start explaining things to you and how 
it was going to be and what was going to happen?

18:14.680 --> 18:16.001
Well, that was the first night. Describe that. 
Well, you know, they got us at attention. And, of

18:21.968 --> 18:23.710
course, none of us really knew how to get And they 
were screaming at us, and they were hollering at

18:25.208 --> 18:27.891
us. And they went through all of this about what we 
were going to do and what we weren't going to do, and

18:28.352 --> 18:35.600
that we were the most ignorant people in the world. 
We weren't going to walk on the grass. And it went on

18:38.704 --> 18:41.527
and on and on and on. And

18:43.529 --> 18:54.422
I think what I saw, my older cousin who had 
graduated used to come home in 39, and I remember

18:55.786 --> 19:04.921
they beat their rear end constantly down there. I 
think I was prepared,

19:07.124 --> 19:18.563
and so it didn't bother me as much as a lot of them 
left within two or three days.

19:21.247 --> 19:22.249
Did you ever think about leaving? I wanted I told my 
dad when I came home Christmas I said I uh this is

19:23.512 --> 19:52.894
just too tough and I think I want to come home and he 
says well you can think all you want but you're

19:23.512 --> 19:52.894
going back that's your that's your only option so 
that was the best thing that ever happened I

19:23.512 --> 19:52.894
enjoyed my time at A&M right now you didn't have 
that freshman year particularly you didn't have

19:23.512 --> 19:52.894
any troubles with grades Explain why you did so 
well that first year academically. You know, I

19:58.419 --> 20:00.041
don't know why. I think my makeup is I'm kind of 
persistent. And there was a very close friend of

20:09.531 --> 20:13.616
mine. His father was in the Isleta school system. 
He was our class salutatorian at Austin High.

20:22.525 --> 20:23.286
Brilliant. And he was in my outfit, too, from here. 
And his grades were terrible, and he had to leave.

20:34.925 --> 20:39.711
He ended up going to the University of Virginia, 
and I never heard about him again, but I assume he

20:34.925 --> 20:39.711
did quite well. He just wasn't, he wasn't smart. 
Just didn't fit. I think there was a lot of them were

20:45.419 --> 20:47.822
in constant fear, though. Now, was there any 
circumstance, any event or situation that first

20:49.017 --> 20:59.407
semester or first year where you needed to go seek 
advice from anybody? No. I

21:02.090 --> 21:06.815
don't think in the four years I was there. I only had 
one time that I almost got kicked out of school. I

21:12.661 --> 21:17.185
was in the Ross Volunteers.

21:17.941 --> 21:43.830
and they you know it was they beat our butt one night 
at a party and the administration heard about it

21:17.941 --> 21:43.830
and there were about 10 of us sitting on we thought 
this was going to help on blocks of ice in the

21:17.941 --> 21:43.830
restroom in the dorm and they came in and of course 
did an inspection and caught every one of us and it

21:44.468 --> 22:11.218
took them about three days you know because they we 
were we knew if you allowed it to happen it was much

21:44.468 --> 22:11.218
your fault as oh okay and we I thought we were all 
gonna get kicked out of school who was the

21:44.468 --> 22:11.218
president during that time Harrington did you 
ever have a class with him by chance no see he goes

21:44.468 --> 22:11.218
way back to class of 22 his wife's still living Ruth 
from Plano, and the Harrington family in Plano was

22:11.587 --> 22:31.852
almost the key, key family of what was then a little 
bitty country farming town, because I lived in

22:11.587 --> 22:31.852
Garland until I was 10, only about eight miles 
away, and they had the farm oil dealership, a

22:11.587 --> 22:31.852
furniture store, and they were also the 
morticians, so that... They were everything. The

22:33.634 --> 22:36.918
coming and going, they took care of. At that 
hazing, though, Well, did they beat you all for a

22:39.970 --> 22:44.296
purpose or was it just part of the initiation? 
Well, it wasn't even an initiation. We had a beer

22:47.300 --> 22:49.903
bust. The RVs marched, I don't know if they still 
do, in the King Rex Parade as the honor guard and we

22:50.504 --> 23:05.164
came back from that and we had this end of the year 
kind of April beer bust somewhere off campus. You

23:05.644 --> 23:06.345
were a junior? I was a junior. And the seniors 
decided it was time that, and that, it was just one

23:08.118 --> 23:14.913
of those things. What kind of paddles did they use? 
Big boards, you know, the ones that are cut out.

23:20.145 --> 23:21.247
About a one by six? No, no, they're, yeah, well, 
they were one inch lumber, you know, cut. about

23:26.410 --> 23:54.190
that long and do you remember about how many spats 
did everybody get oh about six or seven something

23:26.410 --> 23:54.190
like that and then did all of the sophomore i mean 
all the juniors yeah but only about six or eight of

23:26.410 --> 23:54.190
us for some reason got caught the other ones either 
disappeared conveniently or i don't remember

23:26.410 --> 23:54.190
what happened did that did the administration 
call y'all in oh yeah and told us that you knew what

23:54.625 --> 23:58.378
the consequences were. All right. According to 
the administration, you should have just

23:59.944 --> 24:04.219
refused. Which would have meant? you wouldn't 
have been accepted you're not going to do that and

24:07.889 --> 24:30.538
they knew that i think they were just trying to put 
the fear of god into it let's see back to uh back to

24:07.889 --> 24:30.538
that uh that freshman year though oh there was a 
picnic by the way you go back to battalion at that

24:07.889 --> 24:30.538
time it would have been in uh 19 spring of what 54. 
They had a big cartoon on the editorial page of us

24:32.138 --> 24:42.751
sitting on blocks of ice.

24:42.771 --> 24:45.534
Now Jim Earl's not one of your contemporaries, is 
he? Cadet Slouch? Yeah, he started while I was

24:47.156 --> 24:48.558
there. They live not far from us and we see them 
quite often. Back to that freshman year, did they

24:53.985 --> 25:00.913
haul you all out in the hallway and give you 
lectures and Well, they couldn't call us in the

25:01.265 --> 25:03.948
hallway and walk. Oh, that's right. Well, where 
did they, yeah, where did they? They had that day

25:06.732 --> 25:10.736
room up there that they got us all in. And that's 
where you'd hit a brace? Yeah. What kinds of things

25:13.340 --> 25:16.023
did they make you fish do? Oh,

25:18.025 --> 25:22.791
what was it? We were always doing something. 
Push-ups? No, you know, there wasn't that much of

25:27.176 --> 25:31.221
that.

25:32.332 --> 25:41.560
Things were, one of the things I've noticed, 
they've kind of formalized or made this more in the

25:32.332 --> 25:41.560
Corps. These push-ups they do, things were kind of 
laid back. Cadet Slouch epitomized the Corps in

25:45.904 --> 25:51.029
that day. We were always running errands and for 
those guys, cleaning their room. I don't know how

26:00.209 --> 26:03.492
many times I had to clean that guy's room. Describe 
for your fish year your routine on a class day. What

26:11.520 --> 26:15.003
time did you get up, what did you do when, and when 
did you finally get to go to sleep? Well, you get up,

26:15.424 --> 26:28.056
as I recall, I think about 6 a.m. And you get cleaned 
up, shaved,

26:15.424 --> 26:28.056
and out in formation. to march to every meal. Boy, 
that got old, especially when it was raining, and

26:30.841 --> 26:34.466
it rains a lot. And in those days, we had those 
ponchos. We didn't have raincoats. We had those

26:39.973 --> 26:47.803
doggone ponchos, and they called them pisspots, 
the helmet liners, and your uniform.

26:48.744 --> 26:56.895
And we'd march up from the dorms down below Walton, 
and we'd march over to Sebesa. for breakfast. Now,

26:59.846 --> 27:06.995
a lot of the guys who just couldn't get up in one of 
that extra 10 or 15 minutes would have on nothing

26:59.846 --> 27:06.995
but underwear. And if it was raining hard, the 
upperclassmen were about as out of it as we were,

27:07.716 --> 27:13.543
and they wouldn't see. And the way we'd go, you'd 
come back and clean up your room. And by then, it was

27:21.272 --> 27:24.176
time for your 8 o'clock class. Now, when did you 
clean up that upperclassman's room? Oh, usually

27:27.790 --> 27:29.372
at night. Oh, okay. And I did, you know, my roommate 
and I cleaned that guy, PJ. Well, I'm not going to

27:37.000 --> 27:37.701
say. Anyway, we cleaned his room. Neat guy, really 
was. And he was a little baddie rooster and

27:43.287 --> 27:46.451
immaculate. Uniforms, you know. And after about, 
I remember it was just before Christmas, we'd had

27:50.796 --> 27:56.262
about enough of that. So we both filled trash cans 
with water, went over there in the middle of the

27:57.693 --> 28:02.220
night. He didn't lock his door, walked in there and 
dumped it all over him and took off. Of course, he

28:07.107 --> 28:11.934
found us real quick because we dropped the ash cans 
and he knew who they belonged to.

28:15.319 --> 28:17.141
And what punishment did you get then? Oh, he had us 
out. The bull ring, they called it on Saturday,

28:21.588 --> 28:25.033
marching tours. and we had to clean the room even 
more, and we were always running errands. But you

28:31.244 --> 28:35.330
didn't mention a paddle or anything like that? You 
know, I never got my butt beat at A&M other than at

28:35.350 --> 28:41.658
the RVs. I'm glad you mentioned that. Now, there 
was a lot of them that did, but the guys in the

28:45.043 --> 28:50.650
outfits I wore, What other kind of good bull do you 
remember when you were a fish that you or anybody

28:52.756 --> 28:57.602
else did? Oh, gosh.

29:04.271 --> 29:05.293
What do I remember? I remember going over to UT in 
Austin my freshman year before the game, and then

29:06.995 --> 29:22.375
about six of them, I think, decided after a few few 
too many beers. Of course, we were only eighteen

29:24.774 --> 29:26.496
years old.

29:29.721 --> 29:32.124
Going over there and painting their fountain or 
something. Now, I didn't go, and they got caught,

29:32.244 --> 29:43.079
and they came back to school all shaved and painted 
orange.

29:44.621 --> 29:45.662
You know, I can remember going up to see my wife, 
who's now my wife, and I never had any money. And I

29:53.007 --> 29:57.112
loved to go up there because they had good food at 
the time, I thought. And Tom Dahlheit, who went to

29:58.173 --> 30:06.003
Isleta High, was on the track team here at Isleta, 
was on the track team at A&M. He went up there with

30:06.904 --> 30:08.005
me. And we never had any money, and we'd come back on 
Sunday hitchhiking. We got as far as Waco.

30:15.930 --> 30:20.935
Somebody gave us a ride to Waco, out in the country 
south of Waco. We were waiting for another ride,

30:21.476 --> 30:24.960
and we were starving to death. Tom was raised on a 
farm. He looks over the fence, and here's a bunch of

30:27.262 --> 30:29.384
chickens. He says, I'm going to fix this lunch. I 
said, what are you going to do? He went over that

30:34.049 --> 30:42.278
fence and grabbed a chicken and wrung its neck, 
plucked it, and then went under the viaduct there

30:34.049 --> 30:42.278
and built a fire roasted that chicken i almost 
threw up i

30:43.186 --> 31:12.332
mean that's how poor i guess we were i don't know in 
hitchhiking how long did it normally take you to go

30:43.186 --> 31:12.332
to or from then oh at least five hours and where was 
the hardest place to get through dallas or fort

30:43.186 --> 31:12.332
worth well we'd go through dallas no but i mean was 
it hard to get a ride through dallas

31:16.666 --> 31:18.529
I don't recall it being that hard. I think the 
hardest place was getting out of Denton

31:18.549 --> 31:26.683
sometimes, and a lot of times you'd get to Waco or 
someplace and have a hard time getting home. I

31:27.384 --> 31:35.698
remember two or three of us were picked up on the 
north side of Dallas one Sunday morning about 9

31:27.384 --> 31:35.698
o'clock by a guy in a big Cadillac. Turns out he 
wasn't a very savory character, I don't think.

31:43.497 --> 31:45.743
And, you know, we wore our uniforms. He thought we 
were stupid.
