WEBVTT

00:03.406 --> 00:04.669
You know, he whipped out.

00:07.896 --> 00:10.482
So I said, you know whose parking place you're in?

00:11.304 --> 00:14.111
He said, no, sir, I just saw it as an open parking place.

00:14.171 --> 00:15.594
I said, well, that's my parking place.

00:15.614 --> 00:16.637
He said, well, I'll move my car.

00:16.657 --> 00:17.779
I said, no, you won't.

00:17.799 --> 00:19.142
You'll keep your car there.

00:19.884 --> 00:22.410
You are now my driver, and that's my car.

00:23.521 --> 00:33.913
And so Ross, when we got ready to make a beer run, Fish Margraves, yes sir, get our car warmed up.

00:36.156 --> 00:40.361
And we'd take him along and we took him to Austin and all kinds of things.

00:40.481 --> 00:43.064
He was dating this girl in Houston when we'd come to Houston.

00:43.084 --> 00:45.006
He'd drive us back and forth.

00:45.408 --> 00:48.272
We just kind of commandeered things as we went along.

00:49.714 --> 00:52.238
And you were still majoring in business.

00:53.019 --> 00:53.099
Yep.

00:53.119 --> 00:58.607
Were there any courses that senior year that you remember that were important later?

00:59.568 --> 01:02.873
Well, you know, I had to get through statistics, which was the killer in business.

01:03.674 --> 01:05.938
And it wasn't important.

01:07.280 --> 01:07.760
Let's see.

01:07.820 --> 01:09.002
Who was...

01:10.771 --> 01:12.774
What was that guy that taught statistics?

01:12.794 --> 01:14.317
That was a killer in business.

01:16.400 --> 01:17.542
Doctor somebody.

01:17.783 --> 01:18.624
How well did you do?

01:18.644 --> 01:19.906
Do you remember?

01:19.926 --> 01:22.731
I had to make at least a C and I did.

01:22.751 --> 01:25.014
I hated statistics.

01:26.697 --> 01:28.180
Then I went to work for Prudential.

01:29.101 --> 01:31.265
As an insurance major, I'd had statistics.

01:31.345 --> 01:33.969
Hell, they thought I was brilliant because they had all these guys.

01:33.989 --> 01:35.732
They had hired this management program.

01:35.712 --> 01:38.416
And they didn't understand anything about statistics.

01:38.456 --> 01:40.939
And the one-eyed man, I was king in the land of the blind.

01:40.980 --> 01:42.522
You're talking about just falling in it.

01:43.303 --> 01:47.549
So I went to work for Prudential.

01:48.230 --> 01:51.194
Then I had to leave because they wrote my draft board.

01:51.274 --> 01:56.462
And a guy was a friend of my dad who said, unless Jack wants to carry an M1, he needs to join something by Thursday.

01:57.062 --> 01:59.706
So I sprinted out and joined the United States Coast Guard.

01:59.846 --> 02:01.008
But that's after you graduated.

02:01.028 --> 02:03.812
That's after I graduated.

02:03.792 --> 02:09.402
So then I come back to Prudential and they rotate you through different departments in this program.

02:09.963 --> 02:13.590
So they sent me out to sales and they said, where do you want to be?

02:13.610 --> 02:15.413
I said, they gave me these things.

02:15.433 --> 02:16.335
I said, I'll take Temple.

02:16.776 --> 02:18.098
They said, why do you want to go to Temple?

02:18.118 --> 02:20.603
I said, it's near Fort Hood and I got a bunch of buddies down there.

02:21.275 --> 02:27.631
And I was single, so they'd march all their troops in, and they'd say, this is Mr. Raines, our insurance officer.

02:27.711 --> 02:31.421
Okay, man, upper left-hand corner, last name, first name, middle initial.

02:31.942 --> 02:33.566
Now, the next line's your serial number.

02:33.606 --> 02:34.749
Sergeant, help that man.

02:35.050 --> 02:37.596
It's on his dog tags around this thing.

02:37.576 --> 02:54.842
So they took me out to Phoenix because they had a big convention out there that they wanted me to give a speech about how a young man could join Prudential and in his first six months there sell a million dollars in insurance.

02:54.822 --> 02:55.663
Phenomenal.

02:56.003 --> 02:59.608
I told him I'd read the manuals and taken a course they'd given me and I followed that.

03:00.028 --> 03:08.499
The president of the company was at the head table, jumped up, ran up there and said, I just want this young man does what he's told.

03:08.699 --> 03:11.763
He reads those manuals and he does that.

03:12.183 --> 03:17.590
And if we could get more people, we've invested millions in this program and this young man's benefit.

03:17.570 --> 03:23.309
And I'm thinking, listens to and follows direction, and they're going to find out about me one day and come and get me.

03:23.651 --> 03:26.219
But I was doing the same thing I did at A&M.

03:26.380 --> 03:27.664
Innovate, you know.

03:28.015 --> 03:32.640
They taught you that in military tactics.

03:32.660 --> 03:34.522
So the Aggie training was coming in.

03:35.604 --> 03:42.191
Other than Rudder, who were some other impressive characters of A&M?

03:42.231 --> 03:54.305
Wayne Stark was not a character, but he took time, and he would talk to you, and he and Gene were just lovely people, and I was genuinely fond of them, and then our friendship really grew afterwards.

03:55.206 --> 03:57.769
Kutesh and Denton, I've told you how important

03:58.188 --> 03:59.030
They were to me.

03:59.110 --> 04:04.842
Colonel Melcher was just, you know, we stayed friends after even, you know, when I was in other outfits.

04:05.423 --> 04:06.826
Old Army Lou, did you know him?

04:06.846 --> 04:07.567
Oh, yeah.

04:07.587 --> 04:19.892
In fact, my senior year, his nephew out of Dallas came to A&M, and Lou came over and looked me up, and he said, my nephew is going to be in your outfit.

04:20.311 --> 04:23.497
And said, I've looked at the roster and said, Reigns, I know you.

04:24.539 --> 04:25.501
Take care of him.

04:25.521 --> 04:28.547
I said, Lou, you got it.

04:28.888 --> 04:29.850
Was Pinky still there?

04:30.211 --> 04:31.293
Pinky was alive.

04:31.333 --> 04:33.798
He was getting kind of senile.

04:33.818 --> 04:37.425
And, you know, he used to be, every time you'd come in the lounge,

04:38.063 --> 04:43.293
over here and he went all dodging because, you know, you'd heard every story 50 times.

04:45.136 --> 04:47.120
Let's see, some other traditions.

04:48.041 --> 04:48.983
Did you go to muster?

04:49.544 --> 04:50.145
Absolutely.

04:50.386 --> 04:51.107
Where was it held?

04:51.928 --> 04:58.300
Well, you know, the musters that I attended on campus,

05:00.068 --> 05:24.321
uh at the msc i recall we had uh out on the steps yeah out on the steps there and i don't ever recall going to maybe we had one in g raleigh i'm that uh what did i think it would probably it was g raleigh if it was going to rain or something you know but what did those symbolize to you as a young man well it i'll tell you what it you know it hit me

05:25.212 --> 05:43.435
at a muster that I was a part of something that was more than just going to school and, you know, it hit me that there was a continuum here that, in fact, I was invited back by the students to be a muster speaker in the voices of a proud tradition.

05:43.495 --> 05:49.183
If you've ever read that publication, I'm proud to have been included in there in the first publication.

05:49.263 --> 05:55.050
And in my muster speech, I said, in fact, I'll show you out here

05:55.030 --> 06:03.484
The kid sent me the next year to muster, they used the line, that strong maroon line marches on.

06:03.524 --> 06:15.744
And that was, I realized that I was a part of a continuum of something that is stretched through not only the history of A&M, but it embodies what Western civilization is about.

06:16.225 --> 06:20.211
And that's where one generation sacrifices and gives to the next.

06:20.191 --> 06:25.496
and you strengthen the line, you're a part of something that's much larger than you.

06:25.916 --> 06:32.903
It's Christianity without Christ, it borders on a religion.

06:33.383 --> 06:37.267
And I tell people that and they kind of look at you and they say that's sacrilegious.

06:37.347 --> 06:43.112
I don't mean it in that sense, but to me it is like that feeling.

06:44.713 --> 06:46.215
Does that make any sense to you?

06:48.197 --> 06:49.658
When did you buy your senior ring?

06:50.245 --> 06:54.350
As soon as I could, and I went every day to the mailbox in Port Arthur to see, you know.

06:55.711 --> 06:57.073
And do you remember what it cost?

06:57.854 --> 07:01.819
Not much, 60 bucks or something like that, and the former students paid a half of it.

07:02.279 --> 07:03.801
Have you ever lost it?

07:03.981 --> 07:05.763
No, still haven't.

07:05.963 --> 07:12.571
Things have been around the world, God only knows how many times, and there's been every hell hole in the world.

07:12.711 --> 07:17.637
Do you have any good Aggie Ring stories where somebody saw it at a...

07:17.684 --> 07:27.964
Let me tell you, 3D International, you go out there on the corner of San Felipe and Loop 16 and the building still sits there and it's my company that sold my interest to the employees.

07:28.552 --> 07:32.416
We built that company with a simple marketing strategy.

07:33.577 --> 07:40.163
I joined Vic Newhouse and there were 25 guys and we had, that first year, they had 500,000 in revenues.

07:40.864 --> 07:50.073
The last year I was there, we had had over 1,000 employees and we were doing work in 26 states and had offices in 12 foreign countries.

07:51.494 --> 07:55.858
We did 2 billion in construction that year.

07:55.838 --> 07:58.043
Aggies played a big part in that.

07:58.163 --> 08:08.064
When we got ready to go to another part of the world, I would take my directory of former students, Cross Index, the country that it was in, go back and find them.

08:08.645 --> 08:12.193
Hell, I could send an email, Mohammed, you know,

08:12.173 --> 08:16.398
I recall fondly our days at Bazell Hall.

08:16.618 --> 08:19.842
I will be, you know, in country at so-and-so and so-and-so.

08:19.862 --> 08:21.384
I'll call for an appointment.

08:21.404 --> 08:24.347
You know, Muhammad would go crazy trying to figure out where he met me.

08:24.407 --> 08:26.730
But, you know, I said Bazell Hall.

08:26.770 --> 08:27.671
He was at A&M.

08:28.231 --> 08:31.115
You know, this must have been one of those crazy guys.

08:31.575 --> 08:34.178
And they'd see me and, you know, we'd start.

08:34.419 --> 08:37.422
And suddenly you had, wherever you went, you had a network.

08:38.228 --> 08:42.213
And, you know, I had a Chinese Aggie partner.

08:42.233 --> 08:43.735
I had an Indian Aggie partner.

08:44.296 --> 08:47.260
I have Arabian Aggie partners, you know.

08:48.382 --> 08:55.952
Has that ring ever helped you get a special place to stay when the hotel was full or a table?

08:55.972 --> 08:57.374
Well, of course, all those guys.

08:57.454 --> 09:03.582
I mean, when I went into any country, I had immediately some powerful friends.

09:04.082 --> 09:06.025
And whatever problem I had,

09:06.241 --> 09:07.665
They were delighted to solve.

09:07.725 --> 09:18.653
Look, if the phone rings, the guy says, Rains, I'm here, you know, from Nepal, and this is my first trip to Houston, but we were together at A&M, and I'm trying to get this done in Houston.

09:18.673 --> 09:20.217
Now, what the hell do you think I'm going to do?

09:20.686 --> 09:25.711
You know, everything that guy needs, we're going to, you know, make sure he's taken care of.

09:26.172 --> 09:28.794
It's like part of being a large extended family.

09:29.755 --> 09:32.999
Like a friend of mine said, he said, hell, y'all are Jews with uniforms.

09:35.561 --> 09:38.905
This was a Jew who said that, so I'm going to let the record reflect that.

09:39.546 --> 09:43.169
And he went to the University of Georgia, played ball there, and was an ROTC.

09:44.611 --> 09:46.693
Why are Aggie rings so treasured?

09:47.652 --> 10:12.698
Well, it's a physical manifestation that you have, one, achieved something that you worked hard to do, two, it tells other people that you're proud of it, and three, it identifies you to the brotherhood and sisterhood, the fraternity of Aggies, which transcends all the Greek fraternities and other bullshit.

10:12.678 --> 10:15.082
What do you want done with yours when you are no more?

10:16.104 --> 10:17.406
That is up to my family.

10:17.646 --> 10:18.848
I have three.

10:19.910 --> 10:20.772
Sherry is 81.

10:21.132 --> 10:22.134
Misty is 85.

10:22.194 --> 10:23.136
And Tom's 90.

10:23.236 --> 10:25.660
And Sherry has her own.

10:25.760 --> 10:26.601
Misty doesn't.

10:26.621 --> 10:28.765
And Tom doesn't.

10:28.825 --> 10:30.929
And he'll probably wind up with it, I guess.

10:30.949 --> 10:36.458
But I'm going to leave enough crap for them to, you know, split up mementos and things.

10:36.674 --> 10:37.958
Did you buy senior boots?

10:38.821 --> 10:39.242
I did.

10:39.303 --> 10:41.370
How much did they cost?

10:41.711 --> 10:46.667
I bought a Sabre on anticipation because originally I was scheduled

10:47.120 --> 10:48.402
be a two diamond man.

10:48.422 --> 10:50.785
They took care of that for me when they threw me out.

10:51.026 --> 10:54.311
But I left in that state of limbo.

10:56.394 --> 10:59.799
So a buddy of mine said, I want you to have my saber.

11:01.481 --> 11:03.744
I said, well, he said, take it.

11:03.965 --> 11:07.430
You know, I'll either get it back from you or you can pay me for it.

11:08.131 --> 11:13.819
I bought some secondhand boots over at Hollix because

11:14.525 --> 11:18.611
It was a guy who I'd shined his boots when he was a senior.

11:19.452 --> 11:29.426
They went to another guy, and then he had, they had not been worn one year, and he wanted me to wear them my senior year, and I bought them from him, and I sold them afterwards.

11:29.607 --> 11:30.007
How much is that?

11:30.027 --> 11:30.768
Do you remember how much?

11:30.828 --> 11:33.011
Oh, a hundred and something bucks, you know.

11:35.315 --> 11:39.621
It, you know, I know people that ordered and got new boots and all.

11:39.781 --> 11:41.764
Hell, I couldn't begin to.

11:43.550 --> 11:45.595
Now, you didn't wear them that often then, did you?

11:45.615 --> 11:45.735
No.

11:46.376 --> 11:47.559
No.

11:48.581 --> 11:53.052
Final review, that's... I'll show you some upstairs when we go up there.

11:53.252 --> 11:56.800
When you went through final review as a senior, how did you feel?

11:58.113 --> 12:05.847
Well, first a sense of relief because I knew I was going to graduate at Final Review and that was a big load off my shoulders.

12:06.829 --> 12:11.718
And, you know, because you had Final Review and you had that whole day.

12:11.778 --> 12:13.742
Mother was there and it meant a lot to her.

12:14.380 --> 12:23.494
And she was very proud, and I think my dad was, but dad was a kind of, yeah, he was still mad I didn't go to Baylor, I think.

12:23.514 --> 12:24.256
I don't know.

12:24.396 --> 12:26.499
He was proud of me, but.

12:26.519 --> 12:31.427
And how soon before you opened that diploma, to be sure, it was yours and your name was on it?

12:31.964 --> 12:35.971
Oh, well, that's, you know, you did that, you know, as soon as you got back to that seat.

12:37.113 --> 12:41.581
How well did you feel that A&M had prepared you for the real world?

12:41.942 --> 12:46.530
Oh, I think A&M, A&M teaches you far more than you learn in a classroom.

12:46.811 --> 12:48.434
I didn't learn a damn thing in a classroom.

12:48.634 --> 12:50.698
I wasted four years

12:50.678 --> 12:55.466
squandered a wonderful opportunity and, you know, they should have kicked my ass around.

12:56.368 --> 13:03.681
And, you know, I was cursed with the ability to do what it took.

13:03.701 --> 13:06.085
A&M was not challenging academically.

13:06.746 --> 13:12.316
And so I was going to do whatever, you know, if the bar had been higher, I would have gotten over the bar.

13:12.797 --> 13:15.522
But if the bar was low, which it was then,

13:16.261 --> 13:21.275
You know, I got over the bar and that left me with 85% of my time to fuck off.

13:21.295 --> 13:27.191
And I did that with the same intensity that later I applied to becoming successful.

13:28.354 --> 13:30.540
What creates this Aggie spirit?

13:31.972 --> 13:44.826
Shared experiences, there's a commitment to the same goals, same value system that's reinforced in the whole culture of what it is.

13:45.146 --> 13:47.789
Are there some key events in that shared experience?

13:47.809 --> 13:50.232
Well, you know, but the whole thing is service above self.

13:50.312 --> 13:57.320
First thing they teach you is, you know, that any good military outfit does or anything that's bad, look, you know, you are a piece of shit.

13:57.380 --> 13:58.441
You're not important.

13:58.461 --> 14:00.223
What's important is,

14:00.642 --> 14:06.991
The unit, the institution, what we embody, the ideals, that's what's important.

14:07.071 --> 14:07.973
You are not.

14:08.533 --> 14:17.186
And that's very important for people to learn and always keep in mind because, you know, they used to have the slavehold, you know, all famously.

14:18.167 --> 14:24.476
And the higher you go, more people are blowing smoke up your ass and more, you know, you get to feel like that.

14:24.557 --> 14:29.704
But if you're a part of the Aggie family, they're never going to let you get too puffed up.

14:32.030 --> 14:37.556
We may have already asked this in a different way.

14:37.656 --> 14:40.479
What did you learn at A&M that's been important in your life?

14:41.621 --> 14:49.169
Well, A&M reinforced what my mother and daddy had always taught me, which is, you know, basic fundamental values.

14:49.289 --> 14:57.178
And, you know, I'll share a foxhole any day with an Aggie or just like a wood member of my family.

14:57.218 --> 15:00.602
I mean, you know, you can count on them.

15:02.354 --> 15:16.377
The thing that Aggies have going for them, people might make some joke about an Aggie or this, that, or the other, but by God, in their heart of hearts, everybody, you know, when it's time to choose up sides in a fight, they want you on their side.

15:17.299 --> 15:19.182
And the reason is because you can count on them.

15:20.705 --> 15:22.067
There isn't any quid in them.

15:23.667 --> 15:32.939
All right, now I've got about three or four more summary questions about this, but what I haven't asked many other people, let's go beyond.

15:33.619 --> 15:43.672
Share with this machine some of the important decisions that you have been involved in regarding A&M since you graduated.

15:44.052 --> 15:49.519
Well, a great, you know, I sent you all that.

15:50.500 --> 15:52.543
You've got all the bio data and all the stuff.

15:53.401 --> 16:00.108
The thing that, I had the chance to chair the Academic Task Force on the Target 2000.

16:01.249 --> 16:12.561
And just as you did, and we read your report that Dr. Bob Schutz, if he's still around, you ought to talk to him about all that.

16:13.002 --> 16:19.729
Because I've followed closely what they did this time, and they all said, yeah, we read all,

16:19.709 --> 16:24.278
You know, and I got several of them calling me about, Raines, when y'all said so-and-so, what went on this?

16:25.301 --> 16:27.545
Same thing you had.

16:30.692 --> 16:38.528
Back to that report that you were... Oh, the Target 2000.

16:39.267 --> 16:49.470
There were three parts to it, you know, the agricultural extension, the engineering extension, and which really dealt with those schools and those things.

16:50.192 --> 16:54.541
But they gave me the center slice, which was the academic test one.

16:54.561 --> 16:57.107
And let me pick a bunch of people

16:57.847 --> 17:06.004
that I wanted on there, and I asked Larry Fouracre to serve on there, which he was dean at Harvard, and we got Woody Varner.

17:06.064 --> 17:09.171
I'd heard about him at Nebraska and what he had done.

17:09.191 --> 17:16.125
I knew Dr. Lorena Rogers and Dr. Mickey LaMader, and they agreed to serve, and, you know, I mean, there's...

17:16.105 --> 17:17.147
There were two groups.

17:17.307 --> 17:18.929
Why the hell do you want a bunch of T-Sips?

17:19.230 --> 17:22.114
How the hell did you talk them into coming down and spending all this time at A&M?

17:22.154 --> 17:22.855
They were delighted.

17:23.416 --> 17:27.142
I got Dr. Bill Lemon down at the University of Texas, Galveston.

17:27.603 --> 17:37.658
People that I had met, and we had a good bunch of the A&M family, but I wanted a bunch of people outside the A&M family that brought a different perspective and viewpoint.

17:38.330 --> 17:45.862
And so if I made a contribution, it was bringing those people up.

17:45.882 --> 17:57.502
The key to success for me in my entire life, if I could pass something to future Aggies, and I tell this to young people when I talk to them, get ready, write this down, this is the pearl.

17:58.363 --> 18:02.650
I always worked to be the dumbest, laziest guy on the team.

18:02.917 --> 18:06.606
If anyone gets carried, I want it to be my big fat ass.

18:06.626 --> 18:10.135
I want smart folks around me because that's how you get things done.

18:10.616 --> 18:12.881
We put together a great bunch of people.

18:14.926 --> 18:20.520
I laid down, the only rules I laid down is get outside this existing paradigm.

18:20.973 --> 18:22.938
You know, forget about what's happened in the past.

18:22.958 --> 18:24.742
We're starting with a clean sheet of paper.

18:26.406 --> 18:31.297
What A&M is and the best parts of it, no matter what we say, you're not going to change that.

18:32.200 --> 18:34.385
And I am secure in the foundation.

18:35.006 --> 18:38.695
Where we stand today is because we're on the shoulders of giants.

18:38.675 --> 18:41.758
Now, let's talk about where we go next.

18:42.459 --> 18:43.080
And they did.

18:43.781 --> 18:45.182
And it was fun.

18:45.463 --> 18:48.166
Do you feel good about what A&M did?

18:48.206 --> 18:58.578
If you go look at our recommendations, which we got down, I got criticized by, Bum Bright said, you know, he said, this thing, I'm trying to paint everything maroon and white and make it all A&M.

18:59.258 --> 19:02.722
And I said, Bum, you know, he said, we didn't want you to do graphic design.

19:02.782 --> 19:05.205
You know, you're trying to drum up work for your company.

19:05.185 --> 19:07.529
I said, Mom, look, this is about politics.

19:08.010 --> 19:15.062
University of Texas, they project out to the people, they're everywhere and they're doing things for them.

19:15.323 --> 19:15.804
We don't.

19:15.864 --> 19:17.947
We're the best kept secret in the world.

19:17.967 --> 19:21.834
And we need to go say, this is all A&M and it's serving you.

19:21.934 --> 19:23.878
That's my message there.

19:23.898 --> 19:27.103
And that's why we got down to this detail and why we're doing it.

19:27.123 --> 19:30.349
But those ideas ran down.

19:30.329 --> 19:31.171
through there.

19:31.191 --> 19:39.066
A couple of them are mine, but most of them, you know, when you throw them out, you'd get the elevator and say, obviously you need to be doing that.

19:39.086 --> 19:40.429
I can't imagine that you're not.

19:40.489 --> 19:43.174
Do you mean you're not doing that?

19:43.542 --> 20:04.437
and four acre was a great ally he would just kind of lay in the weeds and and then when you know he had watched the ebb and flow and when we'd be in one of those tight battles and i had a lot of the former students who really didn't want to change much they had weighed in he was my calvary he and woody people like that so we hammered out and we worked through

20:04.417 --> 20:09.324
And every one of the recommendations that I wanted to get through, we got through, you can go read them.

20:09.724 --> 20:16.454
And if you remember, we finished that, what, in 78, 79, somewhere in there, whatever I found.

20:16.614 --> 20:19.698
You know, we worked on it two years, preliminary, then that, then direct.

20:20.279 --> 20:25.767
And then you go look at what we said then and what's accomplished now, and it's astounding.

20:26.152 --> 20:27.576
We didn't get to law school yet.

20:27.877 --> 20:31.248
And that was one of the most controversial things I put in there.

20:31.288 --> 20:32.592
That was my deal totally.

20:32.632 --> 20:34.137
Boy, that's the last thing.

20:34.157 --> 20:35.501
We need a bunch of damn lawyers.

20:35.541 --> 20:36.805
A&M's not about lawyers.

20:37.367 --> 20:39.975
But we need it, again, for political reasons.

20:41.035 --> 20:47.003
What other important actions are you proud to claim a part of?

20:47.965 --> 20:49.827
Well, just, you know, about everything.

20:49.848 --> 20:53.252
Serving on the board of the Association of Former Students was very rewarding.

20:53.332 --> 20:54.033
I enjoyed that.

20:54.514 --> 21:05.710
You know, we, the foundation traces its roots back to getting, but we're the ones that breathed life into the foundation, put money into the foundation, and really created the modern foundation.

21:05.690 --> 21:16.179
And you look at where it is today and from that standpoint back there, which again was I think in the 70s, I'm not even, you know, it all begins to get blurred.

21:16.199 --> 21:18.061
I have to go back and consult.

21:18.381 --> 21:24.626
You look at what that foundation has become and it's, I'm proud of that.

21:25.647 --> 21:34.735
And the other, my idea was this, that we make that and the university, Jarvis Miller wanted that to be a part of A&M.

21:35.440 --> 21:37.203
I'm pretty sure he was president then.

21:37.663 --> 21:39.486
It was him or some other ignoramus.

21:40.007 --> 21:42.250
Wanted it to be a part A&M, wanted to control it.

21:42.491 --> 21:43.973
I felt very strongly.

21:44.654 --> 21:46.557
And we had some people, well, you can't tell the president.

21:46.597 --> 21:47.799
I said, the hell I can.

21:47.819 --> 21:49.061
He works for us, you know.

21:50.242 --> 21:51.364
He has no jurisdiction.

21:51.404 --> 21:54.589
You know, if we're going to create it, we're going to fund it, make it independent.

21:54.849 --> 21:56.291
We're here to help the university.

21:56.772 --> 22:00.638
But if it's part of this university, the legislature will get their hands on it.

22:00.618 --> 22:03.461
or they'll cut appropriations, say, take it out of the foundation.

22:03.801 --> 22:10.588
If it's independent and it's out here, a standalone foundation, they can't get their hands on it, and neither can university.

22:10.608 --> 22:12.350
I said, how many presidents have you seen?

22:13.211 --> 22:16.194
You know, and during our lifetime, we'll see a hell of lots more.

22:16.214 --> 22:19.037
And I hope we have a lot of Jack Kenny Williams and a lot of Earl Rudders.

22:19.417 --> 22:23.802
I said, but you know, there could be a lot of bozos like whoever, and I'm pretty sure it's Jarvis.

22:24.583 --> 22:28.667
I used to call him President Bozo.

22:28.647 --> 22:32.231
You know, Haskell, we've had some numbnuts down there.

22:32.652 --> 22:36.396
This is a note to the typist to add as an editorial note.

22:36.416 --> 22:57.000
I've learned in recent months, as an example about keeping the foundation private, I've learned that when Mr. Sterling Evans first wanted to make a big gift of his estate,

22:57.993 --> 23:10.406
that he turned to John Lindsay for advice, and he told Mr. Lindsay that he wanted to make the gift to the Board of Regents officially, that they would decide what to do with it.

23:11.267 --> 23:23.680
And thank goodness Mr. Lindsay persuaded Mr. Evans not to give it to the Board, but to give it to the Foundation, and for Mr. Evans to clearly specify

23:24.166 --> 23:28.973
what intent he had with the gift and how it was to be used.

23:29.033 --> 23:29.855
Terribly important.

23:30.135 --> 23:30.816
Thank goodness.

23:30.876 --> 23:39.910
Lindsay and I have been unindicted co-conspirators and a whole bunch of those things like that because it's about understanding spheres of influence and balancing of powers.

23:39.950 --> 23:48.383
And if you study the Constitution of the United States and the separation and their checks and balance system, that's what we have trove to do at A&M.

23:48.403 --> 23:50.967
And I think it is the reason

23:50.947 --> 24:00.761
that when my time comes, I will die quietly and peacefully because I know some institutions that I believe in will exist that will continue to do those things.

24:01.402 --> 24:12.398
As you review all these years, can you think of any important errors A&M made or any sins of omission, things that could have done that didn't do?

24:13.255 --> 24:19.643
Well, they err on the side of being conservative, which I tend, you know, that's my basic nature.

24:19.663 --> 24:24.469
And for me to say someone is too conservative means that they've really got to be hide-pound.

24:24.489 --> 24:32.879
But A&Ms, and that's our great, it's like most people, their great strengths, their great weakness.

24:32.940 --> 24:36.264
My passion for things is a great strength.

24:36.344 --> 24:42.992
It's also a great weakness because if someone doesn't share that passion, you scare the hell out of them before you ever get a chance to engage with them.

24:43.428 --> 24:55.950
But A&M is, they remind me of the people that ride in the old nine passenger station wagons and they're in the seat facing backwards.

24:56.411 --> 25:05.487
They can tell you about everywhere they've been, but they're trying to tell the guy that's driving the thing up there where he's supposed to be going based on where they've been.

25:06.817 --> 25:20.797
I learned when I went off to Coast Guard OCS principle of navigation is, you know, you fix your present position, you look at your last position, and then you project off of that your course to achieve your next position.

25:21.158 --> 25:25.263
So I'm a big believer of looking back, knowing where you are to plot where you're going.

25:25.724 --> 25:27.807
But you can't just do it.

25:27.827 --> 25:30.230
You can't drive facing backwards.

25:30.371 --> 25:33.415
And if A&M has

25:33.395 --> 25:36.460
Something I would, I'd like to get more people looking out front.

25:36.520 --> 25:37.942
I think that's happened.

25:37.962 --> 25:46.416
And the younger ones now, I counsel some of them, you know, we ought to get rid of RC or we ought to, you know, they're a little, a little quick to change.

25:46.977 --> 25:48.739
It's maintaining balance.

25:50.442 --> 25:53.587
Of all the presidents, A&M president, I'm not going to ask you the negative.

25:53.948 --> 26:01.039
Of all the presidents you've observed at Texas A&M, to which ones would you give the highest marks?

26:01.508 --> 26:08.376
Well, Earl Rudder for his leadership and he, you know, it's like Nixon going to China.

26:08.637 --> 26:13.543
Earl Rudder is the only guy that could have said the Corps is optional and women are in.

26:13.663 --> 26:16.426
I mean, they would have lynched Jack Kenny Williams.

26:16.446 --> 26:23.034
But if you, so if you measure it in paradigm shift, fundamental change, the war goes to Rudder.

26:24.296 --> 26:29.642
The guy that followed him, Jack Kenny Williams, no one moved that, that,

26:30.128 --> 26:39.227
college to a university could have done it as well as Jack Kenny Williams who is just without peer and then

26:39.578 --> 26:54.661
for that bunch of bozos that the governor appointed, you know, to run him off has to rank as the, they are to identify and have a monument down of shame for all those regents that voted on that.

26:55.142 --> 27:00.531
And every student have, they go down there and they piss on their statue every year.

27:00.551 --> 27:02.093
That should be a new tradition.

27:02.073 --> 27:06.280
so that they're in the hall of shame at A&M.

27:06.700 --> 27:12.630
He came down to the medical center here in Houston and did for the medical center what he'd done for A&M.

27:13.090 --> 27:17.137
And never held any rancor, he accepted everything.

27:17.938 --> 27:21.203
I learned so much from that man and he is one of my great heroes.

27:21.544 --> 27:23.186
Certainly mine.

27:23.206 --> 27:27.473
But those two guys, and we have had

27:27.892 --> 27:39.971
Like I say, we've had Chancellor Bozos and President Bozos, and we've had some real Lulus down there in just my short tenure.

27:39.991 --> 27:40.872
Okay.

27:41.493 --> 27:53.832
If you could be a consultant to A&M's leadership, to A&M's leadership today, what advice would you give them about future direction of Texas A&M?

27:54.571 --> 28:00.717
Well, I would say read the reports that you have all these talented people come in and spend a lot of time doing.

28:00.950 --> 28:04.895
I mean, it's the reason that, one, you know they love A&M.

28:05.296 --> 28:08.660
Two, you know they're eminently qualified and you could not hire them.

28:09.521 --> 28:20.876
And three, they may make an occasional mistake of the head, but they're going to be none of the heart, and they're not motivated by anything but a sincere desire to see that university.

28:20.896 --> 28:22.978
So I would pay very close attention.

28:23.279 --> 28:29.607
There's a rebuttable presumption that every one of those recommendations should be vigorously implemented.

28:31.831 --> 28:40.062
All right, if you were to make a major gift to Texas A&M, for what purpose would you want that gift used?

28:41.204 --> 29:01.332
Well, I've thought about that because at some point, if fortune smiles on me and I'll cut that off, instead of giving the money to Texas A&M,

29:02.138 --> 29:07.189
A&M to decide or try to tell them, I will do it through a family foundation.

29:07.771 --> 29:19.236
And my three Aggies, who love that school and have just as many ties as I have because they're second generation now,

29:19.216 --> 29:38.828
and my grandchildren who are already arguing about where they go, they will decide and I want them to decide what A&M's needs are and not some faceless, nameless people that I don't know who may come along because I have served as a trustee on a lot of boards, Haskell.

29:38.808 --> 29:55.269
And some of them, I think, you who created all this, if you knew the kind of morons who were going to come in and some of the harebrained ideas that they have on how to spend your money, you'd be turning over in a grave.

29:55.869 --> 30:04.360
So I'm not saying that my family has the know-all, the end-all, but I do know something about their genes and what I've drilled into them.

30:04.340 --> 30:19.478
And I have more trust in their judgment of determining what A&M's needs are and hopefully using that money wisely than I do some folks up there.

30:19.498 --> 30:24.224
So most of my giving will go that way, and I will trust the next generation.

30:24.825 --> 30:26.967
All right, but let me be more specific.

30:27.368 --> 30:29.250
If you were deciding right now

30:30.007 --> 30:36.830
What purposes would you want your gift spent for if it were today?

30:38.355 --> 30:40.422
I would want to see more

30:42.308 --> 30:47.114
continuing education through the internet and outreach from A&M.

30:47.275 --> 30:52.822
A&M still today, for all of its strengths, does not reach out and touch average Texans.

30:53.623 --> 30:56.306
We are not a state-supported school.

30:56.326 --> 30:58.069
We're a state-assisted school.

30:58.489 --> 31:02.475
But the foundation is still public money and we're still a public institution.

31:02.495 --> 31:03.816
We're an asset of the people.

31:04.277 --> 31:08.923
And in my view, the greatest criticism I could make of A&M is we do not

31:08.903 --> 31:12.832
do the job we should in touching the lives of average Texans.

31:13.594 --> 31:21.453
There are people that pay taxes and have sacrificed, invested in that place that we have never served.

31:21.613 --> 31:25.883
And we need to, that is, our roots are...
