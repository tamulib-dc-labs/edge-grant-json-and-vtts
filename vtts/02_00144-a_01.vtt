One, two, three, four. One, two, three, four. One, 
two, three.

00:10.170 --> 00:11.343
Testing, testing. One, two, three, four. One, 
two, three. One, two, three, four. One, two,

00:16.000 --> 00:16.590
three. This is Tuesday, September the 5th. In the 
Blocker Building, I have the honor and pleasure of

00:24.180 --> 00:29.220
chatting with Dr. Janet McCann, Professor of 
English, about her years here at Texas A&M. And to

00:33.720 --> 00:38.360
introduce yourself to someone who might read this 
transcription or hear the tape many years in the

00:38.340 --> 00:41.100
future, describe, if you will, your background. 
Where did you grow up? What did parents do? Where

00:46.920 --> 00:49.140
did you go to high school and then college? 
Experience before coming to A&M. Okay. I grew up in

00:52.436 --> 00:54.340
Newark, Delaware. My mother was a language 
teacher and my father was a chemist. I went to the

00:59.630 --> 01:02.370
University of Delaware at first, and then I got 
thrown out. I was thrown out of the University of

01:03.950 --> 01:07.390
Delaware for producing an illegal newspaper. 
After that, I went to Otterbein College, and I

01:08.920 --> 01:16.000
graduated from there in 1963.

01:18.360 --> 01:22.540
And then I went on to the University of Pittsburgh 
for my graduate degree. I got the master's degree

01:22.680 --> 01:30.560
in 1964, and then I was married in 65. I had, though, 
by that time, completed my... coursework. And so I

01:37.594 --> 01:43.000
finished up my doctoral degree at the University 
of Pittsburgh to receive it in 1974, ten years

01:42.980 --> 01:45.860
later. But I came out here in 1968. How did you and 
A&M become connected? My husband took a job here in

01:54.080 --> 01:57.460
1968, and that's when the job market slammed shut. 
Before that, there were lots of jobs. And, in fact,

02:03.340 --> 02:05.520
with my master's degree, in 64, I was offered a 
whole bunch of jobs. But then all of a sudden,

02:10.460 --> 02:14.800
everything closed down. And Hugh looked for a job 
all over, and finally found a job at Texas A&M. So he

02:22.290 --> 02:24.790
came out here to start teaching in the fall of 1964. 
At that time, we had one daughter, Stephanie, and I

02:28.650 --> 02:32.090
was pregnant with the second child. Did you begin 
teaching that year? Yes, I did, but not at first. I

02:38.720 --> 02:39.741
came out in the fall. Lee Martin was then chair of 
the English department. And there was a professor

02:47.220 --> 02:50.360
who apparently had been behaving reprehensibly, 
and this person was booted out without ceremony.

02:54.930 --> 02:58.590
And then Lee Martin hired me to take his place in the 
middle of the second semester in 1969. In the

03:02.910 --> 03:05.530
spring of 1969, mid-semester, I was hired. So I 
took over class. I took over two classes, one

03:06.970 --> 03:09.190
Shakespeare class and two argumentation 
classes, and I was hired as an instructor then.

03:12.890 --> 03:16.270
This is the only time I will ask you about salary. 
What was the beginning salary in 1969? The

03:19.350 --> 03:23.010
beginning salary was $8,000 a year. However, we 
didn't get raises, and I got that $8,000 a year for

03:27.410 --> 03:28.531
many years after that. So there really wasn't a 
search process or a search committee or anything?

03:33.990 --> 03:35.011
No, there certainly wasn't. In fact, I was hired. I 
was hired. I was hired. I had sent in when I came out

03:37.410 --> 03:40.050
here and looked around. Actually, I kind of 
suffered from culture shock because we'd just

03:42.010 --> 03:44.070
come from the University of Chicago, and this 
place was very different from the rest of the world

03:44.190 --> 03:46.710
then. For one thing, in the rest of the world, not 
everybody had pickups with gun racks in them. This

03:51.630 --> 03:54.930
was something that struck my eye when I got off the 
bus because I came out on a bus. For another, they

03:57.230 --> 04:00.250
then had in the Eagle, which was then the Bryan 
Eagle, they had a weekend, every weekend they had a

04:02.710 --> 04:06.510
violent death toll, which included stabbings and 
shootings and drownings as well as car crashes. So

04:13.110 --> 04:16.350
I came here, and I thought I was on Mars. I didn't 
like the activities for women because we were kind

04:19.270 --> 04:22.370
of supposed to be faculty wives, and this is not 
what I thought I'd trained for. And so I was bored,

04:25.430 --> 04:30.330
and I sent a resume with my newly minted master's on 
it to the head of the English department. Of

04:36.210 --> 04:37.731
course, I didn't get any response. And I was 
complaining to Manuel Davenport at a rather

04:40.870 --> 04:44.670
well-oiled party about how crummy things were and 
how I wanted something to do, and he said, go in and

04:48.470 --> 04:51.110
introduce yourself to the department chair. And 
so I did this. I was very uneasy about this kind of

04:53.680 --> 04:56.320
thing, but I went in, I said, hello, I'm Janet 
McCann, I'd like a job. He said, well, I'll see what

04:59.380 --> 05:02.160
I can do for you next year. And this was... This was 
in the beginning of the spring, and who was the

05:06.680 --> 05:08.141
department chair? Lee Martin. This was Lee, your 
company. Oh, and he said, see what he could do for me

05:10.640 --> 05:13.720
in the fall. He said he might have a class or two that 
nobody wanted. Well, about a month later, he

05:16.540 --> 05:20.040
called me up and said, can you start teaching 
Monday? So that was my beginning. And this was to

05:26.350 --> 05:28.610
replace the faculty member? Who had been given the 
royal title, yes. Would it be appropriate on this

05:32.090 --> 05:37.210
to discuss his alleged shortcomings?

05:41.930 --> 05:42.941
Probably not. They were fairly spectacular.

05:50.510 --> 05:55.890
Okay, so I was hired to fill in for someone who had 
been fired, and I was not told any of the background

05:56.050 --> 05:59.930
of the situation. And this was about what point in 
the semester? This was in the middle of the

06:02.330 --> 06:03.811
semester. So I had a bunch of students. I got a grade 
book with a bunch of grades, and these students

06:08.830 --> 06:11.690
seemed extremely disorderly and rude. And I had 
not got the impression that Aggies were lying. I

06:16.430 --> 06:21.930
didn't know anything like that, but due to 
apparently the strained relationships with the

06:21.910 --> 06:26.090
previous instructor, about which I was told 
nothing, I had a bunch of loony students all

06:26.670 --> 06:30.490
semester. They said and did strange things in 
class. They'd showed up when they felt like it and

06:33.330 --> 06:38.800
left when they felt like it. I was going to not teach 
here anymore. I was going to look for something

06:44.020 --> 06:46.240
somewhere else. but somebody confided in me that 
the previous instructor had set up bad

06:51.390 --> 06:53.370
relationships with the students and therefore I 
should give it another chance and take another

06:55.150 --> 06:57.870
semester if offered, so I did. And, of course, they 
were completely different the second time. All

06:59.810 --> 07:03.210
right, now those first classes you taught were 
what level courses? I had a Shakespeare course,

07:03.790 --> 07:08.010
which was an interesting upper-level 
Shakespeare course. Well, it's not upper-level,

07:08.150 --> 07:09.641
really. It's 212. Back then there were very few 
courses, and this is one thing that makes it very

07:12.850 --> 07:17.690
different from now. There was no real hierarchy 
within the department. That is, everybody taught

07:22.050 --> 07:24.570
the same thing. There was not a lot of fighting for 
classes. There were very few graduate classes,

07:28.480 --> 07:32.520
and the graduate program was new. The graduate 
classes were taught by the same people every time,

07:35.780 --> 07:37.121
so there was no fighting for those. And otherwise 
everybody taught the same survey classes,

07:43.250 --> 07:44.950
world-lit, American-lit, British-lit. There 
was Shakespeare. I think there was Chaucer. I

07:48.550 --> 07:49.951
didn't ever teach that. There were classes in 
argumentation and freshman composition.

07:57.270 --> 08:00.050
But we all took our turn teaching them, and I 
believe it was the head's position that everybody

08:03.250 --> 08:05.850
should have a class of freshman English a year, so 
we all did. The department was located? The

08:09.110 --> 08:11.830
department was in the academic building. 
Describe it. Describe it physically, about how

08:13.987 --> 08:16.830
many people and who were the key, who were the 
senior folks. Okay, the senior, there was John

08:18.410 --> 08:21.950
Paul Abbott and Carol Laverty. There was Harrison 
Hurth. There were Sid Cox and, oh, gosh,

08:26.430 --> 08:34.040
scheduling fellow. Curtis Shoddy, who's still 
around.

08:39.940 --> 08:41.381
Frank Pierce was there. And I'm trying to think of 
others. There was somebody named John Gwynn.

08:48.170 --> 08:49.119
There was E.E. Stokes. There was a woman, one woman 
named Muriel Seville, and she was only there

08:54.870 --> 08:56.530
briefly, and she was the only woman who was a 
regular faculty member. So one full-time female.

09:02.970 --> 09:06.030
One full-time female, if you don't count 
students. There were a couple of students who were

09:06.490 --> 09:08.790
teaching, a couple of women students who were 
teaching full-time, but they were students. And

09:14.530 --> 09:17.990
the normal workload then for a full-time faculty 
member, in English, was how many sections per

09:18.030 --> 09:20.290
semester? That's hard to answer because I always 
had nine hours. But one of the classes was always

09:26.910 --> 09:29.330
large, and they would count that as two classes. So 
it was a theoretical 12-hour load, and some people

09:32.970 --> 09:34.690
did have 12-hour loads. If you taught speech, for 
instance, you always had a 12-hour load. But since

09:39.650 --> 09:42.770
they would count a class of 100, which I frequently 
had, as two classes, I always had a nine-hour load.

09:47.910 --> 09:50.670
Now, the introductory survey courses had about 
how many students, the freshman English courses?

09:54.350 --> 09:55.831
Oh, the freshman English courses, they had, as 
now, a limit of 25, but they were often smaller.

10:04.210 --> 10:07.630
Often you'd have 17 or 18 students in there. Now, of 
course, they're always jammed. As you were being

10:09.310 --> 10:14.030
introduced into the department, describe how the 
department received you. How did it work? How did

10:18.190 --> 10:21.780
they accept you or not accept you? They didn't 
quite know what to do with me. I was an instructor

10:24.320 --> 10:27.100
with a master's degree. Ph.D.s were not required 
for tenure-track work then, and in fact, some of

10:31.120 --> 10:33.400
the people, Steve Jernigan was there, too, and 
Steve and Sid and several others, Frank, for that

10:38.380 --> 10:41.640
matter, did not have Ph.D.s. So that wasn't a 
problem. I was the youngest person in the

10:43.080 --> 10:46.100
department. That was kind of a problem. I kind of 
fell between the graduate, in their minds, I kind

10:52.210 --> 10:54.090
of fell between the graduate students and the 
professors. The graduate students were a very

10:56.270 --> 11:00.050
motley bunch then. I

11:00.030 --> 11:08.840
was not, I think I was just kind of accepted

11:08.820 --> 11:10.660
by the younger people in the faculty who were still 
considerably older than I and overlooked

11:13.980 --> 11:16.500
entirely by the older people. Some of them, Carol 
Laverty, for instance, persisted in thinking I

11:18.440 --> 11:21.960
was a graduate student. And the other people in the 
building didn't consider me, that is, people

11:28.690 --> 11:30.171
outside the English department. I was constantly 
challenged on my right to use the elevator. People

11:35.440 --> 11:39.640
would say, what department are you in? And 
sometimes I got a little bit irritated with this.

11:44.820 --> 11:48.480
And the graduate program was a master's degree 
only at that point? No, it wasn't. It was a Ph.D.

11:49.460 --> 11:50.481
program. But Ph.D. was already authorized. Yes, 
and I think that they graduated the first one about

11:54.220 --> 11:55.181
the year before. It was either the year I came or the 
year I came. In terms of scholarship and

11:57.600 --> 12:00.080
reputation, who were the people best known in the 
department? Well, no one had published anything.

12:05.900 --> 12:09.460
I mean, Frank Pierce wrote Mystery Stories. He was 
one of the best published. Herth and two of the

12:11.920 --> 12:18.960
others, I think Laverty and somebody else, had 
written a textbook

12:18.940 --> 12:25.530
that was used in the basic literature class, the 
203. and Lee Martin had written a textbook called

12:25.510 --> 12:30.970
the 500 word theme which Harry Kreuter then 
revised and that was about it scholarship wasn't

12:30.950 --> 12:39.020
the dumb thing did you find anyone that you could 
turn to for advice in the department who became a

12:44.740 --> 12:51.530
friend Stanley Archer describe him Stanley 
Archer was always very reserved but extremely

12:51.510 --> 12:58.160
helpful and I always in fact until he died I always 
went to Stanley Archer when I had some kind of

12:58.140 --> 13:07.160
naughty question example any of his advice his 
counsel well

13:07.140 --> 13:22.050
several times that I had felt that I had been not 
treated right by the department or the University

13:22.030 --> 13:27.810
and I went to Stanley Archer before doing anything 
about it and Stanley Archer agreed that I had been

13:29.350 --> 13:34.630
not treated right and he he looked over letters 
that I wrote concerning this that went to various

13:34.610 --> 13:39.730
people and made suggestions on the letters that 
were very useful now in describe the the students

13:42.710 --> 13:50.240
your first years here ok leaving aside the bunch of 
loons I had the first semester they were for the

13:55.960 --> 13:57.221
most part male in fact in my first class that these 
are the ones I took over I had only two women in the

14:00.220 --> 14:06.680
three classes for the next four or five years I had 
by far I

14:06.660 --> 14:16.240
would say oh maybe three to one at least men versus 
women they were all for the most part they were all

14:16.220 --> 14:25.200
white they were all the uniforms were by far 
greater presence you looked out in the class and

14:25.180 --> 14:29.620
you saw mostly uniforms

14:29.600 --> 14:40.740
they were very they called me ma'am they were very 
obedient again leaving out this first lot however

14:40.720 --> 14:46.620
they had no intellectual many of them had no 
intellectual curiosity and English was

14:46.600 --> 14:50.280
something they had to get through on their way to 
some to something else sometimes they would

14:50.260 --> 14:54.360
develop I always liked teaching Shakespeare 
although I have no training in it because they had a

14:57.100 --> 15:02.200
tendency to bond with Shakespeare and actually 
take an interest in in what they were doing but as

15:02.180 --> 15:08.120
far as learning methods and materials of research 
they were not into this the

15:08.100 --> 15:18.630
activities with those first students can you 
share any anecdotes of what it was like with their

15:18.610 --> 15:24.870
excuses are there did any of them ever try to put one 
over on you oh many times okay one I had it this was a

15:24.850 --> 15:31.650
member of the Corps of Cadets and he was he was 
missing for about two-thirds of the semester and

15:36.360 --> 15:40.400
then he reappeared with this letter assigned Dr. 
Anderson urologist with a complicated and

15:46.380 --> 15:50.140
detailed description of what was supposedly 
wrong with this young man's urinary system that

15:50.120 --> 15:57.880
had caused him to miss my class and it was 
supposedly signed by his father too and by the by

15:57.860 --> 16:04.580
Dr. Anderson and I read the thing and it sounded a 
little funny I didn't think the doctor would be

16:06.800 --> 16:11.380
quite so free with details in fact it sounded a 
little bit like it had been even taken from

16:11.360 --> 16:18.560
somewhere so I didn't he was supposed to come 
around Monday I was supposed to I went to a party on

16:18.540 --> 16:23.000
Friday on Friday evening and there was Dr. 
Anderson so I asked about this letter and he said

16:22.980 --> 16:28.530
that this the student had been to his office for 
some sort of minor problem at the beginning of the

16:32.470 --> 16:36.750
semester but he had never written any letter for 
him this guy pinched the the stationery and so I he

16:36.730 --> 16:43.410
showed up on Monday and I said Mr. Smith that's a 
pseudonym would you like to hear what Dr. Anderson

16:43.390 --> 16:48.690
said about your letter and he said no ma'am I don't 
think I would and I never saw him again my

16:48.670 --> 16:55.550
favorite is youngster who told me the first day of 
the semester that his grandfather was very ill I

17:01.230 --> 17:06.410
expressed my concern my sadness I hope it's not 
serious oh very serious oh gee gee he said in fact he

17:08.610 --> 17:14.010
may not survive this semester I said well I'll work 
with you and we'll do the best we can as he walked out

17:13.990 --> 17:17.690
the door he turned over his shoulder and he said 
it's in fact it's almost certain he's gonna die the

17:17.670 --> 17:20.810
first day of deer season and he grinned as he walked 
away what about classroom behavior patterns how

17:29.790 --> 17:37.970
did Aggies behave in class in the in those early 
years I don't think they did it politely for the

17:38.640 --> 17:46.450
most part of that they they tended to calculate 
what they needed to do to get through the course and

17:46.430 --> 17:51.590
do that much and they were always polite back then 
there was such a thing as a gentleman see that

18:00.990 --> 18:07.470
many of them were quite content to receive I never 
had any trouble with students in those first years

18:07.450 --> 18:10.630
at all except for again leaving aside this first 
lot Gciendo and large core percentage in those

18:10.770 --> 18:20.240
years yes uh-huh in general were these country 
boys or city there were country boys for the most

18:20.220 --> 18:32.030
part and

18:20.220 --> 18:32.030
very few liberal arts majors yes q liberal arts 
majors and the those who were I tended not to get

18:38.430 --> 18:41.910
because I tended to teach basic classes on the 
other hand there weren't that many specialized

18:41.890 --> 18:46.130
classes for instance I'm in creative writing and 
that's what I do now I coordinate the creative

18:46.110 --> 18:50.690
writing classes there was no creative writing 
then after years and years Frank Pierce I think

18:50.670 --> 18:55.670
started creative writing and Dick Costa taught 
creative writing and there was one class a year and

19:02.010 --> 19:07.820
you were lucky to get your 10 students that you 
needed to have that class make now of course we have

19:07.800 --> 19:17.660
we can't offer enough we especially our 200 level 
courses we always get we're offering four

19:17.640 --> 19:21.800
sections this time and I had dozens and dozens of 
requests to be forced in but you can't it's it's 225

19:27.480 --> 19:32.540
students to teach creative writing that's enough 
students you can't do any more than that teach them

19:32.520 --> 19:37.940
describe registration in that era those early 
years as I recall there were long tables there were

19:37.920 --> 19:44.670
there was a room somewhere maybe in Heaton I don't 
remember where it was right now Sabisa and G

19:49.370 --> 19:55.090
Raleigh or had we already moved out of that where 
you where faculty used to go on registration day

19:55.070 --> 19:59.650
the students went through there I don't remember 
whether whether I just remember sitting at these

19:59.630 --> 20:03.550
tables and having people come in I would be 
representing like Shakespeare and people would

20:03.530 --> 20:07.370
sign up I I , I

20:09.250 --> 20:15.650
don't remember when that stopped and I don't 
remember where it was but I certainly remember

20:15.630 --> 20:16.791
doing it. Those in those early years did you have 
the normal rules in your syllabus did you have any

20:25.030 --> 20:30.170
guidelines that you gave to the students what you 
expected. No some people did I mean I had a syllabus

20:30.150 --> 20:38.910
if you mean assignments and so forth yes I had a 
syllabus with the assignments on it and the

20:38.890 --> 20:42.630
textbook that and usually it was one page and that 
was it. Did you check roll in those years? Every

20:48.610 --> 20:50.630
day, no, I didn't. Basically, though, after the 
first two weeks at least, I knew who everybody was

20:55.610 --> 20:59.630
in the smaller classes. In the bigger classes, I 
always left it up to them if they wanted to come to

21:02.610 --> 21:05.630
class, and I think this is one of the reasons that I 
never had any trouble with students during that

21:05.610 --> 21:09.630
time period because I didn't make them come to 
class. If they missed a quiz, they could not make it

21:11.610 --> 21:15.690
up. The assignment dates, though, including the 
quizzes, were on the sheet, so anyone

21:22.110 --> 21:32.120
who could do

21:22.110 --> 21:32.120
satisfactory work without attending the 
lectures, maybe by reading the textbook and the

21:32.100 --> 21:37.120
other materials, that was all right with me. And 
you were a pioneer female faculty member. Did

21:41.100 --> 21:44.120
women students turn to you occasionally for any 
advice? Actually, the

21:45.100 --> 21:54.390
students who came to me for advice and counsel back 
then were mostly men, young men. I think

21:57.370 --> 22:03.140
they saw me as Mama. As far as the young women were 
concerned, I don't know where they went, but they

22:07.200 --> 22:11.340
didn't come to me. And what was the normal title 
that the students gave you when they spoke to you?

22:19.130 --> 22:22.530
They tended to call me Mrs. McCann. Of course, I did 
not have a Ph.D. I did not have a Ph.D. then, so I

22:24.510 --> 22:28.740
would not have been Dr. McCann. But they tended to 
call me Mrs. McCann. And they were polite. And they

22:31.720 --> 22:33.740
were polite. Mrs. McCann, ma'am. Let's back up a 
little and describe how it was to get settled into

22:35.720 --> 22:43.800
this community. You all found a place to live and 
children and so forth. Yes. Now,

22:47.222 --> 22:54.100
Hugh came out a couple of weeks after he was hired. 
He came out and stayed with Manuel Davenport for

22:54.080 --> 23:01.450
three or four days and bought a house. And the house 
cost $19,000. It was on Carter Creek Parkway. And

23:09.090 --> 23:11.110
it was a nice little brick house. It had three 
bedrooms in a very pleasant area.

23:21.160 --> 23:24.180
So we didn't have any trouble with that. And the 
children were not yet school age? No, they were

23:26.160 --> 23:27.181
not. And we took them to French's Royal Tot, which 
actually worked out very well for my daughter. I

23:33.160 --> 23:36.180
think it was not the right place for my son. But I 
didn't know that then. It seemed fine. Do you

23:39.160 --> 23:42.180
remember what that daycare cost then? Yeah. It 
cost $65 a month for one. And I think $95. That's

23:50.240 --> 23:51.261
quite good. Yeah. I reduced right over to it. And 
your neighbors, how were they? How were they in

23:57.240 --> 24:01.260
being receptive to a newcomer? Well, I didn't like 
the neighbors, frankly. I thought them bigots.

24:09.510 --> 24:15.940
For one thing, we had a maid, as everybody did then. 
And they were very upset because I let the maid

24:15.920 --> 24:22.310
bring her little girl to play with my little girl. 
And this caused all kinds of problems. So I didn't

24:24.600 --> 24:27.620
get on very well with the neighbors. I did also, 
before I worked in the fall, I did go to some of their

24:27.600 --> 24:34.940
little cafe clutches. And I hated them. That is, 
not the neighbors, but those morning coffees

24:36.920 --> 24:44.940
where people would discuss their families and 
their lives. And to me, it seemed extremely

24:44.920 --> 24:49.500
limited and sterile. And this led to my being very 
anxious to get out of there and talk to Emanuel

24:49.480 --> 24:57.500
Davenport about the possibility of escape. But, 
no, the neighbors were not neighbors I would have

24:57.480 --> 25:01.500
chosen. They were not affiliated with the 
university. They worked in a factory. And now I

25:09.040 --> 25:12.060
can't think where or which. Was it a shoe factory? 
It could have been a shoe factory. Ms. Carson? I

25:17.988 --> 25:22.910
don't remember, but I do remember that neighbors 
on both sides worked in a factory and were friends.

25:22.890 --> 25:27.940
And the neighbor behind us, I liked him somewhat 
better. He was military.

25:32.210 --> 25:37.230
Across the street from us was Dr. Caperton, the 
skin person. And they held themselves aloof, the

25:37.210 --> 25:41.800
Capertons. They had a bigger house and they kind of 
didn't socialize too much with the rest of us. In

25:47.780 --> 25:52.340
fact, there was a whole little enclave of bigger 
houses across the street. But

25:52.320 --> 25:58.260
once I got out of the neighborhood, it was pleasant 
enough. I mean, it was certainly a nice place to

25:58.240 --> 26:00.260
live. They were... The neighbors were decent 
people. They were just very narrow-minded. What

26:05.240 --> 26:07.260
about shopping? There was nothing much. There was 
the Townshire Shopping Center and that was it.

26:12.240 --> 26:15.700
There was, I believe, a Sears there. There was a 
pharmacy with a

26:15.680 --> 26:28.190
little diner in it where they used to have in 
pharmacies. And I used to... We only had one car.

26:30.170 --> 26:35.570
So, actually, the semester I spent home alone, was 
not fun. Because I didn't have the car either and I

26:37.550 --> 26:40.570
had the little girl. But what I would do would be to 
wheel her to the Townshire Shopping Center. And

26:44.670 --> 26:52.690
there we would have, like, ice cream sundaes at the 
little diner inside it. And go to Sears, maybe. But

26:56.720 --> 26:58.740
there was not much. There was a Kroger's. That was. 
Now we're... Hastings. Hastings, you know,

27:06.009 --> 27:09.450
Manner East. And there was the Townshire Shopping 
Center. And there was Downtown College Station.

27:14.430 --> 27:15.451
And one thing... I mean, Downtown Bryan. I'm 
sorry. There was nothing Downtown College

27:17.375 --> 27:23.450
Station except for a couple of shoe places and 
barber shops. And all the student bars. One thing I

27:25.430 --> 27:29.450
noticed, though, was that back then when you came 
into town, all the local merchants gave you these

27:29.430 --> 27:32.450
credit cards. They called you up. And they gave you 
credit cards that were good for their own stores.

27:38.430 --> 27:40.162
Beverly Braley. I understand something terrible 
happened to him. He just retired. And then he was

27:44.640 --> 27:46.660
killed in an accident. It probably wasn't an 
accident. Yeah. Don't put that in the... I forgot

27:52.530 --> 27:56.020
about that machine. Let's see. Did you become 
involved in any community activities? Not right

28:02.090 --> 28:04.110
away. After I started working, I did. Because I 
must say that I had a lot more leisure as an

28:06.090 --> 28:12.110
instructor and then later as a lecturer even than I 
have now. Now, any spare time is immediately

28:16.090 --> 28:19.110
filled in. Back then, I just taught my classes and 
went home. So I was a Girl Scout leader. I worked at

28:23.090 --> 28:26.110
the Bryan City Mission. I worked for the Brazos 
Valley Literacy Council. I did all these things.

28:31.090 --> 28:31.763
Church? Synagogue? Did you attend? Oh, yeah. 
Catholic. We went to church. Which... Describe

28:37.576 --> 28:40.110
the parish y'all attended. Back then, we 
attended... Let's see. We attended St. Mary's.

28:46.240 --> 28:49.260
And it was not that different from the way it is now. 
I mean, it was full of Aggies.

28:53.870 --> 28:57.630
Yeah,

28:53.870 --> 28:57.630
that was it. St. Mary's was our parish for years and 
years. And then they built St. Thomas. We sort of

29:02.610 --> 29:04.630
moved over there, but what frequently happens is 
that my husband goes to St. Thomas Aquinas and I

29:09.610 --> 29:10.631
still go to St. Mary's because, A, I don't like to 
get up to go to the 830 Mass, and, B, I like going to

29:13.610 --> 29:16.630
St. Mary's. This man, Manuel Davenport, since I 
won't be able to interview him, tell me as much as

29:20.610 --> 29:22.630
you can. How did you all come to know him in the first 
place? Okay. And then describe him as much as you

29:25.502 --> 29:27.630
can because we need to be sure to include him in this 
reservoir. Yeah. He, first of all, invited Hugh to

29:32.115 --> 29:35.630
stay with him and look for a house and then helped 
Hugh find a house. But how did they even... He hired

29:40.610 --> 29:42.940
Hugh. Oh. There was a search and he hired Hugh. Oh, 
in philosophy? Yeah. Oh, I'm sorry. Yeah. No, no

29:49.247 --> 29:50.940
problem. But there was a search in philosophy and 
they hired Hugh. And then they invited him to come

29:53.920 --> 29:57.940
out and stay with them and find accommodations. So 
he did that. And I was, at this time, pregnant. And I

30:02.920 --> 30:04.940
told him that I wanted a house. I said I wanted to 
start with a house. So, although we didn't have

30:06.920 --> 30:07.941
very much money, with my parents' help, it was 
possible to buy this house. And back then, too, it

30:13.920 --> 30:16.940
was much easier to get a bank loan. There wasn't 
much of a check. You know, you were an A&M

30:18.920 --> 30:20.940
professor. You could have the loan. So we got this 
house on Carter Creek Parkway. But the Davenports

30:24.920 --> 30:27.940
were very nice to Hugh. And I can't imagine that 
happening now, that you hire somebody and the head

30:30.920 --> 30:34.940
invites this person to stay with them for three or 
four days and helps them find a house. So then we

30:40.620 --> 30:43.590
came out. And I liked the philosophy department 
immediately. It was about how many? I would say

30:50.200 --> 30:53.820
about six. There was Ed Harris and Davenport and 
Stadelman and Becca. Who am I missing?

31:09.090 --> 31:11.110
I don't think there was anybody else besides Hugh. 
Those are the people I remember from parties. That

31:13.090 --> 31:16.110
is, as permanent members.
