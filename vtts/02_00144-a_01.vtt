One, two, three, four. One, two, three, four. One, 
two, three.

00:10.170 --> 00:11.343
Testing, testing. One, two, three, four. One, 
two, three. One, two, three, four. One, two,

00:16.000 --> 00:16.590
three. This is Tuesday, September the 5th. In the 
Blocker Building, I have the honor and pleasure of

00:24.180 --> 00:29.220
chatting with Dr. Janet McCann, Professor of 
English, about her years here at Texas A&M. And to

00:33.720 --> 00:38.360
introduce yourself to someone who might read this 
transcription or hear the tape many years in the

00:38.340 --> 00:41.100
future, describe, if you will, your background. 
Where did you grow up? What did parents do? Where

00:46.920 --> 00:49.140
did you go to high school and then college? 
Experience before coming to A&M. Okay. I grew up in

00:52.436 --> 00:54.340
Newark, Delaware. My mother was a language 
teacher and my father was a chemist. I went to the

00:59.630 --> 01:02.370
University of Delaware at first, and then I got 
thrown out. I was thrown out of the University of

01:03.950 --> 01:07.390
Delaware for producing an illegal newspaper. 
After that, I went to Otterbein College, and I

01:08.920 --> 01:16.000
graduated from there in 1963.

01:18.360 --> 01:22.540
And then I went on to the University of Pittsburgh 
for my graduate degree. I got the master's degree

01:22.680 --> 01:30.560
in 1964, and then I was married in 65. I had, though, 
by that time, completed my... coursework. And so I

01:37.594 --> 01:43.000
finished up my doctoral degree at the University 
of Pittsburgh to receive it in 1974, ten years

01:42.980 --> 01:45.860
later. But I came out here in 1968. How did you and 
A&M become connected? My husband took a job here in

01:54.080 --> 01:57.460
1968, and that's when the job market slammed shut. 
Before that, there were lots of jobs. And, in fact,

02:03.340 --> 02:05.520
with my master's degree, in 64, I was offered a 
whole bunch of jobs. But then all of a sudden,

02:10.480 --> 02:14.820
everything closed down. And Hugh looked for a job 
all over, and finally found a job at Texas A&M. So he

02:22.350 --> 02:24.790
came out here to start teaching in the fall of 1964. 
At that time, we had one daughter, Stephanie, and I

02:28.650 --> 02:32.070
was pregnant with the second child. Did you begin 
teaching that year? Yes, I did, but not at first. I

02:38.720 --> 02:39.741
came out in the fall. Lee Martin was then chair of 
the English department. And there was a professor

02:47.200 --> 02:50.360
who apparently had been behaving reprehensibly, 
and this person was booted out without ceremony.

02:54.930 --> 02:58.590
And then Lee Martin hired me to take his place in the 
middle of the second semester in 1969. In the

03:02.910 --> 03:05.530
spring of 1969, mid-semester, I was hired. So I 
took over class. I took two classes, one

03:07.270 --> 03:09.290
Shakespeare class and two argumentation 
classes, and I was hired as an instructor then.

03:13.270 --> 03:16.290
This is the only time I will ask you about salary. 
What was the beginning salary in 1969? The

03:19.270 --> 03:23.290
beginning salary was $8,000 a year. However, we 
didn't get raises, and I got that $8,000 a year for

03:25.270 --> 03:29.290
many years after that. So there really wasn't a 
search process or a search committee or anything?

03:34.270 --> 03:35.291
No, there certainly wasn't. In fact, I had sent in 
when I came out here and looked around. Actually, I

03:40.110 --> 03:42.230
kind of suffered from culture shock because we'd 
just come from the University of Chicago, and this

03:44.210 --> 03:47.330
place was very different from the rest of the world 
then. For one thing, in the rest of the world, not

03:49.310 --> 03:51.630
everybody had pickups with gun racks in them. This 
was something that struck my eye when I got off the

03:51.610 --> 03:54.930
bus because I came out on a bus. For another, they 
then had in the Eagle, which was then the Bryan

04:00.410 --> 04:02.630
Eagle, they had a weekend. Every weekend, they had 
a violent death toll, which included stabbings

04:06.810 --> 04:11.330
and shootings and drownings as well as car 
crashes. So I came here, and I thought I was on Mars.

04:16.310 --> 04:19.330
I didn't like the activities for women because we 
were kind of supposed to be faculty wives, and this

04:22.310 --> 04:25.330
is not what I thought I'd trained for. And so I was 
bored, and I sent a resume with my newly minted

04:30.330 --> 04:33.350
master's on it to the head of the English 
department. Of course, I didn't get any response.

04:38.330 --> 04:42.350
And I was complaining to Manuel Davenport at a 
rather well-oiled party about how crummy things

04:45.450 --> 04:48.470
were and how I wanted something to do, and he said, 
go in and introduce yourself to the department

04:48.450 --> 04:51.470
chair. And so I did this. I was very uneasy about 
this kind of thing, but I went in and I said, hello,

04:56.300 --> 04:58.820
I'm Janet McKenna. I'd like a job. He said, well, 
I'll see what I can do for you next year. And this

05:02.800 --> 05:04.820
was... This was in the beginning. The beginning of 
this spring. And who was the department? Lee

05:08.800 --> 05:09.331
Martin. This was Lee, your company. Oh, and he 
said, see what he could do for me in the fall. He said

05:13.800 --> 05:16.820
he might have a class or two that nobody wanted. 
Well, about a month later, he called me up and said,

05:20.300 --> 05:22.850
can you start teaching Monday? So that was my 
beginning. And this was to replace the faculty

05:26.830 --> 05:28.850
member? Who had been given the royal title, yes. 
Would it be appropriate on this to discuss his

05:35.330 --> 05:36.851
alleged shortcomings? Probably

05:36.830 --> 05:42.958
not. They were fairly spectacular. Okay,

05:45.490 --> 05:52.370
so I was hired to fill in for someone who had been 
fired, and I was not told any of the background of

05:56.350 --> 05:59.370
the situation. And this was about what point in the 
semester? This was in the middle of the semester.

06:03.350 --> 06:05.370
So I had a bunch of students. I got a grade book with a 
bunch of grades. And these students seemed

06:08.350 --> 06:11.370
extremely disorderly and rude. And I had not got 
the impression that Aggie Smith was like that. But

06:16.910 --> 06:20.930
due to apparently the strained relationships 
with the previous instructor, about which I was

06:20.910 --> 06:24.930
told nothing, I had a bunch of loony students all 
semester. They said and did strange things in

06:28.910 --> 06:31.930
class. They showed up when they felt like it and 
left when they felt like it. I was going to not teach

06:38.380 --> 06:42.400
here anymore. I was going to look for something 
somewhere else. But

06:44.380 --> 06:51.490
somebody confided in me that the previous 
instructor had set up bad relationships with the

06:51.470 --> 06:53.490
students and therefore I should give it another 
chance and take another semester if offered. So I

06:57.470 --> 06:58.491
did. And of course they were completely different 
the second time. All right, now those first

07:00.470 --> 07:02.490
classes you taught were what level courses? I had a 
Shakespeare course, which was interesting,

07:06.470 --> 07:08.490
upper level Shakespeare course. Well, it's not 
upper level really, it's 212. Back then there were

07:11.470 --> 07:13.490
very few courses. And this is one thing that makes 
it very different from now. There was no real

07:17.470 --> 07:21.490
hierarchy within the department. That is, 
everybody taught the same thing. There was not a

07:25.560 --> 07:28.580
lot of fighting for classes. There were very few 
graduate classes, and the graduate program was

07:30.560 --> 07:32.580
new. The graduate classes were taught by the same 
people every time, so there was no fighting for

07:35.560 --> 07:37.580
those. And otherwise everybody taught the same 
survey classes, world lit, American lit, British

07:42.870 --> 07:44.890
lit. There was Shakespeare. I think there was 
Chaucer. I didn't ever teach that. There were

07:50.870 --> 07:57.510
classes in argumentation and freshman 
composition.

07:57.490 --> 08:00.510
But we all took our turn teaching them, and I 
believe it was the head's position that everybody

08:03.490 --> 08:05.510
should have a class of freshman English a year, so 
we all did. And the department was located? The

08:09.490 --> 08:12.510
department was in the academic building. Can you 
describe it physically, about how many people and

08:15.490 --> 08:17.510
who were the key, who were the senior folks? Okay, 
the senior, there was John Paul Abbott and Carol

08:18.490 --> 08:23.540
Laverty. There was Harrison Hurst. There were Sid 
Cox and, oh gosh, scheduling fellow, Curtis

08:35.300 --> 08:39.440
Shoddy, who's still around. Frank Pierce was 
there.

08:44.740 --> 08:45.761
And I'm trying to think of others. There was 
somebody named John Gwynn. There was E.E. Stokes.

08:52.650 --> 08:55.670
There was a woman, one woman named Muriel Savelle, 
and she was only there briefly, and she was the only

08:57.650 --> 09:00.670
woman who was a regular faculty member. So one 
full-time female. One full-time female if you

09:03.650 --> 09:07.670
don't count students. There were a couple of 
students who were teaching, a couple of women

09:10.650 --> 09:13.670
students who were teaching full-time, but they 
were students. And I'm trying to think of a

09:15.650 --> 09:18.670
workload then for a full-time faculty member in 
English with how many sections per semester.

09:22.650 --> 09:28.210
That's hard to answer because I always had nine 
hours. But one of the classes was always large, and

09:31.190 --> 09:33.210
they would count that as two classes. So it was a 
theoretical 12-hour load, and some people did

09:35.190 --> 09:37.210
have 12-hour loads. If you taught speech, for 
instance, you always had a 12-hour load. But since

09:41.630 --> 09:44.650
they would count a class of 100, which I frequently 
had, it was a nine-hour load. Now the introductory

09:48.630 --> 09:50.650
survey courses had about how many students, the 
freshman English courses? Oh, the freshman

09:54.630 --> 09:56.650
English courses. They had, as now, a limit of 25, 
but they were often smaller. Often you'd have 17 or

10:04.630 --> 10:07.650
18 students in there. Now, of course, they're 
always jammed. As you were being introduced into

10:09.630 --> 10:13.650
the department, describe how the department 
received you. How did they accept you or not accept

10:18.269 --> 10:21.150
you? They didn't quite know what to do with me. I was 
an instructor with a master's degree. Ph.D.s were

10:27.160 --> 10:29.180
not required for tenure-track work then. And in 
fact, some of the people, Steve Jernigan was there

10:33.160 --> 10:35.180
too. And Steve and Sid and several others, Frank 
for that matter, did not have Ph.D.s. So that

10:41.160 --> 10:43.180
wasn't a problem. I was the youngest person in the 
department. That was kind of a problem. I kind of

10:49.010 --> 10:51.030
fell between the graduate, in their minds, I kind 
of fell between the graduate students and the

10:54.010 --> 10:56.030
professors. The graduate students were a very 
motley bunch then. I

10:59.010 --> 11:03.870
was not, I think I was just kind of accepted by the 
younger people in the faculty who were still

11:10.220 --> 11:13.240
considerably older than I, and overlooked 
entirely by the older people. Some of them, Carol

11:16.220 --> 11:18.240
Laverty, for instance, persisted on thinking, in 
thinking I was a graduate student. And then the

11:22.220 --> 11:24.420
other people in the building didn't consider me, 
that is people outside the English department. I

11:30.430 --> 11:32.450
was constantly challenged on my right to use the 
elevator. People would say, what department are

11:36.740 --> 11:39.740
you in? And sometimes I got a little bit irritated 
with this. And the graduate program was a master's

11:46.100 --> 11:48.120
degree only at that point? No, it wasn't. It was a 
Ph.D. program. But Ph.D. was already authorized.

11:51.100 --> 11:53.120
Yes, and I think that they graduated the first one 
about the year before I came or the year I came. In

11:57.100 --> 11:59.120
terms of scholarship and reputation, who were the 
people best known in the department? Well, no one

12:04.100 --> 12:06.120
had published anything. I mean, Frank Pierce 
wrote mystery stories. He was one of the best

12:09.100 --> 12:12.120
published. Hurth and two of the others, I think 
Laverty and somebody else, had written a

12:18.720 --> 12:22.150
textbook. That was used in the basic literature 
class, the 203. And Lee Martin had written a

12:27.170 --> 12:29.150
textbook called The 500 Word Theme, which Harry 
Kreuter then revised. And that was about it.

12:35.280 --> 12:38.300
Scholarship wasn't the done thing. Did you find 
anyone that you could turn to for advice in the

12:43.340 --> 12:44.361
department? Who became a friend? Stanley Archer. 
Describe him. Stanley Archer was always very

12:48.490 --> 12:51.510
reserved, but extremely helpful. And I always, in 
fact, until he died, I always went to Stanley

12:57.580 --> 12:59.600
Archer when I had some kind of naughty question. 
Can you give me an example of any of his advice, his

13:06.120 --> 13:09.140
counsel? Well,

13:09.120 --> 13:20.350
several times I had felt that I had been not treated 
right by the department or the university. And I

13:25.330 --> 13:27.350
went to Stanley Archer before doing anything 
about it. And Stanley Archer agreed that I had been

13:30.330 --> 13:33.630
not treated right. And he looked over letters that 
I wrote concerning this that went to various

13:35.610 --> 13:38.630
people and made suggestions on the letters that 
were very useful. Now, describe the students,

13:48.200 --> 13:50.220
your first years here. Okay. Leaving aside the 
bunch of loons I had the first semester, they were,

13:54.200 --> 13:57.220
for the most part, male. In fact, in my first class, 
these are the ones I took over. I had only two women

14:02.200 --> 14:05.220
in the three classes. For the next four or five 
years, I had by far,

14:07.200 --> 14:12.140
I would say, oh, maybe three to one at least, men 
versus women. They were all, for the most part,

14:19.120 --> 14:22.420
they were all white. They were all, the uniforms 
were by far a greater presence. You looked out in

14:28.400 --> 14:29.421
the class and you saw mostly uniforms. They

14:31.550 --> 14:36.520
were very, they called me ma'am. They were very 
obedient, again, leaving out this first lot.

14:42.540 --> 14:45.560
However, they had no intellectual, many of them 
had no intellectual curiosity. And English was

14:48.540 --> 14:50.560
something they had to get through on their way to 
something else. Sometimes they would develop, I

14:53.540 --> 14:55.560
always liked teaching Shakespeare, although I 
have no training in it because they had a tendency

14:57.540 --> 14:59.560
to bond with Shakespeare and to actually take an 
interest in what they were doing. But, as far as

15:02.600 --> 15:05.620
learning methods and materials of research, they 
were not into this. The

15:09.600 --> 15:16.670
activities with those first students, can you 
share any anecdotes of what it was like with their

15:18.650 --> 15:21.670
excuses? Are there, did any of them ever try to put 
one over on you? Oh, many times. Share some of

15:27.650 --> 15:28.671
those. Okay, one, I had a, this was a member of the 
Corps of Cadets, and he was, he was missing for

15:36.800 --> 15:39.820
about two-thirds of the semester. And then he 
reappeared with this letter, a sign, Dr.

15:41.800 --> 15:43.820
Anderson, urologist, with a complicated and 
detailed description of what was supposedly

15:47.800 --> 15:49.820
wrong with this young man's urinary system that 
had caused him to miss my class.

15:57.240 --> 15:59.260
And it was supposedly signed by his father, too, 
and by the, by Dr. Anderson. And I read the thing and

16:04.240 --> 16:06.260
it sounded a little funny. The doctor would be 
quite so free with details. In fact, it sounded a

16:08.240 --> 16:10.260
little bit like it had been even taken from 
somewhere. So I didn't, he was supposed to come

16:14.240 --> 16:17.540
around Monday. I was supposed to, I went to a party 
on Friday evening, and there was Dr. Anderson. So I

16:23.520 --> 16:25.910
asked him about this letter, and he said that the 
student had been to his office for some sort of

16:28.890 --> 16:30.910
minor problem at the beginning of the semester, 
but he had never written any letter for him. This

16:34.890 --> 16:35.911
guy had pinched the, the stationery. And so I, he 
showed up on Monday, and I said, Mr. Smith, that's a

16:41.890 --> 16:43.910
pseudonym, would you like to hear what Dr. 
Anderson said about your letter? And he said, no

16:48.890 --> 16:49.911
ma'am, I don't think I would, and I never saw him 
again. My favorite is a youngster who told me the

16:57.770 --> 16:59.790
first day of the semester that his grandfather was 
very ill. I expressed my concern, my sadness, I

17:03.770 --> 17:05.790
hope it's not serious, oh, very serious, oh, gee, 
gee. He said, in fact, he may not survive this

17:10.770 --> 17:12.790
semester. I said, well, I'll work with you, and 
we'll do the best we can. As he walked out the door,

17:16.770 --> 17:17.791
he turned over his shoulder, and he said, in fact, 
it's almost certain he's going to die the first day

17:19.770 --> 17:22.790
of deer season. And he grinned as he walked away. 
What about classroom behavior patterns? How did,

17:31.770 --> 17:35.790
how did Aggies behave in class in those early 
years? Politely, for the most part. They, they

17:40.800 --> 17:44.990
tended to calculate what they needed to do to get 
through the course, and do that much, and they were

17:49.970 --> 17:53.020
always polite. Back then, there was such a thing as 
a gentleman's C that many of them were quite

17:58.630 --> 18:03.930
content to receive.

18:03.910 --> 18:05.930
I never had any trouble with students in those 
first years at all, except for, again, leaving

18:07.910 --> 18:09.930
aside this first lot. And a large core percentage 
in those years. Yes, uh-huh. And in general, were

18:18.420 --> 18:22.440
these country boys or city? They were country boys 
for the most part. And

18:25.420 --> 18:32.430
very few liberal arts majors. Yes, few liberal 
arts majors. And the, the, those who were, I tended

18:37.410 --> 18:38.431
not to get because I tended to teach basic classes. 
On the other hand, there weren't that many

18:42.410 --> 18:43.267
specialized classes. For instance, I'm in 
creative writing, and that's what I do now. I

18:46.410 --> 18:49.430
coordinate the creative writing classes. There 
was no creative writing. Then after years and

18:51.410 --> 18:53.490
years, Frank Pierce, I think, started creative 
writing, and Dick Costa taught creative writing.

19:00.470 --> 19:02.490
And there was one class a year. And you were lucky to 
get your ten students that you needed to have that

19:06.620 --> 19:09.640
class make. Now, of course, we have, we can't offer 
enough. We, we, especially our 200-level

19:16.920 --> 19:17.941
courses, we always get, we're offering four 
sections this time, and I had dozens and dozens of

19:20.920 --> 19:23.940
requests to be forced in, but you can't. It's, it's 
225 students to teach creative writing. That's

19:30.400 --> 19:31.421
enough students. You can't do any more than that. 
Teach them. Describe registration in that era,

19:36.400 --> 19:38.420
those early years. Wow. As I recall, there were 
long tables. There were, there was a room

19:41.930 --> 19:44.950
somewhere, maybe in Heaton, I don't remember 
where it was. All right. Now, Sabisa and G.

19:49.930 --> 19:51.950
Raleigh, or had we already moved out of that, where 
you, where faculty used to go on registration day,

19:56.930 --> 19:58.950
the students went through there? I don't remember 
where the, where the, I just remember sitting at

19:59.930 --> 20:02.950
these tables and having people come in. I would be 
representing like Shakespeare, and people would

20:05.930 --> 20:08.950
sign up. I

20:08.930 --> 20:13.570
don't remember when that stopped, and I don't 
remember where it was, but I certainly remember

20:14.550 --> 20:15.571
doing it. In those, in those early years, did you 
have any normal rules, or in your syllabus, did you

20:19.550 --> 20:20.571
have any guidelines that you gave to the students 
of what you expected? No. Some people did. I mean, I

20:24.550 --> 20:26.570
had a syllabus, if you mean assignments, and so 
forth. Yes, I had a syllabus with the assignments

20:30.550 --> 20:31.980
on it, and the textbook, and usually it was one 
page, and that was it. And, and, and, and, and, and,

20:41.490 --> 20:43.510
and, and, did you check achieve in those years? 
Everyday? No. I didn't. Basically, though, after

20:51.930 --> 20:55.170
the first two weeks at least, I knew who everybody 
was in the smaller classes. In the bigger classes,

21:01.290 --> 21:02.551
I always left it up to them if they wanted to come to 
class, and I think this is one of the reasons that I

21:05.530 --> 21:07.510
never had any trouble with students during those, 
during that time period because I didn't make them

21:09.490 --> 21:10.831
come to class. If they missed a quiz, they could not 
make it up. The assignment dates, though,

21:13.430 --> 21:26.140
including the quizzes, were on the sheet, so

21:13.430 --> 21:26.140
anyone who could

21:26.120 --> 21:33.900
do satisfactory work without attending the 
lectures, maybe by reading the textbook and the

21:33.880 --> 21:36.940
other materials, that was all right with me. All 
right. And you were a pioneer female faculty

21:37.647 --> 21:40.940
member. Did women students turn to you 
occasionally for any advice or counsel?

21:45.920 --> 21:56.210
Actually,

21:45.920 --> 21:56.210
the students who came to me for advice and counsel 
back then were mostly men, young men. I think

21:58.190 --> 22:05.040
they saw me as mama. As far as the young women were 
concerned, I don't know where they went, but they

22:05.020 --> 22:11.160
didn't come to me. And what was the normal title 
that the students gave you when they spoke to you?

22:19.950 --> 22:23.350
They tended to call me Mrs. McCann. Of course, I did 
not have a Ph.D. then. So I wouldn't... I would not

22:26.330 --> 22:27.351
have been Dr. McCann. But they tended to call me 
Mrs. McCann. And they were polite. And they were

22:29.540 --> 22:30.561
polite. Mrs. McCann, ma'am. All right. Let's back 
up a little and describe how it was to get settled

22:31.805 --> 22:33.560
into this community. Yes.

22:37.546 --> 22:55.920
Now,

22:37.546 --> 22:55.920
Hugh came

22:37.546 --> 22:55.920
out a couple of weeks after he was hired, he came out 
and stayed with Manuel Davenport for three or four

22:55.900 --> 22:56.921
days. And bought a house. And the

23:00.250 --> 23:06.930
house cost $19,000. It was on Carter Creek 
Parkway. And it was a nice little brick house, it

23:07.910 --> 23:18.440
had three bedrooms in a very pleasant area. Uh,

23:18.420 --> 23:22.820
so we didn't have any trouble with that. And the 
children were not yet school age or were they...

23:26.820 --> 23:27.841
No, they were not. And we took them to French's 
Royal Tat. Mm hmm. which actually worked out very

23:31.010 --> 23:34.000
well for my daughter. I think it was not the right 
place for my son, but I didn't know that then. It

23:38.200 --> 23:39.241
seemed fine. Do you remember what that daycare 
cost then? Yeah, it cost $65 a month for one, and I

23:48.580 --> 23:51.840
think $95, yeah. I reduced right over to it. And 
your neighbors, how were they in being receptive

23:58.800 --> 24:01.860
to a newcomer? Well, I didn't like the neighbors, 
frankly. I thought them bigots.

24:09.790 --> 24:16.970
For one thing, we had a maid, as everybody did then, 
and they were very upset because I let the maid

24:18.530 --> 24:20.610
bring her little girl to play with my little girl, 
and this caused all kinds of problems. So I didn't

24:25.520 --> 24:28.460
get on very well with the neighbors. I did also, 
before I worked in the fall, I did go to some of their

24:32.700 --> 24:34.520
little cafes. They had coffee clutches, and I 
hated them. That is, not the neighbors, but those

24:37.260 --> 24:41.760
morning coffees where people would discuss their 
families and their lives. And to me, it seemed

24:45.380 --> 24:50.320
extremely limited and sterile. And this led to my 
being very anxious to get out of there and talk to

24:54.740 --> 24:57.460
Emanuel Davenport about the possibility of 
escape. But no, the neighbors were not neighbors I

24:58.468 --> 25:02.320
would have chosen. They were not affiliated with 
the neighbors. The neighbors I liked, too, were

25:05.030 --> 25:10.840
the three of them. With the university, they 
worked in a factory, and now I can't think where, or

25:14.660 --> 25:19.390
which. Was it a shoe factory? It could have been a 
shoe factory. I don't remember, but I do remember

25:24.310 --> 25:26.580
that neighbors on both sides worked in a factory 
and were friends. And the

25:28.460 --> 25:33.310
neighbor behind us, I liked him somewhat better, 
that he was military. And they were at all

25:37.430 --> 25:38.960
different places. They held themselves aloof, 
the capertins. They had a bigger house, and they

25:43.480 --> 25:47.320
kind of didn't socialize too much with the rest of 
us. In fact, there was a whole little enclave of

25:47.360 --> 25:50.660
bigger houses across the street. But once I got out 
of the neighborhood, it was pleasant enough. I

25:57.920 --> 25:59.860
mean, it was certainly a nice place to live. The 
neighbors were decent people. They were just very

26:02.700 --> 26:04.660
narrow-minded. What about shopping? There was 
nothing much. There was the Townsend Shopping

26:08.100 --> 26:11.520
Center, and that was it. There was, I believe, a 
Sears there. There was a pharmacy with a

26:15.420 --> 26:25.890
little diner in it, where they used to have 
pharmacies. And we only had one car. So actually,

26:29.430 --> 26:36.570
the semester I spent home alone was not fun because 
I didn't have the car either, and I had the little

26:36.550 --> 26:39.730
girl. But what I would do would be to wheel her And 
then we would go to the Townshire Shopping Center.

26:44.990 --> 26:48.790
And there we would have, like, ice cream sundaes at 
the little diner inside it, and go to Sears maybe.

26:56.540 --> 26:58.201
But there was not much. There was a Kroger's that 
was. Now we're Hastings, you know, Manner East.

27:09.110 --> 27:11.290
And there was the Townshire Shopping Center. And 
there was downtown College Station. And one

27:14.010 --> 27:16.730
thing, I mean, downtown Bryan, I'm sorry. There 
was nothing downtown College Station except for a

27:18.910 --> 27:22.810
couple of shoe places and barbershops and all the 
student bars. One thing I noticed, though, was

27:25.730 --> 27:28.270
that back then, when you came into town, all the 
local merchants gave you these credit cards. They

27:32.650 --> 27:35.730
called you up, and they gave you credit cards that 
were good for their own stores, Beverly, Braley. I

27:39.820 --> 27:41.780
understand something terrible happened to him. 
He just retired. And he was killed in an accident.

27:46.600 --> 27:47.721
It probably wasn't an accident. Yeah, don't put 
that in the... I forgot about the machine. Let's

27:55.840 --> 27:56.646
see. Did you become involved in any community 
activities? Not right away. After I started

28:03.910 --> 28:05.890
working, I did. Because I must say that I had a lot 
more leisure as an instructor and then later as a

28:09.810 --> 28:13.430
lecturer even than I have now. Now, any spare time 
is immediately filled in. Back then, I just taught

28:18.950 --> 28:21.190
my classes and went home, so I was a Girl Scout 
leader. I worked at the Bryan City Mission. I

28:25.590 --> 28:28.530
worked for the Brazos Valley Literacy Council. I 
did all these things. Church, synagogue, did you

28:31.230 --> 28:33.850
attend? Oh, yeah, we're Catholic. We went to 
church. Which, describe the parish y'all

28:36.510 --> 28:39.010
attended. Back then, we attended, let's see. We 
attended St. Mary's. And it was not that different

28:44.090 --> 28:49.260
from the way it is now. I mean, it was full of Aggies.

28:56.690 --> 28:57.671
Yeah, that was it. St. Mary's was our parish for 
years and years. And then once they built St.

29:00.290 --> 29:01.951
Thomas, we sort of moved over there. But what 
frequently happens is that my husband goes to St.

29:07.630 --> 29:10.910
Thomas Aquinas and I still go to St. Mary's 
because, A, I don't like to get up to go to the 830

29:10.890 --> 29:13.870
Mass, and, B, I like going to St. Mary's. This man, 
Manuel Davenport. Since I won't be able to

29:18.370 --> 29:20.230
interview him, tell me as much as you can. How did 
y'all come to know him in the first place? And then

29:25.150 --> 29:27.810
describe him as much as you can because we need to be 
sure to include him in this reservoir. Yeah. He,

29:32.116 --> 29:36.110
first of all, invited you to stay with him and look 
for a house and then helped you find a house. But how

29:38.690 --> 29:40.390
did they even... He hired you. Oh. There was a 
search and he hired you. Oh, in philosophy? Yeah.

29:47.440 --> 29:48.141
Oh, I'm sorry. Yeah, no, no problem. But there was a 
search in philosophy and they hired you. And then

29:53.480 --> 29:57.140
they invited him to come out and stay with them and 
find accommodations. So he did that. And I was, at

30:00.460 --> 30:01.821
this time, pregnant. And I told him that I wanted a 
house. I said I wanted to start with a house. So,

30:07.200 --> 30:09.160
although we didn't have very much money, with my 
parents' help, it was possible to buy this house.

30:14.520 --> 30:17.320
And back then, too, it was much easier to get a bank 
loan. There wasn't much. You know, you were an A&M

30:19.380 --> 30:21.180
professor. You could have the loan. So we got this 
house on Carter Creek Parkway. But the Davenports

30:25.680 --> 30:28.300
were very nice to Hugh. And I can't imagine that 
happening now, that you hire somebody and the head

30:31.600 --> 30:34.920
invites this person to stay with them for three or 
four days and helps them find a house. So then we

30:40.240 --> 30:41.221
came out. And I liked the philosophy department 
immediately. It was about how many? I would say...

30:50.960 --> 30:52.481
I would say about six. There was Ed Harris and 
Davenport and Stadelman and Becca. Who am I

31:03.260 --> 31:04.281
missing?

31:08.850 --> 31:11.210
I don't think there was anybody else besides Hugh. 
Those are the people I remember from parties. That

31:13.770 --> 31:15.790
is, as permanent members.
