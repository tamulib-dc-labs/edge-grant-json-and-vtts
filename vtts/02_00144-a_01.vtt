One, two, three, four, one, two, three, four, one, two, three.

00:10.379 --> 00:11.360
Testing, testing.

00:11.501 --> 00:13.723
One, two, three, four, one, two, three.

00:14.785 --> 00:16.607
One, two, three, four, one, two, three.

00:19.010 --> 00:30.544
This is Tuesday, September the 5th in the Blocker Building and have the honor and pleasure of chatting with Dr. Janet McCann, Professor of English,

00:31.030 --> 00:33.714
about her years here at Texas A&M.

00:34.896 --> 00:44.971
To introduce yourself to someone who might read this transcription or hear the tape many years in the future, describe, if you will, your background.

00:45.011 --> 00:45.772
Where'd you grow up?

00:45.872 --> 00:46.854
What did parents do?

00:46.954 --> 00:49.257
Where'd you go to high school and then college?

00:49.337 --> 00:50.880
Experience before coming to A&M.

00:51.481 --> 00:51.921
Okay.

00:52.923 --> 00:54.485
I grew up in Newark, Delaware.

00:54.525 --> 00:59.012
My mother was a language teacher and my father was a chemist.

01:00.022 --> 01:07.513
I went to the University of Delaware at first and then I got thrown out of the University of Delaware for producing an illegal newspaper.

01:09.075 --> 01:14.102
After that I went to Otterbein College and I graduated from there in 1963.

01:15.885 --> 01:22.614
And then I went on to the University of Pittsburgh for my graduate degree.

01:22.755 --> 01:27.902
I got the master's degree in 1964 and then

01:28.456 --> 01:30.279
I was married in 65.

01:30.619 --> 01:36.429
I had, though by that time, completed my coursework.

01:37.571 --> 01:45.884
And so I finished up my doctoral degree at the University of Pittsburgh to receive it in 1974, ten years later.

01:47.427 --> 01:48.689
But I came out here in 1968.

01:49.129 --> 01:53.957
How did you and A&M become connected?

01:54.207 --> 01:59.593
My husband took a job here in 1968, and that's when the job market slammed shut.

02:00.774 --> 02:02.416
Before that, there were lots of jobs.

02:03.337 --> 02:09.504
And in fact, with my master's degree in 64, I was offered a whole bunch of jobs.

02:10.625 --> 02:14.750
But then all of a sudden, everything closed down.

02:16.091 --> 02:17.633
And Hugh looked for a job.

02:18.575 --> 02:24.505
all over, and finally found a job at Texas A&M, so he came out here to start teaching in the fall of 1964.

02:25.106 --> 02:32.138
At that time we had one daughter, Stephanie, and I was pregnant with the second child.

02:33.681 --> 02:35.865
Did you begin teaching that year here?

02:36.506 --> 02:38.570
Yes, I did, but not at first.

02:38.830 --> 02:39.772
I came out in the fall.

02:39.872 --> 02:44.059
Lee Martin was then chair of the English department.

02:45.541 --> 02:53.651
There was a professor who apparently had been behaving reprehensibly, and this person was booted out without ceremony.

02:54.993 --> 03:05.566
And then Lee Martin hired me to take his place in the middle of the second semester in 1969, the spring of 1969, mid-semester I was hired.

03:06.027 --> 03:12.375
So I took over classes, one Shakespeare class and two argumentation classes, and I was hired as an instructor then.

03:13.165 --> 03:16.290
This is the only time I will ask you about salary.

03:16.330 --> 03:19.214
What was the beginning salary in 1969?

03:19.654 --> 03:22.899
The beginning salary was $8,000 a year.

03:23.260 --> 03:28.668
However, we didn't get raises and I got that $8,000 a year for many years after that.

03:30.691 --> 03:34.056
So there really wasn't a search process or a search committee or anything?

03:34.076 --> 03:34.957
No, there certainly wasn't.

03:35.077 --> 03:36.439
In fact,

03:37.432 --> 03:40.095
I had sent in when I came out here and looked around.

03:40.155 --> 03:44.140
Actually, I kind of suffered from culture shock because we'd just come from the University of Chicago.

03:44.180 --> 03:46.644
And this place was very different from the rest of the world then.

03:47.384 --> 03:51.309
For one thing, in the rest of the world, not everybody had pickups with gun racks in them.

03:51.650 --> 03:57.357
This was something that struck my eye when I got off the bus because I came out on a bus.

03:57.517 --> 04:06.949
For another, they then had in the Eagle, which was then the Bryan Eagle, they had a weekend, every weekend, they had a violent death toll.

04:07.148 --> 04:13.139
which included stabbings and shootings and drownings as well as car crashes.

04:13.800 --> 04:16.304
So I came here, and I thought I was on Mars.

04:17.086 --> 04:24.419
I didn't like the activities for women because we were kind of supposed to be faculty wives, and this is not what I thought I trained for.

04:24.479 --> 04:30.810
And so I was bored, and I sent a resume.

04:30.875 --> 04:36.166
I was my newly minted master's on it, to the head of the English department.

04:36.226 --> 04:37.749
Of course, I didn't get any response.

04:38.831 --> 04:48.451
And I was complaining to Manuel Davenport at a rather well-oiled party about how crummy things were and how I wanted something to do.

04:48.511 --> 04:51.718
And he said, go in and introduce yourself to the department chair.

04:52.475 --> 04:53.276
And so I did this.

04:53.716 --> 04:59.403
I was very uneasy about this kind of thing, but I went in, I said, hello, I'm Janet McCann, I'd like a job.

04:59.483 --> 05:02.066
He said, well, I'll see what I can do for you next year.

05:02.086 --> 05:04.588
And this was?

05:04.869 --> 05:07.071
This was in the beginning of the spring.

05:07.091 --> 05:08.172
And who was the department?

05:08.192 --> 05:08.653
Lee Martin.

05:08.673 --> 05:10.956
This was Lee, your company.

05:11.256 --> 05:13.659
And he said, see what he could do for me in the fall.

05:13.739 --> 05:16.021
He said he might have a class or two that nobody wanted.

05:16.562 --> 05:21.267
Well, about a month later, he called me up and said, can you start teaching Monday?

05:22.715 --> 05:26.220
So that was my beginning.

05:26.461 --> 05:28.564
And this was to replace the faculty member?

05:28.684 --> 05:31.088
Who had been given the royal toe, yes.

05:32.730 --> 05:37.277
Would it be appropriate on this to discuss his alleged shortcomings?

05:42.124 --> 05:42.886
Probably not.

05:44.548 --> 05:45.870
They were fairly spectacular.

05:50.457 --> 05:59.993
Okay, so I was hired to fill in for someone who had been fired, and I was not told any of the background of the situation.

06:00.433 --> 06:02.276
And this was about what point in the semester?

06:02.457 --> 06:03.939
This was in the middle of the semester.

06:04.720 --> 06:06.123
So I had a bunch of students.

06:06.583 --> 06:11.892
I got a grade book with a bunch of grades, and these students seemed extremely disorderly and rude.

06:12.766 --> 06:28.770
And I had not got the impression that Aggies were like that, but due to apparently the strained relationships with the previous instructor, about which I was told nothing, I had a bunch of loony students all semester.

06:29.511 --> 06:31.614
They said and did strange things in class.

06:32.475 --> 06:37.963
They showed up when they felt like it and left when they felt like it.

06:38.416 --> 06:42.923
I was going not, I was going to not teach here anymore.

06:42.944 --> 06:44.807
I was going to look for something somewhere else.

06:46.189 --> 06:57.888
But somebody confided in me that the previous instructor had set up bad relationships with the students and therefore I should give it another chance and take another semester if offered, so I did.

06:57.969 --> 06:59.852
And of course they were completely different the second time.

07:00.052 --> 07:03.698
All right, now those first classes you taught were what level courses?

07:03.728 --> 07:08.016
I had a Shakespeare course, which was interesting, upper-level Shakespeare course.

07:08.116 --> 07:09.519
Well, it's not upper-level, really.

07:09.539 --> 07:10.160
It's 212.

07:11.222 --> 07:12.845
Back then, there were very few courses.

07:13.687 --> 07:17.695
And this is one thing that makes it very different from now.

07:18.216 --> 07:21.101
There was no real hierarchy within the department.

07:22.323 --> 07:24.808
That is, everybody taught the same thing.

07:25.598 --> 07:28.522
There was not a lot of fighting for classes.

07:28.562 --> 07:32.487
There were very few graduate classes, and they were, the graduate program was new.

07:33.127 --> 07:37.052
The graduate classes were taught by the same people every time, so there was no fighting for those.

07:38.074 --> 07:45.002
And otherwise, everybody taught the same survey classes, world lit, American lit, British lit.

07:45.583 --> 07:46.484
There was Shakespeare.

07:46.504 --> 07:48.426
I think there was, there was Chaucer.

07:48.687 --> 07:49.908
I didn't ever teach that.

07:50.609 --> 07:55.335
There were, there were classes in argumentation and freshman composition.

07:55.501 --> 08:06.794
But we all took our turn teaching them, and I believe it was the head's position that everybody should have a class of freshman English a year, so we all did.

08:06.814 --> 08:08.676
The department was located?

08:08.716 --> 08:11.860
The department was in the academic building.

08:12.140 --> 08:18.247
Describe it physically, about how many people and who were the senior folks?

08:18.467 --> 08:22.051
Okay, the senior, there was John Paul Abbott and Carol Laverty.

08:23.954 --> 08:25.255
There was Harrison Hearth.

08:26.348 --> 08:37.204
There were Sid Cox and, oh gosh, scheduling fellow, Curtis Shoddy, who's still around.

08:40.309 --> 08:41.371
Frank Pierce was there.

08:44.295 --> 08:45.497
And I'm trying to think of others.

08:45.517 --> 08:47.139
There was somebody named John Gwynne.

08:48.541 --> 08:49.082
It was E.E.

08:49.102 --> 08:49.723
Stokes.

08:51.205 --> 08:59.612
There was a woman, one woman named Muriel Seville, and she was only there briefly, and she was the only woman who was a regular faculty member.

08:59.973 --> 09:02.475
So one full-time female?

09:03.095 --> 09:05.978
One full-time female if you don't count students.

09:06.698 --> 09:14.105
There were a couple of students who were teaching, a couple of women students who were teaching full-time, but they were students.

09:14.645 --> 09:20.250
And the normal workload then for a full-time faculty member in English was how many sections per semester?

09:20.467 --> 09:25.211
That's hard to answer because I always had nine hours.

09:26.833 --> 09:30.996
But one of the classes was always large, and they would count that as two classes.

09:31.057 --> 09:34.620
So it was a theoretical 12-hour load, and some people did have 12-hour loads.

09:34.680 --> 09:37.202
If you taught speech, for instance, you always had a 12-hour load.

09:39.664 --> 09:48.212
But since they would count a class of 100, which I frequently had, as two classes, I always had a nine-hour load.

09:48.395 --> 09:54.343
Now, the introductory survey courses had about how many students, the freshman English courses?

09:54.363 --> 09:55.645
Oh, the freshman English courses.

09:56.126 --> 10:04.177
They had, as now, a limit of 25, but they were often smaller.

10:04.317 --> 10:07.501
Often you'd have 17 or 18 students in there.

10:07.882 --> 10:09.184
Now, of course, they're always jammed.

10:09.584 --> 10:16.714
As you were being introduced into the department, describe how the department received you.

10:18.179 --> 10:20.682
How did they accept you or not accept you?

10:21.904 --> 10:24.247
They didn't quite know what to do with me.

10:24.428 --> 10:26.390
I was an instructor with a master's degree.

10:27.111 --> 10:30.997
PhDs were not required for tenure track work then.

10:31.237 --> 10:34.642
And in fact, some of the people, Steve Jernigan was there too.

10:35.042 --> 10:40.630
And Steve and Sid and several others, Frank for that matter, did not have PhDs.

10:41.691 --> 10:42.873
So that wasn't a problem.

10:43.253 --> 10:45.316
I was the youngest person in the department.

10:46.177 --> 10:47.359
That was kind of a problem.

10:49.094 --> 10:54.921
I kind of fell between the graduate, in their minds, I kind of fell between the graduate students and the professors.

10:56.383 --> 10:58.705
The graduate students were a very motley bunch then.

10:59.286 --> 11:13.363
I was not, I think I was just kind of accepted by the younger people in the faculty who were still considerably older than I.

11:13.985 --> 11:16.508
and overlooked entirely by the older people.

11:16.609 --> 11:21.976
Some of them, Carol Laverty, for instance, persisted in thinking I was a graduate student.

11:23.217 --> 11:30.187
And then the other people in the building didn't consider me, that is, people outside the English department.

11:30.207 --> 11:33.011
I was constantly challenged on my right to use the elevator.

11:35.234 --> 11:37.397
People would say, what department are you in?

11:39.540 --> 11:42.844
And sometimes I got a little bit irritated with this.

11:43.651 --> 11:48.436
And the graduate program was a master's degree only at that time?

11:48.456 --> 11:48.897
No, it wasn't.

11:48.977 --> 11:49.858
It was a PhD program.

11:49.878 --> 11:51.079
The PhD was already authorized.

11:51.099 --> 11:56.405
Yes, and I think that they graduated the first one about the year before I came or the year I came.

11:57.566 --> 12:03.913
In terms of scholarship and reputation, who were the people best known in the department?

12:04.274 --> 12:05.535
Well, no one had published anything.

12:06.276 --> 12:08.478
I mean, Frank Pierce wrote mystery stories.

12:09.439 --> 12:11.342
He was one of the best published.

12:13.123 --> 12:13.624
Hearth...

12:14.600 --> 12:25.853
And two of the others, I think Laverty and somebody else, had written a textbook that was used in the basic literature class, the 203.

12:27.154 --> 12:33.021
And Lee Martin had written a textbook called The 500 Word Theme, which Harry Kreuter then revised.

12:34.282 --> 12:35.143
And that was about it.

12:35.243 --> 12:37.806
Scholarship wasn't the done thing.

12:38.765 --> 12:44.275
Did you find anyone that you could turn to for advice in the department?

12:44.295 --> 12:45.417
Who became a friend?

12:45.477 --> 12:46.339
Stanley Archer.

12:47.501 --> 12:48.162
Describe him.

12:48.783 --> 12:53.833
Stanley Archer was always very reserved but extremely helpful.

12:55.035 --> 13:02.629
And I always, in fact, until he died, I always went to Stanley Archer when I had some kind of naughty question.

13:04.111 --> 13:08.717
Can you give an example of any of his advice, his counsel?

13:10.399 --> 13:31.367
Well, several times that I had felt that I had been not treated right by the department or the university, and I went to Stanley Archer before doing anything about it, and Stanley Archer agreed that I had been

13:32.613 --> 13:42.394
not treated right, and he looked over letters that I wrote concerning this that went to various people and made suggestions on the letters that were very useful.

13:43.937 --> 13:46.082
Now, describe the

13:46.872 --> 13:49.915
the students in your first years here?

13:50.335 --> 13:50.776
Okay.

13:51.136 --> 13:56.961
Leaving aside the bunch of loons I had the first semester, they were for the most part male.

13:57.202 --> 14:01.886
In fact, in my first class, these are the ones I took over.

14:02.307 --> 14:04.148
I had only two women in the three classes.

14:05.490 --> 14:16.660
For the next four or five years, I had by far, I would say, oh, maybe three to one at least, men versus women.

14:17.315 --> 14:19.899
They were all, for the most part, they were all white.

14:22.623 --> 14:27.971
They were all, the uniforms were by far a greater presence.

14:27.991 --> 14:30.635
You looked out in the class and you saw mostly uniforms.

14:34.401 --> 14:36.304
They were very, they called me ma'am.

14:38.367 --> 14:42.073
They were very obedient, again, leaving out this first lot.

14:42.745 --> 14:51.994
However, they had no intellectual, many of them had no intellectual curiosity, and English was something they had to get through on their way to something else.

14:52.595 --> 15:02.825
Sometimes they would develop, I always liked teaching Shakespeare, although I have no training in it because they had a tendency to bond with Shakespeare and to actually take an interest in what they were doing.

15:02.965 --> 15:09.411
But as far as learning methods and materials of research, they were not into this.

15:11.163 --> 15:35.905
the uh activities with those first students can you share any anecdotes of what it was like with their excuses or their uh did any of them ever try to put one over on you oh many times sure some of those okay one i had a this was a member of the corps of cadets and he was

15:35.885 --> 15:38.790
He was missing for about two-thirds of the semester.

15:39.351 --> 15:55.497
And then he reappeared with this letter assigned Dr. Anderson, urologist, with a complicated and detailed description of what was supposedly wrong with this young man's urinary system that had caused him to miss my class.

15:56.843 --> 16:02.333
And it was supposedly signed by his father, too, and by Dr. Anderson.

16:03.274 --> 16:05.558
And I read the thing, and it sounded a little funny.

16:05.699 --> 16:08.223
I didn't think the doctor would be quite so free with the tales.

16:08.283 --> 16:12.851
In fact, it sounded a little bit like it had been even taken from somewhere.

16:12.891 --> 16:17.299
So I didn't, he was supposed to come around Monday.

16:17.887 --> 16:23.418
I was supposed to, I went to a party on Friday evening, and there was Dr. Anderson.

16:24.801 --> 16:34.580
So I asked him about this letter, and he said that the student had been to his office for some sort of minor problem at the beginning of the semester, but he had never written any letter for him.

16:34.620 --> 16:38.528
This guy pinched the stationery.

16:38.508 --> 16:48.025
And so he showed up on Monday, and I said, Mr. Smith, that's a pseudonym, would you like to hear what Dr. Anderson said about your letter?

16:48.506 --> 16:51.071
And he said, no ma'am, I don't think I would, and I never saw him again.

16:54.577 --> 17:02.271
My favorite is a youngster who told me the first day of the semester that his grandfather was very ill.

17:02.740 --> 17:04.823
I expressed my concern, my sadness.

17:04.923 --> 17:05.944
I hope it's not serious.

17:06.024 --> 17:06.885
Oh, very serious.

17:07.606 --> 17:08.788
Oh, gee, gee.

17:09.629 --> 17:12.733
He said, in fact, he may not survive this semester.

17:12.753 --> 17:15.256
I said, well, I'll work with you and we'll do the best we can.

17:15.917 --> 17:21.764
As he walked out the door, he turned over his shoulder and he said, in fact, it's almost certain he's going to die the first day of deer season.

17:22.445 --> 17:25.169
And he grinned as he walked away.

17:25.990 --> 17:31.617
What about classroom behavior patterns?

17:32.204 --> 17:37.571
How did Aggies behave in class in those early years?

17:38.652 --> 17:39.894
Politely for the most part.

17:40.434 --> 17:51.008
They tended to calculate what they needed to do to get through the course and do that much, and they were always polite.

17:54.412 --> 18:01.401
Back then there was such a thing as a gentleman C that many of them were quite content to receive.

18:02.258 --> 18:09.792
I never had any trouble with students in those first years at all, except for, again, leaving aside this first lot.

18:11.014 --> 18:15.402
And a large core percentage in those years?

18:15.502 --> 18:15.743
Yes.

18:16.704 --> 18:22.074
And in general, were these country boys or city?

18:22.956 --> 18:25.380
They were country boys for the most part.

18:30.068 --> 18:32.451
And very few liberal arts majors.

18:33.152 --> 18:34.694
Yes, few liberal arts majors.

18:34.835 --> 18:40.543
And those who were, I tended not to get because I tended to teach basic classes.

18:40.743 --> 18:43.246
On the other hand, there weren't that many specialized classes.

18:43.647 --> 18:47.132
For instance, I am in creative writing, and that's what I do now.

18:47.312 --> 18:49.195
I coordinate the creative writing classes.

18:50.196 --> 18:51.638
There was no creative writing.

18:52.343 --> 19:00.137
Then after years and years, Frank Pierce, I think, started creative writing, and Dick Costa taught creative writing.

19:01.178 --> 19:02.601
And there was one class a year.

19:03.943 --> 19:09.112
And you were lucky to get your 10 students that you needed to have that class make.

19:11.576 --> 19:13.660
Now, of course, we have

19:14.315 --> 19:15.356
We can't offer enough.

19:15.837 --> 19:19.060
We, especially our 200-level courses, we always get.

19:19.320 --> 19:25.887
We're offering four sections this time, and I had dozens and dozens of requests to be forced in, but you can't.

19:26.107 --> 19:30.551
It's 25 students to teach creative writing.

19:30.571 --> 19:31.753
That's enough students.

19:31.853 --> 19:33.074
You can't do any more than that.

19:33.094 --> 19:33.554
Teach them.

19:34.415 --> 19:39.040
Describe registration in that era, in those early years.

19:40.555 --> 19:42.617
As I recall, there were long tables.

19:42.677 --> 19:46.241
There was a room somewhere, maybe in Heaton.

19:46.281 --> 19:47.282
I don't remember where it was.

19:48.383 --> 19:48.604
All right.

19:48.624 --> 19:59.055
Now, Cebisa and G. Raleigh, or had we already moved out of that where faculty used to go on registration day, and the students went through there?

19:59.435 --> 20:01.037
I don't remember where they were.

20:01.117 --> 20:04.701
I just remember sitting at these tables and having people come in.

20:04.741 --> 20:08.925
I would be representing like Shakespeare, and people would sign up.

20:12.297 --> 20:16.585
I don't remember when that stopped, and I don't remember where it was, but I certainly remember doing it.

20:17.688 --> 20:24.481
In those early years, did you have any normal rules in your syllabus?

20:24.781 --> 20:30.092
Did you have any guidelines that you gave to the students of what you expected?

20:30.733 --> 20:30.913
No.

20:32.356 --> 20:33.799
Some people did.

20:35.213 --> 20:39.123
I mean, I had a syllabus, if you mean assignments and so forth.

20:39.183 --> 20:44.577
Yes, I had a syllabus with the assignments on it and the textbook, and usually it was one page, and that was it.

20:45.279 --> 20:47.164
Did you check roll in those years?

20:47.836 --> 20:50.160
Every day, no, I didn't.

20:50.861 --> 20:59.475
Basically, though, after the first two weeks, at least, I knew who everybody was in the smaller classes.

21:00.176 --> 21:03.982
In the bigger classes, I always left it up to them if they wanted to come to class.

21:04.343 --> 21:11.093
And I think this is one of the reasons that I never had any trouble with students during that time period, because I didn't make them come to class.

21:11.574 --> 21:13.978
If they missed a quiz, they could not make it up.

21:13.958 --> 21:20.586
The assignment dates, though, including the quizzes, were on the sheet.

21:22.388 --> 21:36.726
So anyone who could do satisfactory work without attending the lectures, maybe by reading the textbook and the other materials, that was all right with me.

21:37.145 --> 21:41.191
And you were a pioneer female faculty member.

21:41.211 --> 21:45.819
Did women students turn to you occasionally for any advice or counsel?

21:51.548 --> 21:51.788
No.

21:52.289 --> 21:57.817
Actually, the students who came to me for advice and counsel back then were mostly men, young men.

21:58.558 --> 22:04.047
I think they saw me as mama.

22:05.039 --> 22:11.946
As far as the young women were concerned, I don't know where they went, but they didn't come to me.

22:13.488 --> 22:19.674
And what was the normal title that the students gave you when they spoke to you?

22:21.076 --> 22:23.298
They tended to call me Mrs. McCann.

22:23.538 --> 22:27.983
Of course, I did not have a PhD then, so I would not have been Dr. McCann.

22:29.084 --> 22:30.706
But they tended to call me Mrs. McCann.

22:31.407 --> 22:32.808
And they were polite.

22:33.509 --> 22:34.590
Mrs. McCann, ma'am.

22:35.397 --> 22:42.945
All right, let's back up a little and describe how it was to get settled into this community.

22:43.365 --> 22:46.028
We all found a place to live and children and so forth.

22:46.388 --> 22:46.788
Yes.

22:47.049 --> 22:54.136
Now, Hugh came out a couple of weeks after he was hired.

22:54.256 --> 23:01.303
He came out and stayed with Manuel Davenport for three or four days and bought a house.

23:02.617 --> 23:05.601
And the house cost $19,000.

23:06.782 --> 23:08.064
It was on Carter Creek Parkway.

23:09.145 --> 23:10.567
And it was a nice little brick house.

23:10.887 --> 23:17.115
It had three bedrooms and a very pleasant area.

23:21.601 --> 23:23.123
So we didn't have any trouble with that.

23:23.795 --> 23:26.380
And children were not yet school age?

23:26.720 --> 23:27.502
No, they were not.

23:27.642 --> 23:33.813
And we took them to French's Royal Tot, which actually worked out very well for my daughter.

23:33.853 --> 23:38.140
I think it was not the right place for my son, but I didn't know that then.

23:38.180 --> 23:38.922
It seemed fine.

23:39.162 --> 23:41.626
Do you remember what that daycare cost then?

23:42.488 --> 23:46.495
Yeah, it cost $65 a month for one.

23:48.466 --> 23:50.589
And I think $95, yeah.

23:51.530 --> 24:01.004
And your neighbors, how were they in being receptive to a newcomer?

24:01.785 --> 24:03.727
Well, I didn't like the neighbors, frankly.

24:03.767 --> 24:08.414
I thought them bigots.

24:09.836 --> 24:15.604
For one thing, we had a maid, as everybody did then.

24:16.883 --> 24:21.667
And they were very upset because I let the maid bring her little girl to play with my little girl.

24:22.147 --> 24:23.629
And this caused all kinds of problems.

24:25.470 --> 24:27.552
So I didn't get on very well with the neighbors.

24:28.233 --> 24:36.219
They, I did also, before I worked in the fall, I did go to some of their little cafe clutches and I hated them.

24:36.900 --> 24:44.847
That is not the neighbors, but the, those morning coffees where people would discuss their families and their lives.

24:44.907 --> 24:46.468
And to me, it seemed extremely,

24:47.967 --> 24:57.576
limited and sterile, and this led to my being very anxious to get out of there and talk to Manuel Davenport about the possibility of escape.

24:58.337 --> 25:01.139
But no, the neighbors were not neighbors I would have chosen.

25:01.179 --> 25:05.984
They were not affiliated with the university.

25:07.445 --> 25:11.569
They worked in a factory, and now I can't think where or which.

25:13.030 --> 25:13.911
Was it a shoe factory?

25:14.612 --> 25:16.253
It could have been a shoe factory.

25:17.735 --> 25:22.462
I don't remember, but I do remember that neighbors on both sides worked in a factory and were friends.

25:23.423 --> 25:27.208
And the neighbor behind us, I liked him somewhat better.

25:27.689 --> 25:28.850
He was military.

25:32.155 --> 25:37.903
Across the street from us was Dr. Caperton, the skin person.

25:39.318 --> 25:42.262
They held themselves aloof, the Capertons.

25:42.282 --> 25:47.329
They had a bigger house, and they kind of didn't socialize too much with the rest of us.

25:47.369 --> 25:52.716
In fact, there was a whole little enclave of bigger houses across the street.

25:52.977 --> 25:57.823
But once I got out of the neighborhood, it was pleasant enough.

25:57.903 --> 25:59.846
I mean, it was certainly a nice place to live.

25:59.906 --> 26:02.770
The neighbors were decent people.

26:02.990 --> 26:04.753
They were just very narrow-minded.

26:05.374 --> 26:06.355
What about shopping?

26:07.077 --> 26:08.038
There was nothing much.

26:09.200 --> 26:11.503
There was the Townshire Shopping Center, and that was it.

26:11.563 --> 26:12.985
There was, I believe, a Sears there.

26:13.005 --> 26:27.764
There was a pharmacy with a little diner in it, where they used to have in pharmacies.

26:27.884 --> 26:30.908
And I used to, we only had one car, so actually the,

26:32.052 --> 26:39.720
The semester I spent home alone was not fun because I didn't have the car either and I had the little girl.

26:40.060 --> 26:43.804
But what I would do would be to wheel her to the Townshire Shopping Center.

26:45.125 --> 26:54.935
And there we would have like ice cream sundaes at the little diner inside it and go to Sears maybe.

26:56.697 --> 26:58.198
But there was not much.

26:58.318 --> 27:02.042
There was a Kroger's that was,

27:03.153 --> 27:08.198
Now we're Hastings, you know, Manner East.

27:09.199 --> 27:11.301
And there was the Township Shopping Center.

27:12.162 --> 27:14.043
And there was downtown College Station.

27:14.083 --> 27:16.806
And one thing, I mean downtown Bryan, I'm sorry.

27:17.407 --> 27:22.812
There was nothing downtown College Station except for shoe, couple shoe places and barbershops.

27:23.993 --> 27:25.454
And all the student bars.

27:25.935 --> 27:32.721
One thing I noticed though was that back then when you came into town, all the local merchants gave you these credit cards.

27:32.701 --> 27:37.769
They called you up, and they gave you credit cards that were good for their own stores.

27:37.809 --> 27:38.750
Beverly, Braley.

27:40.072 --> 27:41.775
I understand something terrible happened to him.

27:41.835 --> 27:47.784
He just retired, and then he was killed in an accident that probably wasn't an accident.

27:50.327 --> 27:53.933
Don't put that in the... I forgot about that machine.

27:56.337 --> 27:58.299
Let's see.

27:58.320 --> 28:01.324
Did you become involved in any community activities?

28:02.097 --> 28:03.319
Not right away.

28:03.359 --> 28:15.034
After I started working, I did, because I must say that I had a lot more leisure as an instructor and then later as a lecturer even than I have now.

28:15.615 --> 28:18.519
Now, any spare time is immediately filled in.

28:18.999 --> 28:22.444
Back then, I just taught my classes and went home, so I was a Girl Scout leader.

28:23.605 --> 28:25.007
I worked at the Bryan City Mission.

28:26.008 --> 28:28.632
I worked for the Brazos Valley Literacy Council.

28:28.692 --> 28:29.573
I did all these things.

28:30.447 --> 28:34.073
Church, synagogue, did you attend?

28:34.494 --> 28:34.795
Oh, yeah.

28:34.835 --> 28:35.416
We're Catholic.

28:35.616 --> 28:36.838
We went to church.

28:37.560 --> 28:39.142
Describe the parish you all attended.

28:40.144 --> 28:43.590
Back then we attended, let's see, we attended St.

28:43.610 --> 28:49.281
Mary's, and it was not that different from the way it is now.

28:49.401 --> 28:53.468
I mean, it was full of Aggies.

28:56.890 --> 28:57.654
Yeah, that was it.

28:57.875 --> 28:58.077
St.

28:58.097 --> 29:00.128
Mary's was our parish for years and years.

29:00.289 --> 29:01.656
And then once they built St.

29:01.677 --> 29:02.682
Thomas, we sort of

29:03.202 --> 29:08.770
moved over there, but what frequently happens is that my husband goes to St.

29:08.790 --> 29:10.453
Thomas Aquinas, and I still go to St.

29:10.473 --> 29:15.400
Mary's, because A, I don't like to get up to go to the 830 Mass, and B, I like going to St.

29:15.460 --> 29:15.760
Mary's.

29:16.962 --> 29:22.270
This man, Manuel Davenport, since I won't be able to interview him, tell me as much as you can.

29:22.310 --> 29:24.453
How did you all come to know him in the first place?

29:25.034 --> 29:25.435
Okay.

29:25.515 --> 29:31.183
And then describe him as much as you can, because we need to be sure to include him in this reservoir.

29:31.163 --> 29:38.810
Yeah, he, first of all, invited Hugh to stay with him and look for a house and then helped Hugh find a house.

29:38.830 --> 29:41.193
But how did they even, how did they?

29:41.233 --> 29:41.833
He hired Hugh.

29:43.335 --> 29:44.676
Oh.

29:44.696 --> 29:46.177
There was a search and he hired Hugh.

29:46.197 --> 29:46.858
Oh, in philosophy?

29:46.898 --> 29:47.178
Yeah.

29:47.419 --> 29:48.960
Oh, I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

29:48.980 --> 29:49.961
Yeah, no, no problem.

29:50.001 --> 29:52.664
But there was a search in philosophy and they hired Hugh.

29:53.785 --> 29:57.188
And then they invited him to come out and stay with them.

29:58.079 --> 29:59.382
and find accommodations.

29:59.602 --> 30:00.244
So he did that.

30:00.545 --> 30:01.928
And I was at this time pregnant.

30:02.990 --> 30:04.534
And I told him that I wanted a house.

30:05.015 --> 30:06.498
I said I wanted to start with a house.

30:07.440 --> 30:09.625
So although we didn't have very much money,

30:10.178 --> 30:14.143
With my parents' help, it was possible to buy this house.

30:14.704 --> 30:17.328
And back then, too, it was much easier to get a bank loan.

30:17.568 --> 30:19.250
There wasn't much of a check.

30:19.330 --> 30:22.274
You know, you were an A&M professor, you could have the loan.

30:23.035 --> 30:28.302
So we got this house on Carter Creek Parkway, but the Davenports were very nice to Hugh.

30:29.284 --> 30:38.616
And I can't imagine that happening now that you hire somebody and the head invites this person to stay with them for three or four days and helps them find a house.

30:40.182 --> 30:46.348
So then we came out, and I liked the philosophy department immediately.

30:46.388 --> 30:48.930
It was about how many?

30:50.612 --> 30:52.154
I would say about six.

30:54.035 --> 31:00.802
There was Ed Harris and Davenport and Stadelman and Becca.

31:03.244 --> 31:03.965
Who am I missing?

31:05.186 --> 31:05.987
I don't know, but I remember those four.

31:08.752 --> 31:11.086
I don't think there was anybody else besides Hugh.

31:11.146 --> 31:15.471
Those are the people I remember from parties, that is, as permanent members.
