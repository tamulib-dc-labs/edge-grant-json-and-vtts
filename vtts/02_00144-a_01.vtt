september the fifth in the blocker building and 
have the honor and pleasure of chatting with dr

00:02.984 --> 00:31.894
janet mccann professor of english about her years 
here at Texas A&M. To introduce yourself to

00:34.917 --> 00:44.970
someone who might read this transcription or hear 
the tape many years in the future, describe, if you

00:34.917 --> 00:44.970
will, your background. Where did you grow up? What 
did parents do? Where did you go to high school and

00:46.953 --> 00:49.296
then college? Experience before coming to A&M. 
Okay. I grew up in Newark, Delaware. My mother was a

00:54.543 --> 00:59.029
language teacher and my father was a chemist. I 
went to the University of Delaware at first and

01:00.055 --> 01:07.503
then I got thrown out of the University of Delaware 
for producing an illegal newspaper. After that I

01:09.105 --> 01:14.991
went to Otterbein College and I graduated from 
there in 1963.

01:15.892 --> 01:22.619
And

01:15.892 --> 01:22.619
then I went on to the University of Pittsburgh for 
my graduate degree. I got the master's degree in

01:22.759 --> 01:27.885
1964 and then I was married in 65. I had though by 
that time completed my coursework.

01:37.599 --> 01:45.890
And so I finished up my doctoral degree at the 
University of Pittsburgh to receive it in 1974,

01:37.599 --> 01:45.890
ten years later. But I came out here in 1968. How did 
you and A&M become connected? My husband took a job

01:54.224 --> 01:59.610
here in 1968, and that's when the job market 
slammed shut. Before that, there were lots of

02:00.792 --> 02:02.454
jobs. And in fact, with my master's degree in 64, I 
was offered a whole bunch of jobs. But then all of a

02:10.643 --> 02:14.768
sudden, everything closed down. And Hugh looked 
for a job all over. and finally found a job at Texas

02:20.060 --> 02:24.528
A&M, so he came out here to start teaching in the 
fall of 1964. At that time we had one daughter,

02:24.969 --> 02:32.142
Stephanie, and I was pregnant with the second 
child. Did you begin teaching that year? Yes, I

02:36.509 --> 02:38.573
did, but not at first. I came out in the fall. Lee 
Martin was then chair of the English department,

02:39.895 --> 02:44.143
and There was a professor who apparently had been 
behaving reprehensibly, and this person was

02:45.575 --> 02:53.665
booted out without ceremony. And then Lee Martin 
hired me to take his place in the middle of the

02:55.027 --> 03:02.136
second semester in 1969. Spring of 1969, 
mid-semester, I was hired. So I took over classes,

03:06.061 --> 03:12.409
one Shakespeare class and two argumentation 
classes, and I was hired as an instructor then.

03:13.182 --> 03:16.307
This is the only time I will ask you about salary. 
What was the beginning salary in 1969? The

03:19.672 --> 03:22.917
beginning salary was $8,000 a year. However, we 
didn't get raises, and I got that $8,000 a year for

03:23.278 --> 03:28.686
many years after that. So there really wasn't a 
search process or a search committee or anything?

03:34.095 --> 03:36.338
No, there certainly wasn't. I had sent in, when I 
came out here and looked around, actually I kind of

03:37.465 --> 03:46.674
suffered from culture shock because we'd just 
come from the University of Chicago, and this

03:37.465 --> 03:46.674
place was very different from the rest of the world 
then. For one thing, in the rest of the world, not

03:47.395 --> 03:51.299
everybody had pickups with gun racks in them. This 
was something that struck my eye when I got off the

03:51.659 --> 03:56.004
bus, because I came out on a bus. For another, they 
then had, in the Eagle, which was then the Bryan

03:57.525 --> 04:06.915
Eagle, they had a weekend, every weekend they had a 
violent death toll which included stabbings and

04:07.148 --> 04:13.136
shootings and drownings as well as car crashes. So 
I came here, and I thought I was on Mars. I didn't

04:17.101 --> 04:24.430
like the activities for women because we were kind 
of supposed to be faculty wives, and this is not

04:17.101 --> 04:24.430
what I thought I trained for. And so I was bored, and 
I sent a resume with my newly minted master's on it

04:24.470 --> 04:34.202
to... the head of the English department. Of 
course, I didn't get any response. And I was

04:38.832 --> 04:48.466
complaining to Manuel Davenport at a rather 
well-oiled party about how crummy things were and

04:38.832 --> 04:48.466
how I wanted something to do. And he said, go in and 
introduce yourself to the department chair. And

04:52.592 --> 04:53.313
so I did this. I was very uneasy about this kind of 
thing. But I went in. I said, hello, I'm Janet

04:56.959 --> 04:58.742
McCann. I'd like a job. He said, well, I'll see what 
I can do for you next year. And this was? This was in

05:04.886 --> 05:07.089
the beginning of the spring. And who was the 
department? Lee Martin. This was Lee, you're

05:08.671 --> 05:10.914
talking. Oh, and he said, see what he could do for me 
in the fall. He said he might have a class or two that

05:13.758 --> 05:16.041
nobody wanted. Well, about a month later, he 
called me up and said, can you start teaching

05:16.582 --> 05:21.269
Monday? So that was my beginning. And this was to 
replace the faculty member? Who had been given the

05:28.719 --> 05:31.223
royal title, yes. Would it be appropriate on this 
to discuss his alleged shortcomings?

05:42.128 --> 05:42.909
Probably not. They were fairly spectacular.

05:50.720 --> 06:00.113
Okay, so I was hired to fill in for someone who had 
been fired, and I was not told any of the background

05:50.720 --> 06:00.113
of the situation. And this was about what point in 
the semester? This was in the middle of the

06:02.466 --> 06:03.928
semester. So I had a bunch of students. I got a grade 
book with a bunch of grades. And these students

06:09.216 --> 06:11.720
seemed extremely disorderly and rude. And I had 
not got the impression that Aggies were like that.

06:16.627 --> 06:28.885
But due to apparently the strained relationships 
with the previous instructor, about which I was

06:16.627 --> 06:28.885
told nothing, I had a bunch of loony students all 
semester They said and did strange things in

06:29.472 --> 06:31.616
class. They showed up when they felt like it and 
left when they felt like it. I was going to not teach

06:38.628 --> 06:42.976
here anymore. I was going to look for something 
somewhere else. Somebody confided in me that the

06:47.545 --> 06:57.904
previous instructor had set up bad relationships 
with the students and therefore I should give it

06:47.545 --> 06:57.904
another chance and take another semester if 
offered, so I did. And of course they were

06:57.984 --> 07:00.048
completely different the second time. All right, 
now those first classes you taught were what level

07:00.068 --> 07:03.434
courses? I had a Shakespeare course, which was 
interesting, upper level Shakespeare course.

07:08.183 --> 07:10.667
Well, it's not upper level really, it's 212. Back 
then, there were very few courses. And this is one

07:13.684 --> 07:17.690
thing that makes it very different from now. There 
was no real hierarchy within the department. That

07:22.317 --> 07:24.601
is, everybody taught the same thing. There was not 
a lot of fighting for classes. There were very few

07:28.607 --> 07:32.533
graduate classes, and the graduate program was 
new. The graduate classes were taught by the same

07:33.174 --> 07:38.342
people every time, so there was no fighting for 
those. Otherwise, everybody taught the same

07:39.571 --> 07:45.016
survey classes, world lit, American lit, British 
lit. There was Shakespeare. I think there was

07:46.518 --> 07:48.440
Chaucer. I didn't ever teach that. There were 
classes in argumentation and freshman

07:50.602 --> 07:54.406
composition.

07:57.689 --> 08:06.818
But we all took our turn teaching them, and I 
believe it was the head's position that everybody

07:57.689 --> 08:06.818
should have a class of freshman English a year, so 
we all did. The department was located... The

08:09.338 --> 08:11.881
department was in the academic building. 
Describe it physically, about how many people and

08:12.462 --> 08:18.270
who were the key, who were the senior folks? Okay, 
the senior, there was John Paul Abbott and Carol

08:18.470 --> 08:22.055
Laverty. There was Harrison Hurth. There were Sid 
Cox and, oh, gosh, scheduling fellow, Curtis

08:26.621 --> 08:37.275
Shoddy, who's still around. Okay. Frank Pierce 
was there. And I'm trying to think of others. There

08:45.519 --> 08:47.141
was somebody named John Gwynn. There was E.E. 
Stokes.

08:52.206 --> 08:59.655
There was a woman, one woman named Muriel Savelle, 
and she was only there briefly, and she was the only

08:52.206 --> 08:59.655
woman who was a regular faculty member. So one 
full-time female. One full-time female, if you

09:03.138 --> 09:06.022
don't count students. There were a couple of 
students who were teaching a couple of women

09:09.700 --> 09:14.127
students who were teaching full-time, but they 
were students. And the normal workload then for a

09:14.648 --> 09:20.196
full-time faculty member in English was how many 
sections per semester? That's hard to answer

09:20.697 --> 09:34.659
because I always had nine hours, but one of the 
classes was always large, and they would count

09:20.697 --> 09:34.659
that as two classes, so it was a theoretical 
12-hour load, and some people did have 12-hour

09:20.697 --> 09:34.659
loads. If you taught speech, for instance, you 
always had a 12-hour load. But since they would

09:39.603 --> 09:47.891
count a class of 100, which I frequently had as two 
classes, I always had a nine-hour load. Now, the

09:48.552 --> 09:54.377
introductory survey courses had about how many 
students, the freshman English courses? Oh, the

09:54.397 --> 10:00.243
freshman English courses, they had, as now, a 
limit of 25. But they were often smaller. Often

10:04.347 --> 10:07.550
you'd have 17 or 18 students in there. Now, of 
course, they're always jammed. As you were being

10:09.455 --> 10:16.644
introduced into the department, describe how the 
department received you. How did they accept you

10:18.246 --> 10:20.730
or not accept you? They didn't quite know what to do 
with me. I was an instructor with a master's

10:24.454 --> 10:26.457
degree. PhDs were not required for tenure track 
work then. And in fact, some of the people, Steve

10:31.283 --> 10:35.749
Jernigan was there too. Steve and Sid and several 
others, Frank for that matter, did not have PhDs.

10:41.694 --> 10:42.856
So that wasn't a problem. I was the youngest person 
in the department. That was kind of a problem. I

10:49.225 --> 10:54.972
kind of fell between the graduate, in their minds, 
I kind of fell between the graduate students and

10:49.225 --> 10:54.972
the professors. The graduate students were a very 
motley bunch then. I

10:59.338 --> 11:05.567
was not, I think I was just kind of, accepted by the 
younger people in the faculty, who were still

11:07.792 --> 11:16.504
considerably older than I, and overlooked 
entirely by the older people. Some of them, Carol

11:16.644 --> 11:21.971
Laverty, for instance, persisted in thinking I 
was a graduate student. And then the other people

11:23.253 --> 11:28.600
in the building didn't consider me a faculty. That 
is, people outside the English department. I was

11:30.222 --> 11:33.066
constantly challenged on my right to use the 
elevator. People would say, what department are

11:35.249 --> 11:37.512
you in? And sometimes I got a little bit irritated 
with this. And the graduate program was a master's

11:44.699 --> 11:48.464
degree only at that point? No, it wasn't. It was a 
Ph.D. program. The Ph.D. was already authorized.

11:51.148 --> 11:56.475
Yes, and I think that they graduated the first one 
about the year before I came or the year I came. In

11:57.597 --> 12:03.926
terms of scholarship and reputation, who were the 
people best known in the department? Well, no one

12:04.306 --> 12:05.568
had published anything. I mean, Frank Pierce 
wrote mystery stories. He was one of the best

12:09.335 --> 12:11.337
published. Hurth and two of the others, I think 
Laverty and somebody else, had written a textbook

12:13.120 --> 12:25.895
that was used in the basic literature class, the 
203. And Lee Martin had written a textbook called

12:27.176 --> 12:33.023
The 500-Word Theme, which Harry Kreuter then 
revised. And that was about it. Scholarship

12:35.226 --> 12:37.789
wasn't the done thing. Did you find anyone that you 
could turn to for advice in the department? Who

12:44.301 --> 12:45.402
became a friend? Stanley Archer. Describe him. 
Stanley Archer was always very reserved, but

12:48.806 --> 12:53.851
extremely helpful. And I always, in fact, until he 
died, I always went to Stanley Archer when I had

12:55.033 --> 13:02.581
some kind of naughty question. Can you give an 
example of any of his advice, his counsel? Well,

13:10.408 --> 13:31.401
several times that I had felt that I had been not 
treated right by the department or the

13:10.408 --> 13:31.401
university, and I went to Stanley Archer before 
doing anything about it, and Stanley Archer

13:10.408 --> 13:31.401
agreed that I had been not treated right, and he 
looked over letters that I wrote concerning this

13:32.647 --> 13:42.381
that went to various people and made suggestions 
on the letters that were very useful. Now,

13:43.963 --> 13:49.971
describe the students, your first years here. 
Okay, leaving aside the bunch of loons I had the

13:50.392 --> 13:54.638
first semester, They were, for the most part, 
male. In fact, in my first class, these are the ones

13:57.219 --> 14:04.165
I took over, I had only two women in the three 
classes. For the next four or five years, I had by

14:05.486 --> 14:16.616
far, I

14:05.486 --> 14:16.616
would say, oh, maybe three to one, at least, men 
versus women. They were all, for the most part,

14:17.877 --> 14:19.939
they were all white.

14:22.661 --> 14:23.882
They were all the uniforms were by far greater 
presence. You looked out in the class and you saw

14:27.997 --> 14:30.641
mostly uniforms.

14:34.427 --> 14:36.330
They were very, they called me ma'am. They were 
very obedient, again leaving out this first lot.

14:43.161 --> 14:44.082
However, They had no intellectual, many of them 
had no intellectual curiosity. And English was

14:48.505 --> 14:52.009
something they had to get through on their way to 
something else. Sometimes they would develop, I

14:52.609 --> 15:02.821
always liked teaching Shakespeare, although I 
have no training in it, because they had a tendency

14:52.609 --> 15:02.821
to bond with Shakespeare and to actually take an 
interest in what they were doing. But as far as

15:02.982 --> 15:09.369
learning methods and materials of research, they 
were not into this. The...

15:15.128 --> 15:17.652
activities with those first students. Can you 
share any anecdotes of what it was like with their

15:17.672 --> 15:26.965
excuses or their, did any of them ever try to put one 
over on you? Oh, many times. Share some of those.

15:29.389 --> 15:35.938
Okay, one, I had a, this was a member of the Corps of 
Cadets, and he was He was missing for about

15:35.918 --> 15:53.936
two-thirds of the semester, and then he 
reappeared with this letter assigned Dr.

15:35.918 --> 15:53.936
Anderson, urologist, with a complicated and 
detailed description of what was supposedly

15:35.918 --> 15:53.936
wrong with this young man's urinary system that 
had caused him to miss my class. And it was

15:55.258 --> 16:00.643
supposedly signed by his father, too, and by the by 
Dr. Anderson. And I read the thing and it sounded a

16:03.284 --> 16:05.568
little funny. I didn't think the doctor would be 
quite so free with the tales. In fact, it sounded a

16:08.293 --> 16:12.861
little bit like it had been even taken from 
somewhere. So I didn't, he was supposed to come

16:12.921 --> 16:16.648
around Monday. I was supposed to, I went to a party 
on Friday evening and there was Dr. Anderson. So I

16:24.738 --> 16:34.608
asked him about this letter, and he said that the 
student had been to his office for some sort of

16:24.738 --> 16:34.608
minor problem at the beginning of the semester, 
but he had never written any letter for him. This

16:34.628 --> 16:37.772
guy had pinched the stationery. And so he showed up 
on Monday, and I said, Mr. Smith, that's a

16:38.813 --> 16:48.082
pseudonym, would you like to hear what Dr. 
Anderson said about your letter? And he said, no,

16:48.543 --> 16:52.467
ma'am, I don't think I would, and I never saw him 
again.

16:54.522 --> 17:01.954
My favorite is a youngster who told me the first day 
of the semester that his grandfather was very ill.

17:02.895 --> 17:04.879
I expressed my concern, my sadness. I hope it's not 
serious. Oh, very serious. Oh, gee, gee. He said,

17:09.666 --> 17:12.771
in fact, he may not survive this semester. I said, 
well, I'll work with you, and we'll do the best we

17:12.791 --> 17:15.295
can. As he walked out the door, he turned over his 
shoulder, and he said, in fact, it's almost

17:15.956 --> 17:22.707
certain he's going to die the first day of deer 
season. and he grinned as he walked away. What

17:26.029 --> 17:31.495
about classroom behavior patterns? How did 
Aggies behave in class in those early years?

17:38.682 --> 17:39.944
Politely, for the most part. They

17:40.464 --> 17:52.677
tended to calculate what they needed to do to get 
through the course and do that much, and they were

17:40.464 --> 17:52.677
always polite.

17:54.243 --> 18:01.294
Back then, there was such a thing as a gentleman's C 
that many of them were quite content to receive. I

18:02.636 --> 18:09.827
never had any trouble with students in those first 
years at all, except for, again, leaving aside

18:02.636 --> 18:09.827
this first lot. And a large core percentage in 
those years. Yes. And in general, were these

18:16.738 --> 18:22.427
country boys or city boys? They were country boys 
for the most part. And

18:25.120 --> 18:32.491
very few liberal arts majors. Yes, few liberal 
arts majors. And those who were, I tended not to get

18:34.854 --> 18:40.582
because I tended to teach basic classes. On the 
other hand, there weren't that many specialized

18:40.763 --> 18:43.306
classes. For instance, I'm in creative writing, 
and that's what I do now. I coordinate the creative

18:47.352 --> 18:49.235
writing classes. There was no creative writing. 
Then after years and years, Frank Pierce, I think,

18:52.377 --> 19:00.167
started creative writing, and Dick Costa taught 
creative writing. And there was one class a year.

19:03.971 --> 19:09.118
And you were lucky to get your 10 students that you 
needed to have that class make. Now, of course, we

19:11.581 --> 19:13.423
have... We can't offer enough. Especially our 
200-level courses, we always get. We're offering

19:19.333 --> 19:25.900
four sections this time, and I had dozens and 
dozens of requests to be forced in, but you can't.

19:26.121 --> 19:30.585
It's 25 students to teach creative writing. 
That's enough students. You can't do any more than

19:31.847 --> 19:33.088
that. Teach them. Describe registration in that 
era, those early years. As I recall, there were

19:40.589 --> 19:42.652
long tables. There was a room somewhere, maybe in 
Heaton. I don't remember where it was. All right.

19:49.901 --> 19:59.072
Now, Sabisa and G. Raleigh, or had we already moved 
out of that where faculty used to go on

19:49.901 --> 19:59.072
registration day and the students went through 
there? I don't remember where they were. I just

20:01.135 --> 20:04.740
remember sitting at these tables and having 
people come in. I would be representing like

20:04.760 --> 20:08.925
Shakespeare, and people would sign up.

20:12.331 --> 20:16.599
I don't remember when that stopped, and I don't 
remember where it was, but I certainly remember

20:12.331 --> 20:16.599
doing it. In those early years, did you have any 
normal rules in your syllabus? Did you have any

20:24.815 --> 20:30.126
guidelines that you gave to the students of what 
you expected? No. Some people did. I mean, I had a

20:35.230 --> 20:39.175
syllabus, if you mean assignments and so forth. 
Yes, I had a syllabus with the assignments on it and

20:39.195 --> 20:44.602
the textbook, and usually it was one page, and that 
was it. Did you check roll in those years? Every

20:48.827 --> 20:50.209
day, no, I didn't. Basically, though, after the 
first two weeks at least, I knew who everybody was

20:50.910 --> 20:59.601
in the smaller classes. In the bigger classes, I 
always left it up to them if they wanted to come to

21:00.104 --> 21:03.989
class. And I think this is one of the reasons that I 
never had any trouble with students during that

21:04.349 --> 21:11.097
time period, because I didn't make them come to 
class. If they missed a quiz, they could not make it

21:11.557 --> 21:14.761
up. The assignment dates, though, including the 
quizzes, were on the sheet. So anyone

21:22.430 --> 21:26.635
who could who could do satisfactory work without 
attending the lectures, maybe by reading the

21:28.589 --> 21:36.698
textbook and the other materials, that was all 
right with me. And you were a pioneer female

21:37.679 --> 21:41.263
faculty member. Did women students turn to you 
occasionally for any advice or counsel?

21:51.575 --> 21:56.520
No, actually the students who came to me for advice 
and counsel back then were mostly I think they

21:56.770 --> 22:03.479
saw me as mama. As far as the young women were 
concerned, I don't know where they went, but they

22:05.341 --> 22:11.970
didn't come to me. And what was the normal title 
that the students gave you when they spoke to you?

22:20.952 --> 22:23.315
They tended to call me Mrs. McCann. Of course, I did 
not have a PhD then, so I would not have been Dr.

22:23.535 --> 22:27.980
McCann. But they tended to call me Mrs. McCann. And 
they were polite. And they were polite. Mrs.

22:33.527 --> 22:34.508
McCann, ma'am. Let's back up a little and describe 
how it was to get settled into this community. You

22:43.398 --> 22:46.062
all found a place to live and children and so forth. 
Yes. Now...

22:50.112 --> 22:54.177
Hugh came out a couple of weeks after he was hired. 
He came out and stayed with Manuel Davenport for

22:54.197 --> 23:01.185
three or four days and bought a house. And the house 
cost $19,000. It was on Carter Creek Parkway. And

23:09.175 --> 23:10.597
it was a nice little brick house. It had three 
bedrooms in a very pleasant area.

23:21.500 --> 23:23.042
So we didn't have any trouble with that. And 
children were not yet school age? No, they were

23:26.747 --> 23:27.528
not. And we took them to French's Royal Tot, which 
actually worked out very well for my daughter. I

23:33.856 --> 23:38.161
think it was not the right place for my son, but I 
didn't know that then. It seemed fine. Do you

23:38.922 --> 23:41.646
remember what that daycare cost then? Yeah, it 
cost $65 a month for one. And I think $95. Yeah. And

23:51.523 --> 24:01.053
your neighbors, how were they in being receptive 
to a newcomer? Well, I didn't like the neighbors,

24:01.793 --> 24:03.755
frankly. I thought them bigots.

24:09.761 --> 24:15.587
For one thing, we had a maid, as everybody did then. 
And they were very upset because I let the maid

24:16.917 --> 24:23.684
bring her little girl to play with my little girl, 
and this caused all kinds of problems. So I didn't

24:25.486 --> 24:28.429
get on very well with the neighbors. I did also, 
before I worked in the fall, I did go to some of their

24:28.569 --> 24:36.257
little cafe clutches, and I hated them. That is, 
not the neighbors, but those morning coffees

24:36.918 --> 24:46.468
where people would discuss their families and 
their lives, and to me it seemed extremely limited

24:48.001 --> 24:57.612
and sterile, and this led to my being very anxious 
to get out of there and talk to Emanuel Davenport

24:48.001 --> 24:57.612
about the possibility of escape. But no, the 
neighbors were not neighbors I would have chosen.

25:01.216 --> 25:06.001
They were not affiliated with the university. 
They worked in a factory, and now I can't think

25:07.463 --> 25:11.588
where or which. Was it a shoe factory? It could have 
been a shoe factory. I don't remember, but I do

25:17.768 --> 25:22.478
remember the neighbors on both sides worked in a 
factory and were friends. And the neighbor behind

25:23.440 --> 25:27.268
us, I liked him somewhat better. He was military.

25:32.198 --> 25:37.870
Across the street from us was Dr. Caperton, the 
skin person.

25:39.352 --> 25:41.896
They held themselves aloof, the Capertins. They 
had a bigger house, and they kind of didn't

25:42.317 --> 25:47.325
socialize too much with the rest of us. In fact, 
there was a whole little enclave of bigger houses

25:47.405 --> 25:50.730
across the street. But once I got out of the 
neighborhood, it was pleasant enough. I mean, it

25:57.942 --> 25:59.885
was certainly a nice place to live. The neighbors 
were decent people. They were just very

26:03.030 --> 26:04.773
narrow-minded. What about shopping? There was 
nothing much. There was the Townshire Shopping

26:09.233 --> 26:11.515
Center, and that was it. There was, I believe, a 
Sears there.

26:16.079 --> 26:27.768
There was a pharmacy with a

26:16.079 --> 26:27.768
little diner in it, where they used to have in 
pharmacies. And we only had one car. So actually,

26:29.590 --> 26:36.696
the semester I spent home alone was not fun. 
Because I didn't have the car either, and I had the

26:37.368 --> 26:39.750
little girl. But what I would do would be to wheel 
her to the Townshire Shopping Center. And there we

26:45.135 --> 26:51.361
would have, like, ice cream sundaes at the little 
diner inside it. And go to Sears, maybe. But there

26:56.706 --> 26:58.208
was not much. There was a Kroger's. That was. Now 
we're... Hastings, you know, Manner East. And

27:09.220 --> 27:11.322
there was the Township Shopping Center. And there 
was Downtown College Station. And one thing, I

27:14.104 --> 27:16.827
mean, Downtown Bryan, I'm sorry. There was 
nothing Downtown College Station except for a

27:17.427 --> 27:25.474
couple of shoe places and barbershops and all the 
student bars. One thing I noticed, though, was

27:25.955 --> 27:32.100
that back then when you came into town, all the 
local merchants gave you these credit cards. They

27:32.841 --> 27:33.902
called you up. And they gave you credit cards that 
were good for their own stores, Beverly, Braley. I

27:40.095 --> 27:41.818
understand something terrible happened to him. 
He just retired and then he was killed in an

27:41.858 --> 27:47.807
accident that probably wasn't an accident. Don't 
put that in the, I forgot about the machine. Let's

27:56.340 --> 27:56.700
see. Did you become involved in any community 
activities? Not right away. After I started

28:03.953 --> 28:05.876
working, I did. Because I must say that I had a lot 
more leisure as an instructor and then later as a

28:06.236 --> 28:15.048
lecturer even than I have now. Now any spare time is 
immediately filled in. Back then, I just taught my

28:19.013 --> 28:22.498
classes and went home, so I was a Girl Scout leader. 
I worked at the Bryan City Mission. I worked for the

28:26.022 --> 28:28.646
Brazos Valley Literacy Council. I did all these 
things. Church, synagogue, did y'all attend? Oh

28:34.511 --> 28:35.432
yeah, we're Catholic. We went to church. Which, 
describe the parish y'all attended. Back then we

28:40.160 --> 28:44.086
attended, let's see, we attended St. Mary's. And 
it was not that different from the way it is now. I

28:49.415 --> 28:53.502
mean, it was full of Aggies.

28:56.924 --> 28:57.645
Yeah, that was it. St. Mary's was our parish for 
years and years. And then once they built St.

29:00.309 --> 29:03.975
Thomas, we sort of moved over there. But what 
frequently happens is that my husband goes to St.

29:04.055 --> 29:16.936
Thomas Aquinas and I still go to St. Mary's 
because, A, I don't like to get up to go to the 830

29:04.055 --> 29:16.936
Mass, and, B, I like going to St. Mary's. This man, 
Manuel Davenport, since I won't be able to

29:16.996 --> 29:22.324
interview him, tell me as much as you can. How did 
you all come to know him in the first place? Okay.

29:25.498 --> 29:30.825
And then describe him as much as you can, because we 
need to be sure to include him in this reservoir.

29:31.386 --> 29:31.686
Yeah. He, first of all, invited Hugh to stay with 
him and look for a house and then helped Hugh find a

29:31.866 --> 29:38.716
house. But how did they even... He hired Hugh. Oh. 
There was a search, and he hired Hugh. Oh, in

29:46.206 --> 29:46.887
philosophy? Yeah. Oh, I'm sorry. I'm sorry. Yeah, 
no, no problem. But there was a search in

29:50.351 --> 29:52.694
philosophy, and they hired Hugh. Ah. And then they 
invited him to come out and stay with them and find

29:53.675 --> 29:59.386
accommodations. So he did that. And I was at this 
time pregnant. And I told him that I wanted a house.

30:05.037 --> 30:06.499
I said I wanted to start with a house. So although we 
didn't have very much money, With my parents'

30:10.212 --> 30:14.138
help, it was possible to buy this house. And back 
then, too, it was much easier to get a bank loan.

30:17.603 --> 30:19.265
There wasn't much of a check. You know, you were an 
A&M professor, you could have the loan. So we got

30:23.071 --> 30:28.358
this house on Carter Creek Parkway, but the 
Davenports were very nice to Hugh. And I can't

30:29.300 --> 30:38.633
imagine that happening now, that you hire 
somebody and the head invites this person to stay

30:29.300 --> 30:38.633
with them for three or four days and helps them find 
a house. Then we came out, and I liked the

30:40.233 --> 30:46.361
philosophy department immediately. It was about 
how many? I would say about six. There was Ed Harris

30:54.071 --> 31:00.820
and Davenport and Stadelman and Becca. Who am I 
missing? I don't know, but I remember those four. I

31:08.785 --> 31:11.120
don't think there was anybody else besides Hugh. 
Those are the people I remember from parties. That

31:13.777 --> 31:15.488
is, as permanent members.
