00:01.921 --> 00:03.643
1, 2, 3, 4, 1, 2. Testing 1, 2, 3, 4, 1, 2.

00:09.709 --> 00:13.794
And the CETTI building, room 801. This is 
September the 15th. Chances look good, maybe for a

00:17.277 --> 00:19.079
shower. And I have the pleasure of chatting with 
Charlie Wooten about his experiences here as a

00:20.000 --> 00:29.110
member of the faculty and staff, the 
administration. To begin with, to introduce

00:30.305 --> 00:46.745
yourself to anyone who might listen to this tape or 
read the transcription, describe your

00:30.305 --> 00:46.745
background in high school and where you grew up and 
what folks did and so forth before you came to work

00:30.305 --> 00:46.745
here at A&M. Okay. I grew up in Kimmel County, which 
is County Cities Junction. After a few years in

00:54.274 --> 00:59.400
small schools like Teacup and London, 
transferred when I finally got a bus system and

00:59.988 --> 01:25.455
from the fifth grade on I went through school at 
Junction riding the bus 15 or so miles each way

00:59.988 --> 01:25.455
every day but I had a good experience with it I 
graduated from there in 1943 immediately tried to

00:59.988 --> 01:25.455
go into the service at that time I was 16 and the 
decided that was a little young. So when I turned

01:28.741 --> 01:40.496
17, in October, that year, I tried again to get into 
the that time I had, I was one of five brothers. The

01:41.357 --> 01:42.999
other four were already in service. And one of them 
was flying B-24s at the time out of Tarrant Field in

01:43.680 --> 01:49.527
Fort Worth. I'd gone up to visit with him. And at 
that time, they were still in the Macho era with the

01:53.735 --> 02:21.733
watch silk scarf around the neck and all that and I 
thought that was the greatest thing I'd ever seen

01:53.735 --> 02:21.733
So I decided I wanted to get in the Air Force I tried 
to enlist in the Air Force and went through all of

01:53.735 --> 02:21.733
the examinations and all and in the federal 
building in San Antonio, they told me that Okay, I

01:53.735 --> 02:21.733
took all the quizzes to come back in two weeks, I 
believe and they let me know how I came out I did I

02:22.102 --> 02:24.985
came back in two weeks, and they said, well, you 
passed everything. Everything is just fine.

02:26.707 --> 02:29.771
Said, you will be accepted into the Air Force. And I 
wanted to go on a pilot training. I said, great.

02:34.636 --> 02:35.297
When do I go? They said, well, we can't take you. 
You're only 17. We can't take you till you're 18.

02:42.324 --> 02:45.688
Well, I was just quite discouraged by it. So I was 
walking down the hall. As I recall, it was on the

02:47.230 --> 02:50.033
third floor of the federal building. As I was going 
down the hall, I ran into this cat standing next to

02:50.384 --> 03:06.145
an open doorway in a pair of dress blue uniforms 
with all the gold stripes up and down the arm,

02:50.384 --> 03:06.145
Marine Corps recruiting officer. He said, what's 
the matter son, wouldn't they take you down there?

03:08.748 --> 03:14.856
I said, oh no, they'll take me, but I have to wait 
until I'm 18 before I can go in. He said, well, come

03:15.275 --> 03:17.598
in here and talk to me. And I said, oh, no, I'm not 
interested in that. I want to fly. He said, haven't

03:21.463 --> 03:23.746
you ever heard of the Marine Air Force? I said, 
well, really, not much. He said, we've got the

03:27.972 --> 03:31.737
greatest air corps in the world. I said, well, it 
doesn't make any difference to me whether it's the

03:31.757 --> 03:36.864
Army Air Corps or the Marine Air Corps. I just 
wanted to fly. He said, tell you what to do. You come

03:39.708 --> 03:42.632
in here, and we'll fill out these recruiting 
papers. We get through with this. I'm going to

03:44.618 --> 03:50.369
write down on the bottom of it that it says, you know 
everybody has to go through boot camp at the Marine

03:44.618 --> 03:50.369
Corps. I said, oh yeah, I don't mind that. He said, 
well, as soon as you get out of boot camp, I'm going

03:51.832 --> 03:57.402
to write on here that they're sending you to 
college training school. Fine. Sign it up. I was

04:00.148 --> 04:04.536
almost through boot camp before I found out they 
didn't even have a a pilot training program. They

04:07.766 --> 04:09.389
got all their pilots out of the Navy. Which was 
probably the best thing that ever happened to me

04:11.171 --> 04:16.418
because I found out I got air sick and all that sort 
of thing. So most things that have happened to me in

04:16.478 --> 04:24.449
life that were discouraging at the time turned out 
to be a whole lot better than they looked like they

04:16.478 --> 04:24.449
were going to be. I spent some two and a half years in 
the South Pacific and the last nine months I spent

04:24.469 --> 04:32.160
in China. At the end of the war, we were on an LST 
going back from Okinawa to Guam to refit to go into

04:33.001 --> 04:41.813
Japan. That was the plan at the moment. On the way 
back to Guam, they dropped the bomb. When we landed

04:48.562 --> 04:53.708
in Guam, they said, okay, we're going to refit now. 
Rather than going to attack Japan, we're going to

04:53.769 --> 05:00.898
repatriate the Japanese Army out of North China. 
that had been there since 1937. Hold on just a

05:02.807 --> 05:04.850
second. How did you and your buddies hear the news 
of the bomb, and what was your reaction to it? We

05:11.517 --> 05:30.717
were on an LST, which is not the easiest thing to be 
on in the South Pacific, particularly since about

05:11.517 --> 05:30.717
that time we were not too far off the island of Truk, 
which is one of their big air bases, and a typhoon

05:11.517 --> 05:30.717
came up and started blowing us toward Truk. So the 
LST has a flat tank deck on the bottom, which we all

05:31.507 --> 05:41.300
were on cots and sleeping on it. The seas were so 
rough that it would buckle those plates. And a lot

05:45.727 --> 05:50.693
of the cots, when they went up, came down, break the 
legs off of them, so we slept on the floor. It was a

05:51.174 --> 05:52.596
very rough passage. We heard about it. At first, we 
didn't believe it, because we, well, these sorts

05:53.577 --> 06:00.687
of things come across, and they're really not so. 
But then we got confirmation, and everybody was

06:01.409 --> 06:20.822
extremely relieved and thought whatever it took, 
that was the greatest thing that could have

06:01.409 --> 06:20.822
happened because we were really not looking 
forward to having to go into the Japanese

06:01.409 --> 06:20.822
mainland, which we understood. Now, I was a 
private, so I did not know the grand strategy of the

06:20.862 --> 06:26.472
war effort. but even at that level we knew that it 
was going to be a very, very tough landing if we did

06:27.177 --> 06:35.346
go into Japan. So it, as I say, it was a great relief. 
Everybody was extremely happy about it. We

06:44.857 --> 06:55.429
couldn't wait to get to Guam and get a cold beverage 
there if we could and then get everything refitted

06:44.857 --> 06:55.429
and head out to China. So you're on Guam when you 
hear the war is over? No, we were still on the way to

06:57.915 --> 07:00.478
Guam. They signed the, on the USS Missouri, they 
signed the, I said decapulation, the treaty that

07:01.339 --> 07:15.176
ended the war. But of course, everyone really 
thought that when they dropped the bomb that the

07:16.257 --> 07:23.205
war would be over in a matter of days, which it 
really was. I've forgotten, it was August the You

07:25.582 --> 07:29.106
probably know the dates, but I don't remember 
exactly what it was. But we refitted in Guam,

07:30.608 --> 07:40.640
loaded up, and said this was the first early part of 
August. So we moved real quickly and landed in,

07:40.740 --> 07:54.036
moved into Tencent, China, and landed there on the 
Ohio River on September the 1st of 19... That would

07:54.910 --> 08:00.576
have been 1944 or 45.

08:02.418 --> 08:03.679
Spent about nine months there. We repatriated the 
Japanese army, got them all disarmed. Primarily

08:08.043 --> 08:16.952
the concern was that when the Chinese learned that 
the war was over that they would massacre the whole

08:08.043 --> 08:16.952
army. There was not a great big number of Japanese 
there because they had all the arms and so forth. We

08:23.699 --> 08:48.576
repatriated them out of there, and by that time, 
Chiang Kai-shek was coming down, Mao Tse-tung was

08:23.699 --> 08:48.576
coming down from Siberia and coming into China, 
and they were having the wars between Chiang

08:23.699 --> 08:48.576
Kai-shek and Mao Tse-tung, and we were also put 
into guarding the Shenzhen-Peking Railroad. uh

08:49.265 --> 09:18.478
which was a vital link then in the for the 
nationalist armies but uh we got uh finished well

08:49.265 --> 09:18.478
we got pulled out of there never did get finished we 
finally sort of gave up on being peacekeepers and

08:49.265 --> 09:18.478
uh came back in uh july of that uh 46 and uh finished 
up the art the marine corps tour and uh A friend and

09:19.319 --> 09:25.728
I, in fact, our next door neighbor lived on the 
adjoining ranch when I was growing up. We had a

09:25.829 --> 09:31.257
small farm and ranch operation in Kemmel County. 
And our next door neighbor named Jarvis, Jack

09:31.277 --> 09:37.286
Jarvis, and I went to school together. He was a year 
ahead of me in high school. But he was in the 11th

09:40.210 --> 09:45.057
Marines and I was in the 3rd Corps. We were together 
in China for most of those nine months. We both

09:51.060 --> 09:56.567
decided then that what we needed to do when we got 
out was go get an education. And both of us had come

09:57.227 --> 10:09.843
out of a small country school, and we didn't know a 
thing about what schools were what, which ones we

09:57.227 --> 10:09.843
should be interested in attending. We knew that we 
had to go to a state school. We couldn't afford

10:11.786 --> 10:13.508
anything else. We knew there would be a GI bill that 
would help us through. So we decided together

10:18.412 --> 10:26.921
that, well, it came down between University of 
Texas and Texas A&M. So we were in a bar one night and

10:26.941 --> 10:35.650
decided, well, we need to make up our minds where 
we're going to go. We said, OK, let's flip a coin.

10:37.692 --> 10:42.617
Head, heads, U-T, tails, this is A&M. Tales came up 
and we said, OK, there's where we're going. And so

10:46.545 --> 10:53.513
that was that was the great decision making that we 
did in great evaluation of all the options. Now,

10:53.593 --> 10:57.917
how far in advance of coming over here was that 
flip? Oh, that was about a month before we left.

11:00.941 --> 11:04.304
That had been in about June of 46. And we got back. He 
got a little ahead of me. He was already home when I

11:09.970 --> 11:11.912
got home in August. But from August until the first 
of September when school started here. And how did

11:18.887 --> 11:21.670
you get from home over here? Did you have a car? No. I 
was going to be surprised if you did. No, we neither

11:26.935 --> 11:28.157
had a car. So we, of course, we did have a sea bag. 
That's what we lived in for the last two or three

11:30.539 --> 11:32.802
years. So we each packed our sea bags up and got out 
and hitchhiked. Came down here and came into

11:41.575 --> 11:45.521
College Station, first time we'd ever been here or 
seen anything about it. We were quite, quite

11:45.582 --> 11:50.570
surprised really to see what was here. What did you 
bring in the sea bag? We brought our, primarily

11:53.455 --> 12:07.718
our, our work clothes are from the, from the Marine 
Corps, plus tried to, didn't have a suit, of

11:53.455 --> 12:07.718
course, didn't really need a suit down here, but 
Tacky pants and the shirts and shaving gear, and

12:08.069 --> 12:12.313
that was about it. I mean, we didn't fill up a whole 
sea bag full of it. Didn't have much. No radio,

12:17.137 --> 12:22.522
no... What kind of razor? Safety razor? Yeah, a 
safety razor. One of those straight-edge safety

12:26.146 --> 12:28.468
razors. I never did get the hang of running one of 
those deadly ones. What was your impression of the

12:33.573 --> 12:36.135
campus when you first saw it? It was sort of quite 
impressive, really, because we had not seen any

12:36.503 --> 12:44.691
campus like this, so we didn't really know what to 
expect. We were sort of quite confused as to where

12:46.173 --> 12:53.079
to go and what the next step was going to be. Of 
course, we overwhelmed, as a group of returning

12:53.100 --> 12:59.146
veterans, we overwhelmed A&M. We were in the 
biggest class they'd ever had here at that time. in

13:05.360 --> 13:10.008
the class of 1950, and of course they had no place 
for us to sleep. We didn't know that at the time, and

13:10.448 --> 13:31.924
by the time we'd finally gotten through 
registration and asked, all right, now where do

13:10.448 --> 13:31.924
we, you know, what dorm do we go to and all this sort 
of thing, he said, well, there'll be a truck come by

13:10.448 --> 13:31.924
here in a little bit that'll pick you up and take you 
out to the old Brown Air Force Base, and your

13:10.448 --> 13:31.924
quarters will be out there. So we waited, and the 
truck came by, a big flatbed truck. We threw our sea

13:36.540 --> 13:43.670
bags on there, and we got off 100 miles out in the 
sticks away from everywhere. And here was the old

13:44.451 --> 13:53.804
Bryan Air Force Base that still had their tar paper 
shacks up, and we were assigned to one of those tar

13:44.451 --> 13:53.804
paper shacks. Was that at all similar to a boot 
camp? We said, we have already been through

13:57.669 --> 14:02.876
this. So let's just forget about this and go home. 
Well, it was about dark by that time. It had taken

14:07.824 --> 14:09.807
all day to get all this done. And we said, well, 
we'll at least spend the night. And we did. And of

14:14.533 --> 14:18.879
course, I'm sure A&M has affected a whole lot of 
people that same way. After you spend a little time

14:18.980 --> 14:23.966
here, your whole attitude changes about it. And 
next morning, things were all right. And about as

14:27.752 --> 14:31.797
you look back on that group of freshmen, about how 
many of them were veterans, or what percentage?

14:39.291 --> 14:49.723
TASCAL, I don't remember what percentage, but of 
the freshman class, my guess would be that we were

14:39.291 --> 14:49.723
75% of the freshman class. And I presume some of 
them were a bit older than you. Some of them may have

14:57.332 --> 14:58.814
served the whole war. Some had. Now, what I'm 
talking about now is the ones that the veterans

15:02.438 --> 15:06.023
that came back versus the ones that went directly 
into the Corps. And of course, we were not in the

15:06.824 --> 15:17.799
Corps at Bryan Air Force Base, but they had enough 
capacity to handle the normal group on the Corps

15:06.824 --> 15:17.799
students. But we had, yeah, we had a number of them 
that had been in that served six years or five and

15:19.521 --> 15:28.894
six years in the military in various places. 
Describe getting... settled in how did you how did

15:31.582 --> 16:00.424
they put you in this barracks instead of that one 
how did they break you down by groups and so forth

15:31.582 --> 16:00.424
somebody in their infinite wisdom had made up a 
list and your name was on this list to go in and they

15:31.582 --> 16:00.424
did this while we were registering you were 
assigned already assigned to a barrack out at

15:31.582 --> 16:00.424
ground air force base and so when the moon was out 
they dropped us off there i forgot what the uh It

16:00.995 --> 16:07.222
seems like those barracks would hold, oh, 18 to 24 
people in it. Not great big tar paper. And they were

16:10.145 --> 16:11.767
actually tar paper. One floor. One floor. Cots or 
bunks? Bunks. They had steel bunks. They had

16:18.174 --> 16:19.575
double. And not very large. But they did have mass 
quarters for us and other facilities there.

16:29.395 --> 16:32.640
Classrooms were not elaborate at all.

16:36.124 --> 16:44.997
I took chemistry, which of course has a big lab 
requirement to it, freshman chemistry, which I

16:36.124 --> 16:44.997
was scared to death of coming out of a little 
school. And it was out there? It was out there. All

16:47.340 --> 16:48.522
of our classes were out there. We didn't have any 
classes in here. Right. Now, you all officially

16:50.925 --> 16:53.569
were not in the Corps? No. uh did did you pick up a 
nickname quickly oh yes what were y'all uh well we

16:54.961 --> 17:23.618
were the we were the uh well we were the vets now i 
later joined the court when i got after we had

16:54.961 --> 17:23.618
gotten through our sophomore year we had the 
option then of going into the corps without having

16:54.961 --> 17:23.618
to go through freshman and sophomore life and i had 
seeing how officers lived and how privates lived.

17:29.420 --> 17:32.765
And I said, if there's going to be another one, I 
know which side I want to be on. So I joined the

17:32.925 --> 17:38.353
Corps, and we had the EVET Air Force. We had a wing. 
But back to that first year, all of you guys that

17:42.959 --> 17:50.530
were not in the Corps were nicknamed vets. That was 
not a put-down word. That was a... A compliment of

17:54.715 --> 17:56.037
any. And there were maybe, how many of you out 
there? 500? Oh, there were more than that. Oh. I'd

18:07.336 --> 18:09.759
say there were close to 2,000 out there. It was a big 
group out there. 2,000 veterans? Veterans. And

18:14.808 --> 18:15.789
were the other? That's a guess. What about the 
regular, what about the plain ordinary freshmen?

18:20.939 --> 18:22.021
Were they out there yet? No, they were in here. They 
were here. Yeah. Because later they would be.

18:24.926 --> 18:25.967
Because they were in the Corps. Yeah. Later the 
Corps freshmen would be out there, but not this

18:26.108 --> 18:28.712
year. And all of your courses were out there. And 
were these veterans only freshmen? Yes. Yeah, I

18:41.020 --> 18:42.603
think they were all freshmen. As far as I can 
recall, there were no upperclassmen that had been

18:42.623 --> 18:48.835
a year or two before they'd done in the service. How 
did you register for your classes? The two most

18:52.783 --> 18:58.794
embarrassing things I've ever gone through is a 
physical in the Marine Corps and registration at

18:52.783 --> 18:58.794
Texas A&M. It was, you know, just... from this line 
to the next line to the next line. And you forgot to

19:04.495 --> 19:07.998
do this here, so you had to go back and do it over 
again here. And it was not very well organized, the

19:08.118 --> 19:15.365
mechanics of it, the structure of it. But you went 
through and selected your classes. What were you

19:18.949 --> 19:22.973
then planning to major in? At that time, I was an 
undeclared major. And of course, A&M didn't

19:27.817 --> 19:30.720
really require and you do commit to a major at the 
beginning of the year. I finally decided after

19:35.095 --> 19:42.465
taking a couple of chemistry courses that I'd be 
better off in economics. Do you remember what you

19:43.987 --> 19:47.111
took that first year, first semester? First 
semester, I took English, took math 101, I believe

19:47.351 --> 19:56.843
it was, took chemistry 101, I took

19:57.532 --> 20:05.740
a general science course that they taught at that 
time. I'm not sure exactly what it was called. But I

20:08.643 --> 20:11.866
took 18 hours, which was the norm. Describe a 
typical class day's routine. Got up at what hour

20:16.610 --> 20:18.912
and did what all? Well, first thing, we had a mess 
hall where we ate. And they had hours for

20:27.400 --> 20:33.067
breakfast, so if you wanted breakfast, you had to 
get there by 7 o'clock, I think. But we were all used

20:33.267 --> 20:39.115
to that anyway from the background, so that wasn't 
really a problem for anyone. And we had no

20:39.816 --> 20:41.898
transportation. There was, in our group, in fact, 
in our group, these were sort of in clusters of

20:41.918 --> 20:53.593
those tar paper shacks. about four or five in each 
one, and I think in our cluster there was one

20:53.978 --> 21:01.746
automobile and one motorcycle. That was a total 
transportation system. But we'd get up, go to

21:04.829 --> 21:07.532
breakfast. There were not bugle calls or anything 
like that in the military. It was all, you were on

21:10.855 --> 21:21.066
your own to meet your classes, and of course they 
had all classes at a different time. spread it out

21:21.367 --> 21:50.901
as likely that on campus you take english first or 
chemistry or whatever there we had it on your

21:21.367 --> 21:50.901
schedule to meet the the requirements of the 
profits you had up there and we had a couple of good

21:21.367 --> 21:50.901
props up there uh who were some of those faculty 
members you remember now uh just uh dr hedges one uh

21:21.367 --> 21:50.901
what was the guy's name that taught chemistry he 
was a He was a great coyote hunter.

21:57.139 --> 21:59.001
Wasn't John Beckham. No, I knew John. Was Happy 
Harry Hurth out there yet? No, I had a class under

22:05.309 --> 22:13.519
him later on here at Earl Rudders and Systems in 
public speaking one time. And y'all were meeting

22:15.761 --> 22:19.946
in barracks buildings, those classes. Yeah. They 
had some permanent buildings as well, you know,

22:20.986 --> 22:31.543
the church, the chapel, and they had several 
others that had been built. In fact, they had a

22:31.623 --> 22:41.779
couple of buildings that had been built and 
probably never been occupied between the time

22:31.623 --> 22:41.779
they were built and the time they closed the base. 
All right, so you went to class pretty well all

22:42.113 --> 22:46.098
morning, ate lunch. What did you do in the 
afternoon when you hadn't any time? It wasn't

22:48.121 --> 22:48.962
scheduled. We had our own baseball games, touch 
football. We organized. I don't think there was

22:56.832 --> 23:01.098
much central organization, but each group sort of 
organized. We put together groups for you

23:01.118 --> 23:10.230
competing with the different outfits out there, 
much like you did in... and would have done had you

23:10.430 --> 23:14.348
been in here on campus, I assume. But I don't 
remember too much about the extracurricular

23:15.020 --> 23:21.050
activities. We had a swimming pool that was still 
open at that time, a nice swimming pool out there.

23:25.358 --> 23:26.901
Was there a place to see a movie? Yes, there was a 
movie house and you had those at the evening and

23:27.562 --> 23:36.056
they were, as I recall, most of them were free. 
Every once in a while you had one you had to pay for,

23:36.197 --> 23:40.504
but as I recall most of them were were free movies. 
And did the GI Bill pay for all of that? Yes. As far as

23:45.445 --> 23:46.586
you remember? As far as I remember, they paid for 
all of your books, all of your tuition, and you

23:46.946 --> 24:06.526
didn't really, and fees, and you didn't, and then I 
think you got $75 a month in addition to that,

23:46.946 --> 24:06.526
which... That paid for... That paid for 
everything else that we had. And it did. It paid for

24:07.527 --> 24:09.529
everything that we had to have. Where, how did you 
travel if you wanted to go from the, okay, so there

24:09.728 --> 24:18.058
wasn't a regular bus running from there to town or 
the campus? No. There was really no, no incentive

24:20.301 --> 24:24.066
for us to come into campus. They were sort of 
operated as two separate units, as best as I could

24:24.106 --> 24:33.438
tell from that time, but if you wanted to come to 
town, you hitchhacked and it was not hard to do.

24:34.038 --> 24:35.060
Everybody would pick you up. I mean, anybody pick 
up What did you older veterans do on Saturday night

24:36.661 --> 24:41.007
for a good time? Well, we went to the usual places 
that 18, 20-year-old kids go through. There was an

24:53.266 --> 24:55.349
Onyx out there in that neighborhood. Remember the 
Onyx? No, that's before me. What did it offer? It

24:59.535 --> 25:00.456
was a beer joint. Okay. And... Had a couple of 
restaurants out there that were just set up for

25:02.412 --> 25:07.638
that purpose and then closed up. But you had 
opportunities to go, and you could always catch a

25:07.658 --> 25:11.882
ride into town. Was there any gambling over there? 
I know it wasn't legal, but was there a... Not

25:13.925 --> 25:16.648
there. Now, there was a place over on the river. 
Okay, that's what I was meaning. Yeah, that there

25:20.452 --> 25:24.877
was gambling over there. I never had the 
confidence and my skills at gambling to go into

25:25.537 --> 25:32.385
one, to really get involved in one of those. All 
right, for drinking in those days, Brazos County

25:32.737 --> 25:38.986
supposedly offered only beer. Right. Were there 
any places near there to buy, this side of the

25:40.468 --> 25:45.395
river, to buy anything stronger? Not on this side 
of the river, but we were off close to the river. So

25:48.379 --> 25:49.000
we just went? You just had to hop across the river, 
of course, and there was two joints right across

25:49.440 --> 25:56.911
the river that had booze. All right, and if you came 
into town, into Bryan, where were the attractive

25:56.931 --> 26:01.377
places? The, well, the ones that, oh gosh, the one 
out on Welburn, what is now Welburn. Oh, Uncle

26:10.449 --> 26:12.252
Ed's. Uncle Ed's over there. They had Arnold's. 
Barbecue. Barbecue place over here. There was,

26:17.760 --> 26:22.448
the old Texan was here, by the way. The drive-in. 
Drive-in. He had the Texan, and there was another

26:24.831 --> 26:27.636
drive-in down there. There's a name I can't 
remember, not too far from the Texan. But those

26:31.259 --> 26:36.207
were the recreationals, evening recreational 
spots on the weekends. Then back on the, what did

26:36.687 --> 26:39.652
y'all call it? Was it the base or the what? Yeah, we 
called it the base primarily. That was the gut of

26:44.860 --> 26:46.502
the base. Back on the base, there was a swimming 
pool, a theater. Was there a pool hall? No, no.

26:53.252 --> 26:54.334
So... Nothing... nothing really organized other 
you know sort of what those things that you can take

26:55.880 --> 27:19.339
care of yourself except for the movement how 
serious were you and your colleagues about doing

26:55.880 --> 27:19.339
your studies very serious uh primary concern and 
we had uh some pretty strict uh in in-house rules

26:55.880 --> 27:19.339
that uh You had a study period that you didn't do a 
lot of horsing around because people wanted to

27:19.910 --> 27:32.784
study and get the heck out of here, you know, make 
their grades and be sure that they didn't bust out.

27:32.904 --> 27:34.546
And we lost a few kids. Some were very ill-prepared 
coming in, even more so than I was. You studied

27:40.392 --> 27:42.754
there in your little barracks? In the barracks, 
primarily. And how often did you go home? I'd go

27:50.808 --> 27:53.452
home three or four times a year. Again, it was 
hitchhike. Did you go that first fall, you

27:55.015 --> 27:56.718
remember? Yeah, I went home once that fall. How 
long did it take to hitchhike to Kerrville, I mean

27:59.943 --> 28:03.829
to a junction? You could get there if you left, say, 
at noon on Friday. You could get there by midnight

28:10.600 --> 28:15.027
that night, 12 hours. There's really no problem 
hitchhiking. Well, I've had a pretty few

28:17.843 --> 28:21.587
problems, but, you know, get stranded sometimes. 
Share some plus or minus stories about Aggie

28:21.607 --> 28:25.591
hitchhiking. Well, you know, you had the, here 
around the campus, and we had one out there, you had

28:25.611 --> 28:43.191
the hitchhiking benches where definite protocol 
existed, and you didn't duck the line unless you

28:25.611 --> 28:43.191
were, you know, somebody came by and was going to 
your hometown, well, they'd let you go right from

28:43.762 --> 28:47.586
get in front of the line to pick that one up because 
it was so convenient. But anything headed in your

28:47.607 --> 28:57.018
direction, generally you took that, and then you 
took some various

28:47.607 --> 28:57.018
routes of going from here to Junction. There's not 
a great deal, we didn't have I-10 then, so not a

28:57.038 --> 29:02.945
great deal of roadways going there. So Austin to 
Fredericksburg to... Austin to Fredericksburg

29:03.065 --> 29:06.709
or Kerbel. Going through Kerbel and going up that 
way. Going into... junction uh generally

29:13.107 --> 29:41.680
speaking uh i could get uh i could get to junction 
and then catch a ride from there out to gate to the

29:13.107 --> 29:41.680
ranch and walk from there on into the house now 
you'd really you didn't wear an aggie uniform

29:13.107 --> 29:41.680
because you weren't in the corps did you ever use a 
sign we did at times yeah aggie sign and uh which was

29:13.107 --> 29:41.680
very helpful but uh During those periods, of 
course, now, I would hate to have to hitchhike

29:41.997 --> 29:57.940
anywhere, but then, particularly, you was either 
a veteran or a returning veteran, so everybody

29:41.997 --> 29:57.940
really was happy to pick you up and take you with 
them as far as they were going. Share the most

29:58.581 --> 30:03.387
positive story you can remember in your own 
hitchhiking and the most negative. Start with the

30:04.028 --> 30:04.910
negative. I was going home one time. This was just 
before Christmas.

30:12.271 --> 30:19.380
This time I happened to be, catch a ride over to, uh, 
going to Kerrville. I wasn't, the first one wasn't

30:19.961 --> 30:22.424
going, but I was going in that direction. So I ended 
up going to Kerrville and they let me out of

30:22.444 --> 30:26.770
Kerrville and it was already dark. I was got a late 
start and things weren't working. It started

30:29.233 --> 30:32.938
drizzling rain, a nasty day, nasty evening. So I 
found a fella that was going, I would happen to be in

30:33.980 --> 30:41.029
a little bar restaurant thing and, uh, The guy in 
there was handing the jukeboxes, collecting the

30:41.245 --> 30:52.598
money and putting the stuff in, and he was also 
helping himself to the beer every chance he got. So

30:52.618 --> 31:01.669
he was going through Junction on the way out to 
Sonora and said, you know, would you be happy for me

30:52.618 --> 31:01.669
to go with him if you'd like? I asked him how far he 
was going. He said, well, he's going all the way to

31:03.411 --> 31:04.552
Sonora. I said, well, I was going to Junction if I 
could. I didn't mind if I could. and ride with him.

31:09.017 --> 31:10.761
Oh, yeah, I'd be happy to have him. At that time, 
he'd had several. By the time he got through

31:13.568 --> 31:20.263
stopping, before we got out of Curville, I asked 
him if I could drive, and he said,
