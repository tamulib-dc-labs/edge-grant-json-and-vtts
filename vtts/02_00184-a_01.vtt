Testing, testing. 1, 2, 3, 4. 1, 2, 3, 4. Testing, 
testing. Still testing. 5, 6, 7, 8. 5, 6, 7, 8. Still

00:15.727 --> 00:16.529
testing. We're testing a second time. Testing, 
testing. Testing. 1, 2, 3. Testing.

00:26.170 --> 00:27.892
This is October the 4th. We're in Evans Library, 
and I have the honor and pleasure of chatting with

00:27.972 --> 00:38.445
Dr. Susan Wynne about her A&M first, her 
undergraduate student days. To introduce

00:39.727 --> 00:49.118
yourself to anyone who might listen or read, give a 
biographical summary sketch before you got to

00:39.727 --> 00:49.118
A&M. Before I got to A&M. Family, where you grew up, 
what did Mom and Dad do, I was born into a TCU family,

00:53.542 --> 00:57.891
multi-generations. Several generations lived 
in Fort Worth. We grew up also in the Disciples of

01:03.343 --> 01:07.171
Christ Church, which was affiliated with TCU. So 
it was a very strong network. My older sister went

01:09.677 --> 01:11.601
to TCU. We moved to Houston, though, the week 
before I started kindergarten, so I went all the

01:11.581 --> 01:17.013
way through the Houston Independent School 
District. Poe Elementary, the Edgar Allan Poe

01:18.376 --> 01:20.400
Ravens. I always thought that was a great name. The 
Sidney Lanier Purple Pups and the Mirabeau B.

01:23.367 --> 01:28.999
Lamar Redskins. My father, Matt Rudd, was 
president of the TCU Alumni Association in 1969.

01:35.445 --> 01:37.828
He was a salesman of everything from... He sold 
Colonel Sanders paper boxes in Kentucky back in

01:37.848 --> 01:46.977
the 50s and then went on to selling offshore 
drilling rigs in the oil heydays of Houston in the

01:37.848 --> 01:46.977
60s and 70s. Mom went to TCU as well and was 
president of the TCU Women's Club sometime in the

01:47.878 --> 01:54.985
60s. And she... worked as an executive secretary, 
probably could have done a lot more than she did,

01:57.565 --> 02:03.931
but that's another story. She was a good mom. And I 
was always a straight-A student and loved being

02:06.193 --> 02:26.273
active, loved music, just wanted to do 
everything, and was valedictorian in my senior

02:06.193 --> 02:26.273
class at Lamar, even though in those days in the 
early 70s, they said that every kid who got a 4.0 was

02:26.253 --> 02:44.515
number one so there ended up being 13 of us and only 
later when one of my buddies broke into the

02:26.253 --> 02:44.515
principal's office to see if he was really the 
number one number one he found out that I was really

02:26.253 --> 02:44.515
the number one number one and I never really got the 
proper recognition for that and I've always kind

02:26.253 --> 02:44.515
of resented it but at least I know it was me. In my 
junior, well, I guess it was my senior year, maybe

02:45.085 --> 02:51.974
into my junior year, I never thought I'd go 
anyplace but TCU. That was just destiny. And

02:54.477 --> 03:03.829
grandparents still lived in Fort Worth, and we 
went back up there all the time, active in church

02:54.477 --> 03:03.829
youth activities, which often centered around 
TCU. And my chemistry teacher in high school said,

03:05.010 --> 03:13.641
if you got a big scholarship to A&M, would you go? 
And I thought he'd lost his mind. I just thought he

03:16.856 --> 03:19.360
had lost his mind, but I was intrigued. And I 
started getting recruited by the President's

03:20.541 --> 03:25.488
Endowed Scholar Program in its early days. And a 
friend of my sister's,

03:26.109 --> 03:42.470
I can't believe, I can't remember his last name, 
John, he'll come to me, had been a very bright, fun

03:26.109 --> 03:42.470
guy, and he had gotten a President's Scholarship 
to A&M. And so that helped with the validity of the

03:44.671 --> 03:57.718
uh... suggestion but in those days the cool kids 
didn't go to A&M and the smart kids didn't go to A&M

03:44.671 --> 03:57.718
and the country kids went to A&M and so I just kind of 
toyed with the idea, but I said, well, listen, you

03:58.019 --> 04:07.090
know, come on up to campus, we'll show you around 
and give you the tour, and I just, I fell in love. I

04:07.751 --> 04:19.065
also had a chance to be a delegate to SCONA when I was 
in high school, and so spent a couple days on campus

04:07.751 --> 04:19.065
then and fell in love then, and so between having 
gone to SCONA and And that recruitment trip, I

04:19.636 --> 04:22.801
applied for the scholarship, got it. I'll never 
forget. Of course, I was a little concerned about

04:25.806 --> 04:29.973
how my family would react to the possibility of me 
going to A&M. And Daddy worked out of the house, and

04:30.734 --> 04:34.160
he was such a character. And the day that the letter 
came from A&M telling me that I'd been awarded the

04:34.981 --> 04:44.076
President's Scholarship, he got home first and 
got that letter. And there's still debate in our

04:46.737 --> 04:50.503
family as to whether or not he had steamed it open 
first or not. We really don't know. But he got a

04:51.585 --> 05:02.082
string and hung that string down in the middle of 
the kitchen so that that letter was right at eye

04:51.585 --> 05:02.082
level when I walked in the back door from school 
that day. And so this was like September, October

05:02.783 --> 05:05.268
of my senior year. So very early. We didn't have 
early admissions back then. So by... Halloween,

05:11.527 --> 05:14.973
probably, of my senior year in high school, I was 
admitted. I had my ID number. I was on the list for

05:17.959 --> 05:19.341
the dorm. I mean, everything was done. It was just 
amazing. And so I didn't even hear, I went ahead and

05:22.988 --> 05:27.737
applied to TCU. Of course, didn't hear from them 
until spring. Went to the TCU college thing that

05:30.262 --> 05:35.391
they had at the Shamrock Hotel, you know, back 
then. And I just thought, oh my gosh, what am I going

05:36.653 --> 05:39.136
to do? And I went ahead and applied for a 
Chancellor's Scholarship, which was an even more

05:39.156 --> 05:45.685
prestigious scholarship at TCU than the 
President's Endowed Scholarship was. Got it, and

05:46.226 --> 05:47.908
turned it down. Because I had fallen in love with 
A&M. And I had already heard some, you know, the

05:50.852 --> 05:55.458
inklings about the medical school. And I knew I 
wanted, I even knew I wanted to be an allergist when

05:56.159 --> 06:01.886
I was in high school. Knew I wanted to go into 
medicine. And nobody in my family had been in

06:04.649 --> 06:06.651
medicine. Daddy had an old trainer's Bible when he 
played high school football at Birdville High in

06:07.552 --> 06:15.322
Fort Worth. And I read that thing from cover to 
cover. It just fascinated me. And then I read the

06:20.568 --> 06:23.751
Reader's Digest Home Medical Guide from cover to 
cover. I just could not get enough of it. And

06:25.894 --> 06:28.497
everybody in my family thought I'd lost my mind. 
And so the prospect of being able to get into

06:30.029 --> 06:36.635
medical school after two years of college was very 
appealing to me. And I'd grown up in Houston. I

06:40.799 --> 06:42.100
didn't want any part of the medical center. It was 
too big and too... That was my backyard. I grew up

06:44.682 --> 06:49.807
with all the kids whose parents were doctors over 
there, and that didn't seem very glamorous to me at

06:44.682 --> 06:49.807
all. You know, it's funny, the perspectives we 
had. When you came up, say, for SCONA or any other

06:51.769 --> 06:58.855
pre-enrollment visits, what was it that 
impressed you about A&M? the mood on campus. I'd

07:00.964 --> 07:02.852
spent a lot of time on the TCU campus. I'd spent a lot 
of time on the Rice campus because I grew up about a

07:03.273 --> 07:08.895
mile north of Rice University and that's where I 
rode my bike and I had family friends that had gone

07:09.196 --> 07:13.022
there and learned how to drive in the Rice Stadium 
parking lot. And the mood on campus, the looks on

07:15.006 --> 07:26.405
the faces of the students, just the gestalt of the 
whole experience was entirely different. And

07:26.805 --> 07:35.119
that was apparent to me even at those brief time 
periods that I had visited there.

07:35.723 --> 07:40.627
You know, of course, this was 1973, tail end of the 
Vietnam era. You know, protests going on in other

07:42.849 --> 07:45.131
campuses. You know, my sister's friends having 
draft numbers. She was two and a half, three years

07:50.075 --> 07:53.478
older in school, two and a half years in age than I 
was. And the angst that I saw on the other campuses

07:55.960 --> 08:01.705
was not here. And I liked that. Did you go to fish 
camp? Nope. didn't know I don't know I had a busy

08:05.795 --> 08:30.705
summer scheduled and I don't really think that I 
realized how important it was and it may have

08:05.795 --> 08:30.705
conflicted with some church stuff that I was doing 
so so I didn't go all right now this is the fall of 74

08:05.795 --> 08:30.705
when you come up to enroll who brought you and what 
did you bring? All the stuff. Oh, Lord. Daddy

08:37.646 --> 08:44.236
brought me, and I remember we kind of had our 
signals crossed, and I thought I had a couple more

08:37.646 --> 08:44.236
days at home than I did, and it was really at the last 
minute. It was like, oh, my God, I've got to

08:44.276 --> 08:46.419
register this afternoon. And I tearfully told my 
best friend goodbye on the phone, and Daddy threw

08:47.140 --> 08:52.127
me in the car, and we went. Mom didn't go. I think 
Sally had already gone back to TCU for her senior

08:53.689 --> 09:01.080
year. And I remember I had a cool stereo that I had 
bought with money that I had earned working the

09:02.073 --> 09:11.204
year before at a stereo store. I just gave my 
paycheck back and bought a nice stereo. And I had a

09:14.208 --> 09:17.432
bunch of clothes. I remember I had met my roommate 
at orientation. We had been roommates just by

09:21.597 --> 09:25.142
potluck at orientation. Decided we got along 
pretty well. So Stephanie Forrest from San

09:26.363 --> 09:29.447
Antonio. And so we thought we were really cool 
because we had matching bedspreads. We just

09:34.438 --> 09:35.640
thought we were pretty hot. But we didn't have 
rugs. We didn't have, I think, more what we didn't

09:38.345 --> 09:43.113
have in terms of more than what we had. We didn't 
have a TV. We didn't have, you know, certainly.

09:47.220 --> 09:48.142
Didn't have a microwave. Didn't have a microwave. 
Did have a little refrigerator. Did get the little

09:50.366 --> 09:51.808
refrigerator. And this was in what dorm? Kruger. 
Kruger. And yours truly was the M.C. at the Grand

09:56.875 --> 09:57.856
Open. Oh, gosh. It was, oh, because that was just 
the cool place to live in the Commons. Because that

10:03.605 --> 10:05.468
was before Mosier and Esten had opened. It was just 
Kruger and Dunn. What were they, generally

10:09.353 --> 10:14.701
describe the people who lived in Kruger Dunn? What 
were they, where were they from? What were they

10:17.345 --> 10:18.106
like? What were they? In general, the Kruger Dunn 
kids were the big city, middle class kids like me.

10:25.587 --> 10:30.095
And there were some of the kids from the smaller 
towns. But in general, the women that lived in

10:31.417 --> 10:41.354
Kruger with me that I became, and I'm still very, 
very close to, that group of girls that lived

10:31.417 --> 10:41.354
together that first year. They still come meet me 
for the first football game every year. We're very

10:45.300 --> 10:46.262
close. They were from big high schools in San 
Antonio and Arlington, and they

10:47.390 --> 10:57.828
were business majors and education majors. Were 
they all, like you, not an Aggie family? Many of

11:02.236 --> 11:04.300
them were not Aggie families. Some were. Some 
were, some weren't. A lot of women, their dads had

11:06.965 --> 11:08.568
gone to A&M. And you knew when you, before you got 
here, what your career goal was and what your major

11:12.196 --> 11:15.261
was. And that was your choice. Was there anyone who 
deserves credit now for having affected that

11:17.725 --> 11:25.017
career goal for you? Well, I think the allergists 
that were my doctors at McGovern Allergy Clinic

11:25.939 --> 11:32.750
were very encouraging. My family

11:39.078 --> 11:44.887
Daddy was very proud of me, but I was Daddy's little 
princess, and pretty much anything I did, Daddy

11:39.078 --> 11:44.887
thought was just wonderful. And if his little girl 
wanted to be a doctor, he just thought that was

11:45.167 --> 11:47.852
great. I think Mother thought I had lost my mind. 
Why would you want to work that hard? We know that

11:53.861 --> 12:01.052
you're smarter than anybody in the family, but why 
would you want to work so

11:53.861 --> 12:01.052
hard? But it was very, you know, my chemistry 
teacher in high school encouraged me. Some church

12:07.987 --> 12:09.388
people encouraged me. But it was really, it was a 
very deep internal passion for me. You're

12:16.074 --> 12:20.138
confirming one thing we learned in the 60s doing 
that aspirations report. We were trying to find

12:20.579 --> 12:27.185
out who, what, how most affects a young person's 
choice of where to go to college. We found out that

12:27.766 --> 12:32.490
as often as not, parents were negative that the 
kids would rebel. But the most central one was that

12:33.314 --> 12:47.495
youngster's favorite teacher, advisor, 
counselor, particularly related to what their

12:33.314 --> 12:47.495
major might be. That is, your English teacher's 
advice would not have been nearly as important as

12:48.797 --> 12:53.584
your chemistry teacher's. And so you're 
confirming that. Fascinating. All right. Did you

12:57.852 --> 12:59.575
have to go through registration? Yes. Yes. How did 
you register? Stand in line? Yep. Standing in

13:04.486 --> 13:05.267
line. And I can remember... I took the advanced 
placement tests. Back then, you didn't have

13:12.086 --> 13:13.148
courses. It was just if you wanted to take the test 
to place that, you could. You actually got grades.

13:18.114 --> 13:23.501
I placed out of Spanish, all my Spanish, which now I 
really regret not having taken any. So I thought,

13:24.362 --> 13:26.305
cool, Spanish is done. I can cross that one off the 
list. placed out of chemistry, but it would have

13:29.457 --> 13:36.185
been with a C, out of freshman chemistry. And I 
remember the dean of the College of Science, John

13:36.285 --> 13:40.469
Beckham, what was his name? Well, he was the 
associate dean. Okay. He had a deep throat.

13:47.758 --> 13:48.659
I was talking to him. I remember sitting at a table. 
I was looking at my transcript. I was signing up for

13:52.543 --> 13:58.570
freshman chemistry, or seeing if I could place out 
of freshman chemistry and just go on to organic or

13:52.543 --> 13:58.570
something. And he said, you know, you're pre-med. 
You may not want to do that. That may not be the best

14:06.327 --> 14:07.789
idea. The seal will go on your transcript. Regular 
freshman chemistry is just going to bore you to

14:13.380 --> 14:15.484
tears. Even though you're not a chemistry major, I 
want to put you in the chemistry for chemistry

14:16.526 --> 14:20.794
majors. And of course, I was young and idealistic. 
And I thought, oh, cool. That's great. Because I

14:27.024 --> 14:34.652
remember my sixth grade teacher telling me, if you 
have the opportunity to take an advanced class or

14:27.024 --> 14:34.652
an honors class or something, do it. Always avail 
yourself of that opportunity. And so I still had

14:38.275 --> 14:40.758
that mindset. And so there were 30 kids in the 
classes compared to 300 in the big seminar

14:41.479 --> 14:47.124
classes. I made an A the first semester. But what I 
didn't realize is that they graded, it wasn't

14:51.537 --> 14:55.803
really even a curve. The top 10 kids in the class got 
A's, the middle 10 kids in the class got B's, and the

14:57.366 --> 15:04.897
bottom 10 kids in the class got C's. And so I may have 
made my first semester, but I made a C the second

15:04.917 --> 15:09.844
semester, even though I really didn't do that 
badly. And it just blew my GPA. And I've been mad at

15:13.009 --> 15:16.314
that man ever since for giving me that advice. 
But... When I took quantitative analysis my

15:18.723 --> 15:28.214
junior year, I just flew through it with A's 
because of that background that I had gotten in

15:18.723 --> 15:28.214
that freshman chemistry class, although it was 
kind of just my grade point average then. Some

15:30.196 --> 15:33.840
other important courses that first semester that 
you remember? Teachers, courses? Well, I took the

15:37.564 --> 15:42.790
big freshman biology class.

15:44.592 --> 15:47.476
Don't remember much about that at all, except it 
was big and boring. English? English. Placed out

15:51.261 --> 15:52.122
of English. Placed out of freshman English. Math, 
history? Math. I took pre-calculus from a

15:55.005 --> 15:59.551
teaching assistant who I couldn't understand. I 
took honors history. I was in the honors program.

16:03.456 --> 16:05.679
It didn't turn me on. Didn't do real well in there. 
It was, but boy, I sure enjoyed student government

16:08.538 --> 16:15.688
in Skona, and boy, I jumped into student 
activities feet first. Now, how did, were you

16:16.269 --> 16:19.494
self-propelled there, or did somebody encourage 
you? Oh, yeah, I was, I've been an inveterate

16:19.514 --> 16:36.418
joiner from day one, and so I was in, got involved in 
student, and all the gals I lived with, we all were

16:19.514 --> 16:36.418
executive aides for student government, got 
involved in Skona because I had been in Skona, and I

16:19.514 --> 16:36.418
had always played the piano in high school, and 
auditioned for the Century Singers, but Bob made

16:36.770 --> 16:42.857
me the accompanist. Of course, he was doing that in 
the scene. Bob Boone. Yeah, doing that in the

16:45.740 --> 16:51.486
scene, get up at the same time, made me an 
accompanist because he needed the piano player

16:45.740 --> 16:51.486
more than he needed another alto. And so I spent 
every noon playing the piano for an hour in between

16:53.789 --> 16:59.415
my classes. And I'll never forget my young I almost 
had too much fun my freshman year. It was probably

17:07.775 --> 17:20.013
about February my freshman year, and the Aggie 
players were going to do Godspell, and Godspell,

17:07.775 --> 17:20.013
I'd played all the way through high school, knew 
all the music, just loved it. And a lot of the kids in

17:20.914 --> 17:26.242
the chorus who were auditioning for Godspell 
wanted me to play for their auditions. I was like,

17:26.463 --> 17:27.344
okay, that's fine. You know, it's like, I'm pretty 
bad, I don't have time to do this show, but, you

17:27.424 --> 17:33.253
know, I'll play for your audition, that'll be kind 
of fun, because I knew the music by heart. And so I

17:33.233 --> 17:42.630
had played for two or three kids that had 
auditioned, and John Joy was the head of the

17:33.233 --> 17:42.630
theater department and Aggie Players back then. 
What a character he was. So this poor kid had just

17:45.255 --> 17:52.187
sung this mediocre audition solo off-key. So John 
was like, okay, nice audition. You, what's your

17:57.541 --> 17:58.663
name? He points to me at the piano. I'm like, Sue 
Rudd. Sue, how do you spell that? Fine, you're

18:04.132 --> 18:05.594
playing for the show. And then goes on. I'm like, 
no, no, wait, you don't understand. You know this

18:08.859 --> 18:10.322
music. I need you. And so I was like, oh, okay.

18:15.742 --> 18:19.766
So at one point in time, so I was the music director 
for Godspell. So I taught all the singers all the

18:21.128 --> 18:24.051
music as well as playing with the band. And so there 
were times at the end of my freshman year when I was

18:24.611 --> 18:30.657
playing the piano six hours a day in addition to 
trying to be a pre-med. And just doing government

18:31.799 --> 18:33.961
and scone and all this other kind of stuff. 
Describe during that year, describe your routine

18:33.981 --> 18:40.888
from getting up to going to bed at night A typical 
day, what time did you get up and do what and where

18:41.324 --> 18:47.114
and when? I don't think I had any 8 o'clock classes 
my freshman year. I really don't remember. I'd get

18:51.882 --> 18:56.029
up, because I always had to have breakfast, go down 
to the Commons for breakfast. How did a young lady

18:56.329 --> 19:01.037
dress in that dining hall for breakfast? We 
dressed. We dressed. I mean, you put your makeup on

19:04.098 --> 19:06.764
and you got dressed. It was not unusual for us to 
wear dresses and pantyhose and heels to class or a

19:07.485 --> 19:16.264
cool pantsuit or something like that. But you'd 
eat with your friends. Your classes, by and large,

19:21.824 --> 19:24.407
were held where? They were all over. Biology would 
be in the biology building. Chemistry was in the

19:28.092 --> 19:29.433
chemistry building. History was either in 
Harrington or the history building. I don't even

19:34.279 --> 19:34.780
remember. It may have been the academic building. 
So it was all over the place. Fortunately, I didn't

19:37.964 --> 19:45.233
have to go down to Zachary, because at that point in 
time, that just seemed so far away. And I'd have two

19:45.922 --> 19:47.626
or three classes in the morning. I'd head over to 
the MSC at lunch and play piano for an hour, try to

19:47.646 --> 19:58.792
run back to the commons to grab a bite to eat before 
the lunch line closed, and then usually had some

19:47.646 --> 19:58.792
kind of lab in the afternoon, chemistry lab, 
biology lab, something like that. We'd go till 5,

19:58.832 --> 20:03.002
get back to the dorm, grab a bite to eat. And in the 
evenings, I always had some type of committee

20:03.387 --> 20:11.196
meeting, student senate, SCONA. There was always 
something to do. Where did you study? Usually in my

20:14.820 --> 20:17.042
room, or in the study carrels. I didn't come to the 
library very much. Was it quiet? Yeah, it really

20:20.046 --> 20:20.827
was. It was pretty quiet. Sometimes I'd go in the 
study carrels, because everybody was going off in

20:21.828 --> 20:26.453
so many different directions. And we didn't have 
TVs and all this kind of stuff in our rooms. So the

20:29.557 --> 20:32.500
rooms were really pretty quiet. How did a new co-ed 
get introduced to Aggie traditions?

20:40.287 --> 20:43.711
Particularly one whose background was purple and 
white. Yes. Basically going to, you know, meeting

20:45.514 --> 20:51.661
kids that had gone to fish camp. Because a lot of the 
gals that I ran around with had gone to fish camp.

20:56.707 --> 21:02.875
And it's, you know, when Silver Taps comes along, 
you know, everything came to a screeching halt and

21:03.648 --> 21:07.452
everybody went to Silver Taps and the lights were 
out. It was just, it was a herd mentality. I hate

21:11.376 --> 21:12.056
to... When you went to your first Silver Taps, what 
impression did it make?

21:17.722 --> 21:20.545
It was, it was really an overwhelming experience 
for me. I did not know the student who had been

21:20.605 --> 21:23.408
killed. I was just amazed at how the mood And the 
energy level on campus, just like somebody had

21:34.732 --> 21:39.317
flipped a switch all of a sudden. And walking 
quietly towards the academic building,

21:40.339 --> 21:57.719
stunned by the power of the silence and the quiet 
among rowdy people who were all of a sudden quiet,

21:40.339 --> 21:57.719
solemn. It was a very spiritual experience for me. 
And then walking back to campus, I mean back to the

22:05.157 --> 22:14.229
dorm, and the whole rest of the night, people were 
quiet. Let me add an editorial note for the typist

22:15.131 --> 22:17.794
here. Somewhere about this time in the early 70s as 
dean of faculties, a group of students came to me to

22:18.255 --> 22:30.912
ask for advice regarding whether or not they 
should hold silver taps for an undergraduate who

22:31.398 --> 22:40.675
lived off campus who had gotten killed in a car 
wreck after burglarizing a 7-Eleven store in

22:31.398 --> 22:40.675
Brenham. Oh, wow. And they were, should they or 
should they not? As I recall, my response to them

22:45.525 --> 22:52.157
was to ask them a question, for whom do you hold 
silver taps? for Aggies. Was this an Aggie? Was he

22:56.843 --> 22:58.185
enrolled or not? He was enrolled. I said, all 
right, I leave it to your judgment. They held

23:03.231 --> 23:04.373
silver taps. Wow. Which I think was appropriate. 
Yeah, I do too. Who are we to judge? Exactly. Would I

23:09.739 --> 23:13.264
want them to have silver taps for me if I had gotten 
myself in a stupid situation like that? Yeah. All

23:14.505 --> 23:15.527
right. What was it like to go to your first Aggie 
home football game? as a student. Oh, my gosh, it

23:21.993 --> 23:24.276
was just absolutely amazing. Of course, hearing 
kids on campus talk about, you know, what football

23:24.316 --> 23:34.747
games were like, you know, seeing the excitement 
of the guys in the Corps, hearing the band

23:24.316 --> 23:34.747
practice.

23:37.811 --> 23:41.515
Really, the first Midnight Yale practice was just 
absolutely incredible. I don't really remember

23:42.336 --> 23:44.138
that much about it. I know I didn't have a date, but 
just, I was like, how could you get all these people

23:44.178 --> 23:50.325
together? at midnight on a Friday night. And even 
though kids, of course, back then the drinking age

23:53.255 --> 23:57.441
was 18. So, you know, everybody had been drinking 
and everybody had been partying and it was just

23:57.541 --> 24:02.547
absolutely wild. But it was just an amazing 
experience. It's kind of hard to describe. Up at

24:08.315 --> 24:09.917
the first football game, I was like, can I really 
stand up the whole game? But back in those days, we

24:13.197 --> 24:24.092
wore dresses and heels and hoes to football games 
and stood on those damn bleachers for three hours

24:13.197 --> 24:24.092
in the heat and just didn't think a thing about it. 
Now, was it socially okay for a young lady to go to a

24:24.477 --> 24:29.902
game without a date? Well, yeah, because there 
were enough of us back then that we weren't really

24:30.303 --> 24:36.609
alone. And it was less socially acceptable to not 
go to the game than it was to go without a date.

24:45.638 --> 24:49.422
Since you weren't in the Corps and all that, was 
there any kind of Corps... put-downs of you

24:49.587 --> 24:52.730
co-eds? No, they loved it. But it was the first year 
of W-1. So it was the very first year that women were

24:58.310 --> 25:00.172
in the Corps. And so there were a lot of negative 
attitudes directed towards them. Gosh, those

25:05.681 --> 25:07.383
women had such a hard time. I just am so amazed at 
their stick-to-itiveness and their stamina,

25:07.504 --> 25:13.893
having to endure what I know they must have 
endured. I didn't know any of them very well. As far

25:16.097 --> 25:19.182
as you recall, about how many were there in W-1? Oh, 
I'm thinking 20 or 30. That's what I thought. Yeah.

25:22.206 --> 25:22.867
Two dozen or so. Yeah. And hearing the guys in the 
Corps, very negative things. Did you give any

25:30.475 --> 25:33.719
thought to being in the Corps yourself? No, not for 
a minute. I didn't want any part of that. And so when

25:38.045 --> 25:49.242
you and your female, your co-ed colleagues, same 
class and so forth, you all didn't get anything

25:38.045 --> 25:49.242
said? You don't remember things said behind your 
back as you walked down the hallway or anything?

25:53.510 --> 25:54.572
All right. Did, let's see, Midnight Y'all 
Practices, oh, Bonfire. Bonfire. What did you and

25:59.098 --> 26:05.767
your co-ed friends, what did, did y'all do 
anything regarding Bonfire? Women didn't have

26:06.288 --> 26:08.691
anything to do with Bonfire back then. And it was on 
the Duncan? Yeah, yeah. We, you know, watched it go

26:12.317 --> 26:13.839
up. It was really a totally male activity. And we 
all thought they were kind of nuts, but we admired

26:18.721 --> 26:24.830
what they were doing and thought it was really 
cool. And just the, you know, and to me, a frosty

26:25.731 --> 26:33.723
clear November day will always be bonfire 
weather. Hearing the guys go, it's bonfire

26:34.303 --> 26:38.509
weather, and their excitement about that. And 
then... I don't even remember if I went to Bonfire

26:41.215 --> 26:44.062
my freshman year. I don't remember. Because I went 
home for Thanksgiving and maybe I did. Did you go to

26:53.002 --> 26:55.247
any out-of-town football games? Yes.

26:58.435 --> 26:59.477
Came home for I guess it was a rice game. Of course, 
you know, living a mile away from the campus, that

27:03.725 --> 27:11.256
was easy to come home for the weekend with a bunch of 
friends and go to the game. So at your house you had a

27:11.436 --> 27:14.140
number of guests that weekend? Yeah, yeah, and my 
poor parents had no idea what had hit them. How did

27:20.608 --> 27:24.013
you, during that first fall, how did you 
communicate with home? Letters or phone calls?

27:26.465 --> 27:29.429
Phone calls mostly, letters and phone calls. And 
mom and dad, dad would call every once in a while and

27:30.390 --> 27:37.359
mom would, mom didn't call much, but it was so 
expensive to make a lot of phone calls. And your

27:37.379 --> 27:39.102
cell phone didn't work very well then? No, it 
really didn't. Email wasn't running.

27:44.669 --> 27:52.920
How did you, as you're beginning academically, 
how did you feel about the way your progress that

27:44.669 --> 27:52.920
first semester academically? Were you doing 
pretty well? I didn't do as well as I... Of course,

27:54.002 --> 27:57.186
I'd never made... I made one B between eighth grade 
and my senior year in high school. And made a couple

28:01.092 --> 28:02.655
of Bs. And I may have even made a C on something that 
first semester because I played so much. And I

28:07.342 --> 28:09.805
remember that was kind of a very rude awakening. 
Because I knew that I had to keep my grades up if I

28:11.688 --> 28:15.694
wanted to get into medical school. And if I wanted 
to keep my scholarship, I had to have over... I

28:19.276 --> 28:22.240
think I had to have over a 3.0 to keep my president's 
scholarship. It may have been a 3.2. So it was a, you

28:24.003 --> 28:27.789
know, you had to keep it together. Who did you turn 
to for advice? Nobody. No, you didn't have? No. Let

28:34.919 --> 28:36.562
me turn back on. At

28:36.882 --> 28:47.799
the end of that first semester, you didn't do quite 
as well as you had hoped, and did that change

28:36.882 --> 28:47.799
anything in your... I started doubting... 
whether or not I could really get into medical

28:49.111 --> 28:50.913
school. And by the end of the second semester, when 
I really didn't do much better, I actually changed

28:51.974 --> 29:00.863
my major from pre-med to pre-pharmacy. I just 
thought, I'm not too sure I can cut this. And so

29:05.608 --> 29:14.798
then, so came back my sophomore year as a 
pre-pharmacy major, but worked at the allergy

29:15.402 --> 29:19.347
clinic where the allergist had been mentors to me 
as a summer job. Oh, very good. After your freshman

29:20.729 --> 29:22.150
year. Yes. Oh, splendid. And so worked there 
full-time. And those guys had known me since I was

29:25.735 --> 29:32.043
five years old because I had bad allergies and 
asthma as a child. And

29:32.083 --> 29:37.089
saw everything. Saw what the nurse... I never... 
toyed with nursing. I never wanted to do that, but I

29:40.794 --> 29:48.883
thought, well, med tech, pharmacy, something 
medically related, because I really liked the

29:40.794 --> 29:48.883
chemistry aspects of it. And they let me do 
everything. I did everything from filing charts

29:51.566 --> 29:58.494
to putting patients in the room until by the end of 
the summer, I knew how to give allergy shots and

29:51.566 --> 29:58.494
skin testing, and they taught me everything. It 
was just wonderful. And really, by the end of that

30:01.417 --> 30:06.823
sometime, At the end of that summer, sometime 
during my sophomore year, I realized, I like what

30:07.225 --> 30:12.290
the doctors do. That's what I want to do. I don't 
want to do what any of these other people do. So I got

30:16.634 --> 30:20.938
back on track again sometime, I believe, during my 
sophomore year. I was taking more of a traditional

30:22.219 --> 30:36.372
sophomore pre-med curriculum, regular organic 
chemistry, Shakespeare, to finish my English

30:22.219 --> 30:36.372
requirements. What else? I guess Chordate 
Anatomy is what sophomores took then. Classic old

30:41.222 --> 30:42.824
guy that taught Chordate. He taught Chordate 
forever. I don't remember his name, but he was

30:44.125 --> 30:46.327
amazing. The labs with those classes, probably, 
oh gosh, I don't remember what else I took. No, I

30:55.116 --> 30:57.098
took that during summer school. Did you have any 
teachers that really made an deep impression on

31:02.710 --> 31:05.156
you. No. Really? And it's, and I never, I was so damn 
independent and so stubborn and I think probably a

31:05.417 --> 31:14.158
little intimidated too. I never.
