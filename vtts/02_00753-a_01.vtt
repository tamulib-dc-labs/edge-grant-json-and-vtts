WEBVTT

00:02.039 --> 00:15.778
the

00:02.039 --> 00:15.778
question that occurred to me earlier but it was not 
an appropriate time to ask it but I'll ask it now you

00:02.039 --> 00:15.778
mentioned that connection with Dr. Hopkins. He 
had brought, he caused you to come from one place to

00:20.419 --> 00:26.486
another, and I've forgotten now where that was. I 
think maybe he pulled you down to the project at

00:26.586 --> 00:31.453
Grand Isle. Yes. You see, when Project 9 was set up, 
he was the director of the whole business. The

00:39.263 --> 00:42.707
Grand Isle area was not the only area we had. We had 
researches going on here, at Texas Christian

00:45.408 --> 00:57.868
University, at the University of Texas, in South 
Carolina at one of the laboratories, at LSU. Well,

00:57.928 --> 01:06.862
I think you mentioned that you and Dr. Hopkins had 
both studied under the same man at Illinois. Were

01:07.162 --> 01:08.464
you there at the same time? Yes. So you had known 
each other as graduates? Oh yes, I knew him up there

01:11.449 --> 01:13.272
quite well. And

01:13.606 --> 01:34.258
so we also, he

01:13.606 --> 01:34.258
came to the Virginia Fisher's Laboratory, 
College of William & Mary, just a few months after I

01:13.606 --> 01:34.258
took over that research job. So we worked together 
over there, you see, for a whole year. He was

01:38.445 --> 01:40.508
working mostly in the crustacean

01:40.876 --> 01:44.682
area. There's shrimp, blue crabs, and that area. I 
was working in the oyster research area, but we

01:49.629 --> 01:55.859
were together there also. We've never lost touch 
with each other since about 19 and well back in the

01:57.822 --> 02:04.993
20s here. Well, I thought that's probably what the 
connection was, but I want to clarify that.

02:17.062 --> 02:29.884
Other than the two big projects, 9 and 13, about 
which we have talked, what is some of your other

02:17.062 --> 02:29.884
significant research projects that you've been 
involved in?

02:33.914 --> 02:41.321
Well, my earliest research is, I deserted the, 
after getting my PhD.

02:43.723 --> 02:56.575
I had problems when I got to this college in 
Oklahoma, so far as the library was concerned, and

02:43.723 --> 02:56.575
I couldn't get together enough library to do 
research in the parasitology area. So I shifted to

02:56.595 --> 03:01.339
the freshwater crustacea, and Some of the best 
work was back there in the early days. With the

03:07.025 --> 03:26.672
freshwater crustacea, I studied cave fauna all 
over the United States, and described many

03:07.025 --> 03:26.672
species of freshwater crustaceans, and the 
isopods, amphipods, and these groups, studied

03:07.025 --> 03:26.672
plankton and things of this sort. This was the 
reason the University of Oklahoma hired me

03:30.108 --> 03:33.554
because they knew of my work in this area. They 
hired me for a completely different thing.

03:38.943 --> 03:44.132
From what I've been doing, I started with Dr. 
Jekyll and Mr. Hyde. There are two sets of people in

03:45.174 --> 03:48.099
the United States that know me. One of them knows me 
from my work in the crustacean and the freshwater

03:48.620 --> 03:53.989
biology area.

03:56.787 --> 04:00.432
The other knows me from my work in pollution. 
Completely separate.

04:06.281 --> 04:09.686
One of my students came in one day and said, Doc, I 
hear you're dead. What do you mean I'm dead? He

04:14.072 --> 04:25.168
said, well, I was at a meeting over here, and a guy 
from the University of Texas,

04:14.072 --> 04:25.168
and he was studying cave farming. He said, I told 
this that I was working under Dr. Mackin, and he

04:26.808 --> 04:47.896
said, oh no, Dr. Mackin is one of the old timers who 
worked in the first part of the century, and he's

04:26.808 --> 04:47.896
been dead a long time.

04:47.916 --> 04:49.979
So there are two sets of people. Now, one of the 
significant things that came out of it early in

04:49.999 --> 04:55.887
business Dr. Henry Baldwin Ward was also a 
freshwater biologist as well as a

04:56.660 --> 05:20.588
parasitologist, and he edited the first edition 
of Ward and Whipple's Freshwater Biology, which

04:56.660 --> 05:20.588
is a classic, in the taxonomy of the freshwater 
forms in the United States. That one came out in

05:21.269 --> 05:23.832
1918. It was one of my Bibles before I ever saw Henry 
B. Ward. Then,

05:32.059 --> 05:41.089
and it helped to take me to the University of 
Illinois. I liked that area as well as

05:41.469 --> 05:44.873
Christology.

05:46.275 --> 05:55.084
Later on, after Dr. Ward's death, this volume was 
completely revised and re- issued somewhere in

05:55.418 --> 06:25.122
the early 60s after I was here and I authored one of 
the chapters in the book and the crustacean area

05:55.418 --> 06:25.122
and it is studied with my species that I've 
described so I'm sort of proud of that book and that

05:55.418 --> 06:25.122
volume which I helped put together because it is an 
aggregation of people who are the tops in their

05:55.418 --> 06:25.122
line in that freshwater biology area In

06:25.743 --> 06:43.241
fact, I like that work just as well as I do the rest of

06:25.743 --> 06:43.241
it. There is a peculiar phase of my work at the 
present time, and it grew as I developed. much of

06:55.662 --> 07:00.807
the work that I did for the oil companies I did 
through their legal departments. Sometimes it

07:02.048 --> 07:04.511
wasn't, but sometimes it was. Sometimes lawsuits 
came up and I began to develop the knowledge of

07:05.191 --> 07:18.905
legal affairs.

07:21.388 --> 07:23.830
And much of my work now has to do with the legal 
aspects of oil pollution, and in some cases have

07:24.991 --> 07:39.523
been hired directly to advise attorneys in the 
matter of oil pollution, what it does, what it does

07:40.752 --> 07:51.969
not do, and analyses or reports, things of this 
sort. This probably shouldn't be in this main

07:51.989 --> 07:56.095
part. It is a complete sideline. But it's been a 
great advantage to me because I get to know a

07:59.360 --> 08:05.950
profession. which is completely different, 
differently oriented from the scientists and

08:06.301 --> 08:29.269
academic scientists, people who have never been 
in the academic area at all, and they're totally

08:06.301 --> 08:29.269
engrossed in the adversary type of litigation, 
all of it civil litigation, of course.

08:30.671 --> 08:35.937
This...

08:30.671 --> 08:35.937
After I retired, This part of the thing almost took 
over, or did in a number of cases. I have three cases

08:42.517 --> 08:50.398
coming up in the next two months,

08:51.644 --> 08:53.607
I've just finished one. Now, some of the most 
interesting work I have done since I retired has

08:53.987 --> 09:03.060
been in the oil spill area. This took over with 
first the Torrey Canyon and then the Santa Barbara

09:03.080 --> 09:15.137
spills, and this is something I had been doing for a 
quarter of a century. but nobody paid any

09:15.758 --> 09:17.840
attention. I even wrote papers on it, published 
them, but nobody ever paid any attention to them

09:17.880 --> 09:26.369
because oil spills were common. But after these 
two big spills, the whole nation became oil

09:27.690 --> 09:38.240
conscious and spill conscious. So I have picked up 
a number of

09:43.197 --> 09:45.699
studies, worked out a number of studies. The chief 
one of these was the Chevron OS bill, where we spent

09:45.759 --> 09:56.770
more money probably than we did in Project 9. This 
study is completed and there were enormous

09:58.051 --> 10:09.462
amounts of money tied up in it, 130 some odd million 
in suits originally. These were all settled out of

10:10.423 --> 10:12.225
court. They were settled, not out of court, but in 
favor of Shervin. Shervin got the decisions

10:21.007 --> 10:26.655
completely in there. I did two of these for 
Shervin, the big one and then there was a little one

10:26.675 --> 10:38.912
along the side that I was carrying that nobody ever 
heard of, but me and the rest of them. This was a big

10:38.992 --> 10:39.833
one. We have now, we're getting ready to publish 
these data. I have a copy now in there for review.

10:48.919 --> 10:52.183
Another big spill was the Tampa spill. There was 
one in Tampa Bay and I worked for Exxon on that one

10:52.203 --> 11:06.640
and spent a good part of the year on that and trained 
two or three good graduate students on it. Then the

11:06.700 --> 11:12.807
last one, which is just now being settled, was in 
Maine, in Casco Bay. This is the city of Portland.

11:22.819 --> 11:32.411
And this one has been finished, and the report has 
been written,

11:22.819 --> 11:32.411
but not distributed. This one also will be 
published pretty soon, I'm sure. This one will be

11:36.377 --> 11:38.800
settled out of court. What exactly is your role in 
these investigations? Now, all of these

11:44.917 --> 11:47.981
investigations will go about it about like this. 
The first part of it is simply a matter of

11:48.441 --> 11:57.052
determining what damage is done by the oil spill. 
When I know what damage is done in the oil spill,

11:57.092 --> 12:05.383
then I can tell these people what I think they're 
liable to. For example, in the one in Casco Bay, a

12:05.463 --> 12:12.612
great lot of oil got in the under tidal zone, and it 
did considerable damage. especially in one

12:13.115 --> 12:20.784
thickly populated island, a rocky island there. 
So, when we get to this point, we then give them what

12:20.804 --> 12:28.914
we think is an assessment of damage. We, of course, 
always have some parcels, and it would be

12:28.934 --> 12:35.142
important.

12:35.162 --> 12:42.210
After that, I'm usually asked to

12:43.793 --> 12:50.259
to help develop the legal end of it, the defense 
there is to be. In the case of the Shervin's bill,

12:52.642 --> 13:08.718
both Shervin's bills, and this Castle Bay's bill, 
there will be no court proceedings, I'm sure,

12:52.642 --> 13:08.718
because the settlement is made in the one case 
against Shervin. Shervin won the case outright

13:08.738 --> 13:13.783
without going to court, without any concession. 
In the other case, they did make concessions, but

13:14.422 --> 13:28.481
the federal government is going to have to take the 
rap through a purely coincidental avenue. Their

13:30.083 --> 13:42.420
Coast Guard moved some buoys without giving the 
proper notice, and this boat hit the rocks because

13:30.083 --> 13:42.420
of the damn buoys

13:30.083 --> 13:42.420
it went through. over a year to establish that. I 
mean, the lawyers were working on it. Finally,

13:49.271 --> 13:50.793
they did get it established. Of course, the case 
collapsed at that point, but we were prepared in

13:50.833 --> 14:00.122
that case for a settlement. We had got it down to 
about two or three million dollars, which I

14:00.142 --> 14:10.011
thought was reasonable for this intertidal zone 
damage, which was extensive in a very highly

14:10.666 --> 14:23.164
populated area, all of which scores with very 
valuable property all the way around. So it's

14:23.184 --> 14:29.353
probably your principal function then is an 
assessment of the damage done by this bill. That's

14:29.573 --> 14:30.094
right. This is the first thing we do, and we never 
let anything get in our way until we've made up our

14:30.214 --> 14:37.264
minds. what that is. Then when we get through that, 
we'll help them with the legal force of time, if

14:39.286 --> 14:45.253
they want it. How do you go about assessing the 
damage? Do you test the water, the content of the

14:49.818 --> 14:52.501
oil in it? Oh, we have very complicated methods. We 
measure the oil content everywhere. We use the gas

15:02.236 --> 15:14.756
chromatographic method and untied pretty 
closely in this to a New Orleans firm,

15:02.236 --> 15:14.756
a biologically oriented firm. We have an 
excellent chemist and all of the equipment. So we

15:20.205 --> 15:28.058
measure the oil content everywhere that it seems 
reasonable to do so. And we measure the biological

15:29.658 --> 15:43.019
communities

15:29.658 --> 15:43.019
in the intertidal zone and in the bottom plankton 
and everything else. And we have methods even

15:43.720 --> 15:53.556
running into mathematical analyses which will 
measure the damage done. To go into these, beyond

15:54.886 --> 15:59.254
this, would be almost impossible. In fact, I'd be 
sitting here next week. I went into all of it.

16:04.703 --> 16:15.021
That's the gist of what we do.

16:16.013 --> 16:31.468
You don't get into the tremendous efforts that 
have been made to contain the oil once it's spilled

16:16.013 --> 16:31.468
or to avoid spills and that sort of thing. Well, I 
get into that a little bit. You mean the

16:34.091 --> 16:37.034
containment of the spill.

16:38.996 --> 16:42.760
I have some strong ideas on that, but I'm not an 
engineer. This really belongs to the engineers.

16:45.730 --> 17:03.405
and I pretty well let them have it when I can, but I do 
have some strong ideas on it, and I also have some

16:45.730 --> 17:03.405
real good studies on the detergents which are used 
in cleanup and things of this sort. These always

17:03.425 --> 17:08.194
play a part in all of the studies. detergents and 
cleanup of the spill, not cleaning the inside of

17:09.355 --> 17:14.443
the tank or something? Well, take, for example, 
the Shervin spill. When they were trying to put

17:18.970 --> 17:35.194
that fire out, that big platform caught on fire and 
burned for weeks, and then when they were working

17:18.970 --> 17:35.194
on the thing, trying to cap these wells, about 
seven or eight of them on one platform, They use

17:35.883 --> 17:44.070
detergents to keep the oil washed off the thing 
because it's a fire hazard to the firefighters.

17:44.350 --> 17:47.533
This is Red Adair's group working on it. They use 
these detergents and these detergents are pretty

17:48.234 --> 17:52.697
highly toxic. Ten times more than oil is. Oil is 
only very slightly toxic. But these detergents

17:59.503 --> 18:04.928
and some of the other chemicals that they use are 
highly toxic. toxic we believe that there was

18:05.380 --> 18:31.472
actually some damage under the platform by these 
detergents in the case of this spill over there

18:05.380 --> 18:31.472
although we can't actually be sure of it the data do 
show it this is as far as we went was confined to the

18:05.380 --> 18:31.472
center field of the platform and didn't get 
anywhere else and so all kinds of collateral

18:05.380 --> 18:31.472
problems of this My idea is that what they should do 
in a spill at sea is to use a suction dredge and sink

18:32.347 --> 18:45.965
all of that oil with silt onto the bottom. And the 
reason for that is that we have never found

18:45.985 --> 18:59.063
anywhere in the world where the bottom fauna in an 
offshore situation has ever been damaged, no

18:45.985 --> 18:59.063
matter how much oil gets down. We found a lot of oil 
from Chevron was incorporated in the mud in the

19:00.157 --> 19:08.450
bottom, but there was no damage there. There are 
technical reasons for that, bearing upon the

19:08.470 --> 19:25.776
solubility of various fractions of oil and on the 
volatility of various fractions of oil,

19:08.470 --> 19:25.776
things of this sort. and the toxic fractions are 
the ones which are most soluble and

19:28.523 --> 19:43.019
which will evaporate, like benzene, xylene, and 
these fractions. They are lost into the

19:44.620 --> 19:52.709
atmosphere very rapidly.

19:52.749 --> 19:54.952
24 hours is usually sufficient. In other words, 
when the oil gets on the water, you lose

19:57.886 --> 20:02.072
practically all of the toxic fractions. It's only 
when this oil goes into the intertidal zone where

20:02.092 --> 20:17.031
it does real damage, and depending upon where you 
are and what you do about that intertidal zone and

20:02.092 --> 20:17.031
how you clean it up, damage may be extensive. This 
was true in the Torrey Canyon spill where they used

20:17.051 --> 20:26.003
highly toxic

20:30.134 --> 20:43.951
surfactants to clean the beach, as well as other 
methods of cleaning, like bulldozing and things

20:30.134 --> 20:43.951
of this sort. So, you have to take all of these 
things into consideration.

20:50.059 --> 20:58.690
All of the

20:50.059 --> 20:58.690
methods depend upon where you are, what kind of, 
how close to The land, the spill is, all of these

20:59.480 --> 21:07.960
things play a part in

20:59.480 --> 21:07.960
it. I shouldn't have got off on that, but a good part 
of my work recently has been on that area.
