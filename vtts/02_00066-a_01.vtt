WEBVTT

00:03.170 --> 00:05.633
This is May 19, I believe. I have the pleasure of 
being at 1212 Orr Street, getting ready to chat

00:06.415 --> 00:12.443
with Mary Eccles. Ms. Eccles, would you say a 
sentence or two, and let's see if your machine is

00:13.084 --> 00:17.711
picking up. Well, I will. I wanted to start out when 
my father came in August of 2009. All right. Are you

00:27.807 --> 00:29.149
interested in that? Oh, yes, yes. Tell, first of 
all, tell me about his background. Where did he

00:35.136 --> 00:37.198
grow up and where did he? Well, he grew up in 
Mississippi and he was at the University of, when

00:37.418 --> 00:49.933
he was at

00:37.418 --> 00:49.933
Mississippi A&M, he graduated and taught there. 
And he came here in August of 09. He came to me in the

00:56.046 --> 01:01.678
physics department. which he was never in. When he 
got here, they were organizing for the first time

01:03.830 --> 01:12.761
the electrical engineering department, which he 
took over and kept. Had he majored in electrical

01:13.062 --> 01:15.645
engineering? Yes. How did he get recruited? Who 
contacted him? I have no idea about that. How did he

01:25.317 --> 01:26.038
come? On the train, I presume. Oh, yeah, on the 
train. And my mother was crippled. And I don't know

01:32.924 --> 01:35.992
how she managed, but she did. Because they had to 
walk up from the station down there to the houses.

01:45.466 --> 01:48.431
And they had a house. It was Throckmorton, but it 
really was quality rose, what they always called

01:48.451 --> 01:53.699
it. What did they bring with them in the way of 
furniture or belongings? I don't have any idea,

01:57.284 --> 01:59.948
but not a lot. And my mother had taught in the little 
school on the campus at Mississippi A&M. What did

02:11.747 --> 02:12.688
she teach? The beginners. Oh, elementary school? 
Yeah, yeah. And were there any children at that

02:19.056 --> 02:21.440
point? No, and I came in January. They came in 
August, and I arrived in January. Where were you?

02:31.157 --> 02:32.159
Were you born at home? At home. The doctor razor 
came out from Brian Ray horse and buggy razor raise

02:33.307 --> 02:39.940
RAZOR.

02:42.464 --> 02:47.935
And so you you were born in the house on the campus, 
yeah.

02:54.567 --> 02:55.990
Who was the president then? You know, I've been 
thinking all morning about that, and I'm not sure.

03:02.360 --> 03:08.048
I think that it was

03:02.360 --> 03:08.048
Milner.

03:11.394 --> 03:15.960
Do you have any idea what your father's first 
salary was? No. But it wasn't very much. None of

03:20.728 --> 03:22.651
them were very much. How long did they live in that 
house? Well, they lived in that house. until 1918,

03:27.205 --> 03:33.155
and then they moved two houses up the street. 
Describe that first house as you remember it.

03:39.525 --> 03:45.755
Well, you know, it was just, it was just, it was 
home, and just a house. How big was it? Bedrooms? We

03:49.201 --> 03:53.668
had about three or four bedrooms. And to every 
house on campus, there was a maid's quarters. They

04:00.319 --> 04:02.742
had maid's quarters. Did y'all have a full-time 
maid? Yep, we did. And did she have a family or was

04:10.029 --> 04:13.392
she by herself? She was by herself.

04:18.997 --> 04:21.580
Describe the, how many, How many faculty houses 
were there? Do you remember? How big was the

04:26.417 --> 04:28.399
neighborhood of faculty? Well, on our street, 
they were, all the houses that were there except,

04:28.700 --> 04:50.503
they built one for later on when the,

04:28.700 --> 04:50.503
I'll tell you in a minute.

04:52.407 --> 04:53.648
Dr. Thomas came. They built him a house in there in 
between our old house. By then we had moved up the

04:59.134 --> 05:05.240
street between our house and the one next to it. I 
forgot who lived down below us, our house. And then

05:10.245 --> 05:21.756
the Youngbloods, he was head of the

05:27.119 --> 05:34.566
Well,

05:27.119 --> 05:34.566
isn't that awful? We'll get it later. Yeah, yeah. 
Describe your neighbors. Well, that was them, and

05:39.651 --> 05:45.377
then on the other side of us was Dr. Fraps, who was a 
state chemist. Frap, F-R-A-P? F-R-A-P-S, Fraps.

05:51.002 --> 05:51.162
Mm-hmm. And... Dr. Ball lived right across the 
street from us. B-A-L-L, Ball. He was biology.

06:05.570 --> 06:09.373
And next to him was Dean Pereira. And as you know, 
Dean Pereira was the only one who owned his own

06:09.894 --> 06:13.237
home. It was on campus, but it was his with the 
understanding, of course, that when he gave it up,

06:19.972 --> 06:23.017
it went over to the university. Was that 
P-U-R-Y-E-A-R? P-U-R-Y-E-A-R. He was the dean of

06:28.026 --> 06:34.376
the college.

06:35.118 --> 06:37.642
Do you remember him by personality? Definitely. 
He was an old bachelor. And he always weighed us. He

06:43.800 --> 06:48.085
walked with a cane, and when we were real little, we 
were allowed to be picked. You know, he'd pick us up

06:48.165 --> 06:51.048
on his cane and weighed us. And who were some of your 
playmates as you were a youngster? Okay. All

06:58.096 --> 06:58.337
right. Mary Frapps, who lived on the other side. 
She was a little bit older, but she was there. And

07:05.284 --> 07:10.330
Virginia Burns and Julia Ball, who lived across 
the street. And then later, when the Waltons moved

07:11.069 --> 07:20.919
out on campus, they moved into the house that we 
originally lived in. And they and Ethel and I were

07:21.559 --> 07:25.443
very close friends. Describe Mr. Walton. Well,

07:30.908 --> 07:39.777
you know, it's hard for me to do that because he was 
so special. We just grew up, you know, and I spent as

07:39.976 --> 07:49.209
much time in their house as I did in my own home, and 
it was just my second home. What made him special?

07:53.956 --> 07:56.960
Well, just because he was there, I guess. Did he 
have presents for little girls? Oh, no, nothing

08:00.084 --> 08:01.787
like that. No, nothing like that. No, he had... 
four children of his own. What did he like to do? Did

08:08.833 --> 08:12.200
he have any hobbies or things? Not that I can 
remember. We bought our milk from them. They had a

08:15.767 --> 08:19.855
cow and we got our milk from them. And so they had a 
cow on the campus and it was milked. Oh yeah, oh

08:23.397 --> 08:23.838
yeah. I think we had one originally because that 
wasn't good enough for me, anything wasn't good

08:24.198 --> 08:32.409
enough for me because I was that first little girl. 
Where did y'all buy groceries?

08:39.859 --> 08:40.640
They ordered them. Each morning you called in to 
Brian to Mr. I don't know what his name was in a

08:47.290 --> 09:01.406
minute, and ordered what you had to have for the 
day, and he brought it out in the afternoon,

08:47.290 --> 09:01.406
delivered it. In a truck? Well, a horse-drawn 
truck. Oh, a wagon. Yeah, yeah. And was there any

09:09.715 --> 09:16.723
place out here near the college to buy groceries? 
No place. It was years and years before there was

09:20.145 --> 09:25.711
any place.

09:26.893 --> 09:28.835
Go back as far as your memory can. Describe what was 
on the campus. What buildings were here? The main

09:35.402 --> 09:40.207
building, which burned after, you know, and then 
was rebuilt. All right. It was here when you came,

09:40.768 --> 09:44.311
the main building that burned. Also, as far as I 
know, the the electrical engineering and the

09:46.032 --> 09:59.694
civil engineering buildings and there were 
dormitories and they went up that main drag just

09:46.032 --> 09:59.694
like they always did. Was Sully's statue there? Oh 
no, that came later. Do you remember when the main

10:04.963 --> 10:08.108
building burned? I was real small then, and I know 
it burned, but I... You don't remember seeing it or

10:08.847 --> 10:14.636
anything? But when the floods came and when the 
river, Brazos River got out and washed everything

10:14.936 --> 10:35.306
away, we'd go up into the top floor, or up, I guess, 
on the roof of the administration

10:14.936 --> 10:35.306
building, and we could see what was going on over 
there. Out to the west. Yeah, yeah. Do you remember

10:38.210 --> 10:41.114
when the main building was built? Do you remember 
watching that happen? No. Where did you and your

10:45.880 --> 10:49.765
friends, where did y'all play? In our yards. And we 
always, at night, everybody got out and played

10:51.968 --> 10:58.817
until dark. Just in the neighborhood. Did the 
students ever come over to the faculty area? No,

11:10.706 --> 11:13.873
except that they worked over there. My father 
always had them in the yard. That was his way of

11:20.161 --> 11:23.105
helping him get an education. He paid him to do the 
yard work. Doing yard work. Yeah, yeah. And in old

11:29.033 --> 11:34.040
school, we had to go to Bryan to school. How did you 
get to Bryan? Well, we walked down to Speza Hall and

11:36.403 --> 11:46.737
got on a streetcar, and sometimes we got there and 
sometimes we didn't, but then that's the way we

11:36.403 --> 11:46.737
went. And that was until 1920. Where, what school 
in Bryan, where was the building? Do you remember?

11:55.428 --> 11:57.730
Yeah, it was out this way. It's still there, but 
it's changed a number of times, different names,

11:57.850 --> 12:09.862
so I don't have, but it was close to, well, Texas 
Avenue. It was about three or four blocks from

12:10.603 --> 12:13.666
there. You walk. Was it that old elementary school 
over by the old St. Joseph Hospital? over toward

12:22.025 --> 12:23.708
where the Astons lived? It was in there someplace, 
yeah. Do you remember who the teachers were, any of

12:27.173 --> 12:29.337
your? Well, I used to, but I didn't stop. Mother 
taught me until I was in the third grade, so I didn't

12:34.005 --> 12:39.273
have to go as soon as some of them did. When you did 
go, about how many students went to school in Bryan

12:40.335 --> 12:46.465
from the college? All of us. But I mean we all just 
walked, the whole gang of us just walked to get on

12:47.776 --> 12:55.030
the streetcar and we rode in there. And if an order 
came and we didn't have clothes enough, some one of

12:55.511 --> 13:07.995
the mothers, by then there were some cars on the 
camp, a few cars, and they would bring in our

13:09.241 --> 13:10.603
jackets in for us. Would you all fill up a streetcar 
when all the kids were on it? Oh, I think so. And so

13:16.031 --> 13:18.074
you went to school there. Because it was all the way 
through high school. You went to school there

13:22.700 --> 13:24.383
until 1920? 1920.

13:27.627 --> 13:30.051
Let's back up. How did World War I affect the 
campus? Do you remember? Yes. My father had charge

13:35.579 --> 13:37.341
of the the program for the the students that were i 
mean the the soldiers that were there it was were

13:37.675 --> 14:03.447
under him and he worked with the uh well fort sam 
who's and i remember the thing that impressed me as

13:37.675 --> 14:03.447
a little girl was that we had a a special telephone 
that of course we couldn't use but it went direct to

13:37.675 --> 14:03.447
the to the military

14:04.253 --> 14:10.842
Now, were the students that he was helping, were 
these all A&M students, or had some young men been

14:04.253 --> 14:10.842
brought? Oh, these were soldiers that were put 
there by the Army during World War I, just like they

14:10.962 --> 14:20.095
did during World War II. And what was he teaching 
them? Well, he didn't teach them. He was just over

14:25.843 --> 14:27.485
the whole program. Oh, I see. Yeah. I'm sure they 
had their own teachers because it was a military

14:30.916 --> 14:40.435
thing, but they were just stationed there during 
the war. Now how close was it from your house to the

14:40.455 --> 14:48.471
dormitories where the students lived, the A&M 
students? Well, it was about two blocks. And when

14:51.857 --> 14:53.160
you all referred If someone asked you where you 
lived, did you all say we live at college? What did

15:00.520 --> 15:02.142
you call this community? It was always College 
Station. I don't know. Or A&M Campus. No, it was A&M

15:07.970 --> 15:11.474
Campus. And

15:11.494 --> 15:19.564
when the war was over, did a bunch of veterans come 
back to school? I don't know. I expect they did.

15:22.590 --> 15:26.257
They did it after World War II, but I think they 
probably did. Right. So you were in Bryan until

15:26.959 --> 15:30.505
1920. I was never in Bryan. I mean, went to school. 
Then you came back and went to school on the campus?

15:37.017 --> 15:39.482
The school was across the street from our house. On 
the campus. On the campus. Please describe the

15:42.476 --> 15:45.100
building as much as you can. Well, it was a nice size 
building, a two-story building, and all of the

15:45.140 --> 15:50.389
school was there. And the house, the Ball's house, 
they were these old houses. They may be, you

15:59.843 --> 16:04.170
probably don't know about them, but then, I mean, 
they were the original buildings. houses for the

16:04.673 --> 16:07.985
original university. And they were across the 
street from us. There were one, two, three, I think

16:10.655 --> 16:15.713
there were four or five. And anyway, there were two 
stories. And one of them, they made it into the

16:19.212 --> 16:24.959
teacherage, the one that was closest to the thing. 
But also,

16:24.979 --> 16:32.186
some of our courses were taught by Indian 
professors. Do you remember some of those

16:33.187 --> 16:35.810
teachers? Well, I can't give you their names now. 
But we took physics and chemistry and things like

16:39.374 --> 16:44.299
that University professors. And you graduated 
what year? I graduated early and I graduated in

16:49.935 --> 16:52.660
1926. 26.

16:56.887 --> 16:59.030
About how many were in your graduation class? Oh, 
about, I graduated a year ahead. There were about

17:03.617 --> 17:06.582
seven or eight of us. What did y'all call the name of 
the school? consolidated. It was already

17:12.488 --> 17:20.301
consolidated because they brought them all in 
from all the neighboring areas. What did did the

17:21.383 --> 17:26.191
what did y'all call the kids that lived out in the 
country? I'm sure we were nice about it but they

17:27.693 --> 17:35.025
with our home economics we would make money the 
time or two we'd sell peanut brittle and I can

17:35.208 --> 17:49.325
remember to this day how horrible it was because 
they got on their buses and went home at four

17:35.208 --> 17:49.325
o'clock and we had to wash all those. All those 
peanuts? Those pans and they were horrible. And as

17:56.914 --> 18:01.039
you were in high school, who were your closest 
friends? Ethel. Walton and Mary Frapps and Julia

18:03.760 --> 18:09.127
Ball. We were all, you know, right there in the 
neighborhood. When you were in high school, was it

18:14.234 --> 18:22.105
acceptable to have a date with an Aggie student? In 
fact, I went to some of the dances when I was 12

18:22.125 --> 18:29.515
because they needed girls so badly. Please 
describe those dances. What were they like? Where

18:32.351 --> 18:33.153
were they held? Well, they were held in Speza Hall. 
And the

18:37.178 --> 18:43.286
faculty wives chaperoned. They were all there and 
chaperoned them. And when I got into college and

18:47.091 --> 18:55.823
came home, then at midnight, Of course, there's no 
place to go to get a bite to eat or anything, so we

18:56.005 --> 19:02.317
always went to our houses. They took turns. One 
would have it one time, and we'd walk down,

19:05.102 --> 19:15.542
military walking, to the house and have our 
refreshments and then go back to the dance. Now,

19:16.324 --> 19:18.047
Guyon Hall was there. Well, it wasn't in the 
beginning, but it was later. Okay, so that Sabisa

19:22.034 --> 19:32.866
was at the other end, and the academic building was 
there by the time you were in high school. It had

19:34.748 --> 19:35.749
been rebuilt. Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah. At a dance at 
Sabisa, what did you young ladies wear? Oh, long

19:48.335 --> 19:49.436
dresses. And for the RVs, ballroom things, we had 
to have four. Because they were Thursday night,

19:55.042 --> 19:59.266
Friday night, and Saturday night. Which one? That 
was for the RVs. Which dance was most important?

20:08.936 --> 20:11.239
Well, the RVs had theirs in the spring. Then there 
was a big one at Thanksgiving and a big final ball.

20:15.318 --> 20:21.886
But they were, also we had dances on the weekends. 
And did, there was no problem about dancing? No

20:27.133 --> 20:28.895
Baptist complained about? Well, if they didn't, 
we didn't hear them. But we didn't have any,

20:33.721 --> 20:41.971
there weren't any churches on campus at all then. 
And I mean, I think there was two or three years

20:44.866 --> 20:59.109
where every Sunday my father would go out and talk 
to different people to find out what kind of, what

20:44.866 --> 20:59.109
they wanted, what denomination they wanted, and 
they finally got theirs. But otherwise, they

20:59.149 --> 21:08.865
marched them all in on Sunday, you know, they 
marched the whole corps into the, finally it was to

20:59.149 --> 21:08.865
the, God Hall, but before that it was next door. It 
was on the road there with the dormitories. And

21:15.558 --> 21:18.542
there would be a worship service? There was a 
worship service and some prominent minister

21:18.682 --> 21:29.757
from, it didn't make any what denomination, it was 
a different one every time, but they had a

21:18.682 --> 21:29.757
different one every Sunday. Did you and your 
parents go to church during those years? Yes.

21:34.486 --> 21:35.507
Where did you all worship? Well, we went in, Brian, 
to the Presbyterian Church. We'd drive in on

21:40.435 --> 21:42.118
Sunday. And it was down there by the railroad? 
Yeah. Were your parents Presbyterians before

21:47.686 --> 21:50.190
they came? Yes.

21:54.296 --> 21:57.761
Were there other Presbyterians on the campus? 
What other families? No, there were a lot. Later on

22:02.948 --> 22:10.761
there were the Frank Andersons and

22:02.948 --> 22:10.761
the Wilcoxes. He was the principal and then the 
superintendent of the school when we got our high

22:10.782 --> 22:17.072
school. There were quite a few. Let's see. Back on 
the campus, the classes were held from Monday

22:24.982 --> 22:38.622
morning till Saturday at noon. But you youngsters 
went to school just Monday through Friday. That's

22:44.150 --> 22:46.514
right. And who were some of the teachers in the high 
school that you remember? Were there some special

22:53.673 --> 22:56.136
people that were really good? Yes, but they came 
and went, and not anybody that was here

22:56.797 --> 23:03.626
permanently.

23:05.068 --> 23:08.613
So there weren't many of them that were wives of 
faculty members? None, really. In the beginning,

23:09.955 --> 23:16.283
I think finally that happened a little bit later 
on, but they were. Let's go back to the dances. How

23:19.147 --> 23:21.570
did the people behave at the dances? They behaved 
fine. We had programs and we knew who we would go to

23:23.530 --> 23:34.531
dance with and you went to a certain place after the 
dance and then you got your next person that was on

23:23.530 --> 23:34.531
your program. How did you put the names on your 
program? There was a pencil hanging on your dance

23:39.353 --> 23:45.241
program. Okay. And so they filled out the program 
that night? Yeah, that night people would come up

23:51.428 --> 23:54.813
and ask if they could have a dance. And, of course, 
you were very popular because there weren't many

23:55.554 --> 24:00.420
girls there. All right, so there were girls from 
the campus. Were there girls from Bryan? Oh,

24:05.166 --> 24:06.728
always, always. but not many from the campus 
because there weren't that many of us at that age

24:06.877 --> 24:14.372
group, but always from Bryan. And then for the big 
dances, the families on campus took care of the

24:14.552 --> 24:26.256
student girls, but they'd come and stay with you. 
We always had girls staying with us. What did the

24:28.848 --> 24:30.890
families charge for that? Oh, no, no. Normally, 
what dance would have the largest out-of-town

24:34.455 --> 24:39.621
crowd? I guess maybe the RVs because they came and 
stayed three days. Did girls come down from CIA?

24:50.214 --> 24:52.577
Oh, yes, a lot of them from CIA. Now I've heard about 
boys writing letters to girls with the same post

24:54.380 --> 25:04.254
office box number for a blind date. That didn't 
happen way back there? If it did, I didn't know it.

25:09.021 --> 25:10.904
It probably did, though. It did. uh my mind recalls 
that dr bezell came here as president yes in 1915.

25:13.060 --> 25:38.848
yes please share anything you remember about the 
bezells well uh elaine the daughter was was uh well

25:13.060 --> 25:38.848
i think she was in high school and now i see i wasn't 
but five years old then so uh but but she We looked up

25:39.284 --> 25:46.215
to her, and Dr. Brazil was very highly thought of. I 
interviewed her about a year ago, and she was

25:46.616 --> 25:51.684
marvelous. She lives in Oklahoma City. Was she a 
pleasant young lady? Oh, yes. How often did you and

26:02.121 --> 26:06.388
your family go to the president's house in those 
days? I don't remember at all. I mean, I didn't go at

26:08.907 --> 26:12.974
all because... Describe Dr. Bezell physically. 
What did he look like? Well, he was a big, heavy-set

26:16.681 --> 26:21.250
man, like most of them were back in those days. And

26:21.390 --> 26:26.540
she said he didn't believe in drinking. Oh, no, no. 
They were Baptists. That's right. Very definite

26:30.613 --> 26:33.216
Baptists. And from Navasota.

26:38.844 --> 26:44.552
On drinking, where did the students, if they 
wanted to get something to drink, where did they

26:38.844 --> 26:44.552
get it? They didn't get it. They weren't supposed 
to drink and they didn't get it. And my father was

26:47.597 --> 26:50.120
very opposed to it. We never had a... We finally... 
Well, I had something and I almost died in the... A

26:57.871 --> 27:03.678
neighbor across the street brought over a little 
whiskey and kept me alive until the doctor got

26:57.871 --> 27:03.678
there. After that, we had a little bottle that we 
kept in the old cedar chest. But that same little

27:12.148 --> 27:18.877
bottle was there for many, many years.

27:19.097 --> 27:27.287
After a dance, if a group of students and their 
dates wanted to have a big time, where did they go?

27:28.550 --> 27:30.293
Well, they had to go back to a house. Okay. 
Somebody's house because people just don't

27:31.495 --> 27:35.362
realize there was nothing. There was just 
nothing. What was there at Northgate or Southgate

27:37.545 --> 27:44.237
when you were in high school? Was there anything? 
Well, in high school, what's his name? I know you

27:50.488 --> 27:52.431
know who I'm going to talk about it. funny little 
old man, and he had a house up there. Can't think of

27:56.896 --> 27:58.199
what his name was. He was a bachelor, and he 
entertained the high school kids, and he was

27:58.459 --> 28:05.650
writing an opera. Writing an opera? He was writing 
an opera, yeah. But he had several pianos, and we'd

28:10.959 --> 28:14.064
go. He'd entertain us, and we'd go up to his house, 
but There was just really, there was nothing. I

28:24.120 --> 28:27.525
mean, there was no place to stay. And the people, 
look at me in the heart, but when I say that the

28:27.545 --> 28:40.784
people used our bathroom, because, you know, 
there was no place for women to go to the bathroom or

28:27.545 --> 28:40.784
anything. It was just, it was a boys' school. And we 
was there close by where they could stop by on the

28:43.629 --> 28:49.317
way to the ball game. Was it acceptable for you as a 
young girl to walk down the hallway of the A&M

28:49.634 --> 28:58.023
buildings? Or did your family tell you to stay out 
of those buildings? Oh, no. I mean, there wasn't

29:03.790 --> 29:05.292
any reason to go. And when they built a new 
building, we were always there to serve the punch

29:06.493 --> 29:16.384
and to do the things like that. Let's see. Describe 
the Andersons. Frank. Yes, ma'am. Well, they

29:23.147 --> 29:24.989
lived behind us. And

29:25.950 --> 29:34.901
Frank Anderson also came from Mississippi, so he 
and my father had, you know, things in common.

29:36.242 --> 29:36.943
Describe him. What was he like? He was a very fine 
person. Bigs? No, he wasn't big. He wasn't a big

29:46.047 --> 29:49.732
man, but he was a good coach. Now, he was one of the 
coaches and later would be a part of the

29:49.972 --> 29:56.021
commandant. What about Coach D.X. Bible? 
Describe him. Well, he was a coach and a good one,

30:00.547 --> 30:06.375
and he was at my wedding. Really? Yeah, yeah. He was 
at my wedding. Let's see. Did you by chance know a

30:11.121 --> 30:14.967
football player named Heine Weir? No. The name I 
do, but I didn't know him. I ask because in 1959, I

30:19.509 --> 30:27.519
taught at Schreiner College in Kerrville, and he 
was then the dean. Oh, no. Then I later learned that

30:29.201 --> 30:39.273
he was the player who had the hurt leg that King Gill 
would have replaced as the 12th man. No. Isn't that

30:40.047 --> 30:41.489
interesting? Did you know King Gill by chance? No, 
no. Okay. He was older. Describe Coach Norton's

30:46.295 --> 30:50.581
personality, I mean Coach Bible's personality. 
You said he was a good coach. Well, you know, I was

30:54.486 --> 30:57.310
just a little girl. I mean, I don't, the only time 
that I really came in contact with those people was

30:57.590 --> 31:06.882
we had a, We'd have summer picnics. Oh, describe 
those. And we'd go out to the old fish pot, which is

31:11.488 --> 31:19.875
sitting over here someplace now, close to the...
