WEBVTT

00:02.326 --> 00:09.857
We started trips abroad for all majors, majors or any others in our classes that wanted to go.

00:11.099 --> 00:12.841
And we had very good luck.

00:16.727 --> 00:17.928
Should I start from scratch?

00:18.609 --> 00:19.170
Start over?

00:19.811 --> 00:20.853
No, that's all right.

00:20.873 --> 00:22.495
It probably picked it up.

00:33.190 --> 00:42.602
And we had very good luck with some of our full associate professors taking the group.

00:44.225 --> 00:53.697
And at that time, we had our base in for the French group in La Rochelle, which is way off near Bordeaux.

00:55.567 --> 01:00.238
And it's a fascinating section of the country.

01:00.258 --> 01:04.047
It's not something that students normally would see, or even we would see.

01:05.250 --> 01:09.660
Anyway, here came this one year.

01:10.720 --> 01:16.167
Nobody was able to take the group, none of the experienced people.

01:17.048 --> 01:20.552
We had an arrangement with the Language Institute there.

01:21.033 --> 01:31.125
Students studied language in the morning and did cultural things in the afternoon, and I felt that it was very important.

01:31.105 --> 01:42.843
for the A&M representative, faculty member, to be very much involved in that and be sure that they didn't just turn them over to a museum guide or something, you know.

01:44.045 --> 01:47.851
So anyway, we tried to get the best people we could, and we were always lucky.

01:48.271 --> 01:53.940
Then one year, we couldn't, and I had a volunteer

01:54.713 --> 01:59.966
after I twisted her arm, and that was Gretchen Schmidt, you know, Hank Schmidt's wife.

02:00.808 --> 02:05.921
But Gretchen is a very timid soul, and she was really petrified.

02:06.823 --> 02:09.329
She wouldn't do it, but she was so afraid.

02:09.951 --> 02:10.933
I said, well, don't worry.

02:11.183 --> 02:13.505
I decided I was going to Europe anyway.

02:14.767 --> 02:16.649
I decided I would go with her.

02:16.669 --> 02:27.980
They always took a tour, a short three, four-day, five-day tour on a bus.

02:28.941 --> 02:36.389
I would do the tour with her and get them all settled in La Rochelle, and from there on out she could handle it.

02:36.409 --> 02:38.271
She was reassured, and that was fine.

02:38.723 --> 02:43.129
Well, I'm glad I went because we had a couple of funny students.

02:45.532 --> 02:53.523
There was one who had just gotten married, a man, a guy, and I think he missed his wife.

02:53.623 --> 02:54.825
He wished he were home.

02:56.247 --> 02:58.650
But instead, he picked on everything.

02:59.672 --> 03:02.496
He was negative, negative, negative.

03:02.516 --> 03:07.903
One day, I almost blew my top because I put up with a lot from this young man.

03:09.200 --> 03:15.569
We had bought picnic provisions, you know, good French bread and cheese, a bottle of wine, what have you.

03:16.751 --> 03:21.738
And he opened the cheese and he sniffed it, and he said, yuck, this thing.

03:21.758 --> 03:23.340
Threw it out the window of the bus.

03:26.104 --> 03:33.574
I had a little talk with him and told him that, number one, I wanted him to learn about French cheese.

03:33.594 --> 03:34.556
That's what the smell.

03:35.317 --> 03:38.481
And number two, that that is unacceptable behavior.

03:38.849 --> 03:42.935
And if he wanted to act like an ass, I was going to put him on the next fight home.

03:46.019 --> 03:53.510
But I thought the reaction of the other students was, look at their faces, and they didn't quite know what was going on.

03:54.051 --> 03:55.473
What's wrong with the cheese?

03:57.596 --> 04:03.064
But Gretchen said once they got there and got the class and all, he settled down too.

04:04.145 --> 04:08.772
Now, when did those European trips begin, as far as you know?

04:09.308 --> 04:09.769
In the 70s?

04:09.789 --> 04:10.630
70s.

04:11.552 --> 04:14.937
And did they become a requirement for a language major?

04:15.739 --> 04:15.819
No.

04:15.839 --> 04:21.328
We couldn't make it a requirement because we didn't have any funding to help out.

04:22.089 --> 04:28.841
There were some students who couldn't afford it, and some of them already had so many student loans they couldn't get any.

04:29.181 --> 04:31.485
We did arrange for those who wanted to.

04:31.988 --> 04:34.992
to get student loans, because many did.

04:35.213 --> 04:39.499
All right, then the faculty members' expenses, were they paid by you?

04:39.519 --> 04:40.080
They were paid.

04:40.580 --> 04:42.183
All right, but then the students paid their own?

04:42.203 --> 04:48.452
They were paid for, except when I went, for instance, it wasn't paid for, because we paid Gretchen.

04:49.353 --> 04:51.456
And I really just went along.

04:51.476 --> 04:58.045
I knew I was going to have a good time anyway, and I was going anyway, and it worked out fine.

04:59.067 --> 05:01.911
But we've always tried to,

05:03.427 --> 05:06.190
charge as little as we could get away with.

05:06.891 --> 05:10.135
But it's still quite a lot of money on top of everything else.

05:11.277 --> 05:18.065
And we have, and I think they still do now, trips to almost every place.

05:18.125 --> 05:21.709
We have trips to France, to Germany, to Russia.

05:22.771 --> 05:23.131
Italy.

05:23.652 --> 05:27.797
Cook, that's the name of the Russian instructors, man and wife.

05:28.197 --> 05:29.259
Olga Cook.

05:29.859 --> 05:31.982
C-O-O-K?

05:32.317 --> 05:34.800
Oh, okay.

05:34.840 --> 05:35.802
She's very nice.

05:37.204 --> 05:41.149
And anyway, they have taken them, I don't know how many times.

05:41.810 --> 05:44.834
And so we do this now every summer pretty regularly.

05:45.355 --> 05:54.106
Did the department have anything to do with A&M acquiring that center in Italy near Florence?

05:54.827 --> 05:56.810
No, we didn't really have an input on that.

05:56.830 --> 05:57.030
All right.

05:57.571 --> 05:59.033
How did that come about, do you know?

05:59.873 --> 06:03.700
That came, well, in a way, I mean, I was involved to some extent.

06:05.183 --> 06:13.198
Somebody, and I'm not sure who that was, thought it would be good if we had a sort of base somewhere in Europe.

06:14.099 --> 06:16.644
Might have been David Maxwell, I don't know whose idea it was.

06:17.425 --> 06:21.072
And one of my

06:21.642 --> 06:31.456
annual Treks to Europe, he asked me if I would go to the Strasbourg area and look at one particular place somebody had told him about.

06:31.496 --> 06:38.687
And so apparently there were several of us working on it without knowing what was going on.

06:39.688 --> 06:41.811
And I came back saying that was not a good place.

06:42.449 --> 06:43.530
Don't pick that one.

06:44.131 --> 06:59.729
And the reason for that was linguistic, because Strasbourg, as you know, historically, at the language they speak today, the older people still speak with an Alamanic dialect.

07:00.410 --> 07:02.212
And the French dialect is even worse.

07:02.993 --> 07:05.175
That's not a good place for students to learn French.

07:06.177 --> 07:11.663
So then we did get involved individually.

07:12.554 --> 07:15.919
But not with, for our own trips, but not with the one in Italy.

07:16.981 --> 07:19.484
Carolyn Adair has a lot to do with that.

07:21.027 --> 07:33.986
And I don't know, we never really, I get along with Jimmy while with Carolyn, we like each other, but we've never had any kind of connections in this.

07:35.489 --> 07:41.818
In any of those summer institute classes,

07:42.153 --> 07:46.038
Did you as a department head ever have to unravel any big snafu?

07:46.058 --> 07:49.282
Did anything come up?

07:49.302 --> 07:50.563
You know Claudine Hunting?

07:52.105 --> 07:56.391
Hunting, Claudine.

07:56.411 --> 07:57.232
I don't believe so.

07:57.252 --> 07:58.253
Turned it off.

07:58.273 --> 08:01.297
I had to testify about some of those things.

08:02.078 --> 08:03.520
I didn't like that one bit.

08:05.122 --> 08:09.527
What were some of the high points of your department head years?

08:10.334 --> 08:14.681
some of the points that you remember most proudly, enjoyably?

08:15.782 --> 08:17.445
I enjoyed every minute of it.

08:19.408 --> 08:20.670
But it wasn't all fun.

08:20.690 --> 08:24.816
There were a lot of headaches and a lot of problems.

08:25.337 --> 08:31.166
Describe the major task of being the department head.

08:31.887 --> 08:32.348
Tasks?

08:33.750 --> 08:35.953
What did you have to spend most of your time doing?

08:36.507 --> 08:42.981
Well, believe it or not, I spent most of my time counseling students, talking to students, whatever.

08:44.003 --> 08:47.350
I just seemed to have had a steady stream of them coming in all the time.

08:48.132 --> 08:53.103
And the only time I didn't was when I told my secretary, I'm going to have to work on the budget.

08:53.123 --> 08:53.985
I closed my door.

08:54.145 --> 08:55.528
Don't let anybody in.

08:56.555 --> 09:08.335
But there were students who complained about their instructors, students who wanted to know what they might do with a language major.

09:08.355 --> 09:09.196
I don't know.

09:09.577 --> 09:13.643
I got along well enough with students that they came to me, so I was pretty proud of that.

09:16.408 --> 09:20.014
Normally your work day was, what?

09:20.399 --> 09:21.860
You were on the campus normally?

09:21.880 --> 09:29.408
Well, I was brought up by Jack Nats, who sort of figured that we were eight to five people.

09:30.909 --> 09:49.107
And by the time I took over as department head, I had long since realized that most faculty don't work from eight to five.

09:49.880 --> 09:52.623
Oh, I was usually in the office by 8.30 every day.

09:52.923 --> 09:55.325
And that stayed until my work got done.

09:56.166 --> 09:59.249
It might be 6 o'clock, it might be 3.30.

10:00.090 --> 10:03.233
How much time did you have to spend working with faculty?

10:06.216 --> 10:07.577
Actually, not all that much.

10:08.979 --> 10:15.785
This was a very, very basically capable faculty.

10:16.326 --> 10:17.507
The ones we hired,

10:18.466 --> 10:24.733
after me, were just totally professional.

10:26.575 --> 10:30.900
We had to let some of those non-professional part-timers go.

10:31.501 --> 10:33.063
That was a hard thing for me to do.

10:34.144 --> 10:35.365
Jack had hired them.

10:36.266 --> 10:43.174
And then when I came in, first thing I had to do, we had, I think, four part-time women.

10:43.930 --> 10:46.753
Two were very good, two were hopeless.

10:47.494 --> 10:55.163
And in order to seem at least fair, I had to fire all four of them and simply say, we're abolishing this position.

10:55.504 --> 10:57.586
But I rehired two of them within a year.

10:58.387 --> 11:00.009
And they knew they would be rehired.

11:00.069 --> 11:01.791
I told them I wanted them back.

11:02.332 --> 11:06.597
But there was just no other good way of singling them out.

11:06.617 --> 11:09.781
And that was very painful because they were nice ladies.

11:09.821 --> 11:11.743
They were just not competent.

11:13.681 --> 11:19.668
And most of the people that you all began to hire then were Ph.D.?

11:20.209 --> 11:20.829
Ph.D.

11:21.430 --> 11:24.373
or ABD.

11:24.393 --> 11:30.741
And were there any particular programs that you looked at with preference when you hired?

11:31.281 --> 11:31.542
Oh, yeah.

11:31.922 --> 11:33.364
Where?

11:33.384 --> 11:38.530
Well, by then I had, I worked with committees.

11:38.550 --> 11:42.895
When I came on tour there was another committee around.

11:43.752 --> 11:47.878
There's always a little idiosyncratic preference.

11:47.898 --> 11:49.961
This is my old school or something, you know.

11:50.001 --> 11:55.028
But basically, the better universities.

11:56.049 --> 12:00.015
But we always had problems with the really tough ones.

12:02.358 --> 12:10.890
We interviewed a man from Harvard who turned us down.

12:12.254 --> 12:23.746
Generally speaking, the Ivy League doesn't fit into Texas very well, I think, because we've got a couple of them, but they left rather quickly, too.

12:24.567 --> 12:31.675
Did you find that A&M's reputation was a plus or a minus in recruitment?

12:31.695 --> 12:36.560
At that time, it didn't have a reputation, period, which was sort of a minus in a way.

12:38.122 --> 12:41.505
But people just didn't know much about it.

12:41.966 --> 12:42.126
Right.

12:44.435 --> 12:55.906
I think, excuse me, some of them came.

12:56.306 --> 12:57.267
Don't forget your lapel.

13:02.332 --> 13:05.976
Most of the people you recruited were at the assistant professor?

13:06.857 --> 13:08.038
Yes.

13:08.058 --> 13:11.661
Now, Wolf Kupke came... He came as full professor.

13:11.681 --> 13:12.602
And how did that...

13:20.615 --> 13:35.613
He came as a full professor along with those other two gentlemen from Rice.

13:35.633 --> 13:49.930
And the department was so terrible at the time of the German section.

13:50.416 --> 13:56.886
It was probably the poorest we had on the point of view of faculty.

13:57.427 --> 13:58.749
So this was to build it up?

13:58.909 --> 13:59.951
It was to build it up.

14:03.757 --> 14:11.289
And Bryson Camp was still with us.

14:11.309 --> 14:12.931
He retired shortly after that.

14:14.133 --> 14:18.600
Now, as you all were recruiting, did you feel that

14:19.846 --> 14:28.916
administration gave you about as much salary to offer as they could?

14:38.648 --> 14:39.649
At times, yes.

14:39.669 --> 14:41.010
At times, no.

14:41.030 --> 14:42.312
Oh, okay.

14:43.353 --> 14:46.056
There was some on either side.

14:48.618 --> 14:58.467
And I presume that there was never any problem about whether you hired a man or a woman or an Anglo or anyone else?

14:59.027 --> 15:01.309
That never entered into the picture at all.

15:01.750 --> 15:16.583
As a matter of fact, we tried to get as many minorities as we could, which was possible with Spanish, but not with other languages.

15:16.968 --> 15:36.377
And there was no problem hiring women.

15:37.399 --> 15:38.661
No problem hiring women.

15:38.721 --> 15:43.328
By that time, they were everywhere all of a sudden.

15:45.090 --> 15:46.232
And yeah, I remember

15:46.820 --> 15:59.953
We were really after a candidate for French, a French position, a lady, a black lady.

16:02.476 --> 16:04.117
We were very much impressed by her.

16:04.138 --> 16:14.548
She came for an interview, and everybody wanted her for a variety of reasons, all of them good.

16:16.148 --> 16:29.745
But the lady turned us down, saying, this is interesting, not because of Texas, not because she felt any racial problems might arise, because she said she's basically a teacher, not a researcher.

16:30.246 --> 16:34.511
She doesn't want to be under the pressure of having to publish in order to get tenure.

16:36.894 --> 16:38.276
So there.

16:38.296 --> 16:40.519
And altogether, you know, as department head,

16:42.001 --> 16:46.326
I'd get, of course, the Chronicle of Higher Education, a number of other publications.

16:47.107 --> 17:00.602
And if you looked at those figures, there were maybe three or four PhDs a year among some of the minorities, even less.

17:01.684 --> 17:08.532
But you know if you have two PhDs and two black PhDs, the whole country is going after them.

17:08.552 --> 17:09.713
Surely, surely.

17:09.845 --> 17:12.068
And that was always a problem.

17:12.629 --> 17:14.691
I really think it still is a problem.

17:16.714 --> 17:25.505
But we tried, I tried particularly, to get a sort of diversified faculty.

17:26.786 --> 17:36.038
I told my department in the deliberations to bear in mind sort of

17:36.862 --> 17:43.056
not overloading either the male, female, or white, black, Hispanic, whatever.

17:44.440 --> 17:49.932
We were lucky with the Spanish because I don't know if that's still true or not.

17:50.674 --> 17:55.866
I always thought it was ridiculous, but the federal government

17:56.825 --> 18:11.204
recognizes Latinos from South America or what have you, or from Spain, the way they would Mexican-American.

18:12.045 --> 18:15.610
As long as we had somebody with a Spanish surname, fine.

18:15.951 --> 18:19.475
And we got some wonderful people out of various countries.

18:19.495 --> 18:21.258
Well Luis Costa was one of them.

18:23.581 --> 18:24.402
You can't be any

18:26.170 --> 18:36.542
any more white and what have you than Luis, but he was classified as Hispanic and just made us look good.

18:37.443 --> 18:42.789
And so did another lady from Uruguay, and we had several of those.

18:43.269 --> 18:51.739
We actually attracted only about one or two Mexican Americans, and one of them, still at A&M,

18:52.192 --> 18:55.916
He is now the director of international programs.

18:56.756 --> 18:59.739
They gave him, they moved him over there.

19:01.201 --> 19:07.567
But he's a Mexican-American from the border area, and he has a Ph.D.

19:07.607 --> 19:08.828
from the University of Michigan.

19:10.570 --> 19:16.836
We always wished we could get more of those people, but it was difficult.

19:16.876 --> 19:17.777
Right.

19:17.943 --> 19:18.684
Am I correct?

19:18.904 --> 19:27.693
You felt that the administration supported and encouraged your department's efforts to... At that time, yes, very much so.

19:28.534 --> 19:32.217
There seemed to be a constant stream of communication.

19:32.237 --> 19:36.862
And as the years went on, more women began to enroll in the courses.

19:37.102 --> 19:38.123
Yes.

19:38.143 --> 19:44.209
And did that change the way the department operated at all?

19:47.092 --> 19:47.933
It...

19:48.470 --> 19:50.232
It gave us better students, frankly.

19:50.552 --> 19:51.173
Better students.

19:52.013 --> 20:00.722
It made us, it enabled many of us, I think, to do a better job in the classroom, because the student's response was different.

20:01.703 --> 20:10.892
Do you think that in your classes, in your last years, it was more difficult for a student, a student had to work harder to make an A than they had when you first got here?

20:14.295 --> 20:14.856
Possibly.

20:15.356 --> 20:16.638
I hadn't really thought about that.

20:17.558 --> 20:18.139
Possible.

20:18.946 --> 20:22.772
I think I did in mine without deliberately doing so.

20:22.792 --> 20:23.132
Exactly.

20:23.914 --> 20:27.118
I think it just comes with the territory.

20:27.138 --> 20:30.944
If the students are better, well, you demand more of them.

20:30.964 --> 20:38.235
Or I guess I should say, in your last years, were the students better prepared when they walked in the first day?

20:42.502 --> 20:43.463
Yes and no.

20:43.483 --> 20:44.785
Some were, some were.

20:46.840 --> 20:58.998
And in your later years, what percentage, what, did, there was still the big demand for service courses?

20:59.058 --> 21:00.040
Right.

21:00.060 --> 21:00.881
And the doctoral?

21:02.063 --> 21:03.365
Doctoral folded.

21:03.966 --> 21:05.328
Okay.

21:05.348 --> 21:06.209
Completely.

21:06.229 --> 21:07.351
Oh, because the department?

21:07.371 --> 21:08.232
They gave up the requirements.

21:08.252 --> 21:10.335
Okay.

21:10.355 --> 21:11.016
And so?

21:11.176 --> 21:12.358
Which was actually,

21:13.672 --> 21:24.984
useful at the time because it freed the faculty members to teach the additional sections of the undergraduate program.

21:25.764 --> 21:25.965
All right.

21:25.985 --> 21:33.472
By the time you retired, a student could major at the undergraduate level in what languages?

21:36.215 --> 21:40.119
French, Spanish, German, and Russian.

21:40.139 --> 21:41.080
Not Italian.

21:41.228 --> 21:45.072
They may have Italian now.

21:45.833 --> 21:48.276
And not any Asian language?

21:49.498 --> 21:50.419
No major in it.

21:51.700 --> 21:55.184
Then you offered service courses in what other languages?

21:57.947 --> 22:00.390
Almost any of our languages served.

22:00.410 --> 22:04.355
If they wanted to take two years of Chinese, they could do that.

22:04.455 --> 22:07.178
Still any Czech?

22:07.198 --> 22:09.100
We haven't had any Czech in a long time.

22:10.262 --> 22:10.662
Greek?

22:12.245 --> 22:14.288
Only one year, I think.

22:14.848 --> 22:19.495
But you know the requirements always say two years of the same language.

22:19.515 --> 22:20.756
And no Latin?

22:20.776 --> 22:24.441
Latin never did make, we teach Latin.

22:24.922 --> 22:26.544
But we never got a major out of it.

22:27.044 --> 22:35.536
And during all the years that you taught here, were there any shifts in popularity of any of the languages?

22:38.980 --> 22:40.362
Spanish was always

22:41.135 --> 22:41.976
Always number one.

22:42.097 --> 22:42.658
Number one.

22:43.539 --> 22:52.675
And I can understand that because it's something that they can see the practicality of it locally.

22:55.139 --> 22:55.600
Let's see.

22:56.642 --> 23:05.016
And there were undergraduate majors in these languages, and then describe the process of getting that master's degree approved.

23:06.042 --> 23:06.683
in Spanish.

23:07.805 --> 23:09.467
I didn't have too much to do with it.

23:09.487 --> 23:15.456
I turned it over to Chester Christian, who was our senior Spanish professor.

23:17.619 --> 23:28.675
Chester is a wonderful, lovable person, but he's also, he has an idiosyncratic way of doing things.

23:29.768 --> 23:36.076
He wrote the original proposal, and a lot of us, when we read it, we added, took out, and so on.

23:36.096 --> 23:37.377
It took us a good while.

23:37.397 --> 23:39.940
It took us three years, I think, to get it approved.

23:41.102 --> 23:49.572
But after that, I doubt that they're more than about, I don't know about today.

23:49.632 --> 23:50.994
I can't really speak for today.

23:51.515 --> 23:56.721
But when I retired in the late 80s,

23:58.220 --> 24:06.529
We never had more than maybe five or five graduate Spanish students in any one year.

24:07.130 --> 24:10.554
So that would be two or three master's degrees per year?

24:11.074 --> 24:12.856
Yep, right.

24:12.876 --> 24:17.261
And they were normal, most ordinarily, what was their background?

24:17.782 --> 24:18.202
What were they?

24:18.442 --> 24:20.625
Were they Anglo or were they Hispanic?

24:20.645 --> 24:22.207
They were Anglos.

24:22.227 --> 24:23.048
They were Anglos.

24:23.748 --> 24:26.151
And what were they planning to do, be teachers?

24:27.143 --> 24:30.269
Some planned being on teaching.

24:30.649 --> 24:37.241
Some planned, I think several of them that I knew wanted to go into international business.

24:38.684 --> 24:40.587
Were they Aggie undergraduates?

24:41.489 --> 24:44.474
Yeah.

24:44.494 --> 24:51.126
I don't think that we ever got a graduate student for a Spanish program who had not been an undergraduate at A&M.

24:52.473 --> 24:59.420
While you were department head, to whom did you turn outside the department for any advice or counsel?

25:03.605 --> 25:06.628
Usually, somebody in the dean's office.

25:06.648 --> 25:07.449
And who would that be?

25:07.549 --> 25:13.435
Well, early on it was Henry Pope, and later it was Danny Parker.

25:14.697 --> 25:17.940
Both of those gentlemen had just been a

25:19.118 --> 25:22.043
Really a great effort for me.

25:22.584 --> 25:23.826
Tremendous help.

25:25.328 --> 25:25.809
Let's see.

25:26.470 --> 25:28.454
Who succeeded Dave Maxwell as dean?

25:35.666 --> 25:36.087
Jones?

25:37.870 --> 25:38.751
I don't know.

25:38.871 --> 25:39.933
See, I was gone by then.

25:39.953 --> 25:42.337
I think I was gone, too.

25:42.357 --> 25:44.080
I don't know where.

25:45.460 --> 25:46.141
Oh, no.

25:46.161 --> 25:46.281
What?

25:46.301 --> 25:46.741
No, no, no.

25:46.761 --> 25:47.702
That was Keith Bryan.

25:48.063 --> 25:48.803
Keith, yes.

25:48.823 --> 25:49.364
Okay, yeah.

25:49.384 --> 25:49.584
All right.

25:49.604 --> 25:53.488
And did he continue to be supportive as Dr. Maxwell?

25:53.748 --> 25:53.908
No.

25:54.028 --> 25:56.270
He was not as supportive as Dean Maxwell was.

25:58.192 --> 26:02.997
He was the opposite of supportive.

26:03.678 --> 26:06.941
Were there any gifts to the program?

26:06.961 --> 26:08.963
Did anybody give any money?

26:11.745 --> 26:14.028
Any outsider given?

26:14.108 --> 26:14.488
Outsider?

26:15.751 --> 26:18.254
For some projects, strangely enough, they did.

26:18.675 --> 26:22.360
One of them was this Czech foundation.

26:22.400 --> 26:29.970
They were on my back the whole time I was department head to resume teaching Czech.

26:31.352 --> 26:39.323
Well, one year I gave in and tried it, and no students showed up.

26:39.343 --> 26:44.290
So I told all the rest of them, all those people who kept, they think that I was, you know,

26:44.928 --> 26:48.373
keeping it out on purpose that I didn't like it or something or other.

26:48.974 --> 26:50.556
But I said, look, there's no students.

26:50.576 --> 26:51.257
What can I do?

26:53.119 --> 27:02.633
But they give a lot to this foundation and they take trips to the Czech Republic occasionally and use the money.

27:04.015 --> 27:07.780
But no, I wouldn't say that

27:09.633 --> 27:21.110
We would have liked an endowment of some kind, but I understand from, at the time at least, talking to other department heads that that was very difficult for the department to do anyway.

27:22.793 --> 27:29.723
Did any person outside the department ever try to twist your arm to do something?

27:30.724 --> 27:31.586
Oh, some parents.

27:32.807 --> 27:34.510
Give some examples, please.

27:35.789 --> 27:39.134
Oh, you know, some dissatisfied parents.

27:39.675 --> 27:48.469
A couple of times they'd come in and want to find out why their son had made or whatever great.

27:48.489 --> 27:55.180
And about all I could say, and I was kind of glad of that, was, I can't discuss this with you unless he gives me permission to.

27:56.121 --> 27:57.383
What was their reaction to that?

27:58.405 --> 27:59.166
But he's our son.

27:59.266 --> 28:00.328
We're paying his bills.

28:00.569 --> 28:02.151
Papa was really angry.

28:03.447 --> 28:05.950
But I said, well, I'm sorry, but that's the law.

28:07.652 --> 28:10.515
And they never brought Junior in there then to... No!

28:11.476 --> 28:19.025
I told them, I said, if y'all wanted to have a conference, the two of you and your son and me, I'd be very happy to have one.

28:19.045 --> 28:19.886
They never came by.

28:20.847 --> 28:32.661
Did any administrator or board member or former student ever... A, believe it or not, a former...

28:35.948 --> 28:37.390
track coach, I think.

28:38.330 --> 28:39.452
Track or baseball.

28:40.653 --> 28:55.849
Anyway, he came to tell me that I was being unfair to two of his students, and after all they were athletes and scholarships, and they were the mainstay of his team or whatever, and please give him a better grade.

28:57.951 --> 28:59.473
What was your response?

29:00.273 --> 29:01.855
I laughed.

29:02.442 --> 29:05.065
I said, you know, I think that's kind of funny.

29:05.666 --> 29:06.867
You shouldn't be doing this.

29:09.570 --> 29:15.777
And he said, well, you've got to get these guys, talk to your guys, get them to do their work.

29:17.839 --> 29:20.382
And that was that.

29:20.942 --> 29:27.049
There was always a lot of that sort of thing going on, one thing after another, never really very earth-shaking.

29:27.839 --> 29:29.060
No politician.

29:29.801 --> 29:30.042
No.

29:30.062 --> 29:30.923
No legislator.

29:30.943 --> 29:31.143
Not once.

29:32.364 --> 29:32.645
Not once.

29:33.225 --> 29:35.668
And no board member, no regent.

29:35.688 --> 29:37.610
No.

29:39.533 --> 29:46.921
Were y'all, did you ever get any advice on what courses to add or to take away?

29:47.542 --> 29:48.623
What courses to offer?

29:49.444 --> 29:54.690
Only internally, if whoever dean was in there.

29:55.109 --> 29:58.252
felt that we didn't have enough enrollment or something like that.

29:58.272 --> 30:07.462
The question would come up, maybe you should do away with this, but not very often.

30:07.482 --> 30:08.424
Not from the outside.

30:08.904 --> 30:18.875
All right, as the department made progress, other than you, who else in the department deserved most of the credit for the progress the department made?

30:19.496 --> 30:23.580
I would say that Wolf Kupke,

30:24.522 --> 30:25.584
Just a Christian.

30:27.166 --> 30:28.888
Probably deserved most of the credit.

30:31.792 --> 30:36.319
They were very good with the junior faculty.

30:41.446 --> 30:45.952
Wolf, particularly, would come into my office frequently with an idea.

30:45.972 --> 30:50.218
We would just kick the idea around, see what we could make of it.

30:51.200 --> 30:53.483
And frequently something came of it.

30:54.560 --> 31:01.808
And the department made its major decisions as the whole department met, or was there a kind of an executive committee?

31:03.089 --> 31:10.117
No, we didn't have an executive committee, but we had a group committee, you might say.

31:10.137 --> 31:13.120
We had a committee for French.

31:13.140 --> 31:14.221
Oh, for each of the sections.

31:14.241 --> 31:15.523
Another one for each separate language.

31:16.304 --> 31:18.646
Am I correct that you all used the word section?

31:19.027 --> 31:19.267
Yes.

31:19.387 --> 31:19.928
French section.

31:19.948 --> 31:21.169
Right.

31:21.189 --> 31:23.031
So that, you know, this...

31:24.580 --> 31:25.715
would help in
