WEBVTT

00:02.107 --> 00:24.030
Calling in tactical air support and assisting the 
forward air controller who was airborne also in

00:02.107 --> 00:24.030
his little bird dog airplane and getting fire in on 
the enemy

00:02.107 --> 00:24.030
and at the same time I'd call for Smokey Smokey is a 
fella in an old DC-3 that comes in and drops flares

00:25.057 --> 00:35.150
for you. So you can see it light up the area. We're 
talking about 2 or 3 in the morning? Oh, we're

00:42.659 --> 00:47.806
talking about now it's 2 o'clock, 3 o'clock, 4 
o'clock. So we're beating them back pretty

00:49.188 --> 00:51.891
heavily. and have just kept them out of that troop 
of cavalry. I mean, 1900 against 125, you know,

00:58.686 --> 01:04.872
that's a hellacious odds. So

01:04.892 --> 01:14.723
we had been doing very well. And in the meantime, 
the battalion commander A lieutenant colonel who

01:21.402 --> 01:47.697
had come up from the ranks and was out of World War 
II, believe it or not he was a private in the

01:21.402 --> 01:47.697
reconnaissance troop of the 1st Division during 
World War II as a private about 16 years old and now

01:21.402 --> 01:47.697
here he is a lieutenant colonel here commanding 
the 5th Cavalry of the 9th Division which is a

01:21.402 --> 01:47.697
reconnaissance squadron. And here they are 
attached to the big red one. And he said he wanted to

01:53.856 --> 01:59.145
get in the fire base with the captain. I said, well, 
you're going to have to fight your way in there and

01:59.165 --> 02:03.712
I'll help you get in. He said, I'm going to take two 
of my track vehicles, M-113 personnel carrier

02:03.752 --> 02:13.449
track vehicles, and said, we're going to shoot our 
way through. And I said, Fine, because I said if his

02:14.980 --> 02:25.852
radio goes down I need all the radios that I can get 
in there that I can talk to so that we can direct this

02:14.980 --> 02:25.852
battle properly. One of his vehicles was knocked 
out and he got out under fire and backed up his van.

02:34.962 --> 02:40.369
His radio operator was killed and the commander of 
that vehicle was killed. He got out himself

02:40.389 --> 02:43.452
personally and and hooked up his vehicle, another 
113 personnel carrier, command type vehicle, to

02:44.663 --> 03:00.421
the vehicle that had been destroyed and drug it 
into the perimeter.

03:04.165 --> 03:10.452
He won, he was presented Distinguished Service 
Cross for this action, To make a long story short, I

03:12.642 --> 03:36.838
knew that it was 4 o'clock in the morning, 4.30 in 
the morning, and I alerted everyone to the fact

03:12.642 --> 03:36.838
that I felt that that regiment, their losses being 
very heavy, would attempt another assault at

03:12.642 --> 03:36.838
about 5 o'clock in the morning. And that I wanted 
the... The... In secure, with secure

03:42.443 --> 04:08.367
communications, I talked to the commander on the 
ground, now Lieutenant Colonel Haphazard, and I

03:42.443 --> 04:08.367
said, I want at 5.15

03:42.443 --> 04:08.367
or earlier, depending on when this last and final 
assault comes, I want every vehicle turn every

04:08.802 --> 04:32.025
vehicle that's capable of turning on its lights to 
turn them on as soon as that assault occurs and uh

04:08.802 --> 04:32.025
this is kind of like exposing yourself to 
everything in their eyes they said oh i said that's

04:08.802 --> 04:32.025
exactly the way i want it I had 15 sorties of TAC air 
stacked up, 15 airplanes stacked up waiting. I had

04:45.011 --> 04:51.702
the artillery all cocked and primed although they 
were still shooting at designated targets.

04:55.628 --> 04:57.591
Well sure enough at about 0510 in the morning a fire 
began to come in, the intensity of the fire began to

04:58.617 --> 05:05.704
come in. At 0515 the commies got up and started to 
move and I started peeling off those fighter

05:05.724 --> 05:14.613
bombers with CBU and napalm and we murdered them. 
And when it was all over with and daylight came we

05:17.416 --> 05:27.747
had three dead cavalrymen and eleven slightly 
wounded. Now there's no 125 of anybody's soldiers

05:29.650 --> 05:56.299
in anybody's army in the world can stand up to 1,900 
soldiers

05:29.650 --> 05:56.299
and only lose three men and 11 wounded Five hours 
plus of battle, of intense battle, except the

05:57.511 --> 06:08.516
United States Army soldiers supported by the 
United States Air Force. That's the only 125

06:08.877 --> 06:14.490
little guys in the world that can do that sort of 
job. And the next day the enemy, how many they drug

06:15.365 --> 06:27.843
off, we don't know, but they left 499 dead on the 
battlefield, which is a sacred sin and a dishonor

06:15.365 --> 06:27.843
to the bastards.

06:30.727 --> 06:34.052
But that's what firepower will do. Properly 
directed

06:34.072 --> 06:41.663
by somebody that knows what the hell he's doing. 
And the continuous firepower on the enemy Then on

06:45.993 --> 07:14.127
April 1st at a place called AP, A-P,

06:45.993 --> 07:14.127
capital G-U,

06:45.993 --> 07:14.127
the 26th Infantry was commanded by Lieutenant 
Colonel Alexander M. Haig, Jr. And they were air

06:45.993 --> 07:14.127
assaulted in the afternoon of March 31st.

07:16.165 --> 07:28.977
into this area, which was at one time some 20 years 
ago before the communists uprooted the civilian

07:16.165 --> 07:28.977
populace there and murdered them all and took over 
the country, was a small village. But the

07:30.338 --> 07:34.542
communists had killed everyone and taken over 
themselves. And this was about two miles from the

07:34.602 --> 07:41.609
Cambodian border in Tainan province. And we were 
operating in that area. And Lieutenant Colonel

07:46.574 --> 08:12.212
Haig had air assaulted into this area with the 1st 
Battalion of 26th Infantry in the afternoon and

07:46.574 --> 08:12.212
immediately sent out his reconnaissance

07:46.574 --> 08:12.212
platoon commanded by Lieutenant Hill to do the 
necessary scout and reconnaissance while his

07:46.574 --> 08:12.212
battalion dug in. They were going to spend the 
night there and attack from there the next day.

08:16.409 --> 08:18.051
along the Cambodian border.

08:22.898 --> 08:45.370
The reconnaissance platoon had not moved more 
than 300 meters from the perimeter that

08:22.898 --> 08:45.370
the former Secretary of State, Alexander Haig, 
then Lieutenant Colonel, was digging himself in

08:22.898 --> 08:45.370
on the perimeter. When Lieutenant Hill bumped 
into a heavy formation, he was killed along with

08:47.341 --> 08:55.070
two others. And Lieutenant Colonel Haig in a H-13 
Bell helicopter, which is almost nothing, was up

08:56.952 --> 09:14.293
over those men, received intense fire, was shot 
down, and helicopter fell. and he and the pilot got

09:14.881 --> 09:33.362
away from him before he burned and he proceeded on 
foot

09:14.881 --> 09:33.362
to get with that recon platoon and remove the 
wounded and his dead Lieutenant Hill. As a result

09:35.905 --> 09:41.091
of that action that afternoon and I personally 
observed it and was there I recommended

09:43.298 --> 10:06.439
Lieutenant Colonel Haig for the Distinguished 
Flying Cross and

09:43.298 --> 10:06.439
for his ground actions and that afternoon and the 
next day the Distinguished Service Cross. The

10:08.260 --> 10:11.483
night was settling and wore on and at 0530 in the 
morning his battalion was hit by 400 plus rounds of

10:12.408 --> 10:29.946
heavy mortar fire.

10:29.966 --> 10:39.816
I immediately went to the scene

10:29.966 --> 10:39.816
in my command helicopter

10:44.470 --> 11:13.127
um

10:44.470 --> 11:13.127
believing in firepower the artillery had been 
placed that day and in their early hours of the

10:44.470 --> 11:13.127
evening to fire and support the division's 
operations the next day along the cambodian

10:44.470 --> 11:13.127
border

10:44.470 --> 11:13.127
william immediately, Colonel Haig immediately 
called for artillery fire for which he received

11:13.765 --> 11:32.052
instantaneously and for tactical air support. At 
537 the first, and this is significant now, at 537

11:32.072 --> 11:41.747
in the morning the first tactical air arrived. 
Remember the mortars came in at 5.30. That's very

11:45.797 --> 11:54.207
significant because most people don't know how to 
use tactical air. I'd say one out of every 400,000

11:54.407 --> 12:06.081
in the Army, that means today they listen to people 
that know how to use tactical air. I'm talking

12:06.282 --> 12:08.945
about officer or enlisted men. That's every 
experience. Yeah, they don't know anything about

12:10.587 --> 12:11.768
it. Why is that? They've never experienced it, and 
they don't know how to set it up. You see, if you want

12:18.996 --> 12:30.950
to attack air early in the target, what you do is 
pre-plan the missions to be delivered sometime on

12:18.996 --> 12:30.950
your targets. You pre-plan missions during the 
night at the point in time in which you expect the

12:30.990 --> 12:38.059
enemy to attack. I always expected the enemy to 
attack at 5 30 in the morning and at midnight so I'd

12:39.068 --> 13:06.088
say to the Air Force I want my pre-planned missions 
on targets on known targets that I want bombed

12:39.068 --> 13:06.088
during the night and struck during the night

12:39.068 --> 13:06.088
I want those missions those sorties to be 
delivered From 11.30 until 1 o'clock and from 5

13:07.182 --> 13:12.567
o'clock until 6 o'clock in the morning.

13:15.670 --> 13:17.192
Okay, they're up. They're loaded. They're in the 
process of delivering them. Then when the enemy

13:21.016 --> 13:27.202
strikes, you divert those that are airborne and go 
there immediately. Instead of waiting to wake up a

13:28.403 --> 13:37.172
pilot and to load up a ship and wait for that and 
while you get eat up by the enemy. So it all depends

13:37.642 --> 13:44.091
on how professional you are about how you get on 
with getting your job done. Well, that's the way to

13:44.111 --> 13:45.313
do it. And that's the way it was done in the First 
Division. So

13:52.303 --> 14:07.024
between 0537 and 958

13:52.303 --> 14:07.024
the next morning when the enemy decided they 
didn't want anymore,

14:09.873 --> 14:12.495
We set probably a world record. We put in 133 
sorties attack air and fired more than 15,000

14:12.535 --> 14:39.019
rounds of 155, 105, and 8-inch artillery on the 271 
Regiment and the 1st Battalion of the 1st NVA

14:12.535 --> 14:39.019
Regiment, which totaled about 2,800, 2,900 
strength. Again,

14:40.720 --> 15:00.764
28, 2900 against about 500 was the strength of 
Colonel Hegg's battalion, except they

14:40.720 --> 15:00.764
concentrated only against B and C Company. A 
Company, we took its ammunition and gave it to B and

15:02.766 --> 15:09.594
C Company during the night. Colonel Hegg did that. 
A company wasn't even scratched by this entire

15:12.530 --> 15:21.099
reinforced regiment. And I want to tell you that we 
tore those people to shreds. They left more than

15:29.889 --> 15:32.111
600 dead.

15:34.534 --> 15:36.956
And we had 37 killed and wounded.

15:40.120 --> 15:42.182
And as a result of that action, and what he had done 
before, I recommended

15:44.373 --> 15:56.828
Lieutenant Colonel Haig for the Distinguished 
Service Cross, which he has.

15:59.732 --> 16:13.148
Again, a phenomenal action of American soldier 
and know-how against extreme unheard of odds.

16:18.983 --> 16:20.024
six to one. And when you start looking at how many 
was in action, it's probably ten to one because

16:21.766 --> 16:35.801
they only hit elements of two of the companies in 
the perimeter, two of the rifle companies in the

16:21.766 --> 16:35.801
perimeter.

16:40.926 --> 16:44.670
There are two examples of Now, the Vice Chief of 
Staff of the Army, General Bruce Palmer, who was in

16:46.405 --> 17:09.035
Vietnam at the time as a Lieutenant General, he 
felt that the action of General Haig and his, in

16:46.405 --> 17:09.035
that particular battle, would probably go down in 
history as the greatest battle at up to that point

16:46.405 --> 17:09.035
in time in Vietnam. No kidding? Yes, it was really a 
significant showing on the part of American

17:16.696 --> 17:18.959
know-how against the Communists. And again, as an 
action of the First Division.

17:33.999 --> 17:35.481
I went home in the late May.

17:39.887 --> 17:43.311
The brigade commander was wounded that day.

17:45.940 --> 17:54.790
who the commander in which Colonel Hegg's 26th 
Infantry was assigned to. And after that battle,

17:56.071 --> 18:02.258
Colonel Hegg became their brigade commander. 
From there he was selected to go to West Point as a

18:03.079 --> 18:09.045
regimental tactical, regimental tactical 
commander with one regiment of cadets.

18:19.502 --> 18:38.526
I came back to the United States and we were having 
severe problems with the Congress on the bad

18:19.502 --> 18:38.526
results of the M16 rifle, on the poor results of the 
multi-fuel engine There's some 11,000

18:39.147 --> 18:54.984
multi-fuel engines made by Continental Motors in 
Muskegon that had performed so poorly that 11,000

18:39.147 --> 18:54.984
of them are laying over there in Korea. So that's 
bad. Congress is raising hell and rightfully so

18:59.529 --> 19:02.893
about this. And then there was a push to get a light 
vehicle called the M551 with a Sheridan missile

19:04.477 --> 19:11.927
system. General Westmoreland was hollering for 
it. Chief of Staff of the Army said, I'd like for you

19:15.992 --> 19:31.513
to go to Aberdeen Proving Grounds and put some 
combat experience into testing of this equipment

19:15.992 --> 19:31.513
because I'm tired of the Congress beating us to 
death on the inadequacies of this equipment. and

19:32.793 --> 19:37.460
said, I feel it's because we're not testing it 
properly before we go to the field. I rendered a

19:38.522 --> 20:00.775
report within six months to the Chief of Staff of 
the Army that it was not the testing,

19:38.522 --> 20:00.775
but it was the insistence

19:38.522 --> 20:00.775
on getting the stuff into the field before it was 
ready as a result of a Vietnamese conflict. And I

20:02.240 --> 20:09.148
said, leave the people alone and let them test it 
properly before you introduce it into the field.

20:11.330 --> 20:13.653
At about that time, Detroit blew up. Washington, 
D.C. blew up. Newark, New Jersey blew up.

20:18.839 --> 20:19.640
Disaster. Democracy creating anarchy. Anarchy 
within democracy. So you question, is democracy

20:25.727 --> 20:29.251
the right way to go or not? We created it. anarchy 
here. You're destroying the damn country. You're

20:35.235 --> 20:39.780
blowing up banks, churches, public buildings, 
schools. What in the hell is democracy doing for

20:40.520 --> 20:44.004
the American people? This is displaying the world 
and particularly the communists who are

20:46.026 --> 20:53.474
exploiting it that democracy is a total damn 
failure.

20:56.136 --> 20:57.778
So

20:59.513 --> 21:11.189
In such instances, as you know, under the 
Constitution, it provided national guard for the

20:59.513 --> 21:11.189
state's forces and militia to assist the governor 
in maintaining internal law and order. And in each

21:11.389 --> 21:14.052
instance, there were total failures. Failure in 
Detroit, failure in Newark, failure in

21:15.534 --> 21:27.310
Washington, D.C. And regular forces, active duty 
forces, were called in. help stop those riotous

21:28.876 --> 21:55.980
situations and this is a embarrassment to the 
United States people in the throughout the world

21:28.876 --> 21:55.980
shining example of what must not happen total 
anarchy

21:28.876 --> 21:55.980
so

21:59.099 --> 22:18.060
President Lyndon B. Johnson

21:59.099 --> 22:18.060
asked the former governor of Ohio

21:59.099 --> 22:18.060
to set up a commission to look at what in the name of 
God is going on in this country. I can't remember

22:19.782 --> 22:22.505
the name of the former governor. He was one that had 
some strength. some criticism up there you know

22:26.133 --> 22:55.920
how he's doing business and Kinder I can't 
remember now what his name was but anyway it

22:26.133 --> 22:55.920
finally boiled down to me being pulled out of 
pulled out of Aberdeen Proving Grounds testing

22:26.133 --> 22:55.920
business by the chief of staff the army to go do a 
thorough investigation of the failures in

22:57.385 --> 23:06.078
Detroit, Washington, D.C., and Newark of the 
National Guard. No kidding. Why do you think that

23:06.658 --> 23:08.681
they picked you? Because of your experience with 
the reserves before? I guess so. So it's kind of

23:13.308 --> 23:24.304
more or less a chief of staff, the Army 
presidential, president, joint selectee to go do

23:13.308 --> 23:24.304
this.

23:26.782 --> 23:52.148
So I put together a team of about 20 officers,

23:26.782 --> 23:52.148
took a special mission aircraft, and between July 
and February of the next year, I visited 90% of the

23:26.782 --> 23:52.148
states,

23:26.782 --> 23:52.148
and particularly concentrated on what had gone 
wrong in Detroit, and what had gone wrong in

23:52.938 --> 24:19.045
Newark, and what had gone wrong in Washington, 
D.C.

23:52.938 --> 24:19.045
And it came up with what was known as the 
Hollingsworth

23:52.938 --> 24:19.045
Report,

23:52.938 --> 24:19.045
which was very, very critical of the inadequacies

23:52.938 --> 24:19.045
of the Reserve and the National Guard. Do you have a 
copy of that? All the copies I have of those are in

24:21.946 --> 24:30.456
Washington, D.C. What did it say? It said that we 
don't have, if we can't control internal security

24:30.476 --> 24:48.696
of our country, how do you expect these forces in a 
time of war to be of any help to the external threat

24:30.476 --> 24:48.696
if you can't even handle the internal threat? It 
sent forth some 50 recommendations to get

24:50.684 --> 25:02.341
ourselves sorted out, of which I think there was 
final approval on about 48 of them. Really? Yes.

25:04.864 --> 25:20.286
Establish proper schooling, clean out people, 
get rid of the dead wood,

25:04.864 --> 25:20.286
properly training, properly equipping people,

25:20.907 --> 25:43.838
primarily to reinforce

25:20.907 --> 25:43.838
and select and train leadership in the National 
Guard and I did not exclude the Reserves because I

25:20.907 --> 25:43.838
took advantage of the fact to look at the Reserves 
also because they were just as lousy as the Guard in

25:20.907 --> 25:43.838
many instances. Totally. You don't have to look at 
the Cuban call up and then see how lousy that is. And

25:57.359 --> 26:12.295
then to go have your country collapse and the guard 
and the states and governors are calling for

25:57.359 --> 26:12.295
active duty forces, 82nd Airborne and others to 
come put the thing in order. You don't have to be a

26:12.575 --> 26:14.257
blind man. You don't have to A third grader can see 
that. Sure. That you've got disaster on your

26:21.071 --> 26:23.073
hands. And I think that report went a long ways to 
alerting everybody to the fact that you don't have

26:25.195 --> 26:31.602
anything out here. You're just fooling yourself. 
Again, this is a leniency. They have fluency. The

26:43.392 --> 26:47.657
lack of discipline amongst the people.

26:52.103 --> 26:55.026
And we have some real failures. We have some real 
failings amongst ourselves, you know. And

26:59.872 --> 27:06.661
unfortunately in our country, we can't recognize 
our own inadequacies.

27:09.364 --> 27:10.065
Oftentimes. Most of the times you cannot. And then 
when you do, you don't want to accept it.

27:24.759 --> 27:41.361
This is the reason why one of the most worrisome 
things to me in

27:24.759 --> 27:41.361
the defense of this country is whether the 
political elements from the President to the

27:24.759 --> 27:41.361
Congress will accept the cold hard facts of a 
communist threat and do something about it or

27:43.450 --> 28:10.943
they'll try to pass information off so that they 
don't believe it and then this country get the

27:43.450 --> 28:10.943
biggest shock of its life and lose the whole damn 
show because of politics and weak leadership, not

28:12.442 --> 28:18.551
willing to accept the cold, hard facts of life. So, 
you know, to have a good intelligence collecting

28:19.612 --> 28:30.288
capability is one thing, and to disseminate it to 
the right people is another thing. But then to get

28:31.289 --> 28:38.820
those that it's disseminated to to face the real 
world and take some action, where it needs to be,

28:41.298 --> 28:46.586
that's another thing.

28:46.606 --> 28:49.530
And it takes a lot of backbone. It takes a lot of 
courage. It takes a lot of know-how. It takes a lot

28:53.136 --> 28:59.105
of professionalism to stand up and say, by God, I 
was wrong. We did not properly support our

29:00.707 --> 29:09.280
military here with what they need to do the job 
with. And now the enemy is just kind of driving us up

29:09.682 --> 29:14.649
the damn wall.

29:17.613 --> 29:17.973
You see? And this is the most worrisome thing. It's 
like, for example, I'll give you a good example of

29:24.342 --> 29:28.027
what I'm talking about. The

29:28.047 --> 29:34.035
most warning that you'll probably receive

29:37.373 --> 29:44.361
of attacks against NATO in Central Europe by the 
Warsaw Pact will probably be 48 hours.

29:48.787 --> 29:53.472
Now, in order to prepare yourself for that sort of 
attack, it costs a lot of money. Mr. Reagan is the

29:56.056 --> 30:05.507
only one that's been able to face up to that because 
it costs a lot of money to prepare yourself against

29:56.056 --> 30:05.507
that. When you look at the real world, you're only 
going to have about 24 hours because in the NATO

30:07.445 --> 30:28.939
alliance, 15 member nations have to get together 
and spend 24 hours making a determination on

30:07.445 --> 30:28.939
whether or not these indicators that there will be 
an attack in 48 hours are really true or not. And

30:29.960 --> 30:34.127
then you leave yourself only 24 hours to respond. 
And it takes us three days or more to reinforce our

30:35.221 --> 30:48.400
air capability, and the Army doesn't get any 
assistance for ten days or more, because there's

30:35.221 --> 30:48.400
no air left. And when I took command of the Warsaw 
Pact in 1976, in the Hollingsworth study now of

30:48.420 --> 30:57.313
NATO, for the Secretary of the Army and for the 
Chairman of the Senate Armed Services Committee,

30:58.593 --> 31:08.523
a joint requirement from those two to me. I took the 
Ruhr in 72 hours.

31:16.491 --> 31:19.313
And where is the United States in 72 hours? They 
don't even have all their air over there yet.

31:24.759 --> 31:27.081
And when you take the Ruhr in Germany, You've got 
the heart of it, it's all over with. Soviets

31:33.939 --> 31:38.764
playing around with marching to Antwerp in seven 
days. I'd relieve the damn Soviet commander that

31:40.346 --> 31:44.851
took that long to get to Antwerp. Hell, he couldn't 
work for me, but he's too damn slow. You can do it, I

31:52.699 --> 31:56.443
can take their forces and do it quicker than that. 
So if I can do that, you've got to give them credit

31:58.128 --> 32:02.553
for being able to do it. So then you now get moving on 
what's necessary in order to avoid that sort of

32:02.894 --> 32:10.182
thing. What did President Johnson say about your 
report, Hollinsworth report? Oh, you mean we're

32:19.373 --> 32:21.155
going back now? We're going back to the 1968 
period? I don't know what he said. Did he read it?

32:26.196 --> 32:29.340
The National Security Council was briefed. And 
whether they briefed the president or not, I don't

32:29.360 --> 32:31.724
know. I imagine that they did.

32:37.131 --> 32:40.315
Because he was an instigator of it coming off. And 
he was quite right. If the National Guard can't do

32:44.001 --> 32:49.528
this thing, maybe we need more active duty forces. 
Maybe we don't need a National Guard. But that's

32:52.833 --> 32:53.854
not the case. We do need a National Guard. for 
internal security and to support the governor and

32:56.718 --> 33:05.907
the state police and the state municipal police in 
the case of disasters of any kind. And secondly, to

33:06.027 --> 33:15.737
be prepared to accept a role in support of the 
active forces wherever they need to be in the

33:06.027 --> 33:15.737
world. They've got to play an important role. But 
by God, they've got to be prepared and ready to do

33:18.199 --> 33:21.642
something. Did you meet LBJ? Oh, yes. When? back in 
1953, back when he was in the Senate. Oh yeah, many

33:34.063 --> 33:35.084
times. He and Lady Bird both. What was your 
impression? First-class politician of the

33:41.191 --> 33:53.425
highest order

33:41.191 --> 33:53.425
and who got things done through the political 
process. Very effective.

33:59.189 --> 34:00.191
No question about it. Sam Rayburn was even far 
superior to him, who was Speaker of the House.

34:08.683 --> 34:19.339
Now that,

34:08.683 --> 34:19.339
Rayburn Johnson was the old political regime in 
which Tip O'Neill is still one of.

34:23.706 --> 34:26.530
And it's kind of dying out to a degree.

34:30.357 --> 34:32.360
isn't so much as it used to be. They don't have so 
much power as they used to have. Now, at the end of

34:37.509 --> 34:44.701
this report then you were sent to Fort Jackson in 
South Carolina. Yes, I was called in and said we

34:45.061 --> 34:56.500
have a major general down there training 
infantrymen for combat who is practicing

34:45.061 --> 34:56.500
on-the-job retirement. What a way to put it, on the 
job retirement. Yeah. And go down there as a deputy

35:02.785 --> 35:07.973
and prepared to take over this thing. That's all 
there was to it. And I did that.

35:15.205 --> 35:16.607
On the job retirement. That's pretty good. So he 
was sleeping. Yes, very much so. And it was at... at

35:25.471 --> 35:28.396
that time that you got your second star. Yes, 
that's right. My second star, and

35:30.119 --> 35:46.345
I then went to take over U.S. Army Alaska. Right, 
but at Port Jackson were you training men for

35:46.365 --> 35:50.432
Vietnam? Yes, during my time there I trained a 
quarter of a million, about, we trained about as I

35:50.648 --> 36:02.141
think about 125 to 150,000 a year, combat 
infantrymen. And

36:04.144 --> 36:14.175
I had a chance to study all these people, some of 
them were volunteers, most of them were draftees.

36:16.231 --> 36:36.231
And I had some very revealing, some very 
interesting facts came from that and testing and

36:16.231 --> 36:36.231
watching these men and taking necessary 
information and analyzing and looking at where

36:16.231 --> 36:36.231
people had been and what they were and so on and so 
forth. And I found a very disturbing situation

36:37.493 --> 36:47.087
that 22% of the high school diploma holders could 
not pass a fifth grade reading and writing. 22%

36:47.107 --> 37:02.590
of the high school diploma holders, graduates, 
that I received could not pass a fifth grade

36:47.107 --> 37:02.590
reading and writing and arithmetic. And I thought 
this is the damnedest indictment against our

37:07.227 --> 37:28.307
public and private educational system again it 
led me to say what in the name of God is this country

37:07.227 --> 37:28.307
doing to itself

37:07.227 --> 37:28.307
and I learned a new term for the first time social 
promotion

37:31.983 --> 37:59.796
if the guy's a total failure in the first grade 
after he's been there maybe the second time if

37:31.983 --> 37:59.796
you've got guts enough to do it give him a social 
promotion to the second grade because he's

37:31.983 --> 37:59.796
getting too big in size for or she for the rest of the 
little fellas and you just go ahead and do that

37:31.983 --> 37:59.796
right through on out the 12th grade and I think this 
is the most damaging thing to the American system.

38:07.274 --> 38:29.985
It's kind of like

38:07.274 --> 38:29.985
Governor Clements here trying to focus in on 
getting our education system to stand up with some

38:07.274 --> 38:29.985
guts

38:07.274 --> 38:29.985
and teach these people how to read and write our 
youth. And I think they deserve that. I found a

38:38.902 --> 38:55.922
percentage of one-year and two-year college 
students, a small percentage of those who could

38:38.902 --> 38:55.922
not pass the fifth grade comprehensive of 
one-year and two-year college levels at that

38:38.902 --> 38:55.922
time. When you were in command there, this was 
right after the Tet Offensive in January of 1968,

38:56.560 --> 39:21.302
and after that time there was a growing distaste 
for the war in Vietnam, and of course we were still

38:56.560 --> 39:21.302
building our number of our troop strength, and it 
didn't come to half our 500 60,000 until 1969 so we

39:21.586 --> 39:28.472
were still building and so we were drafting more. A 
lot has been said about the quality of these men who

39:28.492 --> 39:43.886
were going over to Vietnam and we're going to talk 
about the quality of the soldiers that you had in

39:28.492 --> 39:43.886
Vietnam later but right now what about the quality 
of these recruits, these draftees? These

39:46.068 --> 39:51.373
draftees were a cross-section of the eastern part 
of the United States out to include Ohio, West

39:51.590 --> 40:08.392
Virginia, Tennessee, and generally speaking the 
ones I had at Fort Jackson with some exceptions

39:51.590 --> 40:08.392
where you'd have an overflow in some other place. 
Most of them were from east of the Mississippi,

40:08.833 --> 40:19.487
although you would get some maybe a hundred or two 
hundred from here from west of the Mississippi,

40:08.833 --> 40:19.487
but most of them were east of the Mississippi. I 
thought they represented a cross-section of the

40:20.598 --> 40:26.167
United States. I thought that

40:26.768 --> 40:43.936
I was getting more of the communist inspired types 
than I would expect as my share. As a matter of fact,

40:48.695 --> 40:56.324
I did have five commies try to create a disturbance 
one evening in one of my brigades. Tell me about it.

40:58.467 --> 41:00.750
And I locked them up. I threw them in jail. Well, 
tell me about it. What did they try to do, more

41:04.955 --> 41:06.557
specifically? Well, they tried to, they were in 
the— Did they admit that they were commies? Oh,

41:11.403 --> 41:18.111
they were Associates Worker Party guys and also 
mousy tongue types out of Chicago. They

41:19.340 --> 41:41.668
were heavily supported by the ACLU and

41:19.340 --> 41:41.668
the Communist parties in the United States out of 
Washington, D.C. Marcus Lennon group out of

41:19.340 --> 41:41.668
Washington, D.C. Mousetongues out of Chicago, 
the same types that created the disturbance at

41:41.902 --> 41:52.159
Kent State and were all buried back in Chicago when 
that one blew, remember? Well, I had put the word

41:53.201 --> 42:00.713
out that I wouldn't tolerate any of this crap, 
communist crap. It wasn't going to happen, by God,

42:02.556 --> 42:06.222
and that No Jane Fondas are going to visit. She had 
been on several Army posts and tried to get along,

42:10.337 --> 42:21.812
but I said, in one Army post, that the 
Communist-inspired elements are not going to

42:10.337 --> 42:21.812
interfere with. And I said, there isn't any damn 
question about this. And I wanted it to be known

42:27.319 --> 42:30.583
publicly, and it wasn't known publicly. Well, 
somehow or another, five of these guys showed up

42:30.664 --> 42:35.550
there Were they recruits or were they just? They 
were in advance training. They had created

42:43.252 --> 43:07.596
disturbances at other places and instead of the 
Army taking action, you had some weak goddamn

42:43.252 --> 43:07.596
commanders as you have in all walks of life that 
were more interested in themselves and weren't

42:43.252 --> 43:07.596
interested in creating any, taking any action to 
do something, you know, when action was required.

43:08.437 --> 43:11.101
So they keep passing these jokers along. Instead 
of killing the goddamn snake, you just chase him

43:11.221 --> 43:17.150
off out of this bunch of woods into another one, you 
see. I like to kill a son of a bitch when you've got a

43:17.170 --> 43:21.596
goddamn rattlesnake. Don't chase him over 
another guy's yard. So they chased about five of

43:25.382 --> 43:32.132
them into my yard, and that's where they made their 
damn mistake. What'd they do? Well, they tried to

43:34.300 --> 44:01.495
create a revolt and revolution one evening down 
between the two barracks out making speeches, you

43:34.300 --> 44:01.495
know, about about how bad Vietnam was and this is 
not a democracy and you got your rights and this

43:34.300 --> 44:01.495
that and the other and all this horseshit and so I 
just sent the MPs down and I said lock those

43:34.300 --> 44:01.495
communist bastards up which they did and then I 
started action to court-martial them and press

44:01.812 --> 44:09.619
got in the act. ACLU got in the act.

44:14.844 --> 44:19.548
Their ACLU lawyer, we were denying their rights 
and so on and so forth. Make a long story short, I

44:20.689 --> 44:30.958
court-martialed them in a closed court and the New 
York Times came down and wanting to attend the

44:31.259 --> 44:34.223
trial. I said, apparently you people are stupider 
than I think you are, or maybe you're in the same

44:35.905 --> 44:52.568
category as these fellows, but since you can't 
read and write, maybe I better tell you that I said

44:35.905 --> 44:52.568
the court was closed. And they're not going to be 
tried in a newspaper. They're going to be tried in a

44:55.031 --> 44:57.655
legal court. That's what I told the goddamn 
reporter from New York Times. He went back to

45:03.263 --> 45:09.953
Washington and went up to see a guy named Laird, who 
was a politician, Secretary of Defense. And Laird

45:09.993 --> 45:19.426
sent him down to the PIO, the Public Information 
Officer, Assistant Secretary, I think his name

45:09.993 --> 45:19.426
was Ross. And then Ross, he calls the Army, and then 
the Army...
