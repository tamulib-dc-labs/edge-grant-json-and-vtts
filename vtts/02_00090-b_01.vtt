00:03.237 --> 00:24.318
The Chevrolet Motor Division had a 
representative that would visit all the dealers,

00:03.237 --> 00:24.318
General Motors dealers, and he would check or spot 
check the defective parts and the forms that were

00:03.237 --> 00:24.318
necessary, and he'd put his name on there and okay 
it. And I said, well, hell, I can do that.

00:32.701 --> 00:36.707
They had a representative that came down from 
Chevrolet Motor Division. His name was Sam O.

00:37.989 --> 00:41.894
Smith, SOS. And some of those guys there, they 
chased that same old, you know, four-letter word.

00:50.227 --> 00:52.430
And he was a nice chap. He talked to the people 
working in the parts department and everything.

00:56.516 --> 00:58.759
So I put him over to the side and I said, I'd like to 
have a job like this fellow's got that checks out

00:59.532 --> 01:05.037
these defective points. Like, you know, I've been 
here a long time, and I know that. And he says, yeah,

01:08.640 --> 01:22.452
I can understand that, but it's the policy with 
General Motors that we have somebody like that

01:08.640 --> 01:22.452
that has a traveling job. He's got to be a college 
graduate. I said, well. Why does it have to be a

01:29.418 --> 01:31.120
college graduate? He says, well, I don't need to 
know. I said, but that's the policy. And we won't

01:36.664 --> 01:40.107
consider anybody unless they got a college 
degree. I said, well, I guess I'll have to get a

01:41.569 --> 01:49.636
college degree if I want to get a job that is 
worthwhile. And that's what got me started,

01:49.676 --> 01:57.703
wanting to get me a college degree. And then the two 
of my wife's brothers who were coming over, who

01:58.814 --> 02:14.121
were attending A&M, my wife told them about my 
conversation with Sam O. Smith. And so they

02:15.324 --> 02:18.008
encouraged me. They said, well, if you're going to 
go to college, come to A&M. A&M will give what you

02:23.840 --> 02:34.997
need, and if

02:23.840 --> 02:34.997
you've got the ability, you've got the know-how, 
you can make it. And the degree from A&M is worth a

02:35.417 --> 02:39.664
lot. It's recognized. I said, well, that's what 
I'll do.

02:47.127 --> 02:54.137
So, I told, I told Rachel about it, and she agreed, 
and that's where I started there.

02:57.541 --> 02:59.945
Did, did anyone discourage you? Was there anyone 
that? Well, yeah. Well, there was this parts

03:03.850 --> 03:09.598
manager. I was making $300 a month. At that time, it 
was a good trade. And I had a position in back of the

03:18.526 --> 03:25.035
parts department facing the shop. And I wasn't 
waiting on the general trade. I was a mechanics

03:30.423 --> 03:32.266
parts man. I waited on them because before, the 
mechanic would have to go out to the front and wait

03:32.907 --> 03:39.797
in line, you know, until you got to it. And the boss 
didn't like that. He says, these mechanics, they

03:41.985 --> 03:44.909
got to make a living. They can't be out there 
wasting their time waiting. We need a man in the

03:47.172 --> 03:48.634
back window. And that was my job. So I told my boss 
that I wanted to go to college and I needed to take

03:51.298 --> 04:00.232
two summer courses. And he was very nice. He let me 
go to class in the morning and get back over there

04:03.376 --> 04:08.063
and work in my back window. And so I was offered a 
raise if I would forget paying him. He says, we'll

04:18.841 --> 04:22.906
pay you $400 a month if you stay. And $400 a month at 
that time was good pay, see? And I turned it down.

04:33.838 --> 04:35.039
And I said, oh. He was very disappointed. I said, 
okay, okay, good luck. And we were pretty good

04:40.508 --> 04:43.892
friends. All right, so with the G.I. Bill then, you 
came up here to visit A&M. Do you remember who you

04:49.879 --> 04:51.421
talked to? Did you talk to Mr. Heaton? No, it was 
another man. Another man who was a tall, slender

04:57.308 --> 04:59.571
fellow.

05:03.576 --> 05:04.757
He wasn't a registrar. It was somebody else that 
was reviewing on the scripts from these people.

05:09.995 --> 05:16.562
And he was the one that told me, he says, you need to 
brush up on chemistry and math. And that's about

05:16.582 --> 05:17.283
it. I said, OK. So you went back to take those at San 
Antonio College? San Antonio Junior College,

05:23.309 --> 05:25.771
yes, sir. And so I got that ready, got that put away. 
And then I had to take this test. All the students

05:38.037 --> 05:49.569
who were coming to A&M, especially the veterans, 
they had to take this test. And it was supposed to be

05:50.430 --> 05:58.197
the equivalent to the test given all freshmen at 
Ohio State University. It says, if you can pass

05:58.217 --> 06:04.804
that test, they're not telling us whether you're 
going to be able to do the work or not. I took it and I

06:06.353 --> 06:07.895
passed it. Then I had to go to the Veterans 
Administration and tell them, hey, the skids are

06:08.656 --> 06:14.865
greased. Wait a minute. You got to take a test over 
here. Another one, see. Similar to this one. Well,

06:22.855 --> 06:24.037
I passed that one, too. Then they went ahead and 
gave you the green light or something. All right.

06:29.304 --> 06:31.407
And then you came up here looking for housing. Oh, 
yes. And couldn't find anything? No. Oh, there was

06:35.986 --> 06:41.513
a, it was a college then. The college didn't have 
those facilities, see. And then all these

06:45.398 --> 06:47.320
veterans started coming in. And, boy, they were 
coming from everywhere. And so there was a

06:52.306 --> 06:57.673
project.

06:58.328 --> 07:04.618
They were building this village right next to the 
car field. And it had a sign on there that it was

07:04.638 --> 07:11.369
being built for the veterans, returning 
veterans. And it was portable barracks. And they

07:16.558 --> 07:21.566
put a wall in the middle and set up for two families. 
They furnished a refrigerator, a cooking stove,

07:25.902 --> 07:29.827
two beds, and all in a line. But you couldn't get one 
of those at first? When you first- No, no, no. What

07:37.417 --> 07:43.125
was your wife's feeling about your leaving your 
job and going back to college? She was all for it.

07:48.112 --> 07:52.838
She knew that this was, it was more education for 
me. And it would help me. And her father, Rachel's

07:55.745 --> 08:10.762
father, believed in education because he came 
from Mexico, and the school facilities there were

07:55.745 --> 08:10.762
nonexistent. And he knew that if you didn't have an 
education, all you could be was a cotton picker,

08:10.782 --> 08:18.651
say, or a grave digger. And he stressed education 
to his 14 children. before they all got a college

08:22.805 --> 08:25.968
education. So my wife says, I haven't got all my 
education, but I want it and I want to get it some

08:26.388 --> 08:32.574
way. And so she encouraged me to go. So you came up 
here in the fall of 1949? Yes. And how did you, did

08:41.723 --> 08:44.526
you drive up in your car? Yes. What did you bring 
with you? What kind of belongings? What clothing

08:48.250 --> 08:49.491
and everything? Well, there wasn't much to talk 
about. I had just regular civilian clothes and I,

08:52.640 --> 09:08.343
there was at the time, first of all they didn't have 
the room, you know. And secondly, I was always

09:08.403 --> 09:20.301
harassing the freshmen at the annex or at the Brown 
Air Force Base. a great number of vacant military

09:20.686 --> 09:26.033
barracks. And that's where we were at. Now they had 
all the veterans in one area, and all the regular

09:28.737 --> 09:39.552
high school kids had just got out in another area, 
and the band had another area. About how many

09:40.013 --> 09:44.059
veterans were there? Well, there was about three. 
three barracks and there was about ten, twenty,

09:46.387 --> 10:01.169
there must have been about between forty and fifty 
veterans. Right. And did you all live in bunks or

10:02.391 --> 10:06.898
did you have separate rooms? No, no. There was no? 
No, we had what do you call them? upper no yeah two

10:14.095 --> 10:35.547
bucks did you veterans chuckle that this was like 
going back to the war uh because you'd been through

10:14.095 --> 10:35.547
no it was a matter of fact uh they didn't like to 
discuss it you know and uh so we never talked about

10:14.095 --> 10:35.547
it you know we just had to study and there was no uh No 
time to shoot the bull. Did you, did you wear

10:39.028 --> 10:41.090
uniforms? No. Or you veterans wore civilian 
clothes? That's right. They figured that we had

10:45.053 --> 10:47.495
already served. But, but I wanted to wear, I wanted 
to get into the Corps of Cadets. And at that time,

10:55.983 --> 11:05.972
they wanted students to get into the Corps and then 
eventually get their commission as second

10:55.983 --> 11:05.972
lieutenants. Well, I never dreamed of that. I just 
wanted to be in the Corps, and I wanted to wear boots

11:08.045 --> 11:12.291
in my senior year. So I went to see Colonel Volkner, 
Hayden L. Volkner. I says, Colonel, I like the

11:17.459 --> 11:21.524
Corps, and I'd like to get in. Well, he says, how old 
are you? I'm 32.

11:29.290 --> 11:30.791
I don't think it would get you in. See, he was 
thinking of the commission. I wasn't. But I was too

11:34.515 --> 11:37.138
dumb to tell him, I don't want no commission. I just 
want to be in the Corps. He says, we're going to

11:39.800 --> 11:42.183
Fourth Army. I want to get, see if I can get you a 
waiver. Well, about a couple of weeks later, he

11:45.586 --> 11:50.811
said, nope. Go see Colonel Boat. And he says, I'm 
sorry, but I've got a response to my letter, and it

11:56.003 --> 12:03.230
says that it would not be in the best interest of the 
Army. I'm sorry. So I thanked him and went out. And

12:09.115 --> 12:17.562
then

12:09.115 --> 12:17.562
there was some guys from Mexico, and they were in 
the band. And since they were Mexican citizens,

12:19.684 --> 12:26.010
they couldn't qualify for commissions. How the 
hell did you get into the court?" I said, no, we're

12:29.106 --> 12:32.531
not in the court, we're in the band. And then we get 
to wear the uniform. I said, I wish I had known how to

12:34.875 --> 12:39.101
play an instrument or something. So they were in 
the court, so to speak, by being in the band and

12:39.642 --> 12:49.276
playing an instrument. And I noticed there were 
students from just about everywhere. I mean,

12:53.480 --> 12:54.742
foreign countries. And there was, I remember the 
people from India, they had the wives, you know,

12:55.864 --> 13:07.065
and they, you know, of course there were, what do 
you call it? I don't know, that little dot on their

13:07.626 --> 13:09.350
forehead. It's a dot. Okay. And so we befriended a 
couple of those fellas. And

13:15.755 --> 13:25.265
there were students majoring in some form of 
agriculture. Now, what did you plan to major in

13:26.666 --> 13:30.170
when you got here? I was going to go take agronomy. 
Agronomy? Agronomy, none of the husbandry. And

13:37.797 --> 13:40.981
what were you planning, what were you dreaming of 
doing when you graduated? Well, either work for

13:41.681 --> 13:44.344
A&M, or be placed in one of these experimental 
stations. Because you didn't plan to be a rancher

13:50.166 --> 13:53.610
yourself. No, no, no, no. I had no ranching 
experience. Describe the route. As you move in,

14:01.019 --> 14:07.006
did anybody attempt to haze you veterans? No. They 
left you all alone? No, as a matter of fact, As a

14:12.573 --> 14:19.443
matter of fact, I befriended all those freshman 
cadets. And some of them would like to take off on

14:21.125 --> 14:28.375
like a Saturday night or Sunday and tank up on beer. 
They had to get across the bridge, remember?

14:31.399 --> 14:32.701
Worcester Bridge? And they'd say, hey, Gunsy, you 
don't drink deal. I said, no, I don't drink deal.

14:41.108 --> 14:44.272
listen, you want to go out and will you drive us 
back? Yeah. So I got in with them, see? And it was

14:48.658 --> 14:57.571
then that I learned that they kept these old 
quizzes in those little apple boxes, see? So I had

14:57.591 --> 15:00.415
access to those, see? That's a pretty good swamp. 
That was a good swamp, see? So whenever we were

15:05.462 --> 15:09.968
going, we were having, let's take American 
history. have an A quiz. Well we don't know what the

15:13.108 --> 15:15.011
Pope's going to ask. And I forget the

15:15.331 --> 15:21.139
professor's name. And they had them by names you 
see. This is the test that this professor. So we

15:28.929 --> 15:30.171
reviewed them. And we'd get together at the table 
somewhere and we'd mention these things. Well

15:35.778 --> 15:36.840
he's going to ask this. He said this, he's going to 
ask that. And we were ready, you see, for when the

15:40.525 --> 15:45.813
time came to go to class. And he would pass the forms 
out, and we were ready for them. Describe class

15:51.961 --> 15:54.104
day. What time did you all get up? What did you do? 
Describe the whole day.

16:05.240 --> 16:09.366
Was there a Reveille bugle that woke you up? No. No, 
we had alarm clocks. I'm talking about the annex.

16:15.811 --> 16:19.197
We had an alarm clock. And I don't remember, I'm 
talking about the veterans. Now they had a church

16:26.027 --> 16:36.283
of quarters or somebody over there in the,

16:26.027 --> 16:36.283
the other regular students, that would cause them 
to get up early and so forth. But over here with the

16:41.588 --> 16:44.872
veterans, we just had our alarm clocks. And let's 
see, you had a gang shower? A what? A gang shower.

16:49.597 --> 16:50.879
You didn't have a private shower. Oh, yeah, yeah, a 
gang shower, yeah. And we had a row of commodes.

17:00.349 --> 17:02.592
You remember those pot crackers? whistle, you got 
a name for it but I won't give it to you, you know. And

17:08.378 --> 17:14.546
here we're sitting on the stool, you know, and some 
ugly guy had the light running through him. Oh, I

17:16.388 --> 17:18.250
tell you it was something. Who did that? I don't 
know. And yes, we had regular All right, so you'd

17:24.492 --> 17:32.542
get up, eat breakfast, then go to class, and you had 
class all morning. Yes. What did you all do in the

17:34.745 --> 17:36.347
afternoons? Study. Where did you study? Either 
there or they had a place, a barracks, where it was

17:39.611 --> 17:48.782
called study hall. But now you didn't have any 
private room. Oh, no. Nothing was private. And you

17:53.803 --> 17:57.307
hung your, where did you hang your clothes? Well, 
we had a laundry, see, and we sent it out. But did you

18:03.553 --> 18:09.320
have a locker to hang your clothes in as a kind of a 
closet? No, it was just a rack. Oh, okay. And a pipe

18:12.863 --> 18:15.486
going through and hangers. But it wasn't closed up 
so you couldn't lock it? No, we had a footlocker

18:18.309 --> 18:21.853
that you could, we had a padlock. Then at night, 
where did y'all study? In the same place, same

18:28.485 --> 18:31.708
study hall. And what did you and your friends do if 
you wanted to relax at night? Where did you go for a

18:38.594 --> 18:39.915
good time?

18:42.718 --> 18:44.559
Well, there wasn't a good time. It would be either 
down to Bryan or Caldwell. And what would you all do

18:52.192 --> 18:54.315
in Caldwell? Well, it was wide open. And they just 
did about anything. But they stayed together. And

19:02.967 --> 19:08.134
they would go from one tavern to another. Did you 
make some good friends that year? Oh, yes. Give

19:14.863 --> 19:21.793
some examples of the friendship that you all 
enjoyed.

19:23.056 --> 19:30.428
there was this student who was Jewish, and his name 
was Dennerstein. He was from Houston. And I think

19:34.034 --> 19:43.028
his mother had a photo shop, and they had a lot of 
picture frames and all this. And I remember when we

19:43.369 --> 19:47.055
were or the freshmen, they would be given a little 
booklet with some ticket stubs. That was a stub you

19:56.686 --> 20:01.112
had to turn in to get into the mess hall to eat. So, 
there was some people that didn't want to go eat in

20:01.132 --> 20:11.024
the mess hall, and they'd go to a little snack bar 
that was there, and give them tickets. And on

20:11.885 --> 20:13.347
Thursdays we had liver. I'd be sitting next to the 
dentist and he'd say, I do. Are you going to eat your

20:19.793 --> 20:20.835
liver? No. He'd get it for anybody else without a 
fart. And he had three or four big chunks of liver.

20:28.886 --> 20:29.968
I'll never forget that. And when he'd go on leave, 
go home to visit, he'd come back to his barracks.

20:38.588 --> 20:42.853
and somebody had already taken his mattress out 
and hid it somewhere. Just pranks, you know. So we

20:46.057 --> 20:47.519
were good friends. Then there was Martin Cain. He 
was from, what was it, I think it was Blue Shoe,

20:50.963 --> 20:55.249
Texas. And they had gone out on a binge on it, and 
they got drunk. And after it was over, one of the

21:08.322 --> 21:10.965
girls was found to be pregnant. And she said it was 
Martin Kane. And Martin says, hey, it wasn't me. I

21:16.631 --> 21:19.153
was passed out. And so

21:19.173 --> 21:24.679
the gross father found out about it. And then he 
came over there to the annex with two guys. I think

21:32.567 --> 21:33.528
they were brothers. And they went in the barracks 
and took Martin Kane. by force. And it took them a

21:41.101 --> 21:43.564
long time to get her married. Oh, brother. So then, 
I don't know, the military department got wind of

21:46.427 --> 21:52.615
it. I don't know what they did. It was too late. It 
was fixed already. But the girl said, I don't want

21:57.381 --> 22:01.846
nothing. I just want to give the baby a name. was 
already scheduled. I say scheduled. He was going

22:10.039 --> 22:12.504
to marry a girl already. And good night. The girl 
found out about what had happened, and that

22:16.151 --> 22:22.443
wedding was just below proportion. And he 
finished his first year, but he didn't come back

22:23.806 --> 22:28.515
the second year. So he disappeared. The last I 
heard, he went out with a close friend of his that

22:32.382 --> 22:36.829
was a driller. But he didn't drill for oil. He 
drilled for water wells. I don't know, whatever.

22:45.222 --> 22:49.568
And then, let me see, he was born in King, and...

22:53.334 --> 22:57.540
I'm just about to...

22:58.246 --> 23:00.549
There were the Casa twins. They were from Laredo. 
Casa? Caso. Caso. C-A-S-S-O.

23:09.481 --> 23:13.186
And their parents had a wholesale grocery 
business. You know, they had a big warehouse, and

23:14.208 --> 23:18.794
they would supply their grocery. And they were 
twins. And they were always doing something out of

23:20.977 --> 23:24.602
the ordinary. And they'd get drowned out. You know 
what I mean? Okay. And I'll never forget that. We

23:33.510 --> 23:35.733
were friends, you know, but not close. Then there 
was Organdigie from Laredo. And his daddy had a

23:41.800 --> 23:45.244
wholesale oil operation. He was a dealer, and he 
supplied service stations with oil. And so, we

23:51.230 --> 23:55.455
weren't trouble. Good friends, and that's... Did 
those young Aggie freshmen right out of high

23:55.891 --> 24:08.004
school ever turn to you older guys for advice? No. 
Not me anyway. So you veterans kind of stuck

24:13.470 --> 24:22.600
together, and who were some of the teachers, 
counselors from that first year that you

24:13.470 --> 24:22.600
remember? Well, it was Boss Hamilton. Dirty shirt 
Nelson. Screaming owl. Screaming owl Nelson. Oh,

24:32.567 --> 24:35.433
let me see. Oh, gosh. Did you have Happy Harry 
Hearth in English? No. Harrison Hearth? No. This

24:45.953 --> 24:46.815
was a man. Well, yeah. I can't think of his name 
right now. It escapes me. What were the toughest

24:55.693 --> 24:59.158
courses that first year for you? That first year, 
the toughest was math.

25:11.596 --> 25:12.698
But you passed everything. Yes. Passed 
everything. Oh, yeah. How often did you go back

25:15.682 --> 25:20.269
home to San Antonio?

25:21.312 --> 25:22.894
I didn't have a set. Whenever the opportunity 
arose, I would go. Usually, like every other

25:26.959 --> 25:42.416
weekend, and I'd leave like on Saturday afternoon 
and get back Sunday, Sunday night. So I had to go

25:42.697 --> 25:44.719
Monday class. Did you go to Aggie football games 
that freshman, that first year? No. So you didn't

25:50.692 --> 25:53.595
get involved in the... I didn't get involved, no. 
Was there a,

25:55.777 --> 26:02.465
let's see, a bonfire? Did you help? No. That first 
year, no. We were confined, to lack of a better

26:06.169 --> 26:10.994
word, to the annex. And no silver taps? No silver 
taps, no. Not until my wife joined me later. Then I

26:18.241 --> 26:19.703
would get a a ticket or two to maybe go to one or two 
games and uh. Right and so you did well that first

26:26.331 --> 26:33.042
year and then that that next summer what did you do 
in the summer of 1950? Did you go back to work or? Oh

26:35.006 --> 26:35.226
yeah. Yes sir. Yeah I had to build on that um yeah 
I've been I had a wife and I had a little boy, and so.

26:50.369 --> 26:54.576
Right, so then you came back here with your wife in 
the fall of 1950. How did y'all locate, how were you

26:56.419 --> 27:02.288
able to get that apartment over in College View? 
What did you have to go through to? I didn't, I just,

27:06.435 --> 27:09.079
you know, applied and uh they said uh we've got a 
place for you over there at the college view would

27:09.413 --> 27:31.911
you like that hey yeah it's very good what i'm 
living in over here so uh it was it was better and so

27:09.413 --> 27:31.911
you you brought her and how old was your youngster 
then oh he was uh Close to five. Okay. And what

27:34.656 --> 27:36.098
furniture did you bring? None. None. None. Oh, it 
was furnished? Yeah. Oh. Yeah, yeah. You see, we

27:41.063 --> 27:42.124
had two beds. We had a refrigerator. We had a stove. 
And

27:47.129 --> 27:56.599
there were showers in there, and so we, it was, We 
didn't go for the sofas and fancy. Just the bare

28:01.797 --> 28:03.338
necessities. All right. Did you sell your house in 
San Antonio? Yes. Yeah, I had bought a house, a

28:07.402 --> 28:23.958
small frame house in San Antonio, and got a bank 
loan, which was authorized by the VA, and it was at

28:07.402 --> 28:23.958
four percent interest. Unheard of. When you sold 
that house and came here, do you remember how much

28:26.228 --> 28:33.157
money you brought with you that second year? No, I 
don't remember exactly how much. I must have had

28:38.444 --> 28:43.130
about $400 or $500, something like that. And the 
rent at College View was $30? Yeah, $30 a month. Did

28:47.796 --> 28:49.138
that include utilities? Yes. Yes. All right, so 
you moved in. How soon before you all made friends

28:53.722 --> 28:57.047
with your neighbors? Almost immediately. 
Everybody was friendly and everybody that was

29:01.774 --> 29:08.865
there was there for the same purpose that I was 
there. Hey, we're in the same boat, so let's...

29:14.353 --> 29:15.895
Describe some of them. Because I'm assuming this 
was a very, in today's words, a diverse group of

29:15.976 --> 29:21.523
people. Well, you could call it that. We didn't 
pick the barracks. We didn't pick the friends. He

29:30.655 --> 29:38.305
says, you go to barracks number so-and-so, and you 
take apartment so-and-so, which is upstairs or

29:30.655 --> 29:38.305
downstairs. So it just happened that the 
immediate friends there their husbands were

29:45.625 --> 29:54.775
studying to be a doctor of veterinary medicine, 
vets. And this building that when you're coming in

29:56.096 --> 30:07.268
and you turn around, used to be the U.S. Department 
of Agriculture, now it's got another name. And

30:07.288 --> 30:13.675
there used to be one of those vet majors that was He 
did janitor work in that building, and I wanted

30:14.600 --> 30:21.166
that job because he was ready to graduate. Now I 
already had this plan, somebody else is going to

30:21.987 --> 30:26.631
have it. And so these veterans,

30:26.651 --> 30:33.457
all they did was study. They had no place. And there 
was Louis Springer. He was from Virginia.

30:45.734 --> 30:54.745
I'll tell you about this.

30:58.750 --> 31:01.734
Lewis Springer, Wallace Lawson, Everett Beach. 
Yeah, Wallace Lawson, Houston, San Antonio, and

31:01.754 --> 31:07.040
Everett D. Besch. That guy, he had a cubby hole in 
his apartment. And he was there all the time,

31:13.595 --> 31:21.065
except when he was going to go eat or go to the 
bathroom. He went there to study? I went there to

31:23.133 --> 31:24.077
study.
