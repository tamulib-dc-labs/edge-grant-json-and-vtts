00:00:02.292 --> 00:00:28.384
21st i believe in a conference room on the first floor of the new reed arena chatting with mary helen bowers and mary helen use your mic now let's be sure they're both working this is mary helen bowers strangers may use this material in decades to come so would you begin please by giving a

00:00:28.853 --> 00:00:33.859
Brief biographical summary before you came to Texas A&M in 1964.

00:00:33.880 --> 00:00:34.380
1964.

00:00:35.201 --> 00:00:42.130
Well, I'm a native Texan, grew up, was born and reared in Beeville, Texas, South Texas.

00:00:43.892 --> 00:00:46.696
I moved here in 1964 as a young faculty wife.

00:00:46.976 --> 00:00:48.178
I was 24 years old.

00:00:50.622 --> 00:00:52.805
I had one very small son at the time.

00:00:54.186 --> 00:01:01.054
I later had two additional sons, reared them here, and it was a great place to raise kids.

00:01:02.276 --> 00:01:17.153
I was fortunate, I think, to be able to stay home with them until my youngest son entered school, and by that time I was doing about 30 hours a week of volunteer work, church work, and other things, and it occurred to me that somebody might pay me for

00:01:18.010 --> 00:01:28.481
what I was doing and started looking for a job on campus and was fortunate enough to find one and started working here in 1973.

00:01:28.681 --> 00:01:28.842
Right.

00:01:30.323 --> 00:01:35.068
Now, you came to A&M because your husband was employed.

00:01:35.229 --> 00:01:36.270
A new faculty member.

00:01:36.290 --> 00:01:37.731
New faculty member in journalism.

00:01:38.852 --> 00:01:40.694
And you all moved here from Lubbock.

00:01:40.995 --> 00:01:41.195
No.

00:01:41.595 --> 00:01:44.018
We moved here from Media, Pennsylvania.

00:01:45.179 --> 00:01:47.523
You had gone to Tech.

00:01:47.923 --> 00:01:49.085
Well, I went to Texas Tech.

00:01:49.766 --> 00:01:55.996
And he came in journalism, and for trivia information, what was his beginning salary?

00:01:57.137 --> 00:01:57.438
Here?

00:01:57.778 --> 00:01:58.019
Here.

00:01:58.700 --> 00:01:59.161
Do you remember?

00:01:59.181 --> 00:02:02.065
I actually don't.

00:02:02.486 --> 00:02:06.973
If I were going to have to make a guess, I want to think it was like $9,000 a year or something like that.

00:02:06.993 --> 00:02:08.795
And do you remember what his rank was?

00:02:08.836 --> 00:02:09.537
Oh, yes.

00:02:09.697 --> 00:02:11.119
He was an associate professor.

00:02:11.774 --> 00:02:19.100
And we're not going to concentrate on the journalism faculty very much, but where was journalism housed then?

00:02:19.221 --> 00:02:20.502
In the basement of Nagel Hall.

00:02:21.763 --> 00:02:35.315
And when one of his colleagues joined the department a couple of years later, on his very first day here, a skunk got caught in the window well right outside Skip Lebo's office.

00:02:35.335 --> 00:02:39.779
And the faculty when your husband got here in journalism was how many?

00:02:40.179 --> 00:02:41.140
There were...

00:02:43.820 --> 00:02:46.402
three of them, and one of them was on leave.

00:02:47.824 --> 00:02:52.127
And a full class load for a faculty member, David taught four courses.

00:02:55.610 --> 00:03:00.154
You had not, you were not thoroughly familiar with College Station when you all moved.

00:03:00.635 --> 00:03:01.896
No, I'd never been here.

00:03:01.916 --> 00:03:05.919
Describe your first impressions of College Station Bryan.

00:03:07.581 --> 00:03:13.506
Well, the big decision then was whether you wanted to live in Bryan or College Station.

00:03:15.342 --> 00:03:20.312
College Station even was considered far more liberal than Bryan.

00:03:22.055 --> 00:03:26.804
There were not as many places to live in College Station.

00:03:27.486 --> 00:03:33.958
There had been some fairly recent housing developments in Bryan, but not as many.

00:03:34.546 --> 00:03:59.440
there were almost no houses to rent uh we looked at my mother and i came up about a month and a half or two months before we moved i was visiting in beeville and we looked at i believe there were three rental houses period and none of them were what we had in mind at all

00:04:00.196 --> 00:04:07.765
When we moved here, we got very, very fortunate in that we showed up and were in a motel room.

00:04:07.846 --> 00:04:12.832
We thought the furniture was coming three days later, and we had three days to find a place to live in August.

00:04:14.534 --> 00:04:18.659
And David had gone down to deposit a check at the bank to pay the movers.

00:04:20.381 --> 00:04:23.024
And the lady at the bank heard we were looking for a house.

00:04:23.084 --> 00:04:26.168
She told a real estate agent who came in after us.

00:04:26.228 --> 00:04:29.933
The real estate agent knocked on the motel room door, said, I've got a house for you.

00:04:31.432 --> 00:04:34.222
And we bought the house.

00:04:34.443 --> 00:04:38.337
The people had lived in it 18 months.

00:04:39.802 --> 00:04:41.904
All they wanted out of it was a real estate fee.

00:04:41.944 --> 00:04:43.005
We picked up the payments.

00:04:43.065 --> 00:04:44.267
We moved in that house for $750.

00:04:45.147 --> 00:04:51.374
Signed the papers at 9 o'clock on a Saturday night in the real estate agent's office.

00:04:52.195 --> 00:05:00.203
And then that couple had loaded their furniture that day, and then the four of us went swimming at the motel pool that night to celebrate.

00:05:00.804 --> 00:05:02.185
This was in Bryan or College Station?

00:05:02.505 --> 00:05:03.887
It was in Bryan.

00:05:03.907 --> 00:05:05.268
It was in Bryan.

00:05:05.288 --> 00:05:09.032
And we lived there for, oh,

00:05:11.223 --> 00:05:12.629
till 73 also.

00:05:14.596 --> 00:05:19.596
The, how did you, you get here just before school starts.

00:05:20.487 --> 00:05:25.274
Was there anything for any activities, as you remember, for new faculty?

00:05:25.354 --> 00:05:27.177
Oh, yes, and for faculty-wise.

00:05:28.158 --> 00:05:41.158
It was still had many aspects of a much of a small school, and it was a small school, and that the social life more nearly revolved around.

00:05:41.819 --> 00:05:46.005
There was always, and for a number of years, I'm not sure when they stopped it,

00:05:45.985 --> 00:06:02.897
I was actually kind of relieved, but there was always a reception held at the start of school, and we thought at least that it was a command performance that everyone would show up and go through this humongously long receiving line.

00:06:03.316 --> 00:06:31.247
shaking hands with every all of the with the president the vice presidents the deans and all of their wives and uh there were literally it seemed like 20 30 people in the line then there was the social club which was essentially the faculty wives club technically you could be a professional female employee and be a member but i don't think there were any

00:06:31.413 --> 00:06:58.078
and at that time at least people wore hats and gloves to those meetings and gee they were boring now they did have special interest groups those were a lot more fun and one of them was for newcomers which was primarily a younger group and those were a lot more fun and they had a bridge group and i thoroughly enjoyed that but i think you tended to kind of make friends in the smaller groups missed out if you didn't

00:06:59.324 --> 00:07:00.525
Did you participate in the newcomers?

00:07:00.666 --> 00:07:01.466
Oh, yeah.

00:07:01.486 --> 00:07:03.649
And did it help a newcomer?

00:07:03.789 --> 00:07:04.230
Very much.

00:07:04.250 --> 00:07:04.850
Make friends and so on?

00:07:04.910 --> 00:07:05.391
Very much.

00:07:06.532 --> 00:07:12.719
It was that, and like I say, in the bridge group and things like that, they were helpful.

00:07:12.839 --> 00:07:24.813
Between that and church and neighbors, it was pretty easy to make friends, even though David was in a very small department, and we didn't have, that was an unusual group.

00:07:25.534 --> 00:07:29.078
Did the department do anything socially?

00:07:30.155 --> 00:07:30.896
Occasionally.

00:07:30.936 --> 00:07:36.766
There were efforts made from time to time.

00:07:37.967 --> 00:07:44.538
What did you get the impression was almost a command involvement for a young faculty wife?

00:07:46.160 --> 00:07:50.728
You needed to be nice to the department head's wife and to the dean and the dean's wife.

00:07:51.028 --> 00:07:57.799
Beyond that, you could pretty much be anonymous if you wanted to, unless you met them somewhere else.

00:07:58.083 --> 00:07:59.865
Now, Skip Lebo was the department head then?

00:07:59.925 --> 00:08:00.686
Not at that time.

00:08:00.726 --> 00:08:01.587
Skip came in later.

00:08:02.588 --> 00:08:02.788
All right.

00:08:02.808 --> 00:08:03.028
Who was he?

00:08:03.409 --> 00:08:04.230
Delbert McGuire.

00:08:05.231 --> 00:08:05.551
Delbert McGuire.

00:08:05.571 --> 00:08:06.352
Yes.

00:08:06.372 --> 00:08:08.234
He was comparatively low-key, wasn't he?

00:08:11.597 --> 00:08:18.985
Delbert... Haskell, when are you turning this over to anyone, the tape?

00:08:20.667 --> 00:08:23.010
I mean, that's, you know, it's not opinion.

00:08:25.412 --> 00:08:27.955
Mention, summarize the story about...

00:08:28.559 --> 00:08:32.729
Professor McGuire's resignation?

00:08:32.969 --> 00:08:42.872
The dean at that time was Frank W. R. Hubert, who was an interesting fellow for lots of reasons, and I still consider him a friend.

00:08:44.877 --> 00:08:52.585
We had realized, my husband had realized, that Dean Hubert was on the department head's case big time.

00:08:53.146 --> 00:08:56.890
He was not approving anything that was proposed.

00:08:56.970 --> 00:08:59.612
He was being particularly hard on the department.

00:08:59.652 --> 00:09:02.575
He was asking for things that were difficult.

00:09:02.836 --> 00:09:04.457
I mean, he was just really on it.

00:09:05.559 --> 00:09:11.745
And Dr. Hubert later told the story that Delbert McGuire came in to complain to him.

00:09:12.434 --> 00:09:39.420
and legitimately of all the hardships he was having to endure because for reasons he didn't understand and he finally told hubert that well i came in here to tell you i was thinking about resigning and dean hubert said i accept and he reached in his desk drawer and pulled out a written letter of resignation handed it to delbert with a pen and said sign it and he did and that was it um

00:09:40.244 --> 00:09:44.468
Let's see, you have a one-year-old when you all arrive, you have a one-year-old?

00:09:44.488 --> 00:09:45.709
I have a 10-month-old, yes.

00:09:45.729 --> 00:09:46.370
10-month-old.

00:09:47.551 --> 00:09:53.397
And your husband teaching four courses, four sections, and probably four preparations.

00:09:53.417 --> 00:09:54.158
Four different courses.

00:09:54.278 --> 00:09:55.299
Yeah, four different courses.

00:09:55.859 --> 00:09:56.981
So he's busy.

00:09:57.141 --> 00:09:59.984
The journalism department's too small to have multiple sections of a course.

00:10:00.484 --> 00:10:06.470
What was a typical day for you that first year, a typical work day?

00:10:06.670 --> 00:10:07.551
What time were you off?

00:10:08.172 --> 00:10:11.301
We would get up about 6.30 to 7.

00:10:13.086 --> 00:10:15.252
I would cook breakfast, it seemed, for about an hour.

00:10:16.937 --> 00:10:19.424
It got worse when I had two smaller ones.

00:10:20.106 --> 00:10:22.553
We would, we had one car.

00:10:24.035 --> 00:10:33.265
Generally, David would take the car and go to campus, and I was left with the baby to figure out what I was going to do that day.

00:10:33.885 --> 00:10:37.930
Keeping house for three people, as I learned when it was five people, isn't difficult.

00:10:39.651 --> 00:10:40.332
Play with the baby.

00:10:40.352 --> 00:10:42.154
It was a wonderful time.

00:10:42.234 --> 00:10:47.099
Talk to friends on the telephone, visit if I had somewhere I wanted to go, needed to do.

00:10:47.840 --> 00:10:53.586
I had several neat babysitters I could hire for 50 cents an hour.

00:10:55.203 --> 00:11:01.569
Were there some people that you now can look back and realize were very thoughtful those first two or three years?

00:11:01.589 --> 00:11:02.630
Oh, surely.

00:11:03.731 --> 00:11:04.052
Surely.

00:11:04.072 --> 00:11:06.894
One was Arla Gammon, who lived down the street from me.

00:11:07.855 --> 00:11:16.944
And when she had found out that I was Presbyterian, she got up a coffee of Presbyterian women in the group.

00:11:17.785 --> 00:11:21.749
And we used to play bridge together and chat and all this sort of thing.

00:11:24.291 --> 00:11:25.092
There were

00:11:27.063 --> 00:11:31.808
There were others that I met through, primarily through church.

00:11:33.009 --> 00:11:34.931
Some I met through political activities.

00:11:35.051 --> 00:11:38.315
I got involved in that fairly soon.

00:11:39.496 --> 00:11:41.998
And it was a nice life.

00:11:43.059 --> 00:11:44.461
When did you start taking classes?

00:11:45.302 --> 00:11:49.886
I signed up for my first class in September of 1965.

00:11:49.906 --> 00:11:51.348
65.

00:11:51.588 --> 00:11:56.293
Women had been officially admitted

00:11:56.746 --> 00:11:56.967
62.

00:11:56.987 --> 00:11:57.548
62.

00:11:58.530 --> 00:12:06.029
But still there, was there still the requirement for undergraduates that you had to have an A&M?

00:12:07.031 --> 00:12:09.878
For graduates and undergraduates.

00:12:09.993 --> 00:12:16.004
You had to have a husband or father who was on the faculty, staff, or student.

00:12:17.387 --> 00:12:23.658
And I signed up for my very first graduate class in English.

00:12:25.922 --> 00:12:29.789
It was a poetry course taught by Mr. Carol Laverty.

00:12:31.072 --> 00:12:34.077
And I thoroughly enjoyed it.

00:12:34.428 --> 00:12:40.498
as you went down the hallway about how many women did you see?

00:12:40.798 --> 00:12:41.459
Very, very few.

00:12:42.160 --> 00:12:42.801
Very, very few.

00:12:43.703 --> 00:12:46.828
There was a ladies' room in the academic building where the class was taught.

00:12:47.268 --> 00:12:50.714
I had been told that would be a problem in some buildings.

00:12:52.196 --> 00:12:52.597
The...

00:12:53.298 --> 00:12:55.562
I will never forget going to class my first day.

00:12:56.824 --> 00:13:00.790
At this point, I was 25, almost 25.

00:13:00.950 --> 00:13:02.072
I was still 24.

00:13:03.115 --> 00:13:06.959
First day of class, I felt like I was an undergraduate again.

00:13:06.999 --> 00:13:16.908
I mean, I was taken off the class and feeling really good about it, excited about it, and feeling very young again.

00:13:16.948 --> 00:13:27.638
And I was stopped in the hall by a freshman in the corps on my way to class who said, ma'am, can you tell me where English 103 section is?

00:13:29.460 --> 00:13:31.502
Which immediately made me feel ancient.

00:13:33.288 --> 00:13:35.513
call me ma'am.

00:13:35.813 --> 00:13:43.950
During those first two or three years that you took any courses, how do you now think women were treated in general?

00:13:46.194 --> 00:13:47.938
Female students I'm talking about, not

00:13:48.087 --> 00:13:50.212
I'm not sure I'm a good person to ask there.

00:13:50.412 --> 00:13:54.100
I was taking graduate classes in the English department.

00:13:55.343 --> 00:14:00.534
There were several graduate students, females, in the English department, most of them faculty wives.

00:14:01.576 --> 00:14:02.638
We were treated quite well.

00:14:03.440 --> 00:14:06.687
First place, the English department is

00:14:06.953 --> 00:14:09.840
gentlemen are on the faculty there.

00:14:10.661 --> 00:14:13.728
They were not about, and besides that, they were glad to have the graduate students.

00:14:14.350 --> 00:14:17.437
I now know, very glad to have them.

00:14:17.457 --> 00:14:20.023
It was no problem whatsoever.

00:14:20.905 --> 00:14:24.152
The only concern, and at the time I thought it was funny,

00:14:25.938 --> 00:14:55.067
was that when you registered you had to sign the piece of paper that essentially said and this is almost a direct quote that if the admission policy was changed so as not to admit women at all that you would voluntarily withdraw that you would not file a lawsuit against the university and i signed it because that was the only way that i figured dean heaton was going to let you get registered all right so you were not at all the victim of any uh inappropriate

00:14:55.199 --> 00:14:58.304
I might have been if I'd been 18, but not at 25.

00:14:59.005 --> 00:15:03.012
So who babysat while you were in classes?

00:15:03.553 --> 00:15:04.735
Oh, I had a deal worked out.

00:15:04.775 --> 00:15:06.357
I had several babysitters.

00:15:07.199 --> 00:15:15.132
Primarily one very, very nice lady named Mrs. Webb, who helped raise my small children at the time.

00:15:16.394 --> 00:15:41.608
and uh and you you're taking these courses you're you're doing you're a part-time student for a number of years and you get your degree in what okay i later changed i stopped taking courses with when there were three very small boys and started again in after i started working out here

00:15:41.588 --> 00:15:44.532
started taking one and sometimes two courses a semester.

00:15:45.273 --> 00:15:48.057
Got my master's degree in educational administration.

00:15:49.298 --> 00:16:07.883
I started working on a doctoral degree in business administration, took all of the courses for an MBA, did all the coursework for the PhD, and then chickened out when it came to the comprehensive two-day written examinations over coursework that I'd taken over a seven-year period.

00:16:07.863 --> 00:16:12.029
They told me I could go ahead and pay the fee and get the MBA, and I said, why?

00:16:14.452 --> 00:16:15.333
No interest.

00:16:15.353 --> 00:16:22.063
So you joined the workforce out here before you...

00:16:22.083 --> 00:16:23.364
Started seriously on the degree.

00:16:23.525 --> 00:16:24.406
And when was that?

00:16:25.167 --> 00:16:26.929
I started working out here in 73.

00:16:26.949 --> 00:16:28.351
And that was where?

00:16:28.952 --> 00:16:30.194
Admissions and Records.

00:16:31.395 --> 00:16:33.759
My title then was Information Representative One.

00:16:34.379 --> 00:16:36.983
And that was, who was the head person?

00:16:37.083 --> 00:16:37.684
Edwin H. Cooper.

00:16:38.035 --> 00:16:42.459
Describe what it was like to work in that group.

00:16:42.959 --> 00:16:48.804
Well, I was absolutely convinced that the entire campus revolved around admissions and records.

00:16:50.566 --> 00:17:06.760
In addition to Cooper, who had an unusual background for admissions and records, with a degree in wildlife science and then having been assistant to both President Rutter and to President Williams, Ed had a

00:17:08.461 --> 00:17:33.203
had more contacts than you were normally going to see in a situation like that the president still called on him for a number of special things i i felt fortunate in that he was nice to work for he was the kind of fellow who would give you an assignment and essentially let you know come back and see me if you have problems but you're on your own and i enjoyed that

00:17:34.972 --> 00:17:36.314
What were your primary duties?

00:17:36.474 --> 00:17:58.504
My primary duties at that point were to edit the university catalog, two of them, get them out every year, to serve as secretary to the curriculum committee, university curriculum committee, and recording secretary for the academic council, and other duties as assigned.

00:17:58.725 --> 00:18:00.507
And those were generally the ones I liked best.

00:18:01.297 --> 00:18:04.361
What was it like to edit the catalog?

00:18:04.461 --> 00:18:06.724
I've never chatted with a catalog editor.

00:18:07.785 --> 00:18:09.107
Well, I had never edited one.

00:18:09.147 --> 00:18:19.841
And my predecessor and I, we had a little overlap, so I learned the basics of it, pretty much what was involved.

00:18:21.303 --> 00:18:24.267
It was a logistical challenge.

00:18:25.546 --> 00:18:29.976
because each and every bit of it had to go out to the departments and so forth.

00:18:30.757 --> 00:18:39.015
You quickly learned that some departments were better run than others as far as getting their

00:18:40.480 --> 00:18:41.681
stuff done.

00:18:41.702 --> 00:18:53.816
Since this is in the past and a lot of water has passed under the bridge, which were the departments that got their stuff in quickest best and which ones were the least reliable?

00:18:54.217 --> 00:19:02.387
At that time, the ones that you could depend on absolutely the most were animal science, civil engineering, and mathematics.

00:19:03.818 --> 00:19:06.742
and mathematics was never a problem.

00:19:07.984 --> 00:19:13.111
Animal science was a problem only because of a editing thing.

00:19:13.932 --> 00:19:27.151
The ones that were most difficult to deal with were English and everything at Galveston and industrial engineering.

00:19:29.114 --> 00:19:32.138
They got it in slow and

00:19:32.371 --> 00:19:34.674
Oh, the industrial engineers my first year.

00:19:35.795 --> 00:19:43.283
They sent all of their material for the catalog, including a degree program called cybernetic engineering.

00:19:45.065 --> 00:19:58.260
And at that time, and it's not much different than it is now, any new degree program had to be approved by the college, by the university curriculum committee, by the academic council, by the board of regents, and then by the coordinating board.

00:19:59.354 --> 00:20:08.574
Well, I kept the minutes for two of those groups and was copied in on letters to the coordinating board frequently just so I would know the progress of it.

00:20:09.416 --> 00:20:12.683
I spent two days looking for any record of cybernetic engineering.

00:20:12.804 --> 00:20:13.465
Couldn't find it.

00:20:14.390 --> 00:20:21.216
I called the faculty member over there who had sent the material, and I said, I'm sorry, I cannot find this.

00:20:21.256 --> 00:20:23.679
You're going to have to give me some clues to the dates.

00:20:23.939 --> 00:20:25.140
I must have overlooked it.

00:20:25.741 --> 00:20:26.722
He just died laughing.

00:20:27.542 --> 00:20:32.767
And he said, Marilyn, he said, we haven't met yet, and I'll get over to meet you sometime.

00:20:33.188 --> 00:20:43.317
He said, I told him that probably wouldn't work, but they told me you were new, and maybe they could get it through, and you would print it, and then we could start teaching it, if it was in the catalog.

00:20:43.297 --> 00:20:49.999
And our mom had an obscenity and hung up the phone.

00:20:50.283 --> 00:20:51.645
All right, now that's a good anecdote.

00:20:51.685 --> 00:20:55.310
Can you remember any other anecdotes, positive or negative, about?

00:20:55.370 --> 00:21:02.200
The English department used to edit their catalog throughout the year, their portion of the catalog, throughout the year.

00:21:03.021 --> 00:21:15.779
And they would dispatch at random times during the year at least an associate professor, frequently a full professor, to come change a word in a course description.

00:21:17.542 --> 00:21:19.885
And I quickly learned that the

00:21:21.046 --> 00:21:31.225
had been that i it was pointless to suggest an alternative it was much easier on him and me both to just do it because they had already had a

00:21:32.453 --> 00:21:59.203
long faculty meeting to come up with that single word change and that this fella might even if he agreed with me he wasn't going to subject himself to that faculty meeting again and you know so i didn't do it david for a while was on the was the journalism department's representative on the uh liberal arts curriculum committee and there was some wrangle and

00:21:59.183 --> 00:22:17.766
at one of their meetings one time and some big discussion over what they could put in the catalog and what they couldn't and gentleman by the name of dr milton nance was presiding at the meeting and uh he kept saying talking about well i don't think the catalog editor will do this

00:22:18.286 --> 00:22:27.717
And Bill Barzac from the English department was sitting by David at the other end of the table and kept elbowing David and said, tell him you sleep with her.

00:22:27.737 --> 00:22:30.961
You'll get something done.

00:22:30.981 --> 00:22:32.843
But Nance never put the two of us together.

00:22:33.404 --> 00:22:35.266
We knew each other.

00:22:37.449 --> 00:22:38.890
Was the catalog printed on campus?

00:22:39.751 --> 00:22:39.952
No.

00:22:40.132 --> 00:22:42.535
They had started printing it off campus the year before I came.

00:22:43.656 --> 00:22:46.960
And it was printed at that time in Fort Worth.

00:22:47.260 --> 00:22:52.830
And it was still a comparatively traditional catalog in style and manner, wasn't it?

00:22:53.010 --> 00:22:54.373
They had jazzed it up.

00:22:54.513 --> 00:22:57.899
I wasn't in for the redesign, but it had been jazzed up the year before.

00:22:57.979 --> 00:22:59.782
At least the type was made a little bit larger.

00:22:59.822 --> 00:23:04.290
The history of the university was shortened somewhat.

00:23:05.080 --> 00:23:11.370
It had some color on the cover, some design, rather than just maroon and white.

00:23:11.971 --> 00:23:17.380
It was printed mercifully offset instead of hot type.

00:23:18.902 --> 00:23:22.448
And so that had been done the year before.

00:23:23.018 --> 00:23:42.951
now you didn't uh you you didn't have pr responsibilities for well no to some extent uh we did i was responsible for all the publications done by missions and records while we didn't do quote a view book we did other publications and this sort of thing and the way

00:23:44.973 --> 00:23:52.904
Whether I was doing any PR work or not, we all thought we were for the way Cooper operated and the things that came in through our office.

00:23:53.405 --> 00:23:55.428
And PR described very broadly.

00:23:56.149 --> 00:23:58.532
But we got involved in some fun things.

00:24:01.376 --> 00:24:14.895
The centennial convocation, the inauguration of Dr. Miller, and some other smaller projects, dedication of Rutter.

00:24:14.875 --> 00:24:16.417
Auditorium and Rudder Tower.

00:24:16.997 --> 00:24:20.041
Summarize those as you remember them.

00:24:20.061 --> 00:24:20.562
Which parts?

00:24:21.262 --> 00:24:24.546
Well, all three, the centennial and the inauguration.

00:24:25.007 --> 00:24:31.134
The centennial was a tremendous amount of fun, at least for me.

00:24:32.455 --> 00:24:38.082
The part that I worked on, I feel sure others are going to talk about what went on through the entire year.

00:24:38.855 --> 00:24:45.082
But the parts that I worked on were the concluding birthday celebration.

00:24:47.325 --> 00:24:58.157
When we were 100 years old and we planned a convocation in G. Raleigh White Coliseum that included a speaker who was carefully selected.

00:24:58.177 --> 00:25:06.246
It included representatives from learned societies and other universities in caps and gowns and an academic procession.

00:25:07.002 --> 00:25:09.966
We pretty much filled the old Coliseum for that.

00:25:11.769 --> 00:25:15.874
It involved a luncheon for 1,100 people.

00:25:17.296 --> 00:25:21.262
It involved a concert the night before.

00:25:21.322 --> 00:25:25.288
There was a lot going on during about a two-day span.

00:25:25.348 --> 00:25:27.070
We appointed

00:25:28.349 --> 00:25:41.042
host for all of our out-of-town dignitaries who came, tried to match people up with some interest they had in common, whether they'd gone to the same school or whether they were in the same field or whatever.

00:25:42.423 --> 00:25:45.390
And it was a big deal.

00:25:46.131 --> 00:25:56.354
The next year, precisely one year later, with two months notice, we did essentially the same thing again to inaugurate Dr. Miller.

00:25:56.995 --> 00:25:59.942
The books say you can't do it in less than six months.

00:25:59.922 --> 00:26:05.471
We did it in two, but we had many of the same sources to go back to.

00:26:05.511 --> 00:26:09.096
And I learned a very important lesson then.

00:26:09.116 --> 00:26:15.046
I would have thought that the A&M Centennial would have been the biggest thing going for lots of people.

00:26:16.047 --> 00:26:24.681
I discovered that the inauguration of a president creates far more excitement, attracts far more people.

00:26:25.302 --> 00:26:26.623
who want to be involved in it.

00:26:27.624 --> 00:26:29.807
It's politics, and that's all there is to it.

00:26:30.087 --> 00:26:30.287
All right.

00:26:30.307 --> 00:26:41.739
If we were today making a decision and there was a new president, do you think it would be prudent today to have a big ceremony?

00:26:43.822 --> 00:26:50.889
It obviously costs some money, but do you think the plus and minus, do you think it would be a good thing?

00:26:50.909 --> 00:26:51.630
Yes.

00:26:52.927 --> 00:26:59.594
It's kind of hard to draw attention to academic endeavors.

00:27:00.115 --> 00:27:06.582
It's far easier to draw attention to problems and to football teams and to new discoveries.

00:27:06.923 --> 00:27:18.175
But our day-to-day reason for being here, educating kids, the basic research, our reason for being here.

00:27:18.610 --> 00:27:22.805
It's hard to draw attention to it, both within the general public and the media.

00:27:23.848 --> 00:27:25.735
And I remember

00:27:26.423 --> 00:27:30.668
telling Jarvis Miller during some of that planning when he said, oh, now let's don't do that.

00:27:31.009 --> 00:27:32.771
You know, we're spending too much money.

00:27:34.473 --> 00:27:38.578
Dr. Miller, we're buying publicity for A&M, good publicity.

00:27:39.259 --> 00:27:40.481
And it does do that.

00:27:40.741 --> 00:27:45.027
It gets everybody's attention of what's going on.

00:27:45.587 --> 00:27:51.655
And yes, you inaugurate a president, but you sure have a chance to talk about what's being done in the biology department or the

00:27:52.546 --> 00:27:57.963
geophysics department or whatever at the same time and to talk about good news.

00:27:58.244 --> 00:28:05.627
And as I remember those years I don't remember any criticism of either of those big events.

00:28:06.350 --> 00:28:09.575
Let's back up and talk about Jack Williams a bit.

00:28:09.615 --> 00:28:14.402
Did you have any interaction with Dr. Williams and his staff?

00:28:14.543 --> 00:28:15.063
Yes, I did.

00:28:15.765 --> 00:28:21.333
And primarily, again, because I worked for Ed and because of the Academic Council.

00:28:22.515 --> 00:28:24.658
Most of my interaction was as an observer.

00:28:26.281 --> 00:28:31.108
The longest conversation I ever had with Dr. Williams was after he was no longer president.

00:28:32.030 --> 00:28:34.213
But the...

00:28:36.202 --> 00:28:40.111
I was pretty much in awe of him.

00:28:40.632 --> 00:28:51.797
I drafted a fair number of letters that he would send down to Admissions and Records, primarily things that had to do with admissions or

00:28:52.486 --> 00:28:56.112
had to do with financial aid because that was part of admissions and records at the time.

00:28:57.234 --> 00:29:00.299
And he would always send a copy back.

00:29:00.519 --> 00:29:10.796
I can remember because he was such a beautiful writer himself how proud I would be if nothing was changed or if it was only a single word or two that was changed.

00:29:12.178 --> 00:29:18.088
I was able to observe him in academic council meetings

00:29:19.064 --> 00:29:23.910
I quickly learned that getting him to schedule one was like pulling teeth.

00:29:25.092 --> 00:29:30.879
He hated to schedule them, and yet once he got there, he didn't want to leave.

00:29:31.700 --> 00:29:35.786
He was back, it seemed to me at the time, that he was back with his kind of people and he enjoyed it.

00:29:37.268 --> 00:29:41.393
I thought he made a mistake at the time, and I

00:29:43.550 --> 00:29:48.116
when he would sometimes make fun in a group that size.

00:29:48.136 --> 00:29:50.879
And that academic council was about 150 people.

00:29:52.441 --> 00:29:53.723
You'd hear him make fun of regents.

00:29:53.763 --> 00:29:55.806
You'd hear him make fun of legislators.

00:29:56.847 --> 00:30:03.776
I thought at the time that was probably a mistake, that unless he knew those 150 people a lot better than I did.

00:30:04.877 --> 00:30:08.562
But he was so quick on his feet.

00:30:09.807 --> 00:30:16.933
Some years ago, A&M stopped or started giving finals to graduating seniors, but at that time we didn't.

00:30:18.815 --> 00:30:28.804
And I never will forget Dr. Herman Hartley questioning that at an academic council meeting, bringing it up that it wasn't right.

00:30:29.985 --> 00:30:39.493
And Dr. Williams shut him up in a few well-chosen words, something to the effect that, Dr. Hartley, when I first came to this institution,

00:30:40.132 --> 00:30:49.594
five years ago or whatever, and learned of this practice not to make graduating seniors take final exams, I thought it was one of the more humane things we did.

00:30:49.634 --> 00:30:52.080
And that was the end of that discussion.

00:30:53.383 --> 00:30:55.768
When I first got here, I thought it was a bad idea, too.

00:30:55.969 --> 00:30:58.174
I later decided I liked it very much.

00:30:58.745 --> 00:31:10.665
Because somebody asked me how many people change their grade point ratio with one set of finals.

00:31:11.927 --> 00:31:20.702
And by having those people graduate the week before finals, it meant that all undergraduates were on the campus.

00:31:21.323 --> 00:31:25.868
and freshmen, sophomores, and juniors could go to commencement and be a part of it.

00:31:26.348 --> 00:31:27.750
Whereas today, they're gone.

00:31:27.770 --> 00:31:28.270
They're gone.

00:31:29.171 --> 00:31:43.606
And I'm assuming that for the registrar's office, it was good to have those seniors gone and out of the way and to concentrate on other things.

00:31:43.906 --> 00:31:44.546
On the final.

00:31:45.487 --> 00:31:50.993
But for those of us that had never done it that way, our tendency was to think that
