WEBVTT

00:08.485 --> 00:18.414
Okay, maybe a bit on the second question you ask 
about what's one of the new offshore claims doing

00:08.485 --> 00:18.414
to research. Well, first of all, it's especially 
delicate in the United States because we find oil

00:19.955 --> 00:37.530
on some of our own coastlines, and the U.S. 
Geological Survey is now starting to work heavily

00:19.955 --> 00:37.530
on our own coastlines. And so you don't find as much 
opportunity to work there on our own coast as we did

00:38.371 --> 00:46.725
before. And the foreign coasts are more and more 
closed to us. So this is, in some sense, pushing us

00:50.512 --> 00:53.296
into deep water. But it needn't be all bleak. We can 
get some work done with the geological survey, and

00:58.225 --> 01:04.395
we can get some work done with other countries. I 
think it just means we have to have more

01:04.730 --> 01:08.735
cooperative programs, is what it turns out. And we 
have to cultivate our contacts very carefully,

01:09.776 --> 01:15.663
especially in other countries, if we want to work 
off their coast. And we sure include them in plans.

01:19.847 --> 01:23.071
But that's a natural evolution of things in many 
respects. For a while, the United States had a very

01:23.972 --> 01:27.817
strong and unique position in oceanography. And 
now these other countries are developing their

01:27.837 --> 01:32.762
own capabilities, and they would like to be 
included in plans. It's quite understandable. So

01:35.105 --> 01:38.550
I don't look upon it as quite such a bleak thing as 
some people do. I think people can do research

01:40.052 --> 01:42.275
together. It's almost a tradition in National 
Archive anyway to work with people in other

01:43.396 --> 01:49.164
countries. I don't see that being any catastrophe 
that's going to rush on us.

01:56.755 --> 02:01.922
So I don't really worry too much about that, I 
guess.

02:02.375 --> 02:05.900
We're continually traveling and continually 
meeting people and working with them. And we have

02:05.920 --> 02:11.688
very little political problems with our own 
scientific level. The people that we worry about

02:14.352 --> 02:25.268
most are some of the developing countries who 
don't understand what we're doing and are

02:14.352 --> 02:25.268
naturally very suspicious. And we feel that 
that's unfortunate, that they wouldn't be

02:26.570 --> 02:31.116
suspicious if they knew us. But that will be able to 
come in time, I suppose. Well, I'm sure they

02:36.493 --> 02:44.140
confuse oceanographic vessels with the regular 
sort of spy vessel that comes close to their shore.

02:45.282 --> 02:46.102
Well, they do that. But there's another concern 
that they have that is quite understandable, that

02:46.723 --> 03:00.536
even if you're not a spy vessel, if you're just a 
scientific vessel and not one of their own, some

02:46.723 --> 03:00.536
other country will have the scientific data. 
Mm-hmm. And whether those scientists are mean to

03:01.572 --> 03:15.813
or not, very likely that data will be spread out to 
people of their own country for commercial

03:01.572 --> 03:15.813
exploitation quicker than it would be for their 
own people. So these kinds of concerns, just the

03:16.735 --> 03:28.913
very fact that you're gathering the data and not 
that you're really trying to have any clearly

03:16.735 --> 03:28.913
subversive means, that in itself appears to be a 
threat to some of the countries in that. So it's a

03:29.585 --> 03:35.313
very delicate thing about how you work off the 
shores. We have had some problems in some

03:36.995 --> 03:48.370
countries, but we're not panicking yet.

03:49.071 --> 03:49.471
Excuse me. Your relationship with other 
scientists. Which countries seem to produce the

03:53.256 --> 03:57.702
best oceanographers?

03:59.437 --> 04:04.021
Oceanography now, you know, is many things to many 
people. And as far as marine geophysics goes,

04:05.403 --> 04:11.629
Britain has had a very good reputation. And the 
United States has done fairly well. Canada now is

04:18.736 --> 04:22.539
doing quite well, and Japan is coming along very 
well.

04:25.462 --> 04:28.465
Those countries are coming along probably faster 
than the Soviet Union. Some countries are just

04:29.660 --> 04:32.783
getting into it, but getting into it fast. 
Germany, West Germany, and France. For many

04:37.067 --> 04:40.290
years, France had almost no marine physics 
program. And over the last few years, they've

04:40.310 --> 04:43.753
tried very hard to improve that situation.

04:46.816 --> 04:52.861
But you know, regardless of how you interpret the 
word oceanography, some countries have no

04:46.816 --> 04:52.861
oceanographic capability at all.

04:55.724 --> 04:59.127
Many in South America are trying very hard to 
develop oceanographic sentence. But it's a very

04:59.984 --> 05:05.130
difficult thing when they've got severe internal 
problems. It seems quite a luxury to them to go off

05:06.872 --> 05:13.319
and be studying things under the water, unless 
it's biological. The biological side is a very

05:15.041 --> 05:19.926
practical benefit from the fisheries work. So 
they frequently can see that as a first effort in

05:20.347 --> 05:25.873
marine science. We've had contact, as I think many 
institutions in the United States have, with a lot

05:27.372 --> 05:37.384
of the Latin American and South American 
countries, and this is very important to them, as

05:27.372 --> 05:37.384
well as other places in the Middle East and here and 
there. Fisheries is a big thing. But we've had

05:41.549 --> 05:50.541
contact with almost every country of any size in 
the world, and it's kind of pleasant working with

05:41.549 --> 05:50.541
them. When did you make your first voyage? Oh, my. 
First voyage, that was... The first voyage of any

05:56.600 --> 06:07.379
consequence for scientific research was made in 
about 1960, I guess, on the Vima. It was Vima cruise

06:08.761 --> 06:16.735
number 17, I think it was, off of the west coast of 
South America. Because I had been in the Navy

06:18.554 --> 06:22.619
before that, so I had... Yeah, been to sea before. 
It's a little frightening to think back when you

06:22.799 --> 06:29.888
first went to sea and realize it's been over 30 
years since you've been to sea. But I think there

06:29.908 --> 06:40.282
have been something like a dozen and a half cruises 
I've been on, more or less, one kind or another. And

06:40.462 --> 06:44.427
almost every part of the world, except the... high 
northern southern latitudes. I've had research

06:46.224 --> 06:49.067
programs there, but I haven't been on cruises 
there. I've had research programs in the Arctic on

06:50.769 --> 06:53.911
the ice islands. I've had Antarctic on the ice of 
Antarctica. I've been to every part of the world,

06:58.836 --> 07:03.220
so it's been quite interesting. Do you think 
oceanographers should go to sea? Yes, I do. I feel

07:08.925 --> 07:12.068
rather strongly about that.

07:13.263 --> 07:27.422
Maybe if you're a physical oceanographer and a 
theoretical type person, where you are just doing

07:13.263 --> 07:27.422
mathematical calculations,

07:13.263 --> 07:27.422
then maybe it's not so important. But if you're 
dealing with data acquired at sea, I think it's

07:27.522 --> 07:36.294
really very important that you get to sea so that 
you understand how that data is acquired.

07:39.017 --> 07:42.662
Especially in marine geophysics and marine 
geology, I think you really add a great deal of

07:43.773 --> 07:46.838
perspective by going to sea. It's one of the few 
professions that you can get in and you do

07:48.420 --> 07:57.855
everything from manhandling gear and working 
with your muscles to working with your brain. And

07:58.636 --> 08:05.126
you have to do a whole range of things and that makes 
for kind of an interesting job, I think. Many

08:05.146 --> 08:06.748
people like that challenge. You have to battle 
yourself against the elements when you go to sea.

08:11.175 --> 08:12.497
And there's a lot of

08:16.122 --> 08:19.346
People have an interest in doing that now. I think 
there are many stories about young people who

08:19.366 --> 08:26.915
found themselves at sea. They didn't quite know 
what to do on land, but when they get to sea and have

08:26.935 --> 08:36.487
to face a real challenge, a physical challenge, 
then they find something very satisfying in that.

08:37.348 --> 08:41.133
So you find a very interesting bunch of people, I 
think, in oceanography. It only seemed that way to

08:41.233 --> 08:42.855
me. Well, there's been some complaint, as a matter 
of fact, that younger oceanographers don't go to

08:43.443 --> 08:47.448
sea often enough. That's right. Don't get their 
feet wet is the word, I think, that one of your older

08:48.629 --> 08:52.333
colleagues used. Yeah, that's right. I would 
agree with that. It's really rather important. As

08:57.980 --> 09:12.336
a matter of fact, for students who are planning to 
study oceanography, I think it's very important

08:57.980 --> 09:12.336
that they go to sea before they decide to take up 
oceanography as a profession, to see if they like

08:57.980 --> 09:12.336
the ocean, because... There's a general tendency 
either to like it very much or dislike it very much.

09:16.941 --> 09:19.003
And lots of people just hate the water. They just 
think it's a physically disturbing environment

09:19.023 --> 09:28.495
to be in, and it's a risky environment, and it's 
disturbing to family life, et cetera, et cetera.

09:29.176 --> 09:30.197
And you just shouldn't be there. Others look upon 
it as a real challenge, and it's meant for only a few

09:30.497 --> 09:34.522
people. They're proud to be one of those few. So we 
try to encourage students to go on a cruise

09:44.041 --> 09:45.263
We don't know what they're getting in for.

09:49.970 --> 09:53.214
But I'm sure that's going to change in the future. 
I'm sure we're going to have lots of

09:53.254 --> 09:59.303
oceanographers that don't go out and face the 
elements like these. Well, now, you anticipate

09:59.323 --> 10:01.026
the next question. With the advent of such things 
as modeling becoming more and more important in

10:01.366 --> 10:10.620
oceanography, it looks to me like a number of those 
people will drop. And consequently, many older

10:10.680 --> 10:13.744
oceanographers are chronologically older 
oceanographers. I mean, I don't mean so much in

10:16.935 --> 10:24.522
age, but those who came through the older 
institutions or opposed to... Well, basically

10:16.935 --> 10:24.522
what's happening is people are specializing, you 
see. And their little piece of the action doesn't

10:24.542 --> 10:29.426
necessarily mean that they go to sea. They can 
design an instrument, for example, and have

10:30.507 --> 10:33.550
somebody else test it in sea. Or even if they go to 
sea, they don't have to repair all the

10:35.011 --> 10:38.394
instruments. You have electronic specialists 
for this and for that and for that, and you have

10:38.414 --> 10:42.938
computer specialists now who go to sea. At this 
institution, they go to sea quite regularly. We

10:45.385 --> 10:55.375
have computers go to sea all the time, 
general-purpose computers that do

10:45.385 --> 10:55.375
general-purpose plotting and amalgamating

10:45.385 --> 10:55.375
data and massaging data and whatnot and whatnot. 
And it used to be that one individual had to do all

10:55.975 --> 11:04.904
those things, besides tell the captain of the ship 
which way to go and look out for the weather and

10:55.975 --> 11:04.904
dodge the hurricanes and so on and so on. You don't 
have to do that very much anymore. It's the other

11:06.645 --> 11:08.127
people who do that. Navigation is getting much 
easier. Some of the electronics is getting quite

11:12.770 --> 11:18.376
sophisticated, too, so it's just not possible for 
a person to know the whole range of things. Now, it

11:19.437 --> 11:24.082
requires some pretty good electronics engineers 
to handle some of the equipment we have. We have

11:25.323 --> 11:31.690
real-time, multi-channel seismic processing 
going on on ships at sea, for example. It requires

11:31.830 --> 11:37.316
fairly good knowledge of computer processing and 
other instruments. And we have them all recorded

11:38.137 --> 11:39.919
digitally now. It's all digital recording. on mag 
tape, and that's happened in the last ten years or

11:42.250 --> 11:50.601
so, or less even, I guess. Before it was all 
recording it by simple machine and pins and

11:50.621 --> 11:55.367
whatnot. It's all changed now.

12:00.934 --> 12:07.143
But I don't think the field of oceanography is 
going to collapse, nor will it grow very fast. I

12:07.183 --> 12:10.587
think it will probably have a slow and orderly 
growth. I think the interest in it has grown faster

12:11.613 --> 12:17.199
than the field itself could be expected to grow. 
And to that extent, I blame the educational

12:18.080 --> 12:29.593
institutions in not having a better feel for how 
many new people the business needs. This happens

12:31.135 --> 12:37.502
all across our society, but we ought to have, with 
this day and time, we should have a better

12:38.630 --> 12:40.632
understanding of how many people we should train. 
Okay, well, let me pose this question for you,

12:41.133 --> 12:43.336
then. It's almost as if, from an outsider, uh, 
point of view, it's almost as if the NSF, uh, well,

12:43.957 --> 13:06.004
that'd be too strong, but at least those people 
associated with O&R who move into various

12:43.957 --> 13:06.004
National Science Foundation projects, in, let's 
say, the mid-50s, it's almost as if they went out to

12:43.957 --> 13:06.004
establish, uh, departments and academic 
institutions scattered across the country, to

13:06.288 --> 13:10.673
name a few for you. Fleming goes to Washington, for 
example, to establish one. Burt goes down to

13:15.419 --> 13:18.863
Oregon State not too many years later. There's one 
established at Texas A&M for Gulf Coast

13:19.384 --> 13:24.150
oceanography. There's one established in Miami 
when Walton Smith goes down to Miami. And I'm sure I

13:31.803 --> 13:35.288
could list others if I could think about it, but 
those come to mind. Each one of those seem to be as if

13:35.448 --> 13:40.074
it's almost deliberate. Do you think that, 
through hindsight, that was a mistake on the part

13:41.716 --> 13:47.865
of grant-giving institutions? That was clearly a 
response to political pressure that that

13:50.248 --> 13:53.953
happened. And there's nothing wrong in that. I 
think if you...

14:03.578 --> 14:12.428
If you jeopardize national goals by spreading 
your meager resources out too thin, then it's

14:03.578 --> 14:12.428
unforgivable. But sure, I think all these places 
ought to have the opportunity to learn something

14:13.389 --> 14:19.777
about oceanography. But we have to be careful 
about, number one, the funds that are available,

14:21.098 --> 14:25.844
and number two, how many students we turn out. We 
can't just expect the Congress of the United

14:27.426 --> 14:32.792
States to appropriate funds at the whim of the 
American young people who choose to find it very

14:33.228 --> 14:42.479
interesting this year to go into, because of the 
film Jaws or something, they decide to go into

14:33.228 --> 14:42.479
oceanography. And it's not logical, I think, that 
the American taxpayer is supposed to support that

14:42.960 --> 14:57.257
kind of interest which may be passing, especially 
if these people, once they've graduated, expect

14:42.960 --> 14:57.257
to work in oceanography, and there are no jobs. So 
it's interesting. If it's done as an

15:00.650 --> 15:04.655
entertainment, that's one thing. But I don't 
know. I think there are a number of us that got into

15:05.056 --> 15:10.643
the business simply because we couldn't hardly 
have done anything else. I mean, we just were kind

15:10.663 --> 15:12.585
of addicted by it. If they cut our pay in half, that 
wouldn't make any difference about whether we

15:12.686 --> 15:16.831
were at work or not. We were still at work. But there 
are a few people, I think, who have a certain degree

15:19.254 --> 15:28.446
of dedication, and others that approach it as a 
curiosity or as an amusement. And I don't think you

15:29.303 --> 15:34.629
should expect American taxpayer to support all 
these people. So I think physics is the same way

15:34.649 --> 15:37.132
right now. There hasn't been a good understanding 
between the educational institutions that

15:38.474 --> 15:48.506
haven't really understood how many people they 
should produce. They've never put, of course, any

15:49.467 --> 15:54.653
limit on how many people in a profession want to get 
trained in one profession. But I really think that

15:54.673 --> 15:58.197
they do have some obligation point out to students 
that if you enter as a freshman this year and intend

15:58.970 --> 16:07.498
to go through this particular course, that you 
will very likely have an extremely hard time when

15:58.970 --> 16:07.498
you get out. And that would tend, I think, to shut 
the students down paths that would be more helpful

16:08.218 --> 16:15.505
to them and to society. And you don't see much of 
that anymore, I guess. And that happens. I know

16:19.869 --> 16:26.395
there's some schools, so I won't mention any 
names, that turn out just any number of people in

16:27.353 --> 16:33.839
oceanography, and many of them have no jobs that 
they can go to, or no job that they're really proud

16:27.353 --> 16:33.839
of. Well, I think that's a mistake. I think it's 
careless. That's like having children without

16:38.023 --> 16:41.086
thinking what you're doing. It's having 
graduates without thinking what you're doing.

16:43.929 --> 16:44.830
It's just as careless. So that happens a lot in the 
United States, I'm afraid. Not only in the United

16:49.494 --> 16:50.435
States. Right now it's happening in Britain, I 
think. Marine research opportunities are

16:54.286 --> 17:02.460
extremely limited in Britain right now, and funds 
are very short, but yet they're turning out a large

16:54.286 --> 17:02.460
number of students. Good students, much, but they 
have to leave Britain. They just can't work in

17:06.527 --> 17:09.211
Britain. We see a lot coming to this country. We see 
a lot coming to Canada. Well, countries this day

17:12.436 --> 17:20.530
and time ought to be able to control that situation 
better and still keep people happy in their

17:12.436 --> 17:20.530
professions. Because right now, we're keeping 
them unhappy, I think, in that profession, these

17:21.269 --> 17:24.031
young people. So anyway, that's it. OK. Now, I want 
to, if I may, drop backwards in the interview

17:28.956 --> 17:34.340
again, OK? Sure. I wanted to pursue those 
questions while they were available. At Lamont,

17:37.603 --> 17:41.366
OK, what do you do when you leave Lamont? What does 
who do? You do. What did I do? Where did you go? I was

17:46.851 --> 17:50.314
director of a laboratory called the Hudson 
Laboratories. at Columbia University. It was in

17:52.340 --> 17:54.924
Dobbs Fair, New York, across the river from 
Lamont. It makes kind of an interesting story, I

17:57.508 --> 17:58.890
think. I'm not sure, going to all the details here, 
but that was a laboratory that was established

17:58.930 --> 18:08.865
after the Second World War to do acoustics 
research for the Navy. The Navy had no academic

18:10.007 --> 18:15.255
laboratory like that, at least not on the East 
Coast at that time. And they wanted an academic

18:16.552 --> 18:21.178
laboratory, and so they established this through 
the physics department at Columbia. And through

18:23.441 --> 18:28.448
the years, they had become terribly caught up in 
classified research. They had become more and

18:28.508 --> 18:33.575
more of a classified laboratory. And they decided 
in 1967, I'm shortening this quite a bit, to make it

18:35.537 --> 18:44.449
a laboratory that was not doing so much classified 
research, so it could be integrated into the

18:45.256 --> 18:48.741
university. And they asked me if I'd come over and 
help them do that. There was new facilities and so

18:52.106 --> 18:55.851
forth. Well, this was just at the time of student 
unrest in Columbia. And Columbia was one of the

19:00.618 --> 19:04.183
first schools that really blew up in those days. 
And the students were not about to wait for any kind

19:05.445 --> 19:11.854
of orderly change. They went into the president's 
office and pulled out the classified documents

19:12.239 --> 19:18.206
and threw them out in the yard and so forth and so on. 
And frankly, the Navy got very upset at this and

19:19.288 --> 19:30.121
told the senior administration there that, in 
effect, that they couldn't tolerate a situation

19:19.288 --> 19:30.121
like this. Either they would have to get the 
laboratory under control quite quickly and

19:30.201 --> 19:41.875
integrate it into the university, or they 
couldn't continue the laboratory. The

19:42.243 --> 19:52.637
administration in those days at Columbia 
couldn't handle the situation for a number of

19:42.243 --> 19:52.637
reasons, mainly the student problems. The 
student pressure was much too great, and it was

19:52.657 --> 19:59.947
almost dangerous to raise your voice against a 
student in those days. But the Navy decided to

20:01.209 --> 20:11.102
close the lab, and they decided, after I'd been 
there a relatively few months, to close that lab.

20:11.909 --> 20:13.931
and not wait for a change.

20:17.294 --> 20:19.736
My point of view is that the Navy should have given 
us more time. And the Navy felt otherwise, and they

20:19.796 --> 20:22.759
closed it. And the lab was closed in 1969, spring of 
1969. They had large ships, and we were going at

20:28.264 --> 20:39.093
what I would consider an amazing speed of 
diversifying the lab and reducing the

20:28.264 --> 20:39.093
classification problem. But nevertheless, the 
Navy didn't see fit to continue that. Well,

20:43.435 --> 20:52.093
shortly after that, the president and other 
administrative officials resigned from

20:43.435 --> 20:52.093
Columbia University, but nevertheless, it's 
unfortunate, the lab got caught in the squeeze.

20:53.075 --> 20:59.128
The students, of course, had no idea of what damage 
they had done, that they put four hundred people

20:53.075 --> 20:59.128
out of work and so forth and so on, and tremendous 
personal ramifications throughout the whole

20:59.716 --> 21:03.961
lab, that disruption. But then sometimes 
students don't stop to think about those things.

21:07.626 --> 21:16.537
But anyway, it was one of those situations where 
the university administration, the student, and

21:07.626 --> 21:16.537
the Defense Department pressures all came to bear 
on that lab. So I stayed until the doors were

21:17.779 --> 21:21.243
closed, finally closed. And then I came to Woods 
Hole after that. And was your choice to come to

21:24.507 --> 21:28.292
Woods Hole primarily based on the closing of that 
lab? Yes. It was. Yes. I felt it would do me good to

21:31.808 --> 21:33.991
get away from Columbia at that time. Well, that 
really was what I was implying. It had nothing to do

21:36.134 --> 21:37.596
with... No, no. I was offered a very nice position 
back in Lamont, and I thought it was best that I not

21:37.616 --> 21:43.484
stay with them at that time. After all, well, for a 
number of reasons, I just felt it was probably best

21:45.066 --> 21:52.656
that I get away from that particular situation. 
Since then, it's all quieted down, of course.

21:56.252 --> 21:58.455
Yeah, there are no more students who are doing 
these kinds of things. Right. And Woods Hole is a

21:58.615 --> 22:00.137
lovely place to be. It's really quite nice. It's 
grown tremendously since I've been here. Right.

22:06.745 --> 22:16.176
Now, so when you decided to come here in 69,

22:06.745 --> 22:16.176
what sort of position did you come in as a senior 
researcher? Yes, I was chairman of the Department

22:16.776 --> 22:18.939
of Geology and Physics. And I continued that 
position until last year. when I resigned, just

22:25.137 --> 22:32.425
because I knew there were other good people who 
could do the job quite adequately. And it was good

22:32.485 --> 22:34.628
for some kind of a change. And we did. We were very 
fortunate we got John Ewing here. But I came as

22:37.972 --> 22:40.474
chairman of the Department of Geophysics. And I 
think I might have made a few improvements around

22:40.575 --> 22:44.479
here. Well, now you've also anticipated the next 
question. Did you have something in mind you

22:46.742 --> 22:49.925
wanted to do with the department when you came? 
Yes, I did. The effort at Woods Hole was

22:55.158 --> 22:59.864
fragmented. They had a number of very good people 
here, but they were all kind of going in different

23:00.205 --> 23:05.171
directions. And as a matter of fact, this had been 
known as a place, and still is in many ways, known as

23:06.112 --> 23:13.622
a place where you have a lot of independent 
research groups. And trying to get those people to

23:14.363 --> 23:23.275
aim all their forces in one direction was quite a 
challenge.

23:23.845 --> 23:40.924
without trying to destroy anyone's personal 
interest or distort their approach to science,

23:23.845 --> 23:40.924
you can find common threads that go through groups 
like this and

23:23.845 --> 23:40.924
make kind of more of a spirit de corps in the 
department. And I think that's happened. We've

23:43.427 --> 23:45.149
improved the result tremendously. I think it was 
fine-tuning, is what you would call it. We put the

23:48.373 --> 23:52.317
right groups next to the right groups. We've got 
different types of ships now than we had when I

23:52.786 --> 23:56.329
came. This whole campus where we sit now, 200 
acres, we didn't have that in those days. All of the

24:01.855 --> 24:04.357
building program here has come since that time. 
The educational program was just getting started

24:05.438 --> 24:08.080
then. Now we have quite a respectable educational 
program, plus other programs. So it's been a good

24:13.506 --> 24:16.308
period of development here. In the last seven 
years? Yeah. We had a budget, I don't know, it must

24:20.092 --> 24:22.354
have been about five or six million dollars a year, 
maybe eight when I came, and now we're at

24:24.224 --> 24:31.270
twenty-two million. So it's grown. It's a big 
institution now. And helping it grow has been kind

24:35.594 --> 24:38.597
of fun. And there have been some growing pains, but 
it happens in every organization.

24:47.785 --> 24:53.910
When you first go to see, many years ago, and Given 
the way vessels operate now, what do you think are

24:54.093 --> 25:01.361
the major technological changes on the vessels 
which make oceanographic vessels more

24:54.093 --> 25:01.361
efficient?

25:05.805 --> 25:10.450
Well, everybody has profited greatly by the 
navigational procedures. You know, they were

25:10.470 --> 25:14.294
really extremely crude thirty years ago. Getting 
a ship across the ocean was just unbelievably

25:14.715 --> 25:17.537
crude. You were never quite sure when you were 
going to make a landfall where you were. But today,

25:21.194 --> 25:26.181
you have such precise navigation equipment. You 
can go out and you can sail for three weeks outside

25:26.441 --> 25:36.635
of land, and yet you go out and find a bump that's not 
much bigger than an automobile on the seafloor,

25:26.441 --> 25:36.635
things of that kind. You can do that now. And you 
couldn't do that before. So one of the major things

25:40.280 --> 25:43.244
has been the use of satellites. Satellite 
navigation has just made a quantum jump in our

25:43.264 --> 25:47.069
navigational accuracy. But there have been other 
things. a whole new electronic technology, the

25:49.544 --> 25:55.351
micro-miniaturization of circuits.

25:58.515 --> 26:01.619
It's just been a great boom. And the knowledge is 
improved in all fields. We're working from an

26:05.023 --> 26:09.208
entirely different database than we did in those 
days. In those days, everything was new.

26:11.711 --> 26:12.612
Everything you did was new. Now it's not so. Almost 
everywhere, you could dive in your submersible

26:13.974 --> 26:19.180
out in the Midlantic Ridge and travel a mile or two, 
you'll find a track where somebody's dragged

26:19.379 --> 26:26.888
something across the sea floor, thrown a Coke 
bottle. So it's not the wild forest that it was when

26:27.169 --> 26:31.734
it used to be. Now we're understanding it. But 
that's familiarity. That's not technology,

26:36.821 --> 26:38.102
really. I think computer technology, the 
micrometeorization of electronics, and the

26:39.184 --> 26:47.614
satellite navigation, I can't overstate the 
importance of satellite navigation. That's just

26:50.914 --> 26:52.055
been superb. For a reasonable price, you can 
locate yourself within a couple hundred feet in

26:53.417 --> 27:03.727
the middle of the ocean, which is quite something. 
That's the essential thing. The ships haven't

27:04.648 --> 27:06.570
improved much. I must say that was something I 
would have expected that would have improved

27:07.151 --> 27:10.114
more. But they're still the same, basically the 
same old things, and you still move at a speed

27:17.733 --> 27:19.756
snail's pace across the ocean.

27:22.640 --> 27:30.030
We were predicting in those days that you'd have 
ships that would—fast boats that would shuttle

27:22.640 --> 27:30.030
scientists out to platforms back and forth. That 
hasn't happened. We still have the same old chug,

27:32.033 --> 27:37.120
chug, chug, chug, chug that gets us across the 
ocean. Hardly more reliable than they were in

27:37.160 --> 27:38.983
those days. Creature comforts are a little 
better, not much.

27:46.640 --> 27:51.686
As a matter of fact, I guess losing sails, taking 
sails off ship was a thing that many people regret.

27:53.829 --> 27:56.993
So pleasant.

27:57.013 --> 27:58.956
Communications, of course, has greatly 
improved, too. The fact that you can talk freely to

27:58.976 --> 28:10.791
your ships and your colleagues who are at sea in any 
part of the world just by picking up the telephone

27:58.976 --> 28:10.791
right here and calling a radio show and getting 
them on the phone. And you do it quite casually. You

28:13.244 --> 28:14.807
ask them, what's happening today? What about that 
experiment you were planning yesterday? How did

28:16.569 --> 28:18.593
it come off today? You can do that. What did you have 
for breakfast and so forth? That would be a change

28:23.020 --> 28:24.382
indeed. Yes, it is. Now, in terms of discoveries 
which were made during your career,

28:25.384 --> 28:34.939
oceanographic discoveries or others, what 
amazed you the most? What took you the most aback,

28:35.400 --> 28:38.685
you the least expected? Well, the simplicity of 
sea flow spreading is far and away the most

28:40.471 --> 28:47.721
mind-boggling thing. I think it's hard for a 
person who's not in the field to understand why you

28:47.821 --> 28:56.113
should get so shook up about that. I don't know 
whether you want to deviate to the personal side.

29:01.741 --> 29:02.201
Maybe you do. Maybe that's one of the advantages of 
a thing like this. But I can remember very clearly

29:07.218 --> 29:16.268
several instances that stood out in my mind that

29:07.218 --> 29:16.268
made quite an impression on me. And I've told these 
on one or two other occasions. I can't remember

29:19.993 --> 29:23.256
whether they were recent or not. But in the theory 
of seafloor spreading, two things were happening

29:23.296 --> 29:31.566
in those days when we were studying seafloor 
spreading. One is we were studying about the

29:31.646 --> 29:36.972
motions of the continents across the seafloor. 
And not in an idle capacity, but in a very precise,

29:38.842 --> 29:45.933
we could give the year and the position of where it 
was. And secondarily, we were learning something

29:48.036 --> 29:54.545
about the Earth's magnetic field, that it 
reversed, and when it reversed, and how it

29:48.036 --> 29:54.545
reversed. And these two rather abstract things, I 
never thought when I was small that I'd ever get

29:55.807 --> 30:02.357
shook up about some sort of a silly thing like that. 
But there was one night in particular when I had

30:09.267 --> 30:14.033
been working on the reconstructing the Earth's 
magnetic field history of how it reversed. And I

30:15.155 --> 30:27.191
knew, I was quite certain one night when I went to 
bed at 4 o'clock in the morning, having worked on

30:15.155 --> 30:27.191
several computers for a long time, because we had 
trial and error methods and we had to use a lot of

30:15.155 --> 30:27.191
computer time to run these things through. I knew 
that I was the only person in the world that knew

30:28.452 --> 30:37.384
what had happened to the Earth's magnetic field 
for a period of 10 million years. Now, I've always

30:38.967 --> 30:48.315
claimed that geologists who talk about a million 
years here, or 500 million years, or 10 million

30:38.967 --> 30:48.315
years, don't really stop and try to appreciate 
what quantity of time they're talking about. But

30:49.556 --> 30:59.445
we were dealing in very precise quantities, and we 
knew just exactly what was happening on the Earth

30:49.556 --> 30:59.445
at some point 7.256 million years ago. And 
whatever creatures lived on the Earth, we weren't

31:00.606 --> 31:04.209
biologists very much. We didn't know much of this 
time. We knew the general types of animals. But

31:08.954 --> 31:12.124
those creatures were living in it. We knew an awful 
lot about a small segment of their environment.

31:17.241 --> 31:20.230
And we were absolutely sure we were right.
