WEBVTT

00:03.288 --> 00:05.471
It was actually pretty routine.

00:06.332 --> 00:11.838
You know, I'd be in the office doing administration, whatever was required.

00:11.918 --> 00:15.943
I tried to meet with the Corps commander two or three times a week.

00:17.184 --> 00:23.131
And of course, like I said, I would go over to General Simpson's office normally once a day.

00:23.191 --> 00:25.714
Sometime I would just call him if I was real busy.

00:25.754 --> 00:26.715
I'd call him.

00:26.735 --> 00:30.139
But just stay in touch with him.

00:32.347 --> 00:52.476
And of course, what I used to do at night, found out that all I had to do was walk over into the quad after taps and the word would get around, you know, bull, like bull in the dorm or commandants on the quad or bulls on the quad or something like that.

00:52.496 --> 00:57.443
And I could go over and walk, maybe walk through one or two dormitories and just walk

00:57.828 --> 01:00.131
and then sneak out of the Corps area.

01:00.371 --> 01:04.878
Well, for the next two or three hours, nothing's gonna happen because they think I'm around there somewhere.

01:04.938 --> 01:06.580
So I used to use that little trick.

01:06.620 --> 01:22.482
And we were having, there was one major problem in the Corps for a time, and that was with people making bombs or someone making bombs and blowing them up, which I thought was a very serious thing.

01:22.522 --> 01:27.008
And it's a wonder someone didn't get hurt, but that's a long story also.

01:27.376 --> 01:34.144
But a normal day is, you know, I'd go to work in the morning and- About what time did you get to the campus?

01:34.164 --> 01:48.642
Well I used to get there around 7 or 7.30, and then I had someone that would come in my office and talk to me for about 30 to 45 minutes and, you know, one of the other colonels, and I decided, you know, I didn't really

01:49.364 --> 01:52.287
care to spend that much time so I quit coming in that early.

01:52.307 --> 01:59.054
I started coming in about 8 o'clock after that and I could get just as much done anyway because all I'd do if I came in early was listen to him.

01:59.715 --> 02:03.659
You know sometimes come out early and go to breakfast with the troops.

02:06.202 --> 02:18.595
But generally it was, you know, and we of course had staff meetings I had to go to once a week and then I would have a staff meeting with all the three colonels and the way it was set up the other two colonels

02:18.878 --> 02:24.266
Air Force and Navy were deputy commandants at that time.

02:24.566 --> 02:26.529
Now, were they active duty?

02:26.930 --> 02:29.033
They were active duty, yeah.

02:29.053 --> 02:30.615
And who were they when you got here?

02:30.675 --> 02:40.449
Well, Ken Durham was the Air Force and Jack Ivins was the Marine who was in charge of the Navy program.

02:41.070 --> 02:47.940
And the membership of the Corps by services was about, out of the 2200, was about what?

02:48.578 --> 03:04.543
It was about, I don't know, about 40% Army and probably 35% Air Force, and then the Navy was the remaining, whatever that would be.

03:05.284 --> 03:14.078
Was there either factually or mythically any difference in the quality of the students in the three branches?

03:14.579 --> 03:16.662
No, not really.

03:16.979 --> 03:19.281
And nobody even claimed there was?

03:19.482 --> 03:21.684
No, I don't think so.

03:21.704 --> 03:22.765
That was never an issue.

03:24.026 --> 03:30.773
And as you began, nobody told you that this group was more troublesome than that one?

03:31.274 --> 03:32.755
Well, we had statistics, you know.

03:32.795 --> 03:39.102
Don Johnson kept the statistics on units, and we could see how they were... But those statistics didn't vary by service?

03:40.563 --> 03:40.864
Army?

03:41.424 --> 03:42.766
No, I mean, we kept statistics.

03:42.786 --> 03:45.769
In the Commandant's Office, we kept statistics on the Corps of Cadets.

03:45.789 --> 03:45.889
Sure.

03:46.527 --> 03:53.795
And I tried to be completely impartial when it came to services as much as possible.

03:56.178 --> 04:04.947
I tried not to favor anybody, and they were all treated as cadet companies and not as an Air Force unit or a Navy unit or anything like that.

04:06.689 --> 04:14.037
And so, and then I, of course, I had to spend some time in the Army on OTC, but I probably spent 5% of my time

04:15.586 --> 04:20.471
in the ROTC program, although they paid, the Army paid 100% of my pay.

04:21.092 --> 04:31.562
And I paid, played 90, I mean I spent 90%, 95% with the Corps, and the university paid me zero.

04:32.283 --> 04:35.206
The only thing I got from the university, I think I got football tickets.

04:36.687 --> 04:39.330
But other than that, there was no perks.

04:40.051 --> 04:40.611
All right.

04:41.072 --> 04:44.175
In the fall, that first fall?

04:44.459 --> 04:49.264
What happened on the various days of the week that were special?

04:49.744 --> 04:53.168
Was there a special core review on a certain day?

04:53.248 --> 04:54.349
No, no core reviews.

04:54.409 --> 04:55.630
Not at the beginning of school.

04:55.670 --> 05:09.283
We, I did, might have been my second year or something, started having a fall core review because we would have march-ins and, you know, they'd be training, trying to learn how to march over there in the quad.

05:09.303 --> 05:12.947
And there was a lot that would go on in the quad in the afternoons.

05:13.383 --> 05:19.534
out marching and of course some playing intramural sports.

05:19.975 --> 05:22.539
Was intramural still pretty?

05:22.559 --> 05:22.719
Oh yeah.

05:22.739 --> 05:23.921
It was a big thing.

05:23.962 --> 05:25.905
Still is a big thing in the Corps.

05:26.225 --> 05:28.309
Which day was there more drilling?

05:29.972 --> 05:35.121
It was, we didn't have any drill like we did when I was a cadet.

05:35.270 --> 05:43.259
Now I did eventually institute that for the Army ROTC program, a two hours drill one afternoon a week.

05:44.900 --> 05:50.366
But it was not required by the, you know, the ROTC curriculum.

05:50.426 --> 05:53.790
It was just something I put in as an extra requirement.

05:53.810 --> 05:56.833
But any day of the week you'd go over there and there'd be units marching around.

05:57.254 --> 06:05.142
And especially before football games because they, you know, they were graded on their performance on the march in and they would,

06:06.083 --> 06:08.045
They were trying to, you know, do their best.

06:08.125 --> 06:17.977
Now, usually on Thursday afternoon, there would be a retreat formation, and the band would be out there, or they call it the drum bugle corps, which actually was about half the band.

06:18.818 --> 06:21.961
And we'd have a retreat formation and march in.

06:21.981 --> 06:32.293
Of course, the corps marches in, you know, three times a day during the school week.

06:32.662 --> 06:38.428
So that was one thing I'd usually a lot of times go over on that retreat formation.

06:38.448 --> 06:43.933
About how often did you eat in Duncan Dining Hall that first fall?

06:43.953 --> 06:46.716
Oh, probably three times a week.

06:47.256 --> 06:50.980
A lot of times I would go in there and just look around and wouldn't eat, you know, just go in.

06:51.280 --> 06:55.865
Now what was the, did the Corps have a special nickname for the Commandant?

06:57.246 --> 06:59.108
Well, they called me Uncle Woody.

06:59.341 --> 07:00.162
Uncle Woody.

07:00.362 --> 07:01.384
Uncle Woody, yeah.

07:01.404 --> 07:02.245
Okay.

07:02.265 --> 07:07.712
Because the bull being in the building, that meant any officer didn't it?

07:07.732 --> 07:07.832
Yeah.

07:08.232 --> 07:10.335
A bull was a military officer.

07:10.435 --> 07:14.280
And they didn't identify you as the head bull or the big bull or anything like that?

07:14.300 --> 07:15.201
Not that I know of.

07:15.341 --> 07:18.165
I'm sure I had a lot of other names.

07:19.547 --> 07:27.677
When, as you began, as you're beginning your duties as commandant, when did you have the first kind of heart touching

07:28.450 --> 07:34.881
event that caused you to be real proud to be in that role as an Aggie?

07:34.901 --> 07:39.609
Well, I think it was the first time they marched into Kyle Field, you know, seeing the Corps march in.

07:40.150 --> 07:41.151
For the first football game?

07:42.113 --> 07:43.235
Yeah.

07:43.255 --> 07:45.118
Do you remember anything about that march in?

07:45.238 --> 07:45.459
No.

07:45.719 --> 07:46.240
No, I don't.

07:46.439 --> 07:50.404
You weren't the official reviewing officer?

07:50.444 --> 07:58.575
No, I was on the reviewing stand, but we normally had a general officer who would be invited to come down and be the reviewing officer, but I'd be on the reviewing stand.

07:59.516 --> 08:04.263
And when did you, how long was it before you had to deal with a real serious problem?

08:05.004 --> 08:10.871
Well, it wasn't what you would consider a serious problem, but I considered it a problem.

08:12.453 --> 08:13.695
And the problem was that

08:14.418 --> 08:33.861
In the Corps at that time, if a freshman, if a senior asked a freshman what outfit he was in, then he would have to hit a hump and give his little outfit chant or outfit, I don't know what you would call it, but outfit yell, which took, you know, a little time.

08:34.533 --> 08:48.335
And I found out that these freshmen were trying to get out of the quad to go to the eight o'clock class and they were having stopped 10, 15, 20 times because these, of course, these seniors were just new seniors, you know, just got their boots and they were feeling their oats.

08:48.415 --> 08:52.482
And so every time they would see a freshman, they would ask him, you know, what outfit are you in?

08:52.542 --> 08:54.685
So these freshmen, he was taking them

08:55.424 --> 08:59.452
15, 20 minutes or longer to get out of the core area.

08:59.872 --> 09:02.257
And, you know, they were cutting it close to go to class anyway.

09:02.297 --> 09:05.583
So, as a result, a lot of them were being late to class.

09:06.345 --> 09:14.580
Well, as soon as I found that out, that was my first real dealings with the core staff on something serious.

09:15.442 --> 09:16.504
And I call the

09:16.906 --> 09:21.072
commander and the deputy commander and I'm not sure who else was in that.

09:21.452 --> 09:38.437
It might have been several other Corps staff members and I just put it to them bluntly that we had to do something and I thought if it came from the Corps leadership it would be a lot easier on everyone rather than me putting out an order that there would be no humping before noon.

09:39.498 --> 09:44.365
And so they went along with me on it and they put out the word that there would be no humping

09:44.986 --> 09:48.370
Before noon, well, you know, got a lot of flack about that.

09:48.450 --> 09:50.632
That was just, you know, Corps gone to hell.

09:50.992 --> 09:51.793
You know, old Army.

09:51.913 --> 09:56.899
I never even heard of that when I was a cadet, so I know it wasn't really old Army.

09:58.741 --> 10:13.677
In order to enforce that, I sent some bulls over, and I went over myself for a while, and any time I heard any freshman humping, I'd find out who gave him the request, and I gave him a weekend restriction.

10:14.045 --> 10:16.108
You know, that caused a lot of heartburn around.

10:16.168 --> 10:18.671
And I had a bunch of seniors on weekend restrictions.

10:20.173 --> 10:24.980
So it didn't take long we, you know, we eliminated that little practice.

10:25.000 --> 10:27.623
Now, they're probably doing it again today.

10:27.643 --> 10:28.204
I don't know.

10:28.244 --> 10:31.769
But the Corps staff did stick up with me.

10:31.789 --> 10:34.533
And, of course, they were testing me and I was testing them.

10:34.673 --> 10:38.879
So that was the first, I guess you'd consider the first crisis.

10:39.620 --> 10:42.043
Do you remember who the first Corps commander was?

10:42.063 --> 10:43.144
Yeah.

10:43.165 --> 10:43.545
Gentry.

10:44.572 --> 10:48.737
In fact, he's a lawyer here in College Station.

10:49.878 --> 10:52.841
And a super commander, super young man.

10:54.983 --> 10:58.567
Jarvis Miller became president and you knew Jarvis.

10:58.647 --> 11:03.052
Describe your first conversations with him after he became president.

11:03.072 --> 11:06.215
Well, after he became president, you know, I went to see him again.

11:06.275 --> 11:08.638
I'd seen him a few days before that.

11:09.496 --> 11:17.565
You know, we always talk over old times, and I went down to congratulate him, but of course he was plenty busy at that time, just coming on board.

11:18.666 --> 11:23.691
I was really thrilled that he was gonna be the president, because I knew I would have some backing.

11:24.192 --> 11:29.918
And see, the dormitories were in terrible shape, so I kind of blindsided Jarvis in this.

11:30.018 --> 11:36.085
I said, I invited him to come over and have dinner with the Corps one night.

11:36.105 --> 11:37.967
So he said, you know, he would come over,

11:38.437 --> 11:40.439
I said, let's take a walk through these darms.

11:40.759 --> 11:43.281
Let's look at our old darm.

11:43.301 --> 11:45.043
Well, the darms were in terrible shape.

11:45.063 --> 11:49.166
The paint was peeling off the walls, and they really looked bad.

11:50.287 --> 11:53.470
And he said, I didn't realize how bad these were.

11:53.490 --> 11:55.252
I said, well, Jarvis, this is just one.

11:55.392 --> 11:57.494
I said, you've got 11 more just like it.

11:57.534 --> 12:08.123
I said, it's a shame the way these things have been let, you know, have been let run down, and there really hadn't been too much maintenance on them.

12:09.200 --> 12:19.294
So, anyway, as a result of that, immediately housing found some funds to, because all the funds were going to the other side of the campus, civilian dorms.

12:19.394 --> 12:19.955
I knew that.

12:20.235 --> 12:25.823
They were getting the priority on everything because, you know, you got, you know, you've got those people over in the Corps.

12:25.883 --> 12:28.106
They're, you know, you've got a captive audience there.

12:28.587 --> 12:32.492
We really don't have to please them, but we really need to please these civilian students.

12:32.532 --> 12:36.878
So, anyway, some money was diverted, and I got the dorms painted, and,

12:37.195 --> 12:38.678
and some renovation done.

12:38.778 --> 12:43.267
Of course, they're still, even today, they're 1939 darms.

12:43.829 --> 12:48.178
One of these days, they're going to have to be replaced.

12:48.799 --> 12:50.462
So Jarvis was very supportive there.

12:50.522 --> 12:55.272
Another way Jarvis was supportive is that I invited him up to summer camp

12:55.825 --> 12:58.329
In fact, I never did go to summer camp.

12:58.389 --> 13:08.282
I was exempt each year because I had this program, this new student program back here at A&M, and so I always got excused from going to the Army ROTC summer camp.

13:08.363 --> 13:13.950
But I did go up there once each year and visit, and I would take a representative from A&M with me.

13:13.970 --> 13:18.256
Well, the first year I took Jarvis, and we went up there, and we were standing out.

13:18.377 --> 13:22.963
We were at the Officers Club, and they had some little function at the Officers Club, and we were standing out on the terrace, and

13:23.568 --> 13:27.794
And we were talking and he said something about Don Johnson.

13:28.575 --> 13:31.780
And I said, you know, it's a shame they don't pay that guy anymore and they pay him.

13:33.242 --> 13:36.186
I said, I'm just embarrassed about how low his pay is.

13:36.326 --> 13:37.848
And he said, well, what are you talking about?

13:37.928 --> 13:39.651
And I told him what Don Johnson was making.

13:39.691 --> 13:40.712
He said, that's terrible.

13:41.393 --> 13:43.516
He said, send me a memo when I get back.

13:44.518 --> 13:49.966
And so I sent him a memo requesting that he be, you know, his pay be increased and so forth.

13:49.986 --> 13:52.309
And it was...

13:52.492 --> 13:57.882
Shortly thereafter, he got a sizable increase in pay.

13:59.245 --> 14:02.391
Now, summer camp for Army in those days was?

14:02.411 --> 14:04.976
It was at Fort Riley, Kansas.

14:04.996 --> 14:06.058
Fort Riley, Kansas.

14:07.561 --> 14:09.184
Where the climate is always.

14:09.687 --> 14:10.688
It's always bad.

14:10.788 --> 14:12.230
It's hot or cold or something.

14:12.250 --> 14:13.010
Yep, yep.

14:13.030 --> 14:15.573
And windy, or nothing stirring.

14:17.475 --> 14:24.742
The, that first fall, did you, what was it like to be the Commandant on a Corps trip?

14:26.323 --> 14:39.036
Well, you know, it's funny the way these Corps trips work, and probably this is the only school that could do this, but you know, Friday afternoon you tell them, okay, fall in Saturday morning

14:39.472 --> 14:44.156
And you give them a location in Fort Worth, Dallas, Austin, or wherever they are.

14:44.176 --> 14:44.497
Houston.

14:44.597 --> 14:46.118
Houston, yeah.

14:46.138 --> 14:50.422
You tell them where to be and what time, and they would scatter, and everybody would get there.

14:50.883 --> 15:00.371
And, you know, most places they would have to organize a train or buses and ship them up and ship them back and feed them and house them and everything like that.

15:00.411 --> 15:02.133
But, you know, it always worked out.

15:02.153 --> 15:04.255
It worked out for us, and we didn't have any cars.

15:04.335 --> 15:06.357
We had to hitchhike to a court trip.

15:07.062 --> 15:23.061
But it worked out fine, and so about the only activity I had on the court trip was to be on the reviewing stand when they had the, you know, I'd go down where they were organizing the courts, but be on the reviewing stand when they had the parade downtown in Austin or Houston.

15:23.141 --> 15:28.287
Who was responsible for making the arrangements with the municipal authorities?

15:28.307 --> 15:29.889
Okay, that was Don Johnson's job.

15:30.129 --> 15:32.973
He made those arrangements for years.

15:33.093 --> 15:35.095
During your five years?

15:35.235 --> 15:35.596
Five years.

15:35.736 --> 15:36.597
Any problems?

15:36.982 --> 15:39.224
I don't remember any problem.

15:39.244 --> 15:40.005
From court trips?

15:40.025 --> 15:41.566
No.

15:41.886 --> 15:43.728
We had no tragedies, did we?

15:44.369 --> 15:45.910
Not on a court trip, no.

15:45.930 --> 15:48.613
In fact, they had very few tragedies.

15:48.753 --> 15:53.937
I know we had a sophomore kill one time down here on the road to Navasota.

15:53.957 --> 15:58.341
That's about the only one I remember, you know, losing.

15:59.002 --> 16:04.407
That first fall, do you remember going to your first Silver Taps as Commandant?

16:05.585 --> 16:09.090
Well, I don't, I know that I went, but I really don't remember it.

16:09.110 --> 16:10.392
But it was the same as it used to be.

16:10.412 --> 16:11.294
Nothing had changed.

16:11.334 --> 16:12.335
Nothing has changed.

16:12.816 --> 16:15.861
And what about football games?

16:15.961 --> 16:22.691
How were, you know, his commandant had, was a football game routine about what you remembered when you left?

16:22.811 --> 16:23.893
It was just about the same.

16:24.214 --> 16:33.027
You know, the Corps marched in, then they went to the stands, and if they won, they took the yellow leader to the fish pond, and if they lost, they,

16:33.428 --> 16:35.550
Now, Emory Ballard was the head coach when you came.

16:35.570 --> 16:36.051
Emory Ballard, yes.

16:36.071 --> 16:39.555
And we were winning some games then.

16:39.575 --> 16:41.417
Yeah.

16:41.517 --> 16:48.225
During, on a football day, home football Saturday, what, describe the routine for the Commandant.

16:48.245 --> 16:50.387
What, what time did you have to do what?

16:51.429 --> 16:59.638
Well, I'd usually come over to the core area in the morning and, but I'd have to get home and change clothes because I was invited to the President's luncheon.

17:00.293 --> 17:04.540
and change clothes and go to the president's luncheon and then go over with the reviewing officer.

17:04.600 --> 17:18.083
And if it was, we rotated between the three colonels and each one would be responsible for so many games to have the general down and he was the escort for the general and so forth.

17:18.063 --> 17:25.616
If it was not my, if it was not an army general, I was free and then I would just go to the luncheon and then go over and I sat in the president's box.

17:26.818 --> 17:29.342
Be on the reviewing stand of course and sit in the president's box.

17:29.362 --> 17:34.611
Now if I had a general then I would have a lot more responsibility to get him there and so forth.

17:34.811 --> 17:38.037
In a normal week were you in uniform pretty well all day?

17:38.357 --> 17:39.379
I was in uniform

17:39.781 --> 17:40.422
habitually.

17:40.442 --> 17:42.985
I never wore civilian clothes except off duty.

17:43.846 --> 17:44.547
That's what I thought.

17:45.148 --> 17:48.873
And then who made the arrangements for the reviewing officers?

17:49.374 --> 17:50.255
Well, the three colonels.

17:50.355 --> 17:51.556
We divided it up.

17:51.617 --> 17:56.022
General Simpson was kind of the moderator of this exercise.

17:56.783 --> 18:03.692
And we would know well in advance and we would get these generals lined up several months in advance to come down.

18:04.273 --> 18:07.257
Now, there were times when I was directed

18:07.912 --> 18:08.754
to bring someone in.

18:08.794 --> 18:19.593
I know Wisenbaker one time pulled me aside at a ball game and he said, I want Glenn Cothman, who used to be my roommate, incidentally, when I was a sophomore.

18:19.613 --> 18:20.214
Used to be yours?

18:20.274 --> 18:30.392
Yeah, he was my roommate when I was a sophomore, or we were roommates, and he was a major general in the Texas National Guard, and he was also a state senator.

18:30.452 --> 18:31.995
Well, we normally

18:32.296 --> 18:36.440
invited regular Army officers or regular officers from the military services.

18:36.500 --> 18:40.405
We did not invite reserve officers, National Guard officers, people like that.

18:41.005 --> 18:43.488
And he said, I want you to invite Glenn Koltzman down here.

18:43.568 --> 18:48.934
I said, yes, sir, I'll get with General Simpson and we'll work something out on it.

18:48.974 --> 18:50.856
He said, you didn't understand what I said.

18:50.876 --> 18:54.700
I want him invited and he's sitting right down there.

18:54.780 --> 18:58.324
You go down and invite him to be the reviewing officer.

18:59.445 --> 19:01.527
So, you know, I understood the mission.

19:02.232 --> 19:15.651
Talking about the reviewing officers, during your years here, who were some of the truly notable reviewing officers that you remember, either at a football game or at a final review?

19:16.792 --> 19:23.041
Well, I remember the Marine Corps Commandant was down here, and he was a Medal of Honor winner.

19:23.502 --> 19:29.370
I'm not sure, can't remember what his name was, but it might have been, anyway.

19:29.705 --> 19:37.634
Then I had Shai Meyer, who was Chief of Staff of the Army, who I'd worked for years before, General Edward Meyer.

19:37.714 --> 19:38.595
M-E-Y-E-R.

19:38.616 --> 19:40.017
M-E-Y-E-R.

19:42.340 --> 19:44.302
And they called him Shai, Shai Meyer.

19:44.322 --> 19:49.508
And he was Chief of Staff of the Army, but I'd worked for him when I was in Heidelberg, and desops over there.

19:52.912 --> 19:55.155
And we never had any incidents during...

19:55.456 --> 19:55.796
No.

19:56.277 --> 19:58.220
March-ins or final reviews?

19:59.662 --> 20:00.964
No incidents that I know of.

20:01.745 --> 20:02.767
Thank goodness.

20:03.067 --> 20:07.313
What were your, during a football game, what were the concerns of a commandant?

20:09.036 --> 20:20.873
Well, my concerns, especially the first and second year, at Thanksgiving, there was some, you know, a prank in the Corps where the

20:21.359 --> 20:31.709
freshman would steal the company commander's clothing, put it in a footlocker, and then run out on the field and drop the footlocker in the middle of the field and take off.

20:31.849 --> 20:33.550
Well, this was embarrassing.

20:33.610 --> 20:34.791
I thought it was very stupid.

20:35.492 --> 20:37.894
So I was going to put a stop to it.

20:37.914 --> 20:49.425
So I would sit up in the stands, and I would take my binoculars with me, and I would survey down at the end zone because that's where it always started, especially when you had those seats down there.

20:49.912 --> 21:03.176
and I'd see these freshmen come in sneaking in with a footlocker and I would get up and I would go down there and I would threaten them with an inch of their life if they dared take that footlocker on Kyle Field.

21:03.196 --> 21:05.119
So I finally got that

21:05.943 --> 21:07.766
that little thing stopping.

21:07.786 --> 21:15.177
I got Tom Parsons to help me with the KKs, the University Police, to kind of watch for those people and not let them bring them.

21:15.217 --> 21:17.881
First of all, don't let them bring the Foot Locker into the stadium.

21:17.901 --> 21:23.229
But I think they brought the Foot Locker in, you know, like a day or two and hid it somewhere in the stadium.

21:23.249 --> 21:25.993
But anyway, to prevent them from going out on the field.

21:25.973 --> 21:28.977
Now that had not happened when you were... I never heard of that.

21:29.177 --> 21:29.478
Really?

21:29.578 --> 21:31.280
No, never heard of that.

21:31.300 --> 21:31.500
Okay.

21:31.520 --> 21:36.667
We wouldn't dare steal our upperclassmen's clothes, especially a senior, you know.

21:36.988 --> 21:41.053
Did you pretty well get it cut down while you were Commandant?

21:41.153 --> 21:50.766
Well, I got some of it stopped and then they had what they call hauling off where they would take people off somewhere and supposedly took one guy to Oklahoma and

21:50.746 --> 21:52.308
I heard that story.

21:52.328 --> 21:58.157
And took people here and there, and we kind of got that under control.

21:58.177 --> 22:01.141
It was hard to stop anything.

22:01.602 --> 22:04.046
What you had to do was get it under control.

22:04.226 --> 22:12.078
And it's like one of the most serious things in the Corps when I was there was people making these pipe bombs and blowing them up.

22:12.578 --> 22:14.341
It's a wonder someone wasn't hurt.

22:14.902 --> 22:20.550
But I finally got a lead on that, and it turned out to be Boom Boom Olson.

22:21.273 --> 22:23.016
And they called him Boom Boom.

22:23.036 --> 22:23.797
Was he a student?

22:23.937 --> 22:26.021
He was a student in the Corps.

22:26.041 --> 22:30.067
And finally I pinned him down and I got him kicked out of the Corps.

22:30.087 --> 22:33.212
What was the source of the explosive?

22:34.694 --> 22:35.335
Black powder.

22:35.576 --> 22:37.459
You can buy it in any gun shop.

22:37.479 --> 22:41.345
Black powder and put it in a pipe and put a little pipe and put a fuse on it.

22:41.806 --> 22:45.171
And as far as you know, where were they actually making them?

22:45.387 --> 22:46.249
In the dorm.

22:46.329 --> 22:46.790
In the dorm.

22:46.830 --> 22:47.391
Sure.

22:48.233 --> 22:50.338
And what were they then doing with them?

22:50.358 --> 22:54.708
Well they were planting them out in the middle of the quad and making a loud explosion.

22:55.229 --> 22:56.612
I know one of them they put on a

22:56.980 --> 23:02.048
on the window of one of the latrines, and fortunately there was no one in there had they been in there.

23:02.108 --> 23:04.531
The glass, you know, shattered all in the latrine.

23:05.613 --> 23:07.296
So it was dangerous.

23:07.316 --> 23:10.340
So I spent some effort on stopping that.

23:10.400 --> 23:15.107
As far as you know, was anyone ever injured seriously?

23:15.188 --> 23:16.409
I don't know of anyone that was.

23:17.591 --> 23:22.819
All right, now, for years they had been making

23:25.415 --> 23:27.440
can of Babo.

23:27.480 --> 23:30.186
They'd been making Babo bombs for years, hadn't they?

23:30.206 --> 23:31.429
Well, yeah, I guess so.

23:32.772 --> 23:34.396
Some of these might have been Babo bombs.

23:34.416 --> 23:36.200
You know, they made a loud noise.

23:36.481 --> 23:38.847
And using, what is it, M60 or M80?

23:39.308 --> 23:40.410
M80 firecrackers.

23:40.551 --> 23:41.533
Firecrackers.

23:41.513 --> 23:44.057
I've heard stories about those.

23:47.422 --> 23:49.285
You said the bombs.

23:49.405 --> 23:51.488
This was the bomb you were talking about.

23:52.370 --> 24:00.983
And as far as you know, one was never set off in a room, a pipe bomb, never set off in a car or anything like that.

24:01.143 --> 24:01.464
No.

24:01.484 --> 24:05.310
Somebody blew up the bugle stand one time with one of them.

24:05.550 --> 24:06.171
Really?

24:06.961 --> 24:12.312
And that was bad because, see, General Simpson's class, 1936, had given that bugle stand.

24:12.333 --> 24:16.241
So we had to get it, you know, repaired and placed back.

24:16.862 --> 24:18.245
What time, day or night, was this?

24:19.147 --> 24:20.711
These things always happen at night.

24:20.971 --> 24:21.873
Middle of the night?

24:22.254 --> 24:22.354
Yeah.

24:22.975 --> 24:34.127
The, during those first months that you were in charge, did you get any phone calls in the middle of the night at home?

24:34.347 --> 24:35.208
Oh yes, yes.

24:35.488 --> 24:37.831
What kind of, what was the nature of those?

24:38.932 --> 24:48.983
See I told my wife, she would be very upset because we had, you know, daughters and any time you get a phone call midnight or later you know it's bad news and you know she'd be all

24:49.334 --> 24:52.958
excited, you know, very concerned when the phone rang late at night.

24:53.899 --> 25:04.451
And I told her what happened was that the mother said, I'm going to call the commandant because her son had called her and was complaining, crying or something.

25:05.132 --> 25:06.594
Got the mother all upset.

25:06.694 --> 25:10.258
So the mother's upset and she keeps saying, I'm going to call the commandant.

25:11.039 --> 25:14.202
And the father is saying, no, it'll be all right.

25:14.223 --> 25:16.405
Let's just, we can do it tomorrow.

25:16.823 --> 25:20.670
And so finally, the father gets to the point where he would like to go to bed and go to sleep.

25:20.730 --> 25:24.616
So in order to put a stop to it, he says, call her.

25:24.977 --> 25:25.678
I mean, call him.

25:25.798 --> 25:30.687
And so by this time, it's, you know, 10, 11, 12 o'clock at night, and I get a call.

25:31.949 --> 25:36.797
Very few of them really were substantial, you know, in nature.

25:36.817 --> 25:40.283
I mean, there was just usually a complaint, some...

25:41.123 --> 25:44.848
freshman was all upset about this or that and got the mother upset.

25:44.949 --> 25:48.774
But, you know, I'd look into it if it needed to be looked into.

25:49.275 --> 25:51.378
But no core member, student?

25:51.398 --> 25:56.065
Oh, I got a few obscene phone calls, you know, but I never knew who they were.

25:56.185 --> 25:57.847
And that would be quick and they'd hang out?

25:57.867 --> 25:58.929
Oh, yes, yes.

25:58.949 --> 26:00.591
But not too many of those, I mean, you know.

26:00.631 --> 26:06.219
Did anybody ever threaten you with any kind of a pipe bomb or any kind of prank?

26:06.239 --> 26:08.042
No, no, nothing I know of.

26:08.022 --> 26:16.210
On a Saturday, a home football Saturday, you got to campus about what time?

26:16.848 --> 26:21.333
It just depended on whether I had the general or not and what else I had to do.

26:21.353 --> 26:30.985
Of course, usually I had a lot of family that came in and, you know, the Corps didn't really need me over there to do anything other than I just liked to kind of be around when something was going on.

26:31.045 --> 26:33.748
So sometimes I'd go over, sometimes I wouldn't.

26:33.768 --> 26:35.390
It just depended on the circumstances.

26:35.410 --> 26:44.982
If it was the general, I would, you know, usually be taking care of the general and we would, sometimes we'd give them a briefing on Saturday morning, sometimes we wouldn't.

26:45.198 --> 26:49.044
Where would those reviewing officers stay when they were here?

26:49.265 --> 26:51.929
Well, usually we had a room in the MSC.

26:51.949 --> 26:52.950
Okay.

26:52.971 --> 26:56.496
And it was the host officer responsible for picking them up?

26:56.516 --> 26:56.656
Right.

26:56.676 --> 26:58.560
The host officer picked them up at the airport.

26:58.640 --> 27:06.953
They normally flew in, picked them up at the airport, took them to dinner that night, and kind of left them on their own for breakfast.

27:07.422 --> 27:10.466
you know, if they could be a general, they could find their way to the cafeteria.

27:11.727 --> 27:15.272
Now, if you were the host officer, where would you have taken them for dinner?

27:16.353 --> 27:18.015
What was the, what was the upscale place?

27:18.035 --> 27:23.962
There were not too many places like the Mexican place out on Highway 30.

27:24.983 --> 27:26.025
Jose's?

27:26.045 --> 27:26.605
Jose's.

27:26.786 --> 27:29.369
That was, that was a good place that you'd get into.

27:29.409 --> 27:36.197
One time I couldn't find any place to take General Hollingsworth, who was one of the notable

27:36.785 --> 27:39.448
notable generals that visited down here.

27:40.669 --> 27:43.471
And I took him to, at that time, Duchesne.

27:43.512 --> 27:46.054
There was a restaurant in Duchesne.

27:46.695 --> 27:53.421
And then there was TJ's, which was a good place, over at 707 across Texas, over there.

27:53.761 --> 28:00.408
And there just, at that time, there weren't too many places to take people.

28:00.768 --> 28:02.590
Never had any problems of

28:03.008 --> 28:06.792
General being late, the flight not making it, or?

28:07.112 --> 28:23.168
Well, the only time was General French, he was the commander of the ROTC program in this area in, you know, like seven to ten states around, you know, from New Mexico to Oklahoma, Kansas, all around.

28:23.208 --> 28:32.998
And we were having some bad weather, and I heard, and he called the afternoon before and had to cancel out, and then

28:33.333 --> 28:37.679
Somebody told me up there that the guy didn't like to fly, especially if it was bad weather.

28:37.819 --> 28:39.141
So that's the reason he canceled out.

28:39.161 --> 28:47.151
Well, I had had a dinner party, not a dinner party, but kind of a cocktail party prepared that night because he was our boss, see.

28:47.171 --> 28:56.183
And we're going to have all of our officers in and Army ROTC officers and a pretty good crowd, you know, to kind of honor General French.

28:56.984 --> 29:01.770
Well, my brother-in-law from Belton was coming down, Victor Means, Jr.,

29:02.780 --> 29:05.183
was coming down, he was going to spend the night with us.

29:05.203 --> 29:09.149
So when he got there, I said, okay, we called him Buddy.

29:09.209 --> 29:11.892
I said, Buddy, now here's what you've got to do.

29:11.993 --> 29:13.735
You've got to be General French.

29:14.877 --> 29:21.065
And so what we did, we introduced him to everyone as General French.

29:21.606 --> 29:27.734
Well, you know, after a while, everybody caught on, but in fact, a few of them knew General French.

29:27.854 --> 29:29.817
They knew that this wasn't General French.

29:29.999 --> 29:33.524
That's the only incident I had is where someone didn't show up.

29:35.467 --> 29:47.946
Now I had another general that had to cancel out at the last minute for a legitimate reason, so I called Fort Hood and talked to protocol people and I said, hey, I need a general.

29:49.088 --> 29:52.833
Send me a general down, you know, like this kind of, you know, rent a general.

29:53.414 --> 29:57.981
And they sent me down, a brigadier general came with his wife and son,

29:58.298 --> 30:10.194
next day, I mean he did it on short notice, but you know that's a good deal for especially somebody in Fort Hood to drive down and see a football game, go to the President's luncheon and review the troops and everything.

30:10.494 --> 30:20.307
Now, Corps members never attempt any good bull tricks or anything in a review as they approach the reviewing stand, do they?

30:20.860 --> 30:24.384
I don't think, I don't recall anything.

30:24.404 --> 30:25.465
I've never heard of any.

30:27.387 --> 30:33.454
That final review, there'll be, you know, sometimes there'll be something, but not when it's serious.

30:34.775 --> 30:45.106
And then Saturday, if it's a day football game, when did your weekend duties then taper off?

30:45.467 --> 30:46.528
When the football game's over?

30:46.568 --> 30:48.370
When the football game's over, yeah.

30:48.907 --> 30:52.474
And so then you go home and relax a little.

30:52.615 --> 30:55.340
You and your family, were you all church members here?

30:55.420 --> 30:55.661
Yes.

30:55.741 --> 30:56.202
Where'd you go?

30:56.422 --> 30:58.847
At the A&M Presbyterian Church up at the North Gate.

31:00.411 --> 31:00.952
Do you all go to?

31:01.593 --> 31:03.798
I go to A&M Presbyterian Church.

31:03.818 --> 31:06.443
Sold that land for a million and a half dollars

31:07.199 --> 31:13.827
joined in with a new church that was trying to get farmed out in South College Station and farm the Covenant Preparatory Church.

31:13.847 --> 31:14.608
How's that going?

31:14.628 --> 31:16.069
It's going very well, very well.

31:16.129 --> 31:18.973
Nice plans so far.

31:19.333 --> 31:28.163
We joined the church in Bryan in 1959, because I told my wife, we'll make friends in College Station anyway, let's broaden.

31:28.724 --> 31:29.865
And so,

31:30.200 --> 31:37.489
We've known a lot of people and have watched with interest, because that church is right near where we live, and drove by last night.

31:37.549 --> 31:45.439
Our granddaughter that I said is visiting, we drove by, and the low lights were on.

31:45.999 --> 31:49.163
It was about 8, 39 o'clock, and it looks very attractive.

31:49.183 --> 31:50.044
Yes, it's nice.

31:50.064 --> 31:50.745
It's gone well.

31:51.306 --> 31:55.431
It's sure better than the old 19...
