00:08.637 --> 00:12.843
I don't know how this is going to tie in with an 
article on Chad Oliver, other than it's your

00:08.637 --> 00:12.843
opinion.

00:15.947 --> 00:22.556
Well, I guess I ought to set the stage and qualify it 
a little bit. Never met John Kim.

00:26.682 --> 00:37.176
During the period that I was writing a lot for a 
Stanley Analog under various titles, John and I

00:26.682 --> 00:37.176
corresponded prodigiously. and I gather this is 
more or less a requirement if you're going to write

00:37.510 --> 00:48.665
for Campbell, is that you get involved in these 
endless arguments and discussion by mail. I don't

00:49.406 --> 00:50.688
know how he does it, you know. I mean, he used to send 
me fantastic letters, you know, 27 pages

00:50.788 --> 00:57.116
single-spaced. I remember one of them was, and 
this is a busy man, you know, I don't know how he does

01:00.275 --> 01:03.058
it. You know, John, he still reads, I guess, 
everything that comes in himself, unless it's

01:03.078 --> 01:10.207
just obviously illiterate. I guess that's what 
the assistant editor does, is weed out the stuff

01:10.267 --> 01:20.861
that is just hopeless, you know, and he reads 
everything else, and he writes tremendously

01:10.267 --> 01:20.861
about it. That's one qualification. The other 
qualification is that I, as I said, I haven't read

01:29.789 --> 01:38.019
or kept up with the field like I used to, and this 
includes the editorials and analog, which I

01:29.789 --> 01:38.019
suppose is what you're really talking about. So I 
can't comment very specifically. Let me just say

01:43.306 --> 01:56.082
this, that

01:43.306 --> 01:56.082
Camel was probably the single most influential 
man in the development of what we call modern

01:43.306 --> 01:56.082
science fiction. I mean, it seems to me this is 
beyond argument, but if Campbell had not come

01:59.168 --> 02:12.405
along when he did and done what he did with 
Astounding, the whole course of science fiction

01:59.168 --> 02:12.405
would have been, I think, radically different, 
and I think his influence was definitely

01:59.168 --> 02:12.405
beneficial. That isn't what you want me to say, I 
know, but apart from everything else, he was an

02:14.408 --> 02:21.777
amazingly creative editor. Not in the sense that 
Tony Boucher was. I mean, Campbell's talent is not

02:24.941 --> 02:28.686
in taking a manuscript, and saying, well, this is 
what's wrong with it. Do this, that, and the other,

02:32.776 --> 02:35.018
but we're going to do it your way. Campbell's 
talent is in finding writers and in stimulating

02:35.219 --> 02:40.946
them to make them want to write for him. And one way 
he does this, it's exactly the same way McAllister

02:41.607 --> 02:45.251
teaches. McAllister used to call it education by 
irritation. Campbell has exactly the same pitch.

02:52.300 --> 02:54.623
Well, what he does is he throws out these 
controversial statements and remarks, and where

02:54.856 --> 03:07.637
he gets you so mad that you sit down with a 
typewriter and write a story to refute him, or

02:54.856 --> 03:07.637
agree with him if that's the case, but in any case, 
he gets you involved. And after all, look at the

03:09.840 --> 03:12.945
writers that this guy found. It's fantastic. 
That's one side of Kim. I respect him, I admire him,

03:17.653 --> 03:20.357
I really do. I don't know. I suppose ultimately it 
comes down to what your view of science fiction is

03:22.069 --> 03:27.237
and how important you think it is. But if you once 
grant the premise that it is worth something,

03:27.877 --> 03:35.809
there's nobody that's more responsible for what 
it is today than John Campbell. Okay. Negative

03:37.271 --> 03:38.032
side. The thing that always annoyed me the most 
about John, and it's something that I... really

03:46.274 --> 04:05.073
found almost incomprehensible in a man who was a 
writer himself, and a rather good one too, not so

03:46.274 --> 04:05.073
much under his own name, but as Don Stewart, he 
wrote some fine things, is his total lack of

03:46.274 --> 04:05.073
concern with writing quality. He doesn't care, at 
least as far as I can determine, if he likes the idea

04:13.342 --> 04:20.854
And if it's written just well enough to hold 
somebody's attention, that's apparently all he

04:13.342 --> 04:20.854
demands. And I really am not sure that it's so much a 
hostility on John's part toward fancy writing,

04:21.835 --> 04:36.198
trick writing as he often calls it, literary 
writing, that sort of thing. I don't really think

04:36.519 --> 04:37.660
that's it. I think he just doesn't give a damn. And 
if he got a story that was written in trick prose and

04:39.987 --> 04:51.339
it happened to be about something that really 
punched one of his buttons and it was

04:39.987 --> 04:51.339
comprehensible to his readers, I guess he'd print 
it. But he's just not interested in writing. He's

04:54.983 --> 04:57.867
not interested in literary quality. And this I 
find hard to take. And it's one of the One of the

05:03.410 --> 05:11.502
reasons for the curious status of analog right 
now, and here's a magazine that in a way is the best

05:03.410 --> 05:11.502
magazine in the field. In a sense, I guess it still 
has a bigger circulation than any other science

05:12.023 --> 05:16.730
fiction magazine. You pick it up and there won't be 
a name on the contents page you ever heard of

05:16.750 --> 05:20.636
before. None of the big names in science fiction 
write for analog, and yet this is the showcase of

05:22.238 --> 05:29.008
the film. Maybe he knows what he's doing. With 
regard to the editorials, that's a different can

05:31.135 --> 05:34.079
of worms. John has always been or always liked to 
think of himself as being an iconoclast, an

05:36.443 --> 05:53.048
individual, idiosyncratic, always going 
against whatever the popular current might be. He

05:53.428 --> 05:54.991
has this image of himself. And I don't know. Nobody 
agrees with everything that John Campbell says. I

06:02.767 --> 06:06.291
doubt that John himself agrees with all of it. And 
the reaction I get is that John is one of these guys

06:07.393 --> 06:21.292
that just automatically opposes the popular 
point of view, whatever it is, the easy point of

06:07.393 --> 06:21.292
view, and is always trying to make an argument on 
the other side. I think a lot of what he says is

06:22.454 --> 06:25.759
highly dubious. The alleged racism, for example, 
A number of other things. I don't share John's

06:30.903 --> 06:38.130
interest in psi factors and all this stuff, and we 
used to argue endlessly about this. I think John

06:38.150 --> 06:46.197
has lots of peculiar ideas about history, for 
example, certainly about anthropology. But at

06:46.978 --> 06:50.181
the same time, you've got to say that this is no 
fool. A lot of what John says makes sense, even if he

06:51.302 --> 06:56.847
does push it further than most people would push 
it. And he does have a talent for not being

06:57.485 --> 07:11.119
impressed by a lot of fancy names, not being 
impressed by a lot of footnotes and verbiage, but

06:57.485 --> 07:11.119
going to the heart of the argument and saying, hey, 
wait a minute. Have you ever tried looking at it

07:11.139 --> 07:13.201
this way? And it's not a popular thing to do. It's a 
hard thing to do. And maybe it's worth doing,

07:17.465 --> 07:20.929
whether you agree with him or not. So what? What a 
terrible world this would be if everything was so

07:22.690 --> 07:25.433
blame him. that everybody had to agree with every 
statement that he makes. And God knows the remarks

07:29.418 --> 07:36.928
that Campbell makes aren't nearly as 
controversial as lots of remarks that are made on

07:29.418 --> 07:36.928
the other side. That's quite true. It's also a 
footnote becoming rather more respectable, some

07:37.328 --> 07:53.428
of it, in that for a long time John has questioned 
this idea that everything in human behavior is a

07:37.328 --> 07:53.428
matter of conditioning, a matter of culture, 
which was a stock involvement of the social

07:53.982 --> 07:56.406
sciences for years. Now on a popular level along 
come people like Robert Argery and Desmond

07:57.247 --> 08:11.151
Morris, and on a scientifically more respectable 
level I suppose you get people like Conrad Lorenz

07:57.247 --> 08:11.151
and a number of anthropologists, Sherry 
Warshburn, who are saying exactly the same thing.

08:12.052 --> 08:19.905
And John's arguments are not totally nonsense.

08:20.341 --> 08:22.344
and said he's taking his lumps now. Who's he taking 
them from and about what? Primarily these people

08:26.109 --> 08:34.081
you would classify as new waivers who are against 
the very things you've been talking about now.

08:34.281 --> 08:35.002
It's nothing new. It's been happening a while. And 
his magazine still has the highest circulation by

08:39.188 --> 08:42.352
far. John just doesn't care about that kind of 
writing. And as I say, maybe the guy knows what he's

08:46.679 --> 08:49.723
doing. Most people, when they pick up a magazine, 
they want to read a story. Most people, to tell you

08:54.134 --> 09:01.020
the truth, don't have any idea whether the writing 
quality is good, bad, or indifferent anyway, as

08:54.134 --> 09:01.020
long as they can get through it. But just the same, 
for a guy who was a writer, it's surprising he's not

09:02.821 --> 09:10.048
more concerned with it than he is. Given the 
choice, however, mind saying this, if I were just

09:10.068 --> 09:19.356
going to pick up one magazine to read on my way home 
tonight, it would probably be Analog.

09:25.664 --> 09:38.044
You

09:25.664 --> 09:38.044
haven't been, probably haven't seen the 
fantastic, I believe it is, where Alexia Panchin

09:25.664 --> 09:38.044
is getting into the criticism of science fiction. 
No, I have not. It's got an interesting series

09:39.427 --> 09:46.238
going there in that magazine, which you might find 
of interest in some kind. Well, yeah, thanks, I

09:46.458 --> 09:48.582
will. Yeah, we really... We almost never had a 
critic in science fiction, really, until Damon

09:53.474 --> 09:58.499
Knight came along. And I disagree emphatically 
with Damon. But he did some very worthwhile

10:03.544 --> 10:05.366
things. I think his essays on Van Vogt, for 
example. The only trouble with Damon's criticism

10:10.991 --> 10:17.278
is that he doesn't have the talent that Boucher 
had. He destroyed the writer. if you're at all

10:21.368 --> 10:28.977
sensitive to criticism, you know, you read what 
Damon has to say about you, gosh, you go slink away

10:21.368 --> 10:28.977
in the night and never write another line. Tony had 
this marvelous facility, you know, even if he

10:28.997 --> 10:39.509
didn't like something, of making you want to go on, 
and not only that, but helping you, giving you some

10:28.997 --> 10:39.509
concrete suggestions. The trouble with Damon, 
and don't quote this, please, I was asked to review

10:40.029 --> 10:48.439
a book of Damon's short stories one time by Doug 
Parker. who's now chairman of the classics

10:49.229 --> 10:51.371
department here. I don't know if you know Doug or 
not, he's a big science fiction fan. He was out at

10:54.293 --> 10:59.278
the University of California in Riverside where 
he had a book review column in the paper and

10:54.293 --> 10:59.278
reviewed science fiction. He asked me to review a 
book of Damon's one time and I finally just

11:00.539 --> 11:07.885
declined because I couldn't think of anything 
good to say about it. He admires a kind of a

11:08.846 --> 11:19.135
bloodless, technically expert, to me utterly 
trivial kind of a story. When you get to a question

11:20.110 --> 11:29.003
of anything about impact or something that hits 
the gut or something like that, Damon doesn't know

11:20.110 --> 11:29.003
what you're talking. He doesn't even know what 
you're trying to do, much less whether you

11:29.023 --> 11:33.409
succeeded or not. And I find it very debilitating. 
But just the same, until Damon came along, there

11:36.614 --> 11:44.205
was very little intelligent comment on science 
fiction. And what he has to say is intelligent.

11:46.088 --> 11:46.728
It's interesting. I just think he's dead wrong. 
That's it. Blish seems to be the primary critic

11:49.068 --> 11:52.392
right now. Yeah. Well, Blish is another one. I 
mean, who is James Blish? He's a James Joyce

11:57.599 --> 12:01.104
scholar, among other men. And if you've ever met 
Blish, or read anything about him, he's another

12:01.124 --> 12:13.139
one of these rather bloodless, terribly cerebral 
types. And, you know, is this all science fiction?

12:16.804 --> 12:17.505
You know, it It was a stock criticism that was 
leveled at science fiction for years, mostly by

12:17.924 --> 12:24.551
people who didn't know anything about it. But 
there is a grain of truth in it, that the one area

12:25.472 --> 12:31.438
that is so deficient is in characterization. 
There are no recognizable human beings in here. In

12:34.020 --> 12:41.728
fact, somebody once made the comment, fairly 
perceptively, that the robots and androids are

12:34.020 --> 12:41.728
the most human people in science fiction. And on 
the other hand, that it was... so terribly

12:44.047 --> 12:52.320
intellectual and cerebral that it just never had 
any force or power. And it seems to me that the ideal

12:53.241 --> 13:00.532
fiction of somebody like James Blish or Damon 
Knight is precisely this kind of fiction. It's

13:00.552 --> 13:01.113
dead. And you ask, well, what did Damon Knight ever 
write? The best story Damon ever wrote is a joke. I

13:09.906 --> 13:10.948
mean, literally a joke. You know, not with a bang. 
You know, the one about the last man and the last

13:15.365 --> 13:22.412
woman.

13:24.655 --> 13:29.781
Well, I suppose part of the problem is that you've 
got to face this about yourself. I'm the aberrant

13:29.921 --> 13:33.385
one. I'm quite unlike most science fiction 
writers that I know, for better or for worse. And

13:39.972 --> 13:40.733
I've... I've worked rather largely isolated from 
the mainstream, or whatever you want to call it.

13:48.610 --> 13:58.081
And my conception of what science fiction should 
be and the kind of book I want to write is very

13:48.610 --> 13:58.081
different from what most of them are trying to do. 
That's just the way it is. And I guess it's only

13:59.122 --> 14:04.569
natural that I happen to like what I'm trying to do, 
not saying I'm doing it correctly. And I've never

14:05.630 --> 14:10.095
read any criticism in science fiction. that 
really struck me as being addressed to the same set

14:11.054 --> 14:22.531
of problems that I would address if I were writing, 
but I'm not going to write, so I'm going to leave it

14:11.054 --> 14:22.531
at that. Maybe a loss for science fiction as a- You 
do have- Tony came closer.

14:32.086 --> 14:35.431
Tony wasn't a critic, he was a reviewer, his own 
phrase. But the great quality that he had was that

14:36.232 --> 14:39.357
he was so eclectic. The amazing thing about Tony 
was he could see merit in widely different types of

14:39.910 --> 14:45.640
stories. Tony would love anything from Mission to 
Gravity to More Than Human, you know, and see no

14:46.741 --> 14:55.336
problem there. If Tony were still alive, he'd love 
the new wave. I don't think there's any doubt about

14:58.421 --> 14:59.723
it. But at the same time, he'd like the old wave, 
too. And maybe that's what we need.

15:08.092 --> 15:14.540
But you know, this whole new wave business, you 
can't really divorce it from the rest of

15:08.092 --> 15:14.540
literature. It's really a sign that science 
fiction is less ingram than it used to be, and that

15:15.221 --> 15:33.103
you have a number of people who are writing science 
fiction, but aren't just science fiction

15:15.221 --> 15:33.103
writers, and they're concerned about what's 
happening in literature generally, whether you

15:15.221 --> 15:33.103
like it or not is another question. There's some 
modern things I like very much. I mean, apart from

15:37.122 --> 15:43.308
science fiction, although I'm terribly dated by 
modern things. I like Lawrence Durrell's

15:43.649 --> 15:47.693
Alexandria Quartet. I thought it was superb. And I 
don't know what the hell you'd call it, but it's

15:49.575 --> 15:53.839
certainly not a traditional piece of fiction. I 
like Catch-22. And I like Dyke's Rabbit Run,

15:56.422 --> 16:02.948
although I thought the big sex novel was a 
disaster. I think... What's the name of it?

16:05.748 --> 16:06.128
Couples. An utter mystery to me, how a guy with the 
talent that that guy has could write Couples,

16:07.149 --> 16:16.019
except I know the answer perfectly well, he made 20 
times. I was just going to say, great big dollar

16:16.039 --> 16:18.121
sign. But he can flat write, no question about

16:19.123 --> 16:27.312
it. This is probably the most disorganized 
interview you've ever conducted, if you can make

16:27.332 --> 16:33.178
head or tail out of this stuff. Well, I'm not an 
accomplished interviewer. It's probably

16:35.546 --> 16:36.527
obvious. I've not attempted it very often, and 
probably won't attempt it too much more. Well, I

16:42.615 --> 16:45.119
hope I haven't scared you off for the rest of your 
life. Oh, no. It's just an area you have to learn in,

16:46.340 --> 16:51.527
as anywhere else. No, you're doing fine. I meant 
that as a criticism of me, not of you. My voice is

16:56.554 --> 17:02.642
gradually... You're picking out a lot of... 
You're adding many things to the questions that

16:56.554 --> 17:02.642
really are... You'd get a messy answer. Yes or no of 
the witness, then. Just out of curiosity, and

17:08.928 --> 17:18.200
again, probably not related to the article, but 
have you done anything with your manuscripts, or

17:08.928 --> 17:18.200
have you made any plans to do anything with your 
manuscripts? No.

17:23.928 --> 17:29.355
It was only, well, I don't know, four years ago, 
something like that, but suddenly the notion

17:29.926 --> 17:34.011
percolated that these might have some value. And I 
haven't kept a tremendous amount from the early

17:35.352 --> 17:40.058
days. I've got some. I've got some boxes of stuff in 
Kerrville. I don't even know what's in them. But

17:47.767 --> 17:54.235
the last time I looked through there, there were a 
lot of original manuscripts and some working

17:47.767 --> 17:54.235
notes and things like that. But for the last four or 
five years, I've kept everything. I've kept

17:59.136 --> 18:08.649
working notes and first drafts and typescripts 
and notes to myself and everything else as I was

17:59.136 --> 18:08.649
working along on the stories. So I will have it in 
the future. In the past, it's pretty sporadic. I

18:14.858 --> 18:20.266
don't know what I've done, but I think I've got the 
original manuscripts of almost everything I've

18:14.858 --> 18:20.266
ever written. At least a carbon of it. As to what I'm 
going to do with them ultimately, I don't know. I

18:26.812 --> 18:40.508
was just curious, I know Syracuse is very actively 
interested in acquiring, and I know UT, of course,

18:26.812 --> 18:40.508
which you might have a particular feeling for, is 
very interested in keeping Texas writers at home,

18:26.812 --> 18:40.508
so to speak. When I was here and talking to people. I 
haven't, it really isn't even fair to say I haven't

18:45.714 --> 18:49.358
made a decision. I haven't even thought about it. 
I've just gotten to the point where I've stopped

18:52.522 --> 18:55.485
throwing things away. And what I would do with it 
ultimately, I just don't know. You worry about

19:01.251 --> 19:03.355
that ultimately. Yeah, I worry about it 
ultimately. I think a lot of it would really

19:05.799 --> 19:16.258
depend, just like any writer, on whether there was 
some place at some time that had a specific

19:05.799 --> 19:16.258
interest in my stuff. where I have a feeling that if 
I did give it or if they bought it or whatever they

19:17.217 --> 19:24.648
did with it, it wouldn't just sit in a box 
somewhere. It might be useful

19:25.208 --> 19:32.339
to someone. Outside of your personal papers, what 
sort of a science fiction library do you have? Do

19:38.668 --> 19:41.251
you still have your old pulps? Yeah, not here. I'm 
in the process of trying to design a study for

19:45.719 --> 19:50.925
myself. We've got 15 acres of land out here off BK 
Road, a very small house. I originally had one room

19:57.032 --> 20:01.638
in there I could use as a study, but that was before 
my son came along. He's three years old. Well, I've

20:03.420 --> 20:09.287
got now, I've got a desk and a bedroom, which is 
about where I started out years ago. And we just

20:09.327 --> 20:12.030
don't have a room. to store things in the house. But 
when I get the study built finally and I can get all

20:14.263 --> 20:18.107
the stuff together, I'll bring it up. It's almost 
all in Kerrville. And to answer that, I've got,

20:21.411 --> 20:31.501
during the period where I was reading everything, 
I kept everything. And from, well, I don't know,

20:31.521 --> 20:42.372
41, 42, whenever it was, on through, I guess, the 
middle 50s. I've got virtually everything.

20:49.791 --> 20:52.355
Magazines, paperbacks, hard bans, the works. 
Prior to that date, I have scattered stuff. I went

20:58.063 --> 21:03.952
back and I bought a lot of early amazing stories and 
wonder stories and weird tales and things like

20:58.063 --> 21:03.952
that. I kept all that. I'd say that the collection 
is probably very good. up through about maybe

21:12.794 --> 21:18.863
1955, 1956, and very scattered since then.

21:23.229 --> 21:34.245
I just don't buy anything like the number of books 
and magazines that I used to, but virtually

21:23.229 --> 21:34.245
everything I glom onto I keep. It's getting 
difficult to buy three or four hundred new books a

21:35.508 --> 21:38.913
year. It's fiction. Aside from the expenses. The 
early stuff, I think it would probably be a pretty

21:43.079 --> 21:48.006
interesting library. There's somebody in the, 
you know, I have things, you know, The Outsiders

21:48.106 --> 21:53.514
and things like that. In fact, I've got that whole 
early run up from Arkham House. And I've got things

21:57.399 --> 22:01.245
like Ray Cummings' old books, like, you know, The 
Conqueror, and The Sea Girl, and all that stuff,

22:01.546 --> 22:22.311
and all of Burroughs' stuff back in the old cloth 
band, the early editions, and just about

22:01.546 --> 22:22.311
everything else that popped up, all the early 
anthologies and things

22:01.546 --> 22:22.311
like that. That's good. I think that ought to tie it 
up for now. We've taken plenty of your time. It's

22:26.295 --> 22:28.498
been a pleasure. I hope I've given you what you want 
and not too much of what you don't want. Well, as I

22:33.070 --> 22:41.200
said, as is the case usually with me, I'll probably 
have to come back with some questions if you would

22:33.070 --> 22:41.200
not answer them. I'd be delighted. And I want to 
apologize and explain to you why I've been so

22:42.882 --> 22:49.130
difficult to get hold of. The bulk of it is simply 
the old stock story about I've been too busy. And

22:55.867 --> 23:11.277
the weekends, I've gotten to the point where I'm 
under so much pressure all week that come Saturday

22:55.867 --> 23:11.277
I just like to take off and what I'm doing is nothing 
more stimulating than going fishing. But I really

23:12.139 --> 23:17.048
have gotten to the point where I need it. So I'm not 
usually available on weekends, but where I am,

23:17.652 --> 23:23.058
it's down on the river. But I am sorry that it's 
taken so long to get together. Well, it's been no

23:26.822 --> 23:29.826
problem from my standpoint. I'll have to go over 
this many times, and I have the time, so no problem

23:30.506 --> 23:36.393
at all. I'm just hoping that I'm going to have the 
time in the next few years to get back and really do

23:36.914 --> 23:44.402
some rockin'. Well, six or eight novelettes are 
all worked up and ready to go with no time to write

23:45.817 --> 23:50.945
them. And I have a couple of other novels that I want 
to write. I think the next one probably will not be

23:56.413 --> 24:01.341
science fiction, but the one after that will be. 
And I don't know. Things are bound to be better in

24:05.947 --> 24:10.855
the next four years than they've been in the last 
four years. It's been a bit of a drag.

24:16.057 --> 24:20.182
Okay, well, I appreciate the problems of the 
department, Chairman.

24:22.285 --> 24:24.768
It's been fantastic. Not as bad in a way this year as 
the previous three because there's been so much

24:24.848 --> 24:31.817
chaos in the administration. This past year has 
almost been a holding operation where the big

24:33.419 --> 24:43.072
problem has been to avoid doing things because no 
matter what you try to do, you're going to turn

24:33.419 --> 24:43.072
them. In fact, well, let's just wait a while on 
that. But that can have its problems too. But for

24:48.774 --> 24:53.340
three years, I put in a long day every day in the 
office. You'd look back at the end of the day and ask

24:54.261 --> 24:58.526
yourself, well what the hell did I do that was 
useful? That's pretty hard to point at anyway. But

25:01.970 --> 25:02.671
it's ending. That's good. You're going back. 
There will be a new chairman. There'll be a new

25:07.597 --> 25:08.478
chairman. But actually, I'll be through as a or 
around the 1st of June because there will be an

25:13.347 --> 25:18.414
acting chairman that will take over the summit. 
Who's going to be the headman? Yes, his name is

25:20.678 --> 25:22.921
Jerry Epstein. Oh, Dr. Epstein is? Yeah, you know 
Jerry.

25:28.789 --> 25:30.912
Well, we can look forward to you having some time. 
Well, I hope so. It's bound to be more time than I've

25:32.595 --> 25:35.279
had anyway. I joined the N3F this past year for the 
first time just out of curiosity more than

25:35.299 --> 25:39.625
anything. I'm not really active in fandom other 
than the fact that it gives me a lot of information.

25:44.806 --> 25:46.770
It's been going on for a long time, you know. It 
really has. I'm learning more about it and

25:47.712 --> 25:50.358
becoming more interested. But among other 
things, I noted that I collected the works of Chad

25:50.458 --> 25:59.318
Oliver and in the welcome committee letters, many 
people commented that It's too damn bad, Chad

25:59.737 --> 26:03.380
Oliver's not writing some more. For what it's 
worth. I thank you for passing that on. You're not

26:06.924 --> 26:08.626
forgotten, that's for sure. Well, it helps to know 
that, believe me. I get letters occasionally from

26:13.070 --> 26:27.904
people who have read my stuff, and they always 
begin in effect like, gee, I apologize for

26:13.070 --> 26:27.904
imposing on your time, but I'd just like to say such 
and such, and my god, that's what you live for. I'm

26:28.306 --> 26:30.729
pleased that you liked it. If I understood you 
correctly, I don't know what kind of a reaction

26:31.429 --> 26:37.336
it's going to get. It's very odd. I'm indexing all 
reviews of science fiction books that appear in

26:41.841 --> 26:52.312
science fiction magazines and in Library Journal 
and Publishers Weekly and so forth, so I'll pass on

26:41.841 --> 26:52.312
any reviews that I run across. Just pass on a good 
one. The only bad thing about this book was that I

26:58.647 --> 27:16.791
wrote to Kay Kidd, who's the senior editor at 
Cigna, and a wonderful gal, and just been great to

26:58.647 --> 27:16.791
work with, and she just moved heaven and earth to 
get this published and hard down in this country,

26:58.647 --> 27:16.791
and it fell through at the last minute. But a 
wonderful gal, and I pointed this out to her. I

27:20.964 --> 27:22.106
wrote actually about it. One sentence was in 
there. Yeah, that's right. I wrote actually about

27:24.230 --> 27:30.680
the cover, and I said that I liked it a lot, and I'd 
like to get the original if I could. And I just

27:30.700 --> 27:36.349
mentioned that I wished I could say the same for the 
blurred copy. Specifically, it's not designed to

27:36.369 --> 27:42.559
appeal to anybody who might for any reason want to 
pick up the book. has nothing to appeal to a science

27:43.096 --> 27:52.729
fiction reader, has nothing to appeal to anybody 
who's interested in conservation, ecology,

27:43.096 --> 27:52.729
whatever you want to call it, which is a theme that 
runs all through. Instead, it's the killing time

27:52.769 --> 27:56.995
for the big people. What the hell was that? It's 
like you just thumbed through the book at random

27:57.495 --> 28:01.781
and picked out a sentence. Yeah, I think it's 
terrible. But the next, the other question I have

28:03.504 --> 28:09.812
is, they quote Anthony Belcher here, do you have 
Any knowledge of where or when that review? If I'm

28:12.876 --> 28:23.267
not mistaken, I

28:12.876 --> 28:23.267
think they've got it wrong in that I don't think 
that was in the New York Times, although it may have

28:12.876 --> 28:23.267
been. It may have been in connection with a review 
of one of my books. I think he wrote it in the

28:26.370 --> 28:31.255
magazine of fantasy and science fiction, where 
the quote actually came from. Bill Nolan dug it up

28:31.275 --> 28:38.483
and used it, I think, in Three to Three as a Highest 
Power, and that's where they picked it up. But if

28:39.138 --> 28:48.215
I'm not mistaken, it didn't come from the New York 
Times, except in the sense that he was working for

28:39.138 --> 28:48.215
the New York Times. My recollection of it is rather 
vague, but I think it was in the introductory blurb

28:48.235 --> 28:59.475
to one of my stories in Fantasy and Science Fiction 
that he originally wrote that. What would you say

29:00.063 --> 29:08.456
would be the reaction of Bill Nolan if we would 
write to him about your bibliography? See how many

29:08.817 --> 29:11.461
gaps we've got? I'm curious. We'd probably be 
told. Any idea where we might write him? Yeah,

29:16.749 --> 29:19.534
except I don't have it. I don't have his address 
here. I do at home. I'd be glad to call you. tomorrow

29:25.662 --> 29:27.064
and give it to them. I appreciate it. Just for 
goodness sakes, don't mention anything about my

29:27.805 --> 29:31.589
reactions. Oh no, I just said other than we visited 
with him and we've been trying to file one and a pair

29:32.210 --> 29:38.518
of notes or nothing else. I'm not sure he'd be doing 
it. And I'd be glad to give you his address. I'm

29:42.503 --> 29:43.585
sorry, I just don't have it. That's quite alright. 
I'd like to ask a favor of you. I gave this to Lan

29:46.909 --> 29:49.512
Hewlett, our academic counselor over there. I 
said give his regards. I know Lan. And a man Took it

29:53.017 --> 29:54.298
from my desk Saturday. He was helping us work at the 
basketball tournament. Took it home with him to

29:56.220 --> 29:57.541
finish reading. Didn't tell me about it. Told one 
of my bosses. And so he made a special trip home to

30:00.824 --> 30:06.709
get it today so I could bring it over and if you would 
autograph it for Lan. To Lan?

30:10.112 --> 30:10.252
Uh-huh. Here's a pen. Yeah, I need it. These 
paperbacks are...

30:20.240 --> 30:22.382
I saw that the, excuse me, the... We've thoroughly 
addicted him to your writing, by the way. I met him

30:26.200 --> 30:27.643
today for the first time. Oh, he's a nice guy. I'm 
sorry to hear about his wife. Yeah, that was at the

30:31.288 --> 30:36.656
UCLA football game just before the game began. She 
dropped dead of a heart attack. Yeah, I

30:38.038 --> 30:39.260
understand. Maybe I'd better borrow your pen. He 
was writing. Now,

30:43.887 --> 30:48.634
that explains his talent. He's left-handed, too. 
Aha! I accuse my wife, who's also left-handed, of

30:51.556 --> 30:54.759
having been born backwards. Well, I

30:55.160 --> 31:15.622
had a football coach in high school who used to say, 
Shad, as he always called me, you are no-handed.

31:15.642 --> 31:18.305
And in a way, it's the truth. I'm almost 
ambidextrous. I write left-handed, and I'm

31:21.172 --> 31:30.726
slightly better casting with a fly rod with my left 
hand, but I do almost everything else

31:21.172 --> 31:30.726
right-handed.
