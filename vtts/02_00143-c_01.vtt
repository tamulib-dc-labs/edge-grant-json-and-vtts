WEBVTT

00:03.305 --> 00:09.512
influenced some of the decisions that made A&M a 
better institution. All right. Can you think on

00:09.792 --> 00:10.913
that? Can you think of any time when the decision 
was in the lurch and some individual, you or

00:10.953 --> 00:27.472
somebody else, may have at a key moment made that 
decision?

00:32.778 --> 00:33.058
Work? Well, I guess in some ways it has to, I'm 
thinking several, because one of the lines that I

00:34.102 --> 00:55.232
used with a lot of prospective faculty members was 
that the thing I liked, one of the things I liked the

00:34.102 --> 00:55.232
most about ADN was that generally the 
administration, when you propose something to

00:34.102 --> 00:55.232
them, their first response was likely to be, let's 
see how we can make that work. And then after you

00:56.174 --> 01:00.703
looked into it carefully, there were times that 
you came up and said, we can't. But I found that so

01:01.785 --> 01:05.312
much more satisfying than saying, well, you know, 
why don't we? No, no, we've already done that

01:05.392 --> 01:08.658
before, and it didn't work, and we don't have the 
money to do it. So, you know, we just can't even

01:09.099 --> 01:11.584
think about that. At least let me finish my 
sentence and say what I think we ought to think

01:11.944 --> 01:14.850
about. No, we just can't do it. So again, I talked 
about some of the programs, tectonophysics and

01:19.208 --> 01:28.599
the nautical archeology program. There were so 
many programs that A&M got involved with that most

01:29.119 --> 01:38.430
universities couldn't have done. And the 
available fund was a critical factor in allowing

01:38.450 --> 01:44.457
us to do a lot of things. As you remember when you 
were here, Haskell, there were a lot of years that

01:45.027 --> 01:57.619
we were teaching more students without state 
subvention than were being taught at Prairie View

01:45.027 --> 01:57.619
and Tarleton combined. And we had a lot of growth 
and I think it was a, I think we did not lose a lot in

01:59.121 --> 02:09.751
the quality of what we were doing. But I think a lot 
of schools would have just been suffering from

02:14.761 --> 02:21.688
trying to do because of the resources we had and the 
support we had from the administration. And a lot

02:23.110 --> 02:26.213
of the board members were very pleased to see us 
grow. I remember, and you were involved a lot, I

02:26.233 --> 02:32.700
know, in trying to figure out how in the world we 
could ever get over the 20,000. How can we get to

02:34.462 --> 02:38.406
where we'll have 20,000 students? We'll beat the 
Bushes, and we'll do this, and we'll do that. And

02:41.634 --> 02:46.419
then when they came, they came in a rush. Just two or 
three more things. Can you think of any, as you look

02:49.001 --> 03:07.060
back, can you think of any event or decision with 
the benefit of hindsight, if you could have had

02:49.001 --> 03:07.060
omnipotence, at that point, do you go back and 
change that one?

03:11.562 --> 03:20.474
The one I guess I would achieve that I had nothing to 
do with it would be giving up the part of the state. I

03:20.494 --> 03:27.264
think that from a system point of view that was... 
What about any here? Be it personnel decisions or

03:27.284 --> 03:32.591
academic decisions? Well there are certainly 
some personnel decisions that I would have done

03:33.192 --> 03:38.599
differently but those are value judgments.

03:41.228 --> 03:42.630
I think I'll pass on those. As you look back, which 
are the dearest parts of the university to your

03:44.112 --> 03:50.141
heart? Which parts do you care most about?

03:56.550 --> 04:01.137
I guess, again, for a single event, the one that was 
most moving to me is Silver Taps. I just think that

04:02.799 --> 04:07.506
makes A&M truly unique as far as I know. I think a lot 
of the traditions of A&M are still very important.

04:15.183 --> 04:34.370
The thing that I fear we are not doing as well today, 
or they're not doing as well today, is the real

04:15.183 --> 04:34.370
concern for the undergrad students that seems to 
be less important today than it has been in the

04:15.183 --> 04:34.370
past. And I have believed for a long while that that 
administrators, university administrators,

04:36.950 --> 04:39.774
are really short-sighted.

04:42.558 --> 04:50.348
When they don't recognize that the best 
advertisement you get is a well-qualified,

04:42.558 --> 04:50.348
employed, satisfied graduate. And they're going 
to become taxpayers and some of them become

04:51.430 --> 04:54.694
legislators. And if they have very positive 
memories about their higher education

04:54.714 --> 05:00.942
experience, it's going to be a lot better. If they 
have very negative experiences, then they're

05:01.623 --> 05:05.809
going to pay a price sooner or later. And one of the 
things that I've probably inflicted on you that I

05:06.751 --> 05:22.397
really think has some substance is that 
intrastate your reputation built on high quality

05:06.751 --> 05:22.397
undergraduate education and applied research. 
But nationally and internationally, it's on

05:23.457 --> 05:28.363
basic research and graduate education. And so 
when you try to plug in both audiences, it's tough.

05:32.068 --> 05:33.830
But it's something I think can be done. And I think, 
again, A&M has the resources to do both. I don't

05:36.893 --> 05:40.097
think it has to be either or. Which unit or part or 
department of the campus do you care most about and

05:40.117 --> 05:52.873
kind of keep in touch with how it's progressing if 
you read the paper or talk to people? But one of the

05:53.647 --> 06:04.162
things that I believe is true is that I always had a 
concern for the entire university. I never felt

06:04.862 --> 06:11.632
parochial, and that's a strength and a weakness 
because even when I had nothing to do, I was still

06:04.862 --> 06:11.632
interested in the student life. I think that's 
very important, the second curriculum and all

06:12.613 --> 06:18.321
those things. even though I had no direct 
involvement. But I always admired the history

06:20.704 --> 06:22.406
department. I'm not saying it's because you're 
here. But for a long time, I think it was generally

06:24.428 --> 06:35.820
conceded that the best teaching in the university

06:24.428 --> 06:35.820
was done in the history department. But even when I 
had nothing to do with history, I admired the fact

06:35.840 --> 06:45.270
that there was really high quality teaching done 
in the history department. I am certainly not a

06:46.010 --> 06:54.080
scientist nor an engineer, but I take great pride 
in the reputation of science and engineering at

06:46.010 --> 06:54.080
Texas A&M. I take great pride in the reputation I 
think the vet school has had. So again, I'd like to

07:01.709 --> 07:09.819
live in the reflected glory of A&M. And so I want 
them to do whatever they do well. And one of the

07:14.562 --> 07:20.067
things, again, I think you and I talked about, I 
just like when people think of A&M as a class place.

07:21.228 --> 07:24.271
Last, your favorite Aggie story. My favorite 
Aggie story is at the adjunct when I was the

07:24.291 --> 07:31.858
director. At that point, we sent out mid-six weeks 
grades. So at the end of the three weeks, we sent out

07:38.444 --> 07:41.547
grades. We had a kid named Jack Abbott from down in 
the valley. really nice young man, not a great

07:45.022 --> 07:49.126
student. And he was not doing well. And as soon as 
the male could get to the valley and the woman could

07:51.809 --> 08:00.437
drive up in a big, big Cadillac, she was there. And 
she came in and she was very, very nicely dressed.

08:06.543 --> 08:10.827
And she came in to see me to talk about her son.

08:11.633 --> 08:24.270
So I told her, I said, you know, Jack is a really fine 
young man, and he is a good hurdler, but I really

08:11.633 --> 08:24.270
don't believe he's ready for Texas A&M right now. 
And she said, well, what do you think he ought to do?

08:27.394 --> 08:32.280
And I said, well, you know, that's got to be his 
choice and your choice. But if you ask me, I would

08:32.300 --> 08:41.472
think it might be worthwhile for him to consider a 
good community college and get the basic courses,

08:32.300 --> 08:41.472
a little more maturity, get him to his major where 
he'd be more interested and do better. Which

08:46.208 --> 08:49.212
junior college do you think he ought to go to? You 
know, that's your choice. But I said, you know,

08:50.955 --> 08:53.879
since you've asked, I'll take it. The students 
from Blinn have tended to do well when they

08:53.899 --> 08:57.844
transferred to Indian. I said, they've got that 
two-timing approach over there, and they run a

08:57.864 --> 09:02.290
pretty tight ship that's close to Indian. They get 
to visit friends, be involved. I said, so that

09:04.593 --> 09:06.936
would be one he might want to consider. And she 
said, Dr. McKinney, I don't care who my son

09:08.502 --> 09:12.047
marries. And I don't care what church he attends. 
But he will graduate from Texas A&M. And he did. He

09:22.162 --> 09:23.143
went to Blinn. I heard he got sick over there. His 
mother grew up in the valley. Ran two motel rooms.

09:29.292 --> 09:31.656
She got all his homework assignments. Helped him 
all that. And he came over here, ran track,

09:32.777 --> 09:34.780
lettered. He graduated, but I'll never forget 
that line. I don't care who he marries or what

09:39.794 --> 09:43.764
church he attends, but he will graduate from Texas 
A&M. Thank you.
