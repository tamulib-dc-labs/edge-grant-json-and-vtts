00:06.140 --> 00:15.893
April 26, 1986, interview with Henry Tom Heyer, 
Vietnam veteran, Marine Corps helicopter pilot.

00:20.399 --> 00:25.646
OK, Tom, how did you happen to be in the service? 
Were you drafted or volunteered? Well, after I

00:28.810 --> 00:35.218
finished college in August

00:28.810 --> 00:35.218
of 1965, I immediately got an induction notice 
from the Army. And knowing that if I was drafted as

00:41.387 --> 00:53.444
such, that I wouldn't have any choice as to what my 
job would be in the service. And I had also always

00:54.726 --> 00:59.473
sort of wanted to fly. And I thought this might be a 
good opportunity. So rather than letting the Army

01:02.137 --> 01:05.442
draft me, I volunteered for the Air Force and I went 
ahead and took the Air Force entrance exams and the

01:05.810 --> 01:34.568
Air Force physical and would have been accepted 
however they had filled their quota so they

01:05.810 --> 01:34.568
wouldn't take me and in the meantime I had gone up 
for my induction physical and all that and was

01:05.810 --> 01:34.568
about to receive orders to report and I got a phone 
call from the Marine recruiter and he said that he

01:34.835 --> 02:02.040
had access to the Air Force test and the like and 
that if I would consider being in the Marine Corps

01:34.835 --> 02:02.040
that they would try to get me into the air wing and 
use the Air Force test and the Air Force physical so

01:34.835 --> 02:02.040
I wouldn't have to go through all that again. So I 
went ahead and joined the Marine Corps. And

02:06.986 --> 02:14.054
actually signed papers in October of 65 and 
reported for duty in January of 66.

02:16.838 --> 02:28.872
And

02:16.838 --> 02:28.872
went through officer's school in Quantico, 
Virginia in January, February and March of 66.

02:32.108 --> 02:42.257
And then when I received my commission in March of 
66, I reported for flight school. Let's see. It was

02:45.240 --> 02:47.202
in May, May of 66. In the meantime, I stayed up in 
Quantico with some other officers waiting for

02:47.362 --> 02:55.489
orders to report to flight school. And

02:56.450 --> 03:01.795
got married. in the meantime also and reported to 
Pensacola, Florida in May. I think it was around

03:08.427 --> 03:20.503
May the 15th, I'm not really sure about the date, 
and went through flight school and ended up in

03:08.427 --> 03:20.503
helicopters. There was a division in flight 
school from, you could go for jets or helicopters

03:21.104 --> 03:30.837
and, but the cutoff for jets was pretty high and 
didn't quite make it so they went to helicopters

03:31.222 --> 03:55.896
and actually ended up in reporting in Vietnam I 
believe it was Halloween day in 1967 and

03:31.222 --> 03:55.896
was in

03:31.222 --> 03:55.896
Nam from

03:58.643 --> 04:12.679
October 67 to November 68,

03:58.643 --> 04:12.679
during which time was

03:58.643 --> 04:12.679
the now famous Tet Offensive.

04:18.005 --> 04:23.911
About where were you stationed,

04:18.005 --> 04:23.911
and if more than one place, can you tell us that? 
Yeah, when I originally reported into Vietnam,

04:29.103 --> 04:45.887
flew into Da Nang, and from there went to, of course 
it was just the next day, went to Phu Bai and joined

04:29.103 --> 04:45.887
HMM 362 helicopter squadron. And stayed in Phu 
Bai,

04:45.907 --> 04:52.697
let's see, until I believe it was about mid-March 
of 68.

04:59.918 --> 05:22.245
And from Fubai, one aboard ship, I'd get them mixed 
up whether it was on the Iwo Jima first or the

04:59.918 --> 05:22.245
Princeton, but one or the other one aboard ship,

04:59.918 --> 05:22.245
the squadron was actually aboard ship until I 
believe it was about September of 68. So from March

05:22.445 --> 05:38.269
to September we were aboard ship and when we 
disembarked we went to Marble Mountain which was

05:22.445 --> 05:38.269
just outside of Da Nang and operated in the 
southern part. I call it the southern, it's still

05:39.050 --> 05:50.528
the northern part of South Vietnam but as far as I 
Corps was concerned it was the southern part.

05:53.478 --> 06:00.067
While operating in Fubai, we had medevac. It was 
mainly medevac and CNC. CNC being command and

06:04.653 --> 06:07.678
control. Also called in the ranks the Ragpicker 
Express, where you'd go.

06:19.853 --> 06:20.834
I flew the H-34. It's a Sikorsky,

06:21.515 --> 06:29.004
antiquated Sikorsky helicopter. And it was the 
last of the reciprocating engine helicopters.

06:34.771 --> 06:38.054
And it was the best bullet bouncer in the world. It 
had this big R-18-20 engine sitting right there in

06:38.235 --> 06:46.625
front of you for your bullet bouncer. But we ran 
like I said, medevac and CNC. And the CNC part was we

06:52.664 --> 07:13.553
might go to Da Nang and we would fly wing them on a 
Huey, which would have some kind of brass, a kernel

06:52.664 --> 07:13.553
or very seldom in general, but flying around to 
different locations, checking on different

07:15.305 --> 07:26.339
headquarters and the like. Pick them up in Da Nang 
and fly them up to Phu Bai or Quang Tri or Dong Ha, and

07:26.780 --> 07:45.143
they would check on operations there with the 
command, and then fly them back home, and that

07:26.780 --> 07:45.143
would be home being Da Nang. That'd be a full day's 
operation for us. And other than that, we would

07:50.459 --> 07:57.689
have an occasional recon insert or extract.

08:00.613 --> 08:08.163
But you could probably say the main priority of our 
squadron was medevac. Actually, my first flight

08:10.326 --> 08:15.433
in country was medevac.

08:17.590 --> 08:24.358
We had, well I was there for I guess maybe two days 
before I actually did any flying. And I

08:26.720 --> 08:47.023
can't remember the lieutenant's name that I went 
out with on that first flight, but it was quite a

08:26.720 --> 08:47.023
memorable experience in the fact that we went to, 
we were operating out of Quang Tri. Well, of course

08:53.088 --> 09:16.538
our squadron was based in Phu Bai, but we would send 
out different aircraft to different operating

08:53.088 --> 09:16.538
areas to run medevac and that day we were running 
out of Quang Tri and

08:53.088 --> 09:16.538
our first evacuation was 16

09:18.188 --> 09:36.629
KIAs and about 20 wounded and it was quite a 
gruesome awakening for your first flight in

09:18.188 --> 09:36.629
country, you know, to think that boy, you know, I 
hope the hell is not like this the whole 13 months.

09:36.649 --> 09:39.231
Was it all United States people? Yeah, right. It 
was all Marine Corps. We were, it was strictly

09:41.995 --> 09:45.418
Marine Corps in that area. At that time the Army had 
not moved in at all.

09:50.690 --> 10:19.498
but that really and truly that was a rude awakening 
but I can't remember right off the top of my head

09:50.690 --> 10:19.498
that we had a worse day after that we had some more 
some days with more action in them but never had a

09:50.690 --> 10:19.498
day where we evacuated that many KIAs out of one 
zone. It was pretty gruesome, where

10:26.635 --> 10:34.623
it was. What was your opinion of the one-year tour 
of duty for the US soldiers? Well,

10:40.489 --> 10:49.958
at least having a definite time span, you felt like 
that you had a target to shoot for and that you were

10:50.933 --> 11:03.950
going to come home, versus like in World War II and 
the like, where people spent years over there.

11:04.350 --> 11:05.511
Stayed in for the duration. Right, and had no idea 
when they would be able to come home. But then

11:10.598 --> 11:20.130
again,

11:10.598 --> 11:20.130
well, just like reporting for anything the first 
time, When you first got there, you had a vague idea

11:20.971 --> 11:28.960
because you had indoctrination before you went. 
You had a vague idea about how it was going to be.

11:36.208 --> 11:41.834
But starting from day one, it's a learning 
experience no matter what people tell you. And you

11:43.275 --> 11:50.303
fall into the routine, you get the idea of

11:52.747 --> 11:58.695
what's actually going on, even though you don't 
really have a real good idea of why you're there.

12:00.898 --> 12:08.048
But you get to know the people in your outfit and 
what your daily routine is. And over a period of

12:09.370 --> 12:15.478
time, you get more proficient at your job. Being a 
helicopter pilot,

12:16.860 --> 12:22.568
when I went to Vietnam, I believe I had like 125 
flight hours. And when you get to 500 flight hours,

12:29.727 --> 12:40.502
you are eligible to be a HACC, which is a helicopter 
aircraft commander. Prior to that, you're a H2P,

12:42.444 --> 12:48.052
which is a helicopter second pilot. So during 
those first 500 hours, You're

12:53.868 --> 12:58.573
sitting second seat. You're learning. Of course, 
you definitely have responsibilities and the

13:00.856 --> 13:16.973
like, but it's a learning process before you get to 
the position of 500 hours and being an aircraft

13:00.856 --> 13:16.973
commander. Which takes a while. I can't remember 
exactly when I did become a hack.

13:28.916 --> 13:39.953
But let's see, it was probably around in February, 
making me have been there, what, November,

13:28.916 --> 13:39.953
December, January, about four months. It may have 
been before that, I don't know.

13:47.581 --> 13:50.825
During this time, you're learning, you're 
getting proficient at your job. You're learning

13:52.928 --> 13:54.851
the ins and outs of everything. And then you

13:55.912 --> 14:08.690
get to a point to where you are about as proficient 
as you're going to get at that particular job. And

14:13.130 --> 14:34.599
Not so much in the case of helicopter pilots, but 
evidently but occasionally it does happen where

14:13.130 --> 14:34.599
you would get a helicopter aircraft commander be 
drawn out of that particular MOS and being sent to

14:13.130 --> 14:34.599
another school to be a forward observer. And what 
is MOS? That's military occupational specialty.

14:44.062 --> 14:45.925
My MOS was helicopter pilot. Then you had changes 
of MOS, like just referred to going to a

14:48.208 --> 15:08.236
forward observer or whatever. H2P? No. No, H2P is 
helicopter second pilot. Yeah, but

15:14.658 --> 15:35.765
so during this period of time, the person may be 
drawn out to be a forward observer, and then that

15:14.658 --> 15:35.765
might be a three-month stint, then put back into a 
squadron. During that time, well, when you put

15:37.087 --> 15:40.191
back in a squadron, you haven't forgotten how to 
fly, but you're still going to have another period

15:42.145 --> 16:00.573
of learning experience,

15:42.145 --> 16:00.573
which knocks off the productivity of the 
individual because they've been away from their

15:42.145 --> 16:00.573
job for a while. Also, along

16:02.416 --> 16:07.343
this line,

16:09.770 --> 16:32.333
with having a specific time span to spend in 
Vietnam,

16:09.770 --> 16:32.333
you lose some proficiency in the fact that after a 
person gets halfway,

16:09.770 --> 16:32.333
they're thinking that it's downhill from then on. 
They're looking to go home. They start being a

16:34.215 --> 16:36.317
little more conservative. The closer you get to 
going home, the more conservative you get.

16:47.822 --> 16:50.205
In the air wing, we really had it. It was pretty well 
understood that you were going to perform the

16:51.927 --> 16:58.976
whole way through. In our squadron, anyway, you

16:59.777 --> 17:05.764
flew right up until the last week. If you made it 
that far, they'd give you the last week off. You

17:12.252 --> 17:21.224
might have an easy CNC run or something like that, 
but they'd definitely take you off of medevac.

17:22.345 --> 17:30.115
But then there were definitely some people who 
just flat, if they were on medevac, They wouldn't

17:30.584 --> 17:32.626
take that extra little edge. They wouldn't go that 
extra little bit to try and go in and pick somebody

17:32.666 --> 17:40.154
up if the zone was hot.

17:43.578 --> 17:44.899
Even when they were ordered to? Right. Of course, 
it's

17:45.860 --> 17:57.773
hard to say that you were ordered to because it was 
I'd say 98% of the time, pilot discretion as to

17:59.187 --> 18:16.147
whether you would go into an LZ or not, whether you 
would jeopardize yourself, your machine, and

17:59.187 --> 18:16.147
your crew to go in and pick up possibly one person.

18:20.592 --> 18:25.718
Prime cases of this, prime instances,

18:29.242 --> 18:55.722
There were a few times, and I say few because there 
were definitely more than one, where, and it

18:29.242 --> 18:55.722
always seemed to happen on night medevac, you'd 
get an emergency medevac, go in and pick up the guy,

18:29.242 --> 18:55.722
taking all kinds of chances because you'd be, the 
only thing, the only lighting you would have to go

18:29.242 --> 18:55.722
into an LZ would be maybe a heat tab or, or if you were 
lucky, a flashlight or something like that.

18:59.836 --> 19:00.637
What's a heat tab? Okay, a heat tab is a little 
tablet that, it's a phosphorus-type tablet you

19:00.837 --> 19:14.575
would use to heat your C-rations. And it gives off a 
small glow. It's mostly heat, but there is a blue

19:18.260 --> 19:21.704
flame to it. And you can see it a little bit, but not 
very well from the helicopter. Okay. And it's not

19:26.684 --> 19:29.368
much of a navigational device. The heat tabs will 
be on the ground there. Right, right. And so you try

19:33.373 --> 19:48.853
to find your LZ with the help of a heat tab and go and 
pick up somebody like that maybe suffering from a

19:33.373 --> 19:48.853
case of malaria. And like I say, that happened on 
more than one occasion. And it's a damn shame

19:53.299 --> 19:56.303
that... You would have to go in at night, 
especially, risking the crew and the helicopter.

20:05.250 --> 20:15.982
And possibly even, if you missed the zone, crash 
into some of the troops or something for somebody

20:05.250 --> 20:15.982
with a cotton pick in case of malaria. Actually,

20:17.564 --> 20:26.914
we lost

20:17.564 --> 20:26.914
one entire crew. I don't know if the reason for the 
medevac is lost in my mind right now because of the

20:28.615 --> 20:45.612
circumstances that came afterwards. But we had an 
entire crew go out on a night medevac, and they were

20:45.712 --> 20:57.323
being vectored by the ground control by radar. And 
they vectored them right into the side of a

20:59.142 --> 21:02.246
mountain. And we lost the whole crew. But I don't 
know, perhaps that night it was a real emergency, a

21:04.229 --> 21:13.902
do or die situation for the person on the ground. 
Like I say, I don't remember. But we did lose a

21:16.605 --> 21:22.934
complete crew because of that. Whose fault it was, 
you really can't say. But things like that you

21:28.268 --> 21:34.414
reflect back

21:28.268 --> 21:34.414
on. How about after the halfway point? Were there 
any changes personally in your attitudes or what

21:36.937 --> 21:44.244
you did? Well, a

21:46.166 --> 21:57.398
person really doesn't have to admit that maybe 
they had a little drop in their enthusiasm about

21:57.597 --> 22:26.794
doing their job but I'm sure to a certain extent 
most everyone has some drop in enthusiasm and like

21:57.597 --> 22:26.794
I mentioned before looking forward to that going 
home date and taking a little bit less of a chance

21:57.597 --> 22:26.794
but then again there are There are others who go for 
it all the way. One of the crew, one member of the

22:31.196 --> 22:42.613
crew that was killed in that incident I just 
mentioned was a major, and he was due to go home the

22:31.196 --> 22:42.613
next week.

22:45.457 --> 22:46.759
Sort of a sad situation. He really shouldn't have 
been on night medevac that night anyway, but I

22:46.819 --> 22:52.107
think he volunteered for it. And that's just one of 
the breaks of the game. If you're going to go,

22:54.933 --> 22:56.335
you're going to go. So I guess you might as well put 
out the whole way. But it's

22:58.978 --> 23:15.379
a strong,

22:58.978 --> 23:15.379
what would you say, tendency to protect yourself. 
And when you reach the halfway point, you're

23:16.621 --> 23:21.267
halfway home. and halfway home is what you're 
thinking about.

23:26.398 --> 23:31.204
Were you familiar with defoliation, and did you 
see any effects of it? Well, I don't know if you

23:33.006 --> 23:48.823
could really, if I could really say that it was 
actually defoliation or not, but I know when I

23:33.006 --> 23:48.823
first got to Vietnam, I was really impressed with 
how beautiful the countryside was. It was really

23:49.698 --> 23:56.867
lush and green, and no doubt about it, it was a 
beautiful country.

24:00.070 --> 24:16.650
Later on in my tour of Haiti, and especially 
towards the end of it, it was quite evident how much

24:00.070 --> 24:16.650
effect the war had on the country, just in the 12 to 
13 months that I was there.

24:18.284 --> 24:21.427
I believe actually in the area that we were in. 
Which area was that? From Da Nang north. Da Nang up

24:31.216 --> 24:35.841
through Fu Bai, Quang Tri, and Khe Sanh. All up in 
that area, the countryside seemed to be just

24:36.862 --> 24:47.532
totally pockmarked with B-52 strikes. It was just 
devastating how much effect it had on it, just

24:48.423 --> 24:56.951
crater after crater. You mean that would be the 
effects of rolling thunder? We weren't familiar

25:02.196 --> 25:06.980
with that terminology, but right.

25:10.523 --> 25:17.029
It was really fascinating, though, how beautiful 
the country was to begin with. And then after,

25:17.988 --> 25:21.933
towards the end, you saw the destruction. 
Absolutely. So you really didn't notice

25:24.677 --> 25:33.449
defoliation and the leaves falling off the trees 
to be able to help you see better on the ground? No,

25:34.551 --> 25:35.532
not really. Any of the LZs or landing zones that we 
went into were, of course, I don't know, when

25:35.612 --> 25:46.948
you're down there, In a zone, picking up somebody, 
you're not really looking at the scenery too

25:48.042 --> 25:51.986
terribly much. It could have been evident in me not 
noticing it at the time. The only time I really

25:59.693 --> 26:07.160
noticed the countryside was flying at altitude, 
you know, going from one place to another. And

26:07.200 --> 26:15.788
whether it was actually from defoliation or not, I 
couldn't say.

26:18.805 --> 26:23.012
Okay, you mentioned earlier flying alongside the 
Hueys. Can you describe the differences between

26:23.653 --> 26:30.143
the H-34 helicopters you flew and the Hueys? Well, 
the H-34, it's an antiquated aircraft. It's

26:39.898 --> 26:42.563
completely retired now, I do believe. But like I 
mentioned then, it was a It had a reciprocating

26:46.835 --> 26:52.060
engine versus a jet engine like the Huey has.

26:54.222 --> 26:56.265
What does reciprocating engine mean? Gasoline 
piston driven.

27:00.909 --> 27:01.650
Not as powerful? Pound for pound, much less 
powerful.

27:08.417 --> 27:16.605
We had a faster reaction time as far as the engine 
was concerned than a jet.

27:19.943 --> 27:25.592
The Huey, of course, is a much more up-to-date 
aircraft. Being jet propelled and the like, it's

27:26.573 --> 27:31.641
more maneuverable. And of course, it has higher 
technology in it, more sophisticated weaponry

27:33.084 --> 27:41.056
and the like. It's a more stable platform for the 
weaponry. The H-34, we had a crew of the pilot,

27:48.412 --> 27:58.361
co-pilot, crew chief, and a gunner. And when we had 
medevac, we also had a corpsman aboard. The crew

28:04.607 --> 28:10.713
chief and the gunner both had M60 machine guns. 
It's a .30 caliber machine gun. And mounted in the

28:13.676 --> 28:17.980
windows. And

28:18.837 --> 28:27.010
crew chief on one side, gunner on the other, so they 
could cover both sides of the aircraft. Of course,

28:27.030 --> 28:36.686
the Huey, they were much more versatile than the 
fact that some of them had rocket pods. Some of them

28:37.667 --> 28:40.893
had a Gatling gun. The Huey Cobra gunship. It had 
the whole smear. It was a two-man army right there.

28:57.039 --> 29:12.093
Our squadron was strictly H-34s, what you would 
call a utility squadron, I guess, in the fact that

28:57.039 --> 29:12.093
we did a little bit of everything, but we were not an 
arsenal. We had no firepower. We had the two M60s

29:14.795 --> 29:17.337
for defense, and that was it. We were there for 
extracting the wounded. We

29:23.003 --> 29:29.449
put in some recon patrols. We would take out some 
recon patrols.

29:35.735 --> 29:40.600
But it was strictly plain vanilla as far as the 
aircraft was concerned.

29:45.406 --> 30:00.424
What was your opinion of the Vietnamese,

29:45.406 --> 30:00.424
such as the South Vietnamese, North Vietnamese, 
and the Viet Cong, and any

29:45.406 --> 30:00.424
contact you had with them? How did you view them? 
Did you view them as humans? How did you look at

30:05.250 --> 30:08.794
them? Well, my contact with the Vietnamese of any 
sort was very limited. We had hooch maids, like I

30:15.578 --> 30:37.149
imagine most servicemen did over there, by the 
fact that there were six or eight of us living in one

30:15.578 --> 30:37.149
little old

30:15.578 --> 30:37.149
built-up shack, which we called Hooch's. And I 
believe I believe the fee for a hooch made was

30:41.633 --> 30:45.478
somewhere around $30 a month. I'm not sure, but I 
believe that sort of rings a bell. So you divide

30:49.283 --> 30:54.090
that up with five or six people, and it's pretty 
cheap to get your... The building swept out every

30:56.714 --> 31:04.344
day, and they'd polish your boots, and they'd do 
your washing and stuff like that. So it was quite

31:04.464 --> 31:06.567
reasonable. And that was really the only contact 
that I had with the Vietnamese... actually on a

31:11.620 --> 31:38.725
person to person type basis and those women really 
well they didn't speak English to begin with I

31:11.620 --> 31:38.725
really didn't have any desire to try to carry on any 
kind of a conversation with them anyway and

31:11.620 --> 31:38.725
so that was really about the extent of my contact 
with the Vietnamese as such. In observing,

31:42.540 --> 31:51.734
though, we would fly in from place to place and land 
in from place to place. And going to the exchange in

31:51.814 --> 32:05.995
Da Nang, where we did our shopping for various 
sundry items, there were some Vietnamese around

31:51.814 --> 32:05.995
there.

32:09.603 --> 32:18.352
The kids might come up to you a little bit, just like 
they do in Mexico, wanting something for nothing.

32:18.372 --> 32:28.163
But from stories that I heard prior, it was best to 
leave them alone. And if you could at all do it in any

32:28.704 --> 32:37.433
way at all, you had to avoid them. Cotton picking 
kids coming up with grenades in their hands and

32:37.835 --> 32:47.806
stuff like that and just booby trapping you or 
throwing one in the helicopter while you're

32:37.835 --> 32:47.806
sitting there waiting for somebody else to come 
along. And it, for all practical purposes, you

32:48.867 --> 32:54.273
wanted to stay away from it. As a people, I would say 
they were very, very backward type people.

33:07.062 --> 33:12.789
I would say probably upwards of 80% of the people. 
It seemed like everywhere we were, anyway, that

33:13.510 --> 33:25.324
maybe we were just coming in contact or observing

33:13.510 --> 33:25.324
the downtrodden portion of them. But I'm sure that 
the Vietnamese people as a whole were

33:25.344 --> 33:29.448
downtrodden. But one thing really strikes me, a 
couple of things, actually. as to the type of

33:35.598 --> 33:37.921
people that they were. The

33:37.961 --> 33:54.422
women,

33:37.961 --> 33:54.422
they'd be out in the field gathering rice or 
gathering firewood or whatever for their little

33:37.961 --> 33:54.422
cook fires and stuff. And

33:54.442 --> 34:02.112
if they had to go to the bathroom, it was amazing.

34:03.172 --> 34:07.676
You know, they wore the black pajamas and all that, 
the silken type pajamas. And they'd just roll up

34:07.696 --> 34:14.783
their leg, the leg of the pajamas, and pull it over 
the side and stand up and pee. Just like a cow

34:14.823 --> 34:18.267
pissing on a flat rock is amazing. You know, you 
can't have any respect for people that do that kind

34:18.807 --> 34:25.934
of thing. How about taking a crab? Well, they

34:27.696 --> 34:32.841
had a morning ritual. Actually, the only time I 
observed it was after we were off ship and we were

34:33.158 --> 34:44.171
based at Marble Mountain. And Marble Mountain is 
right outside of Da Nang, so it's a pretty heavily

34:44.992 --> 34:53.081
populated area. And early in the morning, around 
between 7 and 8, you'd fly around to the north of Da

34:53.862 --> 35:02.912
Nang And Da Nang was actually a harbor city, or I 
guess you'd call it a city. And the northern beach

35:09.343 --> 35:14.511
was commonly called Shit Beach. You'd fly there 
between 7 and 8 o'clock in the morning, and that's

35:16.514 --> 35:21.360
when everybody gets up. And they go out there, and 
they take a crap out there right in the tidal

35:21.981 --> 35:27.489
waters. Men and women? Men and women, kids, 
everybody. And they'd just be lined up along the

35:32.305 --> 35:40.112
beach, taking a crap out there in about a foot of 
water and expecting the tide to take it out. And I

35:40.933 --> 35:43.035
guess it did, because they kept on doing it. It was 
amazing. So, you know, what kind of people are you

35:45.798 --> 35:50.442
talking about?

35:52.844 --> 36:00.912
So, you know, did the people ever even, were they 
aware of... of what was going on in their country.

36:07.035 --> 36:09.738
People like that are not well-informed. They 
don't know politics.

36:14.183 --> 36:26.315
I'm sure they were aware that their whole country 
has been a war-torn country for as long as they can

36:14.183 --> 36:26.315
remember and generations back, but they don't 
know why. Probably didn't care. They don't care.

36:30.659 --> 36:37.225
If they had their fish and their rice for three 
meals a day or two meals a day, they'd be perfectly

36:30.659 --> 36:37.225
satisfied.

36:40.728 --> 36:46.413
So how about, how did you view them as a human being? 
Let's say, if you would have seen a dead gook laying

36:46.454 --> 36:58.945
there and also a dead American, did you make a 
distinction between, well, that's a dead person,

36:46.454 --> 36:58.945
American, And that's just a gook. What was the 
distinction? Did you look at him as a human being or

37:03.405 --> 37:06.508
not? Well,

37:07.269 --> 37:11.433
yes, I did. I think that anything that has two legs 
and stands upright and can carry on a

37:11.934 --> 37:27.430
conversation, no matter how deep that 
conversation can be as a human being, and it's a

37:11.934 --> 37:27.430
damn shame that things like that do go on in the 
world and the the really sad part about it is that

37:28.237 --> 37:54.835
it's no matter who tries how hard it's going to go in 
go on in the world until the end of time

37:28.237 --> 37:54.835
okay when you flew medevac what effect did, seeing 
all the death and destruction of

37:55.490 --> 38:04.962
US soldiers, what effect did that have on you? And 
how did you deal with it?

38:10.369 --> 38:18.240
Well, it

38:10.369 --> 38:18.240
has to have an effect on anyone, I'm sure. How much 
you let it affect you is another thing. I think I can

38:24.970 --> 38:52.564
consider myself as lucky as being one of the kind of 
people, I don't think I'm a hard person, really and

38:24.970 --> 38:52.564
truly I think I'm a pretty soft-hearted person, 
but

38:24.970 --> 38:52.564
something like that, I was fortunate enough to be 
able to somewhat disconnect myself from, and I

38:24.970 --> 38:52.564
think it He had a lot to do with my first flight in 
country, which I was relating to earlier. I wish

38:58.117 --> 39:16.115
I could remember the man's name that I flew with 
that day, but when we extracted the 16 KIAs from one

38:58.117 --> 39:16.115
LZ and all the wounded and everything. During 
which time, of course, the H-34 only has capacity

39:21.721 --> 39:27.408
of lifting about 12 fully laden combat troops. So 
we had to make a number of trips in to make this many

39:27.669 --> 39:36.981
extracts, or extract this many people. And during 
which time, we had to refuel. And so we went into

39:43.229 --> 39:48.876
Dong Ha to refuel. And we were sitting there 
refueling, and this pilot was sitting there, and

39:49.278 --> 40:02.937
he looked over at me and just started laughing, and 
he started cracking jokes. And I was puzzled by

40:02.957 --> 40:17.277
what he was doing, and later he told me that the only 
way that he could cope with what he was doing out

40:02.957 --> 40:17.277
there and seeing what he was seeing was to... 
lighten up and take his mind off of it and think

40:17.780 --> 40:46.032
about something else crack a joke or anything and I

40:17.780 --> 40:46.032
can't remember what his worries were that's a 
number of years ago but it hung with me and I think me

40:17.780 --> 40:46.032
being with him during that first date of first day 
of turmoil and tragedy that I saw prepared me for

40:47.176 --> 40:48.758
the rest of the year. And it let me shrug off some of 
this, detach myself from it, and not get

40:49.639 --> 41:01.191
personally involved. There was one fellow that I 
did go through. I went through OCS with him. I went

41:10.581 --> 41:12.583
through flight school with him. And when we went to 
Vietnam, we were assigned to different

41:12.603 --> 41:16.727
squadrons.

41:18.226 --> 41:21.329
He really let it get to him. And during his year over 
there, he probably lost about 40 pounds by

41:21.350 --> 41:27.036
worrying about it. And he lived through it. I don't 
know how he is now. I haven't seen him since then.

41:33.583 --> 41:37.848
But he was an absolute nervous wreck. There are 
many, many tales, as you see on TV every now and

41:39.029 --> 41:43.875
then. They bring up another tale about Vietnam and 
all this, personal interviews and the like. where

41:48.280 --> 42:12.354
so many people have let things get to them, and 
blaming society and thinking that the US

41:48.280 --> 42:12.354
government and the US people owe them a life and a 
well-being for the rest of their days, which I

41:48.280 --> 42:12.354
totally disagree with. A person goes over there to 
do a job, And like, I would have been drafted, but I

42:19.330 --> 42:25.676
did volunteer. And anyone that's in any service 
besides the Army is a volunteer. And a lot of the

42:32.242 --> 42:34.405
ones in the Army are volunteers. And

42:36.507 --> 42:47.397
you're there to defend your country no matter what 
the politicians

42:48.845 --> 42:50.967
how bad they screwed up, or whatever. You're there 
to defend your country, you're there to do the job

42:51.388 --> 43:04.702
for your country, and you're laying your life on 
the line for yourself, your country, your kids,

42:51.388 --> 43:04.702
your family in the future. But did you ever 
question why you were doing what you were doing?

43:09.547 --> 43:16.354
Why they were making you do this?

43:16.840 --> 43:25.317
I never have been much of a person to be involved in 
politics and not that it would matter anyway. It

43:26.099 --> 43:37.161
would probably just have pissed me off even more to 
where maybe I would have been more adamant

43:26.099 --> 43:37.161
about the situation.

43:39.149 --> 43:41.031
Maybe it was just the way I was raised. You do your 
stint for your country, and you do the best you can.

43:45.977 --> 43:53.747
And if you lose a part of your body doing it, then 
that's the way it happens. Luckily, I didn't lose

43:55.229 --> 43:56.731
anything. I had a couple of holes in me, but I didn't 
lose anything. And I don't feel like... the U.S.

44:08.765 --> 44:14.591
government or the American people or society as a 
whole owes me a thing. I did my job, and that was it.

44:21.178 --> 44:35.312
Like I say, maybe it's the way I was raised, brought 
up, thankful to my mother and father that I could

44:21.178 --> 44:35.312
detach myself from the horror and tragedy that was 
going on over there. And I'll also credit some to

44:35.765 --> 44:40.431
the pilot that I was with. Not having, you know, I 
didn't let it affect me mentally. Okay, why don't

44:48.622 --> 44:50.825
you describe when you were wounded? Okay, let's 
see. At the time, we were, the squadron was

44:54.650 --> 45:03.662
based aboard ship

45:05.701 --> 45:29.374
I don't remember if it was the Iwo Jima or the 
Princeton, but we were on a CMC mission into

45:05.701 --> 45:29.374
the northern area up around Da Nang and Khe Sanh 
area, I mean, pardon me, Dong Ha in the Khe Sanh

45:05.701 --> 45:29.374
area. And about halfway between Dong Ha and Khe 
Sanh, was an LZ, totally secure LZ, called Camp

45:35.232 --> 45:43.884
Carol. And it later changed its name, I don't 
remember what to. But we had been running the Rag

45:48.591 --> 45:53.377
Picker Express that day. Anybody that was being 
transferred from one unit to another or new people

45:54.338 --> 46:04.092
coming in or what have you, taken from maybe Quang 
Tri to Dong Han and then to Camp Carroll or Khe Sanh

46:04.325 --> 46:09.514
or whatever. And there had been a call that a recon 
patrol had come into Camp Carroll and they needed

46:10.256 --> 46:22.738
transportation back to Quang Tri. So we always 
flew in twos and

46:24.794 --> 46:46.121
I was helicopter commander at the time and we were 
flying the second helicopter so we weren't the

46:24.794 --> 46:46.121
point men and we were sitting in the LZ waiting to 
pick up this recon patrol. We had radio

46:47.703 --> 46:53.670
communication with the people on the ground and

46:58.207 --> 47:20.721
uh they were trying to locate this recon patrol 
that needed the transportation and we sat there i

46:58.207 --> 47:20.721
guess it seemed like forever but it was probably 
around 10 minutes

46:58.207 --> 47:20.721
they were trying to locate this recon patrol and 
couldn't find them couldn't find them and finally

46:58.207 --> 47:20.721
they found out that they had been picked up by 
someone else and already taken so we asked them if

47:21.207 --> 47:33.006
they needed anybody else or if anybody else there 
needed any transportation and they said well no
