00:08.755 --> 00:17.449
Well, I was born in 1929 in Germany, to be specific, 
in Königsberg, which was in Eastern Prussia,

00:08.755 --> 00:17.449
which was home. The parents, however, came from 
central and southern Germany. My father had been

00:24.140 --> 00:29.329
teaching economics, and of course, by being in 
university, you change. And during the period

00:30.592 --> 00:50.416
until the beginning of the war, World War II, he was 
on the assistant and associate professor level,

00:30.592 --> 00:50.416
so it was a well-to-do family, although the saying 
there was, being a professor, you either have a

00:30.592 --> 00:50.416
perambulator or you have a car, and so we had the 
perambulator. But it was, as I said, quite

00:50.656 --> 00:55.122
well-to-do middle class. When the war started, I 
was 10 years old, that was 1939, And six years

00:59.667 --> 01:20.781
later, in early 45, I'm sorry, in early 45, 945, we 
just got away one or two days ahead of the Soviet

00:59.667 --> 01:20.781
army and got out over the Baltic and ended up in the 
mountains of southeastern most Bavaria,

00:59.667 --> 01:20.781
opposite corner, sort of, of the empire. Well, 
after the war, I first worked for a year or so in a

01:21.554 --> 01:32.765
nursery, growing first cabbages and then later on 
advancing to fixing graves. But a year later, when

01:32.785 --> 01:49.080
my father had come back from prison camp and things 
settled down a little, I went back to school and

01:32.785 --> 01:49.080
received my high school degree, sort of high 
school degree, in 1947.

01:49.887 --> 02:00.520
in Europe, or most of Europe at least, central 
Europe at least, the high school degree

01:49.887 --> 02:00.520
corresponds to an education vaguely equivalent 
to a college sophomore year. So I was a little

02:00.680 --> 02:07.929
farther advanced than a high school graduate 
here. And I would also say that in those years

02:13.124 --> 02:19.558
because of the war that one was a little more mature 
than an ordinary 18 years old would be today. So the

02:20.740 --> 02:27.775
choice of what to do was not as bad or as unclear as it 
very often is nowadays. I had wavered between, I

02:28.750 --> 02:47.134
wanted to go to college, to university, which in 
those years, or in that country, was not as open in

02:28.750 --> 02:47.134
those years as it is now, but perhaps 10% or so, or 
not even 10%, the year class went to the

02:28.750 --> 02:47.134
university. At any rate, I wanted to proceed and 
had wavered for quite a while to go into economics

02:47.415 --> 02:57.508
because of my father's profession, and biology. 
and the biology came about by the influence of a

02:58.079 --> 03:08.921
childhood friend, where the high school had 
really no influence at all, because it was

02:58.079 --> 03:08.921
entirely language-oriented.

03:11.145 --> 03:19.682
So I decided to go into biology, and the 
professional goal was to become a high school

03:11.145 --> 03:19.682
teacher, on the continent is a very prestigious 
job. And as far as the training goes, the

03:23.519 --> 03:34.733
university career, one is being trained in the 
ordinary university department rather than as it

03:23.519 --> 03:34.733
is here put into a school of education. And 
therefore after having ended I could easily

03:35.935 --> 03:42.143
switch into the scientific career, which would be 
very difficult here. Because in those years the

03:43.642 --> 03:55.981
admissions were quite limited because many 
universities were being destroyed and of course

03:43.642 --> 03:55.981
all the people coming back from the war or those who 
did come back wanting to study. Therefore, as I

03:56.822 --> 04:07.118
said, the admission was limited and I had to sort of 
shop around who would take me, apply as graduate

03:56.822 --> 04:07.118
students do it now, apply at five or six different 
universities. And just to give you a feel,

04:07.098 --> 04:14.507
Göttingen, which was the top science university 
then, just laughed at me and said, well, it's your

04:07.098 --> 04:14.507
grades. I had a D in Latin and a good C in Greek, I 
think an A in English, and Bs or so in the sciences

04:15.848 --> 04:25.019
and in German. They just said no. And Göttingen had 
five Nobel Prize laureates, so they sort of could

04:26.501 --> 04:32.548
afford to beat me.

04:37.574 --> 04:48.305
I was accepted in Heidelberg and began then to 
study biology, which really meant to study botany

04:37.574 --> 04:48.305
as well as zoology, because that is just the way 
it's set up. And as minors, I had chosen chemistry

04:48.325 --> 04:53.951
and geography. The training was, again, in 
American standards, to be a little more... to

04:53.971 --> 05:02.940
explain a little more to the American listener how 
this... what my training had been. The training in

05:05.456 --> 05:16.812
biology was, or in sciences in general, was quite 
unquantitative in the physics, for example,

05:05.456 --> 05:16.812
which was introductory lecture for all 
scientists, the calculus was barely touched

05:17.146 --> 05:45.617
upon, and in the introductory chemistry, again, 
introductory for chemists as well as for people

05:17.146 --> 05:45.617
like me, and in biology, mathematics was 
practically not being used, which resulted in a

05:17.146 --> 05:45.617
fairly unquantitative training, overall 
training of biologists, and I believe that has not

05:17.146 --> 05:45.617
changed very much, and that is one of my principal 
weaknesses in hindsight.

05:46.036 --> 05:59.353
I studied biology, geography, and chemistry, and 
for a while was tempted to become a geographer

05:46.036 --> 05:59.353
because it just seemed very interesting, and I 
mentioned that because I still have geographical

05:46.036 --> 05:59.353
leanings. But the field was so overrun that I 
thought, well, it wouldn't lead anywhere. And, in

06:07.944 --> 06:11.529
effect, for these sort of fairly rational 
reasons, decided against it. And also there was

06:12.110 --> 06:13.832
another... more irrational reason was there was a 
Banzer or the same name geographer who had been a

06:14.200 --> 06:43.515
very nice party man and so whenever I went on 
excursions somebody politely asked are you

06:14.200 --> 06:43.515
perhaps related to Banzer or you are not related to 
Banzer I hope and so I thought no let's stick to

06:14.200 --> 06:43.515
biology

06:14.200 --> 06:43.515
now as I said it was 47 I think I said it was 1947 And 
most of the students were of advanced age by having

06:43.867 --> 06:51.357
just coming back from the war. The universities 
opened in 46 or 47 only. And very young students, me

06:55.021 --> 06:57.765
being 18, were admitted. So the atmosphere was 
really dominated by the war generation. And these

07:02.411 --> 07:09.500
people didn't fool around as normally one does in 
the universities in the first one or two years, but

07:02.411 --> 07:09.500
began to study right away. And, of course, we were 
carried along. This is important. Again, I may

07:15.251 --> 07:23.840
interject that in the old days, and it persists 
until now, I guess, on the continent, there were

07:15.251 --> 07:23.840
very few examinations. You entered, and it was 
only 10% of the year class, so if you entered, then

07:24.881 --> 07:31.067
usually you made it. That means you entered, if you 
had an adequate high school certificate, you had a

07:31.527 --> 07:37.393
reasonable expectation to finish. And in my case, 
for example, I entered in 47%. and had received the

07:42.676 --> 07:56.052
PhD in 55, there was no examination in the entire 
period excepting a few lab tests in chemistry,

07:42.676 --> 07:56.052
none examination whatsoever, which of course 
made fooling around relatively easy. But as I

07:58.115 --> 08:10.810
said, the atmosphere was not like that so that I was 
sort of automatically conditioned to study like

07:58.115 --> 08:10.810
the other people who knew exactly what they wanted 
and that they wanted to get out fast.

08:13.793 --> 08:32.397
Now, that there are no examination may sound a 
little strange, but there was some, the teachers

08:13.793 --> 08:32.397
could assess the students, because a very 
important tool of education there is, after the

08:13.793 --> 08:32.397
first one or two years, is to take seminars and give 
speeches. And these seminars mean that you

08:32.878 --> 08:36.923
disappear for a month or so in the library, not be 
seen. Just drop all lectures and do your seminar,

08:37.003 --> 08:42.450
prepare your seminar, which means, of course, 
independent study. And you stand and fall,

08:42.802 --> 08:45.607
really, on these seminars. In these seminars, the 
PhD candidates are being picked. In the others, I

08:51.597 --> 08:54.382
just go on for whatever.

09:03.137 --> 09:07.324
Yeah, I guess that is all about the undergraduate 
years. Yeah, there were, of course, money

09:08.452 --> 09:35.539
problems, no state support, and you had to have 
private support, but because the economy was

09:08.452 --> 09:35.539
pretty bad, fathers had died in the war or were 
unemployed, so many had to scrounge more than

09:08.452 --> 09:35.539
usually, and I, for example, had to work one summer 
in a mine, coal mine, just to make money, which

09:08.452 --> 09:35.539
didn't do any harm, but it was an interesting 
experience, obviously, to work at 2,000 feet

09:08.452 --> 09:35.539
below ground level. All right, that is the 
undergraduate time. Now, again, in Central

09:41.134 --> 09:49.644
Europe, I think it is quite common or almost 
expected from you that you change your university

09:41.134 --> 09:49.644
to just be exposed to different teachers. And in my 
case, I left Heidelberg in 1949 and chose to go to

09:50.785 --> 09:57.413
Kiel. The purpose of changing was to beef up my 
zoology because I thought I had gotten a good

10:00.612 --> 10:12.531
background in botany and geography had dropped, 
chemistry was sort of taken care of, so what was

10:00.612 --> 10:12.531
left was zoology. And there were only, in that 
time, only three universities which had

10:12.992 --> 10:18.461
worthwhile zoology. Three out of, I don't 
remember, 17 or so. And the two of the

10:23.309 --> 10:31.902
universities, well, one was Göttingen, which 
didn't like me anyway, and one was in southern

10:23.309 --> 10:31.902
Germany, and the other one, the third one, was 
Kiel. I wanted to go back to northern Germany, so

10:31.963 --> 10:35.268
that is how I got to Kiel. The timing, the choice of 
why in that semester was because the university

10:43.998 --> 10:49.586
authorities thought of introducing 
intermediate examinations to weed out people.

10:49.606 --> 10:58.719
And I thought it was so horrible in thought and 
infringement on everything academic freedom

10:49.606 --> 10:58.719
stood for that I thought they must get along 
without me. And so I went to Kiel. The first year

11:03.706 --> 11:09.494
there was largely to be devoted to invertebrates. 
And again, that is a little different from here,

11:09.934 --> 11:13.920
the situation here. in your major then you spent on 
the what is equivalent to the graduate level

11:14.153 --> 11:43.114
essentially all day six days a week in those years 
morning to night in the what you would call here the

11:14.153 --> 11:43.114
lab which is combined lab and the neuroscience and 
lecture and so on so the first year was to be devoted

11:14.153 --> 11:43.114
to invertebrates and the shareholder the 
principal teacher was remana who's name i've

11:43.904 --> 12:06.165
written down who is known in this country as being 
the inventor of benthic male fauna work but who has

11:43.904 --> 12:06.165
done very much more than that he was in great 
morphologist and comparative anatomy new

11:43.904 --> 12:06.165
ecology natural history ecology sort of and also 
was a very convincing teacher and human being, so

12:07.276 --> 12:18.128
that it was natural that you were carried along by 
him, and that it was natural that he determined the

12:07.276 --> 12:18.128
whole atmosphere in that place.

12:21.031 --> 12:36.388
And it would have been natural, really, to 
continue with him, but after a week or two, one late

12:21.031 --> 12:36.388
afternoon, two of my colleagues in that lab got up 
early and went away looking at their watches, and I

12:21.031 --> 12:36.388
asked, well, where are you going? And the answer 
was, well, we are going to a seminar in

12:37.077 --> 12:50.974
oceanography, in the Institute of Oceanography, 
or perhaps more properly called Institute of

12:37.077 --> 12:50.974
Oceanology, because it comprises all the 
branches of oceanography. And I sort of, being

12:52.876 --> 13:00.325
tired of drawing, making drawings of 
cross-sectional, where it was, I said, well, all

12:52.876 --> 13:00.325
right, may I come along? And they said, yes. that is 
interesting what I'm telling now is that I really

13:01.681 --> 13:30.287
got by accident into oceanography because until 
that afternoon I had never realized that this was a

13:01.681 --> 13:30.287
discipline of its own

13:01.681 --> 13:30.287
in spite of the geography training but well the 
ocean just wasn't there sort of now what it was was

13:01.681 --> 13:30.287
where we went to was their first seminar the 
opening afternoon they had been There had been an

13:30.740 --> 13:40.554
Institute of Oceanography before, before the 
war, but they had been bombed out and everybody was

13:30.740 --> 13:40.554
killed, man and mouse, as we say. The library went 
up in flames. And that semester, winter semester

13:43.397 --> 13:55.414
of 49 to 50, they had finally moved into permanent 
quarters, which was a converted large home,

13:43.397 --> 13:55.414
mansion-type home. And so now I had the 
possibility to have a lecture hall and offer a

13:55.934 --> 14:02.302
seminar, and so that was the occasion. So we went 
there and found five professors and, oh, I don't

14:02.342 --> 14:15.038
know, six, eight students sitting there, and then 
the three of us entering, so it was an unusual

14:02.342 --> 14:15.038
student-to-teacher ratio. And in front at the 
podium was Professor Wüst, or Wüst, as we say in

14:15.058 --> 14:22.988
Germany, who was its shareholder. which means the 
director of the institute and the one who had to

14:23.322 --> 14:26.346
stay. There were four other professors whom we 
would call here associate professors, but who in

14:26.746 --> 14:39.382
that hierarchical structure never could be 
promoted to full professor because the budget for

14:26.746 --> 14:39.382
the institute had one full professor. And as long 
as the full professor was there, the others were

14:39.402 --> 14:46.090
forced to remain associate professors, one for 
algae, one for zoology, and so on. And Wüst, as I

14:48.854 --> 15:05.244
implied or said, conducted the seminar, which, 
and said by means of introduction that this was in

14:48.854 --> 15:05.244
part an exercise for students and in part for 
mutual education, it would be run like a sort of

14:48.854 --> 15:05.244
journal club. And you, Ms. So-and-so, wouldn't 
you be interested in reviewing such and such? and

15:10.690 --> 15:36.175
so on, and of course picked the people he knew who 
were sort of accepted PhD candidates among these

15:10.690 --> 15:36.175
six or eight first, and then in the end there was 
still a pile, a big pile of books on the, or articles

15:10.690 --> 15:36.175
on the table, and so wouldn't you, I don't know your 
name, addressing me, be interested in reviewing

15:10.690 --> 15:36.175
this book, and I can't really read it, he said, But I 
have been assured it's interesting, and now what

15:36.627 --> 15:41.133
does a young student say? Yes, sir. And it turned 
out to be 200 pages in Swedish on the carbonate

15:43.957 --> 15:59.598
system in seawater, in the Baltic Sea, by Buch, who 
is an outstanding, one of the leading chemical

15:43.957 --> 15:59.598
oceanographers of those days, Buch in Finland. 
And I had two months. over the Christmas vacation

16:02.851 --> 16:22.410
two months' time to learn Swedish and learn the 
subject matter and then deliver, which I did, and

16:02.851 --> 16:22.410
fairly successfully, because from the sort of 
capital I had accumulated by that performance in

16:02.851 --> 16:22.410
front of all the professors, I lived then for the 
next two or three years. But it was a little

16:23.912 --> 16:31.980
difficult, because the new subject and then the 
Swedish language, which turned out to be much more

16:23.912 --> 16:31.980
difficult than I had thought.

16:36.213 --> 16:39.396
I thought it was difficult. Oh, no. No, no. I have 
transcribers who will understand it. Okay. All

16:43.200 --> 16:43.400
right. Well, and during these two months, I had to 
ask, of course, many questions and learn to meet

16:46.022 --> 16:53.470
these people. And as I said, because of the 
favorable student-to-professor ratio, which

16:54.391 --> 17:05.241
was very unusual for those days in these crowded 
universities, I just met living professors. and

17:05.508 --> 17:20.605
establish a personal relation to them, so that 
there was really a temptation right away to stay,

17:05.508 --> 17:20.605
especially with Kribe, who was the plantologist 
and also took care of the nutrient chemistry.

17:20.706 --> 17:22.227
There was no chemist proper. But then, on the other 
hand, Riemann had suggested already the subject

17:24.150 --> 17:31.498
for the PhD thesis to work on the head development 
of amphipodes. and for a year I sort of vacillated,

17:31.799 --> 17:35.546
didn't quite know what to do. Maintaining a seat in 
the zoology department, but already going out on

17:36.829 --> 17:52.879
cruises with these oceanographers and working 
upon urging by Krai on alkalinity, which was what

17:36.829 --> 17:52.879
his paper by Buch had been about, really.

17:55.593 --> 18:07.547
But a year later then, yeah, and I'm sorry, and 
Krai, what Krai wanted to have done is really in

17:55.593 --> 18:07.547
continuation of the work of his teacher, 
Wattenberg, who had been the chemist that killed,

17:55.593 --> 18:07.547
who had been killed, however, during the war. And 
Krai thought it was natural to continue. After

18:11.631 --> 18:18.759
all, I had mastered the literature, and so why 
shouldn't I continue, and so on and so forth. But a

18:18.779 --> 18:23.845
year later then, I decided, first of all, the 
geologist told me, now either you start seat or

18:25.833 --> 18:50.524
just place and I said well alright I'm becoming 
oceanographer but I also decided then within

18:25.833 --> 18:50.524
oceanography that I could not possibly that it 
would be very unwise to work on this alkalinity

18:25.833 --> 18:50.524
business because then as a thesis I would have 
probably been good thesis subject but I would be

18:25.833 --> 18:50.524
labeled as a chemist and I didn't have the chemist 
training so I said to Kai that would i would be happy

18:51.010 --> 19:10.555
to stay become your student but not with this 
subject which took him a while to understand but

18:51.010 --> 19:10.555
well what he then said is well uh i just received 
this book here which i have here which is by torson

18:51.010 --> 19:10.555
which came out in 46 and was the reproduction of 
reproduction and larval development of danish

19:10.957 --> 19:34.247
marine bottom invertebrates which is a sort of 
bible for many of us in those years because it

19:10.957 --> 19:34.247
opened a new field the larval the pelagic larvae of 
bottom invertebrates as a part of the life history

19:10.957 --> 19:34.247
of benthic animals and As you see, it's very thick, 
so it is in the Bible in the sense of that you should

19:34.919 --> 19:44.110
look very often in it, into it, and remind yourself 
of what's being said. And Christ said, well, why

19:45.232 --> 19:49.858
not do the same in Kielbein? And again, that had to 
do with earlier work by Wattenberg, his teacher

19:51.760 --> 19:58.328
whom I had mentioned. who had already worked on the 
issue of the transport of marine animals from the

19:58.797 --> 20:09.094
North Sea through the Danish waters, Danish 
Straits, into the Baltic. And the Baltic has very

20:09.293 --> 20:18.771
much lower salinity, so that many species don't 
intrude into the Baltic, but the keel bay is a sort

20:09.293 --> 20:18.771
of transition area. And what Kai suggested, a 
little naively, but in a sense it was right, was to

20:19.392 --> 20:31.555
study the factors which limit or delimit a 
distribution of the species.

20:36.479 --> 20:39.985
Now, I began to work on it through the literature. I 
had to still to take courses and went in 1951 to 1952

20:40.025 --> 20:46.035
to Sweden. And that had several reasons. One of it 
was that my father, who had to pay all these

20:48.680 --> 21:01.542
studies, said, well, I have now the money to allow 
you to go abroad, which is, of course, always a very

20:48.680 --> 21:01.542
good suggestion.

21:03.665 --> 21:17.267
I had realized that the library, anywhere in 
Germany, the library facilities would be too poor

21:03.665 --> 21:17.267
because of the losses in the war to work through the 
literature which Thorsten had used. So I tried to

21:17.287 --> 21:25.521
reread all the papers on larval development and 
sort them out in a different way. because Thorson

21:26.227 --> 21:34.722
had dedicated this book to Johann Petersen, who is 
the inventor of quantitative benthic research

21:26.227 --> 21:34.722
and who had been his teacher in Denmark. And 
Petersen had worked in the early part of the

21:34.742 --> 21:36.846
century. And the dedication was more than a token 
because, as I implied earlier, the book was really

21:37.888 --> 21:51.171
written or was concerned with the pelagic larva as 
a stage in the life history of a bottom animal. And

21:51.657 --> 22:02.352
my idea was to ask in the thesis, what can we learn by 
looking at the larvae as an pelagic animal? Never

22:02.432 --> 22:06.277
mind that it has to land on the bottom, but what does 
it do while it is in the plankton? That was the sort

22:06.297 --> 22:07.899
of core idea. And so I wanted to read the literature 
he had reviewed once more to see whether he had not

22:08.500 --> 22:14.608
omitted certain things. And of course, I wanted to 
be up on the most recent literature, the last half

22:19.163 --> 22:22.512
decade after the war. And so that is what I then 
connected with going to Sweden. So I studied in

22:27.265 --> 22:31.636
Lund at the University of Lund in southern Sweden 
first. Not really studied, but essentially

22:31.676 --> 22:34.624
worked at the library. and during the summer of 52 
then went to the Swedish Skagrak coast which has

22:35.009 --> 22:44.401
very much higher salinity than Kiel Bay to see the 
larvae actually. Of course I had other ideas in my

22:45.442 --> 22:54.854
mind too but in hindsight this is what I learned to 
see the living animals before I started to study

22:45.442 --> 22:54.854
them in Kiel Bay.

22:57.897 --> 23:02.383
The Thorson Bible is about all bottom 
invertebrates but It seemed obvious that I

23:03.241 --> 23:05.806
couldn't treat all of them. I had to specialize in 
one or two groups, two of them being very, very good

23:05.826 --> 23:18.027
and also having helpers, but I thought, well, and 
everybody advised, well, you can't work as

23:05.826 --> 23:18.027
comprehensively if you ever want to finish in a 
reasonable time. And I had asked Thorsen, what

23:18.884 --> 23:24.990
would you suggest, which group should I pick? And 
Thorsen had immediately said, well, obviously

23:25.110 --> 23:33.278
the mollusks and perhaps the bivalves, because 
they are least known, and there you easily can find

23:25.110 --> 23:33.278
new things.

23:36.201 --> 23:47.912
But I thought, well, I'm not interested in 
describing new larvae, but I would like to know

23:36.201 --> 23:47.912
what larvae do, never mind what they belong to. 
decided that I rather should settle on that group

23:48.263 --> 24:12.583
which is best known so that I do not have to worry 
about identification that I just identifying I

23:48.263 --> 24:12.583
would just go to the keys and begin counting in 
order to make statements about the ecology so I

23:48.263 --> 24:12.583
picked echinoderms on that account which at that 
time were the best known by about larvae with hard

23:48.263 --> 24:12.583
parts easy to identify and so on But then I realized 
also that there are very few echinoderms living in

24:13.002 --> 24:19.188
the Bay of Keel because of the low salinity. Most of 
them drop out earlier. And so I had to pick another

24:21.610 --> 24:23.612
group. And the choice was then polychaetes. And 
that was sort of half rational, half irrational.

24:30.699 --> 24:34.763
The rational part was, yes, I needed another 
group, reasonably well known. And the sort of, not

24:36.084 --> 24:41.389
irrational is too much, but The other part of my 
thinking was that the zoologist among these

24:41.572 --> 25:04.744
professors I had mentioned in the oceanography 
department, Friedrich, as we say, who later went

24:41.572 --> 25:04.744
to Bremerhaven and wrote a textbook there, many 
people still use, he was an ecologist and

24:41.572 --> 25:04.744
physiologist, but his taxonomic specialty had 
been polychaetes. polychaetes are very

25:05.433 --> 25:14.806
important on the seabed, half of the species also 
are polychaetes, and I thought, well, if

25:05.433 --> 25:14.806
Friedrich leaves, well, somebody has to identify 
polychaetes, and so I chose polychaetes. And that

25:15.627 --> 25:22.937
sounds now a little more cunning than I actually 
was, but I thought it was an empty niche, and why

25:15.627 --> 25:22.937
shouldn't I occupy it, sort of? And that is then 
what I studied on the Swedish Skagrak coast, and in

25:24.639 --> 25:33.111
the library, the echinoderm and polychaete 
larvae.

25:37.225 --> 26:00.583
And while in Lund, thinking about it, how to do it, 
what to do, when coming back, what courses to make,

25:37.225 --> 26:00.583
the sort of revelation, if I may put it this way, it 
really came one night, laying in bed, out of the

25:37.225 --> 26:00.583
blue, how to sample was to forget about the nets, as 
all people had worked before on plankton, with

25:37.225 --> 26:00.583
nets, but to use a plankton pump. That is the key of 
the success, that I settled on a tool which allows

26:01.357 --> 26:22.326
you to lower the hose into one spot at depth and take 
out so much water as you need, which means that, in

26:01.357 --> 26:22.326
contrast to a net which you tow over a certain 
distance and you never quite know where you were

26:01.357 --> 26:22.326
and what the salinity was and so on. So the fact that 
I showed the sampling tool, which not only where I

26:30.432 --> 26:43.769
was not only sure how much water was sampled, but I 
also was sure where the sample had been taken from,

26:30.432 --> 26:43.769
which allowed me also to take phytoplankton 
samples and salinity samples and, in other words,

26:30.432 --> 26:43.769
to describe the environment. That, in hindsight, 
turned out to be the key to the success. I did all the

26:49.636 --> 26:52.980
collection in 1953. And during that time, I 
increased the number of stations ever worked on

26:54.597 --> 27:02.699
with the pump by an order of magnitude. There had 
been four stations by Torsen and two or three

27:02.719 --> 27:09.197
elsewhere, but I had 10 times as many, which of 
course helped. and defended the thesis in 1955.

27:13.847 --> 27:17.412
Let me just say one more thing about the pump series 
by Thorsen. Thorsen had used a pump, a hand-driven

27:17.912 --> 27:35.515
pump, as you use in a farmer's yard, which is in a 
very laborious way, three or four times during his

27:17.912 --> 27:35.515
studies, and had given the original data, and 
while looking at the data, I thought that the

27:17.912 --> 27:35.515
interpretation he gave to that must- can't 
possibly be right. And In a way, the thesis starts

27:37.730 --> 27:47.180
out from, or the whole approach started out from 
looking at these curves and saying Torsten's

27:37.730 --> 27:47.180
interpretation can't be right. And in a way, also 
later, I have, many of my papers are really built on

27:48.742 --> 28:01.155
mistakes by others that I, rather than starting 
out from scratch, that I just read the literature

27:48.742 --> 28:01.155
and thought, well, that doesn't sound right. 
doesn't hold water and shouldn't I check it and

28:01.608 --> 28:28.054
well as I said many of my papers are based on the 
mistakes of others which however I think many

28:01.608 --> 28:28.054
other people do few have an idea completely out of 
the blue but they start out from somewhere and well

28:01.608 --> 28:28.054
I started out from the mistakes of others so

28:01.608 --> 28:28.054
that was then the thesis where I counted about 
1,000 samples or so just to give you a feel for the

28:28.372 --> 28:30.999
magnitude of the effort. It really was sitting on 
the microscope and not worrying about girls or

28:31.059 --> 28:35.591
things, but really work. But concurrently still 
thinking of, or really being urged by cry, All

28:45.719 --> 29:07.060
right, go for the PhD, but I don't know of any 
position, so don't gamble on now that you will

28:45.719 --> 29:07.060
become an oceanographer, but continue with your 
teacher's training, take that botany course,

28:45.719 --> 29:07.060
which was utterly boring, and do this and do that in 
order to have all right the PhD, but have a living

28:45.719 --> 29:07.060
income by becoming a high school teacher.

29:12.005 --> 29:13.667
Because at that time, the German education, the 
German universities were still sort of limping

29:15.284 --> 29:24.900
along because there was not just enough money 
around. And before the war, they had been the same

29:24.920 --> 29:33.013
way, and Christ sort of remembered that, how 
difficult it was to make a living as a scientist.

29:33.033 --> 29:37.360
And it was reasonable to suggest, well, play it 
safe.

29:40.394 --> 29:56.709
In addition to this counting and then this going to 
boring courses, I wrote already some papers on

29:40.394 --> 29:56.709
larvae development of polychaetes because I did 
run into new larvae and it was obvious to describe

29:40.394 --> 29:56.709
this separately rather than put them into the big 
thesis. And of course also by necessity I became

29:57.790 --> 30:04.456
acquainted with the taxonomy of the adults so that 
I could identify polychaetes. And this is an

30:04.797 --> 30:07.279
important point which will come up later.
