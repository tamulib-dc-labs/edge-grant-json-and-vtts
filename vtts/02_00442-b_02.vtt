WEBVTT

00:01.567 --> 00:05.090
I thought it was mighty good. I thought

00:05.110 --> 00:28.772
the required subjects in English, mathematics, 
chemistry,

00:05.110 --> 00:28.772
biology, those made a very good foundation

00:05.110 --> 00:28.772
to build on with more applied subjects.

00:31.267 --> 00:39.117
I never was too favorable to the requirements in 
history and government.

00:39.137 --> 00:41.499
That's one of my favorite requirements. Yeah, of 
course. There was a gentleman by the name of Paul

00:43.482 --> 00:53.694
Pearson who taught nutrition in the animal 
science department who was really the primary one

00:43.482 --> 00:53.694
and inspired me to take graduate work.

00:57.058 --> 00:58.540
And as a junior, and I did pretty well in his 
nutrition course. He had me take an additional

01:02.039 --> 01:10.036
course in organic chemistry to prepare for 
graduate work.

01:15.527 --> 01:16.950
Paul Pearson very strangely is still operating in 
the nutrition field today. He must be

01:22.534 --> 01:29.649
mid-seventies or so, but he's associated with the 
faculty at his medical college at the University

01:22.534 --> 01:29.649
of Arizona. He's the leader in nutrition around. 
He left the nutrition section in the Animal

01:39.290 --> 01:40.972
Science Department. He was the first dean of the 
Graduate College at Texas A&M, so he was that

01:40.992 --> 01:46.119
caliber guy. So I was just very fortunate in being 
exposed to really high caliber people as an

01:46.139 --> 01:56.753
undergraduate student.

01:56.773 --> 02:05.905
Fred Bryson, who's died last year after he was 
recognized and received that Distinguished

01:56.773 --> 02:05.905
Alumni Award. just an outstanding person, taught 
horticulture at that time. I later was associated

02:13.834 --> 02:18.780
with him in the A&M Methodist Church for many, 
many, many years.

02:22.385 --> 02:29.795
So I was just so fortunate to be exposed to really 
high caliber, well qualified teachers. Why did

02:29.815 --> 02:33.900
these fine people, why do you think that they took 
an interest in you?

02:37.171 --> 02:39.373
I think they were interested in all of their 
students. I don't say that they were showing

02:40.974 --> 02:47.280
favoritism toward me.

02:49.442 --> 02:51.724
I did have a good academic record along. I think 
that's the same thing's true today. The ones that

02:55.627 --> 03:06.537
perform well in any course will receive a little 
increased attention and encouragement from

02:55.627 --> 03:06.537
instructors.

03:11.326 --> 03:13.508
Can you tell me about your student colleagues? You 
learn quite a bit in the Corps. Did you learn from

03:17.352 --> 03:20.995
them in the classroom? Well of course.

03:27.221 --> 03:31.245
I just got through talking to one of them a few 
minutes ago. It was a high administration of Iowa

03:31.265 --> 03:38.532
beef processors by the name of Charlie Jennings. I 
remember going through class with him. Ed Brown

03:43.207 --> 03:48.595
still see a good many of the classmates that I went 
to school with. They have performed mighty well as

03:48.615 --> 03:57.507
a general rule.

03:57.528 --> 04:06.460
Certainly we were stimulated by the association 
of the people in the classroom and the

03:57.528 --> 04:06.460
laboratories.

04:10.608 --> 04:14.392
We live together a lot closer than the students do 
today.

04:17.995 --> 04:26.664
I would say that we have developed a little closer 
comradeship than is the usual situation as we go

04:17.995 --> 04:26.664
through school. We were on campus most weekends. 
We were interacting a whole lot more. Smaller

04:33.130 --> 04:34.191
student body. Sure. Another question about the 
core. We were talking before, this is one I forgot

04:40.898 --> 04:53.581
to ask you, we were talking before about the 
opinion of graduates of other ROTC and West Point

04:40.898 --> 04:53.581
of Texas A&M Corps officers. In what way do you 
think being a member of the Corps helped your

04:54.242 --> 05:03.919
career, and in what way did it hinder your career, 
if there are any ways?

05:07.139 --> 05:08.982
Well, I can dispose of that first. I don't know any 
way being a member of the Cadet Corps of Texas A&M

05:09.002 --> 05:15.792
ever would have hindered me in any way. Okay.

05:19.938 --> 05:30.874
I think it helped because

05:19.938 --> 05:30.874
Texas A&M had such a fine reputation with the 
military, which I think it enjoys today. I think it

05:30.894 --> 05:33.838
still has that kind of a reputation.

05:37.160 --> 05:39.563
Well, that was no excuse. I mean, no substitute for 
performance, but it sure did give you a leg up. Sure

05:44.030 --> 05:44.570
did. Being a graduate from ROTC at Texas A&M, you 
were presumed to be effective as an Army officer

05:44.590 --> 05:52.882
right off the bat.

06:01.935 --> 06:04.939
Were there other reasons beside the fact that you 
enjoyed the 10 acres at your home and had animals

06:05.645 --> 06:11.792
when you were a child. Were there other reasons 
beside that that you decided to go into

06:12.613 --> 06:18.680
agriculture when you got here? Well as I told you, I 
was enrolled in agricultural engineering. Yeah,

06:24.206 --> 06:25.728
when you first came here. And I'd always enjoyed 
livestock so much. Of course I wasn't employed for

06:32.290 --> 06:34.573
pay. But I spent most of my time around the cattle 
barn in Texas A&M working for free. I

06:42.504 --> 06:47.151
believe in that. If a person wants a job, he can show 
somebody what he can do. If a job comes up, he can get

06:51.878 --> 06:53.640
it. So actually I didn't get one there. I got one on 
the janitor's horse. So even though I was

07:03.290 --> 07:12.021
registered in agricultural engineering and had 
an entirely satisfactory academic record in

07:03.290 --> 07:12.021
engineering my first semester. I transferred 
over the second semester because obviously

07:12.362 --> 07:17.509
that's where my major interest was. I

07:17.529 --> 07:32.368
was, as I say, stimulated by my vocational 
agriculture instructor in high school. by the

07:33.935 --> 07:42.404
county agent for whom I worked one summer, and 
measuring crop acreages around.

07:46.629 --> 07:50.193
I just enjoy watching things grow, particularly 
livestock. From the time I was a little bit kid, I

07:51.374 --> 07:59.583
was fascinated with livestock, particularly 
cattle. I've had the pleasure of interviewing a

08:00.064 --> 08:03.267
number of associated with the College of 
Veterinary Medicine here, and it sounds like they

08:03.736 --> 08:17.630
had similar experiences in their youth as you have 
had, and similar interests in livestock and in

08:03.736 --> 08:17.630
animals that you had. Why did you, did you ever 
consider going into veterinary medicine?

08:24.437 --> 08:27.040
No, I really didn't. My closest friend from Orange 
was a year ahead of me and was in veterinary

08:32.187 --> 08:38.877
medicine.

08:38.897 --> 08:40.460
His name was Herschel Darman. Darman? Darman, 
D-O-R-M-A, and still is a veterinary

08:43.044 --> 08:48.872
practitioner at Fort Worth. I don't know why I 
suppose, you know, my first

09:00.385 --> 09:04.931
major with agricultural engineering, so that was 
way off the track. Right. You know, then I got it.

09:08.235 --> 09:13.361
Herschel Darman, my good friend, worked at the 
Beef Kettle Center, and I used to help him. Got

09:15.264 --> 09:29.582
acquainted with the people around there, and 
acquainted with the professors in the Animal

09:15.264 --> 09:29.582
Science Department in that way, so I would say, no, 
I didn't ever consider veterinary medicine,

09:15.264 --> 09:29.582
though. I've always had a respect for veterinary 
medicine. Herschel Darman asked me to come with

09:35.362 --> 09:44.293
him to anatomy lectures sometime to hear Dr. Mark 
Francis lecture. I did that a few times. Did you

09:45.935 --> 09:46.696
really? Oh yeah. What did you think of Dr. Francis? 
Oh what a great gentleman. Of course by that time he

09:52.463 --> 09:55.367
was deaf.

09:58.368 --> 10:04.357
He had certain eccentricities, but he was devoted 
to students at Texas A&M.

10:08.843 --> 10:17.355
He was an outstanding person and an outstanding 
lecturer and certainly had the respect of his

10:08.843 --> 10:17.355
students. And I got acquainted during that time 
with Dr. Marsh Diller, first dean of Under

10:18.145 --> 10:23.971
Medicine. I cleaned up his office in this 
building. He was in this building, you see. All the

10:28.255 --> 10:34.541
deans, the four deans were in this building, so I 
got acquainted with him. What type of a man was he?

10:38.465 --> 10:41.668
He was a little bit courtly and a little bit clumsy. 
That way, a good scholar. His wife showed American

10:46.445 --> 10:53.455
Saddle Horses, so I got acquainted with her 
through that means. Owen Garrigan at the Staples,

10:54.156 --> 10:59.985
we used to have horse shows in the Pavilion. Dr. 
Leonard over in the Charter Deau Veterinary

11:00.005 --> 11:09.158
Laboratories, that is a clinic. I got acquainted 
with him, had a lot of respect for him. We had, let's

11:15.031 --> 11:20.378
see, Dr. Pat Burns, who's still around right now. 
He taught me veterinary physiology. Oh, really?

11:25.544 --> 11:34.356
And you know, I thought it was really something 
when he expected us to know the names of all the 207

11:25.544 --> 11:34.356
bones and body, whatever it was, I guess. But you 
know, I did it, whatever it is. Fine, fine teacher.

11:41.660 --> 11:45.086
Dr. Leonard taught us veterinary. We had a course 
for animal scientists in veterinary medicine. He

11:52.740 --> 11:58.490
lectured that way, so I know that I still have a fine 
respect for veterinarians.

12:02.517 --> 12:06.604
I'm sure that a lot of that was developed during the 
time I was a student. primarily because I got

12:08.474 --> 12:20.869
associated with them because of my real good 
friend, Herschel Darman, who was taking winter

12:08.474 --> 12:20.869
medicine.

12:20.889 --> 12:23.493
What were your plans when you graduated in 1939?

12:26.136 --> 12:31.022
Well, I sure, first plan was to try to get something 
to get that job. A lot of people that graduated in

12:31.382 --> 12:35.848
those days couldn't find employment. A.K. Mackey 
was associated with the dining hall and

12:38.546 --> 12:50.908
purchasing the meat for them.

12:51.148 --> 12:57.820
After I had a course under him and he got me involved 
with his research a bit with Sylvia He also got me

12:59.200 --> 13:09.793
acquainted with his extra job of purchasing, 
providing, consulting with the dining hall on

12:59.200 --> 13:09.793
purchasing meat. But during my senior year, I got 
acquainted with Cliff Holtard, Jay Penniston,

13:09.813 --> 13:17.322
through A.K. Mikey. Of course, I wound up then that 
I got my brother acquainted with him too, and they

13:20.306 --> 13:27.655
hired both of us on graduation. Actually, I 
started working for the Dining Hall Department

13:28.242 --> 13:36.396
a month or two before I graduated. Went right into 
that position.

13:41.706 --> 13:50.942
My responsibility was working with Mr. Mikey and 
making the decisions on meat purchases and

13:41.706 --> 13:50.942
advising Cliff O'Tart about that. So I was the 
first dining hall steward of Duncan Dining Hall on

13:52.441 --> 14:02.770
this campus, which was brand new in the fall of 
1939. And my brother then got acquainted through

14:02.790 --> 14:08.195
my early association. He took a position with the 
dining hall department. He was dining hall

14:13.600 --> 14:16.603
steward of Sabiza Dining Hall. So that's what both 
of us did when we graduated. We moved right into

14:19.005 --> 14:21.267
that position. Those were good jobs in those days. 
They had $125 a month in room and board. No kidding.

14:30.476 --> 14:36.962
So we were provided quarters over near Hotard 
Hall. Hotard Hall was brand new a little later and

14:36.982 --> 14:42.388
he and I both lived in Hotard Hall too as bachelors. 
A little later we had some wooden quarters right

14:43.949 --> 14:50.916
behind the old board of directors' quarters here 
in those days. Those were real good jobs. Even

14:56.501 --> 15:01.286
though you had been a regimental commander, then 
you didn't look forward to a military career? What

15:03.128 --> 15:04.910
were your feelings on a military career? Well, I 
had that opportunity. They kept in garrison while

15:10.336 --> 15:18.726
they were OTC instructors.

15:19.702 --> 15:27.273
nominated me or the instructors had for 
distinguished military graduate. I believe

15:27.293 --> 15:30.537
there were nine in those days. They were pretty 
selective. There were nine distinguished

15:32.179 --> 15:38.428
military graduates.

15:38.448 --> 15:39.730
I was one of them. He talked to me about going into 
the services.

15:48.623 --> 15:48.983
I did consider that opportunity.

15:53.490 --> 16:09.409
I think I was too close to family, just too 
provincial Texan to want to get into a big

15:53.490 --> 16:09.409
adventure of getting in the Army and being 
stationed in some foreign country like Oklahoma.

16:09.749 --> 16:16.097
Or

16:09.749 --> 16:16.097
getting all around the world. I think that's what 
was

16:20.384 --> 16:23.331
made me a holding all, something like that. I 
couldn't see being separated from my family that

16:23.351 --> 16:26.218
much. You were only 20 at this time? That's right. 
Of course I couldn't be commissioned when I

16:31.610 --> 16:34.317
graduated. In those days you couldn't get a 
commission until you were 21, so I wasn't

16:40.263 --> 16:45.132
commissioned at ROTC, couldn't get my 
commission. I had to apply after my birthday,

16:45.212 --> 16:52.685
September the 29th of 1939, and I actually 
received my commission in December. Because you

16:54.929 --> 16:57.934
had to be 21 years old to get a commission.

17:00.496 --> 17:09.488
Some of my classmates did Darcy McCrory, for 
instance, right here, who's right around Brian,

17:00.496 --> 17:09.488
was a distinguished military graduate. He went 
right in the armed forces. He retired as a colonel,

17:12.793 --> 17:18.120
came back here and started working. It's kind of 
interesting that one of the first people that my

17:18.140 --> 17:25.170
father and I talked to when we came to Texas A&M 
looking for student employment was a man named

17:25.842 --> 17:34.813
Arvin Simpson.

17:34.833 --> 17:39.118
Who of course became a Lieutenant General in the 
Marine Corps. Back here he had been for five or six

17:39.138 --> 17:41.441
years.

17:44.104 --> 17:45.045
So anyhow. What impact did Simpson have on you? Did 
you know him very well? Not about any, no. That's,

17:50.432 --> 17:53.115
he was, he was a fairly recent graduate then and 
around working in the position. Lucian Morgan

18:02.453 --> 18:05.237
also had gone into insurance. Sid Loveless was in 
the insurance business. He sold me an insurance

18:09.583 --> 18:12.086
policy at that time. He was an outstanding ROTC 
cadet devoted to the cavalry. Now he and I share a

18:19.135 --> 18:21.718
grandchildren.

18:23.622 --> 18:25.285
My daughter's married to his son. In other words, 
when you graduated in 1939, you didn't look

18:26.467 --> 18:32.918
forward to a military career. You made a choice at 
that time. That's right, and I certainly, I was

18:34.842 --> 18:46.662
interested in a career in Meach at that time, 
because I was so fascinated with what I'd done with

18:34.842 --> 18:46.662
A.K. Mikey and Sylvia Colbert. Inspired by that 
and my opportunity to work with people at Swifton

18:49.390 --> 19:05.728
Company and Armoring Company in Fort Worth and 
other packers, Houston Packing Company.

19:05.748 --> 19:14.558
My intention was, I was very pleased with the 
opportunity I had to work in the food business in

19:05.748 --> 19:14.558
the dining halls. Cliff Holtard, was an 
outstanding man managing the dining halls. The

19:23.529 --> 19:33.221
chefs we had in both Duncan and Savisa Dining Hall 
were real top people in the food business. I was

19:33.241 --> 19:36.125
satisfied, that looked like a good career to me. 
And I lived at Texas A&M, so you know, I'll go get a

19:36.625 --> 19:40.950
job right here. That's right. Now when you 
graduated, I know that one of your goals of course

19:43.424 --> 19:49.130
was to get a job like you just said. Did you have 
other definite goals or were you at the age of 20 not

19:49.170 --> 19:59.961
very sure about what you wanted to do in the future? 
I certainly wasn't very sure. The first thing that

20:03.105 --> 20:07.509
was essential for me to do was earn a living. I had 
sort of suppressed the desire to take graduate

20:12.702 --> 20:16.026
work. I couldn't see how that could be funded. So 
after Paul Pearson inspired me to take organic

20:18.088 --> 20:30.783
chemistry to prepare for graduate work, I took the 
first semester of it. It was a real demanding

20:32.445 --> 20:35.569
course. Only half the class passed it. I was in that 
course with the chemical engineers and others,

20:39.466 --> 20:46.821
classical organic chemistry.

20:49.707 --> 20:52.793
I think I made a C in it, I remember for sure. Anyhow, 
that worked me harder than I wanted to work, so I

20:53.034 --> 20:59.888
didn't take the second semester of it. But I 
appreciated the fact that it is very demanding.

21:04.087 --> 21:12.542
When I came back and started graduate work in 1947, 
I took the second semester of it then, and I

21:04.087 --> 21:12.542
couldn't remember enough of the first semester of 
A&R. So I lost my ambition to any I might have ever

21:13.885 --> 21:24.103
had to do graduate work, because I just couldn't 
see any financial way of doing it until I

21:13.885 --> 21:24.103
graduated.

21:28.555 --> 21:32.980
Of course, the entry in the armed services was 
entirely accidental. During that time, we had

21:33.560 --> 21:38.085
what was called the Thomason Act. And as the armed 
forces started expanding in the late 30s, every

21:38.105 --> 21:54.242
reserve officer was obliged to serve one year in 
the armed forces. And as they started expanding,

21:56.264 --> 22:04.573
they started some, they started the consolidated 
masses. They didn't have any large mess halls

22:04.593 --> 22:08.977
anywhere in the armed forces then. And the newest 
one in the country was Duncan Dining Hall on this

22:08.997 --> 22:14.763
campus. And it was a real well done facility. Much 
stainless steel, latest design, a fine food

22:18.107 --> 22:23.112
facility. One of the best in the country at that 
time, of that nature. So we had a good many visitors

22:26.740 --> 22:39.312
from the armed forces when they were going into 
consolidated messes around at airfields and some

22:26.740 --> 22:39.312
of the army bases were expanding at that time. One 
of them was the Commandant of the School for Bakers

22:41.514 --> 22:53.165
and Cooks for the Eighth Corps at Fort Sam Houston, 
Texas. His name was Wayne M. Pickles.

22:57.655 --> 23:07.326
When I was showing him around the Duncan 
Nightingale and all, he learned that I had an ROTC

22:57.655 --> 23:07.326
commission.

23:07.346 --> 23:22.482
And propositioned me, as he was expanding his 
operations, to come in to work with him

23:07.346 --> 23:22.482
at Fort Sam Houston, the school for bakers and 
cooks. In what capacity? As assistant

23:24.964 --> 23:26.746
commandant. Really? So I was called in August the 
4th, 1941 to serve a year under the Thomason Act as

23:27.367 --> 23:41.668
assistant commandant of the school for breakers 
and cooks at Fort Sam Houston. So while my branch As

23:43.110 --> 23:45.674
a lieutenant? As a second lieutenant, while my 
branch was artillery, I was called in at the

23:45.694 --> 23:52.384
quartermaster corps.

23:55.874 --> 23:57.036
and functioned. I taught the meats work and 
carried out some administrative duties with the

23:57.476 --> 24:08.773
school for bakers and cooks at Fort Sam Houston, 
Texas. So you took official leave then from A&M?

24:11.316 --> 24:17.525
Took official leave, one year official

24:11.316 --> 24:17.525
leave. Then after Pearl Harbor

24:21.946 --> 24:25.811
Shortly after that, you know, I couldn't quite 
stand it. I was shirking my training, I felt like,

24:25.911 --> 24:36.945
so I put in for transfer

24:25.911 --> 24:36.945
to my basic ranch. And I was transferred about 200 
yards there from the headquarters of the school

24:38.207 --> 24:48.780
for bakers and cooks to the old outfit of the second 
division right there in San Antonio. They had

24:49.402 --> 24:51.425
worked with me in ROTC's. I must have had one of the 
shortest distance track for them. What did you do

24:57.974 --> 25:00.077
as far as bakers and cooks? You trained enlisted 
men or officers? We did have officer, we did have

25:03.282 --> 25:10.853
mess officer courses, they were shorter, but we 
trained bakers and cooks. So it was, I don't

25:11.525 --> 25:15.108
remember the length of the course. Seemed to be 
like a nine month course early. You know, as things

25:17.771 --> 25:27.460
heated up, it was contracted and concentrated and 
intensified, but early. When I first got in the

25:28.661 --> 25:32.544
Army, my shots, you know, things were pretty 
leisurely. We had Wednesday afternoons off,

25:32.564 --> 25:40.992
weekends, so it was a pretty leisurely sort of 
thing those days. Wasn't anybody in any hurry.

25:46.491 --> 25:48.573
Nine-month course for Feckerson Cooks. Where 
were you in December 7, 1941? I was right here at

25:52.197 --> 25:57.062
College Station.

25:59.384 --> 26:04.930
I started courting Jane Gray, who worked for the 
dining hall department as a secretary.

26:08.874 --> 26:10.776
She lived right here on campus.

26:14.114 --> 26:19.382
And I believe December 7th was Sunday.

26:22.147 --> 26:24.010
I was enjoying playing golf. I was over here for the 
weekend. I played golf. And when I heard about it, I

26:28.356 --> 26:31.742
was driving back to San Antonio. I heard about it on 
the automobile radio on the way back to San

26:31.782 --> 26:36.409
Antonio.

26:39.005 --> 26:44.731
I decided right then that I would put in for 
transfer back to my basic branch for artillery.

26:50.577 --> 26:53.280
Had you been following the news or were you pretty 
shocked? Oh I was very very shocked, certainly.

26:56.183 --> 26:57.724
I'd been following the news. Of course I knew it was 
developments in Europe and threats around the

26:57.744 --> 27:04.031
world. I sure didn't expect anything like that 
from the Japanese. Very few others to talk about.

27:11.196 --> 27:13.860
That's absolutely for sure. Now next time, we're 
going to talk about your military career in Dell.

27:23.875 --> 27:27.821
Do you have other appointments right now? No. I'd 
like to ask you just two last questions for this

27:29.022 --> 27:36.754
session about Texas A&M before we leave your 
student years. How many former students that I've

27:37.747 --> 27:42.454
talked to feel that there's something special 
about A&M? I always get this, that it's more than an

27:43.295 --> 27:48.021
institution of higher learning. Do you have that 
feeling, and if you do, could you describe it?

27:53.649 --> 27:57.915
Certainly, I think it is more than an institution 
of higher learning.

28:00.376 --> 28:11.974
I don't think it is quite as much now with more than 
30,000 students as it was when

28:00.376 --> 28:11.974
I came here. It was one big fraternity. The 
students considered it that and resisted any

28:16.341 --> 28:27.919
offshoots of fraternities at all. there was a 
strong military tradition. I

28:33.836 --> 28:49.396
think it was a fraternity of brotherhood, that's 
what it was, the whole outfit. And if you, followed

28:52.621 --> 29:02.637
along, accepted the traditions, accepted the 
hazing, the relationships of freshman and

28:52.621 --> 29:02.637
upperclassmen, and all of that. You earned a 
position. You earned a place in the fraternity.

29:07.686 --> 29:12.394
Even to get in a student club like the Silent 
Sirloin Club, you had to make sacrifices. You

29:13.595 --> 29:17.582
weren't even eligible until you got to be a junior 
as a major. Then there was an initiation rite with

29:18.592 --> 29:23.139
hazing involved in it. You had to make sacrifices 
to belong, so you respected the membership a whole

29:23.159 --> 29:35.859
lot more than getting it now, where all you gotta do 
is pay three dollars or something. You had to be an

29:35.939 --> 29:39.083
animal science major. It was something to lead to 
something special. Well, Texas A&M is something

29:41.167 --> 29:42.709
special.

29:47.110 --> 29:57.103
It was just the experiences and the sacrifices 
made just created a special bond among the

29:47.110 --> 29:57.103
students. This camaraderie you were talking 
about. That's right, and the faculty too.

30:00.708 --> 30:09.180
Remember in those days, when I came here, there 
were I don't know how many houses on campus. D.W.

30:09.300 --> 30:10.762
Williams and A.K. Mackey lived in houses right on 
the campus.

30:16.928 --> 30:24.557
So the faculty people were associated with the 
students to a much greater degree, not only in the

30:16.928 --> 30:24.557
classroom but outside the classroom. You lived 
together more. There just weren't all the

30:27.640 --> 30:31.445
distractions, we might call them today. There 
weren't the opportunities to leave the campus and

30:31.485 --> 30:37.472
participate in things. You just weren't as 
mobile. So all of those things, I think, created a

30:41.216 --> 30:45.501
much stronger bond. among the students than at 
other institutions those days and compared to

30:45.970 --> 30:53.598
today. Those are things that you consider unique 
then about A&M? Well certainly, of course, my

30:58.704 --> 31:00.946
goodness. We marched to meals. We ate together all 
at one time. So those things were very unique. in

31:11.671 --> 31:15.977
bonding together, relationship among the 
students. You were expected to know traditions,

31:17.559 --> 31:23.767
to introduce yourself to everybody as a freshman. 
I said there were no disadvantages being an ROTC,

31:25.629 --> 31:31.637
and I'm sure that's one right there. Obviously,

31:32.174 --> 31:42.806
when you walked into a group and there were 25 or 30 
upperclassmen around, you had to introduce

31:32.174 --> 31:42.806
yourself to every one of them. So I'm sure I 
developed a terrible habit of not paying any

31:43.987 --> 31:49.333
attention to what their names were. In the office, 
you couldn't remember them all. And I think that's

31:51.315 --> 31:55.660
a habit I developed that still persists. I have 
trouble remembering names of people because of

31:55.680 --> 32:01.827
that.

32:04.743 --> 32:12.272
And the Farmer Students Association, they were 
respected so

32:04.743 --> 32:12.272
much.
