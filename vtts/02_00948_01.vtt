WEBVTT

00:05.667 --> 00:07.851
This is February 22, 1985. We are in the Crowne 
Plaza Hotel in Dallas, Texas. This is Bob Cornish,

00:15.724 --> 00:18.568
and I'm interviewing Bob Wegner. Bob, you've been 
in the Texas chapter and in Texas for many years.

00:26.141 --> 00:31.590
Why don't you tell us about your beginning in Texas 
planning? OK, in 1951,

00:32.363 --> 00:49.104
in the spring, the city of San Antonio held an 
election in which they had a referendum adopting

00:32.363 --> 00:49.104
the council manager form of government, as a 
consequence of which two things. First, the city,

00:50.146 --> 00:58.877
then 36 square miles, a six mile square, became 
much much larger as a result of going to the council

01:00.460 --> 01:29.674
manager form annexation took place on a large 
scale secondly the city was staff was reorganized

01:00.460 --> 01:29.674
and professionalized including the 
establishment for the first time of a department

01:00.460 --> 01:29.674
of planning both of these things led to my coming to 
san antonio and then ultimately to my leaving it

01:00.460 --> 01:29.674
two and a half years later in june of 52 Just after 
graduating from Harvard, I was hired by

01:30.397 --> 01:53.822
then-director William O. Parker to be the 
assistant director of slum clearance and urban

01:30.397 --> 01:53.822
redevelopment, which the city was undertaking 
per its charter provision as a new council manager

01:30.397 --> 01:53.822
city. And it turned out, after about six months and 
a suit by some builders or developers or some

01:54.697 --> 02:24.113
similar group in San Antonio, that the charter 
provision was not sufficient authority for the

01:54.697 --> 02:24.113
city to get into slum clearance and urban 
redevelopment and take advantage of the federal

01:54.697 --> 02:24.113
legislation available for that purpose. that 
state and Navy legislation was required. And so

02:27.204 --> 02:32.589
the Office of Slum Clearance and Redevelopment 
was abolished. Yes? Bob, do you know who the

02:32.869 --> 02:37.854
planning director before Parker was? According 
to my understanding, Bill Parker was the first

02:37.874 --> 02:44.320
planning director under the new council manager 
form. And prior to that time, I'm just unaware. I

02:47.323 --> 02:51.147
was led to believe that they did not even have a 
planning department prior to that time. So Bill or

02:51.920 --> 02:57.285
Winston Martin would probably be able to tell you 
about that. During the six months I was in the slum

02:59.547 --> 03:20.745
clearance redevelopment, as assistant 
director, I had the privilege, really, of hiring

02:59.547 --> 03:20.745
the first professional planner that I ever hired, 
who happened to be Wolfgang G. Rosler, who is now

02:59.547 --> 03:20.745
the head of the Department of Planning Texas A&M 
Urban and Regional Planning. And make that acting

03:23.819 --> 03:25.741
department. Acting department, as much as he had 
somewhat, had been in the position for several

03:25.761 --> 03:33.671
years and then left it just to go back to teaching. 
And now because of the reorganization going on

03:33.711 --> 03:40.179
there, he is stepping in temporarily to fill that 
position. And he did some very fascinating

03:40.880 --> 03:42.782
things. One of the things that he did while he was 
there that I remember was, and I worked with him on

03:42.802 --> 03:50.091
it, and then after he left it, he only stayed a very 
short time, was to establish census tracts for the

03:50.594 --> 03:54.459
city of San Antonio. That was the first 
accomplishment. The 1950 census had been

03:56.162 --> 04:17.631
conducted there without census tracts, and he 
outlined a program for formalizing them or

03:56.162 --> 04:17.631
creating them, and then I followed through on the 
technical work needed to help achieve that by

03:56.162 --> 04:17.631
using aerial photographs and such and taking the 
block statistics and prorating the counts and all

04:18.016 --> 04:29.530
that kind of thing, using some students from 
Trinity University in a sociology class there and

04:18.016 --> 04:29.530
a bunch of freedom calculators who actually make 
the conversion. And so we gave them their first set

04:30.051 --> 04:35.097
of census tracts, which then stood them in good 
stead in 1960. That was the real tangible

04:35.557 --> 04:38.281
accomplishment. The second thing that I worked on 
in San Antonio was, after leaving, I went to the

04:38.301 --> 04:47.432
planning department then.

04:47.817 --> 04:52.982
worked on drafting a revision of their zoning 
ordinance. Unfortunately, my efforts, I think,

04:53.803 --> 04:57.367
were all for naught. Because in the spring of 53, 
partly as a consequence of the first item that I

04:58.448 --> 05:17.807
mentioned at the beginning, the large 
annexation, there were a large number of

04:58.448 --> 05:17.807
disgruntled voters in San Antonio who were 
exploited by some of the powers that were at the

05:18.057 --> 05:28.349
time, and they were so-called anti-manager 
forces, were elected to the council. A man named

05:29.029 --> 05:36.117
White, who was associated with the White Hotel 
chain, was their leader, and he had been a council

05:29.029 --> 05:36.117
member previously. Anyway, what happened was 
that they wanted to get rid of the manager, C.A.

05:41.924 --> 05:45.668
Harrell, who at that time was the preeminent 
manager in the country, having just left some 25

05:45.918 --> 05:51.525
years as city manager in Cincinnati. And CA 
Harrell very wisely had a contract that left them

05:52.226 --> 06:01.737
virtually no way to fire him, because there was no 
cause to fire him. He had performed ably, and there

06:01.777 --> 06:05.602
was no complaint about his performance. So they 
took what choice they did, and that was to reduce

06:06.162 --> 06:15.874
his salary to $1 a year, under which circumstances 
he was obliged to resign. And shortly thereafter,

06:16.394 --> 06:24.542
they had a sequence of six city managers in six 
months, mainly department heads. Then finally,

06:24.602 --> 06:25.903
they settled down. But in the meantime, they cut 
the budget back very drastically. And yours truly

06:31.509 --> 06:37.354
was, at each budget period, getting a little bit 
less and a little bit less. So that by the time I left

06:37.875 --> 06:45.422
in the fall of 54, I was earning 20% less than I had 
started with. back two and a half years earlier.

06:48.391 --> 06:58.366
While in San Antonio, in addition to Bill Parker, 
the assistant director at the beginning was M.

06:48.391 --> 06:58.366
Winston Martin. When the changeover came and 
Harrell left, Bill Parker was one of those

06:59.427 --> 07:14.650
department heads who resigned, and M. Winston 
Martin became the planning director and remained

06:59.427 --> 07:14.650
such for a long time, and it was largely due to his 
support that I was even able to remain as an

07:15.001 --> 07:21.687
employee there at all, given the very tough budget 
situation that we had. And I was forever grateful

07:22.127 --> 07:25.250
to him that he did give me that support. Also on the 
staff at the time were two other gentlemen who

07:25.831 --> 07:36.260
achieved some prominence later in private 
practice in the firm of Mormon, Mock, and Green.

07:36.320 --> 07:39.043
And these were Ed Mock and Bob Green. Ed, I believe, 
was an architect by initial training. And Bob

07:43.266 --> 07:45.008
Green was a landscape architect The two of them 
eventually teamed up with a fellow named Mormon

07:45.460 --> 07:57.036
and had offices both in San Antonio and Houston and 
did some rather outstanding design work. I think

07:57.056 --> 07:59.519
that they still are practicing. The firm still 
exists. The name has just recently been changed.

08:03.845 --> 08:12.177
Ed Mock having died within the last two years, and 
Bob Green is probably in a semi-retired, if not a

08:03.845 --> 08:12.177
fully retired, state. And I know is enjoying that 
very much. Going down to Peru to view the comet in

08:16.555 --> 08:22.382
about a month or two. Right now, maybe. Anyways, 
the next association I had with Texas, I left there

08:24.304 --> 08:32.594
right around Thanksgiving or Halloween or 
something like that. And my last day in the office,

08:33.375 --> 08:41.725
I recall, I taped a... short program for the APA, or 
then the AIP, where I had been scheduled to give a

08:42.008 --> 08:51.943
talk about preparing the planning budget. And I 
had to put it onto a dictaphone disk and send it on

08:52.744 --> 09:00.075
since I wasn't going to be able to attend the 
session. And that was my last effort at the time to

09:00.095 --> 09:04.482
help support the progression in Texas. Some other 
things I did while I was there that I just recall now

09:05.303 --> 09:11.492
was that I went around the state with some 
representatives of the state health department

09:11.877 --> 09:23.234
one William Bell, who I believe was an attorney or a 
legal counsel for the health department, talking

09:11.877 --> 09:23.234
about and trying to promote the idea of urban 
redevelopment. And some of the ideas that were

09:23.254 --> 09:39.218
coming to the fore at that time, some of the federal 
housing and home finance agency programs that

09:23.254 --> 09:39.218
cities could use, I went with Mr. Bell and went 
around the state talking on two or three or four

09:23.254 --> 09:39.218
occasions. Later on, toward the end of the 50s, 
after some very successful work in Tulsa, which

09:40.683 --> 10:07.653
was a kind of a pioneering-type planning city, we 
got into a program which involved Fort Worth along

09:40.683 --> 10:07.653
with the metropolitan planning agencies in Tulsa 
and Little Rock and Wichita, Kansas, as well as the

09:40.683 --> 10:07.653
city and county of Denver planning agency. This 
was a five-way... demonstration project funded

10:10.653 --> 10:24.189
by, I think it was Housing and Home Finance Agency 
in the late 50s, to develop a computer, a data

10:10.653 --> 10:24.189
management system, really, using computer 
technology. And we call it the Metropolitan Data

10:24.630 --> 10:26.993
Center Project. It went on for some two to three 
years. I started out as one of the conceivers of the

10:30.177 --> 10:39.428
project and came to Fort Worth on several 
occasions and visited with the staff there. The

10:39.931 --> 10:48.943
director at that time, Mike Mahoney, may remember 
who it was because it was a guy who had a civil

10:39.931 --> 10:48.943
engineering background. But the city of Fort 
Worth gave excellent support to the program, and

10:48.963 --> 11:03.942
they actually were one of the cities that really 
used some of the experience in data management

10:48.963 --> 11:03.942
that we developed in that program. And one of the 
other byproducts was a system that eventually was

11:04.503 --> 11:09.229
adopted by HUD as the format for land use systems, 
which was the concept of a parcel record, which had

11:09.715 --> 11:29.562
land use as one basic element, structure design as 
a second element, and then structure use as a third

11:09.715 --> 11:29.562
element. How does this relate to the work of Al 
Gutenberg and his multiple land use

11:29.582 --> 11:34.628
classifications? I think that either they were 
parallel Or they were one led to the other. And in

11:44.268 --> 11:46.791
terms of time, I don't know exactly the timing. I do 
know that we did use the basic SIC code as the main

11:46.811 --> 11:59.145
one for coding of land use and for structure use as 
well. So the exact history of that I'm not that well

12:00.025 --> 12:02.808
acquainted with. But I know that we were either 
together or one came just before the other and one

12:02.828 --> 12:07.954
borrowed from the other. HHFA never gave him any 
credit for his work. Well, that's very

12:13.053 --> 12:35.421
unfortunate, because apparently, I know that one 
of our coworkers in Tulsa had been on the committee

12:13.053 --> 12:35.421
that name was in the booklet that came up with the 
harder HHFA land classification system, which

12:13.053 --> 12:35.421
was also endorsed by the highway. Dot. or whatever 
it was, the Highway Administration. Well, it was

12:39.154 --> 12:40.255
the Bureau of Public Roads. Bureau of Public 
Roads, yeah. Federal Highway Administration.

12:43.258 --> 12:54.487
And that was, his name was Donald, come to me later, 
Bond, but he'd also worked with Erling Helland for

12:43.258 --> 12:54.487
a while, and he went up to Kansas City and worked 
there. In fact, he even became the director of

12:54.847 --> 12:58.651
planning in Kansas City, and then went into 
private practice. The last thing I knew about him,

12:59.191 --> 13:07.438
he was working with some of the underground 
storage areas in the old abandoned mines right

12:59.191 --> 13:07.438
outside of Kansas City, or some of us even in the 
city, Woodard. His name is Don Woodard,

13:09.995 --> 13:19.967
W-O-O-D-A-R-D, and he was, his name is listed in 
that booklet, and he was on our staff when the data

13:09.995 --> 13:19.967
center was going on, that study was going on. Then, 
what brought me to Texas was a study done by the

13:20.147 --> 13:36.227
Texas Research League in the mid-60s, about the 
time that some forces in Texas, including some in

13:20.147 --> 13:36.227
north central Texas very strongly, including 
Tommy Vandegrift were pushing for in Arlington

13:36.612 --> 13:49.949
were pushing for state legislation to authorize 
multi-county planning agencies, councils of

13:36.612 --> 13:49.949
governments, and so forth. Was Vandegrift mayor 
at that time? He was mayor at that time, yes. He was

13:53.133 --> 14:02.906
mayor for, as you probably recall, some 20 to 25 
years, and that was right in the middle or part of

13:53.133 --> 14:02.906
the latter half of that time period. Home years. 
Yes. And anyways, Whatever groups, Mr.

14:06.565 --> 14:19.256
Vandegrift and others prevailed upon the 
legislature to see the wisdom of adopting a

14:06.565 --> 14:19.256
neighboring legislation for COGS or regional 
councils, if they're generically known. And as

14:19.937 --> 14:31.768
part of the foundation of this, I believe, the 
Texas Research League entered into a study of

14:19.937 --> 14:31.768
metropolitan planning. And as a part of which, 
they came to, or some of their team, came to Tulsa

14:35.759 --> 14:40.985
and interviewed me as, at that time, the director 
of planning. And I had taken over from Glenn

14:41.806 --> 14:54.060
Turner, who had succeeded Erling Helland, who was 
the first director, back in 53 when it was founded.

14:54.681 --> 14:59.066
And then in 54 or 55, I believe, Turner came on. And 
then in 63, I came on. So sometime between 63 and the

15:02.506 --> 15:17.024
end of 66, essentially, probably in 65, people 
from the Texas Research League came in and

15:02.506 --> 15:17.024
interviewed me about how was the Tulsa 
Metropolitan Area Planning Commission working?

15:17.064 --> 15:17.865
How did that function? And they wanted to use it in 
their study of metropolitan planning for Texas.

15:23.272 --> 15:26.496
And there are reports of that study available. And 
they were, if not precedent or support for, the

15:31.919 --> 15:40.252
legislation that enabled COGS to be established 
in Texas, they at least were part of that same

15:31.919 --> 15:40.252
movement of support. The COGS in Texas were sort of 
a remake of the previous economic development

15:41.254 --> 15:52.691
districts, EDDs, that had existed before. 
Pursuant to what, some National Resources

15:53.813 --> 15:58.280
Planning Board thing? No, it was after that. But 
these were then converted into COGS, likely.

16:03.441 --> 16:05.323
Well, no, let me give you a bit more about that. 
Another link that tied me with this, which you may

16:06.464 --> 16:20.880
be familiar with, because our paths first crossed 
back in the mid and late 50s when Tulsa was doing a

16:06.464 --> 16:20.880
central business district plan. And you were a 
member of the consulting team of Noitre and

16:20.940 --> 16:28.268
Alexander that was doing the plan for the Tulsa 
Metropolitan Area Planning Commission. At the

16:28.737 --> 16:34.645
same time, another member of that team was Harold 
F. Wise, who had his own consulting firm. And one of

16:35.266 --> 16:45.901
the things that he eventually did was to prepare 
plans and work programs for state planning. In

16:46.462 --> 16:53.351
fact, he became the single planner that prepared 
more state plans of that type than any other. And

16:53.952 --> 16:58.018
among those that he was working on was Texas. And so 
he was instrumental in his own limited way in

16:58.353 --> 17:10.191
having an influence upon the formation of the 
state planning regions in Texas, which then

16:58.353 --> 17:10.191
became the home base for each of the COGs. And he did 
prepare also, after I came to Texas in January of

17:10.812 --> 17:25.594
67, one year after the North Central Texas COG was 
established, he was the man that we hired to

17:10.812 --> 17:25.594
prepare our initial work program. And he foresaw a 
budget that none of us would believe at the time. If

17:29.865 --> 17:35.231
we saw a budget of several million dollars, I 
believe it was two million dollars in a short

17:29.865 --> 17:35.231
period of time. Well, the way it turned out was 
ultimately the budget of the North Central Texas

17:35.251 --> 17:55.613
COG went to ten million dollars, and it also turned 
out that the size of the staff increased for the

17:35.251 --> 17:55.613
first, let me see, probably, I'll say roughly ten 
years at the rate of one person a month on the

17:35.251 --> 17:55.613
average. The staff was actually, in November of 
66, when Bill Pitstick, who was still director,

17:55.897 --> 18:09.792
was hired, through, let's say, 10 years, there 
were 120 people on the staff 10 years later. And

18:10.513 --> 18:25.870
Bill and Dan Petty, who was the second person to be 
hired, and I, who was the fourth, the third having

18:10.513 --> 18:25.870
been Bill's secretary, Linda Farr at that time, 
just couldn't believe that Harold Franklin Wise

18:26.339 --> 18:30.263
was correct in his predictions about how far the 
budget would go. As a matter of fact, he turned out

18:30.283 --> 18:51.486
to be conservative, all due, of course, to the 
availability of large amounts of federal aids for

18:30.283 --> 18:51.486
not only physical development planning and water 
planning and transportation planning, but also

18:30.283 --> 18:51.486
the various kinds of social and health-related 
planning and that kind of thing. NCTCOG in the

18:52.647 --> 18:58.553
January of 67. I came in as the director of regional 
planning and then did several other things,

19:00.075 --> 19:17.372
including being invited to be active in the AIP at 
that time. From the outset of the short course back

19:17.960 --> 19:39.949
in around 1970, due to your, Bob Cornish, your 
initiative bringing the idea that you'd worked on

19:17.960 --> 19:39.949
in California to Texas with you, starting this 
short course, I was invited to take part in that

19:17.960 --> 19:39.949
from the very, and be on the task force from the very 
outset. Frankly, I must admit, during the first

19:40.590 --> 19:45.857
year, my participation was in name I was never able 
to get to any of the committee meetings, and there

19:46.141 --> 19:51.627
were three or four years and all that. And it was 
only after that that I became active. We paid all

19:55.011 --> 19:56.453
the expenses. Well, be that as it may, maybe I 
didn't know that, whatever it was. It was a very,

20:01.078 --> 20:04.623
very busy time at Cog, and it was very demanding 
work. And at any rate, we initiated all kinds of new

20:05.303 --> 20:11.811
programs there. I don't know how much of that 
history you want me to recount. I should say this.

20:16.795 --> 20:29.008
The Texas Association of Regional Councils has 
commissioned a history of regional councils in

20:16.795 --> 20:29.008
Texas, which I believe Jim Ray is preparing. And 
this is supposed to be available at the end of this

20:29.548 --> 20:41.140
year, hopefully at the TARC annual conference in 
fall, which I believe will be in Galveston. I'm not

20:41.440 --> 20:42.602
sure about them anyways. That will be available to 
celebrate the 20th anniversary of the

20:43.222 --> 20:47.529
establishments of COGS in Texas. And so rather 
than my trying to take time with that, I'll just

20:48.109 --> 21:01.228
skip that and ask you whether you want me to talk 
about the Educational Foundation and the short

20:48.109 --> 21:01.228
course perhaps as a little bit of something else 
that I was involved in. Why don't you start first

21:02.950 --> 21:10.080
with the short course and how that got 
metamorphosed into the Educational Foundation.

21:10.398 --> 21:19.571
The short course, and again, you were the fellow 
that promoted, initiated the idea here, based

21:10.398 --> 21:19.571
upon what you'd done in California. And there is a 
paper that I think I provided you a copy with

21:19.611 --> 21:28.624
recently that I found in my file that you wrote 
about two years after. I mean, it was late 60s,

21:28.644 --> 21:31.509
something like that. And it recounts part of that 
history, and it was based upon, I think, the first

21:32.170 --> 21:37.798
short course that was held in San Antonio. You 
actually told the story of that. And the idea here

21:40.672 --> 21:46.779
was that this is a growing state, a state in which 
planning is growing. The numbers of professional

21:46.799 --> 21:48.921
planners were rising. The number of cities 
undertaking planning, appointing planning

21:49.402 --> 21:55.208
agencies, adopting zoning, et cetera, were 
increasing all the time. And Texas, a state that

21:55.789 --> 22:10.645
now has some 1,000-plus cities and then had nearly 
that same number, and great demand for planning

21:55.789 --> 22:10.645
and for planning and zoning commissioners, and 
precious little background very few

22:11.148 --> 22:21.719
professional planners on the job, and so there was 
a great need, a great demand evident to those of us

22:11.148 --> 22:21.719
in the profession for training of local 
officials. We thought primarily of planning and

22:21.839 --> 22:29.207
zoning commissioners, but we also included the 
city council members and other elected

22:21.839 --> 22:29.207
officials. So that came a little later. Well, but 
the idea, but the name was added to the title after

22:30.608 --> 22:35.753
only about two or three years, really. Initially 
it was a short course for planning commissioners,

22:39.667 --> 22:49.940
And that, as I say, I've collected a little copy of 
the programs, and I don't have all of them, but they

22:39.667 --> 22:49.940
will be completed and become part of the 
Foundation archives. And Mike McAnally is going

22:50.701 --> 22:53.585
to help get that all together. And so I also refer 
you to the summary, which I have compiled, such as

22:53.985 --> 23:04.058
it is, with the names of the various coordinators 
who ran each of the short courses. I really think

23:04.078 --> 23:07.783
that we ought to have the people on the task force as 
well as the coordinator. Yeah, the task force

23:07.983 --> 23:10.686
names are going to be on there, too. Yeah, because 
they're the ones that initially the idea was to

23:10.946 --> 23:16.611
provide policy. And then the coordinators were to 
administer the policy. So it's important to have

23:21.135 --> 23:25.499
those policy centers down there. Well, as a matter 
of fact, you read my own mind when you said it.

23:28.963 --> 23:36.690
Because what I did was I tried to make a very brief 
summary of the years from 1970 to 71 right through

23:36.940 --> 23:53.298
1985 with both the sites of the short course, the 
dates of the short course, the coordinator of the

23:36.940 --> 23:53.298
short course, and the size of the task. All right, 
with the short course summary being inserted at

23:53.318 --> 24:00.186
this point, then I would suggest that we talk about 
the Educational Foundation. And the impetus for

24:00.206 --> 24:05.952
starting on this was somewhat vague in my mind, but 
maybe you can help recall. Well, I think John

24:11.458 --> 24:19.349
Shanahan was the president at the time, and I was 
vice president in that chapter. And John, having

24:20.190 --> 24:34.470
had substantial business experience and also 
with being a lobbyist, was concerned about the net

24:20.190 --> 24:34.470
proceeds that we were making every year, which 
amounted to a couple thousand dollars. And the

24:35.125 --> 24:42.714
question of being tax exempt came up in terms of 
income tax. And so after substantial

24:42.734 --> 25:00.697
investigation around Austin with non-taxable 
corporations and foundations and so forth,

24:42.734 --> 25:00.697
Shanahan came up with the idea that we ought to 
create an educational foundation as an adjunct to

24:42.734 --> 25:00.697
the chapter. And that overlapping directorate so 
that it would be a separate entity, but it would be

25:04.049 --> 25:10.596
controlled by the chapter and reflect chapter 
policy. And so three of us were signatories to the

25:11.958 --> 25:19.626
creation of the corporation, which then 
incorporated. It is an incorporation, as I

25:19.646 --> 25:22.369
understand it. Prior to that time, a name that you 
and John and John Cunningham, from then the

25:22.469 --> 25:32.740
director of planning in El Paso, who had been very 
active on this, short course task force and had

25:33.260 --> 25:40.808
been chairman of the short course task force for a 
couple of years were the, were the incorporators.

25:41.549 --> 25:45.974
The three were required under state law to sign the 
articles of incorporation. The articles of

25:45.994 --> 25:57.347
incorporation and the bylaws were prepared by a 
short course of an educational foundation task

25:45.994 --> 25:57.347
force, which I volunteered to head. I told John 
that was the one thing I was really interested in

25:57.787 --> 26:00.330
doing. somewhere around 1975 that the work 
started, and then it culminated in 76. So that was

26:06.088 --> 26:09.713
the actual year of incorporation. And the article 
of incorporation, I guess you'd call them, which

26:10.594 --> 26:22.289
is equivalent to the constitution of the body, 
remained intact. There'd been no changes in that.

26:24.212 --> 26:28.798
The bylaws had changed slightly and so forth. but 
the overlapping terms and the ex-officio offices

26:28.897 --> 26:44.071
which linked the educational foundation, indeed 
a separate corporate body, but linked to the

26:28.897 --> 26:44.071
chapter, which itself is incorporated. And part 
of the idea of incorporating influenced the

26:44.651 --> 26:50.357
chapter, but the foundation was separate. Why was 
it separate? Well, it was separate for one reason.

26:53.019 --> 26:56.102
The chapter's purposes included lobbying, And 
the foundations exclude lobbying in purely

26:57.027 --> 27:03.793
research, educational, and maybe moscenary 
purposes. It was put in a different tax category

27:04.193 --> 27:07.876
from an IRS point of view. And that was the 
reasoning behind it. Yeah, we wanted to make sure

27:10.198 --> 27:14.242
we weren't going to be done by IRS. Yes. And we 
invited you and John and John Cunningham to be the

27:15.963 --> 27:26.292
incorporators because of your key roles process 
of the short course. And the main thing that the

27:28.571 --> 27:38.923
foundation was charged with doing, and we might 
insert in here somewhere, are there the articles

27:28.571 --> 27:38.923
of incorporation in the bylaws? I don't know if the 
purposes are cited there, or at least extracts

27:38.943 --> 27:43.348
from them would be appropriate at this point. 
Yeah. That would be in the appendix. Yeah. The

27:45.651 --> 27:54.962
short course was definitely the key thing that 
they're supposed to do, but all other forms of help

27:45.651 --> 27:54.962
to the educational activities related to 
planning in the state, both for lay planners and

27:55.381 --> 28:03.370
professional planners, were included as part of 
the legitimate purpose of the foundation. So with

28:04.191 --> 28:10.037
that, I'd ask you what else you'd like me to talk 
about. A

28:10.057 --> 28:19.027
quick summary of activity at the Council of 
Governments. I was instrumental in the formation

28:19.908 --> 28:23.852
of the initial COG and helped to developed some of 
the things that are not planning, per se, but which

28:24.322 --> 28:29.407
became part of the earmuffs of that cog. And that 
was the initial annual retreats that were

28:29.428 --> 28:33.872
established there. Some of the annual work 
programs that were developed there I had great

28:33.932 --> 28:41.841
inputs to. And some of the things that I personally 
developed are still a part of that, the idea of rank

28:41.921 --> 28:53.974
ordering all the cities within the region and that 
kind of thing, the idea of comparing size of the COG

28:54.376 --> 28:57.961
with the rest of the country and other states. In 
fact, North Central Texas section now has

28:58.381 --> 29:07.253
compared its membership with several other state 
chapters and that kind of thing. It's part of the, I

29:07.573 --> 29:13.180
must say, the Texas syndrome of bigger and better 
boosterism kind of thing. Well, you've got quite a

29:13.441 --> 29:20.730
role to play in the 1970 census data book for that 
North Central Texas COG. Personally, I didn't

29:22.962 --> 29:25.484
have so much that people around my staff did. A lot 
of times, inappropriately,

29:25.504 --> 29:37.155
I think that I may have gotten credit for some 
things that really people who worked for me were

29:25.504 --> 29:37.155
doing. And indeed, there was a data book that was 
developed by COG from the 1970 census and a very

29:37.676 --> 29:43.702
important contribution. And again, it used the 
computer technology to develop all these things

29:43.742 --> 29:52.750
and then was replicated in 1980 by COG and his two 
urban studies at UT Arlington, once again, the

29:53.000 --> 29:58.265
same kind of thing. And eventually, the number of 
people qualified in computer technology that

29:58.965 --> 30:17.862
came onto the staff to do the transportation 
planning and to develop the various models for

29:58.965 --> 30:17.862
projecting population and land use became very 
sophisticated and much beyond my own

29:58.965 --> 30:17.862
capabilities and experience. But as far as the 
data management thing, in fact, I might add that

30:22.480 --> 30:44.146
When in Tulsa, with the Metropolitan Data Center 
project, those of us who were involved became some

30:22.480 --> 30:44.146
of the initial, I shouldn't say initial founders, 
but some of the founders of the group known as

30:22.480 --> 30:44.146
URISA, the Urban and Regional Information 
Systems Association, which now is probably the

30:22.480 --> 30:44.146
preeminent body of its type for city and state and 
county and so forth. The brothers at Osborne were

30:44.366 --> 30:47.430
involved in that, weren't they? Osgood. Osgood. 
Osgood were on, both of those were on the staff, and

30:48.491 --> 30:52.015
they joined us shortly after. in the late 50s, as I 
recall, Don Osgood, the elder, becoming

30:52.383 --> 31:01.191
eventually the director following my stint there 
in Tulsa. And the other one, the younger one, he

31:01.751 --> 31:13.281
eventually moved to Texas and was the head of the 
North Central Texas section of the APA. He has

31:13.801 --> 31:18.766
since moved back to Tulsa, as I recall, and they may 
be in partnership again. But he had gone on to... to

31:21.762 --> 31:27.739
Georgia Tech, got his master's degree on some 
facet of airport planning and he'd been working

31:21.762 --> 31:27.739
with
