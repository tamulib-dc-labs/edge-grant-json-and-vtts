WEBVTT

00:01.297 --> 00:12.532
Okay,

00:01.297 --> 00:12.532
Mr. Peters, you were going to tell me something 
about your great-grandparents or grandparents

00:01.297 --> 00:12.532
or whatever you remembered about where they came 
from and what brought them into this area. I can't,

00:12.772 --> 00:21.524
like I say, my own grandparents, as far as I know, 
were raised right here. But I've heard them

00:23.186 --> 00:30.055
talking about grandparents

00:23.186 --> 00:30.055
on one side where one of them was, Grandpa Peters 
was a German fellow, and his wife was

00:30.288 --> 00:43.650
Irish. And I heard my daddy say that, you know, they 
couldn't talk plain English. But I guess that's

00:53.967 --> 00:56.211
far back.

00:59.313 --> 01:05.240
Like I said, my other grandparents, as far as I 
know, they were raised right here around

00:59.313 --> 01:05.240
Bradstown County, I guess. Did you go—you said you 
went to school, some of the earlier grades in

01:06.821 --> 01:10.445
school. Did you go here? Yeah. Tell me something 
about where the schoolhouse was and who taught or

01:12.087 --> 01:16.112
whatever you remember about that. Well, the first 
school I ever went to was—my

01:16.993 --> 01:26.383
only school I ever went to was right down here. What 
community center? Oh, it's about two miles from

01:28.473 --> 01:31.977
here, I reckon, two and a half, three miles. And 
that's where I started and that's where I wound up,

01:33.679 --> 01:40.066
right down there. 10, you tell me something about 
school. What was it like then, as best you

01:41.528 --> 01:43.570
remember? Well, them days, they had one teacher to 
have several grades, you know. And this school

01:49.336 --> 01:52.540
down here, we went through the ninth grade. And 
they had three teachers. You remember who they

01:54.885 --> 01:55.546
were? Yeah, I remember some of them. Mr. Rich 
MacDonald, Mr. Barden,

01:59.070 --> 02:18.072
and Mr. Barden's wife, and

01:59.070 --> 02:18.072
they were devoused in Buckhannon.

02:20.650 --> 02:36.014
I know when I was in, first year I was in school, 
trying to learn my letters, they tell it on me and I

02:20.650 --> 02:36.014
know it so, but they laugh at me yet about it. When I 
got the S, that night before, Papa told me, he said,

02:37.556 --> 02:44.787
you ought to remember that, it looked like a snake. 
And the next day I called, They called it S. I told

02:48.629 --> 02:51.313
them, no, that's a snake. My papa said, that's a 
snake.

02:58.664 --> 03:01.888
But they were strict teachers them days. I mean, a 
student, you didn't talk back to your teacher.

03:07.316 --> 03:08.538
What would happen? What would happen? Well, them 
teachers'd tear you up them days. They sure would.

03:13.725 --> 03:15.548
And then, another thing, if you... better keep it a 
secret until your daddy get older when you got home

03:15.950 --> 03:37.654
because when when you got out of line when you got to 
look at the two lemon days why they figured you know

03:15.950 --> 03:37.654
if you ever fought with a man it was always for a day 
but i

03:15.950 --> 03:37.654
just started saying that's about all i had to say 
about it You know, my father can tell, has told me

03:37.803 --> 03:45.552
before of getting up and going hunting or doing the 
chores or whatever, and then going to school and

03:37.803 --> 03:45.552
coming home and finishing up. Did you have to do the 
same thing? Yeah. Yeah, my job was feeding the

03:48.496 --> 03:51.279
horses. Mews back then, they, you know, farmed 
with mews and had horses, took eggs and canned

03:51.739 --> 04:02.252
them, plowed them too, worked them to the buggy. We 
had a, my daddy had a carriage, you know what that

04:02.292 --> 04:07.058
is? Mm-hmm. and two-seated buggy thing and 
carried with his top on it and worked two horses to

04:07.756 --> 04:14.263
it. And that's the way we went to church them days 
and of course town too. We'd go to town about time.

04:22.252 --> 04:32.303
But I've seen the day when a neighbor down below us 
here would come by here with the roaches to bed in

04:22.252 --> 04:32.303
the winter before Christmas. I've seen that 
happen. Come out here with a four-mule wagon, you

04:34.908 --> 04:46.807
know, four mules to one wagon, and my sister and my 
mother would get in with them and they'd go on the

04:34.908 --> 04:46.807
run and do the Christmas shopping. But that was a 
pretty tough day so far as getting in and out is

04:46.827 --> 04:50.934
concerned. I bet it was. That brings up another 
point I'd be very interested in knowing. I have

04:55.040 --> 05:01.050
heard my parents and my grandparents tell me for a 
long time that Christmases today just aren't what

04:55.040 --> 05:01.050
they used to be. Now, I'd be really interested in 
knowing about what Christmas was to you in this

05:01.435 --> 05:07.063
area when you were a kid. Well, we had a lot of fun. 
Like I said a while ago, we had those parties, you

05:09.687 --> 05:14.634
know, over during Christmas. Play parties. We had 
a lot of fun in those days. Just lots of fun. Doing

05:23.187 --> 05:26.211
the first one thing, playing pranks on people.

05:34.747 --> 05:38.412
Well, I can't remember what the word was. You're 
like me. You don't want to tell your pranks, do you?

05:44.279 --> 05:46.462
No, I can't remember too much about it. I know we had 
a big time.

06:01.902 --> 06:04.365
You talked about farming and ranching earlier. uh 
what did most people do which of those two in uh say

06:04.717 --> 06:27.130
in 1910 or you mean when the ranchers are far right 
more of the farm more of the farm

06:04.717 --> 06:27.130
okay that brings up a very interesting point then 
uh the invention of a lot of farm machinery Must

06:27.650 --> 06:30.253
have changed the way people farm tremendously. 
Oh, yeah. I'm sure you know something about that.

06:32.897 --> 06:37.042
Can you remember when the first tractor came in or 
when the first combine or whatever? I'm sure they

06:39.345 --> 06:41.327
used to pick cotton here by hand, didn't they? Oh, 
yeah. That's the only way you can plow it with

06:41.888 --> 06:46.574
mules, too. When I was a kid, they plowed one mule. 
And when they're breaking the land, they'd make

06:53.502 --> 06:57.747
four furs. They'd plow right down the side of the 
cotton stalk, you know, like here, and throw the

06:58.108 --> 07:05.757
fur this way, and then they'd come back over here on 
this side. And then they'd go back then and make two

07:05.857 --> 07:12.044
furs to run that middle there. And everybody used 
just one mule every day to break land. But then

07:15.188 --> 07:22.817
later on, they got to breaking with two mules and 
plow a little deeper, you know, and break the land a

07:15.188 --> 07:22.817
little deeper. And then later on in that, well, 
they got to using three mules to break land with a

07:23.540 --> 07:34.792
middle buster and really put it down in the ground 
to plow, you know, to make it deep. But I don't

07:34.812 --> 07:39.777
remember what year the tractors come in there, but 
we didn't own a tractor. We didn't own a tractor

07:41.359 --> 07:51.910
till, well, when I worked for my brother over there 
at some time between 33 and 43, that he bought a

07:53.037 --> 07:55.260
tractor when I was working for him. I reckon we had 
an old tractor around somewhere close to 1950. But

08:06.016 --> 08:10.724
it used to be an old wagon, walking. Of course, I 
plowed a steer once. That's the only time I ever

08:16.472 --> 08:17.854
done that. How was that? Well, my granddaddy had a 
family that got sick, the man did, you know, the

08:21.303 --> 08:48.745
colored fellas on the working farm, and he's 
plowing steers, and we put a collar upside down on

08:21.303 --> 08:48.745
the steer, a horse collar, and was plowing cotton, 
and you know, he'd plow dirt and cotton, we'd call

08:21.303 --> 08:48.745
it, we'd have to plow up the next, this row, and this 
way, and then have it come down that way, and I

08:21.303 --> 08:48.745
plowed that old steer over there about, oh, about 
two weeks, I reckon, But that's the only steer I

08:49.703 --> 08:52.907
ever plowed in my life. I plowed mules and horses 
and things like that. That's the only steer I ever

08:56.071 --> 08:57.533
plowed. And then the tanks, everything we did, we 
did with teams. And during that Depression, they,

09:04.743 --> 09:11.612
we tell you about, they did some road work, the 
county did. And I know there's several that did

09:11.632 --> 09:19.542
teamwork on the county building that rolled up, 
you know. Well, there's several of us around the

09:20.028 --> 09:29.980
community here got a job there with scrapers, you 
know, first team and driver's team. Wasn't

09:30.000 --> 09:32.203
getting much, but they'd show a lot of money them 
days. How much were you getting? I can't remember.

09:35.186 --> 09:37.129
Seemed to me like about $3 a day. Seemed like. But 
them days, just a little money could... Now, I

09:39.632 --> 09:48.803
worked. for $50 a month, went to work for $50 a month 
in 33.

09:56.466 --> 10:01.491
And I had an old car, and I fed my family. I had three 
children. Fed my family, and we had that old car to

10:03.533 --> 10:09.118
come back and forth once in a while then. How much 
was gasoline then? I can't remember. Not anything

10:12.421 --> 10:13.802
like it is today? Oh, no, it is. I got to talk about 
that now. It's been here. I don't know if it's been

10:17.906 --> 10:18.807
here. or maybe 12 to 10, 12 years, but it's set when 
it come here on 26th century gallon, you know, and

10:20.305 --> 10:31.537
never had been changed. Can you remember the first 
time you ever rode an automobile?

10:38.024 --> 10:39.366
No, I don't think we can. When was the first time you 
ever saw one? Well, I guess that and on that street

10:43.070 --> 10:46.954
up there about the first night or so. Man, that is a 
show back in them days when you could see a

10:49.060 --> 10:57.813
automobile.

10:57.833 --> 11:14.718
I went one time with my granddaddy and grandmother 
out

10:57.833 --> 11:14.718
towards Crystal City, out in that section of the 
country. My granddaddy's second wife and his

11:15.018 --> 11:18.223
first wife died. And she had a son that lived out 
there, and we went with them out there, three or

11:18.676 --> 11:27.385
four of us kids, to visit with them. And of course, 
that was back when they were selling, you know,

11:27.405 --> 11:32.149
land agents. They sold tons. The warrants had a lot 
of land down in that country. But they carried my

11:36.494 --> 11:37.995
granddaddy around. We was riding with him. And 
this fellow smoking a cigar, I'll never forget

11:40.197 --> 11:42.620
that. And it had tops them days, you know, it wasn't 
like it is now. In the summertime, just push the top

11:47.617 --> 11:51.522
back over it. This fella smoking a cigar and the 
ashes blowed off in my eye. I'd like to kill me. I

11:59.671 --> 12:07.881
sure have been watching anybody smoking when I was 
riding behind them sentient.

12:07.901 --> 12:12.686
You know this lady that works out at the entomology 
building with me, this kitty used to be Rozier. You

12:13.347 --> 12:15.109
remember thinking about her family in this area? 
But no, they lived in the joining community. I know

12:18.252 --> 12:24.941
Kitty all right, and I've been knowing her a long 
time, but I didn't know her before she was married

12:18.252 --> 12:24.941
or anything like that. Do you know anything about 
why her folks came to this area? No, I sure don't.

12:30.448 --> 12:34.313
No,

12:30.448 --> 12:34.313
I don't. Well, is there any particular thing, 
again, that really... impresses you, or has

12:42.241 --> 12:46.204
impressed you, in the past about Bryan College 
Station. For instance, when did you first become

12:46.545 --> 12:50.768
acquainted with the university? And to know, see, 
there's some people out there, or the

12:51.749 --> 12:56.794
university's certainly not like it used to be. Can 
you give me some changes you've noticed in it?

12:59.576 --> 13:06.963
Well, I reckon I've been around college as little 
as anybody has lived. Lived here as long as I ever,

13:06.983 --> 13:10.846
maybe less than anybody. But... Brian, back 
yonder, you know, we drove cattle everywhere. You

13:18.142 --> 13:19.324
didn't haul cattle anywhere. You didn't have no 
way to haul them. You didn't have a road to haul them

13:20.406 --> 13:21.828
on. Chunks of nothing. But we'd drive cattle to 
town, Brian, and out

13:23.271 --> 13:37.797
there where the pasture land end was, it just, how 
you just think it was going to be. Of course, there

13:38.536 --> 13:42.342
wouldn't be no way you could drive cattle out there 
now. But them ladies, them days, would get out on

13:42.903 --> 13:48.934
the yard and have a broom. They didn't want to keep 
cattle up on the lawn. But they drove everything

13:54.223 --> 13:56.747
around.

14:01.182 --> 14:09.273
You remember any big events that have occurred 
around Texas A&M out here that you remember

14:01.182 --> 14:09.273
reading about or hearing about in say in the 1900 
and between 1900 and 1910? I can't remember. Do you

14:12.097 --> 14:15.963
remember any about what the guys did out there 
during the war? Well, no I don't remember much

14:17.645 --> 14:21.891
about that.

14:26.022 --> 14:28.947
The preceding has been a recorded interview with 
Mr. D.L. Doug Peters, lifetime resident of the

14:29.168 --> 14:36.621
Brazos Valley of College Station, rancher, 77 
years of age. The interview was conducted on March

14:37.522 --> 14:43.052
11, 1975, by Carl S. Barfield.
