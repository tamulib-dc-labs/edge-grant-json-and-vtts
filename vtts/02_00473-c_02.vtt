WEBVTT

00:01.432 --> 00:03.354
Who's next guy's going to get shipped out? And I had 
to clean out about half the instructors there

00:04.435 --> 00:12.824
before they got the idea that we were serious about 
this business. And that you were going to have a

00:12.944 --> 00:16.768
technical and not a theoretical school. And a 
technical school, yeah. So that everybody was

00:18.169 --> 00:24.316
working on a breadboard or a piece of equipment.

00:26.077 --> 00:28.620
And so... it worked out pretty well. And would you 
consider that was your main accomplishment down

00:30.514 --> 00:34.119
in Florida? I would say that that was the main 
accomplishment down there, turning it around and

00:34.179 --> 00:41.991
making it into a practical type of school. And did 
it change the quality of the student? Well,

00:45.316 --> 00:46.478
everybody said so. So you got a man who could really 
work on radar. Yeah. And it's amazing. the

00:59.701 --> 01:05.427
individuals who had never had any responsibility 
except to fly airplanes, what kind of job they

00:59.701 --> 01:05.427
would do. I mean, they really would jump in and 
really take over. So about

01:13.816 --> 01:24.307
that time, the war was grinding down. And I went off 
to be 29 in transition school. Well, at the

01:30.937 --> 01:43.575
Florida, could you compare the size of this 
school, the radio school in Sioux Falls and the

01:30.937 --> 01:43.575
radar school in Florida? How many men did you have 
under your command? Oh, the number of students at

01:46.238 --> 01:52.307
the radar school is just about half of the number at 
the radio school.

01:55.391 --> 01:58.395
And of course, the other thing at Boca Raton, 
Florida is that every time they get a commander, he

01:59.995 --> 02:07.966
would get fired or get transferred. I had more than 
a year and a half, I think, that I was there. I was

02:12.652 --> 02:19.922
acting base commander longer than any guy that was 
stationed there. What do you attribute that to?

02:23.941 --> 02:36.196
Well, it was very, at that time it was very fluid 
because the individual, the senior officers who

02:23.941 --> 02:36.196
hadn't been overseas were being plucked out and 
sent overseas to get combat time. Sure.

02:40.221 --> 02:42.664
Why didn't they pluck you and send you off? Well, I 
don't know. I was one of these individuals. Every

02:45.027 --> 02:51.315
time the training command got a directive to 
increase their training program. They always say

02:55.128 --> 03:04.138
they could do it provided this group of officers 
was retained in the training command. And I was in

03:04.799 --> 03:16.771
that group that I was always on a list to go 
overseas, but never could go overseas because

03:04.799 --> 03:16.771
you're always increasing the training program. 
Sure. And when you went on, you were instructed not

03:17.933 --> 03:21.737
to fly on combat missions. Yeah. So when I went over 
that three-month break, you couldn't even fly on a

03:22.244 --> 03:29.175
combat mission because so many of them were 
getting shot down. Exactly. One last question

03:32.239 --> 03:34.703
before lunchtime. You didn't see combat during 
the Second World War. Well, I guess two questions.

03:42.415 --> 03:45.560
One, do you think that had an effect on your career? 
And two, were you disappointed? Well, I was

03:49.045 --> 03:50.327
disappointed. I don't think it had much to do with 
your career. General Yowd, I was always chewing at

03:56.880 --> 04:02.087
the bet to get overseas. You wrote letters to him. 
General Yowd, who commanded the training

04:06.592 --> 04:15.724
command, he would always talk to him and say, the 
tanks are not going to make any difference

04:06.592 --> 04:15.724
whatsoever when this thing is over.

04:19.855 --> 04:22.959
And General Arnold said not to ask anymore. Yeah,

04:23.259 --> 04:30.789
because he said you were too valuable as to what you 
were doing.

04:34.294 --> 04:49.153
But anyway, I got to Okinawa after the war was over, 
or about the time the war was over, and I went into

04:34.294 --> 04:49.153
Japan on September 11, 1945, which is only a few 
days after the surrender. But it must have been

04:50.281 --> 04:59.053
sort of disappointing for a career man not to be 
able to, a career military man, not to see the

04:50.281 --> 04:59.053
actual combat. Well. He's forgotten how 
disappointing it was. When he was sent off to

05:04.341 --> 05:12.132
England, you know, before we put in radar, he came 
back and put in the radar, the first radar, excuse

05:04.341 --> 05:12.132
me, did you tell him that? Yeah, we did. That's when 
they told me not to go on any combat missions

05:12.612 --> 05:17.099
because she had all the secrets and then he wanted 
to shut down. Yeah. Radar was, of course, a great

05:19.019 --> 05:28.189
technical advance during the Second World War, 
something that the Germans and the Japanese never

05:19.019 --> 05:28.189
got a hold of. Was there a lot of security on the 
base, a lot of top secret? Oh, yeah. You had fences

05:36.398 --> 05:39.482
around all the buildings. We wanted to go, but 
there were a lot of them that didn't get to go, just

05:40.463 --> 05:46.950
to get back around. And you had guards on the gates, 
and you had passers, and that type of thing. It was

05:55.796 --> 05:56.837
real interesting. I mean, it was fascinating, 
really. While at Boca Raton,

06:00.843 --> 06:18.068
I flew the B-17, and then I became a real proficient 
radar bomber, blind bomber. on the Keys out in the

06:18.824 --> 06:20.707
Bahamas. And that's where we were. And you had a lot 
of, you sent students out, a lot of operations out

06:23.070 --> 06:27.275
there for radar bombing? Yeah, well, see, we had, 
all I would say maybe 25 bombers, either B-17s or

06:27.295 --> 06:37.049
B-24s. And we taught the bombardiers how to 
operate the equipment. And when they would give

06:45.039 --> 06:47.042
up, I'd go down and and work on the set, see if I could 
get it working. Because you get out to the Bahamas,

06:51.214 --> 06:55.679
you're, whatever it is, an hour and a half, two 
hours out there. And I got in a lot of radar bombing

06:56.761 --> 07:05.691
myself, so it became a very, and I flew twice a week 
on one of those planes. So you got your flight time

07:05.711 --> 07:06.833
up. Yeah, well in fact I got more time in the B-17 in 
one year that I flew.

07:17.600 --> 07:19.784
at the same to me, around 300 hours. Okay,

07:19.824 --> 07:27.418
let's stop and we'll talk about your post-war 
career. Okay, this is a continuation of our

07:29.361 --> 07:39.439
interviews, and we were talking a couple of hours 
ago about your role during the Second World War as

07:40.060 --> 07:50.210
director of first the Radio Technical School in 
South Dakota and then the Radar Technical School

07:40.060 --> 07:50.210
down in Florida.

07:53.112 --> 08:05.564
I noticed that you were awarded the Legion of Merit 
Medal for outstanding leadership,

07:53.112 --> 08:05.564
organizational ability, and exceptionally 
notorious conduct in the performance of

07:53.112 --> 08:05.564
outstanding services. Tell me about that. I think 
I've already told you all about it. Organizing

08:11.442 --> 08:17.588
the school at Sioux Falls, South Dakota. Right. It 
was because of that. It was because of the

08:19.590 --> 08:20.751
organization. And your radar school at Boca 
Raton, Florida. And then of course establishing

08:25.476 --> 08:31.122
the various technical schools while I was at 
Scott. Okay. Let's continue then with your

08:34.565 --> 08:37.168
military career. You went to Okinawa, or out to 
Japan in 1945 as subordinate commander and staff

08:37.722 --> 08:47.795
executive of the 5th Air Force. You were there 
during the McCarthy years then.

08:55.945 --> 08:57.968
Can you tell me about General MacArthur? Well I 
admired the individual. He's a very, was a very I

09:04.840 --> 09:08.904
don't think that anyone else could have done the 
same job in Japan that he did. They idolized the

09:10.325 --> 09:24.580
emperor and so they idolized him. In fact the 
Japanese I think just stole the show from us. What

09:30.706 --> 09:33.008
do you mean? they, we'd probably, I don't know, 
probably Americans if we'd been occupied, why

09:33.680 --> 09:48.956
we'd probably,

09:33.680 --> 09:48.956
we'd probably have bombed everybody or shoot 
them, snipers, what have you. Well the Japanese

09:48.976 --> 09:58.346
decided that, that

09:48.976 --> 09:58.346
well Americans must have something. So they 
decided to to see what we had, and they copied

10:02.435 --> 10:06.360
everything we had. And this is quality control 
now. Come in. You were saying that MacArthur was

10:15.090 --> 10:22.239
the only one who could take care of that situation. 
Well, I think that MacArthur was... Well, I'd say

10:30.278 --> 10:39.169
egotistical enough to just fall into the Japanese 
pattern. And the command, do you mean? Yeah, as a

10:42.634 --> 10:44.616
command. And his headquarters, why every day that 
he was normally left at a certain time, the

10:44.737 --> 10:56.832
Japanese would line the streets just to take a look 
at him. Really? Yeah. And I think the Japanese

10:58.443 --> 11:08.487
figured that the Americans, to win the war over 
there, must have something. So they're great

11:08.507 --> 11:11.194
copiers. Oh, they sure are. And I'm sure that they 
recognize that they're Up until that time, I

11:18.828 --> 11:24.177
always considered Japanese products as junk. And 
they produced the best cameras. They produced the

11:26.901 --> 11:29.525
best TVs. They produced the best automobiles. I 
mean, their quality control is just outstanding,

11:32.129 --> 11:37.498
it seems to me. And of course, I spent four years in 
Japan. Was MacArthur at that time your commanding

11:46.100 --> 11:51.268
officer then? No, I was way down the line. I started 
out to be in 5th Bomber Command where General Crabb

11:54.452 --> 12:09.935
was, Jimmy Crabb was the commander and then I moved 
to headquarters 5th Air Force and General Wolf was

11:54.452 --> 12:09.935
the commander. Now he was 5th Air Force and then you 
had the Far East Air Forces that was commanded by a

12:12.170 --> 12:23.730
lieutenant general, whereas 5th Air Force was a 
major general.

12:25.814 --> 12:35.511
I was on the staff of 5th Air Force and then later I 
got a command of 315th Air Division.

12:36.655 --> 12:39.339
Did you have an opportunity to meet General 
MacArthur? Oh, yeah. Oh, yeah. In staff meetings,

12:40.720 --> 12:42.563
things like that? No, no. How? No, well, mostly 
when you were on the staff, you were presenting

12:43.824 --> 12:56.641
plans of some sort to General MacArthur and his 
staff.

12:59.645 --> 13:03.611
But he never inspected any of the bases at which I 
was located. Most of it is more of a headquarters

13:03.651 --> 13:06.274
type of thing. And

13:07.688 --> 13:14.918
I was trying to think of other occasions. Most of 
the other occasions were

13:14.998 --> 13:35.367
social occasions, you know, where you attended 
something that you were invited to as a senior

13:14.998 --> 13:35.367
officer in the occupation forces. What did other 
officers think of him?

13:41.713 --> 13:44.317
Was there a general feeling? Well, I think that 
there was always a general feeling of either you

13:44.337 --> 13:53.912
were for MacArthur or you were against MacArthur. 
He was a controversial type of individual where

13:54.593 --> 14:03.447
he was always when you landed on Okinawa, he was out 
there having his picture taken waving shore or

14:04.844 --> 14:16.402
something of this sort. And I think the other thing 
that MacArthur, I think he had his wife with him

14:16.582 --> 14:25.716
almost all the time. And of course everybody

14:26.918 --> 14:32.286
resented that type If he had his wife with him, why 
couldn't everybody else have their wife with

14:33.869 --> 14:44.959
them? What kind of relations did the occupation 
army have with the Japanese people? Well, to start

14:50.905 --> 14:54.027
with, you had practically no relations at all. 
When we first went in there, you had this little

14:54.067 --> 15:01.294
parrot type of dictionary that you

15:02.067 --> 15:09.015
thumb through and try to get your directions. And 
of course they were afraid of you. I mean when you

15:13.801 --> 15:20.488
stopped to ask a question they would head off 
across the rice paddies.

15:21.910 --> 15:29.779
And of course they were, we went into one of the 
bases there. We went in first to a big Japanese

15:31.171 --> 15:37.980
school and took that over. Then we had a lot of 
Japanese workers working on base to clean it up and

15:38.481 --> 15:50.196
build the mess halls and this type of thing. For 
your own troops? For your own troops. You were

15:53.800 --> 15:56.804
building a military base then, right? Oh yeah. And 
a training school, a technical school. And then

16:00.273 --> 16:25.737
later on we moved up to Johnson and then all the 
experienced people who were there were rotated to

16:00.273 --> 16:25.737
the states and we got in a whole division of 
infantry and they were transferred to the Air

16:00.273 --> 16:25.737
Force and you just, they were riflemen and so you 
had a bunch of warm bodies and you had to going to

16:26.476 --> 16:31.601
change them over into airplane mechanics and this 
type of thing. So again, we established some of the

16:31.641 --> 16:37.707
same people I had in the technical schools. I went 
through the records at the Far East Air Forces and

16:39.189 --> 16:56.466
located some of my instructors and technical 
officers that were in the technical schools back

16:39.189 --> 16:56.466
in the States, picked them up, and we technical 
school. We of course had lots of airplanes. They

17:02.324 --> 17:18.201
were just destroying airplanes, American 
airplanes, brand new, crushing them up and

17:02.324 --> 17:18.201
dumping them at sea because you just didn't have 
any place to keep them. Nor did you have any need for

17:18.942 --> 17:21.004
them. So we got all kinds of airplanes, all kinds of 
engines, everything we needed as far as mock-ups

17:26.652 --> 17:31.017
are concerned, but these people work on them, so it 
worked out pretty well. I was also wondering about

17:32.999 --> 17:40.747
your feelings on dropping the atomic bomb. As far 
as I was concerned, it was the right thing to do. I

17:43.029 --> 17:53.040
mean, when you get into a situation like that, it's 
either us or them. If you say, okay, we're not going

17:56.065 --> 18:05.179
drop the atomic bomb and you lose 100,000 American 
soldiers occupying Japan. It would have cost us

18:05.279 --> 18:13.332
dearly because everything underground was just 
like a beehive. It's just like when we went into

18:13.813 --> 18:17.078
Okinawa. of all kinds of caves. They were dug in. 
They were dug in. They were ready for it. As far as I

18:24.455 --> 18:30.784
was concerned, I

18:24.455 --> 18:30.784
feel like that's the right thing to do. You can't 
look back. Did you have an opportunity to travel

18:32.426 --> 18:35.510
much in the country? Did you get down to Nagasaki or 
Hiroshima? Yeah, I visited both Nagasaki and

18:37.753 --> 18:42.800
Hiroshima. What did you see? It was about like all 
the pictures that you see. It was sometime after

18:49.862 --> 19:05.822
when I

18:49.862 --> 19:05.822
got down to Nagasaki and it had a zero, it had a stake 
of some sort, sign or something where the zero

18:49.862 --> 19:05.822
point where the bomb actually hit. And they just 
cleaned everything up. I mean they just leveled

19:09.167 --> 19:13.272
everything.

19:14.045 --> 19:22.319
The firebombing did just as bad a damage, not the 
Okinawa, but all the cities. The napalm bombing

19:23.340 --> 19:32.255
made by the B-29s,

19:23.340 --> 19:32.255
they gutted every city. They certainly did, yeah. 
Killed more than the atomic bombs. That's right.

19:39.712 --> 19:54.150
And you'd drive down the streets of almost any city 
in Japan, and tin and everything else was stacked

19:39.712 --> 19:54.150
up on the sidewalks, and you just had this one 
little alley to drive down the street.

19:59.436 --> 20:08.908
So we did a good, I mean, the Air Force did a real good 
job, as far as saving American lives is concerned.

20:09.057 --> 20:11.019
No question about that. Also during this time that 
you were in Japan, 45 to 49,

20:11.820 --> 20:25.156
the Air Force became an independent organization 
shifting out of the United States Army. What were

20:25.977 --> 20:28.340
your feelings on that as a West Point graduate?

20:31.003 --> 20:31.664
Well, I don't know. I thought it was all right. I 
jumped from a permanent captain to a permanent

20:34.087 --> 20:38.372
colonel. when I transferred. Couldn't beat that. 
Couldn't beat that at all. And I was a temporary

20:48.926 --> 20:53.815
colonel, so I went to a permanent colonel. And then 
I was on a board interviewing all the

21:03.344 --> 21:11.837
Air Corps people and the Army people who wanted to 
transfer to the Air Force as a selection board. And

21:12.898 --> 21:16.664
so we interviewed a lot of people who wanted to 
transfer. If you didn't want to transfer, you'd go

21:16.704 --> 21:20.270
back to the Army. You didn't have to transfer to the 
Air Force. In other words, enlisted men? No,

21:26.579 --> 21:28.542
officers, mostly officers. officers who were in 
the United States Army, but who had Air Force

21:29.298 --> 21:35.746
related jobs? Jobs are, if you didn't have Air 
Force related jobs. Oh, they just wanted to get

21:38.429 --> 21:41.433
into the Air Force. Why is that? Because 
promotions were obviously going to be good? Well,

21:44.817 --> 21:52.967
I don't know, maybe some of them felt that the Air 
Force was much like the Navy. I mean, they always

21:52.987 --> 21:59.035
had a better living than the infantrymen in the 
trenches. But most of them were doctors who didn't

21:59.133 --> 22:10.930
make any difference whether or not you were in the 
Army or the Air Force. Ordinance specialists

22:10.950 --> 22:16.377
that both of us required. And personnel, 
administration, any of those. And then, of

22:24.462 --> 22:32.692
course, some of the non-rated people wanted to 
become rated, and they were also transferred into

22:24.462 --> 22:32.692
the Air Force. So what did you look for on the board? 
I mean, what qualities did you look for?

22:39.961 --> 22:43.485
What kind of man did you want to be an Air Force 
officer? Well, the first thing you look at is their

22:46.048 --> 22:50.634
shoes. I mean, you look at their personal 
appearance. And it was amazing at the time that

22:53.791 --> 23:11.414
some people would come before a board in

22:53.791 --> 23:11.414
combat boots that had mud all over them and things 
of that sort. And the guy was dressed up who was

23:12.495 --> 23:17.942
looking sharp who answered our and all you were 
trying to do is get them to talk. You really didn't

23:22.279 --> 23:25.061
have any specific questions. What you wanted to 
know is how they expressed themselves and

23:25.081 --> 23:47.103
they were, I don't know, I can't remember a couple 
of pointed questions that we'd ask them, but most

23:25.081 --> 23:47.103
of it was just a matter of getting them to express 
themselves, what their objective was in an Air

23:25.081 --> 23:47.103
Force career and

23:25.081 --> 23:47.103
how they looked. If they dressed up, cleanly 
shaven, hair cut, shoes shined,

23:48.635 --> 24:03.489
and under the conditions over there, a reasonably 
pressed pair of pants, you normally accepted

23:48.635 --> 24:03.489
them. And you accepted, I'd say you probably 
accepted 75%.

24:10.295 --> 24:17.342
Was there a lot of, during this time when the Air 
Force was breaking away from the Army, was there a

24:10.295 --> 24:17.342
lot of inter-service rivalry? Do you remember any 
incidents of that? No, I don't.

24:28.997 --> 24:47.194
I don't always think of an

24:28.997 --> 24:47.194
incident where the Army, when I commanded the 
315th Air Division, my division commander's wife

24:28.997 --> 24:47.194
was at the commissary and my wife was standing in 
line to check out while she waltzes right through

24:47.528 --> 24:59.602
ahead of everybody and apparently the guy on the 
check out counter says, well that's Mrs.

24:47.528 --> 24:59.602
Hetherington back there. She's the wife of the 
3853rd Division Commander and apparently Mrs.

25:01.865 --> 25:12.557
Blanchard. I said, well, I don't care. But that's 
about the only instance I can remember. But

25:19.528 --> 25:37.463
no, I mean, you had,

25:19.528 --> 25:37.463
there wasn't really, as far as I was concerned, 
there really wasn't a lot of, and you really didn't

25:19.528 --> 25:37.463
have that much contact with them. Because you 
played them, each division had their own football

25:37.483 --> 25:42.207
team. Sure. and you played them, so there's a lot of 
rivalry as far as football was concerned, but

25:43.098 --> 26:03.504
there's a lot of rivalry between this Army 
division and another one, the 8th Cavalry and

25:43.098 --> 26:03.504
somebody else. But in the colonel ranks of Army 
people or Navy people over there, people got

26:05.567 --> 26:12.396
along. Oh yeah, see everybody was promoted. Like 
in my class of 33, everybody was promoted at the

26:17.513 --> 26:23.348
same time. I was promoted to first lieutenant and 
then I was promoted to captain. All my classmates

26:27.137 --> 26:30.165
were promoted to captain at the same time. and same 
thing the Majors, same thing the Lieutenant

26:30.550 --> 26:33.653
Colonel. And then after that it was a selection 
process whether or not you were overseas in combat

26:34.414 --> 26:50.671
where your chances of getting promoted head kind 
of a field promotion was greater than you were if

26:34.414 --> 26:50.671
you were working back in the States. But

26:50.771 --> 26:59.460
about every six months I got promoted.

27:00.689 --> 27:04.654
There was another aspect during the Truman 
administration. Not only did he take the Air Force

27:04.694 --> 27:20.193
and change the Department of Defense, or 
establish the Department of Defense, but also he

27:04.694 --> 27:20.193
had an executive order in 1948 that integrated the 
services. Do you remember if that had any, do you

27:21.475 --> 27:28.283
remember when the first Air Force units when you 
were in Japan were integrated?

27:31.418 --> 27:56.126
No, we didn't have,

27:31.418 --> 27:56.126
it just wasn't that many colored troops that were 
available to, to,

27:31.418 --> 27:56.126
in fact I don't,

27:31.418 --> 27:56.126
I don't, I don't think we had to pop it off. I mean I 
don't, I don't think we got a single colored pilot

27:59.077 --> 28:05.507
or what have you. It took, well I'll say it, when I 
commanded Massawa a long time later, why did you

28:06.809 --> 28:23.835
have a really integrated command?

28:25.587 --> 28:34.960
And I would say after graduating from the Air War 
College and commanding the security service, you

28:25.587 --> 28:34.960
had a few colored troops, but not very many. So you 
didn't get any... It really wasn't a problem.

28:37.884 --> 28:39.165
Okay, okay. Now let's talk about your command of 
the 315th Wing. What were your functions and

28:46.936 --> 28:49.900
duties there? Well, I had... I think about four 
bases underneath me. I had a 38th bomb wing and I had

29:00.638 --> 29:19.050
an 8th fighter group and I had an air command, an 
ACNW outfit, that's the air command and warning

29:00.638 --> 29:19.050
system.

29:24.110 --> 29:33.001
I would say the biggest problem I had there was that 
I was junior to a lot of colonels. You mean you were a

29:33.242 --> 29:35.645
lieutenant colonel? No, I was junior in grade as 
far as seniority was concerned. And

29:42.934 --> 29:53.948
those guys, I figured they gave me trouble all the 
time. Oh, they did? Well, they didn't really

29:54.818 --> 30:02.888
support you like they would have if they'd been 
junior to you. So other commanders of other wings,

30:04.290 --> 30:22.332
then, in other words, the relationship between 
you and other commanders wasn't very good because

30:04.290 --> 30:22.332
they received— Well, I commanded 315th, and then I 
had the

30:04.290 --> 30:22.332
commander of Inazuki Base. was senior to me and the

30:23.189 --> 30:32.878
commander of the 38th bomb group was senior to me. 
And then the 8th fire group commander was junior to

30:35.081 --> 30:40.366
me. And I think I had three colonels that were 
commanders. And I was designated commander by the

30:46.091 --> 30:51.897
election of the president. And of course, I think 
your biggest problem in those conditions is

30:53.378 --> 31:07.713
trying to be a nice guy rather than really clamping 
down. And

31:07.773 --> 31:22.508
either insisting that they do what you want them 
to, and want it done, and want things done, or quit.

31:25.171 --> 31:30.675
One of them got to drinking too much.
