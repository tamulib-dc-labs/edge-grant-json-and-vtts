I remember how my childhood floated by. I only wish 
that I knew that poem that Miss Kenny said one

00:13.626 --> 00:21.779
children's day. Backward turn, backward, old 
time of your flight. Make me a child just for

00:26.267 --> 00:29.873
tonight. I'd like so very much to remember and 
recall Many of the happy hours of my childhood life

00:35.097 --> 00:41.606
spent along the mighty Perth and Alice. To some 
people, it is just a trickle of water flowing down

00:42.888 --> 00:49.857
through the peaceful hills. But to me and to others 
who live on it, it has been a revealing pleasure of

00:51.039 --> 01:01.273
life and nature. in its best and its worst. The most 
pleasant hours of my life have been spent along

01:08.537 --> 01:16.785
this river. And I enjoy it. It would be nice to say 
that when my day's work is done and I've met the call

01:19.848 --> 01:30.838
from the other side, I would be permitted to put my 
feet down on the banks of the Perdomales.

01:44.302 --> 01:55.915
I was born in 1905,

01:44.302 --> 01:55.915
about a mile from where Lyndon was born. in much the 
same structure house. The only difference in our

01:59.989 --> 02:15.888
house in Linden's, we had boxed up, or my father 
did, an end on the front porch and he had also boxed

01:59.989 --> 02:15.888
up the end on the north porch. The end on the north 
porch is where my mother would do her washing and it

02:17.049 --> 02:22.155
was a a pantry like things we kept our canned foods 
our dirty clothes basket and our washing tub and

02:23.300 --> 02:49.560
rug board and my mother used to soak her clothes at 
night in the tub in order that they wouldn't be so

02:23.300 --> 02:49.560
hard to wash the next day she'd always soak them 
overnight and then there's where she would in this

02:23.300 --> 02:49.560
little shed rooms where she soaked And the little 
shed room out on the south porch was where my Uncle

02:50.283 --> 02:57.473
Jesse would always sleep. He was a veteran of the 
Civil War, and he had a wooden leg. He was a very

03:02.900 --> 03:06.024
accomplished musician. And I can look back now and 
remember the beautiful stories that he would

03:07.106 --> 03:14.215
tell. me of his childhood in georgia and then as he 
came to alabama and then on to texas i only wish that

03:14.718 --> 03:43.695
i had been a little more patient and listened a 
little closer but children don't think of those

03:14.718 --> 03:43.695
things at that time if it's something that 
interests them they'll listen if it isn't they're

03:14.718 --> 03:43.695
up and gone but black people always did intrigued 
me and he would tell me about how they would go out in

03:44.435 --> 04:06.308
the cane patch and how they would sing and how he 
enjoyed singing with them and working with them

03:44.435 --> 04:06.308
and he said they were the best cooks in the world and 
I believe he must be right because they are good

03:44.435 --> 04:06.308
cooks.

04:08.296 --> 04:12.664
I enjoyed every minute of my time with Uncle Jesse. 
Of course, I know I was quite a little, well, scamp,

04:12.704 --> 04:21.339
as he called me one time. I didn't know what scamp 
was, but my mother explained it to me. But I would,

04:25.646 --> 04:32.498
my father had an old A colleague of mine by the name 
of Tim McConaughey stayed and worked with us a lot

04:32.967 --> 04:39.016
of time. And Tim says, now that Uncle Jesse stomps 
that wooden leg, gets at you and runs you through

04:39.036 --> 04:48.109
this house, you just start singing. Donna's got a 
wooden leg laid away. Donna's got a meat skin laid

04:52.675 --> 04:55.339
away. Greaves that wooden leg twice a day. And it 
had several verses to it. It said, you'll get him

05:01.883 --> 05:04.067
stopped. He won't teach you anymore. But that 
didn't work. Uncle Jesse would stomp that one leg

05:08.496 --> 05:12.824
and start out after me. And I'll tell you, I made 
tracks down that trail. I didn't waste any time.

05:21.652 --> 05:24.075
But it was a pleasure of an afternoon. We'd always 
have to go down and let the cow in from the pasture,

05:24.135 --> 05:32.046
which is about 200 yards from the house down a 
trail. And oh, I don't know, seemed like the

05:32.166 --> 05:37.012
flowers then were so much brighter. The colors 
were so much prettier. And they were just

05:42.199 --> 05:44.983
naturally larger, seems to me. I'm sure they were 
not, but that's the way it seems. he would stop and

05:50.221 --> 06:12.077
tell me the name of every flower that we pass and 
he'd explain it to me and and you know that takes a

05:50.221 --> 06:12.077
lot of patience to fool with a kid like that but i but 
i learned to love flowers i learned to appreciate

05:50.221 --> 06:12.077
them
