WEBVTT

00:01.769 --> 00:04.175
Okay, now, your name is Augustine? Augustine C. 
Garcia. Augustine C. Garcia. Yeah, always I say C,

00:08.165 --> 00:14.300
but my whole name is always C. Okay.

00:14.881 --> 00:15.643
Okay.

00:22.103 --> 00:24.587
Okay, we're here on Highway 79 East. Right, east of 
Rockdale. What, about one mile east of Rockdale? A

00:28.414 --> 00:30.237
mile and a half, they call it. That's what my car 
raced, the speedometer. Okay. Yeah, one and a half

00:34.124 --> 00:36.749
miles. Right, and it's about ten minutes to three 
in the afternoon. I guess it is. Okay, all right.

00:42.419 --> 00:44.402
Now, may I call you Augustine? Sure, yeah, sure. 
All right. Did you grow up in the United States, or

00:46.353 --> 00:50.739
were you born somewhere else? I was born in Travis 
County. Travis County. In Austin, Texas. No

00:54.544 --> 00:55.786
kidding. Right. And how did you get to Rockville? 
Well, you know, before up in them days, there was

00:59.071 --> 01:03.657
traveling, you know, working. He was working on 
farms. And we moved out here to San Diego, they tell

01:07.182 --> 01:13.170
me, when I was about seven years old. from Bastrop, 
San Diego, San Diego, they were just starting the

01:14.635 --> 01:22.105
lignite works around here. And he never did work in 
coal, but my grandfather was an old coal miner.

01:28.233 --> 01:35.703
Well, not really a coal miner, he was from Mexico in 
them gold mines and silver mines. But that still

01:36.304 --> 01:38.106
was in the ground. And he came here, he went to work 
this coal mine, lignite. So he kind of I dragged my

01:45.517 --> 01:47.380
daddy back this way. I see. And that's how we came 
here. Do you remember what year you came to

01:50.464 --> 01:53.028
Rockdale? No, I was seven years old. I'm 90. You're 
90 today? No, not today. I will be 98 if I live. Oh,

02:01.300 --> 02:01.861
you will. 28th of August, you'll be 98. That's 
right. I was born 1887. Okay. The 28th day of

02:07.670 --> 02:09.813
August. All right. And you came to Rockdale when 
you were seven years old? Yes, about seven. I don't

02:14.639 --> 02:18.505
know exactly, but I remember when we came here. Do 
you remember how old you were before you started

02:19.467 --> 02:25.296
mining yourself? Yes, my father died when I was 15 
years old, and I became the head of the family then.

02:31.325 --> 02:38.676
I had to go to work and see two sisters and two 
brothers, and I was the oldest one. So you had to go

02:39.618 --> 02:41.521
to work in the mines with your dad? I had to go to work 
to make a living for my mother. In those days, the

02:44.365 --> 02:47.809
ladies didn't work like they do today. I see. All 
the work was in the kitchen, in the house. And so I

02:53.898 --> 03:01.909
had to get up and ball the jacks to make a living for 
five, six hours. My goodness. My mother had to sign

03:04.092 --> 03:08.578
up some kind of a paper so they would let me go to 
work. They didn't want me. I wasn't allowed to go 15

03:10.693 --> 03:13.776
years of age. You were too young to work without. 
But my mother signed some kind of papers and then

03:15.898 --> 03:20.122
they let me go to work. That's why I lost my leg. You 
lost your leg? Yeah, I got artificial leg. I see. I

03:26.387 --> 03:28.369
lost it when I was 18 years old. And you lost it while 
you were down in one of the mines? Yes, sir. Right

03:31.472 --> 03:33.533
across back over there. Vogel's mine. Vogel's 
mine? Vogel's. I see. I used to be Vogel's over

03:37.177 --> 03:38.818
there. The side of my house is up here, this side of 
the railroad, them days. I see. Well, how, if you

03:46.419 --> 03:50.663
can remember, how did the accident occur? My late? 
Yes, sir. Well, I was digging coal at that time, and

03:53.346 --> 04:06.499
I walked to the, what they call entrance, you know, 
they had a main entrance. Right. And they had rooms

04:07.385 --> 04:12.329
turned off from this entrance where the man was 
digging. And I got out of my room and I got on. The

04:15.952 --> 04:19.075
driver wasn't going to take my car. I had a little 
coal mine car, you know. We loaded it and then if we

04:22.758 --> 04:26.922
loaded it, they had a man to drive a mule. He'd come 
and he'd pull the car from it. And they'd bring you

04:30.264 --> 04:31.726
an empty one. Well, I filled out my car and I dug a big 
pile of coal and The driver didn't come, so I

04:37.186 --> 04:42.711
started to go out to the main entrance, see what 
happened. And when I did, a big rock fell on me. A big

04:46.075 --> 04:47.116
rock fell on you? Yes, a sand rock. A big sand rock 
fell on my back and knocked me down. And I remember

04:54.903 --> 04:58.847
that I had an awful heavy load on me. I was trying to 
raise myself, but I couldn't. Then I passed out.

05:03.252 --> 05:04.313
Now they know nothing. They dug me out. They said 
when they come and see the pile of dirt and the rock

05:06.160 --> 05:16.932
and there was a pile of dirt on top of it and they see 
my shoes, my heels or something. Said somebody's

05:17.412 --> 05:18.914
under here. They start digging and find my legs and 
find it. They do it. Said it's Augustine. And they

05:26.162 --> 05:27.143
drove me out. I didn't do it. Because you were still 
passed out. Yeah, I was still passed out. And they

05:31.608 --> 05:36.133
drove me out to a place that had more air, I guess. 
And then I come into myself, and man, they couldn't

05:36.738 --> 05:40.943
touch me nowhere. I was hurt all over. But I come to 
myself, and then they put me in a sheet and brought

05:43.846 --> 05:48.391
me home. Took you to your home? Yes, they brought me 
out, put me on a cage that's sort of like an

05:50.754 --> 05:55.439
elevator, you know? Right. And they hushed me out, 
and then they took me to my house. We was living, all

06:00.365 --> 06:02.948
the captain was, I bet it was a hundred houses just 
outside of Red Road. That was Morgan County.

06:09.901 --> 06:10.201
Uh-huh. It's Morgan. And they brought me home, and 
the doctor didn't have the hospital then. Right.

06:19.974 --> 06:21.536
But we had a company doctor. Company doctor. 
Company doctor, Dr. Rob Wallace. Rob Wallace?

06:26.323 --> 06:27.064
Yeah, Dr. Rob Wallace. Okay. Used to be three 
brothers, Rob, Daddy Wallace. Dr. Bob Wallace, a

06:31.784 --> 06:33.907
little bit of fella. And then Dr. Doug Wallace, and 
then Dr. Rob Wallace. Three Wallace's.

06:43.200 --> 06:46.144
And... Did they lay you on a cot in your room? After I 
got home? Right. Yes, they laid me on the bed, I

06:48.267 --> 06:50.270
guess. Layed on my bed, on my cot, I guess. And then 
the doctors came and they... They put, they didn't

06:59.645 --> 07:04.010
have this stuff that they use now. They had this 
little bowl, this plate as they call it. And then

07:07.914 --> 07:12.759
they put those plates on there and held it there for 
so many days. And it didn't grow together. So the

07:16.082 --> 07:21.308
doctor said, I was going to lose my leg if it didn't 
take it off there. It was turning black or

07:22.008 --> 07:24.311
something. And my mother got scared, you know, and 
my older sister. Says, no, well, take your leg off.

07:31.554 --> 07:33.997
I said, no, I'm going to die or let me die. No, they 
won't. They wouldn't let me. So they took my leg

07:37.481 --> 07:43.968
off, four and a half inches below my kneecap, right 
along here. They took my... The company doctor did

07:45.450 --> 07:48.013
that? Yeah. Even Dr. Bob, I mean, Dr. Dunkwallis, 
you see? Four and a half inches from here, my leg is

07:53.819 --> 07:57.023
off right along there. So you, did you have to pay 
for the medical attention or did vocal mining have

07:58.876 --> 08:07.287
to pay for it? I had to sue him. Oh, you sued him? I had 
to sue him, yeah. They wouldn't come across. They

08:12.414 --> 08:14.877
wanted me to vacate the house. Wanted me and my 
mother to get out the house because I wasn't able to

08:15.859 --> 08:21.707
pay the rent. So you took him to court then? So I went 
and got me a lawyer. But I did. Well, I got no sense

08:29.185 --> 08:33.972
now, but then as a kid, you know how it is. No 
experience or nothing. So that lawyer got me. He

08:36.856 --> 08:39.039
got more than I got. But... The lawyer got more 
money than you. Oh, yeah. You know, he sold out

08:43.406 --> 08:45.569
himself. I see now what happened. But I couldn't 
see it then. But you did get some money from the

08:50.015 --> 08:52.399
mining company? We got $1,000. $1,000. $1,000 for 
my lake. When I owe the commissary the store, I owe

08:56.614 --> 09:00.377
him $700. Man, that was good enough. Let my mother 
buy food on credit. Right. And when I got through

09:07.765 --> 09:12.470
with him, I paid him $700. So I had about $300 left. 
And I bought my first artificial lake. Them days

09:19.277 --> 09:20.998
didn't cost but $100. Now they cost $400. Yeah. 
Well, then, so what did you do after you got the

09:24.838 --> 09:32.748
money, paid him off, got your artificial lady? You 
didn't mine again, did you? Well, I went to work to

09:34.490 --> 09:38.214
mine again, but I didn't go down into mine. Oh, I 
see. I got the job. I got to learn how to fire, you

09:39.936 --> 09:44.581
know, as a fireman, fire boilers. Fire the 
boilers. Yes. Right. And they're pumping water

09:46.504 --> 09:53.612
out of the mine, so they had to have a man all night 
long to keep steam up. for the pumps to run. And I got

09:55.803 --> 09:57.666
a job firing boilers. I see. What kind of fuel did 
you use? Lignite. You used the lignite. Lignite,

10:01.652 --> 10:02.173
yeah. And how long did you have that job? Oh, I 
guess, I don't know, for nearly a year, I guess, a

10:05.659 --> 10:10.346
month. Then I began to learn how to run engine. Then 
from there, from Wichita, we had to leave Mobile

10:15.918 --> 10:24.831
because they made us get out the house. So we went to 
Wichita. And my mother-in-law, the only thing she

10:26.673 --> 10:33.203
could make out is run a boarded house. She kept 
boarding people, you know, single men. Oh, she

10:35.786 --> 10:36.908
boarded people? Yeah, she boarded people. I see. 
And that's how I got straight up. Then we moved to

10:41.735 --> 10:43.377
Texas. Texas Coal Company mine over here. Oh, you 
did? Uh-huh. And then I went to run the engine,

10:47.439 --> 10:50.943
Houston engine. I was big shot then. Oh. Yeah, I 
could run a Houston engine. So you didn't go down

10:55.308 --> 10:58.252
beneath the ground anymore? Yes, I went, but not 
deep coal no more. I went as a pump man, they called

11:02.137 --> 11:06.442
it, you know. Oh, I see. As a pump man. And then for a 
while, I was a foreman. A foreman? Foreman, yeah, I

11:12.129 --> 11:13.431
was a boss. pit boss, they call it. For a while, not a 
long time, but for a while. When you were running

11:22.731 --> 11:33.408
the hoist, let's start back when you were stoking 
the boiler, how were you paid? I was paid by the

11:34.029 --> 11:35.331
month. By the month, okay. And then when you became 
an engineer, by the month. And then when you were a

11:42.925 --> 11:46.190
foreman, by the month. Do you remember how much you 
were paid per month? Let's see, I was getting, I

11:49.835 --> 11:55.482
don't remember what, we worked 12 hours. I went to 
work six in the morning to six at night, at evening.

12:01.250 --> 12:02.031
And, uh, I don't remember how much I got when I was 
fine, but when I rode the engine, I got $90 a month.

12:09.299 --> 12:11.442
$90 a month for being an engineer. For engineer, 
yeah. That was 12 hours a day. Five days a week? Six

12:16.147 --> 12:17.209
days a week. Six days a week. What about when you 
were a foreman? Same thing. $90 a month? $90, yeah,

12:22.775 --> 12:24.978
the same. I didn't stay long as a foreman. Mr. 
Taylor, Sam Taylor was a foreman. And he had to go to

12:31.019 --> 12:37.886
Houston, bought something, and he left it in his 
place for about a month or so. I didn't stay long.

12:40.769 --> 12:47.356
Then he quit, and they put this woman there, the 
Texas Gold Company, that was Mr. E.B. Phillips.

12:48.297 --> 12:48.657
E.B. Phillips, right. And Mr. St. Kitts, 
Shrivlin, Mr. Shrivlin. Shrivlin? Shrivlin was

12:57.426 --> 12:59.068
the superintendent. And the storekeeper. And 
E.B. Phillips and H.C. Meyer was there. The big,

13:05.906 --> 13:08.871
there was a big shot. There was only place there or 
something. Do you remember what kind of a man E.B.

13:13.359 --> 13:14.020
Phillips was? He was a big-style fellow, and he 
talked and cussed like dickens. Every time he

13:18.684 --> 13:20.527
moved his mouth, he'd cuss. He'd cuss over the 
phone and everywhere, every time. I remember one

13:24.153 --> 13:33.687
time when I was buying the boilers, it was the 
wintertime, and they had a haul of water, and they

13:24.153 --> 13:33.687
had a digger on a wagon with some burners, you know. 
And he got, it was so cold, he didn't want to go after

13:34.388 --> 13:37.593
more water. So I was getting out of water, and I 
called Mr. Phillips, I said, Mr. Phillip, I said,

13:41.557 --> 13:47.284
with my guy, why did the ass run over that goddamn 
nigga? I said, well, it's too cold. He don't want to

13:49.346 --> 13:50.268
get out. I'll be there in a minute. I'll make the 
setup. He's going to wake up. His mouth will move.

13:58.057 --> 13:59.599
Over the phone, he cussed. He didn't care. He was 
that kind of man. He was a good-hearted man, all

14:02.723 --> 14:04.585
right. Good-hearted? Yeah, Mr. Phillip was a good 
man. Yes, sir. How long did you work for the Texas

14:09.451 --> 14:11.293
Colt Company? Oh, I don't know. I worked out many 
years. I would look at the letter that I got from

14:15.712 --> 14:18.275
them, you know. They give me when I quit. They give 
me a big letter, recommendation, you know. I don't

14:24.163 --> 14:25.305
want to work on them. For them, that I was a 
dependable man and all this and that. I got a letter

14:30.993 --> 14:32.335
that's somewhere. Yeah, I'd like to see that later 
on, maybe, if we could. Well, my wife, she can't

14:37.362 --> 14:39.505
hardly get up now. She's in bed. Well, if we can't 
find it, that's all right. But from what I know, the

14:46.168 --> 14:55.376
Texas Coal Company mine started to really phase 
out about the mid-20s, mid-late 20s. Yes. Is that

14:55.937 --> 14:56.397
right? During the war. Or after the war? And after 
the war, yeah. They closed up. Why did they close

15:01.402 --> 15:02.503
up? I don't know. Oh, I think Alcoa put them out of 
business. Well, Alcoa didn't come in until...

15:10.572 --> 15:13.195
1950. So I was just wondering if maybe the 
Depression didn't hurt

15:13.215 --> 15:21.943
coal companies. Do you remember what you did 
during the Depression? Sure. I was already moved

15:24.526 --> 15:26.007
here. I was already had quit. You know, after I quit 
Texas Coal Company, I bought me an automobile that

15:28.109 --> 15:34.335
went to run ginning. I run ginning for about a year 
and a half, for two years. You ran a gin? A ginning? a

15:40.677 --> 15:46.886
service car for about a year and a half. I see. Were 
you able to save money working at the Texas Gold

15:48.048 --> 15:51.933
Company? Not too much, but I saved something. Yes, 
I saved something. I married in 1919.

16:00.165 --> 16:02.368
And I had a little money when I married. Had been 
saving, you know, holding back. Then after I

16:06.854 --> 16:09.418
married, I bought me a car. In 1919, I married in 
1920, I think. This girl was married to my oldest

16:15.641 --> 16:17.663
daughter. She was born in 1920. And that was a brand 
new Ford. Model T or Model A? Model T. Model T. Model

16:27.473 --> 16:31.357
T. They had no Model As yet. They came in a little 
late afterwards. It was Model T. It had courage on

16:33.960 --> 16:37.043
its side. No, no, no glasses, nothing like that. I 
see. No, I had curtains. Curtains? Yeah, and a

16:43.079 --> 16:45.322
cloth top. You know, you could put it back or raise 
it up any way you wanted. So you didn't go back to the

16:50.428 --> 16:52.511
mines after you quit? No, after I quit, I didn't go 
back. I moved here. Then I bought this little place

16:55.154 --> 17:06.608
of land here, an old house that used to be out there, 
right there close to where the fence is now. And

17:07.347 --> 17:09.209
then I went to work for the city. City Water Works. 
At Rockdale. At Rockdale, yeah. That work that I

17:14.215 --> 17:17.819
doing, worked for the city about two, three years. 
Then I quit the city and I went to plumbing by

17:18.520 --> 17:23.545
myself, you know, my own job. I was a plumber. A 
plumber. Plumber until I retired. Well, that

17:28.090 --> 17:29.312
sounds great. If we could go back, you know, to your 
days at the Texas Coal Company, okay, could you

17:29.332 --> 17:36.780
describe a typical day at the mine you know what 
time did you get up in the morning what did you do

17:37.300 --> 18:06.598
well my job was i had to get up i i didn't get up in the 
morning i went to work and i was working at night you

17:37.300 --> 18:06.598
see okay 12 hours i went to work at six in the in the 
evening and and quit six in the morning i see then mr

17:37.300 --> 18:06.598
mr uh summers the old man he come in and take the day 
They called it shifts. I was working that shift and

18:09.457 --> 18:12.601
he was working this shift. They said I was young and 
he was old, man. They let him work. I told him,

18:17.026 --> 18:18.127
that's all right. I could stand the 12 hours of 
work. And I did for years and I don't know how long.

18:24.775 --> 18:27.399
What did you do during your 12-hour shift? Fired 
boilers, keeping the steam up and watching my

18:27.419 --> 18:31.764
pumps. They were on 12 hours all night, keep that 
water on. He pumped the water out of the mine. See,

18:38.226 --> 18:40.008
they had a flood here one time. The water broke in 
the mine and yellow fell up to the top. And they had

18:45.253 --> 18:48.577
to pump water day and night there for a long time. 
Several weeks or? Months. Months? Yes, yes.

18:53.762 --> 18:55.604
Months. And you lived right next to the mines, 
right? Oh, we lived at the camps, you see. The camp

19:00.629 --> 19:02.151
had houses. Oh, I had rows of houses, one here, one 
there, and just, you know, about every 40 feet, one

19:03.397 --> 19:09.966
from the other. Two-room house. Two-room house. 
Yes, one room and a kitchen, little old kitchen,

19:12.950 --> 19:16.295
yes. About as big as my garage size. How many people 
would live in these? Well, some of them had just a

19:21.522 --> 19:32.998
man and a wife, and some of them had two or three 
children, or some of them had four or five kids, and

19:21.522 --> 19:32.998
they all lived in that one room. Yeah. See, when I 
first married, my mother was running a boarding

19:35.055 --> 19:38.880
house. She had a big four-room house. That's a 
boarded house. A boarding house. Yeah, and four

19:45.048 --> 19:45.989
rooms. One room, she kept that for the dining room 
for there. When the men come to eat, that big room,

19:50.315 --> 19:56.703
and three rooms for my sister, she stayed. And 
after I was married, when I move out, then I went and

19:57.605 --> 20:03.272
rent one of those small houses just Me and my wife, 
you know. Right. Do you know, do you remember how

20:05.609 --> 20:10.833
much the company charged you to live in those 
houses? Yes, the small house was $3 a month. $3 a

20:13.295 --> 20:14.276
month. And that big house where my mother lived was 
$6 a month. I see. Yeah. Well, did your mother's

20:20.001 --> 20:23.344
boarding house belong to the mine? Yeah, to the 
company. I see. To the company, yes. What kind of

20:26.026 --> 20:29.389
men would come and board there? Well, working men, 
working, working in the mine, coal diggers. Oh.

20:34.066 --> 20:35.908
Would it be bachelors most of them? Yeah, 
bachelors, sure. Bachelors. They had no wives.

20:40.354 --> 20:41.115
They're bachelors. They're single men, they call 
it. Single men. Single men. Yeah, mother had this

20:45.119 --> 20:49.865
room, this six, I mean, this whole room of house. 
It's a boarded house. Then they covered it with

20:51.487 --> 20:54.771
rent. It's a mortar house. They had carts for them. 
Single men sleep, you know. That's $3 a month. But

21:02.956 --> 21:04.759
mother didn't have to pay for that. Each one of 
them. Mrs. Trevlin, he took charge of that. He

21:10.748 --> 21:15.916
charged everyone, I don't know how much, but 
mother didn't have to do with that. All she had to do

21:16.557 --> 21:20.563
was to make a four-room house. She had to pay rent 
for that. And then, did the men pay her for cooking?

21:27.614 --> 21:28.595
Oh, yes. She charged them for that. I believe it was 
$3 a week. Three hours a week? Yeah, for cooking.

21:37.538 --> 21:42.744
And the grub, not only cooking, but the groceries 
and everything. Yes, served the table. All that

21:43.845 --> 21:46.968
dude sat on the table and ate. She served them three 
meals a day? Three meals a day. Yes, sir. Did they

21:51.193 --> 21:53.395
come up out of the mines for lunch? They usually 
take lunch at dinner time. Very seldom. Very few of

21:58.080 --> 21:59.982
them come out at noon. They go down in the morning. 
didn't come out about started coming out from

22:02.761 --> 22:30.220
three to four o'clock well did your mother fix them 
a supper to take down into the mind at dinner yes

22:02.761 --> 22:30.220
that's bigger lunch she fixed the lunch for them so 
for instance if i say well i'm not coming to dinner

22:02.761 --> 22:30.220
today fix me a lunch please all right mother fixing 
my life and i take my lunch with me so i wouldn't be

22:02.761 --> 22:30.220
she wouldn't expect me to be there at noon Because I 
already took my lunch, you see. Well, if the miners

22:35.481 --> 22:41.667
came out between 3 and 4, what did they do after they 
finished the day of mining? They just sat around

22:41.687 --> 22:44.210
and talked. Sit around and talked. Yeah. What did 
they do on the weekends? Same thing. Same thing?

22:52.519 --> 22:53.440
Same thing. They had a big wash, a bathroom place 
there. right close to the agent house, concrete

22:59.174 --> 23:03.842
floor. They were there going to shoot dice, most of 
them. They spent time shooting dice, playing

23:09.112 --> 23:13.099
poker or some kind of game. But they spent Sundays 
and Saturday nights over there. I see. In the camp.

23:21.674 --> 23:23.157
Would they ever go into Rockville? Oh, yes, they'd 
go on Saturday evenings and buy their beer and

23:23.288 --> 23:28.875
bring it back, or maybe they'd get drunk and down. 
Some of them would drink one in the morning. Mr.

23:31.799 --> 23:34.082
Stribble had to go and pay the fines to get them out. 
They had to come and work it, pay the fine. Was that

23:42.633 --> 23:45.196
fine taken out of their paycheck? Oh, sure. Yeah, 
sure. They had to pay it all. Of course, Mr.

23:50.022 --> 23:52.165
Stribble would give them time to say, For 
instance, if a man had just $15 coming through the

23:52.550 --> 24:05.086
week, and the flight was $20 or $50, he'd take out, 
say, maybe $5 this payday. Next payday, he'd take

24:05.106 --> 24:07.008
another $5. Then he'd pay his pay. Yeah, he'd give 
him a chance. He'd give him a break. Yeah, the other

24:12.835 --> 24:14.397
street was pretty nice. Was there any type of 
musical instruments around the camps at all? No.

24:23.802 --> 24:35.462
No, every now and then, maybe once, maybe some, 
maybe one or two of us used to play horns or violin or

24:23.802 --> 24:35.462
something. They had dances all right. They did? 
Yeah, they had dances about every two, three

24:37.466 --> 24:41.373
Saturday nights. Was that in the camp? In the camp. 
They had a big hall over there. Company made up a big

24:45.761 --> 24:48.185
hall. I see. Was that over at the Vogel Mine? That 
was at Texas Mine. They had a dance hall? They had a

24:53.129 --> 24:55.291
dance hall at Texas Mine.

24:59.816 --> 25:06.944
Do you remember where most of the

24:59.816 --> 25:06.944
miners came from? Oh, they came from all over the 
country, I think. They used to send a man to Laredo

25:09.727 --> 25:16.675
to get some hands, to get some coal diggers. They'd 
bring a bunch of people over there. Sometimes

25:19.676 --> 25:24.444
eight or 10, sometimes three or four, just that 
way. Some of them were families, lots of them were

25:24.864 --> 25:28.831
single, but they'd bring them in. They'd send the 
men, they were down there, to Laredo, or

25:29.932 --> 25:37.144
Salentown, or somewhere, to get some men. Were 
they, had they already been miners in Mexico, or

25:38.356 --> 25:43.341
were they new to New Mexico? No, some of them maybe, 
there was some of them. They'd never seen a mine

25:45.484 --> 25:47.646
before, I don't reckon. But they claimed they was a 
miner.

25:53.613 --> 25:58.398
Did they think that the conditions here were 
better than in New Mexico? I guess so, they liked

25:58.418 --> 25:59.860
it. They liked it here? They liked it here in the 
United States, yeah. They still like it because I

26:05.035 --> 26:08.401
see lots of them white bikes coming this way. They 
still like it. You're a natural citizen because

26:11.446 --> 26:15.272
you were born here. Oh, I was born here, raised 
here, this side of Austin. Yeah, all my life. Yeah,

26:22.664 --> 26:25.770
I was born in Austin, Texas, Travis County. First 
of my life, the week before last. I look at the

26:29.572 --> 26:35.018
captain and I says, I wonder what was that boy, 
somebody lose check again? So far.

26:38.402 --> 26:40.845
That's a long time ago. Long time ago. Did, 
Augustine, do you remember any labor problems at

26:44.109 --> 26:51.137
the Texas Coal Company mine? Were there any 
strikes or any union movements or anything? No,

26:54.621 --> 26:56.203
there ain't no union. No, they had no strikes. 
Well, what if one of the workers got mad at Mr.

26:59.338 --> 27:03.262
Phillips or something? Did he just quit and leave, 
or what did he do? Well, if they get mad, they just

27:06.045 --> 27:11.711
quit that mine and go find a job at the other one. You 
see, there was a world of mine, and here was a

27:11.731 --> 27:27.608
Vogel's right across there, and that was a Texas, 
and that was a big lump far on yonder. There was

27:28.263 --> 27:30.627
four, five shafts. There was hundreds and 
hundreds of coal diggers. So if I did mess with my

27:34.133 --> 27:41.685
boss here or something, I just quit, go with the 
other place, get me a job, and go to work. And maybe

27:42.286 --> 27:45.431
one for over there, come over here, just that way. I 
see. Well, did you work all year long? Huh? Did you

27:49.237 --> 27:50.860
work all the year? Yes, sure, all year long. Yeah, 
we had no vacation then. No vacation. No, sir. You

27:57.451 --> 27:58.853
know what vacation was? No retirement plan, no. 
When you got too old and you couldn't do the job,

28:02.218 --> 28:08.307
it's just like an old mule that turns you loose in 
the pasture. Gone. You can't do no more good while

28:09.809 --> 28:12.914
it's gone. It ain't like now. No, I lost the best 
part of my life. I wish I had the more, but 40 years

28:22.010 --> 28:24.673
later than I was born. Why is that? Because it's 
different now. Whole lot of different than it was

28:27.636 --> 28:30.239
when I was a young man. See, when I was a young man, I 
go to work at 6 in the morning. If I'm one hour late,

28:36.306 --> 28:41.211
they send me home and they wouldn't let me work. And 
if I quit one hour earlier, they took it off my

28:42.593 --> 28:46.617
check. If you wait three hours, you get paid for 
three hours, rain or shine, whether you had the

28:47.761 --> 28:54.487
reason or not. You wait three hours, six days, 
that's all you get paid for. But nowadays, you

28:58.831 --> 29:02.775
start to work, you get full time. And after you get 
so old, that you're 65 years old, you get Social

29:04.917 --> 29:16.047
Security, you get retirement from the railroad, 
all that protection. Well, back yonder when I was a

29:16.263 --> 29:19.727
young man, was nothing like that. When I got a lot of 
good work, they just kicked my butt and gone.

29:24.111 --> 29:24.872
Kicked me out. Said, you're putting out a young man 
in this place. That's the way the combine used to

29:29.097 --> 29:31.860
be. Well, did anybody take care of you then? 
Families or friends? Nobody, nobody. You just

29:37.666 --> 29:39.068
kicked it out on your own? If you had it, you eat it. 
If you didn't have it, you wouldn't eat it. You'd

29:42.491 --> 29:43.232
starve. No, it ain't like it is now, not there. No, 
no. No, back in them days, if you had a piece of

29:51.042 --> 29:54.267
bread, you'd eat it. If you didn't have it, what? 
You just didn't have it? No, it was over. What

29:59.233 --> 30:00.835
happened when somebody got sick? Did the other 
families help out? Yes, we got to take up

30:02.437 --> 30:04.680
collections. We'd go around and say, so-and-so's 
at a badge. How much can you have? Well, a quarter

30:08.806 --> 30:13.472
maybe, half a dollar, or whatever you could. And we 
take a list to the store, to Mr. Stribling, and give

30:13.908 --> 30:19.213
it to him. He says, for instance, I'll go half a 
dollar, all right, Augustine? He says, you go half

30:25.238 --> 30:30.662
a dollar, so-and-so half a dollar, and on and on. We 
give Mr. Stribling the list, and he take it all

30:30.682 --> 30:33.645
right. So that made his wife, or his daughter, to 
come to the store and buy it. If you had $4 worth,

30:39.830 --> 30:42.953
well, you'd get $4 worth of grub. That's why we take 
up collections, you know, to help them. Somebody

30:48.037 --> 30:52.122
die, we take up a collection to pay for the coffin. 
Yeah, you see, while we was in the mine, someone

30:53.783 --> 31:02.012
with a book, piece of paper, the person, oh, 
somebody passed away. So and so died last night.

31:06.857 --> 31:08.559
How much can you put on here to help? Oh, maybe a 
dollar or a dollar and a half, something like that.

31:14.202 --> 31:15.764
Whatever you could, $2. Well, okay. They bring the 
list to Mr. Smith's store. Okay. He said, sit down,

31:23.232 --> 31:27.036
says, let's have a coffee for so much. They got $20 
collected here or $30, $40 or $50, whatever you

31:27.537 --> 31:34.044
want. Let them have it. We got nothing to worry 
about. That's the way it is. But some men got killed

31:39.751 --> 31:43.447
at the mine. They wouldn't give them a penny, not 
even a coffin.
