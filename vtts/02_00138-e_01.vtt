It was authorized in 1943. We were talking about 
major gift. And consultation. Anything else that

00:11.123 --> 00:19.974
is dear to your heart that you wish you had the 
capability to help fund at A&M if you were a rich,

00:11.123 --> 00:19.974
rich, rich person? Well, of course, athletics is 
dear to my heart. And we're going all out on the West

00:25.361 --> 00:30.207
Campus improving those facilities over there. 
And they are sorely needed. And I think the

00:36.266 --> 00:49.103
expansion of the south end zone at Kyle Field and 
all the things that it will do for the athletic

00:36.266 --> 00:49.103
department is a step in the right direction. I 
don't know if it's enough of a step. I'm not that

00:52.468 --> 00:58.636
familiar with all of the moving parts in all of 
that. But...

01:02.772 --> 01:10.181
You know, if you build a 105,000 seat stadium here 
in College Station, are you going to fill it?

01:12.303 --> 01:12.664
Maybe. But it's going to be a while. Okay. There's 
not enough motels and hotels in College Station to

01:18.250 --> 01:22.976
hold that many people. Can you think of anything? 
I've only got one more question, unless you can

01:26.140 --> 01:29.263
think of anything we've left out. You've 
exhausted me already, Haskell. Alright, the last

01:32.455 --> 01:33.576
question. What feelings do you hold in your heart 
for Texas A&M today?

01:50.873 --> 01:52.094
I bleed rude.

01:55.117 --> 01:59.321
I do.

01:59.341 --> 02:01.703
I feel strongly. about Texas A&M as I do about my 
family.

02:09.191 --> 02:14.818
Because it is my family. I was practically raised 
here for four years of my life. And all the ties that

02:20.104 --> 02:30.778
I have to Texas A&M, which is one of the primary 
reasons why we moved back here a year ago. We had

02:31.889 --> 02:34.272
lived in Austin for 23 years. And my wife came in one 
day after having battled that traffic in Austin.

02:41.022 --> 02:43.766
Austin was getting more and more uncivil. And she 
said, just came in off the street after she had

02:45.568 --> 02:53.440
nearly been rear-ended twice on Ben White 
Boulevard. She said, have you ever thought about

02:53.460 --> 02:57.525
moving to Texas A&M? Or College Station, is the way 
she put it. And I said, I thought you'd never That

03:03.698 --> 03:05.600
was on a Thursday. The next day, Friday, we got the 
car and came over here, contacted Phil Callahan

03:06.341 --> 03:12.870
down at Remax. Phil showed us a few places in 
subdivisions, you know, with nice homes, but with

03:15.072 --> 03:26.867
10-foot lot lines, 20-foot lot lines. We'd been 
living on a four-acre place, and I just didn't want

03:26.887 --> 03:33.115
to be crowded up like that. so we scattered around 
we found this lot it's one and a third acres and it

03:33.803 --> 04:03.102
was a beautiful tree lot and we said that's where we 
want to build our home and so we did that texas

03:33.803 --> 04:03.102
a m it it formed my military career i was in the air 
force for 30 years, 5 months, and 29 days.

04:08.600 --> 04:22.840
Texas A&M got me my first job other than military 
when I went to work for Governor Bill Clements

04:08.600 --> 04:22.840
through Jarvis Miller. And

04:22.860 --> 04:28.127
I don't know what else I
