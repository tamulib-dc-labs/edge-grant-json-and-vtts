WEBVTT

00:05.718 --> 00:20.637
as crack as the freshman drill team, but still, with the rifles and the marching and all, it's still a pretty sharp outfit and a proud outfit anyway, but comprised of juniors, invited up into three squads, depending on your height.

00:20.817 --> 00:25.282
And, of course, being short, I was in the squatty bodies, the shortest group.

00:25.803 --> 00:26.504
What?

00:26.524 --> 00:27.105
The squats.

00:27.465 --> 00:28.086
The squats.

00:28.486 --> 00:29.167
Squatty bodies.

00:29.187 --> 00:30.208
Squatty bodies, okay.

00:30.969 --> 00:35.455
And we were practicing one day and had our rifles,

00:36.447 --> 00:47.683
The guy who, Wendell Weaver, who was first sergeant when I was a fish in my outfit, had already graduated, but he came back to campus, and he was an RV when he was here, and he came out to watch us practice.

00:48.704 --> 01:01.362
And so here we are marching along, trying to be serious, and he's marching right beside me, just walking along beside me, reminding me of stories and pranks that I had pulled as a fish, and what he had done to me.

01:01.983 --> 01:03.906
And so here I am, laughing, and

01:04.325 --> 01:11.994
And every time I crack a smile, of course, I have to fall out and do 65 push-ups in my class set.

01:12.735 --> 01:28.373
After about four times of that, doing class sets, I fell back in and they said right shoulder arms and I couldn't even pick my rifle up and my hands were so tired and the rifle drank, dropped and clanked all over the sidewalk.

01:28.794 --> 01:31.497
So they stopped the whole squad, made the whole squad

01:31.865 --> 01:41.455
do 65 push-ups, you know, and I wasn't able to do 65 that time, but I did as many as I could and got back up.

01:41.495 --> 01:45.599
But it was funny with him going through some of the stories.

01:45.659 --> 01:50.224
He came in one night and he smoked a cigar and I couldn't stand smoking.

01:50.905 --> 01:59.053
When I was a fish and he came in and about two o'clock in the morning got me out of the sack and made me shine his shoes or something.

01:59.658 --> 02:11.814
He also made me do a lot of push-ups and do duck walking, carrying a spoonful of water, doing a duck walk across the room without spilling any, and every time I spill something, I'd have to do 65 push-ups or something.

02:11.874 --> 02:24.771
Then I had to do a pink stool, holding his RV rifle out as a fish, doing a pink stool, holding his RV rifle out, and he put a trash can on top of my head, and he would blow his cigar smoke up under that trash can.

02:24.920 --> 02:27.389
and here I don't even like smoke to begin with.

02:27.891 --> 02:31.947
And he was reminding me of some of those things that he used to do with me too.

02:31.967 --> 02:35.942
So it was a fun time, but got the whole squad in trouble, so.

02:37.036 --> 02:39.979
All right, let's talk about the serious questions.

02:40.060 --> 02:56.719
During this, while you're an undergraduate, serious concerns are discussed on campus about changing A&M student body and so forth.

02:58.001 --> 03:03.347
And how did you and other students react to these proposals?

03:04.711 --> 03:17.986
The biggest thing, the 60s, you know, we were isolated to a degree as far as we didn't have TVs or anything like that and I for one didn't necessarily keep up with the news like I do now.

03:18.667 --> 03:23.632
Newspaper's about all there was going on but so a lot of things we didn't know was going on.

03:23.652 --> 03:32.963
There was enough going on in the Corps to keep you busy but A&M was, of course it was all male when I started out

03:33.196 --> 03:41.365
and through my time here, except for the last year, there were a few co-eds on campus daughters, professors, and things of that nature.

03:41.725 --> 03:47.752
So when they started talking about integrating, they were talking about integrating with females, of course.

03:47.792 --> 03:52.357
We had many Hispanic students here and foreign students here.

03:53.017 --> 04:02.848
Many of the Hispanics held high level positions in the Corps, were always, to me, some of the sharpest cadets we ever had happened to be Hispanic.

04:03.368 --> 04:07.733
And I never saw any kind of discrimination in that way.

04:08.294 --> 04:09.916
Never heard anybody say anything.

04:10.036 --> 04:17.885
It was a oneness there, regardless of color or race, of those cadets that were there together.

04:17.905 --> 04:19.688
There was a true oneness.

04:19.708 --> 04:22.251
We never got into, I never saw it, never heard it.

04:24.994 --> 04:27.617
The female situation can lie on females at A&M.

04:28.138 --> 04:31.722
Of course, I would have to say that the great majority of the people

04:32.579 --> 04:40.248
and me included, I was definitely opposed to that with every fiber of my being because I always felt like there should be a place.

04:40.809 --> 04:46.957
And of course, I wasn't looking at student enrollment or what might happen in the future or anything of that.

04:46.977 --> 04:52.183
I just thought that we deserved to have a place where there were a place for guys and a place for girls.

04:52.243 --> 05:01.995
That softball is for girls and baseball is for guys and Little League is for boys and Girl Scouts is for girls and Boy Scouts is for boys.

05:02.262 --> 05:03.763
So I didn't see anything wrong with that.

05:03.783 --> 05:07.347
There's a place for that and I still believe that.

05:10.069 --> 05:15.414
Having a daughter that came here and was a great Aggie, you know, I'm glad that it was done.

05:15.894 --> 05:17.316
I'm glad it was done.

05:17.516 --> 05:19.398
But at that time, I was strong against it.

05:19.418 --> 05:22.360
Spoke to the Texas Congress about it.

05:22.380 --> 05:23.001
Went to Austin.

05:23.021 --> 05:31.729
Several of us went to Austin in uniform and spoke before congressional leaders about the situation and from an emotional standpoint,

05:32.165 --> 05:37.090
let us have this one area that's not integrated.

05:37.751 --> 05:39.933
What was their reaction in Austin to y'all?

05:40.574 --> 05:43.017
Totally uninterested in anything we were saying.

05:43.137 --> 05:52.347
I never will forget, it was my first exposure to congressional folks, the politicians, and we thought we had made a good argument.

05:52.447 --> 05:54.890
Now you said Congress, did you mean state?

05:54.930 --> 05:55.470
State, yes.

05:55.490 --> 05:57.172
Not Congress, state legislature.

05:57.192 --> 05:59.335
I'm sorry, state legislature, yes.

05:59.355 --> 06:00.636
The state capitol in Austin.

06:01.882 --> 06:09.510
They were reading the paper, not paying attention, feet propped up, reading a book, and that was my first exposure.

06:09.911 --> 06:22.345
We had prepared a lot, thought we had good reasoning, even though it was from an emotional standpoint, and a personal preference to us, that was important.

06:22.465 --> 06:26.269
We're Aggies, we have emotions, we are passionate.

06:26.289 --> 06:31.635
And it was never an issue of being better than girls, that wasn't it at all.

06:32.054 --> 06:35.038
And when the girls came, I never saw any of them mistreated.

06:35.599 --> 06:41.606
I'm not saying that we went out of our way to just hug them and we're so glad you're here and pat them on back and stuff.

06:41.766 --> 06:44.570
I personally was always polite and kind to them.

06:44.590 --> 06:46.152
That's the way Aggies are.

06:47.534 --> 06:51.419
With Mr. Rudder, did you ever discuss any of these matters?

06:51.439 --> 06:51.679
We did.

06:51.699 --> 07:01.892
As a senior yell leader and as a big proponent of not having girls, I was in his office one-on-one on a few occasions and talking about these matters.

07:02.632 --> 07:05.637
and tears would be strewn down my eyes.

07:05.737 --> 07:28.952
I was past, and even in his, tears would well up in his eyes about it, because he too was an Aggie, and even though he made a decision, it was a tough decision for him, I know it, emotional, and he made a decision with all the vision he had and from the input that y'all gave him, a lot more facts than we did about the future and money and laws and all of that, that we weren't looking at those things.

07:29.032 --> 07:31.896
We were mostly interested in what's this gonna do

07:32.686 --> 07:34.869
camaraderie and our oneness.

07:35.550 --> 07:45.244
But he was always gentle and kind, totally understood our positions, never tried to discourage us from going to Austin or anything of that nature.

07:46.205 --> 07:48.669
Were you here when the first black students enrolled?

07:49.871 --> 07:51.253
I was not.

07:51.273 --> 07:52.775
I was not.

07:52.915 --> 07:54.858
I'm pretty sure I was not.

07:54.958 --> 07:55.639
We might have had

07:56.412 --> 08:07.227
Because as far as I know, the first black students were regular Army enlisted men who came in the summer, paid by the Department of Defense to finish their degree.

08:07.648 --> 08:08.709
And what year was that?

08:08.729 --> 08:09.330
And I don't know.

08:09.530 --> 08:11.593
It's sometime in the 60s, but I don't know.

08:11.773 --> 08:25.913
You know, there has, on reunions and stuff, and on campus there has been a black or two that played football here that has come up to me as if they knew me back in those days, but I cannot remember them being on campus.

08:26.635 --> 08:29.419
heard any cadets.

08:29.599 --> 08:34.566
I was never even on a discussion blasting a person because of their race.

08:34.646 --> 08:39.372
Now, that might be hard to believe, but I'm just telling you the truth from the way I remember it.

08:39.833 --> 08:43.037
I do not remember any of that problem.

08:43.959 --> 08:46.222
Let's talk about the student body in general.

08:46.522 --> 08:49.646
During your era, describe the student body in general.

08:49.706 --> 08:50.688
Where were they from?

08:50.728 --> 08:53.892
Small town America.

08:54.277 --> 08:58.782
Today, so many of them, every time I meet somebody, it seems like they're from Houston or Dallas or San Antonio.

08:59.583 --> 09:01.205
And I usually ask them, now where's that?

09:01.646 --> 09:04.890
Because when I tell them I'm from New Boston, they'll say, now where's New Boston?

09:04.910 --> 09:06.672
So I turn the tables on them.

09:06.692 --> 09:18.046
But back in our day, A&M was, now we always had a lot of foreign students on campus and from a lot of other states because of the military background.

09:18.066 --> 09:23.372
A lot of military kids that grew up all over the country and overseas came here.

09:24.027 --> 09:42.423
So there was that, but at the same time, it was for the people that I was around, most of them, many small town farmers, family-oriented, church-going, strong morals, people of the ground, of the dirt, the ag people.

09:42.563 --> 09:47.608
For one of those students to be accepted by the other students, what mattered?

09:48.068 --> 09:49.730
What were the keys to being accepted?

09:50.330 --> 09:52.532
Whether you are an ag or not.

09:52.799 --> 09:56.344
Now, yes, we would kid people from being from New York or Pennsylvania.

09:56.364 --> 09:59.428
We'd call them Yankees and all that to their face and cut up with them.

10:00.028 --> 10:09.441
But if they came here for the right reason, and to me, the right reason is if you're a giver and not a taker, that's the biggest distinction to me between Aggies and other people.

10:09.481 --> 10:10.302
We're givers.

10:10.322 --> 10:15.769
And that's why I say that there's some students, and even back in my day, I'm sure, not to the tree today,

10:16.289 --> 10:22.597
There's some students at A&M that are here for what can A&M do for me rather than what can I do for A&M.

10:22.617 --> 10:41.880
And so if they had the heartbeat of an Aggie, and I call the heartbeat being someone who's a giver, who'll go the extra mile, who's unselfish, who cares about the other person, who follows the golden rule, who does those behaviors and traits that make a person great and different.

10:41.940 --> 10:45.925
Character, if they have the right character, I could care less about their color

10:50.630 --> 10:51.551
genuineness.

10:52.672 --> 10:57.577
I will say I'm still not a proponent of forcing girls to be in every outfit.

10:57.898 --> 10:59.499
I think they ought to have an outfit of their own.

11:00.140 --> 11:01.562
I think it worked better then.

11:02.463 --> 11:08.109
It just adds problems and it has nothing to do with them being less or not as good.

11:08.589 --> 11:09.850
I promise you that's not it.

11:09.910 --> 11:13.454
There's just a better way to handle it and give them the options.

11:13.474 --> 11:16.097
There'll be more of them selected as leadership positions.

11:16.516 --> 11:17.617
It would be better for them.

11:17.758 --> 11:23.164
An 18-year-old boy doesn't need to be living next to an 18-year-old girl when they've been told that all their life.

11:23.425 --> 11:24.967
I agree with you.

11:26.108 --> 11:35.320
I'll say this too, that many of the girls, when I come back to campus and talk to a lot of the groups, some of the greatest Aggies at A&M are the females.

11:36.161 --> 11:39.385
Many of them top-notch Cracker Jack.

11:39.854 --> 11:46.924
In your day, did you meet yet when you were an undergraduate?

11:46.944 --> 11:49.027
Had you met the young lady that was going to be your wife?

11:49.888 --> 11:50.509
I had not.

11:50.629 --> 11:52.071
I sure had not.

11:52.131 --> 11:53.573
I was 28 before I married.

11:53.613 --> 12:05.109
I left A&M and I was after the service and I went back home to New Boston and I served as youth director in our church for a while and I actually married one of the youth.

12:05.229 --> 12:09.675
My daughter says when she tells everybody, she gets a kick out of this, she says, my daddy was the youth

12:11.815 --> 12:17.001
But we've been married 30 years, and she is a big-time Aggie.

12:17.041 --> 12:23.048
Never had the opportunity to go here, but she loves A&M and is a true Aggie spirit, just like yourself.

12:23.069 --> 12:24.951
Did you have any Tessie dates?

12:27.013 --> 12:30.177
Well, I guess one of the funniest things about, I never actually had a date.

12:30.197 --> 12:36.064
I knew a lot of the girls just from being a yell eater, and our sweetheart was selected from there.

12:36.124 --> 12:39.308
So I got to meet all of them and great, great girls.

12:39.575 --> 12:44.621
I guess one of the funniest things that happened, that my daughter again really likes that now.

12:45.783 --> 12:54.153
At a class reunion here at A&M, my daughter came with us and my son too, but she was a class of 98.

12:54.494 --> 13:03.465
But one of the TWU girls that knew me was telling this story and my daughter just laughed her head off because she couldn't imagine.

13:03.986 --> 13:07.270
When we'd play SMU or TCU,

13:07.773 --> 13:10.658
we would go up and have a yell practice at TWU.

13:11.659 --> 13:34.135
And so a couple of us yell leaders, usually the seniors, I can remember my senior year, a head yell leader went up in their big auditorium and they had all the girls there and there I was, the only guy, I think we had one other yell leader there and the only guy there and doing all this and doing the yells and teaching them the yells and all this.

13:34.756 --> 13:43.947
Yale leaders, you know, and I had on my sweater and I was taking on my sweater and rolling up my sleeves and some girl out in the lobby and says, take it off, take it off.

13:44.968 --> 13:49.413
And so I hovered back at her and I said, I'll see you after the Yale practice.

13:50.174 --> 14:02.468
Of course I didn't, but they had, this girl was telling me, when you came to the campus for Yale practice, she said the girls would have sheets hanging out of their

14:03.022 --> 14:07.827
their dorm rooms with Frank Cox written all over it.

14:07.847 --> 14:08.928
I never knew that.

14:09.128 --> 14:10.649
Of course, I thought it was funny too.

14:10.729 --> 14:19.698
It shows you how hard up they were, but my daughter just got the biggest kick out of that, how anybody could have my name on one of their sheets.

14:19.718 --> 14:22.681
Now, did you and your buddies go to the big dances here on campus?

14:23.381 --> 14:27.645
Yes, the ring dances and combat ball and great times.

14:27.665 --> 14:30.548
And usually, even then, as my junior and senior year,

14:30.832 --> 14:37.943
I wasn't dating anyone in particular and would just usually have dates with different girls that other people usually would fix me up with.

14:38.343 --> 14:40.106
How did Aggies behave at those dances?

14:40.887 --> 14:43.731
Well, I don't remember anything ever getting out of hand.

14:43.872 --> 14:46.335
I don't even know that they had alcohol at them.

14:46.355 --> 14:49.801
Most of them were on campus and I don't believe there was alcohol.

14:50.241 --> 14:53.726
I never saw any fights or anybody getting out of hand.

14:53.746 --> 14:56.130
It was always a close-knit group.

14:58.523 --> 15:01.726
pretty much, for the most part, as gentlemen, I would say.

15:02.847 --> 15:10.154
You, late in your junior year, you bought those boots and you bought a ring?

15:10.194 --> 15:11.355
Sabre.

15:11.815 --> 15:13.077
A ring, yes, yes.

15:13.297 --> 15:14.438
How much did the ring cost?

15:15.059 --> 15:15.639
I think it was $27.

15:15.659 --> 15:20.203
I want to say $27.50 or something like that.

15:20.223 --> 15:21.545
How did you feel when you put it on?

15:21.825 --> 15:26.269
Well, it was, of course, and still is, a great experience.

15:26.806 --> 15:33.195
In fact, I've lost my wedding ring, as you can see, but not my Aggie ring.

15:33.215 --> 15:35.698
So it's a great story.

15:35.718 --> 15:37.200
Do you have any Aggie ring stories?

15:37.701 --> 15:38.883
Well, one of my favorites.

15:38.903 --> 15:44.390
It's not about my own personal self, but I would like to share this because this, to me, really tells it all.

15:45.832 --> 15:47.574
Urban Hopman, class of 1939.

15:47.614 --> 15:51.340
His family had moved from Germany.

15:51.360 --> 15:52.521
They couldn't even speak English.

15:52.541 --> 15:53.422
He came to America.

15:53.503 --> 15:55.345
He wanted to be a farmer and help feed the world.

15:55.477 --> 16:03.385
He came to Texas A&M, the greatest Aggie school in the world, graduated in 1939, was called up into the service in World War II.

16:03.905 --> 16:22.704
He was on Corregidor, April the 21st, 1942, the most famous Aggie muster of all, when the, for weeks, 24 hours a day, they had been bombarded with shells and mortars and bombs and bullets, 24 hours a day, relentlessly, from the Japanese.

16:23.405 --> 16:25.247
On April the 21st, they gathered together

16:25.717 --> 16:29.722
in their foxholes and in different places, the ones that could and had a roll call of the A's.

16:30.162 --> 16:32.445
They had passed away, their buddies that had passed away.

16:32.465 --> 16:36.390
A week or so later, he was captured by the Japanese.

16:36.791 --> 16:49.446
Went on the Bataille death march, escaped, recaptured, was put on the death ships where they were crammed in like sardines, where some of his buddies actually died standing up, couldn't even fall to the ground, they were so crowded in.

16:52.885 --> 16:56.149
We spent three and a half years in a Japanese prisoner of war camp.

16:57.531 --> 17:02.078
One set of prison uniforms, which he cut a little slit in his pants.

17:02.738 --> 17:07.265
During the day, he would put his Aggie ring in that slit of his pants and hide it.

17:07.865 --> 17:15.636
At night, at three and a half years, at the foot of his dirt bed, he would dig a little hole and put his Aggie ring in it and cover it up.

17:16.612 --> 17:24.446
He said that in case I die, in case they ship me out, they might get my watch, but they're not gonna get my Aggie ring.

17:24.466 --> 17:27.912
And to me, that really sums up what the Aggie ring's all about.

17:27.932 --> 17:28.693
What a great man.

17:28.753 --> 17:33.281
There will never be a building named after Herbert Hoffman at A&M.

17:33.962 --> 17:40.594
But he was malnutritioned because of that, became blind, became a rice farmer, served his

17:40.912 --> 17:46.118
What a great man, loved A&M, came back for the 50th reunion, passed away about three years ago.

17:46.238 --> 17:48.581
Would this be H-A-P-T-M-A-N?

17:48.681 --> 17:54.007
Hopman, H-O-P-P-M-A, H-O-P-M-A-N-N, I believe, Hopman.

17:54.027 --> 17:56.390
Hopman, Urban Hopman.

17:56.450 --> 18:08.404
And he, by the way, when he was a freshman, he and a couple of his buddies were the ones who planted the trees that lead in to the main entrance to the campus up to the administration building.

18:09.363 --> 18:17.494
Let's see, on a lighter moment, talk about the student indulgences when you were here.

18:17.795 --> 18:20.338
What were students smoking when you were here?

18:22.281 --> 18:24.264
I suppose cigarettes.

18:24.284 --> 18:29.872
Now, I never heard of marijuana on this campus, and I know it was the 60s.

18:30.052 --> 18:32.676
I never heard of, I never even heard that term.

18:32.696 --> 18:34.678
Yeah, all right.

18:34.819 --> 18:36.241
And you hadn't heard of heroin?

18:36.601 --> 18:37.222
No.

18:37.282 --> 18:38.003
What variety?

18:38.253 --> 18:44.743
First time I heard anything about drugs, it was in a Black Moor Jungle movie that I saw.

18:44.804 --> 18:46.767
What cigarette varieties were the popular?

18:46.787 --> 18:47.468
I imagine camel.

18:47.488 --> 18:47.929
I don't know.

18:48.009 --> 18:49.271
I never smoked them.

18:49.291 --> 18:51.715
And not a lot of my buddies smoked.

18:52.356 --> 18:54.880
And cigars were smoked when?

18:59.207 --> 19:00.649
That was an unusual thing, wasn't it?

19:01.130 --> 19:01.370
Yes.

19:01.410 --> 19:04.455
I don't know whether it was a special occasion or what I ever did.

19:04.475 --> 19:05.577
Did students smoke pipes?

19:07.193 --> 19:13.762
There's one guy that I remember that did, but... And when they drank, what were they drinking?

19:14.783 --> 19:17.507
I never knew of them drinking anything but beer.

19:18.508 --> 19:23.896
I'm sure, I just wasn't around that crowd, but beer's all that I'm aware of.

19:23.916 --> 19:24.837
I'm sure some of them drank.

19:25.458 --> 19:28.362
And you heard about people that went to Whiskey Bridge.

19:29.083 --> 19:32.087
Yes, but I don't know anything about, I never...

19:32.877 --> 19:39.227
Did you ever go out on one of the groups that went skinny dipping at Clay Pits?

19:39.247 --> 19:40.489
No, I did not.

19:40.569 --> 19:43.313
And I don't even know that I knew of anybody that did that.

19:44.555 --> 19:46.719
You know, different outfits do different things.

19:46.739 --> 19:49.623
Everybody thinks that the Corps, they're all exactly like what they're on.

19:49.643 --> 19:51.146
Some of them specialize in different things.

19:51.186 --> 19:53.930
Some of them come to tradition to one of them that's not with another.

19:53.970 --> 19:55.813
But I'm not aware of that.

19:56.063 --> 20:03.671
During your years here, how much did you and your buddies go off campus here in town?

20:05.012 --> 20:06.093
Very, very seldom.

20:07.295 --> 20:12.320
You always had to have your uniform on, except if you were so far off campus.

20:13.181 --> 20:20.228
And just the time didn't allow it, but there wasn't any place to go other than a couple restaurants.

20:20.248 --> 20:23.792
I remember Zorapi's, I believe, was the name of the Mexican restaurant out here.

20:24.110 --> 20:29.297
In my mind, I remember it over kind of toward where the Hilton is now, which was just woods back then.

20:29.838 --> 20:35.706
And then there was a lady downtown that had a home that she opened up that- Big old boarding house.

20:35.726 --> 20:39.311
Yes, and I mean, serve food like your grandmother used to cook.

20:39.731 --> 20:45.039
And you'd go there and you'd just leave a dollar or something, a little bit of money in a jar there.

20:45.079 --> 20:48.564
She never asked you to pay, never checked on it to see if you did.

20:49.245 --> 20:53.170
Just trusted you to put a little money in a jar that she left there.

20:53.210 --> 20:53.931
Did you and your-

20:54.282 --> 20:57.065
Did you and your buddies go very often to the campus theater?

20:58.907 --> 21:00.709
At Northgate?

21:01.109 --> 21:02.331
Yes, quite a bit.

21:02.351 --> 21:05.454
You know, I was telling you a little bit earlier about Markel Williams.

21:05.694 --> 21:12.081
Yeah, and the noise would be over there just like it would be at the... Yes, it was funny there too, just like Guy.

21:12.141 --> 21:19.429
I liked Guy better myself, but I don't know whether... But yes, it was pretty much similar.

21:20.303 --> 21:30.396
The special things that Aggies went to, Silver Taps, do you remember when you first went to Silver Taps?

21:30.416 --> 21:43.832
Yes, it seemed like, and it seemed like not only the first time, but almost every time that it was, it seemed like it was always kind of cloudy and there would be clouds that I remember going by and just the quietness.

21:43.852 --> 21:47.577
You were truly quiet from the time you turned off the lights at 10 o'clock in the dorms

21:47.843 --> 21:49.745
Most everybody lived on campus at that time.

21:49.765 --> 21:51.546
As far as I knew, everybody did.

21:51.586 --> 21:53.088
That's the only ones I was associated with.

21:53.889 --> 21:56.531
And that's a real extra experience.

21:56.551 --> 21:59.754
But everybody at Tim would go over to Silver Taps.

21:59.814 --> 22:02.937
And everybody took it seriously.

22:03.037 --> 22:04.138
Yes, yes.

22:04.158 --> 22:07.021
And you didn't just go once and say, oh, well, I've experienced that.

22:07.081 --> 22:08.042
What you got for me now?

22:08.802 --> 22:10.104
And that's what I see happening.

22:10.124 --> 22:12.826
Those are students again that do it.

22:12.846 --> 22:14.948
But the real eggs, they went every time.

22:15.350 --> 22:15.951
Be silent.

22:15.971 --> 22:20.436
You wouldn't talk until the next morning at 6 o'clock at Whistle Jog.

22:20.457 --> 22:21.177
You truly didn't.

22:21.458 --> 22:22.880
If you had your lights on, they would.

22:23.340 --> 22:27.345
If you had a quiz, you could have your light on, but you had to cover the windows and stuff.

22:28.847 --> 22:31.911
Did you ever go to Silver Taps for someone that you knew well?

22:33.053 --> 22:35.035
You know, thankfully, I did not.

22:35.596 --> 22:36.136
I did not.

22:36.197 --> 22:37.178
I was blessed in that.

22:38.419 --> 22:42.825
It's my second most great tradition in A&M, after Muster.

22:43.497 --> 22:47.262
but it's the one tradition that I wish our students never had to experience.

22:47.282 --> 22:58.018
As great as it is, but what a time, the birds, every time the RV rifles, and the clicking of those hills, the RVs, marching down that walk, and those hills clicking in, you can hear them at the distance.

22:58.659 --> 23:07.311
First time I heard it, man, huh, and then they'd fire those guns and the birds, but you could hear them flying off in the wind, and there was a,

23:08.101 --> 23:12.669
Muster, did you, as far as you recall, did you go to Muster every year here?

23:12.950 --> 23:20.163
Yes, yes, and of course the year back then too they had Yellow Eater read the roll call.

23:20.183 --> 23:20.603
Oh really?

23:20.764 --> 23:29.299
Yes, and so my year we had it outside in front of the MSC on the lawn.

23:29.532 --> 23:31.855
So that's the one I remember the most, of course.

23:34.458 --> 23:41.887
What is it that pulls, what are the events, what contributes to pulling Aggies together?

23:43.509 --> 23:58.628
Well, I'm not saying it's the most important tradition we have, but as far as making the coming together,

23:58.996 --> 24:19.463
the one that makes saying howdy important, the one that makes you want to say howdy to others, the one that makes you want to go to silver taps for a comrade, the one that makes you always want to go to muster from here on out, the one that makes it easy for you to stand as 12th man at the ball games and do all those great things and those great traditions is bonfire.

24:20.324 --> 24:22.247
It's not the most important.

24:23.548 --> 24:28.615
Although, I mean, muster, silver taps, far more important

24:28.713 --> 24:36.282
But the one that makes these others possible is Bonfire because that's where the bonding really takes place.

24:36.302 --> 24:41.769
It goes back to doing something tough together as a unit, as a family.

24:42.350 --> 24:46.155
It will cause you to feel better about it.

24:46.195 --> 24:52.583
Now you're saying howdy to somebody who's been right there beside you, carrying a lot of making it tough, doing something and Bonfire.

24:53.744 --> 24:56.728
And we've gotten away from this some too I'm afraid.

24:57.282 --> 25:05.813
The real purpose of Bonfire to me was always to show our undying love for our school, Texas A&M.

25:05.893 --> 25:10.599
Secondly, way down the list, secondly, is our desire to be TU.

25:12.041 --> 25:24.437
I want to be TU every time, but Bonfire, and it's not the event of that night, it's all the weeks and the hard work and the sacrifice and going the extra mile and being unselfish.

25:24.637 --> 25:26.800
That's what being an Aggie's all about.

25:27.060 --> 25:32.367
And it takes place at Bonfire, and that's what our students are missing today.

25:32.387 --> 25:41.259
And I'm not knocking them, I'm just saying that when I can walk across campus, and I'm nobody, I'm just an Aggie, and nobody ever says howdy to me first.

25:41.339 --> 25:44.423
All the way across campus, something's wrong.

25:45.104 --> 25:46.606
We're going in the wrong direction.

25:46.626 --> 25:48.068
Great kids, I'm not knocking them.

25:48.108 --> 25:51.833
I know they're much smarter than we were, and all that, I hear that all the time.

25:52.274 --> 25:52.534
But,

25:58.370 --> 26:25.845
up for what's right and if we're not careful we can go downhill mighty quick and that's why i think bonfire is so important why i think cut is so important uh against president bowen's wishes on that and i know i'm not the one that has my name on top of the lawsuit but cut is where it happens and you just look at the pictures that's that's what does it like it or not and if you i don't want to hire somebody to do my work for me i don't want to

26:26.348 --> 26:27.369
Next thing, what are we gonna do?

26:27.429 --> 26:29.131
Hire somebody to stand up for us at the ball game?

26:30.052 --> 26:32.354
I mean, that's how strongly I am against it.

26:32.454 --> 26:34.276
I'm not knocking Bowen or anybody else.

26:34.356 --> 26:42.724
I hope you don't feel that way, but I am saying that we better look at this careful, and, cause Aggies want it.

26:43.665 --> 26:44.345
And we can do it.

26:44.565 --> 26:45.506
We can correct it.

26:47.008 --> 26:50.711
We lost focus, I'm afraid, and lost our priorities.

26:50.731 --> 26:52.353
We forgot the sheriff.

26:52.373 --> 26:53.954
Why we have to have that band around?

26:53.994 --> 26:55.596
Why it has to be slow?

26:55.863 --> 26:56.987
Ground has to be leveled.

26:58.030 --> 26:59.375
Why you don't mess around?

26:59.395 --> 27:01.080
Why you don't have fish on that stack?

27:01.120 --> 27:06.920
Why riding that buggy isn't a Six Flags event that you can say, hey, I'll give you a ride tonight?

27:07.120 --> 27:07.341
No.

27:09.312 --> 27:11.134
Excuse me for getting on the soapbox there.

27:11.554 --> 27:11.694
No, no.

27:11.714 --> 27:16.259
All right, then those and the ring and the boots and all.

27:16.859 --> 27:23.185
And then we get to your last week as a student and you go to Final Review.

27:23.205 --> 27:26.889
Who came to Final Review?

27:26.949 --> 27:28.230
Well, all my family.

27:28.270 --> 27:30.852
My grandparents, first time they'd ever even seen a campus.

27:30.932 --> 27:35.156
My aunts and uncles and my great aunt, they came down.

27:35.217 --> 27:38.880
They were just small town folks, never had anything.

27:39.299 --> 27:41.421
So this to them was almost like them.

27:41.461 --> 27:52.312
And you knew you were going off to... Final year was probably the toughest day of my life, really, in a lot of ways.

27:53.233 --> 28:01.521
Because back in our day, you know, most of us graduated in four years, for one thing.

28:01.541 --> 28:04.624
And you weren't hanging around for another year, year and a half, two years.

28:05.525 --> 28:06.566
So it was final.

28:06.646 --> 28:07.467
That was it.

28:07.919 --> 28:19.193
and Vietnam War was cranking up and many were going in the service and truly would be a fine review and be the last time you'd see some of them.

28:21.175 --> 28:33.690
And the closeness and friendships that we developed were so strong and powerful that I can remember I actually fell down to my knees

28:37.636 --> 28:39.721
really almost bawling like a baby.

28:39.801 --> 28:41.125
I can think about it now.

28:41.145 --> 28:45.696
It makes tears right up my eyes to think about some of those guys.

28:45.756 --> 28:48.102
I never, and sure enough, some of them I never saw again.

28:48.588 --> 28:58.364
Did you and your buddies during that spring, did you all seriously talk about where you might be six months, a year later?

28:58.384 --> 28:59.265
I would say no.

28:59.285 --> 28:59.886
Really?

28:59.986 --> 29:01.609
Not that much.

29:01.969 --> 29:11.845
Most of us knew that there was a good chance where we would be because many of us were going in service and we just didn't

29:20.110 --> 29:22.434
Not that much.

29:22.474 --> 29:32.970
And let me say this too, that one of the things that I think is really hurting us today is what occurs after elephant walk.

29:32.990 --> 29:40.102
Elephant walk then was the third most serious event we had after Musters, Silver Taps, elephant walk.

29:40.182 --> 29:41.323
It was not a game.

29:41.404 --> 29:45.510
You weren't belittling people and running down and pointing.

29:45.743 --> 29:55.758
and making fun and throwing stuff at it, and zips are dead, wherever that came, that's as bad as this right here, and beat the hell out of to me.

29:56.359 --> 30:04.712
That kills us because here we are, it's just November, and we're saying that you're no longer a part of the 12th man, you're dead.

30:05.093 --> 30:14.367
Well, they just put their boots on two months ago, and all of a sudden, that's taking the power and authority away from them, and no wonder they might start slacking off,

30:14.600 --> 30:17.364
not going to chow or marching or doing their best.

30:17.805 --> 30:26.517
You know, when they're dead and the underclassmen saying something about being, that is so unaggy and it galls me to think that we let that happen.

30:26.557 --> 30:28.961
And it's one of the things I think we need to reverse.

30:29.722 --> 30:39.136
And as strong as I am on tradition and I've written a book and all that, speak about it and all, an area that I think we could improve and help A&M is elephant walk.

30:39.156 --> 30:43.442
Switch it to between final review and parents weekend.

30:44.907 --> 30:47.350
Put it then, have a special time then.

30:47.390 --> 30:51.054
Otherwise, we're saying, you're no longer the 12th man.

30:51.074 --> 30:53.597
Does that mean I don't be out at basketball and baseball?

30:54.979 --> 30:57.421
And this zip stuff, we've got to nip that in the bud.

30:57.962 --> 31:02.367
But there's nothing sacred about that date, about being before the TU game.

31:02.387 --> 31:11.758
And now, TU game ended the last game even for football, usually, because we didn't go to the bowls then, but now they do, so it's not even the last game.

31:12.177 --> 31:16.345
And there's so much going on, or it was, with Bonfire and TU and Thanksgiving.

31:17.106 --> 31:23.137
Move it, move it to a weekend later on in the year and let those seniors be seniors.

31:23.177 --> 31:29.348
Because when you take away somebody's authority and you make fun of somebody being dead, well, what a killer.

31:29.368 --> 31:34.478
That pulls the rug out from under all of your leadership and authority.

31:34.498 --> 31:35.299
So I think we can make
