00:02.545 --> 00:14.102
This is an interview with area court director 
Frank Keenan by Lisa Walker on the 23rd of

00:02.545 --> 00:14.102
November, 1989, at the Hidalgo International 
Bridge concerning the war on drugs. In the

00:15.303 --> 00:23.575
interest of accumulating knowledge, I'm asking 
you to donate this tape to me or to the Texas A&M Oral

00:15.303 --> 00:23.575
History Collection at the University Archives. 
Is that OK with you? Yes. It's quite OK. Great.

00:29.849 --> 00:32.572
First of all, I'd like to hear a little bit about 
yourself. What's your personal background and

00:32.592 --> 00:37.277
education? Well, I grew up in Detroit, Michigan. 
I'm a graduate of Wayne State University. I have a

00:45.466 --> 00:50.912
master's degree from Eastern Michigan 
University. I've been in customs since 1965. I was

00:55.458 --> 00:59.502
an inspector in Detroit. In 1972, I went to 
headquarters and was there, except for a couple of

01:01.102 --> 01:10.697
overseas assignments. I was there continuously 
until about 1985. And I was an operations officer

01:13.782 --> 01:19.490
in Houston, Texas. And I've been here for the last 
two years as a port director.

01:27.723 --> 01:27.984
Wow. You've worked all over the place. Okay, let's 
get started. First of all, I'd like to ask you, what

01:33.786 --> 01:46.198
was the Customs Service's role in the war on drugs 
through the different administrations,

01:33.786 --> 01:46.198
starting with Carter and ending with President? 
Well, my involvement in the war on drugs really

01:46.218 --> 01:50.142
started in 1973. That was when President Nixon 
began to take a look and saw that United States was

01:59.219 --> 02:13.177
having a major drug problem and every president 
since then has tried to commit resources to some

01:59.219 --> 02:13.177
kind of war on drugs.

02:15.981 --> 02:18.584
Do you want to know what our role is? Yes sir. 
Customs is only one of many agencies involved in

02:18.784 --> 02:22.549
this. We see the war on drugs as a multi agency 
multinational operation customs is

02:28.042 --> 02:56.462
trying to control have jurisdiction on the 
borders airports and seaports at the ports of

02:28.042 --> 02:56.462
entry themselves when one gets away from the ports 
of entry that it becomes under the jurisdiction of

02:28.042 --> 02:56.462
border patrol the Drug Enforcement 
Administration, and other local and federal

02:58.535 --> 03:05.946
agencies. They're only really a small part of the 
total . And has that role changed through the

03:11.333 --> 03:16.661
administrations, or has it changed? I haven't 
seen any change at all from one administration to

03:16.681 --> 03:23.170
the other. There was a slight difference between 
the Nixon and Carter administrations I think

03:28.302 --> 03:58.123
maybe enforcement was downplayed somewhat 
during the Carter administration and then picked

03:28.302 --> 03:58.123
up again quite dramatically at least the at least 
verbally under Reagan and then it's continued

03:28.302 --> 03:58.123
under Bush I haven't seen any difference at all 
between the Reagan administration and Bush

03:28.302 --> 03:58.123
administration except that President Bush has 
done what other presidents have tried to do, and

03:59.757 --> 04:19.919
that is to appoint somebody to be in charge of the 
total operation,

03:59.757 --> 04:19.919
Mr. Bennett. But we haven't actually seen any

04:19.939 --> 04:26.205
action from that office yet. I think things are 
still in the planning stage. They haven't

04:29.255 --> 04:34.701
actually implemented what he has planned. Oh, you 
were reading my mind. That was my next question. It

04:36.944 --> 04:43.291
was about the drug czar and if that's cut down and 
the overlapping of duties between the agencies. I

04:43.311 --> 04:44.453
haven't seen any difference. We're still turf 
conscious, unfortunately. But it hasn't

04:51.241 --> 04:52.282
changed. I worked between 1973 and about 1985 I 
worked overseas a good part of my time with other

05:00.001 --> 05:05.629
agencies, DEA. A lot of the agents, DEA agents I 
worked with overseas were formal customs agents.

05:13.501 --> 05:16.926
And there was always rivalry then. There's 
rivalry now. I hope that Bennett can change that,

05:21.292 --> 05:27.441
because I think it's really counterproductive. 
My attitude is... My personal attitude is that I

05:29.532 --> 05:37.322
don't care who stops it as long as it's stopped. And 
I'm perfectly happy to see DEA take the credit or

05:37.342 --> 05:41.948
Border Patrol or anybody else. Unfortunately, 
very

05:43.450 --> 05:50.760
few law enforcement officers feel that way. They 
want the credit for themselves, and they don't

05:50.780 --> 05:56.147
want to share it. I understand wanting credit when 
credit is needed. It's possible that Bennett,

06:00.099 --> 06:09.529
once we begin to implement these strategies and 
plans, it may be this way.

06:12.072 --> 06:14.294
And I hope that. OK. Coming onto somewhat of a 
different subject, the VA chief, John Laws, was

06:14.314 --> 06:26.607
quoted in a time magazine as saying, we want to talk 
about slowing down the flow of cocaine into the

06:14.314 --> 06:26.607
United States. we should think more in terms of 
demand reduction. Now, besides the zero

06:30.715 --> 06:40.504
tolerance policy, how is Customs approaching the 
demand reduction,

06:30.715 --> 06:40.504
actually? Or as Customs? Well, we're acting on 
behalf of the United States government in other

06:40.824 --> 06:50.933
areas besides enforcement.

06:50.953 --> 06:56.998
Our officers in every court, in every district 
probably in this country, go out on their own time

06:58.919 --> 07:06.430
and on government time and talk to school children 
of all ages. We've instituted a program where we

07:08.393 --> 07:25.498
talk to, first of all, the students to try to 
reinforce the general perception that they

07:08.393 --> 07:25.498
should stay away from drugs. We do about the same as 
the other agencies in that respect. We also have a

07:30.003 --> 07:47.941
program that's

07:30.003 --> 07:47.941
asking American citizens and residents of the 
United States to help us in the drug war by

07:30.003 --> 07:47.941
reporting anything that they think might be drug 
related. If they see something suspicious, an

07:49.903 --> 07:57.951
airplane unloading in a remote airfield, and look 
suspicious in a boat in some harbor or someplace,

07:58.353 --> 08:06.501
then if they think it's drugs, then they have a 
responsibility, we think. And we encourage them

08:06.581 --> 08:08.523
to call us and tell us. And we'll dispatch 
immediately officers and equipment to the area to

08:09.664 --> 08:17.172
try to intercept it. Is that the B alert? That's the 
B alert, yes. There are rewards for that.

08:24.118 --> 08:26.841
Generally, the attitude we've taken is, I've had 
it for a long time, and I think we take it as a

08:28.424 --> 08:31.468
service. We believe that we can't do it by 
ourselves. We can't seal off the borders. We can't

08:40.640 --> 08:51.173
stand hand in hand across the whole Mexican border 
and also across the seaports and airports and so

08:40.640 --> 08:51.173
on. It's impossible. The only way we're ever going 
to stop this is to...

09:01.955 --> 09:03.017
stop the demand. And that takes everybody. 
Everybody has to be involved in that, not only the

09:05.501 --> 09:09.167
small part of it. Parents have to warn their kids 
against drugs. Brothers have to warn their little

09:13.875 --> 09:18.423
sisters and brothers against drugs and so on. 
Everybody has to be involved. I don't see that

09:20.847 --> 09:25.515
happening in the

09:20.847 --> 09:25.515
near future. Going back to zero tolerance, zero 
tolerance, as I understand it, is the policy of

09:26.896 --> 09:37.932
arresting any person and or seizing his property 
that brings in any amount of illegal drugs. Is this

09:38.753 --> 09:42.118
policy still enforced, and is it effective? Well, 
it's not exactly as you describe it. It never has

09:45.483 --> 09:46.345
been. Zero tolerance is an attempt to

09:47.707 --> 09:56.059
make of illegal drugs in any quantities 
responsible for their illegal action. Somebody

10:06.549 --> 10:13.539
who smokes marijuana is doing it illegally. 
Whether it's one ounce or half an ounce or a gram or

10:13.559 --> 10:20.468
whether it's a ton, it's illegal. Zero tolerance 
simply means that if we find it, and we will seize

10:27.157 --> 10:39.134
the conveyance in which it was transported, in 
most cases as an automobile or an airplane or a

10:27.157 --> 10:39.134
boat.

10:40.076 --> 10:54.396
In recent months, if the person who owns the 
vehicle

10:40.076 --> 10:54.396
has no knowledge, if he can satisfy the government 
that He didn't know the person who had the drugs

10:55.557 --> 11:00.563
actually had it. He was not responsible, such as a 
rental agency, or if a parent lets a son or daughter

11:00.803 --> 11:17.543
take a car, or if they take it without permission, 
if obviously they can't control them 24 hours a

11:00.803 --> 11:17.543
day. There are provisions that the property, that 
is the conveyance, is returned to the owner. but

11:25.730 --> 11:27.973
not without penalty. We think that by we, I mean the 
government. The United States Customs Service

11:31.919 --> 11:36.726
did not invent zero tolerance. We didn't make it 
up. We only enforced it because we were told to

11:38.128 --> 11:42.915
right down from the White House. We're an arm of the 
executive branch of government. We do what we're

11:48.643 --> 11:51.106
told. And we do it with as much energy as we can. And 
when they say it's against the law to bring in any

11:55.767 --> 12:06.362
measurable amount of drugs in the United States, 
and if we find it, then we're going to have to bring

11:55.767 --> 12:06.362
it along. And do you see any changes between Reagan 
and Bush in the disenforcement policy? No, I don't

12:15.135 --> 12:16.237
think so. I think Bush

12:16.297 --> 12:22.466
is just as strong against it. As I said before, it 
It's not a criminal, in most cases, a criminal

12:25.720 --> 12:29.284
proceeding. Serial tolerance, at least the 
current interpretation of it, is a monetary

12:30.245 --> 12:47.424
penalty in lieu of seizing the conveyance. We may 
hold up the conveyance for a while, but in most

12:48.165 --> 12:54.512
cases, they can petition and get it back. if

12:55.876 --> 13:21.124
they can satisfy us

12:55.876 --> 13:21.124
well then we can then we will seize it and keep it 
there a lot there are a lot of size to this coin

12:55.876 --> 13:21.124
though because Most people don't own their cars 
free and clear. They buy them on time. The lien

13:32.148 --> 13:42.000
holders have an opportunity to get the vehicle 
back.

13:42.020 --> 13:43.802
In many cases, they do. In most cases, they do. 
Rental agencies get them back without too many

13:45.805 --> 13:51.412
problems. In most cases, the The cars that we've 
seized for either zero tolerance or for

13:52.964 --> 14:04.237
substantial amounts of

13:52.964 --> 14:04.237
drugs have been junkered. Cars aren't worth 
anything anyway. They're worth a few hundred

14:06.159 --> 14:07.661
dollars at best. It's almost as if they know that 
they may get caught. And if they do get caught,

14:14.068 --> 14:22.077
they're not going to lose a paid for valuable car. I 
never thought of it that way. We have a custom

14:25.105 --> 14:26.788
service. We seize cars all the time out here under 
zero tolerance and also under substantial

14:26.808 --> 14:33.997
amounts. And very few of the cars are actually 
forfeited to the government. Very few cars that

14:43.350 --> 14:46.374
have any value on them. Because the ones that have 
value are they have a lien against them, in which

14:46.394 --> 14:52.823
case the lien holder gets them back. or borrowed or 
rented or in some other way not owned by the person.

15:00.090 --> 15:14.892
The ones that seem to be owned outright are 10 years 
old, 150,000 miles on it, and not worth anything

15:00.090 --> 15:14.892
anymore.

15:15.113 --> 15:21.763
According to some estimates that I've read, at 
least a third of all the heroin and marijuana used

15:15.113 --> 15:21.763
in the United States is supplied through Mexico. 
Do you think that this figure accurately reflects

15:25.062 --> 15:29.225
the Mexican drug threat? And do you think that this 
drug threat is increasing, or has it decreased

15:30.126 --> 15:40.075
over time,

15:30.126 --> 15:40.075
or not? I agree with the statistic, with the 
figure. I think it's about right. In fact, it may

15:45.180 --> 15:48.142
even be higher than that. I've heard that we get 
about 80% that we get in this country are either

15:52.388 --> 16:04.040
originate or are transferred through Mexico.

16:04.060 --> 16:04.260
80%. They don't grow cocaine in Mexico, but a lot of 
it comes through Mexico. They do grow opium poppy.

16:14.851 --> 16:20.657
We haven't seen much heroin here lately, but it's 
only because Cocaine is now the most popular drug.

16:30.973 --> 16:34.657
They grow a lot of marijuana in Mexico, as you know. 
And we see more marijuana than anything, even

16:36.219 --> 16:45.910
though the United States is now growing enough 
marijuana in its home that it probably doesn't

16:36.219 --> 16:45.910
need to be imported. But the new threat, from what I 
understand, is something that's just as

16:52.092 --> 17:03.762
dangerous, probably more dangerous even, than 
crack cocaine. And that is a crystalline

17:03.782 --> 17:14.452
substance that's derived from 
methamphetamines. It's coming from East Asia.

17:16.374 --> 17:17.434
It's coming from Korea. We haven't seen any of that 
here. yet, but if there's money in it, the Mexicans

17:21.775 --> 17:31.945
and the Latin Americans and South Americans are 
going to be involved in it. Methamphetamine is

17:31.965 --> 17:36.290
what they used to call speed. And this new form of it 
that's just been discovered out of Korea is

17:37.131 --> 17:44.959
finding its way into Hawaii. It's become already a 
major drug problem in Hawaii. And we're afraid

17:48.823 --> 17:51.225
it's going to find its way in the west coast and then 
the rest of the country. It gets back to this demand

17:57.340 --> 18:00.903
thing. It doesn't seem to matter what we do.

18:05.568 --> 18:11.013
There's always an element of the population that 
wants to do drugs.

18:13.656 --> 18:17.560
They want to do crap even though they know that it's 
dangerous and lethal. There are kids and young

18:22.137 --> 18:26.123
adults who want to do it. And the fact that we say 
it's bad, maybe even makes them want to do it, but I

18:26.143 --> 18:33.293
don't know why they want to do it. As long as that 
demand is there, there's going to be people who

18:33.313 --> 18:41.624
want to make money, and they're going to survive. 
So you think that some of these people, or the

18:42.766 --> 18:49.495
majority of these people, know that it's bad for 
them, but they do it anyway, or... I think they all

18:49.930 --> 18:51.132
do. I think they all do. They all know it's bad, but I 
think the peer pressure is such that it's almost

18:52.874 --> 19:00.223
irresistible.

19:05.610 --> 19:19.228
It's also glamorized, not so much as it used to be, 
but it's glamorized to some extent in movies, in

19:05.610 --> 19:19.228
music, in TV programs.

19:21.571 --> 19:48.169
When

19:21.571 --> 19:48.169
the football player is found to have a drug habit 
and is suspended from football and maybe even

19:21.571 --> 19:48.169
prosecuted by the law, what happens is that he gets

19:21.571 --> 19:48.169
put in a hospital or into a cell And

19:50.343 --> 19:58.171
he gets himself cleaned out one way or another, 
whether he wants to or not. It happens. And then he

20:01.154 --> 20:16.890
goes on TV and becomes an example of somebody who 
went through the drugs but was able to get off it and

20:01.154 --> 20:16.890
now is clean and being productive. And I think it 
gives the message that people, the kids and

20:20.695 --> 20:29.524
others, that, so what if I get hooked on it? I can get 
off it too. And they can put a little list of

20:32.106 --> 20:37.411
celebrities as long as your arm. Instead, they all 
were in it. They all were addicted. And they all got

20:41.355 --> 20:43.437
off it. And if they can do it, I can do it.

20:47.903 --> 20:53.468
Of course, they don't all get off because a lot of 
them die while they're still on it. I think it sends

20:53.488 --> 20:55.290
a bad image. If I had my way, when Joe Hero gets 
busted for drugs, part of his sentence ought to be

20:55.310 --> 21:17.590
that he doesn't talk to the press, media, doesn't 
write a book, doesn't appear on TV, and he sure as

20:55.310 --> 21:17.590
hell doesn't do any community service to put 
himself in an area where he can talk to kids who he

21:18.076 --> 21:19.918
might influence. To me, he ought to be invisible 
for the next five years of his life.

21:26.823 --> 21:42.357
I think about this a lot, and I really believe that 
we do more harm than good when we parade these

21:26.823 --> 21:42.357
celebrities in front of the cameras and let them 
tell their stories. There's a country singer, and

21:43.237 --> 21:47.661
I can't even think of his name, Every time I see him 
on TV, on an interview, he's talking about when he

21:49.092 --> 21:56.221
was in jail.

21:56.241 --> 21:58.524
And he treats it like it was summer camp. And he got 
all these people gathered around him in an

22:00.707 --> 22:08.398
interview situation. And he's talking about the 
good old days when he was in prison.

22:15.827 --> 22:17.850
And it's a stupid image. for them to be showing. 
He's laughing about it. Here he is, a

22:24.922 --> 22:45.582
multi-millionaire country and western singer, 
and the message that he's giving is that he was a

22:24.922 --> 22:45.582
criminal, and he went to prison, he reformed, but 
what they don't say is that he's one of the few

22:24.922 --> 22:45.582
people who has this talent that he could cash in on, 
just like the football player. How many people can

22:45.602 --> 22:48.985
play professional sports? going back

22:50.770 --> 23:20.085
to

22:50.770 --> 23:20.085
the border control operation alliance was a 226 
million dollar operation to fortify our borders

22:50.770 --> 23:20.085
with high-tech equipment and manpower and either 
of your reports received this day and if they did

22:50.770 --> 23:20.085
was it effective we haven't received any in 
customs as far as I know. We're still short-handed

23:24.001 --> 23:29.249
here by at least 20 offices. We haven't received 
any assistance since

23:29.269 --> 23:41.990
this thing was publicized. None. I can't get 
desks, chairs to sit on. I can't get equipment.

23:49.917 --> 23:56.263
Because every time I ask for equipment, my 
district director says we don't have any

23:49.917 --> 23:56.263
equipment money. Every time we try to get 
personnel,

23:56.283 --> 24:03.510
we're in some kind of a freeze, a hiring freeze. Or 
we're told that we've recruited people. They're

24:10.297 --> 24:11.398
in the pipeline. But unfortunately, it takes 
sometimes 18 months or two years in the time to

24:11.418 --> 24:19.165
recruit somebody until he actually puts on a 
uniform No, I haven't

24:20.107 --> 24:29.817
seen anything at all that would indicate that 
we're getting any benefit from this. And what

24:29.877 --> 24:36.964
about the high-tech equipment that I've read 
about, like the balloons with the radar dishes and

24:29.877 --> 24:36.964
the helicopters and the airplanes? Well, yes, 
there are those things. How effective they are, I

24:40.627 --> 24:41.949
don't know.

24:44.952 --> 24:49.236
We have just about every border port on the Mexican 
border, and most of them have a little

24:49.705 --> 24:55.892
international airport. We have one here in 
McAllen.

25:01.059 --> 25:05.624
We have people who are working with our officer 
enforcement investigators. We have uniformed

25:06.926 --> 25:17.839
officers as well who are working, trying to

25:06.926 --> 25:17.839
identify smuggling planes.

25:20.367 --> 25:34.384
I don't know of any incident when we had

25:20.367 --> 25:34.384
called the air wing US Customs and had them 
scramble and go after somebody. I don't know what

25:35.665 --> 25:36.486
they do. I know we've got planes, and I know we've 
got pilots. But I really have never seen any

25:40.131 --> 25:42.353
evidence of them down here. We read about them from 
time to time. Usually when we do read about them,

25:46.999 --> 25:50.323
it's because one of them crashed.

25:55.383 --> 26:12.563
But

25:55.383 --> 26:12.563
as far as the other technology, yes, I think these 
aerostat balloons, one is up along the Rio Grande

25:55.383 --> 26:12.563
near the Big Bend area. Another one is in the 
process of being great. In fact, it's already been

26:15.787 --> 26:19.130
inflated, I think, at Rio Grande City. The one at 
Rio Grande City, when it's operational, should be

26:25.403 --> 26:37.262
able to look all the way to about 150 miles in any 
direction, both on the ground and in the air. And so

26:38.885 --> 26:52.947
that would cover the whole border probably from 
Zapata east all the way to Brownsville in the Gulf.

26:53.737 --> 26:55.179
How effective is that? I don't know. I hope it 
really does a job.

27:01.228 --> 27:03.331
I have a question here about air smuggling. You 
talked about the air and what it is is in many of my

27:03.351 --> 27:13.326
sources air smuggling was mentioned as a primary 
role of trafficking. How is Customs tackling that

27:13.987 --> 27:17.592
problem and how could the effort be improved? 
Well, we don't see air smugglers per se at our

27:22.171 --> 27:34.903
international airport because anybody 
smuggling in an airplane is probably not going to

27:22.171 --> 27:34.903
come into an airport and report to customs if 
they're arriving from Mexico. It's possible some

27:35.524 --> 27:49.157
of the planes that do come in have small amounts 
hidden on the airplane, but we have run a lot of

27:35.524 --> 27:49.157
operations on private aircraft, so we've 
literally We've had mechanics literally take

27:49.998 --> 27:58.390
planes apart to look in to see if there were any 
drugs. And we haven't found any drugs at all during

27:58.490 --> 28:05.380
those operations. That doesn't mean that they're 
not coming in because we found a couple of things.

28:12.049 --> 28:18.098
Number one, the

28:12.049 --> 28:18.098
pilots tend to stick together. people in the 
private aircraft business, whether they're

28:19.934 --> 28:37.961
mechanics or they run these little air terminals 
or gas, gasoline operations, refueling

28:19.934 --> 28:37.961
operations or small terminals at these airports, 
they all know each other. And I have a feeling that

28:38.001 --> 28:47.916
within a few hours of the time we hire an aircraft 
mechanic would look in airframes on a regular

28:49.111 --> 28:55.400
basis. Everybody knew about it who flew an 
airplane. Everybody. And certainly the

29:00.267 --> 29:03.592
smugglers would know as well as the 
non-smugglers. That's not to say the most part.

29:05.114 --> 29:12.384
The smugglers only say what the word gets out very 
quickly.

29:13.866 --> 29:18.713
On the other hand, the border, once you get west of 
Hidalgo, in the Star County and up toward Laredo,

29:20.313 --> 29:30.488
and then northwest of Laredo along the border. 
It's quite remote, more so than a map of Texas would

29:31.789 --> 29:37.838
indicate. Look at a map, it looks like there's 
little towns off here, but there really aren't.

29:41.664 --> 29:44.708
There are a lot of wide open spaces. And every 
ranch, and we're talking about some big ranches,

29:50.013 --> 29:52.195
have private airstrips. There are uncharted 
airstrips we call clandestine probably on both

29:53.937 --> 30:08.790
sides of the border because smuggling not only 
comes north but also goes south. People smuggle

30:11.392 --> 30:18.619
drugs northward, then they smuggle consumer 
products electronics,

30:19.544 --> 30:29.697
radios, TVs, things that are very expensive and 
high rate of duty from the United States and New

30:19.544 --> 30:29.697
Mexico. So it's two ways.

30:34.202 --> 30:42.713
Maybe these aerostat balloons will stop the kind 
of trafficking that we all know happens. These

30:42.733 --> 30:43.914
airplanes come in. They fly low.

30:49.193 --> 30:59.305
under the present radar out of a air control area so 
that unless there's radar looking, we don't even

30:49.193 --> 30:59.305
know they're coming in. They're required by law to 
report when they enter the United States

30:59.966 --> 31:09.498
airspace, but if they're carrying contraband, of 
course you're not going to do it. I really think

31:09.518 --> 31:17.648
that these aerostat balloons will make a big 
difference because They will see planes. The

31:19.663 --> 31:28.932
trouble, of course, is that you can't tell if a 
plane is going to cross the border until it

31:19.663 --> 31:28.932
actually does so.

31:32.736 --> 31:45.389
They can appear to be on radar, appear to be 
following the border, staying on the Mexican

31:32.736 --> 31:45.389
side, and then all of a sudden turn northward. And 
by the time that our radar operators pick it up and

31:49.201 --> 31:55.788
say, hey, a plane just came across. It's too late to 
go after him because he's already probably going

31:57.790 --> 32:08.380
to land in one of these out-of-the-way airports, 
and we're not going to be able to find him anywhere.

32:08.400 --> 32:11.544
I hope that's wrong, but that's sort of the way I 
feel. It's hard. That's our biggest threat, I

32:13.445 --> 32:18.010
think, probably with just almost impossible 
control. So other than the Airstat balloon, what

32:19.762 --> 32:30.733
other technological advances would you like to 
see here in McAllen?

32:33.275 --> 32:49.431
I wish we could find some electronic means of 
looking into cargo

32:33.275 --> 32:49.431
so we didn't have to unload trucks to find the 
contraband. The only way you can look into a cargo

32:49.917 --> 33:06.234
truck to see if there are drugs hidden either among 
the cargo or in the conveyance itself, that is in

32:49.917 --> 33:06.234
false walls of the truck, is on the ocean. And it 
takes two or three hours. There's damage done to

33:09.678 --> 33:13.963
the product. And we have to do this.

33:19.229 --> 33:35.333
gadget that could, a fluoroscope or x-ray, that 
could look into it and that you could tell whether

33:19.229 --> 33:35.333
there was anything going on there, that would 
probably be

33:19.229 --> 33:35.333
a real help to us. But I think the technology is 
probably available for that sort of thing, but

33:35.353 --> 33:47.751
it's so expensive it's only people can afford it, 
people like the Saudi Arabians. They have those

33:49.233 --> 33:53.437
sorts of things on a test basis. I understand 
there's a big machine made in France that Saudi

33:53.517 --> 34:06.469
Arabia had bought to take a look at cargo coming 
into their country. But

34:06.769 --> 34:18.700
as far as I know, it hasn't been effective enough to 
be cost effective as far as I know. I think they'd

34:19.051 --> 34:22.695
pay almost anything to do the work. But they're not 
reliable. But I remember for years Custom Service

34:26.179 --> 34:36.651
has tried to find things that would save them time 
in looking for dope. We've had electronic

34:38.072 --> 34:41.236
sniffing machines at airports. We've done major 
tests in the United States at airports. Ones that

34:46.302 --> 34:48.484
would sniff suitcases that came through it from 
there, across it from there. We had one machine,

34:55.435 --> 35:02.783
yes, that would show an alarm that there were drugs 
in it. We had another machine that we tested that

35:02.823 --> 35:19.180
would, it was hidden inside a

35:02.823 --> 35:19.180
tabletop or counter like in an airport. passenger 
arrives from overseas and picks up his bags. And

35:24.254 --> 35:27.017
the first person he talks to is an immigration 
officer. He sort of bellies up to this counter on

35:28.359 --> 35:38.393
the other side of which is an immigration officer 
and hands him his passport. There was a machine

35:38.473 --> 35:49.588
that supposedly would sniff this person as he got 
close and could tell whether he had been handling

35:38.473 --> 35:49.588
or had any on him These gadgets were so unreliable 
that I reckon they gave up on all of them because I

35:50.092 --> 36:02.706
haven't heard anything about them in a long time. 
I'm beginning to think maybe there is no

36:02.726 --> 36:12.397
way to really look except just tearing things 
apart and looking with the naked eye. Detected

36:12.797 --> 36:13.959
dogs do that. That's probably our best Yeah,

36:16.957 --> 36:34.721
but I don't think they worked out because they 
don't have them now. I remember when they were

36:34.802 --> 36:43.133
catching

36:34.802 --> 36:43.133
them 10 years ago. inspector training or any 
training would you improve in order to make the

36:43.771 --> 36:58.489
Customs Service more efficient in combating 
drugs on Mexican

36:43.771 --> 36:58.489
plants? What aspects of inspector training would 
you improve in order to make the Customs Service

36:58.509 --> 37:08.862
more efficient at combating drugs on Mexican 
plants? Well, I think the most important thing we

37:10.973 --> 37:17.541
can teach new inspectors would be, I don't even 
know if it's something we can teach. It's a matter

37:17.601 --> 37:22.507
of attitude.

37:22.527 --> 37:32.720
We need inspectors who have a commitment to law 
enforcement and a dedication to public service.

37:35.543 --> 37:37.366
And I don't think you can teach that to people. 
There are other kinds of people you go after. but

37:40.302 --> 37:47.531
people take jobs for all kinds of reasons.

37:48.292 --> 37:56.082
Those reasons being probably

37:48.292 --> 37:56.082
important, but they're not important to a lot of 
people. A lot of people take the job because they

37:56.102 --> 38:08.458
pay well, they're steady, in an area where minimum 
wage is really the real problem. You have people

38:08.478 --> 38:09.820
who... After a few years, we made very good money as 
customs officers. There was a certain amount of

38:17.099 --> 38:21.725
stature involved. They recognized members of the 
community.

38:28.114 --> 38:40.971
But if I could teach them anything, I would want to 
teach them

38:28.114 --> 38:40.971
just dedication, integrity, integrity, 
integrity. And I just don't know if you can keep

38:41.153 --> 38:44.138
your mind. We hope we get those people and we 
reinforce it, those who haven't, I think. Because

38:52.572 --> 38:58.221
there are a lot of temptations out

38:52.572 --> 38:58.221
here. They claim there are temptations. I've been 
in the service 25 years and no one's ever offered me

39:00.004 --> 39:06.655
that. And yet... If it happens, I know it happens, 
because this happened right here in this

39:09.065 --> 39:20.297
apartment. I was thinking about

39:20.477 --> 39:33.671
integrity. I do have a question here about it. I'm 
sorry. Oh, no, it's fine. So you do see that the

39:39.187 --> 39:47.814
integrity is a real, the perceived problem is a 
real problem. How much of this do you see, and has it

39:47.975 --> 39:52.519
increased, the rate of which? And what do you think 
is the main cause of the integrity problem? Well, I

39:56.122 --> 39:59.004
see integrity as a problem. I don't know what you 
mean by a real problem. I think the percentage of

40:02.787 --> 40:08.012
officers who

40:10.979 --> 40:14.385
who do things illegal out here is very, very small. 
I really do. I think it's a problem. But in the whole

40:17.811 --> 40:23.019
scheme of custom, it's a minor problem. We've had a

40:23.039 --> 40:33.677
couple of people arrested here, inspectors. The 
reason I'm saying this is I'm trying to answer the

40:33.697 --> 40:37.003
question about what causes it, and I don't know 
what causes it. Since I've been here in Hidalgo,

40:44.741 --> 40:56.878
and this is a big port, I have to go on record as 
saying this is a major port of entry, even though

40:44.741 --> 40:56.878
nobody ever heard of Hidalgo, who's not from this 
area. The port of Hidalgo is one of the biggest

40:56.898 --> 41:01.745
ports on the Mexican border. There are maybe two or 
three in the whole border that are bigger. We have

41:08.540 --> 41:32.128
about

41:08.540 --> 41:32.128
100 employees here, customs,

41:08.540 --> 41:32.128
of whom, well not 100, we have about 90, of whom 75 
are inspectors, and we're about 20 short from what

41:08.540 --> 41:32.128
we are right now. Immigration service has another 
50. The agriculture has another 25. We bring in $50

41:37.126 --> 41:41.692
million a year in revenue. We have a payroll of, I 
don't know what our payroll is, but our officers,

41:43.495 --> 41:59.556
our 80 officers, between them, earned over a 
million and a half dollars just in overtime last

41:43.495 --> 41:59.556
year. And the overtime is about $20.

42:05.510 --> 42:08.594
less than 10% of their total earnings. So it's a 
major operation. Getting back to what I started to

42:12.599 --> 42:24.694
say, since I've been here, we've lost about seven 
or eight officers for what I would call breaches of

42:12.599 --> 42:24.694
integrity. Integrity lapses, or however you want 
to say it. Of those,

42:34.973 --> 42:40.980
Only three were actually indicted for criminal 
activity. Every one of those three

42:42.802 --> 43:04.187
was targeted by Internal Affairs because 
somebody called them and said, I think this guy is

42:42.802 --> 43:04.187
doing drugs or is dishonest or is doing something 
illegal. They don't target them unless somebody

43:05.230 --> 43:14.905
calls and tells them that they're suspicious. And 
they respond. In every one of these cases, two of

43:17.729 --> 43:32.672
the three cases, they gave these people who they 
had been told are dirty, as we say, they gave them

43:17.729 --> 43:32.672
the opportunity They said, well, we'll find out if 
they are guilty. And they gave them opportunities

43:35.688 --> 43:38.411
to break the law. And they did. Two of them did. Two 
of them actually took bribes. One of whom has been

43:45.841 --> 43:47.262
convicted.

43:49.786 --> 43:51.288
I shouldn't say they actually took them. I should 
say they allegedly took them. One of whom has been

43:54.412 --> 43:56.935
convicted of two counts of bribery. The other is 
about to go to trial on the same charges plus

43:57.576 --> 44:02.642
others, plus other charges. All the charges stem 
from the investigation conducted by the Attorney

44:04.816 --> 44:15.970
of Affairs then providing the opportunity for 
these guys to break the law and they broke the law.

44:16.511 --> 44:17.412
Perfectly legal. I'm not saying this in any 
derogatory sense. I'm in favor of this kind of law

44:21.237 --> 44:28.786
enforcement because we find out who the dishonest 
people are. The third of these three was

44:29.647 --> 44:34.013
acquitted.

44:34.600 --> 44:40.466
on drugs, on bribery, it was on passing an illegal 
alien. Now, he was acquitted of that in court, and

44:40.486 --> 44:45.891
he's trying to get his job back. I don't know 
whether he will or not, but I have no opinion on

44:46.071 --> 44:55.540
whether he should be coming back or not. The other 
five of that group of eight resigned in every case

45:05.330 --> 45:20.649
under some kind of suspicion,

45:05.330 --> 45:20.649
in most cases because they were consorting with 
known criminals, even though there was no

45:05.330 --> 45:20.649
specific charges against them. One person 
resigned because he was offered a bribe, didn't

45:22.451 --> 45:32.603
take the bribe, but didn't report to internal 
affairs that he was a prophet of God. And so they

45:38.541 --> 45:49.517
confronted him with that and then he decided to 
resign and then go through trial and so on. But all

45:49.537 --> 46:02.877
of these, if in trying to sort out what these people 
all had in common, it's difficult without

46:06.400 --> 46:12.166
making almost making an ethnic slur because all of 
them are locals. All of them are Mexican

46:13.688 --> 46:14.950
Americans. All of them have contacts on both sides 
of the border. All of them grew up in this area.

46:24.741 --> 46:35.833
And all of them, as I say, have friends, relatives,

46:24.741 --> 46:35.833
some of whom have contacts with It's

46:37.703 --> 46:54.297
not

46:37.703 --> 46:54.297
to say that every local person is a potential 
criminal. It's not to say at all, but that seems to

46:54.317 --> 46:57.163
be the problem.
