00:01.938 --> 00:13.722
We are in the Planning Department of the City of 
Houston, and I'm interviewing Johnny Rea.

00:14.163 --> 00:15.606
Johnny, how do you spell your last name? R-A-I-A. 
R-A-I-A. How long have you been with the Planning

00:19.554 --> 00:22.680
Department? I've been here since, well I've gone 
and come back, I've been here over 30 years but

00:23.015 --> 00:52.245
there was a period that I left from 56 to 58 and went 
out into the private sector and I worked with an

00:23.015 --> 00:52.245
engineer and my training was in architecture and I 
wanted to get into that and unfortunately I left at

00:23.015 --> 00:52.245
kind of a bad time economic wise and so I came back to 
the planning department and I've been here ever

00:23.015 --> 00:52.245
since. When did you join the Planning Department? 
What year was that? It was in 55. 55. And that was

00:59.186 --> 01:02.550
under which name? Ralph Elliford. Ralph 
Elliford. I served under every director we had

01:03.951 --> 01:10.177
because Ralph was the first. Mr. Elliford was 
replaced by whom? Roscoe Jones. Roscoe. And then,

01:14.261 --> 01:17.625
of course, we have Mr. Garcia now. What have been 
your assignments in the department? Well, I

01:23.292 --> 01:41.776
started out in the drafting section, hosting 
subdivisions, and there came a time when we needed

01:23.292 --> 01:41.776
to have some public information, a person that 
could handle the public and interface with the

01:23.292 --> 01:41.776
engineers and the realtors and the public and the 
whole spectrum. So I was very much interested in

01:41.856 --> 01:46.422
that, so I took that. And I've had the public 
information section since then. Let me just stop

01:50.087 --> 01:51.088
this one.

01:55.507 --> 01:58.770
So you've been dealing with the public for quite a 
few years. How long has that been? Well, I left in

02:01.292 --> 02:04.536
56. I went to work as an engineer. And actually, we 
were doing a lot of apartment building. It was

02:10.481 --> 02:15.126
really the rational apartments that were just 
beginning in Houston. And then we hit a period of,

02:15.146 --> 02:18.749
they call it, an economic recession. More like a 
depression than a recession. And so business was

02:22.513 --> 02:25.075
kind of rough. And at that time, there was some 
changes happening in the planning department.

02:31.606 --> 02:32.888
What kind of changes? Well, the assistant 
director, Fernando Williams, he and one of the

02:33.148 --> 02:51.012
planners, they're now Williams and Crawford, but 
it was Fernando Williams and Harold Crawford,

02:33.148 --> 02:51.012
they were forming their own company and they left. 
And so there was just sort of a rearranging of new

02:51.818 --> 02:57.805
people being hired in the department. So I came 
back. And that's when we really specifically set

02:59.627 --> 03:05.834
up a public information section. And it was just 
sort of a realignment of duties within the

03:05.854 --> 03:11.101
planning department. And I've been handling that 
ever since. And there were times, of course, that

03:14.064 --> 03:18.349
was a growing period. And there was just constant 
information of realtors coming in for their

03:19.105 --> 03:34.620
clients, the clients coming in, and engineers 
coming in and checking on subdivisions and

03:19.105 --> 03:34.620
widenings, and the whole planning process as it 
was operating then. It was just handling the

03:34.640 --> 03:38.724
public for that period. Well, you've observed 
several styles of planning under the three

03:38.744 --> 03:43.388
directors. Could you characterize those 
different styles of planning? and the role of the

03:47.624 --> 03:50.829
department? Oh, sure. I would say under Mr. 
Elford, it was just the beginnings, the concepts,

03:52.170 --> 04:05.589
and the major thoroughfare as we know it today was 
born with him. That's when he was formally

04:05.649 --> 04:11.117
presented, and he laid the groundwork for the 
entire as we know it now, and I deal with major

04:11.755 --> 04:18.664
thoroughfares all the time, so that's sort of like 
the reference point. And then Mr. Jones continued

04:19.705 --> 04:30.018
it, and of course Mr. Garcia is going into a 
different phase because he's incorporating a

04:19.705 --> 04:30.018
different concept. They're going into a 
comprehensive plan, and I might say that before we

04:30.278 --> 04:39.990
did a subdivision doing Mr. Jones's, Well, Mr. 
Elliford was just in the sharp stand of Westbury,

04:40.392 --> 04:45.379
and all of those were coming in. And then he left in 
1963, and the building had already started. And

04:53.450 --> 04:54.792
then he started. It was just a continuous flow of 
subdivisions, and we just had a fantastic amount

04:54.812 --> 05:02.723
of subdivisions that went from doing that to Mr. 
Johnson's period. That was about the time that

05:02.743 --> 05:06.028
Vernon Henry left. the department and open his own 
practice? Vernon Henry was active. He was a

05:13.329 --> 05:17.595
subdivision planner and he also was when we had the 
zoning effort. We had a zoning effort here and he

05:17.816 --> 05:23.223
worked with a planner in that section. It was 
called Otto Krebs. Otto Krebs. He's since passed

05:27.729 --> 05:28.730
away. But they had the big zoning effort and that 
failed and he left pretty soon after that. and

05:36.637 --> 05:37.838
started his own office. I think he was with 
Newhouse and Taylor first, and then he formed his

05:38.940 --> 05:43.425
own office. You've probably talked to him since. 
Yes. And Mary Lou. And Mary Lou. And she worked here

05:47.290 --> 05:48.051
too. I think that's where they met, isn't it? It was 
an office romance. Well, not exactly at first, but

05:54.298 --> 05:59.825
I guess you could say it evolved. Evolved, yeah. 
Okay. Ross goes... view of the role of planning in

06:08.007 --> 06:14.233
Houston I think was quite different than Ralph's. 
I would say he wasn't here at the beginning, so I

06:16.355 --> 06:29.727
think he pretty much followed the groundwork that 
was laid with the authority that he had. Which was

06:30.768 --> 06:32.329
apparently quite limited. Was Ralph's authority 
so limited? Oh, when you're beginning something,

06:38.045 --> 06:45.936
I would imagine everyone is, well, I'll use the 
Major Thurford as a good example. If it wasn't

06:46.677 --> 06:56.891
anything that, of course we had a skeleton out on 
the front, but he was the one that formalized it and

06:46.677 --> 06:56.891
had a major, which is what we were using as our 
Bible, pretty much. So if you're starting

06:56.911 --> 07:00.396
something, then by sheer necessity, you're 
starting it. Mm-hmm. Then, of course, there were

07:02.142 --> 07:31.963
variations on the theme and different 
alignments, but it was pretty much the Planning

07:02.142 --> 07:31.963
Commission was sort of using that as the 
groundwork and was sort of carrying through a

07:02.142 --> 07:31.963
concept that was born, Mr. Elford, born with Mr. 
Elford and carried on by Mr. Jones, because it had

07:02.142 --> 07:31.963
already been laid out and the construction and the 
planning had started using the developers as they

07:02.142 --> 07:31.963
presented their plans and got them processed 
through the Planning Commission. Has the

07:33.226 --> 07:44.539
succession of mayors made any impact on the 
practice of planning in Houston that you can

07:33.226 --> 07:44.539
characterize? I would say this, in Whitmer's 
administration, well, Mr. Garcia has a complete

07:45.040 --> 07:58.476
set of authority as it stands now. He's gone into a 
number of things that I don't think we're here

08:01.357 --> 08:05.744
doing Mr. Johnson's administration. This is a 
whole different concept. He has the mayor behind

08:08.428 --> 08:10.751
him in everything that he does. Are you suggesting 
that this hasn't always been the case? Oh, well, of

08:16.260 --> 08:20.226
course not. works at, serves at the pleasure of the 
mayor. So it's just that you have a different, you

08:24.527 --> 08:37.911
have a person now that seems to have brought Mr. 
Garcia in to do a planning, even changed the name of

08:24.527 --> 08:37.911
the department before it was city planning. And 
that's called planning and development, which

08:38.431 --> 08:46.925
means that it's one of the most significant 
changes, I would say, is this development

08:38.431 --> 08:46.925
process. I've been working a little with that, 
too. And that's where we get a chance to look at the

08:48.488 --> 08:52.915
construction where we didn't before. The main 
thrust of a development plant is a setback. And

08:57.002 --> 09:00.468
that was evolved because we had a major 
thoroughfare. Woodway is a major thoroughfare.

09:04.030 --> 09:06.434
We didn't have any setback lines. If we had 
widening, it was precisely for the waterway and

09:06.494 --> 09:13.266
suggested setback lines. Now, with the 
development plants, you have a firm 10-foot

09:13.807 --> 09:21.079
setback on a local street, a 25-foot setback on a 
major thoroughfare. Woodway has some tremendous

09:21.861 --> 09:26.148
office buildings that are built right on the 
property line. We asked them, suggested setting

09:26.969 --> 09:29.734
it back. They said, we can legally do this, so 
they've done it. And so now we have what is referred

09:33.219 --> 09:44.437
to as Woodway Canyon, because if you drive along 
the street, you'll see that these buildings, you

09:33.219 --> 09:44.437
have the sensation they're falling in on the 
river. That's quite ironic. So this is a good

09:45.179 --> 09:45.960
concept. That's quite ironic, because that's the 
neighborhood that Ralph Elliford lives in. But

09:52.343 --> 09:55.066
see, back then, we didn't have the authority for 
setback lines. We had four, and there was a

09:55.086 --> 10:00.611
tremendous- When did that happen, that the 
authority was given to you? Oh, it was 82. 82. Now,

10:03.233 --> 10:07.937
with Mr. Elliford, he did the, like I say, the major 
thoroughfare plan was laid out. Then we had an end

10:08.558 --> 10:09.939
one. When I came into the department, we were doing 
what were called alignment studies, where we were

10:09.959 --> 10:19.448
taking the major thoroughfares and actually 
designing the widening, going- say taking aerial

10:19.664 --> 10:32.137
photographs, taking base maps, going out in the 
field and picking the most economical route to lay

10:19.664 --> 10:32.137
out and coming back in, making an alignment, 
presenting it to the mayor, approved by council.

10:33.058 --> 10:34.800
Who was the mayor then? When I first came in, it was 
Couture. And then there was a succession. He

10:41.367 --> 10:45.071
served under a number of mayors for 20 years. And 
that was really good. a large part of the operation

10:47.795 --> 10:51.583
with the alignment studies. And that's the, 
continued that process after it was, the mayor and

10:52.524 --> 10:57.374
council approved it. It went to the permit office 
and they literally held back a building. They have

11:02.484 --> 11:04.268
the authority to hold back the building from 
within those right-of-way lines that we had

11:04.653 --> 11:08.559
proposed. It was sort of like an official plan line 
then. Well, it was, sure. That kept the corridor

11:12.205 --> 11:14.268
free. Right, but that was as far as the corridor, 
but no setbacks. No setbacks. We had suggested

11:17.713 --> 11:21.379
setbacks, but there's no way to say they could 
build right on the proposed, up to that point,

11:21.578 --> 11:26.768
building lines that was known were there. 
Normally, setback, side and rear and front yard

11:27.128 --> 11:34.382
setbacks are included in a subdivision, I think. 
Yes, now that's usually the interior lot lines and

11:34.402 --> 11:40.053
the rear property lines are handled by the permit 
office. But these were the setback lines on the,

11:40.654 --> 11:45.122
between the public right-of-way and the private 
property. And that was the main, at least we had

11:49.026 --> 11:56.274
that as a tool until we got the development plan. Of 
course, in subdivisions, we did have a full range

11:56.294 --> 12:07.966
of setbacks for your subdivisions, depending on 
whether it was residential. Residential even had

12:07.986 --> 12:10.929
a further setback than we use now. It was a 35-foot 
setback off of a major thoroughfare. And then

12:14.347 --> 12:19.473
they'd have 25-foot setbacks off of your local 
streets. That was in a residential. And of course,

12:21.775 --> 12:23.657
they could set back further. We have a number of 
rural subdivisions where they even have as much as

12:23.677 --> 12:34.870
50 and 75-foot setbacks back when they thought 
that it was going to be out in the country. And

12:34.890 --> 12:37.452
unfortunately, the country now is part of the 
city. So they're trying to get those setback lines

12:37.492 --> 12:43.459
changed around people in that area so they can use 
that property. I don't know if that's, I guess

12:44.063 --> 12:54.022
that's in business because it showed a thinking of 
a subdivision back at that time.

12:54.443 --> 13:01.517
Have you noticed any change in the structure of the 
department itself? Oh, yes. How has that changed

13:02.659 --> 13:04.823
through the years? Well, through the years from 
alignment studies. Because you've been here the

13:08.201 --> 13:10.624
longest of anyone. And so I'm relying on your 
memory in terms of the dynamics of the

13:10.845 --> 13:19.056
organization. Well, I'd say, as I've mentioned, 
the alignment studies were really the important

13:19.076 --> 13:23.362
things. When the subdivisions weren't, you know, 
there just weren't that many. They were here, and

13:28.549 --> 13:31.894
we were guiding them as it happened. But then I 
would say the... that's when it started picking up

13:34.553 --> 13:38.564
with the tremendous development that we've had. 
So the importance shifted from the alignment

13:39.306 --> 13:50.335
studies, which are now laid out, so it actually 
came along at the right time, because we had

13:39.306 --> 13:50.335
actually had a chance to lay out all of the 
alignment and the major third figures. so the

13:50.737 --> 13:58.369
developers could then, when they designed their 
subdivisions, they were aware that they had to

13:50.737 --> 13:58.369
dedicate the right of way for major 
thoroughfares. So then it shifted from alignment

13:58.849 --> 14:04.738
studies to these subdivisions that were actually 
developing the land. And of course now the

14:06.000 --> 14:14.854
subdivisions have sort of, because of the 
economy, we don't have the volume of subdivisions

14:15.492 --> 14:18.615
that we've had back when, say, Mr. Jones was here. 
He was here at the peak of the development, our

14:18.635 --> 14:23.320
subdivision development, I would say. And so now 
we're getting into the comprehensive plan where

14:23.340 --> 14:32.730
we're going now into neighborhoods are being 
stressed more than they were. And you're doing it

14:32.930 --> 14:37.154
by sectors, aren't you, or quarters or whatever? 
Just announced yesterday. And of course, in the

14:40.077 --> 14:44.622
past, we've had, they're called sectors now, but 
we've had under the other directors. So they were

14:48.803 --> 14:55.974
called planning units, planning areas, 
neighborhood studies. But now I think he's

14:56.956 --> 15:01.783
getting it into a formalized set of land areas that 
we can look at and just go into the studies

15:02.219 --> 15:10.751
in-depth. Money has a lot to do with that, too. 
Maybe we're getting a little more money for these

15:13.915 --> 15:19.623
studies that we've never had before. I guess when 
things got breakneck speed with subdivisions, I

15:19.643 --> 15:30.117
guess we were assuming we were pushing out and we 
weren't thinking of the interior in it. the

15:30.788 --> 15:34.312
interior neighborhoods take care of themselves. 
But that's the difference, I would say, in the

15:35.453 --> 15:45.885
mayors, is that you've got a mayor now that's very 
much interested in the interior neighborhoods.

15:48.247 --> 15:55.355
Well, I think that's interesting in terms of the 
current economy and in terms of transportation.

15:57.217 --> 15:59.800
Certainly, Houston is not a joy to commute in. And 
that brings up the topic of Metro. Would you like to

16:05.842 --> 16:09.546
prepare to comment on Metro at all? Well, Metro, 
there's a need for it this year, and it's a thousand

16:09.586 --> 16:17.976
percent better than what we've had in the past. I 
mean, at least you've got bus routes now that you

16:18.237 --> 16:22.842
can rely on. There seems to be some tremendous 
leadership. From my impression, they're also

16:25.606 --> 16:29.871
getting into the... some of the repair of streets 
and some of the things from their monies that

16:30.256 --> 16:40.529
they're getting through the one percent sales 
tax. One percent. Everybody keeps thinking it's

16:42.511 --> 16:45.055
one cent, but it's one percent. They're getting 
charged tremendously. I would say more than the

16:48.379 --> 16:56.069
city of Houston would because when it was, we were 
the ones that actually did the beginning of Metro.

16:56.589 --> 16:58.091
And it was a unique thing. It was... the county was 
divided into five parts, and so they knew that the

16:59.213 --> 17:19.571
whole county wasn't, maybe there might be a 
different number, so they divided it into five

16:59.213 --> 17:19.571
parts to see which areas would be interested, and 
as it was voted on, four parts voted for it, one part

16:59.213 --> 17:19.571
voted against it, and they chose not to be in it. I 
don't know if you know this or not. No. But the

17:21.893 --> 17:28.579
eastern part of Harris County, say from US 59, East 
Texas Freeway, around to the Gulf Freeway, which

17:29.302 --> 17:40.152
are all the smaller cities of Winter Park, 
December City, and those cities chose not to

17:29.302 --> 17:40.152
participate in Metro. So they do not collect the 1% 
sales tax. So what you've got is all the north and

17:44.415 --> 17:53.563
west areas that are, that's where all your money 
from Metro is coming from. It's kind of a unique

17:53.583 --> 17:54.784
thing. I thought we were taking less than a unit to 
do this. Frateras County is a pretty big county as

17:59.255 --> 18:07.125
they go in Texas.

18:07.406 --> 18:17.279
When the city attempted to do this, then the bond 
issue failed, as I recall, and that was something

18:07.406 --> 18:17.279
of a setback. But then Metro was reorganized under 
a separate administration, and then they were

18:17.720 --> 18:27.152
able to move independently of city 
administration, which probably turned out to be a

18:27.520 --> 18:29.363
good thing. Yes, I mean, because they had a 
different priority. But the way we interface now.

18:35.547 --> 18:38.390
Excuse me, are you Mr. I was going to say they have a 
set of, but the interface with the city is the fact

18:38.410 --> 18:47.741
that they are now taking some of their monies for 
the repair streets. And they're taking the

18:48.182 --> 18:58.894
parking lot lots and that seems to be a successful 
operation also where people are willing to get out

18:48.182 --> 18:58.894
of their cars. Well, actually, they get in their 
cars, park them, whatever, and then take their

18:58.874 --> 19:04.266
ride into town. It's an interesting concept. I 
guess it's been done all over the nation, but it's

19:06.210 --> 19:10.920
the first time in Israel we've ever done it. That's 
a new concept, and it seems to be working out pretty

19:11.120 --> 19:15.229
good. And then the Highway Department has 
cooperated in terms of bus lanes and whatnot. Now

19:21.901 --> 19:24.745
that's another concept that Metro started. And it 
seems to me, except for the people that are in the

19:25.325 --> 19:30.392
cars, I'll add that. I get the complaints from them 
that some people say that that's taking something

19:30.732 --> 19:38.162
away from the... from the automobile, but we've 
got to live together. If this can carry a lot of

19:43.876 --> 19:51.146
traffic and a lot of people to a destination, then 
so be it. We've got to work. That's part of the

19:53.769 --> 19:55.871
implementation of the plan. And we're still using 
the major thoroughfare plan that was laid back by

19:56.212 --> 20:01.198
Mr. Olford years ago. And the more I see it, the more 
I think it's brilliant the way he did it. The major

20:09.378 --> 20:29.310
change that you've mentioned seems to be a change 
in terms of the attention of the planning

20:09.378 --> 20:29.310
department moving away from the periphery and 
concentrating more on infill and more on the needs

20:09.378 --> 20:29.310
of commuter traffic. and mass transit. And 
actually, I don't know if you can say that the

20:33.636 --> 20:39.523
Central Business District is as important as it 
was back then. It seemed like when ASAP first came

20:40.765 --> 20:48.934
in, the Central Business District was the main 
thing. And it seemed like we did early subdivision

20:48.954 --> 20:58.926
studies before the, that might be another thing I 
want to add, that we were doing subdivision

20:48.954 --> 20:58.926
studies back, when there wasn't as many 
subdivisions coming in. And the stress was on

21:03.393 --> 21:06.159
single-family residential. It was supposed to be 
that way. And as things at Breakneck Street got

21:08.203 --> 21:16.020
more and more, we didn't do the studies as much as 
coordinating and giving the engineer a chance to

21:16.591 --> 21:27.169
do the design of his particular subdivision and 
thus coordinating it with the overall major

21:16.591 --> 21:27.169
thoroughfare network. That's kind of a different 
attitude also. But in doing the subdivision's

21:31.196 --> 21:41.434
design and the engineer feeling that he had to 
pretty much conform to that design, it was left up

21:31.196 --> 21:41.434
to him. to just to interface with a sort of like a 
guide rather than a controller. Maybe I'm using a

21:48.182 --> 22:07.666
little bit of diplomatic language, but rather 
than us designing a subdivision for someone here,

21:48.182 --> 22:07.666
an engineer feeling compelled to use that design, 
Mr. Jones said let the engineer design it and we

21:48.182 --> 22:07.666
coordinate it with our overall plan. So that was a 
little bit of a different kind of thing. The lead

22:10.507 --> 22:15.394
now is probably being taken a little bit more by the 
department. It sounds like there's a much firmer

22:15.415 --> 22:28.475
control and much more enthusiastic applying of 
rules and regulations.

22:32.941 --> 22:38.590
Johnny, are there any comments that you'd like to 
summarize with? Well, I've enjoyed the

22:39.278 --> 22:55.375
department and enjoyed my, as I say, my expertise 
is in public information, and I thought it would be

22:39.278 --> 22:55.375
over, but there seems to be, the more we go, the more 
the public needs to be informed. And this is one

22:55.395 --> 22:57.760
thing for my standpoint, is I find that explaining 
to a person, any individual, even when they

22:58.550 --> 23:09.323
haven't conformed to the rules and regulations, 
if you explain it to them reasonably, they seem to

22:58.550 --> 23:09.323
understand. And it's an educational process. 
There's one thing I'd like to ask you. If you know of

23:15.571 --> 23:26.565
any documents that I can use in writing the history 
of planning in Houston, that might be important.

23:27.119 --> 23:32.727
If you could get those together for me, I would very 
much appreciate it. And I can return them. We've

23:34.570 --> 23:39.497
got some things here that I hand out to people 
constantly that come in from out of state. Out of

23:39.958 --> 23:44.325
the city, but out of state because of our unique no 
zoning. So there's some information. We have some

23:46.107 --> 23:50.774
papers that Mr. Jones had a paper on non-zoning in 
Houston. And then there was an attorney that Mr.

23:50.914 --> 23:55.962
Olson, That was the city attorney here that had a 
speech that he seemed to cover pretty well. The

24:03.652 --> 24:07.396
district said it's an alternate to zoning. And 
there was an architect that, from his standpoint,

24:07.416 --> 24:11.159
I'll get that for you also. OK. I'm going to be here 
probably till about 3 this afternoon. So maybe I

24:15.804 --> 24:18.006
could drop back after. Sure. I've enjoyed it very 
much. Thank you very much.

24:28.223 --> 24:37.695
The same day, we're in the office of Ephraim 
Garcia, the Planning Director for the Department

24:28.223 --> 24:37.695
of Planning and Development for the City of 
Houston. Ephraim, you came from San Antonio.

24:41.480 --> 24:42.021
That's correct. You worked for Winston-Martin. 
Winston-Martin, the San Antonio Development

24:43.503 --> 24:45.946
Agency. What was your responsibility in San 
Antonio with Winston? I was the manager of the

24:51.052 --> 24:56.239
project Planning and Management Division. We 
planned the various projects and then managed

25:01.093 --> 25:07.880
them after they were funded. These involved 
neighborhood redevelopment projects, downtown

25:07.900 --> 25:17.209
redevelopment projects, all the activities of 
the development agency. That development agency

25:17.289 --> 25:22.615
is somewhat unusual in Texas, isn't it? Well, I 
think it's somewhat unusual nationally in that

25:23.017 --> 25:30.245
the urban renewal projects that were handled by 
that division have been successful throughout

25:23.017 --> 25:30.245
that agency. And so that in San Antonio, the urban 
renewal program is pointed out as a successful

25:31.005 --> 25:43.559
program, where in many cities in the country, it 
was an unsuccessful program.

25:43.579 --> 25:45.781
Then you got the call from Houston. That's right. 
When was that? How did that happen? Would you

25:50.894 --> 25:53.918
describe the circumstances and the date? In 
November of 1982, I received a call from a member of

25:55.080 --> 26:06.656
the mayor's staff asking me to submit a resume, 
that they were looking for a planning director and

25:55.080 --> 26:06.656
I had been recommended. At that time, they didn't 
indicate who I had been recommended by.

26:13.986 --> 26:19.534
So I was not particularly over enthused with 
coming to Houston, but I did send them a resume. And

26:20.324 --> 26:23.307
I didn't hear anything from them from that date 
until Christmas. A week after Christmas in 1982, I

26:23.608 --> 26:27.512
received a call. Could I come up and meet Kathy 
Whitmire and talk to her about the position? So I

26:34.920 --> 26:38.504
came up here, and I had about a two or three hour 
conversation with her. Left and went back home.

26:41.628 --> 26:45.572
And the next day, they called me up and said that 
they were prepared to offer me the position. Two or

26:46.227 --> 26:48.009
three hours is a long interview. You're right. We 
went over a lot of... It must have been serious.

26:53.597 --> 26:59.546
And I wasn't quite that sure that I wanted to come up 
because there was a lot of things going on in San

26:53.597 --> 26:59.546
Antonio. I was thinking of going into the 
consulting business and phasing out of the San

26:59.586 --> 27:05.915
Antonio Development Agency and so forth. And so I 
rejected the job offer and said that I was not

27:05.935 --> 27:13.786
interested. Then... I began to get telephone 
calls from various people, from Councilman Ben

27:16.315 --> 27:32.284
Reyes, indicating that they

27:16.315 --> 27:32.284
had been pushing Kathy Whitmire to get Hispanic 
department directors, and I was the first one, and

27:16.315 --> 27:32.284
that I was qualified, and I was turning them down. 
And then there's a phone call...

27:40.008 --> 27:47.497
We were at the point where I turned the job down, and 
so I began to receive certain phone calls from

27:40.008 --> 27:47.497
Houston people asking me to take the job. Then 
Kathy Hoodmeyer called and asked me to come up

27:48.999 --> 27:54.566
again for another interview. Now, what I found out 
had happened is that they had, when I turned the job

27:54.586 --> 28:07.602
down, they went out to various planning 
consultants and people here and asked for

27:54.586 --> 28:07.602
recommendations for a planning director. not 
telling them that I had turned the job down. And

28:10.720 --> 28:15.664
when the recommendations came in again, my name 
was at the head of those recommendations. So they

28:15.684 --> 28:21.449
decided to make a renewed effort to get me to.

28:22.110 --> 28:28.095
And so by then, with the second interview, I knew 
that I was kind of in a negotiating position now.

28:33.079 --> 28:38.263
So we began negotiating as to what was involved.

28:39.357 --> 28:54.717
We arrived at a consensus that if I took the job, I 
would be given the free hand in reorganizing the

28:39.357 --> 28:54.717
department, that the personnel would be provided 
that I needed, that I could integrate. Since my

28:54.917 --> 29:08.014
primary efforts in San Antonio had been 
redevelopment, and I was very interested in that,

28:54.917 --> 29:08.014
that economic development and redevelopment 
would be made a part of the department instead of

28:54.917 --> 29:08.014
separate divisions. And also that the computer 
system that the city was introducing, the

29:09.142 --> 29:17.976
Metricon computer system, would be assigned to 
the department. At that time, I thought it was a

29:18.737 --> 29:20.700
plus. I found out it was a liability afterwards. 
And so we arrived at an idea that if I took over, I

29:24.005 --> 29:37.005
would basically be given a free hand in the 
department, that she was ready for planning, that

29:24.005 --> 29:37.005
she was ready for initiating redevelopment. that 
prior mayors had ignored redevelopment

29:37.289 --> 29:39.832
entirely. Houston was a new construction town, 
and you always went out and built on the edge of town

29:39.872 --> 29:47.020
instead of trying to redevelop the inner city 
neighborhoods. And since a large part of her

29:47.961 --> 29:52.767
constituency was minority, she wanted to do 
something about inner city neighborhoods. And

29:54.189 --> 30:02.098
the thing that really convinced

29:54.189 --> 30:02.098
me was the fact that The development ordinance had 
just been passed, and she wanted someone to begin

30:02.787 --> 30:08.812
to implement the development ordinance, which 
are the first set of development controls. And so I

30:09.913 --> 30:14.036
agreed to take the job, so I came to work here on the 
1st of March. Afterwards, I found out that what had

30:14.817 --> 30:32.592
happened is Kathy had gone down to San Antonio 
shortly after her election and spent four days

30:14.817 --> 30:32.592
down there going over the projects that the San 
Antonio Development Agency, the redevelopment

30:14.817 --> 30:32.592
projects that the San Antonio Development Agency 
was doing, and looking at that, and then had asked

30:14.817 --> 30:32.592
Henry Cisneros to recommend someone that could 
come from San Antonio Hill to do the same type of

30:32.825 --> 30:36.331
work, and that he had recommended me. I didn't know 
what prompted the call for my resume. I found that

30:39.617 --> 30:40.498
out later. Interesting. Very interesting. So 
this is quite a change, then, in terms of the

30:43.864 --> 30:50.355
structure of the Planning and Development 
Department. Its name has changed, the structure

30:50.816 --> 30:58.208
of it has changed, you have added 
responsibilities now, and I understand that the

30:59.200 --> 31:07.210
support, the decision-making support for the 
planning function is much stronger than it used to

30:59.200 --> 31:07.210
be. Yes. What has happened, first of all, in 
numbers, the department has gone from 62 to 150.

31:16.562 --> 31:18.124
How long did it take to do that? It took about three 
years. Because we did it gradually. Secondly,

31:23.230 --> 31:28.937
the management structure has been changed 
completely. One of the big problems that I found

31:31.064 --> 31:39.191
when I arrived here was that the planning director 
was isolated. He had one secretary, and that was

31:39.451 --> 31:44.616
the entire set of his staff. Then everything was 
done at the division level. There was no assistant

31:47.138 --> 31:48.199
director. That position had been vacant for 
several months. And there was a division manager

31:51.382 --> 31:59.008
that was functioning as the Kerry Gilbert was 
functioning as the Assistant Director, and then,

31:59.832 --> 32:09.581
of course, once my appointment was announced, 
which was about a two or three month period, then

31:59.832 --> 32:09.581
the prior director left. And so there was a gap. 
Roscoe left. Roscoe left. He was on leave,

32:13.104 --> 32:16.428
actually, but he left. And so that Kerry was 
running the department when I got here. And I found

32:19.891 --> 32:27.578
myself very severely handicapped initially with 
a lack of an administrative support staffer for

32:19.891 --> 32:27.578
the director. It was myself and the secretary, and 
that was it. And the next step down was operating

32:30.765 --> 32:33.609
divisions. For a city like Houston. Yes. And when I 
asked the reason for this, I don't want to talk

32:38.375 --> 32:50.471
about someone else, but I was told that someone 
that only got three or four phone calls a week, that

32:38.375 --> 32:50.471
was sufficient staff to support him. And so the... 
And as I began expanding the department, I did not

32:54.743 --> 32:59.752
want to initially start building my staff. So it 
was a very difficult and slow process to get the

33:00.212 --> 33:04.319
adequate support staff. But now we have a 
well-organized, what I think is actually I think

33:04.340 --> 33:14.056
the ideal organization for a planning department 
in the country. Because we not only have the means

33:14.798 --> 33:19.165
of preparing plans, But we also have the means of 
implementing those. We have charge of the

33:22.001 --> 33:25.045
Community Development Block Grant Program and 
that budget. I'm a member of the CIP committee that

33:25.906 --> 33:30.371
selects the CIP projects. I am in charge of a 
committee that we call the Joint Referral

33:31.512 --> 33:46.249
Committee that handles all matters that relate to 
more than one department of the city. the Public

33:46.465 --> 33:51.151
Works Department, the Traffic and 
Transportation and Real Estate Department.

33:51.372 --> 34:02.627
Those are usually matters dealing with real 
estate, streets, acquisition, closing of

33:51.372 --> 34:02.627
streets, and selling of city property, and so 
forth, and acquiring city property. Do you have

34:03.027 --> 34:08.254
anything to do with the annual budget, aside from 
the departmental budget? The only annual budget

34:09.348 --> 34:13.814
that we deal with is the annual budget for 
community development. That's a $20 to $25

34:14.275 --> 34:19.683
million budget that we prepare entirely here in 
the department. But other than that, I only

34:20.524 --> 34:36.587
participate indirectly in the annual budget in 
that as part of the CIP committee, we then select

34:20.524 --> 34:36.587
the projects that need to be done that indirectly 
then establish a requirement for bond sales which

34:36.719 --> 34:42.150
then established the requirement for debt 
service in that particular year's bond issue. And

34:42.851 --> 34:54.734
now in the period of shortfall, that has become a 
rather important aspect of planning, that

34:42.851 --> 34:54.734
securing and selecting the right projects. 
Because we're looking now at projects, for

34:54.875 --> 34:59.183
example, that do not require staffing after 
they're constructed. So we're deferring, let's

35:03.226 --> 35:07.790
say, a multi-service center as opposed to 
building streets. We can build streets, and those

35:07.810 --> 35:12.734
don't require any additional maintenance or 
staffing. But if we built a multi-service center,

35:12.774 --> 35:16.818
then we would have to hire the people to staff it. 
And that would increase the operating costs,

35:16.838 --> 35:21.562
would then add to the budget. So we do those type of 
decisions, but I do it as part of the CIP committee

35:21.602 --> 35:26.086
rather than. And the CIP committee is composed of 
the director of public works, director of

35:26.427 --> 35:30.250
finance, myself, and the representative of the 
mayor's office. So it's a fairly small, powerful

35:34.576 --> 35:38.201
committee. Yes. And historically, we're in the 
third year of our CIP program. It started the first

35:44.589 --> 35:46.051
year that I got here. And we have succeeded in 
getting the city council to approve the CIP

35:47.173 --> 35:55.764
prepared by this committee with only very, very 
minor changes. And I think last year there was only

35:55.824 --> 35:58.448
one project that was changed. Even though we have 
abandoned the prior system in Houston of dividing

35:59.221 --> 36:14.363
capital improvements to each council district, 
whether they needed them or not, everybody got

35:59.221 --> 36:14.363
their fair share. And now we're using a priority 
system, which means that last year, for example,

36:15.064 --> 36:25.920
on this current bond issue, one district got 28% of 
the money. and one district got 5% of the money.

36:28.822 --> 36:32.387
That disparity, and yet the city council approved 
the plan unanimously. So they have basically

36:33.308 --> 36:37.334
bought our process as being a good process. That's 
quite a change from previous years. Ephraim,

36:44.103 --> 36:50.912
recently you've been taking a little political 
heat. And I understand you've written an article

36:51.702 --> 36:55.907
that appeared in the Houston Business News? That 
was an interview. An interview. And I understand

37:00.072 --> 37:06.780
it was quite a good article that was published, and 
I'd like to pick up a copy of that. Would you like to

37:08.382 --> 37:16.351
comment on how this political heat was generated, 
and by whom, and how you're responding to it? Well,

37:16.371 --> 37:19.735
the political heat had to do with the Community 
Development Block Grant Program. What I did is, in

37:21.166 --> 37:32.882
October of 84,

37:21.166 --> 37:32.882
the last major element that was added to the 
department was the community development

37:21.166 --> 37:32.882
division. And Houston has had a troubled 
community development program. And when I took

37:36.827 --> 37:37.828
over... It was not only troubled, but there was 
some... Scandal, and there's been some

37:37.989 --> 37:46.380
convictions, and so forth. And so I was handed a 
program that had a backlog of $90 million of

37:48.048 --> 37:56.737
unspent money, primarily in capital 
improvements projects. And from that date,

37:56.758 --> 38:01.503
October 84, when I took over the program, there was 
$1 million of construction. To date, we have been

38:02.484 --> 38:08.310
able to construct $52 million worth of projects. 
And that involved having to go out and engineer,

38:08.891 --> 38:14.937
design projects, and get them built. So we've made 
considerable progress over these last two years.

38:18.085 --> 38:30.901
Unfortunately, the Department of Housing and 
Urban Development chose this year, when all the

38:18.085 --> 38:30.901
progress is finally occurring, to penalize 
Houston for the prior 12 years of malfeasance and

38:18.085 --> 38:30.901
mismanagement. And so that's caused a political 
problem, because the implication is, even though

38:30.921 --> 38:40.954
HUD is saying, we're doing this because in all the 
12 years of the history of the program, Houston has

38:30.921 --> 38:40.954
never spent their full share of money, this is the 
year they decided to do something about it. And so

38:47.322 --> 39:01.158
the impression that has been left with some of the 
council members and what the media has given

38:47.322 --> 39:01.158
everyone is that mismanagement is still 
occurring in the system, even though all the HUD

38:47.322 --> 39:01.158
reports now indicate that we're doing well. And 
the mayor and I have been meeting with the HUD

39:02.539 --> 39:07.144
people trying to have them overturn that penalty, 
which was they penalized us by taking $2.6 million

39:08.525 --> 39:14.993
of our community development block. The 
impression the media gives is that the planning

39:16.054 --> 39:23.764
department is sitting on their hands and not 
spending the money that they have available. No,

39:24.645 --> 39:25.986
the money is being spent. In fact, this year HUD 
established a goal of $37 million for us to spend,

39:26.006 --> 39:37.080
which is almost twice of our annual allocation, 
and we actually will spend over $40 million. and

39:37.685 --> 39:40.048
we'll exceed the HUD goal by $3 million. And that is 
the argument we're making to HUD, is we're

39:40.068 --> 39:43.193
exceeding the goal. Why penalize, why select this 
year to be the penalty year? And of course, they're

39:48.561 --> 39:55.972
pointing out the fact that for 12 years, they have 
been given priority goals, and they have never

39:48.561 --> 39:55.972
been met. And they have got to understand that the 
structure has changed now. Well, and just

40:00.558 --> 40:05.886
yesterday, I received the annual monitoring 
report, and they compliment us on all the

40:06.457 --> 40:08.299
management changes and et cetera. But of course, 
they're sticking to their decision to take the

40:09.661 --> 40:18.232
$2.6 million as justified because they could have 
taken as much as $10 to $20 million if they had

40:09.661 --> 40:18.232
implemented that several years ago. So they're 
telling us, you're lucky that we didn't do it then

40:18.252 --> 40:22.818
and waited till now because we only took $2.6. But 
that's cause for some bad relations with city

40:25.341 --> 40:30.788
council members because they don't understand 
the situation. So they want to know from you why it

40:30.808 --> 40:33.692
hasn't been spent. Right. But you can give them 
answers. Do they seem to be understanding this?

40:42.259 --> 40:56.959
Well,

40:42.259 --> 40:56.959
the form of government here in Houston is almost 
identical to the federal system. You have the

40:57.680 --> 40:59.883
mayor, who represents the administration. She 
appoints the department directors. And then you

41:02.727 --> 41:07.834
have the city council, which sits there as the 
legislative body and is continuously at ends with

41:08.050 --> 41:12.015
the mayor, at odds with the mayor. And so 
therefore, even though the council members

41:12.035 --> 41:21.147
understand, they still make out like they don't 
understand because they get at the mayor by

41:12.035 --> 41:21.147
criticizing her department directors. So 
they're always on the directors, department

41:21.928 --> 41:25.633
heads. They're always on the department heads 
because that's the only way they can attack the

41:25.794 --> 41:28.677
mayor. So whatever you do... you know that 
whatever item you have on the agenda that you're

41:32.536 --> 41:37.163
going to be brought up there, you're going to be 
criticized. And a good example is the MetroCom

41:38.224 --> 41:41.289
computer system. See, the MetroCom computer 
system, among other things, has a complete map for

41:43.652 --> 41:48.559
the city of Houston. It's a graphic. It's billions 
of bytes of data. That's housed here in this

41:54.147 --> 41:55.590
building? Yes. And what we have is... that the maps 
that we put in there, while the Monumentation

42:01.713 --> 42:10.966
Mapping Program that cost the city $2 million was 
done in 1980, 1980 to 82. So the maps that we have

42:12.047 --> 42:18.776
inputted into the computer system are 1980 to 82 
maps. They are the most current maps available.

42:22.721 --> 42:25.645
Yet they like to say, well, the metric system isn't 
worth anything. All the data in there is five years

42:25.766 --> 42:29.070
old. it's five years old because the maps are five 
years old. And whenever a new monumentation

42:32.435 --> 42:45.070
mapping program takes place, and that normally is 
done every 10, 15, or 20 years, when the Corps of

42:32.435 --> 42:45.070
Engineers and the Geodetic Survey and the city get 
together to redo it, at that time we'll be able to

42:32.435 --> 42:45.070
update it. In the meantime, we're trying to 
correct and keep those maps current. But still,

42:48.514 --> 42:51.277
the base data is 1982 data. And so they keep 
criticizing the system for being five years out of

42:52.058 --> 42:57.344
date, when actually it's as current as it can be. 
And no matter how much you tell them that, Every

43:00.016 --> 43:08.586
time an item comes up on the agenda for the Metricom 
system, I still have to go up there and tell them why

43:00.016 --> 43:08.586
I'm putting money into a system that's five years 
out of date. Tough, tough, tough. Well, who built

43:14.633 --> 43:16.055
the Metricom system? The Metricom system is the 
originator of the system is Cinercom

43:16.796 --> 43:27.188
Corporation, which is a Houston corporation. Oh, 
mm-hmm. And right now they have six or seven cities

43:28.079 --> 43:41.060
in the country, Long Beach, Indianapolis, 
Wichita Falls, several cities that use this

43:28.079 --> 43:41.060
system. We bought the system. The city has $24 
million invested in it. And just to give you an

43:46.489 --> 43:53.580
example of the way the council functions, last 
week I had a $10,000 maintenance contract on the

43:46.489 --> 43:53.580
agenda. $10,000 maintenance contract. And I have 
to go in there and answer to them why we don't junk

43:56.226 --> 44:04.278
the $24 million system and why they should approve 
the $10,000 to keep the system going. Democracy at

44:04.538 --> 44:07.042
work. But what it does is it has a complete database 
of the city from a mapping property and facilities

44:07.062 --> 44:19.039
point of view. The facilities that we have in there 
are all the streets, the paving sections,

44:19.059 --> 44:23.365
sidewalks, curbs. The water lines, sewer lines. 
You have parcel data? Parcel data. In addition to

44:29.220 --> 44:39.838
that, our system is compatible with the Harris 
County Appraisal District, so they provide us all

44:29.220 --> 44:39.838
the latest data on bulk loading tape. So we have all 
that parcel and ownership information. And, of

44:43.484 --> 44:46.228
course, with regard to that data, we're current. 
We have the latest tack rolls in there. And the

44:50.058 --> 44:57.705
Public Works Department has about 20 people that 
they, every set of plans that is prepared, water

44:50.058 --> 44:57.705
lines, sewer lines, et cetera, is entered into the 
system. So you're current there. We're current

44:59.187 --> 44:59.888
there. The only thing we're doing is putting it on a 
map that is five years old. At that base, it's five

45:04.552 --> 45:05.873
years old. Can USGS give you interim updates? 
Well, what it involves, it involves two things. It

45:14.522 --> 45:19.727
involves the mapping, but actually it involves 
using aerial photography. correlated with the

45:20.467 --> 45:26.915
mapping, and they're using photogrammetry in 
order to make sure all the buildings and all the

45:20.467 --> 45:26.915
structures are in the current locations. So our 
plan eventually is to do one-third of the city

45:27.696 --> 45:31.300
every year. And for the database to become an 
income-producing database, it can be sold to

45:31.340 --> 45:44.216
other people who need to have information, and 
then the income generated from that would be

45:31.340 --> 45:44.216
reinvested in the system to make it 
self-sufficient. Well, I would think there would

45:44.236 --> 45:47.060
be a lot of users that would be willing to pay for 
that. Well, we have an advantage here that... Some

45:50.588 --> 45:54.134
of the utilities are also in the same system that we 
have. The gas company and the electric company,

45:54.554 --> 46:06.294
HLMP and Intex, both use the same mapping system so 
that we, in effect, can interchange data and pass

45:54.554 --> 46:06.294
data back and forth. Also, Stewart Title Company, 
which is a company that is contracted to do the work

46:07.095 --> 46:15.128
for the appraisal district, using the same 
mapping system, and so does Fort Bend County, and

46:16.323 --> 46:27.055
our city limits extend into Fort Bend County, so 
that we have a common base that we can work with.

46:27.075 --> 46:28.737
Down by Missouri City in that area? Yes, sir. Well, 
that sounds very interesting in terms of your

46:30.759 --> 46:33.102
mapping. And, of course, then you can call up on the 
system anything that comes up on the agenda. You

46:40.410 --> 46:43.173
can take a quick look at it and get the... Yes, we... 
Of course, the system right now is used, for

46:45.517 --> 46:49.743
example, down at building permits. When a person 
comes in for a building permit, they will pull up

46:49.803 --> 46:58.634
the parcel with all the ownership data to make sure 
that the right person is applying for the building

46:49.803 --> 46:58.634
permit, what is there now, et cetera. But we also 
have a lot of other uses. Although we're expanding

47:00.276 --> 47:07.626
the database, since the planning department 
wasn't involved in the initial planning of it, a

47:00.276 --> 47:07.626
lot of data that we would...
