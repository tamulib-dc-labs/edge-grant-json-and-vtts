00:02.647 --> 00:18.127
with Mr. Evans on the 11th of April, 1999, the anniversary of the first shots at Fort Sumter that started the Civil War in 1861.

00:20.190 --> 00:22.493
Happened to read the paper today.

00:24.516 --> 00:31.725
The weather outside in Bracketville today is cloudy, but on the inside is bright and sunny.

00:32.600 --> 00:34.683
Let's see.

00:35.124 --> 00:46.181
We were chatting about the beginning of your agricultural work and your ranching.

00:47.523 --> 00:52.431
When did you first go into the land business for yourself?

01:04.763 --> 01:12.099
I knew very well.

01:12.119 --> 01:12.461
He never met him.

01:12.481 --> 01:13.727
He called me up to tell him that the Brown Brothers loved him.

01:36.151 --> 02:02.293
five dollars an acre

02:05.108 --> 02:06.471
Now you say the Brown brothers.

02:06.531 --> 02:12.302
Is this Herman and George Brown in Houston?

02:12.322 --> 02:13.624
How long had you known them?

02:25.768 --> 02:25.868
Hmm.

03:11.073 --> 03:19.007
That land up in the panhandle, did it by chance have any oil underneath it?

03:58.289 --> 03:59.676
Come on up, Brad.

04:39.025 --> 04:42.438
Similarly.

04:42.458 --> 04:42.640
InÅŸallah.

06:57.957 --> 07:04.641
Wow, that's good.

07:05.163 --> 07:07.652
Thirteen years, never fail to make a profit.

07:08.636 --> 07:09.840
And what were you growing?

07:44.009 --> 07:46.189
Now, your favorite cattle are red.

09:14.813 --> 09:17.822
Now you've been both in ranching and farming.

09:19.547 --> 09:21.713
What was your favorite crop?

09:22.817 --> 09:25.043
Which crop did you enjoy growing most?

10:45.314 --> 11:12.216
Tony.

13:17.071 --> 13:21.867
Now, when did you acquire the Nine Bar Ranch?

13:21.887 --> 13:22.369
What year?

13:22.730 --> 13:23.212
What time?

13:23.232 --> 13:25.299
1950?

13:28.951 --> 13:30.135
And kept it how long?

13:51.968 --> 14:15.613
He said, I don't do that by his name.

14:15.633 --> 14:16.314
He said, if you'll take that land.

14:16.334 --> 14:16.675
I took that land.

14:16.695 --> 14:17.015
I worked it out.

14:17.035 --> 14:17.455
I had it by the band.

14:17.475 --> 14:17.756
Fixed a break.

14:17.776 --> 14:17.976
Beautiful.

14:37.295 --> 14:39.137
I knew that I didn't like it back then.

15:27.785 --> 15:49.740
He said, boy, I don't remember him.

15:49.760 --> 15:50.361
He got him, you know, from me.

15:50.381 --> 15:51.102
Oh, she said, man, the talented boy.

15:51.122 --> 15:51.843
He said, man, I forgot to have that.

15:51.863 --> 15:52.745
I don't know what to do, but that was a kid.

15:52.765 --> 15:52.965
He got the

16:24.147 --> 16:32.384
What were the joys of being in the farm and ranching business?

16:32.424 --> 16:43.607
What did you enjoy most?

18:07.861 --> 18:28.374
She accepted?

18:28.394 --> 18:28.474
Yes.

18:28.494 --> 18:28.674
Here, go.

18:28.695 --> 18:29.155
Go to the side one day.

18:29.175 --> 18:29.476
Please, please.

18:29.496 --> 18:29.836
Please, please.

18:29.856 --> 18:30.257
Please, please, too.

19:33.417 --> 19:35.766
Let's take a version of that one.

20:29.493 --> 20:53.172
A girl came around to get the order.

20:53.192 --> 20:54.093
I bet there were 50 white people in the area.

20:54.113 --> 20:54.834
Sir, I was saying, I didn't want it.

20:54.854 --> 20:55.255
He said, you got it?

20:55.275 --> 20:55.455
Yes, sir.

20:55.475 --> 20:55.956
One minute, we got back.

21:00.205 --> 21:24.877
in Chicago, New York.

21:24.897 --> 21:25.157
He's praying.

21:25.177 --> 21:25.498
He's coming out.

21:25.518 --> 21:25.838
He's coming out.

21:25.858 --> 21:26.178
He's coming out.

21:26.198 --> 21:26.519
He's coming out.

21:26.539 --> 21:26.859
He's coming out.

21:26.879 --> 21:27.200
He's coming out.

21:27.220 --> 21:27.540
He's coming out.

21:27.560 --> 21:27.881
He's coming out.

21:27.901 --> 21:28.221
He's coming out.

21:36.706 --> 21:38.295
Thank you.

23:18.580 --> 23:28.366
Soldiers in there.

23:28.386 --> 23:28.887
I'll make quite a minute.

23:28.907 --> 23:29.248
Give it a minute.

25:19.152 --> 25:46.864
If you were buying land today

25:48.160 --> 25:55.509
If I were buying land and came to you for advice, where would you tell me to look at land most closely?

25:55.949 --> 25:56.670
Where in Texas?

25:56.690 --> 26:17.495
That's a tough question.

26:17.515 --> 26:17.695
Out here?

26:19.565 --> 26:21.508
When did you buy this land?

27:00.419 --> 27:24.148
14,000 acres.

27:29.410 --> 27:40.406
Do you run cattle on it?

27:43.290 --> 27:43.590
Sheep?

27:45.874 --> 27:47.095
What kind of cattle?

27:47.115 --> 27:47.716
Santa Couture.

27:53.384 --> 27:53.865
Santa Couture.

29:31.298 --> 29:33.161
Let's go back to Texas A&M.

29:37.668 --> 29:44.458
You worked with President Gilchrist.

29:46.562 --> 29:53.813
Describe his accomplishments, his goals.

29:59.902 --> 30:25.943
in the highway department was he a big man physically who was it that's

30:26.547 --> 30:29.370
decided he was the one to bring to A&M.

30:29.390 --> 30:31.973
Do you know him?

30:31.993 --> 30:35.297
Because he came as dean of engineering and then became president.

30:42.184 --> 30:43.626
Was he easy to work with?

30:49.812 --> 30:54.057
Who was the executive director of the former students then?

30:57.580 --> 31:01.705
trying to remember who was leading the former students in those years.

31:03.347 --> 31:03.907
I don't either.

31:05.709 --> 31:08.753
And let's see.

31:09.153 --> 31:14.499
And Dr. Harrington was coming up on the faculty.

31:15.741 --> 31:25.312
Did you remain in connection with him after you finished as a student?

31:25.952 --> 31:26.473
And

31:27.770 --> 31:32.805
Did he and Ruth Harrington get married soon after his college days?

31:38.402 --> 31:41.070
She's still living there in Bryan.
