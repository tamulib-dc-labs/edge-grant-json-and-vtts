WEBVTT

00:02.697 --> 00:17.650
with Mr. Evans on the 11th of April, 1999, the 
anniversary of the first shots at Fort Sumter that

00:02.697 --> 00:17.650
started the Civil War in 1861.

00:20.212 --> 00:22.494
Happened to read the paper today. The weather 
outside in Brackettville today is cloudy, but on

00:22.534 --> 00:31.742
the inside is bright and sunny, Let's see. We were 
chatting about the beginning of your

00:35.136 --> 00:46.189
agricultural work and your ranching. When did you 
first go into the land business for yourself?

01:36.185 --> 02:02.175
five dollars an acre

02:05.142 --> 02:06.505
Now you say the Brown brothers. Is this Herman and 
George Brown in Houston?

02:12.337 --> 02:13.640
How long had you known them?

02:25.805 --> 02:25.885
Hmm.

02:49.152 --> 03:19.075
That

02:49.152 --> 03:19.075
land up in the panhandle, did

02:49.152 --> 03:19.075
it by chance have any oil underneath it?

04:39.903 --> 04:42.235
Five, six, seven, eight, nine, 10.

06:57.974 --> 07:04.671
Wow,

06:57.974 --> 07:04.671
that's good. 13 years, never failed to make a 
profit. And what were you growing?

07:44.043 --> 07:46.155
Now, your favorite cattle are red.

09:14.847 --> 09:17.876
Now you've been both in ranching and farming. What 
was your favorite crop? Which crop did you enjoy

09:22.851 --> 09:25.178
growing most?

09:49.677 --> 09:50.744
Thank you, man.

10:45.297 --> 11:12.385
Tony

10:45.297 --> 11:12.385
said, yeah.

13:17.105 --> 13:21.879
Now, when did you acquire the Nine Bar Ranch? What 
year? What time? 1950?

13:28.979 --> 13:30.102
And kept it how long?

13:52.120 --> 14:13.943
separate

13:52.120 --> 14:13.943
deal anytime they wanted it. Said I don't want to do 
that. I said, is it a transition? He said, if you'll

14:15.124 --> 14:16.205
take that land, we're over by then. I took that land 
and worked it out. Big house, antebellum house,

14:16.946 --> 14:18.027
Houston break, beautiful.

14:25.938 --> 14:42.185
They

14:25.938 --> 14:42.185
didn't know about it. They saw it there. I called 
everyone. I said, do you have a picture of the

14:42.966 --> 14:43.868
message? I knew, but I didn't like the picture, so I 
didn't take it. Somebody in New York, could you

14:45.090 --> 14:45.891
find it? She called me up a little bit.

15:27.886 --> 15:50.723
We

15:27.886 --> 15:50.723
got to have that. I don't know what to say.

16:24.164 --> 16:32.401
What

16:24.164 --> 16:32.401
were the joys of being in the farm and ranching 
business? What did you enjoy most?

16:42.622 --> 16:43.243
I used to make money out of it. I made some money.

18:07.844 --> 18:26.578
Six

18:07.844 --> 18:26.578
steps? Yes. Here we go. Go to that side one more 
time. That was it. I'm so proud of you for that. I'm

18:28.422 --> 18:29.003
so proud of you for that. I'm pleased with you. I'm 
happy. I got it. I'm pleased. Part two.

19:33.907 --> 19:35.192
Perfect, yeah.

20:54.839 --> 21:16.167
One

20:54.839 --> 21:16.167
of the men who got back to the kitchen, and there's 
that guy, kind of stuck in Chicago, New York, he's

20:54.839 --> 21:16.167
crying. So I come out there, anyway, and then Mr. 
Williams comes out of the thing, and Mr. Williams

21:16.187 --> 21:18.410
said, it's all him. He says, okay, then, he says, 
it's not you. I go, what? I go, tell him that.

21:27.003 --> 21:38.548
That's

21:27.003 --> 21:38.548
it.

23:18.783 --> 23:29.637
Give

23:18.783 --> 23:29.637
me the lamp.

25:19.203 --> 25:46.881
If

25:19.203 --> 25:46.881
you were buying land today, If I were buying land 
and came to you for advice, where would you tell me

25:48.194 --> 25:55.563
to look at land most closely? Where in Texas? 
That's

25:56.705 --> 26:17.512
a tough question. Out here? When did you buy this 
land?

27:00.470 --> 27:24.182
14,000

27:00.470 --> 27:24.182
acres.

27:30.052 --> 27:40.404
And

27:30.052 --> 27:40.404
do you run cattle on it? Sheep? What kind of cattle?

27:53.398 --> 27:53.899
Santa Cruz.

29:31.315 --> 29:33.178
Let's go back to Texas A&M.

29:37.707 --> 29:44.480
You worked with President Gilchrist.

29:46.603 --> 29:53.897
Describe his accomplishments, his goals.

29:59.935 --> 30:15.330
In the highway department.

30:15.350 --> 30:16.872
Was he a big man physically?

30:23.819 --> 30:26.061
Who was it that's... decided he was the one to bring 
to A&M. Do you know? Because he came as dean of

30:32.030 --> 30:35.314
engineering and then became president.

30:42.222 --> 30:43.643
Was he easy to work with?

30:49.850 --> 30:54.175
Who was the executive director of the former 
students then?

30:57.631 --> 31:01.736
trying to remember who was leading the former 
students in those years. I don't either. And let's

31:05.741 --> 31:09.165
see. And Dr. Harrington was coming up on the 
faculty. Did you remain in connection with him

31:15.752 --> 31:21.058
after you finished as a student?

31:25.223 --> 31:26.625
And... Did he and Ruth Harrington get married soon 
after his college days?

31:38.438 --> 31:41.087
She's still living there in Bryan.
