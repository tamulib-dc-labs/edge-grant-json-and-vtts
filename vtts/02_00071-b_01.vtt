With Mr. Evans on the 11th of April, 1999, the 
anniversary of the first shots at Fort Sumter that

00:13.400 --> 00:18.370
started the Civil War in 1861. Happened to read the 
paper today. The weather outside in

00:23.590 --> 00:27.970
Brackettville today is cloudy, but on the inside 
is bright and sunny. Let's see, we were chatting

00:32.470 --> 00:44.880
about the beginning of your agricultural work and 
your ranching. When did you first go into the land

00:47.100 --> 00:52.200
business for yourself?

01:36.020 --> 01:37.261
Five dollars an acre?

02:05.030 --> 02:06.451
Now you say the Brown brothers. Is this Herman and 
George Brown in Houston?

02:12.200 --> 02:13.641
How long had you known them?

03:11.130 --> 03:12.211
That land that... Up in the panhandle, did it by 
chance have any oil underneath it? Thirteen

03:19.400 --> 07:07.580
years, never failed to make a profit. And what were 
you growing? Now

07:10.300 --> 07:46.040
your favorite cattle are red.

09:14.820 --> 09:17.760
Now you've been both in ranching and farming. What 
was your favorite crop? Which crop did you enjoy

09:22.710 --> 09:24.950
growing most? Now

09:25.210 --> 13:21.530
when did you acquire the Nine Bar Ranch? What year? 
What time? 1950? And kept

13:25.240 --> 13:29.280
it how long? What

13:29.260 --> 16:32.200
were the joys of being in the farm and ranching 
business? What did you enjoy most? If

16:34.180 --> 25:46.270
you were buying land today, if I were buying land 
and came to you for advice, where would you tell me

25:50.750 --> 25:54.770
to look at land most closely? Where in Texas? Out

25:56.750 --> 26:17.636
here? When did you buy this land? 14,000

26:21.180 --> 27:24.230
acres. Okay. Do

27:24.330 --> 27:40.770
you run cattle on it? Sheep?

27:45.918 --> 27:48.050
What kind of cattle? Senator

27:48.030 --> 29:32.980
Gertrude. Let's go back to Texas A&M.

29:37.550 --> 29:42.330
You worked with President Gilchrist.

29:46.120 --> 30:15.280
Describe his accomplishments, his goals

29:46.120 --> 30:15.280
in the highway department.

30:15.260 --> 30:17.280
Was he a big man physically? Who

30:17.260 --> 30:29.250
was it that decided he was the one to bring to A&M? Do 
you know? Because he came as dean of engineering

30:30.230 --> 30:35.360
and then became president. Was

30:35.340 --> 30:49.550
he easy to work with?

30:49.530 --> 30:57.290
Who was the executive director of the former 
students then?

30:57.270 --> 31:02.290
Trying to remember who was leading the former 
students in those years. I don't either. And

31:05.220 --> 31:08.610
let's see. And Dr. Harrington was coming up on the 
faculty. Did you remain in connection with him

31:15.800 --> 31:25.460
after you finished as a student?

31:25.440 --> 31:38.280
And did he and Ruth Harrington get married soon 
after his college days?

31:38.260 --> 31:41.280
She's still living there in Bryan. . . . . . . . . . . . . .
