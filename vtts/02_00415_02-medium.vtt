WEBVTT

00:01.533 --> 00:08.101
My name is Cruz Sanchez.

00:10.244 --> 00:16.092
And this is the story of your life and your family. 
First, where were you born and in which part? In

00:24.262 --> 00:26.545
Mexico.

00:33.967 --> 00:36.431
General Treviño Nuevo León. ¿Y

00:36.451 --> 00:40.877
en qué año? En 1906, el día 3 de... El día

00:41.819 --> 00:49.871
3 de mayo. Pues dígame sobre su mamá y papá.

00:58.704 --> 01:02.590
Bueno, mi mamá... He came with me to the United 
States. My father told my mother that he died in

01:06.721 --> 01:13.528
Mexico. When I was four years old, I barely 
remember. In what year did he

01:17.591 --> 01:23.037
die? No, I don't know. But before his mother came to 
the United States. Yes, very early. How many

01:33.502 --> 01:36.185
children are in your family? How many children? 
How many children? Oh, in my family? Yes. There are

01:40.630 --> 01:41.711
three. Three? Only three? Yes. Who was the 
majority? Amelia, Amelia Sanchez. Yes. And then?

01:52.482 --> 01:55.505
Then, Concepcion Sanchez. Yes. And the baby, 
Antonio Sanchez. Yes. A man. A man? Yes. Two women

02:02.353 --> 02:02.833
and a man. But you? Yes, my family. Your family? 
Yes. And you are the youngest? Oh, from my mother's

02:13.162 --> 02:14.804
family? Yes. Oh, these are your children? Yes, 
they are my children. Oh, yes, I understand. My

02:19.891 --> 02:22.194
children. I ask about your mother and father's 
family first. Brothers. Yes, brothers. That's

02:29.965 --> 02:31.667
what you want to ask. Yes. Well,

02:33.678 --> 02:52.127
there are two sisters,

02:33.678 --> 02:52.127
women, and we are four men in the family. Yes. And I 
am the youngest. Yes. And your family lived in

02:57.395 --> 03:01.862
Mexico, in general? Yes, General Treviño. 
Treviño. And what town is near General Treviño,

03:06.856 --> 03:17.132
the biggest

03:06.856 --> 03:17.132
town? I don't remember very well, but I think it's 
Mierta Maulipas, I think. Yes. I think it's the

03:24.884 --> 03:26.246
closest. Yes. And what kind of work did your father 
have?

03:30.913 --> 03:31.714
Well...

03:34.529 --> 03:43.019
My mother said, many years ago, those people who 
lived...

03:43.320 --> 03:50.228
I think my father, his father...

03:50.248 --> 03:56.055
I think they were like little children, my 
grandfather. They traveled from one town to

03:56.075 --> 04:00.300
another. in burros with, I don't know, with 
merchandise that they were going to sell here to

04:00.635 --> 04:07.663
other towns. Yes? Your grandfather? My 
grandfather, I think. Yes. And in this general

04:12.009 --> 04:15.473
Trabiño, another town? No, it was when they were 
living, because my mother is from the state of San

04:16.134 --> 04:23.582
Luis Potosí. Yes. My father was from Monterrey. 
Yes, in the city. Yes, in the city. But I don't know

04:30.356 --> 04:34.021
where his father lived. Yes. It would be more to the 
other side of Monterrey.

04:42.392 --> 04:47.058
And he was in the merchandise. Merchandise in 
burros. My mother would tell him. I barely

04:51.604 --> 04:52.525
remember. Yes. Yes. And your father, what kind of 
work

04:55.208 --> 05:02.696
did he have? He was a bricklayer. He made houses 
with bricks. Ah, to make houses? Yes, to make the

05:13.687 --> 05:16.430
walls of the house. Ah, yes. Of stone. Yes. In 
Monterrey? Yes. And then in General Treviño? My

05:25.853 --> 05:37.865
mother used to tell me that when they moved to 
nearby beds to raise three children, he worked in a

05:25.853 --> 05:37.865
ranch. Yes. Planting, the work of the boss, I 
think. Yes. Yes. It was a ranch of another person.

05:48.034 --> 05:49.295
Yes, of another person.

05:51.978 --> 05:52.118
Yes. And your mother? Well, my mother was there. 
Yes. And after her father died, what did her mother

05:59.277 --> 06:05.785
do? Well, she worked to support us, the youngest 
ones who were at home. She worked. What kind of

06:15.316 --> 06:16.217
work? Well, in the kitchen, with other people. And 
this was in general travel? Yes, in general

06:26.205 --> 06:27.947
travel. For many years? Yes, but here we grew up a 
little bit. And

06:33.812 --> 06:38.476
then we came to the United States. I

06:38.577 --> 06:46.324
was about 15 years old when I came here. You were 15 
years old? Yes. And for what reason did your family

06:51.865 --> 06:59.132
come to the United States? To work, because you 
know very well that in Mexico it is very hard to earn

06:59.152 --> 07:06.180
a living for food. Yes, why? Because she was the 
only mother, you see? She had to work to keep us. And

07:13.167 --> 07:18.312
in what year? Yo vine la primera vez que no he vuelto 
a ir para atrás con el hermano mayor. Fue en 1918.

07:28.226 --> 07:32.734
Pasamos aquí a Estados Unidos. Aquí el condado no 
es. ¿En qué clase de, pues, en qué modo venían a los

07:35.478 --> 07:42.370
Estados Unidos? Para trabajar, dijiste. By train 
or what? By train. Before that, there was a train

07:47.783 --> 07:54.412
here from Robes Town to Pérguit del Valle. Ah, yes, 
from Robes Town. From which part of Mexico? From

08:00.401 --> 08:01.823
General Treviño? Well, when did you leave Mexico? 
Did you go through the border? In what way? Well, In

08:13.304 --> 08:13.945
Rome? In Rome, Texas? Yes. That's where we crossed 
over to this side? Yes, in Rome. And then where?

08:21.735 --> 08:24.659
When we arrived here? Yes. From Rome, we came here 
to a town where the train arrived, to Sanfordais,

08:24.859 --> 08:37.236
Texas. I don't remember very well, but he was 
retired from Rome. And that's where the train was

08:43.292 --> 08:46.196
coming from. I don't know where it was coming from, 
but it was coming from here. From there we came to

08:56.532 --> 09:06.447
Driscoll, a town about 20 miles away. And from 
there we went to Petronila, a ranch close by. I

09:10.364 --> 09:14.328
don't remember exactly, but it was about 10 miles 
away, I think. Yes. That's where we got to that

09:15.109 --> 09:18.613
ranch. The Piscara Algodón.

09:23.459 --> 09:26.042
Yes. And does everyone work in your family? Your 
brothers? Well, my brother worked. The one who

09:33.190 --> 09:35.072
lives here. Yes. And the older brother. The other 
one was old. He didn't look. No? No. He played the

09:43.529 --> 09:46.615
guitar. That's what

09:46.976 --> 09:51.865
he did. And you? I was very young. When there was 
cotton, we would play. That was all I did. Yes, you

10:00.511 --> 10:03.615
were 15 years old. Yes, I was about 15 years old when 
we came here to Petronilla. And in Mexico, are

10:09.944 --> 10:16.873
there problems with the war in these days? Well, I 
think so. I heard that there was war, fighting with

10:18.135 --> 10:28.189
each other, the same brothers, the same children 
from Mexico. And war is not the reason for

10:29.536 --> 10:37.027
your family? No, I don't think so. No. There are no 
problems for your family with war? No. Why not?

10:48.944 --> 10:52.229
Well, I don't know. I can't understand if there are 
problems between families.

11:00.974 --> 11:09.987
Because among the families we were four men and two 
women.

11:15.555 --> 11:24.248
In these days in Mexico, what kind of things do you 
remember about your home? What kind of house did

11:25.477 --> 11:30.405
your family have there? Well, it was a very poor 
house. I barely remember. A very poor house.

11:38.157 --> 11:40.561
Because your mother was there? Yes, she was the 
only one who worked there. And the town was very big

11:50.283 --> 11:53.688
or small? No, it was a small town. They say that now 
it's very big. I haven't gone back. Since 1918 I

12:01.320 --> 12:03.062
haven't gone back. No? You've never visited 
Mexico? No, ma'am. Why

12:09.031 --> 12:12.737
not? No, I've never gone back. I haven't visited. 
No. Never. Do you want to visit? Well, if I had a

12:21.685 --> 12:25.829
chance one day, I could go, but who knows? I'm 
already very

12:25.849 --> 12:30.294
old. Is life very different here in Mexico? Oh, 
yes. Some people who come from there tell me that

12:35.980 --> 12:41.105
it's very hard to work there. They pay a lot of money 
a day. Yes. About 30 or 40 pesos. 30 or 40 pesos, 45.

12:50.331 --> 13:01.028
But

12:50.331 --> 13:01.028
they almost tell me that with the 30 pesos they earn 
in one day, they don't have anything to eat. One

13:02.010 --> 13:02.490
day.

13:05.996 --> 13:07.518
Because everything is very expensive. Yes. They 
tell me that everything is very expensive. The

13:13.007 --> 13:14.830
merchandise... to eat and all that, clothes

13:15.417 --> 13:21.144
and everything. Once I was told by a man who was 
working here that a pair of shoes... Who's like

13:21.184 --> 13:32.398
these? Yes. They cost 400 pesos. Yes. It's pretty 
expensive.

13:40.969 --> 13:42.011
Like a person who has... I want some... three of the 
family. You can't buy shoes for every boy or girl.

13:55.832 --> 14:05.244
You can buy them, but I'm sure that in a week they 
won't have food for the family. Yes. Is it better

14:07.387 --> 14:08.188
here? It's easier to live here. It's easier to live 
here, it's lighter. Yes. For a family that has

14:16.197 --> 14:23.229
three or four families, it's much lighter here. 
And

14:23.249 --> 14:30.961
this is the reason why you don't want to live in 
Mexico or other places? Well, I would like to just

14:30.981 --> 14:37.332
go for a walk, not to live. I've spent most of my life 
here. And if I leave now, since I'm old, where am I

14:40.882 --> 14:47.488
going to work? I don't know how to work there. And 
here, well, the time I've been

14:51.612 --> 15:06.745
working here with this lady, with all the families 
of God, I can do any construction work. Any. Not

15:15.136 --> 15:23.908
very well, but I understand the work. And you also 
had a family. In what year did you get married? I got

15:34.201 --> 15:36.985
married in 1928. Yes. And where was your wife from? 
My wife? Yes. Well, when... When I saw her for the

15:47.811 --> 15:57.520
first time, I lived here for about a year, a year and 
a half, around 1944. I lived here. And I lived here.

16:02.504 --> 16:02.584
Yes. When I met her for the first time, My wife. In 
what way is it possible to meet her? Well...

16:20.946 --> 16:22.188
I was already old. I don't remember how old I was. 
But more

16:25.172 --> 16:36.807
or less, I was about... 19 or 20

16:25.172 --> 16:36.807
years old. In the dance. Yes. There are many dances 
here. Oh yes. We met for the first time in the dance.

16:53.402 --> 16:53.562
Yes. I came to the dance too, and so did I. We made a 
relationship.

17:02.414 --> 17:05.258
We got married in a short time. And you have three 
children? Yes, three children. And most of them

17:10.374 --> 17:13.636
are called? Amelia. Amelia. Amelia Sanchez. And 
Amelia is married? Yes, she is married. And

17:20.042 --> 17:24.146
Concepcion Sanchez is the second. And Antonio 
Sanchez is the youngest.

17:30.952 --> 17:31.312
Yes. He is married too. Also? The three of them are 
married? Yes, they are married. The eldest one

17:36.052 --> 17:38.514
lives here in Petronilla. Yes. And the second one 
lives in Por la Vaca. Yes. And Antonio lives here in

17:43.559 --> 17:45.621
Corpus. In Corpus? Yes. And what kind of work does 
your son have? He works as a mechanic.

17:58.033 --> 17:58.713
Yes. And he has a school and everything. How old is 
he? It took him a year to finish the whole big school

18:03.271 --> 18:10.000
here in Robstown. Yes. But since he was very young, 
he started working at a gas station here. Yes. When

18:19.592 --> 18:26.962
I left school, I came and worked until about 10 or 11 
at night. Yes. Helping there, selling gasoline

18:27.283 --> 18:31.388
and other tires that accompanied. And after that, 
he liked that job and he needed a year to finish

18:33.680 --> 18:42.513
school. And then, he was sent to the service, to the 
army. And that's it. There, he finished the school

18:54.050 --> 18:58.716
that the government gave him. Ah, yes. And he 
studied mechanics there too. And when he came, he

19:03.397 --> 19:08.665
continued to work in the same garage.

19:11.629 --> 19:12.791
Here in Clarewood. Yes. And soon after, the boss 
couldn't work there anymore because he owed a lot.

19:18.580 --> 19:24.849
And then he passed it on to him in the middle. Yes. so 
that Antonio could make payments for what he owed

19:26.363 --> 19:36.252
to the paper company and other things, to other 
iron companies that he bought to make the car. Yes.

19:36.452 --> 19:50.005
Well, Antonio gathered all the money and made a 
payment there, another payment to another

19:36.452 --> 19:50.005
company, until he paid everything that the boss 
owed him. Yes. Then he bought everything from the

19:50.325 --> 19:53.608
boss. Everything he had inside the farm.

19:58.882 --> 20:07.612
And the husbands of your daughters, what kind of 
work do they have? Antonio's

20:08.993 --> 20:23.590
wife... ...was working for about a year, 
recently, in a clothing store. And she left. She

20:26.164 --> 20:27.005
left work. Now she's studying at school. I don't 
know why she's studying there. She goes there in

20:35.933 --> 20:37.614
the morning. I think it's like 2 in the afternoon. 
At school, studying. All day? I don't know why

20:45.421 --> 20:48.944
she's studying. Maybe she's going to get a job in a 
store or something else. Do you think that studies

20:54.856 --> 20:59.503
are a good thing? Yes, sure. Why is it good? What? 
Studies. Why are studies good? Well, because if

21:09.798 --> 21:19.633
you know more, one day you can get a job where you can 
earn more money. Ah, yes? Is that true? It's true.

21:23.699 --> 21:24.019
It's true. Because right now, a boy who doesn't 
finish school, goes to a company to look for a

21:25.518 --> 21:36.469
job. The first thing they ask him, the boss there 
tells him, do you have your diploma? Yes. That's

21:48.401 --> 21:49.582
the first thing they ask him. Yes. She doesn't ask 
him if he wants to work. She asks him, do you have

21:55.033 --> 21:58.757
your diploma? So I think the man can say, well, 
there is work.

22:06.247 --> 22:09.572
For this reason, it is necessary to study. And the 
husband of your other daughter, what kind of work?

22:15.039 --> 22:16.661
What kind of work did he have? The one in the middle. 
He works in a school. Yes. In Buenavaca. A school?

22:25.429 --> 22:26.331
Is he a teacher? No, no, no. A teacher? No, no, no. 
He's not a teacher. When the children leave the

22:30.837 --> 22:34.422
school, he cleans them. Oh, yes. The inside, the 
floor, the walls, the floors, and all that. Yes.

22:42.052 --> 22:42.993
That's the work he does.

22:46.077 --> 22:49.542
And is he from Texas, or from which part? Who? 
Lucas? Yes. He's from here in the United States.

22:53.400 --> 22:55.082
He's from the United States? Yes. Is he the husband 
of your other daughter? The older one? Yes. He

23:00.847 --> 23:01.948
works in a ranch. Yes. Here in Petronila.

23:07.574 --> 23:07.694
Yes. He's worked there almost all his life because 
his father is a mayor of that ranch. He has...

23:20.234 --> 23:31.450
I have known the father of my son-in-law who lives 
in Petronila since 1918. When did you get married?

23:33.633 --> 23:33.873
Yes. I knew the mother of my son-in-law, also a 
lady. Ah. Since 1918. Friends for many years. Many

23:43.066 --> 23:43.667
years. Yes. Well, I got married, your family, he 
got married, your family, my nephew.

23:55.536 --> 24:01.548
And then, from here in Petronila, he came to a ranch 
here at the airport. It was a very big ranch there.

24:04.328 --> 24:06.911
He was also in Mayoloma with that same boss. And 
this boy, the husband of my girlfriend, she was

24:06.931 --> 24:14.321
already old and they came here to school. My 
girlfriend was also at school. And there they got

24:16.724 --> 24:19.768
married. How beautiful. It's a good thing. With 
families who are together and get married. Yes.

24:31.227 --> 24:35.072
We've known each other for many years. Me and his 
father. Is his father from Mexico or from here? No,

24:40.039 --> 24:42.463
he's from the United States. He's from the United 
States. For the rest of his life? Yes. He's the

24:48.351 --> 24:50.154
mayor of that ranch. He's been the mayor for many 
years. Before 1918? Yes. Before 1918. Yes,

24:59.965 --> 25:02.147
because I was there in 1918. In 1919, with the 
churrasco here in Corpus. Yes. I don't know if you

25:09.995 --> 25:14.739
remember, but have you read in the books? Yes. I 
think it was the first one, I think. Churrasco.

25:20.985 --> 25:21.406
Yes. Stone. Stone. Like a hurricane? No. No. 
Different. What kind of stone? Well, it's a lot of

25:29.547 --> 25:32.690
air, very strong. Yes. Very strong. But it was 
different from a hurricane. A hurricane. A

25:39.378 --> 25:40.879
hurricane is different. It's a kind of, how do you 
say storm? Tornado. Tornado? Yes. Yes. It's a

25:49.388 --> 25:53.072
hurricane, pure air. Yes. It was in 1919.

25:56.796 --> 25:57.597
Well, like... In about a month or two months, I came 
here with my family. My eldest father, from the

26:06.684 --> 26:09.328
whole family. From this family here in this ranch? 
Yes. He lived there in that big house. Yes. So I'm

26:17.999 --> 26:21.223
here with them, in the same family, working here. 
Was this your first job here in the United States?

26:25.288 --> 26:28.512
My first job here, yes. I was a kid here in 
Petronila, picking cotton. Yes. I was very young.

26:34.019 --> 26:34.139
Yes. And when I came here to work with the uncle, we 
called him uncle. All the people call him uncle,

26:37.264 --> 26:39.867
uncle. That's the father. This big father. The big 
father. Everyone calls him uncle. Uncle Oro.

26:46.377 --> 26:46.637
Uncle Oro. Well, where we are right now, there were 
no houses here, nothing. No? Nothing, nothing.

26:54.828 --> 26:55.950
Only his house. There was a shed where they had a lot 
of cows and mules, horses, to work the land,

26:58.208 --> 27:11.207
because in those years they worked with pure 
beasts, horses, the land. Here in this place where

27:11.227 --> 27:16.935
we are, it was a pure mountain. And here, Juan Deíce 
gave the first job, taking out... Taking out the

27:24.866 --> 27:25.988
mountain. taking out the mountain with a 
sledgehammer. With a sledgehammer? Yes. I was

27:33.050 --> 27:38.035
looking at my hands with some water balls here. Oh! 
I was working like this, taking out the trees. Yes.

27:45.001 --> 27:49.365
But I was very young, I was about 15, like 15 and a 
half years old. Yes. And in the afternoon I was

27:51.427 --> 27:56.211
looking at my hands here with some water balls. Ay. 
What a job. It was the first job I did here. Yes. Here

28:05.640 --> 28:09.464
in this little piece, we are talking right now. And 
there are many trees here these days. Big or small?

28:13.669 --> 28:14.209
Big. And small, big mosques and all that. Mosques, 
everything. Everything. It's a pure mountain

28:19.555 --> 28:21.858
here. A mountain, a big mountain. This is the 
Hawaii that goes here in 44. Yes. It was pure land.

28:29.648 --> 28:29.929
Pure land. It was pure land, just raised like that. 
Back then there were a lot of guayines, bogues,

28:33.373 --> 28:38.099
carts. There weren't many carts. Yes? There 
weren't many at that time. Well, after the

28:45.788 --> 28:56.421
elimination of the mountain and the fields, what 
kind of crops? To plant cotton. Cotton. And corn.

29:03.131 --> 29:03.672
And corn too. This seed that they plant now, they 
didn't plant it to sell it like they sell it now.

29:09.980 --> 29:10.060
Yes. They only used it for mules and horses. Yes. 
That was all. But they didn't sell it. There were no

29:18.532 --> 29:24.079
factories where they bought that seed. And were 
there many families that lived here on this ranch?

29:32.156 --> 29:33.460
Oh yes, many. How many more or less? I think there 
were about ten families. Ten families? Almost a

29:43.011 --> 29:44.133
small town. Yes, almost a small town. All that land 
that you see on the other side of the house, the old

29:45.294 --> 29:56.749
man's house, there are only houses for the people 
who lived here, who worked here, in the works here.

29:56.769 --> 29:58.932
Yes, on the other side of the road. On the other side 
of the road. Yes. And these houses were made of

30:02.336 --> 30:05.220
wood? Yes, made of wood. Yes, with light and things 
like this? No, ma'am, at that time there was no

30:13.388 --> 30:17.935
light. No? Just a third-person lamp. Yes? It was 
everything. And how many fours did you have in

30:21.200 --> 30:23.384
these houses? Well, there were some that had a 
little room. Yes? There was another one that had

30:28.792 --> 30:30.415
two. A small table like this, just standing. The 
door, to go to the other room, everything. The

30:39.866 --> 30:42.891
floor, just a table like this. Everything. Who 
made these houses? Well, there were... I don't

30:49.641 --> 30:57.853
remember, but when I came here, those houses were 
already made. When I was 10 years old, I lived here.

31:12.271 --> 31:16.776
My uncle

31:12.271 --> 31:16.776
was a carpenter. He was going to build another 
house. I think they came from Corpo. I don't know.

31:26.437 --> 31:31.904
They came here to make houses for the people. A big 
house to put corn and seeds for the horses. But now

31:37.451 --> 31:45.601
there are no houses? No, not now. What happened? 
Well, they removed them. Why? Well, now... The

31:56.153 --> 31:56.974
uncle died. There wasn't much work left. People 
started moving from one place to another. And then

32:08.944 --> 32:14.048
they took all the land to plant his son-in-law. And 
then the son-in-law left. And the land... The

32:19.213 --> 32:20.574
uncle and auntie died. The two old men. They died.

32:27.187 --> 32:31.175
Then the brothers were distributed from all over 
the land. From all over the land, yes. From all over

32:33.680 --> 32:35.864
the land. Each son got a little piece. Yes. How many 
sons were in this uncle's family? The uncles

32:43.159 --> 32:44.301
are... Let me see if I remember.

32:55.908 --> 32:58.351
I think there are three men.

33:03.417 --> 33:03.577
Yes. And three women. And three women too. I think 
so. Quite a lot. And there are three women. And for

33:10.886 --> 33:20.337
this reason, after the uncle died, each one of the 
children had a smaller part. A part. I think it's

33:21.058 --> 33:22.420
almost the same. Yes. It's the custom here. Well, I 
think so. And Mexico is also the custom? I don't

33:28.035 --> 33:29.417
know. You don't know? No, no, no. I don't know. I 
don't know there. In your years here, do

33:39.830 --> 33:52.645
you think about life in Mexico and here to make 
comparisons?

33:55.763 --> 34:01.852
The life in Mexico and here?

34:01.872 --> 34:01.952
Yes. Well, for me...

34:01.992 --> 34:11.165
For someone who has family, life is much better 
here. To spend life with family.

34:19.397 --> 34:19.637
Why? Well, I'm going to tell you why.

34:24.957 --> 34:26.139
Because here there is more work. And

34:26.259 --> 34:42.921
you can find... ...merchandise or food, whatever 
it is... ...a little cheaper than in Mexico.

34:42.981 --> 34:43.281
Yes. Although right now everything is a little 
expensive here. Yes, right now it's bad.

34:48.628 --> 34:49.790
Everything is expensive now. Right now it's 
expensive too. Yes. Well... The war in Mexico, the

34:54.117 --> 34:56.220
revolution. Do you know any stories about this?

35:04.492 --> 35:05.994
About the revolution in Mexico? Yes, in Mexico. 
About

35:07.556 --> 35:10.901
what? About the men who were in the revolution or 
what?

35:18.272 --> 35:18.632
Well, yes. No, well, I don't know. I heard about it. 
There comes Pancho Villa, Obregon, I

35:23.581 --> 35:34.275
don't remember. And

35:34.295 --> 35:47.391
this is a thing from your experience, but it's a 
very old thing. Yes, many years ago. Well, some

35:50.024 --> 36:03.783
people say that the revolution was a good thing for 
Mexico, and others say that it was a bad

35:50.024 --> 36:03.783
thing. What do you think about this? Well, because 
I've heard of talks, now that I'm older, that there

36:09.490 --> 36:18.883
were some who were in the revolution, fighting

36:20.129 --> 36:30.959
for the good of Mexico, for all the people. They 
weren't fighting like others, like the others,

36:32.720 --> 36:47.554
because it was the government that was fighting 
and others who stood up against the government to

36:32.720 --> 36:47.554
fight. And there were some who talk now that they 
were fighting so that the

36:49.745 --> 37:03.101
poor people had something to eat. They stood up 
against it.

37:09.830 --> 37:13.474
Because of how poor there are many people. Well, in 
Mexico, before the revolution, there were many

37:13.690 --> 37:18.808
schools. For example, do you study in Mexico? Very 
little. Very little. Yes, because my mom came here

37:25.537 --> 37:31.623
and we have to work to maintain the trip. Yes. I like 
how she maintained us when we were little. Yes. How

37:38.471 --> 37:40.853
many years did you study? What? A little, but a 
little is a year or two years in school? About two

37:46.659 --> 37:47.841
years, three. Three? Yes. Did you read in Spanish? 
A little. Yes, and write too. A little bit too. And

37:55.742 --> 38:00.669
in English?

38:00.749 --> 38:07.077
I'm going to tell you the truth. I haven't learned 
English here with these people. They

38:12.144 --> 38:16.370
speak Spanish. They speak Spanish to me all the 
time. Yes. That's why I don't... I didn't learn to

38:22.270 --> 38:26.854
speak well with them. I understand what they say 
and all that. Yes. And it wasn't necessary to learn

38:29.577 --> 38:35.022
English. Well, yes, but it's very hard for me to 
speak English. Yes. A lady. Because if I say

38:46.193 --> 38:50.978
something that is not right, there it is. It's very 
different to talk to a lady than to talk to a

38:53.033 --> 38:57.139
gentleman. Yes.

39:01.545 --> 39:04.308
Is that true? Why? Well, because you can say 
something bad when you're talking to a lady who

39:05.590 --> 39:12.900
doesn't know English perfectly.

39:15.403 --> 39:18.528
But you speak a little bit of English. Well, a 
little bit of one thing, a little bit of another.

39:23.324 --> 39:23.804
Yes. Well, this old man doesn't speak English, he 
speaks Spanish. But I understand everything he

39:30.031 --> 39:34.295
tells me. He brings me things from there, he tells 
me in English, and I take it with me. This old man who

39:40.281 --> 39:45.486
works here with you, he doesn't speak Spanish? He 
speaks Spanish, but as I tell him. There are times

39:51.995 --> 40:03.207
that he says something to me in Spanish

39:51.995 --> 40:03.207
that is not true. But he is talking to me. And that's 
what I say. If I start speaking English with you, I

40:08.873 --> 40:13.358
can say something bad to you. And you don't think 
so. That's why it's very hard to talk to a woman.

40:25.603 --> 40:31.516
With a good man, it's much more different. Yes, 
it's easier with men. Yes, because if you say

40:33.801 --> 40:38.151
something bad, they don't pay much attention. 
Well, yes, maybe it's easier for men to talk to men

40:39.380 --> 40:48.131
and women. It's easier in many ways.

40:55.560 --> 40:56.381
Yes, ma'am. Well, your children speak English. 
Yes, they do. Antonio is the one who speaks the most

41:06.160 --> 41:09.766
correct English. Because he studied it a lot. And 
your daughters went to school, right? Yes, they

41:16.095 --> 41:21.063
went to school, but they don't speak the correct 
English like Antonio. You look at Antonio

41:22.024 --> 41:31.459
speaking English, and you say, well, he's an 
American who speaks English. Because he finished

41:33.970 --> 41:41.883
the whole school when he came from the service, 
from the army. Yes. He went to the school here in Del

41:42.324 --> 41:47.833
Mar to finish the school. Ah,

41:47.853 --> 41:51.219
yes. He went to the school to learn how to put 
stickers on the cars. Yes. He finished that

41:58.591 --> 41:59.573
school.

42:02.995 --> 42:11.485
And then he went to school to study mechanics at the 
distro. What do you call big engines? Diesel?

42:16.692 --> 42:17.913
Diesel, yes. He went to school for mechanics. Yes.

42:27.545 --> 42:31.450
And your children never visited Mexico either? 
The older girl is the one who goes to Mexico

42:32.628 --> 42:35.992
instead. No, thank God. How long have you been 
doing this? I used to smoke... I used to smoke...

42:43.202 --> 42:51.213
Cigarettes

42:43.202 --> 42:51.213
like... Like 30 years. Yes. And now I have like... 
Like 5 years left. Yes, I smoke in the house, one or

42:59.375 --> 43:02.419
two. But at work I don't smoke anything. It doesn't 
tempt me to see other people who are smoking to make

43:06.964 --> 43:14.113
me want to smoke a cigarette. No. At home, yes. At 
night, when I just finished dinner, I turn on the

43:18.298 --> 43:25.207
TV, I grab a cigarette. I'm watching TV all the 
time. Sentado.

43:33.814 --> 43:38.376
Y usted vive cerca de aquí?
