WEBVTT

00:01.516 --> 00:09.492
as the prophets, and they didn't want

00:01.516 --> 00:09.492
anything preventable. And on the one hand, they 
were pressuring him to publish very esoteric

00:11.354 --> 00:30.579
plans for the Eastern European League, and I 
remember some of those people, Eastern Europe

00:11.354 --> 00:30.579
specialists, wanting their things published, 
and they were the character that they were lucky if

00:11.354 --> 00:30.579
they sold it. So on the one hand, he was impressed to 
publish things of that ilk, and on the other being

00:38.506 --> 00:42.692
sharply criticized for not breaking any revenue. 
And it was just an

00:42.712 --> 00:51.946
implausible situation. Now, as far as you had, had 
Frank ever given any information to you that, that

00:51.966 --> 00:57.194
he received from you? No. No, this was a bolt out of 
the blue. The unfortunate impression is they

01:01.333 --> 01:12.310
always believed over UT Press, and of course were 
very angry, resentful. They believed that it had

01:12.751 --> 01:22.266
been submitted at UT Press and Frank had just 
popped it and taken it that way to end it with him,

01:12.751 --> 01:22.266
and that's not true. I've told you the 
circumstances, but I had some of them

01:22.246 --> 01:30.517
subsequently make remarks to me about that. Yeah, 
they felt it had been stolen from them. Well, I know

01:34.682 --> 01:48.760
very well, and I think Frank Fowler knew well too, 
although he had a very glowing readership for it

01:34.682 --> 01:48.760
from Newcomb here, who he sent it to. and he was

01:49.178 --> 02:00.051
enthused about it, that the Action Faculty 
Committee was part of it. That's right. That's

02:00.411 --> 02:01.132
right. Yeah, I really think the Texas press kind of 
shot themselves in the foot. Oh, they did? That's

02:08.781 --> 02:09.662
our view. And that was greatly, you know, 
facilitated things that hit in. I mean, if we were

02:12.125 --> 02:14.868
able to pick up a list, that would have been a Texas 
ship. Yep. We see it as more of a Texas default. and

02:18.068 --> 02:33.343
now the funny thing is that they have they are 
scrambling that's good that's this woman from

02:18.068 --> 02:33.343
princeton has come in yeah But

02:33.982 --> 02:53.388
there was very great apprehension

02:33.982 --> 02:53.388
that she might take them back down that path. They 
had been coming back somewhat in regional

02:53.408 --> 02:57.053
history. they were afraid

02:57.792 --> 03:20.114
that this

02:57.792 --> 03:20.114
crazy woman would take them back down the trail and 
would already have destroyed the press. And she's

03:20.134 --> 03:20.715
not doing anything. So that's what we're doing. 
I'm glad, because there's enough going on to keep

03:21.296 --> 03:23.978
more people pressing. Let me pause it. So we should 
probably take this way off the track. But anyway,

03:26.210 --> 03:35.933
there were problems here, and I think the decision 
to go was a sudden decision to go there. Well, he

03:36.352 --> 03:44.066
recognized an impossible situation when he saw 
it, which I think is what Robert Gerdahl has

03:36.352 --> 03:44.066
recently done. You know, by Gerdahl, it's a 
different set of problems. But, you know, there's

03:50.498 --> 03:55.347
no use banging your head. And one of the very 
impressive things about that was about how much he

03:59.875 --> 04:04.340
cared. He cared about

04:04.360 --> 04:09.785
authors. And he took such very good care of them. 
And he came over to see me. I had such trust in Frank.

04:19.335 --> 04:23.740
I didn't even have a lawyer

04:19.335 --> 04:23.740
look at him. I

04:24.698 --> 04:42.297
have profited ever since I survived. He says, no, 
you'll notice an unusual name. He says, it's a

04:43.198 --> 04:43.839
brief statement. And so I took special good care of 
my name, saving it for myself. But at any rate, he

04:45.180 --> 04:46.882
said, you will notice that the copywriter's name 
is in your name. And he says, most publishers get it

04:46.902 --> 04:47.903
in their name. And he said, I think that is 
unintentional and that we will alter it. should

04:49.775 --> 04:54.962
ever be put up with that. Oh, yes. I subsequently 
have published with

04:55.723 --> 05:01.410
OU Press. I had something coming

05:01.430 --> 05:13.366
up that was much more suitable for them than for the 
direction that AM Press was thinking. And the

05:13.386 --> 05:17.571
first contract I got, the copyright would be in 
their name, and I wrote back and asked to have it

05:13.386 --> 05:17.571
changed. And

05:18.125 --> 05:32.597
John Drake was very surprised. He says this is 
unusual, but I don't think it's good. And it's

05:33.700 --> 05:34.822
unusual to have an open view of the difference. It 
has made a lot of difference to me, because I think

05:34.842 --> 05:36.927
that storms would be dead if I hadn't been there. 
Yeah, because the direction of the press has

05:39.775 --> 05:50.386
changed,

05:39.775 --> 05:50.386
you know, three times. And nothing is correct. And

05:51.908 --> 06:02.519
you can't count

05:51.908 --> 06:02.519
on successors to deliver on policies that were 
made in good faith. And so, anyhow, I own this. And I

06:03.099 --> 06:03.960
owe that to Christ. And then the people that he 
coaxed along and took care of. Buck, you

06:14.157 --> 06:17.020
mentioned. Oh, yeah. And I can remember staying at 
their house, and Buck was a long-time guest over at

06:17.241 --> 06:25.149
that wonderful old house. It kind of goes very 
similar. That was one of my favorite things about

06:25.950 --> 06:28.513
that whole experience with Buck. And then he, 
Frank, the whole time he was here, and that was 25

06:28.713 --> 06:48.240
years ago, nursed along Edgar Kincaid to get that 
massive bird book out. And Edgar

06:49.148 --> 07:11.047
was

06:49.148 --> 07:11.047
as quirky as any human

06:49.148 --> 07:11.047
being on the face of the earth. And, uh, any other 
fellows you've heard of him? Sure. And Frank

07:12.148 --> 07:14.190
nurtured him along, and it was the last thing 
published that you could ask a book about him. And

07:14.210 --> 07:15.551
it was one of the first projects he's done for a 
hundred years. So he had enormous patience and

07:15.571 --> 07:16.452
persistence. And there was a good range of his 
contents. Yeah.

07:39.214 --> 07:39.775
The Aggies really turned up. I mean, Frank Marvel 
was there, too. But, you know, these people think

07:40.896 --> 07:42.018
this isn't their book. Yes. And I didn't know. I'm 
not sure the faculty didn't have that kind of

07:42.519 --> 07:44.501
interest. But one of the students did. This wasn't 
their book. Right. Yes, he was, he taught it. And,

07:46.905 --> 07:47.826
of course, he could fit right in to that. That Aggie 
party scene. Yeah, that's right. In fact,

07:54.320 --> 08:01.148
Rosemary mentioned that. She said, you know,

08:01.168 --> 08:09.697
we had such a tiny kitchen and we had to put in the 
parts. Yes. And she said one day, in fact, before

08:09.818 --> 08:11.700
the fire burned the thing up, they put in a new 
kitchen. Uh-huh. And, you know, I have a little

08:11.880 --> 08:12.801
memory of that. And

08:15.312 --> 08:41.235
part of that was his you know his entrepreneurial 
sense but part of it was that was genuine that was

08:42.194 --> 09:10.767
yeah it was that was the way frank was that's right 
and my understanding is of course the last stream

08:42.194 --> 09:10.767
was always out of their house and that they they 
entertained a great deal in fact i think on the food

08:42.194 --> 09:10.767
kind of sustained that too

08:42.194 --> 09:10.767
you know Let me ask you a very broad question about 
presses in Texas. Where does A&M fit? Where does

09:24.719 --> 09:25.761
Texas fit? Have you ever thought to think about a 
New York press concept? Where are they? I don't

09:32.150 --> 09:32.510
know. I've pondered that myself. You know, 
everything is always in such blocks. that I really

09:39.451 --> 09:41.673
don't know. I don't think that it's very 
predictable. I don't know whether the era

09:45.937 --> 09:57.649
of being a strong publisher is over. The era in 
which my perceptions were shaped was the era of

09:58.049 --> 10:07.078
Wardlaw and Taxes not being able to do anything. I 
wouldn't have published the Boston Bill because I

10:08.797 --> 10:14.070
knew too much about how many communities we 
developed. Is that right? And I just, you know, the

10:16.035 --> 10:21.388
people who knew I was trying to get that published 
were just amazed that I wouldn't. I wouldn't

10:21.790 --> 10:31.642
submit it to a book club. I didn't trust Savoy. I 
knew Savoy. Savoy did some wonderful things. He

10:37.409 --> 10:38.550
also did some horrible things to authors. Some of 
them have been friends of mine. In fact, one of them

10:41.294 --> 10:43.196
was a professor from the department I was working 
in. He wrote a book in the press there. And, of

10:44.723 --> 11:04.967
course, I had had that unasked-for

10:44.723 --> 11:04.967
letter

10:44.723 --> 11:04.967
from Savoy telling me what to do with that to make it 
into a book, and the book came out. But anyhow, I'm

11:04.987 --> 11:05.868
losing my dreadful eye here. So that's why I would 
not have published with him then, but I finally did

11:05.888 --> 11:07.710
publish with him. uh

11:07.943 --> 11:23.877
i i had to be assured that the gray index was on the 
document last year uh was not still called because

11:07.943 --> 11:23.877
that would have been bad news on the contrary I

11:24.953 --> 11:35.725
don't think anyone

11:24.953 --> 11:35.725
knows where those came from. And I was 
comfortable, when, when Lord Lyman refused to

11:35.745 --> 11:45.276
honor the promise that Franklin was going to knock 
on the paperback, and I insisted that the rise be

11:35.745 --> 11:45.276
so, I suggested that they be sold to Bransford. 
Because, yeah, that list made sense, and because

11:45.416 --> 11:51.703
they, Gilbert, had been raised by Frank in the 
publishing business. And so, and of course, Frank

11:57.065 --> 12:04.614
was just crushed when they refused to open the 
paper as a successor to it. Yeah, I know. Yeah, I

12:05.114 --> 12:09.119
have that part of the point. And he was frightfully 
upset that they didn't do that. But of course, they

12:13.303 --> 12:14.805
wanted to wipe out all traces of Ward Lawism. And it 
was much healthier for Dave to go up there and so I

12:19.014 --> 12:31.292
got that sold to Nebraska and it fared very well as 
long as Dave was there. But Dave went. He got an

12:31.633 --> 12:35.038
offer he couldn't refuse to sell. And authors who 
had

12:36.267 --> 12:43.383
been very happy with the work today were 
subsequently not as happy. But others,

12:43.403 --> 12:48.034
you know, have been very happy. So, I don't know. I 
think it's all in such turmoil. And they all work

12:53.146 --> 12:55.491
under such difficulties. Yes, they do. That's 
right.

13:03.569 --> 13:15.225
But in a way,

13:03.569 --> 13:15.225
it always is. Is Frank back down there? Yeah. 
retired oh that's right well that was his last job

13:20.547 --> 13:33.932
i've forgotten you know he he did some moving 
around and you're talking about you know what's

13:20.547 --> 13:33.932
going to happen to books you know That's

13:34.300 --> 13:58.870
about as

13:34.300 --> 13:58.870
far as we've been. At the Texas A&M School of Law 
meeting last month, I had a chance to sit next to

13:58.890 --> 14:01.233
David Gracie at the fellows meeting. And Gracie, 
who is a professor at my mother's program, and has,

14:01.253 --> 14:04.257
until recently, been a social worker, was quite 
upset about a conversation that he had And the

14:04.743 --> 14:08.949
Thursday night reception was Senator Sibley. And 
you would think that Marilyn Sibley's son would

14:08.969 --> 14:14.797
have been raised in the past, but I'm just messing 
with you. And Senator Sibley, whom I admire, I

14:14.817 --> 14:20.585
think he's one of the most positive. I don't know 
about her, no. Well, a lot of the best things that

14:22.408 --> 14:29.738
get done over in the legislature have been granted 
David Sibley. And I don't often get excited about

14:29.718 --> 14:38.013
Republicans, but I would marry him because I like 
his mother so much. But anyhow, as I said, David

14:38.033 --> 14:43.784
Sidney was talking about they weren't going to 
need to buy books. And they weren't going to need to

14:45.487 --> 14:50.176
sort out books and decide what to keep and what not 
to. Just put it all on the table. And we're not going

14:52.680 --> 14:53.582
to have to buy it. a book for every campus of the 
university. We'll all just buy one book for all

14:55.904 --> 15:02.030
these campuses and put it on the wall. Well, David 
has just... I haven't heard that one. Well, I hope

15:10.958 --> 15:14.581
that somebody can calm him down. If he finds out the 
expense of doing that, and then what it will cost

15:14.601 --> 15:23.029
everybody to download what they need, I

15:23.262 --> 15:53.067
don't know whether it

15:23.262 --> 15:53.067
would be useful to you
