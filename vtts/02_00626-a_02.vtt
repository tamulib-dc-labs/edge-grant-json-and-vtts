WEBVTT

00:00.031 --> 00:16.313
Now

00:00.031 --> 00:16.313
by 1937, do you pretty well have your career staked 
out as it was going to exist until 1940? Were you

00:17.235 --> 00:20.940
moving into new fields or pretty well remaining on 
the California coast? Well, we were gradually

00:22.983 --> 00:27.709
sort of expanding our our area of interest, we'd 
started working really off the coast of Southern

00:28.212 --> 00:34.489
California. And in 1940, we did make a cruise as far 
north as roughly the Columbia River. And another

00:45.357 --> 01:05.456
venture that was in 1939 was a cruise to the Gulf of 
California, which we made in the winter of that

00:45.357 --> 01:05.456
year, which was the first time that any vessel from 
Scripps had really ventured very far away from

00:45.357 --> 01:05.456
home. And this was really sort of exploring in 
those days because so little was known. And I don't

01:15.563 --> 01:23.454
know what might have happened if the war had not 
intervened. And I think that we would have had to

01:23.635 --> 01:44.845
find some larger vessel, and that we would have, 
presumably within a few years at least, have moved

01:23.635 --> 01:44.845
out to operations on sort of an ocean-wide scale. 
But

01:45.584 --> 02:15.237
actually,

01:45.584 --> 02:15.237
I left Scripps in July of 1941, having spent a month 
prior to that at Woods Hole to learn something

01:45.584 --> 02:15.237
about the interpretation of bathy thermograph 
observations in terms of underwater sound

02:15.942 --> 02:21.789
problems. And on July the 1st, I moved down to the 
Navy laboratory on Point Loma, which not as an

02:22.029 --> 02:39.469
employee of the Navy, but under one of these war 
research programs

02:41.238 --> 02:52.891
was funded later on by the NDRC, the National 
Defense Research Committee, I think it was

02:41.238 --> 02:52.891
called. And this was a essentially federally 
funded war research program administered

02:52.911 --> 03:00.901
through the University of California. And I 
stated in this program at Point Loma until early in

03:05.032 --> 03:09.098
1946.

03:13.806 --> 03:29.630
By that time, the work had been taken over by the 
Navy itself, but I still continued, as did many of

03:13.806 --> 03:29.630
the others there, to be actually as employed by the 
University of California. And during the first

03:33.719 --> 03:46.125
year or so down there, the work was primarily, that 
I was engaged in, was primarily how you might

03:33.719 --> 03:46.125
interpret various physical conditions in the 
ocean, primarily temperature and salinity and so

03:46.730 --> 04:07.314
on, in terms of the acoustic conditions in the 
ocean, what we used to call the echo-ranging

03:46.730 --> 04:07.314
problem, and this gradually gave way to some other 
environmentally related problems. But I became

04:07.414 --> 04:15.083
more and more involved in general sort of 
administration

04:15.552 --> 04:22.780
of some of the basic research going on at the 
laboratory on Point Loma. And toward the end, I

04:23.681 --> 04:39.578
actually was an assistant director in charge of 
the research, which involved primarily a set of

04:23.681 --> 04:39.578
acoustics of various kinds, but a good many other 
types of activities. I have several questions on

04:40.058 --> 04:41.560
that. Now, you go to Woods Hole, though, to work 
with the BT for anti-submarine warfare, don't

04:41.793 --> 04:46.198
you? I did go back and work with Robert Montgomery 
for about a month, because at that time, as I

04:47.900 --> 05:10.247
indicated earlier, we really didn't know what the 
bathy thermograph was measuring and so on, and

04:47.900 --> 05:10.247
also how you might be able to use this kind of 
information in these underwater sound problems.

05:10.430 --> 05:15.096
And we were all very naive as to what we were doing. 
But I contributed my small part here to the whole

05:15.256 --> 05:27.191
program in that I was the one who suggested they 
make photographic copies. And Montgomery and I

05:27.391 --> 05:32.337
worked out the first sort of system coding these 
things and keeping the appropriate records and so

05:32.941 --> 05:42.271
on, which has persisted for a good many years after 
that. Right. You're looking for ways of measuring

05:44.454 --> 05:49.019
thermal claims. In effect, yes. There had been 
some work done by Columbus Island at Woods Hole by

05:56.060 --> 06:23.822
Morris Ewing and some of the other people that were 
associated with them in the preceding few years,

05:56.060 --> 06:23.822
which showed the probable relationship of 
temperature and humidity conditions on

05:56.060 --> 06:23.822
Underwater Sound. Morris Ewing's contribution, 
I think, was particularly to show that you could

06:24.106 --> 06:40.525
use some of the refraction computations that he 
was familiar with from his work in geophysics

06:24.106 --> 06:40.525
would be applied to these conditions in the ocean. 
And of course, it was not directly temperature and

06:40.606 --> 06:49.456
salinity that was involved here, but rather the 
distribution of sound velocity. And so there were

06:53.806 --> 07:01.993
We had the clue as to what we should be doing, 
although a lot of the sort of techniques had not

06:53.806 --> 07:01.993
been worked out. particularly during the first 
year or so, much effort went into devising ways of

07:02.665 --> 07:31.744
calculating these so-called ray diagrams and 
seeing how you could, in a sense, simplify some of

07:02.665 --> 07:31.744
the conditions as you observed in the ocean to 
compute these sort of ray diagrams

07:02.665 --> 07:31.744
and so on.

07:32.213 --> 07:44.816
Then a lot of effort was spent in the first year or 
two of making up what were called sound ranging

07:32.213 --> 07:44.816
charts or sonar charts, which didn't depend just 
on the BT. We used every scrap of information we

07:44.876 --> 07:53.833
could to essentially try and come up with some semi 
quantitative approach of the regional

07:54.573 --> 08:05.394
differences in sound ranging conditions that 
might be predicted from known characteristics of

07:54.573 --> 08:05.394
the ocean waters. Why photography? I'm sorry? Why 
photography? What made you think of photography?

08:10.655 --> 08:32.376
Oh, I guess because my father was a photographer 
and it seemed to me that the BT slide was like a

08:10.655 --> 08:32.376
negative, why not put it in a projector and just 
make a print from this, which could then be

08:10.655 --> 08:32.376
enlarged too, because the original BT slide you 
really had to insert in a magnifier in order to read

08:33.031 --> 08:43.423
it, we more or less standardized on what was 
roughly a postcard size reproduction. All you

08:44.304 --> 08:56.659
have to do is stick them in a regular photographic 
enlarging machine and use fairly contrasty

08:44.304 --> 08:56.659
paper.

08:57.584 --> 09:00.768
When you're working, I need to know something else 
here, too, right now. Why didn't you go with Revell

09:01.128 --> 09:06.074
to the Navy and to Washington at this time? Why did 
you choose Point Loma? Well, here again, there's

09:07.936 --> 09:20.031
some kind of interesting things that, if I 
remember correctly, about 1939, there was some

09:20.433 --> 09:24.899
concern about the international situation and so 
on. Revelle had applied for and obtained a reserve

09:25.660 --> 09:35.793
commission as an ensign and I applied too. I think 
it was somewhat later than that because Yes, must

09:41.240 --> 09:43.583
have been. I have somewhere in my files a letter 
that I received from the Navy saying that they

09:43.784 --> 10:00.868
regretted they couldn't offer me a commission 
because they had no foreseeable need for

09:43.784 --> 10:00.868
oceanographers.

10:01.085 --> 10:12.960
Of course, Revelle went down to Point Loma at that 
same time, and I just, I can't really remember how

10:01.085 --> 10:12.960
long he was there, but he was there for about a year 
or two before he went back to Washington. But I had

10:14.062 --> 10:23.674
tried that route, but it didn't work. And

10:24.775 --> 10:30.923
I think that answers it, sure. And then during 
those war years, then you're involved in research

10:31.510 --> 10:36.956
at Point Loma itself. Yes, I would, as I look back on 
it now, I did a good deal of

10:37.277 --> 10:59.442
research, particularly in the first year or two, 
but really what I became more and more involved in

10:37.277 --> 10:59.442
was what I would consider a science 
administration. things moved very rapidly in

10:59.860 --> 11:20.755
those days and so there was a great deal of sort of 
planning and and a good deal of traveling involved

10:59.860 --> 11:20.755
in that that under the NDRC where there were 
several centers were work of this kind was going

11:21.359 --> 11:45.392
on, and they served as a sort of coordinating 
function, and so we met at what seemed like fairly

11:21.359 --> 11:45.392
frequent intervals for discussions of what we 
were doing, what we were finding, what we ought to

11:21.359 --> 11:45.392
do, and also in trying to prepare sort of manuals 
and documents of various kinds for the Navy. So

11:45.372 --> 11:54.232
this is part of what I sort of consider as the 
administrative side. We weren't involved, I

11:54.592 --> 12:03.432
wasn't involved too much with actual sort of 
budgeting or matters of that kind, but it didn't,

12:03.884 --> 12:27.286
What it didn't involve was us breaking out from the 
rather narrow kind of confines of individual

12:03.884 --> 12:27.286
research and getting involved with the programs 
and activities of a variety, a relatively large

12:03.884 --> 12:27.286
number of people in fields that I had absolutely no 
familiarity with at all. And this, I think, was one

12:27.306 --> 12:32.811
of the effects of the war, that those of us who were 
involved in activities of this kind really got

12:33.128 --> 12:49.753
broken away from what would have been a normal sort 
of pattern of

12:33.128 --> 12:49.753
career evolution here. and got thrust into very 
large, very complex kind of problems involving

12:49.987 --> 13:02.101
fields which were originally at least unfamiliar 
to us. That anticipates, as a matter of fact, my

13:03.863 --> 13:05.906
next question. With whom did you come into contact 
in about 1941 to 1943 that sort of moves you into

13:05.926 --> 13:11.933
administrative oceanography here all at once? 
Well, Professor Sverdrup was originally to

13:19.957 --> 13:47.736
essentially head up the the kind of oceanographic 
component at the Point Loma laboratory, but he

13:19.957 --> 13:47.736
encountered security problems because of having 
his family, not his immediate family, but

13:19.957 --> 13:47.736
relatives in Norway and so on, and it was felt that 
he was in a sensitive set of positions, so they

13:48.408 --> 14:10.078
would not give him security clearance and I 
essentially had to take over what he had might have

13:48.408 --> 14:10.078
done and he returned and he never really left it 
because this was only a part-time sort of activity

13:48.408 --> 14:10.078
down Point Loma but he returned so full-time to to 
Scripps, and he and Walter Monk, whom we had

14:10.531 --> 14:25.529
originally had down at Point Loma with us, and who 
could not get security clearance. Sverdrup and

14:27.071 --> 14:38.445
Monk took on this study of the wave problem, and I 
think it started originally under the Air Force's

14:27.071 --> 14:38.445
support. And out of that there's this whole 
amazingly rapid development of understanding of

14:38.999 --> 15:01.610
the problems of wave characteristics, wind wave 
characteristics, and methods of predicting wind

14:38.999 --> 15:01.610
wave conditions and swell and surf and so on. And 
then out of that activity came the

15:09.037 --> 15:31.257
training program which was set up at Scripps, 
which I had no direct contact at all, although I was

15:09.037 --> 15:31.257
living within a few miles of it, which brought in a 
number of young officers from the Air Force and the

15:09.037 --> 15:31.257
Navy who were trained in these wave forecasting 
techniques. And as we were saying this morning,

15:31.277 --> 15:36.242
later on, a number of these young men returned to 
Scripps and finished off their doctoral work. But

15:41.596 --> 15:59.040
that was really one of the, I think, very dramatic 
set of developments during the war, because prior

15:41.596 --> 15:59.040
to the time that Sverdrup and Munk turned their 
attention to this problem, which they had not

15:41.596 --> 15:59.040
really dealt with previously, there was 
virtually nothing known about the

15:59.425 --> 16:05.473
characteristics of ocean waves. It was a body of 
theory, but very little connection between the

16:05.574 --> 16:13.525
sort of theory and the real conditions. And there 
was only a very, very limited literature about

16:13.545 --> 16:20.194
wave conditions and wave behavior.

16:23.879 --> 16:28.926
Did you consciously make an effort at about 45 to go 
to Washington or to DC, or did that just happen?

16:29.918 --> 16:59.368
Well, here again I think Ravel enters the story 
because he had moved from the Navy laboratory at

16:29.918 --> 16:59.368
Point Loma to the Bureau of Ships and in particular 
to the, I think it was called the sonar design

16:29.918 --> 16:59.368
section or something to that name under a I can't 
remember his rank now, but Bennett, and had the

17:00.091 --> 17:27.330
imagination to see the role and importance of 
ocean information to the Navy, and yet there was no

17:00.091 --> 17:27.330
mechanism by which the Navy could essentially 
continue the oceanographic studies and so on and

17:00.091 --> 17:27.330
other. there are a number of sort of related 
threads to the story which are involved in this

17:27.850 --> 17:54.229
thing, and that is that, as I mentioned earlier, at 
Woods Hole and at Point Loma, we prepared, for

17:27.850 --> 17:54.229
example, these sonar charts and so on, they were 
actually published through the Hydrographic

17:54.361 --> 17:59.267
Office. And so that during the war, they had set up 
in the Hydrographic Office an oceanographic

17:59.647 --> 18:12.302
unit, I believe it was called at that time. And this 
was under the direction of Mary Sears, who was

18:13.002 --> 18:19.570
being commissioned as a wave. And they served 
during the war. as essentially a publications

18:24.263 --> 18:46.592
outlet for some of the material being prepared 
under these war research laboratory programs,

18:24.263 --> 18:46.592
and they did some compilation of various kinds of 
information, but this was a temporary sort of

18:24.263 --> 18:46.592
situation. And one of the things that Revell and 
others were able to accomplish was to have the Navy

18:46.927 --> 19:09.293
Department set up on a continuing basis an 
oceanographic section in what was then the

18:46.927 --> 19:09.293
Hydrographic Office. And I was essentially 
offered the position, and it looked extremely

19:13.690 --> 19:32.688
interesting and important to me at that time to go 
back and start what was known when I arrived as the

19:13.690 --> 19:32.688
Division of Oceanography in the Hydrographic 
Office. Of course, the whole thing later became

19:32.708 --> 19:42.837
the Oceanographic Office, but it was a division.

19:43.070 --> 20:06.040
Shortly after I arrived, in April of 1946, the

19:43.070 --> 20:06.040
oceanographic unit that had been in existence was 
being phased out, and the new division reached a

19:43.070 --> 20:06.040
low ebb of one girl who helped me and myself. I left 
about five years later with over 200 people in the

20:10.707 --> 20:25.227
division and operating two sort of what were at 
that time very large oceanographic vessels for

20:10.707 --> 20:25.227
the Hydrographic Office. So this was, yes, a 
challenging sort of thing. I felt that there were

20:31.428 --> 20:44.600
urgent needs to keep a sort of a national program 
going rather than letting things die, as they

20:31.428 --> 20:44.600
might have at the end of the war. And

20:45.380 --> 20:54.589
I think this was Turned out to be quite correct. 
What sort of people did you look for when you went to

20:57.689 --> 21:00.853
establish this office? Did you already have some 
people in mind whom you wished to bring to

21:00.873 --> 21:04.118
Washington? Well, only a few people that I'd known 
for one reason or another and seemed desirable and

21:04.719 --> 21:24.947
seemed appropriate for the job.

21:25.720 --> 21:40.422
people that really were brought in as to be my 
principal assistants were Clifford Barnes, who

21:25.720 --> 21:40.422
you'll probably talk to next week, But he only 
spent a relatively short time with us and then

21:40.925 --> 21:45.930
returned to the University of Washington. John 
Lyman, who you may have encountered, who had been

21:47.331 --> 21:58.562
in the Navy all during the war as a reserve officer 
and had been at Scripps before that. Thomas

22:00.725 --> 22:08.232
Austin, who's now head of the National Data 
Center, and young man who'd been at the WAVE

22:08.971 --> 22:18.946
program at Scripps during the war, Charles Bates, 
who's now chief scientist for the Coast Guard. So

22:18.966 --> 22:33.308
those were the, in a sense, senior people who came 
in early in the game, but what was, it's,

22:36.157 --> 22:47.071
I think interesting looking back that far, which 
is just over 30 years ago, that at that time there

22:36.157 --> 22:47.071
was no classification in the civil service for 
anybody called an oceanographer. So one of my

22:47.091 --> 22:58.485
first sort of jobs back there was to set up the job 
descriptions for oceanographers, get them

22:47.091 --> 22:58.485
approved by the the Civil Service Commission and 
then began to try and recruit some people. And I

23:04.625 --> 23:08.650
very soon found that there weren't very many 
people to be recruited. And as any administrator,

23:09.811 --> 23:25.367
I abhor as a job vacancy why we were in the position 
of having to hire people with degrees in physics or

23:09.811 --> 23:25.367
chemistry or geology and so on. with essentially 
no experience whatsoever in oceanographic

23:25.988 --> 23:31.935
problems. And I soon realized, as I'd learned 
during the war, that there was a real need for some

23:31.955 --> 23:43.267
kind of program to train people or educate people 
in the field. And so, as I sometimes remark, I

23:44.348 --> 23:55.000
decided to get out of the hiring business and get 
into the manufacturing business. opportunity to

23:55.621 --> 24:00.026
come to the University of Washington looked 
attractive to me. Not only was it sort of

24:00.086 --> 24:07.013
intellectually attractive, but I thought there 
was a very real sort of need here. Now, there was

24:07.113 --> 24:18.726
some graduate programs available in the early 
years following the war, but One of the things that

24:19.550 --> 24:32.774
really stimulated me into coming to the 
University of Washington was the opportunity to

24:19.550 --> 24:32.774
set up an undergraduate program in oceanography, 
which had never been attempted before. I want to

24:32.914 --> 24:37.542
return to your trip to Washington, because that's 
extremely important to us. I have several

24:37.741 --> 24:43.248
questions, though, right here concerning your 
activities in DC itself rather than Washington

24:37.741 --> 24:43.248
state. Was there much conflict between these 
civilian oceanographers and Navy personnel when

24:44.450 --> 24:49.817
you began to establish this office? Well, I 
wouldn't say there was any conflict. We were

24:54.102 --> 25:01.332
looked on as a set of screwballs by the 
establishment within the Hydrographic Office.

25:01.372 --> 25:02.213
They didn't know quite thought we were or who we 
were or anything else. And so we were allowed

25:06.399 --> 25:21.637
really a considerable amount of sort of freedom 
simply because they had no prior experience in

25:06.399 --> 25:21.637
this area. And this

25:28.400 --> 25:52.703
period, and I can't identify it specifically by 
year, but the military budgets were being cut back

25:28.400 --> 25:52.703
very severely in the late 40s, and along with them 
the Hydrographic Office was being cut back by

25:28.400 --> 25:52.703
major amounts,

25:28.400 --> 25:52.703
and yet the oceanographic program continued to 
grow, and this of course was looked on with some

25:53.088 --> 26:13.235
sort of favor and encouragement here, but I think 
they realized that there was something to be done

25:53.088 --> 26:13.235
here. Now, the people who are sort of particularly 
important and encouraging and supporting the

26:20.915 --> 26:40.067
growth of the Oceanographic Program were not so 
much within the office itself, but in the Office of

26:20.915 --> 26:40.067
the Chief of Naval Operations, people concerned 
with anti-submarine warfare and pro-submarine

26:20.915 --> 26:40.067
warfare and so on, the operating forces. And it was 
largely through their interest that we got the

26:45.333 --> 26:50.941
support and opportunities we did. What about ONR? 
Well, ONR, I have to stop and think here again. That

26:57.871 --> 27:00.855
got started when, about 46? 46. It's not really 
called ONR then, but Revell begins to think about

27:01.636 --> 27:06.703
ONR in 46. Yes, it was the Office of, what was it 
called, something rather off, or Something and

27:13.126 --> 27:14.949
Invention. Yeah, right. It's a strange title. 
Yes, and it must have got established about that

27:16.732 --> 27:33.480
time, and Revelle then moved from the

27:16.732 --> 27:33.480
Bureau of Ships to the newly established And, of 
course, the establishment of ONR was, in a sense, a

27:34.118 --> 28:01.425
response to the phasing out of these wartime

27:34.118 --> 28:01.425
research activities under NDRC and the parent 
organization, which was OSRD, Office of

27:34.118 --> 28:01.425
Scientific Research and Development, I guess it 
was. So the Navy was, in a sense, trying to find some

28:01.760 --> 28:08.489
mechanism to keep some of their programs going. We 
worked very sort of closely together, although I

28:10.793 --> 28:25.253
cannot remember that there were ever any sort of 
transfer of funds or anything as one might

28:10.793 --> 28:25.253
anticipate in more recent times. But I actually 
spent almost a year of it, and it must have been

28:25.688 --> 28:44.170
about 1949-50, I spent the better part of a year 
actually in ONR on loan, in a sense, from the

28:45.162 --> 28:55.236
Hydrographic Office to work on planning and so 
forth as related to anti-submarine problems. And

28:55.817 --> 29:08.976
so there was a good sort of, I think, there was no 
conflict there as I ran into some sort of

29:10.120 --> 29:32.243
difficulties that you'd almost anticipate 
anywhere, but I had really very good rapport, I

29:10.120 --> 29:32.243
think, with the people in the Hydrographic 
Office, and CNO, and ONR, and Bureau of Ships, and

29:10.120 --> 29:32.243
so on. So, no, I don't feel there was any 
antagonism, certainly there was a difference in

29:40.073 --> 29:49.864
perspectives on a lot of the problems. I went back 
to Washington with the idea that we ought to be

29:51.366 --> 30:08.646
doing a lot of work on the Arctic, and this had 
seemed to me a good sort of subject in which we knew

29:51.366 --> 30:08.646
very little and that we ought to be doing some work 
up there and And here's where we got into

30:09.352 --> 30:39.021
lack of appreciation on the part of the 
particularly CNO who informed me and my boss, the

30:09.352 --> 30:39.021
hydrographer, in no uncertain terms that the Navy 
had no plans to operate in the Arctic and therefore

30:09.352 --> 30:39.021
had no reason to want to spend any money trying to 
find out about it. So one of the things I was able to

30:42.755 --> 30:59.170
do, in part with assistance from ONR and some 
others, was to in effect bootleg some, get some

30:42.755 --> 30:59.170
work started in the Arctic.
