their lunch along down there. They wouldn't come

02:02.616 --> 02:07.483
out until evening, you know, about four or five. I 
see. You lived at the mine site? Yeah, I lived out

02:11.108 --> 02:12.510
there. I was born out there. Could you describe the 
house in which you lived? The what? The house where

02:17.919 --> 02:20.682
you lived out there at the mines? What did it look 
like? Oh, it was an old house, kind of like this

Seven with the bag. Seven with the bag, at least she 
said. Out there at the mine. At the mine, yeah. And

03:08.182 --> 03:10.806
then they had two porches on it, you know, 
honestly. Old-time, you know how they used to have

03:11.157 --> 03:12.959
houses. It's kind of like these steps in the 
old-time house, too. You got two by sixes there.

03:18.626 --> 03:19.527
That's the old number. 42NC, that's later on, they 
made a letter. Right. See that? That's the old

03:24.153 --> 03:25.835

letter. Right. You know, played it. Uh-huh. Well,

03:32.383 --> 03:37.089
with this house out there, what years were you 
living out at Global Mine? Since I was born, I was

03:38.350 --> 03:40.793
born in 1900. 1900. We moved out here in 1919. How 
many years? So it's 19 years you lived at the mine

03:46.638 --> 03:50.525
site itself. I said we moved out here in 1919. I was 
born out here in 1900, December 21st. Did your

03:58.699 --> 04:01.583
father work in the mine all his life? No, he didn't.

04:07.975 --> 04:19.851
And then Grandpa, he opened up that lignite mine 
out there, so Daddy went to work for him. Grandpa?

04:21.694 --> 04:22.815
Grandpa Vogel, yeah. Grandpa Vogel. Yeah, he 
opened that lignite mine out here with coffee.

04:29.086 --> 04:30.508
clubhouse, I don't know if he went. He's about two 
miles from here. That's the first link that I might

04:33.351 --> 04:38.817
fix, they said, you know, on this side of the road, 
north side of the road. Right. Yeah, it's about two

04:40.139 --> 04:41.720
miles out here. Yeah, so daddy went to work for him, 
you know. Right. Went to work for him, him and

04:48.228 --> 04:56.597

05:23.187 --> 05:25.090
Did you go to school out at the mines? School, 
school. Yeah, we were taught at which school?

05:30.157 --> 05:33.162
Excuse me, there at the Mines, or did you come in 
Rockdale? No, Talbert Ridge School. That is over

05:34.384 --> 05:35.005
here. I did the country. About two months you had to 
work. What was the name of that school? Talbert

05:39.853 --> 05:40.655

Yeah, Talbert Ridge. Talbert Ridge. Did you go to

05:48.208 --> 05:54.418
school three, four months out of the year, or how 
long did you go to school? I was a full term.

06:00.363 --> 06:12.678
For the term, let me see, I guess from September, 
September till, I guess I could have got to school

06:00.363 --> 06:12.678
now almost about that long, I believe. Oh, you did? 
Did you like going to school out there? Yeah. Did

06:17.103 --> 06:17.383
you? Willie told me yesterday that he played hooky 
somewhere. Yeah, he never got there. He wouldn't

06:23.811 --> 06:25.213
go anywhere. He stayed in the woods, you know. But 
you liked to go to school? Yeah, I went to school. I

06:31.068 --> 06:37.575
went to seventh grade, I think, when I taught out

06:31.068 --> 06:37.575
in the country. Well, they had me play hooky, you 
know, and Daddy would take the bell out in the

06:37.615 --> 06:46.744
morning and finish school with us, you know, and 
lay it out in the woods till it even didn't come back

06:37.615 --> 06:46.744
home, you know. Well, he said he was sorry now he did 
that, you know, because he can't do it and write

06:48.285 --> 06:52.690
much. Yeah. I'm sure he learned a lot out there in 
the woods. I don't know, maybe. Well, did you get

07:00.404 --> 07:04.310
along with the Mexican families out there? Yeah, 
we done all right.

07:11.961 --> 07:18.111
Well, you lived in a big house then, comparatively 
speaking, to their houses. Can you remember how

07:18.131 --> 07:19.653
their houses lived? The other house, they had one 
room, one kitchen. One room, one kitchen? Yeah,

07:24.841 --> 07:27.525
just for the, you know, for the... Grandma owned 
them houses, you know, and she rented out to the

07:28.636 --> 07:33.303
Mexicans, you know. I see. Mine belonged to 
Grandpa. Grandma and them had them. I made about 30

07:41.634 --> 07:44.538
houses, I believe. The Mexicans, they paid rent 
every two weeks, you know. They weren't there but

07:48.284 --> 07:49.425
two weeks? They paid rent every two weeks. I see. 
They paid the Mexicans every two weeks. I see. Did

07:59.045 --> 08:04.655
you go into Rockdale very often or did you stay out 
of the mine camp most of the time? I stayed out there

08:04.675 --> 08:09.144
most of the time.

08:09.164 --> 08:13.091
So in 1919, what happened? Did you leave the mines 
then? No. And you came here? Yes. And you became a

08:16.978 --> 08:18.020
farmer? Yes, I was a farmer. Had you saved up some 
money to buy some land? No. Were you a

08:24.053 --> 08:26.777
sharecropper, or did you come with your father? I 
came with his dad, yeah. I see. So he was able to save

08:29.520 --> 08:34.507
up some money from working at the mines to buy his 
own land? Yeah, he got it all. We owed some of it. We

08:37.731 --> 08:42.978
got to pay it all, you know.

08:43.880 --> 08:46.964
Can you remember anything about the commissary 
out there at the mine? Yeah, kind of something,

08:48.446 --> 08:50.028
yeah. Do you remember what it looked like? It was 
just one room building, you know, just one room.

08:57.912 --> 09:04.279
Just made box lumber, you know, just plain 
building, you know. What kind of goods were sold at

09:04.299 --> 09:08.023
the commissary? Ah, they sold more just grocery 
stuff, I believe. No clothes or anything? No, I

09:13.729 --> 09:20.436
don't blame

09:13.729 --> 09:20.436
you. You were down there only six months, but you 
must remember some of the hazards of mining. Were

09:26.920 --> 09:30.204
there any dangers down there in the mines? Not too 
much. Down there, you know, some dirt would fall

09:31.185 --> 09:34.029
down. Tunnels, you know, tunnels about that wide, 
you know. So down there, some would cave down, you

09:37.613 --> 09:45.302
know, and they'd put props under there, you know, 
to keep from, you know, falling on the workers,

09:37.613 --> 09:45.302
yeah. How was the air down there? The air? Was the 
air bad to breathe, or...? It was pretty good. They

09:51.102 --> 09:55.810
had a fan, you know, what you call an air shaft, you 
know, on the other end of the fan, you know. Put the

09:55.830 --> 09:58.595
fresh air in and suck it out, you know. Sometimes 
it'd get bad. Sometimes it would. Had to, you know,

10:02.442 --> 10:04.085
fix it, though, you know. They make the air shafts 
or the air go, you know, circulating. Had a fan run

10:07.792 --> 10:13.963
by steam, you know, steam boiler, yeah. How did the 
Mexican workers work? Did they sing while they

10:17.661 --> 10:18.922
were working? Did they work together? Or did they 
work by themselves? Oh, each one worked

10:22.145 --> 10:23.546
separately. See, they got paid by those little 
cars, you know. They'd fill, you know, so and so

10:26.890 --> 10:28.652
much, you know. I don't remember how much they got. 
About 1,500 pounds in there. Little cars that run

10:32.936 --> 10:35.278
on little wheels, you know. Yeah. Little trucks 
put mules that pull to the shaft, you know. Right.

10:41.004 --> 10:42.065
They did work by them. The more they'd fill, you 
know, the more they'd make, you know. You see? And

10:45.584 --> 10:47.330
those other ones, they worked by the day. The other 
ones? The other ones, you know. Not one, but one to

10:50.520 --> 10:54.452
hose the coal up and down, you know. Right. Dump it 
out in the railroad car, you know. I see. Yeah. Then

10:58.443 --> 11:02.709
they had to have a man down in there, shove them cars 
on the cage, you know. So they pull it up and dump it

11:03.029 --> 11:05.933
down and let it back down. And those people, the men 
who ran the machinery were paid by the day? They

11:09.298 --> 11:10.099
were by the day. And the Mexicans and the other 
people who were down in the mines? Yeah, they

11:13.644 --> 11:15.587
worked by the car load, you know. I see. The more 
they fill, the more they make, you know. Were you a

11:19.292 --> 11:21.635
good miner when you were working down here? Did you 
mine a lot of coal every day? I didn't do much. I done

11:25.661 --> 11:27.083
pretty good, I guess, for it. my age, you know. I 
wasn't used to it much. How come you went down in the

11:32.517 --> 11:34.600
mines? What? How come you went down in the mines to 
work? Because I lived out there. You couldn't get a

11:41.930 --> 11:43.672
job working the machinery? I don't believe it. I 
wasn't old enough. I wasn't 18. I wasn't 18 yet.

11:50.982 --> 11:56.089
See, that here former, he wasn't allowed to work 
nobody unless he was 18 in the mines. I see. But that

11:56.780 --> 12:02.065
daddy fool, when he had to sign paper in case I got 
hurt or something, he couldn't complain, you

11:56.780 --> 12:02.065
know. Right. Well, do you remember Jose Morales? 
What? Do you remember Jose Morales? I don't

12:07.651 --> 12:10.594
believe I remember that Mexican. Well, he was 15 
years old in that big cave-in in 1913. The what? The

12:17.440 --> 12:18.181
cave-in. Yeah, cave-in, yeah. And he was 15 years 
old. Yeah. That was a little young then for— Yeah,

12:21.705 --> 12:25.048
it was young, but they had to— Oh, they couldn't 
work unless they was 18, you know. They had to sign

12:28.408 --> 12:31.290
in case they get hurt, you know. The boys get hurt, 
they couldn't, you know, pursue them or

12:32.151 --> 12:36.735
something, you know, complain, you know. I see. 
They took that chance, yeah. So Grandpa Vogel

12:39.958 --> 12:45.023
would make them sign these release forms. I see. Do 
you remember what the youngest Mexican worker you

12:46.144 --> 12:50.448
saw down there was? Adam B. was in it, and he owned 
it, that Adam B. And then Jose was in the Adam B. How

12:57.142 --> 12:58.885
did they use the mules? Did they take them down in 
the morning and bring them back? Yeah, bring them

13:01.709 --> 13:03.512
up back in the evening, yeah. Take them down and 
bring them back in the evening. Were they big

13:07.579 --> 13:09.302
mules, little mules? About medium size. About 
medium size, okay.

13:15.472 --> 13:19.118
Were they easy animals to work with? What? Were 
they easy animals? Yeah, they were easy tame

13:20.480 --> 13:23.605
mules. But they had many of them. They knew what to 
do, you know, what they had to do. Would you hitch

13:28.597 --> 13:31.621
the mule up to the small coal car? Yeah, car, and 
they'd pull it, you know. To the shaft? To the

13:34.666 --> 13:35.567
shaft, yeah. On the north side, they didn't have to 
hitch them in that way, going downhill and cool

13:36.949 --> 13:44.700
ones this way and that way, you know. To the east it 
goes downhill and south it goes down. This way goes

13:47.745 --> 13:49.267
up, you know. They had to pull the cars up here with 
the mules. It's just ridiculous, you know, coming

13:51.749 --> 13:57.318
down the road and down the side pushing. Was 
anybody hurt when you were down working in the

13:57.338 --> 13:59.902
mine? No, not that I know

13:59.922 --> 14:05.170
of. Did you pretty much stay to your own house or did 
you have Mexican friends when you were little? You

14:14.545 --> 14:17.390
know, did you socialize with them? Yeah, we got 
along with them, yeah. We didn't run around with

14:19.559 --> 14:24.165
some, you know, but there's some camp there, you 
know. How far away was the camp, the Mexican camp,

14:24.185 --> 14:28.471
from your house? Oh, it was close. It went too far. 
Some houses, some houses were, you know, some were

14:32.556 --> 14:35.740
close. What, about 50 yards or something like 
that? Yeah. Did, what kind of entertainment did

14:42.088 --> 14:45.613
the Mexicans have? Do you remember that? Did they 
sing or... If they had weddings, they'd dance, you

14:49.445 --> 14:53.409
know. They'd sing something. They would play 
guitar,

14:55.231 --> 14:59.775
you know. Let me ask you this. What, you know, 
mining must be really hard work. What? Mining must

15:05.461 --> 15:06.722
be really hard work. Yeah, it's hard work, yeah. So 
what did you eat, you know, in the morning before

15:08.104 --> 15:13.890
you went to the mine, and then at dinner, and then at 
supper? What kind of food did you eat? Ah, we just

15:15.736 --> 15:19.100
had like cream of wheat or something like that, you 
know. And for breakfast? Yeah. And what about for

15:21.042 --> 15:22.003
dinner? Ah, chicken or something else, like that 
meat, you know. Would you come up out of the mine to

15:27.248 --> 15:32.534
eat, or did you eat your dinner down in the mine? I 
came on home, then I went back. I see. And then for

15:37.520 --> 15:39.702
supper, what did you have? You wasn't in the mine 
much. You was just with Daddy. I told him I wasn't in

15:43.886 --> 15:45.388
that much. He was too young yet. I worked in a little 
while. I worked in a little while. They're not

15:51.686 --> 16:00.458
allowed to take their children or their sons down 
there to work unless, you know, they give

15:51.686 --> 16:00.458
permission. They have to be 18. They have to be 18 
before they can work in there, the boys. Unless

16:06.828 --> 16:09.011
their parents want to, you know. Right. Because if 
they might get hurt, they could sue them. This way

16:13.898 --> 16:15.460
they couldn't do that. By the way, are you Willie's 
wife? No, just a sister. I'm the second oldest.

16:22.725 --> 16:24.287
There's two girls. I've got a sister who lives 
uptown. She's a year older than I am. We're the two

16:29.755 --> 16:30.516
oldest. Then comes Willie. Are you Louise? 
Uh-huh. Louise Lawrence? Do y'all remember

16:37.285 --> 16:39.228
Gustav Vogel? Yes, she's our cousin. Your cousin. 
Gustav Miller. Why, you know her? No, I don't. I

16:46.824 --> 16:47.946
just, I heard about her. I was talking to Miss Beth 
the other day. Yes, she's my cousin. She's Gus

16:52.777 --> 16:54.461
Vogel's daughter. Is she still alive by any 
chance? Oh, no, she died 30 years ago or something

16:56.907 --> 17:01.998
like that. No, I may be. I understand she ran a 
little school for the Mexican children there.

17:07.290 --> 17:07.511
Yes. Do you remember anything? I don't know 
anything about the school business. I just know

17:12.016 --> 17:18.644
that Billy was out there at the mining camps too, 
and she'd come out there. She lived in town. Right.

17:21.247 --> 17:29.136
And she'd come out there and she'd teach them, but I 
don't know anything else about it. I guess they

17:29.156 --> 17:31.980
learned their English from Augusta. Uh-huh. You 
lived out at the mines with women. Do you remember?

17:39.646 --> 17:42.109
The whole family of us lived out there. My mother 
and dad and 14 children. 12 children, I think.

17:47.837 --> 17:50.080
There's 14 of us in all of them. My goodness. Do you 
remember any interesting stories, humor stories

17:52.303 --> 17:56.749
out there? You know, growing up or when you were 
older? Oh, well, we just played ball a whole lot. We

18:03.317 --> 18:14.530
went crawfishing in the caves, and friends would 
come out there, and we'd play marbles, and

18:03.317 --> 18:14.530
anything a boy would play, we'd play, too. Were 
most of your friends... We were mostly boys. Were

18:19.836 --> 18:24.862
most of your friends... We were nine girls, nine 
girls and three boys in our family. How did you put

18:25.202 --> 18:30.088
up with that, Willie?

18:31.570 --> 18:33.492
Were most of your friends in Rockdale? Oh, yeah, we 
know everybody in Rockdale. Did you have any

18:36.276 --> 18:39.279
friends out at the mine? Well, they wasn't just 
grown folks. They had very few children. Willie

18:47.429 --> 18:50.412
Helfer was one of them. Yeah, I talked to Willie 
yesterday. Yeah, he was my oldest sister's age, I

18:53.716 --> 18:58.422
believe. or a year older, and he and Willie chummed 
a lot. He'd come to our house, he and his folks.

19:09.070 --> 19:14.556
There wasn't very many white folks living out 
there, mostly, and Mexicans. Right. And we didn't

19:15.517 --> 19:18.941
have nothing to do with it. Oh, you didn't? Chum 
rockin' things out of maybe. Willie was telling me

19:25.435 --> 19:29.221
he learned Mexican, you know, the Spanish 
language really. Yeah. Daddy did too, and mother,

19:30.543 --> 19:35.750
and I can speak pretty good. I can tell you the name 
of any kind of vegetable. We sold them vegetables.

19:41.659 --> 19:44.003
We had a little express wagon, you know. Did you 
have a garden out by your house there? Yeah, we had a

19:46.026 --> 19:49.291
big garden and lots of pretty flowers. Daddy was a 
flower lover. He had lots of pretty flowers. We

19:54.123 --> 19:58.668
kids had to do the watering, you know. Well, did the 
Mexicans have their own gardens, too? Some, but

20:01.771 --> 20:03.773
they grown mostly... Hot peppers. Hot peppers 
and... Squash. Squash, something like that.

20:12.882 --> 20:15.184
Squash and what do you call them, cassaws? That's 
what they grown mostly. But you didn't have very

20:19.428 --> 20:21.731
much contact with the Mexicans? No, no. As far as 
speaking with them, you know, like you and I

20:23.907 --> 20:29.516
together, we couldn't do that. Oh, really? But we 
learned, you know, like good morning, good

20:30.758 --> 20:38.510
evening, and any kind of vegetable. Any kind of 
vegetable. Did many of them learn? We had cattle.

20:43.578 --> 20:46.543
We had cows, and we sold them milk and butter.

20:49.688 --> 20:51.611
And they paid you cash for it? Uh-huh. Did you trade 
at the commissary store? Yeah, there was a little

20:56.072 --> 21:03.306
one right in our house, our grandmother's house.

21:03.326 --> 21:06.112
And we did trading there. And they also had, in 
those days, The meat market in town here, he had a

21:12.760 --> 21:20.493
wagon team, and he'd come out there selling meat, 
go around the camp, sell meat. The ice man would

21:20.513 --> 21:22.356
come out and sell ice. The silver water man would 
come out there and sell soda water. The ice cream

21:26.383 --> 21:30.270
man would come out there. The lady sold bonnets and 
clothing. She'd come out there, take orders. You

21:38.900 --> 21:41.863
know, anybody that had something to sell had to 
come out there. Even the man at Christmas time

21:42.444 --> 21:46.548
would come with a whole load of Christmas trees. 
Oh, wow. And the Mexicans would buy Christmas

21:48.130 --> 21:50.433
trees? Yeah, yeah. Some of them had horses and 
buggies of their own, and some didn't. We all

22:00.043 --> 22:03.287
walked the town a lot, you know. I said it was three 
miles. I don't know how far it was. It really was.

22:10.412 --> 22:11.894
I'd say it was three miles. And we'd walk along the 
railroad or along the dirt road. It wasn't but a

22:18.122 --> 22:20.565
dirt road. It wasn't down then. But after 1919, 
y'all didn't do any more mining? No, we moved out

22:25.731 --> 22:29.416
here then, 1919. Do you prefer farming to mining? 
Yes. Why is that? Well, the doctor told Daddy he had

22:36.319 --> 22:41.105
to get out of that hole. He wouldn't live there 
long. Why was that?

22:46.211 --> 22:48.694
Did he pick up a disease or something? No, you know, 
but... He'd always get headaches, so I guess that A

22:49.735 --> 22:52.038
in there. The gas, you know, mines have gas in them. 
Yeah, the headache, you know. So your Daddy went

22:56.784 --> 22:58.466
down in the mine? Uh-huh. He was a... kind of boss of 
the Mexicans. Grandfather made him boss. Did he

23:06.465 --> 23:08.189
have any trouble with Mexicans? No. That's where 
he learned to speak Spanish, you know. I see.

23:17.709 --> 23:18.511
We're German. Right. And we could speak, us older 
kids all learned how to speak German. And then we

23:26.133 --> 23:30.162
learned how to speak some Spanish and English. We 
could speak three languages. Grandmother used

23:34.010 --> 23:39.964
to, in the First World War I was on, She took German 
newspapers. And her children all got married and

23:43.342 --> 23:49.112
left home and left her there by herself. So mother 
said, from now on, you and Martha are going to have

23:49.132 --> 23:58.508
to go one night you go, stay with them, and the other 
night Louise go and stay with them. So we did that.

24:00.700 --> 24:05.768
Every night she'd read the news to us in German, you 
know, tell us what it's about. About the war. And I

24:07.732 --> 24:10.496
got so I really could live, too. The newspaper 
writing, you know, print is more like in German.

24:16.917 --> 24:21.802
But letter writing has got too many hooks and 
crooks I see. I never did learn how to write it or

24:21.822 --> 24:25.125
read it either. Only thing I can read is Dear 
Friend, Dear Friend, Leave a Friend. That's all I

24:29.229 --> 24:30.370
can read. Well, when you left the mines, did you 
pretty much forget about the mines? Or did you keep

24:35.455 --> 24:36.936
in contact? Yeah, we kind of forgot after a while. 
Well, mostly all the mines closed up then, didn't

24:41.180 --> 24:43.842
they? Yeah.

24:47.056 --> 24:49.720
Yeah, they closed up in the Depression, pretty 
much. They closed up during the 1930s. They got oil

24:53.146 --> 24:57.793
afterwards and they couldn't sell any more coal, 
you know. They got oil cheaper, you know, cleaner.

25:01.880 --> 25:03.222
Couldn't sell any more coal. Couldn't make no 
money. What do you think about shale oil coming in

25:05.486 --> 25:09.613
now and running again? You know, shale oil coming 
in again. Yeah, I guess all right now. coal would be

25:13.111 --> 25:15.834
worse, you know, and the oil is so high now. Them, 
they could get oil cheap, you know. Get oil

25:19.357 --> 25:20.918
cheaper. Did you use coal in your stove in your 
house? We used it in the heater. We used lignite

25:25.943 --> 25:28.025
coal in the heater. But you didn't use it to cook 
with? No, not the cook stove. Had lots of timber

25:32.709 --> 25:34.030
there. They made their own ties, what you call it, 
little ties to put the railroad on. And they made

25:40.432 --> 25:42.054
their own. They had a little saw mill, too, there, 
right at the boiler house. And they used steam out

25:48.940 --> 25:51.303
of the boiler, you know. Right, right. And made 
their own ties. And then what they cut off, you

25:54.386 --> 26:01.533
know, they'd cut into blocks for us for stove wood, 
for grandmother and us. And they'd haul it up to the

26:02.914 --> 26:04.716
house. And we kids would chop it in sizes for the 
stove. That sounds good. Do you remember anything

26:10.368 --> 26:16.815
about, I know you worked at the Vogel Mines, you 
know, for the first 19 years, or you lived there. Do

26:17.316 --> 26:20.340
you remember anything about the Texas Coal 
Company? Texas Coal Company, where was that at?

26:23.824 --> 26:28.049
Down here, just south of 79, it's about a mile down. 
Yeah, I know. They were all around there. Yeah,

26:29.831 --> 26:30.712
down in that bay. But which one was the Texas Coal 
Company? But I don't remember. It was... where the

26:35.765 --> 26:39.590
Rogel mine was up on the hill, the Stribble mine. 
The Texas might have been on the other side,

26:39.650 --> 26:43.896
further down, you know, further east. Seemed like 
it was. Further east, yeah, down in there.

26:49.564 --> 26:52.087
There's the Rogel, Texas mine. In the north of the 
coal mine, it is up this way, across the railroad.

26:56.373 --> 26:58.636
The Whirly mine, the Big Lump mine. Big Lump was 
down at what side of the creek, which was the land,

26:58.896 --> 27:04.744
you know, on the north side of the railroad. Close 
to the That's close to where Texas Coal is south of

27:06.072 --> 27:10.139
Sandy Creek. Yeah, what is? The Texas Coal Company 
was south of Sandy Creek. Yeah, that might have

27:13.805 --> 27:16.589
been, yeah, that might have been in Texas down in 
there. The one of mine, Dr. Dunkey had a mine. There

27:22.419 --> 27:24.983
was some more of mine, but I don't remember there. I 
was too young, you know, for the early, maybe, I

27:25.123 --> 27:29.751
don't know. I did remember all the names, but I 
can't think of them all right now. I'm getting old

27:34.376 --> 27:35.537
too. I'm forgetting. Well, that's what we're 
trying to do here is get all that information down.

27:41.464 --> 27:46.469
I said whenever we all be gone, the younger folks 
won't know a thing about it. When you tell them now

27:46.970 --> 27:52.897
about it, they look at you like you're telling them 
a fib or something. I don't know. They're too much

27:55.099 --> 27:56.781
in a hurry nowadays, I guess. Too much in a hurry. So 
you don't miss the coal mining. You'd much rather

28:01.012 --> 28:03.457
be a farmer.

28:05.560 --> 28:08.345
Well, we couldn't get in that age. We ain't going to 
be much of anything, I presume. Y'all look pretty

28:12.593 --> 28:13.915
spry to me. What happened to your old house there at 
the Vogel Mine? After a while, they tore it down.

28:21.148 --> 28:22.570
When grandmother died, They tore it down and built 
another room onto her house. That's Grandmother

28:27.768 --> 28:29.109
Vogel. Uh-huh. And we moved in there. We lived in 
there until we moved over here. Then Gus Vogel

28:34.775 --> 28:36.436
moved out there. Uncle Gus, he moved in that house 
after he died afterwards. He moved out here, Henry

28:42.482 --> 28:44.624
Brown, you know. His daughter married Henry 
Brown, B-R-A-H-M, Brown. Right. He lives west of

28:49.589 --> 28:51.671
town, right? No, right here. Right out here. Right 
over there, Underpass. Underpass, you know.

28:57.770 --> 28:58.631
Across the railroad. But he passed away last year. 
If you go to that one boy, he could take you out

29:03.880 --> 29:08.247
there. He owned all that old land, most of it. He 
could take you down to the mines, show you some of

29:11.052 --> 29:13.115
them. But Underpass here. Right. It's right on the 
right, on the south side of the Raywood. You can see

29:19.317 --> 29:20.299
the house. It's a trailer house sitting there. It 
is close to the Raywood, Ron Henry Brown. He's not

29:25.887 --> 29:26.748
there all the way. He works on the Raywood most of 
the time. John Henry. John Henry. He's the only one

29:31.054 --> 29:35.020
left of that family in. John Henry? Yeah. You say he 
might be there today? He had bad luck last year.

29:41.255 --> 29:51.090
Henry Bromiself died, his son died, and then his 
wife ran into a bus here, and she got killed. And all

29:51.951 --> 29:53.573
that's left is John Henry? John Henry and her, his 
brother's wife's children. I believe there's two

30:00.424 --> 30:02.908
of them, two boys. So Robert doesn't live there 
anymore? Robert and I. Okay.

30:09.790 --> 30:12.173
Yeah, well, that one boy used to go out to sea. I 
don't know. He's not there always. He works on the

30:14.837 --> 30:18.802
railroad, you know, at Taylor. Then he comes in. 
Sometimes he has to stay at night, you know. See,

30:23.369 --> 30:26.253
John Henry's mother was our cousin, too. That was 
Augusta Vogel's sister. I see. John Henry, that

30:30.558 --> 30:35.545
was Augusta Vogel. That was her mama. That was his 
mama. Minner, Minner, yeah, not Gustav Minner.

30:42.539 --> 30:45.423
Minner Roper, that was, Minner and Gustav were 
sisters, you know. That's M-I-N-A. Uh-huh. Yeah,

30:47.526 --> 30:52.373
Minner, yeah, that was, Minner, that was his mom, 
Minner Roper.

30:55.437 --> 30:58.762
He seemed like, he was a real pet. Yeah, Henry 
Brown, he owned most of that land out there, and he

30:59.744 --> 31:08.957
might take you on to the old, Richard's mine, 
that's just right from his house, that direction,

31:09.545 --> 31:14.090
you know, not too far.

31:17.593 --> 31:21.437
One thing I want to ask, how did y'all get medical 
service out there tonight? Oh, they had a company

31:21.457 --> 31:26.142
doctor, you know, in Rockdale. A company doctor, 
he'd come out there every two weeks, each Mexican,

31:27.023 --> 31:35.572
he had a family, he had to pay 50 cents every payday, 
you know. And Daddy didn't pay too, you know, every

31:36.258 --> 31:40.885
two weeks paid that doctor 50 cents. And if 
somebody gets sick and he had to come on out, it

31:41.105 --> 31:45.011
would cost him any more, you know. It wouldn't cost 
him? No, any more, no. Anyway, where's the

31:47.354 --> 31:48.976
medicine? At the drugstore. It was made out there. 
They paid so much a month, and they got the medicine

31:50.899 --> 31:57.148
for so much. Where did they get their medicine? At 
the commissary? No, at Tom's. At the drugstore.
