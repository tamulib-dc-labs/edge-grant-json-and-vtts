00:06.528 --> 00:11.733
Okay, Mr. Rogers, what was your job at the Austin 
American Statement? Well, I had a lot of jobs over a

00:11.753 --> 00:15.436
period of time. I was there from 1952 until 1968. 
The last job that I had was managing editor, and in

00:17.799 --> 00:36.096
previous to that I had been an assistant city 
editor, I had been a copy editor, I had been a

00:17.799 --> 00:36.096
reporter, but most of my time was spent either as as 
an assistant city editor or as management editor.

00:48.733 --> 00:54.339
Could you describe Austin in the 1960s as far as the 
race situation and the general attitude? Well, I

00:56.562 --> 01:06.252
think Austin was

00:56.562 --> 01:06.252
caught up in the changes that were going on like 
other places and in some ways it was a a site of

01:07.565 --> 01:10.830
ferment. And there are a couple of reasons for 
that. One is that the Austin leadership and I think

01:16.197 --> 01:24.188
Austin attitudes traditionally were really 
rather on the conservative side. And but there was

01:26.512 --> 01:31.699
at the same time a very strong liberal element in 
the community, mostly associated with the

01:32.810 --> 01:39.240
University of Texas and especially with the 
University of Texas students. Of course, there

01:39.560 --> 01:42.004
are also faculty there.

01:45.169 --> 01:56.426
But I think there also was a determination on the 
part of the city's political leadership to see to

01:45.169 --> 01:56.426
it that the law was carried out in the best way 
possible. So while certainly there were tensions

01:56.506 --> 02:00.252
in the town, as far as the integration of lunch 
counters and restrooms and public facilities

02:00.923 --> 02:13.016
like hotels and theaters and things like that. 
There also was a strong force in the town acting on

02:13.056 --> 02:21.445
behalf of integration. And the political 
leadership saw to it that the police department

02:28.244 --> 02:39.935
whatever their own personal biases might be, 
behaved in a fashion to protect the rights of

02:28.244 --> 02:39.935
people who were sitting in at lunch counters or 
conducting marches or things like that. And so

02:40.716 --> 02:48.864
actually, I think there was a minimum of trouble, a 
lot less than there could have been and a lot less

02:40.716 --> 02:48.864
than there were in other places. What was the 
attitude of the public towards the media? Well, I

02:53.148 --> 02:57.492
think that Just in a general way, I think that the 
American Statesman and the television station

02:58.889 --> 03:12.630
suffered

02:58.889 --> 03:12.630
the same fate that most local media do. You know, 
most people don't really like their own, or say

03:13.452 --> 03:19.441
they don't like their own hometown newspapers, 
their own hometown TV. The assumption is that

03:19.501 --> 03:23.487
somewhere else people are all doing a better job. 
There are a good many people who

03:27.914 --> 03:56.267
had negative feelings toward the newspaper 
because we didn't do this or we didn't do that but

03:27.914 --> 03:56.267
but in that regard i don't think there was anything 
special about that i think that was just the

03:27.914 --> 03:56.267
generalized kind of an attitude that 
particularly monopoly media suffer in any town

03:27.914 --> 03:56.267
and i don't think it's changed all that much i think 
it still goes on it's really tough to be honored in

03:27.914 --> 03:56.267
your own town if you're in the news business when 
did you notice Important changes come in the 60s as

03:56.703 --> 04:01.483
far as race.

04:04.495 --> 04:06.443
Oh, I have no way in the world of... pinpointing 
that on our memory for dates and all that kind of

04:06.862 --> 04:13.208
thing. But of course, Austin was pretty 
consistent with all of the things that were going

04:13.268 --> 04:21.436
on elsewhere in the country. And particularly 
after, especially after Kennedy's

04:21.476 --> 04:30.545
assassination in 1963, things moved very fast. 
They moved very fast in Austin than they did

04:30.565 --> 04:34.168
everywhere else. And in some ways, I suppose, 
Austin

04:34.452 --> 04:57.533
felt particularly close to these changes in the 
sense that Lyndon Johnson, who was essentially a

04:34.452 --> 04:57.533
local man, was the prime mover behind the great 
Russian civil rights legislation that took place

04:34.452 --> 04:57.533
after the Kennedy assassination. And so I think 
civil rights was a matter that was much on the local

04:57.553 --> 05:03.598
minds and Mr. Johnson, of course, flew into Austin 
when he came to the White House on 3rd and Alice. So I

05:10.726 --> 05:16.744
think there was an acute awareness of everything 
that was going on. Certainly, we can mark lots of

05:17.315 --> 05:23.764
social change in this country from the Kennedy 
assassination. It had been beginning before

05:23.784 --> 05:26.869
that, but that gave it that great impetus. And then 
the events that followed that, which was suddenly

05:26.949 --> 05:38.265
the assassination of Robert Kennedy and Martin 
Luther King and everything, and the whole

05:26.949 --> 05:38.265
business, and the March on Washington and all 
that. It was just, Austin was caught up in it like

05:38.285 --> 05:40.588
the whole nation.

05:46.238 --> 05:51.747
Well, how was student unrest at

05:46.238 --> 05:51.747
the University of Texas? Well, I can't... Boy, 
that seems like 10 million years ago somehow.

05:59.800 --> 06:09.076
There was student unrest, but I don't recall that 
it took any particularly insidious forms. There

06:09.156 --> 06:09.917
were... There were students who joined in 
demonstrations about everything that came

06:12.462 --> 06:24.476
along, but I don't recall that we had any really 
serious confrontations of any kind. And there

06:25.717 --> 06:35.128
were times when there were rather volatile 
speakers like Rap Brown and others who came, and

06:25.717 --> 06:35.128
they came in and got out with minor. I think the most 
obvious thing about the students at the

06:36.560 --> 06:49.499
University of Texas at that time was their

06:36.560 --> 06:49.499
apparent difference from the rest of the 
population. The alternative lifestyle business

06:49.560 --> 06:54.587
was starting. Everybody was trying to see how 
scroungy you could look, and there was long hair,

06:54.807 --> 07:04.542
and open smoking a pot, and all those kinds of 
things that so outraged the established

07:04.792 --> 07:30.983
established them in those days and of course the 
University of Texas was the center of that and some

07:04.792 --> 07:30.983
really you know you would hardly even pay any 
attention to them now but at that time it was like

07:04.792 --> 07:30.983
watching a freak show out on Guadalupe when you 
walked by the University because you know we've

07:04.792 --> 07:30.983
not seen this kind of thing before and so I think 
maybe that was the most obvious thing that was

07:04.792 --> 07:30.983
going on. Well on this students How, was there any 
newspaper bias towards them? One way or the other?

07:37.651 --> 07:38.431
One way or the other.

07:44.098 --> 07:47.502
I really can't, I can't recall that there was. We 
had a,

07:47.562 --> 07:58.795
I'm sure that in some of the ways that we handled 
some stories in the beginning, that we probably

07:59.905 --> 08:06.011
were careless about the use of the word like hippie 
and things like that. But I don't think there was

08:08.334 --> 08:23.690
any deliberate attempt on the part of the 
newspaper either to put these people down or to

08:08.334 --> 08:23.690
unduly support whatever their attitudes might be 
and whatnot.

08:27.034 --> 08:29.136
Lord knows my memory may be faulty, I can't recall 
that there was any particular difficulty one way

08:29.723 --> 08:35.950
or the other. It seems to me that we treated that 
like any other news phenomenon that was going on.

08:41.756 --> 08:52.328
And unconsciously, we probably wrote in ways that 
were derogatory and whatnot, although I don't

08:41.756 --> 08:52.328
think it was a deliberate kind of thing. I think 
it's kind of like the unconscious sexism that we

08:52.368 --> 08:58.515
still fall into just because we don't even think 
about it.

09:05.363 --> 09:09.990
Was there any rioting in Austin? No, not rioting in 
the sense that it happened anywhere else. We

09:14.597 --> 09:19.885
didn't, you know, the town was never set on fire or 
the streets weren't blocked or anything like

09:14.597 --> 09:19.885
that. Partly it was,

09:21.307 --> 09:33.345
largely I think it was because the police by and 
large did not make bad mistakes in handling these

09:21.307 --> 09:33.345
things. For example, when there were 
demonstrations, parades, and things like that,

09:34.810 --> 09:43.638
the police chief kept his riot squads out of sight. 
He didn't do the kinds of things that might have

09:43.819 --> 09:46.761
provoked things. And they were pretty careful 
about being sure that people who were heckling the

09:47.162 --> 09:58.893
paraders and that sort of thing or were trying to 
cause trouble when blacks were sitting in at the

09:47.162 --> 09:58.893
lunch counter. That seems impossible, I guess. 
Only a few years ago. you know, they saw to it that

10:04.595 --> 10:12.862
people were able to exercise their rights to 
parade and to demonstrate and sit in if they wanted

10:04.595 --> 10:12.862
to and all that sort of thing. So I think it was 
managed pretty well, and there certainly was

10:12.882 --> 10:19.488
nothing that I recall that even approached a riot. 
Certainly nothing like the kinds of things that

10:20.048 --> 10:26.053
went on in Detroit and places like that. Well, how 
many demonstrations and sit-ins were there? Good

10:29.576 --> 10:30.477
grief. I have no idea. You know, it was just The most

10:35.965 --> 11:04.588
obvious thing in terms of sit-ins that I remember 
was that for a series of weekends, the NCAA or

10:35.965 --> 11:04.588
whoever they were were regularly conducting 
sit-ins

10:35.965 --> 11:04.588
at lunch counters like at Woolworth's. in 
downtown down on the course at that time with the

11:05.159 --> 11:11.068
six in Congress. And there were, of course, people 
who showed up to jeer and all that kind of thing, but

11:11.088 --> 11:17.297
the police kept it under control. And so, by and 
large, I think it happened with a minimum of

11:17.397 --> 11:25.750
difficulty considering the total difficulty 
that was going on in the country at the time. And how

11:26.438 --> 11:28.100
many demonstrations were there? Gosh, I don't 
know. It seemed like somebody was always showing

11:29.221 --> 11:34.946
up on the steps of the Capitol or having a parade 
down Congress Avenue or something. But I suppose

11:34.966 --> 11:45.817
that one of the reasons my memory is sort of dim 
about these things is because they were almost

11:34.966 --> 11:45.817
routine and they weren't just really not that 
upsetting. They were just routine. In the

11:49.501 --> 11:51.703
newsroom, what kind of coverage? We covered them. 
We always covered those things. We always had

11:55.237 --> 11:57.079
reporters out. But we were there more like you 
conduct a death watch when a famous person was

11:58.000 --> 12:03.685
getting ready to die. We were there in case 
anything happened, you know, as much as anything

12:03.725 --> 12:07.049
else. And we reported on them, and we ran 
photographs, and we reported such incidents as

12:07.109 --> 12:18.540
there were and whatnot, but, you know, we just 
handled them like any other news story that was

12:07.109 --> 12:18.540
going on. We neither... We neither... fomented 
them

12:22.126 --> 12:27.415
or made a big deal out of them.

12:30.760 --> 12:47.909
About the rise of the counterculture or the hippie 
and the race riots, how much was it discussed among

12:30.760 --> 12:47.909
journalists

12:30.760 --> 12:47.909
in the newsroom?

12:47.969 --> 12:48.049
Hmm.

12:52.045 --> 12:59.255
I suppose that it was discussed in the same terms 
that we discussed any other kind of news that was

12:52.045 --> 12:59.255
going on. I don't think that we... I don't recall 
people sitting around and philosophizing and

13:01.318 --> 13:09.109
saying, gosh, I was down on the street today and I 
believe the counterculture is rising. You know,

13:10.591 --> 13:13.576
this, after all, was an evolutionary kind of a 
thing. It happened rapidly, but still and all,

13:13.636 --> 13:17.361
it's not the kind of thing that... And of course, 
our people were aware of what was going on. And

13:22.302 --> 13:26.447
partly, it depended on what kind of a beat you were 
covering. I'm sure that the business writers had

13:26.807 --> 13:33.315
one view of the thing, and the police writers had 
another view of the thing, and so on. But I think, by

13:33.395 --> 13:48.613
and large, as far as our newsroom is concerned, 
that

13:33.395 --> 13:48.613
there was a considerable amount of tolerance for 
the kind of change that was going on, certainly

13:33.395 --> 13:48.613
among the working news people. We

13:49.488 --> 14:14.179
were observers of the scene day by day, and I 
suppose because we were, in a sense, we may have

13:49.488 --> 14:14.179
been less

13:49.488 --> 14:14.179
inclined

14:16.589 --> 14:19.553
to comment on it than maybe some other people. I 
mean, as I recall now that's far away from it,

14:19.673 --> 14:33.511
whatever it was we said about it or thought about it 
was pretty generally in terms of coverage we were

14:19.673 --> 14:33.511
giving to it. You know, just another day at the 
office for us, I

14:33.531 --> 14:40.960
think.

14:44.146 --> 14:50.374
As far as the editorial policies and such that when 
there was no bias one way or the other. That's a very

14:52.456 --> 14:54.899
difficult thing to recall.

14:57.002 --> 15:07.335
I'm have no doubt, though I don't actually have a 
memory of it that we may have had editorial from

14:57.002 --> 15:07.335
time to time suggested that the street people were 
clogging up things and ought to be controlled a

15:08.075 --> 15:36.445
little bit better out around the university and we 
may have had some funny things objecting to the way

15:08.075 --> 15:36.445
they dressed and we may have had some 
anti-narcotics editorials and things like that

15:08.075 --> 15:36.445
but as far as saying that you know taking any kind of 
a staunchly anti-counterculture stand and

15:08.075 --> 15:36.445
abhorring the state of it well we didn't do that and 
we certainly were editorially convinced that

15:37.100 --> 15:44.446
racial integration was the right thing.

15:50.792 --> 15:58.999
Wherever bias occurred in coverage and so on was 
unconscious personal bias and certainly was not

15:50.792 --> 15:58.999
an institutional bias.

16:02.322 --> 16:05.925
At this time, also, Vietnam was going on. What kind 
of coverage was given to Vietnam, say, before

16:06.277 --> 16:10.624
1964? Well, Vietnam coverage was we didn't have 
anybody in Vietnam from our own staff or from our

16:11.505 --> 16:20.319
own organization. So what our coverage was the 
coverage that the Associated Press and the United

16:20.339 --> 16:28.091
Press International were giving to the war. And we 
pretty regularly gave it a prominent position

16:35.116 --> 16:44.468
quite often was a lead story, but that's true of any 
war, because copy editors, by and large, are lazy,

16:35.116 --> 16:44.468
and the war is always a safe thing to put on top. And 
so our coverage reflected what was reflected in

16:45.950 --> 16:51.917
the coverage generally. In the beginning, we 
covered it the way we had covered wars in the past.

16:56.102 --> 17:03.672
We pretty much accepted that in terms of the 
coverage that we were getting, It was us and them,

17:04.377 --> 17:10.028
and there was to be a winning side and a losing side, 
and we wanted to win. The traditional view, we'd

17:10.949 --> 17:19.646
had a war, and our view and our coverage began to 
change as the nation's view and coverage began to

17:10.949 --> 17:19.646
change. When it became apparent that the 
commanders in the field were lying about almost

17:19.686 --> 17:26.098
everything they could think of, and that 
Politically, it was a hopeless mire that nobody

17:26.500 --> 17:37.073
really understood what the war was about, that 
there was a great deal of unnecessary cruelty

17:26.500 --> 17:37.073
among the sides, and then the meat line business 
and all that kind of thing. So there was nothing

17:38.095 --> 17:46.125
really different in terms of our approaches or our 
attitudes or our coverage, I think, than there was

17:38.095 --> 17:46.125
generally nationally. But in fact, we had very 
little control over that because we were merely

17:51.442 --> 17:54.947
really using what was coming to us from the war and 
whatnot. And we had the same kind of arguments

17:56.369 --> 18:09.367
among people in our staff that the people in the 
United States generally were having about

17:56.369 --> 18:09.367
whether we ought to stay or whether we ought to get 
out or whether we ought to bomb the gooks or, you

17:56.369 --> 18:09.367
know, the kind of thing that went on. And there were 
some who, of course, felt that the war was immoral.

18:15.185 --> 18:21.313
There were people who personally sympathized 
with the young men who were fleeing Canada and all

18:15.185 --> 18:21.313
that kind of thing. There were others who felt the 
opposite. As far as the coverage was concerned, we

18:23.356 --> 18:33.229
were virtually, we were really captives of the 
wire services because we certainly didn't have

18:23.356 --> 18:33.229
any resources there. There have been some studies 
done of newspapers in Texas, and they found that

18:40.227 --> 18:53.471
stories about American losses in Vietnam, at 
least in the earlier days, were played down and

18:40.227 --> 18:53.471
given a less prominent position than they were in, 
say, New York or the Washington Post. Could be. I'm

18:54.032 --> 18:55.915
really not familiar with the studies. And if

18:57.298 --> 19:04.210
our newspaper reflected that, It was totally 
accidental, and it was based simply on the choices

19:04.949 --> 19:11.278
of whoever happened to be working on those things. 
I can assure you that there was no institutional

19:11.839 --> 19:21.472
policy which said, we're going to downplay our 
losses and upplay their losses. Such a

19:22.013 --> 19:24.176
conversation simply never took place. Nobody 
ever thought about it. The judgments that were

19:26.399 --> 19:31.467
made in terms of the play on the stories were simply 
the judgments of whoever happened to be in the

19:26.399 --> 19:31.467
slot. It's that simple. Whether it turned out that 
statistically you could establish that kind of

19:34.835 --> 19:41.986
bias or not, I have no idea. But if so, it was a mere 
happenstance. When the war started becoming

19:46.753 --> 19:56.407
unpopular, how much of a stance did the newspaper 
take editorially? I have no memory of it. I'm

19:57.589 --> 19:58.070
sorry. I simply do not recall. back in the 1960s 
when things were changing were journalists

20:01.970 --> 20:30.795
attitudes change yeah i think journalists 
attitudes began to change i think that by and large

20:01.970 --> 20:30.795
among working journalists there was a greater 
tolerance for change i think there was a greater

20:01.970 --> 20:30.795
empathy with the counterculture people i think 
there was a greater sense of of the wrongness of the

20:31.079 --> 20:34.303
Vietnam War. And I think, in general, probably, 
the journalists I knew, at least, tended to be more

20:34.683 --> 20:47.439
what Lucille categorized as liberal in their 
attitudes, I suppose. And I think, by and large, in

20:47.459 --> 20:58.453
their own personal attitudes, they were out a 
little bit ahead, maybe, of the public at large on

20:47.459 --> 20:58.453
those things. Having said that, I haven't said 
anything very startling. I think that's true

21:01.086 --> 21:04.112
almost universally. I don't think that those 
newsroom attitudes, however, necessarily have

21:05.093 --> 21:20.762
any great impact on the content or the play of news, 
because I think this is countervailed by the fact

21:20.962 --> 21:27.650
publishers, by and large, tend to have an opposite 
political and philosophical and social

21:20.962 --> 21:27.650
orientation. So I think, you know, a few things 
kind of play against each other, and you wind up

21:28.351 --> 21:40.246
with a kind of a neutrality, I think, as far as play 
and everything.

21:40.266 --> 21:47.155
It's hard for people on the outside to cope with, 
but,

21:40.266 --> 21:47.155
you know, I'd be The President's personal 
attitudes as reporters are under a little bit

21:47.843 --> 21:54.653
better control, I think, than a lot of the public 
likes to believe. In fact, you are able to set those

21:54.853 --> 22:02.044
things aside and keep overt bias. You cannot keep 
unconscious bias out, no question about that. But

22:06.250 --> 22:11.438
I think you do keep overt bias out on things like 
that.

22:13.882 --> 22:30.977
So I think what I remember from the 60s was a 
difference that is a kind of a consistent

22:13.882 --> 22:30.977
difference between news people and perhaps a 
larger public turns their own personal

22:13.882 --> 22:30.977
attitudes.

22:30.997 --> 22:34.260
Back to the demonstrations for a minute. Were 
there any instances where there was threat of a

22:34.680 --> 22:43.568
demonstration and your newspaper was concerned 
about the way they play the story and the effect

22:44.003 --> 23:09.943
that the coverage would give well the most obvious 
example that i recall was a situation in which at

22:44.003 --> 23:09.943
some time i don't remember the exact date or 
whatnot that a rumor began to circulate around

22:44.003 --> 23:09.943
among people like bankers and other business 
leaders in town that there was a great invasion of

22:44.003 --> 23:09.943
blacks coming into oscar and that somehow that 
they were coming in from outside and they were

23:12.016 --> 23:21.028
getting ready to have this gigantic thing and that 
Austin now was going to be put into peril. And there

23:21.969 --> 23:29.159
were among that group people who wanted us to 
publish warnings to the public about this thing.

23:29.179 --> 23:39.272
Well, we were really loathe to do that kind of thing 
because What you're dealing with there is just

23:40.315 --> 23:48.606
applying a spark to the tinderbox. And so we wanted 
to be mighty sure before we did anything at all, and

23:50.087 --> 24:01.122
we were not about to publish warnings to people 
that the blacks are coming for crying out loud. And

24:02.123 --> 24:10.153
so we did mount an investigation, and we 
discovered that indeed there was an unusually

24:02.123 --> 24:10.153
large number of out-of-town black people in 
Austin. But we also discovered that they were all

24:11.230 --> 24:17.698
Baptists, and they were coming for a camp meeting 
that weekend. And so what we did was nothing. And we

24:22.284 --> 24:34.960
did nothing because to have done anything, even to 
have denied the river, very likely would have

24:22.284 --> 24:34.960
inflamed a situation that actually didn't exist, 
which we very easily could have created in

24:35.716 --> 25:04.187
cooperation with these rumors that were going 
around among responsible citizens of the town and

24:35.716 --> 25:04.187
so that's an instance in which we made a deliberate 
editorial judgment not to do something in order to

24:35.716 --> 25:04.187
avoid blowing the lid off

24:35.716 --> 25:04.187
so i don't know if that answers your question or not 
but that's certainly one illustration and also i

24:35.716 --> 25:04.187
think that illustrates the way in which we 
approached all those things. We had an acute

25:07.748 --> 25:23.470
sense, I think, during all that period of our 
responsibility

25:07.748 --> 25:23.470
not to be the catalyst that tore the town apart and 
whatnot. And we certainly tried. We didn't want to

25:28.116 --> 25:30.259
be in the business quote, news management. We 
didn't want to be in the business of providing

25:33.365 --> 25:40.384
cover-ups, but we also didn't want to be in the 
business of spreading the gas.
