00:02.495 --> 00:09.740
How did you learn how to study more and how to do the grades better?

00:09.760 --> 00:11.205
Who did you turn to for advice?

00:11.725 --> 00:13.949
Upperclassmen are always willing to help you out.

00:13.969 --> 00:17.956
I think everybody had sympathy for the classes that you had to take.

00:18.056 --> 00:20.140
Everybody had taken them and knew which ones were hard.

00:20.200 --> 00:24.749
And so people were pretty quick to help you say, you know, stay away from this teacher or go to that one.

00:24.789 --> 00:33.885
Or here's a good person who can help you in terms of, you know, picking up your math or figuring out how to do this engineering problem or whatever it is that you wanted to do.

00:33.865 --> 00:44.525
And as you look back, did you make, with the clarity of vision you have today, did you make any mistakes academically that first semester?

00:44.545 --> 00:46.529
Did you fail to do some things you should have done?

00:46.549 --> 00:50.035
No, I failed to study enough and I think everybody will tell you that.

00:50.015 --> 01:13.666
You're finally away from your family and away from your parents a little bit and there's always a tendency to want to go run around, even though I'll say that's more controlled for freshmen in the Corps than people who aren't, but there's still a lot of horseplay that goes on and there's still a lot of tempting times and want to stay back and play some of the games or whatever they've got going on in the dorms to get away from that.

01:13.706 --> 01:16.209
When I mean games, I mean just horsing around and horseplay.

01:16.990 --> 01:19.313
How did you communicate with your family?

01:19.647 --> 01:22.815
Did you write or was it email or telephone?

01:23.436 --> 01:33.981
No, my family didn't really, didn't really use much computer so we'd call over telephone and I've never really been good at writing letters so it was just easier to call and we usually try to do that.

01:34.061 --> 01:35.665
How often did you that first year?

01:36.725 --> 01:44.362
I think at first I started to call them probably maybe, you know, a couple times a week.

01:44.483 --> 01:49.334
That tapered off very quickly to once a week and once every two weeks.

01:49.354 --> 01:52.962
And then I'd get phone calls from them saying, where are you?

01:53.735 --> 01:56.521
But it kind of varied depending on what was going on.

01:56.582 --> 02:05.061
And I think the more comfortable I got from being here, the more comfortable I was to not necessarily have to call all the time and stay in touch all the time.

02:05.081 --> 02:09.010
That first semester, did you ever think about transferring, going somewhere else?

02:08.990 --> 02:10.552
No, I never thought about transferring.

02:10.572 --> 02:14.178
I didn't have any other place that I really thought that things would be different.

02:14.979 --> 02:27.658
And even though things I thought were difficult the first year just from the pressures of, I don't know, trying to do your freshman duties or whatever responsibilities that would be, I still knew too many friends to walk away from that.

02:27.758 --> 02:30.222
So I never considered transferring.

02:30.337 --> 02:37.528
And during that first semester, do you remember going to first time going to midnight Yale practice?

02:37.869 --> 02:38.230
I'm sure.

02:38.610 --> 02:39.211
What was it like?

02:39.772 --> 02:40.733
I think it was different.

02:40.754 --> 02:41.895
I'd never seen anything like that.

02:41.955 --> 02:44.019
I'd never been to a college football game before then.

02:44.039 --> 02:48.025
So I can't say that I really knew what to expect.

02:48.730 --> 02:57.144
don't think I've really appreciated a lot of that until later on when you start visiting other places and understanding other schools traditions, but no, it was different.

02:57.184 --> 03:06.840
It was fun and everybody was always excited and so much life was centered around football weekends that there was always a lot of activity going on and IEL was a part of it.

03:07.394 --> 03:14.745
Whatever, if there was a party at an upperclassman's house or a friend's house or something, it was usually before Midnight Yell, and you'd go over to Midnight Yell together.

03:14.805 --> 03:15.786
So it was fun.

03:15.867 --> 03:17.168
It was always something to look forward to.

03:17.188 --> 03:21.054
Now, in your years, Midnight Yell practice has always been in Kyle Field.

03:21.915 --> 03:23.598
It's always, yes, it's always been in Kyle Field.

03:23.638 --> 03:33.773
Because see, in earlier years, it was sometimes held on the MSC steps or out, oh, my brain's gone dead.

03:33.753 --> 03:38.441
the little area this side of the railroad that way from... You're talking about the Grove?

03:38.561 --> 03:38.922
The Grove.

03:39.203 --> 03:43.430
Now we have Yale practices Thursdays before the away games at the Grove.

03:43.650 --> 03:44.271
Okay.

03:44.292 --> 03:47.998
So we did have some Yale practices out the Grove.

03:48.164 --> 03:50.628
Now, what did you and your buddies do after midnight?

03:50.648 --> 03:52.371
Oh, it depends.

03:52.411 --> 04:06.173
Some of, sometimes we'd go home, and depending on what time the game was in the morning, some of us would go home, and some of us, especially the freshman year, it was the only time we got out of the dorm, so we didn't come back until we were forced to have to come back, and, you know, it was fun, so it just kind of varied.

04:07.154 --> 04:10.780
And what was your routine on a Saturday home game?

04:10.760 --> 04:13.444
Describe that day those were always busy busy.

04:13.464 --> 04:33.291
I mean there were if there were their outfit barbecues or Parents were coming in so there was always always mornings were spent cleaning up the dorms and cleaning up the the quad and cleaning up just different different things around the area and Sometimes you had the sometimes your outfit had the responsibility

04:33.271 --> 04:37.177
Having to leave early in the morning to go put up the flags in Kyle Field, so some of us would do that.

04:38.138 --> 04:39.521
Always had to hang.

04:40.102 --> 04:40.803
We kind of changed.

04:40.863 --> 04:51.499
At first we used to have outfit signs that we used to put, not outfit signs, but the kind of home football weekend banners that used to be out, we'd hang outside the dorms.

04:51.479 --> 05:01.632
But then I guess it got a little too rough, I guess, for some people's taste, and so they made us stop taking them down, and so then we had to start putting up the flags.

05:01.772 --> 05:07.799
I think the Commandant's Office bought, I'm not sure how large these flags are, but they hang from top to bottom of the dorm.

05:09.041 --> 05:13.386
Then we used to put those up, so it changed while I was there.

05:13.366 --> 05:24.945
Once we got done with that, there was, then it was time to get ready to do football weekend activities, core marching, and came back from marching, then went to the football game, and after that there was always things to do.

05:25.486 --> 05:27.889
How often did you have a date that first fall?

05:28.510 --> 05:31.475
Oh, I don't think I really had a date at all that fall, and that was okay.

05:32.016 --> 05:38.206
So a lot of times we just sat together with all our buddies from my freshman class, and that was fun.

05:38.787 --> 05:40.690
And after the game where?

05:41.345 --> 05:42.868
It kind of just depends.

05:42.908 --> 05:52.465
Sometimes there was always a couple of people who had brothers or sisters at A&M, and so we'd go to their house sometimes and cook some barbecue or do something like that.

05:53.326 --> 06:01.020
Other times we had two of our buddies, they were from College Station, so we'd go out there and parents would help cook stuff and we'd do that.

06:02.302 --> 06:05.648
And your first silver taps, what was that like?

06:06.522 --> 06:07.543
It was interesting.

06:08.084 --> 06:21.961
I can't say I'd ever seen anything like it before, and I don't think the first time I really went there I really knew what in the world was going on, because there's always a lot of people the first time, the first weekend you come back, and so I couldn't really see anything.

06:21.981 --> 06:24.064
You could hear it, but you couldn't necessarily see it.

06:25.145 --> 06:26.246
And I think it was neat.

06:26.266 --> 06:30.031
It was special to see that there was a tradition like that, and I think it was important.

06:30.051 --> 06:34.116
Did you get the impression that everybody that attended took it seriously?

06:34.805 --> 06:37.812
Oh yes, I've never seen anybody that hasn't taken it seriously.

06:38.163 --> 06:42.929
Sometimes people worry about the numbers declining at the end of the semester.

06:43.630 --> 06:45.031
I think some of that's understandable.

06:45.672 --> 06:50.498
I'm not sure if that's really a problem, but nobody's ever disrespected it necessarily.

06:50.518 --> 06:54.303
I think there was one time where there were people yelling some things at the dorm.

06:55.184 --> 07:00.510
That was only one time in five years that I can recall, so I can't really say that I ever think that was a problem.

07:01.251 --> 07:06.077
Have you ever had silver taps for someone you knew quite well?

07:06.631 --> 07:10.896
More recently than when I first came into A&M.

07:10.936 --> 07:14.721
And I think that's because you know more people leaving than you do when you come in.

07:14.922 --> 07:21.990
So that's certainly changed, but not starting off anyway.

07:22.051 --> 07:25.175
Let's see, core trip?

07:25.195 --> 07:26.456
Are there still core trips?

07:26.757 --> 07:27.457
Yes, there sure are.

07:28.158 --> 07:29.500
Where'd y'all go that first year?

07:29.868 --> 07:30.510
Oh, I don't know.

07:30.610 --> 07:32.175
I'm trying to remember where we went the first year.

07:32.476 --> 07:33.359
Austin?

07:33.379 --> 07:34.763
Well, I think the first year.

07:34.904 --> 07:35.285
Houston?

07:35.686 --> 07:38.595
First year we probably went to Austin.

07:39.672 --> 07:44.799
because we used to go to Baylor the following year and then Austin.

07:45.520 --> 07:47.622
So we'd flip-flop years, Austin and then Baylor.

07:48.564 --> 07:49.585
Sometimes it changed.

07:49.625 --> 07:57.335
I remember one year we played UNT or University of North Texas up in the Cowboy Stadium or Urban Stadium up in Dallas.

07:57.355 --> 08:02.382
So I remember one of our core trips was up there and then we had a parade in Fort Worth.

08:02.402 --> 08:03.423
So it's been different.

08:03.443 --> 08:04.284
We've never gone to Houston.

08:04.304 --> 08:05.646
We've never done one in Houston.

08:05.626 --> 08:11.872
But now that they've switched conferences on us, now we have both core trips in the same year and then none the next.

08:11.892 --> 08:14.215
So I think they're trying to figure out how to do that.

08:14.475 --> 08:15.796
I hadn't thought of that.

08:15.816 --> 08:19.840
Because now our closest home game or our closest away game is Texas Tech.

08:19.880 --> 08:21.242
And that's a long drive.

08:21.342 --> 08:23.684
So we haven't really figured out how to do that.

08:23.764 --> 08:26.567
And I know they're trying to work on that, but I'm not sure what will happen from here.

08:28.609 --> 08:31.752
Did you ever have, in any of your core trip,

08:31.732 --> 08:38.981
Did you ever have any negative experiences with someone in that town?

08:39.001 --> 08:45.288
Did anybody ever do anything that was inappropriate, trying to do anything to the Corps as it was marching?

08:45.469 --> 08:46.790
Most towns were pretty good about it.

08:46.830 --> 08:49.754
Most towns were really receptive and were very positive.

08:49.834 --> 08:53.959
I can't really recall that people were negative, except when you went to Austin.

08:53.939 --> 08:58.731
And then when you went to Austin, some people were either really good about it or really bad about it.

08:58.812 --> 09:00.857
So you just kind of took the good with the bad.

09:00.897 --> 09:04.807
And I think that really kind of heightens the rivalry.

09:04.867 --> 09:09.720
If you don't have any hard feelings before you go to Austin, you usually do when you leave.

09:10.055 --> 09:15.085
Let's see, first semester you said your grades weren't as high as you'd like.

09:15.445 --> 09:15.565
Right.

09:15.585 --> 09:16.647
But you passed everything.

09:16.888 --> 09:17.249
Oh, right.

09:17.269 --> 09:18.050
Didn't fail anything.

09:18.551 --> 09:18.671
Right.

09:18.691 --> 09:21.216
And political science was your major by then.

09:21.256 --> 09:26.967
And how did you feel at the end of that first semester?

09:27.419 --> 09:30.025
I was proud and glad that I'd done it through.

09:30.105 --> 09:33.533
And there was a, everybody talks a lot about the activities in the spring.

09:33.613 --> 09:39.647
So, you know, I think there was a lot to look forward to, although I wasn't ready to have a month off and then go back to the same routine again.

09:39.928 --> 09:43.195
What does a student do now with a month off?

09:43.215 --> 09:44.358
What did you do with that time?

09:44.859 --> 09:45.681
Oh, I don't know.

09:46.437 --> 09:51.163
I don't know, I've never really taken the full vacation, so I, you know, I'm not sure what everybody does.

09:51.203 --> 09:59.593
I know most people go home and just spend time with family, but, or some people get jobs, you know, they work over the holidays and help pay for some of their school.

10:00.454 --> 10:09.005
But most of the time I came back early to do activities with the Corps, so I never really spent an entire vacation, you know, at home.

10:09.366 --> 10:10.727
Most of it was coming back early.

10:10.747 --> 10:15.313
When did you first begin to get involved in what I'd call leadership activities?

10:16.610 --> 10:30.383
I guess probably not until late sophomore year and it was more involvement than leadership activities and that was doing some trying to be a counselor with fish camp.

10:31.124 --> 10:32.307
I was

10:32.287 --> 10:41.898
I was the guide on bear for K-1 my sophomore year, which I guess you could consider that a leadership position, but it's also really not because you're really not in charge of anything.

10:41.958 --> 10:49.166
It's really more you're really just kind of expected to do a little bit more, but it's not really necessarily leadership.

10:49.647 --> 10:58.497
Although there's a strong correlation I think a lot of times with people usually in those positions usually wind up doing something, but not necessarily.

10:58.797 --> 11:02.864
Yeah, when your freshman year is over, did you feel good as you look back on it, Phil?

11:02.944 --> 11:04.266
You were headed in the upper direction?

11:05.147 --> 11:07.491
Well, I don't know where I was really headed at the end of my freshman year.

11:07.551 --> 11:09.054
I really had no idea.

11:09.134 --> 11:15.404
I think that's a good year just because there's so much positive atmosphere surrounding that time period.

11:15.424 --> 11:19.230
I mean, it's just a really motivational time as a freshman.

11:19.270 --> 11:20.772
I don't know outside the Corps.

11:20.792 --> 11:22.375
I can't really tell you that.

11:22.355 --> 11:29.951
You know, inside you finish a hard year and, you know, you finish it off with Parents Weekend and Final Review and Muster and things like that.

11:30.011 --> 11:35.463
So it's really kind of a climatic time and I think the motivation's really high at that point.

11:35.483 --> 11:36.746
Did family come for Parents Weekend?

11:36.966 --> 11:39.331
Sure, sure.

11:39.351 --> 11:41.055
See, now 40 years ago that wouldn't have.

11:41.778 --> 11:44.323
That wouldn't have happened with many people.

11:44.644 --> 11:48.371
Then that summer, what did you do into your freshman year?

11:49.072 --> 11:53.581
I went to do an internship in New York, so I, that's what I did.

11:53.601 --> 11:54.322
How did you land that?

11:54.904 --> 11:59.813
My family, well, my mom's side of the family is originally from New York, so I went to go work for a congresswoman up there.

12:00.575 --> 12:02.318
Was that a good experience?

12:02.298 --> 12:03.599
No, I think it was a great experience.

12:03.619 --> 12:04.000
I enjoyed it.

12:04.020 --> 12:08.204
I mean, I miss being here in Texas, but it was a good experience.

12:08.224 --> 12:08.985
Okay.

12:09.045 --> 12:10.427
You come back as a sophomore.

12:10.467 --> 12:13.590
How is being a sophomore different from being a freshman?

12:13.890 --> 12:14.491
Oh, I don't know.

12:14.591 --> 12:17.554
I thought it was a lot different until I got there and realized it's really not that much.

12:17.574 --> 12:19.056
You're pretty much a glorified freshman.

12:20.537 --> 12:27.205
Well, but it's different in the fact that, you know, you do have to be more responsible and you do have to, you know, help teach people.

12:27.385 --> 12:30.448
On the other end, you're kind of just on the receiving end.

12:30.428 --> 12:33.030
But it's a challenge.

12:33.571 --> 12:41.959
You have to learn to do a little bit more, and it's tough learning to teach people how to do things versus teaching one person yourself, so it's more complicated.

12:41.979 --> 12:46.443
Did you have any favorite things you did with the fish in your outfit?

12:47.124 --> 12:50.627
Oh, you know, most of the time it was pretty typical.

12:51.067 --> 12:53.069
I don't think I did anything outside the ordinary.

12:53.109 --> 12:59.035
There were every now and then there were, but I think we had one.

12:59.183 --> 13:14.540
One thing, I can't say it was necessarily legal, but I used to have a deck of cards, and since there were four different suits, I used to have four different exercises, and we'd go through with the number of repetitions they had on the number of the card you pulled up, and you keep going through that until you finish the deck.

13:14.560 --> 13:20.186
There weren't any breaks, and jokers were wild, so jokers were a class set of whatever their favorite choice was.

13:20.926 --> 13:24.330
Was there more time for study as a sophomore?

13:25.424 --> 13:32.140
I think there was probably more time for studying, but you also usually goofed off a lot more than you did as a freshman, too, so it equaled out.

13:33.443 --> 13:40.499
And by that time, where did you, where were you and your buddies going for a good time on a Friday night or a Saturday night?

13:40.519 --> 13:43.045
I think probably on the weekends.

13:43.447 --> 13:49.596
Spent a lot more time either going to, I think we went to a few of the local bars or whatever.

13:49.877 --> 13:53.883
Went up to Northgate a little bit more, the Dixie Chicken and the places like that.

13:54.604 --> 13:58.630
Usually new friends that you could go over, they were having something at their house.

13:58.670 --> 14:00.713
We spent a lot more time doing that because you knew more people.

14:01.334 --> 14:03.277
We knew a little bit more activities going on campus.

14:05.240 --> 14:10.888
So whereas freshmen here, I think most of the time we usually maybe found one place that we would go and that would be it.

14:10.936 --> 14:14.494
I asked this out of naivety.

14:14.614 --> 14:18.634
What are the wildest places in Bryan College Station that Aggies may visit?

14:19.812 --> 14:25.139
You know, that's a good question because I don't really know if there's a lot of wild places.

14:25.219 --> 14:29.865
I mean, I guess in some ways this is a really conservative town, in some ways it isn't.

14:32.308 --> 14:34.952
But really, I really can't think.

14:35.853 --> 14:42.541
There's a bar in Northgate in the corner next to the Hollicks, and it's changed names about five different times.

14:42.902 --> 14:46.927
And that's been about the trendiest place, and it's never picked up.

14:47.428 --> 14:49.330
That's why it keeps changing names every time.

14:49.681 --> 14:51.810
And so I think that would probably be the weirdest one.

14:52.195 --> 14:57.801
Probably a little bit more typical of a place you'd find in a big city, although certainly not the quality.

15:00.124 --> 15:03.067
I think Barracuda Bar maybe, that's changed.

15:03.388 --> 15:10.576
It's definitely different, but I find most people would rather just go and have something at their house, rather throw some sort of activity at their house.

15:10.596 --> 15:20.447
Now, Aggies don't go to those bars way up at Highway 21 and Texas Avenue in North Bryan, do they, where the truckers go?

15:21.305 --> 15:23.507
No, not really.

15:23.527 --> 15:28.491
Most people, I think most people can find themselves to kind of this area.

15:28.571 --> 15:33.155
I guess there are a few places, but they're really, I can't say most people usually go to them in Bryan.

15:33.856 --> 15:36.919
I guess there's two places in Bryan that some people go to.

15:39.381 --> 15:45.626
One's called the Blarney Stone, and the other is the Tap, or not the Tap, the other is Kearney's.

15:46.787 --> 15:50.991
But I think that's the only two places that people tend to really go to in Bryan.

15:51.410 --> 15:59.382
When did you become aware of the MSC's variety of activity organizations?

15:59.402 --> 16:02.086
Probably not until a lot later because that's never where I was really involved.

16:02.706 --> 16:06.091
I knew that they had a lot going on there, but I couldn't really tell you what.

16:09.016 --> 16:14.584
I can't say it was really until probably later in my college career that I really, really fully understood what was going on in the MSC.

16:15.705 --> 16:20.252
As, by the time you're, say, a sophomore to junior,

16:20.418 --> 16:23.250
Describe the A&M student body in general.

16:23.350 --> 16:25.981
What was their basic attitude, liberal, conservative?

16:26.021 --> 16:27.045
Where were they from?

16:27.085 --> 16:30.158
Describe typical Aggies.

16:31.943 --> 16:36.231
I think most people regionally are from the Houston or Dallas area.

16:36.251 --> 16:40.279
I mean, most people tend to come from those places.

16:40.359 --> 16:43.425
If you were to ask what school they went to, it would be somewhere in that area.

16:45.268 --> 16:55.167
That doesn't mean that people weren't from other locations, but typically, I mean, I don't think I'd be going out on a limb at saying probably half our student body is from one of those two towns.

16:55.147 --> 16:58.832
So I think you tend to find a lot more conservativeness in the students.

16:58.852 --> 17:10.708
I mean, you know, you can sit here being at the school, you might say there's obviously extremes at both ends, but if you were to take our campus and compare it to other campuses, I'd say it was probably much more conservative on the whole.

17:11.890 --> 17:17.998
And by and large, are they from working class, middle class, upper class family backgrounds?

17:18.873 --> 17:20.616
I think it's varied.

17:21.298 --> 17:28.692
You know, there are certainly people who come from very well families, and certainly that's not a surprise.

17:28.833 --> 17:32.620
But, you know, I think a lot of people are middle class.

17:33.442 --> 17:36.207
I think they probably fall in that middle class category.

17:36.187 --> 17:39.470
But I can't say it's unusual to find somebody who's putting themselves through school either.

17:40.331 --> 17:42.994
And it's not looked down upon or anything like that either.

17:43.014 --> 17:50.141
So, you know, it's a mixed bag, but I think most people probably fit in that middle category versus the other two ends.

17:50.822 --> 18:01.553
And are people of different religious, national, ethnic backgrounds, were they accepted as far as you know?

18:01.803 --> 18:15.010
Well, I think so, but this is also, I think, a time where people are really, well, I shouldn't say this is a time where they're really pushing diversity issues, because it's been something they've been pushing in different forms or different aspects for a long time.

18:16.694 --> 18:19.339
But they're just continuing that.

18:19.319 --> 18:24.886
I think it's a lot better, but I guess there are some people that still think it's not.

18:25.026 --> 18:29.011
It still needs to be improved and still needs to be built upon.

18:29.952 --> 18:33.236
So there's work to do that, and it's different.

18:33.917 --> 18:44.069
I think you find grad students are well into the majority or Asian in descent, well over 50%.

18:44.309 --> 18:47.453
I think it's probably somewhere in 85-90% range.

18:47.433 --> 18:58.099
And then when you get the undergraduate level, it's, you know, it's still predominantly, I think, white, but Texas is also becoming majority Hispanic, so there's a lot more Hispanic.

18:59.302 --> 19:00.184
So it's mixed.

19:00.204 --> 19:03.231
And in the Corps, everybody's accepted, aren't they?

19:03.211 --> 19:04.753
I never thought about it.

19:05.334 --> 19:11.622
I think I've dealt with more of that this last year than I've dealt with diversity issues while I was in the Corps.

19:11.962 --> 19:15.607
We never judge anybody really on color or anything like that.

19:15.667 --> 19:17.249
It was really more physical ability.

19:17.770 --> 19:21.815
So I don't really ever recall getting into a discussion about that while in the Corps.

19:22.456 --> 19:23.838
I just never really noticed that.

19:23.858 --> 19:27.042
I think even though integration's been around for

19:27.022 --> 19:34.508
I guess almost 30 years at this point in the Corps, that's more of an issue than diversity.

19:35.489 --> 19:41.695
Women being in male outfits is more of an issue than what nationality or race you're from.

19:41.835 --> 19:47.320
There never, on the first day with the Corps, there was never any problem over race.

19:47.980 --> 19:48.961
Never, never.

19:50.062 --> 19:55.307
Fred McClure, he got 92% of the vote when he ran for student body president.

19:55.327 --> 19:57.028
And the fact he was black, so?

19:57.008 --> 19:59.953
And that's the way I've seen it.

20:00.234 --> 20:08.308
That's why I think it was strange that it's been a big adjustment for me this year being outside the Corps, dealing with that a lot more than it was inside.

20:08.368 --> 20:20.350
In your era, do you think the Corps as a group is more inclusive than the non-Corps students?

20:20.482 --> 20:22.044
I think as a group, yes.

20:22.064 --> 20:28.473
I mean, there's discussions about how, you know, inclusive is the core to other organizations.

20:29.014 --> 20:30.616
And I don't know the answer to that, really.

20:30.676 --> 20:34.141
But if you're in the core, I think the core is pretty inclusive.

20:35.283 --> 20:37.365
And what about religious affiliation?

20:37.966 --> 20:39.308
Jewish, Catholic, Protestant?

20:39.508 --> 20:40.710
I get into the same thing.

20:41.091 --> 20:42.793
Once again, I can't really ever...

20:42.773 --> 20:45.577
ever really remember getting into that.

20:45.918 --> 20:52.308
Now, being that this is a little bit more of a Christian kind of atmosphere down here, you do see a lot of it.

20:52.348 --> 20:56.014
I know it's pretty heavily Baptist, so you see a lot more of that.

20:57.236 --> 21:05.148
I guess if you had to put race versus religion, I think you would see a lot more of the religion than you would the race by far.

21:06.110 --> 21:08.173
But even then, I can't say that I've

21:08.153 --> 21:10.236
That's ever really been a thing.

21:10.276 --> 21:21.449
If anything, Sundays were, you know, if you were going to church, sometimes people would go together to church on Sundays, but if you weren't Christian, I can't ever recall anybody ever thinking about that.

21:21.469 --> 21:25.714
Did you, in your first years here, did you attend some worship activities here?

21:26.155 --> 21:28.397
Yeah, a lot of us went to church together.

21:28.437 --> 21:29.919
I'm Catholic, but I go to St.

21:29.939 --> 21:31.681
Mary's, and a lot of us went to St.

21:31.701 --> 21:32.182
Mary's.

21:32.202 --> 21:35.226
And were students welcomed warmly at St.

21:35.246 --> 21:35.646
Mary's?

21:35.879 --> 21:36.900
Oh, yes, very much so.

21:36.920 --> 21:42.848
I mean, the church was very much majority students, so a lot of things were centered around that.

21:43.128 --> 21:44.890
So, no, it was very exciting.

21:44.910 --> 21:53.000
And in the Corps or anywhere else on the student on this campus, the fact you were Catholic, was that ever a plus or a minus?

21:53.781 --> 21:58.387
No, I don't think it was really, I don't think anybody ever really made a concern about it.

21:58.567 --> 22:02.472
I mean, you went together with the people that obviously went to church with you.

22:02.492 --> 22:05.616
In your Corps outfit, was there religious variety?

22:06.001 --> 22:06.502
Oh, yes.

22:06.522 --> 22:07.724
There was definitely a religious variety.

22:08.545 --> 22:14.935
And not just different denominations, you know, being Baptist or Methodist or Catholic or anything like that.

22:14.995 --> 22:18.881
I mean, there were Jewish and Hindu and different things like that.

22:18.921 --> 22:21.045
So, no, I think it was never an issue.

22:22.026 --> 22:26.473
Now, no longer do Corps members have nicknames.

22:26.656 --> 22:28.258
Well, yes and no.

22:28.358 --> 22:29.100
Some people don't.

22:30.522 --> 22:31.924
I guess it depends on the outfits you're in.

22:31.984 --> 22:34.788
Some outfits tend to pride themselves on that a little bit more.

22:35.629 --> 22:39.455
Not as nothing to the degree that it used to be, that's for sure.

22:39.635 --> 22:41.918
But nicknames, I can't say, are uncommon, though, either.

22:42.359 --> 22:52.714
See, 50 years ago, it was common to give somebody a nickname by something that was distinctive about them so that the Jewish students would sometimes be nicknamed Jew Boy.

22:52.694 --> 22:54.297
But it was not a put down.

22:54.638 --> 22:55.881
It was an identifier.

22:56.462 --> 23:01.894
Like another one was fats or somebody else was red or rusty.

23:01.914 --> 23:04.459
But somebody today reading that

23:04.810 --> 23:07.496
might think that it was a put down, but it wasn't.

23:07.516 --> 23:11.085
Well, there are nicknames that still, like I said, some people sign nicknames today.

23:11.145 --> 23:14.934
And I'm not going to say that, I mean, a lot of them are still similar.

23:15.054 --> 23:19.645
I mean, we used to have, I think we used to have one of our guys, his name was Boog.

23:19.685 --> 23:23.173
I'm not really sure exactly how that really came about.

23:23.153 --> 23:26.897
Another guy, we had another guy whose name was Fatty.

23:27.497 --> 23:33.043
But we never, but once again, I don't think it was ever, it was more, I don't know.

23:33.463 --> 23:35.365
Some of these things just stuck and I never thought about it.

23:36.386 --> 23:51.000
Among the people that you knew best in the Corps or anybody else, what do you think, in general, was their opinion about women being members of the Corps today?

23:50.980 --> 23:53.904
Well, it depends on what outfits you talk to.

23:53.924 --> 23:56.568
The ones that are integrated tend to be okay with it.

23:56.588 --> 23:58.590
When I say integrated, I mean really fully integrated.

23:58.650 --> 24:04.218
If you're talking about an outfit that's got one or two females in it, it usually tends to still be a lot of frustration there.

24:04.939 --> 24:13.731
But if they're an outfit that's really typically had a lot of women, the band has had a lot of women, they don't think it's not really an issue over there very much.

24:13.711 --> 24:16.558
But then if you get to the ones that are all male, it's very much an issue.

24:17.300 --> 24:19.345
So it kind of just, it varies.

24:19.365 --> 24:20.287
It depends on who you're talking to.

24:20.548 --> 24:29.610
If you were advising the leaders of the Corps, what would be the minimum percentage you think an outfit ought to have as female?

24:30.603 --> 24:35.956
That's a good question because we've struggled to find that answer out, and I don't know if I have it.

24:36.257 --> 24:40.167
I don't think just having three or four or something like that's the right answer.

24:40.227 --> 24:41.270
If you're going to do it, do it right.

24:42.052 --> 24:44.297
And I can't say I'm against integration either.

24:45.340 --> 24:47.886
It's just one of those things that I think that

24:47.866 --> 24:54.632
If you're really going to be effective, I mean, you really need enough to guarantee that they'll be in some leadership positions.

24:54.652 --> 24:58.456
You need enough to guarantee that they're at least representative in each class.

24:59.176 --> 25:01.578
So, and those things are tough to come by.

25:01.638 --> 25:04.681
I think it's in the band where it's a lot more common.

25:04.701 --> 25:09.345
I mean, I think almost half the females are in the band that exist in the core.

25:09.926 --> 25:13.729
So, you know, is it as big of a deal in the band?

25:13.829 --> 25:17.873
No, but percentages change once you get outside the band.

25:17.853 --> 25:22.743
And are there many black women, have there been many black women in the Corps?

25:23.444 --> 25:24.026
No, not many.

25:24.447 --> 25:29.838
I mean there's been a few, but I'd say probably a much smaller percentage.

25:30.479 --> 25:32.503
What about international members?

25:32.939 --> 25:34.943
Well, there's been quite a few international members.

25:35.003 --> 25:37.989
I mean, sometimes it's tough to tell that.

25:38.290 --> 25:42.317
I mean, you can't just look down and know whether somebody's from a different country or not.

25:42.879 --> 25:47.067
But certainly we come across, you know, my fair share of different people from different countries.

25:49.812 --> 25:51.235
Let's see.

25:51.215 --> 25:55.481
We were talking about religion a while ago.

25:55.962 --> 25:57.925
You went to worship service at St.

25:57.945 --> 25:58.326
Mary's.

25:58.927 --> 26:03.754
Were there any religious organizations on campus that you were a part of ever?

26:04.555 --> 26:06.057
No, I can't say I really went anything.

26:06.077 --> 26:11.265
I mean, there is a breakaway on campus where they, it's not denominational, I guess.

26:11.768 --> 26:16.172
I don't know if there's a particular denomination that kind of hosts that and funds that.

26:16.892 --> 26:19.034
But sometimes I go to that.

26:19.575 --> 26:21.196
And that was, it started off campus.

26:21.256 --> 26:23.378
It started at Central Baptist and Bryan.

26:24.179 --> 26:27.321
And it's since grown pretty large that it's on campus.

26:28.042 --> 26:29.904
But I haven't gone to that recently.

26:30.084 --> 26:31.505
Went to it a few times when it was smaller.

26:31.905 --> 26:35.268
But now it's a little too big for me to really want to go.

26:35.368 --> 26:37.150
And two, I've gotten busier as I've gotten older too.

26:37.170 --> 26:41.033
Did you feel comfortable as a Catholic attending those services?

26:41.013 --> 26:42.095
Oh yeah, that wasn't a problem.

26:42.135 --> 26:45.361
But then I think almost every church has some sort of student organization on campus.

26:45.922 --> 26:47.485
So if you wanted to be active in that, you could.

26:49.109 --> 27:00.270
As you, in those first couple of years, what did you see as the most respected or admired student leader positions?

27:01.600 --> 27:02.201
Well, I don't know.

27:02.242 --> 27:03.224
That's a good question.

27:03.625 --> 27:10.081
I've seen it when I wasn't in some of those and I've seen it when I am in some of those and I don't know the answer to the question either way.

27:11.023 --> 27:15.795
The grass is always greener on the other side, so I don't really know.

27:16.518 --> 27:24.850
I think everybody always respects the Yale leaders just because the other thing is they're not really in a position to have to make a decision.

27:24.890 --> 27:26.372
They just get to have fun.

27:26.432 --> 27:27.934
That's really the bottom line.

27:27.954 --> 27:30.778
They get to enjoy themselves and have a good time with it.

27:30.798 --> 27:34.623
In a lot of ways, I think that's probably the most idealized one.

27:35.224 --> 27:38.529
You get to be a center of attention and not really that much responsibility.

27:38.629 --> 27:43.656
There's a lot of work to it, but the responsibility level isn't necessarily as high.

27:43.636 --> 27:47.542
So I think that's one that people tend to really, really want to be a part of.

27:48.643 --> 27:51.347
And then it changes from there.

27:51.367 --> 27:52.469
Then it gets more, a lot more.

27:53.010 --> 27:56.234
I mean, you can talk about student body president, but I don't know.

27:56.274 --> 27:58.758
That's varied.

27:59.299 --> 28:05.267
I mean, there's a lot of people that are voting, but I guess it's tough for me to be objective about that being in that role.

28:05.388 --> 28:08.412
That's tough for me to really evaluate that.

28:08.392 --> 28:23.346
But then when you start getting into the MSC or the Corps of Cadets or in the Greek life or something like that, you know, clearly they're obviously those top positions in those organizations are always aspired to be because it's much more centered around that organization.

28:23.495 --> 28:29.222
Now, how active were the Greek organizations in recruiting freshman year?

28:30.003 --> 28:31.465
Oh, they've been increasing every year.

28:31.485 --> 28:35.390
I can't say they've really been very active.

28:35.510 --> 28:41.077
When I came in here in 96, I mean, I think all Greek organizations total were about the size of the Corps.

28:41.117 --> 28:46.043
And they're not, they have not been very organized.

28:46.103 --> 28:51.510
So it's really kind of, for lack of a better term, loose confederacy out there.

28:51.490 --> 28:56.756
And since I've been here, they've certainly gotten a lot more organized and are starting to do a lot more activities.

28:57.397 --> 29:12.836
And I think that some of that is reflective of the fact that we're getting ready to, not yet, but getting ready to get into a second generation, possibly some Greek, you know, where their sons and daughters could have been in a fraternity or sorority here.

29:13.317 --> 29:15.980
And we're not quite at that point, but you're starting to see us getting closer to that.

29:16.020 --> 29:17.902
So I think that's probably reflective of that.

29:19.064 --> 29:21.126
Did you ever think about joining?

29:21.342 --> 29:23.386
No, that's not really what I want to do.

29:23.426 --> 29:26.653
I think the Corps is very much a fraternity.

29:26.873 --> 29:30.280
Even though it's a military organization, it's still very, very fraternal.

29:30.962 --> 29:32.946
And to me, that was good for me.

29:33.326 --> 29:34.609
Trivia information for you.

29:34.649 --> 29:40.160
We have a higher percentage per capita of fraternity and sorority members than UT does.

29:40.902 --> 29:41.022
Right.

29:41.002 --> 29:45.590
At Austin, 5% of the male undergraduate, 6% of the female.

29:46.011 --> 29:47.593
Here it's 6 and 14.

29:48.915 --> 29:52.542
More than twice as many of our women are in sororities as there.

29:53.844 --> 29:55.647
Well, that doesn't surprise me though either.

29:56.729 --> 29:59.213
Did you ever hear of any secret fraternities here?

30:00.037 --> 30:04.524
Well, there's rumors, but I can't say that I really know much about it.

30:04.644 --> 30:06.307
And I don't know.

30:06.347 --> 30:11.715
There's so many organizations now at this point that it's hard to really keep up with what's rumor, what's fact.

30:11.755 --> 30:12.196
I don't know.

30:13.859 --> 30:15.902
When did you get involved with student government?

30:17.418 --> 30:19.120
Not until junior year.

30:19.921 --> 30:21.804
The muster committee was a part of student government.

30:21.884 --> 30:24.427
I think it's always been a part of student government.

30:24.467 --> 30:33.179
Well, I say that cautiously, but still I think it's been organized under that umbrella since the late 70s.

30:34.180 --> 30:37.865
And so I got involved in that committee and was a part of that.

30:38.265 --> 30:39.567
This is to plan the campus muster.

30:39.587 --> 30:40.068
That's correct.

30:40.969 --> 30:43.392
But other than that, I haven't really done much with student government.

30:43.928 --> 30:47.920
Other than that, that was when I first got involved.

30:48.281 --> 30:52.593
How do you go from there to what you've just retired from?

30:52.613 --> 30:53.917
Well, that's a good question.

30:53.957 --> 30:56.284
That's not the first time I've had that asked.

30:57.412 --> 31:03.122
There's a lot more to do in this job than necessarily understanding all the dynamic aspects of student government.

31:03.523 --> 31:11.937
And I'll be honest with you, when you look at the typical student body presence, I can't, at least in the last decade, I know that's certainly changed over the years.

31:13.820 --> 31:15.523
But they come from a lot of different places.

31:16.685 --> 31:18.188
The one before me was from the MSB.
