WEBVTT

00:01.162 --> 00:02.383
Southwest. We beat everybody else. There were 
dozens and dozens of cities that applied for

00:03.705 --> 00:09.171
those, but they didn't have the process we had in 
place. They didn't have the action program. They

00:11.333 --> 00:24.687
didn't have the implementation capability that 
this grant, this grant was probably the purest

00:11.333 --> 00:24.687
planning grant I ever saw in my life that was 
oriented toward away from politics and toward a

00:11.333 --> 00:24.687
doing philosophy. They came back to us, this 
apartment of whatever it was at that time, the

00:27.858 --> 00:31.763
interiors, it was getting folded into something 
else. They came back and they asked if they could

00:32.103 --> 00:40.835
use, copy our plan and our program to distribute to 
other cities to show them how they wanted it to be

00:32.103 --> 00:40.835
done. In essence, it was the model for parking open 
space planning in the Southwest. That reminds me

00:45.341 --> 00:50.948
of what happened many years before in California 
when I was with ABAC. We had our regional planning

00:52.968 --> 00:59.599
process in place at the time that the Title VII open 
space land grants came into being. And we applied

01:00.280 --> 01:01.302
for them. Our member cities and our counties 
applied for them because we had the process in

01:01.322 --> 01:06.390
place. In one calendar year, I was told many years 
later by an employee of Interior Bureau of Outdoor

01:07.352 --> 01:16.647
Recreation that we got over half of all the funds 
available in the United States in that one count a

01:16.880 --> 01:23.006
year through ABAC. That's great. And they didn't 
want people to know that, of course. But there you

01:26.650 --> 01:27.091
go. Well, see, we ought to do a better job of letting 
that be known, of these victories. We always think

01:32.496 --> 01:34.418
these grants are political. And they have emerged 
more and more so, it seems like. But there are times

01:37.521 --> 01:41.446
when these windows open up and there's true 
competition. And the communities that are doing

01:41.526 --> 01:45.790
the planning really reap the benefits from the 
wars. I'm trying to get a regional plan process

01:46.850 --> 01:56.766
going in the Brazos Valley now, and I'm having some 
problems, of course, because, oh yeah, it's a

01:46.850 --> 01:56.766
tough thing. But if they get it, and then some of 
these programs do come along, they'll have

01:57.607 --> 02:04.157
something in place and they can move on it 
immediately.

02:06.801 --> 02:09.145
However, now back to Fort Worth. What do you find 
you're doing in Fort Worth that might be different

02:10.930 --> 02:19.996
than what you did in Corpus Christi, Galveston, 
Beaumont, Arlington? Well, it's completely

02:21.320 --> 02:22.543
different. in the sense that an awful lot of the 
planning has already been done. And now what they

02:26.369 --> 02:39.611
really need to do is update it, precise it, put it 
into an implementation mode, and then package it

02:26.369 --> 02:39.611
all up into something called a growth management 
performance system where everybody understands

02:26.369 --> 02:39.611
it. I'm much more involved in the implementation 
making something happen than I am in the planning

02:44.309 --> 02:48.154
to make it happen. You know, we've had a cultural 
district since 1918, 1936, and we're now in the

02:48.935 --> 02:56.544
process of trying to make something more happen. 
It's evolved naturally down here. It's quite

02:58.206 --> 03:02.571
prestigious, but now we can really use it as a 
catalyst to do something else. So it's more into

03:02.591 --> 03:04.654
action planning. We're doing action planning 
here. What do you mean by action planning? Well,

03:10.668 --> 03:35.562
more of taking what we've got and saying okay if 
this is where we want to be five or ten or twenty

03:10.668 --> 03:35.562
years from now what do we do next year to get there 
what are the steps we take tomorrow next week next

03:10.668 --> 03:35.562
month what are some specific things more of a betty 
crocker cookbook kind of thing you know break the

03:10.668 --> 03:35.562
egg then do this do that we're more into into the 
action planning short-term cost strategic

03:10.668 --> 03:35.562
planning if you want this It's just precising 
down, dealing with smaller, more manageable

03:35.997 --> 03:46.633
issues and concerns within the context that's 
provided by the overall planning that's gone

03:35.997 --> 03:46.633
before this.

03:49.718 --> 03:50.238
Your views. 99.999%, which I buy 100%. So anyway, 
what you're talking about in terms of your action

03:56.248 --> 04:01.195
plans, really you're talking about the short 
range rather than the mid-range or the long range.

04:07.475 --> 04:09.042
Yeah, we're putting more emphasis on generating 
short-term and repackaging the mid-range and the

04:09.190 --> 04:15.216
long-term. Repackaging them where they kind of 
have a fresh look about them and then using that

04:15.256 --> 04:36.936
repackaging process to identify these specific 
actionable items that we can deal with in the

04:15.256 --> 04:36.936
short-term to make planning seem more useful, 
more current, more important to people in the

04:15.256 --> 04:36.936
decision-making areas. Now, are you going to be 
able to achieve annual review of the

04:37.186 --> 04:44.874
comprehensive plan here in Fort Worth like you 
have elsewhere? I would be stunned if we couldn't,

04:45.295 --> 04:53.924
in particular because it's going to be seen as part 
of a system as opposed to a product. When you

04:54.205 --> 04:59.431
produce a planning product, there's still that 
tendency that you've finished it. If you indicate

04:59.451 --> 05:07.159
that it's part of a system and get away from the 
process and say, no, it's a system here, People, I

05:07.493 --> 05:09.916
think, understand what systems like that clock. 
The clock is always moving. The clock is always

05:10.937 --> 05:12.519
turning. And I think it's going to be very easy for 
us in a growth management system to insert these

05:12.539 --> 05:24.654
modules each year as we update these things and as 
we pull out these new issues and give them some

05:12.539 --> 05:24.654
prominence in the annual work program. Yeah, if a 
comprehensive plan document is viewed as sort of a

05:24.874 --> 05:36.268
periodic pulling together and documentation of 
your goals, objectives, and policies, and so

05:24.874 --> 05:36.268
forth, as a part of an ongoing process, and it's 
going to have to be done periodically, then I think

05:36.721 --> 05:43.609
you've got it made. And you know, one thing we were 
trying to do in Arlington that was completely

05:44.011 --> 05:54.685
different than anywhere else, we were trying to 
use the new technologies, the computer age here,

05:44.011 --> 05:54.685
the microcomputers, for the plan. We wanted the 
plan, the product that's called the plan, to be on

05:54.745 --> 05:59.491
the computer. We wanted to have it accessible to 
everybody in their home. We wanted the developer

06:02.816 --> 06:10.305
to be able to pick up his telephone, plug in his 
machine, and look at the plan, the goals, the

06:02.816 --> 06:10.305
objectives. We wanted to be able to update that 
plan daily with new statistics, New objectives,

06:13.930 --> 06:16.954
new council policies from that week. Type the 
thing in there. Don't worry about the latter time

06:17.875 --> 06:19.878
of the printing. Bang! At the end of the week, it's 
in the machine. You can find out what those cities,

06:22.361 --> 06:29.250
what the city's goals and objectives and policies 
and proposals are right there. Updated daily, if

06:29.270 --> 06:31.293
not weekly. And Ray is still working on that. I'm 
not convinced that Arlington won't have the first

06:36.003 --> 06:44.913
state-of-the-art comprehensive plan because 
he's got the knowledge and the technology to make

06:36.003 --> 06:44.913
this jump. We have done a poor, pathetic job of 
using the computers in the planning profession.

06:50.800 --> 06:53.824
We still got some people that can use them for 
various little elements or something. It's like

06:53.844 --> 06:55.926
someone telling me, well, now I use my calculator. 
Hey, the real value of that thing for keeping the

06:58.970 --> 07:03.356
plants current has not been touched upon in any of 
the literature I've seen. And that's what

07:03.376 --> 07:05.179
Arlington can do. That's what we were committed to 
doing over there. We're going to take a long time

07:07.502 --> 07:14.271
doing it, and I sure as heck was going to do a 
state-of-the-art one that was going to be

07:07.502 --> 07:14.271
technologically superior to anybody else. What 
do you want to know about the staff? Yeah, what

07:16.875 --> 07:20.660
about the current planning staff? Are you up to 
speed in terms of strength and technical

07:20.800 --> 07:26.007
capability and so forth? We're way understaffed 
for a city of this size. We do not have the technical

07:31.280 --> 07:38.209
capabilities that a city of this size ought to 
have.

07:42.515 --> 07:50.847
We have a very, in terms of overall capability, the 
department's very average.

07:51.788 --> 07:55.632
In fact, I'm kind of surprised by the amount of the 
averageness. There's a big average, big group in

07:55.652 --> 07:58.255
the middle average. There's a couple way below 
average. There's a couple way above average. And I

08:04.482 --> 08:07.486
would have thought the skewing would have been a 
little different. That's something I'm

08:07.566 --> 08:08.367
learning. This is the first time I've been in, 
somebody might say it's a large city. I'm kind of

08:12.091 --> 08:14.674
surprised that there's not a bigger grouping 
above average. There's just a big mass of average.

08:20.565 --> 08:23.371
We could use more, but effectiveness doesn't 
depend. This is out of my book here. Effectiveness

08:25.074 --> 08:27.199
doesn't depend on the size of the staff you have. It 
depends on making sure you're doing the right

08:27.659 --> 08:31.988
things with the staff that you have. and it means 
changing priorities, it means giving up some

08:31.968 --> 08:51.495
things we were doing that were taking a lot of time, 
giving up some things we were doing that weren't

08:31.968 --> 08:51.495
taking a lot of time, but just getting rid of them so 
that you can concentrate your resources and your

08:31.968 --> 08:51.495
energies in the areas where you ought to be, in the 
most protected areas, in the areas with the

08:31.968 --> 08:51.495
biggest visibility, visibility, and in the area 
where we can be quote, most effective, unquote.

08:57.243 --> 08:59.807
You've got to put your resources where you can be 
effective. You can't be everything to everybody.

09:02.671 --> 09:05.695
In this department, the truth is spread out too 
thin. One of the things I've been trying to do is get

09:05.715 --> 09:09.260
us out of certain businesses. We've also been 
trying to do more co-producing. an old throwback

09:13.767 --> 09:35.776
to the self-help days of planning, where you use 
our technical expertise to advise some citizens

09:13.767 --> 09:35.776
who are informed and educated who didn't do a lot of 
the work themselves, allowing us to serve in

09:13.767 --> 09:35.776
almost a consultant role, except allowing us also 
to take credit for what comes out of this effort and

09:13.767 --> 09:35.776
put our name on it, our stamp on it. Yes, I wanted to 
ask you what the relationship of the department

09:35.796 --> 09:42.745
was now to its citizen base in the community. We 
have lost a lot of that citizen base. They bring it

09:47.798 --> 09:49.261
up when they need it. It's almost like when we 
recycled the sector plan, we went back out and

09:49.281 --> 09:53.891
resurrected the sector councils. Those councils 
have now been neglected and allowed to decay. We

09:58.435 --> 10:01.420
don't provide staff support to most of them. The 
newsletters are dropping off now. There's

10:05.207 --> 10:09.495
techniques we can do to maintain those contacts 
and to maintain those groups. It's hard for them to

10:09.515 --> 10:11.980
sustain without issues. So we have frittered 
away. Frittered? Frittered away. a valuable

10:18.517 --> 10:20.802
resource base out there. Well, do you mean to 
reactivate that? My desire is, but I have to do it as

10:24.429 --> 10:34.990
part of the strategy here, that this was a 
conscious decision on the part of the prior city

10:24.429 --> 10:34.990
manager and the council to to allow these 
institutions to decay, this kind of benign

10:35.982 --> 10:41.850
neglect. Oh, no, we're all for it. But if it's not as 
accurate as it used to be, it wouldn't bother us.

10:48.219 --> 10:49.841
Past councils have taken that attitude. Yeah. But 
you want to turn that around? Yeah. And to do that,

10:54.127 --> 10:56.370
though, see, I've got to find the selling point 
I've got to go back and say and find that glory that

10:56.823 --> 11:04.495
goes with the citizen participation. If we only 
update those sector plans every eight years then

11:04.895 --> 11:10.844
nobody, well why sustain the sector councils over 
eight years? But if in fact you get into the annual

11:11.285 --> 11:22.662
updating mode then it's obvious that you've got to 
have these people in place and they've got to be

11:11.285 --> 11:22.662
informed and educated and you can't come in and 
reinvent the wheel each time so you have to have a

11:11.285 --> 11:22.662
sustained presence. That's my strategy, yeah. 
And that means staff, staffing. It means some

11:27.759 --> 11:32.167
staff, but it also means taking the staff we have 
and putting them over into those areas. And if it's

11:33.009 --> 11:40.482
a product, if we can generate enough new products 
out there that the council says we want to see you

11:33.009 --> 11:40.482
doing all of those things, then maybe over time we 
get more staff. But the way it is right now, it's

11:43.177 --> 11:47.671
more of a redirect the staff. Staff has never been 
the problem. I mean, it's just like with APA,

11:50.801 --> 11:53.931
chapter board of national. Bob, it's not staff, 
it's not money. It's doing something with what you

11:57.875 --> 12:01.240
have. It's a bias for action. It's putting your 
resources where they can make a difference and

12:03.182 --> 12:09.190
cutting them in areas where it doesn't. See, 
National was the same way. I tried to cut the budget

12:11.052 --> 12:13.996
up there, nobody could do it. We couldn't do it. 
There's always somebody wanting to protect that

12:15.157 --> 12:18.381
thing. It's the way it is here in city government. 
Somebody always wants to protect something out

12:20.082 --> 12:21.644
there. So I tell these people, we're just not 
telling anybody we're not doing it. We just quit

12:24.547 --> 12:26.610
doing it. Don't go out there and tell somebody. 
Don't confront them. I'm not doing it anymore.

12:30.754 --> 12:32.536
I'll tell the council, we want to cut out this 
thing. We just quit doing it. And heck, I got news

12:35.299 --> 12:38.803
for them. Nobody's going to miss it. Yeah. If it's 
been ineffective, who's going to care? That's

12:42.307 --> 12:43.408
right. Okay, well, Bruce, good luck in your 
relatively new position here. And we will be

12:50.616 --> 12:58.625
watching all of your successes as they appear one 
by one in the future. And thank you very much for

12:59.406 --> 13:02.089
your time again. And as I told you at the beginning 
of this interview, if you move again to another

13:02.129 --> 13:08.276
city, this is your last interview. Okay. So stay 
around a while, please. I'll move here again. It

13:11.660 --> 13:12.641
won't be a big city. It probably won't be in Texas. 
I'm going to get out of this planning business here

13:14.033 --> 13:17.852
one of these days, if I'm lucky. Thank you very 
much. You're welcome.
