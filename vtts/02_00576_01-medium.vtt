WEBVTT

00:02.275 --> 00:03.997
Okay, you were mentioning an example. As an 
example.

00:18.174 --> 00:19.395
Hold on just a minute.

00:23.821 --> 00:24.942
Lead us away. From the Soviets? Is that what you 
were saying? British attempts? Yeah, lead us away

00:29.504 --> 00:31.546
from the Soviets. Okay, and that's the Fulton 
County, that was an example. Yeah, no, this is an

00:34.509 --> 00:38.833
example that I intended to mention. 
Notwithstanding the black book, the sign with

00:40.555 --> 00:55.249
Churchill, Stalin, and Roosevelt, at Yalta, 
provided that immediately after the Germans

00:40.555 --> 00:55.249
capitulated, a reparations commission would 
meet in Moscow with a delegation from Britain, the

00:56.849 --> 01:16.057
United States, and one from

00:56.849 --> 01:16.057
Russia would convene and deal on the subject of 
German reparations.

01:19.603 --> 01:23.869
Mr. Truman's thought policy was, after 
Roosevelt's passage, that he would count all of

01:25.773 --> 01:30.280
Roosevelt's commitments.

01:32.884 --> 01:46.145
And our job was to count one of them, namely to join 
the assembly of this commission at Moscow

01:32.884 --> 01:46.145
immediately after the Germans capitulated.

01:49.089 --> 01:54.177
Well, we hurriedly formed our mission to that end. 
And we stopped in London. Two plane loads of us

01:58.867 --> 02:01.810
stopped in London on our way over. And we had a visit 
with the British. And they asked us, why are you in a

02:06.794 --> 02:08.175
hurry? And they just attempted to dissuade us from 
the immediate German movement to Moscow.

02:27.974 --> 02:41.808
of course we responded that we had no choice, that 
this commitment had been made by our previous

02:27.974 --> 02:41.808
administration, Mr. Truman, and said they wanted 
us carried out. And we left them with no assurance

02:43.931 --> 02:48.135
whatsoever that they were going to meet us in 
Moscow.

02:51.438 --> 02:56.023
And it was surprising to me that in the first place 
They even tried to dissuade us from going ahead.

03:07.670 --> 03:12.775
But when we got to Moscow, we took time enough to go 
over the ruins of Germany. We spent a few days at

03:14.738 --> 03:17.601
Frankfurt. And we divided ourselves up into 
groups of three to an automobile. We covered

03:27.138 --> 03:46.260
practically all

03:27.138 --> 03:46.260
the ruins of Germany as far east as Leipzig.

03:46.280 --> 03:49.463
And we went on to Moscow. We got to Moscow. The 
Russians did appear. The British did appear.

03:58.373 --> 04:02.477
So I would say there's something to that thinking.

04:10.785 --> 04:15.069
I'm sure Dr. Anderson will appreciate that. 
Briefly, how was it working with the British in

04:16.370 --> 04:19.854
this time period? I know you've answered some of 
that in what you've discussed. Can you briefly sum

04:23.157 --> 04:25.579
up how it was to work with the British and how it was 
to work with the Soviets. No relationship between

04:28.272 --> 04:31.594
the two, but straight-line British, 
straight-line Soviets. How was it to work with

04:31.614 --> 04:33.216
them in this time period?

04:37.460 --> 04:55.195
Well, it was both presented difficulty, but the 
difficulty

04:37.460 --> 04:55.195
with the Russians arose largely from the 
standpoint or the fact

04:58.583 --> 05:08.214
that

04:58.583 --> 05:08.214
they had little delegated authority.

05:10.997 --> 05:22.050
And

05:10.997 --> 05:22.050
they were deathly afraid of the British. The 
Russians were deathly afraid of the British.

05:26.140 --> 05:30.367
because the British, they said, had invaded them 
twice in this century. And from a standpoint of the

05:32.411 --> 05:42.728
British, the difficulty arose from a different

05:32.411 --> 05:42.728
source.

05:45.993 --> 05:51.743
That was

05:45.993 --> 05:51.743
all Foreign Service,

05:55.283 --> 06:21.511
procedures and activities of the British

05:55.283 --> 06:21.511
and has historically

05:55.283 --> 06:21.511
moved with a great deal of sophistication and a 
well-informed

05:55.283 --> 06:21.511
group of servicemen. They knew exactly what they 
wanted to do. and well organized, smoothly

06:26.789 --> 06:31.094
organized. They had a disposition of not wanting 
to give the Germans any reparations whatsoever.

06:41.506 --> 06:54.400
And

06:41.506 --> 06:54.400
that was very influential on, I'd say, a majority 
of our group.

07:00.522 --> 07:01.684
Does that answer your question? That answers the 
Great Britain. With the Soviets, you said there

07:03.646 --> 07:07.311
were problems with them. Getting back to the 
Soviet side, they expressed

07:07.411 --> 07:28.960
a great admiration for the Americans because the 
Americans fought seceded

07:30.273 --> 07:39.902
from Great Britain and fought the War of 
Independence and won it and had done very well. And

07:41.804 --> 07:57.799
they likened themselves to the Americans because 
they too fought a very difficult breach from the

07:41.804 --> 07:57.799
Tsars and had had a in holding things together.

08:09.187 --> 08:25.132
But the chief trouble in dealing with the Russians

08:09.187 --> 08:25.132
always clearly stemmed from the fact that they had 
to go back to headquarters for the answer to every

08:09.187 --> 08:25.132
question. It took time.

08:31.512 --> 08:32.773
required a lot of patience.

08:44.567 --> 08:50.614
They were very courteous to us in the summer of 
1945.

08:55.199 --> 08:59.764
There is, I'd say more so before the bombing came 
into existence.

09:06.982 --> 09:13.870
But I've always thought that the Cold War started 
at Muscat, at Ushtown. With Truman's statement

09:13.890 --> 09:17.494
about the bombing of T. Scotland. Yeah.

09:24.663 --> 09:31.911
On

09:24.663 --> 09:31.911
a more personal note, after the war, up to now. It's 
been said that you have been an advocate of liberal

09:35.430 --> 09:48.602
politics in the state of Texas for some time, and up 
to today's Texas Democratic politics. Could you

09:49.983 --> 09:57.450
discuss your involvement with the evolution of 
liberal politics in this state? And you might

09:58.851 --> 10:00.733
include Any involvement with LBJ?

10:05.773 --> 10:27.868
Well,

10:05.773 --> 10:27.868
I'll say that I've always

10:05.773 --> 10:27.868
figured that

10:05.773 --> 10:27.868
this democracy of ours could not go forward 
without the exercise of a good deal of liberalism.

10:36.402 --> 10:55.189
On the other hand, I've

10:36.402 --> 10:55.189
always exercised the independence

10:36.402 --> 10:55.189
of an action

10:36.402 --> 10:55.189
that is conservative.

10:57.853 --> 10:59.155
I believe in a balanced budget. I don't think you 
can run any kind of an institution successfully

11:01.109 --> 11:30.542
without a balanced budget and I'm not a liberal to 
the point of way

11:01.109 --> 11:30.542
you give away everything

11:01.109 --> 11:30.542
you've got to do things with reason And I've always 
been a Democrat. My first vote as a Democrat was for

11:38.151 --> 11:48.763
Woodrow Wilson when I was at the University of 
Texas Law School.

11:48.783 --> 11:55.771
And I think I voted for every Democratic president 
since. That includes Carlin. That includes

11:59.375 --> 12:00.917
Carlin both times.

12:04.053 --> 12:11.901
And

12:04.053 --> 12:11.901
I'll do the same thing this year, regardless of who 
it is.

12:17.147 --> 12:32.963
But I got out of my early study of government the 
definite feeling that you couldn't have a

12:17.147 --> 12:32.963
continuation of a democracy if we had a free 
society. without the exercise of a good deal of

12:34.664 --> 12:40.189
liberalism.

12:42.951 --> 12:47.135
I think the word, what I wanted to live with was 
everything is white and overplayed. I remember

12:47.475 --> 13:03.169
my wife told me one time that she had just read in the 
Chicago Tribune a story about

12:47.475 --> 13:03.169
a great liberal

13:06.271 --> 13:34.962
It seems that some prominent Republican had 
written the chairman of the National Republican

13:06.271 --> 13:34.962
Committee and told him that he wanted to give some 
money to the Republican Party,

13:06.271 --> 13:34.962
but he was disturbed because there wasn't a single 
liberal ever heard of in the ranks of the

13:06.271 --> 13:34.962
Republicans. And the chairman of the Republican 
committee promptly wrote the man back and told him

13:37.304 --> 13:53.586
that as an example of a liberal, he wanted to cite J. 
Howard Pugh as just having given the committee

13:37.304 --> 13:53.586
$50,000. And

13:53.606 --> 14:04.881
I think that is illustrating some people's views 
of what makes a conservative and what makes a

13:53.606 --> 14:04.881
liberal. the digits of life um now it's the lyndon 
johnson

14:07.426 --> 14:36.724
i met lyndon johnson early in the office of 
governor james v already he invited me to his

14:07.426 --> 14:36.724
office to meet lyndon he just announced for 
congress from the austin district where

14:07.426 --> 14:36.724
buckhannon the incumbent congressman had died.

14:41.189 --> 14:54.283
And I asked London what his platform was and

14:41.189 --> 14:54.283
he said in the first place he was going to help 
Roosevelt pack the court. Well, I had been through

14:56.945 --> 15:05.614
the School of Government at the University of 
Texas and the law school and I was pretty well

14:56.945 --> 15:05.614
steeped in the in the propriety of the checks and 
powers in government. And I scolded him. I said he

15:15.944 --> 15:29.318
shouldn't do that because it's wrong for one 
department of the Constitutional Department of

15:15.944 --> 15:29.318
the government to try to hobble another 
department. He went on and advocated the packet in

15:29.838 --> 15:34.723
the court and got elected. And later on I supported 
him when he ran for the Senate and I supported him

15:36.762 --> 15:52.822
when he announced for and did run for President of 
the United States.

15:56.426 --> 16:03.715
I was at Los Angeles and when he

16:12.858 --> 16:18.744
was requested by John F. Kennedy after he was 
nominated to join him on the ticket. And Johnson

16:20.466 --> 16:26.112
had the difficult decision to make as to whether he 
would or wouldn't.

16:28.834 --> 16:39.225
And everybody I knew in Texas and Los Angeles 
preferred that Lyndon stay in the Senate. He was

16:39.245 --> 16:40.266
majority leader.

16:44.498 --> 16:49.706
But I know Mr. Raymond expressed that feeling. 
Later in the day, Mr. Raymond told me that John F.

16:51.288 --> 17:03.006
Kennedy had come to see him and told him that he 
needed Lyndon to win the election. Needed him on

17:04.348 --> 17:05.269
the team. Needed to help him carry the South.

17:10.236 --> 17:13.341
And appealed to Mr. Raymond. that it was a matter of 
duty because 25 other Democratic senators had

17:14.570 --> 17:27.070
joined him in the request of London to join the 
ticket, and that as many congressmen had done the

17:14.570 --> 17:27.070
same thing.

17:30.015 --> 17:41.033
Mr. Raven

17:30.015 --> 17:41.033
told me that he finally said to John, well, John, 
since you put it that way, And if you'll get on that

17:43.544 --> 18:01.232
TV and tell the world that this is your idea, you are 
drafting Lyndon to go on the ticket with you, I'd

17:43.544 --> 18:01.232
recommend you do it. And John did make the 
statement, Mr. Raymond required that Lyndon join

18:01.252 --> 18:09.765
the ticket. And I thought Lyndon did the right 
thing. because he owed it to the Democratic Party

18:12.873 --> 18:21.226
and he owed it to the nominee in that respect.

18:21.246 --> 18:29.117
And I know that it wasn't very comforting to Bobby 
when John asked him when Lennon accepted. That was

18:29.137 --> 18:33.204
unfortunate.

18:33.224 --> 18:36.028
But I knew Lennon well.

18:39.673 --> 18:40.855
I was with him through

18:45.863 --> 18:54.914
his campaigns as Senator and President, and 
respected him very well. I couldn't agree with him

18:54.994 --> 19:09.232
on his Vietnam policy.

19:09.252 --> 19:11.955
I thought Lyndon was misled by the military.

19:15.833 --> 19:21.622
Did I answer

19:15.833 --> 19:21.622
your question? That's correct. Could

19:23.585 --> 19:33.520
you briefly discuss your involvement with the JFK 
administration?

19:33.540 --> 19:42.313
It was very brief because I

19:33.540 --> 19:42.313
was suffering at that time recovering from a 
broken bone

19:45.955 --> 19:49.578
right lower leg, right lower leg.

19:52.341 --> 19:57.606
And

19:52.341 --> 19:57.606
President Kennedy asked me to come up and help.

20:02.490 --> 20:09.376
The new Secretary, appointed Secretary of the 
Interior, organized his oil and gas department.

20:11.859 --> 20:15.422
And I agreed to and did. go up to do it. And after

20:18.512 --> 20:33.254
just six or eight weeks time I had finished that 
chore and then came back home. And that was about

20:35.437 --> 20:42.287
the consent of the service that I rented on that 
occasion.

20:46.064 --> 21:07.655
I put in more time for Mr. Truman when his Secretary 
of Interior was organizing the oil and gas office

20:46.064 --> 21:07.655
to meet the emergencies of the Korean War. I put in 
six, eight months of

21:14.532 --> 21:23.326
of organizing and establishing

21:14.532 --> 21:23.326
the Petroleum Administration for Defense. I had 
previously been there with Ickes as his director

21:25.109 --> 21:38.671
of transportation when Harold Ickes was 
administrator of the Petroleum Administration

21:25.109 --> 21:38.671
for War. And I put about three years on it.

21:47.472 --> 21:57.324
Right now, you are on the Board of Advisors of the 
Center for Defense Information. Pardon me?

21:58.986 --> 22:03.852
You're on the Board of Advisors of the Center for 
Defense Information right now. Are you not? No,

22:05.975 --> 22:07.937
I'm not active anymore. I've given up those 
assignments. You gave up those assignments?

22:11.502 --> 22:13.744
Yeah, I'm giving up those assignments. No 
involvement with them? Pardon me? There's no

22:15.282 --> 22:18.647
involvement with the Center for Defense 
Information now? Well, I'm advising, but I'm not

22:18.907 --> 22:26.718
an active participant. I'm not on the board of 
directors. I'm not an active participant, but I do

22:28.280 --> 22:32.806
support them. I communicate with them, but I don't 
attend regular meetings. What does CDI stand for

22:39.215 --> 22:41.338
right now? CDI stands for the Center for Defense 
Information. It's run by the leading officer

22:45.168 --> 22:56.606
there is Admiral Gene LaRock, a very able man. He's 
doing a commendable job. He's supported by

23:00.592 --> 23:13.032
retired Admiral Carroll, and he's got three or 
four generals

23:00.592 --> 23:13.032
in the organization. is doing a very effective 
work in research

23:14.210 --> 23:34.012
and giving authoritative answers to defense 
questions, answers respected even by the

23:14.210 --> 23:34.012
Pentagon, by the members of Congress. A lot of 
members of Congress communicate with them and

23:34.333 --> 23:37.836
rely upon them. And they take no part in politics 
whatsoever. They are not a political

23:44.180 --> 23:46.683
organization. It's simply a research and 
fact-finding institution. I'm also a sponsor of

23:52.229 --> 24:10.530
and a consultant with another organization in 
Washington.

24:10.550 --> 24:11.571
It's called the The

24:13.660 --> 24:30.916
moving spirit in that is Admiral

24:13.660 --> 24:30.916
Gaylor, Noel Gaylor.

24:34.960 --> 24:40.225
And the chairman of that board is George

24:42.263 --> 24:53.835
I'm the celebrated

24:42.263 --> 24:53.835
Poland ambassador to Russia, George Kennan.

24:55.096 --> 24:59.461
And the co-chairman is Bob McNamara.

25:01.243 --> 25:05.908
And I work with that organization.

25:07.469 --> 25:09.091
They do a different kind of work. It's 
fact-finding, too. They get a little closer to

25:13.921 --> 25:16.864
politics than CDI does. Two organizations 
complement one

25:18.486 --> 25:23.672
another. The style of this organization is the 
Committee on East-West Accord.

25:31.842 --> 25:41.633
And the design of that institution has been 
defined and recommends some alternatives to the

25:31.842 --> 25:41.633
president's nonpartisan Republicans and 
Democrats on it. Some alternatives to suggest to

25:47.371 --> 25:51.276
the Reagan administration. I don't know that he's 
ever took a recommendation yet. Might be. I was

25:58.706 --> 26:08.838
going

25:58.706 --> 26:08.838
to say thank you. But. something that just popped 
into my head that you might want to say on the

26:13.287 --> 26:17.332
record. Is there anything you would like to say to 
college students? What? To college students, the

26:23.780 --> 26:40.341
younger people of today, with your views, what you 
advocate, the course that you see America heading

26:23.780 --> 26:40.341
in, what could you say to college students who 
might direct that course for tomorrow? Is there

26:41.485 --> 26:42.807
anything you can say to him? Something that you 
would like to say to me now? Jeff, here are some

26:46.031 --> 26:48.915
general thoughts. Something to think about. The 
thing I would say to college students is to

26:50.838 --> 27:10.345
fortify your education by basing it upon

26:50.838 --> 27:10.345
a good, solid liberal arts education

27:11.860 --> 27:26.358
and let the choice of your profession, of your 
career, be decided after that base is

27:11.860 --> 27:26.358
established.

27:30.343 --> 27:31.185
Thank you very much. It's been a most gratifying 
interview.

28:49.853 --> 28:51.044
One, two, three, four. One, two, three, four.
