WEBVTT

00:02.596 --> 00:08.405
We thought regardless of what would happen, we'd figure out a solution and we'd get on with it.

00:08.425 --> 00:10.809
And by gosh, it's happened that way.

00:10.829 --> 00:28.215
So in hindsight, A&M was absolutely the absolute best thing that happened to Kathy and I. Have you summarized the special characteristics of being an Aggie?

00:31.115 --> 00:34.961
You live it, you don't talk about it would be the only other thing I'd add to it.

00:34.981 --> 00:44.877
It's, it's, it's, I think it would, Kathy was at UT System when bonfire happened.

00:44.897 --> 00:50.886
And, and we were really impacted because there was a D2 fish that was killed on the stack.

00:51.167 --> 00:53.811
And so I was down here that first day not even knowing that.

00:53.851 --> 00:54.933
And then I was over with D2.

00:54.973 --> 00:58.438
We had another one that was pretty injured as a freshman.

00:59.465 --> 01:08.447
And she had a hard time and I had a hard time explaining to people that we knew in Austin what it was like to be an Aggie.

01:08.468 --> 01:09.109
And we still do.

01:09.650 --> 01:12.277
And so you just don't, you just are.

01:13.099 --> 01:15.465
You don't explain it, you just are.

01:15.901 --> 01:27.516
And I don't think it's any, it may be different for some of the students, but I mean, we've got, it was funny, our next door neighbors, when we moved in in 90 to the house we're in, we're big Notre Dame.

01:28.136 --> 01:29.318
Both kids were gonna go to Notre Dame.

01:29.638 --> 01:33.243
Well, the oldest is a sophomore here now.

01:33.263 --> 01:37.488
And he has the same perspective of A&M that we do.

01:37.788 --> 01:39.090
And his younger brother, who was

01:39.678 --> 01:44.344
Most vociferous about not ever being an Aggie, and how could anybody be an Aggie?

01:44.364 --> 01:45.826
It's probably going to be here, too.

01:45.846 --> 01:52.355
What are the major factors that contribute to the development of that attitude, spirit, feeling?

01:54.639 --> 01:55.580
We make things happen.

01:55.620 --> 01:56.741
We want to have an impact.

01:59.185 --> 02:03.671
There's a camaraderie here that you don't see.

02:03.711 --> 02:06.134
There's other places of shared values.

02:06.495 --> 02:08.858
What causes that camaraderie, that sharing?

02:10.323 --> 02:16.493
At the base level, it's got to be Rudder and Williams' leadership and the people they brought here.

02:17.434 --> 02:18.956
Because that helps set the tone.

02:19.317 --> 02:25.306
But it's something that the students even going back to the first classes in Sully are all imbued with.

02:26.308 --> 02:27.630
We're different.

02:27.650 --> 02:28.371
We're proud of it.

02:28.952 --> 02:29.853
We're focused.

02:29.873 --> 02:31.015
We want to achieve.

02:31.501 --> 02:33.765
We've been successful.

02:33.845 --> 02:34.967
We want to be successful.

02:35.027 --> 02:37.551
All those kind of things I think are all wrapped up in it.

02:38.352 --> 02:49.309
I have a theory that there are some inclusive muster, bonfire, silver taps, yell practice, commencement.

02:49.329 --> 02:50.331
Everything.

02:50.551 --> 02:51.613
It's a tradition piece.

02:51.693 --> 02:52.274
It's everything.

02:52.454 --> 02:52.955
It's everything.

02:53.336 --> 02:54.758
I mean, that's what it is.

02:56.662 --> 03:00.267
And, yeah, the old 2% rule kind of goes by the wayside.

03:00.287 --> 03:10.119
I mean, it's how you deal with others, and that's a function of silver taps and muster.

03:10.440 --> 03:19.952
Because you're talking about people that have passed away that you may never have even known, but they're an Aggie, and you feel just as badly that they're not going to be here to make their mark.

03:20.523 --> 03:25.871
But it's also the other education and it's the academic education.

03:26.031 --> 03:37.308
It's the little things like going to the Grove to watch the movie in the summers and everybody cattened up and watching all the sophomores and juniors have long hair and we get it all whitewalled in August.

03:37.949 --> 03:44.639
It's staying in touch with people that you never thought you'd ever stay in touch with.

03:44.719 --> 03:48.184
It's walking into a room full of Aggies and feeling immediately at ease.

03:48.586 --> 03:52.511
And able to talk with people and not be able to do that in other situations.

03:52.912 --> 03:56.517
It's having a different language in some ways when you talk with people.

03:57.838 --> 04:04.848
It's about, at least the ones that I know, you don't hesitate to help connect to other Aggies.

04:05.409 --> 04:12.738
And I've hired other Aggies sight unseen because they were Aggies and specifically because they were in the MSC.

04:14.260 --> 04:15.522
Doesn't mean that I didn't

04:15.974 --> 04:20.641
have some challenges, but there's a common chemistry we all have to go through here.

04:21.201 --> 04:30.334
If you were a consultant, A&M's leadership today, what advice would you give them about A&M's future and how to do it?

04:30.354 --> 04:31.376
You're asking the wrong person.

04:31.396 --> 04:32.217
And how to do it.

04:36.743 --> 04:38.426
I think we aspire to greatness.

04:38.466 --> 04:45.576
We set good metrics, good objectives to get there, but I think we have lost sight.

04:46.062 --> 04:50.775
of what, of a vision of what this university can do.

04:50.816 --> 04:54.306
I think we can quantify what we want it to do, top ten here, these kind of things.

04:54.326 --> 04:55.870
I think we're really good at that.

04:56.137 --> 05:05.852
I think we've lost sight of not so much saying we're going to be the premier university but making it work day in and day out to get there.

05:06.993 --> 05:14.364
I don't, maybe I'm just overly sensitized on how we've all gotten so successful we're also fragmented.

05:15.426 --> 05:20.794
There's not a single, there's not like when we said let's go to the moon, let's go to the moon when

05:21.179 --> 05:30.010
I suspect when Rudder and Williams said, we're gonna be great, this is what we're gonna do, they did it, and the rest followed on, there's not that compelling vision.

05:30.891 --> 05:32.433
And sometimes I worry about that.

05:33.073 --> 05:36.217
We're real good at talking about leadership, but what's leadership?

05:36.478 --> 05:44.227
I mean, to me, leadership is the guy that stands 10 foot out in front of his rank and takes the bullet more often than not.

05:44.828 --> 05:46.550
And we haven't seen a lot of that.

05:46.910 --> 05:49.313
I mean, we see people say they're leaders,

05:51.098 --> 05:54.626
So we need to get a vision of what leadership is and a vision of what this university is.

05:54.847 --> 06:01.041
Let's make believe that you had the fiscal capability to make a truly important gift to Texas A&M.

06:01.563 --> 06:03.928
For what purpose would you want that gift used?

06:04.449 --> 06:09.040
Student leadership.

06:11.433 --> 06:26.834
Students in any of the real programs, and they can be a small society, they get hands-on experience of what it's like to work with people and how to achieve things and how to work together towards a common peace.

06:27.475 --> 06:30.820
I would look to see that with money left and right.

06:31.761 --> 06:36.748
Are you saying the kind of experiences you had in MSC?

06:36.863 --> 06:39.947
Not even just the MSC, even down to small clubs.

06:40.548 --> 06:45.035
I think the MSC in many ways is really great in many areas, but it's weak in areas.

06:46.397 --> 06:52.505
The reason I was a committee chair, the reason I loved being a committee chair, we were a small group at that time.

06:52.565 --> 07:00.356
You could see measurable, it wasn't quite a final, it was more qualified, but you could see measurable results that it was having on people.

07:00.937 --> 07:02.179
So if it's a small group,

07:02.699 --> 07:06.526
club that's focused on a certain area here at A&M, seed that.

07:06.767 --> 07:10.474
Give them opportunities to grow, that they may not have access to that.

07:10.494 --> 07:13.199
It's like how we struggled to get Operation Pegasus.

07:13.519 --> 07:16.084
I mean, it was a nickel and dime

07:16.672 --> 07:20.038
bailiwick deal, but we sure pulled it off, those kinds of things.

07:20.138 --> 07:35.103
And it would be things that, it would be giving students opportunities to achieve what they didn't think they could that's not academically based, it's not research based, and maybe not even large organization based, but it sure makes them a future community leader.

07:35.724 --> 07:36.866
And so it would be those kind of things.

07:37.207 --> 07:40.232
Okay, of all of my questions, we've got two more.

07:40.212 --> 07:46.661
to what A&M former students, faculty, friends, and so forth do you feel most grateful and why?

07:48.765 --> 07:50.187
Individually or as organizations?

07:50.207 --> 07:50.888
No, individuals.

07:56.796 --> 08:05.930
From student years, very clearly, Jack Williams would be at the very top.

08:08.133 --> 08:09.595
Followed very closely

08:10.351 --> 08:14.455
by John Coldes and Wayne Stark.

08:16.357 --> 08:17.599
There were a lot of others.

08:18.199 --> 08:19.080
You and Carolyn.

08:19.401 --> 08:25.407
I mean you at that time were getting ready to go to UTEP and that's what we started to talk about was my year in the MSC.

08:26.308 --> 08:33.656
So people that Jack had brought here or helped nurture here to grow the can-do attitude.

08:35.738 --> 08:38.721
You now more than back then because

08:38.971 --> 08:45.178
You unabashedly sat down and helped me try to figure out how to do some research that I was stuck in the mud on.

08:45.778 --> 08:49.903
So it's you and your peers that do things like that.

08:50.183 --> 08:51.164
And there's others.

08:51.545 --> 08:54.027
Vaughn would be in that category.

08:54.107 --> 08:57.051
Even Harry Schaffer would be in that category.

08:57.831 --> 09:03.898
People that took the time to energize and get you focused about where it was going.

09:04.132 --> 09:09.839
And over the last 25 years, Jim Reynolds and Jane Bailey would certainly fit into that one.

09:11.101 --> 09:13.924
Students, there's a bunch of us that still stay up with each other.

09:15.106 --> 09:18.570
I don't talk to Fred very much, but when I do, it's just like old times.

09:19.311 --> 09:24.237
Haven't seen Sue Rudd in ages, but Sue still contributes back on the board level.

09:24.257 --> 09:27.782
So you've got, and Bob Harvey and I caught up some chatting.

09:27.802 --> 09:30.445
Chet and I may even do some stuff on his campaign that's going around.

09:30.465 --> 09:33.649
So it's those kind of things, but the real glue

09:34.253 --> 09:35.857
were those names that I just mentioned.

09:36.498 --> 09:42.412
And probably the unsung here and all that just because it was such a tough year for my freshman was Dean Hannigan.

09:43.435 --> 09:48.246
If he had told me if I didn't get my act together, I was gonna be out doing other things.

09:49.128 --> 09:51.834
It took a while to sink in.

09:52.095 --> 09:52.937
It took,

09:52.917 --> 10:00.707
doing Pegasus and Hearing Corps staff and then at the same breath saying you don't qualify to focus on the grades.

10:00.727 --> 10:04.151
So I got the grades up enough that Wayne let me into the things that I did in the city.

10:04.792 --> 10:08.256
But it's people like that in Hal Gaines.

10:08.977 --> 10:09.898
Okay.

10:09.918 --> 10:11.480
I've only got one more question.

10:12.101 --> 10:15.145
Do you think of anything we should have dealt with we haven't?

10:17.977 --> 10:25.804
a lot more than maybe the freshman and sophomore years in the years on campus would be what makes Aggies what Aggies are.

10:26.765 --> 10:35.033
If there's a sequel to the oral history, that's a fascinating subject and I'll give you an anecdotal piece.

10:36.334 --> 10:42.820
We didn't do anything in D2 spectacular except become an outstanding unit three out of four years.

10:44.501 --> 10:46.363
That unit, and I was just

10:46.613 --> 10:49.718
blown away when I looked at John Adams' book.

10:49.898 --> 10:55.647
Just General Moore has like six or seven times it's won General Moore since those years.

10:56.348 --> 10:59.152
It's won Hockmouth seven or eight times.

10:59.913 --> 11:02.537
It won the grade chord.

11:02.557 --> 11:09.347
So two or three years out of every five it has one of the three major chords on their shoulders.

11:10.627 --> 11:24.549
you walk up in that dorm, one of the things I'll do after leave Vaughn is I'm going to go back up to the dorm because I do it once a year, it's still the same value, it's more organized, more focused, but it's still the same attention to we're going to be the best.

11:24.750 --> 11:27.173
We may not get there, but we aspire to be the best.

11:27.935 --> 11:29.197
We did that in the MSC.

11:29.978 --> 11:33.203
I know that student government did it in their ways as well.

11:34.365 --> 11:37.630
That aspiration, there's something in there so

11:38.065 --> 12:03.195
we did the oral history project you know you're doing the really neat stuff about how we got to stage one but then how does that carry forward over time and as we've gotten bigger it's probably got more spread out but I'll bet you there's still that same important pockets of people doing stuff some of them may not have any idea why they're doing it but it's all part of the core values here and that's what makes an Aggie an Aggie so that's the sequel

12:04.120 --> 12:11.188
Last question, what feelings do you carry in your heart for Texas A&M now?

12:11.208 --> 12:12.510
No feeling.

12:12.610 --> 12:15.814
I mean, it's me.

12:15.834 --> 12:17.496
It's my best friend at times.

12:17.516 --> 12:20.840
It's my best enemy.

12:21.621 --> 12:23.463
And that's very rare.

12:24.324 --> 12:30.972
I get frustrated when I see things that I can't, because of where I am in my life, have an impact.

12:31.542 --> 12:37.288
And I could see things being so much better if they were done just a little differently.

12:37.348 --> 12:39.330
Not a lot, but a little.

12:40.651 --> 12:45.236
There was a time when we started the MSC enrichment fund, I wanted to really help that grow.

12:45.616 --> 12:47.298
And it was way premature.

12:47.518 --> 12:50.141
They had to learn how to build the infrastructure to walk first.

12:52.103 --> 12:57.128
So I'm impatient about some things, but it is, it's everything Kathy and I are.

12:57.682 --> 13:03.472
If it hadn't been for A&M, I don't think we would have set out to be in business together to do the things we're doing.

13:05.135 --> 13:09.102
We close $15,000 in business in a week for a two-person shop.

13:09.122 --> 13:10.144
That's pretty cool.

13:10.865 --> 13:13.770
And that's after a $50,000 project we just completed.

13:13.951 --> 13:17.597
So we're doing nothing but playing MSC.

13:17.864 --> 13:23.452
And that's because the environment we were allowed to grow within and make mistakes here.

13:23.832 --> 13:25.274
You just don't see that anywhere else.

13:25.835 --> 13:27.497
And people we talk to, you just don't see it.

13:27.517 --> 13:29.880
So what would I do differently?

13:30.421 --> 13:32.264
And what am I as an Aggie?

13:32.764 --> 13:33.626
It's all those things.

13:33.926 --> 13:40.335
And the hardest thing is to think of your son wants to be a three-star general or four-star general.

13:40.976 --> 13:42.257
And we don't have many of those.

13:42.297 --> 13:42.918
We have some.

13:43.439 --> 13:44.901
And his attitude is...

13:45.725 --> 13:47.170
I can be one of those few.

13:47.952 --> 13:51.725
And I'm sitting here going, yeah, but West Point is, but you know what?

13:52.187 --> 13:55.297
I went and got him on summer recruiting list today, so who knows?

13:56.722 --> 13:58.367
He's as much an Aggie as we are.
