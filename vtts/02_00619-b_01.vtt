00:01.786 --> 00:08.337
Now, among the awards you have received, which 
ones have held for you personally the most

00:01.786 --> 00:08.337
significance? Well, awards are strange things. 
Once you get the first one, it's easy to get the

00:11.402 --> 00:15.168
second one, and it's very easy to get the third one. 
And once the dam is broken, they sometimes don't

00:15.189 --> 00:20.858
mean a great deal. We celebrated our centennial 
year a couple years ago in 1968 and I was very proud

00:21.310 --> 00:32.411
to be selected as one of the 15 people that are 
living and dead that have contributed most to

00:21.310 --> 00:32.411
Oregon State University. And this selection was 
made by a committee of the faculty and I'm

00:32.531 --> 00:44.213
unashamedly proud of being recognized for having 
changed the direction of the university.

00:45.509 --> 00:47.172
And I think that's the most important one. Of 
course, I like my honorary doctor of science.

00:50.398 --> 00:54.946
There aren't too many of those around for 
researchers of my caliber.

00:58.472 --> 01:09.492
And now, in terms of the direction of your 
research, which has now seemed to have found

00:58.472 --> 01:09.492
itself a niche, are there any research 
opportunities you've missed? that you feel a

01:09.944 --> 01:12.887
little uneasy about? Would you have possibly 
taken something else to task, some other sort of

01:13.668 --> 01:21.817
research challenge, if you'd had enough time? 
Well, I sort of feel badly that I didn't latch on to

01:24.320 --> 01:32.730
one thing and stick with it and become a real expert 
instead of sort of flopping around. And this is one

01:32.770 --> 01:39.057
of the reasons that I selected what I'm working on 
now and have stuck with it for five years. I don't

01:39.273 --> 01:43.717
believe that the proper thing is to jump around 
from one subject to another. This is sort of an

01:44.238 --> 01:51.445
opportunist method of doing research, and I think 
I would have contributed much more had I stuck to

01:44.238 --> 01:51.445
one thing. Except that oceanographers of your 
vintage tended to jump from area to area. Right.

01:59.493 --> 02:00.314
Some things are popular. Some things you can 
support at one time. A lot of it is serendipity. It

02:03.698 --> 02:08.082
just comes unexpected. Also, I do wish that I was a 
better mathematician.

02:14.558 --> 02:17.223
I feel limited in my mathematics. Most of the 
mathematics that's being used now by the younger

02:18.264 --> 02:24.936
modelers wasn't even invented until 10, 15 years 
ago. That's true.

02:28.983 --> 02:33.310
What, in your opinion, is the future of the 
satellite prediction system? Well, I'm

02:35.348 --> 02:38.311
continually amazed at what they can do with 
satellites. I would not have believed this

02:38.471 --> 02:50.965
anywhere along the line, that they could come up 
with reasonable near-surface winds, that they

02:38.471 --> 02:50.965
could, in effect, look through clouds and find out 
what's on the other side of them. After seeing this

02:50.985 --> 02:55.630
happen and being skeptical, I just can't see what 
the end is. They just keep improving things, and

02:55.770 --> 03:02.397
it's just almost like Matthew. So you're very 
optimistic about it. Well, I tell myself they've

03:05.690 --> 03:09.815
gone as far as they can go, but they just keep right 
on going. So I think that they're going to do more

03:09.835 --> 03:12.698
and more. I sometimes decry the fact that the 
amounts of money involved in satellites are very

03:13.639 --> 03:28.655
large compared to research on land, and I feel that 
somewhere along the line there might have been a

03:13.639 --> 03:28.655
little better division of funds. I think 
satellites sometimes are an overkill.

03:34.562 --> 03:35.443
Now,

03:38.663 --> 03:42.471
in directions that oceanography will probably 
go. I realize this is a very difficult question.

03:45.677 --> 03:52.992
What advice would you give to a young student at 
what particular field he should enter, what

03:45.677 --> 03:52.992
branch of oceanography, what he should look for? 
It's my phone and the secretary. I have some

03:56.238 --> 03:58.663
youngsters to get into.

04:02.542 --> 04:08.429
Well, I think it's a little too bad that quite so 
many of the brilliant youngsters are getting in

04:02.542 --> 04:08.429
strictly theoretical work. In particular, a 
tremendous amount of work is going into internal

04:08.950 --> 04:14.997
waves of various sizes and kinds. And I think that 
we need more people in the middle between theory

04:16.238 --> 04:22.085
and practice in the field. We tend to have 
descriptive oceanographers on one side to some

04:22.105 --> 04:29.474
degree and theoreticians on the other and not too 
many people in the middle. And I would advise any

04:30.135 --> 04:31.857
student to to try to get into the wedding theory to 
what actually is going on in the real world. Moving

04:39.798 --> 04:41.720
away from modeling then, possibly? Well, if they 
model, to also do some field work. And then to go

04:46.885 --> 04:47.966
back to sea. Right. Do you think with rising ship 
cost, it's going to be more and more difficult to

04:49.488 --> 04:56.055
get ship time to send oceanographers out to sea? I 
think it's going to become more and more

04:56.288 --> 05:04.217
difficult, but I think it's peanuts compared to 
other items in the federal budget. And I think that

05:04.237 --> 05:13.087
we're being very penny wise and pound foolish by 
not supporting more ship time. Now, there are

05:13.247 --> 05:15.089
ships and there are ships. And I think our money 
should be going into ships the size of our minimum

05:15.149 --> 05:23.138
deep ocean fleet, which is roughly 175 to 200 feet. 
These ships can be operated for like a million

05:23.258 --> 05:25.941
dollars a year. I don't think we need any more very 
large ships, these 300-footers, that don't

05:26.900 --> 05:35.732
really do much more than a 150-footer and cost 
three or four times as much to operate. So I would

05:36.173 --> 05:43.102
like to see a half a dozen more ships the size of the 
Wicoma if we have any new ships. And you think then

05:43.803 --> 05:50.813
that perhaps we have all of the big research 
vessels we need for... Well, I do. I've always...

05:52.668 --> 05:54.170
made this statement whenever I could. I think we 
have one or two big ones, and this is about all. The

05:58.216 --> 06:00.480
several that NOAA has is all the country needs. 
Okay, that's all I wanted to know. Now, do you look

06:02.803 --> 06:07.009
for more cooperative actions between 
institutions? That is, more things like MOPA, oh,

06:07.029 --> 06:15.902
that's a poor choice of words, but more deep ocean 
work with institutions collectively, like

06:07.029 --> 06:15.902
Scripps? This seems to be the direction that 
things are going. If you want to do deep ocean work,

06:22.942 --> 06:27.928
Your best chances of funding are to get into one of 
the IDOE programs and cooperate with someone

06:22.942 --> 06:27.928
else.

06:31.473 --> 06:41.185
I'd like to see a balance between individuals 
doing what they like to do and people who are forced

06:31.473 --> 06:41.185
to get under a tent and sort of tailor their 
research to a larger program. I think there needs

06:41.225 --> 06:42.486
to be a balance. And I think the balance is pretty 
good now, and I'd like to see it continue. OK. And I

06:47.533 --> 06:51.818
think if you're not opposed to this kind of deep 
ocean research, particularly, Well, not unless

06:52.186 --> 06:54.569
it soaks up all the mic. And I think that right now 
it's perhaps a 50-50 split or maybe a little bit

06:55.210 --> 07:01.979
stronger on the large programs. And I think that 
the balance is about where it should be. It doesn't

07:04.182 --> 07:06.264
change much more. What do you think about the 
obligations of Oregon State to work more and more

07:06.284 --> 07:10.190
inland? That is, to deal more and more with coastal 
waters and less and less with the oceans. State

07:14.756 --> 07:19.662
legislatures are putting a tremendous amount of 
pressure upon state universities. Well, I think

07:20.317 --> 07:29.631
that we would do this if the state had a bigger, 
well, supplied a greater percentage of our funds.

07:29.691 --> 07:33.897
But historically, the university has paid for 
teaching and this is all. We don't have any state

07:33.917 --> 07:35.700
funds to speak of. We get a little bit now and then. 
Now, in other states where they have larger

07:37.563 --> 07:47.794
programs, like Delaware and Texas and 
California, they get big chunks of state money to

07:37.563 --> 07:47.794
help do this and develop these programs. There's 
no way we can do this. We can't take money from an ONR

07:49.776 --> 07:55.182
grant or a contract or an NSF one and do state work. 
There's no way. ONR tells us, get into deep water.

08:01.389 --> 08:04.532
ONR feels that there's enough money going into the 
coastal areas area from other sources, so that

08:05.137 --> 08:11.487
there's no way we can do this and our hands are kind 
of tied. We feel a responsibility to the state,

08:11.507 --> 08:27.010
we'd like to do this, we've made abortive efforts 
several times to get started, but until we can

08:11.507 --> 08:27.010
convince some legislators that a unit here at 
Oregon State would be a good thing, and would need

08:28.441 --> 08:34.088
state support to keep it going, I think that we just 
sort of have our hands tied. Now, we have one

08:34.328 --> 08:37.252
breakthrough that's coming. We've done 
geophysics for the state. We run the seismographs

08:40.215 --> 08:44.440
and do a lot of survey work for the state. And there 
are some positions that will be set up and paid for

08:46.062 --> 08:51.449
out of state funds, and I think this is a start. You 
think that may be a beginning then? Yeah. But so

08:54.867 --> 09:00.673
far, the problem is getting one or two legislators 
all hepped up on this, and then it will work. But

09:00.693 --> 09:07.880
until we do this, we haven't done a good job of 
selling.

09:07.900 --> 09:15.428
Do you look for a reawakened interest in the oceans 
any time soon?

09:15.448 --> 09:24.317
Well, we've been hollering wolf ever since I can 
remember, and I think the public may be a little bit

09:15.448 --> 09:24.317
tired of this. Maybe we're at our peak interest now 
and we'll start going downhill.

09:31.455 --> 09:35.700
Does the current ecology movement bother you in 
terms of research? Do you feel uneasy with it?

09:38.343 --> 09:52.060
Well, I feel uneasy with it because I think that we 
are going to have to support our population, we're

09:38.343 --> 09:52.060
going to have to feed it, we're going to have to 
clothe it, build cars and things like this, and

09:38.343 --> 09:52.060
we've got to have a better balance. I decry 
stopping a dam that cost $100 million for half a

09:53.002 --> 09:57.528
dozen small fish. An ecologist would shoot me for 
saying this, but I think we have to have a little

09:57.568 --> 10:01.773
bit. We've bent over backwards to save the 
environment, and it's cost us a lot of money, and I

10:02.054 --> 10:07.401
don't think we can afford it. Do you feel uneasy 
with comments like Jacques Cousteau's that the

10:07.741 --> 10:11.186
sea's dying?

10:15.271 --> 10:20.037
I don't think he even believes it. Okay. The seas 
are not dying. As I said before, there are residual

10:23.562 --> 10:27.426
pesticides that are a problem. But aside from 
that, the oceans are a tremendous reservoir. Do

10:31.691 --> 10:50.751
you see any time in the near or immediate future 
establishing some kind of a system where sewage is

10:31.691 --> 10:50.751
used or really treated sewage or what have you, 
treated waste is used to feed certain parts of the

10:31.691 --> 10:50.751
sea? Well, this is out of my field, really. I don't 
have a thought about it. That's good enough. I just

10:56.696 --> 11:00.504
wonder if there's been much talk around your 
university about creating these kinds of things.

11:00.544 --> 11:02.127
None at all within our department. Okay.

11:06.616 --> 11:08.720
What does your department talk about in terms of 
research? What seems to be the direction they wish

11:08.780 --> 11:12.267
to take, your younger men in the department?

11:20.718 --> 11:30.633
Well, we have a very interesting, exciting 
geological program, which is to some degree

11:20.718 --> 11:30.633
resource-oriented in the future. And I think that 
they will continue with their work, and work of

11:32.837 --> 11:40.789
this type is a precursor to getting hard rock 
minerals out of the ocean. We did a big study with

11:43.052 --> 11:47.299
the University of Hawaii on the Nazca Plate off 
western South America that lasted two or three

11:48.865 --> 11:52.068
years.

11:55.231 --> 11:58.654
We've done work in rift areas near the Galapagos. I 
think eventually it'll become economically

12:00.216 --> 12:09.024
feasible to do hard rock mining and I think our 
people will help with this. Now, the next series of

12:09.044 --> 12:14.129
questions I have are really sort of about 
oceanographers you've known. What were they

12:14.149 --> 12:14.870
like? What seemed to be their interests? What were 
their characteristics? if you should like, what

12:18.616 --> 12:25.669
kind of cooperation or non-cooperation did you 
have with them? About the time you began,

12:25.789 --> 12:38.271
oceanography or the direction, if there were a 
triumphant, if I may say so, development of

12:25.789 --> 12:38.271
oceanography, it would have been, of course, 
Ewing and Revell et al., who were working in the

12:25.789 --> 12:38.271
early O&R office. What kind of recollections do 
you have of that? Well, personally, I never had

12:42.173 --> 12:46.679
much to do with either Ewing or Revelle. I met both 
on a number of occasions. I find them extremely

12:49.023 --> 12:51.887
fascinating people. They're not only good at what 
they're doing, but they're knowledgeable in many

12:51.927 --> 12:56.713
fields. I've listened to them both speak a number 
of times. I think we were very fortunate to have

12:59.457 --> 13:11.674
this type of inspirational leaders in the start, 
what you might say, in the step function increase

12:59.457 --> 13:11.674
in oceanographic research, which took place 
right after the war. I think oceanography has to

13:12.869 --> 13:24.080
some degree suffered because we've not been a more 
cohesive political body. And I've endeavored in

13:25.401 --> 13:37.934
the past to try to get some of the labs together to 
see if we couldn't influence the funding picture

13:25.401 --> 13:37.934
to some degree through Congress, and I've found 
that they're all independents. They don't want to

13:37.954 --> 13:38.935
get together. And I think this has hurt us to some 
degree. What sort of a unit would you conceive of?

13:44.947 --> 13:54.504
Well, I started up the Council of Oceanographic 
Directors specifically with this in mind about 10

13:44.947 --> 13:54.504
or 15 years ago, and it just died a natural death. 
The big labs weren't interested. The directors

13:56.808 --> 13:57.930
didn't even come. And the smaller labs just 
weren't politically powerful enough. We needed

14:02.177 --> 14:03.359
scripts in Woods Hole. And I think if there's one 
mistake the oceanographers have made, it's

14:03.379 --> 14:06.805
not... to have been a little more political. 
Should have combined their interest in terms of

14:10.824 --> 14:13.548
lobbying with Congress? That's right, in a word. 
No one of us could do much, but if we were all

14:16.892 --> 14:20.398
together, we could have. Are there any 
congressmen you should like to cite who have been

14:20.418 --> 14:26.246
particularly beneficial towards oceanography? 
I've been derelict in not following this closely.

14:32.756 --> 14:37.062
Senator Hollings has done a lot of good, I think, 
for oceanography. Some

14:37.801 --> 14:46.053
congressmen have done well by their own state 
laboratories, and I won't mention the closest

14:37.801 --> 14:46.053
one. University of Washington, I think, has been 
fortunate. They've done very, very well. And on

14:52.061 --> 15:04.298
the other hand, some of our congressmen have from 
time to time been able to help us and have always

14:52.061 --> 15:04.298
been very cooperative, but we haven't had the 
powerful committee chairmanship that some other

14:52.061 --> 15:04.298
states have had. I think if we could get California 
and Massachusetts together with all of us behind

15:06.421 --> 15:10.867
it, we could do something. But I've never been able 
to get people going. Think it's because Cripps and

15:13.730 --> 15:17.635
Woods Hole have pretty well dominated the field of 
oceanography? Well, they feel that they're

15:17.655 --> 15:23.663
powerful enough in their own right, and they don't 
want to get together with anybody else. Simple as

15:23.683 --> 15:28.549
that. Now, in terms of, let's say, while we're 
talking about these loose historic figures in

15:28.569 --> 15:36.259
oceanography, What do you think were the major 
breakthroughs that occurred in oceanography in

15:36.526 --> 15:42.297
your period of active research? If you were to turn 
to a student and say, look, this is what

15:43.299 --> 15:51.916
oceanography has done and this is why it was 
exciting, what would you cite? Well, of course,

15:52.858 --> 15:58.770
the biggest breakthrough has been the automation 
of data collection. I remember lecturing in 1947

15:59.729 --> 16:09.067
and stating, after he'd just come back from the 
cruise and he had 800 data points, he said, we just

15:59.729 --> 16:09.067
got too damn much data. And now a student will go out 
and come back with 2 million data points. Now, he

16:13.956 --> 16:16.641
could not have gotten that much data then. And he 
couldn't have done anything with it without

16:17.127 --> 16:19.390
computers. So it's the electronic system of 
gathering data and sensors and recording it, and

16:19.410 --> 16:27.681
then the electronic system of processing it. And 
without those two, I don't think we've gotten

16:27.701 --> 16:31.126
anywhere. Oceanography had no breakthroughs and 
was very primitive from the time of Nansen up until

16:32.368 --> 16:39.357
the time of Swerter. And then just within four or 
five years, we started. I think the first computer

16:42.181 --> 16:46.847
was used in a major oceanographic program, 
something like 1947. And that's only 20 years. And

16:48.268 --> 17:00.051
now our students feel absolutely

16:48.268 --> 17:00.051
put upon if they don't have a $10,000 budget for 
computers over the time they're getting their

16:48.268 --> 17:00.051
degrees. It costs about that, roughly that much on 
average for a physical oceanographic student.

17:05.913 --> 17:17.570
And along with this have come new mathematics, 
time series analysis, Fourier transforms, all of

17:05.913 --> 17:17.570
these things, which just weren't used when I was 
going to school. We'd never even heard of them. So

17:19.192 --> 17:21.255
you think technological innovations, then? 
Right. Well, I would agree with that, by the way.

17:29.126 --> 17:29.507
Let me... Ravel said that when he was asked what he 
had contributed, he thought, he said, I sent

17:30.263 --> 17:39.814
Scripps to sea, which may have been an 
overstatement. No, I think that's a good

17:39.874 --> 17:41.556
statement. And when Nirenberg was asked what his 
contribution to Scripps had been, he said, I

17:41.576 --> 17:49.104
brought to Scripps computers. Now, what I want to 
ask you is, in a short, pithy statement like that,

17:50.325 --> 17:58.174
what's your contribution been to Oregon State? 
What would you say?

18:02.123 --> 18:03.946
Oh, heavens, I don't know. Look around you. I think 
that if I did anything, it was I was able to organize

18:06.049 --> 18:16.503
a minimum amount of resources and produce with it. 
And by doing this and continuing to do it, I

18:16.804 --> 18:22.472
obtained support. And our growth was rather 
phenomenal. And it wouldn't have been this unless

18:25.897 --> 18:29.001
I'd had some organizational quality. So you 
think... Your primary contribution to Oregon

18:30.457 --> 18:34.241
State then was in terms of organization? 
Organization and getting the most out of the

18:34.362 --> 18:39.147
minimal amount of resources. So it could be I 
brought oceanography to Oregon State then.

18:42.791 --> 18:43.853
That's good enough, yeah. Yeah, there's no 
question about that. And what about in terms of

18:45.915 --> 18:47.417
your research? What do you think are the most 
important things you've done in terms of

18:47.437 --> 18:51.722
research? Oh, I don't think I've had any 
breakthroughs of any kind, really. I think my

18:54.825 --> 18:57.949
research is pedestrian and descriptive. but I 
think we need all kinds. When I was in graduate

19:01.427 --> 19:12.280
school, I was about ready to quit because I didn't 
have any flashes of genius compared to Walter

19:01.427 --> 19:12.280
Monks, and I went to see Svirt at one time, and all of 
a sudden I thought, well, I really didn't think I

19:01.427 --> 19:12.280
was up to it. And Svirt up to a big pyramid, and he 
says, for every genius up here, we've got three or

19:13.361 --> 19:25.877
four guys, sub-genius, and we get down, and 
wherever you are on the pyramid, as long as you're

19:13.361 --> 19:25.877
doing your best, you're needed, because it takes 
the whole thing to keep the business going.

19:28.861 --> 19:32.066
And I think that we need all types of researchers. 
And I do the best I can. And I don't think that it's

19:33.548 --> 19:35.411
been anything startling. But nevertheless, 
physical, I don't know how you can, one of the, you

19:36.192 --> 19:45.445
know, you realize I'm a rank outsider in this 
field, okay, and absolutely a baby in the woods.

19:45.465 --> 19:56.742
But one of the things that bothers me is there seems 
to be a drop in physical oceanography and in

19:45.465 --> 19:56.742
systematics, for example, outside of physical 
oceanography in terms of just classification of

19:45.465 --> 19:56.742
organisms. students don't seem to be willing to do 
these kinds of things. How can you do oceanography

19:59.400 --> 20:02.003
if these things are not done? Shouldn't there be 
some kind of a move towards basics in your field,

20:02.724 --> 20:08.732
towards students who are willing to collect and 
describe? Well, I think so, but the tendency is not

20:10.514 --> 20:13.939
to fund this sort of thing. I don't think the 
problem is so much the students or the

20:13.959 --> 20:17.403
laboratories. I think the problem is in the peer 
review system that NSF employs. If you put in for

20:23.351 --> 20:25.193
purely descriptive purposes, pedestrian type 
research proposal, your chances of getting it are

20:25.679 --> 20:32.668
not really too good.

20:35.532 --> 20:44.344
And unless you've got a theory all worked out and 
practically have all the solutions before you

20:35.532 --> 20:44.344
start, your chances of getting money for this type 
of work are getting harder all the time. Now, there

20:44.384 --> 20:46.607
are a few stars that continue to get money for this, 
but I think that the numbers are

20:47.077 --> 20:56.786
disproportionate, because most of the younger 
guys are theoretical, and if you don't have some

20:47.077 --> 20:56.786
theory in there, your chances are fairly slim. 
Now, this may be sour grapes, but I think it's a

20:57.687 --> 21:01.170
fact. Are you unhappy with the peer review system 
of the NSF? I think it's the best we could have. I'm

21:05.574 --> 21:06.896
not unhappy with it, no. No, I'm not unhappy with 
it. To those of us in the field of history, if I may

21:08.837 --> 21:15.784
ask you to draw some comparisons here, we 
sometimes feel that we're in the provinces. if you

21:16.270 --> 21:27.161
allow this, we teach at UT, that people from 
Harvard and Yale tend to get the grants because of a

21:16.270 --> 21:27.161
sort of an in-group, if you should like. Do you feel 
that possibly the same sort of discrimination is

21:28.382 --> 21:33.447
applied to the people in the sciences? That is, the 
bigger laboratories and the bigger

21:33.967 --> 21:40.614
oceanographic institutions seem to have better 
luck finding grants for their students or

21:33.967 --> 21:40.614
financing their research? Well, I can't complain 
because I've been able to work with the system and

21:42.095 --> 21:46.159
do all right.

21:48.215 --> 21:50.297
I'll withdraw that question.

21:53.780 --> 22:03.388
If I were to ask you, and which I intend to, what you 
considered your major accomplishments in your

21:53.780 --> 22:03.388
academic and scholarly career, what would you 
list? Well, just making this place go. All right.

22:07.432 --> 22:07.952
This is it. OK. Aside from that, I think that I've 
added bits and pieces of descriptive material to a

22:07.972 --> 22:16.500
number of different fields, which are all part of 
the mosaic But nothing's darling. But then I think

22:19.846 --> 22:25.695
then that you would agree that when Fleming says 
his major thing was establishing an apartment at

22:19.846 --> 22:25.695
the University of Washington. Right. My major 
thing is the same. Your major thing was

22:27.337 --> 22:29.180
establishing one at Oregon State. And I want to 
make sure we get this on tape because it's hard for a

22:30.181 --> 22:34.228
student, I think, to realize it. But that's, in 
effect, bringing oceanography to a place it had

22:34.248 --> 22:40.477
not been before, the Pacific Northwest, a point 
you've never really made clear, I don't think.

22:40.597 --> 22:41.779
Yes, I think this is true. Because all the work had 
been done in Southern California, in

22:41.962 --> 22:50.996
Massachusetts, been no really Texas coastal work 
done or work done in the Pacific Northwest to speak

22:41.962 --> 22:50.996
of until these institutions came here. Okay. And 
this is the second one. The Chesapeake Bay

22:54.962 --> 23:00.710
Institute, Don Pritchard and I started that from 
Holcroft, too. And it was the same sort of thing on

23:01.211 --> 23:03.154
the East Coast. I really wasn't aware of that. 
Right. I guess that was the first oceanographic

23:05.478 --> 23:09.083
institution to be established After the war. 
After the war, to work those estuaries, is that

23:10.431 --> 23:12.814
right? Right, right,

23:12.974 --> 23:17.740
1948. See, Columbia was set up about sometime 
during the war. Miami was set up a little bit before

23:22.647 --> 23:24.509
that. But then

23:25.911 --> 23:36.184
Johns Hopkins, Texas A&M, Oregon State, Alaska, 
Hawaii, just warm fell in right after that. Now...

23:40.349 --> 23:45.755
I want to ask a couple of things about the 
Chesapeake Bay along that way, because as I say,

23:40.349 --> 23:45.755
I'm confessing to you very quickly. Had there not 
been any work done then along that part of the...

23:46.616 --> 24:01.294
Well, at Solomon's Island and at Gloucester 
Point, Virginia and Maryland each had a marine

23:46.616 --> 24:01.294
biological station, which was a summer station 
that did a little bit of hydrographic work, but not

23:46.616 --> 24:01.294
a great deal. And if they had been fulfilling the 
need that was there, then the states certainly

24:03.468 --> 24:13.740
wouldn't have given Johns Hopkins $30,000 apiece 
to start up a new laboratory. But they were mainly

24:13.941 --> 24:18.065
classical marine biological stations. Oh, okay. 
When you began to organize this new laboratory,

24:20.849 --> 24:25.795
what did you tell yourself the first thing was that 
you needed? Oh, we've got to get a boat first. So we

24:29.199 --> 24:30.200
bought a little boat. And then we... had one built. 
We had a fleet, I think, of three or four small

24:34.853 --> 24:37.356
boats. The biggest one was perhaps 25, 30 tons, 60 
feet long.

24:45.945 --> 24:52.532
And then we started out doing hydrographic and 
chemical work on the estuary and covered it pretty

24:45.945 --> 24:52.532
well for three or four years. And did you work 
primarily there with government contracts? It

24:56.997 --> 24:58.178
wouldn't seem likely to me. Well, we got $30,000 
from ONR, $30,000 from and $30,000 from Maryland,

25:02.362 --> 25:06.366
and that was a lot of money in those days. Then along 
came the Korean War, interest surged, a committee

25:07.207 --> 25:26.428
came around and asked us how much could we grow, and 
Pritchard said some number out of his head, I think

25:07.207 --> 25:26.428
it was $200,000, so we got a $200,000 jump at that 
time, and then that's where the institute really

25:07.207 --> 25:26.428
began to develop. Did you try to bring in young 
scholars to work there? Did you get postdocs and

25:29.013 --> 25:32.178
this sort of thing? Well, postdocs in 
oceanography weren't as popular then as they are

25:32.258 --> 25:36.644
now. And part of this reflects the job situation. 
Then anybody could go get a job. You didn't have to

25:40.791 --> 25:42.153
be a postdoc. There was no particular advantage, 
unless you particularly wanted to study with some

25:42.193 --> 25:47.381
individual. Now jobs are a little harder to get so 
that there are more people that are using postdocs

25:47.421 --> 25:55.032
as an interim thing. At least that's my 
impression. Maybe extra. It seems like now almost

25:58.504 --> 26:03.811
all scientists go off on a postdoc for a while, and 
I've often wondered why that. So I think it's a good

26:04.272 --> 26:11.803
idea, and a few of our students have gone on 
postdocs and then come back to work at Oregon

26:04.272 --> 26:11.803
State. And I think, by and large, they've 
benefited by it.

26:17.572 --> 26:21.357
Now, when you get this $200,000 jump all of a sudden 
in your budget, then what do you do? Well, we

26:22.298 --> 26:26.123
scramble around and hire some people.

26:28.706 --> 26:29.507
I don't know. If you're on a small budget, then you 
sort of dream and think about what you do, and then

26:30.949 --> 26:37.377
you have certain plans in the back of your mind.

26:40.160 --> 26:46.408
For example, when I had nothing here, I went to the 
Ford Foundation and asked for $60,000 to buy a

26:40.160 --> 26:46.408
small boat. The Ford Foundation sent a panel out. 
They looked the place over. and came back and said,

26:51.003 --> 26:54.628
the place has absolutely no chance of 
development. Went down to Scripps and gave him $3

26:54.648 --> 26:59.334
million for a new biological program. And this was 
about 1957. So

27:00.857 --> 27:09.248
I did have ship plans and ideas no real long-range 
plan, but had various alternates that I could do,

27:09.532 --> 27:14.198
and this is what I did. I had these ready to go when 
the money became available in the early 60s. And

27:18.744 --> 27:21.106
then you just said, okay, now the money's here, 
we'll do this. And with a particular set of

27:21.727 --> 27:26.073
priorities, I take it, beginning each time with 
vessels. Right. You have to have a vessel. That's

27:28.195 --> 27:28.876
the first thing. Did your experience at 
Chesapeake Bay, did this help to shape your

27:29.217 --> 27:35.124
administrative experience when you arrived here 
at Oregon State? I think so, yeah. You think that

27:37.780 --> 27:42.826
You made your mistakes up there, so to speak?

27:45.229 --> 28:05.374
Well, actually, I had two or three years of 
administrative experience at Scripps with the BT

27:45.229 --> 28:05.374
section, and at the start of the war, I caught 
pneumonia, so I couldn't get into the service, and

27:45.229 --> 28:05.374
I worked for a shipyard in Portland, and they were 
so desperate for people that if you could read a

27:45.229 --> 28:05.374
blueprint, you were an automatic engineer, so I 
had... Eight or ten people working under me in an

28:06.316 --> 28:15.806
engineering capacity and had charge of building 
the sub-assemblies for 30 LSTs and a bunch of

28:06.316 --> 28:15.806
carriers. And this was a good experience and one 
that I normally wouldn't have gotten at that age.

28:23.635 --> 28:27.078
And then three years in the Navy was all a good 
experience.

28:29.861 --> 28:36.188
So that I had had administrative experience for 
five or six years before I got into oceanography.

28:37.771 --> 28:45.781
When you get your first commission, let's say, in 
terms of money to build a vessel, do you design it?

28:47.923 --> 28:56.153
Well, I've got the best architect I could, but 
actually, largely I design the vessels that I've

28:47.923 --> 28:56.153
worked on. I'd rather do that than anything I can 
think of. Oh, okay. And I know this is a naive

28:59.759 --> 29:04.988
question, but what's the first thing you begin to 
look for when you start to design it? Do you say,

29:05.489 --> 29:07.974
what's the biggest thing I can get for the money? 
Oh, okay, that's the way we begin. All right, for

29:11.079 --> 29:18.332
example, I got $250,000, which I should have been 
satisfied to build a 65-foot vessel with. I've

29:18.352 --> 29:21.258
managed to get another $50,000 of return 
overhead. That gave me $300,000. And then I shot

29:23.738 --> 29:25.060
for an 80-foot. Well, the size goes up to the cube of 
the length. And instead of getting a vessel that

29:27.644 --> 29:32.571
would be extremely limited, I built the Ocona, 
which is operating out of Alaska now. And it's

29:33.252 --> 29:36.457
doing a fine job.

29:37.539 --> 29:44.589
The first thing I look for, first of all, you have to 
have a vessel that will do the work you want. But

29:44.609 --> 29:47.113
then I'd look for creature comfort. Make the 
quarters as good as I can, the eating facilities as

29:47.133 --> 29:51.940
good as I can.

29:54.367 --> 30:01.396
People are out there crowded on a small vessel for a 
long period of time, and they need creature

29:54.367 --> 30:01.396
comfort if you can possibly give it to them. And I 
think one of the reasons our people seem to be happy

30:01.416 --> 30:06.202
on our ships is that we've tried to do this. Worked 
for Living Corps. When you're on the ship now, if

30:09.927 --> 30:18.298
you're out on the voyage, do you still go through 
the whole process of pulling watches and the whole

30:09.927 --> 30:18.298
business as one once did when one was a student on 
the vessels? Well, you do stand watches, but as a

30:18.920 --> 30:23.605
senior citizen, I avoid it if I can. I just do what 
I'm out there to do. But for example, on the

30:25.647 --> 30:34.697
Japanese ship, I didn't stand any watches because 
we had about 50 students and other scientific

30:25.647 --> 30:34.697
personnel. On the British ship, I stand regular 
watches.

30:40.162 --> 30:44.387
I don't do any real hard work, but there's always 
something going on around the clock. And I usually

30:44.908 --> 30:47.290
work about 8, 12 hours a day. is awfully hard to 
meet. Well, what sort of innovations have taken

30:50.665 --> 30:55.730
places in the ships themselves? What are the most 
important things to have been done to the ships in

30:55.750 --> 31:00.495
terms of facilitating research, except 
computers? The most important single thing is a

31:00.515 --> 31:03.118
satellite navigator. A satellite navigator. 
There were times when you didn't know within 20

31:04.179 --> 31:09.084
miles where you were in bad weather over a long 
period of time. And then we got Loran, which was

31:09.104 --> 31:14.290
reasonably good.
