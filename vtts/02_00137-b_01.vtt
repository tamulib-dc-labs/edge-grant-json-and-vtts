00:03.102 --> 00:16.603
Talking about the times of change and of achievement, Fred Benson was dean of engineering for a while.

00:18.045 --> 00:26.157
Was engineering, under his leadership, also cooperative with oceanography and the geosciences?

00:26.457 --> 00:28.503
I liked Fred Benson very much.

00:28.823 --> 00:32.052
He was also an officer of the Research Foundation.

00:34.378 --> 00:36.484
When it came to forming a new college,

00:37.004 --> 00:41.770
I had proposed that geology be put in a new college, which meant taking it away from his.

00:42.331 --> 00:46.416
So I talked to him about it, and he said, well, wherever it fits, it was easy going.

00:46.957 --> 00:57.070
He had never gotten a PhD, as I recall, but he had an absolute key role, I think, in the Research Foundation and the School of Engineering.

00:58.412 --> 01:06.623
He was a relatively low-profile type of person, but very friendly, very helpful.

01:07.312 --> 01:31.484
Back in the early 60s, as A&M looked at what it might become, and out of that look to the future came a number of changes, co-education, voluntary core, racial integration, did you and your colleagues in the geosciences area have any opinions about those changes?

01:33.947 --> 01:37.251
Well, the period I was here from 49 to 50,

01:37.906 --> 01:40.529
69, a lot of those things happened.

01:41.590 --> 01:43.132
It was just interesting to watch them.

01:44.913 --> 01:52.081
I noticed particularly now, in those old days, we had no colors on the football team, and now it's a majority.

01:52.101 --> 01:59.669
I wonder why we can't have a little more competition from some of the white fellows.

02:00.090 --> 02:05.095
The girls coming, I think oceanography was very close

02:05.615 --> 02:12.521
and meteorology particularly to attracting women in those eras.

02:13.722 --> 02:18.807
But the Corps was awfully strong and awfully good, of course, for its purposes.

02:19.888 --> 02:25.293
So there were very significant days, but it's just evolution, I guess.

02:25.873 --> 02:30.778
Were you, did anyone ever attract, attempt to lure you away from here?

02:30.818 --> 02:33.360
Hmm.

02:34.252 --> 02:38.701
No, I mentioned I had a chance for the dean of the graduate school.

02:38.802 --> 02:42.449
I also was offered the position of director of the research foundation.

02:43.010 --> 02:50.927
And when Dr. Jackula passed away, I was made the executive associate director, I think, of the foundation.

02:51.717 --> 02:54.801
And Dean Barlow was also an associate director.

02:55.161 --> 02:59.787
He agreed that whatever I would decide as administrator, he'd go along with.

03:00.949 --> 03:06.856
So I turned down both those offers, and I often wonder what would have happened if I'd accepted either one.

03:06.876 --> 03:12.183
I just felt they were both too far removed from the actual subject matter.

03:13.605 --> 03:20.273
And my greatest satisfaction has been from some of the subject matter things that I was later able to publish, I think.

03:22.210 --> 03:32.187
As you look back on that whole period, who were the key faculty hires during your period of leadership?

03:34.651 --> 03:36.253
Which faculty made the most difference?

03:37.455 --> 03:41.502
Well, the only faculty that I really hired were the five original ones.

03:42.072 --> 03:48.220
A lot of the rest came because they had some kind of a project that fitted in, could support themselves in part.

03:49.562 --> 03:59.296
One exception to this was Walter Saussure, who was a meteorologist, and our teaching helped to point where we were able to justify one appointment for meteorology teaching.

04:01.539 --> 04:04.242
I made a list of some of the key people.

04:04.262 --> 04:06.866
I can't rattle those off.

04:06.886 --> 04:09.109
Hugh McClellan is the one that I recall.

04:09.427 --> 04:20.503
I had mentioned him and his role in the ship development, but I can quickly think up some others.

04:20.784 --> 04:30.017
For example, Syed El Syed, who came here without university support, built an international program, George Huebner,

04:30.605 --> 04:32.608
who was a graduate electrical engineering.

04:32.648 --> 04:35.812
He started to work in the Gulf before I came, tracking hurricanes.

04:36.213 --> 04:38.015
He'd been here all the way through.

04:39.297 --> 04:48.609
Sammy Ray mentioned the building in Galveston, who built up the Galveston Marine Lab, the Galveston University section, became president of it.

04:49.230 --> 04:50.672
He was a key hire.

04:51.395 --> 04:55.181
And then some of the people are not here this time.

04:55.222 --> 04:57.726
John Freeman was the first meteorologist.

04:57.746 --> 05:02.374
We hired him on Oceanography Project, but he was really a full-time professional meteorologist.

05:02.394 --> 05:03.776
That's when meteorology started.

05:04.337 --> 05:08.965
Vance Moyer was head of the department for both during the...

05:09.755 --> 05:16.302
He was head of the meteorology section in our department, and later he was head of the meteorology department in the new college.

05:16.703 --> 05:17.784
He's a very key person.

05:18.525 --> 05:28.276
Robert A. Clark was in hydrology, worked in radar meteorology, became the key officer in the National Weather Service in hydrology.

05:29.056 --> 05:36.825
Those were some, then geological work, John Antoine and Arnold Balmer were key people who came.

05:37.362 --> 05:39.624
Those are some of the ones that I would mention.

05:39.684 --> 05:46.511
Worthnell, of course, was one of our graduates who became department head, became an associate dean, has great influence on the college.

05:47.772 --> 06:01.184
If you could give the Texas A&M administration today advice, what advice would you give them about the authority of the chief administrator of a department?

06:02.506 --> 06:07.150
Whether we call it a department head or a chairman, what authority do you think that person ought to have?

06:08.395 --> 06:19.111
Well, I think it depends upon the job description they made for him and for the department and the statement of mission of the school that he's in.

06:21.595 --> 06:25.541
Those things have to be tied to his own interests and hope they all make a good package.

06:25.621 --> 06:25.861
All right.

06:26.021 --> 06:27.824
Let's make believe then it's oceanography.

06:27.904 --> 06:30.488
What would you have as the mission there?

06:32.511 --> 06:33.913
Now, what is it you want me to say?

06:33.973 --> 06:37.879
What would be the role of the department leader?

06:37.977 --> 06:44.055
whether we call it department head or department chairman, what would you have that person responsibility to be?

06:44.795 --> 07:01.915
Well, I'd say the key thing is to keep the curriculum going and to improve the teaching and doing that by utilizing research projects to provide equipment and provide opportunity for field work and data for theses and so on.

07:02.736 --> 07:08.302
So it's the academic excellence, I guess, would be the way to summarize that.

07:09.504 --> 07:10.885
How would you select that person?

07:12.287 --> 07:12.507
Oh, boy.

07:13.583 --> 07:18.548
Well, here again I would mention that there needs to be a mission in the department

07:19.051 --> 07:46.341
and if the university knew what that mission was do they want to emphasize one area or another you have two choices one is to say well all departments are equal give a share of our support to each one equally or i think we can make a name in this field and let's let's put more of our emphasis on that area become known in that area and keep the other departments good but not

07:46.962 --> 08:02.404
I don't know how you would word that, but you either have to have everything all the same, which usually tends toward mediocrity, or else you've got to choose something to prioritize and feature.

08:02.424 --> 08:05.007
And I believe you're leaning toward the prioritize, aren't you?

08:05.528 --> 08:05.788
Yes.

08:07.350 --> 08:15.602
Would that also apply to colleges, that some departments in some colleges might get greater emphasis than others?

08:17.725 --> 08:19.647
Yes, I think usually it applies.

08:19.687 --> 08:30.980
However, there are some colleges which are so good around the whole area, all their departments kind of fit that one area of excellence, that's fine.

08:31.000 --> 08:41.932
But in most colleges, they just cannot become fully acknowledged and recognized in all fields.

08:42.232 --> 08:46.737
So they have to choose and put emphasis on certain ones.

08:47.628 --> 08:55.861
How long should the department leader, and I'll call him department head from now on, how long should the department head serve?

08:56.522 --> 08:58.586
Well, that's a very interesting question.

09:00.950 --> 09:03.734
Some departments consider this as a chore.

09:04.796 --> 09:11.627
I mean, the people consider it as a chore, and they're happy to get out of it after a couple years, which means that they...

09:12.248 --> 09:17.295
usually did not have or develop a sense of direction while they were there.

09:17.676 --> 09:21.381
There was not time to do this and to build.

09:22.603 --> 09:33.058
An interesting comparison here, since I worked at the Naval Postgraduate School, the customer is to change superintendents who are an admiral and change maybe every four years or so.

09:33.730 --> 09:36.915
Well, there's certain advantages to that and certain disadvantages.

09:38.217 --> 09:42.322
Usually the Admiral comes in, he knows he has four years and he has to make a mark.

09:42.763 --> 09:45.487
So he asks, how can I make a mark and do it in four years?

09:46.428 --> 09:47.770
And that's not too good.

09:49.333 --> 09:50.174
I guess it depends.

09:50.234 --> 10:01.290
If you're starting a new department and if you can find the right head for it, then he should have a chance to lay out his ideas and build them over a period of time.

10:01.793 --> 10:06.300
It does take time to accumulate the right faculty and get them fitted together.

10:06.340 --> 10:12.428
In my case, I was head for 15 years, and that was a real great advantage from my point of view anyhow.

10:13.670 --> 10:18.978
Should the department head feel bound by a majority vote of the department always?

10:18.998 --> 10:24.025
I don't think you can be bound by the department vote.

10:24.065 --> 10:28.712
They don't have the contacts that the head has.

10:30.008 --> 10:35.814
Usually you just end up in confusion when you try to get a group decision.

10:39.978 --> 10:45.483
What is the public responsibility of an academic department?

10:46.024 --> 10:55.273
What should, in oceanography, does the department have almost some unwritten obligations of public service to the region?

10:56.941 --> 11:04.274
I don't know whether it's an obligation, but I do think it's a good thing and almost a necessary thing.

11:04.975 --> 11:12.368
The unfortunate thing is that a lot of these contacts want to be with the head of the department.

11:12.770 --> 11:18.516
The ideal thing would be if every department member had some of the contacts, but I think back of the various things.

11:19.117 --> 11:39.638
I was on the board of the hospital, on the board of the Barcrest Development, the board of the Presbyterian Church, just an innumerable bunch of community relationships, and it was very hard to do them well because so many, and yet I couldn't figure any way to turn them over to another person.

11:40.428 --> 11:54.707
And you and the department also spent a great deal of time out of this county, out of this region, speaking to industry and to other public groups, I think, also.

11:55.480 --> 11:57.202
Which was a good investment.

11:57.222 --> 11:57.603
Oh, yes.

11:57.903 --> 11:59.346
Promotional in a way.

12:00.027 --> 12:09.079
But what I found is that, like the Dow Chemical Company, I spoke at their annual meeting once, and then the next year they wanted me to come back.

12:09.360 --> 12:15.589
Well, giving a speech of that sort, what they expect is entertainment, really, as well as the knowledge.

12:18.413 --> 12:22.078
They expect the same entertainment they would get if they paid somebody to

12:22.295 --> 12:25.401
come in for $10,000 or something, and you can't compete.

12:25.481 --> 12:26.664
You just can't do it.

12:27.225 --> 12:33.296
A good speech requires real effort, and you can only do a certain amount of this.

12:33.958 --> 12:37.224
I always found that talking to engineers was my most interesting thing.

12:37.304 --> 12:42.835
Engineers seem to react in a way that general audiences don't quite.

12:42.815 --> 12:45.302
depending on your subject matter, of course.

12:46.004 --> 12:48.731
But everybody wants a program.

12:49.353 --> 12:52.842
Every institution, every little organization has to have a monthly program.

12:53.412 --> 12:55.574
and they go to great lengths to get them.

12:55.595 --> 12:56.676
I mentioned Rotary Club.

12:56.716 --> 12:57.997
I was in Rotary 40 years.

12:58.017 --> 13:02.523
I went down to Houston to talk to Rotary Club, and they had their business meeting.

13:02.583 --> 13:04.945
When they got through, there was five minutes left for my talk.

13:06.207 --> 13:09.991
The opposite extreme, another talk, the Houston Central Rotary Club.

13:10.672 --> 13:11.653
I'd come back from Russia.

13:11.673 --> 13:15.117
I had a nice set of colored slides of Russia, and they knew I'd been in Russia.

13:15.097 --> 13:26.913
So a talk was on that, and I went up to set up a slide projector, and they said, this is about 15 minutes before the program, they said, we can't show slides in here.

13:27.293 --> 13:32.660
There are going to be 600 people, and they go way back into the woodwork there, can't show slides.

13:33.882 --> 13:41.492
And what I did is pile the slides in a pile and use them for notes, and that talk went over better than any time ever.

13:42.923 --> 13:50.971
But anyhow, people expect too much from a free traveling professor, let's say.

13:51.472 --> 13:52.092
You can't do it.

13:52.193 --> 13:53.974
You just can't.

13:53.994 --> 14:02.643
Let's make believe that Texas A&M hired you as a consultant today about geosciences in general and particularly oceanographer.

14:02.663 --> 14:03.985
What advice would you give them?

14:05.706 --> 14:12.053
Well, the thing I see is I would suggest to get further into the national picture.

14:12.674 --> 14:16.504
we get these professional magazines and you look at the different committees.

14:17.246 --> 14:20.194
How many committees has a representative from Texas A&M?

14:21.196 --> 14:27.012
And you look at the journals, how many in the year, how many articles are from Texas A&M?

14:27.713 --> 14:29.097
And I think,

14:30.393 --> 14:32.295
We might do a little better good.

14:32.736 --> 14:41.587
The question here maybe relates to a university publication, Quarterdeck, which is an excellent publication put out by Oceanography.

14:42.588 --> 14:44.611
There's a lot of effort required for that.

14:45.252 --> 14:54.343
And I can't help but wonder, and I've talked to the chairman about this previously, if that effort doesn't detract from the effort to get into the open literature.

14:55.564 --> 15:00.130
And if that effort is worthwhile, is the distribution list great enough?

15:00.194 --> 15:06.082
And does it do enough good to justify the amount of effort that goes into it?

15:06.923 --> 15:11.649
I know it's a beautiful publication, but it's all done here.

15:11.890 --> 15:16.476
And the whole publication business and library business is up for grabs now.

15:17.877 --> 15:29.593
Are there any newly emerging areas in oceanography that this department ought to take advantage of, ought to enter?

15:32.476 --> 15:36.902
I don't know of any new ones.

15:36.922 --> 15:40.667
There are a lot of old ones that have new aspects to them.

15:40.727 --> 15:44.772
Nuclear waste disposal, for example, what to do about this.

15:49.138 --> 15:52.343
Forecasting, that is where it gets tough.

15:53.164 --> 15:59.412
And the forecast and the weather over the ocean, like the hurricanes.

16:01.889 --> 16:05.497
Bill Gray at Colorado tries to forecast the number of hurricanes.

16:06.599 --> 16:14.075
I wrote, there are four papers that I'm proud of, one of which is called the Hurricane Heat Potential of the Ocean.

16:15.318 --> 16:18.565
And it turns out now they've found that that is a valuable way

16:19.034 --> 16:26.033
of predicting or helping predict the intensity and the track of hurricanes.

16:27.156 --> 16:32.250
And in the case of Hurricane Britt, which was just on the news a month ago,

16:33.428 --> 16:41.560
What they said was that the heat potential of the Western Gulf is what made Brett grow so fast and grow so large.

16:42.301 --> 16:49.372
And there's a group of four people now in the Weather Service in Miami who are continuing research on this study I turned out in 1976.

16:49.512 --> 16:51.135
It had been kind of quiescent.

16:51.155 --> 16:56.483
What it was, people have used the sea surface temperature to indicate the heat content.

16:56.503 --> 16:57.985
Well, that's only the skin.

16:58.454 --> 17:02.701
And what I said is, no, you have to use the three-dimensional volume of how much heat.

17:03.382 --> 17:09.232
And that has not been done until just the last three or four years at Dallas.

17:09.352 --> 17:17.125
I met this group of people who were finally finding that the total heat resource is what's important to hurricane development.

17:18.187 --> 17:20.331
So that was a satisfying.

17:20.351 --> 17:22.234
So I'd say forecasting.

17:22.332 --> 17:32.342
It's an area where people are kind of worried about getting into it, and you get your neck chopped off pretty quickly, but that is where the need is.

17:33.200 --> 17:35.262
And it's true in every aspect.

17:35.582 --> 17:38.705
In the fisheries, what are the populations of various kinds of fish?

17:39.486 --> 17:45.772
In the weather, what's the heat do to change the incoming weather on the coastlines?

17:46.553 --> 17:54.080
In the geology, forecasting, well, beach erosion, for example, that's a terrific problem nowadays.

17:54.941 --> 18:01.367
And we used to have an island down here that would grow on one end and erode on the other end.

18:02.562 --> 18:03.724
You had to know what you're doing.

18:04.004 --> 18:11.134
One of the first problems we ever had was down along the coast, is this land a part of Texas or is it part of the Gulf of Mexico?

18:11.834 --> 18:13.837
And it depended on which way the wind was blowing.

18:14.618 --> 18:22.068
So forecasting is an area of very great value and very difficult and very widespread.

18:23.050 --> 18:30.780
As far as you know nationally, how is the oceanography and the geosciences in general

18:31.283 --> 18:32.945
How are we rated here?

18:34.487 --> 18:36.469
Are we in the top?

18:36.489 --> 18:37.190
Texas A&M?

18:37.290 --> 18:40.414
Yes, sir.

18:40.434 --> 18:44.559
Well, the South has a little disadvantage.

18:44.599 --> 18:51.688
Somehow the Northeast, a lot of people over there think that that's an isolated part of the country.

18:54.368 --> 18:57.956
California is another specialized area.

18:58.618 --> 19:01.364
California's thrown a lot of support into oceanography.

19:04.111 --> 19:13.272
Hugh McClellan wrote a letter to the president in which he said he thought we were the third best in the country, almost certainly in the top five.

19:13.893 --> 19:15.055
And I think that's true.

19:15.135 --> 19:29.354
They've got a big series coming up where they're going to visit from campus to campus, and ours is one of the five campuses they're going to review for some kind of a major oceanographic overlook.

19:29.374 --> 19:34.862
So you'd say that we certainly are in the top 10, unquestionably.

19:35.202 --> 19:35.583
Oh, yes.

19:35.783 --> 19:37.265
And perhaps in the top five.

19:37.465 --> 19:41.851
The top five, that would be Woods Hole, Miami, and Scripps, University of Washington, and us.

19:42.693 --> 19:43.714
Very good company.

19:44.048 --> 19:50.080
Let's see, looking back on your years, what were your proudest moments as you now look back?

19:50.180 --> 19:56.533
You felt the greatest amount of pride about the accomplishments here when?

20:00.982 --> 20:01.062
Hmm.

20:02.358 --> 20:04.440
I don't remember any moment.

20:05.321 --> 20:10.407
I guess it's when they declared a new college and hired Dean Buyers as dean.

20:11.408 --> 20:18.296
Do you remember any key moments of frustration, disappointment?

20:19.317 --> 20:27.526
Yes, when I told Dean Hubert that I felt we'd been stymied for five years and got no answer.

20:29.248 --> 20:31.791
No answer.

20:32.902 --> 20:39.468
Let's see, do you remember any goofy, incredible events, whether they were important or not?

20:39.488 --> 20:39.689
Oh, yes.

20:39.849 --> 20:40.129
Yes, sure.

20:40.149 --> 20:41.470
Share some of those anecdotes.

20:42.511 --> 20:44.573
Well, we needed a ship in the beginning.

20:46.315 --> 20:47.436
ONR was sympathetic.

20:47.916 --> 20:52.081
ONR had written a specification of what a ship should be for oceanographic research.

20:52.961 --> 20:55.264
They called us up one day and said, we've got a ship for you.

20:56.605 --> 20:58.166
Come up and get it in North Carolina.

20:59.187 --> 21:00.248
We didn't have a crew.

21:00.589 --> 21:01.930
We didn't have a budget.

21:02.281 --> 21:03.865
But we got the ship.

21:03.885 --> 21:04.607
We brought it around.

21:04.687 --> 21:06.111
What it was was a harbor tug.

21:07.735 --> 21:11.485
Okay, I looked at it and we had it.

21:11.706 --> 21:12.869
I mean, it was brought down here.

21:12.889 --> 21:14.012
It was our ship.

21:14.465 --> 21:17.908
The inside was nothing but engine, nothing but engine.

21:18.609 --> 21:20.251
I looked for laboratory possibilities.

21:20.271 --> 21:24.034
The only possibility was on the bridge where the captain was, and there was hardly room for him.

21:25.596 --> 21:27.618
So, okay, it didn't look too good.

21:28.299 --> 21:38.028
We only went out one day, and just as we got outside into the open water, somebody shouted, man overboard.

21:40.871 --> 21:42.092
Jerry Stein jumped in.

21:43.068 --> 21:47.255
rescued the fellow, pulled him away from the propellers and saved him.

21:48.096 --> 21:49.078
That fellow couldn't swim.

21:49.779 --> 21:51.542
Somebody hollered, stop the engines.

21:53.165 --> 21:56.811
It was, couldn't stop the engine, it was the engineer that had fallen overboard.

21:58.073 --> 22:01.318
So Don Hood jumped in the water to help support him.

22:01.879 --> 22:03.843
Somehow he got turned around in the back pickup.

22:05.085 --> 22:08.350
But that was the only day we took the Albemarle of the sea.

22:08.330 --> 22:13.498
Within a month or so, the sister ship of Albemarle was working in the Gulf.

22:13.978 --> 22:15.160
I told you it was a harbor dog.

22:15.200 --> 22:18.184
Turned over and sank in three minutes.

22:20.928 --> 22:22.751
That was one incident I remember.

22:23.833 --> 22:28.900
And of course there are a number of other, I told you about the drill press we got from her.

22:29.781 --> 22:32.485
And I have a list of some of those things there.

22:36.070 --> 22:37.172
Let's see.

22:39.143 --> 22:50.240
You never had any break-ins, thievery, fires of great problems?

22:51.502 --> 22:53.625
No natural disasters of great problems?

22:56.009 --> 22:57.491
Well, no natural disasters.

22:57.571 --> 23:04.662
I remember once when we had a converted minesweeper for research and we were out in the Atlantic.

23:05.722 --> 23:13.970
near Bermuda, and the BT, which I mentioned is an instrument you lower over the side to measure temperature, and you do that as you go along.

23:15.271 --> 23:17.833
Well, the BT caught on a rock somehow.

23:18.694 --> 23:29.945
It tightened the wire and broke the wire, and the boom, which hold it, swung around and hit a man on the side of the head, and it was pretty serious.

23:30.605 --> 23:32.287
Tom Harrington's son was along.

23:32.347 --> 23:34.429
He was a pre-medical student.

23:34.409 --> 23:42.541
And he helped with the first aid, and we were within a half a mile of being ashore in Bermuda before there's a hospital.

23:43.562 --> 23:48.870
And I look back now and think, well, nowadays we'd be sued for something like that.

23:50.672 --> 23:58.203
As you recall, some of your own students, your graduate students, where are some of them now?

23:58.303 --> 24:00.366
Who are some that you're most proud to claim?

24:01.358 --> 24:06.828
Well, I usually took the ones that had some kind of a question with other sponsors.

24:08.070 --> 24:09.173
One was Don Walsh.

24:10.455 --> 24:12.759
I had a letter from him a week or so ago.

24:14.082 --> 24:19.131
He was the fellow who went to the bottom of the ocean in the bathyscap long ago.

24:19.111 --> 24:29.447
If he were offered a scholarship of just a couple hundred dollars, the Navy would support his entire program, and he came for a master's and for a doctor's, and he got that.

24:29.467 --> 24:44.511
He is still a consultant in international affairs, and right this week he's working in the Azores, and he's diving in a Russian manned submersible and working at depths of 2,500 meters.

24:44.491 --> 24:48.157
So he was one of the unusual students that I accepted.

24:49.399 --> 24:50.902
Archie Kahan was another one.

24:50.962 --> 24:58.334
Archie just wasn't too much interested in academic work, but a degree would be very useful to him as administrator.

24:58.414 --> 25:01.840
So we worked out something and he got his degree.

25:01.900 --> 25:09.553
The ones I'm most proud of, I think,

25:11.440 --> 25:15.484
Jim O'Brien actually wasn't my student, but I gave him my first scholarship.

25:16.765 --> 25:18.387
He came from New York.

25:19.668 --> 25:21.190
I took him on his first cruise.

25:22.531 --> 25:27.156
I gave him a research topic, which he blew into an international long-term fare.

25:27.336 --> 25:35.344
And now he's probably the top, one of the top two or three oceanographers, meteorologist combination in the country.

25:35.384 --> 25:40.249
He was quoted this month in the Washington Post, quoted in Time Magazine that just came out.

25:40.685 --> 25:46.373
authority on the El Nino, La Nina, and Hurricanes, Hurricanes development.

25:47.374 --> 25:54.945
So he got his degree under Bob Reed, but I feel a contribution to him and get him on the right road.

25:56.267 --> 26:03.356
And I also feel a contribution to Bob Reed because it allowed him to get in a spot where he could really make use of his capabilities.

26:03.837 --> 26:08.143
Scripps said he should stay at Scripps because they had big piles of data there for him to work on.

26:08.630 --> 26:11.353
Bob Reed did not want big piles of data.

26:12.455 --> 26:15.238
He wanted to work with people and data.

26:16.440 --> 26:25.070
So, yes, I look back all like Warren Thompson, one of our first graduates with a PhD, geological oceanographer.

26:25.090 --> 26:33.861
He's been a friend over the years, became professor at the Naval Postgraduate School, consultant to the state of California on erosion and beach problems.

26:35.039 --> 26:43.090
Charlie Bates, I think of these more as peers rather than students, but we did give them degrees.

26:44.151 --> 26:47.676
Charlie was director of the hydrographic office, civil service.

26:47.696 --> 26:51.160
He was chief scientist of the Coast Guard, wrote several good books.

26:51.501 --> 26:53.123
Maybe I've said that before, I don't know.

26:53.543 --> 27:00.372
Graduated in 1953 very early because they had such good backgrounds to start with, both of them.

27:01.554 --> 27:03.797
And then in meteorology,

27:04.385 --> 27:05.728
Well, let's take engineering.

27:06.850 --> 27:15.327
One thing I'm really proud of is that I gave a talk to the graduating class of engineers, banquet.

27:15.347 --> 27:16.870
Afterwards, a couple of fellows came up.

27:17.912 --> 27:21.900
One was Roy Gall, who was a straight-A student in civil engineering.

27:22.561 --> 27:24.385
He came into oceanography and got a doctorate.

27:24.972 --> 27:30.257
Another was Randy Bloomberg was a straight-A student in electrical engineering, and he came over and got his doctor.

27:31.078 --> 27:37.544
Roy Gall became chief advisor in anti-submarine warfare to the admiral that was running that area.

27:39.025 --> 27:45.631
Randy Bloomberg became a consultant in Houston and was killed in an auto accident some years ago.

27:46.552 --> 27:48.514
So those are some of the things I remember.

27:50.896 --> 27:53.038
Let's see, one of the things I want to be sure and mention

27:53.828 --> 28:09.711
If you have any papers, accumulation of materials, letters, journals, diaries that you ever want to share, please share them with the A&M archives.

28:10.132 --> 28:12.816
I'm glad you said that because I've wondered about this.

28:13.136 --> 28:16.501
I've sort of tested different individuals you notice where they might go.

28:16.701 --> 28:18.764
See, that would be a central place.

28:19.425 --> 28:20.407
They have the staffing.

28:20.928 --> 28:22.570
They have the temperature controls.

28:23.208 --> 28:33.819
and they also have the appropriate services to protect them and to keep them in good order.

28:34.260 --> 28:41.167
And they would arrange them so that they would be most useful to anyone who might want to use them.

28:42.609 --> 28:44.991
So please think of that.

28:46.333 --> 28:48.355
Then let me ask you this question.

28:48.790 --> 28:49.751
goofy question.

28:50.312 --> 28:57.022
Let's make believe that someone gives you a check for one million dollars and there's only one condition.

28:57.883 --> 29:02.850
You must pass that on to Texas A&M, but you get to decide what's to be done with it.

29:04.393 --> 29:10.922
If you had a million dollars that you could give to A&M, what would you want them, what use would you want them to make of that gift?

29:13.025 --> 29:13.566
Well,

29:15.115 --> 29:19.725
That's kind of a difficult decision, but I think what I would do is

29:21.157 --> 29:25.584
make it possible for somebody to use good judgment and how to spend that.

29:26.205 --> 29:36.542
I would not want to tie it up in a single fellowship program or a chair or anything else, but the thing that's missing is flexibility.

29:37.484 --> 29:45.797
Everything you get, you have to write a lot of proposals for and you have to go by a lot of rules to outspend and you're kind of restricted with what you can do.

29:46.351 --> 29:53.839
But like I mentioned, the $5,000 for miscellaneous travel, that was worth more than thousands of other dollars.

29:55.040 --> 30:04.030
It's always amazed me that through the years I could never get $5,000 from the legislature to sponsor thinking.

30:05.392 --> 30:11.999
And here I might say that we did not have an experiment station.

30:12.099 --> 30:15.683
Engineering had an experiment station where they could hire people as researchers.

30:16.051 --> 30:17.854
Agriculture had an experiment station.

30:17.994 --> 30:19.436
Arts and Sciences did not have.

30:20.197 --> 30:26.306
So it was very difficult then to do entrepreneurial type of things.

30:27.968 --> 30:37.963
So I would leave this to the judgment of the dean and the department head who were running the program, pretty much.

30:38.543 --> 30:44.472
I might say, well, I'd like to favor an increase in this Sierra Interaction type of thing.

30:44.907 --> 30:51.679
It's a shame now actually that meteorology, best I can see, has very few people who are studying oceanography.

30:51.699 --> 30:58.571
There was a time when many of the master's graduates in meteorology would come and get their doctorate in oceanography, physical.

30:59.032 --> 31:01.937
That was pretty much because of Professor Reed.

31:02.558 --> 31:03.860
not teaching much anymore.

31:03.920 --> 31:05.582
This may be part of the problem.

31:06.303 --> 31:13.173
But there are a couple of professors in oceanography that could take a meteorologist and do a good thing with him in the joint fields.

31:14.354 --> 31:21.825
So the flexibility, you can't get, that's very hard to get money without too many strings attached.

31:23.147 --> 31:31.198
And I would just point out some directions that would be interested in seeing it encourage and let the department decide how to do it.

31:32.123 --> 31:34.068
I'm looking at my notes and your notes.

31:34.128 --> 31:35.150
What have we omitted?

31:35.992 --> 31:40.202
What do you recall that we should have been talking about that we've not yet covered?

31:42.186 --> 31:44.893
Well, we've done very well and covered a lot of subjects.

31:47.459 --> 31:51.027
Of course, 15 years is a long time, and there are a lot of things going on.
