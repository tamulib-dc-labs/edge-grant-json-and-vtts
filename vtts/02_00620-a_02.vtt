WEBVTT

00:11.658 --> 00:18.386
a consultant or a reviewer for proposals or a 
member of an ad hoc panel, something like that. But

00:18.406 --> 00:21.730
I've never actually worked for NSF.

00:29.259 --> 00:29.459
No. Okay. What about the political goals of IDOE?

00:39.731 --> 00:40.652
Oh, that's a hard one. I think there must have been 
several, and I'm inferring a lot of it, but you will

00:42.691 --> 00:56.187
remember that it was, the whole theme was 
suggested by, I guess, Vice President Humphrey.

00:56.207 --> 01:03.757
And it was initiated at a time when funding for 
research was beginning to slip. And there was a

01:06.079 --> 01:09.964
general dampening of the role that science and 
technology were playing in society. There was

01:18.883 --> 01:26.270
also an awareness on the part of some number of 
people that we were going to get into trouble on

01:18.883 --> 01:26.270
things like Law of the Sea. And I think, I don't know 
this, but I assume that some of the motivation here

01:27.752 --> 01:39.343
was to try to bring together the scientific 
communities of the various countries, including

01:27.752 --> 01:39.343
the developing countries. and emphasize what can 
be achieved by a common coordinated effort with

01:40.252 --> 01:51.664
some cooperative research programs like this big 
upwelling program. Now, there may have been a

01:53.647 --> 01:58.772
variety of other political motives that I will 
never know about. I'm sure there were, but I don't,

01:58.792 --> 02:01.956
I can't speak to them. Well, how does, how does 
biological oceanography fit into the IDOE

02:03.097 --> 02:07.862
program?

02:11.960 --> 02:39.486
Well, in several of the subsections, living 
resources primarily, but also in environmental

02:11.960 --> 02:39.486
quality, there are biological programs designed 
either to give us some feel for the problems of

02:11.960 --> 02:39.486
coastal pollution, oceanic pollution, plus in 
the living resources program, the whole theme,

02:11.960 --> 02:39.486
well, no, not the whole theme, But the primary 
program there is CUEA, Coastal Upwelling, which

02:40.124 --> 03:01.145
I'm sure you're aware is designed to determine the 
role of the deeper nutrient-rich waters in

02:40.124 --> 03:01.145
contributing to growth of phytoplankton, 
zooplankton, fish, and then turning it into a

02:40.124 --> 03:01.145
natural resource. But other than that, many of the 
programs are physical, chemical, geological. Is

03:09.622 --> 03:13.849
the IDOE truly an international venture?

03:18.696 --> 03:24.625
It may now have evolved into an international 
venture, but I think it's stretching it. If you

03:26.428 --> 03:35.562
look at the reports from IDOE,

03:26.428 --> 03:35.562
you will see some number of institutions

03:37.803 --> 03:42.289
representing some number of countries that are 
involved in various programs. And in that sense it

03:43.310 --> 03:45.092
is international. Now it did not even, it evolved 
that way though. It didn't start out that way. Even

03:51.040 --> 03:53.723
though the I in IDOE has always been there. It took a 
number of years for other scientists from other

03:53.763 --> 04:04.637
countries to convince their own governments that 
they should be involved and to get the funding to be

03:53.763 --> 04:04.637
involved and So it is now, yeah. And more or less, 
depending on the program itself, there are some

04:08.693 --> 04:13.499
that are strictly international. The Quay 
program is very strongly internationally

04:13.559 --> 04:20.868
oriented.

04:25.274 --> 04:31.902
As a scientist, if I may ask this broad question, 
I'll find AOE. What is your opinion of pollution of

04:33.224 --> 04:36.328
the coastal waters? Do you see this as an immediate 
danger? You see the ocean is able to absorb more

04:40.776 --> 04:44.360
waste?

04:48.545 --> 04:55.713
In spite of what Cousteau says, the ocean can 
absorb more waste, but to me that's not the

04:48.545 --> 04:55.713
problem. The most productive area of the ocean in 
terms of man and resources is the coastal area and

04:56.574 --> 05:05.725
the estuarine area. If you continue to dump just 
about everything that you don't want into that

05:06.076 --> 05:14.308
area, sure, in time, the ocean will absorb it. But 
in so doing, it will destroy some number of the

05:14.608 --> 05:20.396
natural resources on which we depend. In this 
state, it's a perfect example. In 1920, there was

05:23.681 --> 05:33.535
something like 5,000 acres of shell fishing 
waters prohibited or closed because of

05:23.681 --> 05:33.535
pollution. In 1975, it was just under 800,000 
acres. And how many more hundreds of thousands of

05:39.940 --> 05:48.332
acres can we afford to close before we don't have 
any shell fishing or shrimp or anything else? And

05:48.352 --> 05:53.420
it'll just move out into the offshore waters if we 
continue to do it.

05:57.226 --> 06:01.292
Do you favor, in effect, governmental 
interference? I favor... correcting the

06:03.755 --> 06:14.971
situation, and since private individuals and 
industries do not seem capable of doing it

06:03.755 --> 06:14.971
themselves, we have no recourse but to fall back on 
the government. Now, do you see any future for such

06:17.455 --> 06:23.904
things as aquaculture in marine coastal waters? 
Well, unfortunately, the word has been so misused

06:26.087 --> 06:31.855
by the politicians and in part by some sections of 
the scientific community. Originally, there

06:37.473 --> 06:43.539
were those who said that this would be a method by 
which we could feed the starving millions of the

06:37.473 --> 06:43.539
world. And it was on that theme that the 
politicians sold it. And now, it has not done that,

06:47.763 --> 06:52.628
and it will not do that. The Japanese have been 
quite successful in culturing shrimp, but the

06:53.849 --> 06:59.395
price of shrimp make it strictly an affluent diet. 
And people have ventured into this without very

07:04.652 --> 07:20.074
sound scientific approaches, and many of the 
efforts, even on the part of private

07:04.652 --> 07:20.074
corporations, have been disastrous because they 
didn't lay the foundation. They were in such a

07:20.094 --> 07:24.040
hurry to make the quick buck. With good planning 
and sensible arrangement of

07:32.433 --> 07:43.144
species that can be cultured, should be cultured, 
I think it could be a very profitable industry, but

07:32.433 --> 07:43.144
it will never feed the starving millions of the 
world. Now as an expert on crustaceans, do you see

07:43.164 --> 07:53.855
possibly your future role in oceanography is 
involved in some kind of aquaculture? Not really.

07:58.252 --> 08:17.191
I see my role continuing much as it has been to 
provide the basic understanding of development

07:58.252 --> 08:17.191
of crustaceans, the techniques for culturing 
them under laboratory conditions to determine

07:58.252 --> 08:17.191
what environmental parameters contribute to 
survival and good development. And then it's up to

08:18.052 --> 08:27.702
a second group to take it and develop this into a 
pilot commercial venture on a scale big enough to

08:18.052 --> 08:27.702
make it worthwhile. then presumably a third group 
private enterprise to pick it up and make it pay but

08:28.002 --> 08:56.895
it's not my role as a professor at duke university 
to do it for a private industry all right do you uh

08:28.002 --> 08:56.895
then possibly feel that that the move towards 
mission-oriented research with such people as

08:28.002 --> 08:56.895
onr and to a lesser extent with nsf do you do you feel 
that that uh will discourage work such as yours,

08:57.230 --> 09:01.676
which is not mission oriented. It already has made 
it far more difficult for people to obtain support

09:01.696 --> 09:08.325
for basic research. And the irony of it, which I 
conveyed to Senator Weikert several months ago,

09:08.345 --> 09:25.347
is that while in the realm of oceanography we are 
being told to slant our research more and more

09:08.345 --> 09:25.347
toward applied work, we're spending billions to 
determine if there is life on Mars. Well, isn't

09:26.390 --> 09:27.732
that basic? There's no possible application. 
There's an awful lot of inconsistency here.

09:37.923 --> 09:49.676
Besides Senator Weicker, Senator Humphrey, for 
example, is well known for his concept of basic

09:37.923 --> 09:49.676
research in oceanography and his support of 
oceanographic institutions. Can you think of any

09:50.277 --> 09:55.823
other senators or congressmen, other than your 
own state, who have been sympathetic? Well, I

09:56.663 --> 09:58.185
wouldn't include my own state. I don't know that my 
two senators would know the meaning of the word.

10:02.971 --> 10:05.313
You can put that on the record. Senator Magnuson 
has been for, I don't know, 20 years, I think, one of

10:05.794 --> 10:16.987
the better known senators relative to 
oceanography. Senator Pell, Rhode Island, who

10:18.049 --> 10:22.674
conceived the Sea Grant Program. Senator 
Hollings from South Carolina. Those are the three

10:28.321 --> 10:32.225
names that really come to mind immediately in the 
Senate.

10:36.370 --> 10:43.578
And there may be others, but they

10:36.370 --> 10:43.578
have not played the role that those three have. And 
Weikert, of course, is trying, but he's a

10:45.981 --> 10:49.505
relatively junior senator.

10:52.709 --> 10:58.075
Now, how does the National Academy of Science 
contribute to the Oceanographic Institute?

11:00.080 --> 11:08.989
Well, that's a good one.

11:09.009 --> 11:27.167
Well, they do a number of things, such as reviews of 
programs, which hopefully influence the

11:09.009 --> 11:27.167
Congress and the government executive as to 
trends in science, things that need to be done,

11:09.009 --> 11:27.167
things that need to be corrected.

11:31.822 --> 11:43.073
And they encourage the

11:31.822 --> 11:43.073
open discussion of areas that need to be looked at. 
And, of course, in the realm of international

11:43.093 --> 11:51.321
science, they, I guess, play a major role. 
Unfortunately, with the Soviet Union, this has

11:51.621 --> 11:55.985
not evolved properly. But other than that, they 
do. Now, would you elaborate some of that

11:58.535 --> 12:01.178
statement, please? I'm not sure I understand it in 
terms of the Soviet Union. Well, in 73, you may

12:03.880 --> 12:15.292
remember that ex-President Nixon and Mr. Bryson 
have signed a number of agreements for

12:03.880 --> 12:15.292
cooperative research programs. One of them is in 
the realm of oceanography, entitled Biological

12:15.312 --> 12:25.842
Productivity and Biochemistry of the World's 
Oceans, a typical Russian title. Somehow,

12:27.577 --> 12:37.327
within the organizational scheme, NOAA emerged 
as the lead agency. And in the working group that

12:39.809 --> 12:50.340
was pulled together to coordinate the thing, you 
have representation from NOAA, NSF, ONR, and

12:39.809 --> 12:50.340
academia. But at no point is the academy involved. 
And the sad part of it is that the Academy has

12:54.796 --> 13:03.126
tremendous experience, more than any of the other 
ones put together in the realm of international

12:54.796 --> 13:03.126
science.

13:06.690 --> 13:13.157
The Soviet version of the working groups works 
through the Academy of the Soviet Union. And you

13:13.878 --> 13:22.508
can tell from discussions with the Soviet 
scientists that they don't understand why it is

13:13.878 --> 13:22.508
that the Academy has been ignored. Normally it's 
an academy-academy relationship. But here they

13:27.029 --> 13:35.779
find themselves talking from the side of the 
Soviet Academy to a bunch of government agencies.

13:35.999 --> 13:37.100
Well, what happened to the Academy? And I've 
written to Phil Handler about it, and he, I think,

13:38.722 --> 13:50.554
agrees that the Academy could play a very 
effective role in all of this, but they've just

13:38.722 --> 13:50.554
been completely left out. What types of research 
in marine biology did the NSF tend to encourage or

13:53.116 --> 13:59.506
tend to favor? You said did or? Does. Does. I don't 
know that they encourage or favor any of it

14:05.136 --> 14:08.621
actively.

14:14.050 --> 14:20.220
At least on paper, a person can submit a proposal 
directly to NSF. where it is shunted into some

14:21.247 --> 14:30.615
appropriate subsection, where it is presumably 
reviewed by your peers. And if it is meritorious on

14:32.257 --> 14:45.028
original research, you have a reasonable chance 
of getting some funding, usually not what you ask

14:32.257 --> 14:45.028
for, but some. But I don't know that with the 
exception of IDOE, that NSF has ever encouraged a

14:50.693 --> 15:03.669
particular line of research, as opposed to IRDA, 
ONR, EPA, where they know the areas in which they

14:50.693 --> 15:03.669
wish to support research. And if yours falls 
within that area, fine. If it doesn't fall within

15:05.611 --> 15:08.294
that area, they return the proposal.

15:11.098 --> 15:15.463
Then you would say about the National Academy of 
Sciences then, I suppose, the same thing? They've

15:15.663 --> 15:17.926
tended not to favor a particular kind of research? 
Oh, they don't. Right. And of course, they don't

15:19.887 --> 15:21.509
fund any research. That's right. I was wondering 
in passing judgments on proposals. I'm not aware

15:25.974 --> 15:28.837
that they even pass judgment on proposals. I would 
never send a proposal for research support to the

15:30.659 --> 15:33.742
academy. I would get it back within three days, 
saying that this is not their function. I have

15:39.909 --> 15:41.591
phrased that poorly. In offering advice to 
sciences, have they tended to favor one

15:42.071 --> 15:48.058
particular? No. No. They may in, well, okay, here 
is a academy document, which I was involved with,

15:52.030 --> 16:03.287
biological oceanography, some critical issues, 
problems, and recommendations. Okay, this is an

16:03.307 --> 16:18.629
official publication of the academy brought 
together by a group of U.S. scientists

16:03.307 --> 16:18.629
recommending that certain areas should be 
considered emphasized or de-emphasized. And To

16:19.810 --> 16:24.695
that extent, the academy does provide some 
guidance, but that's all. Now, do you see any

16:25.616 --> 16:36.148
trends in terms of research and courage now, or 
approaches in oceanography that have changed the

16:25.616 --> 16:36.148
nature of the discipline in the last several years 
or so? Yeah, primarily in the form of IDOE. We are

16:41.534 --> 16:46.459
very possibly at a threshold. where there will be a 
good deal of discussion about managed research,

16:48.498 --> 17:01.117
big research teams, as opposed to the individual 
who sits in his ivory tower and thinks. And I will

17:02.779 --> 17:15.518
not be at all surprised if in the next five years we 
hear more and more about the merits of managed

17:02.779 --> 17:15.518
research and research teams versus individual 
research. Do you approve of managed research and

17:17.827 --> 17:20.330
research teams?

17:23.754 --> 17:29.560
Well, there are certain problems which can only be 
resolved through large-scale efforts. And any

17:30.381 --> 17:36.028
time you get a large-scale effort, somebody 
better manage it. Now, let me approach that

17:36.048 --> 17:39.672
question from a different way. I have heard 
several of your colleagues complain about

17:40.353 --> 17:45.218
project funding. maintaining that they liked it 
better when a lump sum was given to an institution

17:45.907 --> 18:03.179
like Scripps Institution of Oceanography or 
Texas A&M Department of Oceanography, and then it

17:45.907 --> 18:03.179
was parceled out from that institution really to 
encourage individual research within the

17:45.907 --> 18:03.179
institution. Would you agree with that 
assessment? I'm totally opposed to it,

18:06.425 --> 18:09.771
primarily. because this is the system that has 
been in effect for years in most European

18:11.422 --> 18:19.550
institutions. And it assumes that the professor, 
or whoever it happens to be that has the control

18:19.570 --> 18:39.690
over that pot of money, is totally objective, 
totally unbiased, and is sufficiently well

18:19.570 --> 18:39.690
informed on all realms of science that he can 
decide where the emphasis in terms of support

18:19.570 --> 18:39.690
should be placed. And all those assumptions are 
usually incorrect. If you do it the way NSF has done

18:43.983 --> 19:04.328
it for 25 years,

18:43.983 --> 19:04.328
an individual who has a good idea but may be out of 
favor with his boss that week still gets a fair

18:43.983 --> 19:04.328
hearing through his peers who are in a position to 
have a far better overview of science than one man.

19:06.164 --> 19:12.694
So that the block funding for certain things, like 
the operation of research vessels, that's fine.

19:12.714 --> 19:20.626
But to promote, encourage, and fund research, 
it's disastrous.

19:20.646 --> 19:32.644
Now, I want to move away now from specific 
questions about grant giving agencies or

19:20.646 --> 19:32.644
overseeing agencies and move into, if I could, the 
military. Why is NATO becoming involved in

19:33.367 --> 19:36.830
environmental studies?

19:42.476 --> 19:44.198
I assume because it's the thing to do. What is your 
role with these environmental studies? Well, I'm

19:50.344 --> 19:51.945
no longer involved with NATO. Right. I know you're 
not, but what was your role then and... Well, I

19:52.546 --> 19:56.089
never really... I wasn't with them long enough to 
find out because I got fired. Oh, how did... Within

20:02.864 --> 20:13.976
the first year of my appointment to that 
subcommittee, some number of meetings were

20:02.864 --> 20:13.976
scheduled and rescheduled and canceled and 
rescheduled and recanceled. And without really

20:14.977 --> 20:21.964
realizing it, I wound up attending, I guess, one of 
four. Shortly thereafter, I received a very

20:22.785 --> 20:31.774
official letter indicating that according to 
section 2B, subsection 4, 7, and so forth, Anyone

20:32.395 --> 20:39.546
who did not participate in more than two meetings 
in any one year was relieved of his position. I

20:40.106 --> 20:57.272
wrote back and told him that anyone who ran the show 
the way they did was expecting an awful lot from a

20:40.106 --> 20:57.272
scientist who had anything else to do to be able to 
drop everything he was doing tomorrow and come to

20:40.106 --> 20:57.272
Brussels, and that they had never appraised me of 
my rights before they appointed me. But I decided

20:58.282 --> 21:00.745
there wasn't any point in making any issue of it. 
They can run their show the way they want to, and

21:00.765 --> 21:05.512
I'll run mine the way I want to. So I don't have any 
real overview of what the NATO environmental

21:05.532 --> 21:12.621
program is, should be, or otherwise. Okay. Then I 
should like to approach the question in terms of

21:14.964 --> 21:19.871
international experience. Is environmental 
concerns or environmental concerns becoming

21:20.251 --> 21:25.819
important internationally? Oh, undoubtedly. 
Okay. Are they being discussed at international

21:28.133 --> 21:32.558
meetings with regularity? Definitely.

21:36.562 --> 21:42.688
Is there any consensus on an environmental 
approach to the oceans?

21:46.973 --> 21:52.298
Well, I think at the level of theory, there is a 
great deal of consensus. Where you get in trouble

21:54.280 --> 21:57.043
is that Beyond the theory, you get involved in what 
is practical, what is politically feasible. And

22:04.848 --> 22:19.787
even though a scientist from, say, a developing 
country feels that in theory his government is not

22:04.848 --> 22:19.787
devoting the time and attention and support to 
environmental concern, he has very little

22:04.848 --> 22:19.787
control over it. When he goes home, he may be told to 
shut up.

22:25.205 --> 22:34.915
There is definitely concern, and we're beginning 
to see the development of things like a

22:25.205 --> 22:34.915
Mediterranean pollution program, a Red Sea 
pollution program. Now, these are not very large

22:35.896 --> 22:39.320
oceans, admittedly, but it's a start. What 
threats are considered the most imminent threats

22:41.702 --> 22:46.628
to the ocean internationally? Well, I think 
petroleum is top of the list. Now, radioisotopes.

22:55.141 --> 22:59.327
long ago were recognized as being a real common 
threat. And it's one of the examples in the

23:00.249 --> 23:09.723
development of the nuclear age that I think we tend 
to forget about before they ever got to be a threat.

23:09.743 --> 23:22.262
The scientific communities and governments of 
the participating countries got together and did

23:09.743 --> 23:22.262
a very good job of making certain that there were 
established techniques and procedures to do

23:22.951 --> 23:33.444
everything possible to reduce the chances of a 
real spill which would contaminate for thousands

23:22.951 --> 23:33.444
of years some of the ocean. So it can be done. Now, I 
have three questions I already have written out

23:35.587 --> 23:42.636
concerning those exact two ideas, all right? 
First of all, what is your opinion of offshore

23:42.656 --> 23:45.560
drilling? It's obviously going to occur. Do we 
need more controls, less controls? Is it safe

23:49.705 --> 23:50.646
enough?

23:54.068 --> 23:59.515
Like everything else that man does, there is a 
calculated risk. And the best we can hope for is

24:01.378 --> 24:12.472
that if within that percent of error, when that 
percent of error shows up, which it's bound to,

24:01.378 --> 24:12.472
that we are properly informed as to how to deal with 
it. And that's where science comes into the

24:12.492 --> 24:14.755
picture. But there's absolutely nothing we are 
going to do to interfere with it. It's like this BLM

24:19.201 --> 24:20.903
fiasco.

24:26.063 --> 24:28.808
And nuclear plants then? Same way. Same way. Does 
it, do you feel uneasy as a scientist when

24:30.731 --> 24:39.386
referendums are asked on such things as nuclear 
plants and offshore drilling? Well, in

24:39.406 --> 24:41.670
democracy, I guess it's the only way to go. But the 
vast majority of people who are voting, including

24:42.471 --> 24:48.021
myself, are not well enough informed on the 
technology and the science to make a good

24:49.452 --> 24:56.662
objective decision. It's all too frequently a gut 
decision. And I was very surprised that the

24:59.947 --> 25:04.713
California referendum came out the way it did. It 
suggests that more people than we admit accept the

25:04.733 --> 25:11.583
fact that there is only so much energy. And when 
we've used it up, we're going to have to go

25:12.043 --> 25:17.451
someplace else. which, as a matter of fact, leads 
me to the third question. I have inferred from what

25:19.965 --> 25:31.423
you've said, and I mean to imply it, that you think 
nuclear plants are a viable alternative for

25:19.965 --> 25:31.423
states like North Carolina and so forth around the 
seas. What about nuclear waste? Do you have any

25:33.105 --> 25:39.014
opinions on that, since that's one of those things 
discussed internationally? Well, my only

25:39.034 --> 25:44.923
opinion would be strictly that, that it will 
undoubtedly pose a threat And the science and

25:46.456 --> 25:52.483
technology that's involved has a real problem. 
They're going to have to find how to deal with it.

25:55.206 --> 25:59.410
But I guess I have sufficient faith in science and 
technology to think that they will. And if we do

26:00.231 --> 26:11.704
with it what we have done with other things 
intelligently, we will find a very productive use

26:00.231 --> 26:11.704
for it.

26:12.562 --> 26:18.831
How closely are the United States and Soviet Union 
working together in oceanography today? We are

26:21.174 --> 26:33.612
beginning to work, I think, quite well within the 
constraints that are imposed upon us by politics.

26:34.714 --> 26:41.303
In the program that I'm involved in, as an example, 
we have met as a group twice, once in Moscow in

26:42.464 --> 26:56.964
December of 74, once here at Beaufort in May of 76, 
and we're scheduled to go to meet in Moscow in

26:42.464 --> 26:56.964
January of 77. And you can already see the 
beginnings of freer discussions between the

26:58.266 --> 27:07.358
Soviet scientists and the US scientists. And I am 
constantly reminding some of my more skeptical

27:08.806 --> 27:17.601
colleagues that they forget that these two 
communities have not talked to each other in 50

27:08.806 --> 27:17.601
years. And you cannot gauge the success of the 
U.S.-Soviet venture as if it were a similar

27:18.923 --> 27:30.502
program between Great Britain and the United 
States, where we've been talking since the

27:18.923 --> 27:30.502
Revolution. But I am encouraged by the way it's 
beginning to develop.

27:37.898 --> 27:40.180
What sort of things are you talking about 
internationally? Voyages? Well, in this

27:42.643 --> 28:00.322
biological productivity program, we started out 
with the traditional document which outlined

27:42.643 --> 28:00.322
some number of general broad areas where we feel 
cooperation would be possible and useful to both

27:42.643 --> 28:00.322
countries. Then, within these seven or eight 
subsections, Individual scientists are

28:07.177 --> 28:14.325
developing in greater detail the provisions for a 
number of things, the exchange of scientists.

28:15.226 --> 28:21.754
First, the idea being you've got to get to know the 
other guy if you're going to plan any sort of a

28:15.226 --> 28:21.754
cooperative research program. Exchange in terms 
of not just a week or so, but for a longer period of

28:22.695 --> 28:32.526
time so that U.S. scientists can work in Soviet 
laboratories, Soviet scientists can work in U.S.

28:22.695 --> 28:32.526
laboratories.
