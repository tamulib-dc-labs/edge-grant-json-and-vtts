WEBVTT

00:01.988 --> 00:05.013
which was a pilot in Vietnam. And what was your date 
of birth? September 17th, 1944. Okay, and you were

00:09.419 --> 00:11.021
a pilot. Okay, what we're doing is going to begin an 
interview concerning the war in Vietnam that he is

00:12.964 --> 00:20.115
a veteran of. Okay, the first kind of question, and 
of course you can stop me and go anywhere you like,

00:20.973 --> 00:31.224
is I'd first like to know about your life prior to 
Vietnam. What were your plans before Vietnam, and

00:31.865 --> 00:37.531
what would you have been doing at that time if 
Vietnam did not occur? My dad was career military.

00:41.936 --> 00:46.761
He was in the Signal Corps and retired in 1964 as 
Lieutenant Colonel. I went to the University of

00:47.753 --> 00:50.596
Texas at El Paso. It was Texas Western, then it 
became UT El Paso, and was in ROTC and completed my

00:50.616 --> 01:04.510
ROTC requirements prior, about a year prior to 
graduation. And it was because there was a high

01:04.530 --> 01:09.656
demand for officers and pilots. They offered me a 
commission prior to graduation, which

01:09.936 --> 01:16.663
fortunately I declined and went ahead and 
finished my degree. At the same time that they were

01:17.453 --> 01:41.554
offering me the commission, I got married in 
November of 66, graduated in January of 68,

01:17.453 --> 01:41.554
and had

01:17.453 --> 01:41.554
to report in April of 68 to Fort Gordon, Georgia, 
because I had chosen my basic branch, Signal

01:41.973 --> 01:45.077
Corps. The Army at that time did not have an 
aviation branch. They needed you to have a basic

01:48.482 --> 01:54.291
branch, and I chose Signal Corps because that's 
what my dad was in and that's what I knew.

01:58.437 --> 02:06.428
We went to California for a couple of months until 
it was time to report and worked at Greyhound. in

02:06.779 --> 02:13.649
the bagging department, making more money than I 
made as a second lieutenant when I reported for

02:06.779 --> 02:13.649
active duty. But we went to Fort Gordon. I was there 
from April until the end of July. And in August,

02:21.982 --> 02:33.679
actually end of July, first of August, I reported 
to Fort Stewart, Georgia for the first phase of

02:21.982 --> 02:33.679
flight school. And I was initial entry fixed wing 
which meant airplanes as opposed to helicopters.

02:38.577 --> 02:42.042
Helicopters are rotary wings. That's how we refer 
to those. The first phase of flight school was four

02:44.425 --> 03:01.369
months in Fort Stewart, learning how to fly T-41s, 
their little Cessna 182s, high-wing fixed-gear

02:44.425 --> 03:01.369
aircraft. And then we went to Fort Rucker, 
Alabama, In December, for the second four months

03:05.740 --> 03:11.706
of flight school, we had a little break in between. 
And there I learned to fly the T-42, which is a beach

03:12.727 --> 03:17.792
baron for instrument training. And then the bird 
dog, which is also a Cessna high-wing observation

03:17.812 --> 03:22.716
plane. Are you familiar with the bird dog? A little 
bit. Okay. Pilot sits in the front. Observer or

03:27.281 --> 03:29.523
instructor sits in the back. Tail wheel. And we 
learned how to operate that in what they call a

03:31.985 --> 03:34.768
tactical plane. means and tactical method. A lot 
of low level flying, a lot of short field. So more of

03:42.746 --> 03:44.448
a combat. More of a preparing us for what they 
thought we would do in Vietnam. Turns out it wasn't

03:49.716 --> 03:51.619
that much. We would practice firing artillery and 
things like that. The artillery was the only thing

03:58.449 --> 04:03.777
that they taught us in that phase that was really 
useful.

04:05.444 --> 04:17.680
But that's basically the way the training went 
until May of 69, end of April, actually, first of

04:05.444 --> 04:17.680
May. And you get a little leave, and we went to 
California to see my parents. They live in Los

04:23.407 --> 04:24.308
Angeles. And then in early May, I left for Vietnam 
out of San Francisco. In 69? In 69. Now, that is

04:35.633 --> 04:42.360
where I'll leave off for a moment en route to 
Vietnam. You asked what I would be doing if I hadn't

04:42.440 --> 04:44.943
gone there. It never entered my mind that I would 
not go. Oh, really? I had planned on being in the

04:49.648 --> 04:53.092
military from before I entered college. Spending 
some time, I didn't know if I was going to make it a

04:54.453 --> 04:59.619
career or not, but I planned on spending some time 
in the military. I planned early on to take ROTC,

05:03.764 --> 05:18.939
and since Vietnam was going on before I entered, or 
about the time I entered college, they were

05:03.764 --> 05:18.939
starting to build up and stuff like that, it just 
seemed logical that I would go over there. There

05:18.979 --> 05:25.105
was no concern or anticipation or anything 
special. I just accepted that I would serve and

05:30.410 --> 05:35.417
high probability that that's where I would serve, 
one of the places I would serve, so it was no big

05:30.410 --> 05:35.417
deal. What was your age when you... Let's see, when 
I went in the Army in 68, I turned 24

05:36.378 --> 05:54.183
in September of 68, so I was a little less than 24 
when I entered the military. I was about 24 and a

05:55.125 --> 05:59.691
half when I left for Vietnam. Did you feel that that 
was comparatively older or younger? I didn't know

06:05.093 --> 06:08.517
at the time, but I felt that that was about average. 
It turns out that if you take the vast bulk of the

06:08.577 --> 06:15.425
people who served there, it was actually a little 
older. An awful lot of the troops were around 19.

06:24.615 --> 06:29.661
And you can't say that the average age was 19, but 
large number were in the 18 and 19 year category. We

06:34.531 --> 06:51.449
even had officers, pilots who were warrant 
officers and we had commissioned officers who

06:34.531 --> 06:51.449
were infantry who'd gone through OCS basic 
training and officer candidate school who were

06:34.531 --> 06:51.449
very young, 20 and 21 years old. So we had a pretty 
young force. What type of mental and or physical

06:57.232 --> 07:04.120
preparations did you make before leaving to go to 
Vietnam and were there any medical? Well you had to

07:04.140 --> 07:10.748
get a battery of shots and they put us on medication 
for malaria as a preventative. Pilots couldn't

07:12.170 --> 07:15.073
take everything that everybody else could. We had 
quinine is one of the preventatives and it

07:20.840 --> 07:23.023
enhances your tendency towards vertigo. So we 
couldn't take that, but we took all the other shots

07:24.045 --> 07:33.318
and

07:24.045 --> 07:33.318
we didn't do any special physical activities or 
anything like that. Had I had it to do over again, we

07:34.600 --> 07:38.786
would have. The pilots, they didn't feel needed to 
do that. We did escape and evasion courses and we

07:42.612 --> 07:49.642
did physical training tests, but not to the extent 
that the Army does now. Right. nor to the extent

07:50.573 --> 07:53.336
that I would recommend. Mental

07:53.376 --> 08:01.965
preparation, really, again, you learn by doing. I 
feel that there could have been a little bit more in

08:01.985 --> 08:15.080
the way of information from people who had served 
as to what you go through mentally once you get

08:01.985 --> 08:15.080
there. And it may be different for everybody, so 
maybe they can't do that, but I would have liked to

08:20.442 --> 08:29.210
have had a little better feel for what a pilot doing 
the kind of mission that I was going to do would go

08:20.442 --> 08:29.210
through. The problem with that is that they don't 
really know where you're going to go exactly until

08:29.870 --> 08:35.835
you get there and start in processing, and we'll 
get into that later, I'm sure. Okay. What was your

08:37.797 --> 08:46.625
general feeling towards the government and 
military before and

08:37.797 --> 08:46.625
after? Well, my father's parents came from Soviet 
Armenia, When he was in the Army, we lived in

08:50.395 --> 08:56.221
Germany right after World War II in 1950. Well, not 
right after World War II, but 1955, 1956. And we

09:01.846 --> 09:05.430
knew people who had escaped from East Germany. 
When we lived in Taiwan, I went to high school my

09:06.691 --> 09:12.657
sophomore and junior years in Taipei, Taiwan. And 
we knew people who had escaped from Red China.

09:14.999 --> 09:18.883
These were not malcontents or people who were on 
the dole. but successful professionals under the

09:19.133 --> 09:22.898
communist systems. And they gave up the easy life 
to get out of there and experience freedom. So

09:28.926 --> 09:38.079
having come from that background, you might 
consider me somewhat patriotic and very

09:28.926 --> 09:38.079
supportive of the government. I also have very 
strong feelings about communism that were borne

09:38.980 --> 09:48.313
out, not changed by my service in Vietnam. Those 
people do things as a matter of policy that are, I

09:48.648 --> 09:56.698
think, less than human. And so I had no qualms at all 
about fighting them at that time. This is getting

10:04.888 --> 10:09.373
ahead a little bit, but on reflection, If we had to 
do over again, I would rather have a policy where we

10:10.231 --> 10:22.206
were fighting to win and where we were staying for 
the duration instead of a one-year tour of duty

10:10.231 --> 10:22.206
because we would have won. People will contradict 
me on that, but we had the war won after 10 of 68. We

10:29.896 --> 10:30.877
had them decimated. They were on their knees, and 
we could have taken them out. We gave them

10:36.084 --> 10:38.787
sanctuaries. both in North Vietnam at times, 
definitely from ground incursions. And they

10:44.970 --> 10:48.113
operated freely in Cambodia and Laos. And we 
operated there, but with constraints. And so we

10:54.199 --> 10:59.004
could have beaten them, but we had no intention. 
The Johnson administration had no intention of

11:00.505 --> 11:03.428
winning the war. They didn't know how to run a war. 
They tried to micromanage from the White House

11:06.323 --> 11:26.446
tactical targets and had the Vietnam War been 
operated like World War II was in Europe under

11:06.323 --> 11:26.446
Eisenhower when he was given the command to invade 
the continent of Europe and defeat the enemy. And

11:26.466 --> 11:29.409
that was the sum total of his mission. That's all 
the interference that he got from Washington. And

11:33.093 --> 11:34.575
the way Bush ran Desert Storm, and we turned it over 
to the military, we could have won. The way it was

11:39.792 --> 11:41.374
won was terrible, terrible. The way it was run was a 
terrible waste. And it was almost criminal the way

11:45.239 --> 11:50.626
some of the lives were squandered in Vietnam. And I 
find that I'll never, never forgive the

11:51.126 --> 11:58.196
administration at that time. By the time Nixon 
took over, there was no nothing to do but get out.

12:05.162 --> 12:07.685
The only question was, how do you get out? And so by 
that time, the die was cast and we had to leave under

12:07.705 --> 12:16.876
some form or another without trying to win. Did I 
answer that question? Yes, you did. Did

12:18.378 --> 12:25.247
you hear or know of people protesting the war 
before you were sent? What was your reaction or

12:26.028 --> 12:29.352
what would have been your reaction if you hadn't? 
If you didn't hear about it before, what... I did

12:31.601 --> 12:39.795
hear about it before, and I...

12:31.601 --> 12:39.795
All war is immoral. I mean, there's no such thing as 
a good war. You might say World War II came close,

12:43.801 --> 12:47.668
but even it was... It could have been avoided had 
the Allies stood up to Hitler prior to his...

13:00.280 --> 13:02.063
conquest of Poland, etc.

13:05.468 --> 13:08.432
So, war is not a good answer. I've been a student of 
history since I was in junior high. I read

13:14.501 --> 13:27.199
extensively about the Civil War, World War I and 
World War II, as well as some of our minor efforts,

13:14.501 --> 13:27.199
the Spanish-American War, etc., And the first 
thing that struck me in junior high and high school

13:28.394 --> 13:40.187
was the terrible waste of war, of materiel and 
resources, but especially fine, fine people. I

13:40.207 --> 13:49.137
mean, that would be productive members of 
society, but they don't have that opportunity

13:40.207 --> 13:49.137
because they're killed or maimed. So I have been 
opposed to war all my life. I have felt, however,

13:56.845 --> 14:01.029
there are times that it's necessary and you do it. 
And I felt that at the time and still do that

14:01.270 --> 14:10.639
communism is an intolerable government style. 
And it was opposed to us. They had declared war on

14:12.762 --> 14:14.083
us. And I felt that we had to do that. The 
protesters, therefore, I felt were either

14:18.608 --> 14:23.713
misguided, short-sighted, or malicious. And I 
did oppose and would have opposed those

14:24.301 --> 14:33.394
protesters, but then they've got the right to say 
what they want to. So as long as we're a free

14:33.514 --> 14:43.447
country, we shouldn't be afraid of ideas that are 
different than ours.

14:47.173 --> 14:52.620
The protests did wind up having an effect on me that 
I guess we'll get into later on. Okay, what part or

14:54.119 --> 14:58.845
what dates actually were you in Vietnam? How long 
were you there? Well, I left on May 5th, which

15:00.387 --> 15:04.512
started my clock ticking, May 5th of 69. And I went 
to the Philippines first for jungle survival

15:04.992 --> 15:09.217
school for a week. So I spent the first week in the 
Philippines. And then I went to Vietnam and went

15:13.202 --> 15:22.253
into Saigon and reported to the 90th Replacement 
Depot. at Long Bend. And all they do is they start a

15:26.015 --> 15:29.738
pipeline, and they sort of feed you through the 
pipeline. And whoever has the greatest need gets

15:30.559 --> 15:34.823
those people to come in. So I had no clue where I was 
going. And the next thing they did was they sent me

15:38.246 --> 15:45.733
to the 17th Group, which was part of the 1st 
Aviation Brigade. And the 17th Group was located

15:46.914 --> 15:50.097
at Nha Trang. and they'd say there's a plane 
leaving such and such a time beyond it, and I'd just

15:50.617 --> 15:56.484
show my orders and get on the plane and go. Went into 
Natrang and spent the night there after

15:58.166 --> 16:03.853
in-processing with the 17th group, again, not 
knowing where I was going.

16:06.876 --> 16:15.887
That night, I was sleeping in the top bunk of the top 
floor of a wooden barracks and heard a noise, and it

16:06.876 --> 16:15.887
woke me up. I was a very light sleeper all my life, 
and it woke me up, And nobody else was moving, and I

16:19.979 --> 16:27.429
didn't want to be the rookie on the block because 
there were veterans there who were out processing

16:19.979 --> 16:27.429
too. So I started to lay back down, and mortar 
rounds started going off. And I looked around, and

16:33.436 --> 16:35.659
I was all by myself. Everybody else was gone just 
that fast. So I put some boots on and went out in the

16:38.303 --> 16:42.768
bunker, and by that time it was all over. And they 
didn't land all that close, so there was no real

16:43.249 --> 16:47.134
danger, but it was amazing how What I had heard was 
the sound of the mortar going down the tube and

16:47.755 --> 16:52.740
being fired. And then the explosions after that is 
what got everybody else's attention. But the next

16:59.087 --> 17:11.660
day, I left Nha Trang and went to Quy Nhon, where I 
was processed into the 223rd Aviation Battalion,

16:59.087 --> 17:11.660
which is a primarily fixed-wing battalion. And 
they sent me to Dong Ba Tin, which is across the bay

17:13.021 --> 17:17.526
from Cam Ranh Bay. to the 183rd Reconnaissance 
Airplane Company, because I knew I was going to fly

17:18.080 --> 17:22.066
bird dogs. That was the only thing I'd been cleared 
to fly. And that's a bird dog company. And they gave

17:28.677 --> 17:36.049
me an in-processing that lasted about a week. So 
I'd been gone from the States about three weeks

17:36.069 --> 17:45.083
when I finally got sent down to Fanthiet, which was 
the home of the second flight platoon. of the 183rd

17:45.991 --> 17:49.436
reconnaissance airplane company. And Fanthiet 
is on the coast. It was an ideal location. It was 90

17:55.105 --> 18:00.212
miles due east of Saigon, 90 miles south of 
Cameron. We were sort of left alone by our higher

18:01.354 --> 18:06.101
headquarters as long as we did our job. And I stayed 
there the entire year. So it was about a year and

18:12.811 --> 18:15.475
three weeks or just a year and two? Well, I was there 
a year and a day. When we talk about

18:17.399 --> 18:23.829
out-processing, I'll tell you a little bit about 
that, too. So, going in, they kind of gave you, you

18:23.849 --> 18:29.458
mentioned before, a week in the jungle. Was that 
actually on the ground? Yes. Learning how to...

18:36.109 --> 18:38.813
They gave us a lot of instruction on escape and 
evasion. and survival tactics in case we got shot

18:39.113 --> 19:09.002
down and we were going to be flying primarily over 
jungle and not entirely as it turned out for me

18:39.113 --> 19:09.002
because I was on the coastal plain and then the 
highlands also and a little triple canopy jungle

18:39.113 --> 19:09.002
there but they would tell us how to avoid the enemy 
what to do assuming you survived the crash what was

18:39.113 --> 19:09.002
the first thing you did what was the second thing 
you did how to get water how to determine if

19:09.910 --> 19:12.994
something was edible. We would open a palm tree and 
eat the hearts of palm right out of the palm tree and

19:15.097 --> 19:32.939
catch water moisture that travels down palm 
leaves at night because it's so humid it condenses

19:15.097 --> 19:32.939
on them when it cools and things like that. The 
checkout in country was how to fire the rockets and

19:32.959 --> 19:38.466
a recheck on communications procedures and 
artillery procedures. Do you remember, I guess

19:45.175 --> 19:59.532
you had mentioned before, you kind of felt like the 
whole time you were going, you were going to go to

19:45.175 --> 19:59.532
Vietnam, but did it shock you at all when you really 
got the news that you were actually going over

19:45.175 --> 19:59.532
there at the time of day? No, the only thing that was 
disappointing was further training once you

20:05.227 --> 20:09.892
completed flight school, was determined by your 
standing in your class in your branch. You had all

20:10.572 --> 20:12.634
these different branches, and I was sonocore. And 
I was number one in my class in my branch. And my

20:16.698 --> 20:28.931
branch had a slot for OV-1s, which is the Mohawk, 
which is a much more sophisticated, large,

20:16.698 --> 20:28.931
twin-engine, turbine-powered aircraft. Really 
a hot, hot thing to fly. And so that was my slot. But

20:35.028 --> 20:45.577
the class leader who had seniority on me and who had 
been on the ground in Vietnam for a year and had just

20:35.028 --> 20:45.577
gotten back had not yet had a full year back in 
Vietnam. So in order to extend him before he went

20:45.597 --> 20:52.643
back over there, they gave him the Mohawk slot, 
which stuck me in bird dogs. As it turns out,

20:53.604 --> 21:00.871
whereas I would have enjoyed flying Mohawks, I had 
such an interesting time. I got to see so many

21:01.331 --> 21:03.533
different things. by flying bird dogs. I would 
have been bored in Mohawks. And it turned out it was

21:08.184 --> 21:12.590
the right thing for me. So it didn't, I mean I was 
expecting the orders and it didn't bother me. Do

21:16.715 --> 21:19.359
you feel that there were other attitudes than 
yours? Do you feel like your attitude was unique

21:19.379 --> 21:24.686
before going to Vietnam? How did the other men 
feel? I don't know. I think probably about the

21:29.151 --> 21:31.054
same. What you have to understand is But that was a 
10 year war. So there was a lot of room for different

21:35.561 --> 21:39.987
attitudes over time. At any one time, at the height 
of the build up, there was 500,000 US troops in and

21:41.689 --> 21:49.258
around Vietnam. A lot of different people with 
different attitudes. There were different

21:51.120 --> 21:55.966
branches of the service, Air Force, Army, Navy, 
Marines. There were different branches within

21:56.987 --> 21:59.871
the Army. There were all these different 
assignments and units. And yet you could have two

22:03.638 --> 22:11.930
people at the same unit at the same time 
experiencing the same thing come away with two

22:03.638 --> 22:11.930
different impressions of what happened. So 
anything I say, you have to take with a grain of

22:11.950 --> 22:15.135
salt. And therefore, I can't speak for anybody 
else, really. I can tell you what some people did or

22:17.859 --> 22:23.988
said, but I can't get inside their head. And I don't 
think I was all that unusual. I know a lot of people

22:28.195 --> 22:31.840
who were looking forward to going there. either 
for their career enhancement or because they felt

22:32.174 --> 22:39.901
about communism the way I did, or because of the... 
I had one NCO when I was in training. We were

22:45.347 --> 22:50.131
learning how to fire mortars in Officer's Basic. 
And he'd been there three times and was trying to go

22:50.151 --> 22:52.654
back again. He'd been wounded once. He still 
wanted to go back. And he was a young, still young,

23:02.009 --> 23:06.515
black NCO, non-commissioned officer, sergeant. 
And he said, I want to go back again because that's

23:06.535 --> 23:10.721
where the action is. This is my profession. That's 
where my profession is being practiced. And a lot

23:15.407 --> 23:19.293
of guys are that way. When you arrived in Vietnam, 
were you surprised by anything? If so, what were

23:23.158 --> 23:25.281
they? Or were you expecting everything you saw? 
What were some of the things that stick out in your

23:27.794 --> 23:33.320
mind about the way people lived, the land itself, 
or the general culture? Well, it had a smell that

23:33.600 --> 23:35.442
was different. A lot of the address of the women 
were different, and some of the men, too. They did

23:40.387 --> 23:41.688
wear pajamas a lot. The black pajamas. Yeah. I had 
seen enough films, et cetera, that the

23:45.713 --> 23:49.437
countryside was what I expected. I had lived in 
Taiwan, so I expected the heat and humidity, and

23:49.997 --> 23:57.565
that wasn't a surprise.

23:59.722 --> 24:13.365
I guess the only thing, when I finally got down to 
Fanfayette, got assigned to the second flight

23:59.722 --> 24:13.365
platoon, the way they do call signs is each platoon 
has a call sign. Actually, each company has a call

24:13.866 --> 24:17.132
sign. And our company call sign was Seahorse. So 
when you go to the second flight platoon, your call

24:20.177 --> 24:24.885
sign is Seahorse to something. The 6 always 
designates the commander, so the platoon leader

24:26.013 --> 24:29.817
is Seahorse 2-6.

24:33.041 --> 24:35.224
The company commander would be Seahorse 6. The 
second flight platoon commander would be

24:35.624 --> 24:37.727
Seahorse 2-6. I was Seahorse 2-2. You don't say 22, 
you say 2-2. Well, when I got there, the fellow who

24:41.992 --> 24:50.822
had had that call sign before me had been, I was 
replacing him, he was shot down and killed about

24:51.663 --> 24:55.827
two weeks before. And the first thing they told us 
was that we had a lot of missions, reconnaissance

24:57.689 --> 25:13.887
missions in the mountains, in this triple canopy 
jungle area, and that we couldn't go in there

24:57.689 --> 25:13.887
single ship because it was too far and too 
dangerous. And all of a sudden, I thought, you

25:15.789 --> 25:21.535
know, this might be a little dangerous. and I might 
not survive this. And for a while, I thought that I

25:24.760 --> 25:45.204
was scared for about the first couple of months 
because about a month after I got there, they said,

25:24.760 --> 25:45.204
we've got too many missions and too few pilots and 
planes, and now you've got to fly in the mountains

25:24.760 --> 25:45.204
in a single ship with nobody to back you up. And so it 
was... All of a sudden, I didn't feel quite so well

25:51.012 --> 25:55.438
prepared and so well trained. And I was, you know, 
when I left, my son was nine months old, and I had

25:55.559 --> 26:03.690
always felt sort of invulnerable. When I was in 
high school and college, you know, I thought

26:04.952 --> 26:08.437
nothing could touch me. I drove my car fast, and I 
had my first crash in an airplane. It was in ROTC

26:15.167 --> 26:20.074
flight training there in El Paso. My second crash 
was in flight school. A guy, another student, was

26:23.266 --> 26:27.534
riding the front seat and I was sitting in the back. 
And he put a wing into the ground and very nearly

26:27.594 --> 26:34.828
cartwheeled us and killed us. And we got out of that 
and he almost put us in the trees on the way out. I had

26:39.764 --> 26:43.188
a near midair with him flying in the front seat. 
He's called his stick buddy, and he's a warrant

26:43.228 --> 26:48.034
officer candidate. He's a good pilot. He just had 
some mental lapses every now and then. We almost

26:52.099 --> 26:53.681
hit a helicopter one day. So none of those things 
bothered me. The crashes didn't bother me while

26:59.268 --> 27:01.631
they were going on. It didn't bother me after they 
were over. For some reason, it just didn't affect

27:03.373 --> 27:06.717
me. But flying into those mountains by myself 
after the guy before me had been killed, that's

27:08.705 --> 27:15.391
sort of unsettling. And I felt a little vulnerable 
at that time. And it wasn't until later that your

27:21.556 --> 27:28.121
attitude changes, at least mine did. So I was a 
little rattled there, of course. Could you

27:31.584 --> 27:35.287
describe an average day, if there was one? What 
times did you do things? Where were you? Well, I was

27:39.921 --> 27:44.768
in Fanthia, and at first I lived out at what we 
called the landing zone, or LZ. It was an airfield,

27:44.788 --> 27:48.152
a pure steel planking runway. And we had a hangar 
there, and some revetments made out of 50-gallon

27:49.173 --> 27:56.543
oil drums, 55-gallon drums filled with sand. We 
parked the aircraft in to protect them from mortar

27:56.563 --> 28:03.252
attacks and things like that. And I'd get up before 
dawn in the morning and get cleaned up. We had...

28:08.138 --> 28:09.119
cold water showers. At least we had showers every 
day. But they were cold water, and I don't care how

28:11.702 --> 28:17.168
hot it is, a cold shower is a cold shower. And we wore 
Nomex flight suits, which is, they're fire

28:17.188 --> 28:27.460
retardant flight suits, and we were pretty 
heavily armed. We put on our, I wore a .45 pistol and

28:28.041 --> 28:38.112
a holster, and we had to have a canteen with you when 
you fly. We'd have an M16. I'd have a survival vest,

28:40.851 --> 28:46.398
and on top of the survival vest, the survival vest 
wasn't flotation. It had a survival radio and all

28:47.439 --> 29:00.835
the stuff you need to operate in the jungle, a 
fishing line and a signal mirror and a survival

28:47.439 --> 29:00.835
radio and a net and just a whole bunch of stuff. And 
then I'd wear two bandoliers of M16 ammunition

29:00.855 --> 29:07.643
with these clips, magazines. and an M16 and a 
flight helmet. So I was pretty weighted down by the

29:10.551 --> 29:12.814
time. And you'd have a morning mission and an 
afternoon mission. And every so often we'd throw

29:18.822 --> 29:27.514
in a noon mission just so you could keep guessing as 
to when you were going to fly over their area

29:18.822 --> 29:27.514
because all we were trying to do was spot them. They 
were hiding from us and we were trying to find them.

29:31.179 --> 29:37.528
And you'd have a mission in support of some unit or 
some operation or another.

29:43.039 --> 29:45.942
We would fly in support of the Navy. They'd send 
cruisers and destroyers up and down the coast, and

29:45.982 --> 30:02.360
they'd get into our province, and we'd put an 
air-naval gunfire liaison or Anglico

29:45.982 --> 30:02.360
enlisted man or officer in the back seat and go out 
and fire missions with these naval ships. So I got

30:03.421 --> 30:05.203
to see how the Navy operated. And mainly what they 
did was they fired into... three fire zones at

30:08.693 --> 30:12.797
bogus targets. I mean, we blew up the same hooch in 
the same bunker all year. You know, you had to call

30:17.863 --> 30:30.996
in a gun damage assessment or GDA just to justify 
the expenditure of the rounds, but we blew up more

30:17.863 --> 30:30.996
bushes than you can shake a stick at firing these 
expensive rounds at them. It's not entirely

30:31.016 --> 30:34.380
wasted, however, because what it does is it tells 
the enemy that you just can't operate with

30:34.867 --> 30:42.574
impunity in this free fire zone, that we're going 
to at least give you a headache and a bloody nose if

30:34.867 --> 30:42.574
we don't kill you. So the Navy was one mission. 
Artillery was another. Artillery batteries had

30:49.901 --> 30:52.764
to be registered. And so we had various 
registration points. We'd go out and fire

30:55.106 --> 30:56.787
registration. Visual reconnaissance was 
another. We'd go out and look for signs of the

30:59.250 --> 31:01.011
enemy. And if we found them, we'd call in whatever 
we could, gunships, artillery,

31:03.166 --> 31:10.254
reaction forces, depends on how many we found. I 
flew in support of an outfit called the Second of

31:11.695 --> 31:17.041
the First Cav, Second Squadron First Cav. They had 
a cavalry as tanks and APCs, armored personnel

31:17.942 --> 31:23.708
carriers. And they have a Delta Troop, which is 
gunships, the AH-1 Cobra gunships. I flew in

31:32.343 --> 31:43.726
support of the 192nd Assault Helicopter Company 
and their gun platoon, which was what we called

31:32.343 --> 31:43.726
Charlie Model, UH-1C gunships. Flew in support of 
the...
