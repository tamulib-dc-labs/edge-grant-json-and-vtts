WEBVTT

00:03.136 --> 00:05.959
I want to be a petroleum engineer. And it hurt that 
you go there and you don't have a problem getting a

00:06.419 --> 00:12.966
job. And so... What did you know? How did you know 
A&M existed? What was your information about A&M?

00:25.539 --> 00:30.464
There really wasn't that many people in Rockwall. 
There was... When I got there in 51, there was one

00:33.123 --> 00:42.515
person I knew who was a senior vet medicine student 
from Rockwall. And, of course, I talked to him, and

00:43.676 --> 00:53.649
also I talked to the guy or two that had gone down to 
the University of Texas, and they were taking

00:43.676 --> 00:53.649
something else. But they advised me that it really 
ought to be going to Petroleum Engineering. That

00:57.573 --> 01:02.860
was where all the jobs and everybody was doing real 
well at major teams. So, there

01:03.430 --> 01:14.994
really, at that time, there really weren't that, 
there wasn't that strong a hold, and it wasn't very

01:03.430 --> 01:14.994
big. At the time, it was 1,499 people, very small 
school, and a small estate, small county estate.

01:24.710 --> 01:30.598
Let's see, I should put this on, since I didn't have 
it turned on when I asked you that first question

01:24.710 --> 01:30.598
about why did you go. This is the 18th of June, 
Thursday afternoon. We're in Fort Worth, talking

01:34.664 --> 01:36.366
to Charlie Sealy. Did you visit the campus before 
you went down to enroll? Yes. And what was your

01:42.274 --> 01:43.436
impression? Oh, I loved it. Yeah. Oh, yeah. This 
would have been in the... on the spring of 51 and the

01:49.516 --> 01:59.167
MSC had just been built and what a spectacular 
place it was. What was their living? That

02:01.309 --> 02:06.875
building, but were there some, were there 
something that they did or didn't do? Were there

02:06.955 --> 02:07.936
people? What impression did you get? Well, I got 
the impression then just like you do now. It's a

02:14.163 --> 02:18.308
very friendly campus.

02:26.945 --> 02:32.991
Were you there for an official kind of orientation 
visit, or did you just go? I don't think they had the

02:33.011 --> 02:39.498
orientation type things then. They're taking the 
entrance test or something. Was this with mom and

02:43.302 --> 02:44.564
dad? Yes. Are you a first generation college 
student? Yes. All right, now let's move forward to

02:49.849 --> 02:53.273
the fall. How did you get there, and what did you 
take with you? I've heard of several people that

03:00.054 --> 03:05.985
give this same type of thing, and I swear to 
goodness, it's just almost the same. It's a mom and

03:06.005 --> 03:19.328
dad take them down and let them out, and there you 
are all of a sudden with a footlocker and a few

03:06.005 --> 03:19.328
clothes and almost no money, and you're left. 
That's the way it happened. No car. And no friends.

03:27.306 --> 03:30.930
Was there anybody that kind of took charge and 
helped you? How did you get to a room that night? How

03:35.034 --> 03:37.157
did you get to the Dunning Hall? How did you know 
where those places were? Well, of course, back

03:40.521 --> 03:44.145
then, of course, we were in Munich. And once I 
finally found the dorm, I don't remember exactly

03:46.612 --> 03:51.478
how, but once I found the dormer, it wasn't much of a 
problem then on. So what unit were you in? I was in

03:54.401 --> 03:57.725
squadron five in dorm 15. This is when we still had 
the freshman area. And all the freshmen were

04:03.512 --> 04:13.064
together with two or three seniors, a couple of 
juniors, and two or three sophomores. But all

04:13.084 --> 04:16.348
freshmen were back on the main campus Nobody was 
out at O'Brien Air Force Base. No, that's right.

04:21.771 --> 04:23.613
And did your squadron have a nickname? No. No, but 
we were one about everything. Do you know how you

04:29.280 --> 04:32.685
happened to end up in that squadron instead of some 
other? I don't think there was. At least I didn't

04:37.892 --> 04:40.255
know. I think you could probably do it now. But I 
didn't know about it. Because, like with the Army,

04:44.000 --> 04:45.762
you had field artillery and this and this, but the 
Air Force was just all. And y'all were living, was

04:52.132 --> 04:57.076
it a whole, was it all a fish dorm? Yes. Describe 
your room as a freshman. What was in, you and your

05:02.801 --> 05:04.983
roommate, what was in that room? The same thing 
that's in there now. Same old dorms. I'm sure that

05:11.549 --> 05:15.192
dorm's still there. Two beds, two tables, two 
chairs, a sink, two closets, that's it. Two

05:25.576 --> 05:25.976
bulletin boards. Was your roommate, did he become 
a special friend? Your official lady? Well, this

05:32.101 --> 05:38.007
was a little unusual. When I got

05:38.527 --> 05:45.313
there, I ended up, at the time, They had a very big 
class and they were short on room space. As a

05:48.698 --> 05:57.130
result, they had to tie a third bed bunk and put a 
third person in there. Well, I think I must have

05:57.150 --> 06:04.861
been in the middle because I had two roommates, 
both of which I really couldn't pronounce their

05:57.150 --> 06:04.861
name and I couldn't understand them. Fish on, I was 
off the hook and Fish would eat him. who we really

06:09.863 --> 06:12.726
became good friends later. But I did and was able to 
let them stay together and move out just to a single

06:13.467 --> 06:21.635
person. And his name was Edwin Dean Bubba Bennett, 
who later drowned at summer camp his junior year.

06:35.990 --> 06:38.993
So I understand what Silvertown's old campus is 
like. Let's see, describe the campus when you

06:39.935 --> 06:48.926
were, what buildings were there and where were 
they when you were a fish? Okay, being in basic

06:48.946 --> 07:00.180
engineering, which is generally what they do, 
most of the classes were in the academic and

06:48.946 --> 07:00.180
faculty hall. Is faculty still there? Let's see, I 
think I might have had a basic course over in the

07:03.070 --> 07:16.704
geology building. I think maybe, of course, I had 
chemistry over in the chemistry building. And

07:26.775 --> 07:32.301
then maybe a basic course over in what I think was 
the old Aggieland Inn, which is just across from

07:26.775 --> 07:32.301
Sosa Vista. and all the meals were excellent. 
Describe how fish were treated your freshman

07:36.532 --> 07:39.895
year. Give me an

07:39.915 --> 07:44.339
example. If you see anything on TV concerning some 
of the,

07:44.359 --> 07:58.373
I guess it was VMI, it's very similar to that. And 
yes or

07:58.792 --> 08:11.567
no,

07:58.792 --> 08:11.567
there's no excuse, sir. Always in the race. See, 
for a client, particularly one that's in the unit,

08:12.087 --> 08:21.558
I always speak to

08:12.087 --> 08:21.558
him. Meals were really... Kind of an unusual time. 
Did you all sit all fish at the same table? All fish,

08:32.224 --> 08:34.567
yes. Well, no. We had a couple of classes in each one 
of the tables. Only one? Generally speaking, one.

08:41.835 --> 08:42.696
With all other fish? All other fish. Okay, because 
that's a little different from the routine I've

08:43.757 --> 08:48.863
heard others describe. Well, this back in this 
time. No, I know. That's... All right, so... Y'all

08:56.757 --> 09:01.723
were allowed to, were there any things you were or 
were not allowed to eat? Well, of course you didn't

09:02.484 --> 09:04.566
get cooked. Oh, okay. Unless you answered a 
question. Okay. And you had to know all the

09:09.312 --> 09:11.575
descriptions. Usually one of the questions was 
the descriptions on the bill and every other

09:11.715 --> 09:23.710
ridiculous thing in the world that you can think 
about and can't think about. Was there any

09:23.730 --> 09:25.752
question that was... legendary that kind of 
everybody asked, everybody failed? Was there

09:32.045 --> 09:32.525
any?

09:35.609 --> 09:36.530
I don't know if there was. I don't remember. I'm 
sure there was something that you never could

09:36.910 --> 09:46.862
answer. Yeah, I know what you mean. Let's see. 
Describe a typical weekday routine from the time

09:53.845 --> 09:57.595
y'all got up to the time you went to bed at night? 
What happened to when? Well, the first thing, of

09:59.339 --> 10:06.859
course, you'd have a glissom job, blowing the 
glissom in the dawn. Waking up, first call, second

10:07.261 --> 10:19.595
call, and fall

10:07.261 --> 10:19.595
out. About what time? I want to think it was 6.30, as 
soon as possible. I think we'd get down, fall out

10:23.039 --> 10:29.326
about 7, and then we'd have to be in class at 8. Then, 
of course, they'd tell you what uniform to wear, if

10:29.346 --> 10:33.190
it's raining or whatever. Of course, we wore the 
uniform every day.

10:37.501 --> 10:52.657
But then we had

10:37.501 --> 10:52.657
to fall out and hold

10:37.501 --> 10:52.657
inspection.

10:54.278 --> 10:56.741
And then walk to chapel. And you all ate in? In 
Subesa. In Subesa, yeah. And then after that, walk

11:02.087 --> 11:04.369
back, clean up the room. night class, whatever the 
classes are, come back, fall out for chow again,

11:04.788 --> 11:17.835
and barf for chow again. and classes and labs and 
whatever it is you need to do. That would

11:28.031 --> 11:41.711
normally be up until about 5 o'clock, and then at

11:28.031 --> 11:41.711
5, you know, you could do even flight football or 
different things like that. In many cases, when

11:41.732 --> 11:46.118
the company bull rings, you have to go out and walk 
for hours on end. Not necessarily food.

11:52.044 --> 11:56.270
It would just be a company thing. It wouldn't be 
reported to, at that time, Ross Hall. In the

12:02.961 --> 12:11.515
evenings, after supper, what was the routine?

12:13.756 --> 12:17.441
I think we got back up about 7.30. We'd have CQ until 
about 10 o'clock. As a freshman and as a sophomore,

12:23.849 --> 12:27.113
at least 60 points on the floor. Four on the chair 
and you're three feet.

12:33.321 --> 12:42.733
And if you had the other restroom or anything like 
that, you'd have to put a pass on your name tag out on

12:33.321 --> 12:42.733
the outside of the door. Then

12:43.118 --> 12:53.854
there'd

12:43.118 --> 12:53.854
be lights out at about 10, 30, something like that. 
Give me examples from any of your years of some good

12:53.874 --> 13:10.037
little tricks, jokes, pranks that you knew about, 
whether you were involved in them or not. Do you

13:11.080 --> 13:24.958
remember the

13:11.080 --> 13:24.958
old water

13:11.080 --> 13:24.958
tower? It's a long way up. I guess this was my 
sophomore year. I stayed

13:30.745 --> 13:34.891
over the freshman. I stayed over the first 
semester of my sophomore year, freshman year and

13:34.951 --> 13:38.235
sophomore year. I

13:39.059 --> 13:56.908
remember getting a couple of freshmen, my 
roommate, going up on the Yard Tower and facing the

13:39.059 --> 13:56.908
ball there on top of that thing. The Air Force Blue. 
I don't remember, but I know this. It took off some

14:02.165 --> 14:11.360
paint, and there must have been 20 or 30 coats of 
paint on that ball. All different coats. You were

14:12.522 --> 14:13.744
not the first, were you? No. A lot of red. Where did 
y'all get the paint?

14:19.674 --> 14:22.438
Gee, you know, I really don't know. And what hours 
of the night did y'all go up there? Oh, it must have

14:25.550 --> 14:33.918
been probably one o'clock or something like that. 
How long would it take to go from ground up? How long

14:40.885 --> 14:41.345
was the climb? Well, I don't think it was that long, 
except he was pretty far. He was kind of where he

14:46.330 --> 14:49.774
had. It would probably be 20 minutes from the time 
he was on the ground. And this is after 1030? No,

14:53.818 --> 14:56.961
this is after 1030. And so it was the very top of the 
water tower that was painted? No, just the bottom.

15:03.307 --> 15:04.128
That's right. Okay. And how did you all secure 
yourselves as you were on the very top painting?

15:12.316 --> 15:14.058
Well, all four of us couldn't get out there. Thank 
goodness. So I was up at the top of the edge. I was

15:17.181 --> 15:20.464
getting one fresh one that made it out there and did 
the painting. So on each other's shoulders and

15:20.798 --> 15:23.183
that sort of thing? No, no, no. There's a ladder 
that goes up. There's a ladder on top of it. So you

15:28.273 --> 15:30.858
have a ladder to go on. It's still a little spooky 
out there. About how many nights did it take? Just

15:34.705 --> 15:35.507
one night. Oh, one night. No, it's just a big ball. 
It's probably 24 inches. And how long, do you

15:42.938 --> 15:49.969
remember how long it was before somebody else's 
group went up there and painted it a different

15:42.938 --> 15:49.969
color? I don't think it took too

15:49.989 --> 15:54.757
long. Oh. McCabe probably had artillery red. All 
right, do you remember any pranks, a good blow on

15:59.144 --> 16:04.453
somebody? Well, let me tell you this one. This is 
pretty different. I had a pretty fancy roommate as

16:09.837 --> 16:19.029
a sophomore there. I just followed along with the 
manager. But we went over to Memorial Stadium and

16:23.595 --> 16:31.525
we had two carloads, two sophomores and a 
freshman. It was moving

16:32.534 --> 16:56.721
in

16:32.534 --> 16:56.721
the fall

16:32.534 --> 16:56.721
of 50, early September, October of 52. And at that 
time, we were going to the grass field. And by the

16:57.782 --> 16:59.344
time we got there, it must have been 2 or 3 o'clock in 
the morning. And we took some oats. It's spelled

16:59.944 --> 17:00.685
out. And of course I'm 55, 56 for the freshmen that 
did a lot of work. And went

17:11.208 --> 17:16.893
out and talked it in real well.

17:20.017 --> 17:26.844
I'll have to say it looked pretty good on 
Thanksgiving Day on national television. That's

17:26.864 --> 17:27.384
great. That's great. How many participated in 
that? Well, there's two cars, so I'm guessing

17:31.006 --> 17:36.954
probably about 10. And nobody got caught, no hint, 
no anything?

17:43.043 --> 17:43.484
No. All right. But they came back the next year. But 
they weren't quite as smart as we were, because

17:48.311 --> 17:52.917
ours showed up so well. We probably had letters 
that were maybe 20 yards or so tall. They went all

18:00.487 --> 18:06.636
the way across Kyle Field. But it was right on a yard 
line. So it really didn't show up in the U. It was the

18:13.106 --> 18:14.648
same way. It made it square. So it really didn't 
show up nearly as dramatic as they are today. Now,

18:20.357 --> 18:23.642
was it known on campus who had done this? I don't 
know that anybody knows. So y'all kept it a secret

18:27.366 --> 18:29.750
for a long time. Oh, OK. All right, what about some 
pranks played on somebody on the campus? Some

18:36.661 --> 18:39.746
upperclassmen that y'all didn't like? We had all 
kinds of different things going on.

18:49.525 --> 18:52.549
I mean, let me think about that just a minute. Like, 
surely y'all stole a footlocker every now and

18:52.569 --> 18:55.854
then. I mean, hit a footlocker. Well,

18:57.877 --> 19:07.471
of course, the big thing back then was drowning out 
the whole dorm. And, boy, you end up doing that. I

19:09.373 --> 19:10.435
mean, getting bothered. They take the head off of 
one of the colognes. And they just do it on the top

19:14.301 --> 19:17.565
floor. I do remember waking up. In the middle of the 
night, I probably hadn't been there in months. It

19:23.780 --> 19:25.583
was fresh water. The water was just going 
everywhere. Coming down the steps, it looked like

19:27.386 --> 19:31.272
a, I mean, it looked like a waterfall. Everybody's 
out there, you know, in the middle of the night,

19:32.414 --> 19:37.563
sweeping water. It seemed like it took until 
daylight just about to finally get all the water

19:37.583 --> 19:43.292
swept out of it on. I knew they

19:43.846 --> 19:50.152
weren't good. Let's go the other way. Did you lock 
your room door? Normally during the day or night? I

20:01.703 --> 20:03.084
don't think we did. Did you ever have anything 
stolen? No. Do you remember anybody that did? No. I

20:10.071 --> 20:12.553
don't think we ever had anything stolen. Let's 
see, did you all ever roll anything under

20:12.803 --> 20:23.759
anybody's door with any kind of explosive inside 
it?

20:26.343 --> 20:31.932
No, but I'll tell you, we did have a guy who we had our 
own radio station. It's watered by. Oh, tell them

20:32.973 --> 20:35.317
about that. The guy's name was Charlie Parker, who 
actually went into radio, I think, after that. And

20:43.246 --> 20:48.211
he really had quite a show. He played music and so 
forth. The whole dawn would be listening to him

20:51.094 --> 20:54.797
instead of the regular radio. Did he have an 
identification, call letters or anything? No, I

20:58.881 --> 20:59.982
don't think so. And it was just so weak. The FCC did 
not know that. The FCC did not know that. That's

21:04.827 --> 21:06.028
correct. But you all didn't have any Babel bombs?

21:11.313 --> 21:12.274
I remember...

21:15.157 --> 21:18.540
No, really, I don't remember that. Alright, what 
about nicknames for food and beverages in the chow

21:18.560 --> 21:23.945
hall? Oh, they're the same as they always were. 
Share them with me. Well, bread, you know,

21:26.167 --> 21:36.256
gunwale, bullock, lube for gravy.

21:36.276 --> 21:37.037
Milk, tea? Cow, you know. I don't remember what tea 
it was. Was that horse? Beans?

21:50.047 --> 21:57.118
Gas?

21:57.439 --> 21:58.581
Was that beans?

22:01.626 --> 22:03.989
But anyway, it was there. And were all desserts 
Cush? All of them were Cush. Let's see, how did you

22:12.734 --> 22:15.298
dress for class?

22:18.744 --> 22:21.428
Always in a uniform. What about men? I never went to 
a class before, I don't know, all four years, I

22:22.129 --> 22:28.159
didn't have a uniform. And normally, you either 
had the choice of being in the, at that time, the

22:28.179 --> 22:34.249
fatigues were not capitalized, they were good. 
And so either you wore a uniform. And we really

22:37.635 --> 22:39.518
didn't have combat boots. Either you wore your 
fatigue with a cap or your normal either green or

22:40.207 --> 22:57.938
pink shredder in the wintertime or khaki in the 
summer. A while ago I thought of a question that I

22:57.958 --> 23:01.063
haven't asked anybody else. Do you remember your 
first fish haircut? Oh, yeah. Where'd you get it? I

23:07.568 --> 23:09.811
was at MSC downstairs. I thought it was ruined 
forever. What did it look like when you looked in

23:13.275 --> 23:18.963
the mirror? There wasn't much hair. I mean, it was 
just flat on top. Do you remember whether it took

23:23.569 --> 23:26.152
long for him to do it? No, no, I didn't

23:26.292 --> 23:30.217
think it took long. Did a group of you fish go 
together? Yeah, I recall we had about five or six

23:32.789 --> 23:43.401
officers waiting for the last minute that you had 
to. And let's see, was there any other

23:43.421 --> 23:51.331
nomenclature involved other than a fish haircut, 
white sidewalls? Was that a part of the nickname

23:51.351 --> 23:54.274
for it? For the haircut? No. So it was just a fish 
haircut. All right. Describe then how your life

24:02.236 --> 24:07.684
was different as a sophomore. A little, a little of 
what I told you about in the sophomore year. But

24:14.454 --> 24:29.357
at least, as you well know, the only friend that you 
have on the campus in the school, or your fish

24:14.454 --> 24:29.357
buddy, or your sophomore buddy, or your junior 
buddy, whoever it is, It's certainly not the

24:30.164 --> 24:35.751
upper-class one or the lower-class one. So as a 
sophomore in St. Lyons,

24:36.572 --> 24:49.367
I didn't particularly enjoy being in the freshman 
area as a sophomore.

24:49.387 --> 24:53.331
That really wasn't why I wanted to go. The second 
semester I ended up going on over to Yeah, the

24:56.708 --> 25:05.859
freshman area and also the core area, I guess, the 
new area, as you call it. Yeah, I lived over there

25:05.879 --> 25:07.461
the second semester. It's part of 10th, which is 
the, back then it was the smart spot. So you were,

25:15.611 --> 25:19.276
you know, over in the Duncan dining hall. Yes. Was 
there anything different about eating, dining in

25:19.836 --> 25:24.522
Duncan compared to Sabeasa? I think so. I think the 
food is about the same. They kind of did it the same

25:28.521 --> 25:31.464
way and so forth. Only this time we have

25:32.145 --> 25:39.414
seniors, juniors, and a lot more. In hindsight, 
describe Aggie food. Well, I thought it was good. A

25:47.283 --> 25:52.770
lot of the other people didn't necessarily like 
it, but gee, compared to being growing up on a farm

25:53.054 --> 26:03.067
and when we had beans, you know, different types of 
beans, at least four or five days a week. Those

26:04.449 --> 26:07.534
ready pork chops and things weren't that bad. Do 
you remember what it cost your semester or year? I

26:12.060 --> 26:21.272
think, if I'm not mistaken, the room and the board 
caused it. Everything was about $250 a semester.

26:27.866 --> 26:28.707
That was everything. Did you have a job ever on 
campus? No, but I worked very intensely all during

26:31.211 --> 26:39.823
the summer. What did you do? What kind of jobs did 
you have? Different things. Construction for a

26:43.188 --> 26:47.955
couple of years there. Oil field for one year and 
then the next year. The summer camp, which I had

26:51.745 --> 27:02.039
spent time working at the aluminum factory.

27:04.342 --> 27:08.507
So were you able to earn enough in the summers to 
pretty well pay your bill? Pretty close. Pretty

27:11.271 --> 27:12.733
close. About how much money did you spend, let's 
say free spending money? None. But, you know, the

27:19.876 --> 27:31.509
last two years, if you sign a contract, then they 
pay you about $30 a month or something like that. I

27:31.529 --> 27:33.231
think it's about $100. It wasn't a lot. Boy, we

27:36.534 --> 27:43.462
thought it was marvelous at the time. Well, I 
didn't have a car. So if I left at all, I didn't

27:46.625 --> 27:48.988
hitchhike. Back then, there wasn't a problem at 
all. We had the line, which was... Now, where would

27:51.319 --> 27:55.205
that line be? Where did you go to catch the line 
from? From, say,

27:59.271 --> 28:10.447
Bryan to

27:59.271 --> 28:10.447
St. Alex 4. It was down just on the north side of, I 
guess it's Highway 6. Very important. All right,

28:22.069 --> 28:26.796
so you went downtown Bryan to... All right, now 
how'd you get from campus down there? I can't tell

28:26.816 --> 28:28.058
you. I do not remember. I'm sure I probably just 
been driving through. Somebody just got a ride

28:30.382 --> 28:32.325
with someone. There were no cars going back and 
forth. In Rockwall, where did you get off? It

28:37.906 --> 28:46.156
wasn't really easy, but there was a place in Downs 
where you'd have to go down. And it was on Highway

28:46.176 --> 28:48.839
75. I wouldn't go there now. It'd really be right in 
the south area. I don't think it was right there.

28:59.553 --> 29:02.316
And you came down Highway 75 to Madisonville? 
Actually, no. He turned off at... Turned off at

29:09.133 --> 29:11.435
Richland, south of Corsicana? That's correct. 
Okay. And go to Bahia. And then to Bahia to have a

29:14.077 --> 29:15.879
party. Did you ever have any unusual hitchhiking 
experiences that you can share?

29:25.508 --> 29:25.868
There are. There are. I don't know how you live 
through those. One time I was in Houston. the day

29:36.715 --> 29:42.601
that I ended up married. We had gone together in 
high school. Her father was the principal of the

29:48.146 --> 29:52.911
school at Rockwell. We ended up moving to 
Paulsville, just east of Longview. For some

29:56.514 --> 30:02.220
reason, I thought, it was my freshman year, I 
thought I had to go see her. I hitchhiked from

30:02.240 --> 30:05.743
Houston all the way to Longview to Paulsville and 
then back. I think I might have had a riot back, but

30:06.736 --> 30:20.492
getting up there and going through some of the East 
Texas oil fields with this roughneck who was

30:06.736 --> 30:20.492
absolutely, had been working day and night and 
couldn't stay awake. I really didn't know whether

30:21.453 --> 30:23.976
we were going to make it or not. And then one time 
coming back from Houston, I can remember

30:24.837 --> 30:34.988
for some reason in a uniform, attracted maybe some 
of the most undesirable people. And I ended up

30:40.918 --> 30:52.209
getting out of the car at Hempstead to catch 
another

30:40.918 --> 30:52.209
accident. You know, I didn't think anything at all 
about Hempstead. Did you ever hear of any of your

30:56.213 --> 31:02.159
friends having any truly bad... Not a real 
problem. Nobody shared one of those with me yet?

31:05.495 --> 31:08.658
All right, now let's do some academics. As you 
think back on it, who were some of the, for you, who

31:08.818 --> 31:34.320
were some of the important teachers and or 
advisors, counselors?
