WEBVTT

00:02.528 --> 00:04.912
Today is June 20, 1974. We'll be interviewing Dr. 
James D. Lindsey, former head of the chemical

00:05.893 --> 00:11.962
engineering department.

00:18.872 --> 00:22.718
Dr. Lindsey, if you would, would you tell us when 
and where you were born? August the 24th, 1899, in

00:24.020 --> 00:31.371
Jamaica, Long Island, Jamaica, New York. 
Queensborough. Queensborough. Could you tell us

00:34.963 --> 00:40.650
a little bit about your family, your father's 
name, your mother's name, and how your father was

00:34.963 --> 00:40.650
employed? Well, my father was a sailor aboard a 
sailing ship. When he left home, his mother

00:46.977 --> 00:58.430
remarried, and he was kind of forced out of the 
home, and he went as a cabin boy of the old days of the

00:46.977 --> 00:58.430
sailing ships and did quite a bit of sailing. Then 
he came ashore.

01:02.418 --> 01:07.364
and got a job packing boxes in the shipping 
department. He was in that. Where was this? In New

01:09.286 --> 01:10.167
York City. New York City. And what was his full 
name? James McCrossin Lindsey. And your mother's

01:17.435 --> 01:18.216
name? Ida Augusta Tucker was her maiden name. 
Lindsey was her last name. Can you tell us? She grew

01:27.726 --> 01:30.990
up in New York, Brooklyn, New York. Tell us a little 
bit about your boyhood days in New York. Well, it

01:36.832 --> 01:39.635
was a country town when I was there.

01:45.301 --> 02:01.838
One of the boys' radio was just coming in, and there 
was an older boy around the neighborhood that was

01:45.301 --> 02:01.838
interested, and he built his own radio receiving 
set, and I got so I could read the code, and that is

02:02.476 --> 02:06.643
the call signals. I couldn't read when they got 
going fast in the code signal. But it was just a

02:09.548 --> 02:14.897
small town, country town. It's grown up into large 
apartments around. I had a sister that

02:21.127 --> 02:27.538
was one of the wanderers of the family. went up to 
the North Coast, North Cape, and she got to be a

02:28.683 --> 02:34.148
school teacher. And she taught down the Panama 
Canal, and she taught up in a hospital up in New York

02:35.410 --> 02:44.739
State. She was a physical education teacher, and 
she got in giving remedial physical education to

02:44.919 --> 02:53.728
people who needed it. She went all over the world on 
her vacations and also some jobs. She and I, I had an

03:03.232 --> 03:09.721
older brother that died many when I was just a young 
boy, appendicitis. Didn't know much about

03:10.182 --> 03:12.486
appendicitis in those days. And so we grew up and 
I've lost track of most of the people. There's one

03:22.822 --> 03:23.783
boy that We bought a second-hand canoe and kept it 
down in Jamaica Bay, close to one of the present

03:24.792 --> 03:30.539
airports.

03:33.663 --> 03:35.185
We sailed around Long Island. In a canoe? Yeah, 
there's a string of, just like down in Padre

03:37.387 --> 03:48.761
Island, there's a string of islands along the 
ocean shore, and then you've got the Long Island

03:37.387 --> 03:48.761
Sound on the inside. So it's... It's an inland 
waterway. It's an inland waterway, yeah. That

03:57.057 --> 03:58.439
sounds like a fascinating experience. Well, it's 
entertaining at least. And he is the only boy that I

04:01.502 --> 04:06.308
keep up with up there in Jamaica. Are there any 
experiences that really stand out in your mind in

04:08.091 --> 04:16.281
your boyhood that might be interesting, anything 
that happened that you remember or recall?

04:22.657 --> 04:26.922
We used to go coasting about Washington's 
birthday. There was a very fine go almost for about

04:26.983 --> 04:30.887
a mile. There was a hill, there's a ridge of hills 
along the backbone of Long Island. And there was

04:36.475 --> 04:39.659
quite a hill in the back of our house. And climb up to 
the top of it. Anybody ski in those? No. No skiing?

04:49.371 --> 04:50.132
No, no skiing. It was way back on a hill back of us, 
and they had a very fine band, and every evening

04:51.412 --> 05:09.715
about 6 or 7 o'clock, they'd get out and parade with 
that band just to keep in practice, and we used to

04:51.412 --> 05:09.715
hear that coming over there. So that area was 
really pretty much small-town America at the

05:09.735 --> 05:13.099
time. Right. This is right. Could you tell us a 
little bit about your education? Well, as my

05:19.913 --> 05:36.314
father was not an educated man, so when I finished 
high school, I

05:19.913 --> 05:36.314
didn't have any trend towards further education. 
And I went to work for a pharmaceutical company

05:36.355 --> 05:45.887
called Pfizer, Charles Pfizer, Inc. And as a lab 
boy, washing the dirty beakers in the lab and

05:47.082 --> 05:54.132
sweeping the floor and the like. When was this that 
you went to work for Pfizer?

06:01.422 --> 06:03.265
Well, it must have been right around 1918. I'm not 
too certain. See, I finished high school. I go up

06:07.170 --> 06:08.232
with the years. Right up with the close of World War 
I and without. Yeah, I guess so. See, each year,

06:17.947 --> 06:21.571
most of the year, I'm on the same date as the year. 74 
in August, I get to be 75. I can place things that way

06:25.014 --> 06:30.120
when things happen. So I think I went to work for 
Pfizer about 1918. Was that a large company then?

06:36.506 --> 06:37.207
No, no. It was quite a small company. Very small. 
Very small. And I had a very fine boss. What was his

06:44.595 --> 06:45.095
name? James Nimrod Curry. Very fine. Dr. Curry, 
he's retired now in Vermont. He must be about 96, 97

06:53.668 --> 06:56.394
years old. And he was like a father to me. And the 
only man I know that has hair growing on the palms of

07:01.445 --> 07:07.258
his hands He got a burn with bad, with phosphorus, 
very bad burn. Phosphorus, white phosphorus is

07:12.089 --> 07:15.654
bad. Tissue scars started growing together and 
they grafted on his stomach down on three sides and

07:15.794 --> 07:33.441
folded it down and then sewed it on three sides and 
kept it there for two weeks and then cut it off on the

07:15.794 --> 07:33.441
fourth side. And the hair from his stomach still 
grows on the palm of his hand. And he's, we've kept

07:38.322 --> 07:40.868
in touch. Well, he was the one that urged me to go to 
school, go to night school, and I went to night

07:42.151 --> 07:48.086
school for a couple of years. Where was this that 
you went to? Columbia University. Columbia.

07:50.832 --> 07:51.394
Night school. And he saw I could do that. I was a 
willing worker, and he saw I could do that. And then

07:57.627 --> 08:12.350
the next thing he urged me to do was to go to a regular 
day college rather than night school because you

07:57.627 --> 08:12.350
can only take one course at night and it would be so 
much quicker to work it out in a day college. And

08:13.372 --> 08:19.281
because the middle western schools were so much 
cheaper than those in the east, quote one of my

08:19.666 --> 08:23.171
friends, I went way out west to Michigan. Anything 
across the Hudson River is out west to the New York

08:23.411 --> 08:28.057
people. That's his advice. Let me interrupt you 
here and get back to something that I want to ask.

08:34.225 --> 08:35.707
Well, I don't want to take all the time. No, no, no, 
this is fine. We've got plenty of time. The

08:38.290 --> 08:44.038
question I wanted to get back to is we skipped over 
your elementary and on up to high school

08:38.290 --> 08:44.038
education. Jamaica High School. Jamaica High 
School. Jamaica High School. And consider you've

08:46.921 --> 08:48.964
got to a fairly good background there? I think so. A 
good one? I think so.

08:56.393 --> 09:04.386
Are there any particular people that stand out 
from those years that might have been

08:56.393 --> 09:04.386
inspirational in your life? Well, there was a man 
by the name of Reynolds who was He used to coach the

09:10.426 --> 09:14.071
rifle team, and that's how I got to know him. Not 
that I was a real rifle expert, but he was a fine

09:14.111 --> 09:31.353
gentleman, and he was the one that urged me to try 
and do something first to get into a job, help me get

09:14.111 --> 09:31.353
this job over there at Pfizer's and the like. He was 
always trying to keep the boys going towards

09:32.395 --> 09:37.902
higher education and the like. How long did you 
work for Pfizer? Well,

09:41.138 --> 09:46.445
they were very, very fine to me. They were very 
fine. And after I went to regular school at

09:49.509 --> 09:58.821
Michigan, they had a job for me every summer 
vacation. How did you get out to Michigan? Why

10:00.063 --> 10:00.483
there? Why did you go there? Why there? Because I 
didn't know a soul, didn't know anything. I'd

10:07.693 --> 10:08.574
never traveled. We'd never traveled. And 
Michigan was a good school. Oh, yes. That's what,

10:14.359 --> 10:16.982
on Dr. Curry's recommendation. Oh, now he 
recommended you. Yeah, we talked it over and I sent

10:18.203 --> 10:21.907
away and got a lot of catalogs. I had a bunch of 
catalogs from all over. And it was basically on Dr.

10:24.991 --> 10:27.894
Curry's recommendation. And what year did you 
start Michigan?

10:33.760 --> 10:34.661
Must have been about 1920. 1920? Yeah, I finished 
in And you'd already had a few courses. A few

10:40.272 --> 10:41.213
courses. It's helped out quite a bit. Freshman 
chemistry and some of those things helped out

10:43.575 --> 10:46.699
quite a bit. And then you went on to the University 
of Michigan majoring in? First originally

10:51.604 --> 10:55.188
towards chemistry. Got a B.S. in chemistry.

11:03.742 --> 11:10.891
I worked for Pfizer's every summer, and they 
really wanted me to go back to work for them. They

11:10.911 --> 11:13.715
really wanted me to go to work on a permanent basis. 
And I hated to turn them down, but I'd gotten the

11:15.377 --> 11:22.005
smell of fresh air. See, when I worked for 
Pfizer's, I'd get in the subway, go up to Columbia,

11:22.926 --> 11:32.398
come on down on the subway, transfer to It was an 
elevated railroad at that time, right back out to

11:32.750 --> 11:38.577
Jamaica on the elevated railroad. And I'd done 
that for about three years, I guess. Had three

11:46.225 --> 11:50.070
courses, three or four courses off. Well, two 
years it was, 1918, 1920.

11:56.297 --> 11:58.960
And I just didn't... I got the smell of the fresh air 
out there at Michigan and made some very good

11:59.193 --> 12:05.863
friends out there. In fact, one was the best man at 
my warden and another one... I don't usually tell

12:12.553 --> 12:13.975
this. He and I, the only time I've ever been in jail 
was with that old boy. Don't put any of that in my

12:21.527 --> 12:26.515
memory. His father was a ticket agent. in a very 
small town

12:29.146 --> 12:34.173
in Michigan. And I visited there. One of the 
Thanksgiving or some vacations, I'd visit there.

12:42.465 --> 12:43.546
His name was Dempsey. We called him Jack because 
the real Jack Dempsey was just coming along then.

12:47.933 --> 12:49.335
Wilmer Foster Dempsey. His name was Wilmer? 
W-I-L-M-E-R, Wilmer. A family name, Wilmer

12:56.365 --> 12:58.748
Foster. And

13:00.635 --> 13:19.395
so he

13:00.635 --> 13:19.395
was going with a girl out there in Ann

13:00.635 --> 13:19.395
Arbor.

13:20.636 --> 13:21.697
Happened to be a nurse. They had a nurse's training 
school there. Can't you get a date for a friend of

13:27.023 --> 13:29.325
mine? So he got a date from me, blind date, and she 
was a nurse. And I went with her, but I didn't make

13:42.746 --> 13:51.757
out too well, a few dances and things like that and 
the like. And I went to then this fellow, Roy

13:53.779 --> 13:56.022
Wilson, who was another very good friend of mine. 
His mother kept a rooming house. She was a widow and

14:01.505 --> 14:03.627
kept a rooming house there.

14:07.572 --> 14:14.941
We both went to work for the Standard Oil of Indiana 
in Whitey, Indiana, south of Chicago, about 30 or

14:07.572 --> 14:14.941
40 miles south of Chicago. Was this after you 
graduated? After I got the B.S. degree in chemical

14:18.565 --> 14:20.007
engineering.

14:22.610 --> 14:23.752
Well, in pure chemistry. Then...

14:29.262 --> 14:41.796
I had a Model T Ford, and so about once a month or so, 
we'd go back and visit his mother, see his mother

14:29.262 --> 14:41.796
back in Ann Arbor, about 200 miles as I remember it.

14:44.979 --> 14:55.270
Just by chance at all, walking down the street, I 
met this nurse who I'd had a few dates with, And it

14:56.195 --> 14:57.678
started all up again. And that's the girl that I 
married.

15:04.751 --> 15:09.821
So chance has played a very important part in my 
life. That's really amazing. Well,

15:13.067 --> 15:18.237
we got married.

15:21.710 --> 15:26.977
I decided that I wanted to get some more education 
instead of a BS degree. I wanted to get into

15:26.997 --> 15:28.859
teaching, basically. I wanted to get into 
teaching instead of working in industry. You were

15:31.423 --> 15:32.804
still working for Standard Oil? Standard Oil of 
Indiana. And

15:35.868 --> 15:43.298
so looking around, if you want to get into 
teaching, go back and get an advanced degree. And

15:44.019 --> 15:48.465
that's what governed my going back to school. And 
when did you go back? About 1930. 1930. So you

15:51.861 --> 15:54.385
worked for Standard Oil for a while. Well,

15:55.066 --> 16:04.841
one of my good friends, I went to work for a couple of 
years with the Kelvinator Corporation in

15:55.066 --> 16:04.841
Detroit. That was when they were manufacturing 
refrigerators. And he had such a much better job

16:09.188 --> 16:19.003
than

16:09.188 --> 16:19.003
the Standard Oil Company that I went to work for. It 
was about two years with Standard and about two

16:21.850 --> 16:28.439
years with... What did you do with Standard Oil? 
What was your duties and responsibilities?

16:34.087 --> 16:45.543
Well, first kind of a breaking in period in the 
laboratory, you know, and all that various tests

16:34.087 --> 16:45.543
and the like, and then working out in the plant, in 
the manufacturing plant. Elias in between the...

16:47.772 --> 16:51.696
the plant operators and the technical people 
inside. Was this research or quality control?

16:55.981 --> 17:00.066
Well, seeing that they were doing the right thing 
out in the plant, basically. They changed the

17:00.106 --> 17:05.051
temperature and operating pressure. In the early 
days, it was straight distillation. Shell

17:11.158 --> 17:13.881
stills, just a bunch of tanks. went to Berkshire 
and had a bill to fire on any of these tanks. Didn't

17:19.460 --> 17:21.404
have catalytic crackers in those days. Oh, no, 
they had none. In fact, they didn't have any

17:22.927 --> 17:36.595
fractionation, where you'd get the different 
grades from the crude oil because it had a string of

17:22.927 --> 17:36.595
eight of these horizontal tanks. in the first tank 
where you'd boil off the lighter stuff and pass it

17:36.878 --> 17:59.038
on to the next one and you'd boil off the heavier 
stuff and by the time you got to the last tank you had

17:36.878 --> 17:59.038
heavy rigid and each tank you'd condense so it was a 
heavier material quite a lengthy process oh yeah

17:36.878 --> 17:59.038
then they got And that was just exactly, that was 
just the time when these fractionating towers

17:59.187 --> 18:27.996
came in, what they call a pipe still, where you have 
a big furnace, several times bigger than this

17:59.187 --> 18:27.996
room, pipes around the wall of the furnace, and 
just had a big gas or oil fire inside, and you look

17:59.187 --> 18:27.996
inside, the whole thing was hot, and yet that would 
heat these, the piping would pick up the heat, Then

18:28.533 --> 18:34.018
you'd bring it to a distillation column and go into 
it and have trays. And it would vaporize and you'd

18:34.759 --> 18:40.405
have reflux. And on each tray, you'd get the 
lightest stuff off the top and the heaviest stuff

18:41.285 --> 18:46.290
off the bottom. Instead of having a series of these 
steel tanks, great big steel tanks, 20 feet in

18:46.330 --> 18:54.338
diameter, we're taking a little fraction off. 
you'd vaporize there, you'd put it in to this

18:54.892 --> 19:22.890
column, which may be 30 feet in diameter and maybe 
40 feet high, 50 feet high, and you'd have trays in

18:54.892 --> 19:22.890
each one where the vapor would go up through caps, 
bubble caps, and the liquid, you'd put reflux down

18:54.892 --> 19:22.890
the top, and the liquid would come down from the 
top, And the heavy residue would come out the

19:23.866 --> 19:30.335
bottom, and the overhead, light overhead, would 
come out the top. And at different points in this

19:30.796 --> 19:33.760
tray, you'd take off cuts. Instead of having a big, 
long series of great big tanks taking off the cuts,

19:34.220 --> 19:40.910
you'd take off cuts up and down this column. When 
did this system come in? That system came in... Oh,

19:47.913 --> 19:49.915
about 1922, 23. I went there in 24. And they had it 
there. And they were just starting. Just

19:55.462 --> 19:56.042
starting. In fact, they started up one of the 
biggest. They started up a pipe still for the first

20:00.948 --> 20:04.492
time when I was there that first year. Where was the 
location of this refinery? Whiting, Indiana.

20:07.295 --> 20:09.197
It's about 40 miles south of Chicago.

20:12.241 --> 20:13.382
Then you went to Kelvinator. What were your duties 
at Kelvinator? watching manufacturing

20:15.537 --> 20:19.343
operations and doing research. You did research. 
Could you tell us a little bit about the research?

20:22.969 --> 20:27.537
Oh, primarily corrosion resistance, just 
finding some of the best materials. This is for the

20:27.617 --> 20:29.720
cooling unit? Right. Yeah, that's right. And 
anything come out of this research that you did?

20:36.792 --> 20:37.613
No. Nothing in particular? No, just pick the best 
materials that would stand out about it. What were

20:45.494 --> 20:48.920
they using at that time? Steel, but different 
alloy steel would be better.

20:57.454 --> 21:03.043
Oh, my friend, Larry Phillips, went up and just did 
fine in that organization. He got to be on their

21:08.481 --> 21:14.547
board of directors, and he just did fine in 
Kelvinator. And then you went back to school after

21:14.567 --> 21:16.649
Kelvinator. And I went back to school about 1930. 
And where was this, back at Michigan? Michigan,

21:21.974 --> 21:23.195
back at Michigan. And when did you receive your... 
In 1934. You received your Ph.D. Ph.D., so you got

21:30.327 --> 21:33.671
your master's degree when? In between, right in 
there. And I converted to chemical engineering

21:35.894 --> 21:41.321
rather than pure chemistry. I see. Was this 
probably because of your industrial experience?

21:45.507 --> 21:46.308
Yeah, that's right. I made heavy water for a job. 
Have you heard of heavy water? Yes, I have, in

21:53.057 --> 21:56.281
conjunction with atomic experiments. Well, you 
can...

22:00.668 --> 22:12.700
One of my former, well, he was a teacher there, and 
when I went back to school, he was looking for

22:00.668 --> 22:12.700
somebody to come and help him work on a research 
project for making heavy water. If you pass

22:13.521 --> 22:23.971
electricity through water,

22:13.521 --> 22:23.971
the heavy water, the heavy hydrogen will break up 
easier than the light hydrogen. So he made a bunch

22:25.313 --> 22:28.836
of electrolytic cells And it was my job just to keep 
the water level as you ran 24 hours a day. And so I

22:35.620 --> 22:37.862
kept that. And where was this? At Michigan? Yeah, 
Ann Arbor and Ann Arbor. He was an organic chemist.

22:47.512 --> 22:50.815
And you see, you can make materials out of 
hydrogen. You know what an organic chemist, like

22:50.855 --> 22:54.919
methane is CH4. And you use heavy hydrogen instead 
of light. ordinary hydrogen, why those materials

22:59.933 --> 23:11.567
you make will have different properties than the 
other, the light hydrogen and so

22:59.933 --> 23:11.567
on. And

23:11.587 --> 23:24.943
we've kept in touch with him, that man that was 
doing the research under whom I was working,

23:11.587 --> 23:24.943
making that heavy hydrogen for. So

23:24.983 --> 23:29.248
then... I finished there in 1934 and there were no, 
that's when we had a big depression. There weren't

23:38.577 --> 23:47.229
any teaching jobs and

23:38.577 --> 23:47.229
so I took a job doing research on fertilizer.

23:49.673 --> 23:58.425
Muscle Shoals originally had been a munitions 
plant in Alabama.

23:58.692 --> 24:00.894
They converted that to a fertilizer plant. It was 
just having to do with nitrates. Right.

24:03.997 --> 24:05.999
Phosphates, to phosphates primarily. But 
nitrates and phosphates. So I went down there to

24:09.923 --> 24:13.847
eat on, really. And my boss knew I was looking for a 
teaching job when I went down there. He came to me a

24:23.196 --> 24:26.279
year later, are you still interested in teaching? 
And I said, yes. So he said, well, a friend of mine is

24:29.928 --> 24:39.420
dean of engineering out in Idaho, and he's looking 
for a chemical engineering teacher. And if you

24:41.443 --> 24:44.687
want it, you can have it. So I said, I'll take it. So 
then I really did go out way out west, as one of my

24:47.530 --> 24:57.623
friends said when I went to Michigan and taught 
there for a couple of years. in Idaho, University

24:58.953 --> 25:01.455
of Moscow, Idaho. Yes. Is that Idaho State or 
University of Idaho? University of Idaho. And

25:10.443 --> 25:26.698
we have what's known as the American Society of 
Engineering Education, which is engineering

25:10.443 --> 25:26.698
teachers all over the country.

25:28.433 --> 25:31.937
Most engineering would go to these meetings. They 
usually, it's a cheap, I mean, they hold it at some

25:31.977 --> 25:35.540
college. It's not a drinking national meeting 
like a good many of these national meetings are.

25:42.067 --> 25:43.568
It's a hard working bunch.

25:46.791 --> 25:50.935
So, I went to North Carolina State. It's like a 
slave market. In other words, people are looking.

25:58.420 --> 26:02.744
So I went to North Carolina State for one year. At 
the same time, I was talking to these people, but

26:03.826 --> 26:08.591
North Carolina State came through first. I 
accepted that in Raleigh, North Carolina.

26:14.256 --> 26:18.701
Two years, I have been very, very lucky in this deal 
here. Two years as assistant professor at the

26:21.284 --> 26:27.330
University of Idaho, Moscow. one year as 
associate professor at North Carolina State.

26:35.875 --> 26:45.890
Came to Texas A&M as a full professor in a combined 
chemistry and chemical engineering department.

26:46.952 --> 26:49.856
Three years as a full professor is not bad, is it? 
You're right. Well, just wait for another couple

26:51.038 --> 26:53.301
of years. It was in a combined chemistry and 
chemical engineering department, and the dean of

26:54.142 --> 27:00.249
engineering was trying to get it spread. It was in 
the School of Arts and Science, and I didn't

27:00.269 --> 27:17.270
realize what I was getting into, but there was a 
battle going on between the dean of engineering

27:00.269 --> 27:17.270
and the School of Arts and Science whether they 
should separate engineering into the School of

27:00.269 --> 27:17.270
Engineering or whether they should keep it in 
there. And, boy, once I found out what was going on,

27:17.850 --> 27:22.596
I walked a straight and narrow path. And then 
another year after that, I got to be made head of the

27:23.099 --> 27:30.046
department. Okay, let's back up a minute before we 
get into that, before we jump into it. Now, you

27:33.450 --> 27:36.413
spent a year at the University of North Carolina? 
One year, right. Then you came to A&M. How did you go

27:39.156 --> 27:41.799
about getting to A&M? Well, at the same time, I was 
talking to North Carolina. That's one of these

27:47.204 --> 27:50.828
ASEE slave market deals. I was talking with the 
Texas A&M. Who were you talking to? As I remember,

27:59.261 --> 28:04.226
it was a Mr. Gilchrist. I think he was the one that 
actually hired me. He was the one that actually

28:08.510 --> 28:10.272
hired me. Now, it was a cockeyed operational 
because he hired me, but I was in the School of Arts

28:11.773 --> 28:20.562
and Science in the literary school. And did you 
decide to come to A&M? Did they offer you a more

28:24.189 --> 28:26.291
attractive position? All of it was a boost in rank 
and a boost in pay.

28:32.959 --> 28:34.601
And this was toward the end of the Depression now. 
This is 37? 38. 38. This is

28:36.903 --> 28:42.650
right at the tail end of the Depression. Yeah, I 
think so. And traditionally, this is the way

28:45.253 --> 28:49.958
chemical engineering Originally, to go into the 
history of this stuff, originally

28:51.693 --> 29:06.448
they used to teach industrial chemistry in the 
School of Arts and Science. How you made sulfuric

29:06.468 --> 29:16.038
acid and just a descriptive discussion of how you 
made various materials. And then The MIT people

29:19.553 --> 29:33.851
came out with a new idea, which

29:19.553 --> 29:33.851
they wrote a book called Unit Operations.

29:34.772 --> 29:41.261
And here it studied different kinds of heat 
transfer. Well, the first one is fluid flow.

29:44.244 --> 29:48.750
Pressure drops through a pipe, whether you're 
pumping oil or whether you're pumping water or

29:49.102 --> 29:52.045
whatever. The same fundamentals will apply 
regardless of what you're pumping. The same thing

29:57.390 --> 30:00.073
is true in heat transfer. If you're heating 
something up, the same fundamentals would apply

30:00.133 --> 30:08.861
whether you're heating oil or whether you're 
heating water. And that same idea was taken into

30:10.403 --> 30:18.130
all kinds of so-called unit operations, fluid 
flow, heat transfer, distillation, the

30:18.886 --> 30:28.895
fundamentals of what you are doing, rather than 
the descriptive of how to make sulfuric acid. And

30:28.915 --> 30:34.961
that idea was brand new in chemical engineering, 
in teaching. Instead of a descriptive course, it

30:35.161 --> 30:38.985
was a how to do it course. And that started MIT and, 
of course, the northern schools, Wisconsin.

30:48.383 --> 30:53.909
Those schools picked it up and put it in, in 
chemical engineering. But it took quite a while

30:53.929 --> 31:00.436
for the country boy schools, and I don't mean that 
he... No. It took quite a while for that idea to get

31:00.556 --> 31:05.862
out to the smaller schools. It's really kind of 
unusual, because here you had a school that was

31:06.002 --> 31:12.909
supposedly teaching the how-to-do of various 
things. It was originally planned. had

31:15.316 --> 31:18.480
agriculture teaching people how to do it. It's 
unusual. Well, there wasn't anybody had written a

31:20.804 --> 31:29.015
book on this so-called unit operations book put 
out by the MIT people. It was brand new. About 1920,

31:33.401 --> 31:38.709
that book came out. Then you came here now in the 
fall of 38. Fall of 38, as a full professor. Right.

31:45.923 --> 31:48.848
With full teaching load? Yeah, I think so. Well, a 
little bit of time supposed to be for research, but

31:50.110 --> 31:55.178
not very much in those days. And at that time, I 
believe, T.O. Walton was president. Right.

32:00.707 --> 32:01.268
That's right. C.C. Hedges was head of the 
chemistry department. C.C. Hedges. Cut the

32:14.345 --> 32:39.357
Well, Mr.

32:14.345 --> 32:39.357
Gilchrist, who was Dean of Engineering, wanted to 
get the chemical engineering taught in the School

32:14.345 --> 32:39.357
of Engineering under him, rather than in the 
School of Arts and Science.

32:41.395 --> 32:43.757
So he approached me, would I be willing? And once I 
told him I'd be willing, but I couldn't take any

32:43.898 --> 32:50.224
sides in the matter. And he understood that. And so 
they used to have a board of directors meeting to

32:54.108 --> 33:03.037
graduate, legally graduate the students. And 
then they'd have a reception for the parents after

33:05.439 --> 33:11.065
the graduation. And all the staff used to go to that 
reception to meet the parents of the students. So

33:19.063 --> 33:22.151
Mr. Gilchrist beckoned me over. You're going to be 
working for me this summer. So the same board of

33:25.419 --> 33:30.792
directors that had graduated the students, they 
had decided to separate the department. So he sort

33:32.298 --> 33:34.422
of rammed it through the board of directors. Oh 
yes, he was for that all the time. Do you think he had

33:36.746 --> 33:40.914
any opposition to forming a chemical engineering 
department? Oh yes, the old boy Hedges, Professor

33:41.154 --> 33:44.942
C.C. Hedges, didn't want to let it go. He didn't 
want to lose his chemical engineering section.

33:48.989 --> 33:49.630
That's right. It's only normal, I suppose. And 
then this was what, 39 and 40? No, about 41, I think.

33:57.327 --> 33:57.587
41. I think it was about 41. And Mr.

33:59.871 --> 34:13.515
Gilchrist, the old,

33:59.871 --> 34:13.515
had the old geology building. I don't know whether 
it's... They taught petroleum in it for a long

34:16.739 --> 34:20.002
time. That one used to have a tower on it. Used to 
have a water tank in it. Right, right, a water tank

34:23.165 --> 34:25.948
inside of that tower, right. And so he said, we'll 
put you over there this summer, but it won't be long

34:27.530 --> 34:39.942
before we have a regular chemical engineering 
building for you. About two or three years it'll

34:40.883 --> 34:43.506
take to get us separated. And that was from about 41 
to about three or four years ago when they built

34:44.212 --> 34:57.018
this new engineering building up on the corner, 
maybe five years ago. So we were in that old geology

34:57.038 --> 35:02.288
building for many years. And then they built a... 
Every time somebody moved out, I'd get my foot in

35:03.736 --> 35:09.843
the door to get a few extra rooms. They built a very 
nice... It used to be petroleum, too, in there.

35:16.230 --> 35:19.073
Chemical engineering has to do with the 
distilling of the oil. The petroleum engineering

35:21.395 --> 35:29.424
has to do hunting the oil, finding the oil, and 
getting it up out of the ground and transporting it

35:21.395 --> 35:29.424
through their pipelines. And then chemical 
engineers take over at a refinery and have to do

35:33.149 --> 35:36.233
with the separation of the products. When was the 
department accredited? Do you remember? Say, no,

35:41.341 --> 35:42.342
I don't. I'd have to, it was, we went through a long, 
hard series of troubles in getting us accredited.

35:51.936 --> 36:01.890
First was, there's a lot of things, getting the 
equipment and getting enough staff and I don't

35:51.936 --> 36:01.890
recall. I'd have to look it up. Let's drop back a 
minute now. We've got up into the 40s. When you

36:07.646 --> 36:12.230
first came here, do you have any impressions of, 
say, President Walton? He was here until 1943.

36:13.871 --> 36:18.135
Well, I thought he was a very good president. Did 
you have any personal relationship with him at

36:18.155 --> 36:20.878
all? Oh. Did you ever get called into his office to 
talk to him?

36:32.279 --> 36:33.060
I sure did. Harrington, too.

36:43.593 --> 36:50.301
One of the things that I inherited was cotton seed. 
They do a lot of cotton seed, growing cotton here

36:50.321 --> 37:01.054
and making cotton seed oil and chicken feed out of 
what's left after you squeeze So that was going on

37:01.658 --> 37:10.148
when I came, but I inherited a lot of that. And so we 
had this short course in cottonseed oil. And it

37:19.759 --> 37:21.201
wasn't too large. About 80 and 90 people would come 
to it. Is it in the summertime? Usually, yes. And

37:29.831 --> 37:31.193
then...

37:33.502 --> 37:39.429
So

37:33.502 --> 37:39.429
we'd had that. I'd had that experience with that 
cottonseed short course. Then I started a, well,

37:42.993 --> 37:54.385
I'd take our students out on inspection trips. And 
things had changed so much since I was a boy in a

37:54.405 --> 38:03.255
refinery, why they had automatic recording 
instruments and control instruments. If you

38:08.494 --> 38:17.207
wanted to change a valve or read a gauge, you'd have 
to climb a steel ladder to read it and twist the

38:08.494 --> 38:17.207
valve yourself. Whereas I'd come down here quite a 
few years later, and they had recording

38:18.809 --> 38:27.042
instruments and control. You didn't have to do all 
of that. You had a little house, a regular house,

38:28.924 --> 38:32.770
where they had these recording instruments in. 
And so I thought we should teach some of that. And I

38:39.202 --> 38:43.090
didn't know anything about automatic control or 
the like. And I wrote to a bunch of companies that

38:44.031 --> 38:50.483
made these instruments, asking for their 
catalogs and information. And one afternoon, a

38:51.966 --> 38:56.715
chap showed up in my office. from one of these big 
companies and said, we've had requests for

38:56.932 --> 39:04.980
information from all kinds of people, but we never 
had a request from a college professor. What did

39:05.080 --> 39:06.481
you want to know for? So I told him what I had in mind 
of teaching that stuff in our classes, and he

39:08.122 --> 39:21.435
thought that was a very fine idea and agreed to work 
with me. And then he said, well, it sure would be

39:21.495 --> 39:26.820
good if we could get some of these older people 
acquainted with the operations of these

39:27.222 --> 39:33.632
instruments, as well as your new students just 
coming through. So having been associated with

39:34.574 --> 39:40.343
this oilseed course, I said, well, maybe we can do 
that, too. And so we started an instrumentation

39:41.986 --> 39:46.673
short course. And it was very, very elementary at 
the start. We'd meet in the classrooms. have the

39:52.450 --> 39:58.660
exhibits in the halls of the building, and it has 
developed very, very fine. That's still going on?

39:59.782 --> 40:00.924
It's still going on. And the new student center in 
1950, when we had the student center built, why,

40:01.926 --> 40:10.641
that was a big help. And we get about 600, 700 people 
attend it now, and they come from all over the

40:11.542 --> 40:17.412
country. It was the first one that got started, 
even before there's an Instruments Society of

40:17.982 --> 40:25.971
America that got started now. Do you remember the 
year you held your first meeting? Oh, I think I'd

40:30.015 --> 40:34.920
have to look this up, too, about 41, 42. I

40:35.141 --> 40:43.950
can get all of this factual material. And...

40:49.420 --> 40:51.442
So it's mighty fine. I've made mighty fine friends 
in that organization. Well, where I got to know

40:55.786 --> 41:07.717
these presidents a little bit more,

40:55.786 --> 41:07.717
as you know, a lot of these guys from industry like 
to have a drink. And there's a lot of salesmen

41:08.117 --> 41:10.139
around. And they're selling the instruments. And 
the people from the big companies will be using the

41:12.501 --> 41:17.706
instruments.

41:19.441 --> 41:28.333
And so I got called down to the president's

41:19.441 --> 41:28.333
office. They found five bottles, whiskey 
bottles, in

41:29.294 --> 41:41.189
your

41:29.294 --> 41:41.189
wastebaskets in the room. What room is this? In the 
student center here on the campus. And there's not

41:48.432 --> 41:52.938
supposed to be any... What president was this in 
the country? Well, I think it was Walton was the

41:53.018 --> 42:01.309
first one, and it was just when Harrington was 
taken over. And Harrington was a teacher in the

42:01.790 --> 42:05.895
chemistry department. Well, let's see. Walton 
was here until 1943, and then Bolton until 1944,

42:07.177 --> 42:16.409
and then Gib Gilchrist until 1948, and Bolton 
again, and then Harrington the first time in 1950.

42:16.690 --> 42:16.870
Yeah. Well, anyway, every little while this thing 
would happen.

42:24.586 --> 42:26.868
So I had gotten called down there. I know 
Harrington, he sure didn't want to do it because he

42:26.888 --> 42:35.676
lived down the street from me before he got to be 
president. But he had to do it. And when I got told

42:38.878 --> 42:46.165
that they found him in the wastebaskets of the 
room, I put out the word. If any time you guys empty a

42:46.786 --> 42:53.976
bottle here on the campus, why, put it in your 
suitcase and take it home with you. And I never had

42:53.996 --> 42:58.983
any trouble from then on.

43:00.585 --> 43:04.751
So that's how I originally got to... I mean, I got 
called down to the president's office a couple of

43:05.532 --> 43:09.398
times. One was real bad.

43:14.905 --> 43:16.708
There was one... over in the board of directors 
house. And one of the guys really got intoxicated

43:22.230 --> 43:27.098
over in the board. You don't remember our old 
student center across the street from the,

43:28.299 --> 43:40.738
remember when they crossed the street from the 
mess hall? right next to the old president's

43:41.107 --> 43:43.190
house. This used to be the Aggieland Inn? 
Aggieland Inn, yeah. I've seen pictures. It was

43:45.954 --> 43:47.736
torn down right as I— Yeah. Well, anyway, several 
years ago. Well,

43:50.400 --> 44:00.914
they used to have displays in there. It was quite 
elementary. But it's—we've changed things up and

44:03.617 --> 44:10.827
hold them now at the end of the semester. Well,

44:11.060 --> 44:20.051
digress a little bit here.

44:24.276 --> 44:27.960
What do you remember of the end of the Depression 
here on the campus? Was there many hardships from

44:28.100 --> 44:31.264
the teaching faculty? Did

44:31.905 --> 44:37.692
anybody know there was a Depression going on here? 
I don't remember too much about that. Was it an

44:42.169 --> 44:48.460
island of relative prosperity in a country that 
was having hard times? We had a harder time to get

44:49.763 --> 44:53.610
jobs for the students. I worked very closely with 
the students in getting jobs. That was something

44:58.278 --> 45:02.245
that I was always... good relations with the 
students. In fact, the matter is, they gave me an

45:05.584 --> 45:08.407
automobile when I retired. Yes, I know.

45:12.471 --> 45:28.406
Well, anyway,

45:12.471 --> 45:28.406
working hard, that was the hardest thing, is 
getting jobs for the students.

45:28.426 --> 45:30.308
But I don't recall that we had

45:34.186 --> 45:35.131
trouble. See, I was here and our staff was pretty 
well fixed.
