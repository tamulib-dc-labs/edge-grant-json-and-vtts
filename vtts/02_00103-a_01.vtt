00:02.495 --> 00:19.710
15th of July, sitting at 2720 Camelot and Bryan in a 
very comfortable, looks like a TV room, with

00:02.495 --> 00:19.710
Colonel Joe T. Haney, about to chat with him about 
his experiences, particularly with the A&M Band.

00:24.466 --> 00:37.881
Hello, here I am sitting with Haskell watching the 
new patio we just put in the back and it's such a

00:24.466 --> 00:37.881
beautiful day and we're both glad to be here and we 
hope this is a fruitful experience.

00:44.148 --> 00:49.073
Let's begin with your briefly summarizing your 
experience growing up and going to college and so

00:50.150 --> 00:57.163
forth, before going to high school and all, before 
you came to A&M? Where was home? my home is in marlin

00:58.604 --> 01:28.611
texas and i was a product of the marlin public 
schools and i graduated from marlin high school

00:58.604 --> 01:28.611
and upon graduation in may my mother packed me up in 
my uh with my foot locker and sent me to texas a m and i

00:58.604 --> 01:28.611
became a fish in the texas aggie band and i lived in 
bezell hall what this was the summer of 1944

00:58.604 --> 01:28.611
and uh i was in the band that summer and then after 
the end of the summer well I have vacated A&M and I

01:28.591 --> 01:46.532
had to prepare myself to go into the service you 
know the war was going on then when you're 18 years

01:28.591 --> 01:46.532
old you're gone and so I entered the the armed 
services, the army. I went to Sam Houston for basic

01:49.839 --> 02:08.976
training and then at this point in time I was 
offered an opportunity to go to officer's

01:49.839 --> 02:08.976
training school which I could see in 19, right at 
1945 that the war was near completion so I decided

01:49.839 --> 02:08.976
not to go that route. I stayed in there for two 
years. I spent 14 months in Korea. When I was in

02:16.029 --> 02:25.547
Korea, I played in the 282nd AGF band and was 
stationed in Seoul, Korea. lived in the Red Cross

02:25.527 --> 02:49.240
building and we had a rehearsed every day and every 
afternoon before the movie for all the troops

02:25.527 --> 02:49.240
there in Seoul we would play a concert four days a 
week we would play with a concert band and three

02:25.527 --> 02:49.240
days a week we would play with a large dance band or 
stage band and So I got some marvelous experience,

02:49.760 --> 02:56.286
and I stayed over there about 14 months. Then upon 
arrival back in the United States with my

02:56.306 --> 03:09.699
honorable discharge in my hand, I decided to study 
music, which I could not do at A&M, so I went to

02:56.306 --> 03:09.699
Southern Methodist University. In 1950, I got a 
Bachelor of Music there, and then started

03:10.660 --> 03:17.607
teaching band. My first band job was in Hemp Hill, 
Texas. Started the band there. It was the only one I

03:22.839 --> 03:34.887
could find in the state of Texas that had not had a 
band before because I wanted to learn about twice

03:22.839 --> 03:34.887
as much as they did, which I did. At that point, I got 
this marvelous offer to go to Calvert, Texas.

03:42.159 --> 03:45.464
Calvert was really a blow-and-go in town in those 
days. I was a counselor at a boys' camp in Rio Vista.

03:49.690 --> 03:52.555
I had the president of the school board signing 
Calvert. And he hired me on the spot, and so I stayed

03:53.108 --> 03:59.193
in Calvert for four years, which were very 
fruitful years. So that would have been 1950. That

04:01.295 --> 04:05.699
was 1951 to 1955, I believe. And we had a real good 
band in Calvert, which they had not had before, but

04:07.121 --> 04:15.608
we did a lot of work and growing. And I decided that I 
needed to go to a larger system, so I went to

04:15.708 --> 04:23.115
Wharton, Texas, as the band director. And I stayed 
there only one year, and the job at Mahea opened.

04:29.272 --> 04:40.304
And I went there with Mr. Alton Bowen, who 
eventually became the head of the Texas Education

04:29.272 --> 04:40.304
Agency and was also the superintendent of schools 
here in Bryan. And so I moved to Mejia with Mr.

04:41.225 --> 04:43.907
Bowen. And I stayed there 16 years. And they were 
very fruitful years. And we had an outstanding

04:49.553 --> 04:53.077
band program there. And from there, I came to A&M in 
1972. Colonel Adams, who was the director of the

04:59.005 --> 05:08.126
Aggie band, and I had been friends for years and 
years before this took place. We used to hunt quail

05:08.387 --> 05:16.626
a lot, and our band and the Aggie band did exactly 
the same kind of 65 precision marching. And so we

05:17.517 --> 05:30.452
decided, Mary and I decided that this was a great 
move and so we moved to Bryan in 1972 and I became the

05:17.517 --> 05:30.452
associate director of the Fightin' Texas Aggie 
Band. And in 1973 when Byrne retired, well I became

05:31.153 --> 05:44.048
the director of the Aggie Band and that was 
certainly a marvelous experience to just

05:44.467 --> 05:50.498
continue the work in the 65 precision marching 
that I had been doing for all those years. I was a

05:50.618 --> 05:58.171
high school band director for 22 years before I 
came to Texas A&M. So I was not just somebody that

05:58.211 --> 06:01.677
fell off the turnip truck. I kind of knew what I was 
talking about. Our bands in Mejia had been

06:03.721 --> 06:24.725
consistent sweepstakes bands all those years and 
we had many many many students in the Allstate band

06:03.721 --> 06:24.725
and we had quite a few that went on to study music and 
become band directors and besides that in Mejia I

06:03.721 --> 06:24.725
had 31 places I could hunt quail and and had a nice 
golf course to play. Mary and I both had carts and

06:24.745 --> 06:32.293
six or eight wonderful places to fish and it was 
just it was a marvelous experience there. but of

06:32.273 --> 06:51.092
course as soon as I got used at A&M got used to the 
fact that driving up to the big buildings and

06:32.273 --> 06:51.092
parking in my own parking place well then we began 
to settle down and do the work at hand and so I stayed

06:32.273 --> 06:51.092
then at Texas A&M for 17 years and I retired in 1989 
and after having 41 years in teacher's retirement

06:52.523 --> 07:03.858
so I've had a full life directing bands in the state 
of Texas. Splendid. Did that brief, let's see you

07:06.542 --> 07:10.307
were here as a student only one summer? One summer, 
that is correct. Did that get embedded in your

07:12.149 --> 07:15.814
heart deeply? Well, I had that a lot earlier, 
Haskell, because all of my family on one side had

07:16.081 --> 07:26.837
graduated from A&M. And they were dyed into wool 
laggies, and I was bleeding maroon when I was 10

07:27.458 --> 07:33.428
years old. And I really, that's the only place that 
I wanted to go. But now when I came in the summer of

07:38.335 --> 07:42.882
1944, I studied accounting. and that was what I had 
maybe a CPA or something of that nature and I

07:43.739 --> 08:01.613
decided that that's not what I wanted to do and and 
so that's the main reason I did not come back but it

07:43.739 --> 08:01.613
has always been deep in my heart and of course The 
Aggie band has always been my favorite band in this

08:02.082 --> 08:06.086
world. And when I became a director down here, well 
then it was my number one interest other than my

08:06.987 --> 08:15.617
family and Marion. And I just have had this maroon 
all my life I guess, this maroon blood, and I just

08:15.837 --> 08:28.731
don't guess I will ever get it out of my system. Now 
that brief experience in the Army with a band, that

08:29.183 --> 08:39.970
was primarily a performance band, not much 
marching? Well it was, we were there in Korea. I

08:42.857 --> 08:44.661
played in several bands. through

08:44.641 --> 09:00.321
basic and just the post bands and then when I went to 
I decided not to go to officers training school

08:44.641 --> 09:00.321
then they sent me to Fort Monmouth New Jersey and I 
became a radio operator And I played in a very fine

09:00.942 --> 09:03.385
band up there. We played for the likes of Big Damone 
and several others while I was there. And then when

09:09.152 --> 09:16.881
I went overseas, the radio operator's job was not a 
pleasant thing. They would send us up in these

09:16.941 --> 09:22.048
mountains where it was about 15 below, and you'd 
send code back and forth. And the communists there

09:22.108 --> 09:25.752
did not know that the war was over. and it was not 
very much fun so the first pass that I received I

09:25.732 --> 09:48.347
went to Sewell and I saw this big band sitting up 
there on that stage playing this broadcast and I

09:25.732 --> 09:48.347
said oh my goodness wouldn't that be marvelous so I 
go in and talk to the Lieutenant Miller who was in

09:25.732 --> 09:48.347
charge of the band and he played with the Dorsey 
Orchestra and the New York Philharmonic And he

09:48.935 --> 09:50.938
asked me what I played. I told him. And he said, 
well, would you be interested in moving over here?

09:56.766 --> 09:57.987
And I said, I certainly would. He said, are you 
good? I said, yes, sir, I am. He said, well, I want to

10:00.691 --> 10:06.699
hear you because our first trombone player just 
left and went back to the States and we don't have

10:00.691 --> 10:06.699
one there. So I go on trombone. so i go back there and 
audition for him and he said you'll be here next

10:08.662 --> 10:29.725
monday if you want to come i said yes sir i do and next 
monday there was a jeep waiting for me about six in

10:08.662 --> 10:29.725
the morning to take me to sewell and i stayed there 
most i stayed there about 13 months in that band it

10:08.662 --> 10:29.725
was a marvelous band and he was a marvelous man and 
on saturday he would give us uh arranging a little

10:30.650 --> 10:41.415
course in arranging and composing and chords and 
musical facts that we needed to know to be a

10:30.650 --> 10:41.415
composer and arranger. And I really enjoyed that. 
And I think that's the main thing that that made me

10:45.533 --> 11:01.872
change my mind as to what I wanted to be and I still 
thank a lot of him and I'm sure he's passed away but

10:45.533 --> 11:01.872
he was such a fine man and such a fine musician and he 
really influenced my life and what I wanted to do.

11:02.408 --> 11:09.999
And the military style marching, the six to five, 
so that came kind of naturally. In high school did

11:11.421 --> 11:13.564
you all? Well in high school we did not really march 
to the yard lines. You know now they march to the

11:17.470 --> 11:19.573
yard lines. You take six steps to the yard lines 
every yard line and you hit that with your six steps

11:19.593 --> 11:29.547
and that's the main way that we stay in line. You 
march a 30-inch step in the service, and of course I

11:30.472 --> 11:47.704
liked that, and I didn't like the high-stepping, 
prancing things, and my high school band was

11:30.472 --> 11:47.704
really quite good at that. We marched and did many 
things. We were on television five times just

11:50.607 --> 11:58.174
because we were good, not because our football 
team was good. And we marched at the Cotton Bowl and

11:59.135 --> 12:03.840
things of this nature, played for the governor 
several times. And that was fascinating to me, the

12:04.681 --> 12:15.852
things that you could do with a group just on a 
football field. But if those lines, when they

12:15.832 --> 12:29.419
start putting the lines in, and the main reason 
they did that is mostly for the bands, because the

12:15.832 --> 12:29.419
football fields years ago were just lined off 
every 10 yards, some of them every 20 yards. And so

12:29.939 --> 12:40.354
then they started putting it in and it just 
simplified everything and gave the bands a larger

12:29.939 --> 12:40.354
opportunity to do a lot of difficult things. And so 
I just loved that and I did all of the drills myself

12:40.374 --> 12:51.530
for 17 years and I just got a big kick out of doing 
them. I just really enjoyed it. Doing it and

12:53.092 --> 13:22.660
watching them doing it and then to see to see if it 
worked out real good and usually it did they those

12:53.092 --> 13:22.660
guys are all smart and they they could play well and 
You put those two together with a good drill and you

12:53.092 --> 13:22.660
just have something that's really nice to watch 
Now your SMU band experience it was They played

12:53.092 --> 13:22.660
they were they were they played the football band 
played jazz most of the time and they were high

12:53.092 --> 13:22.660
steppers and I did it and but I also played in the 
symphonic band and I played in several brass

13:23.450 --> 13:45.846
choirs and things of this nature and I studied 
privately on the horn and that

13:23.450 --> 13:45.846
was mostly a learning experience on playing and I 
was trying to learn how to Teach all the other

13:45.826 --> 13:55.395
students in the school when I when I started 
teaching how to play all the instruments I had to

13:45.826 --> 13:55.395
learn how to play all the brass instruments all the 
woodwind instruments. I had a lesson in

13:55.415 --> 14:02.461
percussion in strings and So this was more or less 
an educational experience. Although it was a nice

14:02.561 --> 14:04.283
musical experience. We had some great players 
there but the I just marched in the in the Mustang

14:04.303 --> 14:14.432
band because I Had to do it was one of the main 
reasons I had to do it and I wanted to do it And I like

14:15.037 --> 14:16.920
jazz. I like the jazz that they play. And so I really 
enjoyed that up there. And then in Sam Houston,

14:22.767 --> 14:32.240
when I got my master's degree, it was more or less 
just a continuation of what we were doing. And I

14:33.121 --> 14:37.067
also played in the Houstonian, which was their 
jazz band down there. And I got my tuition for the

14:37.087 --> 14:41.112
summer there playing in that band. But the 
marching, 65 marching came when I came to Mahea. I

14:48.213 --> 14:49.374
had not done that. The East Texas bands over there 
do it, and they still do it. And I had the first

14:56.343 --> 15:04.553
National Association of Military Marching Band 
contest here, which I was one of the founders of

14:56.343 --> 15:04.553
that. And we had 24 bands, and the requirements 
were that you played a military-oriented music,

15:11.602 --> 15:17.368
and you had to march in military style. And if you 
did not meet these requirements, you couldn't

15:17.969 --> 15:20.272
enter. And the first year we had it at Kyle Field, we 
had 24 bands there, and at the presentations, we

15:21.033 --> 15:30.143
had about 14,000, 15,000 people to see it. So the 
Aggie Band performed just as an exhibition thing,

15:30.243 --> 15:36.069
and they've been having it ever since. That was in 
1988, the first one was held at A&M. And that was

15:40.829 --> 15:43.557
quite an experience for everybody. And so the 
military bands in the high schools are still

15:43.939 --> 15:47.209
going. They're very strong in East Texas. And 
you'll see them scattered around, but in East

15:49.696 --> 15:54.130
Texas, they're very, very strong. they're still 
having that contest although they can't have it

15:54.886 --> 16:15.949
here anymore because of the grass field they won't 
let them have it on the grass so let's see for trivia

15:54.886 --> 16:15.949
what was your pay that beginning year that first 
year at hemp hill the first year i taught school at

15:54.886 --> 16:15.949
hemp hill i made twenty four hundred dollars for 
the first year And most of them want to make that now

16:15.929 --> 16:20.708
the first week. But that's all I had. And with my 
first paycheck, I bought me a horse. And I had money

16:27.168 --> 16:29.310
in the bank. And I had a car and a set of golf clubs. 
And I saved money. So things were a lot different

16:33.715 --> 16:35.778
then. But that was the basic pay for all teachers in 
1950. And that's what I received was the base pay.

16:46.430 --> 16:52.437
And they moved a school building into Hemphill. 
And they had no horns. They had no uniforms. They

16:58.584 --> 16:59.585
had no music. And the superintendent said, I'm 
going to give you $2,000 and you just buy all them

17:00.586 --> 17:07.615
horns you need. And so we had to make a few 
adjustments. But I have pictures of the band. I

17:14.823 --> 17:17.647
started the first concert we played at the end of 
the year. We had 54 and they all had on uniforms.

17:20.290 --> 17:22.353
That was quite an experience too. I've had some 
marvelous experiences with bands. Now as you got

17:26.179 --> 17:36.595
closer to here, reach back and describe Colonel 
Adams as a person and his style and manner. Colonel

17:37.823 --> 17:56.811
Adams and I hunted quail for years and years and he 
always seemed very interested in me personally

17:37.823 --> 17:56.811
and my band personally and he would come to the 
marching contest and see us and he was very very

17:57.854 --> 18:26.123
strict with his uh his his marching cadence and he 
the Aggie band marches 104 steps per minute and he

17:57.854 --> 18:26.123
liked he liked for the bands to be slower and I do too 
I did too we marched about 112 in my high school but

17:57.854 --> 18:26.123
for instance the the normal cadence of review was 
120. and so when I came here That was the cadence

18:26.103 --> 18:31.333
that they were using strictly because it was Army 
regulations. Well, Colonel Tom Parsons and I,

18:31.353 --> 18:40.972
there was always a conflag between the Corps and 
the band because of the faster cadence. So I went to

18:41.032 --> 18:44.078
see him one day and said, now there's no uh... 
provisions anywhere for somebody wearing senior

18:44.648 --> 19:13.626
boots they cannot march a hundred and twenty and so 
we we cut it to a hundred and twelve and it's made the

18:44.648 --> 19:13.626
review so much better and they're still doing that 
but colonel adams was a very strict man he was uh...

18:44.648 --> 19:13.626
uh... he he was a a very fair man and uh... he was 
certainly an honest man and uh... he did a he did a

18:44.648 --> 19:13.626
fine job with this with the aggie band they uh... 
and and all of the men uh... appeared to like him

19:13.606 --> 19:42.634
very very much and he was a very popular person I 
think he was here for twenty seven years and I think

19:13.606 --> 19:42.634
I was the third band director full time band 
director that they had in the history of the school

19:13.606 --> 19:42.634
so from nineteen twenty three to nineteen eighty 
nine I believe they had three band directors and

19:13.606 --> 19:42.634
that speaks highly for the job I think and so we We 
would always meet, Colonel Adams and I and Mary and

19:42.614 --> 19:50.606
his wife Belle. We'd meet at the TBA, the Texas Band 
Marital Association. We'd go out to eat. So we were

19:55.754 --> 20:03.205
very, very close friends for I guess 20 years 
before I came to A&M. And he ran a tight ship, I'll

20:03.185 --> 20:09.422
tell you that for sure. And everybody conformed to 
his way of doing it. And his way was the good way,

20:13.713 --> 20:18.747
because they were very successful in what they 
did. And so I was, our relationship was very, very

20:18.727 --> 20:29.464
good, and we really loved to hunt birds together. I 
wrote, he called me in about 1968, and he said, I

20:30.025 --> 20:38.479
want you to do something for me. And I said, well, 
certainly I'll do something for you. He said, I

20:40.202 --> 20:44.869
want you to rewrite The Spirit of Aggieland. And I 
said, rewrite it or rearrange it? He said, I want

20:48.626 --> 20:50.227
you to rearrange it. He said, we are playing 
against Texas Tech, Texas, some of those big

20:50.788 --> 21:06.987
bands, and this is the arrangement that was 
written in 1923 by Colonel Dunn, and it's got to be

20:50.788 --> 21:06.987
beefed up. And I said, well, let me try it and see 
what happens. When I received the arrangement

21:12.457 --> 21:16.448
they had, well most of it was in two-part harmony. 
So that was the first thing we corrected. We put it

21:21.382 --> 21:28.120
in three-part harmony and what we wanted was to get 
the same idea, but a much bigger, fuller sound. And

21:34.945 --> 21:42.554
he said, between the yell and the last strain, I 
want you to put in a little trumpeting thing,

21:34.945 --> 21:42.554
something different. He said, we just sit there 
and we just play. And you'd have to know him to

21:45.457 --> 21:47.780
really understand it. I said, well, I think I have 
an idea what you mean. So anyway, I wrote the

21:50.243 --> 21:52.686
arrangement. And I played it with my band, and it 
sounded real good to me. So anyway, I sent it to him.

21:58.053 --> 22:24.347
and I didn't hear him that was in the summer of 68 I 
did not hear anything from him and I said well I

21:58.053 --> 22:24.347
guess I guess he didn't like it I guess uh uh he 
didn't he didn't want to use it and I was playing

21:58.053 --> 22:24.347
golf one Saturday at in my hair with my friends and 
one of them just died in a little lag he had his radio

21:58.053 --> 22:24.347
on he's listening to the game between shots and I 
heard this this bugling that I put in there, and I

22:24.665 --> 22:31.259
said, my goodness, he's used that arrangement. 
And they have been playing it now since 1968, and

22:31.279 --> 22:35.528
that's 20, what? 30. 31 years. And they're still 
playing that thing. So he called me back again, and

22:41.675 --> 22:45.999
he said, well, that was good. He said, I've got to 
have something with a little pep in it. He said,

22:49.643 --> 22:58.252
we've got nothing but marches and no, I need 
something with some pep. So anyway, I wrote him a

22:58.272 --> 23:01.275
song. And we were walking along one day, and he 
said, have you ever heard Step to the Rear? We were

23:08.482 --> 23:09.323
hunting. I said, yes, I have. So we walked another 
100 yards, and we sat down on a rock, and he said,

23:10.784 --> 23:18.013
have you ever heard Hey, Look Me Over? I said, yes, I 
have. He said, well, then when you write that song,

23:20.296 --> 23:26.003
I want it to be somewhere between Step to the Rear 
and Hey, Look Me Over. I said, well, okay, I think I

23:26.063 --> 23:28.206
know what you mean. So I wrote this tune. I called it 
Gig'Em. And he said, well, you want to name it that?

23:36.152 --> 23:37.695
I said, well, whatever you want to name it. I just 
thought that'd be a good one. So that's what they

23:39.799 --> 23:40.881
named it. And he put it on his album that he made that 
fall. And we played that up until just a few years

23:45.210 --> 23:47.694
ago. And now we don't play that anymore. But 
anyway, those were the two songs that I gave him. he

23:54.828 --> 24:13.562
said well he called me once i want to pay you for 
those i said i don't want any money for those

23:54.828 --> 24:13.562
because that's something i just want to do and he 
said well i'll either give you money or a bird dog i

23:54.828 --> 24:13.562
said well give me a bird dog because then you give me 
money i'll just spend it so i got a bird dog had the

23:54.828 --> 24:13.562
dog 11 years and he was really good So, you know, I 
think we had a real fine relationship before I came

24:13.542 --> 24:28.564
to A&M, and the fact I think that, well, there's no 
question in anybody's mind, if he had not wanted

24:13.542 --> 24:28.564
me, I would not be there. Now where did he do his 
training and preparation? He went to Texas A&M and

24:34.343 --> 24:46.848
he got his degree there, and then he went to 
Vandercook, the same place that Jay Brewer, the

24:34.343 --> 24:46.848
associate director now, went to get a music 
degree. I think it's in Chicago. And he was a high

24:49.233 --> 24:51.156
school band director. He was at Paris, I think, one 
year, and then I think he was down at Humber one

24:51.697 --> 24:55.744
year. I believe he was. And then at that time, if 
you'll remember, it was mandatory that you

24:58.269 --> 25:06.804
retired at 65. And that's the only reason he 
retired. And so, you know, I was just 43. 44 or

25:13.837 --> 25:20.309
whatever I was, 44, 45, and I had no earthly desire 
to retire. And so then this seemed like the thing to

25:21.331 --> 25:31.590
do to me, and

25:21.331 --> 25:31.590
we had a great 17 years. I just wouldn't take 
anything for it. When you arrived, describe the

25:35.420 --> 25:44.505
facilities for the band in terms of practice and 
instruments that the institution owned. All

25:44.525 --> 25:44.906
right. They had just built a new band hall. one that 
they have now it's called the E.V. Adams Band

25:50.823 --> 26:16.564
Building and it was an excellent facility except 
it had Rogers in it at that time and it was really too

25:50.823 --> 26:16.564
small for uh after the the second the first year I 
was here we had close to 300 then after that we had

25:50.823 --> 26:16.564
300 for a long time and before that they they uh 
practiced in dorm 11 and they had one of the walls

25:50.823 --> 26:16.564
knocked so they just had They had two walls. That's 
where they practiced on the fourth floor of dorm

26:17.788 --> 26:20.298
11. And so the facility was fine. there was a i 
believe when i came here in 72 there were about 15

26:24.188 --> 26:49.960
000 people at a m and i believe we had about three 
four thousand girls i'm not sure i'm don't quote me

26:24.188 --> 26:49.960
on that i think that's about right but there was a 
real need for some additional instrumental music

26:24.188 --> 26:49.960
uh That was one of the first things that I 
encountered when I came, all these people I'd

26:50.480 --> 26:57.128
never heard of, and I couldn't do anything. I just 
didn't even know, barely knew how to get to the band

26:57.228 --> 27:01.193
hall. But they wanted some instrumental music. 
And so the only instrumental group that they had

27:06.179 --> 27:12.426
was the Aggie band on that campus. And I started the 
first year I was there, I started an Aggie concert

27:13.488 --> 27:18.934
band which they had not had. And I also revived the 
Aggieland Orchestra, which is a big dance band.

27:27.326 --> 27:32.077
And so these people began to come see me. And being 
an old music educator, I could see that they really

27:32.337 --> 27:38.391
had a legitimate reason to want to do it. They just 
wanted to play. They had nowhere to go. There were

27:43.456 --> 27:54.227
four Allstate bassoon players on the campus at 
that time and just, they were meeting secretly and

27:43.456 --> 27:54.227
doing a bunch of stuff and I could see a bunch of 
trouble coming. So I went to see my boss in 19, I

27:55.188 --> 28:07.180
believe it was in 73 was John Coldis and I went to 
visit with John. And then he sent me to see Dr.

28:07.160 --> 28:11.186
Williams. And we all agreed that we needed 
something to take the pressure off of them because

28:13.009 --> 28:24.848
anybody that was in the Aggie band had to be in the 
Corps. Okay. So they gave me permission to start a

28:27.982 --> 28:36.116
university symphonic band, which I did. And we 
called it the Texas A&M University Symphonic

28:37.459 --> 28:43.990
Band. And I hired a guy named Joe McMullen, he was 
going to do that, and I was going to continue with

28:44.511 --> 28:50.721
the Aggieland Orchestra. So then we had And then 
the drumming bugle corps, we put them on a very

28:51.743 --> 29:00.236
impressive rehearsal schedule. You can monitor 
them a little more closely. So then all of a sudden

29:01.999 --> 29:03.801
we had five groups. And this was not acceptable by 
some of the Aggie band members at first. They

29:10.551 --> 29:12.615
thought I was a traitor or something. I don't know 
what they thought. But after they could see what

29:13.556 --> 29:18.223
was going on, a lot of them played in it and it's 
still going. And last year they took a tour to

29:18.845 --> 29:26.333
Ireland and I think next year they're going to 
Europe somewhere. But anyway this in no way

29:27.254 --> 29:41.088
interfered with the functions of the Aggie band 
and if anything it took a lot of pressure off saying

29:27.254 --> 29:41.088
that's the only band you have out in the place. No it 
isn't here. So anyway, it worked out real good. And

29:45.554 --> 29:52.805
so the facilities and everything was just fine. 
And the band hall was excellent and had the field

29:53.025 --> 29:57.171
right there. And all the guys lived right there in 
the dorm. And no one could ever ask for a better band

29:59.775 --> 30:03.941
situation than that anywhere in the world. And 
when you arrived, you didn't have to put out any

30:04.322 --> 30:08.548
fires. Nothing was broken. There was a smooth 
transition. As far as I, yes. Yes, you could say

30:15.175 --> 30:17.207
that. There's no... Because I did not come here to 
change the Aggie band. And in your opinion, or no

30:23.267 --> 30:29.033
one else's opinion, did it need any changes? No. It 
was continuity. That was the one thing that we made

30:30.795 --> 30:40.265
clear, and it happened, that I didn't come here to 
make waves or change anything. And you know when

30:40.886 --> 30:46.952
you're up there close to number one and you don't do 
well, there's not one way you can go. Now you're

30:47.523 --> 30:50.427
talking about pressure on a little old fellow, a 
little country boy. I had pressure. And so of

30:52.910 --> 30:58.719
course nobody, everybody thought it was going to 
the dogs and it didn't. And we increased the

30:58.739 --> 31:09.193
numbers and the main thing we did was improve on the 
playing. and more variety of music. We passed out,

31:12.418 --> 31:16.563
I think the second year, by the second year we'd 
pass out 45 tunes. We'd have short versions for

31:17.505 --> 31:20.529
variety. And for the first time ever though, you 
know, you don't want to really, you do something

31:20.749 --> 31:30.543
different and not really change anything. And one 
of the greatest experiences I think I had, I wrote a
