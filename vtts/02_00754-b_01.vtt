WEBVTT

00:01.769 --> 00:03.631
attitude of people.

00:06.535 --> 00:27.220
One of the recollections I have, and one of the 
funny meetings we had, former students, we used to

00:06.535 --> 00:27.220
have our annual meeting up in the YMCA Chapel, 
before the Student Center was built, and we

00:06.535 --> 00:27.220
proposed as an objective of the development fund, 
the golf course.

00:29.967 --> 00:36.737
Well, man, if we had opposed adultery, we could 
have turned up a hornet's nest. All these old

00:36.757 --> 00:40.182
timers, the silliest thing I ever heard of. Expect 
students to get out there and hit that silly ball

00:41.584 --> 00:45.630
right in the ground out there. An old man got up and 
said, our milk counts down there 25 cents an hour,

00:46.752 --> 00:56.146
and I'd all propose to be a part of anything as 
frivolous as a golf course. But the younger ones

00:56.807 --> 00:58.810
prevailed. And, uh, but now that wouldn't, uh, 
that wouldn't frighten anybody about a golf

00:59.330 --> 01:06.258
course. They would take a thing about it. Spending 
a lot of money on a golf course right now. Yeah.

01:15.367 --> 01:22.395
Um, I believe also you were involved in, in 
starting of the, uh, Opportunity Award

01:15.367 --> 01:22.395
Scholarship Fund. Yeah, we started that. What, 
uh, how did that happen to come about? Well, of

01:29.114 --> 01:56.708
course, we'd operated a loan fund through the 
years, but it had

01:29.114 --> 01:56.708
become increasingly difficult to finance enough 
through the loan fund, so we hit on the idea of

01:29.114 --> 01:56.708
combining a job with a scholarship,

01:29.114 --> 01:56.708
which was designed to give a student about 
two-thirds of the year's cost, and then he had to

01:57.127 --> 02:01.413
get the rest of it from home or summer employment. 
And we just hit on the name, Opportunity of War. So

02:06.240 --> 02:15.833
when a boy was selected to get one, he was also 
guaranteed a job, mostly in the mess hall. It goes

02:17.395 --> 02:18.236
through the years. Mess hall waiters, that job was 
the tops of all the student jobs. I don't think, I

02:27.940 --> 02:31.025
don't even have to miss all the waiters anymore. 
Well, they're more busboys than they are waiters

02:31.967 --> 02:34.411
now, I believe. Yeah, but in those days, that was 
the top job on the campus, and it paid so much a month

02:34.431 --> 02:45.489
and board. So it was, and they would set aside a 
certain number of these jobs for opportunity

02:47.432 --> 02:53.121
award winners. So it was a case in which the college 
and the association were working together.

02:59.174 --> 02:59.995
Working together, yeah. The college would 
provide a job, and then you would provide some

03:00.015 --> 03:05.104
supplementary money for them. How much did you 
provide for each student in the beginning, do you

03:05.264 --> 03:08.970
remember? $250. That was for a year or for a 
semester? That was for a year. In that time, we

03:13.938 --> 03:18.265
figured a student could go a year for about $1,000. 
He couldn't own an automobile and live in an

03:18.802 --> 03:25.271
apartment, but he could go to school. Well, I 
imagine at that point there weren't very many of

03:25.291 --> 03:28.556
them who had automobiles. Well, I don't think we'd 
have ever given one an opportunity award if he had

03:29.697 --> 03:34.584
an automobile. He wouldn't have needed one, would 
he?

03:43.216 --> 03:43.336
Uh-uh. Let's see.

03:46.841 --> 03:47.442
What... We mentioned, talked a bit earlier about 
this, the annual giving program evolving into the

03:47.978 --> 03:54.747
development fund.

03:58.972 --> 04:03.918
What kind of originally or initially was the 
purpose of the development fund?

04:08.064 --> 04:15.353
Well, basically to have some money to give to the 
college for purposes that they needed but which

04:15.974 --> 04:44.293
state funds were not available of course the 
state's gotten very liberal these days as far as

04:15.974 --> 04:44.293
they used to have riders on that appropriation you 
couldn't spend any money for a golf course or you

04:15.974 --> 04:44.293
couldn't spend any money for uh this that or the 
other now apparently they can spend money for

04:15.974 --> 04:44.293
anything well there's still a lot of things which 
you can't take money from uh but uh so it actually it

04:15.974 --> 04:44.293
was it was uh The association then sort of set up a 
separate fund. Well, we had to take our expenses

04:51.335 --> 04:55.601
out of that fund. Well, just like when we started 
with the student union. I don't know that we had any

05:04.214 --> 05:08.340
idea how much it cost when we started it. But it was 
something that the college needed. Most schools

05:11.044 --> 05:12.987
had them by that time. They were pretty big. Now 
they're so accustomed, everybody's so

05:14.189 --> 05:17.435
accustomed to it, they don't make anything. And we 
were ambitious like everybody else. Now what I was

05:24.287 --> 05:28.675
getting at is you had the annual giving program. 
and you discontinued the membership dues. We

05:31.951 --> 05:33.352
discontinued the dues, yeah. And you had the 
annual giving program. So I was wondering, did you

05:35.454 --> 05:40.678
then just take all the money you got in and put it 
into the development fund? Yeah, yeah. That's all

05:41.759 --> 05:42.980
the income we had. Oh, we had a few investments.

05:49.026 --> 05:51.588
We had some endowment funds, not many, not much. 
And advertising in the Texas Aggie, a few

05:52.789 --> 05:58.594
miscellaneous sources. So I was misled. I thought 
perhaps you had a special fundraising effort to

06:03.183 --> 06:11.531
create the development fund. No, no, we just made 
the change and started soliciting on a different

06:12.072 --> 06:22.983
basis and it worked out all right. And then By 1947, 
it apparently had devolved to it enough of a

06:25.945 --> 06:42.582
program in which, well, I guess even before that, 
because you succeeded Henderson Shuffler as the

06:25.945 --> 06:42.582
executive director of the development fund. 
Yeah, yeah. And also the executive director of

06:44.344 --> 06:47.628
special gifts and bequests. Yeah. This was for the 
college, or was it still for the Association of

06:47.768 --> 06:53.734
Former Students? Well, for the college, yeah. So 
then the college got money for the development

06:57.215 --> 07:04.185
fund as well as the Association of Former 
Students? Well, we got into, I guess, a

07:04.205 --> 07:10.915
little difficulty on the name. The association 
had called their money raising efforts the

07:12.377 --> 07:15.782
development fund. And then when we set up the 
college office, and we were instrumental in

07:17.044 --> 07:26.057
setting that up, talking them into... put the man 
in there and seek special gifts for the college.

07:32.078 --> 07:33.440
They called that the development fund. It was 
supposed to seek these special gifts and

07:33.520 --> 07:37.206
bequests, things of that sort. And worked real 
closely with the former student association.

07:42.393 --> 07:45.898
Well, somewhere, I don't believe the former 
students call theirs the development fund

07:42.393 --> 07:45.898
anymore. I think they call that other office the 
development program. That's Bob Walker's office

07:49.463 --> 07:53.930
now. And former students call theirs annual 
giving. But there was a confusion there as to

07:57.256 --> 08:04.127
names.

08:04.147 --> 08:14.804
So then the development fund of which you were 
executive director was separated from the former

08:04.147 --> 08:14.804
students by the time you were involved in it. And 
then that was to, was that for, say, if a professor

08:16.406 --> 08:22.656
had a research project you would assist him in 
obtaining funding, or did you assist only college

08:23.159 --> 08:31.830
programs in obtaining funding? Well, we hadn't 
gotten into assisting the individual research

08:32.171 --> 08:38.199
program. That was done by the dean and other 
people. Mostly, the effort was to get bequests

08:43.286 --> 08:51.276
and, oh, industrial grants and things of that 
sort. This would be an industrial grant for a

08:52.792 --> 08:58.900
department or for a college rather than an 
individual researcher. The college has a lot of

08:58.920 --> 09:02.725
scholarship funds. I say a lot, I don't know what it 
would total of, but it is a hell of a lot of

09:02.946 --> 09:07.652
individual scholarships. And we'd always made a 
point of maintaining the integrity of each one of

09:09.014 --> 09:18.026
those funds, so the administration of them became 
quite a chore. And that was under this office.

09:22.930 --> 09:25.713
Now I believe Bob Logan handles that. I'm not sure 
whether they're divided or not. Maybe not. I don't

09:28.516 --> 09:29.897
know. I kind of believe Logan has the scholarship. 
Bob Logan is director of student financial aid.

09:34.842 --> 09:40.909
And all of that used to be under the development 
office.

09:40.929 --> 09:41.890
It ground me down. Well, yeah. I believe what? You 
probably had a committee that helped you decide

09:45.754 --> 09:48.457
who had what scholarship. We had a scholarship 
committee. And we had a general supervisory

09:49.478 --> 09:52.701
committee. Development Board, we called it. Um, 
what kind of, what relationship was there, say,

09:57.665 --> 10:13.571
between the, the Development Fund or Development 
Board and the Research Foundation, which started

09:57.665 --> 10:13.571
in the mid-40s? Well, none. None amounted thing. I 
mean, there was no, there was no, uh, difference

10:20.423 --> 10:21.724
between them. I mean, there was no opposition. Did 
you sometimes find yourself competing against

10:24.207 --> 10:27.990
each other for the same money? I don't think so, 
really. We weren't competing that strongly. You

10:33.536 --> 10:34.617
mean the development fund? Yeah. And

10:35.097 --> 10:50.312
later on, I know some of the college people, the 
university people, felt like that we, maybe

10:35.097 --> 10:50.312
they've solved it now, that we ought to have a 
central office so that there would be no

10:35.097 --> 10:50.312
competition. I never, I never think it's 
worthwhile, because you gotta set up a central

10:51.372 --> 11:18.983
office, then you gotta have another strata of 
executives, one thing or another, and these

10:51.372 --> 11:18.983
people you're seeking money for, from,

10:51.372 --> 11:18.983
well, take one of the instances, you say, well, 
suppose Fred Benson goes to the Elmwood Company

10:51.372 --> 11:18.983
and asks for some money, and the next day, Donald 
Lindsay goes in there and asks them, I don't know

11:19.975 --> 11:22.898
what they're going to think. And my position was, 
we don't care what they think. They probably

11:28.863 --> 11:30.505
think, boy, they're after it. And I said, they can 
say no just as easy as anybody in the world, and they

11:31.326 --> 11:37.992
don't bother them a damn bit. And I don't think it 
ought to embarrass us. But that's just one of those

11:40.855 --> 11:46.320
things that's bound to continue to occur. Well, 
there is a central office of university research

11:47.768 --> 11:53.814
now in the vice president for academic affairs 
office. Yeah, that's probably. And that's a

11:57.398 --> 12:02.624
replacement for what was Dr. Suttles' vice 
president for research. But I don't fully

12:04.946 --> 12:15.398
understand whether, say, something that's 
funneled through the research foundation,

12:04.946 --> 12:15.398
whether that goes through the university 
research office or not. I don't know either. But

12:18.127 --> 12:25.478
anyway, there is more of a central office now than 
there was in the past, anyway. But I'm not so sure

12:26.880 --> 12:41.781
how much cooperation there is, say, between Dr. 
Berg, whose Office of University Research, and

12:26.880 --> 12:41.781
Bob Walker's Development Fund. Well, I don't know 
either. I don't know. Bob, I would guess, was

12:48.383 --> 13:15.707
devoting most of his time to what I call special 
gifts, big quests, and somebody wants to give

12:48.383 --> 13:15.707
$50,000 to start a memorial fund or something of 
that sort, whereas this other officer would be

12:48.383 --> 13:15.707
more interested in research.

13:18.421 --> 13:24.669
I've asked you about a number of specific things 
that were accomplished while you were with the

13:18.421 --> 13:24.669
Association of Farmer Students. Are there some 
other things that were accomplished that you'd

13:25.971 --> 13:28.955
like to talk about? You talked a little bit about 
mentioning the golf course, and that was one I had

13:29.015 --> 13:33.661
not asked you about. You were there for quite a long 
while, and I know a lot of things happened.

13:43.334 --> 13:44.395
I don't know.

13:46.805 --> 13:52.372
Of course, they've had through the years various 
objectives of the development fund. I don't

13:52.392 --> 13:56.536
recall all of them. I think those were the 
groundbreaking ones right there that we

13:56.556 --> 14:05.867
mentioned.

14:06.188 --> 14:12.475
I believe, of course, one of the other things which 
developed while you were either, well, this would

14:12.860 --> 14:18.629
have been while you were with the development 
fund, and that was the construction of the All

14:12.860 --> 14:18.629
Faiths Chapel. You were involved, I guess, in the 
raising of funds for that.

14:30.987 --> 14:36.936
Was All Faiths a replacement for Guyon Hall as a 
place of worship? I don't recall that it was,

14:38.879 --> 14:42.124
particularly. that was,

14:42.712 --> 14:49.340
it just sounded like a pretty good objective. 
Well, I guess even by that time, there was no, there

14:49.360 --> 14:58.430
was, well, even at that time, I guess there was 
really no worship service in Guyon Hall anymore on

14:49.360 --> 14:58.430
Sunday morning. I don't think so. With all of the 
local churches around. I think Guyon Hall had

15:01.754 --> 15:07.420
outlived its usefulness really, I guess. Picture 
shows. It was more of a social gathering place, a

15:13.287 --> 15:19.621
place of entertainment than a place of worship. Of 
course commencement was held there.

15:37.741 --> 15:43.587
I believe at one point you served a year's term as 
president of the American Alumni Council. That

15:43.647 --> 15:52.396
was a position of, I suppose, a considerable 
amount of responsibility, but a considerable

15:43.647 --> 15:52.396
amount of honor too, was it not? Well, mostly 
honor. Mostly honor. Mostly honor. The council

15:56.500 --> 16:04.288
had and has an office in Washington, and the 
president has to, but they have district

16:04.893 --> 16:06.275
meetings. He makes each one of those district 
meetings. I had a couple of board meetings here,

16:09.759 --> 16:14.845
but it's mostly an honor, really, I guess. So the 
council then has, what, an executive director of

16:14.865 --> 16:20.372
its own that does most of the office? Yeah, it's a 
day-to-day business. What sort of services does

16:21.553 --> 16:31.305
the executive office of the Alumni Council 
provide to individual alumni organizations? Oh,

16:32.180 --> 16:51.775
they have publications, and they put on these 
district meetings, and they put on an annual

16:32.180 --> 16:51.775
conference,

16:32.180 --> 16:51.775
and they maintain a library on alumni work, and

16:32.180 --> 16:51.775
that's Mostly it. I presume you say the executive 
director's office sort of puts on the annual

16:53.363 --> 17:07.284
meeting at which people from the various alumni 
organizations attend. They then, I presume, are

17:09.206 --> 17:17.539
responsible for the executive director's office 
would be responsible for the program at which you

17:09.206 --> 17:17.539
get some of the ideas. You come back to them. That's 
right, yeah. Of course, they always name some.

17:21.775 --> 17:29.624
alumni secretary as director of the annual 
conference, but the office does the work. The

17:29.644 --> 17:30.305
office does the work. Would it be somebody in the 
vicinity? Yeah, somebody in the vicinity.

17:35.230 --> 17:35.911
There's a host. Somebody acts as a host of the 
speaker. Yeah, yeah. Did that group ever meet

17:39.855 --> 17:41.017
here? No, no, never have met in Texas. The only time 
I met

17:45.001 --> 17:51.208
was Gulfport one year, as close as I recall.

17:54.277 --> 17:59.604
Well, maybe that'll be something for us to strive 
for for the centennial year. Well, they meet in the

17:59.625 --> 18:06.094
summer, and I wouldn't want anybody to come to 
Texas this summer. Most people don't want to come

18:06.214 --> 18:10.440
to East Texas in the summertime. That's right.

18:16.328 --> 18:22.056
To have these national conferences of the 
American Alumni Council, I'd go to the board and

18:16.328 --> 18:22.056
ask for or expenses to make the trip, travel 
expenses. And I've made several of them. And I

18:29.256 --> 18:34.000
remember one year, I had a board meeting. I said, I 
want to go to this meeting. I don't remember where

18:35.961 --> 18:36.942
it was. And one crusty old gentleman spoke up. He 
said, well, I said, I vote to provide the expenses

18:41.106 --> 18:47.271
with one provision. He said, don't come back with 
any more of those goddamn big ideas.

18:57.237 --> 19:07.688
So

18:57.237 --> 19:07.688
he was going to defeat your purpose in going before 
you ever left.

19:10.571 --> 19:12.753
And that's where a lot of them came from.

19:18.880 --> 19:24.966
Through the years, Texas A&M and Ohio State have 
had a relationship. I may go back to old Dean

19:27.410 --> 19:33.599
Francis, I don't know, D.W. Williams, just any 
number of Ohio State people here. And I became

19:35.281 --> 19:41.209
acquainted with their alumni program and their 
alumni secretaries. I had a couple of them. And

19:42.872 --> 19:43.613
they were sharp. They were way ahead of anybody 
else in the public school field. So I got a lot of

19:51.303 --> 19:54.548
ideas from them. and other people, of course. 
There's a nice thing about alumni work. You don't

20:01.709 --> 20:06.979
mind copying anybody because you're working in an 
entirely different clientele. You're not going

20:06.999 --> 20:08.882
to compete with anybody. I know one thing I wanted 
to ask you. You mentioned that you picked up this

20:11.146 --> 20:18.780
idea of discontinuing dues and going to an annual 
giving program.

20:20.971 --> 20:25.280
How much of an increase did you have in income? We 
had a substantial increase. I've forgotten how

20:27.024 --> 20:35.442
much, but I think our budget on the dues used to be 
about $25,000 a year or something like that. I

20:35.462 --> 20:39.030
think we doubled that the first year we had the 
annual giving. So there were any number of people

20:40.141 --> 20:50.013
who were happy to pay, who would pay $5 but could 
well afford more, but there really was not an

20:40.141 --> 20:50.013
opportunity. Nobody asked them. So if you give 
them the opportunity to open their purse and give

20:52.856 --> 20:58.823
you more, then they did. I recall one, I think it was 
the first solicitation we sent out, And we got a

21:08.761 --> 21:13.207
check back from a man that I knew personally. He was 
a sort of a hell raiser, a drinker, one thing or

21:14.349 --> 21:19.537
another. It was $500. And the check was sort of 
messed up at one thing or another. It was signed.

21:27.408 --> 21:30.673
And I just couldn't believe what I was looking at. 
So I called him up, and I said, Tommy, we got a check

21:30.953 --> 21:36.321
here for $500. I just want to check with you to be 
sure it's right. He said, you don't think I got

21:39.840 --> 21:41.723
$500? I said, yeah. I thought, you're pretty well 
fixed, man. I said, yeah, I know you got $500.

21:48.054 --> 21:51.120
Knowing you, I didn't know when and where you wrote 
this check. He said, I wrote it in my office. I said,

21:53.464 --> 21:55.527
my God, you're cashing.

21:57.551 --> 21:59.094
Well, that puts you off to a good start. Oh, yeah.
