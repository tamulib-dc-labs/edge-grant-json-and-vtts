00:02.107 --> 00:09.936
The way my daddy talks is the main reason that he 
come over here, because he thought he was running

00:02.107 --> 00:09.936
away from wrong. Because he thinks that people was 
not legal, they were not doing right things. And he

00:15.462 --> 00:19.466
wants his family to get a chance to live right. And 
if anybody made a mistake, well, make it, pay for

00:19.486 --> 00:29.177
it, or see that he admitted that he make, don't make 
somebody else accuse somebody else or make

00:29.495 --> 00:35.160
somebody else pay for the crimes that was 
committed. Like those days, he said, we just can't

00:35.180 --> 00:39.404
live with that. We just couldn't. He said, justice 
have to be justice no matter what. And he said, we

00:44.129 --> 00:45.951
just couldn't take it anymore. We just have to 
stand up around two feet and fight for the rights.

00:50.115 --> 00:55.079
We don't want to know all those things that people 
were doing. Just because the man was big man enough

00:55.099 --> 00:59.063
to come and and attack the girls, and the daddy and 
the mother can't say nothing, just have to stand

00:59.380 --> 01:14.624
there and look, or stay there, and don't you go say 
nothing, because your son will have it, or your

00:59.380 --> 01:14.624
husband will. And you think these things were 
still happening after 1920? No, I don't think that

01:18.449 --> 01:25.320
no more things will happen, because all those 
people that were working for that, They were gone.

01:26.414 --> 01:27.015
They were gone. They were gone because my daddy 
said, we saw the trains. They saw the train that,

01:31.039 --> 01:36.244
you see, they sent a locomotive train. The train 
was packed with soldiers, horses, and all the

01:36.885 --> 01:42.171
equipment. They can think. They put on this train. 
But they had telephone then. I don't know what year

01:47.436 --> 01:49.799
it was, but they had telephone. They give some tip 
off that the train was coming loaded with all those

01:49.919 --> 01:54.784
things. And you know how those mountains are over 
there? Well, they sent a locomotive just with no

01:57.497 --> 02:00.020
driver. Just go meet those trains. And they said 
those trains, they're still there. My daddy said,

02:04.767 --> 02:06.108
there's no doubt. They're still there because 
there's no way nobody can take those. Because

02:09.453 --> 02:12.136
there's what you call a canyon. And they just fall 
out. You can see the crying, the smoke and all that.

02:17.002 --> 02:22.770
And my father-in-law told you that day that he saw 
little babies crawling like little rats all over.

02:23.130 --> 02:23.691
He said they were I don't remember, say, about 50 or 
100 little babies and little kids that they

02:24.110 --> 02:34.187
brought to Sonora and put in an offering. because 
their mothers and daddies got killed in the train

02:34.471 --> 02:39.999
wreck. Well, were their mothers and fathers, were 
their fathers soldiers, or were they refugees?

02:44.626 --> 02:45.668
They were soldiers, too. And their mothers didn't 
want to stay there, so they'd take the kids and

02:46.008 --> 02:49.373
they'd follow them. They were soldaderas. Yeah, 
they were with them. And some of them just lived a

02:52.498 --> 02:58.647
lot of common law and everything, having kids on 
top of the train or on the side of the road. But

02:58.988 --> 03:02.834
anyway, all those people, we just have to forget 
about them. They're just all gone. because my

03:04.087 --> 03:11.937
daddy said, and the few people that, you know, that 
didn't get killed, they want to start this other

03:04.087 --> 03:11.937
mess. But, you know, the other people that had more 
sense, they said, no, we're going to start this. So

03:16.783 --> 03:20.468
most of them flew the country, so they don't 
report. And some of them, a lot of kids got killed.

03:24.173 --> 03:33.064
Most of them got killed, because I know, because we 
were talking about it the other day, that this man

03:24.173 --> 03:33.064
got killed when this man's Like my father-in-law 
and all of them, they come because, you see, there

03:33.415 --> 03:39.382
were a lot of soldiers, you know, still left. They 
had good sense. They said, we're going to put an end

03:41.183 --> 03:46.209
to all these people that started this mess. We're 
going to put a stop. And they put a stop. They did

03:48.331 --> 03:49.813
like a caster. You know, they built a, what you call 
it, a big hole. And they just put them over there.

03:59.443 --> 04:00.344
Then he had no gun. They stabbed him and put him in 
the hole. They have to do that because they say,

04:03.149 --> 04:11.981
then they get out of there and they spread the, you 
know, they're going to spread it and make some more

04:03.149 --> 04:11.981
people think the way they think. And they got 
killed. They did kill. Now, the ones that got

04:13.904 --> 04:18.110
killed, your father-in-law was with Carranza. 
Yes, Carranza. They was, you know, different

04:22.596 --> 04:28.144
generals, I'd say, different generals. But they 
were always the same call, attacking the federal

04:28.462 --> 04:32.823
government. They were attacking the federal 
government The federal government was crooked as

04:35.110 --> 04:40.396
ever because he didn't have no law. They had no 
government. Well, did your father stay with Pablo

04:42.038 --> 04:46.884
Gonzalez the whole time, or did he eventually join 
Villa? No, he joined Villa because Villa and

04:47.424 --> 04:53.611
Gonzalez, they had some partnership. They were 
together part of the time. They were some partners

04:56.675 --> 04:58.257
in some way. I think there's some money. And they 
deal with some money and with some ammunition.

05:04.378 --> 05:05.580
Yeah. I'm trying to remember. I think Pablo 
Gonzalez was under Carranza, wasn't he? And, of

05:10.467 --> 05:13.471
course, Carranza and Villa were on the same side 
for a long time. And then later were against each

05:14.152 --> 05:15.834
other. Did your father actually meet Villa? Yeah. 
How did he describe him? Well, he said he, you know

05:21.042 --> 05:26.329
how people think about another man. My daddy used 
to get up. He's a little man. He used to get up. get up

05:29.363 --> 05:55.405
and say oh he said Villa was a man with the knowledge 
understanding and all that but still and all the

05:29.363 --> 05:55.405
things he did he did wrong now that's the way he put 
it you know when you talk about you know soldier he

05:29.363 --> 05:55.405
start telling us so you know think he he was a good 
man he had a good uh education I think and he had he

05:29.363 --> 05:55.405
thought he had a good knowledge but he's dying he 
died thinking he was doing right, but he was doing

05:55.722 --> 06:04.131
wrong because he come to a place with some girls. He 
messed those girls up without any... He used to be

06:08.476 --> 06:09.818
pretty good about that. Yeah, that's what my daddy 
said. So he said, now, you see, you can't put a good

06:12.421 --> 06:21.310
man to do those things and then tell the nation that 
he was a good man. You can't say that. He thought he

06:22.472 --> 06:23.793
died. He died. thinking that he was doing right, 
but he wasn't doing right. But what did your father

06:27.983 --> 06:30.826
used to say about Pablo Gonzales? Oh, he thought he 
was a good man. He thought he was fighting for the

06:32.588 --> 06:35.031
rights of the people. He thought he was a high 
standard soldier or man. What ever happened to

06:39.756 --> 06:41.978
Pablo Gonzales? I've forgotten. I don't know. You 
know, it's been a long time that I haven't talked to

06:44.601 --> 06:51.649
him, but he knew everything about those men. 
Everything. They had huerta, and some of them were

06:52.986 --> 06:56.149
named huerta. What did he say about huerta? Well, 
you know, they used to send some men to certain

06:58.432 --> 07:04.939
places. They were military men, and they were 
well-disciplined. If you don't obey orders,

07:09.985 --> 07:16.912
well, he'll come and punch those men. And they used 
what you call a sable, like that. and he'll put

07:22.342 --> 07:23.823
somebody to. And if he say, well, execute that man, 
and you know, hit him so many legs, and he don't like

07:25.085 --> 07:33.833
it, well, you have to hit him again. And so that 
teach him a lesson not to disobey the military

07:34.574 --> 07:38.497
order. When they, yes, they send you to somewhere, 
you better go over there and do whatever we ever

07:38.557 --> 07:44.863
say, or else don't come back. You know, that he 
believes in not a military discipline, because he

07:45.724 --> 07:51.049
was a soldier. He knew his work and everything. Now 
what rank did you say you thought he had? Well, he

07:57.352 --> 08:04.900
thought he was, my daddy thought he was fighting 
for the right of the... Oh, what rank? Oh, rank. He

08:06.081 --> 08:06.842
was a captain. He was a captain in the army of Pablo 
Gonzales. Pablo Gonzales, yeah. He was a captain.

08:12.348 --> 08:16.332
And you know, my brother used to laugh because he's 
a little bitter man. He said, oh, this man, he don't

08:16.352 --> 08:18.735
know nothing. And you know, my daddy... Every time 
he tells us something, he says, and that's an

08:21.083 --> 08:23.746
order. And that's an order. And my mother said, 
he's not talking to you as a father. He's talking to

08:28.931 --> 08:30.092
you as a soldier. I was giving you some orders. And 
you know, when he was going to whip us, he said,

08:31.874 --> 08:36.518
y'all look for the belt. And we just looking for the 
belt. He had one, but he wanted us to go and get the

08:39.501 --> 08:45.307
thing for you one to be executed. And after we don't 
find the belt, but he got his. And he just give about

08:48.438 --> 08:53.127
two or three licks, but he'll tell you why and where 
and when. And yeah, he was not kind of a man, he'd go

08:53.588 --> 08:56.815
bang, bang. No, he'll explain to you. I told you not 
to do this. Yes. Why did you do it? Well, something

09:02.586 --> 09:04.409
went wrong. Well, this is to remember not to do it 
again. And boy, Every time Mother said, well, I

09:09.329 --> 09:11.312
won't tell you, Daddy. We were, Mother, don't tell 
him. We know he was going to get it. But he said that

09:17.642 --> 09:26.636
he thought Villa was, in the sense of a soldier, he 
was a good soldier, what you call a good soldier. He

09:27.116 --> 09:29.600
had a good understanding, good knowledge. He 
said, but he was wrong. He was doing wrong.

09:36.042 --> 09:40.188
He got to meet him in person, talk with him, eat with 
him, and everything. Did your father ever talk

09:42.050 --> 09:45.034
about any battles he was in or anything? Yes, he 
said he talks about some of them. And then he talked

09:48.499 --> 09:53.886
about sometimes they were so thirsty, they were so 
hungry. He said, well, sometimes we have to shoot

09:54.227 --> 09:59.394
our own horse and eat it because there was nothing 
else to eat. Yeah, he used to talk about, he said he

09:59.955 --> 10:03.940
don't believe in the word is seen in any good in any 
language because he said he saw a lot of things that

10:04.308 --> 10:32.543
he didn't have to see if they didn't even you know 
think about doing things right he said but uh i saw

10:04.308 --> 10:32.543
some things that boy it just he just don't want to 
think about now that he got an old little man he said

10:04.308 --> 10:32.543
but it was some some tough days that we didn't have 
nothing to eat and then especially when you start

10:04.308 --> 10:32.543
shooting he said you thought we'd get so dry And he 
said, look like you, and you don't know, and you can

10:32.995 --> 10:37.543
see just the fire. And now you can see the fire just 
like a firecracker. And you're just shooting at

10:40.949 --> 10:51.047
nobody because you're shooting just, you don't 
know if that bullet is going to hit you or nothing.

10:51.067 --> 10:55.434
It's just a chance that you're going to take. He 
said sometimes they shoot all night. And see, the

10:58.612 --> 11:04.819
next morning, there'll be some children, but that 
much children. They shouldn't all die. I don't

11:05.659 --> 11:09.263
know how many around. Well, now, so many years 
after the revolution, what kind of place do you

11:09.343 --> 11:14.088
think Mexico is to live? Well, Mexico is, the way I 
went over there, the way it looks, it's all right. I

11:23.358 --> 11:26.982
think Mexico is doing all right. Because I went to 
all these places that I wanted to go. Where all did

11:30.646 --> 11:31.967
you go? I went to all the department stores. I went 
to the stores. I went to the church. In what town? In

11:37.052 --> 11:37.733
Monclova. In Monclova. And they got everything 
that we got. They got everything that we got. They

11:44.139 --> 11:45.440
haven't missed anything. One thing, just one 
thing that I saw, that they should have so many

11:46.941 --> 11:51.726
babies. So many, you know, the families are, the 
couples are real babies. loaded with babies you

11:56.864 --> 12:24.424
know a couple about around 20 25 years old or they 
they already got by six or seven babies you know and

11:56.864 --> 12:24.424
they're so young they look so pretty and the babies 
are real pretty but i think that's where they're i

11:56.864 --> 12:24.424
won't say a mistake but i think that's what they 
need to do some little work you know if they had a

11:56.864 --> 12:24.424
they'd have a more

12:25.163 --> 12:54.563
protection or something like that that we they 
don't have to deal with so many little babies and

12:25.163 --> 12:54.563
that you know sometimes a lot of babies are not are 
not good for the girl for the for the female and

12:25.163 --> 12:54.563
sometimes i don't know i'm not against the babies 
but what it is that they they haven't got any any

12:25.163 --> 12:54.563
well the neighborhood that i went they got no no 
sinks no no tubs like we do no no no nothing like uh

12:54.948 --> 13:05.799
the restrooms is outside and all that, and that 
maybe in the future they're going to, there's some

12:54.948 --> 13:05.799
communities that they already got everything, 
but now these other ones, they are just about

12:54.948 --> 13:05.799
building. They just got a little room like this, 
and a whole eight, nine, or two little kids live

13:05.819 --> 13:16.609
there, and the mom and the dad, and the kitchen and 
everything is the same. Who were you visiting when

13:16.629 --> 13:18.411
you were there? I visited my mom.

13:23.737 --> 13:26.060
My son lost his mom and dad. Your son lost his mother 
and dad? Yeah. And he's from Montclova? Yeah, he's

13:29.966 --> 13:30.988
from Montclova. But you see, well, they well off 
because they got a big brick house bigger than

13:31.008 --> 13:37.117
mine. And it's brand new. They just made it. Now 
they well off. They want the vices. But what I'm

13:43.109 --> 13:48.557
talking about, you know, the other little... You 
went out to some other parts of town. Some other

13:48.657 --> 13:50.400
parts of town. And the streets are not very...

13:55.047 --> 13:56.188
They're not fixed, you know. They just got dirt 
roads and just a lot of rocks and everything and

13:56.228 --> 14:05.202
just a bunch of little kids in the streets and all 
that. But it's the same way as here. But what it is,

14:07.825 --> 14:10.570
they all go to school. That's one thing I've got to 
say. That little boy, little girl, about six,

14:12.607 --> 14:19.493
seven years, he know how to read and write in 
Spanish just like the little kids over here in

14:12.607 --> 14:19.493
English. And they know how to multiply and 
everything. You know, that's what I admired in.

14:24.718 --> 14:36.670
But I still say that, like I told my son-in-law, he 
says that, yeah, I just got two, Mom, and I've been

14:24.718 --> 14:36.670
married about six years, seven years. He said, but 
that's when they got on one, Mom, who liked to have

14:37.290 --> 14:40.433
so many babies. He said, well, because I noticed 
they don't have any. Mm-hmm. Who is your

14:43.626 --> 14:44.708
son-in-law? What religion are you? You're 
Methodist, aren't you? Well, my son-in-law was

14:49.195 --> 14:56.866
Catholic, but until he come and meet my girl over 
here, he become a Methodist. He joined the

14:56.886 --> 14:58.068
Methodist church? He joined the Methodist 
church, and he said he liked it. And then he said he

15:01.113 --> 15:06.861
didn't like to deal with so many babies because he 
said it's hard for the men to support them, baby. He

15:06.901 --> 15:10.727
said that he just don't know how these people 
support those babies. We saw so many, you know, we

15:11.028 --> 15:16.795
went close to Christmas, and they were all out 
there chopping. I don't know how many little

15:16.855 --> 15:19.578
babies. They were about this big, about this big. 
There's like a little letter and another one and

15:21.961 --> 15:25.486
another one away from me. I tell my husband, they 
look pretty, all right. I said, but I hate to be here

15:27.648 --> 15:29.811
with you two. He said, because I just wondered how 
they do to support all those babies. And then my

15:34.597 --> 15:37.641
husband said, well, how did you do with yours? I 
said, yeah, but it was not so mean. I don't know,

15:40.728 --> 15:45.375
maybe they got more tap than we do to support all 
those ladies. And they sleep on the floor, just in

15:46.156 --> 15:52.885
the little rug or something. And they got no 
heaters. I didn't see no heaters over there. I saw a

15:57.552 --> 16:00.476
stove, you know, running with a butane. Everybody 
got butane over there. They believe a lot in

16:02.859 --> 16:04.802
butane. Even in the country, they got butane. But I 
didn't see no heaters. Very few. There are very few

16:11.236 --> 16:13.399
houses heated in Mexico. It used to be that way here 
when we moved to Texas in 1950. Nobody had heat. And

16:19.649 --> 16:21.111
we were worse. I guess you didn't have heat when you 
were growing up in the Brazos Valley. Well, we had a

16:25.778 --> 16:28.583
chimney. You had a fireplace? A fireplace, yeah. 
That's what I was talking about. I said, you know,

16:33.170 --> 16:35.473
we'll be here. It's a lot of different, because we 
have some wood. We have some wood for fireplace. We

16:42.915 --> 16:44.077
have some wood. But I didn't see no heaters, no kind 
in the house. But of course, it's not so cold over

16:49.804 --> 16:53.208
there, neither. No, not as often, anyway. That's 
what I was thinking about. It's not too cold,

16:59.755 --> 17:05.562
neither, because it's just more of the south than 
we do here. But that's why I think that those people

17:06.014 --> 17:11.060
got everything. Everything. I went to look for a 
stanchion like that, and it was there. And the bub

17:16.507 --> 17:19.471
and everything, they showed me everything. And 
they got everything. Paints. I was looking for

17:21.753 --> 17:25.298
some paint, and they showed me the paint and the 
brush and everything. They got everything.

17:26.940 --> 17:27.961
Everything. Do you feel like they have problems 
now with the law and all the kinds of things that

17:28.141 --> 17:35.110
used to happen? No, no, I don't think so because 
those people are more, you know, more aware of the

17:35.427 --> 17:49.806
thing because they know that if anybody do 
something, they get what they coming. They don't

17:49.886 --> 17:53.912
have to pay for the crime they commit. You feel like 
they solve those problems. Yeah, those problems,

17:55.474 --> 17:57.076
yeah. And then this truck had a lot of means that 
they were in penitentiary. And you know, all the

18:04.503 --> 18:11.391
men we got here in Huntsville in the penitentiary, 
well, we didn't have to pay the city nothing. We

18:11.411 --> 18:13.172
bring all those men to clean the city. Over there, 
they brought all the men from penitentiary to

18:13.593 --> 18:16.876
clean the city. And the guards was there. They was 
cleaning all the city. And told my son-in-law, my

18:22.242 --> 18:29.550
husband told my son-in-law, one of those men said 
they from penitentiary. They were different.

18:31.672 --> 18:32.415
with the struts. They were in penitentiary. He 
said, but we don't have to pay no city people. They

18:37.433 --> 18:39.200
don't know, we ain't got no city people. Those are 
the people that come and do the cleaning. Well,

18:41.915 --> 18:43.857
it's kind of the same way in Huntsville. The prison 
guards, I mean, the prisoners in Huntsville do a

18:44.598 --> 18:51.444
lot of the work on the college campus and the parks 
and everything. They do all that over there, too.

18:53.266 --> 18:59.833
Well, you see, what I mean is not that, you know, we 
don't take them out of there to come and clean the

18:53.266 --> 18:59.833
brine. No, not the brine. That's what I meant. But 
they do use them in Huntsville. Yeah, they do their

19:03.316 --> 19:06.339
own cultivation. They grow their own food. That's 
what I heard. I see them working on the field. But

19:13.028 --> 19:16.493
what I meant is that the prisoners don't have to 
come and clean. Clean brine. Clean brine. They

19:18.636 --> 19:23.443
come from over there to the city, to the streets and 
get the garbage. But they do over there. That way

19:27.048 --> 19:30.653
the government is having a little help there. Is 
there a big prison in Monclova? No, I didn't ask

19:32.793 --> 19:40.039
Johnny, but they saw those men and they just said 
that they were people to see. I hope not, but my boy

19:40.340 --> 19:50.168
and a bunch of boys went to Monterey.

19:50.188 --> 19:56.393
They went to the orphan.

19:56.434 --> 20:01.618
They said they had so many little boys, but from 
eight, nine, and ten. Almost the same age. And they

20:06.464 --> 20:30.880
went to the convent to sing for the nuns because the 
Methodist from Dallas, they furnished the bus and

20:06.464 --> 20:30.880
they gave him $700 just to make a trip, you know, to 
let the, what you call the Southwest Comforts to

20:06.464 --> 20:30.880
get involved in Mexico to see what they can work 
over there, develop something or see something or

20:06.464 --> 20:30.880
something. And they went over there, and they were 
very impressed, and they would approach my boy and

20:31.163 --> 20:37.710
say, Mama, you can see all the little boys. They 
ain't got no mommy nor daddy. They were little

20:39.612 --> 20:41.474
boys. But my boys' organization, they're going to 
give $75 each year, which is almost $1,000 over

20:41.494 --> 21:00.495
there, so the little orphan kids can have at least a 
good meal every now and then. Did he find out why

21:01.319 --> 21:03.422
there were so many orphans? No, they didn't talk 
about that. They just said that there were

21:05.826 --> 21:08.450
orphans. The orphans, they took them over there. 
The ministers took them over there to sing and to

21:10.934 --> 21:16.282
learn them to say things in English. And they sing 
in English and Spanish. So they can get something

21:18.585 --> 21:23.553
different from what they've been teaching over 
there. They like it. The little boys like it. And

21:25.696 --> 21:27.018
then they went to the convent. They went to the 
plaza. They went to all the places, you know. They

21:30.817 --> 21:36.807
stayed about a week or so, but my boy said they were 
very impressive. He said the town was good, and the

21:36.827 --> 21:46.204
names were good, and the people were so polite, and 
they liked it. Yeah, I like Monterey. It's a nice

21:47.065 --> 21:48.347
city. Yeah, I like the food. I do like the food very 
much. And I told my husband, I said, I think they got

21:52.895 --> 21:56.301
me. The way they talk, I said, they got law and 
order. I said, ain't nothing wrong. They're just a

22:00.788 --> 22:03.031
lot of people, that's all. There's a lot of Spanish 
people, that's all. In Monclova, 78,000. That's a

22:07.977 --> 22:10.640
pretty good size. Yeah, the population is 78,000. 
You can see miles and miles, and you can see corners

22:12.623 --> 22:18.650
and streets and pools. People, I just see one 
colored boy. And he talk in Spanish. I don't know

22:23.657 --> 22:24.718
what he say. He was sitting at the window, and 
another boy approached him and said the shoes that

22:25.002 --> 22:30.688
were there, he liked that. But he said it in 
Spanish, so I don't know where he comes from. But I

22:34.913 --> 22:39.338
didn't say no one Anglo or nothing else, but just 
Spanish. And I thought, when I saw that color

22:39.358 --> 22:42.382
board, I said, where did he come from? And he showed 
some shoe that he was a bison shoe. It cost about 200

22:46.687 --> 22:50.571
pesos. Now your husband's family came from Mexico 
in 1918. Was your husband born here or there?

22:59.682 --> 22:59.882
There. He was born there. He was born in June 1917. 
And he doesn't really remember coming up here. No,

23:07.371 --> 23:10.034
he was nine months old. And I was less than a year. Me 
too. I don't remember nothing about that. But now I

23:15.341 --> 23:17.443
remember that I took that trip. I remember 
everything good and I'll never forget. Have you

23:20.858 --> 23:22.619
been just the one time? One time. How long ago was 
that? Last year. Last year? Last year, but I went to

23:26.843 --> 23:29.165
Laredo first. I went to Laredo, but I've been taken 
to Crip. And this year I did want to take one, but it

23:32.508 --> 23:38.433
was a time for my vacation, so I couldn't take it. 
And so they went over there, but I'm planning to

23:38.493 --> 23:43.797
take them home to Oklahoma. Yeah, to see your 
parents. Yeah. And your father. My dad, yeah. I

23:46.920 --> 23:48.061
want to see. How did you happen to meet your 
husband? We was living here at the bottom, what you

23:51.284 --> 23:56.936
call the breast of that, the other bottom. And we 
moved to Hillock because this boy was going to

23:56.956 --> 24:03.371
marry my sister. And then he said that they have 
some good houses and good Then maybe my daddy can

24:09.644 --> 24:14.488
make better trade over there than over here. My 
daddy, well, let's go over there. And so my sister

24:18.091 --> 24:22.035
got married, and she had a big wedding. And my 
husband and his brother happened to come to the

24:22.636 --> 24:25.698
wedding. And that's where they, he saw me. I saw 
him, and he saw me. And then about a year later, he

24:32.664 --> 24:39.010
wrote me a letter as I was staying in the state of 
Oklahoma. We were working over there, and I

24:39.293 --> 24:47.463
received a letter from him that he wants to have 
some love affair or something with me. And so I

24:47.803 --> 24:51.608
didn't really think, thought about who he was. I 
said, well, we have a bunch of girls over there, and

24:51.628 --> 24:58.456
all the girls had letters and everything. And they 
said, well, let's sit over here and make a

24:58.936 --> 25:02.360
decision. What should I say? Well, let's say yes 
just for the fun of it. And he didn't even know who he

25:07.745 --> 25:11.229
is. And so I did wrote the letter back, answered the 
letter back. When I come back from the state of

25:14.713 --> 25:21.560
Oklahoma, that I come back to him, he show up. And he 
said that he was the one that wrote me a letter. And

25:23.763 --> 25:25.885
so from there, we started from there. After a year, 
and three months, and three weeks, and a hundred

25:27.227 --> 25:31.872
days, we got back. Did your parents let you 
actually go out on dates? No. No, they didn't

25:36.377 --> 25:37.498
believe in that. No, they don't want the boys to 
come see the girls. They don't want the boys to get

25:41.565 --> 25:44.549
the girls out of the house. We couldn't get out of 
the house. We had a little well about a block or two

25:46.933 --> 25:51.860
from the house. We just have to go get the water from 
the faucet in the back. We traveled back and forth,

25:55.586 --> 25:59.011
of course, to get some water and water all day. But 
that's all we could do. And you made it the well. No,

26:02.536 --> 26:07.063
the boys, they used to have a baseball diamond over 
there. And all the boys and men from the farm get

26:07.330 --> 26:10.795
together over there to play. We just go over there 
and get the water and look. Just about five minutes

26:14.020 --> 26:17.284
and you better come back because you can't stay 
there. No, they were very strict at that point. We

26:21.531 --> 26:22.812
couldn't, we couldn't go out. Well, actually, I 
never did go out with a boy myself one day or one

26:23.413 --> 26:31.345
evening or one night, one hour or so. I used to talk 
to my husband about twice. It was in my

26:33.528 --> 26:34.990
sister-in-law's house. He made a visit over 
there. This other girl happened to take me over

26:37.351 --> 26:41.937
there to work playing the record. And he was there. 
And he said, well, finally I saw Maggie along. And

26:48.384 --> 26:51.108
he talk about, you know, he was older than me. We 
were talking about plants and wedding plants and

26:51.368 --> 26:54.892
all that. And I began to get scared. How old were you 
then? I was about 16. I was just shaking. I said, no,

27:02.001 --> 27:04.324
no, no, no. He said, yes, he said. Go and ask your 
father, you better not come over the house if you

27:05.768 --> 27:12.397
don't want my father to raise him some cane. He 
said, well, then I'll wait. How much will you want

27:14.920 --> 27:17.103
me to wait now? I don't know. And he keep, you know, 
boys, would be boys, he keep, you know, he was 22.

27:25.174 --> 27:32.063
Well, he was 21 then, and he was 22, and then he was 
23. And when Geek got married, he was 24. He was

27:34.761 --> 27:36.504
still waiting all this time. So when you got 
married, you were how old? 17. 17, yeah. And, well,

27:40.790 --> 27:43.273
did he finally come see your father? No, he never 
did come. He was scared. You know, the boys used to

27:45.716 --> 27:48.620
have a lot of respect for that. Well, how did you 
happen to get married? We just eloped. You eloped.

27:53.227 --> 27:53.487
Oh. And just run away. Yeah, just run away. He come 
to my house and at night after a thief and just took

27:58.942 --> 28:28.645
me to his house and then we were the next day the next 
day they they called the minister and you know he

27:58.942 --> 28:28.645
always been a methodist he called the minister and 
said well you have to forgive me i need a wife and i

27:58.942 --> 28:28.645
think i'll look for one and i found it and this is the 
girl no one married and the minister said well

27:58.942 --> 28:28.645
there's nothing wrong we'll get you license and 
and we'll be here tonight to marry you Was it all

28:29.131 --> 28:33.075
right with his parents? They were in on it. They 
were all right because his son had committed a

28:35.398 --> 28:42.826
crime there because he had no business going to 
that house and bringing a girl. But then I was under

28:43.186 --> 28:46.309
age, you know, 17. But he said, well, as long as she 
don't complain, we're not going to say anything.

28:51.715 --> 28:54.218
My daddy didn't complain then because he was mad. 
He said he didn't want to take any part in the

28:54.238 --> 28:58.362
wedding when my husband bought me to town, bought 
me my dress and my everything and the wedding cake

28:58.932 --> 29:11.229
and everything and we just, we were married that 
night. Did your mother and daddy come? No, they

29:12.911 --> 29:15.274
didn't come. How long was it before they came 
around? Five years. Five years? Five years before

29:21.243 --> 29:23.406
they got over? They got over. Five years I had to 
stay away from the house because they didn't want

29:28.497 --> 29:31.806
Because they were Catholics. And they think that 
the Protestants and the Catholics should get

29:32.287 --> 29:43.857
involved because they thought it was a sin. Well, 
we didn't see it that way. We love each other, and we

29:45.799 --> 29:52.147
need each other, and we do care about no religion. 
Well, how about your sisters, though? Did they

29:53.969 --> 29:56.312
have trouble, too, when they got married? No, my 
sister was married to a Catholic man. I see. So one

29:59.096 --> 30:03.461
of the reasons that your father didn't accept your 
husband was the religion. Yeah, but my sister had a

30:03.902 --> 30:06.686
pretty wedding. That's where I got to meet him. My 
husband was this man of... friends and they

30:13.334 --> 30:15.598
invited him to the wedding. We set the table and I 
remember that I had a dress that my mother had made

30:15.618 --> 30:21.327
me. It was a blue, a blue taffeta dress. A lot of, you 
know, shiny, real shiny. I thought I was the queen

30:30.281 --> 30:33.967
because I never did wear one like that. And I was so 
impressed by that dress and I thought I was going

30:34.027 --> 30:38.334
crazy. And then she put some white a collar and a 
little, like a little, she made like a little tie.

30:48.496 --> 30:52.625
And I would just, you know, go in places and then he 
asked the question, who is she? I said, that's the

30:52.705 --> 30:54.830
bride's sister. Oh, well, very interesting. Any 
more sisters around here? She said, no, she's the

30:58.237 --> 30:59.479
only one. Well, we'll get it before the Thank you so 
much. I was just thinking, for a long time, a lot of

31:04.982 --> 31:09.927
parents were pretty strict with their daughters. 
What about now? Is it that way now? Well, some

31:12.990 --> 31:20.358
Spanish men still, but some don't. They already 
find out that, you know, like me and my husband said

31:20.418 --> 31:29.427
this way when we got married, if we ever get having 
any family, We're not going to be a sire because

31:30.419 --> 31:33.563
they were hard on us. We enjoy the life. We're just 
working and not enjoying. We can go to the dance. We

31:40.612 --> 31:41.634
can go to the movie. We can go to church. We can go 
nothing. Nowhere. You stay there like an old maid

31:45.539 --> 31:50.706
at the age of 16 or 17. And my husband said, yes, 
we're never going to be with the girls. Now my

31:54.491 --> 31:57.034
oldest daughter got married at 22. And we didn't 
have no problem. And she didn't go out. She didn't

32:00.462 --> 32:01.183
go out. I've got one over there. She's 21, and she 
don't go out. And we didn't tell her not to go out. I

32:08.713 --> 32:12.758
tell my husband, well, I don't know what happened. 
I said, I got my other girl. She's 15. She don't go

32:16.063 --> 32:17.204
out with boys. And she's 21. And I said, I haven't 
seen a boy, you know, framed and running around or

32:18.386 --> 32:23.873
asking for a date or nothing. And she said, I don't 
know. I tell my husband, how about us? We were just

32:29.122 --> 32:32.127
tied to a tree. And I said, I didn't tie my girls. I 
said, well, y'all go and see the world and make your

32:35.533 --> 32:42.805
own decisions and work and have a good time, have a 
lot of fun with people. My kids are going to church.

32:45.830 --> 32:51.800
They go to the meetings, to the church, to the 
service, to sing here and there and over there and

32:45.830 --> 32:51.800
anywhere. It's not one thing. That one, Joseph, 
she went to that racetrack yesterday and walked 20

32:53.377 --> 32:56.881
miles. Yes, bless her heart. She was limping. Yes, 
she's got burns all over here. Is she the one that's

33:01.906 --> 33:02.947
21? Mm-hmm. She's 21, I said, and I tell my husband, 
I say, and she's having a lot of fun. That car is

33:10.635 --> 33:15.200
hers, and she worked, and she paid her car. And 
where is she working now? Coca-Cola. At the

33:17.442 --> 33:21.447
Coca-Cola, yeah. Before that, she worked 
somewhere. with me over there when she was in high

33:23.077 --> 33:25.880
school. She was about 14. She always thought about 
buying a car. She bought that car and she's paying

33:33.028 --> 33:36.812
for it. She's having a lot of friends, a lot of 
girls, and of course a lot of boys too. But I don't

33:42.759 --> 33:48.085
see that, you know, he attached to one boy and go out 
with him running around with that boy. I said,

33:48.105 --> 33:52.569
well, maybe it's her nature or maybe she's, I don't 
know. She just on the quiet side of the family, or I

33:53.806 --> 33:56.328
don't know. And sometimes I go, when is she going to 
get married? I say, I think she's going to marry

33:59.031 --> 34:02.674
when you're 24. When she's 24. But

34:04.496 --> 34:10.221
I think we are doing all right. If we get to leave to 
January the 21st, we'll be married 31 years. 31

34:15.305 --> 34:15.806
years. 31 years in the month. I was talking to the 
lady that I work. She said, I'll be married to my

34:20.270 --> 34:22.952
husband 55. 55 years. I said, well, and another 
girl, they don't know me. He said, I thought you was

34:27.402 --> 34:29.486
not married that long. I said, well, 31 years, you 
think it's not long? I said, I don't think he's not

34:31.850 --> 34:33.754
here. I said, I think I can do another 31 real easy. 
He said, you mean your husband took a trip to Mexico

34:36.799 --> 34:41.167
and you didn't go? I said, no. I trusted him a lot. I 
said, and said, he will come back. They called this

34:46.332 --> 34:47.254
morning. They're leaving Tuesday. They're 
leaving from Oklahoma. I said, he will come back.

34:52.903 --> 34:58.453
He's not going nowhere without me.

35:00.015 --> 35:06.827
I think the life is like you want it, you know. 
harder or easier you want to make. If you want to

35:09.705 --> 35:13.549
make life harder, there's a way you can make it 
harder. Yeah. And when they make it easier,

35:14.210 --> 35:18.274
there's a way you can make your life easier. 
Because I tell my kids, I say, well, do unto others

35:18.294 --> 35:24.240
as you like them to do unto you. If you like to do 
things, just do something to somebody. They sure

35:29.165 --> 35:31.308
will do it back to you. It generally works that way. 
Yeah. Mm-hmm.

35:44.050 --> 35:44.780
You need to get...
