WEBVTT

00:01.735 --> 00:05.280
You were saying that this chart was reasonably 
accurate. I think all those charts are as good as

00:05.300 --> 00:09.186
you can put them together. Okay, so those could go 
in the front of the interviews then, and that would

00:09.206 --> 00:16.417
explain about where we feel like everyone may 
happen to be. Now then, the next thing is that you

00:16.438 --> 00:20.103
were going to say something about a British team 
also being involved. Yes, the British had, and

00:20.664 --> 00:29.818
particularly the people from Imperial Chemical 
Industry and the oil industry of Great Britain,

00:20.664 --> 00:29.818
they had teams over there too. Now, these were 
headed, if I remember, by Gordon. Kenneth Gordon,

00:33.256 --> 00:36.119
who was a very good personal friend of mine. He 
loved sailing, and I was doing a lot of sailing

00:36.179 --> 00:40.684
about that time. And Kenneth Gordon and I became 
very good close friends, as a matter of fact. And

00:44.748 --> 00:52.077
Kenneth Gordon was the man who first allowed us to 
go through Imperial Comfort Industries' coal

00:44.748 --> 00:52.077
hydrogenation plant when Storch and I went over 
there. I see. And there was another man by the name

00:53.338 --> 00:55.801
of Halroyd. I've forgotten Halroyd's first name. 
H.H. Storch. Anyway, Howell Road was a very

01:03.584 --> 01:09.052
important contributor to the knowledge in the 
British team. The British teams did not have as

01:09.072 --> 01:16.203
many people over there as we did, but I bet they had 
half as many. They were very, very knowledgeable

01:17.104 --> 01:21.551
people, too. Mr. Gordon put out the Gordon Report. 
which the British government then published

01:27.410 --> 01:30.855
about perhaps the size of it. I think I have a copy of 
that here. That's a very high item. That took us

01:34.099 --> 01:35.722
months to locate. Did it? Oh, these things are very 
difficult. I think I have a copy of Kenneth's

01:38.446 --> 01:40.328
report. I have some of the copies of the old chaos 
reports and so on, so the ones I'm particularly

01:40.969 --> 01:45.476
interested in. Of course, of course. I couldn't 
keep them all. I had a whole wall covered with these

01:48.520 --> 01:57.012
things, but as the years went by, I had to discard 
some of them, and I did. Now, two or three other

01:58.426 --> 02:03.936
things came along of importance with this. As we 
investigated both the fissure tropes and the coal

02:06.380 --> 02:21.868
hydrogenation processes and became acquainted 
with the German people who were the top echelon in

02:06.380 --> 02:21.868
the development of the processes and the 
operation of the plants and so on and so forth,

02:22.810 --> 02:32.799
particularly

02:22.810 --> 02:32.799
the group in the Bureau of Mines became very much 
interested in bringing German scientists back to

02:22.810 --> 02:32.799
this country. And the oil companies were 
interested too. And so the Army at that time was

02:37.184 --> 02:46.392
developing a means whereby we could contract with 
those people to bring them over to this country. So

02:47.373 --> 02:49.375
we brought over Donath, who was one of the best 
chemists in the coal hydrogenation work. And he

02:54.593 --> 02:57.916
was Pierre's assistant. And we brought over 
Alberts, who was Alberts and Pickler, who were

02:57.936 --> 03:14.533
very, Alberts had done most of the work in 
developing the plants, the Fischer-Tropsch

02:57.936 --> 03:14.533
plants in Germany. Pickler had done a lot of the 
research work in Germany. We brought over

03:18.194 --> 03:24.781
Hoobman, who was one of their best gasification 
people. And I guess we brought over four or five

03:25.802 --> 03:31.587
other people, and some of them whose names have 
sort of escaped my memory. We're talking about

03:31.647 --> 03:36.292
something that happened 20 or 25 years ago, so 
they've sort of escaped my mind. I can't even

03:36.312 --> 03:39.555
recall what I had for breakfast this morning. Yes. 
But anyway, and one of the things that you might be

03:41.097 --> 03:47.323
interested in is that The German technology for 
the production of oxygen in large quantities for

03:48.164 --> 03:58.478
these plants was... Hydrogen. Oxygen. For 
gasification and things like that was

03:59.620 --> 04:05.227
considerably advanced over our own technology. 
And after I got back and we began to develop

04:06.369 --> 04:16.062
Louisiana, Missouri, we wanted an oxygen plant 
to... run our copper-stoxic gasifier. Now, this

04:20.304 --> 04:24.108
is a way of making hydrogen, but you use oxygen 
along the way. And we had, in our work over there,

04:25.590 --> 04:38.545
had come on, had investigated a small oxygen 
plant, about a ton an hour plant. It was at Hakes,

04:38.565 --> 04:43.551
H-O-E-C-H-S-T, I think, outside of Frankfurt. 
And we got the idea that maybe the best way for us to

04:44.813 --> 04:54.222
get a small oxygen plant over here would be to go 
over and see if the Germans would pack that up and

04:44.813 --> 04:54.222
ship it to us. And Joe Daugherty, who was then my 
assistant in synthetic fuels, went over there,

04:55.283 --> 05:01.168
and he talked to Clay about it. And Clay said, well, 
he thought they could get it arranged. Remember,

05:03.530 --> 05:10.397
General Clay was in charge of the occupation for 
some time after Lucius Clay. I was trying to

05:10.697 --> 05:11.958
remember his first name. You've got it, Lucius 
Clay. And the Germans agreed with that. They were

05:17.440 --> 05:28.211
not using the plant, and they packed it up very 
beautifully and numbered all the parts and gave us

05:17.440 --> 05:28.211
the drawings and so on and so forth. And while Joe 
Doherty was over there getting this all arranged,

05:28.231 --> 05:36.559
I got the idea, well, maybe we ought to bring back a 
few Germans to help us put the plant together. So we

05:36.699 --> 05:44.166
got two of the workmen who were skilled in building 
these plants and two of the engineers, and we

05:36.699 --> 05:44.166
brought them over here. And we erected the plant in 
Louisiana, Missouri. And it worked beautifully.

05:47.822 --> 05:55.134
It was always a joy to me that we, the plant was not in 
use, and it was something that we could use very

05:47.822 --> 05:55.134
much. And we did run it for months at Louisiana, 
Missouri. And in a way, I think that started a much

05:58.740 --> 06:09.538
larger expansion of the volume oxygen production 
here in the United States. The Germans were way

06:09.558 --> 06:11.301
ahead of us on that. on that fitness. Now, the 
Louisiana, Missouri plant was taken over by

06:13.431 --> 06:20.658
Bechtel, or didn't Bechtel have a hand in... No, 
Bechtel built the Louisiana, Missouri plant, of

06:13.431 --> 06:20.658
course. I see, I see. Now, let me get at what 
happened in the Jura mines after this

06:21.319 --> 06:27.105
investigation. See, this was all going on just as 
we were beginning to start our investigation on a

06:27.125 --> 06:37.575
bigger scale on synthetic fuels as a result of the 
act of Congress, the Synthetic Liquid Fuel Act.

06:38.517 --> 06:49.547
And so we were very anxious, of course, to bring 
back as much information about how to build a

06:38.517 --> 06:49.547
fair-sized coal hydrogenation and fisheries 
plant as we possibly could. So these reports had

06:49.648 --> 07:00.398
specific and direct and immediate application as 
soon as we got back to the United States, as far as

06:49.648 --> 07:00.398
our own work at Louisiana, Missouri was 
concerned. So what we set out to do at Louisiana,

07:01.519 --> 07:06.904
Missouri, was to design a coal hydrogenation 
plant fairly much after the German technology, to

07:07.154 --> 07:16.445
produce about 200 barrels a day and to test 
American coals in this coal-hygienation plant.

07:16.465 --> 07:24.054
And we hired the Bechtel Corporation as the 
engineering corporation who would help assist us

07:16.465 --> 07:24.054
in designing and building this plant. Now, this is 
where Bechtel came into the picture. And as I told

07:27.418 --> 07:35.507
you, we had brought back

07:27.418 --> 07:35.507
several of the German engineers. including 
Donath. And they worked at Louisiana, Missouri

07:38.588 --> 07:44.715
with Bechtel and with our engineers to design this 
plant. And we ran that plant then through the late

07:45.436 --> 08:00.595
40s and through the early 50s, testing about five 
or six American coals in it and getting the

07:45.436 --> 08:00.595
operation of the plant smoothed out and so on and so 
forth. And as a matter of fact,

08:06.318 --> 08:29.341
I think one of the first uses for synthetic fuels is 
that on our inauguration program for that plant,

08:06.318 --> 08:29.341
I'm not sure it was the inauguration program or 
whether it was somewhat later, we ran a diesel

08:06.318 --> 08:29.341
engine train from St. Louis to Louisiana, 
Missouri with a lot of oil people on synthetic fuel

08:06.318 --> 08:29.341
that was pulled out there by synthetic fuels.

08:32.464 --> 08:35.127
That plant ran until about 1953. We also build a 
fissure tropics plant out there. Now, the fissure

08:39.591 --> 08:45.978
tropics, I don't know whether you're familiar 
with thinking about this process or not, but the

08:39.591 --> 08:45.978
fissure tropics is a two-step process. You make CO 
and hydrogen from coal with steam, coal, and

08:46.038 --> 08:50.022
oxygen. And then the CO and hydrogen are combined 
to make liquid fuels.

08:57.470 --> 09:04.978
You probably will get yourself saturated in this 
technology, even though you're a historian

08:57.470 --> 09:04.978
before you're through with this thing. And we 
build about 50 barrel a day of fissure tropics

09:05.296 --> 09:10.062
plants out there. Now, this has to be done under 
very high pressure at very high temperatures.

09:12.846 --> 09:20.956
Well, the coal hydrogenation plant is a very high 
pressure plant running anywhere from, I'd say,

09:12.846 --> 09:20.956
about 3,000 to 10,000 pounds per square inch. The 
fissure tropics is not a high pressure plant. Your

09:23.760 --> 09:27.144
highest pressures are around 500 pounds per 
square inch. But very high temperature as well.

09:30.148 --> 09:33.733
Not neither is it what we call extremely high 
temperature. The fasciotropes plant would run

09:33.983 --> 09:43.873
around, oh, I'd say around 600, 700 degrees 
Fahrenheit, and the co-hygienation plants

09:33.983 --> 09:43.873
around 900 degrees Fahrenheit. Now, those are not 
real high temperatures. Those are temperatures

09:45.394 --> 09:48.577
that go a day. As far as catalysts, did you require a 
cobalt or a nickel-thiesel or a thorium? The

09:56.465 --> 09:59.488
catalyst picture is very complex. You can... 
cobalt, molybdenum, tungsten, thorium, things

10:02.063 --> 10:10.432
like that, are excellent catalysts for coal 
hydrogenation. Strike that thorium out, that's a

10:12.374 --> 10:14.996
catalyst. But iron is a catalyst for coal 
hydrogenation. So there's a lot of catalysts. And

10:22.724 --> 10:31.193
the coal hydrogenation process, you really also 
have a two-step process in that you hydrogenate

10:22.724 --> 10:31.193
the coal in one step. And this produces some 
distillable oils that are comparable to a

10:36.015 --> 10:44.928
synthetic crude, but it also produces some heavy 
oils. And you recycle the heavy oils back through

10:44.948 --> 10:47.511
the process. Now, in Germany, in general, all of 
this distillable oil was rehydrogenated again to

10:48.273 --> 10:55.543
make final products. In the Fischer-Tropsch 
process, after you have made the gases C on

10:56.722 --> 11:12.128
hydrogen and then made your gasoline, your final 
step is usually simply a refining or distillation

10:56.722 --> 11:12.128
step to separate it out into the various products 
that you want. Now, the Fischer-Tropsch process

11:12.829 --> 11:21.143
will make anything from a very light 
gasoline-like product to a fairly heavy oil. The

11:21.730 --> 11:32.502
coal hydrogenation will also make light products 
to heavy products, but it also makes a good

11:21.730 --> 11:32.502
high-octane gasoline. The aromatic content, 
which comes from the coal itself, the coal

11:32.602 --> 11:44.375
structure, tends to make a better product for 
gasoline than the Fischer-Tropsch product does.

11:44.395 --> 11:49.240
The Fischer-Tropsch product is better for such 
oils as diesel oils and things of that nature.

11:51.835 --> 12:02.593
Now, we came back to Louisiana, Missouri with all 
of this data and built the plants and ultimately

11:51.835 --> 12:02.593
ran the plants for a number of years.

12:07.542 --> 12:16.898
By this time, we were getting into the early 1950s.

12:17.975 --> 12:31.692
We hired, oh, by the way, I should mention to you 
that on the fish tropes plant at Louisiana,

12:17.975 --> 12:31.692
Missouri, the design and construction of that 
plant was by Coppers and Company of this country.

12:31.713 --> 12:32.554
Of this country? Yeah, this country. We brought 
Totsik over here to help us design and build and

12:35.017 --> 12:39.723
erect the Totsik gas fire. Now, he was from Coppers 
of Germany. Okay. I didn't know that we had an

12:43.888 --> 12:47.813
American...

12:47.995 --> 12:51.418
Well, coppers of this kind, you must not say that. 
So they're a big company. As a historian, I

12:53.481 --> 12:55.723
wouldn't. Yes, coppers of this kind. And both 
Bechtel and coppers did a wonderful job for us.

13:05.573 --> 13:09.557
They were tremendously interested in the whole 
project, and they did a wonderful job for us. Now,

13:09.657 --> 13:12.500
let me go on with this a little bit more. Because 
we're going to come to the meat of this thing right

13:14.882 --> 13:17.665
now. At the end of the

13:18.117 --> 13:30.142
late 40s and early 50s, we had quite a lot of data and 
knew quite a lot about these operations. And so the

13:31.746 --> 13:35.233
next thing was, let's find out what the economics 
is. I mean, after all, it does come down to $1. and

13:39.127 --> 13:40.589
sense propositions. And this is the problem that 
always faces synthetic fuels or synthetic gas. As

13:46.435 --> 13:50.619
you know, you don't want to pay $4 a thousand for the 
gas going into your house. I mean, your heating

13:50.639 --> 14:02.232
bill goes from $40 a month to $200 a month, and 
you're unhappy as hell, if I may use that

13:50.639 --> 14:02.232
expression on your record. And the same thing is 
true of liquid fuels. I mean, if you have to have a

14:05.256 --> 14:19.974
plant which is enormously capital costly and 
which takes a lot of men to run and everything,

14:05.256 --> 14:19.974
you're going to have a very expensive product. So 
we hired Bechtel, and working with our own

14:19.994 --> 14:26.802
engineers, we sat down and made a study of what we 
could conceive in 1950 to be the best and the most

14:27.322 --> 14:40.518
economical coal hydrogenation plant we could 
build.

14:40.538 --> 14:55.776
And whereas at that time a refinery ran around 
$1,000 to $2,000 per barrel per day of production,

14:40.538 --> 14:55.776
these plants turned out to be about $12,000 or 
$13,000 per barrel per day of production. And the

14:57.815 --> 15:10.894
cost of the product at the refinery, gasoline at 
the refinery, was then selling for about 10 or 11

14:57.815 --> 15:10.894
cents a gallon, and the cost of gasoline from a coal 
hydrogenation plant was in the order of 30 or 35

14:57.815 --> 15:10.894
cents a gallon.

15:13.237 --> 15:14.959
So... That's the bottom line. That's the bottom 
line, and so you had to say to yourself, but this

15:15.500 --> 15:22.010
didn't look like a very economic process. And this 
was the best we could conceive. We had, in fact,

15:27.278 --> 15:29.901
increased the thermal efficiency of the process. 
The German thermal efficiency was very, very low.

15:34.765 --> 15:35.586
It was around 30%. And we had increased the thermal 
efficiency to an estimated 55% based on the heat

15:36.347 --> 15:43.414
and the coal. And this probably was the best we 
could conceive.

15:56.253 --> 16:03.480
We worked with the Copper's Company in developing 
a similar set of figures for fish troughs.

16:06.323 --> 16:16.132
And then later on, the National Petroleum Council 
wanted to enter into those studies, and we ran

16:06.323 --> 16:16.132
cooperative studies. And all of these studies 
came up with a no-go proposition as far as

16:24.873 --> 16:34.906
Competitive prices were at that time.

16:35.066 --> 16:41.154
My next question was going to be, or my original 
question was going to be, why did the program come

16:35.066 --> 16:41.154
to an end? Let me go on. That is one reason why it came 
to an end. Economics. But there's another reason.

16:51.908 --> 16:52.028
And The other reason has nothing to do with 
synthetic fuel technology. And I think you know

16:58.163 --> 17:00.066
what the other reason is. During the period of the 
30s and 40s, and particularly after World War II,

17:02.309 --> 17:21.120
there was a greatly increased exploratory effort 
in the Middle East.

17:23.817 --> 17:32.185
Although everybody knew there was a lot of oil in 
the Middle East, I don't think anybody

17:23.817 --> 17:32.185
appreciated how much oil and how cheaply oil could 
be produced in the Middle East.

17:37.510 --> 17:52.103
And Kuwait and Saudi Arabia and Iran

17:37.510 --> 17:52.103
and the surrounding countries, many of them, were 
found to be literally afloat on oil.

17:58.462 --> 18:07.133
And reserves were built up by the 60s in the order of 
hundreds of billions of barrels.

18:10.277 --> 18:19.869
And oil costs in those countries were well below a 
dollar a barrel.

18:19.889 --> 18:23.473
And shipping costs to this country were less than a 
dollar a barrel. So in any event, you were talking

18:23.943 --> 18:37.864
about oil in this country that was only worth $2 a 
barrel if it was competing with foreign oil, and

18:23.943 --> 18:37.864
maybe $3 a barrel if it was competing with American 
oil. Would you shut off the recording? Shut off,

18:39.206 --> 18:40.608
right there. Okay, okay. Well, I think that, in 
essence, brings us through. In an hour and a half,

18:46.677 --> 18:49.782
we've brought you through pretty well a... Oh, but 
I have some questions.

18:55.481 --> 18:58.165
The plants, then, I take it, were disassembled.

19:01.930 --> 19:09.762
The Louisiana, Missouri plant

19:01.930 --> 19:09.762
ran, I think, through about 1953 or 1954.

19:13.347 --> 19:17.153
And then I believe that Hercules Powder Company 
bought the site back from the government or

19:18.398 --> 19:22.804
acquired the site from the government. I believe 
that plant was disassembled, both the fissure

19:22.824 --> 19:26.750
trope and the coal hydrogenation. That's what I 
thought. Now, I wonder what happened to the

19:27.932 --> 19:29.954
records of those plants. Shouldn't they be filed 
someplace?

19:34.621 --> 19:48.000
I heard about

19:34.621 --> 19:48.000
eight months ago a group of engineers from the 
floor company were here

19:48.571 --> 20:02.733
investigating not the history but the technology 
of coal hydrogenation and fisheries operations.

20:02.753 --> 20:15.473
And they told me that those records from those 
plants had all been filed at Brewston and then

20:02.753 --> 20:15.473
ultimately had been shipped to Morgantown, West 
Virginia. but that they had gone to Morgantown,

20:16.313 --> 20:25.062
West Virginia, and somebody down there 
discovering all these files had not been in use for

20:16.313 --> 20:25.062
years and years and years had destroyed the files. 
That was shortly before they got there. So I don't

20:28.867 --> 20:30.368
know. I don't know whether this is true or not, but 
at least the Floor Corporation thought it was

20:30.468 --> 20:34.933
true. What corporation was this, then? The Floor 
Corporation. They're in Los Angeles,

20:38.297 --> 20:42.481
California. Okay, that's F-L-O-O-R? F-L-U-O-R. 
F-L-U-O-R. Yeah, they're well-known. That's a

20:49.129 --> 20:51.254
big engineering company. They're building a fish 
trough plant over for South Africa. Okay, right.

20:54.482 --> 20:57.049
That's what I thought. I wanted to make sure I got 
that. Now, isn't Kubi at Morgantown? Wayne Kuby,

21:03.209 --> 21:06.235
also in Chemical Engineering. He certainly may 
be, but the people I know, they're practically all

21:06.255 --> 21:10.262
retired. Jim McGee and Sid Cattell and those 
people are all retired. They're getting to my age,

21:15.152 --> 21:21.403
and they're lazier than I am, I think.

21:22.485 --> 21:24.088
Now, were there any studies, reprints? No. Did you 
publish any studies from the plant's activities?

21:27.624 --> 21:29.447
Oh, there's an enormous amount of publications. 
Okay. Those, you see those books there. You should

21:31.491 --> 21:32.593
have. Right. That's not one. Is this the annual 
report? Those are the annual reports. That's what

21:36.641 --> 21:38.404
comes out of those plants right there. And I think 
they ran through 54 maybe or 55. So those are all

21:43.514 --> 21:46.900
available. Okay. And then there were a lot of 
journal articles published, and there were

21:48.721 --> 21:56.328
separate—you ought to get—the Bureau of Mines has 
a library in there. Whatever publication they've

21:57.009 --> 22:01.293
ever put out, it was in the Department of Interior. 
And if you can't find it in the Department of

22:01.413 --> 22:07.659
Interior, I think they have a very complete 
library still out here on the campus at their

22:01.413 --> 22:07.659
college. You know, there's the Bureau of Mines 
station out there. Here? I didn't know that. Yeah,

22:11.363 --> 22:17.108
it's just up the hill from us, about half a mile, a 
quarter of a mile. And they have a complete

22:17.662 --> 22:19.104
library. But if you go down to the Department of 
Interior, they have a complete, even a more

22:19.565 --> 22:23.511
complete library. No short pictures of the plant 
and everything else, no. Because we haven't, I

22:26.736 --> 22:30.181
haven't seen any of these, no references to these. 
You've never seen them? No, never. No, all that

22:33.146 --> 22:34.949
work was well documented.

22:37.433 --> 22:44.243
Okay, now it, now the Germans who came over and 
assembled the plants, did they stay here or did

22:37.433 --> 22:44.243
they return to Germany? A fair share of them stayed 
here. Donath was with us at Louisiana, Missouri,

22:48.853 --> 22:57.724
up through the days of the operation of the plant. 
He left Louisiana, Missouri, and went with the

22:57.744 --> 23:00.628
coppers company. He had two sons of both, I 
believe, who graduated from MIT and did very well

23:01.549 --> 23:07.277
in their schoolwork. Donath then retired and went 
out to the Virgin Islands, St. Thomas, I believe.

23:13.072 --> 23:16.538
And he may still be living, but I'm not absolutely 
sure of that. Alberts, I believe, also joined

23:18.621 --> 23:25.032
Blaunox, which later became Gravo Company. And I 
believe Alberts is here, if he's still living. I

23:29.499 --> 23:31.122
can't tell you all these things. And, uh, Hoobman, 
uh, Hoobman, I believe, uh, went back to Germany.

23:36.242 --> 23:40.807
He headed the Lurgy organization, uh, back in 
Germany after he went back. I believe he's dead

23:41.888 --> 23:42.869
now. I'm not sure of this. Uh, I have a little 
problem. I don't know what happened to Pickler. I

23:49.036 --> 23:51.719
really don't know any, uh, what happened to 
Pickler. I have a slight historical problem with

23:51.739 --> 23:55.303
the bring you over to the German war scientists. It 
seems to me that, at least in disciplines other

23:55.722 --> 24:05.652
than oil, in your field, in chemistry, Americans 
were making plans to bring the German scientists

23:55.722 --> 24:05.652
back as early as 1944. Is that not correct? No, I'm 
sure they weren't. Because I think Operation

24:09.036 --> 24:12.720
Paperclip, as it was called... Yeah, that's 
what's right. Okay. I think those guys were

24:13.581 --> 24:18.806
talking about which scientists they wanted and 
which scientists they didn't want by the middle of

24:13.581 --> 24:18.806
1944. Well, it may have been earlier than that. I 
don't know. Okay. We brought them back... I would

24:26.401 --> 24:29.805
say that most of them were on their way here in 545. 
I'm

24:30.146 --> 24:38.496
far from sure that we were the earliest team over 
there, too. I'm sure that some of the explosive

24:38.557 --> 24:44.244
teams and people like that were over there earlier 
than we were. Quite frankly, that's what I thought

24:44.264 --> 24:46.266
you were doing over there. When I saw explosives, I 
thought you were there with heavy water. It would

24:48.910 --> 24:50.091
make sense. No, no, we had nothing to do with that. 
Okay, the...

24:56.118 --> 25:04.353
Was there any informal or formal contact among the 
members of TOM and the German scientists after the

24:56.118 --> 25:04.353
plants were disassembled? I mean, just what I'm 
trying to find out, and the question is poorly

25:04.974 --> 25:12.328
phrased, does the issue of synthetic oil just 
simply drop off the board, so to speak? No, when we

25:12.669 --> 25:16.135
came back, we had...

25:18.562 --> 25:32.267
Oh, I would say three or four or five meetings of not 
necessarily, certainly not all of the team, but

25:18.562 --> 25:32.267
various sections of the team came to meetings in 
Washington and so on and so forth. And these were

25:32.287 --> 25:41.785
meetings that Miller was very active in, and 
getting the reports organized and getting a

25:32.287 --> 25:41.785
spotlight.

25:44.887 --> 25:56.409
But I'd say within a year after we got back, the 
thing was pretty well, in a sense. Was it because

25:57.491 --> 26:04.785
President Truman had done away with the Petroleum 
Administration for War? the war administration

26:05.980 --> 26:15.551
for petroleum, or was it the fact perhaps that 
people were no longer interested in secrets and

26:05.980 --> 26:15.551
documents and... I think the latter. I see. I 
think... But this is a wartime activity. I think

26:20.076 --> 26:31.108
industry

26:20.076 --> 26:31.108
had now had available most of the information they 
wanted about the German technology. Good. And...

26:35.782 --> 26:37.203
That's better, isn't it? Yes, I think maybe it'll 
pick it up slightly better. I mean, it'll take a hum

26:39.085 --> 26:40.066
out of it. And as far as we in the Bureau of Mines are 
concerned, we had gathered most information we

26:40.906 --> 26:55.799
wanted about their synthetic fuel work and about 
their fissure trucks work and had used it in our

26:40.906 --> 26:55.799
plants and our laboratories. And so I think it just 
naturally tapered off rather. Plus the fact that

27:01.084 --> 27:04.827
it wasn't proven to be economical at the moment. It 
wasn't proving to be economical, we see what we

27:05.127 --> 27:09.173
see. And now, may I go on just to... Sure, we will. 
The only reason we're questioning is some things

27:16.064 --> 27:19.910
we won't put in right here in the story. This...

27:21.011 --> 27:31.928
After the price of oil began to rise, I would say in 
the middle and late 60s,

27:32.920 --> 27:53.848
we sensed again that it was probable that the world 
as a whole was going to be interested in converting

27:32.920 --> 27:53.848
coal to fuels.

27:57.954 --> 28:01.999
And I think everybody thought that by the time oil 
reached $8 to $9 a barrel, that then synthetic fuel

28:02.519 --> 28:12.508
plants would become an economic possibility. 
Now, by we, do you mean the Bureau of Mines again?

28:17.393 --> 28:19.255
Well, I think not only the Bureau of Mines. I left 
the Bureau of Mines in 1953. That's what I thought.

28:23.679 --> 28:27.182
And so this was not only the Bureau of Mines. I think 
the Bureau of Mines had the same feeling But I

28:29.857 --> 28:31.539
talked to oil people. At that time, I was a member of 
a number of committees of the National Academy of

28:31.599 --> 28:36.444
Science. And we had began to review these 
processes. And I think both the oil people and the

28:39.967 --> 28:48.896
Bureau of Mines and people like myself began to 
feel, well, synthetic fuels was coming back into

28:39.967 --> 28:48.896
the picture. But two things happened, which were I 
guess it's fair to say, quite discouraging.

29:03.273 --> 29:25.834
One

29:03.273 --> 29:25.834
was that

29:03.273 --> 29:25.834
while IRDA had spent a lot of money on 
investigating the technology,

29:03.273 --> 29:25.834
and this had been over a period of four or five 
years, We didn't have any material breakthrough

29:28.160 --> 29:34.887
in the technology.

29:37.549 --> 29:46.999
We were still following the German patterns in 
both the coal hydrogenation work and the

29:37.549 --> 29:46.999
Fischer-Trumpsch work. And without a material 
breakthrough, we still faced a highly complex and

29:48.741 --> 29:57.289
costly plan.

29:59.716 --> 30:06.101
And the next thing that began to happen is that 
there were enormous inflation of construction

29:59.716 --> 30:06.101
costs. And then the third thing that began to 
happen is there was an enormous inflation in coal

30:08.544 --> 30:13.688
costs. So when you ultimately got through, you 
faced the fact that even though we knew better

30:15.530 --> 30:28.761
catalysts, and even though we knew that we could 
operate at lower pressures, and even though we had

30:29.112 --> 30:49.636
cut the retention times to a minor extent, we still 
faced oil that was probably, at the minimum, $20 a

30:29.112 --> 30:49.636
barrel, and probably might easily go to $30 a 
barrel. And this was in face of the fact that we are

30:51.518 --> 30:58.326
now importing oil at $12 or $14 a barrel, and we were 
still behind the economic eight ball.
