WEBVTT

00:02.427 --> 00:05.210
I think that's what happened to it.

00:05.250 --> 00:16.544
I don't think it ever... If it came into being, it sort of died a natural death and no one talked about it much after that semester where they were trying to promote it.

00:16.564 --> 00:20.629
They'd have students come in and try to talk about why we should have it and that sort of thing.

00:20.649 --> 00:22.211
Everyone would listen and be very respectful.

00:22.251 --> 00:29.700
But most classrooms now, the teacher was totally in control.

00:30.322 --> 00:36.088
No one ever went to the classroom and would want to be a problem kid or be a smart mouth.

00:36.289 --> 00:37.290
That's what I was thinking about.

00:37.550 --> 00:38.191
Yeah.

00:38.591 --> 00:45.779
That whether they were called rules or not, I assume you were seldom, if ever, late.

00:48.522 --> 00:50.985
And did you go to sleep in class?

00:51.265 --> 00:51.966
Oh, yeah.

00:51.986 --> 00:53.748
But you tried not to do it just openly.

00:54.129 --> 00:54.389
Okay.

00:54.409 --> 00:58.033
But we were all so fatigued out most of the time that it was...

00:58.587 --> 01:03.914
We tried to stay awake the best we could and we tried to hide it if we got fatigued where we needed sleep.

01:03.934 --> 01:08.480
But the attitude that we had in class was that the teachers had what we wanted.

01:09.242 --> 01:21.919
Not necessarily to become smarter or to be scholarly, but they had a passing grade or grade good enough or whatever it was that students were looking for.

01:21.939 --> 01:27.987
That's where it came from and we realized that and we never wanted to antagonize a teacher in any way and

01:28.473 --> 01:34.282
It was natural for all of us at that time to think the teachers knew what was best for us, and we didn't have to pretend too much.

01:34.322 --> 01:37.526
We just felt like they were in charge and we were the students, unlike today.

01:37.887 --> 01:40.731
Did you feel that you got the grades you deserved?

01:43.535 --> 01:48.863
I got the grades I think I was satisfied with.

01:49.164 --> 01:51.147
I never tried for the next letter grade.

01:51.167 --> 01:55.493
No, but did you get the grade that you felt you earned that was appropriate for

01:55.861 --> 01:57.583
for the level of achievement.

01:57.603 --> 02:08.197
Yeah, I knew where I was at all time and if I could make two points higher on the final and make a B as opposed to a C, I wouldn't stay up all night and study for the extra two points.

02:08.737 --> 02:13.944
Whatever the grades were, I was not going to be in academics.

02:14.024 --> 02:20.232
I knew that the difference in a B and a C was just whether or not I one night stayed up late and studied for the final.

02:20.532 --> 02:23.515
In the overall scheme of things, was I smarter or dumber?

02:23.535 --> 02:25.858
So I just, what the hell, just take the grade and run.

02:26.578 --> 02:30.202
So, yeah, I think I got most of the grades I deserved.

02:30.222 --> 02:34.747
One of the hardest courses I had back in those days was that ROTC.

02:35.608 --> 02:39.452
Because they felt like they were trying to withhold it from you.

02:39.472 --> 02:43.757
And they had your ticket to co-rift.

02:43.777 --> 02:49.543
And they felt like if they can dangle that in front of you and just make it as miserable as they could, they were doing something good for mankind.

02:50.722 --> 02:53.245
But we made it through that kind of stuff, too.

02:53.265 --> 03:06.140
But really looking back, I think that's the only unfair situation that I recall is taking some Mickey Mouse set of courses like that and trying to make them so difficult.

03:06.160 --> 03:10.646
Now you stayed with the architecture major from start to finish.

03:10.666 --> 03:10.826
Right.

03:11.647 --> 03:13.429
And you finished in five years?

03:14.911 --> 03:15.131
Mm-hmm.

03:15.652 --> 03:17.053
There was no question about those days.

03:17.073 --> 03:19.056
You finished on schedule.

03:19.076 --> 03:20.037
What did you think?

03:20.438 --> 03:21.860
your career was going to be?

03:22.641 --> 03:25.204
When you were an undergraduate, what did you think you were going to spend your life doing?

03:25.885 --> 03:35.658
I thought I'd probably get a job in an architect's office and kick around in that and do well enough to make a living.

03:35.678 --> 03:47.634
Let's see, and you, I'm looking at my notes, you never were party to some outrageous prank, legendary joke?

03:47.654 --> 03:48.775
I really don't think

03:50.155 --> 03:51.116
I really think not.

03:52.118 --> 03:52.318
No.

03:52.999 --> 04:04.274
You know, to me, I like a lot of little jokes and a little bit of minor harsh play, but to try to pull off some great big scandals type event, the stakes were too high to do that.

04:04.294 --> 04:18.694
Like Fort Allbritton told me about a great one over in the new dorm area, right after it's finished, they had a sophomore that was really a bad egg, and the water faucet was outside the building right next to the room,

04:19.079 --> 04:24.845
They sandbagged his door, put a water hose through the window, and put three feet of water in the room.

04:25.305 --> 04:28.188
And it woke him up when it got up to where he was asleep.

04:28.668 --> 04:34.074
And he said they didn't realize, though, who was going to have to clean that water up when they finally moved the sandbags from the door.

04:34.634 --> 04:37.297
So he'd all let the freshmen have to clean up the whole door.

04:37.497 --> 04:41.461
They did have a bad thing that happened when you were in school down here with water.

04:42.042 --> 04:43.964
Yeah, Ross Hall, they ruined that building.

04:43.984 --> 04:45.325
But that didn't turn me on.

04:45.465 --> 04:48.428
I just thought that was childlike, and it was...

04:49.285 --> 04:56.495
Like you say, you've got a job to clean up when it's over, and it's costly, and you could be kicked out of school for that.

04:57.076 --> 05:01.823
As you look back, which were the important to your life?

05:02.383 --> 05:05.888
Which were the most important courses in the effect they had on your life?

05:11.316 --> 05:12.638
It's going to sound funny.

05:12.718 --> 05:15.782
In high school, the most important course I took was typing.

05:16.167 --> 05:22.077
since I've done so much of that kind of manuscript messing around with business since then.

05:22.097 --> 05:41.668
But in college, well there had to be architecture courses because that's what I majored in and it helped with creativity and it helped with design work and it helped with recognizing good and bad features about your environment.

05:42.627 --> 05:44.729
But that's just an apple pie answer.

05:44.749 --> 05:50.235
You're looking for something dramatic and that's all I can come up with.

05:50.255 --> 05:58.505
What changed your life was when you got the job down here and Dean Benson offered you a... He's talking about college.

05:59.706 --> 05:59.846
I know.

06:00.106 --> 06:00.547
Let's see.

06:01.188 --> 06:02.489
Back to student days.

06:04.591 --> 06:11.419
Did the MSC activities have a very important part of your student life?

06:12.023 --> 06:16.810
Did you go to many of the events connected to the MSC?

06:16.890 --> 06:17.030
No.

06:18.792 --> 06:21.677
What about religious emphasis week?

06:21.697 --> 06:21.897
No.

06:23.419 --> 06:24.721
Okay, let's go to Saturday night.

06:24.801 --> 06:28.827
You and your buddies are here in town, and you're going to have a good time on Saturday night.

06:29.528 --> 06:30.649
Only one thing to do is go to a movie.

06:31.470 --> 06:32.031
That's it.

06:32.051 --> 06:33.393
You all never went to anything more?

06:34.695 --> 06:37.018
Where could I...

06:37.910 --> 06:43.178
even though you might not have done it, where could I, if I were around then, where could I have gotten something strong to drink?

06:46.323 --> 06:52.172
Well, when I first came to A&M, I went down to Youngbloods and got by ordering a beer every now and then.

06:52.192 --> 06:54.756
Then they cracked down on it and it became more difficult.

06:54.836 --> 07:02.107
And, you know, we had the old Triangle Drive-In where the guys with cars, and, God, they were in a minority-level hassle.

07:02.127 --> 07:04.491
Guys with cars would pull up down the Triangle

07:05.264 --> 07:09.889
whatever it's called, Tom's Barbecue, somewhere in that area.

07:09.909 --> 07:12.672
Or the shack down there, what's it called?

07:12.772 --> 07:13.713
Chicken oil.

07:14.053 --> 07:19.739
And they'd pull up down there and the main reason they did is to flirt with the carhops.

07:20.199 --> 07:22.281
You know, there were just no girls around.

07:22.301 --> 07:25.585
So they'd sit down there and drink beer and stay there until midnight.

07:25.745 --> 07:28.187
But I didn't have a car.

07:28.367 --> 07:29.689
I didn't have the money to buy the beer.

07:29.709 --> 07:30.850
I went old enough to buy the beer.

07:30.948 --> 07:35.253
And what I just said describes 98% of people on campus.

07:36.194 --> 07:41.620
So essentially for true entertainment, you can go over to MSE and just sort of shuffle around.

07:42.581 --> 07:44.002
You know, what's the big deal about bowling?

07:45.304 --> 07:47.986
You say, oh, I had a good night bowling last time.

07:48.006 --> 07:48.948
No one cared about that.

07:48.968 --> 07:53.232
And you shuffle around, they had a little reading library, and they had room for 20 students to do that.

07:54.353 --> 07:55.875
So essentially you went to a movie.

07:56.463 --> 07:58.605
And to this day there's not much more to do, is there?

07:58.625 --> 08:02.429
Could you go to Guyon Hall then and see a movie?

08:02.710 --> 08:02.910
Yeah.

08:02.930 --> 08:06.754
That was probably the brightest spot of all when you could see a movie at Guyon Hall.

08:07.114 --> 08:10.938
And I don't think they had them on every night, but on weekends they did.

08:11.659 --> 08:18.807
And that was fun because you could raise cane and, you know, talk to the screen and yell roommate and all that kind of stuff.

08:18.827 --> 08:24.613
So, you know, that sense of humor gave you sort of like an animal house where you could go there and just raise cane.

08:25.133 --> 08:26.595
Was the campus theater going then?

08:26.836 --> 08:27.136
Yeah.

08:27.577 --> 08:31.863
But it was more exotic to go downtown to the palace?

08:31.883 --> 08:38.814
Yeah, well, you know, how it is with films that have one here that you maybe already have seen or don't care about seeing, and the one down there is better.

08:38.834 --> 08:47.867
So we didn't go down to Bryan just every week or every day, but when we did have an outing and said, we're going to have an outing, that's what you do is probably go to one of the movie houses.

08:47.887 --> 08:51.613
Where did you catch your, if you're hitchhiking to go downtown Bryan, where did you hitchhike?

08:52.285 --> 08:53.366
Where'd you stand?

08:53.547 --> 09:14.112
They had common stands where you would hitchhike from and I think everything leaving College Station, I believe everything, was up at the old post office right across the street in what used to be A&M camera shop right across from where the Lupo's is now diving across on the corner standing right there and sometimes there'd be 30, 40 guys standing there to catch a ride.

09:14.853 --> 09:18.377
And it was easy to catch a ride and somebody stopped, three or four of you could get in and you go down

09:18.813 --> 09:26.802
And then on the way back you'd walk up to the corner where the old train station was in Bryan, which is that main street going through the main part of Bryan.

09:28.504 --> 09:31.467
It's College Avenue I guess comes all the way and goes through Bryan.

09:31.487 --> 09:38.214
So corner of across the street there where the old train station was and you catch a ride back and that wasn't hard to do.

09:38.234 --> 09:39.936
Sometimes you have to wait 10 minutes or so.

09:40.277 --> 09:48.786
Now and I understood that if we were out on the highway somewhere that there was an, that class rank didn't matter

09:49.137 --> 09:52.361
at hitchhiking, it was when you got there, you got in line.

09:52.901 --> 09:56.045
And that was done the same way in your era on these short runs.

09:56.925 --> 10:05.295
And back to beer, was there a careful check on the minimum age of somebody buying beer at the Triangle?

10:05.315 --> 10:09.159
Well, there were periods when it was casual.

10:10.020 --> 10:13.824
Then they cracked down, it seems like that time I got here.

10:13.844 --> 10:16.647
They cracked down on that and it got more difficult.

10:16.998 --> 10:19.581
What if we wanted stronger than beer?

10:19.601 --> 10:21.864
I don't know where to go.

10:22.524 --> 10:24.307
Whiskey Bridge wasn't available?

10:24.327 --> 10:26.369
It was there, but that was out of my league.

10:26.389 --> 10:27.650
What did I want strong drink for?

10:27.690 --> 10:29.493
I had my schedule totally full.

10:30.253 --> 10:31.315
And I didn't want it in a dorm.

10:31.335 --> 10:32.036
I didn't have a car.

10:32.076 --> 10:32.556
What did you do?

10:32.796 --> 10:34.378
Walk out there and walk back with it.

10:35.079 --> 10:37.061
I was scared to death I'd get kicked out of school.

10:37.081 --> 10:46.212
One time when we were coming back, my roommate and I were coming back from somewhere at night, up around Kern somewhere, and somebody had hit a cow or a deer on the road.

10:46.715 --> 10:51.600
And they had a bottle in their car, and I think they gave it to us.

10:52.380 --> 10:53.702
Or somehow we ended up with the bottle.

10:53.742 --> 10:56.865
I think they were afraid to cop the time we found them with the bottle.

10:56.885 --> 10:58.506
And we brought it home, and you know, I was scared to death.

10:58.526 --> 11:01.329
We had that in the bottom dresser drawer and underwear and stuff way back in there.

11:01.389 --> 11:02.790
And I said, man, they're going to know about this.

11:03.251 --> 11:04.872
I just felt like those guys would find it.

11:04.993 --> 11:09.217
And they'd call me in and run me out, and everything I'd done in college would be zeroed out.

11:11.058 --> 11:14.882
We were a believer in rules in those days, and I was scared to death about getting caught.

11:15.149 --> 11:18.954
How often did somebody wander into Hart Hall?

11:18.974 --> 11:29.367
Again, with athletes, how often did somebody wander in that lived there that was drunk?

11:29.387 --> 11:35.995
Oh, it'd be hard for me to say with the ramp system we had, because they could come in in a ramp next to us, and we'd never know about it.

11:36.035 --> 11:41.882
But I would say that in my time of being there, I only saw it happen maybe a dozen times.

11:42.554 --> 11:43.895
you're saying in four or five years.

11:44.536 --> 11:46.658
So it was very unusual.

11:48.460 --> 11:58.391
And by and large, there was no professional employee living there to check.

11:59.132 --> 12:02.655
It was all self-controlled.

12:03.757 --> 12:06.179
Nobody was there to catch you if you came in drunk.

12:06.339 --> 12:11.565
For a while, they had an office down on the first floor that looked at

12:12.338 --> 12:21.412
sort of across the street, looked out at that administration building over there, and I think an old boy used to play on the 39 football team, had an office there.

12:22.454 --> 12:30.346
I don't know, I can't remember his name, but he was our tack officer, they called him, but he didn't spend a night there.

12:31.148 --> 12:40.202
And we had our upperclassmen, and that was the structure of the quarter where the CEO of the outfit and the first sergeants, and those people were supposed to keep everything.

12:40.807 --> 12:43.510
together and we didn't have anything called for.

12:47.213 --> 12:51.878
Some celebrities that came to the campus to perform or speak that you remember?

12:52.639 --> 12:54.561
Musicians, singers, speakers?

12:55.542 --> 13:00.147
Charles Vaughton came over and gave some readings once.

13:00.167 --> 13:06.833
We had a guy named Teller, one of the comic bomb fellas, he came down once.

13:07.154 --> 13:08.995
Did you see or hear either of those?

13:09.076 --> 13:09.396
Yeah.

13:09.616 --> 13:10.577
What was your impression?

13:11.131 --> 13:14.456
Well, I didn't know what Teller was talking about.

13:15.838 --> 13:25.874
Charles Lawton gave some readings from the Bible and did a much better job than anybody else could have done probably.

13:25.894 --> 13:29.721
But when it was all over he said, I think I might have been in bed and been better.

13:31.664 --> 13:33.126
Had a better use of my time there.

13:34.067 --> 13:35.670
And we had a few

13:36.089 --> 13:39.693
singers, Johnny James, people like that there, our sweethearts.

13:39.713 --> 13:43.337
I don't think Patti Page ever came, but she was real big in those times in those days.

13:44.238 --> 13:45.960
And Johnny James was too.

13:47.682 --> 13:49.844
Did any big orchestras come?

13:50.985 --> 13:51.305
Yeah.

13:52.427 --> 13:53.748
Now a lot of those things I didn't go to.

13:53.788 --> 14:02.558
They were across the street where I could hit it with a rock from my dorm room at Gine Hall, and there I was at the Hart Hall.

14:02.578 --> 14:03.919
And if you had to spare time,

14:04.709 --> 14:07.773
Just having relaxation is the best use of your time of all.

14:08.594 --> 14:18.548
And I went to a number of those shows, but it's sort of like the shows of the day that's been around the track a few times that you can live without them.

14:18.568 --> 14:24.656
Yeah, they had all kind of... Yeah, we didn't have girls on.

14:24.716 --> 14:26.258
I didn't have... Let me one more time.

14:26.278 --> 14:27.219
I didn't have a car.

14:27.540 --> 14:28.561
I didn't have any money.

14:29.082 --> 14:30.143
I didn't even have a girl.

14:30.460 --> 14:37.087
And, you know, by the time you got a girl down here and walked across, this is Timber Street.

14:37.147 --> 14:45.155
I had my girlfriend down here when I was a freshman that stayed at the first block of Timber Street up here in a lady's house named Avery who lived there.

14:46.676 --> 14:48.458
And that's where Timber Street ended.

14:48.658 --> 14:49.579
All this wasn't here.

14:50.360 --> 14:51.941
So these were cowlots.

14:51.961 --> 14:59.809
So I took her bag and walked from way over in the middle of the campus to this woman's house to put her there.

15:00.143 --> 15:05.649
Then I walked back to the dorm, and the next day I came back to the dorm, and the family was all over.

15:05.709 --> 15:06.951
The weekend was going away.

15:08.132 --> 15:13.358
She had to catch a bus to go back to TSEW, and all this cost money.

15:13.378 --> 15:18.543
And it was, when it was over, I've always been sort of an analytical guy that I called, let's put the pencil to that.

15:18.704 --> 15:20.646
I said, okay, here we go.

15:20.786 --> 15:25.471
Bus down, meals done, rental for Ms.

15:25.491 --> 15:26.252
Avery's house,

15:26.519 --> 15:29.602
and a dance, and a ticket to that, and you add all this.

15:29.622 --> 15:31.243
Man, it just doesn't make sense.

15:31.264 --> 15:34.927
So I got to where I just quit doing that kind of thing because it just didn't make sense.

15:34.947 --> 15:35.708
Like senior boots.

15:35.728 --> 15:36.889
I never had senior boots on.

15:38.811 --> 15:44.216
I got to the point where I tried somebody's boots on and put them on, pants, and how much are these, and what's that?

15:44.256 --> 15:45.917
And I said, well, let's see.

15:45.958 --> 15:51.583
If I had these, I'd wear them three times here and two times there, and then I'd have to worry about selling these damn things.

15:51.623 --> 15:54.906
So by the time you, that's part of life.

15:55.105 --> 15:59.591
that where you take fun out of life is being sort of sensible.

15:59.931 --> 16:07.461
Right, now if you had not lived in Hart, if you had lived over in the court area, would anybody have teased you about not having senior boots?

16:07.601 --> 16:09.523
Was that uncommon in your era?

16:09.543 --> 16:13.088
It was uncommon they wouldn't tease you about it.

16:13.108 --> 16:16.152
So that a few others did not have boots?

16:16.172 --> 16:16.572
Yeah.

16:16.592 --> 16:18.835
Oh, okay.

16:18.855 --> 16:19.636
But it was uncommon.

16:19.656 --> 16:24.943
You know, most guys say, well, senior boots, you know, by the time you go from a freshman, that's when they look sort of good,

16:25.126 --> 16:30.054
up to one time you seen her, then you start saying, I saw a Mickey Mouse.

16:30.074 --> 16:39.349
If it's part of the uniform, I'd sure wear them, but to buy them, then they outlaid $400 or so for boots and all the gear it takes, and you'd have that problem of getting rid of them.

16:39.849 --> 16:41.212
Now you did go on court trips.

16:41.712 --> 16:43.335
Yeah.

16:43.355 --> 16:46.220
Is there anyone that stands out in your memory that you can share?

16:46.280 --> 16:49.665
Some court trip where something unusual happened?

16:50.978 --> 16:51.759
Plus or minus?

16:52.019 --> 16:56.144
No, most everything I remember about court trips is completely negative.

16:56.184 --> 16:57.665
You're back to some dollar and cent stuff.

16:58.166 --> 17:03.091
You go to the hotel and everything is overpriced and any price will be overpriced.

17:03.211 --> 17:06.835
For me, it was difficult and you had to hitchhike back and get a ride.

17:09.278 --> 17:14.403
None of that stuff had the shine to it once you looked at it closely.

17:14.423 --> 17:17.546
What did you and your buddies think about the band in those days?

17:19.088 --> 17:20.049
Did you respect them?

17:20.570 --> 17:20.850
Yeah.

17:21.185 --> 17:26.572
The band in my day was a tough outfit.

17:26.592 --> 17:32.039
They had their freshmen mixed in with the upperclassmen like in Hart Hall.

17:32.059 --> 17:37.186
And they used to do a lot of ass beating in the band.

17:37.206 --> 17:42.874
And I think they were trying to overly compensate for being band people.

17:42.894 --> 17:49.082
In high school the band has always been thought of as sort of the people who are the non-athletes.

17:49.332 --> 17:51.215
It's too bad it's that way, but it just is.

17:51.755 --> 17:54.178
And they came down here and the band said, no, we're going to draw the line.

17:54.199 --> 17:56.882
We're going to be the roughest outfit on campus.

17:57.503 --> 18:00.707
And I think the band bragged about it more than they should have.

18:00.727 --> 18:02.369
Oh, yeah, we beat ass all last night.

18:02.930 --> 18:05.313
And I'm sure they did.

18:06.114 --> 18:14.766
What campus student leadership position office had the highest prestige among other students?

18:18.560 --> 18:24.328
being CO or first sergeant of an outfit in the Corps.

18:24.348 --> 18:26.851
And that was more prestigious than being class president?

18:27.692 --> 18:28.573
Hell yeah.

18:28.593 --> 18:32.078
What about Corps commander?

18:32.098 --> 18:41.530
A little bit easy to fall in that category where someone is picked that's not necessarily the selection of the Corps, but the ROTC people picked this guy out because of

18:42.320 --> 18:44.983
column of stuff they added up of some sort.

18:45.003 --> 18:49.608
So in not all cases were these guys the pick of the Corps.

18:49.628 --> 18:51.010
And band commanders same way?

18:53.652 --> 18:58.718
None of us except people in the band would really know how they did it over there.

18:59.078 --> 19:05.746
Probably they were such a close-knit group and worked so close together and had so many drills we didn't have.

19:05.766 --> 19:12.293
Maybe they were a little bit more selected based on their surviving

19:13.471 --> 19:15.313
the structure they live within.

19:17.296 --> 19:20.700
And we had some of those problems with being first sergeant CO's too.

19:20.840 --> 19:27.368
I'm not sure how much input the student officers had as they left.

19:27.428 --> 19:30.592
I think most of us ROTC selection completely.

19:31.453 --> 19:34.717
But we always, they were in charge of your life.

19:34.737 --> 19:37.420
That's the main reason we felt that way because you know the first sergeant

19:37.872 --> 19:53.393
sets all the rules for the freshman and sophomore, and it sets the tone, and then the CO you sort of feel like is someone who's somewhat charged with accountability for you and what you do in the group your contemporaries do.

19:53.413 --> 19:57.098
Now, did you ever aspire to one of those core leadership roles?

19:57.439 --> 20:07.272
Oh, I think everybody did, but my grades in ROTC were not that good, I was trying to tell you, but

20:08.045 --> 20:10.469
I had two buttons, but that wasn't a big deal.

20:10.489 --> 20:16.157
You know, by the time you get there again, it's not as important as it is when you're a freshman looking upward at it.

20:18.321 --> 20:23.769
Now, and by the time you get here, the World War II veterans are pretty well gone.

20:25.872 --> 20:27.234
No, they're still getting in here.

20:27.335 --> 20:27.775
Were they?

20:27.795 --> 20:28.637
And where did they live?

20:29.678 --> 20:32.082
Most of them lived down Military Walk.

20:34.125 --> 20:35.487
Well, I have to take that back now.

20:36.513 --> 20:40.079
The dorm next to the YMCA, is that Milner in there?

20:40.840 --> 20:51.898
I think that room was, they had, when they brought people back from the annex, nearly all of the buildings were full of freshmen and corps.

20:52.338 --> 20:56.285
Leggett was a corps dorm, they had three to a room in it.

20:56.305 --> 20:59.269
And let's see, Milner I think is the one across from the old exchange store.

21:00.191 --> 21:03.516
And there's one along the military walk there across the street from

21:05.183 --> 21:07.788
Why would I ever get named that dorm?

21:07.808 --> 21:09.271
Was Gathright still there?

21:09.291 --> 21:14.881
No, Gathright was just a mound of brick that everybody exchanged to him.

21:14.901 --> 21:23.277
There was a dorm right along the military walk that most of the veterans lived in, and I'm sure the numbers weren't as great.

21:23.813 --> 21:34.664
But see, I started in 1950, and World War I ended in 1945, so even if everyone had good luck coming to A&M and went to school four years, there'd still be some ragtag people left over.

21:34.844 --> 21:42.131
Were there some temporary trailers or barracks down beyond the football stadium still left?

21:42.532 --> 21:42.832
Yeah.

21:42.852 --> 21:44.333
For the GI couples.

21:44.353 --> 21:46.796
Now, if you were married... That's what I mean.

21:46.836 --> 21:47.396
A married student.

21:47.416 --> 21:49.799
Now, that's easy, but I thought you were talking about unmarried.

21:49.819 --> 21:49.879
No.

21:49.919 --> 21:53.162
Yeah, the married students, they lived over here in this shack area.

21:53.682 --> 22:02.736
Barracks area behind, what is that area called by the north gate over there, University and Texas Avenue, back in that area.

22:02.836 --> 22:03.637
In the College View?

22:04.078 --> 22:05.660
Yeah, that's called College View.

22:06.281 --> 22:13.672
And then there were some barracks back over in this area here, and they had a lot of shotgun houses they just built, and they're still sort of halfway in existence.

22:13.952 --> 22:22.045
Were the project houses where the youngsters from various counties on Jersey and Wilburn Road?

22:22.065 --> 22:22.305
Yeah.

22:23.045 --> 22:25.527
They were still there too.

22:25.588 --> 22:26.609
They were still busy.

22:28.050 --> 22:36.018
And of course all the faculty had these great big old houses that lived on campus too and they started moving those out I guess while I was here or maybe right at that time I graduated.

22:36.799 --> 22:39.862
Did any of your buddies ever try to find dates locally?

22:40.222 --> 22:41.323
Oh hell yeah, beautifully.

22:43.786 --> 22:46.108
Yeah, a lot of them did.

22:46.168 --> 22:49.151
They wasted a lot of time doing that too.

22:49.171 --> 22:50.993
It was real easy to do a lot of looking.

22:51.361 --> 23:02.781
All right, if a young man had a date, either local or out of town, and he wanted to take her to some special place off campus, where would it go?

23:02.881 --> 23:13.660
Where would a special date have... I'm talking about now to eat or... They had a place, I forget the name of it, that was out here off the road.

23:13.680 --> 23:15.563
Was it Franklin's?

23:15.847 --> 23:31.783
Franklin's is out where the vet hospital is but you had to be 21 to get in out there because they serve alcoholic beverages and if you weren't 21 you know you didn't have a ticket so yeah you went to a movie that's all there is to do.

23:32.524 --> 23:38.610
You could take them out to eat I guess but you know first you got to have a car and then you have the money to take them to eat.

23:38.630 --> 23:43.155
Let's see while you were here summer jobs did you have any meaningful summer jobs?

23:43.895 --> 23:45.617
Oh yes they were meaningful.

23:46.593 --> 23:47.354
I sure did.

23:48.275 --> 24:15.013
Yeah, let's see, I went home and I did everything going from farm work to, I had a job with the government for a couple summers surveying allotments for peanuts where you'd go out into farms and you'd take these aerial photographs and you'd map out where the peanut fields were and you'd take a planimeter and measure what the area is of that property to find out whether or not they're within there.

24:15.432 --> 24:16.133
limits.

24:16.153 --> 24:22.883
One summer, that was paid just enough to make several hundred dollars, which was considerable to go back to college with.

24:23.845 --> 24:27.290
One summer I went to the East Coast to work on a pipeline.

24:27.510 --> 24:30.494
That was all pipelines back in those days were built by southern boys.

24:30.595 --> 24:32.858
Northerners, they wouldn't do that kind of work.

24:33.319 --> 24:34.781
So we'd go up and build pipelines.

24:34.801 --> 24:38.026
So I started off in Pennsylvania and ended up in Connecticut that summer.

24:38.787 --> 24:40.950
And I made enough money that summer to pay my way through

24:41.858 --> 24:43.641
The whole next year, that was pretty good pay.

24:43.661 --> 24:46.746
That's $1.75 an hour, and that was big time money.

24:46.866 --> 24:52.015
As you recall in round numbers, what did it cost to go to A&M?

24:52.035 --> 24:55.460
I think I'm saying it pretty much straight when I say about $1,000 a year.

24:55.761 --> 24:58.125
And you're talking about room, board, books, tuition, and homework?

24:58.365 --> 24:58.666
Everything.

24:59.727 --> 25:04.816
And one of the blessings, I presume, financially, was the opportunity to wear that uniform.

25:05.377 --> 25:08.642
That clothing didn't add much to that cost.

25:10.158 --> 25:12.941
You mean I could have lived cheaper wearing some other kind of clothes?

25:13.141 --> 25:13.302
No.

25:14.803 --> 25:20.249
That you couldn't have lived much cheaper since you could wear that uniform over and over and over and over.

25:21.311 --> 25:26.196
Well, I never thought of clothing as much of a money saving.

25:26.216 --> 25:29.420
We had a lot of cleaning bills we wouldn't have normally.

25:29.460 --> 25:32.063
We could go to the laundry and just run something through and wear it.

25:32.103 --> 25:34.205
We had to have it all starts and everything.

25:34.225 --> 25:35.727
So our cleaning bills were substantial.

25:35.767 --> 25:39.591
I thought you were talking maybe we made 90 cents a day our last two years by being in the court.

25:40.145 --> 25:41.447
Oh, I forgot that, yeah.

25:41.667 --> 25:43.389
And that was helpful.

25:43.409 --> 25:48.135
Now, these summer jobs, did anybody at A&M help you get any of those jobs?

25:48.335 --> 25:48.556
No.

25:49.937 --> 25:56.946
So that there was no effort in that era to try to give you a summer architectural firm experience?

25:56.966 --> 26:02.473
No, and of course we had one summer set aside, we had to go to ROTC camp until most of summer.

26:02.808 --> 26:06.853
Alright, it's time for me to get out of here and let y'all have lunch.

26:08.155 --> 26:10.538
But before, let's do the important part.

26:10.558 --> 26:14.223
Tell, describe how Cadet Slouch came into being.

26:14.524 --> 26:15.565
Was that while you were a student?

26:16.266 --> 26:18.469
When I was a student, I guess that was my fourth year.

26:19.330 --> 26:23.355
I was a five year architect, a five year major in architecture.

26:23.375 --> 26:26.760
And my fourth year, I was my last year in the Corps.

26:26.780 --> 26:29.203
It was that fall, I went over to

26:31.107 --> 26:34.332
to the battalion office and just said, I've been drawing pictures for a long time.

26:34.352 --> 26:41.543
Would you be interested in some kind of a cartoon contribution of some kind?

26:41.563 --> 26:42.945
And they said, yeah, that'd be a good idea.

26:42.965 --> 26:44.628
I want you to do something.

26:44.648 --> 26:46.651
So I did, and I did a couple of cartoons.

26:46.731 --> 26:48.394
And I said, how about having a character?

26:48.414 --> 26:49.475
I said, well, that'd be good, too.

26:50.397 --> 26:54.083
So then I started drawing this character.

26:54.103 --> 26:59.511
I got, I guess, one of the first ones, Drew, hanging in the room in here.

27:00.335 --> 27:14.768
I did that and named it Cadet Slouch and that's sort of how it got started and then I did it I guess until 1985 maybe, something like that, 1985 and then sort of let it drop off.

27:14.789 --> 27:16.350
So you're saying about 30 years?

27:16.370 --> 27:18.252
33 years, yeah.

27:18.272 --> 27:26.720
Alright, did you think of any other possible names that you might have selected other than Slouch?

27:26.740 --> 27:29.262
I don't remember if I did.

27:29.613 --> 27:38.100
And did Slouch originally look and behave similarly to Slouch later?

27:38.120 --> 27:40.782
Yeah, of course similar, but the evolution took place.

27:41.003 --> 27:41.443
Sure.

27:41.663 --> 27:50.631
As with all cartoon scripts, it refines out and the personality and the features look a little bit more streamlined as time goes by.

27:50.851 --> 27:52.332
Now you didn't do this in high school.

27:53.073 --> 27:59.518
You didn't do a... No, I did drawings, always done artwork and drawings and, you know, silly type drawings.

28:00.224 --> 28:06.871
But I never had an ongoing strip or tried to tell a story or have a situation and a caption under it.

28:07.471 --> 28:12.336
Was there anybody that you had in mind that was the model for Cadet Slouch?

28:12.396 --> 28:17.461
Me.

28:18.562 --> 28:28.172
Do you remember any Cadet Slouch cartoons that you did that somebody in a position of authority disliked?

28:30.886 --> 28:32.408
You know, that was a funny situation.

28:32.448 --> 28:33.550
I did several.

28:33.590 --> 28:39.439
You know how you start doing that and you start to have a voice when you do a cartoon.

28:39.459 --> 28:40.360
Words get you in trouble.

28:40.400 --> 28:44.065
Cartoons, you get by a dam or anything.

28:44.085 --> 28:49.453
And I did a couple of them trying to poke fun at somebody, nibble around the edges, and he's like, hey, won't you do some old so-and-so?

28:49.473 --> 28:50.595
Yeah, go get him.

28:50.675 --> 28:53.960
Like a schoolyard, you can whip him, go get in there and find him.

28:53.980 --> 28:56.083
So they almost dared me to make fun of him.

28:56.249 --> 28:59.794
one of the guys in ROTC, and I did one of these recognizable caricatures.

28:59.834 --> 29:03.760
You know, he got up in class one time and said, you don't like to hear an arcades open, one of those sort of things.

29:04.682 --> 29:06.104
I put him in print doing that.

29:07.967 --> 29:12.453
You know, it got to be where everybody I had in class as a teacher wanted to be featured in it.

29:12.474 --> 29:13.275
Oh, really?

29:14.016 --> 29:18.983
Yeah, they kept saying, hey, you know, have you ever thought about doing one with this subject here?

29:19.003 --> 29:20.926
I said, damn, that's strange, that's a subject you teach.

29:20.946 --> 29:22.088
Well, you know, well,

29:22.574 --> 29:29.445
And that became, it was amazing how everyone, if you spell their name right, you know, that's all they want.

29:29.906 --> 29:30.507
Put me in there.

29:30.908 --> 29:37.278
Did any dean or president or anything ever kind of give a sharp word to you about?

29:37.538 --> 29:37.819
Never.

29:38.119 --> 29:38.400
Never?

29:39.582 --> 29:42.787
You never, President Rudder or Williams or anybody, never?

29:42.807 --> 29:45.692
Or Dean Benson?

29:45.872 --> 29:46.072
Never.

29:46.092 --> 29:46.793
Okay, all right.

29:47.314 --> 29:48.396
Never.

29:48.612 --> 29:52.575
Of course, I never tried doing anything that was deserving of that.

29:54.037 --> 30:01.823
I always tried to make things look sort of silly, but I didn't want to do anything that people would be ashamed of.

30:02.003 --> 30:06.687
You did a cartoon for Ranger, when Ranger died.

30:06.707 --> 30:08.329
Mr. Rudder's dog, you remember?

30:09.049 --> 30:12.312
And you gave that cartoon to the Rudders.

30:12.452 --> 30:13.533
Do you remember that?

30:13.553 --> 30:15.154
I have, yeah.

30:15.174 --> 30:18.197
What was your... Let's make believe now that we're...

30:18.717 --> 30:26.007
the board of editors of the paper, and we're saying, describe the philosophy behind Slouch.

30:26.027 --> 30:28.210
What were you trying to do with Cadet Slouch?

30:31.995 --> 30:37.102
I guess what I was trying to do was figure out the next cartoon.

30:38.264 --> 30:40.947
If you do it every day, that gets to be a strain.

30:41.668 --> 30:47.897
You know, beat cymbals, swing your knees, play a violin, and beat the drum all at one time.

30:48.248 --> 30:49.750
I never had time to do it right.

30:49.770 --> 30:52.833
I was just barely getting by the next one.

30:52.914 --> 31:09.273
So I had no philosophy as such except just reflecting what the campus was doing and what the students were doing and trying to, I guess, point out situations once in a while that could be easily corrected if you did.

31:10.374 --> 31:16.922
Like the doors that were latched like we were talking about over there or some situation that wasn't

31:17.240 --> 31:20.728
That could, by somebody who stroking a pen could make it better if you could do that.

31:21.249 --> 31:22.813
That was the only good you could ever do.

31:22.833 --> 31:25.599
And the rest of it was just making fun of the life we had.

31:28.306 --> 31:31.553
But you were trying to bring a smile.
