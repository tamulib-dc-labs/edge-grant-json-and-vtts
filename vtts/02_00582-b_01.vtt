WEBVTT

00:01.094 --> 00:08.283
I just...

00:01.094 --> 00:08.283
Buck, did you find the agency too confining to work 
for? It sort of bothers me that you kind of come and

00:08.343 --> 00:12.508
go with such regularity in the agency. Was that 
what was wrong? Yeah, it was just, no, it's the same

00:13.749 --> 00:16.433
thing, a sense of freedom. I didn't want to, I felt 
like I was incumbent with the agency, but now and

00:16.453 --> 00:21.639
then I just get worried of it. I mean, the type of 
work I was doing, assignments. What I was trying to

00:24.122 --> 00:26.545
get away with myself, just no more assignments. 
Which I did not. Only as an assignment I took on with

00:28.168 --> 00:32.792
this A&M one, but I haven't, I don't take any more. 
But just did what other prevailed of it, John Lentz

00:32.812 --> 00:39.919
and Bucky, other Aggie alumni, there was an artist 
and it's up to you to do it, and it kept on. I said,

00:39.939 --> 00:40.960
okay, I'll do it. But I didn't want it. Because I was 
afraid of it. I was more or less, didn't have free

00:47.125 --> 00:50.568
reign, but they let me go. But I had some things I 
wanted to put in there. I still have some of my best

00:52.290 --> 00:56.093
subjects that I haven't, Because I feel small 
ones. Oh my God, the beautiful things I've done.

01:00.802 --> 01:03.426
It's like when I'm taking a roadie at the hospital. 
All I knew was acting polo and all that type of

01:04.047 --> 01:07.552
thing. But I still have them filming. The bonfire, 
I stayed with that for a week, just watching that.

01:12.199 --> 01:14.562
But I've got all those sketches of that, but I never 
have. I've lost the focus. I haven't done the

01:16.605 --> 01:17.467
library. Some of the library I want to work on. But I 
couldn't do them all. It was eight. They finally

01:21.166 --> 01:28.296
started with 40, went to six, and then to eight, 
because it'll take 15 or 20 to really cope with this

01:21.166 --> 01:28.296
thing. But I'd rather do it now and do some more, but 
on my own volition. I'm doing this for boxing.

01:34.465 --> 01:35.286
Well, I have to do that. I'm doing it for boxing. If 
somebody is behind me or stipulating anything, I

01:36.868 --> 01:40.874
fold up. I'm conscious somebody's going to say, 
hey, I believe you better do it. But I won't do it.

01:46.201 --> 01:47.503
I'm protecting myself. Mm-hmm. And you think 
that's because of the agency work? You think the

01:50.348 --> 01:52.892
pressure working with the agency all that time? 
Oh, yeah. It was something. It had a lot to do with

01:55.437 --> 01:57.260
it. But yeah, I've had free reign to do it. I don't 
want to actually do this type of thing. But I've got

02:00.726 --> 02:01.848
some other things. But I'll do them on my own. 
Mostly action things. How did your marriage

02:06.035 --> 02:08.479
survive under the pressure of the agency? You 
seemed to have been gone all the time. Oh, no. Two

02:12.346 --> 02:12.807
months. I was out on road trips for quite a bit, 
maybe a week or so at a time, but at the time I was gone

02:13.934 --> 02:19.184
for three weeks at most, I believe. Then I took on 
some other work, back to Interwoven, up in the

02:19.745 --> 02:23.512
Matthews Ranch. And then Book, and then with Carl 
Hurt, I was a pastor a week. That was a beautiful

02:28.581 --> 02:32.548
assignment, but I loved it. But, oh no, I just, I 
don't want any more. But I don't know. Which way to

02:38.774 --> 02:39.655
go? Sometimes I just don't know. I'm still 
restless, isn't

02:41.858 --> 02:46.123
it? When did you go? You go to Italy when? You do a 
series of things, an Italian series? Oh, I did a

02:50.629 --> 02:51.550
tremendous lot of Italian. I stayed in Italy about 
two months, but I, God, I turned out a hundred or so

02:51.570 --> 02:56.817
in one of those. Every day. I was so enthralled with 
the same that I just, and then I'm really, and

03:00.897 --> 03:08.245
essentially in Rome, there's Florence, and I went 
to Venice, I just, I'll case the boot. And I get, oh

03:09.406 --> 03:11.548
God, the material. And Ford, all Britain here, has 
this place out here, I don't know what the region

03:11.568 --> 03:20.558
was, has the biggest collection of Italian 
things. How did you decide upon Italy? My brother

03:22.620 --> 03:29.727
was, he was in Italy for 12 years, a sculptor, he was 
the head of the Department of Sculpture in Rome,

03:22.620 --> 03:29.727
the Academy in Rome. Oh, he's a Because my brother, 
that's another thing, but he was, I think, a

03:30.665 --> 03:38.061
top-ranking sculptor, because he died in 1971 in 
America. Oh, he's tremendous. He started in Carl

03:40.286 --> 03:41.689
Miller's. He was in Sweden, in the court with King 
Gustav, doing fine. But he's the one that's had a

03:46.223 --> 03:48.226
career that's colorful. But I was with him two 
months. But I had plans with him, because that's

03:49.668 --> 03:56.639
what, God, when he died, I think another segment of 
my world just dropped away. Because I felt he was so

03:56.659 --> 04:02.648
strong with key to key, I think, and everything I 
moved. But, man, it was a joy. But we had great

04:05.472 --> 04:09.057
plans, wasn't it, to work together, get a studio 
scene. We thought about hunting, and he said,

04:09.077 --> 04:13.504
somewhere I want a place where I can do my casting. 
Let's work, let's be together. That was taken care

04:17.408 --> 04:18.510
of. How many children were there in your family? 
Five. Five. That's what I thought. Poor boy and his

04:24.858 --> 04:25.860
sister. She died. And how many of you went into art? 
Well, to be truthful with you, the only one that

04:30.306 --> 04:33.971
didn't was my sister. Now Ted, my brother, he just 
started going to the porcelains, like ceramics.

04:41.001 --> 04:42.984
There's one in the center, that white one in there. 
I think it was Wayne's office. And Pete, my

04:45.267 --> 04:47.230
brother, was his He got him to sculpt it. He didn't 
know he hadn't, he was never going to do it until

04:50.507 --> 04:56.919
Rube Lee did sculpt one of his pieces. He was 
driving a truck in Cuero. And he was doing a

04:58.382 --> 05:01.167
sculpture on the side. And he was doing these 
magnificent things. And she saw the plasma. God,

05:04.373 --> 05:05.154
look at that. That man got the touch. Because she 
knew sculpture was a good one. So that's when we Got

05:09.822 --> 05:14.229
him out of Cuero in a hurry and put him to work with 
Bill McVeigh, now he's teaching in the museum. And

05:14.249 --> 05:20.239
he came rolling up and he went to see Millis, the top 
man in the world, from Sweden, called Millis in

05:14.249 --> 05:20.239
Cranbrook. And Carl's always waiting, took him in 
a paper sack, took one head of him, got on the bus, we

05:20.760 --> 05:27.752
sent him up there, are you going to call Millis? 
Rupert Lee was my wife. And Millis said, my God, my

05:30.476 --> 05:34.883
boy, I think I can use you, I've been waiting for 
you. What's he sent, I don't know, So he went,

05:36.873 --> 05:41.018
stayed with Miller's Guard, and he went through 
the Second World War, Pete did. He was, he got

05:41.058 --> 05:42.600
killed then. He was right in the middle of the 
Battle of the Bulge and everything, but he was, but

05:42.620 --> 05:50.250
he just got to squeak through that, right in 
action. But he came back, he was a wreck too. Oh,

05:52.133 --> 05:53.274
God, he was a wreck. But I took him in, told, we tried 
to take him to Cuero, and my mother said, Buck, you

05:54.676 --> 06:05.310
just have to do something with him, because we 
can't, he can't, he just was, just an almost a

05:54.676 --> 06:05.310
raving maniac. Was it from being shell-shocked? 
Shell-shocked and no communication in Cuero. He

06:10.605 --> 06:14.229
tried to bring a lot of people in, more or less in the 
art world. I'm that way to service, but not like he

06:14.249 --> 06:17.593
was. But an operator to Houston had kept him here 
once, and he wanted to go back there. And he had some

06:24.560 --> 06:27.384
nice contacts, but he came there. He went one year 
to A&M. He said, this is not my cup of tea. Hell, I'll

06:30.647 --> 06:31.568
get out of here. I said, why didn't you see it on 
television? I said, I don't want to. I said, I loved

06:34.639 --> 06:35.340
it. He's been around these people, Pete McGrath. 
The association didn't have to be on. But he

06:40.787 --> 06:41.288
didn't. He said he was. But he was a delightful 
person. Now he's the one who went on to Italy and

06:45.874 --> 06:48.237
worked in sculpture. All right. Now what about 
your third brother? Dave is not, he was a

06:51.842 --> 06:55.086
mechanical engineer. He graduated in 25. But he 
was a wonderful craftsman, Woodward. He got into

07:01.214 --> 07:02.757
woodwork, built his own thing. He went to 
Charlotte, North Carolina with the Oak

07:02.777 --> 07:06.341
Manufacturing. You know, and he was there, he 
married there, he got a home. Then he started in

07:08.284 --> 07:10.547
woodwork. That thing down, he'd done some 
beautiful furniture and things. But the base of

07:13.731 --> 07:18.278
that tree, insect and tree in the middle, that's 
what Pete did. I don't know whether he ever cast

07:18.838 --> 07:21.081
that thing. I don't know. God almighty. But 
anyhow, he made the base. And Dave does a lot of

07:24.005 --> 07:27.390
furniture with this on his own. But he hasn't got a 
feeling for art at all. But there was another

07:31.692 --> 07:34.416
manifestation of what you call it. There still is 
Christ. Only one that didn't. They say Ted's a

07:37.962 --> 07:43.831
ceramic, but there's these ceramic buddies. So 
the talent was there, but the main thing is to go to

07:43.851 --> 07:50.000
prove that you can have all the talent in the world 
that can remain latent. Sometimes an artist,

07:50.921 --> 07:56.550
unless you have tremendous desire to go ahead with 
it, you'll die on the vine. You had to have a lift,

07:57.577 --> 08:03.163
and we took Pete off that truck and sent him on to the 
platform. And I never did, I just went on my own most

08:04.204 --> 08:07.248
of the time. I got some help in here, and people say 
it was relative, I don't know how it was. I get some

08:12.073 --> 08:19.881
plaudits now and then, but you had to have 
constructive help, I guess, wasn't anything

08:12.073 --> 08:19.881
else, just innate feeling. And I get a lot of that 
here, even with Frank and Wayne. It's associated,

08:25.522 --> 08:30.227
see, but in the octet, it shouldn't be up there. 
Anyhow, and Sharon Steen, I don't know what's her

08:30.488 --> 08:45.104
name, but she's the one that sent the feeling of all 
this encouragement, just the right thing, but how

08:30.488 --> 08:45.104
is it that the percent is one of the most remarkable 
women I've ever met in my life? But she's running

08:46.626 --> 08:51.852
for mayor, put her on now. And God, But they gave me 
this place, and until you see it, you don't see

08:54.732 --> 08:59.617
where we went. Extremely went through to get a spot 
for me. They put this old filling station up there,

09:02.080 --> 09:10.029
moved it in, west off, convey with it. It was a mess, 
filthy mess. Took it, made a pad, and stood you out

09:13.272 --> 09:15.475
of it. That's my, that's my, that's my... I call it 
my domain, but I've got, it's on 1100 acres, I'm

09:21.125 --> 09:33.025
right in the middle of it out there, and I've got 60 
beautiful cattle, crossbred cattle that belong

09:21.125 --> 09:33.025
to Jeff, and Jeff's a freshman at A&M. And then a 
coyote tonight, but it's an ultimate time, it's

09:34.327 --> 09:40.998
rather desolate, I'll tell you that, but I don't 
know. What was your father's reaction to all you

09:41.018 --> 09:43.922
guys going into art? Did he? He just tolerated it. I 
thought maybe after you broke the ground. I broke

09:50.736 --> 09:52.037
the ground, yes. And I broke it for Pete. Pete 
didn't want to go there. He may have given it a try.

09:57.143 --> 09:58.985
And I broke the ground in a lot of ways. I took a lot of 
that discipline. I was on heavy discipline all the

10:00.767 --> 10:05.272
time, but I gave unmedicated help, too. I mean, I 
really did. Oh, my God. I mean, the thing. Just

10:08.395 --> 10:09.897
running away all the time. Escape complex. I rode 
freight. I didn't appear every damn weekend. I

10:14.082 --> 10:15.263
kept the freight and go somewhere. Fritz Handler 
had his little garden class out there where we did

10:16.492 --> 10:20.920
our landscaping. I'd be going by, there was about 
one place, H&TC would come through. He said, put

10:27.072 --> 10:28.835
your hoe down, Buck, there it is. I'd get on, I'd go 
down somewhere. Did you pick out any place in

10:32.121 --> 10:34.806
particular, or just go over? No, I didn't. Well, 
that's another thing. Because it had its

10:38.665 --> 10:43.210
compensations, because that's where I got to see 
my Texas, didn't have a car. But even the Mahe oil

10:43.631 --> 10:47.235
fields, I knew about those at night. I was here at 
oil fields at night. So I took, I got on a cow catcher

10:48.957 --> 10:54.824
here in H&TC, one of them, because they stopped 
putting me off. But then I saw my first oil field at

10:54.844 --> 11:01.652
night around Mahe, across the canyon.

11:04.349 --> 11:07.231
But I, I, but it was just, it's a tremendous 
restlessness. That's when, of course, I was the

11:07.251 --> 11:16.980
beachcomber down in, you know, Magnolia, not 
exactly, but I lived on the coast with the old

11:07.251 --> 11:16.980
oyster fishermen and tents and goat milk and 
everything else. But the line just...

11:17.000 --> 11:27.288
Now, when you, when you just, when you just caught 
this freight and went out someplace, did you draw

11:17.000 --> 11:27.288
while you were out there? Just, just looked? Just 
looked. Put it here. I do a lot of that. I photograph

11:31.772 --> 11:32.753
my mind. I can drive through the country. and start 
the camera snapping thing down, come back here and

11:34.640 --> 11:39.025
almost put it down. I taught, I teach my class that, 
to just go here and just concentrate,

11:39.125 --> 11:44.071
concentrate. Focus on your mind, if it's exciting 
enough. But I do a lot of that. I can come back and

11:47.535 --> 11:57.347
almost, I'll miss some aspects of it, but I do that 
quite often, because as soon as I get there, I don't

11:47.535 --> 11:57.347
have a camera with me.

11:59.129 --> 12:00.410
I just have to make a feel about it. Now the night, 
no, not the other night, excuse me, but the other

12:00.430 --> 12:04.275
day, A few weeks ago, we went down, called Kruger, 
my, it was Polly's son, Al, Aggie style, but he

12:04.492 --> 12:14.822
called me and said, Buck, come on down here. I said, 
boy, we've got, we've been having beautiful

12:14.842 --> 12:17.424
weather. Maybe we'll have this weekend in the 
hooping cranes. Maybe we can see them. Close to

12:21.127 --> 12:21.588
there. So I have seen them before, but the way out in 
the marsh, it's the head sticking up. And he said,

12:25.692 --> 12:26.332
come on. And I went down, and I have a, he only had one 
of his condominiums. I mean, it's my, anytime I

12:29.175 --> 12:30.396
wanted. So I went down there, and We went out that 
Sunday morning. All of a sudden we saw one or two of

12:35.327 --> 12:40.875
them marching just around a spit there. And of 
course the command was the same spit. And there

12:42.798 --> 12:44.841
were seven of them. The closest you'll ever see the 
darn thing. And they were cavorting around. But

12:49.347 --> 12:51.871
usually you never see it with three together. But I 
went out, of course, I made a number of sketches. I

12:53.914 --> 12:55.015
didn't take pictures. Some of them, you couldn't, 
it was too far away. But I put it all down. That's

12:58.280 --> 12:59.862
what I had in my field notes. different ones. I'll 
put, from that I'll go on, I'll make it some nature

13:00.874 --> 13:04.417
studies up close. But I got the antics and 
everything, the way they behaved. But I didn't, I

13:06.819 --> 13:11.504
sat in that boat, sketch, sketch, sketch, talked 
to all the people down there. Then I found a

13:11.524 --> 13:18.871
beautiful array of, oh, hundreds and hundreds of 
white pelicans were soaring above it with

13:11.524 --> 13:18.871
buzzards. And all of a sudden they came down and got 
on this spit of land. Oh, here it is, right here.

13:25.257 --> 13:27.199
This was quick, you know.

13:31.347 --> 13:36.955
That's a

13:31.347 --> 13:36.955
gorgeous book. And so you can remember things like 
that and just come back and do it. Good heavens. Did

13:44.264 --> 13:46.427
it just come through practice? Was it because you 
were working in the daytime? We were doing so many

13:49.091 --> 13:51.394
of them. Hundreds and hundreds of times. And all 
I'm feeling, God, this one is just great. I had an

13:58.313 --> 14:00.095
unusual one I got the other day. It's funny, but 
it's not essential. But I was down in Seafloor and I

14:01.757 --> 14:06.784
found this little vent here and an oleander bush 
was coming out. It was called a Maverick Oleander,

14:06.804 --> 14:10.588
but I found that down there. I've been doing these 
all day, and then I saw a pencil, and I got this at

14:10.608 --> 14:14.193
Lyons. There's no gin there, just a shack that, 
well, Haskell closed by, so I got on down there. But

14:20.941 --> 14:25.707
it's just things like this, and I don't know if it's 
a particular, but it's just a documentary type.

14:25.727 --> 14:26.548
But my gins, I have a feast for them, the old gems, 
with the stacks. I mean, I have a collection of

14:30.766 --> 14:37.171
about 100 of the old gems, and I don't know where to 
put them down. Oh, good. You're going to do all

14:38.212 --> 14:39.794
those for a book? No, I'll just be sitting. Maybe 
get a book out of it later on. I mean, just on that one

14:43.097 --> 14:46.320
premise, on the gems. But I do it because I do it. A 
cotton man will buy them like nobody did. Yeah.

14:51.564 --> 14:55.708
I've always got a lot of papers this far. I don't do 
anything for that time. I just do it for a living.

14:59.651 --> 15:00.613
The new jens you can have. I've been out on the site. 
I just plate them and take all the new electric

15:01.574 --> 15:04.097
jens. They just leave me cold. But the old jens? Oh, 
yeah. God. Oh, they got that composition. One down

15:10.426 --> 15:11.407
in Cuero. I'm going to do that one. Or in Yorktown. I 
sold all those. Do you think all your architecture

15:18.277 --> 15:22.743
training helped you get these kinds of ideas? This 
is essentially architecture. I don't like

15:26.249 --> 15:28.512
architecture as a whole. I like restorations. I go 
down to these places like Round Top and off there

15:29.794 --> 15:35.881
and through there, and I've got a whole series that 
I don't have anymore. But I just put those down. And

15:41.528 --> 15:43.831
architecture cleaning has helped, but I don't 
like anything slick. People call up and say, hey, I

15:43.871 --> 15:50.199
could just restore the new house down at Round Top 
or Felt or Burton in the city. It's all slicked up

15:50.240 --> 15:51.781
beautifully. I said, I'm sorry, but I preferred 
when it was under was punished. I mean, that's

15:55.650 --> 15:58.014
where, yeah. But I don't like to do, oh, I get calls 
all the time. People are so proud. It's wonderful

16:02.462 --> 16:05.747
that they're restoring them and keeping them 
intact. Beautiful. But it don't make, go for

16:06.869 --> 16:10.094
subject matter to me. Sometimes, I like old brick, 
but, but restoration, that's another one of the

16:10.114 --> 16:21.433
facets I've gotten into the help on, We're keeping 
things intact, but essentially courthouses.

16:26.083 --> 16:29.447
I've done that, a square courthouse I've ever 
contacted, on Dewitt County. And I found out about

16:29.867 --> 16:32.570
that, and I went and met with some of the women. I 
said, my God, don't do that. And I ran some more of

16:34.453 --> 16:47.007
this campaign for just keeping out a facade and 
refurbishing the interior, make the modern out

16:34.453 --> 16:47.007
with glass petitions and everything, actually 
lower the ceiling. Oh, it fought me. God, it gave me

16:48.949 --> 16:50.391
hell. And finally they did accomplish it, but it 
cost them so much money, they were just mad

16:50.894 --> 16:55.760
furious. And they said, oh Lord, I created a wave of 
indignation. But anyhow, now they just

17:01.066 --> 17:03.468
completely have it. And it's comfortable, and 
they feel important, you know, they don't have the

17:03.909 --> 17:09.055
old stinky, dark woodwork. But no, everybody's 
very happy. In Victoria, they were going to tear it

17:10.837 --> 17:12.358
down. I wrote an editorial, and they kept calling 
on me. And Dallas wanted me to keep there, of

17:15.902 --> 17:18.285
course. But I just can't allocate all my time to 
that, because I'd rather continue with what I have

17:18.721 --> 17:25.629
to do. That's my art. But this is important, 
though. It's contributing. I think that's a great

17:30.615 --> 17:34.079
thing. It's so essential, I think, that while you 
go along, instead of being so self-centered and

17:34.419 --> 17:41.047
selfish, but go ahead and contribute. I don't care 
what it is, whether it's any causes, right? A lot of

17:44.150 --> 17:46.553
things, too. Restorations. Do you find yourself 
more productive now or less productive? I think

17:52.813 --> 17:54.957
I'm more productive. I think about 180 degree turn 
almost. Because I had a path operation, but I had a

17:57.240 --> 18:00.345
time coming up. But I won't go into it, but the seams 
broke on it, and then we opened up everything, and

18:00.425 --> 18:07.977
infection, blood clots, and the one thing after 
that. But I don't know if I've got it behind me now. I

18:11.041 --> 18:13.605
feel just about as productive as I was in my life. 
Maybe more so. Do you feel like that you've Or now

18:17.783 --> 18:24.210
that you don't have the pressure of the agency 
behind you, do you feel like you have more time to do

18:17.783 --> 18:24.210
it in leisure? Or do you feel pressed now to do 
things? I don't feel pressed. I don't want to be

18:26.933 --> 18:28.274
pressed on anything. Like this book of Frank's. 
I've got time on it, but we're going to use it. Oh, we

18:33.100 --> 18:34.921
had a big meeting yesterday. Use the old stuff, and 
some of this will be used in that. But no pressure.

18:40.247 --> 18:42.369
But I said, Frank, let's go set a deadline. So we'll 
get the things in. a big show in fall of 70s this

18:44.665 --> 18:49.952
year, and then 78 will come out with a book, but not 
this year. I don't want that. If I get the material

18:52.355 --> 18:58.783
into this year, then they can go from then on, 
because I have to do the narration to some extent. I

18:58.823 --> 19:01.947
mean, the research I've done, which I did these 
other two books, but of course they edited. I've

19:03.449 --> 19:10.177
got to put it out, because I have my own vernacular 
in writing, and I do like, like Toby traveled with

19:03.449 --> 19:10.177
him a lot, man. He said, God Almighty, Buckingham 
Butch said the King's English put poetry right

19:12.948 --> 19:15.791
your way. So I don't care. He criticized him. But 
that's another thing. I've had tremendous good

19:20.697 --> 19:22.820
luck. Well, not good luck, but advantage that I 
would travel with Mr. Dobie. People don't know

19:27.645 --> 19:28.486
that. We went out to the field all the time. When did 
you travel with Dobie? Oh, yeah, back in about 10

19:31.350 --> 19:34.113
days ago. Before he died. Oh, I had to escapade with 
him against the doctor's orders when he was a sick

19:35.194 --> 19:40.060
man. I took him out. Oh. But But he was, it was such a 
delight, and the man was so delighted. He went, I

19:46.404 --> 19:49.648
can't tell you the story, too. Several times I took 
his doctor's orders, I took him out. He'd be, but

19:54.414 --> 19:56.176
please do this for me. I'm tired of being on the 
shelf. Well, damn it, you don't have to be on the

19:57.297 --> 19:59.120
shelf. Let's go. And I came back with him. We were 
all at night. Oh, thank God for you. Better if you

20:04.126 --> 20:06.589
like me. And walked away, but I was with him lots of 
times. Better check with him. They're beautiful

20:10.173 --> 20:11.575
people. Whew! That's gone. That's another 
wonderful affiliation I had. But I didn't come

20:20.874 --> 20:27.740
into their lives away until, oh, what's, the 
mid-60s, I guess. But it was a delight. I could

20:30.963 --> 20:33.885
have, if Mr. Dobie had lived, Frank, of course. We 
had lots of things in mind we wanted to do. He wanted

20:37.708 --> 20:41.592
to visit with me, of course. But, gee, it's a joy to 
be with those people. You must have known them in

20:43.702 --> 20:47.106
and around Austin then. Yeah.

20:50.130 --> 20:51.952
Yeah, he had his ranch out there. Of course, now he 
has Bassano at that time. He got a new ranch, bought

20:55.877 --> 20:57.879
some other property. But I went out with Bassano 
quite a few times. And we wanted to go to Beaver and

21:01.944 --> 21:07.571
many places, but his family were brought away. He 
had his ranch, his big ranch. He was a wonderful

21:11.512 --> 21:13.735
fellow. I mean, he could be very raucous and tough, 
but he was kind. He was constructive. But we hit it

21:23.488 --> 21:24.990
off nicely.

21:28.334 --> 21:31.498
Frank Vandervoort, I got closer to him than 
anybody else. I knew him through the UDC work.

21:42.865 --> 21:45.549
But next to home, I take it from here. I think that 
you'll go back to Quirrell then for a while and work

21:45.629 --> 21:49.516
around there. Do you intend to stick with 
primarily native Texas scenes, Bob? I think I

21:53.342 --> 21:53.702
will. No more battalion scenes? I don't know. Why 
not? Why should I? Can't think of any particular

21:59.271 --> 22:01.134
reason why you should at all? Because this is 
embedded in Portland. It's deep in me, so much of

22:05.261 --> 22:07.745
it. That I go other places, I might do things. Even 
Italy was But the Roman Forum, my God, I was in joy.

22:13.903 --> 22:16.786
1950, 1960, right, just at the Forum. And I don't 
know, they sold, married and sold them off and on

22:17.828 --> 22:22.673
different places in Venice. But I come back, oh, 
it's a huge lift to see the beauty of those things.

22:28.000 --> 22:30.603
And of course, you always think, isn't that what it 
does? Creating your memories, my God. How did they

22:32.725 --> 22:34.147
build the Colosseum? Just look at the heart. And 
it's an odd violin, my God. But it doesn't come back

22:39.835 --> 22:41.177
here. But this is, there's so much Texas has to 
contribute yet. I want to put out a document or

22:47.105 --> 22:49.127
whatever it is. I think that's my slide. Let's just 
put it that way. I think this is what you should do as

22:51.370 --> 22:56.197
so designated by the man above. You think an artist 
ought to do things in his regions, things he has an

22:56.877 --> 23:02.345
emotional feel for? No, I don't think I would. 
Whatever comes off with you, I mean, it excites

23:03.887 --> 23:09.454
you, it stimulates you, inspires you. No. I don't 
believe that. You have to, because I am more of a

23:12.097 --> 23:16.162
dedicated Texan than most artists. On average, 
artists don't give a tank a damn about Texas. They

23:19.046 --> 23:19.727
don't history. They don't, but you have to study 
the history and know it. Probe it. Talk to people.

23:25.635 --> 23:30.963
No, I, so much that's done, my art is just for 
pictorial sense. It's called Superman. I'd be

23:32.325 --> 23:35.008
superficial, but it's scenic entirely. But 
there's much more in it. Especially if you do

23:37.565 --> 23:44.555
housework, you have to be able to walk into a door 
and see how inside a window, but there's just a heck

23:37.565 --> 23:44.555
of a lot there. It's hard to describe. But you feel 
it. Oh, thanks God, because I love the coast. I've

23:52.025 --> 23:54.088
been having some escapades on the coast. I've been 
through one of the hurricanes. I really did barely

23:55.270 --> 23:56.832
squeak through. If I ride it out, I learned the hard 
way. But I found, God, it was magnificent.

24:07.417 --> 24:10.820
I don't know, it's a thing like challenges, 
challenges, challenges. What do you need of them?

24:13.462 --> 24:14.203
Give you stimulus. Do you think in a way, Buck, that 
you'll be preserving past Texas culture in the

24:16.125 --> 24:22.250
sense of this work? How me? I

24:22.771 --> 24:26.334
don't know. It's a very wonderful culture. I look 
at Elizabeth and I, because she did all this

24:27.755 --> 24:31.499
statuary, what she has been doing. We did that, but 
she's a more or less of a known entity in the eyes of

24:31.519 --> 24:36.343
the modern art world. I'm going to do welding 
stuff, crap. I thought, hell with you. Guy's going

24:40.609 --> 24:43.293
to do welding, I'll do it too. Pete and I said, let's 
make my place at home. Just the junk, you ought to

24:45.697 --> 24:47.379
weld it. And I wouldn't want to do it, just for the 
hell of it. I like some of it, but I think it'd be fun.

24:55.933 --> 24:58.116
It would be, Pete and I want to do it together. I 
said, let's go ahead. They think it's so damn good,

24:59.178 --> 25:01.401
let's show them we're better.

25:04.706 --> 25:05.267
Oh, it's good. I don't know if they're going to stay 
South American. It's hard to get serious. You keep

25:16.507 --> 25:19.110
a sense of humor. God knows. That is so important. 
You think that would be the advice you'd give to a

25:23.036 --> 25:26.660
young artist, to always keep a sense of humor? I 
think to some extent. But they're too serious.

25:29.043 --> 25:30.185
Most of them are. They're highly sensitive. They 
react to any kind of adverse criticism. You have to

25:35.099 --> 25:36.420
be more than an artist. You've got to be a human 
being, a strong one. That's it. And if you want to be

25:42.106 --> 25:45.330
associated with the cedar choppers, which I do. Of 
course, I'm not going to go out and oil raid with

25:45.350 --> 25:48.593
them. It's the roughest element you can find in 
mankind, and you'll see what that... They all

25:52.457 --> 25:53.738
contribute to him. Maybe Holmes' one philosophy 
about it,

25:53.758 --> 26:03.368
but I don't know. I feel sorry for the average 
artist. I don't think they had the opportunity. I

26:07.826 --> 26:08.987
feel sorry for them. It's a shame they can't, 
whether they could accept things that I've been

26:09.067 --> 26:12.491
through. I don't know. It's hard to tell. But 
that's a whole other subject. I look at everything

26:17.497 --> 26:23.364
as a new adventure, and there's something that's 
different than, you know, like I said, the

26:17.497 --> 26:23.364
assignment's over with me. Everything's on my own 
volition. But did you ever think about going to

26:25.947 --> 26:29.071
Europe and doing work in the 20s? Europe? Yeah. No. 
Never worked, right? Did it go over there? I had

26:34.229 --> 26:35.150
sandwiches. I could have been sent over there, but 
even the architect playing with Tompkins Swain

26:35.331 --> 26:44.084
would go there and take a look at some ironwork in 
Spain.

26:46.447 --> 26:51.675
I, right now, I think I was foolish not doing it, but 
I was a little bit skittish about what I did. If I'd

26:53.618 --> 26:56.743
have gone with somebody, I think maybe I should 
have done something, I don't know. I don't look

26:57.213 --> 26:58.716
back at anything. Whatever happened, happened. 
It was for a purpose. My pattern's been laying,

27:01.500 --> 27:08.512
whatever the pattern was like, the schedule, 
whatever.

27:08.693 --> 27:13.881
I don't like

27:08.693 --> 27:13.881
planning anything anymore. My deadline's too 
long.
