WEBVTT

00:02.478 --> 00:03.679
and they need some help. And I said, well, what do 
you want me to do? He said, I would like for you to

00:09.725 --> 00:23.079
tutor them in English, accounting, and algebra.

00:23.099 --> 00:30.426
And I said, I don't know if I can do that because, you 
know, we've got to I just got married and we've got a

00:31.115 --> 00:37.425
heavy spring load coming up here in track. And he 
said, we will pay you $1 per student per hour. I

00:46.199 --> 00:47.741
said, dog, you've got a deal. So I had four or five 
students in each subject. And I went downtown in

00:55.894 --> 00:58.759
Bryan and rented an old Victor Comptometer that 
had the arm on it you would pull to use as an

00:59.363 --> 01:09.775
addition, subtraction, and multiplying 
function for accounting. And I would teach those

01:10.976 --> 01:20.426
guys the double entry method of accounting that 
Homer Adams, class of 45, taught us. So you're a

01:20.827 --> 01:23.250
freshman helping freshmen. That's right. And Dog 
figured it'd be better that way, you know, I was one

01:29.418 --> 01:30.319
of them. They were one of us. And they were having to 
repeat first semester accounting, algebra, and

01:32.802 --> 01:42.455
English. So by the end of the course, they all 
passed. I think the lowest grade any of them made

01:48.222 --> 01:51.867
was a C. Yeah, pretty good. So it worked. Where did 
you do this physically? In H-Ramp. of Hart Hall

01:59.438 --> 02:28.264
there was a lounge on the first floor and couches 
and chairs and a table or two and a coke machine and

01:59.438 --> 02:28.264
we'd get over in the corner at this chair and we'd 
sit there and I would drum into them about rhetoric

01:59.438 --> 02:28.264
composition and punctuation and cut off your 
dangling participles and use a semicolon instead

01:59.438 --> 02:28.264
of a colon and You know, use an apostrophe where it 
belongs. Make sure you don't put the word only in

02:33.182 --> 02:38.449
the wrong position as a modifier. Those kinds of 
things that we all learned in high school, but some

02:38.549 --> 02:55.331
of the guys didn't have the advantage

02:38.549 --> 02:55.331
from the smaller schools, didn't have the 
advantage of good instruction, or they just

02:38.549 --> 02:55.331
disregarded punctuation and spelling 
altogether. Did you do that later semesters or

02:55.631 --> 02:59.196
just that one time? Just that one time,

02:59.530 --> 03:04.499
well, I take that back. In my sophomore year, dog 
came to me again and asked me to tutor a couple of

03:04.579 --> 03:16.200
guys in accounting, which I was very happy to do 
under the same arrangement. I sure could use the

03:16.220 --> 03:19.747
money. Let's see, we mentioned also a while ago, 
Now, you didn't have to worry about having a date

03:23.459 --> 03:27.324
because you had a wife pretty quickly. Oh, yeah. 
But how did the other guys get dates, and how did

03:28.166 --> 03:35.175
they make links with the Tessie girls and so forth? 
Well, some of the guys got dates from downtown

03:35.195 --> 03:52.960
Bryan, but they were sort of few and far between 
because, after all, you've got 5,000 bachelors

03:35.195 --> 03:52.960
and 1,000 married guys out here on the campus. 
Those 5,000 bachelors, if they're hometown

03:53.395 --> 03:58.880
sweethearts, you're not coming up here to see them 
on the weekend. They're going to go down to Bryan

03:59.320 --> 04:02.883
and see what's available down there. And that 
ratio gets pretty thin and out of kilter. The

04:08.328 --> 04:09.689
Tessies would come down. And a lot of the Aggies had 
girlfriends at TSCW. And they would come down on

04:14.854 --> 04:17.036
the train. But one of the things that you could 
count on at every home football game and

04:24.293 --> 04:54.047
particularly at Sabisa Hall, I couldn't speak for 
Duncan Hall over on the other side of the campus,

04:24.293 --> 04:54.047
but at Sabisa Hall where all the athletes ate, 
about noon on football Saturdays, two or three

04:24.293 --> 04:54.047
buses would pull up from TSCW, the driver would 
open those doors, and those girls would come

04:24.293 --> 04:54.047
fogging off of that bus, screaming and giggling 
and laughing at the top of their lungs, and they

04:54.382 --> 05:06.216
would see these freshmen and sophomores and 
juniors walking around, leaving Savisa on their

04:54.382 --> 05:06.216
way back to their dorms to get ready for the march 
in. And you talk about a jailbreak. The guys would

05:12.002 --> 05:23.275
look over their shoulders and see these girls 
getting off the bus, and to be charitable, I'm sure

05:12.002 --> 05:23.275
they were nice girls. But I wouldn't have cared to 
date any of them. But they sure could run fast. And

05:31.668 --> 05:36.736
they would capture dates, literally capture 
them. And the guys would take them to the ball game,

05:37.016 --> 05:42.825
and they'd have dates that night, and we'd have a 
dance later on. And a good time was had by all, I

05:42.885 --> 05:45.950
suppose.

05:48.574 --> 05:52.840
Some of the big-time groups that came here to 
perform, who were some of those people? Big

05:53.528 --> 05:54.450
orchestras. We had Racing with the Moon, Vaughn 
Monroe. We had Les Brown and his band of renown with

05:58.536 --> 06:07.110
Bob Hope and his group of young Hollywood 
starlets. They performed in Kyle Field. Oh,

06:10.676 --> 06:14.943
gee. The Dorseys? No, we didn't have any of the 
Dorseys while we were here. It just escapes me

06:21.895 --> 06:23.357
right now. But we did have some big name bands.

06:29.844 --> 06:31.366
Let's see. OK, now that's all the notes that I made. 
Do you have any other topics you can think of that we

06:35.551 --> 06:38.254
should have?

06:44.982 --> 06:45.343
No. I told you about Bones turning off the lights in 
Kyle Field. Oh, an aside about Bones. Bones was the

06:56.306 --> 07:02.677
class of 25 here at Texas A&M. He was also a 
well-renowned tackle in the Southwest

07:03.619 --> 07:10.832
Conference. My father went to a small 
agricultural It wasn't a college. It was a school

07:18.981 --> 07:21.904
in Russellville, Arkansas. It was called 
Arkansas Polytechnic Institute. What it was

07:29.133 --> 07:44.130
really was just a continuation of a more advanced 
senior high school when he first joined there from

07:29.133 --> 07:44.130
Hendricks College in Conway. He went to Hendricks 
his first year and then transferred to Arkansas

07:44.532 --> 07:58.488
Tech when his folks moved from Danville, Arkansas 
and Yale County to Polk County, Russellville. My

07:58.508 --> 08:12.784
dad was an all-state halfback and the state 102-20 
champion and also all-Arkansas intercollegiate

07:58.508 --> 08:12.784
in baseball. as was the habit of small schools in 
those days, they would get a Pullman car and they

08:12.983 --> 08:27.881
would travel around the United States playing 
bigger teams, offering themselves up to the

08:12.983 --> 08:27.881
slaughter.

08:31.045 --> 08:33.648
But Arkansas Tech was a little different. They had 
some guys that had been playing football there

08:34.950 --> 08:39.295
four, five, and six years. which was illegal in 
those days because there were no rules that

08:39.730 --> 08:43.395
applied to them. And they put together a hell of an 
aggregation of athletes. And they went around

08:49.663 --> 08:57.453
playing bigger schools until these schools 
finally wouldn't play them because they were

08:49.663 --> 08:57.453
afraid of losing on their home ground. Anyhow, 
they came on a swing down through Texas. They

09:01.178 --> 09:03.521
played Austin College. They played Russ College. 
They played Trinity College. And they played

09:10.257 --> 09:14.364
Texas A&M here at Kyle Field. My dad talked about 
the trip, especially here at Kyle Field. It was in

09:21.175 --> 09:22.237
September. It was hot still and of course the train 
had no air conditioning in those days and they

09:23.840 --> 09:32.314
would sleep with the Pullman windows open. 
Mosquitoes were terrible. The coach would stay up

09:36.278 --> 09:42.664
all night burning rags to keep the mosquitoes away 
so the boys could sleep. And my dad said that they

09:42.684 --> 09:56.538
had heard tales, fables, about the terrific 
linemen and hard-hitting backs that Texas A&M

09:42.684 --> 09:56.538
had. One lineman in particular was Bones Irvins. 
He got his name Bones because he broke so many bones

10:01.042 --> 10:05.627
when he tackled. And another was Taro Kishi from 
Orange, Texas. And Taro was a bone-crunching

10:11.912 --> 10:22.747
halfback, although it turned out that Taro 
weighed about 150 pounds, which is about what my

10:11.912 --> 10:22.747
dad weighed. Anyhow, they lined up and played 
against Texas A&M out here. They lost 42 to

10:28.375 --> 10:34.483
nothing, but they gave a pretty good account of 
themselves. And he said he got hit by a bone and said

10:35.358 --> 10:42.585
that was the hardest he'd ever been tackled in his 
life. And that year, later on that same year, this

10:43.706 --> 10:56.139
was 1924, Arkansas

10:43.706 --> 10:56.139
Tech became the first school west of the 
Mississippi to play West Point. They took a train,

10:57.300 --> 11:05.348
special train, from the state of Arkansas up there 
and then played and lost. He said that was his most

11:06.374 --> 11:09.658
memorable experience. And he and Bones talked 
about that in later years when they got

11:09.718 --> 11:16.626
reacquainted when Bones was the AD. Did, when you 
were a student, what did you hear about the 12th man

11:17.507 --> 11:26.638
origin?

11:27.299 --> 11:29.782
Did you hear, did Colonel Andy ever talk about it? 
Did anybody ever talk about the origin of the 12th

11:29.842 --> 11:34.407
man up in the, that game in Dallas? No, Colonel Andy 
never did. The football coaches would, and of

11:36.869 --> 11:44.616
course the Yale leaders. And it was in the cadence. 
Okay. And it was in the Aggieland, which up until my

11:47.378 --> 11:53.864
freshman year had been called the Longhorn. Oh, do 
you have any idea how that change came about? Who

11:59.228 --> 12:00.049
proposed it? How, why?

12:04.103 --> 12:14.658
It occurred between

12:04.103 --> 12:14.658
48 and 49 because the 48-year book was called The 
Longhorn. Oh, so you got here in the... I got here in

12:17.883 --> 12:19.385
the fall of 48. Had it already been decided? Yes, it 
had. It was going to be Aggieland because the

12:22.950 --> 12:28.558
student senate and I guess the I don't know, maybe 
the football players, but certainly the student

12:29.332 --> 12:43.037
senate and a lot of other students on campus said, 
this is crazy, calling our yearbook the Longhorn.

12:43.418 --> 12:52.875
See, and I have assumed that the origin of that name 
for this institution's yearbook predated the

12:43.418 --> 12:52.875
athletic nomenclature. I'll bet that book goes 
back before there were mascot names of Longhorns.

13:03.470 --> 13:07.937
Because I think it goes back to the late 1880s, I 
think. But that's just my guess. I wouldn't be at

13:09.239 --> 13:10.461
all surprised. I don't know when the Longhorns 
started calling themselves the Longhorns. I

13:16.092 --> 13:16.753
don't either. Let's see. All right. Then we'll go 
back to some other things that I had written down.

13:26.343 --> 13:33.110
Your senior ring, you got that in the end of your 
junior year. How much did it cost? Where'd you get

13:36.013 --> 13:36.914
the money? Well, I earned the money by...

13:45.995 --> 13:51.721
Building a sewage system out near Easterwood 
Airport.

13:54.985 --> 14:00.151
I don't know what it was called then, but you would 
call it environmental services or something like

13:54.985 --> 14:00.151
that today. Sanitation engineering.

14:05.677 --> 14:15.107
Between my fall and spring semesters, since I was 
exempt from finals, I would take whatever job I

14:15.408 --> 14:17.670
could get. Well, the engineering extension 
service or whatever branch of that, they were

14:17.830 --> 14:28.519
experimenting with different types of sewage 
disposal. And they had a sludge pit out there where

14:28.539 --> 14:44.453
the big arm would go around the sludge pit and the 
effluent would drain off through a pipe and they

14:28.539 --> 14:44.453
wanted me to construct a flume and fill that flume 
up with gravel and have it go through a series of

14:45.867 --> 15:02.229
twists and turns to see so that they could measure 
the oxygen input at the beginning where it entered

14:45.867 --> 15:02.229
this flume. And I'd have to grade it myself. I had to 
do all the work myself. I had to get it done in two

15:06.796 --> 15:08.418
weeks time. And the thing was about 50 feet

15:16.445 --> 15:22.976
linearly, but with all the twists and turns in it, 
probably a hundred feet. And then they would

15:22.996 --> 15:34.355
measure the oxygen content at the end of the run to 
see whether or not that type of a system would work.

15:35.176 --> 15:36.779
Whether it did or not, I don't know. I just built the 
thing. I didn't use it.

15:43.023 --> 15:47.749
senior ring from that, and I have a receipt here. 
The ring cost $29.84. Tax

15:51.294 --> 15:58.424
included because that was pre-sales tax. How did 
you feel when you put it on? I was on top of the world,

16:01.288 --> 16:11.882
and my father-in-law at the same time gave me the 
money to buy My senior boots. And I bought a used

16:14.599 --> 16:17.402
pair of senior boots. They were in good condition. 
And I had the calves adjusted to fit my legs. They

16:25.709 --> 16:27.331
did that at Hollick's Boot Shop. By what did they 
cost? I paid $60 for a two-year-old set of boots.

16:41.123 --> 16:42.004
Including the spurs. And did you keep those boots 
or did you sell them? I've still got them. You've

16:47.934 --> 16:48.634
still got them. I've got them in a case out in the 
garage. With your ring, have you got any good ring

16:52.098 --> 16:55.562
stories? Did you ever lose it? I lost it for about 
two weeks.

17:04.533 --> 17:08.357
It was about five or six years ago. It was a cold day. 
in Travis County and uh I'd been wearing tight

17:11.195 --> 17:40.054
fitting kid gloves and I came in the house and I was 
taking off my coat and I took off my gloves and

17:11.195 --> 17:40.054
because my hands were so cold my fingers had shrunk 
and the ring slipped off of my finger but I didn't

17:11.195 --> 17:40.054
realize it and uh Later on that night, I realized 
that my ring was missing. And I was really torn up

17:46.683 --> 17:51.890
about it because I prized that ring above 
everything. Plus, my wife had, after I gave her a

17:51.970 --> 18:02.785
bigger diamond, she had given me the diamond out of 
her engagement ring to put in it. Oh, my. And, oh, I

18:04.427 --> 18:06.891
fretted and fretted over that. And about four or 
five months later, I had dropped a piece of the

18:11.337 --> 18:24.193
vacuum cleaner in the hall closet where we kept our 
coats, and the piece of the vacuum cleaner rolled

18:11.337 --> 18:24.193
back behind the door jamb. And I was reaching back 
there for that piece of the vacuum cleaner, and

18:25.234 --> 18:34.125
doggone, that ring wasn't there along with it.

18:35.426 --> 18:40.973
Have you been to some special place ever where 
somebody far, far away recognized Oh, all over the

18:41.442 --> 18:43.225
world. Examples? Oh, examples. Over in Germany, a 
particular job that I had put me in contact with a

18:46.790 --> 18:55.563
lot of Army officers. And of course, I guess there 
were probably more Aggies in the Army than there

18:55.583 --> 19:05.558
were in the Air Force or the Navy.

19:07.521 --> 19:10.926
Aggies are always on the lookout for somebody 
else. with a ring, and we would spot that ring, and

19:11.328 --> 19:19.236
that's just the way it worked out. Other places 
where some non-Aggie spotted it? No, non-Aggie

19:23.660 --> 19:25.602
didn't know what it was. They would admire the 
rings, oh gee, that's a beautiful ring, where's it

19:25.963 --> 19:29.366
from? And I'd explain it to them. Why are Aggie 
rings so special?

19:38.655 --> 19:40.457
That's hard to say. I have noted that Aggie 
seniors, more Aggie seniors wear Aggie rings than

19:42.192 --> 19:57.208
other seniors of other institutions wear their 
senior rings. I don't know whether it's because

19:58.910 --> 20:07.720
of pride or just what it is. I'd have to attribute it 
to a large extent to pride. and what the ring meant

20:12.112 --> 20:19.018
to them personally and what you had to do to get it. 
Now when you put on those senior boots and went to

20:19.618 --> 20:26.624
final review as a junior, how did you feel? On top of 
the world.

20:31.388 --> 20:32.289
On top of the world. Okay, then as a senior, 
describe final review your senior year as you

20:33.050 --> 20:40.256
recall it. Who was here and Let's

20:42.723 --> 20:50.072
see, President Eisenhower was here for final 
review in 1950. Oh, describe that as far as you

20:50.092 --> 20:54.798
remember it. He was the president of Columbia 
University. He was not President Eisenhower at

20:58.222 --> 21:00.565
that time. And he came here to be the reviewing 
officer.

21:09.717 --> 21:12.240
He was up on the reviewing stand. The MSC was under 
construction at that time and he had his entourage

21:12.710 --> 21:31.216
of horse holders and of course all of the system 
officials and school officials were up there. We

21:32.257 --> 21:41.350
common peons didn't get to didn't get to greeting 
very much, but he made an address to the entire

21:43.000 --> 21:48.308
student body later on after he spoke at the final 
review. Then he met with us all in Kyle Field. And

21:53.636 --> 21:55.458
that was quite an event. Did he say any special 
things about Aggies? He paid very great homage to

22:00.986 --> 22:12.383
Texas A&M traditions, Aggies that he had run into 
in the service. and I don't recall that he singled

22:13.308 --> 22:16.531
any out by name. I'm sure he must have mentioned 
Earl Rudder, but I don't recall it. All right, then

22:23.097 --> 22:25.639
commencement.

22:29.142 --> 22:32.105
Commencement, we had a commencement speaker. 
Don't remember who he was. Don't remember what he

22:36.849 --> 22:38.070
said. It was held out there in... Kyle Field. 
Gerald,

22:45.836 --> 22:56.773
Gerald Natardis was our valedictorian and he gave 
the valedictorian address. One of the most

22:58.255 --> 23:08.391
inspiring talks I ever heard and it was printed in 
the I believe it was printed in the yearbook. If

23:14.614 --> 23:20.139
it's not in the yearbook, I know we all got a copy of 
it. And it was very inspiring. And we walked across

23:21.660 --> 23:24.723
the stage. We had already...

23:25.704 --> 23:34.651
No, we had not yet gotten our commissions.

23:37.274 --> 23:40.116
And we got our commissions the following day. 
commencement was on the 30th, final review was on

23:41.750 --> 23:49.558
the 30th, and we got our commissions on the 31st of 
May in Guyon Hall. And... Every hand, every name

23:51.319 --> 23:57.025
was called and every hand was shaken. It was. And 
here is a picture of newly commissioned Second

23:59.287 --> 24:10.778
Lieutenant Paul Lemming on the steps of Guyon Hall 
with his mother on his left and his wife on his

23:59.287 --> 24:10.778
right. I had been a second lieutenant for ten 
minutes. And each lady had on a hat? All ladies wore

24:19.692 --> 24:22.295
hats and gloves in those days. And look how thin 
that young hurdler was in those days. Well, if you

24:27.100 --> 24:31.344
ran as much as I did, you'd be thin. What did you 
probably weigh then? When I graduated, I gained

24:33.326 --> 24:39.112
four pounds from my freshman year to my senior 
year. I weighed 176. Which in those days was pretty

24:42.415 --> 24:44.197
big.

24:46.939 --> 24:47.900
Yeah, I guess so. Never thought about it. As you are 
getting ready then to leave this campus and go into

24:52.344 --> 25:00.772
the real world, how well prepared did you think A&M 
had made you?

25:05.797 --> 25:11.562
I didn't think that there was any problem that I 
could not tackle.

25:11.930 --> 25:16.676
work it out, either by myself or with somebody 
else's cooperation. And the problem-solving

25:18.718 --> 25:36.219
skills, although we didn't call it that then, but 
the cooperation and teamwork and leadership that

25:18.718 --> 25:36.219
we had had passed down to us,

25:18.718 --> 25:36.219
it was something else. Now, how many B's had you 
made semester grades? Do you remember?

25:45.494 --> 25:46.495
Six or seven. And nothing below a B. No. What 
creates Aggie spirit? Why are Aggies so proud?

25:59.910 --> 26:09.040
Like the saying goes, from the inside, you

25:59.910 --> 26:09.040
can't explain it. From the outside, you can't 
understand it. Are there some events that help to

26:11.863 --> 26:14.826
create that contribute to that? No, it's the sum 
total of the Aggie experience, at least as far as

26:19.417 --> 26:24.623
I'm concerned. But in that Aggie experience, are 
there some special,

26:24.643 --> 26:35.035
like Yale practice and muster and silver taps and 
bonfire and commencement? All of those things.

26:37.277 --> 26:44.205
And I'm sure that all the folks you've interviewed 
had probably as difficult a time as I did defining

26:46.733 --> 26:52.161
it, let alone explaining it. But it's the sum total 
of the four year experience that you had while you

26:52.181 --> 26:58.531
were here. If you were hired today as a consultant 
to the decision makers at A&M as to what they should

27:00.213 --> 27:15.897
do in the future,

27:00.213 --> 27:15.897
what to change or not to change, to add or not to take 
away, what advice would you give them?

27:26.862 --> 27:42.525
That's a difficult question to answer because of 
the environment in which we as a university find

27:26.862 --> 27:42.525
ourselves these days and the

27:46.049 --> 27:46.550
have. I

27:47.792 --> 27:58.608
would find it very hard to deal with some of the 
students or the student situations.

28:03.595 --> 28:06.860
I would say continue on with 2020. I think we've got 
a good blueprint.

28:14.770 --> 28:21.280
I have a few minor disagreements with some of them, 
not enough to make any difference. What about

28:21.300 --> 28:24.244
size, enrollment numbers?

28:27.709 --> 28:32.236
I think if we get much larger than we are right now, 
we'd be too unwieldy. I agree with you. How do you

28:33.998 --> 28:41.189
select, then, the... That was the next problem 
that I was going to address. I don't know how.

28:44.032 --> 28:46.656
without studying the situation further. And I 
regret very much that we have to deny certain

28:47.597 --> 29:04.382
students who, in my day, would have been well 
qualified to attend,

28:47.597 --> 29:04.382
had they had the money to enroll. I don't know how 
you go about making the cutoff point,

29:15.048 --> 29:39.574
It becomes so unfair to those who don't make it who, 
because of some quirk of either demographics or

29:15.048 --> 29:39.574
maybe they're not the token minority in their high 
school, or because of Hopwood, they're denied

29:15.048 --> 29:39.574
admission.

29:39.594 --> 29:42.237
And this thing can be self-consuming and 
self-defeating. But I don't have an answer. If you

29:45.773 --> 30:00.650
could make a major gift to A&M, somebody walks up to 
you and hands you a check for a million dollars or

29:45.773 --> 30:00.650
more, and there's only one condition, you must 
pass it on to A&M, but you can determine what use

29:45.773 --> 30:00.650
will be made of that major gift. What would you want 
that gift to do?

30:08.719 --> 30:10.080
What would be your favorite act? A&M thing to 
support? I would use it to establish a law school.

30:22.622 --> 30:25.467
Located geographically where? We've got plenty 
of room on this campus. Oh, you'd put it in college

30:29.492 --> 30:30.734
session. Between here and the Brazos River, we 
have plenty of room. Now, having said that,

30:41.667 --> 30:51.556
perhaps College Station, which is not exactly the 
cultural center of the universe, might not be the

30:41.667 --> 30:51.556
best location for it. From a demographics point of 
view and from

30:53.978 --> 31:11.033
a research point of view, research as far as legal 
research is concerned. Of course, we could fill

31:11.418 --> 31:16.076
that up over time if we ever got a law school. But at 
least I would want to start it here.
