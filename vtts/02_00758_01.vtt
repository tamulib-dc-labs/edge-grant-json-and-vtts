00:08.840 --> 00:14.767
Can you tell me about your early life, where and 
when you were born, your family, that sort of

00:08.840 --> 00:14.767
thing? I was born April 28, 1916, in Sutton County, 
Texas. Sonora is a county seat. My parents lived on

00:25.040 --> 00:26.762
a ranch. And so my early years were spent there. 
What was your ranch's name? What? What was the

00:34.652 --> 00:35.793
ranch's name? The ranch? Well, my father was W.W. 
Williamson, and we didn't have a name for the

00:37.392 --> 00:42.218
ranch. But he ranched there for about 35 years. Do 
you have any brothers and sisters? Yes. I have one

00:49.847 --> 00:52.029
sister and three brothers.

00:55.093 --> 00:59.098
Can you tell me about your education and the jobs 
you've held?

01:02.722 --> 01:06.927
Actually, I started the school in Sonora. And at 
that time, I guess the age to start was six years

01:07.902 --> 01:14.197
old. But we were the closest house to the school. My 
mother became a great friend of the first grade

01:18.588 --> 01:21.355
teacher. And I was the only one at home. So the 
teacher would tell my mother what she was doing

01:25.264 --> 01:32.714
with the class at school and let her have the books 
and all. So my mother had been a teacher, so she

01:32.774 --> 01:35.557
taught me. So that's how I got such an early start at 
age five. And when I was six at the end of April, she

01:39.102 --> 01:46.271
told my mother to let me come on to school that I was 
six then. So I really was in school. less than a

01:50.073 --> 01:52.055
year, but she promoted me. And so, my mother talked 
with the superintendent to see if I should start

01:53.236 --> 02:05.409
back through the first grade, but he said it wasn't 
important that I could handle the work, so I just

01:53.236 --> 02:05.409
went on from there. So that made me graduate early, 
and graduate early from college. I've been 16 less

02:12.095 --> 02:18.662
than a month, and I graduated from high school. 20 
less a month when I graduated from college. And

02:25.324 --> 02:27.726
I've been about it during high school. I don't 
know.

02:42.580 --> 02:48.565
We moved from the ranch in Sutton County in, I 
guess, 1928.

02:51.582 --> 03:16.408
and uh my mother yeah my mother had um maintained 
two homes while we were in school in sonora i

02:51.582 --> 03:16.408
finished the seventh grade there and uh she 
decided that she was just not gonna do that anymore

02:51.582 --> 03:16.408
she never learned to drive so she couldn't drive in 
this school so uh who moves the ranch in our county.

03:19.525 --> 03:22.728
I was in eighth grade when I was 12. And there's a big 
question about how was I going to get to school,

03:22.748 --> 03:27.853
because there weren't any school buses yet. So I 
said, well, I'd love to ride a horse, so I'll just

03:27.873 --> 03:31.437
ride. My dad said, well, I want you to understand, 
if you say you're going to ride, you're going to

03:31.557 --> 03:36.862
ride rain or shine. And he meant it. And they got me 
this rain slipper that buckled around each leg.

03:44.369 --> 03:46.952
And I rode seven miles to school. seven miles back, 
14 mile run trip. Quite an experience. Kind of lost

03:51.211 --> 03:54.195
my love of horseback riding. How long did it take? 
As I remember, it was about 30 minutes. But my

04:00.183 --> 04:05.310
mother was always afraid I was going to kill the 
horse because I ran it all the way both ways.

04:08.575 --> 04:11.559
And it was quite an experience if it was cold and 
icy. Winters were colder back then. And Anyway, I

04:16.514 --> 04:17.655
survived. Don't think I was even sick that year. 
Did he ever, like, throw you or give you trouble?

04:24.102 --> 04:28.747
The first day I rode to school, he'd never been 
around that many people. I don't know, it's not

04:29.047 --> 04:32.031
read straight up, but I stayed on. And his worst 
habit was, I guess his worst, when there was a

04:33.212 --> 04:38.778
thunderstorm. Of course, I had to hitch him to a 
tree, and he whined around the tree. pull his head

04:43.615 --> 04:46.059
back and break the bridle and take off. So I used to 
have to hunt him all the time after a storm. And he

04:52.007 --> 04:56.414
had a bad habit of, he got excited, he'd run away 
with me. But anyway, as I say, I survived it and that

04:57.495 --> 05:03.604
was the only year that I had the right. Next year, my 
sister taught that school because she graduated

05:04.125 --> 05:08.712
from college and The fellow she was to marry had one 
more year in Texas. And so she taught that school

05:14.693 --> 05:19.578
and of course she drove us. You don't know about the 
next year when I was 14.

05:26.526 --> 05:30.590
My parents bought me a little green Ford Sport 
Roadster with a rumble seat. And I drove 23 miles

05:31.811 --> 05:35.155
into school in Menard. over dirt roads, which 
meant if it rained I'd get stuck sometimes. And

05:41.921 --> 05:48.670
they tell me that I drove a little speedy because I 
wanted to get there to play tennis before school

05:41.921 --> 05:48.670
started. And I played late in the afternoon after 
school was out. My mother always insisted I get

05:52.675 --> 05:54.898
home by dark. So that was my junior year. What else 
do we need to know? Do you have any curfews? Any

06:03.834 --> 06:04.255
what? Curfews. Besides, you know, being home by 
dark. Oh. Well. It kind of drove my mother crazy

06:10.121 --> 06:18.110
because there was always some event I needed to be 
there for in the evenings. And so she finally

06:19.431 --> 06:25.718
decided that my senior year she would let us have an 
apartment in this little town. So I wouldn't be on

06:26.960 --> 06:29.222
the road at all times if not.

06:33.168 --> 06:40.079
Then

06:33.168 --> 06:40.079
you went on to the University of Texas? Yeah. You 
know, this is just a small school. I think there

06:46.670 --> 06:48.493
were 36 in my class. And you were valedictorian? I 
was valedictorian. My mother had been a teacher,

06:54.906 --> 06:59.911
and it just sort of ran in the family of my oldest 
sister. My oldest sister, actually. She was

07:03.154 --> 07:04.095
valedictorian. And then my next brother was 
salutatorian. My mother was very disappointed in

07:07.639 --> 07:09.220
him. The next brother was valedictorian. He 
graduated the day he was 16. And unfortunately, he

07:16.087 --> 07:19.731
died one week before he was to go to college. He was 
around four years older than I. That's something

07:22.223 --> 07:35.359
that nobody would die of now, because he'd been 
hurt going to help a neighbor fight a

07:22.223 --> 07:35.359
fire. And then you went on to college when you were 
16? Yeah, but see, we didn't have any counselors or

07:37.362 --> 07:42.188
anything. This is a very small school. Anyway, I 
guess I should have, my husband would have said I

07:44.633 --> 07:50.141
should have majored in home ed because I didn't 
have a lot of those skills. But instead of that, I

07:51.023 --> 07:53.747
picked something less practical. Anyway, so I go 
to the University of Texas. Freshman, 16 years

07:59.415 --> 08:01.118
old. Stayed in Little Field on. And the 
interesting thing about that that I learned many,

08:04.723 --> 08:09.831
many years later George Littlefield was one of the 
biggest benefactors of the University of Texas.

08:15.328 --> 08:17.329
Of course, I didn't just live in Littlefield Dorm. 
It didn't mean much to me. Walked past Littlefield

08:18.731 --> 08:21.754
Home on the way to campus.

08:24.556 --> 08:28.560
The statues that are on the campus there were put 
there with Littlefield money. The big fountain

08:29.180 --> 08:32.744
with the bronze horses. It's Littlefield 
Fountain. Found out many years later that at one

08:35.426 --> 08:39.430
time, he owned a ranch that I grew up on. uh, in an 
abstract which I didn't realize that had a copy of

08:41.047 --> 08:53.355
George Littlefield's will in one of the abstracts 
of the rank. But anyway, uh, What do you know about

08:56.453 --> 08:58.496
school women? So you went to UT in 1938? No, I went 
there in 1932. Were there a lot of women there

09:04.083 --> 09:08.449
during that time? Oh, there wasn't any total 
enrollment. As I remember it, it was about 6,500

09:12.595 --> 09:19.384
when I went there. And when I graduated, I think 
there were about 2,000 more. So, like A&M, you

09:23.981 --> 09:31.754
know, it had just grown beyond everybody's 
expectations. And I think it's quite different

09:32.916 --> 09:35.901
than what it is now. If we had a date or anything, we 
had to sign out and had to sign in. We had strict

09:41.330 --> 09:43.453
hours and Anyway, at the end of that freshman year, 
I was elected back on the upper class council. They

09:49.445 --> 09:59.545
were elected back about 12 girls, two, sort of like 
the RAs now, I suppose, the bachelors, the

09:49.445 --> 09:59.545
freshmen. And

09:59.706 --> 10:05.357
I stayed there that year. I was president of Dawn. I 
don't know why, but somebody stuck me with that.

10:13.261 --> 10:19.089
And then I was elected back again, so I stayed in the 
freshman girls' dorm for three years. And then my

10:19.650 --> 10:24.297
last year, my senior year, I stayed in Charlotte. 
And you graduated in 1936? I graduated in 36. You

10:27.361 --> 10:28.122
were a 20? I've been 20 less than a month. So, you 
know, it was not to my advantage to graduate that

10:31.268 --> 10:42.768
young because it was kind of hard to get a job 
teaching, which I did one whole year. Um, you said,

10:45.093 --> 10:50.262
we're going to get to teaching in a minute. I had 
various activities, I don't know what all, but I

10:51.035 --> 10:56.180
served on student government two years. It was 
called Student Assembly over there. From the

10:59.843 --> 11:03.086
College of Education, or School of Education, 
whichever it was. You said your husband said you

11:04.647 --> 11:07.110
should have taken homemaking. Why do you say that? 
Oh, yes, yes. Why do you say that? Because I

11:12.214 --> 11:13.756
couldn't cook. And he was from a family of boys, and 
his mother had been a real good cook. And... We're

11:21.680 --> 11:23.122
getting ahead of ourselves. Actually, I don't 
remember ever being introduced to Earl Rudder. My

11:30.870 --> 11:39.739
older brother, so there's six years difference in 
our ages, and my older brother had been at Tarleton

11:30.870 --> 11:39.739
when Earl was. And I sort of had my eye on him from 
looking at the angles. It was strange. In fact, I

11:47.009 --> 11:51.904
was no more than maybe 11 years old when I took note 
of him. And he was a big football player, the

11:52.486 --> 11:57.762
captain and all that. This little town, Minari. 
And see, I lived 23 miles from there. But they had a

12:05.321 --> 12:08.866
hotel that had the whole top floor was ballroom. It 
had the best dances. And that's where I first met

12:12.291 --> 12:14.434
her. We started dancing together. I was my 
brother's sister. I knew who he was. And right

12:22.865 --> 12:26.711
after college, you taught for one year? I got the 
job. He came down. my senior year, earlier. We'd

12:30.947 --> 12:33.734
been dating for a couple years already. Only when 
he was, when I was home from school. And so he came

12:37.323 --> 12:41.494
down and said I would apply in Brady. All my friends 
went to Houston to preach, but I got the job in

12:41.514 --> 12:46.767
Brady. And I taught one year, and that was 
depression. And they had a rule that they wouldn't

12:50.295 --> 12:56.123
hire a married teacher. Of course, I made the 
fantastic sum of $900 for the entire year. $100 a

13:01.510 --> 13:05.236
month, and you taught nine months, and that's all 
you got paid. And I was so young, and I guess full of

13:06.457 --> 13:13.487
pep, that I was sponsored for everything they had. 
I was sponsored by the ball club, and I never... I

13:15.873 --> 13:17.276
played a game. That was before school, 7.30 in the 
morning. And then I sponsored the cap squad after

13:19.461 --> 13:21.586
school. And then I sponsored senior class. So it 
was kind of a busy year. And anyway, We waited until

13:31.398 --> 13:36.946
I was re-elected for another year before letting 
the board know that we planned to get married. And

13:38.469 --> 13:43.857
Earl told them that I would be glad to teach if they 
saw fit to change the rules. But they didn't change

13:44.258 --> 13:45.219
it. They just let me be the chief substitute. And it 
wouldn't matter a whole lot because we were just

13:48.384 --> 13:52.410
there one more year. And then he was made football 
coach. See he was a football coach when I married

13:55.755 --> 13:57.277
him. He was made football coach at Tarleton. So 
that was 1938. So we go to Tarleton and as I told him

14:04.448 --> 14:14.263
last fall when he was named Distinguished Alumnus 
up there, the first one they had named

14:04.448 --> 14:14.263
posthumously. in my remarks i told him that he was 
doubly glad to get that job because in the first

14:14.817 --> 14:39.964
place he made 30 a month more than he'd made 
coaching in high school and the next reason was he

14:14.817 --> 14:39.964
could put me in back in school and have cook which he 
did did he really oh yeah of course he thought i was

14:14.817 --> 14:39.964
sorry strange because i had grown up on a ranch and 
did not have a milk with cow dress of chicken But

14:40.366 --> 14:43.069
cooking, he just couldn't forgive that. And I 
think the last straw was when he told me once that he

14:43.650 --> 14:51.941
thought because I'd grown up on the ranch that I 
surely know how to cook a pot of red beans. So he told

14:51.961 --> 14:56.046
me that day, he said, I'm so hungry for a good pot of 
red beans. And I thought, OK. So I went to the

14:57.528 --> 15:01.152
grocery store and bought five pounds, came home, 
and put them all on the cook. And they just had to do

15:01.813 --> 15:03.455
everything in my kitchen. So with that, he decided 
he better let me have some fame in hometown. So I

15:09.526 --> 15:12.151
guess it's helped a lot. Where'd you get your 
training at? That was at Tarleton's. He was

15:14.816 --> 15:16.158
football coach there. So he just put me in school.

15:20.246 --> 15:21.288
And he was from Brady? He was born in Brady? No, he 
was born in Eden, which is... very small it's a one

15:26.603 --> 15:55.294
traffic light crown to this day and that's where he 
was born there are two pictures in the high school

15:26.603 --> 15:55.294
in eden one is a general ira acre he was head of the uh 
all our air forces in european theater and in

15:26.603 --> 15:55.294
earl's picture so i guess they're still there i 
haven't been there in a long time but the last time i

15:26.603 --> 15:55.294
was there anyone said that he helped pay his way to 
charlton by milking a cow he he paid his entire

15:55.662 --> 16:22.564
education except for five dollars his mother gave 
him seeing his dad really didn't want him to go to

15:55.662 --> 16:22.564
college because he said see earl had made his own 
money from the time he was seven years old and doing

15:55.662 --> 16:22.564
one thing another selling door-to-door very soon 
and then the time he was going in high school, he was

16:22.882 --> 16:25.004
working in a drug store. And his dad said, I think 
it'd be foolish for you to go to college because

16:26.305 --> 16:37.095
you're making more money now than I was when I 
married your mother. But the coach, the football

16:37.115 --> 16:41.799
coach at Carlton had been through this a little 
time. And his doctor had lunch at a little cafe

16:42.640 --> 16:45.002
there. And he said to the owner, he said, do you have 
any good football players around here? He said,

16:50.828 --> 16:52.129
well, we got one. He said, it's rubber. So he looked 
him up. It didn't take him long to find him. The town

16:57.140 --> 16:58.103
was so tiny. And so I have this and a letter that this 
coach wrote to me three years after my husband's

16:59.667 --> 17:08.008
death. But he told Earl, he said, if you'll come and 
play football, he said, we'll find a way for you to

17:08.512 --> 17:16.262
get through school. Of course, they didn't make, 
they didn't give them anything, you know, for

17:16.282 --> 17:21.489
playing. I said, well, they didn't have the free 
use of the uniform. That was just about it.

17:29.099 --> 17:32.704
He got a job waiting tables in the college dining 
room. And he's still running kind of short of

17:34.126 --> 17:36.089
money. And so he got a job at a drug store that was 
just across the campus. So he was working those two

17:43.499 --> 17:44.921
jobs. And at the end of his first year, he was 
elected captain for the following year. And so the

17:51.731 --> 17:54.955
next fall, he started out with his two jobs. He was 
still having just a rough time. He just didn't

17:57.276 --> 18:01.060
think he could get by on what he was making. So he 
went to see a coach one day right at lunchtime to

18:02.101 --> 18:11.051
tell him that he was going to have to go home, but he 
just couldn't make it. Coach said, oh, Rudder

18:11.071 --> 18:18.139
said, just go on, and I'm getting ready to go to 
Lions Club, and you have to come back after lunch,

18:11.071 --> 18:18.139
and I'll talk to you. So when he got to Lions Club, he 
told the membership, he said, look, we've got to

18:18.159 --> 18:24.486
figure out some way to keep him in school. He said, 
I'm about to lose my captain. And so you just see

18:28.622 --> 18:31.524
what we can do to help him. So they decided to buy a 
Jersey milk cow. And they let him graze it around

18:35.208 --> 18:42.175
the football field and milk it and sell the milk to 
the dining hall. And they still laugh up there and

18:42.195 --> 18:51.564
say that the first day he took his bucket to the 
dining hall to sell it, it wasn't quite full. So

18:52.045 --> 18:54.507
they didn't pay him what he thought he was going to 
get. So the next day when he dealt the cow, he was on

18:55.516 --> 19:00.304
the way to the dining hall with the milk. Just 
happened to notice there was a water faucet. He

19:02.908 --> 19:05.151
said from then on he always drived full bucket. I 
guess that's true. That's a

19:08.757 --> 19:13.584
good story. Okay. So you met General Rutter when he 
was a junior in college? No, you were a junior in

19:18.392 --> 19:20.275
college and he was already a coach? No, I was a 
freshman in college, and he was coaching today.

19:29.384 --> 19:33.893
But his first year out of A&M, times were so tough 
then. And he did all kinds of things to get through

19:35.206 --> 19:37.328
A&M. See, he came down here for his last two years. 
Graduated here in 1932. But he couldn't get a job

19:43.173 --> 19:48.698
except for one with a highway department. They 
were building a road between Eden and Menard. And

19:52.181 --> 19:59.088
he was, his first year out of A&M with his degree, he 
took a job digging ditches for 25 cents an hour. And

20:00.249 --> 20:03.812
then the next fall, he got the job coaching the 
baby. When did we get married? We got married in

20:08.039 --> 20:10.122
1937, see? I had finished Texas in 36, taught that 
one year in Brady. And then we married in 1936. And

20:20.297 --> 20:30.010
in 1941, he got off into the war, 1940? Yeah. We had 
our first child. in Stephenville, in 40. And when

20:35.858 --> 20:43.428
he was just about a year old, maybe a month or two 
after he was a year old, he was called into the

20:35.858 --> 20:43.428
service. Because, see, he got his reserve 
permission when he graduated from A&M. And he was

20:48.595 --> 20:53.622
first sent to Fort St. Houston. And from there to 
infantry school in Fort Benning and then back to

20:53.763 --> 20:59.871
Fort St. Houston. Then to the 83rd Division up in 
Camp Atterbury, Indiana. By then we had a second

21:05.120 --> 21:07.143
child, that was 1942. Were you following him 
along? Oh yeah, until he went overseas.

21:15.053 --> 21:18.498
So anyway, we lived in all kinds of places. People 
would not believe, it would just sound like a crazy

21:18.598 --> 21:26.789
story if I mentioned how we had lived in some of 
those places. But you did what you had to do. And so

21:29.264 --> 21:36.077
he went overseas in November of 1943.

21:38.201 --> 21:46.456
And so when he went overseas, I had to bring the two 
children and come back home. And so we came back to

21:46.476 --> 21:51.846
stay in Brady because his brother and his And back 
in 35, he was responsible for putting in a

21:52.214 --> 22:00.105
drugstore in Brady, which he and his brother all 
played together. And then my parents would be just

22:00.125 --> 22:04.871
36 miles from me. They could be a lot of help and 
worry. So we stayed there during the war. And you

22:15.966 --> 22:16.707
had two children? I had two children. We were in two 
years apart. Well, the first one was a son named

22:22.167 --> 22:29.336
James Earl Rudder, Jr., but they always called him 
Bud. The next one was Anne, the

22:30.517 --> 22:36.465
daughter. So during the war, you and the children 
went back home? Stayed in David, uh-huh. Until he

22:41.191 --> 22:45.296
came

22:41.191 --> 22:45.296
home? Yeah. What about his actions during the war? 
Can you tell me about those? Actually, when he was

22:51.513 --> 23:01.068
in the 83rd Division at Camp Atterbury in Indiana, 
the War Department decided that all divisions

22:51.513 --> 23:01.068
should put in some ranger training. So they put him 
in charge of that. And General Friedendahl went

23:04.233 --> 23:09.842
around the country looking at all the divisions 
and inspecting a program for ranger training, and

23:10.700 --> 23:15.227
he decided that that was the best. And so he named 
Earl to command the second ranger battalion, the

23:16.448 --> 23:23.779
first had been formed, commanded by General 
Darby. And he did not come back from war. He was

23:28.506 --> 23:30.950
killed late in the war. And Earl commanded the 
second ranger battalion, Camp Forest,

23:31.010 --> 23:39.222
Tennessee, trained there, and then took them 
overseas. And they trained in England,

23:39.742 --> 23:45.189
in Cornwall. They had cliffs there. When he found 
out what their mission was, it was really a tough

23:47.492 --> 23:53.820
one. And so they trained in Cornwall, and they 
trained some on the Isle of Wight. And their

24:01.850 --> 24:03.893
mission was to... climb these 100-foot cliffs in 
Normandy, Pointe du Hoc, and knock out the six

24:04.936 --> 24:20.673
155-millimeter guns that the Germans had placed 
there that could fire on Utah and Omaha beaches.

24:21.314 --> 24:23.016
When the soldiers came across. What? When the 
soldiers came across the beaches. Oh, yeah, when

24:25.939 --> 24:28.202
they landed. They were to knock out these guns so 
the soldiers could land on those two beaches.

24:33.218 --> 24:37.065
because his point jutted out right between the two 
beaches. And everybody thought it was sort of a

24:37.085 --> 24:42.735
suicide mission, that there's no way to take a dip. 
And General Bradley, in his book, A Soldier's

24:43.437 --> 24:52.133
Story, describes it as the most difficult 
assignment he ever gave a soldier in his entire

24:43.437 --> 24:52.133
career. And so, for the D-Day mission, Earl was 
given command of not only the 2nd, but the 5th

24:57.299 --> 25:01.767
battalion. He could command both of them for the 
invasion. And so there were only three companies

25:06.335 --> 25:21.602
out of the 2nd that went up the cliffs, D, E, and F. 
And the other companies, A and B, they landed on

25:06.335 --> 25:21.602
other parts of the invasion beaches. And he 
handpicked 225 men for this mission. And at the end

25:28.283 --> 25:32.638
of the first day, there were only 90 able to bear 
arms.

25:43.790 --> 25:47.936
The way this mission was planned, timing was 
everything. The battleship in the Channel,

25:50.219 --> 25:53.183
Battleship St. Channels, were lobbing shells 
over onto the Pointe du Hôte. And at this point in

26:00.212 --> 26:07.622
time, they would stop shelling because at that 
time, the range was supposed to be at the foot of the

26:00.212 --> 26:07.622
cliff. But as it happened, when they were loaded 
off the ships that brought them across the channel

26:11.768 --> 26:15.955
into their small landing craft. They were 
assigned a British guide boat. And this British

26:20.623 --> 26:23.368
guide boat took them off course. There was another 
point that looked very similar, but it was about

26:23.388 --> 26:29.999
four miles to the east, at least four miles, maybe 
further. And so it didn't take long for my husband

26:31.101 --> 26:37.472
to realize that they were headed for the wrong 
point. And he kept trying to tell this British

26:38.144 --> 26:43.632
guide boat that they were headed for the wrong 
point, but they ignored it. And finally, he had

26:45.114 --> 27:04.422
just take command of his own little bunch of 
landing craft and turn them to the west toward the

26:45.114 --> 27:04.422
proper point, which meant, see, if they had gone in 
on time, the Germans would have been driven

26:45.114 --> 27:04.422
underground because they had a vast, array of 
underground tunnels. They couldn't stay up on the

27:08.918 --> 27:11.502
top with all the shelling. So if they could have 
been there at the proper time, the Germans would

27:12.865 --> 27:16.892
have been totally surprised. But at the time that 
they were supposed to be there, the shelling quit.

27:22.627 --> 27:26.672
And yet they were far from being there, and the seas 
were very rough. I think the waves were at least six

27:26.812 --> 27:28.895
feet high. And so they had to come along parallel to 
the coastline. And the Germans by then had had

27:35.703 --> 27:43.032
time, they were about 40 minutes late, had had time 
to come out of the underground And so they were on

27:43.012 --> 27:48.541
top of the cliff waiting for them. They were firing 
at them, and they were cutting the ropes that they

27:49.141 --> 27:52.407
were climbing up. See, the way they would get up 
those cliffs, they had grappling hooks attached

27:53.048 --> 28:06.268
to ropes that they would fire by rocket off their 
little landing craft. dig into the soil. I'm not

28:09.392 --> 28:10.414
saying it's very good. And then they'd find these 
ropes, and then they had some rope ladders that

28:12.256 --> 28:16.342
they had. And they also had some, my husband had 
borrowed some ladders from the fire department in

28:17.143 --> 28:26.817
London, and they were in sections. They put those 
together and put up on the face of the cliff. But

28:30.783 --> 28:34.348
anyway, as I say, it was unfortunate that the It 
couldn't have gone off on time, but it was not the

28:34.750 --> 28:39.485
fault of the rangers, it was the fault of the 
Buddhist guide boat. But anyway, they were up

28:41.270 --> 28:48.372
there then, and it denied them their 
reinforcements that they were to have had. If they

28:49.904 --> 29:04.083
didn't get the signal that they were up on the 
cliffs by a certain time, then the rest of the

28:49.904 --> 29:04.083
second and fifth battalions would land on Omaha 
Beach, which they did. And then they'd have to

29:05.064 --> 29:12.013
fight over land to get to the ranges where it 
pointed to Hope. So it was not until two and a half

29:12.770 --> 29:19.007
days later that the reinforcements got to them. By 
then they had run out of ammunition, they'd run out

29:19.468 --> 29:26.506
of food, and they'd had several German 
counterattacks. Of course they were really

29:30.286 --> 29:31.228
outnumbered. And the things looked pretty bleak 
there for a while. Of course, on that day my husband

29:37.660 --> 29:44.533
was shot through the leg, but fortunately it 
didn't hit the bone. And when he established his

29:46.176 --> 29:53.290
command post, he was inside of this open sort of a 
German bunker. And there were two men, one on

29:53.827 --> 30:11.818
either side of him, and a shell came in from, I 
guess, one of the ships out in the channel, hit the

29:53.827 --> 30:11.818
side of this rock bunker, and it killed the men on 
either side of him, and he was... left in the middle

30:13.115 --> 30:40.236
he got shrapnel in his arm and his leg and his hip 
actually that day so they considered he was

30:13.115 --> 30:40.236
wounded three times but he never left command of 
the of the rangers they had one doctor who actually

30:13.115 --> 30:40.236
in civilian life was a pediatrician but he kind of 
patched him up put bandage on and he kept going so

30:13.115 --> 30:40.236
anyway i think uh that of all the challenges that he 
faced throughout his life, that was probably the

30:41.785 --> 30:49.095
worst. And I think since he lived through that, I 
kind of think the challenges that came up later, he

30:50.177 --> 31:03.716
always could do because of having had that 
experience. Do you think that the Lord changed

31:03.736 --> 31:05.018
him? Oh, I do. In fact, he said that war was such a 
terrible thing. And that wasn't the end of it. He

31:14.816 --> 31:19.268
was given command of the 109th Regiment in the 28th 
Division. on the 8th of December, I believe it was,

31:20.598 --> 31:36.740
and on the 16th then, the Germans' last great 
offensive was out of the bush, and it hit right

31:20.598 --> 31:36.740
where his division was. His regiment held the 
southern flank, and parts of the division were

31:37.361 --> 31:45.171
just absolutely all but wiped out. So that was 
another tough experience for him. So there's no

31:49.228 --> 31:52.210
doubt that the war changed him more than anything. 
And so when he came home, he felt so thankful just to

31:53.171 --> 31:57.995
have survived it. But he said, if you didn't want it 
to happen again, you better get to work on the home

31:58.816 --> 32:04.361
front. And so he'd hardly bring it back. He got 
home. And he'd been gone two years. And of course, I

32:11.046 --> 32:15.310
was so glad to get him home. The War Department 
turned around and had him, put him in command of a

32:15.290 --> 32:23.180
Victor Loaning Train that had all sorts of war 
souvenirs. And sent him all around the country

32:24.882 --> 32:28.586
selling war bonds. So that kept him another, oh 
let's see, that was from September until two days

32:28.606 --> 32:37.237
before Christmas. So he got home. And then in April 
he was elected mayor. We were in Brady. And so he

32:44.382 --> 32:52.253
served as mayor for six years, three times. And he 
was elected to the State Democratic Executive

32:52.273 --> 32:55.898
Committee. And while on that, he got three plans 
for the governor. He was Alan Shivers at the time.

33:06.973 --> 33:09.597
And so in 1955, The land commissioner had been, he 
was serving, I think he'd been elected to his ninth

33:10.505 --> 33:17.053
term. He was head of the whole messianic 
organization in the state of Texas. Most

33:24.002 --> 33:24.443
respected person. But he saw an opportunity to 
make some money, but it was crooked. He ended up in

33:27.707 --> 33:28.368
prison. And he could tell what he was being caught 
up with. And so he just said he, for personal

33:33.454 --> 33:39.702
reasons, he wasn't going to serve that term that 
he'd been elected to. So that meant that the

33:39.884 --> 33:43.889
governor had to appoint somebody. So the governor 
appointed Earl as land commissioner. Mitch was

33:48.334 --> 33:51.918
the general land officer for this property. That 
was a big job, and things were in such a glorious

33:51.938 --> 33:55.161
mess.

33:58.125 --> 34:05.453
But he waded into that and straightened it out, ran 
for re-election, got re-elected. And in the

34:05.838 --> 34:23.217
middle of his second term, the board of directors 
that was called in at A&M came and wanted him to come

34:05.838 --> 34:23.217
here as vice president, actually, but with the 
understanding that he was to run this campus. And

34:23.957 --> 34:30.985
then the following year, he was made president of 
A&M. Of course, many, many things happened to

34:31.910 --> 34:38.038
change the face of the university during his 
administration.

34:45.367 --> 34:48.231
What were some of those things that changed 
Hayden? Well, at the beginning of the spring

34:48.251 --> 34:56.702
semester of 1958, the spring he came here, And I'd 
say he left in the middle of his term that he'd been

34:57.526 --> 35:01.817
elected to. We worked very hard to get him 
re-elected at campaign headquarters in our home

35:01.837 --> 35:07.671
in Austin. And, like I say, uh, but when the NM 
wanted to come here, that was it. Uh, at the time we

35:14.109 --> 35:18.896
got here, there were less than 7,000 students. I 
think there'd been a little more than 7,000 in the

35:18.916 --> 35:24.104
fall, the start of the fall semester. But, of 
course, it dropped off a little bit at the start of

35:24.144 --> 35:28.250
the second semester. And it was all male, all 
military. The name was Agricultural Mechanical

35:31.975 --> 35:34.519
College. And integration had not taken place. So 
during his administration, girls were admitted.

35:42.288 --> 35:43.410
That was 1963. The name change took place the same 
year. And they didn't want to give up the A&M part of

35:48.057 --> 35:53.024
the name. See, so many land grant colleges over the 
nation, they took like LSU, Louisiana State. It

36:01.477 --> 36:03.780
was a land grant college. That was a trend. But the 
former students didn't want that. They wanted

36:09.728 --> 36:11.490
that A&M . But it didn't stand for agricultural 
mechanical anymore. So they just decided to call

36:15.254 --> 36:18.657
it Texas A&M University. That was in 63. 
Integration, I'm not sure what year that took

36:21.600 --> 36:24.243
place. But it was done smooth itself. No problem. 
Of course, during the 60s, There was a lot of

36:35.249 --> 36:42.242
student unrest at other schools, but not here, not 
at A&M. That was one thing that, he had been a

36:42.602 --> 36:55.125
student, General Jim Hannigan, that he had gone to 
Washington and looked for somebody that was young

36:42.602 --> 36:55.125
enough and just retired from the Army. And the 
Prima, too, I believe, pretty well kept things

36:56.127 --> 36:59.653
under control. Although there was a group that 
came over here and tried to organize, but they had

37:00.410 --> 37:11.761
that cord so organized against it that they never 
got hold of it. How did they maintain control?

37:17.506 --> 37:20.790
Well, they just had that much discipline. It was so 
much smaller then compared to now. they came over

37:27.781 --> 37:55.392
here i guess in school where i went and tried to 
organize had their literature and all that but

37:27.781 --> 37:55.392
they didn't they didn't get the first place and 
they sent them in from oh i don't know exactly how

37:27.781 --> 37:55.392
far away but trying to organize things like that 
but they just let it be known they weren't going to

37:27.781 --> 37:55.392
stand for it the administration let it be known

37:57.717 --> 38:03.405
In 1965, he was named head of the entire system. So 
he was still president of A&M here, but head of the

38:03.425 --> 38:08.272
whole system. And he just, he never stopped. He 
just worked night and

38:11.396 --> 38:17.725
day. And I say in 19, well, in fact, January of 1970, 
he got sick. died in March, March 23rd, at the age of

38:26.978 --> 38:31.945
59. That's young. Yeah, very

38:32.807 --> 38:37.554
young. I don't know where we go from here. So, you 
were older than he was? He was six years older than I

38:45.806 --> 38:48.450
was. Oh, I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I do know. Okay, 
um... Okay, I thought your... But I never

38:53.658 --> 38:59.047
considered it. I just, you see we had five 
children, and in all these things that he did, I

39:00.249 --> 39:16.577
know when, when the governor poached him about 
being mentioned at the general I told him, I said,

39:17.671 --> 39:24.367
you do what you want to do because my work's cut out 
for me to produce the children. And he had a kind of a

39:24.447 --> 39:25.951
system anyway. He took care of his job and 
business. I took care of the house and the

39:30.783 --> 39:32.226
children. It worked out pretty well. Was he really 
active with the children or things like that?

39:38.877 --> 39:42.704
Well, he was all so busy with his job from the time 
they were seven. Our youngest was only eight

39:44.668 --> 39:50.218
months old when he was made land commissioner. So 
it pretty well fell my lot. Of course, he did, you

39:54.185 --> 39:56.048
know, what he could.

40:04.752 --> 40:10.361
Okay, you once said that Lyndon Johnson had 
offered positions to do no matter? Yeah. Can you

40:10.721 --> 40:11.643
tell me about that? Well, it goes way back. In 1948, 
when Lyndon Johnson ran for the Senate, he asked

40:17.291 --> 40:30.051
Earl, we were living in Brady, he asked Earl to be 
his campaign manager in the district, which had 16

40:17.291 --> 40:30.051
or 18 counties, I've forgotten. We lived close to 
where his opponent lived. He said, now you can't

40:34.099 --> 40:38.585
carry this county because you're too close to 
where Colt Stevenson lived. As it turned out, the

40:40.207 --> 40:47.357
county where we lived went for him by more votes 
than he won the statewide election by. He only won

40:49.019 --> 40:53.345
the election by 87 votes statewide, which is 
unheard of. That's why they call them landslide

40:54.246 --> 40:56.189
limits. And so after that, anything that Earl 
asked of him. He always came through for him. But

41:07.222 --> 41:24.945
when

41:07.222 --> 41:24.945
I'm looking at the picture of Lyndon Johnson over 
there, which reminds me of when we got it, they had

41:07.222 --> 41:24.945
asked us up to the White House in 66 to a dinner for 
Henry Cabot Lodge. and, uh, flight experience for

41:25.904 --> 41:31.831
me earlier than the floor that I had. And, uh, so the 
next morning after the... We stayed there in the

41:31.851 --> 41:40.602
White House up on the third floor, and the 
President's quarters were on the second floor.

41:41.763 --> 41:46.149
And, uh, so we hadn't really had much of a chance to 
visit personally with him. And the next morning,

41:47.510 --> 41:55.540
we were gonna leave fairly soon, and, uh, the 
President called and said to come down to the...

41:55.520 --> 42:08.376
floor below, and I don't know if I should tell this 
or not, he was still in bed in his pajamas and his

41:55.520 --> 42:08.376
hair wasn't combed, he had newspapers scattered 
all around him, and had three TV screens going. He

42:08.777 --> 42:21.713
was talking to Senator Snyder, and as we walked in, 
he said, you know, Senator, I can get nearly

42:08.777 --> 42:21.713
everybody to do what I ask them to do except Earl 
Rudder, and he won't do a blank thing. Because he

42:21.693 --> 42:27.080
had offered, I can't tell you which things he had 
offered Earl. Some in Washington and some were

42:27.461 --> 42:29.623
foreign opponents. But Earl would always say, I'm 
sorry Mr. President, but I have brought too many

42:30.505 --> 42:37.954
good people to A&M to go off and leave. Go off and 
leave. So he wouldn't leave here. And I guess it

42:41.780 --> 42:45.945
wasn't the easiest thing in the world to turn a 
president down, especially one like William

42:41.780 --> 42:45.945
Johnson. Some of the things he brought at A&M, um, 
women were allowed in. Yeah. Coral was made

42:52.590 --> 42:54.171
optional. Coral was made optional. Uh-huh. The 
name was changed, and there was a tremendous

42:55.272 --> 42:59.536
population boom. Well, uh, it boomed...

42:59.556 --> 43:05.943
more so after his death. There's all these things 
that had been keeping it from going. It was about

43:09.186 --> 43:13.990
14,000-something at the time he died, which was 
double what it was when he came here. But, uh...

43:17.195 --> 43:24.051
It's like the lady said last night at this dinner 
for retiring professors. Said he's the one that

43:24.071 --> 43:31.969
made the decision to let it go like that. And of 
course, I think that's true. What did he think

43:34.863 --> 43:38.208
about allowing women to go to A&M? Well, he was for 
it, you see. But the strange thing was, the student

43:39.711 --> 43:44.057
body, all male, was not. They wanted it just like it 
was. And especially these old eggs that were

43:46.501 --> 43:49.806
already out of A&M. Some of them never did get over 
it. They thought things had just gone to pop.

43:54.994 --> 43:58.660
Because they wanted to be just like it was when they 
were students here. But actually, the student

43:59.602 --> 44:06.851
body, when he got up before them and told them they 
were going to admit the girls, they booed him. They

44:07.712 --> 44:12.057
also burned him in effigy out in front of the house. 
Didn't they also burn the dog in effigy? No. They

44:14.460 --> 44:16.202
didn't burn the dog. They just painted the dog. 
They were always painting that funny bulldog that

44:19.066 --> 44:22.250
he named Ranger. But when the matter of admitting 
the coeds came up, This dog just waddled around all

44:29.082 --> 44:31.387
over campus. Everybody that was in school knew and 
remembered him. But they painted him with a sign

44:34.212 --> 44:37.199
that says, Maggie's Go Home. So they called the 
girls Maggie instead of Abby. And they booed them

44:43.207 --> 44:45.110
outside the house? How long did they do that? Well, 
no, it was at, I guess, G. Raleigh, they had this

44:47.213 --> 44:51.219
meeting. And so we told the student body they were 
going to put the girls in their booty. And then,

44:55.546 --> 45:02.456
see, that was before the old house burned, the one 
that had first been occupied by Lawrence Sullivan

44:55.546 --> 45:02.456
Ross. Built in 1892, and it was in January of 63 that 
it burned from a faulted chimney on one of the

45:03.137 --> 45:12.471
coldest days of the year. And, uh, anyway, uh,

45:13.767 --> 45:23.761
I forgot what I was talking about. Uh, them doing an 
effigy. Oh, burning an effigy out in front of their

45:25.243 --> 45:29.288
house. Up in a tree I looked at at, oh, early morning 
hours, and there was a fire, and I thought, what in

45:29.308 --> 45:35.557
the world? That's what it was. What did he say about 
that? Who, Earl? He didn't say much. I guess he

45:41.806 --> 45:43.588
thought it was kind of funny, I don't know. He was 
not an excitable person. I was one that was

45:46.792 --> 45:50.438
excitable. He was pretty calm. Oh, very calm. And 
about the war, I think you asked me, he didn't

45:52.240 --> 45:58.069
really talk about it. I learned more from other 
people that were in the war with him than I ever

45:58.089 --> 46:03.096
learned from him. Did he have any memories that he 
shared? No, not really. Of course, he was invited

46:07.149 --> 46:09.211
back. It was his regiment that liberated the last 
German stronghold in France, which was Comarch.

46:14.956 --> 46:18.339
It's right on the eastern border. And so right 
after he took office in Austin in 1955, the land

46:18.359 --> 46:32.591
office, General Eisenhower was present, and he 
asked him to be his representative to go to the 10th

46:18.359 --> 46:32.591
anniversary of the liberation of Comarch. So that 
was his first trip back. And then, uh, in 1954,

46:35.813 --> 46:51.289
Collier's Magazine wanted to do an article

46:35.813 --> 46:51.289
on a man that took his son back, and so they chose 
Earl. And, uh, this fellow that was the, uh,

46:52.310 --> 47:00.679
writer, he said he went to Washington to research 
it, and Earl was the ideal one. And, uh, so, That was

47:04.467 --> 47:05.433
unfictical. He went back. But he hesitated about 
going back. He wasn't sure that he really wanted to

47:09.035 --> 47:10.765
go.
