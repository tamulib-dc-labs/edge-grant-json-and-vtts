WEBVTT

00:01.533 --> 00:30.038
about the homecoming or the the reception or the 
lack of reception to receive

00:01.533 --> 00:30.038
uh no but i'm not sure that i ever expected one i had 
spent the previous 12 to 15 years going overseas

00:01.533 --> 00:30.038
and coming back home and you know it's a solitary 
thing coming in by myself going out by myself i

00:01.533 --> 00:30.038
never really expect anybody to have a band waiting 
for me Going to Vietnam was just another two-year

00:30.473 --> 00:36.259
overseas, and coming back, coming home again. I 
didn't expect a band. It wasn't all that kind of a

00:37.360 --> 00:40.743
glory thing to me. It was a job to do, a job that I had 
agreed to do as part of my career. That's the only

00:49.432 --> 00:50.313
thing I looked at. It was somewhere to go to do the 
job, and I'd come back. If I had to go again, I went

00:52.676 --> 00:54.017
again. But I don't think that I approached it with 
a... glory after the fact that some of our speakers

00:59.026 --> 01:04.734
have said they expected on their return. I don't 
know how anybody realistically could look at war

01:04.894 --> 01:11.763
as something where it was a glorious thing to get 
into. Perhaps it's because they didn't have the

01:12.925 --> 01:14.607
training. They've seen a lot of movies and films. 
That's great. You know the guy's going to get up and

01:18.052 --> 01:22.097
walk away after the film's over with. That's not a 
realistic concept of what war is. If you've been

01:25.658 --> 01:30.723
training for war most of your life, you don't have 
that concept. I never expected any big parade or

01:30.743 --> 01:34.927
anything. I never felt rejected by the society. I 
never had any real derogatory comments directed

01:37.370 --> 01:42.175
at me. One of our speakers said he was sped up on 
whatever. I just crossed the country several

01:45.578 --> 01:49.963
times, going to Vietnam, coming back to Vietnam in 
my uniform. I never had anybody say anything to me.

01:52.739 --> 02:01.410
And I think I probably mingled with the same people 
those guys did coming in and out of San Francisco

01:52.739 --> 02:01.410
and California and up there. So I don't

02:01.430 --> 02:07.798
think we were that much rejected. Nobody just paid 
any attention to us. If you're looking for a big

02:10.261 --> 02:13.745
parade, obviously you can feel rejected. It 
wasn't my idea. I wanted to get off the plane and go

02:14.526 --> 02:18.491
home. OK. I don't know if you, were you watching the 
news in 1975 when Saigon fell? And if so, or even if

02:23.682 --> 02:28.852
not, how did you, did you feel really like you just 
wasted your time there? How'd that make you feel?

02:31.979 --> 02:32.741
Oh, I watched it.

02:36.629 --> 02:37.731
The only thing that I could say about it. Well, it 
happened. I knew it probably would. I didn't have

02:43.697 --> 02:53.510
any real doubts that they could hold out if we 
decided to pull out when Nixon started talking an

02:43.697 --> 02:53.510
honorable piece and get us out and get me settled 
among themselves. It was pretty much a foregone

02:54.432 --> 03:06.688
conclusion among most of us that had been there 
that if they got out peaceably, that it wouldn't

02:54.432 --> 03:06.688
last six months. Within six months, they'd either 
be swamped or they'd be going to war again. So we

03:11.161 --> 03:20.910
didn't see anything really different from what we 
had suspected once we decided we were going to get

03:11.161 --> 03:20.910
out of there. I personally couldn't see how the 
Vietnamese could stand up to them if they hadn't

03:20.970 --> 03:25.995
been able to do it all that time. With us there, they 
certainly wouldn't be able to do it with us out

03:27.196 --> 03:31.960
there. It was just a matter of he came sooner or not. 
I thought he would. I didn't feel any evil. Regrets

03:38.309 --> 03:39.390
about it. I certainly didn't feel that we'd spend 
our time here for nothing.

03:45.058 --> 03:47.742
We did what we set out to do during the time that we 
were there. If that was our goal, then we

03:49.424 --> 03:51.848
accomplished our goal. But it didn't make me feel 
like we had been defeated by any means or that we'd

03:54.471 --> 04:02.362
been betrayed or anything else. It was simply the 
outcome. It was a logical outcome the way we were

04:03.964 --> 04:06.848
headed. You want to get emotionally tied up into 
it, and you probably could feel that you were kind

04:07.942 --> 04:17.144
of betrayed for the time you spent over there, but I 
don't know. I never looked at it as an emotional

04:17.205 --> 04:19.229
thing. I knew there was another job to do. I went to 
do the job. I came home, but I had to go back and do the

04:22.197 --> 04:24.803
job again. Never any real emotion tied up for that 
place. I could have cared less one way or the other

04:28.782 --> 04:30.945
which way it went. But when I was told to go there and 
do a job, I went there and did the job. That's the

04:35.831 --> 04:37.674
only way I would have cared. I would say that in 
personal encounter with the Vietnamese, I knew

04:40.437 --> 04:51.491
after my first tour there that we were fighting 
sort of a losing battle. The Vietnamese

04:51.751 --> 04:54.655
themselves, if they would ever talk to you, didn't 
really care whether it was BC or Arvin running the

04:56.018 --> 05:00.343
country. So long as somebody was stabilized, they 
only have to contend with one government. So here

05:07.531 --> 05:09.393
they are in the middle of everything. Put up with BC 
when they were there, and put up with Arvin when

05:09.413 --> 05:16.120
they were controlling the area, and they didn't 
care. It was totally immaterial for the little guy

05:16.140 --> 05:18.523
out in the village. And a lot of them couldn't tell 
you anything in the world about what was going on

05:19.444 --> 05:23.308
outside their own village. As far as Saigon, they 
didn't know who or what or when. They didn't care.

05:28.693 --> 05:37.848
It didn't affect them, except they had to pay taxes 
to the Arvin, and they turned around and paid taxes

05:28.693 --> 05:37.848
to VC when they came through the collection. Like I 
said, if you could get one of them to talk to you,

05:37.868 --> 05:42.655
there was no Arvin around. He'd tell you, why don't 
y'all go home? And one of these two people decide

05:45.597 --> 05:49.703
who's going to be in charge and who'll get on with 
their life. That was pretty much the thing that I

05:49.723 --> 05:56.152
could get from an average guy out there on the farm. 
It didn't really surprise me when it went out

05:56.212 --> 05:59.897
there. Dr. Anderson in class has talked about his 
trip back to Vietnam, and he's planning to go

06:00.117 --> 06:05.625
again. Would you be interested at all in ever going 
back, or say as a tourist? No. I don't. You don't

06:13.876 --> 06:15.418
feel any attachment or anything? I have no 
attachment there. If it were as a tourist and there

06:19.180 --> 06:26.910
was something they could offer me, it would be 
worthwhile to see. I might go as a tourist to see

06:27.130 --> 06:30.575
something I might have missed when I wasn't there. 
But I don't know of anything in Vietnam that I would

06:30.595 --> 06:36.162
care to go back to see. I saw a good deal of it while I 
was there. Probably a closer perspective than

06:39.166 --> 06:43.772
most tourists will ever get to see it. And 
certainly a better perspective of it than most GIs

06:46.027 --> 06:54.741
who went over and worked with pure American units. 
Most of those never got to see much more than the

06:54.761 --> 07:00.550
base they were stationed at or the jungle they were 
trooping around in, and that's not a very good view

06:54.761 --> 07:00.550
of it. With the advisory we got out, there was very 
little that I didn't know about my own province,

07:01.572 --> 07:10.887
very little that I hadn't seen or been into. a 
couple of the bordering provinces and up and

07:11.710 --> 07:14.394
around Saigon. I made a few trips around the 
country to see what it looked like, visit with

07:14.674 --> 07:23.787
other teams to see how they were doing and what they 
were doing that we might incorporate into our

07:14.674 --> 07:23.787
effects. I probably got to see more of Vietnam than 
any tourist will ever get to see. I have no feeling

07:31.167 --> 07:35.233
about going back there. There's nobody there. I 
want to see how it turned out, as I know pretty much

07:36.635 --> 07:40.601
how it turned out. I haven't talked to them before I 
left. I knew pretty much what was going on there. I

07:45.528 --> 07:48.192
don't care if I can see them. If you get down to the 
local level, you find that life hasn't changed

07:48.212 --> 07:53.419
very much at all. Maybe a little bit more hungry and 
a little bit less... well-fed or taken care of, but

07:59.045 --> 08:07.476
I don't think overall the peasant's life changed a 
great deal. Harder to be certain. One last

08:10.139 --> 08:12.562
hypothetical question here. After Ted, you were 
saying, do you think if we stepped up our presence

08:13.524 --> 08:24.838
there and say, had we gone ahead and won, had there 
been no negative view in the media and had it been

08:13.524 --> 08:24.838
okay? Even if we had won, do you think that would 
have just you know, quashed the will of the North

08:28.643 --> 08:34.290
Vietnamese, or would there have been another 
uprising, you think?

08:37.695 --> 08:51.833
Well, if you're going on the assumption that we 
could have achieved a peace where the country

08:37.695 --> 08:51.833
would have remained divided, if that's what 
you're asking, then I don't think a lasting peace

08:37.695 --> 08:51.833
could have been established on that basis. The 
sole purpose of the North was to reunite the

08:52.854 --> 08:55.798
country. under one government. Given that, they 
might have accepted a temporary truce or peace

08:58.284 --> 09:05.734
because of their losses or whatever that we could 
have inflicted upon them if they did that. I think

09:05.794 --> 09:11.062
it probably would have been a temporary thing. You 
might wind up with a situation like you have in

09:12.003 --> 09:22.378
Korea, where since 1953, we've been a divided 
country there, and the fighting has been off and

09:12.003 --> 09:22.378
on. And even today, they're still fighting here. 
It might have evolved into something like that,

09:26.373 --> 09:31.260
but I don't think there would ever have been any 
real true peace. And I think probably it would not

09:31.500 --> 09:41.914
have stabilized my career because the North 
Koreans were much, much more aggressive about

09:31.500 --> 09:41.914
reuniting the country than the North Koreans 
were. So it may have stabilized for a year, maybe

09:44.278 --> 09:51.688
two or three, and I think people would turn around 
and start holding it over again. But we would never

09:51.708 --> 09:55.333
really have gotten rid of the VC whatever academy 
still down in the south they've still been in place

09:56.731 --> 10:24.831
still working for a different form of government 
if they could have achieved a government where you

09:56.731 --> 10:24.831
had equal representation between bc and normal 
people maybe maybe it might have stabilized but

09:56.731 --> 10:24.831
that didn't work too well in layoffs either where 
they established any coalition government it

09:56.731 --> 10:24.831
fell apart coalition governments are not the 
answer One side of it is a bet on having the whole

10:25.756 --> 10:30.861
country under their control, but I don't see how 
you're going to alter that. You may delay it, but

10:30.881 --> 10:38.188
you won't alter it until you eventually start over

10:30.881 --> 10:38.188
again. It's like a comparison to North Korea. It's 
like sitting on top of a bomb over there with a short

10:39.470 --> 10:43.053
fuse, and the fuse is burning. When is it going to 
explode again? The last time I was over there, this

10:45.336 --> 10:49.940
was after Vietnam. We were close to going back to 
war there. Something as simple as a matter of

10:52.282 --> 10:54.885
cutting down a tree.

10:57.532 --> 11:08.407
I don't know if you can look it up, but there was an 
incident where an American officer got killed in

10:57.532 --> 11:08.407
the DMZ by North Korean troops. And all they were 
trying to do was cut down a tree and kill him. And we

11:11.631 --> 11:17.680
were on DEFCON 1, which was defensive condition 
one. The only thing that was left was simply blow

11:17.700 --> 11:23.187
one more whistle and we were over again. And they 
sent people in there. armed to cut down a tree. Had

11:27.951 --> 11:32.679
they been fired upon, we would have been at war. 
Very simple as that. It was kind of a powder keg. I

11:35.523 --> 11:41.432
think we would have wound up with essentially the 
same situation in Vietnam if they had achieved

11:35.523 --> 11:41.432
another peace. How long it would have lasted is a 
conjecture. But I don't think it would have

11:46.519 --> 11:49.243
lasted, not like Korea has. Okay, I don't have any 
further questions. Do you have anything else to

11:52.428 --> 11:53.610
add? No, not particularly.

12:00.908 --> 12:08.897
I think it was an experience, but on the whole, I 
never really viewed it as going anywhere. It was

12:09.237 --> 12:15.664
just simply part of the job, but I couldn't see it 
being productive. You know, like World War I,

12:15.684 --> 12:24.694
World War II, when we achieved a solution by arms, I 
could not see it reaching that degree. It was part

12:25.771 --> 12:26.715
of the job. I did it. That's what I signed on to do.

12:31.794 --> 12:32.175
Okay. Well, that concludes our interview. Thank 
you, Mr. Price.
