00:02.275 --> 00:07.220
Interview with Dr. Laura Summers, visiting 
fellow at Sri Lanka University, Bangkok,

00:02.275 --> 00:07.220
Thailand. Question one. Do you feel that the Khmer 
Rouge should be involved in a coalition

00:09.322 --> 00:13.066
government? Why?

00:18.512 --> 00:28.362
Let me begin to answer this question by saying 
something about how I understand the position of

00:18.512 --> 00:28.362
those who oppose having the Khmer Rouge in a 
coalition government. I think most of the...

00:32.262 --> 00:38.863
campaign against Khmer Rouge involvement in the 
coalition. is motivated by or informed by some

00:40.160 --> 00:50.193
Western notions of justice or morality. I have 
friends, and I'm sure you have friends, who say

00:51.075 --> 01:07.737
things like, they're responsible for so much 
killing, they don't deserve to be in power, or it

00:51.075 --> 01:07.737
would be immoral for them to be put back in power 
because it was for example unthinkable or immoral

01:07.717 --> 01:21.270
that the fascists in Germany should be put back 
into power after they were defeated in the war well

01:21.740 --> 01:47.275
i want to stress that

01:21.740 --> 01:47.275
the arguments that you hear about this tend to 
issue out of western experience and western

01:21.740 --> 01:47.275
values and they represent a projection of certain 
democratic ideas of representation

01:47.660 --> 02:02.407
And while I don't reject those values, and of 
course we support those values, I want to suggest

01:47.660 --> 02:02.407
to you that these arguments are unrealistic. 
They're unrealistic if you look at the problem of a

02:03.429 --> 02:11.423
coalition government within the framework of 
Cambodian politics. so now let me answer the

02:12.517 --> 02:41.798
question that's the introduction but my answer to 
the question is that of course the Khmer Rouge must

02:12.517 --> 02:41.798
be involved in the coalition government and I say 
this for two reasons I say of course they must be

02:12.517 --> 02:41.798
involved because of certain political and that 
includes military realities on the ground And the

02:42.233 --> 02:55.889
second reason I say they must be involved is, and I 
want to be very careful about how I say this, they

02:42.233 --> 02:55.889
must be involved because in some sense I would 
argue they deserve to be involved. And I say they

02:57.291 --> 03:07.583
deserve to be involved from the standpoint of what 
has been happening inside Cambodian

02:57.291 --> 03:07.583
nationalism. and when you look at Khmer Rouge from 
that standpoint you can see that they still have

03:07.563 --> 03:24.492
some support not as much as they had in the early 70s 
and maybe more than they deserve in quotation

03:07.563 --> 03:24.492
marks But the simple historical fact of the matter 
is that they are recognized by some Cambodians as

03:24.472 --> 03:51.019
the leading nationalist force, as a group of 
people who still by and large represent the

03:24.472 --> 03:51.019
interests of poor country people, poor peasants, 
and as people who in standing up against the

03:51.573 --> 04:14.458
Vietnamese invasion have in some sense 
vindicated themselves although I think nobody

03:51.573 --> 04:14.458
has forgotten about the suffering and the 
killings from the 1970s that would be pretty

03:51.573 --> 04:14.458
impossible because the scale was large OK, but let 
me sum up by saying They really must be involved in

04:14.962 --> 04:23.218
the coalition because that's the price, in some 
sense, for peace. Le Premier Rouge still have the

04:25.643 --> 04:36.143
largest, most disciplined, most coherent army 
and political movement whatever we think of it and

04:36.123 --> 04:52.225
certainly it's not a movement or party that many 
foreigners would join whatever we think of it they

04:36.123 --> 04:52.225
have political power on the ground And as you know 
in political science, we're talking about

04:52.525 --> 05:03.179
conflict resolution, we're talking about 
settlement of disputes. This is a process which

05:04.281 --> 05:12.171
involves compromise amongst those groups which 
have power of one sort or another. either military

05:12.151 --> 05:41.500
power as in the case of Khmer Rouge royal and 
culturalist power in the case of Sihanouk whose

05:12.151 --> 05:41.500
army isn't so impressive but Sihanouk himself is 
widely recognized as being essential to a

05:12.151 --> 05:41.500
coalition because monarchy is central to the 
sense of stability and well-being in Cambodian

05:12.151 --> 05:41.500
society so Sihanouk has a form of power which we can 
label social and cultural power, as well as

05:41.480 --> 05:48.927
political power. Monarchy is the fulcrum and has 
always been the center of Khmer politics. It's

05:54.873 --> 06:00.298
probably less the center of Khmer politics now 
than it was 20 or 30 years ago. But again, it's still

06:00.318 --> 06:03.161
important. Sihanouk represents a kind of power 
which must be taken into account in a settlement.

06:09.509 --> 06:14.257
And similarly, the KPNLF must be involved in the 
settlement. The KPNLF involves a lot of middle

06:14.277 --> 06:36.293
class, urban people, people with technical 
skills, former high civil servants, former

06:14.277 --> 06:36.293
teachers, the best and the brightest, if you like, 
of Cambodians. they don't have much support in the

06:37.910 --> 07:06.465
countryside peasants don't understand that 
party and that movement very much but

06:37.910 --> 07:06.465
nevertheless if you're going to have a government 
that can really govern a government that can

06:37.910 --> 07:06.465
pursue development policies you've got to have 
engineers you've got to have accountants you've

06:37.910 --> 07:06.465
got to have statisticians you've got to have 
bankers financiers and businessmen and those are

06:37.910 --> 07:06.465
the KPM people they must be included in a coalition 
as well also and this is not unimportant they're

06:37.910 --> 07:06.465
the people who speak the best to foreigners. 
They're the people who have been educated abroad.

07:10.870 --> 07:17.636
They're the people who can provide an important 
bridge between Cambodian politics and the

07:10.870 --> 07:17.636
politics of the rest of the world. And let me just 
finish by saying that the Hun Sen Heng Sum Rin Party

07:19.578 --> 07:29.709
must, of course, be included in the coalition, 
too. All four parties have to be included in the

07:29.729 --> 07:32.892
coalition. and I say this because they have 
succeeded with a lot of Vietnamese and Soviet help

07:34.289 --> 07:53.698
in putting together a new state administration 
not a very strong one but in some sense a reasonably

07:54.607 --> 08:19.770
effective one in administrative terms I don't 
think that the Hang Sam Rin Hun Sen party is very

07:54.607 --> 08:19.770
strong politically and that's because if you ask 
the question who has power and what kind of power

07:54.607 --> 08:19.770
they have the answer to those questions in the case 
of the Hang Sam Rin Hun Sen people is they have

08:21.421 --> 08:36.932
vietnamese military power behind them they're 
the base of that administration the base of that

08:21.421 --> 08:36.932
communist party is the vietnamese army right 
they've had 10 years to try to build it into

08:21.421 --> 08:36.932
something more and something different and there 
really isn't a great deal of evidence to suggest

08:37.385 --> 08:57.267
that they've made much progress Nevertheless, 
the administration functions a bit the hospitals

08:37.385 --> 08:57.267
are functioning, the schools are functioning 
you've got a lot of people drawing salaries from

08:37.385 --> 08:57.267
the ministries and there's a framework there and 
there's a party with very low morale to which most

08:57.888 --> 09:22.647
of these civil servants have rallied they join it 
because it's associated with getting jobs

08:57.888 --> 09:22.647
there's a framework there of a sort of 
administrative power or state power which has to

08:57.888 --> 09:22.647
be taken into account in a settlement and in the 
formation of let me stress an interim coalition

08:57.888 --> 09:22.647
government when people talk about coalition 
government now they're talking about two

09:22.627 --> 09:44.010
different kinds of coalitions firstly they're 
talking about some form of armistice or ceasefire

09:22.627 --> 09:44.010
that can be arranged in the near future alongside 
the creation of an interim political authority

09:43.990 --> 10:13.542
the term authority was used by the Paris 
conference because the term government has

09:43.990 --> 10:13.542
become so controversial so the CGDK wants to 
defend its legal position as the only worldwide

09:43.990 --> 10:13.542
recognized legal government and the Hun Sen 
people still want to claim that their government

09:43.990 --> 10:13.542
ought to be recognized so the politics of this is 
being worked on internationally by more and more

10:13.522 --> 10:36.998
people speaking in terms of the formation of an 
interim coalition authority which would oversee

10:13.522 --> 10:36.998
an armistice along with some sort of 
international control mechanism and which would

10:13.522 --> 10:36.998
be the Cambodian component of some sort of 
international control mechanism which would

10:13.522 --> 10:36.998
arrange elections in which all parties could 
participate and which would presumably produce

10:36.978 --> 10:59.695
an elected coalition government which would be a 
proper legally constituted government formed as

10:36.978 --> 10:59.695
a result of an act of self-determination on the 
part of all Cambodian voters maybe that's enough

11:01.598 --> 11:29.277
on that question

11:01.598 --> 11:29.277
question two have the Vietnamese pulled out of 
Cambodia

11:01.598 --> 11:29.277
sub question a why won't they let the UN verify 
their withdrawal and question sub question b will

11:01.598 --> 11:29.277
they come back if the guerrilla forces get too 
close to Phnom Penh

11:33.340 --> 11:54.859
Well, these are straightforward questions, I'll 
take them in order Yes,

11:33.340 --> 11:54.859
the Vietnamese have pulled out of Khenpo Chia in 
one particular sense The Vietnamese have pulled

11:33.340 --> 11:54.859
out their organized combat battalions they have 
turned full responsibility for battlefield

11:56.442 --> 12:25.217
fighting over to the Heng San Ren army to put this in 
another way so in that sense in that specific

11:56.442 --> 12:25.217
military sense the Vietnamese army has pulled out 
Kampuchea but politically speaking Vietnam has

11:56.442 --> 12:25.217
not pulled out of Campuchia, not at all. Not at all, 
and there should be no confusion about this. The

12:33.562 --> 12:37.165
Vietnamese have admitted they have left an 
advisory corps behind. There have been reliable

12:38.587 --> 12:52.179
reports that there are five Vietnamese 
consulates, so-called, strategically placed

12:38.587 --> 12:52.179
around the country to oversee, to supervise the 
fighting. So there's a large advisory, military

12:52.800 --> 12:58.225
advisory structure there. and there is 
undoubtedly still a core of Vietnamese advisors

12:58.627 --> 13:27.925
attached to the Heng Sam Rin Communist Party 
political bureau and central committee to

12:58.627 --> 13:27.925
continue to advise them about political matters 
about propaganda about what to say this week or

12:58.627 --> 13:27.925
tomorrow or what have you there's no doubt about it 
and politically too Vietnam has not pulled out of

12:58.627 --> 13:27.925
Kampuchea in the following sense From the 
beginning, the invasion, the replacement of the

13:29.373 --> 13:57.642
Pol Pot government by a government of Vietnam's 
own choosing, was part of a broad political and

13:29.373 --> 13:57.642
social and economic and historical

13:29.373 --> 13:57.642
strategy or development on the part of the 
Vietnamese Communist Party and the Vietnamese

13:29.373 --> 13:57.642
revolution. the

13:59.123 --> 14:07.562
developmental outlook goes something like this. 
Khenpochiya allows to form, in some sense, an

14:07.582 --> 14:17.385
essential part of Indochina, if I can use the old 
colonial term, in economic terms, because the

14:18.074 --> 14:33.180
French began the process of economic 
modernization in that part of Southeast Asia. by

14:33.160 --> 14:38.928
coordinating the economies of those former 
French territories. Saigon, as it was known then,

14:40.269 --> 14:45.336
was the economic capital of Indochina. Hanoi was 
the political capital. The Governor General of

14:49.241 --> 15:01.497
France was based in Hanoi, and he oversaw 
political, economic, and social developments in

14:49.241 --> 15:01.497
all five territories of Indochina from Hanoi. So 
from those times Laos and Cambodia were two

15:01.477 --> 15:27.990
provinces if you like of Indochina which was 
centered in Vietnam Now for some of the old

15:01.477 --> 15:27.990
generation of Vietnamese Communist Party this 
formative colonial experience which was 90 years

15:01.477 --> 15:27.990
long effectively in the case of Cambodia in 
economic materialist terms remember they're

15:28.797 --> 15:49.152
serious Marxists in economic materialist terms 
this determined historically that the

15:28.797 --> 15:49.152
development economically and historically of 
all the territories here would be integrated for

15:28.797 --> 15:49.152
all times and in in modern market terms it makes 
some sense this argument Vietnam's a very densely

15:50.060 --> 16:17.940
populated too heavily populated country there's 
not enough land to feed all of the Vietnamese

15:50.060 --> 16:17.940
Vietnam technologically speaking is fairly 
advanced highly urbanized lots of factories very

15:50.060 --> 16:17.940
well educated population but the country lacks 
raw materials for those factories Laos is rich in

16:17.920 --> 16:45.548
minerals and timber and lots of raw materials 
which are necessary in Vietnam to keep the

16:17.920 --> 16:45.548
industries going Campuchia is rich in land, rich 
in food and during the French colonial period

16:17.920 --> 16:45.548
Campuchian food was used to feed the people in Goch 
in China at the same time that the French invested

16:17.920 --> 16:45.548
in industries and rubber plantations there so 
there's a long momentum if you like behind

16:46.102 --> 17:04.110
Vietnamese nationalism and Vietnamese 
communism which leads a lot of the leadership in

16:46.102 --> 17:04.110
the party to see Laos and Campuchia as absolutely 
vital to their national security and their

17:04.310 --> 17:29.473
national security in economic terms as well as in 
military terms the Vietnamese will often say

17:04.310 --> 17:29.473
things like we have been invaded from the sea so 
many times in the last 10 centuries and we have been

17:04.310 --> 17:29.473
invaded from the West by the Thais incidentally on 
occasion through Cambodia through Laos you know

17:29.723 --> 17:56.254
so many times and they can recite all the wars and 
the names of the military commanders and the kings

17:29.723 --> 17:56.254
who were involved and so it it is a part of 
Vietnamese nationalism and Vietnamese

17:29.723 --> 17:56.254
communism that these security considerations of 
these economic considerations make them at the

17:29.723 --> 17:56.254
very least extremely conscious of the importance 
of having sympathetic governments in Laos and

17:56.622 --> 18:26.173
Cambodia at a minimum the governments have to be 
sympathetic and for some Vietnamese communists

17:56.622 --> 18:26.173
and nationalists it goes further than that there 
is an expectation that those governments must be

17:56.622 --> 18:26.173
allies of Vietnam that they must cooperate fully 
with the Vietnamese in economic development and

17:56.622 --> 18:26.173
in military security

17:56.622 --> 18:26.173
matters that in fact the whole of former French 
Indochina must be regarded historically and in

18:26.963 --> 18:43.217
practical policy terms as one solidarity block 
the Vietnamese to use this language which is

18:45.222 --> 19:12.867
inspired by Brezhnev's old limited sovereignty 
doctrine which was developed in Eastern Europe

18:45.222 --> 19:12.867
and the Vietnamese look at Eastern Europe and the 
relationship between the Soviet Union and

18:45.222 --> 19:12.867
Eastern Europe and they draw parallels between 
themselves and Laos and Cambridgeshire and so

18:45.222 --> 19:12.867
they formulate these theoretical arguments and 
this language of an Indo-Chinese solidarity bloc

18:45.222 --> 19:12.867
which they used up until about 85 and then they 
dropped it on the basis of their Marxist

19:13.657 --> 19:22.221
theorizing and their historical analysis. But 
more to the point of your question, they formulate

19:24.170 --> 19:52.287
real policies on the basis of this theory and on the 
basis of these historical conditions and so in the

19:24.170 --> 19:52.287
very broadest sense this is why they invaded 
Cambodia this is why they toppled the Pol Pot

19:24.170 --> 19:52.287
government and put their own government in power 
and set up a new communist party set up a new

19:24.170 --> 19:52.287
communist army which would be loyal to their own 
and allied with their own and set up a new state a

19:52.267 --> 20:17.025
state of an entirely new character there's never 
been a socialist state in Cambodia before like

19:52.267 --> 20:17.025
this one Paul Park of course had hardly any central 
government at all so this is the first time you have

19:52.267 --> 20:17.025
the kind of full apparatus state apparatus in 
Cambodia. I guess maybe to go back to the first

20:21.052 --> 20:37.680
question, it's this apparatus which has somehow 
to be taken into account now when people talk about

20:21.052 --> 20:37.680
an interim political authority or a 
post-election coalition government. well I

20:39.500 --> 21:02.352
think I've answered your second question already 
second sub-question will they come back if the

20:39.500 --> 21:02.352
guerrilla forces get too close to Phnom Penh of 
course they will of course they will there's no

20:39.500 --> 21:02.352
doubt about it because one politically I'm saying 
they never left you know it's a trick if you like

20:39.500 --> 21:02.352
they pull out the troops so you know journalists 
can go take pictures and say ah they're gone you

20:39.500 --> 21:02.352
know Pilger can put in his film shots of the 
Vietnamese withdrawing but that conveys the

21:02.332 --> 21:27.293
wrong sort of political message militarily yes, 
they've made a show of pulling out politically no

21:02.332 --> 21:27.293
they have militarily pulled out so that 
politically they can stand firm

21:02.332 --> 21:27.293
and that brings me to the final sub-question it's 
because they are standing from because

21:27.526 --> 21:48.150
politically they've not given up their basic 
enterprise but they don't want the UN in there they

21:27.526 --> 21:48.150
don't want their withdrawal verified because of 
course it can't be if they have the UN in they're in

21:27.526 --> 21:48.150
trouble but to cover up for this they're using all 
sorts of excuses and pretexts about the UN having

21:48.721 --> 22:11.050
been biased over the last 10 years because the 
Vietnamese have never accepted that their

21:48.721 --> 22:11.050
invasion is in violation of the UN Charter and it 
certainly is, without a doubt the Vietnamese have

21:48.721 --> 22:11.050
never accepted that their invasion is in any sense 
in international law illegal and of course it's

22:11.587 --> 22:30.675
illegal but the Vietnamese talk about 
proletarian internationalism they talk just

22:11.587 --> 22:30.675
like the American government used to 
incidentally about being invited in by by an

22:11.587 --> 22:30.675
indigenous revolutionary force because they 
pretend that the Heng Sam Rin Hun Sen Party arose

22:31.280 --> 22:54.570
out of an indigenous civil war with the pop-up 
forces they ignore that they brought all these

22:31.280 --> 22:54.570
people out of vietnam and out of vietnamese 
prisons in fact and put them they claim that there

22:31.280 --> 22:54.570
was an indigenous uprising which they were asked 
to support and in the name of pro-italian

22:31.280 --> 22:54.570
internationalism they supported it and their 
argument is that the people have spoken they've

22:55.360 --> 23:14.432
spoken out against paul pott they supported this 
indigenous uprising and therefore government

22:55.360 --> 23:14.432
and party are genuine governments because they 
are people's democracies because there's a

22:55.360 --> 23:14.432
genuine people's revolutionary party there This 
is the significance of the names that were given to

23:14.412 --> 23:28.855
the People's Republic of Kampuchea and to the 
Kampuchean People's Revolutionary Party of Aung

23:14.412 --> 23:28.855
San Suu Kyi. So they won't let the UN come in to 
verify because the UN hasn't recognized the

23:33.582 --> 23:52.013
so-called legal government from their point of 
view and now at the Paris conference or in speeches

23:33.582 --> 23:52.013
Nguyen Quoc Tac, the Vietnamese foreign minister 
denounces the UN all the time because it is

23:33.582 --> 23:52.013
prejudiced and biased and claims the UN will not be 
an objective and fair observer of either a

23:51.993 --> 24:02.724
ceasefire or the Vietnamese withdrawal or any 
other form of international control and

23:51.993 --> 24:02.724
supervision. That's a pretext. And there's a 
serious debate here about the legality of

24:04.886 --> 24:08.710
everything.

24:18.239 --> 24:19.300
Question three. What effect will the recent 
semi-recognition given by the UK and others have

24:20.360 --> 24:29.075
on negotiations? I like the way you put this, 
semi-recognition. It was in the paper again today

24:34.184 --> 24:43.380
that it did not recognize and had not changed the 
policy.

24:43.647 --> 24:58.686
I think semi-recognition is too strong here and I 
think the British position might be a little

24:43.647 --> 24:58.686
different from everybody else's so let me as a 
British academic speak to the British situation

24:43.647 --> 24:58.686
first There have been some particular problems in 
Britain in the last six or eight months. Problems

25:06.728 --> 25:14.565
within the Foreign Office linked to cabinet 
instability in Britain itself. and some problems

25:14.883 --> 25:32.200
linked to relations with Vietnam cabinet 
instability I can deal with very quickly the

25:14.883 --> 25:32.200
Thatcher regime's regime the Thatcher 
government I should call it it is a sort of regime

25:33.513 --> 25:39.044
Thatcher is in a certain amount of political 
difficulty at the moment. Economic policy isn't

25:39.064 --> 25:41.368
working out too well. She's isolated in Europe and 
the opinion polls show that she's not as super

25:41.428 --> 25:51.387
popular as she used to be. In fact, she's a little 
bit like Reagan. Her popularity ratings are

25:54.892 --> 26:08.025
usually, her personal popularity ratings have 
usually been a little bit better than the

25:54.892 --> 26:08.025
support ratings for her policies. but in any case 
the problems internally have led to a couple of

26:08.950 --> 26:33.355
major cabinet reshuffles and the foreign 
ministry has suffered as I point out in this little

26:08.950 --> 26:33.355
discussion paper Britain has had three foreign 
ministers in the last four months and in the

26:08.950 --> 26:33.355
British system this represents a certain amount 
of disorganization Geoffrey Howe had been

26:33.773 --> 27:02.886
foreign minister for a long time and very familiar 
with Cambodian affairs very sharp on the

26:33.773 --> 27:02.886
Cambodian matters but he was sacked for all 
intents and purposes in July during the cabinet

26:33.773 --> 27:02.886
reshuffle and replaced by John Major from the 
treasury John Major is a specialist on economic

26:33.773 --> 27:02.886
matters and doesn't have much experience in 
foreign affairs Nevertheless, he was an able

27:02.866 --> 27:11.296
person, but you just can't put somebody in that job 
and expect them to be on top of things overnight.

27:13.239 --> 27:28.738
And then John Major was moved out of the Foreign 
Office into the Chancellor of the Exchequer's job

27:13.239 --> 27:28.738
when Nigel Lawson abruptly resigned from that 
important job in October. So British foreign

27:29.680 --> 27:57.831
policy has had no strong hand at the helm for many 
months and this coincides with a real crisis in

27:29.680 --> 27:57.831
Hong Kong involving the Vietnamese boat people 
Britain has agreed, has promised China, that is

27:29.680 --> 27:57.831
the PRC that all of the Vietnamese refugees in Hong 
Kong will be out by 1997 and there are now over

27:58.520 --> 28:26.518
50,000 of these people and they're living in 
appalling conditions really they're

27:58.520 --> 28:26.518
incarcerated they're living in prison 
conditions which they shouldn't have to endure

27:58.520 --> 28:26.518
but space problems in Hong Kong are just generally 
horrific and in fact a lot of these people

27:58.520 --> 28:26.518
apparently do not qualify for refugee status in 
accordance to international law even though they

28:26.667 --> 28:33.701
are afraid to go back to Vietnam and don't have a 
very good life there. In any case, for reasons that

28:35.465 --> 28:46.347
you and I will probably never fully know about, the 
British government decided some months ago, this

28:35.465 --> 28:46.347
happened before I left Britain, they decided 
effectively really in June that they were going to

28:46.917 --> 29:16.333
forcibly deport these people from Hong Kong and 
there then arose a problem with how to get the

28:46.917 --> 29:16.333
Vietnamese government to accept them to get the 
Vietnamese to help Britain out of its dilemma in

28:46.917 --> 29:16.333
Hong Kong and its treaty commitments to China so 
there have been quiet negotiations with Vietnam

29:17.798 --> 29:22.763
And the Vietnamese cause have been looking for 
some quid pro quo. And Cambodia always comes up in

29:23.984 --> 29:29.430
these discussions. And Britain, without 
breaking ranks with the European community and

29:29.450 --> 29:44.025
the US, has always said that they will provide aid 
and will resume trade with Vietnam as soon as

29:29.450 --> 29:44.025
they're out of Cambodia. the Vietnamese say well 
we're pulling on our troops at the end of September

29:44.427 --> 30:09.692
that's the time isn't it so in a sense the 
Vietnamese have been pushing Britain and maybe

29:44.427 --> 30:09.692
Britain before the other European countries for 
some positive reciprocal response to the

29:44.427 --> 30:09.692
withdrawal and in some measure I see the British 
government making this small gesture in response

30:10.313 --> 30:30.364
to Vietnamese military withdrawals but Britain 
is not going to recognize the Phnom Penh

30:10.313 --> 30:30.364
government and I'm sure they told Vietnam not 
Britain is prepared to extend some recognition to

30:30.968 --> 30:56.082
Vietnam for having withdrawn militarily, is 
prepared to extend some recognition to the Hun Sen

30:30.968 --> 30:56.082
administration, acknowledging in some measure 
that it must be part of some settlement, it's not

30:30.968 --> 30:56.082
going to be permanently kept in the cold and 
isolated in Western strategic thinking. and so

30:56.062 --> 31:24.600
the sending of a British diplomat to Phnom Penh to 
talk with British aid agencies in Phnom Penh but

30:56.062 --> 31:24.600
not to anybody in that administration is a halfway 
gesture it is in no sense recognition and in fact

30:56.062 --> 31:24.600
the way the British have done it is to reconfirm 
that Britain, along with most of the countries of

30:56.062 --> 31:24.600
the world still does not recognize the legality of 
that government imposed by a foreign invasion and

31:24.580 --> 31:54.132
comprised of people who were handpicked by a 
foreign government and

31:24.580 --> 31:54.132
a foreign party For the rest of the countries 
alluded to here by reference to others I don't know

31:24.580 --> 31:54.132
really what to say because nobody else is gone very 
far. the US press has given Hun Sen some really

31:58.600 --> 32:27.679
quite extraordinary recognition lately but the 
US government hasn't budged a bit on the

31:58.600 --> 32:27.679
recognition question and I wouldn't expect them 
to frankly

31:58.600 --> 32:27.679
the US is strongly behind the UN position on the 
question of recognition

32:30.477 --> 32:39.203
France has never recognized either the CGDK or the 
Phnom Penh government. France has tried to play a

32:39.223 --> 32:42.192
neutral role tried to play a mediating role as a 
former colonial power, and it continues to do so

32:42.661 --> 32:48.570
today. This was one of the reasons the Paris 
Conference was held in Paris rather than

32:48.610 --> 32:53.678
elsewhere. And as far as I'm aware, the French have 
not budged from their strictly neutral position.

33:01.029 --> 33:07.398
They have a CGDK diplomatic mission in Paris. They 
allow diplomatic missions to come from Phnom

33:09.982 --> 33:13.527
Penh. They have lines to both sides, if you like. 
They've always had their aid agencies in Phnom

33:18.753 --> 33:24.381
Penh. Madame Mitterrand has a private aid agency, 
which has always worked in Phnom Penh. French

33:30.328 --> 33:33.192
policy hasn't changed at all in recent months.

33:36.036 --> 33:37.137
What about the Australian? the Australian, 
there's been a lot of noise about the Australian

33:37.876 --> 34:05.993
policy and the ambassador here in Bangkok is 
clearly more sympathetic towards Phnom Penh than

33:37.876 --> 34:05.993
some people in the Australian foreign ministry 
and his position is really not always in keeping

33:37.876 --> 34:05.993
with the position of the Australian government 
and he has recently been rebuked for some of his

33:37.876 --> 34:05.993
statements here in Bangkok Australia's policy is 
absolutely clear their policy about recognising

34:05.973 --> 34:26.462
states and recognising governments is slightly 
unusual within world legal terms they do not

34:05.973 --> 34:26.462
recognise governments, they recognise states so 
they recognise that there is an independent state

34:05.973 --> 34:26.462
of Cambodia but legal conditions are such that 
Australia does not officially know I'm putting

34:26.442 --> 34:56.449
quotation marks around know where the government 
of this state of Cambodia is so they do not

34:26.442 --> 34:56.449
recognize Phnom Penh they do not recognize the 
CGDK and officially they have told the Hun Sen

34:26.442 --> 34:56.449
government that they will not treat with Phnom 
Penh in the normal international diplomatic

34:56.429 --> 35:16.362
matter they cannot trade with phnom penh they 
cannot receive phnom penh delegations as legally

34:56.429 --> 35:16.362
recognized delegations in australia and they 
similarly similarly they cannot do this with cgdk

34:56.429 --> 35:16.362
and they will not do it for either government until 
the legal position of one or the other is

35:16.831 --> 35:42.315
normalized and then Australia will recognize and 
Australia will trade I've recently received a

35:16.831 --> 35:42.315
paper from the Australian Foreign Ministry in 
which it is clearly stated that Australia will not

35:16.831 --> 35:42.315
resume bilateral aid to Cambodia a state it 
recognizes until there is an internationally

35:42.295 --> 36:12.184
recognized political authority there and 
they're speaking in terms of an interim political

35:42.295 --> 36:12.184
authority as soon as there is some beginning of a 
series of steps toward the settlement and an

35:42.295 --> 36:12.184
interim political authority is established 
under the auspices of the Paris conference

35:42.295 --> 36:12.184
Australia is prepared to resume aid everyone will 
resume aid then Australia has also repeatedly

35:42.295 --> 36:12.184
made it clear that while it's interested in trade 
with Indochina and normalizing relations with

36:12.451 --> 36:34.037
all of Indochina that its relations with the ASEAN 
countries and its trade with the ASEAN countries

36:12.451 --> 36:34.037
is infinitely more important and Australia has 
repeatedly said it will not take the lead on

36:12.451 --> 36:34.037
Cambodia and on the Himalaya work with the ASEAN 
countries and cooperate with the ASEAN countries

36:34.017 --> 36:49.880
and will not enter into any relationship with 
either Vietnam or Cambodia, which will

36:34.017 --> 36:49.880
jeopardize its relationships with the ASEAN 
countries? Well, I don't think even more needs to

36:49.900 --> 36:53.545
be said about that question.
