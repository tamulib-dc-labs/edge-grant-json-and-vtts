00:09.565 --> 00:16.554
This is an interview with Dr. Glenn Hallmark, 
retired head of the Department of Electrical

00:09.565 --> 00:16.554
Engineering at Texas A&M. Today's date is 
September 24, 1981. Let's begin, Dr. Hallmark, by

00:22.861 --> 00:27.207
your telling us something about your early years 
in Killeen. You were born there in 1913. Born there

00:28.989 --> 00:37.800
in 1913 and lived, I believe, until 1920 in Killeen 
and then moved to Delta. nearby

00:38.793 --> 00:48.346
until I began high school. And then, through high 
school years, I lived in Houston and Waco. What

00:52.933 --> 00:56.378
happened to you? What was your father's 
occupation? He was a cotton buyer for a major

00:58.280 --> 00:59.462
cotton exporting company. And that's why

00:59.482 --> 01:03.488
you moved? Uh, no.

01:07.177 --> 01:11.162
The several moves during high school took place 
after my father's death. He died about the time I

01:11.263 --> 01:14.887
started high school. What about your mother? 
Well, my mother lived until 1963.

01:23.018 --> 01:27.184
After your father died, how did your mother 
support the family? Well, we had four children,

01:27.204 --> 01:35.796
all of us, and the four children worked. When did 
you start working? No, I worked in

01:38.142 --> 01:42.448
high school. I didn't contribute a great deal 
while I was in high school, but I worked in high

01:42.468 --> 01:47.694
school and college. By that time, the other kids 
were older than I. They were working and helped. It

01:54.784 --> 01:56.145
was a family undertaking. We all went to college.

02:04.336 --> 02:06.799
That was not unusual in those days. What year did 
your father die? 1927.

02:14.816 --> 02:17.580
Where did you graduate from high school? In 
Abilene. What was the name of the school? There was

02:19.262 --> 02:24.309
only one high school in Abilene, and it might have 
had a name, but I don't remember. It was Abilene

02:24.329 --> 02:26.032
High School. What year was that? 1930. And after 
graduation from high school, what did you do? Then

02:32.200 --> 02:33.462
I entered A&M. What year? Electrical 
engineering. You got your degree, bachelor's

02:36.555 --> 02:38.819
degree at A&M? Yes. In what year? 35. Tell me about 
what the school was like when you were there as a

02:41.944 --> 02:45.590
student in the early 30s. Well, A&M was a small 
military boys college. I guess we had about 3,000

02:50.939 --> 02:57.610
students during most of my time here.

02:59.648 --> 03:13.248
This was during the well-known depression, and 
times were pretty hard, and so the enrollment was a

02:59.648 --> 03:13.248
little smaller, I guess, than

02:59.648 --> 03:13.248
it had been. But it was the only kind of university, 
the only kind of college that I knew, so I can't

03:13.268 --> 03:21.761
compare it very much at that time with anything 
else. Why did you decide to go to A&M? because my

03:24.978 --> 03:27.601
brother went to A&M before me, I think. How did you 
have an interest in electrical engineering? How

03:30.585 --> 03:31.646
did this develop? Oh, this developed as a child, 
through the years as a child, and I was very, very

03:31.666 --> 03:43.101
certain of what I wanted to do and what I was 
interested in. Was electrical engineering a

03:43.121 --> 03:47.886
relatively new field when you entered it, or had it 
been around for a while? No, it wasn't a new field. I

03:50.370 --> 03:52.352
think electrical engineering The electrical 
engineering department at A&M began around 1910

03:53.075 --> 04:03.672
or 1911.

04:03.692 --> 04:11.124
So I would consider

04:03.692 --> 04:11.124
it a new field. Pretty well established. One of the 
newer engineering fields, of course, but pretty

04:13.047 --> 04:18.416
well established. How did the Depression affect 
you and your family?

04:25.340 --> 04:43.940
I think not a great deal

04:25.340 --> 04:43.940
because the depression started two or three years 
after my father's death.

04:43.960 --> 04:53.710
I think our situation didn't change as much during 
the depression as lots

04:43.960 --> 04:53.710
of other people. reasonably hard time, but the 
older kids in the family were working.

05:02.570 --> 05:05.094
And so that took care of the rest of us. Was there any 
resentment on their part of having to work to

05:05.114 --> 05:11.585
support the rest of the family? Probably.

05:15.892 --> 05:16.753
Not really. I don't think that's so...

05:24.757 --> 05:29.962
When did you get your master's degree? In 1946 or 
47. Where did you get it? At Enid. What did you do

05:38.271 --> 05:40.153
then after you got your bachelor's? After I got my 
bachelor's degree, I worked for the city of Mahea,

05:40.694 --> 05:47.260
a little town up north. MEXIA. MEXIA as city 
engineer. six or seven years. And just before

05:56.992 --> 06:05.363
World War II started, I went to work for the State 
Parks Board as an engineer. In Austin. In Austin.

06:07.566 --> 06:22.725
And then immediately after the start of World War 
II, someone here at the university, I think it was

06:07.566 --> 06:22.725
the head of the electrical engineering 
department at the university, invited me to come

06:23.380 --> 06:39.663
back here and teach in the Naval Training School, 
which was a training program for electronic

06:23.380 --> 06:39.663
technicians for the Navy. It was a pre-radar 
training program. operated by the university,

06:42.432 --> 06:46.838
operated by the college before the Navy. So I came 
back just very soon after the war started and began

06:46.858 --> 06:55.149
teaching in this Naval Training School. I spent 
the rest of the war here. And what about while you

06:56.331 --> 06:58.815
were in Maheo? How was Maheo affected by the 
Depression? Oh, it was hard hit. By the Depression

07:03.601 --> 07:10.190
and every other thing you can think of, Maheo had 
been a hog in the town. Beginning in 19... and this

07:13.567 --> 07:34.496
began to play out in the late 20s just in time for the 
depression to start and almost finish off the

07:13.567 --> 07:34.496
town. Does that town have a large number of Mexican 
Americans because of its name? No. It doesn't? No.

07:39.103 --> 07:40.625
That has nothing to do with it? Well, the name came 
from The person who received the land grant from

07:42.980 --> 07:56.436
the Mexican, from the Texas government, I guess, 
who was a Mexican in that area, General Mejia. The

07:56.456 --> 08:01.943
town was named after

07:56.456 --> 08:01.943
him. Okay. Tell me a little something about when 
you were with the State Parks Board in Austin.

08:07.629 --> 08:09.932
Well, I traveled most of the time. At that time, 
primarily we were involved in maintaining the

08:11.971 --> 08:28.952
state parks and kind of mothballing them for the 
period of war

08:11.971 --> 08:28.952
that was coming up. So, there wasn't much 
construction or planning or anything like that,

08:28.972 --> 08:37.523
but it was realized that travel was going to be 
curtailed, the parks were not going to be used very

08:39.612 --> 08:43.597
much. Some of the parks were built by the Civilian 
Conservation Corps, the CCC, and this was

08:43.617 --> 08:52.788
terminated. And so much of my job was finishing up 
what they had left undone and getting the parks

08:52.808 --> 09:05.263
ready to ride out the period of not very much use. 
Were any parks built during this time? None were

09:07.355 --> 09:09.658
built as far as I know. There were two or three parks 
under construction when the war started. Big Bend

09:14.505 --> 09:16.969
State Park was one. It was a state park at that time. 
It's a national park now, but it was...

09:18.551 --> 09:34.594
Yeah, the Big Bend Park was under construction by 
the CCC camp, and when the CCC camp shut down, They

09:35.030 --> 09:40.254
just walked off and left their tools and left 
everything half-finished. And it would have been

09:40.274 --> 09:48.041
subject to a considerable deterioration without 
some work done on it to protect it from the other

09:40.274 --> 09:48.041
ones. So I spent some time, I spent six weeks living 
down there in the Jesus Mountains at that time with

09:48.061 --> 09:56.568
my wife and my boy. When did you marry? Oh, in 1939.

10:02.433 --> 10:04.615
But that job didn't last very long. was the 
traveling became too much of a problem. So I was

10:09.701 --> 10:18.156
very glad to come here to A&M and interested in some 
kind of teaching. I just had a BS degree so it was

10:18.176 --> 10:26.711
equivalent to a technical institute type of 
program. What year did you come back to A&M? 1940. I

10:30.785 --> 10:36.371
believe the war started in 1941, December 1941, 
and I came back in 1942. You were here throughout

10:36.391 --> 10:38.753
the war? Yes. Okay. How was the school affected by 
World War II? Oh, the school. We didn't have any

10:44.959 --> 10:46.361
students. We didn't have any civilian students. 
Practically none. And the school was maintained

10:51.265 --> 10:58.212
by this Naval Training School, which was a pretty 
big operation. Two training schools. One for

11:00.620 --> 11:04.745
electronic technicians, that's the one I was 
involved in. The other was for radio operators,

11:04.765 --> 11:13.215
which was really

11:04.765 --> 11:13.215
just technical training. We had probably, I don't 
remember the numbers, but we had 2,500 sailors

11:13.235 --> 11:27.771
here all the time throughout until right at the end 
of the war in training. The Navy paid for their paid

11:30.775 --> 11:41.188
the costs of their training here and I'm sure that 
the university, well the university did profit

11:30.775 --> 11:41.188
from this. Well enough to pay the overhead and 
upkeep of the college and so forth here at this

11:41.208 --> 11:51.781
time. These programs were supervised and run by 
the electrical engineering department. I got my

11:57.826 --> 12:18.213
master's

11:57.826 --> 12:18.213
degree and left in 1946, I

11:57.826 --> 12:18.213
believe, to South Carolina. I taught at Clemson 
College in South Carolina. Clemson is a college,

12:25.552 --> 12:33.761
very much like any of the small boys military

12:25.552 --> 12:33.761
school. The nature of the college, just like any 
land grant college, taught the same programs, the

12:33.781 --> 12:49.899
same kind of school at that time. Not quite as 
large, but essentially the same. I was over there

12:51.300 --> 12:54.924
until 1950. In what capacity? Some level of 
instructor in the electrical engineering

12:56.483 --> 12:59.889
department. I guess I was an assistant professor. 
I think I was an assistant professor over there.

13:08.403 --> 13:12.069
Clemson was very similar to A&M in its outlook and 
procedures. Very similar. Why did you leave

13:13.912 --> 13:16.416
Clemson? get a Ph.D. a year. I came back the end of it 
and got a Ph.D. in electrical engineering. Were

13:25.510 --> 13:31.119
you one of those who were able to get a Ph.D. while 
they were teaching here? Well, no, I came back with

13:31.139 --> 13:46.082
a graduate assistantship

13:31.139 --> 13:46.082
and was a graduate assistant for a couple of years 
and was almost through with my Ph.D. And I believe I

13:48.712 --> 13:55.583
was offered a position on the faculty just before I 
got the degree. What year did you get the

13:55.603 --> 14:00.049
education? 53, I believe. What was the subject of 
your dissertation or service? It had to do with

14:02.733 --> 14:08.002
mass spectrometry.

14:09.143 --> 14:11.006
Would you spell that? 
M-A-S-S-P-E-C-T-R-O-N-E-T-R-Y.

14:15.473 --> 14:16.795
It's a subject. Then

14:18.867 --> 14:38.752
you became an associate professor of electrical

14:18.867 --> 14:38.752
engineering in 1953. I'm not quite sure of the 
title. You held that position until you became

14:39.754 --> 14:42.377
department head. Somewhere in between these 
times I was promoted to a professor. When did you

14:53.852 --> 14:55.634
become department head? In 1957. I believe it was 
1957. When you became department head,

14:57.337 --> 15:05.027
about how many faculty members were under your 
supervision? I think we had about 20. Was most of

15:05.548 --> 15:09.694
the emphasis on teaching or research or a mixture? 
Primarily teaching. When did research become an

15:11.703 --> 15:17.812
important aspect of academic work? Well, the 
emphasis was increased

15:17.832 --> 15:36.720
fairly steadily over this period from 19, I guess 
the middle 19, beginning of the 1950s. Emphasis

15:36.740 --> 15:39.043
was increasingly put on research.

15:43.107 --> 15:57.642
Well

15:43.107 --> 15:57.642
that's hard to say. Well that gave a big boost to the 
research effort, of course. I think emphasis was

16:09.354 --> 16:12.777
put on research because to

16:14.528 --> 16:36.396
do this

16:14.528 --> 16:36.396
for competitive reasons with other 
universities. What were some of the research

16:36.416 --> 16:38.258
endeavors that were undertaken when you were 
department head? program, a beginning,

16:38.440 --> 16:52.990
beginnings of a research program in radar, 
weather radar, in association with Oceanography

16:38.440 --> 16:52.990
Department and Meteorology Department.

16:56.092 --> 17:18.758
program in control systems and these were built 
around individuals of course individuals do

16:56.092 --> 17:18.758
research this was not something that the 
electrical engineering department did but we had

16:56.092 --> 17:18.758
individuals who were involved in researching 
control systems

16:56.092 --> 17:18.758
electromagnetic theory radiation and 
propagation

17:34.297 --> 17:48.560
network

17:34.297 --> 17:48.560
theory. These are things I remember right now. 
When you were department head in the late 50s,

17:49.361 --> 17:51.765
about how many students were there in the medical 
engineering department?

17:57.196 --> 18:04.566
Well, those figures could be looked up, and I don't 
really remember, but I expect it were four or five

17:57.196 --> 18:04.566
hundred. When you left as department head, do you 
remember how much it had increased? Yeah, it had

18:07.511 --> 18:08.532
grown some. Well, this four or five hundred is the 
kind of average figure that I remember. I guess it

18:13.579 --> 18:22.171
grew about fifty percent during the nine years 
that I was department head. You were department

18:22.412 --> 18:23.634
head from 57 to 66? Nine years, I believe.

18:27.807 --> 18:41.333
How are the students in the late 50s and early 60s in 
comparison with some of the earlier students that

18:27.807 --> 18:41.333
you had been, that you

18:27.807 --> 18:41.333
had encountered? Well, I think in the early, in the 
50s we were still getting veteran students from

18:41.353 --> 18:49.849
World War II who were very serious.

18:54.419 --> 18:56.421
dedicated students. That is, they knew what they 
wanted to do and they had goals

18:56.521 --> 19:06.052
and they stuck with those goals. About in the late 
50s, the nature of the students changed some

19:06.072 --> 19:20.207
because we got less of these veteran students and 
more youngsters just out of high school.

19:23.107 --> 19:39.712
And about that

19:23.107 --> 19:39.712
time,

19:23.107 --> 19:39.712
I think the quality of the high school students 
began to improve some. So there was a difference in

19:39.732 --> 19:40.673
maturity. This is about the only thing I can 
remember. They were younger and they did not have

19:41.595 --> 19:47.764
as well-defined

19:41.595 --> 19:47.764
goals in what they were.

19:51.372 --> 19:57.222
but I think we always got pretty capable students.

19:57.242 --> 20:04.955
I don't have much, I don't want to say anything that 
detracts from the capability of the students we

19:57.242 --> 20:04.955
had. While you were in the department, were there 
ever any women students in Electrical

20:04.975 --> 20:12.187
Engineering? Well, in the latter year, in the last 
year or two,

20:20.667 --> 20:22.149
We had one or two. They were just beginning. Most of 
the years, women weren't allowed to enroll in

20:24.971 --> 20:29.576
that. And I think we did have one or two women 
teachers, but women weren't

20:29.596 --> 20:43.430
allowed to enroll in it, too. Sometime, like the 
mid-60s, I've forgotten how to tell you for sure.

20:47.262 --> 20:48.604
We did have one or two. After you stepped down as 
department head in 1966 and stayed on until 1976

20:49.344 --> 20:59.316
when you retired.

20:59.336 --> 21:05.203
While you were in the department, were there any 
very many flags that drove an electable Indian

20:59.336 --> 21:05.203
hearing? Well, not any significant numbers, 
maybe one or two while I was department head. But

21:12.671 --> 21:17.016
after that time in the 70s, we had several. Not

21:19.527 --> 21:30.818
a big percentage,

21:19.527 --> 21:30.818
but we had several. Why do you think that there have 
been revenue blacks who have enrolled in any

21:30.838 --> 21:35.342
aspect of engineering? You don't really want me to 
answer that, do you? No, you don't. Well, let's

21:38.765 --> 21:42.689
strike that for the record. Okay, have electrical 
engineers always commanded the high salary

21:42.709 --> 21:47.053
levels that they do today? In a relative way, yeah. 
As long as I can remember, electrical engineers

21:52.000 --> 22:07.050
have had a

21:52.000 --> 22:07.050
little bit higher beginning salaries than 
average for engineering.

22:07.070 --> 22:08.974
And this goes back as far as I can remember. Have 
there ever been any years in which there were

22:09.140 --> 22:14.789
rather few jobs for electrical engineers? Oh, 
yeah, when I graduated in the 30s. Back in the 30s.

22:19.737 --> 22:26.587
Except for that, they've always had good 
selections.

22:26.607 --> 22:28.010
I believe that's correct.

22:31.034 --> 22:32.076
Probably. More than half the class when I 
graduated in those years did not go into the field

22:33.743 --> 22:43.315
of electrical

22:33.743 --> 22:43.315
engineering. Some field allied to electrical 
engineering maybe, but there weren't very many

22:43.335 --> 22:58.874
jobs in the engineering area in the 30's.

22:58.894 --> 23:02.839
Of course the war changed over there.

23:10.868 --> 23:14.713
Let's discuss the faculty when you were 
department head. Was there a feeling of

23:14.733 --> 23:20.301
camaraderie among the faculty members? Very 
much. It was a close-knit family. Do you think this

23:24.767 --> 23:26.349
has changed over the years? Yes, it's changed over 
the years. The department has gotten much bigger,

23:29.333 --> 23:35.982
a different kind of faculty, and it has changed 
very much.

23:42.256 --> 23:58.905
At the time I was department head, the faculty had 
not had any great growth, and most of us had worked

23:42.256 --> 23:58.905
together for

23:42.256 --> 23:58.905
a good many years. I had been here several years, 
was here as a student, and so we were close in that

23:58.925 --> 24:06.778
group.

24:10.673 --> 24:27.273
these faculty members under your program 
supervision, what

24:10.673 --> 24:27.273
were some of the schools that they had come from? 
Oh, that's hard for me to remember. We had a larger

24:30.176 --> 24:38.706
than would be desirable number of A&M graduates, 
but we had graduates from Cornell,

24:40.930 --> 24:49.719
Clemson in South Carolina.

24:49.960 --> 25:03.454
One of the universities

24:49.960 --> 25:03.454
in North Carolina,

24:49.960 --> 25:03.454
I've forgotten which one. Several who did 
undergraduate work. Now these are newer faculty

25:04.195 --> 25:06.077
members that joined the faculty in the 50s and the 
60s. who did undergraduate work here and then went

25:07.120 --> 25:26.710
to

25:07.120 --> 25:26.710
other

25:07.120 --> 25:26.710
universities for graduate study, Wisconsin, 
Illinois. Let's see, we had one of our faculty

25:26.730 --> 25:28.292
members from Purdue, University of Texas. A 
mixture of schools, many of them were schools in

25:28.312 --> 25:33.280
the South,

25:37.478 --> 25:45.926
You've seen a number of, since you've been at A&M, 
you've seen a number of different governors in

25:37.478 --> 25:45.926
Texas. Have there been any difference in some of 
these governors in regard to the degree of support

25:45.946 --> 25:52.572
they've given A&M? Well I couldn't answer that 
because I never was at a level in the university

25:52.592 --> 26:04.583
that had any dealings with the governor or the 
legislature. Yeah,

26:05.947 --> 26:31.718
I

26:05.947 --> 26:31.718
think we were, I think we were in the upper ranks of 
the electrical engineering departments in the

26:33.858 --> 26:41.925
south, not at the top of the upper ranks. What were 
some of the other students

26:41.945 --> 26:53.115
in

26:41.945 --> 26:53.115
those upper ranks? Well, I mentioned University 
of Texas, Georgia Tech, Rice.

27:00.042 --> 27:01.603
I can think of some more. And I feel like we were not 
quite at the level of those schools. Facilities

27:09.645 --> 27:23.826
and faculty and program,

27:09.645 --> 27:23.826
these kinds of

27:09.645 --> 27:23.826
things. And why did you step down as a department? 
Because of ill health. And you stayed on for 10 more

27:27.111 --> 27:30.897
years as a professor? Yeah. The ill health of the 
dean said I made him sick.

27:46.788 --> 27:54.499
While you were still in the department, as a 
professor, the Vietnam War was underway. Could

27:54.519 --> 27:58.665
you say how any of this affected Texas A&M? I don't 
think it had very much effect on Texas A&M.

28:09.860 --> 28:26.459
There was of course a reduction in students 
because of the large number involved in the war,

28:09.860 --> 28:26.459
but we didn't grow much and we didn't lose much 
during the Vietnam War. The biggest impact of the

28:26.479 --> 28:34.948
Vietnam War was dissension on campuses over the 
country and we had very little of that here. Why do

28:34.968 --> 28:36.710
you suppose that happened? It's the nature of the 
Vietnam War. and I think good administration of

28:40.083 --> 28:48.893
the university

28:40.083 --> 28:48.893
at that time. Were there any other universities in 
Texas that had any problems on campuses during the

28:48.913 --> 28:57.002
Vietnam War? As I remember, there were some 
demonstrations and some problems at other

28:57.022 --> 29:03.269
universities. But there weren't, to your 
knowledge, there weren't even any

29:03.289 --> 29:07.373
demonstrations that they had? I can't remember 
anything that I'd seriously consider a

29:10.087 --> 29:24.623
demonstration.

29:24.643 --> 29:34.553
How did the university change when you retired in 
1976 compared to when you became a full-time

29:24.643 --> 29:34.553
personnel and teaching back in 1953? During those 
23 years, what was something wrong? How had the

29:36.015 --> 29:38.237
university changed?

29:41.187 --> 29:56.602
Well, before I retired A&M had begun admitting 
women and had made ROTC optional, but not very long

29:41.187 --> 29:56.602
before. And these were just beginning to have an 
impact on the university when I retired. And over

30:03.369 --> 30:09.135
the next ten years they have a tremendous impact on 
the university. character of the university.

30:16.167 --> 30:19.451
What about the quality of students? By the early 
and mid seventies, how did they contrast with the

30:19.471 --> 30:26.578
previous quality of students? Well, I think the 
students were a better group of fellows,

30:26.598 --> 30:36.088
increasingly better as time went on. From the time 
I began to know something about their background

30:38.393 --> 30:41.960
and records. What do you think that is when the 
public has an image that the quality of students

30:41.980 --> 30:51.498
has steadily decreased over

30:41.980 --> 30:51.498
the years? Well perhaps there are two reasons for 
that. One is I think the public's perception might

30:53.441 --> 31:00.655
not be correct and the other is I think our higher 
the quality of students that came to A&M improved

31:01.563 --> 31:07.412
over the years relative to general development. 
In other words, many of these slower learners

31:07.432 --> 31:10.898
didn't come to A&M. I expect this is so.

31:16.707 --> 31:27.904
Well, I know that our admissions

31:16.707 --> 31:27.904
raised the quality of the students over this 
period. We got better.

31:32.714 --> 31:35.779
with better backgrounds. Increasingly as time 
went on, probably this is still increasing now.

31:41.568 --> 31:52.365
What were some of the research endeavors in 
mechanical engineering at the time you were

31:41.568 --> 31:52.365
retiring in the mid-seventies and running away at 
the time?

31:52.385 --> 31:58.975
I guess the biggest research effort was in 
semiconductor devices.

32:02.296 --> 32:19.164
general area of transistors and applications of 
these things that were beginning in the late,

32:02.296 --> 32:19.164
beginning with us in the Middle 60s and have 
continued on since

32:02.296 --> 32:19.164
then. We had started a research program funded 
principally by Texas Instruments in this area

32:29.887 --> 32:46.372
sort of in its beginning stages

32:29.887 --> 32:46.372
when I was replaced and has increased importantly 
since

32:29.887 --> 32:46.372
then. This has been a big thing, you know, the

32:46.392 --> 32:56.928
last 20 years. Have you remained professionally 
active since you retired in 1976? Not really. My

32:59.823 --> 33:05.031
interest has been a hobby interest since I 
retired. In what capacity? Oh, I'm a ham radio

33:06.053 --> 33:11.421
operator and I'm a computer buff. These are areas 
that I was interested in throughout my

33:11.522 --> 33:23.080
professional career as they came along. You've 
been retired for five years. What are some of the

33:28.194 --> 33:36.685
things you've done to keep busy besides these two 
particular hobbies? That keeps me busy.

33:42.032 --> 33:52.425
Those are pretty, those are hobbies that one can 
spend as much time as you want to and

33:42.032 --> 33:52.425
put it off when you need to.

33:59.611 --> 34:03.436
Do you have any regrets about your career at Texas 
A&M? I enjoyed it thoroughly. I think it's

34:04.718 --> 34:05.619
wonderful. Would you have done anything 
differently if you had it to do over?

34:12.930 --> 34:21.041
Well, if I could start it over again at 68 years old, 
I'd know some things to do differently. As I went

34:21.061 --> 34:24.245
along, I did the things that I thought were the 
right thing. I might still think they were the

34:24.806 --> 34:27.610
right thing.

34:37.900 --> 34:42.686
Do you ever run across any of your former students? 
Oh, yeah. Any place you go in the state, some of the

34:42.907 --> 34:48.194
other professors have said that no matter where 
they go, they run across the former students. Most

34:48.214 --> 34:57.446
places you go, you do, if you're there very long, 
you run across somebody.

34:57.466 --> 35:04.275
I run across more of them who just stop by 
occasionally, passing through here. Many of them

35:04.295 --> 35:06.017
do, some of them do.

35:10.925 --> 35:20.620
Do you think whether the student was smaller than 
the faculty members or more personal interest in

35:10.925 --> 35:20.620
the students than they have since they became a 
larger university?

35:20.640 --> 35:22.583
Well yes, I expect that's true. I think you would 
expect that. Certainly we knew our students

35:25.508 --> 35:32.619
better than we

35:25.508 --> 35:32.619
do now. What about your children? Did you have a 
son? We have one son, yes. Where does he live? He's

35:42.109 --> 35:43.130
in Phoenix, in the Phoenix area. In what capacity? 
He works for computer

35:43.511 --> 35:49.159
companies out there. And like lots of these 
people, he changes around from one to another. Is

35:54.788 --> 35:57.552
there anything else we need to touch on? Any 
observations you had about your career? Oh, I

36:02.242 --> 36:09.391
can't, you asked me if I'd enjoyed my time here at 
A&M, I think, and I have tremendously. I think it

36:09.411 --> 36:31.337
was a fine career, but I think I, I feel like I lived 
in the golden age of my career, and looking back at

36:09.411 --> 36:31.337
the things that have happened during, well, from 
the time I graduated college until now, you can't

36:09.411 --> 36:31.337
believe advances that have taken place, the 
rapidity with which these advances have taken

36:32.718 --> 36:45.592
place, and things that to me just seem absolutely 
wonderful. Starting with the development of,

36:45.612 --> 37:00.227
pretty much the development of radio 
communication in the 1930s, and the great strides

36:45.612 --> 37:00.227
that were made during World War II

37:05.253 --> 37:12.884
communications and electronic devices during 
that time, which later were applied to civilian

37:05.253 --> 37:12.884
use. Development of television

37:13.004 --> 37:22.098
in the 50s, primarily, and beginning in 1948. 
Announcement

37:22.579 --> 37:31.912
or discovery of the transistor by Bell 
Laboratories. This revolutionized the whole

37:31.932 --> 37:35.057
electrical industry.

37:38.125 --> 37:42.591
30

37:38.125 --> 37:42.591
years. Progress made strides

37:42.611 --> 37:52.404
that took us 50 years up until that time. All these 
things, all these things now since 1950 that

37:52.424 --> 38:02.918
depend

37:52.424 --> 38:02.918
on applications and offshoots of the transistor 
Absolutely new to us

38:04.197 --> 38:13.749
old guys, you know, school before that time. But I 
think it's been tremendous and exciting and fun to

38:13.769 --> 38:16.933
keep up with. And you can believe this because this 
is now my hobby after I retired from this career. I

38:24.243 --> 38:31.712
still find it fascinating and hard to believe. 
Thank you very much for taking the time to talk with

38:31.732 --> 38:32.854
me. You bet. Glad you came by.
