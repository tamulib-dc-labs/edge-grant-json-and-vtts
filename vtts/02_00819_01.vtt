WEBVTT

00:01.347 --> 00:13.321
Well,

00:01.347 --> 00:13.321
Jerry, you came by the house here to get a little 
information about the history of College

00:01.347 --> 00:13.321
Station. To begin with, I might add that my name is 
DA Andy Anderson, who at one time was, or I was,

00:13.401 --> 00:25.355
mayor of the city of College Station. Actually, my 
work as in the field of city government began in

00:32.110 --> 00:35.874
1957. Actually, I might go back just a little ways, 
though, first and mention that I came to this

00:36.534 --> 00:45.824
community in 1939.

00:48.006 --> 00:59.097
At that time, prior to that time, I was located in 
Luskin, working for the university at that point.

00:59.515 --> 01:01.958
with the Texas Forest Service. And in January of 
this year, I retired from the university after

01:03.160 --> 01:11.831
about 39 years of employment. Prior to that, I was 
affiliated with the US Forest Service and was

01:12.873 --> 01:24.628
involved during the acquisition phases of the 
National Forest in East Texas. And my work prior to

01:25.520 --> 01:36.076
that was with the old Bureau of Plant Industry in 
white pine blister rust control activities. Was

01:36.096 --> 01:37.618
that with the university? No. That was with the 
government? No, that was with the federal

01:39.561 --> 01:41.744
government. That was the Bureau of Plant 
Industry. It was an old division of the U.S.

01:44.168 --> 01:54.463
Department of Agriculture from Washington, D.C.

01:55.085 --> 02:05.401
Of course, my education, as far as my education is 
concerned, I got a bachelor of science degree at

01:55.085 --> 02:05.401
Pennsylvania State University. I subsequently 
received a master's degree at Texas A&M. And what

02:11.590 --> 02:14.294
year was that? The master's I got in 19, I think it 
was 45.

02:20.503 --> 02:22.126
I believe that was a year. I'm reminiscing here a 
little bit now. And I did a little work toward a

02:25.291 --> 02:37.784
doctorate degree, but decided that with the field 
activities that I had, I could not do justice to

02:25.291 --> 02:37.784
that degree program. At any rate, my interest in 
city government began in the 50s when there was

02:38.765 --> 02:53.340
quite a bit of violation of the deed restrictions 
in College Station. And I might add that when I

02:54.502 --> 03:04.254
first came here in 1939,

02:54.502 --> 03:04.254
Bryan and College Station were six miles apart. It 
was a two-lane road

03:06.237 --> 03:13.025
with country in between, you might say. Was that 
road the old College over here, College Road?

03:16.910 --> 03:19.574
Well, there was a College Road, but also Highway 6. 
I see. Highway 6 had gone through. Highway 6 had

03:21.616 --> 03:23.158
gone through. just before I got here, and of course 
I came right after the trolley gave up from Bryan to

03:23.678 --> 03:31.685
College Station. And this was a university 
community. Everyone, well at that time, most of

03:35.088 --> 03:46.498
the faculty and staff were on campus, or quite a few 
of them were on campus, in residences on the

03:35.088 --> 03:46.498
campus. Many, of course, had migrated to the 
periphery of the area, the campus per se, And this

03:55.150 --> 04:12.383
house right here, where you're taping this, where 
I live, was one of the few that was in this whole area

03:55.150 --> 04:12.383
that we today call College Hills State, or the 
College Hills proper.

04:15.181 --> 04:19.006
Where most of the faculty, you said, lived on the 
campus. Now, did they move off over to this area as a

04:19.046 --> 04:22.191
group? Most of them, or did they move off at 
separate times? Was there a general move off?

04:26.396 --> 04:28.720
Well, there was a general move here, Jerry. They 
wanted to, well, they had requested that as fast as

04:30.642 --> 04:42.218
possible, those on the campus move from their 
residences. many of these people began to build

04:42.772 --> 04:51.485
their own homes, such as in the South Side and the 
East Gate here. So gradually, then, people began

04:52.447 --> 05:00.038
to build their homes and move into them and get off 
the campus. About what year was this? Was it 1940?

05:02.402 --> 05:05.927
That was around 1939, 1940.

05:06.835 --> 05:13.083
And gradually the area became built up with a few 
more homes going in. And with the building of these

05:14.404 --> 05:27.240
homes, the individuals, the real estate people 
that were selling the lots, of course gave us some

05:14.404 --> 05:27.240
restrictions. In other words, the homes were to be 
one family dwellings and The sides on both

05:33.380 --> 05:39.047
residences were to be at least a minimum of 10 feet. 
Was it kind of like a certain zoning? It was like a

05:40.990 --> 05:42.532
type of zoning. That is right. But then as more 
interest, or there was greater interest in terms

05:43.954 --> 06:02.138
of

05:43.954 --> 06:02.138
home building, why those in charge of the railers 
and so on selling these lots became a little bit

05:43.954 --> 06:02.138
careless. And as a result, there were a lot of 
violations. And these violations led to

06:06.387 --> 06:12.184
criticisms on the part of the public. And I just 
happened to be one that they came to. It was my job to

06:17.187 --> 06:28.338
appeal to the council at that time as to these 
violations that were going on and appealing to the

06:17.187 --> 06:28.338
city to help us do something about it. Well, how did 
you get, why were you sort of the one singled out to

06:28.558 --> 06:32.462
people? Why did people come to you? Well, I guess 
maybe I was one that didn't fear to go to the council

06:34.224 --> 06:41.631
and raise cane and see that action was done. And 
this ultimately led, of course, to my election

06:42.932 --> 06:47.076
then. to the city council. The people over here in 
College Hill said, well, we need a representation

06:49.064 --> 06:57.093
at the council table who will represent us, the 
people. And as a consequence, then, I went in in

06:58.195 --> 07:03.241
1957.

07:05.043 --> 07:12.692
And until it was necessary for me to get out in June 
of 1971, I almost had, you might say, 14 years of

07:13.263 --> 07:18.991
continuous service to the city. Well, now before 
that time, you got into the council. When did

07:23.357 --> 07:28.164
College Station incorporate as a town or city 
separately from Bryan? That was in 1938. I see.

07:30.207 --> 07:30.447
Yeah.

07:33.431 --> 07:34.753
What were the reasons that they did that? Were they 
afraid that Bryan was going to try to move their

07:34.773 --> 07:38.258
city? No, we were unincorporated at that time, 
Jerry. Okay. And this is where a lot of the hard

07:41.832 --> 07:46.679
feelings arose that persist to this day. Even the 
student body is unaware of the problems they had

07:47.460 --> 07:55.391
with the city of Bryan, I mean, in the past. But we 
were an unincorporated city, you might say, made

07:55.411 --> 08:04.244
up primarily of students, faculty, and staff. In 
that day, of course, there were no cars on campus,

08:05.085 --> 08:08.530
as you find today. And it was mainly, it was the 
core. Well, just what exactly was the school like?

08:13.769 --> 08:16.192
How large was it at that time? Were there a

08:16.552 --> 08:31.029
lot of buildings that are now on campus still 
there? So let's go back to about when they were just

08:31.049 --> 08:40.560
talking about the incorporation of College 
Station and the reason why they had to do it,

08:31.049 --> 08:40.560
because Brian was trying to stretch there. Yes. 
Well, as I said before the interruption on the

08:41.223 --> 08:49.251
tape, Jerry, we were an unincorporated city. 
Bryan was incorporated. And one night, while at a

08:52.334 --> 09:06.328
special council meeting in Bryan, they decided to 
extend their boundary outward toward the city of

08:52.334 --> 09:06.328
College Station, or unincorporated city. And as I 
said earlier, before the break, much of that area

09:06.983 --> 09:19.840
that is now in Brine, out here at Rosemary, was at 
one time a part of our College Station community.

09:20.761 --> 09:30.414
This, of course, created a lot of blood between the 
people, the business people, and other people in

09:20.761 --> 09:30.414
Brine and College Station. As a matter of fact, 
this bad blood even existed among the student body

09:35.823 --> 09:44.039
a few years later when they banned everything in 
the city of Bryan. They had sort of a revolt with the

09:44.159 --> 09:51.212
people down there with the treatment they were 
receiving. But at any rate, It became necessary

09:53.187 --> 10:00.595
for us then to meet and take immediate steps to 
incorporate our city. Now this was before the days

10:01.316 --> 10:09.445
of zoning, which we now have by legislation. And 
they could extend their boundary out as far as they

10:09.465 --> 10:13.209
wanted to. Subsequent to that, then after we 
became incorporated, I was on the council. We also

10:21.018 --> 10:22.620
received wind. that they had intended to further 
extend their boundary to include the present

10:23.326 --> 10:30.816
airport. So we immediately met... What was this 
airport? Is this Easterwood? Easterwood. And we

10:38.025 --> 10:51.342
immediately met then and incorporated all the 
lands of Texas A&M University within the

10:38.025 --> 10:51.342
jurisdiction of our boundary so that today All of 
the area encompassed within the city is

10:51.997 --> 11:00.284
represented by university lands. I see. Now, 
today we have the protection of zoning in terms of

11:01.585 --> 11:08.651
extraterritorial rights and extending out. 
Brine can't exceed us in extending their

11:09.612 --> 11:12.815
territory. We can only go one mile as a city. But be 
that as it may, we have stabilized our boundary

11:16.538 --> 11:21.362
with brine. Unfortunately, part of what is brine 
should have been part of College Station had the

11:22.608 --> 11:31.099
ordinances existing today been in vogue at that 
time. Now, you said the lands incorporated by the

11:34.839 --> 11:42.187
university lands, owned lands, were 
incorporated into the College Station City area?

11:42.267 --> 11:42.728
That's right. As part of the city. Now, does that 
include the lands going out toward the Brazos

11:43.869 --> 11:47.653
where the extension formed? No, no. That just 
includes these lands here in town? Yeah, in the

11:50.076 --> 11:51.017
immediate area. That's right. And Easterwood. 
And Easterwood, yeah. And we did that, of course,

11:54.180 --> 12:00.867
for our own protection because the city of Bryan at 
that time could just keep on going. surround us and

12:01.252 --> 12:20.162
of course we wanted in defense we had to prepare a 
buffer and the community as a whole and the student

12:01.252 --> 12:20.162
body all was behind us in our record because of the 
feeling that existed at that time. Well in talking

12:20.443 --> 12:28.035
about the student body I was just curious to how 
much effect or pressure did they have really on the

12:28.370 --> 12:39.104
College Station City Councilman or the 
government in helping them or... Well, it was more

12:28.370 --> 12:39.104
in terms of attitude, Jerry, as to what we were 
doing. The people of Bryan at one time, some of

12:40.686 --> 12:45.352
these students say, were gouging them. They 
welcomed them to get what they could out of them.

12:48.256 --> 12:52.521
But beyond that, they just didn't want to have 
anything to do with it. And this created hard

12:52.542 --> 12:56.567
feelings on the part of the student body. And... 
Well, at the time of College Station becoming

12:58.846 --> 13:12.600
incorporated, the students at the university, 
were they, I guess they were for the incorporation

12:58.846 --> 13:12.600
of the city at this time? Well, I would dare say they 
were. Now, all of the faculty and staff were. And

13:17.525 --> 13:25.553
the student body was to the extent that they didn't 
have much feeling for Brian. Of course, you can go

13:26.814 --> 13:28.836
back. In that early period, though, of course, 
A&M, for example, had various facilities on

13:29.980 --> 13:42.539
campus for students and faculty and staff. For 
example, we had a hardware store over just across

13:42.599 --> 13:50.230
from where the President Exchange Store is. And we 
could go in there and get anything. We bought our

13:52.253 --> 13:54.216
milk and butter. in our fruit and everything from 
the old F&B. I recall paying $0.09 to $0.10 for a

13:59.323 --> 14:02.866
quart of milk. It was unpasteurized, but it was 
high quality milk. And of course, here again, the

14:08.032 --> 14:15.179
folks in Brine resented us getting anything of 
this nature from the university. Well, what's the

14:15.199 --> 14:17.001
old F&B? What was that? Well, let's see. I forgot 
what F&B was. That's just what everybody called

14:22.715 --> 14:24.117
it. Well, it was a name to it. It was across the 
track, and it was a dairy. Well, now, was that

14:30.264 --> 14:32.186
university-owned also? Yes. And all the stores, 
they liked to buy a few groceries of that sort. They

14:36.752 --> 14:40.456
were all located either on campus or... Well, most 
of them were off campus. Off campus. Like, I recall

14:41.898 --> 14:52.030
Luke Patronella had a grocery store at the East 
Gate, and he was a well-respected man in the

14:41.898 --> 14:52.030
community, and... Every year had Easter egg hunts 
for all the kids in the community. Well, now, what

14:58.081 --> 15:01.826
about over at Northgate now? Was that an area the 
same as it is now? Has it always been sort of...

15:07.532 --> 15:09.355
Somewhat similar to what it is now. That is right. 
There were just a few businesses up and down the

15:11.157 --> 15:14.240
drag there. Now, of course, you have more today 
than you did at that time. But essentially, it

15:18.065 --> 15:20.768
remained... the same. I mean, there was a grocery 
store and a few photographic shops, things of this

15:22.445 --> 15:27.015
nature. Well, was Lupo there at that time or not? 
Lupo has been around, yeah. He was there. He wasn't

15:32.888 --> 15:34.411
in that location. He was further east on 
University Drive. But Lupo was there when I can

15:41.808 --> 15:44.931
remember him very fondly. Well, how far now to the 
south did the College Station city boundaries go

15:44.951 --> 15:54.759
when y'all incorporated, to say toward Navasota 
that way? Well, Jerry, they didn't go very far

15:55.560 --> 16:01.565
south out of the city at that time. As a matter of 
fact, they didn't go very much beyond the south

16:01.585 --> 16:11.713
gate, just a peripheral area where the people were 
building. So there wasn't any buildings going on

16:11.980 --> 16:16.604
then over that part of the... No, no. At that time. 
This came subsequent to this with the growth in the

16:17.725 --> 16:25.071
university. You know, right down here we used to 
have, at the Eastgate, we used to have the old... I

16:30.236 --> 16:34.940
know the old-time Aggies will remember the blue 
tops. These were a series of cottages that were

16:34.960 --> 16:38.363
down there. Any visitors to College Station... 
you know, the parents and so on would stay in these

16:41.984 --> 16:47.071
old blue top courts down there. And they have long 
since disappeared and their place taken by the lot

16:48.032 --> 16:57.525
down there and everything else. Well, around 1940 
or so, 1939, how large was the university at that

16:58.266 --> 17:04.875
time, the student body? It was around 5,000, I 
believe. I reckon it would be there. During the

17:11.549 --> 17:19.720
war, what kind of effect did, say, the war have on 
the growth and the economy of this area? Do you

17:20.301 --> 17:20.821
remember? Yes.

17:27.330 --> 17:30.835
It had an effect. Of course, the student body, of 
course, we had Brian Field come in. That helped

17:37.023 --> 17:40.948
very much the economy of the area. And actually 
that was the first base also after they left for

17:41.182 --> 17:55.283
transportation by plane into the Bryan and 
College Station area. But the student body

17:55.303 --> 18:01.171
increased some because of the war effort. Of 
course it had other, I don't think the, in terms of

18:02.333 --> 18:09.383
growth in the community, I don't think there was 
much much effect at all, right? No, except for

18:11.052 --> 18:15.557
homes of those out in Bryan Field, and most of them 
lived in Bryan. Some lived in this area. I know

18:19.382 --> 18:25.329
during that period, I was on two assignments for 
the Army and Navy. One had to do, as a university

18:26.811 --> 18:37.885
employee, I was charged to look for Waiuli in the 
Trans-Pecos region. They were running short of

18:38.658 --> 18:41.722
rubber. And the Waiuli, of course, produces 
natural rubber. And I spent three months on that

18:46.208 --> 18:48.691
assignment. And following that, then the Navy put 
me out on a special assignment, confidential in

18:50.273 --> 18:59.585
nature. They were running short of hemp rope. And I 
had to go out to check the Trans-Pacific or the

19:06.198 --> 19:17.535
western part of the state in terms of yucca to see 
how much rope could be made from the yucca if it were

19:06.198 --> 19:17.535
utilized. Of course, this took me all down into old 
Mexico, and I went down through that country. I've

19:24.605 --> 19:27.930
been all through that. I know that country pretty 
intimately, or at least I did. I was down there on at

19:33.215 --> 19:37.009
least two assignments during the war. Of course, 
they were short, but very interesting trips.

19:43.289 --> 19:48.697
Well, who was the mayor of College Station when it 
first became corporate? When was their mayor?

19:51.261 --> 19:52.503
Let's see. Frank Anderson was the mayor. He was 
then succeeded by Ernest Lankford, who served

19:56.429 --> 20:04.161
most of the time as mayor. Well, he served up until 
the time that I took over in 1957. And I served six

20:11.369 --> 20:18.937
years as councilman under him before I ran for 
mayor. And at the time, I was petitioned by a large

20:18.957 --> 20:27.646
number of citizens to run, and I did. And I served 
almost six years until the suit was brought

20:27.686 --> 20:33.873
against me. And I know it was primarily against me 
an individual at the East Gate whom we all know as AP

20:39.533 --> 20:45.742
Boyette. He and some other individuals filed suit 
against the city of College Station. Well, not the

20:54.355 --> 20:55.376
city. Well, yes, it included the city, but 
primarily included us as individuals, saying

20:55.396 --> 21:07.093
that even though we did not receive any salary, no 
remuneration whatever, that it was illegal for us

21:07.968 --> 21:20.159
to serve as an officer of the city while we were a 
member of the university. And of course, this went

21:21.300 --> 21:22.841
to court. It went to several courts, as a matter of 
fact. And then finally, it was decided in one

21:27.005 --> 21:33.892
district court that that was the law of the land. It 
was subsequently taken to a three manned judge

21:38.815 --> 21:41.638
panel in Houston. But before they could act, the 
Supreme Court turned that action down. That

21:48.546 --> 22:01.240
necessitated then the development of an 
amendment to the state constitution that would

21:48.546 --> 22:01.240
allow us to continue to serve. And I took the 
leadership in this. It was called Amendment 12.

22:07.030 --> 22:24.634
And all my correspondence, legal papers, things 
of this nature, now repose in the library,

22:07.030 --> 22:24.634
permanent part of the library, so that in the 
future, The history of this can be eternal. Well,

22:28.020 --> 22:30.262
at what time now was this action going on? You said 
you served six years as mayor starting in 1957?

22:35.928 --> 22:39.812
Well, starting in 57, I served six years on the city 
council. I see. And then I decided to get out, and

22:40.633 --> 22:47.060
when I did get out, they asked me to go back and serve 
on planning and zoning. And then following my

22:48.181 --> 22:54.267
tenure on that, they decided that the best thing to 
do was run for mayor. And then I ran for mayor after

22:54.955 --> 23:03.182
that and was mayor from 66 through June 28 in 1971. 
When, following the holding up of four paychecks,

23:03.262 --> 23:12.390
it was decided that principal had gone far enough. 
I just couldn't live without the salary. Right. I

23:18.776 --> 23:19.376
see. But I am very pleased with the... period of my 
tenure and those on the council. We had an

23:28.501 --> 23:34.226
excellent council at the time of my retirement and 
even before that. Of course we had a lot of problems

23:35.287 --> 23:45.076
when I first went on the city council because it was 
dominated by AP Boyette primarily and his group.

23:45.096 --> 23:51.642
They were in the majority and I was trying to get 
development in the city. in cooperation with the

23:52.651 --> 23:55.174
university.

23:58.597 --> 24:04.784
What we see today is a result of action that we had 
earlier taken. But we had a council jury made up,

24:05.365 --> 24:11.311
for example, of the system dean of engineering. We 
had one from sociology department. We had one from

24:14.034 --> 24:16.176
planning department. We had a cross-section of 
individuals on the council that was really

24:16.757 --> 24:21.342
working on behalf of the city. And what we were 
doing, of course, was in favor of the university in

24:24.466 --> 24:35.839
the sense that we had a coordinated approach in 
terms of development. Well, what kind of

24:35.859 --> 24:42.907
development was the council, when you were on it or 
when you were mayor at the time, trying to go

24:35.859 --> 24:42.907
toward? What were they looking for? Well, when I 
went in as mayor, We had a few streetlights in the

24:50.971 --> 24:55.916
city of College Station. What now is Jersey Street 
was just Tar Bay Street for two vehicles. We did not

25:05.747 --> 25:10.052
have what we now know as University Drive. There 
were no, well the city had been small. Our staff was

25:17.161 --> 25:18.643
small. We needed to expand the staff. We needed to 
improve the services in terms of fire codes,

25:20.705 --> 25:28.012
building codes. We had no fire station. The 
university provided the firefighting for the

25:31.116 --> 25:39.645
city of College Station.

25:40.906 --> 25:44.890
Our water, of course, came primarily at first from 
the university. and then subsequently from

25:45.697 --> 25:47.739
Brine. We have tie-ins, of course, with the 
university. But in that period, it was one, or had

25:51.544 --> 25:57.250
to be one, of growth. And the extension of the 
Highway 6 towards the south was undertaken even

25:58.632 --> 26:10.285
before the council on which I served went on. We had 
University, or I mean Jersey Drive, I was

26:14.435 --> 26:24.170
criticized to some extent for, at that time, well, 
they figured, well, we only needed two slabs, you

26:14.435 --> 26:24.170
know, for two cars. But it appears now that our 
foresight was justified when you consider the

26:24.270 --> 26:32.523
traffic that is over there. That's true. And the 
same thing was said with University Drive,

26:33.885 --> 26:39.193
extending it out to the Interpass. We did fight 
very hard to get the east bypass. I was going to ask

26:44.209 --> 26:45.270
about that. I was wondering when did that come 
into, when did that idea pop up? Was that organized

26:50.636 --> 26:53.338
mostly by the state then? Is that a state highway? 
No, that was Brazos Area Planning Corporation, on

26:55.220 --> 27:01.046
which I served as member. And we had a plan 
developed for Bryan and College Station way back

27:01.887 --> 27:09.214
in, That was about 49,

27:09.869 --> 27:16.318
as I recall. And this was the guiding light for the 
two cities in terms of plans. And that was the first

27:23.707 --> 27:30.156
time that the possibility of a bypass came up, 
looking toward the future. Now, in that period

27:30.980 --> 27:37.969
even, Highway 6 did not have the travel, you know, 
traffic that it does today. But we as a council, of

27:39.010 --> 27:47.442
course, pushed this, recognizing the need down 
the road. And I think we have been justified in our

27:48.062 --> 27:53.950
vision to this extent. And of course, we were beset 
with problems. We were a city on a pay-as-you-go

27:57.567 --> 28:00.591
basis. I think we had one of the best road 
construction programs. We had no pay streets in

28:06.698 --> 28:10.442
the city of College Station. And we decided to set 
aside a certain amount of money annually for curb

28:10.462 --> 28:19.052
and gutter pavement. And that was set up on a ratio 
whereby people could petition and get streets in.

28:25.115 --> 28:30.624
But we did not do any more in a given year than our 
finances permitted. And this way, we just kept

28:30.644 --> 28:33.569
growing year after year. That is, in the old part of 
the city, in order to do this. And then, of course,

28:39.259 --> 28:46.110
we went ahead with our street light program, at 
least on major intersections. And these green,

28:46.968 --> 28:54.859
well, years ago, we started out with little corner 
stops with a street name written on them. You've

28:54.879 --> 28:57.163
seen some still in parts of the city. And if you 
drive around in the daytime or at night, you do not

28:57.824 --> 29:03.772
know what the name of the street is. So we have these 
green signs prepared for street designations.

29:11.824 --> 29:14.528
Now, we had our park areas. We had one like up here in 
College Hill that sat dormant for years. To this

29:21.746 --> 29:31.920
end, for example, I instituted a planning program 
down at our cemetery where we grew trees and out

29:21.746 --> 29:31.920
planted them in the park areas. Many of the trees 
that you see today are a result of this particular

29:32.501 --> 29:39.531
action. And I was one that very much believed in 
community participation. And toward this end, I

29:45.575 --> 30:05.912
had many committees in the city, even a cemetery 
committee, one that would take care of the

29:45.575 --> 30:05.912
cemetery and, you know, see that the rules and 
regulations were upheld and highway

29:45.575 --> 30:05.912
improvements. Just any number of city 
committees. Well, what kind of regulations and

30:10.424 --> 30:15.810
rules did you have to go along with on the cemetery 
committee? What type of things did they have to do?

30:17.392 --> 30:27.224
Well, what we were trying to avoid, Jerry, was the 
idea to regulate the size of a monument and even the

30:17.392 --> 30:27.224
planting of trees. Now, I realize that people do 
not realize that there are some, at the time at

30:27.304 --> 30:34.212
least, tend to plant trees that are not conducive 
to a cemetery create problems in terms of growth,

30:35.086 --> 30:47.945
not only from the top and leaf litter, but from the 
extension of roots. And many of the trees in an old

30:49.006 --> 30:58.600
cemetery utilize this area, why the roots are 
broken and the trees finally succumb. And we were

30:59.562 --> 31:03.287
trying to maintain a pretty place and regulate the 
outplanting of shrubs and flowers and things that

31:03.740 --> 31:12.712
would not fit into the overall scheme. And we 
didn't want one to put out a massive stone and

31:12.852 --> 31:18.399
another one would be a small one. Regulations of 
this type. I see.

31:25.909 --> 31:27.210
I think we're about out of tape here. I'll switch it 
over. All right.
