WEBVTT

00:02.731 --> 00:05.214
It was Alan Shivers, as I recall, at the time. And

00:07.236 --> 00:18.888
then, of course, any time we had two or three 
generals come to the campus, we acted as the honor

00:07.236 --> 00:18.888
guard for. And there was no malarkey, no pranks or 
jokes. No. About RVs. No. And as far as you know, the

00:28.037 --> 00:30.460
selection always was on the basis of quality. I 
assume because I didn't have any friends. I mean

00:36.523 --> 00:42.208
anybody that, you know, I don't know how they 
picked them. During your years at A&M, who were the

00:42.388 --> 00:48.914
notable campus administrators? Well, let's see. 
We had, you remember the freshmen were under the

00:51.716 --> 00:57.181
basic division and it was, the dean was Bertram. 
Was that who it was? I'm not sure. It was the dean of

01:01.034 --> 01:03.537
the basic division. I think it was Bertram or 
Bertrand. Of course, we had two presidents,

01:06.399 --> 01:09.262
Harrington and Morgan. Morgan came in my junior 
year.

01:17.271 --> 01:17.931
Eide Trotter. Eide P. Trotter. Abbott. John Paul 
Abbott. Bolton. Bear Tracks Bolton.

01:30.920 --> 01:31.922
Was Pinky Downs? Oh, he and his daughter are still 
there, all over the campus, yeah. What did you all

01:36.209 --> 01:37.251
think of Pinky? I just thought he was a nice guy. I 
wondered why he was spending his life doing what he

01:41.258 --> 01:46.046
was doing there. He didn't do anything that I know 
of. I don't know what he did. He was the official

01:49.151 --> 01:50.653
greeter. That's what I said. And apparently, I'm 
putting two and two together and getting 4,000. He

01:57.307 --> 02:11.450
had been on the board of directors back in the 20s as 
a young man and then during the Depression or soon

01:57.307 --> 02:11.450
thereafter his bank went broke and apparently 
this was to give him something to do. Is that what it

02:11.470 --> 02:13.193
was? Yeah. Like we never saw him sad. He was always 
upbeat and positive. And he was all over the

02:20.617 --> 02:23.981
campus, you know. Who were the, as you look back, 
who were your closest buddies? They were always

02:30.990 --> 02:38.540
people in my outfit, people from here that stayed. 
Aggie friendships last, don't they? Oh, yeah.

02:41.304 --> 02:41.584
Why? I don't know, but I mean, you just build a 
relationship with them. And in your major, were

02:48.258 --> 02:54.670
there some teachers that were really, as you 
looked? Oh, I had some magnificent professors.

02:59.419 --> 03:01.542
You know, they were more than just professors. 
They were interested in you. I had, as I said, what

03:03.246 --> 03:05.590
was his name? Was it Norman Rose? Mm-hmm. 
Dillingham, Hallmark. I didn't know him. Hughes,

03:16.800 --> 03:20.545
who was head of the department at the time, I didn't 
know him that well.

03:24.291 --> 03:32.883
Mike, what was his name,

03:24.291 --> 03:32.883
Albert Drews, great guy. What were some of the 
courses that were for you later you realized were

03:33.324 --> 03:38.852
important?

03:41.920 --> 03:57.422
Oh,

03:41.920 --> 03:57.422
I think the courses that I had my senior year and in 
graduate school

03:41.920 --> 03:57.422
were probably very important. I think the basic 
courses that I took probably in my sophomore year,

03:58.524 --> 04:08.738
freshman, sophomore year, and then the graduate 
school courses, is it look in hindsight is there

04:09.460 --> 04:31.958
anything that a m didn't do or is there any area of 
your uh profession that maybe didn't get enough

04:09.460 --> 04:31.958
attention well i don't think i think a m gave me for 
what i did i think texas a m one instilled in me as i

04:09.460 --> 04:31.958
said the ability to pursue to keep at it never give 
up I think to be I think to work hard I studied harder

04:33.946 --> 05:01.033
than I'd ever studied in my life and I think that 
that in itself now I know there was a lot of students

04:33.946 --> 05:01.033
down there a lot of my friends that took other 
degrees that didn't work too hard I don't know how

04:33.946 --> 05:01.033
it worked out for them And the emphasis always was 
on the real world, wasn't it? That's right. Not the

05:07.936 --> 05:09.397
theoretical, but the real. Texas A&M represented

05:09.858 --> 05:29.620
to me the opportunity for relatively

05:09.858 --> 05:29.620
modest people to achieve a goal and a dream that I 
don't think we could have gotten anywhere.

05:32.452 --> 05:37.699
In terms of building that spirit, we mentioned 
Silver Taps. Muster, do you remember Aggie Muster

05:38.360 --> 05:41.764
when you were? Where was it held? Let's see.

05:49.875 --> 05:51.818
Sometimes I know MSC Steps. That's where it was, 
MSC Steps, early on. Since you graduated, have you

05:57.906 --> 06:00.990
gone to Muster's? No. I mean, I've gone to musters 
here. That's what I mean. No, no. Yeah, yeah. Okay.

06:07.768 --> 06:09.130
I'm going to do the one this spring. That's what you 
told me you were going to do. I'm looking forward to

06:10.291 --> 06:11.392
it. I don't know anybody else that does anything 
like that. I don't think so. In the world. I think

06:16.678 --> 06:24.065
A&M probably at least makes a big attempt to stay 
closer to its students. It's kind of ironic. I kind

06:26.948 --> 06:29.391
of irritated Diana.

06:31.632 --> 06:39.140
You may have probably never heard this story, but 
when I was in office, their athletic budget was in

06:31.632 --> 06:39.140
huge trouble. She had borrowed, I think, several 
million dollars out of the student activity and

06:41.142 --> 06:53.174
the state auditor that was on their way out. So she 
and some of my friends who had graduated, Bob Hoy

06:54.195 --> 07:00.441
and those, came down to see me and We would like for 
the city to

07:00.961 --> 07:18.385
give us, and I may be wrong about the number, it was a 
sizable number, out of some funds we had, a grant in

07:00.961 --> 07:18.385
effect to cover the shortage. And I thought about 
it. for a while and then in the end I talked to the

07:23.000 --> 07:31.808
council about it and they weren't too interested 
because legally we couldn't do it. And she was

07:33.750 --> 07:45.621
pretty upset about it, but at the time I told her, I 
said, you know Diana,

07:33.750 --> 07:45.621
do you have a list of your ex-students? She said no. 
I said do you ever ask them for money? No. I said, you

07:55.062 --> 08:04.262
know I think it's a little bit improper to come to 
ask the citizens of this city when you're not even

07:55.062 --> 08:04.262
asking your own graduates for money. Now, as far as 
I know, that is a unique reality for A&M. These

08:13.937 --> 08:24.833
events that join it together, including Muster, 
and then for you commencement. Who came to

08:24.853 --> 08:26.976
commencement when you got your degree? Well, when 
I graduated the first time, my parents came and a

08:27.547 --> 08:36.542
number of my aunts and uncles from the family, part 
of the family in San Antonio. How did you feel

08:36.903 --> 08:38.746
walking across that stage? Oh, I think, I mean, you 
know, I've made it. I have not let my family down.

08:47.101 --> 08:50.787
And was it special to hear your name called? and 
your hand shaking. That's right. Not get it in the

08:54.484 --> 08:55.365
mail. That's right, that's right. It was there in 
your hand. Commencement in your day was held in G.

09:01.872 --> 09:06.037
Raleigh? Yes, it was. They had just built G. 
Raleigh. Big. Big, big. Before then, I guess, I

09:14.227 --> 09:16.690
don't know where it was held, in Guyon? I think so. 
And what we couldn't think of the other day was P.L.

09:22.888 --> 09:23.308
Downs. Was it the Downs? No, that's an auditorium. 
No, the Downs, not an auditorium, was a swimming

09:26.151 --> 09:28.894
deal. Yeah, yeah, that's not the old. No, it's not 
the old basketball game. Well, did you feel that

09:34.360 --> 09:42.829
you were, when you graduated, you feel reasonably 
well prepared to be a real engineer? I thought I

09:42.910 --> 09:44.434
could lick the world. And you stayed on to do a 
graduate degree. Why? I thought that I really

09:51.632 --> 09:59.552
wanted to get a little more specialization. The 
electrical engineering department in those days

10:00.292 --> 10:13.388
gave you a pretty broad background, both power and 
electronics, as they called it. At the time I

10:16.031 --> 10:25.202
graduated the first time, I was prepared to go to 
GE, which I, by the way, did when I graduated. and

10:26.077 --> 10:28.981
reported to building one steam turbine. But I knew 
from day one I didn't want to be a power engineer.

10:33.348 --> 10:35.271
But my dad wanted me to do that. And I was only there 
three months until I had to report to the Air Force.

10:39.938 --> 10:40.839
And I never went back.

10:44.164 --> 10:48.190
So I decided the best thing I'd do is get a master's 
degree. You did a thesis and you did a project in

10:48.210 --> 10:53.097
those days.

10:54.764 --> 10:56.927
And that's what I wanted to do. By the time you 
finished that master's degree, were you planning

10:56.947 --> 11:03.378
on being a self-employed engineer? You know, the 
day I finished there, I wasn't sure exactly what I

11:04.459 --> 11:13.273
wanted to do. I just knew that I

11:13.333 --> 11:20.485
was going to be self-employed. I didn't think I was 
going to be working for somebody. We've

11:24.667 --> 11:29.675
already asked this in a different way. What 
creates Aggie spirit, and why are Aggies so loyal?

11:35.264 --> 11:48.244
Well, I think it's the way they are indoctrinated,

11:35.264 --> 11:48.244
the way they relate

11:35.264 --> 11:48.244
to each other for the four or five years they're 
there. the the system the program at a m everything

11:50.013 --> 12:11.076
you do builds loyalty comradeship integrity hard 
work i think it's those things all put together If

12:11.512 --> 12:22.108
you were to go to City College in New York, right, 
you would not see your classmates except in class,

12:11.512 --> 12:22.108
and then you'd go home and you'd never see them 
again. You could go to the University of Texas.

12:26.574 --> 12:38.312
There you'd see your classmates a little more, but 
there would not be any program to keep you

12:26.574 --> 12:38.312
together, to relate to each other, to depend on 
each other. That's very, very true. All right,

12:42.227 --> 12:47.756
this is probably saying the same thing. What did 
you learn at A&M that has had a strong effect on your

12:47.796 --> 12:53.184
life? Well, I think the things that I just related. 
I think hard work, integrity,

13:09.477 --> 13:12.189
I guess comradeship to a certain extent. But I 
think those, I think.

13:17.474 --> 13:18.880
All right, if you were the consultant, selected to 
come in and advise the A&M decision makers today

13:20.345 --> 13:32.060
about what they should do more of or less of in the 
future to keep A&M moving forward. What advice

13:32.120 --> 13:34.123
would you give them? Well, I think A&M is faced 
with, you know, several problems. I think they've

13:38.689 --> 13:42.994
done, in my opinion, almost everything right. I 
think their political skills are abysmal and I

13:42.974 --> 14:04.041
don't think you can live in this world and relate to 
Austin and Washington because unfortunately

13:42.974 --> 14:04.041
more and more of your success or failure depends on 
and I think we've got to do a better job relating

13:42.974 --> 14:04.041
with the political structure. You can't sit in 
College Station and say they can't touch me and I'm

14:04.201 --> 14:09.608
not going to worry about them. That's true. I think 
the university, and this is damned if they do,

14:12.303 --> 14:26.262
damned if they don't,

14:12.303 --> 14:26.262
the university is going to have to recognize the 
Hispanic population in the state.

14:30.668 --> 14:40.842
When you look at the population, and I think A&M has 
been, because it is so homogeneous, They've been

14:42.340 --> 14:45.886
able to set goals and stick with them. That's been 
the positive side. Whereas if you have this

14:47.608 --> 14:57.264
diverse population, you have too many different

14:47.608 --> 14:57.264
directions that people are tugging to go in. So 
their own success may be their own failure

14:57.344 --> 15:01.851
ultimately. They're going to have to recognize 
that Hispanic population, especially in

15:02.624 --> 15:08.751
relation to Austin and Washington. And I don't 
know. I think once they become more diverse down

15:10.252 --> 15:15.818
there, they're going to start having problems 
they haven't had before. And I don't think you're

15:16.439 --> 15:24.007
going to have the things we've talked about for two 
or three hours are going to have the significance

15:16.439 --> 15:24.007
or the impact that they used to. And that's sad, 
too. uh got a couple more serious questions but

15:27.430 --> 15:55.227
before we get to that do you have a favorite aggie 
story amusing or serious or goofy or

15:27.430 --> 15:55.227
any any good bull that you remember you

15:27.430 --> 15:55.227
know i haven't thought about this in so long

15:27.430 --> 15:55.227
oh i some joke that you and some other guys play you 
mentioned the the the other night the other

15:57.316 --> 16:23.492
morning you mentioned the uh steam tunnel and 
dumping the oh oh yeah but i think everybody did

15:57.316 --> 16:23.492
that uh what about uh babo bombs or putting 
something in somebody's room did well i do

15:57.316 --> 16:23.492
remember putting uh we used to um you could you 
could break the glass off of a regular

15:57.316 --> 16:23.492
incandescent bulb and you could tie a firecracker 
to the filament if it didn't break. Then you could

16:31.089 --> 16:34.733
put it inside a paper sack filled with flour.

16:37.496 --> 16:39.858
That took some engineering. When you turned on the 
light switch, kaboom, flour went everywhere. Oh,

16:44.403 --> 16:48.307
I've not heard of that one before. Probably why you 
haven't, it took a lot of work. Did that ever happen

16:50.469 --> 16:52.091
in your outfit? Oh, yeah. Oh, yeah. Alright, then 
who got to clean the room up? The freshmen? Well,

16:58.330 --> 17:02.779
first they had to find out who they thought did it. 
This happened actually in my sophomore year, and

17:03.541 --> 17:12.160
it took a while to build the thing.

17:15.228 --> 17:17.872
And I imagine some guys hadn't cleaned it up. Those 
of us that might have been involved were long gone

17:18.212 --> 17:22.658
to the movie. We weren't around to be found. What 
about a serious Aggie story? Do you have a heart

17:28.446 --> 17:30.449
touching one? Well, I'm sure there was.

17:40.726 --> 17:47.553
I thought those two Aggies had crashed their plane 
on the drill field at the bonfire, those two

17:40.726 --> 17:47.553
Hensons. That was a tragic situation. Did you know 
about the existence of secret fraternities when

17:50.576 --> 17:55.081
you were there? Oh, that was all over, all over the 
place. The TTs, and they disbanded them my junior

17:57.584 --> 18:03.170
year. I never knew about them really until it all of 
a sudden it boiled up in the battalion. What about

18:09.903 --> 18:10.844
the stickers? Did you know about them? No, I didn't 
know anything about them. I never knew anything

18:14.187 --> 18:18.050
about that they even existed until it was in the 
battalion. If you were to make a major gift to Texas

18:20.112 --> 18:31.363
A&M, for what purpose would you want that gift 
used? I think for the electrical engineering

18:32.944 --> 18:34.886
department. What would you want them to do? 
Whatever they decided to do with it. And why do you

18:38.860 --> 18:42.865
feel that grateful to electrical engineering? 
Well, I think whatever success I had came from

18:43.786 --> 18:46.949
there.

18:50.854 --> 18:53.057
This is next to the last one. To what A&M former 
students, faculty, friends do you feel most

18:53.077 --> 18:58.643
grateful and why? Well, like I said, I feel a 
tremendous amount of gratitude to the electrical

19:00.145 --> 19:08.715
engineering faculty, to the college as a whole. 
And then I have people like Joe Walker, who was a

19:09.691 --> 19:17.144
classmate of mine at A&M.

19:25.538 --> 19:34.433
I just think that the experience there is, people 
are lucky to have been able to partake of. Last

19:35.037 --> 19:35.778
question. What feelings do you carry in your heart 
for Texas A&M? Oh, a tremendous amount of love and

19:39.465 --> 19:41.228
respect. I mean,

19:43.292 --> 19:52.007
people, I think it's expressed best with, you 
know, it's a religion almost. And people don't

19:53.330 --> 19:54.672
understand that. That's a good point to put on.
