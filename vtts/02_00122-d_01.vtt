WEBVTT

00:02.798 --> 00:28.284
Well,

00:02.798 --> 00:28.284
when we were choosing between the College Board 
and the American College Testing Code, Dean

00:02.798 --> 00:28.284
Hubert told me, he said, now, Austin, you've got to 
structure this thing where these people that you

00:02.798 --> 00:28.284
have examine these tests, that they feel that 
they're not wasting their time. And I said, yes,

00:28.845 --> 00:31.367
sir, we'll do that. So if We chose the College 
Board, and I use the word we because it was chosen by

00:32.549 --> 00:46.343
the deans and the heads of departments all over the 
campus. The Counseling Center didn't choose the

00:46.383 --> 01:00.177
College Board, although we felt that that was the 
one that was better suited for our needs. Well,

01:01.473 --> 01:08.654
this was a fine program that Dr. Wayne Hall had. You 
see, he had a pragmatic, a practical measurement

01:16.340 --> 01:24.070
of what we were doing and how much economics. Oh, 
Chalk, you know Chalk, yeah? Chalk would be in my,

01:27.535 --> 01:33.403
he'd be in our center the morning the test would be. 
And he would have his list of his men in

01:34.385 --> 01:44.338
order. And he said, this is the greatest thing that 
ever happened to me. He said, I've always

01:51.461 --> 01:58.433
wondered, how good a job are we doing? And, oh, that 
economics department was very high. Biology was

02:04.302 --> 02:06.085
very high. But a lot of, only,

02:12.263 --> 02:15.627
Well, we had a little trouble with agriculture. 
But Dr. Wayne Hall, being in agriculture, he asked

02:15.647 --> 02:26.460
these young men, he said, are you scientists? And 
they said, well, yes. He said, all right. These are

02:30.665 --> 02:32.667
science tests. He said, what kind of a scientist 
are you? Are you a biologist? Are you, you know,

02:37.293 --> 02:39.115
this or that? And pretty soon the students saw that 
what he was telling them was that you may be a plant

02:39.854 --> 03:01.195
physiologist,

02:39.854 --> 03:01.195
but you take the course, you take the test that will 
measure plant physiology. But they won't call it

03:01.215 --> 03:03.457
plant physiology. There are not that many taking 
it. But if you look at the questions, you'll find it

03:06.119 --> 03:08.882
there. Well, it was a shame, but now, we even had 
Berkeley. Berkeley sent a professor, full

03:17.216 --> 03:31.440
professor, who spent three days with us studying 
what we had done with these

03:17.216 --> 03:31.440
measures. And he said, how in the world did you get 
your profs to do it? Well, now Haskell, that goes

03:36.233 --> 03:40.138
back to our heritage. Now, did you find good 
continuity during these years between the

03:40.178 --> 03:51.032
different vice presidents for academics? Was 
there good continuity of interest by each of them

03:51.833 --> 04:05.110
in, whether we called it the Counseling and 
Testing Service, the Academic Counseling

03:51.833 --> 04:05.110
Center, was there good continuity in there? I 
think that it was to the extent that the person who

04:05.697 --> 04:25.680
was in the office at that time understood the 
contributions that a guidance center can make.

04:26.120 --> 04:31.907
You know, some people think a guidance center is 
somewhat for children. And they don't see the

04:32.596 --> 04:35.820
implications. You did, I remember. Wayne Hall 
did. Now, Dr. Calhoun, once he was able to get

04:43.529 --> 05:02.552
acquainted with what our situation was, Dr. 
Calhoun was a strong supporter of the, oh, I think

04:43.529 --> 05:02.552
old Mac Prescott got in real trouble because he 
kept bad mouthing the summer conferences. And I

05:10.151 --> 05:16.679
understand Dr. Calhoun read and write that to him 
and said he didn't want to hear any more of it. Well,

05:17.360 --> 05:29.535
Dr. Calhoun told me, he said, Austin, you ought to 
feel pretty good when you can have a program where

05:17.360 --> 05:29.535
people pay to come see it and hear it. And it doesn't 
cost us anything. We just get to do it. I think Dr.

05:35.298 --> 05:42.385
Calhoun was very much interested. Now, when this 
got into what to me was a difficult position, Dr.

05:43.226 --> 05:59.202
Colgus was pushing harder and harder for a 
counseling center. But that word meant

06:00.447 --> 06:05.656
different, had a different meaning to him. Yes. 
And he was not an academic man. The real problem for

06:12.708 --> 06:26.050
him was that the academic people, the counseling 
was in The academic effort of the university, I

06:26.468 --> 06:31.775
think, is where it belongs. That was my personal 
feeling. I think that it's like in our high school.

06:43.532 --> 06:48.699
We should never have thrust the drug problem on 
high school counselors. They're not trained

06:50.001 --> 06:54.147
sufficient for that. it ruins their relationship 
to make contribution in the afternoon. I know you

07:00.758 --> 07:09.411
understood that years ago because we talked about 
it on some of our problems. I think Dr. Byers simply

07:10.292 --> 07:21.889
did not have a background and now this But now this 
changed some, because I think he had a

07:22.291 --> 07:39.727
granddaughter that had some real problems in 
school, and the counselor was able to help the

07:22.291 --> 07:39.727
person, so he began to see a little bit there.

07:43.831 --> 07:50.037
Now, when I was moved under

07:50.776 --> 07:56.802
Now that occurred about when? That occurred all 
along about 75. So that's about the time, that's

08:02.928 --> 08:09.995
either Calhoun's last years? That was his last 
year. Now Dr. Calhoun told me, as I remember, that

08:19.160 --> 08:31.870
he said, Austin, I'm going to put you over under Ed 
Cooper, as long as Ed Cooper is dean of the records.

08:35.866 --> 08:38.470
I think he meant Coles. You helped by telling 
Coles. No one has ever told you you couldn't have a

08:42.816 --> 08:46.521
counseling center. Of course, now, Coles told me, 
he said, I don't want your staff, I just want your

08:46.661 --> 08:54.552
money. I thought, well, he's honest. I came of the 
background where the guidance is a part of the

09:04.165 --> 09:10.116
educational system. It is not a part of the student 
life system. That is my background.

09:21.817 --> 09:24.743
Let's do a long view now. Based on your experience,

09:28.904 --> 09:37.938
What were the important decisions in the area 
where you were involved or related to it that you

09:28.904 --> 09:37.938
think were key positive decisions? And if there 
were any important negative ones, what were the

09:38.999 --> 09:46.731
key negative decisions that were made? Well, I 
think that we were fortunate in having a

09:46.952 --> 09:56.346
background of Well, the basic division. The basic 
division could be looked upon as somewhat of a

09:59.162 --> 10:03.628
guidance. That added to the record of the academic 
people working with the student. The fact that we

10:15.683 --> 10:25.776
worked closely with the

10:15.683 --> 10:25.776
cohort was necessary. I think the ROTC movement 
would tell you now that it worked out for the best of

10:26.650 --> 10:42.315
the university and the student. Instead of trying 
to stubbornly shove the core onto the university,

10:43.457 --> 10:53.873
let it find its place.

10:54.376 --> 11:17.187
I feel like that we were able to acquaint 
professors with

10:54.376 --> 11:17.187
what the services can be provided a professor that 
will make his work more effective. Sometimes

11:17.207 --> 11:21.312
that's helping in research of student 
characteristics. Sometimes it's like in the,

11:22.034 --> 11:28.902
well, the summer conferences. The fellow who had 
charge of freshman English, the

11:29.002 --> 11:41.317
setting up the sections.

11:43.299 --> 11:50.488
Haskell, in the last year, after I retired, I went 
back one summer and helped them with these.

11:51.160 --> 11:54.365
conferences by taking groups of students. I found 
out was this young man said to me, he said, I need

11:55.728 --> 12:00.716
some help. He said, I put my program through twice 
for my request for courses and all I'm able to

12:00.736 --> 12:14.940
register in is English and physical education. 
And he said, what am I going to do? He said, I got to

12:18.182 --> 12:26.613
call my father in Chicago and tell him that I'm 
going to go to school, but I only can take two

12:18.182 --> 12:26.613
courses. Well, Haskell, that was unnecessary. We 
developed just a number of controls of these

12:32.300 --> 12:37.887
students. And I remember one of

12:37.907 --> 12:45.417
my first occurrences of this type. They

12:50.528 --> 13:13.632
had the associate dean's meeting on Saturday 
morning after the last and apparently there was a

12:50.528 --> 13:13.632
big mess up on no sections and all of this and Dr. 
Calhoun had called these people together And Dr.

13:14.455 --> 13:20.982
Calhoun said,

13:14.455 --> 13:20.982
what in the world caused this? And Lannis Holt 
said, I don't know, but I can tell you this, that if

13:21.363 --> 13:38.783
you had called Austin Curry, he could have told you 
within at least 30 or 40 of how many students would

13:21.363 --> 13:38.783
be needing that course. And Dr. Calhoun said, 
well, when could he have done this? He said he's

13:41.866 --> 13:44.209
kept it all summer. Well, that was a flaw of Haskell 
that I don't know, I'm sure Lannis remembered, but

13:44.712 --> 13:56.368
that was not necessary. So that's an example of a 
service that is available and could have been

13:57.750 --> 14:06.342
used, but the person didn't know it. Now this 
fellow that handled the English sections, he

14:06.362 --> 14:12.711
heard about what we were doing. So he comes over to 
the counseling center and we start giving him the

14:13.180 --> 14:19.030
fingers. And he said, he said, I'll tell you what, 
it beats having a yelling match with being beaten.

14:30.650 --> 14:38.023
But I don't know how this, whether this is 
answering what we're saying or not. The

14:38.780 --> 14:48.751
University Counseling Center should be one that 
it's a service. And it should be structured in a way

14:50.593 --> 15:00.525
that it can help people help themselves. It's not a 
crutch. It is not judgmental. It, it should do good

15:08.446 --> 15:11.990
research. I was kind of amused out here after they, 
I knew that when they merged, I was a little

15:13.552 --> 15:25.626
surprised that shuttle mechanics merged those 
two. Because they had too much not in common.

15:33.725 --> 15:55.884
Gradually, within about two years, I think it

15:33.725 --> 15:55.884
was, all of the counseling staff had resigned or 
moved somewhere

15:33.725 --> 15:55.884
else. There is no reason. Well, the interesting 
thing is that at the University of Texas, while we

15:57.856 --> 16:07.372
were merging, they were separated.

16:08.614 --> 16:20.573
If you were hired as a consultant today to give 
advice about the area that you knew best, what

16:08.614 --> 16:20.573
would be your advice to the university today?

16:23.152 --> 16:33.982
From my field, which really where my real interest 
lies is in career counseling. They still have the

16:34.843 --> 16:40.628
same thing they had when I came in 1952. They have 
the problem of the undecided student.

16:50.911 --> 17:02.093
attempted to help it by making group guidance 
courses where a student would take a course and

16:50.911 --> 17:02.093
then we would carry them through a frequency. Now, 
Haskell, we were not great shots at this, but we did

17:02.855 --> 17:12.835
not have many who had not made a decision by the 
second semester. Now they have people still

17:13.844 --> 17:20.997
struggling around in the late sophomore year, as I 
understand it. And I think one of the complicating

17:21.017 --> 17:33.601
factors now also is that some of the colleges are 
now setting up a numerical limit on how many they

17:21.017 --> 17:33.601
will allow to come into their program. Yes. So here 
are some students then kind of in no man's land or no

17:34.347 --> 17:41.355
woman's land. And where do they go and what do they 
do? Your advice, as I'm understanding it, would be

17:45.740 --> 18:02.740
that there be, and I'll give it a generic title, a 
counseling center having to do with academics and

17:45.740 --> 18:02.740
with professional goals in life. Yes. where that 
there might be somewhere else a counseling center

18:03.254 --> 18:12.608
that helped young people work on their personal 
problems. But these are two different units.

18:15.512 --> 18:22.563
Where would be the best place for the academic 
counseling center, as we're now organized, where

18:15.512 --> 18:22.563
would it be located? Who should that Well, I think 
it should be in the academic structure. Because to

18:31.495 --> 18:44.094
me,

18:31.495 --> 18:44.094
the preparation of a person for a profession is 
academic. It is not student life. If a person is

18:48.019 --> 18:50.423
having a drug problem, then they should treat that 
by the people who are qualified in the medical

18:51.517 --> 19:06.807
profession and come back to the... You see, what 
we're trying to do is somewhat like it is in the

18:51.517 --> 19:06.807
public schools. We're trying to solve every 
problem a person has. without any relationship to

19:12.728 --> 19:17.175
are we suited for it? Do we have the facilities? Do 
we have the staff? It's the same with, we need to

19:23.865 --> 19:41.571
work out some kind of a program where the person can 
be aware

19:23.865 --> 19:41.571
that If they are not doing well in a program, then 
people in my field would help them find out why. Is

19:55.841 --> 19:57.443
it because you don't understand? Is it because 
you've taken the wrong courses? These are not

20:00.586 --> 20:27.859
things that are related to sex, and I'm not poking 
fun here, but we need to get help to students in the

20:00.586 --> 20:27.859
area in which competency can be seen on both sides.

20:29.307 --> 20:35.253
Now, Texas University, they're pretty screwed. 
They have encouraged many freshmen to go to a

20:35.593 --> 20:42.500
two-year college. First one thing, there are 
several options there.

20:50.508 --> 20:58.116
I'm afraid that we take students, and I don't mean 
this critically, but we take students And we don't

20:58.315 --> 21:01.378
have a program for them. And they don't know what 
the program is. So that is the dilemma. There are

21:08.345 --> 21:13.751
more, as I understand it, that is Hope's daughter 
hedging it up. I understand that General Studies,

21:14.611 --> 21:18.295
I think they call it. It shouldn't be much 
different than General Curriculum.

21:24.061 --> 21:27.985
They are in there. Old sophomore? And that's no 
good. I mean,

21:33.711 --> 21:39.460
I don't know. I don't want to sound like I know all 
the answers, but we are, we may be confusing things

21:39.941 --> 21:55.845
to the student about what we do in this area. I doubt 
if there's any particular help on the campus to

21:56.669 --> 22:04.719
what I'm saying.

22:05.440 --> 22:11.227
Again, looking at the broad view, why has A&M made 
the progress it has made? A&M's a much different

22:13.470 --> 22:19.377
school now than what it was when you first arrived 
back here. What were the reasons, why did A&M make

22:25.559 --> 22:27.982
the progress it made? Well, I think that, now, A&M 
has always, to me, has been honest about what it was

22:28.002 --> 22:40.797
doing. You see, when I came back in 52, we had Math 
100, English 100, Chemistry 100. That was because

22:50.147 --> 22:54.132
there were people who needed it. Now, in about two 
or three years, that began to fade out because the

22:54.618 --> 23:13.665
public schools got back into control, the 
families reorganized,

22:54.618 --> 23:13.665
and young people were coming who were better 
qualified. Now, we did not give in on standards.

23:21.145 --> 23:45.803
You

23:21.145 --> 23:45.803
know, you were here in then, lots of universities 
bent, and I used to have a difficulty at the college

23:21.145 --> 23:45.803
board meeting because I took a firm stand on that, 
that you will never put out a medical doctor by

23:46.289 --> 23:56.646
letting them study medicine just because they 
really wanted to or what have you. Well, we've got

23:57.046 --> 24:01.774
to be honest with them. We've got to say, you know, 
John, you have some good qualities here. There's

24:10.648 --> 24:12.010
this fellow. I did some work for the dental college 
in Houston in this respect. And they sent this

24:20.856 --> 24:25.223
young man up to us. He was an A&M undergraduate by 
his degree, and he was studying dentistry. It was

24:33.678 --> 24:34.920
the second year. It's very serious. when the 
staff, the teaching staff for the dental school

24:39.395 --> 24:47.765
has to drop a student. It's a kind of a, well, it 
upsets everyone. There's a lot of money put into

24:53.231 --> 24:56.295
that. Well, this young man, he came out to see us. 
And so he said, I know why I'm here. and I appreciate

25:06.327 --> 25:09.131
any help you can do. So we gave him a routine 
screening and

25:09.972 --> 25:29.260
we suggested to him that he take another look at his 
background and that he work with children.

25:29.600 --> 25:32.284
That could be in elementary schools, It could be in 
a different kind. But that would be an area where he

25:35.488 --> 25:41.234
would probably be very happy. And I looked this 
man's name up the other day in the Aggie

25:42.194 --> 25:52.565
dictionary, I call it. And this fella is now in 
charge of the Head Start program in the state of

25:52.585 --> 26:00.313
Colorado. He's been up there for whatever, a 
decade. But that's what I mean. What a university

26:06.799 --> 26:25.400
owes to me owes a service to a student that if 
they're not meeting the terms of the goal that they

26:06.799 --> 26:25.400
have, the profession, we should not just kick them 
out. But we ought to identify them, work with them,

26:28.981 --> 26:33.425
and help them leave the city. As we're getting near 
the end now,

26:33.825 --> 26:44.975
what I'm really asking are parts of the university 
that are dearest to your heart, and let me ask it in

26:33.825 --> 26:44.975
this manner. Let's make believe someone handed 
you a million-dollar check and said, you can give

26:45.015 --> 26:58.667
this check, you must give this money to Texas A&M, 
but you've got to decide what it would be spent for.

26:59.643 --> 27:07.192
If you were going to be generous to A&M, for what 
purpose would you want your generosity used?

27:10.576 --> 27:22.410
Well, I feel like, and of course I revert to my 
biases, I feel like that We do have a strong

27:22.745 --> 27:35.164
counseling center on the campus, but it is not 
strong in the area of career planning. I don't mean

27:35.184 --> 27:39.550
that critically, but it just isn't. I would 
visualize that there would be, well, President

27:40.612 --> 27:50.507
Rutter's admonition, there would be a center for 
career planning. There would be, that would be

27:55.635 --> 27:59.279
open. It would be open to students. I used to do 
this. I used to, I'd have people from Amarillo

28:06.047 --> 28:19.482
write me and want to bring their son or daughter to 
the A&M campus for counseling, vocational

28:06.047 --> 28:19.482
counseling. I said, no, that's a long trip. Go to 
your high school counselor. Tell her that I said

28:28.314 --> 28:36.303
that I was well aware of how her workload is. But 
would she be willing to administer the test to the

28:37.224 --> 28:47.376
student back at Amarillo And we would share the 
findings with her. And oh, I never had one turned

28:53.205 --> 28:56.069
down. They all, you know, that

28:56.109 --> 29:03.078
got out. One of the problems we had in this program 
was that at first, we were having a lot of students

29:04.660 --> 29:13.190
not show up. And I couldn't believe that. But when 
we looked into it, we found that this is what

29:17.917 --> 29:22.564
happened. These people in Dallas, wherever, they 
talk together. These people that keep up. And so

29:33.380 --> 29:36.444
they said, let's send Johnny down. Let's let him 
apply to A&M. And then he goes through this

29:38.668 --> 29:41.912
guidance program. And they don't have anything 
like that at SMU or at this. And so that's when we had

29:47.667 --> 29:55.016
to sort of start tying it up more. But I feel like 
that first, the cost of an education is tragic, but

29:55.036 --> 30:09.233
it's getting to where it's unreasonable. 
Secondly, there

30:09.253 --> 30:17.083
simply is not Well,

30:17.907 --> 30:41.873
the student, I don't know, the student just, the 
age problem,

30:17.907 --> 30:41.873
I think one of the problems is that youngsters do 
not have the advantages of experiences. that

30:42.697 --> 30:47.684
youngsters had of the same age several years ago. 
So we need to work closely, A&M will work closely

30:48.285 --> 30:58.880
with the academic counselors in the high school. I 
think they will come to this. And the third thing

31:02.164 --> 31:12.619
would be that they would help the student if they 
were here and it didn't look good. Now, the fourth

31:18.598 --> 31:30.007
thing I think is that the university needs to have a 
continuing relationship in this field. We could

31:30.668 --> 31:42.758
make some fine contributions to the whole field of 
knowledge of college choice. career choice, this

31:43.362 --> 31:46.790
sort of thing. If we could work on past the, well, 
I've worked with graduate students, master's

31:46.810 --> 31:57.675
degree candidates.
