WEBVTT

00:03.288 --> 00:18.474
And I don't know, maybe I shouldn't say this, but I 
don't know whether Joe was a political high or not,

00:03.288 --> 00:18.474
because his brother was president of Corpus 
Christi State at the time, and was kind of the

00:03.288 --> 00:18.474
fair-haired lad of the system, I think. But then 
in...

00:26.423 --> 00:28.506
Oh, yeah, it was November the 8th. I'll never 
forget it. I'd been trying to get one of my

00:30.608 --> 00:36.275
supervisors reclassified. We'd gotten into the 
sign business by that time, and I had a graphics

00:36.295 --> 00:42.943
supervisor, and I was afraid I was going to lose him 
if I didn't get him reclassified. And I'd been

00:44.965 --> 00:49.731
trying to get a meeting with Robert for two and a 
half months to talk about it. because you didn't do

00:51.061 --> 00:56.611
anything like that without Robert's blessings 
right off the top. You know, it had Had to go up and

00:58.537 --> 01:00.859
then had to come back around and through. And so I 
went up to visit with Robert and had all my stuff.

01:06.605 --> 01:15.393
And he was up in Rudder Tower at his office and had a 
little conference table right by the entrance to

01:06.605 --> 01:15.393
his office. And he was over by the window and he 
said, go ahead and sit down. So I sat down and spread

01:18.756 --> 01:20.257
my stuff out. And he came over and he said, I'm going 
to merge grounds and physical plant. and pitched a

01:27.967 --> 01:33.681
packet over to me, sliding across the table, and 
said, there's your new job. I said, oh? He said,

01:35.465 --> 01:36.508
yeah. And I said, Robert, you don't fix something 
unless it's broke, and we sure as hell aren't

01:36.528 --> 01:42.322
broke. He said, well, that's what I'm going to do. 
and uh so i you know was shocked i mean because i

01:47.626 --> 02:10.039
thought robert and i had gotten along very well but 
and i never did understand a lot of the why of it but i

01:47.626 --> 02:10.039
wound up as deputy director of physical plant in 
november of 90. i went to talk to joe sugg and all

02:10.829 --> 02:14.153
like that, and he didn't want to talk to me a whole 
lot, you know. I spent from November until

02:15.114 --> 02:21.261
September, I didn't do a thing. Now, was this a, as 
you understood it, was this a promotion? Well, Joe

02:27.909 --> 02:29.190
says it was. Joe Sugg said it was, and I said, well, I 
don't see how you can call it a promotion, you know.

02:35.703 --> 02:44.676
And I went to, I don't know whether you remember 
Leroy Johnson or not, he was assistant director of

02:35.703 --> 02:44.676
fiscal planning over the fiscal, and Leroy and I 
had known each other for years. And I kept going to

02:44.696 --> 02:50.745
him, I said, you know, when the budgets come up, I 
want to see if my job's in the budget. Because I had

02:51.486 --> 02:56.293
some strong premonition that my title would not be 
in the budget. But it was. I'd talk to my son, who's

03:00.936 --> 03:09.355
an attorney, to see what, because I'd never gotten 
anything but commendations and all like this. And

03:09.615 --> 03:15.328
I didn't think they could fire me, but I didn't 
think they had any kind of grounds. So then Joe

03:15.308 --> 03:43.695
decided that I guess that I wasn't going anywhere 
and that he needed to get me doing something so we

03:15.308 --> 03:43.695
had had developed a geographic information 
system and so he put me put the geographic

03:15.308 --> 03:43.695
information system under me which was kind of a 
godsend because that was something that I liked I

03:15.308 --> 03:43.695
knew what it was about you could see the value of it 
and trying to get that get that going so I had that

03:15.308 --> 03:43.695
and Oh, I did a few other little things, but I was 
explicitly kept out of anything I'd been involved

03:43.675 --> 03:54.329
in for the last 25 or 30 years. And nobody ever gave 
you any explanation? And a sub would threaten me

04:00.657 --> 04:06.064
and say, you talk to Robert Smith and I'll fire you 
on the spot. He told anybody that. Nobody went up

04:10.490 --> 04:11.792
above him. And then Robert served for how much 
longer? Well, he served until early 94. He and Joe

04:18.433 --> 04:20.177
got involved. We needed some additional 
generation capacity. And so they got this thing

04:23.586 --> 04:28.920
about a third-party generation power plant. And 
unfortunately, you know, I wouldn't wish this on

04:30.419 --> 04:33.847
anybody. Robert got sick. You know, he developed, 
I guess, prostate cancer. And he got to the point

04:40.142 --> 04:44.171
that he couldn't handle everything. You know, he 
was away. He just couldn't do it. And Sugg was way

04:48.180 --> 04:49.423
out. He'd gotten permission from Robert, I guess, 
too. And I think Robert was working on pretty

04:54.890 --> 05:04.803
direct orders from Margraves, who was chairman of 
the board at that time. And then things kind of went

05:10.514 --> 05:17.467
started coming apart after this, because this was 
kind of a design and build thing, and nobody was

05:10.514 --> 05:17.467
supervising them. They were tearing stuff up and 
all like this. And the upshot was that in probably

05:21.915 --> 05:28.067
June, Well, I guess Ray Bowen had come by then. And 
then by June, May or June of, I think, yeah, it was

05:32.302 --> 05:43.069
94, he replaced Robert. And then it wasn't too long 
until they replaced Joe, asked Joe to move aside.

05:54.180 --> 05:58.767
This was after Jerry Gaston was named interim vice 
president. And I'd known Jerry a long time. And

06:02.033 --> 06:04.737
so... In late August of that year, Jerry, he called 
me and said, would you be interim director of

06:04.717 --> 06:14.870
physical plant for about 60 days till we can find 
somebody? I said, okay. He said, are you

06:15.971 --> 06:16.832
interested? I said, no, it's a doable job, but I'm 
who I am. I'm a green person. I need to be dealing

06:22.400 --> 06:26.725
with stuff that I've dealt with for the last 30 or 40 
years. And so then we had all sorts of problems with

06:28.814 --> 06:51.902
utilities and we had to, we had to, uh, the state 
management audit was going, had just been

06:28.814 --> 06:51.902
initiated and, um, a number of areas, you know, 
they were looking at a number of utilities was one

06:28.814 --> 06:51.902
of them and they'd gotten, I think, Probably 80% of 
the, they had an 800 number, and about 80% of the 800

06:53.654 --> 07:00.762
calls they got was from the Department of 
Utilities. I mean, it was, we had a gentleman by the

07:02.284 --> 07:09.292
name of Al Baxter that Joe had hired, and I think Al 
was probably a pretty good engineer. He had hired

07:09.852 --> 07:13.156
another guy that was not too swift. I mean, his 
personnel dealings were just, but at any rate,

07:19.878 --> 07:31.221
there were a lot of complaints there, and so I was 
having to respond to a lot of these questions, and

07:19.878 --> 07:31.221
in the meantime, Leroy Johnson had retired on me, 
so I had, I had my old job, what little was my old job,

07:31.370 --> 07:36.278
the director's job, and Leroy's job, you know. And 
I dealt with Jerry, and I got to know Jerry, I knew

07:37.260 --> 07:43.471
Jerry pretty well, but I got to really know Jerry 
real well. You know, we worked, oh God, we worked so

07:43.771 --> 07:46.416
closely together. And responding to all this, and 
then it became relevant that we had a problem in

07:47.438 --> 07:51.845
utilities. So in early January, of 95, we put both 
Al Baxter and Don Thompson, was the guy's name, on

07:55.231 --> 08:07.011
administrative leave with pay because there was 
just so much there we had to investigate. And then

08:07.071 --> 08:10.397
we appointed a three-person committee to look 
into it. And they did all their looking and all like

08:11.419 --> 08:13.763
this. and came back and we decided there was 
grounds and Al Baxter in the meantime had decided

08:14.165 --> 08:31.178
he needed to go elsewhere and so he saw the 
handwriting on the wall but they were, I had told

08:14.165 --> 08:31.178
them me back up a little bit on normally during 
Christmas break we would do some chill water

08:32.423 --> 08:53.689
outages to do maintenance and this kind of thing 
because that's about the only time of the year that

08:32.423 --> 08:53.689
you've got a clear shot at people not being in 
buildings or at least very few people and so they

08:32.423 --> 08:53.689
were also working on a an in-house project that Joe 
had, and I was just getting into some of this, that

08:54.175 --> 09:00.988
he had let them do. They were going to split the 
chill water system into four distinct systems.

09:08.283 --> 09:09.164
which bothered me. And they were going to put some, 
and they'd bought four 900 horsepower turbine

09:09.184 --> 09:18.820
pumps to put one on each thing. And Estill called me 
and said, they're going to blow the place up, Gene.

09:22.265 --> 09:24.869
They're going to blow it up because he'd gotten 
wind of it. And I respect Joe. Joe's a very good

09:27.233 --> 09:28.435
engineer. And so I canceled the outage because I 
knew they were going to do some work on these pumps

09:29.356 --> 09:36.147
as a part of that. And so then they came up and met 
with me and they said, we've got to have an outage or

09:37.645 --> 09:44.317
we can't guarantee chill water next year. I said, 
okay, you go ahead and have your outage, but do not

09:44.397 --> 09:54.176
do anything in support of the big pumping system. 
Period. And apparently they did. And as the

09:57.954 --> 10:08.926
investigation team turned up, they did almost 500 
contract millwright man hours in direct support

09:57.954 --> 10:08.926
of those pumps. You know, I mean, huge pipe welding 
and all like this. And I told Jerry, I said, you

10:13.330 --> 10:19.657
know, if I had known they were working on that 
during Christmas, I'd have gone out and fired both

10:13.330 --> 10:19.657
of them on the spot. And he said, yeah, I think I'd 
have been right behind you. But Anyway, we had to

10:25.283 --> 10:27.286
work through that. And then ultimately, Don 
Thompson sued both. That's still going on, I

10:30.911 --> 10:32.353
guess. I don't know. I hear from the lawyers every 
now and then. And so my 60 days as interim ended on

10:37.520 --> 10:44.389
the last of August. exactly a year afterwards when 
Chuck Scipio came. And then I worked for Chuck for a

10:50.940 --> 10:53.383
while. And Jerry had asked me if I wanted to apply 
for it. And I said, no, I think I'm going to retire

10:57.167 --> 11:00.230
before long. And whoever gets it needs some years 
in the job. And I said, at that point in time, I still

11:06.216 --> 11:11.001
had some that they might break grounds back out or 
that I might get back into some of that. And that's

11:15.652 --> 11:18.417
where I was headed. But

11:19.439 --> 11:24.186
that didn't happen. So you retired when? I retired 
in February of 98. February of 98. Yeah, it was 25

11:32.320 --> 11:33.542
years to the day. Exactly a quarter century. Yeah. 
Let's see, did you ever have any system

11:37.745 --> 11:42.052
responsibilities? No, not delineated. I'd 
gotten to the point in my relationship, even after

11:45.959 --> 11:59.162
the merger, Joe Sugg didn't like this, but they 
would call and say, we need some help. And I would go

11:59.497 --> 12:07.950
over, particularly Charles Caffey had replaced 
Paul Stevens at the time, and they'd have some

11:59.497 --> 12:07.950
plans. Oh, particularly they did a lot of work down 
at Prairie View, landscape work, and down at

12:07.970 --> 12:13.358
Galveston. And I went down, Estill borrowed me a 
time or two, and I went down to Galveston to help him

12:13.598 --> 12:18.425
out on some things. Did you here have 
responsibility for the Chancellor's home?

12:24.975 --> 12:25.116
Mm-hmm. And what about the system building over on 
What is that, 29th? 29th, I guess. Yeah, that all

12:30.929 --> 12:37.000
came about after the merger. I mean, that part of 
it. Now, the chancellor's residence We had a

12:43.557 --> 12:57.175
little problem there with one of the guys in the 
facilities planning, an architect over there,

12:43.557 --> 12:57.175
because they were designing that, and they were 
allocating like $20,000 for landscape. And I told

12:58.076 --> 13:02.202
Bob, I said, Bob, this is a million-dollar house. 
You can't do it. He said, you'll take that and do it

13:02.763 --> 13:04.465
and like it. And I said, we're busy. You need to bid 
this one out. And the landscape architect is a good

13:09.545 --> 13:14.065
friend of mine from San Antonio. And he said, y'all 
need to do this. I said, uh-uh. I don't want to get

13:17.822 --> 13:19.268
caught in that trap. And so they wound up doing a 
little fiddly job out there within that money, and

13:20.092 --> 13:30.425
nobody liked it, so they finally had to come out and 
get some more money and redo it. And particularly

13:31.066 --> 13:39.156
after Perry Atkinson moved in out there, he had 
particularly that front terrace area got redone.

13:39.777 --> 13:40.618
What the cost was? Oh, God, I don't know. Probably 
$50,000. What about the big, I was gone at this

13:45.704 --> 13:48.968
time, But the big argument, Bob Rucker being in the 
middle of it, about the oak trees over near the MSC,

13:49.403 --> 13:58.844
did those involve your? Yeah. Yeah. Steve Hodge 
and Robert had come to me, you know, about the oak

14:02.612 --> 14:06.300
trees. Robert Smith? Robert Smith, he was, he was 
VP at the time. And, uh, cause this was like an 80s,

14:10.471 --> 14:17.740
early 87 or so that, you know, this is going to take 
some trees. And, uh, so we had some on both sides of

14:18.421 --> 14:27.613
the MSC and I said, well, I think the smaller ones 
could be relocated. You know, that's, that's

14:28.594 --> 14:30.316
where I had hit it. And Robert got into it and. got to 
talking to a gentleman by the name of Al Krennic.

14:38.154 --> 14:45.828
He's the guy that invented the tree spade and sold 
it to Vermeer for a pittance. But anyway, and he was

14:46.128 --> 14:52.840
still digging trees by hand and had fabricated his 
original tree spade. Al came up and looked at them

14:52.820 --> 14:56.443
and said, yeah, we can move these. And then Robert 
got into it and talked to him. And then suddenly,

14:59.486 --> 15:01.628
some of the bigger trees were added. And I said, mm, 
I don't know about that. And Al said, no, I think we

15:05.092 --> 15:07.114
can move them. And so that's how that got started, 
because the trees that I wanted to move were some

15:07.154 --> 15:16.943
that I had planted in 1973 and four, particularly 
along Joe Route. There were four or five of them.

15:18.144 --> 15:20.346
And those are still alive. and two or three plus 
some in Kane Park and one over by the

15:20.326 --> 15:25.231
administration building. And maybe one or two of 
the others are still going, I don't know. But I

15:29.995 --> 15:43.909
think, and I never could prove it, but I think there 
was some help because one or two of those trees went

15:29.995 --> 15:43.909
down overnight.

15:46.031 --> 15:49.074
And that doesn't happen with lack of water. We were 
going in And they provided drainage in

15:50.684 --> 15:58.175
particularly large oak. And in calculating the 
size of the ball and all like this, and we did a lot of

15:58.195 --> 16:06.026
preliminary pruning, you know, it had a good 
chance of working. But we would water real heavily

16:07.768 --> 16:15.840
one day, and then the next day we'd put a little pump 
down to it, and we'd pump the water, the free water

16:07.768 --> 16:15.840
out, you know. And we'd fed them. And they were 
looking pretty, because we did this in probably

16:19.912 --> 16:29.566
January or so, January or February, because it was 
getting kind of late. Yeah, probably February.

16:31.328 --> 16:38.118
And I can remember showing my mother was alive 
then, and we went down for, I guess it was Mother's

16:31.328 --> 16:38.118
Day brunch. And I walked her over and showed her the 
big trees that, you know, just, she was curious

16:38.859 --> 16:44.066
about it. And they were in great shape then. And 
then within, 10 days, and I usually personally

16:50.219 --> 16:53.042
checked them. I looked at them on a daily basis 
because I knew if they died, there was going to be

16:53.383 --> 17:01.512
lots of flak generated on it. And your thought is 
that perhaps somebody deliberately, what could

17:02.373 --> 17:09.802
they have done that would have killed them 
quicker? Well, we had four large pipe. They were

17:12.985 --> 17:18.792
big rectangular type boxed boxes that they boxed 
them in. And they were set on gravel and I think set

17:20.543 --> 17:31.856
on a number of lateral PVC pipes to make sure they 
had plenty of air and drainage. And on each corner,

17:31.877 --> 17:41.468
there was a big four-inch pipe to water in and to 
pump it out with because we'd gotten together and

17:31.877 --> 17:41.468
determined that that was the best approach to it. 
And Al had moved a lot of trees bigger than that and

17:41.648 --> 17:47.395
gotten them to live, you know. uh but they just they 
went down too quick and they browned just like that

17:48.674 --> 18:16.774
and normally you don't do that unless there's some 
kind of foreign agent in there but now am i correct

17:48.674 --> 18:16.774
in recalling that mr rucker thought one of those 
was a pet of president rudder yeah they're they

17:48.674 --> 18:16.774
kept calling the big one the Rotor Oak. And... He 
didn't have any... I didn't, uh-uh. None of us

18:25.911 --> 18:28.554
could say, we don't know where that came from. And I 
think that came from Robert. Robert Smith? Smith.

18:33.980 --> 18:35.783
Now, Smith didn't want to move, or did he? No, he 
did. He did? Yeah, yeah, he did. But this was one

18:38.846 --> 18:40.989
that you thought was too big. I thought it was too 
big. There were three or four that... Robert

18:41.990 --> 18:46.035
talked to Al Krennic, And then Al came back and 
said, well, they want to do this and this. And I

18:51.666 --> 18:53.388
said, Al, I'm afraid those are too big. Because 
what I want to do is like six or seven. They were

18:55.831 --> 18:57.612
trees about like that. I thought that was very 
easily doable. And they were small enough we could

19:00.335 --> 19:03.999
get them around someplace and place them. And we 
put three or four of them over in Kane Park. And one

19:08.403 --> 19:12.047
of them is over by the entrance and exit to Lot 55. 
And I can't think of where the other one is. I knew

19:15.412 --> 19:20.304
those had a good root system because they'd been 
transplanted once or twice before we planted

19:15.412 --> 19:20.304
them. That meant that they had a good, a very thick 
root system. When you do that, trees are a lot more

19:25.517 --> 19:30.990
easily transplantable that way. but now Bob would 
just rant and rave I kind of just backed off you know

19:30.970 --> 19:49.788
I said I agree they're too big you know but I don't 
know whether he thought I had the I was behind it or

19:30.970 --> 19:49.788
not but I was behind moving the small ones because I 
felt that was very very doable. Among the goofy

19:51.770 --> 19:57.315
ideas I've had when some of the larger trees die 
I've always thought, why wouldn't it be good for

19:57.768 --> 20:12.289
some Aggie that has a small little sawmill 
operation to come and get some of the trunks, saw it

19:57.768 --> 20:12.289
up, and to use it to make plaques and or picture 
frames out of that you'd sell to diehard Aggies?

20:12.309 --> 20:13.831
Oh, yeah, yeah. Because there's no value to live 
oak lumber. No, as a lumber, no. Because otherwise

20:22.423 --> 20:24.687
it ends up, I presume, as firewood. Yeah. And let 
some guy who's almost a hobby, let him do that. What

20:32.084 --> 20:45.962
about, looking back, are there any changes in the 
way things were done that we might have done if we'd

20:32.084 --> 20:45.962
had all the experience we now have? How could we 
have done things better?

20:54.907 --> 21:13.429
Probably the primary thing was funding

20:54.907 --> 21:13.429
because the average person does not realize the 
kind of funding it takes to do what people want

20:54.907 --> 21:13.429
done. About what percentage more would have made a 
difference? I think if we'd had 15, 20 percent

21:18.596 --> 21:22.821
more. That was before that was in the early stages 
when they started cutting back on the formula.

21:30.731 --> 21:36.216
But, and I don't even think the formula is a valid 
thing now, if you want to understand. Did the

21:36.236 --> 21:38.078
formula get less and less? Mm-hmm. Formula got 
less and less, and then suddenly it, see, I kind of

21:38.759 --> 21:49.248
got out of the budget picture after the merger, 
because I wasn't allowed to in any of that. Did

21:50.770 --> 21:54.293
grounds maintenance and horticulture, 
floriculture, landscaping, did y'all ever get

21:55.387 --> 22:03.967
any of the PUFF money from the university fund? It 
was all appropriated formula. Right, right. I

22:08.598 --> 22:14.391
tried, I think with, particularly with Chuck 
Cargill and Vandiver, I worked up a program of

22:15.333 --> 22:28.493
landscape rejuvenation and renovation on the 
premise that landscapes wear out just like

22:15.333 --> 22:28.493
mechanical stuff and buildings and things like 
this. And they always said, well, there's not

22:29.755 --> 22:34.061
enough. We can't keep the buildings maintained. 
And I understood, but I had to try.

22:42.434 --> 22:44.277
But one of the things I wanted to do and I tried to 
sell this to Joe Sugg, and he didn't like it, is I

22:44.392 --> 23:01.695
told him I thought we ought to collect acorns from 
the century oak and start, you know, an Aggie oak

22:44.392 --> 23:01.695
project. I wrote up a couple of pages on that. What 
happened to that proposal? I think it went in his

23:06.722 --> 23:07.723
trash. Oh. Because he didn't like it. Oh. And he 
wanted to kill the... the memorial tree program,

23:13.990 --> 23:24.149
which was, that was Bob Walker and I, after Bob got 
some emphasis from, who was chairman of the board,

23:13.990 --> 23:24.149
David Eller. He lost a good friend, an ag from the 
valley, and that was the first memorial tree. Bob

23:32.263 --> 23:33.886
and I talked about this a while. I was I was more 
interested in benches and things like this

23:34.561 --> 23:37.905
because we needed benches. And so he called me up 
and he said, you know, we've been talking about

23:39.026 --> 23:46.075
this and I got some direct marching orders. Come 
over and talk to me. So we sat down and we worked out

23:47.396 --> 23:52.082
our memorial tree program. Well, when Joe Sugg 
came, he said, we're going to do away with that. And

23:56.167 --> 23:58.129
I said, no, we're not. So I called Walker. And I 
said, Bob, we've got a problem. He said, I'm going

24:01.613 --> 24:04.282
to take him to lunch. I said, good. He said, you're 
coming.

24:09.965 --> 24:12.268
We went to lunch up in the tower. And in Bob's own 
very polite way, he explained it to him. So I've

24:21.161 --> 24:23.464
never mentioned the memorial trees again. He 
said, no, this is a program. It's viable. It's

24:27.450 --> 24:28.071
workable. And I want this man on the other end of it. 
And I guess Eller was still chairman of the board

24:34.889 --> 25:03.715
maybe i'm not sure but he said this was initiated 
from the highest position and as long as i'm around

24:34.889 --> 25:03.715
it's going to stay here any questions as far as you 
were aware compared to the other areas underneath

24:34.889 --> 25:03.715
the vice president i'll call it for business were 
you all funded at approximately the same level

24:34.889 --> 25:03.715
were they also their budgets tight Yeah, I think 
their budgets were tight. I never did know much

25:05.847 --> 25:13.338
about the rest of the budgets because it really 
wasn't any of my... But you didn't have the

25:13.358 --> 25:15.902
impression that y'all got cut more? No. There were 
times that, yeah, maybe we did get a little bit

25:17.264 --> 25:29.061
because we were probably a little more expendable 
to some degree than...

25:30.560 --> 25:36.447
Let's say fiscal or personnel or something like 
that.

25:40.291 --> 25:42.594
Some other things that just didn't work? Some 
ideas that somebody had? Oh, yeah. The prairie

25:47.159 --> 25:49.361
film thing. Prairie film? Prairie film. What that 
was, it's an epoxy coated aggregate. It's one of

25:56.229 --> 25:58.812
those ideas that's fantastic on paper. I always 
understood that General Ludeke thought that was a

25:59.753 --> 26:02.717
great idea. Oh, yeah, he did. Yeah, we hashed that 
out in his stuff, you know, and one of the landscape

26:04.299 --> 26:10.867
architects proposed it. And it would have worked 
very well, except it started degenerating

26:12.490 --> 26:21.261
because of solar degeneration. Light started 
breaking it down. You know, like, and I don't know

26:23.083 --> 26:25.086
whether, of course, with my background, I've had a 
lot of greenhouses with plastic on it. And one day

26:28.587 --> 26:33.914
you just start looking at it and it just totally 
comes apart. And that's what that was doing. So we

26:37.939 --> 26:54.921
started a project of using interlocking pavers, 
you know, no mortar just, and that helped because I

26:37.939 --> 26:54.921
kept wanting to try to get as much air and water down 
to those tree roots and let people across, you

26:37.939 --> 26:54.921
know, without creating any more compaction and, 
than necessary. I guess we finally got rid of most

26:58.155 --> 27:05.965
of the epoxy, had to, just because it finally 
started breaking up. Of course, somebody would

27:06.065 --> 27:10.551
get a vehicle up on it, and it was all broken up. But 
that was one I thought was a really good idea. And I

27:17.513 --> 27:26.471
think if it could have been kept in the shade and out 
of our intense sun, we'd have probably been OK. But

27:26.532 --> 27:34.909
there's enough late and early morning light that 
it just started breaking. And it all started

27:34.989 --> 27:36.973
happening. within probably that all that was done 
in 70 74 5 and 6 and by 79 about three or four years and

27:38.033 --> 28:02.184
the areas of the real intense shade it lasted the 
longest so and that's what Goldwater and I came up

27:38.033 --> 28:02.184
with that it was a solar breakdown you know that it 
just uh it just started coming apart. I've always

28:02.945 --> 28:05.728
liked when I go to the University of North Carolina 
many, many of their sidewalks, I'll call them, are

28:06.670 --> 28:12.258
unmortared brick. They tamp the sand underneath 
it. They lay the bricks down as tree roots. Oh,

28:17.145 --> 28:17.466
yeah. They can come and go. And then if they need to 
move the sidewalk, it's an instant thing. See,

28:22.994 --> 28:34.230
what I tried to get going, after we started using 
the interlocking pavers, modular paving, and I

28:22.994 --> 28:34.230
tried to get... I guess with Joe Estill, in a 
utility break, instead of going back with poured

28:36.252 --> 28:45.418
concrete, use a gray interlocking paper you know 
and uh I mean because they can take those things and

28:46.057 --> 29:07.845
they've got them they've got them at DFW airport 
that all those big jets run on and all like this and

28:46.057 --> 29:07.845
it's on uh on uh granular road base you know granted 
but uh They'll take an immense amount of traffic if

29:07.825 --> 29:11.671
they're properly based. And I think they're a 
wonderful thing. And I tried my best on the MSC

29:16.738 --> 29:29.677
thing to get the architects to consider doing 
something in that big plaza out there, you know,

29:16.738 --> 29:29.677
around the fountain, the brown brick. I said, do 
something with some different colors and

29:30.197 --> 29:33.903
patterns and all like this. I said, it's going to 
look like a roof scape. I was right but the

29:37.897 --> 30:01.744
architect and I had so many confrontations over 
trees that the last couple reviews I would walk in

29:37.897 --> 30:01.744
and he would leave I mean it just I just was a thorn in 
his side because I wouldn't he said well we'll just

29:37.897 --> 30:01.744
take this tree out and I said now wait a minute why 
are you taking this tree out and I finally got in,

30:02.213 --> 30:06.624
before I retired, I got in some trees over at Kyle 
Field. The engineering guy that David Gallagher,

30:07.406 --> 30:15.126
he came and he said, I've got a problem. Okay. Are 
you asking me questions? So we had a big tree that

30:18.954 --> 30:35.798
was going to be up against the face of the west end of 
the north side.

30:37.229 --> 30:46.951
So I told David, I said, well, let's hold out. We've 
got to save this.
