WEBVTT

00:02.410 --> 00:07.495
It's

00:02.410 --> 00:07.495
going. All right. I guess we'll start over again, 
because I don't think that one was working. And

00:13.721 --> 00:18.746
Mrs. Adams, you were telling me about going as a 
bride to Mexico. Well,

00:19.347 --> 00:25.573
my husband was superintendent of a mine up in the 
mountains. And it was a mine that was halfway

00:25.653 --> 00:31.759
between Saltillo and Monterey.

00:32.920 --> 00:36.584
about two miles off the railroad. And we only lived 
there a short time because the revolution came

00:36.604 --> 00:44.452
along and we had to leave. And then finally, we were 
in and out of Mexico for two or three years then. And

00:49.298 --> 00:56.305
that's how we came to live in San Antonio because 
this is our stopping place in between times. And we

00:57.827 --> 01:01.611
finally did go back to the mine And then Mr. Adams 
had a, let's see, he was transferred then over to

01:02.384 --> 01:13.862
Ahuela, which is near Torreón. He was with the 
Peñoles Mining Company. And it was from that mine

01:18.669 --> 01:23.937
up above Saltillo where The bandits came in and 
took him out and held him for five days, held him for

01:24.322 --> 01:31.029
a $25,000 ransom. That isn't much compared with 
what they get these days, but it was a great deal

01:31.830 --> 01:40.919
then. I was in Los Angeles at the time, and this was 
the... I just collected the... Those clippings

01:50.512 --> 01:55.483
had been laid away for, I guess, 50 years. And when 
we sold our home and moved into the apartment,

01:55.964 --> 02:00.795
these came to life. And so then I put them in a book 
and saved them. But they held him for five days out

02:04.383 --> 02:10.697
in the hill country. Finally, they paid the ransom 
and came back. It was a very pleasant experience

02:14.409 --> 02:16.492
for him. Nothing happened. They were very good to 
him. All they wanted was money for the revolution.

02:22.759 --> 02:25.182
What particular group of people? Well, they 
claimed to be Peroncistas at the time. That was

02:30.169 --> 02:33.072
when Carranza was in power. And when they came to 
rescue him, he said he was sleeping on a... on a

02:41.440 --> 02:49.210
blanket with a soldier on either side of them 
sleeping on their guns. And when the men came up the

02:49.911 --> 02:56.139
trail at 10 o'clock at night, one of them said, Kim 
Beebe, who comes? And one of them said, Carranza.

03:00.425 --> 03:01.867
And the other said, Villa. So they were evidently 
divided, you see. The men who were holding him

03:05.292 --> 03:10.198
claimed to be The men who were holding him came to be 
viestas and they arranged then for the ransom to be

03:10.364 --> 03:23.107
paid out of the, from the mining company office in 
Saltillo.

03:25.691 --> 03:26.693
He came out all right. He was only gone five days, 
but I was in Los Angeles and it was just, two months

03:33.398 --> 03:36.122
before my son was born. So I didn't meet any of these 
newspaper men. My father was an old newspaper man

03:42.391 --> 03:48.781
and he met them out on the porch of our home there in 
Los Angeles. My parents lived in Los Angeles. Of

03:54.070 --> 03:59.058
course, he was trying to fend off the reporters, 
and I wouldn't see them. So all of these things that

03:59.559 --> 04:07.551
were in these press notices were very disturbing 
to me because they were garbled, you know. And

04:08.353 --> 04:11.998
every time a newspaper would come out, I'd just go 
into hysterics. Well, when did you first hear that

04:12.840 --> 04:15.624
he'd been kidnapped? Well, I had... He was a 
very... almost providential thing because I took

04:20.598 --> 04:43.960
my daughter who was then four and went on the 
streetcar which was at 5th and 6th

04:20.598 --> 04:43.960
and Coronado and went down to the corner of 7th and 
Broadway on the streetcar. I was just getting out

04:43.980 --> 04:48.765
of home because I had had the flu the week before and 
I wanted to get out. And I heard these people

04:49.032 --> 04:56.603
calling the extras on the other two corners 
across. But I got off on this corner and walked

04:57.124 --> 05:03.434
directly across the street to get my bus back home. 
And they were calling all about the American

05:04.074 --> 05:07.800
kidnapped in Mexico. And it didn't down on me that 
it was my husband because they'd had so much

05:07.780 --> 05:16.492
trouble down around Fresnillo and the mines down 
there. And I just thought it was, just because it

05:17.073 --> 05:20.899
was Mexico, it was disturbing. And I got home and my 
father was out on the back porch just nervously

05:21.620 --> 05:28.770
looking at these newspapers. And I said, well, 
Dad, you might as well bring the papers in. I know

05:32.034 --> 05:34.598
about it already. Then I looked at the headlines 
and I said, well I didn't know it was my husband. And

05:40.587 --> 05:51.624
then of course I called the telegraph office, 
Western Union, and they said that they had had a

05:40.587 --> 05:51.624
consular message for me and they'd been trying to 
locate me. This was on a Monday. They'd been trying

05:53.106 --> 05:58.695
to locate me since

05:59.857 --> 06:00.478
Saturday. This didn't happen on Friday night. And 
because I was visiting my parents, who were named

06:03.021 --> 06:14.216
Adams, you see, they had, they had, they were named 
Kemp, and they were canvassing all the Adams in the

06:03.021 --> 06:14.216
directory. And so, of course, as soon as I 
identified myself, I got the message from the

06:22.030 --> 06:25.460
consulate in Saltia and from the mining company. 
It was the American Metals Company in New York. And

06:28.689 --> 06:32.219
I got my messages from them. They assured me that 
that was in here the They assured me that he was.

06:39.702 --> 06:40.603
This is the message. Your husband, held for ransom 
by Mexican rebels, have just received word he is

06:40.623 --> 06:47.655
being well treated. This office and the company 
doing everything possible to procure his

06:48.216 --> 06:52.222
release. And this was February 16, 1920. So this 
was actually rather late in the revolutionary

06:55.988 --> 06:59.854
period. Well, it was an interesting experience. 
He came out all right. There's never a time when

07:03.340 --> 07:08.387
it's very convenient to have a thing like that 
happen. Not exactly. No, I shouldn't think so.

07:11.171 --> 07:18.522
Well, when you were first down there, you were 
talking about going down to Mexico and your

07:11.171 --> 07:18.522
trousseau going by Ox Park. Now, when was that? 
Well, that was in 1918,

07:20.024 --> 07:28.656
I guess. My son was born in 1920, and this must have 
been 1916, because my

07:29.142 --> 07:43.906
daughter was two years old at the time. So it was 
very primitive at that time, of course, because we

07:45.148 --> 07:54.964
didn't even have the the highway between Monterey 
and Saltillo at that time. We could go from

07:58.739 --> 08:07.350
Monterey,

07:58.739 --> 08:07.350
we could go from the mine to Saltillo. We had a 
little Ford car. We could drive that to Saltillo.

08:11.955 --> 08:13.998
But to go to Monterey, we had to go on the train. And 
it only came lots of times. It was two days late

08:17.402 --> 08:18.984
coming through. So it was very primitive. Did you 
live at a mining camp or in a village? We lived in a

08:27.200 --> 08:35.674
mining camp, and there was no one there, but I went 
directly from Los Angeles, and I didn't know any

08:27.200 --> 08:35.674
Spanish at all. There were no other ladies in camp, 
and there was a sort of hotel for the bachelors. of

08:47.408 --> 09:01.132
workers and a Chinese cook, and they were down the 
hillside from our house, and we had this house up on

08:47.408 --> 09:01.132
the hillside, and a very nice, I think I have a 
picture of that.

09:08.765 --> 09:12.572
This

09:08.765 --> 09:12.572
was, this doesn't, do much for your recording. Oh, 
that's all right. It'll be fine in the transcript.

09:17.693 --> 09:21.317
Mary, you can look at it in just a moment. Why don't 
you go stand over here? Well, here is the Pancho

09:24.000 --> 09:26.383
Villa. Oh, this is Pancho Villa? Yes. He came in. He 
visited my husband several times at the, uh, this

09:29.266 --> 09:35.193
villa. Uh-huh. But he was at the smelter. You see, 
the mining camp This was down in Ahuela, near

09:40.075 --> 09:42.338
Torreon. This is the one near Torreon. But not 
where I live. Now, are you in this picture? No. This

09:50.186 --> 09:54.711
was taken down at the, not at the mine, but down at 
the smelt area. See, the mining company had the,

09:54.751 --> 10:04.442
this mine in Ahuela, where you are, is very 
interesting. It's a beautiful mountain country.

10:11.581 --> 10:14.425
What did your husband used to say about you? Did he 
talk about you much? Well, he was very, he came to

10:15.727 --> 10:21.034
call on my husband. He was in the hospital with an 
accident of mine.

10:33.451 --> 10:37.156
He was very, very agreeable when he came to call. Of 
course, you felt you had to handle him with gloves

10:37.176 --> 10:44.205
because he was supposed to be very temperamental, 
you know. So I guess everybody handled him very

10:44.665 --> 10:50.092
carefully, but he was very considerate. He came to 
call on Mr. Adams in the hospital

10:50.112 --> 11:00.285
and asked about his health, if they were taking 
care of him. But the houses at this mine are so

11:01.177 --> 11:06.534
interesting.

11:10.487 --> 11:11.490
The mining group. Were most of the miners North 
Americans? Well, this mining company that Mr.

11:17.439 --> 11:27.499
Adams was with was the Pinole's Mining Company, 
which was a Mexico division of the American Metal

11:17.439 --> 11:27.499
Company. And it, in turn, was a subdivision of the 
German Berlin Gasol shop. Of course that was, you

11:34.235 --> 11:37.160
see this is ancient history. That was 50, more than 
50 years ago. I can't believe sometimes it's that

11:42.731 --> 11:45.376
far back.

11:48.281 --> 11:54.032
This is the place where they had a strike and all the 
miners came out, see them on top of the building?

11:55.362 --> 11:57.906
Yeah, was there any trouble with strikes in the 
mine? Oh yes, we had numerous strikes. And in the

12:01.912 --> 12:10.844
morning, when Mr. Adams would get up and go down 
into the patio, our house was on the hillside,

12:01.912 --> 12:10.844
you'd look down into the patio. When I'd see these 
Serapis and Sombreros milling around the patio,

12:10.865 --> 12:19.497
then I'd know that there was a strike on, that they 
weren't going to work, you see. They had numerous,

12:19.477 --> 12:28.928
and they had old battles back and forth during the 
time. You see, Mexicans lived in these little,

12:28.988 --> 12:33.613
they called them cuevas. They would go to dig them 
back into the hillside where it was warm, you see,

12:34.034 --> 12:46.108
and have their sleeping quarters back in these 
cuevas, as they called them. Then they put a sort of

12:46.679 --> 12:53.369
a patio effect out in front, and when it was warm 
weather, they would live out in this patio. And

12:53.389 --> 12:56.153
when it was cold, they'd go back in the hillside. 
Very friendly. And these were the people that

12:57.395 --> 13:01.081
worked in the mines? Yes, yes, those were the 
workers. These were the ox kind.

13:08.071 --> 13:13.800
I wanted to show you that hillside, which shows all 
their houses, which I thought was very

13:08.071 --> 13:13.800
interesting. That's some of the workings in the 
mine.

13:21.054 --> 13:24.197
The battles, did you actually see any of the 
battles? No. See, most of the revolution was over

13:25.878 --> 13:31.784
by the time I went down there. We were married in, I 
don't know, I'll be able to tell you the date, but I

13:32.205 --> 13:39.852
always forget it. I think it was 1913.

13:45.303 --> 13:48.346
And my husband had gone down to Mexico. He 
graduated from Stanford. He worked for a little

13:51.448 --> 13:56.332
while for the Miami Copper Company in Arizona, and 
then he went to Mexico. And he came out, I remember,

13:57.213 --> 14:04.740
in 1910, when they had a revolution down there. 
They were always having a revolution, you know. It

14:08.023 --> 14:09.564
was a very mountainous country. This was the 
mining camp where he Is this the one in Torrey Yard?

14:18.589 --> 14:38.648
Well, no, this is there in Harris, where

14:18.589 --> 14:38.648
he had a mine, an accident in the mine, had a hole of 
rock hit him when he was, had knocked him down, had a

14:18.589 --> 14:38.648
fractured vertebra, and they carried him down 
this, on a, A very rude litter with a blanket, you

14:39.151 --> 14:43.822
know, with two sticks on either side. Mine was very 
high up. Yes. Well, he had a very checkered career.

14:53.073 --> 14:54.395
This was a bull fight. Now you say he had to leave or 
was it... Oh, there shows all the pot marks when

14:55.557 --> 15:03.811
they were taking and retaking this town of 
Torreon. Uh-huh. And the houses were just full of

15:05.093 --> 15:11.284
cannonballs and bullets and everything else. But 
did you all, until the bandits came, did you feel

15:11.264 --> 15:26.843
terribly threatened by any of the things that were 
going on, or did he, or did they pretty much leave

15:11.264 --> 15:26.843
him alone?

15:28.763 --> 15:33.147
You always had a, when you're young, you know, 
those things don't affect you very much. I guess we

15:33.267 --> 15:54.787
really felt a little uneasy all the time, because 
when I first went down there and Betty was a baby, I

15:33.267 --> 15:54.787
kept a little satchel packed with her baby food and 
her bottle and her diapers and all, so that if we had

15:33.267 --> 15:54.787
to get out on short notice, we could leave. And one 
night, this, we were, We had been told that the

15:59.510 --> 16:05.864
bandits were roving around the station, which was 
two miles down from the camp. And so we went to bed

16:06.986 --> 16:09.011
rather uneasy. And then there was a, we kept a 
watchman outside the house all night long. They

16:16.098 --> 16:33.837
had a system of alarms all over the camp, so that if 
there was a bandit alarm, he would ring on an old

16:16.098 --> 16:33.837
rail in the backyard, you know, soundless alarm, 
and the watchmen at the different levels over the

16:16.098 --> 16:33.837
mine would answer it, so that the whole camp would 
be alarmed. And in the middle of the night, he came

16:33.817 --> 16:39.886
to our window and he said, here they come, I'm in. 
And Mr. Adams asked, how many? And he said there

16:43.612 --> 16:47.557
were five bandits and they were on the trail back to 
our house. So Mr. Adams said, well, sound the

16:48.158 --> 16:50.221
alarm. So we heard him go back and sound this alarm. 
And we got into our clothes as quickly as we could,

16:54.067 --> 17:04.902
and I wrapped the baby in a blanket and got all ready 
to go down to the mine. And Mr. Adams took me down to

17:04.942 --> 17:10.649
the entrance of the mine. There was a little 
railroad that went into the entrance of the mine.

17:14.114 --> 17:24.480
And he left me there with the assistant 
superintendent, and he went back up the trail to

17:14.114 --> 17:24.480
wait for the bandits. And the three burros came 
down the trail.

17:36.085 --> 17:42.614
So

17:36.085 --> 17:42.614
it was much less threatening than it had appeared. 
We went through all the thrills, as it were.

17:48.743 --> 17:57.175
So we had a number of...

17:48.743 --> 17:57.175
What about the common people, the miners and 
people like that? Did they talk very much about

17:57.335 --> 18:02.683
what was going on, or were they very much afraid? 
Well, no, they were not. They were a very ignorant

18:04.841 --> 18:15.353
class, and all

18:04.841 --> 18:15.353
they wanted was a livelihood. They wanted the mine 
to continue and get their money. And of course, if

18:22.582 --> 18:25.465
they didn't

18:27.436 --> 18:35.325
That was their only means of support because there 
wasn't much agricultural pursuits around there.

18:35.346 --> 18:53.147
They had small ranches, but they were owned, you 
see, the ranches were owned by the money-class

18:35.346 --> 18:53.147
people, and these workmen could only get day's 
wages wherever they worked, you know. They didn't

18:53.167 --> 18:57.392
have much, much prospect of substantial living.

19:03.088 --> 19:08.076
And of course they, most of them, mining was all 
they knew. This was a lead and zinc and some silver

19:09.038 --> 19:15.668
mine. And they had, they brought it out on little, 
of course they had stoats in the mine where they

19:16.369 --> 19:26.164
knocked the ore down into these little carts. and 
they ran it out to the entrance of the mine in the

19:26.448 --> 19:47.190
carts, and then they loaded it onto a tramway, 
which was a system of trestles and buckets that ran

19:26.448 --> 19:47.190
down the mountainside, you see, and they The 
filled buckets, the weight of the filled buckets

19:48.824 --> 19:59.422
taking the ore down was sufficient to bring the 
empties back up, you see, on this tramway, they

19:48.824 --> 19:59.422
called it. That was interesting. I think that 
tramway is still there. You go on the railroad to,

20:04.531 --> 20:12.505
between Monterey and Saltillo, it's about 
halfway between Monterey and Saltillo. But

20:12.525 --> 20:13.887
the... The Mexican government has taken over all 
those mines now. They're government controlled.

20:20.576 --> 20:24.119
And I don't think that mine was good enough. It was 
rich enough that they probably aren't mining it at

20:24.859 --> 20:28.643
all now. But during the war days, you see this was 
during the war days that we were down there. And we

20:37.951 --> 20:44.076
had to get all our supplies through the American 
consulate in Monterey. I remember when we wanted,

20:44.647 --> 20:58.980
Betty had the lupine cough and we wanted, I wanted 
special food for her because she didn't seem to be

20:44.647 --> 20:58.980
able to take the food that we were giving her. I 
remember I was paying a dollar, a dollar and a half

21:00.282 --> 21:11.312
for a little can of the more than sweetened milk, 
you know. Condensed milk? Condensed milk, yes.

21:19.000 --> 21:23.929
But not the, it's the sweetened kind, you know. 
That seemed to be all sweetened. At one stage, we

21:26.734 --> 21:34.448
had a goat, and we gave her goat's milk, and they The 
Mexican people that you met down there were very

21:35.170 --> 21:52.232
friendly, and I remember this woman who lived over 
at the ranch that sent our vegetables in from the

21:35.170 --> 21:52.232
Jewish, and she had sent us milk, but we didn't have 
to boil it. Of course, it didn't do very well, but

21:52.252 --> 22:03.827
she said that the child should have goat's milk and 
have it warm right from the goat, And so the Mexican

22:03.976 --> 22:20.837
mozo, he'd come in and I'd have him scrub his hands 
in the kitchen, wash them very clean, and give him a

22:03.976 --> 22:20.837
little cup with a linen cloth to strain it through. 
And he would go up on the hillside and he'd milk the

22:20.897 --> 22:28.667
goat and strain it right into her cup and she'd 
drink it. Well, that was the thing that this

22:29.002 --> 22:35.493
Mexican woman told me. How did it work? It worked. 
It worked very well. Because we'd been having to

22:38.799 --> 22:52.242
send the secretary, a boy from his office by train 
down to Saltillo to bring the milk back, you see. So

22:53.352 --> 22:55.680
this didn't work very well. But we had a number of 
very primitive experiences down there. It seems

23:02.093 --> 23:06.719
so long ago, I haven't talked about it for so long, 
it's hard to remember. Do you remember

23:09.142 --> 23:14.468
approximately what the miners made each day for 
their labor? I just don't know what the prices

23:15.209 --> 23:19.915
were. Of course, they were paid in Mexican 
currency.

23:25.062 --> 23:26.143
Right.

23:28.418 --> 23:32.108
I think the ratio was two to one at that time. Of 
course, that has changed a good many times, you

23:32.990 --> 23:37.943
know. Then at one time, when Mr. Adams was 
kidnapped by these bandits up above Saltea, He

23:46.036 --> 23:47.578
wasn't paying them. He was paying them in script, 
which they'd have to take down into the city to get

23:47.598 --> 24:01.152
cashed, because he didn't dare keep money at the 
mine. And that was the reason, really, they took

24:01.853 --> 24:09.101
him out when they kidnapped him, was because they 
asked for money, and he said he didn't have any

24:01.853 --> 24:09.101
money. And because he was paying in script, And so 
they said, well, we'll have to take you with us

24:14.318 --> 24:18.703
until we get our money back. And that's how they did 
it. Was this a regular point? Did the bandits do

24:26.291 --> 24:28.333
this regularly? Was it something to be expected? I 
mean, were the bandits kidnapping people for

24:31.537 --> 24:37.343
money during this period? Well, this happened. 
There had been a good many kidnappings about that

24:39.749 --> 25:04.896
time, and I think one of these clippings in here 
tells about how Villa had said that he was going to

24:39.749 --> 25:04.896
capture 12 Americans, and until he got his money 
back, Villa claimed that he had sent his

25:06.597 --> 25:25.055
representative up with money to buy supplies, and 
the man had absconded with the money, and he said

25:06.597 --> 25:25.055
that until he got his money back, he was going to 
kidnap Americans and hold them until he was

25:06.597 --> 25:25.055
reimbursed. Now, this was actually after 
Pershing had left Mexico, wasn't it? Yes. Yes. So V

25:36.857 --> 25:40.021
was still actively... But you say these men did not 
claim to be V. Eustace. Well, the men that...

25:53.659 --> 25:58.705
The men that took him out claimed to be V. Eustace. 
They were all... I think there were about 12 men,

26:00.748 --> 26:04.853
and they all seemed to have... colonel status. 
Twelve colonels? My goodness. They were all

26:08.261 --> 26:09.642
colonels. And one of them even was a mason. This was 
very queer. Was

26:14.949 --> 26:23.599
your husband a mason too? No. Well, no. His father 
had been a mason. Mr. Adams went to Mexico as a young

26:27.123 --> 26:34.232
high engineer right out of college and never had 
taken up, he really never had settled himself any

26:35.545 --> 26:40.977
place to be affiliated. His father had been a 
nation. The men that held him, were they Did he

26:48.303 --> 26:51.128
describe them as being fairly well educated? They 
were all fairly well educated. They were not the

26:53.894 --> 26:59.244
class of men that he'd been working with in the mine 
at all. And he said that as they

27:00.265 --> 27:09.062
gave him a horse to ride,

27:10.173 --> 27:16.583
He said as they rode, they could see the Federal 
troops in the distance, but they never caught up

27:10.173 --> 27:16.583
with them. He said they didn't try. The Federal 
troops were supposed to be out trying to locate

27:18.626 --> 27:24.896
them, you see. And he said they could see them as 
they were driving, riding along, and they would

27:24.916 --> 27:36.113
camp at the different, well I guess common, just 
commandeered Any ramps they came to, they would

27:36.498 --> 27:43.977
just require them to feed them and feed their 
horses. But they rode over the hills for five days.

27:59.178 --> 28:01.441
Did he ever hear from any of these men later? Did he 
ever find out what happened to them? No. The man who

28:04.885 --> 28:25.350
came to rescue him was, had been at one time, his 
name was Gutierrez, and he had been one of those

28:04.885 --> 28:25.350
interim presidents, well, president probably 
for a day or a very short period at one time in

28:04.885 --> 28:25.350
Mexico. And when he came, he came out to to rescue 
the saddles. And he simply gave his word to the

28:32.619 --> 28:40.569
bandits that he would bring them their army. So he 
acted as a go-between. And they released your

28:44.774 --> 28:49.360
husband before they had the money? Yes. But this 
man Gutierrez, of course, we've always thought

28:51.422 --> 28:57.670
that he was in on them. because he merely gave them 
his word that the money would be paid to them. And I

29:07.274 --> 29:14.445
think he went into the office in Saltillo and 
collected the money and took it out to them. Very

29:14.465 --> 29:15.186
simple. But it was just one of those things. This is 
the mountains there.

29:32.868 --> 29:45.644
When we moved and I discovered these, I knew these 
clippings were there in a box of papers and all the

29:32.868 --> 29:45.644
shadows had. But my son, who was born just after 
this kidnapping, had never seen them until we

29:46.144 --> 29:55.716
moved about four years ago. So it was very 
interesting to him and his family. Two of his

29:59.160 --> 30:02.284
children were up here with him the night We were 
looking for the

30:03.530 --> 30:19.593
release papers on the property we were selling and 
had to have an abstract that had not been filed and

30:03.530 --> 30:19.593
should have been.

30:19.613 --> 30:23.038
So we found all these clippings. Did your husband 
ever go back to Mexico after? Yes, we went back to

30:27.931 --> 30:38.562
Mexico, and we lived in Monterey after that, and he 
was Assistant General . And then they had a very,

30:38.582 --> 30:51.074
well, they had a general shakeup in the 
administration, and a good many of the old

30:38.582 --> 30:51.074
employees left. And we came up here and went into 
the packing house business with friends, and

30:51.094 --> 30:57.921
spent 30 years in that. About what year was it that 
you came here? Well, we came up in 21, about a year

31:01.838 --> 31:10.926
after

31:01.838 --> 31:10.926
this event. We came up in 21, so we've been living in 
San Antonio since 1921. That book needs repair.

31:17.212 --> 31:20.334
It's home to pieces. Yes, it has. That was his track 
suit there in Stanford. My friends always said his

31:27.415 --> 31:36.128
middle name was Billy Stanford Adams.

31:36.148 --> 31:43.780
Well, did your husband ever comment about, since 
he saw so much of the Revolution, did he have any

31:36.148 --> 31:43.780
opinions about it? Did he ever talk much about 
whether he thought it was worthwhile or just a

31:45.382 --> 31:55.718
waste of time? The Mexican governments, you know, 
have been so...

31:56.423 --> 32:12.484
One regime will go along easily, you know, and then 
the next one comes along and it's completely over.

32:13.265 --> 32:18.151
It's just a series of that sort of thing. And of 
course, during the time that he was down there, it

32:18.212 --> 32:23.899
was all so... revolutionary, you know.

32:30.736 --> 32:33.081
Not nearly as stable as it is now. Of course, they 
say it isn't too good, but it's a lot more stable

32:33.101 --> 32:38.551
than it was then. At least they have a set 
government now that seems to work.

32:54.507 --> 33:00.015
Did you get to know any of the Mexican women? Well, 
you see, when I was down there, we were out in the,

33:00.035 --> 33:16.218
out at this little mining camp, and my only 
connection was with the ranch people that came in,

33:00.035 --> 33:16.218
and with the miners' families. You know, the 
master mechanic down there was a very nice

33:16.759 --> 33:24.109
Mexican, and very capable. I went down to Frank 
Brothers to buy some shoes not long ago, and the

33:25.456 --> 33:37.391
clerk that was waiting down there came with 
Medellin, and I said, did you happen to come from

33:25.456 --> 33:37.391
the Medellin family in the garrison? He said, yes, 
that was my father. Wasn't that queer? How did he

33:42.757 --> 33:44.059
happen to come? Well, I think the whole family came 
up here, and they were living out on the... I knew of

33:50.287 --> 33:52.670
them, and I knew when they came. I mean, I... Mr. 
Adams had known of their being here, and that the

33:54.025 --> 33:59.271
whole family came up here. He was a good mechanic. 
Of course, I don't know of what sort of, you say he

34:01.554 --> 34:12.967
would have in, in, in locating here, but he 
evidently managed to. And then when my daughter

34:15.349 --> 34:20.235
came, was married, she, married a young lawyer 
here in San Antonio, and never had any idea of going

34:21.093 --> 34:27.542
to Mexico. Of course, she had learned Spanish 
before she learned English from the nurse down

34:27.622 --> 34:34.712
that we had for her. She was four or five when we left 
Mexico.

34:42.122 --> 34:45.767
And her husband had grown up in Brownsville, And he 
spoke excellent Spanish. He was a graduate of

34:48.955 --> 34:53.641
Suwannee and of the University of Texas. And he was 
one of the young lawyers that was chosen to go into

34:53.661 --> 35:03.714
the auxiliary service for the embassy in Mexico 
City. So he served as an auxiliary officer at the

35:04.335 --> 35:09.881
embassy in Mexico City. And they lived down there 
for three years. And then he went on to Washington.

35:18.130 --> 35:29.228
He went to Houston first with the law firm there, 
and then he went on to Washington as the Assistant

35:18.130 --> 35:29.228
Secretary for Latin America. What is his name? 
Collin. Henry Collin.

35:38.604 --> 35:41.168
They had a very interesting experience. three 
years at the embassy

35:41.587 --> 35:46.031
in Mexico City. In fact, Henry spoke such good 
Spanish, that was when Mr. Messerschmitt was the

35:46.051 --> 35:55.241
ambassador

35:46.051 --> 35:55.241
in Mexico. Henry spoke such good Spanish that he 
did all of the public appearances in the hospital

35:55.281 --> 36:11.577
that he sort of pinched him and told him when he had 
his Spanish.

36:12.130 --> 36:13.291
Oh, excuse me. It was a very interesting life for 
them. I'm curious, did you ever hear from

36:16.114 --> 36:19.918
Gutierrez again? Did your husband ever hear from 
any of these people that had kidnapped him later

36:19.938 --> 36:24.402
on? Or hear what happened to him? No, I don't think 
he ever did.

36:35.033 --> 36:37.716
I never thought about that. I think perhaps they 
just melted into the, they took their money and

36:38.084 --> 36:43.094
ran. Because that was all, that was all they 
wanted. There was nothing, it wasn't anything

36:46.962 --> 36:49.628
personal. They had no... a particular claim 
against him, they just wanted their money, and he

36:52.073 --> 37:07.211
said in this write-up in his book, he said they 
apologized any number of times for taking him out

36:52.073 --> 37:07.211
if they did. They were very, very polite and very 
solicitous for his comfort. Of course, they said

37:12.517 --> 37:15.921
they had to have their money. They knew they would 
get it. They knew that the mining company would pay

37:17.655 --> 37:21.300
it because they paid it for other men. They had 
taken other men out. I think the superintendent of

37:24.185 --> 37:34.801
the smelter had been taken out to the health events 
and the mining company had paid it. So it wasn't an

37:34.821 --> 37:40.269
uncommon experience. Was anyone ever killed? by 
this particular group of men? No, I don't think so.

37:45.963 --> 37:49.995
They were not violent men. They just needed money 
for the revolution, like I said.

37:57.683 --> 38:00.688
Five days on horseback. Was your husband 
accustomed to riding horseback? No. He had a free

38:06.379 --> 38:09.645
saddle sword at the end of that five-day. Well, he 
never complained. He said it was a nice horse, and

38:12.089 --> 38:21.987
they promised to give him a horse, but they never 
did.

38:23.789 --> 38:41.258
They just traveled around, and really it was an 
area not far from this mine, because they doubled

38:23.789 --> 38:41.258
back to the mine finally to get,

38:23.789 --> 38:41.258
I don't know, six or seven supplies, or I'm sorry to 
say that. It almost seems this would be gasoline

38:41.508 --> 38:48.079
because

38:41.508 --> 38:48.079
it wasn't. We had that little Ford car at that time 
that we used to go back and forth two miles from the

38:48.099 --> 39:01.542
mine down to the station.

39:02.804 --> 39:10.732
Of course, at this other mine where he was taken, 
where he was kidnapped, it was even off the

39:02.804 --> 39:10.732
narrow-gauge railway. You had to go by muleback 
for a couple of miles to get up there. It was very

39:15.497 --> 39:17.580
isolated. And I guess that was the reason they 
dared come in there and take him, because it was off

39:17.600 --> 39:28.511
the line of communication.

39:28.531 --> 39:29.352
Things were... It was interesting at the time. I 
wouldn't want to do it now. It sounds like you've

39:35.258 --> 39:40.847
had a lot of very interesting experiences. Well, 
it was interesting at the time. Of course, I didn't

39:46.356 --> 39:49.982
think about it at the time. It was very foreign to my 
experience because I had grown up while I was

39:50.002 --> 39:58.275
teaching in Los Angeles at the time we met. I had 
never been to Texas or Mexico. I'd gone to New York

40:06.293 --> 40:16.225
and traveled from Los Angeles to New York and 
Virginia and the east, but I'd never been south. So

40:17.627 --> 40:19.469
it was all new to me. I knew no Spanish. So I learned 
my Spanish by the hand and foot method. When you

40:27.140 --> 40:33.368
came to San Antonio, did you make your friends 
among the people that had lived in Mexico? Yes,

40:34.109 --> 40:38.996
many of our friends were people who had lived in 
Mexico. We still have the nucleus of those

40:39.016 --> 40:42.000
friends. There are lots of people in San Antonio 
who have lived in Mexico at one time or another.

40:49.319 --> 40:50.662
still find a new case. And a good many of the, of 
these men who left the mining business about the

40:50.762 --> 41:07.834
same time as Travis did were, some of them settled 
here, and some were in Denver, and he was Why do you

41:09.569 --> 41:14.194
think so many people left that business right at 
that particular time? Well, it was an aftermath of

41:14.214 --> 41:21.062
the war, a reorganization of the company. It was 
largely German-dominated. All the head men were

41:27.009 --> 41:32.495
prominent Germans. And I think it was an aftermath 
of the war at that time. Well, now, how did that work

41:37.521 --> 41:39.103
out? During that time period, we were at war with 
Germany. Were there any complications? Well,

41:46.404 --> 41:48.887
yes. I can't quite remember.

41:53.674 --> 42:03.349
All the mining interests were taken over by the 
government

41:53.674 --> 42:03.349
because they were German interests. Right. And I 
don't know just how that was... Of course, this

42:07.501 --> 42:21.742
company that Mr. Evans was employed by was the 
American Metals Company, but it was owned by the

42:07.501 --> 42:21.742
German interests, and all the head men who came 
down to the mine were German. But it was taken over

42:23.525 --> 42:26.669
by the government at that time. By the United 
States government? The United States

42:28.952 --> 42:32.057
government, yes. Were there any mining engineers 
from other countries besides the United States

42:32.628 --> 42:40.581
down there? Oh yes, there were very many of them. In 
fact, Mr. Adams' first mine superintendent was an

42:42.825 --> 42:51.619
Englishman, Mr. Gluck. He was an Englishman, but 
he was working for this German company. And we had,

42:57.467 --> 43:02.776
it was, probably had quite a few Germans working 
for them. It was not entirely German. It was,

43:06.562 --> 43:15.395
several of the men I picked up were English, and a 
good many of them were American mining men,

43:06.562 --> 43:15.395
because I can't remember them all. Were any of them 
Italians? No. I don't remember any Italians in the

43:19.061 --> 43:21.545
organization. There were Germans, and there were 
Swiss, What about Mexicans? Were there any

43:26.269 --> 43:32.277
Mexicans in the supervisory positions? Not in the 
head positions. I can't

43:34.139 --> 43:54.306
remember of any of the

43:34.139 --> 43:54.306
officials being Mexicans. Of course, there was a 
large, in Monterey, when we were living down

43:55.585 --> 44:09.641
there, there was a large colony of German settlers 
down there, quite a large group. In fact, they had a

44:09.742 --> 44:13.806
German foreign club.

44:17.711 --> 44:22.977
I remember so distinctly when I, when Mr. Adams had 
this accident over at the mine, And we went to

44:23.767 --> 44:25.769
Monterey. He was in the hospital there. And we were 
moving at that time from one station to another.

44:33.776 --> 44:37.820
And I needed to buy some pajamas. And my Spanish was 
very, very poor. And I went into a men's clothing

44:41.263 --> 44:46.048
firm there in Monterey. And in my very poor 
Spanish, I told him I wanted sleeping garments. I

44:51.553 --> 44:53.655
wanted two-piece sleeping garments. This is a 
very small man that came away on a small stature and

44:53.956 --> 45:03.306
rather a dark complexion. I took him for a Mexican. 
And in my terrible Spanish, I explained what I

45:05.869 --> 45:11.815
wanted, and he answered me in perfect English. And 
he was a Frenchman and president of the foreign

45:13.497 --> 45:17.781
club. And I said, why did you let me struggle along 
with my terrible Spanish? He said, it was such fun

45:23.386 --> 45:25.748
to hear you.

45:30.833 --> 45:36.899
So that was the year we went. After he got out of the 
hospital, we went back to Monterey and spent the

45:36.919 --> 45:41.243
year there. And then we left. Did you know of many 
Mexican families that left Mexico during this

45:44.487 --> 45:51.013
period or earlier, during the Revolutionary 
period? Well, I didn't happen to know them.

45:55.666 --> 46:00.778
Because if I say we were living in the country, you 
know, at this mining camp. And the miners

46:00.798 --> 46:04.346
themselves, were they pretty well staying? Well, 
they were pretty... Well, they were so poor, you

46:06.451 --> 46:10.917
know, they couldn't go any place. They had to stay 
right there. I meant to ask, did they actually,

46:13.020 --> 46:19.969
they with their families, live up at the mine, or 
did they live down on their ranches? Oh, no, these

46:20.370 --> 46:24.796
men that worked in the mine lived right there at the 
mine. With their families? Yes, with their

46:26.698 --> 46:28.060
families. And they were, that was their home. They 
had no other home to go to. Of course, I suppose when

46:33.991 --> 46:49.164
the mine closed down, they spread out in the 
country and probably lived with relatives or got

46:33.991 --> 46:49.164
jobs on ranches and wherever they could or went to 
another mine. Of course, there were lots of mines

46:49.685 --> 46:53.888
in Mexico. This was one of the rather smaller mines 
there. The larger mine over in Torreon was There

47:04.720 --> 47:15.791
were several thousand there around your town, but 
this was just a little mining camp, which was very

47:04.720 --> 47:15.791
poor. Did most of the men have wives and children, 
huh? Yes. Yes, there were lots of wives and

47:19.815 --> 47:26.281
children at the camp, and they seemed to be a very 
happy bunch. They had their own little market,

47:26.641 --> 47:32.787
and...

47:33.408 --> 47:35.550
have their little carnivals and all.

47:38.894 --> 47:43.058
Were they all from that part of Mexico, or were they 
from different parts of Mexico? No, I think they

47:43.118 --> 47:56.632
were pretty much from that district, right around 
here, about several generations back had worked

47:43.118 --> 47:56.632
on this, in the mines around. Of course, that was 
their profession, mining. And it was really very

48:00.003 --> 48:04.229
dangerous because it was primitive, you know. 
They had these stoats in the mine where they'd go up

48:04.269 --> 48:27.462
what they called chicken ladders, you know, to go 
to the top of the stoat, you know, and dig the ore out

48:04.269 --> 48:27.462
and throw it down, you see, into these parts on this 
little railroad. very primitive and very

48:27.813 --> 48:49.264
dangerous they had lots of accidents what did they 
do mine no it was lead and silver with a lead and zinc

48:27.813 --> 48:49.264
and some silver but uh about when had it been open my 
husband go down to open it oh no no it was an old mine

48:27.813 --> 48:49.264
was in i don't know how there were two mines there in 
fact one was the cabrillas line and the other was

48:50.037 --> 49:16.703
over the mountain the garris mine but there were 
two mines there but the main mine was where we were

48:50.037 --> 49:16.703
where our camp was and we had a very nice brick house 
built on the hillside we had a had to have a watch

48:50.037 --> 49:16.703
from there day and night because There was a trail 
right back of the house that led over the

49:17.459 --> 49:26.312
mountains, and that's where the milk pen came in.

49:26.332 --> 49:33.123
And then there was usually, there was this road 
down, sort of follows the railroad track there.

49:36.308 --> 49:46.403
And we often had, that's where the train master 
down at the station would come up and tell us that

49:36.308 --> 49:46.403
the bandits were milling around the railroad 
station. Unless they had some particular

49:47.092 --> 49:53.224
objective, they didn't come up to the camp. Your 
miners, did any of them go down and join any of the

49:55.809 --> 50:02.922
revolutionary groups, or would you have heard 
about that? Well, we wouldn't have heard about it.

50:06.049 --> 50:08.914
They may have, but... Of course, when they went on 
strike, what they wanted was their money. They

50:16.163 --> 50:21.731
wanted more money, might

50:16.163 --> 50:21.731
I say. What did you do when they went on strike? Did 
they get more money, or what? Well, they had to

50:26.559 --> 50:32.347
negotiate with them, just like they do now. I 
suppose I really didn't enter into that, so I

50:33.409 --> 50:38.597
really don't know. Eventually they'd go back to 
work, and I suppose the mining company would agree

50:39.185 --> 50:48.098
to meet their terms or whatever they...

50:50.626 --> 50:52.429
You mentioned a lot of accidents. What did these 
people do when somebody had been injured in an

50:52.730 --> 50:56.837
accident? Well, they had a doctor there. They had a 
doctor. He was very poor. Of course, he met their

51:00.563 --> 51:02.246
needs. And then, of course, the company had a 
Canadian doctor in Monterey, which they would

51:02.747 --> 51:08.977
send that. And the staff had this accident, which 
was fine. They sent the Canadian doctor down. In

51:15.579 --> 51:18.542
fact, the other company had their own rolling 
stock. They had an engine and a car, too. They

51:25.289 --> 51:35.940
called it the side door Pullman because it was a 
boxcar that made over into

51:25.289 --> 51:35.940
a Pullman. They eventually did have a Pullman car. 
But when we first went down there, it was the boxcar

51:39.123 --> 51:43.347
with the living quarters in it. They thought that 
the hill was special.

51:51.475 --> 51:59.104
Did you learn that the Mexican women had quite a bit 
of medical lore? Well, yes. It's a good hill like

52:01.186 --> 52:04.530
the Mexicans are here, you know. They always, they 
have their,

52:04.550 --> 52:12.439
I've forgotten what they call them, the women who 
They really do an awful lot of doctoring before

52:12.723 --> 52:21.657
they call in a medical doctor.

52:21.677 --> 52:23.219
Old remedies, I suppose. Did you ever use any of 
them? No, I never did. Except the goat. Well, the

52:30.511 --> 52:31.032
goat. Yes, I used the goat. But it was a... I... I 
remember several times when we were invited over

52:40.600 --> 52:58.227
to this ranch place for a meal, and how very 
courteous, and I know they just were convulsed by

52:40.600 --> 52:58.227
Spanish, but you could see they were amused, but 
they weren't just courteous at all. And of course,

52:59.469 --> 53:03.174
there's so many words infused with Spanish. 
There's so many words, you know, that...

53:08.123 --> 53:16.356
confusing because they have the same word, they 
have several different words for the same object.

53:16.376 --> 53:30.638
For instance, my little daughter, I've heard the 
word down there for umbrella, sombria, and she

53:16.376 --> 53:30.638
came up here and they called it a parasol and an 
umbrella, so she called it a sombrelasol.

53:33.318 --> 53:37.303
The people that owned this ranch, these were the 
owners of the ranch? Yes, they owned the ranch.

53:41.388 --> 53:44.491
They weren't the same class as the miners? No, and 
there's really a caste system down there. They

53:48.957 --> 54:02.413
felt very superior to the working, and they feel 
very superior to the hired hands that they have to

53:48.957 --> 54:02.413
do the manual labor on. on the ranches so there's 
really quite a feeling of aristocracy about it

54:03.490 --> 54:31.827
they were very early i i enjoyed the contact down

54:03.490 --> 54:31.827
there your pleasures were very simple did they uh 
well uh i don't remember ever entertaining them a

54:31.958 --> 54:34.901
meal or anything. But no, I don't think they did. 
They did come over to, she would send her mosso

54:38.204 --> 54:46.933
over, you see, for a pile. We didn't have a water 
supply. And they had to send the water over in jugs,

54:49.515 --> 54:57.683
two big jugs on either side of the boiler. And of 
course we boiled the water. And then the

55:00.766 --> 55:01.847
vegetables.
