00:01.415 --> 00:07.184
Dr. Bain, assistant administrator of the Texas 
Engineering Experiment Station. Today's date is

00:07.885 --> 00:10.690
July 16, 1981. Dr. Bain, could you tell us 
something about your early years? I'd be happy to.

00:20.806 --> 00:27.777
First of all, I'm assistant director of the 
Engineering Experiment Station, not assistant

00:20.806 --> 00:27.777
administrator.

00:29.275 --> 00:36.344
Well, I was born in San Antonio, Texas,

00:29.275 --> 00:36.344
March 20, 1921.

00:38.587 --> 00:40.550
My father was an architect. My mother

00:42.031 --> 00:49.461
came from a very prominent family. in the sense of 
literary accomplishments. My grandfather was a

00:52.510 --> 01:06.908
member of the Omar Khayyam Club of America and 
translated the Rubaiyat and the Iblis and

00:52.510 --> 01:06.908
Paradise and Kohilith and a few other of the 
Persian writings of some of the ancient scholars.

01:09.392 --> 01:12.416
I had a very fine childhood. One brother, a younger 
brother, who grew up to be my big brother, about

01:19.732 --> 01:39.833
five four inches taller than i am but that didn't 
give me a small man complex at all i went to agnes

01:19.732 --> 01:39.833
cotton for the first parts of my schooling to mark 
twain junior high school and the thomas jefferson

01:19.732 --> 01:39.833
high school which we considered to be one of the 
foremost high schools in San Antonio at that time.

01:44.853 --> 01:51.544
A lot of school spirit and a very social group, and 
yet professional in every way. I had a lot of high

01:52.486 --> 01:54.870
regard for my teachers. Mr. May, who was my physics 
and chemistry teacher, probably helped guide me

01:54.890 --> 02:05.888
into engineering. Mrs. Mary Hickman, my algebra 
teacher, likewise had highest regards for them. I

02:13.764 --> 02:16.166
did very well in high school. I was an ROTC there and 
was the company commander and had a pretty little

02:17.928 --> 02:31.840
sponsor to march along with me in the Battle of 
Flowers parades and to go on various functions and

02:17.928 --> 02:31.840
that sort of thing. We

02:31.860 --> 02:36.364
weathered the Depression. And my father had to 
transfer out of San Antonio because of the

02:37.593 --> 02:43.963
Depression. But nonetheless, being good 
managers, he weathered that and got into the

02:44.003 --> 03:03.533
bookstore business, which was the same type of 
business that my grandfather, George Rowe, was in

02:44.003 --> 03:03.533
since early 1900s in San Antonio.

03:04.795 --> 03:08.120
As I said, I graduated from Thomas Jefferson High 
School. I wanted to be an engineer from the

03:09.602 --> 03:26.145
beginning because of my teachers and also because 
of an uncle, Peter Henry Rowe, who graduated from

03:09.602 --> 03:26.145
Texas A&M in 1917.

03:27.374 --> 03:39.207
He was a product of Frank Bolton, who was an eminent 
electrical engineer at Texas A&M and later became

03:27.374 --> 03:39.207
president, I think, of Texas A&M University. So 
the choices for my future were not as great as they

03:39.687 --> 03:47.555
are today for young people. The alternatives were 
not as great. Engineering was my selected field. I

03:54.824 --> 04:01.630
had an ambition to be a good engineer, to graduate 
and to get married and to raise a family. So my

04:02.351 --> 04:09.818
objectives were rather straightforward and not 
cluttered by a lot of alternatives, as I said. I

04:09.838 --> 04:19.487
think that the young people today are faced with so 
many alternatives that it makes them somewhat

04:09.838 --> 04:19.487
confused as to what their objectives in life are. 
Is that the kind of... Yes, sir. Very good. Could

04:23.338 --> 04:31.848
you tell... Dr. Bank, could you tell us a little bit 
more about how the Depression affected your

04:23.338 --> 04:31.848
family? My father had to transfer from San Antonio 
to an architectural firm in Henderson, Texas.

04:41.240 --> 04:47.348
The family moved there for one summer, and...

04:48.121 --> 04:55.134
Because my mother was born in San Antonio and her 
friends were there, she would not transfer

04:48.121 --> 04:55.134
permanently. So she moved back to San Antonio with 
her two boys. And my father had to follow because he

04:59.462 --> 05:07.497
didn't want to live 300 miles or thereabouts from 
his family. He had to leave his profession and

05:08.084 --> 05:18.957
change professions and went into the used book 
business and the new book business also in San

05:08.084 --> 05:18.957
Antonio. His bookstore was on West Houston 
Street. He did a good job. He was a fine father. And

05:27.187 --> 05:30.231
he and my mother fought quite a bit. And I guess that 
helped me make a decision to have a more happy

05:30.732 --> 05:36.859
married life and family life. But it was rather 
traumatic at the time because he had to move back to

05:37.615 --> 05:43.383
and leave his profession. As a boy growing up in the 
Depression, how did you or did you look upon

05:44.124 --> 05:49.951
Franklin Roosevelt and the New Deal? Well, I felt 
that the food lines were deplorable. I felt that

05:58.222 --> 06:01.767
the fact that Franklin Roosevelt came to the 
rescue of the country and came up with a new deal

06:02.033 --> 06:23.783
that helped spread the resources of the country 
was a heck of a lot better than seeing piles of

06:02.033 --> 06:23.783
vegetables in the Rio Grande Valley just rotting 
alongside of the roads because of non-government

06:02.033 --> 06:23.783
action to distribute those food products. That 
was a crime that should never happen again. part of

06:28.358 --> 06:32.282
the country in food lines and undernourished. And 
the Rio Grande Valley, the vegetable capital at

06:32.362 --> 06:48.779
that time, I guess, next to California, had piles 
of vegetables everywhere just absolutely

06:32.362 --> 06:48.779
rotting along side of the road because they 
couldn't sell their product. The government

06:48.799 --> 06:50.080
should have stepped in. I think Franklin 
Roosevelt did a good thing. There was a lot of

06:53.684 --> 06:57.488
controversy about Eleanor and her Eleanor clubs. 
in her efforts to do away with racial

06:58.042 --> 07:08.502
discrimination, but that was also for the best of 
the country. We can't have a poverty part of the

07:09.524 --> 07:14.534
country or a poverty part of the society. We must 
have a good opportunity for all Americans. I do not

07:20.806 --> 07:25.090
think also that we can have good economy in one part 
of the world. I think that we cannot live unto

07:25.210 --> 07:29.834
ourselves. We must share the responsibilities 
for the economy of the world.

07:37.181 --> 07:43.407
Dr. Bank, could you tell us when you first came to 
Texas A&M as a student in engineering? Well, I came

07:45.048 --> 07:50.053
to Texas A&M in the fall of 1939.

07:50.692 --> 08:07.062
I had a footlocker and a suitcase and I was told the 
room that I would be in and that I could haul my

07:50.692 --> 08:07.062
footlocker up there and my suitcase and then I 
could come down and get to work. At that time, Fish

08:09.220 --> 08:18.931
Bain worked like heck in hauling the personal 
belongings of the upperclassmen to their rooms.

08:20.253 --> 08:21.735
He had to clean their rooms. He had to do a lot of 
things as a freshman at A&M that is not required

08:21.775 --> 08:30.705
now. were in some ways a personal servant to an 
upperclassman. You would bring his breakfast

08:36.255 --> 08:38.680
from the mess hall. Of course, that was illegal, 
but that sort of thing was done. It was not a major

08:43.692 --> 08:47.901
violation of anything, but you'd bring a a half 
pint of milk and some fruit or a sweet roll in your

08:48.252 --> 09:01.312
socks under your pants as you came from the mess 
hall so that the upperclassman could have his

08:48.252 --> 09:01.312
breakfast before going to his 8 o'clock class. We 
developed a lot of camaraderie in our freshman

09:03.135 --> 09:15.795
class and that was the purpose of the ROTC system 
here at A&M, to develop long-term ties to develop

09:16.838 --> 09:30.739
friends who will assist you in the future and you in 
turn can help them. I think the system is great. I

09:32.602 --> 09:42.758
hope the changes in that line have not been to the 
detriment of the system, to the detriment of A&M

09:32.602 --> 09:42.758
and its graduates. But this is a changing world and 
So in 1957, I guess, the mandatory ROTC went away.

09:53.119 --> 09:58.627
And we now are coed, and that's good also. It's 
surprising to me that our young engineers today,

10:00.150 --> 10:11.667
both male and female, can get all of the 
information that they need to be good engineers.

10:12.488 --> 10:15.432
We've shortened the semester time. We've 
shortened the number of credit hours required for

10:16.053 --> 10:21.481
an engineering degree. When I graduated, we 
required 150 hours. Now it's down to 134 or

10:25.547 --> 10:32.097
something like that. And the semester is 
shortened considerably. The fall semester is

10:36.644 --> 10:44.676
over before Christmas, and there's a month off, 
which in some ways I guess it's a good time for young

10:45.263 --> 10:52.704
people to go to work and learn some money to 
continue their education or to just relax. But in

10:53.606 --> 10:57.397
our days, you didn't relax very much. You didn't 
have a full month off for Christmas. And you came

11:01.531 --> 11:09.401
back and then got to work and did your finals for the 
first semester in early February. Then you went

11:09.841 --> 11:14.927
through June, or the middle of June, for your 
spring semester. I have jokingly said all my life

11:16.629 --> 11:24.238
that one of the reasons I came to Texas A&M was 
because it was not coeducational. I didn't

11:24.259 --> 11:28.804
believe that girls and an education mixed. We did 
our socializing with the opposite sex on the

11:29.155 --> 11:33.725
weekends. We would travel, hitchhike to Waco, 
Dallas, Fort Worth, San Antonio, Austin,

11:33.806 --> 11:41.864
Houston, Galveston. We just had a lot of fun. There 
were Aggie lines, which were not violated. at the

11:47.093 --> 11:48.154
East Gate. And in most cities, there was a corner 
that was set aside for Aggie hitchhiking. And it

11:55.824 --> 11:57.186
was very effective. I actually hitchhiked to New 
Mexico one time, no problems whatsoever. When you

12:03.034 --> 12:10.624
came to A&M in 1939, about what was the size of the 
enrollment then? Do you recall? About 6,000.

12:12.606 --> 12:13.087
About 6,000. All right. Did you remain here the 
entire four years and get your degree? Yes. I got a

12:23.216 --> 12:25.200
150-hour degree. I remained the four years. 
Actually, about my sophomore year, I asked my

12:28.286 --> 12:34.539
father if I could take up flying. The war had 
started. or it just was in its early phases and I

12:39.389 --> 12:43.976
thought I'd like to fly. Some friends of mine were 
taking flying and so he said, no please don't take

12:44.036 --> 12:48.462
flying. He says that's a very dangerous, 
hazardous thing. If you won't take flying, I'll

12:51.727 --> 13:01.742
let you take a five-year course leading to 
petroleum and mechanical engineering degrees, a

12:51.727 --> 13:01.742
joint degree, and I said that's a deal. So I I 
shifted from mechanical by itself to mechanical

13:02.643 --> 13:24.668
petroleum and then the war did get started and 
Uncle Sam said, no, you must go to school all summer

13:02.643 --> 13:24.668
long and as soon as this accelerated program gets 
well defined then you will go into the service as

13:02.643 --> 13:24.668
soon as you get your degree. And so my class was the 
first class to not be able to go to a two-week summer

13:24.648 --> 13:34.307
course, or summer camp, it was called for ROTC. And 
so as a consequence of not going to this two-week

13:35.029 --> 13:42.083
summer camp, we did not get our commissions 
directly. We had to go to OCS for three months

13:42.063 --> 13:48.373
before we got our Army commission. But we all went 
at the same time. And those in the Coastal

13:52.018 --> 13:57.586
Artillery went to Camp Davis, North Carolina, 96 
of us. Those who went to Fort Sill, they went up

13:57.607 --> 13:59.970
there. And it was fish year all over again. Of 
course, Aggies have been stalwart and strong and

14:02.374 --> 14:09.184
never been licked and all that sort of thing. We 
weathered the fish year a repetition. Got our

14:12.809 --> 14:14.091
commissions. Are you a commission of second 
lieutenant? Yes. And where did you go for the three

14:17.135 --> 14:19.398
month training? Camp Davis, North Carolina. What 
part of the state of North Carolina is that in?

14:23.683 --> 14:24.905
That's in the eastern part. Along the coast? It's 
about, it was about ten miles I believe from the

14:26.868 --> 14:32.455
intercoastal canal. How long were, when you were 
commissioned as a second lieutenant, where did

14:33.346 --> 14:39.577
you report the duty afterwards? I reported the 
duty to Camp Davis as an instructor in the

14:39.797 --> 14:47.770
communications part of the school. How long did 
you remain there? I remained there for about eight

14:50.335 --> 14:54.662
months. And then... That was 1943. 1943. And then I 
asked to get into radar. And I transferred to a

15:05.054 --> 15:12.542
radar course and would then begin to teach radar. I 
came back to Texas and married Joyce Kirkland,

15:13.343 --> 15:25.936
also from San Antonio, in 1944, and was assigned 
back to Camp Davis in the school. Gordon, can I get

15:27.297 --> 15:29.259
with you a little bit later? Yeah, if you want to see 
me. Yeah, I'll give you a call.

15:34.737 --> 15:54.265
To a radar officer's position in an artillery 
group, my job was to inspect the train, to inspect

15:34.737 --> 15:54.265
the proficiency, to inspect the equipment, its 
operations, its combat readiness, and that sort

15:34.737 --> 15:54.265
of thing. We stayed at Camp Davis until, I believe, 
the end of September 1944, and then were

15:54.245 --> 16:20.276
transferred to Fort Bliss, Texas, where I was a 
radar officer in a school battalion responsible

15:54.245 --> 16:20.276
for conducting firing for other students going 
through the artillery course at Fort Bliss. When

16:20.296 --> 16:21.417
were you discharged? I was not discharged. I was 
given a direct regular Army commission as an honor

16:26.174 --> 16:44.191
graduate of Texas A&M University in December of 
1944, with a retroactive date back to 6 May of 43. So

16:45.472 --> 16:52.078
having a regular Army commission, which was quite 
a prestigious type of of an honor, I decided I would

16:53.037 --> 16:56.761
give it a try. And I decided also to get into guided 
missiles. So I attended the first guided missile

17:01.786 --> 17:07.092
course that the Army offered at Fort Bliss, Texas. 
And while there, the Army opened up a civilian

17:07.512 --> 17:19.585
schooling program, which is still going on, to 
train selected engineers, physicists, and other

17:20.392 --> 17:36.396
disciplines to advance degrees, the military 
having the view that they have need for highly

17:20.392 --> 17:36.396
skilled and trained professionals also. I was in 
guided missiles. California Institute of

17:41.163 --> 17:48.053
Technology, Caltech, offered a course in guided 
missiles leading to a master's degree. And it was a

17:48.455 --> 17:54.521
two-year course, and I applied for Caltech and 
MIT. And I got to Caltech, went there early July of

17:55.882 --> 18:07.272
1946 now after I came back to this guided missile 
course from overseas. And took the guided missile

18:07.292 --> 18:14.939
course at Fort Bliss, Texas in January through the 
first part of May of 46. Then went to Caltech. for

18:17.902 --> 18:20.784
two years to get a master's degree. I got my 
master's degree in one year and decided to use the

18:20.805 --> 18:33.335
time to get a professional degree, a professional 
engineering degree, which was an intermediate

18:20.805 --> 18:33.335
degree between the master's and the PhD. I applied 
for an additional year to get my PhD and they gave me

18:34.236 --> 18:43.945
two years, which turned out to be needed to get the 
Doctor of Philosophy. I got my Doctor of

18:44.745 --> 18:47.908
Philosophy in 1950 in mechanical and electrical 
engineering from the California Institute of

18:48.985 --> 18:53.308
Technology. and was assigned to the Army's 
Research and Development Program in guided

18:54.267 --> 19:00.454
missiles. And I had nothing but the finest of 
assignments. I had four years in the Office Chief

19:04.299 --> 19:12.188
of Research and Development in the Pentagon, 
Washington, D.C. I briefed the President's

19:12.208 --> 19:17.635
Science Advisor, House Appropriations 
Committee. Who was the science advisor that you

19:17.895 --> 19:19.897
were talking about? George Kiskakowski. Well, 
you were still in the military while you were

19:22.921 --> 19:27.688
working on your Ph.D. at Caltech. Yes, that's 
correct. I see. There was an obligation of four

19:29.891 --> 19:36.981
years for that four years that I took to get my 
degree. And after the four years, I was offered a

19:38.202 --> 19:46.414
position in California with TRW,

19:38.202 --> 19:46.414
which was the leading company in our nation's 
space program. I decided to stay with the Army, and

19:51.092 --> 19:55.425
I felt like the Army needed qualified people in 
their research and development program. So I

19:59.789 --> 20:01.871
decided to stay in the military. I stayed for 20 
years and then was under 50 years old and decided

20:01.891 --> 20:09.900
that if I was going to start a second career, I'd 
better get out. So I got out in 1970 and came back

20:10.160 --> 20:19.371
home to Texas A&M University. And it's been coming 
home to Texas A&M University for the last 11 years.

20:25.739 --> 20:32.007
It's been a very gratifying and a very rewarding 
job. I feel like I've helped A&M in its growth

20:32.128 --> 20:38.296
period here, particularly in its research side of 
the house. I think my experience in research and

20:38.416 --> 20:47.147
development over the previous 20 years was 
extremely valuable to this job. And I think we've

20:47.667 --> 20:52.459
made some real progress. Research at a university 
assists not just the income to the university, but

20:52.559 --> 20:58.774
also it maintains the competency, the relevancy, 
the currency of its professional academic staff.

21:08.513 --> 21:17.583
It keeps the students advised of the latest 
technology, of the current problems of the

21:08.513 --> 21:17.583
country, the technical problem. It gets them 
involved in helping solve current technical

21:18.084 --> 21:21.408
problems. It helps pay stipends to graduate 
students. It helps professional staff to attend

21:27.715 --> 21:41.491
technical meetings, make presentations, do 
their research, develop competency, a track

21:27.715 --> 21:41.491
record, and help solve our country's problems. So 
I've been very gratified. All right. You were in

21:43.553 --> 21:46.797
California for four years and then you moved to 
Washington. No, I went to Fort Knox, Kentucky for

21:47.217 --> 21:53.044
three years and I was in there It was called Army 
Field Forces Testing Board there. I helped test

21:58.830 --> 22:03.116
ammunition, missiles. I had done my mechanical 
engineering thesis, it was called at that time,

22:04.738 --> 22:13.430
they're now called dissertation, in metallurgy. 
And so, hence, I helped evaluate there. the armor,

22:19.298 --> 22:33.409
the tanks, the ammunition, and also I got involved 
in teaching, not in teaching, in testing

22:19.298 --> 22:33.409
what was classified at that time as night viewing 
equipment. I conducted a leaflet two test

22:33.963 --> 22:43.136
consisting of a battalion of tanks, a company of 
artillery, a lot of signal communications

22:33.963 --> 22:43.136
equipment. We went to Camp Davis, North Carolina, 
and conducted a three-month test all at night.

22:49.846 --> 22:51.869
This equipment would allow you to see at night. It 
would allow you to conduct artillery barrages at

22:51.889 --> 22:55.735
night. drive tanks at night and drive all over the 
place. It was rather an exciting assignment.

23:01.900 --> 23:14.072
After that, I went to the artillery advance course 
and then to the guided missile school at Fort

23:01.900 --> 23:14.072
Bliss, Texas, where I was a research instructor 
teaching research, new technology, and so on.

23:14.092 --> 23:17.615
From there to the command and general staff school 
at Fort Leavenworth. Could you give dates as we go

23:17.635 --> 23:19.557
along on this? Sure. So keep it straight, the dates 
that you were at Fort Bliss the second time. I left

23:24.301 --> 23:27.645
Fort Bliss the second time in 19... 57

23:28.672 --> 23:34.158
and went to Fort Leavenworth, Kansas. Graduated 
from the Command and General Staff School in 1957

23:34.919 --> 23:42.086
in May or June, May I presume. Went to Korea and in 
Korea I had my initial assignment in the

23:42.747 --> 23:56.502
Philippines for three months as a coordinating 
officer regarding the strategic weapons

23:56.482 --> 23:57.243
planning. The Formosan Straits were very hot at 
that time. Then went back to Korea in December of 58

24:01.408 --> 24:22.472
and stayed as the G3 training officer of 1st Corps 
in Korea and came back to Washington DC in October

24:23.212 --> 24:31.760
of 1959 and was in the Missiles and Space Division 
of the Office of Chief Research and Development

24:23.212 --> 24:31.760
for four years. Responsible for the final testing 
phases of the Redstone, of the Jupiter missiles. I

24:42.770 --> 24:52.999
was responsible for the Pershing Army missile 
developed by Martin Marietta for the Army Missile

24:42.770 --> 24:52.999
Command. I had some involvement with the Sergeant 
Missile, but primarily I was responsible for the

24:53.823 --> 25:12.565
Pershing Missile, which was tested at Cape 
Canaveral, one of the most successful firing

24:53.823 --> 25:12.565
programs, launching programs of the Army's 
missile program. It was a solid propellant

25:12.686 --> 25:16.070
missile. From that assignment, When I was given a 
political type assignment, the chief of research

25:19.540 --> 25:28.673
and development, being pleased with my four 
years, gave me a tour in Hawaii. where I was a G3

25:29.260 --> 25:34.147
missile officer at Fort Shafter. I thought we were 
going to be there for three years, and I was on my

25:34.888 --> 25:57.360
initial orientation tour to the artillery units 
in Korea, to the weapons areas in Japan, Okinawa,

25:34.888 --> 25:57.360
Formosa, Taiwan, Philippines, and to Guam. And 
while I was in Guam on the return The leg of my trip, I

26:06.217 --> 26:14.245
was asked if I'd like to talk to my wife over the 
signal, single sideband telecommunications

26:06.217 --> 26:14.245
system. I said, yes. And so I called, and I talked to 
my wife. And she was in Honolulu. And she said,

26:19.831 --> 26:21.692
congratulations. I said, congratulations what? 
She said, you're going back to Washington. This

26:25.296 --> 26:27.518
was about a month after we'd gotten there. I said, 
what for? She said, you've been selected to go to

26:28.299 --> 26:32.443
the Industrial College of the Armed Forces. Where 
is this? It's at Fort Myer in Washington, D.C. And

26:34.105 --> 26:40.954
it's a prestigious school. It's an excellent 
school. And from there, we had all of the heads of

26:43.557 --> 26:56.834
all of the executive branches or parts of the 
executive branch, congressmen, the president

26:43.557 --> 26:56.834
talked to his vice president. We learned... the 
upper levels in how government is run, and how

27:00.487 --> 27:10.638
political tradeoffs are required, and how 
democracy works, and it works. It works very well.

27:13.962 --> 27:30.460
From Fort Myer, then I went to the Army Missile 
Command in Huntsville, Alabama, where I was the

27:13.962 --> 27:30.460
project manager for the Shillelagh missile 
system. which is a cannon-fired missile that is

27:31.216 --> 27:38.386
optically tracked. The target is optically 
tracked, and the missile is guided by infrared

27:38.447 --> 27:49.022
signals to the receivers in the base of the 
missile. It, again, was a very successful and

27:49.002 --> 27:54.069
highly reliable system. We had about a 
ninety-five percent hit probability, and that

27:54.089 --> 28:02.821
includes missile reliability operator errors 
and the whole thing. I guess I was one of the first, I

28:03.522 --> 28:10.892
guess I was the first project manager to ever 
personally fire his his missile. I did this at

28:12.753 --> 28:21.709
White Sand Missile Range, tracking a target at 
2,000 yards, going 20 miles an hour, and I missed

28:12.753 --> 28:21.709
the bullseye 18 inches. This is not classified. 
This is just a, that was release type information.

28:29.122 --> 28:33.630
So we were very pleased with that. I left after 
three years at Huntsville, Alabama, the Army

28:36.877 --> 28:50.582
Missile Command, after producing a very 
successful missile, and was the commanding

28:36.877 --> 28:50.582
officer of the 94th Artillery Group in West 
Germany. This was a group of six battalions of Nike

28:51.406 --> 28:55.450
Hercules missiles. That's 24 firing batteries, 
and the Hercules missile is war-headed with

28:56.491 --> 29:07.281
special weapons, and it's a very responsible type 
of a job. I was very pleased with the job,

29:07.302 --> 29:14.689
which I held for two years. As I said earlier, I 
decided in 1970 that I was under 50 years old. If I

29:23.613 --> 29:25.957
was going to have a second career, I'd better get 
out. And I got out without a job and interviewed at

29:26.818 --> 29:39.218
the State Department because of my missile 
experience and my Caltech schooling. They

29:39.739 --> 29:41.562
offered me a job in the SALT. group to discuss 
strategic arm limitations, having had the right

29:42.048 --> 29:50.760
kind of backgrounds. I thought that might be a good 
job, but they

29:50.780 --> 29:59.653
couldn't sell me on Washington, D.C. It's just too 
much of a hassle. I interviewed at the Missile

30:03.078 --> 30:07.183
Command in Huntsville. I interviewed at the 
University of Alabama. At Huntsville, I was

30:10.482 --> 30:13.226
offered a job there. I interviewed at Texas A&M, I 
was offered a job here. I interviewed in Austin at

30:16.931 --> 30:25.403
the Water Quality Board at that time, and I was 
offered a job there. And I decided to, there were

30:25.443 --> 30:32.473
indications I could have gotten an offer of a job. 
at the University of Texas at El Paso, but I decided

30:32.453 --> 30:42.126
to come here to go work with Harry Whitmore and 
build the engineering research program at Texas

30:32.453 --> 30:42.126
A&M.

30:45.920 --> 30:50.567
During all this time, you and your family, you must 
have moved more than 20 or 30 times. About 25 times.

30:51.949 --> 30:52.249
25. I know that during the last campaign, Vice 
President Bush said that they had moved 28 times in

30:53.131 --> 30:58.578
30 years. I thought that was quite a bit. You almost 
matched his record. You must have seemed like you

31:01.363 --> 31:04.307
had the moving van ready at all times. No, not at 
all. Not at all. And I find that classmates in

31:06.330 --> 31:14.762
industry have had to move also if they're going to 
have Take advantage of promotions. You have to

31:17.406 --> 31:18.147
move. You have to change. You have to be ready to do 
new things. If you stay in the same job too long, you

31:25.256 --> 31:30.243
can get stale. But I don't think I've ever gotten 
stale in any job, including this one that I've had

31:30.263 --> 31:36.531
for 11 years, as I say. Just to me, this job here at 
A&M has been the most dynamic, most challenging,

31:36.511 --> 31:45.865
most rewarding job of any. I've seen the research 
program here at A&M in engineering go from, oh, $4

31:47.287 --> 31:58.603
million to, like, $15 million.

32:01.199 --> 32:05.283
Then these moves weren't that hard on your 
families. We felt, and I think the kids feel, we

32:05.543 --> 32:12.269
have four children, one daughter and three sons. 
The kids felt that it was highly rewarding to them,

32:12.289 --> 32:15.892
too.

32:20.136 --> 32:23.600
They are all very dynamic individuals. They 
accept challenges. They feel like they had the

32:26.342 --> 32:30.666
best of all worlds. They were able to travel 
internationally, and they have friends all over

32:31.237 --> 32:37.864
the country now. It was not a disadvantageous 
thing for the family.

32:44.831 --> 32:45.031
All right. Since you've been here, you've been 
concerned with research and development. Have

32:48.154 --> 32:49.315
you done any teaching? I have not done any 
teaching. On occasion, I will give a lecture on

32:51.397 --> 32:59.185
research, sponsorship, how it's conducted with 
the federal government. What are the advantages

33:03.502 --> 33:08.391
of doing research in an educational institution? 
This last month, the annual conference of the

33:09.733 --> 33:17.207
American Society for Engineering Education, I 
constructed a session and moderated the session

33:17.947 --> 33:27.482
on university research programs of selected 
federal agencies. I had the assistant director of

33:27.682 --> 33:38.419
the National Science Foundation there from 
Washington, Dr. Jack Sanderson. the Deputy

33:38.770 --> 33:44.076
Technical Director of the Office of Naval 
Research there, also from Washington. Dr. Bob

33:45.057 --> 33:49.262
Lundegaard, he is the Deputy Technical Director 
of all of ONR. Could you spell his name, please?

33:51.524 --> 33:55.849
Lundegaard, L-U-N-D-E-G-A-R-D, Lundegaard. 
And then I had Dr. Richard Stevens from the

33:55.869 --> 34:01.636
Department of Energy come. Is that V or P-H and 
Stevens? P-H. P-H and Stevens. He gave us the

34:04.437 --> 34:10.393
current status of university research programs 
in the Department of Energy. And so we had a very

34:10.534 --> 34:14.204
fine coverage. We had a very large attendance of 
both new educators from all over the country who

34:21.008 --> 34:27.900
come to the ASWE program to learn how to do 
research, what agencies are doing what. I was very

34:27.920 --> 34:34.651
pleased to see that the new educators felt that it 
was a fine session. They came down and told me so at

34:34.671 --> 34:37.836
the end of it. I was also somewhat amused that a lot 
of the older The research administrators felt

34:44.347 --> 34:47.930
like it was a good session, too. They take 
advantage of those sorts of things, too. I have a

34:52.895 --> 34:57.158
book here called 100 Years of Engineering at Texas 
A&M. It was published in 1976 by C.W. Crawford and

35:01.282 --> 35:03.524
others who contributed. And this book says that 
the experiment station was established in 1914 to

35:04.065 --> 35:10.711
aid the industrial development of Texas. 
Primarily, it started out as... Dealing with road

35:14.401 --> 35:20.288
building, as you know, Texas has one of the best 
road systems in the country. Also with water and

35:20.308 --> 35:22.551
sanitation. What are, again, could you summarize 
some of the main points that the research and

35:22.571 --> 35:29.420
development staff is involved in today? Some of 
the specific items. Well, first of all, the first

35:32.684 --> 35:44.138
written word that I found on the history of this 
organization was in the catalog for 1914.

35:44.995 --> 36:13.416
Dean Spence was the director at that time, and the 
written word at that time said that this

35:44.995 --> 36:13.416
engineering experiment station was established 
to parallel the agricultural experiment

35:44.995 --> 36:13.416
station, the agricultural experiment station 
having as a purpose to help solve problems of rural

35:44.995 --> 36:13.416
life, The Engineering Experiment Station had its 
purpose to assist in solving the technical

36:13.801 --> 36:26.935
questions of urban life and questions of a special 
importance to Texas industries. And the third

36:27.696 --> 36:35.104
part of its responsibility was to publish results 
of their research. So it was not just to aid in the

36:36.185 --> 36:40.129
industrial development of the state, but also to 
help cities solve their technical problems, and

36:40.615 --> 36:48.045
that we're doing today also. Today's 
organization again includes researchers from

36:48.065 --> 36:55.775
all engineering departments. It also has added a 
division with Prairie View A&M to help bring that

36:57.097 --> 37:08.952
school into the mainstream of engineering 
research and to assist them in developing their

36:57.097 --> 37:08.952
program. We have a joint program now with the 
College of Business Administration. That is a

37:15.344 --> 37:19.270
business engineering division. I have an 
education and engineering division now with the

37:19.290 --> 37:24.718
College of Education. We have a remote sensing 
center, which was established about 1968 as a

37:25.759 --> 37:37.858
consortium of colleges of engineering, science, 
geoscience, and agriculture. We have the Nuclear

37:38.497 --> 37:50.553
Science Center, which has assisted over 60, 65 
medical colleges and research laboratories and

37:38.497 --> 37:50.553
universities throughout the region. We have also 
Industrial Economics Research Division, and we

37:52.615 --> 38:07.795
have a Strategic Technology Division that does 
defense-related work. Incidentally, I might say

38:08.753 --> 38:19.970
that some of A&M's attributes are, I think,

38:08.753 --> 38:19.970
derived from its early military origin. This 
university was not anti-defense

38:21.152 --> 38:27.561
work. There was none of the rioting on the campus 
during the anti-Vietnam days. We are not adverse

38:35.298 --> 38:44.226
to doing defense-related research, and we do do 
defense-related research. We have research

38:44.246 --> 39:00.861
programs, either basic or applied, with the Army 
Research Office, the U.S. Air Force Office of

38:44.246 --> 39:00.861
Scientific Research, the Office of Naval 
Research, Department of Defense agencies

38:44.246 --> 39:00.861
throughout. So I think our early heritage has paid 
off in our research programs also. How does the A&M

39:08.189 --> 39:14.435
research program rank compared to other 
institutions in the nation? I haven't seen the

39:14.455 --> 39:22.282
latest but the latest that I did see we were ranked 
about 18th in the country. This was a ranking by the

39:22.802 --> 39:28.328
National Science Foundation and that's pretty 
good standing. Industrial support wise we do

39:29.349 --> 39:32.912
perhaps more

39:33.483 --> 39:40.670
industrially sponsored research than most 
universities. I think our ranking there was

39:40.730 --> 39:50.881
number four in the country and that's a relative 
sort of thing.

39:50.901 --> 39:57.488
Would the dispute over the permanent university 
fund affect research programs? The university

39:59.029 --> 40:00.891
fund provides funds for building facilities, 
buildings, and helps a university grow in that way

40:02.052 --> 40:11.341
primarily. And although the Engineering 
Experiment Station has been most successful in

40:12.662 --> 40:31.519
their engineering research program and have 
generated funds as a result of this contract

40:12.662 --> 40:31.519
research involvement and has been able to help pay 
for buildings and research equipment. The

40:35.515 --> 40:53.052
university fund provides even greater resources 
for the total university and hence helps the total

40:35.515 --> 40:53.052
university program, the university system 
program I think you perhaps need to say these days.

40:53.092 --> 40:58.857
I'm from the old school so I think of Texas A&M as 
Texas A&M in all of its parts. But today, there's

40:59.562 --> 41:05.130
more emphasis on the separate parts of the 
university system. And the university itself is

41:05.230 --> 41:16.307
now a separate part and co-equal with the Ag 
Engineering Environment Station and Extension

41:05.230 --> 41:16.307
Services and that sort of thing. I hope that this 
separation is not detrimental to the overall

41:17.028 --> 41:24.839
Texas A&M. Because we need to maintain the 
attitude We are Texas A&M, and we can help solve the

41:28.402 --> 41:34.250
nation's problems. Let me ask you, Dr. Bain, about 
the $15 million in research funds that you have for

41:34.951 --> 41:41.019
this present year. About what is the breakdown of 
where this money has come from? Now, $15 million is

41:45.725 --> 41:49.049
not the total research program. The total 
research program is more like $25 million. The $15

41:52.814 --> 41:57.801
million is total sponsored research. In other 
words, that is research paid for by our customers,

41:58.507 --> 42:16.560
paid for by the sponsors who endorse and consider 
their problems of significant importance to the

41:58.507 --> 42:16.560
point of such significance that they're willing 
to pay for the research. Could you tell us who some

42:17.041 --> 42:20.287
of these are? Oh, yes. NASA, this university does 
or this engineering experiment station does

42:22.435 --> 42:33.469
quite a bit of work for National Aeronautics and 
Space Administration. We did quite a bit of work on

42:33.509 --> 42:38.315
the space shuttle and its wind tunnel testing. We 
do quite a bit on lignite research sponsored by the

42:39.116 --> 42:46.806
Department of Energy and also by Texas 
Industries. Petroleum companies are all

42:47.360 --> 43:01.094
acquiring coal and lignite resources, and we've 
been involved in ways to harness that energy from

42:47.360 --> 43:01.094
Texas resources. Many, many industries, Exxon, 
Texaco, Phillips, Sun, Arco, Conoco, you name it,

43:03.316 --> 43:12.886
this university's involved. What about state and 
federal funding? State funding the engineering

43:15.490 --> 43:25.302
experiment station for this next biennium will be 
about five million. Now for that five million, we

43:25.322 --> 43:32.891
create capabilities at Texas A&M to do creditable 
research. We hire new faculty and new researchers

43:33.692 --> 43:37.617
and give them an opportunity to do research and 
develop some credibility to demonstrate their

43:38.069 --> 43:50.645
capabilities and then help solve the real world's 
problems. And we would expect that the $5 million

43:50.746 --> 43:56.193
would generate $20 million in sponsored 
research. What about the other $5 million? The

43:58.135 --> 44:05.545
other $5 million, we operate the data processing 
center, we operate a research and instrument

43:58.135 --> 44:05.545
shop, the Nuclear Science Center, and all of these 
have budgets. The other five million is in income

44:12.514 --> 44:25.653
to those organizations and for the operation of 
those facilities for the benefit of the entire

44:12.514 --> 44:25.653
university system. Have you found that the state 
legislature has been lenient or generous in

44:28.593 --> 44:31.137
funding the research program? The state 
legislature has been very fair in their

44:31.157 --> 44:43.415
assessment of the benefits of engineering 
research at Texas A&M to the state and its economic

44:31.157 --> 44:43.415
development. They've been very fair in their 
judgment. They've not always given us what we ask

44:45.518 --> 44:47.520
for. They always cut back to some extent and expect 
us to do better in our acquiring additional

44:47.540 --> 44:57.790
sponsored research. And so far, with the very fine 
economic atmosphere in Texas and in the country,

44:58.371 --> 45:05.958
we've been able to do that. And we've been able to 
continue a phenomenal growth. One of our years

45:10.523 --> 45:12.505
that I recall, Our statistics, we had a growth of 
35% in sponsored research. What year was that?

45:21.123 --> 45:25.515
That was about 1975.

45:27.132 --> 45:34.342
We've had 17%, 25%, 35% growth, those kinds of 
figures in one year. And that's phenomenal. It's

45:37.025 --> 45:44.796
almost the same kinds of growth that the 
enrollment at Texas A&M has experienced. With an

45:44.816 --> 45:48.160
increase in enrollment, you have an increase in 
faculty requirements. And when you increase

45:48.781 --> 45:51.925
faculty requirements, you also have I need to pay 
those faculty, and we pay part of their salary for

45:52.175 --> 45:58.147
their research involvement. And that allows 
departments to hire two people in place of one. It

46:02.617 --> 46:05.282
helps develop the total program. Can we pause 
here, please? Sure.
