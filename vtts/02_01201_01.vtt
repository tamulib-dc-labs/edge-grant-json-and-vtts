WEBVTT

00:02.258 --> 00:05.802
Okay, now we got it. It's, what, Tuesday, April 
15th. Tax day. Tax day. 1997, and we're at the home

00:14.313 --> 00:24.426
of Joe and Betty Moore in Austin, Texas, and we're 
going to talk about the Texas A&M University Press

00:14.313 --> 00:24.426
and about the Moores. And I don't know who wants to 
begin, but... No, you were starting out. Tell me

00:29.779 --> 00:33.324
about how you came along, literally, originally. 
How I got to A&M. You were born in Alvin. Let's start

00:36.849 --> 00:37.530
there. That's correct. And my dad was a dairy 
farmer. He actually had four dairies. So I was

00:45.942 --> 00:51.389
raised on a farm until I went to A&M. Okay, now when 
were you born, if you don't mind? 1917. 1917. March

00:54.633 --> 00:55.755
29th. And in our family,

00:57.490 --> 01:06.844
we had four boys

00:57.490 --> 01:06.844
and three girls. Seven. Our older

01:09.809 --> 01:17.541
brother went to the M. Actually, he went to the 
junior college first, and he went to the M. Did you

01:17.740 --> 01:19.443
go to school in Alvin? Oh yes, I graduated in Alvin 
High School. I think there were only twenty-four

01:23.388 --> 01:31.600
graduating seniors when I graduated in 1934.

01:31.620 --> 01:39.372
But anyhow, I guess the first I heard of A&M was my 
brother.

01:39.392 --> 01:42.597
I suppose he liked it. Then he decided my mother 
said that she was going to have all of her children

01:45.820 --> 01:57.575
go to college.

01:57.595 --> 01:59.317
So, Warren picked me up there one time. I was 
divided between studying agriculture or

01:59.337 --> 02:04.985
engineering. I got interested in engineering 
because the oil exploration was active. about

02:12.668 --> 02:17.435
that time in the area where we lived. Actually, we 
brought in a field several miles from where we

02:17.455 --> 02:24.145
lived. There was a lot of geophysical activity 
going on. That's where I got interested in oil

02:30.073 --> 02:32.617
business. I didn't know whether to stay in 
agriculture, which I knew from the ground up

02:34.039 --> 02:38.926
already. Too well. My dad encouraged me to studied 
engineering. Actually, I started from geology.

02:48.094 --> 02:54.782
And they had what they called a course in 
geological engineering at that time, and that's

02:48.094 --> 02:54.782
what I enrolled in. Okay, so what year was that? I 
started in 1934. 1934. Yeah. And was Buck Shewitz

03:01.931 --> 03:04.334
in that class? No, he was much younger than me. 
Okay. I'd say I was in class of 1938. All right. I'd

03:12.710 --> 03:14.052
say he was about forty. Forty-one.

03:18.460 --> 03:20.724
Okay. And who, when you were enrolled, I just 
finished doing a little history of chemical

03:20.744 --> 03:33.486
engineering at A&M, and Duke Fortin was one of the 
big chemical engineer, I guess he's kind of, what

03:34.175 --> 03:39.201
all are you doing? Did you remember him at all? Was 
he at EMF? Yes, sir. As a professor. The only one I

03:43.906 --> 03:45.148
remember is Brake. Okay, yeah. Professor Brake. 
D-R-A-Y-T-O-R-E. Yeah. Let's see, who was the

03:50.294 --> 03:53.558
head of EMF? I was advised by people in agriculture 
that I've never passed chemistry or calculus.

04:02.812 --> 04:06.075
Yeah, I did. I changed from geological 
engineering to petroleum engineering because I

04:06.095 --> 04:16.806
was advised at that time it was easier to get a job. 
But anyhow, I graduated petroleum engineering

04:16.826 --> 04:28.178
and then I decided that I needed more geology, more 
petroleum geology. The professor at A&M at that

04:29.002 --> 04:41.234
time was what you call a hard

04:29.002 --> 04:41.234
rock geologist. And he didn't know much about the, 
that was Dr. Baker, but anyhow. Then I went to

04:46.440 --> 04:52.766
Oklahoma University and took all of their geology 
courses.

04:56.670 --> 04:58.452
And I got a massive degree from there and I was lucky 
enough to have offered us three jobs when I got out,

05:01.267 --> 05:09.317
probably because I had experience in the oil 
field. Had you worked in the oil fields in the

05:09.337 --> 05:11.340
summer? Yes. I worked three summers on the 
drilling board.

05:23.455 --> 05:27.781
One of my students. During the, after I graduated, 
And I was waiting to go to Oklahoma.

05:36.038 --> 05:36.718
And I met Betty. Betty was visiting her 
grandmother and uncle in Alvin. She had been born

05:44.085 --> 05:52.734
in Alvin, but had moved to Ohio. And she was 
visiting back when I met her. I worked with her that

05:57.190 --> 06:05.122
summer when I was working in the rig and decided to 
get married. So we married at Christmas time,

06:05.162 --> 06:19.384
actually December 23rd, when I was at Oklahoma 
University.

06:24.663 --> 06:42.706
She was

06:24.663 --> 06:42.706
a big help

06:24.663 --> 06:42.706
with me all the time.

06:45.589 --> 06:50.776
We were, I'd say, moving from job to

06:45.589 --> 06:50.776
job. I first went with Cheryl, and we moved about 
ten times the first year. It was actually a

06:52.218 --> 06:52.958
two-year transport. And we moved, we lived in 
Louisiana. We first went to And then they moved

06:55.578 --> 07:09.148
me to Louisiana, worked on different things. But 
the fact that I had worked in the oil field, I had

07:10.175 --> 07:18.666
quite an advantage over the other guys that had 
never been in the oil field. And then having Betty

07:18.686 --> 07:23.492
along, it's more... Anyhow, we were actually 
pretty privileged and moved up pretty fast. In

07:29.780 --> 07:30.521
Shell. How long were you with Shell? About four 
years. Four years. And I had an offer with a smaller

07:35.507 --> 07:39.692
company I had made up my mind that Shell had what 
they called exploitation engineering, not

07:40.027 --> 07:50.978
geology. I wanted to get into geology, and I was 
offered a job in . Anyhow, I took the job. about

08:05.356 --> 08:13.444
twice the scale

08:05.356 --> 08:13.444
of Shell. And I worked with them for about four 
years. And then there was a consultant, I'd say, an

08:21.573 --> 08:31.363
independent geologist that had found the field 
and was working with Fuller for a long time. a

08:31.748 --> 08:41.700
fellow named Sam

08:31.748 --> 08:41.700
Marshall. He was probably one of the best site 
geologists. He got no publicity because he didn't

08:45.585 --> 08:54.276
publish anything or anything

08:45.585 --> 08:54.276
else. He just found quite a lot of oil. His dad, he 
was a graduate of the University of... No, no, no.

08:57.200 --> 08:57.901
His dad, he may be right. He could have been a 
graduate. professor,

08:59.407 --> 09:17.267
head of geology department at Madison, 
Wisconsin.

09:17.287 --> 09:18.428
Anyhow, that was the background. He knew more 
basic limestone geology, and that's what West

09:18.448 --> 09:22.853
Texas is. And I went independent working under 
him. So I've been in independent geology since. So

09:25.377 --> 09:29.802
what year, what year did you go independent, just 
out of curiosity? I'd say, let's see,

09:29.822 --> 09:40.634
I started working

09:29.822 --> 09:40.634
in the 40s or 50s. In the 50s or 50s. In Hobbs, New 
Mexico. Right. And we lived in Hobbs, New Mexico

09:43.337 --> 09:46.580
for about a year. Oh, did you? Okay. Because that 
was the development

09:47.581 --> 09:52.386
of the deeper zones in the Western Basin. Right. 
And because of our interest in production,

09:55.263 --> 10:04.552
re-production, gathered sands right down on the 
coast. We got interested in the Williston Basin.

10:07.354 --> 10:09.656
You know where the Williston Basin is in North 
Dakota? Roughly, yeah. So we would work during the

10:10.517 --> 10:22.148
winter months in West Texas and then the summer 
months in North Dakota. You were migrants early

10:22.415 --> 10:25.880
on. Well, actually, it's foresightedness that 
Sam Marshall had. Actually, we were drawn to the

10:30.226 --> 10:39.840
area, the Wilson Basin, when a well blew out in 
Alberta County. It was a big field that was a

10:39.860 --> 10:49.333
barnstorming reef, and we were trying to trace 
that reef down into the Wilson Basin. We found out

10:49.651 --> 11:00.960
it was completely different geology, but we got 
interested and did work in the Western Basin

10:49.651 --> 11:00.960
before they found the field. that we already

11:02.105 --> 11:24.805
had the geology and had made some ideas about where 
we had the best prospects. We still, right now, my

11:25.190 --> 11:30.818
son is running our company. He's got a little bit of 
a family on him. Our office is in Midland. In

11:33.923 --> 11:34.364
Midland. We moved. We advanced up from Oz to 
Midland. To Midland, okay. We're probably with

11:39.632 --> 11:43.317
Midland in the 60s. And

11:43.297 --> 11:51.566
I've been retired all this time continually 
working. Yeah, that's what happens. My son Ron is

11:54.209 --> 11:57.792
our company now. Our operation right now mostly is 
in the district. Do you still keep up with him? Not

12:01.917 --> 12:03.919
too much. Well, he's getting faxed well reports 
every morning. Yeah, we're still at it. We had

12:09.014 --> 12:12.560
something going on in Louisiana. But my son does, I 
mean he runs everything, the details. And the only

12:18.611 --> 12:23.119
thing I do is try to help him with the archaeology. 
That's interesting. I know what you're talking

12:25.223 --> 12:27.807
about a little bit. I worked with a seismograph 
team one summer You really know something, man. I

12:33.866 --> 12:59.068
did a fun book on, I don't know if you ever saw it, but 
I did a fun book on, I don't know if you ever saw it,

12:33.866 --> 12:59.068
but I did a fun book on, I don't know if you ever saw 
it, but I did a fun book on, I don't know if you ever

12:33.866 --> 12:59.068
saw it, but I did a I know another thing about the oil 
business. When they were having the big oil boom at

13:02.137 --> 13:08.363
College Station, I invested. And I never saw 
$3,500 go down quite so fast in all my life. That's

13:15.890 --> 13:20.415
the worst anything anybody can do is invest, but 
not in the oil business. Oh, I tell you, it was

13:20.435 --> 13:23.578
interesting, educational. Let Manny tell you a 
little bit about that. Please, yeah. early deals,

13:26.217 --> 13:32.084
because that kind of gets us up to where we started. 
Actually, we were living in Midland. No, I'm

13:35.648 --> 13:37.109
sorry. We had moved to Midland and had a house out 
here at Lakeland.

13:48.041 --> 13:55.870
And that's the time that we got involved with Frank 
Wardle, even though we had been involved with the

13:56.896 --> 14:02.024
Farmer Students Association and knew Jack 
Williams before that time. Okay, well, we'll come

14:02.044 --> 14:03.386
back there. Betty, you're from Alvin, too? I'm 
from Alvin,

14:07.773 --> 14:14.483
but I moved to Ohio when I was 12 and stayed there. 
Did you really? Well, it's just like you said,

14:18.003 --> 14:27.275
people that have never been on an airplane and they 
don't know what they've been taught in their

14:18.003 --> 14:27.275
backyard or something. Where'd you move to in 
Ohio? It was Deshner, Ohio. Northwest Ohio.

14:35.033 --> 14:38.098
Anyway, as soon as I could, I got back to Texas. But 
anyway, I met Joe and Alvin. I didn't know him. I

14:41.442 --> 14:43.245
thought he was going to A&M. I met him later through 
a mutual girlfriend. He didn't know that he was

14:46.850 --> 14:50.396
married. That happens. She's on the good side of 
it. Well, we married in 1939, and we had three sons.

15:04.649 --> 15:11.345
When we first got married, we moved about four or 
five years ago. We moved 10 times in the first two

15:11.365 --> 15:15.474
years. It was a little bit of a shell. It was a 
training program, you know, so we'd be one office.

15:19.404 --> 15:21.308
We started out in Houston. That should have been a 
good background, too. Did you have a good sense of

15:25.666 --> 15:31.571
the whole thing? I knew what they were

15:31.591 --> 15:37.096
doing. I worked in a gasoline bank. I worked at a 
rig. And then I worked in an office. I worked under a

15:40.700 --> 15:42.021
law department. I had a cousin who retired from, 
Bob Jordan. He was living in Thailand. What area

15:47.045 --> 15:51.109
was he in? So then you got together, you married, 
you moved a lot, and how was the oil business for

15:51.275 --> 15:56.104
you? Well, we liked every place we lived. We lived 
in some dumps. Top salary for a guy with a master's

16:01.694 --> 16:08.547
degree in geology at that time was $135 a month.

16:11.192 --> 16:12.574
With three owners I had. Two of them were 125, and 
one of them was 135. Because I took shells in the

16:20.016 --> 16:25.001
training camp. I remember another thing about the 
oil business. When I finished Texas in 1956, I had a

16:31.587 --> 16:36.892
lot of friends in geology. They didn't get any 
jobs. They were a shock. And so When did you begin to

16:42.254 --> 16:49.524
feel like you were settling

16:42.254 --> 16:49.524
down a little bit? When we went to Hobbs and Joe 
decided to leave and go independent, then we

16:49.545 --> 16:52.389
pretty much did what we did. Yeah, we bought a house 
and we pretty much settled down. Now, as an

16:56.735 --> 17:04.827
independent consultant geologist type in those 
days, was that kind of a boom and bust business?

17:04.927 --> 17:08.792
Well, it depends on how you did it. Actually, we 
saw... fluctuations in the price of oil and the

17:11.144 --> 17:23.080
activity, but we were never busted.

17:23.320 --> 17:24.842
Yeah, that's true.

17:27.766 --> 17:32.072
We pretty much had a gradual increase in Well,

17:32.744 --> 18:02.059
I'd say that

17:32.744 --> 18:02.059
basically,

17:32.744 --> 18:02.059
if you look at the long-range planning,

17:32.744 --> 18:02.059
the ups and downs, they are a foolish thing, just 
like the stock market, but we would never call it

17:32.744 --> 18:02.059
that. During those years, how about A&M? When did 
you begin to get loose into the A&M? Well, I, in the

18:08.972 --> 18:16.102
earlier days, well, I say not the earlier days, I 
say the middle. I got to hear too much about A&M. As a

18:19.106 --> 18:23.052
result, we only had one son go to school there. And I 
don't know if it's because they, you know, hurt so

18:23.493 --> 18:27.799
much of it. Yeah.

18:30.980 --> 18:33.322
Were you active in A&M activity? I guess there were 
a lot of Aggies with you in the business, probably.

18:37.607 --> 18:38.127
Well, yes. Actually, in living, I had four 
classmates that lived there at the time. Three of

18:46.295 --> 18:50.019
us were in . When we got started with A&M, I suppose I 
actually started it because the Southwest We

19:01.962 --> 19:14.558
started A&M Club as a lot of clubs started by having 
a muster. We had a muster of our house. Oh, okay. Is

19:17.041 --> 19:17.442
that right? And we invited some of the A&M people 
that we knew. Was that in Hobbs? Yes. And that club

19:23.710 --> 19:29.998
that we started, there was a couple other Aggies 
living there. My favorite, he's still there. But

19:33.063 --> 19:52.548
anyhow,

19:33.063 --> 19:52.548
we would have a muster up there every year, and then 
I got involved in the association. I was in what

19:52.568 --> 20:00.218
they called the best Texas representative 
assembly at that time, and then finally got

19:52.568 --> 20:00.218
appointed

19:52.568 --> 20:00.218
to the assembly. Well, the president elected 
first, and then the president, then the pastor.

20:04.752 --> 20:12.940
And then he was on the Development

20:04.752 --> 20:12.940
Foundation seven years. Well, I began to learn to 
like it. After a while. Let's say you couldn't help

20:16.004 --> 20:20.468
but like it. Well, Joe was a charter member of the 
12th man, you know, with that thing. It was so

20:25.454 --> 20:27.976
small, maybe we could meet over in the kitchen. 
Yeah. We saw both, at

20:31.012 --> 20:51.482
that

20:31.012 --> 20:51.482
time, the former Student Association and the 
Haggard

20:31.012 --> 20:51.482
Club, we saw them develop and improve almost every 
year. And right now, they're just 100,000 percent

20:51.502 --> 20:56.029
better than they used to start there, because they 
make improvements every year. It's really

20:56.049 --> 20:58.352
impressive, you know, the non-exemption student 
student out there. Who do you attribute mostly? Is

21:01.060 --> 21:08.270
it any single person, or the former students, or to 
that kind of organization development of that

21:01.060 --> 21:08.270
association? Those are unique associations. 
Actually, they started improving the

21:10.653 --> 21:23.530
association at the time that the Aggie jokes were 
being told, and it was affecting the students

21:23.999 --> 21:45.427
coming in, and I'd say that Bob Latimer was present 
at that time, and they made an effort to send the

21:23.999 --> 21:45.427
students out to the high schools and so forth. They 
started selling the program. You see, the whole

21:47.269 --> 21:47.830
thing The difference in the early days

21:49.058 --> 22:14.841
on the Student Association was they used to have 
meetings, and they called

21:49.058 --> 22:14.841
them BB meetings,

21:49.058 --> 22:14.841
Beer and Blame. And a lot of them, let's say Jim 
Sewell would come to the early ones, and later Jim

22:14.861 --> 22:17.023
Harvey Cash. And they thought only of improving 
the association to help the image of A&M. And they

22:25.634 --> 22:34.270
started improving the, what do you call it, the 
text society, the magazine. I've been in a lot of

22:34.722 --> 22:38.107
complaints about it, really. And I guess Jerry 
Cooper came in about that time, too, right? That's

22:42.775 --> 22:43.416
right. I'm always admiring Buck Wirons, too. Yes. 
They actually, about the time, in the early days,

22:48.524 --> 23:02.046
they kind of started working on the fundraiser. 
and having programs. The first program was

23:04.369 --> 23:18.373
probably the fundraiser, but they started going 
into other programs to improve the image and

23:04.369 --> 23:18.373
combat the bad Aggie jokes. For a while, they 
actually affected the senior partners in high

23:18.473 --> 23:24.764
school. But anyhow, then for some reason later on, 
A&M got real popular for seniors to come to. And all

23:38.750 --> 23:54.426
the programs that Jack Williams probably had more 
to do with

23:38.750 --> 23:54.426
telling students what to tell. Let's

23:55.132 --> 24:12.376
talk about, I guess, that time period now when the 
A&M Press is getting ready to get started.

24:15.520 --> 24:22.810
What is your, I guess, let's see, I'm not sure where 
to start it and you can bring things in, but what is

24:15.520 --> 24:22.810
your first recollection I'm hearing about him 
technically in the American press. Yes. Yes. I

24:30.821 --> 24:42.574
think that at that time, this would have been 74, 
and

24:30.821 --> 24:42.574
I had been president of the association in 72. 
Okay.

24:46.698 --> 24:48.420
I'm not sure of those dates. I'll check it. I know 
that I was president in 1974. because at that time

24:54.481 --> 24:58.970
they started having models.

25:00.793 --> 25:06.905
I remember that Bob Latimer said we're going to get 
better every year. Just before me,

25:07.747 --> 25:17.265
Melvin Moss, he had a slogan of a better 
communication between the students and alumni

25:17.836 --> 25:26.452
and administration. My field was more dull in 74. I 
remember I was in 74. But anyhow, all of the

25:36.611 --> 25:41.059
programs at that time started improving and 
getting, actually we were getting to get the

25:41.495 --> 25:51.607
better quality of people coming in, instead of 
just the rah-rah. We used to go in the rah-rah sock

25:51.627 --> 25:52.508
booth. We've been out there 15 years, I can't say 
that. Anyhow, the first time that we saw Frank

25:55.992 --> 26:07.806
Wardle, he and Jack and several others, I asked 
them, I don't know whether it was Bob Walker or

26:08.917 --> 26:16.083
Randy Mattson. They flew out to Amarillo to talk 
with Harold Dunn. You know Harold Dunn? Yeah, I

26:24.010 --> 26:25.131
know. In fact, there's a letter in the files about 
the same time. And they, French, had been aware of a

26:30.316 --> 26:37.422
young artist that lived in Sweetwater, and had 
made some paintings of West Texas

26:38.465 --> 26:59.132
ranches and so forth, and this fellow in Fort Worth 
had told Frank about this fellow at one of the

26:38.465 --> 26:59.132
museums. But anyhow, they flew out there and made 
the pitch to Harold Dunn to put up some money for the

27:09.025 --> 27:37.277
book series and harold at that time said that he

27:09.025 --> 27:37.277
was kind of closing out his estate or something and 
they were flying back from amarillo and they said

27:09.025 --> 27:37.277
let's stop by and see joe moore and we just happened 
to be there, we actually were staying in two motel

27:38.523 --> 27:43.449
rooms. We had two motel rooms side to side. And we, 
at that time, we had built a house at Lakewood. We

27:54.223 --> 27:56.846
built a house there in 72. Out here on the lake. For 
some reason, we were back in Midland, so they got in

27:59.971 --> 28:06.682
touch with us. I don't know exactly how, but they 
decided to stop by and talk to us. And I can remember

28:10.749 --> 28:15.096
that we were in the hotel room there. We were all, 
they had a whole bunch of these pictures. It was

28:18.982 --> 28:21.787
really interesting. The ones that Mondo Rogers 
had done. And we were in it. And he had no idea. But

28:30.649 --> 28:39.340
the thing that impressed me was the enthusiasm 
that Wardlock showed. You could just tell that he

28:40.281 --> 28:44.466
was a success. And Jack was very enthused. And they 
just said they didn't have a choice but to look at it

28:47.390 --> 28:51.595
and think about it. What else do you remember about 
the meeting? But I remember there was lots of

28:55.723 --> 28:57.445
people in there. For some reason, we got two rooms 
because some of our family was not living in

28:57.465 --> 29:05.714
Midland, and they were there together with us. 
We'd gone back to... Our office was still there,

29:06.915 --> 29:11.840
but I wasn't running.

29:16.345 --> 29:18.828
What do you remember about the meeting? That's 
what I remember. I remember we just had so much fun.

29:22.861 --> 29:28.448
looking at those pictures, all in a lot of 
excitement. And we were thinking more about this

29:28.468 --> 29:33.133
building than anything else. So anyhow. Let me ask 
you, too. What did you think about Wardlaw when you

29:37.178 --> 29:40.882
first met him? That was your first encounter with 
Frank Wardlaw? He was the most enthusiastic guy.

29:45.988 --> 29:49.433
You've got to have enthusiasm for anything. He was 
sincere. funny, I mean, lovable, and we might have

29:50.958 --> 29:59.272
had a few groups up there. I'm sure you did. I'm sure 
you did. Maybe you say what you thought. Now, that

30:05.603 --> 30:15.801
was my impression that made me really 
enthusiastic

30:05.603 --> 30:15.801
about the project. Well, I thought that Jack 
Williams felt the same way as Frank did, and I

30:16.625 --> 30:28.384
thought, well, Jack Williams got to be the 
balance, because here's Frank, all enthusiasm,

30:16.625 --> 30:28.384
but somebody else, you know. And then I guess we 
decided in two or three days. Well, I think we

30:32.551 --> 30:34.575
decided that night. But we told him. Yeah, a little 
bit later. That's correct. If I remember right,

30:39.187 --> 30:57.413
Jack Williams told us that to have a great 
university, you need a great press and a great

30:39.187 --> 30:57.413
person, so you've got to have a great library and a 
great scholarly press. And I'd say that'd be

30:58.435 --> 31:02.761
impressive. But they left the pictures with us, I 
believe. We told them that we'd give them an answer

31:07.216 --> 31:12.892
in a day or two if we'd go out to dinner with us. Did 
they go? I didn't remember that, but Haskell said

31:14.617 --> 31:18.528
that they stayed. Haskell wouldn't remember. He 
really remembered everything. We

31:26.596 --> 31:34.290
talked to those women. I believe they said it cost 
$75,000.
