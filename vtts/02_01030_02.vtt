00:11.253 --> 00:36.450
I saw her through the window today She was sitting 
in the Silver Spoon Cafe I started to keep going but

00:11.253 --> 00:36.450
something made me stop

00:11.253 --> 00:36.450
She used to love me a lot She looked lonely and I knew 
the cure Old memories would win her heart for sure.

00:43.367 --> 00:50.194
I thought I'd walk on in there and give it my best 
shot. She used to love me a lot.

00:58.022 --> 01:02.767
Sat down beside her and she smiled. Said, where 
have you been? It's been a while. She seemed so glad

01:07.480 --> 01:35.108
to see me Lord, I could read her thoughts She used to 
love me a lot

01:07.480 --> 01:35.108
She used to love me with a love that wouldn't die 
Looking at her now, I can't believe I said goodbye

01:07.480 --> 01:35.108
It would only take a minute to turn back the clock 
She used to love me a lot.

01:44.972 --> 01:50.181
Well, I reminded her how good it was back then. And I 
said, you know, it's not too late to start again. We

01:54.528 --> 01:59.357
could spend the night together, take up where we 
left off.

02:06.138 --> 02:09.223
Then I panicked as she turned to walk away. As she 
went out the door, I heard her say, yes, I'm in need

02:11.125 --> 02:22.983
of something, but it's something you ain't got. 
But I used to love you a lot. She used to love me with a

02:28.058 --> 02:32.003
love that wouldn't die. Looking at her now, I can't 
believe she said goodbye. It would only take a

02:38.873 --> 02:46.523
minute to turn back that old clock.

03:02.264 --> 03:31.275
But

03:02.264 --> 03:31.275
Lisa lost her smile

03:33.567 --> 04:03.017
Painter's hands are trembling now And if she's out 
there running wild It's just because I taught her

03:33.567 --> 04:03.017
how The masterpiece that we had planned Is laying 
shattered on the ground

03:33.567 --> 04:03.017
Mona Lisa lost her smile And the painter's hands 
are trembling now

04:04.432 --> 04:33.713
And the eyes that used to burn for me

04:04.432 --> 04:33.713
Now they no longer look my way

04:04.432 --> 04:33.713
And the love that used to be Why it just got lost in 
yesterday

04:04.432 --> 04:33.713
And if she seems cold to the touch

04:36.308 --> 04:51.945
Well, there used to burn a flame I gave too little, 
took too much

04:36.308 --> 04:51.945
Shall I erase the painter's name?

04:51.965 --> 05:05.320
Oh, Lisa lost her smile The painter's hands are 
trembling now And if she's out there running wild

05:07.088 --> 05:31.273
It's just because I taught her how The masterpiece 
that we had

05:07.088 --> 05:31.273
planned Is laying shattered on the ground

05:07.088 --> 05:31.273
Mona Lisa lost her smile

05:07.088 --> 05:31.273
And the painter's hands are trembling now

05:53.039 --> 06:21.780
Mona Lisa lost her smile

05:53.039 --> 06:21.780
And the painter's hands are trembling now And if 
she's out there running wild It's just because I

05:53.039 --> 06:21.780
taught her how In the masterpiece that we had 
planned It's laying there shattered on the ground

06:25.220 --> 06:34.082
Mona Lisa lost her smile And the painter's hands 
are trembling now

07:05.399 --> 07:07.242
Well, I was thumbing from Montgomery. I had my 
guitar on my back when a stranger stopped beside me

07:08.384 --> 07:16.336
in an antique Cadillac. He was dressed like 1950, 
half drunk and hollow eyed. He said, it's a long

07:22.045 --> 07:24.529
walk to Nashville. Would you like to ride?

07:33.631 --> 07:58.997
i sat down in the front seat he turned on the radio 
and them sad old songs coming out of them speakers

07:33.631 --> 07:58.997
was solid country gold then i noticed the stranger 
was ghost white pear when he asked me for a light and

07:33.631 --> 07:58.997
i knew there was something strange about this ride 
he said drifter can you make folks cry

08:02.673 --> 08:04.115
Have you paid your dues? Can you mow the blues? Can 
you bend down guitar strings? He said, boy, can you

08:08.399 --> 08:13.404
make folks feel what you feel inside? Cause if 
you're big star bound, let me warn you, it's a long,

08:13.625 --> 08:26.058
hard

08:13.625 --> 08:26.058
ride.

08:26.078 --> 08:31.043
Then he cried just south of Nashville, and he 
turned that car around. He said, this is where you

08:31.647 --> 08:36.754
get off, boy, because I'm going back to Alabama. As 
I stepped out of that Cadillac, I said, mister,

08:38.476 --> 08:44.284
many thanks. He said, you don't have to call me 
mister, mister.

08:49.311 --> 08:50.813
The whole world called me Hank. He said, can you 
make it 45 in your

08:55.829 --> 09:16.926
¶¶ ¶¶ ¶¶ ¶¶

09:18.442 --> 09:21.809
Have you paid your dues? Can you call the police? 
Can you open up your door screen? He said, boy, can

09:24.454 --> 09:28.101
you make folks feel what you feel inside? Well, if 
you're big star bound, let me warn you, it's a long,

09:30.105 --> 09:36.037
hard ride. If you're big star bound, let me warn 
you, it's a long, hard ride.

10:05.152 --> 10:28.206
Now I lay me down to cheat

10:05.152 --> 10:28.206
On the woman I love so And if I die between these 
sheets I pray to God she'll never know

10:34.514 --> 10:37.799
She's the best thing in his life. Why she worships 
the ground he walks on.

10:46.332 --> 10:58.250
She waits up for him at night and worries until he's 
safely

10:46.332 --> 10:58.250
home. She always believes his stories about 
working overtime. And in 20 years beside him,

11:04.383 --> 11:17.160
cheating's never crossed her mind.

11:18.122 --> 11:30.238
Oh, but it crossed his early last summer in the 
person of a neighbor she still calls her friend.

11:33.391 --> 11:39.598
And with a little push from drinking one too many, 
one night in the fall, he gave in. And now, he wishes

11:39.618 --> 11:45.744
he could stop himself, but there's no easy way. So 
he lays down with his lover, and silently he prays.

11:52.171 --> 11:59.719
Now I lay me down to

11:52.171 --> 11:59.719
cheat on the one

12:04.711 --> 12:26.702
If I die between these sheets

12:04.711 --> 12:26.702
I pray to God she'll never

12:04.711 --> 12:26.702
know In his heart and soul He knew that he was 
playing a game he could never win

12:30.395 --> 12:33.499
But you know, forbidden fruit is sweet.

12:36.804 --> 12:39.568
Why, it was sweet enough to make him risk it all 
again.

12:46.538 --> 12:50.764
And now, he's given up on looking for a way to fight 
the feeling. So he prays this simple prayer and

12:52.186 --> 12:57.634
hopes it makes it past the motel ceiling.

13:05.107 --> 13:22.592
On the woman

13:05.107 --> 13:22.592
I love so And if I die between these sheets

13:05.107 --> 13:22.592
I pray to God she'll never know

13:44.138 --> 14:08.593
I used to spend my nights out in a ballroom

13:44.138 --> 14:08.593
Liquor was the only love I'd known

13:44.138 --> 14:08.593
But you rescued me from reaching for the bottom

14:12.117 --> 14:41.230
Brought me back from being too far gone

14:12.117 --> 14:41.230
You're as smooth

14:12.117 --> 14:41.230
as Tennessee whiskey

14:12.117 --> 14:41.230
You're as sweet as strawberry wine

14:12.117 --> 14:41.230
You're as warm

14:43.505 --> 14:55.573
And

14:43.505 --> 14:55.573
I stay stoned on your love all the time

15:07.501 --> 15:32.412
I looked for love in all the same old places

15:07.501 --> 15:32.412
Found the bottom of the bottles always dry

15:07.501 --> 15:32.412
But when you poured out your heart I didn't waste it 
Cause there's nothing like your love to get me high

15:35.007 --> 16:04.828
You're as

15:35.007 --> 16:04.828
smooth as Tennessee whiskey

15:35.007 --> 16:04.828
You're as sweet as strawberry wine

15:35.007 --> 16:04.828
You're as warm

16:08.065 --> 16:26.884
And

16:08.065 --> 16:26.884
I stay stoned on your love all the time

16:08.065 --> 16:26.884
I stay stoned on your love all the time

16:44.667 --> 16:49.732
The old man was covered with tattoos and scars. He 
got some in prison and others in bars. The rest he

16:53.356 --> 16:59.422
got working on old junk cars in the daytime. They 
looked like tombstones in our yard, and I never

16:59.442 --> 17:07.730
seen him when he wasn't tired and mean. He sold used 
parts to make ends meet. Covered with grease from

17:10.992 --> 17:19.261
his head to his feet, cussing the sweat and the 
Texas heat and mosquitoes. And the neighbors said

17:19.281 --> 17:27.090
we lived like hicks, but they brung their cars for 
Paul to fix anyhow. He was veteran proud, tried and

17:27.110 --> 17:29.473
true. He'd fought till his heart was black and 
blue. Didn't know how he'd made it through the hard

17:33.477 --> 17:37.101
times. He bought our house on the GI Bill, but it 
wasn't worth all he had to kill to get it. He drank

17:45.966 --> 17:57.316
Pearl in a can of Jack Daniels Black, chewed 
tobacco from a mail pouch sack, had an old dog that

17:45.966 --> 17:57.316
was trained to attack sometimes. He'd get drunk 
and mean as a rattlesnake, and there wasn't too

17:57.336 --> 18:05.383
much that he would take from a stranger. There were 
13 kids House full of chickens and a yard full of

18:08.215 --> 18:10.898
hogs. I spent the summertime cutting up logs for 
the winter. Trying like the devil to find the Lord.

18:18.887 --> 18:21.429
Working like a nigger from my room and board. Coal 
burning stove, no natural gas. If that ain't

18:24.633 --> 18:28.437
country, I'll kiss your ass. If that ain't 
country, it'll hair lift the Pope. If that ain't

18:34.083 --> 18:37.767
country, it's a damn good joke. I've seen the Grand 
Ole Opry And I met Johnny Cash If that ain't country

18:38.827 --> 18:49.815
I'll kiss your ass

19:02.553 --> 19:04.776
Mama sells eggs at the grocery store. My oldest 
sister is a first-rate whore. Dad says she can't

19:07.639 --> 19:10.662
come home anymore. He means it. Ma just sits and 
keeps her silence. Sister, she left cause Dad got

19:15.808 --> 19:21.314
violent and he knows it. Mama, she's old far beyond 
her time. From chopping tobacco and I seen her

19:23.777 --> 19:26.340
crying. When blood started flowing from her 
calloused hand and it hurt me. She just keep

19:31.730 --> 19:38.040
working, trying to help the old man to the end of one 
row and back again, like always. She's been

19:39.703 --> 19:42.448
through hell since Junior went to jail. When the 
lights go out, she ain't never failed to get down on

19:42.468 --> 19:48.878
her knees and pray because she loves him. I told all 
the neighbors he was off in the war fighting for

19:50.512 --> 19:54.376
freedom. He's good to the core and she's proud. Now 
our place was a graveyard for automobiles. At the

20:01.023 --> 20:06.308
end of the porch there was four stacks of wheels and 
tires for sale for a dollar or two. Cash. There was

20:08.951 --> 20:12.194
50 holes in an old tin roof. Me and my family was 
living proof. The people who forgot about poor

20:14.857 --> 20:19.742
white trash and if that ain't country I'll keep 
track. If that ain't

20:21.106 --> 20:35.810
country, it'll hair lift the Pope. If that ain't 
country, it's a damn good joke. I've seen the grand

20:36.751 --> 20:40.517
old I-3, and I've met Johnny Cash. If that ain't 
country, I'll kiss your ass. I'm thinking tonight

20:46.387 --> 20:48.430
of my new house. I didn't

20:49.135 --> 21:03.533
know God made honky tonk angels and went back to the 
wild side of life.

21:39.254 --> 21:43.200
Country DJs knows that I'm an outlaw. They'd never 
come to see me in this dive. Where bikers stare at

21:49.228 --> 21:58.461
cowboys who are laughing at the hippies who are 
praying they'll get out of here alive. Loudmouth

22:00.466 --> 22:29.967
in the corner's getting to me Talking about my 
earrings and my hair I guess he ain't read the signs

22:00.466 --> 22:29.967
that say I've been to prison Someone oughta warn 
him before I knock him off his chair Cause my long

22:00.466 --> 22:29.967
hair just can't cover up my redneck I've won every 
fight I've ever fought And I don't need some turkey

22:31.465 --> 22:36.212
telling me that I ain't country. Saying I ain't 
worth the damn dough ticket that he bought. Cause I

22:42.201 --> 22:51.854
can sing all them songs about Texas.

22:51.875 --> 22:56.301
And I still do all the sad ones that I know. They tell 
me I looked like Merle Haggard

23:00.743 --> 23:23.545
And sound a lot like David Allen Cole And the 
barmaid in the last town that we played in Knew the

23:00.743 --> 23:23.545
words to every song I'd wrote She said Jimmy Rabbit 
turned her on to my last album. Just about the time

23:30.952 --> 23:34.036
the jukebox broke. Yeah, Johnny Cash helped me get 
out of prison. Long before Rodriguez stole that

23:41.447 --> 23:44.892
goat. I've been the rhinestone cowboy for so long I 
can't remember And I can do ya every song Hank

23:46.475 --> 24:15.452
Williams ever wrote And I can sing all them songs 
about Texas

23:46.475 --> 24:15.452
And I still do all the sad ones

23:46.475 --> 24:15.452
that I know I can't help it I look like Merle Haggard

24:15.601 --> 24:39.347
And I sound a lot like David Allen Cole But the 
country DJs all think I'm an outlaw And they'd

24:15.601 --> 24:39.347
never come to see me in this dive Where bikers stare 
at cowboys who are laughing at the hippies who are

24:40.002 --> 24:52.120
praying they'll get out of here

24:40.002 --> 24:52.120
alive. The loud mouth in the corner is getting to 
me. Talking about my earrings and my hair.

25:18.207 --> 25:46.223
Jody like a melody you play inside my head Tell the 
thought of you is more than I can stand Just to think

25:18.207 --> 25:46.223
of having you is music to my soul You make me feel as 
though the world is in my hands Jody like a melody

25:18.207 --> 25:46.223
you warm me and then leave me with a chill

25:50.354 --> 25:58.931
I can't believe the sun will rise without me 
looking in your eyes and knowing that your love has

25:50.354 --> 25:58.931
made me strong. Why you left I'll never know. The 
fire you built will always glow. I only know I won't

26:06.306 --> 26:09.612
find you gone. Jody, like a melody, warm me and then 
leave me with a chill

26:11.397 --> 26:34.097
Jody,

26:11.397 --> 26:34.097
I can't keep my thoughts about me in the daytime 
When your memory's enough to make me blind And late

26:35.258 --> 26:39.728
at night I lie awake and wait for you to come. And 
when you don't, you know I almost lose my mind.

26:45.561 --> 26:51.073
Jody, like a melody, you want me and then leave me 
with you.

27:15.421 --> 27:38.863
Jody

27:15.421 --> 27:38.863
like a melody Jody like a melody Jody like a melody 
Jody like a melody Jody like a melody Jody like a

27:15.421 --> 27:38.863
melody

27:54.487 --> 27:58.725
Jody rockin' the low key

28:25.908 --> 28:30.675
Please come to Boston for the springtime.

28:32.618 --> 28:37.586
I'm staying here with some friends and they've got 
lots of room. You can sell your paintings on the

28:39.869 --> 28:46.139
sidewalk.

28:46.159 --> 28:52.388
Buy a cafe where I hope to be working soon. Please 
come to Boston. She said, no, David, you come home

28:56.187 --> 29:02.717
to me. And she said, hey, Ramson boy, why don't you 
settle down? Boston ain't your kind of town. There

29:10.128 --> 29:11.550
ain't no going. There ain't nobody like me. I'm the 
number one fan of the man from Tennessee.

29:34.201 --> 30:00.259
Please come to Denver with the snowfall

29:34.201 --> 30:00.259
We'll move up into the mountains so far that we 
can't be found And throw our love you echoes down

29:34.201 --> 30:00.259
the canyon And then lie awake at night till they 
come back around Please come to Denver, she said,

30:01.690 --> 30:10.602
no, you come home with me. And she said, hey, 
ramblin' boy, why don't you settle down? Denver

30:15.890 --> 30:18.313
ain't your kind of town. There ain't no gold and 
there ain't nobody like me. I'm the number one fan

30:24.782 --> 30:29.689
of the man from Tennessee.

30:34.647 --> 31:00.317
Now this drifter's world goes round and round And I 
doubt if it's ever gonna stop But of all the dreams

30:34.647 --> 31:00.317
I've lost and found And all that I ain't got I still 
need to lean to Somebody I can sing to

30:34.647 --> 31:00.317
Please come to L.A. to live forever

31:02.440 --> 31:30.642
California life alone is just too hard to build I 
live in a house that looks out over the ocean And

31:02.440 --> 31:30.642
there's some stars that fell from the sky Living up 
on the hill Please come to L.A. She just said no

31:02.440 --> 31:30.642
David, you come home to me And she said, hey, 
ramblin' boy, why don't you settle down? L.A.

31:36.091 --> 31:38.917
ain't your kind of town. There ain't no gold and 
there ain't no butter like me. I'm the number one

31:45.390 --> 31:50.200
fan of the man from Tennessee.

32:02.650 --> 32:10.921
Please come to Boston.

come to

32:11.001 --> 32:31.307
Boston.

32:36.805 --> 32:46.838
Well, it was all that I could do to keep from crying.

32:46.858 --> 32:56.770
Sometimes it seems so useless to remain.

32:56.790 --> 33:04.720
But you don't have to call me darling, darling. You 
never even called me by my name

33:06.067 --> 33:31.618
You don't have to call me Waylon Jennings

33:06.067 --> 33:31.618
And you don't have to call me Charlie Price

33:34.248 --> 33:59.023
And you don't have to call me Merle Haggard anymore

33:34.248 --> 33:59.023
Even though you're on my

33:34.248 --> 33:59.023
fighting side And I'll hang around as long as you 
will let me

34:05.095 --> 34:31.947
Standing in

34:05.095 --> 34:31.947
the rain But you don't have

34:05.095 --> 34:31.947
to call me darling Darling You never even call me by 
my

34:05.095 --> 34:31.947
name Well, I've heard my name A few times in your 
phone book

34:32.652 --> 34:56.685
And I've seen

34:32.652 --> 34:56.685
it on songs where I play But the

34:32.652 --> 34:56.685
only time I know I'll hear David Allen call

34:59.483 --> 35:20.985
As long

34:59.483 --> 35:20.985
as you will let me

34:59.483 --> 35:20.985
And I never Minded standing In the rain

35:25.015 --> 35:34.146
But you don't have to call me darling, darling. You 
never even call me by my name. Well, a friend of mine

35:43.297 --> 35:47.021
named Steve Goodman wrote that song. And he told me 
it was the perfect country and western song. I

35:51.408 --> 36:09.754
wrote him back a letter and I told him it was not the 
perfect country and western song because he

35:51.408 --> 36:09.754
hadn't said anything at all about mama or trains or 
trucks or presents or getting drunk. Well, he sat

36:09.774 --> 36:20.048
down and wrote another verse to the song and he sent 
it to me and after reading it I realized that my

36:09.774 --> 36:20.048
friend had written the perfect country and 
western song. And I felt obliged to include it on

36:20.568 --> 36:23.073
this album. The last verse goes like this here. I 
was drunk the day my mom got out of prison.

36:37.725 --> 36:40.872
And I went to pick her up.

36:46.589 --> 37:10.437
But

36:46.589 --> 37:10.437
before I could

36:46.589 --> 37:10.437
get to the station in the pickup truck She got

36:46.589 --> 37:10.437
run over by a damned old train And I'll hang around 
as long as you will let me

37:13.910 --> 37:30.345
And

37:13.910 --> 37:30.345
I never

37:13.910 --> 37:30.345
minded standing in the rain.

37:32.848 --> 37:37.852
Oh, you don't have to call me darling. Darling, you 
never even call me. Well, I wonder why you don't

37:40.355 --> 37:43.117
call me. Why don't you ever call me?

38:05.007 --> 38:11.276
Last week he spent his whole paycheck on whiskey.

38:13.400 --> 38:21.632
I know Friday night he'll do it all again.

38:21.652 --> 38:25.037
Oh, he'll drink till he falls down. Then he'll 
order one more round and then go home with That

38:32.615 --> 38:55.500
bottle in his hand And the only thing I can hold on to 
Is this bottle in my hand I know I'll never have to

38:32.615 --> 38:55.500
share it With any other man I'm so glad you 
introduced us And I'll do the best I can To be

38:57.505 --> 39:17.725
faithful to this bottle in my hand

39:22.919 --> 39:31.054
She told George that changing diapers could sure 
become a drag. And to clean the house and cook for

39:31.475 --> 39:39.671
him was not her kind of bag. She said he needed 
someone who And she loved him with that bottle in

39:45.042 --> 40:12.383
his hand And the only thing I can count on now is this 
bottle in my hand I know I'll never have to share it

39:45.042 --> 40:12.383
with any other man And I'm so glad you introduced us 
Oh, I'll do the best I can To be faithful to this

40:14.945 --> 40:43.720
bottle in my hand Yes, we'll be faithful to this 
bottle in our

40:14.945 --> 40:43.720
hand

40:59.005 --> 41:19.545
Would you lay with me In a field of stone If my needs 
were strong Would you lay with me

41:24.301 --> 41:53.852
Should my lips grow dry Would you wet them dear In 
the midnight hour Should my lips grow dry Would you

41:24.301 --> 41:53.852
go away

41:24.301 --> 41:53.852
To another land Walk a thousand miles Through the 
burn

41:58.338 --> 42:13.579
Wipe the blood away from my dying hand If I give 
myself to you

42:39.108 --> 42:56.448
In my

42:39.108 --> 42:56.448
time

42:39.108 --> 42:56.448
of trouble Will you stand by me? Would you go away To 
another land? Walk a thousand miles Through the

42:57.349 --> 43:07.461
burning sand And wipe the blood away From my dying 
hand

43:09.196 --> 43:34.697
If I give myself to you Would you lay with me In a 
field of stone If my needs were strong Would you lay

43:35.926 --> 43:45.283
with me?

43:45.303 --> 43:53.017
Jack Daniels, if you please, knock me to my knees.

43:55.461 --> 43:59.689
You're the only friend there has ever been.

44:04.310 --> 44:09.878
Jack Daniels, if you please. Knock me to my

44:09.898 --> 44:14.946
knees. You can kill this pain. It's driving me 
insane. Since my baby's gone.

44:23.739 --> 44:28.847
Cigarettes and whiskey.

44:28.867 --> 44:31.110
Call my shaking hand. I just lost a lover

44:33.520 --> 44:59.494
To a one night stand

44:33.520 --> 44:59.494
Something temporary

44:33.520 --> 44:59.494
Too late I had learned

44:33.520 --> 44:59.494
Someone from the past Said it couldn't last A 
bridge she could burn Jack Daniels, if

45:01.111 --> 45:11.345
you please knock me to my knees. You're the only 
friend there has ever been that didn't do me wrong.

45:20.297 --> 45:26.545
Jack Daniels, if you please knock me to my knees.

45:30.338 --> 45:32.662
You can kill this pain. It's driving me insane 
since my baby's gone.

45:39.813 --> 45:44.821
Promises were broken.

45:44.841 --> 45:49.809
Dreams were left to

45:44.841 --> 45:49.809
die. Empty words were spoken.

45:54.356 --> 45:56.059
Tears were in our eyes.

45:58.992 --> 46:26.333
Something

45:58.992 --> 46:26.333
temporary Those tears will fade away Do

45:58.992 --> 46:26.333
the

45:58.992 --> 46:26.333
best you can Help me understand These games that 
people play Jack Daniels, if you please Knock me to

45:58.992 --> 46:26.333
my knees You're the only friend there has ever been 
That didn't do me wrong Jack Daniels, if you please

46:27.173 --> 46:53.198
Knock me to my knees You can kill this pain It's 
drivin' me insane Since my baby's gone

46:55.777 --> 46:57.860
You can kill this pain. It's driving me insane. 
Since my baby's gone.

47:06.314 --> 47:10.100
Take this job and shove it. I ain't working here no 
more. My woman died and left and took all of the

47:15.709 --> 47:22.240
reasons I was working for her. You better not try to 
stand in my way When I walk out the door Take this job

47:24.953 --> 47:54.910
and shove it I ain't working here no more

47:24.953 --> 47:54.910
I've been working in this factory Pretty close to 
15 years I've seen some of my best friends' women

47:55.328 --> 48:21.015
Standing in a pool of tears I've seen a lot of 
kinfolks dying Had a lot of bills to pay Lord, I'd

47:55.328 --> 48:21.015
give the shirt right off in my bag If I had the guts to 
say Take this job and shove it I ain't a-workin'

47:55.328 --> 48:21.015
here no more And took all of the reasons I was 
working for You

48:23.071 --> 48:43.628
better not try to stand in my way When I walk out the 
door Take this job and shove it I ain't working

48:50.560 --> 48:54.047
Performing is a regular S.O.B. and the line boss, 
he's a fool. He got himself a brand new flat top

48:58.255 --> 49:02.202
haircut. Lord, he really thinks that's cool. One 
of these days I'm gonna blow my top and there's

49:06.190 --> 49:12.602
gonna be hell to pay. I can't wait to see their faces 
When I get the nerve to say Take this job and shove it

49:13.443 --> 49:35.569
I ain't a-workin' here no more A woman done left and 
took all of the reasons I was working for

49:38.198 --> 49:45.832
Better not try to stand in my way when I walk out the 
door. Take this job and shove it. I ain't working

49:49.438 --> 49:53.025
here no more. Take this job and

49:53.045 --> 50:02.502
shove it.

50:10.480 --> 50:37.433
I heard the burritos out in California Could fly 
higher than the birds Roger McGuinn had a

50:10.480 --> 50:37.433
twelve-string guitar It was like nothing I'd ever 
heard And eagles flew in from the west coast Like

50:10.480 --> 50:37.433
the birds they were trying to be Well, in Texas, the 
tough turn to outlaw Like Willie and Waylon and me

50:38.864 --> 50:52.765
Hey! Well, they say Texas music's in the make And 
we've been making music that is free Doing

50:52.785 --> 51:07.487
one-night stands, playing with our bands Willie, 
Waylon, and me Oh!

51:29.573 --> 51:36.364
They say the Beatles were just the beginning of 
everything music could be. Just like the stones I

51:38.206 --> 51:44.997
was rolling along, like a ship lost out on the sea. 
And Joplin would die for the future, and Dylan

51:46.599 --> 51:53.370
would write poetry. And in Texas the talk turned 
out lost Like Willie and Waylon and me Hey, my name

51:54.464 --> 52:23.425
is David Allen Cole And I'm from Dallas, Texas They 
say Texas music's in the mix And we've been making

51:54.464 --> 52:23.425
music that is free Doing one night stands Playing 
with our bands Willie, Waylon and me Big Jim
