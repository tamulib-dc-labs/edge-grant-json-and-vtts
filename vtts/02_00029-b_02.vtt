00:01.930 --> 00:08.100
Fort

00:01.930 --> 00:08.100
Allbritton was a new member at that time. All 
right, let's back up to coeducation. Fort

00:10.880 --> 00:14.080
Allbritton was on in 73 because he was the one who 
was in particular. When the proposal about

00:15.340 --> 00:20.460
coeducation, non-compulsory core came up, do you 
have any idea what Mr. Rutter's initial reaction

00:20.700 --> 00:25.920
was? Do you have any idea whether he was for it or 
when it first came up? I would say Mr. Rutter

00:31.190 --> 00:35.150
probably wouldn't have expressed his initial 
reaction.

00:45.500 --> 00:49.570
I never heard any remark with it at all.

01:05.330 --> 01:13.330
But he

01:05.330 --> 01:13.330
was a very good decision-making type of person. He 
was the type of person that he maybe couldn't run

01:13.310 --> 01:18.990
all the alternatives to his mind at one time, but he 
could run enough through the decision and maybe it

01:19.010 --> 01:21.330
was pretty healthy. Let's see, let's go back to 
Austin. Which governors were most supportive of

01:26.180 --> 01:30.800
the work of the engineering Extension Service. 
I'd say Dolph Briscoe. Dolph Briscoe. The reason

01:35.514 --> 01:37.600
I'm saying that, Dolph Conner.

01:47.690 --> 01:54.650
Other than local legislators, were there any 
other legislators that were key supporters? Yes.

01:55.606 --> 01:55.691
Who? Senator. All right. Do you remember his first 
name? I don't. Grant. Grant Jones, that's right.

02:02.750 --> 02:03.391
Any others? Over the state? Mm-hmm. I can't call 
their names right now.

02:16.440 --> 02:17.821
I'll tell you, I have that thing. Whenever we had a 
budget, whenever they had the legislature, it was

02:20.260 --> 02:22.340
the House Appropriations Committee. I made it 
important that each one of them not only know me,

02:23.060 --> 02:27.840
but know my program. I didn't work with the higher 
education committees. I brought in all the new

02:32.760 --> 02:34.181
higher education. But I made sure that everybody 
on the Appropriations Committee knew me. And at

02:38.680 --> 02:42.000
that time, we all used to make presentations 
before they cut that out. They

02:42.440 --> 02:58.470
had this little representative from down

02:42.440 --> 02:58.470
in New Orleans, Falls County, whatever it is. He 
got to be a pretty good friend of mine, but that's

02:59.210 --> 03:01.550
good.

03:04.910 --> 03:05.811
I saw his name. The paper's a lobbyist now, by the 
way. Mm-hmm. Do you remember reading one of those?

03:09.450 --> 03:10.891
They all get to be lobbyists. Yeah. He was very much 
supportive, I think. Then we had a representative

03:14.710 --> 03:22.220
out of one of those Dallas towns, one of Cedar Hill, 
I don't know. But he was a volunteer for us, so he was

03:22.940 --> 03:27.830
very supportive. But I didn't know him very well. 
As you look back, what were your proudest moments

03:30.430 --> 03:38.700
with the Extension Service? The highlight events 
that you now remember. I guess the highlight, the

03:42.280 --> 03:46.380
things that I enjoyed most about it, the ability 
that we had complaints

03:47.380 --> 04:02.720
about our work over 19 years I was there.

04:10.390 --> 04:15.130
But my really highlights was, I figured that when 
you take an organization with 15 employees, you

04:15.230 --> 04:18.270
end up with 400, you own a self-support base of a 
million and a half, and you get it up to 39 million.

04:23.260 --> 04:28.970
And we carried, when I left that thing, I left over 
13 million in reserves. Mm, that's great. Okay.

04:33.313 --> 04:37.300
Now, let's turn to the amusing side. Can you think 
of some event that happened that was one of those

04:37.760 --> 04:44.970
Texas, unbelievable, something that maybe just 
went wrong, something just, the electricity went

04:45.210 --> 04:51.200
off? It was one of those, I know you won't believe 
this, but it really happened? No, I have one. Okay.

04:57.493 --> 04:59.060
I always had a State of the Union speech. We always 
had an annual conference, and I always gave a State

04:59.120 --> 05:02.940
of the Union message, okay? I always stressed the 
basics. And, of course,

05:06.360 --> 05:35.470
I had to,

05:06.360 --> 05:35.470
for some reason, I had to.

05:35.450 --> 05:43.750
I wasn't even close to the one I was talking about in 
front of all 400 people, you know. So they had a good

05:44.010 --> 05:45.031
laugh? They all had a good laugh. And, of course, I 
come back at them, and I said, now, Clara, the

05:46.710 --> 05:54.770
reason I did that, I just want to see it.

05:54.830 --> 05:55.252
Okay. Now, from all of your Aggie memories, either 
as a student, an employee, give me a funny Aggie

05:55.272 --> 06:02.690
story, and then maybe a sad. Okay. Or a poignant 
Aggie story. It could involve anything, anybody.

06:10.390 --> 06:12.530
Well, the saddest one, I can get that right off my 
chest. My roommate was in

06:13.530 --> 06:33.700
college.

06:33.880 --> 06:35.381
And you all were roommates for how long? Two years. 
Two years. But we was in the same outfit.

06:44.750 --> 06:45.221
Okay. Now some good Aggie fun. This is the biggest 
Aggie fun.

06:53.130 --> 07:00.730
Thanksgiving game in 1940, we made a touchdown, 
7-0, 30-40 seconds of play. We

07:01.250 --> 07:05.480
all hitchhiked into Austin. And my roommate at 
that time also was from O.T. Road. Which was about

07:14.410 --> 07:21.500
five or six of us, but downhearted, didn't mention 
it anymore. But anyway, we got out on Congress

07:21.480 --> 07:23.920
Avenue and started hitchhiking. We got picked up, 
right off, two cars, one stopped, another stopped

07:23.900 --> 07:28.740
right behind us. One had this Model 8 Ford with the 
little rumble seat in the back. I don't remember, I

07:31.260 --> 07:33.780
was in the rumble seat in the back. And they kept 
going out to Congress Avenue, you know, we told

07:33.760 --> 07:38.600
them, we don't want to get on the highway too late. 
But it was great, and they took us out about 10 miles

07:38.580 --> 07:47.260
out of town, and I'll bet you there was five other 
University of Texas people out there and about 50

07:38.580 --> 07:47.260
Aggies. And they would eat the hell out of us. With a 
paddle? No, with a fish. Oh, oh,

07:54.970 --> 07:59.010
oh. And that was quite funny. The reason that was 
funny, you think you're so damn stupid that you can

08:00.990 --> 08:05.010
get in a car like that. And the other one pertains to 
your Rice University group. Uh-oh, my freshman

08:07.990 --> 08:13.010
year, you know, we used to rent these cattle 
trailers to take us down to the court room. And so,

08:12.990 --> 08:18.010
our upperclassmen told us that they wanted us 
to... to all get together, freshmen, there was a

08:17.990 --> 08:26.570
whole bunch of us to get together as freshmen, and 
have Yelp practice right there at the entrance of

08:17.990 --> 08:26.570
the Rice Gate. Well,

08:26.550 --> 08:39.780
four of the five of us, we got out there early, and we 
was standing there, and all at once, about damn 15

08:26.550 --> 08:39.780
or 20 of these damn Rice Owls come out and grab us, 
take us up to the damn dormitory room, and paint a

08:39.760 --> 08:47.410
damn heart

08:39.760 --> 08:47.410
on our head. Okay. Uh, let's see. If you have any 
letters, diary, journal, or any personal items

08:50.510 --> 09:06.250
that you would ever be willing for the A&M Archives 
to copy, please do so. Not asking you to give it to

09:06.230 --> 09:10.250
them, because you might want to keep them in the 
family. But any time you have any papers that

09:10.230 --> 09:18.250
relate to your career, particularly as a student, 
and or as an employee, and if you have any letters

09:18.230 --> 09:26.440
that you wrote home from overseas, if you would 
let... I don't have any of those. Well, does

09:28.420 --> 09:30.440
anybody in the family have any? I doubt it. See, my 
family's all family. Because I thought if there

09:32.570 --> 09:35.590
was any V-mail or anything like that. But

09:35.570 --> 09:44.750
if

09:35.570 --> 09:44.750
you do... Because, you see, if we can gather all of 
those materials up, the more we can learn about

09:44.730 --> 09:53.750
this school, the better we can make it go in the 
future. The only thing that I've got, and I will go

09:53.730 --> 10:03.110
through my salary... Yeah, yeah,

10:03.090 --> 10:10.540
yeah. Okay, then the last thing. In your heart, 
now, as you look back, what parts of Texas A&M

10:12.520 --> 10:20.430
dearest to you? No, but what parts of the 
university?

10:26.560 --> 10:28.580
But if I were to come to you and ask... Oh, I think 
engineering. The engineering? Any particular

10:30.909 --> 10:34.310
part of engineering? No,

10:34.290 --> 11:25.320
I think

10:34.290 --> 11:25.320
the...

11:25.300 --> 11:27.540
Of course, agriculture has its problems. Or it did 
at that time. It was very strong. And you can see

11:32.170 --> 11:33.191
why. If you want an unhappy group of people, don't 
feel it. So whether you like them or don't like

11:42.360 --> 11:45.760
them, you've got to respect them. Pierce

11:45.740 --> 11:54.820
and I were very close friends. I liked John real 
well. Former dean of business. Hmm? Former dean of

11:58.712 --> 12:06.750
business.

12:06.730 --> 12:07.751
Maybe he didn't have the resources for it. But I 
was... I wasn't too impressed with Chicago. See, I

12:11.140 --> 12:13.850
taught at SMU five years. And they had a college 
division in that college. See, they used to get all

12:15.830 --> 12:21.960
their business instructors from industry and 
mobile supported me to go there. That's all we

12:21.940 --> 12:27.050
taught. But now maybe that's changed. See, I 
haven't been close to that. But I... I still

12:32.027 --> 12:36.250
contend that agriculture and engineering are 
very strong components of that system. All right.

12:37.291 --> 12:38.250
For today, let's stop. And I want to thank you very, 
very much. This has been a very good interview. And

12:42.230 --> 12:44.620
I'll... Whenever I can get a secretary, we're 
going to be hiring soon, get you a double-spaced

12:44.640 --> 12:52.250
first draft to go over and modify as you want to.
