WEBVTT

00:02.326 --> 00:08.074
Fort Allbritton was a new member at that time. All 
right, let's back up to coeducate. Fort

00:11.099 --> 00:15.966
Allbritton was on in 73, because he was the one that 
was in particular. When the proposal about

00:16.326 --> 00:23.336
coeducation, non-compulsory core came up, do you 
have any idea what Mr. Rudder's initial reaction

00:23.396 --> 00:25.880
was? Do you have any idea whether he was for it or 
not? Well, I would say Mr. Rudder probably

00:31.983 --> 00:35.327
wouldn't have expressed his initial reaction. I 
think Mr. Rudder's documentary is going to think

00:36.128 --> 00:40.454
about it, and he's going to contact a few people, 
and he's going to give it out. I don't think he'd

00:40.474 --> 00:45.621
look at it as he's going to have one way or the other. 
I never heard any reports where he disagreed with

00:45.641 --> 00:49.546
it at all. In fact, I have heard on English case, 
he's the one that got people to make the

00:49.847 --> 00:55.394
recommendations to do it. I don't know if that's 
true or not. I've heard that he's asked several

00:56.255 --> 00:59.620
people to get the board to... He

01:00.258 --> 01:13.613
was a

01:00.258 --> 01:13.613
very good decision-making type person. He was the 
type of person that he maybe couldn't run all the

01:13.633 --> 01:23.244
alternatives through his mind at one time, but he 
could run enough through the decision that made

01:13.633 --> 01:23.244
him pretty healthy. Let's see. Let's go back to 
Austin. Which governors were most supportive of

01:26.144 --> 01:36.179
the work of the engineering extension service?

01:37.061 --> 01:54.868
Other

01:37.061 --> 01:54.868
than local legislators, were there any other 
legislators that were key supporters? Yes. Who?

01:55.892 --> 01:57.616
Senator Jones, I have him. All right. Do you 
remember his first name? I don't. Grant. Grant

02:01.464 --> 02:02.365
Jones, that's right. Any others? Over the state? 
Mm-hmm. Well, of course, we had a lot of

02:07.536 --> 02:12.687
representatives, but I can't call their names 
right now. But, yes, what we, you know, what...

02:16.415 --> 02:18.137
I'll tell you how I handled that thing. Whenever we 
had a budget, whenever they had the House

02:18.157 --> 02:30.770
Appropriations Committee, I made the point that 
each one of those people not only know me, but know

02:18.157 --> 02:30.770
my programs.

02:30.790 --> 02:34.894
I didn't work with the Higher Education 
Committee, because I'm not, you know, I went into

02:30.790 --> 02:34.894
Higher Education. But I made sure that everybody 
on the Appropriations Committee knew me. And at

02:38.839 --> 02:43.924
that time, we all used to make presentations 
before they cut that out at the end. They had this

02:44.731 --> 02:59.511
little representative from,

02:44.731 --> 02:59.511
I don't know, right out of Marlin Falls County. He 
got to be a pretty good friend of mine, but that's

02:59.531 --> 03:05.439
been 15, 18 years. I saw his name in the paper. He's a 
lobbyist now, by the way. They all get to be

03:09.625 --> 03:11.207
lobbyists. He was very much supportive of 
Perkins. Then we had a representative out of one of

03:15.022 --> 03:26.877
those Dallas houses, one of Cedar Hill, I don't 
recall. But he was a volunteer farmer, wasn't he?

03:28.499 --> 03:29.180
So he was very supportive of us. But I didn't do it 
very easily. As you look back, what were your

03:31.463 --> 03:42.256
proudest moments with the Extension Service, the 
highlight events that you now remember? Well, I

03:42.276 --> 03:43.898
guess the highlight, the things enjoyed most 
about it was the ability that we had to bring about

03:44.958 --> 03:53.631
new programs to people in the state of Texas. I was 
also extremely proud of the quality of our work. I

03:57.257 --> 04:02.765
never, it was, I didn't get two complaints about 
our work for 19 years I was there. I think we had

04:05.028 --> 04:06.831
extremely good people.

04:10.355 --> 04:23.331
But my really highlights was I figured that when 
you take an organization with 15 employees and you

04:10.355 --> 04:23.331
end up with 400, you own a self-support basis of a 
million and a half, and you get it up to 39 million,

04:10.355 --> 04:23.331
that was always a good feeling. And we carried, 
when I left that thing, you might be able to know,

04:23.351 --> 04:29.059
when I left that organization, I left over 13 
million in reserves. That's great. Okay, now

04:32.864 --> 04:37.349
let's turn to the amusing side. Can you think of 
some... event that happened that was one of those

04:40.730 --> 05:05.640
Texas unbelievable something that maybe you just 
went wrong something just the electricity went

04:40.730 --> 05:05.640
off or there's one of those I know you won't believe 
this but it really happened can you know I have one

04:40.730 --> 05:05.640
okay I always had a state of the union speech we 
always had an annual conference and I always give a

04:40.730 --> 05:05.640
state of the union message which I always stressed 
the basics And, of course, I had an information

05:06.127 --> 05:11.618
person who would always put my presentation 
together for me. And I'd have slides. And the last

05:13.461 --> 05:20.194
thing I always ended up with was a plate. Well, for 
some reason, I had this damn button in my hand

05:20.214 --> 05:25.123
snapping up something. And I was up there just 
talking like mad. little girl in the front row,

05:29.296 --> 05:31.599
they put my thing in. He said, Mr. Bradley, you're 
already on slide 20. I was punching the slide. I

05:37.327 --> 05:41.352
wasn't even close to the one I was talking about. In 
front of all 400 people, you know. So they had a good

05:44.116 --> 05:45.078
laugh. They all had a good laugh. And of course, I 
come back at them and I said, now, Clare, the reason

05:46.680 --> 05:54.190
I did that, I just wanted to see if y'all were paying 
attention. Okay, now from all of your Aggie

05:54.828 --> 06:05.926
memories, either as a student, an employee, give 
me a funny Aggie story and then maybe a sad or

05:54.828 --> 06:05.926
poignant Aggie story. It could involve anything, 
anybody. Well, the saddest one, I can get that

06:10.533 --> 06:13.658
right off my chest in the beginning. My roommate 
was in combat 21 days and killed, and he was from

06:13.919 --> 06:19.047
Grange, Texas. And

06:19.381 --> 06:35.386
you all

06:19.381 --> 06:35.386
were

06:19.381 --> 06:35.386
roommates for how long? Two years. Two years. 
Sure, sure. Okay, now some good Aggie fun. I guess

06:47.377 --> 07:03.872
the biggest Aggie fun we had was when Texas beat us 
in a Thanksgiving game in 1940 and made the

06:47.377 --> 07:03.872
touchdown 7-0 for 30 or 40 seconds of

06:47.377 --> 07:03.872
play. And we were all hitchhiked into Austin 
because that was in 1940. And so my roommate at that

07:08.336 --> 07:15.983
time, also was from Ukraine, and Bo T. Roach, which 
was about five or six of us, But downhearted and

07:16.874 --> 07:21.540
disgusted with life, I guess to say. But anyway, we 
got out on Congress Avenue and started

07:21.560 --> 07:24.043
hitchhiking. We got picked up right off. Two cars, 
one stopped right behind us. One had this Model 8

07:28.849 --> 07:32.154
Ford with the little rumble seat in the back. I 
don't remember. I was in the rumble seat. And they

07:34.196 --> 07:36.059
kept going out to Congress Avenue. We told them we 
didn't want to get on the highway too late. It was a

07:39.463 --> 07:40.384
dream. They took us out about 10 miles out of town, 
and I'll bet you there was 500 University of Texas

07:40.634 --> 07:47.763
people out there and about 50 Aggies. And they 
would beat the hell out of us. With a paddle? No,

07:53.290 --> 07:54.712
with a fish. Oh, oh, battle. Oh.

07:59.378 --> 08:00.299
That was quite funny. The reason that was funny, 
you'd think you're so damn stupid that you'd get in

08:00.500 --> 08:04.785
a car like that. And the other one pertains to your 
Rice University group. Uh-oh, my freshman year,

08:08.277 --> 08:12.764
you know, we used to rent these cattle trailers to 
take us down to the courtroom. And so our

08:13.705 --> 08:26.205
upperclassmen told us that they wanted us to all 
get together, freshmen, there was a whole bunch of

08:13.705 --> 08:26.205
us to get together, freshmen, and have yell 
practice right there at the entrance of the Rice

08:13.705 --> 08:26.205
Gate. Well, of course, four of the five of us, we got 
out there early, and we was, standing there and all

08:34.567 --> 08:42.435
he wants about damn 15 or 20 of these damn rhizomes 
come out and grab us and take us up to the damn

08:34.567 --> 08:42.435
dormitory room and paint a damn heart on our head.

08:47.901 --> 08:50.624
Okay, let's see. If you have any letters, diary, 
journal, or any personal items that you would ever

08:50.825 --> 09:04.219
be willing for the A&M Archives to copy, please do 
so. I'm not asking you to give it to them because you

09:06.608 --> 09:10.512
might want to keep them in the family. But any time 
you have any papers that relate to your career,

09:10.532 --> 09:26.969
particularly as a student and or as an employee, 
and if you have any letters that you wrote home from

09:10.532 --> 09:26.969
overseas, if you would let them. Well, does 
anybody in the family have any? I doubt it. See, my

09:31.001 --> 09:32.403
family's all passed away. Because I thought if 
there was any V-mail or anything like that. I don't

09:37.150 --> 09:43.060
imagine so, because my family's all been doing 
some law, and their kids have everything. But if

09:43.080 --> 09:53.396
you do, because, you see, if we can gather all of 
those materials up, the more we can learn about

09:43.080 --> 09:53.396
this school, the better we can make it go in the 
future. The only thing that I've got... And I will

09:55.043 --> 09:57.386
go through my follow-up. I don't know, but I just 
went through the letters. I got the letters. Every

10:00.090 --> 10:04.456
year, the letter that I got September 1st 
announced what my salary was going to be. I got that

10:04.476 --> 10:06.819
all the way through my career. I'll have to look, 
but I might have some stuff there. Okay, then the

10:10.865 --> 10:11.906
last thing. In your heart now, as you look back, 
what parts of Texas A&M are dearest to you? Well,

10:20.237 --> 10:20.798
the university. No, but what parts of the 
university? I consider the university a part of

10:23.360 --> 10:26.343
Texas A&M. But if I were to come to you and ask... Oh, 
I think engineering. The engineering? Any

10:30.868 --> 10:32.429
particular part of engineering? Well, no, I think 
the... I can't say about the last 10 years. This is

10:38.415 --> 10:41.939
based on the last 10 years. The engineering school 
at Texas A&M University throughout the state of

10:43.240 --> 10:51.088
Texas, and I've traveled it all my life, both in 
industrial economics and in the Texas A&M. They

10:51.946 --> 10:55.231
were known as problem solvers. And people looked 
upon P&M's engineering thing as a place you'd come

10:55.251 --> 11:02.862
forward to get a problem answered, not to get some 
damn theory. And I was always extremely proud. And

11:06.708 --> 11:13.038
I was always proud of the fact that they were all 
very professional with it. I mean, they looked the

11:13.058 --> 11:14.099
part. And I was always proud to say that I was from 
the engineering company. Always. None of them

11:20.589 --> 11:21.210
knew me. But I always felt that they had to be 
respected and stayed down. Of course,

11:26.184 --> 11:33.153
agriculture has a strong, or did at that time have a 
very strong, and you can see why. Because you've

11:33.393 --> 11:35.516
got to eat. And regardless of what you think about 
agriculture, still it was an important segment of

11:35.536 --> 11:40.062
their economy. But you've got to eat. You want an 
unhappy group of people, don't feed them. So

11:43.547 --> 11:48.674
whether you like them or don't like them, you've 
got to respect

11:43.547 --> 11:48.674
them. But I never...

11:53.067 --> 11:55.089
John Pierce and I were very close friends. I liked 
John real well. Former dean of business. Former

11:58.632 --> 12:00.594
dean of business. I always felt that they could 
have. But he was the first dean. Maybe he didn't

12:06.340 --> 12:08.182
have the resources for it. But I was too impressed 
with the college. See, I taught at SMU five years.

12:14.808 --> 12:15.929
And they had a college. They used to get all their 
business school instructors from industry and

12:15.949 --> 12:20.914
mobile supported me to go out there and teach. and 
i've always thought you had a much more

12:21.400 --> 12:41.974
professional but now maybe that's changed all 
right for today let's stop and i want to thank you

12:21.400 --> 12:41.974
very very much this has been a very good interview 
And whenever I can get a secretary, we're going to

12:42.562 --> 12:52.909
be hiring soon, get you a double-spaced first 
draft to go over and modify as you want to.
