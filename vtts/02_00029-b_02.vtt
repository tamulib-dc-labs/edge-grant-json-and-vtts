00:02.326 --> 00:08.074
Fort Albritton was a new member at that time.

00:08.555 --> 00:11.079
All right, let's back up to co-education.

00:11.099 --> 00:13.101
Fort Albritton was on in 73.

00:13.141 --> 00:15.966
Yes.

00:16.326 --> 00:25.880
When the proposal about co-education non-compulsory corps came up, do you have any idea what Mr. Rutter's initial reaction was?

00:26.881 --> 00:28.924
Do you have any idea whether he was for it or...

00:29.900 --> 00:35.327
Well, I would say Mr. Rudder didn't have, probably wouldn't have expressed his initial reaction.

00:35.347 --> 00:38.492
I think Mr. Rudder is going to think about it.

00:38.612 --> 00:40.054
He's going to contact a few people.

00:40.074 --> 00:41.536
I don't think he's negative.

00:41.556 --> 00:45.621
He's going to have one way or the other.

00:45.641 --> 00:49.546
I never heard any remarks where he disagreed with it at all.

00:49.847 --> 00:55.494
In fact, I have heard on English cadence he's the one that got people to make the recommendations to do it.

00:55.514 --> 00:56.235
I don't know if that's true.

00:56.255 --> 00:59.620
I've heard that he's asked several people to get the board to

01:00.258 --> 01:13.613
He was a very good decision-making type of person.

01:13.633 --> 01:23.244
He was the type of person that he maybe couldn't run all the alternatives through his mind at one time, but he could run enough through the decision-making pretty healthy.

01:23.944 --> 01:25.506
Let's see, let's go back to Austin.

01:26.144 --> 01:32.694
Which governors were most supportive of the work of the engineering extension service?

01:32.714 --> 01:34.537
I'd say Dolph Briscoe.

01:34.557 --> 01:35.058
Dolph Briscoe.

01:35.438 --> 01:45.394
The reason I'm saying that, Dolph Corder was certainly capable for assistance in doing different things.

01:45.414 --> 01:48.038
Most governors don't do that.

01:48.058 --> 01:54.868
Other than local legislators, were there any other legislators that were key supporters?

01:54.950 --> 01:55.551
Yes.

01:55.571 --> 01:55.732
Who?

01:55.892 --> 01:57.716
Senator Jones, I'm happy.

01:57.736 --> 01:58.077
All right.

01:58.097 --> 01:59.860
Do you remember his first name?

01:59.880 --> 02:00.201
I don't.

02:00.482 --> 02:01.444
Grant.

02:01.464 --> 02:02.365
Grant Jones, that's right.

02:02.846 --> 02:03.388
Any others?

02:05.953 --> 02:06.474
Over the state?

02:07.376 --> 02:07.516
Mm-hmm.

02:07.536 --> 02:12.687
Well, of course, we had a lot of representatives, but I can't call their names right now.

02:12.707 --> 02:16.114
But yes, what we, you know, wasn't it?

02:16.415 --> 02:18.137
I'll tell you, I'll handle that.

02:18.157 --> 02:30.770
Whenever we had a budget, whenever they had the House Appropriations Committee, I made the point that each one of those people not only know me, but know my programs.

02:30.790 --> 02:33.313
I didn't work with the Higher Education Committee.

02:33.333 --> 02:34.894
You know, with any higher education.

02:34.915 --> 02:38.819
But I made sure that everybody on the Appropriations Committee knew me.

02:38.839 --> 02:43.924
And at that time, we all used to make presentations and cut that out until the end.

02:44.731 --> 02:59.512
They had this little representative from, I don't know, right out of Warland Falls County.

02:59.532 --> 03:05.381
He got to be a pretty good friend of mine, but that's been 15, 18 years ago.

03:05.401 --> 03:06.262
I saw his name in the paper.

03:06.282 --> 03:08.125
He's a lobbyist now, by the way.

03:08.205 --> 03:09.146
Can you remember him reading one of those?

03:09.627 --> 03:10.929
They all get to be lobbyists.

03:10.989 --> 03:12.331
Yeah.

03:12.391 --> 03:14.434
He was very much supportive.

03:15.022 --> 03:23.813
Then we had a representative out of one of those Dallas houses, one of Cedar Hill, I don't think.

03:23.833 --> 03:29.019
But he was a volunteer farmer, so he was very supportive.

03:29.039 --> 03:30.682
But I didn't live a good evening.

03:30.702 --> 03:42.516
What were, as you look back, what were your proudest moments with the Extension Service, the highlight events that you now remember?

03:42.717 --> 03:43.898
Well, I guess the things that I've

03:44.958 --> 03:53.711
enjoyed most about it was the ability that we had to bring about new programs to people in the state of Texas.

03:53.731 --> 03:57.196
I was awfully, extremely proud of the quality of our work.

03:57.257 --> 04:02.765
I never, it was, I didn't get two complaints about our work for 19 years I was there.

04:05.028 --> 04:06.831
I think we had extremely good people.

04:10.355 --> 04:23.331
But my really highlights was, I figured that when you take an organization with 15 employees, you end in the 400, you know, on a self-support basis, a million and a half, and you get it up to 39 million, that was always a good feeling.

04:23.351 --> 04:29.059
And we carried, when I left that thing, you might be nervous to know, when I left that organization, I left over 13 million in reserves.

04:29.780 --> 04:31.822
That's great.

04:32.864 --> 04:37.349
Okay, now, let's turn to the amusing side.

04:38.130 --> 04:39.552
Can you think of some...

04:40.730 --> 05:05.640
event that happened that was one of those Texas unbelievable something that maybe just went wrong something just the electricity went off or it's one of those I know you won't believe this but it really happened can you I'll have one okay I always had a state of the union speech we always had an annual conference and I always give a state of the union message which I always stressed the basics

05:06.127 --> 05:11.618
And, of course, I had an information person who would always put my presentation together for me.

05:11.698 --> 05:13.441
And I'd have slides.

05:13.461 --> 05:20.194
And the last thing I always ended up with was the play.

05:20.214 --> 05:25.123
Well, for some reason, I had this damn button in my hand, snapping up something.

05:25.143 --> 05:28.590
And I was up there just talking like mad at home.

05:29.296 --> 05:31.759
little girl with the front row, he put me thinking.

05:31.819 --> 05:34.022
He said, Mr. Bradley, you're already on slide 20.

05:34.303 --> 05:36.906
I was punching the slide.

05:37.327 --> 05:43.756
I wasn't even close to the one that I was talking about in front of all 400 people, you know.

05:44.116 --> 05:45.078
So they had a good laugh.

05:45.158 --> 05:46.660
They all had a good laugh.

05:46.680 --> 05:54.190
And of course, I come back at them and I said, now, Clara, the reason I did that, I just wanted to see if you all were paying attention.

05:54.828 --> 06:05.926
Okay, now, from all of your Aggie memories, either as a student or employee, give me a funny Aggie story, and then maybe a sad or poignant Aggie story.

06:06.907 --> 06:09.111
It could involve anything, anybody.

06:10.533 --> 06:13.658
Well, the saddest one, I can get that right off my chest in the beginning.

06:13.919 --> 06:19.047
My roommate was in combat 21 days and killed, and he was from New Orleans, Texas.

06:19.381 --> 06:20.863
Where?

06:21.785 --> 06:35.386
And you all were roommates for how long?

06:35.886 --> 06:38.791
Two years.

06:38.851 --> 06:42.096
Sure, sure.

06:42.457 --> 06:46.603
Okay, now some good Aggie fun.

06:47.377 --> 06:52.842
Well, I guess the biggest Aggie fund we had was in Texas, Peterson.

06:52.862 --> 06:58.547
The Thanksgiving game in 1940 made the touchdown seven to nothing.

06:58.567 --> 07:03.872
First 30, 40 seconds of play.

07:03.892 --> 07:07.776
And we were all hitchhiked into Austin.

07:07.796 --> 07:13.581
And so my roommate at that time also was from Craig.

07:13.601 --> 07:15.983
And Bo T. Rove, which is about five or six of us,

07:16.874 --> 07:17.935
But downhearted.

07:19.077 --> 07:21.540
Disgusting his life, I guess to say.

07:21.560 --> 07:24.043
But anyway, we got out on Congress Avenue to start hitchhiking.

07:24.103 --> 07:24.704
We got picked up.

07:25.445 --> 07:25.886
Right off.

07:26.586 --> 07:27.087
Two cars.

07:27.227 --> 07:28.829
One thought, another thought right behind us.

07:28.849 --> 07:32.154
One had this Model 8 Ford with a little rumble seat in the back.

07:32.214 --> 07:32.814
I don't remember.

07:32.834 --> 07:34.176
I was in the rumble seat.

07:34.196 --> 07:35.938
And they kept going out to Congress Avenue.

07:35.958 --> 07:39.463
You know, we told them we wouldn't want to get on the highway tonight.

07:39.483 --> 07:40.384
It looked great.

07:40.634 --> 07:47.763
And they took us out about 10 miles out there, and I'll bet you there was 500 universities in Texas people out there and about 50 Aggies.

07:49.105 --> 07:52.349
And they would eat the hell out of us.

07:52.369 --> 07:53.270
With a paddle?

07:53.290 --> 07:54.712
No, with a fish.

07:54.732 --> 07:56.354
Oh, oh, battle.

07:56.374 --> 07:56.595
Oh.

07:59.378 --> 08:00.299
That was quite funny.

08:00.500 --> 08:04.785
The reason that was funny, you'd think you're so damn stupid that you'd get in a car like that.

08:05.272 --> 08:07.736
And the other one pertains to your Rice University group.

08:08.277 --> 08:12.764
Uh-oh, my freshman year, you know, we used to rent these cattle trailers to take us down to the courtroom.

08:13.705 --> 08:21.578
And so our upperclassmen told us that they wanted us to all get together freshmen.

08:21.598 --> 08:26.205
There was a whole bunch of us to get together freshmen and have yelp practice right there to the entrance of the Rice Gate.

08:27.988 --> 08:33.777
Well, of course, four of the five of us, we got out there early, and we was,

08:34.567 --> 08:42.435
standing there, and all he wants, about 15 or 20 of these damn rice aisles come out and grab us, take us up to the damn dormitory room, paint a damn horror on our head.

08:47.901 --> 08:50.624
Okay, let's see.

08:50.825 --> 09:04.219
If you have any letters, diary, journal, or any personal items that you would ever be willing for the A&M archives to copy,

09:05.127 --> 09:06.068
Please do so.

09:06.628 --> 09:10.512
Not asking you to give it to them because you might want to keep them in the family.

09:10.532 --> 09:26.048
But any time you have any papers that relate to your career, particularly as a student and or as an employee, and if you have any letters that you wrote home from overseas.

09:26.248 --> 09:30.392
Well, does anybody in the family have any?

09:30.440 --> 09:30.981
I doubt it.

09:31.001 --> 09:32.403
See, my family's all passed away.

09:32.443 --> 09:34.967
Because I thought if there was any V-mail or anything like that.

09:37.150 --> 09:42.519
I don't imagine so because my family's all been doing so long and their kids have it for me.

09:43.080 --> 09:53.396
But if you do, because, you see, if we can gather all of those materials up, the more we learn about this school, the better we can make it go in the future.

09:53.796 --> 09:54.878
The only thing that I've got...

09:55.043 --> 09:56.906
that I will go through my file.

09:57.406 --> 09:59.349
I don't know, but I just went through the letter.

09:59.369 --> 10:00.050
I got the letters.

10:00.090 --> 10:04.456
Every year, the letter that I got September 1st, now it's what my salary is going to be.

10:04.476 --> 10:06.819
I got that all the way through my career.

10:07.280 --> 10:10.144
I'll have to look, but I might have some stuff there.

10:10.865 --> 10:11.906
Okay, then the last thing.

10:12.387 --> 10:19.917
In your heart now, as you look back, what parts of Texas A&M are dearest to you?

10:20.217 --> 10:20.798
Oh, university.

10:21.318 --> 10:23.300
No, but what parts of the university?

10:23.360 --> 10:25.322
I consider the university a part, but that's not it.

10:26.363 --> 10:29.326
But if I were to come to you and ask... Oh, I think engineering.

10:29.346 --> 10:29.967
The engineering?

10:30.868 --> 10:32.429
Any particular part of engineering?

10:33.370 --> 10:41.939
Well, no, I think the... I can't say about the last 10 years, because this is based on the last 10 years.

10:43.240 --> 10:51.088
The engineering school at Texas A&M University throughout the state of Texas, and I've traveled it all my life, both in industrial economics and in Texas

10:51.946 --> 10:55.231
They were known as problem solvers.

10:55.251 --> 11:02.862
And people looked upon P&M's engineering thing as a place you'd come forward to get a problem answered, not to get so damn theory.

11:04.204 --> 11:06.688
And I was always extremely proud.

11:06.708 --> 11:13.038
And I was always proud of the fact that they were all very professional with it.

11:13.058 --> 11:14.099
I mean, they looked hard.

11:16.563 --> 11:20.128
And I was always proud to say that I was from the engineering company.

11:20.148 --> 11:20.289
Always.

11:20.309 --> 11:21.210
And I don't know the engineering company.

11:21.798 --> 11:24.962
But I always felt that they had to be respected in the state.

11:24.982 --> 11:30.329
Now, of course, agriculture has a strong, or it did at that time, have a very strong.

11:32.212 --> 11:33.153
And you can see why.

11:33.393 --> 11:35.516
Because you've got to eat.

11:35.536 --> 11:40.022
And regardless of what you think about agriculture, it's still an important segment of their economy.

11:40.042 --> 11:41.024
Because you've got to eat.

11:41.044 --> 11:43.527
You want an unhappy group of people who don't feed them.

11:43.547 --> 11:48.674
So whether you like them or don't like them, you've got to respect them.

11:48.694 --> 11:51.197
But I never...

11:53.067 --> 11:55.089
John Pierce and I were very close friends.

11:55.109 --> 11:57.111
I liked John real well.

11:57.131 --> 11:58.452
Former dean of business.

11:58.472 --> 11:58.612
Mm-hmm.

11:58.632 --> 12:00.794
Former dean of business.

12:00.815 --> 12:02.897
Mm-hmm.

12:02.917 --> 12:06.320
I always felt that they could have, because he was the first dean.

12:06.340 --> 12:07.841
Maybe he didn't have the resources.

12:07.861 --> 12:11.405
But I was, I wanted to impress him at the college.

12:11.465 --> 12:15.809
See, I was talking to SMU five years at night, and they had a, I've been at that college.

12:15.829 --> 12:20.914
See, they used to get all their business instructors from industry and global to support me to go out there and teach them.

12:21.400 --> 12:40.512
All right, for today let's stop, and I want to thank you very, very much.

12:40.592 --> 12:41.974
This has been a very good interview.

12:42.562 --> 12:52.909
And whenever I can get a secretary, we're going to be hiring soon, get you a double-spaced first draft to go over and modify as you want to.
