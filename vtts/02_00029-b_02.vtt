WEBVTT

00:02.360 --> 00:08.108
Fort Allbritton was a new member at that time. All 
right, let's back up to coeducation. Fort

00:11.112 --> 00:16.338
Allbritton was on in 73, because he was . When the 
proposal about coeducation, non-compulsory

00:16.358 --> 00:23.348
core came up, do you have any idea what Mr. Rudder's 
initial reaction was? Do you have any idea whether

00:26.892 --> 00:28.975
he was for it or not? Well, I would say Mr. Rudder 
probably wouldn't have expressed his initial

00:32.016 --> 00:35.401
reaction. I think Mr. Rudder is going to think 
about it. He's going to contact the QP. I don't

00:39.868 --> 00:45.656
think he'd make a decision like that one way or the 
other. I never heard any reports where he

00:45.676 --> 00:49.582
disagreed with it at all. I have heard on English 
case he's the one that got people to make the

00:49.883 --> 00:54.730
recommendations to do it. I don't know if that's 
true or not. I've heard that he's asked several

00:56.032 --> 00:59.637
people to get the board But

01:00.292 --> 01:13.634
he

01:00.292 --> 01:13.634
was a very good decision-making type of person. He 
was the type of person that he maybe couldn't run

01:13.694 --> 01:23.430
all the alternatives through his mind at one time, 
but he could run enough through the decision that

01:13.694 --> 01:23.430
made him pretty healthy. Let's see, let's go back 
to Austin. Which governors were most supportive

01:26.224 --> 01:32.736
of the work of the Engineering Extension Service? 
I'd say Dolph Briscoe. Dolph Briscoe. The reason

01:35.482 --> 01:45.340
I'm saying that, Dolph Cornell was several 
occasions for assistance

01:35.482 --> 01:45.340
in doing those things. And most governors don't do 
that. Other than local legislators, were there

01:47.947 --> 01:54.774
any other legislators that were key supporters? 
Yes. Who? Senator Jones, on that one. All right. Do

01:58.537 --> 01:59.498
you remember his first name? I don't. Grant. Grant 
Jones, that's right. Any others? Over the state?

02:06.845 --> 02:07.546
Mm-hmm. Well, of course, we had a lot of 
representatives, but I can't call their names

02:07.566 --> 02:14.352
right now. But, yes, we, you know, wasn't. I'll 
tell you how I handled that thing. Whenever we had a

02:18.211 --> 02:30.811
budget, whenever they had the House 
Appropriations Committee, I made the point that

02:18.211 --> 02:30.811
each one of those people, not only know me, but know 
my programs. I didn't work with the Higher

02:30.831 --> 02:37.822
Education Committee, but I made sure that 
everybody on the Appropriations Committee knew

02:30.831 --> 02:37.822
me. And at that time, we all used to make 
presentations before they cut that out at the end.

02:44.697 --> 02:59.538
They had this little representative from, I don't

02:44.697 --> 02:59.538
know, right out of Marlin Falls County, whatever 
it is. He got to be a pretty good friend of mine, but

02:59.558 --> 03:05.287
that was 15, 18 years ago. I sort of saw his name in 
the paper. He's a lobbyist now, by the way. Mm-hmm,

03:08.031 --> 03:08.331
mm-hmm. Have you read any of one of those? They all 
get to be lobbyists. Yeah. He was very much

03:12.397 --> 03:14.620
supportive of Trump. Then we had a representative 
out of one of those Dallas towns, one of Cedar Hill,

03:15.038 --> 03:25.573
I don't know. But he was a volunteer for us, so he was 
very supportive of us. But I didn't do it really.

03:30.740 --> 03:42.416
What were, as you look back, what were your 
proudest moments with the Extension Service, the

03:30.740 --> 03:42.416
highlight events that you now remember? Well, I 
guess the highlight, the things that I remember,

03:44.975 --> 03:53.610
enjoyed most about it was the ability that we had to 
bring about new programs to people in the state of

03:44.975 --> 03:53.610
Texas. I was also extremely proud of the quality of 
our work. I didn't get two complaints about our

03:57.276 --> 04:05.029
work over 19 years I was there. I think we had 
extremely good people.

04:10.372 --> 04:23.344
But my really highlights was I figured that when 
you take an organization with 15 employees and you

04:10.372 --> 04:23.344
end with 400 and you own a self-support base of a 
million and a half and you get it up to 39 million,

04:10.372 --> 04:23.344
that was always a good feeling. And we carried, 
when I left that thing, you might be able to know,

04:23.364 --> 04:29.789
when I left that organization, I left over 13 
million in reserves. That's great. Okay, now

04:32.872 --> 04:37.336
let's turn to the amusing side. Can you think of 
some... event that happened that was one of those

04:40.763 --> 04:54.585
Texas, unbelievable, something that maybe just 
went wrong, something just, the electricity went

04:40.763 --> 04:54.585
off, or it was one of those, I know you won't believe 
this, but it really happened? Can you? Well, I have

04:55.867 --> 04:56.848
one. Okay. I always had a State of the Union speech. 
We always had an annual conference, and I always

04:59.232 --> 05:05.522
gave a State of the Union message, which I always 
stressed the basics. And, of course, I had an

05:06.160 --> 05:11.707
information person who would always put my 
presentation together for me. And I'd have

05:11.727 --> 05:13.450
slides. And the last thing I always ended up with 
was a plate. Well, for some reason, I had the damn

05:20.219 --> 05:25.125
button in my hand snapping up something. And I was 
up there just talking like mad. He said, Mr.

05:29.330 --> 05:36.518
Bradley, you're already on slide 20. I wasn't even 
close to the one I was talking about. In front of all

05:41.925 --> 05:43.767
400 people, you know. So they had a good laugh. They 
all had a good laugh. And of course, I come back at

05:46.690 --> 05:54.139
them, and I said, now, Clara, the reason I did that, 
I just wanted to see if you all were paying

05:46.690 --> 05:54.139
attention. OK, now, from all of your Aggie 
memories, either as a student or employee, give me

05:54.862 --> 06:05.932
a funny Aggie story and then maybe a sad or poignant 
Aggie story. It could involve anything, anybody.

06:10.536 --> 06:13.658
Well, the saddest one, I can get that right off my 
chest in the beginning. My roommate was in combat

06:13.819 --> 06:17.482
21 days and killed. And he was from Grange, Texas.

06:21.826 --> 06:24.548
And I was in Fort Hood at the time, and I got called 
over. Where?

06:29.701 --> 06:35.411
And

06:29.701 --> 06:35.411
you all were roommates for how long? Two years. Two 
years. Sure, sure.

06:44.966 --> 06:46.568
Okay, now some good Aggie fun. Well, I guess the 
biggest Aggie fun we had was in Texas, The

06:52.793 --> 06:58.762
Thanksgiving game in 1940, we made the touchdown 
7-0. First 30, 40 seconds of play,

06:59.223 --> 07:07.776
and we were all hitchhiked into Austin. And so my 
roommate at that time, also was from Ukraine, and

07:07.796 --> 07:14.205
O.T. Rose, which was about five or six of us, was 
downhearted. I had disgusted his life, I must say,

07:18.815 --> 07:21.679
with bitching him over. But anyway, we got out on 
Congress Avenue and started hitchhiking. We got

07:23.942 --> 07:25.885
picked up right off. Two cars, one stopped, 
another stopped right behind us. One had this

07:28.889 --> 07:32.234
Model A Ford with the little rumble seat in the 
back. I don't remember. I was in the rumble seat in

07:32.895 --> 07:34.197
the back. And they kept going out to Congress 
Avenue. You know, we told them, we want to get on the

07:35.960 --> 07:39.725
highway tonight. And they took us out about 10 
miles out of town. And I'll tell you, there was 500

07:43.330 --> 07:48.197
University of Texas people out there and about 50 
Aggies. And they would eat the hell out of us. With a

07:52.375 --> 07:52.975
paddle? No, with a fish. Oh, oh, battle. Oh.

07:59.404 --> 08:00.325
That was quite funny. The reason that was funny, 
you'd think you're so damn stupid that you'd get in

08:00.505 --> 08:05.352
a car like that. And the other one pertains to your 
Rice University group. Uh-oh, my freshman year,

08:08.316 --> 08:13.723
you know, we used to rent these cattle trailers to 
take us down to the courtroom. And so our

08:13.743 --> 08:17.728
upperclassmen told us that they wanted us to to all 
get together, freshmen. There was a whole bunch of

08:21.608 --> 08:26.214
us to get together, freshmen, and have yell 
practice right there at the entrance of the rice

08:21.608 --> 08:26.214
gate. Well, four of the five of us, we got out there 
early. And we was standing there. And all at once,

08:35.185 --> 08:46.399
about 15 or 20 of these damn rice owls come out and 
grab us, take us up to the damn dormitory room, and

08:35.185 --> 08:46.399
paint a damn horror on our head.

08:47.797 --> 08:50.640
OK, let's see. If you have any letters, diary, 
journal, or any personal items that you would ever

08:50.840 --> 09:06.115
be willing for the A&M Archives to copy, please do 
so. Not asking you to give it to them, because you

09:06.675 --> 09:10.039
might want to keep them in the family. But any time 
you have any papers that relate to your career,

09:10.579 --> 09:17.466
particularly as a student, And or as an employee. 
And if you have any letters that you wrote home from

09:20.864 --> 09:24.588
overseas. If you would let me know. Well, does 
anybody in the family have any? I doubt it. See, my

09:31.156 --> 09:32.458
family's all passed away. Because I thought if 
there was any V-mail or anything like that. I don't

09:35.061 --> 09:42.610
imagine so because my family's all been gone so 
long and their kids have everything. But if you do,

09:43.062 --> 09:53.392
because, you see, if we can gather all of those 
materials up, the more we can learn about this

09:43.062 --> 09:53.392
school, the better we can make it go in the future. 
The only thing that I've got that I don't know, I

09:53.712 --> 09:56.935
will go through my file. I don't know, but I just 
went through the letters. I've got the letters.

10:00.279 --> 10:03.482
Every year, the letter that I got September 1st, 
now it's a little sour. Yeah, yeah, yeah. I've got

10:04.483 --> 10:06.805
that all the way through my career. I'll have to 
look, but I might have some stuff there. Okay, then

10:10.754 --> 10:11.916
the last thing. In your heart now, as you look back, 
what parts of Texas A&M are dearest to you? No, but

10:21.412 --> 10:24.757
what parts of the university?

10:26.400 --> 10:32.510
But if I were to come to you and ask the engineering, 
any particular part of engineering? Well, no, I

10:33.431 --> 10:35.715
think the... I can't say about the last 10 years, 
but this is based on the last 10 years. The

10:43.256 --> 10:51.985
engineering school at Texas A&M University, 
throughout the state of Texas, and I've traveled

10:43.256 --> 10:51.985
it all my life, both in industrial economics and . 
They were known as problem solvers. And people

10:55.229 --> 11:02.877
looked upon A&M's engineering thing as a place 
you'd come far to get a proper answer, not to get

10:55.229 --> 11:02.877
some damn theory. And I was always extremely 
proud. And I was always proud of the fact that they

11:06.492 --> 11:13.042
were all very professional. I mean, they looked 
the part. And I was always proud to say that I was

11:16.567 --> 11:20.613
from the Indian Country. Always. None of them knew 
me. But I always felt that they had to respect the

11:21.895 --> 11:25.080
state. Now, of course, agriculture has a strong, 
or it did at that time, have a very strong. And you

11:32.251 --> 11:33.432
can see why. Because you've got to eat. And 
regardless what you think about agriculture,

11:35.433 --> 11:39.881
it's still an important segment of their economy. 
But you've got to eat. If you want an unhappy group

11:40.762 --> 11:43.527
of people, don't feed them. So whether you like 
them or don't like them, you've got to respect

11:43.547 --> 11:48.676
them. But I never,

11:48.696 --> 11:55.147
John Pierce and I were very close friends. I like 
John real well. Former dean of business. Former

11:58.693 --> 12:00.917
dean of business.

12:02.551 --> 12:06.315
I always felt that they could have, but Colt, he was 
the first dean. Maybe he didn't have the

12:06.335 --> 12:11.421
resources, but I was, I wasn't too impressed with 
the college. See, I taught at SMU five years. And

12:13.663 --> 12:15.806
they had a, I was in the ninth college. See, they 
used to get all their business school instructors

12:15.826 --> 12:21.552
from the Ministry of Mobile supported me to go out 
there and teach. And I always thought that SMU had a

12:21.572 --> 12:26.758
much more effective school of business. But now 
maybe that's changed. See, I haven't been close to

12:27.919 --> 12:29.301
that. All

12:30.226 --> 12:38.717
right, for today, let's stop. And I want to thank 
you very, very much. This has been a very good

12:40.579 --> 12:41.921
interview. And whenever I can get a secretary, 
we're going to be hiring soon, get you a

12:42.942 --> 12:52.875
double-spaced first draft to go over and modify as 
you want to.
