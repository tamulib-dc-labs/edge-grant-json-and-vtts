00:01.930 --> 00:08.100
Fort

00:01.930 --> 00:08.100
Allbritton was a new member at that time. All 
right, let's back up to coeducation. Fort

00:10.880 --> 00:14.080
Allbritton was on in 73 because he was the one who 
was in particular. When the proposal about

00:15.340 --> 00:20.460
coeducation, non-compulsory core came up, do you 
have any idea what Mr. Rutter's initial reaction

00:20.700 --> 00:25.920
was? Do you have any idea whether he was for it or 
when it first came up? I would say Mr. Rutter

00:31.190 --> 00:35.150
probably wouldn't have expressed his initial 
reaction.

00:45.500 --> 00:49.570
I never heard any remark with it at all.

01:05.330 --> 01:13.330
But he

01:05.330 --> 01:13.330
was a very good decision-making type of person. He 
was the type of person that he maybe couldn't run

01:13.310 --> 01:18.990
all the alternatives to his mind at one time, but he 
could run enough through the decision and maybe it

01:19.010 --> 01:21.330
was pretty healthy. Let's see, let's go back to 
Austin. Which governors were most supportive of

01:26.180 --> 01:30.800
the work of the engineering Extension Service. 
I'd say Dolph Briscoe. The reason I'm saying that,

01:34.440 --> 01:37.600
Dolph Conner.

01:47.730 --> 01:54.650
Other than local legislators, were there any 
other legislators that were key supporters? Yes.

01:55.606 --> 01:55.691
Who? Senator. All right. Do you remember his first 
name? I don't. Grant. Grant Jones, that's right.

02:02.710 --> 02:03.391
Any others? Over the state? Mm-hmm. I can't call 
their names right now.

02:16.460 --> 02:17.821
I'll tell you, I have that thing. Whenever we had a 
budget, whenever they had to let, it was the House

02:20.260 --> 02:22.260
Appropriations Committee. I made it important 
that each one of them not only know me, but know my

02:23.060 --> 02:27.840
program. I didn't work with the higher education 
committees. I brought in all the new higher

02:32.760 --> 02:34.181
education. But I made sure that everybody on the 
Appropriations Committee knew me. And at that

02:38.680 --> 02:42.000
time, we all used to make presentations before 
they cut that out. They

02:42.440 --> 02:58.470
had this little representative from down

02:42.440 --> 02:58.470
in New Orleans, Falls County, whatever it is. He 
got to be a pretty good friend of mine, but that's

02:59.210 --> 03:01.550
good.

03:04.830 --> 03:05.811
I saw his name. The paper's a lobbyist now, by the 
way. Mm-hmm. Do you remember reading one of those?

03:09.450 --> 03:10.891
They all get to be lobbyists. Yeah. He was very much 
supportive, I think. Then we had a representative

03:14.990 --> 03:22.220
out of one of those Dallas towns, one of Cedar Hill, 
I don't know. But he was a volunteer for us, so he was

03:23.060 --> 03:27.830
very supportive. But I didn't know him very well. 
As you look back, what were your proudest moments

03:30.210 --> 03:38.720
with the Extension Service? The highlight events 
that you now remember. Well, I guess the

03:42.280 --> 04:02.720
highlight, the things that I enjoyed most about it 
was the ability that we had complaints

03:42.280 --> 04:02.720
about our work over 19 years I was there.

04:10.370 --> 04:15.950
But my really highlights was I figured that when 
you take an organization with 15 employees and you

04:10.370 --> 04:15.950
end up with 400, you own a self-support base of a 
million and a half, and you get it up to 39 million,

04:20.620 --> 04:29.010
and we carried, when I left that thing in the 
organization, we left over 13 million in

04:20.620 --> 04:29.010
reserves. Mm, that's great. Uh, okay. Now, let's 
turn to the amusing side. Can you think of some

04:38.080 --> 04:44.970
event that happened that was one of those Texas, 
unbelievable, something that maybe just went

04:45.210 --> 04:52.120
wrong, something just, the electricity went off, 
or it was one of those, I know you won't believe

04:52.180 --> 04:54.520
this, but it really happened? Can you? Well, I have 
one. Okay. I always had a State of the Union speech.

04:59.060 --> 05:02.960
We always had an annual conference, and I always 
gave a State of the Union message, and I always

05:03.620 --> 05:35.470
stressed the basics, and, of course, I

05:03.620 --> 05:35.470
had to,

05:03.620 --> 05:35.470
for some reason, I had to.

05:35.450 --> 05:43.750
I wasn't even close to the one I was talking about in 
front of all 400 people, you know. So they had a good

05:44.010 --> 05:45.031
laugh. They all had a good laugh, and, of course, I 
come back at them, and I said, now, Clara, the

05:48.610 --> 05:54.770
reason I did that, I just want to see it.

05:54.750 --> 06:02.690
Okay, now, from all of your Aggie memories, either 
as a student, an employee, give me a funny Aggie

05:54.750 --> 06:02.690
story, and then maybe a sad. A sad or poignant Aggie 
story. It could involve anything, anybody. Well,

06:10.450 --> 06:12.530
the saddest one, I can get that right off my chest. 
My roommate was in

06:13.510 --> 06:33.660
college.

06:33.900 --> 06:35.401
And you all were roommates for how long? Two years. 
Two years. But we was in the same outfit.

06:44.710 --> 06:46.530
Okay, now some good Aggie fun. This is the biggest 
Aggie fun. Thanksgiving

06:49.460 --> 07:00.730
game in 1940, we made a touchdown, 7-0, 30-40 
seconds of play. All

07:01.250 --> 07:05.480
hitchhiked into Austin. And my roommate at that 
time also was from O.T. Rose. Which was about five

07:14.450 --> 07:15.971
or six of us. But downhearted.

07:20.800 --> 07:23.880
But anyway, we got out on Congress Avenue and 
started hitchhiking. We got picked up. Right off.

07:26.630 --> 07:27.080
Two cars. One stopped, another stopped right 
behind us. One had this Model 8 Ford with the little

07:28.780 --> 07:31.300
rumble seat in the back. I don't remember. I was in 
the rumble seat. And they kept going out to

07:33.860 --> 07:35.840
Congress Avenue. You know, we told them, we don't 
want to get on the highway too late. We're free. And

07:41.134 --> 07:41.560
they took us out. I didn't know what was happening. 
And I'll tell you, there was five other University

07:43.080 --> 07:46.300
of Texas people out there, and about 50 Aggies. And 
they would beat the hell out of us. With a paddle?

07:53.190 --> 07:54.311
No, with a fist. Oh, oh. With a paddle. Oh. And that 
was quite funny. The reason that was funny, you'd

08:00.750 --> 08:04.770
think you're so damn stupid that you'd get in a car 
like that. And the other one pertains to your Rice

08:05.230 --> 08:07.750
University group. Uh-oh. My freshman year, you 
know, we used to rent these cattle trailers to take

08:08.655 --> 08:12.670
us down to the court room. And so our upperclassmen 
told us that they wanted us to. To all get together,

08:18.150 --> 08:21.490
freshmen. There was a whole bunch of us to get 
together for freshmen. And have yelp practice

08:23.830 --> 08:26.170
right there at the entrance of the rice gate. Well, 
four of the five of us, we got out there early. And we

08:33.140 --> 08:35.120
was standing there. And all at once, about 15 or 20 
of these damn rice owls come out and grab us. Take us

08:39.540 --> 08:42.420
up to the damn dormitory room and paint a damn heart 
on our head. Ha, ha, ha, ha.

08:47.590 --> 08:48.337
Okay. Uh. Let's see. If you have any letters, 
diary, journal, or any personal items that you

08:59.180 --> 09:03.980
would ever be willing for the A&M Archives to copy, 
please do so. Not asking you to give it to them,

09:06.310 --> 09:09.930
because you might want to keep them in the family. 
But anytime you have any papers that relate to your

09:09.910 --> 09:15.810
career, particularly as a student and or as an 
employee, and if you have any letters that you

09:20.390 --> 09:24.450
wrote home from overseas, if you would let... I 
don't have any of those. Well, does anybody in the

09:28.120 --> 09:30.380
family have any? I doubt it. See, my family's all 
family. Because I thought if there was any V-mail

09:32.410 --> 09:34.990
or anything like that. I don't know.

09:42.910 --> 09:49.210
But if you do, because, you see, if we can gather all 
of those materials up, the more we can learn about

09:49.190 --> 09:53.350
this school, the better we can make it go in the 
future. The only thing that I've got, and I don't

09:53.630 --> 10:03.410
know, I don't go through my salary. Yeah, yeah, 
yeah. I got that one.

10:10.680 --> 10:11.901
Okay, then the last thing. In your heart now, as you 
look back, what parts of Texas A&M dearest to you?

10:20.090 --> 10:20.777
No. No, but what parts of the university? But

10:23.400 --> 10:28.220
if I were to come to you and ask... Oh, I think 
engineering. The engineering? Any particular

10:30.923 --> 10:32.280
part of engineering? No, I think the perspective

10:33.890 --> 11:25.220
of state

10:33.890 --> 11:25.220
government.

11:26.140 --> 11:30.290
Of course, agriculture has a strong, or did at that 
time have a very strong, and you can see why. You

11:33.450 --> 11:42.360
want an unhappy group of people, don't you? So, 
whether you like them or don't like them, you've

11:42.520 --> 11:46.020
got to respect them. Pierce

11:46.340 --> 11:54.900
and I were very close friends. I like John real 
well. Former dean of business. Hmm? Former dean of

11:58.663 --> 11:59.531
business. Maybe

11:59.870 --> 12:07.810
he didn't have the resources for it. I was, I wasn't 
too impressed with Chicago. See, I thought of this

12:10.720 --> 12:12.301
in U5 years. And they had a, I was in the United 
College. See, they used to get all their business

12:15.790 --> 12:19.110
and instructional ministry and mobile support 
and we needed to go there. I always thought, but now

12:22.120 --> 12:27.770
maybe that's changed. See, I haven't been close to 
Chicago. But I, I still contend that agriculture

12:30.260 --> 12:32.940
and engineering, you know, there is. All right, 
for today, let's stop. And I want to thank you very,

12:38.890 --> 12:40.511
very much. This has been a very good interview. And 
I'll, whenever I can get a secretary, we're going

12:42.730 --> 12:47.010
to be hiring soon, get you a double-spaced first 
draft to go over and modify as you want to.
