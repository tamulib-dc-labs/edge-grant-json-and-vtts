00:02.782 --> 00:15.786
July and August and early September, it makes you 
begin to think about a college education that's

00:02.782 --> 00:15.786
going to be a better route. I was not adverse to hard 
work later on. I deeply appreciated it because I

00:17.930 --> 00:25.144
knew how to work hard in the classroom and later in 
career. Describe, I have not had such a

00:25.934 --> 00:34.645
conversation with anyone about med school 
before. Describe how you and the other members of

00:34.665 --> 00:44.757
that entering class, how you were gathered, how 
did the year begin, how did y'all get into classes

00:34.665 --> 00:44.757
and so forth. Well it was interesting because at 
this same time A&M was undergoing the transition

00:44.777 --> 00:54.169
from non-compulsory or two non-compulsory 
corps, and the admission of women. And the very

01:01.431 --> 01:09.022
first young woman to ever go through veterinary 
college was in my class. There were 63 young men and

01:09.563 --> 01:12.787
one young lady. And we did have orientation for it. 
We had a full day orientation prior to the start of

01:16.713 --> 01:20.899
classes. And of course, when you're here on campus 
and you're talking to all the veterinary

01:21.554 --> 01:27.847
students, you know a whole lot. The word of mouth on 
campus is probably the best communication link

01:27.867 --> 01:32.618
there is. So we knew what to expect. We knew how hard 
it was going to be. We knew what the long hours would

01:36.145 --> 01:37.909
be. And we also just assembled as a group. And with 
only 64 people, you get to know each other very

01:44.903 --> 01:48.226
quickly. And I had had classes with so many of the 
others in my first class. You also had friends that

01:55.512 --> 01:59.676
you left behind that didn't get in. They didn't 
have the grades to get in. Many of them were going to

02:01.097 --> 02:04.360
go another year and to keep trying to get in. And we 
knew what we were in for to some degree. But we were

02:13.276 --> 02:15.599
also in another transition. We were in the 
transition to the three year, year round, nine

02:16.560 --> 02:32.797
trimesters of work, which is actually one more 
comparable to semester credit hours than the four

02:16.560 --> 02:32.797
years at two. And we knew we were in for long hours 
the entire year. We only got a small time off of

02:37.883 --> 02:41.967
about two weeks in August, so it was grueling. We 
had 39 contact hours in class my first semester,

02:47.372 --> 02:57.726
and on Fridays we had nine hours of class. We 
started every Friday morning for 15 weeks with a

02:58.447 --> 03:07.279
retroactive exam in microbiology. and anatomy 
lab from 1 to 5 on Friday afternoons. And one Friday

03:12.902 --> 03:20.311
afternoon, about three quarters through the 
semester, one of our classmates threw up his arms.

03:20.872 --> 03:21.673
He said, that's it. I can't take anymore. I'm gone. 
And we never saw him again. Oh, really? Back to that

03:26.739 --> 03:27.960
orientation. I've heard that Al Price used to give 
an impressive... Oh, clearly he was an impressive

03:28.141 --> 03:37.232
individual. And I will tell you, I had always had an 
interest since a small boy of being a scientist, of

03:37.550 --> 03:51.646
being in science, of accomplishing something 
that would be known, of achieving some things big.

03:52.947 --> 04:04.760
And when Al Price gave the orientation and often 
would come speak to us as a class, I thought, I want

03:52.947 --> 04:04.760
to be a dean. I want to be in a leadership role in 
veterinary medicine. I'm not sure at that point I

04:10.346 --> 04:16.916
had the vision of then going higher up in upper 
administration. I later got that vision. But he

04:20.201 --> 04:32.160
was so professional and made such an impact, I 
believe, on all 64 of us about the trust that had

04:20.201 --> 04:32.160
been given to us. about the select few out of the 
600, here we were the 64, that we had a real

04:32.562 --> 04:48.076
obligation and responsibility to not only 
ourselves and our parents, but to this

04:32.562 --> 04:48.076
institution. And you could not help but want to 
achieve because of how he laid things out and just

04:49.397 --> 05:01.067
the overall role model professionalism that was 
before us. Now, I've heard that he gave an emphasis

05:01.165 --> 05:06.932
on pronouncing the name of the profession 
correctly. No question. It was veterinary

05:08.755 --> 05:16.945
medicine, and it was a veterinarian, and that was 
very clear. And you need to learn to spell it

05:17.005 --> 05:19.709
correctly. And back then, most of the times, even 
in the sciences, if you misspelled a word, it may be

05:20.870 --> 05:27.679
counted off. And boy, those medical terms were not 
easy. Now, his nickname was Slick Al. Slick Al.

05:35.531 --> 05:36.453
What did that mean? It was given before we got 
there, and I think, I never heard a lot of people

05:38.656 --> 05:50.774
discuss it, but I think that he was just so smooth in 
how he handled himself. That it wasn't that he was a

05:51.015 --> 05:53.919
slick operator putting one over? No, absolutely 
not. And you knew he was He was tough, he was

05:56.870 --> 06:02.179
straight, he was forward, and he was professional 
in every way. And I think it was a compliment, quite

06:03.020 --> 06:11.473
frankly, because he operated everything so 
smoothly and in such incredible order. That first

06:13.116 --> 06:16.862
year, did you all take all the same courses? 
Absolutely. We all had the same courses. But we had

06:21.338 --> 06:27.444
a little bit different schedules because we were 
broken into two sections of 32. What were the, as

06:27.544 --> 06:33.389
you now look back, what were the toughest? Oh, 
that's easy. The toughest courses were anatomy

06:35.651 --> 06:39.115
and physiology. Who taught those? Big John 
Miloff. And we called him Big John. He was about

06:45.000 --> 06:50.265
6'4",

06:45.000 --> 06:50.265
just a, tremendous teacher. And when he walked in, 
he commanded respect. And I'll never forget one

07:00.631 --> 07:10.626
day, one of my classmates asked him in histology 
lab, which we got only three hours of credit. He

07:11.627 --> 07:15.874
said, Dr. John, why is this just a three hour credit 
course? Because we were putting in many more

07:15.994 --> 07:17.897
hours. He said, well, son, We didn't want you 
taking too damn many hours this semester. That was

07:24.620 --> 07:26.702
his answer, and it was dropped then. And the other 
was clearly physiology. Who taught that? This one

07:34.030 --> 07:35.552
had a nickname. Great teacher, he's now deceased.

07:41.378 --> 07:42.879
His name was Dick Davis. Brilliant man. Could have 
taught in any medical school in the world. And he

07:50.050 --> 07:56.818
would get so excited in labs that he would almost 
froth at the mouth. And he was nicknamed Mad Dog

07:56.838 --> 07:59.060
Davis. And I'm sure that came because of his 
excitement. And he would just get so excited. And

08:05.027 --> 08:09.952
he had another professor with him that helped in 
labs. His last name was Sabonowicz. And that may be

08:13.116 --> 08:15.879
Polish, I think. But it was some Eastern European 
country. And the two of them would just, I mean, get

08:20.054 --> 08:33.429
into a comic situation over something happening 
with a dog on the physiograph in a physiology

08:20.054 --> 08:33.429
laboratory doing an experiment. We were just 
amazed at it, but boy, they were good. And was there

08:37.774 --> 08:41.519
any course that was fun? What was the most 
enjoyable of those? I loved the sciences. And I

08:48.522 --> 08:51.286
really enjoyed physiology. To me, it was fun 
because you would, for the first time, you get your

08:52.568 --> 09:05.969
hands on some animals, you could see the 
physiologic responses and systems of the body and

08:52.568 --> 09:05.969
the intricacies of how they worked. To me, it was 
the most fun course. It was a difficult course.

09:09.534 --> 09:14.361
Anatomy was something you knew you had to learn, 
but it wasn't very exciting. And I think the people

09:14.962 --> 09:17.466
who taught it would probably tell you that. I 
enjoyed biochemistry

09:18.087 --> 09:24.877
because I had another course of it in the first 
year. It was a tough course, but it was

09:24.918 --> 09:27.842
fundamental. The first year, both semesters or 
all three trimesters as I had it, you were really

09:28.683 --> 09:42.745
laying the foundations and the basics for what you 
really, in your mind, thought you were there to do.

09:43.265 --> 09:50.231
And you had to keep reminding yourself that I've 
got to accomplish this before I get to do the things

09:43.265 --> 09:50.231
of hands-on experiences. Now, over on the campus, 
part of the campus where I was working then, we

09:51.032 --> 09:57.538
posted grades publicly. Oh, absolutely. Is that 
right? Oh, yeah, we did too. All right, at the end of

10:00.661 --> 10:06.386
that first semester in general, what was the 
result for your class? I don't think we lost anyone

10:08.167 --> 10:13.272
except the young man that was just so burned out he 
left. I don't recall losing anyone the whole first

10:13.657 --> 10:30.976
year because they clearly had the aptitude to be 
able to handle it because when you take 64 out of

10:13.657 --> 10:30.976
600, you've got people there who have the 
intellect to handle it. And I don't recall

10:30.996 --> 10:39.225
anybody, but it was always interesting to go look 
because your grades were posted and your name was

10:30.996 --> 10:39.225
up there. Do you have any generalization about 
what kind of GPA, if we went to the bottom of the 64,

10:40.100 --> 10:51.136
the GPA was what or higher probably? I seriously 
would doubt anyone was in that class that was lower

10:52.297 --> 10:55.662
than 33. I would not think so. Now what was 
interesting was that all the high achievers were

10:58.763 --> 11:07.222
now put in there together and being challenged by 
professors that wanted to see how much they could

10:58.763 --> 11:07.222
challenge them. And for some of the people in the 
class to make their first C or D just absolutely

11:07.883 --> 11:13.836
crushed them. generalize about the makeup of the 
class. Where were they from geographically? All

11:21.738 --> 11:29.948
of them were from all parts of the state except for 
nine that were contract students from the state of

11:21.738 --> 11:29.948
Louisiana. And they were all different. And many 
of them were truly Cajun. And they taught Cajun.

11:36.957 --> 11:40.482
They brought their chicory coffee with them in the 
morning. But they were great to have with us. And

11:42.444 --> 11:43.806
they mixed in with us. It was interesting because 
the student composition of that 64 was made up of a

11:44.957 --> 12:07.003
lot of us that were very young, and a lot of students 
who already had a degree, a lot who had been out and

11:44.957 --> 12:07.003
worked for a number of years. We had people in my 
class, I'm sure, who were in their 30s, and yet here

12:07.303 --> 12:12.409
I was I got my undergraduate and my doctorate at the 
age of 23. So we were young, a lot of us. So there was a

12:21.369 --> 12:24.814
big mixture, and many of them were married with 
children. There were many of us that were looking

12:25.495 --> 12:27.518
for a wife. And so where were the Texans from? All 
over the state. I mean, it was really varied. One of

12:36.611 --> 12:41.097
my classmates my first year in veterinary college 
was from Sterling City. And one of my dear friends

12:41.684 --> 12:49.932
that housed next door was from Miami, Texas, way up 
in the panhandle. Were most of them small town,

12:49.952 --> 12:51.713
rural? I would say probably a higher percentage 
then than you would find today, yeah. Probably 60,

12:58.600 --> 13:02.263
65%.

13:05.486 --> 13:07.728
But that was also true of the whole student body, 
too. What was life like for that one young lady? You

13:12.211 --> 13:35.786
know that was interesting because if you look back 
at the 1963 annual you will see a full-page picture

13:12.211 --> 13:35.786
of me holding the door open for her walking into the 
small animal clinic and I think it signified and

13:12.211 --> 13:35.786
she understood that she had opened a new door. But 
she was a unique personality that enjoyed that

13:40.595 --> 13:44.480
position. And we treated her with great respect. 
She took a lot of joking, but it was never done in a

13:49.706 --> 13:57.856
way that she shouldn't be here. It was done in a way 
of, hey, you know, you're the first to do this.

14:02.242 --> 14:03.243
We're glad to have you. And she had the personality 
to just mix in like one of everyone else. What was

14:09.890 --> 14:10.951
her name? Her name was Sonia Oliphant. 
O-L-I-P-H-A-N-T? That's correct. Do you

14:16.680 --> 14:20.747
remember from where or what school? I'm not 
totally sure. I think it may have been Texas Tech.

14:26.776 --> 14:31.864
And I know that she later married a student that was 
in a class or two behind us and was in practice in the

14:32.823 --> 14:38.491
Lubbock area. So she did graduate. She graduated 
with us right on time. And so in the four years, or

14:43.038 --> 14:57.079
three years, she, as far as you were aware,

14:43.038 --> 14:57.079
was not treated inappropriately? Never, that I 
was aware of. I mean, she was included in

15:00.304 --> 15:01.986
everything. It was kind of like we were proud to 
have her. I really believe that that was part of the

15:08.533 --> 15:18.591
mentality of our class, that women were coming to 
A&M, she was the first in our veterinary class, and

15:08.533 --> 15:18.591
we were glad to have her. She was a good sport. 
personality and just mixed in with all of them. Now

15:24.815 --> 15:31.644
how did you all create a kind of community of 
friends? Did you do anything socially in your

15:31.664 --> 15:34.368
class? Oh yeah, and the veterinary college was 
well organized. The student body was well

15:38.333 --> 15:40.256
organized. We had what we call the student chapter 
of the American Veterinary Medical Association.

15:46.224 --> 15:50.991
And secondly, each class had its class officers.

15:51.730 --> 15:55.675
We had certain kinds of class functions and 
events. We had a mixer and a big barbecue at the

15:56.876 --> 16:03.144
start of our very first trimester. And that was for 
the whole student body. We would have class

16:09.953 --> 16:10.954
meetings. Where would it be held? It was held out at 
Old Fort Shiloh once. It was held over near Snook

16:16.381 --> 16:19.625
once. It was held over where current Texas Hall of 
Fame is and I'm trying to recall but I believe the

16:21.683 --> 16:34.841
second year class was responsible for putting it 
on for the first so that when you got to be the next

16:21.683 --> 16:34.841
year you put it on for that class. To whom did you 
turn for advice if you needed? You were assigned an

16:40.269 --> 16:46.037
advisor, an academic advisor who was a full tenure 
track faculty member in the college of veterinary

16:46.912 --> 17:15.805
medicine and if you had any kind of problem or need 
you went to that individual as well as with only 64

16:46.912 --> 17:15.805
students the dean's office uh dr mcmurray usually 
was available can you give an example of any advice

16:46.912 --> 17:15.805
you've sought and received i don't recall ever 
going things went smoothly and I don't recall ever

17:16.578 --> 17:22.608
having to go because we knew what our schedule was 
going to be. It was sent to us then. We didn't go

17:23.890 --> 17:25.252
negotiate it. Did you have a car by then? That first 
year in Vetchco? Yes. I finally had a car. And you

17:32.924 --> 17:33.785
lived where? I lived still in

17:34.226 --> 17:40.856
Law Hall my first year. I lived off campus my second 
over on College Main. And then my third year, I

17:48.325 --> 17:56.376
lived out at Welburton in an old house with three 
other veterinary students. I was the cook and they

17:57.117 --> 18:00.862
became the cleanup crew. And we could save 
tremendous amounts of money. Because we'd go to

18:05.108 --> 18:09.574
the grocery store and buy our food and I'd cook. 
That first year of vet school, how often did you go

18:09.735 --> 18:12.859
home? Not much. I probably didn't go home, but 
maybe once or twice. You're saying maybe

18:20.354 --> 18:22.516
Thanksgiving and Christmas? Yeah, and I recall, I 
know I went home the weekend that Kennedy was

18:23.177 --> 18:33.808
assassinated because I got back to the room. I had 
the radio on. Maybe they had announced it.

18:40.480 --> 18:43.803
over the loudspeakers at veterinary school. But I 
remember getting in my car and driving home,

18:43.823 --> 18:55.893
listening to the radio, and almost having trouble 
driving, trying to stay concentrated to the

18:43.823 --> 18:55.893
happenings that were occurring. And then that 
shooting of Jack Ruby in the police station

18:56.273 --> 19:04.400
occurred while some of us were in church Sunday 
morning. And I was at home. And I remember seeing

19:06.562 --> 19:10.065
that on television at home. before I drove back.

19:14.856 --> 19:19.260
This doesn't have anything to do with vet school, 
but does the real world. What was the reaction of

19:19.360 --> 19:24.084
you and your buddies to those events? I think 
everyone was just in a state of disbelief and

19:24.104 --> 19:33.092
almost shocked that that could occur, 
particularly that it could occur in Texas.

19:33.272 --> 19:40.018
Because I want to tell you, there is a Texas pride 
that is inborn and it is there forever. See, I was

19:40.201 --> 19:42.283
embarrassed. Absolutely. And I think we all felt 
that way. I had a 12-to-1 class, and I was to meet

19:46.867 --> 19:52.693
Garland Bayless, and we were going to the MSC. And I 
came in, and he was glued to this radio. And I said,

19:55.776 --> 19:57.718
come on, we've got to beat the line. He said, listen 
to the radio. I said, we can hear the darn radio. He

20:00.300 --> 20:01.081
said, listen. And I heard Cronkite say, I've just 
been given the notice. President Kennedy is dead.

20:08.264 --> 20:13.229
And my, my, my, I was stunned.

20:17.093 --> 20:24.621
The route, let's go back to a typical day while you, 
that first year of vet school. You got up, did you

20:24.661 --> 20:27.745
eat breakfast in the dining hall? I usually ate 
sabisa. And then went to climb. Immediately went

20:31.609 --> 20:33.050
across the tracks. At that time we were the only 
academic program across the tracks. And you,

20:39.007 --> 20:42.892
where'd you eat lunch? Normally, we would come to 
Northgate or maybe go to Savisa the first year.

20:54.228 --> 21:03.280
Later on, when we lived off campus or when I lived 
out at Welbert, we actually made our lunches and

21:03.783 --> 21:07.388
ate under the trees around the veterinary 
college. Normally you were over there in the

21:08.369 --> 21:12.754
afternoons until about what time? Oh, at least 5 
o'clock. Did you go back at night much? Not a whole

21:18.882 --> 21:22.707
lot.

21:22.727 --> 21:24.028
Rarely did I go back. Every once in a while I'd have 
to go to the library, and we did have the veterinary

21:24.870 --> 21:30.837
medical library, which is now the medical 
sciences library. and if I had to do some research

21:31.559 --> 21:34.103
or something. I never could study very well in the 
library. My personal best study was done to get in

21:36.566 --> 21:52.049
my room, close the doors, get it quiet, and believe 
it or not, I usually studied laying on the bed,

21:36.566 --> 21:52.049
sometimes laying on the bed with my notes in the 
floor and looking off on them. And did you have any

21:53.211 --> 21:57.037
Saturday classes over there? No, we had no 
Saturday classes until my senior year. What did

22:00.161 --> 22:01.363
you all do on Saturdays? Well Friday night was an 
off night. We rested, re-relaxed, we were dead.

22:08.247 --> 22:11.091
Saturday a lot of times we'd sleep in a little 
later. Of course we'd be involved with campus

22:11.131 --> 22:15.518
activities. And then a lot of times on Saturday 
nights we'd be back studying because we had so many

22:16.579 --> 22:25.272
major things happening. It was an accelerated 
program on the three year transition. Did many vet

22:28.476 --> 22:30.439
students party? on a Saturday night? Some did, but 
not like probably a lot of other students. As far as

22:37.253 --> 22:40.677
you know, if they were going to party, where did 
they go? Oh, gosh, what was the name of that place

22:41.778 --> 22:45.984
out on Highway 60? Not Uncle Ed's. No. Went to 
Whiskey Bridge. No, it was someplace out there. I

22:54.414 --> 22:57.538
never did go out there, but I can remember going out 
there. I remember talking about Whiskey Bridge.

23:00.507 --> 23:04.772
There was someplace out there that a lot of them 
went. Lakeview Club, I think, was open, so a few of

23:04.792 --> 23:08.155
them would go out there. How many of your 
classmates were smokers? That's an interesting

23:14.462 --> 23:15.744
question. There were probably, out of 64, I would 
say we probably had 15 maybe. Oh, that's all? Maybe

23:27.677 --> 23:28.978
20. But I tell you what, when they took histology 
and Dr. John Miliff showed them the inside of a

23:29.296 --> 23:41.431
smoker's lung, there were more of them that quit 
after that, after seeing what it would do. And he

23:41.551 --> 23:47.098
also showed them the lung tissue of a person with 
emphysema. And that spoke volumes because you

23:47.118 --> 23:51.203
were looking through a microscope at what it would 
do to the body and to the lungs. Did you and your

23:57.035 --> 24:00.681
buddies even know the terminology of drugs? No, 
you never heard of it. The only drug everyone back

24:02.744 --> 24:05.989
then was aware of was alcohol. One thing we did on 
Friday nights, or Saturday nights, the old Circle

24:08.212 --> 24:17.646
drive-in was still there, so we'd go to a drive-in 
movie. Every once in a while we'd drive over to Sam

24:18.824 --> 24:23.351
Houston. Now you met this special young lady your 
first year of vet school? My second. Second year.

24:30.442 --> 24:32.625
And you began to see her more often. Absolutely. 
When did it get serious? It wasn't long. I met her in

24:37.172 --> 24:38.434
October.

24:41.819 --> 24:46.266
I went to Austin for the UT A&M game. in November on 
Thanksgiving and met her parents that short

24:47.022 --> 25:14.262
period and then in December I actually went she was 
from Dilley down in South Texas and I actually went

24:47.022 --> 25:14.262
down where she lived and visited their family then 
and then the very next year she graduated the

24:47.022 --> 25:14.262
University of Texas in May and uh in Corpus and of 
course we were already real serious then and that

25:16.216 --> 25:35.136
was not working out because Corpus was so far away 
and there was no way and I was in my senior year by

25:16.216 --> 25:35.136
then there was no way I could go see her and of course 
she couldn't come up here every weekend And her

25:35.437 --> 25:42.365
lights went out on her car returning to Corpus one 
weekend after being up here for a football game. So

25:42.385 --> 25:51.776
in October of my senior year, before I graduated 
the next August, we decided that we were going to

25:42.385 --> 25:51.776
get married. And we just prayed that she could find 
a teaching job at Bryan College Station. And her

25:59.364 --> 26:03.469
mother and dad came in October for a football game 
here. And by that time, she had another brother

26:04.563 --> 26:07.327
here. And down at the old Bryan Holiday Inn, which 
is now a private dorm, I asked everybody to leave

26:08.589 --> 26:21.589
the room, and I talked to her dad and asked 
permission to marry her. I had already given her

26:22.270 --> 26:24.714
the ring earlier that weekend. And he gave us our 
blessings, and we got married in December. That

26:30.432 --> 26:31.273
same year? Of your fourth year in vet school. Third 
year in vet school. Third year in vet school. It was

26:35.781 --> 26:37.824
December 26, 1965. All right, and so then she is 
here teaching? She started teaching here in

26:44.014 --> 26:49.943
January at Bowie, Bowie Elementary in downtown 
Bryant. So your fourth year, I mean, you're, oh,

26:50.024 --> 26:53.910
no. My senior year, third year. Yeah, yeah, you're 
finishing. Right. At that point, who had

26:57.635 --> 27:12.156
influenced, which individual or what course had 
influenced you most in the DVM program? That's

27:12.176 --> 27:12.716
easy. I was influenced by just the excitement the 
challenge, the glamour of small animal surgery.

27:26.487 --> 27:34.003
Because what was so exciting was that we were doing 
then and implementing and bringing the surgical

27:34.743 --> 27:41.352
procedures that were being done in the human to the 
small animal, and people were willing to pay for

27:34.743 --> 27:41.352
it. I'm talking about cataract surgery, I'm 
talking about all kinds of orthopedic surgery,

27:41.593 --> 27:51.787
and my heart and my interest was in spinal and 
neurosurgery. And there was a professor named Don

27:52.888 --> 28:04.024
Piermatti who was probably one of the most 
professional

27:52.888 --> 28:04.024
individuals I was ever around. and his influence 
of scrubbing in with him. And two things happened

28:09.752 --> 28:11.534
that year. One is that Rudder's dog, Old Ranger, 
who was the campus mascot. And when I was an

28:18.540 --> 28:23.845
undergrad here, we would take him and put him in the 
seat in a classroom with us. And he always was over

28:23.865 --> 28:25.347
there. We'd wait for him to cross the street. We'd 
take him into Sabisa. He got a kidney stone. And I

28:32.557 --> 28:35.641
got to scrub in on that procedure. And then later in 
the year, Reveille had some surgical problem that

28:36.622 --> 28:44.652
I don't recall specifically what it was now. I also 
got to scrub in on that. And I just have always been a

28:48.376 --> 28:52.862
person driven by challenge. That's why I could 
never have been in a routine private practice. It

28:58.869 --> 29:00.471
would have bored me to death. And when I could see 
the challenge of what they were doing, the

29:01.193 --> 29:10.142
pioneering that could be done in it, the research 
that could be done in it, I was turned on to that. And

29:10.682 --> 29:19.291
I immediately, prior to even my senior year, had 
begun to think about, I want to go into teaching and

29:10.682 --> 29:19.291
research. And ultimately, I want to get into a 
leadership role of what's happening in this kind

29:20.091 --> 29:27.599
of an educational field. So I had to start 
preparing myself for it. So I began to look And

29:31.636 --> 29:38.804
after graduation, where could I go and get 
post-doctoral training in the area where I wanted

29:31.636 --> 29:38.804
to pursue? Who did you turn to as a counselor for 
those serious thoughts? Well, Dr. Pierre Maddy

29:43.049 --> 29:47.594
was one, and Dr. Lynn Huroff was another in small 
animal. And I also went to Dr. Price and talked to

29:48.155 --> 29:53.621
him about it. And of course, it was clear that if I 
wanted to pursue an academic career, that I had to

29:59.716 --> 30:02.360
go on and do post-doctoral work. So they were very 
good in giving me contacts of other veterinary

30:03.302 --> 30:13.338
medical colleges around the nation. I was given an 
offer to come be a post-doctoral student both at

30:14.560 --> 30:22.332
Colorado State University and at Auburn 
University. I would much prefer probably to have

30:23.341 --> 30:28.386
gone to Colorado State and lived in the mountains. 
But Auburn had the premier neurosurgeon in

30:28.946 --> 30:33.371
America. And I'll never forget, they actually 
flew me up there to have an interview. And it was

30:43.981 --> 30:48.265
only my second time ever in an airplane. And they 
offered me the job while I was there. which was a

30:52.315 --> 30:57.311
post-doctoral research fellow in the Scott 
Ritchie program. And my salary would be $7,580 a

30:58.696 --> 31:03.692
year.

31:28.310 --> 31:32.439
And what is amazing is that I graduated from A&E.

31:36.027 --> 31:36.728
Because we were on.

31:47.612 --> 31:48.394
And we loaded.
