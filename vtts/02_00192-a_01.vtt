00:02.731 --> 00:19.571
September 14, a beautiful, clear, bright, sunny day in central Missouri, sitting at the home of George and Joy Shelton, getting ready to chat with Dr. Shelton about his recollections of some A&M years.

00:19.591 --> 00:21.593
George, now let's test your microphone.

00:21.693 --> 00:23.195
Say a sentence or so.

00:24.676 --> 00:25.738
So what now?

00:25.798 --> 00:26.278
That's enough.

00:26.398 --> 00:27.760
Oh, oh.

00:30.997 --> 00:37.926
George, you enrolled the first time at A&M in what year?

00:38.487 --> 00:41.350
September the 27th, 1945.

00:43.493 --> 00:43.994
Okay.

00:44.014 --> 00:54.207
I had two years of college work that I had completed at what was then John Tarleton Agricultural College.

00:55.309 --> 00:58.793
For the sake of someone who might not be

00:59.262 --> 01:03.331
completely familiar with your background.

01:04.313 --> 01:11.989
If you will, tell us where you grew up and experience of that sort before you came to A&M.

01:14.028 --> 01:16.290
I grew up at Stephenville, Texas.

01:17.111 --> 01:20.374
Lived there the first 18 years of my life.

01:22.015 --> 01:24.277
Was a farm boy.

01:24.297 --> 01:35.067
We lived on a very small depression-ridden farm in south of Stephenville, a few miles.

01:36.969 --> 01:41.453
And what encouraged you to go to college in the first place?

01:42.698 --> 01:49.585
Well, I think that question depends on the timing.

01:50.425 --> 02:10.765
For young men and women that lived in the 30s, growing up in the 30s, maturing, finishing high school and so forth, I think there was a feeling that education might be the only way out

02:11.538 --> 02:16.183
of what was then really a rural ghetto.

02:18.606 --> 02:34.204
And so, although I grew up in a family that didn't have higher education at all, neither my mother or father had finished high school, but from my earliest days of recollection,

02:34.994 --> 03:03.162
I was encouraged to get every bit of education I could and so when I graduated from high school I started to John Tarleton and I worked at home milk cows before going to school and hauled the milk in myself on the way to school and

03:03.142 --> 03:14.387
was able to get two years in, equivalent of two years in college before I was drafted into the armed services in late 1942.

03:15.008 --> 03:18.636
Had of course

03:19.072 --> 03:32.194
hadn't been out of high school but about, what would it have been, about eight, seven, eight months when we had Pearl Harbor and associated incidents.

03:32.214 --> 03:45.096
And so because our nation was so far behind in military preparation and preparedness, there was no way they could

03:45.987 --> 03:51.635
take all the young men that were 18 to 20 years old immediately.

03:52.717 --> 04:00.448
So they allowed us to stay in school a few months, and I was able to stay until December 1942.

04:02.210 --> 04:14.087
And actually didn't go on active duty until about, let's see, about the second or third day of 1943.

04:15.097 --> 04:24.591
as you were studying at Tarleton, did you have an academic goal, a major, a profession already in mind?

04:26.695 --> 04:28.998
Yes, Haskell, I had a goal.

04:30.320 --> 04:34.867
I didn't know that I could achieve it, but I wanted to be a veterinarian.

04:36.229 --> 04:42.859
And I took what they called at that point a pre-vet curriculum of two years.

04:42.839 --> 04:51.289
which I did in quite a bit less than two years because I went to school in the summer of 42.

04:51.650 --> 05:03.744
As you look back on that program, given your experience to date, how adequate was that program if it was only going to be a two-year period of study?

05:04.926 --> 05:10.552
If I couldn't have gotten anything but those two years?

05:12.054 --> 05:12.795
For pre-vet?

05:13.670 --> 05:15.753
Oh, it was fine for pre-vet.

05:16.534 --> 05:23.364
Actually, at that point in time, one year was all that was required.

05:24.545 --> 05:31.315
And it had to be a certain arrangement of chemistry and mathematics and so forth.

05:31.355 --> 05:34.139
But one year was all that was required.

05:34.179 --> 05:38.665
It was raised to two years right after World War II ended.

05:39.640 --> 06:00.619
uh... but i had uh... my my pre-professional work was all right i uh... tell you a little story about uh... well maybe i'm getting ahead of myself uh... when i finished uh... uh... the first two years of uh... work there and and went into the armed services i was in

06:00.599 --> 06:03.607
almost three years, about two years and eight or nine months.

06:05.030 --> 06:16.178
And when the war ended so suddenly, as it did in 1945, almost unbelievably,

06:16.816 --> 06:20.664
none of us realized that we could be mustered out so fast.

06:22.006 --> 06:37.778
I had returned from overseas in late April, early May of 1945 and sent to Ellington Field, Texas.

06:39.057 --> 06:41.120
where I was literally marking time.

06:42.222 --> 06:43.985
Didn't really have much need for me.

06:45.006 --> 07:02.213
And so when the war ended so quickly, I was able to, I had my, the transcript of my two years at Tarleton that I had gotten on when I stopped with my parents' farm in Stephenville and I took it back to

07:02.952 --> 07:04.213
with me to Ellington.

07:04.233 --> 07:14.684
And so when it looked like I was going to be mustered out, I was thinking about how to get in school as soon as I could.

07:14.704 --> 07:27.858
And I went to, well, I guess I didn't actually go to see Dr. Marcella, who was dean, until I was discharged.

07:29.099 --> 07:32.503
But on my way home, I stopped by a car station

07:32.821 --> 07:36.776
and saw Dr. Marcella, and I had no idea what to expect.

07:38.301 --> 07:42.898
And unknown to me at that time, his health was beginning to break.

07:43.942 --> 07:52.835
But I stopped in his office and showed him my meager credentials and told him that I would like to go to veterinary school.

07:53.697 --> 08:03.031
He looked at my transcript and he said, well, you don't have one course that we require.

08:03.051 --> 08:07.097
I said, you don't have the right agricultural chemistry course.

08:08.343 --> 08:12.008
So I said, all right, what do I have to do?

08:12.469 --> 08:13.671
I have to take another semester.

08:14.552 --> 08:17.096
And of course, I knew I couldn't get in except in the fall.

08:19.039 --> 08:22.343
Oh, I said, you can take it with the other work.

08:24.046 --> 08:29.514
The semester, the first year in veterinary school was something like 18 hours.

08:31.076 --> 08:34.761
And I had to add five hours on top of that.

08:34.781 --> 08:35.903
So I had a pretty good load.

08:36.608 --> 08:38.811
I had no idea what I could do with it.

08:39.412 --> 08:41.154
All right, now this is the fall of 40?

08:41.174 --> 08:41.374
45.

08:41.394 --> 08:42.356
45.

08:44.458 --> 08:45.119
And?

08:45.440 --> 08:52.429
The war had, I was discharged on the 22nd, entered veterinary school the 27th of September.

08:52.449 --> 08:53.010
September.

08:53.851 --> 09:02.002
All right, now one of my first questions normally, if I'm talking to someone who is an undergraduate, would be why did you attend A&M?

09:02.022 --> 09:05.046
Well, you attended A&M because it was the only vet school in the state.

09:06.410 --> 09:18.282
And when you came back to enroll, you had been there two, how many times had you visited A&M before you came to enroll?

09:19.343 --> 09:20.504
How many times had you been to college?

09:20.524 --> 09:23.507
Maybe for, maybe one time for about two hours.

09:25.269 --> 09:25.369
Okay.

09:25.389 --> 09:27.951
What did you bring with you physically?

09:28.032 --> 09:32.596
What, as a student, what did you, what did you carry?

09:32.676 --> 09:33.497
What stuff?

09:35.603 --> 09:46.741
Now, if you recall what it was like in 1945, that question may be moot.

09:50.027 --> 09:51.028
You couldn't buy anything.

09:51.048 --> 09:56.397
I had no clothes, no civilian clothes, because I gained a little bit of weight.

09:56.815 --> 10:03.023
And anyway, what I had left that I'd left back in 42 were mostly rags anyway.

10:04.024 --> 10:05.986
So I couldn't buy a shirt.

10:06.467 --> 10:07.748
I couldn't buy trousers.

10:07.868 --> 10:09.090
I couldn't buy a car.

10:09.350 --> 10:11.373
I couldn't buy anything, really.

10:11.993 --> 10:13.415
Because it was nothing for sale.

10:13.435 --> 10:14.837
And you didn't have a typewriter.

10:15.197 --> 10:16.479
Oh, I didn't have a typewriter.

10:16.719 --> 10:18.061
I didn't know how to type anyway.

10:18.942 --> 10:20.764
How did you get there from Stephenville?

10:22.432 --> 10:26.897
Well, usually I was able to catch rides.

10:28.539 --> 10:47.140
But that day, I had my father's old Plymouth, 1936 Plymouth, that I had gotten when I was at home just a few days before I got a weekend pass.

10:47.626 --> 10:51.352
Caught a ride home, took the old Plymouth back to Ellington.

10:52.013 --> 10:56.800
So I was actually driving his car then, which I went on home and left.

10:57.601 --> 10:59.885
Caught a ride back.

10:59.905 --> 11:03.370
So you came down to begin classes.

11:04.692 --> 11:05.573
Where did you live?

11:08.097 --> 11:11.963
Lived almost all the way through.

11:12.736 --> 11:22.450
I lived in the old brick building right down south of Cebisa.

11:24.153 --> 11:26.917
I'm trying to call it Howell Hall, but that isn't right.

11:28.139 --> 11:31.724
Hilton Hall Hall.

11:32.185 --> 11:39.696
Now, was that building occupied by a number of professional and or graduate students?

11:39.716 --> 11:41.038
Who else was in that building?

11:41.457 --> 11:45.841
All the students that were non-core, non-reg.

11:46.542 --> 11:53.908
A lot of non-reg students, engineers, veterinarian students, the works.

11:54.829 --> 12:00.134
Describe as well as you can recall it, what was the student body like in the fall of 1945?

12:00.274 --> 12:05.799
It was very definitely a two-segment situation.

12:06.540 --> 12:10.283
The core was still strong and there were a lot of youngsters.

12:11.512 --> 12:26.749
My veterinary class that I entered in in the fall of 1945 had about one third kiddos that had just finished one year or two years of pre-professional requirement.

12:26.769 --> 12:29.852
They were very military and the rest of them were veterans.

12:30.853 --> 12:39.983
And some of them were veterans that were returning that had been either wounded or suffered some kind of disability.

12:40.570 --> 12:42.593
There weren't many in my category.

12:42.613 --> 12:43.494
They had just gotten out.

12:43.514 --> 12:49.041
Because I was very, very fortunate to have, I was in the Southwest Pacific.

12:50.042 --> 12:54.828
I was through a lot of battle zones, and they had a point system.

12:56.109 --> 12:59.213
And you got five points for this and 10 points for that.

12:59.233 --> 13:06.983
Of course, I had little less than three years of service, so I didn't have enough points in time and grade.

13:07.942 --> 13:21.985
but I had a lot of, earned a lot of extra points, so it seemed to me like you had to have 85 points, and maybe I had 86 or something like that.

13:22.005 --> 13:24.009
I don't remember that, but it is something like that.

13:24.029 --> 13:26.873
Do you remember how much money you brought with you?

13:28.196 --> 13:29.658
How much money I brought with me?

13:30.219 --> 13:31.902
Did you have a pocket full of cash?

13:32.583 --> 13:33.865
I suppose.

13:34.840 --> 13:37.749
No, I don't remember, but it wasn't very much.

13:40.056 --> 13:43.967
See, I was able to go to school on the GI Bill.

13:44.669 --> 13:47.618
And you remember, what was that called, technically?

13:48.003 --> 13:58.978
GI Bill, it was a Veterans Support Act or something of Congress that had been passed just a few months before.

13:59.018 --> 14:11.395
And so they paid $50 a month and your tuition.

14:12.421 --> 14:20.850
But the $50 a month, you had to get your room and board and all your incidentals and everything.

14:22.192 --> 14:29.781
And that, of course, the dollars were a great deal different in 1945, but that still was pension.

14:29.801 --> 14:31.943
And so it wasn't too long.

14:32.023 --> 14:38.050
The first raise we got, maybe after a semester, I think it went to $65 a month.

14:38.530 --> 14:40.032
And we were in clover then, you know.

14:41.176 --> 14:45.987
Now, you were talking about clothing being scarce.

14:46.448 --> 14:49.474
Did you wear some old GI clothing?

14:49.815 --> 14:50.376
For a while.

14:50.597 --> 14:51.579
It was whatever you could get.

14:51.619 --> 14:58.915
I'm sure if you had pictures of those first classes, it was a model to crew.

14:59.367 --> 15:04.892
About, as far as you remember, about how many were in the entering class at the vet school that fall?

15:04.912 --> 15:06.793
We had, they took 64.

15:06.833 --> 15:07.074
64.

15:07.414 --> 15:10.196
I'm not absolutely sure we had 64.

15:10.537 --> 15:23.868
I think it may have been more like 60, and they added a few students that had dropped out after one semester, been called into service, and that sort of thing.

15:23.888 --> 15:28.412
Do you remember anything about how they received you and your classmates

15:28.763 --> 15:30.071
that first day or two?

15:30.171 --> 15:33.893
How did they welcome you?

15:33.913 --> 15:35.905
How did they assimilate you?

15:37.353 --> 15:46.769
I'm not sure that the university campus people had any idea what to do.

15:47.631 --> 15:51.898
They still didn't know how to integrate the veterans with the Corps kids.

15:52.839 --> 15:59.631
And for a few days we had to eat over in the Corps area.

16:00.995 --> 16:07.985
And, of course, you're supposed to jump up and down and know all the words for the food and all of that.

16:08.045 --> 16:17.619
And veterans that had been shot up in France or flown 50 missions in Germany, they weren't too interested in that, you know.

16:18.641 --> 16:25.952
So it wasn't, it didn't take but just a little until they began to separate them, get them separated as quickly as they could.

16:25.992 --> 16:27.955
They wasn't going to work.

16:28.275 --> 16:29.517
Where did you all eat things?

16:29.733 --> 16:32.338
Where did you eat then after the separation?

16:32.798 --> 16:35.443
Back at Sabisa.

16:35.683 --> 16:40.111
What was the name of that dorm where I lived all that time?

16:40.191 --> 16:44.358
I tried to call it Hilton, but Halton?

16:44.378 --> 16:45.240
Heaton?

16:45.260 --> 16:45.420
No.

16:46.121 --> 16:47.965
Oh, I don't know.

16:48.145 --> 16:51.150
At the vet school, was there any kind of welcome?

16:51.468 --> 17:04.861
Did the dean or anybody welcome new students?

17:04.881 --> 17:06.703
Almost none.

17:08.304 --> 17:10.726
We were told where to go to class.

17:11.848 --> 17:14.790
Describe the campus physically as it was then.

17:15.251 --> 17:17.593
What important buildings were where?

17:22.417 --> 17:28.707
Well, there was the new area, and we all called it that, you know, the new area.

17:29.549 --> 17:32.233
That was where most of the things were going on.

17:32.293 --> 17:47.698
Then the older part of the campus, the dormitories were kind of a hodgepodge, as still is today, those that are still standing there.

17:48.016 --> 17:51.980
And by the way, the one I can't remember the name of, it's still standing.

17:52.140 --> 17:54.963
It was refurbished, remodeled, and still there.

17:56.024 --> 18:03.471
So, of course, the campus was much smaller, but not a great deal different.

18:04.212 --> 18:06.354
Where was the vet school then?

18:06.594 --> 18:11.238
The veterinary school was down on the east end of Ross Street.

18:11.258 --> 18:11.739
Still there.

18:12.880 --> 18:15.002
Now I think occupied by...

18:15.809 --> 18:17.531
One of the engineering colleges.

18:18.433 --> 18:23.139
Maybe chemical engineering or one of those.

18:23.159 --> 18:26.765
And the entire vet school was in that one building?

18:26.805 --> 18:28.227
All except Francis Hall.

18:28.647 --> 18:31.491
Where were the facilities for the animals?

18:33.114 --> 18:38.741
Back on what is now the golf course.

18:38.762 --> 18:39.623
Back to the east.

18:40.764 --> 18:44.770
And there was Dr. Leonard had a little

18:45.593 --> 18:59.047
garden-like area just to the north of the veterinary facilities where they kept some old skates, horses that could barely walk, starve to death.

19:00.228 --> 19:04.993
And the neighboring community didn't care for that.

19:06.514 --> 19:12.740
So they gave the veterinary college a little more land that wouldn't be quite so obvious by the highway.

19:13.021 --> 19:15.263
The highway came in from Bryan then.

19:16.424 --> 19:26.398
And that first fall, which courses gave you the greatest difficulty?

19:27.600 --> 19:34.610
And which faculty do you remember with greatest respect from that first year?

19:35.492 --> 19:36.193
The first year?

19:37.915 --> 19:46.127
Well, the first year, there were about three courses that were considered the weed-out courses.

19:47.440 --> 19:49.343
Of course, gross anatomy was one of them.

19:51.006 --> 19:57.358
It was what we called osteology, myology, and angiology.

19:57.418 --> 20:04.531
The bone structure, then the muscle criteria, and then the vessels, nerves, and so forth.

20:05.352 --> 20:09.600
The first course was taught by a man by the name of Sam Cruz.

20:10.171 --> 20:16.117
K-R-U-E-Z-E, I believe, something like that.

20:16.137 --> 20:24.245
And Sam was a diabetic, and unknown to any of us, he was a great actor.

20:26.948 --> 20:36.077
He didn't give you much reason for why you were studying the bones and why you were studying them first and why you ought to learn about them.

20:37.306 --> 20:40.649
Sam assumed that you ought to know if you were going to be a veterinarian.

20:42.872 --> 20:45.755
So he had a stone face.

20:45.775 --> 20:47.857
We all called him old stone face.

20:47.877 --> 20:49.358
He never smiled.

20:50.319 --> 21:02.051
Sit up in the front of the room and he had a project that he was doing that had an old leather jacket and he was disassembling it and teasing all of the string out of it.

21:03.993 --> 21:06.756
And so

21:07.968 --> 21:19.085
The first exams is one of the highlights of my memory because I had been a pretty good student, I thought, adequate anyway, in my pre-veterinary years.

21:20.267 --> 21:24.233
I had a little maturity on me by then and thought I knew something.

21:25.756 --> 21:29.982
We had the first exam.

21:30.203 --> 21:32.787
They called them the letter exams.

21:32.807 --> 21:34.870
They probably still had those when you came in.

21:36.284 --> 21:39.489
Well, we took the A exam or the E or whatever the first one was.

21:39.529 --> 21:45.139
And I thought, well, that wasn't too bad.

21:45.179 --> 21:46.381
Of course, we heard.

21:46.681 --> 21:49.486
We heard all the rumors about how bad it was.

21:50.388 --> 21:51.730
I didn't think it was all that bad.

21:52.952 --> 21:53.693
So we got it.

21:53.793 --> 21:57.299
We got the exam like on a, we took it on a Thursday or Friday.

21:57.379 --> 22:00.404
And we didn't get it back in the middle of next week.

22:02.007 --> 22:02.528
And

22:03.655 --> 22:08.640
When I got mine back, it looked like it had been bleeding for weeks.

22:08.960 --> 22:15.267
Sam used a red pencil heavy whip, and that thing was marked from one side to the other and up and down.

22:15.327 --> 22:18.790
I got a grade of something like 62 or 64.

22:21.233 --> 22:23.935
Well, I tell you, I was pretty put out.

22:24.095 --> 22:26.218
I didn't know what in the world to think.

22:26.238 --> 22:30.642
I thought, if I thought I was doing fairly well, then I'd get a grade like this.

22:32.258 --> 22:39.768
So I very, very well remember that we all sat there in a sudden shock.

22:41.089 --> 22:45.014
But I thought, well, I know what I can do.

22:45.034 --> 22:52.204
So after it was over, it was a very short distance over to the main administration building, as you recall.

22:53.525 --> 22:57.731
So I walked over there to see what would be involved if I made a quick transfer.

22:59.333 --> 23:01.135
And maybe I wouldn't lose any time.

23:01.418 --> 23:15.273
Funny thing about it was that young men at that time that had spent three years, four years, some of them even five, in military service, we thought our lives had passed us by.

23:17.255 --> 23:21.139
And we didn't want to lose another minute.

23:22.481 --> 23:30.970
Well, I knew I didn't want to be a victim of that hemorrhagic situation.

23:31.270 --> 23:35.235
I found out what I could do and how I could transfer, and I said, well.

23:35.736 --> 23:39.440
Then I talked to some of the others, and they said, well, we better hang with it a little while longer.

23:40.481 --> 23:47.430
But it helped a little bit when I found out that 62 or 64, whatever it was, wasn't a bad grade.

23:47.530 --> 23:50.594
So I felt a little better.

23:50.614 --> 23:54.639
Anyway, then I had Dr. Burns, Patton W. Burns.

23:54.659 --> 23:57.042
He was literally a

23:57.359 --> 24:00.724
historical figure on campus and a wonderful old gentleman.

24:00.744 --> 24:01.925
But he was tough, too.

24:02.947 --> 24:06.451
It had to be like Patton wanted it.

24:06.471 --> 24:14.782
And then I had Dr. Ralph Dunn, who later became the dean after Dr. Marstella had to give up the position.

24:15.964 --> 24:23.234
And he was a pathologist, and he was a great teacher, the best, but tough, too.

24:23.995 --> 24:27.079
There weren't a bunch of easy, there weren't snaps there.

24:27.650 --> 24:35.679
But there were a wonderful group of teachers, most of them, a couple exceptions.

24:36.621 --> 24:42.968
During those first months, to whom did you turn, if you needed advice, counsel?

24:45.671 --> 24:47.273
I didn't.

24:47.994 --> 24:49.596
It was a peculiar thing.

24:49.656 --> 24:54.822
All advice you got then was from upperclassmen.

24:55.595 --> 24:58.641
All right, now, but none of them would have been veterans, would they?

24:59.342 --> 25:01.166
Most of them were not.

25:01.306 --> 25:01.466
Okay.

25:01.667 --> 25:02.448
Not for a year.

25:02.588 --> 25:03.510
That's what I think.

25:03.530 --> 25:09.822
Now, see, what had happened, some of them had gotten one year in vet school, called active duty, some two.

25:09.842 --> 25:13.249
So after a bit, they began to string back in.

25:13.752 --> 25:20.042
But that first semester or two, well, you just didn't have much help, or I didn't.

25:20.583 --> 25:35.266
Now, I think some of them probably felt, some of the students felt comfortable with going to people like Dr. Kirk or Dr. John Milliff, who was one of the great teachers I ever saw anywhere, any time.

25:35.747 --> 25:37.349
Let's stay with him.

25:37.369 --> 25:38.511
What made him great?

25:38.997 --> 25:41.660
Why do you give him high marks?

25:41.680 --> 25:42.721
What made him great?

25:43.041 --> 25:44.462
He knew his subject for one thing.

25:44.522 --> 25:45.784
He absolutely wasn't.

25:47.505 --> 25:53.231
He taught anatomy, but he was just as good or better a pathologist.

25:54.072 --> 25:59.016
So he was able to show us why we needed to learn anatomy.

26:00.998 --> 26:04.161
But we didn't get him for the second or third semester.

26:05.643 --> 26:06.844
And what were his

26:07.060 --> 26:11.588
And then he was just a wonderful man, gentle, calm man.

26:11.628 --> 26:15.915
He never embarrassed a student.

26:15.935 --> 26:20.142
Just one of those men that they don't make many of.

26:20.162 --> 26:21.565
Now he must have had a nickname.

26:21.645 --> 26:23.408
What was Dr. Miller's nickname?

26:23.428 --> 26:24.570
Dr. John's all I ever heard.

26:24.890 --> 26:26.173
That's all I've ever heard.

26:26.373 --> 26:27.515
Yeah.

26:27.535 --> 26:29.338
I never heard anything else.

26:29.977 --> 26:33.300
Let's see, I started to say Turk, that's not right.

26:33.320 --> 26:38.104
Who was it you mentioned a while ago, another old timer, a faculty member?

26:40.026 --> 26:40.146
Burns.

26:40.166 --> 26:42.368
No, and Burns, I'm trying to think of somebody else.

26:43.709 --> 26:51.336
Dr. Burns, Dr. Eads, I didn't mention Dr. Eads, he was in the same department, he was pharmacology.

26:52.097 --> 26:54.399
There's another, we'll get back to him.

26:54.419 --> 26:58.262
Now let's see, what was a typical, that first year,

26:58.647 --> 27:00.590
What was a typical day?

27:00.930 --> 27:19.795
You got up at what time, went to eat, went to... Well, for me, because I was taking the five hours additional work, a typical day involved going to class somewhere around 8 o'clock and sometimes finishing at 5.30, 6 o'clock.

27:20.877 --> 27:24.942
How many of those hours were in the classroom and how many in the lab?

27:26.373 --> 27:35.445
In the classroom there would be structured classes, lectures, and that was what they taught by then was mostly lectures.

27:37.547 --> 27:47.881
There would have been five to six hours of lecture a day and all three to six hours of lab.

27:47.901 --> 27:50.604
That's Monday through Friday, then Saturday.

27:50.664 --> 27:53.007
Saturday we had classes also then.

27:53.668 --> 27:55.030
Those are finished on the

27:55.381 --> 27:58.444
accelerated program, we had classes till noon on Saturday.

28:00.065 --> 28:05.670
Usually we had lectures, Monday, Wednesday, Friday, Tuesday, Thursday, Saturday.

28:06.791 --> 28:08.472
You got up about what time?

28:09.433 --> 28:09.993
On Saturday?

28:10.194 --> 28:12.455
No, no, on a typical class day.

28:12.495 --> 28:13.616
Did you get up and go to breakfast?

28:14.537 --> 28:18.340
Yeah, I did, because I think I could have made it without some breakfast.

28:19.261 --> 28:22.244
Did y'all go through a chai line?

28:22.264 --> 28:22.564
Yeah.

28:22.964 --> 28:24.966
We had kind of a cafeteria style.

28:25.385 --> 28:26.587
Buffet style.

28:26.607 --> 28:27.468
In Cebiza?

28:27.488 --> 28:28.890
Cebiza.

28:29.110 --> 28:32.656
I ate in Cebiza almost the whole time I was there.

28:33.497 --> 28:37.603
Where did you learn all of the Aggie lingo?

28:37.623 --> 28:38.624
I never did know it all.

28:39.926 --> 28:44.853
But I learned a lot of it from the kids that were CORE members.

28:45.935 --> 28:49.620
And we learned a little of it that first two or three weeks.

28:49.955 --> 28:53.840
when they made us eat in the cafeteria in the core area.

28:54.520 --> 28:54.701
Oh, okay.

28:54.721 --> 29:01.128
Because they wouldn't give you anything unless you knew it was bully or, you know, what it was, what the word for it was.

29:02.430 --> 29:06.534
All right, and so all your meals were cafeteria style?

29:06.895 --> 29:07.576
Virtually all.

29:07.916 --> 29:08.196
Okay.

29:09.017 --> 29:15.385
Of the food that you remember, what were your favorites and your least favorite?

29:15.565 --> 29:18.308
Which food did they do that was really...

29:19.233 --> 29:21.835
special and there must have been two or three things you didn't like?

29:22.296 --> 29:23.397
Oh, I'm sure there were.

29:23.417 --> 29:28.761
That's quite a hard question for me to answer because I don't really remember that too well.

29:29.542 --> 29:36.668
See, I'd come back from the Southwest Pacific and I had nothing to eat there but powdered foods.

29:37.909 --> 29:44.594
Powdered sugar, I mean powdered potatoes, powdered milk, everything you could dehydrate.

29:45.575 --> 29:46.396
That's all you got.

29:46.616 --> 29:48.818
They couldn't get any fresh food at all.

29:49.135 --> 30:09.616
So when we got to A&M and we saw things like oranges or lettuce, or even though I don't like lettuce all that much, or the cold broccoli, and then, oh, we just thought that was just like, you know, out of this world.

30:09.636 --> 30:11.578
I was in heaven already.

30:12.519 --> 30:16.924
For the food in Cebesa, I never had any gripe.

30:16.944 --> 30:18.906
And so I can't answer your question, really.

30:19.156 --> 30:20.218
All right, let's see.

30:20.358 --> 30:24.464
In the dormitories, did you do your studying in the dorm?

30:24.924 --> 30:25.305
Usually.

30:25.706 --> 30:27.288
Describe your dorm room.

30:28.289 --> 30:30.913
My dorm room was, oh, golly.

30:32.495 --> 30:34.518
I wish I could think of that blooming name.

30:34.679 --> 30:47.998
The first semester I was in school, I had a roommate that was, I think, something like an arts and science kid.

30:49.075 --> 30:58.105
And he was playboy, didn't study, and of course here I am in veterinary medicine, and I had my nose buried in the book till 10, 11, 12 o'clock every night.

30:59.467 --> 31:09.078
Then the next day, next semester, I roomed with a man by the name of Willie Trajan.

31:10.039 --> 31:11.020
And Willie's still living.

31:11.140 --> 31:18.188
He was a little older than I am, but he lived and practiced in East Texas and in Louisiana.

31:20.176 --> 31:25.564
We were both, I guess, in today's language, we were nerds.

31:27.407 --> 31:31.773
We kept our nose clean in the books.

31:31.953 --> 31:45.593
Our biggest entertainment was, oh, whatsoever weekend, not every weekend, but maybe once a month or so, we'd go out to that...

31:48.492 --> 31:51.169
Now, I should have looked up some of these names.

31:51.330 --> 31:53.845
I can't recall what they...
