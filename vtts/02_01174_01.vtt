WEBVTT

00:05.735 --> 00:08.138
OK, I'll say something, and Bill, say something. 
All right. OK, this is Ron Shorn interviewing Bill

00:10.862 --> 00:17.029
Hubbard at Boulder, Colorado, on October 21, 
1993. Bill, for the record, would you give your

00:18.672 --> 00:21.095
full name? William Bogle Hubbard. How do you spell 
the middle name? B-O-G-E-L, German name. And when

00:27.443 --> 00:28.684
and where were you born? Born in Liberty, Texas, 
November 14, 1940. How'd you get interested in

00:34.878 --> 00:38.283
astronomy? Well, I received a book from a friend of 
my father's when I was a kid about planets, which I

00:38.443 --> 00:46.975
found very interesting. And I also spent a number 
of summers during my childhood in the vicinity of

00:48.157 --> 00:56.969
McDonald Observatory and found that quite 
interesting. Where did you go to undergraduate

00:58.471 --> 00:59.813
school? Rice University. Why'd you pick Rice? 
Because it was inexpensive and it was a good

01:03.818 --> 01:06.822
school. Oh, that was when you still got a full 
scholarship? It was a full scholarship. What was

01:12.208 --> 01:12.829
your major? Physics. Did you take any astronomy 
courses in undergrad? Rice didn't have any

01:16.353 --> 01:19.977
astronomy courses when I was an undergrad. What 
year did you get your bachelor's? 1962. Why do I

01:24.522 --> 01:28.527
remember you at Yerkes Observatory about that 
period? Well, it was partly because I was

01:28.760 --> 01:34.809
interested in astronomy, but Rice didn't have any 
astronomy courses. And I found that a way to fill in

01:35.190 --> 01:41.439
my knowledge of astronomy was to work during the 
summers at observatories. So I made it a practice

01:41.459 --> 01:49.711
to find out about observatories that would accept 
undergraduates as summer assistants. And Yerkes

01:49.731 --> 01:52.375
had such a program, so that was where I went first. 
What year was that? 1959. Yeah, 59 sounds about

01:55.347 --> 01:58.912
right. I know that the way I first found out about 
this was when I was at McDonald Observatory one

01:58.972 --> 02:09.746
summer, and I talked to an astronomer from the 
University of Chicago. I believe it was Hiltner,

02:09.766 --> 02:14.712
perhaps, who told me about these programs. What 
were you doing at McDonald at that time, just

02:15.353 --> 02:19.038
visiting? Just visiting. Did you do any other 
observatories in any other summers? Yes, I worked

02:24.852 --> 02:29.698
at McDonald the summer of 60 and the summer of 61. 
And also I worked at Kitt Peak the summer of 62, I

02:29.878 --> 02:35.105
should add. Where did you go to grad school? 
University of California, Berkeley. Why did you

02:40.192 --> 02:40.913
pick that? Well, I was trying to find out which 
programs were good in physics for our graduate

02:42.715 --> 02:50.505
research. Then I decided that I was really more 
interested in astronomy than in physics. Since

02:55.785 --> 02:59.970
Berkeley had a good program in both, I thought that 
was a good choice. And when you began graduate

02:59.990 --> 03:02.613
school, what was your major? Was it physics? No, it 
was astronomy. It was astronomy, okay. What did

03:07.379 --> 03:11.404
you do for your Ph.D. thesis, and who was your 
advisor? I decided to go into theory, although I

03:13.227 --> 03:20.796
had a fair amount of experience in observing, but I 
decided that theory was... more interesting to me

03:21.400 --> 03:22.801
at the time. I started working with Louis Henier on 
stellar evolution problems. And he suggested

03:27.386 --> 03:38.718
that I work on the problem of thermal conduction by 
electrons in white dwarf matter, which was, at

03:27.386 --> 03:38.718
that time, a poorly understood process. And I was 
able to derive a new formalism for that, which was

03:40.059 --> 03:47.106
part of my dissertation. When did you get your PhD? 
1967. And where did you go then? I went to Caltech.

03:57.614 --> 04:01.401
Professor Henye had an arrangement. Well, he was 
good friends with William Fowler. And it was

04:05.148 --> 04:12.801
primarily through that interaction that I was 
able to get a postdoc position with Fowler's group

04:05.148 --> 04:12.801
at Caltech. How long did you stay there? A little 
less than two years. Okay. So that would be from?

04:21.159 --> 04:26.126
That was from 67 until the summer of 68. And what did 
you work on when you were there? Well, I produced a

04:29.150 --> 04:41.526
paper on thermal conduction by electrons in 
stars, which was basically an expansion of my

04:41.928 --> 04:47.635
dissertation work, which was also in 
collaboration with Martin Lampe, who did a

04:41.928 --> 04:47.635
complementary study. And we produced tables, 
which could be used in stellar evolution studies.

04:52.741 --> 04:55.705
I also first started working on planetary 
problems at that point. I started working on the

04:55.785 --> 04:58.188
interior of Jupiter while I was there. Why did you 
get interested in that? I discovered that the

05:01.872 --> 05:11.023
previous calculation of the thermal conduction 
coefficient in metallic hydrogen I've forgotten

05:11.982 --> 05:14.385
who did that calculation. It might come from 
Critchfield. Critchfield's calculation, I

05:16.387 --> 05:22.053
think he was at Los Alamos at the time, it was wrong 
by orders of magnitude. And I had just completed

05:22.093 --> 05:35.307
this new study, which I believed was applicable to 
metallic hydrogen as well, and used that to derive

05:22.093 --> 05:35.307
the implications for Jupiter based on the new 
infrared luminosity measurements of Jupiter,

05:35.877 --> 05:40.882
which were just becoming available due to Frank 
Lowe's work. What was the difference from what

05:41.163 --> 05:44.086
went before? Well, the big difference was that the 
thermal conductivity of metallic hydrogen was

05:44.807 --> 06:04.348
orders of magnitude lower than Critchfield had 
estimated, and it clearly indicated that the heat

05:44.807 --> 06:04.348
transport in Jupiter could not be carried by 
thermal conduction by electrons as had

05:44.807 --> 06:04.348
previously been estimated. and it implied that 
Jupiter had to have a conductive interior

06:04.565 --> 06:10.356
structure. Where did you go after your post-doc? 
Well, I had some possibilities from a couple of

06:13.322 --> 06:23.181
institutions, but Carlin Smith contacted me. 
indicated that the University of Texas would be

06:23.735 --> 06:27.779
able to hire me as an assistant professor. And I was 
very interested in that position, and I accepted.

06:30.362 --> 06:33.905
So I had my first academic job thanks to Harlan 
Smith. How long did you stay at Texas? Stayed there

06:38.470 --> 06:39.330
four years. I was there from 68 till the summer of 
72. And what were you doing during those four

06:43.735 --> 06:49.000
years? Well, I worked on a variety of problems. I, 
of course, taught undergraduate courses a fair

06:53.246 --> 06:57.910
amount. Yes, I taught some graduate courses as 
well, but I also did research on white dwarfs,

06:57.971 --> 07:11.585
oscillating white dwarfs, in collaboration with 
Brian Warner and Ed Nather, a work I found very

06:57.971 --> 07:11.585
stimulating. But I continued my planetary 
research. I worked on interior models of Jovian

07:14.568 --> 07:18.092
planets. And I first started doing some 
occultation research, because the University of

07:18.916 --> 07:26.606
Texas had a very strong stellar occultation 
program. Again, Warner and Nader's research and I

07:26.646 --> 07:40.203
suggested to them that their expertise might be 
profitably applied to the occultation of Beta

07:26.646 --> 07:40.203
Scorpii by Jupiter, which was in 1971. And that was 
a rather large project, which was, I think, fairly

07:40.383 --> 07:45.750
successful. Where did you go after Texas and why?

07:52.377 --> 08:09.374
In 1972, I was contacted by Gerard Kuiper, who was 
in the process of forming a new academic

07:52.377 --> 08:09.374
department to be essentially a part of the Lunar 
and Planetary Laboratory, which would be a new

07:52.377 --> 08:09.374
department of planetary sciences. At the 
University of Arizona. At the University of

08:11.376 --> 08:13.358
Arizona, yes. He was interested in hiring me as one 
of the initial members of this new academic

08:14.418 --> 08:21.065
department. And I found that offer to be extremely 
attractive. So that's why I went to the University

08:25.189 --> 08:27.952
of Arizona at that point. And how long did you stay 
at Arizona? Oh, I'm still there. Oh, that's OK.

08:31.615 --> 08:35.219
What department are you in, or institute? I can't 
keep them straight. It is the Department of

08:37.081 --> 08:38.923
Planetary Sciences. The Lunar and Planetary 
Laboratory was established in 1960 by Kuyper. And

08:45.333 --> 08:57.330
in 1972,

08:45.333 --> 08:57.330
he started recruiting the first faculty members 
for the Department of Planetary Sciences, which

08:45.333 --> 08:57.330
was to start basically a graduate program in 
planetary science. There was no mechanism for

08:58.332 --> 09:04.721
educating planetary scientists at the 
University of Arizona prior to that point. For

09:04.961 --> 09:14.074
example, Toby Owen, Dale Cruikshank, and Bill 
Hartman all received degrees from the University

09:04.961 --> 09:14.074
of Arizona. but they did not receive planetary 
science degrees because there was no such

09:14.678 --> 09:19.446
department at the time. Let me change the subject a 
little bit now since we've got the chronology.

09:29.301 --> 09:36.012
When you first got started, did you have the 
feeling that planetary work, since you've done

09:29.301 --> 09:36.012
both stellar and planetary work, that planetary 
astronomy or planetary science, if you want to

09:36.650 --> 09:45.884
call it that, was considered second or third rate 
by, quote, real, unquote, astronomers? Oh, yeah,

09:47.085 --> 09:50.571
I think that's definitely the case. I think that 
stellar astronomy, well, I shouldn't say

09:50.651 --> 10:06.454
stellar, I should say astrophysics in general, 
non-planetary astrophysics, is a much larger

09:50.651 --> 10:06.454
field with much greater depth And much greater 
distance. And much greater distance. And they

10:09.972 --> 10:18.320
do, in fact, tend to regard planetary research as a 
bit of a backwater. And I think the only reason I got

10:19.181 --> 10:26.808
into planetary research was because I found that 
the problems were very interesting. And the thing

10:27.249 --> 10:34.956
I found lacking in astrophysical work, which I 
found present in planetary research, is the

10:27.249 --> 10:34.956
precision of measurement which is available in 
planetary research theories, and observations

10:35.695 --> 10:46.069
can be compared on a much more precise level in 
general. Better than astrophysical accuracy or

10:46.530 --> 10:50.915
cosmological accuracy. Yes, although I should 
say that things like pulsars, of course, are

10:50.936 --> 10:55.622
counter-examples. So you think that planetary 
astronomy still look down a little bit now, even

10:57.625 --> 11:05.415
now?

11:06.931 --> 11:11.478
Well, I used to worry about that. I don't worry 
about that anymore. It simply isn't a matter of

11:13.822 --> 11:17.368
concern to me. I think it is a matter of concern 
primarily to planetary astronomers who are

11:17.428 --> 11:32.753
operating in a department of astronomy where 
they're frequently a minority member of a large

11:17.428 --> 11:32.753
astrophysical group. And they find it very 
difficult to get colleagues and to promote

11:33.155 --> 11:42.426
colleagues and to get resources that they think 
are commensurate with their efforts. And I hear

11:42.686 --> 11:45.209
this story over and over again. And that's one of 
the reasons why I think the Department of

11:45.249 --> 11:53.660
Planetary Sciences is such a good thing, because 
it enables us to essentially support each other.

11:53.900 --> 11:56.883
And it's been spectacularly successful, as I had 
hoped. How many departments of planetary science

11:57.124 --> 12:00.748
are there in this country? One. The University of 
Arizona is the only one, and I think if you look

12:02.142 --> 12:25.708
around now at the number of young people from that 
department who have received degrees from that

12:02.142 --> 12:25.708
department who are now beginning to appear on NASA 
panels in various positions of leadership,

12:02.142 --> 12:25.708
they're all rather young, of course, but they're 
certainly beginning to have an impact on the

12:02.142 --> 12:25.708
field, and I think there's no question that we've 
been successful. When did you first cross paths

12:26.609 --> 12:29.352
with NASH?

12:32.200 --> 12:40.168
Oh, well, it was probably at the, well, you mean in a 
formal sense, that is, being a member of a panel or

12:32.200 --> 12:40.168
something. Or getting money from them or 
something. Yes. Well, of course, when I was at

12:42.491 --> 12:51.240
Caltech, I talked to people like Bruce Murray and 
Peter Golrock and so on, who I presume were

12:42.491 --> 12:51.240
supported by NASA at the time, but I, of course, was 
not. The University of Texas, I was aware that

12:52.321 --> 12:59.288
projects like the 107-inch were being supported 
by Bill Brunk, and I first met Bill Brunk during one

12:59.892 --> 13:11.596
of his many visits to Texas at that time when he was 
still in the business of supporting

12:59.892 --> 13:11.596
observatories or building telescopes. As a 
result of some of my Jovian Planet research, I was

13:12.799 --> 13:19.673
asked to be a member of some of the early outer 
planets planning committees. I recall one that

13:25.644 --> 13:27.867
was chaired by Al Cameron. I don't remember its 
precise name. The name sort of changed from year to

13:29.370 --> 13:31.432
year.

13:34.597 --> 13:39.243
Who supported your early Jupiter interior 
research? Or, I mean, a theoretician, you didn't

13:39.444 --> 13:44.631
need telescopes, but you probably needed some 
computer money and so forth. I didn't receive any

13:45.877 --> 13:49.963
funding for the first couple of years. At Texas, it 
took me a while to get going getting research

13:50.103 --> 13:53.989
grants. Actually, I believe my first grant was 
from NSF, not from NASA. I don't recall whether I

14:00.158 --> 14:04.424
ever had a NASA grant at the University of Texas. 
It's possible that I didn't. But then at Arizona,

14:06.227 --> 14:08.290
is that different? At Arizona, yes. At Arizona, I 
was able to successfully get myself funded from

14:09.712 --> 14:15.360
Bill Bronx. Planetary Astronomy program, and in 
fact, I've had a Planetary Astronomy grant ever

14:15.931 --> 14:20.355
since. How do you think NASA headquarters has 
managed

14:21.457 --> 14:28.063
planetary research? This is a personal opinion of 
yours, but you think they've done it about right?

14:34.950 --> 14:36.352
Have they tried to micromanage? Do they know what 
you're doing?

14:40.796 --> 14:44.520
I've found my interactions with NASA to be 
basically fairly satisfactory. I find that the

14:46.844 --> 14:57.054
peer review system that has gradually spread 
throughout the system is probably as good as one

14:46.844 --> 14:57.054
could have. It has its defects, of course, but 
certainly the Planetary Astronomy Program,

14:57.835 --> 15:14.372
which is an example of how things have changed, 
initially was basically run by Bill Brunk, and the

14:57.835 --> 15:14.372
peer review process there was not totally clear to 
me. although I thought he managed to do an

15:15.061 --> 15:21.007
excellent job of spending his money. Of course, 
now there's a very involved peer review program,

15:22.668 --> 15:31.877
and I think it does about as well as one can expect it 
to do. Where do you think planetary astronomy

15:32.998 --> 15:41.726
would be today without the money that NSA has 
poured into it in the last 30 years? Oh, I think it

15:41.746 --> 15:42.807
would... it would unquestionably be at the same 
level that it was in in the 1950s. I think it would

15:49.536 --> 16:00.649
have only a few practitioners, probably most of 
which would be astrophysicists doing some

15:49.536 --> 16:00.649
planetary research as a sideline. We're at a 
Division for Planetary Sciences meeting of the

16:02.251 --> 16:06.837
American Astronomical Society in the course 26 
years ago, since this is the 25th anniversary,

16:07.913 --> 16:17.461
there was no DPS, and papers were given such as 
there were at American Astronomical Society

16:07.913 --> 16:17.461
meetings. The published papers were scattered 
through all sorts of journals, and in particular a

16:19.783 --> 16:27.950
lot of observatory publications. Now we have 
Icarus as an official journal and also the Journal

16:28.010 --> 16:34.075
for Geophysical Research, Planets. Do you think 
these developments have been good? bad,

16:37.951 --> 16:42.676
indifferent, inevitable, your opinion? You mean 
the fact that we now have our own journal? We're

16:46.420 --> 16:47.702
separate now, really. Yes. Well, I think 
planetary research is a rather disparate

16:49.063 --> 17:03.419
discipline, and what we do here in the DPS is very 
heavily oriented toward planetary astronomy,

16:49.063 --> 17:03.419
which, of course, is only one piece of planetary 
research. The field is still... rather divided

17:06.942 --> 17:12.090
across disciplines, and it's definitely an 
interdisciplinary field. There is a core of

17:12.290 --> 17:19.781
people who show up at DPS meetings, but they don't 
necessarily represent the full breadth of the

17:12.290 --> 17:19.781
field. Correspondingly, there are a lot of people 
who show up at AGU meetings who don't always show up

17:22.285 --> 17:27.773
at DPS meetings. So there's still a lot of division 
in the field. I think the DPS is a good thing, and it

17:35.393 --> 17:40.602
has certainly helped to unify the field. Well, 
you're an obvious example of the fact that

17:41.403 --> 17:50.459
planetary and non-planetary astronomers talk to 
each other, as you certainly talk to yourself. Do

17:50.479 --> 17:59.815
you think today that there's much crosstalk 
between stellar galactic and extragalactic

17:50.479 --> 17:59.815
astronomers and planetary ones in your 
experience? Well, there's possibly not as much as

18:00.368 --> 18:26.308
there should be, but I think there is definitely 
good communication, and I think the key to making

18:00.368 --> 18:26.308
that happen is to have either locations such as 
Tucson, where all of these people are within a

18:00.368 --> 18:26.308
small radius of each other, or else having 
interdisciplinary workshops or special

18:00.368 --> 18:26.308
meetings, topical meetings. One area that I'm 
particularly interested in is brown dwarf

18:26.896 --> 18:36.751
research, where there's an obvious interface 
between planetary people and astrophysicists.

18:37.933 --> 18:40.176
Do you think that planetary astronomy is a part of 
astronomy? It is, definitely. I think many of the

18:42.580 --> 18:54.878
same instrumental techniques are applicable in 
both fields and can benefit from some

18:42.580 --> 18:54.878
cross-fertilization there.

18:57.102 --> 19:03.048
Since I can't interview Gerard P. Kuiper, I'm 
asking everyone that knew him, what was he like? I

19:05.350 --> 19:08.133
have to say that I was not an intimate of Gerard 
Kuiper. Few were. Yes. I interacted with him

19:11.176 --> 19:24.730
extensively only during the period between the 
time that he recruited me at Austin and the time of

19:11.176 --> 19:24.730
his death. And I found him to be a curious mixture of 
being very advanced and perhaps even ahead of his

19:25.874 --> 19:42.858
time in certain concepts, certain planetary 
concepts, and other concepts were remarkably

19:25.874 --> 19:42.858
behind the times. He, I think, had a vision of what 
he wanted for planetary astronomy, and I think his

19:53.971 --> 20:03.043
The work that he was doing at the University of 
Arizona to set up the department and establish the

19:53.971 --> 20:03.043
Leonard Planetary Laboratory as a strong 
institution was certainly in that direction. So

20:03.103 --> 20:11.254
there's no question he was a visionary and both a 
great scientist and a great builder of

20:03.103 --> 20:11.254
institutions. In terms of his personal

20:13.236 --> 20:22.408
characteristics, he was somewhat of a 
monologuist. Well, Fred Whipple, who was one of

20:22.760 --> 20:36.383
the few people that could call him Gerard, said, 
and it's on tape, and I guess he was Kuiper's best

20:22.760 --> 20:36.383
friend, and Kuiper died in his arms, literally. 
And he said Gerard's problem was he couldn't get

20:37.304 --> 20:40.590
along with people. He didn't understand people. 
What do you think about that? I think that's a

20:45.035 --> 21:02.275
characteristic that you find among certain very 
energetic, nervous people, is that they feel

20:45.035 --> 21:02.275
compelled to fill the void, and he certainly did 
that. You have been at Arizona now for a while.

21:07.821 --> 21:11.025
After Kuiper left the Lunar and Planetary 
Laboratory, which you're not directly

21:11.630 --> 21:14.575
associated with now, but it's right there. I am 
directly associated. Oh, you are? That's right.

21:16.778 --> 21:17.599
I'm sorry. I'm confusing you with somebody else, 
Mike in particular. But anyway, when Kuiper left,

21:23.068 --> 21:28.877
then who took over? Charlie Sonnet, right? Chuck 
Sonnet. Chuck Sonnet. Uh-huh, yeah. And the

21:33.331 --> 21:36.096
laboratory changed directions. Is that true or 
not? That's true. What direction did it go to, and

21:39.201 --> 21:43.388
was that good or bad?

21:46.133 --> 21:57.752
The idea that we all had about the department and 
the laboratory was that if it was to succeed, it had

21:46.133 --> 21:57.752
to be encompassing of the, at least not perhaps not 
all, but many of the important areas of planetary

21:58.154 --> 22:09.524
science, which would include not only planetary 
astronomy, but disciplines such as planetary

21:58.154 --> 22:09.524
geophysics and planetary geochemistry. And 
there already were some planetary geologists

22:09.544 --> 22:15.750
there, like Bob Strom, for example. And so it was 
agreed among those of us who were the charter

22:16.891 --> 22:27.520
members of the department that there should be an 
effort made to recruit people who were not

22:16.891 --> 22:27.520
planetary astronomers, And I believe that Kuyper 
was unhappy about some of these decisions. And I

22:35.943 --> 22:49.497
know some of the old-time astronomers who were 
there at LPL certainly were, because they felt

22:35.943 --> 22:49.497
that their discipline, which was basically the 
basis of LPL's reputation, was being slighted by

22:35.943 --> 22:49.497
these new hires. I think it was the correct 
decision. I think it made the place very

22:51.639 --> 22:56.764
attractive to students.

22:58.077 --> 23:04.389
The people that were at it were, without 
exception, very good people who went on to do

22:58.077 --> 23:04.389
rather distinguished research. How long did 
SONNET last? Oh, okay. You want to know about the

23:10.682 --> 23:12.185
big fight? Yeah, supernova explosion. The big 
fight, yeah. Okay. Well, I have to be a little

23:17.602 --> 23:22.207
careful what I say here because many of the 
principals are still around. Well, that's like

23:22.428 --> 23:27.334
trying to find out just exactly who was behind 
getting Kuiper fired at Yerkes. Yes. Well, let me

23:28.074 --> 23:41.230
just say that I'll give you my own opinion about the 
situation, which is that I believe that planetary

23:28.074 --> 23:41.230
astronomy at the University of Arizona was— 
greatly strengthened by the fact that it had its

23:42.087 --> 23:49.877
own telescopes, which the Lunar and Planetary 
Laboratory controlled. These were, of course,

23:50.938 --> 23:54.763
not first-ranked telescopes by astrophysical 
standards. The largest of them was the

23:55.124 --> 24:05.597
154-centimeter

23:55.124 --> 24:05.597
telescope, which was built by Kuiper with Bill 
Brunk's money in the Catalina Mountains. The rest

24:06.792 --> 24:20.624
of the other telescopes were lesser instruments 
of rather poor quality, but still were controlled

24:06.792 --> 24:20.624
by the laboratory, all of these telescopes being 
in the Catalina Mountains. The principal issue of

24:20.644 --> 24:35.517
the fight was that it was believed by Stewart 
Observatory that all telescopes should be

24:20.644 --> 24:35.517
operated by Stewart Observatory in the interests 
of efficiency and funding possibilities from NSF

24:20.644 --> 24:35.517
and other organizations. And this proposal. And 
Bart Bach was the director then, right? No, Ray

24:42.214 --> 24:45.118
Wyman was the director. Although Bart Bach was 
still around, of course. Oh, that's right. After

24:48.862 --> 25:04.542
Kuyper's death, Sonnet was faced with the 
decision of whether to do as the Stewart

24:48.862 --> 25:04.542
Observatory astronomer suggested, or whether he 
should continue as a non-astronomer with the

24:48.862 --> 25:04.542
maintenance in support of these telescopes and 
the Catalinas. At the time, many of the

25:09.990 --> 25:29.093
observational astronomers in LPL were opposed to 
having SONNET operate

25:09.990 --> 25:29.093
these telescopes, because they felt that as a 
non-astronomer he was not fully supportive of

25:09.990 --> 25:29.093
their programs. Furthermore, the fact that 
non-astronomers were being hired was a prime

25:29.273 --> 25:35.220
irritant. And so the fight essentially was 
between the new guard, which I was a member even

25:36.010 --> 25:51.593
though I was hired by Kuiper, and the old guard over 
the fate of the telescopes and over recruiting

25:36.010 --> 25:51.593
policies. And that struggle led to two outcomes. 
One was Chuck's on its resignation. What year was

25:59.965 --> 26:00.586
that? Do you remember? It was in 1977. The result of 
his resignation was that the telescopes were, in

26:04.428 --> 26:11.617
fact, turned over to Stewart Observatory. And I 
believe that this is a development which has had

26:12.819 --> 26:20.789
both positive and negative results. The 
telescopes are still fully available to

26:21.249 --> 26:26.876
planetary astronomers and are, as far as I can 
tell, well maintained. But at the same time, the

26:28.418 --> 26:31.482
fact that the department does not have These 
telescopes that it has to keep busy with planetary

26:31.934 --> 26:46.769
research has, in my view, led to a subtle but very 
important pressure to not hire planetary

26:31.934 --> 26:46.769
astronomers with the same priority as it might 
have had in the past. So I'm very concerned about

26:46.789 --> 26:55.318
the fact that this may lead to an eventual decline 
in the field that we're very strong in. Who took

26:55.338 --> 26:55.999
over? Who was the department head? after Kuyper 
died. I assume he was the first department head.

27:03.381 --> 27:07.685
Kuyper was actually, I don't think he was the first 
department head. The department did not come into

27:07.705 --> 27:10.888
existence. It was not chartered by the Board of 
Regents until Kuyper, I believe, had already

27:11.349 --> 27:23.160
resigned as director of LPL. Chuck Sonnet was the 
first head of of the Planetary Sciences

27:26.761 --> 27:31.186
Department, and he was the second director of LPL. 
Sonnet resigned, as I said, in 1977, and the

27:32.268 --> 27:49.508
laboratory asked me to become director as a 
compromise in the sense that I was marginally

27:32.268 --> 27:49.508
acceptable to both camps. So I was a reluctant 
director of the Lunar and Planetary Laboratory

27:49.528 --> 27:56.076
and head of Planetary Sciences for four years 
during this transitional period in which the

27:56.275 --> 28:08.707
department was adjusting to the loss of the 
telescopes and defining itself further. Who took

28:08.747 --> 28:12.390
over after you managed to get out? I suggested 
Laurel Wilkening as my successor because I felt

28:13.891 --> 28:23.020
that she would be acceptable also to the various 
factions in the laboratory, and that proved to be

28:13.891 --> 28:23.020
the case. However, she didn't stay in as director 
very long. I think it was only about a year and a

28:27.190 --> 28:29.093
half. It took over after her. Gene Levy, who is the 
current director. In fact, Levy has been in, I

28:34.661 --> 28:39.648
think, probably about as long as Kuyper by now, or 
getting pretty close to it. It was revolving.

28:40.790 --> 28:43.654
Dora's there for a while, for a little bit. Well, it 
was revolving in the sense that there was some

28:43.734 --> 28:51.705
rapid change of leadership, but it was not an 
unstable situation. These were orderly

28:52.186 --> 28:55.611
transitions. Let me change the subject. From your 
personal viewpoint, what does the public think of

28:59.886 --> 29:04.012
when you tell them you're an astronomer? What's 
the reaction? Do they think it's good? Do they

29:06.996 --> 29:09.260
think you're a leech or what? Well, it's 
interesting, since you're asking me because I'm

29:10.281 --> 29:13.986
at the University of Arizona. And as you are 
probably aware, there's been this long, bitter

29:14.307 --> 29:20.296
struggle over Mount Graham in Arizona. And I find 
that in many cases, people on the street or people

29:27.181 --> 29:38.413
that I meet in various contexts express their 
annoyance at the way the Mount Graham development

29:27.181 --> 29:38.413
has been handled and their annoyance at 
astronomy. And I assure them, and this is perhaps

29:39.454 --> 29:49.185
the only good thing about the loss of the 
telescopes, I can assure them that I have nothing

29:39.454 --> 29:49.185
whatever to do with this, that it's being handled 
out of Stewart Observatory. And I think that what

29:50.507 --> 29:53.610
we have to bear in mind is that as astronomers we 
don't produce anything that's of palpable

29:54.367 --> 30:06.542
economic value, and that we have to make sure that 
what we do does not alienate the public. And the

30:07.563 --> 30:23.563
benefits that they accrue I think are apparent, 
but they can be overweighed by things that we do

30:07.563 --> 30:23.563
that portray arrogance or lack of concern about 
what the public thinks about what we're doing.

30:25.940 --> 30:29.205
What's the best piece of work you've done? Well, 
I'm pretty proud of the work that I did on Jupiter

30:32.010 --> 30:36.176
that I mentioned. Some

30:36.217 --> 30:43.328
of the occultation research that I've carried out 
I'm rather proud of. We were among the groups which

30:44.189 --> 30:52.082
first detected the Neptunian ring arcs. and 
identified them for what they were, and were able

30:53.058 --> 31:17.532
to deliver this information prior to the Voyager 
encounter with Neptune, which I think was

30:53.058 --> 31:17.532
sufficiently influential that it enabled 
Carolyn Porco, for example, to convince the

30:53.058 --> 31:17.532
Voyager 2 team to point the cameras in the right 
place to detect these ring arcs. One little thing I

31:17.852 --> 31:20.736
think that it's probably worth mentioning 
connection with Gerard Kuiper is that in 1981,

31:21.205 --> 31:35.666
Harold Reitzema, Dave Tholen, Larry Lebowski, 
and I observed using the former LPL telescopes in

31:21.205 --> 31:35.666
the Catalinas. This was, of course, after the 
telescopes had been turned over to Stuart, but we

31:36.167 --> 31:42.476
were using Kuiper's telescope. Harold Reitzema 
and I were on the 61-inch And we detected a third

31:45.927 --> 31:55.855
Neptunian ring, which is now called, not ring, 
satellite, which was subsequently named

31:45.927 --> 31:55.855
Larissa. And I felt a great satisfaction in 
finding a new satellite of Neptune. Of course,

32:01.860 --> 32:04.903
Kuiper discovered Nereid, the second satellite. 
But I felt great satisfaction in detecting this

32:05.423 --> 32:09.847
new satellite with Kuiper's telescope. Do you 
ever have any dead ends, misfires, things you wish

32:10.388 --> 32:15.512
you would not have gotten into? Well, I certainly 
didn't enjoy being head of the department and

32:16.977 --> 32:25.888
director of Lunar and Planetary Laboratory, and I 
often wonder what would have happened if I'd

32:16.977 --> 32:25.888
turned that down. Probably nothing bad would have 
happened to me. I'm not sure about the laboratory.

32:33.277 --> 32:34.879
Well, you are in this situation. Somebody that 
looks pretty sharp comes up and says, gee, I want to

32:34.979 --> 32:40.926
be a planetary astronomer right now. We're 
obviously at the start of another big funding

32:41.952 --> 32:47.500
crunch like happened in 73 and 81. What do you tell 
the students? Yes, no, or what? I think students

32:53.708 --> 32:57.414
have to have a pretty tough attitude these days. 
The analogy that unfortunately comes to mind is

32:57.474 --> 33:02.701
baby tortoises. They hatch out at a great rate, but 
most of them perish, and that may be the situation

33:04.764 --> 33:11.453
we're in right now with tortoises. planetary 
scientists and also with astronomers, only the

33:12.395 --> 33:23.108
very best are going to succeed and survive in the 
long term doing what they currently plan to do.

33:23.769 --> 33:29.957
Well, I guess come to think of it, it's just like 
astronomy in general before the space age, before

33:23.769 --> 33:29.957
Sputnik. I mean, you know, there just aren't a 
whole lot of jobs.

33:36.365 --> 33:40.410
None of the principles are alive, I believe, so I 
just have to ask people. At the turn of the century,

33:41.048 --> 33:45.934
planetary astronomy was a respectable part of 
astronomy. Henry Norris Russell did work on the

33:45.954 --> 33:49.539
Venus atmosphere. By the end of World War II, it was 
basically dead. What killed it, or who killed it? I

33:59.591 --> 34:02.215
don't think it was anybody's decision to kill it. I 
don't think there was an attempt to do that by

34:02.575 --> 34:08.122
anybody. I think that it was... the lack of tools 
for precise

34:11.069 --> 34:29.250
work, and also the lack of tools for interesting 
new discoveries, which basically sent the field

34:11.069 --> 34:29.250
into a period of suspended animation for all that 
period of time. Well, the point was, of course,

34:29.270 --> 34:32.254
there was essentially no infrared. And that's 
where the spectral features are of interest, most

34:32.274 --> 34:35.097
of them. And photometry was not very good. Well, 
radar astronomy. Radio, planetary radio

34:41.444 --> 34:45.469
astronomy, one can go on and on. But basically, the 
very limited spectrum and the very limited

34:45.770 --> 35:02.292
resolution which was available were the things 
that made planetary astronomy not able to

34:45.770 --> 35:02.292
progress very well. Gerard de Vaucouleur had an 
emphatic two-word answer to that question.

35:05.717 --> 35:06.698
Percival Lowell. Do you think that had an effect as 
well? You mean a negative influence on planetary

35:12.005 --> 35:16.190
astronomy? No, I don't think so. I think Percival 
Lowell deserves a lot of credit. I mean, after all,

35:20.496 --> 35:26.324
the planet Pluto was discovered as a result of his 
investment of time and money. Do you think that the

35:28.186 --> 35:41.083
fact that we haven't been able to find any evidence 
of life anywhere in the solar system so far, in

35:28.186 --> 35:41.083
particular on Mars, has had a depressing effect on 
public interest and funding? I think as I study the

35:43.223 --> 36:01.808
field more and as I learn more about modern 
concepts of chaos and applications of that theory

35:43.223 --> 36:01.808
to biology and to planetary systems, the more I 
realize that the borderline between life and

35:43.223 --> 36:01.808
non-life is very fuzzy indeed. And if you look 
through the solar system, you'll find many

36:03.090 --> 36:12.403
examples of survival of the fittest, for example, 
as well as systems which are in very unlikely

36:13.075 --> 36:18.744
states, highly organized, unlikely states. And I 
think that we have to be careful about what we mean

36:19.966 --> 36:23.472
by life. And I think it's not at all excluded that 
we'll discover life in some fashion in the solar

36:24.874 --> 36:32.687
system. Just looking at, I mean, we've learned a 
lot about the planets and satellites and so forth

36:34.304 --> 36:40.651
in the last 30 years. What do you think is the most 
important thing? And I'll give you my particular

36:42.933 --> 36:49.641
one, just to give you an example, is that we used to 
think you had gas giants and then rocks. And now

36:50.662 --> 36:57.469
we've found there's this whole other kind of 
planet, namely the icy ones, that no one ever

36:50.662 --> 36:57.469
thought of before. That's my candidate. What's 
yours? Most important discovery in planetary

37:04.122 --> 37:08.106
science. Or change of thinking, either one or 
another one. I think the most important change in

37:15.873 --> 37:29.927
thinking that we have, in my view, which I think is 
mirrored also in astrophysics, is the discovery

37:30.852 --> 37:42.928
that we're in a dynamic situation, that we live in a 
system which is evolving on all kinds of time

37:30.852 --> 37:42.928
scales and spatial scales in a very complex 
manner. And it's not a quiescent clockwork system

37:43.429 --> 37:51.499
which is frozen into some sort of state, which it's 
been in for eons. So it's not the Laplace-Lagrange

37:51.860 --> 37:55.905
universe that once was. That's right.

38:00.704 --> 38:06.570
There's been a lot of attention lately to things 
like making planetary astronomy practical. A lot

38:06.851 --> 38:14.138
of publicity of killer asteroids and comets, the 
ozone layer depletion, global warming. Do you

38:15.560 --> 38:21.106
think that's been overdone, or do you think that 
it's good science, and so what if it's popular?

38:21.246 --> 38:22.327
Let's get the money and work on it. My visceral 
reaction is that it's kind of nauseating. I don't

38:28.013 --> 38:30.576
like self-serving hype. I think there's a lot of 
that, and I think the so-called killer asteroid

38:31.400 --> 38:40.031
concept is definitely in that category. I spend a 
lot of time on this subject with my undergraduate

38:40.912 --> 38:53.728
classes because it inevitably comes up, and what I 
tell them is that one's risks of being killed

38:54.620 --> 39:11.368
within the next year, say, can be calculated 
quantitatively from a variety of threats, and

38:54.620 --> 39:11.368
certainly the biggest threat is a drunk driver, 
and killer asteroids are way down the list, as are

38:54.620 --> 39:11.368
many of the other threats that you've mentioned.

39:15.675 --> 39:20.543
Science in general has a bad name, you know, make 
nuclear weapons and everything, and for some

39:20.725 --> 39:25.370
reason astronomers, including planetary 
astronomers, seem to have escaped that.

39:28.132 --> 39:29.694
Do you think that's true? Well, they might have 
escaped that prior to Mount Graham. I think that

39:33.177 --> 39:47.151
problems like Mount Graham unfortunately tend to 
lump us in the same category as the other

39:33.177 --> 39:47.151
scientific efforts which are considered to be bad 
for humanity.

39:49.734 --> 39:50.715
But I think Science doesn't have any particular 
moral orientation, and it can be applied in a

39:51.742 --> 39:58.869
variety of ways, some of which are beneficial and 
some aren't. Well, in general, but also in

39:59.310 --> 40:17.648
particular on the Mount Graham issue, because 
you're in the crossfire whether you're actually

39:59.310 --> 40:17.648
part of it or not, do you think astronomers in 
general and planetary scientists in particular

39:59.310 --> 40:17.648
have done as good a job as they could have in selling 
themselves to the public? As I say, we have to bear

40:19.923 --> 40:32.720
in mind that what we produce is of no direct benefit 
to humanity in the sense that it does not have

40:19.923 --> 40:32.720
obvious economic value. I think attempts to link 
it to obvious economic value are not appropriate.

40:38.187 --> 40:47.179
I think that what we have successfully done, what 
we should continue to do, is to amaze, thrill,

40:38.187 --> 40:47.179
inspire people the public with our discoveries 
and as long as we do a good job of that i think we're

40:47.497 --> 41:11.749
okay you think planetary science is kind of mined 
out i mean you think all the big things have been

40:47.497 --> 41:11.749
found all the spectacular stuff or no no not at all i 
think what's the direction we're moving in is that

40:47.497 --> 41:11.749
planetary science is moving in the direction of 
planetary geophysics uh within c2 measurements

41:12.185 --> 41:29.543
or with precise remote measurements in various 
ways, we were able to achieve precision of

41:12.185 --> 41:29.543
measurement and wealth of detail of measurement 
which are comparable to those which are now

41:12.185 --> 41:29.543
available to geophysicists. So what we have 
basically is an array of Earths, of objects which

41:29.563 --> 41:40.774
are as complex and about which we'll have the same 
sort of detailed knowledge that we have about the

41:29.563 --> 41:40.774
Earth. And of course, there are scores of such 
objects. So I think we're going to enter a whole new

41:45.596 --> 41:48.939
era in the next century. Here's a leading 
question. But were you surprised when it became

41:51.021 --> 42:03.353
obvious that little icy satellites of other 
planets really had a history, and they just didn't

41:51.021 --> 42:03.353
form and sit there forever? Were you surprised at 
that? No. I mean, this is part of what I mentioned

42:09.897 --> 42:23.818
before, which is, I think, that we have now learned 
that the solar system is a system which is evolving

42:09.897 --> 42:23.818
in a very complex manner, even at present. And 
certainly, some of the outer planet satellites

42:24.319 --> 42:30.568
are much more interesting than the moon. The moon 
turns out to be a rather dull place in comparison,

42:31.529 --> 42:39.381
but in my view, it's still a very interesting place 
as well.

42:40.205 --> 42:43.528
I'd say keep in touch with reality by having to 
teach undergrads. Well,

42:45.810 --> 42:53.857
is enrollment up, down, interest up, down over the 
last 10 or 20 years? Or what's the situation at

42:53.937 --> 42:56.399
Arizona, at least? I find that we get a lot of 
interest from undergraduates. They're not as

43:01.144 --> 43:05.347
well prepared in many cases as one would like. But I 
think interest is as high as ever.

43:11.373 --> 43:12.134
One more thing. My personal opinion is that 
planetary astronomy starts with the Venus

43:13.857 --> 43:30.079
tablets from the dynasty of Hammurabi when they 
give observations of when Venus was first visible

43:13.857 --> 43:30.079
in the west after sunset and last visible in the 
east before sunrise and so forth. There are other

43:31.622 --> 43:35.507
people that claim that planetary astronomy only 
began when Galileo first pointed his telescope

43:35.757 --> 43:41.464
at, say, Jupiter and Venus. When do you think 
planetary astronomy began? Planetary astronomy

43:45.009 --> 43:47.993
was the start of astronomy. The first things that 
were understood in any sense were the planets. And

43:52.839 --> 43:58.987
so that dates back basically to the first naked eye 
observations of moving objects in the sky, which

43:52.839 --> 43:58.987
were planets. So definitely I agree with you.
