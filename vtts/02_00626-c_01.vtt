WEBVTT

00:06.072 --> 00:10.117
So each time we turn the tape over, then we have that 
15-second protective delay.

00:13.981 --> 00:17.485
Now, first, Professor Fleming, I'd like to know 
what interested you in the sea. Why did you choose

00:17.625 --> 00:20.148
the sea as a profession? Well, I was studying as a 
chemist at the University of British Columbia and

00:21.710 --> 00:35.185
completed my bachelor's degree in 1929 and stayed 
on at the the University of British Columbia, take

00:35.789 --> 00:41.657
a master's degree in chemistry. And this, as you 
should recognize, was the beginning of the

00:42.478 --> 00:48.886
Depression. And it was quite obvious to me that 
there were more chemists than were going to be

00:48.906 --> 01:03.805
needed, and that it was particularly difficult to 
obtain any sort of graduate degree. student

01:04.257 --> 01:15.471
support in chemistry, and I had become somewhat 
bored with the field of chemistry and thought I'd

01:04.257 --> 01:15.471
better seek some other area. And I'd grown up right 
by the water, and many of my friends were

01:16.452 --> 01:29.247
essentially marine biologists, and I happened to 
hear about this field called oceanography, and it

01:16.452 --> 01:29.247
seemed very intriguing. So I was able to obtain a 
research assistantship at Scripps Institution,

01:32.590 --> 01:39.917
Bahia, California, in 1931, down there.

01:42.680 --> 01:44.742
Had you not been to Scripps before you acquired it? 
No. In those days, one didn't travel very much, and

01:45.703 --> 01:54.292
it was a major expedition to get to Southern 
California. Actually, I went down by ship. And did

02:00.367 --> 02:04.793
you know with whom you wished to work at Scripps 
when you went? Not really. I expected to work in

02:06.436 --> 02:28.348
chemistry, and at that time the chemist at Scripps 
was Eric Moberg, and I did essentially work with

02:06.436 --> 02:28.348
him for a number of years, although I moved out of 
the field of chemical oceanography after a few

02:06.436 --> 02:28.348
years. game involved in sort of descriptive 
physical oceanography. Now, how long were you at

02:35.354 --> 02:36.636
Scripps? Well, I was there as a graduate student 
for four years, and I completed my Ph.D. in 1935,

02:37.176 --> 02:58.099
and then was kept on in sort of research capacity 
for one year just as an assistant, and then they In

02:58.670 --> 03:16.309
1936, I was appointed as an instructor on the 
faculty at Scripps, and this was at the time that

02:58.670 --> 03:16.309
Harold Fairgroup had just been appointed and came 
in as the director, which he did in September of

02:58.670 --> 03:16.309
1936. When did you first acquire the idea of the 
textbook that became the standard in the field?

03:25.417 --> 03:35.189
more or less by accident, as a lot of these things 
do, that Scripps had never had any particular

03:25.417 --> 03:35.189
program in sort of education. And when Harold 
Spherdrup came as the director, he felt that we

03:36.210 --> 03:51.289
ought to be doing more in this line, and he started 
some summer courses in in oceanography, sort of a

03:51.505 --> 04:20.871
general survey course, and he and Martin Johnson 
and I were the principal lecturers, and the

03:51.505 --> 04:20.871
Prentice Hall Publishing Company apparently 
heard about this through their grapevine and came

03:51.505 --> 04:20.871
down and suggested that we write down our lecture 
notes, and being all innocent, we said yes, we

03:51.505 --> 04:20.871
would be willing to do so. And it was out of this 
summer course in oceanography that the volume on

04:21.188 --> 04:31.007
the oceans finally appeared. It took us about 
three years to write it, and it was finished in

04:31.768 --> 04:36.678
1942. What sort of work were you doing at Scripps 
while you were there? Oh, I went down. Do you mean as

04:43.244 --> 04:45.306
a graduate student? As a graduate student and then 
always. I was sort of Jack of all trades and have

04:47.008 --> 04:54.495
been, I think, all my career. But my principal 
interest was originally in some sort of chemical

04:55.356 --> 05:12.913
work, and I did some work on the calcium carbonate 
problem, something on nutrients. and used to

05:13.619 --> 05:26.611
participate

05:13.619 --> 05:26.611
in the very limited sort of seagoing program we had 
in those days. And then in 1932, I was given a leave,

05:27.572 --> 05:42.225
in a sense, and went up to Berkeley, to the 
University of California, to get a little bit more

05:43.083 --> 05:50.534
coursework and to prepare for my general 
examinations. And when I came back to Scripps from

05:50.735 --> 06:11.166
there, early in 1933,

05:50.735 --> 06:11.166
I was told that the Navy wanted somebody to go down 
to Central America to carry out some

05:50.735 --> 06:11.166
oceanographic work on board one of the naval 
vessels. I went down and joined the USS Hannibal,

06:11.787 --> 06:36.100
which was a vessel used by the then Navy 
Hydrographic Office, and spent several months

06:11.787 --> 06:36.100
down off the west coast of Panama and Costa Rica 
doing just sort of the field routine which had

06:11.787 --> 06:36.100
already been sort of planned. And when I got back to 
La Jolla, they said, well, why don't you write up

06:40.323 --> 06:45.690
the results? And so this actually turned out to be 
my doctoral thesis and got me into sort of

06:45.931 --> 06:53.841
descriptive physical oceanography. That was 
what I was interested in, is when did you get this

06:54.442 --> 06:59.649
first descriptive oceanography that you were in 
in the early 30s? And you stayed with that, though,

07:00.591 --> 07:02.473
for two or three years. I think of you more there 
than as a chemical oceanographer. Oh, yes. I

07:06.318 --> 07:09.823
haven't really done any chemical oceanography. 
since that time, really, because as

07:10.276 --> 07:38.325
soon as I had finished up my thesis on this 
particular material, why, Dr. Sverdrup had

07:10.276 --> 07:38.325
arrived and

07:10.276 --> 07:38.325
was very anxious to start a more kind of systematic 
program of field work. And this developed in a sort

07:40.060 --> 08:09.156
of indirect way, as many of these enterprises did, 
in that the California Fish and Game Commission

07:40.060 --> 08:09.156
was at that time concerned with the problem of the 
distribution and abundance of California

07:40.060 --> 08:09.156
sardines and wanted to do some oceanographic 
work. made available to Scripps the use of a small

08:10.115 --> 08:19.746
patrol vessel called the Bluefin. And in the early 
spring, and I think it extended up into the summer

08:20.527 --> 08:37.928
of 1937, we got our first systematic series of 
observations off the Southern California coast.

08:38.785 --> 08:48.697
And this continued and so on, so we became very much 
involved in essentially the regional

08:38.785 --> 08:48.697
oceanography off the coast of California. Who 
worked in the sardine fisheries activities with

08:49.198 --> 08:52.662
you? Well, we just did a

08:53.063 --> 09:07.240
certain amount of work on conventional physical 
oceanography.

09:07.726 --> 09:11.129
a little bit of chemistry and some work on the 
plankton. We never became at that time directly

09:12.391 --> 09:35.995
involved in any of the fish studies, but the 
federal government had also become very much

09:12.391 --> 09:35.995
involved in the problem, and the two people that we 
dealt with a good deal were Alton B. Setty and

09:12.391 --> 09:35.995
Lionel Walford, both of what was then, I think, the 
Bureau of Commercial Fisheries, although they

09:36.312 --> 09:41.259
changed their names often. I'm not quite sure of 
this one. But they were very much involved in the

09:44.684 --> 09:52.254
fisheries aspect and also the state fisheries. 
And the man in the state fisheries with whom we work

09:52.354 --> 10:02.809
very closely now at USC is Richard B. Tibby. run 
across, and he came down after a year or two and

10:03.295 --> 10:18.575
actually finished his PhD at Scripps on the 
oceanography of the California coast. Now, this

10:18.595 --> 10:25.644
is really the first time the Pacific coast is being 
mapped, is when you're mapping it now in these

10:18.595 --> 10:25.644
several years. Were you surprised about certain 
things? Well, I think it's Yes and no.

10:38.953 --> 10:50.451
Because of the interest in the sardine problem, 
the region was more or less prescribed for us. And

10:50.831 --> 10:59.425
yet within that area, which extended off the 
coast, I imagine about a couple of hundred miles,

11:00.367 --> 11:18.005
They wanted considerable detail, so I think one of 
the things that was rather original was the fact

11:00.367 --> 11:18.005
that we made repeated studies on a fairly closely 
spaced network of stations. This showed details

11:18.085 --> 11:27.555
that were essentially unanticipated, 
certainly.

11:27.772 --> 11:39.407
Professor Sverdrup in particular became very 
interested in the role of upwelling as it affected

11:27.772 --> 11:39.407
these waters to the south of Point Conception. And 
I think we had some of the first evidence on the

11:39.427 --> 11:51.383
existence of eddies in the area that these sort of 
features had not been identified before.

11:54.940 --> 11:58.908
Who was joining you in Scripps between, let's say, 
35 on? You seem to have a whole series of people come

11:58.928 --> 12:02.976
in at Scripps about this time who go on. Well, the 
biggest change has occurred,

12:03.838 --> 12:13.658
I feel, in about 1920. which was just about the time 
I went there as a graduate student, and that Dr.

12:14.667 --> 12:42.750
Vaughn, who was the director, had been able to get 
some additional funds, and he had a really very

12:14.667 --> 12:42.750
imaginative sort of view of what ought to be done at 
that time, and he added two faculty people, and

12:43.810 --> 12:54.601
Claude Zobel in microbiology, and Dennis Fox 
essentially in physiology and biochemistry.

12:56.082 --> 13:02.028
This represented a major kind of shift in what was 
going on at Scripps. In the physical area and the

13:02.288 --> 13:11.117
field work where There were no sort of major 
additions to the

13:11.553 --> 13:31.996
faculty and staff, except during these years we 
had considerable support from people who were

13:11.553 --> 13:31.996
provided to the institution under the WPA, the 
Works Progress Administration. One of the

13:33.318 --> 13:39.805
curious things is that the illustrations in my 
thesis were all drawn by man whose background had

13:40.730 --> 13:55.825
been in architecture and was being supported on 
these federal funds, and all my graphs looked like

13:40.730 --> 13:55.825
architectural drawings. But we had considerable 
staff support, technician support in those days

13:55.845 --> 14:07.277
from people who were assigned to scripts under the 
WPA program. Gene LaFond was one person who worked

14:08.118 --> 14:17.127
very closely with this program, with and I. And 
that was about it. Things weren't quite as large as

14:20.290 --> 14:22.752
they are today. Did you find much exchange among 
the faculty in that time? In other words, were you

14:26.315 --> 14:34.023
able to come to, let's say, people like Martin 
Johnson and talk about your problems, many

14:26.315 --> 14:34.023
meetings, this sort of thing? Not particularly. 
As far as the kind of research work was concerned,

14:38.138 --> 14:57.306
everybody did their own particular job, but as I 
mentioned a few minutes ago, we did collect

14:38.138 --> 14:57.306
plankton samples on these cruises. The 
phytoplankton were examined by Mr. Allen and His

15:05.645 --> 15:18.282
associate, Easter Kopp, and Mark Johnson and his 
assistants and students did the work on the

15:05.645 --> 15:18.282
zooplankton. So, yes, and the group was small 
enough that you did sort of see everybody

15:18.542 --> 15:28.655
frequently, and there was a good deal of exchange. 
But it was not a, it didn't by any means involve all

15:29.336 --> 15:34.723
of the activities that at Scripps or all the 
faculty.

15:41.135 --> 15:42.837
When does Roger Revell get to Scripps? Well, he 
arrived a month or two after I did in the summer of

15:42.977 --> 16:00.036
1931 and came down to work on the sediment samples 
that had been collected on the cruise of the

16:00.337 --> 16:28.993
non-magnetic vessel Carnegie during I think it 
was 1928-29

16:00.337 --> 16:28.993
and he was to carry out this examination

16:00.337 --> 16:28.993
of the material under the direction of Dr. Vaughan 
but he also got interested in a number of things and

16:00.337 --> 16:28.993
we worked together on several problems, one of 
them concerning the solubility of calcium

16:29.513 --> 16:40.004
carbonate and the precipitation of calcium 
carbonate in seawater. And he also used to

16:41.105 --> 16:52.376
participate in some of these cruises that we made 
before the sardine investigations began in 1937.

16:52.536 --> 16:59.183
In fact, he and I used to take the research vessel 
out most of the time when acted as captain and

16:59.585 --> 17:03.251
deckhands. We had only a one-man crew who was the 
engineer on the small vessel that was available.

17:12.405 --> 17:17.814
It's been suggested to me recently that one of the 
problems with the modern oceanographers is they

17:12.405 --> 17:17.814
don't get their feet wet, so to speak. They don't 
spend enough time on vessels. Would you agree with

17:19.397 --> 17:20.118
that? Well, yes and no. I think the

17:27.597 --> 17:47.445
character of the work at sea has changed as the 
vessels have become much larger and as the

17:27.597 --> 17:47.445
equipment has become much more complex, and that 
the vessel we had and the the times I'm talking

17:47.763 --> 18:14.175
about prior to the sardine surveys was just called 
the scripts and she was a 55 foot trawler type

17:47.763 --> 18:14.175
vessel with a one man permanent crew and so the 
graduate students in general used to take out and

17:47.763 --> 18:14.175
run the ship essentially navigate as necessary do 
all of the sampling do all of the sort of deckhand

18:14.999 --> 18:24.251
functions, as well as work on the samples after 
they were back in the laboratory. Now it's more

18:24.271 --> 18:38.029
like, I have the feeling, as a graduate student 
goes out, it's more or less like going on an ocean

18:24.271 --> 18:38.029
liner, that they're just, in a sense, kind of a 
passenger on a big, relatively large vessel. They

18:38.109 --> 18:42.475
have very little to do with the planning or with the 
navigation, the operation of the vessels at sea,

18:42.758 --> 18:54.676
and usually don't know very much about what's 
going on except the specific sort of project

18:42.758 --> 18:54.676
they're engaged in. So I think we've lost 
something in this process, and

18:55.077 --> 19:08.057
there's still some, I think, activities of the 
type that I'm reminiscing about that are

19:08.341 --> 19:17.933
conducted in some nearshore work at various 
institutions. But still, I find the students have

19:17.953 --> 19:25.884
a very sort of narrow concept of what goes on. There 
we go. About 15 seconds here. What do you mean? It

19:30.890 --> 19:32.432
pauses now? Yeah, I've got a 15 second delay to make 
sure we don't overtake.

19:42.040 --> 19:55.952
Now, it's also been suggested that with the advent 
of the computer in terms of collecting data and

19:42.040 --> 19:55.952
evaluating it and so forth, particularly 
concerning physical oceanography, that the

19:42.040 --> 19:55.952
physical oceanographer loses touch with what 
he's doing. Would you agree with that? Well, I

19:57.594 --> 20:11.406
certainly would, and that's one of the things that 
has bothered me a good deal in recent years is that

19:57.594 --> 20:11.406
as the capability to take more data and to use a 
computer for various processing, routine

20:11.791 --> 20:40.262
processing, compilation, manipulation, 
compilation analysis, plotting, and so on, that

20:11.791 --> 20:40.262
the younger scientists don't have the kind of 
familiarity with the specific information that I

20:11.791 --> 20:40.262
think we had in years gone by. I think I can say with 
some confidence that I used to know every

20:40.883 --> 20:51.658
observation that had ever been made in most of the 
Pacific Ocean. And there weren't very many, but I

20:51.958 --> 21:00.650
knew every one and could evaluate

20:51.958 --> 21:00.650
it. I knew whether it was good or bad. I knew how it 
was related to other observations and so on. And

21:06.419 --> 21:10.384
this kind of an intimacy is certainly being lost 
today, students may not even see the set of

21:10.752 --> 21:16.200
original data in any form. Times have changed, and 
I'm harking back to a condition that will probably

21:17.663 --> 21:35.410
never prevail again, but I think something has 
been lost here.

21:35.693 --> 21:42.821
When you began to plan your voyages, let's say 
around 37 or 38, I'm interested in how you made your

21:35.693 --> 21:42.821
decisions, where to go, what to do. Was it pretty 
well dictated by the fisheries itself, or were you

21:43.201 --> 21:48.867
pretty free to do what you wanted to do? No, I would 
say that we were fairly free. I'm

21:53.592 --> 22:04.063
talking only in terms of really one more or less 
specific of operation, but within a rather

22:04.533 --> 22:33.156
general frame of reference, why we were allowed to 
plan our own program, and of course it was

22:04.533 --> 22:33.156
discussed with Alton Setty and Lionel Offord and 
others that were involved, but in general I think

22:04.533 --> 22:33.156
we decided what should be done and how it should be 
done and where to plan and so on. And that there

22:33.743 --> 22:44.716
was a considerable freedom in choice here in what 
we did. The other thing we were able to do at that

22:44.736 --> 22:55.389
time was to work out a fairly set of comprehensive 
programs as far as types of information gathered.

22:57.051 --> 23:00.375
There's certainly a case always of trying to 
optimize what we could do, because we had very

23:00.743 --> 23:07.314
limited resources in terms of money and people and 
equipment. So we had to select fairly carefully

23:07.374 --> 23:13.183
what we felt we could do. I have to remember that 
most of this was even before the days of the whole

23:13.204 --> 23:20.876
mechanical bathysemir graph, the VT. In fact, we 
had the experience of working with I think it was BT

23:25.837 --> 23:45.488
number 5, which was sent to us in the spring of 1941 
by Woods Hole when nobody even knew whether the

23:25.837 --> 23:45.488
instrument would function properly and had no 
kind of experience with the kind of information

23:25.837 --> 23:45.488
you could get with a device of that kind.

23:48.433 --> 23:52.519
When you were at Scripps in this period, was there 
much contact with international oceanography?

23:52.752 --> 23:55.135
Did you have any international oceanographers 
come through? Yes, we used to have quite a few

23:55.716 --> 24:20.852
visitors, at least relatively speaking, in that 
Professor Vaughn, who was the director from,

23:55.716 --> 24:20.852
actually I think it was from 1924 until 1936,

23:55.716 --> 24:20.852
had been relatively active in sort of 
international ocean activities. matters, and

24:21.558 --> 24:43.597
had a number of friends and professional friends 
in foreign countries, Japan, Europe, and so on,

24:21.558 --> 24:43.597
and we were one of the relatively few places that 
anyone interested in the ocean would come to visit

24:21.558 --> 24:43.597
in the United States. What I'm trying to say is 
there weren't very many places to visit, so we saw a

24:43.657 --> 24:50.383
good many of the of the distinguished people from 
other areas. And then when Professor Sverdrup

24:55.828 --> 25:08.486
came in, he had a very close bonds with many, many 
people in different fields and different

24:55.828 --> 25:08.486
countries, and this sort of continued in a way. And 
I can remember, in particular, we had one or more

25:09.748 --> 25:20.083
visits from Helen Hansen, a Norwegian 
oceanographer, and so we had reasonably good, I

25:21.042 --> 25:31.934
feel, in some ways, maybe better contacts than we 
have today. Now, when you were involved in this in

25:32.975 --> 25:39.563
the 30s, was there sort of a sense of excitement 
about moving out towards a new frontier? No, I

25:40.584 --> 25:42.246
don't think so. It was all good fun, but we didn't 
see any great manifest destiny or anything for We

25:50.371 --> 25:55.138
didn't think in terms of national ocean policy and 
so on. We just thought there were interesting

25:55.299 --> 25:59.665
scientific problems to be solved. And as I look 
back on it now, that period really before the war at

25:59.685 --> 26:18.775
Scripps, we were very much in sort of ivory tower, 
although as I've already indicated, we were

25:59.685 --> 26:18.775
beginning to move into what might be called 
applied oceanography as it was related to some of

25:59.685 --> 26:18.775
these fisheries problems. But ordinarily, 
though, this is still primarily research for its

26:19.700 --> 26:26.513
own sake rather than sort of the applied research 
that comes out between 1941 and 1945? Oh,

26:26.653 --> 26:30.661
yes. The funding of the institution at that time, 
the Scripps Institution, was basically all

26:39.393 --> 27:03.426
through the University of California, since the 
state funds reaching us through the university,

26:39.393 --> 27:03.426
except that in connection with the sardine 
investigations,

26:39.393 --> 27:03.426
the federal fisheries agency did provide money to 
help operate the vessel, which was the E.W.

27:10.821 --> 27:13.225
Scripps at that time. This is after the Blue Fin. 
We're getting in a number of omissions and so on in

27:15.267 --> 27:24.260
trying to trace the history of these things. But we 
were all, we were not We did not consider, as one

27:29.292 --> 27:36.101
would probably do now that we were dependent on 
federal funding to function. We were essentially

27:36.241 --> 27:45.934
supported through the academic funds from the 
University of California.

27:46.655 --> 27:54.625
There was also support from some of the members of 
the Scripps family, which was available at that

27:46.655 --> 27:54.625
time. There has also been discussion that perhaps 
the nature of oceanography has changed for the

27:55.870 --> 28:04.640
worse and that they have lost sort of a 
jack-of-all-trades approach. Would you agree

28:04.660 --> 28:05.441
with that? Well, this is, I think, where personal 
prejudice has come in, and I would agree that I feel

28:05.982 --> 28:22.401
that one of the things that attracted me to the 
field originally was the fact that we were able to

28:05.982 --> 28:22.401
deal with a what I consider is essentially a sort of 
a unified system, and where we could cross the

28:22.972 --> 28:45.141
disciplinary boundaries, which we did very 
freely at that time, between chemistry, physical

28:22.972 --> 28:45.141
aspects, biology, geology, without anybody 
raising an eyebrow. And we did try and deal with the

28:45.662 --> 28:49.367
systems well as we could as essentially unified 
systems. And I think today it's become fragmented

28:54.530 --> 29:15.135
again by specialization, which is partly, I 
think, the result of the interest of the

28:54.530 --> 29:15.135
scientists who come into the field, but it's also 
being encouraged in a sense, by the way in which the

29:15.875 --> 29:24.491
federal funding has become more and more 
specialized and fragmented. And I don't consider

29:25.834 --> 29:30.242
this desirable at all. Most of my efforts in recent 
years have been to try and bring the subject matter

29:30.963 --> 29:38.457
back together again as much as I can.
