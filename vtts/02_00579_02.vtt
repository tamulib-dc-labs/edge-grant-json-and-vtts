00:02.343 --> 00:05.327
Are you recording this time?

00:13.719 --> 00:20.349
Were journalists' methods changed during the 
60s?

00:20.369 --> 00:24.555
Well, I don't think the basic methods changed any. 
I can't recall that there were any revolutionary

00:24.655 --> 00:29.121
kinds of changes. I think that... They may have 
changed to the extent that there came to be less of a

00:31.891 --> 00:39.284
reliance on official sources for things. I think 
the kind of tension that grew up between

00:39.304 --> 00:54.169
journalists and public officials, especially 
the police and prosecutors and like that,

00:39.304 --> 00:54.169
probably probably led them to deal with other 
kinds of sources more. And I guess if that's a

01:00.456 --> 01:04.282
change in method, then yeah, you could say that the 
method changed. But beyond that, I can't think of

01:04.362 --> 01:09.891
anything that was essentially a change. There 
were, of course, parts of journalism that

01:09.911 --> 01:22.452
developed during that time, the so-called 
underground press and the and the so-called new

01:22.921 --> 01:39.507
journalism sort of thing that relied more on 
impressions and opinions and representations of

01:22.921 --> 01:39.507
situations rather than attempts to factually 
report situations, that kind of thing. But that

01:40.368 --> 01:43.794
was outside mainstream journalism. I don't think 
mainstream journalism changed much, except

01:43.854 --> 01:49.603
perhaps in a relationship of journalists to their 
sources. But there certainly was a development of

01:50.478 --> 01:54.844
these other forms of journalism. They really 
weren't new, of course. We've had that kind of

01:56.407 --> 01:59.751
thing from time to time throughout our history. 
But they certainly enjoyed a period of

01:59.852 --> 02:07.463
development at that time. And some of the elements 
in that journalism have since spilled over into

02:07.583 --> 02:20.181
journalism today in terms of probably more of an 
emphasis on explanation and interpretation.

02:21.055 --> 02:23.798
That's kind of an evolutionary change, I think. I 
guess, yes, there was change, and no, there

02:25.880 --> 02:30.685
wasn't.

02:30.705 --> 02:34.429
How prevalent were underground newspapers in 
Austin? Well, there was one that was very

02:34.449 --> 02:35.970
prevalent. It was called The Rag, which was 
published out around in the University of Texas

02:35.990 --> 02:40.855
neighborhood. And in the beginning, of course, 
The Rag was typical of that kind of thing, in which

02:41.536 --> 02:50.505
it went out of its way to try to shock the 
establishment there. Their vocabularies were

02:51.633 --> 03:08.574
pretty rich with four-letter words and they 
extolled the virtues of sex and drugs and nudity

02:51.633 --> 03:08.574
and anything that they calculated was going to 
infuriate the establishment. That was their

03:09.014 --> 03:10.036
style. As underground newspapers matured, they 
got away from that kind of deliberately

03:17.603 --> 03:31.436
outrageous shock value kind of thing and began to 
deal more with issues and it really became

03:17.603 --> 03:31.436
respectable. I guess the most clear example of 
that is the Los Angeles Free Press which began much

03:31.456 --> 03:45.028
in the way that I said and grew and remains an 
alternative kind of a newspaper, but one that

03:45.177 --> 04:00.011
certainly is not that far from the mainstream and 
has become very successful.

04:00.031 --> 04:14.644
I don't recall, around Austin, I don't recall that 
there was any other than the RAG, but the RAG was

04:00.031 --> 04:14.644
very widely distributed and widely read and

04:00.031 --> 04:14.644
certainly was a prominent feature of the of the 
University of Texas area at that time.

04:23.862 --> 04:29.813
You were mentioning

04:23.862 --> 04:29.813
less reliance on sources. What about 
journalistic ethics? Were they affected during

04:31.896 --> 04:34.461
this era? Well, I guess maybe they were in some 
degree because

04:42.805 --> 05:01.486
I think there was more of a willingness to use

04:42.805 --> 05:01.486
unnamed sources to protect sources because I 
think the feeling was that in order to get to the

04:42.805 --> 05:01.486
inside of some of these dissident movements that 
you had to deal with people on their terms. I think

05:02.668 --> 05:09.015
that as time passed that

05:13.113 --> 05:16.077
I guess we're getting really a little bit beyond 
this period. But the Pentagon Papers business,

05:16.117 --> 05:26.130
for example, was a willingness on the part of 
highly responsible newspapers to use stolen

05:16.117 --> 05:26.130
information. And so I think that presented an 
ethical problem, and it's one that journalism is

05:27.632 --> 05:32.719
still wrestling with. I think what happened was 
that as journalists became less and less willing

05:39.286 --> 06:08.598
to trust established sources, that is the 
officials, elected officials, police

05:39.286 --> 06:08.598
officials, that sort of thing, that they dropped 
into a kind of a situational ethic in which in order

05:39.286 --> 06:08.598
to get information that they were willing to 
justify means according to the ends that were

05:39.286 --> 06:08.598
being served. And so I think I think probably there 
came to be a higher reliance on situational ethics

06:09.813 --> 06:16.579
maybe during that period than there had been 
before. And that generated what is a continuing

06:17.881 --> 06:35.938
debate about that very kind of thing, about the use 
of anonymous sources, about the use of stolen

06:17.881 --> 06:35.938
information, about

06:17.881 --> 06:35.938
reporters operating undercover sting 
reporters, you know, journalistic sting

06:36.458 --> 06:42.945
operations, things like that. Those are still hot 
topics in journalism, and I think they were really

06:43.666 --> 06:58.682
generated beginning with this period we're 
talking about.

06:58.702 --> 07:04.288
How much did public and government distrust of 
media grow in this area? public and government

07:05.062 --> 07:10.972
distrust of the media.

07:11.433 --> 07:12.454
I think it did grow. And the reason I think that it 
grew is because the media were dealing with lots of

07:12.494 --> 07:25.897
subjects that the public really didn't want to 
acknowledge. I think public

07:31.927 --> 07:55.656
did not want to come to grips with the fact that the 
dissidents the hippies or whatever the term were

07:31.927 --> 07:55.656
that were being used for these people might have a 
point that they were human beings who were

07:31.927 --> 07:55.656
indulging in a different lifestyle all right i 
think that there was a feeling among a lot of people

07:31.927 --> 07:55.656
that the media were in effect promoting these 
disident causes, I think they sometimes felt that

07:57.020 --> 08:04.068
the media were promoting the use of marijuana and 
other drugs.

08:07.132 --> 08:22.791
I think that a feeling grew that because the media 
were covering these topics, that that

08:07.132 --> 08:22.791
automatically meant that the media favored these 
kinds of people and these kinds of lifestyles and

08:07.132 --> 08:22.791
that the media therefore were 
anti-establishment. Now, the truth of the matter

08:25.285 --> 08:33.676
is that if you read the editorial columns of that 
time, you're going to find that the mass media were

08:25.285 --> 08:33.676
about as conservative as ever. But in the news 
columns, I think quite a different kind of an

08:33.696 --> 08:39.803
impression might be gained. And especially as the 
media began to be critical of the Vietnam War, as

08:40.884 --> 08:52.238
the war grew on and there got to be a realization 
that that information was being jiggled around

08:52.640 --> 09:02.872
pretty significantly by the government and lots 
of lies were being told. And so I think that public

09:04.955 --> 09:15.087
and officialdom began to distrust the media sort 
of lumping the messenger in with the people where

09:15.860 --> 09:21.647
the messages came from that they didn't like. So 
yeah, I think distrust did grow during that

09:21.687 --> 09:25.832
period. I think the public doesn't distinguish a 
lot between editorial policies on the editorial

09:25.852 --> 09:38.408
page and news coverage. And I'm not sure that they 
distinguish very clearly Maybe they don't really

09:44.733 --> 09:54.026
differentiate as much as they should the 
difference between, say, the Los Angeles Free

09:44.733 --> 09:54.026
Press and the Los Angeles Times. They just sort of 
lump them all in there. And then television

09:56.269 --> 10:12.531
exacerbated that quite a bit, I think, because 
television, especially for the first time, very

09:56.269 --> 10:12.531
first time in our history, began to see pictures of 
a war that were unflattering to Americans. Always

10:12.551 --> 10:13.693
in the past, We had covered wars in a way that were 
unflattering to the other guy, but they didn't

10:14.753 --> 10:26.247
show that anything that was unflattering. Our 
people were always heroes, their people were

10:26.327 --> 10:30.471
always fiends. Well, in Vietnam, it didn't come 
out that way. It turned out maybe everybody was a

10:33.135 --> 10:36.198
fiend. It was a very confusing kind of war. And we 
had the things like the My Lai Massacre and all that

10:39.408 --> 10:44.953
kind of stuff. And so people had a high level of 
dissonance about all that. They didn't want to

10:54.222 --> 10:55.624
deal with it. It seemed that the media were going 
out of their way to portray a negative image of the

10:55.644 --> 11:07.255
United States and the United States Armed Forces 
and the United States purposes in Vietnam. And so I

11:08.163 --> 11:19.335
think that really, probably even more in print, 
increased the distrust of the public in

11:08.163 --> 11:19.335
officialdom. And that was during that time, of 
course, that people like Spiro Agnew were making

11:23.452 --> 11:36.892
speeches in which they were talking about the 
eastern liberal establishment and about how

11:23.452 --> 11:36.892
Walter Cronkite could raise an eyebrow and 
control the opinions of the nation and all that

11:23.452 --> 11:36.892
kind of thing. Television especially became a 
very easy scapegoat for the people who were trying

11:36.912 --> 11:48.308
to explain away all the social unrest and all the 
dissatisfaction with the Vietnam War and all that

11:36.912 --> 11:48.308
sort of thing. So, yep, the distrust certainly 
increased.

11:54.805 --> 11:57.908
Looking back, how extensive were the changes on 
the media?

12:00.691 --> 12:09.040
And did they affect the small town papers, medium 
papers, and the large papers equally, or in what

12:00.691 --> 12:09.040
proportion? Well, I think the things that have 
really affected the way mass media operate have

12:10.502 --> 12:17.729
been the recent technological changes. And those 
really were not in effect at that time. although

12:21.822 --> 12:27.592
some of the smaller papers already were beginning 
to switch to offset printing and that sort of

12:21.822 --> 12:27.592
thing. So there's a change in that regard. But I 
can't say beyond the kinds of things I've already

12:31.738 --> 12:42.616
talked about in terms of the relationship between 
the media and their sources and their audiences. I

12:43.898 --> 12:45.501
can't think of any special changes in operations 
or in techniques or anything like that that were

12:46.156 --> 12:54.810
especially different. Maybe my mind is only 
blank, but I really can't. It seems to me that

12:58.576 --> 13:12.838
significant changes have come about since that 
time in terms of development of cable television

12:58.576 --> 13:12.838
and satellite transmissions and television 
super stations in terms of really rapid

13:13.747 --> 13:19.235
development of printing techniques and 
electronic newsroom technologies and things

13:13.747 --> 13:19.235
like that. That's all happened since the period 
we're talking about.

13:27.968 --> 13:28.829
Well, thank you very much. You're welcome.
