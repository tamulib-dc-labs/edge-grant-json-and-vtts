WEBVTT

00:02.866 --> 00:04.448
In what city were you located? Oakland. In 
Oakland. He had, as I mentioned, sorry to tell you,

00:07.754 --> 00:24.039
he had known about me from my skiing, teaching 
skiing at Sugar Bowl, California.

00:24.059 --> 00:27.124
His girlfriend had taken a lesson from me. When 
would that happen? there

00:28.465 --> 00:43.757
would have to be 52 53 51 52 in there and then She 
evidently, like, said some nice things about me.

00:47.560 --> 00:58.110
So when he cornered me one time on a tennis court, we 
had played a couple of sets, and he said, you know,

00:47.560 --> 00:58.110
Dennis, what are you going to do after you come back 
from the ski season next year? I said, well, come

00:58.791 --> 01:02.294
and see me. I'm going into a brand new business that 
might need an outside setting. So when the time

01:10.702 --> 01:13.845
came around, I put on my Grave Lounge suit.

01:15.665 --> 01:16.987
Oh, yes, yes. Dodge Ridge Speed School. That was 
when I already worked for her. So you taught first

01:27.223 --> 01:28.805
at Sugar Bowl? Sugar Bowl. And the syrup of it a lot. 
And Bill Klein, my boss, I

01:38.935 --> 02:01.607
worked for him. He and his brother came home. His 
brother came and hired Bill to stay there. He

02:03.169 --> 02:03.430
stayed. He lived with his wife. who

02:04.754 --> 02:24.524
was the daughter from Professor Hildebrandt, 
famous professor at Berkeley. He had married one

02:24.544 --> 02:25.505
of the Hildebrandt daughters. They stayed at the 
Sierra Club in the middle of the club, and it's

02:25.525 --> 02:27.949
about five or six miles, and they commuted to 
Detroit. I worked in those days. It was horrible.

02:30.590 --> 02:48.605
Because

02:30.590 --> 02:48.605
they needed somebody to teach the Seraphim to go 
cross-country, so they could go to the outlying

02:30.590 --> 02:48.605
pandas overnight, stay overnight. And there 
weren't too many people who knew how to

02:48.625 --> 02:49.908
cross-country. Yeah, right. What do

02:50.789 --> 02:59.202
you like most about cross country skiing? What is 
it that appeals to you? Oh, actually, I like the

03:03.329 --> 03:08.036
alpine skiing itself. It's a basic course that you 
have to understand. You have to get from the lodge

03:09.539 --> 03:13.866
to the rift in a decent fashion, which means you 
have to climb, apply various climbing steps and

03:09.539 --> 03:13.866
cross country steps. And you can't look like a 
schlock to do it. You have to look like a pro, say.

03:18.953 --> 03:23.470
And now it's, of course, involved again. In my day, 
it was all Alpine skiing. Nobody except the

03:25.859 --> 03:27.867
Sarabove members. And they gave

03:28.252 --> 03:48.773
their members

03:28.252 --> 03:48.773
a little test.

03:48.793 --> 03:52.357
They wouldn't take you to one of the Grub Hut or 
Anderson Hut unless you had passed the test. And it

03:52.377 --> 03:53.598
was my job to prepare their members to pass this 
test. It was an ambition everybody wanted to do, to

03:53.618 --> 03:55.020
go to this outlying hut. Because it was, it is 
beautiful to go to. It's a day they feel they have

03:55.881 --> 03:56.782
their time. So quite an adventure. And a lot of them 
were from the University. Oh, the

03:58.424 --> 04:17.301
university

03:58.424 --> 04:17.301
had a lodge only about 150 feet from there, from 
Syracuse. They had a claripan lodge. The

04:22.566 --> 04:23.386
university had a lodge in the German. People built 
a lodge called the German Club. So there was, on a

04:24.307 --> 04:26.389
holiday, George Washington's birthday was, 
through the holiday, the 50th anniversary. 400

04:27.247 --> 04:44.446
people in a very small area. And Sugar Bowl I liked

04:44.466 --> 04:49.692
for one reason. You could not drive a car. And you 
were really way out. And I figured out no FBI agent

04:55.325 --> 05:02.242
was right, and I would never ski in, hook it into 
sugar bowl. I mean, I really relaxed. You know,

05:04.743 --> 05:14.096
anywhere else when the car could drive up, as long 
as, you know, people would, a car would pull up and

05:04.743 --> 05:14.096
two guys would get up. You know, who are they? You 
say, by the chuggerball, there was no way. If they

05:18.001 --> 05:23.709
had to come up there, they would come, they would 
hook them, and they'd be a lot more tired than you

05:18.001 --> 05:23.709
would by the time you got there. Yeah, yeah. So I'd 
have a few months of rest before running to my R&R.

05:31.039 --> 05:34.564
And during the summertime, you did what? That's 
the hard part. I see. In the beginning, I had to go

05:38.040 --> 05:49.543
get these part-time jobs as a fruit taker. I 
continued that on, which I'd learned in the

05:49.563 --> 05:53.992
beginning about this underground movement of 
laborers that followed fruits. I'd learned that.

05:54.693 --> 06:16.159
In

05:54.693 --> 06:16.159
the beginning, the contract broke out because I 
was riding with these hobos in the freight car, and

05:54.693 --> 06:16.159
they just didn't share with you. And they share 
information where you're going. They'd say

06:17.121 --> 06:19.283
they're going to El Centro with the oranges that 
they're going to be ripe in about a month or so. So

06:19.303 --> 06:19.924
we're going to pick oranges. Do

06:20.360 --> 06:34.457
you want to come along? He's a fraternity. Well, 
for one thing, we don't... They're not registered

06:35.716 --> 06:42.142
anywhere.

06:46.767 --> 06:47.648
You don't need a social security card.

06:53.073 --> 07:00.540
You can be other kinds of fugitives, too. You could 
be running away from your wife or alimony or

07:00.560 --> 07:01.841
whatever. They don't ask you, so they're kind of a 
good group to join. Sure, sure.

07:10.394 --> 07:25.855
No, it

07:10.394 --> 07:25.855
was New Mexico. Yeah,

07:25.875 --> 07:34.386
I ended up in California. Well, I caught, when I got 
out that night, they were all going to a movie, and I

07:34.406 --> 07:36.890
used the movie as a diversion. Hopefully. Before 
we get to the escape, let me hold that escape for a

07:37.130 --> 07:38.612
second. You were a camp translator. You went on an 
empty liberty ship. A liberty ship somehow built

07:44.423 --> 08:01.181
from North Africa to Camp Shanks, New York, or to 
Norfolk,

07:44.423 --> 08:01.181
Virginia, into the

07:44.423 --> 08:01.181
United States. Was it a difficult trip going 
across? Well, we were three, about three, I don't

08:01.961 --> 08:05.325
know, three, five, six, seven, eight. You

08:06.622 --> 08:29.568
were allowed to go smoking. And that's where I sold 
my cigarette case off. I wouldn't lie. Sold it to an

08:30.850 --> 08:31.430
American guard. But your officers were 
maintaining discipline over your troops? Yeah.

08:34.398 --> 08:46.941
And

08:34.398 --> 08:46.941
I don't know how that really comes about. It's a 
little strange, especially in the beginning, to

08:46.961 --> 08:48.644
build a strange relationship. Our officers are 
non-com officers, so I think it's a real

08:48.665 --> 08:50.027
structure. different units now but it didn't 
matter somebody had to do it which i think came back

08:50.007 --> 09:06.514
to that role playing that we were taught to begin 
with it makes it easy for us you know they could have

08:50.007 --> 09:06.514
asked me to take it and i would have done it And they

09:06.494 --> 09:13.563
would have followed. Whoever gets the command, 
they followed. They would report to the opposing

09:20.131 --> 09:24.837
officer, camp officer. Just like they would 
report to the highest ranking officer in the

09:24.857 --> 09:29.183
German army. So it was very

09:29.203 --> 09:33.949
little difference. Were you searched often for 
souvenirs and for belt buttons and all that sort of

09:33.969 --> 09:35.691
stuff? I think you're still wearing

09:36.329 --> 09:50.054
your, you're still wearing your, your African 
coin uniform. Yes, I think we finally had

09:50.074 --> 09:56.807
different clothes when we went to the workshop. 
Because if Elias doesn't defeat us in a mass

09:56.827 --> 09:59.552
production, they took, you know, they took all our 
clothes away, which made a lot of sense.

10:09.083 --> 10:30.855
There

10:09.083 --> 10:30.855
was nothing that you wanted because you had to 
carry it anyway. Well, I was thinking that they

10:31.713 --> 10:41.987
were taking things from you. Oh, they didn't. At

10:44.130 --> 10:47.594
American Guard. No, they wouldn't. They were too 
polite. They wouldn't answer me. They couldn't

10:51.380 --> 10:51.820
have it. And I didn't know if they were trading the 
box or something. No, the Americans were very

10:55.966 --> 10:57.548
polite. And they were, like I say, they were 
smiling. And, you know, there was no put-down of

10:58.489 --> 10:59.931
any kind that we felt, you know. What

11:00.653 --> 11:27.353
do you think when you saw the first American black 
troops? Well, I

11:27.586 --> 11:46.945
mentioned that one outfit that was all black feet 
and was a hundred feet tall and two or three inches

11:27.586 --> 11:46.945
and all their handguns and western type things 
flung low with a separate belt. It

11:47.414 --> 12:06.875
was all over with. That was strange. It was a 
specialty outfit at some point. We couldn't do the

12:08.077 --> 12:08.597
outfit. And we were looking at the restaurant. We 
had never seen it before. It was kind of different,

12:09.979 --> 12:11.160
but we didn't, we couldn't do it. We figured

12:11.866 --> 12:21.496
they had to be in Jeeps because they couldn't walk. 
They were so overweight. They were all 250 pounds.

12:24.940 --> 12:27.463
So we all gave them a Jeep, I guess. You know, they 
may have been MPs? No, I don't know. They had

12:33.009 --> 12:38.975
a white spot around them. Yes, you're right. 
Military police. Yes,

12:41.313 --> 13:07.546
they were segregated. Unless they were actually 
with these quarter books, they were segregated.

13:09.048 --> 13:09.649
I'm going to try to wash them.

13:13.038 --> 13:18.947
Do

13:13.038 --> 13:18.947
you have any questions?

13:30.537 --> 13:50.877
It

13:30.537 --> 13:50.877
won't matter to them. Don't worry about it at all. 
There's a group of, there are people who are

13:51.477 --> 13:53.179
waiting in conversation for transcripts. The 
University itself wants the tapes for the article

13:53.199 --> 13:54.881
for the University of America. Do you want to hear 
my question before you read the paper? Do you know

13:56.082 --> 13:57.003
what they want me to answer first? I'll hear it for 
you. I have a little story I'm going to move on to.

14:02.549 --> 14:11.832
Amen.

14:11.852 --> 14:11.952
Yeah.

14:16.808 --> 14:36.149
Actually,

14:16.808 --> 14:36.149
tennis, my doctor told me I had a curvature of the 
spine that should take up something. It was quite,

14:36.170 --> 14:36.670
quite thin. So it was before the major illness? 
Yes, yeah. So for medical reasons? For medical

14:38.112 --> 14:38.893
reasons, I got into tennis. And I just kept 
bouncing around. It seemed like I came right back.

14:40.552 --> 15:06.739
Not

14:40.552 --> 15:06.739
as well, I mean, I lost, I wouldn't win as many races 
like I would before, you know, but I still was

14:40.552 --> 15:06.739
better than average in those sports, which she was 
certain that saved my race. Yeah, you know, the

15:06.759 --> 15:07.960
other question was, I'm not a sportsman.

15:11.635 --> 15:34.335
Thank

15:11.635 --> 15:34.335
you.

15:41.690 --> 16:04.084
.

16:04.104 --> 16:04.124
. . .

16:11.305 --> 16:36.631
Well,

16:11.305 --> 16:36.631
we felt surrounded, I guess, because we were cut 
out from the real play. That's where we were. Yeah,

16:37.092 --> 16:37.532
we were filming. Maybe

16:37.985 --> 16:42.358
we'll cut out from the world and come back to it. .

17:08.877 --> 17:08.897
. .

17:13.490 --> 17:35.780
It

17:13.490 --> 17:35.780
seemed to me almost a replay of WWI. It bothered me. 
Because the people who wore this were the same

17:36.121 --> 17:37.202
people. I've

17:38.768 --> 18:03.647
read in history that this happens frequently, 
that the same war is fought two or three times, I

17:38.768 --> 18:03.647
think, the June War, the June War. And so we were 
historically in the same, so whatever, WWI was not

18:03.667 --> 18:05.350
finished, I guess.

18:12.299 --> 18:32.169
Well,

18:12.299 --> 18:32.169
I

18:12.299 --> 18:32.169
think they had some pretty lofty ideas. I think 
they, I would think that they were going for

18:32.189 --> 18:33.391
growth. They were going to go for all the models 
that they followed, that they were looking for

18:33.411 --> 18:35.434
other people. That's the impression I have of the 
way they went about it.

18:44.530 --> 19:10.332
Yeah.

19:10.352 --> 19:10.452
Yeah. Yeah. But

19:10.973 --> 19:21.135
I would say, I'm sure they had political demands, 
like one of my friends in the SS, and I'm sure that is

19:10.973 --> 19:21.135
true of the entire world. This part of the country 
has a military tradition

19:21.385 --> 19:39.911
that I'm from, you know, the eastern part, so I'm 
pretty great on whatever. So there was just

19:39.931 --> 19:42.575
military tradition type things. But I'm sure that 
first unit I was in in the Congress dated back from

19:42.595 --> 19:46.560
the great division. Ancient. Those horses and 
that equipment.

19:54.055 --> 20:00.960
What

19:54.055 --> 20:00.960
do you think about that?

20:20.279 --> 20:48.676
Is

20:20.279 --> 20:48.676
it my cigarette? I just snuck a cigarette in. 
That's

20:50.215 --> 21:09.577
my only

20:50.215 --> 21:09.577
advice. If I gave it up, I'd just have to find a new 
advice. Do you know what she was going to ask you?

21:13.622 --> 21:15.244
Well, I felt very much that it was, because I had 
read enough about W71. I just knew it was just an

21:15.264 --> 21:16.425
extension of that. because

21:17.215 --> 21:30.855
there were so many of

21:17.215 --> 21:30.855
the people, our adversaries, were practically 
the same. So, you know, I thought it was just a

21:30.875 --> 21:34.080
continuation of the discussion. And knowing 
enough about European history, that was not

21:34.100 --> 21:41.451
unusual, because we had a 100-year war, we had a 
30-year war, we had the Napoleonic Wars, So war is

21:42.173 --> 21:50.685
nothing unusual. You saw that one quote when I, 
that probably was true because I was getting very

21:50.705 --> 22:03.642
fed up, you know, a lot of, part of my motivation, 
and I wasn't just fed up with Germany, it was fed up

21:50.705 --> 22:03.642
with Europe, you know. That was probably quite 
true. I said, you know, I really had it with these

22:06.209 --> 22:09.492
guys, you know. Sure, sure. They were paying 
attention to me, so goodbye. Yes. I split. Good,

22:17.720 --> 22:17.940
good. Especially once finding out that the 
Russians had taken over that area. Yeah, it was

22:20.663 --> 22:25.527
nothing, you know, for me, because I certainly 
couldn't save my family. Guys my age, they were

22:25.547 --> 22:29.651
just, you know, gone. They were camps, and you 
can't survive them. The first time you get a cold,

22:34.435 --> 22:58.343
You're

22:34.435 --> 22:58.343
finished. You know, there's no way that you can get 
it. I was just very concerned and interested in

22:59.284 --> 23:02.247
what you were thinking about the fact that 
30-year-old boys and girls, which certainly is a

22:59.284 --> 23:02.247
great thing. You know a lot about them, don't you? 
Dry

23:03.612 --> 23:23.326
sandwiches at night, mostly bloodwurst. Stuff 
like that. No hot meals. Maybe if I came home, They

23:25.195 --> 23:45.268
and my father might make a ginseng broth or a duck or 
something, you know, on special occasions. But on

23:45.288 --> 23:46.670
the night, when I was a student, it was mostly dry 
sandwiches. It was dark bread, no butter, you

23:46.690 --> 23:47.892
know, really dry, nothing. So, died, you know, 
another day. Yeah,

23:48.533 --> 23:53.222
they thought I was a poor eater. You know, they'd 
give me big platters of dry sandwiches. They'd

23:56.609 --> 23:59.114
give you better food, you'd have been a better 
eater. Yeah, because I was a good eater in this

23:59.434 --> 24:01.779
country. You know, once

24:02.620 --> 24:08.652
I got... My hair was falling out terribly. When was 
this? Well, I was still a student. I wasn't even in

24:17.544 --> 24:20.468
the Army. I was using, you know, all these widow 
peaks, I said. I remember distinctly, I went to

24:24.794 --> 24:34.167
this cafe, you know, and I said, I'm going to be bald 
when I'm going to be, you know, because of all

24:24.794 --> 24:34.167
these, after you go through a fever, whenever you 
have something with fever, you use your hair, you

24:24.794 --> 24:34.167
know. And

24:34.467 --> 24:44.519
once I got decent credit, first of all, I ate 
nothing but fruit because I was a fruit picker. I

24:45.300 --> 24:47.262
had the best peaches. There are no peaches. You 
cannot buy those peaches that I ate when you're

24:48.884 --> 24:56.133
picking right off the tree. I mean, they're like an 
alcoholic beverage. They're so good. And, you

25:01.501 --> 25:05.750
know, cherries, ripe cherries are cheap. You 
cannot buy them. You have to be a picket. To get the

25:10.281 --> 25:11.303
best stuff. The best stuff. So, fruits which we 
never have in Germany. See, the very thing that I

25:15.332 --> 25:21.265
probably craved the most and needed the most to get 
back on my feet.

25:24.181 --> 25:41.184
And

25:24.181 --> 25:41.184
the needs,

25:24.181 --> 25:41.184
of course, were plentiful. Let

25:41.205 --> 25:46.272
me bounce back to the camps. Do the recollections 
of the different camps strike you? You went to

25:49.456 --> 25:50.157
camp. You were at Han. You were in...

26:06.925 --> 26:18.618
One I do, we worked in a hospital in Fort Knox, 
Kentucky, which I thought was very far off because

26:06.925 --> 26:18.618
I knew that's where all the gold in the world was. 
Yes, right. And I thought it was far off to be near

26:19.819 --> 26:30.651
all the gold in the world,

26:19.819 --> 26:30.651
most of the gold in the world. And then... But

26:32.103 --> 26:48.557
most of the time I was a translator. You were 
translating the foreign and the general

26:48.577 --> 26:50.280
population to the American officers? For the 
Germans.

26:56.093 --> 27:05.162
For the Germans.

27:05.182 --> 27:08.966
Yeah.

27:08.986 --> 27:16.614
Well, we had whoever was in command, the German 
side of it, would want to talk to the commander, the

27:08.986 --> 27:16.614
American commander, and usually the guy that 
would command the United States. Yes. Because he

27:16.734 --> 27:19.557
was probably, he had the most years in the regular 
army. Yes. So he was not... to

27:21.665 --> 27:43.370
train languages.

27:43.390 --> 27:43.791
But he had the rank. So he was in charge. And I would 
just transpire. And then. Like what kind of

27:44.992 --> 27:45.533
subjects? Orders would be passed on from the 
American commanding officer and camp commander.

27:47.215 --> 27:48.516
And he would say, I want all the population, camp 
populations who be

27:48.833 --> 28:08.436
sure to pick up all cigarette butts or something. 
So orders went back and forth. Back and forth, and

28:09.077 --> 28:13.542
what do you need, yeah, wishes, what can you use to, 
you know, they didn't really know what to do with

28:09.077 --> 28:13.542
them most of the time in the beginning, especially 
when they got into sports, soccer ball, you know,

28:13.522 --> 28:18.971
They wanted footballs and they didn't know soccer 
from football. That seems to be ancient. They can

28:20.573 --> 28:22.997
never get that straight. The jurors to this day 
cannot understand the difference between soccer

28:23.057 --> 28:29.327
and football. And then translate the newspapers. 
I got the news to read the American newspapers and

28:34.495 --> 28:38.922
the war reports. from

28:40.201 --> 29:04.154
the German high command that they carried in an 
American newspaper, and I was allowed to

28:40.201 --> 29:04.154
translate that for you. For the German high 
command, yes. Were you ever accused of anti- or

29:04.855 --> 29:05.977
pro-American behavior? Nobody ever suggested 
that you were too close to the American

29:05.997 --> 29:08.200
authorities or that you were too far from the... I 
managed to be right

29:09.023 --> 29:14.433
in your way. That's not me.

29:18.941 --> 29:20.002
I don't do that. But sometimes there's no choice. 
No, sometimes they cast you. They cast you or

29:25.652 --> 29:27.135
simply injure you. I know what you're saying, but 
it's not for my own good. I'm just going to show you

29:29.840 --> 29:31.082
that there's someone who can do it. No, I

29:31.771 --> 29:39.966
don't know what's behind it. Like you say, they can 
accuse you of it, but you can't prove it otherwise.

29:47.200 --> 29:51.227
Once they label you, you know, I stopped beating my 
wife. Yes, yes, sure. When? Yeah. I

29:53.067 --> 30:14.996
have, you know, some friendship and respect with 
almost anybody. And even to this day, in all my

30:15.016 --> 30:18.160
dealings with people, I've been very fortunate to 
be able to always have that, you know, hope for

30:15.016 --> 30:18.160
people that are holding us. So there was no 
difficulty? What possessions did you have in the

30:18.741 --> 30:19.582
camp? You couldn't have been captured by a whole 
lot.

30:27.323 --> 30:53.081
I

30:27.323 --> 30:53.081
remember falling down. I was in Texas. And it was 
difficult. It was standing. And I fell down and

30:54.203 --> 30:55.064
dislocated my shoulder. And was it a family thing? 
Wouldn't be surprised. But I did win the camp

30:56.086 --> 30:56.807
championship. Yes,

30:59.285 --> 31:11.658
yes.

31:11.678 --> 31:22.510
So when

31:11.678 --> 31:22.510
you were on the run, you didn't have anything left 
from your earlier days? I had one movement. I had

31:22.930 --> 31:23.591
traded a ring from America. In North America? 
Silver. And it had a... very

31:26.234 --> 31:52.875
graceful graphic in black inmates and civilians, 
especially the feet of a running, either a

31:26.234 --> 31:52.875
steinbock or an antelope or something, which I 
associated with me. Who is a graceful, running,

31:52.895 --> 31:53.756
jumping animal? Who kept that in mind? In fact, I 
took a

31:54.854 --> 32:19.339
handmade, leather-shaded pattern. And I had that 
made in Iraq. And it was long time ago. It's still in

32:20.460 --> 32:20.900
America. OK, you can evaporate it all the time. So 
you should put it in there so that every time it

32:21.701 --> 32:23.443
comes back, you know it's in there. In

32:24.318 --> 32:42.775
the ring or the... I know this. Well, it's 
certainly not something that you would have been

32:44.230 --> 32:49.900
able to know about. Yeah, and I couldn't explain 
it. I couldn't even wear it. It was just a good luck

32:53.747 --> 32:56.371
charm. But it was a graceful,

32:56.391 --> 33:08.012
you know, as I mentioned, I'm in graphics, and I'm a 
student, and I'm a symbol. Yes. of

33:08.092 --> 33:30.154
race and flight, speed and prowess and success. 
But there was no, of course, agreement or no

33:30.174 --> 33:31.275
agreement. But you see, psychologically, it's 
important, when you're on the loose, to have

33:31.295 --> 33:33.097
something. However small, you have to have 
something that reminds you of the old, of where

33:33.117 --> 33:35.179
you're from and what... As a matter of fact, I got a 
psychological...

33:36.610 --> 33:56.660
You found that

33:36.610 --> 33:56.660
out,

33:36.610 --> 33:56.660
huh? Well, I have a psychological study called On 
Remaining the Same Person. Once you're on the

34:01.247 --> 34:03.611
loose, there are certain things that you have to do 
to remain the same person that you were before. And

34:03.631 --> 34:04.913
one of the things that you shouldn't have is any 
possessions that everybody has, however small.

34:08.076 --> 34:18.751
Maybe you need

34:08.076 --> 34:18.751
a mind,

34:08.076 --> 34:18.751
but something you need that's part of you. Oh,

34:19.212 --> 34:23.358
no, no. This isn't a... Yes. Oh, absolutely. Yes, 
sure. She gave me a marvelous gold ring. Why would I

34:27.663 --> 34:29.285
keep that silver one? Yes. How you describe that in 
flight. Oh, in flight? Oh, yes. In flight and

34:33.632 --> 34:35.335
stability. You know, we've been doing this. Oh, 
yes. It's just... It served me well at that time.

34:44.028 --> 34:47.132
You have other, you have new things all the time. Of 
course, of course. You change. Yes. And you're

34:51.478 --> 34:52.099
right. You have to. That was one of the decisions I 
made, that I was going to remain the same person. I

35:00.731 --> 35:08.222
was not going to be an actor, play act, try to be 
something, you know, and act something out. First

35:08.903 --> 35:10.405
of all, I'm not an actor. So I wasn't even going to 
try that. I was going to be... But I was going to find

35:14.066 --> 35:20.198
my cover that would be as close to me as possible. 
Which was... I have to apologize to Candy because I

35:24.121 --> 35:29.468
said I was from Connecticut. That had snow. I knew 
it had snow. I'd never been to Connecticut, but I

35:32.433 --> 35:34.616
knew it had snow. And I knew it had some small towns. 
And I knew nobody is from Connecticut. I'd never

35:40.904 --> 35:43.488
met anybody from Connecticut in California. I had 
to find all these things to make a story that would

35:43.688 --> 35:49.637
fit me as a person. I'll bet you became a good actor. 
I'll bet you And strangely enough,

35:53.264 --> 36:00.415
I'm just going to interject this. That integrity 
that he has always had was what was so confusing to

36:00.435 --> 36:19.103
me later on when I couldn't track that with the 
shallowness and the rest of his relationship with

36:00.435 --> 36:19.103
me, that we could only go this far in who he really 
was. You know, when the chips were on the line. Yes,

36:22.581 --> 36:23.422
yes. Who really are you? That was the hardest part 
because I knew he had this, he was all together as a

36:26.586 --> 36:38.903
person somewhere, but I couldn't get at that, only 
that superficial layer. So he always was his own,

36:38.923 --> 36:43.288
and he still is. He is that person. Don't act. 
Except for the cover story. Yes, yes. And whenever

36:47.788 --> 36:55.099
that came up, I tried to either leave the room, 
change the subject, do some diversion. Because I

36:55.399 --> 36:57.422
don't like to go into that. It's such a dumb cover 
story. I don't even want to think about it. You

37:01.809 --> 37:03.491
know, I hate it. But that was the story I had, too, 
for 19 years. The Connecticut story? Did you say

37:08.153 --> 37:10.617
born in Connecticut or just the story? What did 
they say? You were born and raised in upper state

37:12.619 --> 37:21.791
New York, went to phonetic school for boys, an 
agress non-existent. Your parents were killed in

37:21.931 --> 37:30.602
an automobile accident when they were 45, 
something like that, and nobody stopped to think

37:21.931 --> 37:30.602
about it. Yes.

37:59.978 --> 38:05.144
Although, you know, I know people from Milwaukee 
who were born in this country who have a very thick

37:59.978 --> 38:05.144
accent. And in California. Who would know? But I 
think instinctively, somehow, instinctively, I

38:08.488 --> 38:17.379
stayed away from anybody German. To this day? To 
this day. We played tennis at Diamond Head, and

38:19.522 --> 38:26.450
there's a bunch of

38:19.522 --> 38:26.450
Germans there that work in the company. I never 
talked to them.

38:30.117 --> 38:35.902
I think these guys that got caught, they went to, 
they were glad to see somebody they could talk to,

38:30.117 --> 38:35.902
could understand. Yes, that's exactly right. 
They usually, many of these men did get caught

38:37.744 --> 38:43.709
because they... That's the worst thing you can do. 
You've got to stay away from your own kind. What

38:46.652 --> 38:54.579
other rules would you say are things to know in 
remaining a successful fugitive? Don't go around

38:54.599 --> 38:58.302
people who speak the same language. It's anywhere 
near that background, anywhere near. Murphy's

39:03.756 --> 39:06.739
Law is very important. Whatever's going to go 
wrong will go wrong. So if you plan for everything

39:08.481 --> 39:10.443
that could go wrong. As soon as you see the least 
little problem arising, you must observe

39:10.643 --> 39:20.174
Murphy's Law at all times. Like, you know, you 
cannot go to the elevator with something up. My

39:25.180 --> 39:26.963
dear darling wife. Yes. Always turn. Thanks, 
darling. I mean, you know, that has to be covered.

39:33.332 --> 39:35.556
Sure. And... The other night she used the example 
of how you put your fork and knife down on the plate.

39:40.703 --> 39:44.809
And as soon as I found out, you do not put it down, you 
know, like the Europeans. Yes. All they had to do

39:45.470 --> 39:47.654
was look for a guy that did that. Yes. You must learn 
the customs and... of eating with your changing

39:53.142 --> 39:58.449
fords, you see? And you don't insist of doing it 
your way. You must blend and take on that. Well,

40:05.860 --> 40:09.865
that was one of the things, now that you, this 
brings it back. I remember I made a very basic

40:09.945 --> 40:13.370
decision. I simply said, now, they won't let me, 
since I'm not born American, But I want to be an

40:22.724 --> 40:23.945
American.

40:26.588 --> 40:27.469
I'm going to be an American. I've simply made up my 
mind to be an American. It's just as simple as that.

40:34.075 --> 40:37.018
So I became an American. And that's why I say I 
blocked everything off. I did not go halfway. Say,

40:43.545 --> 40:47.449
I want to stay German, half German, whatever. I 
want to keep this. No. I said, I want to be an

40:50.552 --> 40:52.714
American. A hundred percent. She always says, 
you're more American than I am. In what ways would

40:58.115 --> 40:59.177
you say? Do you mean habits? Philosophically, 
politically. I'm American enough that I can just

41:06.226 --> 41:10.472
really run this country down. Yes, oh sure, sure. 
And he tempers my anger at the American system and

41:14.156 --> 41:22.127
all that kind of stuff. Supportive.

41:35.437 --> 41:41.267
Oh, like what?

41:41.287 --> 41:41.668
Government systems. She knows less about the 
system than I do. You have to make it your business

41:46.147 --> 41:48.192
to find out. And read.

41:52.404 --> 41:57.919
You have to read the paper every day. and study, you 
have to continue your education. I saw the

42:03.180 --> 42:04.703
certificates. That's nice. And in the 50s and 60s, 
I would read all the books like How to Become a

42:05.724 --> 42:13.676
Millionaire. What's Dale Carnegie? How to Be 
Successful and Influence People. That was a big

42:20.867 --> 42:22.770
bestseller. The Art of Public Speaking.

42:30.805 --> 42:34.529
Peterson, Peter's Principle. Peter Principle. 
All these books. She threw them all out when we

42:41.997 --> 42:43.579
left. I had all these books. And just keep going on 
your education. When you left? Just recently?

42:55.021 --> 42:57.725
Well, right after we got married, we moved. We had, 
what, some houses in California. And moving

43:01.269 --> 43:03.292
always involved, you know, books. I see. You still 
read this thing? No? You say no, that means no. I

43:09.941 --> 43:11.884
travel light. I perpetuate it. It's his behavior. 
Which is all right, because if you don't, the book

43:14.688 --> 43:18.733
doesn't really do you any good if it doesn't. If you 
don't have it up here, it's not going to do it.

43:21.691 --> 43:28.621
Although you could use it probably for reference,

43:21.691 --> 43:28.621
but most people don't do that. So you would say a 
rule is never go among people of the same ethnic

43:28.641 --> 43:34.310
background. Always keep Murphy's Law in mind. 
Remember what could go wrong and try to plan

43:37.595 --> 43:41.020
against it.

43:45.727 --> 43:46.027
What? Yes. Custom. Observe the customs. Don't

43:49.831 --> 43:56.736
give too much information. Oh, no. Don't give any 
information. I mean, don't tell more about

44:01.484 --> 44:05.568
yourself or more about a story than is needed. 
Would that be? No, that's correct. That's

44:07.771 --> 44:08.872
absolutely correct. And you become a good 
listener because your conversation isn't that

44:09.533 --> 44:21.446
good, which is a good habit to have anyway. You 
learn to listen. I was probably a big talker in

44:23.969 --> 44:27.535
Germany. I was just going to say, later on though, 
that turned itself around and you became a very

44:27.555 --> 44:37.692
good talker.

44:37.712 --> 44:44.023
But you didn't want real close relationships, so 
you talked a lot.

44:44.143 --> 44:46.888
But never anything... below the superficial 
level. Oh, philosophical. You and I are each

44:51.146 --> 44:58.114
other's very best friends because we don't have a 
lot of things. And that's by both of our choices. We

44:58.975 --> 45:02.279
just never let anybody get below that. Yeah. You 
know, like couples, some couples are very, very

45:03.100 --> 45:06.064
close. They know everything about each other. 
Right, right. Play bridge three times a week. So

45:10.829 --> 45:14.193
we've never had a lot of friendships. We have a lot 
of good friends, but... who don't stay around here

45:16.838 --> 45:23.208
long enough so that they can get their attention. 
That sounds like you were made for one.

45:24.830 --> 45:25.351
Absolutely. Made for one. Absolutely. Ideal, 
made. You must find the ideal mate. Put that down.

45:32.302 --> 45:34.125
You must find the understanding. I didn't want 
anybody to get that close to me to understand me

45:34.145 --> 45:39.032
beyond this whatever it is. And so we never pushed 
each other. Actually, it's just sheer luck with

45:41.115 --> 45:43.058
these things. Maybe it's some instinct, but a lot 
of it is just sheer luck. All these rules wouldn't

45:46.584 --> 45:58.482
do you any good if you just had some bad luck 
somewhere along the line and ran into somebody

45:46.584 --> 45:58.482
that knew you or something. You have to have some 
luck. But this is a funny one. I just found that the

46:00.365 --> 46:02.088
other day. Gene lets me keep this. This is from in my 
heyday. Two girls? Yeah, two girls. These are

46:07.933 --> 46:10.697
showgirls from the Mapes in Reno. One on my right 
said she was a German countess. She may have been a

46:17.687 --> 46:20.391
countess, but she was definitely German. And 
which also was a good, a very, well, it was kind of

46:21.553 --> 46:30.045
tragic at the end because...
