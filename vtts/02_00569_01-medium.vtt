WEBVTT

00:01.398 --> 00:13.454
when non-black students were integrated into an 
all-white school after the 1954 Supreme Court

00:01.398 --> 00:13.454
ruling that separate was not equal and we should 
integrate with all deliberate speed, right?

00:15.296 --> 00:15.557
That's right. Okay. Well, do you want to start by 
telling us something about your background,

00:16.518 --> 00:25.870
about your education and your term as mayor and a 
little bit about the background of the Little Rock

00:16.518 --> 00:25.870
crisis? Born and raised in Little Rock. Went to 
public schools there. Graduated Little Rock

00:31.051 --> 00:35.281
Central High School in 1934. Went to University of 
Illinois. Graduated in 38 and worked in Chicago.

00:45.982 --> 00:51.932
Served as a naval officer in World War II and came 
back to Little Rock in December 1945. Became

00:53.615 --> 00:58.643
active in politics.

00:59.084 --> 01:01.468
Were you active in politics before you were mayor? 
Oh, yes. What kind of things did you do? Active in

01:05.835 --> 01:21.861
the Democratic Party, supporting and raising 
money for people seeking office on all levels, and

01:05.835 --> 01:21.861
then decided in 1955 to run for mayor of Little 
Rock. had planned to, within two to four years, run

01:23.495 --> 01:29.321
for governor of the state. That was my plan. Could 
you tell us a little bit about the background

01:31.463 --> 01:39.491
between the court case and when Faubus called in 
the guard? Well, when the Supreme Court ruled in

01:40.813 --> 01:50.042
1954 that the

01:52.739 --> 02:07.640
doctrine had been in effect for oh well and 
accessible hundred years that equal but separate

01:52.739 --> 02:07.640
facilities for whites and blacks was the way to run 
the educational system. Their decision changed

02:08.602 --> 02:16.333
it and said that the facilities for blacks were not 
equal to and in effect said that since the states

02:16.769 --> 02:35.786
are not willing nationwide to provide the money 
for blacks, that they were being deprived of their

02:16.769 --> 02:35.786
constitutional right for equal facilities for 
education, and that there should be a gradual

02:16.769 --> 02:35.786
integration of students regardless of color. And 
it was a very controversial decision in all parts

02:37.427 --> 02:46.135
of the country, not just the South.

02:47.954 --> 03:04.971
But since it was rooting of the Supreme Court,

02:47.954 --> 03:04.971
the states then and the individual school 
districts across the country began to put

02:47.954 --> 03:04.971
together gradual integration plans. At that 
particular time, a friend of mine named Bert

03:06.493 --> 03:17.944
Blossom was the superintendent of schools in 
Pulaski County.

03:19.072 --> 03:47.138
Even though he did not agree with the Supreme Court 
ruling, he accepted it as a so-called law of the

03:19.072 --> 03:47.138
land and

03:19.072 --> 03:47.138
put together a gradual plan that by meetings 
throughout the community, radio and television,

03:19.072 --> 03:47.138
over a period of a couple of years, the public knew 
about it. And there appeared to be no

03:47.877 --> 04:06.213
reason to believe that the plan which was adopted 
by the school board unanimously would meet any

03:47.877 --> 04:06.213
objection in the community or the city. Is this the 
way you felt? Any violence. That's what the school

04:08.395 --> 04:10.117
board felt. The school board voted unanimously 
after carrying it to the community. and even the

04:16.447 --> 04:22.517
newspapers agreed that the plan would be 
acceptable.

04:25.723 --> 04:40.648
Governor Faubus, who was already a controversial 
figure and was completing his first term as

04:25.723 --> 04:40.648
governor, had already agreed, or his second term 
as governor, has already agreed to step down and

04:41.455 --> 04:45.659
not seek re-election. And

04:47.301 --> 05:07.260
he decided with half a dozen or so friends that they 
would oppose the school board's decision or plan.

05:08.894 --> 05:20.486
He did this in such a dramatic fashion that he went 
on television on Sunday night before schools were

05:08.894 --> 05:20.486
to be integrated the following day in September of 
1957. And he said that there was rioting, that

05:20.506 --> 05:32.619
people across the country, across Arkansas and 
the whole state, the whole country would be coming

05:20.506 --> 05:32.619
in. There would be rioting on the streets and that 
people would be killed and slaughtered and so

05:33.120 --> 05:38.125
forth and so on. You say that perpetrated fraud 
upon the people of Little Rock particularly and

05:38.105 --> 05:47.507
the country as a whole because claim to those of us 
in the state involved with what was happening,

05:47.757 --> 06:03.437
that he was using this to perpetuate himself in 
offices as long as he wanted to be governor of the

05:47.757 --> 06:03.437
state of Marksville, which happened. He called in 
2,000 National Guardmen, and they surrounded the

06:03.497 --> 06:10.086
school.

06:11.180 --> 06:17.430
Were these half a dozen friends, were they 
political figures also or just personal friends

06:11.180 --> 06:17.430
of his? No, we met on what he announced on Sunday 
evening. And we called a meeting that night. And

06:32.593 --> 06:36.259
the governor of the state, no, the ex-governor of 
the state, Sid McMahon, the Lieutenant Governor

06:37.218 --> 06:59.335
of the state, I can't remember his name, one of the 
Senators, Congressman Brooks Hayes,

06:37.218 --> 06:59.335
Virgil Blossom, and most of the school board were 
present. And we

07:02.885 --> 07:10.956
were there to make some kind of decision how to meet 
the crisis that was certain to arise because the

07:02.885 --> 07:10.956
school was already surrounded. Because he came on 
television and said the school was surrounded

07:10.976 --> 07:15.101
just when it was. They were surrounded. Didn't he 
warn that blood would run in the streets of Little

07:16.182 --> 07:22.250
Rock if the blacks tried to enter the school? Yes. 
How did the crowd react to the guards being around

07:23.523 --> 07:26.786
the school? I mean, the guards themselves 
wouldn't let the kids through. And I read that one

07:31.390 --> 07:45.824
girl, Elizabeth Eckford, I believe is her name, 
came up and thought that the guards would protect

07:31.390 --> 07:45.824
her because she didn't realize what had been said 
in the student

07:31.390 --> 07:45.824
superintendent meeting. And she had tried to go 
through to the school anyway and felt that even the

07:46.725 --> 07:52.450
guards were giving her hate stares. Do you think 
that the guards had? They were there to keep them

07:53.812 --> 07:56.115
out. The guard was there to keep them out of school. 
But do you think that the guards had their, I mean,

07:58.798 --> 08:04.826
in their own opinion, were the guards against the 
National Guard? It's hard to say. It's hard to

08:07.008 --> 08:10.913
determine if the 2,000 were for or against it, but 
they had no choice. They were members of the

08:10.933 --> 08:13.937
National Guard, and they were called out by the 
government of the state. They had to be there. But

08:16.641 --> 08:20.125
they were instructed not to let them in school, not 
to escort them in. The only way in the world, this

08:20.830 --> 08:30.609
was a decision that was made that night, that the 
only way in the world they were going to get in was

08:20.830 --> 08:30.609
that, and this was done with Washington, D.C.'s 
approval. We were dealing directly with, at that

08:30.629 --> 08:37.282
point, Richard Nixon, who was vice president. 
Attorney General. I can't remember his first

08:39.983 --> 08:40.984
name. His last name was Rogers. I can't remember 
his first name. But it was determined that they

08:44.789 --> 08:48.855
would provide U.S. Marshals

08:48.915 --> 08:55.684
to assist those nine students. Did you call the 
President and ask him for support? Well, it was a

09:00.190 --> 09:02.332
spontaneous situation. The decision was made 
that night that we had to take immediate action and

09:02.392 --> 09:06.618
do something. Otherwise, we would have an awful 
lot of trouble. How long after the nine children

09:09.599 --> 09:18.531
tried to enter the school against the National 
Guard did it take before the troops came down and

09:09.599 --> 09:18.531
they actually got to go inside? I think a week or so. 
I'm not real sure. I'm not real sure. It didn't go on

09:24.159 --> 09:29.066
very long because nothing could happen. One of the 
things we would say, we called out Well, there were

09:33.173 --> 09:39.743
about 350 policemen at that particular time, 
about 350 firemen. And part of the plan agreed on

09:39.763 --> 10:00.396
was that we would call, use approximately 75% of 
the police force and the firemen, the police force

09:39.763 --> 10:00.396
with no guns, only with their, what do you call 
those? Not what you call the clubs or so forth and so

10:01.405 --> 10:04.908
on. They weren't called that. And the firemen only 
with fire hoses. And... Is that to ward off the mob?

10:12.275 --> 10:16.698
Yes, to prevent any mob violence and so forth and so 
on. But definitely no shooting because that would

10:16.758 --> 10:29.169
defeat what we're trying to do and that is to 
preserve peace and order and no violence and

10:16.758 --> 10:29.169
people being killed or injured. And... The 
strange thing about the whole situation was that

10:30.633 --> 10:39.527
when I, as mayor, ordered this to be done, the chief 
of police and the chief of the fire department both

10:30.633 --> 10:39.527
resigned. They would not do it. Because they 
didn't believe in the desegregation. Didn't

10:44.035 --> 10:45.998
believe in it. And we had to bring in assistance.

10:53.549 --> 11:02.242
How do you feel that this integration or the 
desegregation of Central High School could have

10:53.549 --> 11:02.242
taken place without the guard? Do you think it 
would have gone over smoothly? No problem. You

11:04.866 --> 11:06.609
don't think there would have been any problem? 
Whatever.

11:10.154 --> 11:15.642
The responsibility of the individual school 
districts was spelled out. the governor of the

11:16.448 --> 11:22.057
state and the federal government had no business 
at all interfering. It was not their

11:23.119 --> 11:24.601
responsibility. It was the responsibility of the 
board members and they'd already arrived at a

11:24.621 --> 11:27.646
plan. It had taken two years to make certain that 
the public agreed with and was familiar with the

11:28.387 --> 11:41.629
plan and that it would come off according to the way 
it had been explained many, many, many times. And

11:41.609 --> 11:56.431
had this action not been taken by the governor, 
there's no doubt in question at that time and now

11:41.609 --> 11:56.431
that it would have gone, you know, maybe some 
minor, but nothing unusual. Did you hear any

11:56.852 --> 12:01.018
rumors or anything of any violence that would have 
happened? Like, I mean, I know Fava's blew it way

12:01.339 --> 12:08.029
out of proportion that you didn't hear of hardly 
any. So, um... Oh, he had brought in 15 or 20

12:09.250 --> 12:24.448
people with a reputation of being 
rabble-rousers, we call them, to excite and

12:09.250 --> 12:24.448
incite rioting. As a matter of fact, the FBI knew 
that. And that was our job, to make certain that...

12:33.584 --> 12:58.242
bob did get excited and of course when it came on 
television the next morning there were triple

12:33.584 --> 12:58.242
thousand people out there just you know just going 
crazy you know going crazy i know there's so many

12:33.584 --> 12:58.242
people out there against the desegregation but 
were there a lot of people in the community that

12:33.584 --> 12:58.242
were for it that believed in it or were they most 
most of the most of the black people were obviously

12:33.584 --> 12:58.242
uh And a small percentage of the white people. You 
couldn't tell what percent. A lot of them didn't

13:04.132 --> 13:08.136
want to say anything because... A lot of people 
didn't care. Didn't bother. Didn't make a

13:08.456 --> 13:10.718
difference. What role do you feel that the media 
played in the... Did you think it was good or bad? I

13:15.002 --> 13:17.645
know that it showed the whole world. Grossly 
over-exaggerated. Oh, really? Locally,

13:19.727 --> 13:21.609
statewide, worldwide. You think it helped any? 
Grossly. All it did was... bring the situation to

13:28.563 --> 13:45.672
the attention of people that should have never 
been concerned about it, people that lived in

13:28.563 --> 13:45.672
other parts of the country, people who got 
involved that should have given it a second

13:28.563 --> 13:45.672
thought. It was a local matter. Just grossly 
over-exaggerated.

13:51.301 --> 13:53.625
The morning after it happened, after they 
integrated the school? After that particular day

13:56.136 --> 14:09.191
in September, the morning after it happened, 
there must have been 150 newsmen from all over the

13:56.136 --> 14:09.191
world in the mayor's office with television 
cameras. That's when I first met John Chancellor.

14:12.394 --> 14:13.395
Oh, really? I met him that day, and he was just a 
young man getting started. But they had him all

14:18.641 --> 14:20.083
over the world. They just wanted a scoop. They 
wanted some juicy gossip. That was it. That was the

14:23.947 --> 14:29.718
biggest news item worldwide. You were saying 
earlier that people just weren't accustomed to

14:30.299 --> 14:37.633
having blacks have any kind of freedom about 
eating lunch at any counters. No, no. Up until that

14:38.736 --> 14:44.166
point,

14:38.736 --> 14:44.166
the black people... all over the country, 
particularly the South. They didn't eat in

14:47.356 --> 14:50.040
restaurants. They didn't go to picture shows and 
sit in balconies. Public transportation, they

14:53.667 --> 15:00.479
sat in the back, including railroads, airplanes.

15:02.742 --> 15:05.968
And they were discriminated against. Had any of 
this started changing yet by the time that this

15:06.235 --> 15:10.380
little rock? Really not. I know one of the things 
that when I went in office as mayor in January of 56,

15:10.861 --> 15:32.388
for 150 years, the fountain, public fountains, 
water fountains, they were separate for black and

15:10.861 --> 15:32.388
for white. Restrooms were black and white, you 
know. We changed them all. During your... Within

15:40.579 --> 15:41.460
the first week. Oh. Within the first week, we 
changed. This was something that was done because

15:44.983 --> 16:07.545
I felt they were citizens of the city and that they 
paid taxes like anybody else and that there was no

15:44.983 --> 16:07.545
reason why when they walked in the city hall for any 
reason that they should have to go to a separate

15:44.983 --> 16:07.545
restroom or go to a... break water out of a 
separate... And there was nothing said about it.

16:10.327 --> 16:19.375
ignore press it was a lot of people felt 
differently that they should be different that

16:10.327 --> 16:19.375
they were different people How did you come to be so 
open-minded? Was it from your parents' views or

16:23.070 --> 16:28.841
from school or just your own personal 
disposition? No, I had grown up in a family of

16:29.602 --> 16:37.356
modest men. My father was in the commercialized 
business all of his adult life. He hired and worked

16:41.596 --> 16:50.344
with 15 to 25 people, and they were both black and 
white. And I didn't have any particular feelings

16:50.364 --> 16:58.052
about either way. I didn't realize in growing up 
what it meant to be discriminated against at that

16:58.192 --> 17:08.582
particular time. That's a neat view to see because 
you hardly ever hear about anyone who was

17:09.389 --> 17:18.762
open-minded about race relations at all during 
that time. Well, I went to school at the University

17:19.323 --> 17:25.993
of Illinois at North. I went to elementary and high 
school in Arkansas. There were no blacks in

17:29.818 --> 17:31.641
school. I went up there in almost every class. Uh, 
we would have a few black students involved with

17:36.625 --> 17:42.313
me. You know, some a reason why it should. They were 
just as radiant or more so than most of the white

17:43.855 --> 17:48.781
kids in college. They really didn't bother me. And 
I'd worked in Chicago and Illinois for four years

17:50.864 --> 17:56.912
before I went in service. Same thing, I worked with 
blacks. They mostly were white. I was a naval

18:03.299 --> 18:04.720
officer in World War II. And the same thing, we had 
black officers on the Admiral Dempsey's staff,

18:04.740 --> 18:11.167
which I served on for 18 or 19 months. And it didn't 
bother me. It really didn't bother me. Did it seem

18:15.031 --> 18:17.314
to bother other people that were on the staff with 
you? No. They were accepted, you know. How was

18:20.939 --> 18:23.923
Horace Mann High School? Was it in the books? Just 
as good or better than Little Rock High School.

18:29.452 --> 18:30.433
Just as good or better. A lot of the arguments seem 
to be that they had such a good high school, why did

18:31.154 --> 18:39.226
they want to come to the white high school that had 
more people and was older, not well-equipped? Was

18:39.247 --> 18:40.989
it separate but equal? It was equal. In what ways? 
Equal facilities. Probably... 90% of the black

18:50.318 --> 18:58.188
students going to Horseman High School did not 
want to go because they realized that they were not

18:50.318 --> 18:58.188
wanted there. They realized that. The nine 
students that started it? Well, 90% of the

19:02.793 --> 19:07.179
students at Horseman High School and other high 
schools realized they were not wanted. And

19:07.379 --> 19:09.642
they're no different than anybody else. You don't 
associate people that you don't particularly

19:12.065 --> 19:16.531
feel comfortable with. And they were the same way, 
exactly. But the National Association, what do

19:19.765 --> 19:25.337
they call it now? The NAACP was in its infancy at 
that particular time. And there was a nationwide

19:32.372 --> 19:38.685
movement, one of which was Martin Luther King. 
There was a nationwide movement to do something

19:38.868 --> 19:50.705
about civil rights, and education was where they 
wanted to start, which I did not agree with. I don't

19:50.785 --> 19:57.855
agree with today that you shouldn't take children 
and use them to advance the cause of the people as a

19:57.835 --> 20:08.028
rule. They should have taken grown people if they 
wanted to bring about equal civil rights and not

20:08.068 --> 20:24.568
use children, young children, six, eight, 10, 12, 
up through high school age, And I still remember

20:24.548 --> 20:34.888
that night when the NAACP was organized to do this 
very thing. And this Daisy Bates that you referred

20:34.908 --> 20:42.523
to a while ago, she was the leader. of the local 
community from NAACP. Oh, yeah. She was the

20:46.608 --> 20:47.729
leader. Well, was she a journalist also for a 
newspaper or something? Oh, you don't know? OK. We

20:52.154 --> 20:56.158
don't know that. But they were intent on seeing 
that schools were integrated. The kids could make

21:05.909 --> 21:08.956
a difference. They were satisfied with where they 
were. How were those nine kids selected? Do you

21:12.124 --> 21:13.527
remember? I don't know that. You don't know? I'm 
sure they had to volunteer because they knew there

21:17.015 --> 21:21.105
was going to be some problems. Did you ever meet 
those nine children? Never did. So, but you know

21:26.345 --> 21:35.661
that they, I mean, just from general, I mean, the 
general feeling that no one would want to be placed

21:26.345 --> 21:35.661
in that situation, but did you ever hear... I don't 
think they wanted to. But did you ever hear any

21:36.683 --> 21:44.596
stories about how they felt, if they were scared or 
proud to be the ones to make the difference? I think

21:44.616 --> 21:50.867
at that time, papers, radio and television 
interviewed them and... that they were concerned

21:52.653 --> 21:58.061
and afraid that they would be hurt. Had to be 
because even after the federal government sent in

21:58.081 --> 22:08.936
troops and stayed there for the rest, they stayed 
there the entire term. They stayed there through

22:09.056 --> 22:10.979
June, May of 1958. The troops then? The federal 
troops stayed that long. They were guarded in the

22:17.549 --> 22:21.394
classrooms, and they were guarded when they left 
the school. How were they received by the white

22:21.779 --> 22:24.907
students and the faculty? Was that all a farce 
because of the guards, or were they just not well

22:24.947 --> 22:31.404
received? Students didn't receive, didn't 
welcome the law. Most of them didn't. A handful

22:36.899 --> 22:39.264
did. The faculty mixed. Couldn't do much about it. 
In the lunchroom and places like that, did they eat

22:43.855 --> 22:49.949
separately? At a separate time or just off in a 
group by themselves? Separately. They did that in

22:53.978 --> 22:56.123
order to prevent any trouble. That's a good idea. 
Would you say, then you would definitely say that

22:59.867 --> 23:06.053
these students were even more segregated within 
the white school than they were outside? When we

23:06.774 --> 23:13.861
were talking about Hortzman High School, what 
kind of, did they have a mixed faculty or was it all

23:06.774 --> 23:13.861
black? All black. All black administration and 
everything? Everything.

23:21.169 --> 23:21.689
Okay. What other individuals do you think played a 
big part in the, for or against the desegregation

23:26.545 --> 23:29.231
movement. We mentioned Daisy Bates and Virgil 
Bloom. Blossom. Blossom. You mean locally or?

23:37.350 --> 23:37.771
Well, either.

23:43.243 --> 23:44.626
You mentioned Martin Luther King. I think the... I 
think that the, on the federal government level,

23:46.458 --> 24:12.381
between Richard Nixon and William Rogers, his 
name, he was attorney general, Bill Rogers at that

23:46.458 --> 24:12.381
particular time, they, they expressly felt that 
the Supreme Court ruling was the law of the land,

23:46.458 --> 24:12.381
which was questionable that it was the law of the 
land, and that they were It was their intent to see

24:12.884 --> 24:22.641
that, regardless of what took them, and do it, that 
it was going to be enforced, which was a great

24:12.884 --> 24:22.641
mistake, a great mistake. How do you think they 
should have gone about this whole situation? How

24:26.726 --> 24:28.969
do you think it would have been better or easier? 
Let the individual school boards across the

24:29.950 --> 24:40.000
United States take care of their own plan, and we 
wouldn't have had any problem at all. How long do

24:40.540 --> 24:49.149
you think it would have taken for the, especially 
the southern schools, to be integrated if they had

24:40.540 --> 24:49.149
gone at their own pace or own speed? Faster than it 
took. than it is what it has to last 25 years, 30

24:50.330 --> 24:54.921
years. Because they feel like it's something they 
have to do. Because any time you're forced to do

24:58.008 --> 25:02.879
anything, there's going to be resentment. And 
this was forced down the throats of the people

25:03.761 --> 25:08.372
across the country, north, south, east, and west. 
The North wasn't that different from the South as

25:09.770 --> 25:14.118
far as when it came to forced integration. But they 
try to make themselves seem better. People in the

25:17.805 --> 25:23.897
North were opposed to it more than the people in the 
South.

25:25.261 --> 25:31.710
The only reason the South got the attention 
because that's where, at that time, a great

25:25.261 --> 25:31.710
percentage of the black people lived. There 
weren't that many percentage-wise in the North

25:31.730 --> 25:47.573
and the East and the West, but they were bitterly 
opposed to it and it took them longer to achieve

25:31.730 --> 25:47.573
what degree of integration we have today. You said 
that the Guard stayed until May of 1958? No, no, no.

25:51.741 --> 25:54.285
The National Guard only stayed about a week or so 
until the Federal Troops moved in. Okay, but the

25:54.305 --> 25:55.548
Federal Troops stayed? The Federal Troops stayed 
when Eisenhower ordered Federal Troops in, and I

25:55.568 --> 26:06.388
can't remember how many there were, but they 
stayed until... School term was out in May. By the

26:09.488 --> 26:10.110
following year. And is that when the school was 
shut down that next term? There was no school at all

26:14.024 --> 26:16.975
for two years. There was no high school at all. 
None. Every high school was closed. In Little Rock

26:22.288 --> 26:24.751
or in Arkansas? In Little Rock. Because of the 
problem. How did the faculty and the students feel

26:29.498 --> 26:32.422
about the guards? Did they resent that or did they 
take that resentment that they had for the guards

26:32.462 --> 26:41.995
if there was any out on the black students because 
they were the whole reason that they were there?

26:43.173 --> 27:01.014
Well, I didn't actually talk to faculty members, 
but I'm certain that they did not agree with either

26:43.173 --> 27:01.014
the state or the federal government getting 
involved in the school administration properly,

26:43.173 --> 27:01.014
because that's strictly a local responsibility. 
The Constitution of the state of Arkansas and

27:01.034 --> 27:11.627
every other state in the union provides 
specifically for how schools are administered.

27:11.843 --> 27:16.128
that a local school board, elected by the public, 
has full responsibility. And the state has no

27:17.289 --> 27:21.835
responsibility, and the federal government has 
no responsibility. His father saw an opportunity

27:21.855 --> 27:36.392
to grab hold of something that was highly, highly 
emotional at the time, and used it to its fullest

27:21.855 --> 27:36.392
extent, perpetuated himself an officer for the 
next eight years.

27:39.095 --> 27:40.697
That was his only purpose. Only purpose. I can't 
believe that. Did people support Faubus's

27:44.928 --> 27:50.578
actions, the state in general, the community? 
Those who didn't support him kept quiet because it

27:50.638 --> 27:57.831
was highly controversial, highly 
controversial. If you publicly pick a position,

27:59.127 --> 28:14.293
which a lot of us did, who because of the position in 
public life had to, then we became controversial.

28:15.215 --> 28:17.659
And you were either... considered to be a pretty 
good fella or you were a pretty bad fella. And it was

28:22.893 --> 28:24.477
decided a lot by that. Absolutely. Was it totally 
by that? Absolutely. I had friends and even family

28:29.309 --> 28:34.382
members that wouldn't speak to me for two or three 
years because of that. They wouldn't speak to you

28:35.392 --> 28:40.681
because they felt differently or because they 
were afraid to speak out in favor of you? Both.

28:41.202 --> 28:41.803
Both? Both. How was your family treated during 
this time? I read an article about a cross being

28:44.227 --> 28:49.777
burned in your front yard, and I know that your son 
went to high school there. Persecuted.

28:50.919 --> 28:51.139
Persecuted. Was it rough? Real rough? Tense? Not 
really. Not really? Not really when you consider

28:55.528 --> 28:57.732
the reason for it. People did things they wouldn't 
have done otherwise. But people in your own

29:01.379 --> 29:11.239
church, in your own circle of friends,

29:01.379 --> 29:11.239
didn't associate with you. They were... I think 
they were really afraid that they would be drawn

29:12.601 --> 29:19.331
into something that was not their business.

29:23.177 --> 29:26.482
I was concerned about it, but not to any great 
degree. Did they not speak to you even to the extent

29:26.502 --> 29:29.727
of saying hi on the streets? No, not even? No, no. 
Some family members. It took a long time to get over

29:33.192 --> 29:34.915
it. I can imagine. Brent's dad was a senior in high 
school. What kind of treatment did he receive?

29:41.710 --> 29:42.651
Well, he didn't know it. We didn't tell him, but

29:43.933 --> 29:49.880
he was guarded everywhere he went. Undercover? 
Oh, yeah. He was guarded everywhere he went from

29:52.523 --> 30:01.333
the time he left the house until the time he got back 
until school was up the following year. Then he

30:01.813 --> 30:05.398
went to the University of Arkansas the following 
fall. Did he receive any flak there from the

30:06.259 --> 30:10.924
students, or he was just another student then? So

30:12.946 --> 30:18.532
how long after your term did you stay in Little 
Rock? Or did you leave because of this? No, no, no,

30:21.195 --> 30:24.419
no. I had decided that, well,

30:24.439 --> 30:34.570
it became controversial, obviously. I decided to 
run for governor and prepared to file.

30:42.545 --> 30:54.544
I realized that because of the position I had taken 
in this matter right or wrong, that the chance of

30:42.545 --> 30:54.544
being elected was practically nil. And so I 
decided against filing for nomination or

30:56.247 --> 31:04.840
election.

31:06.203 --> 31:13.592
I had been thinking some time about moving our real 
estate business to a larger community. And I think

31:13.612 --> 31:29.612
probably

31:13.612 --> 31:29.612
what happened

31:13.612 --> 31:29.612
probably expedited it to some extent because we 
did business statewide.

31:30.959 --> 31:35.467
I couldn't discuss business if we were talking 
about politics. How large was Little Rock at this

31:35.487 --> 31:36.909
time? Little Rock was about, at that time, was 
about 125,000, 135,000 people. But I felt at that

31:42.760 --> 31:53.659
particular time that I had a, because I was in the 
office at the time, I had a moral responsibility. I

31:54.871 --> 32:05.024
had a Christian responsibility and a legal 
responsibility, constitutional

31:54.871 --> 32:05.024
responsibility. And I did what I did because I felt 
that it was right that they were human beings, not

32:05.044 --> 32:14.676
animals, regardless of color.

32:17.719 --> 32:20.743
I felt that the Christian... The true Christian 
would have done what I did, regardless of

32:22.512 --> 32:27.418
consequences. And the Constitutional State of 
Arkansas, and all other states, says that, by law,

32:28.920 --> 32:44.579
that the chief executive of any city, any city, has 
two primary responsibilities. That is to protect

32:45.140 --> 32:48.464
the lives of people and protect property. I had no 
choice. I had no choice. And I knew when I did it that

32:52.786 --> 32:56.913
I had to pay a price, and my family had to pay a price. 
But I did the same thing a little bit. And I didn't

33:00.419 --> 33:01.741
necessarily agree. In fact, I think the greatest, 
one of the greatest tragedies in the United States

33:01.982 --> 33:18.009
in the history of this country was when the Supreme 
Court made the decision to do away with separate

33:01.982 --> 33:18.009
pedigree besides education. I'll always be. You 
believe it should have remained separate but

33:18.908 --> 33:21.491
equal? To this day, I believe. Because of the 
controversy? No, because I think it's the right

33:23.934 --> 33:26.817
thing to do. You can't force people. You can't 
force people to do something they don't want to do.

33:31.042 --> 33:33.565
You can't force people to associate if they don't 
want to. You can't do it. And we forced, when they

33:35.387 --> 33:45.338
made that decision, and they were forcing people, 
black and white, all colors, They were forcing

33:45.908 --> 33:52.836
people to associate, and you can't do it. I think 
you have a choice. I think you should have a choice

33:54.618 --> 33:59.084
to choose who you want to be your friend and who you 
want to be with. You can't legislate by law who your

33:59.104 --> 34:02.608
friends are going to be. And that's exactly what 
it's all about. And to this day, to this day,

34:05.051 --> 34:08.515
they're doing it. Busing, for example, is the 
greatest, most expensive...

34:16.553 --> 34:18.178
thing this country has to do. When you see kids that 
live in a block or two of a school and have to get on a

34:18.899 --> 34:26.589
bus and ride 25 or 30 miles to go to some school, they 
don't want to, you know. Again, you're taking the

34:26.609 --> 34:35.761
children of this country and you're forcing them 
to do something that they don't want to do. That's

34:35.821 --> 34:36.582
not right. It wasn't right then, it's not right 
today. When we get enough men and women with enough

34:39.085 --> 34:48.417
backbone to go to Washington, D.C. and change it, 
you know, then this country will... and take a step

34:48.397 --> 34:50.799
forward and straighten itself out. And we're in a 
heck of a mess today on so-called civil rights. You

34:54.883 --> 34:58.366
mean change busing or change the whole separate 
but equal? That's just one thing. That's just one

34:59.367 --> 35:01.629
thing. I think we've already pressed the point now 
that they're not going to, that we'll always have,

35:01.649 --> 35:15.021
we'll always have, in my opinion now, some type of 
integrated education. By choice or by? Well. It's

35:17.118 --> 35:18.460
been 30 years. I don't think we can go backwards. 
But if we could, if we could legally, and I thought

35:23.206 --> 35:36.183
that there was enough vote in the Senate and House 
two years ago that it was going to happen. But if we

35:36.283 --> 35:45.235
could do it with a bunch of children in distant 
schools and require, make it where... They go to

35:45.772 --> 35:54.571
schools in their community, you know, that we 
would go a long ways toward getting over the

35:45.772 --> 35:54.571
bitterness that we have. And it's there today. 
It's there and it's going to remain there. Do you

35:58.715 --> 36:16.256
feel like the bitterness has recited some that the 
kids my age, like 20 and younger, are less, I mean

35:58.715 --> 36:16.256
much less, a significant amount less bitter than 
the kids that were in high school when you were

35:58.715 --> 36:16.256
mayor? I don't think so. You don't think so? You 
don't think that there's that much difference

36:18.219 --> 36:20.521
between now and then? I know people today that... 
Their children happen to get on buses and ride 10,

36:23.825 --> 36:28.432
15, 20 miles away to school. And not only do the kids 
resent it, but the parents resent it very much. And

36:36.444 --> 36:46.238
if they're in a position financially, many, many, 
many of them are sending their kids to private

36:36.444 --> 36:46.238
schools for that reason. So when people talk about 
desegregation, integration, in the past tense of

36:48.040 --> 36:54.548
something that's been accomplished, you would 
disagree with that? Oh, yes. Most definitely. Has

36:55.990 --> 36:57.892
not been accomplished. And in my opinion, never 
will be accomplished,

36:57.912 --> 37:02.178
100%. So, okay. Because you're forcing people to 
do something they don't want to do. I agree with

37:06.183 --> 37:07.445
you. Do you have anything else that we left out? 
Anything about your views? Well, my views

37:11.910 --> 37:15.735
really...

37:18.685 --> 37:21.830
haven't changed in 30 odd years. I've never said 
anything publicly, as I told you before.

37:28.160 --> 37:33.389
I went for every year for 15 or 20 years. When 
September rolled around, people all over the

37:33.509 --> 37:41.402
country, media of various types, would try to run 
me down. and seek an interview and get public

37:41.382 --> 37:45.371
statements, and I refused to do it. And still 
would. And still would. I know when I think the 25th

37:49.339 --> 38:00.403
anniversary occurred here two or three years ago.

38:03.775 --> 38:15.488
I had, out of New York and California, major 
television personnel trying to come to Houston

38:03.775 --> 38:15.488
and interview me. And see how your views have 
changed, if at all? I haven't said anything

38:19.313 --> 38:28.643
publicly, and

38:19.313 --> 38:28.643
I've moved to a different district. After you left 
Arkansas, did you move to Houston? Yes. And set up

38:32.304 --> 38:34.086
your business there. And then did you live out here 
at Madisonville for a while? I mean, y'all had a

38:39.894 --> 38:41.476
house over that. We have a ranch up here, a horse 
ranch, and we released the place in January of 82.

38:52.030 --> 38:56.496
And the intent was to build a house here and to live 
here and still have my business operation in

38:57.320 --> 39:03.051
Houston. I had an accident and it became 
impossible. But I will eventually do so. Move back

39:09.683 --> 39:10.604
to Madisonville? Do you have anything else? Did I 
forget anything? Do you have anything to say about

39:15.093 --> 39:19.401
the people or the organizations? Anything that 
we... Maybe we didn't elaborate on enough. The

39:23.321 --> 39:30.511
organizations, even the white citizens' 
councils, did they, and the Ku Klux Klan? Well, of

39:30.531 --> 39:35.838
course, the Ku Klux Klan has been, they've been all 
based on day one, you know. They were such a radical

39:36.139 --> 39:46.834
group that

39:36.139 --> 39:46.834
they should have never existed. The NAACP, not 
quite as bad, but to some extent so biased that

39:48.215 --> 40:08.113
their real purpose for formation and even Martin 
Luther King, the same kind of a situation, you

39:48.215 --> 40:08.113
know, the same kind of a situation. I think the very 
fact that he's eulogized as such a national hero

40:08.093 --> 40:31.671
today is because

40:08.093 --> 40:31.671
he got involved in the stuff that he did and became 
an ineffector, inciting people to do things that

40:08.093 --> 40:31.671
at that particular time were not acceptable, 
trying to rush things too fast.

40:35.178 --> 40:37.301
Do you feel like the black people had had enough? I 
mean, had it up to where they couldn't stand

40:37.682 --> 40:41.267
anymore, and that's why they tried to rush things 
through? They just wanted everything at once? Or

40:43.870 --> 40:44.992
do you just feel like they... I know there's only a 
handful of people, percentage-wise, in any given

40:45.633 --> 40:54.385
cause that will...

40:56.693 --> 41:13.551
become involved to the extent that they give their 
organization or their particular race a bad name,

40:56.693 --> 41:13.551
whether it's civil rights, whether it's 
organized labor, or this, this, or that, or so

40:56.693 --> 41:13.551
forth and so on. There's only a handful of people 
that are troublemakers. By and large, a great

41:17.575 --> 41:24.743
majority of people are reasonable and sensible, 
and they won't get out in front I think that applies

41:27.018 --> 41:32.432
to the Key question plan, the NAACP, and so forth. 
Okay. You can't think of anything else, can you?

41:36.162 --> 41:36.222
No. Thank you. You're welcome.
