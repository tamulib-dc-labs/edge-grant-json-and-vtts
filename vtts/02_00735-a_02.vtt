00:03.895 --> 00:13.544
So over the years, the Aggie players have 
developed a fairly sound financial basis. I think

00:13.564 --> 00:14.184
so. On their own. I think so, yes. They, I assume, 
own their own equipment. Oh, yes. You have

00:20.850 --> 00:22.752
lighting, sound equipment. Oh, yeah, we've got 
quite a bit of lighting equipment. But we're

00:26.716 --> 00:33.582
working quite closely now, or I presume this next 
year, and they're going to work very, very closely

00:26.716 --> 00:33.582
with us. people over there in the center. In fact, 
we've been working rather closely with them this

00:37.702 --> 00:40.987
last year. We do some shows in the forum and we do, I 
did a show and two shows in the auditorium, the 750

00:42.188 --> 00:52.502
seat auditorium. My last show was over there, Play 
It Again Sam. That's the last show that I directed

00:55.265 --> 00:57.789
here at A&M. I want to tell you something about 
that, not that it's important or not, but the first

00:57.809 --> 01:04.277
play I did here back in 1950, kind lady, a young 
fella here named Harry Gooding, who was then a

01:04.831 --> 01:11.983
student in the Department of Architecture. And he 
played in that play. And when I was getting ready to

01:13.947 --> 01:28.392
do Play It Again Sam,

01:13.947 --> 01:28.392
he called me and he wanted to know if, for 
sentimental reasons, he could play in this last

01:13.947 --> 01:28.392
show that I was going to do before I retire. Well, 
the Aggie place right now is open only to students.

01:33.081 --> 01:41.170
No faculty, no... Now, right now, he's working 
down there in the architect system building. But I

01:41.190 --> 01:46.255
thought that was a nice gesture for him to ask to be 
in my last show. And so he played in my last show and

01:47.016 --> 01:50.839
also in my first show. He played Humphrey Bogart in 
the last show. He played the role that Humphrey

01:55.044 --> 01:58.227
Bogart had played in Sand. Well, that would be, I 
would think, quite an honor to you to have one of

01:59.270 --> 02:11.643
your former people come back, and particularly 
one from your first show that would want to have a

01:59.270 --> 02:11.643
role in your last show. Well, Harry and I have known 
each other for a good many years, and we're pretty

02:12.705 --> 02:16.929
good friends. He was with me for a long, long time, 
about ten years, I guess, before we turned it over

02:16.949 --> 02:23.837
into an all-students. All-students. Yeah. Why 
was it decided to turn it into an all-student

02:25.983 --> 02:31.474
organization? It would seem you would have had 
good success with student and outsiders. Well,

02:38.528 --> 02:41.173
I'll tell you the reason for that. Well, when we 
turned it into an all-student organization, at

02:42.200 --> 02:51.557
that time, women were not admitted to A&M. But we 
had quite a bunch of people in there. And

02:56.046 --> 03:05.423
personally, I don't think that faculty and 
students work together very well for any length of

02:56.046 --> 03:05.423
time in A&M. in an organization like that, where 
you have to work so close. I just don't think it

03:10.897 --> 03:12.518
works well. Now, we've never had any men on the 
faculty. We've had quite a few women, but they work

03:20.085 --> 03:25.429
quite well with the young lads. You know, we've had 
awfully nice ones. I want to say one thing right

03:29.133 --> 03:32.255
now, and I want to get this on the tape. I've been 
running this thing for a good many years. And we

03:38.528 --> 03:46.061
don't have any funny stuff going on in the Aggie 
players as an organization. Not while they're

03:46.081 --> 03:47.624
around me. They know the word is out. Nobody comes 
around me while they've been drinking. All they

03:56.880 --> 03:59.945
got to do is pass by me and they're out. Now, I don't 
care whether anybody likes that or not. But that's

04:03.267 --> 04:07.614
the first step in deterioration of a theater 
group. You know, theater people don't have a very

04:07.674 --> 04:12.442
good reputation in this country. They're looked 
upon as sort of theories and funny people. But

04:17.771 --> 04:18.973
that's one thing. And I have had, we've had a few 
little problems over the years, but they were

04:20.315 --> 04:29.410
settled and settled very, very quickly. And I'll 
tell you something else. I had one boy that I put

04:31.870 --> 04:40.547
out, and he came back within a year, and he said, may 
I come back in? I said, yeah. He got back in, and he

04:44.194 --> 04:47.320
eventually became president of the 
organization. But he got erected. Well, I would

04:51.361 --> 05:04.338
imagine particularly where you have an 
organization that's primarily student males and

04:51.361 --> 05:04.338
some faculty wives, you would have to run a pretty 
tight operation so as to not have problems. I tried

05:04.718 --> 05:08.583
to run a tight organization. And I think I was 
fairly successful with it. Well, I don't think I

05:11.867 --> 05:16.153
have ever heard anything other than good things 
about the Aggie players. Well, I'm happy to hear

05:18.735 --> 05:19.896
that. And I want to add one other thing here. Over 
the years, I have never had anybody from the

05:23.639 --> 05:40.313
administration or anybody from the faculty claim 
that I chose and did a show that was not fit to be

05:23.639 --> 05:40.313
done. I mean by that, a dirty show. Never. Now 
that's something. And I'm very proud of that. And

05:50.212 --> 05:55.398
many of the administrators have come to see our 
shows. And you know what I mean by the

05:56.139 --> 05:58.742
administrators. They've come to see our shows 
over the years. And I have never had one call me on

06:02.427 --> 06:10.457
the phone, write a letter, or anything that they 
objected to the show. I did have one time, many,

06:12.074 --> 06:15.918
many years ago, I did what was a command decision. 
That was a war show. And I did have one instructor

06:17.920 --> 06:24.007
come up to me the next day, and he said, my wife 
thinks that's a very awful show. Well, there was a

06:24.307 --> 06:26.749
couple of dams and a couple of hells in it. Well, 
these generals were in this little place, and

06:26.769 --> 06:32.475
these guys were flying over there dropping bombs. 
Now, you know they weren't going to say tut-tut.

06:36.159 --> 06:36.400
Yeah, yeah. And I, you know, I didn't... But I will 
not allow in any script of mine that I do any

06:38.365 --> 06:47.420
reference to a deity unless it's a lawful 
reference. You understand? Some of these funny

06:49.003 --> 06:51.406
little lines they throw in there. I could go on, but 
it might mess up your microphone. I won't go into

06:54.151 --> 06:55.553
detail. But if I do not see that it adds anything to 
the script, I'm going to alter it or change it, and I

06:56.234 --> 07:04.508
don't think that's going to hurt the author 
because he's not going to know anything about it.

07:04.927 --> 07:13.505
But a lot of these, and I won't say this word over 
this microphone, but a lot of these, you know,

07:04.927 --> 07:13.505
hitting your thumb. I've taught my kids, you know, 
instead of an expletive, they can get a lot more

07:13.946 --> 07:24.268
bleeding out of the audience by silencing. You 
understand what I'm talking about? Huh? Well,

07:27.978 --> 07:31.120
that's what I do with those kind of funny, stupid 
things they're having in. Now, you notice, you

07:31.901 --> 07:38.026
watch TV a little, and you notice that they're 
getting a few hells and dams in there now. Huh? I

07:38.987 --> 07:39.528
don't think. I'm not a Puritan, my friend. I'm not a 
Puritan. I know that happens all the time. I do it

07:44.732 --> 07:45.813
myself. But I don't see the need for that, really, 
when you come right down. However, I will say

07:49.757 --> 07:53.880
they're very clever in placing these things today 
in their script. Very clever about it. But, well, I

07:55.484 --> 07:59.689
didn't want to get that annotated. Now, what these 
kids do when they leave, I don't know. I can't

08:05.717 --> 08:06.718
control that. But when they're working for me, 
brother, I control that. And I tell them there's

08:12.405 --> 08:15.248
three things that make, you know. I want them to 
have some fun. Fun and work. You see? Those are the

08:24.323 --> 08:27.207
two things that will produce a good show. Idea, 
people, and space. That's what theater is all

08:31.934 --> 08:33.556
about. And that's the only three requisites you 
need. Idea, people, space. You can do a show in a cow

08:39.564 --> 08:43.009
fashion. You don't need a building. And that's 
what I've laid the premise, that's the premise of

08:45.172 --> 08:49.318
my theater work. Well, I think that would be a 
premise for an awful lot of things. Simplicity.

08:58.461 --> 08:59.202
That's the thing. Simplicity.

09:02.647 --> 09:11.400
So frequently today, not only in theater, but in 
many other things, schools and everything,

09:02.647 --> 09:11.400
there's so much emphasis placed upon the 
facility. Yes, yes. We do too many things for these

09:12.762 --> 09:15.706
kiddos today. Let them do these things 
themselves, make their own mistakes. They learn

09:20.551 --> 09:21.532
that way. When they build a flat, I'll give them the 
blueprint, let them go at it. And when they get it

09:26.999 --> 09:28.821
all through, I'll look at it.

09:32.245 --> 09:33.967
I'll say, you see that cornice down there? Mm-hmm. 
I'll say, well, look at your blueprint. Oh, I got it

09:37.271 --> 09:39.174
on wrong, haven't I? I'll say, yeah. I'll say, now, 
make it again. They cost me money, but it's worth

09:43.479 --> 09:45.581
it. In the long run, they learn that way. They 
learn. and they'll stretch a canvas on a flat, and

09:49.508 --> 09:53.894
they'll glue-size it. And I'll watch them. 
They'll stretch it, you know, pretty tight, and

09:54.896 --> 10:03.107
they'll glue-size it, come back in three hours, 
and there'll be a big split up the middle. I said,

10:03.127 --> 10:04.109
how'd that happen? I said, did you read the 
instructions on the blueprint there? No. I said,

10:09.817 --> 10:11.960
well, you go back and read the instructions. He 
really said, leave it limp a little before you

10:11.980 --> 10:16.807
glue-size it. I said, now that'll... Well, glue 
size is what you put on to fill the little holes in

10:18.162 --> 10:24.398
this cheesecloth stuff before you paint it, see? 
Yeah. That's the way. That's the way. Experience.

10:28.127 --> 10:30.633
My kids learn theater by doing theater. By doing 
it. Among the Aggie players, then, each play you

10:34.683 --> 10:45.681
produce, you have the entire cast, the technical 
crew, and they build the set. Absolutely. They do

10:46.823 --> 10:50.810
all the work under our supervision. You see, they 
take courses. And incidentally, anybody that's

10:52.713 --> 11:00.927
taken a theater arts course must, at least this has 
been the way I've run it since I was... ran director

11:01.852 --> 11:09.966
of the thing, they must participate in a current 
and live show some way or other. They build a flat

11:10.687 --> 11:23.488
or, you know, work on a crew, one of the crews, 
lights, flats, painting, publicity, or acting or

11:10.687 --> 11:23.488
something, costuming. So being in the Aggie 
Players is almost a requirement, in a sense, to

11:24.245 --> 11:33.514
being in the theater arts section. No. Anybody can 
join the Aggie Players, but they don't have to take

11:35.856 --> 11:39.740
theater arts. What I mean is, if you are in theater 
arts, though, you must be in the Aggie Players.

11:44.144 --> 11:44.624
That's right. That's what I'm trying to get 
across. Well, you must be in a show. And how do you

11:49.149 --> 11:50.530
get in the Aggie Players? You just walked in and 
say, I want to be an Aggie Player. I say, all right,

11:52.512 --> 11:53.593
you're in. That's all. No dues, no anything. And 
they can get out just as fast. They can either quit

11:59.020 --> 12:11.768
themselves or be absolutely...

11:59.020 --> 12:11.768
You're talking about being in the Aggie players, 
and I think you mentioned something about you have

11:59.020 --> 12:11.768
officers... No more. We stopped being one of those 
things a long, long time ago because we spent so

12:13.708 --> 12:18.856
much time doing it. We go from one show to another. 
So you don't have any officers or anything? No, we

12:23.163 --> 12:25.387
don't have meetings anymore. You did? Once we did, 
once we did, yeah. And then did the organization

12:29.333 --> 12:34.802
then have something to say in what place you put on 
and that sort of thing? Well, to be honest about it,

12:35.575 --> 12:37.858
no. I've chosen a play. I figured I knew more about 
what a good play was than a 19-year-old kid. Let's

12:44.125 --> 12:46.828
be honest about it. I've never had them complain 
about a show.

12:53.856 --> 12:57.821
If they didn't like the play that I chose, they 
didn't have to show up for casting. No, I... Well, I

13:02.238 --> 13:04.321
mean, after all. Well, there's a great deal to be 
said for experience. Yeah. However, I've

13:10.549 --> 13:13.273
listened. I listen to these kiddos. I figure that 
any good teacher, if he can't learn from his

13:15.336 --> 13:24.308
students, is not a good teacher. I don't care if 
he's 16 years old. True. Listen, I think one of our

13:27.712 --> 13:31.097
problems today, we don't listen to these kids. 
Every once in a while, they come up with a good idea.

13:34.129 --> 13:36.152
And if they do, my golly, let's use it. There's a gap 
right there, as far as I'm concerned. They go, wow,

13:41.199 --> 13:42.622
that kid doesn't know anything. He hasn't lived 
long enough. Well, he may have something on the

13:45.065 --> 13:48.130
ball. And if he does, heck, let's listen to him 
anyway.

13:53.879 --> 13:55.521
We've been talking a great deal about the Aggie 
players. We talked about some of the other things,

13:55.541 --> 13:59.447
primarily creative dramatics and premier 
players. What led you to start those two programs?

14:08.993 --> 14:11.499
I don't know. I generally have an answer, if 
anybody can ask me. I just can't put my finger on it.

14:18.535 --> 14:24.022
Well, the premier players, I noticed that there's 
a bunch of them. Several years ago, these high

14:24.282 --> 14:28.908
school kids didn't have too much to do. They didn't 
want to work. You know, today, when we have a hard

14:30.129 --> 14:36.437
time getting kids, they've got to go out and get a 
job. But here they were, horsing around, fooling

14:36.457 --> 14:43.086
around, and I thought, well, let's work up a 
theater group for them, give them something to do.

14:43.126 --> 14:44.207
We work them every day. Mm-hmm. And they do the same 
thing the Aggie players do. They work on it every

14:47.554 --> 14:50.176
afternoon. They're building flats. They may be 
acting, building flats and painting this and

14:51.318 --> 14:57.824
doing that and playing with electricity and so 
forth. We teach them a good deal of good theater

14:57.844 --> 15:01.208
work in there. Well, you would have to if you do two 
plays in the summer. Yeah, that's right. And

15:04.952 --> 15:07.475
they're two full-length plays. And they're not 
crummy plays either. We do good plays. No, do... Do

15:13.137 --> 15:18.282
you have some kids work in both plays, or do you just 
split up the group? No, we do one play the first

15:18.862 --> 15:23.286
month and then another play the next month. We have 
two sessions. Do some kids participate in both

15:25.148 --> 15:29.071
sessions? Oh, yeah. We have mostly repeaters. 
They get in on the first one morning. They sign up

15:34.056 --> 15:35.237
for the second. In fact, this last summer we had 
more in the second half than the first half. Do you

15:38.660 --> 15:41.102
have many repeaters from year to year? Yes, you'd 
be surprised. We do. We have quite a few repeaters.

15:47.203 --> 15:53.151
We had one kiddo came in, one kid I remember from 
downtown there. He came in creative dramatics

15:53.171 --> 16:03.664
when he was about five years old and he went all 
through the creative dramatics and he went all

15:53.171 --> 16:03.664
through the premium players until he got into 
college. Did he carry on with his theater work in

16:04.910 --> 16:07.955
the college? He's a singer, really, what he is now. 
He's studying music. Pretty good boy, too. Have

16:14.745 --> 16:24.179
you had many or any number of people who've been to 
Aggie Players who have gone on to professional

16:14.745 --> 16:24.179
dramatics or professional theater? Wow. Not 
many. Not a few. Do you remember Rick Torn? No. He's

16:34.579 --> 16:36.583
a pretty good actor out in Hollywood now. In fact, I 
think he's over in Spain now, on account of the

16:36.603 --> 16:42.173
income tax or something. But he was an Aggie 
player, and then he went down to the University of

16:42.193 --> 16:47.864
Texas, and he was quite successful in New York. He 
was very successful in Hollywood. and uh then

16:50.793 --> 17:18.572
there's some other people i don't know if we need to 
name them we've had several and there's several

16:50.793 --> 17:18.572
people i worked with at baylor when i was directing 
some shows up there for baker clue guliger for one i

16:50.793 --> 17:18.572
saw him last night in a movie blue he's been very 
successful in new york and he's very successful

16:50.793 --> 17:18.572
out there in hollywood he does a lot of tv work very 
good actor terribly good actor i've worked with

16:50.793 --> 17:18.572
him directed him and i've worked in shows with him 
too by the way even at my advanced age then.

17:23.747 --> 17:31.255
But it's been a great deal of comfort and a great 
deal of fun for me, and I'm going to miss it. You said

17:31.275 --> 17:34.639
you did some shows at Baylor. Was this, this would 
be during the summer while you were working on a

17:35.399 --> 17:42.687
master's degree? They have up there, or did have, 
what they call summer stock. It was the first

17:46.840 --> 17:50.601
collegiate summer stock company in this part of 
the country. and you'd go up there and put out so

17:51.307 --> 17:59.098
much money and go to school and then you'd get so 
much back at the end of summer if and when and so

17:51.307 --> 17:59.098
forth. But it was a lot of fun. They had some pretty 
good people up there too. You had a good faculty.

18:04.926 --> 18:07.449
Can you tell us a little bit about your graduate 
work at Baylor? Was that done entirely in the

18:08.190 --> 18:10.173
summers? Uh-huh. And your major work is what? Your 
major field for the masters?

18:20.197 --> 18:20.678
English. English. Yeah. With a specialty in 
theater. Oh, I have two master's degrees. Yes. Oh,

18:26.083 --> 18:27.225
I see what you mean. Yes, yes. I have a master's 
degree in English, English crit, and a master's

18:27.905 --> 18:33.171
degree in theater. I did them in the summer. So did 
you have to write two theses? Mm-hmm. What was your

18:39.558 --> 18:40.239
first? The first thesis in English was the 
Francesca di Rimini motif in... plays. I traced it

18:51.075 --> 18:52.697
down in plays. That's in the fifth canto of Dante's 
Alighieri's Inferno, the Paola and Francesca

18:52.717 --> 19:03.509
love story. And I traced it, tried to trace it, to 
see how many plays had been written. And strangely

19:09.055 --> 19:13.660
or late, I only found nine, and none of which were 
Too good. And this was done at Baylor? Mm-hmm. And

19:18.440 --> 19:20.704
what year did you receive that degree or do you 
remember? I can't remember. I can't remember. I

19:24.571 --> 19:27.195
was an old man when I did that. I think I was in, I 
don't know. I can't remember. But it was, so it was

19:31.102 --> 19:33.166
then it would have been? 59, wasn't it? Or did I get 
the other one? I can't remember, tell you that.

19:38.815 --> 19:44.081
Well, anyway, after that master's in English, you 
went back and got a second master's in theater.

19:44.101 --> 19:44.942
Yeah, yeah. And what was your thesis in that field? 
The theater work at Texas A&M College. Oh, I can

19:53.051 --> 19:55.013
remember the date on that. That was 1960, because 
that's as far up as it is. The second master's was in

19:58.557 --> 20:00.179
1960. Yeah, it ended. Yeah, yeah.

20:07.690 --> 20:08.091
Okay. Sound like 1949. Was that right? That would 
have been for the first one. I don't know. I think we

20:14.559 --> 20:17.923
probably can find that out if we need to. Of course, 
in addition to being director of the Aggie

20:19.726 --> 20:28.377
Players, you've been the voice of Kyle Field for a 
goodly number of years. I believe that also was

20:28.477 --> 20:32.182
1950, was it not?

20:33.764 --> 20:35.807
How did you happen to become that? It's a strange 
story. They were having a playoff game here on a

20:37.591 --> 20:43.657
high school level, Class AA, I can remember that. 
And Ray Williams out of Austin phoned up here and he

20:44.818 --> 20:50.743
wanted some officials to do the ballgame. And so 
they chose officials. I went to the meeting and

20:52.084 --> 20:57.589
they said, let's broadcast it out of the stadium. 
And they had then a little place about as wide as

20:57.609 --> 21:04.815
this desk, a little wooden shack down on that end of 
the stands on the west side and west side yeah

21:05.977 --> 21:33.537
that's where the press box is it's on the south end 
of the west side and somebody there I don't

21:05.977 --> 21:33.537
remember who it was I remember the officials I met 
one of them yesterday and we had a little talk about

21:05.977 --> 21:33.537
that ball game 25 years ago and so I did that high 
school game And I guess a few people heard me, and I

21:34.158 --> 21:38.584
forget who the coach was here now. Was it either Ray 
George or Harry Steitler? Steitler, I believe

21:45.432 --> 21:46.594
it's Steitler. Harry, I believe. And Bill Dayton 
was here at the time as a trainer, if I recall

21:48.176 --> 21:52.221
rightly. And he came up to me in August sometime and 
asked me if I'd do the college game. And I said, yes.

21:59.707 --> 22:02.089
And that was all there was to it. I mean, I've never 
had a contract with them or anything to that

22:02.250 --> 22:08.436
effect. It was a request of the athletic 
department. Yes, yeah, yeah, yeah. That you did

22:13.100 --> 22:19.667
the

22:13.100 --> 22:19.667
voice of Kyle Fitts. Yeah, the voice of Kyle Fitts. 
You know, I kind of liked that. Well, it gives you

22:25.998 --> 22:31.066
some contact with a different set of people. Yeah. 
Well, I coached football for quite a few years. I

22:35.493 --> 22:38.898
refereed football for quite a few years. I 
belonged to the SFOA. And that's how I got into this

22:41.863 --> 22:46.029
athletic business. I've been fiddling around in 
athletics either as a player or a coach. spectator

22:54.263 --> 22:57.587
or announcer for about 50 years. I've done 
everything in athletics. You said you were a

23:00.611 --> 23:08.461
member of SFOA in the conversation chapter for a 
number of years. At what level did you officiate

23:09.762 --> 23:12.306
games? High school and junior college. which must 
have been a pretty busy life for you during the

23:17.720 --> 23:22.505
football season. Well, I gave up a lot of football 
games for the players, I'll tell you that. I was

23:26.770 --> 23:27.351
going to say. Oh, yeah. Well, the players came 
first to me, and I, you know, pick up a buck or two

23:28.091 --> 23:34.038
here. That wasn't so important to me as my 
organization, the players, which I felt and will

23:34.138 --> 23:42.447
feel until the 31st of August is mine. Mm-hmm. 
Well, I think you have every right to feel that way.

23:46.060 --> 23:47.221
You know, it's a strange thing. I used to, not too 
long ago, I'd go out around the country making

23:47.341 --> 24:03.119
little talks to groups of people, and invariably 
I'd be introduced as the voice of Kyle Field. I used

24:04.140 --> 24:05.602
to get a little kick out of that. But the thing is 
this. For just a few hours a year, I perform over

24:13.222 --> 24:14.545
there. Nothing was ever said of the hours and the 
hours and the hours that I spent teaching theater

24:15.207 --> 24:22.985
and doing theater work. You know how little things 
get stuck to you like that? Isn't it funny? That

24:29.500 --> 24:31.264
must be some kind of a... on our society. Well, 
yeah, I suppose, though, it's a few hours a year,

24:35.413 --> 24:39.922
but then... I hit a lot of people. You have a lot of 
thousands of people. Yeah, I hit a lot of people. At

24:45.152 --> 24:48.038
one point, at one time. Over a single football 
season, you probably get as many people hear your

24:48.018 --> 24:59.193
voice as in several years of theater. Well, of 
course, they don't hear your voice at all. Only

25:03.618 --> 25:08.064
those people who are involved in the Aggie 
players, I guess, hear your voice. That's right. I

25:09.719 --> 25:24.501
venture to say probably that any number of those 
people who hear you at the football games are not

25:09.719 --> 25:24.501
even aware of the fact that you are director of the 
Aggie players. They don't know who I am. And it's

25:25.843 --> 25:28.187
well that they don't. After all, the people come to 
see a football game. They come to see the players

25:31.652 --> 25:34.176
play ball. They don't come to hear me. I just happen 
to be an adjunct to the ballgame, that's all.

25:44.146 --> 25:46.851
But you will be continuing in that capacity? I have 
been asked by the athletic department to continue

25:46.871 --> 25:59.892
as the voice of Kyle Field, and I told them I would be 
very happy, the good Lord willing.

26:04.310 --> 26:11.778
How close of a contact with the athletic 
department have you had during your announcing? I

26:11.798 --> 26:21.008
mean, obviously you have to know somewhat more 
about the players than the average spectator who

26:11.798 --> 26:21.008
comes. Well, I go over there on rare occasions. As a 
social visit. And in the next few days, I'm going

26:31.175 --> 26:44.233
over and I'm going to get hold of the defensive 
coach and I'm going to have him show me their

26:31.175 --> 26:44.233
defensive lineups, the various defenses that 
they go into. Then I'm going to get their offensive

26:45.054 --> 26:52.785
lineups, how they run the ball, and I'm going to 
know where these different players are. And

26:54.247 --> 26:55.649
that's about it. That's about it. I don't bother 
them. They don't bother me. In other words, I don't

27:04.802 --> 27:09.327
go there and tell them how to run their football 
club. They love that, I guess. We have very

27:12.612 --> 27:15.595
friendly relationships, very friendly. But as 
you say, people come to see the ballgame, not hear

27:15.615 --> 27:18.799
you. That's right. So your role as the announcer, 
Kyle Field, is considerably different than

27:19.640 --> 27:27.490
the... television broadcast of the game. Oh, yes, 
yes. I work on this theory. The less I say up there,

27:32.119 --> 27:34.809
the better. And I've held that idea for 50 years, 25 
years. Why should I keep saying, well, now this

27:40.210 --> 27:45.922
quarterback is scratching himself. He's under 
the ball. They can see he's under the ball. I don't

27:50.351 --> 27:54.600
have to tell them it's a first down and 15 yards to 
go. They can see that on the scoreboard. I don't

27:57.126 --> 27:58.168
have to tell them. where the ball is on what line it 
is. They can see that. I used to have to when they

28:02.060 --> 28:04.783
didn't have a scoreboard. You know, a fellow way 
down here, and he balled me on the five. I said, the

28:07.646 --> 28:09.328
ball is now on the five. He couldn't see down there. 
He didn't know where it was, even in the field or

28:11.350 --> 28:13.713
not. But they got all that stuff on the board. I 
don't have to tell them that anymore. But they

28:18.558 --> 28:21.962
can't tell who's carrying the ball half the time. 
And they don't, you know, there's a lot of things

28:22.600 --> 28:26.065
they don't see. They don't see a nice block. 
There's one thing about this football that does

28:28.189 --> 28:31.253
bother me a little. You know, the center of the 
offensive team does more work than any other one

28:31.273 --> 28:40.127
man on the ball club. He has to do three things, four 
things. He has to pass the ball to the quarterback

28:43.532 --> 28:47.578
when he's up there hand to hand. He has to pass the 
ball for a place kick, and then he has to pass the

28:47.913 --> 28:52.680
ball for a punt. Now, those are three entirely 
different things. And on every single offensive

28:55.243 --> 29:04.816
play, he has to block somebody, at least one or two 
men.

29:07.640 --> 29:12.507
Now, the other play, you know, you see this fellow 
prancing off here, just floating out there.

29:12.547 --> 29:13.969
Nobody touches him or nothing. He's a decoy, you 
know. But that poor center, that son of a gun is

29:16.583 --> 29:22.155
right in the middle of the hellhole of Calcutta, 
and he catches it every single play. And he's got a

29:28.079 --> 29:29.160
blocker. He does that for defense. He'd get killed 
if he doesn't. He catches it worse when he centers

29:33.345 --> 29:41.115
for the punt or the place kick because he's stirred 
upside down. Yeah, that poof. And you know, you can

29:43.297 --> 29:48.784
seldom mention a fella's name over the PA. You see? 
Very real. The only time he gets mentioned is if he

29:50.182 --> 29:53.253
snaps the ball over somebody's head. No, I won't 
mention that. No, no. Yeah. I don't say you, but in

29:56.444 --> 29:58.431
most... No, I wouldn't. In the print, he would. In 
most... No, I think it was perfect. No, I shouldn't

30:03.560 --> 30:04.922
say that. In those broadcasts or televised... I 
think they talk too much, to tell you the truth. I

30:08.827 --> 30:11.070
really do think they talk too much. Is this perhaps 
a carryover from radio when they were trying to

30:11.090 --> 30:15.115
describe the game? No, I think it's a case of these 
fellows are so in love with their voice and they

30:15.215 --> 30:22.846
love to hear themselves so much they just got to 
keep talking. I shouldn't say that, probably, but

30:23.386 --> 30:26.310
that's the way it appears to me. And I don't know. 
I... Because watching it on TV is different than

30:29.534 --> 30:33.857
being in a stadium.
