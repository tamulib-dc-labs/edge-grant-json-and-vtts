WEBVTT

00:00:02.377 --> 00:00:20.936
This is Tuesday, February 26th.

00:00:22.517 --> 00:00:30.325
We're at 1108 Neil Pickett, and I have the pleasure of interviewing an old friend, Leo Berner.

00:00:30.845 --> 00:00:38.233
To introduce yourself to a listener or a reader, let's begin with a biographical introduction.

00:00:39.815 --> 00:00:43.378
Born, growing up, what did family do, where did you go to college?

00:00:43.959 --> 00:00:49.985
Take us all the way from beginning to the time you got ready to come to A&M.

00:00:51.707 --> 00:00:56.312
Well, I was born in Pasadena, California.

00:00:57.912 --> 00:01:06.926
and I was born in Pasadena because the bridge between Pasadena and Azusa washed out in a flood, and my mother was in Pasadena.

00:01:08.648 --> 00:01:21.588
I went to Citrus Union High School, whose colors were orange and lemon.

00:01:21.608 --> 00:01:24.713
I graduated from Citrus in

00:01:26.735 --> 00:01:31.060
Wow, I can't remember.

00:01:32.221 --> 00:01:36.747
And then I went to Citrus Junior College for two years.

00:01:37.728 --> 00:01:39.390
Then I went to Pomona College.

00:01:40.791 --> 00:01:45.657
Graduated from Pomona College in 1943 and went into the Navy.

00:01:46.418 --> 00:01:47.078
Majored in?

00:01:47.839 --> 00:01:49.762
Oh, I majored in zoology.

00:01:50.643 --> 00:01:56.269
Had a minor in physics and a minor in geology.

00:01:56.603 --> 00:02:03.192
Now, Pomona was then, as it is now, a highly selective, high-quality liberal arts college?

00:02:03.733 --> 00:02:03.873
Yeah.

00:02:04.014 --> 00:02:08.981
Their enrollment then was exactly what it is now, about 1,200.

00:02:10.022 --> 00:02:25.885
But the minor in physics was a little bit peculiar because I knew I was going in the Navy, so I took navigation, which was in the astronomy

00:02:29.476 --> 00:02:41.069
So I had a minor in physics with only taking one true physics course.

00:02:41.089 --> 00:02:59.230
After I got out of the Navy, I went to Claremont College, which is a graduate school which draws people from Pomona and Scripps and Harvey Mudd and the various

00:03:00.087 --> 00:03:02.813
colleges of the Oxford and the Orangeville.

00:03:05.839 --> 00:03:14.316
While I was there, Dr. Roger Revell from the Scripps Institution came around recruiting people

00:03:15.562 --> 00:03:21.552
And halfway through my master's degree, I changed majors and went to Scripps Institution.

00:03:22.293 --> 00:03:23.334
Almost lost my wife.

00:03:23.595 --> 00:03:26.840
All right, changed majors from what to what?

00:03:26.860 --> 00:03:35.033
Well, I was getting a secondary education degree, and I changed to oceanography.

00:03:35.574 --> 00:03:42.345
And I got two degrees in oceanography from UCLA.

00:03:43.135 --> 00:03:45.241
and was on the campus four times.

00:03:47.508 --> 00:03:53.787
Scripps was in La Jolla and was a department of UCLA.

00:03:54.155 --> 00:03:56.638
I could complete all my residency there.

00:03:57.399 --> 00:04:00.684
Now officially it was Scripps, the Scripps Institute?

00:04:01.425 --> 00:04:02.246
Institution.

00:04:02.827 --> 00:04:04.208
Scripps Institution.

00:04:04.228 --> 00:04:06.772
It's an institution run by its inmates.

00:04:10.116 --> 00:04:16.585
Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution and Scripps Institution.

00:04:17.628 --> 00:04:24.337
are often called institutes by people in the press, mainly.

00:04:24.698 --> 00:04:26.740
And you mentioned bride.

00:04:27.041 --> 00:04:28.423
You all had gotten married when?

00:04:29.043 --> 00:04:30.565
Got married in 1947.

00:04:30.886 --> 00:04:35.472
And was this a hometown girl that you had grown up with?

00:04:35.833 --> 00:04:35.973
Yeah.

00:04:36.734 --> 00:04:41.040
She was one year behind me in high school.

00:04:42.341 --> 00:04:45.846
I knew her, but I didn't pay much attention to her.

00:04:46.197 --> 00:04:57.071
When I got back from the Navy, my cousin said she was the only girl in town that wasn't married.

00:04:57.091 --> 00:05:01.957
So I started going out with her and ended up marrying her.

00:05:01.977 --> 00:05:02.257
All right.

00:05:02.357 --> 00:05:08.044
So you do your master's and then PhD at Scripps.

00:05:08.064 --> 00:05:08.705
At Scripps.

00:05:08.865 --> 00:05:09.566
Majoring in?

00:05:10.267 --> 00:05:11.909
Oceanography.

00:05:11.929 --> 00:05:15.934
But your special area of specialization?

00:05:16.252 --> 00:05:17.794
Zoplankton.

00:05:17.814 --> 00:05:18.355
What?

00:05:18.375 --> 00:05:20.839
Zoplankton.

00:05:21.259 --> 00:05:22.601
Spell it for the typist.

00:05:22.862 --> 00:05:28.050
Z-o-o-p-l-a-n-k-t-o-n. All one word.

00:05:28.550 --> 00:05:28.871
One word.

00:05:29.151 --> 00:05:30.393
How did you come to pick that?

00:05:35.421 --> 00:05:36.262
I'm not sure.

00:05:38.605 --> 00:05:43.052
I was introduced to Martin Johnson, who was

00:05:44.483 --> 00:05:48.048
a copepod expert, C-O-P-E-P-O-D.

00:05:50.211 --> 00:05:51.133
He introduced me.

00:05:51.153 --> 00:05:53.656
I went down twice visiting.

00:05:54.317 --> 00:05:59.845
The first time, he introduced me as Mr. DeWitt, which is my middle name.

00:06:01.368 --> 00:06:05.153
And the next year, he introduced me as Mr. Berner.

00:06:06.936 --> 00:06:13.866
And the fellow he introduced me to said, yeah, there's a guy here last year who looked just like you.

00:06:17.288 --> 00:06:27.623
That person became one of, he and his wife became one of our closest friends.

00:06:27.643 --> 00:06:30.407
That's interesting.

00:06:33.051 --> 00:06:37.858
From Scripps, I went to the U.S.

00:06:37.918 --> 00:06:41.162
Fish and Wildlife Service and I worked there for a year.

00:06:42.064 --> 00:06:44.427
Then I went back to Scripps as

00:06:47.782 --> 00:07:01.422
And I took a summer off to teach at the University of Oregon at Coos Bay at their Marine Lab.

00:07:01.442 --> 00:07:09.153
And I had a position of temporary acting assistant professor, which I didn't think sounded very prominent.

00:07:10.195 --> 00:07:14.481
But while I was there I was offered a job at National Science Foundation.

00:07:15.811 --> 00:07:27.663
in the education division, so I went to the National Science Foundation and stayed there for three years.

00:07:29.505 --> 00:07:35.611
And then I started looking for a job.

00:07:35.631 --> 00:07:41.937
The National Science Foundation just didn't tickle my appetite,

00:07:43.840 --> 00:07:47.844
But I did go from a GS-7 to a GS-13 in one year.

00:07:49.045 --> 00:07:50.646
It was a pretty good job.

00:07:50.666 --> 00:07:53.469
Anyway, I was offered three jobs.

00:07:54.329 --> 00:08:08.062
One at Boston College, which is right down in the middle of, no, Boston University, I'm sorry, which is right down in the middle of Boston.

00:08:08.082 --> 00:08:12.666
And I just didn't like that.

00:08:13.726 --> 00:08:28.706
One at Florida State, and I visited there just before a front came through and it was drizzly and rainy and not very attractive.

00:08:28.726 --> 00:08:32.711
I got to A&M just after that front had come through.

00:08:32.751 --> 00:08:36.216
It was a gorgeous, cool day.

00:08:36.336 --> 00:08:41.623
As far as you know, how did you and A&M make any contact?

00:08:42.025 --> 00:08:57.002
Well, Willis Pequenot, who was then department head, asked me to come to A&M, and I came as an administrative scientist.

00:08:57.322 --> 00:08:58.283
Now, this was what year?

00:08:58.303 --> 00:09:00.766
1964.

00:09:01.007 --> 00:09:08.455
Officially, A&M records show me coming in 65.

00:09:09.616 --> 00:09:25.693
I don't know what an administrative scientist was, or is, or ever was, but I came with the understanding that I would get a faculty appointment the next year.

00:09:26.894 --> 00:09:33.100
And this was an understanding with Andy Suttle, who was then academic vice president.

00:09:33.340 --> 00:09:37.885
That's S-U-T-T-L-E. Yeah.

00:09:39.738 --> 00:09:44.686
Pequenot is P-E-Q-U-E-G-N-A-T.

00:09:46.048 --> 00:09:49.573
Anyway, the...

00:09:49.794 --> 00:09:51.857
But how did he know about you?

00:09:52.598 --> 00:09:54.461
Who called your name to him?

00:09:54.481 --> 00:09:57.546
He was a faculty member at Pomona.

00:09:58.347 --> 00:09:59.269
Pequenot was?

00:09:59.289 --> 00:09:59.809
Yeah.

00:09:59.829 --> 00:10:00.751
Oh, okay.

00:10:00.771 --> 00:10:04.917
Then he, I don't know, he bounced all around.

00:10:05.378 --> 00:10:07.281
And he was at NSF for a while.

00:10:08.999 --> 00:10:10.441
And then he came here.

00:10:11.402 --> 00:10:16.489
Did you get phone calls or letters before you came to visit?

00:10:20.134 --> 00:10:20.775
Phone calls.

00:10:21.456 --> 00:10:21.556
Okay.

00:10:21.576 --> 00:10:25.982
Did you come for an interview visit where they looked at you and you looked at them?

00:10:26.824 --> 00:10:26.924
Yeah.

00:10:26.944 --> 00:10:31.170
What was your impression when you first saw what was here?

00:10:31.690 --> 00:10:35.175
Well, I really didn't.

00:10:35.797 --> 00:10:38.521
have much of an impression of the university itself.

00:10:38.641 --> 00:10:55.305
I was here one day, and I think we went to Tom's Pre-Camp, and then I talked to some people in the department, and it was subtle.

00:10:55.326 --> 00:11:05.280
I went back to NSF, got the offer, and we drove from Virginia to

00:11:06.543 --> 00:11:12.733
to College Station, took three days, snowed all the way.

00:11:13.114 --> 00:11:13.594
Oh, my.

00:11:13.995 --> 00:11:15.057
All three days.

00:11:16.099 --> 00:11:22.409
And my wife kept asking, what's College Station like?

00:11:23.731 --> 00:11:30.502
And when we got to Calvert, I said, it's just about like this.

00:11:30.522 --> 00:11:33.006
She broke into tears.

00:11:34.387 --> 00:11:41.996
When we got to College Station, it did look a little better than she expected, although there was no downtown.

00:11:42.056 --> 00:11:44.079
This is the only salary question.

00:11:44.479 --> 00:11:46.642
What was your beginning salary?

00:11:46.662 --> 00:11:47.944
I don't have the biggest idea.

00:11:48.004 --> 00:11:51.928
Oh, you don't?

00:11:51.948 --> 00:11:52.970
I can't remember.

00:11:52.990 --> 00:11:56.974
And that first year, you said you were not officially a part of the faculty.

00:11:57.115 --> 00:11:57.575
That's right.

00:11:58.256 --> 00:11:59.678
And your title was what?

00:12:00.759 --> 00:12:03.162
Administrative scientist.

00:12:04.002 --> 00:12:07.306
Does that partly mean that you were on research money?

00:12:09.649 --> 00:12:19.021
No, I was on the department budget, and I was supposed to administer things.

00:12:19.782 --> 00:12:23.867
Well, for example, everybody that had a research grant

00:12:36.824 --> 00:12:39.627
one thing.

00:12:39.647 --> 00:12:59.071
Anyway, after that first year, the department, then department head, which was Pequenot, recommended me for a faculty position and reminded Suttle that he agreed to that.

00:12:59.411 --> 00:13:02.815
And Suttle said, I didn't agree to that.

00:13:02.835 --> 00:13:04.958
Well, about that time,

00:13:06.203 --> 00:13:17.619
I don't know what happened to Suttle, but Wayne Hall, who was academic, let's back up.

00:13:18.620 --> 00:13:34.742
In the interim, we got a new dean in geosciences by the name of Horace Byers, and when Equinoct went to him,

00:13:35.617 --> 00:13:38.961
He said, well, I'll do some checking.

00:13:39.141 --> 00:13:52.697
And he called a professor that I had at Scripps, who I'd saved from making a fool of himself a couple of times.

00:13:52.717 --> 00:13:56.882
A wheel had been hit by a destroyer and drifted into the

00:13:57.301 --> 00:14:04.729
and he had said it from the description the reporter gave him.

00:14:05.490 --> 00:14:14.880
He'd said it was a sperm whale, and I was standing there waving my arms because I didn't get to look at it, and it was a gray whale.

00:14:16.702 --> 00:14:25.131
And then I collected some amphioxus for him and various things that sort of endeared myself to him.

00:14:25.786 --> 00:14:33.515
And he gave me a high recommendation, and Dr. Byers went ahead with my faculty appointment.

00:14:33.635 --> 00:14:35.037
You were an assistant professor?

00:14:35.497 --> 00:14:35.998
Associate.

00:14:36.018 --> 00:14:36.779
Associate professor.

00:14:37.900 --> 00:14:39.662
Describe the department.

00:14:40.924 --> 00:14:42.946
Who were the people that were here then?

00:14:43.006 --> 00:14:45.029
Where were the strengths in the department?

00:14:45.049 --> 00:14:46.330
Who were the well-known folks?

00:14:49.574 --> 00:14:51.276
The department was about how many people?

00:14:52.557 --> 00:14:55.641
Oh, gosh, I can't even think.

00:14:56.549 --> 00:14:58.671
El Said was here.

00:14:58.732 --> 00:15:02.916
Bob Reed, who I had thought of, was here.

00:15:02.956 --> 00:15:07.201
Dale Leeper.

00:15:08.543 --> 00:15:13.609
That's L-E-I-P-P-E-R. Chipping away behind the scenes.

00:15:15.231 --> 00:15:22.219
At that time, meteorology was combined with oceanography.

00:15:22.520 --> 00:15:28.829
Bill Clayton, who later became president at UTB Alveston, was here.

00:15:30.411 --> 00:15:45.473
We used to go, our offices were all in Goodwin Hall, and we'd go down and sit and talk with Bill Clayton and look through the cracks in the walls

00:15:46.043 --> 00:15:47.765
see people walking by.

00:15:47.785 --> 00:15:53.290
You couldn't see all the people, but you could see people through the cracks in the walls.

00:15:53.931 --> 00:16:00.978
Goodwin Hall was, when I came, all the file cabinets had to be north and south.

00:16:00.998 --> 00:16:02.880
If they're east and west, they'd fall open.

00:16:04.462 --> 00:16:14.312
And they put steel bars through the building and some big things to keep the walls from falling apart.

00:16:16.385 --> 00:16:21.852
And every once in a while, there'd be a big thunk and things would jerk.

00:16:21.872 --> 00:16:25.536
When we got a new Xerox machine, they weren't sure the building would hold it.

00:16:27.338 --> 00:16:29.080
It was an interesting place.

00:16:29.100 --> 00:16:35.007
What kind of office and laboratory facilities did you get at the start?

00:16:35.608 --> 00:16:45.700
At the start, I had an office that was about 8 by 12.

00:16:47.570 --> 00:16:56.801
It had a window air conditioner in it that was so big that it would freeze you, but it would never dehumidify.

00:16:58.123 --> 00:17:06.593
I remember distinctly it was room 103 in Bazell Hall.

00:17:08.155 --> 00:17:11.339
Buildings and grounds people came around and renumbered all the rooms.

00:17:13.902 --> 00:17:16.665
The men's room was right next to my

00:17:17.320 --> 00:17:24.686
office and they named it 103 and they renumbered my office 103A.

00:17:26.088 --> 00:17:33.554
So, my, all the graduate students put a sign on 103A to enter it through 103.

00:17:36.597 --> 00:17:47.226
So, anyway, that, that went along for a very short time and then George Coonsey asked me

00:17:47.915 --> 00:17:51.861
to come to the Graduate College as an assistant dean.

00:17:51.881 --> 00:17:57.870
But before you do that, let's go back to talking about the department and so forth.

00:17:59.773 --> 00:18:06.683
What kind of status did the oceanography have here on a national basis when you came?

00:18:09.970 --> 00:18:12.333
I can't honestly answer that, Haskell.

00:18:12.454 --> 00:18:15.458
But Woods Hole and Scripps would have been the...

00:18:15.538 --> 00:18:18.122
They were the one and two.

00:18:18.222 --> 00:18:18.522
Yeah.

00:18:18.563 --> 00:18:21.126
But would we have been considered a big leaguer?

00:18:22.488 --> 00:18:24.531
Or were we a beginner beginner?

00:18:25.152 --> 00:18:35.387
Well, we were on a par probably with Washington and Oregon and Florida State.

00:18:37.510 --> 00:18:40.194
I think that's probably still the case.

00:18:40.214 --> 00:18:41.656
I'm not sure.

00:18:41.676 --> 00:18:44.580
But are you saying we would have been in the top ten?

00:18:48.386 --> 00:18:50.529
Yeah, we were probably in the top ten.

00:18:50.549 --> 00:18:55.757
We turned out more students, PhD students, than anybody.

00:18:55.777 --> 00:19:02.787
At that time, what were the department's predominant strengths?

00:19:03.247 --> 00:19:05.070
What areas of specialization?

00:19:06.333 --> 00:19:13.102
Physical was the biggest strength, and still is, in my opinion.

00:19:14.664 --> 00:19:22.474
Biological was probably next, although geology was strong.

00:19:24.697 --> 00:19:32.687
And chemistry was just so-so.

00:19:33.008 --> 00:19:36.272
Who were the most respected scholars in the department?

00:19:37.248 --> 00:19:56.729
Probably Bob Reed, and I can't remember when, who came, and that sort of thing, but Worth Nowlin certainly was a well-respected person.

00:19:56.749 --> 00:19:58.652
That's K-N-O-W-L-I-N?

00:19:59.232 --> 00:20:03.717
No, N-O-W-I-N. N-O-W-I-N.

00:20:03.737 --> 00:20:03.877
Okay.

00:20:06.480 --> 00:20:07.221
Nowlin.

00:20:08.399 --> 00:20:19.877
And Syed El-Syed grew a big reputation

00:20:24.042 --> 00:20:28.747
and primarily in Antarctic work.

00:20:29.968 --> 00:20:35.434
I won't say much more about that.

00:20:35.855 --> 00:20:41.621
Where and the research facilities on the Gulf were where?

00:20:43.263 --> 00:20:48.008
We docked our ship in Galveston.

00:20:48.747 --> 00:20:51.970
down in commercial docks.

00:20:55.833 --> 00:21:05.802
There was one restaurant bar where you could always find the crew members if you couldn't find them on the ship.

00:21:06.362 --> 00:21:18.012
Then, as they developed UT Galveston, we moved on our ship operations over there.

00:21:18.211 --> 00:21:25.442
Now, the program here in oceanography had begun after World War II?

00:21:28.206 --> 00:21:31.311
Actually, it began during World War II, I think.

00:21:33.755 --> 00:21:41.687
Well, we had our 50th anniversary about three years ago.

00:21:42.713 --> 00:21:44.396
Late 40s.

00:21:44.436 --> 00:21:46.779
40s, yeah.

00:21:46.799 --> 00:21:46.920
Right.

00:21:46.940 --> 00:21:50.465
And the course offerings were graduate.

00:21:50.645 --> 00:21:53.450
There were no undergraduate degree in oceanography, was there?

00:21:53.750 --> 00:21:54.391
No.

00:21:54.411 --> 00:21:56.014
And there still is.

00:21:56.034 --> 00:22:05.508
By and large, when you came, where did the A&M graduate students in oceanography, where had they done their undergraduate work?

00:22:06.610 --> 00:22:07.031
All over.

00:22:07.331 --> 00:22:10.476
All over?

00:22:11.890 --> 00:22:22.784
We had students from Denton, and we had students from California colleges.

00:22:23.966 --> 00:22:25.748
Were there many international students?

00:22:25.768 --> 00:22:29.794
Yes, there were quite a few international students.

00:22:29.814 --> 00:22:30.034
Where?

00:22:30.054 --> 00:22:31.256
Primarily Chinese.

00:22:32.617 --> 00:22:35.761
There were very many Indians, a few.

00:22:37.724 --> 00:22:40.007
And your first teaching assignments were what?

00:22:42.063 --> 00:22:42.764
What courses?

00:22:44.245 --> 00:22:44.785
What areas?

00:22:46.527 --> 00:22:57.817
Well, research was the big one, and then oceanography 620, which was marine zooplankton.

00:22:57.837 --> 00:22:58.697
Marine zooplankton?

00:22:59.918 --> 00:23:00.479
Is that what you said?

00:23:00.519 --> 00:23:01.680
I think so.

00:23:02.921 --> 00:23:05.343
I can't even remember the name of the course.

00:23:05.823 --> 00:23:08.486
What was your impression of the quality of the students?

00:23:09.407 --> 00:23:11.108
The quality of the students was very good.

00:23:12.404 --> 00:23:16.636
And I think that's been borne out by where they've ended up.

00:23:17.940 --> 00:23:25.481
And was it clear that you were expected to develop your own research funding sources?

00:23:26.464 --> 00:23:27.848
Yes.

00:23:28.250 --> 00:23:33.415
That got all messed up by the fact that I went over to graduate college as a part-time dean.

00:23:33.435 --> 00:23:34.937
But before that time, yeah.

00:23:35.297 --> 00:23:38.661
Well, it wasn't much before that.

00:23:38.961 --> 00:23:45.608
By and large, where did the oceanography funding, research funding come from?

00:23:47.390 --> 00:23:50.854
Our biggest source of funding was the Office of Naval Research.

00:23:51.855 --> 00:23:54.898
There was some funding from National Science Foundation.

00:23:55.975 --> 00:23:58.738
That's about it.

00:23:58.758 --> 00:24:04.745
Now in this part of the United States, where else were there similar programs?

00:24:07.448 --> 00:24:09.670
Florida State would have been the only one.

00:24:09.750 --> 00:24:10.071
Okay.

00:24:10.672 --> 00:24:12.053
Nobody else in Texas then?

00:24:12.834 --> 00:24:13.795
LSU not then?

00:24:13.815 --> 00:24:18.220
Not then.

00:24:18.419 --> 00:24:23.386
Port Aransas Lab, University of Texas was a summertime thing.

00:24:24.107 --> 00:24:33.139
Was there any programs in oceanography that clearly was the model that A&M was using?

00:24:34.441 --> 00:24:36.484
Was it trying to be kind of like?

00:24:36.804 --> 00:24:38.667
No, I don't think so.

00:24:38.687 --> 00:24:40.149
A&M was doing its own thing.

00:24:41.010 --> 00:24:46.958
And, you know, that's the thing that bothers me.

00:24:47.596 --> 00:24:52.343
Was it planned 2000 or no?

00:24:52.363 --> 00:24:52.584
2020.

00:24:52.604 --> 00:24:53.866
2020.

00:24:54.587 --> 00:25:03.420
They're all trying to emulate somebody, and they don't look at A&M's strengths and build on them.

00:25:05.403 --> 00:25:11.072
To think that A&M should emulate MIT is absolutely absurd.

00:25:11.812 --> 00:25:19.343
When you first came, who were your first good friends, professional friends?

00:25:21.946 --> 00:25:26.292
Bill Clayton was one.

00:25:26.312 --> 00:25:31.299
I was trying to think who in the world.

00:25:32.281 --> 00:25:36.627
There were three of us, and I can't think of who the third one was.

00:25:39.551 --> 00:25:41.093
It's pretty bad.

00:25:42.457 --> 00:25:45.302
And that trio, what did you all do together?

00:25:46.304 --> 00:25:47.726
Oh we'd go to lunch together.

00:25:48.087 --> 00:25:48.668
Where?

00:25:49.049 --> 00:25:50.591
At Sabisa Hall.

00:25:50.611 --> 00:25:53.256
Or what's the other one?

00:25:54.078 --> 00:25:54.438
Duncan?

00:25:54.639 --> 00:25:58.305
Duncan.

00:25:58.741 --> 00:26:07.551
Oh, and we used to go to the MSC, too, because Wayne Stark had a very good restaurant over there.

00:26:07.571 --> 00:26:10.534
As a matter of fact, it was the best restaurant in town.

00:26:12.055 --> 00:26:15.699
What was, as you and your, did you have children yet?

00:26:16.360 --> 00:26:20.164
Yeah, we had two when we came.

00:26:20.324 --> 00:26:26.571
When you came, describe finding a place to live.

00:26:28.306 --> 00:26:38.743
We rented a place on Dominick Drive, which the department had found for us.

00:26:39.985 --> 00:26:46.877
And we lived there a year, and that year we built this place.

00:26:46.917 --> 00:26:48.099
Do you remember what it cost?

00:26:48.119 --> 00:26:53.267
$250 a month.

00:26:54.378 --> 00:27:03.619
What was your impression, your family's impression of College Station as you settled in?

00:27:04.521 --> 00:27:12.859
Well, one daughter, the one who was in eighth grade, really didn't move.

00:27:17.480 --> 00:27:25.074
The younger daughter really got into things and got involved.

00:27:27.398 --> 00:27:40.703
I think my daughter, who was in the eighth grade, coasted through the whole eighth grade because the schools they'd attended in Virginia were

00:27:43.079 --> 00:28:12.225
much much advanced than what was in college station at that time now my ear understood you to say that your older daughter didn't move what well she moved but oh mentally oh oh okay i see what you mean i see what you she still was with her friends back then and what did y'all how easy was it to make friends in the community uh we made a lot of friends

00:28:13.015 --> 00:28:24.353
up and down the street, and a church, but beyond that we didn't make many friends in the community.

00:28:24.373 --> 00:28:25.174
At which church?

00:28:26.115 --> 00:28:27.337
A&M Presbyterian.

00:28:28.479 --> 00:28:30.602
Were you Presbyterians before you came?

00:28:30.663 --> 00:28:31.664
Yes.

00:28:31.684 --> 00:28:33.507
Okay, so that was a natural.

00:28:33.527 --> 00:28:39.917
Describe that church then.

00:28:42.530 --> 00:28:46.616
It was an interesting place, I guess.

00:28:46.817 --> 00:28:57.333
The pastor was one that had been here quite a while.

00:28:59.115 --> 00:28:59.896
Was it Anderson?

00:29:00.598 --> 00:29:05.465
No, it was Fisher.

00:29:06.687 --> 00:29:07.067
Fisher?

00:29:07.288 --> 00:29:08.149
Fisher.

00:29:09.158 --> 00:29:20.173
And anyway, I ended up on the diaconate.

00:29:20.193 --> 00:29:25.520
And they wanted to remodel the church.

00:29:27.082 --> 00:29:33.310
So they spent $50,000 to get an architect's plans to remodel the church.

00:29:35.113 --> 00:29:39.098
Then went ahead and did it on their own, at which point

00:29:39.989 --> 00:29:42.352
I resigned from the church.

00:29:44.375 --> 00:29:46.758
$50,000 down the drain.

00:29:46.818 --> 00:29:49.641
About how big was the congregation then?

00:29:51.023 --> 00:29:56.470
Oh, it must have been about 100, I can't say.

00:29:56.490 --> 00:29:57.731
It was full of...

00:29:57.751 --> 00:29:58.993
Located at Northgate.

00:30:00.555 --> 00:30:00.675
Yeah.

00:30:00.695 --> 00:30:07.043
And they, what, a few years ago sold that for

00:30:08.069 --> 00:30:13.036
private dormitory and got a lot of money.

00:30:14.078 --> 00:30:15.760
It's now part of another church.

00:30:17.483 --> 00:30:26.837
After I left the Presbyterian Church I was so fed up with organized religion I didn't

00:30:27.425 --> 00:30:41.282
church for four or five years and then we started going to first presbytery in berlin what other uh in the community what other things did y'all get involved in early

00:30:43.709 --> 00:30:54.425
Well, there was a quasi-faculty club in the Ramada Inn that we got involved in.

00:30:55.306 --> 00:31:05.020
Which then, the Ramada Inn over on the northeast corner of the campus at... University.

00:31:05.040 --> 00:31:05.961
In Texas.

00:31:05.981 --> 00:31:08.305
Texas, yeah.

00:31:08.325 --> 00:31:11.910
And we were in the band boosters that consolidated.
