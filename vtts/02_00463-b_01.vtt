WEBVTT

00:01.027 --> 00:08.514
And I did realize that I had come to regard the 
Vietnamese as maybe less than human. Maybe not all

00:08.534 --> 00:10.135
the time, but at times. And

00:11.777 --> 00:15.740
I didn't like that myself. And so I think I felt some 
of the guilt for that. And maybe that was too much

00:20.104 --> 00:22.907
guilt. But I know it contributed to the way I felt 
going home about what I've been a part of. Because I

00:29.967 --> 00:34.735
had seen myself as strictly in the medical nursing 
role. And I felt that was necessary and

00:35.757 --> 00:44.051
commendable.

00:45.814 --> 00:50.862
But also, people at home were very much aware of me 
live. And I think I did get a question about that. So

00:58.705 --> 01:00.387
I think people looked at me differently. They 
looked at all of us. They looked at the uniform, I

01:01.708 --> 01:04.531
think. And saw that whole thing was different, 
less honorable than it had been. And how did the

01:09.576 --> 01:11.478
people treat you? Like, people at home? Did 
they...

01:17.764 --> 01:18.745
They were glad to have me home. They were? I had 
extended three months. I spent 15 months over

01:22.368 --> 01:26.232
there, which was three months longer than the 
usual tour. And that had hurt my folks, had worried

01:27.224 --> 01:32.731
them. And my mother, well, she read my letters very 
carefully and deciphered my handwriting. My

01:39.460 --> 01:41.362
handwriting didn't look real normal to her. Then I 
was, something was wrong. They were real

01:46.068 --> 01:48.411
relieved. What about other veterans? Was there a 
problem with being a woman? the woman veteran with

01:56.519 --> 01:58.842
the men veterans? At that time? I'm not sure who I 
was around, at least in that first six months, that

02:02.206 --> 02:16.504
was a veteran, other than a friend that I'd had 
before going over and while I was over, and then we

02:02.206 --> 02:16.504
saw each other after I was back. I

02:16.584 --> 02:26.256
think everything was fine with us. We didn't have 
to talk about it. He knew what I'd gone through. He

02:32.501 --> 02:39.031
had walked through pre-op and recovery once 
during a mass cow situation. And I think his

02:39.051 --> 02:54.032
esteem, I mean, I don't think he really

02:39.051 --> 02:54.032
recognized feelings of esteem toward me before 
that, but I think he did afterwards.

02:55.447 --> 02:57.870
But others, I don't think I was around any others. 
There were guys from my class in high school who

03:00.192 --> 03:05.919
went, but I didn't see any of them during that time. 
Then when I went back into the Army, I stayed out. I

03:10.785 --> 03:22.278
got back in December and went back on active duty in 
June, I think. Went back to El Paso where I'd been

03:22.298 --> 03:24.120
before. And there were still people there I knew. 
One of them was this Jimmy, who had been over with

03:28.146 --> 03:37.262
the weapons project.

03:37.883 --> 03:39.225
And this other friend.

03:44.935 --> 03:46.918
I don't think there was any change in the...

03:54.053 --> 04:06.372
I don't remember any outstanding, any 
remarkable,

03:54.053 --> 04:06.372
anything remarkable to say about it. Okay. And I 
know you were involved with, talk about the

04:06.512 --> 04:18.330
network of other females who were in Vietnam that 
you kept up with. Yeah.

04:21.560 --> 04:23.322
I must have continued writing. I must have written 
to some of the girls I had known over there. Because

04:28.549 --> 04:45.272
once I was

04:28.549 --> 04:45.272
living in San Francisco, and that was two years, 
probably two years after I was back, I got together

04:28.549 --> 04:45.272
with some of them for the first time. And these, for 
the most part, were girls who lived in the same

04:45.312 --> 04:48.456
hooch. It was the Red Cross girl across... across 
the hall. Her brother was an MIA, and she had gone

04:54.080 --> 05:09.584
over, had not been in the Red Cross, but had gone 
over, had joined, thinking that if she could get

04:54.080 --> 05:09.584
over there, she could find out something about 
him. And the gal who lived next to me,

05:09.604 --> 05:19.039
and a couple of others, and those two I've seen 
recently, you know, in the last, well, I've talked

05:20.943 --> 05:30.899
to by phone and one of them I've seen. And

05:30.919 --> 05:39.714
I think, you know, we'll continue to see each 
other. The one I've supported, well, and it's been

05:39.754 --> 05:47.406
both ways. But when we first really made contact 
again, we lost touch for a couple of years. And at

05:54.526 --> 06:00.293
that point, she was going through losing her 
father, who was very, very sick. And then soon he

06:00.313 --> 06:03.416
died. And there was some other things going on. And 
there was a parallel there. And I was able to help

06:09.624 --> 06:17.393
her in the healing process. Because what I had gone 
through had been very recent. She was going

06:22.196 --> 06:24.739
through something, you know, right now. And then 
also there was, you know, the stuff in the past. The

06:28.462 --> 06:31.865
same kinds of things that I had done in the past. And 
I had started working through that. And so, you

06:33.527 --> 06:37.370
know, there was some sharing.

06:39.592 --> 06:46.519
I've always kept in touch with a girl that I was in 
college with who went into the Army Student Nurse

06:39.592 --> 06:46.519
Program the same time I did. And we see each other 
every three or four years and write,

06:47.815 --> 07:05.419
talk on the phone. I'd like to know more, you know, 
people with the same experiences here.

07:16.674 --> 07:17.755
There are some in the the Dallas area, but I'm not 
connected with anyone that I, you know, feel a real

07:18.123 --> 07:29.077
rapport to. And there are times when,

07:29.197 --> 07:37.108
well, there's a lot of times, frankly. I wish more 
people had been through what I have been through,

07:37.388 --> 07:46.059
who know what I know. You know, I feel that's a heavy 
burden for me.

07:52.767 --> 08:04.179
blessing that more people don't know, but still.

08:04.199 --> 08:12.568
What were your views of the war before you went, and 
what were your views after you came home? Before,

08:12.588 --> 08:22.538
I didn't like war, but I saw it as necessary in 
certain instances. And I think I felt, like many

08:23.041 --> 08:36.960
people did, that communism had to be contained and 
so on and so forth.

08:36.980 --> 08:42.007
For some time after I got back, I didn't think much 
about it at all. I was real relieved when it was

08:42.027 --> 08:45.832
over. And it was over in time for my husband not to 
have to go. He was a doctor and would have gone.

08:51.813 --> 09:00.642
except he was in training, and his training lasted 
longer than the war did. And next I thought, about

09:02.403 --> 09:17.919
the time that was ending and he was finishing his 
training, we started our family, and I had a son,

09:02.403 --> 09:17.919
and if I thought of it at all, I thought, well, you 
know, that's over. And it was like, that's over,

09:19.140 --> 09:21.482
and there won't be any others. instance

09:22.559 --> 09:50.237
and

09:22.559 --> 09:50.237
when I started I think going started the healing 
process myself I realized how bad it was the cost of

09:22.559 --> 09:50.237
the war made much more of an impact than I had before 
what happened was I started the healing and the

09:22.559 --> 09:50.237
grieving over the boyfriend over the 
relationships.

09:58.058 --> 10:02.822
I was involved more than once, romantically, 
while I was there. But either he went, he left, you

10:04.223 --> 10:09.368
know, rotated home, or I did. And it was just over. I 
mean, this was not something that could continue.

10:13.853 --> 10:21.760
And I had gone over promising myself, because, you 
know, when you're 23, marriage is on your mind.

10:22.027 --> 10:23.710
Mm-hmm. Promising myself that I would not marry 
somebody I met over there. I knew this was going to

10:27.595 --> 10:41.095
be an artificial time, and that, um, probably 
would not be a good time and place to be making, you

10:27.595 --> 10:41.095
know, a lifetime decision. But still, you just 
don't turn off a relationship.

10:47.865 --> 10:48.146
And yet I did. Over and over. Mm-hmm. And, um, this

10:52.283 --> 10:56.990
boyfriend who was killed. I didn't go through his 
funeral. When I got over there,

10:59.714 --> 11:05.543
I went to work right away. One of the first nurses I 
talked to was someone a little younger than I whose

11:05.563 --> 11:19.725
boyfriend had just been killed while she was in 
country. I don't think she was on duty, but he came

11:21.629 --> 11:28.159
through our emergency

11:21.629 --> 11:28.159
room. And she was bearing up. And we thought, well, 
you know, my loss wasn't as great as hers. We

11:38.113 --> 11:41.578
weren't engaged.

11:43.786 --> 11:47.330
You know, that was a silly judgment to make, but 
that's the way I operated. And then I just, you

11:47.350 --> 11:51.175
know, got busy doing what I had to do. Never broke 
down in front of patients. And then at home, you

11:55.541 --> 12:04.452
know, after I get off duty, instead of breaking 
down, I go to the officer's club and drink and

11:55.541 --> 12:04.452
dance. I mean, I didn't sit there and, you know, 
just drink. We danced and we flirted and we carried

12:12.271 --> 12:39.831
on I mean we just played and played hard but the 
energy and the emotion you know was spent counter

12:12.271 --> 12:39.831
to the way it should have been

12:12.271 --> 12:39.831
so when I started working through all this I 
started working through the grief of it and cried

12:12.271 --> 12:39.831
like it had just happened

12:43.068 --> 12:50.755
And then realized, you know, the whole thing was 
just so wasteful. It was for nothing. And by then it

12:51.897 --> 12:56.941
was being talked about as nothing, or had been for 
some time. And was, you know, very angry. Angry at

12:59.984 --> 13:00.965
our government. Very distrustful of

13:01.446 --> 13:06.471
our government. I mean, I don't trust anything the 
government says. I really don't. I don't trust

13:10.535 --> 13:12.096
anything I read in the newspaper. I look at it and I 
wonder what really happened.

13:21.126 --> 13:37.027
The beginning of this greeting began with a 
conversion experience

13:21.126 --> 13:37.027
coupled with the baptism of the Spirit.

13:37.307 --> 13:41.813
Something Catholics don't expect to have happen. 
just haven't grown up in that you know but that

13:44.324 --> 14:12.441
tradition hadn't haven't been part of a 
charismatic group whatever so it was very

13:44.324 --> 14:12.441
surprising when it happened and it happened as a 
healing really a healing gift over something that

13:44.324 --> 14:12.441
had happened in our parish and what had happened 
there there were some sudden losses i mean there

13:44.324 --> 14:12.441
was a big big uh turn around in one of the ministries 
and people were gone and something was no longer

14:12.860 --> 14:19.349
there that had been there for me. Something 
without warning. And it was upsetting me

14:23.154 --> 14:25.438
terribly. And then this happened and it was all 
alright. And then a couple months later something

14:27.481 --> 14:37.334
happened which caused me to flash back to start 
remembering Vietnam. And I realized what

14:37.354 --> 14:41.280
happened was that healing was just the beginning. 
of a healing process that I would go through.

14:48.786 --> 14:52.751
This thing at church, it mirrored what had 
happened before. The sudden losses, the losses

14:52.771 --> 14:59.920
with no explanation, no chance to say goodbye. And 
so it's feelings that come out that trigger these

14:59.940 --> 15:07.449
flashbacks. And for me, the flashbacks were... 
not violent, I had not been through anything that

15:10.319 --> 15:17.988
was violent to my person at least, but I just 
started remembering. I remembered, you know,

15:18.529 --> 15:22.113
some of those stories I told you about pre-op and 
recovery. I hadn't thought about those in years.

15:26.098 --> 15:28.360
Some of the stuff I hadn't remembered at all. You 
know, things just started coming back. And with

15:32.746 --> 15:34.808
all of that, with you know, with this conversion 
too, you know, seeing things differently, seeing

15:36.391 --> 15:53.657
things through the eyes of Christ as we should, 
then you look at war entirely differently.

15:53.677 --> 15:56.160
You know, I'm very opposed now to that.

16:01.348 --> 16:05.174
There was nothing just about what we were involved 
in. There was nothing just about We haven't had a

16:06.985 --> 16:12.372
just war in an awfully long time.

16:12.392 --> 16:19.642
Don't talk just war

16:12.392 --> 16:19.642
to me. I've gotten active in the peace movement, 
peace and justice issues.

16:29.547 --> 16:36.517
I just

16:29.547 --> 16:36.517
see things entirely different. You know, I look at 
what we're doing in Central America, in many

16:36.597 --> 16:41.464
places, but Central America especially, you 
know, it's just totally wrong. It's just a

16:41.485 --> 16:43.548
continuation of all of them. It's just,

16:43.568 --> 16:52.381
you know, people in power, I mean, they change. 
Maybe they win. It's good people, but they're...

16:54.893 --> 16:56.976
It corrupts. And then you get a bureaucracy the 
size of ours running away. I don't know how people

17:01.661 --> 17:05.626
can stop it. Did you join Vietnam Vets Against the 
War? Not that

17:12.154 --> 17:15.999
group. And how have your experiences in Vietnam 
affected your life? Like what you do today? What

17:22.888 --> 17:24.430
I'm doing today? Like How do they affect what you do 
now? Well, I think that's why I do peace work.

17:38.619 --> 17:41.042
Things have to change. And those who have been a 
part of something like this have to speak out. This

17:52.133 --> 17:57.119
business of the boy on the striker frame that I said 
reminded me of Jesus on the cross.

17:59.863 --> 18:06.031
The purpose of the cross is so that we will go into 
resurrection.

18:06.051 --> 18:11.658
It has no meaning if we don't go into resurrection. 
And we don't have to find it out for ourselves like

18:11.678 --> 18:15.283
Jesus did. He had no idea what was going to happen. 
He was just plodding along, doing what he thought

18:17.225 --> 18:20.790
he was supposed to do. and not really knowing why. 
That man couldn't know what he was, you know,

18:23.704 --> 18:27.069
doing. And it led him to a bad end. But, you know, he 
was transformed. He woke up with a big shock. We

18:37.063 --> 18:37.945
don't have to do that. We've got that model in front 
of us. We know that these bad things can be turned

18:39.507 --> 18:46.698
around and be transformed. And we have to do them 
because, you know, we're Christ on earth. And so I

18:51.466 --> 18:57.454
believe that very strongly, and that's what I'm 
doing now. I work...

19:01.540 --> 19:08.569
I helped start a justice and peace committee, an 
education committee on justice and peace in our

19:01.540 --> 19:08.569
parish. And I work with an ecumenical women's 
group, Church Women United.

19:18.623 --> 19:20.325
They are involved in... women and children's 
justice issues. And this is international.

19:30.030 --> 19:38.802
They're active at local, state, national, and 
international levels.

19:38.822 --> 19:40.264
And that's exciting to me. Women, I think, will 
make a difference. Men are too hurt, too broken up

19:45.191 --> 19:50.578
themselves. They haven't

19:53.887 --> 20:03.618
I haven't seen what they've done in holding women 
down in this whole patriarchal tradition we've

19:53.887 --> 20:03.618
been a part of. And women are coming out of that via 
the women's movement. And it's a rough time.

20:11.087 --> 20:16.613
There's a lot of animosity among women towards 
feminists. But it's just something that has to be

20:18.115 --> 20:23.421
done.

20:25.291 --> 20:31.159
Women are

20:25.291 --> 20:31.159
primary as caregivers. Men can do this. They can do 
it, and they do do it. Some have done it very well.

20:36.806 --> 20:43.875
But it is in us to do this, and this is the big 
caregiving. We're the ones who, you know, heal the

20:45.477 --> 20:50.944
little fusses at home and keep a neighborhood 
going. And so somehow we've got to make that part of

20:52.831 --> 20:58.979
the overall tradition that we live in. I don't 
think women have to take over. That wouldn't be any

21:00.941 --> 21:04.105
more right than men ruining the world. It would be 
women ruining the world. But it's all a healing

21:10.433 --> 21:15.099
process. The wrongs, the hurts that have been 
done. And as things are healed... they blossom and

21:21.755 --> 21:28.884
they multiply and they're good and they're better 
than they were.

21:28.904 --> 21:31.087
So I think that's what's come out of Vietnam. And, 
you know, if you'd asked me all this seven years

21:31.388 --> 21:45.366
ago,

21:31.388 --> 21:45.366
I wouldn't have had any of this to say, I don't 
think.

21:54.543 --> 22:06.556
The thing that woke me up and started all the 
Vietnam healing was the Beirut bombing. What

22:06.636 --> 22:20.370
happened when someone was injured there, they 
might be picked up within minutes, certainly

22:06.636 --> 22:20.370
within a short time, within an hour usually. It was 
very rare for somebody to be pinned down for a long

22:20.510 --> 22:23.233
time. Usually they would pick up very soon in a 
hospital.

22:29.775 --> 22:34.021
About three days later, the folks would find out 
about it. His boyfriend was killed on the 3rd of

22:34.041 --> 22:39.108
September. The family found out on the 6th. His 
body got home

22:41.311 --> 22:47.500
on the 13th or 14th, 13th.

22:51.243 --> 22:54.946
And when I saw the news clips about the Beirut 
bombing, it went through my mind.

22:57.789 --> 23:02.553
They're not going to know who's killed for another 
three days or so. Maybe three or four days before

23:03.634 --> 23:05.436
anyone knows. And you know, right away, well, 
sometimes people don't know where their boys are

23:05.476 --> 23:11.421
stationed. They don't know for sure if they're in a 
sensitive area. But they often have an idea where

23:13.823 --> 23:19.408
the kids will write home and say, I think we're in. 
But, you know, people will know. that they've got

23:21.432 --> 23:26.597
somebody over there, and they'll be watching and 
wondering, you know, hoping against hope. And it

23:27.177 --> 23:38.648
was just, you know, it was a short time, and they had 
six people, I think, identified from the

23:27.177 --> 23:38.648
Metroplex or this area as being in the area. And 
then about the third day, they identified three

23:38.668 --> 23:47.216
guys who had been killed. And I think it was a replay 
of that old tape, for me. I hadn't thought about

23:53.487 --> 23:58.594
that, you know, in so long as to, you know, how long 
it took, but I just knew. You know, the first time I

23:58.854 --> 24:04.061
heard about that, I thought, you know, it's going 
to be three days. And then it was during that week

24:04.081 --> 24:10.630
that all this stuff started coming

24:04.081 --> 24:10.630
back. And another time, a couple years later, and I 
broke down. I was just, I was a real mess. A couple

24:18.500 --> 24:20.683
years later, it happened again. And at that time, 
what upset me, I read a little thing, just a little

24:20.967 --> 24:49.438
clip in a Catholic newspaper saying that Coleco 
Industries planned to market a Rambo doll

24:20.967 --> 24:49.438
complete with weapons

24:20.967 --> 24:49.438
and accessories for They didn't call it creative 
play, but something equally dumb and untrue.

24:58.334 --> 25:01.617
And it was just like, bombs went off. How can they do 
this? How can they put something like that in the

25:02.678 --> 25:07.423
hands of children? And before that, I had really, I 
think my son had one gun. I just had not bought war

25:14.191 --> 25:17.336
toys for him. Didn't identify him as war toys, just 
didn't buy these things. And then, you know, I

25:23.384 --> 25:29.834
realized, I think that's when I realized that it 
wasn't over. Things were going to, you know,

25:29.854 --> 25:33.639
continue to happen and my boy was at risk. He was 12 
at the time, you know, six years away

25:33.800 --> 25:42.112
from me. So, I suppose, you know, something could 
happen again that would trigger some, some

25:42.963 --> 25:56.700
memory, some reaction.

25:56.720 --> 26:11.738
I think, I think if the men who were there weren't 
talking about

25:56.720 --> 26:11.738
it, um, I think they would, if they'd open 
themselves up to, uh, to healing, to

25:56.720 --> 26:11.738
reconciliation. So many of the few guys I have 
talked to, they hold themselves accountable for

26:13.135 --> 26:25.148
things that they couldn't have been accountable 
for. Those guys were young. They were 18, 19, 20

26:28.051 --> 26:31.154
years old. In our culture, an 18 or 19-year-old is a 
baby. He's not able to go out and support himself

26:35.098 --> 26:39.463
and a family. You know, they're not making really 
adult decisions.

26:46.611 --> 26:56.640
They were there, you know, strictly

26:46.611 --> 26:56.640
to kill or be

26:46.611 --> 26:56.640
killed. And I had a medic tell me he had berated 
himself for years because he hadn't gone after a

26:56.840 --> 27:03.666
guy. And he was pinned down. He couldn't get out. 
And by the time they got to him, the guy was dead.

27:09.700 --> 27:16.810
There was this kid, 19 years old, who couldn't get 
to somebody because, you know, he would have been

27:09.700 --> 27:16.810
shot himself, bullets whizzing all around him. 
And for years he carried that with him.

27:23.420 --> 27:33.675
And it's so freeing when you let go of some,

27:23.420 --> 27:33.675
not just a hurt, but something you think you did 
wrong. You know, call it a sin. Or what you thought

27:36.018 --> 27:38.121
was sinful or terrible mistake. It's so freeing 
when you let

27:40.856 --> 27:45.943
go of that. And I think we'd have a different 
country. You know, you'd have more people fussing

27:47.885 --> 27:58.078
at the government

27:47.885 --> 27:58.078
for what they're doing in Central America. We're 
paying for that now. I am paying for that.

28:09.151 --> 28:16.262
But it's got to be real, and people have to, you 
know, somehow it has to be real to them. And those

28:16.282 --> 28:21.830
who were there and saw it, if they're not talking 
about it, they might not let it be real. And there's

28:21.850 --> 28:26.297
a whole lot of others who, you know, who haven't 
seen it. It can't be real unless we make it so. And,

28:30.523 --> 28:38.415
you know, it doesn't take everybody thinking the 
same way, but it takes a certain population, a

28:30.523 --> 28:38.415
certain number in the population When you get to a 
certain number, and the rest of the people

28:39.323 --> 28:52.425
will come around. You just got a lot of followers, 
you know? Anymore? No, that's it. Thank you.
