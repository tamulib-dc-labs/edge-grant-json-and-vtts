WEBVTT

00:03.912 --> 00:15.403
Now, I think where we ended rather abruptly 
yesterday was that I was asking you to make some

00:03.912 --> 00:15.403
comparison, if you could, between Scripps when 
you came here and Scripps as it is now. Well, at that

00:17.485 --> 00:19.787
time it was quite small. I think the number of 
faculty at the time was 15. And it was all tightly

00:25.372 --> 00:32.839
knit group and under very direct collaboration. 
contact in research and thinking and development

00:34.085 --> 00:42.935
with Roger Revelle, who was the director at the 
time. Whereas now, of course, it's grown

00:44.998 --> 00:47.301
tremendously. It is a huge organization. And 
there is no longer the closeness and concerted

00:51.506 --> 01:03.720
overall institute action that was possible at the 
time. Did you think there was a, it's a poor choice

01:04.055 --> 01:12.828
of words possibly, but do you think there was more 
leeway or more freedom in research then than there

01:04.055 --> 01:12.828
is now? Not due to institutional restrictions at 
all. No, complete freedom then, complete freedom

01:14.991 --> 01:18.637
now. I was not thinking so much of institutional 
restrictions as I was thinking an ability to sort

01:19.137 --> 01:26.528
of move from project to project possibly. Well, 
that is always limited by the availability of

01:26.548 --> 01:33.218
funds.

01:34.463 --> 01:40.731
Probably there is more funds going into research 
today than in those days. But science has become,

01:41.913 --> 01:46.879
first of all, much more expensive to do. 
Instrumentation and costs of doing everything

01:47.340 --> 01:50.684
has risen sky high. And furthermore, the 
individual freedom in seeking research projects

01:52.727 --> 02:01.618
of fundamental interest has been very much 
strongly curtailed these days in the country as a

02:02.510 --> 02:07.738
whole than they were then. How's that? Well, I 
think it's a long story. Essentially, the era in

02:11.705 --> 02:20.739
the 50s and the 60s was a great development of 
science in the United States after the war. The

02:22.882 --> 02:30.154
country realized from the war experience what a 
fundamental role that knowledge has in making the

02:30.539 --> 02:40.588
nation strong and the sponsoring by ONR of 
science. ONR sponsored essentially all

02:40.628 --> 02:43.090
oceanographic science in those days. So

02:43.110 --> 02:58.163
I undertake it then that you feel like that a 
decrease in funding by ONR has in effect limited

02:43.110 --> 02:58.163
one's individual research process. Well, it's 
not that simple. In those days, essentially, the

02:59.969 --> 03:03.655
nation saw fit. But through ONR, for example, 
first and later on as the National Science

03:03.815 --> 03:20.102
Foundation was founded a couple of years later, to

03:03.815 --> 03:20.102
dramatically increase the volume of scientific 
research in the country. And of course, that

03:21.344 --> 03:26.112
growth could not go on forever. What happened was, 
of course, in the very useful growth, there is also

03:27.020 --> 03:36.194
a wild flora of less useful developments. And what 
made the crisis occur, essentially, crisis in the

03:37.295 --> 03:55.002
attitude of the citizen as a whole, citizen of the 
country, toward science and scientists. was when

03:56.281 --> 04:01.329
the illusions were broken, essentially, during 
the conflict of the Vietnam War. And that is when

04:02.771 --> 04:24.685
the

04:02.771 --> 04:24.685
illusions that people had about the ethical

04:02.771 --> 04:24.685
stance and the objectivity of scientists

04:25.357 --> 04:32.608
And in addition, their responsibilities as human 
beings were seriously being questioned. People

04:32.628 --> 04:54.300
saw particularly that military support of 
scientific research was not entirely a blessing,

04:32.628 --> 04:54.300
that there were strings attached in some cases, 
even though fundamental research was often

04:32.628 --> 04:54.300
involved, and that the scientists essentially 
went where the money was, didn't necessarily

04:32.628 --> 04:54.300
follow what they were compelled to feel 
ethically. And essentially, that whole crisis

05:01.580 --> 05:24.186
then led to a strongly decreased confidence in 
that scientists can be trusted with the

05:01.580 --> 05:24.186
leadership of the country that people thought of 
them before as some kind of omniscience.

05:24.942 --> 05:51.017
perfected idealistic human beings and many of 
them didn't come out that way furthermore

05:24.942 --> 05:51.017
obviously growth must stop sometime and as a 
result essentially there were some years of

05:24.942 --> 05:51.017
terrible turmoil where everything was 
reorganized and as a result it's very difficult to

05:52.600 --> 05:56.904
Great difficulties were created in carrying out 
some of the scientific research. And in the

05:58.085 --> 06:06.212
reorganization, essentially, that has emerged 
from that, the project research is what has risen.

06:07.573 --> 06:08.394
I can understand that. The individual scientist 
is no longer trusted with the judgment of what is

06:08.534 --> 06:13.898
good or bad for the nations. Some scientists are 
very good in judging that. Others are not. And

06:18.522 --> 06:21.645
everybody has to carry the blame for the bad ones. 
And instead, then, the emphasis is on large

06:24.192 --> 06:42.714
projects where any single individual does not 
carry so much weight, but which are also then

06:24.192 --> 06:42.714
becoming often less imaginative, tremendously 
burdened down with enormous bureaucratic

06:24.192 --> 06:42.714
apparatus. And although, therefore, much, much 
more money goes into science now than maybe in

06:43.755 --> 06:50.923
dollars than in 1950s, or even 60s, the effective

06:51.848 --> 07:03.838
input, I think, is much smaller today. You mean a 
combination of bureaucratic costs plus rising

07:04.399 --> 07:07.602
inflation? Rising inflation, bureaucratic 
costs, the loss of imaginative approach that you

07:07.842 --> 07:20.893
have when everything is molded into huge 
programs, that are run from some kind of

07:21.751 --> 07:25.656
centralized bureaucracy. Some of these projects 
are very good, and they're in an imaginative way.

07:30.263 --> 07:42.960
Others become characterized by tremendous

07:30.263 --> 07:42.960
inertia and preservation mainly of business as 
usual.

07:46.164 --> 07:50.610
There is, of course, a whole spectrum of 
judgments, possibly. But I think that's on the

07:51.130 --> 07:55.297
average is a correct situation. Do you think that 
the bringing together or the making of

07:55.337 --> 08:12.664
institutions to grow in size, that's very poorly 
put, but the increase in size of research

07:55.337 --> 08:12.664
institutions has also created this concept of one 
major project or two or three major projects with a

07:55.337 --> 08:12.664
carefully designed goal? I don't think so at all. 
For example, Scripps was already quite large when

08:14.226 --> 08:18.994
this development happened. and was and has always 
been a quite anarchic institution of a number of

08:20.138 --> 08:39.080
different scientists with different ideas that 
during the time when Roger Revelle was director

08:20.138 --> 08:39.080
was all kept together by one spirit. Later they 
were carrying on on their own and mostly in quite a

08:40.702 --> 08:46.729
good fashion. It could be done. it was quite 
possible to carry out, in that situation,

08:49.788 --> 09:03.146
individual research projects of different size, 
some quite small, one-man projects, others much

08:49.788 --> 09:03.146
larger, and many of them depending on the unique 
facilities here, the ships and other things.

09:06.351 --> 09:13.280
So the institutional structure has not forced 
this retransformation, the reorganization. It

09:13.361 --> 09:18.748
is essentially the nation's way of thinking about 
what the research is, what it's good for, and what

09:19.572 --> 09:25.762
scientists are, and what they should be charged 
with, what responsibilities they should be

09:19.572 --> 09:25.762
charged with. That is what has changed. And it's 
for the good and for the bad. Do you see an expanding

09:30.851 --> 09:42.290
non-goal-oriented funds for, let's say, space 
and oceanography in the near future? Well, in

09:42.951 --> 09:44.854
space, there must be They must be goal-oriented, 
because to go out in space and work, you really need

09:45.323 --> 09:50.309
that. Their project orientation is absolute 
necessity. Everybody can't go out in his own

09:54.794 --> 09:57.036
spaceship and play around. So their profound 
organization has to characterize everything. In

10:02.483 --> 10:08.369
oceanography, the only organization

10:02.483 --> 10:08.369
you need is the institutional one. The 
institution holds available ships and all

10:08.389 --> 10:11.573
facilities. It doesn't need any national 
organization. a huge bureaucracy to do that. So in

10:17.286 --> 10:20.471
space, that must continue. In oceanography, you 
see more and more nationwide projects. Some of

10:26.799 --> 10:36.731
them are very useful because they bring together 
people in the same field, like the GeoSEX program,

10:26.799 --> 10:36.731
for example, or the NORPAC program. But in others, 
it hampers the development. There's this

10:40.396 --> 10:43.360
artificial requirement that you must, for some 
reason, bring together heterogeneous groups

10:43.829 --> 10:48.356
from all over the place. Do you see an increase or a 
decrease in international cooperation in

10:49.397 --> 10:57.349
oceanography? I think the international 
cooperation is probably gradually increasing.

11:04.159 --> 11:12.672
There are, particularly through projects such as 
IPOD, the deep-sea drilling internationalized

11:04.159 --> 11:12.672
project, and there are several other ones, I 
think, where at least some, there's some

11:13.327 --> 11:17.432
semblance to international collaboration. And 
in space, too, of course, there's some, at least

11:17.452 --> 11:30.286
theatrical attention paid to the same thing, but 
not in the, I think, in the truly scientific way,

11:17.452 --> 11:30.286
but in some kind of public relations way.

11:33.630 --> 11:38.035
Do you feel as if the developing third world 
countries and their demands for 200-mile limits

11:38.622 --> 11:47.754
and their distrust of what amounts to attitudes 
and goals of more highly developed nations? Do you

11:47.774 --> 11:49.857
feel as if that would begin to limit your research? 
Well, that's an interesting question. First of

11:53.682 --> 12:07.701
all, the third country nations have always, 
that's a field where Scripps has always played a

11:53.682 --> 12:07.701
great role in receiving scientists from these 
emerging countries. nations and to train them

12:08.440 --> 12:22.353
here, or to give them additional training to what 
they have obtained elsewhere, so that they can go

12:08.440 --> 12:22.353
back and contribute to the growing organizations 
in their home country. Mexico, the People's

12:23.394 --> 12:38.008
Republic of China, Japan, many people have come 
here and learned, and others have come here for

12:23.394 --> 12:38.008
collaboration.

12:40.486 --> 12:54.469
The new regulations you mentioned on the 200 mile 
limit, obviously that throws in another

12:40.486 --> 12:54.469
bureaucratic

12:40.486 --> 12:54.469
complication into the previously free roaming, 
possibilities of roaming around free over the

12:40.486 --> 12:54.469
ocean. But that's deplorable, I think. Any 
increased bureaucracy is just terrible. But one

13:04.465 --> 13:05.887
can also understand these countries. It is very 
clear to them that there is no that there is no

13:08.313 --> 13:15.559
clear-cut limit between scientific research and 
what this scientific research is used for.

13:16.380 --> 13:18.341
They've seen numerous examples of that. And when 
they particularly have seen the nefarious

13:18.922 --> 13:38.218
interaction or secret interaction of the US in the 
internal affairs of various countries, it's

13:18.922 --> 13:38.218
understandable that they're afraid. that 
discoveries of resources in their territorial

13:39.430 --> 13:49.785
waters, for example, will bring them into the 
limelight as an interesting place where certain

13:39.430 --> 13:49.785
things will not be allowed to happen. Or if they 
were less important in the past, they would be

13:50.426 --> 13:55.133
allowed to happen. So I can understand why this 
paranoia is growing up. And the best thing we could

14:01.021 --> 14:07.851
do as a nation, it seems to me, is to mitigate the 
situation by increasing the trust and the feeling

14:08.253 --> 14:19.429
of responsibility from the side of our nation that 
these people feel. If they trust us, there will be

14:19.690 --> 14:31.727
no difficulty, or not so much difficulty at least, 
in getting the necessary permit to operate in

14:19.690 --> 14:31.727
their waters or even to make permanent 
arrangements.

14:31.747 --> 14:34.311
Okay, now, in terms of space, then away from the 
oceans into space for a second, do you see an

14:34.493 --> 14:40.940
increase in international cooperation 
occurring there? In space? In space.

14:51.931 --> 15:02.762
Certainly at the level of international 
discussions and

14:51.931 --> 15:02.762
conferences. mutual participation, research. 
But there's not much more you could do beyond that

15:09.056 --> 15:14.302
because, again, the specialized nature of the 
expeditions. There

15:14.823 --> 15:26.677
could be USSR members of, say, cosmonaut team, but 
there's less and less space research done with

15:14.823 --> 15:26.677
cosmonauts. It's done with unmanned probes, so 
there is not much need, essentially, not much

15:32.071 --> 15:46.605
improvement that would be obtained by making 
hybrid instrumentation

15:32.071 --> 15:46.605
packages. In some cases, it could be. And there is 
such a collaboration, for example, between the

15:48.246 --> 16:01.639
German space agency and the USA Space Agency in the 
exploration of comets, for example, where the

15:48.246 --> 16:01.639
Germans have advanced power and the U.S. is less 
far advanced and the possibility then for U.S.

16:02.075 --> 16:17.435
investigators to place instrumentation on 
Russian spacecraft and vice versa and German

16:02.075 --> 16:17.435
spacecraft and vice versa has been quite 
fruitful. I don't know if it will increase much in

16:17.816 --> 16:23.223
that respect with regard to USSR. I think there is 
still quite a lot of mistrust between the nations

16:25.185 --> 16:31.153
and and also the interlocking, the close 
relationship between military intelligence or

16:31.994 --> 16:59.807
military applications of space science

16:31.994 --> 16:59.807
and the information you derive from space 
experiments, from some space experiments, will

16:31.994 --> 16:59.807
add a touch of touchiness to those questions also 
in the future.

17:01.222 --> 17:15.736
Has there been, in your opinion, much uneasiness 
concerning the close relationship of the

17:01.222 --> 17:15.736
military and oceanography and the military and 
space among scientists? Well, in space, first of

17:15.756 --> 17:28.528
all, that development took place so late that the 
country has drawn a lesson and kept rather

17:30.213 --> 17:37.320
rather watertight separation between the 
civilian applications of space science and the

17:30.213 --> 17:37.320
military applications and the intelligence 
applications. So with regard to execution of the

17:38.340 --> 17:43.325
programs, there is no interaction at all.

17:46.228 --> 17:59.680
The

17:46.228 --> 17:59.680
justification of the civilian space program had 
some overtones of the attending military

18:00.301 --> 18:01.022
advantages. So I can say it was a pity that it wasn't 
possible to man a scientific research program

18:01.042 --> 18:16.625
without having that aspect contributing. But 
that's not so bad, it seems to me. If something like

18:19.549 --> 18:24.156
that could be helpful. In the case of 
oceanography, Again, in

18:29.630 --> 18:52.361
the case of the interaction of the Navy, for 
example, with oceanographic program, I think

18:29.630 --> 18:52.361
that's always been a very, very constructive 
interaction. And the tradition in the Navy, not

18:53.122 --> 18:59.451
only in this country, but in other countries, has 
always been one of the most research-minded

19:00.005 --> 19:02.287
organizations and research for its own sake. So I

19:04.630 --> 19:18.544
think,

19:04.630 --> 19:18.544
on average, I don't think there have been very bad, 
particularly bad repercussions there. Of

19:19.905 --> 19:25.451
course, when one thinks about the thing in more 
subtle details, it has effects. One can always

19:27.213 --> 19:29.235
ask, how is one's independent judgment of 
political, military issues, colored by the fact

19:29.992 --> 19:39.364
that you receive, for example, all your support 
from a military organization. I think

19:39.545 --> 19:53.143
subconsciously it

19:39.545 --> 19:53.143
is affecting many people directly, so that their 
unbiased thinking is not so unbiased. That is, of

19:53.163 --> 19:58.230
course, a negative aspect. But it It must be said 
that the Navy bears, the Office of Naval Research

19:59.523 --> 20:20.630
bears or takes the credit for beginning and 
carrying the early scientific armament,

19:59.523 --> 20:20.630
rearmament in the civilian sense, in the 
fundamental scientific sense of US

19:59.523 --> 20:20.630
oceanography. And in the present situation, the 
UNR has decreased its role substantially. It is

20:25.397 --> 20:28.821
now, as you know, all the armed forces Agencies 
have been forced by legislation

20:30.083 --> 20:38.537
to support only mission-oriented. They've been 
able to prove that the research that you do with

20:38.977 --> 20:51.077
support from the armed forces is clearly 
mission-oriented. And that's fine. They need for

20:51.738 --> 20:57.627
security and defense and attack. Because it's 
also called defense. Specific information. And

21:03.778 --> 21:12.351
it seems to me that's one of the purposes of the 
institutions of the country to provide what the

21:03.778 --> 21:12.351
government legitimately needs. But it's 
important to keep that, I think, separate from

21:13.513 --> 21:20.063
scientific activities. And again, it's groups 
that has been done insofar as all these

21:20.244 --> 21:26.854
mission-oriented activities are kept in a 
separate organization and separate from the

21:27.880 --> 21:30.343
campus. This was not done on an absolutely 
voluntary basis, although the separation has

21:31.585 --> 21:37.333
always been partially done. It was largely 
catalyzed by the student protest during the 60s.

21:43.642 --> 21:45.905
At the University of California San Diego? Right. 
And I think that's when classified research

21:48.028 --> 21:53.115
stopped being done, is that correct? When it 
stopped being done on campus. It's still being

21:55.876 --> 21:59.681
done to a quite large extent off campus.

22:03.647 --> 22:20.791
In these veins of political geography and 
political oceanography,

22:03.647 --> 22:20.791
do you feel uneasy ever about the fact that 
scientists serve as consultants for private

22:03.647 --> 22:20.791
enterprise and for military as well for the 
academic campus? No, I think on the contrary. A

22:23.011 --> 22:30.722
consultation done by scientists is really one of 
the ways to keep in touch with the real world. And

22:31.803 --> 22:39.774
scientists otherwise tend very easily to become 
too theoretical or irresponsible. If you are

22:40.716 --> 22:49.027
allowed to build airplanes that never have to fly, 
then it's possible that the design is not so

22:40.716 --> 22:49.027
crucially thought about. If the airplane has to 
fly, then other pressures on you to really solve

22:52.812 --> 22:58.538
problems in a realistic fashion. Correct me if I'm 
summing this up incorrectly. It's an awful

23:01.761 --> 23:02.782
phrase. Again, you see Scripps Institution of 
Oceanography, then. You see their job as a

23:06.646 --> 23:12.732
combination of work in military, private 
enterprise, and private sciences. If you should

23:12.792 --> 23:18.858
like a public institution serving all three 
sectors of society. No, I think that... Scripps as

23:21.230 --> 23:34.989
it is should, although it entirely does it, should 
serve only

23:21.230 --> 23:34.989
civilian and scientific purposes. Then if the 
staff places their capabilities at the disposal

23:36.311 --> 23:49.870
of

23:36.311 --> 23:49.870
industry or to the government as consultants, 
They do that normally, but you have to, by rule,

23:50.390 --> 24:02.226
take leave of absence or vacation while you do 
that, or do it when you're not serving the

23:50.390 --> 24:02.226
university. So that's very important, of course, 
that you deprive the taxpayers of the service that

24:02.647 --> 24:11.639
you have to give them. And particularly since most 
people use the proceeds of consultation for their

24:13.261 --> 24:20.110
own personal income, and more rarely for the 
benefit of the university. Now, when you came

24:26.974 --> 24:31.019
here, Roger Revelle was the director. Is that 
correct? Yes. And he remained director until he

24:32.621 --> 24:37.186
actually went off to Harvard. He sort of wore two 
hats here for a while. That's true. OK. Have you

24:40.931 --> 24:48.780
noticed any abrupt change between the direction 
of the institution under Revelle and then after

24:40.931 --> 24:48.780
his successors? No, no, everybody's tried to do 
the best they can, they could, in their own way, and

24:50.060 --> 25:01.650
each one of the directors have contributed very 
great things. For example, again, Roger Wells'

25:02.911 --> 25:19.746
greatness were particularly in the tremendous 
inspiration that he gave to everybody and his

25:02.911 --> 25:19.746
ability to

25:02.911 --> 25:19.746
amalgamate and weld everybody together into a 
joint effort in fields of importance. In

25:25.922 --> 25:41.802
these efforts, perhaps, he did not have time or so 
much understanding for the importance of

25:25.922 --> 25:41.802
sophisticated scientific facilities. He had 
largely a Puritan instinct that science should be

25:42.884 --> 25:50.053
done in an inexpensive fashion, which is very 
commendable. But for many things in modern

25:50.843 --> 25:53.465
science, that's not so easy. Cyclotrons are hard 
to make out of old pipes and things like that.

26:01.933 --> 26:10.802
Professor Nirenberg, Director Nirenberg, for 
example, has done a tremendous job in two fields

26:01.933 --> 26:10.802
particularly that I can see, probably more. But 
the two that particularly stand out in my mind are

26:10.862 --> 26:19.770
his bringing scripts into the computer era, into 
the proper handling of data. Previously, in the

26:20.527 --> 26:30.782
enthusiasm of doing things, lots of data were 
collected on shipboard, and then forgotten, and

26:20.527 --> 26:30.782
could not, the way they were handled and stored, 
you could never retrieve them. Now, thanks to

26:31.363 --> 26:36.290
Director Nirenberg, essentially, computers 
were installed on board. All information that

26:36.730 --> 26:50.230
was, which is so voluminous that it's bound to be 
lost unless you do something special,

26:36.730 --> 26:50.230
was immediately retrievable, and that has been 
immensely advantageous. Also the introduction

26:51.256 --> 27:01.205
of online computers in campus laboratories and on 
shipboard has been much stimulated by him. And

27:01.786 --> 27:19.963
also the creation in the institution of a very 
well-organized analytical facility that has a

27:01.786 --> 27:19.963
wide range of sophisticated instrumentation 
that is difficult for each individual and his

27:01.786 --> 27:19.963
contract or anything to justify, but which serves 
the whole community at the recharge including

27:20.720 --> 27:25.665
students, has been one of the really great 
developments that he's done. So each one has

27:25.685 --> 27:29.549
contributed in its own way, I think. All right. Of 
what sort of computers is he installed now?

27:34.134 --> 27:47.409
Medium-sized computers of various kinds that are 
on board of the ships so that you can put in, first of

27:34.134 --> 27:47.409
all, all the navigation, and you can relate the 
navigation and the positions to the scientific

27:34.134 --> 27:47.409
data. That was something that in old times took 
many months to go through the ship's logs and find

27:50.065 --> 27:56.373
out where were you when you found such and such a 
thing, exactly. Now it's all there right away.

27:58.736 --> 28:04.803
Where did other institutions already utilize 
computers on shipboard? That was essentially the

28:06.044 --> 28:09.268
theme of the era. And that happened 
simultaneously, I think, at other institutions.

28:12.913 --> 28:17.598
But I'm not sure that it's been so thoroughly 
carried out as here. But I wouldn't swear on that.

28:20.339 --> 28:21.260
Look at their facilities. Had other nations 
utilized computers on shipboard before the

28:21.320 --> 28:26.146
United States? Again, it came at the same time. And 
particularly in France and Germany have always

28:27.909 --> 28:35.999
been rather advanced in the field. The USSR has 
been lagging behind, but I think it is coming up

28:37.280 --> 28:42.387
again. But the US has certainly, the United States 
have been leading in this because of their leading

28:42.427 --> 28:48.895
role both in software and hardware development. 
It has been suggested in another interview that

28:50.883 --> 29:00.475
possibly the age of the great explorations of 
oceans is over. Because with the introduction of

29:02.438 --> 29:13.092
computers, shipboard, and so forth, that more and 
more analyzing of data will have to be done back in

29:02.438 --> 29:13.092
labs and this sort of thing. That the old idea of the 
oceanographer at sea maybe through. I don't think

29:17.045 --> 29:17.927
so at all. No, I don't think so at all. And 
particularly with sophisticated ships, with

29:18.930 --> 29:27.309
large ships that are essentially floating 
laboratories, you can do more and more

29:18.930 --> 29:27.309
experimental work on board. That is
