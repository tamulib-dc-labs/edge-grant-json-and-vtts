00:01.634 --> 00:29.481
I think

00:01.634 --> 00:29.481
that one thing that I probably regret

00:01.634 --> 00:29.481
would be not really appreciating

00:01.634 --> 00:29.481
the a black perspective in the early

00:31.368 --> 00:40.227
1960s. And not appreciating it simply because I 
was taught the Hmong culture and I was I wasn't

00:49.188 --> 00:52.673
believing that. I didn't have the passion for it. I 
really didn't appreciate it. So I guess what I'm

00:54.936 --> 01:03.647
saying is that I regret that I didn't have the 
appreciation

00:54.936 --> 01:03.647
that I have now. And really, the genuine 
sensitivity, which I thank God for,

01:03.667 --> 01:14.942
really torn

01:03.667 --> 01:14.942
another really minority And we're all minority 
people one way or another, somewhere along the

01:16.255 --> 01:22.965
line. And just really caring for people. And I 
think when God comes into your life, he gives you

01:27.633 --> 01:29.315
the kind of love. You can care for your brother, 
whether he's a darker brother or a lighter

01:30.137 --> 01:35.705
brother. You can care for him. As far as doing 
something different, I've got to say... That when

01:44.369 --> 01:49.335
you're dealing with people, let me give you an 
example of what I'm talking about. When I went with

01:49.355 --> 01:56.122
my first church in Alabama, it was in Dauphin, 
Alabama. It was in 1974.

01:59.707 --> 02:09.017
One of the previous ministers in that church was 
there from, say, 1966 to 1968, something like

01:59.707 --> 02:09.017
that. And... He was a graduate of Union 
Theological Seminary. It's a liberal seminary in

02:14.286 --> 02:18.571
the Southern Presbyterian Church. And he, this 
was right in the height of the Civil Rights

02:18.591 --> 02:26.200
Movement. He had the March of Washington. This guy 
stood up in the pulpit for these people from

02:27.542 --> 02:31.707
Southern Alabama. So many of them are from the 
rural background. And he declares

02:37.427 --> 02:48.242
in the book that he really shouldn't be in the book.

02:48.262 --> 02:50.785
He really ought to be out there marching in the 
streets with the civil rights movement. And that

02:50.805 --> 02:51.406
is really the gospel. And that guy represented the 
liberal Christianity.

02:56.593 --> 03:01.961
The gospel is changing social

02:56.593 --> 03:01.961
institutions. His approach was revolutionary. 
He grew that church from 130 to 66. What did he

03:11.235 --> 03:14.859
accomplish?

03:14.879 --> 03:18.424
I came in in 1970. I was there until 1977. And we saw 
the church grow. We also saw the church grow in a

03:31.508 --> 03:38.218
spiritually in terms of race relationships.

03:38.238 --> 03:42.685
But it was an evolution. We're trying to help 
people understand what God is saying in His Word to

03:42.705 --> 03:50.297
people. And what does that say about how you live 
your life? So in the sense of taking an

03:55.572 --> 04:06.824
evolutionary approach instead of a 
revolutionary

03:55.572 --> 04:06.824
approach, I think that was a good thing. I do not 
regret

04:06.844 --> 04:11.068
that at all. Let me mention that.

04:14.912 --> 04:20.578
No, I think that's about

04:14.912 --> 04:20.578
as specific as I can be. How much? How much of an 
impact did the Civil Rights Movement have? Well,

04:29.583 --> 04:35.109
let me mention, I think this is interesting. This 
concerns a church that I know that was in the PCA,

04:35.169 --> 04:50.605
and this was probably in maybe the early 80s, and 
this particular church had adopted in the coming

04:52.508 --> 04:56.493
out of the Civil Rights Movement. They've adopted 
post-war monarchy. This was a church that was in

04:57.214 --> 05:00.818
the South. And this church, even in the mid-1970s,

05:01.038 --> 05:19.300
this particular congregation in the South,

05:01.038 --> 05:19.300
had some officers that stood out in front of the 
church and turned, and turned backs. And some

05:19.320 --> 05:20.642
people were coming in, because there was all that 
people. And the, and this policy continued. Now

05:32.479 --> 05:35.805
that, my understanding is that those people took 
some heat. Some of those people, some of those

05:35.825 --> 05:45.101
leaders took some heat from their children, who 
were adults.

05:45.121 --> 05:45.582
Wasn't the worst thing. And, I think in the early 
1980s, this church went through a review of that

05:47.032 --> 05:53.523
policy. And the thing that's really interesting 
about it, just to show you how God can work, the

05:53.543 --> 06:07.986
people that did the review of that were the very 
people, some of whom had been involved in

05:53.543 --> 06:07.986
establishing that policy in the very beginning. 
And they were some of the very people who had been

06:08.006 --> 06:12.634
around in the mid-1970s. and re-debated

06:13.289 --> 06:32.599
that issue and

06:13.289 --> 06:32.599
turned

06:13.289 --> 06:32.599
away those people of courage. They continued to 
hold on to the policy of keeping the border. They

06:33.881 --> 06:34.422
re-studied that issue. They went through kind of a 
bondless question and they voted to do away with

06:34.442 --> 06:36.225
that policy. So in

06:38.551 --> 06:56.121
many cases, it's not what you do, but the way you go 
about doing it. And God just kind of had prepared.

06:58.565 --> 06:59.627
He kind of worked to prepare. But you see, you've 
got certain... certain folks who can't be

07:03.728 --> 07:07.612
patient. It's got to be now. And they want a war, and 
there's got to be a revolution. That took, let's

07:17.502 --> 07:24.529
say, that took from 1965 to the early 1990s for that 
change to happen. And even then when that changed,

07:24.549 --> 07:30.255
not everybody agreed. But you've got to 
understand, the median age So

07:32.585 --> 08:02.322
I think

07:32.585 --> 08:02.322
that to me is an illustration of the best way to 
approach

07:32.585 --> 08:02.322
this. Is there anything else that you would like to 
say?

08:19.090 --> 08:34.806
Well, I can remember that

08:19.090 --> 08:34.806
on one occasion somebody shared with me a paper 
that had been written by a conservative pastor

08:35.647 --> 08:44.319
probably back in the 1960s, in which he was trying 
to present a biblical basis

08:35.647 --> 08:44.319
for segregation. And as I sat down and read through 
the paper, I was aghast at the incredible

08:44.339 --> 09:01.722
misinterpretation and misuse of the scripture in 
order to justify a cultural position. And I can

09:03.288 --> 09:05.210
understand that. I think there's a danger that 
whenever we come to the Scriptures that there's a

09:05.230 --> 09:21.507
danger, always the danger, that we will want to 
bend the Scripture to our cultural bias instead of

09:05.230 --> 09:21.507
us being directed and corrected by the Scripture. 
So I guess that would just be one thing I would say is

09:21.527 --> 09:31.017
that I believe the Scripture is the ultimate thorn 
in our life. And that

09:31.688 --> 09:56.675
we need

09:31.688 --> 09:56.675
to constantly and prayerfully work at, in the 
process of interpretation,

09:31.688 --> 09:56.675
that we're not trying to make the Scripture fit in 
with our own bias. That we really are being

09:56.695 --> 09:59.198
challenged and corrected and directed by the 
Scripture in our attitudes and our approach to

09:56.695 --> 09:59.198
culture. There is nothing else, and that finishes 
it. Well, Mark, I really appreciate this

10:04.673 --> 10:27.863
opportunity, and I hope that as this gets added to 
the growing body of oral tapes and oral history

10:04.673 --> 10:27.863
department at Texas A&M, I hope this will be of help 
in terms of scholarship and research for people in

10:04.673 --> 10:27.863
years to come. We surely appreciate it. You're 
very welcome.
