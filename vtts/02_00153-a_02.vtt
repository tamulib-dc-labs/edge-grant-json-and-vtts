WEBVTT

00:03.153 --> 00:13.726
I got into freshman chemistry, and I guess I was never so thankful for C in my life as that.

00:14.888 --> 00:15.709
What about the math?

00:15.769 --> 00:20.074
You said you didn't have- Didn't have any calculus, but we didn't have that much math required.

00:20.094 --> 00:23.338
It wasn't until graduate school that I had to have calculus, so.

00:23.418 --> 00:24.300
Oh, okay.

00:24.320 --> 00:30.207
So that did a problem, and I did well in Algebra II and Algebra here.

00:32.026 --> 00:39.036
Physics was hard, but it was a sophomore course, and I'd never had any physics.

00:40.819 --> 00:43.042
Did you and your buddies go to class every day?

00:43.643 --> 00:44.845
Oh, yes.

00:44.905 --> 00:46.046
Saturdays, too.

00:46.066 --> 00:46.707
Saturday morning.

00:47.288 --> 00:48.390
But, I mean, you attended.

00:49.111 --> 00:49.632
Oh, yes.

00:50.473 --> 00:51.835
There wasn't any place else to go.

00:52.416 --> 00:54.298
I mean, you weren't going to stay around the dorm.

00:56.281 --> 01:00.868
Was there a place that you could, during the day, if you didn't have anything scheduled,

01:01.388 --> 01:06.149
didn't have a class that, was there any place you could kind of escape from all the routine?

01:06.792 --> 01:08.901
Out of the library and the why.

01:10.906 --> 01:13.350
And where in the library would you go?

01:13.370 --> 01:15.373
In the big reading room.

01:15.453 --> 01:16.494
In the big reading room?

01:16.855 --> 01:18.157
Okay.

01:18.177 --> 01:18.357
Yeah.

01:19.018 --> 01:21.702
Because I don't think we had access to the stacks in those days.

01:21.822 --> 01:23.445
I think it was strictly in the reading room.

01:24.406 --> 01:27.951
And let's make believe that you were truly tired, worn out.

01:28.072 --> 01:32.458
Where could you go to take a nap?

01:34.987 --> 01:38.031
That, I don't remember, but I presume there.

01:38.051 --> 01:38.952
You see people.

01:38.972 --> 01:42.277
Yeah, dove in there.

01:43.779 --> 01:48.265
The juniors and seniors came back.

01:49.166 --> 01:57.617
Then all they did when they got here after that first week was they just added to the burden of you fish.

01:57.677 --> 01:58.398
Is that right?

01:58.418 --> 01:58.638
Yes.

01:59.780 --> 02:02.243
What are some of the, there must have been some,

02:02.223 --> 02:08.089
some pranks that you remember during the meal time?

02:08.329 --> 02:11.633
What are some pranks you recall in your outfit?

02:12.293 --> 02:23.365
I don't remember when this happened, but the practice of drowning out a whole dorm started.

02:25.847 --> 02:31.453
And those dorms had two fire hoses

02:31.923 --> 02:36.867
at each end of the building, so there were eight fire hoses.

02:37.028 --> 02:53.442
One night at supper, somebody turned on all eight of those, and I think it was darn eight, and you can imagine the commotion that that caused.

02:53.462 --> 02:55.924
In fact, there were stories that had cracked the foundation.

02:55.984 --> 03:01.069
I don't know if that was true or not, but that was an example.

03:02.720 --> 03:19.524
Oh, we had old study lamps with a bowl and a shade, and oh, some people would take some cheese and put on the light bulb in the upperclassmen's room, and.

03:19.544 --> 03:21.347
For fragrance?

03:21.367 --> 03:23.129
Yes, and one time we.

03:23.510 --> 03:26.234
Was it Limburger cheese?

03:26.254 --> 03:32.102
Yeah, and you could do the same thing on a muffler too, on a manifold on a car.

03:33.162 --> 03:43.723
This didn't happen in our outfit, but in one outfit, they caught a cat and fed it ex-lax and put it in our classmate's room.

03:43.743 --> 03:47.110
So there were lots of things that went on.

03:48.192 --> 03:55.086
The, that first, that first fall, was there anything academic

03:56.315 --> 04:11.696
that the faculty encouraged or discouraged that you now realize was important to you and your... I don't think of anything.

04:12.958 --> 04:23.993
As I say, being encouraged to take an advanced course in English literature was by Professor Allen was

04:25.593 --> 04:43.193
was one example, but we were just so, so having to concentrate so hard on our studies that we wouldn't have really thought about anything like that.

04:44.675 --> 04:49.440
Did you have the impression the faculty cared about you, you and the other students?

04:54.955 --> 04:56.016
Not in my freshman year.

04:57.158 --> 05:00.722
I didn't get a feel.

05:01.162 --> 05:03.946
As I advanced, I felt that.

05:04.687 --> 05:08.651
Was there anybody you turned to that first semester or so for advice?

05:12.356 --> 05:20.946
Well, I had a little advantage.

05:22.782 --> 05:32.073
My aunt, my mother's older sister, had a girl that she took, I'd say took in.

05:32.373 --> 05:43.727
She was teaching English in school at that time and this, had this girl and she didn't have any children and so she came and lived with her and so she became

05:43.707 --> 05:45.189
kind of like an adopted daughter.

05:46.431 --> 05:54.283
And she became an English teacher, and then she was one of the women who came here in the fall of 46 as English teachers.

05:55.244 --> 05:56.406
Claire Huggett was one.

05:56.646 --> 05:59.571
This was Margaret, Margaret Lemon at that time.

05:59.591 --> 06:01.033
Lemon?

06:01.073 --> 06:03.536
Frank Pierce was one of them in the group.

06:04.117 --> 06:11.368
Anyway, I could go see her and, you know, I always felt that I had an opening there.

06:12.344 --> 06:17.251
And then I was active in the YMCA.

06:18.012 --> 06:19.555
Describe how you got involved in that.

06:20.616 --> 06:22.319
Just got involved right away.

06:22.919 --> 06:25.383
Mr. Cashin took me under his wing and Gordon Gay.

06:26.264 --> 06:34.977
Describe those two men and their manner and their style.

06:41.285 --> 06:42.566
Kind of hard to describe.

06:45.269 --> 06:48.673
Mr. Cashin was kind of a gruff.

06:48.693 --> 07:01.667
He'd been a coach, you know, and he was kind of gruff, but he took a liking to me, and I felt like I was one of his boys.

07:02.769 --> 07:05.572
Gordon Gay I knew at church, too.

07:06.813 --> 07:08.575
By the way, that was something that

07:10.647 --> 07:14.892
That really helped me in the church and the aspect of being able to go to church.

07:15.954 --> 07:20.840
They encouraged that Sunday night and Wednesday night and Sunday morning.

07:20.860 --> 07:22.062
You say they, who is they?

07:22.843 --> 07:23.303
The core.

07:24.144 --> 07:26.788
No, we were free to go to church services.

07:26.808 --> 07:32.796
That was... And was one of the blessings of that also that you could escape from... Exactly, exactly.

07:33.697 --> 07:39.304
But at church, we had Gordon Gay, Fred Bryson,

07:39.858 --> 07:53.272
Spike White were all teachers in the Sunday School class, and of course we had such a small church that we knew everybody, A&M Methodism, and we had that old tabernacle while we met.

07:53.292 --> 08:01.861
So between the Y and church, you know, I had an opportunity for solace and comfort.

08:02.222 --> 08:04.925
You said the old tabernacle, where was it?

08:07.027 --> 08:08.228
It was,

08:08.326 --> 08:12.412
Well, it's, you know, where our current sanctuary is.

08:13.594 --> 08:19.983
It's, it was parallel to University Drive at the end of that.

08:20.103 --> 08:26.993
In other words, between that first masonry building that was built was the Gay Building.

08:26.973 --> 08:29.316
Excuse me.

08:29.336 --> 08:31.979
And it was built just behind the old tabernacle.

08:32.019 --> 08:38.247
The tabernacle's left there and the tabernacle was torn down when the sanctuary was built so it was right between there.

08:38.428 --> 08:39.509
So there was a frame building?

08:41.692 --> 08:41.892
Mm-hmm.

08:41.912 --> 08:42.132
Okay.

08:42.152 --> 08:45.517
Have any guess as to what the congregational number was then?

08:46.438 --> 08:47.759
Probably 150, 200.

08:50.963 --> 08:53.807
But as I say with

08:54.091 --> 09:00.180
with people like Fred Bryson and Gordon Gay and Spike White.

09:02.143 --> 09:05.548
Got lots of at least moral support.

09:07.711 --> 09:10.175
What was Mr. White's duty then on campus?

09:11.517 --> 09:15.222
He was basically in charge of student activities.

09:15.202 --> 09:22.190
He was under Penny, Penworthy, but he was basically in charge of, as I say, student activities.

09:23.432 --> 09:27.236
And so Wednesday night, Sunday night.

09:27.677 --> 09:28.258
Sunday morning.

09:28.418 --> 09:29.859
And then Sunday morning Sunday school.

09:31.301 --> 09:33.083
Did you Methodists have a nickname?

09:33.324 --> 09:36.908
Everything else had a nickname around here, didn't it?

09:36.928 --> 09:37.509
I don't remember.

09:39.531 --> 09:41.293
What other churches were at the Northgate area?

09:42.640 --> 09:49.031
Well, the Presbyterian and the Catholic and the Lutheran.

09:50.634 --> 09:51.255
The Baptist.

09:51.275 --> 09:53.058
Baptist, of course, First Baptist, yeah.

09:56.304 --> 10:00.932
And then at, on the south side of the campus was the Episcopal already there?

10:00.952 --> 10:04.598
The Episcopal Church was there, yeah.

10:07.008 --> 10:18.962
As you're getting in this first fall semester, getting involved in everything, describe getting ready for a football game for a freshman.

10:24.629 --> 10:34.500
Well, of course, first thing I had to do was make the banners, the spirit signs, and that was always a big job.

10:35.442 --> 10:39.348
Where did the raw materials for those come from?

10:42.453 --> 10:43.094
I don't remember.

10:44.517 --> 10:45.558
Did you all have to buy them?

10:46.460 --> 10:47.201
Oh, yes, sure.

10:49.044 --> 10:55.234
Well, there were two, used to be two hardware stores at Northgate, I presume.

10:55.415 --> 10:57.418
I remember, I'm sure we bought paint up there.

10:58.219 --> 10:59.742
And where the canvas came from, I don't know.

10:59.802 --> 11:00.623
But who paid for it?

11:01.109 --> 11:02.872
Oh, we paid for it out of the outfit funds.

11:02.892 --> 11:04.234
Oh, out of the outfit funds.

11:04.254 --> 11:04.575
Yeah.

11:04.715 --> 11:04.855
Okay.

11:04.955 --> 11:06.998
No, each outfit had a new time.

11:07.059 --> 11:09.062
And were the freshmen to do all this?

11:09.222 --> 11:09.643
Oh, yes.

11:10.284 --> 11:13.689
Who designed them?

11:14.070 --> 11:16.313
Basically we did, as I recall.

11:16.333 --> 11:23.185
I don't know what the involvement of the upperclassmen was, but I'm sure they had to prove.

11:24.406 --> 11:26.610
And these were done for every home game?

11:27.333 --> 11:27.955
For every game.

11:28.316 --> 11:29.058
For every game.

11:30.261 --> 11:32.588
And where did you display them?

11:32.608 --> 11:33.691
Off the side of the dorm.

11:35.094 --> 11:38.203
And then after that game is over, they're thrown away?

11:39.112 --> 11:45.040
Did anybody ever try one that was goofy or perhaps in bad taste?

11:45.220 --> 11:47.223
Oh yeah.

11:47.243 --> 11:52.410
You tried to do everything you could.

11:52.431 --> 12:01.423
I remember one before Baylor gave.

12:01.403 --> 12:06.149
Mr. and Mrs. Bates and their son Master.

12:06.169 --> 12:10.275
Oh my goodness, oh my goodness.

12:10.295 --> 12:14.720
I mean we, we did all kinds of things.

12:14.740 --> 12:19.486
Did anybody, did one outfit ever do anything to somebody else, another outfits?

12:20.027 --> 12:21.289
Well not like they did later.

12:22.070 --> 12:27.597
I don't remember anything happening but

12:27.982 --> 12:38.515
Later it used to, it became a habit to try to destroy the,

12:39.001 --> 12:42.667
some of them, in fact, even throwing a mullethod cocktail on them and burn them.

12:43.509 --> 12:44.731
But we didn't have any of that.

12:45.532 --> 12:49.459
Of course, then we had bonfire time at Thanksgiving, well, before Thanksgiving.

12:49.479 --> 12:51.643
That started about the first of October.

12:52.103 --> 12:55.209
But let's back up and go to those first football games.

12:55.269 --> 12:57.973
Yelp practices in your freshman year were held where?

12:59.155 --> 13:00.638
No, on the steps of Goodwin Hall.

13:01.580 --> 13:04.303
Goodwin, and at what time?

13:04.483 --> 13:05.664
They weren't at midnight, were they?

13:06.164 --> 13:09.428
Well, before home game, we had the midnight.

13:09.688 --> 13:10.188
Oh, is that right?

13:10.208 --> 13:10.949
Yeah, practice.

13:11.830 --> 13:12.771
Before every home game.

13:13.612 --> 13:21.499
But they were, as I recall, on Tuesday and Thursday nights at 7.30, I want to say, on the steps of Goodwin home.

13:22.000 --> 13:23.581
Do you remember going to your first game?

13:24.362 --> 13:24.802
Oh, yes.

13:25.023 --> 13:25.503
Describe.

13:26.424 --> 13:30.608
Well, I remember standing there in the sun all afternoon yelling,

13:31.988 --> 13:35.833
Self-horse.

13:35.853 --> 13:38.477
And then after the game, what did you and your buddies do for fun?

13:42.001 --> 13:42.602
I don't remember.

13:42.642 --> 13:45.927
Didn't go back to the Norman study.

13:50.994 --> 13:58.063
We may have, we may have had it off because I remember going to

13:59.309 --> 14:01.612
downtown Bryan taking the bus.

14:01.632 --> 14:04.015
That was the only picture show, you know, the Palace Theater.

14:04.455 --> 14:08.380
Well, we had the Queen and the Dixie at that time too.

14:09.441 --> 14:19.694
Cost 15 cents go to, on the bus downtown, and movie cost 25 cents, hamburger cost 25 cents.

14:20.835 --> 14:23.899
Do you remember what your budget was for spending money?

14:25.516 --> 14:31.807
No, but I have a little account book somewhere here, a little pocket book where I had some stuff like that, the reason I know it.

14:34.412 --> 14:44.430
My tuition, as I recall, my tuition and fees, room and board, were something over $900 for the year.

14:45.993 --> 14:48.958
And did you earn some of that or?

14:49.327 --> 14:50.449
Who paid that?

14:51.771 --> 15:01.526
Well the first money I ever earned and that went toward education.

15:01.906 --> 15:10.980
Dad told me if I'd learned to milk a cow he'd give me a calf so every year he'd give me a calf that was mine and I'd

15:11.298 --> 15:12.762
Would be about a hundred dollars.

15:12.983 --> 15:14.548
Would you then sell that calf?

15:14.969 --> 15:15.210
Mm-hmm.

15:15.230 --> 15:17.136
Okay.

15:17.156 --> 15:25.982
And in high school I was in FFA and we showed calves and I made money that way.

15:26.992 --> 15:33.662
So I had a... So did you have a... I had some money when I... Did you have a... You had a little account then when you came.

15:34.483 --> 15:38.689
Now, was that money for your spending money or was that to pay room and board?

15:38.710 --> 15:39.170
Both.

15:39.190 --> 15:39.371
Both.

15:39.391 --> 15:39.591
Okay.

15:40.873 --> 15:45.800
And was there any definition from your parents as to how much you could spend?

15:46.061 --> 15:46.241
No.

15:46.882 --> 15:47.002
No.

15:47.322 --> 15:52.690
They were... There wasn't anything to spend it on.

15:52.710 --> 15:54.433
And as you know, there were no banks then.

15:55.240 --> 16:08.198
and so we would deposit our money at the controller's office and what's now the system building and then go down and draw on that as we needed it during the year.

16:11.122 --> 16:22.277
On a Saturday night then what were the wild things that some of the people were doing your first year or two other than going to the movie?

16:23.742 --> 16:28.570
Well, some of them would go on beer busts, stuff like that.

16:29.051 --> 16:31.575
Old different places off campus.

16:33.698 --> 16:39.307
It used to be the Clay Pits, did you ever hear the Clay Pits?

16:39.327 --> 16:50.205
People go down there and that was another place after they cracked down on the board where people would go to beat the freshman's tail.

16:50.472 --> 16:55.379
Now, the clay pits were down Welborn Road to the west.

16:56.360 --> 16:57.021
Yeah, toward the river.

16:57.442 --> 17:02.449
About how far down Welborn and how far west?

17:02.469 --> 17:03.230
I've forgotten where.

17:03.290 --> 17:05.033
I think it was between Welborn and Millican.

17:05.053 --> 17:05.153
Okay.

17:06.074 --> 17:08.838
And then maybe a couple of miles west.

17:10.200 --> 17:10.941
Too far to walk.

17:11.702 --> 17:13.044
Oh, yeah.

17:13.064 --> 17:14.646
So, rode in somebody's car.

17:15.247 --> 17:19.433
And these, these were old excavation,

17:20.611 --> 17:34.948
Yeah, it was a, I think it's product, I forget what it was, but it was, I want to say something like talcum powder or something like that.

17:36.069 --> 17:37.631
And it was private property.

17:38.732 --> 17:42.436
Yeah, but there didn't seem to be any control on access.

17:42.456 --> 17:44.319
And there was beer.

17:44.339 --> 17:47.783
I think there were some signs, but nobody ever enforced it.

17:47.883 --> 17:49.825
There was beer and skinny dipping.

17:50.513 --> 17:53.096
A good swimming area.

17:53.457 --> 17:54.999
What else went on down there?

17:57.282 --> 17:58.804
You know I'm so naive I didn't know.

18:00.606 --> 18:02.368
I never went down there but once or twice.

18:02.609 --> 18:13.062
Went down swimming one time later and I think as I recall when we got handles beaten off they took us down there.

18:14.982 --> 18:21.390
Did you and your buddies ever hear about any chicken ranch at LaGrange when you were younger?

18:21.410 --> 18:21.630
Oh, yeah.

18:21.650 --> 18:23.313
Is that right?

18:23.393 --> 18:26.276
As far as y'all were aware, what was it?

18:26.296 --> 18:27.077
It was a whorehouse.

18:27.097 --> 18:27.999
It was?

18:28.779 --> 18:28.960
Okay.

18:29.360 --> 18:30.522
LaGrange and Brenham.

18:31.283 --> 18:31.803
And Brenham?

18:32.004 --> 18:32.785
Yeah.

18:32.845 --> 18:34.807
Brenham or Sealy.

18:34.827 --> 18:35.228
Sealy.

18:37.050 --> 18:37.531
There were two.

18:37.571 --> 18:44.179
Brenham, I think, was Brenham and... Did some Aggies go to the... LaGrange was where the Texas people went.

18:44.193 --> 18:47.577
And Brenham was where the Aggies went.

18:48.238 --> 18:54.865
But apparently in the stage production, Aggies get credit for the chicken ranch.

18:54.885 --> 19:01.333
Because Ann Margaret is, you know, they're doing it in Dallas and Houston now and she gives credit.

19:02.154 --> 19:05.998
All right, back to a football weekend.

19:06.367 --> 19:11.071
So you had Yale practice on a Friday night, then describe the Saturday of a home game.

19:11.091 --> 19:11.712
On a home game?

19:11.832 --> 19:12.472
Of a home game.

19:13.553 --> 19:31.969
Well, of course, we're getting ready for the activities in the morning, and then right after lunch, we'd march into Cowell Field and have the game.

19:32.350 --> 19:35.192
And if we won, which wasn't very often,

19:36.404 --> 19:39.167
We'd try to catch the yell leaders and dump them in the pool.

19:40.989 --> 19:44.794
And then Saturday night was kind of a relaxed time.

19:44.814 --> 19:45.454
Yeah, we were free.

19:47.877 --> 19:51.381
Describe a core trip when there were Saturday classes.

19:52.743 --> 19:53.704
Well, we were excused.

19:54.485 --> 19:54.585
Oh.

19:56.067 --> 19:57.208
Were those classes canceled?

20:00.512 --> 20:01.133
I don't remember.

20:01.633 --> 20:04.977
It must have been canceled because

20:06.560 --> 20:08.222
I just don't remember anything about it.

20:08.362 --> 20:15.168
Describe some of your court trip experiences in the four years.

20:15.188 --> 20:19.793
The worst one was my senior year.

20:21.715 --> 20:33.546
We played over at Austin and I don't know why I was alone, but after we marched and before the game I was walking

20:34.285 --> 20:42.478
probably on the campus but just north of the capital in my boots and I really had an uneasy feeling.

20:43.119 --> 20:47.146
I really felt, that happened to me twice when I was a senior.

20:48.167 --> 20:59.365
One time I was going home and you know we had train service in those days and in Houston

20:59.817 --> 21:06.424
I had a layover between the train from here and the one to South Texas, and I was in my boots.

21:06.464 --> 21:24.404
I don't know why I was wearing my boots, but it was 10, 11, maybe midnight, and I walked out in front of the station, and there used to be that big plaza in front of Union Station there.

21:24.424 --> 21:28.288
Oh no, it wasn't Union Station, it was Southern Pacific Station.

21:30.580 --> 21:34.767
There were some, some blacks out there.

21:34.787 --> 21:39.234
And I, something just told me, get back in the state and get out of here.

21:39.254 --> 21:43.381
Those were two times my senior year when I felt uneasy.

21:44.904 --> 21:52.176
But you ask about experiences, we, uh, um, it's all kind of a blur.

21:52.997 --> 21:55.060
There were enough cars that we could get rides.

21:56.843 --> 21:57.364
And, uh,

21:59.015 --> 22:11.095
It was a thrill to hear the band strike up and march down whichever street it was in your uniform.

22:12.778 --> 22:22.153
Of all the court trips you made, which was your favorite place to go for a court trip, looking back?

22:25.289 --> 22:29.916
I wouldn't say any, I don't have any feel one way or the other.

22:31.639 --> 22:36.747
I had a roommate from Dallas and stayed with them and we went to Dallas.

22:37.348 --> 22:48.907
And then, you know, Waco and TCU and Austin, those were the four.

22:48.927 --> 22:49.828
One year.

22:53.251 --> 22:54.533
May have been freshman year.

22:54.853 --> 22:57.778
We played Villanova in San Antonio.

22:59.901 --> 23:00.662
At the uh.

23:01.964 --> 23:02.605
Alamo Stadium?

23:02.625 --> 23:03.346
Alamo Stadium.

23:05.169 --> 23:06.190
And we marched there.

23:08.033 --> 23:09.415
I knew that was my freshman year.

23:09.916 --> 23:15.564
How did the crowd in any of those cities respond when the A&M Corps was marching down the street?

23:15.585 --> 23:17.407
Oh it was always a big gal.

23:17.427 --> 23:17.808
That's right.

23:17.848 --> 23:18.028
No.

23:18.329 --> 23:19.270
No we weren't.

23:19.290 --> 23:20.592
No meanness then?

23:21.280 --> 23:23.062
And none on the parade route.

23:23.082 --> 23:28.167
No, it was always, oh Houston, we always went to Houston too.

23:29.048 --> 23:35.075
And where did you all have, on a court trip, where did, was there a Saturday night party?

23:35.095 --> 23:36.136
There had to be some fun.

23:38.919 --> 23:40.441
I don't really remember much.

23:43.344 --> 23:46.587
Just, just don't.

23:46.607 --> 23:49.330
Did you have any, did you have any dates that freshman year?

23:49.765 --> 23:50.786
Yes.

23:50.806 --> 23:52.028
Where'd you, how'd you get those dates?

23:56.955 --> 23:57.736
That's for her time.

24:03.984 --> 24:13.056
Well, for the freshman ball, I'd invited a girl from home

24:14.521 --> 24:24.233
and she canceled at the last minute and so I ended up taking Margaret Lemon.

24:24.253 --> 24:33.445
That may have been the only opportunity that I had.

24:34.086 --> 24:36.149
Did you ever have a blind date with a Tessie?

24:36.870 --> 24:37.170
No.

24:38.011 --> 24:42.238
No, didn't know anybody that knew any tests.

24:42.258 --> 24:44.762
A lot of people did have blindness then, didn't they?

24:47.567 --> 24:48.529
Let's go back to class.

24:49.470 --> 24:56.522
As far as you knew, what were the guidelines for classroom dress and behavior and so forth?

25:01.350 --> 25:02.432
Well, of course.

25:03.728 --> 25:05.952
In the Corps that was, that was set.

25:06.112 --> 25:14.926
I mean you wore a uniform to class and you were expected to, to behave yourself the whole time.

25:15.066 --> 25:26.825
Now the veterans dressed it, dressed more casually of course, but nothing like you have today with gimme caps and so forth.

25:29.949 --> 25:30.310
But

25:32.045 --> 25:40.715
Like professors took a role in those days and we were a different generation.

25:41.116 --> 25:47.443
You just didn't question your seniors or your superiors.

25:47.463 --> 25:52.990
You knew what to do, how to behave and never heard of anybody talking back to a prof.

25:53.695 --> 25:54.156
Anything.

25:54.837 --> 25:59.023
So at the, you go home Thanksgiving, how'd you get home?

25:59.624 --> 25:59.985
You remember?

26:00.946 --> 26:01.387
Hitchhiked.

26:02.148 --> 26:05.253
Describe hitchhiking from here to Orange Grove.

26:07.075 --> 26:20.115
Well, you went to west to Giddings and then south through Yoakum and down to Beeville and then to Mathis and Orange Grove.

26:20.516 --> 26:21.337
How did you know where?

26:21.357 --> 26:22.639
Might have three or four

26:23.395 --> 26:27.500
different rides meantime or on the trip.

26:27.520 --> 26:35.369
Of all of your hitchhiking experiences share some happy or and if there were any that weren't happy some experiences of H&M Hitchhiking.

26:36.550 --> 26:40.475
I didn't do that much probably not over four or five times.

26:42.777 --> 26:44.199
I didn't have any bad experiences.

26:44.659 --> 26:47.182
I haven't yet gotten any of them.

26:47.202 --> 26:51.327
In 170 interviews I've not yet heard a bad one.

26:51.458 --> 27:06.199
A fellow in my outfit said that he was picked up somewhere down south of here by a man who made advances on him.

27:06.219 --> 27:08.221
I've had one of those.

27:08.282 --> 27:11.005
That's the only time I ever heard that.

27:11.025 --> 27:16.433
And too much drinking occasionally by the driver of the car and maybe driving fast.

27:16.493 --> 27:17.955
Those are the only bad things.

27:18.205 --> 27:29.742
Yeah I once or twice felt there was some recklessness in it but never really serious.

27:29.762 --> 27:31.084
You always wore your uniform?

27:31.104 --> 27:31.805
Yes oh yes.

27:32.106 --> 27:33.288
Did you put up your thumb?

27:33.628 --> 27:33.808
Yes.

27:34.209 --> 27:35.851
Okay never used a sign?

27:36.853 --> 27:38.555
Sometimes yeah.

27:38.576 --> 27:41.580
And about how long did it take to get from here to Orange Grove normally?

27:44.834 --> 27:54.025
Probably, well, normal time was about five hours, I mean driving, and probably about seven, eight.

27:55.066 --> 27:56.388
Did you ever get stranded anywhere?

27:57.469 --> 27:57.670
No.

27:58.090 --> 27:59.392
Kind of lost or left?

28:01.454 --> 28:01.514
No.

28:01.534 --> 28:04.398
A couple of times thought it would be, but ended up.

28:06.801 --> 28:09.023
Okay, so you go home Thanksgiving.

28:09.043 --> 28:12.968
Do you remember what you said to your family or friends about what it was like?

28:15.884 --> 28:17.708
I really don't.

28:17.728 --> 28:20.553
And were, and those roommates, were they gone by then?

28:21.495 --> 28:23.198
I didn't see them at that time.

28:23.439 --> 28:24.441
No, I mean, were they?

28:24.882 --> 28:26.244
Oh yeah, they left six weeks.

28:26.264 --> 28:28.529
Okay, so are you then by yourself?

28:29.150 --> 28:33.980
Oh no, no, I got another, excuse me, I should have added, they were my original roommates.

28:34.421 --> 28:37.707
The three of us came together and roomed together.

28:38.108 --> 28:42.855
and when they left then the other two that I mentioned earlier became my roommates.

28:42.955 --> 28:51.567
And then you go home Christmas and at the end of the semester in January how did you feel when you got your grades?

28:53.129 --> 28:55.232
Relieved, particularly in that chemistry grade.

28:56.453 --> 29:01.881
And your high school prepared you reasonably well except for the courses they didn't offer?

29:02.422 --> 29:06.968
Well particularly in English and my mother was a very strict

29:08.298 --> 29:12.906
disciplinarian in that sense.

29:12.926 --> 29:14.368
She insisted to learn English.

29:15.871 --> 29:20.038
And you certainly knew that the grades were going to be mailed home.

29:20.479 --> 29:21.441
Oh yes.

29:21.982 --> 29:27.471
Did you change any as a result of your first semester did you change anything academically the second semester?

29:28.132 --> 29:28.333
No.

29:29.475 --> 29:33.341
No I changed outfits went into the Air Force ROTC unit.

29:33.682 --> 29:33.782
Why?

29:35.230 --> 29:37.634
Well, I just preferred the Air Force over the infantry.

29:39.156 --> 29:40.878
Now, did y'all call it Air Force then?

29:40.918 --> 29:41.119
Yes.

29:41.199 --> 29:42.721
Since it was the old Army Air Corps?

29:42.901 --> 29:43.803
It was Air Force by then.

29:43.823 --> 29:45.305
Oh, okay, okay.

29:45.325 --> 29:47.548
Yeah.

29:47.568 --> 29:48.449
Now, what outfit was that?

29:48.910 --> 29:49.551
A Air Force.

29:50.212 --> 29:51.253
And did it have a nickname?

29:52.075 --> 29:52.916
No, we were too new.

29:53.296 --> 29:55.440
Oh, okay.

29:55.460 --> 29:58.644
The Air Force units were formed in January of 47.

29:58.704 --> 30:00.527
Oh, so that's brand new.

30:01.448 --> 30:04.613
And did you Air Force guys think that you were the cream of the crop?

30:08.491 --> 30:10.194
I don't have any feeling that way.

30:10.635 --> 30:14.682
About, do you have any idea what percentage went Air Force?

30:14.702 --> 30:15.724
Probably 10 percent.

30:16.465 --> 30:18.028
I don't think it's more than that.

30:18.048 --> 30:29.128
We had, we had probably five or six outfits so it wasn't a small, small unit, a small group.

30:30.791 --> 30:31.292
Uh, what going on?

30:32.740 --> 30:34.862
Dorm 6, I believe.

30:35.103 --> 30:38.126
So you were still at the, in the new dorms.

30:40.589 --> 30:40.689
Yeah.

30:40.709 --> 30:46.095
Did you all consider them the better dorms than the folks had at Northgate?

30:48.918 --> 30:49.679
I don't remember.

30:50.180 --> 30:51.401
That wasn't a factor.

30:51.622 --> 30:53.584
Any, any field.

30:55.546 --> 30:58.590
See, none of the older, old, old dorms were there.

31:01.833 --> 31:02.494
The,

31:03.301 --> 31:07.227
And there were more veterans that came at mid-year for the second semester.

31:08.608 --> 31:12.614
College View, I presume, was very busy.

31:14.296 --> 31:21.126
And were those old World War II barracks that had been moved from somewhere?

31:22.188 --> 31:23.630
They were moved, yeah.

31:23.650 --> 31:24.651
And we had them on.
