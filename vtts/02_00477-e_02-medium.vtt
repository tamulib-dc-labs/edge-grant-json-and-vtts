WEBVTT

00:01.567 --> 00:10.520
And he said, my idea of democracy is that that is a 
government run by the people and for the people.

00:11.321 --> 00:16.889
And I said, that's

00:11.321 --> 00:16.889
very close to my views, sir. He said, well, then 
tell me, how can you run a democracy in a country

00:18.011 --> 00:30.088
where 87% of the people can't participate. Our 
literacy rate, 87% can't read and write. How can

00:41.263 --> 00:42.644
they participate?

00:45.488 --> 00:47.931
So they need to be told, they need to be led. So what 
we're trying here is democracy for 13% of the

00:49.693 --> 00:57.223
people and 87% zero, nothing. but yet your country 
demands that we do that in order for us to get aid and

00:59.684 --> 01:29.590
he says I'm going to take over this government

00:59.684 --> 01:29.590
and I said he said I'm going to follow the 
principles in which you have outlined here today

00:59.684 --> 01:29.590
even to moving the troops I laid out to him I laid out 
to him a

00:59.684 --> 01:29.590
principle of first off, if you're going to take 
over a country and want the support of outside

01:30.532 --> 01:39.641
influence, don't kill anybody unless you have to. 
It must be, you just don't do it. I said, I will judge

01:45.106 --> 01:52.813
your success by the number of people that you don't 
kill. He said, I understand. I said, that's you'll

01:59.067 --> 02:03.554
get internal support and you'll get external 
support if you don't do that.

02:06.759 --> 02:21.904
I said another principle is the disposed

02:06.759 --> 02:21.904
should be handled in such a way that that they exist 
after this is all over with. I said Another thing is

02:25.392 --> 02:46.236
grab the communication center and start talking 
to the people and tell them exactly what you're

02:25.392 --> 02:46.236
doing and why because they deserve the right to 
know why you're doing this and what you expect what

02:25.392 --> 02:46.236
they should expect from the outcome.

02:57.505 --> 03:25.200
We went through where the key communication 
centers are, Karachi and Lahore, and what the

02:57.505 --> 03:25.200
likely things to do in Dhaka at that time, because 
you had East Pakistan, where to dispose your

02:57.505 --> 03:25.200
soldiers, support you should ask for from the, 
from the malas, from the leaders in the villages

02:57.505 --> 03:25.200
who, from where the soldiers come, mostly.

03:32.217 --> 03:58.326
opposition politicians don't let them don't lock 
them up unless it's absolutely necessary but if

03:32.217 --> 03:58.326
they do start interfering lock them up don't 
punish them just lock them up get them out of the way

03:32.217 --> 03:58.326
until you get yourself stabilized

03:32.217 --> 03:58.326
after about four hours He was satisfied. This was 
on March the 6th, 1958.

04:08.607 --> 04:19.737
And he said to me, he said,

04:08.607 --> 04:19.737
if you want to tell my friend Alan Dulles, you feel 
free to do this.

04:23.880 --> 04:25.282
Did you tell the head of the CIA? Yes. What did he, 
how did he respond? He said, you have a military

04:31.498 --> 04:34.421
mind and it isn't going to happen. That's what he 
said to the general or to you? Said to me. He wrote

04:42.451 --> 04:43.793
back and said that? Yes. You have a military mind 
and it's not going to happen? Yeah, and that was

04:47.958 --> 04:55.988
also a reaction of the political newspaper 
Eisenhower appointee ambassador. Who was the

04:58.263 --> 05:01.566
ambassador at that time? He was a sad one, but I 
can't think of his name. He ended up in a newspaper

05:03.909 --> 05:06.211
out in New Hampshire. Oh my God. He had an alcoholic 
wife. I can't think of a worse selection to

05:15.901 --> 05:23.308
represent a president anywhere than he was, but I 
can't remember his name. Why do you say that? He was

05:24.939 --> 05:26.120
just totally inept? Well, I think inept is he knew 
nothing about what? About Pakistan. Yeah. Just

05:37.917 --> 05:39.259
political appointee. Kind

05:41.121 --> 05:50.414
of like you said, you know, we won't discuss this 
anymore. He said, I'd like to Feel free to come talk

05:53.798 --> 05:58.924
to you on this, Mary Ann, in case I need to. I said, 
yes, sir. Well, you must have had an Air Force

06:02.208 --> 06:10.658
colonel there and a MAG team, and you must have had 
an AP, a captain probably, didn't you? Yeah,

06:10.678 --> 06:12.380
right. And did you inform those people? Did you 
talk to those people about this? No way. No way.

06:19.955 --> 06:22.678
They weren't as close to the general as you were, 
obviously. Oh, there wasn't anybody in the

06:22.698 --> 06:26.402
country as close as I was to IU. Well, why do you—why 
you? I mean, how did this come about? Well, we were

06:30.467 --> 06:35.773
1,200 miles away from everybody else and he had 
confidence in mobility.

06:38.877 --> 06:41.420
Because the others were in Dhaka? The others were 
in Karachi. Oh, okay. That's where the MAG

06:45.725 --> 06:47.667
headquarters was. And we saw each other almost 
every day, not every day, but that's the reason for

06:49.165 --> 06:58.637
it. I told the mag chief. He said, I don't believe 
it. Who was the mag chief? He was a brigadier

07:04.464 --> 07:05.846
general? No, he was a major general. He's still 
alive. I know you're making him look bad. Okay, he

07:12.495 --> 07:14.097
didn't believe it. And the CIA didn't believe it. 
The CIA didn't believe it. Army attache said, I'll

07:19.490 --> 07:26.898
report it, but

07:19.490 --> 07:26.898
I can't think it'll happen. So,

07:28.440 --> 07:33.565
thank you, ma'am. So, that cup, I guess. Thank you 
very much, Mr. Donaldson. So,

07:38.491 --> 07:48.141
you use sugar in this? No, thank you, sir.

07:55.720 --> 08:13.443
I don't need to tell you this, but when you see the 
13th Lancers moving to where you said they should

07:55.720 --> 08:13.443
move

07:55.720 --> 08:13.443
on a training exercise, then you'll know things 
are imminent. So on the 5th of October, the 13th

08:13.463 --> 08:20.412
Lancers moved from Queda to Multan.

08:24.526 --> 08:30.852
was scheduled to go to visit that regiment in 
Queda.

08:33.594 --> 08:37.938
And we got a call on the 4th of March. Now wait a 
minute, you're in first, you said March. I mean

08:43.463 --> 08:44.664
October. You were in October, right? I'm talking 
about October. Okay, the first meeting was in

08:46.386 --> 08:47.887
March. March the 6th. Yes, and okay, and so now. So 
then on the 5th of October,

08:55.947 --> 09:08.761
The 13th Lancers moved to Multan, and on the 4th of 
October, we got a message from the headquarters at

08:55.947 --> 09:08.761
GHQ, which we were a part of. We had a building there 
in the general headquarters of the Pakistani

09:09.102 --> 09:15.249
forces. We got this message requesting us to delay 
our visit to the 13th Lancers. because they had

09:22.947 --> 09:28.656
U.S. equipment, you see, and we'd go inspect it to 
see how well they were doing about their training.

09:28.976 --> 09:37.189
So

09:28.976 --> 09:37.189
my deputy, Lieutenant Colonel Watson, said, I 
can't understand. We ought to go back and

09:37.449 --> 09:43.279
intercede here. We've got a schedule set up, and 
we've got to follow this schedule. I said, no, they

09:46.704 --> 09:51.351
don't want us to go out there at this time, so we're 
not going. Did you tell your deputy about your

09:52.917 --> 09:55.460
earlier conversation? Oh, no, I never told 
anybody. Just Dulles? Pass the word to Allen

09:59.745 --> 10:01.387
Dulles.

10:03.889 --> 10:09.756
And

10:03.889 --> 10:09.756
I did that through the ambassador. Yeah. But then 
word never got to Allen Dulles. Oh, really? No.

10:17.204 --> 10:19.106
Word never got to the United States. I thought you 
said earlier that no one believed you. They

10:22.921 --> 10:23.542
didn't. Ambassador didn't believe me. But you 
gave the word to the ambassador. He was supposed to

10:26.645 --> 10:28.907
report to Washington. Absolutely. He never did 
report this. No. So neither did the MAG chief.

10:39.058 --> 10:40.040
As far as I know. Or if they did, they just cast it 
aside. So at 2 o'clock in the morning on the 6th of

10:45.165 --> 10:51.612
October, a coup came.

10:56.063 --> 11:06.376
I talked to now Prime Minister, President IU many 
times thereafter.

11:06.396 --> 11:22.898
He said, you know, he said, Holly, one of the most 
critical times in my life was when I called the

11:06.396 --> 11:22.898
Commonwealth of Nations and the ambassadors of 
the United States together at 2 o'clock in the

11:06.396 --> 11:22.898
morning to tell them what was going on.

11:27.957 --> 11:40.514
and said, right down the line, the ambassador from 
Australia said,

11:27.957 --> 11:40.514
President Ayub, you have my country's total 
support. Great Britain, you have my country,

11:42.256 --> 11:47.063
ambassador, you have my country's total support. 
New Zealand, all the way right on down the line.

11:49.686 --> 11:51.128
Canada. Come to the United States. And that 
ambassador said, Well, what happened to Umrah?

12:00.926 --> 12:03.068
Why wasn't Umrah promoted? Well, now listen to 
this. Umrah is either a brigadier general or a

12:06.491 --> 12:26.668
major general over command in a division in East 
Pakistan in which our intelligence agencies and

12:06.491 --> 12:26.668
so on and so forth thinks a real great guy. How do you 
spell his name? Umrah, U-V-M-H-R-O. And

12:30.711 --> 12:35.757
they were sold on, this guy. Yeah, and here, and 
General Ayub says, Ollie, here at a time of crisis,

12:35.778 --> 12:55.221
and all the important ambassadors and all the 
support I needed, that I needed, I get from one of

12:35.778 --> 12:55.221
the prime countries in the world,

12:57.783 --> 13:04.632
a question as to why I didn't promote some general 
officer. Said, this is unbelievable.

13:13.965 --> 13:18.250
I said, Mr. President, I'm not surprised. And

13:18.270 --> 13:23.217
I wasn't surprised. I can't think of that joker's 
name. We've had so many jokers as ambassadors,

13:26.217 --> 13:31.184
political appointees, you know, all over the 
place.

13:34.689 --> 13:37.773
God, I can't think of his name now. It's so 
insignificant that you try not to remember the

13:38.454 --> 13:47.787
insignificance, you know, because there's so 
many important things and so many good people to

13:38.454 --> 13:47.787
remember.

13:53.572 --> 14:03.441
Write

13:53.572 --> 14:03.441
to the letter and I congratulated him after he was 
all over with. Only one guy was killed and as the

14:04.122 --> 14:21.317
light tanks of the 13th Lancers were moving in 
Karachi

14:04.122 --> 14:21.317
to the radio station They excited a camel cart and 
the camels broke loose and run over the camel

14:23.187 --> 14:38.804
driver in the street with a wagon and killed him, 
not from gunfire.

14:39.044 --> 14:46.292
He took Iskander Mirza, who was the prime 
minister, his whole family, whole household, his

14:39.044 --> 14:46.292
whole group of kids this and that and all kinds of 
hands and all that loaded them in the airplane and

14:46.880 --> 14:55.213
sent them to England and they're still in England.

15:04.447 --> 15:09.554
How long did he lock up any opposing political 
parties, leaders? Uh, you know believe it or not I

15:10.656 --> 15:14.642
think he had the general respect and support of 
those people and it wasn't until he began to get

15:15.550 --> 15:39.206
sick and he was failing in health

15:15.550 --> 15:39.206
until he got a little bit cross purposes with some 
of the civilian people over there. When you've got

15:39.226 --> 15:44.494
a country of 14 or 15 different damn parties and no 
leadership amongst any of them. What a shambles.

15:50.269 --> 15:59.544
Mrs.

15:50.269 --> 15:59.544
IU was still living.

16:06.575 --> 16:12.945
And is that why you've maintained very close 
contacts with the military? in Pakistan and why

16:13.162 --> 16:21.450
you go back every once in a while and talk to the new 
president? I guess so. The new president was a

16:22.771 --> 16:27.215
major in what they called a guides cavalry. That 
was probably the most famous cavalry unit in the

16:27.295 --> 16:31.079
world. It was British, Pakistani, British 
Indian, and then Pakistani.

16:44.347 --> 16:51.917
President Zia was a major in the Guides Cavalry, 
and I'm very fond of those officers there. The

16:51.977 --> 17:12.565
Pakistan Military Academy is a two-year academy 
patterned after Sandhurst, and they do a

16:51.977 --> 17:12.565
tremendous job in selecting people for PMA, and 
for the curriculum there is followed almost

16:51.977 --> 17:12.565
completely. but with nationalistic conditions.

17:19.099 --> 17:21.783
But fighting after the British was one of the best. 
Did you have any mixed feelings about your

17:22.363 --> 17:25.328
dealings? For a couple of reasons. First, you're a 
military representative and not a political

17:28.452 --> 17:38.586
representative or usually military mag 
personnel. deal somewhat in politics, but not

17:39.055 --> 17:58.836
very much, and second, you are a representative of 
a country that's always attempting to export

17:39.055 --> 17:58.836
democracy, and so proud of its democracy, and here 
what you're doing eventually leads to the end of a

17:39.055 --> 17:58.836
democracy, even though it was a weak one, and the 
rise of a dictatorship. Did you have any mixed

17:58.896 --> 18:00.958
feelings about your role? No, because you just had 
to You have to take our foreign policy

18:07.810 --> 18:30.730
and you just cannot

18:07.810 --> 18:30.730
allow it to destroy the common sense aspects of a 
democracy.

18:32.552 --> 18:35.995
You can't be, you can't allow a democracy to be so 
damn foolish

18:37.021 --> 19:04.518
and so damn wrong that you make our whole country 
look bad in trying to implement that policy in a

18:37.021 --> 19:04.518
part of the world where there isn't a single person 
with any common sense and sound judgment knows

18:37.021 --> 19:04.518
that that's what's right for that country and 
their people. You just can't do that.

19:13.252 --> 19:40.373
for people who are not schooled who can't handle it

19:13.252 --> 19:40.373
and that's what we have consistently done and this 
is where I'm consistently opposed to this sort of

19:13.252 --> 19:40.373
thing now we tried our best he said what are you how 
do you get around this business of democracy here

19:13.252 --> 19:40.373
now and when we're trying to do something for these 
people

19:43.137 --> 19:51.165
I said, well, you've got to keep preaching 
democracy at the same time and practice it at every

19:43.137 --> 19:51.165
instant that you possibly can.

19:54.288 --> 19:59.814
But at the same time, do something to enhance the 
welfare of the mass of the people in this country.

20:01.876 --> 20:03.398
And I said, I think you can do it. I think you can take 
over this country without denying the rights of

20:03.418 --> 20:12.267
everyone. And I said, avoid that, denying the 
rights people deserve. Now, some people don't

20:18.465 --> 20:21.229
deserve any rights.

20:25.314 --> 20:29.460
Some people display themselves in such a fashion 
they don't deserve any rights.

20:36.390 --> 20:42.338
Does a criminal deserve a right to run up and down 
the streets out here shooting at people and so on

20:36.390 --> 20:42.338
and so forth? What kind of rights was that? Don't 
you think that you deserve a right to walk up and

20:45.949 --> 20:52.338
down the streets of Dallas after midnight without 
being shot at? Huh? Can you get that? Is that right

20:55.682 --> 20:58.106
available to you today? I hope so. But it isn't. 
Probably. You understand? Yeah, I understand.

21:05.556 --> 21:09.962
You see what I'm talking about? So, uh... You know, 
I like to look at these countries like this. What's

21:19.176 --> 21:20.779
best for the country? Yeah, okay. What's best for 
the country? Now, after the general became the

21:24.926 --> 21:34.403
president and took over the country, tell me about 
your relationship with him then. They more or less

21:34.423 --> 21:38.110
ceased because he was out of them. military role 
other than commander-in-chief and they more or

21:38.680 --> 21:48.292
less dropped off except for social and for well 
hunting and that sort of stuff. He would still

21:48.352 --> 22:05.093
invite me to go with him hunting and so forth but we 
never sat down and had any military conferences

21:48.352 --> 22:05.093
because now you got a new commander-in-chief, 
General Musa, M-U-S-A, who was his deputy and he

21:48.352 --> 22:05.093
was promoted to the commander-in-chief. So then 
my relationship switched directly to General

22:05.360 --> 22:11.265
Moussa again. That's the way we worked at it. So, in 
other words, you didn't advise him? No, none at

22:16.430 --> 22:17.411
all. None at all. After he became president and 
prime minister, he moved to Karachi,

22:18.853 --> 22:33.426
where the seat of the government was, and I had no 
more official contact with him on his social.

22:41.680 --> 22:53.556
One might think that he might offer you some sort of 
a position behind the scenes with the government,

22:41.680 --> 22:53.556
but he never did. No, and he knew that I wouldn't 
accept it anyway because he was as much a soldier as

22:53.936 --> 23:01.346
I am. He knew. He knows what the rules are. Well, I 
meant, you know, as an alternative to your

23:04.844 --> 23:11.731
military career. Oh, well. Like General 
Chenault, working for China. Yeah. Before.

23:19.379 --> 23:21.421
Right, sure, sure. That never happened in my life. 
Okay, okay. I was wondering about an issue that

23:29.189 --> 23:33.653
happened earlier, but one that relates to the idea 
of who is commander-in-chief, the politician or

23:34.291 --> 23:47.387
the general, and that is the General MacArthur and 
Harry Truman episode. It does have some parallels

23:49.610 --> 23:53.795
here to what happened in Pakistan. What was your 
feeling on that episode? Did you think Truman

23:57.360 --> 24:00.163
acted correctly?

24:06.286 --> 24:14.793
The president,

24:06.286 --> 24:14.793
by law, is a commander-in-chief. I'm a 
law-abiding person and I believe in a civilian

24:14.913 --> 24:29.886
rule and I believe in a political two-party 
system. I hope we don't get many more parties than

24:31.588 --> 24:35.331
that. I believe in our whole Constitution, the 
whole layout, all aspects of it.

24:45.595 --> 24:52.162
That doesn't mean that there may be some portion of 
it that may come up sometime that needs to be

24:45.595 --> 24:52.162
changed. I'm not against change, but I am against 
just change for change's sake. I think there must

24:59.891 --> 25:06.718
be a good specific reason that's impacting 
unfavorably on them on the totality of our people

25:07.002 --> 25:13.832
before you go change the Constitution, of course. 
But I've always looked up to the president, and

25:13.852 --> 25:35.642
always will, and I stand by whatever decision he 
makes, and I hope that he provides me an

25:13.852 --> 25:35.642
opportunity, if I'm in the right position, to 
participate before the decision is made. and

25:37.428 --> 26:02.710
express my views one way or the other through now 
the members of the Congress or by written word or

25:37.428 --> 26:02.710
oral or whatever it might be but after the decision 
is made I think that everybody must

25:37.428 --> 26:02.710
this is what I believe democracy is is 
participating But after the decision is made,

26:03.837 --> 26:08.102
then you support the higher authority. And I think 
a general, I think anybody can serve too long

26:10.145 --> 26:30.891
and become too over-viewed

26:10.145 --> 26:30.891
with his presence.

26:34.465 --> 26:37.348
publicly or officially.

26:41.633 --> 26:48.241
And I think General MacArthur was long overdue for 
retirement.

26:53.166 --> 27:00.034
And

26:53.166 --> 27:00.034
I would have thought that his better judgment 
might have dictated that to him.

27:04.503 --> 27:08.067
So, I support Mr. Truman one thousand percent.

27:11.071 --> 27:27.591
If a man doesn't come up and say, it's obvious Mr. 
President, you and I are not getting along here,

27:11.071 --> 27:27.591
I'm going to step down because I know you're not and 
let's do this very quietly and get on with it, okay?

27:32.836 --> 27:34.338
What's wrong with that approach? After 50 years in 
the uniform, you're supposed to leave at the end of

27:35.520 --> 27:40.788
30.

27:45.575 --> 27:50.743
So, I support President Truman. Okay. Now, why'd 
you leave Pakistan? Your tour of duty was up.

27:56.152 --> 27:58.455
Usually it's a two mags, or usually two years. Your 
duty is up, and I was a colonel, and I was due for

27:59.296 --> 28:02.901
command. Okay, okay. And you got a deputy 
commander, Combat Company A. Combat Company A,

28:09.609 --> 28:12.172
1st Armored Division. Where was that? That was at 
Fort Hood. Okay. Fort Hood, and then you had that

28:16.417 --> 28:24.568
for about nine months, and then you became Chief of 
Staff of the 2nd Armored Division, also at Fort

28:16.417 --> 28:24.568
Hood. Right. That was my old World War II division. 
Okay. Okay. What were you doing there, training?

28:32.289 --> 28:36.834
Training completely, totally training, right. 
We had a full division there, and we were training

28:36.894 --> 28:43.743
in Europe. The division at the time I was there was 
scheduled for Europe, and we were putting forth

28:43.803 --> 28:59.323
all of our efforts toward deployment to that area 
in case of a national emergency.

29:01.362 --> 29:05.306
Okay, and then in August of 1961, you got a new 
assignment. Was that because Kennedy was

29:05.346 --> 29:08.148
elected? Yes, yes. Now tell me how that came about. 
Well that came about after I had completed this

29:11.311 --> 29:20.300
year or 18 months down there at Fort Hood. It came 
about that then I have to go to high staff, highest

29:21.181 --> 29:26.386
level staff. That's what I'm scheduled for next.

29:33.003 --> 30:02.554
high-level staff at the cabinet level, and so I was 
selected, approved by the Secretary of Defense to

29:33.003 --> 30:02.554
come to high-level staff positions, and after out 
there a little while, and then I became,

29:33.003 --> 30:02.554
they were satisfied, then that's when I was given 
the political appointee slot.

30:04.745 --> 30:28.778
And one of the key

30:04.745 --> 30:28.778
points there during that four years was Cuban 
Crisis, in which I was involved in the manpower

30:04.745 --> 30:28.778
aspects of that and the calling of the reserves.

30:29.078 --> 30:36.925
Okay, so you were Deputy Assistant Secretary of 
Defense for Reserve and Manpower from August 1962

30:29.078 --> 30:36.925
until October 1965. Right. Okay, let's start off 
right away. Your boss is, who is your immediate

30:40.668 --> 30:43.391
supervisor? My immediate supervisor is 
Assistant Secretary of Defense Norman Paul,

30:43.551 --> 30:50.277
P-A-U-L.

30:52.138 --> 30:56.602
Okay, and of course his boss is McNamara. His boss 
is McNamara. Okay, now there's a heck of a lot of

30:58.087 --> 31:10.846
controversy about McNamara, and sometimes I hear 
from many generals their dislike for McNamara.

31:10.886 --> 31:16.535
Some people have surprised me and told me what a 
wonderful guy he was. He's very controversial.

31:18.718 --> 31:19.840
You worked with him closely. What's your opinion? 
Well, I thought that Mr. McNamara was a very smart

31:27.837 --> 31:56.528
man who

31:27.837 --> 31:56.528
was taking on a hundred billion dollar or more 
operation,

31:27.837 --> 31:56.528
who was trying his damnedest to bring some sense of 
management to an unmanageable organization

31:58.128 --> 32:26.295
wherein you have three services fighting each 
other for a few dollars and that

31:58.128 --> 32:26.295
would not, even if they got all of it, would not 
satisfy the total requirement.

32:32.384 --> 32:50.342
A job that,

32:32.384 --> 32:50.342
well I can't think of a tougher job than being 
Secretary of Defense other than being President

32:32.384 --> 32:50.342
of the United States. And McNamara

32:52.064 --> 32:59.792
received much criticism, very little praise.

33:02.388 --> 33:31.230
But overall,

33:02.388 --> 33:31.230
you have to give the man credit for fostering what 
the Colonel DeVolt had attempted to do by starting

33:02.388 --> 33:31.230
to build a conventional deterrent and to maintain 
some balance in the strategic deterrent and

33:33.134 --> 33:59.901
modernizing the theater nuclear deterrent and at 
the same time fighting a war in Vietnam and trying

33:33.134 --> 33:59.901
to fight that war and his theory was we ought to end 
that war

33:33.134 --> 33:59.901
with not one nickel spent beyond what it cost to run 
that war in other words When the war is over, when

34:00.843 --> 34:11.014
the ceasefire comes, or whatever it is, whoever 
wins, loses, or draws, the inventory should be

34:00.843 --> 34:11.014
zero at that point in time. Of course, that's where 
I disagreed with him, because that indicates that

34:11.194 --> 34:22.847
that is the last of all wars, in which it's wrong, in 
which your security capability drops back to

34:11.194 --> 34:22.847
zero. And you can't afford that. But that's the 
dollar aspect of it. What kind of person was he? Can

34:35.332 --> 34:40.658
you give me sort of a description of his character?

34:40.678 --> 34:42.680
I think he liked a lot of independence. He didn't 
like too many people around. I think he

34:45.142 --> 34:54.992
had utter disregard for people. I mean he had no 
sense of feeling for people at all. They were just

34:58.673 --> 35:00.115
something else. They were tools.

35:04.662 --> 35:12.274
No sense of feeling for people, and no sense of 
respect for the political side of America. He

35:12.294 --> 35:22.850
thought the politicians are all little gimmicks, 
or he thought of things, you know,

35:12.294 --> 35:22.850
insignificance, and that sort of thing. And that 
caused him a lot of misery. But that's, when you

35:26.415 --> 35:27.617
treat them, When you treat the politicians as a 
bunch of little kids, you know, that you can slap

35:28.222 --> 35:40.754
and kick around, or dogs, that's what you get. 
You're asking for it. Absolutely. And he got it.

35:46.920 --> 35:47.921
But I liked the man. He never harmed me. He'd only 
help. He had very high standards of performance.

35:58.495 --> 36:01.458
And anybody that performed well stayed there. 
General Haig was there as lieutenant colonel. I

36:07.003 --> 36:08.084
was there as a colonel. Alexander Haig was there as 
a lieutenant colonel? Oh yeah. Oh yeah. He worked

36:15.431 --> 36:21.957
for Mr. Joe Califano, who was chief special 
assistant to Mr. McNamara. And that's when I

36:21.977 --> 36:25.941
learned, that's when I knew Joe Califano. What did 
you think of him? Just one hell of a guy. Smart, just

36:30.958 --> 36:34.202
a tremendous guy. What did you think of Haig? 
Phenomenal lieutenant commander and battalion

36:36.946 --> 36:42.914
commander. He was one of my battalion commanders 
in Vietnam in my division, Division G3, Chief of

36:42.954 --> 36:51.646
Operations as a lieutenant colonel. And he was 
really good? Oh, absolutely. Absolutely best.

36:58.216 --> 36:59.939
Absolutely the best. Why? Smart, very intense 
from the standpoint of learning and retention,

37:01.601 --> 37:21.191
burning desire to succeed, warm personality, 
respectful of others, seniors and subordinates

37:01.601 --> 37:21.191
alike. Hello, man. I saw him there. Oh, you did? Oh, 
yeah. He invited me over to his house. I went over to

37:30.771 --> 37:31.733
see him. I spent about 45 minutes with him. Oh, 
where is he? He's in Washington. He may eventually

37:36.919 --> 37:42.266
be in Texas.

37:42.286 --> 37:45.490
Why do you say that? He may say, he could, you know, 
accept a position down here someplace.

37:55.163 --> 37:55.223
Um, He was a hell of a guy, a hell of a battalion 
commander.

38:01.046 --> 38:06.092
I know he was promoted because of his relations 
with politicians. He was promoted over about,

38:06.112 --> 38:10.838
what, two or three hundred senior people. Oh, 
yeah. Was there some envy or jealousy or

38:12.660 --> 38:15.444
grumbling? Always some. Always, yeah, always 
some. Like the President's Chief of Staff. He's

38:21.231 --> 38:22.592
out of Class of 50. Shire Meyer, he was The black 
secretary jumped him over several hundred.

38:35.865 --> 38:41.493
Those things happened.

38:41.513 --> 38:55.332
But again,

38:41.513 --> 38:55.332
you see, you must support the system and the 
authority of the President of the United States or

38:41.513 --> 38:55.332
you've got nothing. you have absolutely nothing 
and no security you've got to do that within the

38:56.712 --> 39:04.864
armed forces. Now let's talk about this job 
itself. You're in a political position here.

39:12.336 --> 39:16.142
You're an assistant secretary. This is, you know, 
the deputy secretary or assistant secretary is—

39:24.050 --> 39:25.371
political appointee. That's true. And not a 
military position. This is really rare in

39:28.996 --> 39:33.561
American history. That's true. This might be the 
first case. You must have had, being in this

39:38.626 --> 39:49.579
political slot, and being a colonel, you must have 
had generals who were superior. Is that not true?

39:52.021 --> 39:52.622
That's true. I'm surprised you didn't have to 
resign your commission for this.

40:01.987 --> 40:06.051
Tell me about the difficulty that you had, or the 
position itself. I tell you, I guess

40:06.071 --> 40:21.748
that it does seem

40:06.071 --> 40:21.748
somewhat

40:25.593 --> 40:27.176
out of order in the system.

40:30.281 --> 40:41.639
However,

40:30.281 --> 40:41.639
I guess it's the techniques you use and how you 
avoid disorder and try to gain confidence and

40:30.281 --> 40:41.639
cooperation.

40:45.145 --> 40:48.090
And I've prepared many memorandums. 
particularly on the reserves, and sent to the

40:48.762 --> 41:08.271
Secretary of the Army, and the Navy, and the Air 
Force, and which were directive in nature that the

40:48.762 --> 41:08.271
four-star generals and the three-star generals 
probably didn't like worth a damn. But all they had

41:08.291 --> 41:16.002
to do was to complain to their secretary, and he 
could go complain to Mr. McNamara and get thrown

41:08.291 --> 41:16.002
out

41:19.660 --> 41:48.368
so you see when you ask me about Mr. McNamara

41:19.660 --> 41:48.368
when you work for him and he supports you you have 
his loyalty and respect and confidence you just

41:19.660 --> 41:48.368
get on with it and whether they like it or not

41:19.660 --> 41:48.368
and come up number 66 on three brigadier lists and 
they only go down and promote 64 each year, you

41:48.820 --> 41:51.703
know, for three years. You can be on the damn list, 
and they'd throw the list out and start all over.

41:56.549 --> 41:57.470
And is that what happened? There's some of the 
things that happened, yeah. Well, tell me about

41:59.472 --> 42:00.273
that. You were numbers, when you came up for 
Brigadier General, you were number 66 on the list?

42:05.819 --> 42:16.110
Yeah, first time, and they promoted down to number 
63, I guess, and they threw the list out. you know,

42:16.327 --> 42:18.590
for next year and start all over. So, a new board 
comes in with slates

42:18.751 --> 42:31.971
and you end up maybe this year number 65 or 
something and they only promote 60. That's all the

42:33.053 --> 42:34.855
slots that come open. So, you come up again for 
promotion. You only come up about four times. And

42:43.749 --> 42:45.051
you come up every year? Yeah, you come up every year 
for four years for the general officer. And then

42:51.894 --> 42:58.948
last time you come up and you're number two on the 
list. You get promoted almost immediately when

42:58.968 --> 43:02.074
the list comes up. And so that's what happened. 
That could be some praise.

43:16.300 --> 43:19.725
Oh, God, you know, I don't complain about that. I 
know about all that sort

43:19.745 --> 43:24.433
of stuff. In other words, Mr. McNamara was really 
happy with the quality of work that you were doing.

43:29.821 --> 43:31.824
Yeah, he was very happy. In fact, I had my first 
Distinguished Service Medal, my first medal that

43:31.884 --> 43:43.843
they normally reserve for general officers, 
which is the highest award you can get in service,

43:31.884 --> 43:43.843
Distinguished Service Medal. was when I was a 
colonel.

43:53.545 --> 44:03.018
Why do you think that you were, when you first came 
up, the first time you came up for general, why do

43:53.545 --> 44:03.018
you think that you were number 66? Especially 
considering your career. Yeah, I think because

44:07.364 --> 44:13.172
whoever was on that board, whoever the six 
generals were on that board liked 65 guys better

44:15.430 --> 44:18.296
than they did me. Maybe one of those guys on the 
board, I don't know, was the one that I forced a

44:19.418 --> 44:28.638
memorandum down his throat to get something done 
that he didn't like. You see what I mean? That's all

44:30.602 --> 44:32.666
it takes. Records be damned. Records be damned.

44:39.089 --> 45:02.464
he could have said to the other five boards I 
wouldn't promote that son of a bitch he sends a

44:39.089 --> 45:02.464
goddamn memorandum down here raising hell with us 
on this that and the other because we did this wrong

44:39.089 --> 45:02.464
that wrong I wouldn't promote that bastard for 
anything and the others say well I don't know him

44:39.089 --> 45:02.464
but he's got a hell of a good record right hell with 
his record

44:39.089 --> 45:02.464
you know It's, you know, what we're doing here is 
dealing with people. Sure, right. And I don't

45:11.845 --> 45:14.553
blame a damn bit. Who do you think I am?
