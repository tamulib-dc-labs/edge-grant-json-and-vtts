WEBVTT

00:02.984 --> 00:08.833
That's the great big overall single thing. This 
air movement is the one specific thing. Okay,

00:13.320 --> 00:17.066
let's talk about the air movement that you were 
telling me about yesterday. But first I have a

00:17.147 --> 00:18.429
question. Now, you had about 1,600 men in your 
battalion. Well, we had more than that when we got

00:26.609 --> 00:30.194
into this place. Okay, when you commanded, how 
many men were under your command? Well, at one

00:33.598 --> 00:35.681
time, there were about 4,500. About 4,500? 4,500. 
And you took those men and you divided them into

00:37.463 --> 00:44.872
groups, and then you sent them out. That's right. 
And how large was each group? It depended on the

00:48.136 --> 00:49.238
mission. And it sort of depended on the 
organization. A battalion... usually works best

00:56.242 --> 01:25.708
as a battalion yeah now there there were separate 
company types in the unit there were some

00:56.242 --> 01:25.708
detachments there were some groups and it 
depended on on what the mission was and where they

00:56.242 --> 01:25.708
went we might send the group headquarters to go 
along with two of its battalions to a particular

00:56.242 --> 01:25.708
place and then another part of his as a group staff 
would take the other battalion on a subsequent

01:27.123 --> 01:36.055
mission or a mission at the same time somewhere 
else. We not only divided our staff into this

01:36.255 --> 01:54.379
diversified operation, we took our subordinate 
units, which were groups and battalions, and had

01:36.255 --> 01:54.379
them do the same thing to the degree that they were 
capable of. Now, the lower the type headquarters

01:54.983 --> 01:58.988
you get, the less you can split it up. In other 
words, you couldn't split a company headquarters

01:59.689 --> 02:05.856
and let its company go hither and yonder, 
battalion less so. A group can do more so, and a

02:06.737 --> 02:11.142
brigade could do it to a great degree. So it 
depended on who and where and what the mission was.

02:16.388 --> 02:17.229
There was no pattern. It sounds to me that this 
would really increase the officers' desire and

02:25.443 --> 02:27.625
motivation. Absolutely. Because they'd have 
response. Your junior officers or your middle

02:30.187 --> 02:39.935
grade officers would have much more 
responsibility on their own than if they were just

02:30.187 --> 02:39.935
under the general's command. Absolutely. We 
utilized many of our staff officers just as I think

02:42.277 --> 02:47.802
the T.O. and E. envisioned them. For instance, 
we'd go ahead of everybody else to summer camp.

02:55.025 --> 02:57.187
We'd go to the brigade headquarters. And we 
started going to Fort Bullis, which is out of San

02:58.288 --> 03:02.333
Antonio. We went there, and we didn't busy 
ourselves at all with this year's mission. We went

03:11.482 --> 03:14.686
there and looked at next year's mission. We were 
the big planner. We planned the big picture for

03:16.968 --> 03:20.031
next year. And the reason we went there, right next 
door to 4th Army, who was our operating

03:25.012 --> 03:27.575
headquarter. In other words, we were under Fourth 
Army. And they were in control of all these areas,

03:29.838 --> 03:34.003
see. They could say, you can go here, you can go 
yonder, these people. In other words, they were

03:37.908 --> 03:40.091
our headquarter. So we satellited right outside 
of San Antonio where we could plan next year's big

03:40.111 --> 03:46.298
picture. And then when one of the groups, for 
instance, would go to Fort Bullis or, I mean, Fort

03:50.476 --> 04:17.277
Sill or Fort Chaffee, then I'd attach one of my 
staff officers to summer camp with that group to

03:50.476 --> 04:17.277
speak for the headquarters, to be the 
reconnaissance officer for the headquarters or

03:50.476 --> 04:17.277
to interpret plans or really just to be there 
They're contacted with the brigade

04:17.780 --> 04:20.743
headquarters. But here's the group commander out 
there. He's operating. He's the sole commander

04:25.108 --> 04:26.970
there. He's running the show. And we've all gone 
back home. Now, each one of these satellite

04:33.056 --> 04:43.447
operations, and I'd go and visit them or my deputy a 
day or a half a day or whatever just to see what was

04:33.056 --> 04:43.447
going on. But we always had one of our... 
headquarters officers there as a liaison officer

04:47.193 --> 05:16.643
he didn't have any command function at all he was 
not he didn't interfere with the command at all but

04:47.193 --> 05:16.643
we fanned out and that gave them a responsibility 
and gave them a feeling well I'm being used like I

04:47.193 --> 05:16.643
ought to be used so it was a great morale builder and 
it was and they've continued this program that's

04:47.193 --> 05:16.643
right it's uh I think once or twice since then 
they've pulled the brigade back pretty much

05:17.028 --> 05:30.040
together for some specific reason, but I think the 
concept is still very much like we started it. Do

05:30.060 --> 05:35.485
you know if any other reserve units in the country 
started this kind after you began this? Did

05:35.666 --> 05:38.909
anybody else pick up? Well, I was told by Fourth 
Army people that they were going to instill it in

05:47.015 --> 05:55.527
They subsequently made it Fifth Army, and they had 
the unit up in Chicago under them then. And I'm told

05:56.468 --> 05:59.532
that they liked the idea well. Now, whether they 
ever instituted it or not to the degree that we did,

05:59.572 --> 06:04.359
I'm not sure. But they were certainly totally 100% 
sold on the concept. We saved many hundreds of

06:11.969 --> 06:16.515
thousands of dollars because we had the man hours 
to spend on something, and the class one

06:17.474 --> 06:32.239
installation engineers had some monies to buy 
things with, but we made his money go a long way when

06:17.474 --> 06:32.239
we furnished the personnel to do it with. Sure, 
sure. So it, that was one of the greatest

06:33.982 --> 06:40.393
accomplishments that I was able to help direct. 
And when we sat down with them and talked about it,

06:43.038 --> 06:46.583
they almost threw us out of the office. Never 
worked. Now, tell me about your other experience.

06:54.234 --> 07:10.498
Well, the one single thing that gave me a great deal 
of satisfaction was to institute a program of

06:54.234 --> 07:10.498
airlifting a construction company to summer 
camp, along with their equipment.

07:11.761 --> 07:15.444
They've carried troops to summer camp by air for 
years. That's no feat. But I could envision

07:18.487 --> 07:32.680
needing a construction company in Puerto Rico or 
Virgin Islands or somewhere that we have a

07:18.487 --> 07:32.680
responsibility and need to get them there. 
They've never gotten on an airplane with

07:33.861 --> 07:38.706
equipment or never loaded equipment or whatever. 
So I propose to Fourth Army that we do such a thing

07:41.714 --> 07:45.658
for something. What year was that? Do you 
remember?

07:50.644 --> 07:51.725
I don't know. We did it both the last two years. 
Let's see, 70 and 71. That's probably right, 70 and

07:56.770 --> 07:58.892
71.

08:01.595 --> 08:02.396
I think that's right. So you reposed it about 1969. 
That's correct. In fact, it may have been 68. I

08:07.642 --> 08:11.586
worked on it for a couple of years. But I proposed we 
do it, and they, again, sort of laughed at it. And it

08:16.069 --> 08:21.998
was a different group than I sold the program 
before to. They'd all gone. But they went forward

08:24.321 --> 08:31.812
with the request and came back with a routine 
refusal. So then I asked them to try it again, and it

08:31.832 --> 08:38.923
got a few headquarters further, but it was turned 
down because it said it The equipment was not

08:39.781 --> 08:42.704
available, and the funds were not available.

08:46.028 --> 08:55.738
In one of our diversified work programs, we had 
built an 18-hole golf course for Kelly Air Force

08:46.028 --> 08:55.738
Base. And one of the reserve Air Force commanders 
there was one of the ones involved in our lesson

08:55.758 --> 09:05.088
with Kelly Air Force Base. And we built a great 
facility there. The basics. We didn't do the

09:09.975 --> 09:21.026
refinements like the grass and some of the things 
that only the golf pros can do. But we built the

09:21.046 --> 09:29.273
bridges and the roads and the rough work on the golf 
course and laid the irrigation system, built the

09:21.046 --> 09:29.273
pro shop. We did this over a four-year period. So we 
had done a great deal of work for them, just a whole

09:32.797 --> 09:36.180
lot of work. And they would give me nearly anything 
I asked for. I got a jet airplane to go to Virginia

09:39.780 --> 09:48.274
one time just because they thought I needed it. But 
anyhow, I had gotten well acquainted with this

09:50.337 --> 09:56.588
wing commander down there at reserve. And he had 
subsequently been assigned as the chief Air Force

09:58.010 --> 10:02.978
reserve in Washington. So I had the thought, well, 
I might be able to appeal to him to help me on this

10:04.898 --> 10:10.428
program. So I saw the Chief of Army Reserve, who I 
knew very well, who was a Texan, General Sutton.

10:19.405 --> 10:20.747
Told him what I was going to do. Asked him if he had 
any objection, and he said he had none. Said, just

10:25.640 --> 10:30.805
give me a copy of your letters that you write to the 
Air Force, because it's cross-service. So I wrote

10:32.307 --> 10:37.873
to my friend in Washington, the Chief Air Force 
Reserve, and told him... What was his name? Still

10:40.496 --> 10:43.960
haven't thought of it. I'll get it. I'll get it in a 
minute. And he's an Aggie. Oh, that's right. So I

10:51.085 --> 11:00.899
wrote him a letter, and very shortly, like 10 days, 
I got a response back through...

11:03.122 --> 11:04.083
He's dead. Oh, that's right. I got a response back 
through Robbins Air Force Base in Georgia, which

11:07.888 --> 11:19.084
is reserve headquarters for some Air Force area, 
probably this whole part of the United States,

11:07.888 --> 11:19.084
can't you? They didn't say that he had written to 
him or anything. They just wrote me a letter as

11:22.878 --> 11:32.087
420th Commander and said they understood I had a 
flying mission that I would like to accomplish for

11:22.878 --> 11:32.087
summer camp. And the two questions were, where do 
you want to go and what do you want to haul? So from

11:37.932 --> 11:41.035
there, it was accomplished. We hauled a million 
pounds of men and equipment to Albuquerque, to

11:41.495 --> 11:48.902
Sandia Base. landed at Kirtland Air Force Base, 
and we departed from two places, from Corpus

11:49.540 --> 12:06.661
Christi Naval Air Station and from Bergstrom in 
Austin, divided the company, part of them were

11:49.540 --> 12:06.661
there and part of them here, and part of the 
equipment, and flew them to summer camp. We let

12:06.681 --> 12:17.254
them work for two weeks, and incidentally, the day 
they got there, they unloaded their equipment and

12:06.681 --> 12:17.254
they were working 1,000 miles away. My goodness. 
So it proved the point that I was after is that we

12:18.818 --> 12:27.109
could get in an airplane and go somewhere real 
quick, be working the same day. How many men were in

12:27.549 --> 12:30.233
on this? It was just a company size, 200 or less, 
just regular engineer construction company. But

12:39.505 --> 12:45.433
we'd put, I remember one particular load was a 
motor grader and 10 men. They just got in the

12:46.072 --> 12:49.895
airplane right with the motor grader. When the 
airplane landed, they cranked up the motor grader

12:49.915 --> 12:59.744
and drove it out of there, and they were out working 
in 20 minutes. So we had, oh, I've forgotten how

13:00.345 --> 13:14.998
many C-124s, but like 10 or 12 that went from both 
Naval Air Station Now, they made one or two trips

13:15.502 --> 13:18.145
each. They didn't fly it all at one pop. But anyhow, 
it worked great. We sent the company there. At the

13:25.394 --> 13:28.238
end of two weeks, we flew personnel home. We flew 
another company of people out there, and they took

13:29.559 --> 13:35.366
the equipment that was there and worked it for two 
weeks. Then they unloaded it and brought it home.

13:38.891 --> 13:43.416
So we really got training for two companies in a 
four-week period. We got very good remarks out of

13:44.678 --> 13:51.446
that operation. So the next year, Army provided 
for us to get in on this deal. They provided the

13:59.896 --> 14:07.885
opportunity for us to go to Florida to the 
conference where they allocate airplanes for

13:59.896 --> 14:07.885
this type of thing. We had our man down there that 
told them what we needed to haul and where and all

14:07.905 --> 14:13.892
this. They got in on that the next year and got us 
down there. So we did it two years in a row. The

14:20.596 --> 14:22.658
second year... And where did you go the second 
year? Same place. Okay. Because of the fact that we

14:24.360 --> 14:30.267
had this big, nice air base there that we could 
land. And then Sandia Base is right adjacent to it

14:31.028 --> 14:35.313
where we can work. So it is an ideal situation. The 
next year, then, they gave us the C-141, the

14:38.277 --> 14:43.423
Starlifter jet plane. And we went from the Naval 
Air Station in Dallas and Bergstrom in Austin that

14:44.197 --> 14:50.426
year. So we really coordinated with three 
different takeoff points, Army, Navy, and Air

14:51.427 --> 14:59.559
Force. And it sounds like more recently now the 
American government is considering mobile Army

14:59.579 --> 15:07.470
units and And they're talking especially with the 
problems in Iran and the problems in Afghanistan,

15:08.058 --> 15:15.907
how we need this type of mobility in our service. 
And it sounds like your idea was sort of a

15:15.947 --> 15:19.471
predecessor to that. I read that. Now, you know, 
World War II had some mobile engineer equipment

15:20.812 --> 15:30.743
that they could fly, but it was miniature stuff. 
Mm-hmm. It was little stuff built for that

15:31.514 --> 15:35.058
purpose. But my idea was taking conventional 
equipment, bulldozers, motor graders,

15:35.859 --> 15:49.517
trailers, rollers, water tanks, this type of 
thing,

15:35.859 --> 15:49.517
and go with it. Of course, we'd have to take a blade 
off a dozer because it had a lot of weight and width

15:50.037 --> 15:54.743
and all this. But it was a great mission in loading 
it and tying it down Our people got right in on that.

16:03.756 --> 16:06.740
And they were, I think they enjoyed it too. Is this 
type of mission still being performed? I don't

16:10.123 --> 16:10.984
believe it is. And I'm sure due to curtailment of 
funds and various things. And I really don't

16:18.112 --> 16:23.317
believe that they did it the year after I retired. I 
think they did it, we only did it the two years, I

16:23.337 --> 16:27.762
believe. I'm not absolutely certain, but I'm 
certain they're not doing it anymore. Of course,

16:35.196 --> 16:39.461
they're not doing a lot of things that funds make 
available. Oh, sure. Absolutely. Now that we've

16:41.944 --> 16:49.011
talked about some of your accomplishments when 
you were commanding, let's talk about

16:41.944 --> 16:49.011
shortcomings. Were there some shortcomings? 
Were there some things that you wanted to

16:50.313 --> 16:56.279
accomplish but just couldn't? Oh, there's got to 
always be... person that hangs his wagon to a star

16:59.399 --> 17:08.734
is not ever going to accomplish all the things he 
wants to.

17:09.395 --> 17:15.105
I'm not real sure that I can enumerate 
specifically things that I would have liked to

17:09.395 --> 17:15.105
accomplish. I'm

17:16.246 --> 17:23.098
sure that our level of training could have been 
better. We could have because I had more people

17:25.657 --> 17:34.431
trained in certain ways. But to specifically 
enumerate, I'm not sure. I was fortunate in

17:38.517 --> 17:46.470
commanding during the years that we had waiting 
lists for people wanting to get in. There was one or

17:48.854 --> 17:52.980
two years that we had a little problem with 
strengths, uh, nothing like they've suffered

17:53.990 --> 17:57.394
since then. So, you know, strengths weren't 
really a problem. Turnover was always a problem. I

18:03.863 --> 18:14.657
mean, uh, you'd always got new people that 
somebody was getting out, and, but, uh, and I had

18:03.863 --> 18:14.657
some fine officers, had some fine 
non-commissioned officers. Uh, I was in that

18:15.938 --> 18:21.145
unit, uh, twenty years, I believe, twenty, Yeah, 
20 years, 51 to 71. And it was a rewarding time as far

18:27.943 --> 18:35.912
as accomplishments

18:27.943 --> 18:35.912
and frustrations were few. We had them, but I can't 
really look back and say there were a lot of things

18:36.152 --> 18:45.703
that we ought to have done that we didn't. I know 
nobody's as efficient as they'd like to be, but it

18:46.343 --> 18:52.330
really went off well. My superiors were kind to me 
and just these things that I've talked about and

18:52.934 --> 19:00.786
working with us. Once they found out that we 
weren't just blowing our horn, we could

19:01.807 --> 19:12.142
accomplish something, they gave us the wooden 
water and we spent it. Okay. Well, let's end our

19:14.806 --> 19:21.576
conversation for this afternoon and have one more 
chat Friday or so. Okay. All right.

19:34.328 --> 19:35.654
This is a test. This is Terry Anderson. Today is 
August 1st, 1980. This is the third and last

19:39.632 --> 19:42.385
interview with General Hanover. This is a test.
