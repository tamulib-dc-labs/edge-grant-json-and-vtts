WEBVTT

00:01.938 --> 00:10.851
Rick Reynolds came up and put his hand over my 
shoulder and said, well, he'd been crying, but he

00:01.938 --> 00:10.851
said, now you've got something to tell your older 
brother about. You made it. And you feel a relief

00:12.053 --> 00:17.260
and a true elation because now you realize you're 
an upperclassman. And, of course, when you get

00:18.222 --> 00:23.630
back the fall of your sophomore year, you realize 
you're not much of an upperclassman. But a lot of

00:23.870 --> 00:26.614
elation. And so you go home. How, at the end of that 
freshman year? Near as I remember. My mother came

00:35.977 --> 00:37.219
and picked me up. I don't recall much about the trip 
home. I'd torn my knee, my ACL and medial meniscus

00:40.946 --> 00:51.604
in the fall playing intramural football, and so I 
went home for knee surgery. and was operated. Then

00:53.266 --> 00:58.176
I spent, after I recovered, went on to work the 
second half of summer up in Colorado. And so things

00:59.418 --> 01:05.810
were a little foggy back then, but I just get my knee 
repaired and go on. Having had the knee injury, I

01:07.573 --> 01:09.998
ended up through my freshman and the rest of my 
sophomore year, doing special weight training

01:11.480 --> 01:21.235
for my legs with Emil Mammoliga was over, and a 
wonderful guy, neat guy, and I really got a lot out

01:11.480 --> 01:21.235
of that. Met some wonderful people there in the 
athletic department, and they were very, very

01:21.936 --> 01:27.885
nice to me. Someone, I guess he took me in, he had a 
class of jocks in some sort of kinesiology or

01:27.865 --> 01:43.565
something and was explaining knee injuries and so 
had me stand up on a desk and demonstrate what had

01:27.865 --> 01:43.565
happened and what the procedure was that fixed my 
knee and that sort of thing. Did you become

01:44.346 --> 01:47.130
acquainted with the quack shack during those 
days? I did. Got the flu one time, felt bad

01:48.571 --> 01:57.703
somewhere during that year and went and realized 
that the guys that were in there were a lot sicker

01:48.571 --> 01:57.703
than me and I didn't want to stay. and hobbled over 
there the day after I'd torn my knee up, and it was

01:58.072 --> 02:05.519
swollen, and that's about where we were at that 
time. It was a quack shack, and it was not a whole lot

02:05.599 --> 02:08.782
to be done. Do you remember who the docs were? Don't 
remember. Where was the surgery done? The surgery

02:13.966 --> 02:15.047
was done in Midland. In Midland, okay. Yeah, it was 
done with Dad being a general surgeon. One of his

02:18.010 --> 02:20.712
colleagues, Dr. Thurston Dean, repaired my knee. 
As you get here as a sophomore, what was it like in

02:21.673 --> 02:27.218
your outfit to be a a sophomore? Well, we were 
pretty fired up and we were ready to go. We had a lot

02:32.442 --> 02:47.244
of freshmen coming in and you're full of piss and 
vinegar and you're ready to be an upperclassman

02:32.442 --> 02:47.244
and it didn't take too long when the orders started 
coming down and you didn't perform to realize that

02:32.442 --> 02:47.244
you were still a freshman in many ways. We had our, 
oh I guess what are you, squad leaders, I guess. I

02:52.955 --> 02:53.836
was a squad leader. There were many of my buddies. 
And you start working your freshman. But this was a

02:57.781 --> 03:01.726
wonderful time, because you start meeting new 
people. They're in your outfit. And you're the

03:03.528 --> 03:05.671
enemy, because you're the upperclassmen. And you 
can't fraternize with them in your own outfit. But

03:09.035 --> 03:12.860
I had a few of kindred spirit that shared some of the 
hunting and fishing things. And it wasn't long,

03:12.940 --> 03:15.863
and you learn to close the door. OK, guys, let's 
talk. And one of them was Mike Streetman, who owns

03:17.766 --> 03:21.370
Garcia's Cafe here now. Mike Bell, who's a pilot 
for Southwest Airlines, we've run into each

03:21.788 --> 03:26.595
other. Back when we were in the Air Force, we'd run 
into each other. Yeah, it was an upper class, but it

03:30.401 --> 03:32.524
was a little bit different as a sophomore. It's not 
near as meaningful as your freshman year, there's

03:33.265 --> 03:35.949
no way. You can't have near the memories, and you 
have a lot more pressure. And academically, you

03:40.636 --> 03:44.121
never thought about changing majors? I never did. 
Vet school was my focus because we felt that, both

03:45.262 --> 03:51.171
my parents and myself, a degree in veterinary 
medicine would give me the broadest base to do

03:51.573 --> 03:56.238
something in the natural sciences. I wasn't fixed 
on being a private clinical practitioner, but vet

03:56.899 --> 04:02.045
school was my goal. And that was my big goal during 
my sophomore year, and I almost didn't make it. I

04:08.112 --> 04:15.921
went core happy, and I got really hit up with being 
an upperclassman and being a sharp cadet, and

04:08.112 --> 04:15.921
grades suffered for the first time. Yeah, they 
went down. So I did better as a freshman than I did as

04:17.582 --> 04:19.825
a sophomore. And I posted a, I think it was like a 3.1 
or a 3.2 the fall semester of my sophomore year. And

04:31.118 --> 04:32.640
so that got my attention. And I'd run into my first 
difficult, truly hard class, and that was organic

04:32.680 --> 04:38.307
chemistry. For me, it was difficult. I didn't 
enjoy it. I hated the labs. And I was telling Kyle

04:42.832 --> 04:47.618
earlier, we walked by the chemistry building. I 
was in an organic chemistry lab. One of the

04:49.858 --> 04:56.505
upperclassmen in my outfit, a junior, was in that 
class, had not done well. He had been trying to get

04:56.566 --> 05:13.605
into, had a professional degree plan but was not 
doing well and had done something, not really

04:56.566 --> 05:13.605
wrong, but to irk his Chinese lab instructor. And 
the Chinese lab instructor said he was going to

05:14.193 --> 05:16.918
fail him. And he said, I've done everything right. 
And he said, no, you know, and he was duty bound. He

05:23.649 --> 05:30.801
was going to give him an F. And this upperclassman, 
and I can't remember his name, but I can remember it

05:23.649 --> 05:30.801
like it was yesterday, grabbed that lab 
instructor and held him out of the four-story

05:31.304 --> 05:38.495
window in the chemistry department, told him he 
was either, you pass me or I drop you. And Kyle asked

05:39.216 --> 05:49.012
me, I don't remember what came of that, but I know 
the upperclassman didn't get kicked out of

05:39.216 --> 05:49.012
school, so I guess he survived that deal, but he 
literally held him out of the window. Today

05:49.272 --> 05:50.414
there'd be a lawsuit. Oh, sure, sure, sure. He'd be 
dead. Now, did you go to vet school after two years?

05:58.446 --> 05:59.488
After two years. You were gung-ho for the Corps 
your second year, did your extracurricular life

06:10.488 --> 06:15.656
change that second year in terms of dates and 
social life and everything? No, my girlfriend, we

06:15.876 --> 06:18.280
broke up that fall. She was at Baylor, and that was 
the end of that. We still didn't have any wheels, so

06:21.424 --> 06:24.248
some things didn't really change. Sophomore 
wasn't really a whole lot different being a

06:24.288 --> 06:36.867
freshman, and had dates with other girls would 
come down from different places, and they start

06:24.288 --> 06:36.867
realizing there's a whole new world out there, and 
a number of wonderful young ladies from Houston,

06:37.673 --> 06:42.739
Dallas, wherever, but no real change there. Where 
did you and your buddies go on a Saturday night to

06:42.939 --> 06:46.383
have a good time? Well, sophomores were still 
underage. There wasn't really, I remember back

06:49.686 --> 06:56.794
then there was probably four barbecue joints and 
about four or five beer joints, and that was it, and

06:49.686 --> 06:56.794
we were underage. And I was a year younger than 
them, so, boy, there wasn't much. Did you all go to

07:00.939 --> 07:03.021
the clay pits? Well, I can remember... Of course, 
Whiskey Bridge, I remember going to the river.

07:09.413 --> 07:10.535
This is one thing we didn't talk about. Back at the 
start as a freshman, every year we'd have an outfit

07:10.555 --> 07:15.381
beer bust on the Brazos River. The upperclassmen 
would buy beer for the freshmen, and, of course,

07:16.102 --> 07:26.997
you piled into cars and went out there, and you had 
basically a fire, and everybody sat around

07:16.102 --> 07:26.997
drinking beer because there wasn't anything else 
to do. Typically, two or three of the freshmen

07:28.018 --> 07:33.786
would get so drunk they'd throw up in one of the 
upperclassmen's cars, and that was part of it.

07:34.188 --> 08:02.777
usually cold so they would have to worry about 
anybody well one year we had people swim the river

07:34.188 --> 08:02.777
back and back and forth and didn't lose anybody um 
did that every year and uh and there was beer and

07:34.188 --> 08:02.777
whiskey what were people smoking then there's no 
marijuana in our deal did you even know the word did

07:34.188 --> 08:02.777
because it it existed i hadn't been around it in 
high school uh just missed it i guess and There had

08:03.500 --> 08:09.406
been somebody caught with marijuana a year or two 
before I got into squadron six. One guy had had

08:09.666 --> 08:14.751
some, but it just wasn't that, it wasn't 
commonplace. It existed, you heard about it, you

08:15.631 --> 08:23.138
heard about some of the non-regs, some of the 
civilian students, but it wasn't an issue. You

08:23.158 --> 08:26.281
gotta remember, I was in a pre-vet, primarily ag 
outfit. These were country boys. And hadn't heard

08:28.744 --> 08:30.365
of heroin? No, no, hard drugs, narcotics were not 
an issue. And there really wasn't a wild place

08:33.858 --> 08:37.163
around here. Not anywhere close to here. There was 
the Lakeway Club, and the guys that got mobile,

08:40.509 --> 08:50.145
they might go out there up in North Bryan, a country 
western place. But that's pretty well it, because

08:50.946 --> 08:57.216
drinking laws and whatnot, there was no public 
place to go.

08:58.698 --> 09:02.865
Did you go to any religious activities? Was a 
Christian, am a Christian, was a Christian at the

09:04.868 --> 09:11.578
time, but didn't have any major push to go 
anywhere. There was a little Episcopal chapel

09:11.619 --> 09:16.406
just south of the core area, and that was within 
walking distance. And I'd gone to an Episcopal day

09:16.747 --> 09:18.850
school No, seventh and eighth grade, I think. And 
so I would go sporadically and enjoyed a pretty

09:20.566 --> 09:26.476
neat little congregation, neat little 
fellowship. But I wasn't a regular attender by any

09:26.696 --> 09:29.461
means. Was Bill Oxley the minute? Yes, he was. Bill 
Oxley, that's exactly right. He's now deceased,

09:32.666 --> 09:43.524
but I saw his wife last Sunday night at one of my 
faculty colleagues, Vic Treat's grandson was

09:32.666 --> 09:43.524
baptized and Mary was there. All right. Reverend 
Oxley, I can remember, I wasn't even

09:45.053 --> 09:49.039
Episcopalian, but he always had a twinkle in his 
eye. He was a neat guy, neat fella. Let's see, you

09:53.626 --> 09:56.831
applied for vet school your sophomore year? 
Sophomore year. Describe all of that routine.

10:00.397 --> 10:01.559
Well, it's sweaty palms time. You go through, you 
fill out the stuff, you make your application, was

10:01.619 --> 10:11.194
granted an interview, so go over in uniform like 
everything else. When I go into my interview Mad

10:12.796 --> 10:34.264
Dog Davis was there Dr. John Miliff neuroanatomy 
professor

10:12.796 --> 10:34.264
let's see Ken Davis

10:12.796 --> 10:34.264
clinical pathologist was there and maybe one 
other and when I walked in the room Dr. Miliff said

10:12.796 --> 10:34.264
where'd you learn how to shine your shoes and they 
had a good spit shine and I said, that's kind of what

10:34.750 --> 10:37.813
we do. So they want to talk about the Corps and these 
were old guard fellows and they were fine. And I'm

10:43.499 --> 10:45.121
thinking this is looking pretty good. And then 
they asked me about one of my letters of

10:45.181 --> 10:49.586
recommendation of which you've written me one, 
you probably don't remember. They didn't ask

10:49.626 --> 10:57.855
about that, but they got one from Dad Orson, 
Midland, Texas, one of their classmates. whom

10:58.072 --> 11:09.048
they had thought had been killed when the Japanese 
troop transport was torpedoed in World War II, had

10:58.072 --> 11:09.048
no idea that Dr. Orson was still alive. He didn't 
practice. He was a rancher in Midland. And until

11:11.792 --> 11:13.735
they got that letter, they had no idea. So that was 
neat, and they really wanted to know all about him.

11:16.179 --> 11:18.382
And so I'm really happy about this. I am great. I'm 
in. I can't lose. And then... Dr. Davis throws out

11:23.958 --> 11:29.004
my organic chemistry F that I had at midterm. He 
says, what about this? I said, oh, that was at

11:31.967 --> 11:35.711
midterm. We're already up to a C and we're looking 
good. But he said, by God, it better be. Well, I

11:42.198 --> 11:45.042
ended up getting accepted. And then my final 
grades came out and I had a D in organic chemistry.

11:50.519 --> 11:52.642
Because once I was accepted, I could care less. And 
with a letter from Al Price, the dean at the time of

11:53.323 --> 11:59.754
the vet school, that although it is passing, we 
strongly recommend that you retake it. And I read

12:00.455 --> 12:03.440
into it, strongly recommend, didn't say require. 
So I was off to Colorado the next day for two and a

12:03.840 --> 12:09.249
half months working in the mountains. But until I 
was accepted, you sweat bullets because a number

12:10.210 --> 12:16.140
of people, of course, applied to get into vet 
school. Had over 900 applicants that year. And the

12:18.768 --> 12:27.979
weekend that my letter came, got my mail over at the 
MSC, had my little mailbox, and you'd go by and

12:18.768 --> 12:27.979
you'd look daily, and there'd be nothing in it, and 
maybe a letter from home, maybe nothing. That was

12:28.440 --> 12:30.402
before the days of junk mail and credit cards. And 
there's a letter in from the vet school that says

12:31.403 --> 12:36.990
congratulations, and boy, I was just on cloud 
nine. Had two of my buddies that were sitting

12:37.050 --> 12:44.579
restrictions that weekend for some sin they'd 
committed, and they found out, and they jumped up

12:37.050 --> 12:44.579
and down. They were so excited. We took off. The 
rest of the guys were down. There was a group that

12:48.788 --> 12:55.595
went down to Hudgens Ramen Breeders down around 
Hungerford in the Horton area. Some of them had

12:56.696 --> 12:57.958
dates down there. And we found them at a dance hall 
that night somewhere in that part of the world. The

13:03.964 --> 13:05.245
guys were sitting restrictions. I guess, I don't 
know how many restrictions they had to sit after

13:05.325 --> 13:09.129
that, because they just bugged out and went with 
them. And we had somebody that got a case of beer,

13:09.149 --> 13:14.695
and we celebrated all the way down and back. You 
said about 900 applicants. How many were

13:18.437 --> 13:19.258
admitted? 125. Okay. And so

13:20.220 --> 13:30.996
you must have had a number of friends who were 
admitted and a number who were not here on campus.

13:31.016 --> 13:32.138
Out of the core, yeah, I did. A number on the campus, 
quite a high percentage that were pre-vet, that

13:32.458 --> 13:38.147
were in the Honors Colloquium, I think were 
accepted. Of course, a lot of vet students come

13:39.168 --> 13:43.635
from other schools. In my outfit, three of us were 
accepted. Two, Allen McClung, who's now

13:45.778 --> 13:53.549
deceased, and Jeff Lord, who practices in San 
Antonio, both got out of the Corps. I elected to

13:53.850 --> 13:54.831
stay in. Randy Doran over in B-1 was accepted and 
stayed in. And one, I believe it was one other guy in

14:00.659 --> 14:06.788
the Corps that got out of the Corps that accepted. 
The rest of them I'd known that were civilian

14:06.808 --> 14:08.931
students. How did you let your family know that 
good news? Oh, I gave them a call, and I remember my

14:13.418 --> 14:21.127
dad's pretty quiet and mild-mannered, and I said, 
Dad, I got accepted to vet school, and he said,

14:13.418 --> 14:21.127
well, that's real nice. I'll never forget, you 
know, that's, you know, Grandpa, he's about as

14:21.167 --> 14:25.292
excited as he gets. That's real nice. Good, I'm 
proud of you. That's about it, you know, but they

14:28.796 --> 14:30.278
were... They were pleased. Did any upperclassmen 
who was in vet school give you any advice then or

14:31.381 --> 14:40.737
before you got the next fall? No, I didn't really 
know any. I guess I knew one guy that was actually in

14:42.560 --> 14:50.052
vet school at the time, and he thought it would be a 
good idea that I get out of the Corps. And I didn't do

14:51.213 --> 14:52.335
that. And I'm glad I didn't, because I didn't need 
to. Other than that, I didn't know anything about

14:58.287 --> 15:00.810
vet school until I got there. All right. So you go 
home for the summer, come back in the fall. Right.

15:07.800 --> 15:11.084
And vet school began at about the same time as... 
Right. About the same time I got back in time to

15:11.504 --> 15:18.073
start my core activities, and I think I had an extra 
day or two. I'd bought a car that summer. I needed to

15:20.396 --> 15:22.919
have a car to get out to the vet school, so I bought my 
first car. I used Mach 1 Mustang. And... started

15:28.207 --> 15:30.750
going out and going to classes. Describe how you 
and the other members of that first-year class,

15:31.691 --> 15:38.017
how were you welcomed? Was there an opening event? 
There was of some kind. They had a thing early in the

15:43.322 --> 15:52.792
fall, just a welcome to the freshman class

15:43.322 --> 15:52.792
in one of the big amphitheaters. They had some 
little finger food, I think. That was about it. now

15:55.105 --> 16:18.987
i've heard that al price used to give a lecture 
about how to pronounce the word how to pronounce

15:55.105 --> 16:18.987
and spell veterinarian and i can remember we 
called him slick al but he he got up and he said v e t e r

15:55.105 --> 16:18.987
i n a r i a n you will learn to pronounce it properly 
and you will learn to spell it before you leave this

16:19.102 --> 16:23.788
class or you will fail vet school. It is not 
negotiable. I'll never forget that. And to this

16:26.812 --> 16:39.169
day, I meet people, I sit on this national council 
on education for veterinary school and

16:26.812 --> 16:39.169
accreditation, and I'm the number of people that 
can't pronounce veterinary. At Missouri. And I

16:42.920 --> 16:44.922
was very close to the vet school up there. Because, 
see, I was the chairman of the search committee

16:45.563 --> 16:50.328
that brought George Shelton here from there. 
Right. And then, unknown to me, when I was about to

16:51.509 --> 17:03.801
be interviewed up there, they put the president of 
the Alumni Association, University of Missouri,

16:51.509 --> 17:03.801
on the search committee. Not a bad idea. He saw that 
I had an A&M connection. So he called up the fellow

17:09.845 --> 17:22.668
that he called Uncle George because his dad, as a 
vet faculty member, had office next to George

17:09.845 --> 17:22.668
Shelton for 21 years. And said, tell me about this 
guy, da, da, da. And then see Richard Adams. was on

17:30.415 --> 17:37.684
the faculty and dean, and then he became dean up 
there while I was still up there, so a lot of... Now,

17:30.415 --> 17:37.684
what were you doing in Missouri? I was a chancellor 
up there. You were chancellor, okay. Either you

17:39.587 --> 17:42.370
were president or... Well, the terminology is 
reversed up there. Chancellor runs the campus.

17:43.532 --> 17:47.897
Okay, because you left and you were president at 
UTEP and chancellor at Missouri, okay. Because I

17:47.918 --> 17:54.146
visited with Richard Adams when he was still at 
Missouri when we were doing our accreditation

17:47.918 --> 17:54.146
stuff a good bit. And see, when I got there, the vet 
school was on probation. Right, a facilities

17:56.769 --> 17:58.211
issue. Yeah. And I got the fellow that sat on my left 
for 15 years that had a fair amount of money from the

17:58.411 --> 18:06.803
beer business in St. Louis. And he made a big gift 
that helped a great deal. That's what I heard. I'm

18:11.930 --> 18:15.856
to do the commencement speech at the vet school 
this spring. Wonderful. And when we dedicated the

18:16.817 --> 18:24.368
Clivesdale Hall, as they happened to name it, the 
senior young lady and speaking for the students.

18:27.363 --> 18:43.116
She said, and in summary, Mr. Bush, what I want to 
assure you is that on behalf of all of the graduates

18:27.363 --> 18:43.116
of this vet school from now and in the future, I 
promise you we will do everything in our power to

18:27.363 --> 18:43.116
see that your profit is very good from 
Anheuser-Busch. Drink that Budweiser. So did you

18:50.687 --> 18:57.056
turn to anybody before that fall semester, any 
practicing veterinarian or anything? I had never

18:57.076 --> 19:00.541
worked for a veterinarian, hardly knew one. And I 
went to Colorado. Worked horses and fly fished and

19:04.274 --> 19:06.556
did my deal. Nope. And I'd been around medicine, of 
course, all my life with my dad's practice, but

19:07.237 --> 19:11.060
didn't. I was ready to go. And again, I didn't have a 
clinical, this is what I've got to do type thing.

19:16.085 --> 19:19.167
Instead, I knew that I had a plan right after 
school. Again, the war's still going on. I took an

19:21.189 --> 19:22.150
early commission. When I would graduate from 
professional school, I would go on active duty as a

19:23.691 --> 19:26.934
captain. So I knew that I'd be going into the Air 
Force for a couple years minimum right out of vet

19:26.954 --> 19:33.420
school. And as it turns out, I got an Air Force 
health profession scholarship greatly aided by

19:33.957 --> 19:43.468
my participation in the Corps that paid out vet 
school. I was getting $400 a month back then just to

19:43.508 --> 19:47.532
go to vet school. So when I left here, I owed no 
money. I was in great shape. You just introduced us

19:51.637 --> 20:00.927
to the first year program in vet, the first 
semester in veterinary medicine. What kind of

20:00.907 --> 20:02.770
courses? Basic courses, basic medicine courses 
and anatomy. Everybody remembers freshman

20:08.600 --> 20:10.663
anatomy. We also had a biochemistry course taught 
over here on the main campus. The anatomy It's all

20:18.895 --> 20:20.878
memorization. It's rote memorization back then, 
but it had to be done. I remember one of our

20:24.123 --> 20:36.702
colleagues that was real pushy-grabby, and he 
would come to a table of bones, and if you had one in

20:24.123 --> 20:36.702
your hand, he'd grab it out of your hand. You know, 
because he wanted it. You know, he was going to

20:38.116 --> 20:38.877
learn. His name was Mike Norton. And Mike grabbed 
the wrong bone from the wrong guy one time and got

20:42.282 --> 20:49.452
laid out right over an anatomy table, right there 
in the vet school. That put an end to the grabbies.

20:51.896 --> 20:53.738
Vet school was pretty, it was a new experience. I 
was still in the Corps, but I would spend my days

20:53.778 --> 20:59.807
with mostly, all of them older students. I was the 
youngest in the class, but all older, many of whom

20:59.867 --> 21:07.077
at least close to half had come from other 
institutions. that many of them knew nothing

21:07.681 --> 21:09.644
about A&M. One of my closest friends was, we still 
had 10 contract students from Louisiana, Paul

21:10.766 --> 21:25.888
Drake, big old coon ass from Ponchatoula, and he 
would just call me C.T., Corturd. And with his coon

21:26.128 --> 21:29.233
ass he'd say, hey C.T., but we got along fine. They 
all laughed, and every once in a while I'd have my

21:29.602 --> 21:34.148
uniform on, and they'd really get a kick out of 
that. But it was all in good fun. And two of us, Randy

21:37.152 --> 21:50.389
Dorn over in B1 and myself in Squadron 6, two of us 
stayed in the Corps, and we would march to chow in

21:37.152 --> 21:50.389
our white scrub suits because we had to get on to vet 
school in the mornings and get back in time for

21:37.152 --> 21:50.389
formation. And it worked okay. So you lived in the 
Corps area, went to morning chow, Then quickly

21:58.137 --> 21:59.759
hurried over. Went to the vet school, got in the 
car. Vet school all day. Right. And there was a

22:03.784 --> 22:10.933
snack bar, and we'd eat over there and snack on 
something over there, and then come home in the

22:03.784 --> 22:10.933
evening for evening formation. And it worked 
pretty well, and it wasn't too bad. Compare the

22:13.716 --> 22:23.048
rigor of the courses first year in vet school 
compared to what you'd had freshman and sophomore

22:13.716 --> 22:23.048
year, undergraduate. In some, they're a lot more 
focused, obviously, but, and I would say they were

22:25.002 --> 22:35.235
not any more rigorous than my honors colloquia. 
They really were not. They were just more focused

22:36.517 --> 22:38.359
towards where I was heading. And I had, and I was 
taking a heavier load. And you were there all day

22:43.826 --> 22:45.448
long. All day long, right. Did you sometimes go 
back at night? Sure. And of course,

22:49.708 --> 22:51.912
transportation was a big thing. But now I had 
wheels, so going for evening formation and then if

22:51.952 --> 23:05.472
we had something on at the school at night or I 
needed to be in the vet school library, I would go

22:51.952 --> 23:05.472
back over if I needed to. as a senior then as a, well 
as a second year student then, when I was a senior in

23:06.211 --> 23:16.351
the Corps, they were starting to get into clinical 
rotations and things I needed to be there for. But

23:16.612 --> 23:19.157
it was okay, it worked alright, it was doable. 
Looking back on it now, were there some important

23:19.323 --> 23:27.457
teachers, courses that first year in vet school? 
Everybody has favorite professors and things. I

23:31.043 --> 23:38.716
liked, Mike Tatum taught histology and 
understood the core and was very encouraging. You

23:38.937 --> 23:43.204
know, stay, go do, how is it, fine.

23:44.888 --> 23:50.987
I think the majority of the professors, I remember 
Dr. Miliff, I disrespected him because he was old

23:44.888 --> 23:50.987
and he'd been there. And that was neat. I don't 
think, what other? Some were team-taught, so I

23:58.810 --> 24:01.617
don't recall. But for some reason, Mike Tatum 
sticks out as being just very much a pleasant

24:01.757 --> 24:07.171
gentleman. And Dr. Jim Anderson, physiology, 
pharmacology, I don't know if it was first year,

24:07.191 --> 24:15.030
but he and... Dr. Clark and others were just, and 
Dr. Gleiber were real class people. I didn't take a

24:22.830 --> 24:30.183
like their courses, but they were so pleasant, 
such true gentleman scholars, true scientists.

24:30.263 --> 24:31.365
They were cut above the average. They were neat 
people. And the dropout or flunkout rate in vet

24:32.425 --> 24:36.532
school was quite low. Very low. I think we lost a 
couple students, probably three or four, and then

24:38.555 --> 24:44.746
they were replaced early on. Were there women in 
your classes? We had six. How were they treated?

24:50.976 --> 24:53.861
With some respect, but not a whole lot. They were If 
there were one or two that were, they got along

24:56.185 --> 25:03.334
pretty well and they were okay, and there were one 
or two that had a chip on their shoulder and they

24:56.185 --> 25:03.334
caught hell every day. It never let up. And I 
presume they had not been A&M undergraduates. I

25:11.365 --> 25:15.010
know two of them had as married students. The 
others came from outside, near as I remember. I'm

25:18.294 --> 25:23.341
pretty sure, it was only six, and I think four of 
them came from outside, two of them had been

25:18.294 --> 25:23.341
undergraduate but were married. Were there any 
black students? No, there wasn't one in any of the

25:25.092 --> 25:28.137
classes while I was there. But it was not 
officially segregated. No, no, there just

25:33.665 --> 25:34.647
weren't. There were only four blacks in my class in 
the corps total. There were no blacks on the A&M

25:38.893 --> 25:43.500
football team until Hume McElroy came to play when 
I was a junior. All right, let's jump back on that.

25:46.064 --> 25:51.032
As far as you were aware, those four blacks in the 
corps, how were they treated? Treated well. I

25:53.624 --> 26:00.814
don't, there was no, again, it was pretty, you 
know, colloquial part of the world to a point, but I

25:53.624 --> 26:00.814
don't think there was any problems. The two that 
had the roughest go were Fish Taylor and Fish

26:01.575 --> 26:15.834
Webster that were in Spider D. Their problems 
stemmed not because they were black, but because

26:01.575 --> 26:15.834
of Spider D and the horrible attrition rate. And to 
this day, I can remember, because Fish Taylor had

26:16.435 --> 26:21.542
such a loud voice, other upperclassmen picking on 
him all over the campus and I can remember being in

26:22.349 --> 26:35.650
the academic building in history and hearing 
somebody talking or listening to Fish Taylor

26:22.349 --> 26:35.650
answer to somebody and then Humpett because he was 
in Spider D and I and of course they both flunked out

26:36.254 --> 27:00.439
but so did and that was the end of Spider D that was 
the last year at least in at that point in time in

26:36.254 --> 27:00.439
history they were disbanded after that year and 
went into C1 and C2 and were scattered around but

26:36.254 --> 27:00.439
now the the black students there were that stayed 
on I think by the time we were seniors I believe

26:36.254 --> 27:00.439
there were four and graduated, all of them have 
done well. All of them got four-year degrees and

27:03.038 --> 27:04.824
did fine. Like typists, this is not, don't need to 
add this in, but I've told people here that blacks

27:05.325 --> 27:15.154
had a much easier time being the pioneers here than 
the first women did. There's no question. It was

27:19.454 --> 27:21.938
way harder for women than it was for blacks. Oh, 
there's no question. None whatsoever. And Fred

27:24.682 --> 27:29.710
McClure is a superb example of that. So you were an 
unusual person in being in the core and being in vet

27:35.266 --> 27:46.951
school at the same time, and were there any times 
that you recall that first year particularly when

27:35.266 --> 27:46.951
you had to make a choice of which do you do? Yeah, I 
guess I was in Ross Volunteers and we had rifle

27:46.991 --> 27:55.890
drill every evening. And there were times that I 
had, there was three nights a week that was

27:56.512 --> 28:01.758
difficult for me to get back in time for rifle 
drill. And so I had to get into my fatigues and get

28:02.378 --> 28:08.905
out to rifle drill, and because I was late, I always 
had to run extra. And there was not a thing I could do

28:09.246 --> 28:15.132
about it unless I cut my vet school class short, and 
I couldn't do that, so I just did the running. And

28:15.773 --> 28:21.579
I'd had my knee surgery, and so my knee was a 
constant pain and problem, and so I hobbled

28:15.773 --> 28:21.579
through the RVs, but it was worth it. It was fun. And 
you were selected as an RV at the end of your

28:22.941 --> 28:26.164
sophomore year? or at the beginning of the junior, 
whenever that happens. I haven't recorded this

28:30.254 --> 28:33.058
before. How does one become an RV? Do you apply? I 
think you must apply, or either that or you're

28:36.784 --> 28:41.010
asked to apply. I don't recall. I think you're 
asked, I don't know, I believe you're asked to

28:42.032 --> 28:47.680
apply. Did you turn in letters of recommendation 
or anything? I don't recall any letters of

28:50.721 --> 28:52.305
recommendation. I think you stand on, there's a 
selection committee, I assume, and I really, I

28:52.325 --> 28:58.243
don't remember,

29:00.029 --> 29:29.884
it's basically you know if you want to do this go you 
know you're you're up you know would you be

29:00.029 --> 29:29.884
interested type deal and and then go on and stand on 
the merits of whatever you've done your first two

29:00.029 --> 29:29.884
years who the selection committee was no was it 
other cadets it would have been it would have been

29:00.029 --> 29:29.884
uh rv uh rvs from the year before and how many are 
selected we had three platoons of uh

29:00.029 --> 29:29.884
approximately 20 per platoon i want to say 
approximately 60. So about half of them were

29:30.117 --> 29:31.700
juniors? No, those were all juniors, and then you 
had a handful of, you had two, four, six, you

29:32.541 --> 29:45.023
probably had about 12 senior advisors, and that 
was it. Or you had your platoon leaders and the

29:45.204 --> 29:49.211
first sergeant, and that was it. So you had 10 or 12 
seniors, and that was it. But only two were active

29:51.785 --> 29:57.433
with each company with the drill, with each 
platoon drill in the afternoon. So really only six

29:57.493 --> 30:01.158
after seniors that were there on a day-to-day 
basis. How did you learn you'd been selected?

30:05.825 --> 30:06.325
Don't recall.

30:10.612 --> 30:11.172
I don't remember. I was the only one. Let's see. I 
guess I was the only one in our outfit.

30:22.666 --> 30:26.630
There was one other, Kort Koontz, no two, Kenny 
Hill, Kort Koontz, and myself. Kort had come over

30:26.670 --> 30:30.374
from squadron eight because there were no ag kids 
in it. So the three of us were selected. And I

30:33.256 --> 30:38.902
remember they had a little banquet at the MSC where 
they handed us our yellow crapper cords. And that

30:39.282 --> 30:43.507
was the last fun time we had as juniors. Well, 
that's not true, but that was back before drill

30:44.207 --> 30:47.931
started. And you were in the RVs two years. Just one 
year as a junior, and only you could go out to drill

30:53.807 --> 31:03.182
as a senior if you wanted to, but only a few that had 
the time that could stay on. What were the

31:03.202 --> 31:06.708
highlights of being an RV member that year? Oh, two 
things. One was the governor's inauguration. It

31:08.892 --> 31:12.518
was Preston Smith, and the main thing was going to 
Austin. being an RV there, and we were in the, I

31:12.498 --> 31:26.440
guess we were in Senate chambers, or the House, we 
were in a smaller room, it wasn't full chambers,

31:12.498 --> 31:26.440
but the microphone was on, and we didn't realize 
it, and we were getting dressed, and we were

31:12.498 --> 31:26.440
cutting up in there, and it was being broadcast all 
over the Capitol. Did anybody attempt any

31:28.323 --> 31:32.370
goof-ups or jokes? Oh yeah, we had, and I can't 
remember,
