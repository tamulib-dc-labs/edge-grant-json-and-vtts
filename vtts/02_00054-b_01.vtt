WEBVTT

00:02.393 --> 00:03.154
do with that?

00:03.414 --> 00:05.436
You were going to work for whom doing what?

00:06.617 --> 00:11.102
Well, I knew I was going into the service for one thing, of course, and they know whether that would be a career or not.

00:11.182 --> 00:21.573
But the aspect of counseling and hiring was appealing to me, helping people get promotions, doing positive things.

00:22.954 --> 00:29.481
Little did I realize at the time that that field really involved so much with paperwork and

00:30.271 --> 00:34.575
and you don't have that personal touch like I thought it would, but that was my thoughts.

00:34.635 --> 00:37.218
That's what I was hoping to be able to do.

00:37.318 --> 00:43.965
As you're working your way through academically, did you learn about any gift courses that were just giveaways?

00:44.345 --> 00:47.268
They were always trying to get some extra grade points.

00:47.328 --> 00:55.536
There were always people telling you about courses that were supposed to be a C&J or an easy grade or something of that nature.

00:55.853 --> 01:02.964
that we'd hear about, and most of us would try them, and we wouldn't necessarily always make an A, you know, but there was always rumors of that.

01:02.984 --> 01:09.193
As far as you and your buddies knew, were there any giveaway courses for athletes or for rich boys?

01:10.576 --> 01:11.517
We weren't aware of it.

01:11.657 --> 01:12.999
I'll tell you now, we were close.

01:13.821 --> 01:23.295
Well, I wouldn't say that my freshman year we weren't close to athletes, but later on we had a lot of classes with them, and I never knew of that, never even thought about that at that time again.

01:23.562 --> 01:25.605
It was just because of my immaturity.

01:26.006 --> 01:27.408
I don't think they existed then.

01:27.428 --> 01:27.969
I don't think so.

01:27.989 --> 01:28.730
I really don't.

01:28.950 --> 01:29.811
I really don't.

01:31.153 --> 01:37.563
Were there any... The athletes were more like real students than possibly today, I would say that.

01:37.703 --> 01:46.296
A lot of them went through the Corps also, not to the degree that the regular Corps, but they wore uniforms at times.

01:47.120 --> 01:52.846
So as that freshman year is working out, you're beginning to feel good about it and everything.

01:53.887 --> 01:54.107
Yes, sir.

01:54.768 --> 02:00.374
As you get ready to end that freshman year, how did you feel when you went through final review as a fish?

02:01.235 --> 02:04.098
Well, of course, a great feeling of accomplishment.

02:04.378 --> 02:16.030
And just, again, myself just being, I guess you would say, a sensitive person, it was a sad time for me to see those seniors.

02:16.617 --> 02:27.530
They had played such a great part of my life and my maturing as a person and a cadet and thinking that I would never see them again.

02:27.590 --> 02:31.394
And like most freshmen, the seniors, they're really the stuff.

02:31.414 --> 02:33.296
And there'll never be another class like that.

02:33.376 --> 02:36.760
And certainly not the sophomores when they become seniors.

02:36.780 --> 02:38.322
They'll never be that good.

02:38.707 --> 02:42.052
So it was a double-edged sword for me.

02:42.072 --> 02:49.904
It was a time of rejoicing for my classmates and I to have accomplished what we did and to get through the hard times.

02:49.984 --> 02:50.906
I mean, they were hard.

02:52.148 --> 03:01.021
But at the same time, to think that we'd never see some of these people again that had spent a lot of time with us and coaching us to become men.

03:01.522 --> 03:04.647
Now you go back to the dorm and change your outfit

03:05.757 --> 03:11.303
Yes, change your uniform to the upcoming year and then go right back, right back.

03:11.403 --> 03:17.710
It wasn't much delay like there is now between the first pass and the last pass.

03:18.591 --> 03:22.995
It was like we can, we always had the drills out on Simpson drill field.

03:23.596 --> 03:25.038
And it was covered just about.

03:25.138 --> 03:28.041
It was just about full of cadets, one end or the other.

03:28.121 --> 03:32.946
And a great time to see all those seniors lined up.

03:33.415 --> 03:43.709
stretch one end to the other, and many of them with tears in their eyes, and coming out to salute you and their way of congratulating you for making it and carrying on.

03:43.769 --> 03:46.373
It was a tough time.

03:46.553 --> 03:49.537
Do you remember going to commencement, that freshman year?

03:51.040 --> 03:51.620
I do not.

03:52.241 --> 03:53.102
I sure don't.

03:53.122 --> 03:55.225
All right, you go home.

03:55.305 --> 03:56.227
What did you do that summer?

03:57.328 --> 04:01.334
The first summer I went home, I worked at Lone Star Army Ammunition Plant.

04:01.774 --> 04:02.916
I taught swimming.

04:03.233 --> 04:23.357
most of my high school years, but that summer, I worked at Lone Star Army Ammunition Plant, roofing buildings, putting tar, taking off roofs, little flat buildings, and they were the size of an acre, at least, in size of an army installation, and re-roofing it with hot tar.

04:23.838 --> 04:31.587
It was already 100 degrees, and that hot tar, it was probably 150, so I know I wanted some cowboy boots real bad,

04:32.377 --> 04:41.930
But every time I'd go to the store and price them, I would say, now, is that worth two weeks of work up on that hot roof, you know?

04:42.371 --> 04:47.158
Made you appreciate money a little bit more than possibly before.

04:47.618 --> 04:53.507
Your first year or two down here, about how much money did you have as spending?

04:53.527 --> 04:54.408
Oh, I don't remember.

04:54.448 --> 04:56.190
I mean, I don't remember having any.

04:56.210 --> 04:56.871
I didn't work.

04:56.992 --> 04:58.594
Nobody in the court really worked.

04:58.614 --> 05:00.597
Something, I would say, that I knew of.

05:00.737 --> 05:02.299
I mean, it seemed like they were always there.

05:03.106 --> 05:09.613
But some of the guys maybe worked in Duncan and did that type of work.

05:10.354 --> 05:13.758
So as far as money, there wasn't anything to do for one thing.

05:13.818 --> 05:21.047
There wasn't but one or two eating establishments in the whole area that we were aware of.

05:22.989 --> 05:24.711
So mom and dad paid your way.

05:25.331 --> 05:26.032
They did now.

05:26.052 --> 05:26.893
Like I say, I worked.

05:26.913 --> 05:29.316
But for the most part, they did.

05:29.498 --> 05:36.888
All right, did you then that, after that fish year, did you save some of that summer money and spending money?

05:36.908 --> 05:37.449
Oh, yes, sir.

05:37.469 --> 05:37.809
Yes, sir, we did.

05:38.290 --> 05:40.893
And help, you know, put it on the schooling too.

05:40.913 --> 05:49.545
But I'm going to have to say that my parents were, they really sacrificed in order to enable me to have the experience of college.

05:49.565 --> 05:53.029
What was different about being a sophomore at A&M?

05:53.049 --> 05:59.438
Describe all of a sudden, you know, you're one in authority and you're kind of the instructor and swapping places.

05:59.857 --> 06:04.383
I wasn't one of the few.

06:04.644 --> 06:07.848
I'm not saying right or wrong.

06:07.908 --> 06:12.635
I'm just saying that, again, because of my Christian background, I didn't cuss.

06:12.715 --> 06:21.027
And so I was able to coach and teach in a way that was different.

06:21.047 --> 06:26.995
In fact, I've had some of my underclassmen tell me that the one thing they remember that I was tough and made them a man.

06:27.413 --> 06:30.784
but they never heard me cuss.

06:31.286 --> 06:34.335
Did you use a paddle ever in a clothes hanger?

06:34.877 --> 06:36.202
I never used a clothes hanger.

06:36.222 --> 06:39.432
I never had a paddle of my own that I used in

06:40.171 --> 06:49.620
I probably, the broom was about the only thing that I ever used on a few and never probably hit as hard as I was hit.

06:50.702 --> 06:58.189
But there were a few and it was mostly and never in a situation where they weren't expecting it or kind of.

06:58.209 --> 07:02.293
What about, were there, do you remember any pranks played on you as a sophomore?

07:04.175 --> 07:10.161
Yes, not as many as what I pulled when I was a fish.

07:10.647 --> 07:11.508
Babo bombing.

07:11.528 --> 07:15.194
I never did babo bombing, but a lot of cadets did.

07:17.137 --> 07:17.898
Drowned outs.

07:17.958 --> 07:35.524
We would, when an upperclassman had given us a hard time, some sophomore coming in from class, this is back to the fish year, we would fill up big trash cans full of water and when they would come in at the end, we would dump it on them and as they were coming in at the end of the dorm and run off, of course.

07:36.162 --> 08:02.288
if you want me to tell you another story as a fish maybe, and it's in here if you need to, in my book, but one of the things was when, you had to have every button on your uniform, you couldn't have cables on, everything had to be just perfect, lined up exactly right, the brass had to be in a certain spot, and they'd inspect you every formation, and one formation,

08:02.622 --> 08:32.275
one of the sophomores was inspecting me, and lo and behold, I had one of my buttons that was unbuttoned, and so he told me to come by his hole, which is his room, after chow, and went by his room, and he gave me this real long lecture about what a sloppy cadet I was, and he said, make you remember this, I'm gonna cut your button off, so you'll have to sew it back on, and you'll remember next time not to leave your button unbuttoned, so he got to looking around for a knife, and he didn't have one,

08:32.896 --> 08:40.806
So he asked me, and I was just standing up against the wall at the detention, and he was shooting me up one side and down the other, and he asked me if I had a knife, and I said, no, sir.

08:41.506 --> 08:44.170
I wasn't about to give him my own knife to cut off my own button, you know.

08:44.210 --> 08:50.237
So he said, you wait right here, and I'm gonna go next door and get a knife, and I'll be right back.

08:50.337 --> 09:02.852
So while he was gone, I took my knife out, went in his closet, cut off five buttons off his shirt, stuffed them in my pocket, went back over and stood his attention, and he comes back in with his knife and cuts it off,

09:03.693 --> 09:06.378
hands it to me and said, well, that's just the way it goes, fish cocks.

09:06.819 --> 09:08.602
And I said, yes, sir, that's the way it goes, sir.

09:09.584 --> 09:24.132
And left, and of course, he didn't try that shirt off for a few days, so I don't guess he ever knew who it was that cut those buttons off, but that's one of the pranks that most people seem to appreciate the most.

09:26.845 --> 09:34.752
And as a sophomore, your guidelines, let's see, you say you didn't cuss them.

09:36.074 --> 09:41.559
What about, what were your, what bugged you most?

09:41.599 --> 09:43.681
What bothered you most that you were trying to?

09:43.821 --> 09:55.452
I think just anybody that had a sold attitude or more so than their uniform or their room appearance, which was, I still checked on that and didn't like that either, but

09:55.803 --> 10:07.956
But if anybody had some kind of attitude or didn't really love the traditions or fussed about anything, you know, had any kind of reaction like that, that was kind of my pet peeve.

10:07.976 --> 10:08.216
All right.

10:08.236 --> 10:11.600
Now, by that second year, are you attending church locally?

10:13.182 --> 10:13.782
I would say no.

10:13.922 --> 10:16.846
No, I wasn't very good.

10:18.367 --> 10:20.950
What did you and your buddies do on Sunday morning?

10:22.043 --> 10:33.694
Well, like I said, when I go, my sophomore year, we're talking about most of my sophomore year, and I was signing in every hour on the hour because of the previous year.

10:34.815 --> 10:40.920
But I sleep in a lot, go to there, visit each other's homes.

10:41.761 --> 10:48.207
By our sophomore year, we were starting to visit each other more and go home with people that were a lot closer than I was.

10:48.387 --> 10:51.510
A few times they got to go home with me, but it's a pretty long trip

10:51.777 --> 10:53.921
make on a weekend up to northeast Texas.

10:53.961 --> 11:04.420
So the people from around Gonzales and Van Vlick and Houston and that area is mostly where we would go just to get away or stay here.

11:04.500 --> 11:06.804
And of course if there was a ball game or something like that.

11:06.924 --> 11:08.747
Had you discovered the MSC by then?

11:10.070 --> 11:11.372
Yes.

11:12.398 --> 11:19.487
But it was almost a chore to go to because you had to wear a uniform and you couldn't go in without it.

11:19.507 --> 11:22.350
You couldn't even go get your mail without having a uniform on.

11:23.031 --> 11:30.420
So as far as going to the MSC and being a relaxing place, for me in particular, probably not so much.

11:30.801 --> 11:32.002
I wish that it had been.

11:32.022 --> 11:37.229
It was just my fear of the upperclassmen or whatever.

11:37.789 --> 11:42.355
If you needed to just relax during the day to get away

11:43.685 --> 11:51.316
Where could you go and kind of... There weren't a lot of places that I was aware of, so there wasn't a lot of relaxing on me.

11:51.356 --> 11:56.363
It seemed like we were doing something all the time, getting ready for intramurals, if not the core stuff.

11:58.206 --> 12:11.886
But a few times, very few times, maybe not more than two or three for me, Dick Hickerson, who was from Bryan College Station, played baseball for the Aggies, older than me,

12:12.052 --> 12:27.051
who was a roommate of Randy Wortham that I mentioned earlier, lived right off campus, and a couple times we'd go over to Miss Hickerson's house and just hang out over there for, but I would say that didn't happen more than a couple of times.

12:28.152 --> 12:32.878
And Randy Wortham was here for his master's, and he and his wife had a place off campus,

12:33.297 --> 12:38.604
And sometimes I would go over there and just hang out at their place, and they were real nice about that.

12:39.925 --> 12:41.708
Randy and Linda Wortham.

12:41.928 --> 12:43.390
All right.

12:44.411 --> 12:46.894
Let's see, Guyon Hall was still... Oh, yes.

12:47.034 --> 12:47.795
Yeah, in the movies.

12:47.815 --> 12:49.117
What a great fun time.

12:49.137 --> 12:49.518
Describe.

12:49.698 --> 12:53.883
A real tragedy in my eyes, of course.

12:53.983 --> 12:58.949
I'm real big on tradition and not tearing down all the old stuff.

12:59.070 --> 13:00.992
I tell you, and we're bad about that,

13:01.192 --> 13:23.332
in America, and even at Aggieland, we would think that we'd be one of the last ones to tear down old stuff, but Yon Hall was a beautiful structure with the columns, and it's where they would, we'd have a lot of our corps meetings, and they'd have POWs that would come and talk to us, but it was also a place where they showed flicks, movies.

13:23.412 --> 13:23.852
Flicks.

13:24.072 --> 13:29.357
And how did you and other Aggies... Oh my goodness, it was hilarious.

13:29.377 --> 13:30.338
Now I wasn't much,

13:30.554 --> 13:38.585
about making comments and cutting up and coming up with cute sayings with different scenes.

13:38.665 --> 13:40.949
I was more shy and held back.

13:41.049 --> 13:49.741
But I mean, there were some guys that were hilarious and they were much more funny than the movies with the comments they would make it a love scene.

13:49.801 --> 13:57.171
In fact, it was one of my dad's favorite places to go when he came to campus and would visit with us and to go to Guyne.

13:57.251 --> 13:58.653
He thought that was tremendous.

13:58.693 --> 13:59.835
He had never seen anything.

14:00.288 --> 14:09.098
like that and that was one of his great memories and therefore one of mine and it was a tragedy when they tore it down to me.

14:09.979 --> 14:22.032
One of my friends, Mr. Hoffman, who was class of 1939, was a POW and Japanese prisoner of war camp for three and a half years.

14:22.452 --> 14:27.898
His son was here when they tore it down and he was able to get one of the chandeliers

14:28.283 --> 14:29.245
out of Guyne.

14:29.986 --> 14:36.437
And just a few years ago when we got to know them, we came close with them.

14:36.477 --> 14:41.747
He gave it to me to give to the Corps Center, so I took it over and gave it to them.

14:42.488 --> 14:44.612
So that's, it was a great place.

14:44.652 --> 14:49.380
The Guyne family learned of the destruction

14:50.322 --> 14:52.790
by seeing a picture in the Waco paper.

14:52.911 --> 14:54.276
No, no.

14:55.279 --> 14:59.674
Dorsey McCrory, Mr. Rutter's assistant, forgot to call him.

15:01.409 --> 15:06.134
So obviously when they made a major gift about three years later, it didn't go to A&M.

15:06.334 --> 15:07.675
Yes, I imagine.

15:07.695 --> 15:09.917
No, we should have at least saved the facade.

15:10.058 --> 15:11.919
Yes, oh, exactly.

15:12.200 --> 15:14.462
And it would have faced right down Military Walk.

15:14.602 --> 15:16.504
Wouldn't it not have been beautiful?

15:16.664 --> 15:20.428
I agree with you totally, and I don't know why we do that.

15:21.168 --> 15:23.731
Let's see, did you go to the movie much at Northgate?

15:24.392 --> 15:25.633
We did some, yes.

15:25.813 --> 15:29.897
I remember I'd be studying or something, and

15:30.130 --> 15:33.174
And one of my buddies would come in and say, let's go to the flick.

15:33.234 --> 15:35.397
Johnny Beckham would come in and say, let's go to the flick.

15:35.778 --> 15:36.379
Oh, I can't.

15:36.419 --> 15:37.160
I've got to study.

15:37.440 --> 15:38.501
Oh, come on, let's go.

15:38.521 --> 15:39.543
No, I can't.

15:40.724 --> 15:41.385
What's showing?

15:41.826 --> 15:42.727
Raquel Wells.

15:42.887 --> 15:45.050
Well, okay, I guess so.

15:45.070 --> 15:49.797
So we lost many a great point over at the movie theater at Northgate.

15:52.340 --> 15:55.024
Were you involved in anything at the YMCA?

15:56.168 --> 15:58.610
No, sir, not that much now.

15:59.251 --> 16:01.573
Fish came later on, but... What about the quack shack?

16:01.593 --> 16:02.874
Did you have any reason?

16:02.894 --> 16:03.114
Yes, I did.

16:03.134 --> 16:03.835
I had measles.

16:03.955 --> 16:07.058
I had the measles when I was down here as a fish.

16:07.739 --> 16:08.579
Oh, describe that.

16:08.679 --> 16:09.921
Oh, my goodness.

16:10.101 --> 16:13.364
It was terrible, and itching.

16:13.384 --> 16:23.453
They put me in a tub and filled it with ice cubes to stop some of the itching and the spread of it, but that was a horrible time.

16:23.773 --> 16:25.635
How long did... I want to say about

16:25.919 --> 16:31.486
Three days, and that's my memory of the crack shack.

16:31.506 --> 16:33.308
Do you remember any of the doctors by name?

16:33.328 --> 16:34.170
I do not.

16:34.610 --> 16:35.952
I'm sorry that I don't.

16:36.072 --> 16:51.592
One time I was looking through, as a pitcher, I was looking through a microscope in biology, and one of my buddies, or I thought he was, came up behind me and hit me in the back of the head and drove my eye down into the microscope, and so I had to wear a patch around for several days until I got over there.

16:51.612 --> 16:53.995
But I never went to any doctor except the crack shack.

16:54.015 --> 16:55.757
I didn't know any here in town.

16:56.311 --> 17:01.697
And let's see, and you said that you did not participate much then in religious activities.

17:02.798 --> 17:05.601
We were talking about athletics a while ago.

17:05.621 --> 17:09.946
I would say formalized religious activities as far as church.

17:10.366 --> 17:17.474
There was a Navigators program that was real active here, a great Bible study group that I was involved with to some degree.

17:17.494 --> 17:18.955
Where did it meet?

17:19.035 --> 17:19.736
Different places.

17:19.756 --> 17:20.597
It was more like a...

17:21.100 --> 17:43.463
small groups and they would help you in memorizing scripture and stuff and i didn't attend that like i should but that was a lot of that was going on campus crusades some of those things it was really different for any of them because in those days in the 60s the rest of the campuses in america were going wild yeah burning the flag and buildings and demonstrating it who were the campus

17:44.489 --> 17:45.450
personalities.

17:45.670 --> 17:46.651
When did you first?

17:46.711 --> 17:47.452
Pinky Downs.

17:48.973 --> 17:49.914
Make believe I didn't know.

17:49.934 --> 17:51.615
Who was Pinky Downs and what did he do?

17:52.136 --> 17:54.558
Well, Pinky was the official greeter.

17:54.578 --> 17:57.981
We considered him the official greeter at Texas A&M.

17:58.081 --> 18:01.083
He was a class of 06, I believe, if I'm not mistaken.

18:01.163 --> 18:12.833
And got to know Pinky more in detail when I was a junior year leader and a Haley leader in senior year because he was always at ball games and he was always giving us ties and stuff like that.

18:12.853 --> 18:13.534
And so...

18:13.733 --> 18:20.404
But even as a freshman and sophomore, you'd always see Pinky around the MSC, always pleasant.

18:20.424 --> 18:25.813
A lot of, you know, it's a shame, but there were some people that would kind of make fun of him.

18:26.354 --> 18:36.771
Pinky was real small and pretty old at that time, kind of feeble, like wore real thick glasses, you know, the Borney Five type in a way.

18:37.207 --> 18:42.255
But I always had a great respect for Pinky because his heart was with the Aggies.

18:42.295 --> 18:51.529
He had a great heart, loved A&M, loved the students, and to me, he was a good age.

18:51.750 --> 18:52.611
What about Earl Rudder?

18:52.691 --> 18:58.320
When did you... Earl Rudder, of course, he was here the entire, he was president of the college the entire time I was here.

18:58.580 --> 19:00.103
Do you remember your first impressions?

19:01.024 --> 19:05.391
Well, just a man, I didn't know a lot about his war history

19:05.945 --> 19:11.595
his decorations and what all he'd accomplished in World War II early on, my first year or two.

19:12.096 --> 19:20.551
I guess we were so wrapped up in the Corps and ourselves and trying to keep out of trouble, we weren't good at learning that about them at that time.

19:20.591 --> 19:30.248
But as far as really getting to know him in a personal way was when I was head jail leader and had several meetings with him one-on-one in his office.

19:30.886 --> 19:48.203
It was always an honor and that's when I started to realize what a great man he was and what a visionary and many of the things you mentioned earlier about the non-compulsory corps and the lying females to come, the name change, all that occurred here in my

19:48.706 --> 19:50.968
tenure here and talked to him about all of that.

19:51.008 --> 19:52.370
It was tough on him.

19:53.171 --> 19:56.054
I don't think we were on tape while ago when we were talking about this.

19:56.074 --> 19:56.655
We'll get to that.

19:56.835 --> 19:57.636
We'll get to that later.

19:58.457 --> 19:59.518
Commandant was whom?

19:59.638 --> 20:00.098
Do you remember?

20:00.339 --> 20:00.799
Davis.

20:02.080 --> 20:02.701
Colonel Davis.

20:04.003 --> 20:08.307
Describe him and personality as far as you recall.

20:08.327 --> 20:11.971
Very military looking and his bearing was very military.

20:12.011 --> 20:18.358
Even back in those days as far as the commandants always and the staff, the bulls we called them,

20:18.862 --> 20:29.896
A lot of them didn't necessarily have a lot of respect for, but some were, you know, very good and helpful and encouraging to us.

20:30.897 --> 20:35.383
And among the other celebrities on campus, Reveille.

20:36.765 --> 20:36.825
Ms.

20:36.885 --> 20:40.009
Reveille, ma'am, of course, and Rudder.

20:40.782 --> 20:50.732
I had a dog that we called Rudder, and we also, during my time, had another dog, Tripod, that had three legs, and we called Tripod.

20:50.792 --> 20:51.953
It was always around campus.

20:51.993 --> 21:09.810
They weren't official mascots, but they were very much a part of the Corps and the legend, and just... And then, as far as individuals,

21:10.550 --> 21:15.157
Corps people or... Any other celebrities, luminaries?

21:15.978 --> 21:29.279
Well, of course, later on, I don't know if you were just talking about my sophomore year or not, but later on Randy Madsen, of course, became world famous when he threw the shot put at 70 feet, the first person in the world to ever do that.

21:29.639 --> 21:36.810
And I was there for that in Kyle Field in March, I believe it was, of 65.

21:37.280 --> 21:40.924
with my buddies, and we saw that event, the Shot Heard Round the World.

21:41.945 --> 21:46.431
And a funny story to go along with that that I'll share with you if you want this.

21:47.852 --> 21:52.838
Just about a week later, that was the Shot Heard Round the World is the way the newspapers described it.

21:52.878 --> 21:56.742
And so everybody across the United States knew Randy Mattson.

21:56.803 --> 22:04.992
And a week later, Johnny Bickham, my buddy from Van Vliet, went home with me and went to church with me that Sunday.

22:05.495 --> 22:14.926
Outside of church, he was introducing himself as Randy Mattson to everyone and shaking hands and autographs and all this and all the little kids were just really eating it up.

22:15.286 --> 22:26.459
We were having a revival and we went down and sat on the very front row because we were late getting in there and they had extra chairs and we were not five feet from the podium there.

22:26.479 --> 22:31.384
We were right in front and after the service was over, the visiting evangelist

22:31.870 --> 22:55.571
came back and sat right in the chair facing us, just five feet away, and so Johnny had to fill out a business card during that time of announcements, and of course he put his real name on it, not knowing that they were gonna call his name out in the service, so here we are, and they called out Johnny Bickham, and here he is on the front row, just, oh, he's squirming bad.

22:55.871 --> 23:00.375
He finally stands up, you know, which now everybody knows he's not Randy Batson,

23:00.895 --> 23:07.284
And he's looking down and the visiting evangelist points at him, kind of points at him like this and says, I like your tie.

23:07.985 --> 23:09.988
Bickham thought he said, zip your fly.

23:10.488 --> 23:15.215
So Bickham's standing up in front of the whole congregation, looking down, fixing his zipper.

23:15.856 --> 23:18.179
And so we'll never forget that.

23:19.200 --> 23:24.988
And the sermon that day, part of it had to do with casting lots for Christ's garments on the cross.

23:25.629 --> 23:28.253
So gambling was in part of the sermon.

23:28.570 --> 23:35.683
And so after it was over, we were talking to the visiting evangelist, and he was saying, oh yeah, I used to be a pastor down in Austin.

23:35.723 --> 23:38.989
He said, but always pull for the Aggies.

23:39.750 --> 23:44.519
And Bickham said, well, old country style, he said, well, I'm glad you pulled for them.

23:45.100 --> 23:48.807
I just hope you didn't bet on them.

23:49.006 --> 23:54.451
And here the Sherman had been on gambling.

23:54.471 --> 23:59.837
When did you get attracted to being a Yale leader?

24:01.218 --> 24:05.002
Not until the end of my sophomore year when it came time to run.

24:05.062 --> 24:09.567
I'd been an athlete in high school and not ever been running anything but cheerleaders, of course.

24:10.568 --> 24:14.912
That's all I ever knew until I came to A&M and then of course I quickly realized that

24:15.382 --> 24:26.354
Yale leaders were completely different and probably the closest thing to being an athlete that you could be at A&M without being an athlete, but still being involved in all of that.

24:27.255 --> 24:30.479
So I was still a little bit backward and all.

24:30.499 --> 24:39.009
I'd been selected to be first sergeant of squadron two at the end of my sophomore year, and many of the upperclassmen encouraged me to run for Yale leader.

24:39.589 --> 24:44.815
I had kind of gained a little bit of recognition on the campus, just mainly because

24:45.655 --> 24:47.697
all the different pranks that I would pull.

24:47.878 --> 24:51.742
And when I say pranks, back then they weren't destructive.

24:52.323 --> 25:00.753
I would never, Aggies don't destroy, true Aggies don't destroy anything on this campus or hurt anyone permanently.

25:01.353 --> 25:08.822
So it was fun pranks and I just kind of had a reputation for that which I had gotten around and they thought I could win.

25:08.842 --> 25:10.764
Did somebody suggest it to you?

25:10.784 --> 25:11.866
Yes, oh yes.

25:12.186 --> 25:14.008
I would never have thought about it.

25:14.427 --> 25:21.958
several of my upperclassmen in my outfit and even in the dorm from other outfits.

25:22.118 --> 25:23.740
They knew that I loved A&M.

25:23.760 --> 25:27.185
They knew I was strong on the traditions and serious about them.

25:29.368 --> 25:32.433
Describe, if you can, how did that get organized?

25:32.473 --> 25:35.877
Well, back then it was so different than the day to day.

25:35.958 --> 25:36.679
It's pretty professional.

25:36.699 --> 25:38.521
They have signs and everything back then.

25:39.222 --> 25:43.388
I don't even remember having signs out.

25:43.553 --> 25:52.125
But did you go to... We would go around dorm to dorm, introduce ourselves, just say, hey, I'm running for Yale leader and appreciate your vote.

25:52.145 --> 25:53.347
That's basically what it was.

25:53.367 --> 26:04.482
We didn't make speeches to groups and it was almost a one-on-one type deal and they either knew you and knew that you were a true Aggie and loved the traditions and knew them or not.

26:04.502 --> 26:07.947
Back then, that was one of the biggest aspects I would say was the traditions.

26:07.967 --> 26:09.048
And there were how many?

26:09.068 --> 26:09.349
Six?

26:09.789 --> 26:11.071
There were five Yale leaders.

26:11.912 --> 26:12.413
There were...

26:12.848 --> 26:19.236
two junior Yale leaders, three seniors, one of them having to be a civilian.

26:19.256 --> 26:26.625
A lot of people don't realize that, but one of the Yale leaders during the period that we were there had to be from the civilian ranks.

26:26.645 --> 26:27.326
I didn't know that.

26:27.346 --> 26:35.316
So, we always had a civilian, anything about it now, it's... All right, and where did people vote then?

26:35.856 --> 26:40.442
I think at the MSC, it seems to me like, and somebody might tell you better about that,

26:40.658 --> 26:43.081
It wasn't all over campus, I don't believe.

26:43.121 --> 26:44.983
How did you learn the results of the election?

26:47.405 --> 26:50.488
It was before it came out in the bat.

26:53.852 --> 27:08.387
Some of my upperclassmen actually learned and came to my room and told us, and so some of my buddies would haze us anytime you got some kind of campus-wide position like that, especially the yell eater, they would tie you up in a,

27:08.924 --> 27:13.368
bedsheet and tie you to the tree and spray you down with water.

27:13.428 --> 27:17.292
They might cover you with shaving cream and shave you all over.

27:17.312 --> 27:17.833
Did they?

27:18.053 --> 27:18.754
Yes, they did.

27:18.794 --> 27:19.394
Yeah, they did.

27:19.494 --> 27:21.797
They did all that to me.

27:22.477 --> 27:22.878
To you?

27:23.058 --> 27:24.900
And what time of night did that happen?

27:25.340 --> 27:27.923
That was probably getting close to midnight.

27:28.123 --> 27:28.443
Okay.

27:29.264 --> 27:31.186
That's the time the results came in.

27:31.246 --> 27:33.488
And where did... I was in the dorm.

27:33.548 --> 27:35.530
No, but where did this shaving occur?

27:36.111 --> 27:37.412
Oh, there at the dorm.

27:37.780 --> 27:38.621
In the showers.

27:38.761 --> 27:39.622
Oh, oh, oh.

27:39.642 --> 27:40.603
It was indoors.

27:41.044 --> 27:42.045
Yes, it was indoors.

27:42.065 --> 27:46.491
Now, as far as tying you up in the sheet and hanging you from the tree, that was out in the quad.

27:46.991 --> 27:50.636
One of the trees from the quad, they'd just tie you up and throw water on you.

27:50.796 --> 27:55.402
All right, then was there any formal announcement the next day in the dining hall?

27:55.422 --> 27:56.783
No, I didn't remember anything like that.

27:56.804 --> 28:01.790
It wasn't a big deal, and it was just kind of a matter of fact.

28:01.810 --> 28:02.551
It was a job.

28:02.771 --> 28:04.513
How'd you let your parents know?

28:05.219 --> 28:09.243
Well, I called them and told them, and they didn't know much about it.

28:09.303 --> 28:24.075
They thought I was crazy for running and couldn't understand why their little athlete high school boy would be running for something like what they consider to be cheerleader, you know, not knowing anything about it.

28:24.095 --> 28:33.824
And more than 200 interviews don't have anything about this, so describe how does a Yale leader get prepared, trained, conditioned?

28:33.844 --> 28:35.125
Okay, once you're elected,

28:35.527 --> 28:42.694
As you know, the yells have been pretty much basically the same for several decades.

28:43.075 --> 28:51.583
And the formations, the hand signals have pretty much been the same.

28:53.225 --> 28:59.331
The previous Yale leaders, right after you're elected, they will get with you and you start working.

28:59.351 --> 29:04.656
And then during the summer, you will get together as often as possible, not too often,

29:05.075 --> 29:07.500
because we just weren't able to in those days.

29:07.540 --> 29:08.923
You weren't on campus during the summer.

29:08.963 --> 29:11.548
We didn't go to summer school very much back in that time.

29:11.628 --> 29:17.700
And so, just whatever time you could work in from the time you were elected to the end of the year and then

29:18.406 --> 29:25.216
The week or so before the first ball game, when you came back the next year, you were just mostly over in the Grove.

29:25.296 --> 29:26.659
It's where we'd practice a lot.

29:27.560 --> 29:32.988
And who was the head yell eater then?

29:33.749 --> 29:35.632
Mike Marlowe, class of 64.

29:35.893 --> 29:36.854
He was the head yell eater.

29:38.697 --> 29:44.025
My freshman year was Jim Davis, sophomore year, Bill Breshears and Mike Marlowe.

29:44.444 --> 29:52.491
As you look back in those years, was there any Corps outfit or Air Force or Army that dominated?

29:52.631 --> 29:54.032
No, not like today.

29:54.253 --> 29:57.936
That's kind of true today in a lot of ways, but back then it really wasn't.

29:58.576 --> 30:05.462
We had two areas, the new area, the Duncan area, but we had a lot of the Corps over in what they call the old area, the Sebesa area.

30:06.023 --> 30:12.949
So I lived always in the new area, and the only way I would meet most of the people over in the old area was

30:13.132 --> 30:14.874
in class with them or something like that.

30:15.175 --> 30:17.257
So it was almost two different groups there.

30:18.579 --> 30:20.401
But it wasn't that way at all.

30:20.481 --> 30:28.231
It was just kind of almost like they knew who really knew the traditions and loved them and meant something to them, it seemed like to me.

30:28.411 --> 30:28.631
All right.

30:28.691 --> 30:33.357
Then after your sophomore year, what did you do that summer?

30:33.377 --> 30:36.000
That summer I worked again at

30:36.402 --> 30:40.067
Lone Star Ammunition Plant, right out of Texarkana.

30:40.087 --> 30:41.909
Did basically the same thing.

30:41.929 --> 30:44.353
Come back still, majoring in?

30:44.513 --> 30:45.775
Personnel Management.

30:45.815 --> 30:46.015
All right.

30:46.315 --> 30:46.896
Yes.

30:47.277 --> 30:49.600
And you're still in the same outfit that fall.

30:49.620 --> 30:50.461
Still in that same outfit.

30:50.481 --> 30:53.945
First sergeant, first time to have a position like that.

30:54.006 --> 30:57.450
I've been president of my class in high school all four years, all that kind of stuff.

30:57.470 --> 31:03.338
But this is the first time to really have some type of leadership position where you were dealing with 120

31:03.875 --> 31:06.758
So you're a Yale Eater and a first sergeant.

31:06.778 --> 31:07.178
Yes.

31:07.198 --> 31:09.761
Where was your... And RV my junior year.

31:09.801 --> 31:14.005
So it was the time and my grades probably suffered for it.

31:14.146 --> 31:22.574
I wasn't the greatest student in the world, but hung in there to... How did you learn you might have a chance to be an RV?

You know, they just announced for you to apply.

31:28.821 --> 31:30.102
You apply and just...

31:30.470 --> 31:32.058
Do you have any idea who?

31:32.621 --> 31:32.842
No.

31:33.184 --> 31:35.214
Who told me?

31:36.018 --> 31:38.149
Or who selected you?

31:38.229 --> 31:38.792
I do not.
