WEBVTT

00:02.714 --> 00:12.668
design study on it, and we had a regular naval 
architect actually do the nitty-gritty, you

00:02.714 --> 00:12.668
know, drawing the lines and laying out the 
compartments. I think around here, if anybody has

00:14.911 --> 00:20.699
enough interest in it, they can get pretty much 
what they want. Again, we've got a hardcore group

00:23.063 --> 00:31.995
of seagoing people here, probably only half a 
dozen, out of a staff of about fifty that go to sea.

00:37.073 --> 00:51.631
And considering my experience both at Woods Hole 
and Scripps, I think we'd do a lot better as far as

00:37.073 --> 00:51.631
getting the kinds of things that we feel we need on 
the ship. Well, of course, when I was both of those

00:51.651 --> 00:59.721
places, I was in a hierarchy, of course, much lower 
down, right next to the bottom. and here I'm

01:00.123 --> 01:01.765
halfway up it. So I feel that I get just about 
everything I want as far as ship time goes, and I get

01:01.785 --> 01:11.176
all the ship time I need. Again, having been at sea 
many, many times, I'm a little bit conservative

01:13.739 --> 01:21.648
about how I design my programs. I always, 
depending on when you start the game and the ship

01:21.708 --> 01:28.476
time request thing, we jockey back and forth. and 
then you end up with X number of days. And then I

01:31.770 --> 01:40.580
always design a program to fit within it with some 
slop on either end, having had, you know,

01:31.770 --> 01:40.580
experiences with weather and things like this. 
And then what we always try to do is fill in the

01:41.861 --> 01:47.087
clinks with other people. Like this coming 
spring, we'll be going up north again, and there

01:49.650 --> 01:55.577
are two primary programs that are going to be 
serviced. And we can do that with probably

01:56.165 --> 02:02.573
somewhere between nine and eleven people, but we 
can carry eighteen. So what we'll do is, well,

02:02.814 --> 02:06.619
invite other people along. They might be 
students, they might be people from elsewhere,

02:07.800 --> 02:13.307
but we always fill the ship up. I think our 
programs, when they go to sea, both, well, in all

02:14.849 --> 02:24.762
the programs that we've been involved with at both 
Scripps, Woods Hole, and here, we've always had a

02:14.849 --> 02:24.762
full complement. We've always design programs 
where we can accommodate other people mainly

02:26.843 --> 02:55.146
because we get something from them and they get 
something from us but by and large we get pretty

02:26.843 --> 02:55.146
much the ship time that we ask for now it's almost as 
if it were deliberate now you know I'm as an

02:26.843 --> 02:55.146
historian I'm you know signing this from just what 
I've read so I may have misconstrued it feel free to

02:26.843 --> 02:55.146
tell me so but it's almost as if it were deliberate 
on the part of the University of Washington

02:26.843 --> 02:55.146
Washington not to participate in international 
expeditions of one sort or another. Is that

03:01.280 --> 03:04.144
correct, and is that a good choice to make? I guess 
our track record on that has been sort of spotty. At

03:10.433 --> 03:21.850
one point, because we had one of the major programs 
of IDOE here, but because of personality

03:10.433 --> 03:21.850
problems, I think more than anything else, they 
had a shootout at the O.K. Corral, and academia

03:25.366 --> 03:33.618
being the conservative

03:25.366 --> 03:33.618
sort of a—what word am I looking for? Anyway, it's 
sort of the nobility-type structure, and if

03:33.678 --> 03:39.287
you're not in the structure, you lose. And so the 
group got fed up, and they bailed out and sort of

03:39.827 --> 03:44.955
disintegrated. We do have people here who do 
participate in international programs, but

03:45.055 --> 03:53.668
we're not the lead organization. Again, that 
probably has something to do with our backwards

03:53.851 --> 04:05.623
outlook on life,

03:53.851 --> 04:05.623
and how do you get hired, how do you get promoted, 
how do you get pay raises? You know, you just put

04:05.963 --> 04:19.457
your body in, and if it always consists of 
multi-authored papers, then the poor guy's stuck

04:05.963 --> 04:19.457
with the comment that he can't do any original 
thinking. If he only has single-authored papers,

04:20.598 --> 04:23.841
well, then he can't get along with anybody. So 
again, with these larger multi-institutional or

04:24.327 --> 04:35.341
at least coordinated efforts, the product is 
almost invariably multi-othered papers. And for

04:35.742 --> 04:38.726
our junior members to get involved with that is 
suicide. And a lot of them have gotten involved

04:39.006 --> 04:42.591
with it, and they're no longer here. That's just 
the way it is. I think it's kind of wrong. I think the

04:49.099 --> 04:51.162
department chairman or whoever there's going to 
be a spokesman at the promotion or pay raise thing,

04:51.378 --> 04:58.264
should take the time to figure out what the guy has 
done. You know, you can't always tell on paper, but

04:58.304 --> 05:18.803
time and time again, we go down and we half-lease 
things out in our promotion thing, which I guess

04:58.304 --> 05:18.803
because of the way we do it, it turns out to be 
policy, or it can be interpreted to be that, but if

04:58.304 --> 05:18.803
the guy isn't doesn't look on the surface as if he is 
an individual scientist doing his own thing, he

05:20.690 --> 05:27.976
doesn't stand a chance in this department for 
promotion. So, you know, you have something like

05:29.017 --> 05:46.232
that operating for ten years, and this is 
approximately how long the present department

05:29.017 --> 05:46.232
chairman has been department chairman, he can do a 
very effective weeding job, and the end result we

05:29.017 --> 05:46.232
have has been a direct result of that kind of a 
policy. The junior members, the assistant

05:46.973 --> 05:50.376
professor level people who play the big 
cooperative kinds of ventures don't stand a

05:52.145 --> 05:58.012
chance of getting promoted. And so obviously 
anybody with any insight or any, or can just notice

05:58.453 --> 06:09.006
what's happening around him, if he wants to stay 
here, he better not play that game. So that's a big

06:10.308 --> 06:16.595
sort of historical thing, and I guess historical 
can span a decade. But the other thing that if you

06:17.416 --> 06:21.882
look at the hiring and firing record at this 
institution up until about the time I came here it

06:22.182 --> 06:50.265
looked like they were making it was a definite 
policy here to fire and not hire seagoing people

06:22.182 --> 06:50.265
that's you know that's what the record shows 
although they keep telling me that's not the case

06:22.182 --> 06:50.265
but that's that sure as heck is what the record 
shows just recently we it seems to me that in order

06:22.182 --> 06:50.265
to keep the ship running know if you want to 
maintain a facility like that you got to you got to

06:51.089 --> 07:19.915
be able to demonstrate utilization i think they 
they made a concerted effort to swing around the

06:51.089 --> 07:19.915
other way so that next year calendar year 78 is the 
first year in almost a decade where we actually had

06:51.089 --> 07:19.915
conflicts of trying to schedule the ship and part 
of it's due to one of these big programs probes

06:51.089 --> 07:19.915
which is something going on in the bering sea 
insisted they had to have the ship for 120 days in

07:20.975 --> 07:47.067
such a certain window and it couldn't stand much 
shifting and from a departmental point of view we

07:20.975 --> 07:47.067
had to accommodate these people because they're 
going to use that boat for the next three years so

07:20.975 --> 07:47.067
but this county year 78 we sure as heck had a problem 
and it turns out that our Bruce Frost program and

07:20.975 --> 07:47.067
myself We had to go down to Oregon State and use 
their boat, which is probably a good thing, again,

07:47.772 --> 07:57.063
for political reasons. We should be more 
cooperative with our neighbors than we have been

07:57.463 --> 08:00.667
in the past. There's been a change in people down 
there, and there's been a change in people up here,

08:02.449 --> 08:06.994
so maybe we can do that now.

08:09.878 --> 08:16.986
Now, if you were to list what are your major 
contributions to oceanography thus far, what

08:09.878 --> 08:16.986
would you list? What research are you the proudest 
of?

08:22.670 --> 08:34.545
Well, okay, I guess I like to think that all the 
stuff I've been doing for the last decade sort of

08:22.670 --> 08:34.545
goes into the food web dynamics. And I've taken one 
side of the phytoplankton research. And the data

08:39.331 --> 08:47.361
I've collected, that I've personally collected 
over the past decade, comes up with some viewpoint

08:48.185 --> 09:17.787
that is rather different than the accepted 
viewpoint and

08:48.185 --> 09:17.787
this has got me into all sorts of interesting 
discussions sometimes shouting arguments but

08:48.185 --> 09:17.787
this probably has been my major contribution is 
that that I've taken a rather different point of

08:48.185 --> 09:17.787
view than an awful lot of people have been taking I 
sort of goes back to my my so-called training. We

09:20.435 --> 09:31.628
didn't have really any oceanography, per se, at 
Cornell, so most of my

09:20.435 --> 09:31.628
experience, you might say, has come out of the 
textbook. And at that time, almost all the

09:31.908 --> 09:36.013
textbook examples came from the North Sea. And I 
went out to California. We started working in the

09:38.296 --> 09:41.259
blue waters out there, and nothing fit. It didn't 
fit anymore. And so I've come up with some rather

09:47.011 --> 10:15.668
strange notions in some people's mind about how 
phytoplankton in the ocean really work the big

09:47.011 --> 10:15.668
emphasis has been on physiological aspects and 
how can you relate physiology to ecology and i

09:47.011 --> 10:15.668
don't think that really holds in the ocean the 
laboratory work has been going on and we've been in

09:47.011 --> 10:15.668
the biological oceanography field we've spent an 
awful lot of money on physiological

09:47.011 --> 10:15.668
investigations of laboratory cultures, but I 
think by and large they're not really applicable

10:16.255 --> 10:21.763
to what goes on in the ocean. And there is a small 
group of us that have this point of view, and well

10:22.423 --> 10:42.611
obviously I think we're right, but I think we're 
going to change our attitude on how phytoplankton

10:22.423 --> 10:42.611
really work in the ocean in the next decade. The 
other thing which again, is sort of part of this

10:46.563 --> 10:54.730
overall food chain thing in the ocean is our work 
with sediment traps. And what we're doing is

10:55.090 --> 10:58.973
looking at the downward movement of organic 
matter. In a period of about 18 months, we've

11:00.855 --> 11:08.982
developed a sediment trap system here that's 
probably as good as anybody else's. And I like to

11:09.643 --> 11:16.148
sort of think that some of these people who've been 
playing with it for a decade have finally caught up

11:09.643 --> 11:16.148
with us. And I'm kind of proud of that. It's got me 
into an area of electronics that I never thought I

11:20.562 --> 11:29.236
was ever going to get involved with, having 
sometimes my doubts whether electricity really

11:20.562 --> 11:29.236
exists. But that's probably

11:29.937 --> 11:37.690
the two accomplishments. One of them is kind of a 
diffuse thing, which is sort of goes through a

11:42.166 --> 11:53.519
number of papers, and I have a chapter in a book that 
came out this past year where I finally stood up and

11:42.166 --> 11:53.519
said, this is what I think, and this is the reason 
why. And the phytoplankton are different than

11:53.559 --> 12:01.509
what we've been visualizing them all along. And 
the sediment trap work, which is, again, like I

12:02.670 --> 12:12.021
said earlier, it's one of the major unknowns in 
biological oceanography maybe in the overall

12:12.322 --> 12:41.620
scheme of things it really doesn't make much 
difference but it turned out to be a problem that

12:12.322 --> 12:41.620
was nice to work on at that time there was a couple 
people here who wanted to work on it and it was the

12:12.322 --> 12:41.620
right time right place you know right group of 
people and i think it really worked out quite

12:12.322 --> 12:41.620
nicely

12:12.322 --> 12:41.620
that was it speaking of electricity uh Now, is 
there anything you'd like to add to the tape? What

12:44.317 --> 12:45.258
would you like to tell me? Gee, I don't know. You 
want some biographical background? I'm going to

12:52.966 --> 12:56.610
get that after you say what you'd like to say. I want 
biographical background.

13:00.654 --> 13:10.864
Well, I guess one of the questions when we get the 
student-faculty get-togethers is, you know, you

13:00.654 --> 13:10.864
always have to sort of get up and repent and stuff 
like that. And I guess in retrospect,

13:12.093 --> 13:20.065
I think I made the right choice as far as the 
profession goes. It's still exciting. It's still

13:21.087 --> 13:21.728
fun. I like going to sea.

13:25.754 --> 13:32.465
I haven't experienced any real difficulties in 
funding and ship time, by and large. I guess I'm

13:32.485 --> 13:40.497
probably about as close as being reasonably 
satisfied with what I'm doing as you can find

13:32.485 --> 13:40.497
anywhere.

13:42.721 --> 14:10.264
you don't know how many of the decisions you made in 
the past you know were really up for you to make and

13:42.721 --> 14:10.264
how you end up how you ended up at this point um I 
guess you know the old saying is if I had to do it all

13:42.721 --> 14:10.264
over again I probably would so I have no real 
regrets about it we've all well we all when I think

13:42.721 --> 14:10.264
of we all I think of my family and and stuff we really 
have no gripes so I'm happy with what I'm doing. You

14:15.277 --> 14:19.622
can always think of some better places or some 
other places you might think would be better. My

14:20.463 --> 14:31.595
experience has been that the quantity of problems 
are always the same as the quality that differs,

14:20.463 --> 14:31.595
and so all in all, I guess I'm quite satisfied with 
it. Now, in terms of biographical data, did your

14:33.457 --> 14:40.504
family urge you to enter oceanography or not urge 
you to enter oceanography? they never thought I

14:40.872 --> 14:42.314
was gonna go to college. So it's uh, well it was kind 
of, you've probably heard this many times

14:42.334 --> 15:08.972
yourself, I was the youngest of four, and being the 
youngest of four, of course you had a baby, and my

14:42.334 --> 15:08.972
brothers are quite a bit older than I am, and when I 
got out of high school I was digging clams

14:42.334 --> 15:08.972
commercially on Long Island, Heck, I didn't want 
to go to college. I was making, actually at that

15:11.306 --> 15:20.536
time, which would have been fifty-four, 
fifty-five, somewhere around there, I was

15:11.306 --> 15:20.536
knocking out two or three thousand bucks a month. 
And, you know, for a seventeen, eighteen year old

15:20.557 --> 15:24.421
kid, that's an awful lot of money. So, but at, all 
along, ever since I was, it must have been about

15:25.542 --> 15:37.575
ten, I started working, and I've always had, you 
know, some coins jingling in my pocket. I like to

15:38.365 --> 15:40.187
think I've tried almost everything. My family was 
in the confectionery business and used to make ice

15:41.509 --> 15:48.737
cream and candy and worked in bakery shops and set 
pins. I drove trucks, worked in butcher shops,

15:48.777 --> 15:56.567
worked on farms in upstate New York. And when it was 
decided, well, it wasn't I didn't decide. I had a

16:01.993 --> 16:04.055
brother that came home from the Korean War. And I 
guess I was hanging around with a pretty fast

16:05.197 --> 16:07.900
crowd. he decided I was going to go to college, and 
we had a little set, too, in the backyard, and I got a

16:08.723 --> 16:30.992
black eye and an application to college, and I 
applied to Cornell to the ag school, and they

16:08.723 --> 16:30.992
accepted me, which was really a surprise, because 
I was just in the upper half of my graduating class

16:08.723 --> 16:30.992
in high school, and then, you know, all sorts of 
crazy things happened. When I went off to college,

16:31.012 --> 16:35.878
I found out they paid people to do this kind of 
stuff, and as an undergraduate, I worked for my

16:36.854 --> 16:42.942
major professor and ran his field program, ran to 
Boats primarily, and it's been fun. So that's sort

16:44.384 --> 16:48.649
of a crazy way you get into these things. Is there 
anybody with whom you came into contact in your

16:49.510 --> 16:55.718
academic career who helped shape your future in 
particular? Well, probably the people who sort of

16:57.661 --> 17:04.009
pushed me ahead

17:05.980 --> 17:07.462
at both Woods Hole and Scripps. I never really sat 
down and hammered out, you might say, scientific

17:08.923 --> 17:25.043
ideas with these people, but they almost 
invariably

17:08.923 --> 17:25.043
put me into positions where I could do things that I 
wanted to do, which wasn't always the general

17:08.923 --> 17:25.043
case. And he said, well, the guy who ran the group 
down at Scripps, Morris Blackburn, this

17:25.463 --> 17:34.654
Australian, who was a funny kind of a guy, At the 
time, I didn't fully appreciate him, but he was a

17:35.495 --> 17:46.165
heck of a good manager, you know, and he did a lot of 
things for us that we, the scientists in the group,

17:35.495 --> 17:46.165
they could never have done it themselves.

17:48.728 --> 18:00.299
When I went off to Woods Hole, I was with the Reiser 
group up there, and the opportunities to do things

17:48.728 --> 18:00.299
were just all over the place, and all you had to do 
was do them. And I don't know whether know this was

18:04.402 --> 18:32.586
done on purpose because the other younger guys in 
the group I mean we all had the same opportunities

18:04.402 --> 18:32.586
and had opportunities to design cruises to areas 
that we wanted to go to we could you know raise

18:04.402 --> 18:32.586
questions and collect data to answer them and so I 
think I've just been very lucky all along the way to

18:04.402 --> 18:32.586
be associated with people who who had good things 
happen to them that's one one cruise over I guess

18:33.899 --> 19:00.733
one of the things that sort of summarized this up is 
uh we had a cruise off Africa and there was a kid on

18:33.899 --> 19:00.733
the boat I used to get dysentery every time he went 
three miles from the United States every time he

18:33.899 --> 19:00.733
got on the boat he got seasick and I went down we were 
checking on him to see if he was still alive because

18:33.899 --> 19:00.733
we didn't carry doctors in those days and he'd been 
crawling out of state room to go to the head and the

18:33.899 --> 19:00.733
steel door slammed on his hand and he's laying 
there on the floor And I woke up to him, and I shake

19:01.186 --> 19:04.429
him, and I say, Lou, are you okay? And he looks up to 
me, and he says, stick with Lorenzen, and good

19:04.469 --> 19:08.893
things will happen. But, you know, at the time I 
left Woods Hole to go down to NSF, it was, again, it

19:10.735 --> 19:18.802
was a personality problem. It was a shootout. I was 
ticked off. Everybody, the guys I was having

19:21.325 --> 19:24.447
fights with were ticked off. And in retrospect, it 
was one of the luckiest things I ever did, was go up

19:24.508 --> 19:30.433
to the Science Foundation. leaving Scripps, 
going to Woods Hole was, again, one of the luckiest

19:30.650 --> 19:35.074
things I've ever did, you know. And,

19:35.314 --> 19:59.475
you know, people ask you how do you describe 
yourself, you know, as far as various attributes,

19:35.314 --> 19:59.475
and one thing is that I guess I come out looking like 
an extremely good biological opportunist, or an

19:35.314 --> 19:59.475
opportunist in a biological sense, and I think 
I've been able to make the best out of wherever I

19:35.314 --> 19:59.475
happen to fall. You know, the old thing of falling 
into, you know, a lot becomes smelling like the

19:59.708 --> 20:03.013
rose. And again, I would like to think some of it's 
luck and some of it has to do with sort of insight.

20:11.284 --> 20:26.385
I'm not willing to say which is which, but I think, 
you know, all along the way I've been, I've done

20:11.284 --> 20:26.385
well, and whether it's I've had anything to do with 
it or some other external force, I can't knock it.

20:27.246 --> 20:28.888
You know, it just seems to be... They seem to come 
out reasonably well. I can't complain.
