WEBVTT

00:04.874 --> 00:08.358
You were talking about that being the only form of 
entertainment. Can you think of any others that

00:08.398 --> 00:13.763
might have gone on that the boys did or the faculty 
amused themselves with? Well, of course, the

00:14.864 --> 00:31.341
faculty played bridge, or whist at that time it was 
called, and had formal dances using the missile. I

00:31.361 --> 00:34.324
mean, the... Shirley... for the faculty. The 
students were going to have a dance. They used the

00:38.547 --> 00:39.788
mess hall.

00:42.611 --> 00:45.595
Now, you were single for how long there? Well, I was 
single all along then. I came back here single

00:47.497 --> 00:49.339
after the war. I didn't marry until 21. Did the 
single faculty members ever date any of the girls

00:52.943 --> 00:56.467
in Bryan?

01:00.071 --> 01:01.693
Or did they have time to get out? Oh, my goodness. 
Why, man? Dear human. Oh, well, I know that, but I

01:05.101 --> 01:08.766
was just wondering if that's where they went to 
brine. Sure, well, there was a trotter line. Were

01:11.911 --> 01:15.636
there lots of single girls in brine then? Well, I 
would say there were plenty for the faculty. Some

01:19.782 --> 01:22.726
of them married the faculty men, some of them 
married students. Some of those girls in brine

01:22.746 --> 01:28.334
married students, and some did marry tall.

01:31.438 --> 01:34.062
Well, I don't know. None of this stuff I'm telling 
you is of any value. You ask a question that they

01:40.848 --> 01:43.631
have dances. Yes, the men, we'd have a dance at the 
Shirley,

01:45.874 --> 02:04.993
and we'd go down, get our dates and walk them down to 
the trolley line and rack them out on the trolley.

02:06.475 --> 02:08.358
11.30, we'd take them back. Then we'd walk home. 
All the way from Bryan? Sure. It was about, what,

02:13.166 --> 02:14.448
six miles? Five. Five. Take about? About an hour 
and a half. About an hour and a half. Yeah. But you

02:21.099 --> 02:26.888
know, all the ladies, after having a dance with the 
beautiful lady, you could walk ten miles. So you

02:27.028 --> 02:28.230
all get back then? 1, 2 o'clock the next morning. 
Oh, yes. These dances were usually, what, on a

02:32.641 --> 02:34.743
Saturday night? Oh, yes. They'd be on a Saturday 
night. I see. Now, later on, we began to have dances

02:38.188 --> 02:46.678
in the gymnasium. I don't know how much you got on 
Charlie Moran. Very little. Charlie Moran's one

02:51.243 --> 02:54.086
of the great men that's ever been to this 
institution.

02:57.270 --> 02:58.892
What do you remember about him? Everything good. 
Everything good. Could you tell us a little bit

03:02.775 --> 03:04.937
about it? Well, I came here, and Charlie, his wife, 
and his son, Charles Jr., was living upstairs over

03:04.957 --> 03:16.609
the, over the Shirley. And Charlie participated 
in our after supper boxing contest. Oh now, you all

03:27.458 --> 03:29.901
boxed after supper? Oh yes. I see. Where did you all 
box? Where did this take place? In the Shirley? Oh

03:34.886 --> 03:35.626
no, no. Outdoors or if it's in some of the rooms in 
the Shirley Annex. I saw John Griswold, a

03:41.112 --> 03:51.643
professor of veterinary, no, animal husbandry, 
hit Si Evans on the chin and dropped him behind the

03:52.838 --> 04:00.546
trunk, and we had to almost tear the building down 
to get Si out the back of the trunk.

04:03.909 --> 04:04.870
Oh, my goodness. How often did this take place? 
Every evening? It could be every evening. There

04:09.675 --> 04:11.737
was no set. There was just nothing set about it. Did 
everybody participate? Oh, no. No, no. There were

04:17.002 --> 04:19.825
a bunch of fellas that were... more lace on their 
pants that wouldn't participate. But Charlie

04:26.495 --> 04:34.384
would, and he'd get in there, and Charlie'd get 
mad, and that was fun, to haul up and suck him and

04:26.495 --> 04:34.384
make him mad.

04:37.047 --> 04:41.692
But getting mad didn't last. It was fun to wrap one 
around his ear, You say that Coach Moran

04:47.024 --> 04:52.471
participated. Was he a good boxer? Fair. None of 
them were going to challenge

04:54.995 --> 05:04.528
Ed Hamlin. Neither or none of them would have 
challenged Ed Hamlin.

05:13.450 --> 05:19.518
They didn't have, when I came here, football was 
played on the drill field. It was. And they passed

05:22.481 --> 05:29.210
the hat to get any funds that was, to get men.

05:33.075 --> 05:35.217
Baseball was played on the drill field. They 
passed the hat. Now this is the drill field you're

05:36.279 --> 05:40.404
talking about, the one that's now in front of the 
MSC? Yeah. Okay. Now, in the summer of 1911,

05:42.965 --> 05:59.544
a boy by the name of Kyle, who was on the board of 
directors, an uncle to E.J. Kyle,

05:59.564 --> 06:09.816
arranged for a bit of land to be set aside

06:13.053 --> 06:14.594
for the athletic department. Up until that time, 
they had not had an athletic director. Charlie was

06:17.597 --> 06:19.739
the first athletic director. Now this Kyle you 
spoke of, do you remember his initials? Dr. Allen

06:23.743 --> 06:25.564
Kyle. I see. And where was he? He was Houston. He was 
in Houston. Do you remember anything else about

06:30.709 --> 06:32.211
him? What he did for a living? He was a doctor. Oh, he 
was an M.D. I see. Okay, go ahead. Well,

06:43.985 --> 06:49.835
They have a football game, and it rained. The drill 
field wasn't fit to drill on for quite a while. So in

06:56.365 --> 07:09.587
the interim, until they got this field that Kyle 
had set out, they moved around the corner about

06:56.365 --> 07:09.587
where those tennis courts are, If you know, as you 
go around the corner from MSC, heading down toward

07:10.917 --> 07:14.923
the... There are a bunch of tennis courts over 
there. It's behind. It's back of Kyle Field. No,

07:21.552 --> 07:22.333
it's this way. Now, wait a minute. I'll take it 
back. They've got an athletic dormitory going in

07:27.260 --> 07:30.405
there now. Okay, I know what you're talking about. 
All right. That used to be... You see... I'm behind

07:35.512 --> 07:36.273
you. I'm out of date. But that was... And they set 
that out to play football on. I see. And the fall of

07:44.618 --> 07:47.501
1911, they played football there. Charlie, by 
midnight requisitioning,

07:49.763 --> 08:06.000
begging, borrowing, stealing, and everything 
possible, got together enough stuff to enclose

08:07.330 --> 08:14.077
This athletic field that was set out by members of 
the board of directors under the instance of Dr.

08:07.330 --> 08:14.077
Kyle. Now, you're talking about not where the 
tennis courts are, but now we're talking about the

08:14.358 --> 08:18.683
new place. I'm talking about Kyle Field. That area 
right there. We're inside of Kyle Field now. Now,

08:25.050 --> 08:27.633
that was not originally college land? Oh, yes. It 
was old college land, but it was set aside. it was

08:32.947 --> 08:37.371
part of the agronomy, a test lab. He took it away 
from them and gave it to the athletic department. I

08:41.495 --> 08:41.675
see. Since he was on the board of directors, he 
could do this. Oh yes, oh yes. And don't get the idea

08:46.920 --> 08:48.782
that E.J. Kyle had anything to do with this, 
although in 1925, after his uncle died, he went to

08:48.802 --> 09:01.975
the board of directors and asked the board of 
directors to say that Kyle Field was named for him.

09:08.090 --> 09:08.631
And they did. And they did. So it is named for him. 
No. In a way. No. Well, I understand the point, but

09:13.897 --> 09:18.262
yeah, I see what he did. All right. Now,

09:19.824 --> 09:28.133
Charlie called that area Kyle Field. But, as I 
said, by every way he could do it. He didn't have any

09:33.869 --> 09:34.690
money. Use of students for labor, faculty members 
for labor, all of it shelled out money. I'd give

09:43.843 --> 09:47.108
him, of course, I'd give him something down to as 
much as 50 cents.

09:50.053 --> 09:53.337
And he'd take up a collection of something. He 
needed something, and the fellow... He just

09:55.000 --> 09:56.121
passed the hat. The hat, yeah. And with his energy 
and hard work of his own, they built a gymnasium

09:57.963 --> 10:21.112
that

09:57.963 --> 10:21.112
had, believe it or not, hot and running water and a 
place to play basketball. My goodness. It's a good

10:23.595 --> 10:24.276
building. It's well put together. It's a double 
floor deal. Mm-hmm. And

10:28.726 --> 10:42.061
the

10:28.726 --> 10:42.061
faculty then moved their dancers from the Shirley 
down there. We just had to walk another half mile,

10:42.081 --> 10:44.424
that's all. It didn't make any difference in those 
days. And

10:47.827 --> 10:52.873
the students still continue. When they had 
Thanksgiving and Easter and the final, or in the

10:56.840 --> 11:02.548
domes or in the missiles.

11:02.568 --> 11:07.816
But Charlie, in the fall of 1912, now you're going 
to have to check these dates. I'm not sure about

11:07.836 --> 11:10.160
this date. I think in the fall of 1912, he brought 
Leo Betray in, who was an All-American football

11:10.180 --> 11:21.496
player from Chicago and All-American 
basketball, I think. But at any rate, he was a

11:22.338 --> 11:24.341
basketball player. He may not have been an 
All-American. to help him as a coach they had no

11:27.367 --> 11:52.834
basketball team so ron hanson a student here had 
played basketball in houston

11:27.367 --> 11:52.834
and they tagged him for captain he had some 
experience and they organized a basketball team

11:54.181 --> 12:00.449
But they had nobody to play until, oh, I reckon, I 
guess Bill was the first intercollegiate they

11:54.181 --> 12:00.449
played. There again, you'd have to check the 
figures on it because. But in order for the boys to

12:04.573 --> 12:14.786
have some practice, a bunch of the younger 
instructors would organize them a basketball

12:04.573 --> 12:14.786
team and played them. I see. And most of them, as I 
told, where are you from? Corpus Christi. Well,

12:24.185 --> 12:31.896
there was a Baptist preacher in Galveston that was 
one of the most famous Baptist preachers in Texas.

12:33.298 --> 12:42.470
And I told Bailey Stone that when I came here, he 
tried to take my place off the Best Man Athletic

12:33.298 --> 12:42.470
Club's basketball team, but he couldn't. He 
wasn't bloodthirsty enough. Because you take a

12:46.896 --> 12:53.145
move there, you have a fellow playing basketball, 
and he's supposed to have some skin places. coming

12:53.648 --> 12:55.391
off and a little blood flowing. Well, this bunch of 
instructors had been taught, they had come up

12:56.954 --> 13:07.252
under that rough little way of playing. Well, in 
1920 they changed all that, and even today it's

13:08.073 --> 13:13.142
rough now. But if you'd have left the rules like 
they were back there, there would have been mayhem

13:14.692 --> 13:19.258
on every game. Basketball was a contact sport 
then? Oh, yes.

13:26.907 --> 13:28.709
You get the ball, I take it away from you. I see. 
There weren't any fouls then, huh? Yes, there were

13:33.235 --> 13:40.484
fouls, but if you had that ball and I got my hand on 
it, you and I would have a wrestling match, and that

13:33.235 --> 13:40.484
was not a foul. I see. And? And you played on this 
team for how long? Well, this is just this year,

13:46.847 --> 13:48.688
that one year. That one year. Because of the fact 
that the students, after that, they had plenty of

13:49.569 --> 13:53.893
competition. And they had plenty of substitutes 
and so on. But the faculty helped make the

14:00.059 --> 14:05.204
basketball team in, I think it was 1912. Remember 
anything else about Charlie Moran? And Charlie,

14:09.028 --> 14:11.310
as I said, was a baseball coach.

14:14.159 --> 14:20.068
And he did not attempt to coach baseball. D. 
Tracher did that. Charlie coached baseball, and

14:22.171 --> 14:26.277
he had a good baseball team. So he had football and 
baseball. Yeah. And about 1913, I guess it was,

14:29.521 --> 14:43.862
maybe 14, I don't remember, A&M played the 
University of Texas two or three times, the ground

14:44.922 --> 14:50.387
up with them. And the University of Texas 
complained that Charlie Moran was coaching dirty

14:50.407 --> 14:59.456
football, and they wouldn't play A&M anymore 
until they got rid of Charlie Moran. And A&M

15:00.817 --> 15:05.461
College got rid of one of the best coaches they ever 
had. He was fired here? Yeah, he was fired. Do you

15:10.006 --> 15:14.490
know where he went? College, and I never saw 
Charlie anymore until A&M Beach Center College in

15:14.757 --> 15:27.674
Christmas of 21-22 in Dallas. And I just married. I 
took my wife over to that dressing room, and she is

15:32.200 --> 15:44.376
very, very timid and sensitive, but I dragged her 
in that room to see Charlie, and these men had

15:32.200 --> 15:44.376
undershirts and so on, and She'd be blushed all 
over, but she met Charlie Moran. It was the only

15:49.017 --> 15:50.458
time she ever met him. I saw Charlie a couple more 
times after that. Charlie got up off the bed and

15:53.882 --> 16:03.513
quit cussing and walked over and put his arm around 
her and kissed her. That scared her.

16:10.090 --> 16:13.434
Well, he was, but he made the athletic department. 
Sounds like he built it almost single-handedly.

16:15.616 --> 16:17.839
He did, he did. You can't say anything against 
Charlie for me.

16:23.085 --> 16:34.958
That dirty playing that the university hollered 
was a case of pot calling the kettle black.

16:34.978 --> 16:39.844
And where the dirty playing has been, the 
university has done more than they shall. And if

16:41.258 --> 16:52.072
A&M violates the rules of today, the 
interscholastic rules, collegiate rules today,

16:41.258 --> 16:52.072
the least bit, we get censured. The University of 
Texas busts them a little wide open, come in and go

16:52.092 --> 17:00.022
in, and nobody says anything.

17:00.122 --> 17:00.823
Am I prejudiced? Yes, I'm prejudiced. That's not 
what you mean. All right, now I don't see where they

17:05.830 --> 17:07.672
are at either. Coming back here, Perea, It was just 
at the interim, and Grisel came in. Grisel had a

17:15.606 --> 17:21.856
doctor's degree in education, and he came here. He 
was teaching in Navasota as superintendent

17:22.677 --> 17:30.970
of the schools. They brought him here,

17:30.990 --> 17:40.105
and he came in with a lot of friction from top to 
bottom.

17:44.050 --> 17:48.195
with not so much from the students as from the 
faculty. And he gave here and didn't give there,

17:48.215 --> 18:01.930
and he finally worked that out until

17:48.215 --> 18:01.930
things were very, worked out very nicely. And he 
begun to build the institution as an educational

18:02.430 --> 18:06.194
institution. And he left here in 26, 25, to go to 
Oklahoma, and taking his place was Walton. Walton

18:21.157 --> 18:25.783
was another great man.

18:25.803 --> 18:34.153
I had a man

18:25.803 --> 18:34.153
tell me when I was in Amarillo, we're going to have 
to get rid of Walton. I said, what's the matter?

18:38.859 --> 18:43.605
We want so-and-so to be, him to hire so-and-so, and 
he won't do it. I turned to this man and I said, you

18:46.100 --> 19:03.808
want to congratulate the state of Texas on having a 
man as president of this institution that puts

18:46.100 --> 19:03.808
principle above politics? The fellow looked at me 
and he said, I guess you're right. But he didn't

19:06.593 --> 19:07.514
quit. They kept nibbling at him because he would 
not. Hire certain individuals.

19:30.309 --> 19:34.674
Apologies.

19:34.694 --> 19:34.995
. . .

19:40.977 --> 19:59.118
And

19:40.977 --> 19:59.118
he was one of the strong men. A lot of folks didn't 
like him. You go down there and go in his office, and

20:02.983 --> 20:10.191
he might run you out and just climb all over you. I 
never had Gibb do that to me. The reason is, if I went

20:15.446 --> 20:23.035
in to ask Gibb for a favor, I had a whole lot more 
bricks in my pocket than he had in his. I knew what I

20:24.597 --> 20:28.542
wanted, why I wanted, what it was going to cost, and 
everything about it. Most of these folks that went

20:29.123 --> 20:39.756
in and asked for appropriations from him really 
hadn't done

20:29.123 --> 20:39.756
their midnight oil work. And he would know more 
about what they wanted than they did, and he'd come

20:40.124 --> 20:48.152
and run them out and tell them not to come back until 
they knew what they wanted.

20:51.816 --> 20:55.079
And I found a gib by Jimenez. If he said yes, he meant 
yes. And that's something that in places of that

20:57.762 --> 21:03.207
type is rather unusual.

21:07.491 --> 21:10.114
You thought then that he was very fair and honest? 
very have you gotten any different ideas no no i

21:10.583 --> 21:29.892
think there's some people i've run into people who 
didn't like him but purely on personality not on

21:10.583 --> 21:29.892
anything that is it he he'd run him out of his office 
i mean run him out Get out. Get out. Get out. I did

21:33.054 --> 21:39.323
have one comment that Gibb really created the 
Department of Chemical Engineering. Who did?

21:39.984 --> 21:40.945
Gibb Gilchrist. He did more to start it. No. No? No. 
Gibb Gilchrist did what had been promised. By who?

21:52.622 --> 21:53.123
Bazell. Bazell? And that is to separate the 
Department of Chemical Engineering from the

21:54.745 --> 22:00.233
Department of Chemistry. And

22:00.517 --> 22:11.548
when I went into the Extension Service, that's the 
first thing that was done.

22:14.351 --> 22:22.919
And the fellow that they brought in here was a 
fellow by the name of

22:14.351 --> 22:22.919
Ruth.

22:26.003 --> 22:28.465
It was not a clean-cut schism. They quit calling it 
the Department of Chemistry and Chemical

22:30.875 --> 22:40.864
Engineering and were calling it the Department of 
Chemistry and the Department of Chemical

22:30.875 --> 22:40.864
Engineering, but it was still under Hedges.

22:44.928 --> 22:57.719
And Ruth got the notion that he was the last word in 
the operation of the Department of Chemical

22:44.928 --> 22:57.719
Engineering. And Hedges didn't have that idea. 
real quick.

23:07.786 --> 23:09.869
And they brought John Lindsey in. If you've talked 
to John Lindsey, who was head of the Department of

23:11.251 --> 23:19.943
Chemical Engineering, he came here, I would say, 
in 37. Could you tell us a little bit about C.C.

23:23.788 --> 23:24.509
Hedges? Who? C.C. Hedges. Could you tell us a 
little bit about him? He has kind of an interesting

23:28.314 --> 23:31.999
reputation.

23:34.409 --> 23:39.316
There again, you're talking to a fellow that 
thinks Hedges is handed down from heaven.

23:41.139 --> 23:44.323
Do you think he was a good administrator there? 
Yes, he was, but he was not amenable to,

23:44.464 --> 23:56.942
you might say, give and take. Hedges came here in 
the fall 1912, I guess. No.

24:10.300 --> 24:12.923
Could have been. Yeah. As professor of 
agricultural chemistry and organic. And they

24:21.914 --> 24:22.955
fired G.S. Fraps at that time out of the 
department, put him back on an experiment station

24:22.975 --> 24:27.180
to stay.

24:30.637 --> 24:33.520
And what are you grinning about? Fraps is one of my 
favorites. Go ahead. I've been reading about him.

24:37.243 --> 24:38.785
I never met the man, don't know him. He was long gone 
by the time I ever arrived, but I read a lot of his

24:38.865 --> 24:44.591
stuff, and he's kind of an interesting person. Do 
you know anybody that liked him? I haven't met

24:48.054 --> 24:52.458
anybody that liked him, but he wrote 
prolifically. And 50% of them should have stayed

24:52.658 --> 24:57.403
in the... typewriter. It may well be. I'm not a 
chemist, but I've been going through a lot of stuff

25:00.307 --> 25:08.214
and just wrote and wrote and wrote forever and I was 
just wondering what kind of a man he was. A

25:08.234 --> 25:10.216
self-made son of a bitch. Take that off of this. 
It's kind of like the old story that some of us are

25:14.820 --> 25:21.726
born bastards and some of us make it meritorious.

25:21.746 --> 25:23.007
You take that off of this. Okay, I will. But Hedges, 
I told you that Blake gave me a bunch of bologna, why

25:29.480 --> 25:40.212
I should stay. Well, he gave Hedges the same stuff. 
Hedges told me, I said, well, I went through that,

25:43.416 --> 25:45.919
too. But he was made head of the department, and 
Blake left the following year, in 13. Hedges was

25:58.235 --> 26:03.421
made head of the department.

26:03.441 --> 26:17.357
He was a perfectionist, I guess I would like to use 
that word, perfectionist, and couldn't tolerate

26:03.441 --> 26:17.357
sloppy

26:03.441 --> 26:17.357
work. And as a result, there were a lot of fellows 
that didn't like Hedges.

26:28.627 --> 26:43.982
I

26:28.627 --> 26:43.982
came back in 1919 as head of the department of 
chemical engineering, the division of chemical

26:28.627 --> 26:43.982
engineering.

26:44.002 --> 26:51.229
He gave me almost as near as he ever gave anybody 
free hand to do as I pleased.

26:54.112 --> 26:57.655
And he had a stiff leg. I could have killed him for 
that.

27:02.614 --> 27:10.225
He fell

27:02.614 --> 27:10.225
on the stairway and sprained his knee. I helped 
pick him up, put him in a car, and told him to take him

27:12.288 --> 27:17.035
to the hotel. You know what that sucker did? The 
fellow started off and he said, stop. He got out of

27:24.046 --> 27:27.591
the car and came on back with that knee. in the shape 
it was, in a horrible shape. That night, I put a

27:31.948 --> 27:45.388
towel, it's not a hot towel, I just took a wet towel, 
warm, put it around his leg, and I said, you leave it

27:31.948 --> 27:45.388
there until morning. I said, I'm going to sweat 
that knee down. I said, that rag is not hot. It'll

27:50.996 --> 27:53.460
get warm from the fever in your knee.

27:58.840 --> 28:00.882
Next morning, that rag was on the floor. Said it got 
too hot. He came back here and went to a doctor, and

28:02.263 --> 28:09.089
the doctor drew the water off of the knee, and that 
was it. So he had a stiff knee. But, and he was a

28:13.934 --> 28:16.396
firecracker. In a way, he'd fly off the handle real 
quick.

28:24.363 --> 28:26.665
But Harold Brayton and I didn't pay any attention 
to it. Just let him blow. Other people couldn't

28:29.806 --> 28:32.952
tolerate that. So I imagine you have a lot of people 
that didn't care much for Hedges. That's

28:39.424 --> 28:44.073
interesting to get both sides' personality, 
though.

28:45.195 --> 28:48.381
I thought well and all of him. And, well, personal 
things come in there, lots of them. By the way,

28:55.928 --> 29:00.013
Bolton taught me physics in Mississippi A&M. 
Surprising how many people from Mississippi A&M

29:00.854 --> 29:03.958
showed up here. Well, you take, Cornell was from 
Mississippi. He was from Starkville. Harrington

29:10.867 --> 29:12.229
was from Starkville.

29:15.774 --> 29:18.597
Cornell went from here to Oklahoma.

29:21.982 --> 29:23.083
During that period,

29:25.595 --> 29:33.448
I would say at one time we had 20% of the younger 
staff of the Mississippi A&M. I wonder why. Well,

29:35.771 --> 29:38.335
there was Bolton and Harrington.

29:41.380 --> 29:42.442
They knew the men. They didn't know the others. And 
Mississippi, at that time, Mississippi A&M,

29:52.274 --> 29:55.537
was one of the leading Southern colleges. They 
faded. I thought of picking it up again. They've

30:01.783 --> 30:03.865
become what now, Mississippi State? Yeah, it's 
Mississippi State.

30:11.593 --> 30:20.762
But as I said, Bolton, you'd probably get a better, 
as good a picture from others as you will from me,

30:11.593 --> 30:20.762
and we was taking time then. Tom Harrington 
graduated from engineering in 1923. And we got him

30:27.321 --> 30:32.388
a job in Texas Company. In 24, I believe it was, he 
showed up here. He had quit, and he wanted to teach.

30:40.941 --> 30:44.707
That's what he wanted to do, he wanted to teach. So 
we put him on. and he finally wound up, as you see

30:47.962 --> 30:52.889
here, president of the institution. And Tom did a 
good work.

30:59.057 --> 31:11.033
Tom was not, was there in the beginning of the 
explosion and

30:59.057 --> 31:11.033
was not fully Didn't fully use it, but Earl Rudder 
took full use of the explosion. That's financial.

31:22.094 --> 31:24.857
You take, Earl Rudder got a hundred million 
dollars. Well, you take a hundred million dollars

31:26.118 --> 31:30.744
and drop it on the campus at A&M College and 
something's going to yield. And since that time, I

31:32.626 --> 31:42.437
imagine that the university, the university has 
gotten a neighborhood of 200, get us a thousand, I

31:32.626 --> 31:42.437
mean a million. right in the neighborhood of 200 
million dollars from the government. And that, in

31:48.374 --> 31:51.678
all, in all payments. There may be more. But you 
take that amount of money and put it in a little

31:53.560 --> 31:58.486
community like this, something's going to give. 
And you've got these high-rise buildings there

31:59.508 --> 32:04.794
that originally didn't have money enough to make a 
low-rise building there.

32:07.758 --> 32:07.918
You see? It's really grown to the extent that at one 
time, about a year and a half ago, we had more

32:09.080 --> 32:20.174
buildings, we had more money in buildings under 
construction than the campus was worth in 1950.

32:20.314 --> 32:21.997
Oh, yes. Oh, my Lord, yes. In 1914,

32:23.278 --> 32:34.232
they were figuring on giving it away and moving the 
college up between Dallas and Fort Worth. I didn't

32:34.473 --> 32:35.494
know that. Who was the instigator of this? I don't 
remember. Do you remember the Old Main fire? Do you

32:42.123 --> 32:43.485
remember the Old Main fire? Oh, yes. When it burned 
down. Do you know anything about the story of that

32:45.187 --> 32:47.129
fire? Do you have any idea why it burned or maybe who 
burned it if it wasn't intentional? Well,

32:52.956 --> 33:01.846
anything that I would say other than what you know 
would be just supposition because I don't know. I

33:02.667 --> 33:03.809
don't think anybody does.

33:06.852 --> 33:07.453
It's...

33:11.534 --> 33:22.745
It's a mean thing, but as I said, I wouldn't want to 
even speculate at all, because I will say this. In

33:22.765 --> 33:30.092
fact, in the early days, there were no women 
working on the campus. To put stenographers on the

33:31.273 --> 33:38.200
campus would put temptation in the minds of the 
students, and that couldn't be done. In 19, oh, I

33:39.698 --> 34:02.988
guess 1912, the

33:39.698 --> 34:02.988
Experiment

33:39.698 --> 34:02.988
Station wanted a, the

33:39.698 --> 34:02.988
college library had a woman assistant librarian, 
who later became Mrs. W.H. Thomas. a the uh

34:05.602 --> 34:31.778
experiment station had a woman librarian who also 
did a little writing for harrington and younger

34:05.602 --> 34:31.778
but officially the wall stenographers were men

34:05.602 --> 34:31.778
well the name of uh spence nagle had a 
stenographer, a man, that lived upstairs,

34:34.407 --> 34:40.292
anti-Godlin down the hall from me.

34:43.375 --> 34:52.243
One night, door opened, he came there and he said, I 
said, what are you doing in here, Jeffrey? He says,

34:52.263 --> 34:55.686
I think there's a fire somewhere.

34:58.009 --> 34:59.910
I threw, hit the floor running. I said, where? 
again. Follow me, guy, follow me." Well, then his

35:05.906 --> 35:07.708
bed was blazing. I picked it up and threw it out the 
window and gave him a boot. I said, next time you

35:12.033 --> 35:14.636
stay sober. But that wasn't, at that time Jeffrey 
didn't do that. And they started to investigate.

35:24.828 --> 35:30.334
Now this can't be documented because it's just 
simply, it's not hearsay and yet it's Well, go

35:31.158 --> 35:32.380
ahead. It actually occurred when the board of 
directors were very unhappy. They hadn't been

35:39.249 --> 35:45.917
able to get a stenographer to take the testimony.

35:45.937 --> 35:51.845
And Spence said, well, I've got a stenographer to 
take the testimony. He sent for Jeffrey. Jeffrey

35:54.468 --> 36:00.456
came in and was sort of like this, and what you want 
the Board of Directors chairman, I can't think of

36:01.634 --> 36:12.831
his name,

36:01.634 --> 36:12.831
said, can you take dictation of this testimony? He 
said, let her roll, guy, let her roll. And that is

36:19.301 --> 36:23.407
when they got the testimony they got with Jeffrey 
Ticket. Now, he lasted here a couple of years. Oh,

36:27.284 --> 36:28.085
about a year. I named him off, and last time he was 
president of the bank. He's done very well. He quit

36:33.331 --> 36:39.058
drinking, and he's done very

36:33.331 --> 36:39.058
well. Well, let's say I got your career up to 1935, 
and you went into the extension service. Could you

36:46.386 --> 36:51.192
tell us about that if you've got time to? You know, 
that's now, we're getting over into Baron

36:51.212 --> 36:55.637
Moonshousen's work. Who's that? The world's 
greatest fibber. Oh, okay.

37:08.020 --> 37:10.984
As I said, I was very unhappy.

37:13.307 --> 37:17.012
I couldn't get students jobs after four years.

37:20.637 --> 37:24.021
And Director Martin of the Extension Service 
conceived the idea that if they would build

37:25.283 --> 37:45.966
community centers out in the country from town 
that were self-supporting, that it would help

37:25.283 --> 37:45.966
the

37:25.283 --> 37:45.966
agriculture of the state.

37:48.689 --> 37:52.894
And, oh, just as a hobby, I'd been tanning lots of 
leather.

38:00.485 --> 38:04.530
And he came in and asked me if I could teach farmers 
to tan leather. I said, sure, if they'll do it. I

38:06.252 --> 38:07.353
said, a lot of work to it. He said, folks, we're not 
worrying about work now. They want to submit to

38:10.997 --> 38:12.699
goods.

38:15.863 --> 38:17.625
Well, I don't know whether I did right or wrong. My 
wife never did like it, but she tolerated it. I went

38:24.734 --> 38:37.586
over to the extension service, had a pretty nice 
raise in pay,

38:24.734 --> 38:37.586
and started off as a leather specialist, teaching 
writing and teaching farmers to turn leather. Tau

38:38.567 --> 38:43.031
hide sold for 25 cents, opossum skin for 35.

38:46.394 --> 38:54.201
And I've got some leather out there in the garage 
now that was built, that I was made in 1936. 1937.

38:54.888 --> 39:00.275
That leather

38:54.888 --> 39:00.275
is as good as any leather you ever saw.

39:03.278 --> 39:10.847
And we made, I helped tan and directed the tanning 
of over 200,000 hides. And these are car hides, not

39:12.529 --> 39:14.171
skins. We don't count skins. I think some of the 
romantic

39:24.809 --> 39:28.193
phase is in the skins. Women buy those tan skins and 
made themselves with fur coats. Yeah, lots of them

39:33.860 --> 39:35.122
made. I used to have to, they'd bring them to me, and 
they just didn't wear but a sack. And I'd haul up and

39:43.753 --> 39:47.357
gather them and show them how to gather them. And 
they'd wind up with a coat that would fit just like

39:47.377 --> 39:52.183
his, just about as good as the one he'd buy. But 
Martin, and in addition to that,

39:53.446 --> 40:12.706
he started in, not only that, he directed me to see 
what I could do about making, improving quality of

39:53.446 --> 40:12.706
syrup.

40:17.071 --> 40:22.677
And I'll guarantee you that I can take sorghum 
syrup and make you think it's ribbon cane. And it's

40:24.142 --> 40:26.404
easily done.

40:29.648 --> 40:34.272
Lord knows how much syrup I have made and directed. 
And I'm still getting letters from folks wanting

40:35.974 --> 40:41.520
to know how to make syrup.

40:45.164 --> 40:50.409
Did you ever do any work for the corn products 
company in there? No. I don't know.

40:53.892 --> 40:54.333
O.B. died about 36 or 37,

40:54.413 --> 41:02.244
and H.H. Williamson went into the job. Bill didn't 
see any, oh by the way, these, we made the community

41:05.789 --> 41:20.811
centers where the farmers would themselves do all 
the work and yet then get the benefit from it.

41:21.702 --> 41:25.047
There's one of those over here in Houston County. 
There were two or three of those around. And they

41:29.733 --> 41:33.117
functioned in the way that they were supposed to. 
Farmers by Jimenez would turn the leather there

41:33.258 --> 41:43.652
and wind up with hides and leather goods that they 
could never have bought. Make them themselves.

41:47.517 --> 41:49.920
Down here is a human interest story. Okay.
