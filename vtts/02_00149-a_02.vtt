WEBVTT

00:04.385 --> 00:25.124
The boys that lived in the house begged me to paddle 
them and I didn't paddle them because I didn't,

00:04.385 --> 00:25.124
they wanted to be able to say how much that they got, 
how much they suffered when they didn't suffer at

00:04.385 --> 00:25.124
all. But I was so annoyed about the hazing that I 
wouldn't use the board, and other than that, there

00:34.152 --> 00:44.067
was no hazing in the project houses.

00:46.531 --> 01:01.594
One of the students that was in the Lufkin house 
where I moved was a fellow by the name of Starr, and I

00:46.531 --> 01:01.594
was quite, and if you read my memoirs, get a lot of 
information about my relationship with the Starr

01:02.013 --> 01:07.220
family. I don't want to recount that now.

01:13.870 --> 01:20.419
And by then you were beginning to decide about 
being a dairy science major? That's right.

01:23.083 --> 01:27.649
Describe the routine of courses for a dairy 
science major.

01:30.160 --> 01:35.787
Well, in general, they were the same courses that 
all agriculture students took. There was not much

01:36.708 --> 01:39.672
difference. But my senior year, I decided that the 
prospects of getting a job in dairy

01:39.692 --> 01:59.577
field management, there was jobs available for 
dairy ice cream Production people, but not for

01:59.962 --> 02:06.371
herd work. And so I took 20 hours.

02:14.542 --> 02:23.033
And in addition, I audited four hours because I 
needed the course to have a double major. I was in

02:24.275 --> 02:28.240
class every hour in the week. And I was living in the 
dorm. but I was in class every hour in the week

02:30.539 --> 02:35.244
except religious emphasis week. And because of my 
heavy load, I was a distinguished student my

02:37.206 --> 02:45.195
senior year.

02:48.198 --> 02:56.968
A's count so much and B's count so much and I 
probably,

02:48.198 --> 02:56.968
I probably had a 1.7 or 9 or something. I really did 
not have a B average, and yet I was a distinguished

03:02.310 --> 03:10.825
student because I'd taken such a heavy load.

03:16.494 --> 03:23.766
Who were the key dairy science instructors in 
those days?

03:25.450 --> 03:26.091
Dean. Kyle? No, Shepard, who later became a 
Federal Reserve man, was an instructor. And

03:37.702 --> 03:43.488
Darnell was the dairy cattle judge coach. And I

03:45.069 --> 03:53.297
really didn't know anybody other than those two 
people. If you needed advice in those days about

03:54.155 --> 04:04.530
what courses to take or what to do, where did you go 
to seek advice and counsel?

04:09.176 --> 04:12.341
I don't know how to answer that question. It was 
just like this poll in the audience. But did Dan

04:18.016 --> 04:24.964
Russell, was he a person that would say, here's 
what you ought to do? No. We had no contact with him

04:27.047 --> 04:32.974
except as a supervisor.

04:36.298 --> 04:37.319
Go ahead. Were there nicknames for faculty 
members and students in those days? Yes, sir. What

04:43.226 --> 04:43.846
was yours? I never knew. I never knew. What were 
some that you remember for faculty? Head N. Jones

04:50.252 --> 04:53.856
was one of them in the chemistry. I

04:55.578 --> 05:03.707
don't remember. Did Dr. Russell have one yet? I 
didn't know it if he did. Because when I got there,

05:07.311 --> 05:11.496
he was Dr. Dan the grade point man. Supposedly that 
he would pass you if you would give any effort. By

05:18.543 --> 05:21.346
the way, what year did you get there? 1959. 1959. 
Same year Mr. Rutter got there a few months before I

05:24.089 --> 05:27.792
did. Is that right? Yes, sir. I always thought that 
they made a mistake when they let

05:30.735 --> 05:42.327
the Rutter preceding man Morgan? Right. I thought 
he was one of the more capable. He had the same ideas

05:49.916 --> 05:53.241
that later would become... I understand. Let's 
see.

06:01.472 --> 06:05.337
Describe the dormitory... When you lived in the 
dormitory on the campus, describe the routine of

06:05.357 --> 06:11.646
life in that dormitory. Well... Since they had two 
rooms of seniors, four people, and I was the fifth

06:15.567 --> 06:30.908
one, they put me in the same room with the first 
sergeant of the company. And I'd get up in time to

06:32.810 --> 06:37.116
get to the mess hall. And by the time I got through 
eating after serving the meals, I was on my way to

06:45.082 --> 06:46.844
class. I generally didn't have to go back to my 
room. And incidentally, 50 years after the fact, I

06:55.376 --> 07:09.334
found that my orderly was one of my competitors. 
compadres in the China, Burma, India campaign.

07:24.369 --> 07:25.971
He's a little older than I am. And I've recently 
contacted him and we've had dinner together. He's

07:31.257 --> 07:35.743
a little older than I am. Your task in the dining 
hall, what was your job there? I carried the trays.

07:47.531 --> 07:49.934
So you would report for breakfast at about what 
time? 6.15, 6.30. I don't remember exactly. But I

07:57.061 --> 08:03.267
had to be there ready to dish the food out They did 
give me one. They gave me the first table out of the

08:06.168 --> 08:12.777
door so I didn't have to carry the food to the far 
end. The freshmen did. But the people on my table

08:15.060 --> 08:19.767
were the staff of A&M. The cadet colonel and the 
lieutenant colonel and all of the staff officers.

08:26.146 --> 08:31.793
The big shots of that senior class were at the table 
I waited on. And how were you treated as a waiter by

08:31.893 --> 08:36.658
those people? No different than they would have 
treated any other person. Then you would eat

08:41.424 --> 08:47.231
quickly and head off to class for an 8 o'clock. 
That's right. Then you'd come back to begin your

08:48.332 --> 08:52.176
lunch assignment. As soon as I finished my 12 
o'clock class. And I'd eat quickly and go to my 1

08:55.981 --> 09:00.466
o'clock class my senior year. And then the same for 
supper. What time would you get through in the

09:03.108 --> 09:05.831
evening? I imagine 7, 7.15, something like that. 
And what dormitory did you live in that year? Ross

09:15.902 --> 09:16.422
Hall. Ross Hall. Describe it. Well, it was one of 
the oldest dormitories on the campus. And the

09:24.685 --> 09:33.138
latrine was on the bottom floor, and they finally 
installed a urinal on the third floor. And the

09:35.001 --> 09:42.072
rooms were fairly big

09:35.001 --> 09:42.072
enough as far as I'm concerned. And I sort of made it 
known that I didn't care what time my roommate came

09:43.855 --> 09:51.587
in at night. But he wasn't to come in and wake me up 
because he was drunk. And I made that, you know, I

09:56.517 --> 09:59.780
just leave it at that. I never went in hard. Hard. 
Hard haul? No. I'm talking about the very joint.

10:08.771 --> 10:09.672
Oh, hard liquors. Hard liquors. Hard liquors. I 
never went in hard liquors while I was there. Now,

10:13.376 --> 10:14.217
it was. south on Welborn Road, south of the campus. 
That's right. Where else, other than that, did

10:19.731 --> 10:23.456
Aggies drink beer? I don't know. Because to get 
whiskey, they had to go towards Snook, cross

10:27.921 --> 10:32.567
Whiskey Bridge. There was no place in downtown. 
I've never heard of a bootlegger in the county. No.

10:43.880 --> 10:49.826
When, on Saturday night, if you and some of your 
friends wanted to have a good time, where did y'all

10:43.880 --> 10:49.826
go? We went to a dormitory room and played bridge. I 
played bridge on Saturday night many, many times.

10:58.376 --> 10:58.916
No poker? No poker. I never played poker. Always 
bridge. It was a hard job to find four people to play

11:03.361 --> 11:09.668
bridge with on Saturday night.

11:11.352 --> 11:17.181
And how long did those bridge games sometimes 
last? Oh, till midnight. Okay. Then on Sunday

11:20.807 --> 11:23.571
afternoon, what did y'all do?

11:28.118 --> 11:30.562
I don't know how to answer that question. I just 
don't remember. What about, did you go to the clay

11:32.225 --> 11:33.727
pits? No. I spent my Sunday afternoon... on 
religious work, visiting students that I could

11:40.057 --> 11:47.046
find in their rooms. What about some good bull 
pranks and jokes that you remember that happened?

11:55.176 --> 12:01.243
What were some of the pranks that students played 
on somebody, whether you were involved or not?

12:03.066 --> 12:08.933
Well, Float Out, I guess you've heard of that, 
haven't you? pouring water on somebody from an

12:09.959 --> 12:12.802
upper story. I really don't have much comment on 
that. Did you go to any of the dances? No. Did you not

12:26.037 --> 12:29.220
believe in dancing or just didn't go? Well, I 
didn't go because I couldn't dance and I my

12:36.385 --> 12:40.289
religious faith was such that I probably would not 
have gone. I've never danced as far as that's

12:42.030 --> 12:45.393
concerned. Describe a football weekend in those 
years.

12:56.144 --> 13:04.131
Well, I had to go on the court trips, but I didn't 
have enough money to buy a ticket. And I'd stand at

13:05.663 --> 13:10.488
the gate till the half when they opened the gate and 
I'd go in. But one of the most lonesome trips I ever

13:12.390 --> 13:17.255
made was a court trip to Dallas. We had to go to 
Dallas. And when the game was over, I was wandering

13:21.520 --> 13:31.350
the streets of Dallas all by myself and it was as 
lonesome as I have been, except one other time I

13:33.052 --> 13:37.277
remember. When I lived on the poultry farm, I 
stayed there on Thanksgiving so everybody else

13:38.398 --> 13:43.884
could live. And the Mexicans were cleaning up the 
pasture back of the dairy farm, and those Mexicans

13:43.924 --> 14:00.162
would sing at night, and I couldn't understand a 
word, but they really sang very well. And I'd get so

14:00.242 --> 14:03.025
homesick that it is, It is really hard to hang 
around any longer.

14:10.121 --> 14:14.286
On that Dallas trip, you were lonesome because you 
were by yourself? That's right. What about a court

14:17.550 --> 14:19.412
trip to Austin? What was that like? Well,

14:22.035 --> 14:32.286
after the game, I caught a ride with friends of mine 
that were coming to Moody's. And I rode the Moody

14:33.143 --> 14:44.802
one Thanksgiving day from Austin Courtship in the 
rumble seat of a Model A Ford, I guess. And I had a

14:45.864 --> 14:50.592
blanket to keep the wind and rain off of me.

14:53.517 --> 14:55.700
Did any of your friends have a car? No.

15:03.974 --> 15:15.408
Let's see, who was the president when you were an 
undergraduate, A&M president?

15:15.428 --> 15:15.808
T.O. Walton. I had trouble getting that name. 
Describe him as you students thought of him. Well,

15:23.838 --> 15:29.966
my personal opinion was that he did a great job. And 
the fact that he was fired... because he couldn't

15:34.568 --> 15:39.696
run the college after he'd been there 24 years or 
some such figure. I don't know how long it was. But

15:41.999 --> 15:50.572
it offended me to say that, well, he can't run this 
college after he'd been there plenty of years. I

15:52.514 --> 15:54.938
had no personal contact with him at any time. Did 
you all see him very often?

16:01.508 --> 16:02.449
Not particularly. I didn't have any reason to see 
him. I didn't give him any reason to want to see me.

16:12.670 --> 16:19.098
The depression effects continued all the years 
while you were a student. Where did a student go if

16:21.101 --> 16:23.884
he was broke? Was there any place he could go to get 
some financial help? Well, The last year that I was

16:31.353 --> 16:41.566
in A&M, I was living in the dormitory, and I got a 
loan from the former students, $400. And the pay

16:43.088 --> 16:51.058
from the Army and the pay from the mess hall and the 
$400 I borrowed took care of my senior year. But I

16:52.519 --> 16:56.404
still didn't have enough money to buy a senior 
ring. And I got it in 1944. My kids got to have a

17:02.065 --> 17:08.272
senior ring the first day they qualified for it, 
grandkids. So that you didn't have a senior ring

17:08.412 --> 17:12.557
for ten years? Eight years. Eight years. Nine 
years, maybe. Since you have had that ring, are

17:17.483 --> 17:22.609
there any Aggie ring stories? Did you ever lose it 
or somebody notice it in a special place?

17:29.318 --> 17:36.525
Now then, when I taught at A&M, the students would 
see that ring, and they knew what it was. And the

17:38.026 --> 17:47.555
other thing is that this design was adopted in 
1935, my class, and it's been the same since 1935.

17:49.697 --> 17:56.743
And the other thing was the watch that were awarded 
to outstanding teachers, You told me that you got

17:57.719 --> 18:00.844
yours in 64. Yes, sir. I got mine in 65. And to one 
extent or another, mine won't keep time now

18:04.331 --> 18:12.565
because I don't move around enough. You've got to 
shake your hand and it'll run perfectly. until

18:20.669 --> 18:28.982
about time you get in bed and then it stops and you 
have to set it every morning so I don't wear it

18:20.669 --> 18:28.982
anymore.

18:33.248 --> 18:44.625
Religious emphasis week, describe what that was 
like when you were a student.

18:44.645 --> 18:45.006
Well, The date was set on 11 o'clock on Tuesday for a 
general convention. And then leaders from the

18:53.327 --> 19:01.098
different religious groups would come there in 
addition to the main speaker. And they would come

19:02.079 --> 19:11.773
there and would hold counseling sessions with the 
boys in the dormitory or in the YMCA or something

19:02.079 --> 19:11.773
like that. And... I didn't have any contact with 
them. I'm not sure that I even remember religious

19:17.221 --> 19:22.047
emphasis week as a student. I do as a faculty 
member. Guyon Hall was a key place for big events of

19:25.291 --> 19:35.424
movies and speakers and so forth, is that right? 
Right. Do you remember any famous people that came

19:37.407 --> 19:41.993
to the campus during your student years?

19:44.825 --> 19:45.546
Not really. Because President Roosevelt didn't 
come during those years, I don't think. That's

19:50.470 --> 19:51.992
right. Now then, after I was a staff member, I 
remember all of the famous people that were there.

19:59.038 --> 20:01.280
We'll get to those in a little bit. In

20:02.041 --> 20:13.832
Sabeasa in those days, they had the big dances and 
the parties, the cotton ball and all that. Right.

20:15.250 --> 20:22.299
What did you folks who worked in the dining hall, 
what arrangements did you all have to make to get

20:15.250 --> 20:22.299
ready for those? None. None? Okay. So that 
didn't... That didn't enter into our job in the

20:24.521 --> 20:29.968
mess hall.

20:33.332 --> 20:33.813
Let's see. How did an Aggie get a date in those days? 
There weren't any girls attending. He couldn't

20:43.415 --> 20:54.833
get a date at home because mothers of high school 
girls didn't want to have a college boy going with

20:43.415 --> 20:54.833
their daughter. So I didn't have a date. You didn't 
have dates all those years? That's right.

21:03.386 --> 21:06.030
Did you go to the movie much? After I moved in closer 
to the campus, I'd go once a month or something like

21:07.175 --> 21:12.940
that. Where? At the... Campus theater? Campus. 
No, not the campus theater. Or downtown? Oh, well,

21:20.086 --> 21:23.529
on the street there where Lupo's was. Oh, okay. 
See, there was a movie theater there, and it was

21:24.710 --> 21:32.256
just a few blocks from where I lived in the Ruffkin 
house. What else was there at the Northgate? What

21:35.139 --> 21:36.540
businesses and... Well, Lupo's had a business 
there. There's a barber shop, maybe two or three

21:42.470 --> 21:54.026
bookstores other than Northgate, restaurants or 
two. That was about all. Describe J.E. Lupo and his

21:57.611 --> 21:58.832
business. Well, Lupo was of a kind that they don't 
make anymore. And my experience with Lupo mostly

22:07.503 --> 22:18.319
came about because his son was in my boy scout troop 
when I was a scoutmaster. And I understand he had a

22:19.501 --> 22:28.955
file of old quizzes on genetics that he let people 
see it from time to time. It didn't bother me that he

22:29.516 --> 22:31.198
did. Now, I always understood that if a student was 
broke, Lupo would lend them money or would let them

22:32.900 --> 22:40.090
buy books on credit. Did any of your buddies 
ever... Not that I know of.

22:50.744 --> 22:55.170
When you were a student, what off-campus events do 
you remember? You remember hearing some

22:56.833 --> 23:00.898
important things happening... somewhere else 
that you heard on the radio or heard about? Well, I

23:04.932 --> 23:10.978
was in the Camp Bullish in San Antonio when the 
downed quintuplets were born. You

23:13.081 --> 23:23.512
know, I don't...

23:13.081 --> 23:23.512
That was after my junior year. And let's see, 
President Roosevelt was... in office during your

23:28.283 --> 23:31.787
student days, most of the time, wasn't he? Yeah, he 
was. And he had a son on the board of directors at

23:33.488 --> 23:39.134
A&M, Elliot. And Elliot got money to build 
dormitory rooms, and that's when they cut out the

23:39.154 --> 23:47.523
project houses. So he helped to get the money for 
the, what you and I call the new dorm area? Right.

23:53.268 --> 23:53.709
Really? That's right. There's no question. where 
did elliott live in those years fort worth as far as

23:57.005 --> 24:25.780
i know okay uh... and so it just happened that a 
democratic governor appointed uh... the son of

23:57.005 --> 24:25.780
the president that's right to the a m board board of 
regents did uh... at uh... final review and other

23:57.005 --> 24:25.780
things like that did uh... the board were they 
there as far as you knew i didn't know

24:27.143 --> 24:30.027
Did you and your buddies ever go into the steam 
tunnels?

24:32.912 --> 24:34.374
I didn't. No, I don't know of anybody else that did. 
Did you ever hear of the secret fraternities in

24:37.719 --> 24:44.870
those days, the secret Aggie fraternities? No, I 
did not know anything about it. But were you aware

24:47.354 --> 24:49.517
that they existed? Not really. What the student 
indulgence is at that time? Students drank beer.

24:59.596 --> 25:02.440
What were the most popular varieties of beer? How 
would I know if I never drank a bottle of beer? But

25:05.604 --> 25:07.165
you didn't hear him talk about it? Not any. What 
about smoking? Who smoked? Did the typical

25:13.153 --> 25:14.534
student smoke? Probably. And were they smoking 
cigarettes or cigars or pipes? They were smoking

25:22.644 --> 25:25.807
cigarettes, and most of us rolled our own. Bull 
Durham. Bull Durham? Yes, sir. And did you carry

25:31.092 --> 25:35.156
them in your shirt pocket? Probably.

25:38.699 --> 25:40.380
Where did the students smoke?

25:43.483 --> 25:44.384
In their rooms? Yeah, in their rooms. But never in 
class, never in the buildings. I don't know that

25:49.041 --> 25:50.684
for sure. I

25:52.326 --> 25:57.653
never saw any smoking in class. You said you never 
went to Hardlickers. Were there any other places

26:00.136 --> 26:06.224
that were kind of off limits for you and your 
friends? Not that I knew of. Let's see. On a home

26:10.549 --> 26:14.995
football day, describe... a home football 
Saturday. What time did y'all get up and what did

26:17.816 --> 26:20.480
you do? On

26:20.520 --> 26:35.743
the home football game when I was a student at A&M, 
I'd get up in the morning and work. At noon, I'd go

26:35.763 --> 26:41.992
over and wait for them to open the gate so I could get 
in free at Taft. I really did not buy. And I saw many

26:45.282 --> 26:55.514
A&M games when I was a faculty member because the 
Boy Scouts would serve as ushers. So the Boy

26:56.335 --> 27:02.762
Scouts, of course I bought season tickets for a 
while. I had an interesting experience. We'll

27:07.207 --> 27:12.152
leave at 11.30 to go eat.

27:12.173 --> 27:14.395
Gene Stallings was well known to me when he was a 
student. And when he was coach, he took two members

27:19.917 --> 27:28.670
of the faculty with him whenever he went to a ball 
game. And so he took me and an English teacher to LSU

27:30.072 --> 27:37.843
when they played LSU. And I enjoyed being with the 
team and so forth. When halftime came, we had

27:44.918 --> 27:50.710
sideline passes. When I said to Gene, well, you 
want me to go to the locker room with you? And he

27:55.641 --> 27:57.104
said, yes, I do. He said, when we puke, I want you to 
puke.

28:02.936 --> 28:05.762
Gene's wife taught in college. A&M the year before 
they were married. My daughter was in her Sunday

28:11.947 --> 28:17.352
school class, so we knew her real well. Fine 
people, fine people. You bet. Let's see. How did

28:23.657 --> 28:27.941
you and your buddies learn the Aggie yells and 
songs?

28:33.626 --> 28:35.968
I don't know that we all knew them. I guess

28:38.092 --> 28:52.369
I went to Yale practice after I lived in the 
dormitory, but I did not go until I lived one year in

28:38.092 --> 28:52.369
the dormitory. Let's see. Describe, as a student, 
describe a

28:54.352 --> 29:03.643
final review. Where was it held? What did you and 
your buddies? It was on the drill field in front of

29:07.347 --> 29:10.570
the Memorial Student Center. Now, wait a minute.

29:14.454 --> 29:18.999
I don't know when the Memorial Student Center was 
on that drill field anyway. Was that a serious

29:20.641 --> 29:23.163
event for you and your buddies?

29:27.488 --> 29:32.533
It wasn't for me.

29:33.998 --> 29:36.361
And then commencement. Where was commencement 
held? Oh, wait a minute. The awarding of degree,

29:42.729 --> 29:52.703
no, yeah, was held in the stadium on the south end. 
And I have no idea who the speaker was that day, but

29:54.405 --> 30:00.613
when he got up, he said, I want to congratulate the 
people of A&M, said, I've been standing here

30:01.471 --> 30:07.516
looking at the sun. And I was introduced just as the 
sun went down over that stadium wall.

30:16.524 --> 30:20.308
When you graduated, who came from your family? My 
mother. And she was the only one. My father's

30:25.152 --> 30:31.157
brother was buried the day I graduated from A&M, 
and my sister was a student in the TWU then. She

30:39.244 --> 30:43.388
couldn't.

30:43.508 --> 30:46.851
Do you remember going to silver taps as a student? 
Yeah, I do. Describe that. Well, the people would

30:49.094 --> 31:00.064
gather on the campus and it was a very solemn 
occasion and it was a silence that you could cut

31:00.533 --> 31:03.437
with a stick. And that was the whole thing, so far as 
I know. It was just playing of taps, and everybody

31:06.361 --> 31:12.769
gathered, and when the ceremony was over, they 
left. Did it touch your hearts?

31:20.039 --> 31:30.372
I really don't remember that it had much 
significance to me as a 17-year-old boy. But did

31:31.246 --> 31:34.169
you all ever act silly during Muster? Not that I 
know of. Nobody's ever indicated to me that they

31:36.412 --> 31:39.396
did. What about Muster? Do you remember going to 
Aggie Muster before World War II? I went to an Aggie

31:46.865 --> 31:49.628
Muster during World War II. But what about before? 
Well, now, look, I didn't go before. Well... I have

31:57.014 --> 32:04.703
the theory that World War II is really the birth of 
Aggie musters. That's right. You said you

32:06.285 --> 32:08.067
attended one during the war. Describe that, 
please. I got into O-RAN in North Africa sometime

32:10.630 --> 32:15.596
in the first part of April. Of 43? 44. Four, okay. 
And the...

32:26.815 --> 32:37.188
group that I was with was a special group, 250 field 
grade officers going to a specific mission. And we

32:37.208 --> 32:41.213
were there for about six weeks. And I heard about 
the Aggie Muster and I went to the Aggie Muster in

32:41.233 --> 32:52.087
O-Ran and at the same time they had the Muster on 
Corregidor. And I ran into a man not too long ago who

32:53.569 --> 32:56.653
was invited to come to A&M because he was in the 
Aggie Muster and O-Ran, and I hadn't been invited

32:57.089 --> 33:07.984
to A&M because I did. But I would have gone to the 
Aggie Muster in 45, had all my plans, but I was given

33:09.306 --> 33:17.477
orders to move out. And where I went, the muster was 
me. All right, this muster in Oran, how many people

33:23.137 --> 33:26.461
were there? About 20. And describe the content. 
What did you all do? Well, as far as I know, there

33:35.214 --> 33:39.881
wasn't much of a program. We just met and said, 
here's a muster. And I don't recall the... any part

33:47.123 --> 33:51.109
of it except I know I went. Do you remember any 
feelings you had? No, I don't have any feelings. I

33:56.857 --> 34:01.083
attended every muster when I was at A&M after I got 
home. I'm making, I believe, my 24th muster speech

34:01.423 --> 34:06.730
this spring. I'm doing the one in Albuquerque. I 
did Nashville, Tennessee last year. What was

34:12.993 --> 34:16.899
Aggie Bonfire like when you were a student? Trash. 
Did you help gather it? No, I didn't. Where was it

34:20.865 --> 34:21.826
held? On the drill field. And where'd that trash 
come from? Well, just wherever the Aggies could

34:27.675 --> 34:29.879
find it. And what did they put up on top of the 
bonfire? Well, they had the T.U. Dormitory up

34:36.288 --> 34:37.710
there. Where did they get those, those privies? As 
far as I know, they steal them wherever they can

34:42.355 --> 34:47.302
find them. Who came to the bonfire when it was 
ignited, when it burned? Who was there? It wasn't

34:53.430 --> 34:59.899
the same at all when I was a student.

35:04.204 --> 35:12.075
What are the experiences that build Aggie spirit 
and Aggie pride? Well,

35:14.333 --> 35:28.551
I don't really know, I must admit, the 
companionship of other people in a common

35:14.333 --> 35:28.551
endeavor, I guess. There's a statement that if you 
have it, you don't know where you got it, and if you

35:30.653 --> 35:39.324
don't have it, you can't understand it. So I I have 
that sort of feeling that

35:40.625 --> 35:52.600
I just have been acquainted with A&M so long. Is it 
partly that A&M is inclusive, that it doesn't

35:53.181 --> 36:05.878
matter whether you're rich or poor, whether 
you're from the country or the city, if you'll do

35:53.181 --> 36:05.878
your share, you're welcome? Is that part of it? 
Part of it. When you were a student, do you remember

36:09.076 --> 36:14.701
some poor boys and rich boys being friends?

36:17.744 --> 36:24.190
No, I don't really, because we were all poor boys in 
this project house, or we wouldn't have been

36:17.744 --> 36:24.190
there. And you know, the interesting thing to me is 
the fact that I started in 1968,

36:24.210 --> 36:38.003
maybe, going to the former students with these 
cards and pulling out the ones who graduated. And

36:47.290 --> 36:54.922
one of them was the man that the College of 
Engineering is named for. H.B. Zachary? No. Oh.

36:57.826 --> 36:58.407
Look. Oh, oh, oh, yeah, Dwight Look. Dwight Look. 
And some of the people in the project houses there

37:04.730 --> 37:13.479
sort of felt like that that he wasn't exactly uh...

37:13.499 --> 37:15.721
I don't know, it wasn't exactly uh... I don't know 
what to say. Did he live in a project house? Yes,

37:24.169 --> 37:24.870
sir. Where was he from? I have no idea. So he's a poor 
boy who made good financially. Yes, sir, but Let's

37:34.328 --> 37:35.209
keep it. Yeah.

37:40.074 --> 37:45.440
Talking about looking at what makes this Aggie 
feeling. You had some friends who were,

37:46.281 --> 37:54.110
there was a variety of where they came from. Right. 
A variety of where they worshipped. Right. Were

37:58.898 --> 38:02.282
there some Hispanic students at A&M when you were? 
Not any as far as I know. What about Jewish? They had

38:05.765 --> 38:06.506
a few. And were they accepted? I couldn't. There 
was a Jewish boy on the table that I waited on that I

38:13.433 --> 38:21.482
didn't see that there was any discrimination at 
all. What about, were there students from other

38:21.662 --> 38:24.405
countries?

38:27.348 --> 38:28.669
Maybe from Cuba. In Mexico, that's all I knew. And 
they were accepted? They were accepted. They were

38:34.873 --> 38:38.258
not discriminated against. And I'm guessing that 
during that period, one of the most common threads

38:39.260 --> 38:50.115
would have been that everybody was short on money. 
That's true. What are the qualities of being an

38:54.481 --> 38:57.205
Aggie? What is an Aggie? Since I'm not really a 
gung-ho

39:00.325 --> 39:08.373
Aggie, I don't really know how to answer that 
question. But you're a very proud Aggie. That's

39:11.497 --> 39:12.117
true. But in the meantime,

39:12.858 --> 39:25.251
what I have done, and I consider that I've had a 
fantastic life, I'll tell you that. had nothing to

39:25.940 --> 39:29.906
do with my student days at A&M. I just went to A&M and 
worked hard and got by. And when I graduated, I got a

39:40.103 --> 39:46.233
little tube, didn't have anything in it. I wasn't 
old enough to be an officer.

39:53.497 --> 40:08.913
And when I got my commission on my 21st birthday, I 
went to military camp for two weeks, and then I

39:53.497 --> 40:08.913
didn't have any further military experience 
until I was called into war. Your first job after

40:08.953 --> 40:11.856
graduation was what? Teaching. Where? St. 
Gabriel, Texas. How did you get that job? Well, the

40:19.324 --> 40:23.368
people would that needed an ag teacher would come 
to College Station and look at the resumes of all of

40:24.091 --> 40:34.124
the ag ed majors, and they'd pick out three. And 
when they picked out three, then they would

40:35.586 --> 40:42.215
arrange for us to come to be interviewed. And 10 
times I went,

40:43.577 --> 40:52.208
and Dick Burleson went, And somebody else went. 
And after five times of going, the students said,

40:56.616 --> 41:05.345
look, if you want a job, just go with Burleson and 
McNeil. Because I was 20 years old at the time and

41:06.346 --> 41:11.771
looked like I was going on 18. And there wasn't 
anybody that was going to hire an 18-year-old to

41:12.792 --> 41:19.138
teach vocational agriculture. And I got to San 
Gabriel.

41:23.238 --> 41:36.380
and I went back to A&M three weeks for a meets course 
so I could find out and the only lead they had was San

41:23.238 --> 41:36.380
Gabriel that I could go after I left finally. I went 
to San Gabriel and they said now look you can't have

41:37.001 --> 41:46.377
the job if Jamie Clark doesn't give it to you but you 
just as well visit some of the others and so When

41:46.677 --> 41:53.665
Jamie Clark came in and I said, look, Mr. Clark, I'm 
here to see about the job as ag teacher. And he said,

41:54.806 --> 41:56.248
you've got the job. Evidently, he may have talked 
to somebody else. But I said, well, what do you pay?

42:04.217 --> 42:06.980
I pay $90 a month. I said, look, he said, we pay our 
superintendent $125 a month. We're not going to

42:13.628 --> 42:16.431
pay the ag teacher more than the superintendent. 
And it took me two months to get him to get the board

42:17.423 --> 42:28.263
to give me expenses as well as my $90 a month. I got 
$75 for car expenses. And that's my first job. Now,

42:36.389 --> 42:38.532
San Gabriel is down south of? West of, it's in Milam 
County. Milam County. Between Cameron and

42:41.997 --> 42:44.621
Rockdale. About how big school was it then? Oh, 
they had 25 or 30. In the whole? In the whole school.

42:52.151 --> 42:52.933
In the whole school. And your duty was to teach 
what? Vocational agriculture half the time and

42:56.692 --> 43:05.905
teach some other class half of the time. How well 
prepared did you feel A&M had made you for that

43:06.866 --> 43:11.913
task?

43:15.638 --> 43:16.699
Not really. Is that right? That's right. What did 
you feel A&M had left out?

43:26.476 --> 43:40.533
Well,

43:26.476 --> 43:40.533
I didn't really get enough how

43:26.476 --> 43:40.533
to teach, enough experience. I had one day in an 
education class that I had that I went out to

43:40.553 --> 43:50.205
practice teach, and one day of something else. And 
so it was... as good as anybody else was doing in any

43:55.062 --> 44:02.833
school as far as I was concerned, but it wasn't that 
comprehensive. What time is it? We've got about,

44:04.415 --> 44:06.578
it's now 1120. Okay. And we're about through with 
this tape, so that'll break out even. As you look

44:12.526 --> 44:21.238
back, what effect has it had on your life that you 
went to Texas A&M?

44:24.475 --> 44:34.287
It just kept me from being a renter on a cotton farm 
at Moody.

44:37.150 --> 44:46.200
And some people that helped you get there and stay 
there must have earned gratitude from you. Who are

44:46.881 --> 44:51.246
those people that you now feel most grateful to? 
Well, both my daddy and mother. And I'm grateful to

44:54.412 --> 45:09.227
the

44:54.412 --> 45:09.227
faculty that permitted the beginning of the 
project houses. And as far as I'm concerned, the

45:10.288 --> 45:19.778
people that I dealt with in the project houses.

45:22.424 --> 45:25.688
What did you... Now, we're using the word learn in a 
very broad sense. What did you learn at A&M? Not

45:30.915 --> 45:36.802
book learning, but...

45:37.283 --> 45:39.105
I don't really know that I can answer that. You 
learned to continue working hard because you had

45:39.245 --> 45:43.991
to. That's right. And I learned to get along in my 
classwork. Mm-hmm. do my work, except at the

45:51.736 --> 45:56.260
English course that I ignored.

46:00.624 --> 46:04.628
What feelings do you hold in your heart now for 
Texas A&M? Well, I'll tell you. I'm very grateful

46:07.891 --> 46:16.298
to A&M because everything that I have been 
involved with includes A&M. I also feel like that

46:19.546 --> 46:38.155
A&M owes me more than I owe A&M in that I underwent 
bad treatment to get a degree from A&M.

46:38.275 --> 46:48.270
And I did a better job of their overseas mission 
than anybody that went into that group. I had

46:49.212 --> 46:57.962
contact with people of importance that I could 
sway in East Pakistan when I was there. And the head

46:59.104 --> 47:06.813
of the party would come to me and ask me to do this or 
that or the other instead of them doing that job.

47:06.833 --> 47:09.136
But I did a great job. My family and I did.
