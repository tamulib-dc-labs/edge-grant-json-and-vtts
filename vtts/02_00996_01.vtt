00:03.305 --> 00:11.196
This is an interview with Robert E. Kirk by George 
S. West on April 30, 1989, at Point Blank, Texas,

00:03.305 --> 00:11.196
concerning the Vietnam War. In the interest of 
accumulating knowledge about the war, I am going

00:11.977 --> 00:19.987
to donate this tape to the Texas A&M Oral History 
Collection and the University Archives. Is that

00:20.007 --> 00:20.848
all right with you? Yes, it is. Let's start with 
some background questions first, such as your

00:23.392 --> 00:26.936
date and place of birth. August 30, 1937, in 
Rensselaer, Indiana. What kind of education did

00:33.055 --> 00:35.897
you receive before entering the service? I 
completed my sophomore year in high school and

00:37.799 --> 00:44.065
then I quit high school and joined the Army. While I 
was in the Army, I finished my high school

00:45.086 --> 00:49.710
education in GED while I was in Germany.

00:53.033 --> 00:54.814
What did you do before Vietnam?

00:57.216 --> 01:01.560
Well, that would be a student and then I joined the 
Army I guess I'd been in the Army almost 10 years

01:02.333 --> 01:06.960
before I went to Vietnam.

01:11.386 --> 01:14.651
Did you know much about the war before you went to 
Vietnam? Just what I read in the newspapers and

01:15.692 --> 01:24.825
while I was in Germany I was in the intelligence 
section and we got periodic reports from Vietnam.

01:26.768 --> 01:27.870
But they were classified. Was any training you 
received useful? just my basic training.

01:38.908 --> 01:41.372
Why did you enlist in the service?

01:45.138 --> 01:48.103
I guess my basic reason was I just wanted to serve 
the country.

01:52.911 --> 01:54.173
When and where did you serve? I think it's pretty 
lengthy. I started out for my basic training Fort

02:00.856 --> 02:19.141
Leonard Wood, Missouri in 1954, and I went to 
Aberdeen, Maryland, and took my second English,

02:00.856 --> 02:19.141
the basic, which was in the Ordnance Corps, in 
ammunition, storage, handling, renovation, and

02:00.856 --> 02:19.141
EOD work. Upon completion of basic training, I 
went to Germany, wound up in the Monterey

02:19.161 --> 02:29.175
Battalion as an ammo specialist, And within a 
year, I decided to become a mechanic. I went to

02:34.126 --> 02:41.493
mechanic school and continued being a mechanic 
for the next four years. Then I got out of the Army

02:42.474 --> 02:45.798
briefly in 1958. Stayed out 11 months. While I was 
out, I worked as a mechanic. Then I went back in the

02:51.383 --> 02:55.527
military and into the Military Police Corps. Went 
to military police school in Fort Fort Gordon,

02:59.412 --> 03:01.014
Georgia. Upon completion of military police 
school, I was reassigned to Korea, the 7th

03:01.915 --> 03:11.108
Infantry Division, and Camp Kaiser. I stayed 
there three years, and two and a half years of that

03:11.128 --> 03:17.677
three years, I was a military police 
investigator. Upon completion of my Korean tour,

03:19.199 --> 03:27.090
I was reassigned to Fort Chaffee, Arkansas, at the 
66th Military Police Company. And through the

03:31.609 --> 03:37.355
course of commotions and whatnot, they had to 
change my MLS to infantry. So I was reassigned to a

03:38.436 --> 03:45.603
45th Infantry Battalion in Fort Chappie. 
However, we only were activated three months

03:45.623 --> 03:50.828
before they closed Fort Chappie. Then I was 
reassigned to Fort Benning to the Ranger

03:52.029 --> 03:57.735
Department as an instructor. Stayed there about 
eight months, I believe, and then I was reassigned

03:59.960 --> 04:04.404
back to Germany. Wound up in a tank battalion, the 
2nd Battalion, 68th Armored, in Baumholder,

04:05.645 --> 04:12.892
Germany. That was supposed to have been a 
three-year tour, but I was curtailed from that

04:12.912 --> 04:29.427
assignment three months early to come back to Fort 
Riley, Kansas, to activate the 9th Infantry

04:12.912 --> 04:29.427
Division and go to Vietnam. So approximately 
eight or nine months after I was in Fort Plough, we

04:31.364 --> 04:42.835
packed up as an entire division and went to 
Vietnam. Took us about 27 days to get there by ship.

04:48.781 --> 04:58.910
And I spent a year in Vietnam, and I came back to the 
States, Fort Polk, Louisiana, to training units.

04:58.930 --> 05:00.612
Stayed in the States one year. Back to Vietnam for 
another year. Back to Fort Polk

05:05.673 --> 05:14.085
for nearly 18 months, I believe. Then I went back to 
Korea again. Stayed in Korea a year again. Back to

05:21.496 --> 05:27.004
the States, to Fort Polk a third time, to 55th and 
1st and Old Trent Police Company. Stayed there

05:27.846 --> 05:30.109
until I retired. in August of 1975.

05:40.138 --> 05:45.924
What were, what was your rank and what were your 
duties in Vietnam? My first time in Vietnam I was a

05:45.944 --> 05:56.294
sergeant first class, platoon sergeant, and of 
course as that rank I was a platoon sergeant. But

05:56.314 --> 05:59.758
after our first engagement with the enemy I became 
a platoon leader, and for the next 11 months I

06:00.194 --> 06:07.745
worked as a platoon leader, which is normal rank as 
a lieutenant. The second time in Vietnam, I went

06:09.007 --> 06:22.968
over, my rank was first sergeant, but my duty 
assignment was sergeant major in the 24th Spatial

06:09.007 --> 06:22.968
Tactical Zone, which is a Vietnamese unit under 
MACV.

06:27.054 --> 06:29.037
What was everyday life like? Well, everyday life 
was pretty miserable. We were in the boondocks

06:36.442 --> 06:40.226
more than we were anywhere else. And we were always 
hot, wet, and muddy. We very rarely saw any dry

06:45.692 --> 06:47.715
land. We were always in the rice paddies. If we saw 
one that was dry, we thought we were in heaven.

06:58.466 --> 07:00.829
How did you and your unit try to fight the war? Well, 
we tried to fight war as if you're normally

07:02.547 --> 07:06.893
trained. I mean, we know what our function is, and 
we go out on our missions. We try to conduct it the

07:14.964 --> 07:18.349
way we knew it was supposed to be conducted.

07:21.734 --> 07:30.546
There were times they sent us out, and they sent us 
to a so-called free-fire zone that anything that

07:21.734 --> 07:30.546
moves, you shoot at. And there's other times they 
tell you, well, this is a no-fire zone, meaning

07:31.572 --> 07:40.382
that if you receive fire, you can't return fire. To 
me, that's not the way to fight a war. And you can't

07:43.946 --> 07:45.868
see the enemy. They see you, and they know the 
terrain, and we don't.

07:53.757 --> 07:55.639
I don't think we were allowed to fight the war.

08:00.563 --> 08:03.527
What kind of operations were you involved in? Were 
they mainly successes or failures?

08:08.953 --> 08:10.535
Well, that's a difficult question. We were foot 
infantry. We didn't have any vehicles. And we were

08:15.421 --> 08:19.105
attached to the Navy and we were rivering force. So 
the Navy pretty much took us where we were going and

08:19.145 --> 08:25.193
eventually picked us up and brought us back. But if 
we couldn't go by water, we could go by air

08:25.213 --> 08:28.917
helicopter. And if we couldn't go those two ways, 
we just walked. We went on all kinds of combat

08:33.362 --> 08:36.106
operations. We searched and destroyed

08:36.126 --> 08:41.354
routine patrol. We were searching out for the 
enemy. Maybe we find them, maybe we don't. More

08:45.720 --> 08:46.881
often than not, we didn't. And we'd be used as 
blocking forces for another unit that was making a

08:48.303 --> 08:54.853
sweep somewhere. As far as success, I don't know 
how you would measure success. When we engage the

09:01.982 --> 09:07.950
enemy, we always seem to inflict more damage to 
them than they did us. Those times we could find

09:09.412 --> 09:20.586
evidence after the battle, but more often than 
not, after the battle, you search the area, we

09:09.412 --> 09:20.586
couldn't find any of them. We'd find blood, but we 
didn't find any bodies for the most part. So, as far

09:25.152 --> 09:27.675
as being successful, I wouldn't really have any 
idea.

09:32.967 --> 09:37.272
Are there any specific missions that you remember 
that stand out in your mind? Oh yes, there's a

09:37.292 --> 09:39.134
couple that stand out in my mind. I don't remember 
the exact dates and some of the places, but there

09:39.154 --> 09:57.595
was in the Canaan area that was pretty well 
infested with a combination of VC and VA. Any time

09:39.154 --> 09:57.595
we went up in there, we wound up against the a pretty 
large force. Fortunately for us, our force was

10:00.021 --> 10:02.765
always larger than theirs.

10:06.570 --> 10:11.616
We'd take a few cagulets, but like I say, very 
rarely did we find the enemy bodies. And then there

10:12.417 --> 10:25.093
were some times we'd go through the rice paddies, 
and it may be knee-deep in water, and we'd stumble

10:12.417 --> 10:25.093
sometimes, and all of a sudden some bodies would 
float to the top. But we thought most of those were

10:28.186 --> 10:34.792
killed by either artillery fire or B-52 strike 
that just happened to fly away. I don't think we, as

10:34.853 --> 10:39.897
such, inflicted the casualties. We just happened 
to stumble across them. But then there was one

10:43.621 --> 10:57.855
major battle where we were fighting, I think it was 
264th

10:43.621 --> 10:57.855
VC Regiment, and I believe it was in May of 67, where 
when we finally swept the area, we found it. And

11:03.011 --> 11:10.040
whatever position they happened to be in when they 
crawled in the bunkers, that's how we found them.

11:10.060 --> 11:14.525
But there was also a combination of B-52 Arclight 
the night before we went in. The Arclight probably

11:15.867 --> 11:18.690
created the most casualties. But a few weeks later 
we captured a courier that had some documents on to

11:25.375 --> 11:41.619
him from the commander of that unit, explaining 
that they'd practically been wiped out, that they

11:25.375 --> 11:41.619
didn't even have enough people to think about 
reorganizing,

11:25.375 --> 11:41.619
and he needed immediate replacements. Well, that 
was approximately May. The following September,

11:46.787 --> 11:53.897
December the 17th, exactly, we were sent on a 
mission somewhere in the central delta area we

11:54.350 --> 12:23.800
were going by by boat and we were supposed to go to 
this location and find a large cache of enemy

11:54.350 --> 12:23.800
weapons and we were supposed to beach at 7 30 in the 
morning and make a sweep approximately 8 000

11:54.350 --> 12:23.800
meters north and we were found However, 7 o'clock 
that morning, we ran through an ambush from both

12:24.792 --> 12:31.880
sides of the river. And there was some pretty heavy 
fighting on that one. My platoon was the lead boat.

12:40.550 --> 12:42.392
The CO happened to be on the boat with me. And we went 
through the ambush site and made it to our beaching

12:42.413 --> 12:49.921
site and went ashore. Though we didn't get more 
than 200 yards inside, we couldn't advance any

12:49.941 --> 12:54.006
more. back to both my point and pinned down and 
wounded. And the battalion commander was

12:59.870 --> 13:03.715
upstairs in the helicopter and he could see what 
was going on. And he told us to get back on our boat

13:04.936 --> 13:09.542
and rejoin the battalion. It seems the rest of the 
boats, when we hit that ambush, they backed up and

13:09.562 --> 13:19.875
beached a safe distance from the ambush site. So we 
finally got back on our boats Went back through

13:24.884 --> 13:26.706
that ambush again. Didn't take any more 
casualties at that time. And we rejoined the

13:31.052 --> 13:39.562
battalion a couple miles upstream and started 
evacuating the wounded. That day we had 101

13:39.863 --> 13:46.871
casualties, 99 wounded and two killed. One 
soldier and one sailor were killed, and then the

13:48.453 --> 13:53.760
wounded was a combination of both. Each one of our 
boats had, I believe it was eight sails on it, and

13:55.327 --> 14:00.892
the rest of us were on it. After we evacuated all our 
wounded, we went back through that ambush again.

14:12.984 --> 14:17.728
But this time, we just met sporadic fire in the 
ambush site. The enemy had used that time interval

14:18.629 --> 14:23.494
to withdraw somewhat. But it still took us 
approximately eight hours to go a couple thousand

14:24.892 --> 14:31.962
meters for the sporadic fire. We never did find a 
body. And we did not find a weapons cache. Which

14:38.030 --> 14:47.082
leads me to believe that the information that the 
intelligence was working on initially was

14:38.030 --> 14:47.082
planted information that they knew we were 
coming. But they ambushed us 30 minutes before we

14:48.764 --> 14:52.409
were to land it. Fortunately for us, our boats were 
on the plane.

14:57.916 --> 14:59.158
Then there was another one.

15:02.402 --> 15:12.276
I don't remember if it was October or November 67.

15:12.296 --> 15:13.137
Somewhere in the Delta.

15:16.321 --> 15:19.085
We were already on an operation. We didn't find 
anything. And then the CO received a radio

15:22.209 --> 15:27.737
transmission to pack up and move about 10 clicks 
off to the west with a separate mission. Well, the

15:35.384 --> 15:40.431
choppers came in and we only had enough choppers to 
take two platoons. So the first and third platoon

15:40.451 --> 15:44.476
left and the CO went with them. And before he left, 
he told me, well, the choppers will come back and

15:45.938 --> 15:52.846
get us. But if they're not back within 30 minutes 
for us to walk over to where they were. so that while

15:59.105 --> 16:15.080
they're gone, I look among them and I pick out a 
route to get there the quickest and easiest, just

15:59.105 --> 16:15.080
in case those choppers didn't come back.

16:15.100 --> 16:27.492
The distance from where I was to where the SEAL and 
the rest of the company eventually lined up was out

16:15.100 --> 16:27.492
of our radio limitation, so I couldn't hear what 
was going on over there. and it but i did find out

16:28.973 --> 16:56.837
over the radio that our choppers was diverted to 
another operation so we were about to saddle up and

16:28.973 --> 16:56.837
move out to marry up with the rest of the company

16:28.973 --> 16:56.837
and all of a sudden some more choppers came in from 
some place i don't know who they belong to but it was

16:28.973 --> 16:56.837
obvious they were us because they landed and 
picked us up and took us

17:02.032 --> 17:08.479
As we're coming in, all hell broke loose, and there 
was bullets flying everywhere, and we're still in

17:02.032 --> 17:08.479
the air. And as we're coming down, my lead 
helicopter was hit and crashed into the ground.

17:19.432 --> 17:22.836
Intact, fortunately, with everybody on it. I was 
in the second chopper. And we dived out of those

17:27.441 --> 17:29.423
helicopters, I happened to land right near the CO, 
and he was telling me that he was trying to wave us

17:31.394 --> 17:36.342
off. We were too busy to notice him. Didn't see him 
trying to wave us off. We did not know there was a hot

17:41.590 --> 17:45.976
LZ.

17:47.118 --> 17:55.651
And because of all this firing going on, pretty 
well occupied, so I didn't really know what was

17:47.118 --> 17:55.651
going on around. And all these helicopters taking 
back off,

18:02.815 --> 18:13.105
Out of the clear blue sky come a medivac helicopter 
and managed to get all the casualties off that

18:02.815 --> 18:13.105
first helicopter. But I thought, sure, he was 
going to crash into the helicopter because all of

18:13.125 --> 18:22.775
them trying to rise and he's down there and then 
he's trying to rise and he was losing control. But

18:22.915 --> 18:27.800
he managed to maintain control of that medivac and 
got out of there safely. And the SEAL got his tail

18:27.820 --> 18:30.983
member because we hadn't even called in the 
medivac. And he got his tail number so we could

18:32.633 --> 18:36.297
eventually find out who he was. And we eventually 
got that chopper pilot's distinguished line

18:36.998 --> 18:41.824
across. Well, after the choppers were all gone, of 
course, we still got that disabled chopper there.

18:49.473 --> 18:51.996
And the SEAL was explaining to me what we got. Well, 
we called in some helicopter gunships, and

18:53.578 --> 19:00.987
eventually the Air Force came in and give us some 
supporting fire. And the helicopter pilot was

19:05.290 --> 19:12.902
telling us we were in a horseshoe ambush and told us 
the limits of it. And he was telling us about all the

19:15.546 --> 19:21.154
bodies that they could see laying around there. 
Now the CO wanted me to send a patrol off to within my

19:21.174 --> 19:32.290
right flank forward, skirting the ambush to see 
what we could do about trying to outflank them. So I

19:34.396 --> 19:46.957
sent one of my squads, one of my best squad leaders, 
out to plank that ambush and see what we could do,

19:34.396 --> 19:46.957
but they didn't get very far before they told us 
that they couldn't go any further. So the SEAL told

19:46.977 --> 19:49.201
me to bring them back. I brought them back. While 
all this was going on, there was this huge tree in

19:51.205 --> 19:59.138
front of us, and the SEAL already figured out there 
was a machine gun in placement at the base of that

19:59.843 --> 20:06.530
tree that had gotten five men out of the first team. 
And I don't know why, but I was looking at the top of

20:06.550 --> 20:15.840
that tree, and I saw two black objects.

20:15.860 --> 20:17.582
But I didn't know what they were. But one of them 
appeared to be moving, getting higher. And then he

20:23.749 --> 20:27.353
comes back, a little bit closer to that other one. 
And at first I thought it was just my eyes playing

20:28.497 --> 20:36.228
tricks on me, but I was certain that it was moving. 
So I asked the CO what to say. He said, look up there

20:38.231 --> 20:41.515
in that tree and tell me if one of those black blobs 
isn't moving. And he looked up there and he, by the

20:43.338 --> 20:45.781
way, the owner. So I pointed my rifle up there and I 
pulled off around. It was obvious that that M16 was

20:51.669 --> 20:56.276
ineffective. We're up there. too far away, and all 
the brush in the tree. So I went over to that downed

21:04.186 --> 21:18.647
helicopter, because I know there's two machine 
guns there, and I was debating whether to get in

21:04.186 --> 21:18.647
behind that one machine gun and fire at that thing 
in the tree. And I got to think, well, no. The grass

21:22.953 --> 21:25.977
is high enough around here, the other can't see me. 
But they could damn sure see that helicopter. And

21:29.834 --> 21:33.139
they knew where those machine guns were on that 
chopper. Had to commit suicide to get behind that

21:33.159 --> 21:35.382
gun. But I saw that M14 strapped to the pilot's 
seat. It had two magazines in it, taped together.

21:45.916 --> 21:48.780
So I took the M14 out, and it was filthy. I couldn't 
get the bolt open. I had to put it on the ground and

21:51.163 --> 21:54.748
open it with my foot. And I went back with the tail 
boom of the helicopter, and I laid my rifle over the

21:56.315 --> 22:01.621
tail boom. But that first round wouldn't go off. So 
I ejected that, put a second round in the chamber.

22:10.812 --> 22:16.820
And I fired at that blob that I saw moving, but I 
missed. So I fired the second round. And all of a

22:19.062 --> 22:24.429
sudden, here comes this bird flying out of the 
ground, out of the tree, landing on the ground on

22:19.062 --> 22:24.429
his head. It was an enemy soldier. About that time, 
all kinds of bullets started hitting the tail boom

22:27.820 --> 22:33.906
of that helicopter. I decided that's not the place 
to be. And as I'm about to move out, I heard somebody

22:36.909 --> 22:40.873
holler. And it was one of our men from the 3rd 
platoon. He was a little ways in front of that

22:43.075 --> 22:45.217
helicopter. And I hollered at him to find out where 
he was, and he told me he was wounded. So I kind of

22:53.245 --> 22:57.709
crawled over to where he was and helped him back 
over to the company headquarters. And then the CO

23:01.741 --> 23:04.265
decided to call artillery in. And he gave the 
artillery people their accordance, told them how

23:06.107 --> 23:13.958
far ahead to fire the rounds. And artillery 
brought in some smoke. And by the time they

23:18.344 --> 23:21.768
finished, there was no tree standing there. Just a 
stump and a bunch of brush around. And it was

23:25.794 --> 23:26.835
getting dark. So we were told we had to stay and 
guard that helicopter. So we set up a perimeter

23:33.341 --> 23:37.064
defense. In the process of setting up a perimeter 
defense, that's when I realized I only had about

23:37.084 --> 23:41.769
half of my people.

23:44.491 --> 23:47.854
And we started looking around for the other half. 
Both my machine gun crews were gone. And because it

23:51.577 --> 23:56.822
was getting dark, I suggested to the CO We don't 
search for them anymore. Because everybody will

23:59.920 --> 24:01.642
be scared. And there's no shooter or anything that 
moves. So wherever they are, we just leave them

24:05.368 --> 24:08.532
there. And in the morning, we'll go out where 
people can see each other and we'll start

24:09.634 --> 24:14.841
searching for them. He agreed with me. But I 
assumed they were on the ground somewhere.

24:23.534 --> 24:24.295
The next morning, We start popping our heads up 
above the dikes. We're not receiving any fire. So

24:30.929 --> 24:33.432
we assume the enemy had withdrawn. So the SEAL 
calls that brigade to get a Chinook to come in and

24:35.675 --> 24:42.104
pull that helicopter out. And we start searching 
for my missing troops. And we didn't find

24:46.490 --> 24:50.435
them. So he called base camp. And sure enough, they 
were all back at base camp. It seemed that the last

24:55.971 --> 25:04.003
three choppers in my group that brought us in 
couldn't get close enough to the ground to

24:55.971 --> 25:04.003
disgorge my troops. And some of them became 
casualties, too, while they were still in the air.

25:10.753 --> 25:16.621
So, I don't have any machine guns, and I only have 
half my platoon. And we've got to carry on with the

25:18.003 --> 25:19.746
mission. So I went up to that helicopter before the 
Chinook got there, and I took the two machine guns

25:20.890 --> 25:26.635
off of it. Unfortunately, the gunners had left the 
bipods on them. Half of them take the bipods off.

25:33.462 --> 25:42.210
And when the Chinook came in, I told the crew chief 
to let the commander of that helicopter know that I

25:33.462 --> 25:42.210
have the weapons off that chopper. And when we 
finish with this mission and get back to base camp,

25:43.051 --> 25:48.856
we'll see if they get the weapons back. But I need 
the weapons. So

25:51.653 --> 26:02.729
after they took the Huey off, they wanted a body 
count of the enemy's casualties. So we started

26:02.789 --> 26:08.338
searching the area for enemy casualties. Now we 
already know what the gunship pilot was telling us

26:08.358 --> 26:13.705
about bodies laying everywhere. And the CO and I 
both saw that clown come flying out of that tree.

26:21.472 --> 26:26.597
But of course, he's probably buried underneath 
all that bush, and we're not about to pull it up and

26:21.472 --> 26:26.597
look for one stupid body. But in the process of 
searching for bodies, we did not find one.

26:34.805 --> 26:42.954
And I think we had nine

26:34.805 --> 26:42.954
or ten killed, and I don't remember how many 
wounded.

26:46.097 --> 26:49.420
And we did not find one single body. And Brigade 
called the SEAL and wanted a body count. He told me,

26:55.041 --> 26:56.483
he said, I can't find him. He said, you better come 
up with a body count. So the SEAL and I, we were

27:02.930 --> 27:06.514
pretty close. And she said, well, what do you 
think, Bob? I said, well, those cops were telling

27:10.238 --> 27:13.181
me that the body's all over the place. I think it'd 
be safe to say we got 10. We know we lost 10. He said,

27:22.036 --> 27:23.698
that sounds like a good figure. So he told them ten. 
And they come on the air and they chewed him out.

27:31.805 --> 27:37.091
With all that ordnance you've expended out there, 
you can only come up with ten, you better come up

27:31.805 --> 27:37.091
with a better figure. The SEAL refused to raise the 
figure. Well, when they finally wrote up the

27:44.678 --> 27:51.925
operation, they put something like a hundred and a 
hundred and some enemy casualties, and we didn't

27:52.563 --> 27:57.088
even find one. I don't believe any figures from 
Vietnam are friendly or enemy. In fact, in my

28:03.855 --> 28:15.827
personal opinion, if you tallied up all the 
casualties we were supposed to have inflicted on

28:03.855 --> 28:15.827
the enemy in the early 60s, I'd like to know who in 
the world we were fighting.

28:19.011 --> 28:21.253
I think we should have wiped out the whole male 
population.

28:24.727 --> 28:31.654
And there were several other battles, but they 
didn't really amount to nothing.

28:31.674 --> 28:37.280
We got a bunch of unit declarations for our 
operations. I think that's so much junk

28:37.300 --> 28:43.106
to sell. Did you see many changes during your tours 
regarding the missions? Regarding what missions

28:48.271 --> 28:51.074
you were sent on? The missions you were sent on, 
such as more search and destroy? Well, we were sent

28:54.292 --> 28:59.879
on probably more search and destroys than 
anything else. Well, there was a couple times we'd

28:59.979 --> 29:08.288
be on search and destroy and we'd find evidence of 
enemy activity. Like we'd find some places where

29:09.670 --> 29:15.917
they were scrounging up C-ration cans and there 
was all kinds of shrapnel around. It was obvious

29:15.977 --> 29:20.583
that they were making movie traps out of old 
C-ration cans. In fact, a couple of my people lost a

29:22.777 --> 29:26.201
foot or something to a sea ration can of peaches. 
And when we find stuff like that, we destroyed the

29:27.583 --> 29:34.352
dwelling that all that stuff was in. One time, we 
set fire to a couple of haystacks because they were

29:36.194 --> 29:48.509
in our way for

29:36.194 --> 29:48.509
an operation. And it was getting dark. Those 
haystacks, they were lighting up the area pretty

29:53.489 --> 29:55.692
well. We could see what was going on out there. But 
all of a sudden, there was an explosion. Of course,

29:59.558 --> 30:01.060
that alerted everybody. We started looking at 
where the hell that explosion was coming from. And

30:04.425 --> 30:08.091
all of a sudden, two of those haystacks started 
blowing up. They kept blowing up all night long.

30:10.995 --> 30:15.421
There was all kinds of ammunition stored in those 
haystacks. And then there was some other times

30:15.441 --> 30:19.868
that They sent us on a search and destroy mission, 
and they told us to destroy anything we came upon.

30:26.831 --> 30:31.176
And when we come upon them, a series of weapons, we 
destroy them. That's what our orders were. And

30:33.378 --> 30:40.965
those orders originally supposedly came from the 
Vietnamese government, that anybody in that area

30:33.378 --> 30:40.965
is enemy or enemy sympathizer.

30:45.189 --> 30:48.032
There was one village We'd come in through, not on a 
search and destroy operation. We were there to

30:53.687 --> 31:04.137
guard that village so that they could safely vote 
without any interference from any enemy

30:53.687 --> 31:04.137
antagonists. And it was daytime, so I gave my 
people 75% off and 25% alert. We didn't expect

31:13.446 --> 31:16.129
anything to happen during the daytime. And I was 
half asleep, and I heard some yelling. It sounded

31:23.390 --> 31:24.852
like a little kid hollering. So I go to where I hear 
the noise coming from, and there's a couple of my

31:26.295 --> 31:36.850
troops standing there, and they've got this 
little kid by his feet, upside down, dunking him in

31:26.295 --> 31:36.850
this big old pond. I walk up there, and I make them 
stop, and what the hell do you think you're doing?

31:43.339 --> 31:45.863
Then they told me that he stole seven grenades, He 
got caught in the act of stealing the last one. Then

31:51.523 --> 31:54.186
I said, well, carry on until we find those 
grenades. So eventually, he showed us where the

31:55.787 --> 32:01.353
grenades were stashed. And of course, we kept him 
in prison for the remainder of the day and night. We

32:05.157 --> 32:09.101
wanted to turn him over to the White Mice National 
Police the next day. And he couldn't have been more

32:09.922 --> 32:13.926
than eight or nine. But they can kill you just as 
well as a grown man can. But I had a couple of

32:20.377 --> 32:27.966
engineers, mine sweeping team, that we didn't 
need. And I assigned them to keep an eye on this

32:27.986 --> 32:31.730
little kid. I should have assigned one of my own 
troops, but I assigned those people. And early in

32:37.637 --> 32:41.702
the morning, that little kid escaped. And I'll 
tell you, you never saw anybody run so fast across

32:41.722 --> 32:45.246
those rice paddies. He got away. But he was only 
somewhere between seven and nine years old. And we

32:54.180 --> 33:02.392
ran into a couple of females

32:54.180 --> 33:02.392
that just as soon as you shoot you, they look at you. 
We wound up having to kill two of them.

33:09.082 --> 33:13.108
We had white mice with us on a couple of operations. 
We stumbled over ten enemy that was hidden in a hole

33:15.112 --> 33:20.657
underneath a piece of sheet steel. And they 
finally got unnerved, I guess, and took off. And we

33:24.781 --> 33:27.264
caught them. And these white mice, each one on that 
Thompson .45 submachine gun, I thought they were

33:27.284 --> 33:34.230
going to blow all of them away. And they had them 
laying flat on the ground in the barrel of that

33:35.472 --> 33:43.279
submachine gun, sticking right in its forehead, 
jabbering their gibberish. I don't know what all

33:44.980 --> 33:50.686
that enemy crew told him, but I mean to tell you, he 
was doing some talking. Probably told them a lot

33:50.706 --> 33:54.830
more than what they really asked for. And I 
expected them to blow them away anyhow. To my

33:57.232 --> 33:59.774
knowledge, they evacuated the rear after that. I 
don't know what happened

33:59.794 --> 34:04.839
to them. Did you notice any changes of troop 
morale? No. My first time over there, we had pretty

34:14.292 --> 34:39.996
good morale although there was times we wondered 
what in the world we're doing here i mean they send

34:14.292 --> 34:39.996
us out and won't let us do anything or well we go out 
there and we walk and walk and walk and walk and jump

34:14.292 --> 34:39.996
to see a cotton picking vine and

34:14.292 --> 34:39.996
it got kind of frustrating we thought we were there 
to fight a war but we didn't really have that much

34:41.461 --> 34:42.862
actual combat going on. We'd be out there maybe two 
weeks and not see or hear a cotton picket sign. Then

34:48.428 --> 34:51.651
another time he'd go out and all hell breaks loose. 
But for the most part, our troops' morale was good.

34:56.115 --> 35:05.684
And my second time, my participation was not so 
much involved in combat as it was in combat

34:56.115 --> 35:05.684
support. We were the MACV and we had so many 
subordinate units assigned to us I just went from

35:12.595 --> 35:18.022
unit to unit checking on their condition and their 
morale and whatnot. The second time I had one

35:19.304 --> 35:26.213
sergeant first class, he was an advisor to the 42nd 
Arvin Regiment.

35:28.956 --> 35:35.385
That particular regiment was one of the sorriest

35:28.956 --> 35:35.385
that I'd ever known about. I mean, they'd walk 30 
miles to avoid engaging with the enemy. Sergeant

35:43.072 --> 35:47.516
Wall was sped up with it and wanted out. He didn't 
want to go back to an American unit or someplace,

35:48.878 --> 35:55.524
but he wanted out of that unit. And the lieutenant 
colonel, who was his team commander, didn't

35:55.544 --> 36:05.834
appreciate that and wanted to reduce him for 
insubordination. So my duty position is sergeant

36:05.854 --> 36:12.420
major, and I'm responsible to all who are enlisted 
personnel. So I had Sergeant Wall report to us, and

36:14.020 --> 36:22.908
I talked to him for a couple hours, and he explained 
to me his situation.

36:25.210 --> 36:26.691
And I agreed with him wholeheartedly. So I got with 
Colonel Miller, who was our zone commander, the

36:28.132 --> 36:42.525
position was that of a brigadier general, and I 
suggested that we pull Sergeant Wall out of the

36:28.132 --> 36:42.525
team and reassign him to 2 Corps somewhere in the 
G-3 section, G-2 or G-3 section, that he'd be more

36:43.349 --> 36:49.555
beneficial back there. He will be totally 
ineffective in the 42nd Regiment because he has no

36:49.655 --> 36:56.301
respect for them. I have no respect for them. You 
have no respect for them. We'll send a new NCO up

36:59.925 --> 37:03.268
there. And he agreed with me, so Sergeant Waller 
was reassigned to 2 Corps Headquarters for

37:03.288 --> 37:11.095
General Timothy. and we put another unit another 
sergeant in the 42nd regiment but

37:12.661 --> 37:39.394
our opinion of the urban troops is they didn't want 
to fight any more than anybody else did for example

37:12.661 --> 37:39.394
we we knew the tunarong valley was infested with 
the nba and we kept trying to get the vietnamese

37:12.661 --> 37:39.394
commander to commit operations to the Tumarong 
Valley to engage in an attempt to destroy the

37:39.577 --> 37:45.743
enemy. And they kept coming up with other ideas and 
whatnot. They didn't want to go to the Tumarong

37:50.467 --> 37:55.031
Valley.

37:55.051 --> 38:02.498
And I don't remember the dates, but I remember 
Colonel Miller had 45 days left in the country. And

38:03.919 --> 38:08.183
we finally got him to go en masse to the Tumarong 
Valley. We took them in by helicopter, dropped

38:09.192 --> 38:16.160
them on this mountaintop, and they put up wire and 
everything. They were running patrols off this

38:16.781 --> 38:21.847
mountaintop.

38:21.867 --> 38:25.711
After the third day, they came under a heavy 
attack. And the enemy got all the way up to the wire,

38:26.833 --> 38:29.956
got hung up in the wire. And they even had some 
hand-to-hand fighting.

38:36.004 --> 38:37.225
So the next day, The Vietnamese colonel and his 
entourage, he never went anywhere without half a

38:38.150 --> 38:43.797
dozen people with him. Bodyguard and half his 
staff. My colonel and me, we get on a Huey and we go to

38:47.562 --> 39:01.080
the mountain top to see what's going on and get some 
kind of command structure. We land and we can see

39:01.100 --> 39:06.908
the enemy laying all over the place. But the Arbors 
did take a heavy toll of casualties on their own.

39:15.252 --> 39:18.978
And the Vietnamese colonel decided he had to 
withdraw his troops. So we started calling the

39:20.941 --> 39:29.674
Hueys in to withdraw the Arbors. Well, as the Hueys 
were coming in, they'd come under intense fire

39:29.694 --> 39:35.022
again. abandoned the use of Hueys and went to 
Chinooks. But if they lose a helicopter, it's best

39:39.031 --> 39:44.536
to lose one Chinook rather than a couple of Hueys. 
Even though we've got a greater amount of Cagulis,

39:46.859 --> 39:51.423
they switch from Hueys to Chinooks. But in the 
process, they had this prisoner who convinced the

39:51.543 --> 40:02.815
Arvin commander that he was going to show them 
where the the command base was for the enemy

40:03.115 --> 40:05.358
troops. Well, our chopper was already overloaded 
because of this entourage that we had to meet the

40:07.561 --> 40:13.710
colonel. So my colonel told me to stay on the 
mountain until they come back. And they put that

40:20.019 --> 40:21.821
prisoner in that place.

40:24.585 --> 40:30.213
That helicopter didn't get 500 yards from that 
mountaintop when it was shot down. Of course,

40:30.834 --> 40:32.937
everybody on it was killed.

40:36.224 --> 40:41.011
And so I got on another helicopter and went out with 
them to come back to base. But here we got, it took us

40:43.054 --> 40:51.948
all that time to get those Vietnamese into that 
area, knowing that the enemy is there. We're

40:51.968 --> 40:52.749
soldiers. Our sole function on Earth is to fight 
when the time comes. But when the time came, they

40:58.698 --> 41:02.163
wanted to get the hell out. To me, that's 
cowardice. And I have no respect for the

41:06.245 --> 41:16.117
Vietnamese military from the command structure 
on down, beginning with the command structure. In

41:16.137 --> 41:26.890
fact, one time, my first time, we were on a patrol 
operation, and then I got a call from my CO. He was

41:26.910 --> 41:28.271
still back in base camp. It was just my platoon out 
there in the boondocks. And he told me to switch

41:32.477 --> 41:36.201
radio frequencies and report to Brigade 
headquarters. I was going to be under their

41:37.746 --> 41:39.928
command for a while. So I switched frequencies and 
contacted Brigade and they gave me a destination

41:41.129 --> 41:50.677
somewhere to the north of us. And it was a village, a 
small village. And he told me to go up to that

41:56.042 --> 42:04.990
village and there would be an American colonel 
that I was to report to and he would give me my

41:56.042 --> 42:04.990
instructions. So, and I was to stay with them until 
that colonel released me, and then I'd come back to

42:07.079 --> 42:16.189
base camp. So we go up there. It took us something 
like seven hours to get there. And I report to that

42:23.257 --> 42:27.322
colonel, and it was getting dark by the time we got 
there. And the colonel had told me that we were to

42:29.024 --> 42:36.512
augment a police unit to protect this village. 
that the night before they came under attack and

42:37.488 --> 42:43.216
half the police deserted. So he introduces me to 
this commander in this police unit, and this

42:45.700 --> 42:56.195
commander told me where to set up my troops. And 
boy, they put us in the sorriest position they

42:56.215 --> 43:07.090
could think of, where his troops was out here where 
they could see, mine was out here in the, well, it's

42:56.215 --> 43:07.090
not a jungle, but it's, a wooded area, and you 
couldn't see your hands in front of your face at

43:08.234 --> 43:11.418
night. And I was supposed to give him any support 
that he requested. Well, he passed word over to me

43:18.768 --> 43:32.607
that he wanted me to have an artillery fire, H&I, 
harassing and introductory fire, all night. And

43:32.627 --> 43:34.309
he kept wanting the illumination ramp. But he 
wanted the illumination rounds out there in the

43:35.420 --> 43:41.726
front where his troops could see out in these open 
rice paddies where he could see anyhow. But he

43:42.567 --> 43:46.191
didn't know where my troops were so they could see. 
Well, I didn't like the idea of firing all this

43:47.832 --> 43:52.216
stuff all night long. I mean, that's just a waste of 
ammunition. So every now and then I'd have a firing

43:54.819 --> 43:58.202
illumination round. And every now and then an H-9. 
But not all night. But I'd already known that half

44:05.474 --> 44:08.518
of them deserted the night before. So that kind of 
had me worried. They're supposed to be behind us.

44:13.985 --> 44:17.510
We're making a big circle around this village. I 
didn't sleep at all that night. I just kept walking

44:18.731 --> 44:19.833
the line. I wanted to know if they were still back 
there. And then I found out that that commander had

44:23.317 --> 44:31.768
gotten in his vehicle and gone to the village of 
Mito.

44:34.904 --> 44:39.349
And that the night of the battle, he'd also been a 
meantime. So he was not there when his troops came

44:39.610 --> 44:42.874
under fire. That's probably why they deserted.

44:48.140 --> 44:52.145
And there's another reason why I couldn't trust 
the Vietnamese. You don't know if they're going to

44:52.165 --> 44:55.028
be there or where their commander's going to be. 
That's just two different instances that I know

44:56.610 --> 45:01.536
firsthand. I've heard about a lot of other things. 
You can't talk about something second-hand. You

45:07.030 --> 45:08.332
have to know first-hand knowledge.

45:13.880 --> 45:15.803
What did you think about the Vietnamese people? 
Was there much contact? Well, the Vietnamese

45:18.847 --> 45:24.195
people were a few that I had direct contact with. 
The first time in particular, we run into some

45:25.196 --> 45:28.842
civilians. But every time we run into any 
civilians, it was old folks. where they appear to

45:33.173 --> 45:35.416
be at. They age pretty quickly. They might look 
like they're 90 years old and want to be 30. But the

45:41.163 --> 45:49.854
ones we'd come in contact with out at Loon Docks was 
old women and young kids.

45:49.874 --> 45:58.184
The men, they were either drafted in the Army or the 
Viet Cong was drafted. The only time we'd ever run

45:58.384 --> 46:01.408
into a male Because he was either ancient or very, 
very young. If we come into a village and there was a

46:07.161 --> 46:14.792
mid-aged young man, we'd have to be very 
suspicious of him. Because he would probably be a

46:15.593 --> 46:25.007
VC, or he's a deserter from the Oregon Army.

46:25.027 --> 46:28.392
If he's in his teens or twenties.

46:30.093 --> 46:36.400
For the most part, we'd come into these little 
villages, and they'd only be, sometimes it'd be

46:30.093 --> 46:36.400
one hooch. There might be a cluster of six or seven 
hoochies. Inevitably, the little kids would come

46:40.264 --> 46:44.989
up to us and mostly ask them for Salem cigarettes. 
Always Salem. And old Mama Son would come out and

46:48.493 --> 46:54.139
fix up a pot of tea. And all this tea. And flattened 
out bananas. In fact, I ate a banana for a year and

46:58.409 --> 47:01.353
didn't know I was eating a banana. But they were 
friendly to us. But I think they were mostly

47:06.759 --> 47:09.843
friendly to us because they were afraid of us. The 
VC would tell them one thing and we'd try to tell

47:12.286 --> 47:15.970
them another thing. They were totally confused. 
They could care less if we were there or not. They'd

47:21.437 --> 47:22.358
rather we weren't.
