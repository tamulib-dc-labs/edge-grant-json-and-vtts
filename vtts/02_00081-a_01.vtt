WEBVTT

00:02.140 --> 00:04.405
the 25th of February. 23rd. I'm 23rd. I'm sitting 
in room 361 of the Hal Booty building with Tony

00:07.812 --> 00:13.244
Ganji. Tony, try your mic. I'm going to try it. Is it 
working?

00:20.500 --> 00:35.394
Tony, to introduce you to anyone who may read the 
transcript of this or hear this tape in years after

00:20.500 --> 00:35.394
this, describe your background and experience 
before you came to A&M. Where did you grow up? Where

00:36.394 --> 00:37.315
did you go to school? Where had you taught and so 
forth? OK, I was born and raised in Newark, New

00:39.637 --> 00:41.839
Jersey. Went through high school at Newark, New 
Jersey. That was in 1946 I graduated. Went into the

00:50.437 --> 00:54.685
Army, mostly to get the GI Bill, which I got. And 
when I got out of the service in 1948, the folks had

00:55.787 --> 01:01.719
moved to California, Southern California. And so 
I went to UCLA using my GI Bill and started off as an

01:02.520 --> 01:10.015
electrical engineering major. And because of the 
rigidity there was in selecting classes for

01:10.619 --> 01:21.399
electrical engineering majors at that time, I 
decided being an electrical engineer was not what

01:10.619 --> 01:21.399
I wanted to do. So I went over to the physics 
department and became a physics major. And when I

01:26.093 --> 01:39.171
got my degree after more than the four years, 
because I was working all the time, as well as the GI

01:26.093 --> 01:39.171
Bill, I was working all the time to work my way 
through college. And so I ended up graduating with

01:39.872 --> 01:47.022
165 credit hours rather than the usual 120. But 
nevertheless, when I graduated, Ken McKenzie of

01:47.204 --> 01:57.036
the physics department invited me to be a teaching 
assistant. And I took him up on it, became a

01:57.556 --> 02:05.005
graduate teaching assistant, and finished 
getting a master's and PhD at UCLA. Officially got

02:06.006 --> 02:09.010
the PhD in 1960. I officially graduated with a 
bachelor's degree from UCLA in 1952,

02:09.648 --> 02:26.278
got the master's degree in 1953, and officially 
the PhD in 1960, although I had finished up in 1959.

02:26.418 --> 02:31.026
It was a question of writing the dissertation and 
getting it approved. I went to work for Space

02:33.526 --> 02:37.510
General, or it was Space Electronics, it was 
called at that time. It was a company run by Jim

02:37.970 --> 02:50.381
Fletcher, who later became the president of the 
University of Utah, and Frank Leehan, who later

02:37.970 --> 02:50.381
became Secretary of Transportation in Johnson's 
administration. And we worked on weapons

02:50.922 --> 03:01.491
systems, communications, self-focusing 
antenna arrays, underground communication,

03:02.062 --> 03:06.429
side-looking radar, synthetic aperture radar, 
and a lot of those things. And I found it very

03:06.449 --> 03:07.931
interesting. The only problem was I was always 
working on war machines. And I figured I didn't

03:12.238 --> 03:19.449
spend all those years going to school to be working 
on war machines or things like that. So I decided to

03:19.489 --> 03:26.500
leave and go back to the academia. I was fortunate 
enough to get a position at MIT in their geology and

03:26.868 --> 03:32.774
geophysics department. I spent three years 
there. That was in 1964 through 67. And got to meet

03:37.899 --> 03:42.323
some very fine people. Ray Hyde, who is now at the 
British Meteorological Office. I suppose he's

03:47.788 --> 03:49.450
retired by now. Nafi Toxos, who's still at MIT. And 
Frank Press became department head. There were

03:55.015 --> 03:58.579
really a bunch of super people. Ted Madden is 
another one who probably retired by now. And

04:02.664 --> 04:09.632
anyway, in 67, I then came to A&M, and the 
geophysics department was just starting. So I

04:09.652 --> 04:15.940
think I was the fourth member, or actually tied for 
third and fourth. Dave Falk was the first

04:17.141 --> 04:21.046
geophysicist at that time. There had been a 
geophysicist before then. It was Pete Dellinger

04:23.467 --> 04:32.560
and Joe Berg were geophysicists in the early 60s or 
even in the 50s. But they left and went to Oregon

04:32.900 --> 04:36.225
State. And then Dave Falkwas came in 1962. They 
started the College of Geoscience and brought in

04:39.189 --> 04:45.738
Horace Byers, I think, in 1966. Terry Spencer came 
in as the head of geophysics. So he and Dave Falkwas

04:50.425 --> 04:52.748
were... the two members of the geophysics 
department. And then in 1957, Bob Unterberger and

04:56.442 --> 05:00.560
I were both hired. 1967. you said 57 oh yes 67 oh yes 
right right in 67. now actually i must admit that at

05:03.005 --> 05:30.463
the same time john handen came and john handen was 
sort of considered part of the uh geophysics as

05:03.005 --> 05:30.463
well as george sowers who was also part of the 
center for tectonal physics and he was part of

05:03.005 --> 05:30.463
geophysics and i believe john logan also so it was a 
time of rapid growth as far as you know Whose idea

05:31.625 --> 05:40.639
was it that geophysics would get emphasized here 
and that there would be a real first rate program in

05:31.625 --> 05:40.639
geophysics? I really don't know. I think it was 
Horace Byers or Earl Cook had a big influence on it

05:42.952 --> 06:05.135
too, but I suspect that may have come on down either 
from higher up yet than Connolly or Lyndon Johnson

05:42.952 --> 06:05.135
or I doubt Rutter thought so because he just wasn't 
knowledgeable about geophysics. But I think both

06:05.155 --> 06:08.078
Connolly and Johnson were well enough aware of the 
oil industry to recognize that geophysics was

06:08.058 --> 06:21.481
important as well as geology because there's 
always been a very strong geology and petroleum

06:08.058 --> 06:21.481
engineering program at Texas A&M for a long time. 
How did someone identify you? Who was it and what

06:24.847 --> 06:29.475
were the recruiting techniques they used to 
attract you? Well, the thing they'd used to track

06:29.776 --> 06:32.520
me was money. They gave me a good salary. Actually, 
no, that's a joke. Who was the person that

06:38.069 --> 06:42.195
contacted me? I think it might have been Earl Cook 
and Terry Spencer. Do you have any idea who it was

06:46.201 --> 06:49.827
that recommended your name to them? It might have 
been my thesis advisor, Leon Lopoff, and it might

06:50.684 --> 06:59.735
have been Freeman Gilbert from the University of 
California, San Diego. But actually, I don't

07:00.756 --> 07:02.378
know. There were a number of schools that I 
interviewed at that time. I interviewed at Penn

07:06.002 --> 07:11.268
State and Oregon State and Utah also. And I liked 
A&M best because it seemed like they had the best

07:11.628 --> 07:16.955
chance for growth. Describe your impression of 
A&M at that time? Well, it was in pretty bad shape.

07:24.818 --> 07:26.946
It clearly had a lot of room for growth. When I came 
on in and first talked to Terry Spencer John

07:30.863 --> 07:42.182
handed, they were in what's now called the Howe 
Booty building and it was undergoing renovation

07:30.863 --> 07:42.182
and so there were things being repaired all around 
us. Air conditioning ducts were being put in and so

07:42.343 --> 07:50.897
it was really in a pretty bad state of repair. But it 
was clear that there was a plan to do something

07:50.877 --> 07:54.783
about it. It was in the process of being developed. 
And so consequently, that impressed me. And also

08:01.033 --> 08:12.811
the people, Earl Cook, John Hand, and Terry 
Spencer, they're all people who sort of really

08:01.033 --> 08:12.811
felt like, and also Horace Byers, who felt like the 
geophysics was important. And they wanted the

08:12.851 --> 08:15.955
geophysics program to be an important program. 
And I felt like I contributed something, and so I

08:16.396 --> 08:18.960
came. Describe those three men buyers cook and 
Spencer describe them at that time. What were

08:27.420 --> 08:30.351
their responsibilities and their background. 
Okay. Byers was the dean of the College of

08:32.249 --> 08:35.134
Geosciences. He was, I forgot, he came from 
Chicago or someplace like that, but I really

08:35.855 --> 08:41.224
wasn't sure. And he was a very quiet person, but at 
the same time a very dynamic and strong person. He

08:48.336 --> 08:52.763
had his own opinions, and he was very firm about his 
opinions. He also had some very good ideas, but it

08:52.783 --> 08:57.250
was not a real, it didn't, appear to be a pusher 
although he was certainly a guy who could do things

08:57.230 --> 09:02.456
and got things done. Earl Cook on the other hand was 
much more dynamic guy. He was interested in many

09:06.620 --> 09:09.443
different things. He liked to talk and talked very 
well, carried on an excellent conversation. He

09:15.589 --> 09:23.798
was a geologist and geographer and so he was really 
sort of a natural philosopher type more than

09:15.589 --> 09:23.798
anything else. Terry Spencer On the other hand, he 
was also a very quiet guy. He was department head?

09:29.912 --> 09:30.573
Oh, yes, right. Earl Cook was the associate dean, I 
believe. Terry Spencer was the department head.

09:37.122 --> 09:37.963
That's correct. And he had come from Chevron. And 
before that, Chevron Research in La Habra. And

09:44.372 --> 09:46.515
before that, he had been at Caltech. He got his 
degree from Caltech under Hewitt Dix, who was one

09:46.535 --> 09:54.186
of the very famous guys in geophysics from 
Caltech. Terry had done some nice work at that

09:54.166 --> 09:58.310
time. He was a very quiet, very nice, very pleasant 
guy. I also felt that he was somebody who would get

10:03.877 --> 10:09.242
things done. What promises were made to you when 
you were employed, when you were attracted here?

10:20.018 --> 10:29.328
Well, actually, the promises that were made to me 
was that I would be able to work hard and do

10:20.018 --> 10:29.328
something. And I was pretty clear that I had a free 
hand, that I was on the ground floor, so to speak.

10:36.296 --> 10:44.625
There weren't a bunch of old faculty members 
around who were going to say, this is what you could

10:36.296 --> 10:44.625
do, this is what you couldn't do, and this is how we 
did it in the past. We were starting from scratch.

10:45.988 --> 10:52.400
There had been no geophysics department prior to 
that, so it was the beginning of the geophysics

10:45.988 --> 10:52.400
department. I felt that it was a real growth 
opportunity. It was a place where I could make some

10:55.607 --> 10:58.132
impact. I thought the impact I would make was more 
than I actually did make, but nevertheless, the

10:58.613 --> 11:05.787
potential appeared to be there. What salary did 
they, we're not going to talk money except on this,

11:06.391 --> 11:11.383
what salary was the beginning salary? The 
beginning salary wasn't too good as I recall. It

11:15.452 --> 11:20.525
was I think about $16,000 for the full year. It was 
less than the guys from from people who went to the

11:24.093 --> 11:29.279
Center for Tectonal Physics. It was still less 
than what I had earned at Space General before I

11:29.900 --> 11:37.929
left Space General and went to MIT. And when I left 
Space General and went to MIT, I took a 25% cut in

11:38.469 --> 11:46.118
salary to go there. But money has never been the 
most important thing in my life anyway, so it was a

11:46.435 --> 11:54.631
wage in which I could live on. It was certainly a 
valid salary. Did they make any commitment about

11:57.878 --> 12:00.563
research funding? Yes, they did, as a matter of 
fact. And they gave me some research funds. They

12:05.056 --> 12:10.063
gave me money to, well, actually, I guess it was 
more teaching research. My teaching and my

12:10.103 --> 12:12.867
research have always been very closely related. 
And I was given funds to set up a laboratory that I

12:13.228 --> 12:21.741
used in the teaching of the seismology course that 
I taught. And so we went out and we bought some

12:22.301 --> 12:26.027
equipment a digital oscilloscope and parts and 
various electronic parts. I was pretty well

12:32.719 --> 12:37.908
versed in electronics, then still am for that 
matter. The other thing they did is they gave me a

12:39.250 --> 12:45.180
small allotment of money to build a laser strain 
meter. because I had built a laser strain meter at

12:45.667 --> 12:50.954
MIT, which I had set up and got working. I did build a 
laser strain meter, but never really ever got it

12:51.494 --> 13:00.445
set up here at A&M because conditions never seemed 
to be right to do it. But that was about it. Now, from

13:03.049 --> 13:13.902
what you have said so far, it seems that the 
recruitment of the geophysics faculty were from

13:03.049 --> 13:13.902
the big league institutions in geophysics? 
Actually, they weren't. Other than myself, who,

13:20.472 --> 13:28.363
well, see, Dave Falk was from Woods Hole, that's 
true, but Terry Spencer was from Chevron. Now, if

13:28.384 --> 13:30.687
you say where they had graduated. No, that's what I 
mean. Oh, okay. Yes, right. And Bob Unterberger,

13:32.950 --> 13:36.618
too, for that matter, was from UCLA. John Handen 
was from UCLA. But Unterberger also was from

13:38.643 --> 13:43.775
Chevron, Chevron Research. And Handen and his 
crew were from Shell down in Houston. But, let's

13:48.205 --> 13:53.031
see, Mal Friedman got his Ph.D. at Rice. Oh, you 
know about Mal Friedman, right? He walked across

13:56.876 --> 14:02.743
the stage either immediately before me or 
immediately after me when we got our Ph.D.s. I'll

14:02.923 --> 14:03.624
be darned. That's fantastic. Okay. Because there 
was a joke made when they read off the titles of the

14:05.787 --> 14:11.574
dissertations. Yes. And since mine in history... 
about the presbyterian church in the south during

14:14.581 --> 14:39.002
the civil war was fairly easy for anybody to 
understand right they said and thankfully his

14:14.581 --> 14:39.002
dissertation is entitled and when i got off the 
stage friedman kind of gouged me and teased me

14:14.581 --> 14:39.002
about it i see um you you uh you people had big league 
institutional backgrounds and also it seems that

14:40.552 --> 15:05.428
there was a kind of a common thread of real-world 
research space and petroleum and or petroleum

14:40.552 --> 15:05.428
related did that seem to you to be the appropriate 
combination for this department at this

14:40.552 --> 15:05.428
institution Yes, not only for this department or 
this institute, I think for any department or any

15:05.746 --> 15:13.741
institution, I think having some practical 
experience is tremendously valuable. It gives

15:14.362 --> 15:24.801
you a chance to get away from academia and to maybe 
get yourself weaned a little bit so that you get a

15:14.362 --> 15:24.801
little more mature and start working on it. Bob 
Berg, who was the head of the geology department,

15:24.781 --> 15:36.445
he was also in the oil industry for a good while 
before he became the head here, I think also in 1966

15:24.781 --> 15:36.445
or something like that. Describe, if you can, 
getting settled in and getting started that first

15:37.247 --> 15:45.203
semester on this new campus in this new town. Oh, 
well, it wasn't too bad, actually. I looked

15:52.853 --> 15:54.055
around. There were quite a few houses available in 
town, some very nice ones. I bought a nice house. I

16:01.212 --> 16:04.018
think I paid $25,000 for it at the time. A 
four-bedroom, two-story house, brand new. My

16:08.827 --> 16:10.149
wife liked it very much. She kept telling me I 
should have bought a much bigger house, and she was

16:11.111 --> 16:14.777
right. I should have bought a bigger house. I'm 
still living in that same house, by the way, over 30

16:16.220 --> 16:21.349
years later. and there were a number of houses that 
were available in the general area eventually

16:21.329 --> 16:46.729
ended up about two miles away from the school so 
that was pretty easy there were a lot of stuff going

16:21.329 --> 16:46.729
on has he not only in the Enchano Meadows where I 
bought but also Don Cain had been doing stuff in the

16:21.329 --> 16:46.729
Oaks over there off 29th Street there was There 
wasn't as much activity going on in College

16:46.709 --> 16:50.597
Station as I recall. It was mostly in Bryan, close 
to Rosemary and that Stillmeadow area there.

16:59.028 --> 17:03.094
Getting settled into the university itself 
wasn't too bad. And

17:03.114 --> 17:14.612
it wasn't too hard, either, because of the fact 
that the courses that I ended up teaching here were

17:03.114 --> 17:14.612
ones that I had already taught at MIT. So I had a 
bunch of notes already. So it wasn't like I had to

17:17.476 --> 17:23.365
spend a lot of time preparing a bunch of new notes. 
But I've always spent time, however, working on

17:23.345 --> 17:29.832
the notes because the courses are never constant. 
They're always in flux, and you're always doing

17:29.852 --> 17:32.195
something. But I spent a good bit of time at that, 
and I kind of enjoyed it. I got involved with the

17:37.741 --> 17:41.965
people at the Center for Tectonal Physics. I 
thought that was very interesting because they

17:42.025 --> 17:49.133
were doing, again, practical work and doing 
experimental work as a theoretician type. and

17:49.113 --> 17:55.393
electronics type, both, I kind of enjoyed what 
they were doing. did can you share any stories

17:56.015 --> 18:19.626
recollections of what it was like for a youngster 
from New Jersey then California to learn how to get

17:56.015 --> 18:19.626
along in Texas surely there must have been some 
times when somebody didn't understand you

17:56.015 --> 18:19.626
accused you of being from somewhere else well the 
answer to that is I never did learn No, I'm joking.

18:23.874 --> 18:26.839
No, I never really had any serious problems about 
it. The Texans are really very nice people.

18:29.263 --> 18:44.770
They've always been very kind and they've always 
recognized that I was a Yankee and therefore they

18:29.263 --> 18:44.770
expected a certain kind of deviant behavior from 
me and a different kind of manners and style. I

18:44.750 --> 18:46.992
don't think they ever really resented it. They 
would let me know, however, that their behavior

18:47.012 --> 19:03.466
was a little different and should be a little 
different here, but they always did it by their

18:47.012 --> 19:03.466
example, never by telling me, hey, that's wrong, 
don't do it that way, but by the way in which they

18:47.012 --> 19:03.466
would behave. I learned to really calm down a good 
bit more and be a little gentler and a little more

19:04.047 --> 19:13.575
Texan, and it's been a good thing for me in my life. 
Did you ever have any goofs on mispronouncing the

19:13.555 --> 19:21.205
name of this county or some other town around here? 
Not this county, but I've always had a problem with

19:21.265 --> 19:38.128
Mejia and Tyvola and which I now know you know but 
yeah those were always very interesting and But I

19:38.108 --> 19:47.264
was kind of used to that a little bit, too, because 
I'd spent 17 years in California after I got out of

19:38.108 --> 19:47.264
high school, after I got out of the service. And of 
course, it had the Spanish influence there. So you

19:49.849 --> 19:53.516
had San Jose and Tijuana. So it was not 
unreasonable to have things pronounced

19:53.796 --> 19:59.807
differently than which they were spelled. Let's 
see. either as a friend or in any other capacity

20:03.269 --> 20:19.593
attempt to give you guidance as to what some rules 
were at A&M, either written or unwritten?

20:19.614 --> 20:20.895
No, I don't think so. Well, the written rules, I was 
told about the written rules in that there was a

20:21.737 --> 20:25.903
policy and procedure manual. I was expected to 
read it, I found out most of the rules by the hard

20:27.974 --> 20:34.443
way, by butting my head up against it. One of the 
things I really felt very bad about when I came here

20:34.963 --> 20:46.639
is that I had this research money to buy equipment 
with, and so I went on down to the purchasing

20:34.963 --> 20:46.639
department and said, this is the stuff I want to 
order. And they said, well, you can't order that.

20:49.482 --> 20:55.230
You have to go through the submitting procedure 
and so forth and so on. And, of course, it was really

20:55.210 --> 20:58.294
kind of hard for me to understand. It was made clear 
to me that this was to prevent dishonesty or

20:58.675 --> 21:01.960
something. I think that's what it went. And I got 
very resentful about that because I thought I

21:03.642 --> 21:15.820
lived in the United States where you were innocent 
until proven guilty, but apparently as far as

21:03.642 --> 21:15.820
financial disbursements are concerned, you're 
guilty until you're proven innocent. That took a

21:16.441 --> 21:20.847
little while to learn how to do that, but 
eventually I learned, yeah. Now, how did the

21:21.721 --> 21:28.578
department operate in terms of decision making in 
those early years? It was mostly the department

21:29.721 --> 21:33.751
decisions were made in the meetings, as far as I can 
tell. I don't know. what went on when I wasn't

21:36.115 --> 21:37.838
there. But in the meetings, we sat around and we 
talked about what the courses should be, what the

21:37.878 --> 21:49.377
curriculum should be, how we should go about 
recruiting students, and what kind of students we

21:37.878 --> 21:49.377
wanted, and so forth and so on. We had one of the very 
first programs of active student recruitment, I

21:49.878 --> 21:55.828
think, at Texas A&M. where we sent out a bunch of 
letters to national merit or SAT score people, and

21:55.808 --> 22:07.780
we offered them scholarships to those who had done 
well in the science part of it. And we had a large

22:08.621 --> 22:20.213
number of excellent students, because for one 
thing, we could give them a very small

22:08.621 --> 22:20.213
scholarship, and that would make them eligible 
for in-state tuition, which was a big difference

22:08.621 --> 22:20.213
in the tuition. And most of these kids have found 
that most of the students who are just graduating

22:20.193 --> 22:26.379
from high school didn't know what they wanted to 
do. And so if anybody showed any interest

22:26.780 --> 22:30.355
whatsoever in them, about saying, hey, you've got 
a talent for doing such and such. Why don't you try

22:33.365 --> 22:35.288
doing that? We did that. So we had this very strong 
program. We ended up with really some of the best

22:37.753 --> 22:42.742
students on campus in the geophysics department. 
They were so good that everybody was trying to

22:43.042 --> 22:45.326
steal them from us. And they did very 
successfully, which was all right. We didn't

22:48.392 --> 22:49.273
really mind. But we had a bunch of good ones. So most 
of the decisions were made in the department

22:51.277 --> 23:03.619
meetings, and they were mostly decisions about 
academic matters, you know, courses. The

23:03.639 --> 23:12.475
students here, how did they compare with the 
students you had known at other institutions in

23:03.639 --> 23:12.475
terms of quality? Our undergraduates were very, 
very good. I think they were probably as good as the

23:18.266 --> 23:24.608
ones that are at UCLA. The graduate students 
weren't quite as good. However, I will say that the

23:27.873 --> 23:35.967
best graduate students we had were every bit as 
good as the graduate students at MIT. But at MIT,

23:36.468 --> 23:39.293
they were all tremendous. Whereas here, the best 
ones were as good as that, and then they would tail

23:39.694 --> 23:44.723
off quite a bit. The undergraduates were, we had a 
good strong bunch in there because of this

23:44.703 --> 23:55.641
recruiting program and it was surprisingly 
because of the the scholarship thing and the

23:56.363 --> 24:01.671
tuition waiver for out-of-state. A lot of them 
were from out-of-state. A lot of the students were

24:03.253 --> 24:04.936
from out-of-state. And so they were quite 
excellent. Of course, we had some students from

24:08.241 --> 24:11.626
in-state that were excellent, too. But really, I 
say overall, the better students came from

24:12.107 --> 24:15.672
out-of-state. The source of that scholarship 
money, what was it? The oil company. We had set up a

24:21.560 --> 24:23.303
program. We had talked about this in the 
department meeting. It was my feeling, too. Look,

24:28.694 --> 24:29.836
we're here in Texas. And at that time, the oil 
industry was really the big industry in Texas. And

24:36.247 --> 24:38.009
we're geophysicists. Well, if we don't cater to 
the oil industry or train our students to be able to

24:38.349 --> 24:48.482
get jobs in the oil industry, well, we're just not 
meeting our obligation as a state university. And

24:48.822 --> 24:50.424
that was an obligation that I felt. And I think most 
of the other faculty agreed. And we've always had a

24:53.548 --> 24:58.334
curriculum that was very applied geophysics 
oriented. We have done some things in global

24:58.755 --> 25:02.179
geophysics. But the major part of it has been in 
exploration geophysics, certainly at the

25:02.159 --> 25:09.127
undergraduate level and at the master's level. 
When you get to the PhD level, why then the problems

25:09.147 --> 25:15.574
almost have to be more global than exploration. So 
because of that, having very good students, and

25:16.175 --> 25:24.184
the oil companies were looking for good students, 
they would come and they would recruit. And so

25:24.164 --> 25:27.669
whenever they came and recruited, we said, look 
it, you want good students? We can get good

25:28.249 --> 25:30.192
students, but we need money. Give us the money and 
we'll get good students. You're not doing us any

25:32.896 --> 25:35.419
favors by giving us the money. Well, they really 
were, of course, because we were getting better

25:35.780 --> 25:38.623
students. I said, you know, because you're just 
making more work for us, right? I said, but if you do

25:41.587 --> 25:47.195
that, why, then we'll have good quality students 
when you come here to recruit. And they were very,

25:47.615 --> 25:51.741
very generous in that regard. Are there some oil 
companies that deserve special mention that were

25:51.721 --> 25:56.907
more generous? Yeah, let's see. I believe Amoco 
was one of them that was really very active. And

26:04.897 --> 26:08.982
Phillips Petroleum was also a good one. And Shell

26:09.002 --> 26:13.307
was very helpful. The others were also helpful, 
but not quite as much. But those people were very,

26:17.793 --> 26:19.756
very active. As a matter of fact, Gary Servos of 
Amoco would come and actually set up seismic

26:20.057 --> 26:28.208
chutes in the area for the students and things of 
that sort. It was really tremendous. In the late

26:29.991 --> 26:42.889
60s and early 70s, for geosciences undergraduate 
students, what were the tough courses, either

26:29.991 --> 26:42.889
within the department or outside, that were kind 
of the gateway courses? Well,

26:43.949 --> 27:05.721
for our students there weren't many tough courses 
in the first two years and part of the problem there

26:43.949 --> 27:05.721
was that we didn't have any geophysics courses in 
the first two years because they were all taking

26:43.949 --> 27:05.721
the chemistry, physics, and math that We felt that 
a geophysicist, as well as geology. We had some

27:08.804 --> 27:12.488
good, tough geology courses that they were 
teaching them. And as a matter of fact, that was one

27:13.028 --> 27:21.577
thing that we had to do something about because we 
hardly got to see our students until they were

27:13.028 --> 27:21.577
juniors. And by that time, they were being stolen 
away from us because all these other people had

27:22.217 --> 27:28.644
seen them and saw what great students they were. 
They recruited them for their department. So we

27:31.827 --> 27:34.189
set up some courses. at the freshman level and the 
sophomore level, for the geophysics majors. They

27:41.900 --> 27:45.903
were solid courses, but we weren't trying to do any 
weeding. We were trying to do some retention.

27:48.406 --> 27:53.090
Actually, we never did any real weeding in trying 
to do that. If there was any attrition, the

27:54.291 --> 28:01.557
attrition was natural by the chemistry, the 
physics, and the math courses, which are tough

27:54.291 --> 28:01.557
courses. They would compete with the physicists, 
mathematicians, and the engineers. Let's make

28:07.362 --> 28:13.218
believe you were an undergraduate advisor in that 
period. What courses, if a student came in for

28:14.722 --> 28:23.346
advice, what freshman and sophomore courses did 
you look at most carefully to see how they had done?

28:24.338 --> 28:26.322
Oh, I looked at their math and physics courses. 
Math and physics. Oh, yes, primarily. And also

28:30.110 --> 28:42.735
their English course that they took as well, 
because that's one of the things that we found at

28:30.110 --> 28:42.735
that time, and it's still true, it's even more true 
now, is that the greatest training these kids

28:30.110 --> 28:42.735
needed was in communication. And being 
geophysicists, they weren't really scientists

28:42.715 --> 28:47.802
in the pure scientist sense. These were guys who 
were going to be applied scientists. And as

28:50.566 --> 28:53.050
applied scientists, therefore, they had to 
communicate. And furthermore, if they were going

28:53.370 --> 29:03.945
to go into the oil business, what they were 
supposed to do was work up a prospect and make a

28:53.370 --> 29:03.945
convincing story to management that this 
prospect was a good one, that they should drill it,

28:53.370 --> 29:03.945
and so forth and so on. So communications was very 
important. So very early in the game, we looked at

29:06.349 --> 29:11.997
their English grades. In those early years, how 
adequate were the classrooms and laboratory

29:11.977 --> 29:21.151
facilities for teaching and research in 
geophysics? The ones that were in our department

29:23.094 --> 29:27.240
were fine. It was really not very difficult. There 
weren't very many students, though, because at

29:29.423 --> 29:35.172
the peak, I think we had maybe 30 students in a 
class. So it was always a small program. And given

29:39.382 --> 29:45.990
that the program is that small, you've got 15 kids 
in a class, there's no way that you can do anything

29:39.382 --> 29:45.990
but a quality program. You really would have to be a 
bad teacher not to do a good job with that few

29:47.071 --> 29:56.843
students, especially when they were very bright 
students, which is what they were. What was the

29:57.303 --> 30:03.691
normal workload for you in terms of hours to teach 
per semester during those early years? I

30:04.852 --> 30:07.836
generally taught two courses per semester. And 
sometimes I would do three, but the third one would

30:08.288 --> 30:17.081
be a seminar or something like that, which really 
didn't take a lot of time and effort. Later on, I

30:17.542 --> 30:18.764
taught more. But the teaching load has always been 
very, very light in geophysics. The idea was that

30:23.751 --> 30:28.117
we were supposed to, they expected us to do 
research. They expected us to get research

30:28.598 --> 30:31.883
grants. They expected us to have graduate 
students, because you supported the graduate

30:31.863 --> 30:38.351
students with research grants and so forth and so 
on. And so there was that. So the teaching load, I

30:40.133 --> 30:44.859
think, was quite light, my personal opinion. And 
within the department, were good standards set in

30:45.780 --> 30:56.132
those early years for the faculty in terms of 
promotion and tenure and so forth? Oh, I think so. I

30:59.001 --> 31:06.877
remember I had to make a big deal and threaten to 
leave in order to get my promotion, but I got it. I

31:06.917 --> 31:08.641
wasn't too old. I think I was 40 years old or 
something like that. So I guess if I hadn't

31:11.166 --> 31:15.876
threatened, I probably would have gotten it in the 
next year.
