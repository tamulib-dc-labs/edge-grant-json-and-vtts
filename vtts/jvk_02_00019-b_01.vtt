WEBVTT

00:00:01.718 --> 00:00:10.826
Or whether he just went back to the department for a while.

00:00:11.667 --> 00:00:13.368
I guess maybe he did retire.

00:00:14.769 --> 00:00:17.772
I know we made a trip to California.

00:00:17.852 --> 00:00:26.680
We were in a cafe in Santa Barbara and suddenly saw Byers across the room.

00:00:27.200 --> 00:00:30.443
I went over and talked to him.

00:00:31.604 --> 00:00:45.125
Anyway, Calhoun brought with him as his associate academic vice president Dick Winerdi, who had the ambition to become graduate dean, I think.

00:00:46.627 --> 00:00:57.544
And Calhoun made it awful hard on George for a long time, and I never had much use for

00:01:00.157 --> 00:01:17.999
He's become a great friend now, and I always respected Winerdi in a way because he stayed with his wife in spite of her cancer and losing her leg and all that, which a lot of people wouldn't have done.

00:01:19.642 --> 00:01:26.170
But I sure wouldn't have wanted him as my boss, I'll tell you.

00:01:26.190 --> 00:01:26.350
Why not?

00:01:29.030 --> 00:01:31.893
He thought he was the greatest thing since sliced cheese.

00:01:33.936 --> 00:01:36.759
I couldn't work for him.

00:01:36.779 --> 00:01:38.041
I just couldn't.

00:01:38.401 --> 00:01:45.049
Did Calhoun change the duties, the task of the graduate college in any way?

00:01:49.875 --> 00:01:50.956
Basically, no.

00:01:52.338 --> 00:01:54.040
I was hoping that's the answer you would give.

00:01:58.104 --> 00:01:58.665
He made it.

00:01:58.966 --> 00:02:02.753
hard on George but he didn't really change anything.

00:02:05.198 --> 00:02:17.683
Actually if he changed anything, well the only thing he could have changed was to

00:02:23.705 --> 00:02:36.258
Well, they did a few years later, much to the joy of the deans and much to the detriment of the graduate program, I think.

00:02:36.278 --> 00:02:37.579
But that's after you, isn't it?

00:02:39.921 --> 00:02:42.104
Yeah.

00:02:42.124 --> 00:02:46.028
I was the last graduate dean unless they reestablished it.

00:02:46.048 --> 00:02:46.468
All right.

00:02:46.488 --> 00:02:52.294
Dr. Calhoun, when he became the vice president for academic

00:03:00.830 --> 00:03:02.091
Yeah.

00:03:02.111 --> 00:03:10.800
When Dr. Calhoun became the vice president, he moved the VP office over to the Teague Building.

00:03:12.001 --> 00:03:14.264
You all remained in the Koch Building, didn't you?

00:03:15.545 --> 00:03:20.710
No, we moved to Teague Building at some point in time.

00:03:21.010 --> 00:03:22.472
But not as soon as he moved.

00:03:24.134 --> 00:03:25.955
That was after you became the dean, didn't he?

00:03:26.276 --> 00:03:26.516
No.

00:03:26.936 --> 00:03:27.657
Oh.

00:03:27.677 --> 00:03:28.558
Was it with George?

00:03:28.707 --> 00:03:31.990
Yeah, we were in the coat building for a long time.

00:03:32.270 --> 00:03:41.559
The medical school was down the hall and we shared a coffee area.

00:03:43.260 --> 00:03:49.706
We used to eat lunch in my office.

00:03:49.906 --> 00:03:51.688
We all took our lunch.

00:03:51.708 --> 00:03:57.313
We were sitting there one day, looked up at the wall.

00:03:57.800 --> 00:04:12.552
They put the bookshelves up with these screws in the drywall, and I looked up, and the books were all peeling off the wall and coming right onto the drawers.

00:04:13.375 --> 00:04:18.902
He let out a yell, and he ducked, and the whole thing just crashed all around you.

00:04:18.922 --> 00:04:34.080
All right, now, in the last Rutter years and the Williams years, the graduate programs began to grow in number and variety and quality.

00:04:35.302 --> 00:04:40.328
Describe how and why that came about.

00:04:41.033 --> 00:04:56.333
I think Williams and Calhoun both wanted the graduate program to grow.

00:04:58.476 --> 00:05:05.245
The better departments were encouraged to establish degree programs.

00:05:05.686 --> 00:05:07.328
Where did the funding come from?

00:05:10.480 --> 00:05:16.169
Well, the funding came through the departments, actually.

00:05:16.429 --> 00:05:17.451
And where'd they get it, though?

00:05:18.853 --> 00:05:20.175
Depended on who they were.

00:05:21.397 --> 00:05:36.201
Education got theirs from the Department of Education in the state, and science got theirs primarily from National Science Foundation with a few

00:05:37.345 --> 00:05:51.507
Others like the DEA and folks in the research.

00:05:51.527 --> 00:05:59.419
Which deans deserve the highest credit for moving their graduate programs forward?

00:06:01.522 --> 00:06:03.605
Which colleges or schools did?

00:06:04.967 --> 00:06:06.289
Science, certainly.

00:06:06.995 --> 00:06:13.704
Under John Fackler, grew tremendously.

00:06:14.906 --> 00:06:23.838
Education grew, but I'm not sure.

00:06:26.581 --> 00:06:32.209
Under Hubert and then Corrigan?

00:06:32.847 --> 00:06:33.728
Yeah, of course they do.

00:06:34.549 --> 00:06:39.296
But I've always been hesitant about the quality of education.

00:06:40.337 --> 00:06:54.997
I guess it's because they probably don't understand it, but it seems to me that their quality is not what it should be.

00:06:55.017 --> 00:06:57.100
Now, you became dean when?

00:07:04.150 --> 00:07:05.792
No, but you became dean when?

00:07:05.812 --> 00:07:06.632
84.

00:07:06.652 --> 00:07:07.373
84, okay.

00:07:08.094 --> 00:07:32.217
So during those years of Williams, Jarvis Miller, Vandiver, under those presidents, were there any opportunities at the graduate level that you now in hindsight think we missed?

00:07:32.197 --> 00:08:00.988
are there some things that we might have done and or might have done better well we might have not done away with the graduate college right whose idea was that uh i'm not sure because uh who went to iowa uh eat gordon eaton when he heard that

00:08:01.576 --> 00:08:03.318
They'd done away with the graduate college.

00:08:03.338 --> 00:08:05.601
He said, that's not what I recommended.

00:08:07.864 --> 00:08:19.139
And Matt Prescott was academic vice president then, and I'm not sure he was enthusiastic about it.

00:08:19.420 --> 00:08:23.806
Vanderbilt is a guy who did it, I think.

00:08:25.067 --> 00:08:29.473
And Anderson, who was vice president of research,

00:08:29.875 --> 00:08:35.060
was all for it, because he wanted to get his hands on the budget.

00:08:35.260 --> 00:08:48.932
And I noticed after I retired and took over my old office, we had all new furniture.

00:08:49.673 --> 00:08:59.882
He was acting as the Colt graduate dean and vice president for research.

00:09:00.655 --> 00:09:10.631
And just about killed the person who was my executive secretary in that year.

00:09:11.993 --> 00:09:15.779
And she retired, got away from me.

00:09:15.799 --> 00:09:16.040
All right.

00:09:16.060 --> 00:09:21.468
So you worked with George Coombs for 15 years or so.

00:09:23.832 --> 00:09:25.735
What were some of the happiest moments?

00:09:28.246 --> 00:09:29.327
Christmas parties.

00:09:30.369 --> 00:09:32.171
Where did you all have the Christmas parties?

00:09:35.295 --> 00:09:44.726
Oh, I think when we got some of our degree programs through the coordinating board were happy times.

00:09:44.826 --> 00:09:47.349
Describe getting a program through the coordinating board.

00:09:47.390 --> 00:09:48.291
What all did it take?

00:09:49.772 --> 00:09:53.477
Well, first of all, the department would have to

00:09:55.600 --> 00:10:01.227
propose a program, they'd have to go through all the channels at the university.

00:10:02.809 --> 00:10:08.796
Then it would go to the coordinating board and the board would review it.

00:10:09.277 --> 00:10:13.542
And they'd also send it out to all the other universities for them to review.

00:10:15.004 --> 00:10:20.631
And if they thought it was going to impinge on their territory, they'd recommend against it.

00:10:21.792 --> 00:10:24.696
So it was a give and take thing.

00:10:25.064 --> 00:10:32.333
What institutions were the major obstacles to get them approved?

00:10:32.353 --> 00:10:33.855
What other Texas schools were the?

00:10:35.036 --> 00:10:40.643
I would say probably University of Houston and University of Texas.

00:10:43.627 --> 00:10:46.671
Do you remember any that were turned down that should have been approved?

00:10:49.614 --> 00:10:54.160
Yeah, an architecture that was one of which is now approved.

00:10:55.861 --> 00:11:06.032
for building construction, I think, that somebody didn't want done.

00:11:07.274 --> 00:11:16.064
There's a music program now that's approved, I think, which would have been nice to have done.

00:11:16.364 --> 00:11:19.928
But we didn't seek a music program then, did we?

00:11:21.275 --> 00:11:29.885
Did we end up losing many of those battles, or did we eventually win in almost every case for the new?

00:11:29.906 --> 00:11:32.148
I think we eventually won in almost every case.

00:11:32.168 --> 00:11:33.009
That's what I thought.

00:11:35.032 --> 00:11:35.452
Yeah.

00:11:35.552 --> 00:11:43.662
It was a long, drawn-out process, but I can't think of a single one that we lost.

00:11:43.682 --> 00:11:46.346
Can you remember any kind of goofy moments?

00:11:47.547 --> 00:11:49.189
Silly, strange, weird?

00:11:53.658 --> 00:11:55.099
Yeah, not really.

00:11:57.041 --> 00:12:00.025
Ken Ashworth was the commissioner in those years.

00:12:00.225 --> 00:12:02.047
What do you mean?

00:12:02.147 --> 00:12:02.427
Yeah.

00:12:03.268 --> 00:12:04.789
Oh, there were a lot of goofy moments.

00:12:04.809 --> 00:12:07.472
Such as?

00:12:08.333 --> 00:12:16.962
People would get up and make a long speech that didn't have anything to do with what the problem was.

00:12:17.743 --> 00:12:21.066
Yeah, Ken Ashworth was the commissioner.

00:12:23.240 --> 00:12:34.331
And when I retired, he called me up and let me come over there for a year when they had a vacancy.

00:12:36.873 --> 00:12:42.018
I couldn't see going to Austin for a year.

00:12:42.318 --> 00:12:44.100
He meant to join his staff for a year.

00:12:45.942 --> 00:12:50.226
Describe him, the way he handled his duties as commissioner.

00:12:54.830 --> 00:13:02.117
I think he did a good job.

00:13:02.997 --> 00:13:04.359
I would sure give him high marks.

00:13:04.419 --> 00:13:06.060
Yeah, I would too.

00:13:07.601 --> 00:13:09.423
I wouldn't give his wife high marks.

00:13:09.743 --> 00:13:10.764
No, I wouldn't either.

00:13:11.285 --> 00:13:12.686
But I'd give him high marks.

00:13:13.587 --> 00:13:20.673
And in general, was A&M treated fairly by him and his staff?

00:13:20.994 --> 00:13:24.837
I think so.

00:13:25.897 --> 00:13:30.042
I don't think anybody was ever treated unfairly over there.

00:13:30.062 --> 00:13:40.536
A lot of people thought they were, but it was my impression that they were pretty level-handed.

00:13:40.956 --> 00:13:48.686
In getting new degrees approved on campus, what were the major hurdles on campus?

00:13:50.889 --> 00:13:54.874
The department submitted a proposal to the graduate college

00:13:55.124 --> 00:13:57.026
Well, no, it had to go through their dean.

00:13:57.426 --> 00:13:58.267
Through their dean.

00:13:58.828 --> 00:13:59.228
Then where?

00:13:59.288 --> 00:14:00.910
To the graduate college.

00:14:02.872 --> 00:14:06.036
But the graduate college didn't make any decision really.

00:14:06.236 --> 00:14:18.429
It went to the graduate council, which had representatives from all the colleges and then elected members too.

00:14:19.230 --> 00:14:21.833
Who chaired the council?

00:14:21.853 --> 00:14:22.093
The dean.

00:14:22.534 --> 00:14:22.954
The dean.

00:14:25.972 --> 00:14:33.722
Did the council give approval in general where it should have?

00:14:38.127 --> 00:14:45.276
Yeah, I think with a few exceptions the Graduate Council did a good job.

00:14:45.296 --> 00:14:51.203
They got a little bit, what am I trying to say?

00:14:54.254 --> 00:14:57.498
They got factionists, I guess.

00:14:57.518 --> 00:15:00.282
They had factions that were fighting.

00:15:00.302 --> 00:15:05.128
In general, the factions were included whom?

00:15:06.009 --> 00:15:06.770
Who was on what?

00:15:07.751 --> 00:15:14.580
Well, I didn't know there were factions, but it turns out there were factions.

00:15:16.643 --> 00:15:22.270
And I didn't find out there were factions until much after the fact.

00:15:23.414 --> 00:15:27.939
Did agriculture and engineering quite often?

00:15:28.059 --> 00:15:37.488
No, these were not program type factions.

00:15:37.568 --> 00:15:47.478
They were people trying to get into the office of the graduate dean.

00:15:47.778 --> 00:15:50.321
People who didn't want people in.

00:15:51.282 --> 00:15:53.404
It got pretty messy at the end.

00:15:56.860 --> 00:15:58.842
Right.

00:15:58.862 --> 00:16:19.628
During all of your years of service, either as associate dean or as dean, do you remember any effort by a politician, a former student, any kind of outsider, do you remember any attempt to interfere in the graduate matters?

00:16:21.548 --> 00:16:29.162
It may have happened with the dean, but with me it never happened.

00:16:29.563 --> 00:16:31.186
No Board of Regents?

00:16:32.528 --> 00:16:32.749
No.

00:16:34.692 --> 00:16:38.359
It happened when I was at NSF.

00:16:38.693 --> 00:16:42.699
It never happened here for me.

00:16:42.719 --> 00:16:52.635
During all of those years, back to some of, I said, the happy moments, some of the proudest moments when you thought we were really making progress?

00:16:56.080 --> 00:17:03.351
You know, Haskell, I can't think of...

00:17:04.985 --> 00:17:14.795
particularly proud moment or a particularly bad moment, it kept things pretty much uneven.

00:17:14.815 --> 00:17:22.884
I guess one of my proudest moments was when I was elected chairman of the Council of Graduate Schools in Texas.

00:17:26.788 --> 00:17:27.829
When did that come?

00:17:31.313 --> 00:17:31.934
Early 80s?

00:17:32.754 --> 00:17:33.355
Yeah.

00:17:34.027 --> 00:17:35.549
And what did that...

00:17:35.930 --> 00:17:37.653
Cozy was still dean.

00:17:38.133 --> 00:17:39.315
Who?

00:17:39.335 --> 00:17:39.676
Oh.

00:17:39.896 --> 00:17:51.654
Cozy was still dean, but he appointed me the A&M representative to the Council of Texas Graduate Schools.

00:17:51.674 --> 00:17:53.096
Describe that organization.

00:17:55.140 --> 00:18:01.890
It was an organization of all the graduate schools in Texas.

00:18:02.832 --> 00:18:09.259
Which met once a year just to discuss problems, have drinks.

00:18:10.501 --> 00:18:11.682
You all met about how often?

00:18:12.122 --> 00:18:13.424
Once a year.

00:18:13.564 --> 00:18:14.065
In Austin?

00:18:14.865 --> 00:18:16.948
No, seldom in Austin.

00:18:17.709 --> 00:18:20.552
Matter of fact, I don't think we ever met in Austin.

00:18:21.333 --> 00:18:26.799
Who were the most significant people or institutions during that time?

00:18:28.861 --> 00:18:29.802
Who were the leaders?

00:18:37.949 --> 00:18:54.396
I became very friendly with the dean at Baylor and the dean at Texas and East Texas State.

00:18:55.959 --> 00:19:03.872
Of course, now a lot of those are A&M.

00:19:08.375 --> 00:19:18.349
But everybody seemed to just be on a par in that organization.

00:19:18.529 --> 00:19:21.133
Nobody pushed anybody around.

00:19:21.653 --> 00:19:25.679
Now, was everybody's graduate program growing during those years?

00:19:27.221 --> 00:19:27.902
I think so.

00:19:29.958 --> 00:19:37.506
And whom did you consider our Texas A&M's cohorts?

00:19:37.526 --> 00:19:43.131
Who were our A&M's at the graduate level, who were the primary equals of A&M?

00:19:44.192 --> 00:19:50.539
In Texas?

00:19:50.559 --> 00:19:53.742
Well, it depends on the field.

00:19:55.544 --> 00:19:56.725
There wasn't anybody.

00:19:57.363 --> 00:20:03.891
for example, who could compete in veterinary medicine, because we had the only one.

00:20:03.911 --> 00:20:13.082
Engineering, I would guess UT and A&M were on a par, or UT was a little ahead of us.

00:20:14.584 --> 00:20:25.497
And science, there were certain areas where A&M was ahead and certain areas where

00:20:27.097 --> 00:20:27.638
E.T.

00:20:27.698 --> 00:20:28.259
was ahead.

00:20:29.220 --> 00:20:36.810
Geoscience, we were way ahead in most everything except geophysics.

00:20:42.698 --> 00:20:48.346
Education, there were such a thing as being ahead in education.

00:20:48.366 --> 00:20:53.813
I guess we were at least on par with everybody else.

00:20:55.463 --> 00:20:58.526
Did the private schools participate fully in that?

00:20:59.487 --> 00:21:00.308
Yeah.

00:21:00.328 --> 00:21:02.550
Rice and SMU and Baylor and so forth?

00:21:07.115 --> 00:21:07.355
All of them.

00:21:07.375 --> 00:21:11.679
Who were your, which schools were your favorite colleagues?

00:21:13.021 --> 00:21:16.264
Oh, as I said, Angelo's State.

00:21:16.284 --> 00:21:17.005
Oh, you mentioned that.

00:21:17.045 --> 00:21:17.425
I'm sorry.

00:21:17.545 --> 00:21:17.805
Yeah.

00:21:18.006 --> 00:21:24.492
The University of Houston didn't participate because they didn't have a graduate school.

00:21:25.315 --> 00:21:30.000
They were like A&M as well, splattered all over.

00:21:30.500 --> 00:21:34.464
And they decided they had to get a graduate school.

00:21:34.524 --> 00:21:36.846
It just wasn't working the way it was.

00:21:37.787 --> 00:21:46.275
And they appointed an associate provost to bring everything back together and reestablish a graduate school, and he couldn't do it.

00:21:47.657 --> 00:21:53.162
The deans just had too much power.

00:21:55.589 --> 00:22:05.178
The office moved under Calhoun, moved over from the Koch building to the Teague building, and then how long did it remain there?

00:22:08.220 --> 00:22:11.103
It was there during all of your years.

00:22:11.143 --> 00:22:24.415
And who were the key office staff members while you were in the 70s and 80s?

00:22:25.981 --> 00:22:29.767
Well, Jane Thompson was executive secretary.

00:22:30.067 --> 00:22:35.595
Describe Jane.

00:22:39.681 --> 00:22:41.724
She was a very emotional person.

00:22:44.168 --> 00:22:49.035
Had a lot of family problems.

00:22:52.677 --> 00:22:58.463
Now, her mother had also worked on the campus a long time, hadn't she?

00:22:59.324 --> 00:23:01.727
She grew up in the systems building.

00:23:01.747 --> 00:23:04.249
Okay.

00:23:04.269 --> 00:23:09.155
What is now the Jack Williams building.

00:23:09.175 --> 00:23:09.275
Yeah.

00:23:09.295 --> 00:23:13.920
And was she the key staff member for Coonsey and you?

00:23:15.782 --> 00:23:15.902
Yeah.

00:23:15.982 --> 00:23:16.583
Reliable?

00:23:17.964 --> 00:23:19.846
Totally reliable.

00:23:19.866 --> 00:23:20.507
Hard worker?

00:23:21.448 --> 00:23:21.688
Hard worker.

00:23:22.073 --> 00:23:33.925
Did she ever, did she have the spunk to call attention to what she thought was an error in judgment that y'all were, how did she do that?

00:23:35.066 --> 00:23:35.826
How'd she go about it?

00:23:36.107 --> 00:23:38.349
Just come in and say, look at this.

00:23:39.590 --> 00:23:50.781
And I'll tell you, the three years I was dean, I'm not sure I could have survived without her.

00:23:51.267 --> 00:24:08.270
knew when certain reports were due and she knew when everything was due and many times she did most of the reports herself.

00:24:09.011 --> 00:24:15.460
And how did you attempt to convey to her your appreciation of her efforts?

00:24:17.163 --> 00:24:20.447
I thanked her.

00:24:21.963 --> 00:24:23.946
It was interesting.

00:24:24.987 --> 00:24:27.190
I used to give her a scarf every Christmas.

00:24:28.131 --> 00:24:34.820
Finally one day she said, you know I'm not a scarf person.

00:24:34.840 --> 00:24:38.966
So I started giving her something else for Christmas.

00:24:41.149 --> 00:24:44.393
Let's see, then in terms of the vice presidents,

00:24:44.963 --> 00:24:46.385
before we call them provost.

00:24:47.967 --> 00:24:51.892
Calhoun is followed by Mac Prescott in 1977.

00:24:55.157 --> 00:24:59.843
Describe the way he related to the graduate college compared to Calhoun.

00:25:03.688 --> 00:25:05.150
Well, there were a lot of changes.

00:25:05.170 --> 00:25:09.336
Gordon Heaton was in between.

00:25:09.356 --> 00:25:09.697
No.

00:25:09.717 --> 00:25:11.179
Heaton's after Prescott.

00:25:12.300 --> 00:25:13.722
Jarvis picked Prescott.

00:25:17.667 --> 00:25:18.989
Prescott was after.

00:25:20.010 --> 00:25:22.493
No, because see, that's when I'm dean of faculties.

00:25:23.013 --> 00:25:30.101
Well, I was reporting to Prescott the last year I was in office.

00:25:30.121 --> 00:25:45.199
And then Eaton follows, Eaton was dean over in geosciences, and then he follows under Vandiver, he follows Prescott.

00:25:45.219 --> 00:25:46.240
Well, Prescott must have

00:25:49.477 --> 00:25:49.918
I don't know.

00:25:51.880 --> 00:25:52.621
Who followed him?

00:25:53.722 --> 00:25:54.123
I don't know.

00:25:57.847 --> 00:26:04.595
Is it Donald McDonald, the business dean?

00:26:06.998 --> 00:26:17.070
Well, I don't know, Haskell, but the last person that I reported to was Prescott.

00:26:19.885 --> 00:26:27.435
Because Prescott left in 82, I think, under Vandiver.

00:26:29.618 --> 00:26:32.602
Because apparently he and Vandiver didn't drive that well.

00:26:35.345 --> 00:26:44.417
Well, anyway, describe what were the different, did Prescott change anything from the way Calhoun did?

00:26:44.437 --> 00:26:49.504
Nobody changed anything until we got a vice president for research.

00:26:50.750 --> 00:26:54.837
And they put the Graduate College under Anderson and then everything fell apart.

00:26:55.178 --> 00:26:56.820
Now whose decision was that?

00:26:57.542 --> 00:26:58.724
I think it was Vanderveer's.

00:26:59.785 --> 00:27:09.662
And I, my last year, I was supposed to report to Anderson and I wouldn't.

00:27:10.403 --> 00:27:13.448
And I swear I went to Prescott.

00:27:15.071 --> 00:27:16.133
It sure wasn't eaten.

00:27:17.851 --> 00:27:26.362
But anyway, I would never report directly to Anderson.

00:27:26.983 --> 00:27:29.106
Why did you feel that was inappropriate?

00:27:30.968 --> 00:27:44.366
Because he was trying to rob the budget of the graduate colleges as academic vice president for research.

00:27:46.228 --> 00:27:47.470
I don't know.

00:27:47.669 --> 00:27:52.315
I was all in favor of him when they reviewed him.

00:27:53.417 --> 00:27:58.825
And when he got there, he was nothing like he came across in the reviews.

00:27:58.945 --> 00:27:59.886
Where did he come from?

00:28:01.388 --> 00:28:02.309
Was he an outsider?

00:28:02.650 --> 00:28:02.970
Yeah.

00:28:02.990 --> 00:28:03.751
New to A&M?

00:28:04.613 --> 00:28:11.162
He was a Jack Mormon, but he may have come from Utah.

00:28:11.242 --> 00:28:12.023
I'm not sure.

00:28:12.728 --> 00:28:17.714
But he had no relationship with any of them at all.

00:28:17.734 --> 00:28:27.304
Now, am I correct in thinking that one of the primary functions of the graduate college was quality control of graduate work?

00:28:28.406 --> 00:28:28.666
Right.

00:28:30.208 --> 00:28:34.693
Yeah, that was one of our biggest problems was controlling quality.

00:28:37.336 --> 00:28:41.200
People in, well, for example, chemistry

00:28:41.686 --> 00:28:58.465
degree program composed a hundred percent of research, and people in education would want a Ph.D. program with only four or five hours of research.

00:29:02.149 --> 00:29:06.934
They're going to do it anyway, but at least you can make it look good.

00:29:09.631 --> 00:29:25.370
We made, we required the chemistry people to take some courses and we required the education people to officially complete some research.

00:29:27.452 --> 00:29:31.437
They obviously were going to have to do it whether it was on their degree program or not.

00:29:32.979 --> 00:29:38.305
But we turned down some degree thesis, dissertation proposals too.

00:29:39.753 --> 00:29:53.373
Give some examples of the sort of thing that- We had one guy that wanted to write a dissertation on singing cadets.

00:29:58.781 --> 00:30:08.595
There's not much dissertation quality material in the singing cadets.

00:30:10.212 --> 00:30:28.032
But the main sponsor we had in the dissertations were actually in, dissertation proposals were actually in education.

00:30:32.317 --> 00:30:38.464
Then there was always English which, where they never wanted anybody to finish.

00:30:40.958 --> 00:30:41.519
What do you mean?

00:30:42.480 --> 00:30:47.788
Well, they just seemed to, well, history was much the same way.

00:30:47.808 --> 00:30:50.231
They wanted a book instead of a dissertation.

00:30:50.251 --> 00:30:52.374
Oh, you went on and on and on?

00:30:52.574 --> 00:30:52.735
Yeah.

00:30:52.755 --> 00:30:58.202
700 page dissertation.

00:30:58.222 --> 00:31:04.752
Do you remember any of the extreme, like for that, some examples of the briefest and the longest?

00:31:06.094 --> 00:31:07.776
No.

00:31:08.735 --> 00:31:11.542
I never looked at very many dissertations.

00:31:12.345 --> 00:31:24.938
The only time I'd ever look at a dissertation was when the thesis and dissertation clerk had a problem that she couldn't solve with the chairman of the department.
