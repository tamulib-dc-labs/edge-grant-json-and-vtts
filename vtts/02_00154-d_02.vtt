WEBVTT

00:02.528 --> 00:31.894
In addition to the $800 compensation

00:02.528 --> 00:31.894
for eight weeks of work, we were provided a 
furnished apartment

00:02.528 --> 00:31.894
and could eat all of our meals at no charge in the 
campus dining hall Plus, any guests that we might

00:32.245 --> 00:55.603
have could stay at the, any visitors we might have 
could stay at the guest house, at the campus guest

00:32.245 --> 00:55.603
house, and also eat as our guests

00:32.245 --> 00:55.603
at the dining hall.

01:07.430 --> 01:11.435
As Joe's date of expectancy arrived, everything 
was in order. And on January 31, she gave birth to

01:13.538 --> 01:24.992
our first child,

01:13.538 --> 01:24.992
whom we quickly named Stephen Charles.

01:28.737 --> 01:35.445
Selecting the first of those titles from the 
biblical hero, And the second

01:37.315 --> 01:54.552
from Joe's

01:37.315 --> 01:54.552
very

01:37.315 --> 01:54.552
generously kind stepfather, Charles Edgar 
Davis.

01:57.815 --> 02:04.842
Mother and dad quickly drove out to see their first 
grandchild. and soon bought their first

02:06.526 --> 02:27.772
air-conditioned car so that they could help us 
move to our new college station address one month

02:06.526 --> 02:27.772
after, about a month after Stephen's birth.

02:33.700 --> 02:34.120
When that day came, Dad and I left Kerrville before 
daylight

02:34.690 --> 03:04.005
in the Ford Victoria

02:34.690 --> 03:04.005
and drove to Houston

02:34.690 --> 03:04.005
where he had left his pickup

02:34.690 --> 03:04.005
and a little trailer that we had made into a quote 
moving van by building a cover

03:04.272 --> 03:21.651
on what had once been the bed and pickup truck 
mounted onto a trailer rack. We rented a small

03:21.672 --> 03:33.705
trailer and attached it to the pickup

03:21.672 --> 03:33.705
and headed away from Houston

03:36.520 --> 03:44.592
At about dark.

03:44.612 --> 03:46.154
Near the 1st of September. Heavy rain fell on us all 
the way to Houston to College Station. And it took

03:52.965 --> 04:00.276
us more than 4 hours to make that drive.

04:00.296 --> 04:02.259
By the time we approached our new. Home.

04:09.190 --> 04:21.181
On the west side of Bryan at Cindy Lane, across 
Carson Street from what was then the

04:09.190 --> 04:21.181
International Shoe Factory, the rain had 
stopped.

04:24.444 --> 04:36.295
So he and I, wide awake with adrenaline, decided we 
would go ahead and unpack and unload all the stuff.

04:39.430 --> 05:08.037
By the time the new mother, grandmother, and child 
arrived the next afternoon,

04:39.430 --> 05:08.037
we had everything comparatively well organized,

04:39.430 --> 05:08.037
since the volume

04:39.430 --> 05:08.037
of material that Joe and I owned were 
comparatively modest. A notable absence in our

05:09.569 --> 05:39.222
furniture had been filled because Dad and I drove 
down to East Main Street in Bryan and found at the

05:09.569 --> 05:39.222
Craft Furniture Company a used vinyl-covered 
dinette table and four plastic-coated chairs for

05:09.569 --> 05:39.222
the sum of $29.95.

05:44.686 --> 05:45.327
Paragraph. As the year began at Nagel Hall.

05:53.436 --> 05:55.218
Once the home of civil engineering.

05:58.802 --> 06:02.146
Located facing north on just South. Of the G 
Raleigh white statue. And a short walk. Southeast

06:11.697 --> 06:14.220
of the academic building. I was assigned to the 
office of the full professor

06:16.411 --> 06:24.922
who was on leave for the year.

06:28.547 --> 06:42.486
That

06:28.547 --> 06:42.486
large and comparatively large and 
well-appointed office was indeed a blessing for a

06:28.547 --> 06:42.486
novice and it was located immediately adjacent to 
the office of the

06:44.356 --> 07:12.135
dean again paragraph again one of life's 
coincidences came into play because the new dean

06:44.356 --> 07:12.135
of arts and science of the school of arts and 
sciences for the agricultural mechanical

06:44.356 --> 07:12.135
college of texas was dr frank w.r hubert

07:17.009 --> 07:46.071
This is the same individual

07:17.009 --> 07:46.071
who had permitted me to become a member of the 
Bengal Lancers Boys Band as a seventh grader and

07:17.009 --> 07:46.071
who was, Dash, by the time I was a high school 
senior, the principal at Orange High School.

07:50.708 --> 08:19.534
He had been selected by the new A&M president, Earl 
Rutter,

07:50.708 --> 08:19.534
to come to College Station because President 
Rutter and a number of other deeply concerned

07:50.708 --> 08:19.534
Aggies wanted to try to create a stronger 
relationship between A&M

08:21.809 --> 08:26.715
and the high school leadership across the state of 
Texas.

08:30.479 --> 08:50.061
Dr. Hubert, a comparatively thin, blonde,

08:30.479 --> 08:50.061
and very articulate man, had grown up in Cameron, 
Texas

08:30.479 --> 08:50.061
and attended the University of Texas

08:52.522 --> 08:56.528
His career had been impacted very positively. By 
lecture start. From Orange. And also Doctor JW

09:02.678 --> 09:05.102
Edgar.

09:08.267 --> 09:11.512
The Superintendent of Schools in Orange during. 
The war years and later. The state Superintendent

09:16.339 --> 09:18.242
of Education.

09:21.682 --> 09:28.831
who was one of the key recommenders of Dr. Hubert 
for the A&M post.

09:33.296 --> 09:48.735
As my duties began in the history department, I 
learned that Dr. Nance was a

09:33.296 --> 09:48.735
very stubbornly and unyieldingly leader of the 
department.

09:56.372 --> 10:07.964
A stubbornly and unyieldingly

09:56.372 --> 10:07.964
determined leader of the department.

10:07.984 --> 10:16.832
He expected everyone to meet every class on time, 
to be dressed in a professional manner, and to be

10:19.343 --> 10:35.758
available for students

10:19.343 --> 10:35.758
in their offices during the normal eight to five 
working hours.

10:35.778 --> 10:48.270
Since I already had published two articles and a 
little book, and had two other articles

10:35.778 --> 10:48.270
forthcoming,

10:51.676 --> 11:02.193
My arrival in the department had been greeted with 
quiet approval.

11:08.103 --> 11:15.034
During the first few days of the fall semester, I 
noticed that a number of the group Walked over to

11:17.258 --> 11:23.644
the Memorial Student Center for coffee at mid 
morning.

11:27.868 --> 11:30.671
I very much wanted to be included in that group. But 
worried that it would might seem intrusive. If I

11:36.976 --> 11:39.519
invited myself to join that.

11:43.322 --> 11:43.563
Group. Thankfully. One morning, perhaps the 
second or maybe the third week,

11:46.925 --> 12:05.862
a new colleague opened my door and asked if I would 
like to join them, and I almost jumped from my

11:46.925 --> 12:05.862
chair.

12:18.076 --> 12:41.301
Before many days of coffee, I learned that Dr. 
Nance did not approve of there being a coffee pot in

12:18.076 --> 12:41.301
Nagel Hall and did not want anyone to make coffee in 
their own office because to him that was quote a

12:18.076 --> 12:41.301
waste of time. On the other hand, since he led the 
mid-morning and mid-afternoon walks to the MSC,

12:46.409 --> 13:04.395
he obviously did not think there was any waste in 
walking to the MSC.

13:04.415 --> 13:14.290
Those conversations ranged over every subject in 
the world, but quickly it became obvious that

13:15.046 --> 13:40.041
there was comparative cohesion in the department 
and that Dr. Nance was not the chairman guided by

13:15.046 --> 13:40.041
the will of the majority

13:15.046 --> 13:40.041
of the departmental faculty, but was in fact the 
department head who made the decisions

13:43.497 --> 13:52.930
that he thought were best for the department.

13:52.950 --> 14:03.145
Early that fall, at a school of arts and sciences 
faculty meeting, Dean Hubert spoke.

14:11.036 --> 14:13.099
And I thought that I noticed in his manner at the of 
the speech.

14:26.235 --> 14:41.415
I thought I noticed in his demeanor

14:26.235 --> 14:41.415
from the beginning through the end of the speech 
was very carefully guarded And filled with.

14:47.902 --> 14:48.382
Concern.

14:53.026 --> 14:55.408
He walked back to his office alone. In front of a 
number of us. And a few days later. He

15:01.614 --> 15:05.838
stepped into. My office. And ask what the group had 
thought about his remarks. When I told him that

15:13.053 --> 15:41.710
there was overwhelming approval and 
endorsement, he relaxed and indicated his deep

15:13.053 --> 15:41.710
concern about being received

15:13.053 --> 15:41.710
on the campus with acceptance and respect since he 
had not had, since his career had not yet included

15:42.280 --> 15:46.544
higher education faculty experience.

15:49.027 --> 16:09.707
Another speech during the fall struck all of us in a 
different manner as we went to hear the A&M

15:49.027 --> 16:09.707
president, Earl Rutter.

16:09.727 --> 16:12.270
His remarks

16:14.495 --> 16:40.300
which he read very carefully, left all of us 
shaking our heads with the

16:14.495 --> 16:40.300
evaluation that he was not a very good speech maker 
and did not seem to have a long experience in higher

16:14.495 --> 16:40.300
education.

16:43.840 --> 16:59.024
Further conversation indicated that President 
Rutter, known to one and all of his friends as Earl

16:43.840 --> 16:59.024
Rutter, had been born in the Texas Hill Country and 
grown up in Eden.

17:01.808 --> 17:11.603
After two years at what was then John Tarleton 
Agricultural College, he transferred to A&M and

17:01.808 --> 17:11.603
was a member of the class of 1931.

17:14.907 --> 17:19.632
A group that included many, many outstanding 
individuals. Including the then incumbent

17:20.594 --> 17:25.259
longtime incumbent congressman. From the Brazos 
County area, Olin E Tiger Teague Teague.

17:39.956 --> 17:40.517
Mr Rudder. Had. After completing his studies at 
A&M, met and married his wife, Margaret, from a

17:44.540 --> 17:54.432
ranching family near Brady. And they had settled 
where they settled, and he served as a high school

17:56.594 --> 18:11.833
teacher, coach, in addition to managing the Mrs. 
Rudder Ranch.

18:22.255 --> 18:23.597
When World War Two came.

18:29.165 --> 18:35.635
Mr Rudder had been called to active duty and served 
with true distinction.

18:39.361 --> 18:41.945
As an officer of the Army Rangers.

18:44.629 --> 18:45.450
Most notably. Leading a Ranger. Battalion. up the 
cliffs at Pointe du Hoc, P-O-I-N-T-E, D-U-H-O-C,

18:51.061 --> 19:05.895
the night before D-Day, June 6, 1941.

19:11.000 --> 19:17.406
In the fall of 1940, 1980,

19:11.000 --> 19:17.406
when I happened When I had the honor of meeting 
General Omar Bradley, commanding officer of all

19:19.580 --> 19:47.022
field forces, all American field forces in 
Western Europe in World War II, he looked up at me

19:19.580 --> 19:47.022
and asked if I was from A&M.

19:47.525 --> 19:50.508
positive response, he asked if I knew President 
Rudder.

19:53.291 --> 19:54.111
And I proudly.

19:57.955 --> 20:02.640
Answered told him that I had worked. With Mr Rudder 
on a number of points. As he continued, his voice

20:07.044 --> 20:08.946
broke. When he said in 40 quote in 48 years of 
command responsibility. I never gave a more awful

20:17.107 --> 20:28.104
order to any officer than the one I gave Earl the 
night before D-Day. Because if he and his men had

20:28.124 --> 20:44.329
not succeeded in climbing that cliff almost 200 
feet of sheer rocks and knocking out the German

20:28.124 --> 20:44.329
artillery hidden behind 12 feet of concrete, that 
overlooked both Omaha and Utah beaches. If they

20:50.985 --> 21:00.134
hadn't succeeded, we would have had a massacre,

20:50.985 --> 21:00.134
and the war might have turned out differently." 
Period, quote.

21:07.821 --> 21:14.788
But we faculty members' first impression of Mr. 
Rutter was that he was not an important an

21:15.022 --> 21:16.444
impressive speaker. Gradually, we realized that 
he didn't expect speaking to be his mark of

21:18.246 --> 21:43.459
distinction,

21:18.246 --> 21:43.459
nor

21:18.246 --> 21:43.459
did he worry about not having a PhD

21:18.246 --> 21:43.459
and a long record of scholarly research. Instead, 
he concentrated on leadership,

21:45.363 --> 22:11.674
which had begun soon after his return to Brady when 
a local group encouraged him to run for, to seek the

21:45.363 --> 22:11.674
position as mayor of that hill country town

21:45.363 --> 22:11.674
in 1946.

22:14.185 --> 22:42.572
The manner in which he handled that task in some 
fashion attracted the attention of Governor Alan

22:14.185 --> 22:42.572
Shivers a few years later, who appointed him as the 
interim land commissioner of Texas to clean up an

22:14.185 --> 22:42.572
awful mess

22:14.185 --> 22:42.572
in that office, which resulted in the 
imprisonment of Mr. Rutter's predecessor,

22:43.885 --> 22:47.851
Bascom Giles.

22:58.628 --> 23:10.045
As I look at the highway sign, we have just passed 
one that says, Welcome to Johnson City, the home of

22:58.628 --> 23:10.045
Lyndon B. Johnson.

23:17.720 --> 23:44.284
After Mr. Rutter did such a good job with the, in 
straightening out the land office,

23:17.720 --> 23:44.284
a group of individuals

23:17.720 --> 23:44.284
deeply concerned about Texas A&M identified him

23:17.720 --> 23:44.284
to, as the proper individual

23:46.711 --> 24:00.652
to take over the presidency

23:46.711 --> 24:00.652
of A&M and to lead the institution forward.

24:00.672 --> 24:15.013
Their concern had been caused by more

24:00.672 --> 24:15.013
than a decade of rapid turnover in the leadership 
on the campus.

24:17.373 --> 24:26.443
and the obvious lack of growth and progress there. 
Other Texas institutions were beginning to grow

24:26.464 --> 24:37.817
rapidly in enrollment and reputation, but A&M 
seemed to be standing still. So they brought this

24:40.340 --> 24:44.224
hill country

24:47.478 --> 24:53.587
rancher and quiet politician to take over the 
task.

24:56.251 --> 25:00.076
Paragraph.

25:00.096 --> 25:14.397
When we survivors of PhD programs had read his 
resume,

25:00.096 --> 25:14.397
we were not impressed because he didn't have a 
graduate record, had never been a post-secondary

25:16.368 --> 25:25.277
faculty member

25:16.368 --> 25:25.277
and was without research or publications.

25:28.120 --> 25:33.947
What we obviously overlooked was his leadership 
ability. Gradually, we accepted the fact that he

25:33.967 --> 25:44.738
identified himself as, quote, the pot-bellied 
Prexy.

25:47.671 --> 25:49.753
The latter part of which came from. His student 
days when the chief executive officer.

25:59.283 --> 26:04.708
Was identified in an area of Aggie nicknames as the 
proxy. Even the big light bulb.

26:13.917 --> 26:15.619
Which glowed above. the dome on the academic 
building was known as Praxis Moon, a favorite

26:16.173 --> 26:29.293
spring target for student sharpshooters.

26:36.284 --> 26:36.524
Mr. Rudder

26:36.584 --> 26:41.792
spent his time

26:44.776 --> 27:00.932
in organizational leadership

26:44.776 --> 27:00.932
and tireless work in behalf of the institution in 
Austin and Washington and other key governmental

26:44.776 --> 27:00.932
locations.

27:05.497 --> 27:13.365
Meanwhile, in the history department,

27:05.497 --> 27:13.365
we met classes. normally 50 to 50 or so per section 
because in that era there were no, none of the large

27:14.662 --> 27:36.564
sections of the introductory courses.

27:36.584 --> 27:42.610
Dr. Nance expected us to turn in a copy of all of our 
tests

27:45.610 --> 27:58.045
And grades of all students were posted publicly, 
including names, on our doors immediately after

27:45.610 --> 27:58.045
we finished grading final exams.

28:05.514 --> 28:09.238
That policy of review

28:11.615 --> 28:28.512
discouraged anyone from having either a high

28:11.615 --> 28:28.512
percentage of A's and B's or an unusually large 
number of failing marks.

28:34.057 --> 28:41.605
We all checked the roll

28:34.057 --> 28:41.605
and soon learned that the department head would 
back us in any disciplinary problem we might have.

28:48.681 --> 29:11.794
Yet, those difficulties were almost 
non-existent

28:48.681 --> 29:11.794
because Aggie fish were all in class, seldom 
without paying attention,

28:48.681 --> 29:11.794
and in corps uniform day after day.

29:20.498 --> 29:32.610
At the end of the first year, we were all evaluated, 
and I was pleased to get a comparatively favorable

29:20.498 --> 29:32.610
summation. But since that was the first year in the 
state's biennial appropriation

29:34.432 --> 29:49.948
period, there were no salary increases.

29:53.084 --> 30:09.365
for anyone, including those

29:53.084 --> 30:09.365
faculty members who were promoted for the coming 
year.

30:09.385 --> 30:16.775
My blessing, however, had come near

30:09.385 --> 30:16.775
the beginning of the spring semester.

30:19.839 --> 30:22.703
On that day, as I was picking up my mail in the 
departmental office down at the end of the hallway

30:23.020 --> 30:32.475
on the second floor of Nagel. Dr. Nance saw me and 
invited me into his office

30:34.158 --> 30:49.382
where he quickly

30:34.158 --> 30:49.382
mentioned, quote, John Hill

30:52.214 --> 30:54.457
Has just told me he's not coming back. He's staying 
at the University of Houston. He's going to. He's

30:59.023 --> 31:01.886
accepted a permanent position at the University 
of Houston. So you can stay here.

31:08.495 --> 31:20.710
And be a member of the department.

31:20.730 --> 31:21.411
Period quote. That night, I joyfully informed Jo 
of that good fortune, and she began to look for a

31:22.302 --> 31:35.479
house the next day.

31:38.843 --> 31:48.816
Within a few weeks, she found one at 410 Emerson, at 
503

31:38.843 --> 31:48.816
Bolton, B-O-L-T-O-N,

31:54.685 --> 32:00.113
in College Station

31:54.685 --> 32:00.113
east of the campus.

32:03.698 --> 32:24.186
It was a pleasant little frame house, about 1,600 
feet in size, with three bedrooms,

32:03.698 --> 32:24.186
a small double car garage,

32:03.698 --> 32:24.186
and enough room in the backyard for a garden.

32:27.068 --> 32:30.934
We moved there about the 1st of May, 1960.

32:35.740 --> 32:37.343
And began making payments.

32:40.467 --> 32:42.390
And began our monthly payments.

32:46.756 --> 32:47.898
Which started. Began making monthly payments, 
which started at $85. We had paid only the minimum

32:59.232 --> 33:19.722
down payment under the GI Bill

32:59.232 --> 33:19.722
and soon decided that we would start saving all the 
money we could for a, quote, dream house, which we

32:59.232 --> 33:19.722
might build in some future year.

33:23.548 --> 33:27.113
All around us in that pleasant setting, We're 
faculty. Young faculty members with small

33:30.897 --> 33:33.181
children. About like ourselves.

33:39.691 --> 33:44.779
And it was a. Splendid it was in hindsight. A. 
Glorious time.

33:53.113 --> 33:54.535
Nothing needed to be locked. Uh, there was no. 
Worry about breaking or entering.

34:07.307 --> 34:08.608
Our street safety. Or any other problem.

34:19.901 --> 34:20.702
I got to teach. Summer school. So that. our 
finances seemed very positive.

34:33.111 --> 34:49.902
Paragraph, meanwhile, I was continuing work on my 
dissertation,

34:33.111 --> 34:49.902
and that work came to a pleasant fruition

34:33.111 --> 34:49.902
the second year at A&M.

34:56.834 --> 35:23.112
As the time approached for the unyielding 
deadline date for all dissertations to be

34:56.834 --> 35:23.112
submitted by doctoral students who would 
graduate in the spring,

34:56.834 --> 35:23.112
I still lacked two chapters of my dissertation.

35:28.880 --> 35:30.882
Painfully and. Carefully, I wrote Doctor 
Vandiver letter. Telling him. My embarrassment.

35:43.674 --> 35:45.736
At not having finished those two chapters.

35:49.019 --> 35:50.821
I admitted my failure.

35:56.966 --> 35:57.587
To him. and that I had let down my wife

35:59.457 --> 36:12.894
and son and parents.

36:16.178 --> 36:28.654
When he received that note, he called me and said 
tersely, get down here as soon as you can. before he

36:29.984 --> 36:30.845
hung up.

36:34.990 --> 36:40.137
Frightened all the way, I drove to Houston, walked 
into his office. He came in and said very simply,

36:42.180 --> 36:54.996
get me those two chapters by the deadline in two 
weeks, or don't bother ever sending them.

36:58.672 --> 37:11.691
Needless to say, I came back

36:58.672 --> 37:11.691
and tried to build up confidence and 
determination.

37:15.636 --> 37:20.303
The first chapter became a reality within about a 
week.

37:23.327 --> 37:26.552
And then early the next week, At supper time, I told 
my bride that I would go back to the office and work

37:27.612 --> 37:34.001
on that chapter. When she asked when I would be 
home, I told her I did not know. Depend on how well I

37:39.848 --> 37:43.934
did that chapter. I started typing and somewhere 
about 2 o'clock in the morning completed it.

37:53.907 --> 37:56.050
Returned home and slept with relief. and sent the 
entire document to Dr. Vandiver,

37:58.308 --> 38:12.304
later realizing that the last chapter may have 
been about the best one that I had completed.

38:17.029 --> 38:25.699
Thus, in the spring of 61,

38:17.029 --> 38:25.699
that degree was officially completed,

38:28.413 --> 38:53.509
And we proudly walked away from the quietly 
traditional

38:28.413 --> 38:53.509
commencement held on the east side of

38:28.413 --> 38:53.509
the main building at Rice.

38:58.383 --> 39:16.000
Back at A&M,

38:58.383 --> 39:16.000
Dr. Nance had given me a second year of very 
positive review, and my salary increased from

38:58.383 --> 39:16.000
$550 to $700 a month.

39:24.869 --> 39:27.411
Meantime, I realized that my colleagues in the 
department were all

39:28.066 --> 39:41.606
very capable men.

39:41.626 --> 39:50.519
They took their teaching very seriously, were 
deeply concerned about students, and were

39:41.626 --> 39:50.519
helpful to each other.

39:55.407 --> 39:56.368
There were no eccentricities in terms of 
behavior,

39:58.593 --> 40:12.805
dress,

39:58.593 --> 40:12.805
or other events.

40:12.825 --> 40:19.051
This team included some

40:12.825 --> 40:19.051
notable personalities.

40:21.793 --> 40:27.638
Dr. Nance himself was a tireless researcher in 
Texas history.

40:31.516 --> 40:45.254
particularly in the period of the Republic of 
Texas, 1836,

40:31.516 --> 40:45.254
and the decade following Texas independence in 
1836. He

40:45.334 --> 41:01.354
had been working on a detailed study of the Mier 
expedition

40:45.334 --> 41:01.354
already for years, and that would continue 
literally up until his death, when it was

41:01.958 --> 41:20.737
completed

41:01.958 --> 41:20.737
with a manuscript of more than 2,000 pages 
submitted for publication.

41:20.757 --> 41:30.447
To his

41:20.757 --> 41:30.447
students, his students had given him the nickname 
Notes Nance. because of his classroom habit of

41:30.747 --> 41:43.080
relying heavily upon his notes and reading a large 
portion of his lectures from those pages.

41:45.762 --> 41:56.113
Other memorable individuals were Screamin'

41:45.762 --> 41:56.113
Al Nelson,

42:02.759 --> 42:25.780
Never forgotten by anyone, this specialist in 
Latin American history

42:02.759 --> 42:25.780
would regularly yell at his classes, 
particularly

42:02.759 --> 42:25.780
as a result of his worry

42:29.455 --> 42:33.099
About quote Democrats and other communist 
liberals.

42:36.383 --> 42:41.089
Quote who were going to ruin American democracy.

42:48.057 --> 42:49.338
Until I had a class. Session a class that met across 
the whole way from his. I did not understand why he

42:57.670 --> 43:00.334
Why he merited that nickname. But after. Hearing 
in those months. There was no doubt. About its

43:08.905 --> 43:10.146
appropriateness.

43:14.632 --> 43:17.476
The senior man in Southern history, my specialty. 
Was Horace Bass.

43:23.845 --> 43:26.428
Who seemed to his. Members of his classes to be 
short. In humor. An understanding and thus. He was

43:37.662 --> 43:39.224
red ass bass.

43:42.908 --> 43:43.869
Not far away. Was

43:43.929 --> 43:47.173
a. An Easterner.

43:53.660 --> 43:54.441
Lloyd Taylor a graduate of Lehigh University who 
impressed everyone with the his

43:55.585 --> 44:14.488
splendid appearance and the style of his dress.

44:17.671 --> 44:24.900
Among the first to wear button-down collars and 
ties of real distinction he was always Ivy League

44:25.572 --> 44:49.133
tailor

44:25.572 --> 44:49.133
since it was history paragraph since the 
department was history and government

44:52.403 --> 45:17.192
The senior man in Texas government was Gene 
Benton,

44:52.403 --> 45:17.192
who required all students to take their exams in 
blue books, then a standard practice at upscale

44:52.403 --> 45:17.192
institutions.

45:20.115 --> 45:20.976
So His pseudonym, so he earned the student 
pseudonym of Blue Book Benton.

45:36.758 --> 45:50.777
Others who quickly struck this new colleague by 
their care, ability, and thoughtfulness were

45:36.758 --> 45:50.777
Claude Hall, a University of Virginia product

45:52.377 --> 46:01.031
who specialized in American diplomatic history. 
Herbert Lang, a UT graduate in US diplomatic.

46:14.312 --> 46:19.380
John Duncan, quietly, courteously,

46:21.925 --> 46:28.233
and patiently

46:21.925 --> 46:28.233
concerned to the students.

46:38.765 --> 46:51.240
Another political science, another government 
colleague whose nickname

46:38.765 --> 46:51.240
seemed special was Jock Woods. who reportedly

46:53.498 --> 47:05.027
was inclined not to fail anyone, any athlete in his 
government classes.
