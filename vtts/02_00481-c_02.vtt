WEBVTT

00:01.583 --> 00:03.246
You were on active duty? You never got a leave? Not 
up to that time, no. For five years you didn't get

00:06.811 --> 00:08.474
any leave? Well... Even before you went overseas?

00:17.649 --> 00:25.802
Sure that I had, each year I had a week at a time, 
something like that, between, between Transfers

00:26.322 --> 00:29.526
of stations, you take a week off. Okay, now let's 
continue to make sure everything's working

00:29.847 --> 00:34.373
right. Let's continue, and you were talking about 
what it was like going to London. You were going to

00:40.642 --> 00:42.504
start talking about that then. Well, I got six 
nights, seven days rest from recuperative leave

00:44.026 --> 00:56.143
when I transferred from 777

00:44.026 --> 00:56.143
Field Artillery Battalion to 745 Battalion. and I 
flew over in a, I think there were four of us from

00:57.372 --> 01:09.286
this, from our core artillery flew over an old 
DC-3. They came down and picked us up on a dirt

01:10.667 --> 01:21.680
landing strip and flew us to London and it was all 
blackout. Of course the It was rest in that you

01:24.929 --> 01:27.852
didn't have to keep any hours. You could sleep as 
long as you wanted to, and you'd get up when you

01:27.932 --> 01:32.837
wanted to, and do what you wanted to.

01:36.100 --> 01:47.050
The Red Cross, the Salvation Army, and the Army, I 
guess, sponsored tours, guided tours.

01:49.793 --> 01:54.818
The English-speaking

01:49.793 --> 01:54.818
Union of London ran a tour that I went down. They 
took a bunch of us down to Canterbury Cathedral.

02:02.251 --> 02:03.252
Oh, that'd be interesting. It was an all-day trip. 
It was about 40, 50 miles down to Canterbury. And I

02:08.357 --> 02:17.187
got to meet the

02:08.357 --> 02:17.187
vicar there who was head of the Church of England.

02:20.210 --> 02:20.891
OK, let's continue. I forget his name, but he was a 
very, very inspiring person and of course he gave

02:25.392 --> 02:54.336
us a blessing meaning he said a prayer for us it was 
most most inspiring trip to see this great

02:25.392 --> 02:54.336
Cathedral and to meet the head of the Church of 
England which we think of it as Episcopal Church

02:25.392 --> 02:54.336
mother Episcopal Church Another trip, I took a 
boat trip up the Thames. I went through a bunch of

03:02.915 --> 03:04.357
their locks. Their industry uses barges to 
transport heavy equipment and bulk material like

03:05.779 --> 03:20.596
sacks of grain and this kind of thing. Was this 
right at the end of the war? Yeah, this was right at

03:22.359 --> 03:23.760
the end of the war. So they weren't being bombed 
anymore? Well, it was always all blackout at

03:25.687 --> 03:33.299
night, but there wasn't prolific bombing, let's 
just say it that way. Every once in a while? Every

03:35.082 --> 03:37.566
once in a while you'd hear a rocket or something? 
They probably were the V2s. You'd hear a big boom.

03:41.913 --> 03:46.319
But the V2s were a different thing. They were 
Hitler's secret enemy, I mean secret weapon.

03:53.918 --> 04:00.548
They would set them, guide them on a course and they 
would get their range by putting in so many ounces

03:53.918 --> 04:00.548
of alcohol in them. When we were in Belgium, they 
started bombing Liège, which was a great big

04:01.910 --> 04:17.152
American ordnance depot where they had fields and 
fields of trucks and guns. And the Germans picked

04:19.435 --> 04:23.301
it up and they started bombing with these flea 
bombs. The V2s, you mean, the buzz bombs? The V1 was

04:27.430 --> 04:37.488
buzz bombed, called buzz bombs, and the Germans 
called them flea bombs. They can't say fly bombs,

04:37.728 --> 04:44.781
and that's what they were trying to say, is fly 
bombs, buzz bombs. They called them flea bombs.

04:47.378 --> 04:53.705
But anyway, you'd hear the thing coming over, and 
it was backfiring or propelling itself. It made a

04:54.606 --> 04:57.589
putt, putt, putt, putt business sound.

05:00.292 --> 05:04.877
And when it stopped putting, you knew to get in your 
hole, because it's coming down. And if you were

05:05.438 --> 05:11.985
within 150, 200 yards of it, well, it'd get you. As 
long as you could hear them putting coming to you

05:12.404 --> 05:17.810
and going by, you'd say, oh, thank God that one went 
by. Or if you hear it coming and said, oh, Lord, let

05:18.711 --> 05:25.439
that one keep going, just talking to yourself. But 
when they stopped putting, it meant they were

05:27.181 --> 05:31.085
coming down. They didn't fly over 300

05:33.268 --> 05:38.614
or 400 yards high. and you could knock them down 
with anti-aircraft, and that's the way the

05:39.708 --> 05:46.856
Americans saved Antwerp, was knocking them down. 
They put enough artillery in, I mean,

05:47.176 --> 05:53.804
anti-aircraft artillery in there to just shoot 
them out of the sky, because they were vulnerable.

05:54.344 --> 05:59.350
They were a slow-flight thing, and very 
cumbersome. This looked like a big bomb with a very

05:59.370 --> 06:06.017
short, stubby wing

05:59.370 --> 06:06.017
on it. Flea bombs. Anyway, they... They were 
harassing London with them, and I'm sure two or

06:08.564 --> 06:16.114
three nights would fall and you'd hear them. How'd 
the English people treat you when you were there?

06:20.439 --> 06:21.300
Oh, very kindly. They were welcoming you with open 
arms. They looked on us as certainly helping them

06:24.124 --> 06:33.015
win the war, if not winning the war for them, 
because they whipped. They would beat down.

06:36.577 --> 06:41.003
London was, I don't know, 60% destroyed. And of 
course, all that did was really re-emphasize

06:42.524 --> 06:54.780
their desire to win the war. It gave them a real 
incentive to fight back. But without American

06:59.806 --> 07:01.768
help, they'd never made it. They just couldn't 
have made it. And I think at the, I went up in

07:05.905 --> 07:11.371
Scotland one time during this trip. Took a train up 
there. My forefathers came from Weems Castle,

07:14.715 --> 07:27.469
Scotland, which is across the Firth of Forth from 
Edinburgh. Just across the big bay there. They

07:29.692 --> 07:32.335
called them Firths. I went up there and my 
grandmother and my mother both wrote me to go up

07:34.947 --> 07:42.294
there and see the whole family. And so I caught the 
train, went up there, and

07:43.054 --> 07:54.705
did get to visit with some Scotsmen on the train. 
And one of them expressed to me that I was on that

07:56.526 --> 08:03.773
train the day that they announced the land lease 
was stopped, terminated. And this Scotsman,

08:10.695 --> 08:21.108
apparently he was a businessman, said that we 
certainly appreciated the land lease, but it had

08:10.695 --> 08:21.108
to come to an end sooner or later. And the sooner it 
comes to an end, the better for us. And he thought it

08:24.853 --> 08:30.120
had helped him tremendously, but the sooner we cut 
it off, the better. It'd get them back on their own

08:30.981 --> 08:32.663
feet. And so that was the attitude that I 
experienced.

08:39.411 --> 08:45.901
They tried to take advantage of you and did take 
advantage of you on prices and all. A bunch of us

08:47.163 --> 08:59.642
were out, been to a picture show, nothing else to 
do, and went to a picture show and had a few drinks,

08:47.163 --> 08:59.642
decided to go eat something before we went to 
sleep. It was 10, 30, 11 o'clock at night, and of

08:59.662 --> 09:02.346
course it was blackout. and went and two or three 
opened doors, and then inside there, they didn't

09:03.895 --> 09:17.507
have anything, and they'd say, go on down to about 
the fourth door there, and this is down around

09:03.895 --> 09:17.507
Trafalgar Square. Piccadilly, they called it. 
And we got down there and went down to the fourth

09:22.191 --> 09:32.940
door and started down, and a bunch of English girls 
were coming out. And I don't know, one of us asked

09:34.000 --> 09:37.365
them, we said, is there anything to eat down there? 
And they said, yeah, they got some food down there.

09:39.588 --> 09:40.509
So we went on down. And

09:41.931 --> 09:53.066
all they had was, I asked them for scrambled eggs 
and bacon, or scrambled eggs and ham or something,

09:41.931 --> 09:53.066
and hot biscuits. And they had the scrambled eggs, 
which were powdered, Lend-Lease eggs. They had

09:59.051 --> 10:04.679
some fried spam, which we went off and left a lot of 
times in combat. And they had some dried biscuits

10:05.740 --> 10:11.869
that they served us. And it charges three pounds 
per serving. My goodness. Which is about, then is

10:15.955 --> 10:19.721
about $6.50. So they took advantage of us. And 
after all, that old boy that served them had

10:22.304 --> 10:26.130
probably got them in the black market. And they 
were given to some English army unit as rations.

10:37.861 --> 10:44.630
And they found a way into the black market, into 
this cafe, downstairs cafe. And they charged six

10:45.271 --> 10:50.038
and a half a serving for them. Well, you don't know 
these things till after he brings it out there. You

10:54.123 --> 10:59.709
don't stop and ask for a price if Hungary's talking 
it out. You find a place you can buy something to

11:00.229 --> 11:07.918
eat, you buy it, and then cuss it when you leave 
there because they're taking advantage of you. So

11:07.938 --> 11:12.242
they would take advantage of you. But the people 
that you dealt with normally were very friendly

11:12.262 --> 11:17.768
people. Now, let's go back to the problem of 
refugees, which we started. Tell me about that

11:23.846 --> 11:24.728
again. Well, the refugees, or we call them DPs, 
displaced people, displaced persons, they have

11:24.828 --> 11:37.002
been used as slave labor. They were in a compound. 
They slept bunkered beds four or five high, jammed

11:38.944 --> 11:47.755
just as tight as you could jam them so that people 
could get through them, men and women intermixed,

11:48.376 --> 11:59.951
families intermixed, so that there was no 
privacy, no capability of privacy at all. It was

12:00.872 --> 12:08.021
just a existence, a bare existence, and they gave 
them enough food to give them energy to do the

12:00.872 --> 12:08.021
labor. If they weren't doing useful labor, well, 
they didn't get any food. It was just that simple.

12:17.332 --> 12:17.893
And

12:20.759 --> 12:25.183
These two, these, did you get the part about the two 
Dutch boys? No, we were just going, why don't you go

12:25.283 --> 12:27.625
ahead with that? Okay. Because that's where we 
noticed that there was something wrong. Okay,

12:30.228 --> 12:38.495
back in Germany, during combat, we were around 
Aachen, Gallenkirchen, in that part of Germany,

12:30.228 --> 12:38.495
just getting into Germany. We, we passed a town, 
and I guess it was part of the, the Dortmund

12:39.736 --> 12:45.561
complex. We were pretty close there, maybe ten 
miles from it. There was a Messerschmitt plant.

12:52.164 --> 12:59.430
And these two Dutch boys had been going to a 
vocational high school, which was a postgraduate

12:52.164 --> 12:59.430
high school. They'd been to normal high school in

12:59.450 --> 13:04.675
Amsterdam. And one of them was taking 
woodworking, and the other was taking accounting

13:04.695 --> 13:10.360
vocation. And their names were Case and Garrett. I 
don't know. That's the way you pronounce it

13:16.466 --> 13:18.087
anyway. both of them talked six or seven 
languages, which they have to in the normal

13:19.872 --> 13:45.238
business commercial world there, they learn 
this, because they'll be trading with a German in

13:19.872 --> 13:45.238
one minute, and an Englishman the next, and a 
Frenchman the next, and a Dutchman the next time,

13:19.872 --> 13:45.238
and so their education requirements are that they 
take every language spoken on the European

13:19.872 --> 13:45.238
continent, and these two boys have mastered 
including Russian and including the Slavic

13:46.231 --> 13:50.057
dialects. They were good

13:50.718 --> 13:57.047
translators. So I got the idea of relieving my... I 
had a German-born boy who was a sergeant in the

14:00.071 --> 14:03.376
American Army. He came over as a youngster with his 
family, Sergeant Anderson. And I used his

14:09.044 --> 14:13.150
interpreter, talking with Germans, and I used... 
him with these people until I got their

14:13.518 --> 14:21.250
confidence, until they got my confidence, let's 
say it that way.

14:21.270 --> 14:31.725
But I took them on thinking originally that I would 
put them down there and doing KP in the men's mess,

14:21.270 --> 14:31.725
relieve our soldiers of that sort. And all it cost 
was food, and so

14:33.308 --> 14:41.500
that was cheap. You didn't have to pay them any? No, 
no, we didn't pay them anything. We just took them

14:44.623 --> 14:47.607
under our care. Now they didn't want to go back to 
Amsterdam because they learned through their

14:48.328 --> 15:11.655
grapevine that the Dutch army was sending all 
able-bodied soldiers to the Dutch East Indies

14:48.328 --> 15:11.655
because they had an uprising out there and they 
were gathering all these people up, putting them

14:48.328 --> 15:11.655
in the army and sending them to suppress the 
troubles they had out in the Dutch East Indies.

15:11.956 --> 15:13.758
Those boys weren't interested in going home. They 
didn't want any part of that. And they knew that

15:16.141 --> 15:23.130
they could eat in my battalion, or they could eat in 
the American Army. And so they came in and

15:23.170 --> 15:26.794
convinced us that they wanted to work for the Army. 
And when I learned their language capabilities,

15:28.016 --> 15:34.544
well, I used them as interpreters, which are 
invaluable in these DP camps, for instance. We

15:36.146 --> 15:39.209
talked about the treatment of them in the DP camps. 
Did you give them a uniform? Give them clothing?

15:43.085 --> 15:43.846
Oh, no, no, no. When we go in, and that's the point 
I'm working up to, their contact or their

15:44.487 --> 15:55.022
resentment of the Germans and their association 
with the Germans is my interpreter. They needed

15:57.145 --> 15:58.647
some clothes. The clothes they had were ragged 
ass, worn out. And so we got in there, and I got the

16:03.133 --> 16:09.182
burgomaster in the first town after they came to 
us. and told him to get these boys some clothes. And

16:13.050 --> 16:20.717
the whole half hour, he came back and took the boys 
down to some clothing outfit. And he gave them a new

16:21.378 --> 16:27.943
suit, a half dozen shirts, clean underwear, and a 
new pair of shoes. And that's all there was to it.

16:30.846 --> 16:31.766
They didn't pay for them. But I didn't go, and so I 
didn't see that operation. I know they got the

16:38.212 --> 16:39.473
clothes. And everywhere we went, I'd tell him, go 
get the burgomaster. Come in and get him a

16:43.553 --> 16:51.063
typewriter or get him an overcoat or get him a pair 
of rain boots. And the burgomaster would show up

16:51.624 --> 16:56.751
with them and just give them to him.

17:00.036 --> 17:00.857
I took them on. I used them as interpreters in 
handling these DPs, which our basic

17:01.178 --> 17:10.050
responsibility was keeping them enclosed. 
keeping them from going over the country foraging

17:10.402 --> 17:21.093
and looting and burning and taking reprisals 
against the Germans, because that's what they

17:10.402 --> 17:21.093
wanted to do and tried to do. And very quickly, we 
got instructions from the higher command to stop

17:21.974 --> 17:34.307
that, which put an extra burden on our guards and 
all that kind of business. But that was just one of

17:34.327 --> 17:39.953
the chores that we had to contend with.

17:41.975 --> 17:47.202
Those two boys were invaluable to me as 
interpreters. And they, after I proved them out to

17:47.222 --> 17:55.614
my own satisfaction, I used them entirely. And 
they didn't have any compassion in getting

17:57.637 --> 18:02.023
information from the Germans. Can you give me some 
examples? Example? I tried to interrogate a

18:06.609 --> 18:10.294
German about something He wouldn't give me the 
information I wanted. And I'd get up and go out of

18:14.488 --> 18:15.769
the room. And when I came back, they had the 
information.

18:21.855 --> 18:28.802
They didn't have any compassions about physical 
contact with them, this kind of thing. I made it my

18:31.145 --> 18:38.692
job to not observe it, but that got the 
information. And I'm sure it was by physical

18:39.213 --> 18:41.395
contact. They stayed with me all the way down to 
Vienna, and then that's where I left them coming

18:42.370 --> 18:50.877
back this way. One time I took them on a trip down to 
Salzburg. I didn't want to see Salzburg. We were in

19:01.546 --> 19:09.733
a little town named Alt Town about 35 miles north of 
Salzburg. And I got the idea of buying my wife

19:13.792 --> 19:16.315
hand-embroidered blouse you'd see in the 
windows. Salzburg was a

19:17.137 --> 19:22.844
clothing center. They had some very elite shops 
there that had beautiful clothes in the show

19:22.864 --> 19:31.857
windows. I went in this shop and I told, Garrett was 
the boy, he was the older of the two, and he was doing

19:31.877 --> 19:39.908
the talking. Told him to find out if she had any, 
silk blouses and the white one. And she didn't

19:48.441 --> 19:51.925
respond. She didn't have any blouses. They had one 
in the window, and that was all there was to it. And

19:58.774 --> 20:02.580
of course, Garrett told me, she's lying, she's 
lying. She'd give them to us, and she'd get them.

20:05.924 --> 20:14.055
And so he took a paper box of matches, you know, what 
a paper full of matches is, and went over and got

20:14.356 --> 20:17.821
grabbed the drapery, started to set the drapery on 
fire. And she started screaming at him, come here,

20:17.841 --> 20:21.065
come here, come here. And she took him back in the 
storeroom and they brought out some beautiful

20:21.746 --> 20:25.992
blouses. But he wouldn't have had any compassion 
about setting that place on fire to get the point

20:27.174 --> 20:33.122
over. They just didn't give him any compromise. 
Because they'd been beat, been slaved, handled as

20:36.026 --> 20:42.034
a slave for four years. And these were good boys. 
They were good, intelligent boys. But he wouldn't

20:47.825 --> 20:55.113
hesitate about burning that place down just to get 
even with them, if that's a good way to put it. And

20:55.253 --> 20:59.077
this gal went in back in the back and got some boxes 
and came out. And she asked me what size, of course,

20:59.177 --> 21:04.603
talking through Garrett. And I couldn't tell her 
size, but I saw one about my wife's size. And I just

21:09.068 --> 21:11.751
said, I want to fit that woman there. She came up 
with it, and my wife still got it. It's a beautiful

21:14.537 --> 21:15.358
thing. All hand embroidered, and oh, it's a 
beautiful thing. And I think it cost me $78. I don't

21:22.267 --> 21:31.880
remember any marks and all this kind of business, 
but I just reflected it's $78, which is most

21:22.267 --> 21:31.880
reasonable. It was a very stylish thing, very 
stylish, and beautiful embroidery with flowers.

21:38.478 --> 21:43.124
Now what about Soviet or Russian refugees? There 
must have been some. There were lots of them, and

21:46.308 --> 21:53.637
they were the more militant of the refugees. As a 
matter of fact, I got the commander of the camp in

21:54.618 --> 22:07.354
our area one time, and he was sending out raiding 
parties at night time. And I got the commander, and

22:08.684 --> 22:21.901
again using Gary as my interpreter, told him very 
positively that this area was under martial law.

22:23.042 --> 22:25.185
Anything that moved at night was dead. I'd give my 
guards specific instructions that anything that

22:25.986 --> 22:31.333
moved after dark was dead. And I got the point over 
to him. He put out the word, and that stopped it in

22:36.325 --> 22:39.809
that particular area. But these Russians were 
just going on a foraging party, meaning they'd go

22:39.829 --> 22:46.156
out and burn. Just a reaction of liberty, I guess 
you'd call it. They'd been slave labor, and they'd

22:51.322 --> 23:00.312
been beaten and so abused that their only attitude 
was to get even. And they were the real

23:00.332 --> 23:02.434
troublemakers. What was their physical 
condition like? Their physical condition? Well,

23:09.451 --> 23:17.358
the ones that could do manual labor or skillful 
labor were fed and they were in pretty good shape.

23:17.898 --> 23:19.339
But the others were starving to death. If you 
didn't have some capability of performing a

23:21.301 --> 23:34.412
meaningful task, meaning working in whatever 
factory they put you in and do a proficient job,

23:21.301 --> 23:34.412
they'd starve you to death. And if you did, why, 
they gave you food, because they wanted your

23:35.607 --> 23:42.077
physical capability. So some of them you saw were 
in good shape, and some of them were in pitiful

23:44.220 --> 23:51.291
shape. Did you send them back to the Soviet Union? 
No, we kept them intact in this particular area,

23:54.295 --> 24:00.985
gave them groceries, and made them take care of 
themselves. And I'm sure I wasn't a part of it, but

24:03.552 --> 24:13.746
I'm sure they were eventually put on trains and 
sent back to Russia as soon as the G-5s got in. The

24:13.766 --> 24:21.316
G-5s is the military government end of the Army, 
like G-1, 2, 3, 4. The G-5 is the military

24:22.598 --> 24:27.064
government. And those are the people that came on 
and took charge of them after the combat troops

24:27.084 --> 24:33.272
went on by them. They put them through their 
classification interviews, meaning were they

24:34.180 --> 24:45.372
collaborators, were they Nazis, or this is what 
they were looking for. And they all proved out why.

24:48.235 --> 24:49.577
I'm sure they went back to Russia. They put them on 
trains and got rid of them as fast as they could to

24:49.597 --> 24:56.825
relieve us of the responsibility of feeding them. 
And that was the first responsibility.

25:04.859 --> 25:05.159
Oh. Now, your active duty ended in 1946, right 
after. In June of 46, if I remember. Right after

25:14.448 --> 25:21.996
this was your last job as chief of public works and 
utility, as far as the active duty was concerned.

25:23.517 --> 25:28.562
Before we go into your reserve duty, is there 
anything else that you'd like to talk about? Are

25:28.682 --> 25:31.225
there any other episodes, you think? After I left 
the US forces in Austria, up to

25:35.082 --> 25:46.893
heading home, and that's where I got command of the 
94th Division Artillery.

25:50.216 --> 25:50.497
Right.

25:55.742 --> 25:59.125
After you left Austria, okay, and where was that 
located, Germany? Yeah, Bad Abling. I got the

26:00.887 --> 26:01.968
order right here. Bad Abling. They had 
A-I-B-L-I-N-G, Germany, where I was

26:05.255 --> 26:23.939
put in command of the 94th Divorce Army, and here's 
where I assumed command on 18 December, 1945.

26:23.979 --> 26:27.724
That's when I took command of that. Why did they 
give you that command after the war was over? Well,

26:31.389 --> 26:34.333
this was a staging command of... keeping the first 
preservation of the equipment and keeping the

26:34.634 --> 26:45.847
soldiers busy until we could ship them home. That 
was our main chore of keeping them busy, getting

26:47.549 --> 27:04.489
them to rest camps, getting them back, 
categorizing them, meaning the high point people

26:47.549 --> 27:04.489
got home first, and

26:47.549 --> 27:04.489
general

27:06.612 --> 27:30.286
occupation duties, meaning traffic control and 
control of the local city government, meaning

27:06.612 --> 27:30.286
keeping your finger on the burgomaster to make him 
react to our peacetime approach to things rather

27:06.612 --> 27:30.286
than combat war. What about the denazification 
program? G5 people. Oh, okay. So you were not

27:38.028 --> 27:39.830
involved without that. Well, only in the effect of 
implementing it. If they had any troubles, we came

27:46.238 --> 27:48.260
in. But basically, the military government 
people came in and set themselves as a supervisor

27:49.121 --> 27:57.731
of the civilian population and government. And 
all we did, we did traffic control work, we did...

28:04.932 --> 28:17.748
security work, and there were still pockets of 
German, me and an isolated German that resented

28:04.932 --> 28:17.748
us, and he would take a pot shot at an American down 
in the end or throw a hand grenade out of a window at

28:04.932 --> 28:17.748
nighttime or something like that. Even in 1946? 
Even in 1946, that's right. And there's where we

28:22.454 --> 28:24.437
came into that. When that happened, well, we moved 
in and we tried to get, put a finger on it. But Our

28:33.181 --> 28:43.177
whole job then was occupation

28:33.181 --> 28:43.177
and keeping our people busy, keeping our soldiers 
busy. Sponsoring competitions and ball games and

28:43.818 --> 28:50.288
this kind of thing. Now you must have had a heck of a 
lot of points. And you must have been one, since

28:53.774 --> 28:57.720
you've been in since 1940, you must have been one 
very high on being able to go back to the States. Why

29:01.776 --> 29:04.399
weren't you sent immediately home? Well, that's 
another interesting story. And that's one of

29:06.441 --> 29:14.030
those things that I tried to buck and couldn't 
accomplish. I did have more points than anybody in

29:14.050 --> 29:17.534
the battalion. I should have been number one on the 
list to come home after the combat after VE day. And

29:24.101 --> 29:26.644
they had us set up to go through the

29:31.518 --> 29:52.870
Japanese island deal, and then VJ Day caught us, 
and I went down to the 2 Corps, which is

29:31.518 --> 29:52.870
headquarters in Salzburg, to see the G2 as a 
personnel officer, two-star general. I went down

29:52.890 --> 29:54.072
there, I'm going home. I'm going to get out of this 
man's army and go make some money. And he said, I

29:58.400 --> 30:00.882
don't have anything on you, kid. You got a job. Just 
keep on doing like you are. And he gave me that for a

30:04.746 --> 30:06.187
month. And I kept making a nuisance of myself, 
thinking that the squeaky wheel would get the

30:07.208 --> 30:11.432
grease. And I passed him in the hall one day. And he 
said, come in here, kid. Well, I saw something on

30:16.396 --> 30:17.978
you yesterday. And he looked through his desk, 
worst looking mind, and gave it to me. Here it is.

30:24.644 --> 30:25.825
You're going to Vienna tomorrow. I said, oh, 
General, there's something wrong. There's a

30:31.284 --> 30:32.866
misunderstanding here somewhere. He looked over 
his eyes and glanced at me and said, yeah, kid,

30:33.687 --> 30:40.094
well, you have something that's wrong. You're 
going to Vienna tomorrow. You're not going home.

30:44.179 --> 30:57.094
And he told me, and of course, I don't believe him to 
this day, that I was the only civil engineer

30:44.179 --> 30:57.094
officer, lieutenant colonel,

30:57.530 --> 30:58.331
The II Corps. II Corps was

31:00.936 --> 31:06.666
all the western half of Austria. Went all the way 
down to Glens, which is probably the big half, 60%

31:06.966 --> 31:15.040
of Austria, were the soldiers in II Corps. And I 
know, in my own mind, I wasn't the only civil

31:16.543 --> 31:23.014
engineer lieutenant colonel.

31:28.664 --> 31:34.049
running through the 66-1, which is your personnel 
card. And that shows your qualifications. And I

31:38.112 --> 31:41.495
was the first one that this warrant officer was 
going through the card looking for one. Came on it,

31:42.696 --> 31:45.058
and he said, here he is, General. Write the order. 
And that's it. And of course, I told General

31:48.381 --> 31:52.745
McMahon, that's something bad wrong here, 
General. He said, yep, Kidwell, that's right. You

31:54.446 --> 31:55.027
were wrong. You're going to be here tomorrow. And 
of course, All I could do was be a good soldier and

31:59.680 --> 32:01.102
go. And I thoroughly enjoyed it. It was well worth 
the seven, eight months I was down there. Because

32:11.418 --> 32:15.964
Austria is a beautiful country, and I've made a lot 
of good acquaintances there. I saw some gorgeous

32:16.064 --> 32:18.889
country, and I accomplished something. We got the 
power plants running to some degree. We got juice

32:23.896 --> 32:29.164
back into the major cities and some of the little 
country towns. So I felt that I accomplished

32:29.836 --> 32:32.120
something. So I don't regret it. It just took six, 
seven, eight months more of my life away and I'm

32:34.744 --> 32:42.236
nothing worse for it I guess. Okay, then after that 
you went up to the company commander or the CO of the

32:42.256 --> 32:49.308
94th Artillery? Division Artillery, right. And 
you were there until July? 1946. Right. June of

32:57.597 --> 32:59.699
1946. At

33:00.240 --> 33:08.189
about that time you were promoted to full colonel, 
weren't you? Excuse me, please. Now let's

33:09.770 --> 33:12.974
continue on your promotion of colonel. Okay. I was 
promoted when I was in the 94th the colonel,

33:20.782 --> 33:22.865
somewhere in there. I cannot get the exact date

33:23.706 --> 33:39.226
of it. On 10 February 1946, I was promoted to 
chicken colonel, full colonel.

33:51.494 --> 33:57.780
And then I retired in June, I believe.

34:08.051 --> 34:09.452
Now, why were you promoted? Because of your 
record, obviously. Because of my record and my

34:11.274 --> 34:21.484
longevity and my Army education and 
qualifications.

34:22.257 --> 34:29.568
And actually, the Departee

34:22.257 --> 34:29.568
Command job is the Brigadier General's job. And 
there I was doing it as Lieutenant Colonel. And the

34:33.834 --> 34:49.378
CG, as soon as I impressed on him that I knew what I 
was doing and got about doing his job and didn't

34:33.834 --> 34:49.378
give him any problems, he was kind enough to 
recommend me for a motion. I got it. Great. Purely

34:51.147 --> 34:53.830
and simply, I impressed him. And it was

34:53.990 --> 35:00.558
within his, well, it was his responsibility. He's 
supposed to do that. And the TO job was there. I

35:06.024 --> 35:07.366
mean, table of organization. I was holding a 
brigadier general's job. And all he could do was

35:10.910 --> 35:13.533
promote me to colonel. And a commanding general. 
Was he a two star? Oh, yeah, he was two-star

35:16.477 --> 35:17.798
general. I forget who it was. Oh, his name was 
General Anderson. I remember that now. He was, I

35:22.743 --> 35:28.449
don't remember his first name, but he was major 
general. And how long did you stay in that post?

35:30.671 --> 35:36.297
Well, until I got home, and I actually brought the 
94th Division artillery home. Oh, yeah, you

35:36.577 --> 35:38.079
brought it home with you. Brought it home, and we 
dispersed up at Camp Kilmer, New York, and... I

35:47.797 --> 35:50.880
always went scattered like a covered quail. Now, 
were you happy to get out of active duty, or did you

35:50.900 --> 35:58.028
think as a full colonel that maybe you might want to 
stay in the service? I had innumerable

35:59.170 --> 36:07.198
high-ranking good friends encourage me to stay in 
service. And as a full colonel, I could have done

36:09.461 --> 36:15.347
very well, I'm sure. On the other hand, the Army 
that I had seen up until that time was not conducive

36:18.998 --> 36:26.506
to the life I wanted to live. Meaning, I think in the 
first three years of our life in the Army, from

36:27.928 --> 36:48.870
December of 40, when I went in until I shipped 
overseas, I was moved 13

36:27.928 --> 36:48.870
or 14 times

36:51.955 --> 37:01.049
And of course, moving like that, you become a 
gypsy, meaning you don't have any place to plant

36:51.955 --> 37:01.049
your roots. Housing is hell around an army camp. 
And I didn't have enough seniority to get quarters

37:06.658 --> 37:13.609
on the post or being a new man. If I was a lieutenant 
colonel, I was still at the bottom of the totem pole

37:13.629 --> 37:20.359
because people ahead of me to get them. And we were 
living in rooms that, frankly, bear existence.

37:31.329 --> 37:45.305
And some places, Fort Meade, for instance, I got 
home on Saturday night every other week if there

37:31.329 --> 37:45.305
wasn't anything important going on. Otherwise, I 
skipped two more weeks.

37:52.874 --> 37:57.941
I couldn't project myself wanting that kind of 
life for 30 years. And I had the pressure put on me by

37:59.764 --> 38:05.692
a lot of high-ranking people to stay in. What a good 
life it would be and all that kind of business. On

38:10.259 --> 38:15.406
the other hand, I had a civil engineering 
education, and I wanted to get back and start

38:10.259 --> 38:15.406
making some money. And there's two ends of the 
pendulum. And I had to make a decision, and I

38:23.536 --> 38:33.729
decided to get out, stay in reserves, and stay

38:23.536 --> 38:33.729
qualified. Now let's talk about the reserves. 
Let's talk about the very first assignment you

38:36.573 --> 38:39.136
had. You came back to Dallas, right? And then you 
decided to- OK, I got to change files here now,

38:41.779 --> 38:47.567
because I'm not ETO. This is where I separated New 
York. Now I get the next file here.

38:56.982 --> 39:26.263
Okay, we came back to Dallas, and I got in touch with 
the local reserve people, or TMD they called it,

38:56.982 --> 39:26.263
Texas Military District people, and they 
assigned me to, I

38:56.982 --> 39:26.263
believe it was a core artillery,

39:29.095 --> 39:30.357
I'll find it in a minute here. You were the 
executive officer of the 90th Infantry Division

39:31.017 --> 39:41.450
Artillery, according to the secret.

39:41.470 --> 39:42.612
Well, okay.

39:47.438 --> 39:48.179
That's correct. I was assigned to the 9th Division 
Artillery, Headquarters and Headquarters

39:48.940 --> 39:58.832
Battery. as executive officer.

40:07.215 --> 40:23.590
And I stayed there for,

40:07.215 --> 40:23.590
Colonel John Mayo was the, was the

40:07.215 --> 40:23.590
commanding officer.

40:27.493 --> 40:29.595
And what were your functions as VXO? As the 
executive officer, I... I know what you do as the

40:32.735 --> 40:35.719
executive, but I mean, that wasn't a good 
question. I meant, what did the division do? It's a

40:38.462 --> 40:40.645
training division. Okay. In other words... 
Located here in Dallas? The headquarters is

40:44.050 --> 40:57.928
located here in Dallas, and they had a battalion in 
Amarillo and a battalion in College Station, a

40:44.050 --> 40:57.928
battalion in San Antonio, a battalion in 
Beaumont,

41:01.452 --> 41:02.673
Those poor battalions. And our function was to 
train the enlisted

41:03.854 --> 41:21.170
recruits to be proficient in their job as a 
reservist. Now, they could beat the draft by

41:22.071 --> 41:29.518
joining a reserve unit. That was an incentive to 
join a reserve unit, actually. And we took a man

41:34.259 --> 41:44.689
when he got to be 18 or just before he got drafted, 
he'd come join a reserve unit to beat it. They got an

41:45.169 --> 41:53.037
advance notice of a couple of weeks or something 
like that that they were going to be drafted on some

41:45.169 --> 41:53.037
date two weeks from now. And if they joined a unit 
while they didn't get drafted, the draft board

41:53.057 --> 41:56.400
would accept them. What did that mean for the 
quality of soldiers enlisted in the mountain?

42:01.818 --> 42:13.714
Well, of course, that was across the board at that 
time, meaning you got your share of high school

42:01.818 --> 42:13.714
dropouts, you got your share of high school 
students, you got your share of high school

42:01.818 --> 42:13.714
graduates, and you got your share of college 
graduates. Not graduates, but college students.

42:19.181 --> 42:23.687
So you got a cross-section of American life and... 
We had some mighty good men. Well, of course, some

42:26.536 --> 42:38.560
of them would be very good, but was there sort of a, 
if they're, part of the reason they're joining is

42:26.536 --> 42:38.560
to avoid the draft, were they in some respects 
anti-military? No, no, no, no, no, no. They

42:41.015 --> 42:50.846
weren't taking exemptions by claiming 4F, for 
instance, if they have physical disability or

42:41.015 --> 42:50.846
religious scruples or something like that. They 
wanted to continue their pursuit of education or

42:50.926 --> 42:56.332
their job or something. And the law said that they 
could join a reserve unit or National Guard and

42:57.113 --> 43:07.124
fulfill their military obligation. And so... 
they had the option of joining a reserve unit or

43:09.213 --> 43:13.379
being drafted. Now, the powerful incentive is to 
join a reserve unit, but some of them did, some of

43:14.821 --> 43:22.453
them didn't. But they made good soldiers. They 
eagerly learned, and it was a training mission for

43:23.935 --> 43:29.243
us. We went to active duty two weeks every year, 
either at Fort Sill or down at Fort Sam Houston out

43:29.383 --> 43:38.376
at Camp Bullis to do our firing.

43:40.330 --> 43:47.557
The last three years, as I remember, we went to Fort 
Hood, where we could use air range up there. And I'd

43:48.658 --> 43:56.545
been CO of the 9th Divardy. I believe it was after 
the end of my second camp with them, I got the idea of

43:57.706 --> 44:09.477
setting our goals to be combat proficient. 
meaning that each battalion had to pass the

44:10.672 --> 44:32.478
basic battalion test, combat proficiency test, 
that every unit that went to combat overseas had to

44:10.672 --> 44:32.478
pass before they were certified combat 
proficient.

44:34.660 --> 44:37.183
Isn't that quite a demand to make on reservists? 
Well, no more so than that. a normal army unit. I've

44:46.588 --> 44:52.535
set my heart and mind of making the 90th and Duvarty 
equal to any regular army unit. And I did. The first

44:55.739 --> 45:03.829
year, two of my four battalions passed the combat 
proficiency test. That was Colonel Coconose and

45:03.849 --> 45:07.594
Colonel Butler's battalion. Both of them became 
generals. That's right. And this is part of the

45:11.930 --> 45:13.732
reason why.

45:17.755 --> 45:18.776
That was the third year. The fourth year I was 
commander, three of the units passed. And my last

45:24.642 --> 45:38.374
year, all four of my units passed, which means my 
battalion could have been certified by a testing

45:24.642 --> 45:38.374
team, an army testing team, as proficient to go 
into combat. And that's the ultimate of training.

45:45.662 --> 45:52.331
General Rudder just told me I was pipe dreaming 
when I told him what my long-range plans were. But

45:53.513 --> 46:03.867
he couldn't have been more pleased when we passed 
with all four battalions my last year. And to me,

46:05.809 --> 46:07.011
that was... the ultimate of training.

46:13.287 --> 46:14.748
That's a real accomplishment. Really, it was. It 
was a lot of work. Certainly, I couldn't have done

46:17.190 --> 46:25.918
it without superior battalion commanders and 
superior battery commanders. Let's talk about a

46:27.579 --> 46:28.880
couple of those. Tell me about Kokonos and Butler. 
Well, they were outstanding gentlemen. They were

46:34.385 --> 46:37.588
top flight. unit commanders, they were 
enthusiastic with their work, and they were

46:38.699 --> 46:53.853
experienced and capable leaders, and they got the 
job done. And as I remember, and I know in both of

46:54.954 --> 47:08.706
their reports, their efficiency reports, I had to 
turn in on them once a year, I ended up my narrative
