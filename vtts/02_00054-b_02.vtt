WEBVTT

00:02.258 --> 00:04.621
Describe now as a junior.

00:04.801 --> 00:05.622
Okay, junior.

00:05.642 --> 00:09.186
First time to really... Describe your routine.

00:10.307 --> 00:17.095
First sergeant, the one who's really in charge of getting the fish in shape, teaching them.

00:17.155 --> 00:21.440
To me, my job was to teach them about being an Aggie and the traditions.

00:22.801 --> 00:27.106
The Jody's, the marching, how to keep their room.

00:27.126 --> 00:32.232
And I had a lot of great classmates, of course, that held other positions that

00:32.549 --> 00:40.378
like a right arm to me, but it was a real position of leadership, I would say, and the one I enjoyed the most.

00:40.418 --> 00:44.583
I'd rather have been first sergeant than to be on course staff.

00:44.663 --> 01:00.902
I mean, I was just more of the people person rather than a staff person, and so, again, I could yell at people, I could get on to them, I could chew them out, make them feel

01:01.827 --> 01:03.489
You know, like they weren't worth anything.

01:03.549 --> 01:04.491
You didn't build them up.

01:05.252 --> 01:10.478
But it wasn't my nature to be that way, in essence.

01:10.919 --> 01:16.326
But that's the way I became and worked with them and didn't back down from that.

01:16.366 --> 01:19.330
Real strong about doing what was right.

01:19.410 --> 01:21.393
Just being Aggie would make us proud.

01:22.054 --> 01:27.361
And so calling the Jody's, the formations, I loved all of that part of it.

01:27.381 --> 01:29.083
The aspect of that was my favorite part.

01:29.789 --> 01:32.774
of being a junior and first sergeant.

01:33.535 --> 01:43.112
Did you have any self-imposed guidelines about behavior in your outfit, about paddles and anything else?

01:44.094 --> 01:49.022
No, I've never, not as far as hazing goes.

01:49.102 --> 01:54.852
I didn't try to restrict that or I trusted the people that I

01:55.287 --> 01:58.913
that I had grown up with there in two years to do what was right.

01:59.754 --> 02:03.420
And know that their intentions were really for that other person's good.

02:03.440 --> 02:05.663
I never had a problem with that.

02:07.085 --> 02:12.974
Right now, in terms of routine, did you have to get up earlier and so forth?

02:13.535 --> 02:14.757
Every formation, of course.

02:15.078 --> 02:15.959
You have to be there.

02:15.999 --> 02:20.586
You're the one that's got to get them lined up, ready to go for when the commander comes out.

02:21.038 --> 02:26.225
to march him to chow and he just comes out the last minute and everything's supposed to be taken care of.

02:26.285 --> 02:41.325
So, as first sergeant, that's kind of the top kick of the outfit as far as being responsible for everything being done right and keeping up with their grades and all that kind of stuff was a big part of it.

02:41.542 --> 02:42.763
And I enjoyed that.

02:42.783 --> 02:47.088
I enjoyed that one-on-one and leading people.

02:47.228 --> 02:53.134
All right, then, when did a Yale leader have to go do some other things?

02:53.154 --> 02:54.295
Yes, well, a lot.

02:54.495 --> 03:09.270
And if it was a ball game, like, or court trips or something, I would always march with the outfield and call the Jodeys and the Yales on the way to the cow field and enjoyed that.

03:10.246 --> 03:31.497
So I'd go to march around Kyle Field with the outfit and then run under the Kyle Field Stadium into a little locker room area and have my whites there for my yellow to put that on and then go back out and get rev and start the... Where did y'all get your whites?

03:31.938 --> 03:32.779
Did you buy them?

03:32.799 --> 03:33.059
Lupo's.

03:33.500 --> 03:34.521
Lupo's?

03:34.541 --> 03:35.663
Have any idea what they cost?

03:35.997 --> 03:50.797
I do not, and old Army Lou was good about even helping Yale leaders a lot, and so, you know, he might give us one of our uniforms every once in a while.

03:50.817 --> 03:55.463
We just had a couple of sets is all we had, and we wore white tennis shoes then.

03:55.503 --> 03:57.846
They wear maroon now, but back then we wore white.

03:59.208 --> 04:02.072
Everybody had the same thing on, even the civilian.

04:02.474 --> 04:27.165
uh yell leader too and uh and so it's short hold up our sleeves yeah do you remember any games in which it was really cold oh yes yes there were some uh i can't remember who we were playing but i know even uh up in arkansas it could get pretty cold up there at one of those razorback games but but we even in the coldest

04:27.685 --> 04:30.529
weather or raining, we wouldn't wear a yellow sweater.

04:30.549 --> 04:34.295
We had yellow sweater, but we didn't wear them while we were on the field.

04:34.916 --> 04:41.966
Now, was it okay when you were not on the field to come up and put a coat on?

04:42.727 --> 04:43.428
We never did.

04:43.448 --> 04:44.029
Is that right?

04:44.109 --> 04:46.973
I don't know if it was okay or not, but we just never did.

04:48.876 --> 04:53.743
Were there any yells used then that we don't use now that you can think of?

04:54.871 --> 04:57.896
No, but we did a lot more.

04:58.176 --> 05:00.740
We yelled a lot more often than they do now.

05:01.001 --> 05:04.706
The same yells, but former Spite was done several times during a ball game.

05:05.408 --> 05:10.556
And basketball games, which they might, it seems to me like they just do three or four yells now.

05:10.876 --> 05:13.380
It's really aggravating to me some of that.

05:13.400 --> 05:14.261
That's a different story.

05:14.502 --> 05:17.166
To every football game and every basketball game.

05:17.146 --> 05:21.174
How did y'all get to the out-of-town games?

05:21.394 --> 05:24.700
Okay, and I'll say to every footballer, let me back up there.

05:25.722 --> 05:32.616
Back then, we didn't have the money they do now or the support that they have from other organizations helping them out.

05:33.578 --> 05:38.547
But we would go to every, of course, definitely every home game and every Southwest Conference game.

05:39.235 --> 05:44.623
The brothers, and we'd go to LSU, and just have to get there the best way we could.

05:47.308 --> 05:53.758
But our senior year, I might jump in too far ahead, we went to USC.

05:54.399 --> 06:03.072
But only two of us got to go, just because of Lincoln and the Woodrow Poo, rolled with the ball team.

06:03.953 --> 06:07.639
But for these other out-of-town games,

06:08.075 --> 06:09.196
You got there on your own.

06:09.336 --> 06:09.677
That's right.

06:09.697 --> 06:11.739
How'd you get in the stadium?

06:11.759 --> 06:14.462
Well, we didn't have passes or anything.

06:14.482 --> 06:17.906
We'd just, white uniform, we'd just tell them.

06:17.926 --> 06:18.647
We'd yell at her.

06:18.667 --> 06:20.589
We never seemed to have a... No trouble.

06:21.109 --> 06:23.392
Nobody ever stopped us.

06:23.592 --> 06:27.156
Surely there must have been some good, unique stories.

06:27.416 --> 06:29.198
Well... Share some of those.

06:29.218 --> 06:29.519
Okay, okay.

06:29.599 --> 06:33.463
Well, I guess one of them that got some notoriety.

06:33.503 --> 06:35.365
We were...

06:36.728 --> 07:05.993
When we played Arkansas, one of them was a home game against Arkansas back in those days, like I say, in all my four years, we didn't win as many games as they do in one year now, as far as outscoring the opponents, but we were playing Arkansas here, and they were one of the top ranked teams in the country back in those days, and we just had 8,000 students, and didn't have all the double decking and all, but we stopped the Arkansas game for about 10 minutes because

07:06.479 --> 07:12.249
of the crowd being so loud, and it was unbelievably loud.

07:12.269 --> 07:23.268
I mean, it was, and the refs had to come over and finally threaten us and all, and we got several letters to the editor on that.

07:24.130 --> 07:25.011
I received several

07:25.379 --> 07:35.379
calls or letters from old ags about that wasn't the best thing to do at the time, but Rudder, he never complained to me.

07:35.619 --> 07:43.856
I know he got a lot of complaints, and I still have a letter that he wrote me regarding that, but it wasn't like he was chewing me out.

07:43.876 --> 07:47.623
He was just relaying to me what they had said and that we shouldn't

07:48.616 --> 07:53.003
We should have cut it off sooner or something of that nature.

07:53.784 --> 07:58.351
Any good stories you remember about when you got thrown in the fish pond?

07:59.273 --> 08:00.214
Okay, yes.

08:00.274 --> 08:13.635
Just typical stuff of how they would chase you down and tackle it just like they do now and carry you all the way over and they'd be gouging you all the way and throw you in.

08:13.655 --> 08:16.800
I guess the funniest thing would be different from some of the stories you've heard is that

08:17.422 --> 08:19.985
My senior year, we never won a home game.

08:20.806 --> 08:33.603
Never won a home game, so we never got thrown in the fish pond my senior year, except we played SMU at Dallas in the Cotton Bowl, and that was the only game we won all year.

08:33.663 --> 08:41.893
At the game, two of my friends that lived across the railroad track from me in New Boston, two girls,

08:46.160 --> 08:50.224
but they were at the game sitting at two different places down the aisle.

08:51.105 --> 09:03.118
And so in the Dallas Morning News the next day they told this story because after the score I would leap over the rail, run up 23 flights of stairs, and I'd kiss both of them.

09:03.138 --> 09:12.188
And so the next day in the paper there was a big story about the jail leader going up two flights and kissing two girls.

09:12.669 --> 09:13.990
But we came back home

09:14.493 --> 09:21.423
Like I say, on Tuesday nights back in those days, we had yell practice after chow, great time.

09:21.864 --> 09:32.439
Well, after yell practice on that Tuesday night, all the fish got me, got the yell eaters and took us to the fish pond and threw us in then with our senior boots on and everything.

09:32.519 --> 09:42.694
So we were in uniform and so that was kind of a different story, a different slant on, we, of course it was my,

09:43.096 --> 09:55.489
junior year here when we were playing the Sips and they were the number one team in the nation and we just won two or three games and we were on Turkey Day and we were outscoring.

09:55.509 --> 10:03.337
They were supposed to beat us 30, 40 points, I mean, and we were ahead of them 13 to nine.

10:03.357 --> 10:12.546
And we intercepted the ball and fumbled, they got it back, they threw a ball in the end zone, the gym,

10:13.758 --> 10:22.188
Winnenberg, Jim Winnenberg, intercepted, caught, turned around, fell down, and scooted out of the end zone.

10:23.069 --> 10:30.278
And the refs caught him out of bounds, and every replay and every photo showed he was two or three yards in bounds.

10:30.298 --> 10:36.945
It was Hank Foberg, our coach, called it the most injustice that any team he'd ever been involved with.

10:37.526 --> 10:38.247
It was

10:38.648 --> 10:41.952
I mean, we, that would have sensed if we would have won the ball game.

10:41.992 --> 10:57.849
They went on down, because of that call, went on and scored with about a minute to go and went up 15 to 13, and the headlines in the paper the next day said, Ags 13, Sips 9, refs 6.

10:57.869 --> 11:05.297
And, but more than that, and which some of these young Ags don't understand why, that we,

11:07.268 --> 11:37.039
hate is a strong word, but I'd have to say why we hate the T-Sips so, and I've got a lot of Longhorn friends, and not every individual, but I'm saying the old wall philosophy of that school is different than Texas A&M, and we don't like it, and one of the things that ingrained that in my mind was after that game, as Aggies always do, when we get outscored, we were having our yell practice, and I mean, tears were streaming down my eyes, because I mean, we had beat the national champs in reality,

11:37.694 --> 11:42.842
And these Longhorns were walking on the track between me and the students.

11:44.765 --> 12:00.630
And just a foot away, I'll never forget this guy and his date, just stopped right in front of me while we were doing the yells, singing the war hymn, and hooking horns right in my face, and just laughing out loud at us.

12:00.897 --> 12:06.446
My son said, Dad, why didn't you call the cadets out of the stands and bought me?

12:06.466 --> 12:09.391
And that might be one of my biggest regrets of all time.

12:10.012 --> 12:12.475
In all honesty, of course we didn't.

12:13.116 --> 12:22.271
But that just ingrained some of that feeling that we have about the difference in the way Aggies treat people and the way Longhorns treat people.

12:22.291 --> 12:24.154
All right, and I think it's that weekend...

12:25.079 --> 12:31.266
Just before that weekend, where were you when you heard the news of what had happened in Dallas?

12:32.267 --> 12:32.647
Okay.

12:34.769 --> 12:35.790
I was in Duncan.

12:36.411 --> 12:37.192
I was in Duncan.

12:37.272 --> 12:38.293
It was at lunch.

12:39.474 --> 12:45.961
And Steve Reeves, one of my buddies, came up and told me that he had just heard it.

12:46.001 --> 12:47.243
We went back to the dorm.

12:48.124 --> 12:49.365
I called all the...

12:49.750 --> 12:59.385
that was when I was a junior, called all of the outfit together and just talked to them about the situation.

12:59.405 --> 13:05.374
A lot of people, a lot of cadets were crying and it was a tough time.

13:05.394 --> 13:09.059
Whether you liked Kennedy or not was beside the point.

13:09.079 --> 13:11.022
He was still president.

13:11.042 --> 13:13.446
It was a terrible situation.

13:14.557 --> 13:18.101
So yeah, that's one of those places you'll always remember, and I was in Duncan Best Hall.

13:19.303 --> 13:21.225
All right, Bonfire was canceled.

13:21.285 --> 13:21.726
That's right.

13:22.907 --> 13:26.512
Built, ready to go, pretty much.

13:27.053 --> 13:37.746
And on Bonfire, describe back in your student days, how long did everybody work on Bonfire?

13:38.485 --> 13:44.413
Well, the leaders of bonfire back in those days, the head leader was the bonfire chief.

13:44.933 --> 13:48.518
It wasn't the red pox and stuff like that back in those days.

13:48.979 --> 13:51.362
But each different area had a supervisor.

13:51.382 --> 13:54.546
There was usually a core outfit.

13:54.806 --> 13:58.331
One outfit became specialist in the center pole.

13:58.411 --> 14:01.896
Another outfit became specialist in the cut area.

14:02.136 --> 14:04.459
And so you had different assignments that you

14:04.844 --> 14:11.174
had passed on, word had been passed on about how to do these different things in an expert way and why to do it and how to do it.

14:11.195 --> 14:17.325
And that lasted for 90 plus years, I guess, or something in that neighborhood, a long time.

14:17.385 --> 14:21.872
And we would get to the cut the best way we could.

14:21.972 --> 14:24.997
Everybody would be involved, of course.

14:25.238 --> 14:31.408
And we had some civilians there because the Corps was only compulsory two years.

14:31.591 --> 14:33.194
and they were involved in it.

14:34.316 --> 14:37.321
But now, about when did the cutting start?

14:37.922 --> 14:43.271
I would say it seems to me like it even started in September.

14:44.173 --> 14:45.776
It was early on.

14:46.076 --> 14:55.152
Pre-planning, even the year before those in charge were planning, so it was a year-long planning situation, but as far as actual working physically, working on it,

14:55.537 --> 15:01.386
You know, it was at least two, two and a half, maybe even three months from the beginning of school.

15:01.506 --> 15:04.510
Part of it, you started having meetings about it even then.

15:05.211 --> 15:09.818
Do you remember, during your years, do you remember any serious injuries?

15:10.079 --> 15:10.259
No.

15:11.000 --> 15:13.484
No, I do not.

15:14.625 --> 15:18.231
There were guys that maybe, you know, broke on or put in the hospital.

15:18.291 --> 15:22.557
In fact, I remember my senior, when I was a head yell eater, I did not even...

15:23.836 --> 15:26.400
remember this until a guy reminded me of it.

15:27.221 --> 15:43.166
One of the cadets had been hurt, and I didn't know him from Adam, but I was at Olsen Field at a baseball game about five years ago, and this guy comes up to me and he says, I know you don't remember me, but I was a fish when you were the head jail eater.

15:43.927 --> 15:47.633
He said, I got hurt at Bonfire, and was in the hospital, and

15:47.883 --> 16:07.022
he said one of the biggest events of my entire time at amem was when you came to visit me and and i just said to myself i said well that must be one of the times i was listening to jesus and doing what he wanted instead of what frank cox wanted it was a real highlight for him to come up and

16:07.205 --> 16:14.693
and say that, but sure, there were cuts and bruises and bumps and maybe some broken bones, but no injury.

16:14.793 --> 16:16.535
It was totally organized.

16:16.575 --> 16:17.857
It wasn't a game at all.

16:17.917 --> 16:20.139
They were totally focused back then.

16:20.179 --> 16:24.164
I'm not knocking anybody or anything, but I'll say this.

16:25.325 --> 16:32.453
There wasn't anybody out there that was, hey, let me take you on a buggy ride and a Six Flags event and lose focus.

16:33.833 --> 16:34.854
That's what that was about.

16:34.874 --> 16:39.621
It was a job, and it wasn't a show off time.

16:39.641 --> 16:41.764
And Bonfire was on Duncan?

16:41.804 --> 16:42.445
That's right.

16:42.465 --> 16:43.186
It was on the back end.

16:43.346 --> 16:47.011
And it was a... It was in a pole and an outhouse.

16:47.291 --> 16:49.134
No, but in terms of style.

16:49.915 --> 16:50.996
The teepee style.

16:51.016 --> 16:52.859
Yeah, it wasn't... It wasn't here.

16:53.019 --> 16:55.683
No, it wasn't a straight out.

16:55.783 --> 16:56.644
I don't know when that happened.

16:56.664 --> 16:58.947
There was after I left, but we were...

16:59.568 --> 17:06.916
the organization of it, and passing on the information, and this is what you do, and this is why you do it, and a manual of it, and how to do it.

17:06.976 --> 17:17.667
It wasn't, none of it was taken lightly, and it was, we might not have had sophisticated engineering drawings, but everybody knew their job and did it.

17:17.828 --> 17:20.430
I don't remember drinking going on.

17:20.450 --> 17:24.995
It could have been, it just might have been because I didn't, and I didn't look for that stuff.

17:25.015 --> 17:27.158
I don't remember drinking.

17:27.178 --> 17:29.440
Somebody else might can tell you different, but,

17:30.010 --> 17:35.924
I wasn't aware of any alcohol during the building of it and that type of stuff.

17:35.944 --> 17:43.282
It was serious business and everybody took their job seriously and it was quite a feat.

17:43.302 --> 17:46.028
It was one of the best times of my life.

17:46.193 --> 17:47.815
to be involved in something like that.

17:47.835 --> 17:55.303
All right, now your junior year when bonfire is canceled, the stack was already up or partly up?

17:55.323 --> 17:57.546
It was pretty much, I think it was partly up.

17:57.586 --> 17:59.868
It was pretty close, best I remember.

17:59.928 --> 18:02.651
I'm trying to think back.

18:03.292 --> 18:07.116
Most of the time, our outfit was mostly responsible for the cut area.

18:08.397 --> 18:10.400
Squadron 2 was never involved with the stack area.

18:11.461 --> 18:14.344
And so we were out in the woods most of the time.

18:15.117 --> 18:18.142
And I can't remember, to tell you the truth, how far along it was.

18:18.162 --> 18:19.444
I bet there's some pictures.

18:19.544 --> 18:20.365
Do you have any idea?

18:20.385 --> 18:22.208
Do you remember what happened to those logs?

18:22.308 --> 18:23.791
Were they, they were then hauled?

18:23.811 --> 18:28.879
They were just, they were all just laying there and how they, they got rid of them.

18:28.899 --> 18:31.243
I do not remember that the Corps was involved in that.

18:31.363 --> 18:33.907
I don't remember us going out and doing that.

18:34.167 --> 18:41.479
We might have, and my memories just slipped me, but whether a company was hired to haul them off, I'm not for sure.

18:42.472 --> 18:44.736
Back to being a Yale leader.

18:44.777 --> 18:46.019
Did you have a favorite Yale?

18:48.183 --> 18:49.346
Well, I like former spy.

18:50.187 --> 18:52.111
I like military.

18:52.131 --> 18:53.474
What about your least favorite?

18:53.494 --> 18:54.556
Did you have a least favorite?

18:56.139 --> 18:58.504
Lizzie, I guess, I think it was the name of it.

18:58.624 --> 18:59.045
Lizzie.

18:59.285 --> 19:01.830
And we didn't

19:02.722 --> 19:03.703
do that much.

19:03.723 --> 19:06.447
That's the one with the high voice.

19:07.308 --> 19:12.475
Now wasn't there a special yell for each Southwest Conference opponent then?

19:13.977 --> 19:15.259
Was there a Baylor yell?

19:15.299 --> 19:18.183
I do not remember that.

19:18.323 --> 19:19.325
Is that right?

19:19.345 --> 19:19.445
Okay.

19:19.465 --> 19:20.947
Maybe somebody else can tell you.

19:21.147 --> 19:22.710
I don't remember us doing it as yell eaters.

19:22.730 --> 19:25.253
They might have come out of the stands.

19:26.127 --> 19:32.656
Are there any yells now that we do that were not done when you were yelled?

19:32.676 --> 19:34.919
Yes, there have been some changes.

19:35.801 --> 19:52.945
One of the ones that I'm being honest about it that aggravates me the most is the yell that we seem to do more than any other is beat the hell out of whoever we have to be playing and the old arm signal for that.

19:53.583 --> 19:58.327
which I understand started around 1969 or something, if I'm not mistaken.

19:58.688 --> 20:04.973
It was after my time, and I was not pleased when I saw that, and it has become so predominant.

20:04.993 --> 20:16.364
I just, again, it might be going back to my Christian faith that you can't beat the hell out of anybody to begin with, so here we are saying something that you can't even do, and it's just not the Aggie spirit to me.

20:16.464 --> 20:17.805
I do not like that at all.

20:18.606 --> 20:23.050
Again, it's putting more focus on them, and it's giving somebody else something to say about us that,

20:23.536 --> 20:28.200
that anybody can say that, but Aggies, every one of our yells are different.

20:28.941 --> 20:30.622
They're not high schoolers.

20:31.063 --> 20:33.845
No other schools has yells like we do.

20:34.306 --> 20:36.728
For us to do that, I really hate that.

20:36.988 --> 20:49.920
And the other one that doesn't bother me, it's kind of cute, and if it was original, I don't know whether it came from them watching some other school on TV, but sit down bus driver at the basketball games mostly is where that's done.

20:50.080 --> 20:53.003
It's kind of cute, and I don't really mind that too much.

20:53.455 --> 20:57.424
And that's kind of taken hold.

20:58.727 --> 21:01.573
I want to add for an editorial note.

21:01.713 --> 21:02.755
Yes.

21:02.996 --> 21:12.156
One of the Yale leaders, when they beat the hell out of whomever Yale was getting started, one of the Yale leaders was in one of my classes.

21:13.503 --> 21:28.272
And I called him after class, called him aside, and told him that the hand signal, that that is a vulgar gesture in much of the world, and he wasn't aware of it.

21:29.028 --> 21:34.897
And I tried to tell him that that would not be well respected anywhere else.

21:36.460 --> 21:49.640
Then one that I heard about indirectly was one of the first years we did that, we went up and played basketball against Oral Roberts University in Tulsa.

21:50.401 --> 21:56.571
And one of the L leaders jumped down to the floor and right in front of the man for whom that school is named,

21:56.888 --> 22:04.158
did that gesture and yelled out, beat the hell out of Oral Roberts, and that Mr. Roberts did not like that at all.

22:05.140 --> 22:07.163
I've never heard that, but I don't blame him.

22:07.183 --> 22:16.315
All right, during all of your Yell Eater experiences, what are some of the happiest moments and any sad moments that you remember being a Yell Eater?

22:17.397 --> 22:23.646
Well, I guess the sad moment was the one I mentioned a while ago about the T-sip game here.

22:24.787 --> 22:25.208
Yeah.

22:26.453 --> 22:29.556
But everyone was always really nice.

22:29.576 --> 22:33.640
When you were a Yale leader, you were also on the Southwest Conference Sportsmanship Committee.

22:33.660 --> 22:39.406
And I know people say we're prejudiced, but I still think Aggies treat their opponents better than anyone.

22:39.426 --> 22:43.490
We're fiercely loyal to our school, and unashamedly so.

22:44.311 --> 22:54.942
But I've never really seen Aggies do some of the things that I've seen at other schools, where they slice your tires and really are vulgar and irvery on a personal one-on-one basis.

22:55.175 --> 23:02.984
at LSU ball games, they threw beer cans at us at the game while we're walking out on the field.

23:03.024 --> 23:05.126
I mean, they're throwing beer cans at us.

23:05.246 --> 23:23.646
At Texas, my junior year at basketball, we went down to play the Longhorns and that's the days we had Benny Lennox who was a great basketball player and one of the best ever and we were about to win the Southwest Conference but we were

23:24.082 --> 23:34.252
We were leading Texas all the way, and they had to take Benny Lennox out with about three minutes to go, Coach Shelby Metcalf did, to rest him, and the Sips caught up and went ahead of us.

23:34.292 --> 23:39.157
He put Lennox back in, and he hit three from the top of the circle.

23:39.177 --> 23:40.538
They would have been three corners a day.

23:40.778 --> 23:46.264
He takes the ball all the way down the court, pops the net three times, wind up winning the game.

23:46.804 --> 23:49.026
There were about 300 Aggies there at the game.

23:50.348 --> 23:52.890
We go out on the court, and even during the game,

23:53.410 --> 23:55.912
the Longhorn fans were throwing cups of ice at us.

23:57.714 --> 24:12.687
But after the game, we were congratulating our players, but all the Longhorn fans came out also, and we were lined up down the court about a foot apart, and finally somebody hit somebody else, and the melee breaks out, and have a big fight.

24:12.787 --> 24:21.915
One of my freshmen came up to me, and he had a slash about four inches long on his cheek, where somebody hit him with some brass nuts, and it was just gassed open, bleeding.

24:22.537 --> 24:24.739
and they had to play the National Anthem.

24:24.779 --> 24:30.464
Dust was coming up out of the floor from the fight, and they were playing the National Anthem, trying to get everybody to stop.

24:30.524 --> 24:41.394
It finally stopped, but the next day in the paper in Austin, it said that A&M Gladiators, Storm, Gregory Jim, or something, they tried to blame it on us.

24:41.474 --> 24:46.258
We had 300, they had 7,000, and of course it was the Aggies' fault, you know.

24:46.318 --> 24:51.683
But it was such a blessed experience, my whole experience really,

24:51.983 --> 24:55.006
I can't complain about anything as far as being a Yale leader.

24:55.026 --> 25:00.612
I met a lot of great people, and cheerleaders from other schools, they were always nice.

25:01.733 --> 25:02.914
Never had a problem there.

25:02.934 --> 25:17.869
I happened to have dated for a couple of years an Arkansas cheerleader that was from Texarkana back in my hometown, and she was a cheerleader in Arkansas, and I was a Yale leader at A&M.

25:17.889 --> 25:19.611
When Arkansas came down to play us,

25:20.063 --> 25:37.854
and we were already out on the track and all the corps was in the stands and she comes in through the tunnel there with the rest of the cheerleaders and walks right in front of the corps and I go up and hug her and just kiss her on the cheek and of course the corps goes wild about it.

25:37.954 --> 25:40.198
She was really a cute, sweet girl.

25:40.786 --> 25:42.569
And a great time.

25:42.589 --> 25:43.710
So that was a fun time.

25:43.790 --> 25:46.334
It was a good time.

25:46.975 --> 25:50.280
Getting to know the athletes and having a oneness with them.

25:51.081 --> 25:52.323
Who were some of your favorites?

25:52.904 --> 25:56.509
Well, in basketball, Benny Lennox and John Beasley.

25:56.569 --> 25:57.851
I was here at a great time.

25:57.911 --> 26:00.094
And Randy Mattson even played basketball.

26:00.395 --> 26:14.176
Davey Johnson, who later became the coach of the World Series champions in the Mets, and were some of the most famous that we knew, and Jerry Nichols, and all those great, they were great guys.

26:14.196 --> 26:15.137
They were Aggies, too.

26:15.157 --> 26:16.139
They knew the war hymn.

26:16.159 --> 26:21.627
I can tell you this, athletes in those days knew the war hymn, they knew the spirit, they were Aggies.

26:22.113 --> 26:27.521
It's one of my pet peeves today to go to a basketball game, and not one of them knows.

26:27.721 --> 26:30.345
What about working with Coach Shelby Metcalf?

26:30.446 --> 26:31.728
What a joy, and still he is.

26:31.788 --> 26:42.944
Every time I see him, I remember always funny and pleasant, always kind to me and to Yale leaders, always supportive.

26:43.646 --> 26:48.593
And even through the years, even after that time, my son went to some basketball camps down here, and

26:49.079 --> 27:00.676
And seeing him even now, and even when he was treated like he was, when he was dismissed from A&M, which was one of the tragedies, that and Gene Stallings, two of my pet peeves of what Aggies have done to Aggies.

27:01.336 --> 27:10.570
But I wrote a letter to the editor regarding that situation, and he always mentions that to me and how much he appreciated my comments.

27:11.150 --> 27:12.292
So he's a true Aggie.

27:12.312 --> 27:17.179
He didn't go to A&M, but I always say that there are a lot of students at A&M that aren't Aggies.

27:17.648 --> 27:28.690
And there are also a lot of Aggies who weren't ever students at A&M, but have that Aggie spirit and heart and the ethics and accountability and trust and support that is really what Aggies are all about.

27:29.291 --> 27:32.998
And, you know, just like yourself, you didn't go to A&M, right?

27:33.379 --> 27:36.245
But what better ambassador, who cares?

27:36.425 --> 27:38.509
And what you're doing, I really appreciate.

27:39.012 --> 27:42.356
You're taking the time and effort to do this and all the things you've done over the years.

27:43.418 --> 27:44.980
Thank you.

27:45.020 --> 27:46.622
We don't take it lightly.

27:47.383 --> 27:50.747
You're what A&M and Aggieland and being an Aggie is all about.

27:51.688 --> 28:01.000
As you're getting ready to be a senior, do you run for head yell leader or do you just... Actually, you do.

28:01.221 --> 28:06.327
Ted Hopgood, who's the current commandant of Texas A&M, he was one of my classmates.

28:06.347 --> 28:08.530
He was the other junior yell leader.

28:09.202 --> 28:16.170
And like I tell everybody, back in those days, to be a yell eater, all you had to be doing was passing and not have a prisoner in there.

28:16.190 --> 28:21.876
You didn't have to be a hunk and strong and good looking like they are today, you know, or an entertainer.

28:22.797 --> 28:28.584
So we didn't do all the campaigning and the posters and all.

28:28.604 --> 28:32.028
And we both felt like, well, they know us by now.

28:32.068 --> 28:35.732
They've seen us both and we'll just let them decide.

28:36.016 --> 28:37.017
pretty much what it was done.

28:37.037 --> 28:43.584
There was no campaigning at all that I remember, and just have it your way.

28:43.705 --> 28:50.272
All right, so there are three seniors, one of whom is a civilian.

28:51.093 --> 28:51.273
Yes, sir.

28:51.293 --> 28:55.978
And the other two are running, and then the one that gets the most votes is the head yelling?

28:56.138 --> 29:00.303
That's the way it's always been that I know of until just a couple of years ago.

29:00.323 --> 29:02.325
Do you remember what the percentage was?

29:03.086 --> 29:03.947
Well...

29:04.855 --> 29:05.957
I do not.

29:06.418 --> 29:07.379
I've got that bat.

29:08.621 --> 29:16.455
Was there any, when you learned you'd been head yellator, did your buddies?

29:16.475 --> 29:21.143
Oh yeah, they really, especially for my outfit,

29:22.085 --> 29:24.468
Pretty much did the same thing they did when I was a junior.

29:24.848 --> 29:25.029
Okay.

29:25.049 --> 29:26.771
And through that same routine again.

29:28.213 --> 29:33.559
Back in those days, when you were head yell eater, you could not be the commander of your outfit.

29:33.579 --> 29:36.663
Now, usually the first sergeant becomes commander their senior year.

29:37.264 --> 29:39.286
And I love the outfit.

29:39.426 --> 29:40.688
I'm not a staff person.

29:41.589 --> 29:43.251
And it was really hard on me.

29:43.311 --> 29:45.253
I begged them to let me do both.

29:45.374 --> 29:51.501
I wanted to be the commander of Squadron 2, but back in those days, they wouldn't let you.

29:52.021 --> 29:56.909
And so I chose to be head yell leader, and the head yell leader was on core staff.

29:58.251 --> 29:59.914
And who was core commander?

30:00.956 --> 30:09.169
Neil Keltner, our senior year, was core commander, and Terry Odson was the executive, and great people, David Fox.

30:10.988 --> 30:13.611
And you're also in the RVs?

30:14.311 --> 30:15.613
Yes.

30:15.633 --> 30:20.497
And as an RV, you went to Governor's Inauguration and to New Orleans?

30:21.679 --> 30:25.142
Now, my senior year, I was not in the RVs.

30:25.242 --> 30:31.348
RVs is normally a junior outfit, except for the few that desire to be some officers in the RVs.

30:31.448 --> 30:37.074
So my senior year, I didn't go out for any of those positions.

30:37.634 --> 30:40.337
So I did go to Mardi Gras.

30:40.688 --> 30:45.072
honor guard for King Rex at Mardi Gras, and that was quite an experience for a country boy.

30:45.112 --> 30:48.075
I tell you, I saw some things I never thought I'd see.

30:48.275 --> 30:49.276
How did y'all get over there?

30:49.556 --> 30:50.217
Just had to.

30:50.477 --> 30:50.878
On your own?

30:51.358 --> 30:51.879
On your own.

30:52.039 --> 30:52.899
No help at all.

30:53.040 --> 30:57.544
I don't remember any kind of financial help ever in yellow eating or RVs.

30:58.705 --> 31:02.729
Did you buy your RV uniform, or are they passed on?

31:04.911 --> 31:06.012
They were passed on.

31:07.133 --> 31:09.976
I'm almost positive of that.

31:10.176 --> 31:10.476
Okay.

31:11.603 --> 31:17.751
In fact, my senior boots that I bought were from a guy that had been in the Corps a couple of years before.

31:17.811 --> 31:21.476
Back then, a lot of the guys didn't keep their senior boots like everybody does now.

31:21.496 --> 31:22.518
Do you remember what they cost?

31:22.538 --> 31:22.998
It was cheaper.

31:23.379 --> 31:24.100
I think it was $90.

31:24.120 --> 31:24.601
Where'd you get them?

31:24.621 --> 31:25.422
I don't want to say $90.

31:25.842 --> 31:28.386
I got them from a guy that was about myself.

31:28.406 --> 31:29.207
No, where'd you get the money?

31:29.948 --> 31:38.319
Oh, I'm sure from my parents, to tell you the truth, I imagine, at that time, because I surely didn't work, you know, at that time.

31:39.000 --> 31:41.323
The time was just unbelievable.
