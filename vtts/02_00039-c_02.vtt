WEBVTT

00:02.630 --> 00:12.485
He continued to pursue the funding and determined, well, yes, with some little extra auxiliary enterprise money in it and so forth, that we could go ahead with the runway.

00:12.525 --> 00:16.871
But I thought that was pretty interesting that he dug his heels in and he would not take no for an answer.

00:17.132 --> 00:18.313
So is it $10,000?

00:18.333 --> 00:18.754
$10,000.

00:18.774 --> 00:20.276
A little over $10,000.

00:21.077 --> 00:23.261
And that 747 can land out there right now.

00:25.764 --> 00:27.507
Can't take off, load it.

00:28.280 --> 00:30.906
Under the old runway, it couldn't, but it probably can now.

00:31.528 --> 00:32.771
Yeah, it can now.

00:35.718 --> 00:39.106
All right, what were your, looking back on all those years, what were your proudest moments?

00:40.249 --> 00:43.116
You're saying, I'm proud I was a part of what?

00:43.872 --> 00:45.234
You're talking about at A&M now.

00:46.375 --> 00:53.243
Of course, becoming a major general in the Air Force had to be very close to the top.

00:53.264 --> 01:00.312
But obviously, I would think of A&M being made a full vice president of Texas A&M was the thing that I'm the proudest of.

01:00.753 --> 01:06.480
But what specific... Oh, you're talking about accomplishments within that area?

01:06.740 --> 01:07.000
Yes.

01:10.465 --> 01:11.926
Oh, that's a tough one.

01:11.946 --> 01:13.288
There's so many things that I've...

01:15.007 --> 01:17.931
People I worked with were a great source of pride for me.

01:18.212 --> 01:21.116
Who were the ones at the top of this?

01:21.316 --> 01:28.948
The people that reported directly to me as Vice President had a great deal of pride.

01:28.968 --> 01:30.270
I had a great deal of pride in that.

01:30.450 --> 01:36.539
Joe Estill, Bob Wyatt, Jean Ray, Grounds Maintenance.

01:37.361 --> 01:43.630
Mary Helen Bowers reported to me for a while, did an excellent job.

01:44.656 --> 01:48.720
Are your other subordinates that you're proud of?

01:50.202 --> 01:58.110
Throughout my career, I would say Fred Dollar would have to be very close to the top because he was just such a great guy and did such a wonderful job.

02:00.953 --> 02:08.000
Steve Hodge is another guy that rubs a lot of people the wrong way because of his abrasive nature.

02:08.020 --> 02:10.883
I tell everyone he's got the personality of a New York cab driver.

02:11.757 --> 02:12.758
He's from New York.

02:12.998 --> 02:21.367
I hired him from a little university in the south near the Brooklyn Bridge on Manhattan Island called Pace University, a small place.

02:22.308 --> 02:33.819
But when the Rudder Theater Complex was nearing completion, we had a consultant named John Dittimore who was from Purdue, ran the Hall of Music at Purdue.

02:34.740 --> 02:37.883
And one of his jobs was to recommend staffing for the theater complex.

02:38.993 --> 02:43.559
And he says, I gave you one name, and if you can't get him, then I'll give you some other names.

02:44.140 --> 02:53.613
But Steve Hodge was the name he gave as being the best qualified man in the entire country to do what we wanted to have done, and he's proven that to be so.

02:54.955 --> 02:57.539
Mike, I also want to record on here.

02:57.599 --> 03:07.633
I was on the committee for the planning of the MSC expansion in the Rudder Tower, and I remember when the architect unveiled his plans for us, Ed Romanek

03:08.069 --> 03:15.179
then the dean of architecture, or whatever the title was, asked about what kind of parking.

03:15.199 --> 03:16.701
Well, that wasn't part of my charge.

03:17.522 --> 03:21.648
And he was saying, wait, a good architect plans how people get there.

03:21.668 --> 03:22.188
Absolutely.

03:22.469 --> 03:26.314
Now, that expansion,

03:26.952 --> 03:30.216
The Rudder tower and all has functioned quite well, hasn't it?

03:30.236 --> 03:30.977
Indeed it has.

03:31.317 --> 03:32.358
It's been an outstanding.

03:32.378 --> 03:38.245
The only problem we ever had was that we've had terrible trouble with leaks on the roof of that theater complex.

03:39.126 --> 03:39.347
Oh, really?

03:39.367 --> 03:44.212
And we've had, in fact, they tried for years to fix the leaks, so finally they just redid the whole thing.

03:44.953 --> 03:45.414
Oh, okay.

03:45.434 --> 03:48.538
You're talking about the Rudder concert hall and the theater and all that?

03:48.558 --> 03:48.838
Yes, yes.

03:48.858 --> 03:49.359
That structure?

03:49.379 --> 03:49.519
Right.

03:49.699 --> 03:51.521
Everything on that side of the tower.

03:53.083 --> 03:56.487
And the exhibit hall and all the theaters leaked.

03:57.293 --> 03:59.457
And we never really knew why.

03:59.798 --> 04:02.684
But they finally wound up fixing it by just replacing the whole thing.

04:03.105 --> 04:04.287
A very expensive project.

04:06.352 --> 04:09.779
What have I left out about your professional?

04:09.799 --> 04:11.562
What else should we have chatted about?

04:12.023 --> 04:12.805
Oh my goodness.

04:17.408 --> 04:25.725
I think probably where I developed what few management skills I had was at Sears and as manager of the bookstore.

04:26.587 --> 04:33.421
And those skills that I picked up in those two jobs helped me all through the rest of my career, both here and in the Air Force.

04:33.441 --> 04:36.828
I'm assuming that also your Air Force experience helped your people.

04:36.888 --> 04:37.610
Without a doubt.

04:37.950 --> 04:38.792
Without a doubt.

04:39.160 --> 04:42.906
I had some great responsibility in the Air Force.

04:44.167 --> 04:50.457
Most people don't realize what an important role the Reserves play in the Air Force, but it's a predominant part of the Air Force now.

04:51.398 --> 04:56.165
We've been involved in every conflict since, well, since.

04:57.587 --> 05:02.494
And although we're not full-time, we're just up to our neck in responsibility.

05:02.975 --> 05:06.400
And it was a great management training field for me.

05:07.207 --> 05:11.293
Now we're back to the mainstream and we're getting closer.

05:11.953 --> 05:14.817
Do you have any Aggie ring stories about your ring?

05:16.900 --> 05:25.532
The only thing I have is that most people in my class, the seal is almost worn completely smooth and mine is not.

05:25.652 --> 05:28.656
And most people say, you know, don't you ever work in your ring?

05:28.696 --> 05:30.919
I never take it off.

05:31.608 --> 05:34.213
The company that makes our ratings is called Balfour.

05:35.795 --> 05:41.766
And at the time, and until this day I presume, they're handled through the Association of Former Students.

05:42.727 --> 05:45.933
But Balfour did a great deal of business with the exchange store.

05:47.015 --> 05:48.958
And they had a guy that was

05:49.411 --> 05:54.358
a close friend of Buck Wirus, and his name was, what was his name?

05:54.538 --> 05:55.539
I thought I'd never forget it.

05:56.440 --> 06:02.128
But anyway, he was the representative for the Belfort Company and the vice president because this was by far their largest ring account.

06:02.188 --> 06:08.837
In fact, A&M ring account is larger than all the rest of their university ring accounts put together.

06:09.290 --> 06:13.637
Well, he was in my office one day and he said, Chuck, your ring's almost smooth.

06:13.817 --> 06:14.779
I said, yeah, it surely is.

06:15.339 --> 06:29.762
He said, we have a procedure that we can take a fine saw and saw off that seal and sweat another seal on and the ring will be the original ring with your original inscription inside.

06:30.299 --> 06:34.685
So I think it cost me $50 at the time to have that done.

06:35.406 --> 06:41.274
And so the seal on my ring is a replacement seal, but the ring itself is the original ring.

06:42.195 --> 06:44.779
You're not one of those that lost it and was found?

06:45.079 --> 06:47.503
No, I've never lost it.

06:47.523 --> 07:00.120
Do you have any Aggie ring memories where in a conversation or a first introduction having that ring on open a door?

07:01.585 --> 07:05.170
Don't remember anything specifically, but it comes up all the time, even to this day.

07:05.831 --> 07:08.875
You know, especially with some of the younger kids that are still in school.

07:09.997 --> 07:12.741
They'll always, almost invariably ask, what class are you in?

07:12.921 --> 07:14.243
You know, that's the opening comment.

07:14.263 --> 07:15.184
What's your class?

07:15.925 --> 07:17.027
And you say, class of 53.

07:17.167 --> 07:20.332
Well, I had a dad that was in class of 83 or something like that.

07:21.453 --> 07:25.219
And so it is a very definite topic of conversation.

07:26.560 --> 07:29.044
What contributes so much to Aggie spirits?

07:31.606 --> 07:36.279
I think back when I was a student, it was because we were all in the same boat together.

07:37.041 --> 07:38.605
And all we had was each other.

07:39.428 --> 07:44.923
And that develops a great camaraderie, a feeling of camaraderie.

07:45.460 --> 07:46.982
but it continues with others.

07:47.623 --> 07:58.979
Yeah, and I don't know unless it's the fact that we live, you know, even though Bryan and College Station is still a growing community and so much larger than when I was here, it's still a small town by big city standards.

08:00.020 --> 08:05.969
And the kids still have, they depend on each other and trust each other, and fish camp has a whole lot to do with that.

08:06.109 --> 08:09.333
I would agree with you entirely on fish.

08:09.353 --> 08:13.459
What are the other events that contribute to this unity?

08:14.165 --> 08:23.499
It has to be some of the staples like Munster and Silver Taps and all the athletic events, especially football, that bring the students together.

08:24.060 --> 08:38.923
They've had a lot of things now that we didn't have such as the work day that they have, the march to the Brazos for various philanthropic type activities that we didn't have.

08:39.697 --> 08:42.540
And so all those things bring them together.

08:42.740 --> 08:48.286
Of course, the core, I guess, is the single biggest unifying activity on the campus, even still.

08:48.867 --> 09:00.339
As you see the institution now and its current students and recent graduates, do you feel that there is still the pride and the spirit?

09:00.359 --> 09:02.602
I think so, yes.

09:02.622 --> 09:07.527
And I say that just as an outside observer because I've been retired for 12 years now, if you can imagine that.

09:07.962 --> 09:10.826
But yes, I would say the spirit is definitely there.

09:11.427 --> 09:21.360
Maybe they may not know each other on a personal basis the way we did because the school was so small when I was a student here that we knew an awful lot of people by name.

09:22.641 --> 09:26.447
Okay, three questions left.

09:26.467 --> 09:30.612
What did it mean to you in your life that you attended Texas A&M?

09:31.621 --> 09:38.190
Well, I probably wouldn't be retired with all the good memories that I have now.

09:38.350 --> 09:41.234
I'd probably still be working in some menial job somewhere.

09:42.356 --> 09:49.486
I would say that, well, it's meant more to me than a way to make a living.

09:50.127 --> 09:54.473
It's meant a lot of friends, and it's a real sad time right now for me.

09:55.162 --> 09:57.786
because so many of my close, close friends are dying.

09:58.127 --> 09:59.669
My roommate died this last year.

10:01.192 --> 10:02.934
He was the best man at my wedding, you know.

10:03.495 --> 10:08.363
Several other of my very, very close friends in the Corps have died within the last two or three years.

10:09.104 --> 10:13.471
And so, but it brings home the fact that they did mean so much to you.

10:14.032 --> 10:15.735
And I'd say that

10:16.289 --> 10:20.333
Most of my close memories were developed through the Corps.

10:21.294 --> 10:25.738
And of course, in my days, the Corps and the university were synonymous terms.

10:27.320 --> 10:44.136
If someone gave you a million dollar check now and put only one specificity on it, you must give this to Texas A&M, but you decide what uses to be made of it, what would you tell A&M to do with your gift?

10:46.225 --> 10:48.609
I'd probably give half of it to the core endowment fund.

10:49.810 --> 10:51.773
The other half probably in scholarships.

10:52.374 --> 10:53.436
For?

10:53.456 --> 10:53.776
For.

10:55.839 --> 10:56.761
Who gets them?

10:56.781 --> 11:04.673
Of course, being a graduate of the College of Business, which is what is now the College of Business, I would probably, the bulk of it would go to that.

11:07.497 --> 11:08.198
Last question.

11:08.759 --> 11:11.383
What feelings do you have in your heart for Texas A&M?

11:12.644 --> 11:15.709
Well, the question chokes me up.

11:19.672 --> 11:21.042
Not the only answer I can give you.
