WEBVTT

00:04.435 --> 00:14.227
So this building has from its beginning been 
intended to be and has been a student funded

00:04.435 --> 00:14.227
facility. A user funded in theory.

00:21.516 --> 00:29.025
We had to go to the Texas legislature to get their 
okay to charge a mandatory fee.

00:32.330 --> 00:33.531
Any problems there? Yeah, a lot of them. Really? 
What were they?

00:40.163 --> 00:53.443
Well, initially, Texas had done this two years 
before for their recreation center, and their fee

00:40.163 --> 00:53.443
was $35.

00:56.545 --> 01:11.740
And I'm not sure this ought to be, we had an 
administrator, I can tell you later who it was, who

00:56.545 --> 01:11.740
I think helped write the legislation, sent it 
forward, didn't ask me, didn't ask anybody else.

01:12.501 --> 01:15.764
Well, this legislation ended up being exactly 
what Texas had. And our students had voted for 50,

01:15.924 --> 01:18.186
not 35. So I spent the next two years or year and a 
half saying, we're not gonna build this building

01:21.875 --> 01:27.028
for 35 because we're gonna end up having a lot less 
than what we need. Same thing happened in Texas.

01:29.815 --> 01:32.001
They didn't get what they wanted for their 35. So we 
ended up compromising, so to speak, He would go, we

01:37.805 --> 01:47.116
would amend the bill two years later at 50 if we 
would build, if we would put an auditorium on the

01:37.805 --> 01:47.116
building. At that time we were looking at a leisure 
pool. And so we, plus they also funded some money

01:49.438 --> 01:55.986
for us too, three and a half million dollars. So. 
All right, then who were the key planners of what

01:57.968 --> 02:04.035
would go into the building? We did, I personally 
visited 21 institutions. Moffett Adams was the

02:12.626 --> 02:16.891
chief architect of the system. He went with me on 
about 15 of those trips. So we got a pretty good

02:23.800 --> 02:26.483
picture of what was out there. We selected an 
architecture firm, Armand Mach out of San

02:28.025 --> 02:31.369
Antonio. I just spelled the last name. Marmon, 
M-A-R-M-O-N, and Mock is M-O-K. M-O-K, okay.

02:38.901 --> 02:40.803
Marmon, Mock, two names. Oh, so it's hyphenated 
names. It's not hyphenated. Not hyphenated, but

02:43.025 --> 02:47.410
it's two different people. Two different names. 
They were the architects, but before they were

02:48.631 --> 02:56.339
brought on, our staff took the information we got 
from the surveys. By that time, we'd done two

02:56.379 --> 02:59.382
surveys of needs. So the students told us what they 
thought they needed. We did an analysis of the

03:02.937 --> 03:08.467
spaces that we had and what our staff thought we 
needed. And then we sat down and wrote out what's

03:08.928 --> 03:16.662
called a program that tells the architects what it 
is that we want in each different space. all the

03:17.637 --> 03:21.022
different kinds of spaces that we need and then 
what we want to be in space. And actually, I think we

03:21.783 --> 03:28.732
had 11 or 12 authors of that, people that were on 
staff at that time, the majority of them. That was

03:29.353 --> 03:44.995
Tom Reber,

03:29.353 --> 03:44.995
James Walpert, Paula Opal, Mike Waldron, James 
Nash, I think was on staff then, Rick Hall,

03:47.877 --> 04:08.856
down the list

03:47.877 --> 04:08.856
here um

03:47.877 --> 04:08.856
there's about 11 different people i know i haven't 
done it long yet

04:29.592 --> 04:38.605
I guess

04:29.592 --> 04:38.605
that's about it.

04:41.689 --> 04:48.158
And the way we did it, and the reason I think it was so 
successful, is Everybody who was on staff at that

04:49.268 --> 04:53.693
time was assigned space or spaces. Many of them had 
more than one space. And that was theirs from start

04:56.216 --> 04:57.979
to finish. They wrote the program statement. In 
that program statement, there's a list of

05:01.903 --> 05:03.826
equipment. They end up speccing out all that 
equipment for that particular space and going

05:03.846 --> 05:09.993
through the purchasing process. They took it from 
start to finish. And they participated in the

05:12.336 --> 05:17.402
construction process and watching things as we 
went. So that was a good process. Those folks were

05:19.742 --> 05:22.991
probably the most critical. The other things that 
we did once, well, then we hired a consultant, Bill

05:24.575 --> 05:33.197
Manning from University of California, 
Berkeley. And he and Moffitt and I went through the

05:33.751 --> 05:40.921
program statement and did all the editing and did 
all that stuff. Plus, he participated in all the

05:41.061 --> 05:44.586
program design reviews along the way. So Bill 
Manning was really critical to, I say Moffitt,

05:44.946 --> 05:51.996
myself, Bill, and then the staff people that I 
mentioned. As you were dreaming about what this

05:51.976 --> 06:07.892
was going to be, what other institutions were the 
end of the rainbow and what you were hoping to

05:51.976 --> 06:07.892
approximate or hoping to copy, equal, surpass? 
surpass was probably the word we were looking for

06:08.395 --> 06:30.015
because we had a pretty good opportunity with the 
amount of money that we had available but we looked

06:08.395 --> 06:30.015
at and for different reasons different things 
arizona and arizona state probably two of the

06:08.395 --> 06:30.015
newer ones and a particular architect did those 
and several others so that most of his were very

06:08.395 --> 06:30.015
similar We looked at Tulane and a different set of 
architects in a little bit different field,

06:30.350 --> 06:38.781
probably more closely resembling this one than 
anything else that's out there. Texas Tech,

06:38.801 --> 06:47.752
because theirs was probably the first building 
type like this that had the real open effect, and

06:38.801 --> 06:47.752
you notice this building is quite open. We 
actually visited Missouri, because they did some

06:50.135 --> 06:56.323
nice things with their addition, and the old 
building.

07:01.467 --> 07:02.950
Those are probably the major ones. As the students 
let you know what they were hoping for, were there

07:04.413 --> 07:11.369
any surprises? No, not really. I mean,

07:13.894 --> 07:21.130
we were pretty well in tandem with what The surveys 
that we got from them and what we were thinking

07:21.532 --> 07:26.897
about were pretty darn close. In terms of what you 
were hoping to achieve with the new building

07:27.397 --> 07:40.349
compared to what we already had, in which areas 
would we make the greatest improvement? Swimming

07:40.369 --> 07:42.131
facilities?

07:45.074 --> 07:50.779
Weak fitness rooms, swimming.

07:51.670 --> 07:56.280
I think the biggest improvement overall is is when 
you walk in the door, the presentation of sports

07:56.733 --> 08:05.787
facilities in this kind of a venue are so much 
different than they are in the traditional

07:56.733 --> 08:05.787
venues. You go over to the Reed Building, and it's 
not exciting to walk in there. You walk in here, we

08:10.113 --> 08:13.739
just had a tour of all of my colleges. There was 
about 90 of them that came down here for the tour.

08:18.426 --> 08:24.715
Our nurse had a facility, supposing, in Austin, 
and 90 of them came down here to see this place. And

08:24.695 --> 08:29.381
almost to a person, when they walked in the front 
door, their jaw went, wow. And that's one of the

08:30.763 --> 08:39.315
ways that we can get people interested in an 
active, healthy lifestyle, is to do it right. I

08:39.676 --> 08:43.681
mean, the wow factor is what we're looking for. 
That's what Moffitt said. When Moffitt told the

08:45.944 --> 08:52.153
architects, we want an exciting, exuberant 
building that attracts people, We'd get them in

08:52.319 --> 08:53.400
the front door. We'd show them all this stuff. They 
can't help but be excited and want to participate.

08:59.328 --> 09:00.870
And the site had already been selected. No. 
Describe how that came about. Let's go back. After

09:08.380 --> 09:14.428
we did the painting on the program, then we brought 
the architects on. They did a design charrette. It

09:20.096 --> 09:21.938
was like a two- or three-day charrette. The first 
day we spent just trying to put spaces next to each

09:22.660 --> 09:27.887
other that made sense. The second and third day was 
with all of our stakeholders, students, physical

09:28.407 --> 09:41.825
education staff, coaches, you know, whoever 
might have, and a lot of other people in the

09:28.407 --> 09:41.825
university. And we met out at Red Cashin's ranch, 
the little building he had there, the little

09:42.666 --> 09:52.178
house. And they went through discussions. I mean, 
there was 50 people there at times. And that night,

10:00.345 --> 10:03.389
we also had a meeting on campus. And there was 
probably 100 people that showed up that day, just

10:04.751 --> 10:10.279
gathering input that the architects could hear 
for themselves. And that thing went on all day.

10:13.964 --> 10:16.587
There was probably 50 or 60 people that went 
through that. They'd come and go as they had to

10:16.607 --> 10:21.574
leave to go to class and do other things. But they, 
at the end of the day, presented like three

10:22.280 --> 10:31.172
or four different concepts. And we all sat there 
and said, no, you missed the point. Oh, what have we

10:35.778 --> 10:38.241
been saying, you know? And we were all so 
disappointed. I mean, it had been such a

10:40.204 --> 10:46.212
productive day, and they did this, and we all sat 
there and said, oh, no, they just missed the point.

10:46.951 --> 10:49.994
Well, what happened was we went home and they 
worked all night. They presented three concepts

10:50.455 --> 10:56.101
the next morning and we would have taken any of 
them. They were really good. And we focused in on

10:57.843 --> 11:07.574
this concept and then spent the rest of the day 
doing a little refining of some of the ideas we

10:57.843 --> 11:07.574
talked about. What were the most difficult parts 
to accommodate in the structure?

11:16.972 --> 11:24.565
Trying to get the spatial relationships right 
because you have wet areas. You have an outdoor wet

11:24.585 --> 11:30.395
area and an indoor wet area and it's got to relate to 
the locker room. The locker room needs to relate to

11:30.495 --> 11:34.081
the desk and you don't want it in a wet area. So that 
whole thing is more of an art than people would

11:35.043 --> 11:42.996
suggest and that's why one of the Each team of Texas 
architects had to have a nationally known firm who

11:43.887 --> 11:51.245
had built a facility this time before or worked on 
one. We had HOK out of Kansas City. I think that was

11:57.701 --> 12:01.390
really key to have some experience in it. We feel we 
had some experience, but it's nice to have

12:01.775 --> 12:05.218
somebody else there. And that's why we were pretty 
liberal in bringing in consultants, because this

12:05.539 --> 12:20.633
is a once in a lifetime building, and you need to do 
it right, because if you don't do it right, you can

12:05.539 --> 12:20.633
end up with a headache in a lot of different ways, 
especially when you're going to pools and

12:05.539 --> 12:20.633
gymnasiums and stuff like that. It can really turn 
into a

12:20.894 --> 12:25.618
headache. There was a line there. I set it down, and 
now I forget where I was going with it. All right,

12:31.255 --> 12:33.358
other other difficult. You're the sewing area.

12:39.866 --> 12:43.051
Now, actually, I thought our architects pulled 
together pretty good. I mean, we spent probably

12:43.111 --> 12:51.061
six hours in this trend arranging spaces, what 
they call bubble diagrams. And after that was

12:51.782 --> 12:53.044
done, that's pretty Trying to make sure the track 
was, because we were going for a big track, and I

12:53.497 --> 12:59.286
think we got the biggest one in the world. It was 
almost a quarter mile, and that ended up working

13:00.468 --> 13:03.993
out pretty well. The arrangement of the 
racquetball course, we must have drawn up 15

13:05.376 --> 13:15.592
different arrangements, shipped it off to them, 
or worked with them at meetings. That was pretty

13:15.992 --> 13:17.715
difficult. Trying to get it just right. Did you 
have any preconceived ideas that got changed?

13:25.209 --> 13:26.231
Every one of them. Oh, okay. Every preconceived 
idea got changed. That was fun working with these

13:28.235 --> 13:29.657
guys. They were really creative, and their ideas 
were better than mine. That doesn't happen very

13:33.083 --> 13:34.105
often. They really were good. They were fun to work 
with. How did this location come about? That was a

13:43.136 --> 13:52.545
very political kind of a football, and what the 
board did was the right thing, is they said, okay,

13:43.136 --> 13:52.545
you guys give us a recommendation, the 
architects. And they went through a rating

13:53.606 --> 13:57.150
process that worked out pretty well. And although 
this was not my favorite site because we had

13:57.550 --> 14:04.577
intramural fields here, it probably was the best 
site for this particular building. My favorite

14:05.519 --> 14:08.522
site was Duncan Drillfield. In reality, this 
building was too big for that site. We couldn't

14:11.444 --> 14:15.408
have had any associated parking with it. You could 
build the building, but no parking. It really

14:19.391 --> 14:21.393
dominated that space up there, too. One thing they 
liked about putting the building here, it's a big

14:22.674 --> 14:31.061
building, but it doesn't look so big next to Kyle 
Field and Olsen Field and that Reed building. If

14:31.421 --> 14:34.564
you look over here, if you take any of these 
buildings, and you put them over on that other

14:35.236 --> 14:39.962
corner of campus, they're not going to fit very 
well. They all fit pretty well. So that was one of

14:41.149 --> 14:43.120
the considerations, too. Did any board members 
get involved? Actually, we did several

14:48.117 --> 14:53.708
presentations to the board and, I mean, they were 
always, you know, from day one they were

14:48.117 --> 14:53.708
supportive of it. We did, on these trips that we 
took, Moffitt and I took videotape and we put

14:54.049 --> 15:02.686
together what ended up to be about a six and a half 
minute presentation that we showed to the board.

15:03.387 --> 15:05.732
Because most people didn't understand You know, 
you walk into most facilities, they don't look

15:05.712 --> 15:10.400
like this. They look more like what was over there. 
And so we wanted to get the point across of what a

15:13.105 --> 15:18.053
recreation center was going to look like. And the 
video really helped quite a bit to get the point

15:18.795 --> 15:23.603
across to them. They were all supportive, very 
supportive of it. Did any outsider, meaning

15:27.836 --> 15:37.568
someone outside the normal area that should have 
been planting this, did any outsider attempt to

15:27.836 --> 15:37.568
affect it? Romero Galindo. Who? Romero Galindo. 
He owned Arrowfit at the time. He didn't want it at

15:46.988 --> 15:49.911
all. He was making, and in the long run, the guy that 
owned the

15:51.393 --> 16:01.103
school gym, all the local club owners didn't lose a 
lot. At that time, we had nothing for women's

16:01.363 --> 16:10.633
fitness room equipment, so to speak.

16:11.677 --> 16:28.836
I'd say of the

16:11.677 --> 16:28.836
kids on this campus that worked out on 
cardiovascular or in the weight room, probably

16:11.677 --> 16:28.836
70% of them worked out off campus, 30% on campus. 
Now it's probably 80% on campus and 20% off.

16:32.901 --> 16:36.104
Probably more than 80% of people who use that room. 
That was a big hit for them. If you were doing it

16:38.018 --> 16:45.250
again now, is there anything you'd do differently 
based on your experience? In reality, that's one

16:45.270 --> 16:49.817
of the questions all of my colleagues ask, what 
would you do differently? And I think our planning

16:49.837 --> 16:56.668
processes and the architects we worked with, it 
was open enough and we asked enough questions as we

16:49.837 --> 16:56.668
went. There's one thing we missed probably, two 
things. Our outdoor pool area's a little small and

17:01.222 --> 17:07.605
we knew that at that point in time we weren't 
willing to give up parking at the time. Our outdoor

17:08.810 --> 17:11.299
recreation area, or customer service areas 
should have been right here. At that time, we let

17:16.942 --> 17:22.352
the overhead door and its ugliness dominate our 
thought. Instead of putting it here, we put it

17:22.692 --> 17:27.762
there so it's at the back of the building so we don't 
care what it looks like. We could have figured that

17:28.443 --> 17:32.190
out, we just weren't smart enough at the time, but 
other than that, Most people when they build these

17:32.170 --> 17:36.938
things don't build them big enough and we really 
hit the mark pretty close. There's times when

17:37.278 --> 17:42.387
we're overcrowded but most of the time it's we 
probably hit it closer than anybody did. So

17:43.248 --> 17:44.871
construction started when? March of 92. And it's 
open? Actually March of 93 because we opened in

17:49.658 --> 17:54.867
August of 95. And what was the reaction 
nationally? within among the knowledgeable

17:58.428 --> 18:03.777
people to this facility. Well, it's interesting 
because there's a little bit of jealousy about

18:03.797 --> 18:15.738
that and

18:03.797 --> 18:15.738
Georgia opened a facility that they say is 400,000 
square feet. What's this one? reality is georgia

18:21.091 --> 18:47.740
has a lot of physical education and laboratory 
space and varsity space in there and our building

18:21.091 --> 18:47.740
for recreation is bigger than theirs there's 
again on this tour this weekend they said yours is

18:21.091 --> 18:47.740
so much bigger than georgia's so they have a big 
building yours is bigger and that's the realities

18:21.091 --> 18:47.740
i've looked i haven't seen a layout of there but 
i've seen the listing of the recreation spaces and

18:21.091 --> 18:47.740
we have more is is this one looked upon nationally 
with It's the best. It really is. And what

18:52.326 --> 19:07.578
happened, what I was starting to say, there was a 
young graduate assistant at Maryland, I think,

18:52.326 --> 19:07.578
that did an email survey, which facility is the 
best, which program is the best, and we came out

18:52.326 --> 19:07.578
number one in both. Oh, really? This is amongst our 
colleagues. And then after she published that,

19:11.563 --> 19:17.011
then she got ridiculed for it. Now wait a minute. We 
didn't have the opportunity. Well, everybody had

19:19.414 --> 19:21.277
the opportunity because it was on a listserv. If 
you're on a listserv, you had the opportunity to

19:21.838 --> 19:23.700
respond. Who would be some of the other close 
runners up? Texas is probably number two. Ohio

19:29.749 --> 19:32.132
State is going to be real good. We spent $36 million 
on this. They're going to spend $135 million on

19:34.395 --> 19:36.358
this. Wow. And they're a school about our size. 
They're in, you know, 40,000. Just a little bit

19:41.364 --> 19:42.825
bigger, not much. Yeah. But Texas, they built the 
rec center, and then they remodeled Gregory. And

19:49.152 --> 19:51.515
between the two, they're pretty nice. They're 
still in second place. So Gregory is part of their

19:55.919 --> 19:59.763
intramural facilities now? Right. And the 
interesting thing about Gregory is they did the

20:02.106 --> 20:06.951
rec center, and it's pretty plain Jane. Then we did 
this building, and then they did Gregory. And if

20:11.799 --> 20:16.806
you go out and look at Gregory, you'll see a lot of 
things that we did here that they tried to copy in

20:11.799 --> 20:16.806
Gregory. Even though it was remodeled, they tried 
to do it. And they did a darn good job of it, I think.

20:21.652 --> 20:34.828
The other facilities that have been built 
recently are probably, except for Georgia, are so

20:21.652 --> 20:34.828
small that it doesn't, Arizona and Arizona State 
still have nice buildings.

20:37.087 --> 20:39.530
Trying to think who, Ohio State's gonna be the next 
one. Have there, in intramurals, and

20:40.571 --> 20:50.683
particularly with this facility, have y'all ever 
had any celebrity visitors who have used any of the

20:40.571 --> 20:50.683
facilities? George Bush. And he's been here 
several times. What did he? He uses the Wake

21:01.316 --> 21:04.680
Fitness Room and walks on the track. first time he 
came didn't get anything done because students

21:05.217 --> 21:25.386
had to talk to him more recently they allowed him to 
get his work out in what kind of arrangements have

21:05.217 --> 21:25.386
to be made by y'all we we get we worked out 
membership for he and his wife and i think 10 secret

21:05.217 --> 21:25.386
service I think when they came over there was more 
like four people at a time. Ten Secret Service

21:30.782 --> 21:32.545
members had memberships. What kind of time notice 
do y'all get? None? No, they just drop in. They just

21:37.813 --> 21:38.554
drop in? Have there been any students that almost 
dropped their teeth? Well, you know, the first

21:45.705 --> 21:49.230
time it came, everybody wanted to chat with him and 
they did and he was very gracious. But what they

21:53.415 --> 22:07.008
tell me from downstairs is that most of the time 
when he's come the last two or three times, people

21:53.415 --> 22:07.008
have been very cordial and they say hello and you 
know they're happy, they're really happy he's

21:53.415 --> 22:07.008
here but they understand he's here to work out too. 
And he's always been very, very cordial out there.

22:10.092 --> 22:11.833
Always, always. We had some

22:17.324 --> 22:19.848
WWF is over here, the wrestling. We had about three 
or four of their people come over and left one

22:19.868 --> 22:23.393
afternoon. Oh, really? Yeah. Okay. See, Ray 
Childress has been here, I believe. A few sports

22:29.442 --> 22:32.046
celebrities. Any entertainers that came over to 
work out before their performance or anything?

22:38.452 --> 22:40.014
Not that I'm aware of. I would guess that Clay 
Walker's probably been here, but I don't, you

22:40.434 --> 22:46.722
know, we didn't know about him at the time. He's 
around here so much. Any regents and or

22:48.644 --> 22:53.069
legislators?

22:56.033 --> 22:58.495
Well, we gave Fred Brown a tour here not too long 
ago. Don Powell and... He's in a group of people in

23:05.013 --> 23:15.335
Houston, I forget the name of the group, but this 
was on their tour one day when they came up here.

23:15.355 --> 23:18.362
They visited here, the Core Center and the Bush 
Library. He was in my tour group, so we're giving

23:19.704 --> 23:25.637
him a good tour. All right, looking back over these 
27 years, one of the key decisions was obviously

23:26.360 --> 23:32.449
this structure. What were some other, now as you 
recall, what were some other key decisions y'all

23:32.909 --> 23:39.359
made regarding intramurals?

23:45.788 --> 23:55.422
Well, I think the first thing was to try to create

23:45.788 --> 23:55.422
sports opportunities for everybody. revising 
the rules so it wasn't quite as physical out there

23:56.093 --> 24:08.546
and it was more fun by involving women, I think was a 
key point.

24:16.275 --> 24:22.962
I've continued to focus on quality training, 
quality sports equipment, just to quality

24:23.245 --> 24:49.590
experience for all our students that was one of the 
commitments i made when i first came here whatever

24:23.245 --> 24:49.590
the best sports equipment is kids are going to have 
that to play with

24:23.245 --> 24:49.590
and now we're trying to do the same thing with 
facilities too i think building building the

24:23.245 --> 24:49.590
glided outdoor field space was critical to the 
intramural program it still is And it's now a

24:50.330 --> 24:53.555
pretty cool sports club program. We're 
continuing to expand out there with play fields.

25:03.510 --> 25:08.257
Things changed so much when this building came 
online. Because we went from below the radar scope

25:09.458 --> 25:15.307
to being premier. This building is used almost 
every Almost every donor that's on campus gets a

25:19.439 --> 25:22.463
tour of this building. Many, if not all faculty, 
who are being recruited get a tour of this

25:24.185 --> 25:29.011
building. And I didn't realize how much that was 
until Evelyn started giving me the numbers we had.

25:37.141 --> 25:38.963
I asked her, how many have kept through here? The 
next morning she called, well, we had two this

25:39.324 --> 25:41.326
morning. And this was at a time when we expected 
that many people to be on campus.

25:49.730 --> 25:55.398
Students, I go to mothers club meetings, I say how 
many of you have been to the rec center? 90 to 95%. I

25:56.679 --> 26:00.645
go to fish camp, freshman, how many of you have been 
to the rec center? 90 to 95%. I go to A&M meetings,

26:01.265 --> 26:07.494
A&M club meetings, how many of you have been to the 
rec center? Our students, we give tours all the

26:07.514 --> 26:10.658
time, we did. 300 tours in the first eight months we 
were open organized tours to 22 000 people it's got

26:12.325 --> 26:35.785
a bigger sense but not only do we give tours but our 
students give tours to their parents to their

26:12.325 --> 26:35.785
brothers and sisters to the friends from high 
school or whatever and there's tours going on here

26:12.325 --> 26:35.785
all the time game day is really wild oh i hadn't 
thought about that all kinds of people down there

26:12.325 --> 26:35.785
we had We'll have 1,500 to 2,000 people 
participating. We'll have more than that of

26:39.455 --> 26:45.024
people touring the building on game day. The place 
is full. Now, when is the building not open?

26:53.056 --> 26:57.283
We close on Thanksgiving and the Friday after 
Thanksgiving. We close on Christmas Eve and

26:58.104 --> 27:04.354
Christmas Day, New Year's Eve and New Year's Day. 
we used to close on five days a year now it's now

27:06.106 --> 27:31.776
maybe seven or eight all right and is it open seven 
24 hours a day no we are open at six except on and

27:06.106 --> 27:31.776
close at midnight except on saturday we open at 
eight and sunday we open at uh ten and then in the

27:06.106 --> 27:31.776
summertime there are a little bit less than that 
but but that's our general So, but it is open seven

27:32.566 --> 27:37.556
days a week, at least. Our philosophy is that 
recreation facilities need to be open when

27:37.576 --> 27:44.028
everybody else is playing. And that's why we've 
been there for a while. We were only closed two days

27:47.756 --> 27:49.800
a year. My staff has said this. so hard to get people 
to work, and some of them we've extended that a

27:53.069 --> 27:57.455
little bit. If you were being challenged by a 
self-appointed critic, say at a legislature or

27:57.475 --> 28:18.503
something or other, what argument would you give, 
what justification would you give for

27:57.475 --> 28:18.503
intramurals and its facilities?

28:19.107 --> 28:25.233
First of all, it's a program that's desired by the 
student body.

28:25.254 --> 28:31.240
Secondly, it's a program that fits in well with 
college atmosphere. We've done a study, a grade

28:31.981 --> 28:36.766
point study, every semester we've been open. 
We've taken our users, our student users, and

28:38.488 --> 28:43.473
split them into quartiles and compared their 
grade point average. And every semester,

28:44.314 --> 28:47.477
undergraduates The students who use the rec 
center must have the highest grade point ever. The

28:52.379 --> 28:56.963
only thing that tells you is people who are active 
are gonna be successful. So we are not in the way of

28:56.983 --> 29:00.566
creating a quality education. In fact, we are 
probably one of the best attractors for quality

29:01.507 --> 29:06.392
people. You put up a facility like this, people who 
really are active say, yeah, I wanna go there, look

29:07.293 --> 29:15.000
at that place. And this is how Ohio State got so much 
money for theirs. They were losing ground to, they

29:20.966 --> 29:29.337
went from second to fifth choice among Ohio 
seniors on where to go. And everybody that they'd

29:29.958 --> 29:35.085
lost ground to had built a new rec center. So they 
used that as part of the case. But the reality is,

29:36.567 --> 29:40.532
the people that they wanted to get, they weren't 
getting. They were getting, the students that

29:40.512 --> 29:47.325
they were still getting in Ohio State were their 
second and third tier students, not the first

29:40.512 --> 29:47.325
tier. Well, it would also be correct to argue that 
this, in effect, is an investment that the

29:47.345 --> 30:01.913
students, if they didn't have this facility, 
might use their energy and activities in things

29:47.345 --> 30:01.913
far less positive. Exactly. There's little on 
this campus that is more positive in the use of

30:02.696 --> 30:10.028
leisure time. And students are going to have 
leisure time. They are. And there's nothing that

30:12.813 --> 30:15.597
can be more positive than this. There's a lot of 
things that are more negative. The other part of

30:19.424 --> 30:24.472
this is essentially the students are funding this 
themselves. It's not like we're asking for money

30:24.572 --> 30:27.597
from... the general tax base. This is coming from 
students and their parents. So that today it's

30:33.368 --> 30:36.053
50th semester? And what would that $50 buy if they 
went out to a private recreational facility?

30:44.789 --> 30:47.293
Month and a half. The last four months here. Let's 
see, as another example of a positive, Give two or

30:54.172 --> 31:07.006
three examples of the worst problems you've ever 
had to work out of intramurals.

31:07.026 --> 31:13.253
There must have been a scuffle or two at some 
football game or something or other. Well, the

31:15.636 --> 31:21.943
worst one was the worst one that I actually was 
involved in was up in Texas. No, no, but here. Well,

31:25.070 --> 31:27.059
let me tell you a story. We have some scuffles. You 
know, we probably, in the 27 years I've been here,
