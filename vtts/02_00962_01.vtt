Mr. Barber by Scott Burnham. On the 26th of 
November at Mr. Barber's house concerning the

00:05.156 --> 00:17.973
Vietnam War, in the interest of accumulating 
knowledge about the war, I'm going to donate this

00:05.156 --> 00:17.973
tape to the Texas A&M Oral History Collection in 
the University Archives. Is this all right with

00:18.313 --> 00:19.074
you? Yes. First of all, I'd like to get a little 
biographical data, such as where and when you were

00:21.157 --> 00:27.105
born and some of your background education. Okay. 
I was born in Orange, New Jersey. On October 4th,

00:31.958 --> 00:37.745
1929, my father was an engineer for the New York 
Telephone Company. I went to school in public

00:38.946 --> 00:45.714
schools in New York through my junior year in high 
school. And after World War II, shortly after

00:46.975 --> 00:52.421
World War II, my parents bought a farm in New 
Hampshire. And I went to school my senior year up

00:53.502 --> 01:01.071
there and then went to the University of New 
Hampshire. Graduated in 1951 with a degree in

01:01.287 --> 01:05.792
economics. I was also an ROTC graduate. Okay, and 
so when did you just come straight out of ROTC and

01:10.458 --> 01:15.504
join the military? Yes, I went straight out of the 
university into the Air Force and then into pilot

01:15.885 --> 01:24.375
training in 1951. Okay, and can you briefly 
explain your military career before Vietnam?

01:31.143 --> 01:31.243
Okay.

01:34.413 --> 01:43.925
I finished pilot training in 1953 and went 
straight to Korea and was there for the last five

01:34.413 --> 01:43.925
months of the war. Then the unit moved to Japan, was 
there for about nine months, came back to the

01:45.968 --> 01:59.205
United States and spent about ten years in fighter 
units in the United States and Europe. I was a

02:00.670 --> 02:09.881
combat crew for Tactical Air Command, the 
Strategic Air Command, and the United States Air

02:00.670 --> 02:09.881
Forces in Europe. After about eight years, I got 
into the accident investigation business and I

02:11.583 --> 02:27.623
did that in addition to crew duty for about three 
years.

02:28.717 --> 02:30.539
There was a lot of work involved with that. I didn't 
particularly like it. Those accident

02:33.122 --> 02:41.351
investigations took about 30 days, and some years 
we'd have 12, 13 accidents in the unit. I found very

02:41.892 --> 02:46.397
little time for my family. I decided to go to night 
school, which I did. I took a bunch of math courses

02:49.360 --> 02:54.606
and applied for a special program. with the Air 
Force Institute of Technology. I went to Texas

02:57.487 --> 03:01.551
Tech for two years under an Air Force program. Got a 
degree in industrial engineering. Then when I got

03:05.634 --> 03:11.780
out of school, the Cuban Missile Crisis was still 
upon us. I went back into the F4 program and for a

03:13.021 --> 03:20.668
couple of years at MacDill in Florida. Went to 
Europe, worked in safety education. for a couple

03:24.826 --> 03:44.432
years, went to Spain, did staff work for 16th Air 
Force, the Mediterranean Command there in Spain,

03:24.826 --> 03:44.432
then went to Korea, or excuse me, went to Vietnam 
for a year in Edwards Air Force Base for a year and

03:24.826 --> 03:44.432
retired in 1971. Okay. About your involvement in 
Vietnam, as a fighter pilot, what sort of

03:46.816 --> 03:54.546
background knowledge did you have of Vietnam as 
far as our involvement there? Well, I had spent, of

03:57.456 --> 04:06.525
course, three years in Europe and immediately 
before my tour in Vietnam. And what we were exposed

04:07.206 --> 04:16.716
to over there was the Armed Forces Radio Network, 
the Stars and Stripes newspaper. Of course, we got

04:17.997 --> 04:20.820
periodicals like Time and so forth. But the 
majority of our news and what we got came from the

04:21.256 --> 04:28.184
armed forces press. So I didn't know much about the 
country. I was pretty well up to speed on the war

04:32.469 --> 04:38.496
itself because, of course, I was interested in it. 
And I worked with people who had been to Vietnam,

04:38.716 --> 04:42.721
who had come back. And I felt like I was aware of the 
conflict, the reasons for it. but as far as the

04:51.142 --> 04:57.207
culture and so forth about Vietnam, I hadn't 
studied. Okay. Where and when were you stationed

04:59.269 --> 05:04.794
in Vietnam and what types of planes did you fly 
there? I was stationed at Da Nang Air Base from

05:04.814 --> 05:18.106
August of 69 to August of 70 and it was all F-4 fire 
bomber work during that year. Okay. In bombing,

05:21.027 --> 05:32.882
what were your objectives and targets, as well as 
we learned a lot about the restricted zones, about

05:21.027 --> 05:32.882
how for one month this zone you could bomb there and 
then you couldn't because of the politics of it.

05:33.363 --> 05:36.407
What are your thoughts on that, and what were some 
of your objectives and targets? Well, first of

05:36.947 --> 05:41.433
all, our targets were very specific. We would go to 
a briefing. We were given a target folder, and they

05:43.916 --> 05:49.363
said, this is your target for today. This was most 
of my involvement. I didn't sit much of the strip

05:52.457 --> 05:55.099
alert business. I had a full-time job in addition 
to my flying duties. So, I avoided sitting out

05:59.303 --> 06:10.613
there for like some of them did for six or eight 
hours and you might get you might get flushed out

05:59.303 --> 06:10.613
and go someplace and you might not depending on how 
the war was going. So, we would go, we would have

06:12.455 --> 06:17.820
specific targets assigned. We would almost 
invariably worked with a forward air controller

06:20.022 --> 06:45.304
in a light aircraft who was controlling the strike 
and he would he would mark the target or close to it

06:20.022 --> 06:45.304
with a rocket or a phosphorus rocket and so we were 
you know I guess there probably were restricted

06:20.022 --> 06:45.304
zones where you could go in and out out of But that 
was far above us as far as we were the operators and

06:45.588 --> 06:50.654
that really didn't mean much to us. We went to the 
target that they gave us. We had primarily, we were

06:53.097 --> 06:59.265
after storage areas, enemy supply storage areas. 
The Ho Chi Minh Trail was, I would say, probably 80%

07:00.506 --> 07:09.537
of our work. suspected troop concentrations, 
barracks and so forth. Most of the time you

07:14.086 --> 07:18.750
couldn't see what you were going after because of 
the jungle. We'd go after road cuts once in a while,

07:18.770 --> 07:25.977
roads on the sides of hills, mountains. We laid 
mines on rivers, roads. We escorted

07:33.804 --> 07:39.709
reconnaissance aircraft into North Vietnam. We

07:41.292 --> 07:49.904
escorted B-52, well we flew air cover for the B-52s 
every once in a while. They weren't operating in

07:49.944 --> 07:54.230
North Vietnam very much while I was there. We had 
some radar drops where we would be controlled by

07:55.812 --> 08:03.864
radar and we'd go in just like the B-52s did. We

08:04.064 --> 08:09.932
occasionally go after a gun emplacement or some 
specific target that somebody would divert us to.

08:16.641 --> 08:24.011
Were these areas mostly north of the DMZ or were 
they in South Vietnam? Most of our work was out of

08:24.411 --> 08:26.694
country work. It was in Laos, Cambodia and some in 
North Vietnam.

08:34.752 --> 08:36.273
What kind of bombs did you drop? We learned about 
the smart bombs and all the new technology they

08:36.314 --> 08:40.437
had. We didn't have many. I think that most of the 
smart bombs went to specialized units. As far as I

08:45.903 --> 08:47.464
know, we didn't have any. I don't know anybody that 
dropped any. I don't recall seeing any. But we had

08:52.029 --> 08:55.132
conventional bombs. The Mark 82s, I think they 
were 750 and 500 pound bombs. most of the time with

09:01.313 --> 09:05.318
regular fuses, sometimes with fuse extenders. We 
dropped quite a few CBUs, the cluster bombs, that

09:06.419 --> 09:19.854
would come open at, I think, 1,500, 2,500 feet, and 
they would scatter out a circle of bomblets 1,500

09:06.419 --> 09:19.854
feet or so. Some of them were instantaneous. Some 
of them were delayed timing.

09:27.537 --> 09:29.159
Did you ever encounter a resistance? You said you 
flew with the A-52s and stuff. What type of

09:33.666 --> 09:38.373
resistance did you normally find? Mostly 
aircraft, light anti-aircraft fire. We didn't

09:42.179 --> 09:45.724
see any heavy anti-aircraft, the black smoke 
ones.

09:49.149 --> 09:57.021
They would, most of the time, they wouldn't bother 
you until you were down on a bomb run, and then

09:49.149 --> 09:57.021
they'd shoot at you. there was a lot of ground fire 
and you really didn't appreciate it in the daytime

09:57.845 --> 10:05.993
because you didn't see it. You would see the puffs 
from the anti-aircraft. At night, on the night

10:10.017 --> 10:16.963
missions, you would see an awful lot of ground fire 
in some areas. Amazing amount of fire that was

10:18.285 --> 10:23.970
coming up out of the countryside. Was it a viable 
effort? Was it a main concern of yours? Would it be a

10:31.868 --> 10:34.574
possibility of being shut down by these? You're 
pretty well aware of the odds. It was always in your

10:37.300 --> 10:43.393
mind, just like having an automobile accident is 
in your mind. you knew pretty well what the history

10:44.099 --> 10:55.409
of the outfit was, and you found out right away how 
many people had been lost, how many aircraft

10:44.099 --> 10:55.409
they'd lost, and so forth. So we didn't really have 
a big loss rate. I probably maybe lost, out of the

11:00.053 --> 11:08.360
three squadrons there, we might have lost one crew 
a month. Maybe 2% of the people weren't going to

11:09.441 --> 11:12.604
make it. Another 10% were probably going to have 
accidents. Accidents were a lot bigger problem

11:16.606 --> 11:19.949
than the combat losses were. And I felt that there 
were some accidents that were probably rated as

11:21.351 --> 11:29.318
combat losses that really weren't.

11:32.201 --> 11:34.543
Okay, back to the bombing aspect. What effect do 
you think the bombing had on the enemy as far as the

11:35.244 --> 11:41.410
psychology of the enemy or their will to fight? I 
think that it probably had a very significant

11:42.605 --> 11:47.991
effect on them.

11:51.295 --> 12:02.488
I know the North Vietnamese, from what I've read 
since I came back, were extremely afraid of the

11:51.295 --> 12:02.488
B-52 attacks. And they were certainly something. 
You've probably seen films of that. They would lay

12:06.693 --> 12:12.139
a stream of 500-pound bombs from here to Highway 
71. a mile or so of them, just complete

12:12.862 --> 12:15.866
devastation. And, of course, we weren't that 
devastating to them, but we carried as many bombs

12:16.948 --> 12:27.383
on an F-4 as a B-17 did during World War II. So we 
could, you know, we'd hang around for, we'd be on

12:28.244 --> 12:36.416
the target for 15 minutes probably while we made a 
number of runs. And I think that, of course, we were

12:37.458 --> 12:41.063
on the receiving end of some of the aircraft fire 
too. They'd rocket the base every once in a while

12:42.713 --> 12:51.065
and that has a psychological effect on everybody. 
You know, your chance of getting hit are kind of

12:51.526 --> 12:57.755
like a lightning strike, but just the same, it's 
unnerving. Now, what we did to them day after day

12:57.795 --> 13:10.915
and along the trail there, I don't mean just the Air 
Force, the Marines and the Navy and everybody else

12:57.795 --> 13:10.915
was over there and it was tremendous effort, and I 
think that it probably had a very significant

13:11.637 --> 13:21.546
effect on their morale and their ability to do 
things. Okay, as far as the fighter pilots, did you

13:23.587 --> 13:29.493
ever like assist ground troops? Were you ever 
called in? No, you know that the in-country work in

13:32.035 --> 13:41.543
South Vietnam, for example, the Marines had at Chu 
Lai flew all their missions in country and I

13:42.164 --> 13:48.393
imagine they did a lot of ground support. The only 
direct ground support mission that I was involved

13:48.994 --> 13:56.565
in was over in Cambodia. I think it was the first day 
that we went into Cambodia.

14:03.680 --> 14:10.871
We had been dropping what was called hard 
ordnance, conventional bombs and so forth. And

14:10.891 --> 14:15.357
all of a sudden, we switched to what they called 
soft ordnance. They were bombs that were dropped

14:15.398 --> 14:17.421
from low level. They had special fins on them that 
came out kind of like an inverted flower petal when

14:18.041 --> 14:27.315
you dropped the bomb. And that would slow them down 
and you could drop them further. I don't know,

14:30.781 --> 14:32.623
1,500 feet or something. Most of that stuff we were 
dropping from, I don't know, 7,000 or 8,000 feet

14:32.703 --> 14:38.530
probably.

14:40.172 --> 14:52.787
But on that particular mission, there was a group 
of houses and some friendlies over in a tree line

14:40.172 --> 14:52.787
that we were told about, and we were told to take out 
one of those houses. Were these... The troops that

14:55.165 --> 14:57.027
you were assisting, were they U.S. troops? I 
assume so. I assume they were U.S. because that was

14:58.730 --> 15:02.695
mostly a U.S. operation. The Vietnamese were 
sneaking across the border into Cambodia and

15:03.135 --> 15:17.934
using it as a sanctuary and then they'd come in, hit 
and run, and go back over there and I guess it was

15:03.135 --> 15:17.934
President Nixon who decided that we'd go in there 
and clean them out. I don't think they did. I think

15:19.536 --> 15:21.679
they left before we got there. You

15:22.722 --> 15:32.290
said that a large percentage of your job in Vietnam 
was more of a staff officer or other duties. Could

15:33.051 --> 15:35.974
you kind of briefly describe some of those duties? 
Well, I was the chief of safety for the wing there at

15:35.994 --> 15:42.299
Da Nang. Da Nang Air Base, half the base was, one 
side of the base was Air Force, the other side was

15:43.560 --> 15:52.088
Marines. the Chief of Safety for the Air Force 
side.

15:58.729 --> 16:07.140
Primarily my job was to advise and assist the 
commander there in the accident prevention

15:58.729 --> 16:07.140
business. So we did a number of things. We would 
investigate accidents and incidents. We would

16:13.848 --> 16:19.695
respond to all kinds of problems and questions. I 
had about eight people working for me. They did a

16:24.039 --> 16:25.641
lot of inspections. We would assist other 
inspectors when they came in. Air Force people

16:29.625 --> 16:38.553
were in there regularly, so were the Pacific Air 
Force people and 7th Air Force. Everybody and his

16:38.573 --> 16:43.338
dog came over there to see what was going on, and 
we'd escort them around. We had a safety council. a

16:47.722 --> 16:54.133
wing-based safety council once a month and that 
generated a lot of activity for us. We pretty near

16:54.194 --> 17:03.330
stayed busy doing all the homework we got out of 
that meeting

16:54.194 --> 17:03.330
getting ready for the next one.

17:05.534 --> 17:10.202
We've dealt with careerism as a problem in the 
services there. Did you observe any examples of

17:10.672 --> 17:15.356
careerism at the expense of the war effort? I don't 
think at the expense of the war effort. Sometimes

17:22.021 --> 17:36.514
that's difficult to interpret, but I can remember 
individuals that I thought put their

17:22.021 --> 17:36.514
self-interest in front of other people's. I 
remember one guy who flew a large number of escort

17:42.548 --> 17:49.738
missions into North Vietnam, escorting the 
reconnaissance aircraft. And really, those were

17:49.758 --> 17:51.521
nothing missions. Your job was to go along with the 
reconnaissance airplanes. They were low-level

17:57.489 --> 17:58.651
missions. And if anybody shot at them, why, we were 
to retaliate against whoever shot at them. Well,

18:06.162 --> 18:07.443
they never got shot at. And at least, you know, 
during that time period, they didn't. So, all it

18:12.485 --> 18:18.533
was was kind of a dry run operation.

18:19.975 --> 18:32.293
The hooker to the thing was that missions into 
North Vietnam counted twice as much for awards and

18:19.975 --> 18:32.293
decorations as missions in Laos, which really 
wasn't right. Laos should have counted four times

18:32.313 --> 18:37.480
as much as North Vietnam, but at that time, because 
the shooting was off for the majority of my tour.

18:43.140 --> 18:51.989
There was a time period there when they did go back 
in on the north, but I'm talking about most of the

18:43.140 --> 18:51.989
time, and especially on those reconnaissance 
missions. But that type of thing was something

18:52.009 --> 18:56.674
that I didn't respect the guy for. I thought it was 
crappy of him, but you see that type of thing in any

18:56.754 --> 19:03.280
career. Opportunist is going to jump on it and try 
and make the most of it. Also, another aspect of the

19:08.915 --> 19:20.206
war was the one-year tour duties, which seemed to 
not really give the officers in particular a

19:08.915 --> 19:20.206
chance. In the first three months, they'd be 
getting used to it, and then they'd only have four

19:20.226 --> 19:27.412
months while they were there, and then the last 
time they'd be packing up. What did you think of the

19:28.193 --> 19:30.135
one-year tour duties? Did you think it was a good 
idea? Well, they had to balance out the other

19:31.276 --> 19:37.622
requirements all over the all over the world with 
what was going on in Vietnam and I thought that the

19:38.024 --> 19:47.537
one-year tour was appropriate. If you wanted to 
stay, you could. I could have stayed if I wanted to.

19:57.130 --> 19:58.272
And a lot of people did. People came home, they went 
back but there were No, you were away from your

20:04.906 --> 20:10.754
family for a year, like I left a wife and five kids 
and went over there and stayed for a year. I thought

20:10.814 --> 20:15.340
it was a fair amount of duty time. You worked seven 
days a week, and it was an awful grind, really, as

20:15.901 --> 20:24.233
far as the workload went. So I really didn't have 
any argument with the one-year tour. Okay. There

20:32.023 --> 20:33.225
was another concept of the idea of getting your 
ticket punched, as they used to say. We talked to

20:36.931 --> 20:50.730
this one guy that was in the Air Force Academy, and 
everybody that was there was saying, well, get

20:36.931 --> 20:50.730
over to Vietnam now, go get your ticket punched, 
because it's the only way you'll ever become a

20:36.931 --> 20:50.730
general or you'll ever rise up in the ranks. Did you 
ever see any people just coming over to maybe

20:51.811 --> 20:57.899
getting a soft job just to put Vietnam on the 
resume? No, I don't think so, because... You never

21:01.623 --> 21:05.848
could tell what kind of job you were going to get 
when you got there. You might be shipped over as one

21:06.309 --> 21:10.915
thing and wind up as something completely 
different. So there was no doubt about it that if

21:12.297 --> 21:23.911
you wanted to advance in the military, anybody in 
the military, you better get that kind of duty

21:12.297 --> 21:23.911
behind you. And it was important to everybody's 
career, but you know, if you're being in the

21:31.897 --> 21:36.101
military, that's what you're there for. It's kind 
of like being a fireman. You don't go to the fires,

21:37.883 --> 21:41.447
there's no sense in being in the fire department. 
So, you know, I realize that some people felt, may

21:41.467 --> 21:49.535
have felt that way, but I didn't. I certainly, I was 
anxious to go because it was something that was

21:59.977 --> 22:10.129
part of your job and I was very surprised when I got 
sent from Florida to Europe for three years

21:59.977 --> 22:10.129
because the war was on when I was in Florida. We were 
sending units out of MacDill to Southeast Asia for

22:10.350 --> 22:24.607
90 days or something like that in rotating duty and 
the word was that nobody was going to go any place

22:10.350 --> 22:24.607
but Southeast Asia. When I got my orders to Europe I 
was very surprised and disappointed because I

22:30.250 --> 22:38.340
figured what would happen would be I would spend 
three years in Europe and then go to Southeast

22:30.250 --> 22:38.340
Asia, which is exactly what happened. It was kind 
of an ass-backwards way to do things. Okay. In

22:42.865 --> 22:51.055
dealing with Arvin at the South Vietnamese 
troops, did you have to deal with Arvin fighter

22:42.865 --> 22:51.055
pilots or was it strictly U.S.? Well, we had the 
Vietnamese on the base with us and we were kind of

22:51.215 --> 22:57.743
co-mingled with them. they would have an 
operations building right next to ours. At least

23:02.897 --> 23:11.804
they did at one time and on the flight line they had 
their helicopter area and their bombs stashed all

23:02.897 --> 23:11.804
over the place. We were always kind of leery of them 
because it was kind of, it appeared to be kind of

23:12.865 --> 23:23.474
loosey goosey but they, we really didn't have much 
to do with the Vietnamese. There was one

23:24.135 --> 23:27.898
Vietnamese captain who we saw quite a bit of. He was 
their flight safety officer. And he would come

23:32.766 --> 23:38.113
down and talk to us about various problems every 
once in a while, or he'd want something. He was a

23:38.654 --> 23:40.156
pretty good guy. He'd been through the flight 
safety officer's course at the University of

23:40.176 --> 23:46.104
Southern California. The main obstacle with the 
Vietnamese was language. Their language is

23:49.428 --> 23:51.992
impossible. And one of the smartest people I ever 
knew couldn't master it. I didn't even try, and I

23:55.116 --> 23:58.240
don't know anybody that smoked even a you know, 
more than a few words of Vietnamese. And we were not

24:02.173 --> 24:08.183
allowed to socialize with the Vietnamese 
officers. So, we never went to their houses, they

24:09.164 --> 24:13.831
never came to our parties, we didn't go to theirs. 
It was completely, you know, separate but equal

24:14.412 --> 24:18.258
type operation. What do you think about that? Do 
you think it would have been a better idea to try and

24:20.561 --> 24:24.868
maybe be a little bit more involved? I guess, but 
you know, I think there were too many obstacles to

24:25.321 --> 24:29.004
it. One thing, you never know. There was so much 
enemy activity around, so many people that, you

24:31.827 --> 24:42.997
know, the guy would be the gardener during the day 
and at night he'd be out firing the rockets into the

24:31.827 --> 24:42.997
base. And the same with the house girl and all that. 
You never knew who to trust because of the

24:45.139 --> 24:50.264
guerrilla type operations that they did. And I 
don't understand why You know, the ban was on the

24:55.342 --> 24:58.869
fraternization business. I suspect partly was 
because of the terrorist activities. Maybe

25:06.045 --> 25:08.951
they'd had some real bad experiences with that. It 
may have been over the women, I don't know what it

25:09.712 --> 25:13.300
was all about, but It just, they didn't seem 
particularly anxious to do it either. They kind of

25:17.810 --> 25:20.072
left us alone, and we left them alone. That's my 
experience on one air base. It may have been

25:23.857 --> 25:25.899
different. I know people that lived with the 
Vietnamese. There's a guy in our office who was in

25:29.063 --> 25:31.626
Special Forces. He was out in the communities, you 
know, in the Jones. As far as the missions, where

25:36.352 --> 25:40.317
they originated from, Was there any South 
Vietnamese input? Did they say, well, we think you

25:43.884 --> 25:46.368
had a bomb here? I think that there was at a very high 
level. I think the Vietnamese had to say something

25:50.113 --> 25:55.640
about what we went after in country. But of course, 
that wasn't our concern. We were out of country

25:59.105 --> 26:02.710
work most of it. So I don't think they had much to say 
about that. They may have. They could care less

26:09.102 --> 26:11.505
what we did over there. What we were trying to do was 
shut off the supply that's coming down the Ho Chi

26:12.646 --> 26:17.272
Minh Trail. And they should have been thrilled 
that we were doing that. Do you ever think that

26:21.958 --> 26:27.284
there was a sense of ingratitude amongst the South 
Vietnamese? No, I don't think so. The South

26:30.488 --> 26:37.557
Vietnamese, to me, just didn't appear very 
motivated about the whole damn thing. They seemed

26:38.971 --> 26:46.978
to me, I suspected

26:38.971 --> 26:46.978
they were politicians. I thought that they were 
probably

26:47.659 --> 26:56.727
on the order of Ferdinand Marcos in the 
Philippines.

27:00.751 --> 27:04.955
Probably on the take, probably half crooked. We 
probably put them in there, the ones that were

27:05.195 --> 27:08.758
there when I was there. and that just didn't seem to 
be too fired up about the war, but then again, I

27:09.734 --> 27:26.137
didn't, that's just a casual observance, because 
I didn't really have any real contact with the

27:09.734 --> 27:26.137
South Vietnamese officers, except this one guy. 
Okay, starting with the war in general, kind of on a

27:28.019 --> 27:38.053
big scale, did you feel the war was winnable at the 
time you were there, or do you, How would you

27:38.557 --> 27:43.381
describe a winnable situation given that 
country? Well, I think the United States could

27:43.401 --> 27:49.627
have won the war if we had wanted to, if we had been 
turned loose. I think with enough conventional

27:51.088 --> 27:56.773
forces, we could have taken over South Vietnam. 
Now, I'm not so sure we could have kept it, but we

27:57.674 --> 28:00.977
could have won it. It would have been a real tough go 
because the Vietnamese the VC and the North

28:08.138 --> 28:11.983
Vietnamese probably would have been right back in 
there. They were very innovative and clever and

28:12.824 --> 28:25.420
good guerrilla fighters and I think that they 
would have pulled a, they would have gotten back,

28:12.824 --> 28:25.420
we might have thrown them out, but I think they'd 
have come back in. They, we could have won it with,

28:26.842 --> 28:35.833
we could have won it by going into North Vietnam and 
that probably would have been with nuclear

28:36.522 --> 28:54.648
weapons and that would have certainly could have 
been done, but I think it would have opened up a

28:36.522 --> 28:54.648
scenario for a much bigger war and we'd have had 
other countries involved. Russia or China? The

28:57.031 --> 28:58.834
country wasn't prepared for that. The United 
States never would have supported that. The

29:02.057 --> 29:06.983
politicians knew it, and that's why we fought the 
limited war that we did. So you mentioned that we

29:07.864 --> 29:09.886
were held back. Who was holding us back? Was it 
Congress or was it the President? Well, I think

29:14.693 --> 29:21.421
basically it was the American people, and they 
were sending messages to the Congress, and the

29:14.693 --> 29:21.421
Congress was listening. And the press, of course, 
was against the war and probably will be against

29:22.322 --> 29:28.450
every war that we ever fight. That's just the 
nature of our liberal press, but there was no real

29:29.273 --> 29:39.907
support for the war like there was. I was a teenager 
in World War II and I remember the support that

29:40.067 --> 29:47.296
everybody gave to the war effort. There wasn't 10% 
of that in the Vietnam War. People just wanted it

29:51.481 --> 29:54.005
over with. They didn't want to see Americans over 
there dying and they didn't want to see their money

29:57.640 --> 30:08.015
spent on it and it was, you know, a losing cause 
almost from the beginning because there was no

29:57.640 --> 30:08.015
support. Who do you think you can blame for not 
having support? I mean, obviously, you know,

30:12.442 --> 30:18.992
during the World War II era, you know, the 
government had a lot to do with drumming up

30:12.442 --> 30:18.992
support. Do you think it was a fact that just the 
government was trying to fight this war and you

30:23.645 --> 30:26.389
know, just say, well, it's over there, don't worry 
about it? We didn't see the threat. The American

30:28.191 --> 30:30.234
people didn't see a threat from that. You know, it 
was the falling domino theory that, you know,

30:30.394 --> 30:43.211
Thailand would go, Cambodia would go, Vietnam or 
in the opposite order, and pretty soon, you know,

30:30.394 --> 30:43.211
we'd have them on our doorstep. Well, and that was, 
that part of the world was necessary to our

30:43.231 --> 30:52.403
national interests, we were led to believe. And I 
think to a certain extent that's true.

30:59.887 --> 31:03.052
The American people didn't perceive that as a real 
threat. Now they saw Hitler as a real threat. And

31:05.476 --> 31:07.700
they saw the Japanese as a real threat. Actually, 
the United States just sat around and was a good

31:07.720 --> 31:14.391
neighbor to Great Britain until the Japanese 
bomb. Pearl Harbor, and as the Japanese general

31:14.675 --> 31:19.740
said, we've awakened the sleeping giant. Well, 
nobody awakened us in Vietnam. We just, you know,

31:22.443 --> 31:30.952
we kind of muddled our way through, and there was no 
big cause to get us moving as a country. Also,

31:31.993 --> 31:43.045
some of the problems we've heard more later on in 
the war, in the 70s, late 70s, was the problem with

31:31.993 --> 31:43.045
drugs. I think it was more with the marine grunts 
and the actual fighting people, but did you ever

31:43.396 --> 31:53.371
encounter any problems with drugs? No, really I 
was kind of naive as far as the drug problem went.

32:01.583 --> 32:06.130
The Air Force, you know, it's a little different 
deal because We had people in a very controlled

32:07.814 --> 32:10.937
environment on an air base. You had all 
volunteers. By and large, you have people who are

32:12.278 --> 32:16.803
probably better educated. They're high school 
graduates, or at least. And they're working with

32:19.986 --> 32:26.152
pretty sophisticated equipment. There wasn't as 
big an awareness of the drug problem at that time.

32:30.916 --> 32:31.817
It was 20 years ago. I did see it one time. We got 
called out in the middle of the night and some guy

32:37.717 --> 32:42.461
had gotten hit by an airplane out on the runway. It 
was a Marine. They were of course on the other side.

32:46.605 --> 32:52.009
We had the Air Vietnam terminal on our side of the 
base and had a fried chicken place in it. And these

32:53.050 --> 33:01.757
guys had crossed the field, crossed the airfield, 
rather than go around the end of the runway, which

32:53.050 --> 33:01.757
probably would have been a five mile hike either 
way. They came directly across, which was maybe a

33:02.078 --> 33:07.302
mile, mile and a half. We're crossing the runway 
and an airplane landed and it hit one of them. The

33:12.718 --> 33:14.920
wing hit this guy in the head and killed him dead. 
And I went down to the, the Air Police had his buddy

33:16.342 --> 33:35.142
and they had him held down in their security office 
and they were waiting for the Marines to come pick

33:16.342 --> 33:35.142
him up and I went and talked to him and it was obvious 
he was just as stoned as you could possibly be. He

33:35.162 --> 33:36.664
was completely out of it. I mean, fixed air and 
just, you know, would hardly communicate and

33:37.319 --> 33:59.715
everything and they were blasted out of their 
minds on something and so, you know, that kind of

33:37.319 --> 33:59.715
woke me up a little bit to the drug problem, but I 
didn't see any evidence and I was in a position

33:37.319 --> 33:59.715
where I would have known had we, had they had a 
problem with drugs on the base. I worked closely

34:03.423 --> 34:10.555
with the people who were in charge of the whole 
thing and they just, you know, there wasn't any. If

34:10.575 --> 34:13.060
it was there, we sure as hell didn't know about it. 
So on the base, I mean it was more like, did you ever

34:13.080 --> 34:21.494
stray from the base or was it just pretty much like 
you had your own community there? We had our own

34:21.815 --> 34:22.957
community. I got off the base I can only think of one 
time. I think we went out to some communications

34:26.807 --> 34:32.794
facility that was a few miles off the base. We had to 
go through town and we stopped by and saw that China

34:32.814 --> 34:37.760
Beach operation. You've probably seen it on TV. 
The beach where the Marines came ashore. But going

34:43.247 --> 34:49.074
into town was not encouraged. In fact, I can't 
remember being restricted to base, but we

34:49.594 --> 34:54.340
probably were. There was no real need to go to town. 
We

34:58.753 --> 35:07.749
had what we needed on base and that really wasn't an 
attractive place to be.

35:10.734 --> 35:16.564
Concerning, we also dealt with the inter-service 
rivalries. which I guess goes on since the

35:17.287 --> 35:25.636
creation of all three services, but to what extent 
did you see that in Vietnam in the effort there?

35:25.676 --> 35:29.200
Well, I didn't see any inter-service rivalry. Of 
course, we had nothing to do with the Army at all.

35:32.163 --> 35:38.089
The Army was off there in the jungle someplace and 
we just didn't have anything to do with it. There

35:38.109 --> 35:39.951
weren't any Army people on the base. If there were, 
there were one or two. The Marines, of course, were

35:44.556 --> 35:46.939
very much in evidence. As far as the work that had to 
be done, we didn't have any problems with the

35:47.594 --> 35:54.081
Marines. We had a job to do. Really, it was not much 
of a joint effort as far as the Marines. The

36:02.269 --> 36:07.174
runaways were kind of a joint operation and some of 
the problems on the airfield. For the most part,

36:07.194 --> 36:11.278
the Air Force was the host base though. Host 
service on the base. The Marines, really I lost a

36:17.362 --> 36:21.626
lot of respect for the Marines there. I thought 
they were a well-disciplined outfit and I found

36:21.646 --> 36:30.074
out that they couldn't even get their enlisted men 
to salute over there. It was that bad. I had a Marine

36:31.876 --> 36:34.238
officer in there. We were in their club one night 
having some drinks and one of these Marine

36:34.479 --> 36:43.167
lieutenant colonels took it upon himself to get 
hacked off about something, some little thing,

36:43.400 --> 36:56.020
and he stood up and gave me the bird in the middle of 
this club, which I went over and talked to him and

36:43.400 --> 36:56.020
promptly left with the people that I had come in 
with. We got out of there, but it was a nasty scene.

36:58.243 --> 37:10.943
He called me up the next day and apologized, but I 
think somebody told him to do it, but I just, you

36:58.243 --> 37:10.943
know, I was kind of surprised at their behavior.

37:12.442 --> 37:16.749
But as far as rivalry, you're right, that goes on. 
It's kind of like neighbors, competitiveness in

37:16.769 --> 37:22.739
the office and at school and every other place. 
Each one is trying to get their piece of the pie, but

37:25.022 --> 37:36.441
it wasn't a problem over there as far as the war 
went, I thought.

37:37.028 --> 37:42.938
A lot of talk about some of the secret campaigns 
like Nixon's wars and a lot of the CIA stuff that

37:37.028 --> 37:42.938
went on. One in particular was the Air America. 
Were you aware of that? I knew about Air America and

37:47.886 --> 37:58.885
I think it's generally recognized that Air 
America is the CIA's Air Force. I thought that they

37:59.945 --> 38:03.610
were kind of glorified freight haulers really. 
They hauled all kinds of stuff all over the place

38:04.231 --> 38:22.858
and they made a lot of money and they were 
mercenaries as far as I was concerned and I

38:04.231 --> 38:22.858
respected them for what they did but I thought they 
were kind of overrated. They got a lot of press that

38:22.878 --> 38:29.327
I knew people that flew for them. When I was there 
they were, they'd drift in and out. But they were

38:38.213 --> 38:43.438
for the most part, they weren't really in the heavy 
duty stuff. I'm sure they got shot at a lot because

38:43.478 --> 38:49.825
they flew, what they flew and where they flew. But 
as far as the secret wars, I think that we did what

38:50.185 --> 38:57.573
was right for the times. President Nixon had had 
his hands full with that war and

39:00.256 --> 39:09.588
he wasn't the one that really got us into the thing 
big time. But there were, he had to fight the press

39:10.449 --> 39:19.181
and everybody else and try and get done what needed 
to be done. I don't think that there were any

39:21.029 --> 39:24.974
secrets from the people in Congress or the Senate. 
I don't think there are any secrets in Washington

39:25.054 --> 39:30.841
about military affairs. Those guys get briefed 
and they let their buddies know and they let

39:31.502 --> 39:41.435
whoever know they think is going to do their 
bidding for them.

39:43.377 --> 39:47.222
They try to keep a lot of things quiet. There again, 
it was a different time. I think it was in the best

39:50.768 --> 39:57.657
interest of the country at the time. People's 
lives were at stake and they were trying to achieve

39:58.158 --> 40:06.269
certain objectives and the secrecy was part of it. 
That probably hurt some congressional feelings,

40:06.689 --> 40:13.378
but that was part of the game. Were you aware of any 
of the CIA bases in Cambodia or Laos? I wasn't aware

40:18.609 --> 40:20.552
of any. I'm sure they have, but it wasn't hard. They 
probably wouldn't tell us about it. We had no need

40:26.260 --> 40:27.241
to know.

40:30.126 --> 40:38.117
You mentioned earlier that you respected the 
enemy troops. Yeah. What were your thoughts about

40:39.317 --> 40:41.839
the war? I had a lot of respect for the North 
Vietnamese regulars. I thought they were very

40:44.761 --> 40:48.885
well disciplined. They could get along on 
nothing. They put up with a lot of hardships and

40:51.007 --> 40:58.333
really they fought a good war against the French 
and against us. And some of the things they did, you

40:59.694 --> 41:08.442
know, the United States figured that the war was 
pretty near won in 1968. and we were being told

41:09.232 --> 41:10.934
that. The American public was being told that and 
then all of a sudden the Tet Offensive came about

41:11.795 --> 41:22.106
and it was pretty clear that we didn't have control 
of that place at all. That the North Vietnamese and

41:22.967 --> 41:32.577
the Viet Cong

41:22.967 --> 41:32.577
could do a hell of a lot of damage if they wanted to 
and they did. And really that was the turning point

41:32.637 --> 41:38.023
of the whole thing. a lot of politicians that had 
supported the war, all of a sudden decided, hey,

41:38.813 --> 41:46.021
you know, we're not going any place in this thing. 
We better get out.

41:50.026 --> 41:53.891
The VC, I didn't have as much respect for. 
Certainly they were clever and they were good

41:54.071 --> 42:03.502
fighters, but really they were kind of rabble 
gorillas as far as I was concerned.

42:06.045 --> 42:08.027
But you gotta give them credit. Between them and 
the North Vietnamese, they won the thing. Okay,

42:14.826 --> 42:25.197
concerning anti-war efforts and stuff, how did 
you feel specifically about the anti-war

42:14.826 --> 42:25.197
demonstrators and their efforts?

42:29.562 --> 42:35.128
Well, I suspected the motives of a lot of the war 
demonstrators. I thought a lot of that stuff that

42:36.104 --> 42:46.219
originated on the campuses was probably 
self-serving for a lot of people on the campuses

42:36.104 --> 42:46.219
that didn't want to go over there, didn't want to 
fight. So, they're out protesting and raising

42:46.920 --> 42:53.370
hell and running down the war effort and 
everything for probably largely personal

42:53.705 --> 42:56.269
reasons. A lot of them took off and went to Canada 
and that appalled me. I thought they should have

43:01.817 --> 43:03.479
been shot for that. But one of our presidents, I 
forgot who it was, decided that they should all be

43:04.020 --> 43:11.431
pardoned and let the bastards back in. But it makes 
me wonder what's going to happen in any future war.

43:16.419 --> 43:22.007
Does everybody decide then whether they want to go 
fight it or not? I seriously wonder if we can fight

43:23.607 --> 43:30.036
any war without some real changes in attitudes. 
But I think that the protesters had a real

43:31.238 --> 43:39.711
significant effect on the war effort. Of course 
the press was against the war anyway. Then the

43:43.877 --> 43:47.943
protests came along and they kind of played up to 
the press. The press gave them a lot of coverage and

43:52.227 --> 44:01.136
I think it helps sway a lot of people who were on the 
fence or who may have even been for the effort back

43:52.227 --> 44:01.136
the other way. We had people like Jane Fonda who 
went up to North Vietnam and consorted with the

44:02.157 --> 44:21.036
enemy while people were dying a few hundred miles 
away for what was supposed to be our national

44:02.157 --> 44:21.036
interest.

44:22.838 --> 44:24.840
I respect their right to demonstrate. I think, you 
know, that's part of our country. Certainly, the

44:27.804 --> 44:41.920
violent demonstrations, the

44:27.804 --> 44:41.920
draft dodgers and all the rest of it, I thought was 
too far. Certainly, it was too far and it was

44:42.280 --> 44:47.226
tolerated because the war wasn't popular and they 
got away with things that I think set a bad

44:47.932 --> 44:52.679
precedent. I'm not so sure that they could get away 
with it in any kind of a war that was anywhere near

44:52.840 --> 45:03.937
supported by the American people, but they did 
because nobody cared. What about the veterans

45:04.919 --> 45:12.330
that would come back and join like the Vietnam 
veterans against the war and the veterans for

45:04.919 --> 45:12.330
peace? What did you, what did you feel about it? 
Well, I feel sorry for those people. I think

45:17.692 --> 45:19.035
they're kind of pathetic. I think a lot of them were 
probably misfits in the service and they came back

45:19.797 --> 45:29.160
home and they couldn't fit in in civilian life. and 
they go off and became professional complainers

45:29.343 --> 45:36.430
and whiners and so forth. Instead of putting that 
behind them, getting on with their lives and what

45:36.510 --> 45:51.704
had to be done, supporting their families and so 
forth, why, you still see them running around in

45:36.510 --> 45:51.704
all that hippie military stuff that they wear. And 
I think they give the whole Vietnam era and the

45:57.338 --> 46:10.118
veterans a bad

45:57.338 --> 46:10.118
public image and I wish that they would go get some 
jobs and forget about it. You know, it's behind us,

46:10.158 --> 46:13.183
something in history. Did you see any, as far as 
like in the service in Vietnam, any anti-war

46:13.824 --> 46:24.882
feelings or anti-war demonstrations or I mean, 
even within the service, was there a bad feeling

46:25.148 --> 46:29.393
about it? No, you know, as far as my remembrance 
was, you know, of course there were people who

46:29.914 --> 46:50.139
weren't too thrilled about going over to Vietnam, 
but that was personal reasons and but as far as

46:29.914 --> 46:50.139
anti-war feelings and so forth, I couldn't detect 
any at all. Most of the people in the Air Force in

46:51.781 --> 46:54.885
particular You know, it was just another job. We 
had a whole string of jobs to do over the years, and

46:56.774 --> 47:00.792
that was another.
