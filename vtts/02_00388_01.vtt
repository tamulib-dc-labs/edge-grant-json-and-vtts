WEBVTT

00:03.828 --> 00:05.851
Go ahead and start talking in interviews.

00:12.120 --> 00:15.544
Has a 15 second protective device on this thing. 
Sometimes works, sometimes doesn't. Okay, would

00:19.350 --> 00:23.295
you explain then please your interest in the 
Louisiana, Missouri plant? Yes. I came to

00:27.621 --> 00:30.325
Morgantown in 1946. The station here was 
established under the Synthetic Liquid Fuels

00:31.165 --> 00:34.590
Act. We occupied space on campus at West Virginia 
University. And then Congress authorized a

00:41.721 --> 00:46.549
permanent station for Morgantown. That must have 
been about 1950, 51. My memory is fuzzy on the

00:51.957 --> 00:54.281
dates. It was formally dedicated the station on 
College Ferry Road in 1954. I came to study gas

00:59.498 --> 01:06.165
purification, purification of synthesis gas.

01:09.528 --> 01:17.357
I don't know when the Louisiana, Missouri plant 
was authorized to be constructed.

01:17.377 --> 01:18.878
It probably was the late 40s. You probably got this 
information from telling me that you didn't even

01:18.938 --> 01:23.363
know about that. But my job at the time was to review 
the German purification technology, and more

01:28.895 --> 01:37.506
specifically, to improve upon it. And our job was 
to obtain on the bench scale and on a small planet

01:39.288 --> 01:50.102
scale data that could be used in Louisiana, 
Missouri. Although they had committed

01:51.544 --> 01:57.552
themselves to the German purification process as 
such, The information that we were to supply to

01:58.882 --> 02:10.996
them was to improve the operation of the plant at 
Louisiana, Missouri.

02:12.317 --> 02:15.701
The only time I've been at Louisiana, Missouri was 
during the dedication of the plant.

02:19.265 --> 02:27.555
As I recall, their purification consisted of a 
liquid scrubber followed by a process called the

02:28.733 --> 02:42.612
soda iron process, the function of it being to 
remove the organic sulfur compounds, the liquid

02:28.733 --> 02:42.612
scrubber to remove hydrogen sulfide and carbon 
dioxide. And it may have been that between the

02:44.355 --> 02:53.948
liquid scrubber and the soda iron, they had an 
activated carbon vessel to remove gum formers,

02:54.721 --> 03:01.248
which would otherwise interfere with the 
operation of the soda iron. You must realize that,

03:01.888 --> 03:15.022
I think this is correct, that all German 
gasification processes were at atmospheric

03:01.888 --> 03:15.022
pressure, essentially, as was their gas 
purification. The Louisiana plant, the gas

03:17.024 --> 03:21.589
purification, was designed to operate under 
pressure. In fact, the first pressure

03:22.666 --> 03:30.658
gasification of coal in the world was done here in 
Morgantown back in 1946, 1947. So all of my gas

03:31.059 --> 03:40.714
purification work was under 300 pounds pressure.

03:43.478 --> 03:47.745
Since they were committed to the soda iron 
process, I didn't feel that there was any need to

03:48.434 --> 03:58.630
look at that in the laboratory, since they were 
going to operate the plant anyway and get the data

03:48.434 --> 03:58.630
out there. So, we looked at, well the Germans had 
what they call Alkazdik,

04:00.113 --> 04:11.691
that's A-L-K-A-Z-I-D. and an alkazid M. I don't 
recall the chemical composition, but one was to

04:11.924 --> 04:23.775
selectively take out the hydrogen sulfide, and 
one was to remove simultaneously hydrogen

04:11.924 --> 04:23.775
sulfide and carbon dioxide. And the need for 
taking out hydrogen sulfide selectively is that

04:24.495 --> 04:40.530
when you regenerate your liquid solution, you get 
the hydrogen sulfide and carbon dioxide off as an

04:24.495 --> 04:40.530
off-gas. And to process that in what was called the 
class process for converting hydrogen sulfide to

04:41.894 --> 04:52.563
elemental sulfur, you had to do something with the 
hydrogen sulfide. You needed a high

04:52.583 --> 04:58.208
concentration of hydrogen sulfide with respect 
to carbon dioxide. So therefore, you had to

04:58.228 --> 05:05.575
selectively absorb hydrogen sulfide rather than 
carbon dioxide. But we didn't get involved in any

05:06.135 --> 05:11.260
of the German liquid scrubbing agents. We looked 
at those available in the United States, and the

05:11.881 --> 05:27.222
ones we concentrated on were those made by Gerger 
Corporation, and they were called mono, di, and

05:11.881 --> 05:27.222
triethanolamine. The triethanolamine was the 
selective agent, so we concentrated on that,

05:27.242 --> 05:34.172
although we looked at the other two also. And the 
Louisiana recommendation, Louisiana,

05:35.073 --> 05:40.521
Missouri, was to use triethanolamine as their 
liquid scrubber. In the meantime, we were looking

05:41.632 --> 06:04.384
for better ways of removing organic sulfur rather 
than the soda iron process, because I had priced

05:41.632 --> 06:04.384
the cost of the soda iron as prepared in the United 
States, and it was an enormous figure. Of course,

06:04.404 --> 06:07.909
during the war, the Germans would not Economics 
was no problem. There was no concern. So, as I

06:13.382 --> 06:16.185
recall, they used this sort of iron. When it became 
spent, they simply threw it away. So it was way too

06:20.610 --> 06:23.975
expensive. So we looked at other methods, and

06:23.995 --> 06:37.491
we looked at activated carbon under pressure as an 
absorbent for organic sulfur compounds. Now

06:37.825 --> 06:46.233
based on the German data, their most difficult 
organic sulfur compound to remove was thiophene.

06:49.497 --> 06:58.606
So we started out on the assumption that thiophene 
would be our more difficult, most difficult thing

06:49.497 --> 06:58.606
to remove, compound to remove. So we tried 
activated carbon and it was an excellent

06:58.626 --> 07:04.812
adsorbent for thiophene. Let me interrupt for a 
moment. How would thiophene have gotten into the

07:06.491 --> 07:11.657
gas, except as a catalyst, as part of the catalyst? 
Or from the coal. From the coal itself? Yeah. I see.

07:15.442 --> 07:22.470
Most of the organic sulfur compounds in coal are of 
a thiophenic nature. Oh, I didn't know that. Yes.

07:24.853 --> 07:30.581
Most of the organic sulfur compounds are tied up as 
thiophenes.

07:30.941 --> 07:34.225
And the simplest of these thiophenes is thiophene 
per se. four carbons, four hydrogens, and a sulfur

07:34.829 --> 07:38.474
anyway. Yeah, C4H4S. So we were very elated when we 
found activated carbon responded so beautifully

07:40.676 --> 07:56.837
to thiophene and also that the activated carbon 
when it became spent could be very easily be

07:56.986 --> 08:02.352
regenerated or be vivified simply by heating it 
with a hot inert gas. And you've got back the full

08:02.832 --> 08:07.197
capacity of it for subsequent use.

08:10.741 --> 08:24.816
Concurrent with that, we thought we would look at 
methods for removing the hydrogen sulfide and

08:10.741 --> 08:24.816
organic sulfur simultaneously so that we can 
eliminate the scrubbing system, which was used

08:10.741 --> 08:24.816
for taking out hydrogen sulfide. So we had at that 
time a consultant called Dr. Huff, who had

08:25.319 --> 08:37.371
developed this catalyst, which consisted of the 
oxides of copper, chromium, and vanadium. And we

08:37.391 --> 08:39.292
studied that.

08:42.676 --> 08:44.498
It absorbed the hydrogen sulfide 100%. There was 
nothing in the F1 gas. It reduced the organic

08:48.642 --> 08:54.347
sulfur,

08:48.642 --> 08:54.347
the usual forms, carbon oxisulfide, carbon 
disulfide. They were captains. But the thiophene

09:01.071 --> 09:04.034
was too refractory. It didn't touch the thiophene 
at all. But it did work beautifully. And then when

09:08.919 --> 09:17.488
it started passing sulfur, then we simply 
regenerated it with air and got it back to the

09:08.919 --> 09:17.488
oxides. Then when it was put back on stream, these 
oxides just by the nature of them, were reduced by

09:22.677 --> 09:28.503
the synthesis gas to the element. And I think at the 
time,

09:29.824 --> 09:46.041
we utilized 10% of the synthesis gas for the 
reduction step, just the way it worked. Well, this

09:46.061 --> 09:48.904
became uneconomical then, so we dropped that. In 
fact, we dropped the idea of removing hydrogen

09:49.880 --> 09:55.668
sulfide and ordinary sulfur simultaneously. 
About that time, the gasifier on campus at

09:55.688 --> 10:14.773
Beachhurst Avenue was put into operation, and as 
whereas we were operating under slagging

09:55.688 --> 10:14.773
conditions, and whereas the German processes 
were non-slagging, And therefore, in order to

10:15.631 --> 10:19.414
operate under slagging conditions, it required a 
much higher temperature. I think the island gas

10:19.434 --> 10:24.238
was something like 2,400 degrees Fahrenheit. So 
when we went to analyze the gas to find out what

10:25.179 --> 10:34.667
organic sulfur compounds were there, 
unfortunately, now, there was no thiophene. The

10:36.229 --> 10:44.035
temperatures obviously cracked it down to 
hydrogen sulfide and methane, perhaps. I don't

10:44.075 --> 10:44.676
know. And the only organic sulfur compound 
present in the gas was that as carbonyl sulfide,

10:45.550 --> 10:52.017
COS. This was of some concern because whereas 
thiophene is a liquid at ambient temperatures,

10:53.799 --> 11:01.808
COS is a gas. So we were concerned that the 
activated carbon could effectively take out a

11:02.669 --> 11:10.217
gaseous organic sulfur compound. So we 
concentrated our efforts on that and found that it

11:10.237 --> 11:14.342
didn't work very nicely. I think I recall a rough 
cost estimate of something like the activated

11:14.913 --> 11:27.050
carbon cycle was something like two-tenths of a 
cent per thousand cubic feet. It was extremely

11:27.070 --> 11:29.013
cheap. We investigated a wide variety of 
charcoals, those made from coconut shale, which

11:30.335 --> 11:40.730
back then was selling for something like $1.25 a 
pound, I think. And then we also looked at some That

11:45.878 --> 11:58.199
one that was prepared from coal,

11:45.878 --> 11:58.199
supplied by somebody on Nimble Island in 
Pittsburgh, Columbia Carbon Company, I believe.

11:58.219 --> 12:07.515
But anyway, it was relatively inexpensive, quite 
inexpensive compared to the coconut shell, and it

11:58.219 --> 12:07.515
worked almost as well, so we concentrated on that. 
And have these processes been adopted by IGT,

12:08.052 --> 12:16.323
let's say, in manufacturing high gas in Chicago? 
Comper's company used the activated carbon for

12:17.344 --> 12:27.879
absorbing, adsorbing organic sulfur. I can't 
tell you where the plant was. But

12:30.823 --> 12:37.131
the synthane plant At Brewston, the coal 
gasification plant uses activated carbon for

12:37.752 --> 12:47.164
taking out organic sulfur compounds. At 
Louisiana and Missouri, I think this is correct,

12:47.865 --> 12:56.776
they operated the soda iron.

12:57.497 --> 13:01.462
They developed a hot spot, and I think the vessel 
ruptured. Did McGee or Kattel mention this? They

13:03.184 --> 13:04.605
said the vessel ruptured. Yeah, and I don't think 
it was put back into operation. because by that

13:08.195 --> 13:13.381
time we had found that activated carbon could do 
what soda iron could do. So our recommendation was

13:14.242 --> 13:23.371
simply a liquid scrubber, triethanolamine, and 
of course the liquid scrubber, you cannot operate

13:14.242 --> 13:23.371
it to remove all the hydrogen sulfide. It becomes 
uneconomical. In fact, I don't think you could

13:26.034 --> 13:30.659
reduce the vapor pressure sufficient that you 
could take it all out anyway. And we did various

13:34.469 --> 13:54.013
efficiency studies to determine the optimum 
hydrogen sulfide to be left in the gas leaving the

13:34.469 --> 13:54.013
liquid scrubber and this came out to be about 25 
grains per 100 cubic feet so this we removed by the

13:34.469 --> 13:54.013
inexpensive classical method the old iron oxide 
box it's simply iron oxide on wood shavings and it

13:54.415 --> 14:18.297
cleans it right up beautifully so we recommended 
the liquid scrubber followed by iron oxide

13:54.415 --> 14:18.297
followed by activated carbon and this gets your 
total sulfur down

13:54.415 --> 14:18.297
probably certainly less than a tenth of a grain per 
hundred cubic feet. And of course we were

14:23.834 --> 14:40.842
interested in

14:23.834 --> 14:40.842
sulfur even lower than that because at the time we 
had a cooperative agreement with, I think it was

14:23.834 --> 14:40.842
Southern Natural Gas, to study the effective 
sulfur on the activity of a nickel catalyst for

14:41.311 --> 14:49.907
converting hydrogen and carbon monoxide to 
methane. So we purified the gas over a wide range of

14:49.927 --> 14:57.160
sulfur concentrations. established the life of 
the catalyst with respect to the emits sulfur

14:57.427 --> 15:01.992
concentration. So we were interested in getting 
down as far as we could. I think the specifications

15:04.735 --> 15:13.945
for Fischer-Tropsch at the time was something 
like a tenth of a grain per 100 cubic feet of total

15:04.735 --> 15:13.945
sulfur, and that's what we were shooting at. Of 
course, we preferred lower because nickel

15:14.466 --> 15:24.497
catalyst is much more prone to be poisoned by 
sulfur than the Fischer-Tropsch catalyst,

15:14.466 --> 15:24.497
either the iron or the cobalt. So that's

15:24.477 --> 15:33.366
about the extent. As I say, the unfortunate thing 
is that I don't think there are any data on the

15:35.648 --> 15:51.463
purification at Louisiana, Missouri, with the 
exception of one paper. by a man by the name of

15:52.473 --> 16:02.046
Wilmot, and I think this was limited to the liquid 
scrubber. And he's located now in Venice,

16:03.007 --> 16:05.911
Florida, if I'm correct? He left here and went to 
Australia, to retire in Australia, and then he

16:05.931 --> 16:13.281
came back, and I don't know where he is. But as far as 
I, to my knowledge, that's the only

16:21.245 --> 16:27.812
piece of literature on the Louisiana gas 
purification system. Which, as I told you at the

16:27.832 --> 16:32.056
front, is unfortunate, but that's just the way it 
is. I get the impression that the view of the German

16:32.076 --> 16:38.263
documents gave you a substantial edge. The 
thiophene, for instance, you knew immediately

16:39.664 --> 16:44.509
where the problem was going to lie. Which didn't 
materialize, of course.

16:49.493 --> 17:00.645
Would you say that the German documents were of any 
substantial

16:49.493 --> 17:00.645
help? Not as far as gas purification is concerned, 
since we didn't adopt any of it. And again, since we

17:09.314 --> 17:15.501
were operating under pressure, and all there was 
was an atmospheric pressure, it didn't apply. And

17:16.173 --> 17:21.462
of course, the liquid scrubbing agents that they 
used, we were not interested in because they

17:16.173 --> 17:21.462
weren't manufactured in this country. And from 
the data I saw, they were in no way superior to the

17:22.483 --> 17:32.379
ethanol amines.

17:36.085 --> 17:40.973
So I can't really say no that they were of that much 
help. In fact, they were too expensive.

17:47.003 --> 18:01.023
They were helpful in this respect as far as 
establishing specifications for the purified

17:47.003 --> 18:01.023
gas with respect to the Fischer-Trump synthesis. 
They were in that respect helpful. But as far as the

18:04.207 --> 18:09.214
technology is concerned, I can't say it was much 
help.

18:12.687 --> 18:14.649
How long were you working on purification gas? 
Two, three years? From 1946 to 1955. 1946 to 55. So

18:20.416 --> 18:23.420
you really worked through the closure of the 
Louisiana, Missouri plant? Yes. Did there seem to

18:26.023 --> 18:34.833
be...

18:26.023 --> 18:34.833
Did the personnel of your own mind seem to be 
agitated that the Louisiana, Missouri plant

18:26.023 --> 18:34.833
closed? I can't speak for others, but I certainly 
was. I mean, I had devoted...

18:43.096 --> 18:49.443
Up until that time, five years of research to be 
utilized in Louisiana, Missouri, I never was. So

18:50.304 --> 18:51.846
it was a discomfort to me. And,

18:53.007 --> 18:57.772
well, it's just unfortunate. But at the time, 
well, when this station was, when we occupied

18:58.233 --> 19:13.069
space on campus, there were two stations in the 
Pittsburgh area. one on Forbes Street in the

19:13.876 --> 19:20.244
Oakland area of Pittsburgh, and one at Brewston, 
Pennsylvania. And when we tried to get a permanent

19:20.264 --> 19:43.613
station established in Morgantown, there was a 
lot of hassle among the two stations, between the

19:20.264 --> 19:43.613
two stations in Pittsburgh, feeling it was 
unnecessary for a third center to be established

19:20.264 --> 19:43.613
within a distance of 75 miles.

19:44.943 --> 19:56.253
But we were established primarily as a coal 
gasification center, whereas Brewston was

19:44.943 --> 19:56.253
primarily coal hydrogenation. And it remains 
that way pretty much today, that way. But anyway,

20:00.237 --> 20:03.280
we did get the station here in Morgantown. And I 
recall that when the Louisiana, Missouri plant

20:03.300 --> 20:12.148
was brought up, It was strongly opposed by Dr. 
Storch, who was the head of the Brewston station at

20:13.124 --> 20:18.853
the time. Dr. Storch was a real scientist and more 
or less like fundamental research in addition to

20:19.354 --> 20:28.769
the small pilot scale work that we're doing in 
Brewston. And I think it was his opinion that we

20:29.590 --> 20:37.663
were going to too large of a scale.

20:39.027 --> 20:55.665
Then in 1952, I'm sure this is a coincidence, but in 
1952, with the change of the administration,

20:39.027 --> 20:55.665
there was a massive change in the personnel in the 
Washington office, and this Dr. Storch then

20:39.027 --> 20:55.665
became the head in Washington. But I say I think 
it's a mere coincidence that Louisiana was closed

20:55.685 --> 21:05.355
at the time that he went to Washington. But as I say, 
he did oppose the construction of the plant, but no

21:06.179 --> 21:18.359
one man, after it had gone along that long of a 
period of time, could be influential in closing it

21:06.179 --> 21:18.359
down. I just think it happened to be a coincidence. 
Why do you think it closed down? Well, as I was

21:22.866 --> 21:25.931
telling Dr. Kramer on the phone, I really don't 
know. No one talked about it.

21:31.280 --> 21:32.963
I think that... Based on cost estimates, which I'm 
not familiar with, you're more familiar with this

21:33.972 --> 21:44.848
than I am, I think it was becoming more or less 
competitive with crude petroleum. And

21:45.810 --> 21:53.321
whether the oil lobby had anything to do with it, I 
just don't know. But I have my feelings. As I was

21:56.566 --> 22:02.595
telling Dr. Kramer on the phone, at that time, the 
petroleum industry wouldn't even look at the coal

21:56.566 --> 22:02.595
industry. They were absolutely enemies, so to 
speak, completely divorced of each other. And

22:10.053 --> 22:22.853
then, as you know how things have turned out, I 
don't know how much of the coal now is controlled by

22:10.053 --> 22:22.853
those trolleys and such.

22:22.873 --> 22:30.304
But it's unfortunate that it happened that way, 
but as I told also Dr. Kramer, I don't think we'd be

22:22.873 --> 22:30.304
in the situation we are today if that plant had been 
allowed to continue to operate. What did you do

22:35.508 --> 22:40.336
after you stopped experimenting with gas? At that 
time,

22:42.219 --> 22:57.203
they had developed at the Denver, Colorado 
station, I believe it was, one of the Colorado

22:42.219 --> 22:57.203
stations, a process that they call low 
temperature carbonization of coal.

23:02.110 --> 23:12.159
As opposed to coke oven operation that operates 
something like 2,000 degrees Fahrenheit, low

23:02.110 --> 23:12.159
temperature carbonization operates about 950 
degrees Fahrenheit. Therefore, the tars that

23:12.539 --> 23:22.789
evolve from the coal, whereas they are cracked in 
the coke oven to make gas, they come out as a tar

23:12.539 --> 23:22.789
liquid in the low temperature carbonization. So 
they put up a plant, Alcoa, in conjunction with the

23:23.590 --> 23:31.797
Texas Power Light Company, put up a low 
temperature carbonization plant in Texas.

23:32.131 --> 23:36.668
Rockdale, Texas, I believe.

23:36.688 --> 23:40.963
And I suppose it's hindsight. They didn't know 
what to do with the tar.

23:45.901 --> 23:47.583
You couldn't burn it for its fuel value. 
Otherwise, that wouldn't be enough to defray the

23:47.643 --> 23:52.028
cost of the expense of carbonizing coal. And the 
purpose of carbonizing the coal was to get a char

23:52.668 --> 23:57.834
that you could generate power with in a 
conventional boiler. So you had to have a profit on

23:58.474 --> 24:03.760
this tar, at least to defray the expenses of 
converting the coal into the char. So we looked at

24:05.202 --> 24:08.425
it as a source of chemicals. And we worked on that 
for approximately 10 years. The upshot of that was

24:16.124 --> 24:41.355
that at the time there was a big hassle about 
biodegradable detergents and we knew that

24:16.124 --> 24:41.355
biodegradable detergents could be made by 
reacting benzene with a long chain olefin with the

24:16.124 --> 24:41.355
double bond on the last carbon. Fortunately, this 
material from Texas, the tar we were working with

24:42.314 --> 24:53.467
was from malignite coal, and it had about 12% of 
this type of olefin. So we extracted these and made

24:53.487 --> 24:56.590
biodegradable detergents. That was one of our 
products. And then we made carbon black, carbon

24:59.193 --> 25:11.747
electrodes,

24:59.193 --> 25:11.747
phthalic and malic anhydrides. But anyway, when 
we found out the yields of all these things, as I

25:12.773 --> 25:30.569
recall, we figured out that a 2 million ton a year 
carbonization plant, the market would be

25:12.773 --> 25:30.569
completely flooded with these chemicals. 
Completely flooded. So after we found out that, we

25:32.992 --> 25:37.696
discontinued that. And then we... Why would that 
be a disadvantage? No. Flood the market. You

25:44.786 --> 25:47.209
didn't have the consumer. Oh, I see. One small 
plant like that, and you produce enough

25:49.111 --> 25:55.678
biodegradable detergents to the country. So all 
interest was lost in that, whether it'll be, oh, we

25:57.721 --> 26:08.413
know that it is a source of jet fuels to try to get a 
premium value product out of it. Probably, if it

26:09.693 --> 26:13.841
ever comes back into being again, it'll be a source 
of liquid fuels. In fact, we did some work on that.

26:17.928 --> 26:22.677
And it converts very nicely to a synthetic 
petroleum. So if it ever, if it ever revived, it'll

26:22.697 --> 26:29.490
probably be the end product that you can use for it. 
Then we made a complete flip-flop after getting

26:30.297 --> 26:34.584
all this organic chemistry. We completely got 
involved in inorganic chemistry by looking at the

26:34.644 --> 26:48.407
minerals of coal, the mineralogy of coal, and 
specifically the effect that they have on the

26:34.644 --> 26:48.407
various conversion products, processes. 
Unfortunately, we didn't get to complete that to

26:48.387 --> 26:54.736
my satisfaction. I wanted to find out what effect 
these minerals in a variety of coals with

26:54.756 --> 27:07.514
different mineral constituents, what effect 
this would have on the rate of gasification, what

26:54.756 --> 27:07.514
effect it would have on our service of catalyst and 
coal hydrogenation. This work, I think, is

27:07.994 --> 27:12.801
currently being done at Penn State now under Dr. 
Gidham. And I think it's a very fruitful area of

27:13.943 --> 27:17.888
research.

27:20.213 --> 27:39.100
I feel that in the future, when a person buys coal, 
that the specifications that now exist, such as

27:20.213 --> 27:39.100
the BTU value, the ash content, the sulfur 
content, will actually, there will be limits on

27:20.213 --> 27:39.100
certain mineral constituents. so much cadmium, 
so much mercury, because these do volatilize

27:40.852 --> 27:47.139
after the atmosphere. So I think that the 
mineralogy of coal will get involved in the future

27:47.159 --> 27:53.106
specifications of coal. And indeed, some coals 
that we looked at, one particular one had more tin

27:53.127 --> 28:05.301
in it than some of the tin ores that they're 
processing to make tin. And one had more copper in

28:05.321 --> 28:10.487
it than some of the copper ores that they're 
processing. So anyway, based on that mineralogy

28:11.176 --> 28:21.891
work we did,

28:11.176 --> 28:21.891
sort of serendipity I guess, we got a contract with 
NASA to look at the lunar samples. So we had lunar

28:22.712 --> 28:28.981
rocks from Apollo 11, 12, 14, and 15. So of course we 
got a lot of publicity out of that. And then when

28:33.940 --> 28:35.883
that was completed... I just have a curiosity. 
What is lunar rock like? I'll never in my life meet

28:39.628 --> 28:43.473
somebody else who would send a piece of slag.

28:48.139 --> 28:51.103
Lava. In fact, the composition is very close to 
volcanic lava. But... We put it on display out here

28:57.937 --> 29:08.393
at the station for the public, and we never saw 
their faces drop so much when they saw it. And then

29:08.413 --> 29:16.645
we had some under the microscope, and there you 
could really see the various minerals and the

29:08.413 --> 29:16.645
various colors and the purples and the pinks and 
the reds and what have you. So that sort of helped it

29:16.665 --> 29:21.312
along as far as the public was concerned. Was there 
anything unusual about that lava, that slab? It's

29:26.810 --> 29:29.614
the same kind of thing that you could find anywhere 
else.

29:32.159 --> 29:35.403
No carbon, no metal. Just a mixture of calcium, 
magnesium, silicon oxides, iron. There was a

29:40.148 --> 29:49.978
higher percentage of titanium than we find here on 
Earth, but not that much different. Not that much

29:50.479 --> 29:50.960
different. I'll never meet anyone again in my life 
who examined more rocks, I'm sure. Well, you

29:55.585 --> 30:00.049
should, from Texas, go over to Houston.

30:00.690 --> 30:01.491
And then we...

30:05.150 --> 30:11.078
got involved in some co-hybridization work on a 
very nominal scale.

30:16.425 --> 30:17.246
And then where did you go? Right here. Right, okay. 
That ticket was then retirement. Right. Okay.

30:22.633 --> 30:24.836
Have any more questions you'd like to ask Dr. 
Cranford? I'd like to inquire, you mentioned to me

30:24.856 --> 30:30.644
you had a short exchange with Secretary Warren. 
Yes. On the closing of the plant. Yes. He, uh, he was

30:34.360 --> 30:45.015
in Morgantown, visiting the station, shortly 
after we moved to the interior, I think, and we had

30:34.360 --> 30:45.015
lunch at a restaurant in town. And, uh, I don't know 
how the subject was brought up, but I mentioned

30:46.076 --> 30:55.249
that Louisiana was very planned, and that, uh, I 
thought it was a pity that it was shut down. And

30:56.170 --> 31:01.397
that's when he made the remark that, do you think 
the government starts research programs and

30:56.170 --> 31:01.397
then, uh, doesn't get sufficient information 
from them. And I said, well, on this particular

31:05.520 --> 31:08.866
case, that was the case.

31:14.557 --> 31:25.917
But the thing that also disturbs me is that we're 
putting up more and more of these plants. In all my

31:27.803 --> 31:34.793
reading of the literature, I don't see anybody 
referring or using any references to the

31:27.803 --> 31:34.793
Louisiana, Missouri plan.
