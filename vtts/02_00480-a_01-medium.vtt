00:01.465 --> 00:03.928
1982, this is Terry Anderson. We are interviewing 
General Kennedy. You were born May 16, 1904, in

00:06.691 --> 00:11.376
Leggett, Texas. Let's start out by talking a 
little bit about your background. Could you tell

00:14.480 --> 00:16.803
me about your parents?

00:19.566 --> 00:23.030
Both my parents were born in Texas. Only one of my 
grandparents came in about the time of the Civil

00:23.070 --> 00:31.219
War, just after the Civil War. I grew up between 
Polk County, Texas and Jefferson County, Texas.

00:40.702 --> 00:46.170
Polk County at that time was the big thicket, in 
other words, the country background. I went away

00:46.190 --> 00:58.228
to sea when I was 16 and went to Europe and up east and 
to South America and Mexico. No kidding, why? Oh, I

01:00.393 --> 01:02.756
thought it would be an adventure. Did your family 
have the money to send you off to? No, I worked on

01:06.741 --> 01:08.603
trapped ships. Oh, you did? Yeah, and came back and 
finished high school and then went on to M.M. from

01:15.711 --> 01:16.212
there. And so, now why did you decide to leave when 
you were 16 years old? Most people don't leave home

01:22.900 --> 01:24.882
at that age. Frankly, I don't think this is too 
pertinent to what you have in mind, but since you

01:25.992 --> 01:31.641
asked the question, I'll answer it. Owing to an 
illness in my family in Beaumont, I spent a year in

01:33.023 --> 01:52.253
high school in Galveston living with my aunt and 
working in the afternoons, but spending my spare

01:33.023 --> 01:52.253
time between the gymnasium and the library in 
YMCA. I read Jack London's books and got the idea of

01:52.756 --> 01:57.282
adventure. Now, mind you, there's a lesson for 
youngsters in this. It doesn't belong in your

02:02.069 --> 02:03.211
tape. It sure does. We want to know about it. I 
worked by, which means in the harbor, on the ship,

02:06.455 --> 02:12.804
Messboy, until we sailed. And we took on the crew, a 
good deal of it, just before sailing. Well, the

02:18.011 --> 02:22.678
night that we were first at sea, a man tried to kill 
me. I mean, serious matter. He chased me with a fire

02:25.269 --> 02:34.041
axe, and as it happened, a man saw him and just cold 
cocked him as we turned the corner. And they put the

02:35.303 --> 02:37.406
man in irons, of course. It turns out he was a drug 
addict. And they kept him in the pokey until we got

02:39.909 --> 02:43.595
to Norfolk. But as I lay in my bunk that night, I said 
to myself, This is adventure, and I don't like it.

02:55.688 --> 02:57.430
It was a little bit too much adventure. Yes, 
exactly. And that is how I happen now. What did your

03:03.220 --> 03:05.984
parents think of you leaving home at sixteen? My 
father actually came down to the ship to see me off.

03:14.347 --> 03:24.138
talked to a large brother of his that he'd turned up 
on the ship about me, but my parents didn't tell me

03:14.347 --> 03:24.138
what not to do. If I did something which was 
patently wrong, they made it clear to me and

03:24.178 --> 03:39.516
punished me for it, but they didn't, see, for 
example, my wife thought for a long time that I ran

03:24.178 --> 03:39.516
away to sea. I didn't run away to sea at all. I just 
went, that's all. I wasn't running away from

03:43.777 --> 03:45.540
anything. As it happened, you see, on that first 
ship, I expected to come back and go back to high

03:47.342 --> 03:55.634
school in the fall. But it turned out we broke down, 
and that was another unpleasant adventure.

04:02.404 --> 04:12.298
Nevertheless, when I got back into the East Coast, 
it was too late to go back to school, so I just caught

04:02.404 --> 04:12.298
another ship and went to South America. upshot of 
all this, I came back and finished high school. But

04:17.628 --> 04:35.610
as you might suspect, that left me in a relatively 
peculiar position with my peers because back

04:17.628 --> 04:35.610
then, people from East Texas, hell, some of them 
never left the county. Let's go elsewhere. And I

04:37.712 --> 04:41.577
had some experiences which were different. 
Anyway, I don't know that that makes any, I don't

04:42.367 --> 04:48.418
think it has any bearing on what we're talking 
about. I want to know about the background of each

04:49.279 --> 04:57.394
former student who became a general, and that's 
why I'm asking you these questions. All right,

04:57.414 --> 04:58.636
then I'll proceed. I worked my way through A&M. 
Before we get to A&M, I'd like to know a little bit

05:02.583 --> 05:06.028
about this cruise. Now when you went to South 
America and when you went to Europe, what did you

05:06.048 --> 05:11.296
learn? What kind of impact did that have on you? Oh, 
I think it's obvious enough. You learn that people

05:18.846 --> 05:21.490
are different. You learn that just because people 
live a certain way and think a certain way down in

05:23.493 --> 05:30.463
Polk County,

05:33.869 --> 05:36.272
You know that from your own travels. And a certain, 
I should say, a certain,

05:37.754 --> 05:45.803
call it cynicism? I don't know what you'd call it. 
You've seen

05:50.028 --> 05:54.814
men get killed. Yeah. And that makes a difference. 
You know the reasons for it and that sort of thing.

06:02.203 --> 06:02.323
Mm-hm. Can you tell me a little bit about your 
mother and your father? My mother died when I was

06:08.714 --> 06:15.942
young and I just barely in the vaguest way remember 
her. She was the daughter of a physician who, like

06:17.604 --> 06:33.222
my other grandfather, was embittered by the Civil 
War and came back, came from where he was down to

06:33.792 --> 06:36.975
Texas and finished up in that small town. It isn't 
even there anymore. Anyway, she died and that was

06:40.298 --> 06:53.469
partially the reason why I spent my summers with my 
grandmother, her mother, who lived up there, far

06:40.298 --> 06:53.469
back in the country. My stepmother was a 
wonderfully good woman and couldn't have been a

06:54.510 --> 07:00.895
better mother to me. My father at the time I suppose 
we were talking about,

07:03.509 --> 07:25.831
was he sold oil well supplies and helped set up a 
business in Beaumont, Texas that, oh hell, in

07:03.509 --> 07:25.831
recent years they just sold out of interest in it 
that he'd aired to us. But his background was this,

07:26.712 --> 07:30.175
his father was a Presbyterian minister, 
embittered by the Civil War, and came in, old

07:31.505 --> 07:39.135
Indianola, which was later washed away.

07:42.259 --> 07:50.790
But my mother, I mean my grandmother, who had come 
down in a wagon train from Virginia just before the

07:42.259 --> 07:50.790
Civil War, and all the men went back, you see. 
Anyway, they married, and my father was born in

07:52.272 --> 07:58.660
Cthulhu. when it was nothing, not much, still 
isn't. Now, this might bear on it, I don't know, but

08:04.736 --> 08:23.400
my grandfather and grandmother were absolutely 
intent that he should get an education and were

08:04.736 --> 08:23.400
reasonably sure he couldn't get it in Texas. So 
they sent him to a prep school in Tennessee, an old

08:24.562 --> 08:29.608
prep school, And then on to University of 
Virginia, where he was kicked out for

08:30.618 --> 08:38.950
ungentlemanly conduct. A man called him a damn 
Texas Longhorn. He knocked him off the upstairs

08:41.854 --> 08:44.898
porch for that. And then he found out that my 
grandparents had been literally starving

08:44.918 --> 08:55.813
themselves to ensure his education. By that time, 
my grandfather was the chaplain. of the prison at

09:00.841 --> 09:02.703
Huntsville. My father finished his degree at 
Huntsville. The college is still there as a matter

09:07.888 --> 09:09.770
of fact. And then he taught school down in that big 
thicket place where he met my mother and went

09:11.071 --> 09:22.683
through some permutations and ended up as a 
businessman and had a pretty good one. I say a

09:23.804 --> 09:26.887
pretty good one, he was a real good one. He loved 
people and was a natural extrovert and a good

09:29.866 --> 09:33.430
athlete. Things that I know was. But he, I think, 
enjoyed his life. Now, what led into that was

09:41.659 --> 09:47.546
you're asking me whether they had objected in any 
way. It never occurred to me that they would

09:48.107 --> 09:50.029
object. It was generally conceded this was my 
business. And I think that's right.

10:00.258 --> 10:06.166
So your father then wasn't the domineering type 
father or the authoritarian type? No, he was very,

10:06.186 --> 10:07.668
very explicit. When there was something I 
couldn't do, by God, I knew it. The only athletic

10:13.115 --> 10:19.683
activity I ever engaged in was boxing. And I did 
that because, hell, I had a set of boxing gloves

10:19.703 --> 10:26.632
from the time I could walk, I guess. In any case, 
after I came back, from the sea. I boxed at the YMCA

10:33.844 --> 10:40.994
there in Beaumont, and at that time Beaumont was a 
hell-bent sports town. And a fellow classmate of

10:42.376 --> 10:49.406
mine, they had some pretty good boxers, and I 
worked out with them too. And I got it in my head that

10:50.648 --> 10:55.976
I would be a, you know, a preliminary. You get ten 
bucks, man, that's a hell of a lot of money. But he

10:59.877 --> 11:02.600
said, you absolutely won't do that. And that was 
it. In retrospect, he knew exactly what he was

11:06.185 --> 11:09.989
talking about. I didn't. But it was no question in 
my mind. Since he said I couldn't do it, I couldn't

11:14.275 --> 11:16.477
do it. That was the way he was. But those things 
which were my decisions, he let me make them and let

11:18.941 --> 11:27.471
them die by them, too. Did he want you to further 
your education? He was very interested in it. But

11:34.353 --> 11:46.810
you see, he kept in the background some of what he 
and my grandmother, the one, his mother, thought

11:34.353 --> 11:46.810
about me, and thought about, for example, this 
business of mine going to sea. I didn't even know

11:46.990 --> 11:55.001
until my father died, and I was clearing up his 
affairs, and he had saved the letters that they had

11:46.990 --> 11:55.001
exchanged. It was in the night. And I'd sat there 
quiet because I didn't know that they felt as

11:57.910 --> 12:02.817
deeply about this as they did. Well, that's good. 
They looked at it as my decision, but they

12:06.241 --> 12:12.770
absolutely deplored it, of course. But I didn't 
know that. Yeah. But I don't think this is

12:15.454 --> 12:17.757
important. Now, let's talk about your education. 
Oh, well. I want to talk, before we get to Texas A&M,

12:20.240 --> 12:27.630
can you tell me a little bit about your education in 
high school about that time? Well,

12:28.252 --> 12:37.882
gosh, let's see if I can think of anything very 
consequential. Well, where'd you go to high

12:37.902 --> 12:39.204
school? I finished high school in Vermont. Okay, 
okay. What were your favorite topics? What kind of

12:47.072 --> 12:48.413
classes did you like?

12:53.879 --> 12:57.583
Well, I suppose I'll have a confession to make on 
that. I looked on high school

12:57.884 --> 13:04.833
as something that you got through. And I carried 
this over to A&M to a degree. What the object is,

13:09.860 --> 13:17.751
find out what the teacher wants and give it to them. 
That's the way you make good grades. That's what

13:20.374 --> 13:21.716
the thing's all about. Education is something you 
do yourself. The teacher is a person who, if you're

13:27.415 --> 13:31.220
lucky, will help you do it. But that's neither here 
nor there. The object in the teacher-scholar

13:33.223 --> 13:42.455
relationship for me in high school was find out 
what they want and let them have it. In other words,

13:44.278 --> 13:52.849
those interests that I had were not too much 
related to school. So in other words, you didn't

13:54.567 --> 13:58.673
really care much for school. No, the system at A&M 
was so much more disciplined, so much more

13:58.693 --> 14:04.841
demanding, you couldn't get away with that. Oh, I 
see. I made good grades because I still played that

14:06.483 --> 14:11.790
tune, but you had to do the work. In high school, if 
that was true, I didn't know it, I didn't feel it.

14:19.221 --> 14:22.465
Oh, hell, I don't think there's anything that... 
If there is, I can't remember. Oh, shoot.

14:29.903 --> 14:31.345
No, I can't think of anything. Okay, let's then 
talk about your favorite. Let's talk about going

14:37.334 --> 14:38.836
to A&M. Why did you decide on A&M? Frankly, because 
of the money. And also because when I finished high

14:45.907 --> 14:53.177
school, I wrote to MIT and Caltech. I knew I wanted 
to be an engineer. Because I figured out, look,

14:55.890 --> 15:02.978
I had dug ditches for a living. And by that time, and 
I knew damn well there was a better way to make a

15:03.358 --> 15:08.704
living. So MIT came back and said they didn't 
really think that I probably could qualify.

15:18.235 --> 15:19.697
California didn't even answer. And by that time, I 
knew what the what the financial aspects of this

15:22.672 --> 15:25.875
were, and that's why I went there now. I knew it was a 
good engineering school, and I'm sure it still is.

15:34.543 --> 15:37.165
So you had made up your mind that you wanted to be an 
engineer? Oh yes, yes. Look, for example, let me,

15:39.668 --> 15:50.097
this is Picayune, I think, but in the process of 
working in the engine room of ships, I found out

15:50.870 --> 15:56.156
what you had to do to qualify to be an engineer on a 
ship. But if you came out of an engineering school

15:57.217 --> 15:59.780
with B.S. in engineering, Jesus Christ, you could 
work three months, pass the test, and be one. But it

16:05.406 --> 16:12.554
took you years and years of working in the engine 
room before you could even take the examination.

16:14.156 --> 16:19.442
That's why it made sense to me to go get an 
engineering degree

16:22.088 --> 16:25.314
But you see, I worked on construction jobs. That's 
the way I made my expenses at A&M. I was lucky. I made

16:32.047 --> 16:35.113
enough in the summers to pay my way. Not with any 
leftover, I might add. I worked at A&M. What type of

16:41.022 --> 16:43.645
jobs did you do at A&M, the construction work? 
Well, no, there wasn't any. No, what you'd call

16:46.107 --> 16:53.295
fallout for work, and it was two bits an hour, it 
didn't make a difference what you did. The first

16:53.355 --> 17:01.183
few years I worked mostly cutting grass, trimming 
grass, whatever. And then somebody found out that

17:01.944 --> 17:08.110
I knew how to weld, so I signed on at the shops in ag 
engineering. I didn't do much work, to tell you the

17:08.782 --> 17:16.450
truth, because there wasn't much work to do, but it 
was still 25 cents an hour. It didn't make any

17:16.590 --> 17:17.832
difference what you did. But this was for pocket 
money. I made enough, fortunately, in the summers

17:23.298 --> 17:27.662
to carry my other expenses. Did your father help 
pay for tuition? No, he didn't. Not that I didn't

17:33.183 --> 17:36.247
ask him to. I think he probably would have if I'd 
asked him to, but I didn't want to ask him to. My last

17:46.319 --> 17:58.414
year, since I had many other things to do other than 
just what I had been doing, I borrowed a couple

17:46.319 --> 17:58.414
hundred dollars from my aunt. Maidenhead, the one 
that my father's sister, who I'd gone to school

17:58.850 --> 18:04.976
with, lived with in Galveston. We were close. But 
prior to that time, I'd made enough to cover.

18:13.203 --> 18:28.637
I don't think any of this is too germane, but if you 
wanted to— What about—can you tell me about your

18:13.203 --> 18:28.637
core outfit?

18:29.393 --> 18:30.635
went through an artillery. Now this I think is 
pertinent, and this I think can possibly make a

18:32.317 --> 18:36.522
contribution.

18:39.045 --> 18:54.986
The ROTC system that I went through with was 
extremely beneficial to my experience in the

18:39.045 --> 18:54.986
military, very much so. I want to distinguish 
between the OTC living system and the MS&T, what

18:57.102 --> 19:09.778
you were taught

18:57.102 --> 19:09.778
in the lectures in the department, they were 
valueless. Quite without value. The military

19:12.101 --> 19:13.483
science, you mean? Military science and tactics 
was quite without value. I'm not under any

19:17.988 --> 19:19.771
illusion about that. It had no educational 
content. It was something you did because you had

19:22.875 --> 19:24.797
to. And something the tactical officers did 
because they had to. But the ROT system that I lived

19:30.173 --> 19:34.559
in was something else. This taught, for example, 
first thing you have to do is learn how to do as

19:36.341 --> 19:46.816
you're told, to take orders. Sure. Then as you 
gradually acquire authority, you also acquire

19:50.798 --> 19:55.986
the responsibility that goes with it. Now, this is 
a must in all forms of the military, obviously, but

19:57.147 --> 20:09.625
frequently it takes a long, long time for man to 
learn that. The ROTC system that I went through

20:10.727 --> 20:18.358
compressed that and taught it to you in four years. 
It also taught you that the essence of a military

20:19.722 --> 20:39.290
operation, I don't care what it is, infantry, 
cavalry, air force, is to get a group of men to do a

20:19.722 --> 20:39.290
thing, to attain a common goal. But, and this is 
very important, it taught you that that group of

20:40.311 --> 20:49.324
men was made up of individuals, each of whom was 
different. There are no such thing as clones in

20:51.766 --> 21:00.798
human beings except the twin. There are not many of 
those. This is what the ROTC system that I went

21:04.763 --> 21:11.072
through taught me. Now, this was not a common of all 
ROTC systems.

21:20.354 --> 21:28.464
Although the military academy system was 
superior in many ways, it was not common to that

21:20.354 --> 21:28.464
system. Okay, would you like to compare the Texas 
A&M system to the academy system, the West Point

21:28.484 --> 21:38.457
system? I can't do that for now because I don't even 
know what the system is. Back then, I mean... Oh,

21:41.601 --> 21:46.007
back then, yes, of course. As I said, the 
multi-academy system was superior in some ways.

21:52.151 --> 21:55.014
But in the simple way that I'm talking about, it was 
not. It took the military academy graduate much

21:55.955 --> 22:10.452
longer to acquire the things which the Texas A&M 
graduate had to acquire by living in it.

22:12.955 --> 22:15.758
But I want to make this plain. that in later years, 
when you're in the business of selecting people

22:17.341 --> 22:30.374
you know absolutely nothing about, and you have no 
other way to go, you'll take the military academy

22:17.341 --> 22:30.374
graduate. Why? Because he's been through 
something that is pretty goddamn tough. You know

22:36.800 --> 22:38.722
that much about him. He may be an utter bust, but you 
know that much about him. So that's why They do

22:45.100 --> 22:47.062
stand out in the military, and why? Frequently 
they get plus jobs because they should.

22:53.310 --> 23:00.819
But the system that I am admiring, and the old 
system, and I don't even know whether it still

22:53.310 --> 23:00.819
pertains to Texas A&M. I'm talking about what I 
know. I know it did not pertain in, for example, it

23:02.641 --> 23:13.133
does not pertain, for example, in the University 
of Texas ROTC system. It is not there, and there's

23:13.788 --> 23:17.132
no use talking about it. It isn't. The OTC system at 
the University of Texas that I observed when I was

23:18.233 --> 23:25.081
up there after retirement is totally different. 
Maybe it has some merits, but I've not had the one

23:26.783 --> 23:29.927
I'm talking about. I'm

23:29.947 --> 23:42.962
not saying that the Texas

23:29.947 --> 23:42.962
A&M College, now the university, is the ideal 
system. It isn't. I think it's proper to enter a

23:44.872 --> 23:54.605
criticism of it, since I have it complimented so 
highly, at least I think I have.

23:57.749 --> 24:00.854
This is not a criticism of the institution. 
There's not a criticism of the faculty when I'm

24:00.934 --> 24:05.340
about to voice. This is the style of the student 
body at the time I attended. Mind you, It was quite

24:14.352 --> 24:15.974
homogeneous then. The style of the student body 
probably was the genesis of the Aggie joke. The

24:25.186 --> 24:27.970
Aggie joke didn't exist when I was there, but it 
does now. It was to use vulgarisms, cliches, bad

24:30.273 --> 24:40.967
grammar, and be proud of it.

24:44.153 --> 24:48.458
This was a handicap.

24:48.478 --> 24:54.526
It was a handicap with a number of engineers, at 
least, who got out of it and didn't know they had.

24:57.249 --> 25:05.719
It did not handicap them in the preliminary work 
of, say, a bull gang to build a bridge or something

24:57.249 --> 25:05.719
of that sort. But when it came time to explain a more 
complex project, it was a handicap.

25:13.448 --> 25:22.997
was, in my opinion, the criticism of the 
institution at the time I went there, but not the

25:13.448 --> 25:22.997
institution as such. It was a student body. And if 
you want me to explain it, I can't. I'm just saying

25:29.023 --> 25:30.224
it existed. This, for example, in later years, you 
have to put people in place to do things. If you have

25:40.414 --> 25:41.515
a job, you don't have enough material, you don't 
have enough people, you don't have enough money,

25:43.857 --> 26:13.830
you're going to put a Texas A&M man, a youngster in 
charge of it, Georgia Tech, Iowa, an old land grant

25:43.857 --> 26:13.830
school guy, you don't put MIT, Yale, Stanford,

25:43.857 --> 26:13.830
because they're not good at that kind of thing. 
when they come right out. On the other hand, if you

26:16.780 --> 26:31.012
have a complex project to put out on paper, to lay it 
out in a persuasive way, you don't put that A&M man

26:16.780 --> 26:31.012
on it. You do put the other guy on it. Am I making 
myself clear? I'm trying to explain this

26:36.564 --> 26:39.328
particular handicap. I think when you compliment 
something, you ought to balance it. That's what

26:43.414 --> 26:44.476
I'm trying to do. Now,

26:44.736 --> 26:51.026
let's proceed. I didn't enter the service by 
intent.

27:01.398 --> 27:04.662
I was going to South America to build beautiful 
power plants. I knew what I wanted to do, and I knew

27:05.423 --> 27:08.066
how to go about it. You wanted to be an engineer 
first. Yes, of course, and a construction

27:10.029 --> 27:12.071
engineer. Because it is good work. But I'd worked 
in construction camps enough to know that it's

27:15.836 --> 27:22.183
good work, and it pays well. But when you work so, 
you don't have anybody to talk to. All right. I was

27:28.331 --> 27:30.173
walking back home from work. back from the mess 
hall one evening with another cop of a mechanical

27:30.355 --> 27:46.698
engineering graduate in the early spring, late 
summer, late winter, talking about what we were

27:30.355 --> 27:46.698
going to do after we finished. And he said he was 
going to the flying school. And I said, what flying

27:51.485 --> 27:54.529
school? And he told me, and it turns out they're 
running a flying school for free. down here in San

27:59.515 --> 28:00.997
Antonio. Well, I didn't know that. And, you know, 
it's hard to get around in South America. And I

28:09.386 --> 28:11.748
thought it would be pretty handy to learn how to 
fly. And so I checked into it and went to the flying

28:13.751 --> 28:20.518
school. Now, I liked the people. I liked to fly the 
airplanes. But more than anything else, it was

28:25.503 --> 28:28.847
something The people I enjoyed being with,

28:29.688 --> 28:45.047
and I don't regret it in any sense of the word, but I 
don't want to convey the idea that I went through

28:29.688 --> 28:45.047
the ROTC system at A&M with the idea of going in the 
military. I didn't at all. This was a

28:46.770 --> 28:49.213
happenstance.

28:52.637 --> 28:55.481
And I've enjoyed my service career. It fit what I 
like to do. But you didn't plan on this. You didn't

29:01.316 --> 29:04.500
plan on a military career. No, I didn't. I took the 
commission because it was available. When I

29:09.646 --> 29:12.149
finished the flying school, I knew I liked it. I 
liked the people I was with. Hell, some of my best

29:14.692 --> 29:21.901
friends, the classmates from flying school, and 
the only long, old-time friends I guess I've got.

29:23.503 --> 29:28.669
People that, I don't know, shared a common 
interest. It was fun. And that's how I got involved

29:33.008 --> 29:36.957
in the military. Can you tell me a little bit about 
the flying school? What type? It was down in San

29:41.327 --> 29:45.477
Antone, and you graduated there in 1929. What type 
of airplanes were you trained in? Well, at Brooks,

29:51.738 --> 29:57.166
Brooks was two sections, primary and basic. Yeah. 
And the advanced school was at Kelly. Yeah. And

30:00.490 --> 30:13.909
primary, we had a primary trainer, and basic we had 
a DH-4, a DH airplane, and at Kelly we had an

30:00.490 --> 30:13.909
old-fashioned B-4 and B-5 bomber. Those don't 
mean anything nowadays. They're sticking wire

30:15.431 --> 30:17.033
airplanes, all of them. The

30:17.266 --> 30:28.981
school was, of course, run to provide the Air Corps 
with pilots. Yes. But it also provided the

30:29.602 --> 30:31.985
airlines with pilots. You didn't have to come into 
the service, you see. Really? No. You were offered

30:37.472 --> 30:39.775
the chance if you wanted to. You did take a reserve 
commission. I already had one in the artillery,

30:44.181 --> 30:46.564
but I just transferred to the Air Corps. And since 
the regular commission was offered to graduates,

30:49.374 --> 31:01.826
college graduates, without examination, I just 
took it. See, I figured at the time I'd

31:02.507 --> 31:14.458
spend maybe another year flying airplanes to get 
that much more experience before I went on to South

31:02.507 --> 31:14.458
America. It turned out, as I said, I liked the 
people, I liked the work, I liked the airplanes,

31:14.742 --> 31:21.209
and stayed in. Simple. So once you graduated from 
flight school, then you decided not to go down to

31:23.632 --> 31:30.139
South America. You decided to stay... I still was, 
you might say I was ambivalent about it at the time.

31:35.745 --> 31:37.908
I finished flight school. I would say In 
retrospect, yes, I still intended to do that. But I

31:47.594 --> 31:51.901
thought that this much more flying experience 
would be helpful. It wasn't a bad decision because

31:52.021 --> 31:59.532
the flight school taught you to fly all right, no 
doubt of that. And all my classmates didn't come

32:00.394 --> 32:03.919
under the service, not at all. One, for example, an 
old friend up at San Angelo is a geophysicist. And

32:09.554 --> 32:14.780
he'd been around the world a good deal, too, 
working on various geophysical operations. And

32:14.860 --> 32:27.896
the exploration chief that he was associated with 
tried to get him to leave the flying school to come

32:14.860 --> 32:27.896
take over a job in Venezuela, for example. And at 
the time, I remember it so well, we were on DHs, and

32:28.878 --> 32:33.383
it was the time when the incomers were being washed 
out meeting the board. Well, he went to meet the

32:37.744 --> 32:46.055
board to get out to go do this thing along with these 
guys who were meeting the board who didn't want to

32:37.744 --> 32:46.055
get out. Well, he came back looking kind of funny 
and I asked him and he said, no, they're not going to

32:47.417 --> 32:52.244
let me out. Well, that suited him right down to the 
ground because he did want to go on through the

32:52.264 --> 32:57.651
flying school. He liked it. And it gave him an out 
with the guy that was trying to get him anyway when

32:59.173 --> 33:03.960
he When flying school was over, he did leave and 
went on down to South America and did a job and came

33:04.700 --> 33:13.852
back and did something here and so forth. That was 
the kind of thing. Now, when the war came, of

33:14.974 --> 33:18.659
course, he came back, got in uniform. Sure. In 
fact, he and I worked together for a while. But

33:22.243 --> 33:30.835
before we get too far ahead, I'd like you to talk a 
little bit about some of the things about the Corps

33:22.243 --> 33:30.835
cadets. What did you think about the hazing? Look, 
I told you that I'd been around the world a good

33:35.902 --> 33:45.375
deal. I

33:45.395 --> 33:54.146
don't know a good gentlemanly word to express what 
I thought about it. Nevertheless, I was kicked out

33:54.166 --> 33:57.491
one year for that. You were? This is a long story, 
and I'll shorten it up. It turned out that the

34:06.192 --> 34:15.905
youngster who made a case against me didn't

34:06.192 --> 34:15.905
get his facts straight. So when I met the board, the 
disciplinary board at NN, I didn't have to lie. I

34:25.338 --> 34:30.144
didn't have to because they didn't ask me the right 
questions. Nevertheless, they knew I was guilty

34:30.164 --> 34:33.128
of something, and I was. And so President was then 
Bazell, and when they eliminated me, this was a

34:35.065 --> 34:44.257
part and parcel of a pretty big uproar at the time. A 
whole goddamn troop of cavalrymen got kicked out

34:44.737 --> 34:49.443
at the same time I was in the artillery, as I told 
you. And I and one other from the artillery was

34:50.304 --> 34:54.229
kicked out. Anyway, Bazell called me in and asked 
me if I wanted to go up to what was then a part of A&M,

34:54.249 --> 35:04.482
Arlington, a two-year college at the time. 
Anyway, I went up there and finished out the year.

35:08.248 --> 35:15.376
This delayed me graduating from A&M, but on the 
other hand, gave me a chance to take some courses I

35:08.248 --> 35:15.376
wanted to take that weren't in the normal 
curriculum. To get back to your question, I

35:17.138 --> 35:32.315
can't express it in, I was contemptuous of it, 
let's put it that way. It is a piss poor way to run a

35:32.335 --> 35:34.958
railroad. It

35:36.187 --> 35:48.044
perpetuated the puerility and young men are all 
too prone to that anyhow, so I don't want to say any

35:36.187 --> 35:48.044
more about it. Okay, okay. It was a go-ahead. What 
did you like and what did you dislike about being in

35:52.851 --> 36:01.283
the Corps?

36:08.485 --> 36:10.047
You know, I never gave that any thought. I still 
haven't, apparently, because I don't seem to be

36:11.328 --> 36:15.312
able to answer your question. This is a thing you 
did. You did it in order to reach your goal. I didn't

36:22.880 --> 36:25.142
think about whether I liked it or disliked it.

36:28.085 --> 36:28.586
Wait a minute. I can say what I liked about it.

36:34.151 --> 36:35.893
At the time, I went through We were horse drawn 
artillery. And we could go to the stables over the

36:39.762 --> 36:49.316
weekend and get a horse and ride in the 
countryside, free his hair. That was great. My

36:52.520 --> 36:58.628
roommate, my last year roommate, was a member of 
the pistol team. And we could go. Of course, he had a

37:01.613 --> 37:04.917
pistol that he shot with that was different. And 
draw ammunition. and go out in the country and

37:06.957 --> 37:14.688
shoot targets, or rabbits, if we wanted to.

37:17.872 --> 37:25.223
The work, the academic work, with a few 
exceptions, was a challenge. And I personally

37:25.804 --> 37:28.868
like challenges. I like that. To ask me what I 
didn't like about it, oh, Howard Soldier.

37:42.486 --> 37:47.172
That

37:42.486 --> 37:47.172
style, I didn't like that. There was no way to say 
you didn't like it or act as though you didn't like

37:48.674 --> 37:52.459
it. But I want to be clear about this. My English 
prof, one year assigned and one I managed to get

37:56.345 --> 38:06.158
into his class, was an Oxford graduate. with 
Laurels in English, there was nothing wrong with

38:06.644 --> 38:09.947
the faculty. There was nothing the faculty could 
do about this.

38:16.353 --> 38:17.254
I didn't like that. I

38:17.274 --> 38:29.485
liked being a battery commander in my senior year. 
It was a responsible job, and any responsible job

38:30.486 --> 38:36.432
is a gratifying job.

38:39.348 --> 38:43.113
I don't mean by that that I think I was popular. I 
don't think I was. In fact, I think I was probably

38:44.836 --> 38:51.465
pretty generally disliked because I was 
different. And goddammit, I had to be. I was older.

38:53.688 --> 39:03.021
As you can tell from my age when I graduated, I was 
older than my contemporaries and hadn't been

38:53.688 --> 39:03.021
around more. Much of what they were interested in, 
I thought, was pretty childish. I don't want to say

39:08.423 --> 39:12.147
any more about this because I'm afraid I'm 
sounding too critical.

39:15.750 --> 39:17.052
Well, I have another question. You became general 
officer. In what way do you think A&M or the Corps of

39:20.755 --> 39:31.466
Cadets helped you in becoming a position of that 
responsibility?

39:33.669 --> 39:38.093
I have to be explicit. And in the way I told you 
about, in the understanding that there are no

39:38.326 --> 39:54.906
duplicates in human beings, we're dealing with 
equipment which has to be duplicate. Every part

39:55.026 --> 39:56.388
has to be the same. It allowed me to avoid the common 
misunderstanding in the military that men are

39:57.970 --> 40:05.058
that way too. They're not. A&M helped me with that, 
in fact, probably taught me this, but certainly

40:06.440 --> 40:15.035
much more than I learned in the construction 
business, for example. I think I learned that at

40:16.858 --> 40:20.304
A&M, and I think it was very helpful. Also, in the 
early years of your service, engineering is is

40:29.727 --> 40:33.691
probably the best type of education, academic. 
That's why the academies are basically

40:34.672 --> 40:37.534
engineering schools. As time goes on, that is no 
longer true. Technology is a given. You have to

40:48.645 --> 40:56.873
understand it, but you don't have to deal with it 
intimately.

40:56.893 --> 40:58.114
In my observation, There comes a time in your 
service when perhaps you might have been better

40:58.887 --> 41:03.855
trained in law. Later on, there's a time when 
perhaps you might have been better trained in,

41:04.996 --> 41:11.446
say, international relationships. There's 
never a time when history is inappropriate.

41:17.155 --> 41:24.827
History must,

41:17.155 --> 41:24.827
because it is the explanation of forces which you 
must deal with in your later years. In fact, in your

41:29.107 --> 41:31.970
years as a general officer. But those things which 
a general officer most often is required to deal

41:31.990 --> 41:43.741
with, you don't learn in school.

41:44.782 --> 41:53.430
Let me talk about two men who are on your list who I 
think exemplify the qualities that I am going to

41:54.406 --> 41:57.129
try to describe. One of them is Al Ludeke. Do you 
know him? Yes, I've interviewed him. He's in and

42:00.993 --> 42:02.574
out of A&M. Al is a very talented man. He has proved 
it in many pursuits. The other one is Bernie

42:11.744 --> 42:15.327
Schriever, who's in Washington. Now, both these 
men have something that I don't have, so I can I can

42:23.853 --> 42:28.177
single them out better to illustrate what I'm 
talking about. There comes a time when you're

42:28.197 --> 42:47.217
required to solve problems to oversimplify the 
political and the administrative function. You

42:47.237 --> 42:48.358
solve them by reason of knowing what this force 
wants and this force wants and what this force

42:48.997 --> 43:02.377
wants and what you might approximate to get the job 
done that goddammit you ought to get done. Now, you

43:03.459 --> 43:05.041
don't learn this in school. Neither, I mean, both 
Al and Bernie are good engineers, but that isn't

43:07.645 --> 43:16.759
what caused them to be successful. It's this 
quality that I don't believe I can describe to you,

43:17.768 --> 43:35.586
that both of them had, and if you haven't already, 
you will talk to them,

43:17.768 --> 43:35.586
this ability.

43:35.606 --> 43:47.218
Now, I want to point out that just the background 
and the quality doesn't ensure success. I want to

43:49.055 --> 43:53.941
point out the obvious that so many men overlook. 
The quality of luck. The business of time and place

43:57.086 --> 44:00.270
and luck. You can't overlook that. Hell, I know 
lots of better men than I am. I never got to be

44:07.339 --> 44:09.101
generals. Some of them, unfortunately, blame 
themselves for it, and they couldn't be wronger.

44:18.788 --> 44:21.070
And you might keep that in mind for yourself. I 
don't give a damn what you're doing. Luck is going

44:26.376 --> 44:28.638
to enter into it. Which one is more important, the 
individual's own characteristics and training

44:29.178 --> 44:36.405
or luck? Oh, obviously it's characteristics 
because you can't do anything about luck.

44:47.257 --> 44:49.100
I think that's pretty obvious. Okay, well let's go 
back now to, you graduated from flying school, you

44:49.120 --> 45:05.105
became a second lieutenant in the Army Air Corps in 
1929, and then your first duty station, was that at

44:49.120 --> 45:05.105
the Air Corps Technical School? Oh no, no, Dodd 
Field, right across the way. Okay. And Dodd and

45:09.792 --> 45:13.298
Book's Field, observation. And what were you 
doing there? normal second lieutenant duties. I

45:17.359 --> 45:22.724
was assistant operations and assistant 
engineering and that sort of thing. I had to do

45:22.764 --> 45:26.348
other, back then you did everything. But your
