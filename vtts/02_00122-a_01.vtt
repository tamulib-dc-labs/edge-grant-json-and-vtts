WEBVTT

00:08.485 --> 00:25.221
Trying a second time to see if the microphone will 
work, pinning it on my tie, looking out the window

00:08.485 --> 00:25.221
in the next room away from the machine, trying to 
hope that it will work, wondering, wondering if it

00:08.485 --> 00:25.221
will this time. End of test.

00:53.272 --> 01:08.453
We're now on May the 7th, sitting in the front room 
down on Lee Hollow in Bryan, chatting with Austin

00:53.272 --> 01:08.453
Curley, who spells that A-U-S-T-O-N, 
K-E-R-L-E-Y. Mr. Curley has been here a long time.

01:12.899 --> 01:20.089
Austin, would you first, for someone who may not 
know you, who might read this material or listen to

01:12.899 --> 01:20.089
the tape, in the future, would you briefly 
summarize your experience prior to the time you

01:20.761 --> 01:28.388
came back to A&M to join the faculty and staff? 
Where did you grow up and when did you get to A&M and

01:28.408 --> 01:31.511
so forth? Well, I think that my mother and father 
were, they were farmers in Collingwood County.

01:45.465 --> 01:49.789
And things were difficult for them. I was number 
four of the four children who survived the time of

01:50.613 --> 02:02.936
life. As a matter of fact, I was a twin, and my twin 
brother died the first day. And so it goes. At the

02:14.727 --> 02:22.898
time I was born, our family had left the farm and 
moved to Bonham, Texas. I guess in those days that

02:22.918 --> 02:29.006
would have been moving to the big city.

02:29.026 --> 02:40.161
We were in Bonham a few years where my father was 
able to get a job with the Missouri, Kansas, and

02:29.026 --> 02:40.161
Texas Railways. I guess that would be equivalent 
to today's air or what have you. Well, we moved from

02:48.354 --> 02:55.705
Bonham to Itasca.

02:56.165 --> 02:58.048
He had a better job. And we lived there for about two 
years. And then he moved up the road, so to speak, to

03:03.877 --> 03:08.764
Hillsborough. And there, we were there three or 
four years. This painting up here over the clock is

03:19.100 --> 03:27.529
the Hillsboro-Cady

03:19.100 --> 03:27.529
Railroad Station. Now, that was where my father 
worked. It was a few years later that we're talking

03:32.854 --> 03:37.519
about. There was a platform out at the back where 
that white horse is. And so my father bought me a

03:43.947 --> 03:55.479
little metal, all metal tricycle and would let me 
play with it on the platform. Well, the platform

03:55.499 --> 03:59.143
was built to standard height for wagons. And I was 
scared to get within 10 feet of the edge, so he had no

04:00.464 --> 04:07.692
problems there. And that was the way he kept me. And 
that was so my mother could pick cotton. And well,

04:15.605 --> 04:20.673
we moved to Hillsboro. And from there, my father, 
you see the union, you bid on the job. So he bid on the

04:32.049 --> 04:34.152
job at Sherman And we moved to Sherman in 1921. It

04:37.926 --> 04:43.872
was a fortunate thing for us. It was a city with 
excellent schools, three or four colleges, and a

04:43.892 --> 04:55.364
very promising community. We had a library, 
Carnegie Library.

05:04.523 --> 05:08.229
even at the age of, I was in first grade. We lived two 
blocks from the library. So we made many trips to

05:13.838 --> 05:24.354
the library, my sisters and myself and my older 
brother. I became an avid reader and I read They'd

05:33.059 --> 05:50.756
have to run me out of the adult section 
occasionally because they realized I was not

05:33.059 --> 05:50.756
ready to read, not so much whether it was, as they 
say, dirty or not, but it would just be something I

05:33.059 --> 05:50.756
wouldn't understand. So, back to the kids section 
I would go. But I became a great supporter of

05:56.943 --> 06:02.408
libraries. I'm that way today. For several years, 
I would shelve books at the Bryan Public Library.

06:12.687 --> 06:15.109
Got a big kick out of it, Bill Barzak and I. Well, I 
entered the public schools, George Washington

06:16.371 --> 06:26.121
Elementary School in Sherman, first grade. And 
schooling was relatively easy for me. I enjoyed

06:32.037 --> 06:34.921
it.

06:39.147 --> 06:47.499
I think that as I look back on it, it was fortunate 
because we had a good quality of teachers.

06:48.040 --> 07:00.998
Teachers were highly regarded, and from good 
colleges, and the community supported good

06:48.040 --> 07:00.998
schools. Well, I went through elementary, junior 
high school, as they called it, and then high

07:02.665 --> 07:13.536
school. It was 11 grades then. And I got off a year 
early there. But I graduated with a reasonably

07:21.344 --> 07:28.572
good grade. I worked in the afternoons and on 
Saturday as a stock boy in the 5 and 10 cent store.

07:41.082 --> 07:52.256
And that was good because I was getting up of an age 
that I think my parents felt I needed to work. Work

07:52.316 --> 07:54.759
was important. And I stayed out of college a year to 
work and save what I could.

08:08.893 --> 08:15.741
I think that helped me also to kind of get my sights 
settled better. So my brother in the meantime had

08:15.761 --> 08:22.909
entered Texas A&M in architecture. But he had a man 
in Sherman who was backing him, they used to say, to

08:24.222 --> 08:35.053
see that he had the money to go. Well, the sophomore 
year at A&M for him was a very disastrous thing

08:36.134 --> 08:51.951
because in October the bottom fell out of 
everything. And about two months later, he came to

08:52.657 --> 09:00.304
my brother and told him, he said, I deeply regret 
this. But he said, I'm going to be lucky to keep this

09:00.324 --> 09:05.209
business. And all our own family will have to work. 
Well, my brother went two years, worked a year, and

09:11.675 --> 09:19.443
then two years. I did the same thing. I worked. two 
years and stayed out and then worked two years.

09:27.853 --> 09:46.561
Now, the library helped me out though because 
during that year I worked, I figured that if I got a

09:27.853 --> 09:46.561
job at Texas A&M, I'd have to have something that 
would give me an inside approach.

09:46.581 --> 09:52.009
So I decided I would try to work in the library. So I 
went down to the librarian at the library and told

09:52.445 --> 10:00.136
her what my predicament was. And she said, yes, she 
said, I would be willing to work with you. And if you

10:05.924 --> 10:16.620
would, this will take now about three months every 
night to do what I want you to do. So we started out.

10:18.682 --> 10:21.186
So I would work all day as a stock boy. go buy the 
dairy, which was right behind me. Now, that is the

10:28.280 --> 10:31.143
sale. And I would buy a quart of milk. And I would 
drink a quart of milk, and then I would head out for

10:34.647 --> 10:39.352
the library. Well, in about three months, why, she 
finally said, I think you're ready to work in the

10:40.293 --> 10:48.943
library. And they carried me through all the 
departments. So I wrote Dr. Mayo, Thomas F. Mayo, a

10:51.710 --> 11:02.045
great man, in my opinion. And I told him, I've done 
all this work. I sent my only copy that I had of

11:05.390 --> 11:14.022
anything in writing because there was no way in 
those days to make a copy. I don't know what ever

11:15.318 --> 11:24.548
happened to it, but they did write back and say I 
could expect to be used in the library. So I started

11:25.129 --> 11:36.381
next to him in the fall of 34, and I majored in 
economics. To tell you the truth, I didn't want

11:38.463 --> 11:45.190
else to major.

11:45.693 --> 11:54.282
In 1934, liberal arts students had a little, quite 
a bit of hazing. What do you think you're going to do

11:55.243 --> 11:58.867
with that when you get through? Well, it was all 
right. It was in good spirits, and you learned by

12:01.410 --> 12:06.455
listening. There are ways of coming back with 
that, but you have to listen to people that know

12:07.156 --> 12:12.161
what to say. Well, I... I did well in my grades,

12:15.123 --> 12:22.913
but I learned a lot the hard way. In the first 
semester that I was in school, I had better than a B.

12:23.414 --> 12:37.453
I thought, you know, I'm going to get all this. I 
can't. So I was eligible, so I took 21 hours. The

12:45.042 --> 12:50.128
second semester, well, I was working 20 hours. 
Well, I thought I was going to die, but I was too

12:51.850 --> 12:55.715
stubborn to back out. So I made the semester all 
right, but I learned a lesson. I learned a lesson to

13:04.366 --> 13:05.868
be able to. I never will forget, I walked into that 
college. It was in psychology. And I was the only

13:12.397 --> 13:16.482
freshman in the class. And that, in 1934, a 
freshman in a class of juniors and seniors was not

13:16.502 --> 13:26.716
particularly welcomed. And there was a senior in 
the class, though. And he said, fisherman, what

13:31.242 --> 13:35.127
are you doing taking that course? And I told him. He 
said, well, what do you think? I said, I think I made

13:39.132 --> 13:41.475
a mistake. He said, well, come around, I'll help 
you. So I learned one of many, many lessons. Well,

13:50.638 --> 14:10.247
the

13:50.638 --> 14:10.247
life in the Corps was very variable to me because I 
had a life that was expectancy was clear and

13:50.638 --> 14:10.247
concise. and you had confidence that it would 
happen, and you could depend on it. My roommate was

14:21.861 --> 14:31.874
a Mexican-American boy from San Antonio, Rudolfo 
San Miguel. Now, how did you two get linked up as

14:32.475 --> 14:35.860
roommates? Do you know? I don't know, but I have a 
hunch. The company commander Mr. Allen had been a

14:41.682 --> 15:07.622
freshman under my brother see I didn't have any 
better sense but go get in the same company my

14:41.682 --> 15:07.622
brother had been in I didn't have much sense on some 
of those things well Mr. Allen Mr. Allen put us

14:41.682 --> 15:07.622
together and I I loved that man like a brother How 
were Hispanics treated in the student body then?

15:14.270 --> 15:19.635
They were treated cordially.

15:20.696 --> 15:32.307
Now, when it came to social events, neither one 
particularly wanted to do what the other wanted to

15:20.696 --> 15:32.307
do. But in the company itself, well, now, Rudolfo 
had a brother, Arturo San Miguel, who was a

15:36.863 --> 15:43.250
sophomore. He started here early. These two men 
both were distinguished students every semester

15:45.572 --> 15:53.080
they went. Arturo was a mechanical engineering 
graduate, and Rudolfo was an architect. I was very

16:02.670 --> 16:05.453
fortunate. These two young men were true 
gentlemen. Courteous, funny, fun-loving, but

16:11.948 --> 16:20.522
respected your privacy. Yes, they were great. 
During the years, I visited his family in San

16:23.907 --> 16:27.853
Antonio. He came up to Sherman and visited my 
family. And we... we, we had great regard for each

16:34.711 --> 16:37.295
other. I, later, there, there, we, the junior 
year, we had, we had another Mexican-American,

16:38.817 --> 16:59.029
that, two of them and myself. He had, he had been a 
worker in the dining hall, and then there were

17:03.061 --> 17:15.816
barracks back of Sebesta where single men could 
live, and he lived in there. Well, he would, he

17:16.437 --> 17:21.322
fought his way through, he finally graduated. 
Well, the,

17:22.644 --> 17:32.055
now, Rudolfo had a five-year program So the year I 
stayed out, evened us up, and it was a good

17:32.963 --> 17:41.674
arrangement. Well, I got my degree, and I had 
worked in the summers for the AAA, the Cotton

17:42.235 --> 17:54.831
Program. And

17:55.131 --> 18:01.840
I was offered a job, two or three jobs, in Dallas. 
But I didn't want to go to Dallas. Well, I think I

18:07.510 --> 18:13.237
simply had not found what I really wanted to do. And 
maybe that was the excuse. But I worked for the AAA

18:17.521 --> 18:30.696
from June until about April.

18:31.807 --> 18:45.371
was offered a job with the Farm Credit 
Administration out of Dallas as a field

18:31.807 --> 18:45.371
supervisor on emergency crop lawns, drought and 
things like that. Well, it was a good job, and in the

18:45.972 --> 18:54.608
meantime, Melba and I were married in the fall of 
39. And she had been an art major at

18:55.550 --> 19:07.724
Texas State College for Women. TSCW then. Yeah, it 
was, well, her first year was CIA. CIA. Well, we

19:14.833 --> 19:23.683
were detailed to, or sent to Crockett, And I had 
five counties. Crawford was the most eastern

19:28.350 --> 19:34.297
point, and Hearn was the other end of it. And this 
was a very pleasant two years before World War II

19:34.317 --> 19:42.326
broke out. World War II broke out, and I was sent my 
greetings, of course, pretty quick. and I was on

19:51.153 --> 20:06.490
the cadre of the 90th Infantry Division and I

19:51.153 --> 20:06.490
enjoyed my duty as a platoon leader. I stayed with 
that cadre through the battalion maneuvers and

20:07.130 --> 20:18.122
then I was ordered that what's called the detached 
officer list, I think, where you are pulled out and

20:19.132 --> 20:37.319
I was assigned ROTCU

20:19.132 --> 20:37.319
and sent to New Mexico A&M at Las Cruces. Well I had a 
very, we moved out there, had a very interesting

20:38.501 --> 20:47.755
time and I found a great deal of interest and 
satisfaction in working with these young men and

20:48.308 --> 21:00.827
it was just kind of like finding a home. Well, I 
stayed there a year and we also were operating the

21:02.209 --> 21:13.446
Army Specialized Training Program.

21:15.029 --> 21:15.109
This wrote a book about it someone did scholars and 
foxholes well those young scholars in the

21:16.523 --> 21:45.973
february of 44 found themselves down for dealing 
with truth and i i i really feel that was a bad faith

21:16.523 --> 21:45.973
on the part of federal government because i had men 
in my company that had were tech sergeants And

21:46.831 --> 21:52.058
they lost it all. Instead of getting their rank 
back, they were sent and replaced. Well, I was sent

21:57.205 --> 22:07.219
from Las Cruces to Arlington, and I stayed there a 
year. uh while i was at arlington i was detailed to

22:08.448 --> 22:33.190
the command general staff college as a student 
with the zone of interior course and rated a

22:08.448 --> 22:33.190
superior i i like the military but i like teaching 
better i could have it both Well, I think that that

22:33.676 --> 22:46.373
was a significant point in my life, that I almost 
had my future structured

22:33.676 --> 22:46.373
as I went through this. Well, when the war was over, 
and I was sent back to making cattle feed loans, I

22:46.393 --> 22:59.210
knew I had to get back. So we came back to Sherman. 
And we made it through a difficult three or four

23:04.642 --> 23:11.412
months. And then I was offered a position with the 
Sherman Public Schools to organize the first

23:11.432 --> 23:24.650
distributive education program in the school. 
And

23:25.892 --> 23:34.564
that fitted my structure because these young 
people were in school, and then would work in the

23:34.831 --> 23:40.779
afternoon training stations. And I deeply 
enjoyed this. I did this two years, and then I

23:45.766 --> 23:53.377
realized I should be getting on with graduate 
school. So we talked about it. In the meantime, at

23:57.262 --> 24:01.969
that point, we had four children. And Melvin said, 
well, if we're going to have this family and we've

24:03.603 --> 24:13.757
got them, we're not going to make it on just you 
teaching. So she said, we'll go over to Denton and

24:13.777 --> 24:26.094
you do your graduate work, and I'll see what I can do 
about completing my undergraduate. So we did

24:26.114 --> 24:27.035
this. And we were there in Denton for two years. And 
I finished a master's and got accepted in their

24:33.134 --> 24:42.627
doctoral program, the first one. I was in the first 
one. And you see, I could leave my work at Foreign

24:45.571 --> 24:53.883
Astronomy, for example, and take a course. And it 
was very meaningful.

25:02.429 --> 25:19.254
about that time the public schools in Sherman 
asked me to please come back and they wanted me to be

25:02.429 --> 25:19.254
vice principal of the hospital and director of 
guidance. I had a principal who was very

25:19.274 --> 25:24.201
progressive and and I was ready. I had gotten 
proper training. I started my degree in business

25:30.718 --> 25:38.631
administration, but I changed over to guidance. 
Well, I went over to Sherman, Melba State at Denton

25:38.651 --> 25:50.070
with the children, and my wife's brother came over 
from Sherman to enter graduate school. He was a

25:56.722 --> 25:58.224
naval veteran. So he would stay at our house. And 
then on Friday he would come home and I would come

26:02.591 --> 26:06.637
home. Well, we worked this out. And then in March of 
that year, I had a telephone call from Dr. Bertram

26:15.160 --> 26:22.847
at the basic division down here. And he said, I want 
to talk to you about coming to Texas A&M. And so

26:30.995 --> 26:44.408
Alvin and I went down on Friday, and we were still 
having classes on Saturdays. Dean Bertrand told

26:44.945 --> 26:51.915
me about the Basic Division. And really, 
Haskell's Basic Division was nothing in the world

26:51.935 --> 27:07.776
but a strong guidance-centered structure, but 
with academic

26:51.935 --> 27:07.776
emphasis. And that fitted my background very 
well. And I felt very comfortable about being able

27:15.539 --> 27:27.810
to handle relationships with the Corps. Now, this 
was what year? 1952. 52. March of 52. All right. And

27:33.775 --> 27:35.217
then when does he offer you? He offered me a job 
about the next week. What was the beginning pay?

27:41.502 --> 27:44.445
$4,000, I believe. For 12 months. Well, he said, we 
will try for 12 months. See, we also, that, you

27:52.794 --> 28:03.768
know, I came down here with great enthusiasm and 
support of this program. Because, and the

28:03.808 --> 28:14.040
remarkable thing was that the major person in it 
was an engineer, Mr. Gilchrist. And he foresaw the

28:16.762 --> 28:22.751
difficulty that the freshman students were 
having in the freshman year. So he put the first

28:22.771 --> 28:27.959
year students all out at the air base. Now was that 
still, when you came that fall of 52, were they

28:29.542 --> 28:37.514
freshmen still out? No, because in 51, You see, the 
war broke out with Korea. Oh, and that took place.

28:44.951 --> 28:50.016
And so they said we got to have this facility back. 
So you began September? No, I began July the 1st,

28:52.819 --> 28:56.463
1952. At that point, describe the campus 
physically. What buildings, what were the

29:03.351 --> 29:05.533
primary buildings where? Oh, there's little or no 
difference except the Memorial Student Center.

29:16.117 --> 29:17.258
No difference from? 1939. Okay, but make believe 
that I had never seen the campus. Well, now the YMCA

29:22.965 --> 29:27.471
was still... a very important cog in the life, 
off-campus life.

29:37.933 --> 29:39.796
It was still functioning. But the Memorial
