00:01.904 --> 00:03.866
Crowne Plaza Hotel in Dallas. Farmer's Branch. 
Farmer's Branch. Sorry about that. Don't let the

00:07.832 --> 00:10.074
city manager hear you say it. OK. And this is Bob 
Cornish, and I'm interviewing Bill Shevlin today

00:10.855 --> 00:20.968
of Farmer's Branch. And Bill has a rather varied 
background in planning and has brought a lot of

00:20.988 --> 00:28.738
resources to the Texas scene. Bill, would you like 
to start with your planning education and

00:29.309 --> 00:39.086
whatever your first experience was in Texas 
planning?

00:40.949 --> 00:51.267
Well, my original education was a bachelor's of 
architecture from Texas A&M, and I was in the

00:40.949 --> 00:51.267
service, and then I came back to Fort Worth and 
worked in architecture, and decided that I, that

00:52.462 --> 01:17.763
that was too limiting, and I went off to, made 
application, was accepted, went off to the

00:52.462 --> 01:17.763
University of Pennsylvania in 1961, in the fall of 
61, and entered the joint program there, and was

00:52.462 --> 01:17.763
there two years and ended up with a master's degree 
in architecture and a master's degree in city

00:52.462 --> 01:17.763
planning. And following that, immediately 
following that, I came to Back to Texas, really not

01:23.174 --> 01:34.290
knowing what I was going to do for sure, but I came to 
Dallas to meet the man who had given me a fellowship

01:23.174 --> 01:34.290
at Pennsylvania for two years. We lived in Dallas, 
and he insisted that when I had lunch with him after

01:35.071 --> 01:50.953
lunch, he insisted that he take me over to meet a 
very close friend of his that he referred to as

01:35.071 --> 01:50.953
Sprung. who turned out to be Marvin Springer. And 
so he took me to Sprung's office. And I think the

01:57.047 --> 02:00.690
conversation went something like this. Sprung, 
you need somebody on your staff from the

02:02.992 --> 02:07.676
University of Pennsylvania. Shevlin, you need to 
be in Dallas working with Springer. And before the

02:12.401 --> 02:19.607
afternoon was out, I was working for Springer. He 
had not intended to hire anybody, and I had not

02:19.823 --> 02:24.751
intended to go to work for anybody in Dallas. And I 
was subsequently with Marvin for about two years

02:24.771 --> 02:32.564
as an associate in his firm. At one time, we had 
Marvin and myself as an associate, Doyle Smith as

02:33.686 --> 02:45.426
an associate who had a background in civil 
engineering, and Frank Osgood, who had a

02:33.686 --> 02:45.426
background in economics. And he had come from 
Tulsa. He had come from, he may have come from

02:48.747 --> 02:53.011
Tulsa. I know his brother was involved in planting 
up there, but he may have come from Tulsa.

03:00.898 --> 03:15.531
It was during that period of time when I was with 
Marvin, a lot of our work was centered around 701

03:00.898 --> 03:15.531
projects, which I found, as Marvin found, was 
very, very difficult to do in Texas. There was a lot

03:21.312 --> 03:28.963
of hand-holding and not a lot of prospect for 
implementation after the fact. The biggest

03:29.003 --> 03:36.174
project I worked on with Marvin, public project 
while I was with him, was the city of Galveston. We

03:36.875 --> 03:40.681
did the comprehensive plan for the city of 
Galveston during that period. And I did a lot of

03:40.701 --> 03:45.788
work on the housing analysis and component 
community facilities and all of that. And we did

03:50.556 --> 03:56.421
work in other cities, 701 planning. He was doing 
some work in Denison at that time, in Plano. And I

04:04.689 --> 04:06.530
can't remember all the cities now. There were a 
number of them. And I was not involved in all of

04:07.971 --> 04:09.453
them. I was involved in most of them in one way or 
another. Galveston was the one that I was involved

04:13.016 --> 04:15.218
in beginning to end.

04:19.570 --> 04:25.237
You may say anything about Marvin, my view of 
Marvin. Marvin was, at that time, and I've had

04:25.257 --> 04:33.627
occasion to work with him in a different capacity 
on a couple of occasions since. One was with

04:34.848 --> 04:44.800
respect to the Flower Mound Newtown planning, 
which he represented the city of Flower Mound, and

04:34.848 --> 04:44.800
later I worked with him when he was representing 
the city of Plano, and I was working with a major

04:44.982 --> 04:49.568
tract of land out there. But Marvin, I considered 
the time spent with Marvin to be very valuable

04:49.588 --> 04:59.700
postgraduate work, because I found him to be very 
knowledgeable. I found him to be the best I've ever

04:59.921 --> 05:13.217
met in my entire life in getting people to work 
together towards some objectives which they may

04:59.921 --> 05:13.217
not share in common. He was a great facilitator. I 
say was only because he retired from active

05:15.542 --> 05:19.968
practice. By the time he was in active practice, he 
was very people-oriented, very much capable of

05:20.749 --> 05:33.026
seeing problems freshly and dealing with them. 
One of the things he used to say quite often was, I'm

05:33.106 --> 05:42.799
not a solution walking around looking for a 
problem.

05:43.927 --> 05:46.971
His population estimates held up better. If you go 
back and check them, you'll find they've held up

05:47.571 --> 05:56.902
better than probably any, certainly any at that 
time, and maybe any since because of the way he went

05:47.571 --> 05:56.902
about doing it. And I just think he probably more 
than anyone else made a major contribution to what

05:58.003 --> 06:10.558
we consider to be planning in the state of Texas. He 
was a great innovator in the area of ordinances.

06:16.689 --> 06:28.062
Just because many, many cities in Texas have 
ordinances which he prepared 20, 25 years ago that

06:16.689 --> 06:28.062
became obsolete, it's not his fault because they 
were very much on the mark at the time. It's just

06:28.083 --> 06:31.286
that the city's never got around to revising. 
Farmer's Branch is a good example, which is now

06:31.306 --> 06:35.972
going through a comprehensive planning process 
for the first time. will sometime within the next

06:36.526 --> 06:43.314
year revise Marvin's zoning ordinance for the 
first time. At any rate, Marvin made a great

06:44.856 --> 06:51.905
contribution, and I consider it to be a real 
privilege to have a chance to work with him.

06:51.985 --> 06:56.550
Everything I learned from Marvin I've used to 
advantage since. How long were you with Marvin? I

07:01.536 --> 07:04.660
was with Marvin for about two years and left. only 
because I received a phone call one day as I was at

07:04.994 --> 07:11.283
work sitting on the drafting stool working on a 
plan. And the person on the other end of the line

07:12.184 --> 07:15.348
said, this is Don Foley. I'm head of the Department 
of City Regional Planning at Berkeley. And we have

07:19.494 --> 07:23.880
a position to fill on the staff next year. We have a 
professor going on sabbatical. It was Mel Scott.

07:30.449 --> 07:32.612
You've been recommended to us. Would you be 
interested in coming to Berkeley for a year? And so

07:35.420 --> 07:38.623
I thought about three seconds, and I said yes. And 
so that's the reason I left here. You were there for

07:43.427 --> 07:44.328
a year? I was there for a year, and I was offered 
another year to stay there for another year. I was

07:56.999 --> 08:02.444
also offered a position to go over to Berkeley and 
become the city planner. I was offered a position

08:02.504 --> 08:04.566
in Oakland, offered a position by Alan Jacobs when 
he went to San Francisco to come head up urban

08:05.035 --> 08:13.224
design in San Francisco. And I didn't. Norman Lynn 
was an Oakland. Norman Lynn was an Oakland. And I

08:16.827 --> 08:27.138
did none of those things because in the middle of my 
time in California, I got married to a Dallas girl

08:16.827 --> 08:27.138
who got homesick and wanted to come back. 
Interesting change in career direction. That's

08:31.703 --> 08:32.083
right. So that's the reason I probably ended up 
back in Dallas. And

08:34.921 --> 08:59.175
Marvin was, one of the other things that happened 
when I worked with Marvin is that I immediately

08:34.921 --> 08:59.175
became very aware of the professional 
organizations and also the educational

08:34.921 --> 08:59.175
organizations in Texas relating to planning 
because Marvin was what I consider to be a

08:34.921 --> 08:59.175
professional's professional. He was very much 
behind planning education. He was It was one of the

09:03.102 --> 09:21.729
people who had been instrumental in establishing 
AIP as a professional organization and a force in

09:03.102 --> 09:21.729
Texas, along with people like Ralph Elliford and 
Bill... Who am I trying to say? No, and... John

09:22.249 --> 09:28.118
Cunningham.

09:28.138 --> 09:29.580
I mean, John Cunningham, not Bill. John 
Cunningham. I know what Bill Cunningham... John

09:30.261 --> 09:31.843
Cunningham. Bill Singleton out of Louisiana, 
people like that. And I immediately, through

09:40.132 --> 09:46.803
Marvin, came into contact with all these people 
who were also very, very fine people. I'm trying to

09:49.167 --> 09:52.012
establish when the chapter was created. It was 
originally the Gulf Southwest chapter. It was in

09:57.305 --> 10:00.008
existence before I came in 1961. So I would say that 
it was created probably during the time that

10:00.088 --> 10:12.984
Marvin was still planning director in Dallas, a 
period which was from 1950 to 1959 sometime. So I

10:13.605 --> 10:17.349
would say it was probably four or five years before 
that day was established. Oh, it was Marvin.

10:23.977 --> 10:26.420
By the way, Marvin is writing the history of 
planning in Dallas. Is he? I would say that the time

10:29.300 --> 10:57.332
I came to Texas in 1961 and at the time I left Texas in 
1963 to go to California and at the time I came back

10:29.300 --> 10:57.332
in 1965, left in 65, came back in 66, that nothing 
had changed, that AIP as a professional

10:29.300 --> 10:57.332
organization was relatively weak. because there 
weren't enough planners with any credentials to

10:58.105 --> 11:08.375
create any kind of critical mass and therefore any 
influence. By far Marvin was the most influential

11:08.656 --> 11:14.962
person in the state with respect to the state. He 
had a tremendous

11:15.603 --> 11:24.131
standing with state agencies in particular with 
the Texas State Highway Department. So he was the

11:24.151 --> 11:25.733
one who When it was necessary to get somebody out 
front, Marvin was usually the one that was out

11:26.793 --> 11:32.142
front. The other thing that was, I think, fair to 
say is that planning education in Texas was

11:32.162 --> 11:41.016
practically nonexistent, as we would think of it 
today. And both of those things were very... The

11:43.179 --> 11:45.523
only program at all was at UT Austin. That's right. 
And it wasn't... Hugo was down there, but it wasn't

11:46.204 --> 11:50.151
really much of a program. It was more of a... I don't 
know what to say, specialty within architecture,

11:54.620 --> 12:05.154
which is the worst place, weren't the worst place, 
the only worst place in architecture, or equally

11:54.620 --> 12:05.154
worst place to be engineering. At any rate, it just 
didn't exist. And so consequently, my

12:08.818 --> 12:15.046
involvement at that time, when I was with Marvin, 
was rather limited. There was really no place here

12:15.066 --> 12:19.412
for me to... to teach anything, and I also thought 
at that time I hadn't learned enough to teach

12:20.185 --> 12:25.853
anything, so that worked out fine. That doesn't 
bother some of our current students. I

12:29.258 --> 12:31.642
understand. But the other side of it, with respect 
to AIP, I did start getting involved with AIP, and

12:32.083 --> 12:45.843
Marvin encouraged people who worked for him to do 
that, but it was... And I can't remember. I know

12:45.943 --> 12:47.205
that the first... The first section meeting I went 
to was, I think there were two people there, and

12:47.962 --> 12:56.791
they were both wondering why they were there, and I 
think Bob Mitchell was one of them, as I recall.

12:56.811 --> 13:01.495
Maybe John Greer was the other one, but it was 
pretty discouraging. At any rate, when I left and

13:02.516 --> 13:10.884
went to Berkeley, that was a very stimulating 
experience. I was there during the middle of the

13:10.904 --> 13:15.589
free speech movement, and I went down to the to the 
commons and watch Mario Savio. And I like to pride

13:19.622 --> 13:31.535
myself in having the intelligence to be standing 
in front of the administration building the day

13:19.622 --> 13:31.535
that Carol Doda came out and did her famous act on 
the balcony of the administration building.

13:34.358 --> 13:36.300
But the students were stimulating. The 
environment was stimulating. Although I did,

13:38.963 --> 13:43.348
just as a quick aside, as I said earlier, find 
myself at Berkeley in the same situation I found

13:43.767 --> 13:58.627
myself in the U.S. and Pennsylvania a few years 
earlier, right in the middle of a fight for turf

13:43.767 --> 13:58.627
between the social policy planners and the fiscal 
planners. So there was nothing dull about it.

14:01.210 --> 14:07.719
Again, as we had at Penn when I was there, we had a 
real galaxy of people, and they made a big

14:01.210 --> 14:07.719
impression on me. However, when I came back, I must 
have come back infused with a lot of energy and

14:14.125 --> 14:18.070
enthusiasm and so forth. And let me say also 
parenthetically that I have never held a position

14:18.190 --> 14:24.579
in a public agency. I've never worked directly for 
a public agency as an employee. When I came back, we

14:29.225 --> 14:33.371
did a lot of work for agencies when I was with 
Marvin. And I had a lot of dealings with public

14:33.391 --> 14:35.854
agencies. And I was around enough so that 
sometimes, particularly in a place like

14:35.874 --> 14:42.143
Galveston, I wondered if I was on their payroll or 
on Marvin's payroll. And he wondered that

14:42.163 --> 14:43.845
sometimes, too. But, so my perspective is more 
from that of an outsider who's done a lot of work

14:44.213 --> 14:52.785
with public agencies but never within public 
agencies. And when I came back, I took a position

14:52.865 --> 14:58.112
with a firm, local firm in Dallas. At that time it 
was called Harrell and Hamilton. It's now called

15:01.456 --> 15:03.499
Omnicwine. Was that Harrell Hamilton? No, no, no.

15:10.228 --> 15:11.510
Harrell, George Harrell and E.T. Hamilton. It's 
now changed. While it was there, it changed its

15:13.354 --> 15:15.156
name to Omniclan. And I was in charge of planning 
and urban design for them. And we did a variety of

15:19.320 --> 15:30.411
things, although none of them, with the exception 
of the Dallas Convention Center, do I consider to

15:19.320 --> 15:30.411
have been especially noteworthy. But things that 
I was involved in during that period of time.

15:34.816 --> 15:41.743
However, when I did come back, I really found 
myself thrown into the middle of AIP. AIA

15:42.432 --> 15:45.955
nationally, AIP nationally, AIP locally. Also, 
when I came back, I was asked upon my return by TCU to

15:46.936 --> 15:58.228
start a course on urban design in their urban 
studies program, which I did. I did, and I used to

15:58.248 --> 15:59.489
commute. For about a year, I commuted several 
nights a week after work to TCU to teach that

16:00.910 --> 16:10.600
course, and I finally gave it up after a year 
because I knew it was just too hard. I just couldn't

16:10.660 --> 16:11.781
do it. and didn't want to do it, I should put it that 
way, because there were a lot of demands on time

16:12.301 --> 16:18.028
otherwise. Is that an animal? What? TCU in Fort 
Worth. In Fort Worth. But it was a long drive after a

16:23.255 --> 16:25.638
day's work. But I did set that program up for them, 
and I understand it did continue for a few years

16:27.140 --> 16:34.950
after that, other people teaching it. When I got 
back, I did get very much involved at a, local

16:39.284 --> 16:42.607
level, at state level, and national level in AIP. 
And I got involved at a local level, not so much at

16:43.308 --> 16:49.073
the state level, but at a national level in AIA. I 
became section director of the,

16:51.615 --> 17:01.303
it was called the Dallas-Fort Worth section 
originally, as I recall. And one of the things, I

17:02.044 --> 17:03.866
did a couple of things. One of them was I got the name 
change to North Central Texas section. The other

17:08.360 --> 17:21.438
thing I did was to, I realized soon after I got into 
the organization, it was one of the reasons why I

17:08.360 --> 17:21.438
wanted to become section director, there were no 
bylaws. And one reason why there were no bylaws is

17:22.520 --> 17:25.664
that the chapter had no bylaws. So I wrote the 
original bylaws myself. I wrote them for the North

17:29.489 --> 17:33.675
Central Texas section. Those bylaws, because 
they were the only ones that existed among all the

17:34.415 --> 17:47.113
sections of the chapter, for that matter, ended up 
being the ones that were used as a model to

17:34.415 --> 17:47.113
construct the first chapter bylaws.

17:50.518 --> 17:54.184
So then we started working on trying to execute. By 
that time, more climbers were coming into Texas.

17:57.048 --> 18:02.616
The 701 programs were dissipating, winding down. 
Towns were growing to a size where they could

18:02.765 --> 18:05.888
afford to hire planners. The population growth in 
Texas had gotten to that point.

18:11.274 --> 18:16.140
The whole thing was getting better in terms of an 
environment. However, there was a lot of friction

18:16.160 --> 18:23.448
between the planners and the engineers, for 
example. And not at that time to a great extent with

18:24.709 --> 18:31.877
the architects, but with the engineers with 
respect to who was going to do planning. And he was

18:32.279 --> 18:34.623
qualified to do planning. And that was a major 
issue at the time. I think Mary Lou Henry was

18:37.146 --> 18:42.494
involved in that situation with the engineers. 
Yes, she was. And I was involved in it to some

18:43.576 --> 18:45.178
extent. One of the things I was involved with also 
at that period of time was helping to get the state

18:47.282 --> 19:01.543
AIP in a stronger position with respect to state 
legislation affecting planners, planning and

18:47.282 --> 19:01.543
planners. with respect to the way in which the 
state viewed the role of cities, municipalities,

19:02.114 --> 19:26.463
in having some responsibility toward planning, 
which at that time they didn't, you know, the old

19:02.114 --> 19:26.463
thing, the old problem of zoning as a substitute 
for planning was rampant in Texas as it is still

19:02.114 --> 19:26.463
largely today.

19:27.624 --> 19:31.429
During, in the, around the mid-60s, or just after I 
got back, around 67, 68, 69, in that period, I was

19:31.797 --> 19:41.369
involved with, well, I was involved with AIP. I was 
chairman for three years of the national, AIP

19:41.689 --> 19:48.318
National Urban Design Committee. We had lots of 
real luminaries on that committee, and I was

19:48.538 --> 19:54.986
fortunate to be able to get them to come to 
meetings. We had about six meetings a year, and I

19:55.026 --> 19:59.752
could get about a 95% participation. They paid 
their own way. from real, really first-class,

20:01.362 --> 20:20.942
well-known people, because by that time, urban 
design was becoming a topic which was widely

20:01.362 --> 20:20.942
discussed and written about, and people were 
interested in pushing it along who were involved

20:01.362 --> 20:20.942
in it. Of course, you had local here. You had 
Wyoming Lou. Well, that was later. That was later.

20:25.907 --> 20:30.272
That came later, and I'll tell that story about how 
we got Waymang, too, if you'd like to know that.

20:30.691 --> 20:32.013
because it's all tied in together. I

20:32.914 --> 20:40.764
was also the one that got finally, I said, this is 
nuts. When the AIP started establishing

20:40.784 --> 20:46.691
technical departments, I said, let's convert 
this to a technical department. And I went to the

20:46.711 --> 20:50.336
board and said, we want to convert this to a 
technical department. And they said they had two,

20:50.356 --> 20:53.399
I think, at that time. One might have been regional 
planning, but I can't remember at this point. They

20:58.966 --> 20:59.567
said, well, We just barely got the other two 
established with enough petition signatures.

21:04.419 --> 21:09.645
And you'll never get urban design to be 
established as technical department. There's

21:09.665 --> 21:10.707
not enough interest. But at any rate, we went ahead 
and promoted it and petitioned it. And when we

21:14.091 --> 21:22.922
submitted it to the board, and I remember that day I 
took it in there, and Paul Davidoff almost fell out

21:14.091 --> 21:22.922
of his chair and was on the board at that time. 
Because I said, well, we've done it, and we have

21:22.942 --> 21:26.567
twice as many signatures we need to petition this 
into a technical department, and considerably

21:27.037 --> 21:32.284
more than the other two. So that got accomplished. 
I was also involved. I can't remember exactly when

21:38.291 --> 21:52.069
it happened, but I was involved in promoting the 
idea of the urban joint program between AIP and

21:38.291 --> 21:52.069
AIA, Urban Design Assistance Team. And I think I 
went on the third one, Second or third one they did,

21:57.361 --> 22:00.725
which was in Linden, Massachusetts. And I worked a 
great deal in trying to get that program and knit it

22:01.906 --> 22:09.534
together and keeping it going between the two 
parties. It's mostly architecture now, isn't it?

22:12.517 --> 22:12.937
I don't know. I've been so out of touch with it for so 
long. Let me say, it was originally conceived by

22:15.240 --> 22:18.924
the AIA. And I, along with a few other people, were 
the ones who pushed the AIP into it and sort of

22:22.825 --> 22:28.411
insisted that it be a joint program. So I'm sure 
that's continued. Well, I'm sure it hadn't

22:31.454 --> 22:37.641
continued, particularly since we changed to the 
APA concept. I don't think there's been enough,

22:37.661 --> 22:40.924
which I was not in favor of. There's not enough glue 
there to make it stick. At any rate, you asked about

22:47.351 --> 22:50.875
Wei Ming Wu. Interesting, I'll tell you the story 
about that, the history of that, if you want to know

22:52.053 --> 22:57.241
how he got here. From Minneapolis, where he was 
from. Yeah, he came from Minneapolis, where he was

22:59.644 --> 23:01.828
from. One of the things that happened when I came 
back from Berkeley is I looked around and I said,

23:01.848 --> 23:07.556
hey, there's no urban design. The city of Dallas 
has no urban design, anything. And they barely had

23:10.882 --> 23:13.606
a comprehensive planning program. So Alden Deal 
was the planning director at that time. How do you

23:17.431 --> 23:18.914
spell his last name? D-E-Y-O. He worked under 
Marvin, and he was the planning director. And

23:24.568 --> 23:30.957
Alden had a very, in my opinion, and I used to tell 
him this, fairly narrow idea of what

23:24.568 --> 23:30.957
comprehensive planning was. And Alden and I spent 
a lot of time talking about urban design and why

23:31.678 --> 23:39.569
urban design should be in the program. After about 
a year and a half, it happened that there was a

23:40.029 --> 23:50.123
reorganization of the planning department, 
which Alden initiated. And we managed to get urban

23:50.744 --> 23:53.326
design. I managed to convince him that urban 
design should be a confluent. Originally, it was

23:57.090 --> 24:07.800
going to be a committee or sort of like a minor 
function within the long range planning aspect of

23:57.090 --> 24:07.800
the plan. And I argued with him and then later, a 
little bit later, with Jim Schroeder, who was very

24:08.260 --> 24:20.211
sympathetic, and with George Schroeder, who was 
the city manager at that time, that it should be a

24:08.260 --> 24:20.211
full-fledged division. Was it Schroeder who was a 
landscape architect? He may have been. I don't

24:25.963 --> 24:27.405
know Jim's background. From A&M. He could have 
been. I don't know Jim's background. At any rate,

24:32.292 --> 24:34.715
we got it established on paper. And then I said, oh, 
my God, it's on paper, but they don't have a staff.

24:38.781 --> 24:40.423
How are they going to get a staff? Because there 
weren't very many people around, and they

24:40.443 --> 24:45.891
wouldn't want to pay very much money at that 
initial and so forth. So one day I went down to...

24:47.562 --> 24:51.087
George, I mean, to Jim Schroeder's office, and I 
said, Jim, I got an idea. He said, what is it? I said,

24:52.810 --> 25:01.142
look, you've got an urban design division 
established on paper, but you don't have it

24:52.810 --> 25:01.142
staffed, and you don't have really enough funds to 
staff it right now. If we don't do something with

25:02.083 --> 25:05.829
it, it's going to die. It's going to just wither, 
and it won't be there anymore, or it'll be lost in

25:05.849 --> 25:14.281
the shop, or it'll be relegated back to what it 
shouldn't have been in the first place. He said,

25:14.301 --> 25:15.363
what do you propose? And I said, well, What I think 
we should do is set up a temporary committee or

25:16.334 --> 25:36.145
preferably a task force, because I see it having a 
short life, to help advise the planning

25:16.334 --> 25:36.145
department during this period on urban design and 
to help it find the person to head up the department

25:16.334 --> 25:36.145
for this division, I should say. He says, find with 
me if you can get George Schrader to agree with it.

25:39.169 --> 25:42.074
So I said, let me have your phone, and I called 
George Schrader upstairs. He was assistant city

25:42.194 --> 25:44.097
manager at that time. I said, I'd like to come up and 
talk to you. He said, fine. So I went up and I made a

25:47.412 --> 25:49.835
proposal to him. He said, I think that's a great 
idea. How do you think we should do it? And I said,

25:53.200 --> 26:04.396
well, it seems to me that you really need to ask one 
of the professional organizations to set it up

25:53.200 --> 26:04.396
rather than trying to do it yourself. Because I 
said two things. That's one. Second thing is it

26:07.520 --> 26:12.287
should report to the city manager, not to the 
planning department. It should be an advisory

26:12.307 --> 26:13.729
group. Because among other things, it needs to 
have independence. And number two, you need to be

26:17.241 --> 26:20.184
able to kick it out when the time comes. So he said, 
OK, who do you suggest? I said, well, I'd like to

26:24.248 --> 26:30.676
suggest AIP, but they're not strong enough to do it 
at this point. I said, so I think what should happen

26:31.296 --> 26:43.530
is you should ask AIA to do it, just strong enough to 
do it, but with some conditions that AIP and ASLA

26:31.296 --> 26:43.530
need to be involved in it directly. put together 
the committee. So that letter was issued, written

26:45.769 --> 27:03.169
by George Schroeder and signed by Scott McDonald, 
the city manager at that time, inviting the AIA to

26:45.769 --> 27:03.169
set up this new function, which I suggested to 
George be called the Urban Design Task Force. And

27:03.189 --> 27:06.293
it did come into existence. I am dismayed to say 
it's still in existence. It should have gone out of

27:08.916 --> 27:10.938
existence a long time ago. It's now become... a 
professional country club, one of those things

27:12.535 --> 27:17.422
you need to have your name on. At any rate, we then 
set about finding somebody to head up this thing,

27:19.044 --> 27:42.255
and we were asked to talk to different people, and 
it happened that along about this time there was a

27:19.044 --> 27:42.255
national AIP conference, a convention in 
Minneapolis, and Jim Schroeder asked me along

27:42.725 --> 28:03.084
with a couple of other people, while we were out 
there to talk with Wei Ming Wu, who was being

27:42.725 --> 28:03.084
considered, and see if we felt he would be a good 
person to employ as the head of the urban design

27:42.725 --> 28:03.084
division, and if so, to help the city convince him 
that he should come here. And we did, in fact, meet

28:03.845 --> 28:09.070
with Wei Ming, and we did, in fact... do a lot of 
talking with him. And I think Wayming has said on a

28:11.462 --> 28:22.560
number of occasions that one of the main reasons he 
made the decision to come was because the city did

28:11.462 --> 28:22.560
have the Urban Design Task Force. And he was 
impressed with the amount of support it had. And he

28:24.944 --> 28:31.695
felt that he could get the support out of the 
community and the professional organizations to

28:24.944 --> 28:31.695
allow him to do the job. So that's the story of how 
Wayming Lou got to Dallas. And he was here for quite

28:37.197 --> 28:40.020
a few years. About six or eight years, and he was...

28:45.746 --> 29:05.787
The blunt truth of the matter is that he was pushed 
out by George Schrader, the city manager,

28:45.746 --> 29:05.787
because, well, there are several sides to the 
story, and I won't go into all that, but I will say

28:45.746 --> 29:05.787
that George and the city council, as a matter of 
fact, at that time, simply were not in sympathy

28:45.746 --> 29:05.787
with what Wayman was trying to accomplish. I think 
there was also a test of wills there and some other

29:06.374 --> 29:22.535
things, but the long and the short of it is that the 
city manager had the power to make conditions in

29:06.374 --> 29:22.535
Dallas untenable for Wei Ming to remain. So he 
left. And now went to the lower town, head up the

29:24.658 --> 29:32.748
lower town redevelopment program in St. Paul and 
was doing a bang-up job there, something I knew he

29:24.658 --> 29:32.748
would do. Wei Ming had quite an influence, I think, 
not only on the on Dallas planning. He certainly

29:37.635 --> 29:44.202
had an influence on with regard to raising 
expectations of what could actually be

29:37.635 --> 29:44.202
accomplished in public environments. But he 
also, I think, raised those level of expectations

29:45.944 --> 29:53.032
in the state because he was truly a national 
figure. And I think people in the profession

29:53.212 --> 29:57.036
recognize that. Well, it seemed to me that I read in 
one of the that at the time, the city of Dallas had

30:01.471 --> 30:11.963
the largest number of dollars budgeted for urban 
design of any city in the United States. I'm sure

30:12.845 --> 30:14.466
that, well, I'm not sure. I'll take that as based 
value being true. It's certainly possible,

30:17.050 --> 30:28.423
because it was a very large budget, and Wei Ming had 
brought a cadre of very skilled people in there,

30:17.050 --> 30:28.423
and they were doing very good things. And it 
certainly was a model for the rest of the state, at

30:29.028 --> 30:32.913
least. Yeah. And I think in some respects, I think 
it still is. I do not know, because I have not been

30:36.438 --> 30:51.417
involved with planning education at all in Texas 
since my commute to TCU back in 67, I guess it was, or

30:36.438 --> 30:51.417
whatever that year I was there. Did you know Tom ? 
Yes, I knew. Tom was a student of mine at NM. And he

30:57.310 --> 30:59.392
has recently set up his own shop. I had heard that. 
But he was with the department for years, and I

31:02.575 --> 31:09.603
think always remained very interested in urban 
design. I'm sure he was very supportive of leaving

31:09.643 --> 31:12.826
the room. Oh, I know he was. Yeah, I know that's a 
fact. In 1969, I really left professional life,

31:17.951 --> 31:26.440
and have not gone back. and went into business.
