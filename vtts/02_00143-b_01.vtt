WEBVTT

00:02.258 --> 00:06.465
Style, manner, physically. As someone who wanted 
to get from point A to point B in the shortest time

00:08.328 --> 00:15.139
and got there. He did not tolerate foolishness. 
Spoke with great conviction.

00:25.936 --> 00:29.582
And I suspect that at times he was less certain than 
he appeared to be. But again, I think one of the

00:34.390 --> 00:45.304
things that was very good about Earl Rudder was 
that even though he was not an academician, he knew

00:34.390 --> 00:45.304
what a good university was about. And I think that 
he diligently saw people who could move A&M from

00:45.324 --> 00:52.413
where it was to where it needed to be. At that time, 
we just had a lot of strong administrators. Talk

00:58.681 --> 01:00.683
about Frank Hubert. Fred Benson was very strong. 
Again, time sort of faded, but agriculture was

01:07.510 --> 01:16.422
always strong with John Hutchison. So just across 
the board A&M was staffed by very strong

01:16.442 --> 01:21.528
administrators. Do you know of any individual or 
individuals that were part of the A&M campus that

01:28.861 --> 01:35.550
were particularly

01:28.861 --> 01:35.550
influential with Mr. Ruddell? I think Fred 
Benson. I had an opportunity to sit on the

01:38.494 --> 01:50.329
Executive Committee for a while, and Fred Benson 
was the one who was most likely to openly differ

01:38.494 --> 01:50.329
with Earl Ruddell. And Earl Rutter always seemed 
to respect Fred Benson's opinion and his

01:50.933 --> 02:00.603
guidance.

02:01.664 --> 02:11.434
So I think he was the one who impressed me most of the 
time that I saw him, as far as being able to speak

02:01.664 --> 02:11.434
very directly with Earl Rutter. Q Can you think of 
any important issues or decisions during Mr.

02:11.454 --> 02:20.603
Rutter's era that in second thought if we had it to 
do over again, we would have done it differently?

02:27.267 --> 02:29.570
Can you think of any decision that? Well, the one 
that I think that I would like to have seen done

02:30.992 --> 02:36.661
differently. I may be the lone ranger. But with 
ANM's

02:39.406 --> 02:48.700
widespread system office that we have now in the 
university, I thought one of the mistakes that was

02:49.490 --> 02:57.559
probably made at the time was the giving up of UT 
Arlington. What's now UT Arlington was Arlington

02:57.639 --> 03:00.443
State College. It was an engineering-oriented 
university in the Metroplex. And I've been told

03:07.150 --> 03:12.797
that there may have been a lot of pressure from UT to 
get that. My feeling at the time was that the

03:13.790 --> 03:24.589
faculty up there did not believe that A&M paid as 
much attention to UT Arlington as it deserved and

03:13.790 --> 03:24.589
that may or may not have been the case. But I think 
A&M lost a real opportunity to have a major

03:25.951 --> 03:33.604
presence in the metroplex. And that could be so 
significant today for many, many reasons. I think

03:38.221 --> 03:38.782
so. Again, there were others that were obviously 
value judgments, one that's much less important

03:39.323 --> 03:47.995
on the large scale. But I thought the junction was 
something that was very unusual, if not unique,

03:49.257 --> 03:56.607
that A&M had to offer. And again, it appeared to me 
that junction was given up to Texas Tech with

04:00.314 --> 04:08.787
little reluctance and no resistance.

04:08.807 --> 04:24.792
One of the things that, again, I thought was 
interesting, and I think there were some obvious

04:08.807 --> 04:24.792
reasons why, but at least my understanding was 
that when they got UT Galveston, they had an

04:08.807 --> 04:24.792
opportunity to have a presence of Corpus Christi 
at the same time. And I think that was a very

04:24.812 --> 04:29.038
important decision. What will prove to be best may 
still be in the future. Were you aware that Mr.

04:35.562 --> 04:41.128
Rutter's health was declining before he became 
ill? I was aware that he had gained a lot of weight.

04:44.832 --> 04:58.587
It didn't appear his color was as good as it might 
be, but that was a very demanding job, physically,

04:44.832 --> 04:58.587
emotionally.

04:58.988 --> 05:08.059
I suspected then and found out later as I was moving 
into so-called upper level administration that

04:58.988 --> 05:08.059
you get invited to a lot of meals. For a lot of us it's 
hard to pass up that dessert, and we probably

05:09.521 --> 05:19.613
should, but I know that there were a lot of people 
who really believed that having a combined

05:19.812 --> 05:31.447
present university and present system in one 
person was more than should be expected of any one

05:19.812 --> 05:31.447
human being. Because it was very, very 
pressure-packed and very demanding. But don't I

05:35.913 --> 05:49.431
recall that he, sometimes as president, was not in 
agreement with the system leadership and that he

05:35.913 --> 05:49.431
liked getting it all under his... Oh, absolutely. 
Absolutely. And this is not quite a sequence, but I

05:55.963 --> 06:04.295
remember, again, going back to the cell study and 
my visiting with Jack Williams. One of the first

06:05.657 --> 06:19.536
questions I asked him, because of the strong 
feeling people had about a combined job for one

06:05.657 --> 06:19.536
person being a killer, I asked Jack Williams what 
his thoughts were. about having two separate

06:19.786 --> 06:24.093
offices. And he was adamant that it should be one. 
And I remember him telling me that there was only

06:29.981 --> 06:46.266
one thing that he knew of that worked, and that is in 
the Navy, that if you had an admiral of fleet aboard

06:29.981 --> 06:46.266
a ship, there was never any question that the 
captain of the ship ran the ship. Admiral had

06:47.579 --> 06:50.723
nothing to do with the operation of the ship. He 
said anytime you have the system offices on the

06:50.743 --> 07:02.496
campus of the flagship university, you've got 
problems because you've got end runs that are

06:50.743 --> 07:02.496
being constantly made. And in essence, he 
wouldn't tolerate the idea of having the jobs

07:02.516 --> 07:07.462
separated. So there were obvious reasons as to why 
the CEO wanted to have control of the the system as

07:16.705 --> 07:29.604
well as the university because there is so much 
interaction between and among the agencies that

07:16.705 --> 07:29.604
it certainly makes the line of authority much 
clearer. So do you remember any moment when you

07:29.744 --> 07:36.554
heard that Mr. Rutter was seriously ill or had 
died? I remember it because I thought it was a

07:38.617 --> 07:42.322
catastrophic time for A&M. I don't remember the 
specific moments. When John Kennedy was shot, I

07:47.570 --> 08:00.794
remember walking out on the third floor of a 
G-Roller flight and hearing what I thought was a

07:47.570 --> 08:00.794
bad joke and finding out it was not. It was just bad. 
Let's do that just a second. And what did you, what

08:04.381 --> 08:10.692
followed that, what did you do when you heard that 
that was the truth? I went back to my office and got a

08:11.482 --> 08:21.696
radio and started listening to all the news 
reports that I could

08:11.482 --> 08:21.696
get. And like I said, I remember most vividly that I 
was playing badminton at night. And walked out,

08:27.503 --> 08:33.511
and this was about deer season time, and I thought 
this is one of those really sick jokes. And then of

08:34.232 --> 08:39.379
course had the decision to make about bonfire and 
some other things. So it was a, as a native

08:40.692 --> 09:03.825
Dallasite, I was very defensive about Dallas 
being branded as that radical, and I still remain

08:40.692 --> 09:03.825
somewhat bitter about people branding the whole 
city for something that someone who was not even a

08:40.692 --> 09:03.825
resident of the city doing. And you knew all of the 
locations. All of the locations. You knew where

09:08.032 --> 09:09.754
those were. With Mr. Rutter, we then had an interim 
president. Al Ludeke. Al Ludeke.

09:20.856 --> 09:23.780
And then Williams was selected. How did you hear, 
do you remember anything that you heard? Were you

09:28.307 --> 09:30.410
aware of a search process or anything? I was aware 
of a search process. And I had heard a little bit

09:33.315 --> 09:37.902
that Jack Williams was a strong candidate. But I 
would like to say just a few words. I had a lot of

09:41.960 --> 09:43.822
admiration for Al Lutie. Oh, please, yes, yes. I 
thought he came into a very, very awkward

09:46.546 --> 09:50.651
situation. He and Earl Rutter were classmates, as 
I understand it, from the same general part of

09:50.671 --> 09:58.340
Texas.

09:59.602 --> 10:07.872
Same type of military record, in that they were 
both generals, not the combat record.

10:09.286 --> 10:18.399
There was a lot of suspicion among the faculty 
about, you know, here's another class of 32 from

10:09.286 --> 10:18.399
West Texas in general.

10:19.620 --> 10:26.931
And again, Al Ludeke was someone who was not a 
dynamic speaker. I think he realized that, and so I

10:27.672 --> 10:37.345
think he viewed his public addresses as a chore to 
be endured. And he spoke very succinctly, and had a

10:38.986 --> 10:43.071
lot of thought in what he said. So he was one of those 
who would stand up, speak up, and shut up. And I

10:48.417 --> 10:51.541
think a lot of people admired that. And I think that 
he gained a lot of respect from a lot of backers

10:53.263 --> 11:01.332
pretty quickly. And then when Jack Williams came 
in, Al Ludigant worked with the system planning

11:02.257 --> 11:13.292
and did a very good job with that as well. So for a 
transition president, I thought A&M could not

11:14.714 --> 11:20.942
have made a better choice than they did. And then I 
think Jack Williams was, by my definition, the

11:22.605 --> 11:30.255
second man for his time at A&M.

11:31.400 --> 11:41.419
He took A&M from the point that Earl Rudder had 
brought it to make it really a pretty

11:31.400 --> 11:41.419
comprehensive university. You're back as, at 
this point, you're back as the associate? No, I'm

11:46.489 --> 11:51.518
now in the Vice President's office.

11:52.139 --> 11:57.365
One of the recommendations that came out of the 
cell study was to have an office of planning. And so

11:57.385 --> 12:00.849
that became a major factor. Charlie Bunnell had 
done some work in the general area before I got

12:00.889 --> 12:04.294
there. But worked with planning and then became an 
associate vice president.

12:15.247 --> 12:17.269
How did that search process I don't know if there 
was a certain process. Who contacted you? John

12:23.013 --> 12:23.493
Calhoun. Describe Calhoun and his style.

12:31.885 --> 12:40.657
It sounds like I'm polishing the apple, but 
there's so many that I just have a lot of admiration

12:31.885 --> 12:40.657
for, and John Calhoun is certainly in that 
category. I'll tell you one other aside. My first

12:43.422 --> 12:52.751
wife, Joyce, had been part-time secretary in John 
Calhoun's office when he was in the system office.

12:52.771 --> 13:02.520
And one of the things, she always liked him a lot, 
but one of the stories she told me that just really

12:52.771 --> 13:02.520
amazed her was that someone asked him for a list of 
the top five people in the serving field. And the

13:03.761 --> 13:12.349
first one he put on the list was John C. Calhoun Jr. 
And Joyce said, you know, it wasn't, he was

13:03.761 --> 13:12.349
bragging. He would just ask to rank them, and he was 
in the top five. And most of us are not that

13:18.179 --> 13:24.327
self-assured that we can do that.

13:26.009 --> 13:34.458
But he's very bright, and I think he has a good sense 
of humor that is not evident to everyone. For the

13:34.478 --> 13:37.542
people who are around him, he's jovial. He's 
outgoing. And one of the things that, again, is of

13:42.383 --> 13:53.303
no consequence, but I enjoyed it at least, was that 
there was a very rapid turnover of the secretarial

13:42.383 --> 13:53.303
staff in the Vice President's office. Oftentimes 
he'd just refer to someone in the politically, now

13:53.323 --> 14:01.759
politically incorrect way of saying, the new 
girl. At one point, someone made up a little desk

14:02.870 --> 14:08.596
sign and said, the new girl. Put that as a name plate 
on the girl. Then they wound up with the newest

14:11.159 --> 14:14.722
girl.

14:16.544 --> 14:25.273
But John Calhoun, again, is one of those who can 
give you authority and responsibility. And I

14:25.293 --> 14:28.236
think you learn quickly. that you better be very 
careful what you suggest, because it may come to

14:28.823 --> 14:34.208
pass. And if you haven't thought it through pretty 
carefully, it's not going to go over well with

14:34.228 --> 14:39.393
anybody. And so I think if I'm going to say 
something to him, I better be pretty sure of what

14:39.413 --> 14:47.001
I'm going to say.

14:48.602 --> 14:51.605
John Calhoun has a lot of thoughts, and I'll jump 
way back. But Frank Hubert has a truly creative

14:51.886 --> 14:58.392
mind. And I'll come back to John Kelly, but one 
story that I'd like to get on the record.

15:04.820 --> 15:18.319
On the Harrington Building, in the classroom 
portion, Frank Hubert spent a lot of time thinking

15:04.820 --> 15:18.319
about a truly technologically advanced series of 
classrooms. And some of the things that he thought

15:18.339 --> 15:25.189
were so good in theory, but didn't work well in 
practice.

15:27.363 --> 15:30.888
The Harrington classroom building was designed 
that people would enter at the back of the room. And

15:32.270 --> 15:42.543
then the flow would be out the front of the room so 
that when fairly large classes changed, there'd

15:32.270 --> 15:42.543
just be some going out, there'd be some coming in, 
and there'd be no conflict in the traffic. But the

15:43.685 --> 15:45.107
people didn't go out the front. So there was a lot of 
contact between the students going out the way

15:45.908 --> 15:52.877
they were not supposed to. It was sort of like going 
up the down staircase. But he had about everything

15:55.848 --> 16:02.254
that was available at that time in the classrooms. 
And the console looked like a console on a 747. It

16:08.060 --> 16:10.222
intimidated a lot of the faculty members. But one 
of the things that Frank Hubert was set on was there

16:10.242 --> 16:19.231
would not be any overhead projectors in the 
Harrington classroom buildings. But we had to go

16:19.251 --> 16:24.876
back later and add those because the faculty 
members weren't quite as progressive as Frank

16:19.251 --> 16:24.876
Hubert was. But he had one classroom, classroom 
100, where he had a telegraphic set up in there and

16:25.632 --> 16:46.695
it was designed so that the teacher could test as he 
was lecturing and the students could plug in the

16:25.632 --> 16:46.695
numbers and then in the back of the room he had a 
printout of how many students got the correct

16:25.632 --> 16:46.695
answer and all that. So he was always very much on 
the cutting edge, and Frank Hubert was the prime

16:47.350 --> 17:06.576
mover, as far as I know, for the development of KAMU 
television, which is still, I think, probably the

16:47.350 --> 17:06.576
smallest

16:47.350 --> 17:06.576
public television station in the country. Now, 
and do you happen to know when KAMU came on stream?

17:11.863 --> 17:14.607
Well, it started out over in Bagley Hall. Was it, 
was it in the Rudder days or the Williams? Rudders,

17:17.416 --> 17:19.799
Rudder days. Because in that old, you know, 
remember back in the old red brick building? That

17:24.986 --> 17:26.387
was pretty bad. But anyway, John Calhoun, you 
know, is obviously an engineer and a scientist.

17:36.160 --> 17:40.425
And I think he did a lot and he and, he and Jack 
Williams I thought were almost ideal co-leaders

17:41.148 --> 17:56.369
of the university, with Jack William with his 
history background and his more liberal arts type

17:41.148 --> 17:56.369
orientation, and John Calvin with his science and 
engineering. And it was obvious to me, at least,

17:56.389 --> 18:00.094
that they had a lot of respect for each other.

18:03.038 --> 18:05.181
Can you think of any strong disagreement Not that I 
know of. I never did. Were you, did Williams by

18:11.311 --> 18:18.580
chance chat with you or anybody you know before he 
selected Calhoun? No, not with me. But you know,

18:23.807 --> 18:27.912
again, if you think about the establishment of the 
College of Medicine,

18:30.035 --> 18:37.945
I think the Nautical Archaeology program, 
Institute of Nautical Archaeology was a real,

18:30.035 --> 18:37.945
real find for A&M. We've gotten a lot of very 
positive public relations after that. The Center

18:42.751 --> 18:47.097
for Tectonal Physics, I think John Calhoun was 
probably a major player in that.

18:50.381 --> 18:56.509
So, and those were the things that built for a lot of 
our offshore technology. The deep sea drilling

18:56.529 --> 18:58.692
program. When you came over, yeah, everything was 
in T. Right. You and Dick Winerdi. Let's talk about

19:08.899 --> 19:13.506
Winerdi and his role. Winerdi had been, I think, 
one of John Calhoun's graduate students. Again,

19:17.412 --> 19:23.481
very bright, very creative thought process.

19:26.093 --> 19:33.704
One thing I probably shouldn't say, but I enjoyed 
it, was one time Dick had this great revelation

19:26.093 --> 19:33.704
that what we needed was a war room. And that every 
bit of information that did exist in the

19:35.346 --> 19:40.794
university should exist and be available in this 
war room. And then whatever we needed to do. Hi

19:45.440 --> 19:45.620
there. Would you like a little light? I can give you 
light. But anyway, he met with some of us about

19:49.600 --> 20:03.246
doing all this, and Mel LaSalle and some others, 
because we had a lot of information, a lot more than

19:49.600 --> 20:03.246
most universities, I think, at that point in time. 
One person who I had very little to do with, but I

20:03.266 --> 20:07.174
think was influential, was Andy Suttle. The idea 
never had much to do with him. But anyway, I

20:11.217 --> 20:24.654
remember telling Dick that the one thing I did 
understand about data is that someone has to input

20:11.217 --> 20:24.654
it, and someone has to be able to access it, and 
someone has to order it in a way that's meaningful.

20:24.674 --> 20:30.622
And that what he was proposing to do would be 
absolutely wonderful to have, but it would be an

20:24.674 --> 20:30.622
overwhelming task. But Dick,

20:32.644 --> 20:37.731
high energy. like I said, innovative thought 
process.

20:44.996 --> 20:54.549
May not be correct, but I didn't have the feeling 
that Dick was necessarily the stereotypical

20:44.996 --> 20:54.549
engineering's logical step-by-step process. I 
think he could dream the great dream. He and John

21:00.037 --> 21:06.025
Calhoun seemed to be a good pair and work together. 
Do you remember Calhoun ever losing his temper?

21:10.887 --> 21:13.209
Mr. No, I really don't. But one of the things that, 
again, I think is important from my point of view,

21:13.670 --> 21:39.173
when there would be pretty serious disagreement 
between John Calhoun and someone else, most often

21:13.670 --> 21:39.173
an administrator, with the resolution, the thing 
that I said is kind of flippantly, but I never

21:13.670 --> 21:39.173
believed there was any hangover heat with John 
Calhoun that that when you were through with one

21:39.929 --> 21:42.913
issue, the next issue started to even up. And there 
are not many people who are capable of doing that.

21:47.819 --> 21:50.683
There are some people who keep their own private 
school book. And I never felt that was true of John

21:51.664 --> 21:59.455
Calvin.

21:59.475 --> 22:02.038
And that if you were reasonably Did

22:02.390 --> 22:15.564
you have any experience with them in the Austin 
side of the job? Not a great deal. But again, I think

22:17.126 --> 22:25.275
John Calhoun was viewed as someone who had a lot of 
integrity. And I think generally across the

22:25.880 --> 22:35.392
board, A&M has had administrators who have been 
viewed to have integrity in dealing with people in

22:25.880 --> 22:35.392
Austin.

22:36.914 --> 22:38.316
And I think that served A&M well. And I think that, 
again, maybe because I want to believe it, but I

22:38.376 --> 22:51.853
think that A&M as an institution

22:38.376 --> 22:51.853
was less likely to confront the coordinating 
board than maybe some other state-assisted

22:52.357 --> 22:57.984
universities did. And I think A&M has probably 
generally been better off for having done that.

23:05.973 --> 23:18.048
When there was a question about whether the 
recording board really had the authority to do it

23:05.973 --> 23:18.048
or not, I think A&M was more likely to go ahead and 
try to play by the rules as they understood them. I

23:18.068 --> 23:19.950
think A&M was better served by that. Uh, were you 
aware during William's last months that he was

23:20.622 --> 23:28.630
becoming physical? Yes. You could see him go down. 
I mean, you could just, you could see him in one

23:31.473 --> 23:39.942
time, two weeks later, he was, he was obviously not 
as robust as he had been. And one of the things that,

23:41.204 --> 23:48.992
uh, that really caught the attention, I don't know 
if you saw it or not, but soon after he died, KMU had a

23:49.833 --> 23:55.722
series of events that Williams had participated 
in. And when he came to A&M, he was so robust. And

23:59.548 --> 24:14.331
then at the end, when they were showing clips, it 
was just dramatic how physically he was declining

23:59.548 --> 24:14.331
in his fitness.

24:14.672 --> 24:15.553
All right.

24:18.672 --> 24:25.660
So who was the interim

24:18.672 --> 24:25.660
president? Well, Clyde Wells was.

24:38.576 --> 24:38.916
Clyde Wells, yes. Let's back up just a little bit. 
Yeah, no. Clyde Wells is the interim, and Williams

24:41.900 --> 24:46.445
goes to the hospital, and McCubbers comes back. 
Right. Okay. We hear rumors about the board going

24:48.676 --> 24:54.442
to recreate the system administration. Yes. Can 
you throw in any light as to what you heard at that

24:56.804 --> 25:06.113
point about what was supposed to happen, going to 
happen, might happen?

25:07.514 --> 25:17.704
Well, I tried to see anything but a little bit, but

25:07.514 --> 25:17.704
there were rumors at least that Clyde Wells would 
like to have that as a I don't know. I do

25:20.599 --> 25:33.775
feel certain that from the faculty's point of 
view, it was good that it did not become a public

25:20.599 --> 25:33.775
question. But then there were questions about 
what would William's role be, who would be. I think

25:41.404 --> 25:45.008
it was pretty well decided they would separate the 
office and have a chancellor of the system and a

25:45.933 --> 25:51.800
president of the university. And I think it was 
pretty well decided that Williams would be the

25:52.841 --> 25:57.906
chancellor for a while. And then he would be the 
president. And then that's when Jarvis became

26:03.092 --> 26:08.578
president, which came as a surprise to Hunter. 
Hun? Jeannie? Would you get Hunter back in there

26:11.819 --> 26:13.201
please? So I

26:15.184 --> 26:35.751
think

26:15.184 --> 26:35.751
there were a lot of us who thought, hoped that John 
Calhoun would be a serious candidate for

26:15.184 --> 26:35.751
president. and Williams was chancellor and that 
would have been in many ways a continuation of what

26:36.305 --> 26:47.535
had been before with less demands on Williams.

26:47.555 --> 26:58.926
And do you remember that first week after the 
choice was made by the board that Calhoun not be and

26:47.555 --> 26:58.926
Jarvis be the president? The thing I remember most 
was Jarvis coming over and talking to Matt

26:58.946 --> 27:03.730
Prescott about being and the vice president for 
active affairs. The question of what my

27:07.871 --> 27:14.861
involvement would be if I would stay or go or 
whatever.

27:17.444 --> 27:29.802
So I think that I guess Jarvis and Mac had known each 
other better than most of us had Jarvis because of

27:17.444 --> 27:29.802
Mac's involvement with teaching. of 
agriculture, even though he was the dean of the

27:30.558 --> 27:36.046
College of Science, so. Were you, did you have much 
interaction with Jarvis before that time? No. I

27:40.572 --> 27:42.975
had not. No. And as my memory fuzzy, that Calhoun 
moves out of the office over the weekend. Yes. And

27:51.146 --> 27:53.350
Jarvis is there Monday morning. Right, with his 
staff. Yeah. And that you and I And Linerdy are

28:00.258 --> 28:06.286
still there, but Linerdy quickly decides that 
he's got to- Do something else. He's got to find

28:06.306 --> 28:07.968
another place. Okay, then

28:09.069 --> 28:20.784
any changes in style with Mack and Jarvis, in 
administrative style? Very much, they were very

28:20.804 --> 28:25.810
different styles from Calvin. And again, not 
being limited by a lot of facts, Jarvis seemed to me

28:27.562 --> 28:39.279
to have very much of the agriculture style of 
leadership.

28:42.704 --> 28:56.404
I think

28:42.704 --> 28:56.404
that they were more politically sensitive to a lot 
of things. than had been the case with Dr. Kelly.

29:02.241 --> 29:14.416
But there are so many interest groups involved in 
agriculture that you have to work with that I'm

29:02.241 --> 29:14.416
sure it's going to influence almost anyone's 
style. Because commodity groups and producers

29:15.557 --> 29:25.429
and all kinds of people believe they deserve a lot 
of your attention. We'd like to have a lot of

29:25.747 --> 29:30.775
involvement in decisions. All right, we move back 
then over to the Koch building. And who are the key

29:36.243 --> 29:41.752
members of Jarvis' office staff? Glenn Dowling 
and Steve Pringle were there. And what were their

29:45.898 --> 29:48.322
duties? Glenn worked, I think, primarily with the 
budget aspect and some personnel things for

29:48.342 --> 29:53.830
Jarvis. Steve seemed to be more involved with the 
political aspects of it. I never really knew

30:01.527 --> 30:08.315
exactly what Steve was directly responsible for. 
And I believe George also brought his own

30:08.335 --> 30:12.380
secretary from agriculture. So he in essence 
brought his own staff. And they obviously had

30:16.044 --> 30:22.551
already developed their own way of doing 
business. And the rest of us had pretty well

30:23.037 --> 30:30.705
developed it, and so it was a transition period to 
try to meld the two styles. And Steve did not stay

30:30.925 --> 30:36.691
very long.

30:36.711 --> 30:41.816
Now, let's stop and look back on the Reuben period. 
Can you think of any missed opportunities?

30:48.803 --> 30:50.985
A lot of new things were done.

30:53.969 --> 30:59.055
I think he seized most of the opportunities. We had 
very rapid growth in graduate programs.

31:07.264 --> 31:17.816
And one of the things that I liked and admired was 
that in many ways we didn't try to become the all

31:07.264 --> 31:17.816
comprehensive university. And I think that's a 
tough thing for people not to want to do. But

31:24.040 --> 31:28.950
basically we said we're going to continue to build 
on our strengths and we're going to try to develop

31:24.040 --> 31:28.950
some new strengths. And graduate education is one 
of the real strengths. Williams had a lot of charm.
