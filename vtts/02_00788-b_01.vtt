WEBVTT

00:03.727 --> 00:06.510
He said, take this plane and fly it straight back to 
Brooks.

00:10.214 --> 00:12.136
And I said, well, I've never flown a plane. He says, 
well, you won't learn any sooner. No instructions

00:17.722 --> 00:19.204
at all. And so he says, get that wing and that 
horizon. And I kept climbing a little bit, or I'd be

00:26.311 --> 00:30.075
going down. I couldn't hold that thing. He says, 
who in there blankety-blank ever told you you

00:32.903 --> 00:37.007
would fly? And after a while, he took over when we 
got pretty close to Brooks. And he throttled the

00:42.633 --> 00:45.436
motor, of course, going down the land. And

00:45.456 --> 00:52.583
we were going over past this tower.

00:55.646 --> 00:59.530
And I saw some of them later. And Bob Williams, who 
later became a major general, he says, Oh, didn't

01:05.118 --> 01:08.201
Breen, did you draw Breen as an indirect? I said, I 
sure did. And I got chewed out this morning. He

01:11.084 --> 01:12.686
said, I heard every word you said. When you're 
coming over that, coming over this barracks and

01:12.766 --> 01:18.952
come down, he said, I happened to be in. And I had 
heard every word he told you. And everybody else,

01:25.659 --> 01:31.925
because he had that deep voice, you know, and he 
always cussed. Well, uh...

01:36.016 --> 01:40.143
They called me down for physical right after that. 
And I went in there, and Captain Hart, who was a

01:41.686 --> 01:56.252
medical examiner, he had been to a special course 
on the heart at Harvard University, a refresher

01:41.686 --> 01:56.252
course.

01:59.067 --> 02:05.794
He caught three of us, one student from Vanderbilt 
and the other one from Georgia Tech and myself. I

02:06.474 --> 02:10.879
was the only Texas, there were 12 of us from Texas 
down there on active duty. We were second

02:11.399 --> 02:12.461
lieutenants.

02:16.605 --> 02:20.669
And all three of us, and they gave us another 
chance. Caught three of you what? With a bad heart.

02:24.032 --> 02:25.153
Oh, with a bad heart. Irregular heart. So he says, 
now, Captain Hart says, come back. And he says,

02:33.068 --> 02:39.416
asked me, he said, you been hedgehogged? Have you 
been on a flight this morning? I said, I sure have.

02:44.103 --> 02:45.545
And he says, who's your instructor? I told him, he 
said, well, you come back for another physical.

02:50.852 --> 02:53.736
I'll give you a break. And he gave me an apartment. 
And I went back again, and same one. He says, I've

03:01.017 --> 03:05.282
had irregular heart evidence all my life. And I 
went, my uncle checked me after I got home. And he

03:12.551 --> 03:14.233
says, I can't find the thing wrong. And I'm. So they 
discharged you? Oh, yeah. I got a discharge. So

03:21.482 --> 03:23.985
they got a medical discharge then from active duty 
in the Army. Yeah, they wanted me to transfer to the

03:24.005 --> 03:26.348
quartermaster. But I had made up my mind if I was 
going to take this active duty, and then I was

03:27.138 --> 03:36.887
coming back to A&M the following semester, the 
following year. And when they wanted to transfer

03:39.229 --> 03:45.775
me to the quartermaster, I said I'd prefer not. So I 
got out. And then you went back to A&M. I came back,

03:51.740 --> 03:56.925
and I've been here ever since. And you decided then 
that you wanted to go into vet school? Yes. I'd made

04:02.930 --> 04:03.931
up my mind. I'd had two courses, one under Dr. 
Francis. As an undergraduate? In anatomy, oh yes,

04:09.337 --> 04:13.242
in veterinary medicine. And then,

04:13.262 --> 04:26.457
and a course under Dr. Ornstein and Dr. Leonard as a 
senior.

04:26.723 --> 04:28.346
made up my mind, I'd like to try it. Did you ever, 
even though you had made up your mind that you

04:29.347 --> 04:42.268
wanted to become a vet, did you ever think of going 
to some other vet school?

04:42.328 --> 04:46.715
No, not at the time, because this probably was the 
cheapest school. Oh, sure. And another thing, I

04:47.897 --> 04:53.406
was a great admirer of Dr. Francis. Well, we're 
going to talk about him in a minute, and so I want to

04:54.044 --> 04:57.970
ask you another question. And that concerns the 
screening process for your entrance into vet

04:58.330 --> 05:03.938
school. Can you tell me how that worked at the time? 
They didn't screen you. When you applied. All you

05:11.990 --> 05:22.785
needed back in those days was, I think, 17 credits 
or something like that from high school to enter as

05:11.990 --> 05:22.785
a freshman in veterinary medicine.

05:23.643 --> 05:29.408
I had this degree and I didn't have any screening 
process like I have now. Yeah. So they were quite

05:31.510 --> 05:34.213
happy to have you as a student. Well, they didn't 
have. I think there were— Sure, there were so few.

05:38.317 --> 05:43.281
In the class of—I finished in January of 26. I was 
the only one at that time. Then they had, I think,

05:46.384 --> 05:50.468
three to finish in May in 26. Jaggie was one of them. 
and J.D. Jones and Paul Bariski, the three

05:55.958 --> 06:00.483
graduates in 26. That is in May. And I took most of my 
work, however, with the class of 25, and then left

06:04.088 --> 06:15.741
off, of course, in clinic so I could come back, and I 
asked Dr. Marstittle if I could do it, and they said

06:04.088 --> 06:15.741
sure. So I left that one course to take, say, and 
take an extra semester. But I worked at the

06:21.558 --> 06:23.201
veterinary hospital. I lived down there and had 
lived down there since 24.

06:33.356 --> 06:36.200
Well, did they help you, fund you somehow? Did they 
give you sort of a work-study situation, or how did

06:36.321 --> 06:41.288
you support yourself? Well, I was getting 25 cents 
an hour like everybody else. I finally got up to, I

06:46.677 --> 06:56.808
think by the time I finished in January of 26, I was 
getting 31 cents an hour. That was pretty good. The

06:59.111 --> 07:11.325
blacks and the others, the laborers, and they 
usually had six or eight or ten of them, they were

06:59.111 --> 07:11.325
getting 33 cents an hour. The one, the Negro who 
took the part. And they were doing construction

07:15.126 --> 07:16.789
around? No, taking care of the dogs or the horses 
and the cattle and the hogs. Hauling mess haul

07:22.377 --> 07:26.864
garbage. They usually had several hundred hogs 
they would feed with mess haul garbage. And ship

07:33.214 --> 07:36.118
them off to a market. I remember a number of cases. I 
was at the hospital with Dr. Marsteller, who was

07:38.082 --> 07:41.667
dean at that time. No, he wasn't dean. Dr. Francis 
was the dean, but he was next in line. He was head of

07:48.939 --> 07:50.742
medicine and surgery. He'd wake us up about 5, 30 in 
the morning. Says, let's go on. Let's get going.

07:58.195 --> 08:01.060
Said, we're going to load those hogs this morning. 
And usually I'd have noticed the night before, but

08:01.080 --> 08:07.350
the day before. But we drove hogs from the old 
hospital right across from where the AG building,

08:09.035 --> 08:16.123
the old AG building is now.

08:19.146 --> 08:22.449
That old hospital, of course, was torn down in 
1933. And then the

08:22.650 --> 08:38.046
barns over here extended out where all they play 
polo and that around that area now.

08:39.882 --> 08:58.506
But we drive them from that hospital up by where it 
is, the old chemistry building, where the

08:39.882 --> 08:58.506
archives building is now, the old Cushing 
Library, right by the academic building. Between

08:58.646 --> 09:06.116
that and the physics building and the civil 
engineering, old civil engineering building at

08:58.646 --> 09:06.116
least. I don't know what they have there now, 
history, I think. and then by Goodwin Hall, and I

09:09.616 --> 09:23.153
hope the Koch Building was not there, but right 
across there, and just get there a little after

09:09.616 --> 09:23.153
daybreak, and of course, pardon me, just before 
Reveille. And you could hear the boys. We had one

09:28.619 --> 09:35.708
old Tom Hill,

09:38.489 --> 09:43.856
would take a sack of corn and lead them, and they'd 
follow him. He'd be throwing corn on the way.

09:49.064 --> 09:51.927
But those hogs, of course, they were fat hogs. They 
would grunt, and the boys would start calling,

09:51.947 --> 10:02.822
suey, suey, right from Goodwin Hall and from 
Foster Hall. But... course I don't think

10:07.244 --> 10:18.521
anybody's living around the Y and I am not sure 
whether they had, I don't believe they had that

10:07.244 --> 10:18.521
tenth cent in it anymore. I don't know where the low 
end per year were in at the time, I don't think so.

10:24.209 --> 10:36.728
But we'd drive them down to the Missouri Pacific 
right across the drill field, parade ground now,

10:24.209 --> 10:36.728
down by where the Across Wellborn Road there? Yes, 
right across that and load them right at the

10:40.388 --> 10:44.254
Missouri Pacific Station. I'd have a car there and 
we'd load them. But I remember doing that several

10:47.860 --> 10:51.145
times. And that's the kind of work that you would do 
for your 25 cents an hour? Well, take care of clinic

10:55.452 --> 11:01.682
horses and cattle, any dogs, anything else they 
had. But it was a wonderful experience. Yeah, I

11:05.007 --> 11:05.668
would think. I think it would be excellent. Where 
did you live? I was there in the hospital right next

11:08.083 --> 11:11.627
to the dog ward. Really? Yes. Did you get much 
sleep? Well, you learn to do with it. Did they put

11:21.275 --> 11:23.717
most of the vet students up? No, I was the only one 
down there. Well, we had one boy, Harvey Ellis,

11:26.480 --> 11:30.664
lived in the other part further away. But I was 
right next to the dog ward and next to the, the Dr.

11:34.724 --> 11:40.532
Marsteller's office, Dr. Leonard's office, at 
the entrance. And every night that owl would come

11:40.692 --> 11:53.149
through here about 12, 20, but before you could 
ever hear the whistle, it would be down around

11:40.692 --> 11:53.149
Weldon. The dogs would start howling. You usually 
have one dog to lead them. And they'd start

11:56.994 --> 11:57.895
howling. Well, you didn't know the owl was coming. 
Another time, 1.30, well, I had probably asleep by

12:03.428 --> 12:04.730
then. And then the morning trains, they'd howl. Of 
course, that's at high note before a person could

12:09.376 --> 12:13.162
hear them. They could detect it. And they'd all 
howl.

12:19.450 --> 12:21.353
So you always knew if the trains were on time. No, 
they didn't wake me up once I got to sleep. Not after

12:25.843 --> 12:26.524
that. I got used to it. You got used to it? Oh, yeah. 
You slept right through that? Yeah. What did you

12:30.688 --> 12:34.872
think of your student colleagues in the vet 
school? I know there were only a few of them, but

12:36.994 --> 12:43.541
what do you think their quality was, or compare 
them to more recent students? Well, some of them

12:44.482 --> 12:50.108
did some, made very good citizens and did good jobs 
when they got out. I don't know. One boy dropped out

12:52.284 --> 12:54.407
as a junior. I don't know what ever happened to 
Robbins. But the rest of them stayed with

12:58.272 --> 13:02.738
veterinary medicine in one form or another. And a 
couple in that class of 25 became quite wealthy,

13:03.619 --> 13:17.479
one from real estate and the other one from 
organizing this company at peanutizing company

13:19.737 --> 13:27.465
at Fort Worth that Bill Anderson bought it from his 
widow. But he used to, that boy used to work at the

13:28.787 --> 13:34.233
horse barn. He was a poor boy, but he became a 
millionaire out of that thing. And so financially

13:40.499 --> 13:48.428
wise, those two boys out of that class of 25 perhaps 
have been very successful, of course.

13:56.572 --> 14:06.826
Winchester from Texarkana

13:56.572 --> 14:06.826
said there were three millionaires in that class 
of 25, and two of them were vet students. And, but I

14:08.368 --> 14:14.115
think he bought the land right there in the age of 
Texarkana. And because

14:20.892 --> 14:25.397
I know that McDonald's was trying to buy some land 
from him. He wouldn't sell to them. He didn't know.

14:29.603 --> 14:31.925
But I don't know what happened. Were they pretty 
good students? Yes, they were pretty good

14:34.348 --> 14:36.951
students. Did you detect any change over the years 
of the quality of the students?

14:44.888 --> 14:53.283
Oh, after we got to screening them, and the first 
class that was screened was the class of 50, 1950.

14:53.503 --> 15:02.639
In fact, when they made, see, we had about a 
quadruple increase about 1932. In fact, we had

15:02.659 --> 15:09.732
only one student in 30, that was Ty Hardy. And two 
students in 28, and I think three in 27, and

15:10.690 --> 15:21.666
four in 20. Let's see, in 22, 21, there were four or 
five. And 23, there were two. 22, there were two.

15:32.923 --> 15:39.432
And

15:32.923 --> 15:39.432
there, several years, only one would graduate. 
But in 32, the student enrollment jumped about

15:40.711 --> 15:52.487
four times many, and then in 38, it jumped again. So 
they made a ruling in about 40, at 39 or 40, that the

15:54.349 --> 16:04.002
enrollment would be limited to 100 students. And 
then in 45 or 46, I'm not positive about the exact

16:06.192 --> 16:13.941
time. Anyway, they made a ruling that each class 
would be screened according to scholarship and

16:14.061 --> 16:24.513
aptitude. Those were the two qualities they were 
putting on there. So that made the class of 50 the

16:29.479 --> 16:33.904
first one that had been screened. And the quality 
was pretty good. But grade point-wise,

16:38.162 --> 16:49.735
I often think these high schools change their 
grading, and some of them from schools that are

16:38.162 --> 16:49.735
more lenient than others. I remember a boy came 
here with a straight A average, and he didn't get

16:51.517 --> 16:57.183
the first base here. I never got into the sophomore 
year. But I think that was aptitude. That was

17:05.451 --> 17:07.233
before they started screening them. So

17:09.335 --> 17:20.926
his brother,

17:09.335 --> 17:20.926
no, his father was a veterinarian. And so he was 
sent. It was mandatory. And he just wasn't

17:24.990 --> 17:29.054
beginning to take to it. No, he wasn't. I didn't 
understand. He was out of pocket. So, but these

17:33.048 --> 17:39.295
students nowadays, their grade point ratio is 
pretty high. They had some masters and PhDs even

17:40.696 --> 17:44.220
have come through. In fact, I've had several PhDs 
that came through.

17:56.233 --> 17:59.136
One happened to be a memorizer. In fact, I went back 
and studied his history at the lowest grade. grade

18:03.558 --> 18:04.479
in the class.

18:07.222 --> 18:11.546
I'd forgotten how many we had that year, about 60, 
and he had the lowest. He made, he was the only one

18:11.646 --> 18:18.634
below 70, and he made a grade of 58, I think. And I 
couldn't understand it. And he came around and

18:21.437 --> 18:25.401
asked me to give him part of something to study. I 
says, look, a man with a PhD, don't you ask me how to

18:25.481 --> 18:31.287
study. I said, you'd better go somewhere else. I 
said, I can't give you any leads. I said, I can tell

18:39.581 --> 18:41.963
you this, you're a memorizer. And I said, you can't 
see the forest for the trees. And I said, get with

18:48.509 --> 18:54.895
somebody who takes notes and can pay attention. I 
don't know whether he was paying attention. I

18:56.817 --> 19:00.100
think he was glorying in that he'd just received 
his PhD. But he took it in taxonomy. I found and

19:03.160 --> 19:11.312
later checked on him, and some of them said, he got 
it on taxonomy, which is rote memory. I said, well,

19:11.332 --> 19:12.493
that explains it. I said, when it comes to thought 
questions, he can't do it. I said, they'll find him

19:16.719 --> 19:18.602
out in clinic. And he was found out in clinic. He 
made C's. And everybody else was making B's and

19:22.408 --> 19:25.893
A's. But that was an exception. That just stands 
out like a sore thumb to me. But just to show you the

19:33.232 --> 19:40.959
quality, I think he was a crybaby. And

19:42.701 --> 19:55.633
I had been warned by others who taught him as a 
freshman, sophomore that he's been crying on your

19:42.701 --> 19:55.633
shoulder for a grade or something. And he had to 
work like everything to get a C with me. And he was

20:01.143 --> 20:03.265
trying to talk me out of a beat. I said, no way. I 
said, you're a C student. And I said, your record

20:07.469 --> 20:16.096
shows that you've never made higher than a C. And I 
said, you surely haven't done better than a C with

20:07.469 --> 20:16.096
me. But I warned another student, one of the girls 
who came to me, about him being so good that I'd been

20:16.176 --> 20:28.227
studying with him. I said, well, get away from him. 
I said, he's the only class, he's like the lowest

20:30.488 --> 20:34.113
grade in class. I said, do your own thinking. And I 
said, you're a memorizer too. And I said,

20:41.143 --> 20:51.557
I'm going to start asking questions

20:41.143 --> 20:51.557
that are not out of the book. Thought questions for 
you people. I said, I'm going to change my type of

20:54.801 --> 20:58.426
attack. And So they started making lower grades. 
But they finally worked out. They were two in the

21:04.696 --> 21:06.578
same class. But in general, what would you say is 
the quality of the students? Very good. In fact, I

21:12.305 --> 21:14.468
had lots of As. And I wasn't known to give an A or many 
As. But I had quite a few of them. And

21:21.416 --> 21:29.166
I remember one class in the 40s.

21:32.217 --> 21:43.387
before we started screening them,

21:32.217 --> 21:43.387
that we had too many for one section. I had around 
90, I think, 80 or 90. And I said, well, we're going

21:50.974 --> 21:55.779
to divide it into two sections in lecture. And I 
couldn't get them. There were a bunch of students

22:00.854 --> 22:05.541
that wouldn't fit. What do you mean they wouldn't 
fit? Nine, they wouldn't fit the schedule. Oh. And

22:12.831 --> 22:22.766
if I had just put two and two together, they were 
flunkies, and they

22:12.831 --> 22:22.766
had such an irregular schedule, there were nine of 
them.

22:25.630 --> 22:30.777
And I had,

22:25.630 --> 22:30.777
or eight. Every one but one had an F at the end of the 
semester. Hold on. No, I had seven F's and two D's or

22:38.662 --> 22:42.828
C's. I forgot what a passing grade was then. So it 
bothered me, and we always had a correlation

22:46.214 --> 22:55.228
between physiology, my courses, and the 
chemistry and the biology. So I went to Dr.

22:55.782 --> 22:57.204
Haddish. He said, don't bother. He said, when we 
get classes in here, the majority of them flunk.

23:01.549 --> 23:03.892
Well, that was true in freshman chemistry. And we 
took those same students and found out that all

23:05.594 --> 23:12.623
nine of them flunked chemistry. And I went to the 
biology. All nine of them flunked biology. I said,

23:17.950 --> 23:19.492
well, I'm a softy. I said, I passed two of

23:20.153 --> 23:24.979
them. The other two, and believe it or not, in the 
largest of the three sections, there were a bunch

23:25.600 --> 23:36.212
of buddies in there and they all got together. All 
the A's were in that section, in the largest. And I

23:41.799 --> 23:45.123
had a bunch of A's.

23:47.345 --> 23:49.768
So I learned a lot about teaching. These boys, 
these nine students, were about two weeks behind

23:50.035 --> 23:56.964
the other two sections when we got through. I just 
had to skim through part of it. No wonder. I let them

24:02.291 --> 24:03.693
set their own pace. In this large section, they 
were going higher than the second, but I learned

24:04.654 --> 24:09.581
better. Tell

24:09.621 --> 24:19.654
me about how difficult you thought the course work 
was in 1923 and 24. Well, I think for one thing they

24:20.765 --> 24:27.859
let us take too much work, sign up too many hours. 
And I think that gave rise to the limiting the

24:29.542 --> 24:36.916
number of hours that they could take. In the 30s, we 
did that in the 30s.

24:43.748 --> 24:47.974
I mean, you could take any, back in the 20s, you 
could take as many hours as you wanted. Dr.

24:48.114 --> 24:54.584
Francis, who was a dean, he says, you do a whole lot 
better work if you're busy. So you want any more

24:54.624 --> 24:56.346
courses on that? I'll just give you more. That's 
what he said. That was his attitude. So as a result,

25:03.316 --> 25:07.362
why, some of us overloaded. I would think so. But I 
learned, man. less than the hard way.

25:21.699 --> 25:30.308
But when they started limiting the number of 
hours, I don't recall what year, that was in the

25:21.699 --> 25:30.308
late 20s or early 30s, they did that. But that 
helped a lot. Did you find the coursework very

25:34.753 --> 25:39.658
difficult, or do you think it's increased 
difficulty over the years? It should be more

25:42.852 --> 25:48.139
difficult now because the student now has so much 
more to learn. And with all the research, it's far

25:49.461 --> 25:54.027
better now. Of course, as we got larger and larger, 
the students got less contact with the clinical

25:55.549 --> 26:08.346
animals, but they have a very efficient way of 
handling clinic now. It's much better, the

26:08.630 --> 26:13.234
curriculum is much better than it was back in those 
days. In what way is it more, is it better? Well,

26:16.116 --> 26:38.535
working in small groups in these clinic groups of 
six or eight students or something like that, and

26:16.116 --> 26:38.535
back in, oh, in the middle 30s or 40s where you'd 
have large groups, and they didn't have it

26:16.116 --> 26:38.535
organized as well as they do now. Of course,

26:39.967 --> 26:46.255
we didn't have satisfactory textbooks for most 
courses. We had a good one in physiology, and we

26:47.497 --> 26:52.423
didn't have a good one in pharmacology. We had 
nothing in toxicology. So we had to more or less

26:55.507 --> 27:02.877
make our own notes, lecture notes, out of 
journals. And some of the other books, some

27:04.058 --> 27:09.265
foreign books and lab manuals, were practically 
unknown and so we had to more or less write our own

27:10.308 --> 27:15.094
lab instructions.

27:18.878 --> 27:24.485
But we all learned from it, managed it somehow. I 
was wondering about when you were a student in the

27:25.886 --> 27:32.434
mid-1920s, who were your favorite instructors? 
Well some in animal husbandry and later in

27:34.574 --> 27:42.125
veterinary medicine, but some of them out. I would 
say Dr. Silvey, head of the physics department,

27:43.847 --> 27:48.453
was one of my favorites. Dr. Bilsing, head of 
entomology, was one of my favorites. Mr. Stangle,

27:56.444 --> 27:58.908
W.L. Stangle, we called him Runt. He was later dean 
head of Allen Vesbury and Dean at Texas Tech.

28:16.870 --> 28:22.117
Mr. George Templeton, who was head of the 
department for several years, left here and went

28:16.870 --> 28:22.117
to Mississippi. And then Dr. Francis in 
veterinary medicine was one of the greatest

28:31.122 --> 28:33.384
probably the greatest man I've ever known. In 
fact, that's one reason I came back here, to teach.

28:40.330 --> 28:46.656
I wanted to take three years of graduate work with 
him, or teach.

28:49.439 --> 28:58.547
But

28:49.439 --> 28:58.547
I worked with him and under him for 10 years before 
he died in 36. Well, let's talk about Dr. Mark

28:58.865 --> 29:02.170
Francis now. Tell me about your relationship with 
him. Well,

29:07.658 --> 29:14.209
he was the dean and head of anatomy. When I came here 
in 26, there were six teachers, and I think there

29:14.970 --> 29:27.589
were four wives, Mrs. Francis, Mrs. Marstella,

29:30.337 --> 29:32.759
Mrs. Leonard and Mrs. Wharton. Wharton was in 
pathology. But there were six of us teaching,

29:35.882 --> 29:51.237
three of them in veterinary medicine surgery, one 
in pathology, one in anatomy,

29:35.882 --> 29:51.237
and one in physiology.

29:56.762 --> 29:57.643
And now They have over 100 teaching staff

29:59.092 --> 30:15.514
and about 150 or more in the classified personnel, 
that is technicians. We didn't have a single

30:15.534 --> 30:18.778
technician in the 20s. One telephone, one 
stenographer or secretary She was at the dean's

30:27.425 --> 30:32.710
office in the mornings and then with the veteran of 
medicine and surgery in the afternoons. And if I

30:35.052 --> 30:47.824
had to write a letter, well, I had to get it in the 
morning or either write it that day or that evening

30:35.052 --> 30:47.824
and then have it at her desk in the morning so she 
could type it. And

30:49.365 --> 30:54.630
no technicians.

30:57.580 --> 30:59.507
But we had one
