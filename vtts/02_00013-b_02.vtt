WEBVTT

00:02.748 --> 00:06.574
want to rinse your regulator and a little chlorine just so you don't spread germs.

00:06.954 --> 00:07.655
And you hang that up.

00:07.696 --> 00:16.449
And then right away, you take a, now we have such a wonderful camp, we can take a warm water, fresh shower right away because we have fresh water maker and we have all kinds of pumps.

00:16.729 --> 00:19.614
We had four flush toilets this summer for the first time ever in a camp.

00:20.655 --> 00:23.019
We used to just have a little outhouse over the sea somewhere.

00:23.840 --> 00:29.128
And how far away normally are the camps from a town?

00:29.649 --> 00:31.692
This one is,

00:32.667 --> 00:38.258
probably, it's a 40 minute by fishing boat.

00:38.778 --> 00:45.311
The fishing boat probably does about six miles an hour, so it's probably four miles from the nearest village where there's a road where we can park cars.

00:46.313 --> 00:51.823
And we have, we once stayed in a place before we had a fresh water maker, the glass wreck where

00:51.803 --> 01:01.740
The nearest town was three hours away by boat, and the only fresh water we had for 30 people was brought out twice a week in 55-gallon oil barrels.

01:01.760 --> 01:07.009
And that meant that we had to bathe in salt water and then just have one cup a day to rinse in.

01:07.049 --> 01:08.852
You let it trickle over, you had to get the salt out.

01:09.493 --> 01:17.727
And so when I say that things were rougher in the old days, yeah, we've got a lot of fancy things like fresh water makers now.

01:17.707 --> 01:26.670
So then they'll be filling tanks, then somebody else will be barge chief, and then there'll be people who don't have anything else to do, will be removing concretion,

01:26.971 --> 01:30.536
or sieving the amphoras, or there'll be people upstairs cataloging.

01:31.278 --> 01:54.413
And all this is now done with computers so that instead of bringing back a trunk full of field notes, dialogues, catalog cards, negatives and all that, now on one CD-ROM I bring back every single object that's cataloged with a beautiful color photograph of the object right there.

01:54.899 --> 02:00.907
We keep a daily log and we take turns, a diary where students take turns writing about what's happened during the day.

02:01.247 --> 02:11.200
We illustrate each day with two digital color photographs, either underwater on the site or something that's happened in the camp that day or some specific object or sometimes just a fun picture like a toga party we had.

02:14.144 --> 02:16.587
So then there are other people working in the computer room.

02:16.647 --> 02:19.911
We have an air conditioned computer house now.

02:19.891 --> 02:31.833
the camp and they're working on the plan entering all this all these data that allow them to make this three-dimensional plan using photographs and measurements and things I don't even understand.

02:32.113 --> 02:36.381
There'll be other people there maybe keeping the daily journal that's like our diary.

02:37.002 --> 02:39.285
So everybody is busy all day.

02:39.305 --> 02:40.787
Everybody is very busy all day.

02:40.847 --> 02:41.829
Then lunch is?

02:42.390 --> 02:53.746
Lunch is at 1230, and we've had for the last few years a wonderful, and I know it sounds like an oxymoron, a fantastic English cook, a young lady that, I mean, we don't lose weight when we dive anymore.

02:53.786 --> 03:02.618
We used to lose 20 or even 30 pounds in the field because the water, even when you're wearing a wetsuit, absorbs heat and burns calories very quickly.

03:03.099 --> 03:05.963
But she makes so many wonderful dishes,

03:05.943 --> 03:07.487
And she has a very full kitchen.

03:07.547 --> 03:09.812
It's no longer just a little tiny stove or something.

03:09.832 --> 03:14.744
She has, you know, an electric oven and two refrigerators, a deep freeze.

03:14.784 --> 03:17.149
We have a fresh, you know, a drink cooler.

03:18.032 --> 03:20.357
And so we have a nice lunch.

03:20.742 --> 03:39.780
And then usually we start the diving again at between, we get back together, we'll ring a bell, and everybody comes back to the dining room, which is just a large room with all the roofs except for the computer room, which has got a red tile roof, or just roof with matting.

03:39.760 --> 03:44.347
And with some plastic sheets in case it rains because we got caught in rainstorms and we didn't have that.

03:44.807 --> 03:50.796
And then we just put mosquito netting around so we're not being bitten by flies or mosquitoes when we have our meals.

03:50.856 --> 03:54.021
And so you're in a place like a pavilion of some sort.

03:54.041 --> 03:56.344
And it's a large room with a lot of tables and chairs.

03:57.206 --> 04:02.013
And so we'll have another meeting and discuss the afternoon's work and people can tell what they've done.

04:02.053 --> 04:04.116
And then we go back and repeat what we've done in the morning.

04:04.957 --> 04:06.359
We try to have dinner at 7.30.

04:06.660 --> 04:08.923
We try to turn off all the generators at 10 so that

04:09.224 --> 04:10.808
People get a good eight hours sleep.

04:11.309 --> 04:16.922
If they want to leave with a flashlight in bed, they can do that, but we ask them not to talk or anything, that sort of thing.

04:17.784 --> 04:20.149
How many days a week do you do that?

04:20.169 --> 04:21.953
We do this six days a week.

04:22.354 --> 04:24.820
Friday is our day off, not Sunday, because Friday,

04:24.800 --> 04:27.804
traditionally had been market day, and that's when we go buy a lot of the food.

04:28.546 --> 04:30.829
And it's just stayed Friday no matter where we are.

04:31.730 --> 04:34.575
And so it's six days a week.

04:35.216 --> 04:50.318
One of the things that is of interest is that, I don't know whether, you can always edit this out, but because this has been a dry campus for so long, is that just because we're diving, we don't allow anyone to have more than one

04:50.669 --> 04:51.731
alcoholic drink a day.

04:51.791 --> 05:01.770
So that means with their dinner, before dinner, after dinner, whenever they want it, they can have a glass of wine, a beer, or a cocktail if they've got the makings out there, which very few people do.

05:02.091 --> 05:05.638
It's hot, so those that want alcohol usually go to the cooler and get a beer.

05:05.998 --> 05:06.880
And we don't pay for that.

05:06.960 --> 05:08.603
People check their own soft drinks and beer.

05:09.004 --> 05:12.791
And a lot of them, a surprising number of kids today are non-alcoholic.

05:12.811 --> 05:13.673
It's not that they

05:13.653 --> 05:14.855
have anything against it.

05:14.875 --> 05:19.641
It's just they've never got a taste for it, and so a lot of soft drinks go.

05:21.122 --> 05:21.903
Where do you get ice?

05:23.465 --> 05:29.173
We have a deep freeze, and we have a cooler, and we make ice with the refrigerators.

05:29.653 --> 05:29.914
Okay.

05:30.374 --> 05:34.920
I mean, we're pretty nicely now.

05:34.940 --> 05:40.487
Have there ever been any awkward religious moments in the Turkish projects?

05:41.075 --> 05:42.817
of the projects located in Turkey.

05:43.338 --> 05:46.441
There's never been one that's a humorous one, but it's back when I was at Penn.

05:46.461 --> 05:49.765
There was a young girl who was, who was a very devout Catholic.

05:49.785 --> 05:51.767
And we were going to Yasada, that means Flat Island.

05:51.807 --> 05:55.391
It's a, it's an absolute rock, the size of a football field.

05:55.952 --> 05:58.075
And it's where we spent about seven or eight summers of our lives.

05:58.095 --> 06:00.618
In fact, we have worked there since we've been at Texas A&M.

06:00.658 --> 06:05.143
And this devout Catholic girl just knew we were going to this island and said, is there a Catholic church on it?

06:05.783 --> 06:10.609
And, uh, I wanted to say, oh dear me, there's not a Catholic church within.

06:10.589 --> 06:14.574
100 miles of where we were going to be, but she came and, and, uh.

06:14.614 --> 06:20.162
Describe what it's been like working with the Turkish bureaucracy, Turkish government.

06:20.182 --> 06:22.745
We've had excellent relations with the Turkish bureaucracy.

06:23.526 --> 06:25.889
Um, uh, they like us.

06:27.431 --> 06:30.435
Um, they, they know our affection for the country.

06:30.475 --> 06:31.096
They feel it.

06:31.116 --> 06:31.737
They sense it.

06:32.097 --> 06:37.204
Even though I'm not fluent in Turkish, they'll, they'll ask me sometimes at an international meeting,

06:37.184 --> 06:40.049
Come on, sit with us, George, you know, you're half Turkish.

06:42.214 --> 06:46.782
We've had, we've run into people who have made life difficult, but that can happen anywhere, I suppose.

06:47.103 --> 06:57.302
We've run into, once we had a chief of police in the early days, but that's in the early sixties, who sort of harassed us because he was moored and we were the only thing in town that was that visible.

06:57.755 --> 07:11.656
One of the things that helped us is that from Bodrum being a town of 5,000, a little sleepy fishing village where you drove over unpaved roads 10 hours to get there and now you whiz in on a dual lane highway and three hours from Izmir, the nearest town.

07:11.896 --> 07:14.700
There's a huge international airport in Bodrum, I forgot that.

07:14.680 --> 07:16.843
It's B-O-D-R-U-M.

07:17.244 --> 07:18.445
B-O-D-R-U-M, uh-huh.

07:19.187 --> 07:25.416
And so one of the things that helped us is that now there's so many foreigners here in the summer that people don't notice us like they used to.

07:25.516 --> 07:27.739
So that's helped us a great deal.

07:29.381 --> 07:32.706
Has anyone ever tried to walk off with some of the

07:33.327 --> 07:36.270
priceless items that you all have located?

07:36.310 --> 07:43.638
We have, in general, covered our wrecks with tons of sand at the end of each summer to protect them.

07:44.119 --> 07:45.220
People know where we are.

07:45.240 --> 07:46.221
They can see us.

07:46.841 --> 07:51.326
A foreign yacht could sail in at night, and this has happened in other countries, and tear a sight to pieces.

07:52.147 --> 08:00.516
And so we covered not so much to hide it, because anybody that goes by our camp knows exactly where we're diving every day, but just to make it more difficult for somebody to go and pick something up.

08:00.496 --> 08:04.566
However, we have no evidence that anyone's even tried to do that, and in fact,

08:04.917 --> 08:15.030
We raised, we now raise everything, but in the early days, we were so naive, we thought that all the amphoras on the wreck were alike, and so we'd raise a sample and just set the others aside.

08:15.531 --> 08:20.797
And so we still go back now to a site we dug in the early 60s, and we can't see that anybody's ever touched those amphoras.

08:20.817 --> 08:25.784
They've been sitting down there for almost 40 years, and yet it's not within sight of any Coast Guard base or anything.

08:26.164 --> 08:29.689
I think that Turkey does protect its coast.

08:30.089 --> 08:32.893
I think that the diving is very controlled.

08:32.933 --> 08:34.435
It's illegal to dive.

08:34.415 --> 08:37.679
outside of certain areas because they're trying to protect their wrecks.

08:37.699 --> 08:39.008
So there's always a

08:39.612 --> 08:50.745
tension between the Department of Tourism, which wants to open more of the coast to tourist, diving tourists, and with the Ministry of Culture, which doesn't want people to loot their wrecks.

08:50.785 --> 08:53.448
Turkey has the most, it's preserved its wreck.

08:53.468 --> 08:55.350
Turkey and Greece better than anybody.

08:55.370 --> 09:04.260
I've dived in other countries in the Mediterranean where, you know, everything has been stripped clean because of sport divers and amateur divers, not necessarily evil people.

09:04.280 --> 09:09.366
People think it's all right to take a souvenir and don't know that they're irreparably destroying a site.

09:09.346 --> 09:16.398
Now, all the materials you all find officially belong to the Turkish government, is that right?

09:16.418 --> 09:23.429
And do they ever allow you to bring any of those objects back to the United States to study and then return back to them?

09:23.549 --> 09:36.130
We can bring samples of some things like bones and seeds if we need to, or samples of wood for dendrochronology or carbon-14, but they have a lot of their own labs there now.

09:36.110 --> 09:39.200
so it's probably not done as much as it was.

09:39.943 --> 09:44.778
Um, but not, uh, items that I would identify perhaps as an art object, you cannot... Not, no.

09:44.819 --> 09:48.651
However, they would be very happy for us to have a traveling exhibit

09:49.053 --> 09:57.525
of what we've done, and we almost had a traveling exhibit in this country of the Ulubarun shipwreck, which is so phenomenal.

09:57.565 --> 09:59.167
It was a royal ship, there's no doubt of that.

09:59.227 --> 09:59.728
It's so rich.

09:59.748 --> 10:03.833
It's got the only gold scarab ever found of Egypt's most famous queen, Nefertiti.

10:03.873 --> 10:12.445
It's got the oldest glass ingots ever found, the largest collection of gold and silver Canaanite jewelry any archaeological site's ever produced.

10:12.425 --> 10:16.969
It's got ivory objects of incredible beauty.

10:17.149 --> 10:22.794
It's got probably the finest Canaanite statuette ever found, a female covered with gold, a bronze statuette.

10:23.395 --> 10:25.016
And they were willing to let that go.

10:25.697 --> 10:31.602
What happened is, of course, you have to set up various venues in America and you have to raise money to do it and have the exhibitors and so forth.

10:32.043 --> 10:37.007
And the man, the curator of the museum, which was going to take the lead in this, died.

10:37.507 --> 10:38.829
And nobody else has picked up the ball yet.

10:38.849 --> 10:40.390
This has happened within the last two years.

10:40.370 --> 10:48.988
And it's too bad because now they've opened their own museum just for that, and while it was still being built, they would have let it go, the whole thing, out of the country for a year or two.

10:49.008 --> 10:50.712
Now it would be much harder for that to happen.

10:50.772 --> 10:52.496
I think it's a fantastic museum.

10:53.197 --> 10:55.442
All right, now let's, Chronologic, let's go back.

10:55.861 --> 10:59.689
When you first got here in the mid-'70s, what was the project?

11:00.530 --> 11:07.484
The first one we did was the glass wreck, the medieval glass wreck.

11:07.504 --> 11:08.967
And that was about how many years?

11:09.448 --> 11:11.512
That we spent two and a half, three summers on.

11:11.712 --> 11:13.876
So you finished that in the late-'70s.

11:13.896 --> 11:14.337
Mm-hmm.

11:14.357 --> 11:14.738
Then what?

11:15.419 --> 11:16.722
We did some surveys.

11:16.702 --> 11:18.365
We worked on a Hellenistic wreck.

11:18.385 --> 11:23.933
We never completed that excavation because it turned out it went under a boulder slide and it was just logistically difficult to do.

11:24.894 --> 11:31.705
We had people working in other places in the Caribbean and Italy and Mombasa, Kenya.

11:33.387 --> 11:34.990
I'm trying to think of where else how students have gone.

11:36.051 --> 11:37.333
I mean, all over the place.

11:38.255 --> 11:38.836
The Great Lakes.

11:39.016 --> 11:40.498
I mean, lots of places.

11:40.732 --> 11:47.649
So in Turkey itself, between 70 and 74, we didn't do an excavation, we did surveys.

11:47.669 --> 11:51.619
And then we got this fantastic Bronze Age shipwreck, which took 11 summers.

11:51.920 --> 11:55.986
That was followed by Fred Hawker doing a Byzantine ship for four summers.

11:57.187 --> 12:01.954
And then we started this classical Greek ship just two summers ago.

12:02.315 --> 12:19.058
And the reason we chose it, it's the only shipwreck ever found from the third quarter of the fifth century BC, which is the golden age of classical Greece, when Pericles and Sophocles and Myron and – I mean, it's when the Parthenon was being built.

12:19.038 --> 12:22.082
you know, the height of classical Greece.

12:22.102 --> 12:26.007
And unfortunately, the ship is not as rich as I'd hoped, but still, it's going to fill in the gap.

12:26.047 --> 12:26.648
It's worth doing.

12:26.948 --> 12:28.610
And what are its dimensions?

12:29.191 --> 12:30.052
It's not very big.

12:30.072 --> 12:32.155
We were finding almost no wood.

12:32.175 --> 12:33.256
We don't understand that yet.

12:34.317 --> 12:38.683
But the only things that we found other than pottery which really stand out as we've

12:39.052 --> 12:41.435
found the ship's two marble eyes.

12:42.317 --> 12:45.721
And people didn't know that they were made of marble before, except for warships.

12:46.643 --> 12:52.110
But this was a very, very modest little merchant vessel, probably 40 feet long, something like that.

12:52.431 --> 12:56.797
And yet it had painted marble eyes, one on each side of the ophthalmote.

12:57.798 --> 13:00.122
And we found some new types of anchors on it.

13:00.983 --> 13:05.329
So we'll have a very nice collection of well-dated pottery from that quarter century.

13:05.309 --> 13:08.374
But we don't find any fine painted ware, for example.

13:08.414 --> 13:09.996
We haven't found any coins.

13:10.096 --> 13:12.019
For some reason we haven't found any tools or weapons.

13:12.400 --> 13:13.742
So I'm disappointed in that sense.

13:14.342 --> 13:18.949
But then it was probably about the size of the fishing boat that takes me back and forth from the camp to the village nearby.

13:19.510 --> 13:20.852
And if that sank, what would you find?

13:20.872 --> 13:27.342
A plastic jerry can, maybe a pocket knife, you know, a screwdriver, not much.

13:28.143 --> 13:30.547
How did y'all locate this vessel?

13:30.607 --> 13:34.152
This was found during one of our annual surveys when

13:34.132 --> 13:40.789
Two divers were simply being towed, actually, rather than swimming about 120 feet down, and they spotted it at 140 feet.

13:41.611 --> 13:46.504
We now have this two-person submersible we can do with three knots, three miles an hour,

13:46.838 --> 13:52.507
150 feet down, and I think we're going to find an incredible number of wrecks.

13:52.587 --> 13:54.109
You asked how we got along with the Turkish government.

13:54.129 --> 14:03.624
This is not for here, but I'll just say that I came home with my heart broken and determined I'd never set foot in Turkey again because of what happened this year, but that's another story.

14:03.784 --> 14:04.846
The Coast Guard stopped us.

14:05.667 --> 14:07.510
Somebody convinced them that we're smugglers.

14:07.730 --> 14:09.032
They stopped us after three days.

14:09.793 --> 14:11.255
They're taking us to court.

14:11.636 --> 14:12.998
It's very, very messy.

14:12.978 --> 14:16.183
We've been through these things before, and so I'm willing to fight it.

14:16.203 --> 14:24.778
We have some very powerful Turkish friends who are, uh, one's uncle is the head of the whole Turkish navy, and I think that we'll come out on top, but, uh, it's too bad it happened.

14:25.219 --> 14:30.868
Um, what is, uh, of the, uh, in all of your work, what is the oldest

14:31.321 --> 14:34.225
in terms of age, the oldest site y'all have worked?

14:34.365 --> 14:51.449
The oldest site is a little controversial because everybody doesn't agree that it's that old, but I'm convinced it's just a bunch of pottery, largely huge jars, stand three or four feet high, big open mouths, from I think 1600 B.C.

14:53.112 --> 14:57.598
There are some archaeologists, well-known archaeologists, I think it's much later from like 1000 B.C.

14:57.578 --> 15:00.482
However, one of our students here wrote her master's thesis on it.

15:00.522 --> 15:02.344
She's Greek, and she's convinced that I'm right.

15:02.605 --> 15:05.188
She's not just trying to please me, and she has good reason for it.

15:05.428 --> 15:07.111
And it will be published at 1600 BC.

15:07.431 --> 15:09.674
But whether or not we call it a real shipwreck or not, we don't know.

15:10.035 --> 15:11.296
We never found anything else.

15:11.817 --> 15:13.419
One of the jars was 100 feet from the others.

15:14.400 --> 15:18.065
We never found a toothpick-sized piece of wood, so we don't understand it.

15:18.245 --> 15:21.730
Maybe some sort of crude vessel capsized, and that's what we have.

15:21.963 --> 15:26.174
But after that, the one from 1300 BC, this Ulubaroon shipwreck is the oldest.

15:26.515 --> 15:35.558
And that's considered the only shipwreck ever excavated because there are others like the one we did where it's a scatter of pottery and you don't know exactly how to explain it.

15:35.578 --> 15:37.744
You mean the oldest by anybody, anywhere?

15:37.859 --> 15:43.689
Well, they're dugouts found in lakes that go back and over, but a real ship, a sailing ship.

15:43.709 --> 15:52.344
Oh, they're older vessels, like buried in the Egyptian sands are some vessels, so I should say seagoing, only shipwreck, not the oldest evidence of a vessel.

15:52.845 --> 16:01.200
As far as anyone knows, how far back did seagoing vessels, when did they originate?

16:03.830 --> 16:05.012
At least 40,000 years ago.

16:06.073 --> 16:06.895
Maybe more.

16:08.156 --> 16:18.532
People could not have reached Australia at any point since humanity has been around without crossing water, because that's why there are kangaroos there, but not in India.

16:19.393 --> 16:23.239
And there's this certain space that somebody had to get across.

16:23.219 --> 16:27.445
The same thing can be said for the... I'm much more familiar with the Mediterranean, so I'll speak about that.

16:27.905 --> 16:40.742
We know that when people were living in caves in the Middle Stone Age, the Mesolithic period, they were going to the island of Milos to get obsidian, the hard black volcanic stone with which they made scrapers and blades and so forth.

16:41.083 --> 16:47.371
It's been identified as coming from Milos, and the only way to get to Milos then is now is to go buy some sort of watercraft.

16:47.752 --> 16:49.314
So that's 11,000 years ago.

16:49.934 --> 16:52.618
We know that they colonized Crete

16:53.358 --> 16:56.705
about 8,000 years ago, about 6,000 B.C.

16:57.567 --> 17:07.587
I used to think that, you know, maybe some poor guy was washed up with his wife clinging to a tree floating, but

17:08.073 --> 17:10.598
You know, we don't think sometimes.

17:10.839 --> 17:12.262
That couldn't possibly be the case.

17:12.943 --> 17:20.919
A graduate student of archaeology at Cambridge University wrote one of the best papers I've ever written on the deliberate colonization of Crete in 6000 B.C.

17:21.560 --> 17:26.250
He studied with animal husbandry people and found out

17:26.230 --> 17:31.797
You can't just take one pregnant cow and start a herd because by inbreeding it won't work.

17:31.837 --> 17:35.761
So you have to have, I think, something like six cows and six dogs.

17:36.202 --> 17:40.006
I mean, they arrived there with sheep and goats and cows and dogs.

17:40.847 --> 17:43.891
They arrived with, started planting grain right away.

17:43.931 --> 17:50.078
And he said probably that when they went with work, they have big enough to carry families and animals.

17:50.530 --> 17:54.719
and probably tons of grain to get through the first winter because right away they planted crops.

17:55.400 --> 17:57.024
So it was a deliberate colonization.

17:57.385 --> 18:02.616
So that was, that's before people lived in houses, before they had

18:02.900 --> 18:06.404
could make pottery before they had any kind of metallurgy, they were crossing the sea.

18:06.945 --> 18:10.309
So seafaring is probably one of the very oldest professions.

18:11.010 --> 18:13.213
So fourth century B.C.

18:13.313 --> 18:14.215
you all have worked on.

18:14.955 --> 18:15.096
Uh-huh.

18:15.116 --> 18:15.536
And what?

18:15.817 --> 18:17.779
Or older, okay, sixteenth century B.C.

18:18.280 --> 18:19.441
Oh, I'm sorry, sixteenth century.

18:19.481 --> 18:20.643
Thirteenth century B.C.

18:20.863 --> 18:24.067
And now, what's the most modern you all have worked on?

18:24.428 --> 18:25.549
Right now,

18:25.529 --> 18:44.819
Bartu Arnold, who works for INA, he was the state archaeologist of Texas after Carl Clausen, and he is the one that published the 1554 fleet, and he is the one who located and built the large copper dam around La Salle Ship La Belle, and now he's joined us.

18:44.879 --> 18:51.029
He is doing a Civil War blockade runner in Galveston now, the Denby.

18:51.049 --> 18:53.072
So, the 1860s, so…

18:53.052 --> 18:57.199
Now, some of our people may have worked on more recent wrecks in rivers and lakes in this country.

18:57.539 --> 19:01.566
I'm trying to think whether we have actually sponsored anything much later.

19:01.606 --> 19:14.166
We've certainly done a lot of stuff on 1812, War of 1812, and Revolutionary War ships in Lake George, Lake Champlain, and the New York River in Penobscot Bay, Maine.

19:15.328 --> 19:15.768
Let's see.

19:16.570 --> 19:18.132
We have some students right now.

19:18.787 --> 19:19.668
working on the Hunley.

19:20.268 --> 19:22.591
The, uh, the head of the whole project is one of our graduates.

19:22.991 --> 19:23.912
And we have two graduate students.

19:23.952 --> 19:25.654
The Civil, isn't that a Civil War submarine?

19:25.674 --> 19:26.194
Oh, yes, yes.

19:26.215 --> 19:26.375
Yeah.

19:26.955 --> 19:27.736
In Charleston.

19:28.036 --> 19:28.177
Yes.

19:28.977 --> 19:32.080
Now, of, uh, the, all the projects you personally?

19:32.100 --> 19:32.481
No.

19:34.062 --> 19:34.563
Wow.

19:34.743 --> 19:39.748
Texas A&M and, um, INA together, uh, with the U.S.

19:39.788 --> 19:43.512
Navy, uh, did an archaeological survey of Normandy.

19:44.150 --> 19:44.673
That's right.

19:45.075 --> 19:45.900
I forgot about that.

19:46.282 --> 19:46.885
All right.

19:47.488 --> 19:50.042
So, so.

19:50.579 --> 19:57.528
Not quite 4,000 years, but more than 3,000 years.

19:57.848 --> 20:02.054
Of all the projects that George Bass has worked on, what's the favorite for you?

20:02.774 --> 20:05.818
Oh, without any doubt, the Bronze Age shipwreck.

20:05.838 --> 20:09.263
As I say, that's considered one of the great archaeological finds of all time.

20:11.886 --> 20:13.969
Even though I'm not the one that's going to publish it.

20:13.989 --> 20:19.776
See, 20 years later, I'm just now almost getting the second volume ready on the glass wreck to go to the Texas A&M University Press.

20:19.756 --> 20:29.248
I didn't tell you that the Texas A&M University Press started an article archaeology series for us, and that was subsidized by the Association of Former Students to get the first volume out.

20:29.668 --> 20:33.252
And then we started a second series, which are cheaper books for students to use.

20:33.593 --> 20:38.038
And a lot of these are our students' better master's theses are published, and it's soft cover.

20:38.439 --> 20:41.583
And they've been so popular, and the English publishers picked up the English rights.

20:41.603 --> 20:47.670
And so Texas A&M University Press now has two world-renowned series on article archaeology.

20:47.650 --> 20:58.251
All right, and one of the notes I had written to mention to you after we get through, but I'll mention it on this, as I'm hoping that you would write a history of the INA for the press.

21:01.302 --> 21:13.000
I am certainly thinking about a number of things in my retirement, but one of them is to be a history to be published a hundred years after my death, because it's going to be filled with stories that you would not believe.

21:13.621 --> 21:21.233
And I just think that even the children of the people shouldn't be, I mean, the poor guy who shot his wife to death, or the woman who had her throat slit by her boyfriend.

21:22.675 --> 21:26.922
But we do need that, we do need somewhere for that to be done sometime.

21:26.902 --> 21:45.213
I wrote a book called Archaeology Beneath the Sea, a personal account, which was the story of my beginnings in this field from 1960 to 1973 when I formed INA, and it ends with the discovery of the glass wreck and this wreck from 1600 B.C.

21:45.654 --> 21:48.839
It came out in 75, so it was before I came to take CNN.

21:48.859 --> 21:49.360
Who published that?

21:49.400 --> 21:51.323
It was published by Walker and Company.

21:51.303 --> 21:56.553
And even though they got me on the Today Show to push the book, it's such a small publisher that it had no circulation.

21:56.573 --> 21:57.815
It got good reviews.

21:57.835 --> 22:03.747
However, it came out in Italian and Bulgarian and Japanese.

22:03.807 --> 22:04.689
Is it out of print?

22:04.709 --> 22:04.969
Oh, yeah.

22:05.069 --> 22:08.856
What about the press doing a second edition with you doing an intro?

22:08.957 --> 22:10.560
Well, it's now being e-published.

22:11.001 --> 22:11.522
Oh, okay.

22:11.722 --> 22:12.704
I brought it up to date.

22:13.044 --> 22:13.345
Oh, okay.

22:13.325 --> 22:15.948
just with a long chapter covering the last 25 years.

22:16.629 --> 22:20.915
However, I would like to write a sequel to it, to be published in my lifetime.

22:21.095 --> 22:24.179
All right, now that's what I'm talking about, for the NM Press.

22:24.199 --> 22:32.970
Of all the individual objects you have found, what are some of the most interesting, exotic, favorite objects?

22:33.794 --> 22:35.236
Each wreck probably has its favorite.

22:35.316 --> 22:42.465
Cape Galladonia probably a little stone cylinder seal some merchant had carried that he would use as his document to roll it out over clay.

22:43.126 --> 22:47.892
And it was carved in Syria 400 years or more before the ship sank.

22:47.932 --> 22:51.917
So it must have been a family heirloom passed from father to son in some merchant family.

22:53.159 --> 23:00.308
From the Yasiata Byzantine wreck, which was a 7th century Byzantine ship, it would have been the bronze, lead-filled,

23:00.288 --> 23:05.880
bust of Athena, which was used as the counterbalance for a scale of weighing device on the ship.

23:06.701 --> 23:13.475
From the defense, a leather powder horn.

23:14.277 --> 23:15.760
Or was that from the Yorktown wreck?

23:15.780 --> 23:16.582
Ooh, I can't remember.

23:17.905 --> 23:19.528
From the glass wreck,

23:28.283 --> 23:39.118
It's funny because I published a little grooming kit with a pair of scissors, part of a razor, and a wooden delousing comb because I farmed out to the world authorities.

23:39.818 --> 23:45.126
Somebody at the Ashmolean Museum is publishing the copper and bronze utensils on the ship.

23:45.446 --> 23:48.670
Marilyn Jenkins at the Metropolitan Museum of Art is publishing the glazed pottery.

23:50.673 --> 23:54.218
One of the top bone experts is publishing the faunal remains.

23:55.119 --> 23:57.362
I had so many experts publishing it.

23:57.342 --> 23:59.786
that I didn't say much for myself.

23:59.847 --> 24:05.537
But that was so human that I got into the whole study of vermin on people at sea.

24:05.978 --> 24:08.182
Columbus's sailors complained about lice.

24:08.602 --> 24:10.666
Magellan's sailors complained about vermin.

24:10.686 --> 24:13.451
And so that must have been very important, this little delousing comb.

24:13.832 --> 24:16.617
I got into the history of beards, types of scissors used.

24:16.597 --> 24:21.722
uh, shaving, uh, it just, it made it very human for me.

24:21.962 --> 24:26.426
And a little hand-carved chess set, which, uh, none of us recognized in one of our graduate students.

24:26.446 --> 24:27.867
See how valuable it is to have a seminar.

24:28.468 --> 24:32.071
I, I gave him two little funny-looking little pieces of wood, and I said, see if you can figure out what these are.

24:32.091 --> 24:36.535
And he came back a week later and gave a wonderful seminar report on the oldest dated chess set in the world.

24:36.595 --> 24:42.161
There were two castles, and he recognized them from a medieval ivory carving of two women playing chess.

24:42.381 --> 24:43.802
They're nothing like modern books.

24:43.782 --> 24:47.879
It's just a little piece of flat wood with a notch in the center.

24:48.522 --> 24:50.450
And so that made it human.

24:50.470 --> 24:52.257
That was nice.

24:53.249 --> 24:58.436
The Ullaburun shipwreck, the Bronze Age shipwreck, the gold chalice.

24:58.876 --> 25:01.340
I mean, it's a chalice about that big.

25:01.400 --> 25:06.647
Archaeologically it's not very important because we don't know where it was made or when, but it was just such an exciting discovery.

25:06.867 --> 25:07.768
And it was caught on film.

25:08.749 --> 25:16.860
It was, when it was actually uncovered by hand, one of the cameramen was there, and then when Robin Pearcy comes up the ladder, he telephoned with the telephone booth.

25:16.840 --> 25:17.663
who had a little telephone.

25:17.683 --> 25:19.047
He said, get George over here right away.

25:19.489 --> 25:22.198
And so they had two cameras and sound for this Nova film we made.

25:22.679 --> 25:24.746
And Robin comes up the ladder and I said, what you got, Robin?

25:24.766 --> 25:25.348
He said,

25:26.307 --> 25:27.729
I shouldn't be the one to tell you this.

25:27.990 --> 25:28.911
Jack and Jamal, they found it.

25:28.931 --> 25:29.773
And I said, what is it?

25:29.793 --> 25:32.437
And he said, I've never, ever seen gold.

25:32.457 --> 25:33.198
I mean, so emotional.

25:33.218 --> 25:34.680
People think we scripted and acted it.

25:35.041 --> 25:36.303
I've never seen gold like that underwater.

25:36.323 --> 25:36.904
I said, what, what?

25:37.285 --> 25:39.989
He says, it's a gold bowl, I'm sure of it, you know.

25:40.029 --> 25:41.832
And it was very exciting.

25:41.852 --> 25:44.677
And gold found like that is shiny?

25:44.977 --> 25:45.778
Just absolutely.

25:46.079 --> 25:51.167
Gold, it's valuable because it's rare, but I think it's also valuable because it doesn't corrode.

25:51.147 --> 25:54.314
So most of the metal you take out of the sea has to be treated with great respect.

25:54.334 --> 25:56.438
Go and just rinse it off, and there it is.

25:57.060 --> 25:59.645
It may have a little concretion on it, but sometimes there's not even any concretion.

25:59.665 --> 26:00.748
Silver will be dulled?

26:01.750 --> 26:04.436
Silver can disappear completely.

26:05.598 --> 26:09.747
I don't understand necessarily what happens with...

26:11.363 --> 26:12.545
electrolysis underwater.

26:12.986 --> 26:18.577
But even on some modernist wrecks like two or three hundred years old, the silver coins are all horribly corroded.

26:18.977 --> 26:24.288
But now the silver jewelry on this 3,300 year old ship is beautifully preserved.

26:24.728 --> 26:26.672
So it just depends on the conditions.

26:26.652 --> 26:32.800
Are there any metals that are particularly difficult to work with?

26:32.900 --> 26:38.989
Iron disappears, but we have now developed the world standard for how you do it.

26:39.810 --> 26:52.727
When things fall in the water, when iron falls in the water, and we know this because we lost a hammer once from our deck and found it a year later, within one year it's covered completely with a coating of calcium carbonate, and this builds up in thickness over the years so it can get to be one or two inches thick.

26:52.707 --> 26:55.872
So what we do is we find these amorphous lumps of concretion.

26:55.972 --> 26:59.938
We treat them as carefully on our plans as things we recognize.

26:59.958 --> 27:00.579
We don't know what they are.

27:01.040 --> 27:06.408
We bring them up, we'll x-ray them first, because the iron inside is rusted away, so it's just an empty cavity inside.

27:07.069 --> 27:20.048
Then we know where to break them, and then we put in epoxy, and then with pneumatic chisels we remove the concretion, and we have an absolutely perfect epoxy replica of the original iron implement.

27:20.028 --> 27:22.992
And these are so accurate that we've even done locks.

27:23.012 --> 27:27.318
It took a month to do one lock with the intricate inner workings and springs still intact.

27:27.638 --> 27:28.820
But it's all plastic.

27:28.840 --> 27:35.088
The scissors I talk about and the razor, we can cut paper with them, but it's plastic because the original iron disintegrated centuries ago.

27:37.572 --> 27:37.972
Let's see.

27:39.094 --> 27:41.597
Most frustrating, most difficult project.

27:41.577 --> 27:42.538
To work with.

27:42.558 --> 27:43.198
This fall.

27:45.000 --> 27:52.327
Because we were all set for a two-month survey, and it raised a great deal of money from National Geographic and others, and everything worked beautifully.

27:52.367 --> 28:01.755
On the third day, we found a Roman wreck 130 feet deep, and we thought, oh, we were ready to celebrate, and the Turkish Coast Guard came out and stopped us.

28:02.396 --> 28:05.238
So, it was the lowest I've ever felt, I think.

28:05.278 --> 28:11.584
Oh, no, certainly no lower than when the Cypress War stopped the first INA project after just one week, and I thought,

28:11.564 --> 28:13.467
you know, there goes the institute.

28:13.487 --> 28:14.127
What am I going to do?

28:14.308 --> 28:15.650
Go back to work for the post office?

28:15.690 --> 28:20.937
And what made it frustrating was that you knew the potential and you weren't, haven't been able yet to continue with that.

28:21.117 --> 28:21.357
Yeah.

28:21.377 --> 28:30.670
But have there been some other projects that were frustrating that you thought you'd found something and as you really worked on it, it turned out to be very little in terms of importance?

28:30.818 --> 28:31.279
No.

28:31.920 --> 28:41.193
Our wrecks have usually, for almost the 40 years I've been in this, have been the major wreck being excavated in the Mediterranean at any given time.

28:41.233 --> 28:46.801
There's no more important wrecks ever found than the glass wreck and the Ullabroon wreck.

28:47.181 --> 28:49.765
And we don't want to ever get to be second to anybody else.

28:49.785 --> 28:53.991
We're very competitive because you're always competing for funds and students and everything else.

28:53.971 --> 28:58.062
And that's why we got this submarine, so we can go out and find an Iron Age wreck.

28:58.082 --> 28:59.847
I'd love to find an Iron Age wreck.

29:00.128 --> 29:01.471
One's not been known.

29:01.933 --> 29:04.680
Or a Neolithic wreck, or an early Bronze Age wreck, or a Minoan wreck.

29:04.700 --> 29:07.608
I mean, people say, what would you like to find?

29:07.909 --> 29:09.533
You know, a dozen things.

29:09.513 --> 29:10.674
equally exciting.

29:10.895 --> 29:12.036
A wreck full of bronze statues.

29:12.356 --> 29:17.802
Most of the original Greek bronze statues in the world today come from beneath the sea because they weren't melted down by later people.

29:17.822 --> 29:18.423
They were preserved.

29:18.703 --> 29:21.346
But there mostly finds of sponge divers in the early part of the century.

29:21.927 --> 29:26.552
So, you know, to find a wreck and excavate it carefully with statues would be very exciting.

29:27.053 --> 29:34.221
Share some examples of the amusing kinds of incidents or goofs or mistakes.

29:35.551 --> 29:40.660
Oh, I like to talk about our mistakes because other people can learn from them.

29:40.720 --> 29:43.424
For example, in the early days, we knew nothing about conservation.

29:43.444 --> 29:44.045
We were pioneers.

29:44.446 --> 29:46.710
We would rinse things off for a week in fresh water.

29:47.571 --> 29:57.528
And now what's happened is they look great in the museum for 30 years, but after 35 years, it took that long for the salts inside to crystallize and start making the surfaces exfoliate and come off.

29:57.588 --> 30:00.192
And so our professional conservators now have to work on those.

30:00.745 --> 30:06.434
We didn't know how to only we used to just pour the mud out of the amphoras not knowing we were losing very valuable evidence.

30:07.275 --> 30:15.948
In the early days the equipment wasn't nearly as safe for diving because we didn't have the sea view gauge and so you just run out of air and pull a reserve and if you didn't have a reserve you hope your buddy was close enough to buddy breed.

30:16.489 --> 30:18.592
We did a lot of that stuff and now we don't do that anymore.

30:18.612 --> 30:21.977
We don't want excitement on a dive.

30:23.746 --> 30:28.998
Are there any kind of pranks or tricks or that are normally played on the beginner?

30:29.038 --> 30:33.529
There was one done to me back, it was terribly funny at the time.

30:33.589 --> 30:37.177
It's a long story.

30:37.197 --> 30:40.084
It's in the book Archaeology Beneath the Sea.

30:40.064 --> 30:43.248
We used to have this expression, bye-bye stupid, when people would jump in the water.

30:43.368 --> 30:46.212
It's a long story behind it, and so we even named the Bards the bye-bye stupid.

30:46.672 --> 30:58.286
And when Larry Jolene was paralyzed by the Benz, and as we took him out of the chamber and sent him up in 1961 to Istanbul to be treated in the chamber, the last thing that was said to him when this U.S.

30:58.347 --> 31:01.971
Army plane, light plane, picked him up to take him was bye-bye stupid.

31:01.951 --> 31:11.964
Well, we found, I found on the wreck one day half of a, it was right after we found a small glass disk, a little pendant, we found a larger one.

31:12.165 --> 31:13.947
And this small one had a Greek monogram on it.

31:14.368 --> 31:19.815
And this one had Greek writing, it was blue-green glass and it was cracked in half and I was trying to make out what the, what the Greek said.

31:19.855 --> 31:25.423
And I couldn't find it and I looked and looked for several dives for the other half because I wanted to find it.

31:25.923 --> 31:28.026
And finally, I think somebody else
