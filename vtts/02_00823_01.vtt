00:05.144 --> 00:13.915
I am Marty Romero, and this is an interview with 
Mrs. Travis Bryan in her home on the morning of

00:05.144 --> 00:13.915
April 15, 1976. This is part of the Texas A&M Oral 
History Program.

00:22.166 --> 00:26.752
Because

00:22.166 --> 00:26.752
it makes it so permanent. Oh, I know. Well, why 
don't you go ahead and just tell me something about

00:30.056 --> 00:32.639
yourself. I can erase a towel back if I don't want 
to. It can be known publicly. Well, you asked me the

00:38.806 --> 00:40.609
question. OK. Well, you might just start by 
telling me a little bit about yourself, maybe how

00:40.629 --> 00:46.156
old you are and how you got here. Well, I was born 
here. My mother and father were Mr. and Ms. H.L.

00:50.982 --> 00:51.563
Boatwright. And I was born in 1896, and I've lived 
here all my life. And the only time I was gone was

00:59.273 --> 01:03.298
when I was away in college. visits, of course, so 
I've been right here almost 80 years. Oh, did you

01:08.627 --> 01:09.928
meet your husband here? It's a wonderful 
experience to live, I think, your life out in the

01:09.988 --> 01:16.394
town where you were born. At least I have loved it. I 
thought, of course, years ago that when I married,

01:18.496 --> 01:28.365
maybe I'd move away, but as it turned out, I was so 
happy that I did get to live here in my place, the

01:18.496 --> 01:28.365
place of my birth. And, uh, It's just been 
wonderful. I have made friends that have been here

01:32.216 --> 01:36.022
forever, all my life. Oh, wow. That I've known all 
my life, and I have loved every minute of it. Well,

01:41.469 --> 01:41.750
neat. Did you have all your children here then? My 
mother and father had two other children. I had a

01:46.817 --> 01:51.604
sister and a brother, but I was the youngest one in 
the family, the baby. And they were a little bit

01:52.846 --> 01:55.650
older than I was. My sister was 12 years older than I 
was, and my brother was... ten years older than I

01:59.540 --> 02:02.023
was. And my mother and father lost a child, a 
miscarriage, in between my brother and me. And so

02:07.911 --> 02:11.676
that's why there was such a difference between 
them and me. But it never did make any difference.

02:15.881 --> 02:17.684
We were all such a happy family. And I don't know 
anything in the world about children not wanting

02:17.704 --> 02:24.733
to stay in their mother's and father's home. You 
know, it's a style now to move out when you've got to

02:24.753 --> 02:28.838
be about 16 or 17 years old. And we had such a happy 
home. This is the house my mother and father built

02:30.959 --> 02:34.764
when I was six years old. Oh, really? This is where I 
grew up as a child, in this very house. And we moved

02:39.469 --> 02:43.374
up here when I was six years old. And I got to be seven 
soon after we moved here. And school was right

02:46.478 --> 02:48.340
across the street. So the school bell would ring, 
and I would just wait till it rang. Then I'd run out

02:52.725 --> 02:56.450
the front door and run across the street and be on 
time for school. And so it was very convenient. But

02:59.868 --> 03:13.722
then when I got along up in the senior years at 
school, my father was a Baptist deacon and very

02:59.868 --> 03:13.722
active in the Baptist work, the Baptist church 
here. And so he and some others went together and

03:13.743 --> 03:18.788
built a Brown Baptist Academy. And it was a Baptist 
school, a denominational school. And since my

03:23.052 --> 03:28.558
family was such a devout Baptist, he wanted me to 
leave the public school system go to the Baptist

03:28.876 --> 03:30.659
school. So I did. So I did not graduate from the 
Brown school. I graduated from the Baptist

03:34.745 --> 03:37.850
Academy in high school. It was the same curriculum 
and all, you know, same studies and everything,

03:37.870 --> 03:45.041
but just different schools. So, and then I went to 
Mary Harden Baylor College in Belkin. I was

03:49.508 --> 03:55.117
majoring in music, voice and piano and pipe all of 
them. My mother taught me pipe all of them. Oh. And

03:58.250 --> 04:06.221
so I went to Mary Holland Baylor for two years at 
Belton, Texas, and then I left to go to New York

03:58.250 --> 04:06.221
City. I didn't graduate from Mary Holland Baylor. 
I went on to New York City and studied there, music.

04:14.932 --> 04:16.274
And I had graduated. I had two diplomas in music, 
piano. And then, of course, the man I was supposed

04:20.419 --> 04:26.507
to marry, going to marry, was in... France and 
Germany in World War I, and so we had to delay our

04:27.027 --> 04:33.117
marriage until he came back. So I didn't get 
married until 1921, May 17th, 1921. And

04:39.588 --> 04:49.845
we just had one son, he was Travis Brown Jr., and 
he's at the vice chairman of the board of the First

04:39.588 --> 04:49.845
National Vice. And he has two sons, so I have two 
grandsons, Travis Brown III and Timothy Norman

04:50.753 --> 04:57.323
Brown. Travis III is a lawyer, and the other one is 
going to be a banker. And Travis III is going to come

05:03.212 --> 05:06.918
into our new bank. We're building a new bank 
building, the First National. And so the bank, of

05:10.243 --> 05:12.486
course, needs a lawyer. And so he's going to have 
his office and work in the First National Bank,

05:12.546 --> 05:18.195
too. All my folks have been bankers, right there in 
the First National Bank. My father was president

05:22.221 --> 05:29.108
of the bank, and my husband was president, and my 
son was president, and now he's chairman of the

05:22.221 --> 05:29.108
board. My brother was in the bank, vice president. 
And we just don't know anything about making a

05:33.452 --> 05:38.758
living except in that First National Bank. And my 
life mainly has been spent in this home and my

05:38.778 --> 05:43.363
church. I was brought up to be a Christian. And my 
mother and father were devout Christians. They

05:50.588 --> 05:58.237
thought that the only way to be excused from going 
to church was to either be sick or to have a death in

05:50.588 --> 05:58.237
the family. And if someone died and was buried on 
Saturday, we were in church on Sunday morning. And

06:05.647 --> 06:08.290
so that's the kind of parents I had. My grandfather 
was a Baptist minister, F.M. Law. And I grew up in a

06:13.096 --> 06:15.780
strict home. I mean by that, They were not like so 
many parents today. My mother and father were

06:20.727 --> 06:22.029
here. When I came home from school, my mother was 
here. And they knew where I was at all times. And

06:28.318 --> 06:35.428
when I went out on a date at night, when I was growing 
up and a young girl, I was supposed to be home by

06:28.318 --> 06:35.428
midnight. And if I wasn't, they just took the town 
to pieces looking for me. We didn't play cards. We

06:44.880 --> 06:45.701
didn't drink. My father said he'd rather have a 
dozen rattlesnakes turn loose in his house than to

06:46.001 --> 06:51.988
have liquor in his home. We don't know anything 
about drinking. I don't have any idea in the world

06:53.890 --> 06:57.414
what to even call for if I wanted to drink. And it's 
very repulsive to me to see it on television, all

06:58.015 --> 07:03.281
these shows. They don't seem to get in the room, but 
they all happen to have a drink. And so they were

07:08.047 --> 07:11.511
faithful Baptists. members of the First Baptist 
Church and they taught me to be too and so my life has

07:11.727 --> 07:21.822
been taken up with my home and the First Baptist 
Church working for the Lord. Of course that is the

07:22.583 --> 07:35.783
most important thing for anybody but I was going on 
to say so many young people can't even stay until

07:22.583 --> 07:35.783
they're grown but I stayed seven years after I was 
married in my mother's home. They were just so

07:37.613 --> 07:40.378
grieved to think that I was getting married. They 
were happy for me to marry, but they didn't want me

07:40.398 --> 07:42.902
to leave home. So they had this grand big house. 
There's 22 rooms and three stories. And they began

07:48.471 --> 07:55.003
to beg my future husband to let us live in this 
house. It's so big, and they were the only ones

07:55.023 --> 07:59.630
going to be here because my brother and sister were 
both young then. They were older, as I said, than I

07:59.651 --> 08:01.714
was. So there would be just the four of us in this big 
house. And my mother just cried. She said, oh,

08:06.594 --> 08:09.178
please don't leave yet a while. Let me get used to 
you being married. My father was the kind of person

08:12.864 --> 08:20.936
that said that he would cut off both of his hands 
before he would strike one of his children. And so

08:21.897 --> 08:26.864
we didn't know anything about spankings or being 
hit by our parents. We were just taught right from

08:27.846 --> 08:30.790
wrong. We loved each other so that we did not want to 
hurt our parents, and so we don't know anything

08:31.175 --> 08:42.948
about disobeying and acting ugly and saying other 
things to our parents. We just didn't know

08:42.968 --> 08:44.109
anything about that. That wasn't done. In fact, I 
cannot recall that there was ever an unkind word

08:45.450 --> 08:53.159
spoken between my mother and father and the three 
children. We all loved each other, devotedly, and

08:53.959 --> 09:00.186
we just didn't know anything about fussing and 
going on. My child was born, I was still living in my

09:00.638 --> 09:11.473
mother's and father's home, and soon after he was 
born and was several years old, I decided it was

09:00.638 --> 09:11.473
time for us to have our own home. So my mother said, 
well, do you want us to give you the walk down there

09:11.493 --> 09:18.263
where we used to keep the cows and the horses? 
Before we had an automobile, we had a very

09:18.743 --> 09:25.633
beautiful Victorian carriage, and we drove two 
black horses to it. And they had a leverage driver

09:26.086 --> 09:30.953
to drive the carriage and the horses. And then all 
of us, as we were growing up, had our own horse to

09:30.973 --> 09:35.820
ride horse by. And we had such a happy home. And my 
mother and father loved us, and we loved them. And

09:42.510 --> 09:45.895
it was just a delight to come home. And this has been 
such a happy home always. It still is. And my

09:50.362 --> 09:53.106
husband and I, we hardly had a... We didn't have an 
unkind word. We disagreed sometimes. He was a

09:56.423 --> 09:59.065
member of the Presbyterian Church and I was 
Baptist. Sometimes I'd tell him what I believed

09:59.486 --> 10:05.791
about my religion and that it didn't quite agree 
with his. And I'd say, now you know I'm right and

10:05.891 --> 10:08.614
you're wrong. And he'd say, no, I'm right and 
you're wrong. That's about the extent of our

10:10.996 --> 10:13.358
disagreements. I don't know anything about 
fussing or even arguing with people. I don't like

10:19.084 --> 10:19.944
that. I don't think Christians are supposed to do 
that. We are to be filled with the love of God and to

10:23.545 --> 10:29.250
express that to everyone with whom we come in 
contact. And our main work in this life is to win

10:30.231 --> 10:39.019
long souls to Christ and to witness to long people. 
And if you're going around fussing and acting ugly

10:39.459 --> 10:48.227
and blessing people out and using bad words and all 
such as that, your influence is ruined. And so we

10:49.328 --> 10:52.050
didn't go to cocktail parties and Well, I never did 
dance a step in my life. I don't know one cog from the

10:55.751 --> 10:57.452
other. My daddy said that we had a boy growing up in 
this house, and that it might be that if we all got to

10:58.553 --> 11:12.846
play in cogs and all, that he would turn out to be a 
gambler, because so many people do gamble with

10:58.553 --> 11:12.846
cogs, pussycats, and so now they gamble with most 
everything. And so it was strict in that sense, but

11:14.288 --> 11:21.454
it was so full of love that you didn't mind the 
strictness. You loved it. And I appreciated my

11:22.675 --> 11:34.373
parents because they were doing it because they 
loved me and because they wanted to keep me out of

11:22.675 --> 11:34.373
the penitentiary and make me grow up to be a decent 
human being and a Christian human being. And so I

11:34.433 --> 11:37.597
praise the Lord every day. And as I grow older, I 
appreciate more and more the fact that my mother

11:37.718 --> 11:44.127
and father had certain rules. We honored them. We 
knew when mealtimes was and we were here. We had

11:49.756 --> 11:51.298
family worship. And we learned a verse of 
scripture, a new verse of scripture every day. And

11:56.077 --> 11:59.701
it's the evening hour right here in this dining 
room. This is not the table. This was a table I

12:00.923 --> 12:02.785
bought for my home. We all had family worship. 
Everybody had come to the evening meal. And we all

12:07.951 --> 12:10.153
quoted a new verse of scripture. And we just loved 
it. We loved everybody. And really, I have never

12:13.958 --> 12:18.262
spoken an unkind word to anybody in my life. Can you 
believe it? One time... Oh, not too many years ago,

12:23.527 --> 12:27.892
two women came to my home. It's when I was living 
down here. My mother and father gave us that lot

12:29.193 --> 12:34.078
right down there, as I said, where we kept the 
horses and the cows. And they said, do you want to

12:35.179 --> 12:38.683
build your new home down there? In the meantime, 
they had sold the cows, and we had automobiles, of

12:39.263 --> 12:46.071
course, and so we didn't need that for the horses 
and cows anymore. And so we said, oh, yes, of course

12:46.151 --> 12:48.353
we did. So the little house right down here, right 
back at me in this same block is the home that my

12:48.873 --> 12:56.901
husband and I built, my son and his wife built down 
there. And so, what was I going to say? I forgot my

13:03.067 --> 13:04.889
train of thought now.

13:08.413 --> 13:13.598
Anyway, we moved down there in, I think, 1928. And 
my sister died in 1927. She was the first of the

13:16.490 --> 13:18.594
family to go. And then my father died in about seven 
years. And then my mother was next in 1944. And I

13:25.224 --> 13:29.951
lost my husband in 1964. And, of course, my 
sister-in-law died and my brother-in-law died.

13:38.182 --> 13:44.151
So I don't have any family now except my son and his 
wife and their two children and the

13:38.182 --> 13:44.151
great-grandson. And of course my grandson is 
married, one of them is, and he has a wife and this

13:45.072 --> 13:51.862
little baby who's three years old. So that's my 
family. And

13:53.584 --> 13:59.032
my other grandson works in a bank in Houston. He's 
learning to be a banker, and when he has finished

13:59.533 --> 14:05.421
the course in that Citizen's Life, the bank in 
Houston, He's coming back here to work in Albany,

14:05.924 --> 14:10.971
first master plan. It must be nice to have your 
family all get back together. Yes. This town was

14:18.182 --> 14:21.006
named for my husband's grandfather. And of 
course, that makes us love it all the more. He

14:24.351 --> 14:25.693
founded Brown. And Stephen F. Austin, his uncle, 
was the founder of Texas, you know, the father of

14:34.679 --> 14:39.224
Texas. And among the 300, he brought the 300, the 
first settlers of Texas. The first 300, he was, of

14:43.669 --> 14:47.312
course, the leader of them. So my husband's family 
founded this town and makes us just love it all the

14:47.613 --> 14:56.482
more, of course, and all the more interested in it. 
And it's very strange that my grandfather, who was

14:57.343 --> 15:01.007
a Baptist preacher, founded the town that my 
husband was born in, which was Giddings. So we had

15:07.304 --> 15:09.787
that to life about sometimes. And there's nothing 
exciting or interesting about my life. No one

15:16.573 --> 15:28.885
could possibly care anything about it because 
it's been just very normal and down to earth and

15:16.573 --> 15:28.885
nothing great to tell about. There have been a lot 
of prominent people in this house. My

15:32.435 --> 15:34.337
brother-in-law was a politician. And so he had 
some very important politicians to come here.

15:38.824 --> 15:42.930
William Jennings Brown, who was no kin to my 
husband. But anyway, he was a teetotaler, you

15:43.831 --> 15:46.194
know. He always turned his wine glass down when he 
was invited to social functions. So when he came

15:52.063 --> 15:55.868
here, he was a guest in our home one time, and... my 
mother served grape juice, just plain, fermented

15:56.455 --> 16:04.863
grape juice, just like we buy out of the bottle now, 
you know. So he just loved it. She told me, she says,

16:07.066 --> 16:09.288
don't be afraid to drink that. It's nothing in the 
world but just plain grape juice. So he thanked

16:12.511 --> 16:21.560
her, and he told her that from then on, every place 
he went, when they were all serving liquor and

16:12.511 --> 16:21.560
cocktails, he'd say, give me some grape juice. A 
woman in Texas taught me to drink grape juice. But

16:25.109 --> 16:29.894
mainly big Baptist preachers were entertained in 
this home. It used to be when we had revival

16:29.914 --> 16:32.517
meetings here. In those days, we entertained them 
in our homes, the visiting preachers, you know.

16:38.264 --> 16:46.713
And my mother and father thought that it was a very 
wonderful thing, the influence for their home to

16:38.264 --> 16:46.713
have these great preachers. George Turrett, I'm 
sure you two youngs have heard of him, but he's

16:47.754 --> 16:53.901
considered about the greatest Baptist preacher 
that ever was. And he was pastor of that big church

16:54.269 --> 16:58.154
in Dallas for so long. And he has been here so many 
times. And so, as they say in the White House,

17:01.559 --> 17:05.164
Lincoln slept here. So I can say that George Trude 
and William Jennings Brown and Joe Bailey, who was

17:05.744 --> 17:17.039
a big politician, and just all kinds of important 
people like that used to come to visit us. But

17:17.059 --> 17:19.703
mainly, my home was taken up with religion. And 
most people in the world today don't care about

17:20.915 --> 17:24.139
hearing. Not most of them. I won't say that. But so 
many people are not interested in you. They don't

17:29.005 --> 17:30.427
care about being with you. You know, a Christian is 
supposed to be a unique person. A person who stands

17:36.935 --> 17:39.278
out in the crowd. In fact, a person who does as the 
Bible says, come ye out from among them and be this

17:39.298 --> 17:46.727
separate. So my life, I'm sure, to most people is 
very dull. and dry and uninteresting because so

17:50.648 --> 18:02.664
many people are looking for worldly things and 
people of the world, people who have made a name for

17:50.648 --> 18:02.664
themselves in the world. I'm trying to live so that 
when I go to heaven, I'll have a nice home to live in.

18:11.335 --> 18:17.483
And I'm sewing on my wedding garment that I'm going 
to wear to the marriage feast. And I do honestly

18:18.391 --> 18:22.377
believe that the rapture is fast approaching. Of 
course, the rapture is when the church is taken out

18:22.478 --> 18:25.783
of the world. Every true believer is going to be 
called up into the heavens, and that is called the

18:26.724 --> 18:32.414
rapture. First of all, the dead in Christ are going 
to be called out of their graves. And those loved

18:39.305 --> 18:45.715
ones that you and I took to the cemetery, if they 
were God's children, they're going to just come

18:39.305 --> 18:45.715
right out of that grave. And they're going to be in 
the body that they will put down there in. Only it's

18:49.879 --> 18:52.221
going to be revived, of course. And they're going 
to look like they did as we knew them. Only then they

18:55.264 --> 19:02.110
will have a resurrected body, like we're getting 
ready to observe Jesus' resurrected body this

18:55.264 --> 19:02.110
coming Sunday. And then those of us who are on the 
earth, still living and are saved by the blood of

19:03.632 --> 19:14.441
Jesus Christ, we're going to talk life straight up 
into the clouds and be at home with the Lord. And

19:14.521 --> 19:16.343
then will be the marriage feast. And I'm working 
today, and have been all my life since I learned to

19:17.116 --> 19:26.246
be a Christian, I'm working on my wedding garment. 
Everyone who is a Christian and goes to heaven, of

19:27.288 --> 19:40.803
course they will go to heaven, they are saved, will 
be given a white robe showing that they are saved

19:27.288 --> 19:40.803
from their sins and that they are pure and white and 
clean. But those of us who work for the Lord will be

19:41.664 --> 19:46.870
given another garment called the toga, And it will 
be beaded with diamonds and studded with rubies

19:47.693 --> 19:57.044
and emeralds and sapphires and all kinds of 
precious stones. And the more deeds I do for the

19:57.845 --> 20:05.755
Lord and in His name, the more stones, the more 
precious stones I'll have on my wedding garment.

20:07.216 --> 20:09.639
And I don't crave those things for myself. I crave 
them for the Lord because it will show When he puts

20:14.120 --> 20:23.290
that garment on me, it will show that I have been 
tried to be at least faithful to him and have served

20:14.120 --> 20:23.290
him because I love him so. I don't count what he has 
done for me and for my family.

20:29.357 --> 20:31.119
He's given me perfect health. I've never been sick 
to imagine in my entire life. In 1954, I was in the

20:35.384 --> 20:43.333
grocery store one afternoon, and I had been 
working in the yard all day, a loft of garden,

20:35.384 --> 20:43.333
working the flowers. And my yellow man had gone, 
and I ran by the grocery store to pick up some steaks

20:43.904 --> 20:51.416
for my husband and me to have that night for dinner. 
And one of my friends was standing there, and she

20:52.338 --> 20:55.342
said, what's the matter with you? You're sick. I 
said, well, I'm not sick. She said, well, you

20:57.746 --> 20:59.189
certainly are. I said, well, what makes you think 
so? I don't feel bad. I said, I've been wearing the

21:03.135 --> 21:05.218
yellow all day long. She said, you're sick because 
your eyes are swollen. And I said, oh, my goodness,

21:09.588 --> 21:12.432
well, I didn't even know it. So I said to the man in 
the market, I said, give me my state's right of

21:13.013 --> 21:16.919
face. I've got to go to the doctor. So I got on my car 
and flew out to the doctor's office. It's right as I

21:22.167 --> 21:24.570
could to get there before he closed up. And I said, 
my friend, Miss Parker, tells me that I'm sick. He

21:29.277 --> 21:29.898
laughed. He said, she did? Well, what made her 
think so? I said, well, she says my eyes are

21:32.722 --> 21:34.685
swollen. And he looked at me and said, well, they 
are. And he took my blood pressure and examined my

21:37.465 --> 21:41.791
heart, you know, like they do. And he said, oh, I 
don't think anything's serious. He said, maybe

21:44.955 --> 21:46.698
it's just an allergy. So we piddled around. I went 
back to him. He said, you come back in about a week

21:50.463 --> 21:53.427
and let's see how they look in a week. So I went back. 
And instead of getting better, they had gotten

21:54.429 --> 21:57.633
worse. So after several visits with him, he said, 
you know, I'm not really prepared yet. He was a baby

22:04.523 --> 22:05.945
specialist. He said, I'm not really prepared to 
make all the tests that you need to have made. So he

22:10.676 --> 22:14.702
said, I think I'd better send you to the Ledbetter 
Clinic in Houston. So he sat me down there, and it

22:15.763 --> 22:21.371
took him four months to find what my trouble was 
because I was so beastly healthy. And I had no

22:22.112 --> 22:31.004
symptoms of anything being wrong with me except my 
eyes were swollen, and my skin and my face began to

22:22.112 --> 22:31.004
look a little funny. So finally, after the... 
Eliminating all the other possible things that

22:34.857 --> 22:45.532
might be wrong with me, Dr. Paul Labella down there 
in Houston said, well, it's bound to be pure

22:34.857 --> 22:45.532
gallbladder. And of course, he'd been taking all 
kinds of pictures of it, and it did not show up in a

22:46.394 --> 22:56.288
picture, so he decided that that was it, that it was 
blocked with gallbladder stones. So my husband

22:57.269 --> 23:04.560
and I went down to the Baptist Memorial Hospital in 
1955, and on June the 15th that year, Dr. Aylors,

23:05.452 --> 23:13.362
who was considered about the outstanding surgeon 
in Houston, removed my gallbladder. It was

23:13.422 --> 23:15.825
completely filled with stones. And so I sat up on 
the bed, on the side of the bed the next day, and the

23:15.925 --> 23:23.855
next day I was walking. Nothing has ever kept me in 
bed any length of time. I've had a slight case of the

23:29.001 --> 23:31.324
flu, I thanked twice, but I didn't go to bed. I would 
just lie down more and take a nap in the afternoon.

23:36.487 --> 23:40.174
And then I did have to have this major surgery. Then 
I had to go back one time and have my tonsils taken

23:41.116 --> 23:52.637
out, and my husband went with me then, and he said to 
the doctor, he said she never has stopped singing,

23:41.116 --> 23:52.637
she never has stopped talking, she never has 
stopped laughing. And we got up the next morning

23:53.090 --> 23:59.618
and went to Dallas for the weekend, and I ate shrimp 
cocktails and just had a time of my life. So my

23:59.638 --> 24:08.830
husband said to Dr. Lowe, who was the ER nose and 
throat specialist in Houston, the one who removed

23:59.638 --> 24:08.830
my tonsils, he said, I'm not going to pay you. You 
didn't take them out. So the Lord has blessed me so.

24:15.559 --> 24:16.900
And I had such a good time. You know, the girls all 
used to laugh at me. in my crowd, because I didn't

24:19.668 --> 24:27.358
dance, and I didn't drink, and I didn't play cards, 
and I didn't gamble, and all that kind of thing. And

24:27.558 --> 24:30.241
they said, well, you just might not have any fine 
dollars. But you see, the Lord blesses us. The

24:33.566 --> 24:39.753
closer we live to Him, and the more we try to please 
Him and serve Him, the more He's going to bless us.

24:40.575 --> 24:42.517
So I had plenty of boyfriends. I used to go with the 
Aggies. I went with the A&M professors. I had a

24:46.222 --> 24:48.785
chance to marry a good many of them. No. head 
football coach at A&M wanted to marry me. He came to

24:53.608 --> 25:00.034
New York to see me when I was up there and tried to beg 
me to marry him up there. And I had a gloriously

25:00.054 --> 25:02.577
happy time. Not because there was anything about 
me. I wasn't any different from any other girl. In

25:07.421 --> 25:12.326
fact, some of them were a lot better looking than I 
was, more attractive every way than I was. I was

25:12.446 --> 25:14.028
just a plain, ordinary girl. It was the Lord. 
showing me that you did not have to be a worldly

25:16.418 --> 25:21.343
person to have a good time. And the closer I have 
found all my life, the closer I live to him, the more

25:21.403 --> 25:27.189
the blessings flow to him. The other day I noticed 
that my feet were swollen. And I thought, oh, no, I

25:31.112 --> 25:36.818
certainly don't have an inch of strength to go to 
the hospital and go through the clinic. I just

25:37.879 --> 25:39.300
thought it would kill me. And so I thought, well, I 
have a Heavenly Father who knows exactly what's

25:40.001 --> 25:44.045
the matter with me. I'll ask him. So I said, Oh, dear 
Heavenly Father, please tell me. I'm going to

25:51.330 --> 26:00.981
close my eyes and I'm going to ask you, Lord, to open 
the Bible when you want me to see the answer and tell

25:51.330 --> 26:00.981
me if I'm sick, if I need to go to the hospital. Of 
course, I will if I have to. So this is the way I pray

26:03.865 --> 26:07.449
when I want a fast answer. So I closed my eyes and I 
picked up my Bible and I said, Now, Father, please

26:08.150 --> 26:14.337
open it to the verse you want me to see. So I opened 
it, and this is the verse. My eyes fell right on that

26:18.657 --> 26:20.620
verse. Thy faith hath made thee whole, go in peace. 
And I said, oh, thank you, Lord. Praise your holy

26:27.330 --> 26:28.411
name. I don't have to go to the hospital. And in just 
a very few minutes' time, he said to me, you're

26:30.995 --> 26:37.284
eating too much fermented cheese. You know, I 
don't like to cook anymore. My husband's not here,

26:39.387 --> 26:43.172
and I'm by myself, and I have arthritis. I don't 
feel like cooking anymore. So I'd been eating too

26:44.725 --> 26:47.569
many pomada cheese sandwiches. He let my feet 
swell to call my attention to the fact that I was

26:48.089 --> 26:52.895
doing something wrong. So he told me what it was. So 
I quit eating pomada cheese, and the swelling was

26:55.739 --> 27:00.525
gone the next day. Then when I went to Houston to 
have that gallbladder operation, my husband's

27:00.945 --> 27:08.995
face was as long as from here to college. He just 
knew I was going to die because I never had been

27:09.576 --> 27:12.960
sick. And so he put me in that Memorial Hospital 
down there. And that night, before surgery, he had

27:19.109 --> 27:30.767
gone on over to the hotel to go to bed in his room to be 
back for my surgery. So I said, now, Father, talk to

27:30.787 --> 27:33.811
the Lord. I said, I know you know whether I'm going 
to live or die. And I said, I'm ready to go to heaven

27:37.617 --> 27:40.521
any time you want me to. I don't mind dying tomorrow 
morning. And I'm ready to die. But I said, I

27:44.450 --> 27:46.152
certainly would like to know. My husband is so sad. 
He's just worried to death. Is there anything you

27:49.317 --> 27:52.361
could tell me that would cheer him up a little bit? 
And I said, now I'm going to take the Bible and let

27:53.363 --> 28:02.015
you open it with my hands and tell me what's going to 
happen to me during this operation. So this is the

28:03.357 --> 28:05.741
truth that I ever told him. He opened the Lord, 
opened my Bible. My eyes fell on this verse. The

28:11.193 --> 28:14.438
sickness is not unto death, but for the glory of 
God. That the name of the Son of God might be

28:14.999 --> 28:19.927
glorified. So I'm the happiest person here. I 
wanted to get out on the floor and kiss it because

28:23.512 --> 28:30.463
the Lord was in there and I was just shouting all 
night. And a little while, the nurse took a hand in

28:30.483 --> 28:35.331
the door and she said, it's time for me to give you a 
pill to make you go to sleep. I said, no. She said, I

28:36.590 --> 28:38.172
see you're nervous. You're scared because you 
won't go to sleep. I said, no, I'm not scared at all.

28:42.117 --> 28:44.100
I said, please don't come in the room. I said, God is 
in here and I'm visiting with him. And I'm not going

28:47.644 --> 28:49.186
to take a pill. And I'm not scared. And I'm not going 
to die. And I know I'm not going to die because God

28:53.071 --> 28:55.614
has told me to. And so I said, if you will, please 
don't come in right now. I don't want to interrupt

28:59.399 --> 29:01.982
my visit with the Lord. Then one time I... I had to go 
to the dentist. I had an infected tooth. And the

29:09.504 --> 29:11.606
doctor said, well, you just have to put it. That's 
all. So he pulled my tooth, and it was way back in the

29:12.307 --> 29:15.950
back of my mouth. He said, Ms. Brown, I'm awfully 
worried about this. He says, it's badly infected,

29:19.573 --> 29:23.697
and I'm so afraid the poison is going to go to your 
brain. I said, oh, Dr. Ritchie, I don't think it

29:23.717 --> 29:27.280
will. I said, I'm healthy. Nothing ever happens to 
me. It was Saturday, and so I said, I've got to hurry

29:31.004 --> 29:34.727
on home and Studied my science school last year. So 
I came out. He said, well, you come back in a week. I

29:41.026 --> 29:41.827
said, all right. So I came out home and just almost 
forgot about it. But when the next Saturday came, I

29:44.251 --> 29:47.136
remembered I had an appointment with him. So I went 
back and he said, well, you see, he x-rayed it. He

29:50.741 --> 29:53.125
said, the poison has gone to your head. And he said, 
oh, Ms. Brown, he said, it's dangerous. He said,

29:57.031 --> 29:59.115
you've got to go to the doctor right now. He had an 
open throat now immediately. I said, well,

30:01.999 --> 30:02.520
doctor.
