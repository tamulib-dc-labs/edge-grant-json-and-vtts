WEBVTT

00:02.866 --> 00:08.232
advisors, counselors that you now realize, as you look back, helped you greatly?

00:08.593 --> 00:13.759
Well, we had then a division that was called Basic Division.

00:14.580 --> 00:16.703
And it's kind of like General Studies, I guess, today.

00:17.844 --> 00:25.733
But I'll never forget, I went over there and they sat down with me at the end of my freshman year.

00:26.835 --> 00:29.498
I had flunked college algebra.

00:30.524 --> 00:34.349
And I think there may even have been another course I flunked.

00:35.610 --> 00:42.279
And they said, we want to retest you in the, in your mathematical ability.

00:42.299 --> 00:44.882
And I was not that good of a math student.

00:44.982 --> 00:50.069
And so the advice was, you may want to change majors.

00:50.529 --> 00:56.717
So I changed to architecture at the end of my, my

00:58.385 --> 01:01.048
It may have even been midterm of my freshman year.

01:01.108 --> 01:02.510
I can't recall for sure.

01:02.570 --> 01:04.953
But I was in architecture a year, two semesters.

01:06.394 --> 01:08.537
And I think it was mainly my sophomore year.

01:10.739 --> 01:14.904
And I was, you know, I'd been a painter.

01:15.004 --> 01:16.306
I'd been a bricklayer.

01:16.386 --> 01:18.989
I'd been a carpenter in high school.

01:19.089 --> 01:20.450
I knew enough about building.

01:20.491 --> 01:21.872
I liked to work with my hands.

01:23.254 --> 01:26.097
But architecture was not

01:26.448 --> 01:51.510
my cup of tea because it seemed like I'd spend every weekend up on the fourth floor of the academic building doing projects into the wee hours of the morning my sophomore year isolated away from people and I've always just been such a people person I had to get back so that's when I went over to see the people in business

01:52.182 --> 01:58.112
And I guess the man that had as much impact on me as anybody else was Herb Thompson.

02:00.296 --> 02:01.739
And he taught marketing.

02:01.759 --> 02:07.749
And so I went in to see him and he said, you know, I think you'd make great in the marketing area.

02:07.769 --> 02:08.931
So I changed to marketing.

02:08.951 --> 02:10.975
Had you had a class with him yet?

02:11.275 --> 02:11.495
Never.

02:12.698 --> 02:17.025
And I took two or three classes from Herb Thompson.

02:17.343 --> 02:23.790
And he was an excellent teacher and just really brought teaching alive.

02:24.490 --> 02:25.892
Did you all have a nickname for him?

02:27.954 --> 02:29.596
No, we didn't.

02:30.637 --> 02:34.080
I think practically every prof we did have, but we didn't for him.

02:34.881 --> 02:39.586
I remember I had Mr. Stewart, Judge Stewart.

02:39.606 --> 02:40.787
His nickname was Judge.

02:41.008 --> 02:44.211
I took B Law and C Law under him.

02:45.085 --> 02:47.748
And he was a good teacher.

02:49.791 --> 02:52.134
Now that was B for business and C for commercial?

02:52.374 --> 02:52.995
I guess.

02:53.095 --> 02:53.555
I don't know.

02:53.656 --> 02:56.599
It was just two, three-hour courses in law that we took.

02:57.721 --> 03:10.416
And I had sold Bibles and cookbooks and dictionaries for the Southwestern Company at the end of my freshman year in West Virginia all summer.

03:11.918 --> 03:14.181
And I had a lot of outstanding

03:15.359 --> 03:18.583
payments due me, about $450 worth.

03:20.086 --> 03:30.320
And, of course, I was so naive that I thought all these people would send their money on a weekly basis like they promised, or monthly, and they weren't paying me anything.

03:30.340 --> 03:43.358
So, as I was in Judge Stewart's class and he began to talk about contract law and all these kinds of things, it finally dawned on me, I went into his office and I said,

03:43.591 --> 03:46.654
Judge Stewart, I need some advice.

03:47.014 --> 03:48.456
And I told him what my problem was.

03:50.357 --> 04:01.688
And he said, well, son, if you'd bring me some stationery that you want to use, I'll dictate a letter for you and we'll get that money.

04:02.849 --> 04:03.950
I said, well, all right.

04:04.931 --> 04:11.337
So he wrote a letter that basically said, dear Mrs. Green, I have been

04:11.907 --> 04:16.671
employed by Mr. Walker to represent him in a lawsuit against you.

04:18.313 --> 04:26.700
And it's my understanding that you bought a Bible from him or a cookbook or a dictionary and you owe this amount of money.

04:28.602 --> 04:40.733
I don't know what West Virginia's law is like, but I know here in Texas, if you were to have to come here and face a judge,

04:41.287 --> 04:48.335
the expense and the out-of-pocket expense for you would be horrendous.

04:48.355 --> 04:54.582
And so my advice for you is before this goes to court is just send Mr. Walker what you owe him.

04:55.663 --> 05:01.369
And Haskell, I collected probably 90% of everything they owed me with that letter.

05:02.170 --> 05:11.260
And so I've always been beholding to Judge Stewart for not only teaching well in class but showing us how it worked to use an attorney.

05:12.607 --> 05:18.717
Other advisor or teachers that you remember with pride and gratitude?

05:19.418 --> 05:27.791
Well, I had a gentleman by the name of Stevenson that I took statistics under.

05:29.033 --> 05:36.184
And I liked him so much because I had failed it under a Dr. Roach that I didn't like.

05:37.548 --> 05:41.493
And it was one of those occasions where the man was right.

05:41.513 --> 05:42.414
He was a legalist.

05:43.595 --> 05:46.799
He had to have 70 to pass to make a D at that time.

05:46.899 --> 05:49.483
And I had 69 and a half, and he wouldn't give me a half a point.

05:50.083 --> 05:51.044
So I had to retake it.

05:51.825 --> 05:55.930
And under Mr. Stevenson, I thoroughly enjoyed it and learned a lot.

05:57.312 --> 06:05.462
When you and your buddies went to class, what were the expected rules of classroom

06:06.640 --> 06:09.022
attendance, activities, et cetera?

06:10.103 --> 06:16.429
Well, I took a math class one time, and I'll never forget the professor.

06:17.410 --> 06:22.355
It was, he had a nickname of Pop, Pop Lyles.

06:24.077 --> 06:33.846
And Mr. Lyles said, gentlemen, one of the things I know you want out of this class is a grade, and you want a passing grade.

06:34.703 --> 06:41.493
And he said, so if you want to follow some advice I'm going to give you, it'll help you pass the course.

06:42.294 --> 06:46.941
And he said, I expect you in class every time I'm here.

06:48.243 --> 06:51.948
And he said, that's the least you can do in order to get a C in this class.

06:53.029 --> 06:56.795
And it was good advice, because I did not cut classes regularly.

06:57.716 --> 07:03.124
And there were occasions where I did, but I was not a class cutter.

07:03.526 --> 07:06.910
generally because I needed all that in-class help I could get.

07:07.831 --> 07:08.933
What about staying awake?

07:09.934 --> 07:10.935
How easy was that?

07:11.656 --> 07:13.759
Well, there were times where it was difficult.

07:15.020 --> 07:18.525
I had a little technique that has always served me well.

07:18.685 --> 07:26.375
I'd watch some fellow student go to sleep and saw how ridiculous he looked, and he would help me stay awake.

07:27.476 --> 07:33.043
I also made a habit of sitting up front, and I found that that helped me stay awake a whole lot.

07:35.183 --> 07:46.079
Do you remember, if you recall, we'll put this back near the front of the transcript, do you remember what it cost?

07:46.099 --> 07:47.961
Do you remember that first year or any year?

07:50.465 --> 07:54.711
My freshman year, turnkey for two semesters was about $945.

07:54.952 --> 08:03.604
And the reason I remember that so well is I worked that summer selling books door to door, as I mentioned,

08:04.141 --> 08:18.575
And I had to have, my goal was to make $1,000 that summer because my folks wanted me to stay home and work in their little drive-in eating establishment where I had a guaranteed job.

08:19.395 --> 08:24.260
And yet I traipsed off to West Virginia with four of my buddies, going to spend the whole summer.

08:25.061 --> 08:29.505
And it was just their belief that I'd come home broke.

08:29.525 --> 08:31.887
And they said, we're not going to help you if you don't have the money.

08:32.660 --> 08:35.464
Well, I came back with about $1,400 profit.

08:36.846 --> 08:41.753
And so I paid for my sophomore year totally on my own.

08:43.856 --> 08:47.922
And that included room books, room board books, tuition, and fees?

08:48.043 --> 08:48.463
That's right.

08:50.226 --> 08:50.666
Let's see.

08:52.810 --> 08:54.352
Extracurricular activities.

08:55.894 --> 08:59.119
You were a churchgoer when you arrived?

08:59.299 --> 09:00.000
Yes.

09:00.368 --> 09:03.213
How did you get affiliated with the local congregation?

09:03.293 --> 09:04.775
Describe that relationship.

09:05.677 --> 09:21.262
Well, my roommate, this gentleman I mentioned, Don McGinty, I was going to church, and he said that the church he attended, which was the Church of Christ, had a devotional on campus on Tuesday nights at the YMCA.

09:22.745 --> 09:24.187
Now, I'll have to be honest with you.

09:24.207 --> 09:27.152
To some extent, it was a chance to get out of the dorm.

09:27.875 --> 09:30.799
And, you know, I'd be less than honest if I didn't say that.

09:30.859 --> 09:45.279
But we went to this devotional in the YMCA, and I formed some of the closest friends that are still my friends to this day because of my church activities.

09:46.240 --> 09:55.553
And I also found that going to church just seemed to make me a happier, stronger person.

09:55.988 --> 10:00.772
Because one of the things that I did not do was drink alcohol.

10:02.293 --> 10:06.617
And we had a number of guys in our outfit that were teetotalers.

10:08.739 --> 10:18.027
People had their various reasons, but my father had had difficulty with alcohol, and I just made a commitment in high school that I was never going to be an imbiber.

10:18.588 --> 10:19.328
And so I didn't.

10:20.069 --> 10:24.713
And as a result, when you went to church, you were around usually those kind of people.

10:25.469 --> 10:35.143
They had common beliefs, and their standard of living was very comparable to what we all tried to live.

10:35.163 --> 10:38.087
Now, you had been a Church of Christ member before you got here?

10:38.107 --> 10:38.848
I had not.

10:38.868 --> 10:39.409
Oh, oh.

10:39.629 --> 10:42.453
My background was in the Methodist Church.

10:43.374 --> 10:45.137
So this is your attachment?

10:45.157 --> 10:45.958
This is your first?

10:46.338 --> 10:47.200
Yes.

10:47.220 --> 10:53.248
And so I got acquainted with the Church of Christ through a girl that I dated in high school.

10:54.005 --> 11:00.678
And then a young man I met at Junction was also a member of the Church of Christ, and I went to church with him in the summertime.

11:01.840 --> 11:09.195
And so Don was very active in the Church of Christ, and so I went with him after I came to A&M.

11:09.378 --> 11:18.609
Were there other denominational activities on campus at that time?

11:19.910 --> 11:21.112
Yes, there was.

11:22.073 --> 11:29.341
We had what we called the Interfaith Council, and it was made up of guys from all religious groups.

11:30.322 --> 11:35.368
And it was a good organization to be involved with, and I was involved in that.

11:36.260 --> 11:39.524
And then another extracurricular activity was our hometown club.

11:39.544 --> 11:41.667
We had the Panhandle A&M Club.

11:42.648 --> 11:47.274
And I got to meet, you know, guys that were from all over the Panhandle.

11:47.294 --> 11:58.008
I'll never forget one of my best friends was a guy named Davis from Lubbock.

11:58.028 --> 12:03.335
And it was Ford Davis's brother, Davis Ford brother, his brother.

12:04.397 --> 12:05.558
And then there was,

12:05.943 --> 12:13.676
Another young man from up at Muleshoe by the name of Tom Thedford, and we'd ride back and forth.

12:14.878 --> 12:18.644
And there was a guy named Adrian Helms from Tohoka.

12:19.665 --> 12:24.694
And, you know, these were the people you needed rides back and forth with, and I didn't have a car that first semester.

12:25.094 --> 12:27.338
Now, did the hometown clubs get together every week?

12:29.061 --> 12:29.301
Um...

12:30.007 --> 12:30.988
Probably not.

12:31.148 --> 12:33.391
Well, I think sometimes we did.

12:33.911 --> 12:36.815
We did get together practically every week and have something.

12:36.975 --> 12:49.689
But as it became, you know, near the time to go home for Thanksgiving, Christmas, whatever, we would always have meetings and talk about transportation, that kind of thing.

12:49.709 --> 12:56.757
And did anybody, was part of it a swapping of news from home?

12:57.361 --> 13:07.331
Yeah, there was always some activities that were going on at home that we wanted to know about, how our local football teams were doing, that kind of thing.

13:08.052 --> 13:13.537
Because you didn't have the channels of communication like we do today, and making a call home was long distance.

13:13.577 --> 13:14.298
That was a lot of money.

13:15.118 --> 13:19.743
Was the YMCA still an important location for student activities?

13:20.043 --> 13:20.444
It was.

13:21.305 --> 13:25.849
It was very much a part of, I would say,

13:26.217 --> 13:29.200
the spiritually motivated activities that went on.

13:30.561 --> 13:31.442
Gordon Gay was?

13:31.482 --> 13:34.585
Gordon Gay was involved in it and was a man.

13:34.885 --> 13:51.921
I still remember to this day steak fries we had, and Mr. Gay would have that apron on and a chef's hat, and he'd be cooking these steaks over a grill, and we'd go over to one of the parks around or somewhere on campus, and it was an out.

13:51.941 --> 13:55.144
Was Mr. Cashin still around?

13:56.204 --> 13:57.666
I didn't know Mr. Cashier.

13:57.746 --> 14:00.729
I don't know when he passed.

14:01.550 --> 14:08.257
Describe the MSC and its activities for an impressionable young undergraduate.

14:10.159 --> 14:18.167
Well, one fellow in our outfit was a guy named Jim Gatlin.

14:18.187 --> 14:20.009
He was my sophomore roommate.

14:20.830 --> 14:22.532
He was in Singing Cadets.

14:23.457 --> 14:26.581
And so he was always going to MSC for practice.

14:27.803 --> 14:34.010
Don McGinty was involved with MSC directorate program and he got involved in things like that.

14:35.252 --> 14:42.962
And it seemed like the MSC was sort of the activity center.

14:45.245 --> 14:53.295
But to be honest with you, I don't think we realized it as openly as we do, you know, we did later on.

14:53.798 --> 15:00.007
There was just not, I remember we always had pictures taken over there and gatherings of various kinds and all of that.

15:00.909 --> 15:05.756
Was young J. Wayne Stark, did you meet him as an undergraduate?

15:05.776 --> 15:05.996
Sure did.

15:06.597 --> 15:07.078
Sure did.

15:07.398 --> 15:07.879
How so?

15:08.880 --> 15:15.971
Well, he was one of those guys that was always available and people could go by and visit with him.

15:16.171 --> 15:22.000
My freshman year, I guess I didn't get hooked in quite as quickly because I had to work.

15:23.043 --> 15:27.488
And I worked for Professor Robert Reed, who's in the oceanography department here.

15:28.589 --> 15:30.672
And I was a handyman for he and his wife.

15:31.192 --> 15:38.961
And I did everything from yard work to painting to window cleaning, anything that Mrs. Reed needed to do around the house.

15:39.722 --> 15:40.883
I made 50 cents an hour.

15:41.124 --> 15:42.725
I was going to ask, 50 cents an hour.

15:43.406 --> 15:49.013
And it was through Professor Reed that I found out about oceanography.

15:50.254 --> 15:51.936
And there was a class that

15:52.034 --> 16:05.532
People told us about and said, you know, if you take this one hour oceanography course that Dr. Reed teaches, they have a cruise that goes out into the Gulf for about five days.

16:06.994 --> 16:10.559
And so I asked Professor Reed about that and he said, oh yes.

16:10.779 --> 16:16.467
And he said, we'll take two freshmen and we'll take some upperclassmen and so forth.

16:17.168 --> 16:21.113
And so he schooled us on how to get chosen.

16:22.004 --> 16:31.734
He said, when I mention this and that we're going to be taking this cruise, and usually I think it was spring break time or Thanksgiving or something like that.

16:33.135 --> 16:41.864
And he said, you be sitting up on the front row and just be sure and raise your hand immediately when I start talking about it.

16:41.884 --> 16:49.152
And so Don Elledge and I, another man from, a guy from my outfit, we raised our hands and both got to go.

16:49.832 --> 16:51.454
And that was in 1955.

16:52.379 --> 17:05.033
And I still remember I had a picture of me looking out a porthole of this little 65-foot freshwater yacht that was about as wild a ride as you could ask for.

17:05.433 --> 17:07.696
It was made for the Great Lakes, not the Gulf of Mexico.

17:08.977 --> 17:15.384
And we were gone five days and I was seasick four and a half.

17:15.404 --> 17:20.530
And I lived on oranges and crackers basically for five days.

17:21.522 --> 17:33.278
But I have a picture of me looking out a porthole with earphones on, and it was when Elvis Presley had just come out with Jailhouse Rock, and we were listening to it out in the Gulf of Mexico, 1955.

17:38.306 --> 17:45.355
Did you get involved in MSC activities early in your... I did not get involved.

17:45.516 --> 17:48.660
I was, as I mentioned, I had to work.

17:49.366 --> 17:55.875
And between working my freshman year and church activities, I just didn't have the time to get involved.

17:56.916 --> 17:57.297
All right.

17:57.317 --> 18:00.020
Guyon Hall was still here.

18:00.200 --> 18:03.004
Did you and your buddies go to anything at Guyon Hall?

18:04.366 --> 18:06.909
Either on Friday or Saturday nights, we went to movies.

18:07.550 --> 18:09.513
And they were maybe a quarter.

18:10.895 --> 18:14.059
And I'll never forget, Guyon Hall had a wooden floor.

18:15.881 --> 18:17.263
And if a real...

18:17.834 --> 18:19.956
scary horror type movie came in.

18:20.197 --> 18:21.598
A lot of the guys would have dates.

18:22.099 --> 18:25.483
We didn't have dates our freshman year to speak of it all.

18:26.384 --> 18:31.049
But there was a gas line that was on the floor right beside the wall.

18:32.711 --> 18:38.377
And some upperclassmen or somebody would raise that up at a very scary moment and drop it.

18:39.578 --> 18:41.861
And boy, the girls would scream and holler and yell.

18:43.082 --> 18:46.626
But Guy and Hall was a good place to go watch a movie if you could stay awake.

18:47.382 --> 18:49.304
A lot of times you'd go to the movie and just fall asleep.

18:50.025 --> 18:52.288
But I still remember Guy and Hall.

18:53.389 --> 18:55.632
Now what else happened there other than movies?

18:56.814 --> 19:02.621
Well, oftentimes they would have an assemblage of the freshman class.

19:02.641 --> 19:07.507
And some of the bulls, the military brass, would come in and talk to us.

19:08.609 --> 19:11.432
Or some of the core staff would come in and talk to us.

19:11.969 --> 19:17.697
And it seemed to be sort of the meeting place for any assembly of the Corps.

19:20.802 --> 19:25.589
Let's see, chapel, were there any chapel services there?

19:26.671 --> 19:39.630
Yeah, there may have been, but I think most of them were an optional thing, and I don't have any recollection really of our ever going to a chapel service other than it was maybe some kind of a Thanksgiving program or something like that.

19:40.100 --> 19:47.310
Describe the, as you look back on it, describe the basic nature of the student body then.

19:47.370 --> 19:54.920
Attitudes, size town, where were Aggies from and what were they like?

19:56.422 --> 20:09.921
Well, the one thing that I felt A&M offered at that time that was very important was that with all of us wearing the same uniform,

20:10.475 --> 20:13.838
There seemed to be no class distinction.

20:15.359 --> 20:16.961
You could be from Highland Park.

20:18.062 --> 20:22.406
You could be from Spur, Texas, as I was.

20:23.046 --> 20:24.247
You could be from the Valley.

20:24.307 --> 20:26.189
You could be from Amarillo and the Panhandle.

20:26.990 --> 20:29.752
And by and large, we were all treated the same.

20:31.494 --> 20:38.440
And probably the only way you could tell if anybody had any money was the kind of car they drove.

20:39.230 --> 20:44.179
And we had some guys whose parents had money and therefore they drove a brand new car.

20:45.120 --> 20:55.499
So that was a mark of distinction that made us different, but yet it didn't, it was never one of those things that you were mad at a guy because he had a car.

20:56.340 --> 21:03.212
In fact, you liked him and wanted to be near him so you could drive his car or be with him.

21:04.306 --> 21:10.892
in terms of the term diversity today, how diverse was the student body then?

21:11.092 --> 21:17.479
Well, we did not have, to my knowledge, a black student among us.

21:19.000 --> 21:21.883
We had many Hispanics.

21:23.464 --> 21:26.587
One of the best known in our outfit was Carlos Peña.

21:27.588 --> 21:29.250
Carlos was from Catula.

21:29.590 --> 21:30.651
Peña?

21:31.222 --> 21:54.208
uh ea i think with a little hyphen above it and uh carlis was a uh he was our resident spic as you might call it and it was not an uncomplimentary term uh but he was one of us and he never ever was looked down upon because he was a mexican

21:55.319 --> 21:58.623
And he was just as much a one of us as anybody else.

21:59.084 --> 22:07.175
And then we had another gentleman by the name of Dimitri Pappas, who was Hispanic.

22:07.195 --> 22:11.440
And, you know, I can just think of any number of individuals.

22:11.481 --> 22:12.822
Pappas was Hispanic?

22:15.366 --> 22:16.447
No, he wasn't.

22:16.467 --> 22:17.128
Oh, was he?

22:17.368 --> 22:18.610
He was more Italian.

22:18.742 --> 22:20.646
Well, is this the Pappas family?

22:20.766 --> 22:23.231
No, it has nothing to do with the Pappas family there.

22:23.451 --> 22:24.113
Because they're Greek.

22:24.153 --> 22:25.095
They're Greek.

22:25.435 --> 22:26.958
They're Greek.

22:28.001 --> 22:38.742
But the Hispanics that we had were very proud, hardworking,

22:39.464 --> 22:43.449
individuals and they did well.

22:43.889 --> 22:44.750
What about Jewish?

22:45.531 --> 22:46.532
Were there some Jewish students?

22:46.572 --> 22:46.993
There were.

22:47.614 --> 22:53.801
We had one Jewish fellow by the name of Frank Weinberger in our outfit that was a sophomore.

22:54.842 --> 22:57.205
Did Jewish students have a nickname?

22:59.127 --> 22:59.367
No.

23:00.168 --> 23:06.936
And I was so naive that I didn't even know even by the name that a person was Jewish.

23:08.058 --> 23:08.458
I just

23:09.147 --> 23:14.353
I, you know, I didn't learn about that part of life until later on.

23:14.954 --> 23:17.336
I'm nodding because that would have described me too.

23:18.678 --> 23:21.701
Do you remember any international students?

23:23.483 --> 23:24.284
We had a few.

23:25.846 --> 23:28.529
We had a boy or two from South America.

23:28.869 --> 23:34.716
I can't recall names right now, but we had a few, not many.

23:35.843 --> 23:39.468
And usually it was because they had family members that had been here in the past.

23:39.768 --> 23:43.453
And basically the student body was from Texas.

23:44.455 --> 23:49.201
What about their attitudes, liberal, conservative, et cetera?

23:49.922 --> 23:56.711
Well, I think you would find the majority of them more conservative.

23:58.013 --> 24:04.281
I had two very good friends that I met at Junction that were from New York.

24:05.628 --> 24:07.830
And it was an oddity.

24:07.850 --> 24:11.154
Don Shearer was from Brooklyn.

24:11.174 --> 24:20.403
And a fellow by the name of Small, I can't remember his first name, but he was from Manhattan.

24:20.423 --> 24:25.808
And their accent is what gave them trouble.

24:26.649 --> 24:31.334
And, you know, they were hazed a lot by sophomores because of their accent.

24:31.354 --> 24:33.136
The rest of us were all Texans.

24:33.156 --> 24:34.437
Did they get a nickname?

24:34.822 --> 24:36.004
Do you remember?

24:36.364 --> 24:41.411
These two didn't that I know of, although they often were referred to as Yankees.

24:41.992 --> 24:42.993
Did you have a nickname?

24:44.456 --> 24:56.192
I had a nickname that came from high school and only my high school buddies, but I was known as Yo-Yo Joe because I had a yo-yo and I used to perform a lot of tricks with a yo-yo.

24:56.372 --> 24:57.574
And did that name get here?

24:58.375 --> 25:02.601
It did with a few of my friends.

25:04.319 --> 25:17.094
Let's see, student activity organizations, the singing cadets, the band and so forth, what were the major during all of your undergraduate years?

25:17.915 --> 25:27.627
Well, singing cadets, hometown clubs, we had societies that were, we had the marketing society.

25:28.231 --> 25:34.297
It was usually related to whatever your major was going to be, the Engineering Society, those kinds of things.

25:35.338 --> 25:42.166
But I don't recall anything other than that that we were too, you know, we were involved in.

25:42.186 --> 25:43.487
All right.

25:43.507 --> 25:46.350
What did you and your buddies think about the band?

25:48.392 --> 25:58.002
Well, I think the band was just so much a part of the Corps that we probably did not have

25:59.568 --> 26:04.636
an unusual positive or negative feeling.

26:04.656 --> 26:05.998
They were just guys in the Corps.

26:07.781 --> 26:08.642
That's all there was to it.

26:09.263 --> 26:14.230
And of all of the student leadership roles, which one had the highest prestige?

26:16.634 --> 26:19.819
Well, the cadet colonel of the Corps, no doubt about it.

26:20.640 --> 26:25.828
But because of my background, I always admired the Corps chaplain.

26:27.091 --> 26:41.845
And I thought he often had an opportunity to be in leadership roles at a lot of events because he was there to word a prayer or give something inspirational.

26:43.307 --> 26:45.369
And he was always in charge.

26:45.409 --> 26:49.893
We had a prayer before every meal at the dining hall.

26:49.953 --> 26:52.135
So I was always impressed with that.

26:52.376 --> 26:56.059
I wonder, are they still do that now?

26:56.079 --> 26:56.980
I believe they do.

26:57.247 --> 27:00.833
I believe they do, but I'm not for certain.

27:02.356 --> 27:06.823
And what was the prestige of the Ross Volunteers then?

27:07.404 --> 27:12.272
My freshman year, I couldn't have told you who the Ross Volunteers were, really.

27:13.294 --> 27:16.219
I had no real knowledge of who they were.

27:17.341 --> 27:19.845
Was there even a student body president then?

27:22.610 --> 27:24.512
Could have been, I don't know.

27:25.934 --> 27:28.057
We had some class officers, I remember that.

27:28.818 --> 27:36.327
If there was someone to speak for the student body, it was the corps commander?

27:37.128 --> 27:38.990
More often than not, it was the corps commander.

27:40.171 --> 27:47.200
And when you students looked at the administration then, who were the key administrators in your undergraduate days?

27:49.829 --> 27:53.493
Well, there were probably more of us that knew who Pinky Downs was.

27:54.194 --> 27:54.755
Describe him.

27:54.815 --> 27:57.578
Than anybody else.

27:58.820 --> 28:02.764
I doubt that we even knew the president or anybody else.

28:02.905 --> 28:06.028
We knew the upperclassmen in our outfit.

28:06.128 --> 28:08.631
We knew who the military brass was.

28:09.012 --> 28:10.634
We knew who the commandant was.

28:12.136 --> 28:19.144
And, you know, there was a fellow by the name of Pelley Dittman from the Air Force that was our

28:19.580 --> 28:45.520
corps commandant but all of a sudden one time I was over at the MSC and we were having a cup of coffee or visiting or something and somebody said well there's Pinky Downs and we looked up and here came this gentleman with his hat in his hand he had glasses on a wiry looking little fella and somebody spoke to him and he just came over and started talking to us

28:46.782 --> 28:50.727
And he was sort of the spokesperson for A&M.

28:51.748 --> 28:55.053
And he was just, he was just always around over at the MSC.

28:55.133 --> 28:57.276
And everywhere you'd look, there'd be pinky downs.

28:58.257 --> 29:02.202
And at Yale practice, you'd see pinky downs and various things.

29:03.143 --> 29:13.617
One of my wonderful remembrances of freshman activities again that was unusual was Yale practice.

29:15.048 --> 29:39.790
You know, in high school I was a football player, and we had pep rallies, as they were called, but it was hard for us to understand the meaning of yell practice, but we gathered in the Grove and had yell practice on Tuesday nights, and then again on Friday nights, and sometimes even on Thursday nights.

29:40.681 --> 29:49.332
But I have a picture of some of my freshman buddies and myself on top of the grove with our outfit sign hanging down.

29:50.493 --> 30:00.947
And it was an interesting event because whoever thought that you'd go to college to learn how to yell.

30:02.669 --> 30:03.550
But we did it.

30:04.660 --> 30:09.728
As far as you people knew, what was Mr. Downs, what was Pinky's role?

30:09.788 --> 30:12.792
What was his task?

30:12.812 --> 30:20.705
Well, I don't know that we understood what his task was other than he was just an encourager.

30:21.866 --> 30:25.732
He believed in A&M, and he just went around telling everybody what a great place it was.

30:26.994 --> 30:30.820
And, you know, he motivated us to want to be better.

30:33.922 --> 30:39.690
The, when you went back and forth, describe getting from Macaulay Station to Spur.

30:42.033 --> 30:50.685
Well, that first semester, it was usually by hitchhiking, and we found that if you wore your uniform, you got rides a lot easier.

30:53.268 --> 30:59.777
You learned about the hitchhiking, hitchhiking place at Northgate.

31:00.770 --> 31:04.435
And you didn't get up there and upstage anybody that was already there.

31:04.495 --> 31:09.562
You lined up and there was a pecking order of people.

31:09.962 --> 31:11.024
And you said Northgate?

31:11.204 --> 31:11.444
Yes.

31:11.765 --> 31:12.045
Where?

31:12.906 --> 31:16.491
It was right over kind of in front of the post office area right there.

31:16.531 --> 31:22.819
And there was sort of a canopy-like awning there to kind of keep the rain off of people.

31:23.480 --> 31:28.026
But you just got out there in your uniform and you'd start hitchhiking.

31:28.495 --> 31:32.700
Sometimes you'd get on and out on the highway, and that might be better.

31:32.780 --> 31:41.650
But normally, Northgate, because what was happening was there was a lot of guys that were going somewhere at that given time.

31:42.852 --> 31:45.695
And if you didn't have a ride, that's kind of where you lined up.

31:46.656 --> 31:52.202
Sometimes if you got a ride with another Aggie, were you expected to help pay for the gas?

31:53.384 --> 31:57.068
No, not necessarily.

31:58.128 --> 32:02.313
One of my most embarrassing moments took place my freshman year.

32:04.696 --> 32:07.739
My roommate and I, Don McGinty, were going to hitchhike into Bryan.

32:08.780 --> 32:11.203
And of course, that was five miles, roughly.

32:12.324 --> 32:14.247
And so we were at Northgate hitchhiking.

32:15.648 --> 32:22.656
And we got this ride with this guy that was stationed out at Bryan Air Force Base.

32:23.557 --> 32:25.840
We didn't know that he was an Aggie.

32:27.136 --> 32:33.182
And we failed to whip out as you're supposed to and introduce yourselves.

32:33.202 --> 32:36.905
And by the time we got to Brian, he said, well, what outfit are you fellows in?

32:38.227 --> 32:39.648
And we said, well, we're in Squadron 4.

32:40.309 --> 32:44.372
And he said, who is your first sergeant?

32:45.834 --> 32:47.876
And we told him.

32:47.896 --> 32:51.459
And he said, well, who is your corps commander?

32:51.920 --> 32:53.661
We told him.

32:53.681 --> 32:55.523
And this was on a Saturday.

32:57.443 --> 33:13.421
Sunday afternoon, we were summoned to the first sergeant's office, a room, and he said, well, gentlemen, I understand you've met Mr. So-and-so.

33:14.683 --> 33:18.727
Did you know that he was CO of this outfit just a couple of years ago?

33:21.150 --> 33:25.695
And we said no, and he said, you were about two of the rudest passengers he's ever had.

33:27.127 --> 33:36.297
And we sat in David Fawcett's room with John D. Cunningham, his roommate, and we sat on a hanger.

33:36.558 --> 33:47.650
I don't know whether you've ever seen this process, but you take a regular coat hanger and put the hook part on the floor, and you squat down on the top of it and hold it in place.

33:50.354 --> 33:52.476
And you try that for about three hours.

33:53.941 --> 33:59.067
and you just can hardly walk by the time you finish.

33:59.107 --> 34:09.380
We were just soaking wet, we had sweated clear through our uniforms, but never again did we fail to properly introduce ourselves when we got a ride.

34:11.042 --> 34:15.047
But riding, getting home was always an adventure.

34:15.468 --> 34:20.054
About how long did it take to get to Spur, hitchhiking?

34:20.434 --> 34:23.458
It would probably take 10 to 12 hours.

34:24.923 --> 34:26.405
It was 325 miles.

34:28.227 --> 34:31.652
Sometimes you'd get a ride all the way to Abilene and it was just another 100 miles.

34:32.613 --> 34:40.263
But I can remember some nights standing out in the cold wind waiting on a ride.

34:41.004 --> 34:43.707
Did you ever have a bad experience hitchhiking?

34:43.727 --> 34:44.088
Never did.

34:44.869 --> 34:45.890
Did you ever hear of any?

34:45.910 --> 34:47.392
I have not yet heard of single.

34:47.892 --> 34:51.437
No, I don't recall a time of hearing.

34:52.700 --> 34:59.371
I've heard of people driving fast and maybe the driver having drunk a little too much, but no wrecks.

34:59.511 --> 35:01.173
No, no, I never heard of a wreck.

35:01.253 --> 35:04.178
Nobody trying to rob them or take advantage of them.

35:04.318 --> 35:10.829
And there was an occasion when we were with, I was riding with a man once that I felt like they had a little too much to drink and he let me drive.

35:11.990 --> 35:13.573
And, you know, I enjoyed that.

35:14.615 --> 35:16.157
How often did you go home?

35:17.940 --> 35:20.023
I only went home twice the first semester.

35:21.691 --> 35:22.192
That was it.

35:22.872 --> 35:23.954
One of those was Thanksgiving?

35:23.974 --> 35:27.538
One of those was Thanksgiving.

35:27.558 --> 35:31.203
And you didn't have a car until?

35:31.223 --> 35:34.907
I did not have a car until I came back the second semester.

35:34.927 --> 35:36.309
Oh, the second semester you brought your car.

35:36.630 --> 35:37.651
How did life change?

35:39.393 --> 35:43.238
Well, it changed dramatically.

35:43.258 --> 35:45.100
I all of a sudden had a lot of friends.

35:45.788 --> 35:49.754
And, of course, this was a car that I had paid for in high school, so it was mine.

35:50.095 --> 35:51.216
It was not my parents' car.

35:51.296 --> 35:51.977
I had worked for it.

35:53.299 --> 36:03.715
And it allowed me to more readily work for the Reeds because I didn't have to ride a bicycle over to their house, and I got to drive my car.

36:06.099 --> 36:11.307
Having my own car, though, was a very embarrassing, there was one very embarrassing incident.

36:13.598 --> 36:24.690
Parking lot past Duncan Dining Hall way down at the south end of the campus was a graveled lot that we affectionately referred to as the Navasota lot.

36:26.272 --> 36:31.338
And it just had gravel and some little barriers around the edges of it.

36:31.618 --> 36:34.902
And that's where freshmen were privileged to park if you had a car.

36:36.464 --> 36:39.387
Well, I parked there one Friday afternoon.

36:40.868 --> 36:46.913
I was, I had a date with a girl in Bryan, and I was so excited about having a date.

36:47.814 --> 36:49.636
So I rode my bicycle down.

36:51.577 --> 36:55.041
You had to have your tie on and leave the campus class A uniform.

36:55.501 --> 36:58.784
If you got caught without a tie on, you were in trouble.

36:58.804 --> 37:05.490
So I rode my bicycle down, parked it in front of my car that was, but another car headed into it.

37:07.331 --> 37:10.234
And so I was putting my tie on.

37:11.868 --> 37:16.074
The person in the car in front of me drove his car off.

37:16.094 --> 37:23.885
And I got so excited, in the meantime, putting my tie on, getting ready to go, and my bicycle had fallen over.

37:24.887 --> 37:26.449
I ran over my own bicycle.

37:27.851 --> 37:30.114
And so I put the three pieces of it in the trunk.

37:31.396 --> 37:37.004
And my three-speed bicycle was no longer, and I sold it for $5 for parts.

37:38.246 --> 37:40.609
Haven't told many people that, but it was a,

37:40.741 --> 37:43.004
It was a humorous thing that happened to me.

37:43.986 --> 37:48.633
Did sophomores or other upperclassmen give you a hard time about having a car?

37:49.714 --> 37:49.995
No.

37:50.956 --> 38:00.310
I found out all of a sudden that I became a very popular freshman when I had a car because they oftentimes wanted to borrow my car.

38:01.292 --> 38:06.900
And I had to be very, very careful because my dad said, you don't want to do that.

38:07.724 --> 38:34.305
uh life on an all-male campus in terms of meeting young ladies getting dates and so forth describe that facet of being well that was one of the great advantages of going to church there were some local young ladies who were the the offspring of faculty members staff members and

38:34.589 --> 38:42.001
You had an opportunity to meet them in a setting other than academic.

38:42.021 --> 38:48.632
And then the other source of good contacts was guys who had sisters.

38:50.235 --> 38:54.202
And you'd go home with them on weekends and you'd get to date their sister.

38:55.323 --> 39:01.153
And I had a good buddy by the name of John Alterman and he had a twin sister named Kitty.

39:02.382 --> 39:04.884
and I had an opportunity to date her.

39:06.286 --> 39:16.556
But there were two girls in Bryan by the name of McElroy, and their father was ag prof here and worked with the USDA.

39:17.617 --> 39:28.407
And I, you know, became their good friends more than just dating, but I was invited to their home many a time, and we'd eat meals there, and it was just great fun.

39:29.146 --> 39:41.468
Now, somebody the other day mentioned the Bryan 200 or something or other, some number like that, that in their era there was a group supposedly, and these were supposed to be the people of status.

39:42.109 --> 39:48.420
That number didn't... I didn't ring any bells with me because that was probably much...

39:49.784 --> 39:53.629
Beyond my interest in those days, I didn't have any interest in.

39:53.850 --> 39:59.157
All right, now did you meet, while you were still an undergraduate, a young lady that you would spend the rest of your life with?

40:00.058 --> 40:06.407
I did not meet my wife, Joanne, until my junior year.

40:06.587 --> 40:07.248
And how did you?

40:08.049 --> 40:10.653
And I met her at church.

40:11.874 --> 40:16.821
She was a high school senior and an excellent ping pong player.

40:17.476 --> 40:25.047
And I admired her ability to handle just about anybody at a ping pong table.

40:25.067 --> 40:32.178
And her father was in the math department here, Lawrence Nolan, N-O-L-E-N.

40:33.280 --> 40:46.099
And she was going to school at Abilene, Abilene Christian College, as it was then called, for her freshman year, which was my junior year.

40:46.957 --> 41:02.043
And an Aggie buddy of mine, I was dating a girl that was going to school there, and I got him a date with Joanne, but I found out that I should have been dating her.

41:02.063 --> 41:08.374
So we went to summer school the next summer and met, got married end of my junior year.

41:09.256 --> 41:09.336
Hmm.

41:10.649 --> 41:13.133
All right, then that's a special facet.

41:13.193 --> 41:16.017
What was it like then to be a, you were a married senior?

41:16.758 --> 41:16.998
Yes.

41:17.139 --> 41:19.582
What was it like to be a married senior at A&M?

41:21.205 --> 41:32.121
Well, it was so different you can't imagine it because you had freedom to come and go as you pleased.

41:33.322 --> 41:38.210
We rented a little house over at Southgate from Mrs. and Mr. R.L.

41:38.290 --> 41:38.530
Hunt.

41:39.927 --> 41:43.330
And they had a little house that was probably 20 by 20.

41:44.571 --> 41:48.375
And we rented it for $50 a month with all utilities paid.

41:49.916 --> 42:00.927
And I remember how many of the guys in my outfit that were seniors that would come over and have a meal with us, visit.

42:00.947 --> 42:06.812
And it was just totally, totally different.

42:08.142 --> 42:13.369
And so she did not finish her degree at that time?

42:14.150 --> 42:14.430
No.

42:15.252 --> 42:17.975
She had a year at Abilene Christian.

42:18.736 --> 42:26.767
She had been here to two summer sessions and then decided that Sam Houston State was just much closer.

42:28.129 --> 42:34.858
So she enrolled at Sam Houston State after we'd gone to summer school that summer.

42:36.847 --> 42:46.890
Anyway, then we married in January of 57, 58, excuse me, January of 58.

42:47.360 --> 42:58.716
I had changed majors a couple of times, as I mentioned, from engineering to architecture to business, so I needed one more semester here, and so I graduated then in January of 59.

43:01.560 --> 43:05.946
Let's go back to a much less serious item.

43:07.508 --> 43:14.237
Court trips as a, before you were married, describe court trips, out-of-town games.

43:16.200 --> 43:17.181
I remember,

43:17.482 --> 43:22.328
court trips as a fun experience.

43:22.428 --> 43:30.719
The upperclassmen would always give us great advice, said whatever you do, stay in uniform and stay in groups.

43:32.301 --> 43:41.232
And so I remember one time we went to play SMU and we were at the Colisee, I mean at the Cotton Bowl where they were, the game was being played.

43:41.632 --> 43:46.999
And of course the carnival atmosphere around

43:47.367 --> 43:50.491
there was something on Friday night that we wanted to be a part of.

43:50.591 --> 43:55.758
And so we went out, and I'll never forget, they said, whatever you do, stay together.

43:56.459 --> 43:57.720
Don't go off by yourself.

43:58.581 --> 44:00.063
And so we just had a blast.

44:00.183 --> 44:01.685
We had a good time.

44:03.347 --> 44:08.154
TCU was one of those that got in a big fight after the game.

44:08.674 --> 44:11.458
A lot of the Corps members were attacking.

44:11.478 --> 44:12.379
It was kind of a...

44:12.747 --> 44:18.595
melee of activities but by and large court trips were a lot of fun.

44:19.096 --> 44:23.202
Now how did you normally how did you go on the court trip?

44:23.222 --> 44:34.618
We went in somebody's car as a you know you provided your own transportation and usually you would stay in the homes of buddies that lived in Fort Worth, Dallas, Houston or wherever.

44:35.339 --> 44:39.885
Do you remember any good one-of-a-kind story from a court trip?

44:41.401 --> 44:50.791
Yeah, it wasn't my freshman year, but I guess it was the end of my sophomore year maybe.

44:50.871 --> 44:55.616
I think that's when it was, the fall of the sophomore year.

44:56.818 --> 45:03.605
We played TCU in a football game and we had dates with some girls from Dallas.

45:05.447 --> 45:09.231
And so we went to a fellow

45:09.667 --> 45:11.369
Aggie's home after the game.

45:11.449 --> 45:14.874
We had beaten TCU, as I recall, and we had a party.

45:16.496 --> 45:20.861
It was one of those that lasted until 1.30 or 2 o'clock in the morning.

45:21.262 --> 45:27.169
And so we were driving back to take these girls home after the game to Dallas.

45:29.312 --> 45:39.505
And lo and behold, I was asked to stop by a local policeman because we were going too fast.

45:40.278 --> 45:53.213
And I honestly believe that the fact that we were Aggies in uniform and this guy was an Aggie, that he didn't give us a ticket.

45:53.574 --> 45:56.557
And we deserved a ticket because we were driving too fast.

45:56.577 --> 45:57.678
But it was 2 o'clock in the morning.

45:58.900 --> 46:02.064
But there was no alcohol involved and so he was very kind.

46:03.065 --> 46:05.808
And he said, wasn't that a great victory that the Aggies had?

46:06.989 --> 46:10.133
And so he said, y'all slow it down a little bit.

46:10.248 --> 46:10.969
And that was it.

46:11.629 --> 46:12.650
So I've always remembered that.

46:15.573 --> 46:22.939
In that era, what did, what were the student indulgences?

46:24.381 --> 46:30.666
What did they eat, drink, smoke?

46:30.686 --> 46:38.213
Well, we always had outfit parties and

46:38.750 --> 46:47.141
I guess to some degree there was always plenty of alcohol available, especially in the form of beer.

46:48.423 --> 46:54.431
And a lot of the guys just, we'd usually go out to the clay pits.

46:54.451 --> 46:56.954
That was a popular place to have outfit parties.

46:57.675 --> 46:59.918
You know, that's down Welburn Road to the west.

46:59.938 --> 47:01.360
Down Welburn Road and back to the west.

47:02.601 --> 47:06.867
And there seemed to be

47:07.792 --> 47:18.072
A few guys that would just get totally loaded, and many of us who did not participate, we were the drivers and brought them all back.
