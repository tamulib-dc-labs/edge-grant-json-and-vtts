WEBVTT

00:01.702 --> 00:04.004
You can remember only maybe two or three. We had a 
guy named Rodney Gott, whose

00:05.025 --> 00:19.298
father was

00:05.025 --> 00:19.298
president of I think the American Foundry or 
something like that. And he used to come up in a

00:19.318 --> 00:27.065
great big long Cadillac.

00:27.906 --> 00:30.628
And we had maybe two or three others that that were 
in that category, but otherwise why you had

00:30.997 --> 00:50.305
individuals who were from the coal mines of West 
Virginia and who hadn't even had graduated from

00:30.997 --> 00:50.305
high school. Really? You had some students who 
were your colleagues that hadn't graduated from

00:50.726 --> 00:54.832
high school? They'd gone to one of these prep 
schools. Oh, I see. Prep to be able to pass exams,

00:59.752 --> 01:03.838
Joe Remus. And

01:03.858 --> 01:09.026
of course, he worked all the time. I mean, he 
studied all the time. But he got through.

01:15.997 --> 01:20.224
And Tom Kilday was another one from Texas. And then 
we had another classmate from Bonham, Texas.

01:31.156 --> 01:35.522
and then we had Cam Longley from a little small town 
up in West Texas. So,

01:37.505 --> 01:58.193
other than the people were from the northeast, 
why, and you, see you didn't have any

01:37.505 --> 01:58.193
fraternization with these people because see, 
when you entered the military academy in July in

01:37.505 --> 01:58.193
29, the first time that you were permitted to get a 
leave was 18 months later. I mean, you had a

02:04.365 --> 02:14.918
Christmas vacation, and then after your 
sophomore year, between your sophomore year and

02:04.365 --> 02:14.918
your junior year, you came home. I came to Texas. 
That was the only time I came back to Texas. During

02:19.063 --> 02:20.925
the time, and then your parents don't come up. I 
mean, it's too expensive to come up. And most of

02:23.909 --> 02:26.052
these people, you never see your parents. And so 
you don't, you don't associate an individual that

02:29.999 --> 02:58.555
he's a son of a millionaire or, because you never, 
you wear the same clothes, you have the same

02:29.999 --> 02:58.555
allowances, you can't, they're not supposed to 
give you any money, and you're supposed to earn

02:29.999 --> 02:58.555
all, you have a bank account type of thing, and you 
buy your books and your clothing, and get your

02:59.395 --> 03:04.842
cadet store type of activities all out of your own 
little bank account. You just wrote checks for

03:04.862 --> 03:06.224
these things. So everybody was treated exactly 
the same. Did you like that aspect of your

03:09.928 --> 03:12.271
education? I was for that because I didn't have to 
worry about finances. No, I mean the fact that

03:17.918 --> 03:19.941
everybody was treated the same. Well, you didn't 
really think about it. I mean, I don't think you

03:23.465 --> 03:25.588
really gave it a lot of thought. You just accepted 
it. You just accepted it. And you didn't object to

03:28.824 --> 03:31.186
it. I mean, that's the way it was. If you want to stay 
there, that's where you abide by the rules and

03:33.668 --> 03:37.672
regulations. And as far as standing in conduct,

03:37.692 --> 03:50.242
I guess I was a complier type. I mean, I wasn't the 
one that was not, didn't comply with the

03:58.373 --> 04:00.937
regulations. Whatever the regulations were, 
that was for me. Now you talked about at A&M Corps,

04:05.826 --> 04:13.318
there was a Spreedy Corps, was that same feeling, 
that same spirit at West Point? Yeah, oh yeah. In

04:13.999 --> 04:16.263
larger or less dose, or could you compare it? Oh, I 
would say certainly about equal. And of course, I

04:21.239 --> 04:41.545
think that the cadet who goes to Texas A&M, who 
spends four years there and gets to know all of his

04:21.239 --> 04:41.545
classmates,

04:21.239 --> 04:41.545
I think he gets the same outlook, the same suite of 
core as you do at the military academy.

04:43.487 --> 04:48.293
And the fact that you know everybody, you know the 
people who are playing football,

04:50.433 --> 04:52.115
And I played football. You played football at West 
Point? Oh, yeah. I was on about the third team. I

04:57.903 --> 04:59.406
passed. I caught half. You were an end? I was an end. 
I sat on the seat on the bench before 110,000 in

05:02.750 --> 05:08.678
Soldier's Field. I caught passes between halves. 
Oh, you'd get in the game before you got 50 ahead or

05:11.783 --> 05:17.931
something of that sort. And... And I was on the 
boxing team, and I played lacrosse.

05:25.502 --> 05:28.045
Were sports emphasized at West Point? Well, 
football, yes. I would say that football, I would

05:32.809 --> 05:48.402
say your first team at that time in football were

05:32.809 --> 05:48.402
individuals who had already made a name for 
themselves at some college, like Chris Cagle,

05:49.107 --> 05:54.173
Some of them were all Americans before they went to 
military academy. So

05:54.553 --> 06:09.051
football, but basketball, boxing, fencing, 
swimming, there

05:54.553 --> 06:09.051
are certain things that you had to do. You had to 
learn how to swim. So there's certain types of

06:13.998 --> 06:18.445
athletes you had to learn how to fence. You also had 
to learn how to box. And

06:22.551 --> 06:31.144
there's certain intramural athletes that you had 
to participate in and become proficient in. Why

06:32.687 --> 06:34.610
fencing? Well, it's one of these,

06:34.630 --> 06:42.081
I guess, graceful skills that you that you

06:43.208 --> 06:47.713
participate in. That was one of the programs that 
you had to take sometime during your four year

06:48.193 --> 07:01.287
period. Now, here is a Texan from a small town who 
had never been out of Texas before arriving on the

07:09.837 --> 07:11.719
Hudson River in New York. What were your 
impressions of New England? Well, I met Tom

07:15.104 --> 07:19.209
Kilday. He was from San Antonio, I think. So I'd 
gotten in touch with him, and I'd met him at

07:24.655 --> 07:34.107
Franklin, Texas, and I boarded the same train that 
he

07:35.369 --> 07:39.995
He had already been four years in college. He did? 
Yeah, he had already been. He had graduated from

07:42.459 --> 07:46.264
St. Edward's before he had gone to military 
academy. So I met him there and we went to St. Louis

07:47.245 --> 08:03.267
and then St. Louis to New York and spent the night in 
New York and then caught the train up from New York.

08:04.141 --> 08:12.313
I had him to follow around and we didn't tarry 
anywhere until we got to the military cabin. Of

08:12.634 --> 08:33.405
course you were met at the station and by the time 
you got up on the

08:12.634 --> 08:33.405
military reservation there was a bunch of cadets 
around you making you pick up your baggage, drop

08:12.634 --> 08:33.405
it, pick it up, drop it. this type of thing. They 
started from there to indoctrinate you to obey

08:34.553 --> 08:40.039
commands.

08:46.907 --> 08:47.307
I don't know. Did you like New England versus 
Texas? Well, New England is a very puritano type of

08:51.672 --> 08:58.480
country. I mean, it's a really pretty country, 
particularly in the fall, particularly in the

08:58.540 --> 09:03.325
springtime. And, of course, we went up there in 
July. And it, of course, was pretty at the time. I

09:16.716 --> 09:21.223
don't really have any thoughts as far as leaving. 
I'd say the train ride from Reagan, Texas to Tyler

09:21.263 --> 09:30.477
was a lot more impressive because that's the first 
time you'd ever been away from home. And you really

09:31.233 --> 09:34.077
had to spend very many nights away from home. Sure. 
And getting on a train with,

09:35.138 --> 09:42.307
you remember that type of thing. But as far as the 
train ride from Texas to West Point, really I don't

09:42.347 --> 09:50.157
remember too much about it. Okay, now let's talk 
for a minute about the, after you graduated from

09:50.177 --> 09:58.607
West Point and received your commission as the 
second lieutenant, and later on in your military

09:58.992 --> 10:15.329
career, what was your opinion as a West Point 
graduate of the commissioned officers who had

09:58.992 --> 10:15.329
received their training from Texas A&M?

10:15.349 --> 10:25.860
Well, there's been a lot of comment, I'd say, that 
the West Pointers were were stuck up and always got

10:27.258 --> 10:30.462
the best jobs. Yeah, I heard that quite a bit. I 
don't really think that that is true in the Air

10:32.785 --> 10:36.671
Force. When I graduated from the Military 
Academy, I ranked 66 out of 346. And

10:43.520 --> 10:54.835
had I ranked a little higher, I wanted the Corps of 
Engineers. And I think the Corps of Engineers

10:56.300 --> 11:04.170
quota went down to about 56, because everybody 
didn't select the Corps of Engineers. But you got

11:04.810 --> 11:11.599
your, you selected your branch of service by how 
you ranked. The number of guys ranked number one,

11:11.639 --> 11:14.863
he got his choice. Ranked number two, number 
three, and on down to 66. Well, then I had to select

11:18.207 --> 11:21.391
the Coastal Artillery. I selected the Coastal 
Artillery as my choice, except Then you had to wait

11:26.624 --> 11:33.451
two years after you graduated from the Military 
Academy to transfer to the Corps of Engineers. So I

11:34.713 --> 11:47.206
said, well, I'll just take the Air Corps

11:34.713 --> 11:47.206
because I did pass the physical. And then that'll 
be one year while you learn to fly, and then you just

11:48.908 --> 11:55.635
have one more year to wait until you could go to the 
Corps of Engineers. And of course I was basically

11:59.878 --> 12:09.369
I'm sure back to the architectural construction 
type of business that I was really interested in.

12:10.950 --> 12:22.983
And then I passed the physical exam so everybody 
who passed the physical exam could come to the

12:10.950 --> 12:22.983
flying school. And of course

12:26.328 --> 12:39.806
The flying school is a great equalizer as far as 
people are concerned because some of them, about

12:26.328 --> 12:39.806
50% of them, graduated from flying school and 50% 
didn't. And so when you graduate from the flying

12:40.186 --> 12:47.796
school, I would say that a very small proportion, I 
don't know exactly what it would be, but I would say

12:49.143 --> 13:01.982
certainly less than 25% of the officer corps were 
military graduates. You mean West Point

13:02.002 --> 13:03.224
graduates? Yeah, West Point graduates. And the 
rest of them were from Texas A&M, et cetera. And I

13:10.715 --> 13:15.943
know in the Air Force you really didn't look to see 
Of course you knew who your classmates were and of

13:16.565 --> 13:23.893
course, but very seldom were you ever stationed 
with your classmates. Most of the people that you

13:23.913 --> 13:30.281
had around you were non-graduates

13:23.913 --> 13:30.281
of the military academy. They were graduates of 
Texas A&M or almost any college. And

13:36.708 --> 13:44.277
you very seldom run into any animosity between 
graduates and non-graduates. I think probably

13:50.937 --> 14:12.189
General Powers, who commanded SAC later,

13:50.937 --> 14:12.189
when I was in SAC in 56, 57, 58, did I run into the fact 
that he objected to military academy graduates.

14:12.209 --> 14:14.432
He was a non-military graduate. But otherwise, I 
don't think it affected you at all. Because I've

14:20.773 --> 14:31.751
heard from some A&M graduates that a West Point 
graduate is more conceited, more haughty. And

14:32.112 --> 14:36.138
just for a couple of years, they were more 
clannish. And for a couple of years, it was rather

14:38.729 --> 14:44.979
difficult to get along, if you were both second 
lieutenants, to get along with a West Point man.

14:45.039 --> 14:48.264
Now after that, they say it doesn't seem to make 
much difference. What do you think about that?

14:53.132 --> 15:06.272
Well, I think really your problem there is that 
when you graduate from the Kelly and arrive at your

15:06.556 --> 15:10.802
first base at, say, Fort Island, Luke Field. Of 
course, you have about five or maybe five people

15:11.884 --> 15:19.475
who report in at the same time. You know them. 
You've been talking to them for the last five

15:20.156 --> 15:25.223
years, four years or five years. Your classmates 
that arrived at Randolph and went to the same class

15:32.358 --> 15:40.408
with you at Randolph and Kelly, of course you've 
only known them for one year. And I think normally

15:40.929 --> 15:51.862
and naturally why you talk and you congregate with 
the people that you've known so long. And they've

15:52.944 --> 15:55.487
been your friends for that long. But after that, 
why...

16:02.513 --> 16:10.502
Well, by 1940, a lot of times I would be the only West 
Point graduate on the base. I would have saved 400

16:10.542 --> 16:13.045
officers.

16:19.373 --> 16:19.933
I don't know. In your opinion, which institution, 
A&M or West Point, produces a better caliber of

16:20.714 --> 16:27.222
officer?

16:35.572 --> 16:38.296
Well, I would say it's really hard to say. I would 
say it's really hard to say. I think it really

16:40.118 --> 16:43.242
depends upon the individual. I think it really 
depends on the individual as to how he reacts to

16:44.684 --> 16:52.995
situations.

16:57.421 --> 17:04.110
The units that I commanded the air divisions by You 
couldn't really distinguish between a Texas A&M

17:05.002 --> 17:11.750
graduate and a West Point graduate. Would you say 
the same thing as far as which institution

17:11.770 --> 17:18.819
produces a leader, that it depends more on the 
individual? I would say it really depends on the

17:19.900 --> 17:24.586
individual. I don't really think West Point makes 
a leader. I mean, I think they're too regimented. I

17:29.532 --> 17:34.198
think they're really very regimentated. as far as 
they do all the thinking for you. Whereas I think

17:39.058 --> 17:51.735
that if you probably get more thinkers

17:39.058 --> 17:51.735
that attend outside colleges. Does A&M make 
leaders? Well, I don't think that through your

17:56.021 --> 18:02.650
college years that you really produce any 
leaders. I really don't think that, I think it's

18:03.490 --> 18:25.391
really after you get out of college, maybe the 
course is, well it's very difficult to, in a

18:03.490 --> 18:25.391
classroom of descriptive geometry or chemistry, 
say this guy's going to be a leader and this guy's

18:03.490 --> 18:25.391
not going to be a leader. There's no way of 
distinguishing.

18:29.595 --> 18:32.097
All you're doing is teaching a guy how to think. OK. 
Now, not only are we talking about two different

18:32.633 --> 18:40.343
types of institutions that produces officers. 
We've been talking about West Point. We've been

18:42.225 --> 18:46.751
talking about the core schools like Texas A&M. And 
of course, we could also mention VMI and Virginia

18:46.771 --> 18:50.536
Tech. What about the ROTC schools? What about all 
the other land grant schools that have ROTC

18:53.099 --> 18:57.285
programs? What did you think of the caliber of 
those ROTC graduates?

19:03.532 --> 19:09.280
Well, I really never had an opportunity to 
compare. You really don't think of, when you look

19:09.761 --> 19:29.370
at Captain Joe Blow, whether or not he's a graduate 
of Texas A&M or SMU or Houston or wherever they have

19:09.761 --> 19:29.370
an ROTC program, you really look at him as an 
individual. and whether or not he's willing to

19:30.177 --> 19:40.508
accept responsibility and whether or not he's a 
pusher or whether or not he's a follower or

19:30.177 --> 19:40.508
whatever. So you really don't sit down and compare 
individuals.

19:51.220 --> 19:56.286
Now, in my master's thesis, I made a study of 100 
commanders, base commanders, wing commanders,

19:56.772 --> 20:03.761
division commanders, as to the type of education 
that they had. What did you find? Well, you found

20:07.406 --> 20:14.356
that about a third of them didn't have any college 
education at all. And yet they had been selected by

20:15.858 --> 20:20.404
somebody as being a commander. And I made a study of 
on whether or not they had graduated from a

20:28.683 --> 20:39.079
professional school in the military, whether or 
not the Air Command Staff School, Air War College,

20:28.683 --> 20:39.079
National War College, Industrial College. And 
again, a third of them had been to no professional

20:40.000 --> 20:46.870
school in the Air Force, 34 percent.

20:51.958 --> 20:53.760
What did you conclude? Well, I concluded that

21:01.572 --> 21:04.056
Well, it's hard to conclude anything, really. You 
look at the graduates of the National War College,

21:04.096 --> 21:25.133
one of the individuals who was selected for 
attending the National War College, and only

21:04.096 --> 21:25.133
about 2% of the officer corps

21:04.096 --> 21:25.133
were going to attend the National War College. 
Normally, as I remember, about 60% of those became

21:25.450 --> 21:30.377
a general officer. But see, you were selecting the 
top, theoretically, the top 2% of the officer

21:30.417 --> 21:37.848
corps anyway to go to school. So a large percentage 
of them normally would go. High probability that

21:41.313 --> 21:42.214
they would go. That they would go. And

21:44.457 --> 21:53.871
I really think that you really don't have to go to 
college to become a military leader. I think you

21:58.826 --> 22:16.584
just have to have that knack of handling people and 
being able to have ideas and be decisive and get

21:58.826 --> 22:16.584
willing to rock the boat. So as far as comparing 
graduates various colleges. I don't think it, I

22:25.652 --> 22:32.963
don't think you really, I really had an 
opportunity to look at each individual.

22:35.587 --> 22:37.390
You did make an interesting statement though. You 
said that men at West Point were

22:37.430 --> 22:52.393
not as, did you say not as likely to have ideas as 
ROTC graduates or something like something to

22:37.430 --> 22:52.393
that extent? Well, during your college years at 
West Point, I would say that now I'm going to

22:52.593 --> 23:04.311
understand they've changed the curriculum now so 
that you have a lot of choice. When I went there, you

23:05.152 --> 23:07.436
didn't have a choice. You just took this course and 
out of this book, and this is the way it's to be

23:07.456 --> 23:14.687
taught. And

23:14.767 --> 23:19.815
you didn't... didn't even read a newspaper. So to 
me why

23:22.158 --> 23:40.339
you learn a lot more in going to school and decide 
what courses you're going to take and how you're

23:22.158 --> 23:40.339
going to make the money to go to college. And

23:40.439 --> 23:47.507
I would say that would certainly improve your 
ability to

23:47.707 --> 23:57.413
make a success, whether or not it's in the military 
or whether or not it's in civilian life. Many

23:58.642 --> 24:01.747
times, let's change the topic for a minute. Many 
times I've read quite a bit on military history,

24:01.787 --> 24:15.687
especially journalists, other people who report 
on the military talk about what they call the

24:01.787 --> 24:15.687
military mentality. There's a military way to do 
things. Is there such a thing as a military

24:17.850 --> 24:19.873
mentality? Well, in the military you have,

24:21.195 --> 24:27.805
and in government, You have a tremendous amount of 
regulations to follow. And

24:35.133 --> 24:46.712
your military mentality really is controlled by 
military regulations. And

24:47.393 --> 24:56.627
you really don't have an opportunity to try new 
things. that is

24:58.413 --> 25:06.921
not in accordance with the rules and regulations. 
Okay, okay. So you get in, you're regimented in

25:09.623 --> 25:14.167
that way. In other

25:14.187 --> 25:26.698
words, what you would define as a military 
mentality is more regimentation, or more narrow

25:14.187 --> 25:26.698
maybe? It's more controlled. Once

25:30.149 --> 25:53.901
you

25:30.149 --> 25:53.901
get up into your more responsible jobs, not that 
you are limited to ways of doing things.

25:54.978 --> 26:23.955
when I went to Sioux Falls, South Dakota to 
establish a radio school up there, you really, you

25:54.978 --> 26:23.955
could freewheel all you wanted to as long as you 
stayed within the budget and you could come up with

25:54.978 --> 26:23.955
all kinds of ideas on how to build mock-ups for 
various radio circuits and you could go out and

25:54.978 --> 26:23.955
establish

26:25.201 --> 26:45.047
a collection center for all of the old radios in the 
state of South Dakota and North Dakota and

26:25.201 --> 26:45.047
Minnesota and Wisconsin and bring them in, tear 
them up and

26:25.201 --> 26:45.047
that type of thing was encouraged. Exactly what 
you taught in the schools using the teaching

26:46.509 --> 26:54.600
methods that you had developed was pretty well set 
down by a bunch of educators, of which I was one, I

26:55.087 --> 27:01.495
guess. That you have a big seminar and decide on 
almost a day-to-day basis what is to be taught. And

27:11.389 --> 27:12.550
I think it has to be. If you're going to teach 14,000 
students,

27:20.585 --> 27:29.014
In 16 weeks, a radio course that you come out of the 
profession, you have to do, it has to be done on a

27:20.585 --> 27:29.014
day-to-day basis. And you want those men to have 
similar training so they can communicate when

27:29.034 --> 27:33.458
they get out in the field. That's right.

27:37.262 --> 27:39.925
Let's talk about your graduation. Graduated from 
West Point right in the middle of the Great

27:40.526 --> 27:45.411
Depression. Wonderful. Wonderful that you had a 
job. Yeah, that's just exactly what I was going to

27:51.187 --> 27:53.550
ask. I bet you were quite happy to have a job at that 
time. Happy to have a job. We had a ten percent pay

27:58.857 --> 28:03.983
cut as a cycle lieutenant, but it didn't bother me. 
And I bought a 1930 Ford Roadster for two hundred

28:06.807 --> 28:14.757
dollars when I graduated. In 1932? 1930 Ford 
Roadster, and I bought it when I graduated in 1933.

28:22.065 --> 28:23.026
Oh, in 1933. So you bought a pretty new car for a 
young man to have during the Depression. Yeah, for

28:30.397 --> 28:35.605
$200, and I drove it home. No, I would say it was very 
nice to have a job. And talking to my classmates at

28:47.103 --> 28:55.439
at Texas A&M who graduated then in 32, why so many of 
them didn't have a job. Very few of them had jobs.

28:56.982 --> 29:02.373
They went out and sold apples on the corners and 
things of that sort.

29:03.716 --> 29:09.567
I think in talking to them is where you really have a 
story as to how they progressed from the apple cart

29:10.205 --> 29:16.915
up to a wholesale grocery company or something of 
this sort. There were a lot of successful people in

29:17.876 --> 29:20.820
that class of 32. Now, what was your first 
assignment as a second lieutenant? At Randolph,

29:26.508 --> 29:30.894
the flying school. Okay, can you tell me about 
that? Well, reported in and of course I really

29:38.858 --> 29:58.588
wasn't real concerned about learning to fly, 
whether or not I graduated or not graduated, to

29:38.858 --> 29:58.588
learn to fly or not fly, because I was going to 
transfer to the engineers anyway, so

29:38.858 --> 29:58.588
I guess I just relaxed. The people, some of the boys 
who had been looking forward since they were ten

29:59.309 --> 30:07.802
years old to be a pilot, they just washed out 
because they just froze up and what have you. But I

30:13.670 --> 30:17.557
didn't have any problem of learning to fly. Of 
course your mechanical engineering part of

30:17.597 --> 30:32.100
studying engines and aerodynamics and weather 
and all the ground schools, I was pretty well duck

30:17.597 --> 30:32.100
soup. That was no problem for you? No problem, no. 
and I went to Kelly and went through bombardment,

30:37.718 --> 30:53.098
which was, at that time we were flying Keystone 
bombers, a two-engine airplane, and that was my

30:37.718 --> 30:53.098
type. I wanted to pursue, I was a conservative type 
and I liked the bombardment. So I had no problem at

31:01.889 --> 31:05.093
all of learning to fly and of course Once you learn 
to fly I guess it's just like being a gambler or

31:05.765 --> 31:14.579
being an alcoholic or something else. It gets in 
your blood and I just stayed with it. Now this is not

31:20.308 --> 31:25.576
the exact time but fairly close to the Billy 
Mitchell problem. Do you remember that?
