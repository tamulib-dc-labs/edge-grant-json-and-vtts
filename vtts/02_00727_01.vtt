00:02.663 --> 00:29.447
Burns, would you tell us something about your 
early life, including the names of your parents,

00:02.663 --> 00:29.447
the dates of their birth and death, and the places 
where they were born and died, the date and place of

00:02.663 --> 00:29.447
your birth, the schools you attended before you 
went to Texas A&M, and any other recollections of

00:02.663 --> 00:29.447
your childhood that you have that you might want to 
record for us?

00:33.123 --> 00:42.414
Well, my father was Arthur Burns, and he was born 
January the 2nd, 1850. I

00:42.694 --> 00:49.462
don't know whether it was 52 or 53.

00:52.646 --> 00:54.849
He was an active cattleman all of his life. Went up 
the trail a number of years. Seven years, I think,

00:58.613 --> 01:00.936
drove the trail. He died in 1914. He was, where was 
he born? Born in DeWitt County of

01:06.222 --> 01:24.321
one of a family of 10 children who the father was 
Columbus Burns, the first white child born in what

01:06.222 --> 01:24.321
now DeWitt County. He was a son of Arthur Burns, my 
great grandfather. who came to Texas from Pike

01:29.840 --> 01:47.229
County, Missouri in 1826 and built a log cabin on 
the east side of Guadalupe River

01:29.840 --> 01:47.229
and obtained from the Mexican government a league 
of land. His son, Squire Burns, a laborer,

01:56.654 --> 02:05.442
He had previously been married, and several 
children came with him and his wife, I think his

01:56.654 --> 02:05.442
third wife, when they came to Texas. But Columbus 
Burns, my own grandfather, who was born in 1829 and

02:06.102 --> 02:18.974
died in 1899 in my home where I was read, was the 
first white child born in that area. He married a

02:19.374 --> 02:25.800
DeMoss, and of that union there were 10 children.

02:26.827 --> 02:28.790
five boys and five girls. My father was the second 
of the family. My mother was born Mary Evie

02:34.038 --> 02:49.283
Cardwell, was born in 1855 at

02:34.038 --> 02:49.283
the old Cardwell homestead four miles north of 
Cuero. Her father was Crockett Cardwell, who was

02:54.991 --> 03:12.612
born in 1812 during the Battle of New Orleans and 
came to Texas in the early 1830s, 1833 I believe,

02:54.991 --> 03:12.612
and came to Gonzales.

03:15.675 --> 03:24.205
My mother's mother, my own grandmother, Ann Eliza 
White, married Crockett Cardwell in 1846.

03:26.193 --> 03:30.778
No.

03:30.798 --> 03:31.780
They married 1840. They bought the old Friar 
original

03:32.140 --> 03:46.837
homestead property north of Cuero in 1846. That's 
where my mother was born. She had a brother

03:49.601 --> 03:55.828
that lived died in early childhood as a boy eight 
years old.

04:03.393 --> 04:20.601
Anna Eliza White was a mother and father left 
Elizabeth down in North Carolina in 1829 to come to

04:03.393 --> 04:20.601
Texas, and he died en route in Alabama. And my 
grandmother, Anna Eliza White, was born in 1824.

04:28.026 --> 04:29.568
She had four brothers.

04:32.472 --> 04:35.155
Let's see, yeah, I believe four, maybe five. They 
all came to Texas, and her mother remarried a

04:35.936 --> 04:46.808
fellow named Tomlinson and came on to old 
Washington on the Brazos with Austin's colonists

04:35.936 --> 04:46.808
and Berta Gonzalez. And she was in Gonzales when 
Sandy Anna ran them out. And one of her

04:53.929 --> 04:58.015
stepbrothers, a Tumbleson, was in the Battle of 
the Alamo. That bunch that went from Gonzales to

04:58.456 --> 05:06.528
San Antonio was killed in the Battle of the Alamo.

05:06.548 --> 05:17.925
I've heard her say many times that when Sandy Anna 
ran them out of Gonzales,

05:06.548 --> 05:17.925
she rode a big old gray car-chair horse from 
Gonzales to the Battle of San Jacinto. It was

05:20.427 --> 05:24.672
within 12 miles of the Battle of San Jacinto when it 
was fought. They didn't route there. They could

05:27.374 --> 05:38.285
see Houston's army in front of them, the dust from 
across that Eagle Lake prairie, and Santa Ana's

05:27.374 --> 05:38.285
army behind them. So it was pretty squally. She was 
a great historian, an Irish gal, and had a lot of

05:41.348 --> 05:47.114
energy and a lot of gold. She lived to be 90 years old 
and died my mother's own at Cuero.

05:57.181 --> 06:02.954
They were all of the early, real early settlers in 
South Texas. It was a big family connection over

06:02.974 --> 06:05.580
the Burns. Dr. John W. Burns made quite a 
reputation. He and his two sons, his doctors

06:10.099 --> 06:12.221
there. Louis Burns was a farmer, stock farmer 
north of Quero there for many, many years. And old

06:19.409 --> 06:33.846
Judge Jim Burns was judge, county attorney over 
at, lawyer over at Goliad and operated a private

06:19.409 --> 06:33.846
bank there for many, many years.

06:35.311 --> 06:39.457
It was a big family connection, but most of them are 
gone. Very few of them

06:39.497 --> 06:45.505
survived. I was born in July 1895, after

06:45.525 --> 07:00.306
the family had moved from the old Cardwell 
homestead four miles north of Quirrell. My father

07:00.927 --> 07:08.116
had built my mother a new home there in late 1894, 
early 95, and that's where I was born. I was the only

07:08.176 --> 07:12.421
child of a family of five that was born in Cuero. The 
rest of them were born at the old Cardwell

07:12.461 --> 07:18.368
homestead north of Cuero, two brothers and two 
sisters. John C. Burns, who was later head

07:18.688 --> 07:28.420
of animal husbandry department at A&M College,

07:30.948 --> 07:43.062
an 0-4 man, and A.C. Burns, born in 1886, an 0-7 man, 
and two sisters, Mrs. J.W. Hawke of Cuero, and Mrs.

07:43.082 --> 07:48.609
Evie Locker. Mrs. Locker's deceased, and John C. 
Burns' deceased. The other sister, Mrs. Hawke,

07:53.355 --> 07:59.622
still lives in Cuero, in the rest home there. A.C. 
Burns, a veterinarian, a graduate of A&M in 07,

08:00.395 --> 08:15.251
graduate in veterinary medicine at Ohio State in 
1910, and has practiced in the Cleveland area

08:00.395 --> 08:15.251
until retirement a few years ago. I went to public 
school at Cuero and probably reached the seventh,

08:17.454 --> 08:24.561
eighth grade, not over the eighth grade, I don't 
believe. They picked me up, sent me to Allen

08:24.822 --> 08:29.727
Academy about 1910, 11.

08:33.858 --> 08:38.704
Old man John Rivers Allen was operating at an 
academy that had a real good school.

08:43.811 --> 08:52.542
I can't remember whether I went there in ten or 
eleven.

08:52.562 --> 08:58.129
A number of the boys that I went to school there, 
some few went to A&M later. A bunch of those boys

08:58.930 --> 09:01.553
went to Swanee later. A whole bunch of Waco boys I 
know went to Suwannee. I entered A&M College in the

09:05.684 --> 09:15.918
fall of 1912 and finished the spring of 1916 in 
animal husbandry. What factors were involved in

09:16.459 --> 09:20.105
your choice of A&M? You had a brother who had been 
there. Two of them had been there before. I don't

09:25.893 --> 09:28.917
know if there was any choice about it. It just went. 
Just automatic. Just automatic. That's right. No

09:35.297 --> 09:37.521
other school was considered. If I ever had any 
other thought, I don't remember it.

09:44.512 --> 09:50.482
Did you go through any particular procedures to 
enter school there? I mean, did you apply for

09:51.404 --> 09:52.906
admission? Did you have to take a test or anything 
like that?

10:00.173 --> 10:16.400
Yeah, I think I went out there and put in an 
application to accept him, but I think when I got

10:00.173 --> 10:16.400
out there, they gave me some examinations, one of 
which I didn't pass, and they made me take some work

10:00.173 --> 10:16.400
over, which I flunked then promptly. You had 
completed all of the instruction at Allen

10:16.540 --> 10:21.369
Academy, though, by the time you applied. No, just 
enough to get into A&M. I didn't graduate at Allen.

10:27.967 --> 10:31.191
Was there a minimum age entrance to A&M at that 
point? Did you have to be a certain number of years

10:32.173 --> 10:35.597
old before you could enter A&M? I don't know. I 
finished before I was 21 years old. I finished June

10:40.564 --> 10:45.070
and I was 21 July following graduation. So you must 
have been, what, about 16 when you entered.

10:49.977 --> 10:52.200
Probably you couldn't have gotten in any younger 
than that. No, I was about right. Well, since

10:55.324 --> 10:57.467
you... Allen was then, of course, a military 
school as it is now. No, it wasn't. It was not a

11:02.676 --> 11:03.939
military school then? No, no, no. I see. So then you 
had not had any... I had had no military training at

11:09.651 --> 11:13.178
all when I went to A&M. You were probably aware of 
some of the military aspects. Oh, I'd been out

11:15.534 --> 11:16.536
there. I had a brother. This older brother was head 
of animal husbandry department living on the

11:17.778 --> 11:21.645
campus. So I knew everybody out there. You knew all 
the faculty members. Oh, I was hazed two years

11:25.453 --> 11:27.516
instead of one. You bet. I knew all of them. You bet. 
So you say you were hazed two years instead of one.

11:34.507 --> 11:35.028
Oh, yes. The year before you got there and the first 
year you were there. The year before, because I had

11:37.592 --> 11:40.898
this brother there and everybody knew him. John 
Burns' brother. Boy, we were making hard on him.

11:45.826 --> 11:49.893
Well, I had the best time of anybody. So when I went 
out there, I didn't know any strangers, so I knew

11:50.054 --> 11:55.062
everybody. A number of people have commented to me 
that the only people who hazed you were the ones who

11:55.548 --> 12:00.593
really liked you. That's exactly right. That boy 
that didn't want to be hazed was not hazed. That's

12:05.378 --> 12:09.181
all baloney about him being cruel and everything. 
I've seen some boys ostracized down there because

12:09.201 --> 12:12.865
he just couldn't take it. But I've never had more 
fun than I had during my fishing sophomore year

12:13.866 --> 12:25.217
because I took it and then I dished it out when I was a 
sophomore. Well, I imagine the boy who didn't want

12:26.783 --> 12:31.913
to be hazed wasn't hazed, and he wasn't liked very 
well. He wasn't very popular, that's

12:31.933 --> 12:38.045
right. You were, of course, completely familiar 
with it, and I guess there were really no surprises

12:38.305 --> 12:43.074
to you when you got there. Oh, yeah, no, there 
wasn't any surprises. You knew what to expect and

12:44.998 --> 12:48.184
everything like that. You, I believe, entered L 
Company as a fish. Did you have some choice in that

12:54.218 --> 12:56.521
matter? Well, they just put you in a company where 
they wanted you. And as a member of L Company, where

13:01.227 --> 13:05.593
did you live? Austin Hall, the oldest on the 
campus, that's right. We carried wood and water, a

13:10.660 --> 13:18.070
wood stove and a bucket and a wash basin there. a 
table and two beds and about two chairs, and that

13:18.893 --> 13:22.196
was it. You had, what, two people in the room? Yeah, 
me and another boy, and I don't even remember who

13:24.319 --> 13:28.903
the other boy was right at the moment. I believe a 
boy named Hans Rice, R-E-U-S-S, from Cuero. And

13:35.590 --> 13:36.972
they moved us. If he and I started rooming there, 
they moved us later to the top story of Milner Hall

13:36.992 --> 13:42.598
after the strike. So you had a strike down there, 
too. This was in? 1970. Thirteen. Thirteen, yeah.

13:50.761 --> 13:52.303
That's when a bunch of boys left school. That's 
right. That's exactly right. Well, after that,

13:54.125 --> 13:55.947
they closed up. They moved a whole bunch of us from 
Austin Hall. The L Company was in Austin Hall and

14:00.973 --> 14:07.942
the fourth floor of Milner. So Austin was not big 
enough for the whole company? I reckon. But

14:12.067 --> 14:13.369
anyhow, they moved us. and put us upstairs on the 
fourth floor, I reckon, of Milner Hall. Well,

14:19.279 --> 14:24.628
Milner probably had central heat, I believe, at 
that point, so you didn't have to carry wood

14:19.279 --> 14:24.628
anymore. That's right. We carried many a trunk up 
those steps. I imagine so. In Milner, then, I

14:31.743 --> 14:35.669
gather they had a bathroom on every floor. Oh, 
yeah. They had showers on every floor, yeah.

14:39.876 --> 14:49.071
Whereas when living in Austin Hall, we had to go to 
that old bath, the old, what do we call it, down

14:39.876 --> 14:49.071
there, where they had showers. You'd take your 
clothes and soap and towels and go down there and

14:49.091 --> 14:54.640
take a bath. And then go back to the Austin Hall. 
That's right. So when you were moved out, then

14:57.798 --> 14:59.740
what'd they do? Just kind of close Austin Hall? I 
think they closed Austin Hall and later made a

15:01.102 --> 15:05.087
storage place over there. Probably some other 
personnel lived there for a while. It was an old

15:13.497 --> 15:15.659
one, sure enough. I imagine during the war or after 
when they had an increase in enrollment, they

15:16.100 --> 15:21.025
probably opened it up again. Probably did. I 
wasn't there at that time, of course.

15:26.958 --> 15:30.363
You indicated that there was a strike in 1913. What 
do you recall that was the cause of that? Oh, I don't

15:35.030 --> 15:36.292
know. One of the factors was hazing. They had let 
some boys go, and they wanted to reinstate them,

15:40.658 --> 15:50.212
and they weren't pleased with Milner, who was 
president. There was some other factors that I

15:50.232 --> 15:55.800
don't remember now. We entered into it and of 
course there's always a bunch that wanted to blow

15:56.033 --> 16:01.304
up. And they lost a lot of good students. They lost a 
lot of good men that left during that strike and

16:05.933 --> 16:09.561
never did come back. And of course some of them did 
come back. Now this was, the school had dismissed

16:12.790 --> 16:16.855
some people who were guilty of hazing. Oh yeah, 
that's right. And the other boys in... They took

16:20.138 --> 16:21.880
exception to it. They wanted to reinstate it. 
That's right. And I think it was over in D Company.

16:26.225 --> 16:27.787
I'm not sure where it was. Seemed to me like it was in 
Foster Hall. D Company was in Foster Hall. And I

16:32.672 --> 16:36.336
don't remember the particulars of it. And they had 
several mass meetings and... haranguing about

16:41.005 --> 16:45.092
quitting and this, that, and the other. Well, how 
did the strike come in? Did the students refuse to

16:47.956 --> 16:50.420
go to school anymore? Well, they just decided not 
to go to school. Went home. The others stayed there

16:55.949 --> 16:59.655
and they opened classes and went back to school. 
About how long did this whole business go on, do you

17:00.800 --> 17:04.445
remember? Probably a week. I don't remember. 
That's been a long time ago. Yeah, I'm sure. I know

17:10.172 --> 17:10.753
it has. It's been a lot of things since that time.

17:20.046 --> 17:27.195
I imagine there was probably a good bit of 
difference in life in the dormitory from when you

17:20.046 --> 17:27.195
moved from Austin to Milner, wasn't it? Not a great 
deal. You still had a guard every night. You had a

17:33.150 --> 17:34.992
guard over at Austin Hall. You had a guard at the 
middle of the same. It wasn't much different. A

17:40.280 --> 17:41.421
little more convenient. We didn't have to carry 
wood and water. You didn't have to carry wood and

17:42.643 --> 17:45.287
water, so that was a little bit easier. You still 
had a few things to do for the upperclassmen. Oh,

17:48.251 --> 17:51.335
the upperclassmen, it was just like being in the 
Army. There was no monkey business about that.

17:53.638 --> 17:55.541
Now, they ran the school. They ran the... company 
and they were respected and what they said went.

18:01.847 --> 18:03.809
There wasn't any monkey business about it. Junior

18:05.031 --> 18:17.509
and senior classes, of course, upperclassmen,

18:05.031 --> 18:17.509
they were absolutely in charge. Their word was the 
law. That was it, that's right. In addition to

18:23.517 --> 18:25.380
having this this control over the freshmen, did 
the upperclassmen have any other privileges that

18:25.748 --> 18:30.913
they could exercise? Oh, yeah, they could go to 
town, they could stay out, they'd get off, get

18:31.254 --> 18:36.419
furloughed. The freshmen couldn't get 
furloughed. And I think sophomores maybe get off

18:39.122 --> 18:44.427
twice a month, and maybe a junior. I forgot the 
details. By furlough, does this mean they could go

18:47.170 --> 18:49.933
home? They could go to Brown, maybe to Calvert, 
maybe to... get off Saturday afternoon, see.

18:58.243 --> 18:59.024
About that. They didn't let you off too much. So 
they couldn't go to Houston for the weekend or

19:01.727 --> 19:04.269
something like that. Yeah, that's right. You 
might get a furlough, go home if you live close. But

19:07.733 --> 19:13.919
you didn't travel around like this now because 
there wasn't a way to travel. You either went on the

19:14.960 --> 19:19.665
train or walked. That's right. There were very few 
automobiles then. And the cadets weren't allowed

19:23.630 --> 19:27.956
to have one, I understand. No, no, they didn't have 
any. Nobody on the campus had an automobile that

19:29.117 --> 19:32.241
had cadets in it. There was a few cars and bronze, a 
few on the campus, of course, but that's still in

19:32.762 --> 19:38.930
horse and buggy days.

19:41.994 --> 19:50.384
Okay, so you lived first in Austin Hall, then you 
moved to Milner during your first year there. Did

19:50.404 --> 19:52.167
you live in any other dorms? Oh, yeah.

19:55.422 --> 20:03.073
I'm not sure whether this boy that I lived in 
Austin,

19:55.422 --> 20:03.073
he may have left on the strike. Anyhow, he didn't 
come back for his second year. I roomed with a young

20:05.957 --> 20:12.026
man from Gonzales named Milton Barringer three 
years.

20:15.450 --> 20:19.276
We roomed in Ross Hall until we graduated.

20:21.739 --> 20:23.662
Was that when you were in A Company? A Company, 
that's right. And he was later president of a

20:25.797 --> 20:34.108
British American oil company in Toronto, Canada. 
A very fine young man, had a good mind, and made an

20:34.128 --> 20:39.776
outstanding record. And in Ross Hall, you had the 
stoves, did you, and washstands and so forth like

20:39.796 --> 20:50.050
that, being in older Durham? Or do you remember? I 
think they'd put in steam heat at Ross Hall, maybe.

20:55.954 --> 20:57.196
By that time? Yeah. And the old bugle deal, the 
bugle was right down under the window down there.

21:07.211 --> 21:08.493
So we didn't miss any calls. Couldn't sleep 
through it. And this boy in our room with us, I never

21:10.096 --> 21:15.084
was very military, but he was. He was a corporal and 
a sergeant, 1st Sergeant of the 8th Company. I

21:19.763 --> 21:22.791
believe, and later Captain A Company. Well, I 
believe you made it up to 2nd Lieutenant A Company,

21:22.811 --> 21:25.438
didn't you? Oh, yeah, but they did that. It was 
forced on them. I was above privates, and they

21:27.664 --> 21:34.802
couldn't make the above privates to go to drills, 
see. So they made us all second lieutenants so we'd

21:35.153 --> 21:39.339
have to attend. By they, who do you mean by they? The 
bull, the commandant, the military department,

21:41.241 --> 21:45.728
see. There was a bunch of us buck privates, see. As 
seniors? As seniors, yeah. And they just made us

21:50.975 --> 21:55.241
all second lieutenants so we had to attend 
formation. That's how simple that was. I see. So

21:58.084 --> 22:03.011
you had a kind of an over... See, a buck private, he 
could strangle down to mess all. He didn't have to

22:03.051 --> 22:04.333
attend any. any formations. That would be a senior 
buck probably. Yeah, he could strike. I was a

22:08.649 --> 22:26.490
sergeant in G Company but roomed in A Company 
because I worked at this fellow and I'd run the year

22:08.649 --> 22:26.490
before in Milner and then we moved over to Ross and I 
waited till

22:08.649 --> 22:26.490
Mitchell, G Company's over in Mitchell. Well I 
waited till they filled up then I said, well I can't

22:26.510 --> 22:31.536
move over there, there's no place to move, see. So I 
went, but I attended formation in G Company during

22:32.933 --> 22:42.049
my junior year and was a line sergeant in G Company. 
But I was a buck private the next year, but I was

22:42.069 --> 22:47.638
rooming in A Company. You got a demotion the next 
year. That's all right. Yeah, it was good. As I

22:51.465 --> 22:54.370
said, I never was military. I was. So when they made 
a whole bunch of your second lieutenants, you must

22:55.327 --> 22:59.834
have had a surplus of second lieutenants. Oh, we 
had them. You bet they had several of them in every

23:00.535 --> 23:03.880
company then, you know. It's all right. If I do 
this, I'll inject this thought into it, that it's

23:05.803 --> 23:16.999
the finest thing that any young man can have is two 
years of military. I think every young man should

23:17.660 --> 23:23.309
have two years of military service. It's... Some 
things that you learned

23:25.111 --> 23:42.676
that you'll never learn anywhere else, 
particularly how to take and give orders, because

23:25.111 --> 23:42.676
very few people ever live to the point they don't 
have to take orders somewhere in their long life.

23:43.497 --> 23:45.419
So it's the best training in the world. I think 
every young man ought to have two years of military

23:45.479 --> 23:49.585
training. Whether it's in school or otherwise. It 
don't make any difference. I don't care whether

23:51.875 --> 23:56.920
he's in school, whether he takes it in college, or 
whether he takes it in the Army. Preferably, I'd

23:57.881 --> 24:02.485
see them taking the Marine Corps because they've 
got discipline. They can all tell you about the

24:02.785 --> 24:10.573
freedom of this, that, and the other, but I want to 
tell you this world today lacks discipline. We

24:11.013 --> 24:11.574
need it. We need it badly. We need supervision. I 
agree with you. If ever I want to have a good

24:16.358 --> 24:20.582
argument with my wife, I tell her that. She 
disagrees with me. I see by your yearbook that you

24:24.464 --> 24:29.471
were also in the Bugle Corps. I was. They all got in a 
big water fight at mail company one night and they

24:30.373 --> 24:41.608
caught us all and made us go to the Commodore's 
office.

24:44.069 --> 24:50.418
write an explanation, and this, that, and the 
other, and called us all up, and commented on old

24:44.069 --> 24:50.418
Levi G. Brown. He was tough, too. He was 
commenting, but he was all right. And so he says,

24:55.906 --> 25:01.894
Mr. Burns says, you're not getting along very good 
in the Air Company. But I wasn't because I didn't

25:03.997 --> 25:07.883
particularly like the captain, and They did have a 
first lieutenant was a nice fellow and a second

25:07.964 --> 25:16.472
lieutenant was a nice fellow, but I didn't like the 
captain at all.

25:19.195 --> 25:26.662
We didn't see eye to eye, but anyhow we all got in a 
big water fight up on the 34th floor of Milner Hall.

25:27.803 --> 25:30.826
Buckets of water just sluiced and they caught us. 
So they sent us all to the Commandant's office for

25:32.087 --> 25:35.811
an explanation. Old Levi Brown told me, he says, 
Mr. Barnes, you're not getting along very good in

25:36.449 --> 25:41.395
the L Company. He says, we're going to reorganize 
the bugle corps. He says, we want to put you in the

25:45.741 --> 25:47.844
bugle corps. I said, why would I have to blow a 
bugle? And I never did learn either.

25:54.432 --> 25:55.534
But you stayed in the bugle corps? I stayed in the 
bugle corps. For how long? short till the balance

25:58.387 --> 26:23.770
of that year and that was along in the spring so i 
wasn't in beautiful johnny garrity and ron hansen

25:58.387 --> 26:23.770
and all several of us in there and put a good bunch of 
boys we had a good time but you never never learned

25:58.387 --> 26:23.770
how to blow i never did i could did even noise that's 
about all uh even though you didn't didn't really

25:58.387 --> 26:23.770
learn how did they still have you take a turn at the 
Added in the morning or in the afternoon? I don't

26:26.946 --> 26:37.381
think they ever trusted me that

26:26.946 --> 26:37.381
far.

26:40.745 --> 26:42.448
What was the food like in the mess hall? Did you have 
the new mess hall? No, you didn't have the new one

26:44.991 --> 26:47.014
when you started, did you? No, I reckon we was down 
to old mess hall when we started there in the fall of

26:47.675 --> 26:53.183
12. I've eaten down the old one. Yeah, I believe we 
had the old mess hall, and later on the next year I

26:55.407 --> 27:00.272
believe we had Spiezel Hall. The old one burned, I 
guess, while you were fishing. Yeah, that's

27:02.774 --> 27:03.335
right. The old one burned. That's right. The main 
building burned. The main building burned while I

27:06.218 --> 27:08.780
was tailing the academy. The old main building. 
Yeah, it burned the year before you started, and

27:09.781 --> 27:13.585
the mess hall burned in 12. Yeah, that's right. And 
you had a temporary one for a while. That's right,

27:16.688 --> 27:18.630
yeah. Oh, we got by on it all right. I think Thursday 
nights they had T-bone steaks and everybody loved

27:23.867 --> 27:28.332
those, of course. We got by. We had plenty to eat. It 
wasn't too bad. Pretty monotonous at times? Oh,

27:34.559 --> 27:35.260
yeah. It gets old. It's like anything else, you 
know.

27:41.828 --> 27:42.769
It's been a lot worse. What did you do for 
entertainment and recreation if you did anything

27:43.730 --> 27:49.377
other than have a water fight done in it? Oh, we shot 
dice and played cards. We had a card game going in L

27:53.253 --> 27:59.424
Company for, oh, I don't know. Poker game? Oh, 
pitch principally. Very little poker. Had a few

28:06.156 --> 28:07.279
dice games. I learned early in my career that I was 
not a dice shooter. I didn't shoot dice much, but we

28:12.610 --> 28:20.144
did have a pitch game going most of the time. I 
devoted a lot of time to that.

28:27.056 --> 28:30.562
There wasn't much recreation, really. You kind of 
had to make your own.

28:36.168 --> 28:43.121
And then you'd get off maybe once a month, maybe 
you'd go to Braun and see a picture show, and that

28:36.168 --> 28:43.121
was about it. And that old trolley, you know, that 
was an old gasoline trolley run from Braun to

28:43.141 --> 28:47.590
college. Yeah. I believe later they made it 
electric. Oh yeah, that's right, but that was an

28:51.137 --> 28:53.982
old gasoline trolley early.

28:56.928 --> 28:57.028
Yeah. hadn't been going for more than a year or two 
when you started there. And of course there was

28:59.858 --> 29:03.442
football in the fall and basketball. They just 
started doing basketball to any degree and

29:03.502 --> 29:09.028
baseball in the spring. You could go out there and 
watch them practice and that stuff. Of course you

29:11.811 --> 29:14.434
drilled it three days a week. You drilled Monday, 
Wednesday, and Friday, see. For how long? Two

29:18.619 --> 29:19.120
hours. Two hours? You bet, yeah. I think two hours. 
Spent a good bit of time in class and in lab, too.

29:27.110 --> 29:28.011
That's right. You had lab classes in the 
afternoon. You got up 6 o'clock in the morning in

29:30.854 --> 29:34.939
formation. You had room inspection.

29:40.165 --> 29:43.729
You had things pretty clean, pretty well done up. 
Then Sunday morning, every Sunday morning, you

29:43.749 --> 29:47.714
had Sunday morning inspection. Did you have your 
inspection before or after you went to chapel?

29:52.679 --> 29:54.782
Before you went to chapel, yeah. You'd go to chapel 
till 11 o'clock, I believe. Some old boys went to

29:56.985 --> 29:59.769
Sunday school classes. You had Sunday school 
before chapel then? Yeah, we had Sunday morning

30:02.513 --> 30:06.097
inspection usually before chapel. So what, you'd 
line up on Military Walk and have inspection? No,

30:09.262 --> 30:11.024
room inspection. Room inspection, so you had to be 
in the room. Yeah, you bet. It had to be clean, too.

30:17.113 --> 30:20.357
Your guns had to be clean, and everything had to be 
in order. And that was part of the regular army that

30:20.624 --> 30:24.434
came by? Oh, yeah, absolutely. But then you also 
had a daily inspection, didn't you? Well, of

30:28.424 --> 30:31.272
course, that daily inspection. They'd look in on 
those rooms every morning to see if your beds were

30:31.312 --> 30:35.663
made up.
