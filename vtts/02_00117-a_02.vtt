WEBVTT

00:05.954 --> 00:22.950
Thank you.

00:33.916 --> 00:36.239
So when did you officially become a business 
major? Sophomore year? During the sophomore

00:38.501 --> 00:41.544
year, I made a decision. I don't recall if it was 
during the sophomore year before it was changed or

00:41.564 --> 00:45.088
before it was changed. But I can remember June 
being very business specific. And your major,

00:47.471 --> 00:50.694
specific major, was management? Yes. All right. 
Who over in there, who were some advisors,

00:52.156 --> 00:56.921
counselors, teachers?

00:59.824 --> 01:01.146
I had a... See? Yes. That's my favorite. Cool.

01:25.814 --> 01:31.682
Cool.

01:44.048 --> 02:02.704
During your undergraduate days, what did you and 
your buddies think were the expected rules of

01:44.048 --> 02:02.704
classroom behavior and attendance

01:44.048 --> 02:02.704
and

01:44.048 --> 02:02.704
so forth? I think you've got to think about your own 
territory in the future. I learned early on that if

02:04.628 --> 02:05.550
I was going to have

02:15.892 --> 02:39.376
I can

02:15.892 --> 02:39.376
say

02:15.892 --> 02:39.376
that depending on the future, and I made every 
effort to attend every class, but I did not cut a lot

02:15.892 --> 02:39.376
of time. And I did have a few friends that did, and 
most of those didn't make it out, didn't make it

02:39.396 --> 02:41.398
through. Again, I think at the end of that four 
years, I can remember taking specific courses, I

02:41.418 --> 02:45.662
can remember taking courses further into my 
business direction that they were not easy, and

02:41.418 --> 02:45.662
they They

02:46.098 --> 03:06.207
didn't necessarily try to make it easy. They were 
just trying to see if you had the skill to do that.

03:07.468 --> 03:10.393
And I did, and I got, ultimately got out of that with 
about three points, just two eights to three

03:07.468 --> 03:10.393
points, something like that, high two to three. 
And I was proud of that because I was number 13 and I

03:10.413 --> 03:12.055
was able to get out of that. During the summers, did 
you have any particular summer jobs that related

03:12.693 --> 03:20.103
to your later career? I worked two summers

03:20.123 --> 03:30.757
at the San Antonio International Airport 
delivering air freight. And I predominantly did

03:30.777 --> 03:31.478
baggage. And it's kind of neat because that's just 
when they started hijacking, started, I guess,

03:31.798 --> 03:37.205
late 60s, early 70s. And they were already making 
security and getting out. And I was able to drive.

04:05.731 --> 04:09.836
Did that help to draw you toward... I would say it 
kept my attitude in mind. Let's see. Was the MSC

04:15.902 --> 04:18.345
important to you? Why? Describe your role.

04:29.797 --> 04:33.902
I lived to go from there, but I didn't do that. If I 
didn't have a girlfriend...

04:37.827 --> 05:05.083
Was

04:37.827 --> 05:05.083
the expansion finished during your days? Were

05:05.620 --> 05:14.558
you a part of any, member of any of the MSC 
activities? Yeah, I was one year, I didn't see you,

05:15.219 --> 05:24.658
but they had a, they had like a, for lack of a better 
term, like a

05:49.613 --> 06:19.114
During

05:49.613 --> 06:19.114
your days at A&M, did it matter where a student came 
from geographically? Racially or economically?

06:46.060 --> 06:52.780
among your acquaintances, was there a variety 
of...

07:21.565 --> 07:26.260
Were you, did you participate in any religious 
activities?

07:56.513 --> 08:16.660
And

07:56.513 --> 08:16.660
that was a year also when you don't have a question. 
And I found it a real good time to be in the

08:16.680 --> 08:17.821
legislature. And I used the office capital, 
although it was a file. And the dealer was always

08:18.943 --> 08:20.345
nice to see me, but I couldn't say anything. That's 
the third time it's required. And it's even

08:21.106 --> 08:22.147
pretty, so I wasn't here for a living. But it just, 
you know, you see everything now that you think of.

08:48.539 --> 09:03.762
When

08:48.539 --> 09:03.762
you went to All Faith Chapel, what did you

08:48.539 --> 09:03.762
do?

09:11.755 --> 09:13.197
So you would go in and sit? You didn't read.

09:22.891 --> 09:25.638
Did you grow up in a church-related family? I did. 
We were never seen in the morning, but we would go

09:27.062 --> 09:28.165
out.

09:46.015 --> 09:53.786
Let's go back to

09:46.015 --> 09:53.786
some specific A&M things. Describe court

09:53.806 --> 10:11.993
trips. Most of the court trips I remember when we 
stayed Most

10:15.513 --> 10:37.744
times, there's a group somewhere, and we would 
have dates that we would, you know, not be one of the

10:15.513 --> 10:37.744
student houses, but maybe one of the student 
cities. And we have, you know, about 15 of us stay in

10:37.764 --> 10:38.805
there. And a lot of us have had dates. You know, the 
dates must stay in the middle part of the house. I

10:40.728 --> 10:41.509
mean, we tell them to take it to you. There were so 
much more things to come. I'm sure there was some

10:42.330 --> 10:43.872
legal matters, you know, but it just wasn't that 
way. And we just couldn't do that. Now, where did

10:44.892 --> 10:48.597
you all get those groups of dates? A

10:48.617 --> 11:08.302
lot

10:48.617 --> 11:08.302
of

10:48.617 --> 11:08.302
it was one of them. Who arranged them? You trust 
anybody. Somebody was going to trust you. It

11:09.744 --> 11:10.265
really wasn't warranty. It was probably 80% of the 
time. They weren't necessarily the right people,

11:10.946 --> 11:12.087
but they were. You had to find them. You knew you had 
to find them. That's what it was. Did you or anyone

11:14.069 --> 11:25.501
else you know ever have an awkward experience when 
it came time after an Aggie touchdown to kiss the

11:14.069 --> 11:25.501
date? Yeah, probably most of his blind dates it 
wasn't awkward. He would get

11:30.606 --> 11:39.115
kind of to a quick peck or he would go to the park when 
he was in the three-yard line and he'd find

11:30.606 --> 11:39.115
someone.

11:47.701 --> 12:12.190
Mm-hmm.

12:19.747 --> 12:26.134
Did y'all ever have a moose pot or a beast bucket?

12:33.283 --> 12:37.388
You put a little money in the pot and whoever had the 
worst date got the money? Y'all didn't do that? Did

12:41.913 --> 12:47.560
you have a favorite place as you look back on it now 
for court trips? Did you enjoy one place more than

12:49.733 --> 13:14.914
others

13:15.569 --> 13:18.353
Do you remember it as you think back on court trips? 
Do you have a positive feel about them? Were you all

13:20.156 --> 13:44.511
treated pleasantly?

13:44.531 --> 13:45.272
I don't remember any of it. And

13:45.809 --> 14:04.911
when you hitchhiked, say, to Dallas.

14:04.931 --> 14:06.913
San Antonio. Where did you start at A&M? Where did 
you catch the ride

14:08.776 --> 14:13.141
first? Well, I hitchhiked to Washington, so I have 
to remember that. I

14:14.783 --> 14:35.974
had another buddy that went about a third of the 
time trying to do it. And so we would show him up. But

14:36.575 --> 14:37.617
I can remember one time when he and I showed up. We 
got back, had those in front of us. And it must have

14:38.418 --> 14:39.379
been 10 to 11 o'clock at night. We just got back. We 
just got back. We just got back. And we took another

14:40.481 --> 14:41.663
like three people to get us home early. But usually 
we got back at the first five to six.

14:45.901 --> 14:49.667
Did you ever have any bad experiences? I haven't 
yet encountered one.

14:59.982 --> 15:15.165
And

14:59.982 --> 15:15.165
am I correct in guessing that quite often you ended 
up riding with another aggie that you might not

14:59.982 --> 15:15.165
have otherwise known before? Oh,

15:16.225 --> 15:27.337
no, but I was meaning that it might be by accident 
two Aggies might get picked up by the same person.

15:27.597 --> 15:31.501
Oh, yeah, that happens. If you're an A&M person and 
you're going down the road and you see a guy in

15:31.521 --> 15:40.390
uniform, a guy with an A&M cap or a sister's 
sweater, there would be a question. Would you be

15:40.410 --> 15:41.271
picking up people on the road? All right, the 
student organizations, which ones had the

15:42.500 --> 15:47.854
highest prestige? Band, singing cadets?

16:10.225 --> 16:30.951
Fish

16:10.225 --> 16:30.951
drill

16:10.225 --> 16:30.951
team.

16:42.794 --> 16:57.478
What about Yoli?

17:15.515 --> 17:21.245
Let's see, that car that you brought that freshman 
year, you didn't keep it long? So

17:21.606 --> 17:31.583
you didn't have a car then for a good while?

17:43.510 --> 17:48.448
All right, now, coeds began to increase in number 
while you were there. What did you and your buddies

17:49.732 --> 17:53.385
think about that?

18:30.777 --> 18:45.040
And

18:30.777 --> 18:45.040
you and your buddies, I'm assuming, did not think 
of those coeds as high-priority choices for

18:30.777 --> 18:45.040
dates.

18:47.925 --> 18:52.312
Was that generally true among the Corps members 
you knew? Were there any women in the Corps yet at

18:54.295 --> 18:56.599
that point?

19:00.612 --> 19:24.733
They

19:00.612 --> 19:24.733
just started, like, in our junior year, it seems 
like, the Navy and the Marines. I know that the Navy

19:24.753 --> 19:25.393
was set up. And I don't remember the numbers, but at 
the end of the quad, they were the first one we left.

19:27.315 --> 19:27.916
And that was kind of in there. That was the 
non-airport, non-army guys. So, like, you just

19:28.756 --> 19:29.657
went elsewhere to be free. When you came, Earl 
Rutter was president. Did you and your buddies

19:37.131 --> 19:42.481
have any image of him, any feeling? What did you all 
think about Earl Rutter? You know, I didn't think

19:43.944 --> 19:47.130
anything of him. He was so different from my 
everyday life. And I see today it seems like

20:00.130 --> 20:25.855
He's

20:00.130 --> 20:25.855
followed and succeeded by Jack Williams, who was 
president when you graduated. Did you and your

20:25.915 --> 20:27.657
buddies have any Yes.

20:54.492 --> 20:54.572
Yes. The student leaders who worked with Dr. 
Williams nicknamed him quickly Smiling Jack

20:55.008 --> 21:02.760
because he had a perpetual smile. Did you have much 
interaction in the community? Did you go to many

21:07.387 --> 21:11.213
places in Bryan College Station? Where did you and 
your buddies go to have a good time on a Saturday

21:12.294 --> 21:20.627
night if you stayed there?

21:44.165 --> 21:58.798
If

21:44.165 --> 21:58.798
somebody wanted to go get beer, where was that?

22:16.126 --> 22:23.942
In the dorm?

22:46.552 --> 22:58.228
No,

22:46.552 --> 22:58.228
it's not

22:46.552 --> 22:58.228
bothering me. I didn't want to bother you.

23:02.574 --> 23:04.416
Was Whiskey Bridge still a reality? You

23:04.596 --> 23:10.264
can buy alcohol in Brazos County. And that little 
building has just been torn down within the last

23:12.151 --> 23:15.936
year and a half. And I've used that phrase two or 
three times on today's students. They have no idea

23:20.862 --> 23:22.624
what I'm talking about. They say it's a different 
era. It

23:24.066 --> 23:34.058
was a little bitty country, I'll call it a 
primitive country convenience store. It was an

23:35.185 --> 23:46.378
old farmer, you know, an old local guy, and that was 
by far the closest place since Brazos County was

23:35.185 --> 23:46.378
dry to hard liquor at that time. Well, I can 
remember us having an outfit at 10, three or four

23:46.558 --> 24:04.618
times, or five or six times, where we went out to 
Whiskey Bridge, and, like, it was still light, and

23:46.558 --> 24:04.618
we went out there and started drinking this drunk 
beer, and we would drop all the animals and go

23:46.558 --> 24:04.618
inside, and you could really,

24:14.622 --> 24:33.087
All right, what else would people drink other than 
beer and

24:14.622 --> 24:33.087
whiskey? All right. And what I'm meaning is that 
all these sophisticated mixed drinks were, that

24:35.150 --> 24:41.959
wasn't part of it. All right. Then in terms of 
smoking, cigarettes, occasionally a cigar. Now,

24:50.712 --> 25:07.113
how much did you and your buddies know then about 
marijuana, cocaine, heroin? Very little. I've

25:11.098 --> 25:13.401
seen a few of us do it a few times about marijuana. 
Where

25:13.837 --> 25:21.225
did it

25:13.837 --> 25:21.225
come from? Where did somebody buy it?

25:46.051 --> 26:02.155
Did you even know the words cocaine and heroin?

26:05.540 --> 26:10.027
We're talking about fun things and so forth. How 
often did you and your buddies go to anything in

26:10.848 --> 26:15.315
Bryan or College Station off campus?

26:33.824 --> 26:48.497
Describe

26:33.824 --> 26:48.497
the bonfire routine during your era. Did you work 
on it? Describe that. It was something that it

26:53.121 --> 27:03.190
seemed like the very first part of bonfire you were 
required to go out and

27:11.152 --> 27:31.065
I

27:11.152 --> 27:31.065
can

27:11.152 --> 27:31.065
remember being real cold and

27:11.152 --> 27:31.065
real wet. I can remember a couple of buddies that 
absolutely just cut school food. That's all there

27:32.808 --> 27:33.209
is. And in retrospect, they've worked that.

27:42.809 --> 27:47.467
So

27:42.809 --> 27:47.467
you were in the cutting room? Correct. Using axes 
or chainsaws?

28:20.137 --> 28:41.014
Thank

28:20.137 --> 28:41.014
you.

28:46.192 --> 28:51.673
What else does bonfire mean? You said words again.

29:46.975 --> 29:53.503
My theory is it's the inclusiveness.

29:54.044 --> 29:55.145
That come on everybody. Nothing else matters 
about income, last name, or anything else. Fish

30:00.993 --> 30:11.086
camp, field practice, muster, bonfire, elephant 
walk, the marching before a football game.

30:14.530 --> 30:16.813
Yeah.

30:18.582 --> 30:23.602
Does any silver taps in your memory have special 
meaning to you? No, but I can remember one silver

30:23.622 --> 30:25.369
tap.

30:47.320 --> 30:53.571
You're saying it bothered your heart, your 
feelings later. That's what I thought you meant.

30:56.156 --> 31:00.764
Did you or any of your buddies cheat? I call it 
cheating. After silver taps, go back and turn on

31:03.009 --> 31:07.938
the lights and do anything? No.

31:21.931 --> 31:32.143
and think how important this next Silver Caps

31:21.931 --> 31:32.143
will be.
