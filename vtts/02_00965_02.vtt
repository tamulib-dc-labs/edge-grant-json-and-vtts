00:02.444 --> 00:10.834
So you talked a little bit about Black Power, but 
what impact do you think that they had then, like

00:02.444 --> 00:10.834
Stokely Carmichael and the Panthers? I think they 
had a, you needed all of those things at the time.

00:16.180 --> 00:18.062
You needed all of those things. I'm not, even 
though it was a, I was philosophically opposed to

00:18.082 --> 00:26.371
the so-called Black Power. You know, one of the 
things that, you know, your parents teach you,

00:26.411 --> 00:30.696
they teach Your parents really teach you right. 
They teach you right. And what my parents told me,

00:34.601 --> 00:38.928
always said, look, you're no better than nobody 
else. And you're no worse than nobody else. You're

00:43.536 --> 00:44.578
the same. You're a man, just like anybody else. You 
put on your pants like them, the same way you bleed

00:47.182 --> 00:52.871
red blood. Your brain, your body. 
Physiologically, it's the same. You just got a

00:58.405 --> 01:01.008
different skin hue in your hair. Maybe a little 
different. But basically, you can take one part

01:03.590 --> 01:09.196
and put it in another person. And I think 
philosophically, the black power thing alluded

01:09.416 --> 01:23.471
to somehow you wanted to dominate and be the person 
on top. But that's not what you really wanted. You

01:25.570 --> 01:27.052
just wanted equal opportunity. Right. Not to 
dominate anybody else, because if you did, you

01:27.813 --> 01:35.425
were no better than the person that you, you know, 
you could just replace one with another. Mm-hmm.

01:37.428 --> 01:49.506
And, uh, but it did scare people of what would 
happen, because there were a lot of places in the

01:37.428 --> 01:49.506
South where blacks were the majority. Mm-hmm. A 
lot of counties, my county, Pike County, Alabama,

01:51.710 --> 01:55.936
blacks were in the majority. My hometown, blacks 
were in the majority of the population. And this

02:00.722 --> 02:04.628
kind of a thing scared those people. And it helped 
galvanize support. Sometimes that, you

02:08.934 --> 02:16.484
know, you wouldn't have gotten. And it also turned 
people against you. That was a place for

02:21.275 --> 02:23.417
everybody. I mean, looking back at it, that was a 
place for everybody. But at the time, trying to

02:29.842 --> 02:50.640
adhere to what Dr. King's philosophy was and what 
have you, this was totally out of kilter with what

02:29.842 --> 02:50.640
those, I guess you might call them, disciples, 
people who would listen to him, and this

02:29.842 --> 02:50.640
nonviolent movement and what have you. a totally 
different way. Totally opposite, right? Yeah,

02:53.002 --> 02:57.309
totally opposite of what he was trying to say or do. 
So, uh, to me and a lot of the people, uh, it was then,

02:57.329 --> 03:07.485
look, if I graduate from college, I want, you know, 
the same opportunity at a job. I want the same pay. I

03:10.110 --> 03:11.151
just stopped by. All right. I'll holler at you. 
Okay. All right. Uh, uh, I want the same

03:19.679 --> 03:21.140
opportunity. I don't want any more. You know, sort 
of like today they talk about quotas and things.

03:30.289 --> 03:40.298
Well, whites interpret this as saying blacks, 
because you're black, you want a white man's job.

03:40.318 --> 03:41.500
That should be an equal number. But nobody, and I 
guess I'm one of the old timers, I guess, now. I

03:47.505 --> 03:49.467
don't want, I'm opposed to quotas. But how else can 
you get an equal number of blacks into a position?

03:58.256 --> 04:00.820
Because people are people. I have a business here. 
Who am I going to hire? Blacks.

04:09.014 --> 04:11.799
You're going to hire people that you know, your 
friends and what have you. And because our society

04:11.839 --> 04:14.644
is, and until Like, I hope my daughters don't have 
to do this. I have to send my daughters to Allen

04:17.713 --> 04:21.137
Academy and Montessori School. And like this 
weekend, a lot of her friends or personal friends

04:21.157 --> 04:29.806
or wife went out to a slumber party and this kind of a 
thing. These kids will have this personal

04:31.267 --> 04:35.472
relationship. I never had that type of, except, 
you know, the fella down the street from me. And it

04:40.637 --> 04:44.361
was a tenuous type thing at best. that we had, you 
know, sometimes. Was that your friend in Alabama?

04:51.070 --> 04:51.230
Yeah. Yeah, it was a tenuous type thing at best, you 
know. Although we felt close to each other, he felt

04:54.215 --> 05:02.047
the pressure from the white community. I felt the 
pressure from the black community. And, you know,

05:06.234 --> 05:11.462
at the time we didn't really understand it, but We 
knew it was something else there, you know, what

05:12.117 --> 05:15.703
was going on. So, you know, that black power thing, 
the philosophy of the black power thing was not

05:15.743 --> 05:28.102
what the old, how do you say it? I don't want to say 
the old, and I sound like I'm ancient and antique.

05:32.388 --> 05:38.057
But the people who were like in the original, in the 
early beginnings of it, who were taught the

05:38.746 --> 05:47.217
nonviolent techniques and procedures and things 
like this, it just didn't sit real well with you. So

05:48.538 --> 05:53.785
you think it was more the younger men, even more the 
ones that were younger? No, I think people like

05:54.406 --> 06:05.460
Carmichael and what have you, they thought that by 
demanding these kind of things and threatening

05:54.406 --> 06:05.460
people and what have you, that they could get more. 
And they did help. But in the end, if you carried it

06:08.918 --> 06:16.305
out to the end, it was self-defeating. If you 
carried what they were saying out to the end, it was

06:16.505 --> 06:22.010
self-defeating. What the nonviolent movement 
strove to do was to make people so ashamed of

06:22.030 --> 06:31.259
themselves that they would do what was right. In 
other words, you changed that person's heart, not

06:31.659 --> 06:36.023
did it Because he had to, or was forced to. You know, 
people who were claiming them. Make the other

06:42.129 --> 06:48.237
people, make the white, or the people that have 
been repressing, feel like, realize what they've

06:42.129 --> 06:48.237
been doing. What they've been doing, yeah. It was 
wrong.

06:53.905 --> 07:00.615
And then when it comes from that person, you have a 
better chance than somebody that's standing up

06:53.905 --> 07:00.615
and wasn't going to make it. Right. Sort of like 
church, you know, parents make you go to church.

07:06.260 --> 07:11.047
But until you have been converted, it doesn't 
really mean much.

07:15.194 --> 07:21.363
So just I guess this is one more thing I just wanted 
to ask you about the Black Panthers. I never knew

07:22.324 --> 07:23.947
much about the Black Panthers. Really? No. That 
was like on the West. They weren't very popular in

07:27.973 --> 07:33.421
the South. No, they weren't. people admired them. 
And you know, they were ultra-vile. But I never, I

07:41.932 --> 07:55.392
met a few of them, but they were just, how do you say, 
they were just too far for me. And I say I, when I say

07:55.432 --> 07:57.495
me, I'm talking about, and maybe I shouldn't, I 
should only speak for myself, but speaking with a

07:57.880 --> 08:10.693
lot of my old friends, like Bill Frazier, John 
Lewis, and people like this, when we talk, we don't

07:57.880 --> 08:10.693
want to do that. You can't win in the end. You just 
can't. The white man controls the military, and

08:16.879 --> 08:23.446
how are you going to win a war? You can't do it.

08:27.412 --> 08:38.689
So we just talked a little bit about some of the 
programs they did in a lot of the ghettos and some of

08:27.412 --> 08:38.689
their social programs as well as we talked a lot 
about there. Did y'all hear more about the

08:39.270 --> 08:43.175
violence or did y'all hear more about the? We heard 
about the social program. But here and again, how

08:45.759 --> 08:52.589
were these things financed? Some people got 
scared. and gave them some money because they

08:56.656 --> 09:00.702
didn't want these niggas to blow this place away. 
Is that how they got a lot of it? A lot of it. I mean,

09:03.707 --> 09:06.431
that's oversimplifying. Right. But

09:06.951 --> 09:16.446
what you wanted, you wanted nobody to take care of 
you. You wanted the ability to do for yourself. And

09:22.355 --> 09:25.920
a lot of that, by doing that, that in and of itself 
still made you a slave that's again that's always

09:26.305 --> 09:53.764
because you were still depending on what somebody 
else it did not give you the the ability to you know

09:26.305 --> 09:53.764
do it for yourself or be yourself and even though 
you had this big gun you were still no better than

09:26.305 --> 09:53.764
the sharecropper who was depending on this man for 
his land and wanted to buy seed and all this kind of

09:54.217 --> 09:59.564
thing. And this is not that I'm out of it and that 
it's removed from it. These are some of the things

10:07.334 --> 10:22.755
that a lot of the young kids, youngsters like 
myself, a lot of the things we discussed when

10:07.334 --> 10:22.755
options and people came around trying to get you to 
start these chapters and look at this, what we

10:07.334 --> 10:22.755
really want to do. And what would have come in the 
end? A lot more violence, I guess, obviously.

10:32.395 --> 10:36.420
Yeah, and what you can't win.

10:36.440 --> 10:54.042
Well, I just wanted to ask you, and I guess some 
wrap-up questions are, I just wanted to ask you

10:36.440 --> 10:54.042
about, well, what impacted the deaths of both 
Malcolm, I mean, since they were both different,

10:36.440 --> 10:54.042
totally opposite extremes, almost, in a lot of 
ways, Malcolm and Martin had on the... especially

10:54.477 --> 11:01.147
Martin, had on the civil rights movement, you 
think, when his death came?

11:02.349 --> 11:11.142
Malcolm's legacy, I think,

11:02.349 --> 11:11.142
came after his death. He had a few followers.

11:16.830 --> 11:23.320
Statistically, there are very few American 
blacks who follow Islam. the Muslim movement,

11:23.671 --> 11:27.615
which he espoused. And even Malcolm himself 
divorced himself from that particular

11:27.695 --> 11:37.925
philosophy, the separatists and all this kind of a 
crowd. So I think that the words Malcolm, like the

11:38.125 --> 11:50.337
book Malcolm X, if you ever read that book, I think 
what he said, even himself was converted in the

11:38.125 --> 11:50.337
end. To his ideal or to Christian or to his ideal? 
What do you mean his ideal? His overall

11:55.758 --> 11:57.440
philosophy. See, the black Muslim preaches this 
thing about separation, and superiority, and all

11:57.580 --> 12:08.591
of this kind of stuff.

12:10.413 --> 12:17.780
Malcolm, you know, in writing this book, it didn't 
quite come out like that. It was a little bit

12:19.542 --> 12:21.083
different. what the so-called

12:21.687 --> 12:27.557
black Muslim movement was about. And most people 
in the black community feel for that reason, why

12:27.758 --> 12:32.726
the Muslim killer. Because he was one of their 
better known spokespersons and what have you. And

12:38.617 --> 12:44.607
for him to break with what they were saying, how do 
you say it?

12:48.400 --> 12:52.466
cast a black eye on what they were espousing. 
Martin Luther King, on the other hand,

12:54.128 --> 13:15.437
I think, not taking anything away from Martin 
Luther King, but I think the time, I think

12:54.128 --> 13:15.437
sometimes events make a man, rather than a man 
making events. Even though King was well prepared

13:16.480 --> 13:27.775
for it and everything like that, I think events and 
people had a lot to do with making King. Of course,

13:27.975 --> 13:34.504
he had the right things to say to take advantage of 
these things and what have you. The loss of King was

13:35.425 --> 13:42.375
a loss

13:35.425 --> 13:42.375
because he affected more people. His way of trying 
to bring about change affected more people. You

13:50.022 --> 13:59.312
take like the women's rights movement came out of 
the civil rights movement, lesbians and gays,

13:50.022 --> 13:59.312
Hispanics. All of these things were like as a 
result of Martin Luther King and the civil rights

14:00.693 --> 14:11.944
movement. So I think King's death

14:16.437 --> 14:23.304
temporarily put a halt to it. Even though some 
people may disagree with me, I think that because

14:23.324 --> 14:39.121
King was so far ahead of his time, he lost a lot of his 
popularity because of issues that he took, like

14:23.324 --> 14:39.121
the Vietnam War. But ultimately, he was right. But 
at the time, when he was saying it, people would

14:43.690 --> 14:47.956
say, hey, this man is unpatriotic. He's a 
communist and all this kind of thing. But he was

14:52.341 --> 14:54.284
right. A lot of things that he said that tarnished 
him while he was living somewhat later proved to be

14:55.205 --> 15:04.578
true. So I think he was a thinker who was having been 
put in that role. He made the best of it. I guess in a

15:14.175 --> 15:17.479
way, it's kind of like Churchill in England. 
Having been put in that role, he had the

15:18.280 --> 15:23.308
wherewithal to handle it. So it was definitely a 
loss to the black community,

15:24.730 --> 15:36.506
particularly symbolically of what the black 
community really want. You had a lot of people

15:37.287 --> 15:42.655
after him who went off in different directions. 
which only helped to divide the movement, I think.

15:49.357 --> 15:59.152
You didn't have a solidarity or one voice or one 
philosophy that had been proven to win. And your

16:01.495 --> 16:04.220
leader, I guess, it just seemed like. Well, I think 
a lot of people look at that a lot differently than I

16:04.340 --> 16:09.908
do. He was symbolic of leadership, but there were 
other men in the South who were, they didn't have a

16:10.445 --> 16:25.028
national following or scope or they were not as 
eloquent as King. But I think a lot of people tend to

16:25.890 --> 16:32.340
think in the black community they got this one 
chief and a whole bunch of Indians. But it's just

16:32.640 --> 16:34.603
like the white community. You got a lot of people 
who think independently. They're not going to

16:38.525 --> 16:39.867
follow anybody. They're going to do what they want 
to do, you know. But I think for the time and for the

16:42.410 --> 16:48.557
60s and whatever, King was the right man. And I 
think that his legacy will live on because not only

16:49.638 --> 17:01.152
was he

16:49.638 --> 17:01.152
good for blacks, he was good for whites. He was good 
for the country. He was a black man, but what he

17:03.455 --> 17:08.481
espoused was good for the country. even though we 
are still struggling with this thing. Just think,

17:14.372 --> 17:27.289
if we didn't spend a lot of our money and time and 
resources on this type of thing, how much better of

17:14.372 --> 17:27.289
a country we would be if we could adequately 
challenge the Japanese.

17:29.952 --> 17:35.920
There's no limit to what we can do, but we spend a lot 
of our energy still

17:37.351 --> 17:40.075
superior and inferior type things. You know, you 
look at the university out there, you hear all

17:40.315 --> 17:50.170
kinds of things about this group going, this 
rights, and all of this kind of a thing. Wasting

17:50.190 --> 17:52.554
time and money. Dr. Mullen would be better 
spending his time, you know, maybe doing

17:52.774 --> 18:04.692
something in the veterinary medicine department 
or whatever. Instead of spending his time with

18:04.992 --> 18:11.021
Ray's relations, that shouldn't even be... So you 
think he should just... I don't think I exactly

18:12.743 --> 18:15.187
understand that. Well, what I'm saying is, when 
you take a lot of your time and energy, take for

18:15.207 --> 18:34.375
instance you and I, or let's say if I own a business, 
and say, if I had to spend a lot of my resources and

18:15.207 --> 18:34.375
time figuring out a way I find I'm going to keep some 
white person out. That's time lost that I could

18:38.922 --> 18:48.431
have been using in a positive manner to make more 
money, et cetera, et cetera, et cetera, et cetera,

18:38.922 --> 18:48.431
et cetera. And I'm saying that we still waste a lot 
of time and money with the problem that,

18:48.871 --> 19:02.404
and yet we have more churches than any place in the 
world. Christian churches anyway. And

19:04.724 --> 19:12.816
we don't live up to what we say we are.

19:18.985 --> 19:22.751
Well, yeah, I understand what you're talking 
about. I mean, I understand where you're coming

19:22.771 --> 19:24.253
from. You know, you go to any church on a Sunday 
morning, it's still the most segregated hour in

19:24.273 --> 19:31.243
the nation. It is, isn't it? And this is where 
everybody's supposed to be equal and right and all

19:34.870 --> 19:40.618
that. I tell people this. I don't only say this to 
whites. I tell people in our church, hey, why don't

19:44.223 --> 19:58.843
we go out and try to get some white converts or 
Hispanic converts?

19:58.923 --> 20:00.505
Even at the daycare, I found it. And I told them that 
if we developed a daycare that was a very good

20:01.109 --> 20:06.336
daycare, whites would come, and they have. In the 
Bryant community? Yeah, out of the church. They

20:11.564 --> 20:13.326
could come to the daycare. We had whites there. 
Hispanics there. But we spent so much time trying

20:18.814 --> 20:21.879
to... Prior to that time, we were trying to keep 
that little thing. It was a good daycare. We were

20:26.706 --> 20:27.707
trying to keep it... to ourselves, you know. But 
here you are, every Sunday morning, you get up

20:29.993 --> 20:38.246
talking about God, and you've been changed, and 
all of this kind of a thing, which, you know,

20:29.993 --> 20:38.246
attracts to it. And that, and that's the whole, 
that's the whole underpinning of the, it seemed

20:40.449 --> 20:52.949
like, to me, I mean, that's a lot of the 
Christianity, or the beliefs and the values of

20:40.449 --> 20:52.949
that were a lot of the whole, under the whole civil 
rights movement. Right. I mean, the non-violence

20:53.290 --> 20:55.213
and Take a page from Jesus. That's all.

21:01.796 --> 21:02.477
Okay. That's really all the questions I had for you 
and stuff. I really enjoyed talking with you. It

21:13.092 --> 21:14.014
was an experience. It was a time. I'm very 
fortunate. I feel very fortunate and happy that I

21:16.918 --> 21:20.644
lived in those times. A pivotal point. so-called 
in American

21:25.771 --> 21:34.542
history. And I feel that I'm a better person as a 
result of it. However, as an American, I can see

21:41.970 --> 21:51.562
that we still have a long ways to go, a lot of things 
to do. And I'm not going to ever waste my energy

21:51.582 --> 21:55.727
hating anybody. I waste my energy in a detrimental 
fashion. I still want equality and everything

22:03.007 --> 22:05.631
like that. But hate and this kind of thing. I heard a 
man say one time that if you're going to keep a pig in

22:11.118 --> 22:20.652
the mud, you have to get in that mud. So if one person 
wanted to hold somebody else down, he got to get

22:23.230 --> 22:27.997
down to that person. You can't stay up there. The 
slave owner, it brought him down a notch or two. He

22:34.866 --> 22:37.130
had to do what he had to do to control his slaves. You 
couldn't take the high road. And as I said, the

22:41.015 --> 22:49.407
lessons that I learned from that period of time

22:51.158 --> 23:02.810
I don't think any schooling or anything could have 
taught me what I learned as a result of it. I'm sure

23:02.830 --> 23:05.353
your children, do you just have one daughter? Oh, I 
have five children. Do you? Yeah. But I'm sure that

23:08.096 --> 23:19.208
they know a lot about, do you think that a lot, for 
the most of the black community realizes, I mean a

23:08.096 --> 23:19.208
lot of the younger generation now, They don't know 
what happened. They don't know what is happening.

23:28.636 --> 23:39.049
I think TV and the instant syndrome has really 
gotten the best of America, black and white.

23:41.993 --> 23:45.718
Because I watch TV, I let my kids watch it, but you 
have to put it in its proper place. We've replaced

23:46.222 --> 23:54.191
instant things with the ability to read and write 
and do mathematics. We've replaced the thought

23:54.231 --> 24:02.061
process with the computer, almost. You don't 
really have to think you're programmed to write

24:02.281 --> 24:11.672
things.

24:14.993 --> 24:16.995
My kids, I try to teach them. I teach them that they 
are black. But they just happen to be black, just

24:22.802 --> 24:28.089
the way the cards were built. There's no 
stigmatism to being that way. And just like

24:32.614 --> 24:35.558
there's no stigmatism to that person being white. 
And I teach them to respect everybody, regardless

24:48.355 --> 24:51.580
We have all kinds of people at my house all the time. 
We had, when the Russian delegation came. Oh, did

24:53.924 --> 24:56.128
y'all have one of the students over there? No, we 
had the whole group at our house, yeah. Really? I

24:58.732 --> 24:59.894
didn't know that. When they came here to the 
university and stuff? Came to the university,

25:02.177 --> 25:04.421
came to our house. We fed them, you know, food. I 
want my kids to know everybody. And when it all

25:09.990 --> 25:14.818
boils down, you know, like my mom and dad told me, 
you know, They bleed red blood, you know. It's

25:19.435 --> 25:20.657
insane. It's just what you yourself choose to be. I 
sure did.

25:29.832 --> 25:34.200
One of my daughters is still in Montessori school. 
Well, both of them are in Montessori school. But

25:37.185 --> 25:41.312
they're friends.

25:42.018 --> 25:47.967
You know, they have Orleans, they have Indians, 
they have everything there. And I want them to know

25:47.987 --> 26:02.648
that even though that school is, how do you say it, 
sort of like an island, it really is the way that

25:47.987 --> 26:02.648
society should be for everybody that accepts. I 
mean, I want them to know what the reality is, but I

26:03.249 --> 26:10.540
also want them to have a feeling of what it should 
be.

26:16.493 --> 26:25.544
I want them to know about the blacks who made 
contributions, but I don't want them to become

26:16.493 --> 26:25.544
immersed in blackness.

26:28.968 --> 26:32.552
Because if you get immersed in blackness, you 
forget about all the other people. Your tunnel

26:33.293 --> 26:34.515
vision. Yeah. I don't want them to do that. I want 
them to know. Like I said, I know it's impossible

26:37.598 --> 26:44.847
under today's circumstances to give them the type 
of education that I got. What do you mean, your

26:45.603 --> 26:49.609
experience education? Yeah, the experience, 
yeah. But, you know, like,

26:52.673 --> 26:58.382
I want them to know people. My daughter knows Ann 
Richards. Ann Richards gave her a letter. Took

27:04.851 --> 27:10.780
pictures with Ann Richards.

27:10.800 --> 27:14.445
She also took pictures with Benjamin Hook. Oh, 
really? I went and heard him speak last, when he

27:16.047 --> 27:18.971
came in. Was that when she went and saw him? Yeah. We 
had a reception for him out of Diagon Alley in

27:21.174 --> 27:23.758
Ramada. Oh. And, you know, I want her to know 
everybody, that a man is a man is a man is a man. You

27:32.190 --> 27:34.012
know, just accept him as that. And then you don't 
get all bogged up on these side issues. You can go

27:39.400 --> 27:40.281
straight ahead. Well, thank you for your time, 
sir. I really appreciate it.
