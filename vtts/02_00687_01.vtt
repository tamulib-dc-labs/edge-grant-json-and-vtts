WEBVTT

00:01.145 --> 00:02.187
I'm excited about it. Today is October the 16th, 
1987. I'm visiting with Dr. James F. McNamara, who

00:05.852 --> 00:16.750
has been at Texas A&M since 1976 and is a professor 
of educational psychology and educational

00:05.852 --> 00:16.750
administration. Dr. McNamara is going to share 
some of his perceptions since his arrival at the

00:17.290 --> 00:27.186
College of Education about the changes and his 
visions of the future possibly and as well as what

00:27.537 --> 00:42.417
is happening in the college right now and how 
impact, how change has impacted the College of

00:27.537 --> 00:42.417
Education and its goals and so forth and how it has 
changed as you arrived. Yeah. Let me make one

00:44.020 --> 00:48.886
correction for you on coming to Texas A&M. I've 
been here twice. I came to Texas A&M in September

00:52.985 --> 01:11.850
1973 from the Advanced Study Center at the 
University of Oregon and stayed two years, sold

00:52.985 --> 01:11.850
everything I owned here, packed up all my baggage 
and went to Columbia University, never to see

00:52.985 --> 01:11.850
Texas A&M again. One year later, I was back at Texas 
A&M and have been here since September 76.

01:23.787 --> 01:37.467
What's I think most important in that is that I came 
back for just one reason, to work with Dean Frank W.

01:23.787 --> 01:37.467
R. Huber. That man had vision for the college and he 
knew the first laws of change. that one needs to

01:45.787 --> 01:57.081
build a fiscally sound enterprise before one goes 
into all the ideas and nuances that would really

01:45.787 --> 01:57.081
put a college on the map. The real specific of that 
is this. We have today the benefits of Frank W.R.

02:01.646 --> 02:13.380
Huber, who funded almost everyone in the early 
years of the college on a 12-month appointment. We

02:14.002 --> 02:28.499
are probably the only college in the United States 
that has the largest percentage of its tenure

02:14.002 --> 02:28.499
track professors on 12, not nine months, 
appointments. And that was done in the very early

02:28.519 --> 02:41.595
years of the college with a whole lot of insight 
that the real first instrument for change is

02:28.519 --> 02:41.595
financial.

02:42.368 --> 02:51.097
If I looked at it and looked at both of the deans that 
we had, I'd have to say that Frank W.R. Hubert built

02:42.368 --> 02:51.097
a fiscally sound college. He did it without 
federal money, without state money, or without

02:52.278 --> 03:01.788
special state funding. He did it all on money that 
accrued to the operating budget of the college,

03:02.288 --> 03:09.135
and we still What is that money? You're talking 
about non-soft money. Yeah. His idea was that you

03:14.641 --> 03:19.187
don't build a permanent college of education with 
soft money. Soft money underwrites some ideas,

03:20.608 --> 03:27.437
but you really build a college with hard money. And 
it's like fixed and variable expenditures. He

03:31.782 --> 03:36.388
just thought that we needed a fixed expenditure 
for the college. And college budgets are very

03:37.128 --> 03:41.854
labor intensive, and they require an enormous 
amount of money. Hubert got that. The second thing

03:44.957 --> 03:50.944
I think that's important with Hubert, and then I'd 
like to say just a little bit about the next theme.

03:52.506 --> 04:02.798
Hubert handpicked

03:52.506 --> 04:02.798
almost every faculty member who came to A&M in the 
formative years.

04:05.748 --> 04:08.812
Do you think he had a special something that he 
looked for in those people? Oh, absolutely. Do you

04:10.053 --> 04:11.755
see something that was across? What is that? I 
think Hubert had what he called the post-hole

04:12.436 --> 04:16.121
theory. It was you invest special monies for 
change in individuals who are entrepreneurial

04:16.141 --> 04:28.296
and thinking and real agents for change, but able 
to venture. A good example of a person that Hubert

04:29.525 --> 04:36.833
Post told in the early days came about the same time 
I did, is Bill Nash. The whole gifted and talented

04:37.594 --> 04:43.661
movement was a personal investment in people such 
as Bill Nash. Bill was not a researcher. Bill was a

04:47.285 --> 04:49.227
program developer. He had another job offer at the 
University of Chicago, but came to Texas A&M. He

04:56.018 --> 05:06.751
was, at the time he came here, on a one-year 
appointment at Texas Southern University

04:56.018 --> 05:06.751
working with minorities and tried to advantage 
their opportunities for schooling.

05:09.774 --> 05:25.873
I think the characteristics of Bill, and 
particularly his interest there, his

05:09.774 --> 05:25.873
programmability, his commitment to working with 
minorities, and last, but I would say most

05:09.774 --> 05:25.873
important, his brand name. institution, the 
University of Georgia. It's one of the key

05:30.641 --> 05:38.729
colleges of education in the United States that 
deals with creativity and assessment measures of

05:30.641 --> 05:38.729
creativity. Bill had all those research skills. 
Earlier in the college days, the dean tried to

05:42.712 --> 05:57.025
pollinate by picking up Hal Hawkins from Harvard, 
Bob Schutz from Stanford, and he was director of

05:42.712 --> 05:57.025
the lab school at Stanford. He picked up Glenn 
Johnson, who was a graduate from Teachers

05:57.832 --> 06:03.058
College. And in the 11th hour, 2300 for the 
military types, every one of these people were

06:03.899 --> 06:16.272
good researchers, but with a specific vision and a 
fairly clear-cut idea of where they wanted to be in

06:03.899 --> 06:16.272
the college.

06:19.716 --> 06:27.805
Mike Ash was recruited, now the department head of 
Ed Psych, to get child development in those areas

06:19.716 --> 06:27.805
leveraged. I came in educational administration 
to get research going in administration. This is

06:35.152 --> 06:39.099
nuanced, but it's probably important when you 
listen to the tape and you go back. I can tell you

06:40.121 --> 06:44.308
real quick, in about a minute or two, how I ended up 
at Texas A&M. And it really all states Hubert's

06:45.450 --> 06:52.543
radar to find people with certain 
characteristics.

06:54.228 --> 07:02.618
I had never heard of Texas A&M, but they were 
looking for a person to head up the planning,

06:54.228 --> 07:02.618
research, and evaluation efforts here in the 
college. And they had a job description for a full

07:03.519 --> 07:06.003
professor. I sat down and wrote one afternoon at 
the Advanced Studies Center five pages about what

07:07.064 --> 07:20.961
I thought planning, research, and evaluation 
should be in a college of education, sent it to

07:07.064 --> 07:20.961
Texas A&M, and with only three years out of 
graduate school, asking for a full

07:21.278 --> 07:25.266
professorship.

07:28.753 --> 07:43.422
Hubert hired me, never interviewed anyone else 
for the job, asked me to come and think on my feet in a

07:28.753 --> 07:43.422
seminar for the faculty without any presentation 
or forewarning. Two years after I came to Texas

07:44.785 --> 07:59.124
A&M, I found out that the reason why I was brought to 
Texas A&M was one, the reasons were, one, because

07:44.785 --> 07:59.124
of the letter and the vision, but two, the 
verification. His cousin was a professor of

07:59.945 --> 08:07.795
educational administration at the University of 
Kansas, or Kansas State. And when my letter

08:09.097 --> 08:12.902
arrived with Hubert, he called his cousin, And his 
cousin told him what my skills were, what I was

08:14.080 --> 08:24.775
doing at the Advanced Study Center, and that I was 
probably one of the largest possible outliers

08:14.080 --> 08:24.775
that could exist in any event. Because 75 of my 90 
hours in graduate preparation were all

08:25.416 --> 08:32.506
mathematics. And that my three-year history was 
in research, both theoretical and empirical. And

08:37.273 --> 08:39.396
he had checked through that far. long before he had 
me here on the campus. It was on the strength of that

08:42.582 --> 08:45.006
that he canceled the search. But my example for 
your tape is that the man spent an enormous amount

08:46.448 --> 08:54.341
of effort locating profs. If you look at the 
demography of that, the profs that he hired are

08:55.983 --> 09:01.592
still here. By and large, 90% of the people that 
were hired Between 1969 and 1976, when I came back

09:07.996 --> 09:14.766
to Texas A&M, are still here. They're 
individually productive. They not only wear a

09:18.151 --> 09:21.335
department hat, they wear a college hat. And they 
sell their soul to the college, to its

09:22.537 --> 09:27.845
advancement. They're personally renowned and 
recognized in their own fields. The man just had an

09:31.971 --> 09:33.914
ingenious sense. Thank you. So not only did he 
develop a fiscally sound college, but in the

09:35.182 --> 09:43.791
process of doing that, he found the people. That's 
what makes the college, is the people. And when I

09:48.175 --> 10:03.231
came to Texas A&M, the first two years I was here, 
from this post-hoeing theory I gave you, he gave me

09:48.175 --> 10:03.231
$17,000 of unconverted money to use as I saw fit to 
advance research in college. And long before some

10:05.438 --> 10:19.201
of the superstars like Vic Wilson, Gwyneth Badu, 
and Cecil Reynolds from our department, he was

10:05.438 --> 10:19.201
already investing in a couple of people. Bill Nash 
is an example. John Denton and I, in 1979, were

10:21.826 --> 10:31.362
given a whole summer off to do anything we wanted to 
do that we thought was important to influence the

10:32.202 --> 10:39.214
future development of research in the college. I 
took the whole summer off on full pay and went to the

10:40.216 --> 10:48.310
University of Michigan as a visiting scholar and 
learned survey research. John went over to the

10:49.612 --> 10:55.442
Texas R&D Center in Austin. Three years later, 
John was back here and was president of the Texas

10:56.232 --> 11:01.638
Association of Plain Evaluation Research. And 
ever since that time, he's leveraged the

11:02.299 --> 11:08.166
advantage for research in the Southwest region 
for Texas A&M. So then the mission of the teaching,

11:08.987 --> 11:17.536
research, and service, which is what the mission 
of the college is now, was very much in place at the

11:08.987 --> 11:17.536
time. It actually started when the college 
started. And has the emphasis shifted any from

11:20.900 --> 11:25.986
teaching, research, and service? Yeah, yeah. I 
would say that there's been a real growing

11:27.743 --> 11:30.706
emphasis on research. Here's my model. When I came 
here, I shared with Hubert that I thought it took 25

11:32.868 --> 11:46.383
years to build a college of education of the 
stature of a Stanford, a Harvard, an Illinois, a

11:32.868 --> 11:46.383
Wisconsin, a Minnesota. Are we going to get there? 
Yeah, we're pretty close. I said there were really

11:50.427 --> 11:55.112
three phases, and each of them had about a 10-year 
cycle. But over a quarter of a century, that means

11:56.341 --> 12:02.492
some of those are overlapping, if you can 
visualize what I'm saying. You can just put these

12:02.552 --> 12:05.877
three 10-year bars. The first part of the plan to 
build a college is to have service. And Hubert did

12:12.068 --> 12:13.170
that. The next thing... Well, I'm sorry, I really 
think the first piece of it is teaching. I'm sorry,

12:21.193 --> 12:29.221
I didn't... And Hubert hired people who could 
really teach in graduate professional

12:21.193 --> 12:29.221
education. And so the first ten years were really 
devoted to teaching. Research was done off the end

12:32.684 --> 12:40.212
of the bench, so its weight was pretty small. About 
seven or eight years down that 25-year cycle, he

12:40.232 --> 12:46.058
started to do some service work. In the process of 
thinking of service, they started to think about

12:47.523 --> 12:55.572
evaluation designs, technical assistance. And 
these things became the fodder and the lubricants

12:56.794 --> 13:04.502
that started the third cycle, which would be 
research. So if you go back and look at the

13:05.323 --> 13:14.434
transactions of the college, you can use the model 
I just gave you, and you can see that 20 years later,

13:05.323 --> 13:14.434
all three of those things are in place. Teaching is 
pretty well anchored. Services growing even now

13:16.885 --> 13:44.496
with the school university collaborative some of 
your service activity that be linked to the

13:16.885 --> 13:44.496
minority recruitment The whole gifted and 
talented program service area the special ed

13:16.885 --> 13:44.496
service areas A lot of the service is pretty well 
anchored and it's gearing to research Now the

13:16.885 --> 13:44.496
research is almost in place and what we're finding 
is a lot of the theoretical research we work on is

13:16.885 --> 13:44.496
not research that came from the ideas of 
individuals, but rather are coming out of this

13:44.915 --> 13:53.125
joint collaborative college mission. Victor 
Wilson's a good example. Vic started to work with

13:56.068 --> 14:01.875
the computer program and the gifted and talented 
and working with very young youth. This is a

14:02.796 --> 14:03.677
professor? Yeah, Vic Wilson's a fellow in 
extracurricular and he's one of our

14:03.798 --> 14:07.262
statisticians. Vic is probably the, he's one of 
the top three researchers of the college. But Vic

14:13.012 --> 14:19.664
started to work with the service activities of the 
Gifted and Talented Program. And from that now,

14:20.766 --> 14:31.466
they're doing some very theoretical research 
relating to measurement, which will detect in

14:20.766 --> 14:31.466
early stages, in early youth, genius. Pat 
Alexander's involved in that. Now, it's so

14:35.928 --> 14:45.181
naturally confounded with these service things, 
the second or the third stage, that you never know

14:35.928 --> 14:45.181
it. Tell me who the three top researchers are 
considered in the college. I know you're one of

14:51.750 --> 14:53.352
them. That's a tough one. That's a really tough 
one. Well,

14:54.814 --> 14:58.459
there's a lot. I say that Vic's top because Vic... 
is as theoretical as any researcher in the

15:02.877 --> 15:06.023
college. And he's also as practical as any 
researcher in the college. His portfolio of

15:10.812 --> 15:18.026
insights and skills are just as valuable 
theoretically as they are empirically. If you ask

15:18.667 --> 15:22.675
me for the top three, there are a couple in the 
college who are very good theoretically. have no

15:23.296 --> 15:26.080
interest in collaborative research in the field. 
They are sort of what they call in mathematics and

15:26.100 --> 15:30.426
science is pioneering. They're doing the 
frontier research. Well, I think you will be my

15:34.551 --> 15:38.958
only source, or my best source, on the researching 
part of the college. So I would give you those

15:38.998 --> 15:41.681
insights. I would say, if you would have asked me 
this question in 1978, or even ask Hubert, Hubert

15:48.305 --> 15:50.447
would have said John Denton and Jim McNamara. And 
those were the two that he invested in. Since that

15:54.933 --> 16:00.239
time, I'd like to say that there are about five or 
six that I would put in an orbit and not rank order.

16:00.379 --> 16:14.835
And that would be Victor Wilson, John Denton, 
Gwyneth Padoo, Cecil Reynolds, Ernie Goetz, and

16:00.379 --> 16:14.835
Jim McNamara. Now, notice that the largest 
concentration of those researchers is at Ed

16:16.722 --> 16:20.526
Psych. So if you really want to follow the research 
transactions of the college, the premier push

16:21.567 --> 16:28.735
came out of Ed Psych. Now, that was one of the most, I 
wouldn't say devastating, but defeating notions

16:30.797 --> 16:38.485
for Hubert. Because Frank Hubert wanted the 
educational administration department in this

16:38.505 --> 16:44.772
college to be premier. All his training was in 
administration, both educational and public

16:46.675 --> 16:54.810
administration, and in history and governance. 
And originally, he thought that the ed admin

16:55.872 --> 17:04.789
department here would be just an outstanding 
research department. I would say it's a very good

17:05.310 --> 17:10.860
service department, the principal center being a 
good example. Of some of the recent, yeah. And

17:14.198 --> 17:23.653
another really superior example would be the 
almost $2 million that were invested in the

17:14.198 --> 17:23.653
community education center. None of that money, 
incidentally, was ever sidetracked, like

17:25.816 --> 17:32.486
corporations would do with about 5% of their 
working capital put in R&D. That never happened in

17:33.047 --> 17:40.358
the Mott Foundation efforts. but a tremendous 
service effort. The premier research

17:44.341 --> 17:50.290
department, I'll say it again, it's like he didn't 
expect that originally. If you move on now, and

17:50.310 --> 17:54.817
then I'll come back and take any specific 
questions you want. When Corrigan came to the

17:56.099 --> 18:02.008
college, Corrigan inherited a fiscally sound 
college. And I would go so far as to say, in terms of

18:03.220 --> 18:16.779
faculty morale and underwriting, financial 
underwriting, the best and the most visibly sound

18:03.220 --> 18:16.779
college in Asia, given all those full-time 
employment, 12-month contracts. He also

18:18.722 --> 18:23.970
inherited an enormous amount of talent. His 
leadership style was so dramatically different

18:23.990 --> 18:31.320
than Corrigan's that people started to rise to the 
occasion. He had the little near mnemonic which

18:32.650 --> 18:38.498
said, sharing, daring, and caring. And his 
objective, I think, which was embedded in all that

18:40.441 --> 18:49.173
rhetoric, was to make, to create two colleges.

18:51.797 --> 18:56.584
A formal college where people reside, 
departments, and where they get their money. And

18:57.145 --> 19:00.109
then what I would call the idea college, And the 
idea college was the inquiry groups. So inquiry

19:06.589 --> 19:13.390
groups are like departments, but they're 
adhocracies in Toffler's sense, rather than

19:06.589 --> 19:13.390
formal departments. Are they still very active? I 
mean, I know he initiated, but have they

19:16.193 --> 19:19.577
maintained that momentum? I would suggest that 
you couldn't put your finger on the inquiry groups

19:19.598 --> 19:26.908
as they were established. That was my meaning in 
the autocracies. What Corrigan wanted to do was to

19:30.554 --> 19:41.149
bring researchers with common interests 
together, quite independent of the departments,

19:30.554 --> 19:41.149
and to get them speaking with each other. and 
getting to undertake some common endeavors. And

19:45.153 --> 19:45.974
did that happen? Oh, yeah. That happened. And it 
was a very, very effective strategy. But I don't

19:49.179 --> 19:56.309
think the inquiry group orientation needed to be 
long-lasting. It was more a development of a

19:56.330 --> 20:00.356
kinship, a professional kinship. Hi. Hi, Ann. 
Yeah, I'm right in the middle of an interview. OK,

20:06.785 --> 20:08.468
can I come back later? Yeah, about 3.30, I'll be 
around.

20:12.938 --> 20:21.092
No, those things are not very active for my money, 
but what people have done is come together and are

20:12.938 --> 20:21.092
working on common things. Is that a collaborative 
effort within departments or with other

20:22.013 --> 20:25.660
colleges? I think to even link it to departments is 
really counterproductive to what the inquiry

20:25.880 --> 20:31.670
groups accomplished. It brought people together 
with people. That's what I meant by the kinship.

20:36.097 --> 20:37.680
But not necessarily even... people within, or are 
they all in the college? Are they working with

20:40.422 --> 20:42.085
other people? Oh, yeah. No, they're 
predominantly in the college. And I would say that

20:43.647 --> 21:00.732
several of the department heads in the college 
systematically resisted the whole notion of

20:43.647 --> 21:00.732
inquiry because it made information and 
scholarly productivity and activity valuable in

20:43.647 --> 21:00.732
its own right. Did it conflict with their 
philosophy? Did each department have a very

21:03.554 --> 21:06.799
distinct philosophy that conflicted with that? 
Or was the philosophy the same, but just the way

21:06.819 --> 21:10.264
they went about doing things? Oh, I think entirely 
different. Each department? Entirely

21:12.788 --> 21:13.569
different. I would say that Ed Psych, for example, 
just wanted to work with inquiry in every way they

21:13.589 --> 21:20.780
could. And you'll find its faculty were in every 
inquiry group. On the other hand, I can tell you two

21:27.897 --> 21:35.270
departments that almost penalized faculty for 
joining inquiry groups. Now, I would say that's

21:35.550 --> 21:40.659
the difference in philosophy.

21:40.679 --> 21:41.120
That's interesting. And when you turn the tape 
recorder off, I'll tell you the departments. But

21:44.145 --> 21:48.853
I'll tell you where you can get that information 
and answer that question in a really neat way. Dave

21:49.514 --> 21:52.960
Erlandson did a study on that. And what you find is I 
think there are four different, a couple of

21:53.260 --> 21:57.205
different profiles. And there are even a couple of 
different types of inquiry groups that were

21:57.245 --> 22:03.492
designated and emerging. I chaired one of the 
designated inquiry groups that led to this

22:03.512 --> 22:11.502
whole computer idea in the college. It was called 
the Inquiry Group on Research Assistance in

22:12.003 --> 22:16.708
Computer Technology. And that stayed together 
for about four years. And we were very

22:21.053 --> 22:26.758
instrumental outside of the department 
structure in recommending how money got spent for

22:21.053 --> 22:26.758
computers. And in some cases, the faculty were 
much more likely than departments to pool their

22:28.220 --> 22:33.705
resources when they needed big things. 
Departments compete. Inquiry group members

22:34.886 --> 22:37.769
pool. It's a nice contrast. And the dean sort of 
sanctioned that. He just sort of fanned the fumes,

22:42.093 --> 22:46.618
the flames, and worked that. And it really upset 
some of the department heads. Well, because it was

22:50.230 --> 22:55.137
so, I mean, it had not been done before, and it was 
just such a drastic change, like you said. And

22:55.778 --> 22:58.041
that's unique to this dean. And that's why I'm 
looking at this study as two distinct eras, with

22:58.061 --> 23:03.468
the interim year with Dr. Limbacher. But it was 
definitely a Hubert era, and there is now a

23:03.869 --> 23:10.638
Corrigan era, and they each are unique in their 
own. Well, I would say Corrigan's success was

23:10.818 --> 23:18.609
pretty well, could be predicted from the legacy 
that was left to him. Mm-hmm. from prior

23:19.778 --> 23:21.100
administration. I mean, not only that Chancellor 
Hubert, but the endorsement of the university.

23:26.807 --> 23:36.138
OK. Now, from going from administration to the 
student body, and we're hearing a lot now about the

23:26.807 --> 23:36.138
standards at A&M and how it's affecting the 
students that we get now. It has grown

23:36.759 --> 23:39.422
tremendously, even since you've been here. What 
do you see as far as, has it affected the way you get

23:39.502 --> 23:48.013
to work with students now that there's so many more 
students and now that they're coming in? with much

23:48.280 --> 23:51.196
higher standards are getting higher and higher. 
Are we weeding out people that really need to be in

23:51.458 --> 23:54.676
this college? Do you think the standards are 
higher? For graduate instruction? Now than they

23:57.133 --> 23:58.776
were 10 years ago? Because I don't think that's 
true. No, I guess I'm going more with the fact that

24:00.638 --> 24:04.645
the standards for admission are now going up 
higher. Graduate admission? No, undergraduate.

24:07.129 --> 24:08.210
No, graduate is not. That's right. You are 
strictly... Last year was the first time I taught a

24:09.572 --> 24:19.428
graduate course at Texas A&M, and I worked with 
some of the math scholar students, undergraduate

24:09.572 --> 24:19.428
math scholar, and will continue to work with them. 
That was the first undergraduate? First

24:20.950 --> 24:22.152
undergraduate course. I'm in two departments, 
neither one of which has an undergraduate

24:22.739 --> 24:28.707
program.

24:28.747 --> 24:39.280
But I would say that there are only a couple of 
occasions that I'd point to where the graduate

24:28.747 --> 24:39.280
admissions standards are tougher now. And 
there's one very obvious case in the college.

24:42.604 --> 24:47.110
That's Ed Psych Counseling Program.

24:47.663 --> 24:57.896
person that they select on an annual basis for a 
four-year residency to complete a degree, there

24:47.663 --> 24:57.896
are seven to eight people standing in line waiting 
for that position. I don't know if you know that

24:57.916 --> 24:59.257
they're that good.

25:02.421 --> 25:02.622
Fantastic. Another case where the enrollment 
standards have jumped astronomically is in

25:03.122 --> 25:08.869
school psych. I mean, the quality of students, 
school psych. And that's a new program. Now, both

25:13.315 --> 25:17.400
of those are APA approved. In universities, there 
are four types of APA programs, clinical, school

25:18.038 --> 25:25.245
and counseling, and industrial psych. Those are 
the only four basic. We have two of the four in this

25:27.247 --> 25:30.391
department. And some of the most recent ratings on 
both counseling and school psych say we're up

25:30.411 --> 25:37.278
there running with the best in the country. Now, 
those things have really changed the type of

25:37.558 --> 25:43.624
students that I've worked with. I find that these 
students, although they come originally without

25:44.549 --> 25:55.942
a large predilection and appetite for research, 
very quickly shift gears. So that was something

25:55.962 --> 26:04.711
that you mentioned earlier, too, about the fact 
that how we are perceived by other universities

25:55.962 --> 26:04.711
and outside this college. So you've answered it a 
couple of times now by what you're talking about

26:04.771 --> 26:14.522
the students and then also what you referenced 
before about the fact that we're almost there with

26:04.771 --> 26:14.522
these goals that you that you kind of projected 
back 25 or 20 years ago or 18 years ago? I'd say we're

26:19.286 --> 26:25.774
almost there, but I can tell you some things that 
are really dragging weight on making this a

26:19.286 --> 26:25.774
research university. What's that? I'd say it's 
the Ed Admin Department. The what? The Ed Admin

26:29.419 --> 26:30.260
Department. I think the Ed Admin Department is 
still in a service mode in terms of students. In

26:35.166 --> 26:40.392
fact, I think there are over 200 students who are 
just sort of, don't quote me on this, But there's a

26:40.591 --> 26:47.401
large number of students, I've heard the number 
200, who are not degree students but are

26:40.591 --> 26:47.401
certification students. Now, these folks are 
shopping around. They shop for courses. They'll

26:54.691 --> 27:00.920
take anything we offer in San Antonio, if they're 
from San Antonio, and then work it to a degree, to a

26:54.691 --> 27:00.920
certification plan. They'll take what they can 
get here. But by and large, they're not degree

27:03.304 --> 27:10.294
students.

27:10.358 --> 27:13.283
So do you see that as a holding back? If the 
objective is to become a major research

27:14.144 --> 27:18.412
university. I'm not saying that's just... And is 
it? Is that the objective? That was Dean Corrigan.

27:24.342 --> 27:25.704
I mean, he mentioned that in his initial... I would 
say any time the rhetoric leaves the college and

27:25.724 --> 27:31.534
moves towards the university, that you're going 
to get that said. Mm-hmm. Sure. I think Corrigan's

27:33.950 --> 27:43.164
idea, if he speaks to central administration, 
he's got to get on the same wavelength, in the same

27:33.950 --> 27:43.164
orbit that the university's in. So the rhetoric 
that way is going to go. It'll go. I would think that

27:46.289 --> 27:59.569
the rhetoric in a college, at least some of 
Corrigan's rhetoric, would suggest that there's

27:46.289 --> 27:59.569
an effort to create one profession, and that 
people in the schools and people in the university

27:46.289 --> 27:59.569
ought to be more formally linked. that they're in a 
profession. And what the college should be having

28:02.352 --> 28:06.517
as its objective is the betterment of the 
profession. And the betterment of the

28:07.818 --> 28:16.828
profession, if you follow its logic, can't be any 
better than the quality of what we do for students

28:07.818 --> 28:16.828
in any kind of academic environment. But I've 
heard that rhetoric. And that's not directly

28:20.612 --> 28:23.735
influenced by research. The connection between 
research and the day-to-day world of schools is

28:24.096 --> 28:28.881
much more immediate than immediate. I think we 
cheat a little bit on that one, to call it college

28:29.873 --> 28:33.137
research. But I still don't think we're in the full 
third phase of what it takes in the first quarter

28:33.317 --> 28:43.309
century to make an orange university. But we're 
getting there. And is there a search out there for

28:44.691 --> 28:50.939
people that will help to get there, to help us to get 
there? I mean, is there an active search for kinds

28:51.019 --> 28:56.746
of people that are interested in those kinds of 
areas where it will? I'd say that efforts in the

28:57.306 --> 28:59.509
Development Council our efforts to try and find 
more resources and more opportunity and more

28:59.725 --> 29:07.474
advocacy for the research, for the research 
members of the college. And for the service, but

29:08.435 --> 29:10.297
for the research, yeah. I see that as a useful 
transaction. I think the school-university

29:12.239 --> 29:18.927
collaborative research that we've started is 
probably one of the most exciting things that has

29:12.239 --> 29:18.927
come down the pike. And I think it... Sorry I didn't 
make it to that meeting, but I do want to keep in

29:19.788 --> 29:24.754
touch with that. I do think that that's going to 
have a dramatic impact in the next three years in

29:25.655 --> 29:29.479
the college. I think it might replace some of the 
activities of inquiry group.

29:35.634 --> 29:59.415
What are some of the highlights, looking back now, 
in the past and in the present, I'm interested in

29:35.634 --> 29:59.415
what you feel have been your greatest 
contributions, which obviously are in the

29:35.634 --> 29:59.415
research field, but maybe a couple of insights or 
observations that you have, and you shared some

29:35.634 --> 29:59.415
really neat ones today, that as somebody looks at 
this maybe 20 or 30 years from now and looks at Yeah,

29:59.885 --> 30:02.695
here's some tangents that you probably wouldn't 
get elsewhere. Okay, that's what I want. When we

30:04.722 --> 30:08.275
had the search for Dean Carter, it was... Hold on, 
let me transfer the...
