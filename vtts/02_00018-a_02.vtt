WEBVTT

00:00:03.220 --> 00:00:08.728
As you look back on the department in the 70s, there was strength in tectonophysics.

00:00:09.749 --> 00:00:18.021
What were the other research areas of recognition by the A&M Department of Geology?

00:00:18.602 --> 00:00:30.358
Probably petroleum, reservoir, what we call reservoir characterization, description of the reservoirs, which of course leads to other things involved.

00:00:31.148 --> 00:00:34.214
Who were the key people in those specialties?

00:00:34.234 --> 00:00:34.835
I was.

00:00:34.855 --> 00:00:35.477
Okay.

00:00:35.497 --> 00:00:46.679
And several other people who came.

00:00:46.739 --> 00:00:52.971
So there were a number of us.

00:00:53.710 --> 00:00:57.035
Geographically, where were you all doing?

00:00:58.097 --> 00:00:59.319
What areas were you studying?

00:01:00.501 --> 00:01:00.681
Anyplace.

00:01:00.701 --> 00:01:01.343
All over the world?

00:01:03.166 --> 00:01:12.841
All over the United States.

00:01:12.861 --> 00:01:16.968
You know what cores look like?

00:01:16.988 --> 00:01:17.810
I was looking at some stuff this morning.

00:01:17.850 --> 00:01:20.494
In California, I described it.

00:01:20.660 --> 00:01:28.451
on a consulting basis and interpreted about 2,000 feet in the southern San Joaquin Basin.

00:01:28.471 --> 00:01:33.698
And the Delaware Basin in West Texas, another 2,000 feet there.

00:01:34.799 --> 00:01:45.194
And probably another 5,000 feet adding up everything from Montana to Mississippi and mostly Texas.

00:01:45.214 --> 00:01:46.836
So we've processed a lot of rock.

00:01:48.487 --> 00:02:01.021
And so this research that you've mentioned so far I as an outsider would describe as real world applied geology.

00:02:01.041 --> 00:02:01.842
Yes.

00:02:03.263 --> 00:02:05.386
Was that general throughout the entire department?

00:02:06.967 --> 00:02:08.529
No.

00:02:08.549 --> 00:02:10.791
The older group of faculty didn't do any research.

00:02:14.816 --> 00:02:14.916
Okay.

00:02:15.200 --> 00:02:25.252
of course they published multiple papers.

00:02:25.272 --> 00:02:33.662
And I hired Chris Mathewson, I think about 1970.

00:02:33.682 --> 00:02:38.187
We looked for, and this was Earl Cook's

00:02:39.905 --> 00:02:50.140
He saw engineering geology, which is the geology of shallow structures, bridges and tunnels and all that stuff.

00:02:50.160 --> 00:03:01.315
And we started to interview some people, and some of the best ones that were consulting were having a heyday in this business.

00:03:01.335 --> 00:03:04.360
They wouldn't even consider coming back back then.

00:03:04.380 --> 00:03:09.507
So, as a substitute, we hired Chris Matteson, who went on a Ph.D.

00:03:10.077 --> 00:03:24.374
I've got to say, he did a remarkable job over the years in building up an engineering-geology group with several people working with him, cooperation with civil engineering.

00:03:24.394 --> 00:03:27.778
And so that would be the other promise I'd call it.

00:03:27.878 --> 00:03:31.723
We call it engineering-geology.

00:03:31.743 --> 00:03:33.745
I know you could call it environmental.

00:03:33.765 --> 00:03:35.207
Oh, OK. OK.

00:03:37.212 --> 00:03:37.472
All right.

00:03:37.492 --> 00:03:49.924
Do you remember in the 70s and 80s any research proposal approval that caused all of y'all to celebrate that this was really a big one?

00:03:52.366 --> 00:03:53.367
No, I really don't.

00:03:53.387 --> 00:03:53.947
You don't remember?

00:03:53.987 --> 00:03:58.071
They were all pretty big.

00:03:58.091 --> 00:03:58.452
Is that right?

00:03:58.672 --> 00:04:05.498
What would have been in the 70s the average departmental research budget total?

00:04:09.089 --> 00:04:10.290
A million or more?

00:04:13.655 --> 00:04:16.598
Must have been over a million.

00:04:16.778 --> 00:04:21.264
And the enrollment, what happened to the enrollment, undergraduate and graduate?

00:04:21.905 --> 00:04:29.494
Well, enrollment began to increase after I got here.

00:04:29.754 --> 00:04:32.057
And hiring increased.

00:04:32.097 --> 00:04:37.524
And of course, after the Arab embargo, things ballooned.

00:04:37.544 --> 00:04:37.864
Price increased.

00:04:38.536 --> 00:04:40.698
a lot more exploration.

00:04:40.718 --> 00:04:46.183
And that lasted until about 1986, when the crisis stopped.

00:04:47.644 --> 00:04:53.790
And in the boom years, it was really terrible.

00:04:53.810 --> 00:05:02.378
In the early 80s, at one point, we had 300 freshmen, declared freshmen.

00:05:02.398 --> 00:05:04.740
And we didn't know what to do with the whole group.

00:05:04.760 --> 00:05:06.522
So we started a little seminar.

00:05:06.542 --> 00:05:08.003
Everybody took a couple hours.

00:05:08.573 --> 00:05:12.579
went in and told some aspect of geology.

00:05:12.599 --> 00:05:15.885
Of course, I did professional practice.

00:05:15.905 --> 00:05:20.332
Then the subject of salaries came up, and I hear that's a mob of people.

00:05:20.352 --> 00:05:25.580
I think there were 300 total enrolled, 90 majors, 90 freshmen.

00:05:26.802 --> 00:05:30.908
So I had to look out to see freshmen.

00:05:31.850 --> 00:05:36.437
I said, how many of you are registered in geology because you think you're going to get a good job?

00:05:36.957 --> 00:05:48.993
And there was a forest of hands.

00:05:49.013 --> 00:05:52.878
I said, how many of you are here because you like rocks?

00:05:52.898 --> 00:05:53.098
Two girls.

00:05:53.118 --> 00:05:55.060
So it follows pretty closely.

00:05:55.201 --> 00:06:00.848
In those years, what were the key undergraduate courses that a geology major took?

00:06:01.669 --> 00:06:06.475
There must have been some that were kind of the gateway courses where that

00:06:08.193 --> 00:06:11.738
They either stayed with it after that or decided to go somewhere else.

00:06:13.681 --> 00:06:18.848
Well, the second year course is mineralogy.

00:06:18.868 --> 00:06:23.735
It's always kind of the elimination course.

00:06:23.755 --> 00:06:32.147
Students can come in and take the freshman in the beginning geology, historical geology, physical and historical.

00:06:32.167 --> 00:06:36.293
But in the next year, they have to get into the crystallography and

00:06:36.982 --> 00:06:49.134
And that wipes out a good number of my students.

00:06:49.154 --> 00:06:51.797
And we de-emphasize that now that it used to be a very major part of the curriculum.

00:06:51.817 --> 00:06:53.619
Who taught that second course?

00:06:55.841 --> 00:06:58.484
Who taught those introductory sections the first year?

00:07:00.746 --> 00:07:02.348
The older faculty primarily.

00:07:02.699 --> 00:07:08.691
Was there any of them that was supposedly legendary, according to the students in their teaching?

00:07:09.994 --> 00:07:22.039
Yeah, Fred Smith.

00:07:22.059 --> 00:07:23.121
Yeah, Fred was...

00:07:24.451 --> 00:07:44.974
Did the students have a nickname for him?

00:07:46.456 --> 00:07:48.298
You know, there were legendary nicknames.

00:07:50.740 --> 00:07:53.023
I was wondering if there might have been in the

00:07:53.341 --> 00:07:56.385
Surely there are too many possibilities in geology.

00:07:56.405 --> 00:07:57.146
There must have been.

00:08:01.331 --> 00:08:16.050
You said the enrollment tended to follow the market, the oil market, so that you're implying that most of the geology students saw this as petroleum-related.

00:08:20.716 --> 00:08:22.198
Yes, or job opportunities.

00:08:22.218 --> 00:08:23.179
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

00:08:24.087 --> 00:08:50.854
Looking back over these 30 years plus that you've been here, which corporations have been most positive in their support of the geology program at Texas A&M?

00:08:54.665 --> 00:08:57.067
Oh, that's a tough one.

00:08:57.087 --> 00:08:58.989
I can only speak from my own research.

00:08:59.209 --> 00:09:03.272
Tentacle was my major support.

00:09:03.292 --> 00:09:04.713
And I like the way they operate.

00:09:05.014 --> 00:09:06.495
I like their organization.

00:09:06.515 --> 00:09:07.976
I taught short courses from them.

00:09:08.577 --> 00:09:11.279
I did a lot of consulting.

00:09:11.299 --> 00:09:20.246
They're present, of course, with Maggie, Jill Foster.

00:09:20.266 --> 00:09:24.570
So for me, that was the mainstay of my research.

00:09:25.411 --> 00:09:28.435
But there must have been others you can think of that supported.

00:09:29.437 --> 00:09:30.538
There were a number of others.

00:09:30.558 --> 00:09:34.564
Yeah, I taught short courses either out lecturing or here.

00:09:35.165 --> 00:09:37.548
They were one-week courses.

00:09:37.568 --> 00:09:43.096
They went through my whole core collection.

00:09:43.116 --> 00:09:43.317
All right.

00:09:43.337 --> 00:09:44.138
Quite popular.

00:09:44.438 --> 00:09:46.701
And finally I opened.

00:09:47.783 --> 00:09:48.945
I started with the Teneca.

00:09:48.965 --> 00:09:49.525
I started with the Chevron.

00:09:49.546 --> 00:09:51.588
But then it became largely a Teneca course.

00:09:51.829 --> 00:09:53.812
Finally I left it open.

00:09:53.952 --> 00:09:54.793
I had mobile courses.

00:09:55.465 --> 00:10:03.939
What was your favorite course to teach?

00:10:08.166 --> 00:10:08.667
What were they?

00:10:09.549 --> 00:10:18.444
One was called Stratigraphy, but it really was the geology of reservoir sandstone.

00:10:18.464 --> 00:10:20.427
And the second course was Petroleum Geology.

00:10:21.773 --> 00:10:25.517
The students who took these were normally what level academically?

00:10:26.278 --> 00:10:31.003
Graduate students.

00:10:31.443 --> 00:10:34.827
And what was your intent in those courses?

00:10:34.887 --> 00:10:36.489
What were you hoping to do?

00:10:38.371 --> 00:10:39.372
What were you hoping to?

00:10:40.673 --> 00:10:48.642
Well, I guess I really hoped that I could train them to do work involved with it.

00:10:50.782 --> 00:10:52.144
It's rather rare.

00:10:54.908 --> 00:10:57.892
Well, you can't do that at the undergraduate level, right?

00:10:57.912 --> 00:11:02.018
But at the graduate level, you can start specializing.

00:11:02.038 --> 00:11:19.523
I introduced a lot of petroleum engineering into my petroleum geology course so that my students had no trouble conversing with a petroleum engineer and knowing what the problems were, at least in production of petroleum.

00:11:19.975 --> 00:11:37.110
And that was the goal of mine, to try to integrate the geology, geophysics, with the petroleum engineering, which we finally ended up having big projects funded by DOE.

00:11:37.651 --> 00:11:39.993
That kind of presents that with petroleum engineering.

00:11:41.694 --> 00:11:42.835
Describe those projects.

00:11:43.436 --> 00:11:47.940
Did you know Steve Poston was a petroleum engineer?

00:11:48.967 --> 00:11:51.350
now retired.

00:11:52.853 --> 00:12:00.063
This one was called Low Production from a Low Firm in Jody Rock, having him around.

00:12:00.083 --> 00:12:08.855
The boom on Austin Shaw, which I said previously was really going in the 80s, early 80s.

00:12:08.876 --> 00:12:11.539
So we chopped up the study into several pieces.

00:12:11.840 --> 00:12:13.422
I had, of course, the rock.

00:12:13.908 --> 00:12:41.637
The these students were masters usually or and

00:12:44.300 --> 00:12:49.947
Did the, you mentioned the relationship with geophysics and petroleum engineering.

00:12:51.408 --> 00:12:56.995
During the years here, your years here, have those relationships always been friendly?

00:12:58.237 --> 00:13:00.199
Yes, I'd say so.

00:13:00.219 --> 00:13:03.423
With me personally, they have been.

00:13:03.443 --> 00:13:07.928
I'd no sooner been on the campus for a few days than I met Bob Weidner.

00:13:08.701 --> 00:13:34.557
Alright, would that be one of the primary lines of demarcation between petroleum engineering and geology?

00:13:37.541 --> 00:13:38.522
Rocks and liquid?

00:13:39.447 --> 00:13:41.290
All right, then what about geophysics?

00:13:42.191 --> 00:13:46.357
Okay.

00:13:46.377 --> 00:13:53.346
Oh, okay, okay.

00:13:54.548 --> 00:13:59.695
In these courses that you taught, normally about how many students per semester?

00:14:06.324 --> 00:14:08.948
In the boom years, I went as high as 65.

00:14:10.666 --> 00:14:11.688
Wow.

00:14:11.708 --> 00:14:14.151
All right, what about the down years?

00:14:18.458 --> 00:14:26.531
And where did these students get their undergraduate degrees usually?

00:14:28.113 --> 00:14:38.850
Well, not so much now, because I had less contact with students a few years ago.

00:14:39.455 --> 00:15:02.999
And when did you begin to get international students?

00:15:03.019 --> 00:15:07.183
Well, I think also in the 80s.

00:15:08.733 --> 00:15:10.295
From what parts of the world?

00:15:11.296 --> 00:15:11.416
China.

00:15:11.436 --> 00:15:11.796
China?

00:15:12.697 --> 00:15:14.719
They're all over the place.

00:15:14.739 --> 00:15:18.383
Were they here sent by the government, or did they come on their own?

00:15:22.166 --> 00:15:32.336
Those that were sent by the government got such a fitness to live on that they have to have some other kind of support.

00:15:32.356 --> 00:15:33.998
Either they had personal money or some small grants from the department and so on.

00:15:35.227 --> 00:15:39.251
Describe those Chinese students in terms of their ability and their motivation.

00:15:40.513 --> 00:15:43.536
Well, it ranged just like all of the students.

00:15:43.556 --> 00:15:44.597
Is that right?

00:15:44.677 --> 00:15:49.863
Yeah, I had one of my most recent ones.

00:15:49.883 --> 00:15:50.264
He was a Ph.D.

00:15:50.284 --> 00:15:51.365
He was 47 years old.

00:15:51.385 --> 00:15:55.349
And he died last year of a heart attack.

00:15:55.369 --> 00:15:57.892
But he was great.

00:15:57.912 --> 00:16:05.200
And he had heard about me and had gone to high school with a couple of other guys who had been here and got their degree.

00:16:05.669 --> 00:16:13.458
And so he was a dedicated student.

00:16:13.478 --> 00:16:15.761
He was Taiwan.

00:16:15.781 --> 00:16:31.359
And the Taiwan, the China Petroleum Corporation sent him back to study in London for a year.

00:16:31.379 --> 00:16:32.039
I mean, that's a well-known song.

00:16:32.059 --> 00:16:35.203
Anyway, they range.

00:16:36.922 --> 00:16:47.515
Did these Chinese students tend to all go back to Taiwan or to mainland China?

00:16:59.950 --> 00:17:06.017
Do you remember any anecdotes about how hardworking they were or how lost they might be or anything?

00:17:06.993 --> 00:17:34.384
How many doctoral students have you directed?

00:17:36.727 --> 00:17:42.035
How many total?

00:17:42.055 --> 00:17:42.316
111.

00:17:42.336 --> 00:17:42.516
111.

00:17:44.179 --> 00:17:58.681
And among those doctoral students, what would be your guesstimate now as to how many of those are in academia and how many of them in the real world of economic geology?

00:17:59.703 --> 00:18:01.946
They all went into economics.

00:18:01.966 --> 00:18:02.467
Okay.

00:18:02.487 --> 00:18:03.869
They may have taught for a while.

00:18:04.530 --> 00:18:04.911
But they...

00:18:07.996 --> 00:18:10.038
All right, now you served as department head how long?

00:18:11.419 --> 00:18:11.640
Five years.

00:18:11.660 --> 00:18:12.541
Five years, all right.

00:18:12.601 --> 00:18:16.785
Describe the department when you left the department head job.

00:18:17.786 --> 00:18:19.708
You've already talked about what it was when you got here.

00:18:19.768 --> 00:18:21.049
Describe it when you left it.

00:18:26.855 --> 00:18:33.462
Well, it was still a growing department, but carrying on good research, a lot of research.

00:18:33.482 --> 00:18:33.902
But I was very proud.

00:18:34.237 --> 00:18:37.286
About how many faculty when you left as department head?

00:18:37.507 --> 00:18:39.613
The head counted about 25.

00:18:39.633 --> 00:18:41.519
Okay.

00:18:41.539 --> 00:18:42.763
So it tripled?

00:18:46.394 --> 00:18:46.474
Yes.

00:18:47.146 --> 00:18:50.171
Oh, okay, okay.

00:18:50.191 --> 00:19:01.748
The College of Engineering, I mean, excuse me, the College of Geosciences, led by Earl Cook in the 70s.

00:19:03.451 --> 00:19:05.554
Let's go back to campus leadership.

00:19:06.936 --> 00:19:12.985
Mr. Rutter dies unexpectedly in 1970.

00:19:14.450 --> 00:19:20.037
And we have an interim president, and then Jack Williams becomes the president.

00:19:20.057 --> 00:19:26.765
Did you and the geology department, did those changes at the top make any difference to y'all?

00:19:30.729 --> 00:19:31.450
I don't think so.

00:19:31.470 --> 00:19:31.871
All right.

00:19:31.931 --> 00:19:34.674
And Dr. Byers was then the vice president of academic affairs.

00:19:37.037 --> 00:19:42.904
Can you think of anything special that Dr. Byers did for geology?

00:19:44.808 --> 00:19:49.515
But y'all certainly didn't suffer with him there.

00:19:51.038 --> 00:19:56.005
No, but we were not favored with any particular grants.

00:19:56.446 --> 00:20:00.513
It was a big push.

00:20:00.533 --> 00:20:01.474
Let me tell you one thing.

00:20:01.494 --> 00:20:07.203
We talked about enrollment a few minutes ago.

00:20:07.223 --> 00:20:12.992
In the outside course, in the beginning courses, we're teaching almost 1,300 students a semester.

00:20:14.828 --> 00:20:28.167
It just means that we have to load up with all these labs, laboratory assistants, and so on.

00:20:28.187 --> 00:20:28.668
But that's a great help.

00:20:28.688 --> 00:20:37.701
And I would assume that that would be, in general, a satisfying activity.

00:20:38.482 --> 00:20:44.110
Because those students, I presume, would be from all over the campus in their majors.

00:20:45.170 --> 00:20:51.416
When did women, when did co-eds begin to start taking geology courses in sizable numbers?

00:20:52.417 --> 00:21:05.889
Well, within a year after I came here, we had at least three women, I'd say, enrolled undergraduates.

00:21:05.909 --> 00:21:08.411
And the reason was Fred Smith.

00:21:08.431 --> 00:21:14.637
He went and got several NSF grants, science for secondary school students.

00:21:16.152 --> 00:21:20.718
And they came on the campus, what, three weeks?

00:21:20.738 --> 00:21:27.205
And you had field trips organized and all kinds of things.

00:21:27.225 --> 00:21:39.620
A large number, and they were all highly selected and kind of their, what do you call it, national honors.

00:21:39.640 --> 00:21:43.425
And many of those students came back and enrolled here.

00:21:44.401 --> 00:22:07.759
do you remember any pioneer female graduate students a doctoral student or anything was there do you remember a

00:22:13.966 --> 00:22:29.789
One girl, she was in the prostitutes, she came from Giddings.

00:22:30.069 --> 00:22:32.793
Her father was a mechanic, auto mechanic in Giddings, and he had nine children and a family.

00:22:32.813 --> 00:22:34.015
And, you know, I don't know how they put her, she was good.

00:22:34.235 --> 00:22:39.262
Long later comes her brother, she was a physicist.

00:22:39.282 --> 00:22:39.923
Both of them had done very well.

00:22:44.628 --> 00:22:54.703
When I was an undergraduate at Austin College, we did our geology field lab up in the Arbuckle Mountains in Oklahoma.

00:22:55.985 --> 00:23:02.955
Then at Missouri, I learned that they have a big field lab in the summer near Lander, Wyoming.

00:23:03.776 --> 00:23:09.204
Where does A&M geology students, where do they do any field work?

00:23:10.706 --> 00:23:12.629
They have a floating field camp.

00:23:12.649 --> 00:23:13.791
They start out saying...

00:23:15.205 --> 00:23:40.386
And they used to then end up

00:23:40.737 --> 00:23:58.363
along what's called the Book Cliffs in Utah, Colorado, and maybe even up at Fort Astor, Marble Convent, so that they get a variety of field experience.

00:23:58.383 --> 00:23:59.505
Back to the...

00:24:00.076 --> 00:24:29.290
back to the seventies dr buyers retires and john calhoun becomes the vice president for academic affairs as a world-class petroleum engineer i presume that you all didn't suffer at all from uh... his feeling uh... but geology was important

00:24:30.012 --> 00:24:33.337
But you also didn't, there wasn't any loss of anything, was there?

00:24:34.559 --> 00:24:34.619
No.

00:24:34.639 --> 00:24:45.455
Calhoun became dean of geosciences for about a year.

00:24:45.475 --> 00:24:45.696
Yeah, yeah.

00:24:45.716 --> 00:24:47.779
Did you ever work with him, with Calhoun?

00:24:48.279 --> 00:24:52.366
Describe Calhoun's personality and work style.

00:24:55.010 --> 00:24:57.994
He was always nervous, right?

00:25:01.720 --> 00:25:10.011
You know, I've written, if you've read some of what I've written, I like the NERI, NERI's description.

00:25:10.031 --> 00:25:15.698
John was a genius at building, and he could visualize what would happen.

00:25:15.979 --> 00:25:22.907
He started an academic program, and he said, oh yeah, we could do a research program, or vice versa.

00:25:22.928 --> 00:25:30.377
And of course, every one of those ideas, somebody had to look into them and see if it worked well, and so it was NERI who made it.

00:25:30.397 --> 00:25:31.018
And then...

00:25:31.387 --> 00:25:54.728
I think I may have been in the room when that was said at least once.

00:25:55.147 --> 00:25:59.472
Nate you became director of research when do you remember?

00:25:59.492 --> 00:26:11.787
70 so you and I then joined his staff at about the same time And did you continue teaching doing any research during it?

00:26:11.807 --> 00:26:20.057
That's what I thought Now during that

00:26:20.678 --> 00:26:30.833
As you look back on the 70s, the early 70s, Williams and Calhoun, what do you think about the university's progress during that time?

00:26:37.964 --> 00:26:39.826
I don't know.

00:26:39.846 --> 00:26:40.948
Research was increasing, so everything was going great.

00:26:41.941 --> 00:27:00.473
See, I believe that Rutter laid the foundation and Williams built on it and that nobody but Rutter could have done what he did because he wasn't vulnerable to political difficulties.

00:27:01.583 --> 00:27:08.191
but that he could not have built academically what Williams did and vice versa.

00:27:09.292 --> 00:27:13.798
And that Williams and Calhoun worked well together.

00:27:15.380 --> 00:27:21.988
And I may be biased here, but I think that they put together a pretty good team there.

00:27:23.453 --> 00:27:25.175
All right, then Dr. Williams dies.

00:27:25.476 --> 00:27:26.838
Calhoun resigns.

00:27:28.079 --> 00:27:29.581
Dr. Miller becomes president.

00:27:30.142 --> 00:27:34.027
How long did you stay in the...

00:27:36.651 --> 00:27:37.051
I did to 83.

00:27:37.071 --> 00:27:37.392
To 83.

00:27:37.412 --> 00:27:39.555
That's when I got the chair.

00:27:39.575 --> 00:27:45.122
Now, how did things change in terms of your task?

00:27:45.142 --> 00:27:48.927
Did they change under Dr. Miller or following him?

00:27:52.111 --> 00:27:52.172
No.

00:27:52.192 --> 00:27:52.532
I had a little...

00:27:53.592 --> 00:28:11.330
Let's see, you mentioned the Winerdi saying to Calhoun, it's like juggling plates in the air.

00:28:12.452 --> 00:28:18.077
Do you remember any other incidents or examples of those years?

00:28:20.640 --> 00:28:21.201
Oh, yeah, I remember a lot.

00:28:21.221 --> 00:28:22.502
Well, share some of them.

00:28:24.355 --> 00:28:32.825
This is Richard E. Winerdi, W-A-I-N-E-R-D-I.

00:28:35.027 --> 00:28:48.422
He was going to be on leave attached to the National Science Foundation.

00:28:48.875 --> 00:28:55.385
We had to have a contract and so on.

00:28:55.405 --> 00:29:04.640
And when Ernie came rushing into my office one day, he threw down this stuff around my desk and said, we've got to have a contract done.

00:29:04.660 --> 00:29:09.527
And I said, well, it's being signed by NSF and I can't do anything until they sign it.

00:29:09.547 --> 00:29:13.714
He said, yeah, but we don't know right now what to do.

00:29:13.734 --> 00:29:16.418
So I thought, who do I know at NSF?

00:29:17.478 --> 00:29:20.583
He was there attached to oceanography.

00:29:20.603 --> 00:29:25.029
So I called Vian and I said, I want to know about this contract.

00:29:25.049 --> 00:29:27.333
He said, I just saw it this morning.

00:29:27.353 --> 00:29:29.055
It got signed.

00:29:29.075 --> 00:29:29.576
It went past.

00:29:31.879 --> 00:29:34.343
I said, okay, can you get a copy of that for me?

00:29:35.024 --> 00:29:38.088
And he said, yeah, he's in oceanography.

00:29:38.108 --> 00:29:38.809
He said, they had a fax machine.

00:29:38.950 --> 00:29:40.532
Now, not very many people have fax machines.

00:29:42.115 --> 00:29:49.705
So when Ernie had come into my office about 11.30 that morning, by 1.30 I had a copy of the contract.

00:29:50.426 --> 00:30:01.861
And I waited until he got back from lunch, and I soldered into his office and threw this paper on the desk and said, here's a copy of that contract.

00:30:01.881 --> 00:30:05.566
He saw that it had been signed that day in Washington.

00:30:05.586 --> 00:30:06.267
So...

00:30:06.533 --> 00:30:07.716
He said, how'd you do this?

00:30:08.517 --> 00:30:11.323
I said, I'm not going to tell you.

00:30:11.343 --> 00:30:12.586
And that's about it.

00:30:12.706 --> 00:30:13.568
He figured it out.

00:30:13.588 --> 00:30:18.839
I think they never mentioned him.

00:30:19.380 --> 00:30:21.184
I had a lot of fun.

00:30:22.143 --> 00:30:35.747
To me, one of the thrills of those years was that I think without saying so to anyone, we felt we were part of an organization that was moving.

00:30:37.049 --> 00:30:37.791
There was motion.

00:30:38.933 --> 00:30:40.776
There was progress.

00:30:40.756 --> 00:30:49.533
Now, you reported to Calhoun, but you looked at research all across the campus.

00:30:49.553 --> 00:30:51.577
I'm not going to ask the negative.

00:30:52.058 --> 00:30:55.866
With which parts of the campus was it easiest to work?

00:30:56.487 --> 00:30:57.168
Which units?

00:30:58.892 --> 00:31:00.655
Who were the most...

00:31:02.288 --> 00:31:06.013
He really should.

00:31:07.014 --> 00:31:09.818
You asked that question negatively.

00:31:09.838 --> 00:31:11.019
You were the hardest he had gone with.

00:31:12.101 --> 00:31:13.943
Well, no, I was asking the positive.

00:31:16.226 --> 00:31:18.209
Well, let's start on some of them.

00:31:18.229 --> 00:31:20.231
Harry Kunkel, he was a great guy.

00:31:21.353 --> 00:31:22.354
I don't know.

00:31:22.514 --> 00:31:29.103
He had a lot of control over there, but he still was very cooperative.

00:31:29.123 --> 00:31:29.743
He would do anything he wanted.

00:31:29.763 --> 00:31:31.806
He would help the system.

00:31:32.731 --> 00:31:40.824
Fred Benson, of course, was at odds with Galloway all the time.

00:31:40.844 --> 00:31:41.065
Everything.

00:31:41.085 --> 00:31:41.848
I don't think they agreed on anything.

00:31:41.868 --> 00:31:43.635
So it was a little bit different for Fred.
