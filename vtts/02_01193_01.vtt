WEBVTT

00:03.254 --> 00:07.900
and how you can be associated

00:03.254 --> 00:07.900
with them. OK.

00:10.464 --> 00:14.450
Ready? Yeah, I'm ready. I don't have to do that. 
Excuse me. Well, my name is Paul W. Womack. And I was

00:20.218 --> 00:32.755
born in Texarkana up in Bowie County in Northeast 
Texas, December 12, 1921, and lived there until I

00:20.218 --> 00:32.755
went into the Army during World War II. in 1942. I

00:34.091 --> 00:47.343
graduated from Texas Senior High School in 
Texarkana from Texarkana College, which was a

00:34.091 --> 00:47.343
junior college. And for two years immediately 
preceding my entry into the United States Army in

00:47.363 --> 01:02.877
World War II, I worked at the Federal Correctional 
Institution in Texarkana, where I was secretary

00:47.363 --> 01:02.877
to the Classification Committee responsible for 
history on

01:03.245 --> 01:30.214
responsible for recording the minutes of a 
committee that interviewed inmates coming in and

01:03.245 --> 01:30.214
got their life history and their health situation 
and the needs economic needs of their family at

01:03.245 --> 01:30.214
home so the so the prison could properly assign 
them to work duties and give them the opportunity

01:31.038 --> 01:36.423
for educational and health facilities there at 
the prison. I went into the Army in August of 1942,

01:36.443 --> 01:48.735
was overseas in October 1942, and spent three 
years in North Africa, Italy, and France, and

01:36.443 --> 01:48.735
returned. I was with the Services Supply Army of 
the United States. Primarily, I was a part of the

01:54.041 --> 01:59.526
various port headquarters at Casablanca. Oh. 
O-Ran, Naples, and Marseilles. And we were in what

02:03.340 --> 02:06.143
was called the Transportation Corps. Yeah. 
Responsible for operating the port and, of

02:06.824 --> 02:14.632
course, receiving incoming cargo and personnel 
and seeing that it probably stored and then sent on

02:06.824 --> 02:14.632
to the front. Were you an officer in this or an 
enlisted? I went into the Army as a private in, uh,

02:16.093 --> 02:28.045
and while I was at Camp Robinson, which was a 
reception center at Little Rock, Arkansas, I was

02:16.093 --> 02:28.045
promoted to corporal first week because because 
the brass found out that I knew how to type and take

02:28.666 --> 02:34.797
shorthand, which I learned in high school. And 
they were extremely short of GIs with those

02:34.817 --> 02:46.939
capabilities, and they were preparing the forces 
at that time for the invasion of Europe, even at

02:34.817 --> 02:46.939
that point. So I was promoted to corporal and then 
sent to... Indian Town Gap, Pennsylvania, and

02:52.713 --> 03:02.225
from there to Staten Island, New York, and 
overseas to Casablanca within about two months

02:52.713 --> 03:02.225
after I joined the Army. So you didn't go through a 
regular basic training? No. I was promoted to, I

03:05.610 --> 03:21.150
got various promotions and was promoted to 
warrant officer junior grade while still in North

03:05.610 --> 03:21.150
Africa, and then while I was in Italy, I received a 
field commission as second lieutenant after

03:05.610 --> 03:21.150
being thoroughly trained questioned by a board of 
about 16 chicken colonels. And I had that rank when

03:26.201 --> 03:30.567
I was discharged in 1945.

03:33.451 --> 03:39.980
So as soon as I came back from the Army, I enrolled at 
Rice University to complete my undergraduate

03:33.451 --> 03:39.980
degree. And after graduating from Rice with a 
liberal arts, bachelor of arts degree, I enrolled

03:41.081 --> 03:51.255
at South Texas College of Law, which is a night law 
school in Houston. and graduated from there in

03:51.353 --> 03:57.739
1950 with a Dr. George Prudence degree. How I first 
came to know George Mitchell, some of this is going

03:59.301 --> 04:12.214
to be excess verbiage about me, and I don't want to 
take anything from the Woodlands, and you can cut

03:59.301 --> 04:12.214
all this out, but I do whatever you want. I'd rather 
have more than that. Yeah, I want you to understand

04:13.756 --> 04:16.078
how. When I came to Houston in early 46 to enroll at 
Rice, I was planning to be married, and I needed a

04:16.733 --> 04:31.907
part-time job, because GI benefits were rather 
limited at that time. I did go to school on GI, Bill,

04:33.088 --> 04:38.994
though, both at Rice University and South Texas 
College of Law. This was in 46, you said? Yeah.

04:40.695 --> 04:41.156
Early 46? Early 46. You must have been one of the 
first ones separated out of it. Yeah, well, see,

04:44.088 --> 04:59.292
the war ended in 45, and I arrived back home in, oh, I 
guess, November, October or November, went back

04:44.088 --> 04:59.292
to work for a brief period at the federal prison in 
Texas County. Yeah, you would have had a lot of

04:59.412 --> 05:00.954
points then. Oh, yeah, I did. Oh, yeah, having been 
overseas for three years, I was one of the first to

05:01.695 --> 05:07.224
come back after the war in the Pacific ended. And I 
needed to work, so I had a... A friend I grew up with

05:12.961 --> 05:30.563
in Texas County who had married a young man who was 
down here in Houston and whom I did not know, but who

05:12.961 --> 05:30.563
was a student at South Texas College of Law and 
worked as a secretary in a small law firm in

05:12.961 --> 05:30.563
downtown Houston. He didn't want to work but a half 
a day because he wanted his afternoons free to

05:30.583 --> 05:37.111
study for the night classes. So through this 
acquaintance in Texas County to whom he had been

05:38.333 --> 05:42.698
married, went down and got on as a part-time 
secretary to the law firm in downtown Houston and

05:42.931 --> 05:59.491
worked there in the afternoons and later on 
full-time all the way through Rice University and

05:42.931 --> 05:59.491
South Texas College of Law. In that law firm was 
Paul Smith, an attorney, now retired, who had

05:59.511 --> 06:06.820
known George and Johnny Mitchell. They grew up 
together in Galveston. They were all BOIs. I know

06:11.386 --> 06:15.534
you're familiar with that phrase. So at that time, 
George and Johnny and Merlin and a fellow by the

06:15.554 --> 06:32.125
name of Roxy Wright were just beginning, that's 
early 46, were just beginning to get into the oil

06:15.554 --> 06:32.125
business with offices over in the Esperson 
building in downtown Houston. So I was secretary

06:33.826 --> 06:37.851
to Paul Smith and the other lawyers in the firm. 
They were free, I guess, at that time. And Paul was

06:41.034 --> 06:49.544
doing George and Johnny's oil and gas work at the 
very beginning when they got into the oil

06:41.034 --> 06:49.544
business. So that's when I met George Mitchell and 
Johnny in early 1946. But when I graduated from law

06:57.073 --> 07:03.681
school, I had made commitments to go with the same 
young man who had graduated from law school and

07:04.336 --> 07:10.624
entered the title business in Houston, so I went 
into practice with him. I didn't become

07:11.365 --> 07:32.554
associated again with Paul Smith of the firm of 
Smith and Fulton, who were attorneys all through

07:11.365 --> 07:32.554
the formative stages of the Mitchell Company and 
on until Paul retired and Tom Fulton passed away

07:11.365 --> 07:32.554
about two or three years ago.

07:33.108 --> 07:36.311
Let me see, I've lost my train of thought.

07:39.574 --> 08:01.933
I became associated with Paul Smith and Tom Fulton 
in early 1964, at the very time that George was in

07:39.574 --> 08:01.933
the process of completing the acquisition of the 
Old Grove and Copper and Lumber Company, which

07:39.574 --> 08:01.933
owned several thousand acres of land in 
Montgomery and the joining counties. Most of my

08:03.010 --> 08:18.554
work during that period when I was not associated 
with Paul or the Mitchell Companies in any way was

08:03.010 --> 08:18.554
in the real estate field as attorney for a title 
company and doing real estate conveyancing and

08:03.010 --> 08:18.554
primarily that's what I was doing in private 
practice. Was that more or less your specialty?

08:19.616 --> 08:22.680
Yes, that was my specialty, real estate. So it just 
fell into place there for about three or four years

08:22.701 --> 08:29.130
as they began to get into the real estate business. 
They had been, of course, only in the oil and gas and

08:32.525 --> 08:36.650
related businesses up to that time in 64. And it 
just fell in line that I was doing some of the

08:38.333 --> 08:48.285
Mitchell work while I was associated with Smith 
and Fulton, not as a partner, but just an

08:38.333 --> 08:48.285
associate. And so the company offered me the 
position of vice president and counsel on

08:49.167 --> 08:55.715
effective January 1, 1968. And that's when I 
became an employee of the Mitchell Company's And

09:02.326 --> 09:07.451
at that time began the creation of the legal 
department. Mitchell never had an internal legal

09:07.651 --> 09:10.714
department. As such, they had this small firm of 
Smith and Fulton, which served as a sort of

09:10.854 --> 09:19.021
in-house law department. But they were not 
integrated as a part of the company. And that was

09:26.528 --> 09:31.573
the beginning, and I worked with, Mr. Charles 
Lively, who was employed by the company and who was

09:32.600 --> 09:45.392
the outside contact between the company and 
various property owners in the Woodlands area.

09:46.653 --> 09:52.599
And at that time, I was the legal department for a 
couple years or so at Mitchell. I had one

09:52.619 --> 09:53.680
secretary. And Mr. Mitchell, of course, would 
make the decisions as to what properties he wanted

09:54.801 --> 10:01.307
to acquire in connection with blocking up this 
land out here for the Woodlands development, and

10:01.895 --> 10:13.627
Charles would make the contact with the owners and 
bring back the information, and I would write the

10:01.895 --> 10:13.627
contracts. We probably,

10:13.647 --> 10:27.902
I guess we must have had 300 or more separate 
transactions all the way down from a half acre up to

10:13.647 --> 10:27.902
several thousand acres of land involved in the 
various transactions that were entered into in

10:28.658 --> 10:31.963
order to block up the land, the woodlands. Were 
there any special legal challenges associated

10:32.704 --> 10:38.072
with that? Well, there were a number of special 
challenges, and later on, David Bumgardner,

10:38.092 --> 10:57.822
who's now Associate General Counsel and heads the 
Real Estate Department, or Division of the Legal

10:38.092 --> 10:57.822
Department, Dave came to work for me in the legal 
department, and he became involved with me in a

10:38.092 --> 10:57.822
number of challenging transactions, one of which 
was an exchange of land with Champion. Lumber

11:05.443 --> 11:06.385
company? Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, Champion. And 
they had a they had a subsidiary called Champion

11:08.588 --> 11:22.510
Realty, I believe, and very complicated process 
of working out an exchange of some land that they

11:08.588 --> 11:22.510
had for some land we wanted in the closer proximity 
to the core of the woodlands. And that turned out to

11:23.333 --> 11:27.958
be quite a challenging situation. And then Mr. 
Mitchell decided

11:28.018 --> 11:39.091
that he would like to get into the land title 
insurance business. So it was Dave and my

11:39.892 --> 11:52.767
responsibility to get all the title work done for 
the several thousand acres that then comprised

11:39.892 --> 11:52.767
the woodlands. and get it ready not only for the 
entrance into the title business, which we did

11:53.168 --> 12:09.327
before we had sold the bonds to start the 
Woodlands, but also to have a title insurance

11:53.168 --> 12:09.327
agency that we were part owners of that would be 
writing the title insurance here in the

11:53.168 --> 12:09.327
Woodlands. Do you know what prompted Mr. 
Mitchell's decision to get into the title

12:09.608 --> 12:14.413
business? Well, Leonard Ivins at that time, who 
came down from Baltimore, Maryland, uh was head of

12:22.109 --> 12:47.779
the woodlands and he i think lynn more than george 
wanted to capture as much of the business that was

12:22.109 --> 12:47.779
created by the woodlands development that he 
could and including that he knew was quite a bit of

12:22.109 --> 12:47.779
title business and he thought was uh probably very 
lucrative so i think it was lynn ivan's more so than

12:22.109 --> 12:47.779
george himself but george readily agreed to it and 
One thing that happened, we started out with one

12:48.586 --> 12:56.715
company and

12:48.586 --> 12:56.715
were pressed for time. This was in early 72. And, of 
course, George had another friend on at

12:59.519 --> 13:16.078
Galveston,

12:59.519 --> 13:16.078
Carlos Morris, who was president, chairman of 
Stewart Title Guarantee Company, which is the

12:59.519 --> 13:16.078
granddaddy of Title Insurance in the state of 
Texas. So almost at the 11th hour, Carlos Marsh

13:16.683 --> 13:25.712
talked George into going to the Stewart Title 
Guarantee Company in the development of the title

13:16.683 --> 13:25.712
business in the Woodlands. So we had to switch 
gears. And of course, we had worked with Stewart in

13:29.676 --> 13:40.667
other areas, like especially down at Galveston in 
the Pirates Cove and Pirates Beach subdivisions

13:29.676 --> 13:40.667
down there. And we knew all those people. But we 
switched gears and got the company started, which

13:42.509 --> 13:46.133
is now stir a title of Montgomery County, Inc. here 
in the Woodlands. And that proved to be quite a

13:50.583 --> 13:53.808
challenge. And getting the titles of all of the 
land involved in the Woodlands ready to be in an

13:53.828 --> 14:03.801
insurable status so that the bonds could be 
issued. And what we had to do was, pardon me, just

14:04.922 --> 14:10.069
for me, sir. What did I say, Donovan? You were in the 
process of getting all the titles together for the

14:11.527 --> 14:17.593
bonding? Oh, yeah, because the bonds were 
guaranteed by the United States government. And

14:22.398 --> 14:28.204
to secure that guarantee, we had to give the 
government a deed of trust on all of the land out

14:22.398 --> 14:28.204
here. And necessarily all of the parcels had to be 
examined and surveys made and exceptions noted,

14:28.224 --> 14:36.893
reservations, and all of that. in order for 
stirred title guarantee company to issue the $50

14:37.177 --> 14:49.237
million policy guaranteeing, ensuring that the 
titles were good and that the that the lean was

14:37.177 --> 14:49.237
good. So we had to do this under a pressure 
situation. In fact, Dave and I worked in New York

14:53.644 --> 15:00.535
for two days with a total of about six hours sleep, 
three hours each night getting that ready. And we

15:00.555 --> 15:02.138
in order to to have it ready before the bonds were 
sold in late summer, early fall of 1972. That

15:07.659 --> 15:13.165
proved to be quite a challenging operation, too. 
Can you imagine how many pieces of land were

15:13.225 --> 15:22.955
involved in the 25,000 acres out here at the 
Woodlands and all the mineral exceptions,

15:13.225 --> 15:22.955
easements, and everything else? And there were a 
number of titles which had to be cleared up. Most of

15:27.683 --> 15:34.974
which, though, were just a simple matter, not too 
many complicated title requirements that had to

15:27.683 --> 15:34.974
be curated. To make a long story short, we did get 
the information ready so that the policy could be

15:34.994 --> 15:44.069
issued in time for the sale of the $50 million in 
bonds. And that was a negotiated sale, and time was

15:44.089 --> 15:49.798
a big factor there, too. Because I think, if I'm not 
wrong, this was the last negotiated bond sale that

15:53.553 --> 16:17.333
they had from then on they decided to go out to bid 
process and we got a as a result of that we got a very

15:53.553 --> 16:17.333
favorable 7.1 interest rate and then uh later on uh 
mr mitchell wanted to sell uh some of the timber on

15:53.553 --> 16:17.333
the various tracks of land some of the pine timber 
in georgia pacific was then active in this area.

16:20.181 --> 16:26.594
Later on, Louisiana's Pacific was spun off of 
Georgia Pacific because of antitrust problems

16:20.181 --> 16:26.594
with the government. But we had to prepare the 
initial contract under which 100 million board

16:26.614 --> 16:33.950
feet of pine timber was sold. And I'd never drawn a 
timber contract in my life up to that point. And

16:39.132 --> 16:51.524
that was a very challenging situation by virtue of 
the fact that I had studied typing and shorthand in

16:39.132 --> 16:51.524
high school and worked with it all through the 
Army, my Army experience. And while I was working

16:51.624 --> 16:56.990
in prison in Tuxcana, I became a pretty good 
typist. And I would work on the contract at night at

16:57.050 --> 17:06.439
home and bring it back, and we'd review it during 
the day with all the representatives of Georgia

16:57.050 --> 17:06.439
Pacific and and our people that furnished, of 
course, the technical information necessary to

17:06.858 --> 17:13.126
prepare the agreement. And we got that worked out, 
which is, you know, even to this day is used as the

17:13.146 --> 17:21.057
landmark contract for dealings with Louisiana 
Pacific. And then another challenging

17:23.000 --> 17:32.072
opportunity for me came when the attorney that 
Lynn Ivins had employed up in Baltimore that he had

17:32.744 --> 17:58.870
known at the Roush development up there to to work 
out the terms of a contract with Gulf States

17:32.744 --> 17:58.870
Utility Company to provide electric power to the 
woodlands and also to to pay a sort of not really a

17:32.744 --> 17:58.870
license fee because we were not a city and not in a 
position to give a license was very comparable to a

17:59.356 --> 18:04.504
fee that they would pay the city of Houston, for 
instance, like Houston Lighting Power, for a

17:59.356 --> 18:04.504
license to operate. Now, who are they? This was in 
Gulf State, isn't it? Gulf State Utility Company,

18:07.348 --> 18:08.510
yes. And they still, of course, they're the only 
utility company serving the woodlands. And along

18:13.838 --> 18:18.765
the way, Lynn became disenchanted with this 
lawyer up there, and he was charging what he

18:19.150 --> 18:26.999
considered an excessive fee, so he asked me to pick 
up the ball and continue with that, which we did. We

18:27.080 --> 18:45.402
finally reached an agreement with Gulf States 
Utilities Company, and it's, of course, still the

18:27.080 --> 18:45.402
contract under which Gulf States provides 
electric power and pays a royalty or fee to the

18:27.080 --> 18:45.402
woodlands, which is used to help pay community, 
cost of community amenities. Could you also get

18:45.842 --> 18:47.284
involved in... the other utilities? No. Dave 
worked out, Dave Baumgartner worked out, did most

18:51.289 --> 19:05.383
of the work on the agreement with, I believe, to set 
up a gas company here in the Woodlands, which was

18:51.289 --> 19:05.383
later sold to Intex early on. We had to do it 
initially because we had to have gas to provide the

19:05.403 --> 19:15.132
customers, you know, the residents out here, and 
we set up our own gas company, which was later. I did

19:15.193 --> 19:16.714
some work on that, but It was later sold to Intex, 
and I think John Watson, who's in governmental

19:17.116 --> 19:26.065
affairs, he's probably one of the people on your 
list. He worked on the negotiations with Intex,

19:26.745 --> 19:42.861
and Dave and I did the legal work to sell that gas 
company to Intex.

19:42.941 --> 19:44.263
Why did they sell it? That seems, well, it's a 
different, It's a related kind of industry. Well,

19:48.307 --> 20:01.082
it's related, but that was the only entry into the 
retail utility business that the company had

19:48.307 --> 20:01.082
until they got into the cable television business 
later on. And for some reason or other, Mr.

20:02.063 --> 20:09.892
Mitchell just didn't want to continue that 
particular business and made the deal with Intex.

20:11.895 --> 20:14.798
Of course, they're now the provider of natural 
gas. here in the woodlands what about the water

20:15.689 --> 20:38.946
water of course is provided by a series of 
municipal utility districts created and there

20:15.689 --> 20:38.946
again dave bungardner did most of the legal work on 
assisting with creation and a lawyer here who's on

20:15.689 --> 20:38.946
the outside of the county mike page represented 
the the district's uh as they were created and the

20:39.449 --> 20:51.062
necessary legal work with the state to get them 
created and get the bond issue authorized and

20:39.449 --> 20:51.062
sold. Each MUD has its own bond? Yes, each MUD has 
its own bond. Each MUD has its own officers and

20:55.507 --> 21:05.659
trustees, and they serve a certain designated 
area just like a school district would. and they

21:06.128 --> 21:33.992
they use common facilities a lot out here common 
sewer treatment plants through contract and that

21:06.128 --> 21:33.992
type of thing but they're all individually 
created districts with taxing authority and and

21:06.128 --> 21:33.992
the responsibility of providing water sewer and 
drainage to the area within their respective

21:06.128 --> 21:33.992
boundaries

21:06.128 --> 21:33.992
and the telephone situation proved to be a kind of a 
sticky situation we had again i think mr ivan's was

21:34.563 --> 22:01.701
probably more the moving factor in the creation of 
the telephone business than was george but of

21:34.563 --> 22:01.701
course george went along with it and we we formed a 
company in partnership with a with a company up in

21:34.563 --> 22:01.701
kylene i think it's called central telephone or 
something like that and uh we were going to own and

21:34.563 --> 22:01.701
and the telephone local telephone company here in 
the woodlands well we got We got into a situation

22:02.086 --> 22:11.240
where Southwestern Bell refused to give the 
company tie-ins for long-distance service. When

22:11.300 --> 22:13.463
was this? Oh, the very early days of development. 
In the early 70s? Yeah, yeah. And what we would have

22:18.110 --> 22:29.427
had, had we continued that, would have been just a 
giant intercommunication system here in the

22:18.110 --> 22:29.427
woodlands with no interconnects with 
long-distance. So the company hired some lawyers

22:30.267 --> 22:34.192
in Houston. Louis Payne primarily did the trial 
work and sued the Southwestern Belt Telephone

22:34.232 --> 22:59.903
Company under the antitrust laws for refusing to 
give interconnects and making it impossible,

22:34.232 --> 22:59.903
really, for the company which we had formed to 
install and operate a telephone system here in the

22:34.232 --> 22:59.903
woods. It was a 50-50 deal. We brought to the table, 
of course, the Woodlands and the business, and the

23:01.740 --> 23:12.032
other company brought to the table the expertise 
and know-how in operation of a telephone company.

23:12.052 --> 23:21.423
But we tried that case in the federal court in 
Houston, and we got a judgment from the jury for

23:12.052 --> 23:21.423
everything we asked for. This was, again, about 
the 70s? Yeah, it was in the early 70s. It must have

23:26.068 --> 23:29.552
been, well, I'm sure it was after we had opened in 
74, probably middle or later latter 70s that this

23:30.072 --> 23:35.640
occurred. And we filed suit. And like I said, we got 
a judgment. The jury rounded it off and lopped off

23:41.930 --> 23:46.917
$0.60 of the amount we we sued for. But other than 
that, they gave us everything we sued for. And

23:51.872 --> 23:54.797
under federal law, antitrust judgments are 
tripled. Whatever you get from the jury is

23:54.817 --> 23:56.599
tripled. So the judgment was $54 million in excess 
of $54 million. Well, naturally, the telephone,

24:01.486 --> 24:04.511
Southwestern Bell, appealed it. And the case was 
overturned by the Fifth Circuit in New Orleans in a

24:04.531 --> 24:09.117
ridiculous opinion. But nevertheless, they did 
overturn it. And after that, we settled with

24:12.302 --> 24:16.448
Southwestern Bell. They came into the woodlands, 
and that's why we have Southwestern Bell's AT&T

24:16.917 --> 24:25.875
system now instead of our own woodlands 
telecommunications system. Part of the

24:25.895 --> 24:33.090
settlement was cash, and part of the settlement 
was they purchased some land here in the

24:25.895 --> 24:33.090
woodlands. And we got a fairly nice settlement, 
but nothing like the the judgment of $54 million.

24:38.726 --> 24:42.090
So this other communications telephone company 
by the wayside. Doesn't exist. Doesn't exist.

24:44.333 --> 24:46.175
Although that used to be a norm in Texas. Yes. 
People did that. In fact, there's two of them in

24:47.176 --> 24:49.279
Lubbock or something like that. Well, I think 
there's one over here at Kingwood, too. And for

24:51.802 --> 24:58.891
some reason or other, they were able to get the 
necessary interconnects, but we couldn't. They

25:00.013 --> 25:03.597
just flat wouldn't work with us at all. I guess they 
saw the potential for business here in the

25:03.863 --> 25:10.231
Woodlands and wanted it, of course, for 
themselves. That's interesting. Tell me, you

25:12.975 --> 25:16.840
mentioned earlier about a cable company that Mr. 
Mitchell put together. I'd never heard about

25:16.880 --> 25:17.761
that. Well, we started the Woodlands Cablevision 
Company and operated it for a number of years. And I

25:24.198 --> 25:38.385
believe the company, the sale of 50% of it occurred 
after I retired, but I think it's still, in fact,

25:24.198 --> 25:38.385
I'm sure the company still owns 50%, but it's 
managed by the company that bought the other 50%

25:24.198 --> 25:38.385
interest in it. But for many years, we operated, 
owned and operated 100% of all the cable

25:38.425 --> 25:46.560
television services here in the Woodlands. Was 
this, I mean, obviously the intent was to make

25:46.861 --> 25:51.929
money, but also was it a quality of life issue? 
Well, yes, yes. I noticed Mr. Mitchell seemed

25:52.851 --> 26:11.822
very, very savvy about... Yeah, he wanted not only 
the services that cable companies can provide,

25:52.851 --> 26:11.822
but also the availability of local channels for 
local programming and things that would benefit

25:52.851 --> 26:11.822
the people living in the woodlands. educational 
services and things of that nature because he's

26:12.460 --> 26:40.240
been an ardent supporter of kuh tv oh yes channel 
nine uh channel uh eight eight yeah yeah public

26:12.460 --> 26:40.240
television yeah okay yeah but that's a regular 
that's a regular commercial public not

26:12.460 --> 26:40.240
commercial but it's a regular public television 
station this is just the cable that serves the

26:12.460 --> 26:40.240
woodlands yeah right now called woodlands cable 
vision i forgot what we called it when when did that

26:12.460 --> 26:40.240
company Well, I would say that company was formed 
very early, Don. But of course, I could research

26:46.569 --> 26:51.090
these things and get the dates and everything. 
Mike Richmond, over in the Executive Vice

26:51.290 --> 26:57.620
President of Woodlands Corporation, could fill 
you in on more detail. Mike was more directly

26:57.660 --> 26:59.162
involved in that. We've talked with him, but none 
of this came out. It didn't? Well, we didn't know

27:02.908 --> 27:03.990
what to ask. Yeah.

27:07.315 --> 27:09.458
Well, he was more interested in the woodlands, per 
se. Yeah. But one of the things that has intrigued

27:09.859 --> 27:19.474
me is the... One of the things I find fascinating 
about the woodlands is the completeness of the

27:09.859 --> 27:19.474
vision, the... maybe those are poor terms, but the 
comprehensiveness, maybe, of the vision that Mr.

27:20.095 --> 27:32.012
Mitchell had, which seemed to cover every aspect 
of... That came, of course, from George Mitchell.

27:32.833 --> 27:36.858
Mike was one of the people we got from the Roush 
folks out at Baltimore. And another man that we had

27:38.020 --> 27:47.233
here who passed away about two years ago, Byrne 
Robbins, was responsible for a lot of the early

27:38.020 --> 27:47.233
development of the woodlands. and we had some 
other other fellows here but mike i believe is

27:48.226 --> 28:14.723
about the only one that remains from that group as 
an executive ordinance corporation you returned

27:48.226 --> 28:14.723
in 86 february of uh 87 february 1st 87. four years 
will be four years has come in february since uh

27:48.226 --> 28:14.723
that book was published six seven years ago what 
what changes have you seen in the woodlands and the

28:15.597 --> 28:17.980
directions it's going?

28:21.263 --> 28:34.157
Well, of course, there's been considerable 
increase in commercial activity in the

28:21.263 --> 28:34.157
woodlands, the development of the research 
forest. I was involved in the initial legal work

28:34.858 --> 28:42.586
done when HARC was created. In fact, I drew the 
original proposal between the company and Skip

28:45.128 --> 28:51.378
Porter, who's now president of Hark. Because 
George, when he wanted to keep things pretty much

28:51.919 --> 29:07.002
close to the chest, he would just call me into his 
office, and I'd bring my shorthand pad, and he

28:51.919 --> 29:07.002
would, if I hadn't been able to take shorthand, I 
wouldn't have been able to keep up with him. and

29:07.353 --> 29:19.434
he'd dictate the terms of the agreement, you know, 
and then I'd take it back and prepare the

29:07.353 --> 29:19.434
agreements, and I worked with him and with Skip 
Porter on that when Skip was at A&M, where he came

29:07.353 --> 29:19.434
from here. I haven't had much to do with Hark since 
then, but was very much involved in the early

29:20.876 --> 29:30.913
creation of it.

29:31.282 --> 29:41.733
and the increase, of course, in the educational 
facilities here in the Woodlands, and building of

29:31.282 --> 29:41.733
new schools, and also in the church activity. I'm a 
member of the First Baptist Church here in the

29:41.773 --> 29:50.983
Woodlands, which was the first church created in 
the Woodlands, and since then there have been

29:41.773 --> 29:50.983
numerous churches, and some of them are getting 
quite large. The idea we had, or the idea Mr.

29:52.504 --> 30:00.613
Mitchell had initially, just didn't fly, but it 
was a very good idea, and his idea was that Instead

30:01.167 --> 30:27.242
of every denomination or congregation building a 
separate building, which they would use probably

30:01.167 --> 30:27.242
just a fraction of the time each week and on 
weekends, his idea was to have a common facility

30:01.167 --> 30:27.242
that would be used by numerous different 
denominations and therefore really save a lot of

30:01.167 --> 30:27.242
money in building independent churches. The idea 
just never seemed to catch on. So we have churches

30:30.042 --> 30:35.529
of just about every denomination, I believe, here 
in the Woodlands now. And of course, that's been

30:36.290 --> 30:44.340
progressing ever since the Woodlands was formed, 
not necessarily in the last three or four years. I

30:45.061 --> 30:47.504
still do some work for Mr. Mitchell. And of course, 
I still keep up with what's going on here, even

30:47.524 --> 30:53.351
though I don't do legal work for the company. But I 
think that in the near future, We're going to see

30:57.327 --> 31:14.447
continued development in the research forest 
area, and that's where I think the Woodlands

30:57.327 --> 31:14.447
probably will make the greatest input in the 
business and industrial and governmental and

30:57.327 --> 31:14.447
educational combination. Well, the regional 
mall. Yes, and the regional mall will come. And the

31:18.611 --> 31:24.398
mall, not the mall, but the other shopping center 
above the mall, between the mall and the hospital,

31:24.952 --> 31:34.964
I think the Target store is scheduled to open in the 
fall of this year, so that will be good for that area

31:24.952 --> 31:34.964
up there. And numerous new parks are being 
created, which is good. I think we'll have

31:40.692 --> 31:44.837
excellent golf courses and public parks. It's 
still a unique development insofar as everything

31:46.999 --> 31:53.187
that it offers its residents. not the least of 
which is security, and which is very important

31:53.538 --> 31:58.886
nowadays. Did you get involved, I can't remember 
who it was now, someone mentioned that a few years

31:59.567 --> 32:16.491
ago, or actually when Mr. Mitchell was trying to 
get this started, there was some resistance from

31:59.567 --> 32:16.491
the part of the,

31:59.567 --> 32:16.491
well, the county commissioners. Montgomery 
County was, you know, kind of... Well, yes, I was

32:17.737 --> 32:22.262
aware of that. And also, of course, I was involved 
in working with the outside law firm that we

32:22.302 --> 32:36.039
employed to work with the city of Houston in 
extending its territorial jurisdiction to

32:22.302 --> 32:36.039
include the woodlands. And I think probably in the 
background, the

32:36.059 --> 32:47.372
problems with the Montgomery County officials 
might have been responsible for that as much as

32:36.059 --> 32:47.372
anything. plus the fact that we did not want the 
city of Houston out here. We didn't want these

32:51.398 --> 32:58.209
small municipalities growing up out here like you 
see out in Memorial Drive, for instance. And in

32:58.229 --> 33:05.260
order to do that, we asked the city of Houston to 
extend its extraterritorial jurisdiction under

32:58.229 --> 33:05.260
Texas law, which Houston did, of course. And then 
along the way, we had to file a suit against

33:06.185 --> 33:17.901
Shenandoah because they ran a strip down the 
freeway, and they were trying to annex everything

33:06.185 --> 33:17.901
down to and including the area where the mall was. 
And we hired Will Sears' firm. Will just passed

33:23.289 --> 33:24.791
away the other day. Will Sears' firm, Sears and 
Burns in Houston, and filed suit and finally

33:24.991 --> 33:31.360
worked that out with Shenandoah. Involved in it 
was the location of the Woodlands Hospital and

33:31.380 --> 33:35.145
some other things. we got their their boundaries 
pushed north of the of the of the mall area where the

33:35.918 --> 34:03.529
new target pinecraft center would be what was the 
what was the motivation for that were they just

33:35.918 --> 34:03.529
trying to grab i think they were just trying to 
expand the city and and expand their tax base and

33:35.918 --> 34:03.529
they could foresee the development and the 
increase in value along the freeway there in

33:35.918 --> 34:03.529
particular but but their annexation strip 
description was erroneous for one thing. That was

34:09.120 --> 34:12.105
the basis on which the suit was filed. We have very 
good relations with the city of Shenandoah now, as

34:12.145 --> 34:16.551
far as I know. Excellent relations with them. One

34:19.495 --> 34:32.252
of the most unusual acquisitions, I guess, going 
back to the time when we were blocking up land, was

34:19.495 --> 34:32.252
the acquisition of this frontage on the freeway. 
It belonged to two different groups. One had an

34:35.786 --> 34:40.472
undivided half interest and another family group 
had the other one. We acquired the first undivided

34:40.492 --> 34:52.086
half interest with very little trouble, but the 
second remaining undivided half interest

34:40.492 --> 34:52.086
belonged to a Waco banker we called Robert Mann, by 
the name of Robert Mann. He had banking interests

34:53.107 --> 34:59.114
in Waco and several other Texas cities. And we 
negotiated with him Labor Day, I believe it was, in

35:02.200 --> 35:07.747
72, because we naturally wanted that land. We 
wanted his undivided half-interest. And we

35:11.151 --> 35:18.740
negotiated with him one Labor Day while he was 
trying to push us and pressure us because he had to

35:11.151 --> 35:18.740
catch a plane for Washington. And I had to call 
George back to the woodlands from Galveston where

35:19.501 --> 35:26.429
he was on his weekend vacation down there. And so 
before the day's end, though, we worked out a deal

35:27.310 --> 35:31.515
whereby we acquired It amounted to net 2,000 
acres. That's what it amounted to. It divided half

35:35.076 --> 35:39.342
inches in 4,000 acres of land along the freeway. 
And initially, another interesting thing to me is

35:40.584 --> 35:58.610
that initially we thought that Woodlands 
Parkway, what's now Woodlands Parkway, would

35:40.584 --> 35:58.610
have some commercial development along the 
sides, like the traditional strip centers down

35:40.584 --> 35:58.610
along 1960 and other places. And initially we had 
planned to do that. And but that idea was abandoned

36:01.769 --> 36:12.000
in favor of concentrating the commercial 
development in the neighborhoods and then the

36:01.769 --> 36:12.000
major commercial development along the freeway. 
But that was our initial plan. There's been some

36:13.521 --> 36:16.324
discussion, argument even, maybe. Well, maybe 
that's too strong a term. But at least discussion

36:17.566 --> 36:21.410
about the wisdom of doing that. Because from the 
freeway, all you see is a wall of trees. And it's

36:24.853 --> 36:26.875
sort of like, what's the woodlands? I mean, it's 
almost a secret blend you know and uh there was some

36:29.663 --> 36:54.962
some comment made by by some of the individuals 
we've talked to that um maybe the woodlands would

36:29.663 --> 36:54.962
have been a lot better off if they would have 
knocked down a few of those trees and as you could

36:29.663 --> 36:54.962
see into one of those lakes at least yeah you know as 
sort of a come on or an intriguing kind of uh well mr

36:29.663 --> 36:54.962
mitchell from the very outset has been very 
protective i know that's why there's a lot of

36:29.663 --> 36:54.962
knowledge Not only the trees, but the vegetation, 
you know. In fact, it took years before Roger

37:00.348 --> 37:13.867
Gladys was successful in clearing the 
intersections because the growth of the

37:00.348 --> 37:13.867
undergrowth and the trees and everything at 
intersections had begun to be a traffic hazard.

37:13.967 --> 37:15.008
Yeah, you couldn't see. We had several. And I don't 
know whether Mr. Mitchell ever totally agreed

37:16.791 --> 37:26.805
with him or not, but I do know that I was noticing 
this morning, as a matter of fact, as I came down off

37:16.791 --> 37:26.805
of Grogan's Mill Road onto Timberlock Place how 
much different it looks now from what it used to.

37:29.794 --> 37:37.141
And I think it's an improvement, not only 
aesthetically, but from a traffic safety

37:29.794 --> 37:37.141
standpoint. But I doubt if George ever wholly 
bought that idea because he loves those trees and

37:37.382 --> 37:43.568
those wildflowers and that underground. You live 
here in the woods? Yes. I live over here on Log Run

37:45.289 --> 37:48.833
Circle, just back of the country club. My wife and I 
moved out here in December of 79, just about a year

37:48.853 --> 37:55.459
before the company headquarters moved out here. 
So you, now this isn't, because not everyone in the

37:56.384 --> 38:04.295
Woodlands Company even lives in the woodlands. 
No, that's true. And, but you bought? I bought a

38:07.219 --> 38:20.417
house out here in early 79, knowing that the 
company was, you know, in the process of moving out

38:07.219 --> 38:20.417
here, and rented it for a while, and then moved into 
it in December of 79. I had trouble getting my wife

38:20.819 --> 38:32.718
out here because we'd been living for twenty years 
in Southwest Houston where all her friends, all

38:20.819 --> 38:32.718
the professional people that she used, and the 
church was four or five blocks away. It took me two

38:32.738 --> 38:34.541
years to find a house. But she's one of the greatest 
proponents of the Woodlands now, and she just

38:36.464 --> 38:42.534
loves the place. That's been a consistent 
problem. The Woodlands has a very keen, natural

38:47.988 --> 38:50.551
kind of environment. But I noticed that there's 
been several people who expressed concern that,

38:51.272 --> 38:57.180
you know, my gosh, what would my wife do here? I 
seemed isolated from whatever. This was a real

39:00.224 --> 39:01.325
problem. You know, I considered every possible 
alternative, commuting every day, which would

39:01.345 --> 39:10.257
have been an 80-mile round-trip commute from 
where we lived out near the Astrodome. And... Even

39:13.148 --> 39:22.361
renting an apartment and living out here the week 
and going back home on the weekends, but nothing

39:13.148 --> 39:22.361
seemed to really be the way to go. But finally, I 
found the house that she and I both fell in love

39:22.781 --> 39:30.572
with, and she has never been sorry that we moved out 
here. Wonderful place to live.

39:38.002 --> 39:42.008
The pavilion actually happened after you 
retired, didn't it?

39:45.464 --> 39:49.769
Well, let me ask you, this is sort of a standard 
question we've asked everyone. Let's see if that

39:49.789 --> 39:51.771
other one comes back to my head. It is obvious that 
the Woodlands Corporation has a culture that is

39:54.374 --> 40:03.564
unique, and the majority of that uniqueness comes 
from the personality of George Mitchell.

40:05.606 --> 40:08.830
Or a lot of it.

40:13.875 --> 40:14.796
At some point, Mr. Mitchell's presence in the 
Woodlands Corporation won't be either as strong

40:15.434 --> 40:20.940
or won't be there at all. He'll pass on, just as we 
all will. What do you foresee happening when that

40:23.943 --> 40:32.552
eventuality becomes a reality?

40:32.572 --> 40:35.094
That's a very difficult question. First, I don't 
like to think about it even, about him not being

40:35.174 --> 40:42.842
here, because having known George since 1946 and 
having worked with him about half of that time. I

40:44.063 --> 40:53.571
just can't foresee his vision and his ideas 
continuing, although we've got some very good

40:44.063 --> 40:53.571
people in the Woodlands Corporation. And I think, 
though, that with the impetus that's developed

40:55.193 --> 41:13.048
already, and which will continue, of course, as 
long as he's here, I think it will continue to be the

40:55.193 --> 41:13.048
development that it was originally planned to be, 
which was about a city of about 150,000 people.

41:14.075 --> 41:25.750
with diversity of residential construction so 
that we could avoid in the woodlands what's

41:14.075 --> 41:25.750
happened in every major city in the country, the 
inner city slums and that type of thing. And that

41:25.830 --> 41:30.035
idea has caught on out here, and it's worked very 
satisfactorily. And I think certainly that it

41:30.075 --> 41:36.083
would be sad indeed if whoever takes over the 
Woodlands Corporation didn't continue that

41:36.805 --> 41:46.158
throughout the total acreage yet available for 
development. And the recreational facilities

41:46.178 --> 41:56.352
available to the residents and to the public in 
general out here are the finest in the land. I don't

41:56.372 --> 42:05.665
know of anything it even compares that I've been to 
unless it's Hilton Head, and I think we're rapidly

41:56.372 --> 42:05.665
passing Hilton Head because I haven't been to some 
of the ones in Florida and California, but I think

42:06.775 --> 42:14.566
this concept has proven to be so successful that I 
think it will continue. I think it will continue. I

42:17.390 --> 42:36.276
think the real blossoming of the woodlands, and 
again, I'm getting a lot of these ideas from George

42:17.390 --> 42:36.276
Mitchell, from listening to him talk, but it 
really hasn't blossomed yet, probably another

42:17.390 --> 42:36.276
five, six, seven or eight years before it does with 
the continued development of the research

42:17.390 --> 42:36.276
forest. area over there, which just is that the 
possibilities that that will bring to the

42:36.880 --> 42:44.834
woodlands is just unlimited. Now, it seems to be a 
major impetus anyway. Yes, right. That's part of

42:48.240 --> 42:49.602
the— Definitely. Of the, you know, we want people 
to work here and live here and play here, and the

42:49.883 --> 42:59.800
types of industries that they're promoting over 
there, you know, it's very encouraging. In fact,

43:00.134 --> 43:05.260
you know, it's to the point almost now where 
there's really no reason. My wife and I don't see

43:05.480 --> 43:07.983
any reason to go anywhere on vacation. Where would 
we go? What would we do that we can't do right here in

43:08.724 --> 43:11.628
the woodlands? And I really like that. I really 
like that and love. And, of course, we're up over

43:16.173 --> 43:26.906
30,000 people now in spite of the recessions we've 
been through out here, which I think speaks well

43:16.173 --> 43:26.906
for the idea and the way it's being pursued. Do you 
think that, in fact, is the foundational... of the

43:32.011 --> 43:53.640
community, perhaps, is the fact that the 
residents themselves are so loyal to the concepts

43:32.011 --> 43:53.640
that Mr. Mitchell provided that, in fact, there's 
this sort of residual

43:32.011 --> 43:53.640
allegiance to those concepts, so that were he 
there or were he not there, those concepts would

43:32.011 --> 43:53.640
continue. I believe they will. I believe they 
will. I believe most of the residents are. You hear

43:57.045 --> 44:01.090
a little grumbling now and then about this or that, 
but that's to be expected. But I think there's a

44:01.880 --> 44:15.259
tremendous loyalty and resonance to the 
woodlands and the concept and the desire to see

44:01.880 --> 44:15.259
that it remains the way it was envisioned, you 
know, and the way it's been developed under his

44:01.880 --> 44:15.259
leadership. I guess that is. Is there anything I 
should have asked that I haven't? Well, I may think

44:21.387 --> 44:30.300
of something after you leave, Don, but I think 
we've certainly, from the standpoint of the

44:21.387 --> 44:30.300
things that I've been involved in here... I think 
we've pretty well covered the waterfront, but if

44:31.023 --> 44:40.178
you'll leave me a card or something where I can get 
back with you if I think of something. We're going

44:40.218 --> 44:43.444
to get back in touch with you anyway, because I want 
you to read the transcript. Okay, all right. Let me

44:44.726 --> 44:49.133
give it some thought, if I think of anything that we 
may not have covered.
