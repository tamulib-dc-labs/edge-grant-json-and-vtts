00:01.516 --> 00:21.548
who has been at Texas A&M since 1973 and

00:01.516 --> 00:21.548
is in the Department of Educational 
Administration and is going to share a few ideas or

00:01.516 --> 00:21.548
thoughts about changes that have occurred at 
Texas A&M since 1973 or since you arrived. And can

00:22.810 --> 00:27.658
you tell me from your perception or your vantage 
point what have been some of the major changes that

00:28.162 --> 00:32.046
have impacted the university or the College of 
Education? Well, the impact of the College of Ed,

00:32.066 --> 00:40.956
of course, is we've had a change in the dean, the 
dean's office and the department head office.

00:40.976 --> 00:44.961
When I came there in 73, of course, Frank Hubert was 
the dean. And now Dean Corrigan is the dean. And

00:50.727 --> 00:53.631
Harold Hawkins was the department head. And now 
Dave Earleson's the department head as far as

00:57.524 --> 01:05.462
Administratively, those have been significant 
changes, and then from the standpoint of

00:57.524 --> 01:05.462
enrollment, size of faculty. When I came there, 
there were four professors in the department, and

01:06.043 --> 01:13.761
now there are 11 full-time tenured faculty or 
tenure-track faculty. We admitted an average of

01:14.078 --> 01:27.452
22 doctoral students and master's students a 
year, and now we admit somewhere around 60 a year.

01:28.232 --> 01:42.567
In the last two years alone, we've admitted 86 
doctoral students in just two years, and from 1975

01:28.232 --> 01:42.567
to 81,

01:28.232 --> 01:42.567
we only admitted 122 graduate students total. 
into the program. So our numbers have grown

01:44.950 --> 01:47.772
significantly. What are you attributing all of 
this to?

01:53.277 --> 02:07.809
Well, the growth of the university is probably 
based on the need for master's and particularly

01:53.277 --> 02:07.809
doctoral degrees in public school 
administration to move up into the top leadership

01:53.277 --> 02:07.809
positions in this state. Used to be a master's 
degree in certification would make you eligible

02:08.450 --> 02:12.553
for the top level positions, and now it's the PhD or 
the EDD is required to get in line to be eligible to

02:12.989 --> 02:22.542
secure the positions. Okay. Because you've 
mentioned the two leaderships in the college and

02:24.144 --> 02:40.486
in the department, how has the leadership in both 
of those affected the climate or the culture of the

02:24.144 --> 02:40.486
number one, the department, being that that was a 
change, or the college? Well, Frank Hubert, you

02:42.892 --> 02:53.865
know, and his, you might say, autocratic 
administrative leadership style, he literally

02:42.892 --> 02:53.865
caught all the shots for the college and for the 
departments. I sat in an admissions meeting with

02:53.885 --> 03:08.443
Frank where he'd literally have the whole pile of 
candidates in front of him, and he'd go through and

02:53.885 --> 03:08.443
say, accept, deny, accept, deny, and when he got 
done with that process, he'd tell the faculty on

03:09.368 --> 03:12.652
And that's the way our admissions were ran. I mean, 
Frank literally selected who he wanted into the

03:12.672 --> 03:17.779
admin department. And where when Dean Corrigan 
came in, of course, he turned over to Hawkins,

03:17.799 --> 03:26.730
total control of the department. And at that 
point, the faculty selected the candidates. And

03:30.415 --> 03:36.102
of course, David Erlandson, who came in after 
Hawkins, He's a very democratic leader, and

03:36.503 --> 03:53.023
we as a total faculty make all the decisions on 
policy and key decisions as it relates to

03:36.503 --> 03:53.023
curriculum, employment of our faculty. Again, 
one to Frank Hubert's era, you'd go up and

03:53.925 --> 03:58.891
interview with Frank, and he either hired you or he 
didn't. The department head was merely a

03:58.911 --> 04:04.097
personnel director that lined up the final 
interview. And now with Dean Corrigan, There the

04:06.895 --> 04:12.622
department makes a decision and the 
recommendation goes to the dean and in eight years

04:06.895 --> 04:12.622
he's been there. I've never known him to deny the 
request of the faculty for any new faculty member

04:12.662 --> 04:21.334
that we wanted nor ever got involved with the 
admissions process. Dean Corgan's never sat in on

04:21.614 --> 04:27.802
one admissions meeting in all the years he's been 
dean of our college. And when Frank Hubert was

04:27.822 --> 04:32.788
here, we never had an admissions meeting unless 
Frank was going to be there. So those, you know, as

04:32.808 --> 04:35.552
related to students, he's selected. His criteria 
was 99% GRE. And under Dean Corrigan, we select our

04:39.351 --> 04:44.399
own students. And we have seven different 
variables, including GRE as one of the seven for

04:45.200 --> 04:49.628
admissions. So it's a much more flexible, open, 
realistic admissions process. And that's

04:55.437 --> 04:59.363
directly attributed to the two different drastic 
styles. of leadership in the dean's office and to

04:59.528 --> 05:26.987
some extent a change in leadership style from the 
department because harold hawkins pretty much

04:59.528 --> 05:26.987
followed the dean's lead as far as being an 
autocratic leader he didn't delegate or turn

04:59.528 --> 05:26.987
loose much power and authority to the faculty 
where david delegates almost everything to the

04:59.528 --> 05:26.987
faculty where possible and so the climate of the 
organizations probably had 180 degree change in

05:27.305 --> 05:31.815
the two administrations. Was it hard to adjust to 
not having a lot of input to having so much input? Do

05:38.631 --> 05:40.435
people handle that pretty well? Well, in that 
admin department, where all of us who are in the

05:41.537 --> 05:46.849
department have come there with a tremendous 
amount of administrative experience and were

05:47.082 --> 06:04.469
used to calling the shots in organizations or 
having a leadership style which we insisted that

05:47.082 --> 06:04.469
our subordinates share in the decision-making 
process. No, it was very easy for us. It was very

06:06.091 --> 06:07.033
refreshing. It was a sigh of relief that now we had 
control. of the department and in essence we're

06:09.897 --> 06:22.540
going to be successful or fail based on our own 
input knowledge and awareness of how we could run

06:09.897 --> 06:22.540
that department and many of us ran far bigger 
faculties and staffs professionally before we

06:22.823 --> 06:36.100
got to the university than any of us collectively 
ever had to participate in such a small department

06:22.823 --> 06:36.100
of 8, 9, 10, 11 faculty members. And none of us were 
really used to working for a superordinate like

06:36.200 --> 06:46.013
Frank Huber who totally, you know, was an 
autocratic leader and made all the decisions for

06:36.200 --> 06:46.013
us. We resented it as a faculty, and some of that 
resentment was so obvious that some of the early

06:46.668 --> 07:02.432
faculty members did not get tenure and were forced 
to leave because, quite frankly, Dean Huber

06:46.668 --> 07:02.432
didn't like them. So he got rid of them. He just 
didn't put them on tenure, and so they had to leave.

07:06.038 --> 07:07.941
So he made all the tenure decisions as well. Oh, 
absolutely. Frank, if Frank didn't like you, you

07:08.926 --> 07:12.232
were in big trouble. You just didn't stay around 
very long. And if Frank liked you or if he perceived

07:14.817 --> 07:21.068
you were doing your job, you didn't have any 
problems with him. I personally never had a

07:21.188 --> 07:25.416
problem with him from the moment he hired me. until 
the day he retired. I never had a bad word with him

07:27.731 --> 07:30.173
and got along with him well. But I was such a junior 
faculty, working on soft money, he had no reason,

07:30.694 --> 07:46.813
he and I had no reason to cross and all the things he 
heard about what the department was doing and the

07:30.694 --> 07:46.813
area I was responsible for was all positive, so he 
had no reason to get upset with what I was doing as an

07:30.694 --> 07:46.813
individual. OK, now the college, like you said, 
has changed somewhat in the climate and the

07:47.637 --> 07:55.385
culture because of the two drastic changes. 
However, the mission has remained pretty much the

07:55.485 --> 08:04.314
same, the teaching, the research, and the 
service, which is in conjunction with the mission

07:55.485 --> 08:04.314
of a land-grant university. To what extent do you 
feel that the college is achieving its mission?

08:09.940 --> 08:13.403
And in what proportion, maybe, of the teaching, 
research? Because I think it has shifted

08:13.464 --> 08:15.906
somewhat. maybe even within the two 
administrations? Yeah, I think teaching is

08:18.586 --> 08:30.003
obviously the number one area that is getting the 
most attention now at the university. I think back

08:30.063 --> 08:43.463
in the earlier year, particularly under Dean 
Hubert, with the faculty as small as it was, at

08:30.063 --> 08:43.463
least in the admin department, and I think to a 
great extent the other departments, there was a

08:30.063 --> 08:43.463
lot off-campus offerings throughout the state, 
Temple, Belton, Killeen, Houston, the Valley,

08:43.932 --> 08:53.205
San Angelo, the Beaumont area. A lot of courses 
were taken off campus to serve the needs of

08:53.585 --> 09:01.456
students through the extension program. And the 
last few years, you know, most of those programs

09:02.077 --> 09:06.283
have dried up. The university has has more went 
into a teaching research posture, where teaching

09:07.726 --> 09:27.675
primarily on the main campus and emphasizing 
research and now service to the field is just a

09:07.726 --> 09:27.675
secondary or byproduct of the College of 
Education. We used to go down, several

09:27.655 --> 09:37.649
departments would go down to Houston and for two 
years we did the certification on-site for all of

09:27.655 --> 09:37.649
HISD's central office administrators. We used to 
teach in Austin and train their administrators in

09:38.310 --> 09:43.877
the central office. We literally had a network of 
off-campus sites all over the state of Texas. and

09:51.027 --> 10:17.305
now the only off-campus center we maintain is here 
in San Antonio and we are the only department in the

09:51.027 --> 10:17.305
college other than IDED that is doing any type of 
off-campus teaching and all the other

09:51.027 --> 10:17.305
departments have come back into the university 
and are very content to have the students come to

10:18.179 --> 10:28.119
the campus to get the instruction and are not 
willing to send their faculty off-campus anymore

10:18.179 --> 10:28.119
to do the off-campus. So is it de-emphasizing the 
service part of it? However, this department is

10:31.044 --> 10:36.976
perceived by a lot of the other departments as 
being very service-oriented. So does everybody

10:36.996 --> 10:40.423
feel that Service is the emphasis of the 
department versus research, specifically

10:40.403 --> 10:47.673
research, because there seems to be. If the 
faculty was honest, they'd say we're probably 40%

10:47.954 --> 10:58.108
teaching, 40% service, and about 20% research. in 
reality because with the principal center that's

10:58.088 --> 11:21.463
certainly a service center entity the community 
ed center the higher ed center now that stan

10:58.088 --> 11:21.463
carpenter's developed in the process of 
developing the ucea connection we had with

10:58.088 --> 11:21.463
editing through phil west etc that was a lot of 
service oriented type of activities then the

10:58.088 --> 11:21.463
heavy numbers of in excess of 200 full-time 
doctoral enrollments in the department now.

11:29.263 --> 11:34.120
Those two things probably occupy about 80% of our 
time, and then there's 20% research. I don't see

11:35.371 --> 11:44.024
that much individual faculty research going on 
that is not directly connected with dissertation

11:35.371 --> 11:44.024
research. I think, now if you take into 
consideration dissertation research, that

11:44.504 --> 12:01.609
percentage might go up, but when I think of 
research at universities, I think of faculty

11:44.504 --> 12:01.609
members going out on their own doing some creative 
experimental research by themselves and then

11:44.504 --> 12:01.609
writing that up and that making a contribution. I 
don't see our faculty in our department doing that

12:02.230 --> 12:06.795
much independent research. Does the faculty get 
any pressure from the administration to increase

12:06.895 --> 12:14.524
research activity and decrease service, or do 
they? If it is, I haven't been aware of it, no. I

12:18.148 --> 12:29.301
think that our dean is satisfied that we are making 
an impact in the state by the service that we are

12:29.669 --> 12:35.979
rendering through the different programs within 
the department. And he knows we're finishing

12:35.999 --> 12:54.246
larger than usual records of studies and 
dissertations that he hasn't really put any

12:35.999 --> 12:54.246
pressure on the department or any of the faculty 
members, as I'm aware of. Does that affect the

12:54.266 --> 12:55.508
tenure? Anything on your evaluation for tenure? I 
don't think so. I think

12:59.734 --> 13:05.498
if you're teaching your load, providing some 
external services to the field, taking care of

13:07.098 --> 13:25.121
your students and maintaining your office hours, 
publishing occasional journal articles based on

13:07.098 --> 13:25.121
research of your students or some independent 
research that you conduct as a faculty member.

13:26.183 --> 13:28.245
We've never had that pressure. Oh, thank you. Very 
good. We appreciate that. What did you do, run?

13:33.812 --> 13:34.253
Thank you. OK. Now, has the tremendous growth that 
you talked about earlier affected how you were

13:34.857 --> 13:42.469
able to work with students? And the growth has been 
more in the undergraduate, but you expressed it's

13:43.130 --> 13:48.918
also grown tremendously in your department. How 
has that affected your ability to work with

13:49.039 --> 13:53.946
students like you'd like on a one-on-one? I think 
that I spend probably 80% of my time working with

13:55.192 --> 14:01.709
students. Last year, I finished 16 PhDs and ADDs. I 
chaired eight of those, and I sat on eight more. And

14:08.566 --> 14:11.614
with the San Antonio program here, I probably and 
responsible for somewhere from 25 to 40% of all the

14:12.185 --> 14:17.211
new admissions that come into the department. I 
recruit them and bring them in for the department.

14:20.394 --> 14:29.124
So I spend about 80% of my time on taking care of 
students and teaching in the off-campus setting.

14:29.545 --> 14:34.150
And by the nature of my research course, I'm still 
actively involved with students developing

14:29.545 --> 14:34.150
their proposals. So I'm extremely busy, but I 
don't think anyone's being neglected. because of

14:40.788 --> 14:43.832
the large numbers we deal with. I choose to work 
with students and spend a lot of time taking care of

14:44.012 --> 14:58.391
their needs, and this may be an excuse why I don't 
publish as much as probably some people would like

14:44.012 --> 14:58.391
me to, but it hadn't affected me. Can you share some 
ideas of what your perceptions are of the

14:58.491 --> 15:06.441
collaboration among departments within the 
college, or maybe even collaboration within

14:58.491 --> 15:06.441
other colleges, Probably during the last three or 
four years, and I directly attribute this to Dean

15:08.108 --> 15:20.886
Corrigan's administration and leadership style 
encouragement for it to happen, I've seen a

15:08.108 --> 15:20.886
tremendous amount of cooperation between the 
departments. An example of that is the

15:23.450 --> 15:39.381
instructional management certificate between 
EDCI and Ed Admin where we jointly collaborate

15:23.450 --> 15:39.381
with about an 86 to 90 hour doctoral program and we 
really don't care where the student gets the

15:23.450 --> 15:39.381
degree in EDCI or Ed Ad. They take almost an equal 
amount of hours Four or five years ago that wasn't

15:41.605 --> 15:57.895
even conceivable, let alone possible, because of 
the structure of the departments and the rigidity

15:41.605 --> 15:57.895
of the administration that kept us all pretty well 
turfed to our own areas and we didn't integrate or

15:41.605 --> 15:57.895
have an interdisciplinary approach. With Dean 
Corrigan, we have a lot of interaction now with the

16:05.281 --> 16:25.669
various departments, the pro-seminars that were 
developed in 78, 79 through the Record of Study

16:05.281 --> 16:25.669
program, you might say had forced integration 
potential where it required the six departments

16:05.281 --> 16:25.669
to work together in providing the pro-seminar 
experience, and that was really the beginning for

16:25.649 --> 16:27.331
this working cooperative. And then as we got to be 
more familiar with each other as faculty members

16:27.391 --> 16:40.349
and as disciplines, more collaborative 
interaction, you know, occurred. And now we've

16:40.389 --> 16:50.442
got lots of interactions with various 
departments, mainly within the college, but over

16:40.389 --> 16:50.442
with Mildred Fox Shop and I, industrial 
engineering, That's another example. We've done

16:51.771 --> 16:55.096
a lot of work with them over the last five or six 
years. And so I think it's been positive. It's

17:00.504 --> 17:02.807
going on. It continues to grow. And we now have a 
mentality of an interdisciplinary approach to

17:04.590 --> 17:15.846
educating doctoral students rather than a 
departmental approach to educating doctoral

17:04.590 --> 17:15.846
students. Who was the name that you mentioned in 
industrial ed? No, industrial engineering. I'm

17:23.394 --> 17:24.015
sorry. It's Mildren Fox. Mildren, 
M-I-L-D-R-E-N? Mm-hmm. And he teaches the

17:28.041 --> 17:35.794
collective bargaining, arbitration, and the 
public and private sector. It's a 10-hour block

17:36.315 --> 17:42.444
that deals with the whole domain of arbitration, 
collective bargaining, negotiation. And ed-ac

17:42.464 --> 17:43.586
students have to take that? It's a support field 
for a minor, for ed-ad majors and we have a large

17:47.695 --> 18:07.290
number of our majors do elect to take the i 
engineering support field because of its

17:47.695 --> 18:07.290
implication for unions and grievances and 
collective bargaining and that whole nine yards

17:47.695 --> 18:07.290
of which is just for the, not so much for the 
educator here in the south, but you know, Shanker

18:07.642 --> 18:20.380
supposedly five or six years ago said Texas was 
going to be the next area that they tried to get

18:07.642 --> 18:20.380
involved with unions. Well, it really hasn't 
happened, but the material that Fox covers in

18:20.420 --> 18:35.522
there is of such interest to the administrators, 
and I think it helps them work with negotiating

18:20.420 --> 18:35.522
contracts, working with school boards to 
negotiate contracts with teachers, and it's

18:20.420 --> 18:35.522
still a beneficial support field. Okay, the next 
question has to do with your perceptions of how

18:35.502 --> 18:42.332
outsiders view the College of Education at A&M. Do 
you have a feel for that since you do some

18:42.352 --> 18:44.976
traveling? Yeah, I think, again, in the early 
years, you've got to understand the college was

18:45.197 --> 18:51.426
formed in 1969. I got there in 73. We were an unknown 
entity probably up through, even through the 70s.

18:58.617 --> 19:04.446
I think around 1980 and beyond, and certainly in 
the last three or four years, with the

19:04.763 --> 19:28.898
leadership of Dean Corrigan, the fact that he was 
selected as the only dean on the select committee

19:04.763 --> 19:28.898
to work with Ross Perot, and that got so much press 
with House Bill 72 and the involvement of our

19:04.763 --> 19:28.898
college and the certification, the training of 
administrators. and the numbers that we're

19:29.182 --> 19:47.646
training and producing on an annual basis I think 
has moved us to the forefront in the eyes of many of

19:29.182 --> 19:47.646
the educators across this state that we are now the 
college of education in the state that probably

19:29.182 --> 19:47.646
has the best overall delivery of doctoral 
certification and master's students in

19:48.335 --> 20:02.011
education and I think that's probably a complete 
turnaround from when I came here in 73 to what it is

19:48.335 --> 20:02.011
today. Okay how about maybe a vision of what you 
feel that that's facing and the college appears to

20:03.874 --> 20:13.465
be at a crossroads because of the undergraduate 
program being drastically affected with these

20:14.103 --> 20:21.553
new changes, how do you see the future of the 
College of Education at this point? It's hard to

20:21.573 --> 20:29.503
say what the impact of 994 is going to be on the 
teacher education part of the College of Ed. I

20:29.523 --> 20:40.677
think from the standpoint of the Ed Psych 
Department, from the Ed Admin Department, the

20:29.523 --> 20:40.677
IDED Department, particularly... All the 
non-teachers. Yeah, the non-teaching areas.

20:42.380 --> 20:42.760
We're We're only going to increase in numbers of 
quality and quantity of students with I think

20:43.128 --> 21:02.572
you'll see more of an emphasis on minority 
recruitment and actually completion, retention

20:43.128 --> 21:02.572
and completion of those students through our 
program. I see the quality of the program

21:03.713 --> 21:09.000
continuing to get better and better. the 
opportunity for a minority to become faculty

21:09.217 --> 21:22.494
members with our department, which will add 
another dimension to deal with this increased

21:09.217 --> 21:22.494
population of administrators that we'll be 
dealing with. And I just see things getting more

21:22.675 --> 21:36.152
quality, a better program,

21:22.675 --> 21:36.152
perhaps a little bit more emphasis on urban 
education because of the strong need for urban

21:36.824 --> 21:51.386
school administrators and so many of our urban 
school districts so highly inundated with

21:36.824 --> 21:51.386
minority populations, both black and Hispanic. I 
think we may change our emphasis to more of an urban

21:51.406 --> 21:56.253
curriculum than a rural curriculum. Most of our 
doctoral students are coming from the larger

21:58.016 --> 22:03.224
urban areas. And that's where they need tend to 
need that terminal degree to sustain those upward

22:06.575 --> 22:15.645
mobility and to keep the top administrative 
positions. In the rural areas, certification and

22:15.685 --> 22:23.234
just some years of experience seem to be enough 
education. But as we get into the urban setting and

22:23.294 --> 22:29.040
the big suburbans around these urban school 
districts, the doctorate's almost mandatory.

22:29.541 --> 22:31.784
And I think that's where we're going to see the 
change. Well, and the fact, too, that you have

22:31.804 --> 22:33.966
brought it part of the campus to San Antonio, for 
example, has increased that or has helped that

22:34.638 --> 22:48.901
considerably because it has made it at least a 
feasible possibility for the people that have to

22:34.638 --> 22:48.901
work full-time and cannot possibly move over 
there full-time. Right, and I think that the

22:49.322 --> 23:00.460
market here in San Antonio, of course, will only 
increase for us as we are capable of handling

22:49.322 --> 23:00.460
larger numbers of

23:05.468 --> 23:07.651
doctoral students myself in a few short years. 
I've been down here and probably have 30 or 40 in the

23:07.731 --> 23:15.460
process now, and probably 60% of those are 
minority. There you are. But you don't

23:18.965 --> 23:21.248
necessarily recruit the minorities. It's just 
the way it happens, or are you aggressively

23:21.268 --> 23:26.774
pursuing the minority recruitment? I probably 
more aggressively recruit minority if I feel by

23:26.794 --> 23:34.564
reviewing their transcripts and interviewing 
them one-on-one, that they really have the

23:34.949 --> 23:53.869
ability, the interest to pursue a doctorate, I 
probably try to encourage them that they can do it

23:34.949 --> 23:53.869
and that I'll help them more so than I would maybe 
some non-minority students, just because the

23:54.541 --> 23:59.973
numbers of those folks are always out there. And 
the fact, too, that we draw those in, other faculty

23:59.993 --> 24:11.419
members draw those in from other parts of the 
state, and I think one of the advantages of me being

23:59.993 --> 24:11.419
down here, and purposes, quite frankly, is to... 
to increase the minority pool in the university

24:11.737 --> 24:24.928
and department and to get these folks in the 
programs and to graduate them, get them back out in

24:11.737 --> 24:24.928
these top leadership positions, which we've 
already demonstrated we can do and we have done. So

24:25.008 --> 24:27.050
I think it's worth it. OK. Do you have something 
that stands out in your mind as a highlight of the

24:27.070 --> 24:37.579
time, the years that you have spent at Texas A&M, or 
maybe a contribution? And we've already touched

24:37.839 --> 24:41.642
on a lot of the contributions you've made by the 
recruiting traveling to San Antonio weekly to

24:41.926 --> 24:45.051
teach and so forth. But is there something, an 
insight, or something that stands out? Well,

24:50.059 --> 24:57.511
probably for me, it's been the opportunity to work 
with the community education movement in the

24:50.059 --> 24:57.511
state. And the fact when I came here, there were six 
school districts that had community education.

25:02.278 --> 25:07.066
And today, there are in excess of over 100 school 
districts. And I more or less had... input on

25:10.090 --> 25:25.613
almost all of those coming into being, and 
particularly in the San Antonio, Austin, and the

25:10.090 --> 25:25.613
Rio Grande area, which comprises probably 50% of 
all the community ed projects in the state. You

25:25.853 --> 25:33.364
know, I personally started all those projects, 
trained the directors, and served as their

25:25.853 --> 25:33.364
consultant for many years that that we've been in 
existence and to have that opportunity to go out

25:33.850 --> 25:51.069
and then stand back eight, ten years later and look 
at a place like Austin that's got 29,000

25:33.850 --> 25:51.069
non-duplicated enrollments in their community 
at evening classes, over 100,000 participants.

25:51.089 --> 26:00.820
Then you come down the road to Comal, New 
Bronzeville and look at the success of those

25:51.089 --> 26:00.820
programs and you move into the San Antonio area 
where we originally got the SAISD involved, which

26:00.800 --> 26:18.117
led us to Northeast, and now Northside is 
developing an excellent community ed model, and

26:00.800 --> 26:18.117
from Edgewood and East Central, South Sand, 
Harlandale, you know, it's gratifying to me to see

26:00.800 --> 26:18.117
the fruits of my labor that was availed to me by the 
fact that I was at a major university that had a

26:18.383 --> 26:46.066
grant from a private foundation that gave me the 
latitude and freedom to go out and work in these

26:18.383 --> 26:46.066
school districts and try out some ideas and they 
were embraced by what I call futuristic leaders

26:18.383 --> 26:46.066
who saw the potential and now we have quite a strong 
community education network in what I call the

26:18.383 --> 26:46.066
I-35 syndrome from Dallas-Fort Worth all the way 
down through San Antonio and that's probably the

26:18.383 --> 26:46.066
highlight of my career. I think A lot of people 
could have come in and developed the off-campus

26:46.868 --> 26:53.497
program in San Antonio because there was such a 
need for it. And the availability of a university

26:53.517 --> 27:01.507
like A&M to want to do off-campus work, that in 
itself I don't think is that unique. But the

27:01.527 --> 27:12.201
ability, I think, with my 21 years in community ed 
to help start so many of these 100 school districts

27:01.527 --> 27:12.201
that I personally was the original contact the 
trainer, the follow-up consultant to these

27:12.586 --> 27:25.484
projects, and then see them sustain themselves 
far beyond after I left or had any influence at all

27:12.586 --> 27:25.484
on the success of those programs, that's probably 
the high spot for me. Well, now that that soft money

27:25.784 --> 27:30.330
has sort of dwindled, what do you see happening? 
Because community ed has picked up momentum in a

27:30.350 --> 27:39.583
lot of places, and it's almost, like they said, 
something whose time has come now, and it's coming

27:30.350 --> 27:39.583
of age. What is happening, and I know the center is 
still at Texas A&M and probably will continue

27:41.155 --> 27:47.523
there because it is getting support from the 
university. Do you perceive any changes there? I

27:50.527 --> 28:09.492
think when we only saw about nine or ten of the 
districts folding when the soft money this year

27:50.527 --> 28:09.492
finally ended is a strong indication that we've 
hit upon a philosophy or an idea that once

27:50.527 --> 28:09.492
implanted in a local school district's 
leadership style or philosophy of education is

28:10.788 --> 28:23.807
very difficult to remove from the system, that I 
think community education as we have developed it

28:10.788 --> 28:23.807
here will be around for many, many years in the 
future. I'm concerned about the expansion of

28:23.948 --> 28:32.340
projects

28:23.948 --> 28:32.340
so that new school districts will some outside 
influence of either state funding again for pilot

28:34.362 --> 29:04.150
projects or private foundation money but as far as 
sustaining the network of approximately 100

28:34.362 --> 29:04.150
school districts between now and the year 2000 I 
think in 10-12 years from now we'll probably have

28:34.362 --> 29:04.150
80% of what we're working with right now will still 
be in place but yet that only represents about 10%

28:34.362 --> 29:04.150
of school districts in the state and if we don't get 
some outside support from either legislature or

29:04.653 --> 29:15.464
from some private foundation like we had in the 
early years of the development of Community Ed in

29:04.653 --> 29:15.464
Texas, I don't think we'll see any growth and I 
think that'll be regrettable. Our growth may be in

29:16.185 --> 29:34.423
the standpoint of occasionally adding new 
projects, but I think those new projects will be

29:16.185 --> 29:34.423
added by former graduate students of our program 
who take the Community Ed curriculum or courses

29:16.185 --> 29:34.423
and believe in it as a leadership style, implement 
the program as part of their offerings to a local

29:34.859 --> 29:53.425
school district in turn for hiring them and 
that'll probably just maintain what we lose of

29:34.859 --> 29:53.425
those districts that have a change in 
administration of boards or superintendent and

29:34.859 --> 29:53.425
decide not to fund again and we'll maybe pick up 
those numbers by new young administrators coming

29:34.859 --> 29:53.425
in and developing but I don't think in the next five 
to ten years if we don't have any influence of state

29:56.071 --> 30:14.474
legislation or some priority by the state board 
that will give some incentives to local school

29:56.071 --> 30:14.474
districts to expand their use of public schools 
and go into the... Do you think the elected state

29:56.071 --> 30:14.474
board will have any impact? Will it change 
attitudes in any way? Because the support has not

30:18.058 --> 30:23.445
been there legislatively recently, or at least 
not as much as it's needed, right? It's hard to say.
