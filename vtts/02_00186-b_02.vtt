WEBVTT

00:03.693 --> 00:05.315
He went to veterinary practice.

00:05.716 --> 00:08.580
In fact, he married a girl in his class.

00:10.002 --> 00:10.903
Another little story.

00:10.923 --> 00:11.604
I hope you don't mind.

00:11.644 --> 00:13.868
No, we want the story.

00:13.888 --> 00:15.310
They decided to get married.

00:15.950 --> 00:16.631
They were seniors.

00:17.312 --> 00:19.716
And this was in, like, March.

00:19.876 --> 00:21.518
They're going to graduate in a couple months.

00:22.360 --> 00:25.444
I said, would you, Martha, because we knew we'd have them out to dinner every now and then.

00:25.464 --> 00:26.205
It would be real close.

00:27.066 --> 00:27.787
Would you come out?

00:28.969 --> 00:32.434
Would you come to our wedding?

00:33.798 --> 00:42.333
Gosh, who was the associate pastor, not the associate pastor, but student minister, Presbyterian Student Minister, Mike?

00:43.635 --> 00:44.617
Oh, yeah.

00:44.637 --> 00:45.919
You know, tall Mike.

00:46.520 --> 00:46.781
Yeah, yeah.

00:46.801 --> 00:46.901
Okay.

00:47.342 --> 00:49.365
Anyway, he was the minister for the wedding.

00:49.746 --> 00:53.433
They had the wedding in a horse lot off North Avenue.

00:55.096 --> 00:58.742
Well, that's not all, but they started the wedding and the horse

00:58.807 --> 01:06.196
got sick when the colic went down the side, started rolling around, we had to stop the wetting, got the horse treated.

01:06.236 --> 01:09.760
And then Mike, he'd never been in something like this.

01:09.780 --> 01:14.266
Here you had these horses and dogs running around, barking all the time, but they wanted to have their wetting outside.

01:14.306 --> 01:19.652
So anyway, that student, they both went to San Angelo, practiced for a while.

01:20.253 --> 01:23.397
They finally decided to go their own ways.

01:23.377 --> 01:25.039
He decided to go back to school.

01:25.099 --> 01:26.120
He got a Ph.D.

01:26.440 --> 01:29.964
in epidemiology from the University of Houston Health Science Center.

01:30.765 --> 01:35.970
And he did his work on Lou Gehrig's disease in Guam.

01:36.991 --> 01:40.996
And he worked for five years at Mayo Clinic in their graduate program.

01:41.036 --> 01:44.619
Now he's back at the University of Houston, I mean University of Texas.

01:44.840 --> 01:46.441
So I'm proud of that.

01:46.461 --> 01:49.965
There's some money like that I guess.

01:51.567 --> 01:52.708
There's others I can't.

01:52.790 --> 01:58.202
Did you remember any graduate student ever asking you to bail them out financially, lend them some money?

01:58.222 --> 01:59.304
Oh yeah, yeah, yeah.

01:59.324 --> 02:06.259
I had one, one girl graduate student wanted me to loan her money to buy a car, $800.

02:07.268 --> 02:22.606
And the more I got into it, she said, I'll pay you back, but then I checked with the, I forget who I checked with, I guess it was Bookman Peterson, don't do that because you're going to get in problems because you're going to be responsible if she does that car, so I didn't.

02:22.746 --> 02:27.192
And she wasn't with us long anyway, so I remember that.

02:27.752 --> 02:32.618
Nobody ever called you from jail to be bailed out or?

02:33.560 --> 02:34.604
Seemed like one did.

02:35.909 --> 02:37.475
I can't remember.

02:37.495 --> 02:40.406
It's terrible.

02:40.426 --> 02:40.687
No?

02:41.310 --> 02:41.410
Okay.

02:41.542 --> 02:45.567
All right, now back into the mainstream of the classes.

02:45.747 --> 02:45.867
Yeah.

02:45.887 --> 02:49.011
You continued teaching epidemiology.

02:49.031 --> 02:49.332
Right, yeah.

02:49.492 --> 02:50.053
And what else?

02:50.774 --> 02:52.356
Epidemiology, food safety.

02:52.436 --> 02:55.279
We developed zoonoses course, animal disease transmitted.

02:55.299 --> 02:55.800
What was that word?

02:56.020 --> 02:56.941
Zoonoses.

02:56.961 --> 02:57.682
Zoonoses.

02:57.702 --> 02:58.223
Zoonoses.

02:58.263 --> 03:00.846
Z-O-O-N-O-S-E-S.

03:00.866 --> 03:06.874
That's animal diseases transmitted from animals to humans, or shared, actually shared between humans and animals, lower animals.

03:06.854 --> 03:09.837
And what year did the students take that?

03:10.137 --> 03:12.559
Oh, for a while they taught it.

03:12.579 --> 03:15.542
It took the third year, then it went the first year.

03:16.603 --> 03:17.484
I'm still teaching that.

03:17.524 --> 03:20.046
I teach part of the course now in the third year.

03:20.787 --> 03:23.890
Now, how, when you all went to 96 and then 128 and 132?

03:23.930 --> 03:26.512
Yeah, something like that.

03:26.993 --> 03:32.278
How many sections did you and others have to do then to do with the whole?

03:32.298 --> 03:34.600
Generally, two sections for a long time.

03:34.580 --> 03:40.721
Until we got, either that or we'd be lucky enough we had them over in our 201 where the auditorium sometimes.

03:40.741 --> 03:41.805
So they could do the whole thing?

03:41.865 --> 03:42.387
Yeah, yeah.

03:43.150 --> 03:45.518
In fact, I was stationed over there.

03:47.050 --> 03:55.878
I guess the hour after I taught there is when we had one of the students streak through the classroom and upset the whole school.

03:56.859 --> 03:58.020
Was this a veterinary student?

03:58.040 --> 03:59.181
Did some streaking?

03:59.201 --> 03:59.301
Yeah.

03:59.321 --> 03:59.902
Well, describe that.

04:00.382 --> 04:13.935
Well, I wasn't there, thank goodness, but Don Worsig teaches pharmacology, was teaching, and this kid ran through with a mask on,

04:14.675 --> 04:23.770
for your class and he tried to go catch a student that had these wired microphones and he'd almost jerked his head off.

04:25.893 --> 04:31.142
Anyway, the kid got away and it was hilarious.

04:31.462 --> 04:32.604
He still talks about that.

04:33.065 --> 04:34.567
That got around the school real quick like so.

04:34.707 --> 04:35.989
Then we had to watch the doors.

04:36.390 --> 04:39.535
Probably the worst thing that had happened to me was in that classroom.

04:39.515 --> 04:42.498
Brought his anaconda with him, wrapped around him one day.

04:43.179 --> 04:45.121
I told him, you leave.

04:45.141 --> 04:47.003
You're not going to stay around here, that blasted snake.

04:47.063 --> 04:48.485
So, but that's about the only thing I had.

04:48.505 --> 04:49.646
All right.

04:49.666 --> 04:51.107
So, larger classes.

04:51.368 --> 04:52.209
Right.

04:52.229 --> 04:53.090
Men and women.

04:53.370 --> 04:54.811
Right.

04:57.094 --> 04:59.036
Diverse in terms of race.

05:00.958 --> 05:09.387
How were the students different in the 80s and 90s from those in the 60s?

05:10.312 --> 05:11.434
They were more outspoken.

05:12.555 --> 05:13.537
They were more demanding.

05:15.379 --> 05:23.311
If you gave them the exam and they felt like some of the questions were unfair, they sure let you know very quickly.

05:23.651 --> 05:26.055
And what was your normal response to that?

05:26.075 --> 05:28.619
Normal response, I tell them, I'll look at them, I'll look at them.

05:28.659 --> 05:31.803
If I felt like there's something they should know, I'd say, I'm sorry it stays.

05:33.045 --> 05:37.011
And sometimes it would be that I'd say, well, if you look at it that way, it could be.

05:36.991 --> 05:39.655
You could be writing and I'd give them credit for it.

05:39.675 --> 05:41.738
But they were very, very demanding.

05:42.579 --> 05:49.109
Now if, did you, sometimes you, did you have to do two sections of that same course?

05:49.730 --> 05:50.311
Sometimes.

05:50.371 --> 05:53.396
Generally I was lucky enough where I had one section, but sometimes I'd have two.

05:53.636 --> 05:59.505
And I. And so describe the typical, how many tests?

06:00.727 --> 06:03.471
Generally one for our credits for what I generally.

06:03.451 --> 06:03.993
So.

06:04.234 --> 06:05.419
And final exams, yeah.

06:05.579 --> 06:07.105
Three tests and a final maybe.

06:07.909 --> 06:08.150
Yeah.

06:08.170 --> 06:11.824
All essay?

06:12.682 --> 06:18.111
I gave essays every now and then, and at the time I got through grade, I'd go back to mobile choice.

06:18.131 --> 06:18.852
And then the final?

06:19.313 --> 06:23.260
Final was always a mobile choice, you know, because that time we had to get the grades in very quick.

06:23.420 --> 06:26.726
Yeah, and so they had two or three hours or?

06:27.868 --> 06:32.476
Generally, it was three hours in the final, yes, one hour only.

06:32.496 --> 06:36.242
How did you avoid them having a quiz file?

06:37.083 --> 06:38.705
I didn't.

06:40.167 --> 06:42.109
I just keep trying to change them up.

06:42.129 --> 06:43.411
So you changed every semester?

06:43.431 --> 06:44.652
I tried, yeah.

06:44.672 --> 06:47.636
Now, did you have to grade all the papers or did you have an assistant?

06:47.656 --> 06:49.978
Had to grade them, yeah.

06:49.998 --> 07:03.294
In terms of, still with the quality, looking at the students, in terms of their actual grades before they got to vet school, were the students making higher grades?

07:05.296 --> 07:05.757
Yeah, definitely, yeah.

07:05.737 --> 07:09.282
Were they more urban in their background?

07:09.362 --> 07:10.984
More urban, yes.

07:11.004 --> 07:15.931
As they became more diverse in gender, they became much more urban.

07:16.892 --> 07:19.095
Did it also mean that they knew less about animals?

07:19.496 --> 07:21.158
Yeah, definitely.

07:21.178 --> 07:23.662
Give some examples of their naivete about.

07:23.682 --> 07:26.646
Well, I remember one exam I put on there.

07:27.126 --> 07:30.411
I like to try to use examples of cartoons.

07:30.391 --> 07:32.934
The leghorn, I can't remember his name now.

07:32.954 --> 07:34.696
It used to be a common cartoon.

07:35.857 --> 07:37.619
Anyway, I mentioned a leghorn.

07:38.580 --> 07:47.410
As far as examples, I'd have, let me stop and think, Bugs Bunny, Leggy Leghorn, I think is his name.

07:48.331 --> 07:52.316
Oh gosh, the Moose.

07:53.998 --> 07:54.418
Bullwinkle.

07:54.438 --> 07:55.960
Bullwinkle, they have those down there.

07:56.395 --> 07:57.777
And nobody knew what a lagerin was.

07:58.058 --> 07:59.621
Some of them didn't know what a lagerin was.

07:59.681 --> 08:01.624
They didn't know what a type of chicken was.

08:01.644 --> 08:02.265
A lagerin chicken.

08:02.306 --> 08:03.027
A lagerin chicken.

08:03.548 --> 08:04.570
I still couldn't get over it.

08:04.590 --> 08:05.551
I had several of them complain.

08:05.571 --> 08:06.894
We never heard of a lagerin before.

08:07.274 --> 08:09.478
They didn't know the types of chickens.

08:09.879 --> 08:12.143
That was the most common type.

08:12.123 --> 08:14.969
Were their career goals also different?

08:15.410 --> 08:17.234
Yeah, they're getting much different.

08:17.254 --> 08:28.056
They've become more, I'd say probably the majority by far, small animal, companion animal, a few equine,

08:28.036 --> 08:34.642
or a few mixed practice and a few exotic animals.

08:35.102 --> 08:40.187
And they switched as time goes on more and more that way, yeah.

08:40.687 --> 08:45.932
In terms of where they did their undergraduate degree, was there much change there?

08:46.673 --> 08:48.795
I think more and more of them came from A&M, really.

08:48.815 --> 08:49.435
More from A&M?

08:49.455 --> 08:50.496
I think so, yeah.

08:50.536 --> 08:51.978
That's my impression.

08:52.058 --> 08:54.500
This primary, I think, was a biomedical science program.

08:54.560 --> 08:54.880
Okay.

08:54.900 --> 08:58.043
It made it easier for me to get a pre-vet.

08:58.023 --> 09:03.129
When you first got here, A&M and where else did they come?

09:03.149 --> 09:04.250
A&M, of course, LSU.

09:05.572 --> 09:05.692
Okay.

09:05.712 --> 09:10.738
There's quite a few from, you know, places like Abilene Christian and Arlington.

09:11.119 --> 09:11.419
Tech?

09:11.719 --> 09:12.681
Tech, yeah.

09:12.701 --> 09:13.361
Yeah, quite a few.

09:13.381 --> 09:13.982
Tech, yeah.

09:14.303 --> 09:15.484
Quite a few from various places.

09:16.085 --> 09:17.166
A few of the junior colleges.

09:18.608 --> 09:23.794
I'm trying to think of Stephen F. Austin, a few from there.

09:25.343 --> 09:34.774
And by the 90s, the majority of the veterinary class was female.

09:37.457 --> 09:45.086
Did some of the guys begin to complain that they were being pushed out of the way?

09:45.106 --> 09:47.388
Yeah, yeah, yeah, sure did, yeah.

09:47.409 --> 09:53.916
We've had quite a few girls too from UT also, quite a few, a few from Rice.

09:55.617 --> 09:57.479
All right, now let's go back and do leadership.

09:57.840 --> 09:59.262
Dr. Price retired.

10:00.503 --> 10:00.844
Right.

10:00.864 --> 10:02.486
And he was in good health and all that.

10:02.626 --> 10:03.567
He retired for age.

10:04.609 --> 10:07.552
And do you remember the search for the new dean?

10:07.953 --> 10:08.614
I was on the committee.

10:10.076 --> 10:11.517
Describe that.

10:11.918 --> 10:17.525
The search, it boiled down to, well, I had quite a few candidates.

10:18.867 --> 10:19.428
I think J.D.

10:19.548 --> 10:23.633
McCready is one of them again, or was at that time.

10:24.170 --> 10:29.238
We had a fellow by the name of Don McDonald, not Don McDonald, but Donald from Ohio State.

10:29.699 --> 10:31.742
Remember him?

10:32.543 --> 10:33.205
George Shelton.

10:34.847 --> 10:36.630
The associate dean at Missouri.

10:36.951 --> 10:38.193
Yeah.

10:38.293 --> 10:41.117
Jake Mosier, I think, from Kansas State was in there.

10:41.979 --> 10:43.842
By the way, he's in pretty poor health right now.

10:44.723 --> 10:44.823
Yeah.

10:44.843 --> 10:46.165
Real great, great guy.

10:48.068 --> 10:48.810
I'm trying to think who else.

10:48.830 --> 10:49.671
We had McDonald.

10:52.267 --> 10:54.551
My memory is there were eight interviewees.

10:55.493 --> 10:55.613
Right.

10:55.633 --> 10:57.897
Because yours truly was the chair of the committee.

10:57.917 --> 10:58.378
Yeah, I remember.

10:58.678 --> 11:00.281
And that was my mistake.

11:00.481 --> 11:01.222
Yeah.

11:01.242 --> 11:03.747
But we sent forward two names, didn't we?

11:03.767 --> 11:03.907
Uh-huh.

11:03.927 --> 11:04.749
I mean, George is one.

11:04.869 --> 11:06.151
Was McDonald the other one?

11:06.171 --> 11:06.311
Uh-huh.

11:06.331 --> 11:06.431
Okay.

11:07.273 --> 11:07.373
Yeah.

11:07.724 --> 11:11.770
And, of course, George accepted, thank goodness.

11:13.051 --> 11:18.439
Do you remember how the committee, I mean, how the faculty felt in general about the search, the process?

11:19.660 --> 11:22.304
I thought they were fairly satisfied with it.

11:22.424 --> 11:24.167
I didn't receive any complaints.

11:24.587 --> 11:32.398
Looking back, nothing compared to what followed, but nothing like what followed, I mean, as far as the next search.

11:32.378 --> 11:35.683
This is another editorial note to the typist.

11:37.405 --> 11:49.864
As the chairman of the search committee, I went back to each of the subgroups that interviewed these eight people and asked them to rank

11:51.515 --> 11:55.581
in their order of preference, all of these eight people.

11:56.623 --> 12:04.215
When we tallied that, clearly McDonald and Shelton ranked far higher than any of the others.

12:05.397 --> 12:15.953
I then went to, with the blessing of Vice President John C. Calhoun, went to Dr. Jack Williams, the President, to give him the summary.

12:16.827 --> 12:24.541
And as I described these two, I told him that McDonald would really be exciting.

12:24.901 --> 12:25.643
I used that word.

12:25.663 --> 12:26.464
And he said, what do you mean?

12:27.025 --> 12:32.976
I said some of his ideas will be goofy, but there will be something happening all the time.

12:33.958 --> 12:35.260
There may be controversy.

12:35.340 --> 12:41.451
The faculty may not like him part of the time, but I mean that place will be interesting and it'll be exciting.

12:41.836 --> 12:44.400
He quickly smiled and said, tell me about the other one.

12:45.703 --> 12:48.067
I said, well, Dr. Shelton is calm.

12:48.628 --> 12:49.910
He's kind of low key.

12:49.970 --> 12:54.057
Things will get better gradually, quietly.

12:54.578 --> 13:01.369
He'll work well with the public, well with the professionals out in the field.

13:01.429 --> 13:05.937
And things will just gradually improve.

13:06.710 --> 13:09.657
After hearing that, he said, let's go with Dr. Shelton.

13:09.697 --> 13:12.944
He said, I've got enough damn excitement in my life.

13:12.964 --> 13:15.610
I don't need any more of that.

13:15.630 --> 13:19.940
What do you think was the general reaction of the selection of Dr. Shelton?

13:20.080 --> 13:21.083
I think it was very favorable.

13:21.604 --> 13:22.626
A lot of people

13:22.606 --> 13:27.851
who knew of McDonald and the particular pathology area were really scared of him.

13:27.871 --> 13:29.092
Is that right?

13:29.112 --> 13:29.213
Yeah.

13:29.233 --> 13:35.178
Because one of the things I learned is apparently he literally told them they could take the job and shove it up there.

13:35.439 --> 13:35.539
Yeah.

13:35.559 --> 13:38.342
Because he had gone to Georgia at that time.

13:38.362 --> 13:39.202
Right, yeah.

13:39.222 --> 13:43.687
Describe Dr. Shelton coming and taking over as dean.

13:44.267 --> 13:44.388
Yeah.

13:44.408 --> 13:47.871
Probably when pathology, physiologists, I didn't tell you,

13:49.167 --> 13:59.316
When I was at Oklahoma State, I mean, when I was thinking about coming here, Iowa State, a gentleman called me from the Physiology and Pharmacology Department of Oklahoma State.

13:59.997 --> 14:01.458
That fellow's name was McDonald.

14:01.478 --> 14:03.920
Oh.

14:03.940 --> 14:04.000
OK.

14:04.020 --> 14:05.381
I didn't mention that at all before.

14:05.401 --> 14:06.142
Pardon me.

14:06.162 --> 14:07.323
I mean, when I was on the committee.

14:07.343 --> 14:07.543
Yeah.

14:08.784 --> 14:08.884
Yeah.

14:08.904 --> 14:09.125
Thank you.

14:09.145 --> 14:13.469
Describe Dr. Shelton's arrival and how he started out.

14:13.829 --> 14:15.030
How?

14:15.210 --> 14:16.311
Very, very low key.

14:16.631 --> 14:18.533
He came in and, uh,

14:18.513 --> 14:24.287
It wasn't all exciting like it would have been maybe.

14:25.702 --> 14:29.346
I remember he asked, we all were anxious of what he was going to do.

14:29.406 --> 14:35.152
He asked to meet all department heads and he talked with them about what he wanted them to do.

14:36.233 --> 14:51.709
I don't think he asked for any resignations at that time, but he did, he was concerned I know, at least I feel like he was, about some of the department heads and because they'd been in that position for many years and there needed to be some changes, but he was very

14:53.680 --> 15:04.413
Very fair handed I thought when he came in and well received except some department heads were very concerned about their long tenure maybe coming to an end soon and it did, yeah.

15:05.955 --> 15:12.003
And who did he create, was there an associate dean?

15:12.443 --> 15:15.086
Yes, he created an associate dean and that did cause a little problems.

15:15.126 --> 15:20.413
He brought in a fellow from Missouri, didn't he?

15:22.537 --> 15:23.278
No, he didn't.

15:23.298 --> 15:26.563
The associate dean was Wally Bay, I think.

15:26.864 --> 15:26.984
Wally?

15:27.004 --> 15:30.389
Yeah, he brought Wally Bay who became associate dean.

15:30.409 --> 15:37.520
He did bring in Bill McCullough from Missouri was with him up there in to the school.

15:38.562 --> 15:45.152
He brought Ray Lone down.

15:45.132 --> 15:47.856
There was something concerned about he was bringing in the Missouri Mafia.

15:49.518 --> 15:56.708
So from that standpoint, that was the only concern I heard expressed about who he was bringing in, yeah.

15:57.149 --> 16:01.835
And once these people got here and things got in place?

16:02.416 --> 16:03.317
They went pretty well.

16:03.337 --> 16:04.419
Sure did, yeah, yeah.

16:04.439 --> 16:05.080
Really did, yeah.

16:05.741 --> 16:12.490
And by this time, how would you, what do you think would have been the general national

16:12.993 --> 16:16.798
ranking that the A&M College of Veterinary Medicine would have gotten?

16:18.080 --> 16:19.882
By the time when he came in, ranking?

16:23.346 --> 16:24.808
Probably in the mid-range, I guess.

16:24.828 --> 16:25.810
All right.

16:26.130 --> 16:28.133
And he's here about 10 years.

16:28.173 --> 16:30.075
No, no, 14 years.

16:30.095 --> 16:31.317
14 years, yeah.

16:31.337 --> 16:32.959
And then when he leaves,

16:33.901 --> 16:35.525
I think we're in the top three or four.

16:36.106 --> 16:37.108
That's just my impression.

16:37.308 --> 16:43.021
Do you think that part of the credit for that goes back to those years?

16:43.262 --> 16:44.043
I think so, yes.

16:44.224 --> 16:44.645
I sure do.

16:44.665 --> 16:45.527
I sure do.

16:46.188 --> 16:49.395
What was his management style, personally?

16:49.375 --> 16:53.801
His management style, I don't know the technical names for it, Haskell.

16:54.201 --> 17:03.294
He was, he's one that would listen, very, very, I thought very fair, very steady, even-handed.

17:03.915 --> 17:15.350
He may have been a little bit more tolerant, more patient than some of us would want him to be, but he didn't have a knee-jerk reaction type on the thing.

17:15.370 --> 17:18.454
He's very, very deliberate, very,

17:19.008 --> 17:21.834
try to be persuasive to get people to change the way they do things.

17:21.894 --> 17:23.597
If they could, well, then he would replace them.

17:23.737 --> 17:26.543
But he didn't do it just overnight, if that makes sense.

17:26.863 --> 17:30.871
And did he work well out with the professional?

17:30.971 --> 17:32.053
Yes, he did, yeah.

17:32.214 --> 17:33.015
All across the city?

17:33.376 --> 17:33.837
Yeah, he did.

17:34.117 --> 17:39.548
How did you all think he related to the campus administration?

17:39.528 --> 17:41.711
I thought he did very well.

17:41.771 --> 17:43.873
I've never heard any problems with him.

17:44.834 --> 17:46.677
I thought that he fared quite well.

17:47.338 --> 17:52.724
I think that he was looked upon in my days in the 70s quite well.

17:53.505 --> 17:55.227
Also mention his wife.

17:55.708 --> 18:00.413
His wife is very lovely but a character.

18:01.615 --> 18:07.442
She is a very rabid sports fan, very rabid Aggie.

18:08.097 --> 18:14.285
She, you could see both of them at a basketball game or a football game and she'd be shouting and he'd be sitting there just calm as could be.

18:17.990 --> 18:23.898
During the Shelton years, you were in what department?

18:23.918 --> 18:25.320
I was in Veterinary Public Health.

18:25.560 --> 18:27.322
Veterinary Public Health and the chairman?

18:27.763 --> 18:32.569
Was Archie Flyers to begin with and he retired in Armand Heideball.

18:32.802 --> 18:33.423
Take his place.

18:34.085 --> 18:36.951
And I used the word chairman, or should I have said head?

18:37.151 --> 18:37.632
Head.

18:37.652 --> 18:38.233
Department head.

18:38.293 --> 18:38.875
Head, yes.

18:38.895 --> 18:47.933
Now, during all of these years, the process in the College of Veterinary Medicine, the department head made decisions.

18:47.953 --> 18:48.735
Right, yeah.

18:49.087 --> 18:51.532
And you all didn't operate as a democracy?

18:51.552 --> 18:52.194
No, no.

18:52.775 --> 18:52.875
Okay.

18:52.895 --> 18:53.757
It's a dictatorship.

18:54.860 --> 18:58.568
And when did you make full professor?

18:58.588 --> 18:58.929
Do you remember?

18:59.370 --> 19:00.833
In 75, I think.

19:00.853 --> 19:01.595
75, all right.

19:01.615 --> 19:03.760
So you've been?

19:04.060 --> 19:05.323
Yeah, I think.

19:06.080 --> 19:06.821
I think so, yeah.

19:06.841 --> 19:08.844
So you've been a department head for 25 years.

19:08.864 --> 19:10.467
I mean a professor, yeah.

19:10.527 --> 19:11.769
I mean a professor.

19:11.789 --> 19:12.850
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

19:12.870 --> 19:13.331
I think 75.

19:13.491 --> 19:19.420
And you continued to become active in the AVMA.

19:19.561 --> 19:20.602
Right.

19:21.163 --> 19:25.550
When did you decide you wanted to become a national officer?

19:27.733 --> 19:30.417
I don't think I ever did.

19:32.152 --> 19:35.056
Really, it goes back to George Shelton.

19:37.439 --> 19:40.243
They were having some problems, apparently, communicating.

19:42.746 --> 19:46.731
They asked the College of Veterinary Medicine with the Texas Veterinary Medical Association.

19:48.053 --> 19:54.121
And Worley Bay came to me one day and asked me, would you run for vice president of the TVMA?

19:54.141 --> 19:59.288
TVMA has three vice presidents, third, second, first, and then president-elect president.

19:59.308 --> 20:00.690
And they more or less go up the chain.

20:01.345 --> 20:02.666
And I told him, no, no way.

20:03.747 --> 20:06.650
He came back and I found out later, of course, George was behind it.

20:07.191 --> 20:09.213
I said, well, would you just consider trying it?

20:09.433 --> 20:10.694
I said, well, there's no way I could win.

20:11.315 --> 20:22.126
And meantime, I found out a friend of mine who I knew very well, former student, they graduated about 70, was running that position too.

20:22.146 --> 20:23.227
I said, sure, I'll run.

20:23.547 --> 20:29.293
Knowing there's no way in hell I'm going to win, I probably shouldn't say that, but I'm going to win.

20:29.273 --> 20:30.795
I don't know what happened, but I won.

20:31.355 --> 20:34.599
And therefore, I was on the track to go ahead.

20:35.460 --> 20:39.905
And so I went through up the chairs and became president, what have you.

20:40.827 --> 20:48.415
And then we have, in the AVMA, we have what we call an executive board, an executive board by districts, three states, Texas, Louisiana, and Arkansas.

20:48.976 --> 20:51.579
Al Hopkins was stepping down from his executive board.

20:51.619 --> 20:53.722
I mean, he'd been there for a six-year term.

20:53.742 --> 20:55.804
He'd run for president-elect.

20:55.784 --> 21:02.533
and of AVMA, and anyway, just thought I should be, should run for that position.

21:02.613 --> 21:09.722
I did and won, and after I went through that, and as chairman of the executive board, I decided I didn't want to run.

21:09.802 --> 21:18.012
Well, I got word, but you know, Texas wants another president, so George was gone then, I mean, by that time.

21:18.633 --> 21:20.618
The current dean says, no, I don't want you to run.

21:20.638 --> 21:21.199
I said, fine.

21:21.239 --> 21:29.959
Well, I soon got word that the TVMA got word to her administration here.

21:30.380 --> 21:33.227
Anyway, the dean came to me and said, well, I've changed my mind.

21:35.091 --> 21:37.637
So I ran.

21:38.461 --> 21:42.249
I told Martha, you know, that's three years out of her life if they want me to run out well.

21:42.289 --> 21:44.053
So it's a matter of George started it all.

21:44.374 --> 21:47.841
And one president at AVMA, I called him and said, can I quit now?

21:49.766 --> 21:49.986
So.

21:50.628 --> 21:54.075
And you served, when was it?

21:54.095 --> 21:56.841
94, 93, 94 as president.

21:56.821 --> 21:57.642
Right.

21:57.662 --> 22:03.469
And you and how many of your classmates from Missouri?

22:03.590 --> 22:05.512
One other, Gerald Johnson.

22:05.752 --> 22:06.413
Yeah.

22:06.513 --> 22:08.135
He was nine, he was two years before me.

22:08.736 --> 22:11.359
And so two out of a class of how many?

22:11.800 --> 22:14.463
Twenty, twenty-six, yeah.

22:14.483 --> 22:15.124
Two.

22:15.144 --> 22:15.244
Okay.

22:15.264 --> 22:19.369
And that's, I think that's the only classmates that have been to the president.

22:19.470 --> 22:22.353
This is another editorial note.

22:23.194 --> 22:25.377
At about this time,

22:25.357 --> 22:38.742
member of the governing board at the University of Missouri, who is the primary owner of the Adams Mark Hotels nationwide,

22:39.734 --> 22:54.628
Wise got very cynical at a board meeting of the University of Missouri System and he said that veterinarians were nothing but a bunch of poodle groomers.

22:54.688 --> 23:00.274
Why in the world would we waste money on such a useless program as that?

23:01.655 --> 23:05.539
And I went up to him to try to tell him that we had

23:06.228 --> 23:26.498
We had these two people, plus we had a Miss America, Debbie Turner, who had come out of the vet school, and in the long run, his flagrant use of bad judgment was one of the best things that ever happened to the College of Veterinary Medicine at the University of Missouri.

23:26.478 --> 23:33.230
because every veterinarian in the state got very energetic and exercised and he heard a heck of a lot about.

23:33.911 --> 23:38.099
And as a result of that, the vet school became stronger than it ever had been.

23:39.682 --> 23:42.547
Describe the duties of being president of the AVMA.

23:43.048 --> 23:45.152
President of the AVMA, you're the spokesperson for them.

23:45.693 --> 23:47.997
You're not only the executive board, but you

23:48.297 --> 23:51.965
You carry the word out to all the constituents as well as possible.

23:52.025 --> 23:54.189
What's going on, it's a two-way street.

23:54.209 --> 23:56.454
Try to find out what needs to be done by the association.

23:57.596 --> 23:59.700
At that time, there were 60,000 members.

23:59.821 --> 24:08.719
About 85% of the veterinarians in this country are members of AVMA, which is about twice the percentage of the AMA physicians, which is kind of surprising.

24:08.699 --> 24:11.844
Twice the percentage of professionals or members?

24:11.964 --> 24:18.114
Yeah, about 40, 45 percent last I heard of physicians, MDs or members of the American Medical Association.

24:18.134 --> 24:19.276
We got about 85 percent.

24:19.296 --> 24:22.100
So it is well represented in the profession.

24:22.160 --> 24:27.148
But the duties of the president is to be the spokesperson.

24:27.729 --> 24:36.242
And we went to 48 states and about eight foreign countries to speak their meetings.

24:36.222 --> 24:38.126
Which two states did you know?

24:38.146 --> 24:40.330
Did not make Vermont nor Alaska.

24:41.011 --> 24:46.622
They changed the meeting date of when Alaska and I, it was August and June, they changed to September.

24:46.642 --> 24:52.594
My term goes from July to July and so I missed it because the,

24:53.300 --> 24:56.305
Did you have any lobbying, any federal?

24:56.506 --> 24:57.066
Yes, yes.

24:57.087 --> 24:57.988
What were some of the?

24:58.008 --> 25:09.047
We, at that time, we were trying to get past a, we, AVMA had introduced a law, pardon me, a bill to make it legal for veterinarians to

25:09.027 --> 25:13.958
utilize extra label drugs.

25:14.619 --> 25:15.120
Extra label?

25:15.140 --> 25:15.501
Extra label.

25:15.842 --> 25:23.458
In other words, the only, according to the law, the only drugs could be used, medications could be used on animals were those for which they were licensed and labeled for.

25:23.618 --> 25:27.627
For example, if you had something licensed for use on a dog, or say for a cow,

25:27.944 --> 25:35.834
For respiratory disease you can use that same drug for gastrointestinal disease nor could you use it on sheep or something else even though they're very similar.

25:36.735 --> 25:39.138
So we call this MDUCA.

25:40.700 --> 25:53.817
It's really to allow veterinarians to use their professional judgment to use licensed drugs for other animal species on different animal species and that includes human drugs because many of them are tested on animals like dogs and you can use those drugs in on animals.

25:53.797 --> 25:55.759
So we had to get a bill introduced to Congress.

25:55.779 --> 25:56.720
We had to get that bill passed.

25:56.760 --> 26:00.764
So I spent most of my time, or a lot of my time during that year in Washington, D.C.

26:01.425 --> 26:10.014
We had one very good sponsor in this House of Representatives, Charlie Stenholm, and he was, I really have the greatest respect for that guy.

26:10.034 --> 26:12.116
He would come off the floor to talk to us when we'd be there.

26:12.176 --> 26:17.502
He would lean the word backwards trying to listen to us, and he was very supportive.

26:18.583 --> 26:19.323
And it did pass.

26:19.343 --> 26:19.884
It did pass.

26:19.944 --> 26:20.385
It passed.

26:20.585 --> 26:21.846
We worked on it for a year.

26:22.400 --> 26:24.104
It cost a little over a million dollars.

26:24.424 --> 26:27.932
My main and a half time was all done just to get everything done.

26:29.476 --> 26:34.587
I got to say a lot of the... Where did the opposition come from?

26:35.090 --> 26:37.634
Primarily, people didn't want it to change.

26:38.515 --> 26:42.121
And I guess our main opposition was Henry Waxman in the House.

26:42.622 --> 26:53.940
And we thought for a while it was Ted Kennedy in the Senate, but we had a what we call a congressional fellow who was working on his staff, and he finally convinced Ted Kennedy that was a good thing.

26:54.020 --> 27:01.772
So it was a matter of people had the idea, well, you're going to have more drug residues than animals because you're using these drugs that hadn't been approved of those animals.

27:01.752 --> 27:03.775
The veteran has to use his judgment.

27:03.875 --> 27:08.543
And if you look at it, there'd be more healthy animals going to slaughter than there would be sick animals.

27:08.563 --> 27:11.368
Because if you get to treat them, you're going to send them to slaughter, the farmers or the ranchers.

27:11.408 --> 27:14.853
So it's a matter of just not understanding what it was all about.

27:15.434 --> 27:23.407
Now I'm assuming that the most difficult part of that task was simply the days and hours demanded.

27:23.687 --> 27:24.589
Right, it was.

27:25.190 --> 27:28.435
What were some of the other difficulties you had to...

27:29.005 --> 27:52.060
to deal with that you know you mean for that drug issue or no no no and being president oh uh there was always something uh for example one of the the feed companies dog food companies came out with a a coupon on the box sack whatever the container was that if they take this to the veterinarian they'll get a five dollar discount on their veterinary fee well there's no

27:52.040 --> 27:54.048
agreement with that type of thing at all.

27:54.289 --> 27:56.377
And I got hit with that when I was in New Jersey.

27:56.398 --> 28:01.257
I remember going to New Jersey meeting and saying, what's this stuff about us having to honor these coupons?

28:01.591 --> 28:02.973
That type of thing.

28:06.739 --> 28:08.422
That was one thing.

28:09.243 --> 28:10.786
I'm trying to think of other things.

28:12.528 --> 28:27.953
One of the things I was doing when I wasn't doing that, invariably when you go, I remember I had to go to Louisville and you'd have to go to TV stations, the radio stations to be interviewed and one thing I was pushing was responsible pet ownership.

28:27.933 --> 28:33.426
particularly around Christmas time, so don't just buy a pet because it looks cute, that dog in the window syndrome.

28:33.847 --> 28:42.065
You must, first of all, check with a veterinarian or somebody who knows how big that dog's going to be, what kind of housing he must have, what kind of care he must have.

28:42.426 --> 28:45.874
You don't need a Labrador if you've got an apartment, this type of thing.

28:45.854 --> 28:47.937
So that was one of the things I was doing.

28:48.037 --> 28:54.047
I remember I went to an interview in Louisville, Kentucky, the TV station there, and I sat outside.

28:54.067 --> 28:57.071
You generally like to talk to people ahead of time, but I didn't talk to anybody.

28:57.111 --> 29:00.557
They just called me in about five minutes before they went live.

29:01.198 --> 29:06.125
I said, we just want to talk to you a little bit, and I had this lady at the far end, the man in the center, and I'm sitting there.

29:06.145 --> 29:07.167
She says, what's DVM?

29:07.427 --> 29:07.988
What's that mean?

29:09.731 --> 29:10.873
I said, that means doctor of veterinary medicine.

29:11.073 --> 29:11.854
Is that a veterinarian?

29:11.874 --> 29:12.535
Yeah, what do you do?

29:12.575 --> 29:13.617
What's a veterinarian do?

29:13.985 --> 29:15.608
And by that time, they said, you're on.

29:17.110 --> 29:25.062
So that was kind of a traumatic way to begin a show when the lady there didn't know what a veterinarian was or what kind of education you had.

29:25.082 --> 29:26.925
You asked also what kind of education you had to do that.

29:27.807 --> 29:34.818
And I was trying to educate her as well as give my message about responsible pet ownership across.

29:35.379 --> 29:36.460
So those kind of things you run into.

29:36.901 --> 29:39.325
On the other hand, what were some of the joyful moments?

29:39.826 --> 29:40.467
Joyful moments.

29:40.547 --> 29:41.308
Oh, gosh.

29:41.609 --> 29:51.825
Well, wherever you went, you appreciate that in academia or wherever you go, you meet people, friends in the profession.

29:53.167 --> 29:55.391
But most of all, I guess, meet Aggies regardless of where I went.

29:55.972 --> 30:00.659
I remember we went to Maine Union, New Hampshire, Concord, New Hampshire, and we had to fly into Boston.

30:00.699 --> 30:02.943
The snow was up, you know, about three feet deep.

30:03.383 --> 30:07.650
We had to drive, almost break a trail to get there.

30:08.103 --> 30:13.252
Little small motel where they had the meeting, about just a few minutes before the meeting time we got there.

30:14.234 --> 30:21.666
And by the way, we had flown from Kansas City, but that's the last time we saw Jerry Johnson that day, and I kind of remember it that way.

30:22.247 --> 30:25.072
But anyway, I got this meeting, and I said, there's not going to be anybody here.

30:25.092 --> 30:30.702
A few people came in, and this one student, one fellow came in, and it was one of our Aggies.

30:31.036 --> 30:35.161
He'd gone in the service, he met a girl up there, he married, and he stayed there.

30:35.622 --> 30:37.725
And gosh, I remembered him.

30:38.566 --> 30:40.608
That type of thing was great, but gosh where he went.

30:41.549 --> 30:48.018
I was meeting in France, and this one lady came up and put her arms around me and hugged me.

30:48.038 --> 30:49.179
It was one of the former students.

30:49.419 --> 30:54.786
She got married, moved to France, practicing over there, and she hadn't seen anybody from A&M for years.

30:55.167 --> 30:57.470
Just things like that, that was nice things.

30:57.610 --> 31:00.013
Did you get to meet any true celebrities?

30:59.993 --> 31:03.358
Yeah, a few.

31:05.281 --> 31:05.982
Gosh, what's his name?

31:06.022 --> 31:10.989
The fellow that takes care of the animals in the zoo at Columbusville.

31:11.449 --> 31:12.130
Oh, that's St.

31:12.190 --> 31:12.411
Louis?

31:12.431 --> 31:12.531
Yeah.

31:12.751 --> 31:14.954
Used to have the TV program?

31:14.974 --> 31:15.195
Yeah.

31:15.936 --> 31:19.921
When I was president, we have our convention, we have our big program.

31:20.362 --> 31:28.093
Well, he was there to show some of his animals, and I got to talk with him, and I led the chimpanzee at one hand,

31:28.073 --> 31:31.137
And then he put it over my arms, and I held his chimpanzee.

31:31.178 --> 31:31.722
What's his name?
