WEBVTT

00:03.288 --> 00:18.167
Okay, this is January 8th, 1981, and Eric and I are, 
me as Bob Cornish, we are in the office of Kevin

00:03.288 --> 00:18.167
Stowers at St. Edward's University in Austin, 
Texas. Kevin is in charge of environmental

00:19.008 --> 00:31.624
studies at St. Edward's, and he has been in Austin 
for two and a half years, subsequent to having

00:19.008 --> 00:31.624
taught at Utah State. for five years and before 
that he was the assistant planning director in

00:31.604 --> 00:59.755
Galveston which brings us to the point of this 
interview we would like to ask you Kevin to give us

00:31.604 --> 00:59.755
the benefit of your understanding and knowledge 
about Galveston first and secondly would you like

00:31.604 --> 00:59.755
to just take a look at these questions we've 
provided for you One thing that I think that I need

00:59.735 --> 01:21.355
to say about Galveston particularly that a lot of 
people don't realize is that the historical

00:59.735 --> 01:21.355
records of Galveston and particularly municipal 
records in many cases are very poor and this is

00:59.735 --> 01:21.355
because every time there's a major hurricane, a 
number of records are lost. The records are

01:21.335 --> 01:23.418
damaged. The historical tradition in Galveston 
has been records are damaged. They're simply

01:27.383 --> 01:31.528
carted out and hauled away rather than trying to be 
preserved. This includes city council minutes,

01:31.548 --> 01:38.197
ordinances, whatever. And of course, after each 
disaster, there is a massive renovation and major

01:38.718 --> 01:44.506
changes are made. So... Can we stop one minute? 
Sure. Of course, all of you know historically

01:50.208 --> 02:00.429
after the 1900 hurricane, which was a massive 
disaster that leveled the town completely. There

02:00.449 --> 02:02.633
were almost no buildings left standing. They were 
undamaged. uh the outcome of that was they founded

02:04.653 --> 02:24.838
a commission form of government which is one of 
those rather strange little devices that you kind

02:04.653 --> 02:24.838
of learn about that continued on for some time 
we're going to be busy for a while okay and um the

02:04.653 --> 02:24.838
outcome of that is that they continued under a 
commission form of government for quite some

02:25.477 --> 02:30.564
period of time. I don't know when officially they 
moved from that commission form of government,

02:31.185 --> 02:42.942
but in 1961 a new civic charter was adopted which 
set up a city manager form of government. That is

02:42.962 --> 02:53.357
what I would consider to be the time of new modern 
planning, new modern administration in the city

02:42.962 --> 02:53.357
of Galveston. The 61 Charter was also a response to 
a disaster. They had a hurricane in 61. And so, you

03:01.716 --> 03:03.560
know, what do we do? We have an opportunity for a 
major change. There would have been the usual

03:06.067 --> 03:09.555
problems with the commission form of government. 
And at that stage in 61, They established a whole

03:12.035 --> 03:25.934
series of citizen commissions, among which was 
the Planning Commission, a Traffic Commission, a

03:12.035 --> 03:25.934
Transportation Commission, and so forth and so 
on. This apparently became the backbone and basis

03:25.954 --> 03:32.743
for modern planning efforts in the city of 
Galveston. And I really cannot speak very well for

03:33.145 --> 03:40.442
what happened prior to that, because again, the 
records were thrown out in 61. They got wet, and a

03:40.782 --> 03:45.433
lot of them just simply got carried off. Also, 
there's a tremendous storage problem. City Hall

03:48.161 --> 03:51.708
is an older one, and they run out of space. And it 
seems like with a lot of communities, nobody holds

03:51.988 --> 03:55.876
these old records. You can't give them away. And so 
if you're left with the prospect of continuing

03:57.479 --> 04:03.490
your municipal operations, are ceasing them to 
become an archive, most communities quite

04:03.993 --> 04:11.782
naturally find a dumpster somewhere and get rid of 
these things. And it helps when you get them wet and

04:11.802 --> 04:15.927
they're damaged and they're going to deteriorate 
anyway. That just spurs the movement on. So

04:17.769 --> 04:22.935
Galveston, I think, is going to be a difficult 
community to study in that sense. The first modern

04:22.955 --> 04:30.304
plan, which I managed to figure out, is a Marvin 
Springer. document, or the one that they were

04:30.537 --> 04:40.581
operating under when I was there in 1973, 
comprehensive plan in Port City of Galveston.

04:41.168 --> 04:43.732
I don't know what they had prior to that. I somewhat 
have a feeling, especially by what I saw sitting in

04:44.473 --> 05:05.505
the planning offices in the storage room for the 
drafting department, they were tending to

04:44.473 --> 05:05.505
operate off a poster board and had never really, 
you know, gone through a unified document

04:44.473 --> 05:05.505
procedure up until that point. and these things 
take time, so I don't know that 12 years later seems

05:05.485 --> 05:23.508
like a long time to students, but on the other hand, 
in reality, getting a plan adopted 12 years after

05:05.485 --> 05:23.508
you initiate the process and procedures, that's 
not too bad. I don't have the zoning ordinance. I

05:25.070 --> 05:30.177
loaned it to a colleague who hasn't returned it, 
and If I recall correctly, the zoning ordinance

05:31.118 --> 05:53.110
was adopted in either 64 or 67 that they're 
operating under, which was probably prior to the

05:31.118 --> 05:53.110
Marvin Spranger plant, but it may have well been 
based upon documents that had been adopted in a

05:31.118 --> 05:53.110
more casual attitude and atmosphere for this 
plant.

05:56.735 --> 06:01.822
Is there any periodic review of the Springer plan? 
Well, when I was there, yes. Now, of course,

06:04.205 --> 06:20.729
there's a distinction between what a periodic 
review in terms of citizen input hearings, you

06:04.205 --> 06:20.729
know, a formal readoption by the city council, and 
what the staffs do. I think inevitably the staffs

06:20.849 --> 06:23.232
are always reviewing and updating these 
documents. There's nothing else simply to keep

06:25.035 --> 06:31.384
their engineering data, their population data, 
their housing data up to date. Furthermore, it's

06:31.504 --> 06:37.953
almost required that the data be updated simply in 
terms of grant applications. And this was

06:38.333 --> 06:42.179
something we were pursuing very hard when I was in 
Galveston. We took the city from If I remember my

06:43.681 --> 06:52.817
figures right, I had one year from $150,000 in 
federal grants to something like $1.4 million.

06:53.378 --> 07:01.892
When you do that, that involves massive inputs in 
terms of document review and updating.

07:02.969 --> 07:08.615
The systematic review of the document, when I was 
there, it was a very modern document. It was only a

07:08.635 --> 07:09.296
year or two old. And so therefore, we had not gone 
through a five year review. It's my understanding

07:13.720 --> 07:28.656
that the document is probably, from what I've 
judged just reading and talking to a couple

07:13.720 --> 07:28.656
people, has been reviewed in a very serious way in 
the last year or two, but I would have to check with

07:13.720 --> 07:28.656
my people in Galveston to find that out for sure.

07:35.960 --> 07:52.991
What administrative

07:35.960 --> 07:52.991
procedures and planning program elements does 
Galveston have for implementing community

07:35.960 --> 07:52.991
plans? At the present, I don't know. They've got a 
planning department, I know that.

08:01.373 --> 08:03.055
What about the manager's role? I mean, that seems 
to have... Well, Galveston's been hard on

08:03.075 --> 08:07.781
managers. As a matter of fact, good managers 
frequently find other things to do in Galveston

08:08.842 --> 08:17.933
within two or three years. Most managers do not 
last very long in Galveston because they're

08:17.953 --> 08:26.885
either competent and good and move on to better 
things that are offered to them or else they're

08:17.953 --> 08:26.885
fired. Why does this happen, Kevin, would you say? 
I mean, clearly the council's fault here. Oh,

08:31.833 --> 08:39.142
well, the council is certainly a representative 
of the community and it represents that

08:31.833 --> 08:39.142
cross-section in a very interesting manner. If 
you look at Galveston, it's probably one of the

08:39.643 --> 08:44.729
most diverse communities in the state of Texas. As 
a matter of fact, when they looked at segregation

08:45.350 --> 08:55.242
patterns, Galveston was listed as being one of the 
most integrated cities in the United States in the

08:45.350 --> 08:55.242
early 1960s. Well, in reality, those people are 
not dealing with each other in terms of social

08:55.222 --> 09:00.429
aspect. It's just such an old city that's so 
compact and so many uses of land mixed together

09:00.449 --> 09:19.997
that you can have part of a block being black, part 
of it being white, and part being

09:00.449 --> 09:19.997
Spanish-American without those people ever 
really interacting and to say hello and nice to see

09:00.449 --> 09:19.997
you. And this is one of the essential characters of 
Galveston. It's a very compact, small island.

09:28.369 --> 09:31.473
Also, there's a tremendous amount of wealth in 
Galveston. Historically, it was the premier city

09:31.493 --> 09:39.405
in the state of Texas until the 1900 storm, and 
there's tremendous wealth there today. There is

09:39.925 --> 09:44.652
also perhaps some of the most acute poverty 
problems that you will ever see. When I was there,

09:44.632 --> 09:53.723
the median education level for adults over the age 
of 25, if I remember my statistics correctly, was

09:44.632 --> 09:53.723
eighth grade. But it's got the University of Texas 
Medical Branch there. It's got a junior college.

09:59.129 --> 10:03.515
They've got a lot of major corporations and 
headquarters there, financial institutions.

10:03.855 --> 10:09.982
Yet, you know, here you have a very poorly educated 
and functioning- You don't want to forget Texas

10:03.855 --> 10:09.982
A&M's campus. Oh, no. I'm sorry. I keep forgetting 
about them. It's hard to forget them. They keep

10:21.781 --> 10:25.508
changing their mind what kind of sign they want. As 
a result, the traffic people told them where they

10:26.369 --> 10:35.125
could go with their sign and that sign was not going 
to be changed again as long as there was a city of

10:26.369 --> 10:35.125
Galveston. They had a name change recently, you 
know. Yeah, well this was actually before that.

10:39.832 --> 10:53.693
They kept trying to decide, you know, they wanted 
to be capitals in which part of the school they

10:39.832 --> 10:53.693
wanted to emphasize and, you know, what should 
come first and on the side and, you know, so it got to

10:39.832 --> 10:53.693
be the point it was kind of ridiculous. We keep 
trying to get changes every six months to a year. It

10:56.657 --> 10:57.719
gets expensive. That doesn't sound difficult, 
does it? No, no. Things have changed. But

11:04.349 --> 11:09.516
Galveston is a very diverse community, and 
there's a lot of conflicts. Also, it's got a

11:10.297 --> 11:13.461
tremendously sensitive environment. Before we 
leave this point, though, I think it's

11:13.622 --> 11:29.243
particularly critical of Galveston, from my 
understanding, because they've gone through

11:13.622 --> 11:29.243
umpteen city managers and planning directors and 
planning staffs, and I think that we ought to

11:32.564 --> 11:49.410
The

11:32.564 --> 11:49.410
gentleman

11:32.564 --> 11:49.410
that was there prior to my venue, which would be the 
late 60s, early 70s, tried to undertake an urban

11:32.564 --> 11:49.410
renewal program. I don't remember the guy's name. 
He went to Mississippi. There's a great movement

11:54.552 --> 12:05.412
along the coast, the southern coast of planter 
directors that are moving to other similar

11:54.552 --> 12:05.412
communities from their previous occupation. 
Like Bruce. Yes. And the outcome was that There was

12:12.305 --> 12:20.899
a lot of animosity created because Galveston 
being a compact city, there's no way you can really

12:12.305 --> 12:20.899
do anything without tearing something down. And 
of course everybody knows what's going to be torn

12:21.700 --> 12:27.630
down and there was a lot of real conservative 
feeling politically in this period. He was not

12:33.929 --> 12:43.729
successful in the referendum and getting the 
urban renewal projects, programs pushed through

12:33.929 --> 12:43.729
and accepted by the community.

12:44.300 --> 12:55.923
He got little things like one-way airplane 
tickets back to his home on the east coast in the

12:44.300 --> 12:55.923
mail, which he promptly cashed in and threw a party 
with for the staff. Somebody mailed that? Oh yes,

12:58.929 --> 13:02.275
anonymously.

13:03.014 --> 13:07.182
So there was a good feeling of animosity. At that 
point, there was a lot of reorganization. There

13:09.968 --> 13:14.237
was a feeling that Galveston was not getting its 
due, that things needed to be done. And certain

13:14.918 --> 13:24.297
progressive elements in the community, and you 
can call them progressive or renegade or radical,

13:14.918 --> 13:24.297
depending on what your view is, happened to me. 
Well, the Moody Foundation, interestingly

13:24.850 --> 13:37.066
enough, does like to see certain things done and is 
a very powerful force in Galveston.

13:37.126 --> 13:40.151
Mrs. Northern is quite a force. If you want to know 
which religion to undertake, just see where she

13:40.231 --> 13:45.157
puts her money and go accordingly. They may be 
interested in funding the continuation of this

13:45.398 --> 13:50.665
project. Yeah. Well, that's good. They are 
interested in those types of things. That's the

13:55.774 --> 13:57.657
kind of project they would fund. They would fund 
libraries, cultural centers, historical

13:57.717 --> 14:03.647
renovation, things of this nature. It's very 
positive educational ventures, religious

14:03.927 --> 14:08.595
ventures. They are a powerful force within 
Galveston, and particularly But beyond that,

14:15.188 --> 14:20.015
there was a lot of feeling that Galveston was not 
going anywhere. It was being passed by. It hadn't

14:21.578 --> 14:35.659
grown between 50 and 60, and the hurricane had 
whopped it, and the 1970 census came out, and it

14:21.578 --> 14:35.659
lost a little bit of population, and there was a lot 
of concern about where Galveston was going to be in

14:21.578 --> 14:35.659
the future. There's this old syndrome that if 
you're not growing, there's something somehow

14:35.679 --> 14:41.027
unhealthy about you as a community. And you have a 
lot

14:41.817 --> 14:52.092
of business interests in the community. Excuse 
me. The house. Shook hands with all of you before I

14:52.713 --> 14:55.477
told you. Oh, a little bit of illness in the house, 
so I shook hands with all of you before I mentioned

14:55.497 --> 15:00.404
it. Eric looks happy. But, oh, just a stomach bug, 
cramps. Probably the flu. Yes, something. I'm not

15:09.878 --> 15:11.200
sure what the symptoms of that. But

15:13.087 --> 15:22.681
Galveston has this real concern over where it's 
going in the future, and it didn't seem to be going

15:13.087 --> 15:22.681
much of anywhere. It seemed to be the same old 
place. There was not a lot of new investment, a lot

15:24.664 --> 15:32.395
of people moving in, and it was very difficult to 
get things done. At this stage, they hired a

15:32.881 --> 15:45.557
community development director, Dean Mayberry, 
spelled without a Y, M-A-B-E-R-R-Y.

15:46.145 --> 15:56.536
out of Hartford, Connecticut, and he had been at 
Hartford and New Haven running their programs up

15:46.145 --> 15:56.536
there and had done some really dynamite things. 
They had had a position open for some time and they

15:57.717 --> 16:15.156
just couldn't get anybody hired and they 
contacted him because he was very experienced in

15:57.717 --> 16:15.156
taking older cities that seemed to be kind of 
stabilizing and stagnating and turning things

15:57.717 --> 16:15.156
around and getting things happening. uh he came in 
and they took the city traffic engineer and made

16:16.267 --> 16:37.870
him planning director and consolidated planning 
and traffic engineering transportation which in

16:16.267 --> 16:37.870
some ways actually makes some sense although I 
wouldn't I would have chosen myself to be director

16:16.267 --> 16:37.870
but I wasn't there at the time But it does make some 
sense, and they put planning and traffic under the

16:39.098 --> 16:46.386
Community Development Department. They gave 
them systematic and concentrated code

16:46.987 --> 16:55.816
enforcement, which are two federal programs that 
have been undergoing, and were very unsuccessful

16:46.987 --> 16:55.816
at getting much done. You know, it seemed like you 
get a loan application and it sits there three

16:56.116 --> 17:07.789
years later, you know, or every year they process 
four or five, you know, instead of the 75 or 80 that

16:56.116 --> 17:07.789
they should be shoving through. They gave them 
building inspection under that program as well. I

17:12.601 --> 17:18.129
came in about that stage as an intern, by the way, 
out of A&M. They offered me, after I completed my

17:19.010 --> 17:25.139
internship, a position as assistant director of 
planning. We had a Harvard planning grad who was a

17:25.159 --> 17:30.807
specialist in housing. Working for me, an 
architecture student major out of A&M who was

17:31.512 --> 17:39.788
working as a planner.

17:41.190 --> 17:43.114
Usual sort of miscellaneous staff. We had a public 
administration specialist working in the

17:43.134 --> 17:47.783
department. So I and the Harvard were the two core 
identified design or unit planners, which is no

17:48.961 --> 17:59.566
big deal in and of itself. We also had the usual 
secretarial staff, three or four people sitting

18:00.388 --> 18:07.645
in our office, plus a couple of people in drafting 
and graphics. And things began to happen, and the

18:07.945 --> 18:14.434
decision, of course, was the dean was going to go 
after federal funding. And we went after federal

18:14.615 --> 18:17.619
funding in a very serious way. As a matter of fact, 
if I remember right, we were the second community

18:17.719 --> 18:31.118
in the Houston-Galliston area council to get, 
say, our transit system shoved through and

18:17.719 --> 18:31.118
approved by the council. We went after Community 
Development Block Grants, which were just coming

18:31.435 --> 18:39.751
out at that time, in 1974. We

18:39.811 --> 18:49.130
looked very seriously at EDA, LEAA, everything 
that had money attached to it. We wanted to try to

18:49.150 --> 18:51.334
find some way to make use of it. and things began to 
happen. There were a lot of things, money coming

18:54.320 --> 19:12.158
in, a lot of things happening, and we had a very 
confident city manager at the time, whose face I

18:54.320 --> 19:12.158
remember for some reason right at the moment, his 
name slips me, and just as everything was

18:54.320 --> 19:12.158
beginning to look just fantastic about a year into 
the program, And things were going along very

19:12.931 --> 19:21.702
well, and lots of money's pouring into the city, 
and lots of things are finally coming to fruition.

19:21.722 --> 19:25.888
And we got an emergency medical system, you know, 
took it away from the funeral homes finally. We

19:25.968 --> 19:29.232
still have funeral homes that run ambulances and 
college stationers. We have, we have funeral home

19:30.494 --> 19:33.318
ambulances too. They're now hospitals. Very 
good. The outcome of all of that was that the city

19:38.289 --> 19:48.007
manager got a rather fabby kind of offer from one of 
the accounting firms in town. He thought about it

19:48.167 --> 19:52.455
and he took the position. for a much higher salary, 
and he got to work 40 hours a week, and he got to go

19:53.110 --> 20:01.839
home and see his family in the evening, and there 
were no night meetings. And it was just wonderful,

20:02.059 --> 20:05.903
and he's very happy about that. And at that stage, a 
very interesting kind of thing happened. Under

20:11.188 --> 20:14.492
the city charter in Galveston... Do you know what 
year that was? Was that 62? No, this is 74. I mean 72.

20:19.117 --> 20:19.557
Yeah. Under the city charter in Galveston, if they 
can't make up their mind about what to do in terms of

20:20.836 --> 20:34.372
a city manager, the finance director becomes the 
acting city manager. Why it wouldn't be one of the

20:34.432 --> 20:38.737
assistant city managers, I don't know, or 
whatever. But the wisdom of the voters in 61

20:38.837 --> 20:48.548
indicated the finance department was the logical 
direction and step to go.

20:50.182 --> 20:52.488
Well, they couldn't make up their mind. They had 
applicants from all over because it looked like

20:52.829 --> 20:56.558
things were finally turned around. Good things 
were happening in Galveston. Salary scale was

20:58.503 --> 21:02.714
quite reasonable in getting up there. And the 
outcome was that out of these 30 or 50 or 60 or 80

21:05.200 --> 21:12.610
wonderful applications, two people on staff 
wanted it. One was Dean Mayberry, director of

21:12.730 --> 21:15.153
community development. The other was Jack 
Nicklaus or whatever his name was, not the golfer,

21:15.173 --> 21:24.846
but

21:15.173 --> 21:24.846
the director of finance. And as the negotiations 
went on, and the city council hemmed and hawed and

21:26.208 --> 21:34.279
wouldn't make up their mind about what to do, They 
turned around and let Nicholas take it as acting

21:34.850 --> 21:42.983
director. Well, of course, if somebody's acting 
director for three or four months, and then they

21:44.285 --> 21:58.647
have to make a decision who is likely to get the 
position, acting director, if he hasn't screwed

21:44.285 --> 21:58.647
it up royally.

21:59.960 --> 22:10.337
Nicholas played some real dirty politics and 
backstabbing, spread a lot of rumors, you know,

21:59.960 --> 22:10.337
usual dirty municipal infighting. I don't know 
anything about that. You don't know anything

22:12.400 --> 22:13.622
about that? Coming from university. Yes, and that 
never happens in universities, does it? No,

22:19.251 --> 22:21.255
especially Catholic universities. No. And the 
outcome is that Nicholas was appointed, Mayberry

22:27.820 --> 22:46.761
did not get to nod, and it was obvious that because 
of the nature of the fight that had occurred in the

22:27.820 --> 22:46.761
campaign for the position, that Mayberry was 
going to, although he was offered and everybody

22:27.820 --> 22:46.761
wanted to stay on, everybody said wonderful 
things about him, that, you know, he was not in a

22:27.820 --> 22:46.761
position particularly to stay on. So, you know, he 
dropped, let the ball drop, and within a week he had

22:46.801 --> 22:56.292
a position for more money elsewhere, and he's 
working in Waco now with with their mental health,

22:56.845 --> 22:59.869
mental retardation unit, the last I heard. Now 
that was a unit that had a scandal, and he went in and

23:00.350 --> 23:18.656
ended up, I don't know if you remember back in the 
mid-70s, it was a scandal, and giving funny

23:00.350 --> 23:18.656
injections to patients, and not keeping records 
on drugs, and oh yes, wonderful, typical good

23:00.350 --> 23:18.656
Texas stuff. And so anyway, he got brought in to 
clean that act up, and he had worked in Waco

23:18.676 --> 23:26.667
previously, so he was kind of going home to him. 
Nicholas, yeah, I was aware of that. He was among

23:32.421 --> 23:41.491
those that kind of got it started way back in the 60s 
in working community development. Anyway,

23:41.511 --> 23:44.735
Nicholas took an interesting style of 
management. Basically, the clothing style in the

23:46.117 --> 23:53.245
city manager's office became leisure suits.

23:55.587 --> 23:59.018
with jump boots that were bloused. Jump boots? 
Jump boots. Military jump boots. Carrying police

24:03.552 --> 24:09.411
shortwave radios on their hips so they could race 
to any emergency in town. Yeah.

24:13.697 --> 24:18.446
I took one look at that and I said, yeah, this is 
weird. Now Jack had been a Marine back in Corita. He

24:21.272 --> 24:29.307
had been a college football player and had been a 
pro lineman for a year or two back in the early 50s

24:21.272 --> 24:29.307
with the Baltimore Colts. And when he started 
wearing leisure suits that were bloused with junk

24:29.793 --> 24:40.611
boots and police band or short-wave radios, I kind 
of looked at that and I said, this is a little

24:29.793 --> 24:40.611
strange. Furthermore, I am sick and tired of 
educating city managers. Every time we get a

24:44.077 --> 24:52.571
program up and going, the city manager comes in and 
we educate him and get his support and things go

24:44.077 --> 24:52.571
along real nicely and smoothly. And then he quits 
and goes elsewhere. Well, I finally thought about

24:56.287 --> 25:08.220
it for a while, and I was really disgusted because 
I'd gotten three or four things I'd been working

24:56.287 --> 25:08.220
real hard on that had been busted partly as part of 
the disruption from the transition. And I got a

25:08.821 --> 25:18.872
phone call one day saying, hi, this is Carlisle 
Becker at Utah State calling, and we hear that you

25:08.821 --> 25:18.872
might be interested in teaching the university. 
And I said, sure. Fly me up, talk to me, and make me a

25:20.814 --> 25:24.758
money offer. And they did. And I did. I went. I quit. 
Most of the planners on staff quit. One planner got

25:34.762 --> 25:43.373
sucked in, Danny Fred, who was the housing man, 
downstairs at the city manager's office. I'm not

25:43.453 --> 25:51.083
sure what his job ultimately became, but he worked 
downstairs for a year, year and a half, making very

25:43.453 --> 25:51.083
good money. And Jack managed to show his political 
acumen by running a budget deficit of something

25:51.552 --> 25:58.142
like a half million dollars. One year. Now, in a 
community the size of Galveston, a half million

26:01.527 --> 26:06.214
dollars does attract attention. And he got 
canned, strangely enough. And Danny, who I got

26:12.884 --> 26:17.931
this information from, says, well... being 
single and from a wealthy family, it's time that I

26:18.232 --> 26:28.683
take a year or two and recuperate from all of this 
rather hard work and frayed nerves and so forth.

26:28.703 --> 26:36.110
And so he resigned and he lived in, pardon me, Danny 
Fred, one of the other planners that go down to the

26:28.703 --> 26:36.110
city manager's office. He resigned, went out to 
San Francisco and lived out there for a year or two

26:36.130 --> 26:43.458
before he got another job, you know, just living 
off his savings. And then he got a job somewhere in

26:44.299 --> 26:47.462
the Midwest, I think in Ohio, I don't know. And so at 
that stage, I lost contact with Galveston other

26:48.134 --> 27:12.617
than I hear Bruce says there's never been any 
planning done in Galveston, which is nice because

26:48.134 --> 27:12.617
if you look at the original city plan, be it 
engineering, civil engineering or not, you'll

26:48.134 --> 27:12.617
see that they've got an old map in here showing the 
original city as it was laid out by our friendly

26:48.134 --> 27:12.617
survey. Yeah. So, you know, it certainly was a 
planned community in every sense of the world in

27:13.278 --> 27:21.466
1836 when it became a city. And I think the level of 
planning that's occurred there, you know,

27:21.486 --> 27:33.178
certainly rigid subdivisions, the seagull, you 
can see very definite strong engineering and

27:21.486 --> 27:33.178
planning type responses. Now certainly that's 
not modern planning in any sense of the word, but on

27:33.258 --> 27:39.184
the other hand, you know there's been a lot of 
things done and it reflects and i think it shows in

27:40.582 --> 28:05.796
the community it's kind of a strange community in a 
lot of ways but you know there it is so that's where

27:40.582 --> 28:05.796
we've been with the city for some time and i don't 
know what they've done since then they do have some

27:40.582 --> 28:05.796
physical and environmental problems that are 
just absolutely phenomenal that may wind up

28:06.316 --> 28:11.803
finally crippling the city in a total sense. My 
feeling in the time I was there was the city had no

28:12.764 --> 28:16.608
business being there. I never said that when I was 
there. That was an unacceptable position. But the

28:23.316 --> 28:30.985
entire city is basically in a flood plain except 
for the area right on top of the seawall. The flood

28:31.005 --> 28:35.631
frequency from hurricanes is one hurricane hits 
there once every 10 years. The entire city

28:35.915 --> 28:38.159
basically goes under water. The area is subject to 
subsidence from the Houston-Galveston region.

28:44.549 --> 28:51.721
It relies on underground water from out to Loma 
Wells on the mainland, and it pumps water over to

28:44.549 --> 28:51.721
the island. And it's suffering a very serious 
coastal erosion problem, which was observable,

28:51.741 --> 29:02.158
and it was a problem when I was there that 
apparently has accelerated to as much as 25 feet

28:51.741 --> 29:02.158
per year on parts of the island.

29:05.092 --> 29:13.362
So, and when you consider the island at Twyatt 
Point is about two miles, two and a half miles

29:05.092 --> 29:13.362
across, you've got some very interesting things 
happening. In terms of my long-term view, I would

29:15.044 --> 29:20.730
not live on Galveston Island. I might, if I was 
wealthy, I might buy a house behind the seawall if I

29:21.831 --> 29:29.260
could find one that was available.

29:30.100 --> 29:38.994
It's probably not the kind of community you want to 
be looking at in terms of long-term investments.

29:39.014 --> 29:43.961
Now, there's a lot of money there and a lot of ways to 
make money, so people will go there and they'll

29:39.014 --> 29:43.961
live there. It's got a lot of very desirable things 
about it, climate, beach, water recreation. And

29:49.034 --> 29:51.918
this is the real problem with the Texas coast. 
Those islands happen to be where you can get to the

29:52.479 --> 29:55.363
beach. That's where your recreational potential 
is. South Padre Island's got exactly the same

29:58.348 --> 30:05.899
problem, except that it hasn't been there for 150, 
175 years.

30:09.684 --> 30:14.472
There's no record of who did the first plat on the 
coast. Is there? Who's responsible for the

30:14.692 --> 30:15.593
design? Because there is some design in this. Oh, 
yes. Yeah, there are some books on the history of

30:18.650 --> 30:22.715
Galveston that are available in the library. I 
don't recall the guy's name now that laid out the

30:22.815 --> 30:26.760
city. But yeah, certainly it is a very definitely 
designed city. And you can look at it very

30:35.089 --> 30:37.732
thoroughly. There are some features in it that 
remind me of Savannah. Yeah. Well, you've got a

30:41.397 --> 30:44.040
major boulevard coming into town. You have 
basically a major drive along the beach.

30:53.142 --> 31:16.112
open spaces yeah you've got regularly spaced open 
spaces some of which do not exist anymore you've

30:53.142 --> 31:16.112
got parks that are included you have essentially 
the urban area that's developed smaller city

30:53.142 --> 31:16.112
blocks the outlined areas that were viewed as 
being truck farm areas since then there have been

30:53.142 --> 31:16.112
roads cut these have become like avenue p and a half 
their only numeric letter system grid system a

31:16.632 --> 31:25.039
very strong physical engineering sense of design 
very good
