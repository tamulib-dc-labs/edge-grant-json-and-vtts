00:02.815 --> 00:07.521
Let me go back to those statements again. Dean 
Kyle, I worked with him after that. He not only was

00:11.265 --> 00:22.638
Ambassador to Guatemala after he retired there, 
but he served on the Farm Credit Board in Houston,

00:11.265 --> 00:22.638
and I served on the board there during the 50s. So we 
learned to know each other, and I always had the

00:22.658 --> 00:29.346
highest respect for him. I believe Kyle Field was 
named for Dean Kyle. He was chairman of the

00:33.062 --> 00:35.965
Athletic Committee. But an incidentalist 
nephew, Sid Kyle, was one of the star basketball

00:38.147 --> 00:46.777
players that lately made a big contribution to 
A&M. But anyway, there's fine, fine. The other is

00:50.441 --> 00:56.868
Dr. Bridges P. Lee, back in this statement, that 
remember people are important. I learned that so

00:56.949 --> 00:58.270
much. my later life being a county agent, working 
with people in the cooperation. But Dr. Virgil Lee

01:03.368 --> 01:09.559
went down there and headed up Production Credit 
Corporation in Houston. I believe he's still

01:09.619 --> 01:10.901
living. He's retired. Very active and high up in 
rosary clubs and things like that. But those are

01:17.914 --> 01:22.521
the two men, the statements I can remember the 
best. But there's others, mind you. They were just

01:24.845 --> 01:25.967
so good. In fact, I don't remember having any 
teacher down there that I didn't have the highest

01:26.127 --> 01:36.065
regard for, and I did get something from them. A 
couple of people I've talked to had

01:36.586 --> 01:43.018
had some problems with the chemistry department. 
Well, I didn't. In fact, I'd taken chemistry in

01:45.142 --> 01:48.608
high school, and I liked chemistry. So to me, it was 
not a bad course, Tom. Well, they didn't say that

01:51.782 --> 01:56.727
they didn't like the people. It's just it was a hard 
course to pass. Well, to me, it was easy. And I know

02:00.291 --> 02:04.455
each one has pumped out a lot.

02:07.238 --> 02:18.190
What attitudes did the students have towards the 
administration, that is, both the academic

02:07.238 --> 02:18.190
administration of the president and the military 
administration of the bull? I think it was very,

02:18.794 --> 02:20.316
very good. In fact, I can't keep from thinking, the 
first president when I was there, Dr. Bazell, when

02:20.716 --> 02:31.490
I was there incidentally about my junior year, 
went to Oklahoma University. But I've always

02:32.312 --> 02:36.437
considered him as one of the outstanding 
presidents. He had the, well, just everything it

02:37.438 --> 02:44.167
would take to be an outstanding president. Then 
Dr. Walton had followed. He came up through the

02:45.889 --> 02:48.092
Extension Service. was good. And, of course, the 
commander, what did we call him? Generally, I

02:57.451 --> 02:59.093
believe they called him the Bull. Commandant. 
Commandant. Well, to my knowledge, we didn't have

03:01.715 --> 03:05.619
any trouble when I was there. That reminds me of a 
story you want me to tell you? Sure. Well, about the

03:09.322 --> 03:12.846
commandant, military. In my senior year, it was 
Austin Hall there. Me and my roommate, Earl McCoy,

03:18.667 --> 03:20.709
the captain. We roomed on the second floor. One 
morning began to be a lot of liquid come down

03:23.511 --> 03:31.239
through the ceiling. So we got as scared as 
everything. And it turned out that somebody was

03:35.382 --> 03:38.605
making a home brew up there. Well, so had me. And I 
know the captain of the company, Earl McCoy,

03:42.989 --> 03:47.053
didn't know anything about it. But he got that 
cleaned up and cleaned out up there pretty

03:47.692 --> 03:51.319
quickly. And to my knowledge, he combed that and 
everything. And we would have inspectors come

03:54.765 --> 03:59.293
through the dormitory pretty often. That's the 
nearest we had to booze or whiskey in my four years

03:59.353 --> 04:06.406
at A&M was that up there. And I didn't even know it 
was there. And we didn't have the picture. or a

04:10.692 --> 04:13.997
pound down there to catch it. That took some pretty 
enterprising students. Yes, it did. To make up a

04:17.382 --> 04:22.930
batch of homebrew, and I imagine you had a fairly 
frequent inspection of your rooms, didn't you? We

04:23.070 --> 04:24.232
did, an inspection of the room. That's one thing 
the cadet corps taught you. Make up your bed, keep

04:26.595 --> 04:31.762
your shoes shined, and keep your room orderly and 
all. And you know, as old as I am, and my wife will

04:31.782 --> 04:39.113
take care of all these years, and then this and that 
will be made, I still like the idea of when a person

04:39.599 --> 04:47.553
gets up making up his bed, mind you, don't do it.

04:50.758 --> 04:59.153
Well, in my four years of college, even though it 
was not a military school, that was a common

04:50.758 --> 04:59.153
practice of both my roommate and I. We made up our 
beds when we got up.

05:06.329 --> 05:21.305
One of the things that I think is of interest about 
Texas A&M is the number of traditions which have

05:06.329 --> 05:21.305
been going on, such things as the bonfire, the 
senior boots, and things of that nature. Can you

05:22.146 --> 05:26.790
remember any things of this nature that were 
started while you were there? No. The bonfire was

05:27.251 --> 05:31.075
going on when I was there. Of course, it's a fresh 
one. And as upperclassmen, we got out and got the

05:34.882 --> 05:40.970
poles, timber, and so forth to make. We enjoyed 
that. Another thing we enjoyed was yell practice.

05:45.577 --> 05:47.620
We would do it then up in front of the Y. We'd get out 
there every so many evenings a week and have yell

05:48.541 --> 05:58.234
practice, particularly during the football 
season, some basketball. But those things, I

05:58.254 --> 06:04.483
don't recall offhand without thinking, any 
tradition that was started or something new that

06:05.813 --> 06:11.261
was started when I was there. One thing that I 
think, one thing I've observed in the three years

06:11.361 --> 06:24.081
I've been there is the week before the SMU game all 
the fish have to make spurs and make them out of coat

06:11.361 --> 06:24.081
hangers and coke bottle tops. Did the fish have to 
make the spurs while you were there? No, in my time

06:27.045 --> 06:28.728
we didn't. You didn't do that. Well, let's see, I 
believe, what, the senior boots started about the

06:31.244 --> 06:35.751
time you were there, didn't they? Senior boots was 
on when I was there. They were already wearing

06:38.195 --> 06:39.116
them. You could wear boots if you could afford 
them, or you could wear leather leggings. There

06:43.784 --> 06:45.727
were one or two of them. But only seniors could wear 
the leather leggings? Yes, that's right. The

06:50.354 --> 06:52.818
other students wore what? They wore your wrap 
leggings. Uh-huh. Just wrap you around. Let me

06:57.265 --> 06:59.108
tell you a story on that, you know. Every other 
year, we would go to Austin for the Texas game. So

07:04.795 --> 07:09.701
we'd go over the train, walk up Congress Avenue, 
which is uphill. So we'd get off and on. We'd have

07:12.225 --> 07:13.406
our guns. We'd walk and on, keep a step. There's 
probably a little strain. our legs would swell.

07:22.453 --> 07:27.967
Those leggings, you know, they really were tight 
when we got up there at the Capitol building. I'll

07:28.789 --> 07:30.373
never forget that. You just couldn't hardly walk. 
They kind of cut off the circulation when your legs

07:33.180 --> 07:37.431
would begin to swell, wouldn't they?

07:43.250 --> 07:46.033
Did you have a muster any of the time that you were 
there? I mean, we know that they started a muster of

07:46.053 --> 07:57.868
some sort in April 21st in 1903, but... You know, if 
we did, I don't remember. Recently, I tinned the

07:58.509 --> 08:09.182
last muster down there, but to my knowledge, 
that's the only muster I ever tinned unless, of

07:58.509 --> 08:09.182
course, we had it out there in front of the wire or 
something like that. Mm-hmm. But I don't recall

08:10.638 --> 08:12.761
it. It could have, but I forget. I'm sure the death 
that started in 1903, I'm sure we had no time there.

08:22.052 --> 08:28.480
But

08:22.052 --> 08:28.480
I just don't happen to recall. I know I didn't take 
an active part in it, other than be present. I was

08:33.145 --> 08:35.108
always present. If I lost a milking cow, I was 
present. You mentioned earlier that you ate your

08:38.954 --> 08:47.543
breakfast fairly near the table that the athletes 
had for their meals. Were there any other

08:48.304 --> 08:51.007
privileges that the athletes enjoyed? No, not 
that I know of. At that time, I don't recall them

08:54.011 --> 08:58.095
being in a separate dormitory. If they were, I 
don't remember. I don't know what hall it was or

08:59.617 --> 09:06.244
what not, but I do know But for breakfast, they 
would have a special table over there and would

09:07.355 --> 09:21.273
have their breakfast served to them there in the 
kitchen, side of the kitchen.

09:21.293 --> 09:26.980
But I don't remember the athletes having it. 
Frankly, I don't even remember if they having

09:27.000 --> 09:29.564
scholarships. They could have. I wouldn't have 
known anything. So they had to attend the regular

09:36.262 --> 09:39.327
drills?

09:40.990 --> 09:43.193
They may have been excused from some of them. I 
expect they were. Probably if they were

09:44.876 --> 09:48.121
practicing football at the same time as drills. 
Yes, I'm sure they've been excused. Were there

09:52.408 --> 09:55.814
ever any girls in any of the classes you attended? 
No, sirree. There was no girls on that campus. When

09:58.598 --> 10:01.543
the girls came there, it was on a special occasion. 
That time, TWU, Texas Women's University of

10:02.266 --> 10:13.082
Denton, they'd come down for football games or 
special occasions or something like that. But to

10:13.163 --> 10:23.238
my knowledge, they was not a girl, they was not a 
lady, even a wife of a student. We had a few students

10:24.480 --> 10:31.210
who were not in the cadet corps, living off the 
campus proper, so to speak. But I never saw a girl in

10:32.860 --> 10:43.594
an A&M class until I went back there a few months ago 
and attended the classes down there of Dr.

10:32.860 --> 10:43.594
Snyder's on cooperation. And we had one girl in one 
of the classes. Well, I have indications that

10:49.000 --> 10:56.590
there were occasionally girls attending classes 
during the regular sessions. Not in my time, but I

10:56.907 --> 11:05.017
sure never saw one on the campus except for the 
Space Academy. I think during summer they could

11:05.037 --> 11:07.620
attend pretty regularly. They might do it. I never 
did go to summer school. Well, there were no

11:12.106 --> 11:17.533
military activities on in the summers, I think, 
but there was some of that. I worked every summer,

11:17.813 --> 11:26.644
yeah. had an indication in looking at your senior 
yearbook that you were a distinguished student in

11:26.995 --> 11:32.345
1924. What did one have to do to be a distinguished 
student? I don't, frankly I'd forgotten that, but

11:39.618 --> 11:50.978
I'm sure it was because my grades were

11:39.618 --> 11:50.978
high. Well, you were also a member of the Panhandle 
Club, which was a regional club. That was. But you

11:56.324 --> 11:58.786
were also the Creaming Cow Club. That was the dairy 
club. That was called the Creaming Cow. All the

12:03.110 --> 12:06.733
people who majored in dairy husbandry were 
eligible for that. Did that meet monthly, or do you

12:06.793 --> 12:11.918
recall? Well, frankly, I don't recall, but I doubt 
they met monthly. Probably on call mostly, but

12:18.584 --> 12:21.707
could have met monthly. I frankly have just 
forgotten, but I do remember being a member of it.

12:28.597 --> 12:33.462
At one point you were president, starting with the 
yearbook. Yes. Okay, and being on, you were twice

12:33.582 --> 12:45.134
on the dairy judging team as a junior and then on the 
national dairy husbandry judging team. How were

12:46.475 --> 12:49.618
the members of those teams selected? They were 
selected, you'd get out there and judge cattle,

12:49.801 --> 13:06.624
judge deer cattle, place them, you know, and the 
ones that placed them the highest, I mean the most

12:49.801 --> 13:06.624
correct, was on the team. I guess I had some very 
good meetings, I have to tell you a story on that.

13:10.670 --> 13:13.254
You don't mind a little comedy, do you? No, not at 
all. Well, I'll never forget, we were staying at

13:14.836 --> 13:19.302
the La Salle Hotel in Chicago. There, Professor 
Darnell was there, coach, teacher. Well, we

13:24.944 --> 13:28.808
wanted to go to a show right close there, you know. I 
guess you'd call it a girly show now. But anyway, we

13:33.332 --> 13:38.197
sort of looked around the hotel for Dr. Professor 
Darnell. We couldn't see him. So we got over there,

13:40.579 --> 13:48.327
you know, sitting about the middle, looked right 
down in the front seat, and there was Dr. Darnell.

13:50.855 --> 13:55.213
So we never did let him know we were there. Well, I 
have an acquaintance who told a story something

13:55.234 --> 14:00.797
similar to that in a very recent year about having 
gone to a to another kind of national meeting and

14:01.233 --> 14:05.278
going to a show similar to that. And they were all 
the professors from his department at the same

14:05.298 --> 14:09.404
time. So I guess the faculty hadn't changed that 
much. No, they hadn't. Back to this selection of

14:14.331 --> 14:23.263
the team, did say the faculty in dairy husbandry 
first judge the dairy cattle to see how they would

14:14.331 --> 14:23.263
place them? And then the students who came closest 
to that? I'd say the coach judged them. The coach

14:27.268 --> 14:28.810
judged them first. He judged them, and if you 
placed them like he placed them, well, you were

14:29.802 --> 14:34.409
right. And then when you went to a show, they had 
judges, I would say. And would they then judge them

14:39.797 --> 14:46.147
first, and then the team that placed them closest 
to that would be the winning team? As a team and as

14:46.167 --> 14:49.252
individuals. So a team could have the top 
individual but not come out too well in the

14:49.472 --> 14:56.062
standings of the team. That's possible.

14:59.620 --> 15:03.986
You graduated then in the spring of 1927.

15:06.009 --> 15:07.571
Did you have a job? It all lightened up by the time 
you graduated? Yes, I did. I came out to Seminole in

15:09.954 --> 15:15.582
Gaines County before I graduated. They promised 
me or they gave me a job as county agent in Gaines

15:17.424 --> 15:22.391
County. So I was county agent in Gaines County 
starting in 27, then about 28. or 29, they added

15:30.097 --> 15:33.983
Terry County to it. Then they separated the two and 
I preferred to stay in Terry County because they

15:34.003 --> 15:41.355
had more farmers and they had more kids. I was great 
on the 4-H club kids. We still had those country

15:44.140 --> 15:48.246
school hours and we had a 4-H club in every country 
school. Both boys and girls was in it. We didn't

15:51.491 --> 15:55.598
have a home demonstration agent in either of those 
counties. So I was there, and then I went to

15:56.860 --> 16:03.387
Plainview in 32 as county agent up there, and they 
did have a home demonstration agent there. So as

16:05.530 --> 16:10.796
county agent, was it primarily your function to 
work with the 4-H club? Yes, it was, and with the

16:12.178 --> 16:13.679
farmers. With the farmers. Did you do somewhat 
similar to the county agent's job today,

16:15.581 --> 16:19.346
distribute bulletins? Somewhat, except we had 
much fewer bulletins then. We had much fewer. Oh,

16:26.611 --> 16:29.194
specialist.

16:32.038 --> 16:35.822
County agent was county agent then. And we looked 
at A&M, and we would have what we called a short

16:35.842 --> 16:44.072
course, I believe we called it down there in the 
summer. Terry County would generally have more

16:44.813 --> 16:47.637
down there. We'd drive to post and catch a train 
down there and go there. And you know, some of my...

16:56.665 --> 17:03.814
One of them became a state senator in New Mexico. 
Another, very good past, became a millionaire in

17:03.914 --> 17:08.861
the grain business. So it's very interesting, 
very good. But that's where I go back to Dr. Lee's

17:13.567 --> 17:16.931
statement. People is the most important thing.

17:21.387 --> 17:25.051
So then how long were you county agent there? Five 
years. In Plainview? Plainview, I left, went up to

17:27.173 --> 17:36.982
Plainview in September of 30 and went with the Hale 
County Deer Association in February of 32. From

17:38.564 --> 17:44.249
then on, I've been with cooperatives.

17:46.131 --> 17:47.833
What cooperatives have you been with? I was with 
the Hale County Deer Association, which became

17:48.050 --> 18:12.673
the Plains Cooperative of Kringman, 32 to 38, and 
went with the Houston Bank Cooperative as

17:48.050 --> 18:12.673
secretary and vice president from 38 to 43, and 
came out here as general manager of the mill out

17:48.050 --> 18:12.673
here from 43 to 71.

18:13.852 --> 18:19.362
The Hales County Dairy Association would be an 
organization of dairy farmers. Dairy farmers. In

18:20.424 --> 18:28.438
those days, every farmer milked cow and sold cream 
or milk for cheese making. We became the largest

18:28.458 --> 18:34.830
creamer making butter and cheese in several 
southwestern states. So the farmers, instead of

18:35.182 --> 18:41.929
selling the cream to a commercial creamery, 
established their own creamery. That's right.

18:43.070 --> 18:46.094
And they could produce it. They could make more 
money. Make more money. We'd pay dividends. And

18:51.079 --> 18:59.528
then you would also buy your—would the farmers 
then buy their feed through the cooperative? At

18:59.548 --> 19:03.332
that time, we didn't have a feed cooperative like 
they have now. They would buy their gasoline and

19:04.105 --> 19:12.934
oil from what we call a consumer station just 
across the street from Cramer. But I would suppose

19:12.954 --> 19:19.140
at that point most of the dairy farmers raised a 
good bit of their own feed, wouldn't they? They

19:19.160 --> 19:22.063
raised most of their own feed and had pastures. But 
they did buy some feed, but we had no cooperative

19:22.363 --> 19:31.412
dairy feed like we have now.

19:32.152 --> 19:38.438
The Farm Credit Association in Houston, what was 
the function of that organization? Well, it

19:38.458 --> 19:45.104
started with the Federal Land Bank in 1917 making 
loans up to twenty years on farm land. Then, about

19:46.865 --> 20:01.939
1923, they added what they called the 
Intermediate Credit Bank that would make loans

19:46.865 --> 20:01.939
for short-term loans for production for ranchers 
and farmers. Then about 1934, they had the

20:02.948 --> 20:19.990
Cooperative Bank and Production Credit 
Association, which was financed out of the

20:02.948 --> 20:19.990
Federal Intermediate Credit Bank. But they had 
what they called the Production Credit Corp.

20:20.111 --> 20:25.137
place, which Dr. Lee headed up. But I would say, 
without a doubt, in my opinion, The farm credit

20:32.311 --> 20:42.003
system is the greatest

20:32.311 --> 20:42.003
system that's ever been developed in Washington 
for the farmer. Because in it, thank goodness,

20:42.884 --> 20:52.396
they required the farmer to buy stock, 5% stock, 
out of each dollar loan. So pretty soon, in 53, and

20:53.218 --> 20:59.145
incidentally, I was very active in getting that 
through to work. we could remove it from the

20:59.648 --> 21:08.857
Department of Agriculture and make it an 
independent government agency where the

20:59.648 --> 21:08.857
borrowers paid all the expenses. And in doing so, 
they elected all the directors and operate the

21:09.497 --> 21:15.663
system themselves. Now, it's totally on. Their 
bonds that they sell are not guaranteed by the

21:17.365 --> 21:25.913
government at all. So I'd say it's been one of the 
greatest examples of the government helping the

21:29.264 --> 21:32.149
people to help themselves.

21:34.853 --> 21:39.059
And then you became general manager of the Plains 
Co-op oil mill. In 1943, and it was broke, just like

21:40.081 --> 21:46.010
the Hill County Deer Association was broke. I went 
with that creamery plain deal, $100 a month less

21:46.030 --> 21:52.140
than I was getting this county agent. But I liked to 
work. I liked to think of it. And so we got things

21:54.564 --> 21:56.166
straightened out. They came out here while the 
stock was worth six cents on the dollar. They grew

22:01.547 --> 22:04.993
in the largest oil, cotton seed oil mill in the 
world. Working with people. So this is the, the,

22:08.037 --> 22:19.315
the foreign cotton growers then bring their 
cotton seed to the mill. Well really, the cotton

22:19.415 --> 22:22.881
growers own the cooperative gin. They bring their 
cotton. Seed cotton to the gin is gin. The gin buys

22:28.276 --> 22:31.780
the seed, and the gin was a member of the mill. So the 
mill was a federation of cooperative gin. It

22:35.345 --> 22:40.071
started in 1937, but had some bad years, like what 
broke. I gather from what I've been able to pick up

22:42.313 --> 22:52.866
that that

22:42.313 --> 22:52.866
was not an uncommon thing for cooperatives to go 
broke at it. Well, that was true. They were

22:56.477 --> 22:57.819
underfinanced. Well, I'll tell you a little 
story. Now, Hill County Deer Association, when it

22:59.221 --> 23:04.669
started, they couldn't borrow from the banks up 
there. They borrowed from the Plainview Savable

23:05.650 --> 23:13.001
Loan Association and agreed to pay them 12.5% 
interest. This was 1927. Well, when the

23:15.084 --> 23:22.515
Depression hit, the Plainview Savable Loan 
Association went broke. So instead of getting

23:23.812 --> 23:31.581
2.5% of that money back, which they're supposed to 
get, they got nothing back. So we were paying 12.5%

23:32.342 --> 23:36.046
interest up there in depression. And we 
refinanced, and I make this claim, that I paid the

23:36.727 --> 23:44.817
highest interest that any cooperator's ever 
paid, and I paid the lowest. And we refinanced

23:44.877 --> 23:46.639
them. The old federal board, you know, under 
President Hoover, I hit the low market one-eighth

23:50.558 --> 23:57.467
of one percent, one-hundredth of what we were 
paying. So you refinanced your note and then paid

23:57.487 --> 24:00.851
it off after that? That's right. Then when we 
expanded, of course, we borrowed from the Houston

24:01.632 --> 24:05.777
Bank and cooperated. We paid about four percent 
there. So the plains mill was in pretty sad shape

24:09.381 --> 24:14.187
when you came to it? Well, it was just on the bottom. 
And you saw it? I thought—I was working with the

24:21.372 --> 24:33.046
bank and calling on them, and my two boys were 
growing up, our two boys were growing up, so Dennis

24:21.372 --> 24:33.046
and me were both raised out here in Miradace 
Middle. So we wanted to come back to Plains. They

24:34.828 --> 24:36.029
gave me a chance at it. So I came back out here and 
took it. And I've never regretted it because we had

24:40.775 --> 24:46.722
some dry years, but right after World War began to 
develop irrigation out here, and the mill began to

24:47.663 --> 24:56.416
get more seed, and quickly grew into the biggest 
oil mill in the world. Okay, so I'll ask this

24:56.436 --> 25:00.402
largely out of my own ignorance. What is the oil 
used for? The oil is used as human food. Cotton seed

25:04.668 --> 25:10.777
oil competes with other vegetable oils, 
including lard, animal fat. But cotton seed oil

25:11.779 --> 25:13.902
has a few qualities. It's the best solid oil there 
is. And as such, it bring a little primal soybean

25:18.055 --> 25:28.205
oil, which is the big vegetable oil, because it's 
so much bigger than cottonseed. But cottonseed

25:28.225 --> 25:36.433
oil is used, of course, the protein, the meal, is 
used as animal feed, you know. They're trying to

25:36.453 --> 25:38.675
make it into a food now. That is, once you've 
crushed the seed and extracted the oil, the solid

25:38.755 --> 25:45.902
matter that's left is made into feed. They're the 
meal. The first you get off of is the letters. Then

25:50.046 --> 25:51.307
you have the hose. Then you have your meal. Then you 
have your oil. It's about, I don't know, really

25:54.832 --> 25:57.536
about five products. First and second cut 
letters, hose, and meal, and oil. So there's not

26:02.543 --> 26:04.245
any of it that's wasted. No, sir. No, sir. And you 
know, A&M contributed a lot to that. Mr. A.L. Ward,

26:10.574 --> 26:13.999
before my time down there, just a few years ago, He 
proved that cotton seed meal was good cattle and

26:15.481 --> 26:20.027
sheep feed. It had been killing hogs and chickens, 
but for ruminants and all, cattle and sheep, it was

26:20.047 --> 26:27.698
good. So I would credit that to the research 
station there at Texas A&M and A.O. Washington.

26:35.512 --> 26:42.639
Well, you say they're now doing a good bit of 
research there on making human feed out of the

26:35.512 --> 26:42.639
cotton seed. Move it up the ladder. At first it was 
fertilizer, and then it was feed. Now it's going to

26:46.843 --> 26:47.964
be food.

26:51.007 --> 26:58.634
Since you've retired from the Plains Cooperative 
Mill, you've been associated with the Textile

26:51.007 --> 26:58.634
Research Center at Texas Tech? Yes. Or were you 
associated with that before retirement? After

27:01.637 --> 27:04.320
retirement. Enjoyed it through, and I think we got 
some things started out there. It's going to be as

27:08.881 --> 27:12.565
revolutionary as this cotton seed mill. What sort 
of projects are you doing out there? Well, what we

27:16.949 --> 27:28.963
were doing out there, I think the one that we were 
doing everything out there that Texter Mill

27:16.949 --> 27:28.963
wanted to do, but the one that really broke through 
was on what we call open-end spinning. It would

27:29.443 --> 27:34.729
handle our low-grade cotton and low-micronaire 
cotton make a good yarn, and in turn make a good

27:36.025 --> 27:46.978
fabric, coarse fabric, like denim, twilled, and 
things like that. Well, I suppose we need a lot more

27:46.998 --> 27:50.923
denim with the popularity of blue jeans. I believe 
it's here to stay. I believe so, too. So then it

27:54.927 --> 28:02.376
makes the low-grade cotton a more profitable 
commodity. It has been a discount cotton. It's

28:04.218 --> 28:05.560
going to raise the value. which will raise the 
whole economy of the Plains area. And we're

28:12.810 --> 28:16.174
getting textile mills out here, too. I've spent 
all my time on that. You're what, trying to

28:19.277 --> 28:21.218
encourage textile mills? Textile mills to come 
out here. Both foreign and domestic. You had much

28:26.523 --> 28:27.845
success so far? Yes, so far we have. We've got a 
combination here of what we call Feather Fabrics,

28:29.246 --> 28:36.593
a local cap planer. hauling mill called Hinkedi. 
Then we have the Japanese people coming in to

28:39.468 --> 28:46.338
Leveland, which will be called Diwaba, America. 
And then we have two small textile mills here, one

28:47.580 --> 28:56.073
at Abernathy, one at Loringa, which are trying to 
change over to open and spinning. And frankly, the

28:57.014 --> 29:04.065
cooperators are trying to work out a program here 
where they can go all the way and produce the fabric

28:57.014 --> 29:04.065
out here of denim. And that's still in the 
development stage. But it's coming along. So that

29:10.193 --> 29:19.342
in addition to improving a lot of the cotton 
producer, you will also be creating additional

29:10.193 --> 29:19.342
jobs for... Additional jobs. You know, I served as 
chairman of the Protection of Rural Development

29:19.362 --> 29:22.766
Commission. You can look at the record. We had an 
out-migration of 10 to 25 percent during the 60s of

29:25.689 --> 29:31.335
our population. was far and beyond larger, more 
mechanized, more chemicals. Didn't need people.

29:37.379 --> 29:39.624
Some people left. And now we're trying to develop 
agri-industries. And Texas will offer us one of

29:44.655 --> 29:49.746
our great opportunities.
