WEBVTT

00:01.837 --> 00:07.444
elevated bed when the revolution started and they 
abandoned the project. I don't know what the

00:07.905 --> 00:11.750
revolution would have properly if they had had the 
railroad. That's why they didn't have

00:12.391 --> 00:16.697
communications to move the troops. Of course, the 
revolution had to come and they had to win, but it

00:18.259 --> 00:24.587
would have lasted longer.

00:29.056 --> 00:30.758
I mean, it wouldn't have lasted as long. No, it 
would have lasted longer if they had built the

00:31.039 --> 00:39.229
Laredo because the federal troops would have had 
access to these sections. Oh, I see, to the border

00:39.269 --> 00:40.511
area. Well, just how important was this region up 
and down the border, say, from Laredo south? Was it

00:46.298 --> 00:49.022
important to the revolution? Well, they had to 
take it because they couldn't get the supplies.

00:53.133 --> 00:56.298
Once they got to the border town, they couldn't get 
supplies. I see. The United States was in favor of

00:56.999 --> 01:00.824
the revolution, with supplies and arms. So that's 
why places like Nuevo Laredo and Guerrero and all

01:02.767 --> 01:08.556
these places were important. Were there ever any 
battles in Guerrero? No, no, no. Because they

01:12.561 --> 01:15.025
didn't have an important motto. The people left, 
the revolutionaries came, they ransacked the

01:15.045 --> 01:18.570
town. I went to, after we left, a few days later, I 
went to Guerrero again with another cousin of mine

01:19.276 --> 01:28.131
to see what was, bring some more stuff. And we find 
the doors broken and all the rooms empty, empty,

01:28.592 --> 01:37.246
everything. Of your home, all your furniture and 
everything? Furniture and clothing and

01:40.071 --> 01:43.056
everything. Oh, and this is after you'd come 
across the river. Yes, in April 1913, when we moved

01:45.680 --> 01:49.111
to Zapata. A few days later, I went back to 
Guerrero. My father sent me with another cousin in

01:51.799 --> 01:55.510
Bahia. by horse carriage to see what we could 
salvage. We didn't find anything. And there had

02:02.613 --> 02:04.696
been... This is my other sister. My sister. One of 
the six. One of the six sisters. How old are you? I'm

02:12.005 --> 02:13.066
married to no one. This is my daughter. She's from 
California. She's living in California. And this

02:17.992 --> 02:19.834
is my daughter. And this is my mother. And what 
they're teaching me, telling me that I have to

02:24.751 --> 02:32.023
learn and remember again the weather here. It gets 
rather pleasant in the morning. Yes, that's what I

02:34.968 --> 02:36.651
thought. I'm glad to see you. I'm going. I'm going 
to visit. For the Hawaiian visitors, summer

02:39.555 --> 02:44.223
friends, my sister. Well, that's all.

02:51.363 --> 03:03.315
But do

02:51.363 --> 03:03.315
you like

02:51.363 --> 03:03.315
a cup of tea, a cup of coffee? Anything?

03:08.261 --> 03:18.231
A cup of coffee would be very nice.

03:19.780 --> 03:23.305
to have a conference with him. And then one of the 
times he told one of the reporters, will it be

03:23.325 --> 03:37.404
possible that Francisco Madero will start a 
revolution? He says, any fool can start a

03:37.564 --> 03:40.908
revolution. It will take a genius to finish. And 
then another thing he said, Unfortunately,

03:48.333 --> 03:55.575
Mexican people are so far from God and so close to 
the United States,

04:03.048 --> 04:12.085
Well, I'd like for you to tell me a little bit more 
about really a completely different subject, and

04:03.048 --> 04:12.085
that is the building of Falcon Dam and the 
refugees. You really have another set of refugees

04:12.666 --> 04:17.235
when the floodwaters covered Guerrero, don't 
you? Yeah, they covered a raw deal, the poor

04:17.435 --> 04:21.242
people. because they just abandoned them. The 
Mexican government did? No, the American side.

04:27.889 --> 04:28.930
The American side? There was nothing on the 
Mexican side. Oh, I thought Guerrero was. No,

04:33.495 --> 04:35.237
Guerrero. They compensated the owners of the 
houses in Guerrero and built houses for them on the

04:35.637 --> 04:41.824
new Guerrero. Oh, the Mexican government did 
that? Yes, on the Mexican side. But on the American

04:44.467 --> 04:49.272
side, the ranches and everything, they got the 
Rodil. They compensated them in a very poor way.

04:54.791 --> 04:55.773
Well, tell me about it. How did it all come about? 
Politics, I guess. They didn't have stronger

04:58.498 --> 05:01.723
politicians to speak for them. Well, how did the 
dam come about? How did all of this happen?

05:10.210 --> 05:18.943
People in the valley, they needed some more water 
because they were extracting water from the Rio

05:10.210 --> 05:18.943
Grande for the valley, or so many, say, dozen 
cities. Very well developed. On the Mexican side,

05:20.926 --> 05:24.110
it was underdeveloped. So Mexico and the United 
States agreed to build that dam so that they could

05:24.130 --> 05:35.627
cut enough water to irrigate both the American 
side and create an irrigation system on the

05:24.130 --> 05:35.627
Mexican side. And then it was agreed on a 60-40% 
basis. The United States would get 60% and the rest

05:38.751 --> 05:44.057
was 40%. It took about 3 or 4 years to build it. It 
cost about 40 or 50 million dollars. They did a good

05:51.186 --> 05:52.367
job. And then on the Mexican side they built a 
hydroelectric plant too. to serve Guerrero. I

05:59.196 --> 06:04.744
think they bring the power to Nueva Guerrero. You 
say the Mexican government built a whole new town.

06:09.651 --> 06:14.758
Yes, they compensated them enough to build new 
houses in the new Guerrero. Modern houses are

06:15.179 --> 06:19.485
bricks or prefabricated houses. And did they 
build them, you know, a new church and school and

06:20.309 --> 06:25.316
this sort of thing? Yes, a church and a municipal 
city hall. They moved a statue of Benito Juarez and

06:28.179 --> 06:36.510
a clock. They called it a clock. Of course, it's out 
of fix. That clock was purchased in France. They

06:43.520 --> 06:45.682
had it in the city hall in the old Guerrero. It was a 
very exact clock. Well, how did the people feel?

06:50.106 --> 06:52.089
Were they satisfied with moving? They had 
opportunities to plant in the old garage. They

06:57.614 --> 07:01.539
didn't have pumps or anything to lift the water for 
irrigation. And then they have this tourist trade

07:02.340 --> 07:06.204
and the fishing industry. And then the 
transportation. The new garage is a

07:09.688 --> 07:11.950
transportation center. So it's really done 
pretty, those people have done pretty well. And

07:16.610 --> 07:22.080
then they have this irrigation system below the 
river, down to Matamoros. But you say on the United

07:22.861 --> 07:26.146
States side it wasn't that way. Because it was just 
the ranch owners, it was nothing being a big deal.

07:33.479 --> 07:35.963
Just a few ranchers that had their little houses 
there. I don't think they got proper

07:36.398 --> 07:41.066
indemnization for it. That's the general word.

07:47.438 --> 07:56.013
When President Eisenhower came to inaugurate the 
dam, the people were living in tents near Falcon.

07:57.075 --> 07:58.457
She saw them there in tents. Well,

08:00.496 --> 08:06.184
what about Nuzapata? Were the people given houses 
or anything? I think... I don't know. They got some

08:12.854 --> 08:15.378
sort of compensation. Some sort of compensation. 
But not as much as on the Mexican side. No, I don't

08:19.744 --> 08:22.588
know the details, but they are satisfied. And then 
the talk has grown. It has grown. And then they talk

08:25.610 --> 08:33.741
about highways from here to Zapata, and then from 
Zapata to Quebronville, from Zapata down to the

08:25.610 --> 08:33.741
valley. Has life changed a lot in New Zapata? 
Modernized now. There are many

08:37.826 --> 08:43.513
fishing industries, motels. Do you think people 
are as satisfied as they were before? People in

08:50.181 --> 08:52.305
Zapata, are they as satisfied? Certainly, better 
than they were before. Because Zapata was a little

08:55.530 --> 08:59.376
sleepy town too. There were not good 
communications.

09:05.706 --> 09:11.475
But back when it was actually happening, when the 
lands were being flooded, were you ever down

09:05.706 --> 09:11.475
there? Back when the lands were being flooded, 
what was it like? When the water was building up

09:16.698 --> 09:19.142
behind the dam? Well, it didn't affect the water 
very much. Just on the creeks, the water just went

09:23.147 --> 09:28.614
there. Not much. It didn't reclaim many lands, of 
course. The federal government retained title to

09:32.600 --> 09:41.091
certain distance from the highest level of the 
water to the inland. A strip of land is owned by the

09:41.797 --> 09:48.604
government, and the government in times allowed 
them to graze their cattle. So they eventually got

09:49.866 --> 09:51.868
involved. Then they discovered this livestock 
industry is very profitable in oil, oil

09:53.750 --> 10:00.257
production. That's nature. In deserts they have 
oil, because nature compensates one thing for the

10:03.761 --> 10:09.087
other.

10:12.087 --> 10:16.571
Do you still have relatives in Guerrero? All my 
uncles and aunts and everything, they are dead.

10:21.096 --> 10:21.556
They're dead. Did their children come to the 
States, or did they stay there? They lived there,

10:25.140 --> 10:27.382
but we have lost track of them. Oh, I see. So they're 
there, but you just don't visit very much. Our

10:31.546 --> 10:34.469
closest relative was my uncle. He moved here to 
Laredo and died here. Did he bring a family, too?

10:39.854 --> 10:41.115
Sure, there could have been family. he brought 
what his wife and his wife and children how many

10:41.517 --> 11:08.014
children did he have you see how destiny works my 
uncle had a little ranch where this seven sisters

10:41.517 --> 11:08.014
land do you know about that no it's an old section of 
seven sisters because he owned a ranch there

10:41.517 --> 11:08.014
soledad was named and back in 1905 or 19 there was 
1900

11:08.838 --> 11:15.348
He wanted, he had his eyes

11:08.838 --> 11:15.348
toward Mexico. And see, he engaged in 
surveillance and started to survey the landscape

11:16.449 --> 11:25.002
and found that there were many lands that didn't 
have any owners. Then he reported that to Mexico

11:26.044 --> 11:29.789
City as a reward. They needed a big chunk of land, 
about 18 or 20,000 acres. Then, so he sold it right

11:35.959 --> 11:38.322
here. In the United States. Yes, and then went to 
there and engaged in politics. In the meantime,

11:42.669 --> 11:45.878
that land, he got millions now. If he had stayed 
here, he would have been a millionaire. So he had

11:51.262 --> 11:53.004
had a ranch. Was it a ranch he inherited? He owned a 
ranch here. Had he inherited it or how did he get it?

11:58.128 --> 11:59.109
He bought it. And he lived in Guerrero, but he 
bought a ranch. No, he lived in the ranch and

12:01.731 --> 12:05.795
then... Oh, he lived in the United States. I see. 
And then from time to time, they would go to

12:07.096 --> 12:14.322
Guerrero for two or three months to have the 
children, then come back to the ranch. But it was

12:14.342 --> 12:19.647
that misguided loyalty, I call it. Misguided 
loyalty. Because in about 1907, he went back to

12:21.232 --> 12:28.720
live in Guerrero and bought a big land and then 
engaged in politics. And since he was a

12:28.900 --> 12:41.333
conservative, he was one of the group of people 
that controlled the town, the political life of

12:28.900 --> 12:41.333
the town. And then became mayor. One night in 
September 1912,

12:52.130 --> 12:54.052
We were celebrating the independence. And then 
after midnight, we lived across the street. We

13:01.602 --> 13:05.547
heard a big explosion across from us. And then 
immediately another big explosion. And then two

13:08.271 --> 13:11.455
or three minutes later, another explosion fired 
away. Then later on we found that these

13:12.397 --> 13:17.546
revolutionaries had put two bombs in their house. 
One on the big gate that all those houses had to put

13:18.167 --> 13:25.340
the carriage in. They put one there and another one 
in another door. It was a two-story house. But the

13:32.815 --> 13:35.738
night was warm. They decided instead of sleeping 
upstairs, they went to the yard and sleep there.

13:42.025 --> 13:49.493
That saved them because they destroyed the second 
story and blew it up. He would have killed them.

13:51.095 --> 13:52.116
This was your uncle's family? My uncle. He was the 
mayor. And the other one was another political

13:54.238 --> 13:57.962
chief. They put it on the door, on the gate, but it 
did some damage, but it didn't do anything to the

13:58.381 --> 14:08.554
man, a man named Ramirez. That was one thing. And 
then that was in September 1912. Then in 1913 is

14:15.623 --> 14:24.895
when Madero was killed and Huerta took power. A few 
days before April, they attacked the town. And my

14:30.379 --> 14:42.831
uncle called policemen and certain individuals 
armed on the roofs of the houses to defend the

14:30.379 --> 14:42.831
government in case of attack. Well, they came and 
attacked. And these fellows that he could pay just

14:45.573 --> 14:47.755
quit. They got cold feet. They stay flat and didn't 
do anything. So my uncle's sons, And my father had

14:55.283 --> 15:00.953
to go to the ropes and repel the attackers, repel 
them. Now, this uncle was your father's brother?

15:04.781 --> 15:05.702
My father's brother. And what was his name? 
Sinesio. Sinesio Gutierrez. So my children, they

15:10.772 --> 15:13.697
cut the bones and they'd chop bones. They came in a 
horseback. They found that they could not take it.

15:19.551 --> 15:22.436
They went to assassinate my uncle. Did you get on 
the roof with a gun too? No, no, I was very young

15:24.139 --> 15:25.761
then. I went with my mother into the room. We had a 
big house, 350, so we were safe there. So it lasted

15:34.376 --> 15:36.460
about half an hour or so. They could not take it and 
left. And then they knew who these men that put

15:40.897 --> 15:44.922
those bombs were. They were part of the 
revolutionaries. And my uncle asked help from the

15:48.547 --> 15:54.214
governor of Tamaulipas to send in troops or 
somebody. They could not send, so decided to quit.

15:57.738 --> 16:06.229
Then at night, they left by foot, went from 
Guerrero to a little ranch about a few miles south

15:57.738 --> 16:06.229
of Zapata. Then in the morning we found that my 
father wasn't there, my uncle wasn't there. Then

16:11.791 --> 16:16.303
my aunt told them, no, they are safe already on the 
American side. Now we are going to Zapata now. We

16:18.809 --> 16:19.932
can go. But we cannot take anything just because we 
have arms. Did you leave the very next day or was it

16:22.882 --> 16:26.607
the next morning? The very next morning. It's two 
miles from, of course it took us three hours to get

16:27.408 --> 16:32.015
there by carriage. It wasn't really that far then. 
No, it wasn't that far, but by carriage it took

16:34.698 --> 16:40.987
longer to travel two miles. Well, your uncle then, 
did he ever get any land on the United States side

16:42.149 --> 16:48.197
after you moved here?

16:52.295 --> 16:57.143
Your uncle, what did he do after he got to the States 
to make a living? Did he lose his land in Mexico? No.

17:00.228 --> 17:09.844
At that time the revolution was about over and he, 
of course the land was, at that time livestock was

17:00.228 --> 17:09.844
worth about $30 per head. During the revolution, 
the hide were very valuable. So the revolution

17:15.627 --> 17:23.216
would slaughter the livestock just to reclaim the 
hide and ship it to the United States. So they stole

17:24.237 --> 17:26.279
all his cattle. Oh, I see. Then when things became 
settled, he leased the land, the subsoil, to one of

17:28.482 --> 17:36.051
these American companies. They paid him very good 
rental. Very good rental. And then, when the

17:41.975 --> 17:47.103
revolution ended, he took over the ranch again. 
This is his ranch in Mexico? In Mexico, yes. Did he

17:52.050 --> 17:53.493
move back to Mexico? He stayed here, but he... But 
he managed, his children managed the ranch.

18:01.645 --> 18:06.092
There's another incident during the...

18:10.713 --> 18:29.616
December 1913, 1913,

18:10.713 --> 18:29.616
when we moved back here, my uncle sent his family to 
the south and he and the trio of his children

18:10.713 --> 18:29.616
remained in Nuevo Laredo because they organized, 
the Guatagoros organized the a group of armed men

18:30.254 --> 18:45.135
called the Defensa Social, Social Defense, and 
they recruited all these civilians to bear arms,

18:30.254 --> 18:45.135
and they are the ones who helped to defend the city. 
My uncle remained there, so.

18:53.648 --> 18:55.350
No.

18:56.782 --> 19:00.727
Yes, my uncle moved here, the children stayed 
there, that was on December. Now, on April, he

19:00.747 --> 19:05.834
moved back to Nuevo Laredo. And then, when the 
government troops burned the town and left the

19:06.615 --> 19:15.988
city, they took my uncle and his boys with them. 
Because they had no choice. They had to go with

19:19.044 --> 19:19.986
them. So they went off with the government troops. 
That was the troops of Huerta, Victoriana Huerta.

19:24.475 --> 19:28.483
And they went as far as Villaldana. Yes, I know 
where Villaldana is. So he returned, but I don't

19:34.818 --> 19:39.085
know if I heard back or something. How did he get 
away then from the government troops? Did they

19:42.170 --> 19:43.532
just... When everything disbanded, the 
government troops went to another route and

19:43.933 --> 19:51.105
Pancho Villa met them. And then they had a battle 
and won the battle and killed the general that had

19:52.047 --> 19:58.614
defended Nuevo Laredo. It was General Guardiola. 
He was a colonel and they made him general. They

20:04.741 --> 20:06.202
killed him there. My uncle and his son came by 
horseback and they were intercepted by the

20:07.804 --> 20:15.593
Carranza troops and brought to Nuevo Laredo as 
prisoners. Then they released the boys. And what

20:21.967 --> 20:25.552
kept him, they said that they were going to execute 
him. But finally they started to pull strings and

20:26.233 --> 20:40.813
then finally they managed to, they captured him in 
San Ignacio. That's where they captured him, in

20:41.054 --> 20:43.137
San Ignacio. They were about to cross when they 
caught him. So they relieved the boys and kept my

20:45.780 --> 20:47.803
uncle. And then finally they got to, got the 
concession to take him to Matamoros to try him

20:51.532 --> 20:56.437
there. They took him by carriage. Took him to 
Matamoros. From Matamoros, they took him to

21:00.761 --> 21:02.463
Monterrey. Monterrey, they got him to pay him 
about 45,000 pesos in Mexican currency. He had

21:12.292 --> 21:13.994
money in the banks in Monterrey. He paid that 
money. And they released him, and then he went by

21:15.175 --> 21:20.020
way of Eagle Pass, and then to Laredo. to Laredo and 
then from Laredo moved to Eagle Pass again. He

21:25.241 --> 21:40.965
wanted to stay away from all this and then lived in 
Eagle Pass for some time until the revolution

21:25.241 --> 21:40.965
ended and come here and then lease the subsoil to 
the American company and then got good money for

21:25.241 --> 21:40.965
rentals. And then the livestock business, he was a 
good businessman. But he apparently never wanted

21:46.578 --> 21:50.524
to go back to Mexico after. After Guarno, he stayed 
here. He managed, his boys, sons managed the

21:52.867 --> 21:56.352
ranch. Well, he was very lucky not to be killed, 
wasn't he? That's right, because they pulled the

22:00.558 --> 22:04.945
strings and then moved him to Monterey. This Pan 
American Highway crosses the ranch in the middle.

22:10.653 --> 22:13.497
It's about 40 miles from here. where the ranch was 
divided into parts. Between his sons? His

22:20.651 --> 22:21.472
children. His children now have it. It was about 
20,000 acres. Now where do his children live?

22:32.452 --> 22:36.700
Well, some of them, there remain only one, two,

22:39.093 --> 22:39.454
Three. Three children, grown-ups already. All 
the others, I guess there were eight in the family.

22:45.763 --> 22:47.265
All the other men have died. And then there are 
about three women that are already married and

22:47.986 --> 22:52.993
live here in Laredo. So now the land belongs to the 
grandchildren. No, to his own children. To his own

23:01.084 --> 23:02.166
children. And then they sold it to somebody else. 
Oh, I see. It has been divided for them. But what I

23:09.147 --> 23:18.605
say is that he made a big mistake in selling this 
land here out of loyalty to go to Mexico. You think

23:19.968 --> 23:24.176
he felt like it just wasn't right to own land in the 
United States or what? No, no. He want to go to

23:24.817 --> 23:26.079
Mexico. I see. And then he got to sell the land here. 
Well, how had he happened to move up here in the

23:29.971 --> 23:33.280
first place? That's why I say Guerrero has had a big 
influence. People from Guerrero owned ranches

23:36.931 --> 23:38.816
here. I see. And had owned ranches. Many 
old-timers from Laredo came from Guerrero and

23:40.601 --> 23:44.773
owned ranches here. I see. And they'd owned 
ranches here since way back... Way back. More than

23:49.705 --> 23:51.307
200 years ago. I see. So they... Let me tell you that 
priest, uncle or great-granddaughter, was the

23:52.688 --> 24:01.317
only one surveying all this. What did they call 
this land? They divided from the river so much

24:05.561 --> 24:12.108
frontage. I don't know how many, five or ten 
thousand varas, and then they got 10,000 varas

24:15.095 --> 24:20.703
back. Everyone, all the lands, the grants, had 
access to the river. And then later on had been

24:26.933 --> 24:29.156
subdivided. And then that priest is the one who 
made all these surveys. Who surveyed all the

24:33.322 --> 24:34.844
porciones? Porciones. Porciones. So most of 
these porciones were owned by people who lived in

24:39.260 --> 24:43.386
Guerrero. And here in Laredo too, the grants by 
that Captain Sanchez that founded Laredo. That's

24:52.941 --> 24:55.145
a funny story about Captain Sanchez. Many people 
claim that they are descendants of Sanchez. It

24:59.471 --> 25:01.234
happened that Sanchez never married.

25:05.568 --> 25:07.290
Well, did he have children? That's what I say. He 
had many children, but he never married. They are

25:12.417 --> 25:14.239
proud to be the sons of God. He never married. Oh, 
well. You can verify that from certain people. How

25:20.347 --> 25:21.108
did he marry? He never married. But he was a good 
man. He had a lot of kids. That's very interesting.

25:32.354 --> 25:36.363
I knew he had children, but I didn't know he'd never 
married. Were his children just by one wife, or did

25:36.804 --> 25:41.655
he just have children all over the place? Several 
women. Very interesting man. He was a fairly

25:45.102 --> 25:50.053
wealthy man, wasn't he, Captain Sanchez? Well, in 
that time wealth was measured by land and

25:50.168 --> 25:55.215
livestock. Cows, horses, goats, that's how the 
wealth was measured. Where did they sell their

26:03.186 --> 26:05.589
stock back in those days? The livestock, how did 
they sell it? They shipped it to San Antonio by land

26:07.792 --> 26:13.560
and then from San Antonio down to Ecuador. And then 
they had goats here. Did they ever move it south,

26:17.698 --> 26:20.121
further south? No, not to Mexico. Mexico didn't 
need them. They produced enough. But at that time a

26:26.670 --> 26:30.215
coal steer was worth $30.

26:32.618 --> 26:37.725
And they used to kill them just to salvage the skin, 
the hide.

26:40.355 --> 26:43.339
Well, it's changed a little bit now, hasn't it? No, 
the steak is worth it. Thirty dollars? Well, not

26:46.062 --> 26:51.248
quite that much, but steak for a family is about... 
It's big enough. They are going to, for stealing

26:51.829 --> 26:57.075
steaks from the supermarket. Oh, are they? Well, 
what about meat prices in Mexico now? Have they

27:03.503 --> 27:04.344
gone up? Meat is scarce in Mexico. You see, when we 
came here, meat was nine cents a pound. Very cheap.

27:14.326 --> 27:16.348
But there were no jobs or anything. There were no 
automobiles. Just these carriages, course

27:18.171 --> 27:23.457
carriages. Then they had an electric streetcar 
that went to the cemetery.

27:31.367 --> 27:36.653
It crossed the street from the east to west and then 
to the cemetery.

27:39.873 --> 27:41.635
So things have changed quite a bit. Life has 
changed. Well, how do you feel? Are you glad that

27:46.282 --> 27:49.666
the revolution came and you came here? I said, are 
you glad that the revolution happened and you

27:49.967 --> 27:56.716
ended up coming to this side? For me, it has been a 
good life. Good life.

28:03.926 --> 28:05.408
Well, I thank you very much.
