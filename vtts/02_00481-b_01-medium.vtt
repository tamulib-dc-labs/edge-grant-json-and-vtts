WEBVTT

00:31.013 --> 00:32.335
on the backside there.

00:35.580 --> 00:36.261
Oh, I see. And that's the way the thing worked.

00:42.931 --> 00:44.553
And I kept going on.

00:53.206 --> 00:54.067
Taking courses. Taking courses. Now, were these 
basically correspondence courses? These were

00:58.273 --> 01:00.356
correspondence courses. That's correct. up 
until, here's the order, sending me to Fort Sill

01:00.983 --> 01:13.758
for 90 days

01:00.983 --> 01:13.758
to take what they call a battery officer's course. 
And when was that? This is September

01:14.779 --> 01:24.551
16, 1938. Why 1938?

01:31.190 --> 01:35.237
Well, I was interested in qualifying myself. I was 
given a second lieutenant's commission when I got

01:36.138 --> 01:39.804
out of A&M. But I finished with certain grade 
points in ROTC. And I got interested in

01:44.512 --> 01:51.964
associating with these people as a second 
lieutenant. And we went down to Fort Sam, or out to

01:52.044 --> 01:57.172
Camp Bullis, for our two weeks active training. 
Sure. Every summer? Every summer. I didn't miss a

01:59.911 --> 02:06.179
summer until I went to Fort Sill in 1940, 
permanently.

02:09.104 --> 02:11.948
I was qualifying myself and I could see myself 
progressing. I was getting something out of it and

02:12.709 --> 02:15.212
having a lot of fun with it. And so I, at that time I 
was a bachelor and just something to tie into and

02:16.574 --> 02:25.046
do. And I did. And

02:28.801 --> 02:38.310
here's where I got my certificate of capacity to a 
captain. And

02:38.350 --> 02:43.485
he followed this whole thing right to

03:00.222 --> 03:06.230
Here's another one of our OTC officers down there. 
He

03:06.290 --> 03:14.680
finally made General Officer Aldridge Squirrel 
Tooth Aldridge. That's where he was telling me

03:16.503 --> 03:26.415
that they had sent my promotion, recommendation, 
a motion to a captain to the War Department.

03:33.702 --> 03:40.290
Here's where I was promoted to Captain in the 
Reserves, effective July 26, 1939.

03:43.353 --> 03:52.424
Would you consider giving these personal papers 
eventually to the archives at Texas A&M? Well,

03:52.444 --> 03:57.470
when I die, I will them to them.

03:57.650 --> 03:58.531
Certainly not now. I haven't thought about it. The 
archivist, who is my boss, would be very happy to

04:02.238 --> 04:08.649
have these in the permanent collection. They only 
pertain to me and the others that are on the same

04:08.669 --> 04:16.061
orders. But that's exactly what we're after. 
That's what archives do, collect personal

04:18.545 --> 04:24.756
papers.

04:24.776 --> 04:26.018
And of course, I was wondering about the 
conditions inside the reserve units. Did you men

04:33.579 --> 04:38.466
get paid for being a reservist then? We got paid in 
the sense that when we went to active duty, we got

04:38.926 --> 04:47.699
second lieutenant and first lieutenants paid for 
fourteen days. And they paid our transportation

04:48.740 --> 04:52.005
down and back. You didn't get paid for any weekend 
assignments or any week, every Thursday night?

04:58.057 --> 04:58.939
Every Thursday night, no. All you do is you've got 
credit for doing that correspondence work. And

05:04.847 --> 05:18.668
ultimately, you were rewarded, certainly not in 
the concept of the thing at that time, but

05:22.512 --> 05:25.636
You built up longevity by time. Every Thursday 
night was one point. This is something that came

05:29.342 --> 05:33.227
along later, and we had no conception of it at that 
time. And this has all come about, I guess, after

05:34.008 --> 05:44.163
the war of active duty points in calculating 
retirement. And I guess the Reserve Officers

05:45.144 --> 05:50.832
Association had

05:51.571 --> 06:04.173
much impact on it of influencing the army that set 
the system up to give credit for those inactive

05:51.571 --> 06:04.173
days. Because in calculating my retirement pay, I 
got credit for those Thursday nights and those two

06:05.715 --> 06:14.811
weeks that we went to camp. Then it was unknown, but 
it was a recognition. This came about after the

06:22.015 --> 06:25.201
Second World War, but before that it was unknown. 
That's right, it was unknown. In other words, you

06:26.503 --> 06:28.167
were not doing it. There was no real financial 
benefit whatsoever for being in the reserves. No.

06:32.816 --> 06:33.637
Like there is today. No.

06:39.850 --> 06:43.476
Here's my order to call them to active duty. I'm 
just looking at this thing. Okay, you were called

06:45.359 --> 06:49.065
to active duty in what, 1940? Yeah, December 29, 
1940. And

06:53.212 --> 07:03.910
Appy was, just looking at these now, Appy was 
Oklahoma A&M boy, Oklahoma University. Fanning

07:06.142 --> 07:08.185
was, I think, Oklahoma. Fleet was A&M. Jim Kerr was 
A&M. Kidd was A&M. And Kendrick was A&M. So four out

07:15.595 --> 07:20.863
of six on that order were Texas A&M.

07:25.209 --> 07:25.890
Artillerymen.

07:29.695 --> 07:30.917
Those were all artillery. All of us went up to Fort 
Sill together. What were your feelings when you

07:33.282 --> 07:37.386
were called into the active duty in 1940? Well, I 
was working, had a job, and my feelings were that

07:37.466 --> 07:59.166
because of the national

07:37.466 --> 07:59.166
or international situation, Hitler was running a 
merc that Our very stability of our country was at

08:00.698 --> 08:08.569
stake, and it was my job to go do what I could. I was 
happy for the qualification I had, meaning I had

08:08.589 --> 08:16.960
prepared myself now. I didn't know what I was 
preparing for, but I was preparing myself, in that

08:17.000 --> 08:23.890
I could do a better job for them. I was obsessed with 
the fact that I was going to defend my country. I

08:30.280 --> 08:33.023
felt that I could do a better job for my training. 
And back then, I couldn't put it in those words. I

08:38.688 --> 08:46.375
knew what I was trying to do of keeping current and 
qualifying myself if it ever happened. Well, when

08:46.415 --> 08:48.457
I got disordered, it did happen. And I

08:50.459 --> 09:00.068
am unqualified, unequivocally, you can say, that 
my training at A&M and my

09:00.588 --> 09:20.621
commission out of A&M gave me some breaks by Army 
officers that had been associated with A&M

09:00.588 --> 09:20.621
officers. And you got a break by being an A&M cadet 
or A&M officer. What do you mean? Can you give me an

09:27.986 --> 09:29.509
example of a break? What do you mean by a break? 
Well. They treated you better? No, you got a chance

09:34.576 --> 09:35.878
to. They gave you a responsibility. Oh, I see. 
Okay. And you got a chance to demonstrate your

09:39.424 --> 09:42.128
capabilities. Okay. I went up to Fort Seal in 
December 1940 and

09:43.890 --> 09:55.047
got assigned to, because of my rank, I was given a, a 
battery and school troops which do all the

09:55.567 --> 10:03.258
maneuvering and firing for the students there. 
And I stayed there about four months, five months,

10:03.278 --> 10:20.923
and then they had set up the replacement training 
center,

10:03.278 --> 10:20.923
artillery replacement training center. We 
trained

10:25.132 --> 10:30.698
We trained initial trainees and replacements.

10:30.718 --> 10:50.718
And the break I'm talking about is that because I 
was an A&M civil engineer, I was put in command by an

10:30.718 --> 10:50.718
old army colonel who had been associated with A&M 
cadets on this reserve training plane. And

10:52.780 --> 10:54.902
everyone that came in his command, He grabbed him 
and he personally assigned him. And he looked at my

10:59.589 --> 11:09.761
66-1, which is your personnel record card, this 
pink card here. And he looked at that and saw Texas

11:11.223 --> 11:14.908
A&M, civil engineer. And he said, Kidwell 
commands the instrument and survey battery.

11:23.458 --> 11:25.260
As such, we got all of the college graduates, 
draftees,

11:25.510 --> 11:33.781
who were engineers.

11:36.444 --> 11:43.153
And I taught them, my battery's job was to teach 
them artillery survey. Operating a plane table,

11:45.035 --> 11:54.808
operating a BC scope, operating a transit to 
survey in Sure. The artillery.

11:59.664 --> 12:01.747
And so that's the first thing that you did? That was 
the first thing after I got moved over there from

12:02.348 --> 12:10.099
this school troop battery. So this is the type of 
break that you're talking about? This is the type

12:13.925 --> 12:14.786
of break. In other words, he's given you an 
opportunity to prove, to make or break yourself.

12:19.193 --> 12:22.197
He gave me the opportunity to prove Because I 
wasn't getting the average draftee. I was getting

12:27.370 --> 12:31.876
all college boys or college graduates. If a 
draftee came in and he was studying any kind of

12:33.298 --> 12:40.068
engineering, he came to my battery. Because we 
were teaching them something. We taught them to

12:43.292 --> 12:48.679
figure firing data off of a slide rule, for 
instance. And a slide rule was brand new at that

12:49.120 --> 12:51.323
time. There were no calculators, but there were 
slide rules. And we taught them to figure firing

12:55.952 --> 13:02.421
data with slide rule. Well, to figure firing data, 
you got to know logarithms. And he came right on

13:07.347 --> 13:09.710
back to his college training seat. I got the finest 
soldiers that came in the Army and were assigned to

13:10.531 --> 13:16.138
the artillery. They came in my battery. And I made 
qualified capable soldiers out of them. And they

13:24.477 --> 13:27.301
went out and did their job. And because of that, I 
consistently got superior ratings on the type of

13:27.321 --> 13:45.468
soldier we were turning out, notwithstanding the 
fact that we had a high caliber person to start

13:27.321 --> 13:45.468
with. And some of them come on the other side of the 
tracks, and some of them come out of Brooklyn.

13:53.133 --> 13:54.174
Cross section of life. But I got the top of the 
cream. And I was able to mold those people into

13:59.640 --> 14:04.385
where every one of them were proficient when they 
left there. And we didn't have any discipline

14:05.386 --> 14:07.248
troubles. I mean, they wanted to do. They came in to 
learn something. And we gave it to them. And they

14:16.298 --> 14:18.540
went out and did their job. And that was our job to 
teach them. It was a good job. I had lots of fun with

14:23.808 --> 14:30.475
it, and I enjoyed it because I could see my 
accomplishments. How many did you teach? Tell me

14:32.337 --> 14:34.219
how it was set up. How long it was set up? Yeah. How 
long was the school? How was it set up? Well, they

14:39.585 --> 14:43.389
were there basically 12 weeks. They ran through a 
12-week cycle. Okay. And we had them three months.

14:47.773 --> 14:52.198
And, of course, the more proficient ones we'd send 
out in 10 weeks if they got a emergency

14:52.752 --> 14:56.696
requisition, they called it, a hurry-up call. 
Some outfit going overseas and they needed an

14:56.796 --> 15:04.684
instrument survey man or they needed a fire 
direction center man. We'd take the cream, the

15:06.766 --> 15:14.534
most astute student, the most applicable 
student, and learn the fastest. We'd give him a

15:15.195 --> 15:18.038
cram course at night and send him out. And this is 
something that Never been done in the Army before.

15:26.266 --> 15:27.527
Is this because of the war, then? Well, this was 
because of the emergency. It had to be accelerated

15:30.090 --> 15:31.912
because of the war, then? No, it had to be 
accelerated. We were given a man 12 weeks. And then

15:36.718 --> 15:43.526
we would have an emergency requisition because of 
some of them going to the Far East. I see. And then is

15:45.147 --> 15:50.974
when I took the attitude of having this night 
training also. to give him a cram course. And of

15:52.888 --> 16:03.338
course, it couldn't help it but be recognized by my 
battalion commander and my artillery commander.

16:03.899 --> 16:07.282
What did they think? Well, they liked the way it was 
progressing. And they kept up very close to it. And

16:13.688 --> 16:17.371
that's the break that I got because of this. See, I 
did an outstanding job with that battery. And I got

16:22.426 --> 16:24.469
to go to the field officer's course. The colonel, 
my regimental commander, got a requisition for

16:25.570 --> 16:42.794
two students to go to the field officer's course, 
which means qualifying you for a field officer,

16:25.570 --> 16:42.794
meaning a major or higher grade. And he had seen the 
work I'd done over there, and he knew that I'd go do a

16:45.017 --> 16:50.745
good job. He didn't want to send somebody over 
there that would bust the thing. It wouldn't be

16:53.887 --> 16:55.429
outstanding. Because his recommendations 
reflected on him. Couldn't help it. So he sent me as

17:00.995 --> 17:10.166
one of his

17:00.995 --> 17:10.166
recommended students, and I went over there. And I 
stood high in the academic class. Well, that's on

17:14.691 --> 17:16.613
the 66-1. And because of that, The next time, while 
I was at the field officer course, I got promoted to

17:20.965 --> 17:25.410
major. I don't remember when that was, but I got it. 
And that made you the battalion executive officer

17:30.436 --> 17:36.763
of the 8th Training Regiment? Yeah. When you were 
promoted to major? Yeah, I was, I got promoted to

17:44.132 --> 17:49.318
major and

17:51.982 --> 17:54.365
Major, 20th of June, 1942. Okay, okay. I was in the 
Army 18 months.

18:02.916 --> 18:04.558
Here it is, 19th of June, 1942. Here's my... 19th of 
June? That's what it says here. It says 20th here.

18:14.111 --> 18:17.235
Well, wait a minute. It's dated. It may be dated as 
of...

18:28.668 --> 18:32.415
Well, there it is. You weren't even a major a year 
before you were promoted to about ten months, and

18:32.815 --> 18:41.170
then you were promoted to lieutenant colonel. How 
can you account for that? That's an incredibly

18:44.676 --> 18:46.239
fast promotion. I'll tell you about that. But 
here's the 19th of June, and this is my promotion

18:47.741 --> 18:50.746
order. Okay, I'll just cross this off then. Date of 
rank is date of this order, unless otherwise

18:53.575 --> 18:58.601
specified, indicated after name. I'll put 19th. 
19th, yeah. So that's 19th of June. And it says date

19:06.750 --> 19:08.853
of this date.

19:14.419 --> 19:14.920
But anyway. How can you account for the fact that 
you were only a major 10 months? Well, I'll tell

19:20.486 --> 19:21.287
you. There again was a break, two breaks, and 
having been recognized, every

19:21.706 --> 19:40.491
job they gave me as a major, I did and excelled in it.

19:43.610 --> 19:44.391
And what job? The job was battalion executive 
officer, right? Battalion executive officer,

19:47.275 --> 19:53.123
and I believe I was S3 at part of the time. The S3, 
yeah, operations. Operations officer, and I was a

19:54.605 --> 20:03.216
summary court martial and all the added inspector 
jobs that you get. So what were your functions then

20:03.637 --> 20:08.403
as the battalion XO? Well, as battalion exec, you 
carry out the... battalion commander's orders or

20:14.120 --> 20:16.602
see if they're carried out. You do all the checking 
for him. He's the man who makes the decision, but

20:19.445 --> 20:22.108
you get him the information. And you check on your 
battery commanders. And you check his messes. You

20:27.152 --> 20:28.434
check his supplies. You check the bookkeeping. 
It's an executive job, meaning you do whatever the

20:31.877 --> 20:43.688
battalion commander desires, and you have no 
command. You have no command, but you are a

20:43.887 --> 20:52.820
representing commander, if that's a good way to 
put it. Okay, fine, fine. And there are your, the

20:56.826 --> 21:07.601
function of course of the battalion, was training 
there, artillery training. Your battalion S3 is

21:07.641 --> 21:10.666
your playing and training officer. As such, you 
have to get up the battalion training programs and

21:13.418 --> 21:21.614
see that your battery commanders have got their 
lesson plans for a certain lesson on a certain day.

21:22.475 --> 21:26.142
And you coordinate all the training and 
inspection of that training. And that eminently

21:27.545 --> 21:34.819
qualifies you from a training viewpoint.

21:34.934 --> 21:38.940
before you can inspect it or set it up, you've got to 
do it yourself. Absolutely. Now how many men, I

21:39.661 --> 21:48.375
know this is a difficult question, but here we are 
in 1942, approximately how many men were we

21:39.661 --> 21:48.375
training? Or in training? Yeah, how many young 
officers, most of these are second lieutenants,

21:50.959 --> 21:57.770
right, that you're training to be artillery 
officers? How many are in each class, or how did

21:58.591 --> 22:02.157
that work? Well, we were training them basically 
as instrument survey people, meaning battery

22:02.491 --> 22:18.792
fire direction centers, your battery surveyors 
and battalion surveyors, and your battalion fire

22:02.491 --> 22:18.792
direction people, which are all engineering 
jobs. And I commanded that battery for 18 months,

22:20.314 --> 22:30.568
and gosh, we ran through 250 on a 12-week

22:20.314 --> 22:30.568
cycle, three-month cycle. So we... Okay, so every 
class, and it was 250, and it was 12 weeks. Yeah, 12

22:37.105 --> 22:38.467
weeks, that's right. Okay, that's basically what 
I wanted to know then. That would be 18 divided

22:40.951 --> 22:47.660
by 3. If 12 weeks makes 3 months, it would be 6 times 
250, 1,500 people. So you were really keeping them

22:54.650 --> 22:56.633
moving through there. Had to, had to. Sure, you 
were, yeah. And I had to stay one jump ahead of them.

23:00.859 --> 23:01.540
Yeah. Believe you me. I was out there before they 
ever got up in the morning. I stayed until after we

23:04.378 --> 23:10.726
put them to bed every night, looking after my 
people, purely and simply looking after my

23:04.378 --> 23:10.726
people. And I tell you, looking after your people 
means to me, means seeing that everything goes

23:12.088 --> 23:17.115
right for them. For instance, one time I went out 
there at about 4.30 in the morning to check on the

23:17.155 --> 23:23.083
breakfast. The cooks had come in drunk that night 
before, 1.30 to 2 o'clock. going on to bed and

23:31.979 --> 23:38.346
sleeping and having a charge of quarters wake them 
up at 4.30 or 5 whenever they were supposed to get

23:31.979 --> 23:38.346
up. They cooked all the breakfast, eggs, made the 
biscuits and everything, fried eggs. Then they

23:46.456 --> 23:47.437
went to sleep. And I got there about 4.30, a quarter 
to 5, and saw all these cold fried eggs. And I went in

23:55.646 --> 24:01.513
and asked my charge of quarter, what the hell is 
happening? He didn't know. He said he knew the

24:04.299 --> 24:06.242
cooks were in there. He thought they were getting 
just preparatory work or something. He didn't

24:11.689 --> 24:12.970
know they cooked breakfast. Well, when I saw what 
happened, I went in and told his first sergeant

24:13.351 --> 24:22.563
what happened by that time he was up and around. And 
I told him to go ahead with Reveille

24:23.845 --> 24:33.357
and tell the men that breakfast would be late. And 
they'll go on about their chores. They'll clean up

24:35.627 --> 24:38.109
the barracks, do the police work and everything. 
We'd have breakfast at 7.30 so there could be a

24:38.149 --> 24:41.793
train at 8 o'clock. Well, of course, this so 
happened that the colonel drove through the area

24:43.955 --> 24:53.185
that morning checking Reveille.

24:56.348 --> 25:03.495
And we were, our schedule instead of being 
breakfast and all was also upset because it's

24:56.348 --> 25:03.495
breakfast business. And he stopped and came 
wanting to know what the hell was happening with my

25:04.876 --> 25:09.462
schedule. And I told him. And he says, I got it, 
Kidwell. I'm glad to see you're here. And I'm glad

25:19.274 --> 25:25.522
to know that you know that an army travels on their 
stomachs. Kidwell, he says, very early in life,

25:25.542 --> 25:29.347
and I'll give you the same lesson. If you give a man a 
good breakfast, he'll do you a good day's work.

25:34.213 --> 25:34.393
What? This is kind of bricks that I'm talking 
about. Sure, really. I impressed that old man. And

25:39.162 --> 25:44.909
so you're talking about being a major and why I was 
promoted to lieutenant colonel in a hurry. That

25:45.069 --> 25:47.772
was so fast, yeah.

25:50.976 --> 25:54.560
Why did they shift you to Fort Meade, Maryland? 
Well, wait a minute. Which was your second, which

25:55.241 --> 25:58.585
was after you left Fort Sill. Then you went to 
Maryland. Chronologically, you're skipping

25:59.686 --> 26:01.528
here. I don't know the notes that you have, but 
chronologically. This is what I got from your

26:07.538 --> 26:09.543
Westmoreland letter. Oh, well, yeah, there's a 
lot that I've left out. Oh, okay.

26:16.359 --> 26:19.045
I'm looking, I'm just thumbing through orders 
here now.

26:53.129 --> 26:55.111
You bet. Let me stop here.

27:03.640 --> 27:04.701
I'm looking for order here. Because of a lot of 
instances like this breakfast deal

27:07.204 --> 27:18.816
that I reiterated,

27:23.082 --> 27:24.945
Incidentally, what did you do to those cooks? I 
busted all of them and transferred them out on the

27:26.527 --> 27:35.560
next requisition for people. They had a cook's 
battery up there also.

27:45.254 --> 27:46.896
Here's what I was looking for. They had a cook's 
battery that taught raw recruits, Army cooking.

27:55.764 --> 27:57.625
And there again, it's 12 weeks. And the first time 
they got a requisition for some more men, well, I

27:58.066 --> 28:08.075
said, I'm going to mess all those cooks out on that 
requisition, because they were qualified cooks.

28:08.095 --> 28:09.096
They just goofed up once. They just got drunk and 
goofed up, and they had the wrong battery

28:09.116 --> 28:13.960
commander, as far as I was concerned. And I got rid 
of them. I busted them and shipped them out. The

28:21.858 --> 28:29.128
rail break that I got because of that cooking and 
lots of other instances like that. But on

28:30.030 --> 28:39.423
January 24, I got ordered to command and general 
staff school at Leavenworth. I don't remember

28:41.766 --> 28:48.937
whether that's in that thing or not.

28:48.957 --> 28:49.577
DAVID BURRAGE. 1943. January 1943, yeah. OK, I got 
it right up there. And why did they send you? To go to

29:02.114 --> 29:03.916
school. Yeah, but why you instead of somebody 
else? Because my regimental commander made the

29:06.338 --> 29:14.244
recommendation and sold it to the general that we 
worked for. And there again, he wanted to send

29:15.305 --> 29:20.890
somebody that he knew damn well would go up there 
and make a credible record. And I had impressed him

29:22.456 --> 29:24.959
with his breakfast business. As soon as I got

29:25.779 --> 29:40.134
going as a battery commander, you know, a battery 
earns money, dividends from post-exchange

29:25.779 --> 29:40.134
profits. And they give it to you. You can spend it on 
anything you want to spend it on, as long as for the

29:41.035 --> 29:45.480
benefit of all the men in that battery. Well, our 
mess hall up there was just a dismal, two before

29:52.190 --> 29:54.472
mess hall. And I got the idea of decorating it up. So 
I lined it with plywood and we painted it, as I

29:59.197 --> 30:06.565
remember, a soft green color. And it made a 
pleasant place to eat. And that was certainly a

30:10.348 --> 30:15.474
legitimate expenditure of post-exchange money. 
And an old man come by to inspect my mess and he saw

30:17.336 --> 30:20.779
all this work going on. He asked about it, and I told 
him what I was doing. He said, that's fine, that's

30:23.072 --> 30:24.153
fine. And he came back, and before it all over, why, 
half the mess halls up there were done that way,

30:25.294 --> 30:34.605
because those commanders would come by and see 
mine that way. Of course, they got to the general,

30:34.665 --> 30:37.988
and he commented about it, and they admired it. 
Well, all the rest of them wanted to do their same

30:38.889 --> 30:42.353
way, and that kind of thing.

30:46.438 --> 30:51.323
Another thing, they had sand and ultimately dirt 
walks up there. That's the way the camp was

30:53.330 --> 30:54.832
constructed. I knew something about concrete and 
there again we had this money so with my battery

30:55.793 --> 31:15.720
carpenter who did all the farm work and then we just 
got some people to help us if we wanted to, we poured

30:55.793 --> 31:15.720
concrete walks in the whole area. Well they did two 
things when they were going to the mess in the

31:16.641 --> 31:20.787
inclement weather, they their shines from 
getting messed up, kept mud off their feet,

31:21.374 --> 31:31.371
meaning they didn't track mud back into barracks 
and have to mop it again and all these kind of

31:21.374 --> 31:31.371
things. But old man saw that too. And I was always 
doing something like that to better take care of my

31:35.819 --> 31:43.051
soldiers. Wow. Okay. So he sent you up here? So he 
sent me to... And tell me about Command and General

31:47.217 --> 31:50.720
Staff School. Up at Command and General Staff 
School in January 1943. I

31:56.426 --> 32:06.415
had a good friend that went up there and came back in 
Class 11. I was in General Staff School 12, Class

32:07.296 --> 32:11.200
12. It was an accelerated... wartime course of 90 
days.

32:20.655 --> 32:23.979
And my friend was a school teacher, artilleryman. 
He had a company or battery next to mine. And we

32:29.344 --> 32:35.571
visited over a cup of coffee, our mutual problems 
in our areas, this kind of thing. And he went, he was

32:37.073 --> 32:39.715
there ahead of me. He came back and he said, now, 
Graber, I'm going to tell you how to get along up

32:44.517 --> 32:46.539
there. And I said, fine. That's what I'm 
interested in. There's two things you've got to

32:49.982 --> 32:51.304
do. You've got to study meticulously and keep your 
eyes and ears open during all the lectures, all

32:52.225 --> 33:04.117
lecture discussions. And I had some class 
participation, the basics of the lecture. They

33:09.502 --> 33:12.465
give you problems work, get out at nighttime, and 
you come back. They call on students to give their

33:12.766 --> 33:18.432
solutions to them in this country.

33:18.453 --> 33:23.699
You keep your eyes and ears open and take 
meticulous notes in the classroom. And as soon as

33:26.041 --> 33:29.165
you eat supper, you go back and start studying 
until 10 o'clock. And you go to bed and go to sleep.

33:33.450 --> 33:38.115
So the next day, you'll be alert and keep your eyes 
and ears open, take my notes. And then he pointed

33:40.357 --> 33:43.020
out one thing. He says that whenever they repeat 
something in your notes, you underline it,

33:43.060 --> 33:49.888
because it's coming back on pay quiz. They call 
them pay quizzes, on a test. And I meticulously did

33:54.253 --> 33:56.095
what he told me. I don't have it now, but I had all 
those books alphabetically listed, or indexed,

33:57.717 --> 34:10.212
so I could turn to the reference data like that. And 
you could use any manuals, any Army manuals you

34:11.272 --> 34:17.759
wanted on examination.

34:20.221 --> 34:26.068
Because the theory is, if you didn't know where to 
look for it, I mean, if you didn't know it, you

34:20.221 --> 34:26.068
didn't know where to look for it. And I had them all 
indexed like that. So if they wanted the train

34:28.430 --> 34:40.603
length of a quartermaster battalion, I could go to 
cues, and I had it in two or three seconds. and that

34:41.208 --> 34:44.792
gave me time to do something else and I had to stop 
and think about it. So you were extraordinarily

34:44.812 --> 34:46.994
well organized. I was well organized because the 
school teacher friend was there ahead of me and he

34:47.555 --> 34:52.340
told me what to do.

34:56.905 --> 35:04.092
And why I got promoted to lieutenant colonel so 
fast is I went up there and excelled again. You

35:04.312 --> 35:05.814
can't get away from that, excelling. I stood 
number 11 in a class of Over 800. Number, but that's

35:11.098 --> 35:13.520
tremendous. Number 11. And the reason I did it, 
they gave you these quizzes all, I don't know, once

35:16.183 --> 35:28.937
a week, once every two weeks, on particular 
subject, depending on how long the subject was.

35:31.300 --> 35:38.788
And then they give you a month quiz or six weeks quiz 
when they finish that subject, you know. And as I

35:40.726 --> 35:48.137
remember, I made all As but two, and they were Bs. 
And the first 10 probably made all As, I don't know.

35:51.302 --> 35:54.186
Or they made a better A than mine. As I remember, the 
A grade was 95 to 100, and B was 85 to 95, and C was 70 to

35:55.148 --> 36:08.708
85, and below C was a U, if you didn't make it. 70 or 
75, it was unsatisfactory. And I made all A's but

36:14.227 --> 36:16.049
two. Their A's may have been higher than mine, or 
they may have made A while I made a B. But anyway. But

36:23.676 --> 36:24.617
you did quite well. I was 11th, which is 
outstanding. Well, there again, that gets on the

36:27.820 --> 36:32.624
66-1 scene. Sure. And when the general, this is the 
first introduction you get to when you're you're

36:37.628 --> 36:42.996
assigned to his command, is you get this, this goes 
ahead of you. And he'll take it, or his, his exec,

36:44.659 --> 36:53.352
chief of staff will take it, and they'll go through 
here. That same old kid went to the NG&R course in

36:54.153 --> 37:06.252
38, he went to field officer's course and did so 
well in 42, and he did so well up at the CNGS, he's 11.

37:06.940 --> 37:08.982
in his class at CNJS in 43. Well, that earmarked me 
and gave me breaks. That's all a word you can say

37:13.967 --> 37:16.490
about it, gave me some breaks. Now, during this 
school, this command staff college, during this,

37:16.770 --> 37:26.159
what did they teach you? They teach you tactics and 
wartime tactics and strategies. strategic

37:35.071 --> 37:41.459
planning and tactical planning, pretty much 
anything. A.T. taught me how to maneuver armies

37:41.479 --> 37:54.595
and divisions and artillery groups as a 
commander. Tactics and strategies. So this would

37:55.837 --> 38:02.866
help, of course, this would help you get promotion 
too because they'd need somebody on the

37:55.837 --> 38:02.866
battlefield with this knowledge. That's right. 
There's no question about that. Okay. That equips

38:07.601 --> 38:09.544
you to do their job. And, you know, a tactical 
commander has a tremendous responsibility.

38:15.711 --> 38:17.894
Sure, absolutely. And he doesn't want an average 
person doing his command down below him. He wants

38:23.380 --> 38:33.833
to be able to call in a half dozen top flight 
commanders and say, I want this, or this is what

38:23.380 --> 38:33.833
we're going to do, and this is your job. And he 
doesn't want somebody stubbing their toe because

38:35.078 --> 38:39.024
it reflects on him. He's looking for four stars 
instead of three or something like this. And if

38:43.791 --> 38:49.359
they flub their dub down here in this operation, 
it's on his 66-1, not mine. You can't offer excuses

38:51.001 --> 38:53.044
on this thing, see. It's just cold turkey. And he's 
looking for somebody that he thinks can carry the

38:54.967 --> 39:01.356
ball. And this, after you had this school, then you 
were sent as the CO? Is that what happened next in

39:08.991 --> 39:10.773
the progression? You were sent as the CO, 17th 
Field Artillery Battalion, Fort Meade,

39:10.793 --> 39:15.118
Maryland? No, no. The next thing that happened, 
and I'll tell you this, I'm here today talking to

39:17.620 --> 39:30.955
you

39:17.620 --> 39:30.955
by a good friend of mine trying to, Rook me, you 
know. I won't say the word on that. He got out of

39:38.709 --> 39:39.650
Leavenworth. He and I were classmates up there. 
Mark Tellerman. And he came back and he didn't do so

39:43.013 --> 39:46.496
hot. So they put him over in personnel.

39:50.800 --> 39:53.723
And he didn't like that worth a damn. Of course, 
we're just in a holding station. After you get out

39:55.524 --> 40:01.009
of Leavenworth, they send you out to a senior unit 
meaning division or a major unit. Because you've

40:07.976 --> 40:14.946
got to train to do the job, as far as the Army's 
concerned, and they send you out there. And

40:16.549 --> 40:27.705
I had a very, well, General Potter, when he saw that 
I was 11 in class, he said, damn kid, well that's

40:16.549 --> 40:27.705
great, that's great. He said, I'll have you a job 
here some of these days real quick now that you'll

40:27.938 --> 40:33.525
like. Because he's always getting requisitions 
from the War Department for an officer of a certain

40:34.386 --> 40:43.718
caliber, of a certain training level.

40:44.479 --> 40:46.461
And I saw him one day at the officer club at lunch. He 
said, kiddo, I recommend you for a job today. You

40:50.907 --> 40:53.210
get your bags packed, boy, because you're gone. 
Where am I going, gentlemen? Where am I going?

40:55.900 --> 40:57.221
Well, that don't make any difference. You just get 
your bags packed. See, I saw him a week later and

40:58.663 --> 41:03.829
said, General, I got my bags packed. I'm still 
around. He says, Well, this is a stole. Hold tight.

41:09.475 --> 41:10.957
Just keep your bitches on. I think he told me. And so 
I stayed there two, three, four more days. I saw him

41:18.806 --> 41:21.970
again over at the office a couple of nights. He 
said, I thought you were gone. I'm waiting on some

41:25.853 --> 41:26.994
orders. He says, well, I saw some orders for you to 
go yesterday. I'm by the office when I get back. And

41:38.146 --> 41:43.011
this is all in retrospect now, what happened. And 
he told me what, he would never tell me the job

41:43.031 --> 41:46.554
before that, then he told me. What happened was 
this friend of mine in personnel The general sent

41:55.722 --> 41:59.206
my name up there to go on this order. It was a top 
secret deal. And he could see himself getting out

42:02.851 --> 42:07.616
of this country in a matter of 24 hours. He inserted 
his name for my name. Notwithstanding the fact

42:12.903 --> 42:25.037
that he didn't foresee the ultimate

42:12.903 --> 42:25.037
damage that could be done to his army career or his 
career. Because if they'd ever caught it, and

42:25.743 --> 42:32.510
they'd have caught it sooner or later, well, 
they'd have crucified him. But anyway. Did they

42:33.311 --> 42:35.373
catch him? The answer is no. Why not? How could they 
not catch him? OK. The general knew you were

42:39.898 --> 42:41.499
supposed to go. That's right. He went up to Andrews 
Air Force Base and got with this group of officers.

42:48.286 --> 42:54.653
They were in a plane going to Portugal to stage on a 
top secret mission going in to lay in the man work

42:54.886 --> 43:02.416
for the American Army to go into North Africa. His 
plane went down three or four miles off of Portugal

43:03.277 --> 43:08.163
and they were all lost. So you were lucky. So I'm 
alive today because that son of a bitch tried to,

43:11.267 --> 43:17.675
well did, rip me. But the job was, General Potter 
told me later, that I was going to be the artillery

43:24.029 --> 43:42.947
representative with General Clark, Mark Clark, 
went into North Africa in a submarine with a bunch

43:24.029 --> 43:42.947
of gold and all to get with the Free French and set up 
the Free French to give us a place to land in North

43:24.029 --> 43:42.947
Africa.

43:43.108 --> 43:52.737
And that whole kit and caboodle was lost because 
the airplane

43:43.108 --> 43:52.737
went down. And of course, General Clark was 
already there in Portugal, and that's just one of

43:54.134 --> 44:01.148
those things. But I'm here today because he did 
that. Well, anyway, that fizzled. That fizzled.

44:10.347 --> 44:11.128
That definitely fizzled. That fizzled as far as I 
was concerned. It made a good way for you. Yeah,

44:13.694 --> 44:15.417
that's right, as far as I was concerned. That 
fizzled, but then I went up to Fort Meade. Okay, as

44:20.663 --> 44:25.148
the CO of the 17th Field Artillery Division. Yeah. 
As a lieutenant colonel. As a lieutenant colonel.

44:27.591 --> 44:31.355
I was promoted lieutenant colonel on April 6, 
1943. And

44:31.395 --> 44:38.063
when did you arrive there at Fort Meade? Well, I'll 
tell you. Probably about the same time. A little

44:40.926 --> 44:41.607
later.

45:23.707 --> 45:25.355
There's another school I went to. I don't know 
whether that's on my mind. But I went to Tanker Star

45:29.837 --> 45:31.405
School.

46:09.370 --> 46:16.942
It was four batteries, typical artillery 
battalion. I went up there in July of 43.

46:19.346 --> 46:26.298
Approximately

46:19.346 --> 46:26.298
how many men and how much artillery? Well, a 
battalion is four batteries, approximately

46:38.530 --> 46:43.616
100 to 110 or 15 men, about 425 men total. How much 
artillery? Well, you've got three gun batteries

46:46.339 --> 46:59.553
and headquarters battery, 12 guns, and

46:46.339 --> 46:59.553
that's standard battery. OK. And what did you do it 
for at Meaden? We did training work. Oh, training

47:05.139 --> 47:05.820
work. A big part? More training. More training 
work. A similar job to what you had at Fort

47:09.118 --> 47:12.308
Sullivan. That's exactly correct. We were on a 
training mission.
