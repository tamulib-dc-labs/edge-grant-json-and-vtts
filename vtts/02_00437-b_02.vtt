WEBVTT

00:04.975 --> 00:06.837
I just know a lot of hours a day. So after a lot of 
discussion, they did give me a few hours of credit

00:07.617 --> 00:24.532
for some of my military experience, like in the 
basic requirements, there was some military

00:07.617 --> 00:24.532
requirements that they'd give me credit for had I 
gone into ROTC, so nationally qualified. So they

00:24.792 --> 00:34.560
did give me a few hours, but still, it was 
impossible for me to get, they said, a necessary

00:24.792 --> 00:34.560
number of hours for a degree in electrical 
engineering. talked in terms of, well, why can't

00:34.777 --> 00:40.162
it take more of these courses? And he said, well, 
you're talking in terms of 28 hours. Well, I think I

00:45.046 --> 00:46.167
can do this. I've got nothing else to do. And I 
finally prevailed upon him to let me try it. And we

00:54.454 --> 00:58.477
said, well, OK, we'll try this. And I started out. 
And it was, I assure you, a laborious undertaking.

01:04.747 --> 01:05.949
extremely hard at first. Three or four o'clock in 
the morning, I was still busy. And they gave me a

01:10.415 --> 01:29.083
little bit of freedom to go in and register early in 
order to get the classes before they filled up at

01:10.415 --> 01:29.083
the property, to be sure I'd take advantage of the 
hours at a certain time of the day for a particular

01:10.415 --> 01:29.083
class that I needed to have. So they were very, very 
cooperative and helpful, very understanding,

01:29.103 --> 01:34.230
and I started out. And that's the way I went for the 
first year, straight through, all the year, for 12

01:34.615 --> 01:42.185
months, summer and all. And so at the end of 12 
months, how many credits did you get? Well, I had

01:44.888 --> 01:51.316
the equivalent of two years of credits towards an 
electrical engineering degree. At the end of 12

01:51.396 --> 01:52.798
months, you had two years. At the end of 12 months. 
And I think I'd made, well, a practice grade A. I

01:54.260 --> 02:02.651
think I'd made one B, or one B, grade A courses. So 
they were... Now, all of the people that knew me,

02:04.585 --> 02:09.671
and professors, and the heads of the various 
schools knew me. They were ecstatic. And they

02:11.013 --> 02:14.297
showed me this congratulating, encouraged me. 
But the head of the School of Electrical

02:14.837 --> 02:19.002
Engineering, I forget his name right now. It's 
been so long ago. What, 40 years? Well, almost 40

02:21.686 --> 02:24.149
years ago.

02:26.151 --> 02:33.580
He said, there's no way that we could continue, 
particularly since you start getting into lab

02:26.151 --> 02:33.580
courses, direct current and electrical power, 
since A&M stressed that. And there's just no way

02:39.600 --> 02:44.204
I'd get enough hours and couldn't possibly get a 
degree in two years. So to make a long story short, I

02:46.567 --> 02:55.035
collaborated with more of the officials in school 
and then also my headquarters back at Terry

02:46.567 --> 02:55.035
University. And upon a suggestion of them and 
giving me complete freedom, I sat down with the

02:55.055 --> 03:03.263
officials of A&M and ended up taking orienting my 
work toward a degree. And at that time, it was

03:06.278 --> 03:10.524
called management engineering, I think now 
called investment engineering. And I'm

03:10.544 --> 03:19.956
delighted I did, because it gave me the 
opportunity to get my degree in the time allotted.

03:20.056 --> 03:24.822
Plus, since I'd done so well, they knew I was 
motivated back home in their university. They

03:24.902 --> 03:27.245
granted me another four years, one more semester. 
Four months. Four months, one more semester to get

03:27.866 --> 03:33.233
my degree. I started in again, and the same number 
of hours, and at the end of two years and four

03:33.685 --> 03:49.164
months, I had gotten my degree in management 
engineering and graduated with honors. I was a

03:49.184 --> 03:57.354
member of the Tau Beta Pi and National Honor 
Society, and I didn't participate in any other

03:49.184 --> 03:57.354
activities. I'd have loved to have participated 
in football, but of course I couldn't. the work. I

04:05.913 --> 04:12.703
was dedicated to it and I was doing well and I was 
achieving my objective. It was extremely hard on

04:14.084 --> 04:18.551
my wife, my two little girls, extremely hard. But 
we got through it and of course the officials back

04:18.571 --> 04:31.468
there at the university were elated and I got high 
marks for my achievement in getting a degree.

04:32.140 --> 04:35.805
And I must admit that I was very, very proud that I 
didn't pick A&M. I'm still proud of it. That's

04:37.308 --> 04:44.879
where I wanted to go when I was a kid, and then I 
finally achieved that objective, and I have the

04:37.308 --> 04:44.879
Air Force to thank for that. When you were younger, 
you had an idea of what it would be like. You had a

04:49.726 --> 04:57.237
perception of A&M, and then you didn't get to go to 
college for a decade after, or 15 years later. In

04:57.942 --> 05:04.149
what ways was your earlier perception of A&M 
correct, and in which way was it incorrect? Well,

05:04.289 --> 05:06.531
that's a good question. I can say I was about 32 when 
I started in 47. And

05:11.296 --> 05:26.532
here I was a full colonel, dedicated in having a 
full military career to go back to immediately

05:11.296 --> 05:26.532
when I was leaving college. It's sort of like 
somebody in a corporation of business being given

05:26.798 --> 05:36.011
two years to go get a degree then come back to a job in 
a corporation. I knew I had a job. There was no

05:38.374 --> 05:43.041
reason for me not to concentrate strictly on 
studying. That was my objective.

05:45.725 --> 05:49.630
Extracurricular activities was out of the 
question. I didn't have any desire to do that. But

05:51.773 --> 05:56.400
here I was cast in that type of environment and 
considerably older than You know, the other

05:56.482 --> 06:01.569
students in their late teens and a few maybe in 
their early 20s. A few graduate types that I

06:01.589 --> 06:19.894
mingled with, but nobody, hardly anybody at my age 
level except a couple, two or three colonels,

06:01.589 --> 06:19.894
lieutenant colonels about my age in the same 
program from the United States Army and the United

06:01.589 --> 06:19.894
States Air Force. I mixed easily. with the 
professors in the classes. They became very

06:28.709 --> 06:35.395
helpful and knew what I was doing, and we had a very 
high mutual respect for each other. The

06:37.197 --> 06:44.023
professors never singled me out one way or the 
other to either discriminate or to give

06:37.197 --> 06:44.023
preference. I guess I was another student. The 
students, by far the majority of the students,

06:54.363 --> 06:57.488
respected me and realized what I was doing. As 
usual in a group of people that big, you always have

06:58.128 --> 07:04.578
some eight balls as far as I'm concerned. I can 
recall two or three that taunted me. Really?

07:09.685 --> 07:10.707
Taunted me considerably. Gee, I wish I had your set 
up, a full colonel doing a full colonel's pay and

07:11.548 --> 07:18.238
going to school. Actually, you don't even have to 
study. Two or three of the types of this nature,

07:23.067 --> 07:28.314
obviously you can imagine what type of people they 
were. I doubt they even finished their studying.

07:31.058 --> 07:32.701
And this bothered me for a while. These were kids in 
the Corps? No, not in the Corps. They were not

07:35.905 --> 07:37.347
members of the ROTC. They were veterans? No, none 
of them were veterans. They were just young kids.

07:44.518 --> 07:48.523
Did you wear your uniform to class? No, I never wore 
my uniform. I, on weekends, I still had to give a

07:52.632 --> 08:02.887
flying time and maintain my flying pay and my 
capability to fly. Weekend, all the pilots of the

08:04.029 --> 08:08.355
group would be about three or four of us. Some of 
them were not pilots. But we who were pilots would

08:10.298 --> 08:20.333
get in a car and drive over to Burge to Murfreespace 
in Austin, Texas, and fly our aircraft for, ready

08:10.298 --> 08:20.333
to fly at least four hours a month. Generally what 
we would do, be three or four of us come over and get

08:22.805 --> 08:46.795
in a transport aircraft on a Saturday afternoon 
and just get in the airplane and schedule hops that

08:22.805 --> 08:46.795
would take us all night long and up to about noon on 
Sunday, flying time, where we'd change its

08:22.805 --> 08:46.795
controls of the aircraft so that by the time all of 
us got back, all of us would have at least four hours

08:22.805 --> 08:46.795
in the airplane. So it had to require at least eight 
to 12 hours flying time. That's the way we'd do

08:50.834 --> 08:51.875
that. How many hours a month did you have to have? 
Four hours. Basically four hours. And this was

08:56.920 --> 09:01.665
still required while we were going to college.

09:02.646 --> 09:04.948
Why didn't you wear your uniform? They preferred 
we do not. Oh, the Air Force? It was not a

09:07.891 --> 09:09.732
regulation. Well, almost a regulation, yes. It 
was one of our guidelines. Go in civilian clothes

09:14.377 --> 09:20.503
mixed with the student body and don't be obvious. 
In other words, there was expected to be some

09:21.850 --> 09:26.116
criticism. Maybe the Air Force would spend money 
sending the guys to school and they would be out

09:27.037 --> 09:34.107
training in the military. I think this was the 
basis of some of the toning that I got from one or two

09:34.127 --> 09:39.034
of the kids. How did you get along with the kids in 
the Corps? Excellent. As a matter of fact, it so

09:42.338 --> 09:50.710
happened that my brother, my youngest brother, 
actually I paid his way through A&M at the time. He

09:51.297 --> 10:04.153
was in the cadet corps, and after, you know, even 
that first year, word got around who I was, his

09:51.297 --> 10:04.153
brother and so forth, and I got along fine. Matter 
of fact, we had, you know, the air PMS&T, and many

10:04.173 --> 10:17.811
times we got together and we had dinner together 
and I associated with them, you know, military,

10:04.173 --> 10:17.811
professional military service. Sometimes I even 
went over and gave maybe a lecture. to some of the

10:21.368 --> 10:23.691
students at RMTC.

10:27.074 --> 10:47.798
The one thing I observed that was very, in effect, 
was educational to me, really in a philosophical

10:27.074 --> 10:47.798
way, was, you know, at this time there were many 
veterans going to colleges, and A&M with the

10:27.074 --> 10:47.798
freedom they had, not only in education, but in 
Very informal dress and all. Veteran not having to

10:52.607 --> 11:01.440
take ROTC, of course, and many of them, and I mean 
hundreds of thousands of them at this time in the

10:52.607 --> 11:01.440
program. Some married with a baby, living in 
trailers, actually provided trailer space on the

11:01.701 --> 11:11.075
campus back by the Kyle Field for them to live in. 
These guys knew what they were going to school for.

11:17.343 --> 11:21.388
They were, many of them were matured by, you know, 
combat. Their attitude was remarkably different

11:22.449 --> 11:28.697
in college towards their education. And, well not 
surprisingly, might be as you'd expect it, they

11:28.717 --> 11:33.883
were A students. And it led me to believe that, do 
some soul searching about our American system of

11:35.265 --> 11:46.118
education, particularly time wise and the life of 
a young man. And quite often I thought, goodness,

11:46.553 --> 12:14.822
as long as we have the draft, why not think in terms 
of trying to induce a young man to put a year or two of

11:46.553 --> 12:14.822
service in right after high school, and take 
advantage of the maturing and ripening process in

11:46.553 --> 12:14.822
military service amongst men, and then at one 
moment release him from the service. let him go to

12:15.612 --> 12:20.638
college, and perhaps even help him pay part of his 
college. I still think this is what he looked at.

12:25.164 --> 12:38.481
Because so many students, and backed up by many 
discussions I had with the professors along these

12:25.164 --> 12:38.481
lines, just the average high school graduate that 
came to college just didn't know what he wanted to

12:25.164 --> 12:38.481
do. in a lot of areas just wasn't educated well 
enough either to start taking up a college, like

12:39.220 --> 12:45.166
college algebra. He couldn't take college 
algebra. As a matter of fact, A&M did have

12:46.608 --> 12:52.654
refresher courses in algebra. So it was a, I 
learned a lot in the field of education, if you

12:52.674 --> 12:58.200
will. What about your professors? Were there any 
that you thought, well, they were special in any

12:59.701 --> 13:04.987
way to you, that helped you in any way? Do you 
remember any of them? Oh yeah, I remember a fact

13:07.469 --> 13:12.175
that I can close my eyes and see many of them right 
now. Names-wise, I can't remember all the names. I

13:17.782 --> 13:32.380
remember Dr. Perry, the head of the School of 
Management Engineering, who was a very fine man

13:17.782 --> 13:32.380
and who did everything he could to anything I 
wanted to do within reason, he would readily

13:17.782 --> 13:32.380
approve of. He was instrumental in granting me the 
authority to take so many hours. The young fellow

13:39.153 --> 13:48.846
who was head of mechanical drawing in the freshman 
course, a real young fellow, he had had some

13:39.153 --> 13:48.846
military service. He was very helpful in 
understanding.

13:53.707 --> 14:06.161
All of them, without exception, were readily 
available to me to talk to about any particular

13:53.707 --> 14:06.161
time, particularly making adjustments or a 
32-year-old man coming back to college, you know,

13:53.707 --> 14:06.161
and practically every one of them. Well, I'd say 
50% of them, maybe 70% of them, were younger than I.

14:14.970 --> 14:23.680
My physics professor was a, I guess what you call 
him, a paraplegic, not a paraplegic, he was a...

14:31.388 --> 14:35.994
relatively young man, and extremely brilliant in 
physics. And remember, we busted the atom bomb.

14:39.538 --> 14:42.682
But it had impact on the teaching of physics. Some 
of the books had to be. And they were just

14:45.325 --> 14:50.712
introducing an atomic physics course at A&M about 
the time I started school. And he was a very

14:51.733 --> 14:55.778
understanding type of person. But he was one of 
these spastic types that was physically very at a

15:01.814 --> 15:11.145
terrible disadvantage, particularly writing on 
a wall, on a slate and chalk.

15:13.047 --> 15:16.171
And I remember him because I felt sorry for him. He 
had such a disadvantage, but yet here he was

15:16.191 --> 15:24.040
teaching students, and that gentleman finally 
committed suicide.

15:25.622 --> 15:30.167
One of my statistical

15:32.594 --> 15:35.198
data statistics course in management 
engineering. That gentleman may still be at A&M. I

15:38.562 --> 15:38.943
don't know. I can't remember his name. He was very 
helpful, a relatively young guy. And he took

15:42.768 --> 15:56.007
special time out to help me on a new type of 
mathematics I'd never been concerned with,

15:42.768 --> 15:56.007
permutations and probabilities. What do you 
think of the training? I mean, the academic

15:57.750 --> 16:02.196
training that you received at A&M, do you think it 
was adequate? Was it good, mediocre, average?

16:05.040 --> 16:08.044
What do you think? When you say academic training, 
you mean actually the instructing I got? No, the

16:12.249 --> 16:13.911
quality of the instruction. Outstanding. 
Outstanding. Outstanding. And I can't think of a

16:16.254 --> 16:24.885
single- Did it prepare you for a career if you 
wanted to go into engineering management, if you

16:16.254 --> 16:24.885
want industrial engineering? I'm glad you asked 
that question. All the professors, and to a

16:28.636 --> 16:44.519
certain extent I remember students even being 
interested in my question, because I'd ask a

16:28.636 --> 16:44.519
question pertaining to how I visualize it in the 
future and applying it maybe to, let's say,

16:28.636 --> 16:44.519
strictly the military, like a course in handling 
people. Industrial relations, you know, maybe

16:46.181 --> 16:53.091
I'd ask a question about the officers versus the 
airmen rather than management versus labor. The

16:53.257 --> 16:58.484
professors were actually delighted with the 
question because it was a strange question to

16:53.257 --> 16:58.484
them. But it was outstanding.

17:06.313 --> 17:16.726
Now, I was wondering about some of the so-called 
traditions that we have at A&M and what your

17:06.313 --> 17:16.726
opinion was of them. One is hazing. Of course, you 
weren't.

17:25.808 --> 17:32.159
in an official manner, but you must have seen some 
of the hazing and some of the spanking and things

17:25.808 --> 17:32.159
like that. What was your opinion of this? Well, 
remember I'd been through the Flying Cadets.

17:36.927 --> 17:37.708
Sure. And they had a very, very similar type of 
hazing program in the Flying Cadets. In some ways,

17:43.157 --> 17:51.411
a little bit more drastic than what I observed 
during the time I was at A&M. I didn't mind that. I

17:53.431 --> 18:07.452
wasn't against it, and I don't know, I accepted it 
as part of the tradition of Texas A&M and as a method

17:53.431 --> 18:07.452
of seeing if the young guy, when he came to A&M, if he 
could take it. And I wasn't against it. If it's

18:12.200 --> 18:17.668
overdone, where maybe a man was physically, if you 
will, torture a little bit.

18:21.715 --> 18:37.316
I also wanted to ask you now, during your years in 
the service, you must have met a number of West

18:21.715 --> 18:37.316
Point graduates, a number of Aggie officers, and 
of course, a number of Air Force Academy officers.

18:37.336 --> 18:45.246
And I'd like you to compare the quality of a second 
lieutenant from each one of these institutions.

18:47.530 --> 18:48.651
Compare them with each other. I've thought about 
that a lot, and actually, when I came across

18:50.842 --> 19:02.198
various graduates, I thought of the first 
question a lot. I can truthfully say I didn't see

19:02.559 --> 19:04.621
any difference. You couldn't really tell. Even on 
the second lieutenant? No.

19:11.491 --> 19:19.262
Even allowing for my bias towards A&M because I was 
making graduates, I still would say It was equal.

19:23.789 --> 19:30.279
You put them up one against the other, and there was 
really no difference.

19:30.299 --> 19:47.785
The training at A&M, in my opinion, not having gone 
through Westmont, Indianapolis, or the Air Force

19:30.299 --> 19:47.785
Academy, I can't say positively, but I got the 
impression after talking to a lot of those boys,

19:30.299 --> 19:47.785
that it was very much the same attitude to the kids 
when they were going through the school. It was

19:47.945 --> 19:49.047
very much the same. But the product that they 
produced,

19:49.381 --> 19:54.986
it was about the same. But there's no doubt in my 
mind that the officer that came out of Texas A&M

19:55.026 --> 20:05.035
was a very fine officer in the services. I don't 
think I've ever come across an Aggie officer in the

20:05.756 --> 20:14.724
military that I found I had trouble with. I can 
truthfully say that. I can't say that. about West

20:18.001 --> 20:21.825
Horners and getting Navy to change officers. I 
have come across a few of them. And of course,

20:23.846 --> 20:27.450
probably over the long haul, I've met more of them. 
But of course, I can't ever think of an Aggie that

20:27.770 --> 20:31.854
I've come across. Did you favor Aggies? Were you 
biased toward Aggies after you went to A&M? I mean,

20:35.577 --> 20:38.460
did you try to promote them faster because they 
were Aggies? No, sirree. Any way that you acted any

20:39.881 --> 20:43.825
different to Aggies? No. I very carefully watched 
myself on OERs when I was grading an Aggie. If

20:56.026 --> 20:57.687
anything, I probably know the other way. I didn't. 
I never wanted to be biased toward an Aggie on his

20:58.088 --> 21:02.912
OER with respect to his career. I'm not that type of 
an officer.

21:10.439 --> 21:14.603
Now, I've often heard that A&M is more than just an 
institution of higher learning, but it's

21:15.106 --> 21:18.390
something special. Would you agree with that?

21:24.759 --> 21:39.639
I guess I have to answer that yes, and then go back 
and say that that's the reason I think always, even

21:24.759 --> 21:39.639
when I was a young fella and first learned even what 
a college or university was, I've always wanted to

21:24.759 --> 21:39.639
go to A&M. And I guess it's just that there was 
something about spirit There was an Aggie or an A&M

21:45.008 --> 22:01.542
spirit that I learned, first heard about and 
learned more and more about and became exposed to

21:45.008 --> 22:01.542
it with Aggie officers, you know, even before I 
went to Texas A&M in a service and talking to them.

22:01.743 --> 22:10.670
And I just thought there was something special 
about spirit that they had. And I swear, I just

22:11.851 --> 22:14.914
don't think It's hard to put your finger on it, but I 
don't think they have this open spirit at the

22:15.502 --> 22:22.851
academies. I can't define it. I think it may be that 
I'm trying to say it's

22:25.495 --> 22:45.120
a more enforced, therefore I must do it type of a 
spirit at the academies, whereas at A&M it's just

22:25.495 --> 22:45.120
sort of a self-instilled,

22:47.648 --> 22:49.410
Traditional, if you will. Tradition going out of 
what I don't know, but to me it's traditional. It's

22:53.955 --> 22:56.518
just a spirit. And you hear all over the United 
States today the Aggie spirit. I don't know. It's

23:05.449 --> 23:07.571
just great, and I think it still exists. What were 
your feelings when you left A&M?

23:12.657 --> 23:14.339
Well, I tell you, I was tired. I bet you were tired. 
And I was... I had been out of my military

23:17.872 --> 23:23.937
environment, my professional military 
environment, for over two years. So really, I was

23:24.438 --> 23:30.543
glad to be leaving A&M and go back to an assignment. 
But I had nothing more but gratitude and thanks for

23:31.144 --> 23:47.338
everybody at the institution because

23:31.144 --> 23:47.338
I had gotten my degree, achieved my objective, I 
was proud. Also, I was particularly happy for my

23:49.086 --> 23:59.696
wife and family because I get to see them more and be 
part of the family again because I've been

23:49.086 --> 23:59.696
studying hard. Oh, yeah. Well, you were in, it 
looks like, a temporary assignment from July 1949

24:01.457 --> 24:11.666
to October 1949 at Mitchell Air Force Base in New 
York. Was that a temporary assignment? Well, no,

24:14.829 --> 24:16.330
it was a... It was an assignment oriented to air 
defense. At that time, the Air Force was trying to

24:23.314 --> 24:35.688
set up a separate command structure within the Air 
Force itself for the specific function of the air

24:23.314 --> 24:35.688
defense role of the United States. And they set up 
an organization called Continental Air Defense

24:36.549 --> 24:43.937
Command at Mitchell Air Force Base. You remember 
me telling you about Bruce Holloway, who was a

24:44.795 --> 24:49.623
major over in China. He asked for me and I wanted to 
go and he had followed my career at A&M and knew what

24:50.324 --> 24:58.898
I'd done. So I ended up going up there and I worked 
for him in planning. Okay. And at that time I

25:03.666 --> 25:04.828
started It was rather a... Until 1951 then. Right. 
And then it was time to go to an air work college.

25:13.806 --> 25:15.328
Okay, but I want to know about this. There's a 
couple of questions I want to know about the

25:15.628 --> 25:21.533
Continental Air Defense Command. With this, of 
course, we were working directly with the

25:22.754 --> 25:27.179
Canadians, right? Yes, at that time we started the 
planning and... with ultimately NORAD, North

25:33.091 --> 25:36.796
American Air Defense Command, in mind. And that's 
where the seeds of organization were born right

25:36.816 --> 25:40.301
there. As a matter of fact, working for General 
Holloway and General Thatcher and Colonel George

25:40.321 --> 25:51.638
Brown, who incidentally eventually became the 
chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff. A very, very

25:51.938 --> 25:54.041
fine person. Brilliant man. He was assistant D.O. 
under General Thatcher. Bruce Holloway had

25:59.570 --> 26:03.696
plans, and I was his assistant in plans. So we drew 
up the basic plans for coordination and planning

26:03.716 --> 26:15.552
with the Royal Canadian Air Force for eventual 
organization that turned out to be eventually the

26:03.716 --> 26:15.552
North American Air Defense Command. What were the 
plans? It was just integrate the two and have one

26:16.854 --> 26:25.947
Air Defense Command for the entire North American 
In case of an attack. Continent. Including, we

26:29.738 --> 26:33.762
even had ultimate plans of turning to Mexico, but 
we dropped that. Why? Well, the primary emphasis

26:35.403 --> 26:37.445
was from the north. Bombers coming over the North 
Pole, straight across from Russia to us. And it was

26:41.289 --> 26:51.419
less of a threat, where a bomber might come around 
from the south, across Mexico. And where would be,

26:51.439 --> 26:55.663
in case of an attack, thinking back to 1949, Where 
would be the headquarters? At that time- Where

26:58.801 --> 27:01.365
would you direct the defense from? We began to do 
plans right then for the headquarters in

27:02.847 --> 27:13.621
Colorado, in the mountainous area, with the 
ultimate plan for something in the mountain, in

27:02.847 --> 27:13.621
the hole. The current NORAD control center in 
Colorado Springs, up in the mountains. I was born

27:21.881 --> 27:27.870
in the planning hours right there at Mitchell Air 
Force Base. And what did the Canadians think of

27:27.890 --> 27:34.099
having the command center in Colorado and not in 
Canada? They understood it and went along with it.

27:36.763 --> 27:41.109
Actually, they couldn't afford it anyhow. One of 
the basic decisions I remember, General

27:41.129 --> 27:49.461
Holloway, at that time Colonel Holloway, he and I 
were sitting in a little office about eight by

27:50.133 --> 27:55.740
eight feet, and trying to figure out, well, how are 
we going to get the Canadians to participate in

27:50.133 --> 27:55.740
this? They can't afford it. And I said, why don't we 
think in terms of, we'll pay two-thirds, you pay

27:57.542 --> 28:01.326
one-third. That stuck from then on, and that was 
the basis for the original planning of all the pine

28:03.008 --> 28:17.085
tree air defenses, which were the first radar I put 
along the southern Canadian border adjacent to

28:03.008 --> 28:17.085
the United States and up the Labrador coast. And 
then the due line, which eventually was put across

28:17.487 --> 28:25.842
northern Canada, they paid for one-third and they 
paid for two-thirds. And that was basically your

28:25.862 --> 28:27.385
idea? Really? Because I've read that in 
documents, the one-third, two-thirds. You have?

28:34.077 --> 28:35.620
Yeah. I read that in histories and I didn't know 
that was your basic idea. I thought that they would

28:41.602 --> 28:44.566
have proposed that, because they didn't. Oh, 
should have left it to them. They would say, well,

28:46.028 --> 28:47.910
you pay for the whole thing. We'll just 
participate.

28:51.274 --> 29:04.430
And matter of fact, looking back now, comparing 
what they had and what we had, where we saw and so

28:51.274 --> 29:04.430
forth, I think it was commendable that they agreed 
to pay for one third of it. Sure. But they had a lot of

29:04.571 --> 29:08.115
other stipulations that was to their favor much 
more than just dollar bills. For instance, to

29:13.420 --> 29:23.049
build radar sites, we had to use Canadian labor and 
Canadian organizations, so that gave them

29:13.420 --> 29:23.049
stimulated economy and industry.

29:25.632 --> 29:27.814
They permitted us to man certain stations. They 
didn't have the manpower to do it. Some production

29:31.097 --> 29:35.942
of radars and the gear, that kind of gear, went to 
radar sites. had to be produced in Canada. So

29:39.528 --> 29:49.121
really saying it, you know, we'd pay one-third, 
we'd pay two-thirds, really they got a lot more out

29:39.528 --> 29:49.121
of it than we did, but it was worth it. And that basic 
type planning grew eventually what turned out to

29:49.461 --> 29:55.088
be NORAD. And, of course, the deputy commander was 
a marshal, a four-star general from the Royal

29:55.168 --> 30:05.642
Canadian Air Force. Are the British included in 
this? No, no. It's RCAM, Royal Canadian Air Force.

30:16.548 --> 30:22.775
Tell me about the relations between the Canadian 
officers and the American officers. Were there

30:23.216 --> 30:28.522
any times that there was tension? Never. As a 
matter of fact, working with the Royal Canadian

30:29.203 --> 30:34.810
Air Force types was just like working with 
America. No problem, as a matter of fact. I can't

30:37.381 --> 30:52.503
think of any problem, ever any problem, either at 
the planning stage and in Ottawa and Washington

30:37.381 --> 30:52.503
D.C. at the high level stages where we even sat down 
in some cases with, you know, political

30:37.381 --> 30:52.503
civilians, high level civilians, State 
Department types. Never any. It was, for

30:56.869 --> 31:03.439
instance, compared to the problem I had in Russia 
dealing with people, no problem whatsoever. And

31:04.347 --> 31:10.793
subsequent dealings with the Italians and NATO, 
never. It's just like planning with Americans. No

31:15.457 --> 31:17.479
problem whatsoever. And subsequently in the 
field when I had command of radar divisions and

31:17.499 --> 31:24.666
fighter squadrons, the corporation was 
splendid. They're terrific bunch. What about the

31:27.028 --> 31:30.131
quality of the Air Force officers? Canada? Great. 
Terrific. On our quality? Oh, yeah. Terrific.

31:38.873 --> 31:39.734
See, they were smaller. Sure. And I don't know if 
that makes for them being as good or better, but

31:41.075 --> 31:52.268
they had the cream of the crop of Canada, young men. 
And a lot of the equipment they used was our

31:52.508 --> 31:58.274
equipment and vice versa. We had standardization 
parts. We're the British, too, though. Oh, yeah.

32:03.173 --> 32:06.878
Oh, getting off on the British, don't get me wrong, 
the RAF are absolutely fantastic. No, I meant we

32:07.979 --> 32:11.164
had standardization of the parts with the British 
also. Oh, yeah, yeah, but a while ago you asked me if

32:11.244 --> 32:15.429
the RAF was involved. Yeah, I was wondering if the 
RAF was involved in any way because, see, there's

32:15.449 --> 32:20.837
still a Dominion. Okay, no. And how about the 
planning? What was your role as far as the planning

32:25.663 --> 32:29.829
of the dew line in the earlier warning systems? The 
same thing. Same thing, the birth of all of that

32:31.051 --> 32:40.262
North American planning was done right there by 
our outfit.

32:40.342 --> 32:57.682
And the basic, and even what turned out to be the 
SAGE system, semi-automatic ground environment

32:40.342 --> 32:57.682
system, the computerized control of air defense. 
We started the basic concept of that. Now, what was

33:01.510 --> 33:03.653
the basic concept of that? Air defense controlled 
by computer. Oh, the SAGE. SAGE, S-A-G-E,

33:07.218 --> 33:30.150
standing for Semi-Automatic Ground Environment 
System, where a controller at a normal radar site

33:07.218 --> 33:30.150
looking at the scope and seeing the blips of an 
incoming bomber would speak over a ground-to-air

33:07.218 --> 33:30.150
communication radio telephone, RT, and direct a 
pilot across the scope, seeing him pit-blip also

33:30.451 --> 33:37.339
where he'd make the intercept. Semi-automatic 
ground environment was of a nature where

33:39.781 --> 33:54.638
eventually we didn't even plan to have data link 
and actually tied into the flight control system

33:39.781 --> 33:54.638
of the airplane where a man wasn't even in the link. 
Everything was done automatically by computer

33:54.718 --> 33:59.243
until the two blips came together on a scope. It's 
automatically telling the fire control system

33:59.678 --> 34:04.686
and the all-weather fighter when to fire the 
missile. That was the ultimate. In some cases, we

34:06.509 --> 34:08.152
achieved that. In other cases... By what year? 
NORAD was the last...

34:22.555 --> 34:23.256
The... When I took over the 25th Air Division in 
Tacoma, Washington at McCord Air Force Base in

34:23.540 --> 34:41.202
1957, I believe, I took over command of what we call 
the grease pencil manual stage. And it was just

34:43.545 --> 34:52.737
ready to convert into and move into this huge 50 by 
50 by 50-foot-high concrete

34:52.953 --> 35:11.637
sage direction center, which occupied, which I 
mean, which encompassed primarily the huge

34:52.953 --> 35:11.637
computer, which incidentally was operated with 
electron tubes and vacuum tubes. And it took that

35:11.657 --> 35:16.724
big a building, completely air conditioned, just 
to maintain that computer. And as a side remark,

35:17.705 --> 35:21.610
can you imagine that big a space for a computer, 
which now, today, in 1981, a computer does have

35:21.893 --> 35:29.082
about the size of this desk for each floor.

35:32.266 --> 35:47.104
But in those days, as part of the system, I know I'm 
rambling here, but there was not enough computer

35:32.266 --> 35:47.104
programmers in the United States to do this job. We 
had to hold up the program for converting to a

35:50.024 --> 35:54.330
semi-automatic ground environment system for 
the United States and Canada. We had to hold up the

35:54.350 --> 36:11.132
system for several months to actually give SDC, I 
forget even what that stands for out in Santa

35:54.350 --> 36:11.132
Monica, California, a contract for recruiting 
and training computer programmers to do this job.

36:12.714 --> 36:18.462
It was that, and of course it was programmed to cost 
billions of dollars, and this is what scared a lot

36:19.083 --> 36:21.526
of people, including people in the Air Force. This 
cost would cut into, let's say, more higher

36:21.546 --> 36:32.420
priority programs like building up the Strategic 
Air Command Bomber Force. And what about SAGE?

36:34.303 --> 36:37.186
When was it activated? The first ground, the first 
direction center I believe it was the 26th Area

36:42.067 --> 36:51.098
Division just north of New York City, north of 
Mitchell Field, you know, where we did the initial

36:42.067 --> 36:51.098
planning. I forget the name of it, but that was 
where the first Direction Center went in, and

36:51.138 --> 37:12.023
I don't remember, Terry, it had to be, when

36:51.138 --> 37:12.023
I came back to

36:51.138 --> 37:12.023
ADC and Con Ed in Northern Pittsburgh, it had to be 
Around 52 or 53.

37:17.946 --> 37:19.408
Some were in the early 50s. Because when I went to 
25th Air Division in 57, I believe, 56, 57 up at

37:19.989 --> 37:37.831
Tacoma, Washington, as 25th Air Division 
commander, they were just completing at Sayles

37:19.989 --> 37:37.831
Direction Center, and I moved into it before I left 
there within one year. And it was probably the

37:38.692 --> 37:40.795
second or third one. Now, ultimately, they were 
going to have the initial plan called for 20 of

37:41.298 --> 37:48.927
these, all of the United States. So you can see 
where the cost went up. Sure. And eventually, we

37:51.090 --> 37:58.458
included, I believe, three in Canada. That 
system, by the way, is still operating. It's still

38:01.362 --> 38:03.725
operating. But not in its entirety. They have cut 
out a lot of them. Sure, better radar. Well, plus

38:09.310 --> 38:14.316
the fact that the threat of a bomber threat is just 
not what it used to be. This is not, the SAGE will not

38:14.877 --> 38:18.542
take care of the missile threat. No. Total 
integration of the two air forces, Canadian and

38:19.283 --> 38:24.129
American.

38:27.574 --> 38:34.963
Like I say, we included two direction centers 
across the border, one just north of Idaho and one

38:27.574 --> 38:34.963
out towards Vancouver, and those are the main 
ones.

38:39.905 --> 38:40.726
of the United States. For instance, the Detroit 
area lapped way over into, at least covered the

38:41.447 --> 38:48.634
populated area of southern Canada. The air 
defenses of Canada and the United States were

38:49.135 --> 38:56.203
completely integrated, very smoothly done. 
Still are? Still are, including the dew line. As

39:02.329 --> 39:05.693
you know, the dew line was practically manned by 
civilians. And I was wondering if the dew line is

39:06.820 --> 39:10.185
still functional today. Are we still using that? I 
can't answer that question. I doubt it. But I do

39:17.718 --> 39:24.509
know that the huge radars at Thule in Alaska 
oriented toward the missile threat. And I did a

39:25.811 --> 39:32.602
subsequent assignment to put in the air defenses 
at Thule Greenland. Radar . But that's later on

39:34.917 --> 39:39.562
in my career. This sounds like a very important 
assignment. It was at that time. Looking back now,

39:43.947 --> 39:45.769
I didn't realize it. But it was the basis for very 
close coordination and cooperation with another

39:47.952 --> 39:53.298
nation. And again, I learned a lot. This is 
tantamount to what you call combined planning

39:56.461 --> 40:02.308
between nations. Combined Chiefs of Staff? 
Right. Did you do any work for the Combined Chiefs?

40:08.463 --> 40:08.864
Oh, yeah. Well, Canada, RCIA. And a lot of times the 
Canadian Army was involved, just like the United

40:11.748 --> 40:18.357
States Army with their Nike missiles. Sure. Did 
you think it was a good idea, depending so much on a

40:20.760 --> 40:28.791
foreign nation, for our air defense system? No. It 
was so logical And we thought of Canada so much as

40:32.225 --> 40:39.995
our buddies and friends, you know, that this never 
entered our mind. The fact that they were a

40:40.035 --> 40:43.800
different nation never really entered our mind. 
Not Canada, no, sir. They felt the same way. Well, I

40:48.286 --> 40:57.017
wonder what your feelings were during the Vietnam 
War when Canada, for a few years, was harboring

40:48.286 --> 40:57.017
American... dissidents and deserters of the 
American military? Did your ideas toward Canada

41:00.950 --> 41:02.692
change? No, sir. As a matter of fact, I didn't blame 
this on Canada. It was the individuals themselves

41:08.180 --> 41:18.954
taking advantage of what were legal rights of 
people going to other nations and all, and I didn't

41:08.180 --> 41:18.954
blame Canada for this. Okay. Now, let's leave and 
talk about the Air Work Comp. What was the Air War

41:27.710 --> 41:30.913
College Institute?

41:32.635 --> 41:36.579
This was back right after the war was over. They 
began to establish and think in terms of training

41:36.600 --> 41:49.874
and education then, and orienting themselves to 
terrific demobilization and just getting rid of

41:36.600 --> 41:49.874
all the experience they have. And they could 
foresee bringing in new people and training and

41:49.914 --> 41:54.298
educating them. And they saw the benefits and 
advantages educated people, in particular in the

41:56.971 --> 42:07.926
latest tactics and strategy that we had learned, 
you know, in this tremendous worldwide war, World

41:56.971 --> 42:07.926
War II. And they wanted to be able to teach this to 
the new incoming young people. And so it was

42:16.577 --> 42:24.868
shortly after the war, in the early, mid and late 
40s, that they began to plan for this. It was also a

42:25.169 --> 42:54.889
feather in the cap of a young, ambitious officer to 
be chosen to go to these schools, because if you

42:25.169 --> 42:54.889
were chosen to go to the school and you had this on 
your record, then you felt that you were in towards

42:25.169 --> 42:54.889
promotion and being, you know, like you go from 
squadron officer school to the staff course, then

42:25.169 --> 42:54.889
to the, eventually to the Air War College, and then 
even eventually, well, that to the National War

42:25.169 --> 42:54.889
College, which was a joint school in Washington, 
D.C. So I was delighted, and as a matter of fact, I

42:56.388 --> 43:01.256
wanted to go. I remember doing some soul 
searching, and I think all of us did that. Is this

43:07.064 --> 43:20.225
really the best route to take to spend a year in a 
school and miss some command opportunities for,

43:07.064 --> 43:20.225
let's say, some newly formed jet organizations, 
fighter organizations? You ask yourself that

43:20.706 --> 43:22.969
question a lot of times, I finally decided, and 
talked to a lot of my senior officers, the

43:23.506 --> 43:33.016
commander, that it was best to go to the Air Force. 
So I went, gladly. And what about your curriculum?

43:38.081 --> 43:52.416
It was a combination of

43:38.081 --> 43:52.416
what it was, really it covered the waterfront, 
politics to economics to psychological, to

43:53.375 --> 44:22.757
actual military problems and principles, the 
principles of war, how the growing, and

43:53.375 --> 44:22.757
particularly taken from the lesson of World War 
II, how nations depend on one another, combined

43:53.375 --> 44:22.757
planning, joint planning, alliances, and then 
right on down to tactics and technique of

43:53.375 --> 44:22.757
operating the advanced equipment the problems of 
training. It covered the waterfront, just about.

44:27.089 --> 44:34.219
Well, it provided a field grade type officer, 
meaning major, lieutenant, colonel, colonel. It

44:34.239 --> 44:44.294
provided him with a good understanding of command 
type problems he'd be confronted with in his later

44:34.239 --> 44:44.294
years, let's say as a general officer. It was 
really worthwhile, a terrific idea, and I think

44:44.614 --> 44:50.142
there's still great school. And incidentally, 
State Department people go to those schools now.

44:55.707 --> 44:59.571
And also, some foreigners are permitted to 
attend. Did you have any British in your classes?

45:01.853 --> 45:02.193
You did? Because at this time, we were exchanging 
officers with Britain and Canada. We had some RAF

45:06.798 --> 45:08.600
officers. We had an Army. Some Army. You know, my 
Air Force officers went to the Army War College,

45:11.123 --> 45:15.848
too. I didn't want to go to Army War College. The 
idea was to go there. the War College of Yonar. The

45:22.906 --> 45:26.270
Navy had the same type of school. But we always felt 
best, among my colleagues, to go to Air War

45:26.290 --> 45:33.499
College.

45:34.199 --> 45:40.848
But to go back, we had Army and Navy officers, 
ground and pilot types. In our class, we had RAF, we

45:41.588 --> 45:46.114
had Canadians. We had, if I remember correctly, I 
think I think we had a Chinese officer.

45:59.298 --> 46:03.201
Later on, I think it was later on, we had Iranian 
officers. I don't recall the one, but we had some

46:03.221 --> 46:08.126
other foreign, Italian, we had a couple of Italian 
officers. What was the quality of the average

46:08.146 --> 46:12.430
student, your colleagues? Well, above average, 
and this of course was criteria in the way they were

46:13.011 --> 46:17.174
picked. If you will, the cream of the crop. through 
the school system. What about the professors? Or

46:26.909 --> 46:27.891
the instructors? The professors, some were 
military professionals, of course commanded by

46:27.911 --> 46:43.453
Major General Air Force, but we did have civilian 
professors in some areas like maybe in economics

46:27.911 --> 46:43.453
or politics. I think one of our professors was a 
State Department man, State Department trained

46:44.474 --> 46:51.865
career officer, assigned to the college. We had

46:52.503 --> 47:03.137
a few military instructors, you know,
