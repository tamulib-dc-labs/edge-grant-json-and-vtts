WEBVTT

00:02.039 --> 00:03.701
Philadelphia and Washington DC. Why was that so 
parallel? Well that was lousy weather that winter

00:04.842 --> 00:16.154
and the Air Corps airplanes weren't equipped with 
good instruments for instruments for instrument

00:04.842 --> 00:16.154
flying. It had no radio aids to tell them when they 
were on the course and they no de-ices on the

00:16.174 --> 00:30.510
airplanes and these poor They were told to take 
this mail from here to there and busted right

00:31.857 --> 00:44.897
through night and day and nothing, regardless of 
weather weather. That's no way to stay alive. I got

00:47.060 --> 00:48.642
out there to Pittsburgh. The first 60 hours I was 
out there, I was on duty for 52 hours. I got eight

00:56.915 --> 00:59.198
hours sleep out of 60. There was another fella out 
there named Shulgin, and if the weather was

01:00.443 --> 01:15.280
doubtful, I'd tell the pilot, go into the hotel in 
Keysport and get some sleep. I'd put this damn mail

01:15.601 --> 01:17.483
on the train. So I'd have a little post office out 
there at the airport. I'd tell the postmaster,

01:22.990 --> 01:27.615
send it into town, put it on the train. put the 
airplane in the hangar, wait for some good

01:28.675 --> 01:34.742
weather. The next day, if the weather was decent, I 
had the pilot to take the plane on back to where I got

01:34.762 --> 01:41.029
it. I stopped all killing out there. I didn't 
expedite the air mail particularly, but I kept

01:43.912 --> 01:52.282
losing good piloting equipment. Sure. Hell with 
the business of getting it through.

02:00.080 --> 02:07.509
You thought that this idea of getting it through at 
any cost was foolish? I thought that

02:07.529 --> 02:18.503
the youngster named Shulgin was out there, and he 
was, I guess, afraid to do anything. Jones, B.Q.

02:20.126 --> 02:29.918
Jones, knew I would

02:20.126 --> 02:29.918
dare to do anything that was necessary, to hell 
with the higher-ups, including Roosevelt. And so

02:31.079 --> 02:36.571
he sent me out there and I stopped the killing.

02:39.297 --> 02:41.703
What did the postman think about this? Were they 
upset because it took longer now? No. Post Office

02:46.974 --> 02:50.522
Authority, they didn't worry about it.

03:01.437 --> 03:04.702
There's one, I'll show you how bad it was. It was a 
little fighter plane, P-12. Got no, just barely

03:08.787 --> 03:11.511
room for the pilot. There's a little place back at 
the pilot where he can put his bags, clothing bags.

03:20.083 --> 03:29.757
We come and land in there with mail sacks stacked 
around the engine, stacked around the cockpit,

03:20.083 --> 03:29.757
stuff full back here. and so damn cold that it got 
down to 22 below zero that winter. It was so cold

03:39.168 --> 03:47.817
that before we could get that airplane, the mail 
sacks off, the engine was so cold that we couldn't

03:39.168 --> 03:47.817
get it started again. So, the pilot goes into the 
hotel to run the airplane down into the United

03:57.935 --> 04:02.342
hangar, I believe, had a hangar there. United 
Airlines are very nice to us there, very

04:03.444 --> 04:10.635
cooperative. Put the airplane down there and get 
it heated up to where we can get it started again the

04:11.376 --> 04:16.384
next morning. That's the kind of equipment we had 
to carry mail. The only instruments in a P-12,

04:24.243 --> 04:38.902
that's a pursuit airplane, they call them fighter 
planes nowadays, was the necessary instruments

04:24.243 --> 04:38.902
to fly in good weather.

04:41.686 --> 04:48.295
You know, they had a banking turn, you could fly in 
bad weather, but no de-ices on it at all. Playing

04:50.137 --> 04:52.140
ice, getting iced up, down here to

04:53.369 --> 04:59.440
go. It was a fiasco. It did help us get some good 
equipment later though. Because the government

05:05.470 --> 05:13.664
realized that you were not as well prepared as you 
should have been? Yeah. When people, young

05:17.973 --> 05:33.429
actually get started getting killed you know and 
losing aircraft and newspapers pick it up and they

05:17.973 --> 05:33.429
want to know why of course naturally and then the 
senators and the representatives start noticing

05:17.973 --> 05:33.429
things and then you get some action. Sure. Up till 
then we could yell our heads off and they'd pay no

05:35.871 --> 05:40.336
attention to us. Right.

05:44.260 --> 05:45.141
How long were you there? I was there until May, 
sometime in May. I finally got back to Boston. May

05:53.867 --> 05:54.768
of 37? No, May of 34 this was. We started flying the 
mail January of 34 and we flew it to May of 34 and then

06:02.076 --> 06:11.087
turned it back to the airlines. And I got back to 
Boston airport. I'd been gone seven months on

06:15.351 --> 06:18.675
temporary duty. And when I got back to Boston 
Airport, I asked Washington to transfer me out of

06:20.275 --> 06:35.330
that National Guard squadron over to the reserve 
detachment that was there on the same airport,

06:20.275 --> 06:35.330
where I could at least have something to do. And so I 
got over with the reserve, but I still didn't like

06:37.112 --> 06:43.278
living in Boston. Why not? Oh, I don't like the 
weather. I didn't care for the people,

06:46.762 --> 06:49.945
particularly. Not my kind

06:51.022 --> 06:56.127
of people. What do you mean by that? I don't know.

07:08.758 --> 07:19.307
I just don't seem to think the way I do, and I can't 
explain that either, because you don't know

07:08.758 --> 07:19.307
whether you like somebody or you don't like them. 
Here in Del Rio, for instance, we made more friends

07:20.587 --> 07:26.994
than we would make in Boston if I lived there 50 
years.

07:31.980 --> 07:34.963
I wouldn't try to explain it. Did they assign you to 
the National Guard or anything? I went to the

07:39.388 --> 07:49.480
reserves and then I put in to go to Panama in January 
of 1935.

07:50.978 --> 07:55.944
my friend in the Chief of Air Force office.

07:58.627 --> 08:02.652
Personnel got me signed to Panama. Went down there 
in February of 1935. And by this time you were a

08:04.194 --> 08:08.699
captain. I was a captain at that time and then they 
started temporary promotions. We finally got

08:15.668 --> 08:19.973
away from the single list and they started The Air 
Force, Air Corps, got permission from the powers

08:20.257 --> 08:30.107
that be to make temporary promotions. Well, why is 
that? Why do you think? Well, here I was, I was 19,

08:32.289 --> 08:39.357
35, 18. That's 17 years. 16

08:42.780 --> 08:48.306
years as a lieutenant and a year as a captain. and I 
was doing major work. I was assigned the

08:53.230 --> 08:59.956
commanding officer of the pursuit squadron in 
Panama the minute I got there. That was a major's

08:59.976 --> 09:05.662
job, so why not make me a major?

09:09.545 --> 09:13.369
Why should we all always be submerged like that?

09:16.491 --> 09:18.293
So it started as temporary. promotion. Funny 
thing, in May I was a lieutenant and I went to

09:20.097 --> 09:25.984
captain as 34. And February

09:26.224 --> 09:40.881
35, ten months, nine months later, I'm a major, a 
temporary major. And for some reason they

09:40.901 --> 09:47.689
canceled out the temporary business and put me 
back to captain for about a week, and then I went

09:48.395 --> 09:54.062
back to a major. They couldn't make up their mind. I 
had something wrong. Then I went to lieutenant

09:57.166 --> 10:04.195
colonel in 37, so there's a... So you went to three 
grades in three years. I can show you even worse. I

10:08.120 --> 10:16.090
was 16 years a lieutenant, one year a captain in 
1935. In 1943, I was the burglary general, so

10:17.150 --> 10:26.182
that's how fast I went up after they got off this 
single list.

10:29.386 --> 10:38.118
Did that, getting off the single list and going to 
the new system of temporary appointments, did

10:29.386 --> 10:38.118
that lift morale? Yeah, it helped.

10:48.031 --> 10:55.739
In 1937, I went to the Command General Staff 
School, which is an Army school in Fort

10:48.031 --> 10:55.739
Leavenworth. But tell me a little bit about 
Panama. What did you think about being down in

10:57.401 --> 11:00.104
Panama in the 1930s? Oh, I loved it. The weather was 
fine. We worked from 7 until noon, and then I had to

11:03.167 --> 11:11.676
play polo and got off. I got to lead several 
flights. I led a flight down, headed for Peru one

11:15.434 --> 11:26.672
time with a flight of Pursuits, BW-12, Pursuit 
planes there. I got down in Columbia, ran into foul

11:26.692 --> 11:36.567
weather and I was afraid of losing.

11:36.587 --> 11:40.954
That's just why it would be refreshing, I think.

11:43.600 --> 11:44.642
Go ahead, son, honey.

11:50.470 --> 11:53.635
I'm going to rush you all out to go to lunch about 
11.30. 11.30? I'm about to lose my voice.

12:02.969 --> 12:03.870
You know, this is wine. I don't know if you're on a 
wagon or not. No, no, no, this is fine. I got out in

12:11.107 --> 12:13.270
Cali, Columbia. I figured on landing farther down 
in Columbia on a beach called Tumaco Beach to gas up

12:13.590 --> 12:40.624
for the last leg in Guayaquil, Ecuador and the 
Colombian government decided it was too

12:13.590 --> 12:40.624
dangerous to allow us to land on Tumaco Beach and 
So, I took the flight down another 100 kilometers

12:41.836 --> 13:07.624
to a place called Los Rios and filled up every tank, 
you know, right to the top and started for the

12:41.836 --> 13:07.624
Guayaquil and got out over the ocean and ran into a 
wall of water and, you know, P-12, the same one that

13:08.043 --> 13:11.968
tell me about flying air mail in. Not equipped to 
fight that kind of weather. We could fly and we

13:16.074 --> 13:34.838
could fly on instruments, but here's the Andes 
Mountains going up to 30,000 feet over here on land

13:16.074 --> 13:34.838
and here's the Pacific Ocean with it raining like 
hell.

13:35.720 --> 13:36.801
I'm gonna lose some airplanes and pilots here, but 
I don't go back, so I just turned around and went

13:36.967 --> 13:47.042
back into Cali, Columbia, and we spent the night 
there. And you didn't lose anybody? I didn't lose

13:49.165 --> 14:02.446
anybody, but I didn't get to Peru, not with that 
kind of equipment, and I let a flight up to

13:49.165 --> 14:02.446
Nicaragua one time. It was a civilian pilot. named 
Kingsley, who was flying from Managua to the mines

14:05.468 --> 14:17.139
that were on the northern part of the country. He 
had a Ford tri-motor.

14:25.568 --> 14:31.393
And he went down somewhere in the vast forest 
between Managua and the mines. And General

14:32.614 --> 14:35.357
Somoza, who was president, about Nicaragua. I 
asked Panama to send a flight up there to help find

14:41.003 --> 14:44.928
him. So I took about eight, I was put in charge of the 
flight, about eight or nine airplanes. We went up

14:53.780 --> 15:00.028
to Managua and searched that area but You couldn't 
see, like looking for a needle in a haystack. Sure.

15:05.120 --> 15:05.861
I remember one time. It was jungle too, wasn't it? 
Yeah, just a big jungle. You can't see down, you

15:08.924 --> 15:10.886
can't see anything. I remember in Panama, I saw a 
pilot jump out of an airplane right next to the

15:11.647 --> 15:20.155
canal. I saw exactly where the plane went in. I flew 
immediately over there. to look to see what the

15:26.992 --> 15:30.057
plane was and I couldn't never find it. I knew 
exactly where it was and I couldn't see it. It's

15:35.004 --> 15:37.088
like, what... It's a lot of possible. While we were 
there, this fellow, Kingsley's brother is

15:39.271 --> 15:46.142
searching and he gets lost. He goes down, so 
there's two Kingsley brothers, both Americans,

15:46.662 --> 15:53.413
lost in that jungle. I never did find them. Samosa 
had us all up at the palace and thanked us and the

15:55.612 --> 16:01.699
cocktail party. Did they die? Oh, they were gone, 
yeah. They never did mine. So you lost one out of

16:08.286 --> 16:09.828
your crew? No, no. No, Kingsley, Kingsley's 
brother went down. No, I didn't lose any of mine.

16:15.554 --> 16:17.997
All good. I got them all back to Panama. And what'd 
you think of Samosa? Oh, I liked him. He was a West

16:23.843 --> 16:28.168
Point graduate.

16:28.829 --> 16:38.181
I met his son,

16:28.829 --> 16:38.181
who was the one that was run out recently and was 
murdered down in Paraguay.

16:40.684 --> 16:43.928
I liked him, the family. How'd they treat you, 
American Flyers? They just treated us fine. They

16:51.181 --> 17:05.099
were, well Samosa was very much concerned that 
these two American Kingsley brothers were lost,

16:51.181 --> 17:05.099
but he did the best he could. He had eight of us up 
there, eight airplanes from Panama looking for

17:05.139 --> 17:13.110
him. It was an impossible job.

17:20.915 --> 17:28.004
We used to

17:20.915 --> 17:28.004
fly up and down Central America. Goodwill 
flights. Oh, really? During the mid-thirties?

17:32.590 --> 17:33.852
Yeah, 35 or 37. During Roosevelt's good neighbor 
policy.

17:40.160 --> 17:40.261
Yeah. For us, it was just good training and having a 
good time when we got there. Did the government Did

17:48.809 --> 17:56.156
the government of the United States give you any 
instructions? Or did they just say be friendly?

17:57.338 --> 18:05.506
Well, the first thing I'd do is call on the local 
ambassador, the American ambassador. He'd

18:05.526 --> 18:10.451
probably be out there to meet us at the airport, you 
know. And then we'd go to a cocktail party that

18:10.471 --> 18:14.715
night and dinner. property, embassy, put it on 
board or something. Maybe the local chamber of

18:20.620 --> 18:25.867
commerce

18:20.620 --> 18:25.867
or somebody. We had a good time. Did your Spanish 
improve? Did I what? Spanish improve? Did your

18:31.695 --> 18:35.339
Spanish improve? Oh, yeah. I got to where I did 
after a couple of drinks. I'm losing my tongue. I

18:42.529 --> 18:44.331
bust right into Spanish. Do you think that the 
attempt to increase friendly relations between

18:46.454 --> 18:54.146
the United States and Central America, was it 
successful? Well, I think we did some good. Maybe

18:59.153 --> 19:08.327
not as much as we thought we were, but I think we were 
certainly welcome. You were? Yeah. Was there any,

19:10.250 --> 19:13.835
was there ever any anti-American feeling that you 
felt? Never. Never a bit.

19:18.181 --> 19:22.827
So they were happy to have you, Flyers, as their 
guest? They were happy to have us come into the

19:23.067 --> 19:32.420
country and make a little excitement for them, you 
know. Sure. Did you put on any air shows like the Air

19:32.600 --> 19:35.645
Force did today? No, no, we didn't put on any air 
shows for them. but the feeling at that time was

19:39.830 --> 19:47.477
very friendly to Americans in all of those 
countries. In Managua, for instance, they took us

19:48.939 --> 20:04.053
up one time to where they have a coffee tasting, a 
coffee wholesale outfit that grades coffee. They

20:04.314 --> 20:08.858
have a big round table that revolves and they have a 
coffee expert sitting around this table and each

20:09.800 --> 20:38.878
has a little cup and in each cup is a little sample of 
coffee and so they sit there and pick it off the

20:09.800 --> 20:38.878
table and they slurp it up so it hits the roof of 
their mouth and then quickly spit it out so it

20:09.800 --> 20:38.878
doesn't touch their tongue because if it touches 
their tongue that would spoil the taste for the

20:39.888 --> 20:44.212
next one. So they slurped it up, hit the roof of the 
mountain, and spit it out. The tables moved

20:48.677 --> 20:54.523
around, and other cups in front of them. That's the 
way they grade coffee. Actually, that was

20:57.386 --> 20:58.807
interesting for you. That was very interesting

20:59.268 --> 21:06.015
for me. How often did you go on these flights, these 
goodwill flights? Oh, I think we would manage

21:09.706 --> 21:17.857
about every two months, something like that. And 
usually to a different country? And did you go to

21:21.402 --> 21:23.745
all the countries in Latin America? Yeah. We 
usually went all the way up to Guatemala. We didn't

21:28.331 --> 21:32.457
make Mexico, but we'd go up to Guatemala City. And 
one time I took a flight over to Salvador. El

21:39.187 --> 21:41.931
Salvador. We never did stop in Honduras, because I 
think they were unfriendly to us at that time, but

21:41.951 --> 22:06.645
Costa Rica was very friendly, and there's so many 
Englishmen in Costa Rica, Americans, they speak

21:41.951 --> 22:06.645
English mostly everywhere, and they were very 
friendly to us, and the other direction towards

22:08.110 --> 22:11.714
South America, we never got very far. That flight I 
took to Columbia was the only flight we ever made to

22:13.756 --> 22:18.722
South America. Why didn't you go further to South 
America? I don't know. With

22:23.087 --> 22:30.796
our equipment, we couldn't get to Peru. So that 
left If we were on the other side, we could probably

22:35.110 --> 22:49.031
get to Venezuela by landing at Guadalajara, a port 
just outside of Caracas. We could probably get

22:50.474 --> 22:52.216
that far. We might have gotten to Georgetown or 
British Guiana. most of the niggers there, so not

23:01.756 --> 23:08.404
much point.

23:08.425 --> 23:11.108
And I think they were going communist at the time. 
Columbia, we got to Cali, but Bogota, I don't know

23:13.251 --> 23:25.266
if our planes would have done so well at that 
altitude at about five or six thousand feet. So you

23:26.967 --> 23:28.648
didn't want a chance then? Going north, 
everything was fine. Was your main mission in

23:34.093 --> 23:41.019
Panama to guard the canals on them? Yeah. We were 
part of the American Army down there. We were very

23:45.863 --> 23:56.012
spit and polish, inspection every Saturday.

23:56.515 --> 24:14.933
I was commanding one pursuit squad on the 31st and 
I'd take them up every morning and teach dog

23:56.515 --> 24:14.933
fighting, simulated dog fighting and things like 
that. Did you ever lose any pilots? We lost a few

24:17.836 --> 24:22.320
pilots.

24:23.532 --> 24:42.348
We lost a pilot on cross-country from, night 
cross-country from

24:23.532 --> 24:42.348
the north part of the canal zone back to Albrook, 
from Fransfield to Albrook. And this pilot man

24:42.368 --> 24:53.117
just dove into the ground, dove into the swamp, 
killed he and his mechanic. How'd you get along

24:54.498 --> 24:59.165
with the Panamanian people? They liked their 
money. They liked their money. They had

25:04.173 --> 25:18.615
a lot of saloon and things like that in Panama.

25:20.907 --> 25:39.513
Americans would come down there, and they had a 
union, what they called a union club, and we used to

25:20.907 --> 25:39.513
go quite often to have parties there in the union 
club, and dance half the night, and drink, and

25:20.907 --> 25:39.513
spend lots of money

25:20.907 --> 25:39.513
in there. I'm trying to think

25:39.533 --> 25:48.785
of the name of that. Was there ever any Did you feel 
ever that there was some anti-Americanism? No.

25:57.363 --> 25:58.644
None whatever. I belong to the Panama Golf Club. 
I've done it in Panama. I played with Panamanians

26:03.411 --> 26:11.982
and a lot of Americans belong to it. American 
civilians. An American civilian is pro

26:14.646 --> 26:19.753
and We just got along beautifully, correct? 
Correct. What did you think about the recent

26:25.966 --> 26:38.197
treaty which gave the Panama Canal... That's one 
of the worst things Carter did, I think. I just

26:38.217 --> 26:47.026
don't, I just can't understand

26:38.217 --> 26:47.026
it. That's something Carter put over. He was very 
anxious to do it. And I think one of our Texas

26:50.986 --> 26:54.851
senators voted for it. I think Benson voted for it. 
Like that. I don't understand why we should give it

26:58.756 --> 27:02.761
away. I think it was tragic. Of course, Russia's

27:05.604 --> 27:14.175
trying to cut off our communication. If they can 
get their hands on the Panama Canal, I severed

27:14.932 --> 27:24.545
their communication between west coast and east 
coast for a Navy, except to go clear out Cape Horn.

27:26.067 --> 27:39.946
And they're

27:26.067 --> 27:39.946
trying to close off the Suez Canal by getting into 
Haley

27:26.067 --> 27:39.946
Selassie's country. Ethiopia. Ethiopia. and 
also on the other side in Yemen, South Yemen, Yemen

27:42.522 --> 27:52.457
I guess, where they can flood that off in case of 
war. Makes ships go clear out in case of good hope.

28:02.833 --> 28:07.500
Of course, that cuts the communications for your 
Navy ships. So you think that was a bad move? I think

28:10.784 --> 28:11.785
it was a bad move. I think it was instigated by the 
Communists in Russia. Mr. Tornadio fell right in

28:17.052 --> 28:24.121
for it because he wants to be the dictator there. He 
was a dictator in

28:24.141 --> 28:30.949
fact. I think it was Communist inspired.

28:38.581 --> 28:39.923
When did you leave Panama? I left there in 1937 and 
went to the command general staff school, where

28:41.445 --> 28:52.242
the brass hats go. Sure, what did you think of that? 
Well, when I left Panama they painted one of those

28:54.345 --> 29:03.118
helmets they wear in the tropics, they painted 
brass. So they presented me with that when I got on

29:04.040 --> 29:07.525
the ship. I liked nine months at Fort Leavenworth, 
but I wasn't crazy about it. But I got through quite

29:18.553 --> 29:26.020
easily. Played indoor polo there until I got 
injured.

29:32.647 --> 29:37.292
I got along okay with the ground officers. Was it a 
good learning experience? Good what? Learning

29:41.235 --> 29:44.680
experience? I don't know, not learning anything 
that did me any good. They were fighting the Civil

29:47.324 --> 29:52.652
War over

29:47.324 --> 29:52.652
it. They had these map problems, how you'd get 
across a stream, you know, where would you put your

29:52.672 --> 29:59.281
troops, this, that, and the other. They called it 
map problems, once a week. I used to, you had from

30:03.007 --> 30:07.093
one till five on Fridays to do them. And I'd wrap it 
up at about 3 o'clock and turn my paper in and I got

30:08.305 --> 30:17.254
satisfactory on all of them. But the rest, most 
every other officer would stay there and take the

30:18.695 --> 30:28.885
full five hours, figuring the longer he took, the 
better his solution would be. Well, I decided I'd

30:30.006 --> 30:32.109
try that sometime. So when I had the paper all 
finished about 3 o'clock, I said well I'll take the

30:38.427 --> 30:41.573
other two hours and I'll go over this again. So I 
went through it again and I changed my mind about

30:42.715 --> 30:52.592
where I would put my troops and where I would attack 
from and how I would do it you know. Turned it in at 5

30:52.772 --> 30:56.539
o'clock and I got a U which meant unsatisfactory.

30:58.883 --> 31:01.768
So from then on to hell with that. But basically you 
thought that the school was fighting the past

31:02.558 --> 31:14.230
wars, and do you think it was behind times as far as 
being up to date on modern military tactics? Ah,

31:14.871 --> 31:16.012
mostly. They did introduce, we had some Air Force, 
Air Corps instructors there too, and they had what

31:16.032 --> 31:29.747
they called a vertical envelopment. where you 
drop troops back in the lines, you know,

31:30.622 --> 31:41.375
and secure the river crossing or whatever. But 
very little of it. Mostly ground stuff. Fighting

31:47.203 --> 31:57.255
battles in the Civil War, which they should have

31:47.203 --> 31:57.255
been fought. And perhaps some battles over in 
Europe that During World War I? They were fighting

32:02.206 --> 32:04.528
some of the World War I battles over here? Yeah, 
refighting over here. You don't sound very

32:07.551 --> 32:10.774
enthused about this school. I wasn't very 
enthusiastic about it, no. It was supposed, this

32:13.997 --> 32:23.726
school was supposed to educate you for 
advancement into the general officer corps.

32:23.946 --> 32:25.908
Yeah, advance. Did you think it was worthwhile?

32:29.735 --> 32:33.819
I don't think it's worthwhile for an Air Force 
officer, no. Do you think the school helped your

32:33.839 --> 32:36.302
career? Yeah. Okay, it's time for you two to go 
workshop, and then we'll get some lunch. Well,

32:42.008 --> 32:44.190
let's go to the back. This area is my good area. I 
wonder if you can move that chair. Okay, we're

32:50.757 --> 32:57.784
finishing, or we finished on Panama, and then Your 
next assignment in 1938, you were sent to

32:58.152 --> 33:08.423
Wright-Patterson as a technical, in the 
technical inspection branch. Yeah. Now what were

33:09.164 --> 33:13.609
the major problems that needed inspection at that 
time, do you remember? At that time, they had three

33:13.809 --> 33:26.303
technical, what they called technical 
supervisors, who traveled twice a year to every

33:13.809 --> 33:26.303
Air Force base. to make sure that the Air Force Base 
had all technical orders published by

33:27.481 --> 33:40.035
Wright-Patterson Air Force Base and that they 
were following them out. So they were. And that

33:41.236 --> 33:48.404
they were keeping their aircraft and other 
machineries in good shape. And that's what we were

33:49.285 --> 33:50.866
inspecting. I had with me a Master Sergeant who was 
a very technical man, and he would check the

33:56.675 --> 34:12.317
technical order files and help me look over the 
aircraft and firefighting equipment, etc. Sure.

34:13.098 --> 34:21.891
You were making sure that people were maintaining 
the airplanes properly.

34:21.911 --> 34:22.312
Yeah. I was on that duty until the war started. And 
then my boss in Washington, Barney Giles, called

34:26.122 --> 34:33.311
me up and said, you were coming in here to take my 
place. I'm going to move up next to General Arnold.

34:36.775 --> 34:44.163
And so I became chief of technical inspection for 
the entire Air Force. Right. Now at

34:46.546 --> 34:52.213
Wright-Patterson, before we moved to 
Washington, at Wright-Patterson, were there Any

34:53.240 --> 34:56.683
major problems with the aircraft? Anything that 
you know? No, no, they are just a question of

34:58.385 --> 35:01.088
maintenance. They are right. Patterson 
furnished me an airplane for myself. Sergeant and

35:06.012 --> 35:09.716
I to get around in and they maintained it. I had it 
ready to go on or if it wasn't ready, they'd have

35:09.976 --> 35:14.901
another airplane for me to take. And they were very 
cooperative. I was working, of course, directly

35:23.497 --> 35:25.459
under the Chief of Air Force. Wright-Patterson 
had nothing to do with me except that they

35:26.080 --> 35:34.090
maintained my airplane and they gave me office 
space. That's the only thing they had to do with me.

35:40.878 --> 35:49.588
Now when you moved to Washington D.C. as the Chief 
of Technical Inspection for the Air Force, right

35:40.878 --> 35:49.588
after Pearl Harbor,

35:51.931 --> 35:58.720
and right after the war started, what were the 
major problems to get the Army Air Corps ready for

35:51.931 --> 35:58.720
the war? My worst problem was finding good 
technical inspectors to place in various places

35:59.582 --> 36:14.322
with the various air forces and to find airplanes 
for them to get around in. Because there was a

36:15.363 --> 36:16.845
shortage of airplanes. A shortage of staff 
airplanes. And I went out and I got permission to go

36:19.994 --> 36:31.686
out and buy up any civilian aircraft that I thought 
would be useful for my inspectors to get around in.

36:32.887 --> 36:45.900
And I went over to the

36:32.887 --> 36:45.900
Civil Aeronautics Bureau and enlisted all the 
technical inspectors they would let me have.

36:46.792 --> 36:48.634
which was some help to me. They were all civilians? 
Yes, civilians, inspected. And were they pretty

36:52.599 --> 36:53.820
good? Yeah, they knew the work, yes. They were well 
qualified. And so in this job, did you travel all

36:59.166 --> 37:04.893
over the country inspecting the quality of the Air 
Force? Yes, I was on the go quite a bit, sometimes by

37:05.113 --> 37:12.021
civilian aircraft. Sometimes I could pick up an 
Air Force plane bowling field and get by myself.

37:22.090 --> 37:28.498
One trip out to Anaheim, California that I made in 
an Air Force plane, B.C. 6. When I came back into

37:32.062 --> 37:40.372
Washington, the weather was foul and airplanes 
were stacked up. The civilian airlines had

37:40.512 --> 37:45.418
airplanes stacked up over the field there waiting 
their turns to get in, but the controller at the

37:47.018 --> 38:16.722
Washington airport

37:47.018 --> 38:16.722
gave the bowling field controller

37:47.018 --> 38:16.722
in charge, gave him the

37:47.018 --> 38:16.722
responsibility of getting me on the ground where 
bowling, talking me down, you know. So I got into

38:16.955 --> 38:19.919
bowling all right. Did you, were you able to solve 
the problem of a shortage of aircraft and

38:21.201 --> 38:28.710
inspectors while you were the chief? No, I was only 
in that job about nine months. I was trying to get

38:33.416 --> 38:35.539
out of it the minute I got in it. Why didn't you like 
that job? I just didn't like to be close to the

38:37.602 --> 38:42.388
throne for one thing, that General Arnold Every 
time there was a crack up and somebody was killed, I

38:43.229 --> 38:47.675
was on the carpet. Why? What causes them? I told 
him, but I told him, you are not giving the students

38:51.341 --> 38:59.172
enough time before you commission them and give 
them an airplane. You ought to extend each primary

38:59.432 --> 39:06.402
flying...

39:08.120 --> 39:10.402
basic flying and advanced flying. Each stage 
should have one extra week of training before

39:11.163 --> 39:18.570
these youngsters are put in an aircraft on their 
own. Well, General Arnold, he had the newspapers

39:19.952 --> 39:24.917
on his neck all the time. Roosevelt went, hurry up, 
hurry up, hurry up. And so I wasn't able to put that

39:29.982 --> 39:34.566
across.

39:36.352 --> 39:41.439
He expected me to go out and find out what caused 
these wrecks and correct it. Well, I couldn't do

39:41.499 --> 39:42.481
it. And you kept telling him it was because they 
weren't trained well enough. That's absolutely

39:46.206 --> 39:48.069
what I told him. And so I got pretty sick of that. How 
did you like General Arnold? I liked him all right.

39:55.599 --> 39:57.742
I had other generals I liked better. Why? Well, 
General Arnold had his ear... trained on the White

40:05.039 --> 40:17.733
House, Roosevelt, was talking into his ear and the 
newspapers were on Roosevelt's neck, I guess, and

40:05.039 --> 40:17.733
also on Arnold's neck about these crack-ups. And 
if I'd been Arnold, I would have told him to shut up

40:19.114 --> 40:26.843
and go to hell or do something. But instead of that, 
what he tried to make me, the goat, getting these

40:33.828 --> 40:35.951
things, these accidents stopped. There was no 
such way I could do it. So you think he passed the

40:41.439 --> 40:43.983
buck too much to you? Well, he had just, he had a hell 
of a job, you know, at the start of the war. I don't, I

40:50.272 --> 40:54.218
can't blame him. Okay.

40:57.883 --> 41:02.350
You also know another person, and that was General 
Jeremy Doolittle, what did you think of him? I

41:05.695 --> 41:12.883
think he was probably the best Air Force general we 
had, really, during the war. No kidding. Why do you

41:13.444 --> 41:14.185
say that? He was just a natural born leader. He 
could do anything he asked his men to do and do it

41:17.889 --> 41:21.072
better. And he just, he was, men loved to work for 
him. They loved to be under him. I enjoyed my stay

41:33.262 --> 41:39.830
with him very much.

41:39.990 --> 41:51.964
He was my type of officer and the main thing is to 
give a man a job and don't be looking over his

41:39.990 --> 41:51.964
shoulder while he's doing it. Give him the 
responsibility of the job and if he doesn't do it,

41:53.126 --> 42:03.218
we'll find out why and if it happens again, we'll 
boot him out and get somebody else. Well that's

42:03.468 --> 42:05.691
what, that's Jimmy Doolittle all the way. And 
that's the type of leader you were? Well yeah, I

42:08.394 --> 42:12.419
tried to be that way. In July of 1942, you took an 
inspection trip, I'll get it right, inspection

42:12.719 --> 42:20.829
trip to England. And what were you inspecting? You 
mentioned this in your memoirs, but you don't

42:23.312 --> 42:25.975
explain. I was inspecting the various bases for 
technical

42:34.282 --> 42:42.951
supervision,

42:34.282 --> 42:42.951
technical, how they were getting along from the 
technical standpoint. That was my job. Were there

42:44.132 --> 42:47.675
RAF, Royal Air Force bases? No, they were all 
American bases. There was Newfoundland, and

42:50.498 --> 42:59.547
there was Labrador. and two bases in Greenland. 
One was called BW-1 and one was called BW-8. I never

43:05.512 --> 43:08.294
found out what the BW stood for. But one was at the 
southern tip of Greenland and one was up the west

43:09.295 --> 43:19.705
coast of Greenland about a couple hundred 
kilometers, I guess, up the west coast, up above

43:09.295 --> 43:19.705
the Arctic Circle. And up there they

43:20.726 --> 43:30.495
had Colonel Bert Balken, who was a native of 
Norway, was up there with the dog team and sleds to

43:31.420 --> 43:44.857
go out on the ice cap with Newt and Greenland and 
rescue any crews that went down on the ice cap. And

43:44.877 --> 43:46.779
he was a man for the job. He did a fine job on that. Did 
he rescue people? Yeah, he rescued, I don't think

43:52.406 --> 43:55.470
we, I don't recall that we ever lost a crew 
permanently on that ice cap. I think we rescued all

44:01.402 --> 44:02.924
of them. Great. What were the conditions when you 
did this inspection in July 1942? What were the

44:07.690 --> 44:08.972
conditions? Very excellent. Excellent. 
Excellent. Well, that was pretty quick.

44:14.460 --> 44:15.501
Everybody amazed me. It was in July when the war 
started in December. Just six months of May, I had

44:21.573 --> 44:25.899
everything working like clockwork. No kidding. 
That's outstanding. I did an outstanding job.

44:31.706 --> 44:41.539
Now, as you say, you were an inspection, chief of 
the inspection for just about nine months, and

44:31.706 --> 44:41.539
then you volunteered more or less for North 
Africa. Yes, I got a hold of Jimmy Doolittle and in

44:44.945 --> 44:51.432
the corridors there of the munitions building and 
I told him I wanted to get to England in this war. I

44:51.612 --> 44:59.321
said, I spent the last war in this country as a 
flying instructor and it looks like I'm stuck in

44:51.612 --> 44:59.321
Washington here for this one and I want to get out. 
And he said, well, have you got somebody to take

45:00.282 --> 45:02.584
your place? And I said, yeah, I got somebody. He 
said, all right, I'll put in for you. And that's the

45:07.670 --> 45:09.012
way it happened. And so he took you on. Yeah. And 
exactly, what was your... Well, the first week I

45:15.370 --> 45:24.878
was over in England the 12th Air Force had not been 
formed yet completely. The 8th Air Force was in

45:25.078 --> 45:44.955
England and he signed me to the 8th Air Force as 
Inspector General and I spent a week going around

45:25.078 --> 45:44.955
various bases in England to look over how the 
Americans were doing from a technical

45:25.078 --> 45:44.955
standpoint. and then about a week or ten days while 
the 12th Air Force was formed for the invasion of

45:45.188 --> 46:01.132
Africa with General Doolittle as commanding 
general, and I was assigned to the A-4 section,

45:45.188 --> 46:01.132
which is supply and maintenance. Okay, so by this 
time you were a lieutenant colonel, or were you

46:01.152 --> 46:07.202
promoted now to colonel? I was a colonel, I think. 
Okay, colonel and... I just don't know exactly

46:13.268 --> 46:17.714
when I was promoted from lieutenant colonel to 
colonel. Okay, colonel and the 12th. Yeah. And

46:22.501 --> 46:25.445
Dulo was the general and commanding officer. 
Yeah. And how many colonels did he have on his

46:26.206 --> 46:29.070
staff? I don't know, but he had General Dunton, who 
was my immediate boss. General Dunton was A-4 in

46:34.538 --> 46:38.684
charge of supply and maintenance. And General 
Dunton had myself and two other colonels to head up

46:41.112 --> 46:59.509
three different sections under him.
