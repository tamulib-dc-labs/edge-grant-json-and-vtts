WEBVTT

00:01.567 --> 00:08.213
The only money they have is getting lifetime 
memberships, and most of them sold them too cheap.

00:08.233 --> 00:10.375
Yeah, I expect some. Okay, so things are really, 
let's say, becoming professionalized in the

00:11.096 --> 00:20.324
association and the money-raising activities. 
Well, meanwhile, I developed a staff. Ms.

00:22.846 --> 00:30.052
Shepherd got sick, and Delucia had been my 
neighbor over on Suffolk Street, and I didn't know

00:22.846 --> 00:30.052
her well. I just knew her. her as a person, and her 
husband was very ill at the time. And I knew she was

00:34.290 --> 00:37.094
taking him to the hospitals a lot. He was a 
veterinarian with the USDA. And she was running,

00:41.079 --> 00:48.148
after they separated, she was running the 
cafeteria in the MSC. And I had Joe Buser as editor.

00:53.596 --> 00:55.358
And then by this time, I'd had a couple more. We kept 
upgrading the magazine at the time. Well, I tried

00:58.322 --> 01:01.206
to get that magazine in a comfortable big time. 
Basically, the only criticism I've ever gotten on

01:01.692 --> 01:05.639
the magazine is we do a lot of fundraising in it. But 
after all, the former student's budget is what

01:05.679 --> 01:10.347
supports the magazine. And the foundation and the 
12th Man Foundation, they pay for their ads in

01:11.289 --> 01:16.238
there. So that magazine's expensive. God, that 
printing. And we use that color process all the

01:19.624 --> 01:21.608
time. And oh, I want to tell you about this 
University of Pennsylvania. When we got ready to

01:27.629 --> 01:34.756
print the first directory, we went directly from 
the address graph plates right smack into tape on

01:27.629 --> 01:34.756
the computer. Went to the 7094, went to 709 first 
and then 7094. But we went from address graph

01:38.941 --> 01:42.644
plates from a questionnaire to a punch card. And 
the punch cards is how we went on tape. So in 1966 we

01:47.269 --> 01:52.995
were getting ready to print a directory, and Frank 
Cheryl from Dallas, had introduced me to a guy

01:53.279 --> 02:03.087
named Bill Mason from Flower Town, Pennsylvania, 
who was a pioneer in the world of photo line

01:53.279 --> 02:03.087
typesetting. It hadn't really hit off yet, 
because the old cold and hot typesetters were

02:04.048 --> 02:11.855
fighting it like crazy. And he said, it's the wave 
of the future. So I called him and said, I met you in

02:14.317 --> 02:21.203
Fort Worth with Frank Cheryl, who was a 
typesetter. And he said, yeah, I remember you. I

02:23.435 --> 02:27.400
said, well, we're ready to talk to you now about 
setting the time for this directly. He said, well,

02:27.420 --> 02:30.504
bring me a loop of tape up here. And he said, come on 
up, spend a couple of days with me. So I stayed with

02:33.448 --> 02:34.710
him in his house. I'd been in a meeting in 
Washington with the American Alumni Council. I

02:37.754 --> 02:39.857
took the bus up to Philadelphia. And then he met me 
at the bus station and went up to his house in

02:40.618 --> 02:43.782
Florentine. Oh, he had this damn thing. I was 
really impressed with that whole thing. So I

02:48.869 --> 02:49.850
stayed there a couple of days. And he ran it and ran 
it and ran it. Boy, it was looking good. And he said,

02:53.725 --> 02:56.148
boy, I'm sure happy to have this book. He had a hell 
of a time financing his company, because these

02:56.388 --> 03:00.494
people were too leery of him. He was too much way 
ahead of his time. And he finally went and broke

03:03.317 --> 03:04.459
them. And I think some printers picked him up, and 
he survived the thing somehow. But our book helped

03:10.126 --> 03:11.888
him. Our book really helped. We had the first 
alumni directory on Earth printed by a computer

03:13.230 --> 03:18.417
tape. Type was set by it. And he had those great big 
lights and all this stuff. Photos were in a line.

03:26.791 --> 03:29.175
That's why I call it a photo line typesetting. They 
call it something else now. But anyway, I stopped

03:30.637 --> 03:39.192
by the University of Pennsylvania and thanked 
those people for their ideas about the annual

03:30.637 --> 03:39.192
giving and their $100 and their Ben Franklin. I 
said, I called mine the Century Club. And they'd

03:40.915 --> 03:42.838
say, oh, we know all about it. I said, you made it 
more successful than we did. So I told them about my

03:45.532 --> 03:51.141
directory, and they said, who's doing that? I 
said, aren't you on tape yet? They said, yeah,

03:53.445 --> 03:57.372
we're on tape, but we're not doing much with it. 
They said, we certainly don't print a directory or

03:59.175 --> 04:02.640
anything like that with it. Who's doing it? I said, 
one of your alumni named Bill Mason in the class of

04:03.923 --> 04:10.273
1939 over in Flyertown. They said, Bill Mason, we 
never heard of him. I said, well, you can call him.

04:13.653 --> 04:21.941
It would be nice for you to go out and visit with him 
and look at his setup, because he'll help you do a

04:13.653 --> 04:21.941
lot of things with your computer in the way of 
typesetting and design. So that was really an

04:22.821 --> 04:26.645
interesting little sideline of getting 
computers done. But those pioneer days. So my

04:28.387 --> 04:34.653
little story, and Doug Yager was the graduate 
student that did the conversion from dress,

04:28.387 --> 04:34.653
graph, tooth. See, his thesis was about like that, 
and for which he got all kinds of awards from IBM and

04:34.673 --> 04:40.378
everybody else. I'd take my questionnaire and 
directory, and I said, here it is. Between this

04:44.059 --> 04:48.286
questionnaire and this directory is a very, very 
complicated matter. But I said, it's worth it.

04:50.970 --> 04:57.080
That 67 book was printed by computer, and ever 
since then we've been doing it. But we got really

04:58.121 --> 05:04.692
high in the computer field with that first 
directory. That was real. That's interesting.

05:09.788 --> 05:12.912
The only woman over there that still went to 
Stardust is Jean Sher. She went through it all. She

05:14.455 --> 05:17.018
started from the very beginning in the 60s. See, 
Dick left in 64. They listed in 63, and they listed

05:21.925 --> 05:24.249
in 64. He really left in 64. I mean, it's got to 
change gears for just a second. What was your

05:31.118 --> 05:35.745
involvement with athletic activities and 
programs as a former student? Well, we had to

05:36.029 --> 05:39.533
conduct all the coaches' nights. We took the coach 
around to the clubs and all that stuff, and they all

05:39.774 --> 05:46.923
wanted to see the coach, because we wanted to come 
and buy tickets and fill the stadium up. That's

05:46.963 --> 05:47.964
what we were trying to do. And get them to charter 
buses and bring buses, bring people in for games

05:48.665 --> 05:54.713
and all that kind of stuff. So the involvement was 
fundraising for the stadium, for the Letterman's

06:01.662 --> 06:05.086
Association. They didn't have anything like 
that. They just had a group that selected the Hall

06:08.610 --> 06:11.053
of Fame. That's how it goes. See, Fulberg wanted 
two things started. That was a Hall of Fame and a

06:14.057 --> 06:23.048
Letterman's Association Hall of Fame and the 
quarterback club. Well, the quarterback club was

06:24.189 --> 06:25.551
easy. I just called about five guys and had lunch 
with them and said, here's a proposal. And if

06:30.856 --> 06:36.905
you're interested in this, and Coach, I said, 
Coach Folberg is ready here to talk to you how he

06:30.856 --> 06:36.905
wants to use it. And so they grabbed that like a, at 
least I got out of that. Damn, I thought I was going

06:40.790 --> 06:43.454
to have to do that too. Because he asked me to do it. I 
said, no, I said, it's better to have volunteers do

06:44.756 --> 06:47.100
this. That's what you want. And so we go back to the 
other stuff, the Hall of Fame. We couldn't get the

06:54.090 --> 06:57.114
Lettermen to take any interest because they 
wouldn't pay any dues. Well, we had to have some

06:57.374 --> 07:00.559
dues to hire a secretary, see? And so I was having to 
do that work, getting a folder printed. See, I'm

07:04.988 --> 07:07.832
using former student money for athletics and for 
everything else. Plus, we'd have to process the

07:08.253 --> 07:11.257
gifts. People would make money to, so it was a 
restricted gift. We'd have to process and write to

07:14.701 --> 07:20.589
the agency or whatever who was ever going to do the 
work. Now, they had the Aggie Club was there, but

07:21.370 --> 07:27.117
nobody was doing anything with it. We didn't even 
have a secretary. We had a part-time secretary.

07:30.492 --> 07:36.741
which was my roommate, and then Marion Pugh, and 
then Homer Adams was in there someplace, but he

07:30.492 --> 07:36.741
lies a lot. And then there was John Hopkins was the 
first one. When Stallings came, Stallings called

07:41.809 --> 07:46.616
me one day and said, say, oh, this is interesting. 
You know this TAM? Well, I stole that from TCU. and

07:52.598 --> 08:18.302
you see the the thing about tcu it doesn't look very 
good and they were using they were using this big

07:52.598 --> 08:18.302
block t like this and they're using a c over here and 
u well that didn't look very damn good and so i one

07:52.598 --> 08:18.302
day i'd i'd do it like this and i wrote a m now that 
looks nice because you got the flow downwards see

07:52.598 --> 08:18.302
here it it looks clumsy see and so uh oh the glide 
folks So anyway, I didn't say anything to anybody.

08:20.738 --> 08:23.221
I just started using this on mailing pieces and 
just using it. I didn't put it on stationery. I was

08:25.503 --> 08:26.925
using the seal for that. I used a former student 
seal, or the university seal with former students

08:27.245 --> 08:32.191
wrapped around it, see? And I just started using 
this on various and sundry mailing pieces. And I

08:36.956 --> 08:42.602
got a letter one day from Clyde Post that says, you 
dirty rat. Why have you stolen our logo? I know he

08:45.375 --> 08:46.536
found out. I called him, and I said, Clyde, I said, I 
didn't steal your logo. I said, I'm using AM

08:51.422 --> 08:55.526
instead of C. I said, your CU doesn't look good 
anyway. That's not a very good looking damn thing.

08:58.189 --> 08:59.931
I said, do you have a copyright on it? He said, no. I 
said, well, then why can't I use it? He said, oh,

09:02.715 --> 09:05.137
hell, I know once you start it, you won't quit now. 
So they then changed their logo to the one that you

09:07.180 --> 09:11.745
see they have now. Yeah, I have seen that. That's a 
good one. They make it white on the side of their

09:16.012 --> 09:19.375
football helmets and stuff. But anyway, this was 
the original. I stole that from TCU. Yeah, well,

09:25.021 --> 09:28.164
see, that looks good. This looks terrible. You 
would think this had been there all the time.

09:32.769 --> 09:33.230
Hasn't. I think I started using it in 1960. maybe 
two or three early, right after I'd been here about

09:37.342 --> 09:40.345
a year. Whenever I saw that TCU on the helmets, I 
thought, damn, AM would look like that. That

09:44.209 --> 09:44.970
doesn't look right. It would look good if you had 
two years under it. Now, that might look better.

09:49.595 --> 09:51.096
But the AM really looked nice. And so Stallings 
called me and said, say, I know some of that stuff

09:51.737 --> 09:56.782
you got around here. Willard Clark made some 
jewelry with it and all that stuff. He said, could I

10:00.126 --> 10:02.508
use that on the football helmets? I said, sure. I 
said, there's no copyright on anything. I said,

10:05.783 --> 10:07.165
now there is now, I think. But I said, anybody, you 
can use it, sure. I said, get a decal company, and

10:10.670 --> 10:14.736
I'll give you some names of them. I always said, 
give that to whoever, Bones or Wally. I guess

10:19.763 --> 10:20.504
Wally. I said, give it to them. So I gave them the 
names of these decal companies. They'll make you

10:23.969 --> 10:26.513
the decals and show you how to mount them. Billy 
Pickard will do that. Monk Meeks, I think, was down

10:27.795 --> 10:29.978
there then. So I was involved with the athletic 
department on the coaches' nights and on the

10:30.650 --> 10:35.835
meetings. In fact, on the council meetings, we'd 
always have the head coach come over. So we were

10:38.738 --> 10:40.620
interlocked. But that proved me more and more that 
we got to get a full-time person with the Aggie

10:40.800 --> 10:44.664
Club. So Stallings was all for it. And I said, well, 
if you can't make the budget on painting the first

10:46.907 --> 10:57.838
year, I said, give me a budget or something, and 
I'll help you with money from the former students.

10:57.937 --> 10:59.839
I said, we've got to get this off our backs. And he 
said, let me look around. So there was a classmate

11:02.482 --> 11:04.865
of his named John Hopkins. And John was hired as the 
first full-time secretary for the Aggie Club. And

11:13.255 --> 11:15.718
he had a couple assistants. And John's problem was 
he got so damn authoritative, and he got so

11:15.738 --> 11:20.784
possessive. For example, he'd hurt people's 
feelings. The whole thing was wrapped around, by

11:26.523 --> 11:31.386
God, you've got to pay so-and-so, or you're done. 
You've got to be more diplomatic. When you're

11:33.760 --> 11:36.383
fundraising, you can't hurt people's feelings 
somehow. You've got to kiss their ass the whole

11:36.403 --> 11:38.825
time. They may not like the smell, but God damn it, 
you better have your nose plugged up like that when

11:38.845 --> 11:47.795
you kiss them. So anyway, this is the story of TAM. 
What I want to ask you, too, about the athletic

11:52.320 --> 12:01.170
thing is, did you feel much heat or pressure as 
director of former students from former students

12:01.522 --> 12:07.649
who felt like the former students should exercise 
greater control or influence or whatever over

12:01.522 --> 12:07.649
athletic programs. Was there a lot of rub there, a 
lot of pressure? Yeah. And they felt that we ought

12:13.917 --> 12:20.445
to have more authority, we ought to have more say, 
more input. And that kind of puts you in a tight spot

12:20.545 --> 12:23.429
between the two. I would guess it would. I'd get my 
weekly phone call from a local lawyer here, and

12:24.570 --> 12:29.436
he'd say, You son of a bitch, you've done it to me 
again. And hang up the phone every time we lose a

12:31.902 --> 12:34.060
game, see? So then I'd call back and say, now, Ed, Ed 
Davis, so why don't you call me? Why don't you call

12:38.403 --> 12:39.545
the coach? He said, hell, I can't call the coach. He 
won't talk to anybody. I can't call the president.

12:43.271 --> 12:45.474
Hell, he'd say, this is not my thing. I said, he 
said, you're the only son of a bitch I pay out there.

12:49.380 --> 12:50.782
Your job is to get that. That's a good point. Every 
time you lose a football game, it's your goddamn

12:51.804 --> 12:54.729
fault. So you're kind of a hang guy. He said, why 
don't you fire that son of a bitch? I bet you caught a

12:58.575 --> 12:59.697
lot of heat. Oh, I did. Just awful. We were losing so 
much, it was changing a lot of coaches and so on.

13:05.343 --> 13:06.004
Yeah, it was tough, tough. My biggest problem was 
getting involved in the Ballard affair. Because

13:10.549 --> 13:15.374
we had a lot of former students who were crazy about 
him, but liked him, hated to see him go. But then

13:16.535 --> 13:20.580
there's the powerful boys, hated that wishbone 
formation. They wanted us to use the T-set,

13:20.620 --> 13:22.982
pro-set, you know. And the eye, oh, God, it was big. 
And here, they were telling Dr. Williams, he said,

13:25.805 --> 13:31.131
we have a Director of Athletics, which was then the 
coach. That was bad. They should never have had

13:35.887 --> 13:37.609
that. But that's the only way they could get Bear 
Bryant. Bear Bryant had been browbeaten by that

13:39.310 --> 13:44.275
basketball coach at Kentucky, see, Doc Rupp. What 
is it? Doc Ruff? Ruff? Ruff? Whoever the

13:48.119 --> 13:51.202
basketball hero was there. And so there was a lot of 
consternation. Yeah, former students have

13:54.125 --> 13:56.767
always been involved. Now, we're not so much now 
since the 12th Man Foundation. Tubman now has over

14:01.115 --> 14:07.023
$18 million in endowments for the 12-man 
scholarships. And that's strictly athletic.

14:08.806 --> 14:10.107
Strictly athletic, right. Income from that goes 
to the athletic department. Dr. Williams met with

14:13.051 --> 14:14.373
them. He said to me, he said, what should I tell 
these people? And I said, Dr. Williams, I think you

14:18.239 --> 14:30.936
should tell them that the best program that they 
can latch onto is to set up an endowment for every

14:31.658 --> 14:35.181
athletic scholarship. Of course, he didn't 
realize they were going to have all these women's

14:35.421 --> 14:39.705
programs and all the other things. It would 
double, triple the whole budget. Now we've got a

14:41.607 --> 14:45.470
$14 million budget now for the athletic 
department. That's staggering, see? And he said,

14:47.392 --> 15:00.163
I think, he said, if the former students can endow 
the president's scholarships, why can't the

14:47.392 --> 15:00.163
Aggie Club endow the 12th Man Scholarship? And so 
he met with their board, and that's what he told

15:01.105 --> 15:04.069
them, and that's what launched it. Well, they had a 
bad guy over there. He was a bad guy. And so the job

15:08.895 --> 15:13.381
was open, and I helped get him fired. He was wearing 
a fake Aggie ring, and so I had an anonymous photo.

15:21.111 --> 15:22.773
The guy was not an Aggie at all? Yeah, he'd been here 
for three years.

15:28.080 --> 15:29.121
His roommate... was Ross Margraves, who's 
chairman of the Board of Regents. That was his

15:32.506 --> 15:33.607
roommate. And Ross Margraves called someone and 
said, who's chairman of the Ring Committee? They

15:37.511 --> 15:38.492
said, Buck Meyers. And he said, well, you call him 
and tell him to check on Don Brister's ring. So I

15:44.118 --> 15:46.480
called over to Registrar's office. Now, let me 
tell you how secure things aren't. I called over to

15:52.306 --> 15:53.788
Registrar's office. Now, someone in my office, I 
guess, heard me talking.

16:00.235 --> 16:01.597
And I used that name, Brister. And I called over to 
Ed Cooper, to the registrar, and I said, I want you

16:02.257 --> 16:12.729
to pull a transcript of Don Brister, class 63. And 
I'll be right over. I want to look at it. I don't want

16:14.811 --> 16:16.173
to listen to it on the phone. So I walked over to the 
Koch building, and they had Brister's. Shit, he

16:20.818 --> 16:22.800
had 68 hours. And I don't know how many grade 
points, but it was pretty bad. And he was saying,

16:27.522 --> 16:29.925
Aggie Ring, you can't order until you get 92. It was 
96 hours. Then it's 93 hours now.

16:36.934 --> 16:38.155
And so I walked back. When I got back to my office, 
Brister was in my office. How the hell did he know

16:42.761 --> 16:43.862
that? See, the only people who knew were the 
registrar in my office. Someone leaked. See, can

16:48.568 --> 16:50.550
you imagine the president of the United States? I 
can see now. How are those things going to happen?

16:53.974 --> 16:55.136
Just imagine. I don't think you can secure 
anything. under the threat of death, maybe, but I

16:57.442 --> 17:00.106
don't know how, boy. So he was in my office, and he 
says, what should I do? I said, well, number one,

17:02.970 --> 17:06.996
throw that damn ring in the Brazos River. Divest 
yourself of it. Destroy it. Lose it. Number two,

17:11.282 --> 17:19.734
call your president, Bob Little, in Houston, and 
ask him to call a board meeting, executive

17:11.282 --> 17:19.734
committee meeting from the board, and resign. I 
said, you have no business walking around here

17:20.395 --> 17:23.580
with a fake Aggie ring on. I said, that's awfully, 
awfully... Devious, nothing else. Dishonest.

17:32.909 --> 17:33.730
It's a terrible thing. I said, if people knew that, 
it would just be a scandal. I said, let's don't have

17:37.054 --> 17:38.536
any scandal. Let's don't publicize it. Just 
resign. Well, he called Bob Little, and they met,

17:42.001 --> 17:45.725
and of course they got rid of him. At that time, 
Harry Green was flopping around out here between

17:46.767 --> 17:53.054
hotels and the real estate business. It had gone 
broke under Bob Baker and the Arnold boys.

17:57.128 --> 18:08.882
Aggieland Inn had gone under, and so I wrote a 
letter to Bob Little, and Bob Little told me, he

17:57.128 --> 18:08.882
said, you really fucked up that ring job. I said, I 
did. He said, yes, why didn't you call me? I said, I

18:13.247 --> 18:14.769
didn't have a chance to. I said, by the time I found 
out what his grades were and all that stuff and came

18:15.389 --> 18:22.157
back to my office, he was waiting for me there. So I 
told him to bail out. He said, well, I should have

18:24.753 --> 18:26.555
been notified first. And I said, well, I'm sorry. 
It just didn't work out that way. I said, it wasn't

18:29.660 --> 18:30.941
that I didn't want to. I was coming back to the 
office to call you. But I saw no reason to call you

18:33.965 --> 18:36.449
with the man standing there. And I said, he called 
you, didn't he? He said, yeah, sure did. He said,

18:40.034 --> 18:45.461
well, he said, I was just mad as hell at you for not 
letting me know that. So, you know, I get help for

18:45.481 --> 18:47.584
whatever. Yeah, I bet you did, but I have pressure 
in me. No, the coaching pressure is like it is in any

18:51.213 --> 18:54.417
big school. The alumni are in the middle of it. The 
big thing is we've got the money separated, and

18:56.960 --> 18:59.964
that's good. How about the budget of the former 
Students Association? Do you remember any growth

19:04.649 --> 19:07.032
rates? I can get the figures, but just as a general. 
Well, boy, listen, when I came there, we just

19:10.917 --> 19:14.401
didn't have any money. We had some university 
commitments. We had the loan fund to administer

19:17.805 --> 19:21.169
and the student loan fund. See, when Bob Walker 
went over, we moved the loan fund over. Oh, no, no,

19:25.755 --> 19:27.257
no, no, no, no. When the student aid office, now 
Rudder was good about that, except he wouldn't pay

19:27.977 --> 19:32.243
anybody anything. When we got the student aid 
office set up, Bob Logan was the first one hired.

19:38.110 --> 19:43.676
Rudder tried to hire Bob Murray, Juanita Murray's 
husband. And he wouldn't give him anything, but

19:43.696 --> 19:48.422
he'd say, well, he'd been a counselor, a civilian 
student counselor. And you know, they don't work

19:49.195 --> 19:52.278
much, and it's kind of a bullshit job. But where he 
asked him what salary, and the runner said, well,

19:52.699 --> 19:58.324
you have to come at your same salary. And Bob says, 
well, it is now. He said, I'm given quite a bit of

20:01.107 --> 20:02.689
freedom. He said, I'd expect to get a little raise 
or something. And the runner said, it's all I can do

20:06.312 --> 20:09.576
right now, either take it or leave it. Bob says, 
well, I think I'll leave it. Well, he died a year

20:12.218 --> 20:13.279
later. He was a World War II hero, shot all to 
pieces. He had a heart attack. So Bob Logan, we

20:19.435 --> 20:33.975
transferred the student loan program and all the 
opportunity where scholarships went from

20:19.435 --> 20:33.975
development to him, to the administration of all 
scholarships came out of the Student Financial

20:19.435 --> 20:33.975
Aid, finally where they should be. They shouldn't 
be run by development. They shouldn't be run by the

20:35.958 --> 20:37.319
former students. They ought to be run by the 
university. What was roughly the income of the

20:39.162 --> 20:42.306
former students when you came? Do you have any 
idea? Yeah, I sure do. It's right here. I sure do.

20:48.196 --> 20:48.957
It's all right here. John did a good job on this 
thing. What do I got in here?

20:57.905 --> 20:58.385
I'll be darned. I got all kinds of crap in here. I've 
used this. I get stuff out of here for speeches all

21:02.970 --> 21:05.192
the time. And yeah, we've got it in here someplace. 
I can dig it out of there. No, I'd like to. What I was

21:13.500 --> 21:17.083
saying is what it was when you came and what it was 
when you... Yeah, I think we got all of that. I think

21:20.446 --> 21:21.627
we got all of that. For

21:23.569 --> 21:27.693
the presidency. We've

21:27.713 --> 21:37.403
even got campus muster speakers in here. Okay, 
it's got to be further back in here. Century Club

21:41.307 --> 21:47.593
memberships.

21:50.257 --> 21:52.320
We had a total of 370 in 1977.

21:56.908 --> 22:01.556
We had 7,347, and I don't know what we had in 1980. 
370

22:01.576 --> 22:05.602
to 7,347. Oh, no.

22:11.772 --> 22:13.115
The year before that, we had 8,355. We dropped. 
from 76 to 77. See, 76 was the centennial year, and

22:17.169 --> 22:21.260
that was a big point. Yeah, that's right. We jumped 
335 between 75 and 76, so 8,355 in 76. That's the

22:30.385 --> 22:31.987
century club memberships. That includes the 
silver, bronze, silver, gold, diamond, and so on.

22:42.559 --> 22:43.480
You retired when? In 80. In 80. And what was, let's 
say, the income of the former Students

22:45.442 --> 22:50.368
Association in that year, roughly? I don't even 
know what you mean. We've got it in here.

22:56.876 --> 22:58.097
I think we do, yeah. Oh, not 1980. This book only 
went to some... I'm just saying some number that

23:02.556 --> 23:05.441
you remember that would be... I don't remember. 
You don't remember? I'll find it, that's all

23:07.945 --> 23:10.008
right. And most of the money, most of the income of 
the former students, would you say that was

23:10.969 --> 23:17.079
dedicated income? I know you were doing the 
faculty awards. for example, like we were doing

23:20.825 --> 23:23.149
with scholarships. All that money, the money we 
spend is unrestricted money. Unless someone

23:26.674 --> 23:28.717
gives to a program. And then it's dedicated. They 
give to a program. Then that money is dedicated for

23:31.541 --> 23:33.404
that program. It's restricted for that purpose. 
What do you think has been the major, I guess you

23:36.569 --> 23:48.307
would say, accomplishment, or role, or purpose, 
or goal of the former Students Association in its

23:36.569 --> 23:48.307
relationship to Texas A&M? I got it. OK. The 
greatest thing that the Association of Former

23:51.250 --> 24:06.625
Students ever did for Texas A&M University was 
after the long-range study I told you about that

23:51.250 --> 24:06.625
recommended we have a full-time director, that we 
publish a magazine, we have distinguished alumni

23:51.250 --> 24:06.625
awards, and all these programs, a magazine, and so 
on. In that study, it said, however, we can't

24:07.186 --> 24:15.234
progress with our projects until the university 
determines its future. Unless the university

24:15.414 --> 24:18.237
sets its goals inside and has long-range plans on 
what it intends to be by the centennial in 1976,

24:18.554 --> 24:30.069
we recommend that the university have a 
self-study to determine its future. That was the

24:31.330 --> 24:40.482
greatest statement ever made because the Board of 
Regents took that and said, OK, but will you help

24:31.330 --> 24:40.482
us? And we said, former student says, yes, sir. We 
will do two things. They said, we think that the

24:44.507 --> 24:47.110
governor ought to appoint a study of 100 people to 
the century study, which will give the goals by the

24:47.613 --> 24:58.728
completion of the century in 1976 of the 
university. We'll call that the Century Council.

25:03.895 --> 25:08.061
Half former students and half Texans. Half of 
them, the former students, will recommend to the

25:08.241 --> 25:10.865
governor. The other half, the governor should 
recommend himself with a certain percentage of

25:14.917 --> 25:17.019
women. We think women ought to be appointed to this 
study also.

25:25.689 --> 25:37.742
Then the former students gave a $50,000 budget to 
the university to hire a full-time man in

25:25.689 --> 25:37.742
secretary, and that man was Robert L. Hunt, Jr. I 
forget what he was doing at that time. His dad was

25:42.787 --> 25:44.569
quite a beloved, famous old I guess an agronomy 
professor or something like that. And this

25:50.088 --> 26:13.594
launched a study that took a year long with 
subcommittee meetings and so on, and they

25:50.088 --> 26:13.594
produced the Blueprint for Progress, which 
outlined the recommendations of the composition

25:50.088 --> 26:13.594
of the student body, the changing of the status, 
the name of the university, the Anacostia

25:50.088 --> 26:13.594
Mechanic College of Texas to Texas A&M 
University. And now, this is recommended to the

26:14.080 --> 26:22.011
regents by this Blueprint for Progress, which is a 
result of the Century Council. That is what's set,

26:22.312 --> 26:42.461
and we recommend that the university be 
restructured into colleges according to degree

26:22.312 --> 26:42.461
programs, like liberal arts, like science, like 
agriculture, engineering, architecture,

26:22.312 --> 26:42.461
science and education, and veterinary medicine, 
like architecture. See, many of these. divisions

26:44.152 --> 26:50.038
were inside of the School of Arts and Sciences, 
School of Engineering, and School of something.

26:50.959 --> 26:57.226
They were not colleges, degree-granting 
colleges. So we wanted to get the university,

26:57.727 --> 26:59.869
certainly, by 76. Well, you know how fast that was 
done. It was done next year. And we recommended

27:04.294 --> 27:08.478
also that the women be admitted. And see, the 
former students had to get that resolution passed

27:12.367 --> 27:13.769
through the council. And that story is John 
Lindsay was president of the association, and Bob

27:15.090 --> 27:26.262
Latimer helped me write the resolution, because 
he said, let me do it, let me do it, and was

27:15.090 --> 27:26.262
recommending that we urge the board. And then, of 
course, with that recommendation, the century

27:27.423 --> 27:32.749
council had the support of the former students. 
You remember when that resolution came out of the

27:34.451 --> 27:37.334
former students? In other words, you're in 64. In 
64. Uh-huh. When John Lindsay was, no, no, yeah,

27:40.413 --> 27:44.359
64, that's right. The fall council meeting, 
because President Rudder said, I have to have this

27:44.639 --> 27:53.232
support for the former students before we can take 
it to the regents, because that's the first thing

27:44.639 --> 27:53.232
the regents are going to ask me. Because he talked 
with the president of BPI. See, they'd gone

27:57.498 --> 27:59.501
through that up there. They got the governor in. 
They fired everybody. A terrible time. Oh, it was

28:03.667 --> 28:06.151
awful. I don't know. Yeah, I ran into the guy that 
did the BPI, one of the BPI histories, I think, and

28:07.328 --> 28:14.739
he and I compared those, and I mean, right down, 
even Auburn, incidentally. Yeah, same thing. The

28:15.881 --> 28:17.203
history was really similar. These land-grant 
schools, especially in the South? Yeah. Let's

28:21.510 --> 28:28.821
see, 64, yeah, John H. Lindsay, Class 44, was 
president. And, oh, we had some tough times around

28:28.841 --> 28:33.428
here. I think I had more stress over that. I went to 
Beaumont. I went to Beaumont and was literally ran

28:37.642 --> 28:41.166
out of town. I heard that story. And I almost named 
the man who... Charlie Babcock. Who nailed you.

28:49.255 --> 28:54.120
Oh, listen, I was fired probably sometimes 
several times a day. I'll get you fired. Because

28:57.945 --> 28:58.726
they'd ask me. See, I'd tell them what the council, 
what the association, what the central council.

29:05.153 --> 29:05.533
And... what direction the university was going. 
What do you personally think? I said, well, I

29:10.434 --> 29:13.539
really don't have a personal because of my 
position. I take the position, well, now let's

29:14.260 --> 29:17.205
forget your position. We want to know what you 
think. I said, I'm totally in favor of it. I said,

29:20.610 --> 29:23.835
this university's got to enter the next century. 
We've got to admit women on a limited basis. We can

29:27.320 --> 29:31.707
no longer be a little college where the Corps of 
Cadets is a student body. And when I said that, I was

29:32.041 --> 29:34.143
just waving. They didn't kill me. They were so mad 
at me. Do you think change has been a more difficult

29:36.526 --> 29:39.849
thing for A&M than most schools? As it turned out, 
no. It was initially. We had about two years of

29:42.872 --> 29:44.414
hell. What two years were those? 69, 70, 71?

29:51.782 --> 29:52.042
No. It was... I'll give you some... Let's see.

30:00.111 --> 30:00.411
Uh... You see, in 63, the Board of Directors 
permitted women to be enrolled on a limited basis.

30:12.879 --> 30:13.880
Those were the tough years. Oh, man, that was 
tough. Because the first time I saw women being

30:15.282 --> 30:20.049
officially admitted in the catalog was 71. In the 
catalog. But see, meanwhile, they were coming and

30:22.133 --> 30:27.000
slipping and so on and so on. And it was really... 
Nothing was said, they were just admitted. They

30:31.137 --> 30:32.339
applied, they were admitted. That's what I, in the 
last, especially the couple of years. Yeah, I'm

30:35.043 --> 30:36.045
trying to think. Rudder's administration.

30:41.734 --> 30:46.061
Yeah, 67, this one's about to come up here. I don't 
think we even listed it as a thing, except this,

30:46.622 --> 30:51.229
limited basis. I think it's, I don't think, You 
know, another thing people have asked me over and

30:57.766 --> 31:03.572
over, when black students first were admitted to 
A&M? And I tell them, I don't know. 67. Happily, I

31:05.534 --> 31:06.435
don't know. Is that right? Joe Busser guided the 
first one through, took him personally. I've

31:10.580 --> 31:12.542
never heard that before.

31:18.569 --> 31:18.709
Uh-huh. Yeah. And after that, women came in, 
unlimited, unlimited, 67.

31:26.958 --> 31:27.098
Uh-huh. Because I was so close to, because I was 
between Curley and Heaton, see? And old Heaton

31:37.690 --> 31:42.255
called me and said, Bucket, call me Bucket, 
Bucket. This is Lloyd. I always called him Homer

31:44.057 --> 31:45.539
Lloyd. I said yes, Homer Lloyd, what can I do for 
you? Seven o'clock in the morning. Bucket, Austin

31:48.802 --> 31:52.646
quit. I said oh, oh Lloyd, I'm sorry to hear that. I 
said you know Earl Rudder's really He said, I know

31:58.769 --> 32:01.993
Bucket, but he quit. You know, Austin never got 
along with me. And I said, well yeah, what can I do

32:06.299 --> 32:11.205
for you? He said, well what am I going to do, Bucket? 
He says, I can't advertise this thing. I said, you

32:16.011 --> 32:19.596
got anybody? I said, sure. He said, who is it? I 
said, it's my next door neighbor.

32:26.900 --> 32:33.550
I said, well one side of me is Charles Landweber, 
and on the other side of me is Ed Cooper. He said,

32:34.872 --> 32:35.933
what's Ed doing? I said, well you know, they kicked 
him around in that counseling business he really

32:36.053 --> 32:41.000
didn't like. And he's now in the oil business and 
he's driving an altar. He's got the, what's the

32:45.106 --> 32:56.603
name of that guy's name, the man who had the 
distributorship for Amoco here, they have

32:45.106 --> 32:56.603
another word for it, you have a consignment. And I 
said, he now has Brenham and Caldwell and Bryan. He

33:00.622 --> 33:06.270
has this whole district here that he's driving an 
oil truck around distributing gasoline and so on.

33:06.290 --> 33:09.555
I said, I think he's doing OK as far as money is 
concerned. But I said, he hasn't got to do that.

33:11.498 --> 33:12.199
He's got talents. This university needs him. 
Because the registrar is a critical thinker. We

33:15.904 --> 33:17.266
had to go big time. So he said, well, can you have him 
in my office at 9 o'clock? I said, he'll be there. So

33:25.388 --> 33:27.109
I called Ed Cooper next door. This is about 7.10 by 
now. I said, meet me in the backyard. I didn't want

33:32.074 --> 33:35.957
to talk around his kids or Peggy or anybody or my 
place. He said, meet me in the backyard. I said,

33:37.078 --> 33:39.940
Homer Lyon called. He lost and quit. So a runner 
will want a recommendation for a replacement.

33:50.269 --> 33:53.012
And I said, I'm not asking you if you're going to do 
it. I'm telling you, you're going to do it. And so

33:55.122 --> 34:02.493
put a suit on, put a tie on, and be over at Lloyd's 
office at 9 o'clock. And I said, and say yes. You got

34:04.076 --> 34:05.859
all that, Cooper? God damn, Warwick. I said, I'm 
class 42 and you're 50. I got 10 years on you. I said,

34:11.928 --> 34:13.230
do what I say now. I said, you're not a damn oil man, 
you're a people man. And you're made for people.

34:20.301 --> 34:21.062
So... He went over there and Homer Lloyd just 
assumed he was going to, I don't think Cooper ever

34:21.430 --> 34:27.358
said yes, I'm taking it. Everybody told him what he 
was going to do. It took him about two weeks to,

34:29.722 --> 34:35.570
Kelly, Broach. Yeah, Broach, sure, Broach and 
Brinkman. Yeah, sure, okay. And it took him about

34:38.994 --> 34:40.316
that long. He told Broach that he'd just been 
offered this opportunity with the university and

34:40.356 --> 34:46.525
he was going to take it. And so Rudder dies and here 
comes Williams. William said, who knows

34:51.772 --> 34:55.236
everything about this campus? I said, Ed Cooper. 
He said, well, can I get him? I said, well, he's

34:59.021 --> 35:02.165
being groomed right now for registrar. And 
William says, hell, I can get registrars from

35:02.585 --> 35:07.171
anywhere. I can hire a registrar every day, but I 
can't hire anybody that knows everything that's

35:07.191 --> 35:12.177
going on, all the people and all about it. I need to 
know inside. I need to know everyone. I said, well,

35:15.601 --> 35:21.508
Ed was in this job up here before, former runner. 
got rid of McCrory, he brought Cooper back from

35:21.910 --> 35:25.714
extension service and put him in. And I said, he's 
the best man for this job, because he's

35:26.655 --> 35:50.702
diplomatic, he doesn't have any biases anywhere, 
he'll tell you the truth, like I will, I'll tell you

35:26.655 --> 35:50.702
the truth, about people and things, and so as best I 
see it, because I try to look at all facets of a

35:26.655 --> 35:50.702
person, and I find more good than bad in them, but 
when they're bad, anyway, so he said, well, I want

35:26.655 --> 35:50.702
him. He said, I won't keep you very long. I want him 
for six months or something like that. I said,

35:55.063 --> 35:56.525
well, he's used to being used. But I said, give him a 
little boost in salary. And I helped him a little

35:58.628 --> 35:59.850
bit. He's got a big family. He likes to screw a lot. 
And I said, he's bred a lot of kids over there, four

36:02.293 --> 36:07.621
or five of them. So Ed went up there with him a while 
and helped him. And of course, Williams was smart.

36:13.610 --> 36:14.591
He kept the whole staff. He kept Elder Rowell. He 
had two staffs up there, the system and the

36:16.154 --> 36:18.898
university. And that's what happened. Drugs 
Miller took over. He didn't have any staff, but

36:22.448 --> 36:24.593
they knew anything. That's where I really got in 
trouble with him. He'd pull this book and all kinds

36:27.360 --> 36:30.007
of shit like that. Well, it was a disaster in the 
days of A&M. It wasn't anybody knows. Yeah, I bet

36:35.180 --> 36:37.767
so.

36:39.248 --> 36:43.473
which is tragic because the guy had been around 
long enough that he should have known. Oh, he

36:43.493 --> 36:46.117
should have taken Nelda. He should have got on his 
knees and said, let me have Nelda, let me have

36:46.137 --> 36:50.662
somebody that's been through this. And he should 
not, but when Nelda did one work, plus he bought his

36:51.463 --> 36:57.030
whole experiment station staff up there. Yeah, 
but you know, I still see signs of that. I'll tell

37:00.034 --> 37:05.260
you something a little while ago that I ran across, 
the same kind of mentality. It's incredible.

37:08.765 --> 37:08.985
Anyway. OK, about the time you're leaving now, the 
80s. Oh, I didn't find that. That's OK. It's in

37:18.611 --> 37:19.491
here. I'll find it. It's in here. It's under the 
annual fund drive. Now, let's see. Here we go. OK,

37:25.076 --> 37:27.738
now here it is. Texas A&M Foreign Students Annual 
Giving. In 1942, we had 6,000 contributions. 43,

37:33.543 --> 37:35.445
that's when the annual fund started. It was called 
the Development Fund of the Association of

37:35.946 --> 37:38.888
Foreign Students. I changed it to the annual fund 
when we tried to get that development foundation

37:39.138 --> 37:45.232
going. A lot of people give me credit for getting 
these foundations going. I got them to get them off

37:49.602 --> 37:50.865
my back. I was doing their damn work. And I knew that 
we should have this structure. And a lot of people

37:54.697 --> 37:57.982
said, well, you've got everything to compete with 
you. I said, because that's not the role of an

37:58.102 --> 38:01.548
alumni association. It's the role of a 
university. It's the role of the athletic

38:03.070 --> 38:06.877
department for the 12th Man Foundation. And we 
finally got everything named right. So the alumni

38:08.880 --> 38:12.466
association, its business is not to manage money. 
Its business is to raise money. Well, to raise

38:14.048 --> 38:18.375
money annually from former students, annual 
giving. And what else? Long-term endowment

38:19.955 --> 38:24.522
giving and wills and bequests, that's the job of 
the foundation. And what else would you say is the

38:24.762 --> 38:28.347
role of the former students? To nurture the former 
students, to set up the railroad track down which

38:28.367 --> 38:33.876
development go to get the big bucks. See, it's our 
job to provide a communications vehicle, which is

38:34.637 --> 38:42.068
the Texas Aggie Magazine. annual council 
meetings because we've got a wonderful

38:42.487 --> 38:47.518
organization of councilmen and board directors. 
Which in turn is to nurture the university.

38:49.302 --> 38:49.864
Absolutely. The whole thing is to make former 
students feel good. That's why we want the

38:52.269 --> 39:01.069
president to come to reunions and the football 
coach to come to the council meetings to make them

38:52.269 --> 39:01.069
feel good, to make them feel like they're 
important and somebody and so on. And mainly we

39:01.606 --> 39:05.752
want to perpetuate the devotion they developed 
during their college days. Which you have an

39:06.452 --> 39:09.056
exceptional success. Okay, I came in 1961. Let's 
see, 1960 we had 9,000 contributors for $178,000.

39:22.334 --> 39:25.057
My first year here, 61, we jumped to 13,000. That 
was city campaign, see? 61 was 13,094

39:27.560 --> 39:31.005
contributors. for $304,000. Then

39:32.921 --> 39:46.678
in 1962, we had 17,468

39:32.921 --> 39:46.678
contributors for $283,000. We dropped down a 
little there. And in 1963, we dropped down again

39:52.604 --> 39:58.191
14,744 contributors And let's see, I'm going to 
have to get a better thing here.

40:06.307 --> 40:07.388
We're back up to $316,000. 63, 14,744, 316,000.

40:13.434 --> 40:17.959
64, 14,000 contributors for 267,000. And just 
let's go down here to 71. We had, oh, 1969 was our

40:21.722 --> 40:28.549
first million dollar year. In 1969, we had 17,932 
contributors for $1,073,071.27. That

40:37.678 --> 40:47.591
was our first million-dollar year, and it's over 
$4 million now, I think. That's annual giving. In

40:51.015 --> 40:53.358
1971, we had another million. From then on, it was 
made. I don't know whether this goes through. Oh,

40:56.381 --> 40:57.142
no, here it is. This goes through 1977. About 1976, 
we broke $2 million. 1976, we went to 27,000

41:05.521 --> 41:09.106
contributors, 27,352. Now, that was only about, 
you know, that was only about, let's see, how many

41:09.166 --> 41:15.556
folks do we have? When I came here, we had about 40, 
we had 30,000. When I left, we had 100,000. And then

41:23.542 --> 41:24.743
now there's 200,000. This commencement will put 
200,000. Yeah, I remember all those numbers.

41:29.609 --> 41:35.295
27,352 contributors in 76 for $2,427,830.

41:35.555 --> 41:37.437
Say that again now. 2,000,000. I'll give you the 
numbers. 2,427,830.

41:45.826 --> 41:52.013
That

41:45.826 --> 41:52.013
was in 76. this commencement will will mark the 200 
000 right i'm glad you mentioned that good that was

41:52.347 --> 42:15.722
a good number you bet 1977 we had two million well 
two million two hundred forty eight thousand with

41:52.347 --> 42:15.722
twenty thousand contributors we dropped down see 
from you and you're giving you'll drop down

41:52.347 --> 42:15.722
depending on events when we publish the directory 
it goes up see people want that book yeah And if you

42:16.006 --> 42:20.231
make a contribution of more than $38, whatever it 
is. Now, here's the Development Foundation. See,

42:22.454 --> 42:26.779
in 53, it was founded for $2,210. And in 1977,

42:26.919 --> 42:39.414
it

42:26.919 --> 42:39.414
had a total of $12,254,055. 1977.

42:45.048 --> 42:48.893
That's where we transferred that PES money over 
there. Speaking of money, what about the former

42:48.913 --> 42:54.800
students' involvement with the legislature and 
the appropriations process? Yeah, we do

42:55.521 --> 42:56.562
lobbying. Did you do a lot of it personally? Yes. I 
had a network set up of Aggies and contacts that

43:01.809 --> 43:08.217
they could make. And I had centers in El Paso and 
cities like Midland, Odessa, and Lubbock. And of

43:14.900 --> 43:27.096
course, the Dallas-Fort Worth, the big one where 
you had most of them, Houston, we had chairman,

43:14.900 --> 43:27.096
mainly the president let us know where the 
weaknesses were and we'd kind of be able to contact

43:14.900 --> 43:27.096
our representative. What they did was up to them. 
Because we couldn't spend any annual fund money.

43:32.564 --> 43:33.986
See, I had to fight people all the time. They wanted 
us to put a lobbyist on a payroll. I said, oh, shit,

43:35.988 --> 43:37.550
no, don't do that. I said, if you do that with the 
foundation or with the association, We're going

43:41.292 --> 43:43.335
to lose our tax exempt status. Hell, someone can 
file on us. I said, we can't do that. We can't use any

43:47.560 --> 43:52.846
of that money other than the purpose for which it's 
stated in our charter. Could have gotten you in

43:54.428 --> 43:55.690
trouble quick. You know what I used to get in 
trouble with all the time? I had a guy in Beaumont

43:58.533 --> 43:59.715
call me. He was giving money under the table to 
athletes. And he called me and says, say, you got

44:02.818 --> 44:08.325
any of those receipts last year kicking around 
there? I said, no, Eber. We don't have receipts for

44:10.435 --> 44:15.920
annual giving or any giving laying around or 
kicking around someplace. Like I said, they're

44:15.980 --> 44:19.664
very closely monitored, and the IRS checks them 
out. I said, we have to report by number every

44:19.804 --> 44:23.768
receipt. And he said, well, you can write me a 
letter thanking me for getting it. I said, no, I

44:27.351 --> 44:29.513
can't do it, not unless it's received. I said, I'd 
lose my job. I'd go to jail. I said, you're asking me

44:33.317 --> 44:35.058
to violate the law. Well, hell, I can't get any tax 
relief. I said, Eber, I'm sorry, I can't. He tried

44:43.157 --> 44:44.738
to get Olive to do it. He tried to get other people to 
do it. And then he finally came and they said, no,

44:46.280 --> 44:49.023
no, no, we can't do that. You have to talk to Buck.

44:53.188 --> 44:53.888
Sorry, I said. This is just another example of the 
kind of pressure. I'm sure he wasn't the only one.

44:57.572 --> 44:59.154
If they didn't ask, at least they thought about it. 
Oh, no, they asked. Now, why did you decide to

45:02.178 --> 45:07.223
retire? Well, for two reasons. One, I had a big 
surgery. I had an aortal aneurysm in 1978. And I

45:16.388 --> 45:18.250
felt good. I was doing all right. I was swimming. I 
was really watching my health. And what I was

45:23.257 --> 45:25.640
trying to do is not have a heart attack. My heart was 
pretty good. But I had these bones. DeBakey put me

45:29.185 --> 45:31.428
in a Dacron aorta. And I knew then the committees 
were working on this. Alumni Center. And I was at a

45:41.453 --> 45:52.827
point where I really had to make some decisions, 
big decisions about what I wanted to do the rest of

45:41.453 --> 45:52.827
my life, because I was kind of worried. Hell, 
Rudder had died, Williams had died, everybody all

45:53.167 --> 46:01.417
around me had died, and I knew that I wasn't in the, I 
knew that I had enough stress. I just, so, and the,

46:06.907 --> 46:24.792
We were in Denver, no, in Colorado Springs, and 
Dick Hash and Ed Davis took my message to the board

46:06.907 --> 46:24.792
and said, if you'll continue on salary, $865,000, 
or at least a reasonable salary. Because I knew I

46:25.473 --> 46:26.775
could make some. I taught industrial 
communications over in the engineering

46:27.396 --> 46:32.683
technology department. ET-401, I think it was. 
But I was just getting like a graduate student

46:36.202 --> 46:42.930
about $600 a month, which is all right. I really 
didn't need it. I had three classes a week. So that

46:50.259 --> 46:51.601
was fair enough. But I had so many requests for 
consulting. So I probably had about 20 or more that

46:54.725 --> 47:03.576
I had to say, I'll call you back, or I'll let you know 
when. I started doing that. Well, then I've gone

47:04.948 --> 47:08.361
for my wife again, and she's getting worse and 
worse. She was in a bad depression, and I was

47:08.903 --> 47:13.380
running back and forth to Houston.
