00:02.393 --> 00:16.215
What were the opinions or maybe even their 
evaluation of veterinary medicine of the

00:02.393 --> 00:16.215
previous presidents and provosts before I went to 
the president's office? Starting with, I think,

00:18.799 --> 00:29.616
the team of Dr. Vandiver, who was present when I 
came back here, and in the provost's office, with

00:30.389 --> 00:57.932
Chuck McCandless and Gordon Eaton, there was a 
real support of veterinary medicine, because I

00:30.389 --> 00:57.932
think that they had been in the position long 
enough to realize that this was the only

00:30.389 --> 00:57.932
veterinary medical program in the state of Texas, 
and that it was one of the top in the nation, and if it

00:30.389 --> 00:57.932
were to remain top in the nation, that it was going 
to require considerable attention. It had to have

01:03.451 --> 01:04.912
increased funding. It had to have some new 
facilities. And one of the greatest chores I had

01:07.575 --> 01:16.245
when I was still back in the veterinary medical 
school was to get the new large animal teaching

01:07.575 --> 01:16.245
hospital and the new research building. And the 
college could not have been a top university

01:17.447 --> 01:23.734
without those and was going to be on probation. Who 
deserves most credit for bringing that into

01:25.946 --> 01:30.212
reality? Well,

01:32.015 --> 01:53.367
I, you know, you don't want to say I did something, 
but George Shelton and I went to the mat on those

01:32.015 --> 01:53.367
facilities, and we finally convinced the 
university, we finally convinced Ed Peel, who was

01:53.701 --> 02:12.726
Vice Chancellor for Facilities and Planning and 
we convinced Mr. Weisenbaker and the other

01:53.701 --> 02:12.726
members of the Board of Regents and actually took 
them to see the facilities and how antiquated and

01:53.701 --> 02:12.726
old they were and that it was absolutely essential 
that we have them. Who were the, on the Board of

02:12.746 --> 02:20.957
Regents, who started out being the strongest 
proponents?

02:22.726 --> 02:29.372
I don't know that we really got into that until we 
had convinced the building committee and Mr.

02:22.726 --> 02:29.372
Weisenbaker. And once we had done that, it was a 
pretty easy sale. We had to also convince Dr.

02:35.438 --> 02:39.882
Atkinson, who was chancellor. And he saw the need. 
And of course, being a premier scientist, he

02:42.585 --> 02:51.433
clearly knew that the research component was so 
critical to us. and he became one of our staunch

02:51.717 --> 02:59.835
supporters and I think really helped gain the 
support of the Board of Regents. All right, then

03:00.997 --> 03:08.494
after

03:00.997 --> 03:08.494
President Vandenberg, who's next? Bill Mobley 
followed him. Oh, okay. And before you went over to

03:13.903 --> 03:22.355
work with him, what did you think his level of 
concern for veterinary medicine was? Well, Bill

03:22.916 --> 03:27.382
probably did not know much about veterinary 
medicine. But having sat on the dean's council and

03:27.402 --> 03:37.536
having been given a background, at least from the

03:39.372 --> 03:46.723
I guess, communication process and interchange 
that would occur there, had a great appreciation

03:39.372 --> 03:46.723
for what that program meant. I think not only to 
Texas A&M University, but to the system and to the

03:47.444 --> 03:52.632
state. And he became a very strong supporter. And 
of course, with my background, he would rely upon

03:58.320 --> 04:06.713
me, but we were both very careful to never do 
anything that would signify that we might be given

04:08.043 --> 04:12.851
preference to veterinary medicine because we 
weren't. It was just one of the strong programs

04:13.192 --> 04:22.168
that had to continue its advancement and had to 
have the kind of funding required to do that. And it

04:23.170 --> 04:31.384
was looked at as a program that would not be a drain 
but a complement to A&M, and particularly since it

04:23.170 --> 04:31.384
had now become line item. And then he was able to be a 
great spokesperson for the program. Who in Austin

04:35.490 --> 04:41.539
were the greatest help in that line item status? 
Bob Bullock was a real help in that. The

04:46.967 --> 04:51.533
coordinating board was, and Ken Ashworth really 
did help us a lot. Jimmy Bond was vice chancellor

04:52.087 --> 04:56.615
and handled a lot of the state affairs. He really 
did help. And just many of the legislators like

04:58.959 --> 05:05.670
Rick Perry, for instance, was one that really did 
help us. And most of, even Senate Finance

05:11.341 --> 05:15.067
Committee, the House Appropriations Committee. 
Once they had the endorsement of the University

05:16.449 --> 05:24.641
and the Chancellor, they had the endorsement of 
the Coordinating Board and the Legislative

05:16.449 --> 05:24.641
Budget Board. We probably had to work hardest in 
convincing the Legislative Budget Board than

05:25.543 --> 05:30.671
any. But once they did and they saw the parallel to 
the medical and dental schools, then they became

05:31.512 --> 05:38.783
very supportive. All right, and you're in this 
notch as the assistant to the president, chief of

05:38.932 --> 05:46.725
staff, and executive for how long? I was only in 
that role for one year. And Gordon Eaton and Chuck

05:50.351 --> 05:54.458
McAnus leave to go to Iowa State. And Don 
McDonnell, his title was vice president.

06:02.118 --> 06:05.642
Academic, Vice President for Academic Affairs 
and Provost. Okay, and then what was your title? Or

06:10.007 --> 06:11.469
was it the same under him? No, mine changed. Mine 
was given the title of Senior Vice President and

06:12.670 --> 06:16.435
Provost. And that was purposely done to signify 
that it was the second administrative officer of

06:17.496 --> 06:24.804
the university. We were already laying the 
groundwork for the endowment campaign. That was

06:34.841 --> 07:00.913
the vision that Bill had knowing that long term 
that we had to rely probably less on the available

06:34.841 --> 07:00.913
university fund and what the state appropriation 
was and begin to look at what other universities

06:34.841 --> 07:00.913
had to do many, many years earlier and that was to 
have a great increase in our overall endowment. So

07:01.433 --> 07:22.381
knowing that he was going to be out a lot with that 
campaign and dealing with an external

07:01.433 --> 07:22.381
constituency and the alumni, the former 
students, and then also to devote a lot of his time

07:01.433 --> 07:22.381
to the legislative side of the university to 
increase and help our state funding. Because we

07:22.401 --> 07:31.373
were at a time where, quite honestly, state 
funding was not increasing at the same as it had

07:22.401 --> 07:31.373
been in the past. So with all of those in mind and 
knowing that a lot of the heart of the university is

07:31.910 --> 07:51.944
the academic area anyway, he changed the title to 
Senior Vice President and Provost so that when he

07:31.910 --> 07:51.944
was gone, the shoulders, the responsibilities of 
the presidency would be in my lap that day or those

07:31.910 --> 07:51.944
days. Right. So you were a staff member. officer 
for him, the deans did not report directly to you?

08:00.816 --> 08:00.976
Yes. Oh, they did? Yes. All the deans reported to 
me, all the libraries, student admissions, all

08:02.338 --> 08:13.393
the vice presidents, the research program, the 
faculty. What about your, on a diagram chart, what

08:13.914 --> 08:19.922
was your relationship to Donald McDonald then? 
Oh, I replaced him. Oh, you replaced Donald.

08:23.347 --> 08:27.653
Donald left and went to American University in 
Egypt. In Egypt, okay. And then I went through the

08:28.794 --> 08:36.604
whole selection process and was his, I succeeded 
him. All right, I'm confused then. Eaton?

08:40.388 --> 08:41.552
McDonald followed. All right. And Eaton is there 
for about a year after you for your first year? No.

08:47.796 --> 08:47.936
No. McDonald had been named provost a year or two 
before I became executive assistant and chief of

08:51.948 --> 08:57.556
staff. Oh, I see. Okay. Describe the working, the 
leadership style of Bill Mobley and his greatest

09:01.020 --> 09:13.518
joys and his greatest pet peeves or frustrations. 
Well, it was interesting because he was one of the

09:13.538 --> 09:21.769
premier administrators that I have ever worked 
with. I would characterize Bill as a visionary

09:22.070 --> 09:33.260
leader who tried to select competent people and 
delegated to them and held them accountable. He

09:35.302 --> 09:38.505
had a real vision for A&M. He had an incredible 
loyalty. He was also a people person who really

09:42.309 --> 09:48.415
cared about the people that he led. His greatest 
joys had to come from the success of the endowment

09:53.002 --> 10:05.395
campaign, the success that we had in elevating all 
of the academic and research programs at this

09:53.002 --> 10:05.395
university. The greatest heart burns that he and I 
both shared would have been having to handle the

10:07.297 --> 10:22.873
athletic problems and we both went through the 
times where The university was under intense

10:23.748 --> 10:42.774
scrutiny from investigative reporters and 
newspapers and all kinds of questions about a lot

10:23.748 --> 10:42.774
of the business processes and things that were 
happening even in the border regions. So those

10:43.275 --> 10:45.778
were the more difficult sides of it. But the great 
accomplishments in times of real fruit-bearing

10:52.081 --> 10:55.906
related to really the heart of the university, and 
that would be the academic side. In terms of

10:56.787 --> 11:06.719
personal things, what were his, did he have any pet 
peeves, special kind of coffee? Well, it was

11:06.799 --> 11:10.744
interesting because, yeah, he did. One thing that 
I, I was always afraid to ride with Bill because he,

11:10.784 --> 11:19.455
the first several years he smoked a pipe, And he 
would be trying to smoke his pipe and light it, talk

11:19.705 --> 11:25.536
on the phone and drive all at the same time in 
Houston. And I would sit there with pushing my foot

11:25.556 --> 11:30.125
in the floor many times, worried about him. And 
Bill was one of those people, too, who really got

11:31.046 --> 11:38.801
hyper-focused when there was an issue or when 
there was an opportunity. And I never will forget

11:39.382 --> 11:41.967
coming back from Houston one day. We had been to 
Austin and back the day before, and we'd gone to

11:42.605 --> 11:52.780
Houston, and we get right outside South College 
Station, and we stop at this red light, and his car

11:42.605 --> 11:52.780
runs out of gas. And I just envisioned, here we are, 
the president and senior vice president and

11:53.341 --> 12:05.760
provost of Texas A&M University pushing his car to 
a fill-in station, which was fortunately only

11:53.341 --> 12:05.760
about 100 yards up the road. And for some reason, he 
tried to crank it one time. It started, he gave it a

12:10.144 --> 12:17.714
big push, and he gave it enough gas that we rolled in 
dead, dead engine, into the gas station. Oh, no,

12:18.535 --> 12:19.536
that's a good one. That's a good one. All right, 
what about his pet, Joey? Is that something he

12:22.280 --> 12:24.002
really enjoyed? Bill really enjoyed the 
interaction with students. He had a real heart for

12:29.329 --> 12:34.195
students, and he really enjoyed the times that he 
had with them. We had a lot of events for students at

12:34.951 --> 12:43.504
the house, the president's home, at the MSC. Bill 
loved to make speeches, and I think those were real

12:45.206 --> 12:50.074
times of joy. Did anybody prepare them for him? A 
lot of times Mary Helen Bowers would prepare. Bill

12:57.209 --> 13:23.166
was notorious about deviating from the text in 
fact he usually got up and would make the statement

12:57.209 --> 13:23.166
to the crowd that my wife says I make two mistakes 
with all my speeches one is I deviate from my text

12:57.209 --> 13:23.166
and the second is I return to my text he was 
notorious about doing that but he always had a

12:57.209 --> 13:23.166
message and he always had a speech that reflected 
the good of what Texas A&M was about. Were the

13:29.539 --> 13:33.482
speeches normally written out in full or just an 
outline of topics? Most of his were written out in

13:33.542 --> 13:40.308
full, but he frequently would just put the notes in 
his pocket and go extemporaneously. Who would he

13:41.389 --> 13:49.296
turn to most often for input, suggestions, 
opinions? The Vice Presidents. We had the

13:51.258 --> 13:53.760
President's Council meeting every Monday. And he 
would turn to all of us in those situations. If it

13:59.606 --> 14:02.829
were an academic matter, clearly he would call me. 
If it were a student matter, he clearly would call

14:03.630 --> 14:08.414
John Colas, who was vice president for student 
affairs. If it was a matter of operations and

14:09.676 --> 14:14.660
administration, it was Robert Smith at that time. 
So he was a very trusting individual and a very

14:16.582 --> 14:23.629
delegating individual. And Bill was a person who 
rarely praised in private, but he had a great

14:24.183 --> 14:41.080
ability to praise the people around him who were 
giving contributions to the overall good of the

14:24.183 --> 14:41.080
university in public. You never knew when it was 
going to come. For example? He would do it. For

14:45.505 --> 14:48.368
example? If it perhaps would be a group of former 
students or a group in one of the college's

14:48.702 --> 15:06.682
development council and I was there and we'd done 
something in the academic side that was going to

14:48.702 --> 15:06.682
make a difference, he would just give credit 
maybe. And he was good at remembering to do that. Of

15:09.465 --> 15:16.853
the groups that he spoke to, which ones do you think 
he enjoyed speaking with most and least?

15:19.837 --> 15:29.810
Probably he enjoyed speaking to former students 
groups the most, as well as one other. Bill had this

15:31.131 --> 15:40.964
vision also of the international dimension 
coming into Annan University. And he should be

15:40.984 --> 15:43.347
given credit. for infusing that dimension into 
every segment of this university. That's a good

15:48.360 --> 15:49.521
point. And he loved to talk to groups about that 
particular topic and what it meant to the future of

15:49.541 --> 15:57.630
this university.

15:59.231 --> 16:04.877
Probably the least

15:59.231 --> 16:04.877
would be the same as mine. Some of the legislative 
budget hearings, those are probably the hardest

16:04.917 --> 16:10.083
and most grilling. Can you give an example of? Oh, 
man, we went through one time in the House

16:14.140 --> 16:19.406
Appropriations. It seems like that the group was 
in a nasty mood most of the time for some reason that

16:19.486 --> 16:26.934
was beyond us. And they had a tough chairman at that 
time. And we followed the University of Houston.

16:36.645 --> 16:43.793
And the University of Houston had had some 
questionable things that had arisen with a letter

16:36.645 --> 16:43.793
that had been sent out regarding even a member of 
the House Appropriations Committee. And we

16:49.019 --> 16:53.843
followed them in giving our budget presentation. 
And they were not in a good mood when we walked in.

16:56.626 --> 16:58.768
And I remember that to this day. We called them when 
we left. We said, that wasn't a hearing, that was an

17:00.429 --> 17:02.651
inquisition. And those were real challenging 
times. During those years, you all were quartered

17:06.454 --> 17:08.757
where? Where were the key demonstrators? I moved a 
lot. when I became chief of staff

17:12.950 --> 17:39.818
then when I became president I moved back to the 
Koch building and then about a few months later or

17:12.950 --> 17:39.818
no more probably than a year then I moved to to the 
administration building on the front of the

17:40.102 --> 17:42.706
campus. And I was able there to bring all of the 
other academic units in with me, with the

17:43.547 --> 17:51.678
exception of research. The Chancellor's full 
operation moved to the headquarters off campus

17:51.698 --> 17:59.308
next to Hilton. And then, of course, when I became 
president later, I moved back to . So I moved a lot.

18:07.102 --> 18:09.505
Let's see.

18:13.229 --> 18:21.779
Describe your vice presidential level 
colleagues at that point under Dr. Mobley. Robert

18:21.940 --> 18:25.163
Smith was vice president for administration and 
operations. Did he predate you? All of them

18:27.506 --> 18:28.808
predated me. John Coldis was vice president for 
student affairs. Bob Walker was vice president

18:33.894 --> 18:36.737
for development. And

18:37.342 --> 18:42.668
which one am I leaving out?

18:45.711 --> 18:46.231
That was it. That's it. We had a very small upper 
administration for the side university. How

18:54.320 --> 18:55.561
often did you all meet? We met every Monday morning 
at 8 o'clock in the president's office. What was

18:59.986 --> 19:01.427
the nature of those meetings? Everything that 
could come up and every issue that was facing us We

19:08.527 --> 19:12.114
had an agenda. We had an agenda. We had an agenda. We 
had an agenda. We had an agenda. We had an agenda. We

19:26.601 --> 19:27.683
had an agenda. Were you encouraged to be candid in 
those sessions? Oh, absolutely. We were

19:31.404 --> 19:38.351
encouraged to be candid and nothing held back and 
share things that needed to be shared. Can you

19:40.193 --> 19:46.621
share any anecdotes of high points, low points, 
happy moments or sad moments? Well, a lot of happy

19:46.641 --> 19:57.653
moments clearly were times where we had made a 
legislative success, where we had been able to

19:46.641 --> 19:57.653
recruit a strategic administrator, a dean, a 
department head, where maybe we'd gotten a

19:58.477 --> 20:17.076
substantial research grant that meant a lot to the 
university, where we had gotten maybe a new

19:58.477 --> 20:17.076
facility that we had proposed to the Board of 
Regents. Just those things that made a big

20:18.778 --> 20:25.665
difference, or we'd gotten a big development 
grant to the university, or somebody made an

20:18.778 --> 20:25.665
enormous gift. Those were the better things that 
happened. The harder things were some of the

20:30.941 --> 20:35.767
things that happened at that time. We had some 
corps issues. There were some incidences of

20:38.970 --> 20:46.278
harassment of women in the corps that had come to 
surface. We had the NCAA issue. And then some of the

20:50.643 --> 20:56.209
other kinds of things that had been developing 
with the Dallas Morning News and investigative

20:56.965 --> 21:06.542
reporting about there was an impropriety or 
something somewhere. You know, just those things

21:07.163 --> 21:16.560
that when an operation is that huge, you want 
everything to go well, to not be questioned. and

21:17.350 --> 21:25.799
that there would be no downers and all positives, 
but that is never going to be the utopia that you

21:17.350 --> 21:25.799
would reach. And Dr. Atkinson was the chancellor 
during that time. Dr. Atkinson was the chancellor

21:29.904 --> 21:35.010
during almost all of that time, yeah. And he was a 
positive factor. He was a very positive factor and

21:36.671 --> 21:40.376
very supportive. It was good because

21:46.831 --> 21:54.019
Dr. Mobley had a great partnership with Dr. 
Atkinson, and I had a great partnership with Dr.

21:46.831 --> 21:54.019
Mobley and Dr. Atkinson. So the three of us were 
able to form a very close team of looking at the

21:55.200 --> 22:13.820
overall academic focus and programs and statue of 
the university with the same kind of goals. So we

22:14.340 --> 22:16.062
were on the same page. And Dr. Atkinson was 
fighting for us in Washington, he was fighting for

22:16.598 --> 22:24.250
us in Austin, and he was very astute at doing it. And 
many times, too, when we would go to the Board of

22:26.113 --> 22:41.458
Regents, for instance, we were all three working 
together on the issues, and there was a

22:26.113 --> 22:41.458
consolidated, unified effort of what we were 
doing. walk through this whole athletic problem?

22:48.441 --> 22:50.244
How did it begin and so forth? Well, there were more 
than one. I got in on the tail end of the Jackie

22:53.448 --> 23:02.839
Sherrill time, and Bill had to take a strong stand 
there. So as Jackie was being terminated, I came

23:03.477 --> 23:07.321
into the president's office. Now what was the 
central issue of the Sherrill problem? Well, that

23:15.249 --> 23:21.875
there were improper payments made to some student 
athletes from Dallas Boosters. I don't know all of

23:23.077 --> 23:27.261
the details because I really did not handle that 
one. Then when I was executive assistant and chief

23:27.281 --> 23:31.425
of staff, And I believe before I had become senior 
vice president and provost, there was a

23:33.143 --> 23:40.276
basketball issue. And Bill had to deal with that 
one. I did not. And then as Bill was leaving the

23:44.123 --> 23:56.164
president's position to become chancellor of the 
system, and I was taking over as president of the

23:44.123 --> 23:56.164
university, it was right in the middle of the last 
NCA issue where eight student athletes had been

23:57.578 --> 24:07.302
paid for working when in fact a lot of times they 
were just sleeping on the job and that had

24:07.872 --> 24:13.179
surfaced. Now these were football? These were all 
football players. And the head coach at that time

24:16.203 --> 24:19.047
was? R.C. was head coach. Oh, okay. And he was upset 
about it as you could imagine because he had made a

24:21.430 --> 24:31.703
pledge and a commitment that this would never 
happen, this would be a clean program. And there

24:32.105 --> 24:35.288
was no institutional involvement whatsoever. It 
was all outside and alumnus involved in it. Do you

24:39.752 --> 24:53.504
feel comfortable in describing your opinion of 
the attitude that Bill Mobley took about these

24:39.752 --> 24:53.504
violations? I would be very honored to express 
what Bill had as an opinion on it because he took

25:01.670 --> 25:30.023
only the highest road of integrity that could be 
taken and quite frankly he and I worked for all

25:01.670 --> 25:30.023
those years together as hard as we could to put in a 
model program that was far and above the NCAA

25:01.670 --> 25:30.023
requirements because we could not afford to have 
any kind of problem arise. And we had the

25:32.642 --> 25:34.664
cooperation of everyone. And I would venture to 
say that even today, a lot of the things that other

25:36.306 --> 25:50.442
universities are now doing are things that are 
modeled after the things that were put in place

25:36.306 --> 25:50.442
through those three times of real trouble. What 
were some of the things y'all put in place? Well,

25:52.104 --> 25:57.711
number one was that the academics would be 
monitored very carefully. There'd be no

25:58.351 --> 25:59.773
questioning those. The student athletes had to 
register what cars they had. They had to then

26:04.813 --> 26:07.798
register where they would be working. They had to 
sign when they signed on a letter of intent at A&M

26:09.580 --> 26:19.035
that if they broke the rules themselves that they 
would lose their scholarships. We had compliance

26:20.337 --> 26:25.204
officers which were new at the time. I mean there 
were so many new things put in place and completely

26:25.741 --> 26:33.216
upheld by the athletic council. And you hate to 
have to do that and to be so rigid and so almost

26:34.498 --> 26:42.133
bureaucratic quite frankly. But we had no option 
because we could not have another issue and we

26:42.413 --> 26:47.884
didn't want anything to happen in our program. We 
had a big education system put into place where we

26:49.477 --> 27:00.370
would actually try to educate the former students 
and anyone of what they could and could not do. So it

27:00.430 --> 27:02.452
was rigid. Am I correct in here having heard the 
report that on one occasion Dr. Mobley as

27:02.473 --> 27:16.690
president

27:02.473 --> 27:16.690
in a real showdown over the Jackie Sherrill matter 
turned in his resignation if they did not, if the

27:17.294 --> 27:23.201
board did not support him. If the board had not 
supported him when he first came into the

27:23.661 --> 27:37.597
presidency, and this was only a few months, in his 
decision for Jackie to be removed because of what

27:23.661 --> 27:37.597
he had done, he would have resigned as president. 
He drew the line in the sand. And that was his

27:40.701 --> 27:46.407
attitude from then forward, that A&M would only 
run a clean program and have the utmost integrity

27:46.741 --> 27:51.028
in it. I'm not going to ask the negative on this one. 
Are there any regents at that time that are notable

27:52.710 --> 28:01.584
for their support of the athletic standards? I 
wasn't in the position at that time. to have seen

28:06.063 --> 28:07.505
and to have known. But clearly they all had to come 
to the forefront of supporting what we put in

28:08.366 --> 28:15.076
place. Was Tom Adair the chairman of the Athletic 
Council? Tom Adair was chairman of the Athletic

28:17.119 --> 28:18.841
Council. What about his role in any of it? He was 
strongly supportive of everything that we did.

28:24.049 --> 28:30.237
And had really over a period of time developed a 
presence on the national scene. So with that

28:30.978 --> 28:35.665
national scene presence he had, you can imagine 
his heart was also to have a model program here. And

28:41.091 --> 28:42.574
that was our goal. Look, A&M is going to have a model 
program. I'm proud to say that Jarvis one day asked

28:45.779 --> 28:50.688
me if they needed another member on the athletic 
council. And I told him that I thought Tom Adair

28:51.570 --> 28:54.956
would be a very good person. And as far as I know, 
he's still the faculty representative. He was

28:58.763 --> 29:01.948
chairman the whole time I was in all the high level 
positions. And I think still is. Yeah. Mobley

29:06.254 --> 29:10.961
moves to the chancellor position. Am I correct in 
remembering that one of the factors that caused

29:12.022 --> 29:23.539
Perry Atkinson to step aside as chancellor was his 
wife's health? I don't know all the reasons, but I

29:24.042 --> 29:27.807
think that clearly that was one of them. His wife 
had what proved to be fatal health problems, and I

29:27.827 --> 29:38.500
knew that he needed and wanted to spend more time 
with her. We hated to see him step out of that role

29:39.442 --> 29:53.239
because he had really been a tremendous leader for 
not only the system, but also we were the

29:39.442 --> 29:53.239
benefactor of what he had done. All right. And then 
Dr. Mobley then becomes the new chancellor, is

29:53.825 --> 29:58.731
that right? He becomes the new chancellor, and 
then I was named interim president. All right.

30:02.495 --> 30:08.822
Describe any of the circumstances you can about 
how that came about, how you learned about it, and

30:02.495 --> 30:08.822
so forth. Well, when Bill was named

30:08.842 --> 30:18.653
chancellor,

30:08.842 --> 30:18.653
I don't even recall But I think he is the one that 
called me and asked if I would serve as interim

30:20.017 --> 30:26.346
president. And then I was probably called by the 
chairman of the board to ask if I'd be willing to

30:26.366 --> 30:34.098
serve in that role. And all of this was happening in 
a rather short period of time. And I immediately

30:41.289 --> 30:47.037
said yes because I had had such a part, I felt, of 
putting in place so many things as Senior Vice

30:47.928 --> 31:10.999
President and Provost in the academic area and the 
research area and the graduate student area that I

30:47.928 --> 31:10.999
wanted, in working with the endowment campaign, 
that I didn't want to see a hiccup or a...
