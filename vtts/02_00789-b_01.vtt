00:01.853 --> 00:15.167
Did you have an opportunity when you were head of 
the department to do any research, or did a member

00:01.853 --> 00:15.167
of your department do any research, or did that 
change over the years? Well, I always felt that we

00:16.409 --> 00:21.755
needed research in the department. Of course, it 
was in the agricultural experiment station that

00:21.775 --> 00:26.039
Dr. Schmetter had charged. He had several men with 
him. In fact, Dr. Turk got started with him. And

00:32.617 --> 00:47.240
we were loaded with teaching hours and with 
responsibilities, more or less extension work of

00:32.617 --> 00:47.240
answering letters. And anything on poisonous 
plants, I got it. And it made me up poisonous plants

00:53.009 --> 00:56.815
from West Texas that I had never seen. And I'd send 
it back to a man who was at Sonora Experimental

01:01.962 --> 01:08.570
Station, a botanist, Mr. Corey, V.L. Corey. And he 
would classify and send back to me, the name back to

01:09.812 --> 01:14.778
me. But I got an enormous number of plants to 
classify. They thought, well, by George, they

01:19.264 --> 01:22.127
just sent a leaf. And I'd write back, and I'd tell 
them I needed a bloom or something like that. But we

01:27.173 --> 01:29.296
did lots of that. I really got into trouble. by 
having taken that course with Dr. Pommel. But I

01:35.980 --> 01:39.103
learned something. I learned appreciation of 
plants with Dr. Pommel. When I'd notice a

01:44.569 --> 01:46.832
livestock, he'd just grunt. No approval or 
disapproval, but he'd see a plant at the same time.

01:53.219 --> 01:55.401
And he says, go over there and get that plant, will 
you? And I'd have to crawl through the wire. and get

01:57.430 --> 02:01.594
that plant and take it over to him, and he'd tell me 
what that plant was. But any time I'd open my mouth

02:03.796 --> 02:08.561
about livestock, he'd see a plant. And so he got me 
botanically minded. I got to appreciating

02:14.106 --> 02:25.497
plants, and I realized to get along with him more 
peacefully, why I would need to look at those

02:14.106 --> 02:25.497
plants. But in general, did you have or did any of 
your staff members in the department have much

02:26.641 --> 02:33.591
time for research? Did that change over the years? 
I guess all of us did a little pilot work of this and

02:38.057 --> 02:42.983
that would get interested. I got interested in 
allergic reactions of animals and

02:43.084 --> 02:52.817
it was all from Physiology or Pharmacology. And I 
remember having presented a paper at the AVMA in

02:53.641 --> 03:00.308
Chicago on allergic reactions in dogs. I happened 
to know Dr. Black, who was in Brown and moved to

03:01.329 --> 03:18.146
Dallas, and he became an allergist up there, and I 
went by to see him when I was up there in 34. And he

03:19.228 --> 03:22.551
encouraged me.

03:23.493 --> 03:28.237
So it was before 34, because I had presented that 
paper in 33. But I got in contact with him, and he

03:29.378 --> 03:33.762
demonstrated. I think we went up there, and Mrs. 
Burns had a brother in Dallas. It was a telephone

03:38.967 --> 03:40.208
company. We went up there, and I went by to see Dr. 
Black. And he demonstrated what a positive

03:43.151 --> 03:47.314
reaction was and what a negative was. So he got me 
started on the allergy testing. get testing some

03:52.703 --> 03:54.225
dogs. But that was research work of a sort. And so 
all of us, I guess, have ever taught in the

03:59.771 --> 04:08.581
department of, perhaps, piddled with things. I 
don't know whether

04:08.621 --> 04:16.690
reports in the literature have been made. I recall 
that one that I made to the national meeting. I know

04:23.416 --> 04:27.281
Eads got interested in research. He was working on 
a degree, though, in

04:29.423 --> 04:42.058
measuring the alveolar air in animals. He had to 
devise a certain instrument to put around the

04:42.318 --> 04:52.090
muzzle of the animal, so he'd have to breathe into 
this. He did a very good piece of work on that. He

04:54.834 --> 05:09.193
reported that in the journal, I think, probably in 
the first volume one, number one of

04:54.834 --> 05:09.193
our research journal. I don't recall the year, 
probably in 38, something like that. Did it appear

05:17.011 --> 05:26.302
in the School of Vet and Medicine that there was 
more emphasis placed on research over the years,

05:17.011 --> 05:26.302
or less, or did that change? No, more, because then 
when research and extension became a part of the

05:26.602 --> 05:41.280
teaching, all in the same department, in colleges 
and schools. schools because they didn't become

05:41.817 --> 05:49.526
colleges until 63, until the name was changed from 
a college to university.

05:52.029 --> 06:10.930
Each

05:52.029 --> 06:10.930
department increased, of course, the amount of 
research work, and when that happened—and that

05:52.029 --> 06:10.930
happened in 48,

05:52.029 --> 06:10.930
when they consolidated But

06:12.007 --> 06:24.625
I remember in the designing of the physiology 
department, the building where it exists now, we

06:12.007 --> 06:24.625
were on the third floor. Dr. Bowden was dean, and he 
says, the president says, I hate to tell you this,

06:26.248 --> 06:40.849
but says, the president says, design this 
building with what you are in

06:26.248 --> 06:40.849
the present status. And I said, I've

06:42.635 --> 06:52.027
been wanting to incorporate some research. He 
says, no, you design it as of right now. I said,

06:56.293 --> 06:57.594
you're not on research? So I designed it for 
teaching. And I remember contacting the

07:02.901 --> 07:07.006
architect. I said, how much space? on wall work and 
microscope space do you allow for students?" He

07:14.896 --> 07:15.496
says, 30 inches. So I prepared for a lab of 32 in each 
of those labs. We could handle 64 students, both of

07:26.048 --> 07:31.053
them. But

07:31.073 --> 07:37.060
then I started Some of these Pakistanis, East 
Pakistanis came in on us, in addition to 64. And

07:42.485 --> 07:47.491
they take 65, 66, and add them. I said, that's not, I 
raised quite a lot of objection to it. And I said, we

07:53.779 --> 07:55.861
prepared for 32. All the departments could absorb 
them. But I was too conservative in that planning.

08:02.129 --> 08:03.390
I should have added some. I might have gotten by 
with it. Maybe the others did. When did foreign

08:07.516 --> 08:11.263
students start coming to the vet school? Oh, I 
don't know whether you'd call a Puerto Rican a

08:13.687 --> 08:17.755
foreign student, but we had one. One member in 
Class of 1936 was from Puerto Rico. That was before

08:22.624 --> 08:23.946
it was a state. And that was the first one I recall.

08:35.815 --> 08:44.206
Not from Mexico, because that was a national, but 
we had students from Mexico and South America in

08:35.815 --> 08:44.206
the ag course. I've always had some Latinos in my 
classes. But in veterinary medicine,

08:50.315 --> 09:04.033
of course when they made that agreement with 
Pakistan, East Pakistan,

09:05.633 --> 09:08.878
microbiology, physiology, and parasitology. We 
had quite a few graduate students, but we found

09:10.360 --> 09:17.270
quite a few of them inferior. They had not taken 
sufficient, they didn't have enough math, didn't

09:17.310 --> 09:23.559
have enough chemistry. And we had a little 
difficulty with them, and one or two of them

09:24.781 --> 09:32.772
failed. Was

09:34.321 --> 09:38.325
this in the 30s?

09:41.308 --> 09:42.329
I'd say in the 40s. In the 40s? After the Second 
World War? Yes. But

09:48.075 --> 10:04.311
I don't know how many Pakistanis there are now, but 
we used to have quite

09:48.075 --> 10:04.311
a few

09:48.075 --> 10:04.311
of them.

10:07.717 --> 10:09.039
Occasionally we'd get one. I got one that was very 
good. He'd gotten two degrees, one from the

10:12.945 --> 10:19.414
University of London, and I'd forgotten where the 
other one was from, Cambridge or somewhere. But

10:19.474 --> 10:28.547
he didn't mind getting his hands dirty. Some of 
them have caste systems, see, and some of that work

10:29.709 --> 10:35.277
that we did was menial to them. And they wanted to 
observe. And they'd go from lab group to lab group,

10:40.220 --> 10:49.313
and just wanted to look over somebody's shoulder.

10:52.578 --> 11:05.837
But we'd give them the materials, and we'd had a 
pretty hard time enforcing

10:52.578 --> 11:05.837
that each student must pitch in and do his work. But 
we finally got pretty good cooperation. But this,

11:09.135 --> 11:23.813
I've

11:09.135 --> 11:23.813
forgotten his, Ahmed, I don't recall now his full 
name. But he had two degrees. He took a master's

11:26.136 --> 11:29.320
with me. And then he got his PhD in biochemistry. So 
he had four foreign degrees and one from his home.

11:41.159 --> 11:42.321
So he had five degrees. But no one has heard 
anything from him. When they cracked down and got

11:47.389 --> 11:54.860
any more intellectuals over there, they tried to 
weed them out and assassinate them. I'm afraid he

11:54.880 --> 11:56.302
lost his life. I don't know. But he certainly was an 
intelligent person. And with degrees, with all

12:01.069 --> 12:03.673
that many degrees. He was the head of a department. 
He went back and headed the department. Oh,

12:08.898 --> 12:19.074
I remember having Shabani as a student. He 
finished in agronomy. His father was finance

12:22.259 --> 12:32.013
minister of Iran, and

12:22.259 --> 12:32.013
his father would send him a $10,000 check. Dean 
Kyle would of Agriculture would give him

12:33.517 --> 12:40.689
permission to go to Washington, some bank up there 
had deposited. And he'd come back, and Dr. Pearson

12:42.352 --> 12:56.174
was head of nutrition, biochemistry and 
nutrition, and he says, you know, if we could keep,

12:42.352 --> 12:56.174
and he was the one that talked me into taking him. 
You see, when he finished in 40, Got a degree in

13:00.179 --> 13:02.462
agronomy in about 44, 45. He couldn't get home. 
Couldn't get to Iran from any direction. And he

13:09.050 --> 13:12.554
stayed over and took a graduate degree. Got him 
from agronomy. He went to biochemistry. And then

13:16.839 --> 13:21.705
after the war, after he finished those, he got his 
master's. He still couldn't get home. So he went up

13:23.447 --> 13:28.813
to Tennessee, up to Kentucky and worked for a 
distillery. And... Schenley Brothers,

13:30.925 --> 13:33.127
Schenley's I think. Schenley and Schenley, I 
guess, whatever it's called. And he was on

13:37.351 --> 13:50.022
nutrition, I think, from the standpoint of 
byproducts of distillation

13:37.351 --> 13:50.022
by the fiber content. But Shabani, the last I heard 
of him was up in the high, in the that are very

14:00.592 --> 14:02.274
responsible. I don't know whether there's a state 
or in the national government, but I don't know now

14:02.294 --> 14:14.909
since you may be dead by now. What about tenure? In 
the form of student address unknown, so that's

14:16.491 --> 14:20.595
suspicious. Yeah, what about tenure 
requirements? Tell me about those. That came back

14:24.139 --> 14:26.762
since I retired. That's... I know— Didn't you have 
any tenure requirements back in the 20s? None

14:32.329 --> 14:37.835
whatsoever when I knew

14:32.329 --> 14:37.835
them though. Really?

14:41.499 --> 14:42.761
They were talking about it. I think I remember 
going and visiting the American Association of

14:42.801 --> 14:52.652
University Professors when that thing came up, 
and some of them, of course, were against it. They

14:52.672 --> 14:57.177
said, we're firing all right, or we are.

14:59.519 --> 15:05.767
They finally got it in, I don't know, perhaps even 
before Mr. Rutter came in. I know it was effective

15:05.787 --> 15:08.069
when he was president. Possibly something 
before, but it is of comparison to the recent

15:09.471 --> 15:14.798
origin. I would say in the 50s or 60s, Mr. Rutter 
came in 60 or 61, I think.

15:27.785 --> 15:40.016
It may have been with Mr. Gilchrist's time, but

15:27.785 --> 15:40.016
I don't know whether it's any different than what 
it was before or not.

15:48.183 --> 15:55.530
Okay, let's talk about admission standards to a 
college or a school of vet medicine. Back in 1916,

15:55.713 --> 16:08.569
you had to have a high school degree, and those 
admission standards increased until 1957 when

15:55.713 --> 16:08.569
you had to have 70 hours of college coursework. Why 
did they continually increase? Mainly because

16:12.554 --> 16:16.159
there was more and more knowledge in every 
subject. You'd say, well, anatomy, they should

16:17.661 --> 16:22.067
have known, but anatomy has even increased. But 
the... Increase in knowledge was astounding in

16:24.839 --> 16:35.449
physiology and pharmacology, more in 
physiology, and toxicology, and microbiology.

16:35.649 --> 16:43.076
Oh, microbiology is much improvement in finding 
the causes of diseases. These students have a

16:43.937 --> 16:49.022
whole lot more to learn now than we used to because 
not too much was known. And that means more hours.

16:54.623 --> 16:58.187
and more help. Do you think the students today that 
are admitted into the vet school are better than

16:58.207 --> 17:05.696
the ones that were admitted? I mean, do you think 
they're better students, that they know more than

17:05.837 --> 17:10.482
the ones that were admitted back in the 1920s? 
Well, they're screened, and they certainly

17:10.582 --> 17:15.108
should know more. High schools are better. And I 
hope they know a whole lot more. I know some of us

17:23.598 --> 17:37.899
back in those days may not have gotten in under the 
present standards, but I think all that I know of

17:23.598 --> 17:37.899
and all of us were teaching and I knew were A's and 
B's. I know I classify myself as an ordinary

17:38.019 --> 17:43.107
student. I've had A's and B's and occasional C, but 
we didn't have We didn't have that drive for those

17:53.568 --> 17:55.850
grade points. We didn't have grade points back in 
there. We had A, B, and C. And

17:58.974 --> 18:19.094
I think there was, in my time at least, it seems that 
our problem was to learn something and not bother

17:58.974 --> 18:19.094
with the grades. I wasn't bothered about grades. 
In fact, when I finished in 23, I had a bunch of extra

18:22.458 --> 18:28.144
hours. I had things that I might want to use. I took 
concrete construction on my own. And I took herd

18:36.594 --> 18:40.899
book study and animal husbandry on my own. And I 
took some Spanish on my own, mainly because I

18:42.160 --> 18:51.250
wanted to take some work Mr. Ingenhuit, he later 
got his Ph.D. and went to Columbia. Last I heard of

18:56.134 --> 18:58.637
him, he was teaching in Columbia University. I 
think he left here and went to Columbia. He was an

19:01.460 --> 19:03.683
outstanding teacher. He came from Comfort, all 
those Germans out there, but he was excellent in

19:03.763 --> 19:11.692
Spanish. And I took some engineering drawing from 
Mr. Geist. who was quite an artist, and I took that

19:20.643 --> 19:24.207
on my own. So now you think that the students are 
just much more grade-oriented, would you say?

19:30.394 --> 19:31.795
They did become grade. I don't know about right 
now. I can't answer for that. But I retired in 67.

19:39.684 --> 19:45.570
But then when they increased admissions, yes, 
they were fighting for grade points. Now another

19:45.905 --> 19:57.317
thing that happened on the admission standards I 
noticed according to your book is that in 1957 you

19:45.905 --> 19:57.317
needed 70 hours but then they started to decrease 
it. You needed 68 hours in 1964 and then in 1975 you

19:57.857 --> 20:04.364
only needed 66 hours. That occurred- Why did they 
do that? I don't recall specifically but I know

20:07.648 --> 20:12.773
that was when price was deemed. And they felt that 
they had

20:13.664 --> 20:25.038
perhaps too much on there and too much 
requirement. And I know there's a change in

20:25.218 --> 20:37.133
attitude of what should be taken as pre-vet 
courses and, for example, the increase in math.

20:37.193 --> 20:38.254
Some of us thought that that math should be added. 
Finally ended up with calculus. And on graduate

20:45.138 --> 21:04.264
students, if I had a student who came in who looked 
superior and I felt would perhaps be headed for

20:45.138 --> 21:04.264
research, I always tried to get them to add math and 
also physical chemistry. In my years, I remember

21:07.630 --> 21:12.175
having taken a course at biophysical chemistry at 
Iowa State. And I used more of that course than I

21:13.116 --> 21:20.323
think perhaps any course I had. There were twelve 
of us in the class. Ten of them were working on their

21:24.187 --> 21:26.189
PhDs. One of them was working on a master's and I was 
trying to learn something. And I really worked on

21:30.574 --> 21:33.537
that course. And I didn't realize I learned as much 
until I got to using some when I got back. And so I

21:41.365 --> 21:56.447
tried to, we had one of these superior East 
Pakistanis, Mia, who got his veterinary, he had a

21:41.365 --> 21:56.447
veterinary degree from Pakistan.

21:59.832 --> 22:01.334
But he was an outstanding student. He was an A 
student. And I said, Mia, he picked me up as an

22:04.600 --> 22:11.707
advisor. We didn't have advisors and counselors, 
but he'd come around for advice, and I took an

22:11.868 --> 22:21.758
interest in him. And I said, get some mathematics. 
He says, all right, and he made an A in calculus, and

22:27.744 --> 22:33.190
he'd come back, and I said, Dr. Jensen talked to him 
about physical chemistry. He said, oh, no. She

22:41.999 --> 22:43.080
said, hopefully so. I've heard too much about 
that. Well, he had heard about that engineering

22:45.604 --> 22:48.688
course, and he was a bugger. It was... Dr. Jensen 
was head of the department at that time, Fred

22:50.651 --> 22:57.400
Jensen. And I knew him, and

22:57.420 --> 23:04.189
I thought that... There was one course in there for 
other than chem engineers and then for majors in

23:05.300 --> 23:13.808
chemistry. I think it was for engineers in 
general. But it

23:21.255 --> 23:29.463
didn't go as deeply as the one that Mia was thinking 
about. And I don't believe Mia took it, but he ended

23:30.364 --> 23:34.007
up Going to California, the man from the 
physiology department at the University of

23:35.911 --> 23:44.905
California, I tried to get him here. He wasn't head 
of the department, but he was teaching. He came in

23:50.554 --> 23:53.438
my office one day, and I'd heard of him. He's dean at 
Florida now. And I said,

23:57.344 --> 24:02.813
you want to? He was talking about how he liked Texas 
and everything, and how he liked the veterinary

24:03.046 --> 24:08.294
college. I said, how much do you like it? I said, 
I've got a job over there. I'd like to have you. But I

24:14.402 --> 24:15.604
knew something about him. And he said, let me think 
about it.

24:25.438 --> 24:27.882
But I had a nice letter from him when he got back. 
They added five research projects put on him. He

24:33.016 --> 24:34.518
got a promotion out of it. And so they got a number of 
federal grants. That is, I know it was a lump grant,

24:46.975 --> 24:57.509
but that is the time when California was getting a 
major part of these federal funds. And they...

25:03.965 --> 25:05.246
We're picking five students. And he said, do you 
have one, two? We have two to recommend

25:10.792 --> 25:13.635
physiology. He said, I want to get one from each 
school. And I said, he says, now, over in clinic

25:18.541 --> 25:28.511
there, I recommended a man. He's in Washington now 
in research. I said, now, what do you want, a cowboy

25:31.403 --> 25:35.730
or do you want a real student? And he says, I said, I 
know the student. I said, all right, but I said,

25:41.058 --> 25:46.746
this, and he's Pakistani. But I said, he took, he 
followed my advice and has taken math, taken

25:48.449 --> 25:59.525
calculus, and I said, he's strong in math. And...

26:03.263 --> 26:11.055
He has a good chemistry background, and

26:03.263 --> 26:11.055
I said, he'll work for you. He says, now, this is 
cattle. And some of them over there knew that I was

26:13.940 --> 26:17.385
recommending him. They said, he's afraid of 
cattle. I said, he's not afraid of cattle. I said,

26:20.250 --> 26:28.743
all those cowboys get over there, and they walk 
right into him, and he's a little hesitant. But I

26:28.763 --> 26:31.127
said, you give him the responsibility, he'll do 
it. So I recommended, he took me on my

26:32.879 --> 26:36.743
recommendation. And I had a nice letter from Mia 
thanking me for the recommendation. We went out

26:42.908 --> 26:52.417
there, and I got a letter from this man, and he said, 
that's the best graduate student we have. And he

26:53.558 --> 26:55.660
says, now, how about this boy Smith? And I said, 
yeah, Smith's all right. Somebody else in the

26:57.762 --> 26:59.003
department. He said, well, I'm going to take two 
from me and him. He said, I wanted to get, he took one

27:02.360 --> 27:09.428
from Washington and took one from, I don't know, 
Michigan or Illinois or some other. But he, they

27:10.229 --> 27:11.811
tried to spread it out. But he said, I'm going to 
take two A&M. But both of them did fine. But he says,

27:14.715 --> 27:16.977
me at the top. He says, at the top of the bunch. And so 
I was quite happy about it. And I later asked him, I

27:21.463 --> 27:26.108
said, was he harvested in this cattle? He says, no. 
He did, he was perfectly at home around those

27:27.390 --> 27:29.953
cattle. And I said, well, some of them criticized 
me because they criticized, they didn't think

27:31.267 --> 27:40.436
Nier would make as good a man as this other one. And 
that's why I asked you whether you wanted a cowboy

27:41.277 --> 27:48.264
or a

27:41.277 --> 27:48.264
student. But he was an exception. He and this other 
one, I was telling him about having five degrees,

27:51.928 --> 27:57.213
you know, got his matches. But those were 
outstanding East Pakistanis. Let's talk about

28:02.013 --> 28:06.939
the overall aim of the vet school. Can you compare 
the overall aim of the vet school in the 1920s

28:07.540 --> 28:15.070
versus when you retired in the 1960s? What is the 
vet school attempting to accomplish, and how did

28:15.771 --> 28:21.378
that change? Well, in the 20s, of course, I was in 
teaching. I was employed as a teacher. and the

28:26.684 --> 28:33.194
research was done by the Dank-Schmitz force. But 
looking back on it, I think that would have been

28:34.275 --> 28:40.284
better if we'd had some combination. But I think 
that's been a marked improvement. Another thing

28:45.532 --> 28:55.307
is

28:45.532 --> 28:55.307
the improved quality of the employees. In fact, 
when I started this history, I had no idea of

28:56.198 --> 29:10.759
putting the degrees on that, but I was astounded at 
how many of them had PhDs and how the quality, how

28:56.198 --> 29:10.759
many of them.

29:14.544 --> 29:18.029
Each department had PhDs in it, except, I think, 
clinic. I don't think they had any. But, in fact,

29:20.132 --> 29:24.298
now the entire department the dean, the assistant 
dean, the two assistant deans, the dean of

29:25.493 --> 29:39.448
instruction, and that is Wally Bay, and the dean of 
research, associate deans, they're associate

29:25.493 --> 29:39.448
deans. They're all PhDs in the dean's office. And 
at one time, there were none. When Price had it,

29:46.635 --> 29:49.738
there were none in there. Except when Meyer came 
in, Meyer was a PhD. as the Associate Dean of

29:55.936 --> 29:59.180
Research. I don't recall the exact year he 
retired. So do you see that as an improvement? Yes,

30:05.949 --> 30:06.530
I do. I think the quality...

30:06.730 --> 30:22.129
And these men are through with their schoolwork, 
and most of them are interested in research. And

30:24.092 --> 30:25.774
that's improved a great deal. So the aim has 
shifted away then toward research and away from

30:25.973 --> 30:32.902
just training practitioners then? Would you say 
that? No, I think that our product is primarily a

30:34.284 --> 30:42.334
practitioner. Still today? Yes, I think so. Yes, 
absolutely. In fact, most of them are doing small

30:46.240 --> 30:48.943
animal practice. I'd like to see more of them in 
large animal practice. But a lot of them go into

30:54.458 --> 30:57.823
general practice to take care of all. See, in small 
communities, they're forced into it, and some of

30:57.843 --> 31:01.629
them by choice. That's why some of them go to small 
communities. But if they want to go in for the

31:05.435 --> 31:12.545
money, so to speak, I'd like to think they're in the 
minority. But if they go into a city, why, they are

31:13.026 --> 31:20.297
small animal practitioners. like Houston and 
Dallas. But some of them, the edges of the cities

31:25.759 --> 31:33.339
are large animal practice. Some of them in the 
cities go out and dairy practice.
