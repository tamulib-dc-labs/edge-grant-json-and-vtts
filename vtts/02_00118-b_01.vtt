WEBVTT

00:03.136 --> 00:07.121
I brought him down here, met with the president and 
everybody else and the Board of Regents. And they

00:07.982 --> 00:11.887
called the Athletic Council in with the Board of 
Regents and interviewed Jackie. And I said,

00:11.907 --> 00:12.888
Jackie, tell me. I said, how would you feel being 
treated the way Tom Wilson was treated in this

00:13.769 --> 00:17.513
process? He said, John, he said, the question is, 
do you want to win or not? I mean, that's the issue

00:27.726 --> 00:30.409
you're looking at. And I said, well, would the 
Board of Regents have the control over this

00:31.638 --> 00:39.788
appointing a football coach like they have you? 
And, of course, I know Chuck Sampson and others

00:39.828 --> 00:43.873
were backing off when I was asking this. But they 
all agreed that we wanted to win. And then I'm

00:50.221 --> 00:52.143
interviewed by CBS right out here. John McDermott 
and I were asked to be interviewed about the

00:52.684 --> 00:56.008
football coach. John said, I think it's an 
unmitigated disaster that a football coach make

00:56.697 --> 01:01.962
that much and professors are barely making it. We 
don't have this and that. I said, and I didn't use my

01:02.883 --> 01:06.667
little bite. I said, well, I don't have 80,000 
people come to one of my seminars, and our board

01:06.807 --> 01:14.555
wants to be number one in whatever we try to do. And I 
got a nice teaching award the other year a while

01:15.035 --> 01:21.962
back, and I'm not making near that much money, but I 
don't draw 80,000 people to my class either. Well,

01:22.415 --> 01:26.542
they didn't use mine, but they used John, and John 
had the nice long hair, you know. Interesting

01:28.846 --> 01:29.507
time. As far as you know, who was the person or 
persons that identified Cheryl? Oh, I think

01:36.598 --> 01:44.271
probably, if you want to look at it, certainly 
McKenzie, Lindsay. in my recollection. You mean

01:48.100 --> 01:48.963
John Lynch? Yeah. Really? Yeah. Speaker of the 
House at the time. Billy Clayton. Billy Clayton.

01:55.339 --> 01:56.843
They were some of the people that identified him 
because he just had a national championship team.

02:00.643 --> 02:05.469
He had the great quarterback that later played for 
Miami Dolphins.

02:08.533 --> 02:10.156
So you were on the athletic council? I was on the 
council. We were really tied into everything

02:10.957 --> 02:12.799
then. How long after he got here did you serve?

02:23.873 --> 02:25.855
You know, through the time that he was dismissed. 
Oh, really? See, we were called over to Bill

02:26.656 --> 02:29.979
Mobley's office, about three of us. And the head of 
the Board of Regents

02:31.120 --> 02:38.087
called Bill while we were in the office. And this is 
how I remember it. He said, we've got some real

02:41.310 --> 02:47.216
questions about where we're going to fire, the 
coach or not. We've got some questions on the board

02:47.236 --> 02:49.098
here. Some want to keep him. And Bill basically 
said, if you don't fire him, you've got to get rid of

02:53.573 --> 02:56.556
me. I'll never forget that. It got kind of tense. 
Tom Adair was there, someone else. We were in

03:01.821 --> 03:14.272
Bill's office because the head of the Board of 
Regents at the time knew we had to do something, but

03:01.821 --> 03:14.272
they didn't want to let him go because they had so 
much pressure from former students. And Bill took

03:14.352 --> 03:22.500
a real strong stand on that, and I respected him for 
it, even though, hey, Sheryl was a great football

03:14.352 --> 03:22.500
coach. Cheryl turned around our phobia about 
orange and white. We now can beat the University of

03:27.661 --> 03:29.383
Texas. Before that, we didn't think we could. Did 
the Athletic Council have any knowledge of

03:32.348 --> 03:41.783
whether or not there were some violations under 
Cheryl? We did. We did. I remember our group. I had a

03:49.700 --> 03:56.846
little subcommittee with some of the best faculty 
on campus, and we said, don't play a young man named

03:49.700 --> 03:56.846
Flowers from Bryan. Arkansas beat us 28 to nothing 
up in the hills. Next thing I know, Flowers is

04:00.049 --> 04:01.610
playing.

04:04.533 --> 04:12.359
Then we had a little meeting with the associate 
dean of agriculture, education, and others,

04:04.533 --> 04:12.359
where a lot of the players were, worrying about 
eligibility. And I'll never forget this. The

04:15.822 --> 04:18.805
great associate dean of agriculture, been there 
for years. Potts. It was his associate,

04:19.653 --> 04:22.776
gray-headed guy. I think he's out of that role now. 
Not R.C. Potts? No, Potts was the dean. You know who

04:28.903 --> 04:29.784
I'm talking about. Tremendous with students. 
Curtis Lard? No. Not Murray Milford? Not Murray.

04:37.652 --> 04:39.034
He was there for a long, long time. Well, he and 
Brian Cole and another associate dean sitting

04:39.274 --> 04:48.664
around the table with me chairing that committee, 
and Cheryl says, Let me tell you something. I can

04:50.727 --> 04:53.470
interview a young man and tell you whether he's 
going to make it or not. I don't have to worry about

04:54.711 --> 04:57.254
some of these test scores and other things. When 
I'm recruiting a kid, I know who can make it or not.

05:00.858 --> 05:02.219
And I'm not sure you guys can. And I said, Coach 
Sherrill, you're looking at two people right here

05:03.080 --> 05:08.306
who have saved more kids than Jesus Christ. They do 
know kids. And I said, that's not the way to

05:11.049 --> 05:12.670
approach it. And then we knew Flowers was playing. 
Then we knew the Smith thing came out of Georgia.

05:18.395 --> 05:19.256
And then he was gone. Yeah, he violated. Because 
Bill Mobley handled it rather courageously,

05:22.582 --> 05:24.966
didn't he? He did, very courageously. Very much 
so, because I'm not kidding you. The head of the

05:28.972 --> 05:30.555
Board of Regents says, we want to keep him. He says, 
you keep him, I'm gone. That's the impression I

05:34.021 --> 05:35.603
had. Well, that's what we heard that day in that 
office. And this was on a weekend. It was on a

05:42.089 --> 05:43.090
Friday. That's what I thought. It was on a Friday. 
And, you know, my memory's pretty good on that one

05:46.553 --> 05:51.938
in terms of. Who else deserves athletic counsel 
during that era? Who else deserves pats on the back

05:55.642 --> 05:59.005
for standing up for the right? I think Tom Adair. 
Tom is a solid citizen, man. He wants to win, but Tom

06:04.531 --> 06:09.561
has been the conscience, I think, of the Athletic 
Council for 15 years. That's what I thought. Yeah.

06:13.689 --> 06:25.493
To the typist, you don't need to put this in the 
final version, but I suggested Tom to Jarvis

06:13.689 --> 06:25.493
Miller to be added to the committee. there was a 
vacancy and they needed somebody from science.

06:28.797 --> 06:29.999
And they said, who do you think? And I said, I think 
that Tom, he's a good solid faculty member, good

06:30.359 --> 06:34.985
scholar. He's interested in athletics, but he's 
not going to sell out. That's right. That's right.

06:39.951 --> 06:41.193
And that's. So he had me, he and Frank Vandiver had 
me write a concept paper. We started getting a lot

06:45.778 --> 06:51.025
of pressure from soccer and lacrosse and rugby. 
And they had me write a concept paper on what club

06:51.494 --> 06:57.282
sports are versus what they got to do to earn their 
way in. And Tom then took that, you know, trusting

06:57.943 --> 07:08.698
me completely, took that to Vandiver, and that's 
how women's soccer became a Division I sport

06:57.943 --> 07:08.698
because they followed the rules. Rugby kept 
drinking the beer and raising a little hell here,

07:08.738 --> 07:13.765
you know, fighting here, but wearing A&M 
uniforms. Boy, the soccer women, they got it in

07:13.845 --> 07:19.212
line and played good competition and became a 
varsity sport. And... Vandiver did so much for

07:20.148 --> 07:24.033
this university that I think the people never 
really gave him credit for. For a second, or a

07:25.655 --> 07:33.846
little longer than a second, describe your 
impression of Chuck Sampson as Athletic Council

07:25.655 --> 07:33.846
Chairman. Chuck was so thorough, such a 
gentleman, had been a varsity tennis player at

07:34.727 --> 07:41.956
Notre Dame, so he knew competition. We all knew and 
respected him. I just see where he got the highest

07:44.519 --> 07:49.125
honor in Texas for an engineering profession. He 
knew his stuff. He loved athletics, but yet

07:53.101 --> 08:03.315
integrity was what... That's written all over 
Chuck Sampson, and you could just see it, and it

07:53.101 --> 08:03.315
prevailed, I think, with that athletic council. 
People accuse me of being a former athlete, of

08:03.716 --> 08:13.510
getting in bed with the athletics, but no, not at 
all, because I knew we had to have the kind of

08:03.716 --> 08:13.510
integrity that... We needed, because after 
having Bear Bryant years behind us and some other

08:13.878 --> 08:22.807
black marks that we shouldn't have had, I should 
say ugly marks, we were trying to make it right. Did

08:22.887 --> 08:29.074
any coach or politician or board member ever try to 
influence your vote on the council? They did when

08:29.514 --> 08:31.336
Jackie Sherrill came in here. I wasn't ready to 
hire him from my perspective. It was done without

08:35.420 --> 08:37.362
our wishes. The Board of Regents brought him in 
here over our wishes. Did anybody call you or write

08:40.305 --> 08:42.788
you about Bill McKenzie talked with me. He said, 
isn't he a good one, John? You know, we need to move

08:48.071 --> 08:49.853
into the next level. So, yeah, there was some 
pressure. I don't know whether pressure for the

08:52.796 --> 08:59.942
other people, but Bill Romaine, I guess, went to 
his grave angry over firing Tom Wilson. Tom had had

09:01.023 --> 09:03.966
an 8-2 year, but people said, oh, he's not tough 
enough. He couldn't be. We need to go after big

09:04.587 --> 09:05.888
time. And Tom never really forgave us, even though 
he sent players here. went on to win a state high

09:10.966 --> 09:12.910
school title. Did any coach ever try to twist your 
arm? Not really, not really. I didn't teach

09:20.003 --> 09:21.766
undergraduates. I remember at times I was asked by 
a basketball coach for some courses to get some

09:21.806 --> 09:29.180
kids in so they could stay eligible. But there 
wasn't any of that on the football side, RC

09:29.901 --> 09:34.189
especially. And I just really didn't get to know 
Emory that well since I'd just come on at the end of

09:34.777 --> 09:42.247
his time. But, no, there's never been an instant. 
Your perception of Marvin Tate as the athletic

09:49.576 --> 09:54.503
director during that period? I think Marvin Tate 
was so good. Articulate spokesperson, had been in

09:58.788 --> 10:03.214
business world, I don't know why. I guess over the 
coaching change and Tom Wilson thing, there was

10:05.314 --> 10:15.109
something I never really understood. But Marvin 
didn't last long after the Jackie Sherrill. We

10:21.940 --> 10:25.585
wound up with Jackie wanting to be both AD and head 
coach. Then, of course, John David Crowe came in

10:26.647 --> 10:29.431
and did that. I think Marvin probably got a bad 
deal. I thought he was very articulate. I thought

10:34.000 --> 10:34.981
he knew sports. He loved A&M. I never understood 
that one very well. Now, did he survive the

10:38.185 --> 10:41.088
Sherrill dismissal? Yeah, he survived that, but 
then he was gone as soon as, you know, he was gone

10:43.111 --> 10:53.603
soon after that. Okay. Yeah. Because he wound up 
being sort of the associate Athletic director to

10:58.747 --> 11:00.611
Cheryl, see.

11:03.838 --> 11:05.000
Does R.C. follow Cheryl? Yeah. Were you on the 
council when he was selected as head coach?

11:16.666 --> 11:17.768
I'm trying to think. I don't think so. I'd just gone 
off. Okay. Because that would have been about 1986

11:22.383 --> 11:27.595
or 678.

11:28.356 --> 11:31.623
I went off in 88. Okay. It would have been about that 
time. Yeah, about that time. I remember how elated

11:35.251 --> 11:37.536
I was when they appointed R.C. because I knew What a 
good person he was, yeah. Typist, this is not for

11:42.341 --> 11:44.605
inclusion. I'm just sharing an anecdote with him. 
One of the interesting things coming up, Bob

11:47.190 --> 11:57.648
Stull, who is the AD at UTEP, did I tell you the 
relation between him and R.C.? No, I know the name

11:58.930 --> 12:00.573
Stull, though. All right. They were half-time, 
beginning, first-year assistant, assistant

12:01.252 --> 12:08.861
coaches at Kansas State. Is that right? Years ago. 
I remember that. And one night, after some cool

12:11.865 --> 12:20.996
beverages, they did a handshake agreement that if 
either one of them ever became a head coach, he'd

12:11.865 --> 12:20.996
hire the other one. Then after that job, their 
first full-time assistant job was at Kent State,

12:21.096 --> 12:30.448
and Dick Tamburo... was the assistant athletic 
director. And the man who would later be the very,

12:34.710 --> 12:42.299
very, very fine head coach for the Washington 
Huskies, whose name escapes me right now. I don't

12:42.560 --> 12:43.441
know who you're talking about. He was their head 
coach. Yeah. And a guy who had later owned the El

12:46.465 --> 12:57.359
Paso Diablos very successful baseball franchise 
was a first-year intern sports information

12:46.465 --> 12:57.359
director. And so... Then when I hire Stull as a head 
coach for the fall of 86. Yeah, yeah, I remember

13:06.461 --> 13:08.828
that. He called RC and said, okay. I'll hire you. 
And he said R.C. told him, no, there's some things

13:15.713 --> 13:20.959
developing here that I might have a chance to be a 
head coach here. I'll be darned. And so then when I

13:22.521 --> 13:31.813
get to Missouri, Tamburo, I make him the A.D., then 
he and I hire Stull. And so now Stull is back as A.D.

13:33.776 --> 13:38.121
there, and he's going to play R.C. And another tiny 
link, both R.C. and I went to Orange High School. I

13:44.071 --> 13:46.474
knew you both went to Orange High School, yeah. 
That's right. That's good. Let's see. Other

13:48.637 --> 13:52.283
extracurricular tasks you had during all those 
years? The primary, of course, was the athletic

13:54.706 --> 14:01.215
council and the faculty senate. I was also elected 
to the first executive committee of the faculty

14:01.235 --> 14:04.260
senate. There were five of us. What did it do? It was 
a titular head, really. I mean, we were the ones

14:08.446 --> 14:13.673
that worked closely with the speaker. We then 
oversaw the committees within the Senate. And it

14:18.076 --> 14:22.940
was a pretty time-consuming thing. We got a lot of 
things done. A core curriculum came out of that. A

14:26.543 --> 14:43.018
lot of our faculty concerns, we began with 
inclusion and minority issues for faculty,

14:26.543 --> 14:43.018
recruiting faculty, changing the structure of 
the department head from more of a chair approach

14:26.543 --> 14:43.018
to more a decentralized approach. Paul Parrish 
was on that. I'm trying to think of all the other

14:46.130 --> 14:50.095
people on that. Bill Barzak was on the first. We had 
to be elected by the faculty senate. And the woman

14:54.781 --> 15:01.249
in biochemistry was on that. I can't think of her 
name. And how often did the senate and the

15:03.171 --> 15:07.897
executive committee meet? We met once a month, 
once a month. The executive committee, of course,

15:12.260 --> 15:14.203
met before the Faculty Senate met. About how many 
on the Senate? There were about 80, yeah, roughly

15:16.506 --> 15:20.411
about 80. The time you got some of the larger 
colleges had four or five representatives. We had

15:27.520 --> 15:29.142
two or three. And then we had, of course, the staff. 
Might have been about 60, I guess, probably about

15:34.409 --> 15:36.753
60. And were there some big, as you look back, Were 
there some big issues that y'all were not able to

15:40.390 --> 15:45.756
get anything, any action on? Our biggest issue was 
we had to back off on some of the humanities courses

15:45.776 --> 15:56.449
because of the so-called accreditation problems 
of the College of Engineering. And there was some

15:57.531 --> 15:59.473
consternation over that. Humanities? Yeah. 
There was consternation of not having

16:01.315 --> 16:07.883
well-educated engineers and the same battle that 
goes on all the time. Those were some of the biggest

16:08.150 --> 16:10.414
ones, I think, right there. The women issue of 
feminism, those kinds of things are just

16:10.474 --> 16:18.367
beginning to become present. And the lack of 
discussion about lack of faculty, women faculty,

16:18.808 --> 16:27.863
minority faculty. And I think it was a healthy kind 
of beginning for, the fermentation was there, I

16:28.400 --> 16:38.394
think, to begin making changes in the faces of our 
faculty. All right. Vandiver, you gave him credit

16:39.195 --> 16:43.280
for being sensitive as the president. What other 
administrators do you think were faculty senate

16:43.301 --> 16:47.707
sensitive? I think at that time we had our dean of 
faculties who'd come out of the College of

16:49.910 --> 16:57.120
Business. Clint Phillips. Clint. was very 
supportive, I thought. And having Bill Barzak

17:02.945 --> 17:13.621
involved, who had been through some of those 
chairs, just having him as part of the faculty

17:02.945 --> 17:13.621
senate was very helpful as well.

17:16.486 --> 17:22.555
Looking back on it, those were some of the major 
players, I think. There were a lot of people

17:23.294 --> 17:26.959
opposed to the Faculty Senate. And what did your 
colleagues think about your role? Well, they

17:32.947 --> 17:48.728
thought that I should be able to, one, speak well 
for the College of Education in terms of what our

17:32.947 --> 17:48.728
disciplines are, what we're trying to do, and how 
critical we are to the whole process. And they

17:49.209 --> 17:52.153
figured that I was strong enough to be able to stand 
up chin to chin with anybody in any discipline.

17:56.013 --> 17:57.054
They expected me to do that. And I did my best to do 
that as well. Did a department head or a dean ever

18:02.323 --> 18:08.132
give you any counsel about your faculty senate 
role? Not really. Because we had this

18:10.475 --> 18:14.201
subcommittee within, I would call the caucus. And 
we'd ask the dean if there's anything we needed to

18:15.062 --> 18:20.571
fight for. One thing I did fight hard for, and I 
still think it was a mistake, we needed a course in

18:20.939 --> 18:30.695
the social sciences and education on what 
education is all about in America. So every

18:31.216 --> 18:44.938
undergraduate here who winds up on school boards 
or supporting schools to understand what they

18:31.216 --> 18:44.938
are, education as a discipline, what it is, and I 
fought for that and tried to get it entered, and I

18:31.216 --> 18:44.938
couldn't get enough support even within the 
college because they didn't know who was going to

18:31.216 --> 18:44.938
teach it. So I'm not for it unless my department. 
That's right. That's right. And I thought it had

18:50.074 --> 18:51.355
been a great idea. I remember fighting that with 
two or three of them. Our caucus really thought

18:53.357 --> 18:55.119
that made sense. You know, if you understand what 
political science is about, once you understand

18:55.899 --> 19:08.031
that education is the key to our country, why not 
have a good, interesting, fascinating course,

18:55.899 --> 19:08.031
not a boring course, on the politics and the 
history of American education. So that was an

19:08.071 --> 19:11.054
issue we fought on that I didn't win on. Now, you 
said you're going to a 4 o'clock. Yeah, 4 o'clock.

19:13.737 --> 19:15.178
What time do you want to take off? Ten more minutes, 
I'm fine. Okay. When Frank Hubert became

19:19.683 --> 19:26.032
chancellor, what happened in the college in terms 
of leadership? Well, we started the search, and a

19:26.552 --> 19:39.651
few of us were interested in becoming dean after 
that because I was being invited to apply

19:26.552 --> 19:39.651
elsewhere. And we had other candidates who were 
qualified or better than I, but... We found Dean

19:44.200 --> 19:46.263
Corrigan. He was dean at the University of 
Maryland. He came in here and interviewed, and

19:48.787 --> 19:51.872
everybody was very impressed with him. He was not 
an authoritarian. He was a totally different

19:55.517 --> 19:58.321
personality from Frank Hubert. As far as you 
recall, was he the general favorite of the group?

20:09.939 --> 20:12.503
Yes, very much so. He proved to be a really good 
dean. He was more effective externally than he was

20:15.246 --> 20:21.073
internally, in my opinion. He was working with 
Ross Perot on a key committee to determine where we

20:21.553 --> 20:25.037
went. We lost some ground there in terms of only 18 
hours of education and lost a so-called education

20:25.137 --> 20:32.025
major. But he fought hard on Perot on that one. He 
did some good stuff with us in terms of inquiry

20:35.790 --> 20:39.915
groups, doing a lot of interdisciplinary kinds of 
things. But he was a kind, thoughtful, bright

20:39.935 --> 20:42.658
person. who never embarrassed us in any way, and as 
far as I know, never intimidated anybody like past

20:43.162 --> 20:51.416
deans who will go unmentioned. After he left, we 
had a bad situation here. We brought in a person, a

20:54.541 --> 20:57.967
woman from University of Houston, Stallings. In 
many ways, she was very divisive, and the college

20:59.549 --> 21:06.982
almost, it was like, really it was a vote of no 
confidence for her. Was there a real search? Not a

21:09.807 --> 21:11.610
really good search, I think. We did a real search, 
but somehow, and the people at the University of

21:11.971 --> 21:19.704
Houston, she was department head down there, said 
she wasn't an administrator. But she had a lot of

21:19.925 --> 21:26.697
federal grants, had a big name, and the provost 
wanted somebody who could bring in money to the

21:19.925 --> 21:26.697
college like other colleges do. Which provost? 
McDonnell. McDonnell? Yeah. And she had a lot of

21:31.645 --> 21:33.008
grants. Was there... Was there a perception that 
there was a deliberate effort to hire a female? I

21:39.778 --> 21:40.319
think so. And this was a good college to start in 
since we tend to have a lot of women in the program. I

21:46.310 --> 21:47.893
don't think there's any question about that. And 
she had the name. Hold her on the scholarship. But

21:52.442 --> 21:58.393
from the get-go, she was not an administrator and 
didn't understand how to be an administrator. and

21:59.133 --> 22:01.656
almost tore the college apart. She lasted how 
long? Three years. Two, really. Now, Dean

22:06.341 --> 22:10.265
Corrigan ceased being dean. Why? He was just ready 
to do something else. He got the Harrington chair,

22:13.789 --> 22:18.955
you know, is in our department, and I think he just, 
he was tired. Because there certainly was no

22:19.376 --> 22:21.518
dissatisfaction. There was no dissatisfaction, 
not at all, except for us losing that power base

22:21.538 --> 22:27.705
across the state. We'll never understand why we 
didn't have enough influence and why he didn't

22:28.242 --> 22:35.290
have enough influence with his name and with his 
prestige. And I think in many ways he may have felt

22:35.590 --> 22:41.577
like that he may have disappointed some of us. But I 
don't think in terms of our wishing he would step

22:42.718 --> 22:47.103
out, there was none of that. But man, there was with 
Stallings from the get-go. Then following her.

22:53.710 --> 22:55.532
Station-wide search. I went back on Stallings. We 
had a guy hired named Miller from Missouri. I think

23:03.011 --> 23:03.812
his name's Miller. He was either dean at the 
University of Missouri at the time or had been at

23:05.515 --> 23:09.461
the University of Missouri. I think that's right. 
Yeah. We had him hired. But the provost said no. We

23:15.890 --> 23:16.952
don't want him. He had sort of an industrial arts 
vocational background. And then she gets the job.

23:23.081 --> 23:25.705
And that made a lot of people mad because they'd 
gone through the search. Jane came to us, having

23:26.225 --> 23:32.131
not been a dean, been an associate dean, Jane 
Connolly. But wait, following Stallings, is Jane

23:32.291 --> 23:37.917
Connolly next? Yeah. Jane, Jane. It was a problem 
with some of us getting the right name. She came in

23:42.621 --> 23:46.545
without experience, having been an 
administrator, but a good scholar. And this is

23:46.946 --> 23:47.906
about when? That's been four years ago. Okay. Some 
of us had concern because of being an Ed Psych type

23:54.929 --> 24:02.621
who may not have the background link to make the 
links. The problem is a lot of the Ed

24:02.641 --> 24:06.106
Administration types don't want to be deans. They 
just don't want to do that, and so the Ed Psych

24:08.230 --> 24:16.903
people come in who aren't administrative 
trained, who are not public school people

24:08.230 --> 24:16.903
usually, and so we were a little leery about that. 
But she's come in and she's done a wonderful job.

24:21.647 --> 24:23.028
She's dealt with some tough issues. But I think 
she's been very successful, much better

24:23.629 --> 24:33.017
administrator, much better.

24:36.300 --> 24:44.848
She, Stallings was trying in many ways to change 
the gender balance too quickly. And Jane's come in

24:45.993 --> 24:50.077
with people of color and gender and balanced them 
really well. So that's the difference. One used a

24:52.018 --> 24:54.521
hammer, one used a shoehorn.

24:57.624 --> 24:58.985
Let's stop there. Okay.

25:06.492 --> 25:07.873
August 31st.

25:10.255 --> 25:12.837
John, some missed opportunities. Can you think of 
any missed opportunities that this college might

25:16.250 --> 25:20.854
have taken advantage of? Yes. I think the effort 
coming out of the land-grant tradition of really

25:23.516 --> 25:44.535
becoming a service institution as well as a 
research-based institution, I think in the

25:23.516 --> 25:44.535
spirit of this university really, this college, 
trying to be so careful about modeling the liberal

25:45.055 --> 25:55.525
arts and science colleges in terms of its type of 
scholarship. I truly believe that we've had

25:55.546 --> 26:04.194
several opportunities to truly become a service 
university for the state of Texas and the nation.

26:05.275 --> 26:09.319
We have outstanding researchers. We've done some 
wonderful things in collaboration with schools.

26:12.663 --> 26:22.881
We started here under Dean Corrigan, an inquiry 
group, and started working with school systems to

26:12.663 --> 26:22.881
set up a research collaborative. Well, that went 
by the wayside when Corrigan left. And the whole

26:27.068 --> 26:32.798
idea on being a reservoir of creating knowledge. 
opposed

26:33.267 --> 26:58.650
to really emphasizing the service elements and 
helping the schools especially urban schools

26:33.267 --> 26:58.650
let's call them to the wayside that we're doing a 
lot of new things but we're just now trying to

26:33.267 --> 26:58.650
recover from that because we so i think in the long 
run as a professional school we may have lost

26:33.267 --> 26:58.650
something lost some opportunities that uh not to 
make you recover but there's some there's still

26:59.069 --> 27:14.631
some damage i think

26:59.069 --> 27:14.631
um i think And one

27:15.235 --> 27:37.564
of

27:15.235 --> 27:37.564
the efforts we tried to, I think, reach out in the 
late 80s, our department dr erlinson and i worked

27:38.219 --> 28:04.800
together to create a one of the first cohort 
doctoral programs in the country that was really

27:38.219 --> 28:04.800
workable where we looked at the edd program people 
who could not come in full-time for residency and

27:38.219 --> 28:04.800
actually build a cohort where we select them 
together from the school district and each of

27:38.219 --> 28:04.800
those people not only working doctors they were 
contributing into the school district and we

27:38.219 --> 28:04.800
built some tremendous liaisons in fact we hired 
the superintendent from San Antonio gave these

28:05.590 --> 28:32.526
fees to be on our clinical faculty.

28:33.063 --> 29:00.792
so-called

29:01.058 --> 29:15.441
And

29:01.058 --> 29:15.441
I'm meeting

29:01.058 --> 29:15.441
this next week with the gentlemen from Richardson 
Foundation. They've asked me to take on this

29:15.461 --> 29:20.509
challenge of developing a document for the future 
of superintendents in Texas in a time of great

29:15.461 --> 29:20.509
change where superintendents are aging and where 
schools and universities have to build a bridge.

29:20.529 --> 29:22.392
And I've written a piece, I think I told you last 
week, We

29:22.675 --> 29:34.112
want

29:22.675 --> 29:34.112
to be highly productive. We want to produce

29:34.132 --> 29:43.907
in the journals that are seen scholarly. Not

29:43.887 --> 30:11.059
the way I would like it to happen. Yeah,

30:11.444 --> 30:18.814
we've got partnerships. We've got

30:19.394 --> 30:26.804
public school, university liaisons going of all 
kinds. But in terms of a financial commitment, in

30:26.824 --> 30:32.111
terms of a state political commitment, no. We're 
still K-12 and higher ed, and don't let those funds

30:32.131 --> 30:33.553
get mixed up.

30:42.629 --> 30:46.345
I think probably University of North Texas. is

30:46.713 --> 31:07.879
really,

30:46.713 --> 31:07.879
come on, that's

30:46.713 --> 31:07.879
gonna do these big things in the Metroplex. I think 
UT Arlington. UT Arlington has a wonderful

31:08.339 --> 31:09.261
national program. They've got the British 
Foundation of Money, and they actually have a

31:09.281 --> 31:14.867
superintendent in their entire area, so that's a 
big star, and give them a full-time paid

31:09.281 --> 31:14.867
internship, and you do your degree through the UTA 
program there. That is a wonderful program. I

31:15.468 --> 31:16.129
think, probably, Thank

31:16.109 --> 31:29.629
you.
