WEBVTT

01:30.599 --> 01:33.563
by a contract from the Office of Naval Research. So 
that has slipped into the CV, but it's not really, I

01:35.106 --> 01:41.455
was not an employee of ONR. I was supported by them, 
but not an employee. Well, what is the ONR's

01:45.000 --> 01:51.009
connection with the Duke Marine Lab?

01:52.411 --> 01:55.395
Well, it'll be the same as it has with a number of 
other marine laboratories. They have an umbrella

01:55.495 --> 01:59.982
contract involving about five of us. 
bio-deterioration, studies on fouling

02:02.915 --> 02:16.559
organisms, boring organisms, physiology of 
shell deposition, things that are of interest to

02:02.915 --> 02:16.559
the Navy, and that's the only real official 
connection that we have. Now, I noticed, though,

02:16.939 --> 02:23.310
that you also were attached to an old NR facility in 
London. Okay, now that's legit. I had an 18-month

02:25.193 --> 02:28.399
year leave of absence from Duke. to serve as a 
so-called liaison scientist in oceanography and

02:29.155 --> 02:34.762
marine biology, ONR London. And at that time, I was 
officially a civilian employee of the Department

02:36.444 --> 02:42.111
of the Navy. And what exactly does a liaison 
officer in London, let's say, do in terms of advice

02:43.332 --> 02:50.601
to ONR? Well, the primary objective was to visit as 
many marine oceanographic facilities as

02:50.621 --> 02:57.610
possible in Europe. Talk with people about trends 
in research. And then on your return to London,

03:03.706 --> 03:17.102
write up an article for what's known as European 
Scientific Notes, published monthly by the

03:03.706 --> 03:17.102
London office, distributed to over maybe 3,000 
people in the United States. And the articles that

03:18.624 --> 03:28.255
you write give an impression of the laboratories 
that you visit, the programs that are there, the

03:18.624 --> 03:28.255
facilities they have for research. ever interest 
they may have on having American scientists work

03:28.471 --> 03:32.316
there. Indications of an interest in cooperative 
research. So it's to primarily keep the U.S.

03:37.883 --> 03:45.413
scientific community informed on trends in 
Europe. Has there traditionally always been one

03:46.355 --> 03:51.702
American scientist attached to the ONR in London? 
Oh, at the time I was there, there were About 35.

03:56.208 --> 03:56.729
About 35. And 17 of them were civilians 
representing not just oceanography. They go

04:01.774 --> 04:04.897
everything from anthropology to zoology. And the 
other 17 were blue suitors, so-called, line Navy

04:05.778 --> 04:15.549
officers who had a more applied mission-oriented 
interest, but it was the same sort of thing. They

04:16.470 --> 04:24.398
would visit the admiralty office or admiralty 
labs or French or Western German

04:27.652 --> 04:28.313
the academic.

04:32.458 --> 04:38.485
Has this been your primary connection with ONR, 
then your tour of duty, so to speak, in London? Oh,

04:39.586 --> 04:40.547
yeah. I've always had a reasonably close contact 
since the old days of Sid Gallop. Sid was in charge

04:45.212 --> 04:56.005
of oceanic biology, ONR, Washington for many 
years, and I think got me started on my

04:45.212 --> 04:56.005
international interest. Okay, that's the point 
I'm trying to move us to. You're deeply involved

05:00.976 --> 05:12.292
all through your career with international 
organizations, and that seems to be the striking

05:00.976 --> 05:12.292
point about your career in terms of sitting in the 
Senate. How do you explain that? How did that

05:13.594 --> 05:14.455
happen? Well, I remember the phone conversation. 
In 1957, I received a formal invitation from

05:17.439 --> 05:25.030
Professor Crisp, now a fellow of the Royal 
Society, then director of a small lab at Bangor,

05:25.668 --> 05:42.148
Wales, inviting me to present a paper at the 15th 
International Congress of Zoology in a section

05:25.668 --> 05:42.148
that was devoted to barnacles and celebrating the 
Darwin Centennial. I was then just barely out of

05:43.570 --> 05:53.262
graduate school, and of course it came as quite a 
thrill, but the sad part of it was I didn't have a

05:43.570 --> 05:53.262
cent. So, nothing ventured, nothing gained. I 
called O&R Washington.

06:08.984 --> 06:09.505
You can turn it off again. Sure. Didn't have any 
money. Right. What is happening is that you have no

06:11.527 --> 06:15.492
money and you said nothing ventured, nothing 
gained. Right. Which I mean, I assume you called

06:15.913 --> 06:17.415
O&R. So I called Sid Gower, who I knew casually, and 
told him about the invitations. and asked if it

06:23.077 --> 06:28.247
would be possible to get some financial support 
through ONR to permit me to participate. And Sid

06:29.610 --> 06:38.347
indicated that under one primary condition, and 
that would be that I would not be permitted to go

06:29.610 --> 06:38.347
directly to London in return. I would have to agree 
to visit at least one British marine laboratory.

06:44.474 --> 06:48.558
which, of course, was ridiculous because I would 
have given my ITs to visit several. So I

06:49.338 --> 06:57.046
reluctantly accepted the conditions, and he 
provided me with what was then known as Military

06:49.338 --> 06:57.046
Air Transportation Service travel. And that got 
me started in the London meeting where I met all

06:58.587 --> 07:10.838
sorts of people from all over the world, visited 
the Scottish Marine Biological Laboratory

06:58.587 --> 07:10.838
afterwards in Oban. Well, it's now in Oban. It used 
to be in Millport. Then went down to the big marine

07:13.432 --> 07:18.680
biological lab in Plymouth, met a lot of that 
crowd. So when I came home, I had started to become

07:19.000 --> 07:25.690
familiar with a number of European scientists. 
And it just seems to have continued, the contacts

07:26.752 --> 07:32.300
that I made then.

07:34.884 --> 07:40.292
International Association of Biological 
Oceanographic Research. YABO. YABO. What is

07:42.135 --> 07:42.696
that? Well, there is a whole hierarchy of 
international associations. I think it's ICSU,

07:49.635 --> 08:02.415
International Council of Scientific Unions, and 
under that umbrella you have international

07:49.635 --> 08:02.415
associations of virtually every discipline, one 
of which is YABO. And this is a relatively recent

08:04.037 --> 08:12.430
effort to coordinate and improve communications 
between people within any one discipline

08:12.697 --> 08:24.733
directly rather than having them go through some 
common

08:12.697 --> 08:24.733
larger framework. Did this evolve out of your 
international experience, international

08:24.753 --> 08:28.238
cooperation? Well, the organization itself 
evolved quite independently of me. I had nothing

08:31.622 --> 08:42.096
to do with that, but presumably my position with it 
now is a direct result of my earlier involvement

08:31.622 --> 08:42.096
with international

08:45.856 --> 08:51.983
Okay,

08:45.856 --> 08:51.983
what is your present position? Right now, I'm the 
chairman of the U.S. group of YABO, and if things at

08:52.404 --> 09:13.129
the Edinburgh meetings progress the way I assume 
they will, I will wind up being secretary for YABO

08:52.404 --> 09:13.129
on a whole international base.

09:13.953 --> 09:16.277
Obviously, you favor international 
cooperation. Oh, very definitely. Do you think

09:18.179 --> 09:32.741
that the new legislation and negotiations being 
worked on in terms of treaties and the

09:18.179 --> 09:32.741
underdeveloped countries claiming 200 and 
possibly other model limits will interfere with

09:18.179 --> 09:32.741
international cooperation? Certainly it will, 
but the treaties are strictly political. They're

09:39.812 --> 09:41.074
not scientific at all. And we'll just take, as we 
always do, whatever's left. Okay, and what will be

09:46.941 --> 09:50.526
the organization's opinion? YOLO? Yeah. Will 
they try to negotiate? I doubt that they'll have

09:53.630 --> 09:57.315
any say in the matter. In other words, you're

09:57.335 --> 10:06.066
inclined to think then the agreements will be 
politically arrived at without any scientific

09:57.335 --> 10:06.066
input into it? with very little scientific input. 
And if it's a question of a political decision

10:10.457 --> 10:16.684
versus a scientific decision, it will always go 
political. What effect do you think this will have

10:17.765 --> 10:20.969
on oceanography? Will, for example, physical 
oceanography be limited by these decisions?

10:28.817 --> 10:31.540
Physical and geological. Because the only real 
base for the whole treaty is to provide access to

10:33.822 --> 10:57.518
raw materials on the part of the country that 
thinks they own them uh do you think that that

10:33.822 --> 10:57.518
international organizations will play a role 
later on and then trying to renegotiate

10:33.822 --> 10:57.518
activities of let's say physical and geological 
oceanography Oh, I'm sure that there will be a long

10:57.970 --> 11:04.900
progression, just as there has been already in the 
Law of the Sea discussions that will go on ad

10:57.970 --> 11:04.900
nauseum. Now, how did you become connected with 
the NSF programs in India?

11:15.236 --> 11:17.379
Through O&R London.

11:24.209 --> 11:27.454
While I was there as a liaison scientist, the 
captain wanted someone to go to Delhi for a

11:28.463 --> 11:32.447
meeting. And somehow I fell into that slot. So I 
went. And then two months later, the captain

11:37.733 --> 11:50.386
wanted someone who was an expert on India to take 
three Washington VIPs on a tour of marine

11:37.733 --> 11:50.386
facilities in India. Since I was the only member of 
the staff that had ever been anywhere in India, I

11:50.867 --> 11:55.652
was the expert. And on that second tour, I met some 
number of Indian scientists and got to know them

11:56.594 --> 12:03.182
and communicated with them. The whole thing 
evolved from that contact. And when NSF wanted

12:08.169 --> 12:13.255
somebody to go over there for several things, they 
asked me if I would go. Since I knew the people, I

12:13.516 --> 12:14.797
went. Is marine biology making significant 
strides in that part of the world?

12:22.848 --> 12:24.610
I wouldn't say significant, no. Of course, it's 
been several years and the whole political

12:26.243 --> 12:30.449
climate there has changed since I was there. It 
could, but there are some number of traditions

12:30.509 --> 12:43.808
that are going to have to be broken down before 
there's much really achieved. In your opinion,

12:45.651 --> 12:54.023
will international cooperation, as you conceive 
of it, bring direct aid to underdeveloped

12:45.651 --> 12:54.023
countries?

12:56.551 --> 12:57.192
such as India?

13:00.956 --> 13:04.040
Only if the political climate of the country 
encourages it. And the reason I qualify that,

13:04.701 --> 13:11.269
there has been a so-called PL-480 program in India 
for 20 years. And the Indian politicians are very

13:12.791 --> 13:23.664
reluctant to give it free reign because of what 
they feel would be a threat to the economy plus a

13:12.791 --> 13:23.664
threat to their jurisdiction. Now, who sponsors 
the PL-480 program? Oh, it's like a piece of pie

13:26.960 --> 13:33.368
that is cut up by some number of different U.S. 
agencies. EPA, NOAA, ONR, NSF, AID, the Congress.

13:43.461 --> 13:43.641
Okay. And I somehow or another have you contacted 
with, or you connected with the PL-480 program and

13:44.362 --> 13:52.092
the Smithsonian Institution at the same time. Is 
that possible? Oh yeah, because the Smithsonian

13:52.953 --> 13:55.296
has a piece of the pie. Okay, and what was your 
relationship with the Smithsonian and PL-480?

13:58.796 --> 14:14.871
Okay, the Smithsonian ran its PL-480 programs in a 
rather unique way, in that they set up an advisory

13:58.796 --> 14:14.871
committee of scientists, one for biological 
sciences, and I happened to serve on that

13:58.796 --> 14:14.871
committee for about three years. And they insist 
that on any excess currency program, there must be

14:16.268 --> 14:26.259
a U.S. scientist as a counterpart to the scientist 
from that country. So it's not just an effort to

14:27.340 --> 14:39.053
provide financial support to the scientist of 
some country, but it's to try to tie it to the U.S.

14:27.340 --> 14:39.053
scientific community. but through my 
involvement with their biological advisory

14:39.674 --> 14:50.310
committee and visiting some number of their 
facilities and programs, I got rather

14:39.674 --> 14:50.310
knowledgeable. And exactly what would you do in 
terms of your activities with PL-480?

14:57.020 --> 14:58.863
Smithsonian. We would review proposals that had 
been submitted by U.S. scientists, usually with

14:59.123 --> 15:09.158
the scientists from one of the other PL-480 
countries, and then either recommend that it be

15:10.454 --> 15:17.363
funded or recommend that it not be funded or 
recommend that it be modified and reconsidered.

15:19.085 --> 15:19.225
Okay. And

15:19.245 --> 15:28.357
in your opinion, what countries seem to work the 
best in the PL-480 program?

15:32.122 --> 15:36.468
Well, the Yugoslavs had a very efficient program 
going. Israel undoubtedly would be the top of the

15:37.629 --> 15:40.393
list. But it was not really a, they had an advantage 
in that many of their scientists are trained in

15:41.588 --> 15:47.138
this country. They speak English almost as well as 
they do their own language. They have a lot of

15:51.406 --> 15:56.816
traditions and customs which are common to this 
country. So they started out from a much closer

15:57.016 --> 16:05.892
working base than someone, say, in India

15:57.016 --> 16:05.892
would. or would you venture to compare, for 
example, scientific programs overseas and

16:07.289 --> 16:14.678
scientific programs in the United States? Yeah, 
it's possible.

16:21.947 --> 16:29.235
If you start out with, say, West Germany, their 
level of science is very similar to ours. England,

16:30.457 --> 16:35.743
depending on the discipline, now if we're talking 
about oceanography,

16:37.276 --> 16:42.424
Some of their oceanographic programs are 
certainly equal to the better ones in this

16:37.276 --> 16:42.424
country. Then you begin to get into a pretty gray 
area. France, there's a lot more exception there.

16:51.499 --> 16:53.262
Italy, there's still more exception. The 
Scandinavian countries in certain specific

16:54.183 --> 17:00.894
subdivisions of the discipline, they're easily 
equal to us. Others, they may not be. Soviet Union,

17:04.546 --> 17:09.731
in certain specific areas, they are equal to us. In 
others, they're about where we were in the early

17:11.172 --> 17:13.675
30s. And once you've covered those countries, and 
I can't speak to East Germany because I've never

17:15.116 --> 17:33.473
been there, but then you begin to get into a whole 
third tier of countries where they don't really

17:15.116 --> 17:33.473
have a very well-organized or a very modern 
oceanographic program.

17:36.254 --> 17:37.816
is another story entirely. Japan, very possibly 
in the realm of especially fisheries, would

17:39.418 --> 17:46.608
easily be equal to us, but in pure oceanography, 
no. It has seemed, and I certainly can stand to be

17:49.032 --> 18:04.573
corrected on this, it has seemed that the ONR gave a 
great deal of direction to our beginnings as a

17:49.032 --> 18:04.573
country in oceanography, in formal oceanography 
after World War II. Do you feel that ONR still gives

18:04.942 --> 18:07.925
that kind of direction?

18:10.688 --> 18:13.050
Well, I couldn't agree more with your first 
statement. There's no doubt in my mind that we owe

18:13.130 --> 18:24.141
the early development, the period of 45-50, the 
early development of oceanography almost

18:13.130 --> 18:24.141
exclusively to ONR. Then, with the birth of NSF, 
some of the role of ONR was taken over. And I'm sure

18:31.148 --> 18:39.702
others have commented that many of the staff who 
had been in ONR went with NSF. And then, of course,

18:39.722 --> 18:51.743
later you had the birth of some number of other 
granting agencies, and AEC began to take over some

18:39.722 --> 18:51.743
minor role, now more major, in coastal 
oceanography. Eventually you had NOAA. But NOAA

18:56.242 --> 19:05.596
has never assumed any of the role that ONR had in the 
sense of support of oceanography through grants.

19:05.616 --> 19:08.800
They've tried to do it in-house with varying 
degrees of success.

19:11.444 --> 19:22.320
So the role has been diversified, and many of the 
things that ONR did in the 45-50 period are now done

19:11.444 --> 19:22.320
by other people, but not necessarily any more 
efficiently. Do you think the diversification

19:22.661 --> 19:24.223
was a good thing?

19:30.127 --> 19:52.887
Well, if you consider the emphasis which was put on 
ONR's support several years ago toward

19:30.127 --> 19:52.887
mission-oriented research, if that had happened 
without NSF being in existence, I think it would

19:30.127 --> 19:52.887
have been a real blow to basic oceanography. But 
the fact that NSF was available to pick up some of

19:54.088 --> 20:00.133
the pieces lessened the impact Diversification 
usually is pretty good if there's any real effort

20:00.772 --> 20:11.088
to coordinate and see to it that there's not too 
much duplication.

20:11.869 --> 20:16.717
I want to return back to NSF in a second with the IDOE 
program. But before I move you away from ONR, I want

20:17.158 --> 20:24.790
to ask you a series of specific questions that are 
almost random. What is your connection with CG

20:25.190 --> 20:28.956
Bookout? He was my major professor. He and I have 
published together on 70 or 80 publications. He

20:39.427 --> 20:44.134
was the director of this laboratory before I 
became director. And he's a good friend. Is it his

20:47.479 --> 20:52.045
influence that turns you toward the study of 
crustacean lava?

20:56.131 --> 20:57.353
Certainly up to a point. We started working 
together when I was a graduate student. barnacle

21:00.796 --> 21:03.280
shell development. And I became intrigued by the 
fact that you can't really study development of a

21:03.300 --> 21:13.294
shell unless you know the larval stages that 
contribute to the adult that grows the shell. And

21:13.314 --> 21:17.279
that led to a study of a number of aspects of 
crustacean development. So you could say yes. But

21:21.165 --> 21:23.308
there were a number of other people who influenced 
that. Good. I was going to say, who else would you

21:24.029 --> 21:30.398
consider big, as we see in history, during the 
1950s, shaping your career? One name stands out

21:30.479 --> 21:43.316
perhaps above all, and that's Gunnar Thorsen, who 
was the man who developed the laboratory at

21:30.479 --> 21:43.316
Elsinore following the Second World War. He was 
professor at Copenhagen. I came to know him quite

21:46.640 --> 21:47.962
well. He visited here some number of times, and his 
47th publication on the larval development of

21:48.622 --> 21:59.997
Danish marine bottom invertebrates became a 
Bible for me when I was a graduate student. And

22:00.702 --> 22:02.604
again, one of those crazy coincidences. My first 
semester at Duke, I was required, as were all

22:04.265 --> 22:14.334
graduate students, to give a report to my peers on 
some research publication. I thrashed around

22:15.355 --> 22:18.718
trying to find an appropriate one that I liked, and 
I couldn't. So Bookie shoved Gunnar's tome at me

22:18.738 --> 22:24.804
and said, here, why don't you do this one? So I did. 
And the more I read it, the more intrigued I got. I'm

22:29.288 --> 22:34.113
sure that Thorson was one of the primary 
motivating things. Anyone else? Well, there's

22:37.196 --> 22:39.118
quite a collection of people. I would like to think 
that Dennis Crisp influenced my thinking along

22:41.020 --> 22:45.365
that line. Although at that time he was not that 
actively involved in studies on larvae, he was in

22:46.646 --> 22:52.312
barnacles. And Harold Barnes, who I guess is the 
second best-known British scientist in the realm

22:52.332 --> 22:59.059
of Barnacle Research and with whom I attempted to 
work that year that I spent at Millport. He

23:06.142 --> 23:11.548
influenced my thinking for better or for worse.

23:11.568 --> 23:15.652
Okay, I have another problem with you too at Duke. I 
have you listed as a marine zoologist and later as a

23:15.672 --> 23:21.297
research associate.

23:23.800 --> 23:27.584
Well, I think this is some of the academia 
gibberish really. Okay. Apparently, you have to

23:29.397 --> 23:31.759
have a label of some sort. And a research associate 
in the term that is used there meant that I was not an

23:33.161 --> 23:40.248
appointed faculty member. I was working on soft 
money research grants for a long time. And during

23:45.714 --> 23:48.857
that period, I would have been labeled as a 
research associate. But you were still

23:49.017 --> 23:51.580
nevertheless working with crustaceans. Oh, yes. 
Okay. I was afraid for a while you were and a while

23:53.102 --> 23:55.464
you weren't. No, no. never really deviated from 
the crustacean realm. Okay, and crustacea,

24:00.219 --> 24:06.207
that's always been your interest as a marine 
biologist and oceanographer. Has your interest

24:06.227 --> 24:12.494
always centered primarily around coastal 
activity? Largely, although certain things have

24:12.514 --> 24:22.286
led me farther out into the ocean than others like 
this, the whole concept of distribution of

24:12.514 --> 24:22.286
larvae. Have you made any international voyages 
with other countries?

24:29.236 --> 24:30.277
Not really, no.

24:37.663 --> 24:46.571
Now,

24:37.663 --> 24:46.571
when I have you becoming active in NSF, I am with 
you. What were the goals of the International

24:46.891 --> 24:52.617
Decade of Exploration, the IDOE? Oh, boy.

24:57.281 --> 24:57.741
Well, You mean the political goals or the 
scientific goals? Scientific goals.

25:06.095 --> 25:21.030
Well, presumably it was to improve our 
understanding of the oceans and contribute to a

25:06.095 --> 25:21.030
more efficient use of the natural resources 
therein in the interest of the welfare of mankind.

25:25.135 --> 25:29.179
Was it oriented towards ecology in terms of 
scientific goals?

25:33.513 --> 25:39.139
Well, now, when you say ecology, do you mean it in 
the scientific sense or in the public sense of

25:33.513 --> 25:39.139
environment? I mean the public sense of 
environment. I don't think so. There are four

25:44.324 --> 25:54.294
subdivisions of IDOE, and almost all of them are 
oriented toward scientific objectives rather

25:44.324 --> 25:54.294
than environmental objectives. Well, then what 
is the systematics and ecology program? That's

25:58.918 --> 26:01.981
within NSF, but not within IDOE. Right. Okay. This 
is a subdivision of NSF which receives and reviews

26:04.243 --> 26:27.189
and supports research programs by American 
scientists dealing with systematics and ecology

26:04.243 --> 26:27.189
of terrestrial, freshwater, or estuarine marine 
animals and plants. But it has nothing to do with

26:28.370 --> 26:29.571
IDOE. But it never had any connection with IDOE? 
No. Okay. The IDOE is administered by a totally

26:33.655 --> 26:49.736
separate, discrete division of the National 
Science

26:33.655 --> 26:49.736
Foundation.

26:49.756 --> 26:53.821
Well, what exactly was your role in the 
Systematics of Ecology program? I've never had

26:53.841 --> 26:54.482
any. Never had any. I have you contacted with them 
for some reason. Heaven only knows why.
