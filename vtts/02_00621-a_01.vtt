00:01.212 --> 00:04.361
1976, Tryon, North Carolina. Butler King Cooper, 
C-O-U-P-E-R, oceanographer, GS-14, retired

00:05.645 --> 00:15.593
from the Old Bureau of Ships.

00:18.880 --> 00:34.423
Before I retired from the Bureau of Ships, I made a 
tape from an administrative history of the Bureau

00:18.880 --> 00:34.423
of Ships during World War II, prepared by the 
historical section of the Bureau of Ships, which I

00:18.880 --> 00:34.423
think is now in the Washington Navy Yard. A copy of 
this book, I feel sure, can be gotten at the NAVSEA

00:35.364 --> 00:45.259
Library in National City in Arlington. where the 
other officers that I will speak of are located.

00:49.682 --> 00:58.354
The strike number is W-E-M-U-S-5-5-7,

00:49.682 --> 00:58.354
Volume 4. Ms. Lucille Ockower, head of the library 
in the National City, now Sea Library, will be able

00:59.575 --> 01:08.407
to find it or get it for you.

01:12.433 --> 01:16.478
I believe that offices are still established west 
of the airport in Washington on highway number one

01:16.762 --> 01:23.448
at National City in building three.

01:27.091 --> 01:33.337
Carl Mayfield, M-A-Y-F-I-E-L-D, is probably 
still the division head. Under him is a sonar

01:34.518 --> 01:37.100
section. All this is sonar design. One of the 
sections is under Kerry Smith, and under him is a

01:46.394 --> 01:51.480
man by the name of Alfred Franceschetti. I'll 
spell it. F-R-A-N-C-E-S-C-H-E-T-T-I.

02:00.390 --> 02:16.148
He is the oceanographer for the Bureau of Ships 
now, and in his file may be so many unclassified

02:00.390 --> 02:16.148
items of interest, as the dates of different 
programs and purports like Tenoch and likely

02:16.567 --> 02:23.116
beginning of the informal Coordinating 
Committee for Oceanography and other items of

02:16.567 --> 02:23.116
that kind. I suggest that you consult Ms. Ockower 
at the library for locations, code, and room

02:23.877 --> 02:37.815
numbers that will help you in finding the sonar 
design section of NAV CSEA.

02:54.755 --> 03:05.710
And this tape are unclassified and were prepared 
by the Bureau of Ships Historical Section, which I

02:54.755 --> 03:05.710
believe now is located down at the Washington Navy 
Yard.

03:08.474 --> 03:23.074
It was my good fortune to be at Woods Hole from 
August 1941

03:08.474 --> 03:23.074
until February 1942 as a civilian. I then went into 
the Navy as a specialist officer in charge of bathy

03:23.763 --> 03:30.490
thermographs. While at Woods Hole, I had the 
pleasure of working with Alfred Woodcock, who was

03:32.211 --> 03:53.432
the first bathy thermograph observer on the 
Atlantis, and Morris Ewing's brother, John

03:32.211 --> 03:53.432
Ewing, a boy named Rusty Tyro, I think it was, 
Tyrus. from Texas and myself for bathy

03:53.547 --> 04:13.410
thermograph observers on the second cruise for 
bathy thermograph observations across the Gulf

03:53.547 --> 04:13.410
Stream and in the mixing area east of Nova Scotia in 
September and October 1941. The first class of ten

04:13.490 --> 04:23.301
engines each were sent to Woods Hole for training 
and graduated before Pearl Harbor. I can remember

04:26.742 --> 04:41.980
with considerable nostalgia the 
you-take-this-one-I-take-that-one method by

04:26.742 --> 04:41.980
which the boys determined which ocean they would 
go into without any realization of what was ahead

04:26.742 --> 04:41.980
for them. In February of 1942, I joined the Navy. I 
was assigned to bureau of ships in the sonar design

04:47.527 --> 04:51.972
section. The head of this section was then a 
commander by the name of Rawson Bennett II. He

04:59.371 --> 05:06.901
later became Rear Admiral Rawson Bennett and was 
Chief of Naval Research when he retired or shortly

04:59.371 --> 05:06.901
thereafter.

05:09.464 --> 05:15.512
On this man and on the fact that Roger Revelle came 
in from Scripps, in November of 42 hangs more

05:15.863 --> 05:24.232
oceanography than history will probably ever be 
able to record.

05:27.136 --> 05:41.451
I have given to Dr. Calvert a copy of a memorandum 
for file written by Rawson Bennett called

05:27.136 --> 05:41.451
Oceanography in the Bureau of Ships, dictated in 
1953 after it was all over. I stayed in the Bureau of

05:43.574 --> 05:45.516
Ships from February 1942 until October of that 
year, during which times the beginnings of the

05:45.901 --> 06:05.689
many large contracts for bathy thermograph 
procurement were initiated, and I was in charge of

05:45.901 --> 06:05.689
riding herd on those contracts until I left the 
Bureau in October. The Bristol Company at

06:07.471 --> 06:10.255
Waterbury, Connecticut made the best ones and the 
first ones, although the patent was held by the

06:10.302 --> 06:21.510
Submarine Signal Company and it was necessary to 
buy 500 bathy thermographs from them. although

06:22.283 --> 06:30.672
they did very little of the actual technical parts 
of the instrument, just finishing the brass

06:22.283 --> 06:30.672
casings. But in that way, the patent costs and 
royalties were settled. And the Bristol Company

06:35.678 --> 06:45.649
put out the bathyr thermographs, which had been 
handmade up to that time by Allen Vine, Morris

06:35.678 --> 06:45.649
Ewing, and so on. If you will turn to a paper given In 
October 1970, at the Silver Jubilee of the

06:50.920 --> 07:09.984
Instrument Society of America, paper number 
735-70,

06:50.920 --> 07:09.984
The Mechanical Bathymograph and Historical 
Review, by B.K. Cooper and Eugene C. LaFond, a good

07:10.004 --> 07:18.835
part of the story of the early development of the 
instrument will be taken care of. This paper and

07:20.738 --> 07:38.106
Bennett's paper lay the background for a 
coincidence, a fortunate coincidence, on which

07:20.738 --> 07:38.106
the oceanographers have hung many a project. It 
was the fact that a Navy need, that is, something to

07:39.508 --> 07:46.780
help anti-submarine warfare, was met by a 
mechanical device that the scientists had

07:48.194 --> 07:59.626
developed to give an indication of the structure 
of the upper layers of the sea temperature-wise.

08:02.909 --> 08:12.919
This little piece of brass, which the scientists 
could give to a naval officer and say, this will

08:02.909 --> 08:12.919
help you in your war, opened the floodgates of 
funding and the Navy was able, through Beership's

08:13.928 --> 08:32.771
support, to carry out with the scientists the 
recommendations of the Coal Pits Committee that

08:13.928 --> 08:32.771
if the Navy wished to improve their 
anti-submarine warfare detection

08:13.928 --> 08:32.771
capabilities, they should learn all they could 
about the ocean. It was almost a carte blanche as

08:34.133 --> 08:38.318
far as projects were concerned. And during the 
patriotic periods of the war, People from all

08:43.882 --> 08:53.193
walks of life were dragged in or came in willingly 
to be a part of the big anti-submarine warfare

08:43.882 --> 08:53.193
effort. It is of interest that Lyman Spitzer, the 
well-known astronomer, for instance, wrote the

08:54.875 --> 09:06.329
first bathy thermograph instruction manual.

09:08.932 --> 09:12.336
Many famous names in other lines of biology 
geology, and other sciences today worked with the

09:13.058 --> 09:22.213
anti-submarine warfare group during the war 
wholeheartedly. And from their connection, as

09:23.335 --> 09:35.995
the years came on later, the oceanography devices 
and instruments of today developed as almost

09:23.335 --> 09:35.995
linear descendants of the work of these people. In 
addition to the fortunate coincidence of a need

09:38.540 --> 09:55.448
and an instrument to fill it, there came together, 
in November of 1942, Roger Revell from Scripps

09:38.540 --> 09:55.448
Institution of Oceanography and Rawson Bennett 
in the Bureau of Ships. Roger had direct orders to

09:57.010 --> 10:01.037
the Hydrographic Office. but with his usual 
wonderful ability to sense where the power lay, he

10:01.152 --> 10:09.984
had additional orders to the Bureau of Ships. And 
the old story is that he used to work all day in the

10:10.004 --> 10:30.231
Bureau of Ships, then go to the Cosmos Club, sit 
down with Mary Sears, who was a wave on duty at the

10:10.004 --> 10:30.231
Hydrographic Office as a lieutenant commander, 
and he would lay out for her the work that should be

10:10.004 --> 10:30.231
done in the charting and the hydrographic areas 
and the study of hydrographic stations at

10:30.582 --> 10:48.207
hydrographic office and at 11 o'clock after 
supper and with her instructions she would go home

10:30.582 --> 10:48.207
to carry out his part of the work at the 
hydrographic office until the next meeting. It

10:48.227 --> 10:51.392
was a labor of love on both parts and worked 
beautifully. Roger's immense grasp of the

10:52.604 --> 11:14.916
situation, both for anti-submarine warfare and 
his innate talent for being able to tell a naval

10:52.604 --> 11:14.916
officer the kinds of work a scientist could do for 
him to help him, plus the fact that Rawson Bennett

10:52.604 --> 11:14.916
was a graduate not only of the Naval Academy, but 
also of the University of California and could

11:15.267 --> 11:25.920
talk to a scientist in mathematical terms on his 
own level made it a very wonderful combination.

11:26.841 --> 11:37.694
And this combination, in general, held right 
straight on through Bikini when Roger left Joint

11:26.841 --> 11:37.694
Task Force One to return to Scripps. It must be 
remembered that a war was going on, ships were

11:41.339 --> 11:54.732
being sunk off the coast at the rate of four and five 
a night, and the scientists as well as the naval

11:41.339 --> 11:54.732
officers had one aim in common. This did not, 
however, prevent fundamental research from

11:54.752 --> 12:00.297
going on to accomplish that problem. There used to 
be, in the old days of the Navy contracts, a clause

12:01.499 --> 12:08.005
which permitted the person at work to go back as far 
as necessary in fundamentals to attain what was

12:08.069 --> 12:15.159
needed. And if there was no fundamental, he could 
go back and try to establish it. And on this general

12:23.651 --> 12:32.243
principle hung a great deal of the basic research 
that was difficult for the naval people later on to

12:23.651 --> 12:32.243
understand. But during the war, it was all The 
scientists were serving human purposes, just

12:35.947 --> 12:50.421
like Spitzer did in writing that manual, far below 
their capabilities in one sense, but were getting

12:35.947 --> 12:50.421
a broadened outlook as to what could be done. And 
the money was carried on. It even carried on after

12:54.364 --> 13:04.654
the letdown, after World War II, because then came 
Korea, and again the gates were opened, for

13:05.005 --> 13:06.227
additional funding. And it was only far later on 
when the Mayfield Amendment came up in which they

13:07.288 --> 13:23.970
said everything had to be relevant to a stated Navy 
need that the then operating Office of Research

13:07.288 --> 13:23.970
had to begin to curtail its activities. It is 
interesting to note and sometimes not so amusing

13:25.432 --> 13:34.084
to the Office of Naval Research people than whom 
there are no finer and to whom all honor should be

13:34.553 --> 13:59.245
due for the research that has gone on in the ocean, 
that the Bureau of Ships preceded the Office of

13:34.553 --> 13:59.245
Naval Research in the general area and did the 
funding of the contracts which the Office of Naval

13:34.553 --> 13:59.245
Research later took over with Scripps, with Woods 
Hole, and with Lamont Geological Observatory,

13:34.553 --> 13:59.245
Columbia University, and so on. It irks the ONR 
people when I say, from beer ships, before ONR, we

14:00.828 --> 14:07.484
are. But to some extent, and to a large extent, in 
fact, during the war, it was absolutely true.

14:15.830 --> 14:24.743
former assistant secretary of the Navy, has given 
a charming description in one of his papers of the

14:15.830 --> 14:24.743
formation of ONR and has a lieutenant commander. 
He thought there should be an assistant secretary

14:25.084 --> 14:34.518
of the Navy for research, which came about with him 
as a first incumbent after the war.

14:37.703 --> 14:43.592
But going back again, it was the coincidence of two 
brains, Ravel and Bennett, who could talk to each

14:44.230 --> 14:52.478
other, Bennett, who could give him the official 
go-ahead, and the wherewithal, Roger, who could

14:44.230 --> 14:52.478
see the need and apply it. Believe it or not, out of 
that section came such things as the only really

14:53.919 --> 15:13.697
good defense against the kamikaze, and that were 
the smoke pots that Roger had installed on the rear

14:53.919 --> 15:13.697
of the ships, which could, under certain wind 
conditions, could obscure the ship and help

14:53.919 --> 15:13.697
divert the aim of the terrible kamikaze. That was 
just one thing out of the realm of oceanography

15:16.933 --> 15:20.639
that he was interested in. And the scope of his 
interest ran from the bottom of the ocean to the top

15:20.699 --> 15:27.011
of space. And he was as much in meteorology as he was 
in oceanography in certain phases. Another group

15:34.383 --> 15:47.745
that must be given their proper place are the 30 
engines that were trained at Woods Hole, given one

15:34.383 --> 15:47.745
bath of thermograph, a spool of wire, and a little 
winch, and sent out to teach the admirals about

15:34.383 --> 15:47.745
oceanography. Well, it didn't work very often, 
and these boys were often and always incorporated

15:48.646 --> 15:55.277
into the ship's company. And because they were 
good officers, they made splendid records. One of

15:59.119 --> 16:00.681
them received the Navy Cross. Many died, several 
died in the line of duty. And their record is second

16:05.446 --> 16:09.670
to none as a group. They did teach a great many naval 
officers at least how to say bathymograph and

16:09.691 --> 16:15.297
oceanography.

16:19.982 --> 16:24.707
Union's development of the submarine 
bathymograph, as recorded in the paper, and from

16:25.261 --> 16:36.556
his own write-up of it, was the most important 
thing in that there was a positive use that could be

16:25.261 --> 16:36.556
made rather than an interpretation after the 
fact. There was a positive use that could be made of

16:36.796 --> 16:44.546
the instrument, and it was made by the 
submariners, and it was welcomed by a great many of

16:36.796 --> 16:44.546
them.

16:47.470 --> 16:49.733
In the Pacific, at least, the success of the of the 
program, which was carried out personally by Alan

16:51.029 --> 17:18.977
Vine at the submarine headquarters at Pearl 
Harbor, was that Joe Grenfell, later Vice Admiral

16:51.029 --> 17:18.977
Grenfell, who at that time was operations officer 
for Submarines Pacific under Admiral Lockwood,

16:51.029 --> 17:18.977
Joe Grenfell would put on his summary of the cruise 
report of the returning submarines a little

16:51.029 --> 17:18.977
phrase like, The use of the Bathy thermograph was 
noted with approval, which made all the submarine

17:19.902 --> 17:33.137
skippers who got copies of their brothers' 
reports see what is this instrument and treat it

17:19.902 --> 17:33.137
with much more respect. Little things of this kind 
were important in those days where things were

17:34.819 --> 17:42.348
coming so fast. Among the people who were 
important in the Pacific was Captain T.W. Rogers,

17:48.284 --> 18:12.707
now retired, at Kanawha Street in Washington, 
D.C., who was in charge of the Special Electronics

17:48.284 --> 18:12.707
Section of the Maintenance

17:48.284 --> 18:12.707
Correction, who was in charge of the Electronics 
Division of the Service Force Pacific Fleet, his

17:48.284 --> 18:12.707
special job being to personally, with his 
assistance, approve the installation of

18:12.890 --> 18:22.380
electronic equipment so that the fighting ships 
got their equipment first rather than having it

18:12.890 --> 18:22.380
wasted on coastal vessels. Under him, I went out as 
a specialist officer in charge of the BT

18:24.022 --> 18:37.557
installation program in the Pacific and was given 
charge of about six officers on the ships in the

18:24.022 --> 18:37.557
Pacific fleet. These men worked all the way from 
Alaska to Australia and as I mentioned, were Woods

18:43.720 --> 18:49.870
Hole train engines and they did a superb job.

18:52.855 --> 19:09.441
I stayed on in the Navy one more year until 1946 and 
was able to assist in the preparations and the

18:52.855 --> 19:09.441
passage of the oceanographers and the baggage and 
all of that group on their way to Bikini for the

18:52.855 --> 19:09.441
great atom bomb test. was one important point in 
connection with the procurement of bathy

19:11.294 --> 19:41.233
thermographs in any quantity it was not 
considered by the navy to be a scientific

19:11.294 --> 19:41.233
instrument it was considered to be a component 
that is a part a necessary part of a sonar equipment

19:11.294 --> 19:41.233
just as a light bulb would be to do a particular 
function and on that basis mass procurement was

19:11.294 --> 19:41.233
possible and of course after the war these Those 
that were left over were used for scientific

19:41.872 --> 19:44.875
purposes. And during the war, as you can see if you 
turn to the back of the Bathie Thermograph paper,

19:45.716 --> 19:56.065
you could almost plot the progress of the war by the 
Bathie Thermograph observations. There was one I

19:57.146 --> 19:59.769
was very proud to see later at Scripps. It was 500 
miles from Tokyo, and it was in 1942. And it was on

20:05.494 --> 20:11.440
one of the ships of Doolittle's Tokyo raid.

20:14.542 --> 20:26.645
But however you make a distinction between a 
useful tool and an instrument,

20:14.542 --> 20:26.645
the distinction was important to the 
oceanographers. And as time went on after 1948,

20:27.787 --> 20:32.095
the more basic part of the research and 
development was taken over by the Office of Naval

20:32.446 --> 20:49.105
Research and the applied research on which we 
could at least foresee a Navy payoff was kept in the

20:32.446 --> 20:49.105
Bureau of Ships where possible.

20:51.968 --> 21:00.138
I've always thought the Bureau of Ships should 
have kept the Marine Physical Laboratory at La

20:51.968 --> 21:00.138
Jolla. It was set up by Bennett and his Admiral at 
that time in order that there should be a feed

21:02.348 --> 21:12.762
direct to the bureauships of the scientific minds 
of the community. On that basis, three professors

21:13.643 --> 21:19.591
were paid by the University of California, not the 
Navy. They were Carl Eckert, Russell Raitt, and

21:20.332 --> 21:25.659
Leonard Lieberman. These were four professors of 
the University of California. Yet they were

21:31.019 --> 21:42.113
assigned to the Marine Physical Laboratory, for 
which the facilities and the operation and the

21:31.019 --> 21:42.113
equipment were furnished by the Navy. And they 
were stationed deliberately on the grounds of the

21:43.855 --> 21:56.791
then Electronics Laboratory, Navy Electronics 
Laboratory at Point Loma, for this close

21:43.855 --> 21:56.791
collaboration in electronics and in instrument 
development. When the Office of Naval Research

21:57.913 --> 21:59.895
took it over, They were probably on more basic 
programs. But at the same time, the information

22:05.469 --> 22:11.317
had to be filtered through one more agency before 
it got to the Bureau of Ships. However, the way at

22:12.058 --> 22:29.342
that time that this was done, about 1950, was to 
move the instrument groups and the hardware

22:12.058 --> 22:29.342
groups, as the Navy liked to call them,

22:29.947 --> 22:36.393
to the bureauships and the theoreticians and the 
research groups to ONR. I have no real quarrel with

22:37.334 --> 22:42.739
that decision, though I hate to see MPL leave the 
bureauships. So the bureauships program

22:43.580 --> 22:59.194
gradually dwindled on down until it became about a 
$3 million, $3 to $4 million program, but at its

22:43.580 --> 22:59.194
best perhaps in many ways because the Navy 
laboratories themselves under that program were

23:00.018 --> 23:08.309
given a measure of freedom for basic research, 
sometimes equal to that which the Naval Research

23:00.018 --> 23:08.309
Laboratory itself could provide. I used to argue 
with the naval officers and the appropriation

23:09.651 --> 23:23.530
persons that under any contract, at least 30% of 
the funds should go for basic research to support

23:09.651 --> 23:23.530
the projects which were named in hardware. And 
they were very generous most of the time. Also, by

23:28.182 --> 23:56.738
taking advantage of funds that had been unused by 
different departments and the bureauships, in

23:28.182 --> 23:56.738
the early days it was possible to get chunks of 
money from the oceanographers at the Navy

23:28.182 --> 23:56.738
laboratories because we could say it was ready to 
be spent at any time, whereas if you had to go out to a

23:28.182 --> 23:56.738
contractor, we would not be able to appropriate to 
contract the money to be spent within the time

23:28.182 --> 23:56.738
limit before the appropriation ran out. It was 
always enjoyable to see the way that the people at

23:58.304 --> 24:06.855
the Navy Electronics Laboratory Oceanographic 
Section in those days used such chunks of money.

24:08.056 --> 24:13.943
Out of such things came the Oceanographic Tower 
and many, many things of that kind. And Dr. LaFond,

24:14.003 --> 24:25.037
Bob Dietz, Bob Dill, Ed Hamilton, many, many more 
deserve all kinds of credit. for the good use and

24:25.473 --> 24:29.739
imaginative use to which they put that work. I'm 
very proud of the program that the Bureau of Ships

24:30.640 --> 24:35.407
had, and we can discuss that later. Now let's go 
back to World War II, and let me play for you the

24:36.148 --> 24:47.404
words as I read them from the book, which you can 
find yourself if you wish to go into it further.

24:48.105 --> 24:54.113
Remember, the Bureau of Ships was a material 
crowd, not a research crowd, and yet you will read

24:48.105 --> 24:54.113
through it all that a great many new and wonderful 
things were being discovered because of the

24:54.548 --> 25:04.987
sincere effort and unrestrained effort of minds 
from all walks of life. So here is the recording.

25:07.732 --> 25:16.928
Research

25:07.732 --> 25:16.928
and Development during World War II, the 
introductory paragraph, quote. When surveying

25:18.055 --> 25:34.542
the fundamental reasons for the Allied victory in 
World War II, World War II, Volume 4, Library

25:18.055 --> 25:34.542
Stack, WEMU, colon, S557, Volume 4. Beginning on 
page 127, Research and Development During World

25:35.784 --> 25:43.978
War II, the introductory paragraph, quote, When 
surveying the fundamental reasons for the Allied

25:45.005 --> 26:06.731
victory in World War II, naval historians and 
officers of the line conclude alike and without

25:45.005 --> 26:06.731
qualification that the research and development 
program carried out under the U.S. Navy's

25:45.005 --> 26:06.731
jurisdiction proved to be unsurpassed by any 
other one single factor in contributing to our

25:45.005 --> 26:06.731
operational successes. Now going over to page 
130, the beginning of a report

26:12.983 --> 26:18.753
Commander-in-Chief, U.S. Fleet to the Secretary 
of Navy, dated 8 December 1945. Several

26:19.714 --> 26:20.756
paragraphs. The first, quote, In December 1941, 
the United States faced seasoned enemies who not

26:21.157 --> 26:33.017
only had long been preparing for war, but who had 
actually been waging it for several years. Within

26:33.183 --> 26:47.726
the limited facilities and means available 
throughout the years of peace, the United States

26:33.183 --> 26:47.726
Navy had, however, equipped itself with weapons 
the equal of or superior to those of other navies,

26:33.183 --> 26:47.726
and had laid the groundwork for still further 
development. During the war, the science and

26:48.528 --> 27:00.507
industry of this country and our allies was 
mobilized to apply existing scientific

26:48.528 --> 27:00.507
knowledge to the perfection of these weapons and 
the development of new and more deadly means of

26:48.528 --> 27:00.507
waging war. As a result, the United States Navy was 
able to maintain the technical advantage over the

27:00.858 --> 27:10.311
navies of our enemies, which contributed so 
materially to the outcome of World War II. Page

27:12.754 --> 27:13.535
131. The means of accomplishing this were not so 
much directed toward making new discoveries as

27:14.576 --> 27:25.491
toward the exploitation of the skills and 
techniques which civilian scientists had

27:14.576 --> 27:25.491
already cultivated in years of peace. When war 
appeared imminent, The War and Navy departments

27:27.858 --> 27:38.134
and the National Academy of Sciences gave close 
attention to the most profitable manner of

27:27.858 --> 27:38.134
utilizing the strength of American science in 
military and naval research. It was decided to

27:38.995 --> 27:55.941
attempt a solution involving the maximum 
flexibility and initiative, in which the

27:38.995 --> 27:55.941
fundamental principle would be cooperation 
between science and the armed forces, rather than

27:38.995 --> 27:55.941
to bring the scientists into military and naval 
laboratories, as was done in England. The

27:55.921 --> 27:57.825
principle proved thoroughly sound. The 
arrangements adopted was the establishment by

27:58.446 --> 28:16.140
executive order of the Office of Scientific 
Research and Development, which has as its

27:58.446 --> 28:16.140
scientific and technical working bodies the 
National Defense Research Council, the Medical

27:58.446 --> 28:16.140
Research Council, and later the Office of Field 
Service. To assure full integration of the

28:16.576 --> 28:30.352
potentialities of these organizations with the 
Navy's own research and development program and

28:16.576 --> 28:30.352
the needs of the service, the late Secretary Knox, 
in July 1941, established the Office of

28:16.576 --> 28:30.352
Coordinator of Research and Development. 
Throughout the war, the development of new

28:30.993 --> 28:41.385
weapons and devices has been accelerated by the 
teamwork between the users, the scientists, the

28:30.993 --> 28:41.385
engineer designers, and the producers. The 
devices and weapons resulting from the research

28:43.120 --> 28:49.427
and development program have been put to use in 
every phase of naval warfare. Particular

28:50.088 --> 29:00.620
examples cited because of their complexity and 
diversification are amphibious warfare,

28:50.088 --> 29:00.620
carrier warfare, submarine and anti-submarine 
warfare. In each of these cases, our combat

29:01.401 --> 29:11.592
effectiveness has been materially increased by 
improvements in communications, navigational

29:01.401 --> 29:11.592
devices, fire control, detection equipment, 
firepower, aircraft performance, range, speed,

29:11.723 --> 29:20.029
armament, handling characteristics, and by 
advanced training and methods and equipment.

29:20.887 --> 29:33.749
Perhaps the greatest technological advances of 
the entire war have been made in the field of

29:20.887 --> 29:33.749
electronics , both within the naval laboratories 
and in collaboration with the Office of

29:20.887 --> 29:33.749
Scientific Research and Development. The 
pre-existing radar sets were developed and new

29:34.611 --> 29:42.304
models created for ship and airborne search, fire 
control, and for accurate long-range

29:34.611 --> 29:42.304
navigation. Identification recognition 
equipment were developed for use in conjunction

29:42.284 --> 29:46.888
with radar systems. New and highly efficient 
short-range radio telephones were used for

29:47.889 --> 29:53.415
tactical communication. In the successful 
anti-submarine campaign in the Atlantic, small

29:53.435 --> 29:58.660
radio sonobuoys were used. These, when dropped 
from aircraft, listened for the noise made by a

29:59.220 --> 30:07.709
submarine and automatically relayed the 
information to the searching plane. Great

30:08.469 --> 30:12.173
strides have been made in electronic 
anti-submarine detection equipment.

30:12.592 --> 30:19.382
Underwater echo ranging gear and listening 
equipment have been improved in quality and

30:12.592 --> 30:19.382
extended in function since the outbreak of the 
war. Countermeasures have been developed for

30:20.123 --> 30:32.220
jamming enemy radar and communication systems, 
disrupting the control of signals for his guided

30:20.123 --> 30:32.220
missiles and counteracting his measures to jam 
our own equipment.

30:36.959 --> 30:37.800
New paragraph. The late war, more than any other, 
involved the interplay of new and technical

30:38.021 --> 30:44.070
measures and opposing countermeasures. For 
example, the German U-boats had to revise their

30:44.330 --> 30:55.867
tactics and equipment when we began to use radar on 
our anti-submarine aircraft, and we in turn had to

30:44.330 --> 30:55.867
modify our tactics and radar equipment to counter 
their changes.

30:58.672 --> 31:01.516
Let it run out to the end and then turn over this 
tape. Let it run out to the end, then turn over this

31:02.758 --> 31:06.223
tape. We're about at the end now.

31:15.143 --> 31:15.825
Almost there.
