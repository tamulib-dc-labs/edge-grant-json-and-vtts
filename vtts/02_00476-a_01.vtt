WEBVTT

00:02.596 --> 00:31.624
subject when Abramowitz was turned down by the 
Malaysians the other day they refused him as

00:02.596 --> 00:31.624
ambassador down there this subject came up about 
somebody had said that he was and Carter he had been

00:02.596 --> 00:31.624
the instigator of Carter's withdrawal from Korea 
and the press was trying to just somebody trying to

00:02.596 --> 00:31.624
deny it but somebody doesn't know what the hell is 
going on all they got to go back and read the

00:32.043 --> 00:43.715
testimony before the Senate Armed Services 
Committee when General Vesey and I testified for

00:32.043 --> 00:43.715
those troops staying there and Bromwich 
testified against it. So, I know what the hell I'm

00:45.937 --> 00:50.422
talking about. Okay. You left Korea in 1976. And 
then you had your last assignment. Tell me about

01:00.233 --> 01:08.264
that special assistant to the CSA in which you did 
the Hollingsworth Report Central Europe

01:00.233 --> 01:08.264
Assessment. That came about as a result of me 
developing a new strategy for the defense of

01:08.284 --> 01:14.872
Northeast Asia and Korea. And it came about as a 
result of Senator Sam Nunn's interest in NATO

01:16.494 --> 01:25.506
Central Europe.

01:25.942 --> 01:32.810
and as a result of his visits over there and the 
inadequacies that he could see as a senator. So he

01:34.873 --> 01:46.968
asked the Secretary of the Army and the Secretary 
of Defense to, uh, I came back to retire and I went to

01:34.873 --> 01:46.968
Sam Houston, Fort Sam Houston. Really? Yes. At 
this time you were, you were, you came back to

01:48.630 --> 01:52.334
retire? To retire, yes. Did you want to retire? Oh, 
it didn't make any difference to me. I got to where I

01:56.839 --> 01:59.802
couldn't hardly see out of it with one eye anyway. 
And I was getting a little tired.

02:05.408 --> 02:09.052
But no, you know, I never have retired. I haven't 
retired yet. But you really, you were not, you

02:11.374 --> 02:14.617
weren't interested. I went on television by 
satellite for today's show and told them it had

02:14.637 --> 02:21.885
been decided that by my government that I would 
retire and that's what I was going to do. What told

02:27.792 --> 02:29.896
you about your retirement? The Chief of Staff of 
the Army asked for my retirement. Oh, he asked for

02:33.020 --> 02:34.062
it? Oh, yeah. You know, he didn't have any other 
assignment for me after I finished over there. You

02:39.430 --> 02:41.393
see, three and four stars are This is an interview 
with General Hill in Abilene and today is the 20th

02:42.200 --> 02:48.909
of August, 1982. Let's start out, sir, by getting a 
little bit of background information for the

02:50.050 --> 02:56.339
record. Could you tell us where and when you were 
born? Well, I have a little clipping that'll, out

03:00.805 --> 03:10.858
of the 1967 Who's Who. Okay, good. that'll 
simplify that for you.

03:19.661 --> 03:24.045
I'll go get that right now and hand it to you and put 
it in your file. Oh, great.

03:29.931 --> 03:38.599
Before we go on, I'd like to ask you if you would 
donate your information that will be on this tape

03:29.931 --> 03:38.599
to Texas A&M University. Well, what are you going 
to do with it? Copy write it? No, we're going to put

03:43.742 --> 03:46.625
it in our archives and we're going to leave it 
there. And we're going to give you a copy. Okay.

03:50.090 --> 03:54.215
Good, because we'd like to make sure that it's all 
donated to us. Could you tell us a little bit about

03:54.235 --> 03:57.359
your parents? Yes, my father was a staunch pillar 
of the Baptist Church in El Dorado, Texas,

03:58.720 --> 04:08.873
Schleicher County. And I think he sold every 
windmill in that county.

04:19.724 --> 04:39.012
And tons of barbed wire for fencing in the ranches 
that were

04:19.724 --> 04:39.012
going out of stock raising and taking a fling at 
farming.

04:41.219 --> 04:48.169
That town is about 48 miles south of San Angelo. On 
the old wagon road, it was 52 miles. And it took the

04:55.058 --> 05:03.570
Model T Ford a long time to replace

04:55.058 --> 05:03.570
the wagons.

05:06.494 --> 05:11.040
And

05:06.494 --> 05:11.040
we... Actually the wagons weren't replaced until 
they got the hard surface road immediately after

05:12.809 --> 05:37.129
World War I.

05:12.809 --> 05:37.129
I think that stripped from San Angelo down to the 
Sonora and later, much later, on down to Del Rio.

05:38.948 --> 05:55.526
That was a high dry country and they didn't know 
much about hard surface roads, but they decided to

05:38.948 --> 05:55.526
experiment out there where they had a good caliche 
base and dry weather. And I think the first fifty

05:57.629 --> 06:07.099
miles of hard surface road was from San Angelo to El 
Dorado And the engineer that bossed the thing and

06:08.581 --> 06:25.276
proposed the idea and got the estate to back it was 
the county engineer for Tom Green County, San

06:08.581 --> 06:25.276
Angelo.

06:28.179 --> 06:36.207
So, that was when automobile traffic really came 
and truck traffic. Sure. fully displaced the

06:37.623 --> 06:40.287
animal-drawn vehicles. Can you tell me something 
about your mother? She was

06:45.454 --> 07:05.503
quite active in the Eastern Star, and she went to 
the Baptist church with my father, but oddly

06:45.454 --> 07:05.503
enough never joined the church.

07:06.715 --> 07:15.004
sectarian branch of the Christian church that her 
father had belonged to. So that was her one stand on

07:15.024 --> 07:21.210
independence.

07:25.895 --> 07:28.398
Was your family pretty religious then? Not 
particularly. Not particularly?

07:35.622 --> 07:41.367
It took rather—yeah, I'll stand on that 
statement, not particularly. You said your

07:41.707 --> 07:44.029
father was a staunch Baptist? Baptist. But not 
particularly religious? He was staunch and a

07:49.775 --> 08:00.564
leader in the church and donated, I think, more 
than a tenth. He tithed. But I don't know how much of

08:05.288 --> 08:18.059
it was good business among his customers and how 
much of it was greed for more guilt.

08:20.201 --> 08:22.463
What was the authority in the household?

08:24.985 --> 08:26.987
It was pretty well a joint command. Oh, a joint 
command. Yeah.

08:33.312 --> 08:34.333
Very much so. Now you've had a very successful 
career not only as a general officer but in the

08:36.693 --> 08:44.983
university world. What credit do you give your 
parents for that? Well,

08:51.451 --> 09:05.147
in the first place,

08:51.451 --> 09:05.147
my father was a vast reader. He had no degree. I

09:11.600 --> 09:28.386
think he had what would be considered in his day a 
first-class prep school education and a private

09:11.600 --> 09:28.386
school down close to Houston. And that education 
was provided pretty much by one of his older

09:35.873 --> 09:42.919
brothers.

09:42.999 --> 09:50.526
He

09:42.999 --> 09:50.526
got a good foundation. He learned to read and read 
for fun. And the novel was

09:57.512 --> 10:05.239
having its early impact on American history. 
literature and even to the point that some of the

10:05.658 --> 10:15.594
churches were preaching against it as ungodly and 
whatnot.

10:18.919 --> 10:20.201
But he went in for reading. He read anything that he 
could get his whole hands on. And he had the largest

10:27.232 --> 10:33.522
library, by the way, in El Dorado. He had more books 
in his library than they had in the high school. But

10:40.985 --> 11:01.753
that's not a big boast because the high school had 
its library largely consisted of an unabridged

10:40.985 --> 11:01.753
dictionary, a fairly recent set of the 
encyclopedia, and sundry books that teachers had

11:02.037 --> 11:07.524
taken away from the students because they were 
reading the book instead of reading their

11:02.037 --> 11:07.524
lessons.

11:10.468 --> 11:29.513
In other words, there were less than 50 or 60 books 
in the high school library, but our house, the

11:10.468 --> 11:29.513
front room, had a wall and bookcases, had a wall of 
books. So you always read a lot then? Yeah.

11:39.901 --> 11:42.465
He was an avid reader. And he had an old Chambers 
encyclopedia, an English edition. I don't know

11:53.040 --> 12:00.090
where it came from, but if anything came up that he 
didn't quite understand, He'd got down that

12:00.998 --> 12:09.209
10-volume encyclopedia, I think it was dated 
about 1876. And he'd look up the details and get

12:09.229 --> 12:16.739
himself on the track. He was a remarkable man. He 
was born in 1862 in the

12:19.783 --> 12:27.833
middle of the Civil War. He had three brothers in 
the Confederate Army. His father was a member of

12:33.853 --> 12:45.189
the legislature of Alabama through the four years 
of the war. His father, I think, was elected to the

12:47.051 --> 12:52.559
secession convention that took him out of the 
Union. I think he served, that was a convention, I

12:53.841 --> 12:57.786
think. but he was in the legislature either as a 
lower house or the upper house. Four years, I think

13:08.113 --> 13:12.340
he was two years in the lower house and two years in 
the upper house. My father was born in 62 and had a

13:13.141 --> 13:21.895
very hard life.

13:24.038 --> 13:25.140
His father was a small business man in Jasper, 
Alabama. And during Reconstruction in Alabama,

13:32.361 --> 13:55.212
he had to leave, and he left for

13:32.361 --> 13:55.212
New Orleans, for Louisiana, and he was also a lay 
preacher. preach for nothing for country

13:56.120 --> 14:08.113
churches that had no pulpit, no regular, that 
might not have money enough to hire a permanent

13:56.120 --> 14:08.113
preacher. But as a businessman in Jasper, he would 
go out and do that, and I think that's what got him in

14:09.435 --> 14:17.423
politics. And he became head of an orphan's home in 
Louisiana, held that job for a while, and he

14:25.904 --> 14:40.760
decided to turn to paid preaching as a way of life. 
Well, pretty soon he had to leave Louisiana in the

14:42.241 --> 14:55.455
Reconstruction days, and he and his boys and 
family moved to Texas in the Houston area. down

14:56.465 --> 15:12.766
around a little town named Grapeland, down in, 
I've never been in it,

14:56.465 --> 15:12.766
down around close to Houston, the city of Houston.

15:13.988 --> 15:24.902
And that's where he got a pretty good education, 
was in that, in a private school

15:13.988 --> 15:24.902
down there.

15:27.818 --> 15:38.514
He took a business college course on bookkeeping 
and spin Syrian handwriting and bookkeeping. No

15:39.555 --> 15:43.220
typewriters in his day. So

15:44.582 --> 15:49.830
that was from Tyler, Texas. They gave him a diploma 
about the size of the wall there. with a lot of

15:57.046 --> 15:59.349
script on him and so forth. And that's the only 
thing I ever saw that evidence of education.

16:07.221 --> 16:08.783
But he was an educated man. Can you tell me 
something about your education? Well, it's

16:14.090 --> 16:15.733
rather conventional.

16:18.136 --> 16:23.003
One year at A&M,

16:23.185 --> 16:29.153
Tell me a little bit about your primary and 
secondary education first before we get to A&M.

16:29.914 --> 16:51.522
Well, the high school,

16:29.914 --> 16:51.522
the high schools in those days were making the 
transition from the conventional ten grades

16:29.914 --> 16:51.522
between the first grade and the graduation and 
the—they

16:52.295 --> 17:21.171
were making the conventional—

16:52.295 --> 17:21.171
When a guy had been through ten grades in a town of, 
let us say, two thousand, he was educated. and he

17:23.176 --> 17:29.765
could then go usually quite often. At that stage 
they did go to business colleges or they took

17:29.785 --> 17:39.359
longer

17:29.785 --> 17:39.359
courses. Now the big cities

17:39.439 --> 17:52.457
at that period were experimenting with the 
eleventh grade or introducing the eleventh grade

17:39.439 --> 17:52.457
and advancing the of knowledge to more difficult 
subjects, such as algebra, to quadratic

17:53.686 --> 18:03.701
equations. When you got to quadratic equations, 
which was in the middle of the book, that was

18:04.943 --> 18:10.811
enough. They could pick it up later.

18:16.740 --> 18:20.706
But algebra was unheard of.

18:21.732 --> 18:25.656
until I think they brought in the eleventh grade. 
At least I never heard of it. So did you finish the

18:27.538 --> 18:31.702
tenth grade and then start off at A&M? Yeah. A&M had 
a— Why'd you decide to go to A&M? Well, they put in

18:36.187 --> 18:49.360
a—the city schools were putting city schools the 
size of, well, pounds ten or twelve thousand

18:51.044 --> 19:04.539
working cities in those days, nineteen, ten, 
eleven, twelve, thirteen, fourteen, fifteen,

18:51.044 --> 19:04.539
sixteen.

19:08.423 --> 19:18.334
The

19:08.423 --> 19:18.334
big cities were already putting

19:08.423 --> 19:18.334
in the twelfth grade But these smaller cities, 
like San Angelo, were saying, we want to

19:19.647 --> 19:33.601
experiment with the eleventh grade before we get 
into this stuff, because teachers of these

19:19.647 --> 19:33.601
advanced subjects were scarce. Yeah, I would 
think so. And incidentally, most of the

19:38.566 --> 19:44.972
mathematics teachers were getting, were being 
found in technical schools. Most high schools had

19:50.123 --> 19:58.831
two or three A&M students in it, usually teaching 
mathematics and very elementary science.

20:03.295 --> 20:05.496
The teachers' colleges weren't in that business. 
They were normal schools. Particularly, it was

20:08.479 --> 20:11.342
reading, writing, arithmetic. And as the tune 
went, talked to the tune of a head Chris Tick,

20:22.658 --> 20:49.543
A&M was admitting people with a tenth grade 
diploma if he showed enough mental confidence to

20:22.658 --> 20:49.543
make a passing grade on a second class teacher's 
certificate. Now in those days they had first

20:51.228 --> 21:01.559
class teacher certificates that you could teach 
any subject anywhere in the state. An easier

21:04.021 --> 21:16.054
examination that I think stopped short of algebra 
or quadratics.

21:21.080 --> 21:25.025
It was easier subject and so forth. And anybody, it 
was pitched to entitle a person to get a job

21:25.947 --> 21:41.007
teaching anything under the grammar school 
level. In other words, the ninth grade or eighth

21:42.029 --> 21:46.194
grade, something like that. So you took that 
examination? Texas A&M said anybody that

21:48.367 --> 22:16.382
could pass that second grade examination, a 
second class

21:48.367 --> 22:16.382
examination, would be admitted on probation.

22:17.695 --> 22:45.306
I took the examination largely because the high 
school superintendent said that anybody that

22:17.695 --> 22:45.306
graduated had to show competence to teach past 
the—had to show enough—in other words, it was a

22:17.695 --> 22:45.306
comprehensive examination that he used and made 
it official by having the certificate issued. It

22:49.698 --> 22:51.560
was his qualifier. So that was, I had the 
certificate. And so I was admitted in the middle of

22:57.127 --> 23:04.016
the year. I think I got down there in late February.

23:09.343 --> 23:10.785
February of 1917 or 1916? I think 1970, yeah, 1970.

23:17.365 --> 23:42.901
And then that summer I got a job as a state driver and 
chain man on a survey team of the

23:17.365 --> 23:42.901
old railroad out of Fort Worth, Fort Worth and 
Denver. I think the Burlington owns it now. on the

23:48.668 --> 24:17.410
old Fort Worth and Denver and

23:48.668 --> 24:17.410
by that time World War II, World War I had erupted 
and the National Guard was already on the border or

23:48.668 --> 24:17.410
on the way home and those that were on the way home 
were immediately It called active duty. And

24:21.802 --> 24:27.948
everybody was volunteering here and 
volunteering there. The entire senior class down

24:27.968 --> 24:36.617
there, I think, volunteered for the Officer 
Candidate School at Leon Springs. The enrollment

24:38.359 --> 24:44.405
shrank from about 2,000 to the following year. I 
don't think they had more than about the following

24:48.524 --> 25:00.782
Fall, I think they had about, got down to the second 
semester, about 1,300.

25:01.062 --> 25:18.227
And

25:01.062 --> 25:18.227
the upperclassmen were all, if a guy was over 21 
years of age, he was going to an officer candidate

25:01.062 --> 25:18.227
school. Well, I wasn't old enough to go to an 
officer candidate school. So it looked like the

25:24.823 --> 25:34.735
campus, this is at the end of the first semester of 
1917, 18.

25:35.476 --> 25:40.742
It looked like the place was going to be deserted. 
So I had a friend, to be frank about it, I didn't

25:48.464 --> 26:10.034
forge my father's name to a telegram, but I

25:48.464 --> 26:10.034
managed to get a telegram anti-Britain

25:48.464 --> 26:10.034
on the stationery that the incoming messages were 
on. It would pass muster. Well, that telegram gave

26:12.036 --> 26:16.142
me permission to withdraw from college. and 
enlist in the Navy. And so that sprung me. I guess

26:28.900 --> 26:39.612
the, I've forgotten the date of my enlistment, but 
it was about Christmas time in 1918. Christmas

26:40.253 --> 26:42.315
time in 1917. Christmas time 1917 is right, 1918 
coming up. I think that's, now of course in the

26:49.411 --> 27:01.869
Navy, the Navy took the Armistice Day for what it 
really was. They said if the Army, if you won the war

27:03.391 --> 27:07.797
on the ground, okay. You've made the Germans 
surrender all of their artillery and ammunition

27:08.705 --> 27:19.297
and go back to the armistice line and demobilize 
the army. That's the great victory. You've won the

27:22.900 --> 27:24.002
victory. We in the Navy can't build ships fast 
enough if these bastards decide to renew the war on

27:25.683 --> 27:36.315
some technicality. We will begin giving 
discharges to those who

27:37.898 --> 27:54.796
enlisted after the war began, after the 
declaration war. He says we will begin

27:54.816 --> 28:03.906
demobilizing them as soon As we know, the peace 
treaty is signed. Well, the peace treaty wasn't

28:10.330 --> 28:17.902
signed until 1990.

28:19.264 --> 28:21.187
Long about the middle of July.

28:23.811 --> 28:26.936
The ship I was on was a destroyer. I was a seaman 
signalman. Where were you stationed? I was on the

28:33.974 --> 28:43.465
Destroy Your Hearty, which is a thirty-knot, 
four-piper, crew of a hundred and twenty. And we

28:45.187 --> 28:58.082
were, when the war ended, as I remember it, we were 
on the Azores patrol or something like that. Did

28:58.102 --> 28:59.224
you see any action? No.

29:05.682 --> 29:06.203
No. A

29:06.303 --> 29:22.902
distant whale with a good spouter could easily be 
mistaken for a submarine periscope.

29:26.687 --> 29:28.309
Nobody had shot a gun lately. No, we did a lot of 
patrolling. I'll say this for those destroyers,

29:35.146 --> 29:41.495
you learn seamanship often. You just don't, you 
either become a seaman or something happens

29:41.515 --> 29:53.253
to you. Well, to make a long story short,

29:55.316 --> 30:04.309
when time came for for Navy discharges, they put on 
the bulletin board those people who had enlisted

30:05.403 --> 30:34.549
in the Navy after a certain date and would be 
discharged, if they could provide an affidavit

30:05.403 --> 30:34.549
under oath from their parents or former employer 
that they were either needed, had the job open farm

30:34.985 --> 30:51.504
back home, or if they were in college, they could be 
returned to their pursuit of knowledge.

30:54.027 --> 31:00.394
So I thought I was in that second category.

31:00.414 --> 31:02.376
So I sent my father a letter told him that I could get 
out of the Navy if he sent me an affidavit that

31:04.246 --> 31:23.747
I had

31:04.246 --> 31:23.747
been both employed and a student. And I could get 
out and go back to college or do something else.

31:33.878 --> 31:35.079
probably something else. I didn't add that, but 
that was my mental thinking. And so my father sent

31:40.326 --> 31:46.973
me a telegram collect. The destroyer was being 
overhauled and

31:48.095 --> 31:58.387
having her engines tightened up. And the dry dock 
at the time He sent me a telegram collect. He says,

32:07.381 --> 32:12.346
you knew how to get my name on a piece of paper when 
you wanted in the Navy. I hope you're equally

32:13.388 --> 32:16.611
resourceful now that you want out. Good luck and 
best wishes.

32:23.738 --> 32:31.746
So I went into a heddle with the yeoman that was the 
ship's rider. What kind of, what was the best thing

32:33.093 --> 32:38.261
to do? He says, well, it's very simple. He says, if 
your college, he says, we're getting statements

32:43.408 --> 33:01.615
from deans and registrars of colleges 
authenticating the status of Tom, Dick, and

32:43.408 --> 33:01.615
Harry. He said, we've already discharged two or 
three men on that. And he says, if you were in

33:06.919 --> 33:19.736
college, get the name of somebody down there that 
can read and write and certify where you were and if

33:06.919 --> 33:19.736
you want a book, go back. So at that time, the 
registrar at Texas A&M was a man with a fabulous

33:21.499 --> 33:31.652
memory.

33:32.830 --> 33:36.895
the cadets all commented about his memory. And his 
name, I can't think of it at the moment, but he

33:38.558 --> 33:53.698
became president

33:38.558 --> 33:53.698
of the A&M College of Kansas. Now, whom would that 
be? I don't know.

34:00.908 --> 34:02.550
Which became Kansas State. Yeah, they have an A&M 
up there. It's a candid state at that town just

34:08.068 --> 34:12.153
north of Des Moines. University town. And it's in 
the same class as

34:16.418 --> 34:33.499
those, well, Lansing, Michigan is the A&M for 
Michigan. Now this university over that I'm

34:34.846 --> 34:43.238
talking about is usually called by the name of the 
town that it's in. Just like a lot of people refer to

34:44.460 --> 34:51.991
A&M as Bryan or College Station.

34:55.757 --> 34:57.540
And so you wrote to the registrar? I wrote to the 
registrar and told him to bail me out. Bail you out?

35:05.373 --> 35:18.510
And he graciously wrote a letter authenticating 
the fact that Seaman Signelman, first class J.D.

35:18.530 --> 35:27.602
Hill, was a full-time student in that institution 
from so-and-so to so-and-so. And that bailed him

35:27.622 --> 35:31.347
out, you see.

35:39.376 --> 35:41.218
My father never mentioned it again. That

35:41.238 --> 35:45.302
was a closed book.

35:52.969 --> 36:02.678
Well, I guess that's enough about

35:52.969 --> 36:02.678
that. What's the next thing you want to talk about? 
Why'd you go to Baylor?

36:09.211 --> 36:10.613
Didn't you come back to A&M? No. So you came back to 
Texas, and instead of going back to A&M, you went to

36:13.077 --> 36:17.003
Baylor. Why? Well, that's a legitimate question.

36:28.720 --> 36:31.484
The truth about it is, I didn't want to go anywhere.

36:36.732 --> 36:37.834
You really didn't want to go back? I had learned 
navigation,

36:40.565 --> 36:56.086
I say navigation, but the fundamentals of 
navigation. I knew I was a good seaman.

37:01.933 --> 37:05.458
I knew that I could pass a third mate's license. 
because it tells you exactly, before you take the

37:06.687 --> 37:13.674
examination, exactly what you've got to do. I 
figured I could pass the third mate's license, but

37:13.994 --> 37:27.687
to stand for the examination,

37:13.994 --> 37:27.687
I would have to have another year at sea. Well, 
that's the thing that I had just turned my back on.

37:33.518 --> 37:44.732
One race I wanted out was I decided to sample the 
Merchant Marine and see what it was like to work on a

37:33.518 --> 37:44.732
civilian ship. Frankly, I liked the Navy.

37:55.925 --> 38:01.332
I thought I might like it better if I had more 
opportunity. And

38:02.982 --> 38:14.235
I came back and this road building was in its 
infancy. I'll mention that later. So I came back

38:18.640 --> 38:30.694
and without any trouble at all,

38:18.640 --> 38:30.694
got a job in San Angelo on a team. that had been 
organized by this fellow, I think his name was

38:32.429 --> 38:37.835
Gilchrist. Something like that. The engineer 
there. Yeah, Gilchrist. Was that it? I think he was

38:44.401 --> 38:47.625
on the faculty at Texas A&M. Yes, he was. One time or 
another. Well, for $150 a month, I would be

38:52.270 --> 39:00.478
instrument man on a... one of his teams. And most of 
it was just plain surveying and staking out and

39:03.607 --> 39:08.756
measuring off.

39:11.961 --> 39:17.210
Not a hell of a lot of erudition was required. And so 
$150 a month after I think when I was discharged I

39:26.311 --> 39:32.540
was getting $46 and some odd cents a month. $150 a 
month at that wage level, prices those days, was a

39:32.560 --> 39:41.973
good job. And so my father was very insistent that I 
go to college. And every time a college would open,

39:56.821 --> 40:06.070
My mother would pat my trunk at the lease and say, 
no, not this week, not this week. No, I wouldn't go

40:06.090 --> 40:10.114
there, I wouldn't go there. So finally I stood them 
off until the end of October, nursing that $150

40:10.134 --> 40:25.630
job.

40:27.365 --> 40:40.318
The last college in the state that was still open 
for entering students was Baylor University.

40:40.338 --> 40:53.592
My older brother had gone to Baylor, and I had a 
cousin and an uncle and an aunt in Waco.

40:54.972 --> 41:03.104
largely through him, I decided rather to continue 
the family argument, I'd go to Baylor. And my

41:05.548 --> 41:22.853
policy of Baylor was to take not the courses that I 
needed to know for any general special purpose,

41:05.548 --> 41:22.853
but to get a college diploma and satisfy the family 
I was an educated person.

41:28.857 --> 41:32.502
Well, in order to get out of there quick, you had to 
make good grains. If you made good grains, they'd

41:32.963 --> 41:44.920
let you take one-fourth more hours than the 
regular schedule. I think their rule was if you

41:46.903 --> 41:50.308
didn't fall below you had A's and didn't fall below 
a B.

41:57.668 --> 42:00.070
Otherwise you were back with the herd. So

42:01.932 --> 42:10.340
my policy was, then I went back to see you in 
merchant ships in the summer.

42:12.983 --> 42:21.291
And

42:12.983 --> 42:21.291
so the,

42:26.570 --> 42:27.332
Hi there. Good Scandinavian

42:28.875 --> 42:41.324
name.

42:42.406 --> 42:43.910
Well, I was in Fort Worth. I'll turn this on. Well, 
today is August 21st, Saturday, 1982. This is our

42:53.321 --> 43:00.051
second interview, and last time you told me that 
you did not like education. That's the reason why

43:00.091 --> 43:08.304
you went to Baylor, because it was the last school 
that started the latest in the year. And you

43:08.364 --> 43:14.413
continued education, though eventually got a 
master's degree. and a Ph.D. degree, which is

43:14.900 --> 43:19.506
somewhat rare for someone who doesn't like 
education. How do you explain that? Well, there

43:21.709 --> 43:29.961
was another reason for not going to Texas A&M.

43:35.108 --> 43:41.076
I guess two full classes had gone through there 
during the approximately two years that I was in

43:42.912 --> 43:48.423
the Navy. And so all of these fellows that I had 
known as freshmen were now

43:50.787 --> 44:05.916
sergeants and

44:09.676 --> 44:25.100
cadet officers, those that were sophomores, were 
now the majors and the captains of the cadet corps.

44:25.120 --> 44:38.400
And having been in the Navy for two years, I didn't 
intend to go back into a place where I would be at

44:25.120 --> 44:38.400
best characterized as a sophomore.

44:44.261 --> 44:56.156
Another thing I had kind of changed my ideas about

44:44.261 --> 44:56.156
engineering as a career. And

44:57.237 --> 45:09.332
the most important thing is I made up my mind I 
wasn't going to go there because even though I

44:57.237 --> 45:09.332
could go there as a non-member of the cadet corps, 
and to wear civilian clothes. That was the

45:18.229 --> 45:28.143
trade-out with the returnees, many of whom had 
been captains and lieutenants in battle over in

45:18.229 --> 45:28.143
Europe. So,

45:29.866 --> 45:35.674
I knew I could go there and live a civilian life, but 
you can't live a civilian life on an army post

45:37.122 --> 45:48.674
because they have reveille every day in the 
morning. And when reveille blows you have to get up

45:48.694 --> 45:53.599
the same as everybody else. And when the noon meal 
is served in Speza Hall, you're there with the
