00:06.663 --> 00:24.705
Actually, as it turns out, when George Bass in later years confided in me, that Texas A&M could not have come at a better time, because what had initially happened was

00:24.685 --> 00:45.445
George Bass had gotten his PhD at the University of Pennsylvania in Philadelphia in classics, and instead of accepting a teaching position someplace, he wanted to do research, and he needed money to do research, so he established the American Institute of Nautical Archaeology,

00:45.425 --> 01:00.112
he found a few benefactors, and he then began trying to do archaeology under the sea, primarily in the Mediterranean, trying to attract more benefactors and so forth.

01:00.192 --> 01:01.915
Well, in the early days, of course,

01:01.895 --> 01:16.393
with not many benefactors they didn't have much money and so it was really a project that was run on a shoestring and there were a lot of sleepless nights worrying about where the next paycheck was going to come from.

01:17.116 --> 01:26.545
The University of Pennsylvania had allowed them to use some space in the university, but they were not on the faculty.

01:27.166 --> 01:28.827
They were not part of the university.

01:28.847 --> 01:30.649
They were just using space in the university.

01:31.370 --> 01:37.135
So, Dr. Bass was really not associated with the university when we contacted him.

01:37.275 --> 01:38.797
He was completely independent.

01:39.277 --> 01:43.461
Now, Van Dornick was teaching at the University of Santa Barbara in California.

01:43.441 --> 01:50.131
And Dick Steffi was working with George independently, so he wasn't attached to any place either.

01:50.151 --> 01:52.735
So the only person who was really attached was Fred Van Dornick.

01:53.236 --> 02:00.227
So when they got here, were they administratively completely separate from you all?

02:01.188 --> 02:08.419
Well, you see, this is a very interesting thing, and this, quite honestly, led to 20 years of what I call trouble.

02:09.800 --> 02:12.102
I was not included in any of the negotiations.

02:13.443 --> 02:20.269
What happened is after a week or so on campus, George flew back to Pennsylvania.

02:22.612 --> 02:26.215
Dean Maxwell called me in and said, well, everything's all signed, sealed, and delivered.

02:27.016 --> 02:29.198
He said, we'll work out the particulars later.

02:29.678 --> 02:39.587
Well, by the time they got there later in the summer, in August, by the time they showed up, the particulars ended up like this.

02:40.327 --> 02:48.162
They decided that the nautical program would be a graduate program, but anthropology did not have any graduate courses.

02:48.182 --> 02:59.483
So they decided that since Ed Duran was interested in boats, that they would for a while teach graduate courses in geography.

03:00.509 --> 03:12.749
However, they would be tied to the College of Liberal Arts, not to the College of Geoscience, much to the disgust of John Calhoun, who wanted to see them in geography.

03:13.150 --> 03:16.035
But anthropology won out, or Maxwell won out.

03:16.856 --> 03:23.327
So it was an interesting sort of thing in the sense that they were anthropology professors.

03:23.307 --> 03:30.547
They were part-time, one-third time geography, two-thirds anthropology, one-third then geography.

03:33.074 --> 03:38.329
The other thing that kind of stuck in people's craw right away

03:38.309 --> 03:51.668
was the deal that they cut with them, which was essentially that they didn't have to teach more than one course a semester and that they would all be given 12-month appointments, which was something that the College of Liberal Arts didn't have.

03:52.009 --> 03:59.119
Only people in Liberal Arts who had 12-month appointments were department heads and administrators.

03:59.099 --> 04:16.864
So you can see that to the rest of the faculty in anthropology, all of a sudden bringing in three new anthropologists, George as a full professor, and Van Dornick as an associate, and Dick Steffi as a lecturer actually, because he didn't even have a bachelor's degree.

04:19.267 --> 04:21.991
Or maybe he came as an assistant professor, I can't remember one or the other.

04:22.392 --> 04:25.596
But anyway, but they come in with 12-month appointments.

04:25.576 --> 04:34.632
with bigger salaries than the people in anthropology and with a very light teaching load and only graduate courses.

04:34.892 --> 04:36.054
You only have to teach graduate courses.

04:36.074 --> 04:37.737
You only have to teach one course a semester.

04:40.061 --> 04:45.130
So this, you know, did create some rift early on.

04:47.073 --> 04:48.175
In fact,

04:49.775 --> 05:08.172
George didn't necessarily endear himself to the anthropology faculty either because in some of the early faculty meetings, I remember one in particular in which Bruce Dixon had accused George of not knowing anything about anthropology.

05:08.489 --> 05:09.870
And George said, hell no.

05:10.071 --> 05:11.692
I don't know anything about anthropology.

05:12.213 --> 05:15.977
He said, in fact, I'm proud to say I have never taken an anthropology course in my life.

05:17.038 --> 05:22.884
And so Bruce then said, well, then what in blazes are you doing as an anthropology professor?

05:22.924 --> 05:26.928
And he said, well, I'm an anthropology professor just because that's what they say I am.

05:28.530 --> 05:31.233
And anyway, it went on and on like this.

05:31.353 --> 05:38.260
And basically, Bruce was trying to say that he didn't respect George.

05:38.240 --> 05:48.316
and some of the other faculty kind of jumped on the bandwagon too, that they basically didn't accept, didn't respect George or the rest of the nautical people because they felt that they were not anthropologists.

05:49.438 --> 05:54.566
And in fact, Fred Van Dornick's degree was in classics, and Steffi didn't have a degree, so.

05:55.327 --> 05:58.172
In the catalog, they were listed as

05:58.152 --> 05:59.033
Anthropology?

05:59.193 --> 05:59.513
Yes.

05:59.534 --> 06:01.556
They were listed as professors of anthropology.

06:01.576 --> 06:07.462
But they had no official link to the Department of Anthropology.

06:07.722 --> 06:08.123
Oh, yes.

06:08.243 --> 06:11.246
Their budget, their pay came out of anthropology.

06:11.266 --> 06:11.827
Oh, did it?

06:11.847 --> 06:12.127
Oh, okay.

06:12.147 --> 06:12.307
Yes.

06:12.408 --> 06:12.668
Okay.

06:12.948 --> 06:15.090
Yeah, they were faculty members in anthropology.

06:15.111 --> 06:25.662
But they were not under the management authority of you, the senior officer for anthropology, were they?

06:26.165 --> 06:27.567
Well, yes and no.

06:29.451 --> 06:30.733
In the very beginning, yes.

06:31.254 --> 06:36.463
In the very beginning, I was given the authority to make the decisions.

06:37.265 --> 06:48.865
But after some of this rift developed between some of the anthropology faculty and the nautical faculty, primarily George,

06:48.845 --> 06:56.008
George went to Maxwell and said that he wanted autonomy.

06:56.109 --> 07:00.222
In other words, he wanted a program within anthropology much like

07:00.472 --> 07:02.475
we'd had a program within sociology.

07:03.396 --> 07:13.731
And so very shortly after they arrived, Maxwell granted them the Nautical Archaeology program within the Department of Anthropology.

07:14.292 --> 07:19.800
Now, this, as I said, started a 20-year nightmare.

07:20.601 --> 07:27.812
And the nightmare developed because as department head, I was responsible for what the people in Nautical did.

07:28.771 --> 07:31.975
and what they said and what they published and so forth.

07:32.856 --> 07:41.565
It was also my responsibility to determine pay raises for an article and also tenure and promotion and things like this.

07:41.926 --> 07:50.015
But on the other hand, I had absolutely no control over what they taught, how much they taught, what they spent, or what they spent money for.

07:50.515 --> 07:54.019
In other words, their budget had been separated from our budget.

07:53.999 --> 08:02.593
And George, as a senior person in that unit, reported to the dean on those matters?

08:03.835 --> 08:04.395
Yes and no.

08:04.916 --> 08:10.104
George generally reported to anybody who he wanted to report to, most frequently, to the president.

08:10.485 --> 08:11.487
Oh, okay.

08:11.507 --> 08:11.607
Yeah.

08:11.627 --> 08:12.648
He shortcut the dean.

08:12.789 --> 08:21.863
In fact, the next dean, Keith Bryant, really got ran amok of George.

08:21.843 --> 08:25.710
George did not like Keith Bryant, and Keith Bryant didn't like George.

08:27.013 --> 08:36.010
And I can remember this was about 83, 84, when Keith Bryant was, he was only here for two years as dean.

08:36.752 --> 08:39.497
But I remember one day calling me at home at about,

08:40.253 --> 08:52.828
I don't know, 9 o'clock or something at night, just absolutely livid because he had just discovered that Vandiver had given George $100,000 out of the puff.

08:53.973 --> 08:57.139
And Dean and Keith knew nothing about it.

08:57.400 --> 08:58.842
He just discovered it.

08:58.862 --> 09:01.187
I don't know how he discovered it at 9 o'clock at night.

09:01.488 --> 09:06.958
But anyway, he was just livid and wanted to know what role I had in this.

09:07.379 --> 09:09.162
And I told him, this is news to me.

09:09.182 --> 09:11.166
I said, I know nothing about this.

09:12.108 --> 09:15.154
And I said, as usual, I'm out of the loop.

09:15.826 --> 09:23.701
But yes, George frequently went straight to the Board of Regents or went straight to the president.

09:23.881 --> 09:25.444
Rarely did he deal with deans.

09:25.965 --> 09:32.637
And during the, when did anthropology

09:32.853 --> 09:37.578
become separated from the Department of Sociology?

09:37.598 --> 09:37.798
Okay.

09:38.919 --> 09:48.129
In 1977, well, when George came down in 77, 78, we immediately, in fact, we'd already started writing a request for a master's degree.

09:48.749 --> 09:51.733
We got authority for a master's degree in anthropology in 1978.

09:53.094 --> 09:57.038
While we were already a program, remember, since 1976,

09:57.305 --> 10:00.412
So now we were programmed with a bachelor's and a master's degree.

10:01.754 --> 10:08.870
We then immediately applied for a separate department, again, to the coordinating board, but that got hung up.

10:09.371 --> 10:11.415
And a lot of this had to do with

10:12.560 --> 10:13.661
a guy by the name of Reynolds.

10:14.763 --> 10:16.065
Wasn't he on the Board of Regents?

10:17.306 --> 10:24.255
I don't remember exactly all the details, but it was either the Board of Regents or it was the... I think it was on the Board, Joe Reynolds.

10:24.275 --> 10:24.976
Yeah.

10:24.996 --> 10:42.499
It was either Reynolds or it was... Part of the problem was also at the Coordinating Board, there was a problem of... I don't remember all the details, but I do remember that for a couple of years it got hung up.

10:42.732 --> 10:51.711
And we didn't actually become a separate department until the spring of 1983, and it was effective in September of 83.

10:52.132 --> 10:57.483
So effective September of 1983, we became a separate department.

10:57.503 --> 10:59.728
What about the master's degree?

10:59.708 --> 11:00.710
We already had that.

11:00.730 --> 11:01.571
We got that in 78.

11:01.591 --> 11:03.254
So that went easy.

11:03.314 --> 11:05.398
Yeah, the master's degree flew right through.

11:05.478 --> 11:08.444
So the bachelor's degree in 75 went through without a hitch.

11:08.965 --> 11:12.451
The master's degree in 78 went through without a hitch because we had the nautical people.

11:13.092 --> 11:20.265
And then once we got the master's degree in 78, they came over

11:20.718 --> 11:23.882
All of them but Van Dornick came over 100% anthropology.

11:23.902 --> 11:36.616
Van Dornick remained one-third geography until he retired, but George Bass became 100% anthropology, Steffi became 100% anthropology, but the courses were still cross-listed between geography and anthropology.

11:38.097 --> 11:49.510
Do you remember how productive you all were in the early years of baccalaureate degree majors?

11:52.139 --> 12:02.478
In the early years from 1976, well, we only had a few, like maybe 10 or 12.

12:04.321 --> 12:05.303
Were you saying graduates?

12:06.485 --> 12:08.149
These were undergraduates.

12:08.169 --> 12:09.651
I mean, getting a degree?

12:09.992 --> 12:10.292
Yeah.

12:10.313 --> 12:12.056
Or was it just majors?

12:12.076 --> 12:12.416
Majors.

12:12.557 --> 12:15.061
I mean, people actually getting degrees.

12:15.081 --> 12:16.003
10 or 12.

12:15.983 --> 12:18.185
people getting a baccalaureate degree per year?

12:18.665 --> 12:18.885
No.

12:19.146 --> 12:21.688
These are people who, I'm talking about majors.

12:21.708 --> 12:21.928
Oh, majors.

12:21.948 --> 12:22.168
Yes.

12:22.609 --> 12:25.051
I think we started out with about 10 or 12 majors.

12:26.732 --> 12:31.316
Before the master's degree, I think it peaked around 59 majors.

12:32.277 --> 12:39.563
And the number of people graduating every year was, I don't know, anywhere from 4 to 15 graduating.

12:40.784 --> 12:45.028
When we got the master's in 1978,

12:45.008 --> 12:49.773
Another little vignette here, which I thought was interesting.

12:51.075 --> 12:55.880
In 1978, in the fall of 78, we offered our first graduate courses in anthropology.

12:57.322 --> 13:07.613
The nautical people now were teaching courses in anthropology, and we were looking over people who had applied for the new nautical program.

13:07.633 --> 13:10.296
Well, of course, we hadn't had much advertising.

13:10.696 --> 13:13.159
We only had six people who applied.

13:13.679 --> 13:18.250
And I remember five of them had fairly decent GREs and GPAs.

13:20.154 --> 13:28.093
One of them, a lady by the name of Lisa Shuey, had a GPA that was good, but had GRE that was under 900.

13:28.934 --> 13:35.125
And I remember George was looking through this list and was saying, well, we can admit these other five, but we couldn't possibly admit her.

13:35.907 --> 13:39.373
And I said, George, listen, you know, what if one of these don't come?

13:39.633 --> 13:42.098
I said, you've got to have five people and have a graduate course.

13:42.158 --> 13:45.424
I said, for God's sakes, admit everybody who's applied.

13:45.573 --> 13:48.881
So, very reluctantly, he admitted her too.

13:49.703 --> 14:04.037
And the reason I say this is because she went on to get her master's in anthropology in nautical archaeology, went to Stanford and got a PhD, and is now a full professor at Brown University.

14:05.688 --> 14:10.115
So I love to tell this story because GREs are not everything, you know.

14:10.135 --> 14:18.568
But anyway, so they began teaching graduate courses in anthropology and everything was going along fine.

14:18.648 --> 14:20.651
We became a separate department in 1983.

14:20.992 --> 14:26.380
I was appointed the first department head, finally, as a head.

14:27.068 --> 14:28.270
but still no pay increase.

14:30.274 --> 14:34.462
I lagged behind for quite a while.

14:34.502 --> 14:47.828
It wasn't until really late in Fallon's administration that he finally boosted me up into a pay range that was somewhat similar to some of the other departments.

14:47.808 --> 14:58.365
And one of the things that, of course, as an administrator, you know this as well as I do, but one of the things that I'd always argued for as a department head was try to get higher salaries for the faculty.

14:58.946 --> 15:01.430
And anthropology notoriously pays low salaries.

15:02.291 --> 15:05.557
And the argument was always made by a number of deans.

15:05.637 --> 15:07.940
I think they all have the same story.

15:08.421 --> 15:10.124
Basically, well, we pay the market price.

15:10.865 --> 15:13.950
And it just cost us more to get economy.

15:16.107 --> 15:17.189
But anyway.

15:17.911 --> 15:26.170
As you're pioneering with this section and then department, what were your private goals?

15:26.230 --> 15:28.716
What were you hoping?

15:29.658 --> 15:32.061
Two things I was really hoping for.

15:32.101 --> 15:57.758
One, of course, was to get a doctoral program in anthropology, and secondly, to really establish what they had tried to do at Washington State University, and that was to develop a department around a focus of environmental archaeology, where a student could come and in one department could take courses in things like geomorphology,

15:57.738 --> 16:21.855
what we call geoarchaeology, which is a study of how sites are formed, could take courses in palynology and pollen or paleoethnobotany and plants, take courses in bioarchaeology, which is a study of skeletal remains and osteology, also take studies or come and take courses in zooarchaeology and study about faunal remains.

16:21.835 --> 16:27.181
have a department where somebody could do all of these different things in one place.

16:27.882 --> 16:32.267
And there are really very few places in the United States that offer this kind of thing.

16:32.287 --> 16:37.933
Washington State never really succeeded at their task.

16:38.234 --> 16:41.357
They more or less did it, but they never did really fully succeed at it.

16:42.338 --> 16:43.760
A few other places had tried.

16:44.260 --> 16:46.543
Some universities had

16:46.523 --> 16:52.372
people spread out in different departments where you could take courses in geology and courses in zoology and so forth.

16:53.093 --> 16:55.076
But very few places had it all in one place.

16:55.096 --> 17:01.565
So that was really the two goals, one to get a PhD and the other to develop a solid program in environmental archaeology.

17:01.846 --> 17:06.152
Did you have another program somewhere else that you kind of were

17:06.352 --> 17:07.674
thinking of as your model?

17:08.334 --> 17:11.839
Well, the model that I had seen at Washington State was the one I was trying.

17:12.680 --> 17:15.884
In other words, the perspectives that they had written.

17:15.924 --> 17:18.988
Yeah, that was a model that wasn't yet reality.

17:19.008 --> 17:21.231
That wasn't reality, but it was the reality.

17:21.671 --> 17:25.716
I tried to make the reality what they tried to make the reality, and I think we succeeded and they didn't.

17:26.157 --> 17:32.805
Is there any other program, was there then, that was already a reality that you were... Not really, no.

17:33.206 --> 17:35.008
Not where you could do it all in one place.

17:35.478 --> 17:46.356
During those, in the 70s and 80s, who were the other schools in this region that were competitive?

17:46.676 --> 17:50.803
UTS, who else?

17:50.868 --> 17:51.589
It all depended.

17:51.629 --> 18:06.845
When people would call us up or write or ask about coming to A&M for anthropology, we would always be the first to tell them, if you really want to do cultural anthropology, it's the University of Texas that really has, I mean, they have 35 cultural anthropologists over there.

18:07.445 --> 18:09.007
They have 55 faculty members.

18:09.027 --> 18:12.771
I mean, it's a big department, and their big emphasis is in culture.

18:14.132 --> 18:19.778
If you wanted to do physical anthropology or medical anthropology, the University of Houston was very strong in this area.

18:20.146 --> 18:25.351
Rice University was strong in very key areas.

18:25.371 --> 18:30.376
They were, when Norbeck was there, Ed Norbeck was there, they were very good in cultural.

18:31.317 --> 18:34.941
At times they also were good in Caribbean anthropology.

18:34.981 --> 18:44.370
And so it was, Rice never had a large faculty in anthropology and they were very good in certain key areas, mainly cultural, not archeology.

18:44.390 --> 18:47.233
So I would tell these students that if they were interested in archeology,

18:48.462 --> 18:58.557
that I thought they could get a better training here at A&M than they're going to get at any other school nearby, not only in Texas, but even in other states as well.

18:59.318 --> 19:08.471
And so, quite honestly, from the very beginning, our real emphasis, even at the master's level, was training archaeologists, not very many cultural anthropologists.

19:09.733 --> 19:12.817
Of course, there were people coming here for nautical archaeology as well.

19:13.799 --> 19:16.883
So once we got nautical really rolling,

19:17.707 --> 19:21.713
I need to back up, though, and tell you a little bit more about the Cultural Resource Laboratory.

19:21.733 --> 19:31.930
Remember, we had Irv Garrison came down in 1978, or 1977 or 78 from Missouri, and Irv was a real nice guy.

19:33.392 --> 19:38.460
He was a very good archaeologist, but I hate to say it, he was a poor administrator.

19:39.722 --> 19:42.567
His problem was that he was too good, too nice.

19:42.952 --> 20:04.757
And what happened was that as this program of getting all these grants and contracts expanded and got bigger and bigger, a lot of times what would happen is there'd be gaps in the funding between the time one contract ended and the next one would begin or you hoped it would begin.

20:05.210 --> 20:10.095
Well, in a lot of programs, what happens is you fire everybody when one contract runs out.

20:10.195 --> 20:12.357
And of course, they then have to go look for jobs somewhere else.

20:12.397 --> 20:15.940
And then when you get another job, then you got to go round up another crew.

20:16.521 --> 20:18.062
And this is a little pain in the neck.

20:18.683 --> 20:26.310
So what Garrison decided to do was that he was just going to keep the people on the payroll in between and make it up when he got the next contract.

20:27.311 --> 20:31.015
Well, through an accounting system that existed at the time,

20:32.227 --> 20:33.528
What happened was basically this.

20:34.089 --> 20:45.360
The research foundation would, or the university actually, would put, at the beginning of the year you would estimate what your income was going to be.

20:46.441 --> 20:53.829
And so we would estimate, or they, the Cultural Resource Laboratory, estimated like, I don't know, say $150,000, okay?

20:55.050 --> 21:01.677
So the university advanced them, $150,000, with the understanding that during the year they would pay them back.

21:01.657 --> 21:09.248
Well, these contracts would run through the research foundation.

21:09.969 --> 21:17.780
So the research foundation would then be billed by the university for these things, and then they would pay for it out of the contracts.

21:18.220 --> 21:23.087
Well, back in those days, it was a two or three month lag in all of this stuff.

21:23.948 --> 21:30.718
And so what eventually happened was that when they finally, you know, when all of this finally

21:30.698 --> 21:45.201
came out, it turned out that of the $150,000 that they had loaned to the Cultural Resource Management organization, they had only really gotten about $50,000 in grants.

21:45.421 --> 21:52.032
And so there were about $50,000, or they got $100,000, there were $50,000 in a whole, that would amount to.

21:52.467 --> 21:59.338
But this was not immediately apparent because of this three-month lag between the research foundation and so forth.

21:59.358 --> 22:06.429
Now, I was in charge because the cultural resource management was under anthropology, so it was really my neck.

22:07.170 --> 22:16.264
I was doing my best to try to correlate all of this stuff, and it was very hard for me to figure out when they would bill an agency

22:16.244 --> 22:20.430
and money would go into the research foundation, and then the university would build.

22:20.450 --> 22:21.431
Anyway, it was a big mess.

22:22.072 --> 22:36.592
When the whole thing finally came to a crescendo was in 1980, around early December of 1980, when finally somebody in some accounting office realized what the problem was.

22:36.913 --> 22:45.745
And that was, I think, because at the end of the fiscal year, they had missed putting the money back, and it had taken them from September to December to figure out what happened.

22:45.725 --> 22:53.499
Well, by early December, it was obvious that the cultural resource management was about $66,000 in the hole.

22:56.023 --> 23:00.090
They still had four projects that had to be written up.

23:01.272 --> 23:07.243
Most of the money was already spent on these because they had spent that money to pay the people for the past.

23:08.371 --> 23:20.682
Anyway, to make a long story short, Dean Maxwell called me into his office in the middle of December and told me to shut down the cultural resource management organization.

23:21.583 --> 23:23.304
And I went in and fired 22 people.

23:24.265 --> 23:28.729
I just told them all, hey, you know, end of December and that's it, buddy.

23:29.210 --> 23:30.311
You know, I'll give you two weeks' notice.

23:31.131 --> 23:38.378
So as of December 31st, everybody that was in there was out of a job.

23:38.358 --> 23:46.526
quite a few people, 22 different people, clerical and shovel bums and crew chiefs and so forth.

23:46.547 --> 23:53.173
And Irv Garrison was the head of the thing, so he was relieved of his position.

23:56.056 --> 24:04.365
And shortly thereafter, he left anthropology and went to environmental engineering, where he worked for a couple of years.

24:05.003 --> 24:13.454
in environmental engineering, and then, because he still had this contract for the Georgia, and then he eventually went to Georgia, and he's now teaching at the University of Georgia.

24:13.494 --> 24:17.599
But anyway, so we ended up with, you know, with no program.

24:18.119 --> 24:19.001
The whole thing shut down.

24:19.681 --> 24:31.416
Our source of revenue and training, which we were, now that we had a graduate program, let's say in 1978, this was 1980, we were beginning to use this as our training place for our graduate students.

24:32.729 --> 24:46.440
So in 1979, 1980, when all of this happened, I turned to Ed Jelks, who was the guy who had hired me at the University of Texas for that paleoecology grant.

24:46.460 --> 24:50.569
He was now at Indiana University and asked him,

24:52.793 --> 24:54.877
Illinois, I'm sorry, it was University of Illinois.

24:55.297 --> 24:57.742
And I asked him if he knew of anybody, and he said yes.

24:57.842 --> 25:04.895
He had an excellent person that was doing his contract work by the name of David Carlson.

25:06.397 --> 25:10.785
So we hired David Carlson, and he came down in 1979.

25:10.765 --> 25:13.330
with really a big problem.

25:13.470 --> 25:14.953
I mean, we brought him down.

25:15.013 --> 25:32.166
The whole program was, you know, was completely dissolved, and it was his job to rebuild it and do it in a physically responsible manner with the $66,000 debt hanging over his head, which it was...

25:32.146 --> 25:35.049
We tried to get the university to write it off.

25:35.289 --> 25:39.334
They had written off, we discovered, they had written off bad debts before.

25:39.954 --> 25:42.297
But for some reason they decided they didn't want to write this one off.

25:43.938 --> 25:52.688
We complained to the research foundation saying that part of the problem was their lag in two or three months of reporting.

25:53.869 --> 25:55.771
But they didn't want to assume any responsibility.

25:56.151 --> 25:58.694
The College of Liberal Arts didn't want to assume responsibility.

25:59.274 --> 26:01.697
So it was, and I remember it was,

26:02.875 --> 26:07.068
Oh, Tom, something was the head of Fiscal at the time.

26:07.770 --> 26:08.231
Tom Cherry?

26:09.314 --> 26:09.696
No.

26:10.317 --> 26:11.100
Howard Vestal?

26:12.364 --> 26:13.306
Eddie Joe Davis?

26:13.407 --> 26:15.052
No, it was Tom, somebody else, anyway.

26:15.493 --> 26:16.817
Not Peter Crute.

26:17.287 --> 26:23.615
I don't remember, but anyway, I got to meet many of those people anyway.

26:25.057 --> 26:40.797
Well, anyway, so we brought David Carlson down, and he did a marvelous job of getting us out of the mess and built that place back up into a respected organization, physically responsible.

26:40.777 --> 26:43.941
And eventually worked out... You said physically, you meant fiscally.

26:44.382 --> 26:45.403
Fiscally, yes.

26:45.824 --> 26:49.469
F-I-S-C-A-F.

26:49.489 --> 26:51.431
Fiscally responsible, yeah.

26:51.451 --> 27:05.130
And anyway, and eventually worked out a deal with the Research Foundation, with the College of Liberal Arts, and with the university, where the, and with the contract program, where everybody bit the bullet for a fourth.

27:06.106 --> 27:08.311
The research foundation paid a fourth of it.

27:08.792 --> 27:10.315
University absorbed a fourth.

27:10.495 --> 27:11.838
College of Liberal Arts paid a fourth.

27:12.419 --> 27:16.528
And the contract office paid a fourth.

27:16.548 --> 27:23.322
Part of the problem, and I don't know if this is really all that important or not, but in the early days of the contract program,

27:23.302 --> 27:38.103
Most of the types of things that we did were what we call fixed price, meaning that we would bid on a project for a certain amount of money and then we would do it.

27:38.324 --> 27:43.070
And if we could do it for less money, we got to keep the balance.

27:43.090 --> 27:49.039
Fixed price, that's like you say you're going to build a house for $100,000 and you do it for $98,000, you got $2,000 profit.

27:49.711 --> 28:00.669
Well, a lot of these funding agencies then went to a system called cost reimbursable in which they would only pay for what you actually spent.

28:01.411 --> 28:07.881
And the big problem with cost reimbursable was that they would not allow any money for the writing of grants.

28:08.462 --> 28:10.065
They wouldn't allow

28:10.045 --> 28:15.170
for a lot of little things that we used to cover with some of the excess for fixed price.

28:15.750 --> 28:22.076
So this is what made it very difficult in the later years to pay back some of that debt because we didn't really have a profit.

28:22.556 --> 28:26.260
In other words, we had to answer for every cent that we actually did spend.

28:26.280 --> 28:40.052
But anyway, so the contract office, the Cultural Resource Management Office, which was now renamed the Archaeological Research Laboratory from Cultural Resource Management under David Carlson.

28:40.032 --> 28:43.677
Well, things rolled along pretty well.

28:45.740 --> 28:51.347
Once David Carlson got here, the graduate program in nautical archaeology was doing very well.

28:52.369 --> 29:00.640
We applied for a PhD, but ran into quite a bit of problems there.

29:00.660 --> 29:01.661
That's in the early 80s.

29:02.242 --> 29:02.542
Yes.

29:02.943 --> 29:06.748
I'm trying to remember exactly when we applied.

29:08.298 --> 29:15.228
We got the PhD in 1989, but we had applied for it back by 84, 85.

29:15.308 --> 29:17.532
It was hung up for four or five years.

29:18.353 --> 29:23.260
Part of it was we really didn't have a whole lot of trouble getting it through the Board of Regents.

29:24.682 --> 29:30.070
Our trouble was that when it got to the Coordinating Board,

29:30.691 --> 29:38.989
There was a real problem in that they were saying that they already had too many PhD programs in the state.

29:39.169 --> 29:40.673
In anthropology?

29:40.693 --> 29:41.855
Yes, as a matter of fact.

29:41.895 --> 29:44.020
They said they didn't see a job market.

29:44.040 --> 29:47.788
There wasn't an adequate job market to support another graduate program.

29:48.511 --> 29:52.996
Now, we, of course, tried to demonstrate that ours was significantly different than theirs.

29:54.658 --> 29:55.379
Well, I mean theirs.

29:55.419 --> 29:58.823
I meant the University of Texas at Austin or SMU or Rice.

29:59.304 --> 30:02.868
Of course, Rice and SMU didn't really make any difference because they're private universities.

30:03.509 --> 30:08.474
The only other university that offered a PhD in anthropology was the University of Texas at Austin.

30:09.436 --> 30:18.366
As far as you know, did they take, even privately, any, any, offer any opinion about the A&M program?

30:19.088 --> 30:20.609
Well, it's hard to say.

30:21.730 --> 30:24.013
I'm not really sure whether they helped us or hurt us.

30:26.215 --> 30:27.496
It's really hard to say.

30:27.856 --> 30:39.006
They, at first, were not real enthused with the idea, but on the other hand, we knew a lot of the faculty over there, and at least some of them privately said that they were not opposed.

30:39.527 --> 30:42.169
So whether or not the university was opposed or not, I don't know.

30:42.229 --> 30:46.193
Was there any on-site visit from the Coordinating Board or any...

30:47.101 --> 30:49.625
The coordinating board came over here.

30:49.665 --> 30:52.831
Some of the people on the coordinating board did come over.

30:52.871 --> 30:57.680
And I can't remember who was head of it at that time.

30:58.281 --> 30:58.541
Remember?

30:59.743 --> 31:00.565
Oh.

31:01.847 --> 31:03.630
His wife is the... Yeah.

31:03.650 --> 31:04.071
Llewellyn?

31:04.171 --> 31:05.233
No, it wasn't Llewellyn.

31:05.253 --> 31:11.083
His wife is the Foreign International Program Director here.

31:11.587 --> 31:12.770
I know, but I can't think of his name.

31:14.034 --> 31:17.403
Anyway, but yes, we got to meet him several times.

31:17.885 --> 31:20.331
Very nice gentleman, but he was also very firm.

31:24.062 --> 31:25.225
And this is...
