WEBVTT

00:02.309 --> 00:06.994
from, what kind of attitudes, income, urban, 
rural? What I remember as

00:08.336 --> 00:21.790
being kind of interesting is how few people from 
Houston were at A&M, for sure from my high school.

00:21.991 --> 00:28.738
There was only one other, I mean, my high school, 
you know, I had five or six hundred People

00:29.343 --> 00:38.747
graduated from Lamar in 63, and only one other went 
to A&M other than the two twins that played

00:29.343 --> 00:38.747
footballs with us, four of us. The two football 
players, and then myself and one other. And I

00:44.040 --> 00:45.343
always... you know, I kind of thought that was an 
interesting thing. The Aggies, you know, I'd

00:49.740 --> 01:08.146
never heard of Muleshoe and, you know, Gosney was 
from Muleshoe and, you know, and Cut and Shoot and

00:49.740 --> 01:08.146
all these little places, you know, that I'd either 
heard about or not heard about. If I'd heard about

01:08.186 --> 01:09.688
them, they took life. And I felt at the time, A&M, 
maybe because I was in ag-eco, veterinary

01:12.914 --> 01:23.909
medicine and ag-eco, so I was in the agriculture 
business and not in the engineering business and

01:12.914 --> 01:23.909
the nuclear business and some of the other 
programs. But I felt that A&M was an agriculture, a

01:24.890 --> 01:32.120
rural-based school. There were some people from 
Fort Worth and some from San Antonio, but really

01:33.082 --> 01:42.094
they were from the small towns across Texas. And, 
you know, just were, you know, were just good, good

01:43.036 --> 01:48.248
solid people. You know, I mean, I just always 
thought. Was there any ethnic diversity in your

01:51.936 --> 01:56.326
outfit? If there were, I do not remember anything. 
even Hispanic in any of my outfits. And there was

02:07.493 --> 02:09.796
definitely no black. Jewish? Well, not that I knew 
of. I really didn't get to know Jewish people until

02:13.302 --> 02:19.371
I got into the Army. And there weren't many in the 
Army, but that's where I remember meeting my first

02:20.093 --> 02:27.780
Jewish. I mean, I was in the Army when I ate my first 
pizza. Because if you ate pizza in Texas, you were

02:32.444 --> 02:35.726
in a beer hall. Because pizza and beer went 
together. I was a non-alcoholic, so I didn't go to

02:38.729 --> 02:42.372
those places. And I remember I was at Fort Benning, 
Georgia, second lieutenant, when I ate my first

02:42.452 --> 02:46.856
pizza. So I probably led a fairly... protected 
life, you know, growing up and all that. But now

02:54.120 --> 02:57.988
there were some Catholic and Protestant. Yes, but 
because half of my family is Catholic and half is

02:58.008 --> 03:11.093
Methodist, and I went to catechism growing up, 
that, there's no, I never, Matter of fact, I always

03:11.883 --> 03:17.790
thought it was interesting the debate over 
Kennedy being a Catholic on whether he should be

03:11.883 --> 03:17.790
president of the United States. I couldn't 
imagine that debate. I couldn't, I mean, all my

03:20.534 --> 03:28.103
cousins, half of my cousins, I'm one of 42 first 
cousins, half of them are Catholic, half of them

03:20.534 --> 03:28.103
are Methodist. The two churches in our little town 
in Louisiana were next door to one another. I mean,

03:34.491 --> 03:35.612
you know, Some of those debates don't make any 
sense to me. They didn't then, and they certainly

03:40.178 --> 03:42.382
don't now. And as far as you were aware, the NM 
student body accepted people as individuals.

03:51.539 --> 03:56.067
Yeah, and I mentioned early on the international 
students. There were... minority international

03:58.154 --> 03:59.857
students. Most of them were Arab or Pakistani, so 
they weren't necessarily black. But there was,

04:04.605 --> 04:09.134
especially in the College of Agriculture, there 
was a lot of international students. And I was

04:10.075 --> 04:15.004
impressed that A&M was taking these people. I 
thought that was a good deal. And I went out of my way

04:16.807 --> 04:21.175
to befriend you know, a lot of them and try to help 
them. I mean, I wasn't in any clubs with them or any

04:24.295 --> 04:36.626
organizations, but in classes, if I saw one of them 
struggling or something and it was a class that I

04:24.295 --> 04:36.626
was doing well in, I would try to help them. What did 
you and your buddies think were the most

04:37.247 --> 04:44.032
prestigious student positions? Oh, well, there 
was no doubt. I mean, you know, the Corps Commander

04:48.056 --> 04:51.499
was it. I knew the wing commanders and the brigade 
commanders were important positions. I felt the

04:59.114 --> 05:08.063
funnest positions, and I feel this today, were the 
company commander positions because that's

04:59.114 --> 05:08.063
where you're really getting, you know, there's no 
staffs down there. You're just kind of

05:08.083 --> 05:18.634
interacting, and in the Army, you know, I 
commanded every position from platoon leader

05:08.083 --> 05:18.634
through Army three-star, and the most fun 
positions Position was when other my two company

05:19.188 --> 05:22.174
commands. I mean, that's where you're really You 
know, you know, everybody's first name

05:22.274 --> 05:30.370
Everything about them was there even a student 
body president then? If there was I don't know I

05:32.514 --> 05:41.652
don't recall that I mean if you were the Corps 
commander you were the leader and being president

05:32.514 --> 05:41.652
senior class and had some prestige. But it was 
usually a core guy. All right, what about your

05:47.447 --> 05:49.029
leaders? What did you all think of your leaders? 
Well, it was interesting. I saw that on your

05:52.952 --> 05:54.334
question. And Ted Hopgood, I'm having dinner 
tonight with Ted Hopgood, who I've always

05:54.574 --> 05:59.278
admired. And he was two years ahead of me, and Ted 
was a squared-away guy. But I always thought that

06:04.583 --> 06:08.567
tradition went a little far when they wore 
short-sleeved shirts on some of those

06:09.374 --> 06:16.182
unbelievably cold, wet, bitter, icy football 
games. Because I was sitting there with all the

06:16.863 --> 06:23.470
clothes I owned on and freezing to death, and there 
they were in their whites with their sleeves up.

06:23.490 --> 06:27.034
And I said, you know, I don't think that's good 
judgment. And so I remember saying, these guys,

06:28.035 --> 06:33.762
obviously, you know, there's a tradition here But 
there has to be some common sense to this business.

06:38.278 --> 06:42.726
But I always felt that they were, again, the Yells 
were very disciplined. It's not nandy-pandy. I

06:47.033 --> 06:52.301
mean, it's very professional, very predictable. 
And I,

06:53.403 --> 07:00.154
even before I appreciated regimentation, liked 
all that, so I always thought the Yell Ears. I

07:04.227 --> 07:05.348
didn't want to be one. That was not my personality 
to be out there in front of folks leading cheers,

07:05.669 --> 07:16.746
leading yells, but I remember admiring and 
respecting those guys. What did you all think

07:16.806 --> 07:18.228
about the band? Well, it's really interesting, 
and I've told this to Jeannie several times. The

07:24.218 --> 07:27.002
band, when you're a cadet, they're BQs. And you 
throw, you have deal fights, and you persecute

07:27.657 --> 07:33.424
them. And the minute you graduate, they're the 
greatest thing about the symbol. They are the

07:38.711 --> 07:47.723
symbol of Texas A&M when you may, you know, the 
score of the game may be 40 to nothing, but you won

07:38.711 --> 07:47.723
the halftime. Nobody can compete with the band. 
And so I haven't quite figured that out, how you

07:50.667 --> 07:56.314
could, you know, persecute them so much when 
you're here and admire and respect them so much the

07:56.699 --> 08:02.886
day you leave. I mean, it's the darndest thing. But 
no, that was the truth. And I was a musician. I mean,

08:10.173 --> 08:13.797
I love music, and I wouldn't have been in the band if 
my life depended upon it. But today, if a guy is

08:14.858 --> 08:21.926
halfway musically inclined and wants to come to 
A&M, I tell him, hey, get in the band. Did you

08:24.008 --> 08:25.069
know... That secret fraternities existed? No. 
You mean Greek fraternities? No, no, no. No, I

08:35.909 --> 08:38.814
wasn't on the inner circles of anything. No, I 
didn't know any secrets. The TTs and the stickers.

08:43.861 --> 08:44.222
No, sir. The stickers go back at least to Mr. Evans' 
day. Wow. Their symbol was the swastika. Wow.

08:52.454 --> 08:55.579
Which is far before the Nazis knew about it. And the 
TTs were the true Texans, and apparently they

08:56.622 --> 09:08.524
still exist, and apparently they each have one 
goal, to get their members in the key positions of

08:56.622 --> 09:08.524
leadership on the campus. Yeah, see,

09:08.544 --> 09:14.775
I was not a joiner. Excuse me a minute, let me 
just... Let's see...

09:22.137 --> 09:23.859
Traveled to and from College Station. You went by 
car, but you also hitchhiked. Yes. Describe some

09:26.882 --> 09:29.084
hitchhiking experiences. Well, when I went to 
Baylor, gas was 19 cents a gallon, but 19 cents was a

09:29.104 --> 09:35.930
lot of money. And what was interesting, because 
it's in my journals, when I was at A&M, I was buying

09:36.451 --> 09:41.696
stock. I was buying Halliburton, several stocks, 
as I indicated. And so I was a frugal guy. What my

09:50.943 --> 09:56.373
mother says, she would send me $50 and I'd put $25 in 
savings. As a matter of fact, I was one of Dennis

09:56.393 --> 10:04.007
Gehring's, you know, one of his at the Bank of A&M. 
That was my first account. And I was a frugal guy.

10:08.094 --> 10:13.845
And so 19 cents a gallon was a lot of money in my Jeep. 
did not get very good gas mileage. It was

10:18.421 --> 10:23.789
four-wheel drive, had a winch, front and rear, 
power takeoff winch. So it was heavy. It got eight

10:25.291 --> 10:27.314
or nine miles to the gallon. And so when I would go up 
to Baylor to see Chuck Rosenthal, my best friend, I

10:27.375 --> 10:36.488
would hitchhike because it was so easy. And I would 
just usually get a ride. Billy Provine would give

10:39.513 --> 10:41.436
me a ride out to Highway 6, you know, right in front 
of the administration building with the big oak

10:41.770 --> 11:03.076
trees, and I would just, and I'd have that guitar, 
and I still have the case, and I'd stand there, and I

10:41.770 --> 11:03.076
was not in uniform, but I swear the first car that 
would go by would stop, and, you know, and they'd

10:41.770 --> 11:03.076
say, how far are you going? And I'd say, Waco. Well, 
that was a look that Sometimes it'd take four or

11:06.593 --> 11:15.624
five cars to get somebody that was going to Waco, 
because you had to change a couple times to get to

11:06.593 --> 11:15.624
Waco. But I would get there fast, and I had my 
harmonica in the case and the guitar, and I would

11:16.665 --> 11:26.056
just play the whole way there. Never

11:26.096 --> 11:31.943
any negative experiences? No, never. I don't 
recall anything. I recall hitchhiking a lot, and I

11:37.026 --> 11:44.474
never recall having a bad experience. And you 
didn't go by bus or train? No, I didn't. Again,

11:51.082 --> 12:00.732
because the farm was so close and I had that Jeep, I 
didn't go back to Houston very much because I would

11:51.082 --> 12:00.732
meet my family on the weekends. you know, at the 
farm. And you had a steady girlfriend, so you

12:02.691 --> 12:06.538
didn't have blind dates with Tessies. No, and I 
didn't, you know, and I didn't travel to Austin,

12:06.638 --> 12:24.171
you know, I didn't, Jeannie and I were high school 
sweethearts, and so, and the folks would bring her

12:06.638 --> 12:24.171
up to the farm, and you know, she would come, she had 
that friend in Navasota, and And so, you know, I

12:25.163 --> 12:29.008
didn't do much. When she was here and other girls 
were here, how were they treated? How were the

12:34.014 --> 12:37.678
young women treated then, the dates? Well, 
everybody behaved themselves. You know, there

12:41.803 --> 12:48.051
was, you know, and I guess we could ask Cheney, but 
I. Were the big dances still going then? Cotton

12:51.792 --> 12:54.536
ball, boop dance, ring dance. Well, the ring dance 
was because I went to the ring dance, but I don't

12:54.997 --> 13:00.206
remember the cotton ball. Jeannie loves to dance, 
and I'm not very good at that. And I just... Kind of

13:08.971 --> 13:10.453
like wearing sunglasses. You know, I know I'm 
going to get car racks because real men didn't wear

13:10.533 --> 13:16.082
sunglasses and real men didn't dance. And I just 
wasn't a dancer. So I didn't do things like that.

13:21.471 --> 13:25.277
You know, I wish I did. Matter of fact, I... I have a 
lot of little aches and pains now, and they're all

13:29.913 --> 13:36.724
from Texas football, every one of them. They're 
not from the Army. They're not from combat.

13:39.889 --> 13:45.478
They're from getting broke up playing Texas 
football when you're too small and wanting to do

13:39.889 --> 13:45.478
good. And I remember distinctly when I was 13,

13:46.479 --> 13:54.452
I was late to football practice, and I was never, 
ever late. And the coach said, House, why are you

13:55.006 --> 13:57.630
late? And I said, well, because the piano teacher 
kept me late. And all my buddies ridiculed me, and

14:01.896 --> 14:05.802
the next day I quit piano. And I tell folks I wish I'd 
have quit football, because I would be feeling a

14:06.043 --> 14:16.719
lot better now, and I would know I would still be 
playing the piano. What did you and your buddies

14:17.500 --> 14:22.988
know about drugs?

14:25.870 --> 14:28.153
I don't think anything. Did you even know the 
words? No. Beer, matter of fact, I don't know

14:32.278 --> 14:36.623
anybody that drank hard liquor. Aggies drank 
beer. They may have drank too much for me, but

14:41.449 --> 14:46.235
that's as much as Aggies did. I didn't know any 
Aggies that drank wine. I didn't know any Aggies

14:48.958 --> 14:51.962
that drank bourbon or scotch. They just drank a lot 
of beer, and I guarantee you, I didn't know anybody

14:53.107 --> 15:01.877
that took any kind of illicit drugs. And the 
athletes didn't do anything for bigger muscles.

15:05.240 --> 15:06.061
There was none of that. And people smoked 
cigarettes. Yes, but you know, it was

15:11.848 --> 15:13.870
interesting.

15:18.375 --> 15:19.736
None of my friends smoked. I don't have... I don't 
have one recollection of a friend smoking.

15:27.432 --> 15:33.684
Because I remember coming into the Army, and I was 
appalled that everybody smoked. I mean, all the

15:33.764 --> 15:35.628
leaders, everybody. And I never had smoked. But I 
didn't have that same sensation at A&M. So I don't.

15:44.322 --> 15:46.164
I don't remember. There was no ashtrays in my room 
or anything. As far as you recall, did you even know

15:51.428 --> 15:54.451
the word heroin? I don't think so. Unfortunately, 
though, post-Vietnam in Germany, I became an

15:57.594 --> 16:03.159
expert. I put 26 soldiers in the Federal Pen for 
heroin abuse from one rifle company in

16:04.240 --> 16:11.867
Baumholder, Germany. Wow. The

16:13.094 --> 16:26.330
notable people here on the campus, Mr. Rutter and 
so forth, did you know Old Army Lou? No, but I knew

16:26.891 --> 16:30.576
who he was, and I knew, I mean, I knew, and Pinky. 
Well, of course, we all knew Pinky, and we would all

16:30.916 --> 16:35.001
cheer, but I never... See, again, to know those 
people, you had to be somebody, and I wasn't in any

16:35.234 --> 16:44.649
of those leadership positions, so you just didn't 
know them. You knew who they were, and Pinky was

16:45.431 --> 16:53.384
kind of what A&M was all about. He was always 
around. All right, and that leads to a great A&M

16:55.948 --> 16:59.353
tradition, silver taps. Do you remember by 
chance... going to Silver Taps early in your...

17:04.867 --> 17:05.247
Yes. There's two memories I have of Silver Taps.

17:11.733 --> 17:17.940
You know, I remember going to a couple and I didn't 
know the people, the person. We didn't have too

17:20.442 --> 17:22.064
many. I mean, we did not have very many Aggies that 
died. But I remember the first time one of my

17:26.428 --> 17:31.853
friends was killed in a car wreck and going... And I 
remember that one. But what I remember about

17:36.350 --> 17:46.887
Silver Taps was the fact that it took precedence 
over everything else. And when it was over, you

17:48.329 --> 17:58.785
walked back without talking, and there was no 
talking, and nobody that I ever knew violated

17:48.329 --> 17:58.785
that. It was something above... everything else. 
And my

18:04.837 --> 18:22.062
oldest nephew, the number one grandson, and the 
nephew and the nieces, the one that was most like

18:04.837 --> 18:22.062
me, died here in a car wreck as a junior at A&M. And my 
brother was from Tulane, and I was a lieutenant

18:23.244 --> 18:30.274
colonel at Fort Polk, Louisiana. And my brother 
called me, and I immediately went on leave and

18:31.182 --> 18:34.788
helped. It was an unbelievable tragedy. But we, 
you know, there was going to be a silver taps for

18:38.013 --> 18:42.360
Curtis. Curtis, Glenn Curtis House III. And, hi, 
Ms. Chandler. But, so I, you know, I... I came from

18:56.630 --> 19:09.884
Fort Polk, Louisiana, picked up my brother in 
Houston, went to Austin, and we identified

18:56.630 --> 19:09.884
Curtis, and I did all that, and my brother was just 
in shock. And then the silver taps was coming up,

19:10.505 --> 19:18.013
and he didn't know anything about silver taps, and 
I said, Glenn, trust me. I mean, we've had a

19:18.173 --> 19:19.274
funeral. We've had all these things, and you're 
not an Aggie. but you'll never forget it, and it

19:25.283 --> 19:29.811
will help you. And so I came back. That was the first 
time I'd come back to A&M for years and years and

19:32.916 --> 19:36.081
years. And I was flying a little Cessna then. I had a 
little Cessna 182. So I flew over, and I met Glenn,

19:40.308 --> 19:45.116
and we had dinner, matter of fact, at Dennis 
Gehring's. Dennis had a big... Wanda, Dennis, and

19:47.170 --> 19:52.756
Kay had a beautiful dinner for the house family 
because we came from all over. And we went to Silver

19:52.776 --> 19:56.340
Taps, and I was so proud of the Aggies. Because I 
told Glenn, I said, you know, Glenn, this was a

19:57.462 --> 20:02.247
tradition when we were small. And it's so big now. I 
don't know if these kind of traditions really

20:05.511 --> 20:12.098
hold, but I guarantee you it'll be nice. Well, the 
Ross volunteers were perfect. All the student

20:15.221 --> 20:17.404
body was perfect. And when we left, and I had 
briefed his wife, who's a talker, and everybody

20:17.424 --> 20:24.953
else, when it's over, we don't talk. I said, now, 
when we get back to the hotel rooms, I mean, you

20:25.373 --> 20:28.737
know, we can go ahead and talk. But I said, there's 
no talking. Well, nobody else, there was no

20:30.620 --> 20:32.722
students that talked. I was so proud of the Aggies, 
I couldn't see straight. And my brother to this

20:37.908 --> 20:41.072
day, I mean... He may be the only non-Aggie to 
someday send money to A&M. I mean, you know, he

20:46.733 --> 20:49.599
really, he's had two children. He's had, his 
daughter's graduated from here, and then Curtis,

20:50.581 --> 20:59.020
of course, and then his other two sons graduated 
from Texas, but he loves Aggies. And so, silver

20:59.621 --> 21:01.305
taps. I mean, as important as Aggie mustard is, and 
boy, I've mustered in some strange places in the

21:02.450 --> 21:24.961
last 30 years, and I really, from Corregidor, I 
really think it's a great tradition, and maybe the

21:02.450 --> 21:24.961
greatest tradition because of my personal 
situation. The silver taps is probably the

21:25.022 --> 21:31.090
tradition that, to me, must continue. All right, 
Mustard. Did you go to Mustard when you were a

21:34.380 --> 21:36.304
student? Oh, every time. Matter of fact, I... 
Where was it held? G. Raleigh White. Every time.

21:41.476 --> 21:44.443
What did you think it symbolized? Well, we were... 
to the credit of the Corps, we were briefed on all of

21:46.747 --> 21:49.911
it. We knew what it all was and the history of it. 
Matter of fact, my focus is Civil War history. My

22:03.087 --> 22:06.712
next focus is World War II European. But I know a lot 
about Corregidor. In my last three and a half

22:10.457 --> 22:12.659
years, I was in the Pacific. But my...

22:16.801 --> 22:30.662
My interest in the Philippines all started in 63 
when they were preparing us for, you know,

22:16.801 --> 22:30.662
somebody in the company was given the mission, one 
of the upperclassmen, to prepare us for what

22:16.801 --> 22:30.662
muster was all about. And I guess I've spoken at a 
dozen musters in the last 30 years. And I've

22:36.851 --> 22:39.615
mustered in Vietnam. I've mustered in Saudi 
Arabia. I've mustered in Korea.

22:46.417 --> 22:51.004
You know, sometimes with two or three Aggies, and 
sometimes with two or three hundred. But it's

22:52.206 --> 22:55.952
quite a tradition. And the musters where you had a 
friend die the year before, and you answer here,

22:55.992 --> 23:07.491
you know that man. You knew that man. There's like 
five musters where that happened. And sometimes,

23:14.007 --> 23:28.860
unfortunately, the first time you know he died is 
when you get the muster packet, and I've been

23:14.007 --> 23:28.860
muster chairman a whole bunch, and so you go to the 
muster, and you're reading through, and you look

23:14.007 --> 23:28.860
at your group, and you see... you know, one of your 
buddies that died, and then as soon as Muster's

23:29.498 --> 23:38.832
over, you get back and you start trying to figure 
out where it happened, how everybody is, the

23:29.498 --> 23:38.832
family and whatever. So, no, it's, you know, 
there's some traditions there that other places

23:38.932 --> 23:45.643
will dream about. Of the interviewees that I've 
talked to so far who were here before the war, World

23:46.103 --> 23:54.176
War II, almost none of them remember Muster. Oh, 
okay. Well, it, yeah. It was a World War II. It was a,

23:57.986 --> 24:01.490
Crickador is what, now, I don't. It existed. It 
existed, but that propelled it. Yes, yes. You

24:05.616 --> 24:10.783
know, and, you know, the sun never sets on an Aggie 
muster on the 21st of April. That's right. I mean,

24:11.364 --> 24:12.345
you know. I've done, I think I've done 26 now. Yeah. 
Senior ring, when did you buy it, how much did it

24:15.589 --> 24:21.477
cost, where'd you get the money? Well, I think it's 
all here.

24:27.855 --> 24:31.599
Let me see if I'm, is it 66 or 67? Probably 67, yeah, 
it'd be 67. I just, I was looking through my journal

24:34.062 --> 24:40.670
and I found it. God, I hope I can find it again. I 
thought I marked it. Let me see, maybe.

24:51.263 --> 24:51.683
I just... It had to be 67, and it was...

24:52.979 --> 25:21.822
And I thought I even stuck the pages, because I paid 
for my Aggie boots, the final payment for my Aggie

24:52.979 --> 25:21.822
boots, but it was in... It was in the spring. Oh, no, 
it'd be, yeah, 66 then. Yeah, okay. I graduated

25:33.459 --> 25:38.686
technically in January 20th of 68, and I'll read 
that to you. That's kind of an interesting

25:38.726 --> 25:40.248
write-up. But on the 19th of April, Tuesday, 1966, 
it was clear in College Station that And they began

25:49.645 --> 25:51.808
early. It's been a typical busy one. Withdrew $25 
from savings account and paid the balance on my

25:54.010 --> 26:01.840
senior boots and ordered my senior ring for $34. It 
should get to me about July 5th or so. And so here is

26:08.507 --> 26:16.497
the senior ring receipt, 3376. And you had saved 
the money yourself. Right. And then I had been

26:20.533 --> 26:22.936
paying off. I have holic boots, and there they are 
right there. And I still ride. What's amazing

26:27.421 --> 26:35.370
about my holic boots is I still have my pinks riding 
pants. And when I do, late in life, I became a

26:35.390 --> 26:42.197
hunter-jumper. And those are my colors. And 
that's the boots you ride when you're doing fox

26:44.731 --> 26:48.517
hunting. But

26:49.098 --> 26:54.587
you would ride those on Saturdays or Sundays. But 
sometimes we would fox hunt on Wednesday

26:54.607 --> 26:57.411
afternoons. And I would wear my Aggie pinks. And my 
boots, those Aggie boots, and then I didn't, for

27:00.301 --> 27:09.939
some reason I must have had to turn in my midnight 
shirt, but I found another very deep green shirt.

27:10.741 --> 27:21.060
And so those boots, I continue to wear them, but I 
have used Propritz polish since the day I got them,

27:10.741 --> 27:21.060
and they have no cracks whatsoever. And I saddle 
soap them and keep them in good shape. How did you

27:23.603 --> 27:28.350
feel when you first put that ring on or put those 
boots on? Well, I remember, I think I remember more

27:28.370 --> 27:33.638
about the boots than the ring. The ring, what I 
just, what was interesting about calf roping is I

27:33.698 --> 27:49.140
was, I had a ring once on my right hand and I came off 
the left side of the horse and Because sometimes

27:50.386 --> 27:53.973
you'd come off the left, sometimes off the right, 
depending on the calf. And the ring caught on the

27:55.155 --> 28:01.127
pommel, and I almost tore the finger off. So I made a 
rule that any time I was working, I didn't have any

28:01.147 --> 28:05.916
rings on. No rings, no watches. I wore a watch and my 
button here. So around heavy equipment, from the

28:10.505 --> 28:13.390
time I was about... 16, 15 or 16, I never wore rings. 
So when you look at my ring, my Aggie ring, it still

28:17.233 --> 28:20.880
looks brand new. Because I only wear it to church 
and to occasions, I don't wear it when I'm working.

28:29.837 --> 28:35.107
So I never wore it with my military, my BDU uniform. 
I would wear it when I had a staff job, but I was

28:37.298 --> 28:46.768
fortunate that most of my career was in command 
positions, and I wore combat uniforms, and I wore

28:37.298 --> 28:46.768
no rings and no watches. And so the Aggie ring, I 
just was, there was two things about the ring. I

28:54.256 --> 28:55.137
didn't want to lose it. I'd read all the stories, 
you know, going back to World War II and

28:55.197 --> 28:59.561
everything. I didn't want anybody cutting my 
finger off in Vietnam, so I didn't even take it to

29:00.182 --> 29:04.947
Vietnam. Didn't even take the ring. I didn't take 
my wedding band, you know, and so two tours in

29:06.543 --> 29:13.069
Vietnam and just stayed at home. The Gulf War, I 
didn't take it to the Gulf War. And so it was

29:17.272 --> 29:21.636
something that I just didn't want to lose, you 
know. Then you don't have any story, unique story,

29:23.377 --> 29:29.302
about somebody having seen it at an unusual place. 
No, no. It...

29:34.987 --> 29:36.128
I just... I read that and I thought about that and I 
don't, you know, because I was kind of trying to

29:37.660 --> 29:47.496
protect the ring versus having it with me all the 
time. But the boots,

29:48.898 --> 29:54.467
I love boots. I love leather. And I always did. And I 
wore my boots every single day of my senior year.

30:05.082 --> 30:08.786
And they were always polished, and no fish ever 
touched them. Now, did anybody tease you about it?

30:10.989 --> 30:11.229
No. But after a while, they noticed. I always wore 
my boots, no matter rain, sleet, or snow. And I

30:19.299 --> 30:24.365
think I may have been the only guy that always wore 
them every day. And nobody tried to hide them for

30:25.406 --> 30:27.789
you? Well, you've got to understand, I was living 
in my truck. I was in H1 by then. I was in the married

30:33.215 --> 30:34.937
company. And I was living in the back of that pickup 
truck. So, again, you know, probably of all the

30:38.542 --> 30:47.062
people you've interviewed, you know, Eddie Joe 
Davis still can't believe it. To this day, he can't

30:47.724 --> 30:52.555
believe I lived in that truck all those years and 
all those months. But, I mean, I would get those

30:53.125 --> 30:56.289
boots on and off by myself. And the pickup, the 
camper was flush with the top of the cab. So you

30:59.792 --> 31:01.594
couldn't stand up in the camper. All right. Now, 
where did you keep it parked? Behind Guyon Hall.

31:05.519 --> 31:05.979
Behind Guyon Hall. And what I did is I was running 
all these cattle. I was spending more time at the

31:12.186 --> 31:14.729
ranch. You know, once you got to be a junior, you 
didn't have to march to chow anymore. You know, if

31:20.412 --> 31:21.514
You know, you didn't have to. Every once in a while 
you had to march the troops to chow, and then that

31:21.574 --> 31:26.161
day you were on a roster. And you had to, but you 
didn't have to march to chow. You could just show

31:29.727 --> 31:30.629
up. And so I was going to class, and as soon as class 
over, I'd go to the ranch. And we had a house at the

31:37.059 --> 31:39.002
ranch. I had those cattle. I was always doing 
something. And so after a while, I said, you know,

31:42.485 --> 31:56.635
I'm paying $450 a semester room and board, and I'm 
not eating at the mess halls, and I'm not even

31:42.485 --> 31:56.635
sleeping in my room, you know. So I went to Captain 
Simmons, and I said, sir.
