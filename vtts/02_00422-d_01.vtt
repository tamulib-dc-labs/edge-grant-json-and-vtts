WEBVTT

00:01.955 --> 00:07.481
Yeah, ours, except the summer, we had jobs in the 
summertime. Ours was classroom instruction. And

00:11.465 --> 00:14.889
we were involved, of course, with leadership, 
everything about leadership. And how many

00:14.929 --> 00:18.213
courses did you teach a semester? How'd they work? 
Did you teach one in psychology and one in

00:19.454 --> 00:22.578
leadership? What was your teaching load like? It 
was a progressive psychology with a plea for the

00:24.320 --> 00:31.067
first year, basic psychology. And then it 
progressed on leadership to finally the first

00:31.402 --> 00:40.656
class, when Pat went to Massachusetts, preparing 
them for those situations. Role players, role

00:41.076 --> 00:43.520
players. Situations that they could be in the 
front. And it worked, too, because I told you about

00:45.643 --> 00:56.038
the cadets not going to a basic course after 
graduation and got into Korea. And I talked to them

00:56.058 --> 00:58.101
while I was there. I went over with General Taylor, 
Maxwell Taylor. Now, there's an outstanding,

01:01.116 --> 01:04.160
there's an intellectual for you. Tell me about 
him. Oh, he's a... He's one, too, he's got just as

01:08.926 --> 01:20.943
near to all the qualities that I think that a 
rounded leader would possess as Marshall. You

01:20.963 --> 01:23.606
know, he's in that pattern. Except he's got one 
advantage over Marshall. He's a real handsome

01:25.649 --> 01:27.852
guy. He's a, even at old age now, he's up in his 
seventies, he's still a, he still is a Hollywood

01:28.422 --> 01:41.419
looking, because he has nice hair features, and 
he's done everything. He's an airborne

01:41.460 --> 01:42.861
commander. He's written books. He's an 
intellectual, can sit down with any Ph.D. and any

01:46.406 --> 01:51.493
inspector he wants to. He's not an expert on 
everything, but he's sure got a speaking

01:52.705 --> 01:58.451
knowledge of practically anything you want to 
discuss. Because he's a scholar. He's still

02:01.594 --> 02:03.316
studying right now. And just such an impressive 
individual. And all of his time is organized.

02:16.209 --> 02:20.653
And so I learned a lot by associating him with West 
Point, in particular going on this trip. Now,

02:22.034 --> 02:24.197
he'll go to the barbershop to get a haircut. Most 
people go and pick up the paper or magazine. Not

02:27.182 --> 02:27.682
him. He's always working on something. Reading it 
won't be fiction. It may be some very scholarly

02:34.593 --> 02:40.442
work that he wanted to be sure of. His time is all 
organized. And he plays tennis. Obviously, he

02:47.332 --> 02:48.394
plays tennis. He's an expert. He's really a 
top-notch senior type of citizen. Of course, I'm

02:54.726 --> 02:57.031
not sure he plays anymore because he's so old. But 
he won't play with anybody that's not better than

02:57.772 --> 03:00.798
he is. Of course, that's one of the big problems 
right there, because he wants to challenge. He

03:04.785 --> 03:08.652
wants to be pushed or stretched, you know.

03:12.359 --> 03:13.962
So I say he was a very... For West Point, he's the one 
who introduced this military sidecar and

03:14.482 --> 03:26.714
leadership back, just like General MacArthur 
did, although it was a little different than what

03:14.482 --> 03:26.714
MacArthur did, because he felt as 
superintendent, these are the things he needed.

03:27.635 --> 03:31.859
But on this trip, he was going, and General 
MacArthur had just been relieved. And so he was

03:33.340 --> 03:43.510
going to represent the chief of staff, really the 
president, I guess, but the chief of staff of the

03:33.340 --> 03:43.510
Army and the chairman of the Joint Chiefs, for 
instructions to General Ridgway. You remember,

03:48.236 --> 03:50.138
he took MacArthur's place. So he invited a member 
of the MP&L to go with him because he knew that the

03:51.680 --> 04:01.113
recent graduates had very high casualties. And 
you had comparison. The class of 49 attended the

04:02.936 --> 04:07.362
basic course, and they were . The class of 50 
didn't, and they were sent there. And so we wanted

04:12.028 --> 04:14.712
to learn as much as we could. about preparation for 
the class that was just graduating, and also was

04:15.383 --> 04:26.674
there a dramatic difference between the two as far 
as cadets are concerned. And so he invited me. I was

04:30.058 --> 04:40.969
the one who was named to go, which I was just 
delighted because being there at West Point and

04:30.058 --> 04:40.969
not in the Corral, I figured that sitting out the 
Korean War, I'd never get promoted even the

04:41.489 --> 04:48.319
colonels, because after all, we got people 
fighting now, and I knew I didn't deserve it. So you

04:48.419 --> 04:50.662
were eager to get in that war? Well, no, no, that's 
currently a little too far. Oh, okay. Then let me

04:57.032 --> 04:59.816
ask you this, what were your feelings about that 
war? I mean, would you have rather stayed at West

04:59.896 --> 05:05.003
Point, or did you want to go back to combat? Well, 
see, I was, my conscience bothered me, see,

05:05.064 --> 05:10.872
because Here I am, see?

05:16.787 --> 05:18.768
And I was ambitious, because I wanted to progress. 
And I knew that I was sidetracking myself. Now,

05:22.812 --> 05:27.656
that was wonderful living there at West Point, 
working those cadets with an inspiration.

05:28.077 --> 05:29.518
Because they are really funny. I was also in charge 
of the yearbook. And the cadets do all the work. And

05:33.982 --> 05:35.443
I've told you, they have a curfew. They have to go to 
bed. And they have to go out and get advertised.

05:41.902 --> 05:43.424
and do all their schoolwork. And to plan that book 
means that many of them are working up there on the

05:43.544 --> 05:48.131
book at night instead of studying. Of course, they 
have to be pretty smart kids to do this, because

05:48.611 --> 05:56.402
that's pretty tough, West Point in particular, 
since you can't crack the books like you do

05:48.611 --> 05:56.402
elsewhere. So here I am with a beautiful set of 
quarters. My wife's happy. She's got a music

06:03.673 --> 06:05.115
class. Everything's going along fine. I love 
football. So this was an opportunity to go. And I

06:12.302 --> 06:17.588
had an opportunity, the reason I say that, to stay 
there. Because they said, oh, great. Well, we need

06:20.231 --> 06:22.414
battalion commanders. See, I was lieutenant 
colonel at the time. And I probably could have

06:27.480 --> 06:29.963
pulled it to where I stayed there. But I'm not going 
to exaggerate and say that I was just so eager. And

06:34.408 --> 06:38.132
they said, oh, no, because it wasn't that way. I 
went there, and they gave me an opportunity to see

06:39.361 --> 06:46.091
firsthand what was going on and interview all of 
these cadets. With Maxwell Taylor. With him, too.

06:51.639 --> 06:53.281
Now, he wasn't superintendent any longer. He was 
the Pentagon after he was gone. I think he was chief

06:55.284 --> 06:57.908
of operations. So we left, and all this time aboard 
that plane, we were on a constellation. You know,

07:03.716 --> 07:05.739
the old full-motor propeller jobs. We had to land. 
I guess we landed in. Tacoma, and then in Aleutians

07:10.377 --> 07:16.283
for refueling, and then to Japan. And like some of 
those around in sleep, not him, he would be busy.

07:25.151 --> 07:27.533
One, he speaks several languages. So while he's 
there, he's reviewing his Chinese and Korean.

07:33.299 --> 07:34.280
He's got a card file. I don't know what his system 
is, but he's studying all that stuff. Finally, he

07:37.883 --> 07:41.007
looks at his watch, and he says, well, it's 
cocktail time. So he goes, gets up into his kind of

07:42.528 --> 07:47.594
compartment. This was a VIP configured place. And 
he puts on a sports jacket. And he says, ready for

07:53.982 --> 07:56.565
the drink. He'll take one cocktail, wave it 
around, you know. Now he's ready to talk, visit

08:01.351 --> 08:05.055
with people. So he'd come and sit down by me, and if 
somebody else said anything, he'd say, excuse me,

08:05.710 --> 08:11.618
I'd like to talk to Andrew. So he'd ask me all about 
MPML, you know, how has it been receiving cadets,

08:11.638 --> 08:18.727
do you have any problems, anything I can do. Pretty 
soon he's got a good readout of everything we do and

08:19.808 --> 08:25.295
what the situation is. Then there are other people 
that they always do go out on these tours that

08:25.315 --> 08:30.322
represent everyone, a supply guy. You know, the 
word goes out, we have room for 10 people, whatever

08:30.782 --> 08:34.367
it is. Who do you want to go to? The war emperor. And 
he goes and talks to them. Then he looked at his

08:41.950 --> 08:44.654
watch and says, all right, it's time to eat. So we 
eat the meal. And visiting time's over, then he's

08:47.798 --> 08:50.181
back working. And we finally doze off in our seats 
while he's still doing something. Now we land.

08:58.052 --> 09:01.317
Each time we land, both being the first one to be 
Tacoma, He gets out and exercises. Back and forth

09:05.551 --> 09:09.795
he walks, back and forth, back and forth. We land in 
Aleutians. He says, all right, let's walk from the

09:12.459 --> 09:20.568
plane where we were up to the hangar. He said, the 
time we get up there at a certain point and back,

09:20.588 --> 09:26.355
it'll be refueled and be ready to go. So we did that. 
Then when we got to Japan, and I was very fortunate,

09:33.916 --> 09:46.410
Because he said, now, you stay with me, and you 
receive all these briefings, too, because I think

09:33.916 --> 09:46.410
this will be of interest to you, and you might learn 
something that would be helpful. So I was able to

09:46.430 --> 09:55.241
sit with him in Tokyo for the briefings there about 
the war and everything about the situation. Now,

09:55.261 --> 09:59.005
this is interesting because they're leaders. 
MacArthur had already been relieved and gone, but

09:59.245 --> 10:03.450
MacArthur's staff, is the one who's briefing us on 
the entire situation, including his G2, his old

10:03.700 --> 10:11.491
friend, you know, that's been with him all these 
years. I can't call his name. Then we went to Korea,

10:14.555 --> 10:19.222
to General Ridgway's headquarters. And, you 
know, MacArthur had a peculiar setup. Of course,

10:24.890 --> 10:31.699
he wore both hats, both in Japan, and also he wore 
his Korean hat, the Spartan's hat. Plus, he had a

10:32.320 --> 10:33.943
split command. The Corps under Allman, yeah, it 
was Allman, reported directly back to him with his

10:35.185 --> 10:49.712
hat in Tokyo and not to the hat of the overall 
command in Korea. So he had a split command there.

10:53.617 --> 10:56.399
And very few people ever understood it or why he had 
it. So of course, the first thing Ridgway did was he

10:56.559 --> 11:02.705
consolidated where that corps reports to him the 
same as the other corps. But MacArthur, for some

11:04.786 --> 11:10.631
reason, wanted that direct link to that. Because 
he had his previous chief of staff, so he'd seen him

11:10.671 --> 11:13.694
done. And he felt that he would have control of 
that. And I say that's bothered military people

11:16.236 --> 11:22.161
ever since then, why you never want to split 
command. You can have nothing but trouble. And

11:23.789 --> 11:26.393
they were even competing for support. So I went 
there, and General Ridgway's new headquarters,

11:26.733 --> 11:37.489
or his headquarters appeared, since he was moving 
back to take over MacArthur. And Van Fleet, I think

11:39.672 --> 11:47.283
it was, took over the command, or Ridgway's 
command. So of course, the first thing Ridgway

11:47.343 --> 11:52.210
was, he said, the Corps reports to you, like it did 
to me. I had a briefing, and then I stayed with him to

11:53.422 --> 11:57.006
the corps. What did they tell you at the briefing? 
The situation? Yeah, just the situation. They

12:00.529 --> 12:03.652
didn't get it about who got relieved or anything 
like that. In fact, everybody stayed completely

12:03.672 --> 12:06.675
awake. Sometimes they'd refer to a gentleman who 
said this, but it has to do with the background of

12:06.735 --> 12:13.582
what they were doing. Went to the corps, got the 
briefing, both corps, and to some of the divisions

12:13.602 --> 12:19.848
with him. And then he went to go back to Tokyo, but he 
had told the headquarters there in Seoul that he

12:23.881 --> 12:33.172
wanted the headquarters in Seoul as far as the 
south. The front line was in Seoul, right north of

12:33.192 --> 12:38.539
Seoul. He told me what my mission was and told them. 
He wanted me provided with transportation and

12:41.502 --> 12:46.148
anything I needed. Oh, they said, sure. As long as I 
briefed them on the way back what I saw and what I

12:48.350 --> 12:53.196
intended to take back. So I had free reign to 
contact every single cadet. And some of them were

12:59.620 --> 13:01.503
up under fire. Some of them were artillery units. 
One was down in the engineer. He had a diving suit

13:06.851 --> 13:08.172
on. He was down in the bottom of the Han River with a 
torch cutting some of the wreckage of the bridge

13:08.213 --> 13:16.164
down there. Of course, I didn't go down there to 
talk to him. That's where he came up from. What they

13:21.948 --> 13:30.101
had done, because of that yo-yo back and forth in 
Seoul, the engineers had equipment to rebuild the

13:21.948 --> 13:30.101
bridge. And they were in the way. Then the Chinese 
came in. And the Chinese and the Koreans attacked.

13:39.656 --> 13:41.139
And they got all the way to Seoul. So the engineers, 
rather than haul that out, just dug with a

13:41.199 --> 13:45.846
bulldozer and buried all of that equipment. That 
is the bridging, railing, and all that steel down

13:46.282 --> 13:51.308
in the Kwan River. And what did these cadets say? 
Well,

13:54.691 --> 14:00.237
they were just like they're trained. They said, 
oh, they'd have been helpful, but we've gotten

14:00.317 --> 14:07.025
along all right. And the comparison between the 
ones who had the basic school, and that wasn't a

14:07.465 --> 14:13.292
great deal of difference. Of course, the class of 
49 said, yes, it was helpful. But the 50, they

14:16.589 --> 14:19.916
really didn't know. They said, I think this is just 
a small-arm war. You just get killed because

14:24.847 --> 14:27.152
you're up there. You have close-in combat. And of 
course, they all agree, as anybody, that of course

14:31.080 --> 14:36.792
it would be helpful to have more, particularly 
that engineer. See, he's not an engineer because

14:37.497 --> 14:40.661
he graduated from West Point. He had to go to 
engineering school to learn how to be a second

14:40.701 --> 14:44.265
lieutenant engineer. So the consensus was that 
they needed more schooling. Yeah. They would

14:48.271 --> 14:50.313
agree that it would have been very helpful. But you 
could come to one conclusion that when the chips

14:50.333 --> 15:00.546
are down, they'll produce what the military 
education they have at West Point. Mainly because

15:00.706 --> 15:05.412
to graduate from West Point, you have to be a pretty 
damn good... young man. Is that what you told

15:08.796 --> 15:11.059
Maxwell Taylor when you went back? Yeah, of 
course.

15:18.171 --> 15:32.053
My purpose, and I got complimented on it by the 
superintendent and the commandant, mainly the

15:18.171 --> 15:32.053
commandant because he's really the one that runs 
the Corps of Cadets.

15:32.073 --> 15:33.255
I told the cadets that You know, the word came back, 
and they do that in every war. We've been trained in

15:39.041 --> 15:40.984
problems. Korea is not like any other war we've 
ever had. So even if you've been to school, we've

15:43.829 --> 15:51.020
wasted all this time because, look, here we've got 
to do it this way. But the truth of the matter is,

15:51.040 --> 15:59.534
many of them were relearning exactly what's in the 
manuals to begin with. You get the time to stop at

15:59.594 --> 16:02.398
425. Oh, we'll stop as soon as the end of this duty. 
We'll stop whenever you want. And

16:09.603 --> 16:14.189
the manuals of sound. Everybody keep relearning. 
What if they go into that? They wouldn't have to

16:19.056 --> 16:20.177
relearn it. The same thing about fire and 
movement, plan, preparation. Doing it like it's

16:28.248 --> 16:31.913
supposed to be rather than improvising.

16:33.158 --> 16:35.481
Of course, you can be creative in certain things. 
But to fight as a unit, you've got to go about the

16:35.501 --> 16:40.267
basics of what you've been taught. If not, you've 
just got a mob going out.

16:50.280 --> 16:54.565
But the cadets, the class of 51, they went to basic 
school. And of course, the war was kind of shut down

16:56.167 --> 17:02.575
about the next year, 52, I guess it was. And we were 
doing better then because we got sort of boxed in on

17:03.905 --> 17:12.096
that Korean War. Yeah, right. Now, of course, the 
Korean War had a couple of very interesting

17:14.278 --> 17:18.864
affairs. One was MacArthur's firing. What was 
your opinion of that? Well, I think you really had

17:23.290 --> 17:25.493
no other choice. Either that or Truman would have 
to resign because you can't. See, MacArthur, in

17:30.900 --> 17:33.203
all his brilliance, He was a very arrogant 
individual. He didn't have much respect for

17:40.174 --> 17:42.236
Truman. Well, not many people did. I recall an 
election, everybody just laughed. You couldn't

17:46.762 --> 17:49.665
find anybody who was for Truman. And that's the 
reason the guy with the mustache in New York, he had

17:49.685 --> 17:54.692
a shoe in, you know. This little comical guy. 
Before the election, you couldn't find anybody

17:59.017 --> 18:01.300
for Truman. Dale went out and voted for him, see. 
Because he wasn't a comical little guy. He had that

18:06.726 --> 18:12.094
squeaky voice and certainly a terrible speech 
maker. But he, like we were talking about others,

18:13.717 --> 18:16.981
he had standards. And even though he was involved 
with our politics in Kansas, nobody ever could

18:17.062 --> 18:29.400
find anything that tarnished his reputation, 
even though he worked for the Pendergast machine.

18:29.660 --> 18:30.602
Kansas City, yeah. Yeah. And so he was a little guy 
that had standards and a strong feeling and

18:31.942 --> 18:43.738
probably will go down in history as one of our great 
presidents because of accomplishments. Of

18:43.758 --> 18:47.283
course, he had a lot of help with Marshall, for 
example, a lot of good people. But he made the

18:47.303 --> 18:48.504
decision. And so he should be given credit. So 
MacArthur placed him in an untenable position.

18:56.075 --> 19:00.801
See, he was going along with him until he just 
flat-wrote members of Congress contradicting

19:01.642 --> 19:05.166
what the president said and disagreeing with the 
policy. And in essence says, I'm going ahead and do

19:06.447 --> 19:12.433
it like it should be done, see, in the way he thought 
it should be done. Now, he probably was correct on

19:12.453 --> 19:16.617
his strategy. But we don't have an anarchy in this 
country if we ever get in a position where the

19:16.657 --> 19:26.207
military can just disregard what you're saying. 
Two, that he had no He had everything against him.

19:31.134 --> 19:35.780
See, the Joint Chiefs of Staff, all younger than 
him, much younger, you know. He hardly even knew

19:35.800 --> 19:36.661
them. They were all, he looked at them as plebs at 
the military academy, which is, while he was

19:36.681 --> 19:43.769
superintendent, they were even plebs. So he just 
ignored them, see.

19:50.397 --> 19:52.540
And he didn't figure the president, that's all.

19:55.473 --> 19:57.536
He just thought he could do that. Of course, I can't 
read his mind what he thought, but his action

19:57.556 --> 20:02.442
indicated. Now, we had a little situation at West 
Point that turned out all right. Because I have

20:07.128 --> 20:09.231
great respect and admire MacArthur. I think he's 
one of our great leaders, but not perfect by a long

20:09.251 --> 20:12.896
shot. In our yearbook, I said I was the awesome 
charge of the yearbook. I have all four of our

20:17.562 --> 20:20.806
yearbooks over there. We wanted to dedicate this 
during the Korean War. dedicate the yearbook to

20:24.582 --> 20:28.606
General MacArthur. So it had all gone to press. It 
was dedicated to him. And we had his picture in it.

20:34.773 --> 20:38.037
And here comes the president, and he relieved 
General MacArthur. So the cadets came to me and

20:38.097 --> 20:42.041
said, what are we going to do? So I said, General 
MacArthur has been relieved of our yearbook. I

20:46.406 --> 20:49.549
said, you want it to continue to be? Oh, yes, sir. 
But we have the same fee. I said, well, let's plan on

20:52.392 --> 21:00.704
doing it, but I'll have to go clear with the 
commandant, who's Paul D. Harkins, who's up in

20:52.392 --> 21:00.704
Dallas now. He's still alive and living in Dallas. 
So I went to Paul D. He was a colonel at that time. He

21:07.773 --> 21:09.796
retired as a lieutenant general. He was one of the 
first commanders in Vietnam. And he said, well,

21:13.862 --> 21:17.166
what do the cadets say? I said, they want to leave 
that yearbook just like it is. Plus, it cost us a

21:21.907 --> 21:25.631
heck of a lot of money to redo that and take all that. 
Anyway, General MacArthur knows we've dedicated

21:25.731 --> 21:29.556
this book to him. And this would really be a 
slapping insult to somebody who thinks that, see,

21:30.557 --> 21:38.466
once again, we've entered into politics, which is 
not. He said, well, I certainly agree with you. He

21:41.850 --> 21:43.632
said, I know the superintendent will agree. So he 
just called him on the telephone. And he didn't ask

21:46.515 --> 21:47.276
him. He said, this is what we're going to do. And the 
superintendent said, oh, yes. He had a different

21:50.999 --> 21:55.945
suit than Michael Taylor's long gone. So we had the 
book out and we made the presentation, which they

21:55.965 --> 22:00.611
always do. The cadets go up to the White House and 
make a presentation of their book. Naval Academy

22:04.196 --> 22:07.820
does the same thing to the president. And the 
president, he didn't have anything to say about

22:07.840 --> 22:13.388
that card. He also, deep down in his heart, he 
respected him. But he said, I just can't accept

22:16.672 --> 22:18.614
that. And, uh, There was another affair, of 
course, that was going on in Washington at this

22:23.281 --> 22:28.507
time and sweeping across the country. And that was 
this McCarthyism and the intense

22:29.288 --> 22:35.957
anti-communism. And even by 1953, when you were in 
Iran, of course, with the attacks that Senator

22:35.977 --> 22:45.068
McCarthy leveled against the army. And I was 
wondering what your opinion of McCarthyism was.

22:51.749 --> 23:01.320
Well, it's very difficult to express that in 
words.

23:01.620 --> 23:05.645
I don't think the man was normal. Of course, we know 
now he was an alcoholic.

23:10.991 --> 23:12.332
He was like a mad dog. Yeah, he got the general of the 
army. also the Secretary of the Army, but the

23:18.833 --> 23:22.379
Secretary of the Army kind of stood up to him. But 
that general, he just, boy, he just, the general

23:23.441 --> 23:29.270
was right. See, that's the hell about him. No 
question about it. And I think MacArthur knew

23:33.016 --> 23:33.978
that. I mean, MacArthur, because

23:34.178 --> 23:41.430
he played for the media. Oh, that's a dark page in 
our history, wasn't it? Well, did that have any

23:45.074 --> 23:49.099
impact at the officers up at West Point? Did they 
ever discuss this man? Well, I really not in that

23:52.503 --> 23:55.587
context. I don't remember anybody being

23:55.748 --> 24:09.265
not as much as critical of the unjust treatment of 
him. But they still browbeat. members of congress

24:12.833 --> 24:37.575
get a great kick out of when they get witnesses just 
here recently you know on the tank the m1 tank they

24:12.833 --> 24:37.575
were getting a general who's a project manager and 
he had the other people in he kind of talked back to

24:12.833 --> 24:37.575
this guy which that's not good technique he's 
going to point they're the last control thing but

24:12.833 --> 24:37.575
he was telling about the gao And their findings of 
how inefficient, expensive, and really stupid

24:39.445 --> 24:52.262
the M1 tank project is because you wouldn't order 
all these things before you had the deficiencies

24:39.445 --> 24:52.262
fixed, you know. And this general, I forget who his 
name, all the generals now knew they'd been on aid

24:52.282 --> 25:01.755
and most of my contemporaries were all gone.

25:05.901 --> 25:08.524
And this general explained what the situation 
was.

25:11.423 --> 25:14.487
He said, are you saying that the GA report is a lie?

25:18.092 --> 25:19.855
He said, no, I'm not saying that. I'm telling you 
what the situation is. He said, but the GAO, if you

25:21.838 --> 25:25.002
say it's not a lie, not going to lie. They say it's 
different than you. So this general finally said,

25:29.829 --> 25:33.594
well, do you believe me? Am I lying? Well, he kind of 
backed off and said, well, no, this seems to be a

25:37.900 --> 25:41.325
different. He said, yes. I think we're expert. 
Nobody in GAO is the expert in this field, and

25:45.450 --> 25:50.217
they're not. I don't care if they're retired and 
then go to work for the GAO. They're still not up to

25:53.000 --> 25:54.262
date. The only one who's up to date is the project 
manager and those that are actually tested and

25:54.462 --> 26:00.530
working on it. I don't know of any time that we've 
ever had people that go up on the hill to purposely

26:06.976 --> 26:09.099
mislead anybody. They'd be foolish if they did, 
because, gosh, the truth. You can't hide these

26:15.967 --> 26:18.410
things. And I've heard them go up and be perfectly 
frank about mistakes that we made. Yes, we should

26:22.174 --> 26:23.195
have done it.

26:26.399 --> 26:31.625
But McCarthy sees it that way, and I'm playing for 
the media, particularly. But just think of the

26:32.006 --> 26:35.650
really good people who he ruined their lives.

26:38.431 --> 26:48.223
by guilt, by association.

26:48.243 --> 26:51.447
No, I have to say that's a dark day in history. There 
were some who were communists, or at least leaned

26:53.850 --> 27:07.527
towards communism, but not the large number that, 
especially out in Hollywood, it couldn't write.

27:07.878 --> 27:08.940
no livelihood. So what they had to do, they wrote 
under pen names. They still did the same thing, but

27:13.106 --> 27:17.894
didn't get near as much money because they 
couldn't demand money. It's almost a handout.

27:19.576 --> 27:23.662
They'd write a screenplay or that and peddle it. 
And they'd say, well, you know, we can't use any of

27:25.605 --> 27:29.672
your material because you've been blackballed. 
Well, we've been in trouble. So they changed their

27:31.895 --> 27:33.998
name. Or let somebody else's name be put on. And 
years later, some of those people are exonerated.

27:40.325 --> 27:45.430
You can't just like sending somebody to jail for 20 
years and find out they're innocent like he said

27:40.325 --> 27:45.430
all the time. How do you ever compensate for that? 
Impossible.

27:52.758 --> 28:00.045
Well, would you like to say anything else about 
West Point before we move on to Iran?

28:04.951 --> 28:07.213
No, I can't think of anything. Well, let's go to 
Iran, but let's wait until tomorrow. Okay. And

28:11.617 --> 28:16.484
then we'll start with the really fascinating 
period in Iran.

28:21.451 --> 28:24.035
A few words more about West Point before we move on. 
Okay, great. Because it's a lesson we can all learn

28:24.776 --> 28:32.547
from what happened there in the early 50s. It was a 
cheating scandal. Oh, yeah. I don't know if you

28:35.171 --> 28:35.952
remember that. I discussed with you earlier that 
it's about as near to a perfect environment as you

28:37.433 --> 28:50.044
could find in that everyone's equal, of course, 
except the plebs in the class system. But for

28:50.064 --> 28:54.308
example, no one can have money there. So it doesn't 
make any difference if you're the son of a

28:54.328 --> 29:00.553
millionaire or if you're from a poor-form country 
like I was. You're all there, all the same thing,

29:01.894 --> 29:06.478
uniforms and so forth. through the years, 
athletes live with their own company. The only

29:14.220 --> 29:16.483
difference, and they ate with their own company. 
The only difference was if they would go any

29:16.683 --> 29:24.593
afternoon for two hours out to football training 
or any other athletic sport. And if they weren't

29:26.135 --> 29:29.659
out for varsity, of course, they'd go out to 
intramural. Everybody exercised.

29:34.706 --> 29:36.668
The great teams during the World War II, which, of 
course, the Military Academy had the advantage

29:37.154 --> 29:42.841
because a lot of the great athletes went there. 
Foreign education, also. I don't mean to

29:45.384 --> 29:55.676
necessarily draft Dodgers, but obviously the 
reason why West Point had a real powerful team

29:45.384 --> 29:55.676
during the war years, undefeated and that sort of 
thing. Post-war, then they were competing with

29:55.696 --> 30:01.483
other colleges on an equal basis. And, of course, 
Notre Dame was always their arch rival, even more

30:01.503 --> 30:06.469
so than in the Naval Academy. And that became 
almost a religious war. They played in New York,

30:14.266 --> 30:18.213
you know, using Yankee Stadium. Always a sellout, 
of course. And you had this tremendous

30:20.136 --> 30:24.824
competition. So to compete, the military academy 
was given, I think it was 30 appointments. Norm is

30:34.580 --> 30:39.824
congressional, and there's several categories, 
but normally they're congressional appointees.

30:39.844 --> 30:47.391
But they had authority to get 30 scholarships, 
approximately. So they started recruiting

30:47.411 --> 30:58.360
athletes,

30:47.411 --> 30:58.360
and they shouldn't have ever been recruited, as it 
turned out later on, because they couldn't keep

30:47.411 --> 30:58.360
up. They couldn't compete. They couldn't make the 
grades. That's right. And so now they moved them

31:02.063 --> 31:04.485
into a like we have at A&M and all the schools where 
athletes live together and have a training table.

31:10.751 --> 31:11.832
So they lived together.

31:14.795 --> 31:19.981
You could call it an athletic company or a football 
company. And they ate together on a training

31:20.001 --> 31:24.146
table, ate differently. And they were recruited. 
So these people tended to identify themselves

31:25.327 --> 31:34.877
more with the Army athletic program than they did 
West Point and the cadets. duty on and country.

31:39.279 --> 31:42.844
And A&M had two sections academically. I mean, at 
West Point. They had two sections academically.

31:48.132 --> 31:54.761
And so you had one group that went at one time, and 
every day they had a test. Then they passed on those

31:57.385 --> 32:04.375
to the other section between the answers to it. 
And, of course, the smart ones did that. They

32:07.806 --> 32:11.151
didn't have these dumb-ups doing it, and 
everybody would fail. So that was their attempt to

32:11.172 --> 32:24.873
keep these so-called cadets proficient 
academically so they'd be eligible to even stay

32:11.172 --> 32:24.873
there because they would be separated 
immediately if they didn't do their job. Now,

32:26.014 --> 32:33.045
involved in that scheme was Red Blake, who was 
really a fine individual, his son. handsome young

32:34.308 --> 32:35.930
man, smart. He was at the head of his way. He wasn't a 
star man. He wasn't the top academically, but he

32:39.214 --> 32:45.241
was way above the average. But he felt obligated 
not letting his father know anything about this,

32:45.261 --> 32:51.468
that he would help out on this. So he was sort of the 
leader of organizing how we're going to get the

32:51.488 --> 32:57.875
answers to these other guys. And they did. And that 
went along until finally... For how long did this

32:59.156 --> 33:04.062
go on? It probably went on for maybe as much as a 
year. I don't know. But one or the other. And

33:11.464 --> 33:24.458
another thing, it was so well organized, they knew 
who they couldn't trust, you know, in other words,

33:11.464 --> 33:24.458
those who were still duty on in country, lie, 
cheat, or steal, and won't tolerate anybody who

33:11.464 --> 33:24.458
does. And so some way they had it so well organized, 
these young people were isolated and wasn't aware

33:26.239 --> 33:32.766
of it. Till one day, one of those stumbled upon 
this. I guess he overheard it or something. So he

33:40.027 --> 33:47.595
immediately, as you're obligated to in the honor 
system, to report it, see, what he had heard and who

33:40.027 --> 33:47.595
the individuals were. So they immediately 
investigated. And they started looking into

33:49.637 --> 33:52.640
this. So some of these players that had been 
recruited went to Coach Blake and said, this is

33:52.700 --> 34:00.868
what the situation is. They've asked us to testify 
and

34:03.408 --> 34:12.139
a lot of people involved with this and it'll 
decimate the entire program. And Blake was

34:13.660 --> 34:14.842
shocked. He really was. He says, you immediately 
go tell everything you know about it. And you

34:21.510 --> 34:23.092
encourage everybody else. We're going to get this 
cleared up once and for all. What is the result?

34:25.515 --> 34:27.878
About 40 something around that. I've even 
forgotten. We're, of course, separated from the

34:29.480 --> 34:32.183
school. And what really broke Blake's heart and a 
lot of other people, including those with his son,

34:32.905 --> 34:42.575
who should have never been contaminated with that 
kind of thing. But anyway, he was as guilty as the

34:42.595 --> 34:46.038
rest of them because he passed on information. And 
so, of course, the moral of that story, the lesson

34:46.859 --> 34:59.352
we learned is that

34:46.859 --> 34:59.352
if you deviate from custom in something that's 
real fine, for the short-term game, you know,

35:00.580 --> 35:03.784
winning football game. Because they weren't 
making money. They didn't like a great big

35:05.926 --> 35:08.249
athletic program. Well, of course, they're 
supporting their own program. But it isn't a case

35:10.892 --> 35:18.901
of trying to compete worldwide or nationwide, 
like Notre Dame, for example, with their

35:10.892 --> 35:18.901
recruiting program. All they did is just disgrace 
military academy. It took them, oh gosh, several

35:25.109 --> 35:27.972
years to get over that. And it took several years 
for that. The athletic program actually has never

35:30.520 --> 35:33.303
recovered from that. Because you get some 
athletes now, you try to recruit them to go to West

35:34.825 --> 35:39.691
Point. Of course, now everybody thinks about 
professional football and big contracts. Sure.

35:45.198 --> 35:50.504
Well, just like their graduate now, who's a 
lieutenant down at Benning. He worked out with the

35:50.524 --> 35:55.690
Cowboys because he hoped to do like Staubach here. 
He fulfilled his obligation. to still be able to

35:57.972 --> 36:02.077
play, but he doesn't have the talent to stall back 
there. Well, that's the end of the West Point idea.

36:05.882 --> 36:09.126
Vince Lombardi was there as assistant coach, but 
he wasn't involved with this. He was assistant

36:09.267 --> 36:12.591
coach before, there for one year. Did you feel that 
Congress put a lot of pressure on West Point? In

36:18.779 --> 36:20.020
what way? Did Congress, as far as the 
investigations were concerned today, I mean,

36:20.040 --> 36:27.490
I've heard sometimes that, you know, the military 
academies are sort of a nice whipping boy for uh

36:27.757 --> 36:56.734
congressman no i don't think so not now i don't know 
about this last you know we've had another team i

36:27.757 --> 36:56.734
don't know anything about that now that might 
apply in that case because i think downey from up in

36:27.757 --> 36:56.734
new york personally because that's in his area 
sure that's pointed then he has a responsibility

36:27.757 --> 36:56.734
but no there was absolutely no pressure in fact uh 
The reason why you would sabotage, you would

36:58.334 --> 37:11.648
demolish the school if you permitted that to 
happen. And I think this last time they tried, some

37:11.668 --> 37:18.975
of the cadets thought there were so many involved 
that they wouldn't possibly investigate this.

37:19.856 --> 37:23.339
Look what a disgrace this would be if they would try 
to paper over it. But it wasn't the case with that

37:24.381 --> 37:26.122
athletic thing. I was all out on that. mainly 
because you had to coach himself. He was such a

37:32.036 --> 37:32.898
shock. Now, he's, of course, a graduate, but he is 
just a tremendous guy and a leader. That's the

37:41.633 --> 37:42.294
thing about it. He was getting good results out of 
the normal cadets that you would get through

37:42.314 --> 37:47.063
appointments. Of course, you get a lot of good 
athletes by normal appointments,

37:47.083 --> 37:51.831
congressional, because that's who you're 
looking for. In the high school, some of these

37:52.537 --> 37:56.064
outstanding young men go to West Point. They're 
high academic. They're captain of their team. No,

38:00.693 --> 38:03.578
I was there at that time, and there was no pressure 
at all. In fact, I think they felt sorry for the

38:03.618 --> 38:08.928
situation. Sorry that it occurred. They weren't 
sympathetic with a cheater. Well, let's turn to

38:14.744 --> 38:21.733
the next assignment, and that's advisor to the G-3 
of the Imperial Iranian Army. And this was 1951 to

38:22.254 --> 38:24.717
1954? No, that was two years. I went in 1952 to 1954, 
wasn't it? Yeah. Yeah, because in 1955 you

38:36.393 --> 38:39.757
attended the Air Forces Staff College. 1952 to 
1954. Okay.

38:44.377 --> 38:47.760
Tell me about this job, all your functions and 
duties. Well, I was assigned there initially,

38:48.040 --> 39:00.672
doesn't show on that, as advisor to the commanding 
general staff college, school there, let's say.

39:00.692 --> 39:06.677
And I arrived in the commanding general there, 
General Zimmerman. He got to know me. I didn't know

39:10.321 --> 39:12.983
him previously. He decided he wanted me to perform 
a duties of the G3 of the mission and G3 of fighting

39:13.216 --> 39:23.209
to the Iranian army. So I took that job and the one 
who was going to have that, he went to the command

39:23.229 --> 39:30.238
and staff school. And

39:30.258 --> 39:41.333
our mission, the mission of the Army, the Armed 
Forces of the U.S. was to train and equip an army for

39:42.983 --> 39:47.808
internal security.

39:50.511 --> 39:56.557
Not even defense, of course, that would be far, but 
it was to maintain internal security or stability

39:50.511 --> 39:56.557
in that part of the world. Same thing we're looking 
for today.

40:03.305 --> 40:06.748
And it wasn't easy for several reasons. One reason 
is that

40:06.768 --> 40:12.214
most of the army was illiterate. Most of the nation 
was illiterate as far as that's concerned.

40:16.771 --> 40:18.693
Obviously, the Army would be. But the Army did have 
a program, very helpful, in that they did teach

40:18.713 --> 40:28.804
them at least to read and write. And it was 
difficult also because

40:31.126 --> 40:41.998
while the officers gave lip service, to wanting to 
improve training, to enhance the standards of the

40:43.042 --> 40:51.791
armed forces. They wanted to do it their way. And 
their way was, you never get out in the field and

40:56.035 --> 40:59.178
train. You always come back in the barrack. They 
said they didn't have any money for benzene or

41:04.583 --> 41:12.171
gasoline, but in fact, They did have, but couldn't 
get it, although Iran wasn't booming like it was

41:12.623 --> 41:21.396
when the shell was there with all this income for 
the price of oil.

41:24.941 --> 41:42.107
So we only provided that equipment, like trucks, 
some small tanks or artillery pieces,

41:24.941 --> 41:42.107
and trained them to use it. But to give you an 
example, our difficulty with Iranian, and it's

41:43.387 --> 41:54.559
typical of Iranian, is that we had a meeting 
because we had arranged, got the benzene for them.

41:54.579 --> 42:03.509
We were going to take them to the field of division 
and give them some field training, which they

41:54.579 --> 42:03.509
hadn't been out in the field for a long time. So we 
had this big meeting with all of the Iranian, the G3

42:03.529 --> 42:08.214
of the Iranian Army. The chief of staff of the 
Iranian Army also was there. So we all just planned

42:13.508 --> 42:16.893
this exercise and gave a date. And all of the means 
were provided. And so when the date approached, I

42:22.120 --> 42:29.209
went out to join in the exercise. Wasn't anybody 
there. And I went back to

42:33.675 --> 42:42.267
the department of Army building, the office, and 
there's all of them in the office. I went to the G3. I

42:48.607 --> 42:51.410
said, well, we're supposed to be out. What 
happened? He said, well, we decided we wouldn't

42:52.852 --> 42:54.714
go. I said, well, why didn't you tell me? He said, 
well, and he attended our command of Staff Guard.

43:01.241 --> 43:02.783
He said, sit down, Colonel Andrews. I want to talk 
to you. He said, you must understand, in our

43:04.665 --> 43:12.473
countries, sometimes we have commissions in 
order to do nothing. Well, I said, why didn't you

43:14.174 --> 43:18.219
tell me that's what we were doing, having a 
commission in order to do nothing? He said,

43:18.239 --> 43:20.082
because we like you so much. We don't want to 
disappoint you. I know how you feel about this. The

43:24.367 --> 43:28.533
general, who was Zimmerman at that time, later on 
McClure. Well, that opened my eyes then, because

43:29.554 --> 43:36.624
then I knew that you're going to have to approach 
him entirely differently. How did you change your

43:36.644 --> 43:38.246
approach? Well,

43:38.266 --> 43:42.932
it was very difficult, but You had to work, and we 
didn't have any advisors in the field. You had to

43:48.016 --> 43:52.560
work then through the G3, talk to him. But I went 
down to the division commander. And in this

43:56.424 --> 44:03.110
instance, it was General Bakhtiari, who was a 
brother-in-law of the Shah. And he was very

44:04.371 --> 44:05.612
receptive. Oh, yes, he wanted to do that. He 
actually warped the digs and got out. We worked

44:11.330 --> 44:13.112
with him, and he got all set. Then I talked to him and 
said, now, General Bakhtar is all ready to go on

44:13.412 --> 44:16.956
this. And unless you disagree, this is the way 
we're supposed to conduct it. And they'd say,

44:24.023 --> 44:26.166
Bali, oh, yes, that's fine. Another

44:26.346 --> 44:34.494
example of Iranians, they had a small parachute 
group. We had about one officer and I think eight

44:34.514 --> 44:36.837
people. They had C-47s that they were flying a few. 
And they had Azerbaijani Day. That's the day they

44:42.409 --> 44:43.691
celebrate. They say, the Iranians say, they 
kicked the Russians out of Azerbaijan. But you

44:50.161 --> 44:54.728
remember Harry Truman told them that they better 
get out of there or else. So each year. So they have

44:56.211 --> 44:57.393
the Russians there. We're all in there on the 
attache sitting there. So the planes fly over and

45:00.297 --> 45:06.527
out jumps the parachute. But they continue on. And 
another stick comes out. And here comes another

45:09.869 --> 45:11.932
plane and another stick. And the Russians sitting 
next to me, I got a guy to interpret. They were

45:17.059 --> 45:17.760
talking. I said, what did they say? I said, the 
Russians just said they had no idea that the

45:18.601 --> 45:24.009
Iranians had that many paratroopers. Well, what 
they had done, see, the live jumped out first. And

45:27.814 --> 45:30.758
they threw out dummies all along at a greater 
distance. And they had troops on the ground

45:30.778 --> 45:34.062
hidden, you know. So when they got down, they all 
came up all intact towards the target. And I could

45:39.147 --> 45:41.029
go on and on. We gave them trucks, and then we gave 
them, of course, antifreeze to put in the truck.

45:49.858 --> 45:54.564
They thought they could fool the truck by not 
putting it in there, so they didn't put the

45:49.858 --> 45:54.564
antifreeze in. And they sold it. Of course, all of 
the blocks burst. It gets real cold in a lot of areas

45:57.687 --> 46:02.232
in Iran in the wintertime. Another example of some 
of their thinking is we had a terrible C-47 Iranian

46:07.463 --> 46:13.752
Airlines crashed up near Tehran during Christmas 
time in a snowstorm. And when it turned out,

46:14.954 --> 46:25.128
looking at the records, they had 10 more people in 
that C-47 than was safe. But they weren't on the

46:25.148 --> 46:27.812
manifest. Loading them in Abaddon, this guy 
thought that if he didn't, missed them on the

46:31.848 --> 46:34.610
manifest, see the plane wouldn't know the 
difference. This is just a man-made rule, you

46:34.751 --> 46:39.054
know. And that's what you're faced with, with 
training these people. They have their own

46:43.859 --> 46:50.745
approach to a problem, their own set of values, and 
it's very difficult to penetrate. But as I talked

46:51.886 --> 47:00.353
about yesterday, Iran, of course, as you know, 
being not a homogeneous nation,
