WEBVTT

00:01.803 --> 00:04.947
headed that until the early 60s. And in, I believe 
it is 62, according to the news, T's news, he's

00:05.868 --> 00:18.143
listed as director of the Engineering Experiment 
Station. Kahan? Yeah, Kahan. Yes. I believe he

00:20.786 --> 00:25.171
handled that and the Research Foundation 
together. And of course, the operations were

00:25.191 --> 00:30.578
small.

00:34.000 --> 00:48.799
Then he went to

00:34.000 --> 00:48.799
Oklahoma, and I think he went to the University of 
Oklahoma on that stick, and took charge of their

00:34.000 --> 00:48.799
research foundation. Dean Benson was in charge of 
it, and then they kind of put him in charge, and then

00:50.061 --> 00:54.867
Benson took it back again? I guess so, yes.

01:03.532 --> 01:07.496
That's the engineering experience. And he took it 
back again alongside his duties as dean of

01:07.516 --> 01:14.522
engineering. And TTI. Yes, that's right. He was 
the executive officer of the Texas

01:15.803 --> 01:25.031
Transportation Institute, two or three 
agencies. Did you see much of him, or was he? Oh,

01:30.396 --> 01:31.277
yes, he was. He was in everything. Once in a while, 
you'd see him around. Because he had so many

01:35.521 --> 01:42.150
different jobs he was doing, he wondered if he ever 
had time to get out of his office.

01:42.931 --> 01:44.072
Oh, yes. Because I gave him the research 
foundation in the mid-'60s, too.

01:53.584 --> 02:00.353
Between the time you came here in the mid-'40s to 
the time you went to TTI, Do you remember any time of

02:00.738 --> 02:12.390
big change or a low point

02:00.738 --> 02:12.390
in Texas Engineering Experiment Station?

02:21.739 --> 02:24.762
I don't really remember a low point. Nobody else 
has

02:25.222 --> 02:29.867
either. Did you have any dealings through your 
role in TEAS, in the education at A&M, educating

02:31.417 --> 02:40.670
students? Or was that separate from yours? Well, 
I'll tell you. Students have always found their

02:48.582 --> 02:53.008
way to my office, graduate students especially. 
And I've helped graduate students through the

02:53.849 --> 03:00.799
years with the literature they've needed for 
their research. And it would be usually the

03:01.032 --> 03:08.002
literature from the shelves. And they would use 
this in the research. They'd come by, and

03:15.333 --> 03:17.977
everybody knew of Mr. Horn. Everybody had that. He 
might have that, yes. We'd have to get it. Speaking

03:24.586 --> 03:30.735
of he might have that, everyone says you might have 
some of the early pictures or know where they are.

03:31.947 --> 03:34.749
that you used in the journal? Yes. Those would be at 
the Photographic and Visual Aids Lab. They would

03:39.994 --> 03:44.037
have a file of the magazine. The university's lab? 
Yes, ma'am. OK. That's where we had the pictures

03:47.100 --> 03:51.203
made at the time. We'd use their photographers. 
OK. So we'd like to use some of those pictures again

03:53.866 --> 03:56.288
in this history. We've got to find it first. Do you 
know where that lab is right now? It's...

04:11.743 --> 04:14.968
I don't know how you... Oh, yeah. Go to the printing 
center. They have a clerk in the front office of the

04:17.332 --> 04:25.165
printing center, and she'll handle your work, or 
one of those ladies up there will handle your work.

04:25.345 --> 04:29.292
And if you need to go back to the files while that 
lady would escort you back, into the photographic

04:30.048 --> 04:36.053
laboratory and you could look back there. Is there 
anything else you remember about your time at T's?

04:39.116 --> 04:41.738
Any other great stories you'd like to tell?

04:52.507 --> 04:53.508
It was all great work. I enjoyed

04:53.809 --> 04:58.873
it. I appreciated them and I think they 
appreciated me. We got along great through the

05:04.125 --> 05:06.429
years. I just, somewhere along the line, I just 
found an opportunity to get a little more salary.

05:15.865 --> 05:17.949
My salary became unclassified. Earlier it was 
classified. When I first started classifying

05:20.212 --> 05:23.578
salaries, so I To get unclassified, I had to go over 
into the Texas Transportation Institute.

05:33.267 --> 05:36.775
Well, I appreciate your time today.
