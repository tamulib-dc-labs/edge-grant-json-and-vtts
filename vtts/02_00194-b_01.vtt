WEBVTT

00:02.444 --> 00:08.421
Those remember the wrecking ball hitting those 
columns and bouncing. They had a heck of a time

00:08.441 --> 00:10.407
getting them down. And so that was a real tragedy. 
There was, there's a metal and glass

00:17.969 --> 00:28.880
sculpture that's kind of in a little courtyard 
here between Rutter Auditorium and Rutter Tower.

00:29.721 --> 00:32.023
It's kind of like a tree that's sitting there. And 
some of us immediately dubbed that the ghost of

00:32.684 --> 00:37.509
Guyon Hall. And probably nowadays nobody knows 
that. And I understand that no one notified the

00:40.592 --> 00:46.238
Guyon family that it was going to happen. And that 
they learned of the demolition of the structure

00:46.758 --> 00:51.907
when they saw a picture in the Waco paper. And a 
couple of years later, they made a very meaningful

00:52.808 --> 00:57.817
gift to Baylor. It was just an unfortunate 
oversight on somebody's part. Did

01:02.013 --> 01:06.420
you see We've Never Been Licked? Do you remember? I 
have no idea how many times. I definitely saw it in

01:09.685 --> 01:11.989
Guyon Hall. I can remember seeing it once when I was 
a senior with a couple of juniors having a good

01:13.231 --> 01:18.579
time. When you were an undergraduate and a group of 
Aggies went to see a movie in Guyon Hall, what went

01:19.841 --> 01:28.695
on during the movie? Oh, just critiquing the movie 
as you went. Out loud? Reviews out loud,

01:34.621 --> 01:38.968
responding with great enthusiasm. The same thing 
that happened at the Campus Theater while it

01:39.589 --> 01:44.036
operated at Northgate. Watching a movie there, 
you'd have to go see it again to know what actually

01:45.638 --> 01:50.506
happened. Because you would have people that had 
already seen the movie six times, and so

01:50.526 --> 01:57.096
everything would be anticipated. And if you 
hadn't seen it before, well, then you were at a

01:57.278 --> 02:01.486
pretty big disadvantage. Usually humorous. 
Let's see. I suspect among the unforgettable

02:06.274 --> 02:12.666
moments was a certain day in November of 1963. 
Where were you when you heard the news of what had

02:14.349 --> 02:17.334
happened in Dallas? I was on the first floor of 
Moore Hall. Well, we were getting ready. I was a

02:21.465 --> 02:22.186
junior. We were getting ready to go to the cut area 
to cut a couple of trees. And I guess it was the next

02:28.675 --> 02:35.784
night, Friday night, that we met in Guyon Hall. And 
we were told that we weren't going to have a

02:36.886 --> 02:41.091
bonfire. We sort of voted, but the decision had 
already been made that there would not be a

02:41.332 --> 02:46.038
bonfire. How did you hear? that President Kennedy 
had been assassinated? Television. We were in the

02:53.437 --> 02:54.158
hall. Somebody had on a small little black and 
white TV. And I can remember seeing Walter

02:58.406 --> 03:01.672
Cronkite. What did you all do or say? Shock, total 
shock. Everything just changed. You started

03:11.086 --> 03:13.290
listening to every word that you could get. Rumors 
started immediately about all the potential

03:13.350 --> 03:21.603
causes and stuff happening. I remember watching 
everything that was on television in great

03:21.623 --> 03:27.192
details. was watching when Oswald was shot, you 
know, watching live at that time, watched the

03:27.172 --> 03:39.783
funeral procession and, you know, very 
distinctive memory. Then that, the football game

03:40.364 --> 03:43.927
was the next Thursday here. We were, you know, 
beyond lousy. We were one and eight. In those days

03:49.892 --> 03:51.534
you played ten games. Texas was nine and oh, number 
one in the country. And we played with them all the

03:56.483 --> 03:59.467
way. I think the game was stolen from us. It was like 
13 to 15, I believe. And the fish drill team

04:10.160 --> 04:18.550
advisors, we had a 105 howitzer for the first time 
in cow field firing it at the game. It was a very

04:19.471 --> 04:22.415
overcast day. Mark Jackson and I got it. He was the 
senior. Of course, we'd been fished together, if

04:25.812 --> 04:29.466
you'll remember the older story. And O.D. Butler, 
who was head of animal science, was also in the

04:33.473 --> 04:36.077
reserves and had artillery pieces. And so he got us 
this thing. Denzel Baker and General Rutter both

04:38.641 --> 04:44.790
thought that we had all lost our minds, that this 
was pretty stupid. So we had in the

04:45.731 --> 04:57.709
simple condition of 1963 Kyle Field, they were 
worried about the sound. Well, we were in the north

04:57.976 --> 05:06.390
end firing south, and it shook the place, and it was 
very overcast. And when we fired, they'd have to

05:06.530 --> 05:11.218
wait for the kickoff until the smoke lifted. And we 
led most of the game. Texas was moving on the final

05:17.028 --> 05:19.332
drive. I think Brotherton intercepted. a ball or 
picked up a fumble, one or the other. Intercepted.

05:27.135 --> 05:28.116
Intercepted. Started running. If he'd have fell, 
if he'd have just fallen down, we'd have won the

05:30.438 --> 05:33.920
game. But he ran, he fumbled, they got the ball 
back. They kept coming down the field, they threw a

05:38.624 --> 05:47.752
pass, and a guy named Whittington, by photo 
account, you know, intercepted the ball. But the

05:48.673 --> 05:53.717
referee was 20 yards upfield and 20 yards to the 
side. and happened to have gone to the University

05:54.001 --> 05:59.848
of Texas and called him out of bounds. And then 
Texas scored. General Rutter let school out on

06:02.030 --> 06:07.116
Monday because of the effort. And that became a 
hoped-for tradition.

06:13.383 --> 06:20.311
Now, see, that's the kind of unforgettable 
moments that I'm really glad to capture in here.

06:21.012 --> 06:22.894
Let's go back to Bonfire. Can you recall your fish 
year bonfire activities? This year, F2 was a stack

06:29.691 --> 06:34.095
unit. We maybe went to the cut area once, but we 
predominantly did all our work, you know, loading

06:34.596 --> 06:41.503
logs and putting them on the stack. I remember it, 
but as I mentioned earlier, my official lady was

06:42.944 --> 06:48.370
from Louisiana. The head yell leader was from 
Louisiana. And so we were connected to the head

06:51.241 --> 07:02.014
yell leader and we were gophers for him running 
errands because

06:51.241 --> 07:02.014
my fish buddy had a car. And so we were doing 
squirrely things. I don't remember working much,

07:05.077 --> 07:10.344
except we did work stack some. And then... Do you 
remember where the cutting area was? I have no idea

07:16.210 --> 07:17.552
where it was. But it wasn't very far away then, was 
it? No, it wasn't very far. Five miles or something

07:21.889 --> 07:23.772
maybe. And the stack area was here? No, Duncan. It 
was already at Duncan. Already at Duncan. And

07:30.164 --> 07:34.391
about when did the cutting begin? The week before 
the fox. Week before. If you were going to have the

07:41.563 --> 07:49.334
fire on Tuesday or Wednesday, the Thanksgiving 
week, it was the previous week that cut began. And

07:49.374 --> 08:00.390
during the afternoons of that week, just like when 
we were getting ready to go when Kennedy was

07:49.374 --> 08:00.390
killed, juniors and seniors only could go to the 
cut area and cut a few trees. Saturday, Sunday, and

08:01.672 --> 08:05.477
Monday, there were no classes on Monday. were 
bonfire, and then it burnt on Tuesday. It was not

08:10.911 --> 08:12.173
sophisticated. It was basically the TP type 
arrangement.

08:19.666 --> 08:22.350
It should have stayed like that. And do you have any 
idea where that year's outhouse came from? Now, I

08:28.812 --> 08:32.756
think for a while, they were definitely stolen. I 
think it was probably early 80s before the band

08:32.976 --> 08:40.424
started constructing an outhouse. And finally, 
well, I think it might have been early 70s. Because

08:45.729 --> 08:54.678
in the early 70s, I was the aide to the commanding 
general of the 420th Engineer Brigade, Joe

08:45.729 --> 08:54.678
Hanover. And he was the district highway 
engineer. and there was the practice of taking

08:59.508 --> 09:11.239
every sign that had Austin 28 miles or whatever for 
100 miles and bringing them and putting them on the

08:59.508 --> 09:11.239
bonfire. Well, they finally got mad and said, at 
$25 a sign, or who knows what the cost was, that

09:11.455 --> 09:20.363
needs to stop. So shortly thereafter, students 
agreed to construct the outhouse and to construct

09:21.264 --> 09:30.072
signs that said what they wanted. And the cutting 
area, did they yet use chainsaws at all? There were

09:37.759 --> 09:39.741
a few chainsaws. During your student days, do you 
remember any injuries? I can remember a broken leg

09:46.399 --> 09:49.383
or something like that.

09:52.347 --> 09:53.008
I don't remember any. That's serious, but I don't 
remember any other. How much partying was there in

09:56.172 --> 09:57.874
that era? I don't remember any. I have no recall of 
any of that happening. You mainly were guarding

10:04.443 --> 10:08.510
the campus. See, in those days we guarded every 
single sully, cow field. We had campfires all over

10:15.042 --> 10:18.629
the campus guarding the fish pond. So you just had 
reasons to be up all night for three days. Do you

10:22.246 --> 10:27.053
remember any invaders that attempted to do this? 
Usually if they're my senior year I remember

10:27.073 --> 10:43.495
because I was in charge of that of security and we

10:27.073 --> 10:43.495
chased some kids and the college station police 
helped us and they were high school kids you know

10:27.073 --> 10:43.495
just being crazy but You would get this rumor that 
the Texas fraternity was coming and we would stake

10:43.475 --> 10:52.784
out the road, Highway 60 coming in and stuff. I 
don't know of anything ever happening. During

10:56.288 --> 11:03.455
your student days, were there any Aggie 
kidnappings of Southwest Conference mascots?

11:03.495 --> 11:05.858
When I was a junior, that was the year they took them 
all. The fall of 63. I had some of those in class. Do

11:11.703 --> 11:13.245
you remember any of the reports of that? The one I 
remember is Bevo because we had a practice where at

11:16.748 --> 11:35.371
10, 30, or 11, we would go to Coach Norton's, which 
was a coffee shop, and have coffee and maybe some

11:16.748 --> 11:35.371
pancakes and then come back and either go to bed or 
study. Well, this was a night when I had a test the

11:36.252 --> 11:44.262
next morning, and my intention was to stay up all 
that night, and I had some no-dos. Well, I made a

11:44.950 --> 11:45.932
mistake. I took the no-dose, and then I took the 
coffee. So when we got back to the residence hall,

11:49.678 --> 11:55.047
to the dorm, it was Moore Hall again. We went in the 
room, and the guys started telling stories, and I

11:55.107 --> 12:01.197
talked all night. And the only reason I stopped is 
at about 4.30 or 5 o'clock or sometime, they came in

12:02.319 --> 12:09.731
and said, Bevo is over in the Duncan area. You know, 
let's go. And we did, and I did not do well on that

12:12.018 --> 12:15.224
test. And am I correct in remembering that there 
was no injury damage to Bevo in any way? And is that

12:26.805 --> 12:33.638
the year that when they rented the trailer, they 
signed their... Oh, that's later when they

12:26.805 --> 12:33.638
were... They signed their own names. Yeah, that 
was the fall of 72.

12:40.000 --> 12:46.632
Describe a football, home football game day, game 
day routine. What time did things begin to happen?

12:50.941 --> 12:56.892
I would several times had a date that would come in 
sometime that day. You had the normal practice of

12:57.428 --> 13:03.659
buying the mums, you know, the big maroon and white 
mums. You would go to lunch or breakfast,

13:04.981 --> 13:13.176
whichever was right, in the dining hall. And then 
you'd have the march in and be in the stands and

13:13.156 --> 13:29.176
watch the game and parade around the campus after 
that and go eat and stay where you could and have a

13:13.156 --> 13:29.176
nice time and lose the ball game. And marched in by, 
there was a full corps march in. Just like there is

13:32.901 --> 13:34.963
today. Because see, earlier that, you just went. 
They followed the band, but they didn't, there was

13:38.165 --> 13:41.071
no... Oh, really? No, we had the march-ins in my 
day. The, let's see, and there normally was not a,

13:45.120 --> 13:55.443
if it was a day game, there normally was not a big 
organized Saturday night activity, was there?

13:56.064 --> 13:58.249
Normally not, that I recall. Right. What about a 
court trip? Describe that. Court trips were

14:03.666 --> 14:04.907
interesting. Of course, you got there by whatever 
arrangements you could make. So you had four and

14:08.771 --> 14:16.538
five people in a car or whatever, usually staying 
at buddies' houses. I had three guys where we

14:18.500 --> 14:27.628
stayed at an aunt and uncle's house my senior year 
in the Dallas area. The Mother's Clubs did host

14:27.608 --> 14:37.263
Friday night dances in a major convention center, 
an easy place to get to. And a lot of people would go

14:37.303 --> 14:46.316
to TWU and get dates and then come back for that 
dance and then carry them back to TWU. And then

14:46.977 --> 14:50.663
Saturday morning, fairly early, 9 or 10 o'clock, 
You would have the parade in the downtown of that

14:51.166 --> 15:00.035
city, and then the game in the afternoon. Did you 
make most of the court trips? Made them all, as far

15:02.418 --> 15:04.260
as I recall. Was there a favorite and a least 
favorite of the four places? I don't recall that

15:11.127 --> 15:13.310
being the case. Do you remember any rudeness or 
meanness of the local folks in any of the four

15:13.510 --> 15:19.476
cities? No. Houston, Fort Worth, Dallas, and 
Austin. There were probably more catcalls in

15:23.582 --> 15:33.508
Austin because you had a little broader, but I 
don't remember any.

15:34.990 --> 15:38.934
I've heard stories about beast buckets and moose 
pots. I've heard those stories.

15:44.099 --> 15:51.167
Basically, some kind of bedding system that would 
relate to the quality of the dates, be they male or

15:44.099 --> 15:51.167
female. Did you and your buddies write letters to 
TWU? We did, to your PO box. That's what I've heard.

16:02.198 --> 16:03.259
The same number. Did you ever do that? I did it. I 
don't remember anything coming out of it. You

16:08.192 --> 16:08.933
don't remember a date? I don't remember a connect. 
Oh, okay. But I remember doing it. And they would

16:12.798 --> 16:16.443
come down here on the train? Well, old days, but 
they would come on buses and cars in the 60s. And

16:23.352 --> 16:25.335
stay everywhere? Stay everywhere. They would 
even clear out some dorm space, I think, and make

16:28.178 --> 16:32.044
room for them. How were the girls treated? I think 
very well. I've never heard anything but positive

16:37.182 --> 16:41.928
that they kind of felt like they were royalty. 
Yeah. Were the big spring dances still going on?

16:45.973 --> 16:46.494
Yes, they were. Fish ball, sophomore ball, junior 
ball. Cotton ball. Boot dance, cotton ball. Boot

16:52.361 --> 16:52.902
dance. All happening. Was there one that was 
notably bigger?

17:00.901 --> 17:03.424
I think they were all fairly same size. I mean, they 
were all pretty big. They were mostly in Sebesa

17:05.407 --> 17:07.269
Dining Hall. The combat bash was big, and you had a 
lot of extra people, a lot of military people,

17:08.230 --> 17:16.721
because it was on military weekend. And it was 
usually in Duncan Dining Hall. And then the

17:21.687 --> 17:27.634
military ball was more formal and was in Sebesa 
Dining Hall. And in those days, they would have

17:27.952 --> 17:37.567
seven or eight general officers here as part of the 
festivities during that weekend, and they would

17:27.952 --> 17:37.567
all parade in and parade out. And what was the 
behavior pattern for those? Polite.

17:46.441 --> 17:47.062
Straightforward. Did you ever hitchhike? I 
wasn't much on hitchhiking. I did some. And it was

17:54.479 --> 17:57.444
still happening when I first came back. It 
probably stopped in the very early 70s is when it

17:57.744 --> 18:02.712
pretty much dried up. But I would stop at the known 
spot in Houston when I was coming back. Where was

18:07.600 --> 18:08.200
it? From home. It was on 290 on Hempstead Road. I 
don't remember the exact location. This side of

18:17.114 --> 18:20.740
what is now the 610 loop? No, it would have been on 
the, oh, 610. Yeah, it would have been out

18:25.603 --> 18:29.010
Hempstead out of 610. Okay. But not as far out as the 
new Beltway 8. Yeah. Did you ever hear of any

18:37.807 --> 18:40.112
negative? Any Aggie that had a negative hitchhike 
experience? I haven't. I haven't yet heard of any.

18:46.464 --> 18:53.815
And everyone emphasizes that there was, that rank 
did not matter when you were hitchhiking. You took

18:53.896 --> 18:54.497
your turn. Who was first. Who was first. And that in 
most of the big cities, there was a fairly known

18:57.121 --> 19:05.154
place that you went to, and you never held a sign up. 
You just had on your uniform and your thumb. Yeah,

19:07.852 --> 19:16.925
and they didn't all have uniforms on, you know, 
when I, in about 70, 69 and 70, when I was picking

19:07.852 --> 19:16.925
people up. When you were an undergraduate, what 
were the most notable, and I'm using that word to

19:17.205 --> 19:25.357
mean most respected, student organizations? If I 
wanted prestige, what organizations would I have

19:25.497 --> 19:30.805
tried to join? Well, remember I had a very heavy 
Corps connection, so you would say the Ross

19:32.759 --> 19:38.346
Volunteers. I think that the MSC Council had a very 
positive influence. Student government by

19:48.219 --> 19:55.007
today's standards was teeny, but you still knew 
who some of those people were. Corps

19:55.027 --> 19:59.593
Commander. Yeah, if you named individuals, a core 
commander, student body president, head Yale

20:00.012 --> 20:05.858
leader. Yale leaders were all known individuals, 
clearly a student leader. Lots of leadership

20:12.544 --> 20:18.930
positions belong to the head Yale leader that have 
evolved into other things. Bonfire orientation

20:20.352 --> 20:26.998
programs, muster, all of those are separate 
groups now. Were you aware in that era of any secret

20:29.459 --> 20:34.046
fraternities? I wasn't aware of any. I've read 
everything about them in the last number of years,

20:36.750 --> 20:49.189
but it wasn't something that I knew about.

20:54.333 --> 20:54.894
Let's see. Brownfield had long ceased. Right. 
Let's see. Did you have a car? I didn't have a car.

21:03.508 --> 21:04.149
Never had a car. How'd you get around? Friends. 
Rode the bus. How often would you go to and from

21:09.818 --> 21:12.141
Houston?

21:15.066 --> 21:16.408
Two or three times a semester. And just for the 
weekend. Usually the weekend. You would go

21:22.544 --> 21:24.467
because of a court trip. You would go because of 
football games with people. You went by bus more

21:27.591 --> 21:29.413
often than train? Never went by train. The train 
was pretty much not operating at that stage. And

21:35.400 --> 21:37.262
about two hours? The 60s. Yeah, it was a little over 
two hours. It was cheap. Did you as a student have

21:43.982 --> 21:47.448
any interaction with the local community? Did you 
go to church or anything off campus? Went to the

21:50.093 --> 21:58.929
A&M, you know, the College Station Baptist, First 
Baptist. Particularly my freshman year was not,

21:59.029 --> 22:06.763
I'd been active through high school and 
elementary, but I wasn't very active. Was

22:08.802 --> 22:10.765
religious emphasis week? Still happening. And 
what was it like for a student? All I remember is all

22:15.413 --> 22:24.668
of the organizations that had an orientation in 
that way, you know, had exposure, and if you wanted

22:15.413 --> 22:24.668
to have a level of involvement, you could. In

22:24.708 --> 22:30.017
the summer, you went to Camp... I went to summer 
school. Of course, one summer was part of being

22:35.177 --> 22:37.420
laid out. At the end of my sophomore year, I stayed 
in summer school. End of my junior year, I stayed in

22:44.351 --> 22:46.534
summer school. And then my senior year is when I 
went to camp after I graduated. So that A&M didn't

22:54.145 --> 23:04.516
play any important role in helping you get a summer 
job or post-graduate experiences or anything

22:54.145 --> 23:04.516
like that? No, remember I was only intending to be 
commissioned. All right, let's see. We've talked

23:09.401 --> 23:12.745
about court trips and student and game day.

23:16.349 --> 23:19.512
What was final review like, particularly for a 
senior? I think final review was pretty solemn.

23:25.684 --> 23:31.694
People had just been commissioned and graduation 
had taken place, lots of families. It was in early

23:32.675 --> 23:35.880
June, so it was hotter than the blue blazes. I mean, 
it was very hot. You were already felt like you felt

23:40.408 --> 23:43.693
kind of removed. You felt like it was over. You were 
essentially ready to go. It's time to move on and do

23:49.503 --> 23:53.434
something else. But pretty teary eyed. It didn't 
take very long to change. The time between the

24:03.077 --> 24:07.444
first review and the second review I don't think 
was very long. There was very little monkey

24:08.145 --> 24:11.911
business that took place. You just kind of marched 
across and you became the reviewing party. That

24:17.761 --> 24:25.950
got out of hand in the late 70s and through some of 
the 80s and it just became a circus. And the Corps

24:26.951 --> 24:40.246
has really done a good job of cleaning that up here 
in the last five or six years where I think it has a

24:26.951 --> 24:40.246
serious resemblance to the way it was in the past. 
It's very orderly and very emotional. I think the

24:44.310 --> 24:46.873
emotion is higher Much higher. Held on the drill 
field. It's still held on the drill field. Only

24:53.702 --> 25:00.270
time it wasn't is there was about a three-year 
period where Simpson Drill Field was being major

24:53.702 --> 25:00.270
re-sodded.

25:02.573 --> 25:08.221
And do you remember who some of the reviewing 
officers, were they important? I don't remember

25:09.002 --> 25:10.343
when I was a student. I don't remember any of them. 
How did you feel when you put on those senior boots

25:13.533 --> 25:20.021
officially the first time? Felt pretty good. That 
pour down rain at the end of that, all during that

25:22.021 --> 25:31.835
final review, just absolute quagmire.

25:33.157 --> 25:34.839
Big smiles.

25:36.622 --> 25:37.443
Mother came to that. Mother. Reese was still here 
on the staff, but mother and grandma. Okay. All

25:45.853 --> 25:47.235
right, then commencement. Describe it. 
Commencement, it was a full miracle that I

25:48.015 --> 25:56.824
graduated, and so 37 members of my family came to 
graduation. Mother made arrangements for the

25:58.706 --> 26:12.480
buffet at the Ramada Inn at, I think, $5 a head, and 
they

25:58.706 --> 26:12.480
all ended up on the, side of G. Raleigh on the west 
side and there was a photo taken of the stage and of

26:12.713 --> 26:24.714
that side and my entire family is in the photo in the 
yearbook. Grandma, aunts, uncles, cousins. I was

26:30.384 --> 26:33.209
the first to graduate from a college. Do you 
remember who the speaker was? I have no idea.

26:37.958 --> 26:46.070
Almost no one, and whenever I make a commencement 
speech, I always indicate that I'm aware no one has

26:37.958 --> 26:46.070
come to hear the speaker. They've come to see a 
certain person walk across the stage. That's the

26:49.796 --> 26:51.418
reason they're there. But your name was called and 
pronounced correctly. Right. And your hand was

26:58.850 --> 26:59.971
shaken. And how long did it take you to look into the 
tube? I probably looked pretty fast. I'm

27:07.962 --> 27:16.318
convinced that's one of the very, very, very quiet 
important traditions. Yeah, but to still do it.

27:17.581 --> 27:17.861
Yes. With, you know, 4,000 some odd graduating 
here in three ceremonies, you know, in a week. It's

27:25.275 --> 27:28.722
just, it's so wonderful, but it's very 
extraordinary. And almost every other

27:28.702 --> 27:33.088
institution I know of in the country has long 
ago... Given up on it. Given up and, you know, I

27:34.210 --> 27:40.299
hereby, therefore, will mail it to you and so no one 
attends. It's awesome. Yes. And I've, of course,

27:41.280 --> 27:49.392
the last seven years I've been on the stage and for 
all three ceremonies and it's amazing how fast

27:41.280 --> 27:49.392
they go. And I'm, I don't make a pre-list. I just try 
to be alert. And so I, I don't know how many people I

27:55.752 --> 27:58.896
shake hands with, but a pretty big number. And you 
have the ability to do that. And it's really cool.

28:04.343 --> 28:04.964
It's really neat. One of my favorite anecdotes 
involved the messages that some students put on

28:05.225 --> 28:10.612
their morgue. Yeah, we're all looking for those. 
All right, my favorite one was about 25 years ago.

28:17.200 --> 28:21.246
One young lad put on his, hell froze over. Yeah, I 
can relate to that one. Your first silver taps, do

28:26.498 --> 28:28.520
you remember that? I remember going as a freshman. 
You had to completely, everything was turned off.

28:37.868 --> 28:45.776
We were still small, so there was an attempt to turn 
everything off, not just in the central academic

28:37.868 --> 28:45.776
area. And we could stay up and study when we went 
back, but you had to have a blanket tucked into the

28:46.637 --> 28:54.784
window where there wasn't the slightest chance of 
light getting out the window. Very orderly, very

28:58.457 --> 29:02.341
quiet, very impressive. Did it seem meaningful to 
you? Very meaningful. It's never lost it. Did you

29:09.029 --> 29:13.755
have the impression that it was just like it had 
been for many, many years? Yes. All right. What

29:16.178 --> 29:17.059
about muster? Did you go to muster? Yes. It was on 
the lawn of the MSC one year. It was on the lawn of the

29:23.958 --> 29:28.745
administration building, like one near.

29:32.250 --> 29:34.293
I have good memories. I don't remember them being 
too terribly long. I don't remember any speakers.

29:43.125 --> 29:51.417
But the ceremony and the impact of the firing squad 
and the roll call and everything is a very strong

29:43.125 --> 29:51.417
memory. As you were getting ready to leave the 
campus as a graduating senior, how well prepared

29:52.477 --> 30:01.809
did you feel A&M had made you?

30:04.732 --> 30:17.809
I felt fine and fully prepared to be an army officer 
and thought that I would do okay and did okay. If you

30:18.211 --> 30:32.047
could today line up all of the people that you now 
know had a positive effect on your career from

30:18.211 --> 30:32.047
those undergraduate days, who would you most want 
to? Well, I've named most of them already. It

30:37.714 --> 30:44.742
wasn't a huge list, but mother has an impact, 
grandma has an impact, The ants sending brownies

30:45.380 --> 30:48.865
when you're a fish has an impact. Aunt Ruth's 
brownies were the best brownies in the world. And

30:52.390 --> 30:56.135
when you show up with a shoebox, there's a real clue 
what this is. And so all of a sudden, you were a

30:56.596 --> 30:59.840
really nice guy.

31:03.646 --> 31:05.969
Calvin Reese played a very important point. Dan 
Lowe played an important point. George Rice.

31:11.156 --> 31:15.302
There were people that stepped up when they were 
given the opportunity. Hannigan was very nice

31:16.582 --> 31:22.135
every time I had anything to do with him, very 
supportive. He knew that I was just as mediocre a

31:23.298 --> 31:29.393
student as I was.
