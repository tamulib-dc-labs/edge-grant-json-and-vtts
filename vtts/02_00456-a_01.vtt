00:06.022 --> 00:23.693
This is an interview with Lonnie Doggett by Ruth 
Ann Kirtland on December the 5th at Giddings,

00:06.022 --> 00:23.693
Texas, concerning his tour of duty in Vietnam and 
his feelings about Vietnam, the Vietnam War. In

00:24.922 --> 00:33.952
the interest of accumulating knowledge, I am 
asking him to donate this tape to me or to the Texas

00:24.922 --> 00:33.952
A&M oral history collection in the university 
archives. And he has agreed to this. Have you not?

00:36.635 --> 00:38.837
Yes. Could you tell me where you were born and what 
your birth date is? I was born in Ballinger, Texas

00:42.040 --> 00:46.766
on August 31, 1944.

00:49.769 --> 00:51.511
And what's your education? Two years of college at 
Angelo State University. And what was your degree

00:55.347 --> 00:57.589
you were pursuing? Agricultural. And what's your 
profession now? My profession is I'm a drilling

01:02.835 --> 01:05.137
fluids engineer.

01:08.501 --> 01:09.903
Have you been in the oil business very long? About 
12 years. That's long. It's quite long. Okay, what

01:15.829 --> 01:19.012
branch of the service were you in? United States 
Air Force. And how long were you in the United

01:21.135 --> 01:23.717
States Air Force? Four years. What rank were you in 
the Air Force? I was a buck sergeant. Air Force?

01:34.359 --> 01:34.499
Mm-hmm. What did you do in the Air Force? I was a 
military policeman. Isn't that called a security

01:41.828 --> 01:43.290
policeman? Security policeman. Is that what they 
called them then, or...? Well, they still call

01:47.137 --> 01:48.279
them that. They're all military police. They're 
security police in the Air Force. Mm-hmm. Were you

01:53.948 --> 01:57.333
on the security side or the defense side, or didn't 
they have them separated? No, they didn't have

01:58.134 --> 02:01.800
them separated. Okay. What year did you go to 
Vietnam? I went in December of 1966. And how long

02:08.851 --> 02:09.652
were you there? A year. The normal tour, did it? 
Mm-hmm. Could you tell me briefly what your duties

02:13.445 --> 02:20.435
were as a security policeman? We were assigned to 
protect a base in South Vietnam. It was our duty to

02:26.683 --> 02:35.375
protect that base, which was Ponsonute Air Force 
Base, and we were assigned to protect it. Did you

02:35.836 --> 02:40.262
have any contact with the Arvin while you were 
there? Could you give me your opinion of the

02:40.732 --> 02:47.880
effectiveness of the Arvin or whether they were 
ineffective? The Arvin was, they were effective

02:48.641 --> 02:52.445
with what they had. They were very effective. You 
know, I don't know just exactly what you're

02:55.688 --> 03:05.339
saying, but the effectiveness that they had, I 
mean, they could do with whatever they had. They

03:05.419 --> 03:06.741
could do with modern weapons. They could do with 
primitive weapons and do a good job. Well, when

03:12.659 --> 03:23.368
they sent the advisors over to Vietnam, they were 
supposed to be training the Arvin, is the way I

03:12.659 --> 03:23.368
understand it. And this is why I ask you the 
question, if they were affected, did the training

03:23.468 --> 03:28.963
do them any good, or do you feel that it was just 
their natural talents, the natural ability that

03:29.433 --> 03:34.178
they had as Vietnamese in the country. You're 
talking basically about the South Vietnamese

03:34.198 --> 03:37.040
soldiers. Yes. We were fighting the North 
Vietnamese. Right. Well, the South Vietnamese

03:40.864 --> 03:55.718
were basically good soldiers, but they didn't 
have the discipline that American soldiers had,

03:40.864 --> 03:55.718
and that caused them a lot of times to fail in what 
they did. Could you expand on that a little?

03:59.740 --> 04:08.772
Discipline by meaning American troops or 
American forces in the past have had so much

03:59.740 --> 04:08.772
discipline. Even in Vietnam, even though you're 
in a wartime situation, the discipline still is

04:08.852 --> 04:22.169
expressed in every phase, all the way down to 
you're still supposed to wear a uniform, right?

04:22.209 --> 04:22.650
That's right. Different things like that. And 
you're still policed. You're still told how to act

04:27.622 --> 04:31.046
and how to do. And the RVAN didn't really have the 
discipline that we had. And I think that's the

04:36.931 --> 04:45.700
reason American forces are as good fighters as 
they are, is because of the discipline that they

04:36.931 --> 04:45.700
had. They recognized leadership. And the RVAN 
didn't recognize leadership as much as, they just

04:48.262 --> 04:55.009
weren't as good a soldier as the American 
soldiers. Did you come in contact with any of the

04:56.356 --> 04:59.701
helicopter pilots? Oh, yeah. Yes. Did you happen 
to meet any of the Arvin helicopter pilots? No.

05:08.615 --> 05:09.977
Just American helicopter pilots. What was your 
feelings about the American helicopter pilots

05:09.997 --> 05:14.624
and where they did their job? I thought they were 
unbelievably good. They were outstanding. Did

05:22.175 --> 05:25.300
you go out into combat, or did you just stay at the 
Air Force base there? No, we were involved in

05:25.651 --> 05:28.834
combat. Another thing, too, you know, that people 
don't seem to understand, in Vietnam there's no

05:30.015 --> 05:37.442
such thing as going to the front. There was no 
front. I mean, if you were on Vietnamese soil, you

05:39.845 --> 05:44.129
were in a combat zone. It didn't make any 
difference if you was in the streets in Saigon or if

05:45.130 --> 05:52.637
you were in the jungles around Tui Hoa or 
somewhere. You were in a combat zone in every

05:53.123 --> 05:55.666
situation. You were never out of a combat zone if 
you were in Vietnam. So, you know, like us, even

06:01.092 --> 06:08.440
though we were on a base, we had 26 miles of 
perimeter to cover. Over half of that perimeter

06:08.460 --> 06:12.364
was in the jungle. So, you know, you could be inside 
the base and not be in a safe situation. In the first

06:18.531 --> 06:20.754
place, the base belonged to the Vietnamese. It 
didn't belong to the Americans. So we were just

06:23.785 --> 06:25.568
visitors there. We were. When we landed in 
Vietnam, as soon as we got off the aircraft, we were

06:26.068 --> 06:36.743
told that we were guests in Vietnam and remember 
that we were guests. Why do you think they told you

06:38.286 --> 06:39.387
that? I don't know. They didn't explain it. They 
just said that. They just told us. They said that

06:46.557 --> 06:48.821
too. It meant what they, you know, what it implied, 
that we were guests. Did the Air Force ever go out

06:52.287 --> 06:56.733
into the fields? Sure.

07:01.059 --> 07:06.506
The Air Force probably has maybe not as many combat 
troops as the others. But the military, one thing,

07:08.989 --> 07:20.725
your role in Vietnam didn't mean whatever you were 
trained for in the United States didn't mean that

07:08.989 --> 07:20.725
that's what you were going to do while you were in 
Vietnam. If you were at FUCAT or TUIWA and you were

07:21.818 --> 07:33.314
in the Air Force Security Police, your job was to 
set up ambushes outside the perimeter. A job you

07:33.334 --> 07:39.623
really wasn't trained to do, but a lot of people 
wasn't trained to do a lot of things they did. All of

07:40.224 --> 07:48.315
us in the Security Police went to combat school 
before we went overseas, but you were involved

07:48.953 --> 07:51.896
Like I said, we protected the base where we were at. 
There was no one at us, just us. And so we were

07:54.579 --> 07:58.884
charged with providing security for the 
perimeter. We were to protect it against all

07:58.904 --> 08:05.552
aggression or whatever it was or wherever it came. 
So you ought to be, and also we had to cover things

08:05.572 --> 08:14.202
that happened, aerial accidents in the jungle and 
that sort of thing. Those were, we were charged

08:14.302 --> 08:17.345
with covering those. What do you mean by charged 
with? It was your duty. You were called upon to do

08:20.206 --> 08:21.447
it. What did this consist of? Well, for instance, 
one time we had an F-4 Phantom and another

08:23.909 --> 08:34.859
Australian aircraft that collided in midair and 
they crashed in the jungle. Those aircraft had to

08:35.920 --> 08:42.006
be secured to keep the enemy from taking what was on 
and off. So they took like a hundred of us and sent us

08:42.026 --> 08:47.631
into the jungle to secure that... that crash sign 
until they got off what they wanted off of them.

08:57.195 --> 09:05.130
That particular one, they would pick so many men to 
go and you went and you were given You know, you took

09:05.431 --> 09:08.416
whatever weapons you were supposed to. Some 
people had machine gun M60s, some people had

09:08.437 --> 09:14.027
grenade launchers, some people had M16s. And you 
went into that area and we stayed two or three days

09:14.047 --> 09:20.358
in max. And, you know, at that time, in that 
particular one, it was during the monsoons, so the

09:21.561 --> 09:28.333
rains were heavy. You were in the rice paddies. So 
you secured a, you know, it was pitch dark because

09:31.975 --> 09:44.972
of the rain and the air support that you were 
supposed to have that dropped illumination

09:31.975 --> 09:44.972
flares at night to light up the area never showed. 
And so you lay out there on the dikes and the rice

09:46.213 --> 09:53.383
paddies and try to protect that grass side. The 
only problem is, is the Vietnamese, the village

09:53.403 --> 09:57.308
where we were at, Those people knew they hated us. 
And because they knew when we left, the VC would

10:02.633 --> 10:08.280
come in and kill them all. If we commandeered the 
barns and whatnot, the radio setups and whatnot.

10:13.887 --> 10:14.748
Well, why did they know? Why would the VC come in and 
kill them in the village because you had been

10:14.929 --> 10:18.113
there? Because Americans had been there. Is this 
standard? Sure. Who ordered it? The VC did it? Did

10:28.140 --> 10:31.623
that mean that the people did not want to cooperate 
with you? Oh, yeah. They didn't want us there at

10:32.624 --> 10:34.285
all. But we didn't have any choice. We had to be 
there. I mean, what a crash site there. It had to be

10:39.290 --> 10:41.512
taken care of. How did you feel about this? Well, I 
didn't want people to be slaughtered, but I think

10:45.195 --> 10:53.242
we should have been there. I think we had to be 
there. Were you in any other villages in the course

10:54.460 --> 10:59.147
of your duties? I was in other villages, not for the 
same thing. Traveling through them, taking

11:02.272 --> 11:04.856
prisoners through them. Did they get 
slaughtered, killed by the V.C. after they went in

11:07.980 --> 11:08.581
there? No. It was just because of that crash of the 
Phantom? Yeah. Most of them were... Villages like

11:14.440 --> 11:19.485
that were jungle villages, you know, out off of the 
roads and stuff. Small villages with a small

11:19.505 --> 11:23.949
amount of people. But the V.C. would always, you 
know, if they came in after us. But you knew they did

11:27.872 --> 11:30.435
because they watched you all the time you were 
there. How did you feel about knowing that they

11:30.455 --> 11:34.298
were watching you all the time? Well, it's not a 
good feeling, but, you know, it's something to

11:34.318 --> 11:39.763
begin with. You know, when you arrive in Vietnam, 
or when I did, You know, you see all the movies and

11:44.900 --> 11:51.129
you read all the books about war, but it's not the 
same as when you really get there. And when you

11:53.012 --> 11:58.059
really get there, when I got there, you know, 
you're afraid. You're really scared for your

11:58.099 --> 12:00.522
life. You feel like that you, you know, you may die. 
Then you're, you know, you're really scared for

12:07.192 --> 12:11.919
probably like a couple of months. And then after 
that couple of months, then you're not afraid

12:12.440 --> 12:16.386
anymore. You're afraid, but they've been 
bothering you anymore. So you learn to accept, you

12:20.813 --> 12:25.120
know, the environment. Just like, I guess, going 
to a new job or something. After a while, you get to

12:28.886 --> 12:33.794
where you kind of just grow something, you know. 
And the war did that. And then when You got close to

12:36.352 --> 12:43.461
going home, you started getting scared again 
because you knew you were going back home. So the

12:43.481 --> 12:48.127
reality of losing your life came back. You worried 
about something happening to you before you got

12:50.130 --> 12:54.976
the chance to go back home. How did you feel about 
the Vietnamese one, the South Vietnamese? I had a

13:01.224 --> 13:05.029
very poor opinion of the Vietnamese, the South 
Vietnamese. Low opinion. In what way? Well, in the

13:07.688 --> 13:11.773
first place, we were not treated. Security 
policemen had a five piastre bounty on them. If you

13:18.221 --> 13:21.104
kill a security policeman, then you got five 
dollars. Oh. So, you know, the bounty on the

13:23.287 --> 13:29.715
security police, you know, we weren't real 
important when we got down to it. But, you know, a

13:29.735 --> 13:31.998
pilot had a bounty on him. An officer had a bounty on 
him. And the South Vietnamese didn't treat us real

13:35.060 --> 13:39.847
well at all. We worked jointly with the QCs, which 
were the Quang Cong, and that was Premier Ky's

13:42.171 --> 13:50.603
number one people. They were Vietnamese military 
policemen. These were the trainings, weren't

13:53.828 --> 13:57.694
they, that came in the United States at Michigan 
State, I believe? Well, I don't know. They were a

13:59.036 --> 14:00.978
training in the United States. They were Quang 
Cong. They were killers. They were ruthless.

14:08.372 --> 14:14.558
Every evening, we worked at night all the time. And 
every night when we went on duty at guard mount,

14:14.578 --> 14:32.556
they would give us a security or intelligence 
report and tell us what the conditions of the

14:14.578 --> 14:32.556
perimeter was if we were in a grade two possible 
attack or whatever. The one thing that they always

14:33.683 --> 14:44.495
told us, if we were to come under attack, to make 
sure that the Quanton were in front of us and never

14:33.683 --> 14:44.495
got behind us, because they couldn't be trusted. 
In other words, they were saying that the

14:44.515 --> 14:47.238
Quanton... They would shoot you. That they would 
shoot you? Yeah. So... Why do you think they would

14:50.442 --> 14:52.764
do that? Because some of them were loyal to the 
NARC. Even though they were accused people, they

14:56.429 --> 14:58.891
were loyal to the NARC. There was lots of people 
that were loyal to the NARC. This must have been

15:01.477 --> 15:07.983
very frustrating, not being able to tell who was 
North and who was South, because they all looked

15:01.477 --> 15:07.983
alike. Half of the guys that we worked with, the 
Vietnamese military police, were born in Hanoi.

15:14.969 --> 15:16.230
They weren't even from the South. They were 
brought down by the... The families were still

15:18.252 --> 15:23.997
living in Hanoi, in the north. So, you know, it made 
you kind of edgy when you were with these guys. A lot

15:30.082 --> 15:30.943
of times, They had a Vietnamese workforce that 
came in at night, like at 10 or 11 o'clock at night,

15:31.328 --> 15:40.418
maybe a little later. And they were unloaded at the 
gate, and all of them had come in and worked through

15:41.739 --> 15:47.806
the night, civilians. We could tell when we were 
going to be hit because those people wouldn't show

15:49.067 --> 15:52.631
up. They all knew when we were going to be attacked. 
Wouldn't that have been an advantage to the

15:57.897 --> 16:00.880
Americans? knowing that. The only problem is, 
instead of knowing it 24 hours ahead of time, you

16:02.218 --> 16:10.093
knew it maybe two hours ahead of time. Well, did the 
officers act on this once they realized it, or did

16:10.968 --> 16:14.932
they just ignore it? Oh, yeah, we always prepared. 
Well, I'm talking about the officers. The

16:18.375 --> 16:22.820
officers, you know, they're the bosses. And 
there's been a lot of talk about the colonels, that

16:23.140 --> 16:29.346
people were out there working on careerism. Do you 
understand what I mean when I say careerism? Sure.

16:32.610 --> 16:34.452
Did you find that... I saw officers get decorated 
for things that never happened. You know, that

16:40.437 --> 16:40.958
was... I mean, I didn't see it all the time, but it 
happened real frequent. In one instance, I saw a

16:47.017 --> 16:53.284
major get decorated for killing an enemy that a 
friend of mine killed. And he didn't get in. He got a

16:55.527 --> 16:56.528
purple heart. But he didn't get any credit for the 
kills, but the major did. You know, things like

17:03.236 --> 17:08.001
that happen. But the way... A lot of times if there 
was, like I was saying about the attack, if there

17:09.372 --> 17:17.742
was an attack, the QCs would know, but they 
wouldn't tell us. And they would be running around

17:19.344 --> 17:21.046
everywhere. That's the way we'd know. They'd be 
excited and nervous and trying to prepare, and we

17:22.608 --> 17:30.418
would know something was up. Well, didn't it occur 
to the officers after a little while that when

17:30.905 --> 17:37.614
those people didn't show up at 10 o'clock that 
there might be something? Oh, yeah, we all knew

17:37.895 --> 17:38.916
that. As soon as we saw it, we'd notify 
headquarters. Immediately we'd go into combat

17:42.341 --> 17:50.012
preparation and be ready for anything. What did 
your combat readiness consist of? That would mean

17:55.800 --> 18:00.827
deploying troops on the perimeters, covering 
air, our important areas covering those making

18:01.128 --> 18:29.076
sure that we were protected and all which we were 
usually anyway what were you protected with what

18:01.128 --> 18:29.076
kind of equipment what kind of conventional 
weapons conventional weapons and these ones i've

18:01.128 --> 18:29.076
heard they weren't too too successful against the 
dc well yeah our weapons were affected the m16 The

18:30.136 --> 18:35.785
M60, I don't think there was any better machine gun 
than the M60 machine gun. So they really were

18:35.805 --> 18:38.329
effective against them. Weapons, yeah, they

18:38.349 --> 18:42.716
were effective. You could do a real nice job with an 
M60 machine gun, an M16. Now, we had problems with

18:48.446 --> 18:50.930
them to begin with. The M16 was bad about jamming.

18:55.752 --> 19:04.131
The only problem with that is the M16, you can't 
unjam an M16 like you can a bolt-action rifle. A

19:04.151 --> 19:09.803
regular bolt-action rifle, you can take your 
knife out or something and pull the case out of the

19:04.151 --> 19:09.803
barrel. You can't do that on the M16. So what'd you 
do? You threw it away. Threw the weapon away. Threw

19:16.730 --> 19:19.855
it away or got you another one or whatever you had to 
do. So they started issuing rods with them. It was

19:24.022 --> 19:26.165
kind of primitive. But it was nice to have if you 
needed to get a gun. So they issued rods with them,

19:30.652 --> 19:35.099
and then we had some more problems with them. But 
all in all, it was an ammunition problem, and it

19:35.119 --> 19:41.149
was, I think, somewhat taken care of. First M16 I 
had when I was there jammed a lot, and then I traded

19:41.635 --> 19:51.068
it for another M16, and I got good results out of it. 
Sometimes you just get a bad one. When did you get

19:54.032 --> 19:56.335
the jungle boots issued to you? When I got there. So 
they did have them when you got there? We got issued

19:59.800 --> 20:09.253
a set of jungle boots, but we couldn't get fatigues 
or jungle fatigues they didn't have. They didn't

20:09.273 --> 20:10.174
have the camming? Well, we were supposed to have 
them, but they didn't have them. The only thing is

20:15.866 --> 20:20.993
you could go to the black market in Saigon and buy 
anything you wanted to. We couldn't even get

20:21.674 --> 20:26.481
ponchos for the monsoon, reindeer. You couldn't 
buy underwear. You couldn't buy it. It was

20:29.445 --> 20:30.566
supposed to be issued. You had to ask, you know, if 
you needed things like that, you rode home and

20:32.169 --> 20:38.878
someone would send you whatever you needed. Are 
you saying that they didn't even have any ponchos

20:39.398 --> 20:44.445
that you had to buy them on the black market? Right. 
How much did they cost you on them? It just depended

20:46.407 --> 20:49.812
on where and who you bought them from. 
Approximately. Well, you could buy one for $20.

20:51.955 --> 20:55.119
American money, no doubt. No. See, you weren't 
allowed American money in Vietnam. You only had

20:59.104 --> 21:00.927
military pay certificates. If you got caught with 
American money, you went to jail. Why was this? to

21:07.242 --> 21:16.099
protect the currency in the United States, not 
have it depreciated. Go ahead. So they had the

21:17.321 --> 21:27.240
camouflage fatigues there on the black market, 
but the United States government did not have an

21:17.321 --> 21:27.240
issue to you at that time. This was in 1966. You 
could get anything, military, lots of things, on

21:29.720 --> 21:38.268
the black market that you couldn't get from our 
suppliers. Well, they didn't even have them in the

21:38.548 --> 21:43.353
United States at that time for the military, for 
the security police. They didn't have them until

21:43.373 --> 21:44.594
later on. See, even Jeeps. For the first six 
months, we ate sea rations. That's all we had to

21:52.041 --> 21:54.483
eat. I lost 40 pounds in six months when I got there. 
I wasn't hungry, but, you know, didn't have

21:58.475 --> 22:02.342
anything to eat. We ate sea rations, we ate them 
once a day. Every can of sea rations we had was made

22:05.187 --> 22:07.931
in 1947. 1947?

22:11.337 --> 22:13.181
It must have tasted lovely. Well, it's canned, you 
know. Well, how come you only got fed once a day?

22:17.965 --> 22:20.971
It's just the only time we ate was once a day. Didn't 
you get kind of hungry other times a little? Yeah,

22:23.395 --> 22:27.843
you could find, I ate lots of monkey meat when I was 
there. Monkey meat? What did that taste like?

22:29.687 --> 22:31.510
Well, then it tasted pretty good. I don't know what 
it tastes like now, but it tasted fairly good then.

22:36.393 --> 22:38.155
So, but they ate lots of monkeys. And so you'd have a 
Vietnamese guard to get you a monkey sandwich.

22:45.004 --> 22:53.615
Well, when did they start, got it, long before 
this, they're supposed to have had good meals

22:45.004 --> 22:53.615
served on the bases. Well, we didn't have any chow 
halls or anything. There's the, the... We did

22:57.921 --> 22:59.583
later on. ...papaganda. that's put out before 
this. They said you had that before that. Right.

23:05.603 --> 23:07.045
Sometime before that. The field troops, the 
combat troops that were mobile would come through

23:07.065 --> 23:14.235
sometimes. Well, like anybody, the infantry or 
whoever it was. And they would have cases of steaks

23:19.362 --> 23:29.215
that they couldn't cook because they didn't stop 
long enough to cook them. But they couldn't get

23:29.735 --> 23:32.559
C-rations. And we could get all the C-rations we 
wanted, but we couldn't buy a stake anywhere. So we

23:39.789 --> 23:40.991
would trade. That made sense. Okay, what about 
your commanding officers and the headquarters?

23:47.180 --> 23:50.244
Because obviously it was the headquarters 
command who you were, right? There was 7th Air

23:50.264 --> 23:54.010
Force Headquarters there. Okay. Okay, what about 
their eating? Do they eat the sea rations? You

23:58.727 --> 23:59.448
don't know? Because General Westmoreland said 
that the troops were being fed hot meals at the

24:00.429 --> 24:09.700
bases. I don't have a very high opinion of General 
Westmoreland either. Would you care to expand on

24:12.443 --> 24:15.446
that a little bit? Well, I just, you know, General

24:15.466 --> 24:24.497
Westmoreland was our commander. Everybody's 
commander. But Westmoreland and his command was

24:27.159 --> 24:38.416
lying to the United States about a lot of things 
about Vietnam, as everybody knows by now. They do

24:38.696 --> 24:41.561
know now, but they didn't have... You know, we 
were... I remember in May of 1966, during

24:43.284 --> 24:52.678
Operation Cedar Falls and Junction City, They had 
over 5,000 casualties during that month. The

25:01.249 --> 25:04.353
reason I know that is because all the bodies came 
through in front of us. The choppers brought in the

25:05.494 --> 25:17.128
bodies because they'd bring them in there and put 
them in military caskets and sent them home. And so

25:17.428 --> 25:23.475
we got all of the bodies in because we'd have to 
Transport, they'd have to transport them

25:23.894 --> 25:26.697
through. But they reported like, I don't remember 
now, 100 or 200 casualties for that month. You mean

25:33.145 --> 25:35.408
what General S. Moreland reported? Well, his 
command. His command reported, well, as

25:36.089 --> 25:43.438
commander, whatever they say is his 
responsibility, I'm sure aware. You know, that

25:43.718 --> 25:49.205
was one particular instance that stood out in my 
mind because I remember that so well. One reason I

25:49.466 --> 25:51.488
lost a good friend during that. during that time, 
during those operations. But there was so many

25:56.315 --> 26:05.529
that died and so few that was reported to the 
people. But I knew, of course, that I had a fit, but I

26:05.549 --> 26:14.303
knew we lost that many in that small town. Do you 
think this was a deliberate cover-up on the part of

26:14.323 --> 26:20.132
Westmoreland, or do you think it came from the 
President of the United States? I don't know. I

26:21.910 --> 26:28.076
think it was probably both, because my opinion of 
Lyndon Johnson is not any higher than General

26:21.910 --> 26:28.076
Westmoreland. And he was also the president while 
I was in Vietnam. Yes, I know. And I was a

26:33.121 --> 26:38.486
presidential guard for him when I came back to the 
States. How did you feel about that? I'm going to

26:39.867 --> 26:44.912
deviate just a moment since you brought that up and 
ask you how you felt about that after you had been

26:39.867 --> 26:44.912
there. I didn't feel good at all. That was a job that 
was put upon me. I didn't volunteer for that.

26:50.193 --> 26:53.216
Security police get all kinds of jobs like that. 
So, you know, they had to have a high security

26:53.236 --> 27:00.903
clearance and all that good stuff. No, I didn't 
like it. You know, I did it like I was supposed to do

27:02.305 --> 27:06.469
it, but I didn't like doing it. Were you supposed to 
have gone to Vietnam and done something grand and

27:06.489 --> 27:15.518
glorious over there? I don't know. I didn't see 
him. You didn't see him. Do you know what fragging

27:19.235 --> 27:20.316
is? No.

27:24.380 --> 27:24.640
Okay. Do you have any views on why you think we lost 
the war? I think we lost it because we pulled out. Do

27:34.889 --> 27:36.671
you think we could have won it if we had stayed 
there? Sure. I think we could have won it any time we

27:37.451 --> 27:41.435
wanted to. Why did you make that statement? By 
they, who are you saying? The politicians. It was

27:47.618 --> 27:50.040
very political, no doubt about that. Why did you 
think they didn't want to pull out? They pulled out

27:52.102 --> 27:54.785
instead of letting us win, letting them win. Why 
that we pulled out? Instead of winning the war. If

27:59.209 --> 28:00.770
you think they could have won the war. Well, of 
course, I feel like that, you know, they could have

28:00.810 --> 28:04.654
won it before I ever went. Anytime they wanted to. 
And, you know, you know that. We didn't use half of

28:10.119 --> 28:14.283
the firepower that we had available. You know, we 
didn't use that in Vietnam. Another thing, we

28:17.487 --> 28:24.398
never had went for territorial gain in Vietnam. It 
was all body count type stuff. So, you know, there

28:27.864 --> 28:31.791
wasn't that type of war. I think any time that we had 
wanted to. When I was there, most of the guys you

28:34.735 --> 28:38.702
talked to wanted to fight. They wanted to go 
through and go on and keep going until we swept the

28:39.492 --> 28:45.839
country. And everybody wanted to do that, but you 
couldn't do that. And I think that could have been

28:51.425 --> 28:55.830
done in several months. Why couldn't you? Were you 
not allowed to? No, I wasn't allowed. It wasn't

29:00.275 --> 29:03.819
that kind of fighting. Most everybody was 
assigned to a base. You went out on patrol. If you

29:09.740 --> 29:20.754
were in a reconnaissance group or you were in a 
combat infantry unit, you were sent out each day,

29:09.740 --> 29:20.754
and you might go through the same area every day for 
months. And you didn't report that, well, we went

29:22.356 --> 29:27.542
four miles into the jungle today. You reported 
body counts. Did that disturb you? Sure. Why?

29:34.111 --> 29:37.495
Well, we weren't making any progress. In other 
words, did you safely say that you felt like you

29:38.487 --> 29:44.174
were spinning your wheels? Sure, yeah. Yeah, we 
were. Take ceasefires, for instance. Nobody in

29:50.742 --> 29:53.045
Vietnam wanted a ceasefire. American troops 
didn't want ceasefires. We had a ceasefire for

29:55.849 --> 29:57.271
Christmas. Nobody wanted that. Why not? Because 
the North Vietnamese didn't honor ceasefires. So

30:04.079 --> 30:05.101
you were just sitting there? Sure. What 
happened... Everything you did before that time

30:07.613 --> 30:15.562
that that ceasefire was called, you pushed them 
back so far. Well, they'd call a ceasefire so we

30:17.024 --> 30:21.790
couldn't do anything anymore but watch. We could 
watch. Everybody wanted to watch the enemy or

30:23.312 --> 30:27.877
whatever they were doing. So during that 
ceasefire, nobody was supposed to move, do

30:27.897 --> 30:31.601
anything. They would move all of their arms back 
south again, and we'd watch them. convoys, miles

30:38.056 --> 30:46.307
long, moving ammunition and artillery back into 
the areas where we were. When you immediately,

30:47.148 --> 30:52.275
after the ceasefire was over, we was going to get 
our tails blown off. What you're saying is that the

30:52.295 --> 31:01.247
ceasefire, it was supposed to be arrest and 
recuperation or something like that, but you were

30:52.295 --> 31:01.247
actually setting you up as sitting ducks? I think 
they were doing it for the people in the United

31:01.267 --> 31:04.772
States, not for us. to satisfy that, not to, you 
know, it looked good on paper, in the news. You

31:11.953 --> 31:15.560
know, Christmas ceasefire in Vietnam is a joke. 
Did you, how much of the, what did you, how much did

31:16.321 --> 31:23.474
you know about Vietnam and what was going on in 
there? Just what I saw on TV. Which was what? Well,

31:27.441 --> 31:28.363
you saw some...
