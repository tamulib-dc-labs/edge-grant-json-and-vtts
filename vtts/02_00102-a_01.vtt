00:03.068 --> 00:06.552
Testing, testing, one, two, three, four, testing, testing.

00:09.456 --> 00:14.783
Testing, testing, three, two, one, three, two, one, testing, testing.

00:16.645 --> 00:21.311
Testing, testing, the 25th of July.

00:21.331 --> 00:27.118
19, I mean 2001, I haven't got the century turn yet.

00:29.242 --> 00:30.745
This is July the 25th.

00:31.386 --> 00:39.142
We're here in the Evans Library, and I have the honor and pleasure of chatting with Lynn Hamrick, and I should say Hembrick.

00:39.362 --> 00:40.344
Hembrick, yes.

00:40.785 --> 00:42.188
And it's Jacqueline.

00:42.235 --> 00:45.920
Yes, that's some of the official roles and payrolls, Jacqueline.

00:45.940 --> 00:46.941
But you've always been Lynn?

00:47.081 --> 00:48.383
I've always been Lynn.

00:48.543 --> 00:49.344
L-I-N-N?

00:49.525 --> 00:50.426
L-Y-N-N-E.

00:50.966 --> 00:52.008
L-Y-N-N-E.

00:53.089 --> 00:55.292
Okay, because L-Y-N-N-E.

00:56.233 --> 01:02.902
Okay, to introduce yourself to someone who would hear this tape or read a transcription, describe background.

01:03.283 --> 01:04.344
Where did you grow up?

01:04.404 --> 01:07.448
Where did you go to school as a kid?

01:07.588 --> 01:08.850
What did Mom and Dad do?

01:09.337 --> 01:11.179
Then, where did you go to college?

01:11.920 --> 01:15.485
Bring us up, give us a biographical sketch.

01:16.106 --> 01:18.069
I grew up in a town called North Zulch.

01:18.089 --> 01:21.634
It's about 35 miles from here, kind of east of here on Highway 21.

01:21.914 --> 01:30.906
I went to school at North Zulch, first grade through 12th grade, and there was eight in my senior class.

01:31.578 --> 01:35.471
That's kind of a small rural town.

01:35.571 --> 01:37.578
It was a country town.

01:37.758 --> 01:39.765
What did mom and dad do for a living?

01:39.796 --> 01:46.365
Mother was what's rare these days as a housewife, and she kept the home fires burning.

01:46.425 --> 01:56.099
And Dad worked, we farmed after he got off of his job, daytime job, which was working over here at Bryan at various low-paying jobs.

01:56.240 --> 01:58.843
But, like, he helped build a vet school.

01:59.624 --> 02:01.727
He helped build the old Circle Drive-In Theater.

02:02.428 --> 02:07.035
So he was one of the ones that helped him build a college, even though he...

02:07.015 --> 02:17.148
Wasn't, and A&M was the college at the time, and if I'd ever thought about going to the school over on the other hill, I think I'd have been disowned.

02:17.168 --> 02:18.169
In fact, I know I would.

02:20.051 --> 02:21.653
I remember Daddy coming in one day.

02:21.693 --> 02:23.135
It was a football game.

02:23.155 --> 02:28.121
He'd worked over Thanksgiving, and he came in, and he had the flu, and we all had the flu and everything.

02:28.141 --> 02:31.505
He said, I sure do like old Crow.

02:31.786 --> 02:36.972
I sure do like old Taylor, and a home remedy was

02:37.289 --> 02:55.703
whiskey and lemon juice, hot toddy, and mother knew I was sick, so she said, well, it's over, it's in the bathroom cabinet, go get it, and he kept on, and what he'd done, he'd won a football pot for the Thanksgiving deal, and Old Crow and Taylor were those brands of whiskey, and she thought that's what he was talking about.

02:56.273 --> 03:00.504
But was he talking about Lloyd Taylor and John Crowe?

03:00.524 --> 03:01.046
Right.

03:02.128 --> 03:07.783
I don't remember the score, but he'd put his name in the pot and won the whole pot, and he was so proud.

03:07.804 --> 03:11.413
What kind of encouragement did you get growing up about going to college?

03:11.933 --> 03:14.598
Daddy, they voted me to go to college.

03:14.618 --> 03:18.986
And in order to finance my way through college, I saved dimes.

03:19.307 --> 03:22.553
Thin dimes, or dime dimes, as they're called.

03:22.593 --> 03:24.496
And it's hard for me to spend a dime nowadays.

03:25.638 --> 03:28.744
And I also saved buffalo nickels.

03:28.724 --> 03:42.826
and you don't see those and then I decided I'd save every nickel that I got that had a mint mark on it and I only got 25 cents a week for allowance so if you make those restrictions you may get to spend five cents out of your quarter.

03:43.827 --> 03:55.305
Also when I was born my dad and my mother gave my sister gave me a calf and the increase went one one went to go for

03:55.893 --> 04:01.003
household bills and things that others went into a savings account for college.

04:02.706 --> 04:04.169
All right, so where did you go to school?

04:04.590 --> 04:07.094
I went to Sam Houston State over in Huntsville.

04:07.395 --> 04:08.136
Majored in?

04:08.557 --> 04:14.188
I had a triple major, Library of Science, History, and Education, and I did it in three years.

04:14.428 --> 04:17.213
What did you think you were going to do when you went to college?

04:17.233 --> 04:18.576
I was not going to teach.

04:19.332 --> 04:21.438
I didn't have the patience to be a teacher.

04:21.739 --> 04:32.532
I still don't have the patience to be a teacher, but I enjoyed people, and so I started working in the library as a student, and that's what I decided I was going to do.

04:33.355 --> 04:35.238
And then after Sam Houston?

04:35.519 --> 04:36.440
After Sam Houston?

04:36.460 --> 04:40.607
Well, during the summers when I was at Sam Houston, I worked at Bryan Public Library.

04:40.627 --> 04:43.732
And I did everything from secretarial work to the Bookmobile Library.

04:43.772 --> 04:48.420
And when I graduated from Sam Houston, I worked on the Bookmobile at Bryan Public.

04:49.121 --> 04:55.412
And then in August or end of July, I had an interview with Rupert Woodward at A&M.

04:56.434 --> 04:59.599
He was assistant director then.

05:00.203 --> 05:20.625
I came over and talked to him, and I know students today, people today will not believe, but when I came over to interview, my mother and my dad and my brother and my niece and my nephew were all in the car with me, and we parked outside of what's now the biological sciences building, and they waited while I talked to Mr. Woodward.

05:21.483 --> 05:24.728
And Hazel Richardson was a librarian at Bryan Public.

05:24.808 --> 05:26.711
And she said, take that job.

05:26.751 --> 05:29.856
You'll have more opportunities there than as a public library.

05:30.878 --> 05:32.541
So I came to work with A&M.

05:33.762 --> 05:37.969
And I. As far as you recall, describe the interview.

05:37.989 --> 05:39.211
About how long did it take?

05:39.271 --> 05:40.453
What did he talk about?

05:41.429 --> 05:42.270
I don't remember.

05:42.330 --> 05:48.238
I know he asked me what I wanted to do, and if I thought about going to graduate school, and I said, yes.

05:49.459 --> 05:53.264
And he said, well, what, have you had any foreign language?

05:53.344 --> 05:55.947
And I said, no, they didn't have foreign languages.

05:56.027 --> 06:01.915
We had the basic courses at North Hulch, no extracurricular activities.

06:02.896 --> 06:04.618
And when I was at Sam Houston,

06:05.543 --> 06:12.171
I worked in the library there, and I think that's where I decided to stay in the library field.

06:12.992 --> 06:16.957
And so I didn't have time because I was putting my way through school.

06:17.998 --> 06:21.883
And he said, okay, come here, start taking your foreign language.

06:22.023 --> 06:22.824
What do you want to take?

06:22.884 --> 06:27.930
And I said, oh, I guess Spanish because that was the, everybody took Spanish.

06:27.970 --> 06:30.133
He says, no, take Russian.

06:30.113 --> 06:31.775
I said, okay, why not?

06:32.416 --> 06:36.202
One language was just as good to me as another one, so I started taking Russian.

06:37.263 --> 06:56.231
And as a result, I got a traineeship, what they called a traineeship, an assistantship at Louisiana State in Baton Rouge, where I worked and transliterated all the Russian materials that was brought in to the university.

06:57.132 --> 07:00.036
And I worked in the Acquisitions Department there,

07:00.353 --> 07:06.742
And today, we don't have the windfalls of the budget like they do sometimes, occasionally.

07:07.423 --> 07:13.351
But people would get money, and I would get real excited if I found a book that cost $2.

07:14.252 --> 07:22.463
Because we had a professor over there that went to a book show in Europe at Belgrade, and he brought the whole collection back.

07:22.645 --> 07:26.613
And any time I found a book that cost a dollar, that wasn't expensive.

07:26.633 --> 07:33.807
And when you're spending over $2,000, it takes a lot of books, less than a dollar apiece to spend them out.

07:33.827 --> 07:36.813
Now this, what, chronologically, when is this?

07:37.374 --> 07:41.582
I was at Sam Houston from May of 61.

07:42.102 --> 07:53.735
through May of 64 and started working at A&M on August 1st of 64 in the reference department, and I'm still in the reference department.

07:54.556 --> 08:03.285
And I went to LSU in, I guess it was May, June of 65, 66, really 66.

08:04.587 --> 08:05.848
You were over at LSU how long?

08:06.065 --> 08:08.008
I was there, I graduated in August of 67.

08:08.068 --> 08:10.151
So I was there about 18 months.

08:10.171 --> 08:11.112
So you did a master's?

08:11.373 --> 08:12.514
A master's degree there.

08:12.755 --> 08:13.315
In library science.

08:13.335 --> 08:14.237
In library science.

08:14.257 --> 08:15.018
And got your Russian.

08:15.579 --> 08:17.521
Well, I have a Russian at A&M.

08:17.541 --> 08:18.443
Oh, you got your Russian here.

08:18.463 --> 08:20.305
I got two years of Russian at A&M.

08:20.746 --> 08:23.830
Three, and then when I came back, I took a third year of Russian.

08:24.631 --> 08:27.736
And I also took Czech at A&M, two years of Czech.

08:29.599 --> 08:31.041
Who taught Czech in those days?

08:31.061 --> 08:32.022
Did Bob Skarbonik?

08:32.356 --> 08:38.824
Dr. Skravanek taught it and Dr. John taught the Russian, the twin Skravanek brothers.

08:39.584 --> 08:42.408
They were mirrored image twins.

08:43.609 --> 08:50.337
And Dr. John would be in Prague and he wrote the textbook and he sent it over in a diplomatic pouch for us to do.

08:51.098 --> 08:52.379
Describe them as teachers.

08:53.200 --> 08:55.042
I think they were great.

08:55.303 --> 08:56.704
They enjoyed what they did.

08:56.744 --> 08:58.346
They enjoyed the students.

09:00.108 --> 09:01.570
Dr. John

09:01.837 --> 09:04.200
with the Russian, was a noted Russian person.

09:04.560 --> 09:10.948
And through his influence, there were a lot of students that went to Russia on an exchange program.

09:12.230 --> 09:18.458
And the tests that the students had to take before they could go, he developed here at A&M.

09:19.279 --> 09:25.306
And we in his class, I guess you would say with the guinea pigs, we had to pass that test.

09:25.827 --> 09:30.072
So everyone in his class could have been an exchange student in Russia.

09:30.254 --> 09:33.778
About how many students were taking those courses here then?

09:33.798 --> 09:36.280
Were there many students taking Russian and Czech?

09:37.021 --> 09:37.722
Maybe 25.

09:38.102 --> 09:39.524
In each?

09:39.664 --> 09:41.226
In either class.

09:41.446 --> 09:42.747
Maybe 30.

09:42.788 --> 09:45.230
And offered two or three years?

09:45.731 --> 09:53.579
Well, I know there were three years of Russian and at least that much of Czech because at that time Czech was the third language in Texas, and it probably still is.

09:54.320 --> 09:56.262
It was English, Spanish, and Czech.

09:56.866 --> 10:01.111
And I took the CHECK program after I finished LSU.

10:02.553 --> 10:07.158
And the SPJST?

10:07.419 --> 10:12.385
Yes, the SPJST, that organization had a scholarship for the students.

10:12.405 --> 10:21.996
And so basically it didn't cost me anything to take CHECK because I had a scholarship each semester I took it.

10:22.347 --> 10:24.731
Czech and Russian are very close.

10:24.811 --> 10:29.839
The Russian has the Cyrillic alphabet and Czech doesn't, but the language is very close.

10:30.720 --> 10:50.751
And I remember on one test that I took when I was writing something that had a G in it, I put the Russian G instead of the Anglican G. But Mr. Scrivani knew because Dr. John and he worked together in the Czech and the Russian.

10:51.305 --> 10:55.951
When I was in the Russian class, there was only one other girl in the class.

10:56.732 --> 10:58.274
Her name was Mary Jane Beasley.

10:58.294 --> 11:00.116
Her dad worked in the double E department.

11:01.098 --> 11:04.201
And we would have discussions with all the Aggies, all the guys.

11:04.242 --> 11:05.223
They were all in the Corps.

11:06.605 --> 11:09.248
And one of them, I wish I could remember his name.

11:09.889 --> 11:11.891
He said, Gus Bishaw Barnett.

11:12.632 --> 11:14.815
It's okay if you take a class here on campus.

11:15.183 --> 11:18.887
You're a part of the institution, but that's the only reason you can take it.

11:19.768 --> 11:24.853
And I always wanted to ask him if I was a right-handed desk or a left-handed desk.

11:24.873 --> 11:28.677
But it was okay that I took classes because I was a part of the institution.

11:28.697 --> 11:31.280
Now, you were one of the first females, weren't you?

11:31.340 --> 11:31.660
Right.

11:32.401 --> 11:33.282
One of the very few.

11:33.743 --> 11:42.472
What was it like to walk down the hallway then as a female to, in a classroom building here on campus?

11:42.492 --> 11:43.553
How was a woman treated?

11:44.512 --> 11:51.780
I think back in 64, 65, the early 60s, the late 60s and all, it was better than it is now.

11:52.901 --> 11:54.123
Everyone was polite.

11:54.623 --> 12:05.896
We had more of the howdy and people meant it on campus in the building and young men, all the men on campus were very polite to women.

12:06.437 --> 12:11.262
They opened the doors and nobody thought that was anything

12:12.338 --> 12:13.139
unusual.

12:13.479 --> 12:14.341
You expected it.

12:15.622 --> 12:17.284
And they wanted to help you with things.

12:19.908 --> 12:24.033
They just were more polite and more courteous to you than they are now.

12:24.133 --> 12:26.016
And it wasn't that many students here, though.

12:26.837 --> 12:27.638
True, true.

12:27.658 --> 12:28.039
I think.

12:28.639 --> 12:33.946
Now did you, in those early, when you first came to work here, did you live out at North Zillings?

12:34.607 --> 12:34.868
No.

12:34.888 --> 12:39.814
I wanted to move away from home, so I moved over here on

12:39.929 --> 12:41.471
what's called College Main.

12:42.433 --> 12:44.656
I think the house is gone now.

12:44.676 --> 12:46.299
R.L.

12:46.359 --> 13:01.583
Brown was the minister of the Baptist Church here, and he lived on the corner, and right next to him was the house that belonged to his sister or sister-in-law that had been divided into four apartments, and I happened to have the smallest one, and the Browns

13:02.120 --> 13:05.083
All the ones that lived in that apartment were girls.

13:06.185 --> 13:07.086
And they were going to school.

13:07.106 --> 13:08.307
They were in graduate school.

13:09.128 --> 13:20.260
And like the girl across the hall was from Beaumont and she later married a statistician that's now from Indonesia and they're at the UN now.

13:20.761 --> 13:22.623
And I keep in touch with them.

13:23.264 --> 13:25.166
There was a couple from Israel.

13:25.747 --> 13:28.490
There was a young lady from Argentina.

13:29.451 --> 13:31.553
Do you remember what the rent was on that apartment?

13:31.634 --> 13:34.679
I think I paid $40 a month.

13:35.340 --> 13:35.881
Unfurnished?

13:36.181 --> 13:37.162
No, it was furnished.

13:37.463 --> 13:38.645
It was a furnished apartment.

13:39.566 --> 13:49.001
And every, at least once a semester, Mrs. Brown had her people that lived there over for lunch.

13:49.702 --> 13:59.717
And I remember it was really funny to go home for lunch and Mr. Brown would turn on the sprinklers and you couldn't get out of the apartment without getting wet and you'd turn them off

13:59.967 --> 14:01.991
to go in and he would turn them on again.

14:02.051 --> 14:05.759
And she had a very lovely luncheon for us.

14:06.360 --> 14:10.849
And one day she had strawberries for dessert and forgot to take them out of the freezer.

14:11.070 --> 14:13.615
And have you ever eaten a frozen strawberry?

14:14.477 --> 14:16.120
It was very hard, but we did it.

14:17.213 --> 14:23.702
Now, back to beginning with your A&M experience.

14:23.722 --> 14:30.511
You, as far as you know, were you the only interviewee for that job, or were you one of many?

14:32.133 --> 14:32.854
I really don't know.

14:32.914 --> 14:35.878
There might have been... How did you hear about the vacancy?

14:37.580 --> 14:40.604
Mrs. Richardson at Bryan Public knew about it.

14:41.045 --> 14:41.145
Okay.

14:41.868 --> 14:45.252
And we were called library ones, library assistants.

14:46.113 --> 14:48.275
It was in the classified staff position.

14:49.436 --> 14:54.242
And do you remember anything about the interview?

14:54.282 --> 14:55.483
What it covered?

14:55.503 --> 15:02.051
I know he asked me what I did in school and what my goals were.

15:02.071 --> 15:03.773
It was kind of like a standard interview.

15:03.813 --> 15:04.613
What was my goals?

15:05.154 --> 15:07.757
And was I planning on going to graduate school?

15:07.923 --> 15:12.308
When did you learn that the job was offered to you?

15:13.509 --> 15:14.050
How did you?

15:15.292 --> 15:16.873
I'm thinking within a couple of days.

15:17.014 --> 15:18.155
Did you get a phone call?

15:19.356 --> 15:20.117
I'm trying to remember.

15:20.197 --> 15:25.143
I know I did get a letter, and I think I got a call at the Bryan Public saying, you know, do you want the job?

15:25.884 --> 15:27.105
What was the beginning salary?

15:27.726 --> 15:32.091
I think, and they told me this, and I've kind of always worked on this, which is kind of,

15:32.560 --> 15:33.281
disheartening.

15:33.822 --> 15:40.212
At the time, it was the end of the year, the end of the budget, and they couldn't offer me the salary they normally would have.

15:40.232 --> 15:43.957
So I started with a low salary, and it ended up being around $4,000 a year.

15:45.720 --> 15:53.071
And they always promised that I would get a raise up, but that's like a lot of things that doesn't always come through.

15:53.251 --> 15:53.732
Okay.

15:53.752 --> 15:57.658
Describe, when you began, describe the Texas A&M Library.

15:57.738 --> 15:58.459
Where was it?

15:58.860 --> 16:00.222
What was it physically?

16:00.809 --> 16:05.020
The Cushing, what we know as the Cushing Building was the Cushing Library.

16:06.103 --> 16:11.056
And when I interviewed, it was closed stacks in the end of July.

16:11.618 --> 16:13.182
When I came to work in August,

16:13.482 --> 16:14.943
that just opened the stacks.

16:15.144 --> 16:20.349
Up until then, the only people that could go under the stacks were graduate students that had a letter.

16:20.589 --> 16:23.132
The students paged the books for them.

16:24.213 --> 16:32.862
Circulation was to your right as you came in the door, just in what's now where the reception area is now.

16:33.503 --> 16:37.887
And then the room just to the immediate right was the

16:37.867 --> 16:50.037
current periodicals for science and engineering or science and technology, and the current periodicals for the humanities and social sciences, I think they call it the Mayo Room now.

16:50.337 --> 16:58.908
You had your stairways that went up and I worked in the second floor, which I'm so glad that restored that old reference room.

16:59.589 --> 17:03.194
We had a big reference desk and I had a desk at the end of the reference desk.

17:03.234 --> 17:04.255
There were no offices.

17:04.355 --> 17:10.103
The director and assistant director and the library secretary were the only ones that had offices.

17:10.123 --> 17:11.905
Now who was the director then?

17:12.065 --> 17:13.387
Bob House, Robert House.

17:13.707 --> 17:14.408
Describe him.

17:14.969 --> 17:18.994
I didn't know him very much because he was on leave and then he

17:19.075 --> 17:27.805
moved on to San Antonio to, not St.

17:27.825 --> 17:28.706
Mary's, what is?

17:29.067 --> 17:29.928
Our Lady of the Lake.

17:29.948 --> 17:35.074
Our Lady of the Lake in San Antonio, and I think he stayed there until he finally retired.

17:35.575 --> 17:36.576
Then who replaced him?

17:39.720 --> 17:45.066
See, Rupert Woodward was assistant and acting director, and then

17:48.691 --> 17:54.038
I think Dr. Dyke came because he was the director.

17:54.058 --> 17:58.184
He'd come kind of when I was at LSU because he came to LSU.

17:58.804 --> 17:59.485
That's D-Y-K-E.

17:59.806 --> 18:03.551
D-Y-K-E, and I can't remember what his first name is right now.

18:04.252 --> 18:10.239
He came to LSU to interview, and he asked me if I planned on coming back to A&M.

18:11.481 --> 18:12.943
And when I left,

18:13.480 --> 18:28.002
I left with the agreement that I would take a leave of absence for a year to go to graduate school and I would come back for at least a year for the kind of cold thing.

18:28.022 --> 18:33.590
And I felt like that I had given my word that I would come back at least one year.

18:34.852 --> 18:38.357
And this is really where I wanted to work anyhow.

18:38.928 --> 18:41.771
It was good for me because I'd always wanted to work at A&M.

18:42.972 --> 18:45.295
I had a chance to go to the Library of Congress.

18:45.315 --> 18:51.622
Several of my classmates went, and I would have had a roommate in Washington, which was important.

18:52.583 --> 18:56.086
But I said no, I had given my word to come back here a year.

18:56.327 --> 18:59.890
I could have gone up there the next year, but I didn't.

19:00.071 --> 19:07.939
My parents were elderly and not in good health, and being within 45 minutes of them was a plus for A&M.

19:08.189 --> 19:12.093
Now at that time, how did this library compare with LSU's library?

19:13.059 --> 19:14.166
LSU was much larger.

19:15.192 --> 19:19.158
But I think we've always had a good library for its size.

19:21.000 --> 19:40.407
The old reference room at one end of the reference desk, we had our interlibrary loan set up and I worked doing interlibrary loan there and borrowed books and learned a lot from Lavelle Castle, who was the librarian.

19:41.095 --> 19:43.061
There weren't that many librarians around.

19:43.182 --> 19:47.174
In fact, there was one girl who had gone to LSU that encouraged me to go to LSU.

19:47.716 --> 19:52.692
Who were some of the other key people on the library staff in the first years?

19:53.752 --> 19:55.915
I remember Ms.

19:55.995 --> 19:56.676
McFrancis.

19:57.377 --> 19:59.900
She was a cataloger, the only cataloger.

20:00.060 --> 20:02.263
And what was so unusual about Ms.

20:02.303 --> 20:06.248
McFrancis is she chain-smoked.

20:06.969 --> 20:14.138
She always had a cigarette and a long ash, and she wore a visor because the lights bothered her eyes.

20:15.199 --> 20:19.725
But she was always in cataloging, chain-smoking, doing her cataloging.

20:20.144 --> 20:21.886
And that was up on the third floor?

20:21.906 --> 20:22.867
It was on the third floor.

20:22.907 --> 20:27.972
The third floor had a collection called the Aerospace Aeronautical Engineering Collection.

20:28.592 --> 20:34.138
The cataloging, cereals, all the technical services was there.

20:34.759 --> 20:39.483
The binding was in the basement of the Cushing and also in the basement of the Cushing.

20:39.583 --> 20:48.312
In the back corner it was a fallout shelter and we had all the barrels of water and food and all for a nuclear fallout.

20:48.983 --> 20:52.948
And I'm sure that when they renovated it, they found a lot of that.

20:53.569 --> 20:55.411
Was Mrs. Sigareff still around?

20:55.431 --> 20:57.294
I don't remember Mrs. Sigareff.

20:58.015 --> 21:00.338
See, for me, she was important.

21:00.358 --> 21:11.813
She was the widow of a longtime history faculty member, Sigareff, who was of Bulgarian ancestry, but was kind of lordly.

21:11.833 --> 21:14.957
And in the nickname era, he was Count Sigareff.

21:16.220 --> 21:21.030
And since I was from history, she headed the order department when I first got here.

21:21.832 --> 21:32.654
And she would let three or four of us that would eat our psych lunches together, she'd let us about once a week come over and go through everything that had come in that week in the order department.

21:33.476 --> 21:36.642
But most important, near the end of the fiscal year,

21:37.955 --> 22:00.691
she would tip us off that biology had a few hundred dollars that they weren't gonna spend, or sociology had some, and we history, we would turn in all kinds of requests, and she would put them on somebody else's budget to avoid the money reverting back to the fiscal office.

22:01.191 --> 22:05.498
And so history got a few more books than it normally would have gotten because of Mrs. Segariff.

22:06.018 --> 22:07.660
I don't remember Mrs. Cigar.

22:07.721 --> 22:08.261
She could have been.

22:08.281 --> 22:24.665
Dorothy Kelly and Catherine Valenta, they were what we would call classified staff now, and they had long tenures here at A&M and have retired, but they were in what's now called the Acquisitions Department, ordering and buying materials.

22:25.226 --> 22:28.431
Now, did you hear any stories about Tommy Mayo?

22:29.660 --> 22:33.650
No, I seem like I was... Because he was kind of legendary.

22:34.312 --> 22:34.432
Right.

22:34.452 --> 22:43.315
I presume that... Let's see, who would have been... Were there any long-time library staff members then?

22:43.733 --> 22:47.499
Just, well, like I said, Catherine Valenta, Dorothy Kelly.

22:47.539 --> 22:49.482
Dorothy Kelly and I came about the same time.

22:49.883 --> 22:53.649
Doris Ramsey and her mother were long-time.

22:53.689 --> 22:58.536
And Doris' mother was in the bindery department.

22:59.418 --> 23:02.743
And Mrs. Vaughn, Beatrice Vaughn, had been in circulation.

23:04.125 --> 23:11.817
And as a newcomer, did you get any kind of guidance, direction, guidelines, orders?

23:15.610 --> 23:19.536
Mrs. Castle had this for all the new people that worked in reference.

23:20.057 --> 23:23.782
They had bookcases, and if you go into the cushion now, you'll see those bookcases.

23:24.563 --> 23:30.072
And they were case, and we had them numbered one through 30 or whatever it was.

23:30.613 --> 23:34.218
Right behind the desk were the first ones, and they had the handbooks back there.

23:34.238 --> 23:35.580
And you worked around the room.

23:36.501 --> 23:42.951
And to the, as you're going out of the reading room in Cushing now to the, uh,

23:43.302 --> 23:45.805
left were the history books.

23:45.826 --> 23:48.149
And you learned what was in each case.

23:48.870 --> 23:53.817
And you drew a diagram of the room and what was on each shelf, what type of books it were.

23:54.578 --> 24:02.589
The law books like Southwestern Reporter and Microfilm were at the, what direction is that?

24:03.270 --> 24:07.656
As you're facing the exit door, it's to your right.

24:08.716 --> 24:15.326
South end of the room was the law stuff and some of the business materials.

24:15.987 --> 24:18.370
But you had to know what was in each case.

24:18.410 --> 24:20.012
And she would say, what is in case 14?

24:21.074 --> 24:21.795
What is in case?

24:22.736 --> 24:24.138
And so you were quizzed on it.

24:25.300 --> 24:28.264
And you had to look at them and know what they were.

24:28.445 --> 24:34.233
And I remember when I was in graduate school, I came home over Christmas and came over to do some work.

24:34.794 --> 24:37.778
And the students knew that I worked at the library.

24:38.264 --> 24:49.621
And so while I was studying, since it was Christmas, and there were a few students around, they would ask me questions because they knew I knew where to find things in that room.

24:50.883 --> 24:56.492
What were, in that era, what were the typical questions that Aggie students asked for library help?

24:58.784 --> 25:04.132
Probably the same type questions we have now on how to find materials.

25:04.733 --> 25:11.203
But we had a file, a vertical file, of what we call the cush questions.

25:13.086 --> 25:20.818
And cush questions, any upperclassmen could ask a freshman at their meal a question.

25:20.838 --> 25:22.080
They had to come up with the answer.

25:22.120 --> 25:26.867
They didn't get cush or their dessert until they came up with the answer.

25:26.932 --> 25:31.122
Did you library folks have a favorite Kush question that y'all snickered about most?

25:31.984 --> 25:40.705
Well, they always want to know where the, one of the Kush questions is where the deep hole, black hole of Calcutta was.

25:41.478 --> 25:43.560
And that was in the Animal Industries building.

25:43.620 --> 25:48.987
When they slaughtered the animals, the blood went down to some kind of drain there.

25:49.027 --> 25:50.608
That was a black hole in Calcutta.

25:51.389 --> 25:54.653
They always wanted to know where the fossil was on campus.

25:54.973 --> 25:57.777
And they didn't mean the museum that was on campus.

25:58.197 --> 26:03.503
And it was actually some type of fossil embedded in the steps as you walk into the Cushing area.

26:03.483 --> 26:10.029
And I've noticed that since they renovated, they've concrete over it.

26:10.109 --> 26:13.152
But it was nice to find nowhere that was.

26:13.632 --> 26:18.337
What were the, in that era, what were the normal hours of Cushing Library?

26:19.077 --> 26:22.100
We closed at 10 o'clock at night.

26:22.120 --> 26:22.941
8 to 10.

26:23.201 --> 26:24.522
And what about weekends?

26:24.883 --> 26:28.666
Weekends, I remember they were open on Saturdays.

26:28.746 --> 26:31.068
And I remember when we started opening on Sundays.

26:31.589 --> 26:32.950
But we didn't open until 1.

26:33.757 --> 26:43.192
And it was kinda, we did it because other libraries in the area, other major libraries were being opened on Sundays.

26:43.433 --> 26:53.930
But you didn't have that much truth because mostly Sunday was Southern tradition, I guess, I don't know how it is in other parts of the country, but Sunday was a day of rest.

26:54.951 --> 26:59.038
And you didn't open until after people had a chance to go to church.

26:59.390 --> 27:08.617
Now, I've heard that the library was kind of off limits for hazing and so forth, that a core freshman could come over to the library and kind of get away from everything.

27:09.159 --> 27:10.723
Was that, did that seem to be true?

27:10.764 --> 27:13.973
That seemed to be true, and if the students

27:14.543 --> 27:19.790
wanted to get out of their uniform, they could sign out to go to the library.

27:20.551 --> 27:25.779
And I'm not sure, but I think they probably checked, had somebody checking to see that they were in the library.

27:26.279 --> 27:30.505
But they had to be back in their dorms about 10 o'clock at night, and that's why we closed at 10.

27:31.186 --> 27:36.754
Also, they had the silver tap ceremony much more often than we do now.

27:36.734 --> 27:39.818
And everything was blacked out.

27:40.038 --> 27:41.200
All lights went out.

27:41.220 --> 27:42.181
Including the library.

27:42.201 --> 27:43.323
Including the library.

27:43.723 --> 27:45.346
Everything was dark on campus.

27:46.207 --> 27:50.633
And Silver Taps were at 10 and they had the taps.

27:50.653 --> 27:58.303
I think the guys were in the tower of the academic building that actually blew the taps and fired the

27:59.009 --> 28:00.677
the 21-gun salute.

28:00.697 --> 28:05.400
And you and everybody else in the reference room took your turns working nights and weekends?

28:05.421 --> 28:07.973
We all took our turns working nights and weekends.

28:08.628 --> 28:12.212
And it wasn't but about two of us that worked at a time.

28:14.214 --> 28:19.299
We had a clipping file for the battalion at the reference desk that people would come in.

28:19.339 --> 28:33.034
Now they have it on, and we had it on microfilm too, but we would, I remember sitting at that desk on Sundays because you were sitting on a high stool or a high chair, which now you have the counter height, the desktop height.

28:33.054 --> 28:37.318
How often did you ever have to

28:38.902 --> 28:45.150
How often did you have to restrain a student or tell them to quit doing something or not make so much noise?

28:45.230 --> 28:45.591
Was that?

28:46.512 --> 28:54.202
Occasionally, students would get to studying back in the corner and get a little noisy, and so we would go over and ask them to tone it down to a dull roar.

28:54.462 --> 28:55.483
But in general, they were?

28:55.503 --> 29:02.792
In general, they weren't, and it's just as if there was a table full of about six or eight students, that can get a little noisy.

29:03.133 --> 29:06.377
Did you ever see any of them go to sleep?

29:06.661 --> 29:08.886
Oh, students were always sleeping in the library.

29:09.367 --> 29:12.434
They'd be studying, and all of a sudden their heads would go down on their books.

29:13.456 --> 29:16.803
And they'd take quick naps and then wake up and do it again.

29:16.823 --> 29:19.990
No, and they never smoked in the library.

29:20.010 --> 29:21.253
The students never did, did they?

29:21.654 --> 29:24.079
I didn't see very much smoking on campus at all.

29:25.004 --> 29:28.956
so that they behaved and they took care of things.

29:29.478 --> 29:32.065
The library in those days was all Dewey Decimal.

29:32.447 --> 29:32.988
All Dewey.

29:33.149 --> 29:36.278
In 1968, we started converting to Library of Congress.

29:36.439 --> 29:37.562
Oh, describe that.

29:38.048 --> 29:54.625
Well, the new books that came into the collection in about 68 were in the old engineering library, which is part of this library, and they were cataloged in the Library of Congress, and they would try to start bringing some of the Dewey materials and reclassing them.

29:54.645 --> 30:00.370
If they got a new edition of a book or a second copy, they would do it.

30:00.431 --> 30:06.857
And there was a lot of, I don't know how to do that, but I still think a lot of people

30:07.563 --> 30:10.848
They're not so much now because they've gotten used to the Library of Congress.

30:11.289 --> 30:22.646
But it was expressed to them that if they had a Library of Congress number, they could go to any major library in the United States and find the same book with almost identical call number.

30:23.007 --> 30:29.737
What we call the cutter number for the author might be a little bit different, but the basic subject would be the same all over the United States.

30:30.498 --> 30:32.982
And so that was a plus for the students.

30:33.322 --> 30:36.287
Now the Engineering Library, the Gilchrist Library,

30:36.807 --> 30:39.914
Did it operate entirely as a separate unit?

30:40.234 --> 30:40.876
Yes, it did.

30:41.056 --> 30:43.361
It's staffing and... It's staffing and everything.

30:43.381 --> 30:54.504
Did they have their own order department and cataloging and... That might have been through the main library, but their staffing and their hours were entirely different.

30:55.366 --> 30:57.330
And then as they built...

30:58.593 --> 31:07.141
the fourth floor addition of this building, of this Evans building, they started bringing in all the satellite libraries.
