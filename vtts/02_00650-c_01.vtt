00:04.942 --> 00:22.346
My

00:04.942 --> 00:22.346
first contact with Walter Monk was before, was in 
1937, when

00:04.942 --> 00:22.346
he was an undergraduate at Caltech. You got to see 
him going? Sure had. He came down here in the

00:27.012 --> 00:32.299
summertime, that summer. I think he basically 
came down here because he was interested in the

00:33.612 --> 00:48.327
girl named Shlump Sanders,

00:33.612 --> 00:48.327
the granddaughter of Ellen Browning Scripps' 
lawyer, Jacob Harper. Anyhow, he was here, and he

00:48.347 --> 00:50.069
worked at Scripps. And we spent several days 
together sitting in a rowboat about half a mile off

00:51.270 --> 01:01.020
the end of our pier measuring currents. We had a 
contraption that you could lower to the bottom.

01:10.166 --> 01:13.211
It would sit on the bottom and measure currents 
there. And we could also measure them in the water

01:13.231 --> 01:16.575
coming up to the surface. And we did this by hand 
over and over and over again for several days.

01:24.686 --> 01:27.470
And he came back. He's been coming back ever since.

01:33.046 --> 01:38.132
He was one of our first summer fellows at Scripps. 
He turned out so successfully that they've been

01:38.152 --> 01:45.021
running this summer fellowship program for the 
last 40 years. I don't think they've ever found

01:46.643 --> 01:48.986
anybody quite his equal. In fact, I don't know of 
anybody who ever became an oceanographer that

01:49.006 --> 01:53.652
way, besides Walter. But maybe once in 40 years is 
enough.

02:00.130 --> 02:03.535
Well, exactly how did Operation Crossroads 
evolve?

02:14.069 --> 02:27.488
The first I heard of it was when two naval captains, 
I was a commander in the Bureau of Ships then,

02:14.069 --> 02:27.488
two naval captains, one of whom was Horatio 
Rivera, You may have heard of him. He was later

02:31.085 --> 02:43.239
deputy chief of naval operations, commander of 
NATO forces in southern Europe, later ambassador

02:31.085 --> 02:43.239
to Spain.

02:46.583 --> 02:56.175
He was a little man from Puerto Rico, about five 
feet, two inches high, and one of the brightest men

02:46.583 --> 02:56.175
I ever saw in my life.

02:57.539 --> 03:15.501
A captain named Ashworth, Fred Ashworth, who was 
an aviator, called me into their office

02:57.539 --> 03:15.501
and asked me to help pick out a site for an atomic 
bomb test, a test of atomic bombs against naval

02:57.539 --> 03:15.501
ships.

03:18.565 --> 03:25.774
So Mary Sears and I got together, and

03:18.565 --> 03:25.774
they were thinking about Bikini already. in the 
Marshall Islands in general,

03:27.307 --> 03:36.317
we recommended a bikini. But they'd already been 
thinking of making a test. You may not remember it

03:40.882 --> 03:56.959
if you're too young, but in those days, there was a 
great deal of question about whether, with the

03:40.882 --> 03:56.959
existence of atomic bombs, naval ships were of any 
use anymore. So the problem of just how vulnerable

03:58.627 --> 04:10.340
ships were to them was an important subject. And 
we, of course, had lots of ships. We had the

04:13.244 --> 04:17.088
greatest Navy that the world had ever dreamed of, 
let alone seen. Many more ships than we had

04:18.810 --> 04:22.074
possibly ever used again. And so they They 
appointed Admiral W.H.P. Blandy as commander of

04:32.051 --> 04:38.839
his task force, and Deke Parson as the technical 
officer in charge.

04:46.568 --> 04:50.193
Both these officers were members of what the Navy 
has called a gun club. They were ordnance

04:50.213 --> 04:52.736
officers. Although Blandy had actually had 
command Task Force

04:58.094 --> 05:05.823
in the city. They were both service officers,

05:06.144 --> 05:13.232
service ship officers. But I guess Parsons was 
actually a specialist, but not in line of command.

05:20.121 --> 05:23.545
He was a specialist in ordnance. He had been 
involved right from the beginning at Los Alamos

05:25.786 --> 05:31.475
and elsewhere in the development of the Manhattan 
Project. And he was the bombardier on one of the two

05:32.517 --> 05:38.868
atomic bomb drops in Japan.

05:42.374 --> 05:48.604
And they assembled a staff, a

05:42.374 --> 05:48.604
big staff. worked very closely with Los Alamos, 
who were making the bomb. They were really

05:53.682 --> 05:56.705
devices. One of them was a device, and the other was 
an actual

05:56.725 --> 06:04.653
weapon. And one of the things that we thought had to 
be known was what would be the effect of the

06:04.673 --> 06:17.325
explosion and the radioactivity on the atoll. So 
we decided that we'd make an ecological,

06:18.976 --> 06:44.376
essentially an ecological base study to find out 
what the conditions were before they, find out as

06:18.976 --> 06:44.376
much as we could about what was there and what 
things were like before any radioactive had been

06:18.976 --> 06:44.376
released and before there was any explosion. And 
so we sent out an old ship, the Bowditch,

06:51.173 --> 07:01.409
to do with a whole group of scientists, various 
kinds of scientists, geologists, botanists,

06:51.173 --> 07:01.409
fish people, people to study all the different 
kinds of living things that were there. One of the

07:02.691 --> 07:06.397
people was Harry Ladd from the Geological Survey. 
Another was a man named Taylor from the University

07:08.039 --> 07:11.965
of Michigan. William Randolph Taylor was a great 
taxonomic botanist. Jack Marr was there for the

07:16.452 --> 07:20.117
fishing, for the fish part of it. Quite a few fish 
people. We had experimental fishermen as well as

07:21.979 --> 07:26.565
fish taxonomists. And they spent about six months 
making a profile of what Bikini Atoll would like.

07:33.954 --> 07:37.638
And the surrounding waters where Ken Emery was 
there did a lot of work on the bottom. I

07:39.401 --> 07:45.328
guess Bill Bonarcs was there.

07:48.262 --> 07:52.187
There were three people from Woods Hole looking at 
the water and looking at the diffusion of the

07:48.262 --> 07:52.187
water. It was a

07:54.290 --> 08:01.941
group of people from a lot of different 
institutions. One of the people was Marsden

08:01.961 --> 08:08.530
Sargent from SREPS, who was my assistant in the 
Bureau of Ships. And he was made the project

08:08.630 --> 08:11.434
officer.

08:17.270 --> 08:31.522
And they had this old hydrographic survey ship 
that was sent out there and spent about six months

08:17.270 --> 08:31.522
there, long in advance of the arrival of the task 
force, finding out what the biology was like. Then

08:32.784 --> 08:39.189
we had other oceanographic things that we, 
responsibilities that we had were, one, to

08:32.784 --> 08:39.189
measure the waves. That was perhaps the most 
important

08:39.209 --> 08:43.413
thing. We thought there might be some very big 
waves, particularly from the underwater test.

08:48.607 --> 09:01.486
And we also had a group of destroyers to measure the 
radioactivity in the water outside the atoll to

08:48.607 --> 09:01.486
try to follow the fallout. I'm not sure they were 
destroyed. I think they were EPCER. They were

09:06.314 --> 09:08.998
smaller than the destroyer, about six of them. 
John Lyman was in charge of that part of it.

09:25.411 --> 09:45.651
And then we had I

09:25.411 --> 09:45.651
guess everything was really related to the waves, 
one way or the other. But we did a lot of different

09:45.671 --> 09:46.952
things. We put up photographic towers 100 feet 
high. put the cameras on them, it would be started

09:53.137 --> 09:55.981
automatically. And still cameras, essentially, 
would take very good pictures of what happened,

09:56.022 --> 10:03.073
the sequence of events. We had bottom-mounted 
wave meters, which we called turtles. They were

10:07.680 --> 10:09.663
developed by Alan Vines and his whole. Jeff Holder 
had a very simple system. He put up sticks on the

10:14.671 --> 10:19.178
beach, poles on the beach, with a series of tin cans 
nailed at different heights above the beach. And

10:24.887 --> 10:30.092
those cans that were filled with water would show 
how high the wave was at that point, you see.

10:31.553 --> 10:46.887
Another

10:31.553 --> 10:46.887
man who was not part of our group, but who was the 
same ingenious kind of a person was Bill Penney,

10:31.553 --> 10:46.887
who later became Lord Penney, in charge of the 
British atomic weapons establishment.

10:49.415 --> 10:52.439
He had tin cans that were closed. You could measure 
the blast by seeing how much these were bent or

10:53.741 --> 11:01.873
dented, how much they were squeezed together.

11:04.957 --> 11:16.013
Almost as ingenious as Jeff's idea of these open 
tin cans that would show the wave

11:04.957 --> 11:16.013
height. a whole ship that was devoted to these 
oceanographic measurements. John Isaacs was

11:22.606 --> 11:27.291
very much involved with the photography. Gifford 
Ewing and Walter Monk were involved with the

11:27.311 --> 11:40.283
measurements of the dispersion or diffusion of 
the radioactivity inside the atoll. We had a lot of

11:41.183 --> 11:46.168
measurements, ways of measuring radioactivity 
inside the atoll. I think Ted Folsom was involved

11:47.279 --> 11:51.005
with this, too. I'm not quite sure whether he was or 
not, but I think so.

11:56.152 --> 11:57.855
John Isaacs can tell you a lot about that. He had all 
sorts of funny experiences. We were putting up

12:02.101 --> 12:15.902
these wave measuring devices and dispersion

12:02.101 --> 12:15.902
measuring devices. all over the atoll. It was 
about 20 miles long, the lagoon, I mean, inside the

12:17.957 --> 12:23.804
atoll. And they had a series of landing craft

12:23.824 --> 12:32.455
to carry them around and to move from one end of the 
atoll to the other. These were not LC VMs. They were

12:35.078 --> 12:39.884
one size larger. They were essentially about 50 
foot long, 60 foot long, and quite beamy, sort of

12:39.904 --> 12:46.412
barges. And it was typical. Those were the days 
when the Navy was its absolute navy. And most of the

12:54.390 --> 13:08.123
enlisted men there were guys who had been paroled 
or

12:54.390 --> 13:08.123
sentenced to jail or the Navy's equivalent of jail 
for quite a long time. But if they'd go out to

13:08.143 --> 13:16.030
Bikini, they'd be paroled, put on probation. And 
it was typical. crews of these damn landing craft

13:18.185 --> 13:24.773
would get up to the far end of the lagoon and say, 
well, we think our discharge papers have arrived.

13:24.793 --> 13:25.514
We better go back.

13:29.679 --> 13:34.045
And the only guys that were there with them were the 
civilians, the scientists. They didn't pay any

13:34.065 --> 13:36.127
attention to them. They had to pay very little 
attention to them. They had to go back and by God,

13:38.250 --> 13:42.636
their discharge papers had arrived. And you had to 
get another crew and start all over again. We had

13:48.475 --> 13:54.985
also quite a bit of experimental work in advance of 
it, particularly the underwater test. Because

13:55.005 --> 14:13.853
the underwater test was, there had been a theory 
developed in the last part of the war, which was

13:55.005 --> 14:13.853
given a good deal of credence by Winston 
Churchill, that he thought it was true that you

13:55.005 --> 14:13.853
could make a huge wave if you made an explosion at 
the right, big enough explosion at the right depth

13:55.005 --> 14:13.853
underwater. The theory more or less wore this out. 
that this wave would travel a very long way and

14:19.542 --> 14:32.198
would be a kind of a weapon, causing

14:19.542 --> 14:32.198
very considerable amounts of damage at great 
distances. This underwater explosion was one way

14:32.258 --> 14:39.167
of testing this out. And in order to get some idea of 
the magnitude and of the phenomenology, Mike

14:39.187 --> 14:48.098
O'Brien, who was then dean School of Engineering 
at Berkeley, College of Engineering at Berkeley,

14:50.187 --> 15:00.664
organized a series of tests, test explosions, 
which they photographed with high-speed

14:50.187 --> 15:00.664
photography.

15:05.292 --> 15:12.904
And

15:05.292 --> 15:12.904
we, afterwards, we looked back on those tests and 
we saw something which really occurred as a

15:14.757 --> 15:16.419
painting. That was something called the Bay 
Surge. Have you ever heard of the Bay Surge? The Bay

15:20.845 --> 15:24.269
Surge is the most frightening thing I ever saw in my 
life. First time to see it. It was what looked like a

15:28.394 --> 15:37.225
wall of solid water, several hundred feet high, 
moving very rapidly out from the point of the

15:28.394 --> 15:37.225
explosion.

15:40.249 --> 15:44.494
But after it got about half a mile out, it stopped.

15:45.453 --> 15:46.895
and lifted from the surface. And then there was a 
huge rain. And what it was was essentially a very

15:50.899 --> 15:54.283
dense cloud. It was a density current. What 
happened was that the underwater explosion shot a

15:58.168 --> 16:11.143
column of water and air, a huge pillar, about half a 
mile across, up into the air. And then this thing

16:11.904 --> 16:14.127
settled down again. And it was essentially a mist

16:15.203 --> 16:23.333
or a cloud. But it was heavier than air because 
there was so much water in it. So it came down like

16:28.859 --> 16:31.422
this and then spread out like this. Then as enough 
water dropped out of the thing, it was hot.

16:36.869 --> 16:44.738
Therefore, the air was able to lift above the 
surface of the base surge after about something

16:36.869 --> 16:44.738
like 30 seconds. just lifted off the water. It 
turned out not to be a wave at all. And there were

16:49.287 --> 16:53.251
waves in addition, and we were able to measure the 
waves. The waves were like 10 feet high or 15 feet

16:53.271 --> 16:57.055
high. This thing was, to begin with, a couple 
hundred feet high. This looked terrible. It moved

17:03.582 --> 17:04.983
very, very rapidly. It was what we call a density 
curve, coming out like that. This was a very

17:10.929 --> 17:14.353
interesting phenomenon, which we never would 
have really been able understand or even to record

17:15.515 --> 17:38.005
if it hadn't been for the

17:15.515 --> 17:38.005
enormous amount of work that John Isaacs and other 
guys did in setting up these photographic towers

17:15.515 --> 17:38.005
and the photographic

17:15.515 --> 17:38.005
systems. A year later, I organized something 
called a re-survey of Bikini. This was after I was

17:42.711 --> 17:44.273
in ONR. The re-survey went back there with a much 
smaller task force to see what had happened, what

17:45.603 --> 17:53.313
was it like a year later. We had a group of 
biologists and radiochemists there. That was one

18:01.785 --> 18:08.914
of the hardest jobs I ever did in my life, was 
organizing the scientific part of that

18:01.785 --> 18:08.914
re-survey. Nobody wanted to be involved.

18:16.180 --> 18:17.661
But there were lots of radiochemists. And I 
managed to get Charlie Coriel, who later became a

18:17.681 --> 18:24.868
professor of chemistry at MIT. I somehow got, I 
guess I knew him before the war. I knew him at UCLA.

18:30.974 --> 18:36.479
And he'd been involved with the radiochemistry 
business all during the war. And he managed to

18:37.620 --> 18:44.567
recruit a group of good radiochemists to go out 
there to work on this problem.

18:47.382 --> 18:48.844
If it hadn't been for him, I would have been sunk. I 
used to stay up 2 or 3 o'clock in the morning calling

18:48.864 --> 18:56.295
people all over the country, trying to get them to 
go out on this resurvey at Bikini. This was in 1947.

19:02.844 --> 19:04.106
And it worked out very well. The most important 
outcome, however, scientifically, was the

19:04.126 --> 19:13.259
drilling that we did on Bikini Atoll. We got an oil 
well drilling company contract to drill a hole in

19:19.478 --> 19:23.824
the reef. Because the results we got in the 
previous year from our seismic work indicated

19:23.844 --> 19:33.056
that the limestone was several thousand feet 
thick. The reef was several thousand feet thick.

19:36.781 --> 19:43.410
And that maybe at a depth of a mile or more, you 
finally came to basalt.

19:46.512 --> 19:53.340
This is one of the great, at that time, one of the 
great unsolved questions was, what was the origin

19:46.512 --> 19:53.340
of coral reefs? Darwin had had the idea long ago, 
150 years ago, 250 years ago now, that coral reefs

19:54.642 --> 20:04.673
were sunken volcanoes. And then as the volcano 
sank, the coral reef built up. And at first, you had

20:09.900 --> 20:13.684
a volcano here with a fringing reef around it. As 
the volcano sank, the reef moved out and became a

20:14.609 --> 20:18.053
barrier reef. And as the volcano sank still more, 
you had nothing except the reef and the lagoon in

20:18.073 --> 20:25.883
the middle. And there

20:27.746 --> 20:36.798
were other people who said this was just nonsense. 
The reefs were formed during the Pleistocene. And

20:41.604 --> 20:42.625
so it was very important. very important, thought 
to be a very important thing to do to find out just

20:44.005 --> 20:50.352
what they were like. And it turns out, it turns out 
that they were at least Bikini, and later

20:51.433 --> 21:12.696
Eniwetok, and

20:51.433 --> 21:12.696
other ones that have been studied since, that 
they're all flat-topped seamounts where the The

21:13.047 --> 21:23.280
mountain was planed off at sea level with a pile of 
volcanic ash, in other words, lava, cut off by

21:13.047 --> 21:23.280
waves at sea level. And the coral grew around the 
edges of these things. And then they sank. And as

21:30.810 --> 21:39.021
they sank, the coral, if they sank slowly enough, 
the coral could keep up and eventually ended up

21:30.810 --> 21:39.021
with an atoll. The lagoon in an atoll, however it is 
a Pleistocene phenomenon, when the sea level was

21:39.946 --> 21:50.781
about 200 feet lower than it is now, these things 
were all planed off. And so the islands around the

21:50.801 --> 22:09.447
edges of the atoll, I mean the atoll itself, the 
islands around the lagoon, are all not more than a

21:50.801 --> 22:09.447
million years old, formed during the Pleistocene 
on a platform planed off during the Pleistocene,

21:50.801 --> 22:09.447
which is the bottom of the lagoon, the deepest part 
of the lagoon. But underneath that, there's a bone

22:10.439 --> 22:28.456
pile 6,000 feet thick, or 4,000 to 6,000 feet 
thick, of the remains of coral and coralline

22:10.439 --> 22:28.456
algae, which grew on a submerged volcanic 
platform. And you find lots of things called geos,

22:28.476 --> 22:39.366
or flat top seamounts, which sank too fast and 
which have a little bit of coral on them. but not

22:40.325 --> 22:41.126
very much. And they're covered mostly with 
manganese, crusts of manganese, with occasional

22:42.407 --> 22:56.299
shallow water fossils, enough so you can tell 
their age and that they were in shallow water when

22:42.407 --> 22:56.299
they were planed off. And that was one of the 
discoveries we made during our mid-Pacific

22:58.081 --> 23:01.464
expedition. These sea mounts, far from being a 
billion or two billion years old, were about 100

23:02.585 --> 23:10.112
million years old. of Cretaceous age. And we found 
that by finding fossils that were shallow water

23:13.066 --> 23:22.735
fossils, now at depths of 6,000 feet, which were 
Cretaceous fossils. But the first

23:22.775 --> 23:31.704
part of this study was the seismic work during 
Operation Crossroads. But in the follow-up? In

23:33.125 --> 23:35.728
the follow-up, in the bikini resurvey. Should we 
have another Bikini test, by the way, now that the

23:36.586 --> 23:40.370
bombs are more powerful? Well, we have had a whole 
series of the hydrogen bomb tests on Bikini and on

23:41.432 --> 23:52.084
the Weetalk. They tested all the big 
thermonuclear weapons

23:52.104 --> 23:57.831
there. But you're thinking about a test against 
ships? Yes. Well, that's very hard to do.

24:07.349 --> 24:13.937
We did have a test of an underwater atomic weapon 
down here off Mexico. We lowered the weapon to

24:14.858 --> 24:17.982
about 3,000 feet and exploded it.

24:21.226 --> 24:27.454
But nobody's ever, as far as I know, nobody's ever 
exploded a thermonuclear device underwater.

24:31.018 --> 24:32.219
I may be wrong about that. In any case, they're so 
big that if you explode one lagoon like Bikini

24:36.998 --> 24:38.699
Lagoon. You'd blow the water out

24:38.800 --> 24:46.827
of the lagoon. I only have one other question about 
this part of your career I want to ask you. Why not a

24:49.729 --> 24:50.990
career in the Navy? Did you ever consider a career 
in the Navy? Yes, I did.

24:56.935 --> 25:05.723
But

24:56.935 --> 25:05.723
after World War II, not before World War II.

25:23.337 --> 25:30.687
But I

25:23.337 --> 25:30.687
really wanted to go back to Scripps. The only 
reason for considering a career in the Navy was

25:31.949 --> 25:42.204
that

25:31.949 --> 25:42.204
they didn't really want me back at Scripps very 
much. And a lot

25:42.224 --> 25:50.796
of guys

25:42.224 --> 25:50.796
didn't. fairly complex story, but Carl Eckhardt 
and Harold Sverdrup were just bound and

25:51.451 --> 26:06.488
determined that I could be Sverdrup's successor 
as director of

25:51.451 --> 26:06.488
the Scripps Institution.

26:06.508 --> 26:19.322
And there were a lot of, there were several other 
people on the faculty who didn't think this was a

26:06.508 --> 26:19.322
good idea at all, including Fran Shepherd and Carl 
Hubbs of Fisheries. They had different reasons.

26:22.231 --> 26:25.655
My analysis would be that Hubbs thought we ought to 
have a biologist. Not a military man, not a naval

26:27.737 --> 26:30.380
man. All things not a naval

26:30.400 --> 26:35.145
man. Shepard's opposition was basically because 
we hadn't gotten along very well when he had this

26:35.165 --> 26:43.154
project, GSA project. He's

26:43.214 --> 26:50.061
really not very bright.

26:50.935 --> 26:58.685
If Lyman Spitzer has an IQ 40 points higher than 
mine, my IQ is considerably higher than Francis

26:50.935 --> 26:58.685
Shepherd's.

27:00.828 --> 27:06.775
Shepherd's got other qualities, including 
indefatigable curiosity and enormous energy.

27:06.795 --> 27:08.337
But how'd it all be smart? And that's kind of hard to 
work with a much younger man who's a lot smarter

27:10.340 --> 27:14.545
than you are. You don't have a generous spirit.

27:19.712 --> 27:20.773
So in any case, They were opposed to my being 
director. And finally a compromise was hit on that

27:26.492 --> 27:32.320
was that Carl Eckhart should become director. So 
he was director for two years. Was that? 48 to 50. 48

27:38.248 --> 27:38.769
to 50. OK, that makes sense. And he asked me to come 
back as an associate director, which I did. And I

27:46.980 --> 27:50.625
was promoted to the professorship at the same 
time. I'm the only guy who ever went from being an

27:51.365 --> 27:56.471
instructor to being a professor without any 
intermediate steps. I was an instructor when I

27:58.373 --> 28:03.118
went into the Navy and came back here as a 
professor.

28:03.959 --> 28:05.180
And as associate director. My impression is you 
were carried on the faculty listing of Scripps

28:06.962 --> 28:13.850
Institution the whole time you were the Navy. 
That's right. Sure. They may have even promoted me

28:16.092 --> 28:17.914
in absentia. I'm not quite sure about that.
