WEBVTT

00:02.782 --> 00:09.053
November the 23rd, we're testing the tape, 
getting ready to chat with Mike House. We're at his

00:09.073 --> 00:13.340
BMW dealership in Albuquerque. Mike, add a 
sentence there. Albuquerque, New Mexico, matter

00:16.265 --> 00:22.696
of fact.

00:22.716 --> 00:27.304
Mike, as we begin, would you give a brief 
biographical summary where you grew up and what

00:27.908 --> 00:33.397
your parents and so forth before getting to A&M. 
Where was home? I was born in 1951, July 1951. At the

00:39.466 --> 00:46.638
time, my dad worked for American Airlines, and 
about every two years he would travel. And dad and

00:47.639 --> 00:52.988
mom, as a matter of fact, I was to be... born in 
Buffalo New York where dad was and dad wanted to

00:53.643 --> 01:22.350
make sure mom wanted to make sure I was a Texan so she 
flew home right about delivery time and lived with

00:53.643 --> 01:22.350
her mom and dad for about three weeks to make sure I 
was born in Texas and I was born in Ennis Texas which

00:53.643 --> 01:22.350
is where they are retired today and flew back to 
Buffalo and moved around a bit but ended up and grew

00:53.643 --> 01:22.350
up the majority of my life in Dallas and when I was a 
freshman in high school between freshman and

00:53.643 --> 01:22.350
sophomore moved to San Antonio Graduated in San 
Antonio from Churchill High School. And thought I

01:26.535 --> 01:28.437
wanted to go into oceanography. And Texas A&M had a 
program that was top notch. I thought I might be

01:33.464 --> 01:36.068
interested in also flying. So the Air Force 
interested me and the ROTC program interested me.

01:40.814 --> 01:48.284
And as a story in itself, I got in by the skin of my 
teeth by going through the junction program. And

01:48.985 --> 01:52.590
that created some bonding that's gone on to this 
day. Got into A&M in 69 and in four years was able to

01:53.110 --> 01:59.258
graduate with a business administration degree 
with a management major. All right, so my next

01:59.278 --> 02:03.043
question is going to be, why did you attend A&M? You 
attended A&M partly because of what you thought

02:03.643 --> 02:09.150
your major was going to be. That is correct. Had you 
been to visit before you came to enroll? No, I had

02:15.278 --> 02:21.666
never been to the campus prior to three or four days 
before the freshman's In those days, different

02:22.338 --> 02:27.024
than my kids now, I don't remember the choices. And 
not that Dad wouldn't have given them to me if I

02:27.344 --> 02:30.909
would have asked for them. This was my interest, 
and he did everything he could to help me go that

02:30.929 --> 02:34.433
direction. But I didn't have a Newsweek book with 
180 universities to choose from. That just seemed

02:39.139 --> 02:41.642
like a logical choice. So you went to Junction that 
first summer. Correct. Did you come to College

02:45.467 --> 02:48.391
Station and then go to Junction? No, I went to 
Junction first. I went to Junction and committed

02:52.021 --> 03:01.151
six weeks and about seven hours in college courses 
to see if I would be qualified academically. And I

03:01.612 --> 03:04.635
guess I was just hoping I liked that email at this 
point. Did your mom drive you, mom and dad drive you

03:04.655 --> 03:07.439
out to Junction? I remember mom and dad, I had a 
little MG midget, and I remember my mom and dad

03:08.099 --> 03:17.650
followed me in that MG midget out to Junction and 
dropped me off. I have not yet interviewed anyone

03:17.670 --> 03:20.053
about Junction. So please describe that as fully 
as you can. Oh, that's a great, it was a great

03:23.952 --> 03:26.456
program. There were probably, if I were to pick a 
number, 40 or 50 of us, and we lived in a barrack kind

03:27.176 --> 03:48.606
of thing, and it had no windows, but it was 
screened, and bunk beds, and a common bath, and

03:27.176 --> 03:48.606
there were probably a half dozen upperclassmen 
that were there, and I guess they were taking

03:27.176 --> 03:48.606
courses as well, but they were predominantly 
there for supervision. And I took biology and a

03:49.362 --> 03:51.926
lab. And I took, seemed like it was an English 
course and got a PE credit. So I came out with

03:57.674 --> 04:02.822
probably three or four credits through that 
science and another three credits for the

03:57.674 --> 04:02.822
English. And I ended up with a strong B throughout. 
So that got me in without a problem. And of that

04:07.909 --> 04:14.138
group, there were probably 12 or so in my cabin or my 
barrack. And probably... Eight or nine of those

04:17.797 --> 04:23.963
made it to A&M, and I bet there wasn't of those 12, 
two or three of us eventually graduated. Things

04:24.364 --> 04:25.024
happen. I can remember that it's a summer camp feel 
and really heavy on physical. I'm a runner, and I

04:31.771 --> 04:33.553
was a runner at the time. I was the first guy I can 
remember at that semester to be able to run up to the

04:33.613 --> 04:43.042
cross, which was about a five mile up and five mile 
back. And you go up at the top, there's this big

04:43.102 --> 04:46.926
cross at the top of the junction. Then we got a group 
together, and we'd run it about every other day,

04:47.378 --> 04:51.985
because it got to be then at YDD Special. It was just 
a fun time. They had a big creek and river that went

04:53.887 --> 05:00.797
through there, and we had some swimming 
certification that we had to do. And once

05:00.877 --> 05:07.707
everybody knew that they could swim, then it was a 
matter of pushing that program as far as we could.

05:08.127 --> 05:09.570
We were in and out of the water all the time. There 
were wild turkey. I remember wild turkey roaming

05:10.591 --> 05:13.195
around all the time. Deer. And then I can remember 
the... the uh the uh shaving cream fights and the

05:17.180 --> 05:44.959
restroom you know having a common bath with all 
those guys it was just you know running around in

05:17.180 --> 05:44.959
underwear and things that you just couldn't do 
normally and food was great and the atmosphere it

05:17.180 --> 05:44.959
was hot but you were never sweating you know and i'd 
probably go back to junction and i'd drip all the

05:17.180 --> 05:44.959
time but just something about i guess it's just 
your expectations and it just the whole thing was

05:17.180 --> 05:44.959
right and you'd go into town and the town was two 
streets And you'd feel like you went into San

05:45.327 --> 05:49.611
Antonio, you know, because you've just been 
confined in this little deal. But I had the

05:49.631 --> 05:55.036
opportunity about a year and a half ago, I made a 
special trip as I was going to San Antonio to go

05:49.631 --> 05:55.036
through Junction. And to drive down that road and 
see, I think Texas Tech owns it now. And it looked

05:59.199 --> 06:04.944
like it was some kind of a researcher or teacher 
development deal or something. And it was a

06:04.964 --> 06:06.526
little, it was sad. Not that it didn't look good, 
but it was sad not that it wasn't the way it was. Do

06:10.149 --> 06:12.471
you remember who the teachers were in those two 
courses? Absolutely not. I couldn't help you one

06:13.992 --> 06:15.013
out. I know we dissected frogs and animals and that 
kind of thing. I just don't remember the details.

06:20.655 --> 06:23.898
What, Louie Hauer in English or Bill Barzak? 
Wasn't either of those. Just too many years, I'll

06:26.500 --> 06:29.022
tell you. Because I've never heard anything but 
positive about Junction, the Junction

06:29.042 --> 06:36.549
experience by the youngsters who were out there. 
Describe a typical day. What time did you get up? It

06:41.194 --> 06:44.697
was an early morning day, but it was early morning 
like Sunday. 6.30 to 7, and no formation or

06:45.605 --> 06:49.449
anything. And I think breakfast was, they almost 
required you to have breakfast. I don't recall. I

06:54.253 --> 06:55.454
just remember I always had breakfast. I'm not a big 
breakfast eater. And you would, it seemed like

06:57.416 --> 07:08.887
you'd do classes all morning, and then the 
afternoon would tend to fletch between some kind

06:57.416 --> 07:08.887
of academic and some kind of extracurricular 
activity. All right, what about the biology lab?

07:10.588 --> 07:11.629
Did you do that in the afternoon? Ah. Gosh, that was 
1960. 30 years ago. I would tend to say we did it in

07:19.275 --> 07:21.840
the morning. It seemed like the morning was pretty 
much academic time. And the afternoons, I can

07:25.808 --> 07:31.760
remember the afternoons were so hot that, again, 
we didn't sweat, but they were hot. And I can

07:32.301 --> 07:36.148
remember you did have some nap time on your own, or 
you just had free time. But you could take a nap, or

07:36.483 --> 07:41.068
you could go for a run, or you could go down to the 
river, or just do whatever you wanted to do. It

07:41.088 --> 07:42.990
wasn't every hour regimented. I guess if they were 
old enough then, that would be time that we would

07:43.530 --> 07:48.235
use as our own responsibility. Now, you mentioned 
a little bit of playing around with shaving cream

07:48.255 --> 07:51.979
and things like that. Were there any things that 
happened that now, in retrospect, that were in bad

07:52.520 --> 08:01.069
taste, too extreme? No, no. I would think, of what I 
recall, the things we did at A&M by choice were a

08:04.681 --> 08:14.893
notch more than we did at Junction. Junction was 
kind of a coming out time, and I think we might have

08:14.913 --> 08:22.822
had a little reservation, a little less 
confidence in ourselves maybe than we did when we

08:14.913 --> 08:22.822
got to A&M. But it was all a good humor, tame thing. 
So you did six weeks there and then went home, then

08:26.386 --> 08:31.352
came back in the fall to A&M. Right. Did you come in 
that little MG? I came in the MG, yeah. You remember

08:39.752 --> 08:51.969
it took about, it had windows that were screwed in 
instead of rolled up, and it took about three weeks

08:39.752 --> 08:51.969
before one of my windows was taken, and it took 
about another three weeks before one of the

08:39.752 --> 08:51.969
tachometers was taken. It just wasn't a good time 
to have a sports car in a place like Texas A&M. I was

08:57.357 --> 09:00.201
definitely on the cutting edge of European cars. 
And you were in the Corps. right so that what what

09:04.283 --> 09:17.972
gear did you bring what kind of stuff

09:04.283 --> 09:17.972
but

09:18.880 --> 09:21.544
I've been forewarned that they just don't allow a 
whole lot. And I didn't bring much. And I had kind of

09:23.066 --> 09:26.231
an unusual and unfortunate circumstance. We 
came, I think, about a week early or five days

09:26.251 --> 09:28.735
early. And about three days into that, my 
grandmother passed away unexpectedly. And so I

09:35.666 --> 09:37.468
had to leave for a couple days for the funeral. And 
when I came back, classes were in session. And

09:40.052 --> 09:47.183
everybody, it was a little tough because the other 
freshmen had another two or three days to work on

09:40.052 --> 09:47.183
traditions. how to do things, and I kind of had to 
pop in midstream, and people that didn't know me

09:47.517 --> 09:53.664
didn't give me that benefit of the doubt. So it was a 
sink or swim for the first week there, but I caught

09:53.684 --> 09:58.190
on fire. Describe your outfit and where you lived 
and so forth. Hellcat 9, which is no longer there,

10:05.338 --> 10:16.832
and it was a tight group, but the seniors were, you 
didn't know the seniors, they were, I don't know

10:17.420 --> 10:24.590
how it is today, but you just didn't allow the 
camaraderie with the older folks. Juniors, you

10:24.610 --> 10:26.553
knew a little bit, like 20%. Seniors, you might 
have known less than 5%. Juniors, 20%, 25%. And

10:30.739 --> 10:33.002
then the sophomores, you knew them 90%. They were 
your face all the time. And I can remember, I mean,

10:36.147 --> 10:43.077
there was hazing, but it's nothing that we didn't 
all involve in and enjoy. But you wouldn't know.

10:46.090 --> 10:47.111
You wouldn't go to the toilet. You'd tend to use 
your sink if you could. Just because you didn't

10:50.194 --> 10:54.378
want to get out and have to hit the wall and answer 12 
questions and do another 73 push-ups. I was class

10:54.458 --> 10:59.062
of 73, so that was the push-ups and set-ups I was 
doing all the time. But I could rattle them off

10:59.082 --> 11:00.323
pretty good. But you just didn't get out any more 
than you had to. So you arrived in the fall of 60?

11:07.890 --> 11:10.393
Fall of 69.

11:12.074 --> 11:15.237
Describe a typical weekday for you that freshman 
year? What did it begin and what happened go

11:18.392 --> 11:22.537
through the whole day? It seemed like they woke us 
up with a normal chime up and down the hall. One of

11:29.786 --> 11:35.914
the freshmen would have to do his rhyme.

11:38.057 --> 11:39.479
I can't remember the rhyme. But they'd wake you up 
going up and down the hall and you'd have 15 or 20

11:42.993 --> 12:00.917
minutes to get ready, and there was enough chaos 
that you probably didn't get hazed that 15 or 20

11:42.993 --> 12:00.917
minutes because everybody was running to showers 
and using the toilet and that kind of thing, and

11:42.993 --> 12:00.917
you'd be on the wall, and you'd spend probably at 
least 5, no more than 10 minutes on the wall, and

11:42.993 --> 12:00.917
you'd have to be speaking Spanish all the way up and 
down. And I was one of the few that bought Corfam

12:01.698 --> 12:05.643
shoes. That's when Corfam came out. And I was able 
to get, I bet I didn't know five people that got

12:07.428 --> 12:12.012
through their whole freshman year with Corfam 
shoes. Because if the upperclassmen found out you

12:12.032 --> 12:16.597
did, oh, they would, we'd get thrown away. But if 
you could save them, it sure saved a lot of shiny

12:16.637 --> 12:20.581
time. And I had Corfam shoes, which helped me a lot. 
I also didn't change my bed sheets the first,

12:23.063 --> 12:28.789
probably, well, until Christmas. And I took them 
home Christmas holiday, and I had to throw them

12:29.590 --> 12:32.693
away. What I would do is keep everything tucked 
very tight and slide in very gingerly. and then

12:37.786 --> 12:38.867
slide out. And I guess I wouldn't turn over at 
night, because I never screwed up my tuck. But you

12:43.432 --> 12:43.933
would. They didn't wash real well that semester. 
But back in the day, you'd have your five or 10

12:48.097 --> 12:57.868
minutes of up against the wall, and the sophomores 
quizzing you, and a few juniors walking down, just

12:48.097 --> 12:57.868
kind of giving you a hard time. Then you'd go out in 
formation. They would probably question you

12:59.850 --> 13:05.076
another five minutes, and then you'd have

13:06.085 --> 13:11.611
the wake-up call and everything, and then you'd 
march to the, is it Sabisa Hall? Were you at

13:11.631 --> 13:13.032
Northgate or Southgate? Were you at Northside or 
the, or was it Duncan? Duncan, Duncan, not Sabisa,

13:16.336 --> 13:18.798
Duncan. Duncan, you'd go to Duncan, and you'd 
have, the meal would be, it would be difficult the

13:18.878 --> 13:32.232
first ten minutes, and then the upperclassmen 
would get to eat, and then you'd eat, and then you'd

13:18.878 --> 13:32.232
come back, and most of the upperclassmen were out 
of the way because they were already in the room.

13:32.733 --> 13:34.995
You'd hustle in your room, hope you wouldn't get 
delayed, get your books, get on the class. And then

13:37.557 --> 13:39.740
the day was pretty tame. I mean, you just kind of 
kept your nose clean. It was fine. And then at

13:43.286 --> 13:51.881
dinner time, you would have to go in formation 
again, same routine, march to dinner, and come

13:43.286 --> 13:51.881
back. And I can remember that you had until 7.30 
before you had to do your study. And you would study

13:58.833 --> 14:01.337
from 7.30 to 10.00. And then there were like 30 
minutes of free time, but nobody left the rooms

14:01.790 --> 14:09.784
because they didn't want to get hazed, but you'd 
call or the phone would do whatever. And then at

14:09.804 --> 14:19.761
10.30, the lights out, unless you could get an 
upperclassman to allow you to maybe use a small

14:09.804 --> 14:19.761
minor's pipeline or something to continue 
studying. If you had any free time in the

14:19.781 --> 14:24.810
afternoons, any unscheduled time, what did you 
do? you know academically i had to work hard there

14:27.018 --> 14:52.637
were a lot of other ones that became easier to and i i 
used a lot of my afternoon studying where um

14:27.018 --> 14:52.637
usually i either use they had i don't know what 
they're called but they're small little retreats

14:27.018 --> 14:52.637
between the dorms this kind of common area and i 
would find a corner and everybody leave you alone

14:27.018 --> 14:52.637
to go pretty well or i would use the library And if I 
use a library a lot, but if I had free time, I still

14:53.427 --> 15:07.268
like to run and I will run most every day and I will 
try to do that in the afternoon and get away from

14:53.427 --> 15:07.268
just get away from the dorms for an hour a day. Was 
your freshman roommate a special person as you

15:07.288 --> 15:10.713
look back? Did y'all have a Yeah, he remains one I'm 
in contact with. He's a pilot for American

15:15.740 --> 15:18.044
Airlines. I just had him for the first And then in my 
sophomore year, I got a second roommate. I had one

15:27.159 --> 15:29.303
or two roommates that I'm still close with. At the 
very first of my freshman year, I settled in after

15:29.403 --> 15:32.529
about a month. Had him all freshman year. Remain 
close to him to this day. And then I had a new

15:36.336 --> 15:41.666
roommate that graduated with me, and he's a pilot 
for Continental and Guam. And he remained in the

15:42.167 --> 15:43.009
club. Make believe that I had never heard about 
chow hall routine and food and so forth. Describe

15:52.675 --> 15:57.920
A&M chow hall habits and food and so forth. Well, I 
ate well because I didn't, I wasn't afraid of the

15:58.080 --> 16:02.484
system. I enjoyed the system. And I found ways to 
get around the system and to abuse the

16:04.266 --> 16:13.114
upperclassmen that pushed the system as much as I 
could get away with it. So I would kind of put myself

16:13.347 --> 16:17.191
in the forefront. And by doing that, that might 
have picked on you at first and quizzed you a lot the

16:17.211 --> 16:31.906
initial part of the meal because you had to stay at 
attention and you had to square your bites and you

16:17.211 --> 16:31.906
had to ask for food by the name, the alien name, and 
ask in a certain way. And if you go ahead and jump

16:32.607 --> 16:40.975
into that and do it, they tend to leave you alone 
more than the guy that's kind of mild and meek and

16:32.607 --> 16:40.975
fat and calorie. And by doing that, I ate well, and 
then they would leave, and I would eat even better.

16:47.963 --> 16:56.895
And if there was an upperclassman that was giving 
me a hard time, I would find a way to use the system to

16:47.963 --> 16:56.895
help me get back to him. And it's nothing of a total 
aggressive type of way, but it's just more of a

16:57.276 --> 17:08.430
competitive spirit that the Corps created at that 
time, and I assume still has today. What were some

17:08.680 --> 17:12.947
of the food names, nicknames? Spuds. Bullneck was 
meat. Cow was

17:18.797 --> 17:27.291
milk. Bread.

17:30.356 --> 17:31.077
Was that dill? Still, that's exactly what it is. I 
don't remember, but that's exactly what it was.

17:35.357 --> 17:38.502
Did iced tea or coffee have a nickname? If so, I 
don't recall. See, I'm not a coffee drinker, so

17:41.848 --> 17:45.554
that's why I wouldn't have thought about it. I 
don't remember when it happened. What about

17:48.178 --> 17:52.084
things like green beans or mash? Yeah, mash. They 
had names. They had names, but I just can't

17:55.630 --> 17:56.912
remember. And I've heard that a few freshmen got in 
trouble at home at Thanksgiving when they slipped

17:57.668 --> 18:07.198
and asked for a certain food. There were some, and I 
can't tell what they were, but there were some

18:07.238 --> 18:11.983
foods that had edgy names. Yes. And I did it. I just 
know I did because everything else slipped out one

18:14.585 --> 18:19.671
time or the other. You'd get around other people 
and it would just really be bad. Were there any,

18:24.196 --> 18:30.343
I'll call it games, were there any games played by 
you and your fish buddies at the table? Any things

18:30.503 --> 18:36.049
that y'all did maybe to get back at sophomores or 
other upperclassmen? Yeah, and some I wouldn't

18:36.769 --> 18:38.171
repeat. Oh, okay. But it all kind of worked out, and 
I can remember putting gravy on the shoes, and

18:38.551 --> 18:49.663
they'd make you sit under the table if you did 
something wrong, and I'd have a pass food down, and

18:38.551 --> 18:49.663
I'd take up the sides of your sole with mashed 
potatoes or something. And they wouldn't catch it

18:53.873 --> 18:57.278
until later and not have any idea how it happened. 
And I will tell you that we were able to put things in

18:57.298 --> 19:05.309
the food and whatnot just so that at least we'd feel 
better about buying it. But to this day, they don't

19:05.329 --> 19:06.831
know. So it all kind of worked out. Let's see. You

19:09.422 --> 19:14.870
mentioned the name of your outfit. Do you hold that 
outfit closely in your heart? Yeah, I do. It's real

19:22.341 --> 19:23.422
tough, though. You go back. I've been back five or 
six times. Since there isn't a squad of

19:26.727 --> 19:31.554
nine-year-olds, it kind of pulls at you. You go 
back to the dorm that you were in and find your room.

19:36.607 --> 20:00.259
As

19:36.607 --> 20:00.259
you

19:36.607 --> 20:00.259
went to class, did you and your friends have a 
routine about class, where to sit, what to carry to

19:36.607 --> 20:00.259
class, how to make contact with the instructor?

20:03.264 --> 20:04.285
I don't remember that being anything that 
specific. I remember getting the class, you would

20:04.838 --> 20:14.973
quickly learn what would be the least suggestive 
way to get to class. And you would also, you'd have a

20:14.993 --> 20:23.365
way of walking by someone with them really 
wondering if you did see them. Because if they did

20:23.385 --> 20:28.353
think you saw them and not speak, well, you would be 
in trouble. But you knew half the guys you'd speak

20:28.373 --> 20:32.679
to would slow you down, so you didn't want to speak 
to them half the time. So you'd find ways to dodge

20:32.699 --> 20:34.542
things and Did

20:34.859 --> 21:04.427
you have any classes that freshman year that, as 
you look back, either the subject or the

20:34.859 --> 21:04.427
instructor was very important to you?

21:05.167 --> 21:24.569
I got the feeling most of them were all way too big 
and just a little harder than they needed to be to

21:05.167 --> 21:24.569
the degree that I think they were really trying to 
lead us on. And the professors had two to three

21:24.589 --> 21:28.534
hundred people, which was like chemistry, 
history, math was a little smaller than math was

21:24.589 --> 21:28.534
good, English was a reasonable size. But I just 
felt like that AEM's criteria to get in was pretty

21:28.554 --> 21:33.199
easy in those days. All

21:33.854 --> 21:45.771
right, but you were saying that the Junction 
helped you get in school. How academically, how

21:46.271 --> 21:48.715
well did you do that first year? I did fine. I was 
probably in fine relative. I mean, for me, I was

21:53.241 --> 21:56.766
just happy to be there and stay there. I probably 
had a three, five, six, seven, something like

21:57.387 --> 22:02.494
that. And I can remember of the, we had a map that 
somewhere in the city for 35 and 40 freshmen

22:02.609 --> 22:16.714
started. And we had, I think the number was 13 of 
them graduated. So, although that sounds like

22:20.580 --> 22:23.806
maybe a big number, it's too sad because I can think 
back to the other 25, 30 kids, and they were all

22:20.580 --> 22:23.806
great kids. And just the circumstances were 
different in these places. Please share, if you

22:26.116 --> 22:32.665
can, some jokes, pranks, good bull, that you and 
other freshmen pulled off.

22:36.169 --> 22:52.731
I can remember having

22:36.169 --> 22:52.731
an opportunity to wake up in the morning and a 
junior or senior came to you and said he wanted you

22:36.169 --> 22:52.731
to be a fellow junior or senior. you could do that in 
Puerto Rico and see who you are and everything

22:53.183 --> 22:58.609
else. And they couldn't get back at you because, in 
fact, you were a messenger from someone else, but

22:58.629 --> 23:06.176
they didn't know who it was, which is a big mystery. 
And I can remember, I can remember recording one

23:06.196 --> 23:15.866
guy with me, and he was one of the biggest, toughest 
guys in the world. And me and a couple of guys came in

23:15.886 --> 23:17.588
at 2 a.m. and flipped on the lights. And

23:18.378 --> 23:25.209
he was a scared person. And it was just amazing to 
see a 252 or 275 pound guy that was three or four

23:25.529 --> 23:37.868
years older grabbing on the edge of his bed, just 
pleading me not to take him out of the room. And we

23:37.888 --> 23:38.610
would, and we'd take him out. But probably one of 
the better ones I can remember was the stripper guy

23:38.630 --> 23:44.078
who had a longer sack coming from one of the lights 
out front. And we did it about 5, 5.30, and the

23:44.098 --> 23:45.280
formation was about

23:49.799 --> 24:12.465
what

23:49.799 --> 24:12.465
retribution

23:49.799 --> 24:12.465
did he wreak on you perpetrators

23:49.799 --> 24:12.465
typically

24:15.027 --> 24:26.499
There's just a limited amount they could do as far 
as quizzing you or making you do cooking. You know,

24:26.579 --> 24:29.663
my freshman year, I was like 100, and I could do 
1,000 servings. So there's nothing they could do

24:29.683 --> 24:33.206
to really amuse me, and there's no question, 
lore-wise, traditionalizing that. So there's

24:33.227 --> 24:36.150
just not a whole lot they could do. They could sure 
try, but by Thanksgiving, you were so much in the

24:36.270 --> 24:40.514
system that you were going to make it. Nothing 
bothered you. And they could kind of tell, and

24:42.316 --> 24:44.899
there's really not a whole lot they could do. Did 
your squadron commander's footlocker

24:45.588 --> 24:49.453
disappear? He did, and we did. We'd walk up and run 
the hall for a couple hours, and we had steam

24:50.915 --> 25:02.208
showers half a dozen times. And we probably had a 
couple baths before that. We probably had one or

25:03.870 --> 25:14.143
two baths, but I knew that it was, you know, it was 
also part of that business position deal that, you

25:03.870 --> 25:14.143
know, being a runner, I was always, this was back in 
the 60s when being in strength wasn't so big of a

25:03.870 --> 25:14.143
deal. I enjoyed that kind of time. And so, to me, I 
always look at that in myself as, well, I'll give

25:17.330 --> 25:22.394
myself a better shot at this. All right, now, how 
did you all get the locker? We had, at the time, we

25:25.857 --> 25:33.805
probably had about 30 guys there. And we assigned 
responsibilities for each of the guys. And we took

25:40.851 --> 25:41.231
a seat. Our senior, he was a leader. really

25:42.254 --> 25:59.652
sharp,

25:42.254 --> 25:59.652
polished kind of guy. And so we

25:59.672 --> 26:06.439
took him out, and they did about two miles out of 
town. They did give him a bath. And they let him off

26:08.401 --> 26:09.762
about 2 a.m., just in the middle of the garden. And 
he didn't get bathed until about 4 a.m. or 8 p.m. So

26:11.448 --> 26:35.926
did you take the locker while he was out? Yeah. 
Where did y'all have the locker? I wasn't in charge

26:38.903 --> 26:41.726
of that. I don't remember that. I was in charge. I 
was one of the guys that got him and took him out to

26:44.769 --> 26:49.413
the car. Did the footlocker reappear at 
Thanksgiving? The footlocker did reappear at

26:52.155 --> 26:57.641
Thanksgiving. But there was some definite time 
there. That's right. There was some pretty strong

27:02.505 --> 27:05.468
hazing going on in between. until they did appear. 
But we held them as long as we needed to hold them. It

27:09.400 --> 27:11.603
wasn't like we cowered in front of them. What about 
drownouts? Were there any drownouts in your out

27:12.784 --> 27:16.087
that much? Would a drownout be in the room? 
Throwing water in the room, turning the sex on and

27:21.292 --> 27:26.357
leaving them on in that country? Or dumping water 
on them while they were asleep? We did some of that.

27:29.520 --> 27:33.324
I can remember one guy we did that. We spent all week 
doing that. We filled up his room How deep

27:35.047 --> 27:44.257
was it? The whole

27:44.617 --> 27:49.562
room was full. He opened the door, and it fell into 
the hall, and you couldn't see six inches in the

27:50.083 --> 27:55.529
room. It was full of building paper. We did a few 
duck walks, and we spent hours on that one, too.

28:03.447 --> 28:08.296
Were you all then assigned to clean it up since you 
were freshmen? No, he didn't know he did it. And we

28:11.783 --> 28:17.613
really kept it quiet long enough to get it passed 
until a point where we really didn't have a problem

28:11.783 --> 28:17.613
with it. That's how great it is. All right. What was 
it like to be a sophomore the next year? It was

28:23.605 --> 28:24.506
heavy. I didn't really get off on it.

28:37.771 --> 28:59.683
I

28:37.771 --> 28:59.683
enjoyed

28:37.771 --> 28:59.683
my outfit. I started enjoying some of the guys. It 
was more better. I can remember my freshman year, I

29:00.844 --> 29:02.827
couldn't have anything on my wall except for the 
bulletin board. It had to be a bulletin board. My

29:03.468 --> 29:04.349
sophomore year, they let me have a radio. They let 
me have a small plug-in radio. But you still

29:05.171 --> 29:05.912
couldn't have a stereo. You couldn't have the 
outfits. You could have In the

29:07.471 --> 29:36.364
academics, look at the whole time you were there, 
who were, as you look back now, some important

29:07.471 --> 29:36.364
teachers, advisors, counselors, that

29:37.070 --> 30:02.524
affected you? He really enjoyed seeing me learn 
that he I

30:05.993 --> 30:28.364
was too busy to look beyond and to think, well, if I 
get this guy, this grade, how am I going to get this?

30:28.384 --> 30:29.145
Because he's a judge of every service. And that 
kind of tainted my feeling to him that as a

30:29.165 --> 30:31.228
professor, he would explain it better than 
anyone. And I had a professor prior to him that must

30:31.248 --> 30:33.350
have been my dad, must have had a program in my 
junior year. And I had a fellow in my sophomore

30:33.370 --> 30:34.532
year, my freshman year, Thank

30:36.233 --> 31:02.882
you.

31:10.895 --> 31:22.508
When

31:10.895 --> 31:22.508
did you turn away from oceanography?
