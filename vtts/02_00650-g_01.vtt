WEBVTT

00:02.343 --> 00:17.882
But about, I guess, I would say

00:02.343 --> 00:17.882
a large part of the essential observations, 
measurements from these periods. Ewing also

00:17.902 --> 00:21.566
contributed basically two things. One was his 
hypothesis that the mid-ocean ridge was a

00:21.667 --> 00:31.118
continuous phenomenon throughout all the 
oceans. and his idea, his claim that there was a

00:32.262 --> 00:44.280
crack down the middle of it, which was being filled 
with volcanic material. The other major

00:44.300 --> 00:49.467
observation he made was the Ecclesiastical

00:44.300 --> 00:49.467
Plains. Now, you once suggested too, or at least I 
read and assumed you had suggested, that the

00:49.487 --> 00:59.502
oceans are the ultimate receptacle of the waste of 
land. Okay. Does that also apply to radioactive

01:02.431 --> 01:04.574
waste? Twice you've mentioned that in the course 
of the interview yesterday. Did I? Mm-hmm. You

01:11.302 --> 01:18.291
said that twice you were explaining that on bombs 
and waste as they were being involved and they're

01:11.302 --> 01:18.291
coming off the Apto. Oh, yeah. That was part of 
our... What we were interested in there was not...

01:24.153 --> 01:53.130
disposal of those things but what happened what 
happened to them and and then later on yesterday

01:24.153 --> 01:53.130
also you mentioned the fact that that nuclear 
energy uh worries now a lot of people and i assume by

01:24.153 --> 01:53.130
that too you were speaking of disposal of waste of 
nuclear energy well i'm speaking of several

01:24.153 --> 01:53.130
things there one of them is the danger of accidents 
nuclear reactor another is the disposal of the

01:24.153 --> 01:53.130
ways which is sometimes called the faustian 
bargain We're not going to be here for a long, long

01:53.752 --> 01:56.615
time. Maybe we'll outlast our civilization. If 
so, you're putting an awful burden on future

02:01.660 --> 02:05.664
generations. The third is the problem of what's 
called the safeguard problem, the problem of

02:05.684 --> 02:20.119
plutonium, which is made in reactors and can be 
used to make, fairly easily used to make atomic

02:05.684 --> 02:20.119
weapons.

02:20.139 --> 02:21.160
The one part of that that that you're asking me now. 
Is it possible to dispose of radioactive waste?

02:30.150 --> 02:31.552
Walter Monk is engaged in this. He's just 
beginning a study of this.

02:36.780 --> 02:49.358
And he thinks it is possible, essentially by 
burying them in bottom sediments in

02:36.780 --> 02:49.358
such a way that The heat produced by the 
radioactivity can get out, but the radioactivity

02:51.025 --> 03:00.215
can't

02:51.025 --> 03:00.215
get out. Whether that's possible or not, I don't 
know. That's always been a problem with these kind

03:02.737 --> 03:15.211
of things, that the fission products are so high 
radioactive and the absorption of the

03:02.737 --> 03:15.211
radioactive radiation produces heat. And it 
produces a lot of heat. You've got to find a way to

03:18.464 --> 03:26.073
get rid of that heat and retain the radioactive 
material. Keep the radioactivity away from

03:26.834 --> 03:32.100
hurting anybody or anything. Those are sort of 
incompatible objectives. You have to keep the

03:37.306 --> 03:47.998
radioactivity enclosed in something that will 
absorb all the radioactivity. like a big lead box.

03:50.521 --> 03:54.306
That big lead box is also a very poor conductor of 
heat. So the thing tends to get awfully hot.

03:59.952 --> 04:15.792
But it may very well be that in the long run, we'll 
come to the ocean as an ocean bottom sediment in an

03:59.952 --> 04:15.792
undisturbed area as a means of disposing of 
radioactive waves as an alternative to the

03:59.952 --> 04:15.792
present favorite of the atomic. energy people, 
which is salt, old salt mines.

04:21.653 --> 04:25.318
Of course, the other alternative is not to have too 
many nuclear reactors. That, I must say, I'm in

04:25.338 --> 04:29.863
favor of not having the darn thing. I now feel that 
solar energy is a much more rational alternative

04:29.883 --> 04:41.357
of all of my sources of energy.

04:42.940 --> 04:53.735
One of the great resources of the ocean is not 
generally appreciated is the fact that it is a

04:42.940 --> 04:53.735
great hole in the ground, a way to get rid of a lot of 
garbage that human beings produce. And much of the

04:56.138 --> 04:59.162
garbage that you can dump into the ocean is 
actually beneficial.

05:02.026 --> 05:09.657
For example, if you dump nutrients like phosphate 
and nitrate into the ocean, that may actually

05:10.227 --> 05:18.757
encourage the growth of organisms that we like to 
eat, like fish and marine invertebrates.

05:21.620 --> 05:24.644
It's not at all a one-way proposition. These guys 
that say you can't pollute the ocean at all, I

05:24.664 --> 05:30.531
think, are just really not thinking very clearly. 
The ocean's always been polluted by human

05:30.551 --> 05:37.879
activities, and if we do it right, we're not going 
to hurt it. We may help it. On the other hand,

05:40.214 --> 05:48.181
there's some things that we may be putting in that 
are harmful, some trace materials, some

05:40.214 --> 05:48.181
poisonous chemicals. For a while, it was thought 
that DDT was one of these things that might

05:48.201 --> 05:55.327
accumulate at the surface of the ocean. But it's 
soluble in oil.

06:02.694 --> 06:09.360
And that that would interfere with the 
photosynthesis of plankton, and thereby maybe do

06:02.694 --> 06:09.360
something to the fish body. to the fish 
production. It seems that DDT doesn't accumulate

06:12.043 --> 06:15.407
near the surface very much. It's not clear what 
does happen to it.

06:26.659 --> 06:33.627
But one can think of things like that that might be 
harmful to the plankton organisms and to the fish,

06:26.659 --> 06:33.627
certainly.

06:36.678 --> 06:49.156
In shallow waters and in semi-enclosed waters, 
you can do all sorts of mind-building, like the

06:36.678 --> 06:49.156
Minamoto disease in Japan, which is too much metal 
mercury in shallow water. It got into the fish and

06:49.216 --> 06:55.986
into people and had very serious health effects.

07:05.078 --> 07:13.107
And you also have problems with sewage sludge, 
which settles to the bottom and seems to create an

07:05.078 --> 07:13.107
environment that very few creatures can live in. 
It changes the ecology from the various kinds of

07:14.329 --> 07:24.100
wide variety of invertebrates to a small number of 
rather disgusting invertebrates like worms.

07:30.928 --> 07:32.470
Do you think there ought to be some sort of of a 
beginning on ways to control the waste dumping in

07:32.872 --> 07:36.256
the ocean? Would you designate a national problem 
that should have national priorities? Well, we

07:43.265 --> 07:44.087
are doing it. Too much, I think.

07:51.096 --> 07:53.299
I think it's always a good idea to know what you're 
doing. It's a good idea to look at these outfalls,

07:53.359 --> 07:58.305
these waste outfalls.

07:59.956 --> 08:06.826
see what happens to the material and whether it's 
beneficial or

07:59.956 --> 08:06.826
harmful. But I'm not really, I'm not at all in 
agreement with Cousteau who says we're killing

08:06.846 --> 08:15.038
the ocean. I don't really think we are killing the 
ocean. You ought

08:18.984 --> 08:23.411
to talk to John Isaacs about that. Now, I have 
another quote that I'd like for you to comment on.

08:26.315 --> 08:27.617
You suggested one time in and some things that 
you'd written, that scientists should be

08:27.935 --> 08:31.579
involved in politics. Do you still believe that 
scientists should be more or less active

08:33.421 --> 08:38.907
politically? Well, when I said involved with 
politics, I don't think I meant that they should be

08:38.927 --> 08:43.412
politicians. Oh, no. I assumed you meant to 
influence, as a matter of fact, political

08:44.793 --> 08:49.959
decisions. I think that politicians and 
scientists have got to learn how to work together.

08:54.544 --> 08:57.807
I wrote my presidential address at AAAS, was 
called a politician in the sciences. Did you see

09:00.947 --> 09:01.628
that? There's really nothing that I can say that I 
didn't say there. But I meant every word of that.

09:10.120 --> 09:23.558
And I basically mean that

09:10.120 --> 09:23.558
our world is changing so rapidly because of 
changing technology and increasing knowledge.

09:25.208 --> 09:42.554
It's very complex effects in terms of population 
growth, resource depletion,

09:25.208 --> 09:42.554
changes of ways of life and social changes that 
result from those changes in the ways of life, like

09:25.208 --> 09:42.554
urbanization.

09:47.281 --> 09:51.047
But politicians need to have as good an 
understanding as possible as they can of what

09:52.529 --> 10:02.339
their options are and what the probabilities are. 
The difficulty here is that politicians and

10:02.359 --> 10:08.725
scientists are different kinds of people. And 
they're quite different in many important

10:08.745 --> 10:12.289
respects. But the fundamental difference is that 
the politician always has to act. He has to make a

10:16.733 --> 10:20.697
decision regardless of whether it's based on 
knowledge or just based on an intuition or a hunch

10:21.284 --> 10:26.910
or a gamble. You've got to do something. Not doing 
anything is really the same as doing something in

10:28.352 --> 10:32.696
many cases. The result of this necessity to act and 
the lack of sufficient information to act on is

10:34.899 --> 10:48.954
that politicians always make short-range 
decisions. And they try to leave it. future

10:50.647 --> 10:52.749
options open as much as they can. The only thing 
they can do. That's reinforced in the democratic

10:54.852 --> 11:03.181
society by the fact that the poor bachelors have to 
run for election every two years. So that some

11:03.202 --> 11:10.330
people say that infinity to a politician is the 
election after the next one. But it's true of all

11:10.350 --> 11:17.498
politicians, even if they're dictators or have 
some kind of a legitimacy not based on election.

11:19.688 --> 11:22.933
just because of the nature of the problem that they 
face. Whereas a scientist never wants to act. He

11:25.977 --> 11:32.025
always wants to find out more before acting.

11:32.045 --> 11:39.275
And he always feels that he doesn't know enough to 
be able to make a positive statement. Well, the way

11:39.295 --> 11:48.548
to get around this, I think, is that politicians 
and scientists both have to learn to think more in

11:49.608 --> 11:57.660
statistical terms, in terms of probabilities, in 
ranges of probabilities. Take a simple case.

11:59.763 --> 12:03.689
What's the population of the United States going 
to be in the year 2000? Well, the probability is

12:05.272 --> 12:15.387
that, let's say, 50% that it'll be 230 million 
people, plus or minus 5 million. The probability

12:16.428 --> 12:18.872
is maybe 20% that it'll somewhere between 240 and 
220 million people. Probability is maybe 10%.

12:27.981 --> 12:37.573
It'll be somewhere between 245 and 210 million 
people, and so forth. And one has to prepare for

12:37.993 --> 12:47.745
this range of probabilities as best one can, not 
saying Not saying we're going to plan for 230

12:48.232 --> 12:51.976
million people, plus or minus . But that is the most 
likely thing to do. So we want to put most of our

12:55.981 --> 12:59.786
effort into preparing for that. Less effort, but 
some effort into preparing for more or less, in

13:00.447 --> 13:07.895
accordance with our range of probabilities. And 
demographers have to learn to make their

13:07.915 --> 13:14.263
forecasts or their projections in terms of 
probabilities. But meteorologists have already

13:14.283 --> 13:16.045
learned this. Meteorologists say that the 
chances are 20% it's going to rain tomorrow, or

13:16.987 --> 13:23.373
they're 80%. Well, it never says 100% chance it's 
going to rain tomorrow, or zero chance it's going

13:24.554 --> 13:31.361
to rain tomorrow. But everybody who's concerned 
about the weather learns to act on these

13:31.381 --> 13:37.907
probabilities. And you try to take out insurance 
against the unlikely event occurring. some kind

13:43.987 --> 13:50.076
of insurance, either monetary insurance or 
alternate plans or something. Going on a picnic,

13:50.096 --> 13:58.908
you usually have to have an alternate plan, 
because you're dealing with probabilities.

13:58.928 --> 14:01.051
Unless you're . He's dead now, unfortunately.

14:08.202 --> 14:12.728
But the other thing that politicians and what 
scientists need to learn in order to work together

14:15.273 --> 14:22.780
is to understand

14:15.273 --> 14:22.780
how these two different groups of people think. 
Politicians like to use an adversary procedure,

14:24.582 --> 14:27.986
because they're mostly lawyers. Scientists take 
a very dim view of adversary procedures. They much

14:31.629 --> 14:42.580
prefer committee discussion, in which you pound 
out a kind of a consensus or compromise position,

14:31.629 --> 14:42.580
but not You don't simply present the argument on 
both sides and leave it to the politician to decide

14:43.218 --> 14:54.413
between

14:43.218 --> 14:54.413
those two sides. And both modes of operation have 
their place and their value, but they're

14:56.336 --> 15:03.285
different methods.

15:04.367 --> 15:09.934
Alvin Weinberg has talked about this a good deal, 
what he calls trans-scientific problems and

15:04.367 --> 15:09.934
trans-scientific problems. Transcience 
problems involve values that are not scientific.

15:16.949 --> 15:25.581
What you like, what you dislike, what you want, 
what you don't want, what you think is moral and

15:16.949 --> 15:25.581
what you think is immoral. None of these are 
scientific questions. You can't really argue

15:28.645 --> 15:33.732
about a scientific question, but you can argue 
about values. And the reason you can argue about

15:33.752 --> 15:40.782
values is that values are always in conflict, and 
you therefore have to analyze or to... to

15:41.808 --> 15:48.074
try to give relative weights to different values. 
You do this by argument.

15:52.438 --> 15:55.941
Science really is not an arguable subject. It's a 
subject which you either know or you don't know.

15:58.784 --> 16:03.328
Most of the time you don't know, but you do know 
some. The whole business of technology

16:03.348 --> 16:11.275
assessment is a good example of the way in which 
scientists Technologists and politicians need

16:11.963 --> 16:14.967
to interact. Another of them deals with policy for 
science.

16:22.596 --> 16:29.964
The politicians need to be convinced

16:22.596 --> 16:29.964
that science operates in a somewhat different way 
than they're used to. You can't go out and say, I'm

16:31.466 --> 16:33.769
going to make a discovery. I'm going to discover 
how to cure cancer. And maybe the best way to cure

16:37.633 --> 16:40.637
cancer is not to work on cancer at all. to work on the 
basic biology of the

16:41.393 --> 16:52.811
metabolism and the reproduction of cell 
reproduction.

16:56.557 --> 17:00.963
And this is hard for the politician to get through 
his head. He always is liable to say, what have you

17:01.144 --> 17:03.527
done for me lately? Well, you can't say what you've 
done for him lately. You've changed the world over

17:06.752 --> 17:09.156
the course of 100 years. But you don't know quite 
what's going to happen next. And this is the

17:13.999 --> 17:21.750
essence of scientific approach, very 
unsatisfactory to the politician, and vice

17:13.999 --> 17:21.750
versa. But these are all barriers and 
difficulties, constraints, in the way of

17:23.953 --> 17:32.606
scientists and politicians working together. It 
doesn't mean there's any less need for them to work

17:32.987 --> 17:37.654
together. Well, all of this you'll learn. I'm just 
saying, I'm just repeating what I said in that

17:38.954 --> 17:44.321
residential address. But you still essentially 
agree with that, you don't? Oh, sure. You've not

17:46.645 --> 17:48.407
changed your mind at all, okay. That was only a 
couple of years ago. People's minds change

17:50.730 --> 17:52.693
quickly, believe me. In 1958, you said the 
oceanography was far behind land sciences. Would

17:59.462 --> 18:01.725
you still agree with that? Do you think in the last 
18 years that that has changed?

18:16.889 --> 18:20.334
Oh, Athelstan Steelhouse used to put it pretty 
well. He said, we don't even know more about the

18:20.354 --> 18:31.849
moon's backside than we are about the ocean's 
bottom.

18:31.869 --> 18:32.369
I don't know. The

18:32.409 --> 18:39.699
ocean is a very much more difficult place to find 
out about than the land is.

18:43.524 --> 18:44.365
On the other hand,

18:54.352 --> 19:23.295
I guess

18:54.352 --> 19:23.295
I ask myself about the problems of land science and 
ocean science that are more or less related to each

18:54.352 --> 19:23.295
other, namely the ecological problems, the 
problems of climate and weather, the problems of

18:54.352 --> 19:23.295
geological processes on land and in the sea,

18:54.352 --> 19:23.295
the theological and geophysical processes.

19:33.687 --> 19:36.431
and consider the relative importance of the two. 
For example, food production is almost entirely a

19:38.815 --> 19:48.389
land science, only to a minor extent an ocean 
science. I guess with my broader perspective

19:48.409 --> 20:01.669
about agriculture and about food production

19:48.409 --> 20:01.669
and about the environment, which is, again, For 
most people, a land environment.

20:08.760 --> 20:27.663
I would say that on the problems that are important 
to people, the practical problem that affect

20:08.760 --> 20:27.663
people's lives in fundamental ways,

20:08.760 --> 20:27.663
the land signs are pretty backward, too. We have no 
idea how to predict climate. We can't predict

20:30.266 --> 20:31.808
weather more than about four or five days in 
advance. We don't really understand

20:35.197 --> 20:49.157
how ecosystems work on land any more than we do in 
the ocean. We don't

20:49.177 --> 21:00.293
know what we're doing to the environment on the 
land in many fundamental and important ways.

21:06.044 --> 21:09.768
So I guess it's compared to their odious in that 
case. In both areas, our ignorance is too large,

21:09.788 --> 21:18.599
too great. Well, the next two questions I have 
consider both of those areas I have listed on my

21:18.619 --> 21:24.946
question to ask you. Both hazard, as a matter of 
fact, a scientific guess.

21:33.382 --> 21:41.273
What do you suppose the development of the oceans 
in the immediate future, let's say, define the

21:33.382 --> 21:41.273
immediate future of the next 50 years will be? Will 
we concentrate more on mineral resources, food

21:41.693 --> 21:49.584
resources, or will we continue in this area of 
exploration of the oceans?

21:52.769 --> 22:01.060
I don't think we'll continue the exploration

21:52.769 --> 22:01.060
for a variety of reasons.

22:05.495 --> 22:09.880
One reason is the law of the sea conference is going 
to make it difficult. The other reason is that

22:10.821 --> 22:21.153
we've probably done most of the things, not 
everything, but most of the things we can with the

22:10.821 --> 22:21.153
tools we have and the understanding we have. What 
we need now is to get more understanding of ocean

22:21.173 --> 22:24.257
processes. For example, what is the size of the 
circulation cells in the ocean?

22:37.118 --> 22:54.033
It looks as if they're relatively small compared 
to, let's say, the Hadley cells in the atmosphere,

22:37.118 --> 22:54.033
that you can deal with most motions in the ocean on a 
scale of a couple hundred miles. These big eddies

22:55.755 --> 23:05.303
in the Gulf Stream and the Kuroshio

22:55.755 --> 23:05.303
are not the size of the planetary eddies in the 
atmosphere. They have a different scale, and we

23:06.346 --> 23:11.195
don't really understand that scale. We need to be 
able to do as Walter Munk is thinking of doing to

23:11.215 --> 23:28.607
make measurements, integrative measurements, 
measurements which tell you what the average

23:11.215 --> 23:28.607
conditions are over, say, a 50-mile square, 50 
miles on the side. And one way to do that is to use

23:29.549 --> 23:41.527
acoustics, underwater acoustics, statistics of 
underwater

23:29.549 --> 23:41.527
acoustics. Always in the past, we've made spot 
measurements in the ocean, either vertical

23:41.547 --> 23:54.005
series or a series of horizontal points, usually a 
lot of vertical series. But the distances between

23:54.085 --> 23:58.932
those vertical series are so large, And the 
intervals in time are so great that the results are

23:59.958 --> 24:09.708
very unsatisfactory. We need to be able to measure 
the state of the ocean all over, over a large piece

24:09.728 --> 24:17.836
of it, within a very short time. You can't do this by 
the standard oceanographic technique of

24:18.897 --> 24:24.702
measuring, of taking oceanographic stations. 
Nor can you do it from a satellite. The satellite

24:27.835 --> 24:31.800
can't see below the surface for a few meters. You 
may be able to do it with a great many buoys, but

24:34.144 --> 24:43.156
that's certainly a hard way to do it. Possibly the 
best way to do it would be with integrating

24:43.176 --> 24:47.722
measurements. You have two buoys which measure 
the sound velocity and the sound scattering and

24:48.523 --> 24:56.374
the sound absorption. and the refraction of rays 
on a continuing basis, which give you an average

24:57.788 --> 25:19.033
condition on the line between the two buoys, in the 
area between the two buoys, or between two ships,

24:57.788 --> 25:19.033
something like that. In other words, we need to be 
able to get more meaningful measurements

25:19.053 --> 25:26.462
with fewer with fewer observing points.

25:31.701 --> 25:51.998
And until we're able to do that, in other words, 
until we're able to develop a new set of tools, a new

25:31.701 --> 25:51.998
set of instruments for exploration, I think we 
might very well

25:31.701 --> 25:51.998
be running out our string on exploration with the 
present tools. And of course, the third reason is

25:58.100 --> 26:03.268
that the people are much more concerned now about 
the resources of the ocean than they used to be.

26:04.289 --> 26:09.176
Looks like we're coming close to the limit of how 
many fish we can catch. We need to understand the

26:09.196 --> 26:24.999
ecology of fishes, and I mean the ecology, not the 
life history or the migrations of single species,

26:09.196 --> 26:24.999
but how fishes live in their environment with 
other organisms much better than we do. We need to

26:26.281 --> 26:27.583
understand the the location and the means of 
recovery, potential reservoirs of oil in the near

26:28.390 --> 26:43.907
shore zone within 200 miles of shore. We probably 
need to know more about the

26:45.809 --> 26:55.579
distribution and content of the manganese 
nodules in the deep sea. We need to know more about

26:58.006 --> 27:16.488
coastal

26:58.006 --> 27:16.488
engineering and about the problems of ports, 
harbors, and navigation as ocean traffic builds

26:58.006 --> 27:16.488
up. The amount of overseas trade is now at a level 
that nobody even imagined 20 years ago. The big

27:28.060 --> 27:37.070
bulk carriers represented by various kinds of 
hazards, they're so hard to maneuver. Need

27:37.410 --> 27:40.974
perhaps a new system for handling those things. 
Much perhaps something like we handle airplanes.

27:44.698 --> 27:48.402
Rigorously control the position at all times.

27:51.646 --> 27:57.072
I would guess that, I'm not necessarily saying I'm 
in favor of this, I would think it's likely that

27:57.946 --> 28:17.575
ocean engineering and applied ocean science

27:57.946 --> 28:17.575
are going to be more prominent and fundamental 
scientific research less prominent over

27:57.946 --> 28:17.575
the next 50 years. I say this myself with some 
unhappiness because I think it's an awful lot of

28:17.595 --> 28:27.109
fun to find out things. Not to use what you find out.

28:36.148 --> 28:42.337
One of the things that we may be doing in the future 
is building large floating installations in the

28:36.148 --> 28:42.337
high and the open ocean. Maybe cities in the sea. 
Maybe nuclear reactors in the sea. That seems very

28:48.446 --> 28:50.849
likely. Maybe big pleasure domes offshore. And 
this may be particularly true in some crowded

28:57.110 --> 29:04.418
parts of the world, like Java, for example. Maybe 
you just have to extend the land area of Java by

29:04.438 --> 29:09.523
putting a lot of it on the ocean. And maybe this 
could even happen in some of the other

29:09.543 --> 29:22.797
megalopolises that are near the seacoast, like 
the Boston or the Portsmouth to Richmond

29:09.543 --> 29:22.797
megalopolis off the east coast. I think it's much 
more likely to happen off Java than it is off the

29:24.093 --> 29:27.799
East Coast. But our population looks like it was 
stabilized. There may be other reasons for

29:31.244 --> 29:35.350
putting installations offshore. That's a big 
engineering, a whole host of engineering

29:35.370 --> 29:45.645
problems involved in doing

29:35.370 --> 29:45.645
that.

29:52.072 --> 30:00.001
Guys like Bill Nirenberg are interested in 
getting energy out of

29:52.072 --> 30:00.001
the ocean. For example, possibly taking 
advantage of the temperature gradient between

30:00.021 --> 30:03.265
the surface and the deep water. Maybe getting wave 
energy,

30:05.808 --> 30:16.240
which is a form of wind energy, but more 
concentrated than wind energy.

30:18.920 --> 30:28.754
you can concentrate the energy from a large area 
and a small area because of the fact that waves lose

30:18.920 --> 30:28.754
very little energy as they propagate across the 
ocean. That may be a useful thing

30:28.774 --> 30:33.541
to look at. Maybe you can use marine organisms like 
kelp and other seaweeds as a source of energy,

30:33.561 --> 30:45.838
turning them into alcohol or methane or something 
like that.
