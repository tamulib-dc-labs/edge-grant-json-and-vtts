WEBVTT

00:09.582 --> 00:22.359
OK. To continue with acoustics in the blind, this 
may or may not be a worthwhile kind of thing to do.

00:22.479 --> 00:24.361
But we have not investigated it very much. And 
unfortunately, it's the kind of thing, while I've

00:25.403 --> 00:38.560
spent a modest amount of time on it and talked to 
some of the people involved with the blind, I'm

00:25.403 --> 00:38.560
afraid I've been somewhat of a cop out in trying to 
carry it to any kind of a conclusion. This is one of

00:39.923 --> 00:54.122
the difficulties one gets when you're in an 
institution as small as Woods Hole that is

00:39.923 --> 00:54.122
isolated so far from a city where a large number of 
things are going on. Our acoustics groups aren't

00:55.023 --> 01:07.399
big enough to really hire anybody for this game, 
and it's a little difficult for me to see how to work

00:55.023 --> 01:07.399
in this very much unless one goes into a a much 
larger city or a place like Boston

01:07.750 --> 01:18.402
where one can work with a much larger group of 
people.

01:29.354 --> 01:35.040
Now, I have just a few more questions to ask you, and 
then that'll take care of the interview. First of

01:36.802 --> 01:37.403
all, What's your impression of the present 
environmentalist movement?

01:49.082 --> 01:49.863
Is this running? It's running. Oh, it is running. 
My first thought with regards to the

01:53.468 --> 02:05.365
environmentalist movement is that the world as a 
whole has been most fortunate that Rachel Carson,

02:06.728 --> 02:19.222
efforts and work in the Silent Spring and so forth 
occurred prior to the so-called energy crisis

02:06.728 --> 02:19.222
initiated by OPEC. I'm afraid if it had been the 
other way around, no one would have paid any

02:19.242 --> 02:28.672
attention to the environmentalists.

02:30.575 --> 02:33.698
Getting more specific, there's probably no 
question but what environmental problems are

02:34.977 --> 02:56.820
very real, that the people who are involved with 
them go all the way from serious, thoughtful

02:34.977 --> 02:56.820
people to the lunatic fringe.

02:56.840 --> 03:00.124
Oceanography has probably been very fortunate in 
having a geophysics earth scientists in general

03:01.252 --> 03:06.321
have tended to be leaders in the environmental 
field. I think oceanography can be very proud of

03:06.741 --> 03:12.151
the work they did do. For example, much of the CO2 
involved

03:12.191 --> 03:22.689
was initiated by oceanographers. And in fact, 
that was, I believe, an important part of the of the

03:29.095 --> 03:39.004
Indian Ocean Expedition, which probably Roger 
may well have talked about some of this much more

03:29.095 --> 03:39.004
knowingly than I have. I am pretty well convinced 
that the ocean is an enormous place. And if we use

03:46.572 --> 03:53.779
common sense, we can do a great deal of 
experimenting in the ocean. And I mean social

03:54.519 --> 03:56.401
experimenting. We're not going to... wreck the 
ocean overnight any more than the Spanish

03:58.728 --> 04:08.919
explorers could wreck the Americas overnight. 
They could play havoc in small areas. But it took

04:11.502 --> 04:17.568
centuries to make any great impression on the 
Americas.

04:23.835 --> 04:26.558
One example of this was I had mentioned earlier in 
the work with Crossroads. I think it was probably a

04:29.983 --> 04:38.951
wonderful thing that the United States and 
oceanographers became involved in those early

04:29.983 --> 04:38.951
nuclear weapons tests. They're not the kinds of 
things I would like to see go on indefinitely, but

04:38.971 --> 04:50.762
so much was learned early in the game that helped 
provide the perspective that is necessary to work

04:38.971 --> 04:50.762
towards the final solution of the problem.

04:54.385 --> 04:56.747
As far as oceanographers are concerned, We, as a 
group, are probably too conservative. We have not

05:05.295 --> 05:08.820
tried to make any more comprehensive. To my way of 
thinking, we have not outlined comprehensive

05:09.781 --> 05:25.384
enough research at a large enough scale to make as 
big bites in the problem as we should.

05:26.410 --> 05:52.719
example, if a serious 10-year program 
encompassing ocean engineering and social

05:26.410 --> 05:52.719
aspects of it as well as the more conventional, 
purely scientific aspects of oceanography and

05:26.410 --> 05:52.719
dumping and so forth were concerned, I think the 
nation would be far better off and science would

05:26.410 --> 05:52.719
profit a great deal. For example, we know There are 
many good conjectures and so forth. We know very

05:58.940 --> 06:10.152
little about the feasibility of putting waste 
into very deep holes. We know very little about how

06:10.872 --> 06:17.259
long, about the fate of waste in deep holes.

06:20.282 --> 06:21.223
There has been Almost no work in dumping sewage, 
for example, under the thermocline, where it gets

06:22.334 --> 06:36.193
out of the surface areas for certainly decades. 
There are clearly pros and cons to this. But

06:40.078 --> 06:49.911
in a situation such as Hawaii, where they have such 
an enormous amount of ocean around them, that the

06:50.836 --> 06:54.281
beach is sloped so much. It would seem this is a kind 
of an oceanographic experiment, a large scale

06:54.301 --> 07:01.431
oceanographic experiment that should be done. 
And then if it turns out to work out well, it could be

07:02.132 --> 07:06.077
emulated other places. If it doesn't work out 
well, it could. But these are some of the kinds of

07:09.121 --> 07:14.128
things that I really believe we're wasting time. 
Somehow or other, our leadership in the higher

07:15.210 --> 07:20.657
level Washington community many of whom are 
composed of individuals within our own

07:21.633 --> 07:32.486
profession, I think are really rather sadly 
lacking in gumption and foresight. I believe this

07:33.807 --> 07:43.759
is one of the problems with financing in 
oceanography, that in recent years

07:33.807 --> 07:43.759
oceanographers have not been posing attacks on 
some of these problems on the scale where we might

07:44.768 --> 07:53.278
really learn something significant enough to 
alter the way society goes. I believe the American

07:54.719 --> 08:01.667
public and Congress and so forth somehow or other 
directly or indirectly recognizes this. And they

08:02.468 --> 08:14.522
don't want to have much to do with intermediary 
size experiments that don't stand a very much

08:02.468 --> 08:14.522
chance to come out with a very good clear yes or a 
very clear no.

08:17.033 --> 08:21.640
If you had to name one accomplishment in your 
career as oceanographer, what would you name?

08:26.307 --> 08:37.084
First, I would say, as we discussed last night, 
that that is not so much a difficult question as an

08:26.307 --> 08:37.084
indeterminate question.

08:41.333 --> 08:51.183
I believe because there are completely different 
kinds of accomplishments which don't come under

08:41.333 --> 08:51.183
the same category.

08:55.046 --> 09:07.999
In the sort of classical oceanographic public 
sense, I suppose my principal interest has tended

08:55.046 --> 09:07.999
to be to make the undersea and the bottom of the 
ocean part of the real world. And take it a little

09:18.923 --> 09:38.560
bit more out of the mythical, excuse me, not take it 
out of the mythical class, but to the mythical and

09:18.923 --> 09:38.560
social aspects of the literary aspects of the 
ocean to be able to incorporate it more in the

09:18.923 --> 09:38.560
analytical scientific category. After all, the 
ocean is only three miles deep, and our reasons for

09:38.827 --> 09:49.322
not being better acquainted with it are primarily 
social rather than technical.

09:50.544 --> 10:04.885
Anything of more lasting value, perhaps, I feel 
anything that can be done to make the world more

09:50.544 --> 10:04.885
stable is probably one of the most important 
things that can happen, and I feel that my If any

10:06.383 --> 10:27.275
major contribution was probably part of the being 
involved in some useful way in the major

10:06.383 --> 10:27.275
revolution that went on in undersea warfare and 
underwater acoustics.

10:29.358 --> 10:33.825
So I guess those are the two aspects I would 
mention. You can cheat by mentioning two rather

10:34.042 --> 10:36.225
than one. All right. Is there anything you'd like 
to add to the tape?

10:43.273 --> 10:51.222
I

10:43.273 --> 10:51.222
would like to discuss that with you just a little 
bit more. One of the things is perhaps take

10:52.003 --> 11:00.133
advantage of your view of this thing and block out, 
just mention a few of the principal kinds of events

11:00.282 --> 11:16.017
that have happened that I have felt have been 
significant to the field of oceanography.

11:18.759 --> 11:23.524
Then look at the piece of paper in front of me under 
sort of different categories.

11:25.886 --> 11:26.847
We don't need to of what the Challenger expedition 
of a century ago was important, as well as many

11:29.628 --> 11:36.822
since.

11:41.230 --> 11:47.081
What happened to the importance of the National 
Academy of Sciences in getting things going in

11:41.230 --> 11:47.081
oceanography? It has been spasmodic, but it has 
been extremely important from the first

11:47.702 --> 11:51.990
committee in the 20s. The second committees in the 
40s was not particularly effective. But the

12:01.380 --> 12:12.812
report they put out in the latter part of the 50s, 
which was Oceanography 1960 to 1970, I think was a

12:01.380 --> 12:12.812
landmark kind of report. Pulled oceanographers 
together and pulled the nation together in

12:13.553 --> 12:20.661
oceanography in an outstanding way.

12:24.708 --> 12:29.375
One of the reasons it was so successful, of course, 
was that Sputnik was the press agent. And that was

12:30.676 --> 12:32.699
an enormous help. It opened up people's eyes. It 
opened up people's coffers.

12:43.234 --> 12:48.702
I've mentioned from time to time of the tremendous 
importance of equipment. In my own case, I've

12:50.424 --> 12:53.989
tended to concentrate quite a bit on the 
equipment, not from the standpoint of bolts and

12:54.290 --> 13:13.488
nuts, but from the standpoint that I believe 
progress in our field is a subtle combination of

12:54.290 --> 13:13.488
new ideas, new data, and new technology. And our 
social system seems to be put together so that the

13:20.902 --> 13:28.312
particularly in recent times, that new 
techniques, people think of that as engineering

13:20.902 --> 13:28.312
and not science. This, I think, is an unfortunate 
decade or two of oceanography, which I hope we will

13:28.933 --> 13:48.681
get over and get back to being more 
problem-oriented and do whatever is necessary to

13:28.933 --> 13:48.681
learn more about Mother Earth and use her for 
better.

13:51.192 --> 14:04.268
Trends to get global ships so that we could operate 
over the surface of the Earth pretty much where we

13:51.192 --> 14:04.268
wanted to is so terribly important. I note that 
this morning's newspaper describes the first

14:04.288 --> 14:14.020
visit of a surface ship to the North Pole. Three 
cheers for the Russians and the crew of the Arctic

14:16.343 --> 14:20.828
for their work. and I hope this is what should be the 
first of more routine usage of the Arctic Ocean,

14:21.314 --> 14:43.185
which after all is one of our oceans, and to date has 
been much more an ocean of the poet than of the

14:21.314 --> 14:43.185
oceanographer.

14:43.205 --> 14:46.630
The general trends towards higher resolution 
equipment which, in a simpler fashion, is merely

14:47.588 --> 14:58.484
getting ourselves new glasses so that we can see 
more of what the ocean is like, should continue on

14:47.588 --> 14:58.484
indefinitely.

15:02.950 --> 15:12.985
Stop.

15:13.005 --> 15:13.806
Any more questions? Nope. What kinds of 
questions?

15:21.642 --> 15:23.047
people and marine policy.
