00:02.326 --> 00:06.388
Wednesday the 27th. Wednesday the 27th. 
Wednesday the 27th.

00:13.430 --> 00:30.065
Today, chatting still with Dr. Dean Gage, and 
today we have him ready to begin service again as a

00:13.430 --> 00:30.065
faculty member at Texas A&M. You returned from the 
University of Tennessee what year? I returned in

00:33.268 --> 00:37.292
August of 1982. And joined the Department of? 
Well, actually, I became associate dean for

00:40.700 --> 00:45.572
academic and clinical programs. That's right. 
And I did have a tenured faculty position in the

00:47.737 --> 00:52.549
Department of Small Animal Medicine and Surgery. 
My responsibilities were totally

00:53.272 --> 00:57.157
administrative. And describe, as you understood 
them when you arrived, describe what your

00:57.177 --> 01:03.746
responsibilities were to be. Well, I assure you 
they became somewhat different than when I

01:04.047 --> 01:14.641
arrived because so many different things needed a 
lot of change and upgrading put into it. And the

01:14.661 --> 01:21.050
title really signified a few major areas of 
responsibility. One was for the entire

01:22.516 --> 01:30.727
Veterinary Medical Teaching Hospital, and the 
second was all of the academic programs within the

01:22.516 --> 01:30.727
College of Veterinary Medicine. And there were 
some real opportunities and real challenges, one

01:31.829 --> 01:41.402
of which was to completely reorganize the 
Veterinary Teaching Hospital put it into the

01:41.686 --> 02:10.461
context of truly being a veterinary medical 
teaching hospital with all of the departments

01:41.686 --> 02:10.461
both clinical and basic science participating 
and to structure a hospital board that would

01:41.686 --> 02:10.461
reflect the different services and academic and 
research programs that would need to be a part of

01:41.686 --> 02:10.461
that kind of operation. The second major 
responsibility was clearly in the academic arena

02:11.285 --> 02:24.042
of all of the student affairs, the academic 
program, the curriculum. And at that point in

02:24.783 --> 02:35.217
time, we were in the process of coming up with a 
brand new curriculum and totally shelving the old

02:24.783 --> 02:35.217
curriculum coming with a new one with a new 
schedule, of getting some of the departments to

02:35.855 --> 02:49.049
give up hours, which is never easy, and the 
students were already taking no less than 19 and up

02:35.855 --> 02:49.049
to 21 hours a semester. So it was a terrifically 
heavy load for them anyway. So those were the two

02:53.774 --> 02:57.998
big areas of responsibility and the two big areas 
of challenge. How did that new curriculum, how did

02:58.418 --> 03:01.862
it come about? Well, that was interesting because 
clearly I knew that in the dean's role that I had to

03:02.129 --> 03:12.278
take a lead and that it was going to take some tough, 
hard decision making to bring people to an

03:02.129 --> 03:12.278
agreement. I knew that no one or not everyone would 
be happy. There's no way to ever do that. And no one

03:18.183 --> 03:19.965
ever wants to give up hours. They simply want to 
pack more material into it. So I laid down the

03:23.328 --> 03:30.634
guidelines and I went to Dean Shelton and I told 
him, I said, you've got to give me the authority and

03:31.205 --> 03:36.190
really the leverage to be able to force some 
decisions. And I'm going to get these people in a

03:37.252 --> 03:39.114
room. We're going to set the guidelines, the 
rules, and start from a clean slate and build it

03:39.174 --> 03:45.480
from the bottom up. And I told him it would take a lot 
of long, hard hours and long, long meetings. And I

03:51.307 --> 03:56.252
purposely began to meet in the evening on a few of 
them. So about 1130 at night, you begin to get a lot

03:56.292 --> 04:00.857
more consensus and agreement. And when we 
finished, there was a real sense of

04:01.192 --> 04:09.924
accomplishment, an ownership, an excitement 
about having something new. We were fortunate in

04:10.805 --> 04:15.111
that we had seen a lot of the new curriculums around 
the country. I came from the University of

04:15.932 --> 04:20.178
Tennessee where we put a brand new curriculum in 
from scratch. And quite frankly, I used that

04:20.839 --> 04:26.406
experience of starting from ground zero, 
throwing the old out. We didn't have an old there,

04:26.466 --> 04:30.051
but throwing the old out here and starting from 
scratch. And it was an exciting time for us,

04:30.723 --> 04:33.507
really. As you look back now, who deserves credit 
for being very positive in helping bring those

04:33.807 --> 04:41.918
changes about? Well, I think clearly Dean Shelton 
had a role in it because he had communicated to all

04:42.679 --> 04:52.832
the department heads that we had to do that. And 
they had to be a part of it. They had to support the

04:54.498 --> 05:01.745
entire college over an individual interest. We 
have great cooperation among the department

05:01.905 --> 05:05.688
heads, too. And I went to them in the dean's 
meetings and told them that I had to have their help

05:06.649 --> 05:13.475
and they had to be a part of it. So it was a joint 
effort, a real team effort that met with, I think,

05:22.867 --> 05:52.080
excitement because it was at a time where 
curricula around the nation were also changing

05:22.867 --> 05:52.080
and our leadership knew that we wanted to be at the 
forefront to do some things new and that we were

05:22.867 --> 05:52.080
already one of the leading veterinary medical 
colleges so this gave us an opportunity to even

05:22.867 --> 05:52.080
press forward in a higher visible role were there 
any other schools that had already made these

05:53.377 --> 05:55.039
changes? Many of the schools were either in the 
process of making changes or what really was

05:56.000 --> 06:10.575
before us was that there were seven new schools 
that came aboard within the last four or five years

05:56.000 --> 06:10.575
preceding that time. So those schools came with no 
old curriculum. They got to put a lot of new things

06:13.818 --> 06:15.480
in. So that gave a real impetus for probably most 
every veterinary medical college in the nation to

06:15.560 --> 06:23.248
redo their curriculum. In terms of what was 
dropped out, eliminated, or left behind, and what

06:23.633 --> 06:33.104
was introduced, what were the major changes? The 
major changes, quite honestly, reflected where

06:33.124 --> 06:52.307
the profession was for that day and for really 
where it is now in the fact that the knowledge base,

06:33.124 --> 06:52.307
the expertise had both become so expanded over the 
last 25, 30 years to the point that specialization

06:53.317 --> 06:58.122
was a real part of the profession. And by that, I 
mean all the board certifications, you know,

06:58.763 --> 07:04.850
ophthalmology, radiology, surgery. And I came 
from surgical specialty of being a diplomate of

07:04.870 --> 07:11.957
the American College of Veterinary Surgeons. And 
others would go into a more narrow field such as

07:12.898 --> 07:20.927
biomedical research or one of the basic science 
areas. So that it became very evident to us that we

07:21.532 --> 07:35.804
had to allow for some specialization within the 
curriculum itself to meet the needs and the

07:21.532 --> 07:35.804
demands of the profession and the public that was 
using the veterinary medical services. Now, did

07:36.725 --> 07:51.437
this also reflect a shift in numbers of patients 
from large animal to small animal, from rural to

07:36.725 --> 07:51.437
urban? It did to some degree mainly because there 
was a higher percentage and had been for several

07:51.839 --> 08:05.159
years of students that would go into a small animal 
practice versus the opportunities in large

07:51.839 --> 08:05.159
animal. But what it did, it also allowed us to take 
the large animal tracks and to specialize more in

08:05.820 --> 08:20.462
equine or food animal or mixed practice and then 
move over into the small animal where they could

08:05.820 --> 08:20.462
spend additional hours in any of those areas that 
they might elect or where they had a career

08:20.982 --> 08:24.026
interest. So, yeah, very much that was reflected 
in what we did. Give some examples, as you can

08:29.152 --> 08:35.980
recall it, of how you felt it was working, those 
changes. Well, the changes were confirmed by the

08:37.402 --> 08:45.952
way the students began to register for some of the 
specialty tracks.

08:48.696 --> 08:49.757
The overall acceptance of the faculty and how that 
was accepted was something that we put in place

08:51.155 --> 09:19.744
from the beginning and that is that at the end of 
every semester I would have an evaluation of that

08:51.155 --> 09:19.744
semester at the end of every year that was 
completed for those students we'd have an

08:51.155 --> 09:19.744
evaluation among our students among our faculty 
separately of how we felt it was going and we had

08:51.155 --> 09:19.744
made a pact or an agreement in advance that if we 
found that we had problems that we would go back and

09:20.399 --> 09:28.032
make adjustments. And I promised the faculty that 
and the department heads on the front end. We also

09:33.021 --> 09:40.855
did one other thing that I have always felt was a 
very positive step and that is that we would look at

09:41.510 --> 09:42.832
state board results. We would look at doing a 
survey one year, two years post-graduate to see if

09:42.852 --> 09:57.451
the students themselves saw an area of deficit or 
they had an area where they felt like they weren't

09:42.852 --> 09:57.451
prepared as they needed to be. So we tried to put a 
feedback and accountability system in place and I

09:58.213 --> 10:08.226
told the faculty that new curriculum would not be 
in concrete. It would still be in process and still

10:11.326 --> 10:19.496
be mixing until we determined that we were 
accomplishing what we set out to do. Can you give

10:20.537 --> 10:34.213
some examples of events, incidents, comments 
that demonstrated the differing opinions of

10:20.537 --> 10:34.213
people who liked the changes and those who didn't? 
Well, most of the comments that we might get of

10:35.678 --> 10:52.175
people who didn't like the changes versus those 
who did came from those who probably had to give up

10:35.678 --> 10:52.175
hours and they were not getting to maybe share some 
of their personal interest as much as they would

10:35.678 --> 10:52.175
like. A faculty member? Faculty members. We had no 
real

10:53.877 --> 11:03.947
problem with any of the student feedback because I 
think they felt generally that they were well

11:04.214 --> 11:05.936
prepared. One of the areas that has always been a 
criticism of most medical colleges has been that

11:07.318 --> 11:22.760
students did not know the public, the business 
side of it. So we put an internship in, a short-term

11:22.780 --> 11:34.035
internship in, so that they would have actual 
experience on site out in the profession. They get

11:34.842 --> 11:39.147
a lot of that in a veterinary teaching hospital for 
a full year. That's not just a two semester, that is

11:39.187 --> 11:44.333
a full year of training. And it is different though 
in a private practice or another type of specialty

11:44.353 --> 11:57.148
practice than what is at a teaching hospital such 
as the one at Texas A&M. So we tried to bring that

11:57.168 --> 11:58.710
into it. So we tried to correct all those things and 
the students accepted it readily. Now, at this

12:02.483 --> 12:12.876
point, to get into the College of Veterinary 
Medicine as a student, the old two-year pre-vet

12:02.483 --> 12:12.876
program had become four. That was history. That 
had become four. Every student that wanted to get

12:16.181 --> 12:29.858
into the College of Veterinary Medicine entered 
most often having already completed at least a

12:16.181 --> 12:29.858
baccalaureate and many times even a master's 
degree. Now some of the real bright students might

12:30.428 --> 12:41.023
be in their fourth year of their baccalaureate 
degree and they would gain admission provided

12:30.428 --> 12:41.023
they finish the baccalaureate degree. And then 
the old trimester program had become four years.

12:47.793 --> 12:48.814
Had become four years. We had moved from the three 
year, three trimester year to the four-year

12:53.429 --> 12:55.973
curriculum. As you look back now on those two 
changes, what were the pluses and if any minuses?

13:03.406 --> 13:09.095
Well, the biggest plus was the removal of so much 
year-round burnout. I always told students that

13:10.097 --> 13:16.568
it is not as much the complexity of the content as it 
is the overwhelming pace and volume. And when you

13:23.353 --> 13:31.683
go year round with very short breaks between a 
term, that is a tough, tough time. The other thing

13:32.464 --> 13:44.378
that I saw was that it was probably easier on the 
faculty too because they had a summer to devote

13:32.464 --> 13:44.378
them to their other research activities and to go 
back and refresh and to redo a lot of curriculum

13:44.999 --> 13:47.844
material. When you're working year round with no 
breaks, the time factor for student and faculty

13:47.864 --> 13:57.220
really became an issue. Compare the student body 
of the College of Veterinary Medicine at that

13:58.122 --> 14:06.616
point with the student body when you were a member 
of it. Well, that's an interesting comparison.

14:10.615 --> 14:16.323
Because as stated earlier, the first girl that 
ever went to veterinary college was in my class. So

14:16.343 --> 14:18.426
there was one girl and 63 men. And when I left the 
veterinary college in 1989, the student body was

14:19.708 --> 14:32.946
about 50, 55% women and 45, 50% men. So that was a 
dramatic change. The other major change I saw was

14:41.142 --> 14:54.916
related to the work ethic and the difference in 
having the kind of study skills that I saw back

14:41.142 --> 14:54.916
earlier. And that simply is reflective of the 
society, the affluence, where so many young men

14:55.517 --> 15:08.550
and women never had to work manually even, as hard 
as they did back in the earlier times. So most of the

15:12.574 --> 15:32.244
time when a student had trouble, it was because of 
the fact that they never had to work that hard, it

15:12.574 --> 15:32.244
was new to them, or they had not yet developed the 
kind of hard-working study skills that were

15:12.574 --> 15:32.244
absolutely required to just keep up with the pace, 
the volume of material that was going to be

15:12.574 --> 15:32.244
covered. Were the students also different in 
their geographic and economic backgrounds?

15:37.741 --> 15:50.532
Probably we had more from the urban areas starting 
in the probably even late 70s, mid to late 70s, and I

15:37.741 --> 15:50.532
think that trend is still there. But there was 
still a great representation geographically

15:51.133 --> 15:58.519
from the entire state and a lot of rural areas too. 
Describe the admissions process at that time. The

16:04.024 --> 16:07.107
admissions process had not changed to a high 
degree. with the exception that an aptitude test

16:07.812 --> 16:12.859
had been put in place. So the students' actual 
performance, their overall GPA, their GPA in the

16:12.879 --> 16:33.948
sciences, their GPA in the last 45 semester credit 
hours were all taken into account as a very

16:12.879 --> 16:33.948
important predictor of whether or not they could 
handle the professional curriculum. The

16:34.889 --> 16:37.212
aptitude test was also very important. because a 
student that might not have applied themselves

16:37.681 --> 16:47.476
early but yet had tremendous intellect, that 
would help give them a little boost because we knew

16:37.681 --> 16:47.476
they could handle it. But their own record was 
critically important. At that time though, every

16:53.004 --> 17:05.342
student had to have an interview because it was 
very important that the selection admissions

16:53.004 --> 17:05.342
committee knew that that student had a 
motivation, they had checked out what the

16:53.004 --> 17:05.342
profession was, they knew what they were going to 
get into, and they could demonstrate that they had

17:05.592 --> 17:17.330
the personal skills to really be a professional. 
And there were people probably with

17:17.350 --> 17:32.933
significantly high grades that may not have got in 
because their personality profile, just their

17:17.350 --> 17:32.933
characteristics did not fit what was going to be 
required of them. Do you remember in general what

17:33.453 --> 17:35.957
kind of a GPA? The average GPA from top to bottom was 
always around a 3.4 and that means we had some with a

17:37.219 --> 17:47.315
4.0 and a few down into the 3.2, 3.1. The reason that 
it was a spread like that was the fact that some of

17:49.619 --> 18:01.097
the students who had gotten off to a bad start but 
yet had done very well in the last 45 semester

18:01.685 --> 18:18.657
credit hours, which was singled out in the higher 
level courses, would be given a little bit of a

18:01.685 --> 18:18.657
favorable

18:01.685 --> 18:18.657
evaluation because they were handling those 
harder courses at a better level. They didn't come

18:18.877 --> 18:21.402
in high and go low. They came in and then kept 
increasing in their GPA. Can you share any

18:25.445 --> 18:34.034
examples of attempted outside interference to 
gain admission? We had letters from every kind of

18:34.475 --> 18:53.595
political office that probably would be in the 
state and even national to give favorable

18:34.475 --> 18:53.595
treatment to certain students, but those were 
given no more weight. than any letters of

18:54.183 --> 18:59.009
reference that the students were asked to have 
submitted on their behalf. The students'

19:00.351 --> 19:09.323
academic performance and background and their 
own personal record constituted what the main

19:00.351 --> 19:09.323
selection was based on. This is an editorial note 
to the typist. One time in the early 70s, probably

19:18.500 --> 19:40.947
74, maybe 75, as dean of faculties, I was in 
President Williams' office, phone rang, and it

19:18.500 --> 19:40.947
was Oscar Wyatt, prominent Houstonian, calling 
in regard to the admission of a young man I believe

19:18.500 --> 19:40.947
was related to his secretary. And as I recall, he 
apparently had promised her that he would see to it

19:42.766 --> 19:49.099
that this young man was admitted. And this had not 
happened. Mr. Wyatt was calling Dr. Williams to

19:52.706 --> 19:56.674
tell him to take care of it. Dr. Williams had the 
material on his desk because he'd been expecting a

19:58.628 --> 20:08.420
call, and the student's record wasn't even 
marginal. It was pitifully

20:08.581 --> 20:15.029
poor. And he told Mr. Wyatt that he could not, in 
fairness to everyone else, set someone else aside

20:15.189 --> 20:26.323
and put that person in there. I remember Mr. Wyatt 
getting louder and stronger in his voice. And then

20:32.147 --> 20:34.255
he started cussing Dr. Williams. and he ended up by 
saying i'm going to get you fired and then he used

20:35.264 --> 21:04.292
some real strong three and four letter word 
language and dr williams at first was frowning and

20:35.264 --> 21:04.292
then he started smiling as he hung up the phone 
uh... that for me was an example of some of the

20:35.264 --> 21:04.292
problems that administrators have to face when 
there are selective processes for admission

21:07.529 --> 21:25.632
In comparing those years with your earlier years, 
how much more difficult was it for an applicant for

21:07.529 --> 21:25.632
admission to the College of Veterinary Medicine 
in your administrative years? Actually, the

21:25.652 --> 21:37.266
admission was probably no more difficult because 
we were now taking 128 students and still had

21:25.652 --> 21:37.266
anywhere from four to 550 sometimes 600 
applicants. To contrast that, when I got in, 64

21:40.684 --> 21:46.017
students and over 600 applicants. And that really 
is what precipitated the increase in the

21:52.957 --> 21:59.748
professional school enrollment, that the need 
was there and there were so many young men and women

21:52.957 --> 21:59.748
in Texas that wanted to go to veterinary college. 
Do you have any recollection as to what year that

21:59.768 --> 22:07.020
jump in the admission number occurred? It 
occurred probably in the early 60s. Early 60s. We

22:12.413 --> 22:17.698
had 600 that year. But no, I'm talking about the 
number to be admitted. Yes, because my class was

22:22.523 --> 22:25.426
the last class of 64. The following year they went 
to 97 and then they went to 128. At one time they had

22:31.892 --> 22:42.403
gotten up to 138 and then dropped it back and it 
stabilized at 128 for I presume now at least the

22:31.892 --> 22:42.403
last 20 years. And during the years that you were 
close to the admissions process, about what

22:42.653 --> 22:52.769
percentage of the students admitted to Vet 
Medicine had been undergraduates at A&M?

22:54.792 --> 23:00.161
Probably at least 50% of them had done at least part 
of their work here. A good many had done all of it,

23:01.423 --> 23:08.374
but most of them knew that ultimately, since this 
was the only veterinary college in the state of

23:01.423 --> 23:08.374
Texas, They wanted to get here. What other schools 
were important sources for applicants? That was

23:16.068 --> 23:18.693
pretty well distributed throughout the state. 
You'd be surprised at the number from the

23:19.754 --> 23:30.572
University of Texas, Texas Tech, San Houston 
State, Southwest Texas, and San Marcos. We had a

23:32.234 --> 23:33.957
number from Rice. And it was pretty well 
distributed across the state. Were we still in the

23:39.060 --> 23:41.405
contract with? No, we had no contract with any 
other. And we at that time only took 128 Texas

23:44.411 --> 23:48.159
residents. Whereas now, I believe that the 
Veterinary College is taking 10 at large students

23:53.900 --> 24:10.560
from anywhere in the U.S. Am I correct in recalling 
that on occasion students from other states would

23:53.900 --> 24:10.560
move here, not go to college for a year, become a 
legal resident, and then apply? That's exactly

24:10.580 --> 24:11.641
right. In fact, the residency issue became very 
real in that they could not come to the state of

24:11.681 --> 24:21.493
Texas, be a student, and work part-time and become 
a Texas resident. And it was clear to us when we'd

24:22.081 --> 24:40.706
look at the backgrounds of some of the students 
that they moved to the state and maybe worked a year

24:22.081 --> 24:40.706
or two, not enrolled in any college work at all in 
order to establish residency, then continue to

24:22.081 --> 24:40.706
take coursework and apply as a Texas resident. And 
the reason for that was that this was such a great

24:40.906 --> 24:49.978
veterinary college, but also that tuition was so 
much less than most all of the other states. That is

24:50.262 --> 24:57.413
no longer and was no longer the case about the time I 
left the College of Veterinary Medicine. The

24:57.433 --> 25:01.360
tuition had begun to go up substantially. Right, 
now you're in this role as Associate Dean for how

25:02.041 --> 25:04.825
long? I was in that role from 1982 through 1988. And 
how did your task change? Before I tell you how that

25:18.055 --> 25:29.170
changed, I would like to tell you there were a 
couple of things that we did other than just the

25:18.055 --> 25:29.170
academics that I thought were very important to 
the future of the college. One was that I went in to

25:30.753 --> 25:43.410
Dean Shelton and I told him, I said, George, this is 
not a formula kind of program. Long term for the

25:43.430 --> 25:47.556
health and the advancement of this College of 
Inherent Medicine. We have to look at what we can do

25:51.632 --> 26:03.890
to get the funding to change that item similar to 
what is being done for the medical and dental

25:51.632 --> 26:03.890
schools in the state. He said, I agree with you. 
I've had discussions with the higher

26:06.414 --> 26:09.999
administration. We've had so much turnover there 
that about the time I get someone up to speed on it,

26:10.060 --> 26:15.788
they have gone. And he said, will you help me and 
let's go. And I said, well, let's go. Let's put it

26:19.600 --> 26:20.582
together. Let's put the package together. Let's 
go to the university administration, show them

26:23.807 --> 26:35.346
the benefit that it would have to them by taking us 
and putting us a line item separately funded like

26:23.807 --> 26:35.346
the medical and dental schools. And I said, one 
other thing that I think is very important that we

26:36.107 --> 26:42.417
do, and that is that we designate this entire 
complex as the Texas Veterinary Medical Center to

26:43.578 --> 26:55.936
give it the same public awareness as the Texas 
Medical Center in Houston, for instance. Because

26:56.497 --> 26:59.281
I told him, I said, we're the only one in the state. 
In all the complicated cases, they all come here.

27:04.067 --> 27:05.209
And we are that. So let's project our true identity 
so that we can get our funding on base, which will

27:06.010 --> 27:11.458
allow us to develop our research programs and it 
will allow us to develop all the clinical

27:12.029 --> 27:21.842
specialties that we're going to need if we're 
going to be in a top five veterinary college. So

27:22.663 --> 27:38.644
right after I had finished all of that, I had been 
offered the deanship at two other universities,

27:22.663 --> 27:38.644
but my heart was here at A&M and I wanted to see that 
veterinary college become the very best And I had

27:39.113 --> 27:44.320
been interviewed for a couple of upper 
administrative positions at A&M. I had even been

27:45.681 --> 27:54.793
recommended by a selection committee and was not 
picked by the upper level administrator at the

27:45.681 --> 27:54.793
time. But Bill Mobley was executive

27:56.015 --> 28:08.631
vice chancellor right under Perry Atkinson and 
was named president of Texas A&M. And I wrote Bill a

28:09.725 --> 28:17.756
letter indicating to him my background, my 
administrative background, and my interest. And

28:19.018 --> 28:34.398
just sent my resume to him and said that if you have a 
position in your office or your administration

28:19.018 --> 28:34.398
where I could be a fit and make a difference, please 
keep me in mind. And this was when he was first

28:34.499 --> 28:37.082
putting together his team. And a few weeks went by 
and I get a call from him. And I really did not know

28:42.724 --> 28:47.469
him except to see him. And I go over and talk to him 
and he gives me some idea about a position that

28:47.489 --> 28:59.463
would be chief of staff and executive assistant to 
the president. And it would also involve handling

28:59.483 --> 29:02.287
state affairs. Well, I had had a long-term 
interest in politics and legislative issues and

29:04.788 --> 29:21.851
had gone through the process of dealing with a 
couple of legislative sessions when we moved the

29:04.788 --> 29:21.851
veterinary college to a line item in the Texas 
Veterinary Medical Center. So he then got back to

29:21.871 --> 29:33.968
me shortly afterwards, and on January 1, 1989, I 
moved to the president's office. to become chief

29:34.623 --> 29:52.116
of staff and executive assistant to the president 
and handling just the chief of staff

29:34.623 --> 29:52.116
responsibilities in that office and a lot of the 
external liaison to the different constituents

29:34.623 --> 29:52.116
as well as state affairs. Compare what you 
understood to be your assignment to what it turned

29:57.944 --> 29:59.686
out to be. Well, it was like most other 
responsibilities and jobs that I have had. You

30:04.771 --> 30:16.642
take it with a written job description, but 
there's always one last job responsibility

30:04.771 --> 30:16.642
written on there which says, and all other 
assigned responsibilities. And that became a

30:16.823 --> 30:24.390
huge expanded part of that position because he was 
a visionary. and had so many programs that he

30:24.961 --> 30:32.109
wanted to put into the university to implement. 
And I usually got the assignment of doing, I guess,

30:32.749 --> 30:54.613
kind of the strategic planning of meeting with 
people across campus, of pulling those programs

30:32.749 --> 30:54.613
together, of putting them into a sellable kind of 
proposal that would be a part of the whole

30:32.749 --> 30:54.613
university family. and they could see the benefit 
in moving us toward where we wanted to go. Our heart

30:58.519 --> 31:03.890
and our goal was for A&M to be a top 10 university, 
period. And we were trying to visualize what it

31:03.911 --> 31:09.683
would take for us to become
