WEBVTT

00:01.550 --> 00:30.072
Well, I had started graduate work at Princeton in 
1941, and the major professor was Professor

00:01.550 --> 00:30.072
Wigner, W-I-G-N-R. And after

00:01.550 --> 00:30.072
Pearl Harbor, of course, there was a lot of 
additional work in this field, and they decided to

00:01.550 --> 00:30.072
concentrate the theoretical and experimental 
work on nuclear piles at the University of

00:30.845 --> 00:35.691
Chicago. So, physics professors from several 
universities around the country went there. Two

00:42.479 --> 00:50.809
of them from Princeton went, Professor Wheeler 
and Professor Wigner that I was working with. And

00:50.829 --> 00:53.612
he took me along with him at that time. Before you 
went, did you know what type of research was going

00:54.942 --> 01:01.351
on there and what its ultimate goal was at that 
time? Well, it depends what you mean by the

01:03.174 --> 01:06.259
ultimate goal. We had worked on this some back at 
Princeton and we thought that it was the primary

01:07.661 --> 01:21.321
purpose was to make nuclear power plants and also 
to as a byproduct, make some of the fissionable

01:21.571 --> 01:32.446
materials, which might have some other 
applications, which was rather, well, it wasn't

01:21.571 --> 01:32.446
dwelt upon what it might be. And it wasn't actually 
until, oh, I suppose 1944 or 45, early 45, that many

01:32.486 --> 01:45.224
of us realized that it had anything to do with the 
bomb. Is that right? Yeah. So you thought you were

01:47.588 --> 01:49.350
still... working primarily toward power rather 
than a weapons use. Right. It's amazing, but

01:55.523 --> 01:57.686
that's true. Okay. What exactly was your role 
there at the University of Chicago as related to

02:00.050 --> 02:05.678
the first reactor? Well, I was the assistant to 
Professor Bigner, and we did a lot of the early

02:07.020 --> 02:19.017
calculations about how reactors work and what 
happens to the neutrons after they come out of the

02:19.722 --> 02:35.287
atom that undergoes fission, how they are slowed 
down by the carbon, all of these piles at that time

02:19.722 --> 02:35.287
were made of carbon with cylinders of uranium in 
them. Okay. We set the scene prior to 2nd of

02:36.789 --> 02:44.582
December 1942 and include the problems of getting 
enough fissionable material whether to use

02:45.237 --> 02:52.684
graphite or heavy water to slow down the neutrons 
or any other major problems that were going on at

02:45.237 --> 02:52.684
the time? Well, there were many.

03:03.415 --> 03:07.139
Well, just about anything you mentioned there. In 
the first place, they decided to try to do it with

03:07.159 --> 03:12.544
natural uranium. because there just wasn't 
enough enriched uranium at that time. So that

03:19.386 --> 03:34.148
meant that you had to have the uranium in 
cylinders, and you had to have something around

03:19.386 --> 03:34.148
the uranium that slowed down the neutrons to 
thermal energy sufficiently. And as you say,

03:34.168 --> 03:39.375
probably the two main candidates were carbon and 
heavy water. I think, again, it was just a question

03:41.098 --> 03:43.341
that there wasn't that much heavy water available 
at that time. There were very small quantities,

03:48.427 --> 03:52.231
but you need a lot for a reactor. Yeah, I read in The 
New World by Hewlett and Anderson that they only

03:52.631 --> 04:07.485
had a small quantity in Canada, in a plant in 
Canada, even though it was a much preferred

03:52.631 --> 04:07.485
material over carbon. But they just couldn't 
manufacture enough at the time of the experiment.

04:13.443 --> 04:16.707
And the carbon reactor was very easy to build. Its 
only disadvantage was it had to be considerably

04:16.747 --> 04:21.131
larger than the heavy water one. Why is that, that 
it has to be larger? Well, just because it doesn't

04:24.996 --> 04:37.289
slow down the neutrons as efficiently, and it has 
somewhat higher absorption of the neutrons than

04:24.996 --> 04:37.289
the carbon.

04:38.430 --> 04:42.555
The smaller a reactor is, of course, the more loss 
of neutrons you have, out of the sides relative to

04:43.143 --> 04:48.712
the number you're making. So if you have a more 
inefficient moderator, you've got to have a

04:48.732 --> 04:55.823
larger reactor. OK. The material then, did you all 
end up using uranium-235, or did you use natural

04:56.364 --> 05:03.214
uranium-238? No, it was just natural uranium. So 
it involved a lot of uranium then. A lot of uranium

05:07.461 --> 05:10.045
and a lot of carbon. And they were doing this under 
very strict security there. It was all done under

05:16.452 --> 05:28.308
the old stadium at the University of Chicago, 
which when I first went there had been squash

05:16.452 --> 05:28.308
courts, a game they like to play in the Northeast, 
but not in Texas, I guess. Like racquetball down

05:28.769 --> 05:30.131
here. It's very similar, I think. The ball doesn't 
bounce in squash. I've played it several times.

05:37.430 --> 05:42.156
The first time I got the ball, I was going to play, 
and I dropped the ball, and it just didn't bounce.

05:42.477 --> 05:43.518
Yeah. Well, I don't know if I can play this. But you 
can really get that ball going fast. I played it

05:49.146 --> 05:52.951
some before they abolished the squash courts to 
make the reactor. It was the only large place they

05:52.971 --> 05:55.294
could find to do it. So they did this under the old 
football stands at the university. They... only

06:06.303 --> 06:12.893
had a small number of people cleared with a 
security clearance to do this work. And you didn't

06:12.913 --> 06:18.221
have any manual laborers at all, because you 
didn't have anybody of that sort with clearance.

06:18.301 --> 06:29.638
So all the graduate students, including myself, 
were drafted to do things like carry the blocks of

06:18.301 --> 06:29.638
carbon onto the pile and so on. And this was heavy, 
dirty work. Yeah, I understand the carbon. real

06:35.176 --> 06:37.759
messy, and it was real slick. Right. I ruined a pair 
of shoes doing

06:40.902 --> 06:45.887
that. Can you tell me about the actual reaction 
when it actually happened to include the guys in

06:45.907 --> 06:56.738
the suicide squad with the buckets of cadmium 
solution?

06:58.800 --> 07:02.584
I don't know as I remember exactly who that was.

07:05.990 --> 07:08.394
I haven't thought of this for a long time. It's in 
some of the standard accounts, of course. Yes. But

07:15.204 --> 07:18.949
what was their purpose, the Suicide Squad? Well, 
just to be sure the thing didn't blow up, it was

07:18.969 --> 07:26.721
completely unchartered territory. And although 
everybody thought they'd taken account of

07:26.801 --> 07:35.153
everything in the calculations that could be 
taken account of, how could you really be sure? And

07:35.437 --> 07:47.751
so as an additional safety precaution, they had 
these people there with cadmium in solution,

07:35.437 --> 07:47.751
which is a very strong absorber of neutrons. And if 
anything went wrong, they were to dump it on the

07:48.913 --> 08:00.587
pile, which supposedly would have absorbed the 
excess neutrons and helped stop whatever was

07:48.913 --> 08:00.587
happening that shouldn't. But it didn't go that 
way. Everything worked just beautifully. They

08:04.360 --> 08:16.174
very slowly withdrew the control rods, which of 
course absorb neutrons too, and as they pull them

08:04.360 --> 08:16.174
out, why, the number of neutrons in the pile goes 
up. And it just went up on a beautiful exponential

08:16.194 --> 08:19.118
curve. Right with the calculations in it? Yeah, 
yeah.

08:28.154 --> 08:40.988
Okay, so the reaction, how long did it take from the 
time you started removing the rods until they

08:28.154 --> 08:40.988
decided that the factor was one, that it was a 
self-sustaining reaction?

08:41.008 --> 08:41.508
Oh, dear.

08:45.353 --> 08:50.218
If I had to guess after this long time, I'd say it was 
five or ten minutes, probably. Is that right?

08:52.540 --> 08:52.640
Yeah. Okay. A. H. Compton, in his book, Atomic 
Quest, watches three people's faces during the

08:55.829 --> 08:58.713
reaction. Enrico Fermi, who was cool, in control, 
and showed no sign of elation. Balney Wilson, who

09:05.041 --> 09:09.667
looked troubled because of the destruction that 
reaction implied. And Crawford Greenwald, later

09:10.408 --> 09:17.317
the president of DuPont, the look of a man who had 
seen a miracle, a source of endless power. Did any

09:17.898 --> 09:19.740
of these fit your reaction? Do you remember what 
came to your mind when y'all actually had a

09:19.760 --> 09:24.486
self-sustaining reaction?

09:28.027 --> 09:39.280
Well, I suspect he's reading a lot into the faces of 
those three people in terms of what he knows about

09:28.027 --> 09:39.280
the people.

09:42.324 --> 09:44.687
Well, I suspect a little bit of all those things. It 
certainly was a very humbling moment.

09:49.933 --> 09:55.840
One certainly did a good bit of thinking about 
where all this was taking one. But as I say, at that

09:56.596 --> 10:09.972
point, at least those of us who were graduate 
students didn't know anything about the

09:56.596 --> 10:09.972
tremendous destructive potential that was 
possible.

10:09.992 --> 10:12.015
What type of work did you do after the reaction? 
After that famous day? Well, I just continued

10:15.079 --> 10:18.383
doing theoretical work about it. There were just 
many, many different things that needed to be

10:19.424 --> 10:26.012
worked out to understand it better. And then they 
were also, of course, looking at better ways to

10:26.920 --> 10:37.413
make nuclear reactors with other substances and 
other configurations. Did you give any

10:38.534 --> 10:42.039
consideration in going to Los Alamos? No, it was 
never suggested that this particular group would

10:43.741 --> 10:48.106
go. I see.

10:52.352 --> 10:56.657
So they already had a core of people there that they 
were going to work with? Yeah, now some of the very

10:57.295 --> 11:05.467
top physicists that were at Chicago eventually 
ended up at Los Alamos. And I think they may have

11:05.487 --> 11:10.595
taken a few of their own graduate students with 
them. But no one that was in the group I was in went

11:11.937 --> 11:15.702
there. In fact, we knew very little about it 
because, again, they tried to keep all these

11:21.629 --> 11:24.453
places separate for secret series. Well, did that 
inhibit you then in your research, since

11:24.773 --> 11:32.784
obviously at the University of California you had 
one group of people? What, at Princeton and

11:33.365 --> 11:36.068
Cornell they had a group? The University of 
Chicago? I

11:37.971 --> 11:49.206
think after, say, the end of 1942,

11:37.971 --> 11:49.206
there weren't these groups at all these 
universities. There was the group at the

11:52.241 --> 11:55.645
University of Chicago that did piles. There was 
the group at Oak Ridge that did the diffusion of the

11:55.705 --> 12:01.172
isotopes. There was a group at Los Alamos that did 
the weapons.

12:06.399 --> 12:08.902
And that was about it, wasn't it? Yeah, those were 
the main ones as far as from what I've read in

12:08.922 --> 12:13.928
directing to actually get the weapon. Everything 
I've read, that's the whole, it seemed like that

12:16.743 --> 12:22.389
was, you could say that's the whole ball of wax. 
They were all going toward a weapon,

12:22.409 --> 12:35.224
which now I'm sort of surprised when you told me 
that you all thought the major thrust of your

12:22.409 --> 12:35.224
research was for power. Yeah. Yeah, I don't think 
it was at least until the end of the 40s. that maybe

12:41.954 --> 12:48.580
you have to suspect there might be a lot more to

12:41.954 --> 12:48.580
it. Okay, with the research going on in the 
Superbomb, the FAST reactor project, the large

12:48.600 --> 13:00.991
Van de Graaff accelerator, why did so many 
scientists leave the lab at Los Alamos after 1945?

13:02.292 --> 13:07.817
Was it because they felt their job was over, or the 
uncertainty of the lab's future? Do you know about

13:07.837 --> 13:11.961
some of the feelings of the people who left there?

13:14.725 --> 13:33.511
Well, I suppose there may have been many different 
reasons, but I suspect that a lot of them were just

13:14.725 --> 13:33.511
university scientists that wanted to get back to 
their own research labs and work on their own

13:14.725 --> 13:33.511
projects again after doing this big general 
project. When I first looked at the members of the

13:35.634 --> 13:43.365
Atomic Energy Commission, it was Mr. Pike from the 
Security Exchange Commission, Lilienthal from

13:44.088 --> 13:59.425
the Tennessee Valley Authority, Wayne Rack, a 
newspaper editor, Strauss, who was a partner in

13:44.088 --> 13:59.425
Kuhn, Loeb & Company, and the only scientist was 
Robert Baish from Cornell. Why was there such a

14:00.226 --> 14:06.733
lack of scientists on the Atomic Energy 
Commission when it first formed? I haven't any

14:06.753 --> 14:08.575
idea. You think it was just a political commission 
then? No idea on that. I really don't know that.

14:19.639 --> 14:25.585
What role did the Atomic Energy Commission play in 
encouraging nuclear research? You mean during

14:27.847 --> 14:29.689
the war or after? After the war, yes. Well, of 
course, they started funding research at many

14:33.212 --> 14:42.782
universities, so in that sense they certainly 
encouraged university research.

14:46.340 --> 14:55.773
And they did continue to make Los Alamos quite an 
attractive place for a scientist to be. In what

14:55.793 --> 14:57.295
respect did they do that? Just the number of 
projects they had going on there? Yeah, they had a

15:01.521 --> 15:10.434
lot of projects, good financing, and a lot of 
famous people around which you could contact and

15:01.521 --> 15:10.434
discuss ideas with and so on. I spent one summer 
there a few years after the war. It was really sort

15:17.373 --> 15:22.599
of fantastic, all the great physicists that were 
coming in and out all the time. What did you work on

15:22.619 --> 15:25.863
there that summer? Can you tell me? Yeah, it really 
didn't have anything to do with what they were

15:27.906 --> 15:34.734
primarily interested in. It was just a new way of 
formulating the theory of gravity.

15:43.905 --> 15:46.688
So it takes care of the Atomic Energy Commission.

15:51.275 --> 15:59.126
Why was the development of atomic power plants so 
slow at this time when compared to research on

15:51.275 --> 15:59.126
weapons? Even after the war, the material I've 
read, a lot of the efforts were directed toward

15:59.767 --> 16:11.303
more bigger, better weapons and not towards power 
plants. Were the engineering and technical

16:12.144 --> 16:17.552
aspects just that tremendous or untenable or... 
Or why was it the emphasis on weapons rather than

16:18.123 --> 16:22.328
power?

16:32.141 --> 16:36.207
I don't know because I'm really competent to 
answer that. I suppose.

16:43.165 --> 16:51.653
The considerable amount of this was funded by 
military funds, and this necessarily gave it a

16:43.165 --> 16:51.653
push in that direction.

16:53.635 --> 16:57.119
They felt that was the more urgent problem.

16:59.601 --> 17:11.333
We obviously haven't had an energy shortage in 
this country until recent years, and so that

16:59.601 --> 17:11.333
wasn't an urgent problem.

17:11.566 --> 17:29.576
familiar with the Price Anderson Act, where they 
will fund, I think it's 75 to something less than

17:11.566 --> 17:29.576
all but $96 million if there's

17:11.566 --> 17:29.576
an accident at nuclear power plants. The federal 
government will fund, you know, it's like

17:30.298 --> 17:33.523
insurance. Do you think that had some effect then 
on increasing research in power plants and

17:34.482 --> 17:42.153
bringing more power plants online afterwards? 
Well, I'm sure encouraged bringing more online.

17:49.082 --> 17:56.492
Do you think that had anything to do with the 
increased number of cyclotrons and synchrotrons

17:49.082 --> 17:56.492
and other accelerators? Do you think research for 
power reactors had more to do with that than, say,

18:00.318 --> 18:04.743
research for weapons. And having more 
accelerators built? Yes. I doubt if there's a

18:11.211 --> 18:17.859
tremendous connection

18:11.211 --> 18:17.859
there. There isn't that much you can do with 
accelerators to

18:17.879 --> 18:27.270
elucidate what's happening with reactors. I 
suppose you need to measure a lot of these

18:27.993 --> 18:36.066
cross-sections better.

18:36.346 --> 18:47.644
I think the main reason all the accelerators were 
built at universities is just that there was a lot

18:36.346 --> 18:47.644
of new nuclear physics, and the physicists wanted 
to

18:36.346 --> 18:47.644
do them. I remember they built one here.

18:51.871 --> 18:55.956
They were originally going to build one in West 
Virginia or something like that. And the guy in

18:55.976 --> 19:01.824
charge of the Atomic Energy Commission at the time 
was from Texas A&M. Oh, really? Yeah. So that's how

19:03.807 --> 19:06.490
we got our cyclotron. He redirected it down here. 
They had the whole scene set up there. I'm pretty

19:13.900 --> 19:17.384
sure it was either the University of Virginia or 
the University of West Virginia. They had

19:17.404 --> 19:18.185
everything. I actually had a site funded in the 
whole business. And then they changed the line

19:22.178 --> 19:31.550
just because this guy was an Aggie, and they built 
the cyclotron here instead of there. I was

19:31.570 --> 19:37.037
surprised to read that, too. After reading parts 
of the reactor safety study by the Nuclear

19:37.138 --> 19:49.013
Regulatory Commission and the review of that by 
the Union of Concerned Scientists, I was

19:37.138 --> 19:49.013
surprised at the odds of some types of reactor 
accidents occurring and the damage that would

19:49.853 --> 19:53.937
occur. Do you think reactors are relatively safe 
as a physicist? I think so. I think so. The problems

20:04.567 --> 20:17.920
are all really engineering ones of water pipes 
that spring leaks and, you know, just

20:04.567 --> 20:17.920
down-to-earth daily problems of that sort. And

20:19.047 --> 20:28.061
there are just so many engineering problems of 
that sort. So it's not really a scientific problem

20:28.382 --> 20:32.088
when you get down to it. No. What improvements do 
you think they could make as far as nuclear

20:34.151 --> 20:38.558
reactors?

20:49.523 --> 20:53.306
Well, I don't know if there's really that much. I 
think it's more a question of having well-trained

20:53.326 --> 21:04.136
operators and having them built well and being 
sure there are no defects in these materials when

20:53.326 --> 21:04.136
they go in. It seems to me that's where they've 
gotten in trouble in all the cases where they have.

21:11.303 --> 21:11.563
Okay. The scope of the study was real narrow, only 
quantifying the The risks from the reactor

21:17.722 --> 21:24.852
itself, nothing to do with mining, enrichment, 
transportation. Are these problems just too

21:25.673 --> 21:32.863
large, or are the risks insignificant?

21:32.883 --> 21:45.720
From those aspects, the mining aspects and 
enrichment, moving it from one place to the next,

21:32.883 --> 21:45.720
do you think that those present a risk Probably 
more than the reactor itself, or very little risk

21:46.713 --> 21:54.663
at all. Well, of course, anything a human does 
involves some risk.

22:02.732 --> 22:12.003
I know that you see studies that have been made of 
the risk in getting a ton of coal to burn in your

22:02.732 --> 22:12.003
power plant. Some people claim that more lives are 
lost doing this than could possibly have in

22:16.430 --> 22:20.715
getting the same amount of energy from a nuclear 
reactor.

22:25.481 --> 22:32.830
Now, the things you're speaking of here are really 
essentially the same things you have in

22:25.481 --> 22:32.830
transporting coal, aren't they? Yeah, mining is 
just as dangerous. Mining isn't a great

22:35.734 --> 22:39.298
occupation. Okay. And the final thing is, did the 
scientists who were in that room on the 2nd of

22:41.048 --> 22:53.002
December, did they bear any of the responsibility 
for the proliferation of nuclear weapons or

22:41.048 --> 22:53.002
accidents from reactors?

22:56.506 --> 23:03.174
Well, some of them, of course, formed the 
Federation of Atomic Scientists. I think that's

23:03.194 --> 23:08.880
been quite a political force and has been quite a 
lot through the years. educating people,

23:09.653 --> 23:15.861
particularly the legislators, as to what should 
happen. I suspect that's the main positive thing

23:18.223 --> 23:25.072
they've done, other than just individually 
giving talks and things like that. It's hard. So

23:27.114 --> 23:35.104
the main, uh, you feel that the main reason then for 
this type of, uh, for all the main nuclear

23:35.523 --> 23:57.120
research, the only way you can have it is with 
federal funding and that most of the things that

23:35.523 --> 23:57.120
come about from it are things that the only reason 
for them is because of the direction that the

23:35.523 --> 23:57.120
research has got to go because of the funding 
that's involved to begin with. In other words, you

23:57.140 --> 23:58.442
know, for military purposes, is that the reason 
that we have a lot of nuclear weapons? Because the

24:04.678 --> 24:13.931
funding in nuclear research came from the 
Department of Defense rather than from, let's

24:04.678 --> 24:13.931
say, the Department of Energy now. Well, are we 
talking about just this narrow field or all of

24:15.854 --> 24:21.923
nuclear physics research? All of nuclear physics 
research. Well, I think this is just this very

24:24.847 --> 24:28.412
small part of that. And although the Department of 
Defense funds some of it, I don't think they're the

24:29.320 --> 24:41.134
major source of funds anymore. The Department of 
Energy has funded a great deal of it.

24:50.144 --> 24:51.165
Other agencies of the government.

24:54.168 --> 24:55.690
Well, thank you very much, Dr. Foss. I enjoyed it.
