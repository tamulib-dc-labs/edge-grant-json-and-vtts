00:03.760 --> 00:16.197
When you go about building a model of ecosystems or 
fish populations or whatever you should like to

00:03.760 --> 00:16.197
say, you rely primarily upon marine food chain 
systems to put this together? Yeah, I think the

00:18.140 --> 00:33.261
answer is, yeah, the food chains and, of course, 
also the impact of the physical and chemical

00:18.140 --> 00:33.261
environment that you might say the abiotic 
factors that are a part of the ecosystem and are

00:18.140 --> 00:33.261
influencing abundance trends and abundance and 
distribution and behavior. So I think these

00:36.200 --> 00:41.605
things all ultimately have to be built into a 
model. And food chain models are built at the

00:42.286 --> 00:47.031
present time. There's no problem in building a 
food chain model. I think the problem is really

00:51.595 --> 00:56.100
verifying its reliability and sensitivity. And I 
think this is much more difficult. particularly

01:01.456 --> 01:16.395
if one is going to use that model as a basis for 
judgment in terms of a decision of do I stop this

01:01.456 --> 01:16.395
fishery at this point, or do I leave so much food in a 
particular forage fish for marine mammals, et

01:01.456 --> 01:16.395
cetera. Those sorts of questions

01:16.736 --> 01:23.985
require the empirical verification of the model. 
And we're not in that position at the present time.

01:27.169 --> 01:30.433
I think we're moving towards that sort of 
situation where we're measuring a sufficient

01:30.937 --> 01:36.302
number of parameters over a sufficient time frame 
that we can essentially start to put a picture

01:30.937 --> 01:36.302
together. But I say that's still downstream. Now, 
I have a lot of hang-ups with some of our existing

01:39.585 --> 01:43.869
models. And I realize that they're deficient in a 
lot of ways. They're deficient in my view, not only

01:48.654 --> 01:59.644
in the terms of the fact that it's difficult to get 
the data, but also I have some real questions about

01:48.654 --> 01:59.644
the underlying assumption some of the single 
species model, and even some of the multiple

02:00.198 --> 02:06.147
species models that have been put together. I 
guess the care, I think, that needs to be taken in

02:06.948 --> 02:18.286
this is not to bind the hands of modelers. Because I 
say this, I guess I'm a fairly applied sort of

02:18.366 --> 02:23.293
individual. But still, I think that modelers must 
essentially continue to be somewhat out ahead of

02:28.548 --> 02:34.233
the types of information that we can put into 
models. They've got to develop and conceptualize

02:34.273 --> 02:41.700
models that provide a conception of what the 
system is likely to be like. It's ultimately then

02:41.760 --> 02:52.410
up to us that are doing some of the verification of 
this is to ultimately see if we can find places

02:41.760 --> 02:52.410
where these things seem to fit. And if they don't 
fit, what's wrong with the model and how that may

02:52.890 --> 02:58.335
ultimately be adjusted. I think modelers have 
outstripped our capability of data input at the

02:58.855 --> 03:04.724
present time. But I still don't think that ought to 
in any way prejudice moving ahead with the

03:05.405 --> 03:10.313
modeler. I guess what I do think, though, that the 
minute the modeler thinks he is in a position to

03:10.333 --> 03:26.078
make judgments that are going to influence you, 
myself, and thousands of people in society, then

03:10.333 --> 03:26.078
we better be fairly sure that that model has some 
credibility. I think a lot of models, both

03:26.480 --> 03:35.757
economic and biological at the present time, are 
pretty good for textbooks, but have very little

03:26.480 --> 03:35.757
utility and application.

03:38.382 --> 03:40.646
Is there any exact way one can check a model? That's 
what always bothers me. I don't think there is any

03:42.249 --> 03:46.497
precise way, except that one starts to use a model 
And I guess what I use the term that many of the

03:47.067 --> 04:01.329
modelers use is after you look at some of your data 
and you become fairly sure that you have a

03:47.067 --> 04:01.329
reasonable degree of precision and accuracy in 
your data, suddenly the model blows up on you. Then

04:01.389 --> 04:07.999
you better decide there's something that the 
model isn't properly taking account of. What kind

04:08.019 --> 04:14.509
of studies are now in progress at your 
institution? Well, the institution now has been

04:15.316 --> 04:19.902
formulated into just what I told you I hope to do. 
And by the way, there are four such groups now in the

04:19.982 --> 04:22.505
country. There's one here in Seattle, one at Woods 
Hole, one down in Miami, and one in La Jolla. And

04:27.671 --> 04:32.316
they sort of take large-scale ecosystems. The La 
Jolla lab deals with the tropic, semi-tropical

04:32.757 --> 04:38.544
area. We deal with the temperate Arctic 
environments. And the same thing with Woods Hole

04:41.668 --> 04:43.710
on the other side. They do it for the northern half 
of the US in the same sort of environments. And

04:48.295 --> 04:54.103
Miami does it in the south, east part of the United 
States. And so we have a very broad range of studies

04:54.123 --> 05:01.714
under these conglomerate labs that now represent 
centers. And we have been able to put the

05:02.715 --> 05:05.018
facilities. We have probably some of the most 
modern electron microscopes in the world here at

05:05.038 --> 05:10.386
this particular center. We probably have one of 
the only very highly sophisticated electronic

05:15.442 --> 05:20.807
analysis of hydrocarbons and hydrocarbon 
components in this particular facility here. And

05:20.867 --> 05:42.208
we do a lot of work for people all over the country in 
that particular in terms of a hydrocarbon

05:20.867 --> 05:42.208
analytical lab and where we essentially have 
facilities that examines electronically and

05:20.867 --> 05:42.208
looks and decides what the components are that 
we're looking at, both in the tissue and both in

05:20.867 --> 05:42.208
terms of the, well, various water samples, et 
cetera. so that we have that capability. We

05:44.430 --> 05:49.076
provide that more as a service rather than a 
scientific study. In other words, we've got an

05:49.096 --> 06:00.310
analytical facility here in hydrocarbons that is 
really a lab that provides a national focus in

05:49.096 --> 06:00.310
looking at samples coming from all over the 
country. The actual studies then on, for example,

06:00.651 --> 06:12.145
the fate and effect of, say, hydrocarbons is done 
by another group here of the scientists that uses

06:00.651 --> 06:12.145
the analytical facility as a major facility to get 
some of their analysis run. But we have, let's say,

06:15.271 --> 06:22.082
about six major areas that I'd like to point out to 
you that I think are important. One, we have a very,

06:22.103 --> 06:37.828
very strong group that are looking at the whole 
area of essentially the environment in terms of

06:22.103 --> 06:37.828
contaminants in the environment or substances in 
their environment and their impact and fate and

06:22.103 --> 06:37.828
effect on the biological community. And we're 
sort of taking a whole clinical approach in that.

06:42.105 --> 06:52.635
We're not just running the so-called, well, we 
expose something to this sort of concentration

06:42.105 --> 06:52.635
level and 50% of the animal died so type of thing. 
This is the type of thing that's been done to a large

06:52.655 --> 06:56.738
extent in many areas. What we're doing is more 
setting up just like you would in a pathology lab in

06:57.199 --> 07:07.748
a hospital, where we're looking at the health of 
the animal, We're looking at it at a cellular

07:07.981 --> 07:09.723
level. We're looking at it at an organ level. We're 
looking at it at the whole animal level. We're

07:14.429 --> 07:21.978
looking at it how it impacts on the animal's 
capacity to behave and respond to various

07:14.429 --> 07:21.978
stimuli, et cetera. So we're using a 
multidiscipline approach of physiologists,

07:22.298 --> 07:34.613
behaviorists, chemists, et cetera, and looking 
at a range of things in terms of that animal. how

07:35.082 --> 07:38.566
much of the particular substance is ingested into 
the animal. We want to know where it goes in the

07:38.606 --> 07:40.468
animal. We want to know what cellular damage it 
does to the animal. We want to know how the animal is

07:44.412 --> 07:51.160
capable of purging the toxic materials, if he is, 
and over what time frames, et cetera. We want to

07:51.480 --> 07:55.004
know how that alters his capacity to live in his 
environment. And that's a very strongly oriented

07:56.206 --> 08:02.052
program here under a fellow named Dr. Malins, who 
we're coming out with. two books under academic

08:02.470 --> 08:05.313
press on this this summer. That's a strong 
component of the program up here in looking at the

08:06.494 --> 08:15.923
impact of contamination in the ocean environment 
on the biota itself. We have another very large

08:16.584 --> 08:28.495
group that's looking at the population structure 
and dynamics of the resources and the

08:16.584 --> 08:28.495
consequences of man's intervention, both in 
terms of the mortality he imposes as a result of

08:28.660 --> 08:46.121
direct exploitation and the more indirect 
consequences that he imposes on that same group of

08:28.660 --> 08:46.121
animals through altering the environment, 
either in the estuary in terms of salmon, both in

08:28.660 --> 08:46.121
the freshwater environment or in the marine 
environment. So their job is basically one of

08:47.182 --> 08:52.508
modeling what's going on in that whole world. and 
providing us the information upon which we have

08:53.028 --> 08:58.714
direct input to the consuls for management 
decisions. That's a very sort of applied thing

08:58.734 --> 09:03.639
where a certain number of reports have to come out 
on each year. This population went up. This

09:05.080 --> 09:06.442
population went down. The complex is in this 
particular situation. These are our clinical

09:11.046 --> 09:14.750
sort of determinations of the condition of the 
stock. They're highly parasitized or not, this

09:14.770 --> 09:17.272
and that. They're growing well. They're not. And 
these decisions are then ground into the

09:20.146 --> 09:27.395
management plans which the consuls are using to 
manage the resources throughout the

09:20.146 --> 09:27.395
northeastern Pacific. We've got a big program in 
marine mammals with the same sort of complex of

09:28.317 --> 09:44.938
studies going on, of looking at sort of a broad 
range of their dynamics, what's happening to

09:28.317 --> 09:44.938
those in numbers, how man's impacting on those, 
whether they're natural, how the natural

09:28.317 --> 09:44.938
environment's impacting on those. And those are 
fairly well wedded. It sounds like I'm talking

09:47.220 --> 10:07.809
about two independent studies, but we have sort of 
a matrix approach, particularly the people that

09:47.220 --> 10:07.809
are in the ecosystem group that draw on the marine 
mammal people, that draw on the people that are

09:47.220 --> 10:07.809
doing the population studies, that draw on the 
people that are overdoing the studies in terms of

09:47.220 --> 10:07.809
environmental conservation, the group I talked 
to you about looking at hydrocarbons, et cetera.

10:08.430 --> 10:14.959
We have another group that looks in a very 
utilitarian way at the whole concept How do we

10:15.412 --> 10:18.056
develop good fish products? The government has 
long had essentially a fisheries technology

10:18.577 --> 10:24.967
program that looks at preservation. It looks at 
developing new products such as fish protein

10:25.247 --> 10:43.275
concentrate, new derivatives from oil that are 
useful in the industry or in agriculture, et

10:25.247 --> 10:43.275
cetera, so that we have a unit that essentially 
works in food technology as specific as it relates

10:25.247 --> 10:43.275
to marine organisms.

10:44.977 --> 10:52.252
We have a group that we call, essentially, 
resource survey that does a lot of the basic

10:44.977 --> 10:52.252
survey. And we've sort of separated this out 
because it's a mixture, really, of technicians

10:52.513 --> 10:58.525
and scientists. They gather a lot of the basic data 
at sea that's being used by many people in the

10:59.447 --> 11:04.437
center. And rather than having a lot of my 
scientists throughout the center that are very

11:05.075 --> 11:21.619
high well-paid scientists after they've had some 
of their early years exposure going to see all the

11:05.075 --> 11:21.619
time, we have a group of people that are 
essentially well-trained to develop

11:05.075 --> 11:21.619
experimental design. How should a program be 
developed to go out here and sample species X? They

11:26.566 --> 11:32.314
carry out the surveys and essentially accumulate 
the information and bring these back to the the

11:33.087 --> 11:40.215
various units that are working throughout the 
center that are essentially applying that

11:33.087 --> 11:40.215
information in their science. So it's really the 
at-sea group. It does have a kernel of top

11:43.899 --> 11:48.765
scientists that know what that business is all 
about. Underneath that, there's a broad range of

11:49.706 --> 12:02.520
technicians that are going to see taking water 
samples, measuring fish, taking age samples,

11:49.706 --> 12:02.520
looking at the gut of fish and looking for 
parasitization and collecting tissue samples,

11:49.706 --> 12:02.520
et cetera. I probably missed something. Oh, we 
have another group that's majorly involved in

12:07.509 --> 12:15.638
developing better tools to do the job. There are, 
in other words, engineers, engineered

12:15.678 --> 12:28.272
biologists group that are saying if a guy over here 
needs this type of patrol to carry out his

12:15.678 --> 12:28.272
sampling, he takes it to them and essentially they 
put it together. If you want to know how

12:28.589 --> 12:32.874
effectively that is, they do the measurements. 
They set up the acoustical arrays for the system.

12:35.337 --> 12:39.623
They set up the underwater televisions for the 
people, et cetera. And I guess they're what we call

12:40.083 --> 12:47.512
gear technicians and gear specialists that 
essentially take on specific tasks. For example,

12:47.613 --> 12:52.899
they're the group that's tied up in solving this 
porpoise tuna program down in California. We've

12:52.919 --> 12:56.824
let our key engineer that's involved in design of 
nets to go down there and design and work with the

12:57.158 --> 13:11.895
industry in designing a net that will essentially 
selectively take the tuna while at the same time

12:57.158 --> 13:11.895
having minimum impact on the porpoise of the area. 
We have the same thing going on in the North Pacific

13:11.915 --> 13:24.229
where we've got a conflict between fishermen who 
fish for crab, don't want to see trawlers bring

13:11.915 --> 13:24.229
their nets through and kill off a lot of their 
crawls and trawls, excuse me, their crabs in a

13:11.915 --> 13:24.229
certain area. These people then looking at 
designing, can I design a trawl that fishes one and

13:24.547 --> 13:37.025
a half meter off the bottom, takes most of the fish 
the trawler is interested in, but doesn't bother

13:24.547 --> 13:37.025
the crabs. And this has been quite successful. 
We're now in an era, I think, over the next 20 years,

13:38.387 --> 13:54.250
if we're really going to have effective 
utilization and not, while you're out trying to

13:38.387 --> 13:54.250
get one species, be destroying 15 others, is 
develop systems that are essentially what we call

13:38.387 --> 13:54.250
selective harvest methods. in terms of having 
minimum impact or consequences on other elements

13:54.601 --> 13:59.646
of the biota. And that's their major job.

14:03.591 --> 14:11.119
Now, one of the gentlemen who worked for you, whom I 
talked to yesterday, is very optimistic about

14:03.591 --> 14:11.119
what amounts to mariculture.

14:12.741 --> 14:14.002
That's one I missed. I'm sorry I did that, because I 
support that program over at Manchester. We have

14:17.946 --> 14:22.431
an aquaculture mariculture program. We also, 
some of our food technologists are involved with

14:22.715 --> 14:25.599
this. And again, I say we have a matrix of people. We 
have some of our physiologists and

14:28.583 --> 14:37.976
nutritionalists that are over working with our 
people at Manchester, which is our facility to do

14:28.583 --> 14:37.976
this sort of work at the center here. We also have 
one up at Oak Bay. And we see some major

14:41.361 --> 14:51.895
possibilities, particularly over the long term, 
of making some major advances in this area. And so I

14:52.263 --> 14:55.427
think you're reasonably optimistic concerning 
it too. Is that fair to say? Yeah, but I don't like to

14:56.247 --> 14:58.330
go out. I think there's been a little, and I know in 
your part of the world, you've probably run into

14:58.350 --> 15:10.063
this, a little over-optimistic that you can do 
things overnight where you've got to develop the

14:58.350 --> 15:10.063
technical capability, the engineering 
capability. You've got to get into the genetics

15:10.403 --> 15:21.055
area like we've done in many aspects of 
agriculture so that we ultimately are growing the

15:10.403 --> 15:21.055
right thing in the right environment with minimal 
cost and labor input into it.

15:25.658 --> 15:27.040
You're giving advice to a young student. What 
specific kind of oceanography would you ask him to

15:28.703 --> 15:33.270
go to? Well, you know, I think the whole field is a 
tremendously interesting area, and there's so

15:35.914 --> 15:47.312
many interesting things going on in the ocean, I 
don't like to say one is more important than the

15:35.914 --> 15:47.312
other. I'm going to sound like a contradiction, 
but I really think when I'm watching, by the way,

15:48.659 --> 15:58.918
I'm a professor over at the university, and I'm in 
the Institute of Marine Studies in the College of

15:48.659 --> 15:58.918
Fisheries. I think the numbers of people coming 
out in the biological area are more than adequate,

16:00.300 --> 16:08.115
let's say, to fill the jobs. In fact, we may be 
getting too many people in this particular area.

16:12.790 --> 16:21.438
And I think it would be unfortunate that if we 
encourage more people than there are jobs,

16:12.790 --> 16:21.438
particularly if that's why they took the 
education. Because I can just see us getting in a

16:21.498 --> 16:28.805
position with a large number of people trained up 
for PhDs and adequate number of jobs. I see some

16:28.925 --> 16:32.129
other areas coming on, though. The whole area of 
deep sea mining and the nodule business and the

16:32.229 --> 16:42.038
environmental consequences of that activity. 
the engineering aspects of that type of activity.

16:46.069 --> 17:05.022
I guess where I see the greatest demand, and this is 
going to be a very difficult task,

16:46.069 --> 17:05.022
in oceanography in the future, other than the pure 
sciences, is really people who are capable of

16:46.069 --> 17:05.022
dealing with multiple-use conflicts. going to 
have conflicts between the people who want to mine

17:05.457 --> 17:31.077
and take sand and gravel and the people who want to 
develop transportation and facilities and

17:05.457 --> 17:31.077
people are going out after oil and essentially 
just a tremendous you might say invasion of the

17:05.457 --> 17:31.077
oceans in terms of both for its resources for 
recreational purposes and each one of these has an

17:05.457 --> 17:31.077
interaction and i guess those individuals who 
have some perception in a broad sense of the

17:31.698 --> 17:59.629
multiple use conflicts and can draw on the 
scientists in the special specialities in an

17:31.698 --> 17:59.629
effective way are they going to be the people in 
terms of a managerial sense that are going to

17:31.698 --> 17:59.629
answer questions in a scientific sense i think all 
the all the areas are still extremely interesting

17:31.698 --> 17:59.629
and and i think they're moving ahead whether it's 
in biology physical oceanography geological

17:31.698 --> 17:59.629
oceanography biological oceanography, I think 
the whole range is still pretty wide open. I guess

18:05.729 --> 18:09.232
I'm just sort of drawn up in it. I don't like to say, 
boy, there's only one interesting field in

18:09.332 --> 18:14.697
oceanography, because there isn't. But I think 
oceanography and oceanographers have had to come

18:16.679 --> 18:27.810
to grips with something that some of them don't 
like all that well, is they're being forced more

18:16.679 --> 18:27.810
and more to orient some of their activities toward 
problem areas. And that big problem area I see is

18:31.248 --> 18:37.007
multiple use conflict over the next two to three 
decades.
