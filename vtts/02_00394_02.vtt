WEBVTT

00:04.942 --> 00:06.804
But the press relations with the Union? What's 
that? Who were some of the press and journalists

00:09.287 --> 00:16.856
who sided with the seamen or helped them 
propaganda-wise? How was Heywood Broon? Oh,

00:19.979 --> 00:22.542
Heywood Broon was very good. He was very good in 
labor generally. I just for the moment can't

00:25.966 --> 00:32.974
remember what he wrote about the NMU, about the 
seamen. I remember once he gave quite a boost to the

00:35.401 --> 00:40.406
Daily Worker. He recommended that everyone who 
wanted to keep informed should read the New York

00:41.628 --> 00:48.535
Times and the Daily Worker, those two papers. And 
he was writing for another paper.

00:57.685 --> 01:00.387
That's quite interesting. In the 1920s, how many 
people were you familiar with? who were in the

01:04.240 --> 01:11.589
generation of the 1920s besides that hung around 
with the John Reed crowd. How's that? Who were some

01:14.692 --> 01:22.522
other personalities whom you were familiar with 
when you were a journalist in the 20s and in the 30s?

01:23.783 --> 01:30.010
Ezra Pound or Faulkner or Hemingway or any of these 
personalities? I didn't know Hemingway. One of my

01:31.915 --> 01:38.963
very good friends on the paper who died, Joe North, 
knew Hemingway very well from Spain. I was in Spain

01:39.884 --> 01:42.907
too, but after Hemingway was out. Well, when did 
you go to Spain? I was the last American reporter of

01:47.031 --> 01:52.337
any kind in Madrid.

01:55.420 --> 01:59.104
I got there at the

02:01.396 --> 02:17.453
The very end of, let's see, the end of, probably the 
last day of February, or the first of March, 1939,

02:01.396 --> 02:17.453
when the war was lost. But I'd been fighting to get 
over there for some time. And finally the decision

02:21.437 --> 02:28.264
was, in the paper, well, even though whether 
there's any chance of winning the war or not, we

02:29.189 --> 02:36.898
should be there. Because on the surface, the war 
seemed lost, but if it could hang on, the

02:38.881 --> 02:49.534
international situation might possibly change, 
you see. Anyhow, Hemingway was already out, and

02:59.412 --> 03:00.393
I got to Madrid.

03:03.858 --> 03:11.888
First,

03:03.858 --> 03:11.888
it was very difficult to get into Spain.

03:15.053 --> 03:28.170
Air France used to have a plane flying from 
Toulouse to Barcelona, then to Valencia. then to

03:28.808 --> 03:32.593
Alicante, and then to Oran in Algeria. But it had 
cut out the three Spanish stations. It said it

03:39.523 --> 03:47.835
would fly direct to Oran, and sometimes there'd be 
a flight from Oran then to Alicante and back. Well,

03:49.037 --> 03:50.920
I took a chance. It was a sheer gamble. I flew from 
Toulouse to Oran. There I,

04:00.145 --> 04:09.497
the representative of Air France there was a young 
Englishman. He also represented Cook's Tours.

04:12.341 --> 04:13.362
You know about that. And he said to me, no chance of 
getting on the plane to Iran. We're booked for the

04:18.368 --> 04:20.031
next two flights. There are two flights a week. And 
no chance. Well, I sized him up. I talked to him a

04:30.285 --> 04:31.126
little. I found he was a rather lonely, 
disgruntled young man. He was unhappy on his job. I

04:37.876 --> 04:44.065
told him that I was a little lonely, and I would like 
to have a drink with him. It lasted for hours. And in

04:47.390 --> 04:55.903
the morning, he told me at the end, be sure to be at 
the office at 8 o'clock in the morning. And he

04:55.968 --> 05:00.715
pushed me in ahead of some people who were 
screaming, indignantly. So I got to Alicante,

05:01.737 --> 05:11.271
and all that was left of the Popular Front then was 
the Communist Party. The others had deserted.

05:18.101 --> 05:25.131
The anarchists had went with the fifth column. uh 
the uh the uh left the left socialists supported

05:26.090 --> 05:56.029
the government yes no i would say no the left 
socialists like the green uh and uh del vallo uh

05:26.090 --> 05:56.029
state pat i was incorrect to saying that the 
communists were the only one but they were the they

05:26.090 --> 05:56.029
were the only big organized force behind behind 
the the government well after three days in uh in

05:26.090 --> 05:56.029
alicante which is in southern Spain, I got a ride, a 
hitchhike, to Valencia. After four days in

06:02.855 --> 06:10.163
Valencia, I got another ride to Madrid.

06:10.203 --> 06:22.037
When I got to Madrid at noon, I was told that the 
fifth column would strike any minute was there.

06:22.778 --> 06:24.480
You may have heard of the fifth column. There was a 
Spanish general named Mola, a fascist general,

06:25.253 --> 06:40.798
who once said earlier in the war, we have four 
columns marching on Madrid and we have a fifth

06:25.253 --> 06:40.798
column in Madrid which will strike when we come 
there. Well, that fifth column that night rose at

06:42.741 --> 06:47.469
midnight. The next morning, I went down to the I was 
staying in a

06:53.317 --> 07:00.685
certain house. I went down and there was only one, 
it was Monday, only one paper was published on

07:01.866 --> 07:08.854
Monday. It was the anarchist paper. It was filled 
with the fifth column manifestos.

07:15.642 --> 07:18.645
And the anarchists were on that side. Their theory 
was that that we'll get rid of the communists, then

07:22.477 --> 07:27.384
we'll make a revolution. Well, some of them 
believed that, but the leaders knew what they were

07:27.804 --> 07:31.930
doing. Eventually, after the Fifth Column won, 
they turned things over to Franco without firing a

07:31.970 --> 07:40.561
shot. Real treachery. Well, anyhow, I went down to 
the Mundo Brera, which is the organ of the

07:42.865 --> 07:49.834
Communist Party, And it was guarded by enemy 
troops. But I decided to go inside anyhow, because

07:54.224 --> 07:59.610
I knew that the fighting would go on. And I walked 
right into the trap quite consciously. And so our

08:04.295 --> 08:20.091
building was under siege, machine guns rattling 
off the walls.

08:20.847 --> 08:27.716
cutting into the sandbags at the windows, and our 
boys were shooting back. So after

08:29.439 --> 08:38.812
some days there, we were... In the first days, our 
side was winning. The

08:42.957 --> 08:50.027
government forces had recaptured... the the 
government buildings the ministry buildings

08:50.412 --> 09:19.626
franco franco made an attack but he was pushed back 
by an army made up dominated by communists and then

08:50.412 --> 09:19.626
then things changed an anarchist regiment came in 
from guadalajara and the the tide turned against

09:20.230 --> 09:22.153
against the government forces.

09:28.422 --> 09:31.006
So we had to evacuate Monroe Borough. It was a big 
stone building, but we went then into the still

09:32.047 --> 09:39.698
stronger building, the party headquarters. 
After two days there, that had to be given up.

09:50.116 --> 10:08.321
I was with a group of

09:50.116 --> 10:08.321
five other people who were doing, four men and a 
woman, who had been doing radio work behind the

09:50.116 --> 10:08.321
fascist lines. And we were arrested. They almost 
shot us there as we got out in front of a great wall.

10:19.900 --> 10:28.930
There were about 20 fifth columnists there, 
running around like crazy guys with Tommy guns. It

10:28.990 --> 10:32.213
seemed a complete confusion, lack of 
organization. One of them suddenly threw his gun

10:32.654 --> 10:37.900
down on us with a lot of curses, but the man beside 
him jerked it up. Well, that was a tense moment, you

10:39.641 --> 10:41.624
can imagine. And we were taken to the Seguridad 
police headquarters and held there. first

10:50.022 --> 10:58.150
interrogated for some hours in an

10:50.022 --> 10:58.150
upper floor in the press office. Then we were put in 
a cell for the condemned. Well, I don't want to go

11:00.893 --> 11:03.956
into all that detail. It was a pretty grim place 
there, a very tiny little place with a cement floor

11:04.016 --> 11:20.012
and a bloody floor where other prisoners had been, 
wounded men who had been taken out and shot.

11:21.038 --> 11:35.012
There was a German,

11:21.038 --> 11:35.012
an Italian, a Hungarian, and a Frenchman. And in a 
neighboring cell, we could see her sometimes at a

11:35.953 --> 11:46.143
window, was a Portuguese young woman who called 
herself Belgian for security reasons because

11:35.953 --> 11:46.143
they knew she was Portuguese. She would just go out 
like that, you see. because Portugal had a fascist

11:49.085 --> 11:51.548
regime. So, well, this is outside of your story. I 
don't know if you want any more of this. This is

11:59.618 --> 12:01.861
fine. So,

12:01.941 --> 12:11.833
the last day looked like our last day because we 
weren't fed. The food, incidentally, was very

12:11.853 --> 12:15.098
simple. Once a day, A guard would throw in what they 
called a bacalao, which is half a codfish, raw, and

12:17.536 --> 12:28.050
salt. You take two or three mouthfuls and your 
palate's burning. No water with it. And a small

12:34.819 --> 12:36.701
roll. I broke a bridgework on the roll. It was so 
stale.

12:45.380 --> 12:52.168
Then we'd have to pound and scream for Agua, and 
we'd finally get her. But there was one guard who

12:52.208 --> 12:56.013
was rather human. At first, the worst guard would 
poke his head in and say, no Agua. But you'd keep on

13:00.879 --> 13:12.754
pounding and yelling, and finally the guard who 
was somewhat human would take us one by one to the

13:00.879 --> 13:12.754
washroom to get Agua. Well, finally, they had 
stolen my money, the guards. I managed to hide some

13:20.159 --> 13:23.944
of my clothes. But they hadn't, for some reason, 
taken my passport or my fountain pen or my

13:24.665 --> 13:31.613
notebook. So I said to my friends, let's send 
telegrams, write telegrams to our ambassadors.

13:40.865 --> 13:45.331
And mention the names of the most important people 
you can think of as though they were your friends.

13:47.054 --> 13:56.066
They won't transmit the telegrams, but possibly 
this will deter them, you know, what they want to

13:47.054 --> 13:56.066
do, because it looked as though they were to be shot 
that day. And it worked. That is, we gave them to a

13:58.390 --> 14:07.262
guard, and I was taken up to the upper office, 
interrogated. Now, my Spanish was very bad. I

14:08.984 --> 14:10.787
decided not to use it at all. I said I only knew 
American. They tried to ask me where I was staying

14:14.931 --> 14:20.276
and where my baggage was. They talked a little 
French and Spanish, imitated a man lifting

14:20.316 --> 14:27.683
baggage and so forth. But I only knew American. 
Then they brought in a cop who spoke in English,

14:31.347 --> 14:37.213
London English. And I'd interviewed him when he 
was a prisoner of the government side. He had been

14:41.631 --> 14:50.619
liberated by the

14:41.631 --> 14:50.619
victory of the fifth column. Well, I had nothing 
left in my bag, but I just had to use what I had, which

14:51.940 --> 14:58.506
was nothing. And I told him I only knew American, 
not London talk. But it didn't work. But they took

15:06.733 --> 15:07.774
me out. Two cops. Amateurs they were, cops. And put 
their fingers to my throat, meaning it's the death

15:13.540 --> 15:17.186
sign. I'd better tell them where I live. So I took 
them to the embassy. I knew where it was. I hadn't

15:22.734 --> 15:23.496
been there. When I got there, they were very angry. 
They said, Abakadoa, very angry. I said, no, no. So

15:30.126 --> 15:32.931
I hollered at them to ring the bell. There was a gate 
and... a wall of masonry, an iron gate, and behind

15:34.670 --> 15:43.139
that, 25 or 30 feet away, was the big embassy 
building. When I hollered him to push the button,

15:44.020 --> 15:49.186
he immediately, his finger automatically 
pressed it. Well, the first man who came was a

15:51.689 --> 15:54.893
porter who, it turned out, was no good. He was with 
the fascists. But I wouldn't let them ask him to

15:58.076 --> 16:01.440
talk. I'd holler louder than they did. He went back 
for his chief, and the chief was a wonderful guy. He

16:07.010 --> 16:10.194
was a Basque, knew English perfectly. He was a 
custodian. Roosevelt had taken all the diplomats

16:12.556 --> 16:15.339
out. As he said himself after, Spain was my 
greatest mistake. That's recorded by Ambassador

16:19.543 --> 16:23.247
Bowers in the book he wrote 14 years later. 
Roosevelt told him that was his greatest mistake.

16:27.051 --> 16:30.715
It was a terrible mistake because it helped to 
bring on the World War. And you see, denying the

16:32.348 --> 16:45.502
right of closing America's ports to the shipment 
of munitions, which the Spaniards had the money to

16:32.348 --> 16:45.502
pay for. So

16:45.562 --> 17:00.617
we got there, and finally the custodian came. 
Fortunately, he was in. If he hadn't been in, he

17:02.111 --> 17:04.615
said, you wouldn't be alive now. And the argument 
went on for maybe 10 or 15 minutes, shouting on each

17:05.896 --> 17:12.585
side. And

17:12.625 --> 17:18.793
he described me as a tremendously important 
journalist. I certainly didn't, which was an

17:18.813 --> 17:22.237
exaggeration. I didn't look the part. I hadn't 
shaved for a long time, and clothes were dirty. And

17:30.685 --> 17:43.121
finally I said, he was exhausted and he was drawing 
his, trying to recover his strength and I said, I'm

17:30.685 --> 17:43.121
very cold and sick. I wasn't sick, but I was cold and 
I'm hungry. I just want to get inside the wall out of

17:45.844 --> 17:48.988
the wind. Well,

17:49.048 --> 17:56.558
another argument started and finally he talked 
them down and I was to go inside the wall.

17:57.517 --> 17:59.019
Naturally, I didn't stay there. I was set for the 
door as fast as I could. He played football

18:04.106 --> 18:07.371
interference, tried to block them. They knocked 
him aside. But I had the door open. It was a very

18:10.976 --> 18:14.120
heavy door, and I was going in when they grabbed me. 
I pulled them in with me. And so then they were

18:15.402 --> 18:19.368
scared. What would happen to them? One of them put 
his finger to his own throat if he didn't take me

18:21.270 --> 18:25.937
back. He got regrets, but impossible. And a

18:31.468 --> 18:42.442
little sort of an albister burlesque, a little 
interruption here. As I got in, I was Joe Kennedy,

18:43.243 --> 18:54.557
John Kennedy's oldest brother, who died after he 
was in an airplane accident during the war. he came

18:55.398 --> 18:58.082
to me and he asked me a stupid question. What's the 
difference between the Bolsheviks and the

18:59.083 --> 19:02.468
Communists? You know, as soon as I, when I was safe, 
suddenly I began to feel very all in. And before

19:10.099 --> 19:15.487
that, you know, excitement and nerve kept you up, 
but I was in no mood to argue. But, and he told me

19:16.809 --> 19:23.599
that, he explained the difference was that the 
Communists favor a bloody revolution. And the

19:26.388 --> 19:28.892
socialists don't. This was in the embassy? Well, I 
just said to him, their bodies were picked up in

19:31.716 --> 19:35.582
front of this embassy. Who started the blood? I 
said, in the fifth column, one of the leaders is a

19:36.784 --> 19:42.934
right-wing socialist. It was true. There was 
division in the Socialist Party. But the

19:46.699 --> 19:49.003
communists didn't start it. But anyhow, the 
custodian... intervened and he said, please

19:52.216 --> 19:57.742
excuse Mr. Shields, my wife wants to give him some 
deed. Afterwards he said to me, I don't know what

19:59.324 --> 20:04.930
this young man is doing here, he says he can write 
but he can't write. I found out afterwards from my

20:06.572 --> 20:20.907
friends in touch with the embassy and he was 
attached to the embassy in France and that he was

20:06.572 --> 20:20.907
there to negotiate with the fifth column on behalf 
of his father, who was then an ambassador in

20:21.275 --> 20:31.749
London, and working with Chamberlain with the 
appeasement crowd. Roosevelt finally broke with

20:31.789 --> 20:35.133
him and had to drop him.

20:38.037 --> 20:49.071
Well, that's sort of aside from the story, but what 
I did was immediately I persuaded the custodian to

20:38.037 --> 20:49.071
go to the Seguridad and appealed for the safety of 
the men I left behind, and he did it. He intervened

20:55.804 --> 20:57.106
very vigorously. As he told me, he had no authority 
to do it. After all, he was only a custodian, not a

21:00.651 --> 21:03.715
diplomat.

21:06.219 --> 21:06.880
But it worked. I was told afterwards by one of the 
men, a Balderian in Balderia, that they were taken

21:08.883 --> 21:18.957
before a machine gun for execution two hours after 
I left. And then, before the shots were fired, a

21:19.628 --> 21:26.015
policeman ran up and said, the orders are changed. 
Then they were transmitted to Valencia also. I

21:30.579 --> 21:31.620
didn't see them there. And they were almost shot 
when Franco came in, but somehow or other they were

21:32.722 --> 21:40.630
very clever, they took themselves out of it. The 
Italian comrade was shot, he was taken back to

21:42.932 --> 21:48.538
Italy and executed, but the German The German told 
the felonist, the stupid Spanish fascist

21:49.058 --> 22:08.926
representative, that he came from Lubbock, which 
he said is a free city, it's not part of the Reich.

22:09.567 --> 22:15.115
Well, in the Middle Ages it was brought to the 
Hanseatic League of Mercantile Cities, you know.

22:17.077 --> 22:18.880
But they didn't know any better. And they didn't 
shoot him and kept him seven years. He got

22:23.973 --> 22:26.656
tuberculosis, but finally he was sent home. He 
became a well-known author on novels and

22:28.639 --> 22:33.426
decorated afterwards. I met him four years ago. I 
had a very nice meeting with him in Germany.

22:42.838 --> 22:49.187
Well, that's sort of off the National Maritime 
Union.

22:50.264 --> 23:00.096
Back to the union itself, back to the National 
Maritime Union, how long did you cover them for the

22:50.264 --> 23:00.096
daily worker, or the waterfront? Well, I should 
say, through

23:00.116 --> 23:18.077
the 40s, I did other things too, but it was, it took a 
good, it was something I gave major attention to.

23:19.492 --> 23:31.984
Then I was sent to Pittsburgh to a series of trials 
of communist leaders in Pittsburgh.

23:34.967 --> 23:46.119
And two people got a total of 25 years, but in two 
different trials, both state and federal. But all

23:46.259 --> 23:48.621
the cases were thrown out. by the Supreme Court 
eventually. But the trials dragged on. One trial

23:54.561 --> 23:57.464
lasted nine months. There are dramatic moments in 
trials, but most of it's very boresome, sitting

23:59.046 --> 24:06.593
there.

24:09.156 --> 24:13.280
But

24:09.156 --> 24:13.280
someone had to do it. It was a job that had to be done. 
And I could do it.

24:21.473 --> 24:23.195
I like the waterfront work. When you were covering 
the waterfront, what do you consider to be some of

24:24.437 --> 24:31.486
your more important stories that you wrote?

24:37.854 --> 24:47.747
Well,

24:37.854 --> 24:47.747
there was a strike in 1946 that was quite 
important. There were a wave of strikes. going on

24:51.646 --> 24:52.647
at that time. Incidentally, I wasn't only on the 
waterfront. I also covered the steel strike in the

24:54.749 --> 25:00.074
same year, different time of the year. See, after 
the war,

25:02.155 --> 25:13.566
labor struck back, especially the progressive 
forces in labor initiated. Not the

25:13.586 --> 25:21.653
top leaders like Bill Green, William Green, of the 
miners, a very floppy personality. There

25:27.835 --> 25:46.230
was also one

25:27.835 --> 25:46.230
very exciting strike I reported. It was a 
waterfront strike of a kind, a shipyard strike in

25:47.091 --> 25:51.775
Chester. The Sun Oil Company owned a big shipyard 
there. It was a violent strike. I saw two men killed

25:59.974 --> 26:01.856
in front of my eyes. One firetruck ran into the 
picket line, killed him, just ran over him. That

26:12.710 --> 26:13.931
was pretty crude tactics.

26:17.836 --> 26:21.120
But it was a fighting strike. The shipyard 
workers, 4,000, had the help of 600 tanker seamen

26:21.860 --> 26:35.093
employed also by the Sun Oil Company in tankers not 
far away. That

26:35.133 --> 26:49.487
was in the winter strike that led to the formation 
of the National Maritime Union. So they came and

26:50.581 --> 26:59.493
threw their muscles and their fighting spirit 
into the fight with the shipyard workers.

27:02.417 --> 27:03.659
It was very exciting. They

27:05.421 --> 27:17.197
stopped a line of scabs led by goons, gangsters 
armed with lead pipes, and won that battle.

27:18.058 --> 27:19.660
Really, the bodies were dropped. all around the 
place. And it's when the other side was losing that

27:22.901 --> 27:28.668
it brought in the fire truck.

27:31.652 --> 27:34.516
They brought in cops with tear gas, but that didn't 
win. With

27:34.536 --> 27:47.993
the National Maritime Union,

27:34.536 --> 27:47.993
when in— Well, I should say that that— That phase of 
the—that

27:49.880 --> 28:08.764
was the most exciting story, that

27:49.880 --> 28:08.764
particular front of

27:49.880 --> 28:08.764
the winter seaman strike. You know, there was a 
long winter strike that lasted all winter. I was

28:11.908 --> 28:13.930
also in Baltimore during that strike. There was a 
wonderful leader down there. I'll show you his

28:19.555 --> 28:20.557
picture. Patty Whalen, you may have heard of him. 
Yes, I

28:24.803 --> 28:30.772
have. A very well-known artist. She did this. He 
afterwards became head of the CIO in Baltimore. He

28:41.988 --> 28:43.731
was a marine engineer and during the warship was 
torpedoed.

28:48.933 --> 28:53.219
Did you have any contacts with Paddy Whelan in 
1935? With who? Did you have any earlier contacts

28:55.722 --> 28:58.786
with Paddy Whelan? Yeah, well I met him earlier, 
but I didn't know him well until after that we

28:59.386 --> 29:04.593
became very good friends. When he came to New York 
he came to see me. Did you have any contacts with the

29:09.920 --> 29:13.144
ISU pilot? Oh. Any of the editors or the reporters 
there? No. Well, I

29:18.972 --> 29:24.982
had some contact. I was up in the office a couple 
times, two or three times I remember. Did you ever

29:30.471 --> 29:31.593
do any work for them? No, no. Did the Daily Worker 
ever help them to publish their newspaper?

29:42.503 --> 29:53.937
Well, indirectly, yes, because I think the 
reporter we had on the waterfront those days did

29:42.503 --> 29:53.937
some writing for it. I'm not positive, but I have 
that impression. And they had the active moral

29:57.041 --> 30:09.197
support of the people associated with the daily 
worker, of course. See, the waterfront... The

30:12.659 --> 30:26.596
leadership of the

30:12.659 --> 30:26.596
CM at that time was,

30:12.659 --> 30:26.596
much of it was communist.

30:26.897 --> 30:35.187
In your opinion, how long did the communist state 
have a major influence on the National Maritime

30:26.897 --> 30:35.187
Union? And when did they start to lose their power 
in the Union?

30:44.873 --> 31:13.108
The decisive thing in Loss of Power was when

30:44.873 --> 31:13.108
all known communists, and I would say not only 
communists, but most active militants, were

30:44.873 --> 31:13.108
dropped from the maritime roles by the

31:13.409 --> 31:15.392
Coast Guard, the Coast Guard had charge of that. 
Curran, right after he turned, gave a list of

31:16.934 --> 31:32.496
names, you see, to the

31:16.934 --> 31:32.496
Coast Guard, and they couldn't sell any more. That

31:32.516 --> 31:42.049
was probably started in 49.

31:44.324 --> 31:48.370
Then the government acted too. We had a very able 
guy, Ferdinand C. Smith, the

31:50.934 --> 32:01.229
Secretary-Treasurer of the Union, a black man, a 
Jamaican. He was already deported, and Kern was

32:02.471 --> 32:06.316
behind that. He was a communist, a good speaker, 
very influential among the seamen. And

32:14.868 --> 32:23.937
it was a persistent drive. And then, you see, Phil 
Murray had joined the Cold War himself, actually,

32:23.957 --> 32:36.089
in 1947. And he

32:36.410 --> 32:43.677
threw out weight he could against the the 
progressive forces, not only communists,

32:44.433 --> 32:53.406
progressive forces on the waterfront and in other 
unions.

32:56.691 --> 33:00.536
You said earlier that Curran turned. When, in your 
opinion, did he turn his leadership? What? You

33:05.403 --> 33:09.049
said earlier that Curran, after Curran had 
turned. When, in your opinion, do you think he

33:09.910 --> 33:14.136
turned from being a progressive laborer? The open 
turning was seen as early as 1946. Some people who

33:18.833 --> 33:23.838
knew him better claimed that they saw signs 
earlier. In 1946,

33:23.858 --> 33:31.385
Curran broke up the Committee for Maritime Unity. 
I don't know if you've heard of that or not. It was a

33:34.348 --> 33:44.258
joint agreement with the International Long 
Showmen and Warehousemen's Union led by Harry

33:34.348 --> 33:44.258
Bridges. to—for United Action East and West Coast 
Maritime Unions. And Kern walked out of it, pulled

33:53.758 --> 34:10.296
the National Maritime Union out of it, which was a 
dirty—really a treacherous blow.

34:11.862 --> 34:15.287
That was open turning, yes. But he had been 
insidiously working against Smith and others

34:16.088 --> 34:21.035
earlier.

34:23.859 --> 34:30.067
But it was not done so openly that you could be made 
an issue. Perhaps it should have been, I don't

34:31.649 --> 34:33.552
know. Did

34:33.592 --> 34:38.659
you ever know Harry Bridges? Who? Harry Bridges. 
Yes, I know Harry. Incidentally, I'll show you

34:42.878 --> 34:46.461
something.

34:49.424 --> 34:53.427
What were your impressions of Harry Bridges as a 
labor leader?

34:56.550 --> 35:04.076
Offhand, I'd say the best trade union leader the 
United States has seen since the days of William Z.

35:04.116 --> 35:12.784
Foster,

35:04.116 --> 35:12.784
who led the Great Steel Strike and organized the 
packinghouse workers. Did Bridges ever talk to

35:14.840 --> 35:18.984
you about Joe Curran? No, no. No, I didn't know 
Harry very intimately. But

35:25.269 --> 35:32.055
I liked him very much and respected him. We had met, 
and I covered a number of press conferences with

35:33.597 --> 35:39.242
him and so forth. Did you know Jack Lawrenson? Yes. 
And what were your impressions of him? Well,

35:45.961 --> 35:52.027
I would say just fair. He didn't impress me 
greatly, no. In the National Maritime Union, who

35:55.370 --> 36:01.917
do you think was the most dynamic leaders in that 
union? Who were?

36:09.885 --> 36:13.348
Well, I'd say Joe Stack was one of them.

36:14.577 --> 36:24.329
Lucky

36:14.577 --> 36:24.329
Myers, McKenzie.

36:27.953 --> 36:29.736
McKenzie was another vice president.

36:32.419 --> 36:35.423
What about, how dynamic a leader was Ferdinand 
Smith? Well, of course, Ferdinand Smith, yes,

36:35.863 --> 36:39.768
yes, yes. By all means, I... Do you think that it was 
a good idea for these members to challenge Curran

36:42.826 --> 36:56.946
toward the end of the war in 45 and 46? Well, they 
didn't—I don't know that—the war was over in 46. In

37:01.693 --> 37:08.823
45, I don't think he was challenged, so I don't know 
it. And in 46, There wasn't an active challenge,

37:12.087 --> 37:17.916
as I recall. What about in Joe Stack's case? What? 
What about in Joe Stack's case? Well, yeah, that

37:23.884 --> 37:32.497
was in 1947, yes, when Kern had Joe Stack expelled, 
yes. Very dirty job. I

37:33.459 --> 37:38.046
think I was away at the time. I forget where now. 
Anyhow, I wasn't in on that

37:40.454 --> 37:46.101
convention.

37:52.390 --> 38:00.760
Do you think, after the attack at Pearl Harbor, 
that organized laborers no strike pledge? Was

38:01.381 --> 38:02.142
that a good idea? No strike pledge? The principle 
was a good idea. I think sometimes it was carried

38:08.725 --> 38:18.482
out too inflexibly. There

38:18.502 --> 38:28.078
were some cases where employers took advantage of 
it and imposed very terrible conditions. For

38:29.340 --> 38:30.762
instance, I'm thinking of... of coal operators 
who had bad conditions on the ground, you know, men

38:33.172 --> 38:44.803
working in water in very dangerous conditions. 
Though

38:44.903 --> 38:51.529
the miners in such cases sometimes did have 
strikes, you see.

38:54.452 --> 39:00.377
Why do you think John L. Lewis changed his position 
so radically during the war? Well, that's hard to

39:01.606 --> 39:03.789
say. He had

39:03.809 --> 39:12.882
big differences with Louis, I mean with 
Roosevelt. You see, Louis, as I said, changed his

39:14.164 --> 39:21.173
tactics, but his personality hadn't changed so 
much. Louis was a man who wanted power, and

39:22.115 --> 39:31.528
he wanted more recognition from Roosevelt than 
Roosevelt was willing to give him.

39:34.816 --> 39:36.499
He wanted a lot of recognition.

39:41.026 --> 39:55.528
After the war,

39:41.026 --> 39:55.528
what was one of the, in your opinion, some of the 
reasons that brought about this break between

39:41.026 --> 39:55.528
Bridges and Curran, particularly with the CMU? 
Were there any ideological reasons or incidents?

40:02.795 --> 40:04.778
There was a difference of policy there.

40:07.641 --> 40:09.183
Torn took a very bad position. What was that? 
Against the Committee for Maritime Unity. He took

40:15.511 --> 40:17.854
it for bad reasons, I think. In other words, he was 
moving over to a policy of collaboration with the

40:19.016 --> 40:31.992
class enemy rather than struggle with it.

40:36.511 --> 40:39.714
After the war was over... What's that? After the 
war was over, why did Bridges want to continue the

40:40.114 --> 40:48.923
no-strike pledge? Did you ever talk to him about 
that? No, I don't know. I really don't know.

40:56.810 --> 40:59.813
How can I answer that? When did you... What? When 
did you first become associated with the

41:01.315 --> 41:04.678
Communist Party?

41:10.733 --> 41:21.823
Well, I became an open member in 36, but I had worked 
with the party for a long time before. I'd been on

41:21.863 --> 41:26.547
the paper even though not a member of the party at 
that time. It's not a compulsory condition, you

41:27.468 --> 41:30.551
see.

41:33.954 --> 41:38.158
And how long did this continue, your relationship 
with the party? How long did it continue? To the

41:40.586 --> 41:41.087
present? Oh, yes. Ideologically, have you ever 
had any difficulty at times? How do you mean? Have

41:49.536 --> 41:55.803
you ever had any problems or disagreements with 
the party?

41:59.227 --> 42:02.711
Not basic ideological differences. I disagreed 
with some things that Barter was trying to do. For

42:06.275 --> 42:07.757
instance? Well,

42:09.037 --> 42:28.294
I disagreed with his idea that you could,

42:09.037 --> 42:28.294
that you might say the lamb would lie down together

42:09.037 --> 42:28.294
peacefully. In other words, that the American 
monopolies would work with labor after the war. I

42:37.842 --> 42:39.043
just couldn't see that. completely alien to my 
experience. Are there any other instances or

42:45.243 --> 42:56.475
incidents that you can remember, particularly in 
your career as a journalist, in respect to the

42:45.243 --> 42:56.475
waterfront and the maritime labor movement? Yes.

43:01.040 --> 43:02.161
Not at hand right now. I can't remember them, no.

43:06.506 --> 43:08.068
What did you consider to be your greatest piece of 
journalism, or the single piece of—part of your

43:09.348 --> 43:16.137
life that you're the most proud of? It's hard to 
say. There were a lot of—I

43:19.201 --> 43:37.785
suppose the Spanish

43:19.201 --> 43:37.785
War experience would be a tough one, perhaps.

43:40.415 --> 43:42.017
piece of reporting at home. There

43:42.077 --> 43:57.011
would be a couple lynching stories I reported that 
were

43:42.077 --> 43:57.011
very interesting. And then I spent a month in Texas 
in 1953 investigating the McCarthyite oil

43:58.192 --> 44:08.262
barons. I got a series of interviews. I had ten 
features following each other week by week. We had

44:17.542 --> 44:19.664
a Sunday worker at that time.

44:23.649 --> 44:25.631
I didn't tell them I was with a daily worker. I just 
said, I'm a good American. I want to know what

44:29.796 --> 44:33.240
you're doing and tell everyone about it. Did you 
ever come up against any... Any problems,

44:38.532 --> 44:41.836
particularly during the McCarthy era? During 
what? During the McCarthy era? Were you ever

44:43.958 --> 44:46.301
harassed by the government? In Texas or 
elsewhere? Anywhere.

44:53.029 --> 44:56.292
Well...

45:00.657 --> 45:03.661
Harassed, yes, but that's something I could 
carry. In Texas, I mean... Earl Brown was in prison

45:08.738 --> 45:17.989
on a passport case at Roosevelt after his 
community sentence.

45:21.093 --> 45:30.705
While he was in prison, I was sent to Wichita, his 
hometown, to get stories about his boyhood there

45:21.093 --> 45:30.705
and his youth. I got a series of eight articles.

45:38.050 --> 45:40.258
I talked to a lot of people who had known him. The 
last one I talked to was his baseball captain.
