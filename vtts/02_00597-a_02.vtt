00:06.207 --> 00:28.867
More recently, in Ohio,

00:06.207 --> 00:28.867
first of all, during the Vietnam War, we were 
always in there, but we were always arguing

00:06.207 --> 00:28.867
electoral politics, and we were always combining 
the fight for the right to dissent along with the

00:06.207 --> 00:28.867
fight against the Vietnam War. The conclusion of 
all those things, I just had breakfast two

00:35.401 --> 00:38.585
mornings ago with Sid Pack. Dr. Sid Pack was one of 
the organizers of the big mobilization against

00:38.665 --> 00:47.395
the Vietnam War in Washington. I'd known him when 
he was at Milwaukee Downer College and organized

00:49.157 --> 01:01.852
the

00:49.157 --> 01:01.852
Committee of 100 in Milwaukee against UI. Then the 
peace came and Sid leaves He's a professor of

01:05.388 --> 01:14.942
sociology at Clark College somewhere

01:05.388 --> 01:14.942
in Massachusetts. Worcester, I think. 
Worcester, right. So we're seeing each other for

01:18.126 --> 01:20.950
the first time in fifteen years. We're talking 
about this whole change. We never lost track of

01:24.115 --> 01:26.839
each other. It's just that he's one case where we 
never really got him to keep the question of

01:26.879 --> 01:34.129
dissent upper-most of his mind, and it doesn't 
relate to the peace movement. Sid is just

01:39.293 --> 01:51.912
recovering from a horrible violation of his 
academic freedom rights from a student that

01:39.293 --> 01:51.912
accused him of sexual harassment at Clark 
College. He's just fought two years, he's

01:52.293 --> 02:03.390
$100,000 in debt, trying to fight back to get his 
tenured position again, having won, and the

01:52.293 --> 02:03.390
student totally discredited, and the faculty 
leader that tried to fire Sid committing suicide.

02:11.576 --> 02:12.677
Horrible thing. My goodness. Anyway, Sid is now 
back, finally. But it was his own little lesson on

02:17.924 --> 02:23.712
civil liberties, I think, partly involved. I want 
to get you to the classical example. The best

02:27.157 --> 02:33.225
coalition building between all the movements of 
the 60s and 70s, and I think should be even now, is

02:33.813 --> 02:41.400
the American Friends Service Committee in 
Northeastern Ohio. The guy out there, John

02:42.822 --> 02:45.684
Looney, used to be a business person. How do you 
spell his last name? L-O-O-N-E-Y. He's the

02:49.948 --> 02:53.392
Northeastern Ohio director of the American 
Friends Service Committee. Four years ago, as the

02:55.133 --> 03:03.381
Reagan dangers for peace developed, He began a 
series of three conferences in Cleveland, Akron,

03:04.441 --> 03:16.479
Youngstown, called Guns or Butter? One, Guns or 
Butter? Two, Guns or Butter? Three. Obvious

03:20.345 --> 03:32.103
expression of, you know, that issue of the, do we 
put our money into feeding people or into war?

03:32.123 --> 03:33.705
At each of these conferences, John Looney invited 
me to speak on the right to dissent, the right to

03:34.040 --> 03:43.152
dissent for peace. The classical example was two 
years ago at Trinity Cathedral in downtown

03:44.774 --> 04:03.760
Cleveland, a beautiful Gothic Episcopalian 
cathedral where the main thing held, among the

03:44.774 --> 04:03.760
other things that the AFSC and Looney did, is they 
recognized that people don't drive 35 miles for a

03:44.774 --> 04:03.760
meeting. So each of these conferences were held 
simultaneously in Youngstown, Akron, and

04:04.735 --> 04:14.730
Cleveland, three separate conferences, and the 
speakers rotated. You'd speak in the morning in

04:14.750 --> 04:22.120
Youngstown, noon in Akron, the evening at 
Cleveland. So I'm speaking with Julian Bond and

04:22.140 --> 04:34.118
Marian Anderson at the beautiful, jam-packed 
cathedral, Episcopal Church, Trinity Cathedral

04:35.819 --> 04:39.224
in Cleveland. Marian Anderson from Flint, 
Michigan, I think, had spoken on the economic cost

04:39.244 --> 04:47.916
of nuclear war. She's the authority. She 
presented factual data showing that for every

04:49.539 --> 05:03.058
nuclear warhead built, the same amount of money 
put into domestic work could have produced 5,000

05:03.308 --> 05:06.532
new domestic jobs in Northeastern Ohio. Very 
telling argument there. Twelve, fifteen percent

05:09.255 --> 05:12.098
unemployment there. Then Julian spoke, and his 
argument was that for every dollar we pay in taxes,

05:13.200 --> 05:26.315
that fifty-seven cents on the dollar goes to pay 
for past or future wars. I was to be the third

05:27.557 --> 05:32.202
speaker on the right of dissent for peace. As I am 
about, Julia's is down, I'm walking up this

05:34.527 --> 05:48.823
marble, it's a huge cathedral, a big marble podium 
that you, up where the priest stands to speak. Huge

05:50.265 --> 05:52.087
thing. I'm up there. A woman at the far end of the 
cathedral stands up, no microphones, no nothing,

05:53.088 --> 06:04.180
and just hollers out, top of her voice, that, 
Senator Bond, everybody turns around to see what

06:04.396 --> 06:23.760
it was, she said, after what you and Marian 
Anderson have just said, I say, when tax day comes,

06:04.396 --> 06:23.760
let none of us pay 57 cents on a dollar for taxes, you 
know, for the war. And then, the lady, by the way,

06:25.202 --> 06:31.570
was a stereotype of a very middle-class bourgeois 
lady. She was tailored, tall, trim, flowery hat,

06:34.045 --> 06:50.181
and the accent, her accent was just the stereotype 
of what I think of as a high, high, high

06:34.045 --> 06:50.181
Episcopalian, the nearest thing there is to God, 
you know. Well, Julian, this woman then said, are

06:50.201 --> 06:54.585
you with me? She turned to the audience and walks up 
the aisle, cheering both sides of the nave, just

06:54.665 --> 07:01.892
the church roaring with cheering for her. Julian 
Bond finally gets the floor back. He says, my good

07:05.764 --> 07:10.870
lady, let me steal one on Frank. What you have just 
said is an advocacy of criminal conduct. Namely,

07:18.680 --> 07:21.323
don't pay taxes. As a result, the FBI and CIA agents 
who are legally in this cathedral tonight due to

07:21.343 --> 07:32.757
President Reagan's new guidelines from the CIA 
and the FBI, have taken due note of what you have

07:33.040 --> 07:39.228
said. And

07:39.248 --> 07:51.643
now we'll begin an investigation of you 
personally and the Social Action Committee of

07:39.248 --> 07:51.643
your church. Well, it's dead silence. What an 
introduction for you. Dead silence. But probably

08:02.858 --> 08:06.062
seemed like thirty seconds, about ten seconds. 
What Julian had done, and was carried across, and

08:06.082 --> 08:23.084
this would never have happened without the 
coalition building that they knew there in

08:06.082 --> 08:23.084
Cleveland, is that Julian had made the point of the 
indivisibility of the struggle for peace with the

08:06.082 --> 08:23.084
struggle for civil liberties. It's a long, long 
theory. I best answer questions like that by

08:28.291 --> 08:31.195
telling you. I think that lesson of Wisp in 1962, 
and this thing from Julian and Marian Anderson in

08:31.411 --> 08:42.183
1980, are the way we try to work. Always arguing 
that peace is indivisible, with civil rights are

08:42.703 --> 09:01.384
indivisible, with tying things together that we 
must have one coalition, and no matter what your

08:42.703 --> 09:01.384
social concern may be, you've got to include 
within that the civil liberties component. And

09:02.731 --> 09:05.434
that's a place where we have to stop now because
