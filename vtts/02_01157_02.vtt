I am Gerald Parker and I have been asked to reflect 
upon my background and my relation in the life of

00:01.516 --> 00:08.405
Dr. U.E. Marnie.

00:16.515 --> 00:23.143
I am Gerald Parker and I have been asked to reflect 
upon my background and my relation in the life of

00:16.515 --> 00:23.143
Dr. U.E. Marnie. Dr. Brown discussion of his life 
and habits is a hard act to follow. I was raised in

00:29.765 --> 00:35.773
Navarra County, which is located approximately 
50 miles southeast of Dallas. My family consisted

00:36.815 --> 00:40.620
of my mother, father, and three sons. I was the 
oldest. Our family made a living by dry land

00:43.424 --> 00:48.631
farming and ranching. I saved my family because we 
all had to work very hard just to make a living

00:48.651 --> 00:54.760
during the Depression. My mother and father were 
honest, God-fearing people, and they expected

00:55.752 --> 01:00.559
the same from their sons. About the time I was in the 
seventh grade, my dad accepted a position

01:01.780 --> 01:09.671
managing certain aspects of a farm and ranch owned 
by Mr. R.L. Wheelock, who made his money in the oil

01:09.691 --> 01:12.615
business. We lived three miles from the Powell 
High School, and if we didn't want to walk, we could

01:13.797 --> 01:20.005
run. While in high school, I worked with the field 
cattle and the horses at the ranch. At that time, I

01:27.282 --> 01:36.014
decided that if at all possible, I wanted to go to 
A&M, take animal husbandry and become a ranch

01:27.282 --> 01:36.014
foreman. Dr. Ray Dickerson from Dallas was the 
ranch veterinarian. When he made calls to the

01:40.240 --> 01:45.807
ranch, I always made sure that I could be on hand and 
assist him. When I finally made financial

01:47.149 --> 01:50.093
arrangements to go to A&M, Dr. Dickerson 
suggested I consider going to the veterinary

01:50.545 --> 01:54.389
school. Having much respect for Dr. Dickerson, I 
took his advice. My interest to A&M and enrollment

02:01.558 --> 02:08.385
in the School of Veterinary Medicine was one of the 
most exciting periods of my life. When I finished

02:09.507 --> 02:20.299
my sophomore year in the veterinary school and Dr. 
Ray Dickerson invited me to go to College Station

02:09.507 --> 02:20.299
with him and attend a TVMA meeting, I was 
delighted. At this meeting, I met Dr. U.E. Marnie,

02:23.604 --> 02:30.491
and he interviewed me for a summer job at his Alamo 
Dog and Cat Hospital in San Antonio, Texas.

02:31.872 --> 02:41.902
Probably the reason I got the job, I didn't ask him 
how much he paid, and I suspect that Dr. Dixon told

02:31.872 --> 02:41.902
him that I was not afraid of work. It was a very 
exciting summer for me because I gained a great

02:43.564 --> 02:48.068
deal of experience. I was paid $12 per week, and was 
furnished a bed in the hospital. And for the use of

02:55.016 --> 03:01.683
the bed, I was granted the privilege of answering 
the phone and doorbell during the night and on

02:55.016 --> 03:01.683
holidays. We had long hours, and we provided 
services and sold drugs to anyone on a 24-hour,

03:02.924 --> 03:10.732
365-day basis. Dr. Virgil Fondren was employed by 
Dr. Marnie at that time. Dr. Marnie did very little

03:17.539 --> 03:19.581
physical work, but he knew what was going on at all 
times, and everyone knew that he was the boss. I had

03:26.986 --> 03:34.096
a great deal of respect for his expertise in 
veterinary medicine and for his management

03:26.986 --> 03:34.096
skills. Dr. Marnie gave me a position with him 
after graduation. After finishing the state

03:38.523 --> 03:49.078
board examination late one cold, rainy January 
evening, I boarded the train and arrived in San

03:38.523 --> 03:49.078
Antonio, Texas about sunup the next morning. Dr. 
Marnie picked me up at the air depot and allowed me

03:50.307 --> 03:57.633
to put in a full day's work that day after a 
sleepless night. About two weeks later, I learned

03:59.715 --> 04:04.960
that I had passed the state board exam and my 
license was mailed to me. Since Dr. Brown has

04:06.541 --> 04:14.368
covered Dr. Marnie's life and habits, let me share 
a couple of humorous things we enjoyed about him.

04:15.629 --> 04:19.993
Dr. Marnie was almost bald-headed and he had a 
small tumor on the top of his head that was very

04:20.513 --> 04:21.815
noticeable. One morning, Dr. Marty came into the 
office wearing his usual attire. While he was in

04:28.344 --> 04:36.455
the adjoining room, a client, as I believe this 
person to be qualified though as a customer, came

04:28.344 --> 04:36.455
in. He said he wanted to talk to the old man. Since 
Dr. Fondren had a little age under his belt, I

04:40.902 --> 04:46.309
inquired which doctor he wanted to see. He stated 
that he wanted to see the old man with a grub in his

04:47.110 --> 04:50.335
head. After dealing with the customer, Doctor 
Marnie got dressed and left in his car. About two

04:57.281 --> 05:00.466
and a half hours later, he returned with a patch on 
his head. He never mentioned a word about having

05:01.387 --> 05:08.397
the tumor removed, and it goes without saying it 
was never mentioned by anyone else. Another time.

05:11.321 --> 05:17.029
Everyone was occupied and a client wanted a rabies 
vaccination for their dog. They were in a hurry and

05:18.190 --> 05:20.153
was about to leave. Dr. Marty, not wanting to lose a 
dollar vaccination, decided to perform the test

05:20.723 --> 05:25.828
himself. Instead of putting a needle on the 
syringe from the sterilizer, he picked up a

05:26.849 --> 05:34.477
blunt-ended Tomcat catheter. His vision wasn't 
too good at that time. When I got into the exam room

05:39.342 --> 05:46.950
to relieve him, he was still trying to push that 
blunt-ended Tomcat catheter through the skin of

05:39.342 --> 05:46.950
that dog. Needless to say, the Tom Gatt catheter 
was never placed in with the needles again. Dr.

05:54.533 --> 06:00.483
Marty demanded that everyone, clients, 
employees, and even his wife show respect for his

05:54.533 --> 06:00.483
veterinarians. He paid good salaries for that day 
and time, and he expected loyalty and hard work in

06:01.264 --> 06:06.712
return. He insisted that his employed 
veterinarians become active in organized

06:07.794 --> 06:12.501
veterinary medicine. He had gone through all the 
chairs himself. In October of 1943, I left the

06:17.018 --> 06:22.786
employment of Dr. Marnie and became employed by 
the United States Army. R.A. Culpepper became my

06:23.987 --> 06:25.930
replacement. In closing, let me tell you that Dr. 
Marnie had a great deal of influence on my life,

06:27.853 --> 06:38.968
especially in pursuing an active role in 
organized veterinary medicine. I have had over 40

06:39.208 --> 06:45.296
wonderful years of being an associate and partner 
to R.D. Brown, And I hope to get to put up with him

06:46.280 --> 06:50.745
many more. Since Dr. Marnie was responsible for 
bringing us together, he would be very proud to

06:50.765 --> 06:59.555
know that our relationship has lasted this long. 
Thank you. Our relationship has lasted this long.

07:08.124 --> 07:08.625
Thank you.

20:04.973 --> 20:05.974
Now it does, see. And it's running. And so you want 
it to pause. Punch it again. It starts again. And

20:18.070 --> 20:22.576
now you want to... I want to erase. Okay, you want to 
erase. Then you have to punch stop, eject.
