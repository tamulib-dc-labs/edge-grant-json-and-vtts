00:11.405 --> 00:19.457
This

00:11.405 --> 00:19.457
is true. That happens very regularly. It does with 
anthropologists, too. When you're working with

00:24.604 --> 00:35.860
informants, you get a guy who's just great, you 
know, and spouting stuff this way and the other

00:24.604 --> 00:35.860
way, and you switch on the tape recorder, and all of 
a sudden you begin to get these awful stills Which I

00:36.667 --> 00:40.531
will shortly demonstrate. I know you, from your 
letters, which you might want to forget, but I know

00:40.551 --> 00:55.325
you were in Cincinnati for a while, perhaps grew up 
there, but if you'd just briefly run down your

00:40.551 --> 00:55.325
early history until, say, you got up to UT, it would 
help out a good deal, I think. Well, first of all,

00:55.345 --> 01:06.235
maybe I ought to say this, that I don't really want 
to forget those letters. they they're kind of

01:07.160 --> 01:35.091
embarrassing to go back and read now but after all 
you know you you can't be held responsible for

01:07.160 --> 01:35.091
everything you said when you were 14 years old but 
they meant a great deal to me at one period in my life

01:07.160 --> 01:35.091
because i was a kid i was i was nuts about sports and 
things of that kind i was very active up until i got

01:07.160 --> 01:35.091
rheumatic fever when i was a child And I was very 
sick, and I was sick for a long time. And all I had

01:39.672 --> 01:41.494
were books. I used to lie up in my bed in a second 
story house and look out the window and see all

01:41.514 --> 01:48.702
these kids going down to play ball and everything. 
And I couldn't go with them. All I had were the books

01:50.724 --> 01:53.627
and the magazines and these letters that I wrote. 
And I can remember just the desperate anxiety of

01:54.708 --> 02:03.998
waiting for that magazine to come out and find out, 
had your letter appeared in print? And it just made

02:04.265 --> 02:06.309
my day. And I really think it would be pretty 
ungrateful to go back now and say, well, it's just a

02:06.329 --> 02:13.505
mistake of my youth and all that. Because silly as 
they were, they were in court. Well, this isn't

02:16.250 --> 02:18.195
answering the question. I never answered 
questions. Let's see.

02:24.413 --> 02:26.315
You were in Cincinnati when you started writing 
letters. Well, I was born. Maybe we can begin

02:28.338 --> 02:32.023
there.

02:32.964 --> 02:37.871
I was born in Cincinnati on the 30th of March in 
1928.

02:41.455 --> 02:43.678
My father was a doctor, a surgeon. My mother had 
been a nurse. She met my father when she was a nurse,

02:46.842 --> 02:54.252
he was a doctor, and the full process of time I 
appeared.

02:55.615 --> 03:00.962
I was still living in Cincinnati at the time I first 
discovered science fiction. Actually, I had

03:01.022 --> 03:08.091
discovered it, if that's the word, and read it long 
before I knew what it was. I read Jules Verne, I can

03:10.334 --> 03:18.244
remember, along about the fourth grade, 
something of that sort, and thought it was great.

03:18.364 --> 03:21.068
And then I hit H.G. Wells. Actually, the way I got to 
reading science fiction, per se, was I was at

03:23.358 --> 03:32.870
Burroughs, and I'd read everything that Edgar 
Rice Burroughs ever wrote, I think. I

03:34.171 --> 03:36.634
particularly was knocked out by the Martian 
stories. I guess everybody would. I often

03:38.697 --> 03:40.980
thought, you know, I think everybody did the same 
thing. You know, you read A Princess of Mars, and

03:41.020 --> 03:46.587
that wonderful technique by which he gets to Mars. 
You know, he just goes out and looks yearningly up

03:46.607 --> 03:51.593
there at the red planet, and there he is. I'm sure 
every kid that ever read Burroughs tried that.

03:55.656 --> 03:59.260
I've often thought how, what an utter disaster it 
would have been if it worked. You know, and you

04:00.081 --> 04:10.070
suddenly woke up, you know, weak, pimply, 
13-year-old boy, you know, standing there on

04:00.081 --> 04:10.070
Mars, you know, surrounded by all these God-awful 
things. But anyway, I read a lot of Burroughs, and

04:10.090 --> 04:16.737
got a letter from him one time, by the way. He was 
kind enough to answer a letter that I wrote. And I

04:20.986 --> 04:23.911
went to a newsstand one time. I don't know how much 
tape you got on this thing. Oh, I've got plenty.

04:27.658 --> 04:28.339
You've got plenty. I'm going to flip it here in a 
minute. Well, let me just back up a little bit. I was

04:33.549 --> 04:35.252
always an omnivorous reader. And chiefly in those 
days, what I was reading, aside from every book I

04:36.454 --> 04:42.685
could get my hands on, were pulp magazines. And I 
read them all. Well, not all of them, but most of

04:44.763 --> 04:47.086
them. And I subscribed to G8 and his Battle Aces and 
Daredevil Aces and The Spider and The Shadow and

04:47.147 --> 04:56.541
Doc Savage and all this stuff. My pet was G8. And, 
you know, looking back now, I can see why. Because

05:01.087 --> 05:05.854
if you've ever read, you've never read G8 and his 
Battle Aces by Robert J. Hogan. Well, they were

05:07.016 --> 05:07.837
terrific. They had a wild Baroque. imagination to 
them, and they're really science fiction

05:10.565 --> 05:15.449
stories, but they weren't presented that way. 
Anyway, one time I went to the newsstand and I saw

05:16.010 --> 05:22.455
one of those big fat old Amazings, and I don't 
remember the date.

05:27.659 --> 05:40.470
Well, I don't remember what it was, but it had a 
Burroughs story in it that was listed on the cover,

05:27.659 --> 05:40.470
and I picked it up to read the Burroughs story, and 
then I made the fatal mistake of reading the rest of

05:27.659 --> 05:40.470
the magazine. And I remember in that issue they had 
a Neander Bender story in it. Adam Link Saves the

05:44.602 --> 05:48.808
World, I think was the title of it. And a great short 
novel by Edmund Hamilton called Treasure on

05:48.828 --> 05:58.300
Thunder Moon, which I thought at the time was 
doubtless the finest piece of literature I'd ever

05:48.828 --> 05:58.300
read. Anyway, I was just completely hooked. And 
that's how it happened. I really did the kind of

06:03.466 --> 06:06.610
junk that I described in the letter. you know, 
hopping on the bicycle and barreling back to the

06:07.248 --> 06:13.575
newsstand and buying everything that had 
anything to do with science fiction. It really

06:13.595 --> 06:14.256
happened. It happened every month.

06:18.301 --> 06:32.057
So, anyway, there I was in Cincinnati, and the way I 
got out of Cincinnati was during the war, as I said,

06:18.301 --> 06:32.057
my father was a doctor, and he enlisted, and they 
sent him to Crystal City, Texas. as medical

06:32.678 --> 06:36.602
officer in charge of what they called an alien 
detention camp. There was an internment camp for

06:36.622 --> 06:39.544
Japanese and Germans. And needless to say, he took 
the family with me, with him. And when I got to

06:45.650 --> 06:49.113
Crystal City, I was a sophomore in high school. It 
was the end of my sophomore year in high school. And

06:51.895 --> 06:56.360
so that gets me out of Cincinnati and into Texas. 
Now where do you want me to go from there? You ended

06:58.301 --> 07:02.365
up in Kerrville, then. I stayed with my family in 
Crystal City through my junior year in high

07:02.564 --> 07:08.892
school. That must have been 44, that sounds right. 
Then my father was transferred to Galveston to the

07:14.079 --> 07:28.538
Marine Hospital, and I stayed in Crystal City 
after the family left and rented a room there and

07:14.079 --> 07:28.538
stayed, because every time I moved I got 
ineligible to play football. And football was the

07:28.703 --> 07:32.830
big thing in my life. I wasn't about to miss my 
senior year, so I stayed there another year. Then

07:38.139 --> 07:49.457
after I graduated in August 45, I came to the 
university, but my family was living in

07:38.139 --> 07:49.457
Galveston. And then we left Galveston, my family 
left Galveston. Oh boy. long about my junior year

07:55.788 --> 07:58.292
in college. Sorry, I don't know what date that 
would be. As I say, I'm miserable on dates. I went to

08:04.000 --> 08:04.821
Kerrville. Daddy went to work for the Veterans 
Hospital in Kerrville, you know, the

08:04.841 --> 08:12.612
tuberculosis hospital. And so that's how I got to 
Kerrville. My mother's still there. My father's

08:16.718 --> 08:17.539
dead. And I guess that about covers it as far as 
formal places to live. picked up at UT as a freshman

08:25.252 --> 08:29.457
when you started your college at Gibbs. Yeah, I 
went through Plan 2 here at the university and got

08:29.837 --> 08:35.484
my BA in Plan 2. My English professor my freshman 
year was Harry Ranson, which shows how old I am, and

08:37.626 --> 08:47.718
a marvelous teacher, by the way. And I think, if I'm 
not mistaken, I was the only The only boy in the

08:51.914 --> 08:56.539
graduating class from Crystal City High School 
that went to the University of Texas. Everybody

08:56.599 --> 08:59.021
else went to A&M. So I was the maverick in the group. 
And I got my BA here in Plan 2, which, as you may know,

09:02.865 --> 09:07.009
doesn't have a major. And I got my MA here with a 
major in English and a minor in anthropology. I

09:12.634 --> 09:15.417
wrote my MA thesis on science fiction. Then I went 
to UCLA and took my PhD in anthropology. Did you

09:19.403 --> 09:22.847
start out as an anthropology major on the master's 
level? There were mentions, I think, in the

09:22.867 --> 09:27.013
letters that you were shooting in that direction. 
No, not really. The way it worked was that I'd

09:28.575 --> 09:34.122
really, I'd always been interested in 
anthropology. I got interested in it from science

09:34.442 --> 09:44.635
fiction, and as you probably know, a great deal of 
science fiction deals with what really is a

09:44.935 --> 09:50.622
conflict between cultures of one sort or another, 
even, you know, so you set it on Saturn, it's still

09:44.935 --> 09:50.622
the same deal. So, and I was always interested in 
that. When I got to university, my freshman year, I

09:53.186 --> 10:13.272
took a couple of courses in anthropology, and I, 
uh, I liked it, you know, liked it a lot, but I wasn't

09:53.186 --> 10:13.272
really hooked or anything, and I didn't take any 
more anthropology until my senior year, and a

09:53.186 --> 10:13.272
number of people had told me that There was a 
professor on the campus that I really ought to take

10:13.657 --> 10:18.304
a course from before I left the university. This 
was McAllister. And I did. I took it really to take

10:20.989 --> 10:25.556
McAllister, not to take anthropology. And he was 
just one of these fabulous teachers, you know. And

10:30.744 --> 10:33.589
really, from that time on, I was in anthropology. 
But I was so committed for a variety of reasons, one

10:34.379 --> 10:45.290
reason I had so many hours, to English, that I went 
ahead and took my MA in English at the same time I was

10:34.379 --> 10:45.290
taking graduate work in anthropology. And I 
actually taught English here for a while at

10:46.151 --> 10:49.874
Ransoms and Systems. But I knew that wasn't what I 
wanted to do. I found myself in my English classes

10:53.038 --> 10:59.244
talking about Cheyenne and Comanche and . So I went 
to UCLA and took the PhD. You had a pretty good

11:04.163 --> 11:08.267
variety of jobs while you were a student here, 
didn't you? No, not really. Didn't you have a radio

11:10.129 --> 11:11.750
program for a while? Yeah, but that was later. If my 
chronology isn't hopelessly off, it was after

11:13.933 --> 11:21.960
1955 when I came back here to teach anthropology. I 
hadn't finished my PhD, but I had everything but

11:22.881 --> 11:27.826
the dissertation. And it was sometime after that 
that I got roped into doing that disc jockey show on

11:33.391 --> 11:36.334
KHFI. And we did it for a couple of years, as I 
recall, right up until the time, I think, that I

11:37.115 --> 11:48.028
left to go back to the University of California at 
Riverside to teach for a year. But apart from that,

11:50.471 --> 11:54.936
there really wasn't much of anything. Did you ever 
work for the American Statesman? No. Just

11:58.560 --> 12:00.883
thinking from the reporter. No, I've written a 
couple of articles for them from time to time, but I

12:01.319 --> 12:11.170
never worked for them. And really, as far as actual 
jobs are concerned, there's been almost nothing.

12:16.236 --> 12:26.328
There was a period in Cincinnati, actually, where 
I worked for a record store, but not a long time ago.

12:26.348 --> 12:28.750
That's pretty well covered that aspect of it. 
Yeah, not that there's much to cover. This type of

12:31.795 --> 12:34.860
article, I don't need much depth. Or if I find I need 
it, I'll have to look back at you by letter. Okay.

12:43.132 --> 12:46.417
You started publishing when you were an 
undergraduate student here? Is that right? That

12:50.863 --> 12:52.065
sounds about right. I know one of the letters is 
from your roommate at the time. Really?

12:56.551 --> 12:59.656
Commenting on a published story of yours. He 
commented, It's a great story now, this. It's

13:02.868 --> 13:04.751
immaterial of Chaz behind me with a gun. Isn't that 
funny? I have no memory of that at all. Who was it? Do

13:10.478 --> 13:11.660
you remember Tom Toney? I don't remember the name. 
So it must have been. So apparently you must have

13:17.727 --> 13:24.035
started when you... Well, actually, I started 
long before that. That is, started writing. It

13:27.780 --> 13:30.844
started before I ever left Cincinnati. And I 
conned my folks into buying me a used Remington.

13:38.078 --> 13:39.480
And I taught myself to type. This is when I was so 
practically bedridden. And I ground out all sorts

13:44.547 --> 13:52.738
of masterpieces and sent them in to a variety of 
editors. And I'll never forget how kind most of

13:53.559 --> 13:58.165
them were. You know, considering the quality of 
what I was doubtless sending them, they must have

13:58.448 --> 14:02.974
been pretty terrible. And almost from the very 
beginning, I must have been about 14 when I began

14:04.016 --> 14:14.811
doing this, I hardly ever got just a form of 
rejection slip. They'd always write me letters

14:14.831 --> 14:19.037
and say, this shows a lot of promise. Keep trying. 
Do this, that, or the other. And

14:21.681 --> 14:26.868
it's something that meant a great deal to me. And I 
kept it up. All the time I was in Crystal City.

14:31.702 --> 14:35.849
Despite my addiction to football and one thing and 
another, I wrote all the time. Not prodigiously,

14:36.790 --> 14:39.835
but I was always writing something. And so when I 
finally did connect, it wasn't a deal where I just

14:40.716 --> 14:47.967
sat down one day and wrote a story and somebody 
bought it. Tony Boucher, actually. But just that I

14:50.431 --> 14:54.898
had been writing ever since I was about 14 years 
old. And to come back to your question, you know, I

14:55.891 --> 15:06.608
guess I must have been, I'm certain I was, because I 
know it was after we moved to Kerrville that I sold

14:55.891 --> 15:06.608
that first story, and I'll never forget it. It was a 
story you probably are familiar with since you've

15:07.930 --> 15:13.678
researched me so thoroughly. The Boy Next Door 
actually was a story that I wrote for Weird Tales

15:14.780 --> 15:21.831
and sent it to Weird Tales, and this was, you know, 
toward the end of Weird Tales' existence, when

15:22.047 --> 15:27.134
they were not exactly doing what you'd call 
creative editing. And I never got any response

15:27.154 --> 15:30.678
from them at all, just the manuscript back in the 
mail. The magazine of fantasy and science fiction

15:31.820 --> 15:37.067
had just started up, and I'd read it and thought, 
boy, this is terrific. Here's a guy that will

15:37.107 --> 15:40.051
probably appreciate my tremendous genius. And he 
did. You know, I was just floored. When I got the

15:45.065 --> 15:59.223
letter, I can still remember it almost word for 
word, and the gist of it was he was apologizing

15:45.065 --> 15:59.223
because he could only pay $100 for it, and would 
that be satisfactory, and that they were having

15:45.065 --> 15:59.223
some financial trouble, so they couldn't pay 
right away. I might have to wait a month or two, and

15:59.264 --> 16:03.509
you know, God, I'd have given them the story. I'd 
have paid them. to buy it, but yeah, that's when it

16:05.467 --> 16:08.791
started. That's good. That picked up a lot there. 
I'm not mistaken, the introduction to The Boy Next

16:12.235 --> 16:18.943
Door mentions that this was the first one sold with 
the actual publication. That's right. Another

16:19.583 --> 16:20.705
story came first. That's right. After Tony 
bought, actually I should say McComas and Tony

16:21.786 --> 16:31.457
bought The Boy Next Door, I sold a story to Super 
Science. And the editor, if I'm not mistaken, was a

16:32.382 --> 16:35.506
man named Jacobson. I think it's the same guy 
that's editing Galaxy now who's come back out of

16:36.348 --> 16:41.294
whatever limbo he was in. And he brought a story 
called The Land of the Lost Content, which

16:42.316 --> 16:50.888
actually was published before The Boy Next Door, 
but it was written after that. That's

16:50.908 --> 16:51.569
interesting. It was that Jacobson. Yeah, it is. 
He's done some interesting things with Galaxy.

16:57.337 --> 16:58.258
Yeah, I'm sure he has. I've just thumbed through 
it. What's he done? He's gone experimental for one

17:03.112 --> 17:04.975
time. Meaning? The new wave, the so-called new 
wave thing that you hear about, which leads

17:06.316 --> 17:13.626
logically to the next question. Have you read much 
in the recent literature, and have you got any

17:13.686 --> 17:22.098
opinions on this new wave, quote, new wave, 
unquote? Which I'm not sure what it is, frankly.

17:26.644 --> 17:32.612
Well,

17:26.644 --> 17:32.612
first of all, I don't read science fiction. any 
kind of science fiction as much as I used to because

17:32.862 --> 17:37.007
I just can't. I don't have the time. It doesn't 
bleed me. It's not that I've lost interest. It's

17:42.673 --> 18:00.473
just that I have so little time to read that I have to 
be fairly selective and therefore I don't feel

17:42.673 --> 18:00.473
that I'm as familiar with it as I ought to be to make 
some kind of halfway sane comment and I certainly

17:42.673 --> 18:00.473
don't want to run down any writer that I really have 
not read. On the other hand, I don't want to just

18:04.531 --> 18:08.175
dodge the question either. Yeah, I've read some of 
it that I think could be classified as New Wave,

18:08.215 --> 18:20.830
Harlan Ellison, Spinrad, Delaney,

18:08.215 --> 18:20.830
who else? There's somebody else that pops in that I 
recall reading, well I guess

18:31.098 --> 18:35.703
Zalazny is sometimes classified in a new way. I 
don't know exactly what to say about it. I was

18:37.445 --> 19:00.071
amazed when I talked to Harlan Ellison when he came 
down and asked me for this story, but he more or less

18:37.445 --> 19:00.071
considered me part of the new way in the sense that a 
lot of the stuff that I was writing at the time that I

18:37.445 --> 19:00.071
wrote it was very non-traditional, including 
Shadows in the Sun, for example.

19:00.091 --> 19:00.852
I guess the The most honest thing I could say about 
it is that I've read some of it that I admire very

19:01.085 --> 19:06.972
much. I think Bug Jack Baron, for example, is a damn 
interesting book. And I understand what it is that

19:15.603 --> 19:20.209
they're trying to do. The problem, from my point of 
view, is that it's just not on my wavelength. quite

19:28.642 --> 19:29.964
know how else to put it. I don't resent it. I think 
it's a healthy trend as long as it doesn't crowd out

19:32.207 --> 19:36.553
every other type of writing. I think you could be 
corny and say that Mr. Gernsback's mansion has

19:37.434 --> 19:47.788
many rooms, and I can't see why one or two of them 
couldn't be new with, for want of a better term. You

19:47.808 --> 19:50.011
can't be static. You can't stand still. And I don't 
care how traditionalist you may think you are, you

19:51.946 --> 20:02.965
know, none of us wants to go back and write like Ray 
Cummings or Otis Adelbert Klein or somebody, or

19:51.946 --> 20:02.965
even Edgar Rice Burroughs, for that matter. And 
it's really just a question of what direction are

20:03.626 --> 20:13.583
you going to move, and how much of what's been built 
up are you going to throw away? I don't know if this

20:14.120 --> 20:22.754
makes any sense or not, but see, I come from the 
school, in broader terms, I think literature took

20:14.120 --> 20:22.754
a wrong turning with James Joyce. And my, not that I 
don't admire Ulysses, I think it's a fascinating

20:23.976 --> 20:32.930
book, but I think it did more harm than good in the 
long run. And my own preferences, I like novelists

20:33.731 --> 20:41.443
like Joseph Conrad, I like the early Hemingway, 
things like The Sun Also Rises, and short stories

20:41.693 --> 20:52.087
like The Two-Hearted River, and things like that, 
partly because I'm a trout fishing nut, and you can

20:41.693 --> 20:52.087
see this book on the fly is that your microphone is 
sitting there. And Steinbeck, despite all the

20:53.388 --> 21:03.702
criticism that's been leveled, I like a more 
traditionally based novel. And I am, I fear,

21:04.525 --> 21:10.471
reactionary enough to still like stories with a 
beginning, a middle, and an end. I don't know. I

21:13.673 --> 21:23.002
remember I took an English course years ago in 
which the textbook was something called

21:13.673 --> 21:23.002
Tradition and Direction in the Modern Short 
Story. And they began with four short stories,

21:23.162 --> 21:28.367
traditional stories, as examples of what not to 
do. And I recall I liked all four of them better than

21:29.308 --> 21:33.672
anything else in the book.

21:36.166 --> 21:45.339
But I would emphasize that I don't think it's a 
horrible development or anything of that kind.

21:45.379 --> 21:50.626
It's quite obviously tied up with lots of broader 
changes in this culture and in writing in general.

21:51.748 --> 21:58.177
And it's small wonder that so many of the younger 
writers are moving in that direction. I think

21:58.197 --> 22:01.161
there's going to be a swing back the other way, 
eventually. And I still, you know, given my

22:01.867 --> 22:13.080
druthers, I'd rather read Paul Anderson, but just 
the same, I like what they're doing.

22:13.100 --> 22:14.602
First book, Mists of Dawn. Were you contacted 
about this topic or did you orient it toward the

22:16.544 --> 22:21.509
youth market yourself? No, uh, Mists of Dawn was 
written, uh,

22:29.812 --> 22:58.941
shortly after I signed with my first agent, who was 
Scott Meredith, and Meredith had this contract

22:29.812 --> 22:58.941
with the Winston Company for a series of 
teenage-oriented, juvenile, whatever you want

22:29.812 --> 22:58.941
to call them, science fiction novels, and he asked 
me to write one, and asked me to write him an outline

22:29.812 --> 22:58.941
and a sample chapter, which I did, and that's how 
that thing was written. the reviewers tended to

23:00.406 --> 23:08.176
criticize Mr. Dunn because of your 
characterization of the Neon development more

23:00.406 --> 23:08.176
than anything else. They did. That I don't 
remember. It was interesting, given your

23:11.080 --> 23:20.051
anthropology, interesting background as to why 
you might have picked out this particular

23:11.080 --> 23:20.051
characterization. To be honest, I don't 
remember. It was a long time ago, and I don't

23:26.219 --> 23:28.742
remember whether the specific topic was assigned 
to me or whether I picked it. I don't know. And I

23:35.513 --> 23:38.396
don't remember what the criticism was. It got some 
good reviews. It got good reviews. In fact, the

23:41.420 --> 23:49.991
only negative point, generally, was this thing 
that Neanderthal wasn't... There was no proof

23:50.051 --> 23:53.215
that he was the nasty old ogre that was in this 
picture. Well, that's a fair criticism. You can

23:55.218 --> 23:56.299
respond to it. by saying that there wasn't any 
proof that he wasn't either. Yeah, that's true.

23:59.957 --> 24:02.280
And who knows? But, you know, it's really not a 
factual error. Not that I think factual errors are

24:10.293 --> 24:13.438
all that important. It's a matter of case 
interpretation, and I think it's very definitely

24:14.339 --> 24:23.333
tied in with a number of other currents No, there 
aren't any fashionable villains anymore. You

24:28.380 --> 24:33.745
can't make an Indian a villain, you can't do this, 
you can't do that, and I guess you can't make a

24:28.380 --> 24:33.745
Neanderthal a villain either. And I don't know, 
maybe all of those are too harsh. It's probably a

24:38.189 --> 24:39.831
fair criticism. There's also been a lot of 
discussion to the effect that the conflict, if

24:39.871 --> 24:52.864
there was one, between the Homo sapiens and the 
Neanderthals, and you see at the time I wrote this

24:39.871 --> 24:52.864
book, they were considered to be rather more 
different than they are now. That's probably what

24:55.069 --> 24:56.991
I'm going to say in your defense. Yeah, they're 
both placed in genus Homo now, you know, with just

24:57.111 --> 25:01.876
separate species, presumably. Prior to that, 
though, they were regarded as quite distinct. And

25:07.741 --> 25:18.632
generally, the change has been that in the old 
days, there was this feeling there was kind of a

25:07.741 --> 25:18.632
knock-down, drag-out fight between the sapiens 
and the Neanderthals. And apparently it probably

25:19.439 --> 25:22.362
wasn't that way. It was more a matter of occupying 
the same ecological niche and one being more

25:22.402 --> 25:27.867
efficient than the other. But you go back and read 
Missing Dawn, which I confess I have not done in a

25:28.428 --> 25:46.105
number of years, but I did only recall including 
some rather sympathetic passages about the

25:28.428 --> 25:46.105
Neanderthals too, including one that had 
something to do with a Neanderthal child. And

25:46.793 --> 26:02.536
you've got to remember that the protagonist, the 
Missadon, is a young kid who suddenly finds

25:46.793 --> 26:02.536
himself back there, and chances are if Joe 
Neanderthal came walking through the door now, we

25:46.793 --> 26:02.536
would regard him with at least some trepidation. 
Yes. But it's a fair criticism. I wouldn't object

26:06.502 --> 26:08.645
to that. It's not nearly as annoying as some of the 
criticisms I've received, my favorite being from

26:08.665 --> 26:13.712
Kingsley Amos. who criticized Shadows in the Sun, 
a great one, because he said, in effect, he thought

26:14.907 --> 26:25.580
it was a good book and all this, but the protagonist 
was utterly unbelievable, a six-foot-three

26:14.907 --> 26:25.580
anthropologist who lived in Texas. I was guilty, 
as authors often are, of writing about myself, and

26:26.721 --> 26:38.676
I submit that I'm lots of things, but I'm not 
unbelievable. That's curious. Yeah. Dick had

26:42.785 --> 26:48.614
mentioned several things that appeared possibly 
autobiographical in that book. What, in Shadows

26:48.714 --> 26:49.856
in the Sun? In the characters. I don't know how much 
of the character actually is autobiographical,

26:51.418 --> 27:02.736
except for the... You know, if you happen to be a big 
man, it's easier to write about a big man, because

26:51.418 --> 27:02.736
that's what you've been all your life. And, you 
know, he smokes pipe and things of this kind,

27:03.357 --> 27:07.223
but... I guess there are other incidents in there 
that are autobiographical, too. I don't even

27:12.747 --> 27:16.252
remember at this point. This gets into the area of 
reading into a book many things that often weren't

27:16.432 --> 27:29.230
put there by the author, at least on a conscious 
level, which is one thing I wanted to try to avoid

27:16.432 --> 27:29.230
doing if I could. I don't have the talent for it. 
Well, you never know. We talked about The Boy Next

27:33.656 --> 27:35.359
Door. I don't know if you remember the story that 
clearly or not. in effect, you know, it's modeled

27:39.738 --> 28:00.471
on an experience that I had as a child, where they 
had a radio program in Cincinnati, where every so

27:39.738 --> 28:00.471
often, if you accumulated enough coupons or 
whatever it was, you'd go down there and be

27:39.738 --> 28:00.471
interviewed on the air, and I was so turned off by 
all these saccharine interviews, you know, what

27:39.738 --> 28:00.471
have you been doing all week, Jimmy? Yeah, I've 
been playing with my dog, and this, that, you know,

28:03.397 --> 28:08.426
You know, I thought it would be fun to get a 
character who came in and really said something

28:03.397 --> 28:08.426
like, why all that? I've been killing people. But 
anyway, the character was named Jimmy Walls, and

28:10.310 --> 28:14.879
Jim Walls is my oldest friend. He and I went through 
high school together, and he still lives here in

28:15.740 --> 28:19.227
Austin. He runs a pier out here, I don't know if 
you're familiar with it, out on the lake. And his

28:23.655 --> 28:26.721
mother got a hold of that story. And she 
interpreted this to mean, you know, that I was

28:27.359 --> 28:41.194
really, literally saying that Jimmy Walls went 
out and killed people, and she went around to all

28:27.359 --> 28:41.194
the newsstands and bought copies and burned them 
and things of this kind, and just took it all dead

28:27.359 --> 28:41.194
seriously. And so have a number of critics, by the 
way, talking about the profound point I was trying

28:41.794 --> 28:48.662
to make about the nature of this society and all 
that. I mean, I was just having fun. Well, excuse

28:51.865 --> 28:53.066
me. I got the tone you were speaking of when I read 
the story. much as watching the good old Uncle Jay

28:56.249 --> 29:02.557
show and waiting for the kids to come up and just lay 
one on them.

29:06.262 --> 29:11.329
There's probably more that is autobiographical 
in Shadows in the Sun than in anything else. After

29:12.390 --> 29:15.454
all, it's about Crystal City, and I was there. It's 
a geographical location. What, did I move it? Oh,

29:19.640 --> 29:20.020
yes. 180 degrees the opposite direction. I didn't 
remember. You put it out. to the west where you look

29:25.375 --> 29:28.599
at a map and there's nothing. Not even a highway. 
That was clever. I did the same thing in the shores

29:31.223 --> 29:33.827
of another city. Actually, I located it 
correctly, but I changed place names around so

29:35.589 --> 29:44.261
that if you actually went to whatever I called it in 
the book, you wouldn't find it there. Mittaboni, I

29:44.862 --> 29:50.089
think I said it was in, and Mittaboni's cleaning 
the other end of Ucumban. And I just did it, too. I

29:51.110 --> 29:52.412
don't know why I did it. No, not really. I guess it's 
a device that's intended to indicate, look, this

29:55.790 --> 30:03.261
is based on a real place, but I don't really mean 
that when there are changes. Yeah. It's not

30:05.384 --> 30:07.307
literal. Yeah. There weren't any aliens in 
Crystal City. Except me, darn. I was the alien

30:17.381 --> 30:18.884
Yankee. Hal and I have commented a couple of times 
on the odds of any other pair of cities such as

30:23.729 --> 30:32.487
Carrizo Springs and Crystal City producing two 
Doctores of Anthropology? Well, you talk about a

30:32.547 --> 30:41.886
fantastic coincidence department, you can 
extend it, but that the two of us would both be at the

30:32.547 --> 30:41.886
Biboonery and keep the odds. That's true. both 
having taken the same, or taking degrees at UT.

30:50.313 --> 30:51.635
Just a whole chain. Except the Claude went to 
Berkeley, and I went to UC Berkeley. Ended up in the

30:57.043 --> 30:58.265
same stadium. It's highly unlikely, to put it in 
that way. Curiosity, which of your, maybe you've

31:02.772 --> 31:09.902
already answered this in print, pilgrimage is 
apparently one of your favorite stories from what

31:10.945 --> 31:15.371
you said in Butcher and Boucher. It's Boucher, or 
at least that's what he called it. Oh, okay,

31:18.154 --> 31:19.096
Boucher. Well, that's good to know. Not his real 
name, you know. But I like to pronounce things

31:24.803 --> 31:27.226
correctly when I can. Well, I guess if you 
pronounce it correctly, it'd be Boucher. Excuse

31:31.471 --> 31:32.693
me. Someone butchers your first name terribly 
over at A&M, and I was trying to remember what they

31:33.494 --> 31:38.100
called you. My

31:38.907 --> 31:50.925
first letter that came out in print was before I had 
this typewriter that was handwritten and nobody

31:38.907 --> 31:50.925
remarked on it.
