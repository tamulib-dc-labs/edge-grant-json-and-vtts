WEBVTT

00:04.823 --> 00:23.702
According to him, the

00:04.823 --> 00:23.702
curriculum was now, quote, too modern,

00:04.823 --> 00:23.702
with not enough attention to algebra

00:04.823 --> 00:23.702
and the skillful use of slide rules.

00:28.367 --> 00:33.953
As he proceeded to talk about what his generation 
had used and needed,

00:35.755 --> 00:53.231
the youngsters began to shake their heads in 
disbelief because it was obvious that there was a

00:35.755 --> 00:53.231
generational gap between his thoughts and their 
aspirations.

00:57.435 --> 01:05.543
Soon he called for the president of the senior 
class to go with him to speak in opposition to the

01:07.008 --> 01:16.839
RISL recommendations.

01:22.325 --> 01:36.981
That young man stood up

01:22.325 --> 01:36.981
and responded

01:22.325 --> 01:36.981
to the old timer that because the senior class had 
not discussed these matters Neither he as class

01:39.121 --> 01:46.571
president nor any other individual could speak, 
quote, for the senior class. In fact, he himself

01:48.634 --> 01:54.522
favored at least some of the changes, if not all.

01:58.748 --> 02:08.622
Thus, the session ended, and the students walked 
away, sure, feeling confident, that this

02:09.344 --> 02:19.376
gentleman

02:09.344 --> 02:19.376
was a bit out of touch

02:09.344 --> 02:19.376
with the current era.

02:23.001 --> 02:36.718
Meanwhile, the former student leadership had 
moved quickly to lend their efforts to the

02:23.001 --> 02:36.718
recommendations.

02:36.738 --> 02:39.081
Lindsay, Hervey, Wiris, all In agreement. About 
the need about. The positive. Potential positive

02:48.834 --> 02:50.276
results. Other recommended changes.

02:56.646 --> 02:57.407
Joined in a. Minor revision. To the agenda. For 
their officers gathering.

03:09.384 --> 03:11.447
They added a final. topic, quote, other business,

03:12.102 --> 03:21.171
quote, to the listing of discussion matters.

03:24.354 --> 03:37.907
Thus, as the meeting neared its conclusion

03:24.354 --> 03:37.907
and the men who had traveled from a wide variety of 
towns began to gather their bags, President

03:38.866 --> 03:47.454
Lindsay said, oh, something to the effect, oh, 
there is one other item, other business. Here is

03:47.834 --> 03:49.876
the background recommendations. Do I hear any 
discussion? Yes, there is a motion and a second. No

03:55.602 --> 03:56.342
discussion. All in favor say aye. There are no 
nays. Meeting adjourned. As a few in the group

04:02.708 --> 04:05.751
tried to express their opposition, Lindsay, 
Wyrus, and Hervey hurried down the hallway and

04:07.030 --> 04:34.708
handed Board Chairman Sterling Evans an

04:07.030 --> 04:34.708
official endorsement by the leadership of the 
former Student Association of the changes and the

04:07.030 --> 04:34.708
Board of Directors then officially approved

04:38.519 --> 04:56.376
All of the recommended changes

04:38.519 --> 04:56.376
which had originated from the Aspirations 
Committee and its subunits, including RISL,

04:38.519 --> 04:56.376
except the change in the name.

05:00.640 --> 05:07.767
These important modifications included the 
admission of women, voluntary service in the

05:08.810 --> 05:27.248
Corps of Cadets, racial integration, gradual 
increase in admission requirements,

05:08.810 --> 05:27.248
and a broadening and deepening of the curriculum.

05:27.268 --> 05:37.838
According to Vice President Hall, paragraph, 
according to Vice President Hall,

05:27.268 --> 05:37.838
Earl Rudder had been particularly disturbed

05:40.923 --> 05:51.335
by the suggested change to Texas State University 
as the title of his alma mater.

05:55.581 --> 06:06.053
He was particularly opposed

05:55.581 --> 06:06.053
to the dilution

06:09.728 --> 06:32.952
to the elimination of any wording which would 
allow him and thousands of his contemporaries to

06:09.728 --> 06:32.952
identify their proud institution as A&M in some 
style or other.

06:39.226 --> 07:06.263
Early

06:39.226 --> 07:06.263
in 1970, when

06:39.226 --> 07:06.263
I

06:39.226 --> 07:06.263
went as chairman of the

06:39.226 --> 07:06.263
library committee to seek increased funding for 
the A&M Library.

07:15.462 --> 07:30.681
Mr. Rutter's first response to that, on that 
point, was to ask, was to say, to note that, quote,

07:15.462 --> 07:30.681
y'all are always seeking more money for the 
library. Do you think the students have read all

07:31.783 --> 07:35.007
the books we've already got? Period, quote. Then 
he promised that he would do the best he could to

07:39.453 --> 07:47.806
find extra dollars.

07:55.918 --> 08:08.717
And perhaps for the only time in my acquaintance 
with him,

07:55.918 --> 08:08.717
I sought to continue

08:11.566 --> 08:13.808
a conversation with him on other topics.

08:19.614 --> 08:37.573
And ventured to note

08:19.614 --> 08:37.573
how much progress he had created at A&M and that 
only he, quote, could have done that. With a smile,

08:40.068 --> 08:45.534
he inquired,

08:40.068 --> 08:45.534
why do you say that? Then I noted that no critic 
could argue that he wasn't a Texan or an Aggie who

08:47.335 --> 09:09.838
had served in the Corps,

08:47.335 --> 09:09.838
had courageously

08:47.335 --> 09:09.838
made his mark

09:12.856 --> 09:42.846
on behalf of the nation in World War II,

09:12.856 --> 09:42.846
was a hardworking husband,

09:12.856 --> 09:42.846
father, public servant,

09:12.856 --> 09:42.846
was not, quote, a fuddy-duddy PhD from somewhere 
else just passing through, period, quote.

09:47.298 --> 09:50.842
And that he knew quote knew his way around Austin. 
By acquaintance. With. Key individuals. Like the

09:59.671 --> 10:00.572
president. Governor. Key legislators and 
others. Period quote.

10:12.005 --> 10:16.950
The man who often identified himself as the. 
pot-bellied prexy of A&M, leaned back, smiled,

10:17.858 --> 10:27.369
and responded, oh, I never thought of any of that.

10:31.674 --> 10:38.862
As we chuckled, he added an

10:31.674 --> 10:38.862
unexpected bit of advice.

10:42.466 --> 10:44.288
If you guys had recommended

10:48.048 --> 10:59.593
the name that LSU has, then you have gotten the 
approval of every recommendation you made.

11:33.442 --> 12:01.626
When I,

11:33.442 --> 12:01.626
in confusion,

11:33.442 --> 12:01.626
asked about, quote, Louisiana State University 
as the title for a school in Texas, he shook his head

11:33.442 --> 12:01.626
in disbelief and noted

11:33.442 --> 12:01.626
that the title of the land-grant school in 
Louisiana

12:03.293 --> 12:32.693
in the Pelican State is, quote, Louisiana State 
University and Agricultural and Mechanical

12:03.293 --> 12:32.693
College, quote, and that if we had proposed such 
nomenclature

12:03.293 --> 12:32.693
for his alma mater, he and his contemporaries 
could have still, quote, called it A&M, and you

12:34.090 --> 12:51.153
youngsters gradually could have called it 
whatever you wanted, period, quote.

12:58.604 --> 13:02.629
As the months quickly ensued, not quickly, 
followed these changes, their results became

13:03.031 --> 13:12.023
more and more meaningful.

13:12.904 --> 13:23.098
The board of directors, in their wisdom,

13:12.904 --> 13:23.098
modified the recommendation regarding women

13:26.082 --> 13:35.593
so that females could enroll without restriction 
in the graduate and professional programs.

13:41.980 --> 13:53.153
But at the undergraduate level, only if they were 
dependent of an A&M employee or student or in some

13:54.719 --> 14:08.234
fuzzily worded

13:54.719 --> 14:08.234
phrase if they were seeking a degree which could 
best be obtained at A&M or something of that

13:54.719 --> 14:08.234
nature.

14:11.318 --> 14:19.427
Nevertheless,

14:11.318 --> 14:19.427
the first semesters brought great change to the 
campus.

14:24.233 --> 14:26.156
The enrollment began to grow rapidly.

14:31.184 --> 14:32.386
As the pride and. Satisfaction. Of almost all.

14:41.600 --> 14:43.402
A&M folks increased.

14:47.048 --> 14:49.231
On the other hand, paragraph on the other hand. A 
few determined.

14:55.368 --> 15:16.274
conservatives

14:55.368 --> 15:16.274
began to continue

14:55.368 --> 15:16.274
their efforts to restrain the changes.

15:19.158 --> 15:21.561
Perhaps the most determined of these

15:24.292 --> 15:52.898
conservatives was

15:24.292 --> 15:52.898
an individual from Beaumont named Charlie 
Babcock

15:24.292 --> 15:52.898
who had relentlessly

15:24.292 --> 15:52.898
authored

15:24.292 --> 15:52.898
letters Petitions,

15:53.840 --> 16:12.135
articles in newspapers,

15:53.840 --> 16:12.135
and other

15:53.840 --> 16:12.135
documents which he thought

16:26.662 --> 16:31.306
would help keep his institution.

16:44.939 --> 16:54.188
Mr. Babcock

16:44.939 --> 16:54.188
had served for many years as an officer of the 
Beaumont A&M Club, a group then known for their,

16:55.383 --> 17:21.323
the regularity of their meetings and the 
ceaseless commitment

16:55.383 --> 17:21.323
of that group to their alma mater.

17:27.091 --> 17:55.410
Because of the tenacity of Mr. Babcock's

17:27.091 --> 17:55.410
petitions, letters, and what seemed to be his 
unyielding admission that times were changing, I

17:27.091 --> 17:55.410
concluded that he must be an outdated demon with 
horns, a forked tail, and a lack

17:57.584 --> 18:02.090
of understanding.

18:06.477 --> 18:27.507
A few years later,

18:06.477 --> 18:27.507
as the Romont A&M Club prepared to celebrate the 
50th anniversary

18:06.477 --> 18:27.507
of their never having missed a month during those 
decades for their meeting,

18:36.110 --> 18:56.174
McQuarris asked if I would go with him to be the 
speaker on behalf of the A&M administration

18:36.110 --> 18:56.174
to those energetic Aggies in the largest city of 
the Golden Triangle.

18:58.837 --> 19:01.240
As we were flying over in the A&M plane,

19:05.000 --> 19:25.971
He mentioned that the group had planned to honor 
Mr. Babcock

19:05.000 --> 19:25.971
for his many years of service, although

19:05.000 --> 19:25.971
he had

19:05.000 --> 19:25.971
resigned his...

19:27.513 --> 19:34.483
He had ended his longtime service to the club and 
had absented himself

19:36.978 --> 19:46.270
since the initiation of the changes, which he 
thought would be devastatingly negative in their

19:36.978 --> 19:46.270
effect on A&M.

19:53.278 --> 20:05.854
When we arrived at the Harvest Club,

19:53.278 --> 20:05.854
the site for the celebration on the grounds of the 
Southeast Texas State Fair

20:10.492 --> 20:19.524
It seemed that six or seven hundred people were 
there, dressed appropriately for a good time.

20:24.250 --> 20:33.803
And one of the

20:24.250 --> 20:33.803
club's leaders proudly announced, he's here, Mr. 
Babcock's here.

20:36.607 --> 20:39.030
But yet he was unaware. of the plan

20:39.331 --> 20:50.345
to honor him as the concluding highlight of the 
evening.

20:50.365 --> 21:04.123
When that moment came,

20:50.365 --> 21:04.123
the master of ceremonies proudly invited Charlie 
Babcock

21:06.888 --> 21:24.706
as the most devoted Aggie in the group to come to the 
platform.

21:24.726 --> 21:36.878
That invitation followed many

21:24.726 --> 21:36.878
recollections

21:24.726 --> 21:36.878
of serious as well as humorous events.

21:43.013 --> 22:04.840
Perhaps the biggest chuckle

21:43.013 --> 22:04.840
had followed one speaker's mention

21:43.013 --> 22:04.840
that

21:43.013 --> 22:04.840
while there were women as full-time students at 
A&M, his wife had gone there in the summers

22:06.929 --> 22:13.196
while he, as a veteran, was earning his degree. And 
that although she had only earned 24 hours of

22:15.739 --> 22:31.858
credit,

22:15.739 --> 22:31.858
she, quote, met that she had more grade points than 
all the Kokonos brothers combined. That's

22:33.340 --> 22:35.923
C-O-K-I-N-O-S, period, quote.

22:42.653 --> 23:10.602
The loud applause and laughter which agreed with 
her pride

22:42.653 --> 23:10.602
came because

22:42.653 --> 23:10.602
that group of brothers had made their mark on the 
campus and in the community. as devoted public

23:12.640 --> 23:31.965
servants,

23:12.640 --> 23:31.965
but they were not known

23:12.640 --> 23:31.965
as honor roll students.

23:31.985 --> 23:40.015
Their immigrant father,

23:31.985 --> 23:40.015
when asked by a reporter during the World War, 2. 
How he felt about having quote so many sons on

23:44.045 --> 23:48.993
active duty. Quote responded. By saying that he 
wished he had twice as many sons as he did.

24:02.976 --> 24:03.617
Because. He would have been proud to to. twice as 
much gratitude for their being able to come to

24:09.543 --> 24:24.986
America to grow up in America as they had enjoyed.

24:25.006 --> 24:28.952
Period quote.

24:28.972 --> 24:36.563
But as Charlie Babcock came to the stage

24:28.972 --> 24:36.563
I studied him in surprise. Instead of the

24:41.307 --> 25:07.157
tall, muscular, determined hulk that I expected,

24:41.307 --> 25:07.157
here was a small gentleman, less than average in 
weight and height,

24:41.307 --> 25:07.157
who seemed rather shy and reserved. The crowd 
stood and cheered.

25:14.173 --> 25:38.764
And then the MC, the master of ceremonies, put his 
arm on Mr. Babcock's shoulders and pulled out a

25:14.173 --> 25:38.764
plaque

25:14.173 --> 25:38.764
and turned

25:14.173 --> 25:38.764
to mention, to say how the group wanted to honor him 
as the most diligent and energetic of all Aggies in

25:41.022 --> 26:08.481
the Beaumont club

25:41.022 --> 26:08.481
and that while they understood the

25:41.022 --> 26:08.481
integrity of his unyielding opposition to all of 
the changes

26:12.899 --> 26:18.285
They hoped that now he would accept it. Again, the 
crowd jumped to their feet

26:18.305 --> 26:41.809
as the little man stepped to the microphone and 
motioned for them

26:18.305 --> 26:41.809
to return to their seat, to be seated and in their 
applause.

26:45.029 --> 27:11.942
He began to sob

26:45.029 --> 27:11.942
and then offered

26:45.029 --> 27:11.942
a truly unforgettable request, saying only, 
ladies and gentlemen, please forgive me. I was

27:11.962 --> 27:12.943
wrong.

27:17.429 --> 27:35.070
As we were returning on the plane, I asked 
Buchwaris to explain this man to me who had seemed

27:17.429 --> 27:35.070
to be a villain, but now obviously was a truly 
sensitive hero.

27:38.033 --> 27:46.423
He noted that Babcock had graduated without any 
particular academic distinction. gone to work

27:48.023 --> 27:51.128
for one of the refineries in the Beaumont area.

27:54.834 --> 28:01.945
That he and his wife, a public school teacher, had 
two children. But their daughter,

28:04.068 --> 28:16.427
unfortunately, had died suddenly one day in her 
junior high years from an unexpected heart

28:04.068 --> 28:16.427
ailment. And he added, before he added, quote, and 
then their son,

28:18.331 --> 28:36.368
dash, quote,

28:18.331 --> 28:36.368
and I interrupted with, no, no, I hope not. Before 
he added, their son died in a wreck going home to

28:38.670 --> 28:47.038
Beaumont.

28:49.364 --> 28:55.071
during his sophomore year at A&M.

28:55.091 --> 29:11.271
So I concluded my quick change of evaluation of 
this man

28:55.091 --> 29:11.271
with the heartfelt comment, I forgive him.

29:15.356 --> 29:16.317
Ever since then,

29:19.199 --> 29:32.731
when I attempt to offer

29:19.199 --> 29:32.731
examples of the depth of A&M of former student 
feelings and devotion.

29:35.353 --> 29:40.858
I mention Mr. Babcock and that evening.

29:44.882 --> 29:48.565
Following my muster remarks in Austin,

29:51.937 --> 30:18.535
On April 21st, 1997,

29:51.937 --> 30:18.535
a

29:51.937 --> 30:18.535
tall man came up to me

29:51.937 --> 30:18.535
and indicated he wanted to give me, quote, the rest 
of the story, quote, about Charlie Babcock.

30:25.062 --> 30:31.692
When I asked him his name, he told me, and now I can't 
remember, I'll have to fold that in later.

30:39.163 --> 30:53.905
When I heard his identification,

30:39.163 --> 30:53.905
I asked for verification and then told him that he 
was the finest hurdler that I had ever seen. He

30:59.660 --> 31:02.602
inquired, what did I mean? And I mentioned that in 
the spring of 1948, he won the district, regional,

31:02.642 --> 31:15.754
and state championships in the higher hurdles, 
setting a record in every race. He wondered how I

31:17.816 --> 31:21.900
knew that, and I told him that he was a Beaumont 
Royal Purple. at that time and that I, as an orange

31:23.247 --> 31:25.849
tiger,
