Was it worth it? Was it worth it for us to be there?

00:10.946 --> 00:11.747
Well, I don't know. In my personal opinion, it was 
certainly worth it for long periods of time. What

00:19.377 --> 00:26.967
wasn't too palatable to me to see us just pull out 
and let the North move down without opposition.

00:27.723 --> 00:35.635
But it was the old idea of we've been here long 
enough, we've trained our armies long enough,

00:27.723 --> 00:35.635
we've supported governments long enough, and if 
they can't do it on their own, they'll never be able

00:27.723 --> 00:35.635
to do it. Now it's time to cut, which is the 
short-sighted Western view. We're not much on

00:42.185 --> 00:47.033
getting into things we can't make happen 
overnight. They don't care how long it takes.

00:50.438 --> 00:54.043
They're not worried about it because they're not 
aimed at individual goals. They're aimed at group

00:54.063 --> 00:55.165
goals. If it takes 100 years, it takes 100 years.

01:01.426 --> 01:01.527
Okay.
