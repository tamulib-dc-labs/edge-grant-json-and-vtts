WEBVTT

00:04.992 --> 00:14.871
I don't like the

00:04.992 --> 00:14.871
intro. Okay, we were talking about the philosophy 
of examining boards and protection of the public

00:14.891 --> 00:22.225
and the Federal Trade Commission practice rules 
and so forth. What's your general attitude toward

00:27.091 --> 00:35.004
the philosophy of whether or not examining boards 
really are in the best interest of the public?

00:43.758 --> 00:49.107
I feel that the duty and responsibility of the 
board is to protect the public. That's

00:53.633 --> 01:11.131
basically the main reason that the board exists is 
not for any other reason except to protect the

00:53.633 --> 01:11.131
public. And in examining these applicants,

01:19.613 --> 01:47.646
It's difficult to

01:19.613 --> 01:47.646
visualize, so to speak, but I think it's the 
responsibility of the board to not figure out

01:19.613 --> 01:47.646
necessarily who is the most capable individual

01:51.271 --> 02:04.923
taking examination, but how far can we go with an 
individual and let him have a license and he won't

01:51.271 --> 02:04.923
be a danger to the public? See what I'm talking 
about? Instead of eliminating

02:08.407 --> 02:19.877
them or figuring out which one is the best, we try to 
figure out How sorry can a man be and still not be a

02:19.992 --> 02:27.403
danger to the public? It creates a problem. I saw an 
editorial in the American Animal Hospital

02:29.586 --> 02:33.171
Journal the other day. It was... I don't know 
whether it was an editorial or a letter to the

02:36.636 --> 02:39.260
editor. Of course, there is some difference 
between those two. But the statement made in the

02:43.826 --> 02:48.413
journal was... that he looked in the not too far 
distant future for the only thing for an examining

02:49.270 --> 03:11.020
board to do, if they had a diploma from a legitimate 
veterinary school, that they were obligated to

02:49.270 --> 03:11.020
let him practice anywhere, anytime. Do you think 
that time may be coming? I would hope not. I think

03:16.388 --> 03:19.578
that there should be some changes. I feel that

03:20.140 --> 03:29.470
we should examine on a regional basis rather than 
just a state. Possibly Arkansas, Louisiana,

03:29.905 --> 03:41.236
Texas, Oklahoma, and even New Mexico could band 
together and have an examination. And if I pass

03:41.997 --> 03:46.821
that examination, I can practice in any of those 
states. It probably never will come. I have some

03:50.064 --> 03:53.768
ideas about education, too. I

03:53.788 --> 03:59.153
don't know why I bring it up at this time, but I 
firmly believe that our educational process

03:59.977 --> 04:16.551
would be better utilized if we had an interchange 
of students from these various veterinary

04:17.037 --> 04:21.185
schools. Three or four students from Texas could 
go to Iowa, and three or four from Iowa could go to

04:22.007 --> 04:33.710
Washington, and three or four from Washington go 
to Cornell, intermingle them. Then those kids

04:33.730 --> 04:36.295
would come back home You know, every institution 
is strong in different areas. And they could bring

04:42.805 --> 04:48.092
information back from Iowa that would be 
beneficial to the state of Texas. And we could take

04:48.653 --> 04:59.048
information from Texas or background material 
from Texas and it would be beneficial to these

04:48.653 --> 04:59.048
other schools. And why they don't do it, I don't 
know. But back to this matter of examination, I

05:02.633 --> 05:23.292
think that this

05:02.633 --> 05:23.292
matter of a degree, of a diploma from a school, 
doesn't...

05:24.757 --> 05:46.400
qualify you to practice, say, in Texas because you 
may have a background, a moral background that's

05:24.757 --> 05:46.400
not suitable, a type of person that we wouldn't 
want to practice in Texas, even though you had a

05:24.757 --> 05:46.400
fine record from the school that you come from.

05:49.663 --> 05:52.266
That would be the... The main reason that I would 
see to not just accept them on a diploma. We have had

05:59.775 --> 06:21.257
graduates from A&M College

05:59.775 --> 06:21.257
that

05:59.775 --> 06:21.257
really, and I'm sure other schools have too, that 
they'd rather they hadn't graduated, but they

05:59.775 --> 06:21.257
thought, well, the board will catch them. We'll 
let them get on through school, but the board will

06:22.216 --> 06:26.480
cut them off. They should have been cut off right 
down there before they got their diploma. Maybe we

06:30.503 --> 06:34.587
shouldn't say anything about that. That's all 
right. Well, it's happened. It's happened. And

06:39.511 --> 06:41.353
I'm sure it's happened in other places, too. In the 
growth of the Texas Veteran Medical Association,

06:42.894 --> 06:51.902
it's, of course, grown with the number of 
practitioners. Do you feel that there, to

06:52.237 --> 07:13.071
begin with, our practice acts didn't have very 
much to say about the practice, but in the last

06:52.237 --> 07:13.071
several years the practice act, especially 
during the 50s, became quite stringent, and 60s

06:52.237 --> 07:13.071
also.

07:16.036 --> 07:19.341
Do you feel that the TVMA really did An excellent 
service in getting those things worked out

07:21.245 --> 07:26.854
together with the legislators.

07:29.278 --> 07:32.042
Specifically, what would you have represented? 
Well, the greatest change in the Practice Act, I

07:32.062 --> 07:36.669
believe, took place in the 50s. Up until that time, 
there hadn't been much change in it since it was

07:38.773 --> 07:46.645
originally inaugurated in about 1911.

07:47.553 --> 07:54.683
At that time, the Practice Act, Paul Blunt was 
instrumental in working with that at that time.

07:58.388 --> 08:06.238
Do you feel the TVMA did the public a great service 
in working that out?

08:10.604 --> 08:17.053
I don't recall specifics right at this time. But

08:17.337 --> 08:29.911
no doubt it was an attempt to kind of bring us to 
modernize the practice act, shall we say. And it

08:30.872 --> 08:40.041
probably has

08:30.872 --> 08:40.041
deficiencies and things that we wouldn't prefer. 
But any time you go before the legislature a

08:45.721 --> 08:48.726
practice act, there's no telling what you'll end 
up with. But I think that generally, by and large,

08:50.889 --> 09:02.909
they've done a pretty good job on that.

09:02.929 --> 09:12.825
I think you'll agree that practice has changed a 
lot since you first went into the profession in

09:02.929 --> 09:12.825
1939 until the present day. You've already stated 
that practice was difficult back in those days due

09:14.510 --> 09:22.124
to lack of equipment and medications and so forth. 
Tell us about some of the specific things and

09:23.206 --> 09:33.345
specific areas that you've seen changes during 
your career in the practice of medicine.

09:35.182 --> 09:51.368
There are just many things that have come about, 
instruments, drugs, procedures, that have made

09:35.182 --> 09:51.368
practice more enjoyable. I pointed out here one 
thing in particular that was available that

10:00.950 --> 10:05.657
wasn't available when I started in practice. It 
was shortly after the war. That was the

10:08.200 --> 10:18.334
introduction of sulfapyridine, which we used to 
treat foot rot in cattle. I recall once I went out on

10:18.355 --> 10:29.370
a call northwest of town shortly after 
sulfapyridine was available. Up until that time,

10:29.620 --> 10:48.692
we'd have to put bandages and use this old pow blue 
and whatnot on these cases and change the bandage

10:29.620 --> 10:48.692
and all for these foot rot cases, you know. after 
self-pyridine was available, you take two ounces

10:49.533 --> 11:00.008
of that and put it in a pint of water and give it 
intravenously to the animal and turn him loose.

11:00.449 --> 11:01.430
Not ever bandage him. And this old lady wasn't 
going to pay me because she came out to treat that

11:01.750 --> 11:08.480
cow and didn't even put a bandage on her foot. I 
said, well, the cow got all right, didn't it? Yeah,

11:10.803 --> 11:12.646
but you didn't do like you should have. You didn't 
bandage it. But, I mean, that's just one example.

11:15.831 --> 11:18.274
And here... That's one of those things you went up 
against in practice. That's right. You get it

11:24.151 --> 11:26.680
fixed better and they don't think you've worked 
hard enough. That's right. They haven't worked

11:27.102 --> 11:29.530
hard enough. Another thing that's come about in 
these modern years is the discovery of what causes

11:30.218 --> 11:38.910
wheat pasture poisoning. That used to be a big 
problem to us. Those old cows, you'd push them

11:42.635 --> 11:49.604
around and they'd become paralyzed and fight you 
and all that. And of course, it's magnesium

11:49.704 --> 11:52.347
deficiency. We've...

11:57.168 --> 12:10.020
In 39, and even when I started into practice in Fort 
Worth, we had the so-called X disease problem,

11:57.168 --> 12:10.020
chlorinated naphthalene poisoning. We didn't 
know what it was, and Dr. Smith had come up to see me,

12:10.040 --> 12:25.875
and we'd have anywhere from one to two to several in 
a herd involved, and he'd take cultures, and he'd

12:10.040 --> 12:25.875
look, and he'd do this, that, and the other, and 
then... About 1951 or 1952,

12:26.716 --> 12:42.590
we had an outbreak of X disease, and catalept was 
traced to cottonseed cake. They had... They had

12:45.076 --> 12:56.534
sucked all the normal oils out of that cake and then 
used mineral oil, incorporated mineral oil into

12:45.076 --> 12:56.534
that meal so that it would cake, see? So they could 
make a cake. And this particular mineral oil had

12:58.337 --> 13:11.037
chlorinated naphthalene in it, which is a product 
that's used to make oils stronger and more durable

12:58.337 --> 13:11.037
in machinery, see? But it doesn't work very good in 
cattle. But that was a big problem and a big

13:13.240 --> 13:16.705
headache to us. And when that was finally found 
out, I remember Dr. Smith was up here one day

13:16.725 --> 13:28.883
talking to us after we'd found out what caused the X 
disease and all. And he was talking to the head of

13:29.564 --> 13:34.812
the Trader's Oil mill out here. He was in the crowd. 
And he said, we... had worked for years trying to

13:42.569 --> 13:47.774
figure out what caused this X disease. And then 
this Trader's oil mill provides us with this

13:48.174 --> 13:52.778
wonderful experiment. It was millions of dollars 
that cost Trader's. But we found that out. And we

13:57.923 --> 14:06.351
stopped the recurrence of X disease by removing 
that. There used to be in old tractor oils and

14:07.112 --> 14:09.554
greases. And those cattle would get out and lick on 
it. And you've probably seen it in your practice.

14:16.022 --> 14:21.628
Another thing that we know about now is oak bud 
poisoning and acorn poisoning in horses. And we

14:22.770 --> 14:29.557
see more nitrate poisoning and we have better ways 
of handling it. Because of improved fertilizers,

14:30.038 --> 14:38.327
it brought on more nitrate poisoning.

14:39.320 --> 14:48.089
We used to see these photosensitization problems 
that we didn't know what caused them. We'd see a

14:48.129 --> 14:56.919
white-footed horse that would get an eczema and an 
irritation on his feet. And now we know that it's

14:57.700 --> 15:04.787
part of that photosensitization complex. The 
treatment of coccidiosis of all animals, before

15:04.953 --> 15:17.575
we had sulfa drugs, we were just fighting in the 
dark. Along with other drugs that we have, we have

15:18.016 --> 15:28.294
others now, but your sulfa was one of the first 
drugs that was effective against coccidiosis.

15:29.287 --> 15:47.392
bacterial pneumonias back before the war, that 
was a big problem, but with the advent of sulfurs

15:29.287 --> 15:47.392
and penicillin, well, your bacterial pneumonias

15:29.287 --> 15:47.392
became a lesser problem.

15:50.876 --> 15:58.787
We still have

15:50.876 --> 15:58.787
a ways to go with treatment of viral resp in fact all 
viral diseases now in vaccines we have rhino

15:59.408 --> 16:22.986
pneumonitis vaccine for horses your influenza 
vaccine which along with your strep bactrims

15:59.408 --> 16:22.986
almost has eliminated the old distemper problem 
in horses if immunization is properly carried

16:23.219 --> 16:31.708
out. And think of the improvements that have come 
about in vaccines, viral vaccines for dogs and

16:32.950 --> 16:46.765
cats, just since the war. Would you write

16:47.146 --> 16:52.011
Danny?

16:53.527 --> 17:01.297
The coronavirus vaccines have come into being for 
these diarrhea problems in caves. We now have

17:01.357 --> 17:16.215
infectious bovine rhinotracheitis vaccine, 
bovine virus diarrhea vaccine, which we knew

17:01.357 --> 17:16.215
nothing about back when I started practicing. 
We've gone through the the lepto complex. And we

17:24.141 --> 17:31.133
now know the different strains or whatnot of 
lepto. And we have Bactrins that are effective

17:31.213 --> 17:37.824
against those particular strains. We have Vibrio 
vaccine, which we didn't have back then. We have

17:43.012 --> 17:47.800
improved rabies vaccines.

17:50.125 --> 18:09.026
In the last 40 years, we've seen

17:50.125 --> 18:09.026
the

17:50.125 --> 18:09.026
diagnosis and control of swine ear syphilis 
become more effective. I remember

18:09.406 --> 18:17.095
about 1950,

18:18.863 --> 18:23.791
I had suspected that I had erysipelas and some 
swine out here. And the old federal veterinarian

18:24.572 --> 18:36.070
in charge said, well, there's only been, now this 
was as late as 1950, there's only been one outbreak

18:24.572 --> 18:36.070
of erysipelas reported in Texas. That was down in, 
oh,

18:36.110 --> 18:44.042
way down around the King Ranch. Down around 
Kingsville. And I said, well, I believe I have

18:47.433 --> 18:50.517
some. He said, bring me an enlarged hock, you know, 
those joints, enlarged joints. He said, bring me a

18:57.688 --> 19:04.738
joint, an enlarged joint, and I'll send it up to 
Maryland, Beltsville. That's where they, before

19:04.858 --> 19:07.842
they had the disease laboratory out of date. 
They'll send it up to Beltsville. So I packed it in

19:10.205 --> 19:14.892
Borax or something like that, you know, and We 
shipped it up there, and about two months later,

19:16.019 --> 19:22.046
they reported back, yeah, you've got ear 
syphilis. Two months later? Yeah, yeah, at least

19:23.147 --> 19:24.929
two months. But your syphilis organism grows very 
slowly. Yes, right. That's true, that's true. But

19:30.716 --> 19:32.939
it took that long. It wouldn't take that long with 
these newer, sophisticated procedures. But what

19:37.244 --> 19:40.147
did I have? I had only ear syphilis serum. I would 
give these baby pigs this serum. Then we'd turn

19:49.553 --> 19:53.337
them out on that infected ground, and they'd do all 
right. I'd turn a litter out there without it, and

19:53.698 --> 19:57.422
man, they'd just wither up. They'd just dry up. You 
know what I mean. We've eradicated hog collar in my

20:03.369 --> 20:11.338
lifetime in practice.

20:12.078 --> 20:18.788
We've made wonderful strides in controlling 
anaplasmosis. A little aerosol or some of the

20:19.970 --> 20:36.456
arsenicals of prayer was about all we had back in 
1939 and 40 and 41 for anaplasmosis. And now... We

20:40.968 --> 20:50.937
have vaccines to protect the animal and 
antibiotics to control the carrier phase of the

20:40.968 --> 20:50.937
disease. And it's much easier to handle. And we 
have the tools to take care of it today where we

20:57.483 --> 21:03.248
didn't back in the day. We've made tremendous 
progress in the field of nutrition.

21:11.731 --> 21:27.517
Our research has carried us into the field of 
immunology, and we can pinpoint these

21:11.731 --> 21:27.517
immunodeficiencies now that we had no idea what 
was going on 40 years ago.

21:31.744 --> 21:38.295
Laminitis in horses, treatment is still a 
problem, but... The modern day x-rays and

21:38.933 --> 21:52.151
research gives us some tools

21:38.933 --> 21:52.151
to kind of predict. We know that we can produce 
laminitis by,

21:52.191 --> 22:07.472
researchers have done that by, you know, just by 
feeding high carbohydrate diet. And they can tell

22:07.874 --> 22:12.959
pretty well when the animal is going to come down 
with laminitis. And through our x-rays, we can

22:14.380 --> 22:33.679
give a pretty good prognosis on how the animal is 
going to come along and

22:14.380 --> 22:33.679
whether you've got a rotation

22:14.380 --> 22:33.679
there or not. And we're much further along than we 
were 40 or 50 years ago in the field of laminitis.

22:42.719 --> 22:51.813
Bacterial diarrhea in the young, we have much 
better prevention and control of that. Our

22:53.256 --> 23:00.207
Clostridium infections, and especially cattle, 
They were a real problem originally in the

23:00.541 --> 23:05.047
unvaccinated individuals. And

23:05.187 --> 23:30.278
even in the vaccinated ones, we had some of those, 
then you had and

23:05.187 --> 23:30.278
some of those others that were still there that we 
weren't able to, until they got these new, more

23:05.187 --> 23:30.278
sophisticated methods of diagnosis, we couldn't 
couldn't diagnose it but they've incorporated

23:30.629 --> 23:57.919
all those things into their into the vaccines now 
and uh we don't look back we just give them the whole

23:30.629 --> 23:57.919
wagon load and it and and it pretty well prevents it 
we've got anti-inflammatory we've got

23:30.629 --> 23:57.919
butazolidine banamine and all those things that 
we did we didn't have those didn't have anything

23:30.629 --> 23:57.919
just just an old aspirin was the closest thing we 
had to it back there then We've had tremendous

23:59.333 --> 24:11.520
progress in the field of urinary stimulants, 
Lasix, Hydrazide, and those things for edema and

23:59.333 --> 24:11.520
urinary stimulants. But the old Pastorella bug is 
still with us. You know, they used to diagnose

24:14.643 --> 24:23.561
hemorrhagic septicemia, which was your old 
Pastorella. And we went through a phase there.

24:29.995 --> 24:39.446
before the war where we thought it was in the 
picture on pathology, and then they phased it out

24:29.995 --> 24:39.446
and said, no, now it's come back. It's involved in a 
lot of these shipping fever deals where you have

24:39.906 --> 24:48.376
the viruses and then the pastoral moves in. But 
it's been interesting to see that. Now, we still

24:52.220 --> 24:59.108
have problems with the viruses, but we can pretty 
well... control the straight pasteurilosis by

25:00.100 --> 25:05.549
bacteria and antibiotics, of course.

25:08.954 --> 25:10.256
Herd health is much better. We know more about 
advising people on herd health today than we did

25:10.637 --> 25:17.227
years ago. Internal parasites. We were just, 
phenothiazine was just on the horizon in 1940. We

25:25.972 --> 25:30.539
were just beginning to use a little of it. Before 
that, there really wasn't much of anything, was

25:30.559 --> 25:34.264
there? Just tobacco dust. Oil of kinapodium and 
tobacco dust. Oil of kinapodium and tobacco dust

25:39.250 --> 25:45.379
and nicotine sulfate and that kind of stuff, you 
know. Which was no doubt better than nothing. But

25:48.413 --> 25:52.521
there again, you had to talk about pasture 
rotation and that sort of thing. That's right.

25:53.183 --> 25:53.784
That's true. Antimidics just weren't there. 
Right. We've seen old smear 62, which is

25:56.509 --> 26:04.285
diphenylamine, you know, and black. It had to come 
along to... treat for screwworms, but now we've

26:06.520 --> 26:10.464
eradicated screwworms. Now, the modern 
veterinarian, the young veterinarian, my son

26:10.924 --> 26:20.353
knows not a damn thing about screwworms, but 
wasn't that a great day when we got rid of

26:10.924 --> 26:20.353
screwworms? Let me ask you a question. You know, 
you've done the same thing. You go out and treat a

26:25.718 --> 26:33.405
cow surgically or treat one with screwworms, and 
you'd have to use Smear 62. And the smear was a good

26:33.689 --> 26:38.215
word for it because you've got to smear it all over 
everywhere, including under your fingernails.

26:39.236 --> 26:49.931
Now, why did it take so long to figure out that you 
didn't have to use lamp black to dilute your

26:39.236 --> 26:49.931
diphenylamine with or anything else? You know, 
almost anything will kill screw arms. You just

26:52.033 --> 26:56.599
need a vehicle to take it in or even oil solutions. 
Why in the world did Smear 62 have to ever be

26:57.721 --> 27:03.088
invented in the first place? It goes back to the old 
pine tar. They had to have something that looked

27:06.637 --> 27:08.961
like pine tar. You know, we used to use pine tar 
around them to kind of prevent re-infestation of

27:09.021 --> 27:15.791
screw worms. And I guess they had to kind of 
duplicate something of a pine tar nature. Lord,

27:22.289 --> 27:22.990
no. But there are a lot of vehicles that can take 
that stuff in besides lamp black. That's right.

27:27.795 --> 27:35.004
But

27:27.795 --> 27:35.004
they were looking for something comparable to 
what they'd always had. They weren't improving on

27:35.024 --> 27:39.289
the past. They were just duplicating it. Well, 
zinc oxide, you know, sticks real good. Yeah. Put

27:44.234 --> 27:45.175
it in that. That's right. Different color. Oh, 
that's right. Very true. Very true. For us white

27:50.261 --> 27:51.122
folks. But the day they got rid of that glaring 
black stuff is a great day, too. Well, that's

27:57.188 --> 27:58.210
right. Back there in those days, I'm talking about 
before the war, we knew nothing about chlordane,

27:59.831 --> 28:09.141
BHC, DDT, organophosphates. All of those things 
came on later, you know. All we had back there then

28:13.370 --> 28:25.897
was arsenical dip, crisodip, and the old 
lacrycursalis saponatus, which is the BAI, the

28:13.370 --> 28:25.897
old BAI. And tick tocks. Tick tocks. Remember tick 
tocks? Well, that's what we used on ticks. It

28:32.806 --> 28:35.692
didn't kill the ticks, but it sure made the dogs 
irritated. Oh, yeah.

28:40.803 --> 28:42.166
What was the basis for that? Oh, they had some 
irritating material in there. They felt if it

28:45.152 --> 28:50.143
irritated enough, if they didn't come back 
with... Swell testicles that came back with sore

28:50.123 --> 28:52.566
eyes. Yeah, yeah, right. I remember the name, but I 
didn't associate the product. We've had

28:59.036 --> 29:07.247
cortisones and antihistamines are new, and the 
adenoviruses weren't heard of back there then.

29:10.212 --> 29:14.197
Blue tongue in sheep was recognized in this 
country in 1938. A vaccine for... The vaccine for

29:18.912 --> 29:31.805
contagious exanthema of sheep had just been 
developed down at the experiment station.

29:32.926 --> 29:43.897
I was told when I was a senior that TB had been 
eradicated, and the BAI said brucellosis would be

29:32.926 --> 29:43.897
eradicated in three or four years. That was in 38.

29:49.692 --> 29:54.657
We knew nothing of chlamydial, mycotic, or 
mycotoxins. And all of those things were to come

29:55.979 --> 29:59.242
after that. That's just a few of the many things 
that occurred to me this morning. And that doesn't

30:06.489 --> 30:09.272
scratch the surface. Yes. Dan, I'd like to ask you 
another kind of personal question. You know, back

30:16.440 --> 30:18.602
in the good old days, when we had all these 
difficulties and problems and so forth and so on,

30:18.700 --> 30:29.459
the clients didn't expect quite as much of you as 
they expect of you now, did they?

30:32.324 --> 30:38.195
Well,

30:32.324 --> 30:38.195
they compared you to that quack, see? You had to try 
to do a better job and sell them. And let them

30:42.798 --> 30:47.723
convince them that you could do a better job than 
that quack could do. Today, with

30:48.344 --> 31:12.349
all of these television programs and all of these 
stories about, I saw they had a, somewhere the

30:48.344 --> 31:12.349
other day they had a horse with a,

30:48.344 --> 31:12.349
somebody had put a false leg on him. so he could make 
a breeder. And they think every horse that breaks

31:15.296 --> 31:21.446
his leg now that you can put a false leg on him and 
keep him going. I guess we've brought that on

31:23.049 --> 31:27.276
ourselves, though, you know. The doctors have 
been smart enough to say, well, now look here,

31:28.678 --> 31:33.305
we're not sure about this. We're going to have to 
send some of this into the laboratory. We're going

31:35.389 --> 31:37.392
to have to do this and that and the other bit. We 
thought we had to give a diagnosis right across the

31:38.435 --> 31:46.868
table, you know, and we were caused by a whole lot of 
that. I can't help but recall somewhere about 15

31:49.232 --> 32:04.155
years ago, I think it was about 15 years ago, 
perhaps a little less, Jacques Genny operated on a

32:05.603 --> 32:15.814
on a horse's fetlock that had been injured in a race 
for a comminuted bone situation in there. Did a

32:16.955 --> 32:26.446
beautiful job of surgery, put it together, and the 
dog and the patient mutilated itself heavily on

32:16.955 --> 32:26.446
recovery from anesthesia. And the horse was 
subsequently euthanized and got a tremendous

32:28.108 --> 32:32.893
amount of national publicity as you're aware. Dr. 
Wagenstein, who was an old, at that time he was

32:37.168 --> 32:54.909
quite old, of course he's now deceased, but he's a 
surgeon, a human surgeon from the University of

32:37.168 --> 32:54.909
Minnesota Medical Schools, invented the 
Wagenstein pump and so forth and so on. And he says

32:56.431 --> 33:04.180
they certainly must be able to do better than that 
and come up with a better way.

33:04.750 --> 33:25.129
Of all the challenges that you have met in

33:04.750 --> 33:25.129
veterinary medicine and in equine practice, do 
you think there is a greater one than the sedation

33:04.750 --> 33:25.129
and anesthesia of horses for long, drawn-out 
surgeries?

33:27.991 --> 33:34.217
I'm talking about, you know, fracture repairs 
that take two or three hours and so forth and so on.

33:34.838 --> 33:39.082
They have come a long ways in that field in the last 
few years.

33:41.865 --> 33:48.351
You know, anything I couldn't do with mag chloral, 
I just didn't do it. But with this guacolate and

33:48.371 --> 34:03.006
with the

33:48.371 --> 34:03.006
respiratory thing,

33:48.371 --> 34:03.006
they've improved that procedure materially. I 
believe in this particular horse, didn't they use

34:03.526 --> 34:07.212
inhalation anesthesia? That was on that mare, 
that good mare that died, wasn't it? Yes, while it

34:13.362 --> 34:15.265
was in the race, you know. Yeah, that's that good 
mare that was going to win everything. Yes.

34:24.280 --> 34:26.524
And I think Bill Reed was in on that, too. Bill Reed 
was in on it. Uh... Yeah, I believe they did use

34:32.433 --> 34:37.399
inhalation on that. That's just about the best you 
can use, so to speak. Right, right. There are still

34:43.667 --> 34:46.831
some of those that are a real challenge, right? Oh, 
that's very true. That's very true.

34:55.838 --> 35:00.705
There's a tremendous amount of research going on 
in that field right now. See, you don't need to give

35:00.725 --> 35:02.468
up yet. You can probably figure out something to 
help that out yet. Well, I'll leave that to the

35:04.832 --> 35:08.898
younger people. By the way, there's a thing

35:11.221 --> 35:24.782
that we're doing to our students that is wrong. But 
in a way, I guess we all thought it until we got out

35:24.998 --> 35:30.545
and found out differently. They teach these kids 
that they're

35:31.386 --> 35:41.999
worth maybe $30,000 or $40,000 a year when they get 
out. And these kids are looking to get rich quick.

35:46.784 --> 35:49.668
They're going to retire after about five years. In 
practice, well, you don't do it that way. You don't

35:53.939 --> 35:55.181
do it that way. You know what I'm talking about. I 
know what you're talking about.

36:04.095 --> 36:10.024
You had some other investments besides practice. 
Your outside investments allowed you to retire.

36:13.770 --> 36:21.158
If I had to have depended just on my practice, my 
wife and kids and I could have eaten pretty good.

36:21.258 --> 36:27.664
But we'd have never been able to retire and go to 
Europe every once in a while or take a trip when we

36:21.258 --> 36:27.664
get ready. It's your outside investments that 
takes care of you or keeps you in the poorhouse, I

36:28.605 --> 36:38.155
think, most of the time. I was going to ask you that 
question, and you've pretty well brought it up.

36:45.135 --> 36:46.998
The next question is about the youngsters. They 
don't seem to have the camaraderie or the desire to

36:48.179 --> 36:56.549
get together and solve their problems mutually. 
They feel, to me, they seem that the problems have

36:56.589 --> 37:00.974
been solved. Now they need to ride off into the 
sunset and do their own thing and that there isn't

37:03.177 --> 37:12.409
any real need for the camaraderie, especially in 
local associations. They can see where a state

37:12.449 --> 37:19.459
association can do things, you know, on a higher 
level with their seminars and so on. But there's no

37:19.579 --> 37:27.209
need for the local people to get together to 
discuss their problem cases or how can we serve the

37:19.579 --> 37:27.209
public better. Do you seem to have any Feeling 
toward that or observation also or not? Hadn't

37:33.748 --> 37:35.691
changed a darn bit in 50 years.

37:39.177 --> 37:43.183
But do you feel the youngsters have the 
camaraderie that we used to? I

37:43.824 --> 37:54.261
feel that

37:43.824 --> 37:54.261
there's always been a a little petty jealousy or 
something that prevents them from

37:56.249 --> 38:10.603
sitting down and discussing the problems and 
working them out as a group. I remember, let me see.

38:18.250 --> 38:22.054
Yeah, it was right after the war.

38:23.873 --> 38:27.056
46, 47, somewhere along there. I was going to get 
our local association all involved. I was going to

38:31.160 --> 38:32.542
get everybody in. Somebody said, well, Dr. 
McQuistion,

38:32.582 --> 38:42.912
he never comes to the meeting. I said, I'll get him. 
I called him. I said, say, we've got a veterinary

38:46.456 --> 38:48.858
meeting tonight. I'll come by and pick you up. And 
we'd go, oh, no, Dan. He said. I won't go he says

38:55.649 --> 39:19.243
they'll get down there and argue about what 
they're going to charge for rabies vaccination

38:55.649 --> 39:19.243
and then they'll all go home and do differently 
tomorrow there there's just I don't know there's

38:55.649 --> 39:19.243
something I wish I knew the answer to that question 
you posed. I'd like to see local veterinary groups

39:25.099 --> 39:38.057
be more better organized and more cooperative and 
just get along better. But really they never have

39:40.200 --> 39:44.927
in this area.

39:47.641 --> 39:53.571
That's not good, but do you have any suggestions? 
No, I don't. What I know is that down in our local

39:55.815 --> 40:04.089
association, we had fellows like Elmo Crenshaw 
and Vernon Dietz and Jack Gray. They were unusual

40:05.150 --> 40:07.214
individuals. And we all hung together like just a 
bunch of peas in a pod, and whenever things weren't

40:07.234 --> 40:13.885
going right or we had a problem or we didn't think we 
were doing client right. We'd all get together and

40:17.692 --> 40:21.058
see what was wrong and try to straighten the thing 
out. That's the way it ought to be. But the new

40:22.201 --> 40:32.161
group, they'll come if you're going to have a 
special technique, new technique on fracture

40:22.201 --> 40:32.161
fixation or something like that. They'll get them 
out, but if it's just to talk over how we can better

40:36.477 --> 40:40.741
serve the community and so forth. Okay, I'm ready. 
Prior to that stuff. But there are two things that I

40:44.946 --> 41:01.662
kind of missed on the way coming up and I've done 
several dozen oral interviews and I always feel

40:44.946 --> 41:01.662
bad when I finish that there are a certain number of 
things we didn't go over. One of them is we didn't

41:02.844 --> 41:05.286
discuss your your family, your brothers and 
sisters, and then we didn't discuss your marriage

41:06.397 --> 41:26.271
and your family, and I think it would be well to 
mention your brothers and sisters and what they

41:06.397 --> 41:26.271
did and do, and also your marriage and your family 
and what they did and do. Yes. Well, I think that

41:33.920 --> 41:41.547
take my family first, not this family, but my 
brothers and sisters. I

41:41.687 --> 42:02.087
was very fortunate to be a member of a family such

41:41.687 --> 42:02.087
as I had.

42:03.367 --> 42:08.476
Not an ounce of jealousy nor greed in any one of 
them. Who were your brothers and sisters? Well,

42:12.282 --> 42:15.909
W.L. William Anderson. Who was named after your 
father, right? Named after my father, and he's a

42:20.236 --> 42:22.981
veterinarian in Dallas. And incidentally, in 120 
years of... existence of the American Veterinary

42:30.873 --> 42:34.038
Medical Association. I believe it's, well, it's 
longer than that now, 125 years ago. There's only

42:38.564 --> 42:44.833
been two brothers served as president of AVMA, and 
that was Dub and myself. And I'm very proud of him

42:45.755 --> 42:57.792
because he has been a very outstanding and 
successful veterinarian, and I'm, as I say, I'm

42:58.615 --> 43:01.219
Real, real proud of the job that he's done. I had two 
sisters, a younger sister, Mary Jean, who is

43:02.361 --> 43:16.441
married to Horace Lee Williams, and they live in 
Rockwall, and he has been very successful. He's

43:16.501 --> 43:17.543
retired now. He's been successful as a developer, 
and he had a lumber business and a... concrete,

43:25.396 --> 43:27.900
ready-mix concrete outfit. I had an older sister,

43:28.801 --> 43:37.393
Virginia, who passed away last Christmas Eve. She 
has two children. One lives in Rockwall, is Mary

43:44.203 --> 43:48.609
Sue. She's married to Bob Smith, who is Oh, 
Executive Vice President of the Federal Reserve

43:52.244 --> 44:00.273
in Dallas, or some position similar to that. Mike, 
her brother, is Assistant Superintendent. He's

44:07.280 --> 44:14.508
just been elected to position in a high school over 
in Arlington.

44:18.492 --> 44:20.935
My wife, Frances, Frances Smith, Frances grew up 
in Garland, which is only 10 miles from Rockwell,

44:21.893 --> 44:38.160
but, uh, she was a year or two younger than I, and I 
never did know her until, uh, oh, I was in the Army, I

44:21.893 --> 44:38.160
think, before I ever met her. I tried to meet her old 
off to Crenshaw as an old veterinarian over at

44:39.222 --> 44:45.032
Garland, and, and, uh, He tried to introduce me to 
her several times when I was down there at Tara, but

44:45.687 --> 44:57.522
she saw old Dr. Crenshaw, the way he operated, and 
she didn't want to have anything to do with the darn

44:45.687 --> 44:57.522
brother, Marion. But I finally met her one night. 
My cousin introduced me to her. Oh, she finally got

45:02.068 --> 45:03.570
that out of her system. Yeah, finally introduced 
me. Well, the thing of it was, it was during the war,

45:05.612 --> 45:13.382
and all the good men had gone off to war, and she 
thought I was the last chance, see? But you know, I

45:13.936 --> 45:16.580
was pretty lucky. She has stayed at home and reared 
two fine sons while I ran around all over the

45:17.281 --> 45:31.240
country and tried to make a living.

45:32.141 --> 45:40.332
And my older son, Danny, has a degree in business 
from Texas Western University. He's been in a

45:40.919 --> 45:45.905
number of positions around the country in sales 
work. He was

45:47.707 --> 46:09.711
up in Montana and about a year ago, when I gave up my 
practice, I was ordering stuff, I was paying

45:47.707 --> 46:09.711
invoices, I was the delivery boy for everything I 
needed. And I was just handyman around there. And I

46:14.594 --> 46:17.321
said, by gosh, I've got a harder job. I'm working 
harder now than I did when I was practicing. So we

46:20.810 --> 46:25.843
brought him back here to take over that job as...
