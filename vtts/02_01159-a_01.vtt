WEBVTT

00:03.406 --> 00:06.291
and reared in... Tell me your name, four names 
first. Charles L. Bowie, the old Y.D.

00:14.604 --> 00:14.724
Bowie. Born and reared in Grandview, Texas, a 
small agricultural community south of Ford.

00:25.501 --> 00:29.447
Completed a high school education there in 1939. 
and attended Hillsborough Junior College one

00:30.338 --> 00:33.682
year. You know, Matt, were you active in 4-H, etc.? 
Active in vocational agriculture, which there

00:36.626 --> 00:54.748
wasn't a 4-H in that community, but vocational ag 
school gave you then agricultural projects, or

00:36.626 --> 00:54.748
animal projects, and sports, athletics.

00:55.609 --> 01:00.075
Well, after going one year to Hillsborough Junior 
College, I Attended two years at North Texas

01:00.477 --> 01:03.923
Agricultural College in Arlington. A major in 
general agriculture and had a little husband,

01:06.267 --> 01:10.054
Rick. Now, they were under A&M affiliation at that 
time? Yeah, that was a branch of Texas A&M at that

01:15.143 --> 01:18.269
time. And before we became UTA, we became UTA after 
I came here. Then transferred to Texas A&M. Excuse

01:25.776 --> 01:30.621
me, I remember Tom Harrington saying that was one 
of the biggest mistakes we ever made, letting that

01:25.776 --> 01:30.621
go. Oh, I can believe that. And he would have moved 
the system office. He said, that really shocked

01:33.604 --> 01:34.685
me. This was 20 years ago, you know. Well, it went to 
Dallas, you know. They've got a real university up

01:37.928 --> 01:40.571
there now. Yeah. Excuse me. They were smaller 
then. Of course, at that time, they had a good ROTC,

01:42.833 --> 01:48.379
which you could get an advanced contract. You 
could make the basic there, you could get an

01:48.399 --> 01:50.942
advanced contract. Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm. So I 
transferred there. I came here after completing

01:54.393 --> 01:56.776
two years there. Came to Texas A&M in 1942. 
Graduated in 1945 in veterinary medicine. I guess

02:07.026 --> 02:14.393
the thing that influenced me most to pursue a 
career in veterinary medicine, we operated a

02:07.026 --> 02:14.393
dairy. And in the TB eradication program, Dr. Leon 
Cloud, Leon G. Cloud, came down and tested the

02:22.777 --> 02:24.399
herd. He was driving a new black Hudson Terraplane 
coupe with a portable radio. I can still see that

02:35.033 --> 02:36.595
case. Battery-operated portable radio. This was 
about 1936, I guess. I thought, and he wore, he had a

02:43.432 --> 02:50.667
little old cap, as I remember, white cap in the 
building, like he's a sports car guy. I thought,

02:51.408 --> 02:53.332
boy, that must be alive. For a rural kiddo, that's 
got to be the greatest. It's amazing how little

02:59.605 --> 03:01.930
things like that influence you all. everybody 
somewhere along the way. Also Dr. Allman I met

03:04.741 --> 03:11.670
quite early and Dr. Burns in Cleveland by doing the 
veterinary practice for us. I can remember having

03:13.072 --> 03:30.735
gone forward Dr. Allman had been in practice in 
Itasca, Texas and there was a veterinarian I don't

03:13.072 --> 03:30.735
call his name at the moment he died and his wife was 
still operating the hospital there on South Main

03:13.072 --> 03:30.735
in Fort Worth I believe it was him and the mercy cat 
and dog, I suppose. But anyway, I went up to pick up

03:37.062 --> 03:44.168
some cowpox salve that Dr. Allman mixed up in 
medication. I must have been about 16 then. Drove

03:45.909 --> 03:50.353
the car up there by myself and got that and had a big 
day. Again, a country boy in town. But Dr. Allman,

03:53.115 --> 04:00.942
Dr. Burns, I remember Dr. Burns, his influence on 
my idea of maintaining a professional image. He

04:01.495 --> 04:07.589
officed in the back of a drug store west side of the 
square in Cleaver. And he had a coat rack in there

04:07.609 --> 04:13.041
and he always had a suit on and a tie. And he'd hang 
his coat back, coat on the rack, sit in a swivel

04:13.460 --> 04:20.389
chair and visit with the clients and talk to them 
about the name. But he never made a call without

04:21.089 --> 04:25.215
putting that coat on, hot or cold, whatever. He 
wore a suit all the time. He said they don't expect

04:27.938 --> 04:34.446
you to slop the hogs and stretch barbed wire if you 
wear a suit. He was an A&M graduate in animal

04:34.466 --> 04:41.695
science, animal husbandry, but he was an Ohio 
State graduate in veterinary medicine. He was

04:43.042 --> 04:43.983
from Cuero. He was a cousin of Patton W. Burns, who 
was head of Pharmacology College here. And he was

04:49.368 --> 04:55.534
on the board of examiners when I took the exam for 
the state board of licenses. Arthur Clayton. And

04:57.676 --> 05:02.701
when you received your degree in 45, what did you 
do? Did you go into practice? I had borrowed money,

05:06.284 --> 05:10.568
federal money, to finish up on senior year. And I 
went to work for the City of Houston Health Board. I

05:14.163 --> 05:17.287
worked there two years until I got my bills paid. 
Went back to the old hometown, which I don't always

05:19.289 --> 05:23.554
highly advocate.

05:26.838 --> 05:34.446
And went in to practice there and remained there 
for 17 years until I came to the College of Under

05:26.838 --> 05:34.446
Medicine. Now your hometown again was... 
Grandview. Grandview, yeah. I had no intention of

05:44.360 --> 05:47.164
going into academia at all. I was planning to do 
something else, perhaps go with another

05:47.264 --> 05:55.056
practitioner where we'd have a little free time. 
It was pretty confining. And

05:56.177 --> 06:02.847
I attended the TVMA meeting in San Antonio. and sat 
down with Bill Romaine, Nick Callaham, Al Price,

06:03.383 --> 06:10.891
their wives, and my wife and I. And they said they 
were looking for somebody in the clinic, Dr.

06:10.911 --> 06:18.259
Young, and he got signed on for a two-year stint in 
Pakistan. And I said, no way I can handle that. I'm

06:20.361 --> 06:21.783
just an old rural practitioner. I couldn't do 
that. But I would love to be in an environment where

06:23.945 --> 06:28.210
I have the... availability of consultation on 
problem cases, better laboratory facilities,

06:28.493 --> 06:35.783
and better diagnostic exposure. So as we'll come 
down and see us, time passed, and Jim Denton, who is

06:35.803 --> 06:53.168
now deceased, but Jim was a classmate and an 
ambulatory clinician here, he and his wife drove

06:35.803 --> 06:53.168
up one Sunday, came down to the hospital there, and 
I was washing OB chains and dirty buckets by

06:35.803 --> 06:53.168
myself. He talked to me a while and said, well just 
come down and look at it. So sure, I came down and

06:57.030 --> 07:03.217
they convinced me that I could work in the program 
and pursue a master's degree.

07:05.840 --> 07:10.425
Under those circumstances, it was a great 
reluctance, I came down. What year was that? 1964.

07:13.448 --> 07:17.873
I came in March of 1964. Okay, we'll come back to all 
that in your practice in a minute. Elmo, how did you

07:22.221 --> 07:24.305
get into this business? So forth. By osmosis, I 
guess. I don't know. Is it Elmo? E-L-M-O. My first

07:32.318 --> 07:33.620
name is Walter. Okay. My father's name was also 
Walter, so I was called throughout my life by my

07:34.481 --> 07:40.711
middle name, Elmo.

07:43.877 --> 07:44.738
I was formed. born and raised in the Lower Rio 
Grande Valley, a little community called Ed

07:46.237 --> 07:50.201
Couch. Ed Couch? Ed Couch, E-D-C-O-U-C-H. One 
word? Named after a Mr. Couch who owned the town

07:56.868 --> 08:03.834
side of Ed Couch before it became a town. And of 
course his first name was Ed, so they named the

08:05.036 --> 08:10.661
community after him. My dad was involved in 
farming a lot of the land that eventually became

08:12.967 --> 08:17.615
the community of Edcouch. And during high school, 
we had a young man that came in, a graduate of Texas

08:19.839 --> 08:29.095
A&I, that was an ag teacher. And he started off with 
a 4-H class, and then when I got into high school, I

08:30.337 --> 08:37.489
was part of the vocational agriculture class. And 
our livestock activity was most appealing to me in

08:44.688 --> 08:52.820
that, more so than the farming aspects of 
vocational agriculture. And I probably got to do

08:54.843 --> 09:01.594
more than my share of castrations and deep 
warnings and such as that by default. Oh yeah, I

09:02.395 --> 09:03.056
said. The ag classes would go out to the different 
farms and communities around kind of a dearth of

09:08.536 --> 09:11.779
veterinarians around that area at the time. And so 
ag class did an awful lot of castrations, and

09:11.880 --> 09:20.268
caponizing, and dehorning, and vaccinating, and 
all sort of activity of that nature. And I

09:20.328 --> 09:23.171
thoroughly enjoyed it. And on part of the default 
on many of the others in the class, well, I got to do

09:23.192 --> 09:29.979
more than my share of it. And I think that that was 
probably about as influential as any other one

09:29.999 --> 09:36.906
thing. my deciding to be a veterinarian

09:37.612 --> 10:01.881
my ag teacher at one time assigned the class the 
responsibility of making the report to the class

09:37.612 --> 10:01.881
on the attributes of a profession and at that point 
in time i chose to talk on veterinary medicine as a

09:37.612 --> 10:01.881
profession I also had an uncle that was a 
veterinarian. He was not a graduate of a

10:06.211 --> 10:09.375
veterinary college. He'd attended the Dallas 
Veterinary School. And I think Rutherford was

10:16.943 --> 10:24.072
instrumental in promoting and maintaining a lot 
of that schooling. And when he was a licensed

10:24.092 --> 10:28.577
veterinarian, as a result of the grandfather 
clause and the practiced as a veterinarian at the

10:29.266 --> 10:36.996
time for a number of years and was granted a license 
under the grandfather clause. He really didn't

10:38.518 --> 10:54.598
have a whole lot of influence on my decision to 
become a veterinarian except that I thought that

10:38.518 --> 10:54.598
if I had an uncle who was a veterinarian it might be 
all right for me too, but I think my ag teacher and my

10:38.518 --> 10:54.598
activities in agricultural class was probably 
more instrumental in my decision.

10:57.076 --> 10:59.940
So how'd you get to Texas A&M? Well, I guess. I guess 
as a result of my making the talk on veterinary

11:02.803 --> 11:14.198
medicine as a profession, I actually talked 
myself into it and investigated the economics of

11:02.803 --> 11:14.198
it and such as that.

11:17.882 --> 11:19.945
I came to A&M then. I was a fish and well I graduated 
from high school in 1941, came up here in September

11:20.617 --> 11:27.688
of 41. Three days after I graduated from high 
school, I hitchhiked to A&M to try to locate it,

11:29.351 --> 11:42.793
find a job and came up here and visited with Mr. 
Horsley in the employment office and course he

11:43.600 --> 11:45.643
made no promises whatsoever. I was probably 
doubting that I would ever show up as a student at

11:45.723 --> 12:03.870
A&M, but I made the initial contact with him and 
when I came back in September, I renewed

11:45.723 --> 12:03.870
acquaintances with Mr. Horsley and he put my name 
on the list and said, don't call me, I'll call you

11:45.723 --> 12:03.870
when you have something. This was a matter of 
hitchhiking, goes up here and back, which I

12:03.850 --> 12:09.561
continued to do throughout the time I was in 
school. I hitchhiked back and forth every time.

12:12.186 --> 12:13.549
That's a pretty good hitchhiker. Four occasions. 
Did you have to spend many nights out on the way?

12:17.938 --> 12:18.779
Back and forth. Did you have to spend many nights 
out on the way? I spent as long as over 24 hours. I

12:23.308 --> 12:23.749
bet. hitchhiking up here, and I've done it in less 
than eight hours, which is good times,

12:23.729 --> 12:38.824
hitchhiking, coming by way of Austin and Round 
Rock and Hearn and then back down to College

12:23.729 --> 12:38.824
Station.

12:38.845 --> 12:49.095
Made the acquaintance rather quickly of Dr. 
Marsteller, who knew my uncle, But I don't really

12:49.784 --> 12:57.196
think he admired my uncle extremely, my uncle not 
being a graduate veterinarian, but a licensed

12:49.784 --> 12:57.196
veterinarian. And I don't know whether this had a 
role to play in his judging my uncle's quarter

12:58.518 --> 13:11.539
horses down in a horse show in Mesquite, Texas. The 
year before, my uncle had both the champion mare

13:11.559 --> 13:16.787
and stallion. quarter horses, Palomino quarter 
horses at the State Fair in Dallas, and just about

13:17.341 --> 13:25.134
eight months later took him to a horse show over at 
Mesquite. Dr. Marshfeller was the judge at that

13:25.195 --> 13:29.362
show, and he didn't place. My uncle had claimed the 
animosity that Dr. Marshfeller had for judging

13:31.846 --> 13:40.581
his horses down, but None of this rubbed off on Dr. 
Markenteller as far as his attitude toward me was

13:41.270 --> 13:46.157
concerned. I had nothing but high regard and held 
him in high esteem.

13:55.011 --> 14:00.819
I struggled through my first year and failed 
chemistry, so that put me one year behind

13:55.011 --> 14:00.819
graduating. You don't pass chemistry, you don't 
start physiology, so then starting my sophomore

14:01.080 --> 14:08.070
year, I had a job working at the Shulman Theaters in 
Bryan. This would go on three nights a week, would

14:13.200 --> 14:17.225
go on for about one o'clock in the morning. The

14:17.265 --> 14:24.035
changing marquee and such as that took extra time. 
Well, the first grade report came out, and it was

14:25.376 --> 14:32.166
obvious to me that I was in trouble, and it was also 
obvious to Dr. Marsteller. He took a personal

14:32.186 --> 14:35.591
interest in each and every individual student, I 
believe. I don't think he treated me any

14:35.691 --> 14:39.576
differently than anyone else. He called me into 
his office and sat me down over there and said, Mr.

14:40.585 --> 14:51.565
Crenshaw, it seems that you're having some 
problems with your grades. Well, I don't know how

14:51.585 --> 15:03.606
to describe Dr. Marsteller's voice, but it was 
kind of a grunting dissertation and somewhat of a

14:51.585 --> 15:03.606
nasal twang at the same time. I told him, yes, I 
realize that, and he wanted to know if I had an

15:04.379 --> 15:29.442
explanation for it, and of course I had an 
explanation for it, working till 1 or 1.30 in the

15:04.379 --> 15:29.442
morning, three nights a week, and going out, 
living in the basement of one of the old, old homes

15:04.379 --> 15:29.442
in Bryan at the time, and there was about six boys 
living in the basement of that old home, and I'd go

15:04.379 --> 15:29.442
home at 1.30 in the morning, and decide I was going 
to study, and needless to say, about 10 to 15

15:30.451 --> 15:37.559
minutes, and I'd be nodding and pointless to make 
any further efforts. And I'd say, well, I'll get up

15:37.619 --> 15:40.963
early in the morning and study. This never 
happened. I'd be late catching a bus from Bryan to

15:44.006 --> 15:47.510
campus to make it to class. So he persuaded me that 
I'd better discontinue my work at the Shulman

15:47.530 --> 15:53.557
Theater. So post haste, I resigned my position 
there. imposed further upon Mr. Hartsby to find a

15:58.700 --> 16:06.157
job on campus, which wound up being in the 
Landscape Arts Department. Which was kind of a

16:08.101 --> 16:11.228
deceiving thing, also.

16:12.852 --> 16:16.540
He told me, you go over to that red building over 
there next to the laundry, and says, I asked for a

16:16.992 --> 16:18.514
certain individual. I don't recall his name now. I 
said, you go into that building. I said, he'll find

16:21.537 --> 16:23.199
a job for you. I had visions of grandeur on my way 
over to this red building next to the laundry.

16:28.024 --> 16:28.985
Landscape art. I envisioned myself working at a 
table and designing flower beds and working with

16:29.005 --> 16:37.375
this shrub and that tree and such and that. And I 
walked into the red building next to the laundry,

16:37.415 --> 16:41.059
and there was nothing in there but Grubbing holes, 
shovels, axes, wheelbarrows. It suddenly hits

16:44.469 --> 16:46.352
you, right? And then on Saturday afternoons, of 
course, there were very few people working in the

16:46.472 --> 16:53.482
landscape arts department. About three of us 
showed up for work Saturday afternoon. This was

16:57.247 --> 17:04.718
during the time that football was being played, 
and I was an avid football fan even at that point in

16:57.247 --> 17:04.718
time. I would be standing there washing pots, and 
you could hear the screams coming from Kyle's

17:05.508 --> 17:10.334
field. It was hard. It was pretty tough. I'd been 
working for 35 cents an hour and missing a football

17:12.636 --> 17:15.700
game. But one thing led to another, and I wound up 
with a better job after that. And your grades

17:22.908 --> 17:23.869
picked up? My grades picked up, needless to say. I 
managed to stay in school, thanks to Dr.

17:26.573 --> 17:33.000
Marsteller.

17:34.027 --> 17:38.993
So that's about my transition from a farm boy to the 
College of Veterinary Medicine. And you got your

17:39.914 --> 17:41.056
degree when? In 46. February 46. And then what did 
you do with that degree? Well, let's see. You had to

17:49.827 --> 17:58.318
fill in on the Army Specialized Training Program 
and enroll in veterinary medicine. Charlie and I

17:58.358 --> 18:00.000
both were. participating in the Army Specialized 
Training Program. That lasted for only one year,

18:04.704 --> 18:14.556
and those of us that were not near enough 
graduation were given reserve officer's

18:04.704 --> 18:14.556
commission. Given the M.A.C., Medical 
Administrative. The Medical Administrative

18:17.479 --> 18:27.591
Corps, classified as second lieutenants, and 
were permitted to finish veterinary school. Now

18:28.567 --> 18:31.656
you technically never were under the G.I. Bill as 
such. No. This was that special training program.

18:36.551 --> 18:37.112
The G.I. Bill didn't come into being until after 
World War II and quite some time after, wasn't it

18:37.132 --> 18:43.150
Charlie? I don't think it was. I don't remember 
either. I was thinking 47, 48. About 48, 49, one old

18:48.651 --> 18:51.814
building. When the impact really hit. And they had 
some of that at the air basement, some on campus.

18:57.319 --> 19:01.482
The organized return of the bedroom was good on the 
Hazelwood building. That's the thing you're

19:01.502 --> 19:03.624
talking about, GI building. Yeah, right. Yeah, 
Hazelwood building. I checked that day. I never

19:07.348 --> 19:08.068
thought about it. I was thinking it was about 47, 48 
at least. Yeah, probably so. Well, this thing was a

19:14.213 --> 19:26.108
deal that you entered as a private when we went to 
Fort Sam and then after spending a month over there

19:14.213 --> 19:26.108
close on the railroad route, we were sent back 
here. They had a Marine Corps and a Navy. Air Corps.

19:30.713 --> 19:33.537
Air Corps. Medics, yeah. Specialized on 
specialized training. Lived over in the new area.

19:40.665 --> 19:42.027
Don't hate nothing at all. As a result of the Speed 
Up program, going summers and all, they had three

19:42.614 --> 19:49.783
graduating classes a year. In 46, we graduated 
three classes. I called myself a member of the

19:54.408 --> 19:59.274
advanced class in 46. I finished February the 2nd 
of 46, and there was a graduating class in June and

19:59.294 --> 20:05.922
one in August. four to six, retarded classes.

20:12.359 --> 20:21.491
And at that time, graduation, well, I joined my 
uncle and Dan Beckley, who had graduated about

20:12.359 --> 20:21.491
three years before me. It was with my uncle in ,, 
Texas. OK, so you went in practice with this uncle

20:24.775 --> 20:27.799
that you had? Yeah, with my non-graduate but 
licensed veterinarian uncle. Hillary Crenshaw.

20:37.406 --> 20:38.206
At Garland? At Garland.

20:42.750 --> 21:02.568
He had a booming large animal practice and just a 
piddling bit of small animal practice, which we

20:42.750 --> 21:02.568
conducted, the surgery we did, we did in a cheap 
metal garage that backed the wagons or trailers or

20:42.750 --> 21:02.568
whatever out of the garage and had a little surgery 
table set up in there. That's where we did our small

21:02.588 --> 21:04.630
animal practice. And he still had his Palomino 
Quarter horses and they were fine animals that

21:05.723 --> 21:18.337
provided me my introduction to artificial 
insemination, I guess. It just thrilled him when

21:18.477 --> 21:23.622
he had two mares come in at one time for breeding to 
his stag. He'd breed one mare and he'd take a

21:24.623 --> 21:34.414
gelatin capsule and go in and harvest a portion of 
the semen that had been ejaculated in the vagina of

21:24.623 --> 21:34.414
the mare and implant the and another mayor. That's 
surprisingly good. Is that right? Was that being

21:40.470 --> 21:44.075
done commonly, or is that something he picked up? I 
don't know how commonly it was being done. I don't

21:46.439 --> 21:52.167
remember he got the idea, but he was doing it quite 
commonly. This old stallion was pretty popular,

21:53.125 --> 21:58.712
and you were getting a lot of calls for service to 
it. Ptoleminos were popular at that time, and

21:58.833 --> 22:03.238
quarter horses were popular, gaining 
popularity. Yeah, and artificial insemination

22:03.258 --> 22:16.736
just coming along, because I had a dairy cow 
heifer, and we used to get people up from LSU to come

22:03.258 --> 22:16.736
inseminate the cow, because she was such a terror 
anyway with the bull. But it was apparently kind of

22:16.756 --> 22:20.922
a novel thing at the time. So you were in practice in 
Garland, and you're still heavily large animal.

22:25.336 --> 22:26.397
Heavily large animal. Right. And I really enjoyed 
the large animal work. I really had very little

22:29.941 --> 22:33.184
introduction to small animal. Back in school, we 
had very little. That was the right next question.

22:36.968 --> 22:42.374
Both of you, when you were here, was there any 
emphasis at all on small animal or sort of

22:36.968 --> 22:42.374
incidental? I would say no emphasis. What did you 
say? It was just available whenever we came in. You

22:49.724 --> 22:52.308
know, as students, there weren't any dogs. All 
dogs were neutered three miles from the campus.

22:55.352 --> 22:57.355
But there were students who could catch one 
running free. That was an opportunity to spay or

22:57.775 --> 23:01.100
cast or anything. If we were in my office, I'd show 
you a book that was really our only textbook in

23:01.320 --> 23:10.373
small animal, dogs and cats. And it's just about 
that thick. And it's a well-worn book. I'm going to

23:14.579 --> 23:15.660
get the time of that. I'll tell you before I leave. 
Don't even forget it. Because that's good. And, of

23:19.643 --> 23:21.886
course, now... Is that Brumley's? Yeah. Is that 
Brumley's? Would you like me to go get that now

23:27.253 --> 23:30.637
while you're making your note here on that? Okay. 
All right. Yeah, because those kind of pieces of

23:31.098 --> 23:36.025
information are pretty good to have. Because one 
thing I know I picked up in the veterinary chapter,

23:36.065 --> 23:44.756
medicine chapter I did at A&M, were the three or 
four titles of books. And there just wasn't much,

23:44.776 --> 23:48.541
you know, when Francis came in from the 30th 
century. I came back... I came back in the summer.

23:51.708 --> 23:54.055
We had a mid-summer conference, a mid-year 
conference. We called it the June conference. We

23:56.121 --> 23:57.185
met at the MSC on campus. And I remember buying a 
poetry pathology book, Beasters. Oh, it was about

24:01.848 --> 24:04.291
that thick. It was tremendous. The book that we had 
was a bartered card. It was about this thick, about

24:06.994 --> 24:10.458
in that big square, I think. And Banks, Dr. Banks, 
used to laugh about, well, there were only five

24:10.478 --> 24:18.027
diseases of poultry when we were in school. Yeah, 
probably so. Yeah, now you've got everything in

24:18.807 --> 24:20.549
the world. Root, collar, bubble foot. We really 
got more in poultry than we did in small animals,

24:22.532 --> 24:27.197
dogs and cats. I wouldn't be surprised, yeah, 
commercial, because Folter would have been

24:27.920 --> 24:33.426
heavily commercial-wise already. That's right. 
It was a plot treatment deal. I've always, of

24:38.511 --> 24:43.857
course I'm a book person anyway, but I've always 
been intrigued by the textbook things. There was

24:43.917 --> 24:48.281
one on the horse, somebody on the horse, it was a 
classic. I went to the library, we had it in the

24:48.301 --> 24:56.610
library, in fact, 1880 vintage thing, and 
apparently it was still used in the 20th century.

24:57.687 --> 25:03.653
Well, Keeping Livestock Healthy in 1942 was about 
the biggest general book we had. Do you remember?

25:04.815 --> 25:06.777
You wrote your representative who got that one. 
Oh, yeah, yeah. Old E. Butler called me one day when

25:08.499 --> 25:13.945
he was going to testify on Bruce Loveson for 
Comedian Austin. I can't find my Keeping

25:13.965 --> 25:16.367
Livestock Healthy book. I want to borrow yours. 
Well, they put that out annually for many years.

25:19.991 --> 25:21.693
Oh, yeah. I got one about four years ago. It had even 
colored plates in it. Then they had one on the

25:26.392 --> 25:29.797
diseases of the horse and the diseases of cattle. 
Those were two broken down bodies after that 40

25:29.837 --> 25:34.124
years. I used to have clients that would want me to 
get them books on diseases of cattle. Always. And

25:38.832 --> 25:43.038
I'd tell them about keeping livestock healthy. 
That was a constant. And where's a good book I can

25:45.562 --> 25:47.626
get them? I don't know. I had one that pestered me 
about that. A young man, he was college educated,

25:51.651 --> 25:55.196
kept pestering me about books. And I finally gave 
him my book on the diseases of cattle, the Saunders

25:55.337 --> 26:01.266
publication. And he took that thing home. He 
brought it back in about a week, something like

26:05.052 --> 26:07.375
that. He always smoked a cigar. And he walked into 
that cigar in the mouth and said, keep that damn

26:08.998 --> 26:13.144
thing. He said, everything in there sounds alike.

26:19.852 --> 26:22.075
So how long were you in practice now at Garland? 
Well, I practiced there for 10 months, and for some

26:22.095 --> 26:34.635
reason Uncle Sam thought that as a result of my year 
in the Army Specialized Training Program that I

26:22.095 --> 26:34.635
still owed them some time as a veterinarian. So I 
thought they were bluffing. They sent me an

26:38.501 --> 26:44.290
opportunity to sign up as a... That's what they 
were going in as at that time. And I declined. Then I

26:50.174 --> 26:54.198
got a draft notice and time to report. So I 
post-haste went into Dallas and made application

26:54.238 --> 27:01.486
to enter as an officer in the veterinary corps. 
That was close. And the day I was to report for my

27:03.028 --> 27:09.855
physical for the draft, my commission came 
through in the veterinary corps. So I

27:10.747 --> 27:15.972
was being like C.K. Jones, who did time as a buck 
private in Fort Sam Houston, Texas, and he can tell

27:15.992 --> 27:23.120
you some wild stories about that. Of course, being 
a Texas A&M graduate, he was well-versed in

27:23.180 --> 27:35.252
treatment of equine diseases, horses and mules, 
and they had quite a contingent of mules down there

27:23.180 --> 27:35.252
in particular. And the veterinarians on duty at 
Fort Brown were all from the northeast and they

27:35.975 --> 27:41.808
didn't know anything about it. They'd bring a mule 
into the clinic there and ask to see case. I guess

27:49.998 --> 27:52.000
they called him private. I think he was first 
class. Did he make first class? I don't know. I

27:55.724 --> 27:57.026
haven't heard this story. Ask him. What's wrong 
with this mule for $54 a month? I don't know what the

27:59.589 --> 28:02.793
hell happened to that mule. Turn around and walk 
off. You know how independent he was. It still is.

28:07.338 --> 28:08.879
So how long were you in service now? Well, I was in 
two years. Okay. And your station? Well, I spent

28:12.363 --> 28:14.706
about... three months at Chicago, two months in 
Chicago, I guess. And most of the people that went

28:20.149 --> 28:25.799
in to Chicago went through their meat and dairy 
hygiene school. I didn't have that opportunity.

28:28.744 --> 28:38.500
They had officers at Fort Sill, Oklahoma that were 
being mustered out and had a colonel there that I

28:38.800 --> 28:53.963
was rather impatient to have some officers 
underneath him, you know, do the paperwork and

28:38.800 --> 28:53.963
running around the meat inspection and all that 
sort of thing, so they cut me some orders to go to

28:38.800 --> 28:53.963
Fort Sill instead of going to the meat and dairy 
hygiene school. In some ways, a major in Chicago

28:55.165 --> 29:00.133
lost my orders. and were later found on his desk and 
had been there for just about five weeks. So I was

29:06.816 --> 29:21.209
five weeks late getting to Fort Selle, Oklahoma, 
just bumming around in the Quartermaster Corps

29:06.816 --> 29:21.209
offices up there and such as that, reported to a 
very irate colonel at Lawton, Oklahoma. And he

29:22.811 --> 29:30.998
took me down to the, well, the first afternoon I got 
in there, we immediately went down to this cooler

29:22.811 --> 29:30.998
for the Quartermaster Corps he took me in the 
cooler there and wanted me to tell him which of

29:31.332 --> 29:38.990
these is a steer carcass and which is a heifer 
carcass and I had no idea. I couldn't even tell male

29:39.712 --> 29:44.924
from a female carcass and he was just furious. I 
mean he was rabid. Colonel Wiseman, They sent him a

29:48.680 --> 29:53.064
greenhorn like that. You couldn't tell a male from 
a female. I knew nothing about looking for the

29:56.227 --> 30:00.090
pizzle eye to distinguish. This was where the 
penis muscle, the retractor muscle of the penis

30:00.491 --> 30:04.935
attached on the pelvis. There was no distinction 
between male and female carcass. No one told me

30:09.739 --> 30:11.400
anything about that. Did we have that in school 
Charlie? Did I miss that? No, no.

30:18.835 --> 30:28.845
But anyway, I was at Fort Sill for about six months, 
I guess, and then they transferred me to Fort Sam in

30:18.835 --> 30:28.845
San Antonio. And I was doing most of the meat 
inspection work. Well, at Fort Sill, I also was

30:35.792 --> 30:43.240
involved in the small animal clinic that rendered 
veterinary services to military personnel in the

30:43.658 --> 30:45.921
Lofton area. That provided me really my first 
exposure to small animal medicine. And it was very

30:53.192 --> 30:55.896
interesting. I found it really intriguing. We had 
a nice clinic set up there. And then when I went to

31:01.785 --> 31:10.818
Fort Sam, we had a real nice veterinary clinic 
there where we treated both large and small

31:01.785 --> 31:10.818
animals. It had an awful lot of horses. at Fort Sam. 
And one of my most interesting experiences there

31:16.561 --> 31:27.498
involved

31:16.561 --> 31:27.498
Colonel Wainwright, Skinny Wainwright, the 
Death March. He was there at the Fourth Army

31:28.660 --> 31:40.378
headquarters in San Antonio, and he had about four 
of his jumping horses that he kept on the post

31:28.660 --> 31:40.378
there. Of course, we saw about their health needs 
at the veterinary clinic. And they called us one

31:46.239 --> 31:57.437
morning about his favorite jumping horse, Once 
Again was his name, having colic. And I went out and

31:57.457 --> 32:03.767
encountered the sergeant that was presenting him 
with his colic. Colonel Wyatt, who was commanding

32:04.439 --> 32:20.882
officer of 4th Army Headquarters at the time, and 
was head of the post hospital, veterinary

32:04.439 --> 32:20.882
hospital, he came out and took over Mr. Kenny 
Wainwright's horse. He thought that most colling

32:20.902 --> 32:31.797
cases are rather simple to treat, and some of them 
even self-resolving, but boy, if they're not,

32:20.902 --> 32:31.797
you've got really trouble on your hands. Well, 
fortunately for me, Colonel White took over. And

32:36.670 --> 32:44.081
needless to say, the bottom line, General 
Wainwright's horse once again became never more.

32:44.421 --> 32:45.383
Oh, boy. I'm so glad for you.

32:50.811 --> 32:54.296
So that was another close call you had there. 
Somebody's looking over me, I guess. Okay, then

33:00.105 --> 33:01.767
how did you, excuse me, go ahead. Well, I guess 
while I was at Fort Sam, I came in, well, I attended

33:03.080 --> 33:16.393
the local veterinary meetings, which

33:03.080 --> 33:16.393
enabled me to see a real transition in organized 
veterinary medicine, I guess. Of course, we'd

33:16.413 --> 33:18.315
just been through the war years. I'd go to the San 
Antonio or Bexar County Veterinary Association

33:19.556 --> 33:31.247
meeting, and there wouldn't be maybe five or six 
veterinarians there.

33:31.700 --> 33:41.893
Looking around San Antonio, it looked attractive 
to my wife and I, and I was scouting it out as a

33:31.700 --> 33:41.893
potential site to practice after getting out of 
the service. I actually located a boarding kennel

33:43.856 --> 34:01.318
that they had for sale, a real nice facility, and I 
saw this as having potential to be converted into a

33:43.856 --> 34:01.318
veterinary clinic and hospitalizing facilities 
with the warrants and cages and runs that they have

33:43.856 --> 34:01.318
there. But we had our first child born there. The 
baby was 13 days old. My wife died from a spinal

34:11.644 --> 34:16.310
injection. It was kind of a real fiasco in the 
medical profession, I guess. It was kind of an

34:23.899 --> 34:29.787
enlightening thing that you could encounter 
mistakes and mishaps in the medical field. I may be

34:31.737 --> 34:41.686
a little prouder of the veterinary profession, 
but individuals are all going to make mistakes in

34:31.737 --> 34:41.686
regards to what they're training in the field that 
they're in. But as a result of that, my mother was

34:41.706 --> 34:56.540
just real anxious to raise my baby, so she came up 
and took my baby home to Westwood, to Ed Couch,

34:41.706 --> 34:56.540
actually. And I had about another six months to do, 
in the service before I was discharged. And so when

35:05.256 --> 35:13.905
I was discharged, I went back to the Valley and 
started to practice in Washington,

35:05.256 --> 35:13.905
Texas. So that's how I wound up back at home doing 
practice. I'd always heard in school that it's not

35:18.650 --> 35:28.140
wise to go back to your hometown and practice with 
your friends or the factory service. You'd always

35:28.913 --> 35:38.703
be little Elmo and lack the respect that you might 
have if you were in the new community and starting

35:28.913 --> 35:38.703
over fresh and all that. But I didn't find that to be 
true. I found my friends being very receptive to me

35:41.826 --> 35:47.371
as a veterinarian. And I don't think any of them 
expected free service or anything of that nature.

35:54.278 --> 35:57.621
I think I might have been somewhat of a 
humanitarian. I never charged exorbitant fees. I

36:00.462 --> 36:02.824
think my fees were always very reasonable, I 
guess. I kind of operated on the philosophy of get

36:04.546 --> 36:13.594
them for a dollar many times instead of ten dollars 
once or something. I did practice at a reasonable

36:14.835 --> 36:18.298
fee. One thing that might have influenced that, 
there was a practitioner at Westaco that, while I

36:18.318 --> 36:26.325
was growing up, Much better businessman than I 
was, I guess. He got really exorbitant fees for a

36:28.888 --> 36:35.355
lot of his services, but really didn't render a 
whole lot of service. And this made the climate

36:35.635 --> 36:42.143
there very good for me as a new veterinarian in the 
community. Just be on the job, render good

36:42.163 --> 36:47.349
service, and collect reasonable fees. I know I've 
raised this question several times in some other

36:47.369 --> 36:54.557
conversations about how do you decide what kind of 
feed or to charge, and there's no good answer, I

36:54.875 --> 36:57.879
gather. Well, no, it depends a lot on the 
clientele, where you are and what, of course, the

36:58.661 --> 37:15.365
Rio Grande Valley has never been populated with a 
lot of wealthy people or even well-to-do people.

37:15.525 --> 37:16.887
It's kind of a poverty area. At the present time, 
there's about 28% unemployment in the valley

37:16.907 --> 37:23.717
area. And those people have pay-ups, and they need 
veterinary services, so that has an influence on

37:24.473 --> 37:33.384
what some of your charges might be. But I practice 
some socialized veterinary medicine to an

37:34.225 --> 37:38.511
extent. I charge more for people that I thought 
could afford it. I'd look out in the parking lot and

37:42.015 --> 37:45.079
see what they were riding around in. But I never had 
anyone throw my hand at me.

37:53.414 --> 37:55.236
So how long were you in practice now? 22 years. 22 
years. OK, so both of you really had a long private

37:57.860 --> 38:02.666
practice before you came into academia. I didn't 
realize how many people change at 17 years. That's

38:07.333 --> 38:08.034
interesting. I met those people that came here to 
the faculty and others. In about 15, 17 years, you

38:11.739 --> 38:14.362
do something. That's interesting. Now, how did 
you make that transition? And then let's go back to

38:21.832 --> 38:23.874
your practice days, Anthony. I don't know. I had, I 
think, as good a mixed practice as it was in the

38:25.657 --> 38:33.206
state of Texas, and I enjoyed it thoroughly. And 
about three years before I came up here, I bought an

38:33.226 --> 38:49.105
excellent piece of property just halfway between 
West Dakota and Mercedes at the intersection of

38:33.226 --> 38:49.105
the main highway up and down the valley and a road 
that goes down to Mexico. and remodeled this

38:49.507 --> 38:57.455
furniture showroom that had been vacant for 
probably 12, 15 years. And I bought it worth the

38:58.456 --> 39:10.248
price and remodeled it for a mixed practice at 
facilities for large and small animals, both all

38:58.456 --> 39:10.248
under one roof. And I had, I think, an unusual large 
animal practice. Probably 75% of my large animal

39:17.182 --> 39:23.367
practice was made up of registered Charolais 
cattle. And during the years that I was in practice

39:24.508 --> 39:34.517
there, value escalated to the point that I think it 
was ridiculous that some of the prices they were

39:24.508 --> 39:34.517
getting for it. I had some terrible $50,000 cows in 
my practice. And I don't mean that's the value they

39:39.982 --> 39:43.705
placed on them or hadn't insured for them. That's 
what they paid for them. It might have been a matter

39:47.185 --> 39:56.294
of, well, you buy my two $50,000 cows this year, and 
I'll buy your $100,000 bull next year, or

39:47.185 --> 39:56.294
something like that. I don't know whether that 
went on or not, but there was quite a bit of movement

39:56.334 --> 40:03.540
between herds of valuable animals like that. And

40:05.062 --> 40:16.112
I had about 10 stalls for large animals, and most of 
these stalls were kept full all the time first

40:17.189 --> 40:26.819
calf, charlotte heifers, or cows that had 
dystopia problems a year before, and they brought

40:17.189 --> 40:26.819
them in for us to calve out. So your income is coming 
from large animals, hybrid stock practice? Well,

40:34.006 --> 40:42.775
for about two years, the last two years of my 
practice, for the first time ever, I guess, my

40:34.006 --> 40:42.775
large animal practice money-wise, was about 60 
percent of my practice in small ammo and 40

40:43.379 --> 40:50.048
percent. Whereas throughout the 22 years I was 
there, probably my practice was about 60 percent

40:50.068 --> 40:57.658
small and 44 percent large. That really was a good 
mixed practice then, okay. Because of the

41:01.483 --> 41:07.311
interest in Charolais cattle and one of the 
original importers of the Charolais breed, Fred

41:01.483 --> 41:07.311
Turner, headquarters was just about five miles 
south of my office, right near the rear ground. And

41:14.381 --> 41:17.324
he really populated the whole valley with 
Charolais cats. So I had a lot of breeders that made

41:18.165 --> 41:33.980
excellent clients because they were willing to 
spend money for diagnostics on the individual

41:18.165 --> 41:33.980
animal and money for treatment of the individual 
animal, not just a herd health type practice. And I

41:34.081 --> 41:36.002
enjoyed that aspect of it. I liked it. 
responsibility for the individual animal but i

41:36.603 --> 42:04.062
had a i'd hired a an old bachelor friend of mine in 
fact he was a friend of my parents before i was even

41:36.603 --> 42:04.062
born or before they were even married that 
operated dairy for many years down there then he

41:36.603 --> 42:04.062
sold his dairy out and retired from daring and i 
hired him to live in an apartment that i had right in

41:36.603 --> 42:04.062
the center of my clinic building We put a window in 
one wall that looked out over the stalls where we

42:04.295 --> 42:10.521
kept these cows for freshening.

42:12.923 --> 42:18.909
He was very knowledgeable about cattle and about 
birthing calves and that sort of thing. It was his

42:19.889 --> 42:22.272
responsibility, just the night work. He slept in 
the daytime and ran the clinic at night, you might

42:22.292 --> 42:26.656
say. He would call one of us. I had a partner at the 
time, Dr. Larry Doosan. And he'd call us. We'd

42:36.097 --> 42:37.358
alternate night duty. Is he still around? Yes, 
he's still around. I feel like I've almost met him.

42:42.343 --> 42:43.505
His name is down there. He's on the board of 
examiners. His name has come up where I met him one

42:48.010 --> 42:49.812
or the other. I can't remember. But I found this to 
be a rather burdening responsibility to have

42:51.974 --> 42:59.462
responsibility to these people. valuable cows. 
Half a million bucks in your backyard. We did a

43:02.658 --> 43:05.742
whole lot of C-sections. Cows are just like women. 
They prefer to deliver at 2 or 3 o'clock in the

43:07.264 --> 43:12.251
morning instead of 2 or 3 o'clock in the afternoon. 
Is that right, Charlie? It just seems that's a

43:13.793 --> 43:17.798
night event for cattle. And I don't know whether 
it's the pressures of the practice or what, but I

43:26.307 --> 43:32.012
got to the point that I couldn't get up in the middle 
of the night and go out and make a call and go back and

43:26.307 --> 43:32.012
go to sleep. I was awake and I was awake for the rest 
of the night. You were getting in a stressful

43:35.015 --> 43:37.156
situation. I don't know. My wife probably 
detected the pressures that I was under. Really,

43:44.863 --> 43:47.706
she wasn't happy in the Valley either. She wanted 
to make a move. I was willing to kind of make a career

43:52.009 --> 43:56.213
change or at least try it. And I first mentioned 
this to Dr. Al Price at the Fort Worth meeting, that

43:56.733 --> 44:04.984
I was contemplating a career change. I thought 
more of regulatory work than I did of academia. At

44:10.532 --> 44:14.357
the time, I thought I'd been out of school too long 
to get back into academics. It just hadn't entered

44:16.380 --> 44:17.742
my mind. But I guess Al mentioned to Bill Romaine on 
some occasion that I was thinking doing something

44:26.618 --> 44:29.041
besides continuing practice. Bill Romaine came 
to the valley in about March, I think, of 71. He and

44:36.291 --> 44:46.344
Ken Knauer came down there for a golfing foray, and 
Bill gave us a program with large animals and Ken

44:36.291 --> 44:46.344
Knauer on small animals. It happened to be Ken's 
first seminar presentation. I think he'd been on

44:49.929 --> 44:56.237
faculty here about three years, but it was his 
first presentation to a group of veterinarians.

44:58.175 --> 45:05.882
And Bill mentioned to me on that occasion that Al 
had said something to him about how he was going to

44:58.175 --> 45:05.882
make a career change. He asked me about coming up 
here and if I'd be interested. And I said, well, I

45:13.069 --> 45:17.473
haven't thought about it, but yes, I'd be 
interested. I thought, oh, that sounds much

45:17.493 --> 45:20.495
better than regulatory work.

45:23.858 --> 45:25.600
More prestigious, to say the least. He said he 
didn't have a position at the time, but he'd be

45:27.453 --> 45:33.201
interested in talking with me if the position came 
up. So I kind of marked it off. There was no further

45:35.264 --> 45:36.345
talk. About another six weeks later, Nick 
Callaham called and said they had a position up

45:37.987 --> 45:43.615
here. I wanted to know if I wanted to come up and talk 
about it. He said, we're going to have to have this

45:48.361 --> 45:50.885
thing filled pretty quickly. He said, you need to 
get up here pretty soon. Well, I think I came up

45:52.607 --> 45:55.631
about a week later, something like that. Oh, is 
that right? And then the position was not in large

45:57.794 --> 46:02.360
animals. They still didn't have a position in 
large animals. I wound up talking with Ned Elliott

46:05.524 --> 46:12.632
and meeting the small animal faculty and getting a 
tour of their facilities. I actually was offered a

46:14.415 --> 46:16.597
position. I didn't even ask at that time what it 
paid or what's going to be my grant. Is that right?

46:25.028 --> 46:25.168
Uh-huh. So I begged a few days to make my decision to 
go back and make arrangements with my partner and

46:25.891 --> 46:37.804
discuss it with my wife and decided to make the 
change. I thought it was probably a time for six

46:37.824 --> 46:45.873
months or a year, but I had a practice that I was 
thoroughly enjoying those aspects of it. Yeah,

46:45.933 --> 46:49.076
you used a little rest and recuperation. Right. 
Yeah. But I thought I'd come back for a little

46:51.372 --> 46:56.260
retraining, kind of a sabbatical from practice or 
something. But it turned out to be a permanent

46:57.062 --> 47:02.491
position, and one that the transition that 
frankly wasn't easy to make. It took me about two

47:02.511 --> 47:07.260
years to adjust to the academic environment. I 
don't know. They don't... I want to ask you both

47:09.784 --> 47:11.286
about that, too. Yeah. Well, they... I was kind of 
on my own, it looked like. I wasn't given any

47:16.712 --> 47:24.445
specific responsibilities, classes to teach or, 
well, for four months. You were just here. I

47:26.789 --> 47:28.272
graduated at that time in September. Is that 
right, Charles? Pardon? Graduating at that time

47:30.435 --> 47:34.342
in September or August. August, I believe. Huh? I 
believe it was August. And I came here June 1st.
