WEBVTT

00:01.246 --> 00:27.053
land use, as I was saying, Project Ag updating all 
the land use, Jonathan had decided that he wanted

00:01.246 --> 00:27.053
to move into the area what we would refer to as 
developing planning areas for the city and sector

00:01.246 --> 00:27.053
planning, and then assigning various personnel 
as area planners to work under the senior planner

00:01.246 --> 00:27.053
in charge of advanced planning at that time. Who 
was that? That was Bill Pearson. And

00:29.992 --> 00:36.061
it took a little time to get started. It was mainly 
set up after what had been happening in Fort Worth.

00:44.574 --> 00:54.810
And I don't recall the date, but during this 
period, it also brought down from Fort Worth

00:44.574 --> 00:54.810
Emilio Once-DeVise, who became our senior 
planner. And of course, as you know, Emilio is now

00:55.685 --> 00:59.909
back with the city of Fort Worth again. So things 
have a way of making a circle. During that interim

01:05.214 --> 01:20.028
of trying to set up the sector planning at that 
time, one of the new programs the federal

01:05.214 --> 01:20.028
government was sponsoring was the Community 
Renewal Program under the Department of Housing

01:05.214 --> 01:20.028
and Urban Development. And of course, the 
Community Renewal Program had become the

01:20.248 --> 01:25.573
planning forerunner to what would ultimately 
hope to be the passing of an urban renewal

01:26.515 --> 01:31.602
referendum, which never did happen. And when the 
Community Renewal Program was set up, they were

01:32.964 --> 01:46.162
located at some administrative offices situated 
in Washington Park Zoo, which was subject of many

01:32.964 --> 01:46.162
jokes. And Mr. Bill Adams, the Assistant Director 
of Planning under Jonathan, took a leave of

01:53.853 --> 01:58.460
absence from that position to become the director 
of the community road program. And of course, Mr.

01:58.781 --> 02:02.807
Adams brought in Kern Ewing as his assistant 
director. And Kern is the person, the reason I

02:03.608 --> 02:12.442
mention him, he is the person who eventually 
caused my relocation to the city of Corpus

02:03.608 --> 02:12.442
Christi. If everyone recalls, community road 
programs were primarily set up for funding on two

02:14.365 --> 02:22.037
to three year basis. And as the CRP, as it's known, 
was about to close down in the city of El Paso, Kern

02:22.523 --> 02:36.279
had accepted a job to head up the Community Rule 
Program for the city of Corpus Christi. And I

02:36.299 --> 02:38.602
believe that occurred in 1971.

02:42.486 --> 02:51.737
And after about two years with the program,

02:42.486 --> 02:51.737
Kern, basically the program, the Community Rule 
Program, in Corpus was first to set up a data bank

02:52.325 --> 03:06.061
for both land uses and other kinds of 
socioeconomic information to do an economic

02:52.325 --> 03:06.061
study of the city of Corpus Christi. And from 
there, it was intended to lead into

03:06.782 --> 03:20.138
identification of the most severely blighted 
areas, areas which would be identified as future

03:06.782 --> 03:20.138
urban renewal areas.

03:21.586 --> 03:35.305
At about that time, so the emphasis of the 
community renewal programs, as it had been with

03:21.586 --> 03:35.305
many other CRPs across the state, was the 
accumulation of socioeconomic type of data. Now,

03:35.325 --> 03:43.897
if I can regress backwards, under Jonathan 
Cunningham, Jonathan Cunningham, in my opinion,

03:35.325 --> 03:43.897
was a traditionalist type of planner. He was very 
physical planning oriented, and not only that, he

03:44.558 --> 03:51.407
was a very good manipulator in terms of working his 
projects his projects and the various political

03:51.927 --> 04:12.197
processes with tremendous success, never taking 
credit primarily for the projects that were

03:51.927 --> 04:12.197
completed as his own, but somehow convincing 
other people within the community leadership

03:51.927 --> 04:12.197
that this was their idea and that they needed to 
follow through with it. Like the mayor and so

04:13.308 --> 04:14.629
forth. Like the mayor, your city council members 
are maybe one of the more affluent persons in some

04:14.649 --> 04:25.662
sort of community-wide organization. People who 
would have the leadership ability and the

04:25.682 --> 04:32.249
influence to move certain things. This must have 
made Jonathan a rather powerful person in

04:32.309 --> 04:38.556
government. For the time that I was in El Paso, 
Jonathan Cunningham, as I shortly found out, was

04:39.312 --> 04:53.407
in conjunction with the director of public works, 
George Deiter. Those two men were the most

04:53.968 --> 04:56.270
powerful. How do you spell his name? It's 
D-I-E-T-E-R. George Deiter and Jonathan were

04:57.611 --> 05:02.477
basically the runners. They ran the city. There 
wasn't anything that the council would do unless

05:03.718 --> 05:08.543
they unless Mr. Dieter and Mr. Cunningham had 
given their blessing to the project. And I don't

05:14.078 --> 05:20.504
recall how many years Jonathan was with El Paso, 
but I know it was over 30 years. And it's just

05:21.986 --> 05:37.821
amazing for a director of planning to develop that 
kind of

05:21.986 --> 05:37.821
power from his position and maintain it. over that 
length of period. And he used it wisely. There's a

05:43.896 --> 05:53.371
lot of related stories about Jonathan and how he 
ended up winning the budget wars as everyone went

05:43.896 --> 05:53.371
to the city council. You have to remember that the 
city of El Paso was and still is a strong mayor form

05:53.431 --> 06:00.923
of government.

06:02.000 --> 06:04.203
former council, former government. They had 
tried to attempt to change it over to a city manager

06:04.443 --> 06:10.570
type, but they as yet not succeeded. And in lieu of 
not having an officially appointed head of city

06:11.291 --> 06:25.227
government to manage the city's businesses as any 
other professional businessman would do, John

06:11.291 --> 06:25.227
Cunningham and George Dieter assumed that role. 
And it became very effective. I think John's

06:29.455 --> 06:58.635
demise as far as his power base was concerned began 
occurring with the retirement of George Deeder

06:29.455 --> 06:58.635
from his office and also the realization on the 
part of some politicians who I have known

06:29.455 --> 06:58.635
personally feeling that Mr. Cunningham had taken 
what had once been a very small department of

06:29.455 --> 06:58.635
planning and built it into a very powerful 
organization utilizing

06:59.847 --> 07:18.392
the advantages of

06:59.847 --> 07:18.392
grants available from the federal government, 
including such programs as you recall, open

06:59.847 --> 07:18.392
space, urban beautification, et cetera, your 701 
planning, community renewal planning, your

06:59.847 --> 07:18.392
relocation. And he just assumed control over all 
these projects and just expanded them and

07:19.194 --> 07:27.525
expanded the staff where that that one way or 
another anything that was done in the city of El

07:28.113 --> 07:36.862
Paso had to be brought back through the Department 
of Planning. That's the way it ought to be. But it

07:40.365 --> 07:40.986
was good. At the same time, Jonathan Cullingham 
was the single person in charge of that entire

07:41.006 --> 07:57.782
process and it made him very powerful and the 
politicians themselves were afraid of that. And

07:57.914 --> 08:23.820
although I had since departed, just from what I had 
read and heard from my colleagues back in El Paso,

07:57.914 --> 08:23.820
slowly but surely the politicians began to break 
down Mr. Cunningham's power base, splitting out a

07:57.914 --> 08:23.820
lot of the grants activities into other 
departments, such as the Community Development

07:57.914 --> 08:23.820
Bank grants, a lot of grants. which are very 
significant in terms of total dollars and impact

08:25.015 --> 08:32.545
on the community for physical improvements. But 
anyway, this is one of the amazing things about

08:33.926 --> 08:37.071
John. John had always been the type of 
professional planner with a management skill

08:37.311 --> 08:46.763
that tended to elevate his people that he was 
trying to teach. And for the most part, at the time I

08:47.584 --> 08:54.533
started, I was not even aware. of professional 
planning schools, etc., or never even thought of

08:54.766 --> 09:01.133
attending one. I had never even thought of staying 
on with the Department of Planning for more than

09:01.173 --> 09:06.298
one year. I had always intended to return to law 
school to finish that up. But I became very, so

09:10.843 --> 09:18.451
involved in planning and I enjoyed it so much, I 
just couldn't think of a better way to continue.

09:18.471 --> 09:19.812
You know, we could always look at the the money side 
of it and it was very apparent that you wouldn't get

09:22.002 --> 09:50.102
rich being a public service planner for any city 
but there were other kinds of benefits that that

09:22.002 --> 09:50.102
you enjoyed and other than civil service 
protection but the fact that you were actually

09:22.002 --> 09:50.102
having some impact on the community and how it was 
going to look and it carried with it a lot of respect

09:22.002 --> 09:50.102
and and as you've moved further up the ladder a lot 
of responsibility After the community renewal

09:52.023 --> 10:08.449
program in the city of Corpus Christi had gotten 
well underway after those first two years, they

09:52.023 --> 10:08.449
had, for the most part, completed the collection 
of data that they needed, both demographic and

09:52.023 --> 10:08.449
socioeconomic. And they had also divided the city 
up into planning areas. So they could aggregate

10:13.918 --> 10:17.664
their data for planning areas and set up a land use 
data bank. And they had done a condition of housing

10:19.748 --> 10:25.794
condition of structure survey city-wide, and 
they were ready to move into some more physical

10:19.748 --> 10:25.794
aspects of planning. And at that time, Kern Ewing 
had written me a letter and followed up a phone call

10:26.595 --> 10:40.489
one day asking if I would be interested in coming 
down here and being, starting as a planner one,

10:26.595 --> 10:40.489
coming out here and working on planning. I did fail 
to mention that as the community renewal program

10:41.129 --> 10:47.916
in El Paso was beginning to fade out, phase out, lot 
of the personnel that they had there on the program

10:48.554 --> 11:16.806
have been finding other jobs and rightfully so 
they they you know they they knew that the program

10:48.554 --> 11:16.806
only had several months to a wife left into a 
budgetary life anyway and i was temporarily

10:48.554 --> 11:16.806
reassigned from the downtown planning offices to 
the washington zoo to assist kern ewing and bill

10:48.554 --> 11:16.806
adams and a couple other staff able to finish off to 
wrap up the CRP. And our program there at that time,

11:19.574 --> 11:37.893
the wrap-up was doing, on a very small scale, 
neighborhood plans for each one of the, I think it

11:19.574 --> 11:37.893
was 13 to 14 neighborhoods that we identified as 
needing, in dire need of some type of urban

11:19.574 --> 11:37.893
renewal. And which all these same reports were 
published in some volumes. These are the volumes

11:42.672 --> 11:46.278
up here, a culmination of that entire project. 
There's five volumes there. One thing you can

11:49.703 --> 11:59.599
never change charts or say about, one of the things 
you can always say about the federal government is

11:49.703 --> 11:59.599
they've never been lacking on paperwork. They're 
very impressive looking. But we had them out

12:01.562 --> 12:03.606
there. One of the questions that comes to mind is 
that in terms of Corpus Christi's community

12:03.906 --> 12:09.355
renewal effort, In view of the fact that Corpus 
Christi never did act upon the urban renewal

12:09.858 --> 12:31.646
aspects of the original Bartholomew plan, that 
must have suggested something in regard to

12:09.858 --> 12:31.646
community attitudes toward potential community 
renewal efforts. And I'm just wondering if that

12:31.666 --> 12:36.372
came to pass in the CRP program for Corpus Christi. 
Was it successful, do you think? It was never. I

12:39.677 --> 12:58.486
think the efforts of the Community Renewal 
Program, Corpus Christi, were very successful,

12:39.677 --> 12:58.486
but it didn't, not in having an immediate impact on 
the community or in convincing the community that

12:39.677 --> 12:58.486
we needed an urban renewal referendum and urban 
renewal agency. It didn't have that kind of

12:58.506 --> 13:00.389
immediate impact. I think in the long run, the work 
that the staff members of CRP did had a lot of impact

13:07.098 --> 13:20.696
in providing the information that we as planners 
and the managerial staff needed to make

13:07.098 --> 13:20.696
decisions. And so I can't honestly say whether or 
not the total dollars spent in the community

13:20.716 --> 13:33.713
renewal program effort could be measured against 
its immediate impact if it would be worth it.

13:34.233 --> 13:35.835
That's really hard to say. But I can say, I think, 
very honestly, that the kind of work that was done

13:35.855 --> 14:03.649
with CRP, the fact that we, even though I'm more of a 
physical type of planner and a provisor of John

13:35.855 --> 14:03.649
Cunningham,

13:35.855 --> 14:03.649
I think one of the things I'd like to detail for you, 
and this is, in my opinion, my observation, the

14:04.878 --> 14:14.330
emphasis, the planning programs here in this 
city, this community of Corpus Christi, has taken

14:04.878 --> 14:14.330
over the last 10 years. And the changes that I have 
observed, drastic changes in the kinds of

14:14.990 --> 14:23.240
planning work that we do as a department. I'll back 
up a little bit. I joined the staff, community

14:25.884 --> 14:34.294
renewal program staff, March 19, 1973. So from 
that date, this March 19th, 1983, I had been here 10

14:34.797 --> 14:40.005
years. I came in for the sole purpose of developing 
for Kern Ewing, who was the director, and Leonard

14:42.348 --> 14:56.028
Jameson was assistant director, a comprehensive 
land use plan for the city of Corpus Christi. All

14:57.950 --> 15:03.859
the other work that goes into a comprehensive plan 
had, for the most part, been studied and detailed

15:04.109 --> 15:07.693
and information was available. I was talking 
about the socio-economic information, the

15:07.713 --> 15:11.536
community facilities, you know, et cetera. But 
they didn't have the total land use plan. I think

15:16.301 --> 15:18.603
it's in- Kern Ewing was planning director. Kern 
Ewing was the director. That's a good point. Kern

15:22.027 --> 15:24.649
Ewing was the director of the Community Renewal 
Program. The Community Renewal Program was a

15:26.391 --> 15:32.597
division of the Department of Urban Development, 
which was under a director by the name of Ernest

15:32.948 --> 15:37.192
Briones, now our deputy city manager.

15:39.855 --> 15:44.800
Well, let me say something about that 
organization. It was my understanding that at the

15:44.820 --> 16:01.757
time community rural program monies were being 
made available to urbanized areas, that Corpus,

15:44.820 --> 16:01.757
as it was in El Paso and many other cities, was 
invited to apply, and the money, based on the

15:44.820 --> 16:01.757
application, was granted to the city. Mr. 
Anderson, being the department head for the

16:06.306 --> 16:16.123
Department of Planning, was responsible for 
making sure that application was put together.

16:16.283 --> 16:22.334
Mr. Earl Gadds, Mr. Anderson's senior planner at 
that time, prepared the application. For the

16:23.996 --> 16:27.863
reasons I'm really hazy about, Mr. Goetz did not 
desire to be the acting director of the community

16:28.771 --> 16:44.533
program in the same manner that Mr. Bill Adams in El 
Paso took a temporary leave of absence from his

16:28.771 --> 16:44.533
assistant director job and became the director of 
CRP. And because there was nobody on staff at the

16:44.553 --> 16:58.052
time that would have the time to direct these CRP 
activities, research activities, the then city

16:44.553 --> 16:58.052
manager, Mr. Marvin Townsend, turned the 
responsibilities over to Mr. Ernest Briones, who

16:58.741 --> 17:05.352
had formerly been a health department employee. 
But Mr. Briones had, in my opinion, a lot of

17:07.094 --> 17:12.884
administrative skills, very good management 
skills. When Kern was brought in, basically back

17:13.925 --> 17:26.385
in 71, the first thing he did was put together a 
staff, qualified individuals, not of what I would

17:13.925 --> 17:26.385
characterize as a planning type, none of which 
came from Texas A&M University, several who came

17:26.618 --> 17:33.147
from the LBJ School of Public Affairs. Most of them 
had economic and sociological type of

17:34.630 --> 17:42.441
undergraduate work and graduate work behind 
them. And that program was, in my opinion, a

17:42.461 --> 17:55.039
beginning of a transition from an emphasis on 
physical planning, short-range type of planning

17:42.461 --> 17:55.039
that that moved into more of the social economic 
type of planning looking at some of the human needs

17:55.441 --> 18:22.579
of the community as opposed to the physical needs 
such as street improvements water sewer

17:55.441 --> 18:22.579
extensions new utilities etc and we had over the 
years i can recall you know we had gone through so

17:55.441 --> 18:22.579
many different kinds of programs the planners 
seem to be in my opinion the most versatile

17:55.441 --> 18:22.579
professional group in the world They seem to be 
able to do anything that happens to be brought

18:24.061 --> 18:29.489
before them. I've always told some of the people 
who work for us, we never say no to a project. We'll

18:37.841 --> 18:46.474
say yes first and then we'll go about doing it and 
we'll find we're resourceful enough to figure out

18:37.841 --> 18:46.474
how to do it.

18:46.960 --> 19:14.892
this is this we had moved from as you can remember 
some of the urban beautification programs the

18:46.960 --> 19:14.892
open space programs that you can recall the 
multitude of federal grants that were offered for

18:46.960 --> 19:14.892
community for community development and it was 
really ironic at two and funny at the time the

18:46.960 --> 19:14.892
planners became known by various titles 
depending on what program was in we had open space

18:46.960 --> 19:14.892
specialists we had urban renewal specialist, and 
we had urban beautification specialist, and CRP

19:15.057 --> 19:22.685
specialist, as it came to be known. But anyway, we 
had moved through collecting all the

19:23.866 --> 19:33.455
socioeconomic type data from the city and ready to 
start pulling together the pieces of

19:23.866 --> 19:33.455
comprehensive plan. One of the problems that we 
had, and fortunately for me, working under Mrs.

19:34.196 --> 19:43.005
Cunningham and coming up here as I did, He left me 
with some real good feelings about Mr. Anderson,

19:43.643 --> 19:48.569
who was at that time the director of planning. And 
although the Community Road Program was not under

19:49.811 --> 19:55.558
his direct control, it did...

19:58.301 --> 20:11.237
I did make the effort when I got here to personally 
get to know Mr. Anderson better and to start

19:58.301 --> 20:11.237
working with his staff because I knew that my job in 
developing a land use plan outside the auspices of

20:11.858 --> 20:16.022
the Department of Planning would be almost 
impossible. I needed that kind of close

20:16.042 --> 20:18.564
cooperation. And that's one of the first things I 
set out doing. And working with some of the staff

20:21.487 --> 20:39.283
members, Mr. Larry Winger, who's the chief 
planner now, basically the director of planning

20:21.487 --> 20:39.283
now, and Mr. Ogatz and several other people, 
because they had the, not only they had some of the

20:21.487 --> 20:39.283
resources, the mapping resources that we needed, 
but they had some of the, local expertise that we

20:39.719 --> 20:49.308
needed on what, in their opinion, was going to 
happen to some of the developable lands in our

20:39.719 --> 20:49.308
community. Unfortunately, the direction that 
the Community Renewal Program was taking as far as

20:49.328 --> 21:02.902
planning was concerned was not the direction that 
our former city manager, Mr. Townsend, wanted it

20:49.328 --> 21:02.902
to go.

21:06.165 --> 21:09.608
The Community Renewal Program studies and a lot of 
staff members began raising

21:09.959 --> 21:26.760
very controversial type of issues that only could 
be resolved through council, doing a lot of soul

21:09.959 --> 21:26.760
searching and developing some policies. And 
these kinds of policy questions is what I gather in

21:27.341 --> 21:33.969
the past had never been confronted with the 
council. Historically, planning and the city of

21:37.263 --> 21:50.221
Corpus Christi had taken a back burner since the 
formulation and adoption of the comprehensive

21:37.263 --> 21:50.221
plan prepared in 1958 by Harlan Bartholomew and 
Associates. That plan was sponsored, and I mean by

21:51.082 --> 22:01.636
sponsored, paid for by the Chamber of Commerce's 
Area Development Committee. However, I suppose

22:01.656 --> 22:04.620
at that time that there was enough good working 
relationships between the chamber and the cities

22:05.056 --> 22:15.248
and the county, that when the plan was brought 
before our governmental jurisdictions, that it

22:05.056 --> 22:15.248
was endorsed. That is the only plan that's been 
adopted, comprehensive plan, for the city of

22:16.390 --> 22:20.875
Ropes Christi. The community road program, 
realizing what we needed was a new plan, began

22:22.597 --> 22:31.468
working towards that direction. 1963, 1964, this 
area, under the leadership of William Anderson

22:32.258 --> 22:57.355
and several people at the State Department of 
Highways, and under the federal guidelines of the

22:32.258 --> 22:57.355
1962 Federal Highway Act, developed the first, as 
I've been told, comprehensive transportation

22:32.258 --> 22:57.355
planning study.

22:57.588 --> 22:59.991
which was published ultimately in 63 and 64. And 
this was an effort that culminated from the work of

23:00.471 --> 23:15.069
not only the city of Corpus Christi, but the State 
Highway Department and also Nueces County, which

23:00.471 --> 23:15.069
Nueces County and Corpus at that time constituted 
the urbanized area. And I think the Navigation

23:16.090 --> 23:17.872
District. The Navigation District also was 
involved.

23:23.278 --> 23:26.262
The plan, although it was published in 63 and 64, 
and what was the title, a transportation plan,

23:26.731 --> 23:36.642
really became our second approved comprehensive 
plan for the urbanized area. Because you cannot do

23:36.662 --> 23:47.513
transportation planning very effectively and 
ignore the other elements of a comprehensive

23:36.662 --> 23:47.513
plan. And so as far as the planning, of the 
preparation of the transportation plan went, it

23:51.520 --> 23:58.789
included every single element of a comprehensive 
plan. It was just labeled the transportation

23:58.869 --> 24:00.651
plan. It became the tool for carrying out planning 
in the Corpus area. To give you an idea how

24:05.396 --> 24:20.194
anti-planning, I think, the community became, in 
1967, 68, Harlem Athalamian Associates were

24:05.396 --> 24:20.194
brought back to Corpus, also under the Area 
Development Committee of the Chamber of Commerce

24:20.883 --> 24:26.709
to update their 1958 plan. This is it right in front 
of you. Which, you know, after ten years it needed

24:29.051 --> 24:33.195
to be updated. According to Anderson, the first 
plan had been built out and it had, in fact, come

24:33.655 --> 24:47.089
into reality so that the community needed another 
plan to go forward into the future. That's true.

24:49.030 --> 25:03.452
And I think if you go back through the 1958 plan, 
you'll find that the majority of significant

24:49.030 --> 25:03.452
recommendations for physical improvements and 
growth, the type of growth in our community, were

24:49.030 --> 25:03.452
followed. Although there were a few isolated 
projects that were extremely controversial. As

25:10.082 --> 25:12.405
soon as we have the harbor bridge, connecting our 
North Beach to our mainland. That was very

25:16.016 --> 25:17.378
controversial. The connection itself wasn't 
controversial. We knew we needed that. But there

25:20.602 --> 25:26.509
was a lot of controversy over whether it should be a 
bridge or should it be a tunnel. And it's my

25:26.890 --> 25:38.444
understanding and recollection from just 
talking with Anderson that the former mayor, or

25:26.890 --> 25:38.444
the mayor at that time, was really interested in 
having a tunnel. I mean, he wanted a tunnel. And he

25:39.886 --> 25:41.548
also owned a lot of property over there. I don't 
know if those two were related, but he felt that the

25:42.102 --> 25:46.448
tunnel was the best means. And when he was outvoted 
as far as going for a tunnel or a high bridge, he

25:47.029 --> 25:53.999
resigned his office to mayor. And that's how 
controversial that project was. That's pretty

25:57.324 --> 25:58.645
controversial. But nevertheless, you're 
correct. The plan had outlived its usefulness.

26:04.253 --> 26:11.063
Most of the projects that were recommended in it 
were accomplished or were well underway of being

26:04.253 --> 26:11.063
accomplished. And there was a definite need for an 
update or a new plan covering another 20-year

26:11.347 --> 26:20.976
plan, period. So with that kind of background, you 
know, the Area Development Committee embarked

26:20.996 --> 26:28.263
upon another update using the same associates. 
And paid for in the same way? Paid for in the same

26:30.345 --> 26:31.407
way. Well, I'm not sure where all the money came 
from. It may even be that the City of Corpus Christi

26:34.349 --> 26:38.133
put some money into it, but I don't think so. I think 
it was an Area Development Committee plan. And the

26:41.620 --> 26:46.766
Area Development Committee, I shouldn't say Area 
Development Committee Plan. They don't call it

26:46.786 --> 26:48.888
their plan. It's a plan for the community. They 
didn't want that kind of label on it. But I believe

26:56.596 --> 27:03.343
the plan was completed and it was done, as well as 
the first one was done. And it was very reasonable.

27:06.207 --> 27:07.668
It was implementable. There were some sections of 
the plan in my opinion, were really off the wall.

27:12.619 --> 27:20.507
And I think it created a lot of problems for the 
consultants in that they had gone, they had some

27:12.619 --> 27:20.507
fun with the project after they were through with 
the basic report. And they put together a separate

27:20.768 --> 27:38.586
report called Offshore Highway Proposals, where 
they intended to build a major transportation

27:20.768 --> 27:38.586
facility leading from the Cayo de Oso Bay to the, 
you know, traversing the Corpus Christi Bay and

27:20.768 --> 27:38.586
back into downtown. It was an alternate route into 
downtown. I've got to remember that this is prior

27:40.548 --> 28:08.310
to the strong environmentals and there was also 
very pie in the sky type of planning and it was never

27:40.548 --> 28:08.310
well received either and I don't know how much that 
particular proposal went in discrediting the

27:40.548 --> 28:08.310
whole report but I think there was some problems at 
the time when the plan was finally brought before

28:08.712 --> 28:35.530
presented to the city council and i think there was 
some some jealousies that it wasn't a plan that was

28:08.712 --> 28:35.530
commissioned by their own city council and 
developed under their direction that it was

28:08.712 --> 28:35.530
commissioned by someone outside them and they 
just did not want to adopt it and they didn't ever

28:08.712 --> 28:35.530
since that time any other document that has come 
before the council that was comprehensive in

28:37.315 --> 28:48.328
nature, that required some sort of endorsement, 
has been endorsed by concept alone. And this is

28:49.089 --> 28:52.993
basically what this means. It gives a councilman 
an out, not to follow any specific policy

28:53.053 --> 29:03.846
recommendations or to achieve any kind of 
quantifiable objectives. just endorsed in

29:04.298 --> 29:06.340
concept alone. And that includes the Bayfront 
development plans that have been developed over

29:06.461 --> 29:10.706
the past. That includes some of the area or 
neighborhood plans that we have developed.

29:19.456 --> 29:23.681
So basically, we just use these plans as 
conceptual guides. Now, I'll leave it up to you to

29:23.881 --> 29:28.787
determine how effective that is to a planner. You 
can't go back to a city council with this as a

29:28.987 --> 29:42.967
conceptual guide and say, this is what we need to 
do, this is what we talked about doing two years

29:28.987 --> 29:42.967
ago, because it doesn't have the importance. I say 
this because the transportation plan is not

29:42.987 --> 29:49.316
conceptually improved. It is adopted. It is 
project specific. It is also long range. And the

29:54.904 --> 29:58.048
reason it is adopted officially that is a 
requirement when the 1962 federal rate highway

29:58.501 --> 30:25.167
act was passed the department of transportation 
the secretary to the department of

29:58.501 --> 30:25.167
transportation was given sole authority to 
withhold any federal funding for highway

29:58.501 --> 30:25.167
improvements if he determined in his own opinion 
that the urbanized area didn't develop these

29:58.501 --> 30:25.167
projects quote within the framework of a planning 
process that was both comprehensive

30:26.986 --> 30:43.591
and developed cooperative among local area 
governments, and that it was coordinated with all

30:26.986 --> 30:43.591
other planning functions. And with that kind of 
sign-off required in order to continue receiving

30:43.611 --> 30:53.787
urban systems funds for highway improvements, 
that left little question for what kind of

30:43.611 --> 30:53.787
approval city council had to give to it. Since that 
time, we have been using the tool of approving a

30:55.150 --> 31:07.289
master transportation plan for this area as our 
way of addressing other comprehensive planning

30:55.150 --> 31:07.289
needs. What do you mean by that? I mean that we 
happen to include in our transportation plan a

31:11.256 --> 31:17.766
land use element.

31:20.497 --> 31:30.405
we have to include in our transportation plan 
sections dealing with various utilities.
