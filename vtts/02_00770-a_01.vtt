WEBVTT

00:01.330 --> 00:03.092
There's part of it that's good. I can go ahead with 
the rest of it. Another reason I decided to go to

00:05.434 --> 00:13.161
Texas A&M was because of the fact that it was a less 
expensive school than most of the others. And I

00:14.482 --> 00:17.365
especially liked the idea of military training. 
And I had been assured by some of my friends who were

00:19.727 --> 00:25.572
already at A&M that I could probably get a 
part-time job.

00:30.436 --> 00:31.017
Now, that's it. But after I came to Texas A&M, I had 
some difficulty because there were more students

00:31.283 --> 00:39.914
wanting jobs than they had jobs for. And I had some 
difficulty, but I did real well in my freshman year

00:39.974 --> 00:52.811
and not so well in my sophomore year because I did 
spend quite a bit of time at an odd time job. And I

00:54.393 --> 00:55.734
didn't have time to study. But I made all that work 
up the next summer. and finished my degree on time

01:02.131 --> 01:07.357
without any difficulty.

01:09.760 --> 01:17.810
And I retained my commission in the Reserve Corps 
until World War II started. And I mobilized with

01:18.591 --> 01:22.356
the 36th Division in November 1940.

01:24.879 --> 01:30.045
Because I went to summer camp during the 
summertime, you see, and did my regular

01:24.879 --> 01:30.045
schoolwork. uh in fall and spring and attended 
some summer schools. I for instance got my

01:36.510 --> 01:57.042
master's degree at Texas A&M in 1928 by going to 
school while I was teaching at Hearn and coming

01:36.510 --> 01:57.042
down here every Saturday for conferences with the 
head of my department and chairman of my committee

01:36.510 --> 01:57.042
and I did all my dissertation work in between 
times. So when I came back and At the beginning of

02:00.569 --> 02:07.521
the second summer, I had completed all the 
research and done some of the typing. So I finished

02:09.764 --> 02:19.120
the typing in June and had approved by the 
committee and completed the degree in August.

02:19.140 --> 02:21.865
And I took some special courses at North Texas 
State. It was called Teacher College then, I

02:24.489 --> 02:26.813
believe. I did this because I was teaching some 
special work in the Temple Junior College, which

02:27.080 --> 02:37.891
prepared students for teacher certificates in 
health and physical education field.

02:42.356 --> 02:45.319
And you want to just continue this military thing, 
or how much do you want? Well, I want to ask what

02:45.379 --> 02:56.530
people you remember while you were a student here, 
who you were closely associated with, or any

02:45.379 --> 02:56.530
particular professors that made an impression on 
you? There were three students that helped me more

02:57.505 --> 03:05.939
than any others while I was a freshman. One of them 
was O.P. Weiland, who was commander of my unit,

03:07.181 --> 03:12.230
which was the band. You were in the band. I took 
field artillery military training, but I lived

03:13.512 --> 03:19.382
with the band because I played an instrument in it. 
And O.P. Weiland was most helpful to all freshmen.

03:25.113 --> 03:31.919
And I had another man who was Nat Turner, who was a 
junior at the time. And he helped us with our

03:31.939 --> 03:35.082
academic work primarily. If we needed help, we 
went to him. And I had another one named Paul

03:38.586 --> 03:40.928
Washburn. Incidentally, Nat Turner and Paul 
Washburn both live in Houston now. And O.P.

03:46.653 --> 03:54.040
Weiland retired as a lieutenant general from the 
tactical air forces.

03:54.745 --> 04:05.118
Washburn was particularly good because he

03:54.745 --> 04:05.118
knew how to keep the freshmen pumped up when they 
got discouraged and down in the dumps. He spent

04:06.640 --> 04:11.887
quite a bit of time with freshmen who were 
discouraged and wanted to go home. And he tried

04:13.709 --> 04:22.420
also to keep the Stoutmore from hazing the 
freshmen.

04:22.881 --> 04:24.583
I remember especially Dr. I think they called him 
Dr. D.B. Cofer. I'm not sure he was a doctor. But he

04:28.837 --> 04:31.040
was in the English department. And he made his 
class work very interesting. And he'd help us in

04:35.005 --> 04:39.491
our study time. Any night we wanted to, we could 
meet him. And he'd help us, not just with English,

04:43.176 --> 04:46.020
but other courses too. And I had another professor 
in the drawing area named Dudley Baker. I think

04:53.808 --> 05:11.574
Dudley died a few years ago, but he was especially 
helpful in advising us about student employment

04:53.808 --> 05:11.574
and how to study and how to retain what we got in the 
classroom and how to take notes and things of this

04:53.808 --> 05:11.574
sort. And I never did forget what he taught me. And 
then I had a Professor A. Mitchell, who was head of

05:14.599 --> 05:22.971
the, I think they called it engineering drawing at 
the time. And he took some kind of a special

05:24.318 --> 05:34.347
interest in me, and I never did know why, except he 
had a son in school at the same time I was, a

05:24.318 --> 05:34.347
freshman. And we used to visit quite often, and I'd 
go down to the house with this boy, and Professor A.

05:34.367 --> 05:42.274
Mitchell got interested in me. And then I had one 
other professor named Sugareff,

05:43.816 --> 05:52.063
S-U-G-A-R-E-F-F, who was in my opinion, one of the 
best history teachers I ever had. And so inspired

05:58.289 --> 06:10.004
me with belief in America that I was one of those 
demons on patriotism after I got through with his

05:58.289 --> 06:10.004
courses in American history. And I've never 
gotten over that, which I think helped me a great

06:10.024 --> 06:17.713
deal in my work at A&M, really.

06:21.710 --> 06:25.796
Now, there were some other teachers, but I can't 
remember all their names at this time. For

06:25.816 --> 06:34.510
instance, I had a chemistry teacher that was the 
most complete teacher I believe I ever had. But he

06:35.772 --> 06:40.820
was patient with all students. And if students 
started lagging behind, he'd require them. He

06:44.646 --> 06:49.894
didn't ask them, but he forced them to come in and 
get extra help until he pulled himself up. And I

06:52.051 --> 06:55.335
think I learned more about teaching from this one 
professor. And I'm sorry I can't even think of his

06:55.355 --> 06:57.077
name. This is awful. But he had all the good 
qualities of a good teacher, in my opinion. And I

07:08.090 --> 07:09.852
had some good math teachers, too. This one math 
teacher that I can't think of his name was

07:10.193 --> 07:16.921
excellent.

07:17.822 --> 07:20.725
And that's the reason I ended up teaching 
mathematics. And all the time I taught in public

07:21.903 --> 07:26.408
school, I specialized in mathematics. Taught 
some science classes, but preferred the

07:27.629 --> 07:33.755
mathematics because I thought I was better 
qualified. You said you were in the band then. Can

07:35.257 --> 07:37.860
you compare the band then to, say, today? Yes. We 
had about 65 pieces in the band and lived in old

07:40.002 --> 07:47.309
Milner Hall. And the Cigna Corps lived in part of 
the building. We had a real good bandmaster.

08:01.065 --> 08:06.374
I thought pretty good, real good band, 65 piece 
band. We practiced four nights a week for an hour.

08:12.964 --> 08:16.810
And we participated in all ceremonies the cadet 
corps had on Saturdays. They had a ceremony every

08:17.171 --> 08:19.855
Saturday, except rainy day. And we participated 
in all kind of parades and things where the whole

08:22.079 --> 08:29.646
corps met out here in the afternoon. Did you go on 
corps trips? Went on corps trips. We made a trip

08:33.590 --> 08:34.991
every year. I was in the band to the Fort Worth Fat 
Stock Show. And while we were there, we played

08:37.934 --> 08:51.327
street concerts in the high schools and colleges 
in that area and played out at the Stock Show

08:37.934 --> 08:51.327
Pavilion every afternoon and every night. for a 
week. And we made some trips to places like Baylor

08:54.912 --> 08:59.619
College at Belton. I think they call it Mary Harden 
Baylor now. And we went to places like Navasota and

09:05.008 --> 09:11.177
played concerts. And then we played on the campus 
during the early school year, fall and up till cold

09:11.238 --> 09:17.888
weather. a Sunday afternoon concert out in front 
of Speedle Hall every Sunday afternoon. And

09:24.624 --> 09:30.391
incidentally, these programs were broadcast on 
an old radio station here on the campus. I kind of

09:30.771 --> 09:33.194
wish they'd go back to Sunday afternoon concerts. 
I've always enjoyed those. Anything that really

09:34.836 --> 09:38.860
stands out about your band experiences? Anything 
that's humorous or interesting or sticks with

09:38.880 --> 09:42.785
you?

09:45.668 --> 09:47.470
Not especially. It made it a little bit tough 
because this hour of practice we did at night, for

09:49.053 --> 09:55.382
instance, was extra. And then we had to spend about 
an hour and a half every Saturday morning in a

09:56.764 --> 10:06.157
formal guard mount or battalion parade or 
something. They had a different unit have a

10:06.177 --> 10:09.602
ceremony every Sunday, and we always had to play. 
And then we had to play these Sunday afternoon

10:11.425 --> 10:17.153
concerts, and all these things were extra 
time-consuming.

10:18.736 --> 10:25.807
I had some difficulty, but I had some of the best 
friends I ever had anywhere in the band, because we

10:18.736 --> 10:25.807
were close together. We participated with each 
other in everything. Even our intramurals were by

10:30.253 --> 10:33.418
band. We didn't do like a lot of other units did. And 
I remember that my little sister died when I was a

10:37.404 --> 10:46.077
freshman, and I didn't even have that money to go 
home. before I knew what was happening and they had

10:46.394 --> 10:49.797
enough money for me to buy a railroad ticket. And 
when I came back, I brought money from my father and

10:50.858 --> 10:56.884
they wouldn't take it because they wanted to help 
me this much. And I have never forgotten that, of

10:59.147 --> 11:01.369
course. And I had real good help from people like 
Paul Waxman and Nat Turner and O.P. Wallin. Now we

11:11.359 --> 11:12.520
had some

11:14.963 --> 11:22.050
Difficult is mainly because of the fact that some 
of the military people didn't want us to spend this

11:14.963 --> 11:22.050
extra time with the band. They wanted us to spend 
all of our time with the military unit. And in fact,

11:26.935 --> 11:36.824
one of the captains, who was my supervisor, told me 
he wanted me to drop out of the band so I could devote

11:26.935 --> 11:36.824
all my time to military tactics. And I didn't 
especially like this, and I didn't. I stayed with

11:41.849 --> 11:44.412
the band all four years. I'm glad. That's great. 
And I don't know of anything else, really. Did you

11:51.272 --> 11:52.012
work? You said you worked while you were a student. 
Yes. Could you tell me what? I worked for the ground

11:55.516 --> 12:04.585
maintenance department, digging ditches and 
flower beds and mowing grass, 25 cents an hour. I

12:04.625 --> 12:05.947
was going to ask you how much. Yes, 25 cents an hour. 
And then I was fortunate enough to get a job waiting

12:07.368 --> 12:16.257
tables in Speedy Hall when I was in the second 
sophomore semester. And I believe that we got the

12:17.435 --> 12:23.242
equivalent of our board, which was about $20, $25 a 
month. And then in addition to that, I worked some

12:25.865 --> 12:38.079
on Saturday for cotton seed and corn research out 
at the experiment station. I did some work out

12:39.901 --> 12:46.328
there for Dr. Mangelsdorf and the corn breeding 
and also for Dave Killough and the Cotton

12:47.118 --> 12:49.401
Breeding. Now who helped you? Did you go looking 
for work or was there a place on campus where this

12:50.702 --> 12:56.789
information was available then? There really 
wasn't much place to look. The secretary of the

12:58.431 --> 13:11.505
president handled whatever loans were made and 
they didn't actually make a loan they just had you

12:58.431 --> 13:11.505
sign a note and you paid it out twenty dollars, 
thirty dollars a month. And this man was Mr. S.G.

13:11.525 --> 13:14.188
Bailey And you could ask him for a job, but he really 
didn't help anybody. He was Secretary of the

13:18.125 --> 13:23.231
President, and he handled all these notes and 
things, but he didn't have time. So you had to go on

13:23.251 --> 13:24.693
your own. I got my jobs, I got all my jobs on my own by 
going directly to the people that hired me. I see.

13:32.923 --> 13:35.046
How did you know where to go then? Could you ask? I'd 
ask, like over there in Band Hall, I asked Captain

13:36.147 --> 13:44.918
Weiland, where can I go find a job? This Mr. Hensel 
is in charge of the ground maintenance. He hired

13:49.413 --> 13:55.162
all the lawn mowers and the ditch diggers and the 
flower bed keepers and things of this sort. And he

13:56.204 --> 13:58.688
showed me where his office was. So I went to see Mr. 
Hensel. He's the man that hired me to do this work.

14:03.375 --> 14:09.705
And at that time, incidentally, most of the 
faculty lived in houses on the outskirts of the

14:03.375 --> 14:09.705
campus. And the college kept up a lot of these 
yards. And I don't know how they decided which

14:12.068 --> 14:13.791
ones. I remember two or three of those professors' 
houses that I kept yards for. Do you remember the

14:19.475 --> 14:21.558
names of them? One of them was Ed Williams down here 
on Joe Routt Boulevard, right back where old Guy

14:21.878 --> 14:28.525
Hall was. I don't—Ruthers had her down. And then 
there was a head of the rural education

14:31.348 --> 14:40.217
department, Pop Hughes, W.L. Hughes, lived there 
on the corner. right across the street from

14:43.775 --> 14:47.680
Coliseum now, where the parking lot is. I mowed his 
yard once a week. And Mr. Hensel paid me, of course.

14:55.571 --> 14:57.414
I don't even know for sure where they did it. I went 
to Sergeant King, who was the man in charge of the

14:57.814 --> 15:04.904
student labor in Dining Hall. He was a sergeant in 
the Army, and they paid him actually for this duty

15:04.924 --> 15:12.094
with the permission from the Army. So I went to 
Sergeant King and told him I needed a job working. I

15:15.662 --> 15:23.191
knew this didn't take a lot of time when you studied 
and everything, because right at mealtime,

15:15.662 --> 15:23.191
that's when you had to eat. So he put me on the list, 
and he and Sergeant Tyler, they were the two men

15:24.433 --> 15:33.924
that helped get me a job on the dining hall staff. 
And I worked over there until I graduated. You

15:36.728 --> 15:37.729
worked three years there? Mm-hmm. I wonder how 
many people have gone through A&M waiting tables.

15:42.888 --> 15:43.849
I guess a whole lot. A whole bunch. Yeah, that's 
right. And after you graduated from A&M, you went

15:46.052 --> 15:51.658
on then to Hearn, then to teach math and coach. Now, 
we were talking about your beginning of your Army

15:53.621 --> 15:58.186
days, 1940. Was the 36th Division called active 
duty in 1940? 36th Division was called active duty

16:03.332 --> 16:07.737
on November 29, 1940. And that means since you held 
a reserve commission in that unit, you were

16:08.618 --> 16:12.523
activated. Yes. Now, actually, the 36th Division 
was a Texas National Guard division. And we had a

16:19.818 --> 16:24.103
National Guard company in my town, Temple. Old 
Company D, the 143rd Infantry.

16:28.508 --> 16:36.717
Soon after we mobilized, I was sent with about 25 or 
30 other officers from our division to a

16:28.508 --> 16:36.717
three-month school at Fort Benning, Georgia. And 
when we returned from Georgia, we went to Camp

16:38.099 --> 16:42.544
Bowie in Brownwood. where the 36th Division had 
moved to. I stayed with them as a company

16:44.915 --> 16:50.060
commander, and I was promoted while I was in 
school. At the time you were mobilized, what was

16:51.021 --> 16:53.884
your rank when you were mobilized? When we 
mobilized, I was a first lieutenant, and I was

16:54.084 --> 17:01.651
promoted to the rank of captain. You see, back at 
that time, you couldn't be promoted unless there

17:01.671 --> 17:05.074
was a vacancy. Now, I'd been a first lieutenant, I 
think, six or seven years, which was longer than

17:05.895 --> 17:12.902
normal, but they didn't have a vacancy. So my 
captain got promoted to a majority. And while I was

17:19.642 --> 17:21.583
in school, they made me a captain. When I came back, 
I commanded a company, and they transferred me to

17:21.603 --> 17:25.627
another company. But for some internal reasons in 
the regiment, they had some problems out there.

17:31.653 --> 17:35.897
But I stayed with them until January 1942. And in 
January 1942, I was assigned to a cadre to form a new

17:38.459 --> 17:42.703
division. and went back to Fort Benning, Georgia 
for one month and was assigned to 82nd Infantry

17:43.645 --> 17:56.104
Division,

17:43.645 --> 17:56.104
which was commanded by General Bradley. And my 
regimental commander was an A&M graduate, 1918

17:57.967 --> 18:02.073
class. Can you think of his name? Colonel Easley. 
Easley. Called him Spec

18:08.562 --> 18:12.268
Easley. Incidentally, he became a Brigadier 
General and was killed in Okinawa.

18:23.895 --> 18:30.827
Then we left Fort Bend, Georgia in February and 
moved to Camp Claiborne, Louisiana. And this was a

18:31.247 --> 18:32.469
brand new camp. So we got in about 18,000 draftees 
and started training them first week in March.

18:43.197 --> 18:46.020
In August of that year, we were transferred. We 
were made into a motorized division, and the 1st of

18:46.321 --> 19:08.007
September made into the 1st Airborne Division, at 
which time I was sent to Fort Leavenworth with five

18:46.321 --> 19:08.007
other officers, especially to study the command 
functions and to specialize in airborne tactics.

19:10.231 --> 19:21.308
When I got out of school in November, I rejoined the 
division which had moved from Claiborne,

19:10.231 --> 19:21.308
Louisiana to Fort Bragg, North Carolina, so we 
could get the airborne training and get ready to go

19:10.231 --> 19:21.308
overseas. Now, this division is what now? 82nd. 
It's still the 82nd. It came from the 82nd Infantry

19:24.533 --> 19:27.697
to 82nd Airborne. Right. Okay. And you perhaps 
remember the 82nd because it's where we started

19:29.861 --> 19:39.495
York's outfit, World War I. I called it AA, or 
All-American Division. And we trained at Fort

19:41.686 --> 19:53.179
Braille, North Carolina and went to North Africa 
in early May 1943. Landed at Casablanca on the 10th

19:54.100 --> 19:57.043
of May. Made an amphibious landing there. No, we 
made a, we went because the invasion had already

19:59.886 --> 20:08.476
started there and we were trying to get to North 
Africa in time to cut off the retreat of the

19:59.886 --> 20:08.476
Germans. And we unloaded our ships and went to 
Usta, which was about, I guess, 150 miles from

20:11.605 --> 20:18.756
Casablanca. And we trained there until about when 
we got to Usta, the Germans had escaped. They were

20:24.504 --> 20:25.446
all gone. They had gotten into Sicily and Italy. So 
they weren't in a particular point. So then they

20:31.094 --> 20:34.760
sent us down at Usta to prepare for the Sicilian 
invasion. And we were the assault division with

20:36.202 --> 20:41.089
one British division on Sicily. a short time after 
Fourth of July. We tried to make it on the Fourth of

20:45.757 --> 20:48.681
July, but we didn't quite make it. And my 
particular outfit didn't go to, essentially

20:49.802 --> 21:12.493
because the Navy and the 45th Division shut down 
about 25 of our planes on the incoming echelon, and

20:49.802 --> 21:12.493
we lost about 575 paratroopers, and so they called 
off our part because I belonged to a gladiator

20:49.802 --> 21:12.493
regiment. And it's good because if we'd have gone, 
we'd have probably had about 60% casualties. So we

21:20.466 --> 21:21.908
went amphibiously. And we didn't know much about 
what we were doing, but we went amphibiously. And

21:26.253 --> 21:29.237
then we went from Sicily. Where did you land in 
Sicily? We landed at Gela, G-E-L-A. And how long

21:36.606 --> 21:37.607
were you in Sicily? We were in Sicily about a month 
and a half or two months. And then we loaded up to go

21:42.410 --> 21:45.534
to Italy. But we got some bad information from the 
Italian Army, so we had to call off our parachute

21:47.757 --> 21:54.807
operation. We were to load two parachute 
regiments on the beach. We did send one parachute

22:00.214 --> 22:06.983
battalion up to Avelina, and they got chopped to 
all the pieces. But we finally sent We finally did

22:12.363 --> 22:16.647
send two regiments, but they just jumped on the 
beach. Not as a combat exercise, just a quick

22:16.667 --> 22:20.431
method of getting there. We sent the rest of the 
troops in by LCTs, landing craft. We landed on Red

22:26.677 --> 22:33.084
Beach, just a little bit out of Salerno. Then we 
transferred over to Maori and joined up with the

22:35.166 --> 22:42.133
Rangers, Darby's Rangers. Not General Rogers, 
but Colonel Darby. And we stayed with him until we

22:47.764 --> 22:50.248
reached Naples. And then we made, we, the 82nd was 
the occupying division for Naples until

22:52.051 --> 22:59.505
Thanksgiving. We got to Naples on the 4th of 
October of 1943.

23:08.422 --> 23:18.713
And we got orders, very quick orders, to go to 
Ireland to get ready for overlord operation in

23:08.422 --> 23:18.713
Normandy in 1944. Back up just a minute and see if 
there's a quick one here. Is there anything that

23:22.717 --> 23:25.100
sticks out in the Italian campaign? Any things of 
interest? Any contacts you may have had with Omar

23:26.982 --> 23:34.710
Bradley or anybody that was involved? Patton? 
Patton was in Sicily. He didn't go to Italy.

23:39.404 --> 23:43.488
Anything that may have happened that might be of 
interest or a little known fact? Yes, I remember,

23:43.508 --> 23:50.076
well, I bumped in first to quite a large number of 
ex-Aggies. Oh, I'm sure. With the various

23:52.899 --> 23:57.824
divisions occupying Sicily and Italy. And I had 
quite a number of contacts with John Clark, Mark

23:57.904 --> 24:04.752
Clark, Fifth Army. And I did have some contacts 
with John Patton. in the initial steps of this

24:09.627 --> 24:15.572
invasion, first part of it. And I knew quite a 
number of British officers, mainly because of the

24:17.334 --> 24:31.527
fact that on all these airborne operations we 
tried to coordinate so we wouldn't have any

24:17.334 --> 24:31.527
conflict of priorities. And I knew quite a number 
of them. Did you ever get a chance to meet

24:34.570 --> 24:37.052
Montgomery? No, I never did meet Montgomery. I saw 
General Bradley a good number of times. Your

24:44.527 --> 24:45.728
impressions of Bradley? In my opinion, Bradley 
was

24:46.629 --> 24:52.955
sort of a school teacher type of guy, really. Had a 
wonderful memory and was one of the most complete

24:53.956 --> 25:03.146
tacticians I ever saw.

25:05.028 --> 25:07.090
And then I found out later, up in the middle of the 
war that he was not only a tactician, but he was

25:07.289 --> 25:14.577
worldwide. He had all the political aspects of 
this thing in his command. Just listen to some of

25:21.044 --> 25:23.746
those guys like that. He was one of Eisenhower's 
chief advisors, I found out, because I know two or

25:23.987 --> 25:33.837
three times when up in the Ardennes, for instance, 
Montgomery didn't want to do what General Ridgway

25:35.555 --> 25:38.419
wanted to do. Ridgway was our corps commander, you 
see, because Ridgway was one of the old West Point

25:38.439 --> 25:52.079
boys that was hard as nails, but an expert on 
tactics. And he commanded 82nd, and then later,

25:53.120 --> 26:03.655
when he organized the 18th Airborne Corps, he 
became the corps commander as a part of the 1st

25:53.120 --> 26:03.655
Allied Airborne Army. and it was called Allied 
Airborne because it had British and American.

26:10.405 --> 26:19.055
Bradley was, he knew what he wanted to do, and he 
thought it all out ahead of time, and he was fast. He

26:19.135 --> 26:22.239
didn't have to fool around two or three days to make 
a decision. He made it. He was sympathetic, and he

26:24.181 --> 26:33.051
was patient, but if a guy was slumping off or 
cowardly, he had no sympathy with him.

26:35.984 --> 26:42.590
I thought he controlled Montgomery almost as well 
as I did, really. He just had to say, we're not going

26:43.431 --> 26:48.997
to do it that way, Monty, because it's not 
tactically sound. We're going to do it this way.

26:51.619 --> 26:52.100
And that's it. That's fine. No more discussion 
about it at all. And I saw him do that up there at

26:55.283 --> 27:00.388
Harzay in Belgium. Did you have any contact with 
Patton that you can remember anything about him?

27:05.380 --> 27:06.501
Not very much. I had to report to General Patton's 
headquarters one time as a representative of the

27:06.521 --> 27:30.222
division staff to find out what the details of the 
attack were going to be, because General Ridgeway

27:06.521 --> 27:30.222
had been told that he might be called on to 
supplement this attack, even though we knew we

27:06.521 --> 27:30.222
weren't going to make an airborne attack. We were 
going to be used as ground troops. So I had to go up

27:33.064 --> 27:35.286
there, and I spent the whole day talking to his 
staff first, and then when he gave his combat

27:36.346 --> 27:52.792
orders to his, I had to identify myself as it, 
because they'd all talked to just any and

27:36.346 --> 27:52.792
everybody, but he gave his combat orders for the 
next day's operation while I was there, and then I

27:36.346 --> 27:52.792
went back with this in my mind. I wasn't allowed to 
write any of this down or take any map marks or

27:52.812 --> 28:03.028
anything, but I had to memorize all this and take it 
back to General Ridgway, and we had a code word that

28:03.346 --> 28:08.211
If they wanted us to go, all they did is phone him 
this one word, and then we went. But we didn't go.

28:11.234 --> 28:14.738
Really, that's the only contact I had with him 
directly. Now, I did hear him make three speeches,

28:15.078 --> 28:19.563
one in Africa and two in England. I heard him make 
that speech he got so much fame for on the fourth day

28:21.064 --> 28:30.754
of June, which was printed in magazines all 
around. They used some of the excerpts in this

28:32.337 --> 28:35.942
Patton story on the movie. Just the one where he 
left the Russians out or whatever it was? They were

28:41.610 --> 28:44.014
still trying to cover up for him. Well, actually, I 
think they didn't allow any newspaper people at

28:44.174 --> 28:47.900
this meeting. That's what I was told anyhow. I know 
when he got through his speech, he told us, now

28:50.263 --> 28:58.855
there won't be any mention made by anybody in this 
outfit that you've seen Patton or heard him. And

29:00.378 --> 29:02.040
the Army was trying to keep him covered up. They 
wanted to make it look like he'd gone back to the

29:02.763 --> 29:05.405
United States. But he was a good commander. Good 
field commander. Oh, yeah. You see, and one reason

29:15.033 --> 29:26.263
I know that is because when we were down in Arden's 
campaign, we had 101st Airborne Division cut off

29:15.033 --> 29:26.263
completely at Bastogne. And General Ridgway was 
commanded 82nd. and the 101st.

29:36.678 --> 29:43.329
And he called on Patton to try to relieve the 
pressure on the 101st, and he did. He did

29:43.349 --> 29:44.250
eventually. Wheel 90 degrees or something. 
Right. I know my father was in the 26th YB and made

29:47.174 --> 29:51.661
that wheel. Now, you talked about going to Ireland 
for Overlord. Could you tell us a little bit about

29:56.088 --> 29:58.511
the preparations for Overlord? Yes. About three 
weeks before we left Italy to go to Ireland, I was

30:02.888 --> 30:12.540
made Division G-4 with supply logistics. And I had 
to get busy and relearn some things I'd forgotten.

30:21.452 --> 30:26.999
We had supplies in Italy, Sicily, and North 
Africa. And we had carried enough parachutes for

30:27.019 --> 30:32.085
three complete airborne operations. We had to get 
all this stuff loaded. And when we took off, we had

30:36.428 --> 30:45.700
to load out in the harbor because the harbor in 
Naples was full of something ships, or battered

30:36.428 --> 30:45.700
ships. We took off by loading out in the harbor and 
were heckled and harassed considerably by the

30:45.800 --> 30:59.136
German bombers until we got to O-Ran, I guess it 
was. And we joined up with a British outfit, and I

31:00.348 --> 31:10.480
think there were about 50 ships in the convoy that 
went through the Straits of Gibraltar at night so

31:00.348 --> 31:10.480
they wouldn't be able to see too much of what we were 
doing. And we headed out for the middle of the

31:10.900 --> 31:21.493
Atlantic and headed due north and ran into one 
storm and one or two submarine pikes. So we had to

31:21.953 --> 31:24.296
change course and skirt them. We had bummer escort 
all the time, B-17. So it actually took us longer to

31:30.115 --> 31:33.399
get there than we thought. We left, after we left, 
sailed out of Naples Harbor on the morning of the

31:34.500 --> 31:44.613
Monday before Thanksgiving. And we hooked up at 
O-Ran for one day. And we got to North Ireland,

31:50.280 --> 31:53.764
Belfast on the 10th of December. It was cold and 
blue-bladed. We'd gone all over the dang Atlantic

31:59.107 --> 32:00.229
But we didn't lose anybody. North Atlantic is 
something, isn't it? We didn't lose a ship. We ran

32:04.815 --> 32:09.763
into some submarine packs that were definitely 
identified, but we didn't lose any ships, which is

32:04.815 --> 32:09.763
good. We landed in North Island, really, because 
there wasn't any space for us to land in England at

32:10.564 --> 32:17.474
that time. We're about to North Island. We landed 
at Belfast, and we were scattered from... We had

32:18.976 --> 32:27.949
one regiment at Ballymena, one at Cookstown, our 
division headquarters, a

32:28.182 --> 32:37.330
small town about 20 miles out of Belfast. I can't 
even think of the name of it now. We had our

32:42.034 --> 32:56.147
parachute maintenance thing at a bomber base 
about 40 miles out of Belfast, because we had to get

32:42.034 --> 32:56.147
all those chutes off of those boats, ships. and 
hang them up and dry them, because they'd been down

32:56.988 --> 33:00.453
in the hole a good while. And we didn't know whether 
they were damaged or not, so we had to dry them all

33:01.595 --> 33:04.600
out. Of course, it was colder and blue blazes in the 
North Island. We did as much training as we could,

33:09.708 --> 33:16.879
but mainly we got the guys who were crippled, you 
know, rejuvenated. We got replacements for the

33:17.480 --> 33:20.525
guys that we lost down there. We got resupplied, 
and we found out a lot of things we'd done in Africa,

33:25.895 --> 33:38.673
some of the equipment was inappropriate, some of 
it was not very efficient, so we had to remake a lot

33:25.895 --> 33:38.673
of our equipment. We did most of that in Ireland. 
For instance, could you give me an example? Yes, we

33:44.020 --> 33:50.890
had a parachute company, a parachute maintenance 
company.

33:51.224 --> 33:53.446
that had some real good experts in it. They'd take 
these pieces of equipment, like a guy would go up

33:53.466 --> 34:00.632
with a radio pack on, and he'd jump with it on. And to 
see how it got his, see if it fouled his rifle up, see

34:01.913 --> 34:11.782
how hard it was to take off as he hit the ground, how 
many of them were broken and all this. So they found

34:11.802 --> 34:18.208
out that these pieces of equipment were either too 
loose or too tight. Nearly all of them, they made it

34:19.609 --> 34:20.910
right Patterson, but they just made them from blue 
pressure. They didn't have them tested

34:24.535 --> 34:26.677
completely. And we found on that operation down in 
Italy, for instance, a lot of the guys were getting

34:28.359 --> 34:38.529
their shroud lines fouled up with their rifles and 
bayonets. And we always equipped each guy with at

34:39.891 --> 34:45.477
least two hand grenades in their big pockets. And 
sometimes they got fouled up with the equipment.

34:49.848 --> 34:51.710
And it made it real dangerous. But we had two guys 
that were killed this way. Pulled that pen out

34:55.195 --> 34:56.696
prematurely.

34:59.440 --> 35:05.167
So all these tests were made by officers, 
incidentally, not by enlisted men. But the

35:05.187 --> 35:07.570
officers would take this equipment up and jump 
out. We had one major that jumped out as much as 10

35:07.590 --> 35:12.096
times a day up there for weeks. And when they'd come 
back, then we'd all meet. Since I was a G4, they

35:18.907 --> 35:27.055
wouldn't do anything without my approval, and we 
had to buy some pieces of canvas and what do you call

35:18.907 --> 35:27.055
it? Glove fasteners, for instance. A lot of these 
things we had were those little things where you'd

35:28.536 --> 35:34.101
turn them, and you couldn't get them loose if they 
got jammed. But these glove fasteners, you could

35:34.121 --> 35:39.786
pull it, and you couldn't keep them from coming in 
fast. We had some other adjustments made on our

35:40.127 --> 35:45.792
parachute releases because some of the jams were 
coming, you know, when a guy would get in on the

35:46.396 --> 35:52.525
ground or in a tree, he'd hit that button and it 
didn't release. Couldn't get out of the chute

35:53.687 --> 35:55.990
except by cutting himself out with a gun. 
Humpty-dumpty shroud lines to cut. So we didn't

35:59.496 --> 36:12.555
want that to happen, and we also wanted to perfect 
some of our pathfinder equipment so that we could

35:59.496 --> 36:12.555
have a school with the Air Force people. they're 
going to have to fly us and we want to get down where

36:13.548 --> 36:41.732
we're supposed to go and we we tested all that 
equipment and found a lot of it defective and

36:13.548 --> 36:41.732
deficient when you got on the ground it wouldn't 
light up the signals wouldn't operate well it's no

36:13.548 --> 36:41.732
good if it's not going to operate so we we we 
repacked a lot of our equipment and repatted a lot

36:13.548 --> 36:41.732
of it and made different facets and unfasteners, 
where you put zippers on a lot of it, where it could

36:41.915 --> 36:47.460
be controlled easily. We made over 100,000 pieces 
of equipment in North Ireland getting rid of this

36:48.761 --> 36:54.005
invasion. So then in February, we went to England 
because they had built some new controlments in

36:56.027 --> 37:07.277
the Midlands, Greenham,

36:56.027 --> 37:07.277
right out of Leicester. In fact, we had the 
division headquarters in the city park Victoria

37:11.480 --> 37:14.445
Park in Leicester. And then we had our field of 
operation for the invasion down at Greenham

37:14.465 --> 37:24.041
Commons, which was about 100 miles south. So we 
started our training program by taking a

37:26.384 --> 37:37.082
battalion at a time, battalion of paratroopers 
and battalion gliders out with the Air Force

37:26.384 --> 37:37.082
people, pathfinders and all. And we ran further 
tests on our pathfinder equipment by going out

37:39.627 --> 37:46.137
toward Norway and coming back in across the North 
Sea. Coming in blind to see if we could actually

37:47.559 --> 37:51.806
home in on these stations. Because we didn't do too 
good a job homing down on that Sicilian and Italian

37:51.826 --> 37:58.396
operation. And we wanted us, well we had to have 
this Normandy operation good or it was going to be a

37:58.416 --> 38:04.004
failure. So we did a lot of night practicing and We 
assimilated as much as we could. We got all of our

38:10.928 --> 38:13.570
plans and details ready. And when we got ready for 
the invasion, we moved south with the glider

38:13.710 --> 38:23.679
units, because they couldn't be tugged all the way 
from north. The paratroopers operated from their

38:24.520 --> 38:27.803
regular home bases. And we sent out two American 
divisions and one British division, beginning

38:29.925 --> 38:37.512
about 11 o'clock on D-1, and then our glider, our 
gliders started out about midnight. I was in the

38:48.315 --> 38:49.356
glider. We left Greenham Commons in the 
particular glider that I was in. My glider was the

38:56.926 --> 38:58.449
first one off. And on that first lift, we only took 
52 gliders and brought in 126 the next afternoon at

39:00.671 --> 39:07.060
5 o'clock. How many men to the gliders you were on? 
We had 13, plus the pilot and co-pilot. 13 combat

39:13.539 --> 39:16.983
people. Now we carried in some equipment too. We 
carried in a few tank destroyers and a few heavier

39:19.165 --> 39:28.937
guns that we could use for small artillery because 
we had to have something to fight those tanks off

39:19.165 --> 39:28.937
with. What were your thoughts going over it that if 
the landing didn't come off, I wonder if you all

39:30.059 --> 39:36.827
thought about you'd be stuck there? Oh, yes. If 
that crossed your mind. Yes, we thought about that

39:39.945 --> 39:41.547
quite a bit. Of course, some of us knew for months 
where we were going and when. How many? Not many?

39:49.840 --> 39:53.085
Not very many, no. So far as I know, the division 
staff were the only people that knew prior to a week

39:53.125 --> 40:01.718
before invasion time. Now this, when I say 
division staff, the general and assistant

40:03.183 --> 40:10.330
general and chief of staff and the one, two, three, 
four. We were the only ones. What was your

40:13.573 --> 40:15.475
objective? Our objective in Normandy operation, 
you're talking about division objective now.

40:20.140 --> 40:24.284
Well, where you were going, your glider was on the 
way, and what was the particular destination?

40:24.344 --> 40:24.604
Yes. Well, my regiment. And incidentally, don't 
forget, I was a division staff officer at the time

40:29.086 --> 40:34.254
we made the Normandy invasion. You were G4 still. I 
was a G4. So I was on the general staff, and I had to be

40:36.958 --> 40:46.933
with him as much as possible, or close enough to him 
that he could contact me when he needed to know

40:36.958 --> 40:46.933
something about the supply situation. The supply 
meant ammunition and medicine, whatever. And we

40:52.482 --> 40:57.169
had enough.

40:57.503 --> 41:04.209
supplies packed up in parachute bundles to make a 
resupply for three days. Now this was about a

41:06.131 --> 41:09.374
hundred and ten times a day really. It all packaged 
and loaded with proper colored chutes and

41:09.994 --> 41:13.817
everything. And we had, and the quartermaster of 
course was trained with us because they had to do

41:15.379 --> 41:22.605
the kicking of the bundles out of the planes. But 
our objective was to get back inside france and cut

41:27.608 --> 41:54.679
off the retreat of the forces the german forces up 
near the coast and to keep new units from coming

41:27.608 --> 41:54.679
into the coast because the germans we knew had most 
of their stuff further south and further to the

41:27.608 --> 41:54.679
east because they thought we were coming into 
breast apparently which is what we wanted yeah

41:27.608 --> 41:54.679
yeah So we

41:57.224 --> 42:02.590
were supposed to do this. And then in addition, we 
had certain functions about the Dove River and the

42:02.650 --> 42:09.337
River. And there's a railroad that ran by there, 
too. It had some heavy artillery, some of the big

42:12.941 --> 42:16.545
long range artillery things. And we didn't want 
them to come down from the coast and hit us too hard.

42:23.772 --> 42:26.235
So we severed the railroad line, really. What time 
did you land? Well, our paratroopers started

42:30.469 --> 42:37.379
landing at 12 o'clock and the gliders landed at 4. 
It took us about 30 minutes to make full landing.

42:41.084 --> 42:44.028
But the gliders didn't come in on top of the 
paratroopers? Y'all had a separate objective?

42:45.971 --> 42:48.294
Yeah.

42:49.336 --> 42:54.103
The major portion of the gliders came in at 5 
o'clock that afternoon. They caught holy heck.

42:57.569 --> 42:59.672
Yeah, because of daylight. We anticipated a loss 
of 25% of our initial force. This is what we

43:06.681 --> 43:08.884
estimated before we started. We didn't lose quite 
that many. We lost a whole lot of men, but we didn't

43:11.929 --> 43:16.034
lose 25% the first day. Actually, we lost about 
10%. How many gliders came down safely? Did most

43:22.422 --> 43:24.345
land safely on the first lift? Yes. On that first 
lift out of 52 gliders, we only lost six. And they

43:28.651 --> 43:31.115
were lost to hazards, trees? They were shot down, 
shot down mostly. Just met everybody in them. Now

43:35.402 --> 43:39.288
we lost two on the ground. They hit something. They 
hit trees or buildings or something. Now some of

43:45.077 --> 43:46.460
the men got out of them. Yeah. Now, these fields 
were, don't forget, were surrounded by Germans.

43:50.572 --> 43:52.634
We just landed out in the middle of these Germans. 
Did that bring on immediate fire? Oh, yeah. I found

43:56.538 --> 43:58.441
one glider up there that never got in. It was killed 
as he came out of the door. Stacked up as they were.

44:04.788 --> 44:06.750
You could see what happened to him. The glider 
wasn't injured, but as these guys came out, they

44:06.770 --> 44:11.376
were hit. Well, we lost two guys on the glider out 
there. They weren't killed, but they were

44:14.960 --> 44:16.902
severely wounded. We left him in the ditch, went 
back later and picked him up with a medical crew.

44:24.151 --> 44:31.219
But we captured St. Mary Glees, which was the hub of 
all the transportation there. There was an

44:31.239 --> 44:32.781
airdrop right on that town. Yes. All these gliders 
that went in with us landed, I'd say, I don't think

44:35.344 --> 44:42.572
any of them landed further than five miles from St. 
Mary Glees. And one parachute battalion landed

44:43.373 --> 44:46.737
within a mile of St. Mary Glees. And some of them 
landed right on top of the town, fell right into the

44:47.510 --> 44:51.214
city. But we did. We got all our objectives. We 
blocked two bridges to keep the German tanks from

44:56.299 --> 45:02.825
coming. We cut the railroad to keep those heavy 
guns from coming down. We blocked three highways

45:08.471 --> 45:15.458
to keep armored and motorized outfits coming in. 
And we hooked up with the 4th Division, the 82nd, I

45:16.805 --> 45:27.870
don't know what the 101st did, but we hooked up with 
the 4th Division about daylight on D plus 1. And

45:30.095 --> 45:33.362
incidentally, I was wounded at 7 o'clock on D plus 
1.
