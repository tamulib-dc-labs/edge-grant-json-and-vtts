WEBVTT

00:02.680 --> 00:07.886
As I remember, parties or things like the Methodist Church is a great program now.

00:08.727 --> 00:11.770
And I've been with them several times on trips.

00:11.870 --> 00:18.478
But no, I don't remember having a formal program.

00:19.078 --> 00:22.082
And I wouldn't say that people were unfriendly.

00:22.582 --> 00:25.726
They were nominally friendly, I would say.

00:26.106 --> 00:30.031
Did a number of your friends go over there?

00:30.051 --> 00:30.291
Oh, yeah.

00:30.331 --> 00:32.113
Do you remember Religious Emphasis Week?

00:32.836 --> 00:33.357
No, I don't.

00:34.638 --> 00:37.502
Because when I got here in 59, that was still going strong.

00:38.823 --> 00:40.185
All right, athletic events.

00:42.047 --> 00:45.812
Well, the first two years we went to the games in the band.

00:46.313 --> 00:46.573
The football.

00:46.593 --> 00:47.394
Football games.

00:48.275 --> 00:52.000
And then the next two years, of course, we're still in the Corps.

00:53.562 --> 00:53.882
Oh.

00:55.600 --> 00:58.265
I remember one funny thing that I thought was funny.

00:58.826 --> 01:12.409
A&M in Texas were walking off and somebody, a guy from Texas, I don't know, 56, I think, came up and ran up to caught up with Darrell Hooper and just whacked him, hit him in the ear, just terrible, knocked him over.

01:12.429 --> 01:13.972
And Darrell was a great big old guy.

01:14.332 --> 01:16.596
He just turned around and floored the guy behind him.

01:17.909 --> 01:20.412
Pardon me, but that I remember.

01:22.634 --> 01:33.146
But the games, oh I remember Trinity, we were playing Trinity and they tore the uniform off their mascot.

01:34.067 --> 01:34.708
That was funny.

01:35.449 --> 01:45.300
Now what was the, did you and your buddies during a football game, what did y'all, what was a game day for y'all?

01:46.647 --> 01:50.472
It wasâ€”you know, Haskell, a lot of this stuff.

01:50.492 --> 01:51.013
I'm sorry.

01:51.033 --> 01:52.695
It just passes me.

01:53.977 --> 01:56.019
But I remember it was very full.

01:56.760 --> 02:06.233
We had to do a lot of different things, and then we had to march over there, and we had to get in uniform, and then we had to come back, change uniforms, and so it was a full day.

02:06.734 --> 02:08.937
Do you remember anybody drinking at football games?

02:09.678 --> 02:09.938
No.

02:11.977 --> 02:14.910
I don't think so.

02:14.990 --> 02:17.059
In basketball, did you all go to basketball games?

02:19.148 --> 02:20.614
Not as well.

02:20.654 --> 02:22.020
I went to basketball games.

02:22.810 --> 02:26.855
Most of us went to watch the halftime, which was the gymnast.

02:27.496 --> 02:29.739
And boy, they'd come in, and we really enjoyed that.

02:29.819 --> 02:36.247
But the basketball, I've never really... First off, the people that play are just different.

02:36.267 --> 02:37.328
I mean, they're just taller.

02:37.808 --> 02:38.549
And so it's different.

02:38.569 --> 02:45.878
I've always been about 5'8", and 5'9", and, you know, it's kind of not my type of game.

02:48.261 --> 02:51.265
All right, as you look back on those student years,

02:54.248 --> 02:59.675
Did it matter where a student came from in terms of family background?

02:59.795 --> 03:02.439
Not at all, or I wouldn't have been here.

03:03.200 --> 03:05.603
In fact, H.P.

03:05.623 --> 03:07.685
Zachary and Hal Hagey lived down the hall.

03:08.406 --> 03:10.629
George Louquette lived there.

03:10.669 --> 03:14.034
And I and my roommate was from Mexico.

03:15.275 --> 03:17.118
And we had a guy, a Chinese guy.

03:18.059 --> 03:22.905
No, in those days you assumed an ag was an ag, really.

03:23.273 --> 03:24.494
Did everybody have a nickname?

03:25.635 --> 03:26.076
Poncho.

03:26.696 --> 03:28.638
No, not everybody.

03:28.738 --> 03:31.961
Because I know before World War II, everybody had a nickname.

03:31.981 --> 03:32.161
No, no.

03:32.621 --> 03:34.503
But you mentioned one of them was Poncho.

03:34.743 --> 03:35.564
That was my roommate.

03:35.804 --> 03:36.885
Everybody called him that.

03:36.905 --> 03:37.286
Okay.

03:37.306 --> 03:38.887
What about the Chinese?

03:39.508 --> 03:40.148
Don't remember.

03:40.288 --> 03:40.869
Don't remember.

03:41.830 --> 03:50.918
All I remember, he was there and Hal Hagey, whose dad was a big farmer, and Jack.

03:52.349 --> 03:57.758
something whose dad was an aerial photographer in San Antonio, I remember.

03:57.778 --> 03:58.299
Did H.B.

03:58.319 --> 03:59.080
Zachary Jr.

03:59.141 --> 04:01.485
have a nickname?

04:01.685 --> 04:02.026
No.

04:02.046 --> 04:04.730
Did Clady, other than Clady?

04:04.870 --> 04:10.039
Not, see he kind of disappeared, I think he went to Ag or something, disappeared after that first year.

04:10.640 --> 04:10.821
Oh, okay.

04:10.841 --> 04:14.627
So I really didn't follow him too much.

04:15.012 --> 04:20.240
What were the student organizations that had a high prestige and profile?

04:20.280 --> 04:21.001
The band?

04:21.522 --> 04:22.343
The band did.

04:22.363 --> 04:22.843
That's right.

04:22.884 --> 04:23.404
The RVs.

04:24.967 --> 04:25.367
Okay.

04:25.447 --> 04:27.190
And then the firing squad.

04:27.691 --> 04:29.012
I mean, those are the ones I was on.

04:29.032 --> 04:32.818
See, I was on the RVs and the firing squad.

04:34.132 --> 04:41.286
The student court was pretty high and then the student activities at MSC.

04:41.927 --> 04:49.181
But they took a lot of time and, man, I was, you know, it's funny how I studied all the time just about.

04:49.582 --> 04:53.710
Well, I didn't have any money to do anything else, go to movies or whatever.

04:53.690 --> 05:04.523
So, and I didn't have much time to do the things that they do a lot now and that's working with MSC or student activities and student government, things like that.

05:04.563 --> 05:14.095
How often did you and your close friends in your junior, senior year we'll say, how often did you all go off campus on a weekend?

05:15.316 --> 05:16.197
Often as we could.

05:16.898 --> 05:17.899
Often as we could.

05:17.979 --> 05:20.322
Where were the places to go for fun?

05:21.297 --> 05:23.240
Well, of course, we were all trying to date there.

05:23.260 --> 05:30.853
We'd go to Texas, University of Texas and University of Houston.

05:31.734 --> 05:33.657
We went to some activities at the University of Houston.

05:33.697 --> 05:34.859
We used to have Frontier Day.

05:34.879 --> 05:35.541
We went there.

05:35.581 --> 05:44.175
Did you ever go to Denton?

05:44.275 --> 05:44.335
No.

05:45.563 --> 05:47.706
But we did write to the mailbox.

05:47.726 --> 05:50.629
We found out their list of mailboxes and we wrote to the mailboxes.

05:50.770 --> 05:51.350
I remember that.

05:51.911 --> 05:54.014
And one guy got a date that way.

05:54.674 --> 05:59.200
Didn't they sometimes bring down a whole busload or trainload of tessies?

05:59.220 --> 06:10.054
You know, I don't remember because I remember that the communication, see I didn't have enough money to date them anyway so I don't remember exactly who that was.

06:10.414 --> 06:12.617
But wrote to the mailbox.

06:13.981 --> 06:21.052
Where were the places that you went for a good time here off campus?

06:23.636 --> 06:27.162
Triangle Drive-In, I guess, which is where the Texan is now.

06:27.523 --> 06:27.623
Okay.

06:27.643 --> 06:28.825
That was about it, man.

06:29.786 --> 06:30.648
You'd go to Bryan.

06:30.668 --> 06:38.099
Bryan was very, you know, we were about six miles from Bryan and you just felt really unwanted downtown Bryan.

06:38.139 --> 06:40.984
So people would go and we'd go two or three at a time.

06:41.588 --> 06:47.959
Because if you wore a uniform downtown, you'd, I don't know, I guess the local guys would harass you or something.

06:47.979 --> 06:51.085
Did you hitchhike to go to Bryan?

06:51.105 --> 06:51.486
Mm-hmm.

06:54.070 --> 06:55.192
Okay.

06:55.212 --> 06:56.514
I think there was a trolley one.

06:57.156 --> 07:01.403
If you wanted a cool beverage, where did you go and get a cool beverage?

07:02.530 --> 07:04.473
You know, I never had one.

07:04.493 --> 07:05.013
I don't know.

07:05.174 --> 07:14.567
I mean, but I do know that we had the Clay Pits and the Brazos River and we'd go there for our beer parties.

07:14.607 --> 07:15.188
I remember that.

07:15.448 --> 07:17.050
Describe one of those parties.

07:17.070 --> 07:21.817
Well, they would, you know, they'd have the beer ice down.

07:21.897 --> 07:22.878
Everybody would show up.

07:23.860 --> 07:30.529
You'd go across the Brazos Bridge and there used to be a liquor store and you'd turn right and you can go right down to the bank of the,

07:30.897 --> 07:47.646
sandbar there and they'd have a sandbar and they'd have a fire going and the logs, they'd kind of drag them up around in a circle and that'd be an outfit beer party and I was kind of the, in those days, kind of the designated driver.

07:47.807 --> 07:51.994
Everybody gets skunk drunk and I'd roll them into the back of the car and we'd come in.

07:52.025 --> 07:54.969
All right, now one of those beer parties, would that be all male?

07:55.089 --> 07:56.370
Would there be some girls there?

07:57.191 --> 07:59.034
Most of them, I don't remember girls or anything.

07:59.975 --> 08:00.916
I remember all males.

08:01.136 --> 08:01.877
At the Clay Pits?

08:02.238 --> 08:06.703
At the Clay Pits, there's some other stories, but I can't verify those.

08:06.723 --> 08:07.344
There's some stories.

08:07.564 --> 08:09.967
They had real interesting parties out there.

08:11.028 --> 08:11.449
Oh, okay.

08:11.749 --> 08:16.395
Now, was Hard Liquor still going when you were Mr. Ed's?

08:17.219 --> 08:18.160
No, I miss that.

08:18.300 --> 08:22.826
I just ask, I'm a little bit of a weenie because I had zero money.

08:22.867 --> 08:25.049
You got to remember it's different than today.

08:25.450 --> 08:29.035
All right, now you're here during the Korean War time.

08:29.836 --> 08:31.298
Yes, yes.

08:31.438 --> 08:36.004
Did any of your buddies get called away?

08:36.305 --> 09:05.940
Well, two of my high school buddies, when I came to A&M, one of them joined the Navy Reserve, another guy was drafted, I think, and they both spent some bad times in, one of them about froze to death, another one, real bad times, they called them, and, but I was at A&M, so I had my deferment, but I was getting ready for pilot training, and so I knew that when I graduated in 54, if the Korean War would have kept going,

09:06.376 --> 09:09.101
then I was getting ready to be involved.

09:09.401 --> 09:16.514
Did you and your buddies ever, do you remember lying awake at night or talking about what that might mean to you?

09:20.040 --> 09:26.832
No, but I did talk to, these were pretty good buddies, Carl Ferguson out of Pasadena and someone else.

09:27.098 --> 09:34.435
I did talk to them and they were pretty well frightened and concerned and it turned out that they, you know, should have been.

09:35.256 --> 09:43.074
No, we didn't sit around too much thinking about it because I was pretty eager, you know.

09:43.154 --> 09:46.542
I mean, pilots are strange people and I was ready.

09:47.264 --> 09:52.371
And I forgot when it was over, but it must have been over in 53 or something.

09:53.293 --> 09:58.840
Because after that, that did, that was a relief, yeah, yeah.

10:00.122 --> 10:01.104
But I was motivated.

10:02.285 --> 10:05.209
Other, other student indulgences.

10:05.229 --> 10:10.176
How about, was there a high percentage of your contemporaries who smoked?

10:12.199 --> 10:13.321
No, no there wasn't.

10:13.822 --> 10:14.302
Very few.

10:14.803 --> 10:16.225
Drank, it was about,

10:18.162 --> 10:20.745
Maybe about half would have a drink every now and then.

10:20.785 --> 10:21.506
And drink meant?

10:21.986 --> 10:22.347
A beer.

10:22.967 --> 10:23.067
Beer?

10:23.087 --> 10:23.588
Yeah, beer.

10:23.848 --> 10:24.629
What about whiskey?

10:24.649 --> 10:27.312
Well, you know, I don't remember ever seeing whiskey in there.

10:27.492 --> 10:31.176
Of course, like I say, beer is what I remember.

10:31.197 --> 10:37.103
Did you and your friends even know the word cocaine or heroin?

10:39.746 --> 10:46.173
I knew the word marijuana because a guy said that another guy said that the other guy used marijuana.

10:47.234 --> 10:47.815
And then I

10:48.233 --> 10:50.055
I heard that there was codeine.

10:51.777 --> 10:56.021
A girl that I was dating told me about someone who boiled codeine down to make a drug.

10:56.982 --> 11:04.570
But I remember one thing we had in high school was doing exercises and blowing on your thumb and knocking yourself out.

11:04.610 --> 11:05.591
I do remember that.

11:08.254 --> 11:12.638
What about chewing tobacco snuff?

11:13.208 --> 11:15.653
I'm sure they did, but I don't remember that either.

11:16.074 --> 11:21.226
I remember a cigar, they all get sick at a bonfire, they get a cigar, they're backed in silly.

11:21.867 --> 11:26.677
And if I remember, most of them got sick, so they weren't too, too, too competent in that era.

11:28.141 --> 11:31.929
But no, you know, we, it's kind of like it was different.

11:31.969 --> 11:32.871
We never heard of

11:34.117 --> 11:38.724
I don't even remember hearing of cocaine, and I still don't know what marijuana looks like.

11:39.585 --> 11:42.750
But cocaine, you got heroin.

11:42.990 --> 11:48.738
Heroin was kind of a term that we heard about, but anyway.

11:48.758 --> 11:49.600
I look up like that.

11:49.620 --> 11:49.720
Yeah.

11:49.740 --> 11:51.422
To be sure that little red light still goes.

11:51.442 --> 11:52.223
Okay, okay.

11:52.784 --> 11:53.145
Let's see.

11:53.385 --> 12:01.156
Who were the campus heroes, the celebrities in the student body during your time?

12:01.677 --> 12:02.959
You mentioned Dara Hooper.

12:03.175 --> 12:03.736
Yeah.

12:03.756 --> 12:05.578
He won the Olympics and the shot put.

12:05.638 --> 12:08.441
Who else were?

12:08.461 --> 12:11.324
But when they came down the hallway, people noticed him.

12:14.828 --> 12:17.291
Flaps was a corps commander as a senior year.

12:17.371 --> 12:18.672
He was interesting.

12:18.933 --> 12:20.034
What was his name?

12:20.054 --> 12:20.675
Boy, I don't know.

12:20.815 --> 12:21.215
I'm sorry.

12:21.395 --> 12:21.716
But his name?

12:21.736 --> 12:24.299
He had big ears, and his name was Flaps.

12:24.319 --> 12:26.101
And you know, I thought about that over the years.

12:26.181 --> 12:32.608
People need to be a little less sensitive to nicknames because Flaps was a great guy, and that's what they called him.

12:33.213 --> 12:45.079
you know it's just part of it's kind of like maybe you mentioned that earlier the nicknames well the nicknames were kind of related to your deficiencies kind of like four eyes or

12:45.430 --> 12:45.951
Shorty.

12:46.091 --> 12:46.953
Shorty.

12:46.973 --> 12:47.153
Stumpy.

12:47.374 --> 12:48.816
Yeah, things like that.

12:48.836 --> 12:52.223
There were a few that, but it wasn't mandatory and I mean not everybody had that.

12:52.443 --> 13:00.318
And you use those kind of as despite that he's a friend.

13:00.658 --> 13:01.019
That's right.

13:01.039 --> 13:04.024
Despite just having big ears or being short.

13:05.247 --> 13:06.208
No, I agree with you.

13:06.229 --> 13:07.050
Yeah, that's that was

13:07.317 --> 13:11.182
And I think that's our problem now in life and in the United States, just the whole world.

13:11.242 --> 13:15.468
People are so sensitive, lawsuits and everything, man, just flow with it.

13:16.068 --> 13:16.669
Anyway.

13:16.689 --> 13:20.755
What do you remember about bonfire during your undergraduate days?

13:20.775 --> 13:22.216
I remember some things about that.

13:22.817 --> 13:23.017
All right.

13:23.037 --> 13:23.718
Please share those.

13:24.840 --> 13:29.987
In the old days, we had the bonfire was in front of the MSC.

13:31.268 --> 13:32.650
And so we had guard.

13:33.035 --> 13:35.297
fires at every main entrance to the thing.

13:35.918 --> 13:40.363
So we would be assigned guard duty, which was kind of a cute thing, you know.

13:41.244 --> 13:43.806
And I remember that as, oh, it'd be cold.

13:44.387 --> 13:45.969
But assigning bonfire.

13:46.009 --> 13:51.094
What I remember most about in early on is as a freshman, we went out to the cutting area.

13:52.115 --> 13:53.657
And we cut out a big tree.

13:55.078 --> 13:56.700
And so we carried everybody.

13:57.060 --> 14:00.123
They put little limbs under it and got two guys on each side.

14:00.143 --> 14:02.586
We carried that tree out and set it by the logging truck.

14:04.034 --> 14:13.348
And the logging truck had a winch truck and it tried to pick up this log and the winch went down to the log and the truck end, front end came up in there.

14:14.349 --> 14:21.680
And so they said, okay guys, so what happened is it took about 500 freshmen.

14:21.700 --> 14:23.943
We just lifted that and put it on there and did no sweat.

14:24.444 --> 14:29.772
And this, the first time I've seen 3,000 people working to this common goal

14:29.903 --> 14:39.897
And I never would have believed that you could lift that log, but we got about 500 freshmen with a senior standing on the log, and we just kind of carried it out and put it on the truck.

14:41.179 --> 14:46.266
That I really remember about Bonfire, because what an interesting time.

14:46.306 --> 14:49.891
Here's a high school kid, never seen more than two people together.

14:50.492 --> 14:55.219
Here you got a couple thousand out there cutting and hauling and lifting and that sort of thing.

14:55.638 --> 15:00.104
Was the bonfire composed primarily then of logs?

15:00.124 --> 15:00.344
Yeah.

15:01.226 --> 15:03.429
And they were bigger logs, it appears to me.

15:04.230 --> 15:06.653
And we put up a center pole and put ropes on it.

15:07.034 --> 15:11.319
We had put up a center pole and had two ropes that were off at an angle.

15:11.680 --> 15:13.482
You get about 40 guys on each rope.

15:14.063 --> 15:15.806
And then the third rope went through a pulley.

15:16.326 --> 15:20.372
And so you'd pull the logs up and lean them against the thing.

15:20.412 --> 15:24.177
So we had, it was all manual.

15:25.895 --> 15:29.440
And the logs seemed to be bigger and they weren't trimmed, as I remember.

15:29.480 --> 15:31.282
They were just put up there.

15:31.302 --> 15:38.652
During your day, were there any attempts by somebody to ignite the fire early?

15:40.435 --> 15:44.460
Well, I'm sure you've heard it must have been about 54

15:46.128 --> 16:04.047
About the year 54, I'd left and Eddie Dansby sent me a bat that said two guys had refueled out at the air base and came in to kind of scare everybody and the wings came off and fuselage hit over by where the football dorm is now.

16:04.808 --> 16:12.576
Killed them, but I thought that was... So this is the year after you... I believe so, because I think Eddie sent me a bat, you know, Eddie Dansby.

16:13.937 --> 16:15.679
No, I'll tell you what we did.

16:18.022 --> 16:27.842
One time we had a, in our outfit I was, I took my saber and George Luke had a vet in our outfit.

16:28.763 --> 16:32.751
Our duty was to guard the road coming in from Colwell.

16:33.934 --> 16:38.663
And so we heard, we got the word that there were three carloads coming in.

16:39.352 --> 16:42.216
three carloads of guys coming in from Caldwell.

16:42.236 --> 16:44.159
So we laid in the ditch.

16:44.439 --> 16:46.462
It was kind of rainy and cold.

16:47.083 --> 16:49.306
We laid in the ditch and boy we saw the cars coming.

16:49.386 --> 16:56.917
So we had about 50 guys and we laid a log across the road and they used to have to come across a railroad track and they stopped at that log.

16:58.038 --> 17:08.633
And I remember running up with my saber putting, somehow they got the windows down and having my saber there and challenging who it was and I would look at it and ran up with the jawbone of a donkey about that big.

17:08.967 --> 17:10.048
challenged the driver.

17:10.088 --> 17:11.751
I thought that was funny.

17:11.771 --> 17:17.318
There were some freshman football players coming back from some trip somewhere, but that was funny.

17:17.518 --> 17:28.472
I remember also they used to, if you went through the checkpoint through the guard where the little guard fires were, then somebody threw a log through somebody's window.

17:28.492 --> 17:33.578
Some prof didn't stop and they threw a log through the window trying to get them stuck.

17:33.598 --> 17:37.303
Now was there a privy put up on top of the bonfire?

17:40.574 --> 17:46.460
Yeah, but it was actually, I have one here that the kids built the Privy over here.

17:46.781 --> 17:47.782
Oh, so it was.

17:47.842 --> 17:48.763
Well, no, start over.

17:49.304 --> 17:50.825
Yes, it was real in those days.

17:50.865 --> 17:55.771
They'd go out and steal somewhere on Weldon Road, and we'd get guys come in, just raise the sand.

17:55.791 --> 17:58.554
They went out to the restroom and wasn't there.

17:59.695 --> 18:04.140
So, yeah, they actually did that for three years, or maybe more.

18:05.601 --> 18:08.945
So they'd get the outhouse, and they'd put it up on top, and put T.U.

18:09.045 --> 18:09.906
frat house in it.

18:10.493 --> 18:17.854
The bonfire Silver Taps, Silver Taps held in those days.

18:18.256 --> 18:21.459
Yeah, well let me come in on the bond for one more.

18:21.519 --> 18:27.005
No, the outhouse, the freshman built one in our backyard here about 82.

18:27.606 --> 18:32.671
Yeah, the Silver Taps was there when I was a junior and senior.

18:32.691 --> 18:35.535
I was on the, you know, Tyrant Squad.

18:38.057 --> 18:38.618
And of course.

18:39.218 --> 18:42.542
What impression did that make in your heart and mind?

18:44.513 --> 18:53.230
Well, I think it's part of really develops A&M character to think about just guys that are coming to A&M.

18:53.250 --> 18:55.815
You don't know their background too much, but you know their Aggies.

18:56.817 --> 19:00.944
And of course, when Jeanette came, she wrote a good poem on that.

19:00.964 --> 19:07.517
She wrote a poem that they've used off and on for about 16 years.

19:07.497 --> 19:10.982
I think it, yeah, in those days you did turn the lights out afterwards.

19:11.022 --> 19:17.431
So afterwards you walked in silence until you got pretty far across campus.

19:18.513 --> 19:26.565
But it's one of the traditions that is really, is really.

19:27.426 --> 19:29.609
What about muster?

19:29.629 --> 19:37.200
Well, muster, since they used Jeanette's poem, since I've been here quite a bit, muster, but muster was,

19:37.670 --> 19:41.055
Another thing that we knew some of the eggs had died by then.

19:41.075 --> 19:44.661
A couple got killed in Correa, that sort of thing.

19:44.741 --> 19:47.365
So we all had to go to Muster's, I remember.

19:50.070 --> 19:51.973
Where was it held?

19:51.993 --> 19:52.393
Muster.

19:55.298 --> 20:00.927
It might have been held in, sorry.

20:01.177 --> 20:02.702
I really don't remember.

20:03.204 --> 20:04.428
It seemed like it was outside.

20:04.448 --> 20:08.101
It seemed like it was in the Grove, kind of.

20:08.121 --> 20:09.165
I think it was for a while.

20:09.185 --> 20:09.887
For a while.

20:10.458 --> 20:12.901
And then to the MSC steps.

20:13.301 --> 20:14.262
And then I remember that.

20:14.282 --> 20:16.405
In fact, Eisenhower was here on something.

20:17.166 --> 20:18.227
Was he here on muster?

20:18.447 --> 20:18.667
No.

20:19.488 --> 20:21.671
I don't know, but I know Eisenhower came during that era.

20:21.691 --> 20:23.192
Yeah, okay.

20:23.673 --> 20:27.838
I know I was in the RV and firing squad at the time, so I must have been a junior.

20:27.858 --> 20:28.719
Must have been about 53.

20:28.799 --> 20:31.021
Do you remember anything else about his visit?

20:31.742 --> 20:32.203
No.

20:32.223 --> 20:33.124
All y'all did or anything?

20:33.244 --> 20:33.444
No.

20:34.285 --> 20:36.988
All right.

20:36.968 --> 20:41.613
As you get ready, you're going on toward being a senior.

20:42.574 --> 20:44.076
Did you graduate in four years?

20:45.678 --> 20:47.080
No, I busted two courses.

20:49.923 --> 20:50.604
Oh, that's what it was.

20:50.704 --> 20:53.107
As a countess I busted, plus an ME 213.

20:53.647 --> 21:00.495
So I had to stay on in the summer and we ended up with, gosh, an ungodly number of hours, 152 hours or something like that.

21:01.201 --> 21:04.987
where now they want 138 and they're trying to get that down to 120, I think.

21:05.067 --> 21:07.991
And there was not a summer commencement then, was there?

21:08.532 --> 21:09.133
No, there wasn't.

21:09.474 --> 21:14.942
In fact, I graduated from A&M three times and never went to graduation.

21:14.962 --> 21:20.751
Because in the summer I graduated in Oakland, and when I got my masters in the summer, they didn't have anything.

21:21.352 --> 21:24.897
And I got my PhD at the end of the summer.

21:26.277 --> 21:28.080
Some, oh they didn't have one then either.

21:28.460 --> 21:32.446
So I could delay my PhD until the end of the year and I said no way.

21:32.807 --> 21:37.694
So I graduated three times and didn't walk across the stage once because of the summer program.

21:37.714 --> 21:38.455
You're right.

21:38.475 --> 21:46.207
Who were the campus, who were the campus presidents during the student days?

21:46.227 --> 21:48.310
What was your impression of them?

21:48.330 --> 21:49.652
President of the university?

21:50.797 --> 21:51.638
No impression.

21:53.000 --> 21:54.762
I didn't have any idea that you had.

21:54.782 --> 21:56.384
See, most of the students, they don't know this.

21:56.745 --> 21:57.205
People don't.

21:57.286 --> 22:02.693
Most of the students don't have any idea who the chancellor or president or dean of men is.

22:02.713 --> 22:15.049
And when they walk across the stage, what we've been doing, what I did for many years, I'd be down at the bottom of the stairs and welcome them or congratulate them from the department.

22:15.721 --> 22:18.224
And so they said, they all said, man, it's good seeing somebody.

22:18.264 --> 22:20.487
No, I'd never seen the dean, seen him once.

22:21.028 --> 22:24.352
And so that's an interesting thing that, and that's the way I was.

22:24.412 --> 22:25.454
I don't remember anything.

22:26.856 --> 22:27.897
Who was the president?

22:28.378 --> 22:33.124
Who was your, who was the department head in your student base?

22:33.144 --> 22:35.327
Arch Burgess, Arch Burgess.

22:35.347 --> 22:37.950
Did you have any interaction with him as a student?

22:40.353 --> 22:40.834
You bet.

22:42.130 --> 22:44.734
No, you bet.

22:44.754 --> 22:56.671
In fact, I've never heard of this being done before, and it never happened to me, and I'd never do it again, but he was such a knothead, I thought at the time, that I was in class for three weeks, and he was just caustic and everything.

22:56.691 --> 23:05.404
I said, man, I don't have to put up with this, and I walked out, and when I got to the door, he said, you'll get an F, and I said, I'll take it, you know?

23:06.160 --> 23:08.643
So I had to take another type course like that.

23:09.263 --> 23:14.769
Now, interesting thing, after he retired here, we took a trip to San Antonio.

23:16.050 --> 23:17.612
And it was a consulting trip.

23:17.732 --> 23:22.196
So when we came back, he said, well, let me just kind of rough this out so we remember what we did.

23:22.236 --> 23:24.759
And he went, typed it all up.

23:25.159 --> 23:27.141
And I said, now, you can make any changes you want to.

23:27.502 --> 23:28.803
It's about seven pages.

23:28.903 --> 23:31.386
And it was absolutely brilliant.

23:31.406 --> 23:35.830
So what it is, he was an extreme genius, and he didn't

23:36.333 --> 23:38.776
He'd write the beginning of the problem and say, now here's the answer.

23:38.896 --> 23:41.358
The rest is obvious, and you've heard that story.

23:41.639 --> 23:42.299
That's what he did.

23:42.980 --> 23:46.143
So when I came back as a PhD, I told Wertham I didn't want any.

23:47.164 --> 23:52.009
I'll come back, but I don't want any part of Burgess.

23:52.029 --> 23:56.454
Burgess was just a genius, and that was our difference.

23:56.894 --> 23:58.957
What about dean of engineering?

23:58.977 --> 24:02.340
Well, the dean was Benson, and I remember him clear as a bell.

24:02.725 --> 24:05.668
As an undergraduate, he was your dean?

24:05.788 --> 24:06.109
Pardon me?

24:06.249 --> 24:07.670
Don't know.

24:07.690 --> 24:07.971
Don't know.

24:07.991 --> 24:10.193
That's a, no, hold it.

24:10.453 --> 24:11.635
I don't know who the dean was.

24:13.016 --> 24:15.919
I don't know who the dean was when I was a freshman and sophomore.

24:17.000 --> 24:19.123
Right, so you didn't then?

24:19.283 --> 24:21.385
I think Benson was assistant dean, sure do.

24:22.026 --> 24:23.247
What about final review?

24:23.607 --> 24:23.988
Did you?

24:25.209 --> 24:25.549
Yeah.

24:25.569 --> 24:26.510
Your senior year?

24:26.851 --> 24:27.311
Yeah, we had.

24:28.252 --> 24:29.514
What was the, what did that say?

24:29.694 --> 24:30.775
Did that touch your heart?

24:31.767 --> 24:33.710
going through Final View the last time?

24:33.730 --> 24:36.354
Well, not really.

24:36.534 --> 24:40.480
The outfit was just a outfit.

24:40.660 --> 24:46.528
I mean, there wasn't great, you know, the people you knew and so forth, there wasn't a great feeling.

24:47.470 --> 24:50.714
There's feeling for people, but not a great feeling for the outfit.

24:51.015 --> 24:54.960
But it was great when you got your senior boots and changed uniforms.

24:54.980 --> 24:59.547
As I remember in the old days, they used to march through as they are and then they'd go change uniforms and

25:00.016 --> 25:04.906
20 minutes or 30 minutes later they come back and march through the new with the seniors lined up.

25:05.267 --> 25:06.990
I guess they still do that often.

25:07.211 --> 25:08.674
Where did you get your senior boots?

25:09.796 --> 25:12.522
I got them used and there they are right there.

25:13.003 --> 25:17.292
Remember what you paid for them?

25:17.312 --> 25:17.472
$80.

25:17.492 --> 25:18.514
$32 for my ring.

25:19.608 --> 25:22.051
And I saved up for that, but yeah, I remember that.

25:22.071 --> 25:24.595
I don't remember what the saver was.

25:24.775 --> 25:29.141
Where in those days, where did you physically obtain the ring?

25:29.281 --> 25:30.703
Was it the registrar's office?

25:33.226 --> 25:34.288
Former student office?

25:37.612 --> 25:40.136
I'm sorry, I have no idea.

25:40.716 --> 25:47.185
But I remember we could, we obtained it early, but you couldn't wear it until final review or something.

25:47.587 --> 25:54.915
So I wore mine and I taped my hand up for about a week like I'd been injured and I got to wear my senior ring ahead of time, see.

25:56.977 --> 26:01.962
Many people have had interesting incidents about their ring.

26:02.162 --> 26:05.265
Have you lost your ring ever and found it?

26:06.126 --> 26:10.491
It's my first ring that I really used is over in the ring collection.

26:10.571 --> 26:15.636
Back in the old days when Stern and Josh was collecting rings no one had

26:15.616 --> 26:23.667
54 and Jeanette got mine over there and then at that time she bought me another ring.

26:24.368 --> 26:27.212
That's at Texas A&M University.

26:27.392 --> 26:29.515
So the one you're wearing now is a second ring?

26:29.535 --> 26:44.695
Yeah that's bought in 70 when I got my PhD and then she had the wedding ring welded to it so I couldn't take my wedding ring off because I never take the Aggie ring off see so she said so I can't take my wedding ring off at parties or anything.

26:45.265 --> 26:54.302
Have you, in the years that you've won an A&M ring, do you have any interesting, I think you should figure shut that off.

26:54.322 --> 26:55.965
Yeah, shut that off.

26:55.985 --> 26:56.947
Yeah, kids are okay.

26:58.610 --> 27:08.067
Oh, now the interesting thing about the ring, I told you that though, when they first let girls in at 63, I was in Tyler and I dipped my ring in black paint.

27:08.317 --> 27:11.780
each week for about two months and I wore black.

27:12.301 --> 27:19.548
But like I say, now after I've been here teaching 30 years, I kind of shine my ring now because girls have made a great addition.

27:19.948 --> 27:22.751
All right, let's zero in on that.

27:22.771 --> 27:24.352
You were?

27:24.653 --> 27:26.374
An engineer with General Electric?

27:26.695 --> 27:28.396
No, we'll do that later.

27:28.496 --> 27:28.757
Okay.

27:29.137 --> 27:34.442
The attitude about why were you concerned about women becoming students at A&M?

27:35.536 --> 27:38.441
You know, to me, it's kind of like women in the service.

27:39.082 --> 27:40.484
I just don't like that.

27:40.585 --> 27:42.888
It's a terrible place of service is.

27:43.009 --> 27:54.468
People get killed, blown apart, and I've seen two or three guys killed, and I just wouldn't want, I just don't feel ladies are to lower themselves to that level to want to get killed in service.

27:55.049 --> 27:59.336
Now, at A&M, I think the big thing is it was a brotherhood.

27:59.477 --> 28:00.919
It was different.

28:01.287 --> 28:11.743
you didn't have girls you had to dress for, you didn't have dates, you didn't have the stress of girls trying to show off in front of them and whatever.

28:14.106 --> 28:21.878
So I thought it was cheap and it was just a great place to come and cheap and it kind of had a little camaraderie that

28:22.398 --> 28:23.960
is different than if girls are here.

28:24.982 --> 28:43.988
And so, but I can see why the girls are here, I mean in long range planning, but there seems to be a need for, or let's say at the time, we all paid five dollars for our uniform, we rented a uniform, Hennigan and Zachary and Al Hagee and whatever.

28:46.471 --> 28:51.578
So, I would say the main thing is when you saw an Aggie ring in the old days,

28:52.064 --> 28:54.767
You knew that that was a guy that had been through four years.

28:55.268 --> 28:56.169
He was pretty honest.

28:56.709 --> 28:59.292
He would probably be truthful, so forth.

29:00.033 --> 29:10.224
I'm not saying it's any different now, but now when you see an Aggie Ring, you don't know if he's been on campus or in the goer or lived off campus or been to any football games.

29:10.244 --> 29:16.992
So I think now it's a little bit more broad.

29:18.001 --> 29:25.612
Did you, was part of your concern about women, were you concerned about whether or not they academically could do the work?

29:25.632 --> 29:25.853
No.

29:26.794 --> 29:29.137
No, not at all.

29:30.319 --> 29:31.801
I really didn't think about it too much.

29:31.882 --> 29:34.606
I mean, we didn't, we didn't have a decision sort of thing.

29:35.687 --> 29:41.275
But we found out the girls do well academically, even, I mean, in engineering.

29:41.916 --> 29:44.380
Our best, some of our best students were the female.

29:45.170 --> 29:46.013
Let's see.

29:46.575 --> 29:51.491
Some feelings that you had as you're finishing your undergraduate degree.

29:52.495 --> 29:57.070
As you got ready to leave the campus and go off into the business world,

29:57.590 --> 30:03.238
How well prepared did you feel A&M had made you for that business or that real world?

30:03.999 --> 30:05.962
For some reason I felt real good about it.

30:05.982 --> 30:18.400
I just felt I was going with General Electric and as far as leaving the campus of course I was extremely happy to do that and at the time I said I'd never ever be back.

30:19.001 --> 30:20.583
I had such a terrible time.

30:21.885 --> 30:23.968
But I did pretty well and

30:24.202 --> 30:26.707
How did you and General Electric come together?

30:26.727 --> 30:27.629
How did you get that job?

30:28.270 --> 30:30.514
You know it's kind of interesting.

30:31.116 --> 30:43.200
They had come down to interview and I went over and talked to them and said I don't want to work for anybody else but GE I'm not going to interview with anybody else and this is really who I want to work with and I was real serious.

30:43.520 --> 30:46.446
I didn't interview with anybody else and in those days

30:47.523 --> 30:52.088
At 5 o'clock, at the end of the day, they put the roster up of those they had accepted.

30:52.669 --> 30:59.416
And then at 7.30, you had a dinner where they started handing out all kind of instructions and so forth.

30:59.436 --> 31:02.299
So I went over there at 5 and it was posted in the MSC.

31:02.820 --> 31:04.001
And there was my name on the list.

31:04.081 --> 31:05.362
I'd made the GE cut.

31:06.303 --> 31:09.787
And I felt very, very good.

31:13.351 --> 31:14.372
Yeah, I don't know.

31:14.392 --> 31:15.133
I felt confident.

31:15.805 --> 31:20.611
What did you feel A&M had done for you that gave you that confidence?

31:20.631 --> 31:23.975
Well, starting off with painting the boots with mustard.

31:23.995 --> 31:31.225
Number two, lifting that log and bonfire in the cutting area.

31:32.526 --> 31:36.351
And number three, seeing the results of some designs that we did.

31:36.371 --> 31:37.352
It's kind of like architects.

31:37.793 --> 31:42.739
We had a design project and seeing the results, yeah, that looks good.

31:43.140 --> 31:45.643
Did you think that the A&M

31:45.843 --> 31:50.630
engineering program was appropriately practical?

31:52.873 --> 31:56.377
I still do until about the last 10 years.

31:56.958 --> 31:57.459
You bet.

31:57.539 --> 31:59.041
And I helped maintain that.

31:59.061 --> 32:06.431
In fact, I taught a course called time study and everybody said that's out of business and got a call from one of my boys this week.

32:06.491 --> 32:08.594
They want 40 engineers in time study.

32:09.455 --> 32:14.382
Time study is trying to set a time to do a task and the Air Force is interested.
