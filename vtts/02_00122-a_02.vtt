WEBVTT

00:03.018 --> 00:13.393
And

00:03.018 --> 00:13.393
he helped me a lot in my work later on all these 
conferences that we had. He

00:14.615 --> 00:21.906
would work the hours that it took to get the job 
done. He worked many, many hours. He was very

00:25.011 --> 00:26.713
devoted. When you came, describe

00:26.913 --> 00:34.682
the administration of the campus at that point. 
Who were they and what were their

00:34.742 --> 00:37.505
responsibilities? Well,

00:38.887 --> 00:50.240
we had a dean of the College of Agriculture, of 
Engineering. We had an arts and sciences dean. We

00:56.056 --> 01:09.749
had medicine, vet medicine, and I, let's see, and 
the business administration was still a section.

01:10.650 --> 01:17.116
Who was there, who was the president then, when you 
arrived? When I arrived, I,

01:17.256 --> 01:25.084
there were two or three Well, let's turn it around. 
The basic division was, and let's work it out,

01:28.861 --> 01:32.847
basic division was headed by whom? Oh, it was 
headed by John Arbitran. John Arbitran was an A&M

01:36.812 --> 01:44.763
graduate, did his Ph.D. at Syracuse. No, not 
Syracuse.

01:49.630 --> 01:55.138
What is the...

01:49.630 --> 01:55.138
Oh, it set my mind. But he had done his PhD at this 
school.

02:05.879 --> 02:12.693
Cliff Randstolt was the assistant dean of the 
basic division. And I remember in numbers, The

02:17.866 --> 02:21.552
student body was very close to what it was in 39. And 
all freshmen were in the basic division? Yes.

02:26.620 --> 02:27.702
Regardless of their major?

02:30.627 --> 02:31.768
Yes. Bertrand reported to whom? He reported 
directly to the president. To the president. and

02:39.263 --> 02:43.848
you all were responsible for what? Tell me about 
what the Basic Division did. Well, the Basic

02:45.750 --> 03:06.452
Division was an organization of faculty members 
that would be responsible for the academic

02:45.750 --> 03:06.452
progress of the student through the sophomore 
year, if necessary. The students would all be

03:12.624 --> 03:20.053
under the same academic dean, which was Dean 
Bertrand. We had a staff of about six or seven

03:21.514 --> 03:31.566
counselors, and these counselors filled many 
roles. They did all of the testing and placement

03:37.280 --> 03:42.047
They worked with the day-to-day problems of the 
students. We taught what was called basic

03:42.127 --> 03:48.077
courses, which were guidance courses. Study 
skills, vocational guidance,

03:48.137 --> 03:55.668
things of this type. And this was available to the 
veteran, too. I remember, and we had We had some

04:06.423 --> 04:18.603
courses which were taught for the purpose of 
trying to get the student like chemistry 100. This

04:19.485 --> 04:22.409
would be a semester. English 100. Math 100. Now 
this did not last too many years, but it was a

04:26.516 --> 04:32.987
reality factor. And I saw students who had 
forgotten their math and they would take math 100

04:33.288 --> 04:48.004
and the first thing you know they were doing as well 
as the others. It was not a goofball type thing.

04:52.468 --> 04:54.330
Where were y'all physically located? We were in 
the old Aggieland Inn. Cross from Sabeasa. Cross

04:58.759 --> 05:00.501
from Sabeasa. And we had, we used two floors of that 
thing. We,

05:05.526 --> 05:24.085
there was a young couple who were there to, they

05:05.526 --> 05:24.085
were there simply to keep an eye on the rest of the 
Aggieland Inn because the MSC had had kind of taken

05:24.537 --> 05:27.921
over that part of it. Now, it had once been a hotel, 
small hotel, motel, life facility. When the MSC

05:34.390 --> 05:38.495
opened, did it continue to have overnight gas? It 
did overflow.

05:43.922 --> 05:48.368
But we...

05:48.719 --> 05:57.088
I think it was my second year that it was turned 
completely over to us. Well, we thought we'd

05:57.108 --> 06:10.923
blocked off the floors, but we later found the old 
boy had been camping out up there. Now, the

06:10.983 --> 06:17.950
staff that we had would

06:18.436 --> 06:31.074
serve as strong supporters of youngsters who were 
having difficulty of any type. We were given a lot

06:31.294 --> 06:35.880
of latitude in which to work. If we felt that the 
student was in a course that it was completely

06:37.002 --> 06:44.933
impossible, we could no-grade drop it. Or we could

06:46.432 --> 06:58.590
work with the department to work out some solution 
to it. There was a lot of flexibility in the way that

06:58.610 --> 07:03.176
it was carried out. Were there, in those years, 
some assistant and associate deans in each of the

07:03.216 --> 07:12.350
colleges with whom y'all had close working 
relationships? They had similar

07:12.650 --> 07:16.135
responsibilities? I don't think so. I think that 
there were associate deans like Mickey McGuire

07:18.364 --> 07:30.862
and, of course, Cliff over there later when the 
thing worked a different way.

07:33.927 --> 07:38.754
But you all were the primary academic counselors, 
advisors on the campus. Yes. Share with this

07:39.715 --> 07:43.000
machine and the future some anecdotes, some 
stories that give examples of some of the variety

07:43.520 --> 07:53.269
of experiences that you had. Well, you know, it was 
sort of practical. I remember the first year that I

08:00.676 --> 08:11.046
was, I had gone to the A&M adjunct in July and talked 
out there for six weeks, and then I came back to the

08:11.532 --> 08:22.987
campus.

08:26.392 --> 08:34.463
I had this student come in one morning, and he was 
very distraught, he was very upset. And he said, I

08:34.483 --> 08:37.827
have slept through my quiz A in chemistry. And he 
said, the whole thing is going to blow because I've

08:41.807 --> 08:51.182
got to make it. And I said, well, why did you choose 
to? He said, well, I work. And when I came in, I was so

08:58.493 --> 09:05.944
tired that I forgot to set the alarm. So I did it. 
Well, I wrote a note to the professor of chemistry

09:07.962 --> 09:27.125
and said, I think this is a very fine young man, and I 
think he's sincere, and I would appreciate it if we

09:07.962 --> 09:27.125
could work something out. Well, the prof felt the 
same way, but he's glad to get a fancy to They say,

09:35.097 --> 09:37.800
well, I did because Curtis told me. Well, the 
interesting thing is that that young man later

09:38.300 --> 09:49.251
became a state chemist at Texas A&M University. 
How nice. And he has retired now out from Blanco and

09:50.332 --> 09:57.318
a very fine man. But it was...

10:03.262 --> 10:05.665
But it was disappointing in a way though. My 
personal opinion is that we were getting the

10:07.688 --> 10:25.995
students that were in school during the war years 
in the public school and they

10:07.688 --> 10:25.995
probably lack of discipline. I mean, knowing and 
staying with something. And we simply were

10:33.759 --> 10:41.848
getting a number of those.

10:42.068 --> 10:47.995
We also taught a course in vocational guidance. 
And the purpose was to try to get the student into

10:48.015 --> 10:55.003
the right field. Not necessarily the course, but 
into the right field. And I sometimes wonder if

11:00.087 --> 11:05.353
we're any better off now than we were then. That's a 
tantalizing problem that I worked with for 30

11:05.614 --> 11:12.481
years. And I think we've made progress. But it's a 
shame, Pastor, for a young person to dump and spend

11:24.025 --> 11:28.069
the money that it takes. And then you discover that 
they really have no characteristics or strength

11:28.089 --> 11:38.760
to be doing that. What about some memories of some 
students that gave you a song and dance story that

11:38.780 --> 11:52.294
made up something which you had reason to believe 
might have been fabricated? One of the most

11:52.780 --> 12:09.703
interesting things that happened was that at

11:52.780 --> 12:09.703
the end of the semester, we always went through 
this ritual of the students would be dropped. That

12:09.723 --> 12:19.716
was one of the things that kind of broke our back, I 
think, was that we didn't give much

12:09.723 --> 12:19.716
understanding.

12:20.472 --> 12:27.562
we would, Dr. Ransdell and I would take the 
appeals.

12:32.028 --> 12:42.042
Well this student came in to me and I always 
prefaced a few comments by saying that We're here

12:43.152 --> 12:44.855
to help you. It's not punishment, but it's what is 
best for you and for the college. So now tell me in

12:53.409 --> 13:09.075
your own language

12:53.409 --> 13:09.075
why you feel that we should continue you. He said, 
alright. He said, I can do that. He said, you know, I

13:15.034 --> 13:19.158
have been down in the chapel all morning. And he 
said, I prayed. And God has called me to stay here

13:24.844 --> 13:34.193
and minister to the Aggies.

13:34.213 --> 13:37.096
And I thought, uh-oh.

13:39.899 --> 13:40.159
I I did a sneaky thing, I guess. I said, well, I 
believe this is beyond me. I'm going to ask you to

13:51.161 --> 13:57.048
wait outside and see Dr. Ransom.

14:01.414 --> 14:09.083
And I would never let someone stay without 
clearing the cliff because he was carrying a

14:01.414 --> 14:09.083
burden. Well, you know, there was a saying that if 
you can stay in Dr. Ransel's office 30 minutes, you

14:10.025 --> 14:22.441
can stay in school. Oh, really? Oh, no, I hadn't 
heard that. Yeah, well, that's what the kids...

14:24.263 --> 14:34.316
Well, the Corps had some very implicit comments to 
make about professors. Very meaningful

14:34.397 --> 14:37.821
something that... and they share it with their 
students. Well, I

14:42.142 --> 14:54.878
don't know how it worked out later, but I will say a 
follow up on this. I had a minister in graduate

14:54.898 --> 14:59.824
class. And he and I were visiting during the break. 
We had class from 5 to 8. I said, you know, I want to

15:08.800 --> 15:16.151
tell you something, and I want to ask you what would 
you have done? So I told him this story. And he said,

15:19.776 --> 15:24.062
Mr. Curtis, I can help you. He said, I had something 
happen one time that's a good example. He said,

15:28.489 --> 15:36.360
it's a cold Sunday winter evening, and I had gone to 
the chapel. to open it up for any of the GIs that

15:36.897 --> 15:43.045
wanted to come. And he said, I opened it up, and I 
went off to do something, came back, and there was

15:43.065 --> 15:53.379
this soldier sitting down on the front row. So I 
went over and said, soldier, can I help you? He

15:57.865 --> 16:03.833
said, I don't know whether you can or not, but he 
said, I've been called to preach here tonight. And

16:05.652 --> 16:09.977
I said, boy, you're getting close. And he said, 
well, I talked to him a little bit, and he said, the

16:10.818 --> 16:21.571
boy insisted that this was the chapel that he had 
been called. And the fellow said, well, he said,

16:23.834 --> 16:33.145
now, soldier, he said, I believe that God has 
called you to preach. And he may have called you to

16:35.065 --> 16:40.896
preach in a chapel, but that would be between you 
and God. But he said, if God had wanted you to preach

16:43.241 --> 16:53.039
here tonight, he would have told me so I could have 
made better preparation. He said, frankly, I

16:53.961 --> 16:56.466
think you're in the wrong chapel. So

16:56.952 --> 17:07.322
the GI sat there for a little while, he said, and got 
up and left. He said, I don't know whether he found

17:07.382 --> 17:16.570
the right chapel or

17:07.382 --> 17:16.570
not.

17:19.153 --> 17:25.879
It was a hard effort to try to show that we had 
concern. Now, but we had helpers, so to speak, out

17:26.315 --> 17:51.054
in the faculty because we not only would have this 
help in a staff type thing, but each one of these

17:26.315 --> 17:51.054
freshmen had an advisor in the area in which he was 
hoping to major. This was a volunteer professor.

17:55.340 --> 18:07.398
Right, and a freshman entered, was assigned to the 
basic division, and to leave the basic division

17:55.340 --> 18:07.398
had to have how many hours and what kind of grades? 
He had to have 30 hours and 30 grade points. Okay,

18:12.005 --> 18:14.849
and then could enter whatever major. Yes, yes. And 
that program lasted until about when, the basic

18:16.592 --> 18:20.217
division? It lasted through 59. 59. And on 
September the 1st, 1960, then the academic

18:24.657 --> 18:36.713
supervision went to the college concerned. And 
then a counseling and testing center was

18:37.374 --> 18:42.701
established. And I was made director of it. Now 
who, as far as you know, who were the primary people

18:45.124 --> 18:49.630
who... were responsible for those changes? I 
think it came out of the concern. I don't think this

18:58.805 --> 19:01.028
was an ugly thing at all. I think the concern was 
that here we are in this college and we have little

19:01.509 --> 19:18.435
or no control over the entering students and this 
sort of thing. We believe that we could at least do

19:18.820 --> 19:28.248
as well as the people that are doing it. They said, 
we are not trying to take over the guidance

19:28.348 --> 19:34.253
function. That's the last thing we want. And so 
Dean Huber gumshoed this. He, for President

19:45.182 --> 19:48.405
Rudder, he was the one that did the organizing, and 
he

19:48.841 --> 19:56.831
had a lot to do with it. But he established a 
committee that was made up of, frankly, the

19:59.535 --> 20:15.135
professors that would be handling this in 
agriculture, all of these colleges. And we worked

20:15.841 --> 20:29.238
all morning, once a week, all during the spring 
semester of 59, getting ready for the transition.

20:29.599 --> 20:29.799
All right. What were your first impressions of 
this new president named Earl Runner? Well,

20:36.067 --> 20:45.139
my impression was that here's a person who knows 
where they're going. And they are going to be fair,

20:46.098 --> 20:55.349
but they have high standards. Did you all have the 
impression that he was sent here, he was selected

20:55.369 --> 21:06.843
for some kind of particular function, reason, 
purpose?

21:10.107 --> 21:11.488
No, I don't think so. Because, frankly... he came 
after we were going as a counseling center.

21:24.834 --> 21:32.503
But our feeling was that he supported a counseling 
center, but he had very high standards. And Frank

21:33.725 --> 21:37.349
Hubert, your first impressions of him? Oh, well, 
Dean Hubert has always impressed me as an

21:38.010 --> 21:44.438
excellent leader. He's careful. I know because 
all during those months in 59,

21:50.619 --> 22:13.986
well, he would have me over one morning a week, and

21:50.619 --> 22:13.986
my job was to give him complete orientation to a 
counseling center and what all can be done. And

22:17.573 --> 22:19.915
this was over in his office in Nagle Hall. Because 
during that first year, I, as a beginning faculty

22:20.676 --> 22:37.593
member,

22:20.676 --> 22:37.593
being able to be here only because a faculty member 
named John Hill was on leave at the University of

22:20.676 --> 22:37.593
Houston, and I occupied his office, which was 
right next door. And the only reason that I got a

22:38.314 --> 22:41.037
nice office. Describe Hubert's other 
characteristics, sense of humor and techniques

22:42.063 --> 22:50.495
and so forth. Well, Dean Hubert, I remember we were 
walking back from a meeting, Dean Hubert, Dr.

22:59.427 --> 23:06.718
Ransom, and myself, and

22:59.427 --> 23:06.718
Cliff wanted to talk to him. And... We were walking 
along there and Dean Hubert said, now Cliff, what

23:09.265 --> 23:16.717
is this arm twisting you want to do? What was he? And 
I thought, boy, that's a pretty direct way of going

23:19.141 --> 23:26.152
about this sort of thing. Well, I found also from, 
he had, he was a man of high standards. And he told

23:36.046 --> 23:39.409
you what he needed. And he never tried to tell you 
how to do it. He just, this is what I need. Could he

23:50.620 --> 23:52.942
get to the point rather quickly? Yes. Yes. As a 
matter of fact, I think if he started something

23:55.765 --> 24:05.074
like that, I knew to move on. But he was, now he is all 
business. I think he's the type of person who says,

24:11.332 --> 24:15.758
when you're working, you work. One of the little 
things I've been trying to discover, if possible,

24:18.341 --> 24:33.219
that I have not yet, is how Frank Hubert, then the 
superintendent of schools in Orange, got

24:18.341 --> 24:33.219
identified to come over here as dean of arts and 
sciences. Do you have any idea... I think I have an

24:35.767 --> 24:41.098
observation on that. It

24:41.118 --> 24:53.063
is my understanding that President Rutter wanted 
to get a dean. See, education was under him. I

24:56.911 --> 25:04.539
wanted to get a dean that was well known in the 
public schools of the state. See, we were trying to

25:05.159 --> 25:11.666
break in on

25:05.159 --> 25:11.666
this problem. In 1960,

25:12.587 --> 25:19.854
Dean Hubert sort of ramrodded this. But I was the 
one to turn the crank. we wanted to get something

25:24.805 --> 25:39.743
out that we could send to the high schools that 
would give them a reason to know us and know about

25:24.805 --> 25:39.743
us. So I suggested that we develop a counselor's 
handbook.

25:47.772 --> 25:51.657
What would you want in a counselor's handbook if 
you were a high school counselor to help. So Dean

25:56.549 --> 26:03.059
Hubert approved it, said get with it. So we first 
invited people in the state that were connected

26:03.079 --> 26:20.665
with education and we wanted to know us. We had 
people here from the Texas Education Agency. We

26:26.783 --> 26:32.048
chose outstanding counselors of high schools 
from different parts of the state. And we had about

26:33.249 --> 26:37.653
20 people that came to the campus. We paid their 
expenses. And we asked them to help us get the broad

26:41.096 --> 26:50.044
outline of what should be in a counselor's 
handbook. This was a good meeting. President

26:54.077 --> 26:57.302
Rutter came to the meeting. I worked hard. I bought 
some of the maroon briefcases over at the exchange

26:58.424 --> 27:13.247
store, and the girls glued the seal on the outside 
of it. So when they all came in that morning at every

27:13.267 --> 27:17.213
table, There was a nice case for them to put their 
things in. We also saw that they, everywhere they

27:24.716 --> 27:31.806
went, they would take them. I mean, it was going to 
meet us. We had some head honchos out of the Texas

27:37.253 --> 27:43.521
Education Agency, and they were very helpful. 
Well, for instance, this counselor down in

27:44.412 --> 27:59.405
Galveston said, I never dreamed that you had these 
kinds of facilities here.

28:00.226 --> 28:04.690
So we published that counselor's handbook. It was 
a real neat little handbook. And we found out later

28:07.132 --> 28:14.098
that the University of Southern California was 
the only other a university that was doing a

28:14.551 --> 28:20.480
similar thing, and we exchanged counselors' 
handbooks. Well, we put out about, and by the way,

28:21.281 --> 28:33.100
the information service of the campus helped us 
tremendously. There was a lady over in the

28:33.120 --> 28:38.989
agriculture, Mrs. Holland, that helped a lot. As a 
matter of fact, the second one that we put out, we

28:43.036 --> 28:50.945
profited a lot from the first. You mean profited in 
experience? Yes. Not dollars. No, no. As a matter

28:54.869 --> 28:57.131
of fact, we... You gave them. Oh yes, these were 
gifts that we sent to the school. The second one

29:05.361 --> 29:07.443
went over well. Now, I would I would write each dean 
of a college and say, what would you want to be seen

29:09.884 --> 29:25.963
and read about your college in a counselor's 
handbook? I remember that Dean Pearson.

29:33.152 --> 29:33.572
Business. Business. Dean Pearson. I'll always 
remember him as the man that would comment, we've

29:37.222 --> 29:44.869
lost the fox. You know, we'd get to arguing and we'd 
get off somewhere. Well, I sent to each associate

29:49.294 --> 29:58.162
dean and said, read this over. Change it any way you 
want to. But I want to be sure that you feel

30:01.606 --> 30:06.250
comfortable about what was written. Business 
just sent theirs back.

30:14.094 --> 30:17.938
They sent it back with no changes. So we put it in 
there. Well, when the thing was published, the

30:20.401 --> 30:28.189
colleges all got copies, and the phone rang. And I 
answered it, and Dean Pearson, boy, he was pretty

30:29.750 --> 30:36.017
hot, I said. Dean Pearson, your office approved 
what was written. I have it here in the file. He

30:47.485 --> 30:48.566
said, is that right? I said, yes. He said, well, 
I'll talk another way. He said that the next one of

30:54.653 --> 31:01.380
these you publish, I... I want to be sure that we do 
it right. I said, well, I sure am sorry it happened

31:05.062 --> 31:09.366
too. Now, when I was ready to publish a third one, 
this was about 1970, 71. I don't know, over in the

31:16.732 --> 31:29.224
structure of the university somewhere, they 
established this kind of information office or

31:16.732 --> 31:29.224
something. And so I was told to refer my plan to 
them. Well, I did, and I got back a note that said,

31:35.835 --> 31:45.441
all of this is in the college catalog, and they 
wouldn't do it.
