WEBVTT

00:02.039 --> 00:04.681
Hall can tell you, Hall was my hero.

00:04.741 --> 00:07.304
He used to stand up there and shout.

00:07.344 --> 00:09.526
He was the first guy who gave me a geography list.

00:09.986 --> 00:15.190
Bazell Hall was across the avenue, and he would scream, Vietnamese, release our flyers.

00:17.412 --> 00:19.194
I said, what the hell is a Vietnamese?

00:19.214 --> 00:20.695
He said, man, they're from Vietnam.

00:21.176 --> 00:22.197
Don't you read the paper?

00:24.078 --> 00:25.439
This was back in the 50s.

00:27.141 --> 00:28.642
The French were getting their butt whipped.

00:28.682 --> 00:31.945
Evidently, we had some guys over there flying, and they had captured them.

00:32.347 --> 00:36.113
What did you guys do during a basketball game at G. Raleigh?

00:36.133 --> 00:37.095
Oh, went and raised hell.

00:37.135 --> 00:42.463
You know, we knew all the basketball players and, you know, we'd take turns hazing them or hazing the other team.

00:42.583 --> 00:48.412
The football team sat right behind the opponent's bench and leather lunged them.

00:48.432 --> 00:51.317
And, you know, your job was to get under their skin.

00:51.736 --> 00:58.369
That's where I wasn't much of an athlete, but I was a, I was all-conference at Leather Lungen people, you know.

00:59.070 --> 01:02.577
Did Leffler, Coach Leffler, identify with the student body very well?

01:03.138 --> 01:03.639
Not really.

01:04.240 --> 01:06.826
If he did, I never caught him at it.

01:07.567 --> 01:13.238
He was, yeah, he was an Eastern guy that, uh, uh,

01:14.585 --> 01:19.010
I don't think he was a happy man there.

01:19.311 --> 01:24.917
And you stayed with the track team your sophomore year?

01:25.218 --> 01:27.120
Yeah.

01:27.500 --> 01:31.725
I tore my hamstring again my sophomore year and that was, you know.

01:31.785 --> 01:32.106
That was it.

01:32.486 --> 01:33.087
That was it.

01:34.168 --> 01:36.711
Then when you go home that summer, did you go to summer camp?

01:37.231 --> 01:38.934
Yeah, I went to summer camp.

01:38.994 --> 01:41.118
Describe summer camp for you as an Aggie.

01:41.378 --> 01:43.481
Well, it was wonderful.

01:43.582 --> 01:46.967
We went to Fort Sill?

01:46.987 --> 01:47.468
No, no, no.

01:47.488 --> 01:48.690
I'm an Air Force pal.

01:48.710 --> 01:48.891
Oh.

01:49.732 --> 01:52.096
So, we went out.

01:52.276 --> 01:56.303
And of course, being from A&M, and you have all these Air Force ROTC guys, you know.

01:56.924 --> 01:58.588
We're cock of the walk out there.

01:58.628 --> 02:02.977
We went to a couple of different bases.

02:03.057 --> 02:04.721
Which one?

02:04.781 --> 02:06.565
We were out near Las Vegas.

02:07.086 --> 02:11.997
We went down to Florida to

02:11.977 --> 02:16.723
down there by, went to the beach.

02:16.743 --> 02:22.910
Boy, they had a great beach down there at, I think it's Eglin, maybe, that's down there.

02:23.331 --> 02:23.932
Pensacola?

02:25.093 --> 02:25.974
In that area.

02:25.994 --> 02:28.637
I'm trying to remember the little town that's there.

02:28.798 --> 02:31.481
I went back with a buddy who has a beach house down there now.

02:31.861 --> 02:33.543
First time I'd been back in a long time.

02:34.204 --> 02:40.532
But, you know, the thing I remember most about it is, you know, we knew how to march, make up a bed,

02:40.867 --> 02:41.989
shine our brass.

02:42.149 --> 02:43.932
We stood out from all the rest of them.

02:43.952 --> 02:45.014
You know, we were the top cadet.

02:45.034 --> 02:51.765
Well, if you were the top cadet every week, the top cadet got to go down the gunnery range with an F-100.

02:51.905 --> 02:56.833
And, of course, they tried to make everybody sick, you know.

02:57.286 --> 02:59.350
And he who bars has to clean it up.

02:59.831 --> 03:04.881
And boy I really bore down because I wanted that ride in that F-100 and I got to do that.

03:05.122 --> 03:08.428
And that was a big thrill until I got to fly the F-16.

03:08.489 --> 03:11.996
Now that, you know, in between those two things technology changed.

03:12.016 --> 03:15.182
That was a Model A compared to that F-16.

03:15.302 --> 03:18.388
Were you a proud Aggie at summer camp?

03:18.589 --> 03:19.210
Oh yeah.

03:19.730 --> 03:23.756
I mean, you know, we were the top cadets.

03:24.276 --> 03:37.715
And they were, you know, if they were ground pounders or air crappers, whatever they were, when you, you know, the things that you were learning and that you took for granted at A&M, you found out, you know, separated you from the crowd.

03:38.156 --> 03:43.944
Did the leadership that was there, the active duty people, did they seem to have a respect for Aggies?

03:44.184 --> 03:44.865
Well, hell yes.

03:45.046 --> 03:48.150
I mean, that's, they were the ones grading our paper.

03:48.890 --> 03:56.598
And that was, you know, Haskell, if we had had a war, there's not a doubt in my mind, I would have been a fire pilot ace.

03:57.859 --> 04:04.346
Because, you know, they took crazy people in, you know, that were like that.

04:04.706 --> 04:10.532
In a peacetime ROTC at Texas A&M, they changed it.

04:10.632 --> 04:16.018
My junior year, they said, we don't want all these hell raisers holding, they're teaching the wrong things.

04:16.478 --> 04:18.340
Everybody here, you know, they had a,

04:18.995 --> 04:24.662
A multi-engine attitude is what we refer to.

04:25.063 --> 04:27.626
You know, that guy's got a multi-engine attitude.

04:27.646 --> 04:31.872
And A&M produced fighter pilots.

04:32.573 --> 04:38.961
Now they had to comb the ranks to find some Percy Mims and guys like good guys, but that were

04:39.295 --> 04:51.600
I'll tell you, the cadet commander of our senior year just, you know, had a distinguished career with Texas, a great guy, Bill Hyatt.

04:51.884 --> 04:58.451
We're up for our reunion last year, let's see, 1960 to... That's H-Y-E.

04:58.491 --> 05:00.753
Yeah, H-Y-E, Bill.

05:01.614 --> 05:04.677
1960, I guess 2000, we're up for our 40-year reunion.

05:05.518 --> 05:08.261
And I said, you know, I want to do this thing where we raise the money.

05:08.321 --> 05:10.804
I've got Mickey Hershkowitz writing a book about 3019.

05:10.964 --> 05:19.393
I said, recently they were talking about changing the name of the Joe Route on the other side to making it Kimbrough over there.

05:20.294 --> 05:21.435
And I said...

05:21.685 --> 05:27.993
held nine of the regents, and the chancellor of the university did not know who John Kimbrough was.

05:28.094 --> 05:30.797
And I said, well, who is John Kimbrough?

05:31.278 --> 05:36.104
I said, you know, you goddamn grade point queer, that's, you know, you've just proved my point.

05:37.126 --> 05:38.568
We used to drown high out.

05:38.988 --> 05:45.617
He was, you know, a guy, he and a bunch of those guys got vaulted over everybody because

05:46.357 --> 05:47.700
They were neat dressers.

05:48.401 --> 05:49.644
They kept their nose clean.

05:49.684 --> 05:50.946
They studied all the time.

05:51.628 --> 05:56.838
And the, and the tack officer loved them because they didn't give them any trouble.

05:57.379 --> 06:00.385
Meanwhile, you know, we were drowning out the tack officers.

06:00.686 --> 06:02.028
Poor old Colonel Melcher.

06:02.329 --> 06:04.433
We had a water fight and I didn't know it was him.

06:04.953 --> 06:07.116
and had one of those trash cans full of water.

06:07.176 --> 06:08.598
He's coming in to stop it.

06:09.038 --> 06:16.288
It hit him on it first and it knocked his hat just all the way down his neck, knocked the top of it out.

06:17.169 --> 06:18.651
And we're up on the roof.

06:19.032 --> 06:22.556
And we just thought as a guy, you couldn't tell from up there, you know, at night.

06:23.177 --> 06:30.707
And he comes up on the roof and there he is dripping wet with all that scrambled eggs knocked off down around his neck.

06:31.244 --> 06:35.350
And he later thought it was, I mean, Melcher, you know, he was a hell raiser.

06:35.410 --> 06:45.465
They said his ass looked like somebody played bumbly peg on it because he put on boots and walked down the senior walk near the elephant walk as a freshman.

06:45.485 --> 06:51.093
They look back, here comes freshman Melcher, you know, and he said, now that's, you've gone too far.

06:51.454 --> 06:55.059
But Melcher had some fire in his ass and he appreciated other people that did.

06:55.480 --> 06:56.762
Those were my heroes.

06:57.302 --> 07:01.048
And that's who I patterned myself after and thought that was,

07:01.028 --> 07:04.271
You know, fun, I mean, there was a time to raise hell in a play.

07:04.972 --> 07:07.955
You know, it's like Bob Bob Black Sheep and that bunch.

07:09.297 --> 07:10.578
You know, the flying tigers.

07:11.399 --> 07:13.121
My brother flew during World War II.

07:13.561 --> 07:16.965
And that shaped my attitudes about what pilots are supposed to be.

07:17.445 --> 07:22.611
And they're not guys that, you know, run around with their shirt-tailed, tucked in, kissing somebody's ass.

07:23.011 --> 07:28.757
They're people that know you party like hell and then, you know, you fly like hell.

07:29.007 --> 07:37.461
Now, you come back as a junior, and do you— Immediately— Is that when you have the conversation with Rudder, or is it your senior year?

07:37.502 --> 07:37.762
No, no, no.

07:37.782 --> 07:39.004
It's going into my senior year.

07:39.485 --> 07:42.650
I was there the fall of my junior year, and that's when H.L.

07:42.690 --> 07:43.432
Heaton— Oh.

07:43.973 --> 07:48.100
I was hot and heavy with this girl down in Austin, and that's when I had the thing.

07:48.120 --> 07:51.285
The prof wouldn't let me take the finals, said I wasn't Jack Raines.

07:51.265 --> 07:54.250
That became a big, you know, they talked about it at the business school.

07:54.330 --> 08:02.784
He evidently came up with some faculty thing, and he got on my record, and I mean, that's when he said, you know, this is exactly the kind of son of a bitch we need to get out of here.

08:02.804 --> 08:04.768
They had the Corps was changing all this.

08:05.088 --> 08:12.180
This guy's a hell raiser, and he's a bad influence in the Corps, and these guys, you know, we've got to break this up, da-da, da-da, da-da.

08:12.200 --> 08:13.061
So you go to Lamar Tech?

08:13.262 --> 08:15.265
They throw my ass out of there.

08:15.245 --> 08:17.768
All right, and then you come back as a senior?

08:17.968 --> 08:27.118
Yeah, I made top grades at Lamar, and my mother comes up to see Rudder, unbeknownst to me, and Rudder just, you know, looks at my transcript, looks at everything.

08:27.739 --> 08:43.497
Later on, you know, Margaret said, Earl said they probably shouldn't have thrown you out, and at any other time they wouldn't have, but you were visible, you were a leader for the kind of things they didn't want leadership in, and that, uh,

08:44.152 --> 08:50.101
You were better off gone, because see, you know, your junior year they decided who's going to lead everything on senior year.

08:50.662 --> 08:54.988
Well, I was exactly the kind of guy they didn't want.

08:55.008 --> 08:57.292
So you come back in the fall of 59?

08:57.312 --> 09:01.418
59 as a slick-sleeved

09:01.769 --> 09:04.133
DNC in the Corps, derailing ceremony.

09:04.153 --> 09:05.636
But you lived over in the Corps area?

09:05.656 --> 09:06.798
Sure, with my buddies.

09:06.918 --> 09:10.304
I mean, you know, it's still all male, all military.

09:10.564 --> 09:11.446
I'm not a veteran.

09:11.766 --> 09:15.693
How did, how had your attitude and behavior changed?

09:15.713 --> 09:25.269
Well, at that time, you know, I said, man, you know, there's no way I'm going to, you know, I'm going to make it in this military environment.

09:25.309 --> 09:26.832
So then they came back and they said,

09:27.942 --> 09:29.805
They, you know, they had invested in me.

09:30.265 --> 09:31.968
They said, we've got an investment in you.

09:33.350 --> 09:40.360
Said, if you'll take a category one flight contract, we'll reinstate you.

09:41.843 --> 09:43.525
But it would have gone to five years.

09:44.186 --> 09:47.571
And I had originally started on a three year, and I said, well, I'll do the three years.

09:47.804 --> 09:53.751
So we negotiate through, you know, I had a series of meetings and, you know, I wanted them to honor my three year deal.

09:53.771 --> 09:56.134
They said, no, you know, I knew things five years.

09:56.154 --> 09:57.675
I said, well, that's for the people to start now.

09:57.716 --> 10:00.839
Well, you're really starting again and you ought to do it five years.

10:00.859 --> 10:02.401
So this argument goes on.

10:02.421 --> 10:11.792
Long story short, I wind up in my senior year, I'm graduating from A&M and... You ready?

10:11.812 --> 10:12.012
Yeah.

10:12.092 --> 10:12.993
I'll wrap this up.

10:13.013 --> 10:16.157
I'm graduating from A&M and they're...

10:16.137 --> 10:17.819
I'm not going to get any kind of contract.

10:17.839 --> 10:19.321
So they write my draft board.

10:19.561 --> 10:20.422
I graduated.

10:21.323 --> 10:33.057
Before they averaged in all my hours I transferred and my correspondence course, I had one extra grade point.

10:33.077 --> 10:39.023
Were you a member of any extracurricular activity group, organization?

10:41.386 --> 10:44.710
MSC organizations or anything?

10:45.736 --> 10:47.578
Oh, you'd have to look in the annual.

10:47.658 --> 10:49.180
I can't remember what I listed there.

10:49.220 --> 10:57.309
Basically, I spend most of my time trying to stay off campus, go to Austin.

10:58.130 --> 11:02.956
Did you go to any local religious events?

11:03.776 --> 11:04.057
No.

11:04.738 --> 11:10.544
Haskell, my sister, who was big in the Church of Christ and all that bunch, they beat on me pretty good.

11:10.604 --> 11:13.127
I was going through a period in my life where I

11:13.765 --> 11:37.967
I'd been raised in a very strict upbringing and I was trying to put as much distance between me and that structure as I could and that was, I was very irregular church attendance at the time and so about the things that

11:38.504 --> 11:49.626
The core, athletics, and my buddies, I was not a very good Aggie in the traditional sense.

11:49.806 --> 11:52.592
I was a student leader.

11:55.297 --> 12:00.968
Someone said they had a thing who was the best known people in the class.

12:01.049 --> 12:03.435
You know, this was in the reunion.

12:03.475 --> 12:05.541
They said, Reigns, you held no officers.

12:05.561 --> 12:06.403
You did nothing.

12:06.804 --> 12:10.634
It said, but everyone knew you because you were a legend on campus.

12:11.416 --> 12:17.050
And I'm afraid my legend status, Mirsky, Myers, and I,

12:17.654 --> 12:24.742
We were legends of the wrong type, and they probably did everyone a favor trying to weed us all out.

12:25.303 --> 12:28.627
I didn't become a leader until I went to law school.

12:28.647 --> 12:33.272
I got out, got married, worked, went back to law school.

12:33.312 --> 12:39.619
Now, when I was in law school, I was president of the student government.

12:42.002 --> 12:44.725
So when I got to law school, you know,

12:45.228 --> 12:49.792
I applied myself both as a student and as a student leader.

12:52.975 --> 12:59.502
So I got to lead the delegation back to SCONA, the U of H delegation.

12:59.822 --> 13:07.409
And I was named a Who's Who in American Colleges and Universities from the University of Houston, not from A&M.

13:07.429 --> 13:11.353
So it's really a tale of two cities.

13:12.363 --> 13:15.731
In that era, how did you and your buddies get blind dates?

13:16.674 --> 13:18.077
We didn't get blind dates.

13:18.097 --> 13:19.380
Oh, you didn't get any blind dates?

13:20.223 --> 13:25.275
No, I mean that, meeting girls was never a problem.

13:25.913 --> 13:29.038
When they came to College Station, where did they stay?

13:29.218 --> 13:30.620
Where did they spend the night?

13:30.640 --> 13:33.184
I always held out for a motel.

13:33.224 --> 13:35.728
Their parents wanted them to stay at some prof's house.

13:36.229 --> 13:41.757
My freshman year, I parked a couple of girls at prof's houses, as was the custom then.

13:42.458 --> 13:44.201
But boy, that was worse, dating them at home.

13:44.241 --> 13:47.466
They could stay out later at home than they could there.

13:47.446 --> 13:49.488
And it was pretty confining.

13:49.909 --> 14:03.023
And so, you know, the big breakthrough was when you could get one that could come down, that could stay, you know, get a motel room, put a couple of girls there, and we'd have parties at the motels.

14:03.103 --> 14:07.528
And that was wild big time stuff in Bryan College Station.

14:08.770 --> 14:12.694
What were the big social events that Aggies went to?

14:13.248 --> 14:16.172
They were called Austin and Houston.

14:16.232 --> 14:18.275
Those were the big social events.

14:18.295 --> 14:21.058
Sin Alley in Houston was a big social event.

14:21.479 --> 14:26.345
All those apartments out there where the stewardesses were around Love Field were big social events.

14:27.166 --> 14:32.694
Austin with all of its sorority houses and the things that went on at the lake.

14:33.495 --> 14:39.643
College Station was, it was pretty drab back in the 50s, Haskell.

14:40.248 --> 14:43.972
When Aggies drank, what were their favorite beverages?

14:44.813 --> 14:46.395
Anything that was cheap.

14:47.456 --> 14:51.260
If you could get a keg of beer, you know, you brought the price down.

14:52.582 --> 15:02.512
You'd go out to, there was a, we'd go out to Whiskey Bridge and the cheapest thing they sold by the court was called Old Crab Orchard.

15:03.574 --> 15:09.360
And it was about two degrees this side of rubbing alcohol, all with food coloring.

15:09.948 --> 15:11.209
It was bad stuff.

15:13.251 --> 15:14.252
Varnish remover.

15:14.292 --> 15:16.415
Did they drink that straight or did they pour it into?

15:17.936 --> 15:20.339
You poured anything.

15:21.240 --> 15:23.862
Some of them made bathtub gin.

15:24.663 --> 15:32.591
If you had a chemical engineering major in the outfits, you'd produce all sorts of wonderful things and wash tubs.

15:32.651 --> 15:35.314
It's a wonder all of us didn't go blind or something.

15:35.294 --> 15:39.195
mixing fat batches for parties, you know.

15:39.497 --> 15:40.663
What did people smoke?

15:42.415 --> 15:47.082
Well, one of my jobs up there is Marlboro made me a distributor of free cigarettes.

15:47.162 --> 15:49.045
I was very popular that semester.

15:51.169 --> 15:53.272
You know, mostly OPs.

15:53.292 --> 15:54.293
Those were other people.

15:55.115 --> 15:57.519
Cigarettes, you know, buying cigarettes.

15:57.539 --> 16:03.187
And I didn't smoke when I, you know, when I was jocking around.

16:03.247 --> 16:05.571
I was not much of a smoker in college.

16:05.720 --> 16:09.905
All right, those who did, though, they're smoking cigarettes, pipes?

16:11.046 --> 16:14.190
Oh, there were a couple of pretentious people who wanted to smoke a pipe.

16:14.270 --> 16:14.811
Cigars?

16:14.831 --> 16:17.854
They were the same kind of guys that, you know, had big keychains.

16:19.156 --> 16:20.257
Cigars?

16:20.398 --> 16:35.035
Yeah, we'd smoke cigars at Bonfire, or if you went out on a beer bust, we'd go out to the clay pits, you know, get barbecue from Duncan Mess Hall and a keg of beer and go out to the clay pits.

16:35.015 --> 16:40.801
bring cigars and tell lies to each other.

16:40.921 --> 16:44.064
What drugs did Aggies even know existed then?

16:45.105 --> 16:45.806
Study pills.

16:45.846 --> 16:50.270
They sold them at the North Gate and you could buy them.

16:50.290 --> 16:54.034
They were called study pills and it was just pure old speed.

16:54.354 --> 16:58.518
You'd take a couple of those and you couldn't get your eyes closed for two days.

16:58.578 --> 16:59.559
You were wired.

16:59.619 --> 17:03.283
Did y'all even know the word heroin or marijuana?

17:03.331 --> 17:14.427
I mean, I knew what marijuana was from Port Arthur, and heroin was something that, you know, you knew about people taking who were dope fiends, that's what you called them.

17:14.467 --> 17:20.415
Some dope fiend might take heroin, but there was not a drug culture.

17:20.655 --> 17:26.183
I mean, the drug of choice was keg beer.

17:28.188 --> 17:31.752
There was some drinking, but not like when my kids went to school up there.

17:31.772 --> 17:39.340
Boy, I think they have a real drinking problem on college campuses now where people just drink to distraction.

17:40.281 --> 17:42.343
We couldn't have ever afforded to get that drunk.

17:44.706 --> 17:49.591
The beer was 20 cents, or 19, something like that.

17:49.671 --> 17:55.157
So you take a dollar and have five beers, and if you hadn't gotten a buzz off five beers, there's something wrong with you.

17:55.542 --> 18:03.990
If I had wanted to be a highly recognized student leader in those days, what office or position would I have sought?

18:04.010 --> 18:11.418
Well, when I got down there our freshman year, you know, be a company commander was, that was, you know, a great job.

18:11.438 --> 18:12.539
You had your own outfit.

18:12.779 --> 18:18.004
You know, the further up the pecking order, staff positions were kind of ceremonial.

18:18.545 --> 18:21.648
Guys, you had a little staff, but the company commander ran his outfit.

18:22.349 --> 18:24.891
And it was real hands-on management experience.

18:25.192 --> 18:29.498
And was the corps commander the most visible student leader?

18:31.461 --> 18:32.041
Definitely.

18:32.102 --> 18:36.728
I mean, he was the guy that was always, you know, hobnobbing with the presidents and that sort of thing.

18:37.128 --> 18:48.284
There was always within the corps there was really, there was the leadership that had the approval of the college and then there was the leadership.

18:50.166 --> 18:53.511
And in my freshman and sophomore year they were damn near one and the same.

18:53.862 --> 19:00.769
By my junior and senior year, there really evolved a differentiation because we went through a transition.

19:01.109 --> 19:02.851
I don't know how it is, you know, now.

19:03.692 --> 19:08.116
As far as you and your buddies knew, how did you get to be one of those leaders?

19:08.476 --> 19:09.337
What was the track?

19:10.018 --> 19:13.561
Well, it started off, it was peer approval my freshman and sophomore year.

19:14.322 --> 19:20.628
And then it changed, you know, the, you know, the seniors didn't pick the junior leaders.

19:20.668 --> 19:22.430
The juniors didn't pick sophomore leaders.

19:22.450 --> 19:23.751
Sophomore didn't, you know,

19:23.984 --> 19:28.689
It had changed to the TAC officers ran everything, and they made the decision.

19:29.609 --> 19:35.975
And it was generally on who they thought had grades and would listen to and follow directions.

19:36.476 --> 19:41.881
I always, even in grade school, got a needs improvement and listens to and follows directions.

19:44.203 --> 19:49.589
How prestigious or how visible were the Yale leaders, the band members?

19:49.609 --> 19:53.232
Oh, the Yale leaders, you know, they're popularly elected by students.

19:53.701 --> 19:57.526
I mean, they were real student leaders, you know, that were selected there.

19:57.646 --> 20:08.780
People... Student government was not that big a deal in my eyes at A&M because, you know, that was kind of something that they met and talked about, you know, bullshit.

20:09.360 --> 20:21.175
I mean, everything happened around the core, and that was... We were more like a Greek model of city-states that existed, the outfits out there.

20:22.577 --> 20:23.438
You know, it took...

20:23.924 --> 20:27.213
It took a foreign army to unite us.

20:27.333 --> 20:29.600
The Longhorns could unite all Aggies.

20:30.021 --> 20:34.373
When we were left alone, we were fighting amongst ourselves and drowning each other out.

20:34.623 --> 20:42.852
Did you and your buddies have a high regard for the band, for the scene cadets, for the MSC leadership?

20:43.532 --> 20:47.437
Well, I mean, I, you know, admire and respected those guys because they got their job done.

20:47.477 --> 20:48.638
The band did a great job.

20:49.038 --> 20:52.102
You know, we drowned them out and called them BQs and all that kind of stuff.

20:52.122 --> 20:54.204
But it was, you know, it was good bullshit back and forth.

20:55.025 --> 21:00.090
And as far as the people that ran the MSC, we thought that was...

21:00.070 --> 21:06.340
you know, important because, you know, we'd lobby them for who we wanted on campus, this, that, and the other.

21:06.360 --> 21:10.848
Did you know then or later about any Aggie secret fraternities?

21:11.529 --> 21:14.333
If they existed, it was obviously not on the inside.

21:14.393 --> 21:18.400
I mean, I think that was before my time we heard about all that stuff.

21:19.055 --> 21:21.678
If there were secret fraternities, I wasn't aware of it.

21:22.659 --> 21:23.660
Totally escaped me.

21:24.821 --> 21:25.061
All right.

21:26.143 --> 21:27.945
The notable people on the campus.

21:28.826 --> 21:34.812
This man, Rudder, when did you, as far as you know, when did you first hear about him coming to A&M?

21:34.832 --> 21:35.333
Do you remember?

21:35.773 --> 21:36.013
Yeah.

21:36.033 --> 21:37.695
I mean, he was just bigger than life.

21:37.735 --> 21:39.097
You know, there's Earl Rudder.

21:40.438 --> 21:41.840
I mean, he's General Rudder.

21:42.480 --> 21:46.885
And there was, you knew him, you made, there was never any doubt about who was in charge.

21:47.540 --> 21:50.185
Earl Rutter was a man's man.

21:51.186 --> 21:56.856
And he didn't have to tell you, you know, he was, you know, I am the president here or anything.

21:56.896 --> 21:59.521
He walked in the room, you knew who in the hell the president was.

22:00.583 --> 22:04.049
I used to say, they said, well, when you went to China, how did you figure out who was in charge?

22:04.089 --> 22:05.051
I said, it's real simple.

22:05.672 --> 22:09.919
You know, who sits down first and who goes through the door first.

22:10.102 --> 22:15.117
I mean, they all look alike, but you know, there's a pecking order.

22:15.138 --> 22:18.388
You remember I told you I learned about pecking orders early on as a boy.

22:19.170 --> 22:22.761
And when you had that, for you, life-changing

22:23.433 --> 22:28.043
session with him, how did you get invited to that?

22:28.063 --> 22:31.710
Your mother went... Well, mother had talked to him about me getting back in school.

22:31.871 --> 22:33.153
Did you get a letter from him?

22:33.314 --> 22:37.983
No, he sent a telegram to be in his office at 0800 hours on such and such a date.

22:38.063 --> 22:38.885
A telegram?

22:38.905 --> 22:42.673
Yes, sir, you get your ass up here at this time, you know.

22:43.649 --> 22:45.853
And how were you dressed when you went in?

22:45.913 --> 22:46.754
What were you wearing?

22:46.774 --> 22:53.766
I wore a pair of khakis, and I had on, no, I wasn't, you know, this was in the summer.

22:53.886 --> 23:00.237
I had on a pair of khaki pants, like, you know, you wore khakis or blue jeans, and khakis were kind of a dress pant.

23:00.257 --> 23:03.683
I had on a pair of khakis, and I had a, you know, iron shirt.

23:04.253 --> 23:24.186
did look squared away my shoes were shined you know did you have any idea what this meeting was really well i you know i'd made i'd written a letter make an application to be readmitted a and m but i didn't ever you know you didn't know whether it was a yay or nay well but i couldn't imagine the president get involved and you know

23:24.655 --> 23:32.903
I mean, I am like, you know, a whale turd in the ocean, you know, at the deepest part, and the president's going to say something to you.

23:32.923 --> 23:42.732
I mean, that was, I figured, you know, I thought my first reaction is, God, what have we done that they just found out about, and that, you know, he's going to, what they've thrown me out, what else can they do to me?

23:43.652 --> 23:48.097
And I told mother, I said, well, I've got to go to A&M, and she wanted to know what the telegram was about.

23:48.117 --> 23:52.941
She didn't tell me she had talked to Rudder, and I said, well, you know, General Rudder won't sue me.

23:53.478 --> 23:55.421
And she said, well, what do you think it's about?

23:55.441 --> 23:59.148
I said, well, I applied to get back in, but I can't imagine he's concerned about that.

23:59.168 --> 24:02.714
And she said, well, what are you going to do?

24:02.734 --> 24:05.198
I said, well, I'm going to be in his office in 0800 hours.

24:05.358 --> 24:08.984
And I mean, there wasn't any doubt about what I was going to do.

24:09.165 --> 24:12.030
Was this in the Koch building?

24:12.050 --> 24:12.250
Mm-hmm.

24:12.350 --> 24:13.512
No, this was...

24:13.795 --> 24:17.659
He had moved over, he had an office in... The old system building?

24:17.679 --> 24:18.781
The system building then.

24:18.841 --> 24:19.401
What we then called it.

24:19.421 --> 24:20.102
At least, yeah.

24:20.523 --> 24:27.651
I guess, you know, I guess that was, you know, I didn't know where in the hell he officed until, you know, I guess he'd been there all the time.

24:28.852 --> 24:30.654
Do you remember how long the meeting lasted?

24:31.375 --> 24:32.777
Oh, a better part of an hour.

24:33.397 --> 24:33.538
Really?

24:33.558 --> 24:34.018
Oh, yeah.

24:34.739 --> 24:38.123
He spent a lot of time reviewing things with me.

24:38.523 --> 24:39.584
Tell me about this, Raines.

24:39.604 --> 24:41.146
What were you thinking when this happened?

24:41.527 --> 24:42.688
Do you see, you know,

24:43.073 --> 24:46.999
Do you see, you know, if you learned anything, then we'd go to the next one.

24:47.360 --> 24:50.885
And, you know, he'd just give me his view of it and chew on me a little bit more.

24:51.706 --> 24:53.909
And, you know, I can't believe anybody's this dumb.

24:54.030 --> 24:56.453
What were you thinking about?

24:56.473 --> 24:57.735
Now, I've had reports.

24:57.835 --> 24:58.537
I've done a lot of it.

24:58.637 --> 25:00.900
You know, I've had reports about so-and-so and so-and-so.

25:01.221 --> 25:02.623
Is there anything you want to say about that?

25:02.643 --> 25:03.324
No, sir.

25:04.025 --> 25:05.487
Well, are you denying that you did it?

25:06.268 --> 25:06.669
No, sir.

25:07.851 --> 25:08.932
Well, then you did do it.

25:10.475 --> 25:11.376
Well, yes, sir.

25:11.845 --> 25:32.352
near enough that you know i'm not going to argue about it well that's a start you know they can go to the next and he had all kinds of notes you know he talked obviously he talked to my tack officer they accused me of having a girl in a dorm they could never prove it and uh a lot of things like that that were conduct unbecoming

25:33.226 --> 25:38.451
And did he give you any, at the end of it, were there any final words that?

25:38.471 --> 25:39.111
Well, I told you.

25:39.171 --> 25:43.655
He told me, he said, you know, if, you know, should they reach a decision to let you back in here?

25:44.636 --> 25:45.957
You know, what's going to be your attitude?

25:45.977 --> 25:48.019
I said, well, I want to graduate, you know.

25:48.920 --> 25:56.326
I said, General, I'm, you know, getting a degree from A&M has been my mama's goal all of her life, something I want to do, you know.

25:56.866 --> 26:01.390
I was, I said, this is, you know, he said, are you just up here to have a good time or something?

26:01.570 --> 26:02.271
You know.

26:02.622 --> 26:04.584
So you don't seem serious about anything.

26:05.785 --> 26:12.853
You know, everyone says you have leadership ability and you have applied your abilities to lead people in the wrong direction.

26:14.334 --> 26:25.245
You know, everyone says, you know, HL Heaton says that anyone who can maintain the academic record you do with as little effort could be an outstanding student.

26:26.387 --> 26:27.408
What is your program?

26:28.369 --> 26:31.532
What do you, you know, and you know General Rudd, I mean, he could,

26:32.052 --> 26:34.516
He could get to the lower right-hand corner pretty quick.

26:35.898 --> 26:37.580
And were there any last words?

26:37.740 --> 26:43.689
Well, I told you the story that he, the story about somewhere there's a sergeant, you know, it's screwed up.

26:44.210 --> 26:45.311
Did you get that on tape?

26:45.332 --> 26:45.612
Yes.

26:45.632 --> 26:47.475
You want me to, okay, well, you know what that's.

26:48.056 --> 26:48.937
And did, as you walked?

26:49.197 --> 26:51.961
I mean, he focused me as I, you know.

26:53.684 --> 26:56.949
And that conversation did have an effect on your life?

26:56.969 --> 26:59.292
Oh, it stuck with me because I, you know,

26:59.727 --> 27:01.309
It was not a threat.

27:01.349 --> 27:02.831
It was a promise.

27:02.851 --> 27:09.300
He had the means to deliver on that promise, and there was no doubt in my mind that he had the resolve to deliver on that promise.

27:09.620 --> 27:13.906
Now, on the other hand, I wanted to achieve what he was motivating me to achieve.

27:14.326 --> 27:19.053
Now, those two things came together, which helped me make a lot of decisions later on.

27:19.413 --> 27:21.476
Am I going to take off and go to Austin this weekend?

27:21.496 --> 27:24.840
No, I'm going to get my ass ready for that quiz on Monday because I've got to do it.

27:25.421 --> 27:27.103
Am I going to cut that class?

27:27.123 --> 27:28.485
No, I'm going to be in class.

27:28.972 --> 27:29.793
Because H.L.

27:29.833 --> 27:31.655
Heaton called me in when I was readmitted.

27:32.376 --> 27:34.117
And he said, Mr. Raines, I want to tell you something.

27:35.258 --> 27:40.264
I have got you on a watch list, and I'm going to be checking your attendance in every class.

27:40.964 --> 27:45.449
And said, if it were left up to me, and I've told President Roosevelt, I would not admit you.

27:45.949 --> 27:47.531
You know, let's understand each other.

27:47.551 --> 27:51.575
You start cutting classes again, mister, and you won't get to the finals.

27:53.377 --> 27:53.998
So, you know.

27:54.618 --> 27:56.160
So what was your attendance record?

27:56.832 --> 28:00.075
Oh, I think, you know, I got the flu one time.

28:00.095 --> 28:04.679
I had, I mean, so bad I couldn't, you know, I had to walk in pneumonia.

28:05.240 --> 28:09.984
And I missed two or three days classes, went to the quack shack.

28:10.004 --> 28:14.948
They sent me into the, you know, shot me full of antibiotics.

28:14.968 --> 28:17.310
And I said, can I have a doctor's note?

28:17.350 --> 28:18.852
They said, well, you know, you're in college.

28:18.872 --> 28:20.453
I said, I need a note from the doctor.

28:20.473 --> 28:22.475
I sent it over to Sheetan.

28:22.495 --> 28:24.797
I wanted him to know I was really sick.

28:25.402 --> 28:27.589
And how well did you do academically that year?

28:27.609 --> 28:27.931
I did.

28:28.252 --> 28:30.439
I had a very good year, you know.

28:30.459 --> 28:30.961
I had to.

28:31.844 --> 28:35.817
And when you left that day, you drove back to Port Arthur?

28:36.387 --> 28:38.369
That session with Mr. Rutter?

28:38.629 --> 28:40.591
I went over to Austin to see my girlfriend.

28:40.952 --> 28:41.132
Oh, okay.

28:41.152 --> 28:43.494
What did you tell your, when you told your mom?

28:43.514 --> 28:44.956
Well, see, they didn't tell me I was back in.

28:45.216 --> 28:46.297
Oh, oh.

28:46.337 --> 28:48.960
You know, he said, should you be, you know, readmitted?

28:49.140 --> 28:50.622
How did you learn you were back in?

28:50.722 --> 28:54.446
I got a letter that said my application for readmission had been granted.

28:54.466 --> 29:01.433
They had received my transcript from Lamar, because, you know, I had to get that transcript sent up there.

29:01.413 --> 29:05.399
And I really thought I'd go back to A&M and go to summer school.

29:05.840 --> 29:11.990
They wouldn't let me go to summer school, which put me under a lot of pressure my senior year to try to get the required courses.

29:12.371 --> 29:19.422
You had to have, I think you had to have a 1-5 or something in your major, you know.

29:20.583 --> 29:29.011
And for me to get up to a one five, I had to, you know, damn near have a three point from that, you know, to meet all these requirements and get these courses.

29:29.111 --> 29:31.073
It was it was like registration.

29:31.173 --> 29:36.798
OK, you've got to run this and do this all at the same time and balance this on your nose and hop.

29:38.219 --> 29:39.421
That was my senior year.

29:39.461 --> 29:40.922
That senior year you lived on campus.

29:41.202 --> 29:41.763
Absolutely.

29:42.824 --> 29:49.510
You were a drill and ceremonies cadet and participated in all of the

29:49.996 --> 29:52.138
Rituals and activities and so on.

29:52.158 --> 29:53.680
I started off as a slick sleeve.

29:53.720 --> 29:56.884
Somewhere along the way they decided that I'd earn my way to two buttons.

29:57.504 --> 30:02.410
So I became a two button man, which I thought about telling them I wasn't interested in that.

30:02.730 --> 30:05.894
But I thought, no, they'll think that's a bad attitude.

30:06.354 --> 30:10.499
So I took my two buttons with grateful acknowledgement.

30:10.519 --> 30:13.202
Did you get involved in any hazing or...

30:13.182 --> 30:16.567
Let me tell you, the whole time I was there, I was the freshman's friend.

30:17.027 --> 30:26.700
You know, I might stop and bullshit with them or haze them in a sense, or like Ross Margrave, he'll tell you, Ross, you know, there's been a regent up there.

30:26.720 --> 30:40.759
Ross pulled up on campus my senior year, and I looked out, and I didn't have a car on campus, and I looked out, and here's this brand new convertible parked in my parking place that was a sand to me.

30:41.262 --> 30:42.143
Can you watch him?

30:42.484 --> 30:44.447
I'm going to go.

30:44.467 --> 30:44.567
Okay.

30:45.909 --> 30:46.530
Come here.

30:46.550 --> 30:47.511
Make sure he stays in here.

30:47.531 --> 30:48.372
Has he got one?

30:50.676 --> 30:54.601
Yeah, but he could have been in trouble.

30:54.722 --> 30:54.822
Okay.

30:54.842 --> 30:55.843
And so I called the freshman.

30:55.863 --> 30:58.227
I said, see that freshman out there in my parking place?

30:58.247 --> 30:58.908
He said, yes, sir.

30:58.928 --> 31:00.430
He said, I'll go tell him to move.

31:00.450 --> 31:00.811
I said, no.

31:01.471 --> 31:04.095
You tell him to leave that car right there, and you tell him to come up there.

31:04.115 --> 31:05.998
He was out there with his girlfriend, his parents.

31:06.078 --> 31:07.320
I said, see?
