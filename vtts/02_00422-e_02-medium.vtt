WEBVTT

00:01.803 --> 00:04.306
The desires of the wife. When I said, sure, I'd like 
to be chief of staff. And he said, well, you better

00:09.271 --> 00:12.214
talk it over with Mimi. I said, well, I will. And he 
said, better than that. I said, I'm going to talk to

00:15.117 --> 00:16.639
her. So he called her, and she said, oh, yes, we'd be 
delighted to do this. But I sure would like to live

00:22.204 --> 00:24.367
across the street. But we were an island type of 
thing. Across the street, you have privacy, a

00:27.330 --> 00:30.493
backyard up against us. had a big high fence, and it 
was a German field in the back. And for the price, he

00:35.076 --> 00:37.558
said, sure, no problem at all. But he called up to 
get permission. They said, absolutely not. He

00:44.064 --> 00:46.246
said, but he'll move at his own expense. I said, we 
don't care. In principle, we're not making any

00:47.507 --> 00:50.290
movement. If he's there, it's a good policy. You 
can't be moving people all around just because

00:54.294 --> 00:58.658
they'd like a house across the street. But he went 
ahead and went to bat and finally got authority for

00:59.161 --> 01:04.126
us to do that. So Mimi was happy. And later on, I was 
playing golf with

01:06.548 --> 01:18.841
the chief of staff at Heidelberg. We were playing 
out there one day. And he was getting ready to tee

01:22.064 --> 01:25.367
off. It was the first time I'd played with him and 
met him, you know. And he's almost his back sprint.

01:32.007 --> 01:33.169
He said, wait a minute. Is your name Andrews? I 
said, yeah. He said, are you Andrews? And he's

01:37.655 --> 01:40.039
sitting on me, moving across the street. I said, 
I'm guilty. I'm in. He said, you don't know what a

01:41.741 --> 01:44.385
flap you caused on me. He wasn't mad at me at all, but 
he was just retching on me for who I was. And I was the

01:48.871 --> 01:53.338
one that caused this thing. And what helped me 
there, General Sherman, I said, was really

01:53.358 --> 01:58.345
another outstanding person. leader and a 
gentleman. He was hopeful to get the 18th Airborne

02:01.860 --> 02:12.873
Corps at Fort Bragg, and he didn't land to believe 
he would after this assignment. But he got his

02:12.893 --> 02:27.910
assignment instead of being Commanding General 
of the 18th Airborne Corps, he was assigned to

02:12.893 --> 02:27.910
Provo Marshal General in Washington. And there's 
two reasons. One is he didn't like the job in

02:32.019 --> 02:35.063
particular. But he said, why put an infantry 
officer when we have qualified MPs? I think Maples

02:40.711 --> 02:46.378
was an MP, wasn't he, before he became Inspector 
General? Well, I don't know either. It doesn't

02:47.159 --> 02:49.042
make any difference. And he named a BG we had right 
there in Usarua. And he thought he was going to get

02:51.946 --> 02:53.849
them. He said, why don't we get them here? Well, 
they told him like they do anybody, a general law

02:55.649 --> 03:00.176
says to take on it like anybody else. He said, well, 
you'll either accept that job or we'll accept your

03:00.236 --> 03:06.445
retirement. He said, okay, I'll retire. And he 
retired. And sure enough, they had a plan that he

03:12.293 --> 03:14.737
was going to get the Airbnb. This was only a 
temporary job, waiting for somebody else to be

03:15.418 --> 03:21.066
released. So he really outsmarted himself, but he 
was a man of principle, so he retired. So I became

03:27.108 --> 03:34.875
the commanding officer of 7th Army Support 
Command, a major general's position as a colonel.

03:36.256 --> 03:37.337
And I commanded it. Why didn't they send over a 
major general? Well, he wasn't available at the

03:39.560 --> 03:43.884
time. He came about three months later, something 
like that. So General Bruce Clark was the

03:49.092 --> 03:54.599
commanding general of USARUR there in 
Heidelberg. And he used to write me letters. He's a

03:55.920 --> 03:57.082
great letter writer. He'll have a thought during 
the night. Another brilliant individual. And

04:04.791 --> 04:05.632
they called him. They didn't call him back from 
retirement. But instead of retirement, they sent

04:10.058 --> 04:16.225
him to USARUR, waiting for somebody else. I don't 
know what. military politics was, but he was in it.

04:21.829 --> 04:25.213
But he has thoughts on all sorts of things, and he 
writes it. He's a great writer. So he'd write me

04:26.816 --> 04:28.598
letters on the subject. It could be almost 
anything. And it would be addressed, Colonel

04:30.961 --> 04:37.450
Theodore H. Andrews, Commanding General of 7th 
Army Support Command. So...

04:43.733 --> 04:46.015
At least I got a good official report on that. Of 
course, this one was signed by not Bruce Clark, but

04:46.035 --> 05:00.748
Gar Davidson, who was the Seventh Army

04:46.035 --> 05:00.748
Commander. And I think that was a big boost. At this 
time, well, a couple of years later, the United

05:03.450 --> 05:12.778
States was gearing up for Vietnam, and of course, 
support in Europe, the supplies in Europe

05:13.754 --> 05:17.258
declined. Did you have any of that decline while 
you were there from 1960 to 62, or was it two or...

05:18.058 --> 05:23.824
Two or... Still, as far as the Army, or as far as the 
military is concerned, Europe was sort of the

05:25.026 --> 05:32.474
first line of defense. We were still following the 
7th Army Support Command, and we had the

05:32.494 --> 05:40.001
responsibility for supervising.

05:42.664 --> 05:43.525
We positioned two armored division worth of 
equipment in Europe. And that was just building up

05:50.293 --> 05:52.616
for that. And then we had an exercise where they 
exercised one division that got it there. They

05:57.264 --> 06:03.614
brought them over and they took this out of storage 
and went out on maneuvers on that. So we were still,

06:03.634 --> 06:08.382
at that time, building up equipment. But I'm sure 
later on they were drawing down, if they weren't

06:10.707 --> 06:17.997
drawing down that, they were drawing down back 
there in the States in National Guard. Did you have

06:18.217 --> 06:20.220
any relations with the French? While we were 
there? Did you personally deal with any of the

06:24.286 --> 06:29.834
French generals or any colonels, any of their 
officers? Well, we were invited in the French, as

06:29.894 --> 06:38.706
you on the NATO lineup, you've got American zones, 
the French zone, the German zone, British zone. I

06:39.547 --> 06:52.641
was invited one time as a commander, I guess that's 
when I was still in the 18th Infantry, to visit a

06:39.547 --> 06:52.641
demonstration down in the French zone. That's 
about the only time I had. Now, at the camp near

06:54.083 --> 07:00.690
Kaiserslautern, when we first got there, that was 
run by the French. It was called French Camp. But

07:03.073 --> 07:08.659
later on, the Americans took it over completely.

07:08.892 --> 07:12.775
No really direct on a day-to-day relationship. 
Did you deal with any foreign governments at all,

07:12.795 --> 07:21.263
or it was just basically dealing with support, 
right? No, basically it was strictly Seventh

07:21.283 --> 07:23.705
Army. And you had no problems as far as getting a 
proper amount of supplies during this time? Not at

07:32.453 --> 07:34.855
that time. Now, wait a minute. I'm going to 
contradict myself. The equipment of 7th Army,

07:38.778 --> 07:50.570
particularly that which we inherited from the 7th 
Division, was not near up to the standard of the

07:38.778 --> 07:50.570
equipment we had at Fort Ronnie. The jeep were 
tired, deferred maintenance. You've probably

07:54.214 --> 07:56.816
heard that if you've talked to generals. That was 
the rule of the day. Anything could be deferred

08:00.099 --> 08:05.064
because you didn't have spare parts of money for 
it. It would be deferred. We got some new equipment

08:08.461 --> 08:10.103
though. Front line ambulances, for example, we 
got some new equipment. We got a piece of equipment

08:15.149 --> 08:26.223
before we left Raleigh, a little self-propelled 
cannon, which really turned out not to be too good.

08:27.985 --> 08:31.409
So the austerity was there, there's no question 
about that. Deferred maintenance on buildings

08:32.331 --> 08:34.333
too. which they still, it's even worse now because 
they've deferred it, deferred it, deferred it.

08:40.053 --> 08:53.172
You were in Germany during the Russians' building 
of the Berlin Wall and also during the time that

08:40.053 --> 08:53.172
President Kennedy came to Germany and Berlin and 
made his famous speech that I am a Berliner in 1961.

08:53.673 --> 08:55.295
Do you remember that? Yeah, I was the 7th Army 
Support Command. But by the way, my successor to

08:57.378 --> 09:01.063
the 18th Infantry, He took the 18th Infantry. That 
was the unit that went through, you know, to

09:04.329 --> 09:08.392
Berlin. This was a test. They didn't know whether 
it was going to be World War III or what it was

09:09.874 --> 09:20.924
because the Germans had blockaded Berlin, you 
know, and had stopped traffic on the Autobahn

09:09.874 --> 09:20.924
going to Berlin. They did let the trains run, 
continue to run. So the 18th Infantry went. to

09:30.490 --> 09:45.586
Berlin who was welcomed by Vice President Johnson 
as

09:30.490 --> 09:45.586
he entered Berlin.

09:45.606 --> 09:49.990
But I had no involvement in any of that at all. OK. 
Now, on your next assignment as Deputy Chief of

09:50.811 --> 09:57.578
Staff, in Fort McPherson in the Third Army. Is this 
one when you were promoted to general? Yeah. Tell

10:07.483 --> 10:07.723
me. I was selected. I got my star. When you were 
selected. Okay, tell me how you found out that you

10:11.807 --> 10:16.972
were selected. Well, this is a...

10:25.621 --> 10:26.502
I had a friend named Chickalella

10:27.308 --> 10:34.499
that was over in Europe at the same time. He was a G3 
of the Corps. And Chickalella, he's a big

10:38.344 --> 10:40.848
operator. He finally got promoted to major 
general.

10:45.855 --> 10:48.839
And I think he'd been promoted to brigadier 
general. But I was at Fort McClellan, and old

10:48.860 --> 10:51.924
Chickalella gave me a call. He said, say, I just saw 
the list of officers that haven't been published

10:56.620 --> 10:59.244
yet. But I saw the list that the board has 
submitted. And I'm sure it's routine that they

11:03.910 --> 11:16.868
approve, although Chief of Staff hadn't been 
known to line out one officer one time because of a

11:03.910 --> 11:16.868
physical problem that he knew about that 
apparently nobody else knew about. But he said,

11:19.332 --> 11:20.653
you're on the list. Of course, I was really elated 
then because that's a great Of course, I didn't

11:26.523 --> 11:29.006
tell anybody, but I had more sense than that. 
That's just like talking about a no-hitter in a

11:29.026 --> 11:33.012
game. You put the hoax on it. So time went on, and 
finally the list came out. In the last little act,

11:41.463 --> 11:43.966
my name wasn't on it. It was not? Yeah. So I thought, 
gee, maybe old Chickalella was mistaken, or maybe

11:45.428 --> 11:54.320
for some reason my name was taken off.

11:54.340 --> 11:56.142
Because the chief of staff, can recommend you know 
it's approved by the president sure and the

11:57.033 --> 12:23.462
president could very well you could recommend 
that you could eliminate somebody or maybe

11:57.033 --> 12:23.462
something had been added the president has been 
known to add names on the list not somebody else not

11:57.033 --> 12:23.462
lately done though because you know they accept 
because after all that you're going to have a lot of

11:57.033 --> 12:23.462
screenings and so i really sweated that out see i 
guess Sometimes they carry over to the next year,

12:24.168 --> 12:31.336
but usually they don't because they throw it back 
in and you all do it again in the next committee.

12:31.676 --> 12:34.219
Because each year you've got new people becoming 
eligible. And you have others that are dropping

12:34.319 --> 12:40.746
off because of the age of them. But fortunately, 
that year they had split it into two different

12:40.766 --> 12:43.990
parts. And long in the fall, here comes out the new 
list with me right at the head of the list.

12:54.779 --> 12:57.181
Chickalilla was right. I celebrate it. But the 
deputy chief of staff job there is, of course, just

12:59.223 --> 13:11.834
as the name implies, you assist the chief of staff 
of the Army in the paperwork.

13:16.338 --> 13:20.462
What was the size of the Third Army and the 
responsibilities? Boy, see, it included the...

13:25.238 --> 13:38.670
It included 101st Airborne, 82nd, 18th Airborne 
Corps, all of the schools were bidding in on the

13:25.238 --> 13:38.670
troops. All of the troops and facilities in the 
area

13:38.690 --> 13:51.622
were headquartered in Atlanta all down south. The 
First Army went north up in the And

13:55.563 --> 14:05.696
so it was a lot of activity, a lot of paperwork, a lot 
of budget problems, maintenance problems.

14:05.716 --> 14:06.578
Sounds like a desk job. Oh, yeah. Did you like this 
job as much as you liked being in Germany

14:09.401 --> 14:15.209
commanding the battle group? Oh, no. No job 
compared to that battle group. Do you think that

14:19.895 --> 14:24.321
the battle group job was what you consider the 
highlight of your career?

14:27.980 --> 14:36.970
Well, my battalion in World War II, I think the 3rd 
Battalion, because I was with it for quite some

14:27.980 --> 14:36.970
time in a lot of different situations.

14:40.354 --> 14:41.175
Those two jobs? I'd say the 18th was more of a joy 
because this other was a...

14:41.195 --> 14:55.371
You talk about responsibility, you get 
responsibility for an infantry battalion in

14:41.195 --> 14:55.371
combat. where you can really, that's when a 
decision or judgment can, you're taking lives or

14:57.292 --> 15:09.128
losing lives, or it can be successful. And that 
hurts you. You get close to those people, it's like

15:10.950 --> 15:17.078
losing a member of your family. Fortunately, when 
you get replacements, you don't know every

15:17.098 --> 15:26.691
soldier personally, but

15:17.098 --> 15:26.691
it's still a, You know that every one of those wife, 
in some cases, mother, father, you know, the whole

15:27.818 --> 15:33.964
family. So when you see that mutilated body, that 
really shouldn't stay with the unit in combat too

15:34.464 --> 15:43.814
long because there is such a thing as battle to 
take. Fortunately, I never did get it. I almost got

15:46.676 --> 15:55.805
it one time because in San Pietro in Italy, we were 
attacking and I was in a depression. Of course, I

15:55.925 --> 15:57.707
got there because that what little

15:58.058 --> 16:02.883
shelter we had was it. And I was there, and I called 
in a hunch. Something said, get up and move. So I

16:09.510 --> 16:10.831
just got up and moved over. And the artillery 
liaison officer came up, and he got in the same

16:10.851 --> 16:16.177
position. He just got there in a mortar round, hit 
him in the back. He was on his stomach. And of

16:20.361 --> 16:22.684
course, cut him in two. And while the two separate 
parts of his body, his head looked up and looked

16:22.744 --> 16:26.968
right at me. And he said something like, I'm here 
that they got me, or something like that. Then you

16:32.970 --> 16:36.314
start worrying or thinking about, am I having a 
hunch? You know, you're inseparable. And of

16:38.436 --> 16:39.697
course you're not. I don't know what to call that, 
fate, or I don't know what it was. But you kind of

16:43.601 --> 16:45.984
feel, maybe I'm the one who should. If I stayed 
there, I'd say he was going somewhere else. So I can

16:49.407 --> 16:56.955
go through my life from the very beginning and how 
fortunate I have been in different situations. So

16:57.965 --> 17:01.509
that's what I come back to as far as my career. I've 
just been lucky. Just been lucky. Now, were you

17:05.114 --> 17:11.842
happy to go to Korea?

17:11.862 --> 17:12.904
Well, yes. Of course, I was so elated to be selected 
for General Officer, you know, I was ready to go,

17:15.167 --> 17:27.482
because now I'm starting out in a... And I had that 
nice tour in Germany, and of course... Vietnam War

17:28.154 --> 17:29.916
hadn't quite started. Now, our employment had. 
See, Kennedy

17:33.620 --> 17:41.209
was influenced, or he was a great supporter of the 
Green Berets. You know, their organization where

17:42.130 --> 17:45.675
they... Did you have anything to do with that? No. 
The nature of their organization, you know, they

17:46.435 --> 17:50.981
go in and they're teams and they organize. In other 
words, with a few highly skilled Americans, we can

17:51.401 --> 17:57.148
generate, you know, stability or... combat 
without getting it and if they can it's a very

17:57.466 --> 18:23.811
attractive and so Kennedy thought this is great 
then maybe we can accomplish what we want to in

17:57.466 --> 18:23.811
Vietnam without employing a lot of troops and but 
just when I got to to Korea and now my assignment was

17:57.466 --> 18:23.811
the assistant division commander for combat 
operations We were scheduled to have an

18:24.955 --> 18:33.028
amphibious operation, which I was given that 
responsibility as soon as I got there. So we made

18:33.048 --> 18:38.877
our plans, and we reconorded the area where we were 
going to do it. And we had the ships identified, of

18:39.297 --> 18:48.251
course, the Navy participation, and then the Gulf 
of Tonkin occurred. 1964. What were your feelings

18:49.493 --> 18:53.359
of the Gulf of Tonkin? Well, of course, that 
distance I didn't know about, but I learned a lot

18:53.575 --> 18:57.358
about it later. So

18:58.459 --> 19:03.864
the Navy, of course, was diverted in. Everything 
was towards the result of the Gulf of Tonkin. So

19:09.609 --> 19:12.091
that amphibious was called off. And so we 
continued to train. Then we had a Corps, two US

19:16.015 --> 19:19.377
divisions. Now it's reduced to one. And good 
training, because, see, you don't have any

19:23.427 --> 19:28.654
dependents. You don't have anywhere to go. So you 
train day and night. Well,

19:33.021 --> 19:37.447
you don't train every night. But you can 
concentrate, devote your full attention, which

19:37.948 --> 19:42.214
you couldn't do in Europe. See, they have their 
families, sick wives. Hi. How are you? Very good,

19:47.081 --> 19:49.083
ma'am. I decided on the omelet. Would you rather 
have coffee or tea? How long were you in Korea? A

19:55.743 --> 19:56.684
little over a year. The

19:58.546 --> 20:05.414
Korean people, I really liked them. Of course, I 
had known a little bit about Korea in the month that

20:05.975 --> 20:11.441
I was in during the war.

20:14.665 --> 20:15.847
But they were really friendly. They loved music, 
children, and flowers. They liked American

20:19.070 --> 20:21.193
stuff. What did you think about their ability? 
They tried to do everything that we do. Even they

20:26.364 --> 20:29.850
designed their military officers. They 
redesigned our black uniform and patterned our

20:29.870 --> 20:38.384
flight jackets.

20:38.404 --> 20:43.992
I learned, I think, that the women in Korea are 
second class, you know. The husband, that's

20:45.114 --> 20:46.937
wrong. Mama-son, she runs everything. in our 
maneuvering around, sometimes we have to cross

20:50.907 --> 20:56.414
their terrain. And you're wasting your time if you 
talk to Papa's son. If you want to get something

21:01.181 --> 21:03.864
done, you can talk to Mama's son. If he says yes and 
she hadn't said yes, you're in trouble, you know,

21:04.886 --> 21:09.532
couldn't you? So, like so many cultures in the 
world, they make you think or let the males think

21:09.552 --> 21:19.986
they're running things, but really they don't. 
They let them talk big, smoke the pipe. How did the

21:24.476 --> 21:29.964
troops get along with the Korean civilians?

21:30.024 --> 21:30.885
Real well. What did you think of the fighting 
ability of their army? Korean? Real fighting.

21:49.345 --> 21:50.787
They're fierce fighters. They're near what the 
Gurkhas were.

21:56.614 --> 22:05.684
Because the Gurkhas, you know, they, we were 
talking back in Italy, I'm going way back then,

21:56.614 --> 22:05.684
they were great knife fighters. And they were near 
us, and it wasn't unusual at all to have them to feel

22:05.704 --> 22:14.334
at night the neck. They're looking to see if you had 
dog tags. If you had dog tags, then you were

22:17.645 --> 22:19.568
American. But whoa, be you if you didn't have your 
dog tags on, because that'd cut your throat or cut

22:19.948 --> 22:25.095
off your ears. Bring ears back to prove that the 
bodies, I don't mean the Koreans were that brutal

22:26.297 --> 22:35.851
and more civilized, I guess. But they did a 
tremendous job, and Vietnam's a good example. In

22:42.099 --> 22:44.783
fact, the Vietnamese soon learned to leave them 
alone They'd probe and try to find where the

22:45.100 --> 22:50.346
Americans were rather than get mixes with those 
Koreans. Of course, the Koreans

22:50.366 --> 22:54.371
were... I mentioned the Gurkhas. The Koreans are 
kind of brutal. I mean, they don't show any mercy

22:57.355 --> 23:00.058
either. But in Korea, we had, you know, in our 
divisions there, we had Koreans in our American

23:02.501 --> 23:10.551
divisions. Each company had a couple, or a few 
Koreans. Oh, quite a few, 15 to 20. It was called the

23:19.869 --> 23:25.278
Korean augmentation. And that presented sort of a 
problem, because Americans, of course, got paid a

23:27.121 --> 23:32.951
lot more. Sure. And the Koreans had the same 
equipment. But if somebody stole something from a

23:35.616 --> 23:38.901
Korean, you know, like a mess kit or something like 
that. He really had a problem. Plus, he didn't have

23:43.379 --> 23:46.583
money to spend in the PX. Later, we had a Katusa PX, 
which they would rather have anyway because they

23:47.824 --> 23:55.372
don't particularly like the same thing Americans 
do. Right. And they don't particularly like our

23:57.314 --> 24:01.319
food either because Koreans like kimchi. You ever 
eat kimchi? I know it's down to here. H-E-B, they

24:05.884 --> 24:07.926
sell it in the store. What is it? It's cabbage and 
fish and garlic and they mix it all together and

24:08.943 --> 24:18.754
they put it in a great big stone jar and bury it in the 
ground. And I'm telling you, for wintertime. Do it

24:21.016 --> 24:24.760
in summer, of course, when they're harvesting all 
this stuff. Oh, it's terrible. You think

24:27.604 --> 24:29.165
somebody's been eating garlic. It's about the 
only way to get that rotten fish and garlic and all

24:30.086 --> 24:34.772
this other thing. But they love that. In fact, I had 
a I was up near the DMZ. I wasn't at the division

24:39.871 --> 24:41.294
headquarters. I was at the DMZ at a real nice 
general's mess. The brigade commander was there,

24:46.682 --> 24:55.797
and several of the units were up there. And we had a 
mess. We had waiters, Korean waiters that we paid.

25:06.091 --> 25:09.135
And they'd come in in the wintertime to serve. And 
his accent was so strong, you'd pick up a piece of

25:09.155 --> 25:17.064
bread and it even tastes like that odor, you know. 
So we finally got these characters. We said,

25:18.446 --> 25:19.867
please, this is our mess. We're paying you. Please 
don't eat kimchi. Well, yes, sir. We agreed.

25:28.037 --> 25:33.263
They'd go for about two or three days, and then they 
couldn't resist coming back again.

25:34.913 --> 25:54.973
Recently, in the last couple of years, President 
Carter was considering decreasing the number of

25:34.913 --> 25:54.973
troops in Korea, and there was a lot of statements 
that that would weaken our posture, and we

25:34.913 --> 25:54.973
shouldn't do it, and we should maintain our 
50-some thousand troops that we have in Korea.

25:55.013 --> 25:55.814
What's your opinion? Should we have that many 
troops there, or do you think that we should bring

25:56.194 --> 26:02.841
some home? What do you think? Well,

26:04.310 --> 26:27.473
of course, I think it should have stayed just like 
it was when we were there

26:04.310 --> 26:27.473
for stability and also to protect nuclear weapons 
that we might have or might in the future have, that

26:04.310 --> 26:27.473
sort of thing.

26:31.838 --> 26:34.080
We control the Koreans. I should say we didn't 
exactly control them. We might have tried to. But

26:38.337 --> 26:47.890
we had a stabilizing effect on keeping the South 
Koreans from attacking the North Koreans.

26:47.910 --> 26:56.121
Because when they got strong and got the equipment 
and so forth, they wanted to go unify their

26:47.910 --> 26:56.121
country. And of course, the North Koreans feel the 
same way, at least Kim, the commander. And it's

27:02.697 --> 27:05.280
good training if you're going to maintain the 
division. Now, you're going to say, now, I know

27:05.580 --> 27:08.884
what you're doing. That shows you have a military 
man in the unit. We know that if we move back a

27:12.548 --> 27:19.196
division to the United States, the chances are 
that it's going to be deactivated. You're just

27:19.216 --> 27:22.700
going to have one less division. We need that 
division. Japan's not strong.

27:29.326 --> 27:34.655
And it's good because MacArthur's Constitution, 
they can only have a defense force, and they say we

27:29.326 --> 27:34.655
have a defense force. We can't use anything 
offensively. Actually, they really don't have

27:39.123 --> 27:42.268
sufficient strength for a defense force. And 
they're very, Korea's very important to them.

27:50.281 --> 27:51.423
And they're not going to do it. In fact, A few years 
ago, we would be horrified if we even thought that

27:53.018 --> 28:02.973
they were going to move something there, because 
they see expansion, there they go again,

27:53.018 --> 28:02.973
imperialistic.

28:02.993 --> 28:06.399
And it's good training, and to have the forces 
there. And it's stabilized. Now the main thing,

28:11.026 --> 28:21.642
though, Carter, as far as I'm concerned, was a 
disaster from the word go, although I wanted a

28:11.026 --> 28:21.642
southerner to be successful, see. But it was a 
disaster. So many things he did. If he had

28:26.662 --> 28:36.973
negotiated, used that as a negotiating, you know, 
with the North Koreans, for example, or to use it

28:26.662 --> 28:36.973
somewhere as a chip for negotiating. But he just 
unilaterally said, I'm going to take these out.

28:41.157 --> 28:42.258
Same thing with the B-1. If you'd use that as a 
negotiating to reduce, or the neutron weapon, for

28:43.500 --> 28:50.667
example. Unilaterally, after convincing the 
Germans finally to accept that as a very fine

28:51.524 --> 29:02.857
weapon for defense without decimating their 
country, see? Unilaterally, Smith read about it

29:04.098 --> 29:07.161
in the paper. After he had gone to the people and 
stuck his neck out, which was unpopular, and now

29:08.783 --> 29:19.455
it's really unpopular now, with

29:08.783 --> 29:19.455
the Germans, particularly the German youth, I'm 
not the neutron, but any kind of weapon now, even

29:20.549 --> 29:28.278
updating what we already have in missile.

29:28.298 --> 29:29.920
So I thought it was a mistake then. I don't say we 
shouldn't take them out someday. But see, I lived

29:34.445 --> 29:36.247
through the other.

29:41.694 --> 29:47.080
When the Secretary of State announced to the world 
that our security line It was Japan, Taiwan,

29:47.785 --> 29:54.395
Philippines, Okinawa, and on around. Eliminated 
Korea. And then what happened? And if you said

29:59.662 --> 30:03.067
that, then we phased out our troops. Now, North 
Koreans look and said, well, they invited us. They

30:07.194 --> 30:12.862
said, this isn't vital to the security of the 
United States. So now's the time to move in. So they

30:15.781 --> 30:17.263
attacked, and what happened? Harry Truman 
managed to declare not an emergency, not a war, but

30:17.323 --> 30:27.634
a police action. And then we found we were in a 
full-blown war with no troops prepared, no

30:27.654 --> 30:34.602
equipment. The units we had in Japan at that time 
not only were understrength and under-equipped,

30:34.622 --> 30:40.789
they weren't even... Some had a phantom, a ghost, 
regiment because division had two regiments

30:46.409 --> 30:52.981
under strength. Air Force wasn't ready at all. 
Neither was the Navy. And all at once we found that

30:58.651 --> 31:01.216
we were in a war. And so we know what happened. We put 
in and we were in a battle and finally got kicked

31:02.638 --> 31:07.607
around all the way down to the perimeter. and 
fought back with all those casualties. Of course,

31:11.099 --> 31:15.603
those casualties didn't seem so large now since we 
had Vietnam all these years. That's another

31:15.623 --> 31:16.524
question. When you were in Korea, did the Gulf of 
Tonkin and then the subsequent buildup in Vietnam

31:16.724 --> 31:29.716
have any impact on your maneuvers, your training, 
your efficiency in Korea? Because there, just

31:30.517 --> 31:35.822
like in Germany, we're supposed to be combat ready 
to fight. It can't even be an alert there because

31:37.220 --> 31:44.729
the DMZ, where we were sitting, we were up to see the 
DMZ. And we had troops actually on the DMZ. 1st

31:47.472 --> 31:51.156
Cavalry Division had troops on the DMZ. We don't 
any longer. We go back where we don't man. And the

31:55.562 --> 32:00.808
Koreans manned on the DMZ since we lost one 
division.

32:02.370 --> 32:02.670
No. We were always on alert, see, and we had 
practice alert, just like we had in Europe. It was

32:10.778 --> 32:19.046
easier there because we didn't have people out 
living with their families in apartments, you

32:10.778 --> 32:19.046
know, 15, 20 miles away. All you had to do was wake 
the people up and get in the vehicles and move to

32:19.066 --> 32:24.310
dispersal area. After that, from 65 to 68, you had 
a, to me, it looks like a very important job in the

32:25.672 --> 32:31.717
Pentagon. Oh, yeah. That

32:34.257 --> 32:43.866
was in the National Military Command Center. As 
Deputy Director of Operations and later Chief of

32:43.886 --> 32:49.571
Far Eastern Division Plans and Policy. Yeah. All 
in the Joint Staff. Thinking about a pressure job

32:52.153 --> 32:55.917
now. That National Military Command Center. 
Because you're actually the duty officer of the

32:58.339 --> 33:01.902
world. and certainly the duty officer of the 
United States, because all of the elements of

33:03.198 --> 33:18.672
government look to this military command post to 
answer questions, because we have the facility to

33:03.198 --> 33:18.672
do that. What happens anywhere in the world? So 
basically what you're doing in the National

33:21.855 --> 33:25.759
Military Command Center is information? Command 
and control of all the armed forces. U.S. and

33:32.155 --> 33:34.318
deployed overseas.

33:37.783 --> 33:44.732
And I'll describe, it's in the Pentagon, in the 
Joint Staff's area. And of course you have to have

33:46.274 --> 33:49.999
special clearance and a special path to get in. 
Because then you don't have this, or sometimes you

33:50.941 --> 34:01.555
have VIPs that they take in, and the Goldwater and a 
few like that come in. But you have a brigadier

34:02.311 --> 34:09.902
general or a flag officer on duty 24 hours a day. 
And, of course, we have Air Force Navy admins in the

34:11.344 --> 34:14.889
Army. And you have an assistant that sits there 
with you. I say sit because it's a big room, almost

34:22.360 --> 34:29.611
as big as a football field, but not quite. It's 
almost an issue. configured almost like that. And

34:34.826 --> 34:37.811
we're up here with all of our telephones. And out on 
the floor, you have representatives of the CIA,

34:39.634 --> 34:56.240
the State Department, Defense Intelligence, 
USIA, and area specialists, which could be manned

34:39.634 --> 34:56.240
by Army, Navy, Air Force. It doesn't make any 
difference. So that every part of the world, you

34:58.370 --> 35:10.921
have an individual who is monitoring on an 
hour-to-hour basis, day-to-day, what the

34:58.370 --> 35:10.921
situation is there, what we have. In the case of the 
Navy, they can answer where all of the ships are.

35:16.526 --> 35:18.628
They monitor all of the ships worldwide. The 
Persian government, any time, they can tell you

35:19.409 --> 35:26.535
what it is.

35:26.555 --> 35:28.377
I'm sorry to interrupt, but I'm starting to... 
Shall we continue? Yeah, one thing

35:28.559 --> 35:42.339
that I failed to say about Korea that had an effect 
on my career was that I had developed a back

35:28.559 --> 35:42.339
problem, a herniated disc. I don't know what 
caused it. It just happened. Spinal disc? Yeah.

35:45.965 --> 35:50.131
And so I spent considerable time, about three 
weeks, in the hospital. And it results with that

35:51.894 --> 35:56.220
physical problem. In Korea? You were in the 
hospital in Korea? Yeah. If I was in the States, I'd

36:01.391 --> 36:11.827
probably go to Walton Reed where they had the 
surgery, but I wanted to finish my tour in Korea

36:01.391 --> 36:11.827
because this happened halfway through the tour. 
So I continued on, but I had to get out of the

36:13.590 --> 36:25.228
hospital, but not up to really the efficiency you 
expect someone to do. And there's no question that

36:25.529 --> 36:37.247
affected my career from then on because I always 
had this problem that you lift anything or run,

36:25.529 --> 36:37.247
pain comes back, still does. Of course, I've 
learned now there's no reason for exertion. Well,

36:42.234 --> 36:46.781
John, we'll get back to the military command 
center. And you were telling me about the

36:46.801 --> 36:50.507
functions and duties there. Right. If you 
visualize all of these people and with their

36:51.671 --> 37:19.043
knowledge and their accessibility to, because 
they themselves continually got updated, I don't

36:51.671 --> 37:19.043
mean every second, but they were sure that from 
their sources, and the Army has an operations

36:51.671 --> 37:19.043
center, the Navy does, and the Air Force, but this 
was, and we were all tied into them, so we were fed

36:51.671 --> 37:19.043
information from everyone. The key part, 
however, to the facility was the communication we

37:20.120 --> 37:26.629
had. And it was off to the side. And we could speak 
directly to any command element in the world where

37:30.855 --> 37:45.455
we had U.S. And each day we would test that command. 
We'd actually come home with a conference call,

37:45.515 --> 37:49.941
the flag officer. would go in in the communication 
because the outside was local communications

37:50.883 --> 37:56.289
type of thing. But this was the

37:56.369 --> 38:01.556
powerful communication. And they didn't even, 
communication even had a capability. If you had a

38:04.739 --> 38:09.465
weak signal, they could raise the volume on that 
signal. Would it be by satellite? Yeah, they used

38:12.268 --> 38:15.672
satellite, the whole range of communication. And 
we also have an airborne command post, and a Navy

38:21.832 --> 38:28.180
command post. So we would bring them in this 
community check, communication check with the

38:29.021 --> 38:33.847
others.

38:37.511 --> 38:38.693
We'd go to use the . I'll say every place that we had a 
command. I don't mean down a lower level, but we had

38:42.217 --> 38:45.121
the capability of doing that. For example, we had a

38:52.308 --> 39:05.648
The bomb says, let's see, we had

38:52.308 --> 39:05.648
a month or two which there was no bombing in North 
Vietnam. But the situation was such that the

39:08.151 --> 39:12.838
decision had been made to resume bombing.

39:17.085 --> 39:20.830
Secretary of State called, I happened to be on 
duty, And he says, this is very important. I want to

39:24.721 --> 39:32.450
know when the first bomb drops in the resumption of 
bombing in North Vietnam. Now, he pointed out this

39:33.291 --> 39:39.117
is important because we have pre-positioned 
messages at all of our embassies in the world. And I

39:40.638 --> 39:48.006
don't want to prematurely release this for 
weather conditions or reason, you know, that we

39:40.638 --> 39:48.006
really can't execute the mission. Can you let me 
know immediately? And I said, yes, sir. So all we

39:52.512 --> 40:01.940
did was go through the sink back with this powerful 
communication, went on into the carriers were

39:52.512 --> 40:01.940
going to make the first strike. To them, I talked to 
the, it wasn't a captain, it was an officer on, I

40:02.621 --> 40:19.656
guess a man in their community, their duty officer 
on the carrier, and explained what our situation

40:02.621 --> 40:19.656
was and can you let me know when the first bomb is 
dropped. No abortion or anything like that the

40:25.892 --> 40:27.874
first time. He said, absolutely. He says, I'll 
patch in right now to the flight commander. And you

40:35.842 --> 40:40.527
will hear him tell me when he has dropped, when the 
bomb's away. So here I am monitoring with the clock

40:42.069 --> 40:44.631
ticking along. So pretty soon you heard. Of 
course, I was a little bit weaker because he was

40:46.033 --> 40:49.356
coming from the radio. And he says, bombs away. So 
immediately it called up the State Department. It

40:54.769 --> 40:59.036
was just a matter of, well, almost 
simultaneously. We had in Washington the word.

41:01.601 --> 41:04.445
Now you don't like to do that because you tie up a lot 
of communication. You like to deal only with the

41:04.986 --> 41:08.532
headquarters rather than go on down. But you just 
heard the fighter pilot just say, bombs away.

41:13.340 --> 41:14.382
Yeah, he gave a... The word, it might have been 
other words at that time, but anyway, whatever he

41:15.138 --> 41:21.426
said, the indication. Right at that second, you 
got on the phone and called the State Department.

41:24.830 --> 41:25.331
Yeah, exactly. So the Secretary of State knew 
about that almost simultaneously, just a few

41:25.351 --> 41:32.980
minutes. That's just an example of the 
communication, how it worked. That's fantastic.

41:36.324 --> 41:37.966
Now, you get involved with a lot of things.

41:40.870 --> 41:44.014
On the desk of the flag officer is a red telephone. 
That's directly to the president from the White

41:45.513 --> 41:48.837
House. And whenever that red light comes on, 
flashes, it actually flashes. Of course, you also

41:56.046 --> 41:57.788
hear a signal. When you pick that up, there's no 
secretary on there. It's the president himself.

42:03.675 --> 42:04.656
And usually he calls. This was LBJ. He'd call about 
2 or 3 o'clock in the morning. Some said perhaps he

42:11.144 --> 42:14.828
had a bladder problem, but he slept very little. 
And he had, he monitored all of television, CBS,

42:15.854 --> 42:26.625
NBC, all of them at the same time, plus radio. And if 
a news flash came over about a strike

42:26.645 --> 42:42.520
in Vietnam, say they had heavy casualties, 
several planes were lost, these are just news

42:26.645 --> 42:42.520
reports, he'd be on that line asking He wanted an 
update, because I just heard that. Can you tell me

42:45.261 --> 42:47.863
about it? Well, while you're talking, of course, 
we have all the information we have that my

42:47.883 --> 43:00.357
assistant, who's also, he's on the line, and he 
signals the individual whose area we're talking

42:47.883 --> 43:00.357
about. Of course, it's always Vietnam. So he ran up 
with a map, put it up in front, and he was handing

43:02.299 --> 43:10.768
information while we were talking to the 
president, trying to answer his questions. Of

43:11.339 --> 43:17.786
course, oftentimes we didn't have it, so we just 
had to tell you, well, Mr. President, we don't have

43:11.339 --> 43:17.786
an update on that. I'll notify your situation room 
just as soon as we have it. And he said, all right,

43:23.171 --> 43:25.133
thank you. White House has a situation room, too, 
where they monitor these things. And often he

43:32.020 --> 43:37.566
called them, but he finally got word that they 
didn't know because they'd have to get the

43:32.020 --> 43:37.566
information from us. So they, too, were always 
asking us, please update us on this, because they

43:38.423 --> 43:43.710
anticipated he might come. His son-in-law was up 
near Khe Sanh.

43:52.200 --> 43:54.703
And he was very anxious about a situation up there. 
He didn't say, I don't wonder if my son-in-law was

43:54.803 --> 43:56.846
there. Obviously, what was happening? I 
shouldn't even say that, because he was

43:58.888 --> 44:01.592
interested in every single thing. It really hurt 
him to have a report that a pilot had been lost. It

44:06.798 --> 44:08.120
really hurt LBJ. Yeah. He wanted to say any chance 
to find that pilot. Of course, you can't answer

44:13.516 --> 44:15.418
that, I mean, here. And you don't go back like I've 
said and try to find out the unit. Sure. But it's a

44:20.925 --> 44:22.407
normal routine.

44:25.831 --> 44:32.319
But when his son-in-law was over in Vietnam, he was 
on the phone more often asking about the area? No,

44:32.340 --> 44:33.881
he seemed to call now. While I was on duty, I guess he 
called me four times. And I guess the other flag

44:39.308 --> 44:42.993
also on duty, probably about the same area. That's 
over a period of a year that I was there. So he didn't

44:45.075 --> 44:46.357
call every night. But it was always, the call was 
generated by something that he had just seen or

44:46.938 --> 44:56.330
heard on the radio or television, particularly at 
night. And some said it wasn't a bladder problem,

44:57.091 --> 45:01.276
but he just couldn't sleep. Didn't only need two or 
three hours of sleep. And he wanted to talk to

45:05.762 --> 45:07.324
somebody. Sometimes in the daytime, they'd say, 
get me that general on the phone. And they meant

45:13.377 --> 45:17.824
that general in the National Military Command 
Center. But he sure took a personal interest and

45:17.844 --> 45:22.752
suffered with all those guys, so they can't. Of 
course, he was under great pressure to recall, you

45:22.772 --> 45:29.382
know, yelling at him, LBJ, how many did you kill 
today? Another example of a domestic problem that

45:29.402 --> 45:34.290
we were confronted with I don't know whether you 
remember or not, but we had this massive blackout

45:35.384 --> 45:40.991
in the northeastern part of the United States. Do 
you remember that? No. And

45:43.874 --> 45:56.109
so I got a call from, it wasn't the governor of New 
York, because apparently he wasn't there. I guess

45:56.509 --> 45:59.373
he was Rockefeller at the time, but the lieutenant 
governor. And I forget his name. It was an Italian

46:01.015 --> 46:03.838
name. He says, uh, everybody thought, you know, 
eventually, or momentarily, they'd get this

46:04.797 --> 46:10.346
corrected. But what bothered, for example, the 
Lieutenant Governor, it wasn't just a blackout in

46:10.366 --> 46:27.193
New York City, it went all the way upstate and in 
Connecticut and all the way, of course, because it

46:10.366 --> 46:27.193
eventually found out it was in the Niagara Falls 
areas where the problem was. But he was asking for

46:28.912 --> 46:30.053
help. He said, we need New York City particularly. 
Is there something that could be done? And he had

46:36.379 --> 46:40.422
already called, apparently, Secretary 
McNamara. McNamara called me a few minutes later

46:42.304 --> 46:50.131
and said, say, these people in New York City need 
some help. And I said, yes. I just had a call from the

46:52.453 --> 46:57.577
lieutenant governor asking for help. And he says, 
uh. What about the ships in New York Harbor? Why

47:03.508 --> 47:06.272
can't they generate electricity? One of the 
problems is they didn't have electricity in New

47:07.575 --> 47:17.552
York City to start their auxiliary generator, the 
power to start the auxiliary generator. That's

47:17.812 --> 47:22.240
really one of the problems.
