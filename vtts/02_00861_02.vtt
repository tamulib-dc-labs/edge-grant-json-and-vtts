00:01.448 --> 00:13.143
tape ran out, we were struggling with the problem 
of why Rockdale's lignite mine situation was

00:01.448 --> 00:13.143
apparently more progressive than a company town 
situation like Pullman. Well, you know, a whole

00:14.104 --> 00:25.299
lot of that I think can be attributed to the class of 
businessmen and civic leaders that Rockdale had.

00:25.359 --> 00:28.082
People like H.C. Meyer and E.B. Phillips and Bruce 
Denton, N.M. Bullock, and my father, the

00:29.377 --> 00:48.634
newspaper man, John Esten Cook, and they thought a 
lot of Rockdale, and

00:29.377 --> 00:48.634
they looked upon the mines out there, they were 
proud of the mines out there, but the The Mexicans

00:49.863 --> 00:58.775
that worked out there in the mines had their own 
little community, and they kind of took care of

00:49.863 --> 00:58.775
their own affairs and celebrated this thing 
called the mail. And they didn't bother anybody,

00:58.795 --> 01:03.161
and we didn't bother them. I think it was more of a 
peaceful coexistence. Right. I've been amazed.

01:11.152 --> 01:15.178
No one particularly thought about them being 
outsiders out there working, you know. I've been

01:16.880 --> 01:24.328
amazed at the lack of labor troubles out there. 
They weren't labor troubles, but labor troubles

01:24.348 --> 01:27.451
came along. Years later after everybody got 
educated by the union. They weren't labor

01:34.979 --> 01:46.431
troubles and there wasn't ethnic

01:47.542 --> 01:55.710
There wasn't so much thought given to ethnic 
groups and problems that might arise from them.

01:55.830 --> 02:02.296
They were just looked upon as part of the 
community. Do you think that just the physical

02:04.018 --> 02:17.110
nature of Word of Mind were kind of... That bound to 
have had a whole lot to do with it, because they

02:04.018 --> 02:17.110
were, you know, out there anywhere five, six, 
seven miles from the center of town. And they just

02:18.541 --> 02:22.426
sort of appeared like the farmers coming in on one 
case. Right. To the rest of the people around me.

02:24.148 --> 02:24.589
That's right. Well, again, I want to thank you, and 
I hope you didn't. I think on some of those, on some

02:29.015 --> 02:40.990
of those Mexican celebrations, I, you know, I 
don't remember them because that was, I was too

02:29.015 --> 02:40.990
young to participate in that sort of thing then. 
But I think there were a lot of Rockdale people that

02:41.651 --> 02:44.835
used to like to go out there. and participate in 
some of them, make them celebrations. You know,

02:49.280 --> 02:54.308
welcome them and help them celebrate. There just 
wasn't that much of a mention in the paper about

02:55.089 --> 02:59.035
that. Probably not. And another thing you might 
keep in mind is newspapers in those days were a

03:00.998 --> 03:08.689
pretty far cry from newspapers today. Oh, yes. And 
the...

03:18.616 --> 03:20.959
That wasn't the big news stories in those days. The 
big news stories were strictly local and Mr. and

03:21.039 --> 03:30.210
Mrs. John Henry visiting somebody else and all of 
that sort of thing. So-and-so bought such and such

03:30.370 --> 03:33.834
piece of land. And even advertising was different 
in those days. Mostly, most good civic-minded

03:36.457 --> 03:46.108
businessmen thought they should advertise to 
support the paper because the town needed the

03:46.358 --> 03:49.242
paper. And today, they advertise to get business, 
and I don't think that was so much the case then. It

03:57.051 --> 04:01.156
was goodwill advertising in those days, you know. 
Well, I did notice a big jump after 1936 in the

04:01.176 --> 04:06.983
number of advertisements in the paper. I don't 
know if that was due to your solicitations or not,

04:07.003 --> 04:11.709
but it was just amazing to me. There was a jump. 
Well, I think you'll find that true all over the

04:15.248 --> 04:18.172
state. Weekly newspapers have changed a lot and 
have become more news-conscious and more

04:18.833 --> 04:34.394
advertising-conscious, and businessmen have 
done the same thing. Well, again, thank you, and I

04:36.957 --> 04:40.943
appreciate it very much. You're sure welcome. 
Good luck to you.
