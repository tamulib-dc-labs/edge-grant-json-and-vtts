00:01.297 --> 00:02.058
How are you doing? Today is November the 16th. And I 
am visiting with Dr. Phil Limbacher, professor

00:06.443 --> 00:12.389
emeritus of educational curriculum and 
instruction. And he was appointed to Texas A&M in

00:13.310 --> 00:17.795
1969. And we're going to talk about his 
perceptions of the College of Education since its

00:18.996 --> 00:28.127
inception, which happens to be in 1969, the same 
year that you started. And I would like to know, a

00:31.081 --> 00:38.673
little bit about how you perceived the changes 
during the time that you were involved with the

00:31.081 --> 00:38.673
college. I

00:39.114 --> 00:51.374
came to the college, as you indicated earlier, the 
very first day that it was an official college, a

00:39.114 --> 00:51.374
separate college of education. And I never 
regretted it. I came to it from the College of

00:54.048 --> 00:57.473
Education at the University of Illinois. And my 
first perceptions and the reason I was drawn to it

00:57.733 --> 01:09.731
was the, I guess for want of anything better, the 
collegial atmosphere you had. Without

01:11.634 --> 01:22.570
denigrating the University of Illinois, it was 
more of a dog-eat-dog kind of society. faculty

01:22.921 --> 01:49.165
carved out a small domain of the discipline and 
felt that it was theirs and theirs only to mine and

01:22.921 --> 01:49.165
if anybody moved into it there was a great deal of 
cat-and-dog fighting and I did not see that down

01:22.921 --> 01:49.165
here and

01:22.921 --> 01:49.165
I hope that the college avoids that type of 
attitude as we move along. That was my first

01:52.302 --> 01:59.288
revealing change between the two colleges.

02:03.292 --> 02:19.506
Just as an aside, one of the things that was amusing 
to me,

02:03.292 --> 02:19.506
the observation of Labor Day at Champaign-Urbana 
was a holiday. the observation of Labor Day at

02:19.790 --> 02:25.135
Texas A&M was a duty day. And I recall very vividly 
the movers had moved and were moving all of our

02:25.616 --> 02:38.809
belongings into our newly purchased home in 
Bryan. And my wife was trying to handle the problem

02:39.590 --> 02:46.056
when I was at the university working. So I remember 
old Dean Hubert coming along at about that time and

02:48.865 --> 02:57.973
visiting with me and facetiously saying, what was 
I doing here? Why wasn't I somewhere else? Did Dean

03:00.155 --> 03:06.541
Hubert recruit you, or how did you happen to come to 
A&M? I had become less than enamored with the

03:08.242 --> 03:17.050
climate in Illinois, and my wife's home is down in 
the valley, and I spent a good deal of World War II

03:17.350 --> 03:27.205
fighting it here in the state, which was a very much 
nicer place to fight World War II than most. And I

03:27.225 --> 03:32.212
enjoyed the state and was hoping to retire from the 
military to it. And I had put in for positions.

03:40.083 --> 03:45.872
Texas A&M had advertised a position, and the 
University of Texas had advertised a position.

03:46.375 --> 03:56.154
And I can give you a little anecdote to show why I am 
very definitely opposed to Texas, the University

03:46.375 --> 03:56.154
of Texas. And it's also an indication of how far our 
society has gone. I made the applications and

04:01.364 --> 04:08.417
received a very short and terse letter from the 
University of Texas indicating that At this time,

04:09.190 --> 04:13.876
the university was not recruiting people of my age 
bracket. I was too old for the position. I don't

04:15.979 --> 04:16.440
know. I was 50-some-what, I guess, at the time. I 
came to this thing a little later than usual.

04:22.368 --> 04:38.590
University of Texas A&M, on the other hand, and the 
letter was signed by, I think, Glenn Johnson, who

04:22.368 --> 04:38.590
was the department head at the time, indicating 
that the position had been filled,

04:39.127 --> 04:41.010
He would keep my application on file. And the 
position I was looking for at that time was student

04:42.112 --> 04:47.381
teaching placement. And what little expertise I 
had was in the area of using videotapes.

04:55.055 --> 05:04.611
Micro-teaching, they called it at that time, 
which was a really useful way of breaking in a new

04:55.055 --> 05:04.611
teacher. And then I recall we were returning from 
the picnic on the 4th of July and the phone was

05:05.637 --> 05:15.888
ringing and Glenn was calling and wanted to know if 
I could come down. And I was very pleased to

05:16.488 --> 05:20.673
indicate I was able to come down. And we came down 
and I subsequently discovered that the reason the

05:21.494 --> 05:29.502
position was open, the occupant of a position I had 
gotten a little cross-purposes with the local

05:30.241 --> 05:35.349
public school officials. And evidently, the 
decision was made that perhaps that individual

05:35.369 --> 05:42.199
ought to seek other pastures. So that opened the 
position, and I was very, very pleased. And I came

05:45.364 --> 05:53.115
as an assistant professor, which was the position 
I held at the University of Illinois. Because as

05:53.135 --> 05:57.923
you know, I came out and retired in 67 from the 
military. I finished my degree. and then was

05:59.367 --> 06:02.550
teaching there at the university for a year. So 
that's why I was a little older than the average. An

06:06.695 --> 06:10.599
organization called SOTA, Students Older Than 
Average. Yes, I heard about that one. And that

06:12.181 --> 06:13.762
didn't go over too well down here. No, I heard about 
that too. I encountered that when I tried to get a

06:16.685 --> 06:26.095
dorm room, and they said they had one for SOTAs, you 
know, a floor, a special floor, and I kissed that.

06:26.115 --> 06:28.598
So I feel that category, so I know how you feel. 
Okay. Now I can dribble on like that, but I'm sure

06:30.041 --> 06:34.288
you've got another focus. Well, that was, you 
know, how you got here was one. And then once you

06:36.611 --> 06:45.684
were here and you began as an assistant professor, 
there were phenomenal changes between 1969 and

06:36.611 --> 06:45.684
the year you retired. You served in a lot of 
different positions. Can you just elaborate a

06:48.027 --> 06:52.514
little bit on some of the major changes and what you 
think brought them about? I know women was one of

06:52.614 --> 06:56.239
the big ones that everybody refers to, but. a 
little bit about administration, because you did

06:56.557 --> 07:05.208
work under two different administrators, and the 
changes that occurred as a result of that,

06:56.557 --> 07:05.208
possibly.

07:07.551 --> 07:17.965
The initial start of 69, as you would expect, we 
were still floundering around, and there were

07:07.551 --> 07:17.965
some organizational problems. But basically, in 
the The small area that I was interested in was in

07:23.725 --> 07:31.976
the secondary education, and they were divided as 
they are still now, secondary and elementary

07:23.725 --> 07:31.976
education.

07:34.460 --> 07:40.608
Major change at the start in the area that I was 
interested in, which is the student teaching

07:34.460 --> 07:40.608
aspects of it. When I first started in 69, the 
university

07:43.152 --> 07:51.083
was paying a very small stipend for the 
cooperating teacher, or supervisor of student

07:51.518 --> 07:57.146
teaching. And then I think Senate Bill 12, I'm not 
sure, but you can maybe check that out, which was a

07:57.948 --> 08:17.577
change in the entire student teaching aspects of 
it, where the state picked up and began pay the

08:17.810 --> 08:25.741
individual supervising teacher, cooperating 
teacher, whatever you will, the stipend, I think

08:17.810 --> 08:25.741
it was $200. And that was a major change. It 
subsequently got taken off again, didn't it? Yes,

08:33.232 --> 08:34.274
yes, yes. Because I know our district is one of the 
few that still pays it, but they just pay it. The

08:38.219 --> 08:40.523
district itself pays it. Yes, and that's 
unfortunate. I find the state putting their heavy

08:46.042 --> 08:54.254
hands in trying to operate a college of education 
in areas where they really do not belong, which is

08:46.042 --> 08:54.254
in the area of curriculum. But in the support area 
of student teaching support, it's unfortunate

08:54.274 --> 09:02.405
that they got out of it.

09:03.847 --> 09:11.037
That was probably one of the major changes, this 
shifting over from the university supporting it

09:03.847 --> 09:11.037
to the state supporting it. that of course 
enhanced the student teaching program, and we

09:11.573 --> 09:18.799
were able to make, I would say, good adjustments 
with the local public schools. I think the

09:25.442 --> 09:32.269
relationships we've had with both Bryan and 
College Station have always been good. Now, of

09:32.289 --> 09:41.438
course, we have moved out beyond it because of the 
volume we have, and we have established some

09:32.289 --> 09:41.438
excellent facilities, I understand, in Houston. 
I believe they're trying to host them in San

09:41.458 --> 09:44.961
Antonio. We already have 12 this semester. So 
we're moving across the state, which is where we

09:46.943 --> 09:51.149
belong. The other major change, and again, the 
state comes into the picture, because the state of

09:52.151 --> 10:13.221
Texas has had a history of attempting to control,

09:52.151 --> 10:13.221
I think is the best word I can use, the process of 
educating people to be teachers in the state of

10:13.437 --> 10:17.505
Texas. And Texas A&M has always been in the 
forefront in indicating that we are an agent of the

10:18.406 --> 10:31.210
state and one of our functions is to turn out 
students to become teachers. and that we are

10:32.303 --> 10:34.826
professionals. We have a better feel for what is 
needed than some legislature who is operating and

10:35.206 --> 10:43.675
being pushed by various groups. And that

10:44.716 --> 10:57.890
this position is one that should be held even to the 
point of, you might say, almost political

10:44.716 --> 10:57.890
confrontation with the state. And I speak in terms 
of the confrontation the then dean, Dean Hubert,

11:01.514 --> 11:19.956
and others had in the state when the state 
attempted to impose what they called

11:01.514 --> 11:19.956
competency-based teacher education or 
performance-based teacher education as the sole

11:01.514 --> 11:19.956
method of training teachers. This would have 
created consternation

11:19.976 --> 11:28.546
in their, and I'll use the term very clearly, in 
their ignorance. They felt that they could go into

11:31.619 --> 11:42.336
the humanities and tell the history teacher what 
his or her objectives were to be and how they were to

11:31.619 --> 11:42.336
achieve it. And of course this went over like a 
proverbial lead balloon.

11:48.567 --> 11:55.618
It eventually, and it was a long story and that's a 
beautiful one for a dissertation for somebody

11:48.567 --> 11:55.618
down the line, but eventually it was determined 
that the state was way off base in doing this and

11:56.003 --> 12:04.914
saying that was the only way it could be done. And 
that shackle was released from the colleges. And I

12:10.761 --> 12:25.538
think the college, Texas A&M University, took a 
strong stand in that position and should be

12:10.761 --> 12:25.538
congratulated

12:10.761 --> 12:25.538
for it. I understand that today we now are facing 
something similar to it, where the state is

12:26.108 --> 12:36.017
mandating the maximum number of hours and so on and 
so forth. And how this will come out, I really don't

12:36.037 --> 12:38.679
know. But I know this, as sure as I'm sitting right 
here, that the people that will be hurt are the

12:38.759 --> 12:50.269
students in the state of Texas down the line 15, 20 
years from now. We

12:50.349 --> 12:56.014
just . are two now, and what area are we working in 
specifically? Well, we're in changes that

13:00.731 --> 13:12.381
impacted the College of Education and what might 
have cost them in the external environment,

13:00.731 --> 13:12.381
societal changes, or like you said, the 
political. This was definitely all of the

13:12.441 --> 13:15.904
political influences that you're talking about. 
Philosophical, maybe there might have been some.

13:24.232 --> 13:24.752
What? I think the philosophical basis was that

13:25.306 --> 13:55.195
we took pride in the fact that there had been 
gathered what we considered to be a top flight

13:25.306 --> 13:55.195
faculty, and that

13:25.306 --> 13:55.195
we indicated very strongly that the faculty 
should be the ultimate decision makers as to the

13:25.306 --> 13:55.195
curriculum needed, and not some off-campus 
group. And fortunately, the administration

14:04.166 --> 14:07.831
supported us. I'm talking about the university 
administration supported the college in its

14:07.851 --> 14:12.920
approach. And we could not have done it, I don't 
believe, without the support of the university.

14:20.217 --> 14:27.584
At that time, as it is now, the mission of the 
college was still foremost, and it was the

14:20.217 --> 14:27.584
teaching, the research, and the service. In the 
two eras that you were, and I'm calling the Hubert

14:28.345 --> 14:41.377
era and the Corrigan era because it was almost 10 
distinct years for each one so far, was there a

14:28.345 --> 14:41.377
change in emphasis on any of those? Was there more 
towards research or more towards teaching, or

14:41.817 --> 14:49.144
were they balanced fairly well under both? 
administrations?

14:54.849 --> 15:03.680
If I had to come down, I would come down and decide 
that yes, in that aspect, the balance was

14:54.849 --> 15:03.680
maintained.

15:06.804 --> 15:17.697
One of the areas that I recall that illustrated 
this was the area of what should be required of the

15:18.250 --> 15:24.697
Ed.D. as compared to what should be required for 
the Ph.D. And when the language requirements for

15:24.717 --> 15:45.338
the Ph.D.

15:24.717 --> 15:45.338
more or less went by the board and they brought in 
other areas, statistics and other things that the

15:24.717 --> 15:45.338
person could used to show competence to become the 
PhD title. There was a language requirement you

15:51.086 --> 15:54.530
had to take beforehand? Oh, yes. PhD required 
language. And I remember vividly

15:57.153 --> 16:13.330
everyone, of course, not everyone, most everyone 
felt that that was the most difficult thing to

15:57.153 --> 16:13.330
overcome for the PhD. And up to and including an 
actual program that took place and had some

16:17.195 --> 16:45.683
students involved in it, in which the 
Czechoslovakian language department set up an

16:17.195 --> 16:45.683
area of coursework, more or less through a summer 
type of thing and other things. If the individual

16:46.709 --> 16:55.819
showed confidence at the end of the set of programs 
or courses that he or she took, they would then be

16:46.709 --> 16:55.819
certified. And this was just one of the many ploys 
that the people used trying to overcome this

16:55.839 --> 17:02.226
hurdle. Was this a PhD in education? Was it just in 
one department? Or was the PhD requirement in all

17:07.772 --> 17:11.656
the departments very similar? The PhD 
requirement in all of the departments that could

17:14.384 --> 17:19.450
offer the PhD, it was similar. And the college 
then, when this surfaced, the college went

17:20.151 --> 17:33.726
through a pretty good

17:20.151 --> 17:33.726
review program of what should be required. And 
they came up with some very, I think, good

17:34.427 --> 17:39.733
standards to show this. what would be required for 
the PhD and what would be required for the EdD. Is

17:44.243 --> 17:46.866
that pretty much what's in place at this time, you 
think? As far as I know, I think it is. This is a

17:50.511 --> 18:01.626
struggle that is pretty well ended by now, but many 
universities went through it. I think in terms of

18:01.646 --> 18:10.058
the University of Illinois, the University of 
Illinois, for the PhD, in addition to the

18:01.646 --> 18:10.058
language, they had a don't hold me to these 
figures, would take 34 hours beyond the master's

18:11.219 --> 18:22.569
degree was sufficient for the coursework, plus 
the language. If you went the EDD route, it was 68

18:22.589 --> 18:25.592
hours. And they just doubled the language. They 
just doubled the hours requirement if you wanted

18:28.154 --> 18:31.096
to go that way. And our college was trying to get the 
distinction between the dissertation, and that

18:32.197 --> 18:40.905
was Hubert's main point, that one of the major 
things would be the dissertation would be a

18:41.543 --> 18:51.298
completely different form for the PhD and the EdD. 
And I'll do violence to his philosophy, I know, but

18:51.318 --> 18:56.325
I'm trying to recall what it was. Basically, the 
EdD could be a study that would be useful for the

18:57.607 --> 19:05.579
practicing professional. And it could be limited 
to a school district, a state, or some small area.

19:11.935 --> 19:24.026
The PhD, I wouldn't say would have to be 
impractical, but would not be limited to and would

19:11.935 --> 19:24.026
not normally be that type of thing. But the major 
thing that Dean Hubert and the faculty were after

19:24.487 --> 19:41.503
was, some of the faculty anyway, was that the 
research should be germane to the national or

19:24.487 --> 19:41.503
international level. could be generalized, and 
your sample

19:41.821 --> 20:02.647
must be nationwide,

19:41.821 --> 20:02.647
so that the usual way of doing your research would 
not normally fill that type of thing. Now, whether

20:02.667 --> 20:11.018
this still is in existence, I don't know, but there 
was a great deal of discussion, and But that was the

20:11.774 --> 20:17.001
major recollection I have of that area. And what 
the current difference is, I don't know.

20:26.655 --> 20:35.107
During the time that you were here as a professor 
and then in the administration as well, there was

20:26.655 --> 20:35.107
tremendous growth in the College of Education. 
Did that have any effect on the way that you were

20:35.408 --> 20:41.376
able to work with the students?

20:41.980 --> 20:56.674
growth, the major growth, came after I kind of 
moved up in 72, I believe it was, into the associate

20:41.980 --> 20:56.674
dean office of student affairs. And the growth at 
that time was

20:58.295 --> 21:09.085
actually a problem for the college.

21:16.607 --> 21:31.968
We were, as the university started bringing in a 
goodly large number of students, some of the

21:16.607 --> 21:31.968
students, to be brutally frank, did not belong at a 
competitive university such as Texas A&M. And

21:33.070 --> 21:38.177
after a year or so attempting some of the more 
rigorous curriculum, the sciences, the

21:38.562 --> 21:53.081
engineering, the students would find themselves 
on probation, below two point, this type of thing.

21:53.101 --> 22:07.000
And there was a feeling on the part of the campus 
that the College of Education would make an ideal,

21:53.101 --> 22:07.000
and I'm being very pejorative, dumping ground for 
that type of student. And the difficulty we ran

22:07.992 --> 22:22.849
into was that many of the students who had been 
chewed up by the system really were good students

22:07.992 --> 22:22.849
and had just made mistakes or had just not really 
found themselves. And then there were a

22:23.510 --> 22:30.058
considerable number of students who were just 
flat not interested. And the problem came in that

22:30.919 --> 22:34.523
the volume made it difficult to find out which 
category a student might logically fit. So the

22:42.364 --> 22:54.880
dean's office at the time was the control point as 
to whether a student would or would not be

22:42.364 --> 22:54.880
permitted to come into the college.

22:57.764 --> 23:02.350
The college fought successfully to

23:05.317 --> 23:06.198
like this control. There were actions that people 
were trying to say that any student could go to any

23:07.399 --> 23:16.907
other college and that you had to accept them. And 
this was eventually determined that the college

23:16.927 --> 23:27.217
would make the decision as to whether a student 
could or could not be admitted. And that once a

23:27.237 --> 23:32.621
student was enrolled in the university, it didn't 
mean they had carte blanche to go to any college.

23:32.641 --> 23:34.463
And it's politics, pure and simple. But the 
College of Education did not need a reputation for

23:35.118 --> 23:43.669
becoming the dumping ground for the other 
students. We were attempting to establish our own

23:44.310 --> 23:48.015
standards. One of the things that the college did, 
and it was a very

23:49.016 --> 24:02.374
thorough review before it was done, and that was to 
require a 2.25 minimum grade point average. To

24:10.006 --> 24:13.131
transfer or just to enter? To enter at the junior 
level. And

24:17.156 --> 24:22.624
the dean's office was given authority make 
exceptions and so on and so forth, and put them on

24:23.043 --> 24:27.710
probation and trials and this. We had all kinds of 
varieties of ways. Do you know when that occurred,

24:29.592 --> 24:31.515
more or less? I can find out. Ah. Early on. 
Seventy-four, seventy-five, somewhere around

24:37.043 --> 24:39.386
there. Okay, in the early seventies. And the other 
colleges were not very happy about it, but we could

24:41.449 --> 24:51.784
cite the need for competent individuals and so on 
and so forth and this type of thing. Did they have

25:00.446 --> 25:07.395
the same procedure or the same criteria as the 
other colleges, or were they forced to admit

25:00.446 --> 25:07.395
anybody they wanted to? I mean, that they wanted to 
in. You mean the other colleges? Uh-huh. No,

25:10.899 --> 25:17.006
eventually they all accepted the fact that the 
college would be the determining factor. Sure.

25:20.215 --> 25:26.322
trend was to go into the sciences and others and 
then come out of them. We had a few that came into

25:26.683 --> 25:29.746
college and then went to the sciences. In other 
words, it was primarily a one-way traffic. And as I

25:33.891 --> 25:39.678
say, we realized that many of them were excellent 
students, and they became good teachers, I

25:33.891 --> 25:39.678
believe. And others were just... Well, even now, 
the numbers that Brian Cole was sharing with me

25:40.339 --> 25:50.070
about the size of a freshman class in the College of 
Education The senior is astounding. I was very

25:52.818 --> 25:54.761
surprised. That trend, very few youngsters come 
to education straight out of high school. Very

26:01.092 --> 26:02.755
few. They come to it as a result of trying various 
other areas and then finally deciding that this is

26:02.915 --> 26:09.987
the area. And again, it's still the same problem. 
Someone has to make the decision. Is the fellow or

26:14.249 --> 26:22.258
the person, the woman, serious, or are they just 
looking for a place to be able to stay in?

26:24.981 --> 26:35.013
At the time that you were involved with the 
college, was there much collaboration among the

26:24.981 --> 26:35.013
departments within the college and then outside 
of the college with others? Well, of course, the

26:35.033 --> 26:42.822
collaboration came, and this is a distinction I 
think I can make, King Hubert was sitting there,

26:43.392 --> 26:46.016
and Dean Corrigan was sitting over here. The 
collaboration came in different manners. The

26:51.263 --> 27:04.421
major vehicle for collaboration was this 
poly-pound, the policy committee meeting, which

26:51.263 --> 27:04.421
was the meeting of the dean, the associate deans, 
all the department heads. And this was usually

27:04.841 --> 27:08.927
held, I think it was every Tuesday at 10 o'clock. 
And if you have never gotten those meetings, the

27:09.025 --> 27:17.980
copies of those meetings, it's quite likely that 
they're over in the archives. And they would give

27:18.000 --> 27:28.757
you precise data and information that you cannot 
get from, you know, old Codger's recall, which is a

27:18.000 --> 27:28.757
very poor way of recalling it. But that, if I 
recall, one of the functions I had was retiring

27:28.777 --> 27:34.206
records. and putting them into the archives, we 
normally always had copies of the policy

27:34.405 --> 27:41.538
committee meetings. And they were held weekly, 
generally, pretty religiously. And this was

27:46.909 --> 27:56.667
where the collaboration, cooperation, came

27:46.909 --> 27:56.667
in. The style of the two deans is the point that I 
think I'll move into now, and that is that with Dean

27:57.524 --> 28:13.622
Yilbert, he had a style which was more directive in 
nature. He felt that his role in the leadership of

28:14.483 --> 28:26.637
the college was to provide the clear-cut goal and 
direction, and this is the area who we should go.

28:28.928 --> 28:38.717
And generally, he had a very clear outline of the 
program that he wanted and the direction he wanted

28:28.928 --> 28:38.717
the college to go. And the policy committee 
meetings under Dean Hubert were more informative

28:39.498 --> 28:54.632
to be told and to be made aware of areas that we were 
going to move into, or areas that we were going to

28:55.000 --> 29:00.645
change in this type of way. Who attended those? The 
department heads. All the department heads, the

29:02.827 --> 29:08.352
dean, and the associate deans.

29:11.695 --> 29:14.758
They were actually, as I say, that was the policy 
committee. They made it. But always, usually,

29:15.919 --> 29:19.782
Hubert would bring an agenda. Frequently, there 
would be a discussion type of thing But the

29:25.392 --> 29:32.179
direction was usually fairly clear.

29:32.199 --> 29:37.564
When Corrigan came, there was 180 degree change. 
Now, a problem was outlined. And the question was,

29:41.969 --> 29:44.651
where do we go? And it was very interesting to watch 
the department head struggle with that. Because

29:50.938 --> 29:55.062
the day before, they had not had to make these kinds 
of decisions. And I admire both men. I've enjoyed

29:59.269 --> 30:01.191
their acquaintances. But Dean Corrigan stayed 
with it and forced the department heads and then

30:03.333 --> 30:13.325
the faculty to make decisions. And completely 
different styles of leadership. Two very

30:19.152 --> 30:24.238
effective styles of leadership.

30:26.125 --> 30:33.775
I would be... Theory-wise, what would you, how 
would you... Theory-wise, you're talking to a man

30:26.125 --> 30:33.775
who spent most of his adult life in the military. I 
like a leader who says, there it is, that's what

30:34.276 --> 30:37.881
we're going for, let's go. Let's talk about it, but 
let's go. I find that I have an old saying, it's

30:42.327 --> 30:53.162
called the pooling of ignorance, when you get too 
much of the other, because there are so many facets

30:42.327 --> 30:53.162
to a problem that are not available for the 
department head. True. So it's hard for them to be

30:59.535 --> 31:00.799
aware. So it's really hard. I think you need a 
system whereby they would
