00:01.988 --> 00:03.150
Testing, testing.

00:03.931 --> 00:05.854
Testing, one, two, three, four.

00:05.874 --> 00:08.638
Test, one, two, three, four.

00:08.658 --> 00:18.613
This is February 6th, and we're at 309 Pershing, and I have the pleasure of chatting with Bill Kling.

00:18.633 --> 00:20.076
Bill Kling, class of?

00:20.096 --> 00:21.598
53.

00:21.618 --> 00:21.878
53.

00:21.898 --> 00:29.430
Mr. Kling, to introduce yourself to anyone who might hear this tape or read the transcription,

00:30.203 --> 00:36.191
Talk about your family and your days before World War II.

00:36.211 --> 00:39.436
Where did you grow up, what did you do, and so forth?

00:39.456 --> 00:49.489
I was born in Limestone County in 1919 on March the 8th in the town of Cossie.

00:50.951 --> 00:51.852
I grew up there.

00:56.118 --> 00:59.603
My grandparents were in the cotton gin business.

01:00.528 --> 01:01.850
My father worked there.

01:01.890 --> 01:15.328
In 1927 or 28, we moved out to the little community of Stranger, about seven miles west of Cossie, between Cossie and Marlin.

01:17.351 --> 01:24.882
Stayed there till the people who hired him to run the Stranger Gin went broke.

01:25.563 --> 01:29.488
The gin was financially

01:30.835 --> 01:42.228
without money, so we moved into a, moved into what was in the teacherage there where the school teachers lived.

01:42.248 --> 01:57.045
Stayed there for a year or less and then moved on a big farm up, a steel farm up north of Stranger and still about six or seven miles west of Cossie.

01:59.067 --> 02:15.468
I grew up there, went into town, stayed with my grandmother, Stuart, and graduated from high school in 1936 from Cossie.

02:15.488 --> 02:16.469
How big was your high school?

02:16.489 --> 02:17.771
How many in the senior class?

02:18.933 --> 02:21.616
Probably 15, maybe 20.

02:24.680 --> 02:28.585
I played all of the sports, not too well,

02:29.307 --> 02:36.133
the necessities, the scarcity of students there.

02:38.375 --> 02:46.563
After I graduated in 1936, my dad and family moved up into the Panhandle to Borger.

02:48.184 --> 02:58.133
My dad worked in the oil fields in the early days, mainly as a fireman.

02:58.602 --> 03:14.396
rigs were all steam powered and having grown up in a steam powered cotton gin, he knew the workings of steam machinery and so he worked as a fireman in the oil field and worked around in the panhandle area up there.

03:16.558 --> 03:27.748
And I guess we stayed up there less than a year, came back, moved out back into the same house we'd left from out west of town,

03:29.450 --> 03:41.688
And in 1937, I guess, he moved down on the, down on the coast and went to work for J.S.

03:41.788 --> 03:54.907
Abercrombie and the whole ocean oil field in Matagorda County, in Missouri County.

03:54.927 --> 03:57.651
I went to Dallas and worked up there.

03:59.622 --> 04:18.009
in 37, mainly doing odds and ends and working in a fast food place, what was then known as the pig stands, which would have burger forerunners of the barbecue places.

04:18.950 --> 04:23.697
Where was the, because we used to stop at the pig stand out by White Rock Lake.

04:24.398 --> 04:27.823
The one I worked at was on Forest Avenue,

04:28.867 --> 04:36.716
about, I don't remember the cross streets, but it was about two or three miles from the fairground.

04:37.116 --> 04:57.118
But the streetcar and the traffic all going to the fairground, and of course in 37 they was having the Pan American Exposition, which was the sort of the thing that followed the Texas Centennial celebration, which the big Texas

04:57.942 --> 05:00.625
to do at that point in time was in Dallas.

05:00.705 --> 05:08.835
And of course, Fort Worth didn't quite agree with that since they had Casa Manana and other things related to that.

05:09.175 --> 05:17.745
But in 1937, I came home to Bay City for Christmas.

05:20.288 --> 05:27.477
In between Christmas and New Year's, Christmas of 37, New Year's of 38,

05:28.638 --> 05:40.351
My mother sent me over to the little corner grocery store to get a loaf of bread or something she needed for supper, and I got acquainted with the owner of the store.

05:42.293 --> 05:48.700
And I asked him if there's a place I could go to work around that room, a job, you know, think about a job.

05:50.081 --> 05:58.510
He said, well, his brother was a county surveyor and engineer that worked for Matagorda County,

05:59.485 --> 06:04.830
And he was starting a project in January, and he thought he might need a hand or two.

06:05.751 --> 06:10.756
So I went down and talked to John Rother, and he said yes.

06:12.738 --> 06:22.567
He needed somebody to cut brush and work on a survey crew, starting right after the first of the year.

06:22.607 --> 06:26.731
And if I'd bring my lunch and come down there, I'd go to work.

06:26.891 --> 06:29.053
He probably had two or three

06:30.097 --> 06:31.639
weeks of work.

06:31.659 --> 06:36.824
Well that was in January of 1938 and I'm still on that project.

06:41.249 --> 06:42.791
So that's the way I got introduced.

06:43.592 --> 06:51.881
Not quite to the, to the survey and engineering profession which has been my career for all my life.

06:51.901 --> 06:55.665
My first introduction to surveying was

06:57.333 --> 07:05.164
I guess 1933 or 34, when the government began to subsidize farmers.

07:06.746 --> 07:19.523
So they had a program that if you had over a certain amount of your acreage in cotton, if you would ply up cotton, the government would pay you for it.

07:19.543 --> 07:24.009
At that point in time, cotton was in the neighborhood of a nickel a pound.

07:26.092 --> 07:26.833
Really wasn't too

07:27.488 --> 07:29.731
too profitable to raise cotton.

07:29.751 --> 07:37.760
So they sent Mr. Honeycutt out to measure the cotton acreage, and I was assigned to help him.

07:38.561 --> 07:52.197
Well, he had on high top boots and a very distinguished looking man, and I was impressed with him, and I thought, well,

07:53.273 --> 07:55.876
Maybe someday I'll get to be doing something like that.

07:55.916 --> 07:58.118
Well, I'm still working on that project, too.

07:58.938 --> 08:04.804
All right, now you started that in the late 30s, and did you stay with that until the war started?

08:05.064 --> 08:05.425
I did.

08:05.445 --> 08:14.113
I started working on a survey crew, the lowest person on a survey crew.

08:14.153 --> 08:21.340
In 1941, I was running in charge of a survey crew for John Rother.

08:24.222 --> 08:51.867
And of course the World War II was going on in Europe and the draft was in effect here and my draft number came up and I was ordered to report to the draft board for induction and was told at that time due to my job with the county which was about a half of our work that I was entitled to

08:52.673 --> 08:55.075
to a one-year deferment if I chose to take him.

08:56.337 --> 09:02.563
I thought, well, I'll just go ahead and serve my year in the military and get out and go on about my business.

09:03.704 --> 09:22.562
So I went into the military in October of 1941, and I got out in April or May, maybe it was June, 1946.

09:25.225 --> 09:27.828
I went in, of course, as a private.

09:28.169 --> 09:37.862
I later on went to officer's training school and was commissioned in the field artillery.

09:38.683 --> 09:51.520
Due to my training prior to service, I was assigned in the field artillery to the survey end of,

09:53.288 --> 10:22.637
of field artillery, which uses lots of surveyors, and was sent to Fort Sill to, for my training to what the military called an instrument and survey school up there, and I took basic training along with that, with that school, but when I finished that, finished that schooling, I was assigned to the Fort Fifth Division, which was Oklahoma National Guard,

10:23.157 --> 10:25.439
and they had just been called into service.

10:27.941 --> 10:41.194
And I was assigned to them, stayed at Fort Sill for a few weeks, maybe a few months, then went to Camp Barkley, out close to Abilene.

10:41.214 --> 10:51.443
We moved into a cotton patch and set up tents with the cotton stalks still on the ground out there while they were building the barracks at Camp Barkley.

10:52.385 --> 10:55.108
Where were you on December 7, 1941?

10:55.609 --> 10:59.694
And how did you hear the news?

11:03.758 --> 11:08.224
We had, I guess we had moved into barracks.

11:10.586 --> 11:14.992
Yeah, we had moved into the barracks there.

11:17.915 --> 11:22.240
Oh wait a minute, 1941 I was still at Fort Silt.

11:22.591 --> 11:39.045
So, of course, this was on Sunday, and I was just around the barracks there on Sunday when somebody came out and said it's a Japanese bombardment harbor, and they'd heard it on the radio, so we all gathered around the radio and listened to that.

11:40.506 --> 11:51.636
There was not too much commotion there except about 2 o'clock that night, Sunday night, the early morning of 8th of December,

11:52.190 --> 11:55.935
They got us all up and made us turn in all of our gas masks.

11:56.035 --> 12:08.171
We'd been issued gas masks, and these gas masks were shipped to the west coast in case of an attack by the Japanese there, something of that sort.

12:08.191 --> 12:12.197
All right, then after serving here in Texas, then where?

12:14.079 --> 12:20.087
Well, with the Oklahoma National Guard, we went to Barkley,

12:21.248 --> 12:39.704
Then from Barkley we went to, I had to look at a map, but we went to one of the old forts in Massachusetts, one of the permanent forts up there.

12:39.724 --> 12:42.026
But we didn't stay there very long.

12:42.126 --> 12:50.614
We moved down to a little community, East Falmouth.

12:51.775 --> 13:06.412
And there we were doing the training and set up the procedure that was later used throughout the Pacific and on D-Day for landing craft on the beaches.

13:07.213 --> 13:19.707
So we'd go out and get on a mock-up ship out in the bay and then we'd load on to landing craft and they would, when we first started out,

13:20.311 --> 13:24.596
I was carrying more stuff than you could get in the back of a big pickup.

13:27.379 --> 13:29.221
Playing tables, aiming circles.

13:31.923 --> 13:34.026
Must have been 150 pounds of gear.

13:35.527 --> 13:43.356
When we got through, I was carrying a front and compass and a pair of field glasses and a map case.

13:46.359 --> 13:50.183
So that was the...

13:50.500 --> 14:02.692
Then later on, that fall when it got too cold and we'd already finished up that project, we moved up to Pine Camp, New York.

14:04.734 --> 14:08.999
And this, we moved up there I guess in October.

14:10.841 --> 14:17.267
One of the most beautiful drives I have ever seen was driving up the Hudson Valley in that

14:17.602 --> 14:32.606
the Anirondack Mountains during the time of the year when the foliage was changing, and we moved up there into Pine Camp, New York, and of course then we were on maneuvers against the 2nd Army Division up there.

14:35.070 --> 14:44.284
The coldest I've ever been was I guess on Lake Huron, with the snow about two feet deep and sleeping in pup tents out there.

14:44.787 --> 14:52.536
and you could put on enough clothes to stay warm with that moist air blowing off the lake there.

14:54.157 --> 15:04.529
And it was at that time that I took a test to see if I qualified to go to Officer's Training School.

15:05.310 --> 15:08.754
And I left from there and went back to Fort Sill.

15:08.774 --> 15:14.440
And I'd have to think about it, but I guess it was

15:17.862 --> 15:26.211
About December of 42, I was commissioned second lieutenant in the field all the time.

15:28.233 --> 15:45.912
Given the leave to come home for a couple of weeks, and I came home and visited my parents, and then I went back to Camp Maxie, which was up in northeast Texas, not far from Paris, Texas.

15:47.984 --> 16:13.542
We were just forming the 102nd Division, just bringing the cadre in and the personnel in, and I was assigned to the 380th Field Artillery Battalion, whose commander was Colonel James Hannigan, who was later came here as David Menn under Earl Rudder.

16:14.423 --> 16:16.005
What kind of a colonel was he?

16:16.867 --> 16:17.788
He was a light colonel.

16:18.224 --> 16:19.646
No, but I mean as a person.

16:19.986 --> 16:24.852
Oh, he was a West Point graduate, of course, and a fine man.

16:24.872 --> 16:37.527
I was in a battery A, one of the batteries, and as an officer I was a reconnaissance officer.

16:39.069 --> 16:43.354
So the way I would know him and my dealings with him was

16:46.186 --> 16:49.029
at staff meetings, things of that sort.

16:50.991 --> 17:02.984
Later on, I was moved up to battalion headquarters and put in charge of the battalion survey group.

17:04.426 --> 17:15.298
We went on maneuvers up there at Camp Maxey, and this was January of 43, as I recall.

17:19.210 --> 17:33.783
Typical Texas weather, we left camp about, left our barracks about seven, eight o'clock, shirt sleeve weather, and by noontime it was snowing and cold.

17:36.366 --> 17:47.496
Most of our people in the division had come out of the Chicago, New Jersey, Pittsburgh area.

17:48.286 --> 17:51.369
none of them much had been off the sidewalks.

17:52.110 --> 18:02.600
This was their first experience out in the field and they didn't have the foggiest idea of how to, how to manage out there.

18:03.861 --> 18:16.774
Having grown up on the farm and whatnot, well I, we got some fires going and whatnot, and later on I found an old building out there and put some

18:18.847 --> 18:35.526
tin or something up over the windows and blacked it out and used a Coleman lantern for light and we were doing survey computations on a survey problem out there.

18:35.546 --> 18:48.600
When the inspectors, the officers that were grading, seeing how well we performed out in the field came around and I suppose as a result of

18:48.968 --> 19:02.040
With that action, I was moved to Division Artillery Headquarters and put in charge of the division, the artillery surveyors there.

19:03.962 --> 19:17.895
My first assignment up there was as an aide to General Busby, and then I was moved to the S2 section, the Intelligence section, as an assistant

19:18.247 --> 19:29.739
intelligence officer who is the person that's in charge of surveying for the battalion, as well as intelligence.

19:31.101 --> 19:41.372
And I was in that capacity until we went to Europe, landed in September in France, in Surberg, France.

19:42.052 --> 19:42.993
September of 44?

19:43.013 --> 19:44.535
44.

19:45.556 --> 19:47.258
We were the first troops to come.

19:47.744 --> 19:53.010
directly from the States to France without going through England.

19:53.030 --> 20:00.238
So then you're part of the group going across northern France.

20:00.599 --> 20:01.059
That's right.

20:01.700 --> 20:05.504
And our unit was next to the British all the way.

20:05.564 --> 20:13.193
We were the most northern American unit.

20:15.235 --> 20:16.637
My first assignment

20:17.056 --> 20:26.910
There, well, after I got off the boat, the first assignment was to clear a minefield.

20:26.930 --> 20:40.769
When I told them that I was through, I cleared this path through the minefield, they said, well, you get in this tank and you ride with them if they drive through this.

20:40.789 --> 20:44.194
I did, and we made it all right.

20:45.997 --> 20:52.765
But it made you think, then, about how careful you'd be.

20:52.785 --> 20:55.848
Now, were you all in, under Patton's command?

20:56.249 --> 20:56.589
No.

20:56.970 --> 21:03.457
No, I was under Keating.

21:03.517 --> 21:13.168
General Keating was the division commander, and Hodges, I believe, because Hodges was the,

21:13.857 --> 21:15.258
12th Army, I believe.

21:16.039 --> 21:16.560
I think so.

21:16.860 --> 21:22.305
That was next to the British.

21:22.325 --> 21:32.595
Another one of my, of course, we, they, after that, the next assignment we had was to run what we called, what the military called the Red Ball Express.

21:34.076 --> 21:42.784
The Red Ball Express was a convoy of trucks, and when I say convoy, there was about 500 in that

21:42.950 --> 21:46.716
two and a half ton trucks and trailers.

21:46.736 --> 21:57.271
They'd set up a road from the beaches one way to the front lines and another road system one way going back.

21:57.291 --> 21:58.453
Had two camps.

21:59.555 --> 22:05.083
The round trip was about 500 miles.

22:07.426 --> 22:11.893
We had a camp at the halfway point on each side

22:14.033 --> 22:20.859
A driver, an assistant driver, got in the truck and drove it until it quit running.

22:20.879 --> 22:41.717
And we had, of course it stopped for fuel and that sort of thing, but it ran until it broke down and then we had wreckers and things that, if it couldn't get back to a shop to where it took it in, they passed it up and got it back to running and did the same thing over again.

22:42.157 --> 22:43.298
But that was the way

22:43.818 --> 22:56.176
The material was moved, everything from drinking water to ammunition and food and whatever was moved up to the front lines.

22:57.578 --> 22:59.822
Were you all involved in the Battle of the Bulge area?

23:00.963 --> 23:13.622
Well, after, after the, after we got through with the, or another unit came in and took over the operation of the Red Ball Express, we went into, into combat.

23:14.868 --> 23:36.857
in Holland, and we are the first real tough fighting that we were involved with was going through the Siegfried Line, which was the boundary between Germany and Belgium and Holland.

23:39.140 --> 23:44.487
We got through that and went up as far as the Ruhr River,

23:46.053 --> 24:09.803
and they would not let us cross the Ruhr because there was some dams upstream from us that were still in German hands, and they were afraid if we crossed and put in temporary bridges and whatnot that the Germans would destroy these dams on these reservoirs up there and knock out the bridges and we'd be isolated over there.

24:09.823 --> 24:11.065
So they waited till they...

24:11.585 --> 24:12.846
until they took those.

24:13.327 --> 24:17.612
Well, in that winter, of course, was when the Battle of the Bulls was.

24:17.632 --> 24:29.206
The Battle of the Bulls was upstream from us or to our south.

24:29.226 --> 24:39.077
They moved us out to where we had about 50 miles of front line between us and the Germans that we were responsible for.

24:39.479 --> 24:51.391
In fact, the day that the Germans attacked, I had found out that my brother, who was in the second division, was in, just out of Luxembourg.

24:51.411 --> 24:55.475
And I got permission to go down there and visit them.

24:56.876 --> 25:05.925
And I was on my way down there, and I, and when I got into the town of Luxembourg, the MPs and everybody already had

25:07.002 --> 25:15.911
had word out that everybody returned back to their units, and so I never did, I didn't get to see him.

25:16.432 --> 25:33.870
My brother was in the second division, he was on the front lines when the Germans attacked, and he was cross-bitten, and evacuated to France, I mean to England,

25:35.673 --> 25:38.097
feet were frozen.

25:38.257 --> 25:49.313
He recovered from that and went back to duty in, I believe they were in Czechoslovakia in the second division when he went back into that.

25:49.333 --> 25:51.517
But essentially the war was over at that time.

25:51.577 --> 25:57.025
That is the fighting part of it, was over at that time.

25:57.466 --> 26:05.157
We crossed the, after the Battle of the Boards was over, we crossed the Ruhr River

26:05.980 --> 26:28.880
went into the town of Creightville, which is on the Rhine, and then we went around the industrial rural valley of Germany on the north and northeast side of it there.

26:29.000 --> 26:34.485
The basic strategy there was not to

26:35.697 --> 26:40.963
take the rural valley, but to surround it, cut it off, and isolate it, which they did.

26:40.983 --> 26:46.489
And it wasn't long, of course, until they surrendered.

26:47.590 --> 26:52.736
Where were you when the war was over?

26:52.756 --> 26:58.262
I was on the Elb River.

26:59.575 --> 27:01.177
up to the Elb.

27:01.197 --> 27:10.611
In fact, we had crossed the Elb and gone another 10-15 miles with little or no resistance from the Germans.

27:10.631 --> 27:21.347
Of course, the Elb was the line in which Stalin and Roosevelt and the British and Churchill

27:22.036 --> 27:32.048
agreed as far east as the Allies or Germany, I mean the United States of Great Britain would go.

27:36.453 --> 27:39.396
So we just, we sat there on the Elbe River.

27:40.718 --> 27:51.250
The Elbe River was, at that point, the place was running nearly north and south, and of course we were on the, on the west bank of it,

27:51.770 --> 27:54.933
and all of the valley is on the east side.

27:55.714 --> 28:10.809
The lowland river plain is on the east side, so we were sitting up two, three hundred feet above this plain and watching the Germans and the Russians fight the war over there.

28:11.950 --> 28:21.760
The Russians built the perimeter around the river, and they were bringing all their people in and crossing the

28:22.550 --> 28:32.784
the Elb River on a destroyed railroad bridge and surrendered to the Americans rather than getting involved with the Russians, which they didn't.

28:35.047 --> 28:37.990
Did you all have any contact at that time with the Russians?

28:40.113 --> 28:43.858
I was one of the first ones to contact the Russians.

28:45.320 --> 28:48.945
I went up and crossed

28:49.988 --> 29:02.263
downstream from where the place I'm talking about on another bridge that had been destroyed that you could still walk across, get across the river on the debris of the remains of the bridge.

29:04.066 --> 29:11.214
I had a sergeant that was Polish descent who could speak Polish.

29:12.176 --> 29:19.725
So I got over there and contacted the Russians, and the Russians found a Russian that could speak Polish.

29:20.718 --> 29:31.948
That's the way we, our conversation went through two interpreters.

29:32.269 --> 29:48.744
One of the first questions that the Russians asked me was, why were the stars on our tanks painted white, where they had the same tank and with a red star on them?

29:48.764 --> 29:49.645
They did not

29:49.777 --> 29:55.222
understand that their equipment was all come lend and lease from the United States.

29:56.584 --> 30:03.731
They thought we were using their equipment, but our star.

30:03.751 --> 30:04.571
Were they pleasant?

30:05.693 --> 30:08.235
Yes, yes, yes.

30:09.096 --> 30:19.446
Of course, they had women in, not really in direct combat, but they were, they had them doing communications things, laying wire,

30:20.033 --> 30:41.012
doing hard physical labor and of course we weren't used to seeing that at that point in time did you all have any kind of social you didn't have did you all have a party with them or a celebration when the war was over when the war was over for the first two weeks i guess

30:43.439 --> 30:46.083
We would alternate nights, having parties.

30:46.103 --> 30:47.806
Every night there was a big party.

30:47.927 --> 30:55.399
One night it'd be on the American side and the United States side, and we hosted it, and the next night it'd be over on the other side.

30:55.680 --> 30:57.202
Where did y'all get the refreshments?

30:58.825 --> 30:59.386
I don't know.

31:00.207 --> 31:03.152
Just from the countryside.

31:03.841 --> 31:05.343
And the Russians were, too.

31:05.603 --> 31:14.255
Of course, we had plenty of GI food, which the Russians lived entirely off the country, almost.

31:14.916 --> 31:24.309
And now they had, of course, ammunition and gasoline was the thing that concerned the Russians.

31:24.790 --> 31:29.596
They had all that.

31:30.418 --> 31:32.160
As you saw their equipment,

31:33.085 --> 31:39.113
and supplies, how did their equipment and supplies compare with ours?

31:39.133 --> 31:50.367
Well, they used a lot of, of course, their trucks and armored equipment was nearly all ours.

31:53.351 --> 31:55.954
Their things like field telephone.
