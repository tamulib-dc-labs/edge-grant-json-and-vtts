WEBVTT

00:07.591 --> 00:07.971
Go ahead. Is it ready to go? Well, after we bought 
this car, people come in the yard to see it. Some of

00:16.841 --> 00:18.703
them say it wouldn't last. Some of them thought it 
was all right. But I think we drove it about 10

00:21.827 --> 00:25.150
years.

00:31.177 --> 00:31.998
Is it going? It's going fine. Go ahead. And, of 
course, then they made things to last. They didn't

00:37.443 --> 00:40.528
make it to wear out and go buy a new one the next day. 
And there has been so many things now, though, that

00:40.568 --> 00:48.841
we didn't have then. I can look back in my kitchen.

00:55.772 --> 00:59.678
When I first kept house, everything was hard. I had 
a wood stove. We didn't buy stuff already prepared

01:06.822 --> 01:10.125
to eat. We had to fix it. And now, I think about the 
young generation. All convenience in the world,

01:16.972 --> 01:19.655
they've got it. And I don't know, they don't keep 
house like I did when I was raising my first

01:21.417 --> 01:27.423
children. And washed, I always had help. I always 
had a colored woman to help me. And she washed on the

01:34.150 --> 01:36.272
washboard. and iron with a flat iron, get that iron 
hot. She'd build up a fire out in the yard with wood,

01:42.836 --> 01:51.105
and she'd put the iron in front of that and get it 
hot, and that's the way she ironed. And now they

01:51.525 --> 01:56.391
have electric iron, and everything's 
perma-pressed. Then everything was starched,

01:56.491 --> 01:59.814
stiff as a poker. Things have come a long, long way, 
I can tell you. At last, they have really made it

02:06.847 --> 02:11.893
easy on the housewife. Do you think it's good or 
bad? Well, I'll tell you what. In a way, it's good.

02:20.042 --> 02:21.744
And in a way, it is not. It has made the young 
housewife lazy. Maybe because she doesn't have to

02:26.410 --> 02:28.032
do as much work. She don't have no hard work to do. 
And they have washing machines. And most every,

02:35.517 --> 02:38.520
now I don't like a dryer. Why is that? Is it stop? Can 
I start? Yeah, go ahead. I'll tell you my objection

02:45.566 --> 02:47.708
to a dryer. They burn the clothes, then the clothes 
is not pretty and white. But I'll say this, it may be

02:52.333 --> 02:58.078
because I'm old fashioned. You can't teach hardly 
an old dog new tricks. And for 83 years, in fact, the

03:03.293 --> 03:10.524
seventh day of May, I'll be keeping house 61 years. 
That's quite a long time. And that's a long time to

03:12.867 --> 03:15.251
have to change. Now, I will admit, I've got all 
convenience. Yes, I've got it. And I appreciate it

03:22.101 --> 03:24.264
and I enjoy it. But don't think that I don't think so 
many times of things that I have done or we have

03:25.245 --> 03:32.676
done, rather. Not I myself, but everybody else did 
the same thing. Like what? Well, look, now,

03:39.147 --> 03:44.014
everything, I even have an electric coffee pot. 
You've got electric toaster. You've got

03:46.398 --> 03:53.828
electric, just everything in the world in your 
kitchen now is electric. I used to make my coffee in

03:53.848 --> 03:59.777
a pot, a coffee pot, put it on the stove, and boil 
those grounds, push it off and let it set a while,

04:00.095 --> 04:06.384
and then pour that coffee in another pot. That was 
coffee. Well, now I either use electric

04:07.706 --> 04:12.172
percolator or drippolator. What kind of cooking 
facilities, you know, say stove or oven or

04:13.234 --> 04:19.904
whatever did you have? I had a wood stove. For 
cooking, too? Yes, sir, a wood stove. And don't you

04:24.971 --> 04:29.798
forget it, that that's the best cooking in the 
world on a wood stove. Now everything's cooked

04:30.335 --> 04:33.118
quick, quick. Get it out of the deep freeze and pop 
it in the stove and cook it quick. Did you, back in

04:37.563 --> 04:44.010
your family, when you grew up as a child, how did you 
heat your house? Well, we had fireplaces. Was it

04:46.193 --> 04:48.115
pretty cold up in Tennessee? Oh, in Tennessee, 
people almost, they still have fireplaces there

04:48.135 --> 04:55.323
because they're on account of the weather. Is that 
cold up there? Oh, me, yes, it's cold there. And

05:00.322 --> 05:04.609
they had wood stoves, of course. People now, they 
have modern homes, I understand now, but the

05:05.450 --> 05:11.420
majority of people have fireplaces. Yeah, 
fireplaces are a thing to have anywhere now. Yeah,

05:13.583 --> 05:20.635
fireplaces now, just like even in Texas now, 
people building new homes, they have fireplaces.

05:20.655 --> 05:22.177
Yeah, yeah. Because, and of course, in my day, wood 
was cheap. When I moved to Hearn, we, that old house

05:28.317 --> 05:37.308
that I sold last year, well, there was fireplaces 
there. And then wood got higher and got to where

05:39.170 --> 05:49.462
you'd have to hire it and cut and everything while 
we had it closed up and got gas heaters. I didn't

05:49.482 --> 05:50.884
know there was a fireplace over there. Oh, yeah. It 
was closed up. There was two of them. There was one

05:54.408 --> 05:57.852
in that north bedroom and one in the living room. 
Oh, no. Even my baby girl, we had it closed up. She

06:07.005 --> 06:14.116
don't remember us having fireplace, and she's 
getting on up there herself. Well, times has

06:14.777 --> 06:17.361
changed so much. Another thing with teenagers, 
they congregate at one's house. And they'd play

06:26.317 --> 06:27.979
cards. They'd play dominoes. And they would have a 
record player. And they'd dance. Was it crank

06:37.509 --> 06:38.670
record player? Yeah. It was called a phonograph. 
You had a great big horn. And you'd turn that thing.

06:47.400 --> 06:50.423
And you'd put a record on there. There's records. 
And the children, they didn't think about getting

06:51.713 --> 07:00.725
in a car and riding out yonder, and there wasn't 
always a car wreck and things then. Well, my first

07:01.826 --> 07:06.493
children, I had two sets of children, same mother 
and daddy. The first four were great big children

07:07.794 --> 07:16.506
when I had these four little girls, and they still 
say they're four little girls. And they didn't

07:18.157 --> 07:24.344
study about going, for they had horse and birdie. 
They met at one another's house. And now they don't

07:26.266 --> 07:29.729
go to one another's house. They get in a car and go 
off somewhere and have a car wreck and somebody get

07:30.330 --> 07:34.935
killed. I think that's one thing, the way that 
makes time so hard is the way people let their

07:34.955 --> 07:44.305
children do now. I think they've brought a whole 
lot of it on themselves. by not being economical.

07:50.908 --> 07:54.214
Now, you take this crisis that we're going through 
with gas. There's plenty of gas and plenty of oil.

07:59.802 --> 08:00.944
It's somewhere else. But we have brought it on 
ourselves, a whole lot of it. I'll tell you, the

08:06.593 --> 08:14.826
majority of people have took living for granted 
that I'm supposed to have this. I don't think

08:17.202 --> 08:20.908
that's right, what you're supposed to have. God 
don't owe you nothing. Amen to that. I agree with

08:25.394 --> 08:26.055
you. But a lot of people think so. God owes them a 
living. This is me. Why can't I have that? You can

08:31.283 --> 08:35.149
have it if you work for it, if you're well and can. Of 
course, there's some people that can't. And I'll

08:38.594 --> 08:43.682
tell you another thing that's changed. People 
used to help each other. If a neighbor got sick, I'd

08:48.915 --> 08:57.327
go over and I'd get their clothes, and we'd wash and 
iron them, take them to them. And we used to make

08:58.268 --> 09:00.271
homemade bread. Make a great big pan of homemade 
bread, bake a hen in dressing, and take it to the

09:01.052 --> 09:08.162
family. People now don't do that. They don't love 
one another like they used to. They don't care.

09:14.864 --> 09:17.147
I'll tell you the way the world is now. Just so me and 
mine is the swimming, you can sink.

09:25.296 --> 09:26.918
Oh, there's been lots of changes. What kind of a 
roads facility did you have around here when y'all

09:27.839 --> 09:31.824
first came here? Oh, we had dirt roads. All of them 
were dirt? No paved highways? No. I forgot what

09:38.071 --> 09:43.217
year it was, but I was living on Market Street when 
they built this highway. Oh, that's what I was

09:44.345 --> 09:45.267
going to ask. Highway 6 didn't exist when you first 
came here then. Huh? You mean Highway 6 didn't

09:48.071 --> 09:50.395
exist when you first came here? Oh, it was a road, 
yes. It was like gravel, you know. It wasn't paved?

09:56.966 --> 09:58.128
It wasn't a mud road. It was gravel like from Dallas 
on into Houston. It wasn't paved? No, no, no, no,

10:02.215 --> 10:05.039
no. And then they paved. And it was narrow. Of 
course, I reckon they thought cars wasn't going to

10:09.121 --> 10:13.447
get plentiful like they are now. And they made it so 
narrow. And I think that's one reason we had so many

10:15.369 --> 10:18.674
car wrecks years ago. When did they pave it? Oh, I 
don't remember what year it was when they paved it.

10:24.842 --> 10:35.537
It

10:24.842 --> 10:35.537
was in the early 40s

10:24.842 --> 10:35.537
when they paved it. And then, of course, I won't 
live to see it, but probably you will, and my

10:36.657 --> 10:46.628
grandchildren maybe, that there will be four-way 
highways everywhere. And whenever they do, you

10:48.090 --> 10:51.794
watch and see, there won't be so many wrecks. I wish 
they had them now. And do you know, Texas, of

10:55.538 --> 11:03.187
course, has wonderful highways, but Tennessee 
has the best highways? Really? What kind of road

11:04.568 --> 11:06.851
did they have when you were growing up there? We had 
pikes. They called them pikes. And they were made

11:10.817 --> 11:13.241
out of pine gravel. Well, was a pike like what we 
call a highway? Yeah, uh-huh. And when it rained,

11:19.731 --> 11:23.717
all that stuff just packed together. You see, it 
didn't get muddy. And that's the kind of sidewalks

11:26.441 --> 11:30.947
people had. Where I was born and reared, I was born 
and married out of the house that I was born in. My

11:39.450 --> 11:46.178
daddy had all around the house, and he had three or 
four barns, and that kind of walkways to the barns.

11:46.879 --> 11:53.467
It was nothing in the world but more of a fine 
dust-like.

11:54.288 --> 11:56.771
And you wet that, and you cemented together. It 
didn't get muddy. What kind of road were you in,

11:58.894 --> 12:01.037
Brian? Same kind over here? just like this, went 
through, narrow. But the road, the old Bryan

12:05.130 --> 12:11.617
Highway, you know where the old Bryan Highway is? 
I've heard about it, but I don't know exactly where

12:11.957 --> 12:13.939
it is. Well, it goes, it went kind of around Bryan. 
You mean it didn't go through it? Mm-mm. Went kind

12:24.751 --> 12:28.775
of, wasn't much to go through of Bryan. I've heard 
that, too. Went kind of around it. Well, I'll tell

12:32.200 --> 12:33.882
you where it goes. You know, like if you are going

12:35.224 --> 12:45.136
in to Bryan, let me see, where is that turn? It kind 
of makes a turn, and there's a road going this way.

12:49.702 --> 12:51.544
Well, that's the old Bryan Highway. Oh, I see. Do 
you remember when they, you know, did this other,

12:53.387 --> 12:56.731
put this other thing in? Oh, yeah. When was that? 
Oh, I don't remember what, yeah. And I remember

13:00.830 --> 13:03.234
when they built the overpass. You know the 
overpass going on to Brown? I remember when they

13:08.001 --> 13:09.403
built that. Daddy helped to build that. You see 
it's got the railroad goes over that. And he helped

13:16.374 --> 13:20.440
to build that, that track across that. Oh, really? 
Mm-hmm. And the old Brown Highway, when you got to

13:22.804 --> 13:27.351
that, where the old place is why you can see some of 
it now the old brown highway went all the way around

13:27.702 --> 13:54.537
i know what you're talking about yeah i know what 
you're talking about that's the way it went i know i

13:27.702 --> 13:54.537
know exactly what you're talking about right now i 
don't think there's anything to it except sort of

13:27.702 --> 13:54.537
uh remains of it you know it's pretty badly torn up 
well now i think all it's used through that old

13:27.702 --> 13:54.537
highway is where people that live back out in there 
it's a way to get in and out to their houses because i

13:54.702 --> 14:21.925
know there is some trailer houses that set back off 
of there in fact people that i know that bought land

13:54.702 --> 14:21.925
and put trailer houses out there and that's all 
that it is it's not kept up it's just kept up by

13:54.702 --> 14:21.925
individuals you know the county don't have to keep 
it up now

13:54.702 --> 14:21.925
anything else uh So what time is it? It's 25 to 6. Is 
there anything else you want to say? This is plenty

14:27.315 --> 14:28.357
for me. I can tell you another improvement that I 
have seen more than anything is in the schools.

14:39.152 --> 14:45.280
Of course, I guess one thing, people didn't have 
the money. to do with, just take like here. People

14:49.687 --> 14:57.995
will say, we don't have a top-notch school because 
we don't have the resources. You see, after they

14:58.055 --> 15:13.529
moved the oil tanks out of here, done away with so 
much railroading, I've seen the time you'd go to

14:58.055 --> 15:13.529
P&M Bank, and you'd have to stand there for, they'd 
be lined up, clear back down to the drugstore.

15:14.250 --> 15:14.490
Really? And we had better schools then than we do 
now. They wouldn't want me to say that, but that's

15:20.010 --> 15:22.452
the truth. Because we had more money. We have to 
take secondary of everything. We have to take

15:28.858 --> 15:32.962
teachers that can't get a job nowhere else. 
There's no school nowhere, hardly, that will work

15:33.963 --> 15:40.749
a teacher now unless they've got two degrees. 
That's true, yeah. Well, we learned about that in

15:42.550 --> 15:44.292
some of the education courses Well,

15:45.537 --> 15:53.027
you just take it this way. When the boys, of course, 
you know yourself, when you finish high school,

15:54.569 --> 16:01.679
you've got to take a test to get in college. And they 
claim that Hearn has less percentage of boys and

16:02.500 --> 16:12.354
girls in college because they can't make the grade 
to get in there. That wouldn't surprise me at all.

16:16.553 --> 16:43.067
surprised me and and i see a big difference in in the 
school and in the method of teaching what was the

16:16.553 --> 16:43.067
method of teaching say when you went to college 
well now i'll tell you it hasn't changed too much in

16:16.553 --> 16:43.067
the method of teaching in their way of teaching uh 
one day i told john we was talking about classes and

16:16.553 --> 16:43.067
uh I was telling John about an English teacher that 
I had in college. Oh, me, his name was White. And he

16:50.408 --> 16:52.870
was hard, hard, hard. And I said, of course, your 
desk don't sit that way. But I said, our desk began

16:57.114 --> 16:59.696
this way. And he said, that's the way ours does. And 
I was shocked. I said, oh, you're kidding. He said,

17:04.921 --> 17:06.042
no, I'm not. I said, well, maybe I'm not too far 
behind yet. That's the way they'll do it. You

17:11.947 --> 17:12.868
couldn't copy. the way the desk set. And when John 
told me, he said, well, that's the way ours set.

17:19.731 --> 17:21.113
Ours is that way now, too. Staggered? Yeah. And I 
said that that's the way ours was. And there's one

17:27.003 --> 17:30.749
thing in college now they do. You see, they grade 
now by points. We graded. You got 85 or you got 90.

17:40.083 --> 17:40.744
You got nothing. There was no points. It wasn't. 
graded down into points. What was the high school

17:46.907 --> 17:47.889
like? Huh? What was the high school like? Well, in 
our school, there was one big room, and everybody

17:51.734 --> 18:02.168
sit in that room. But in the lower grades, while 
they had little annex rooms, like the first grade

18:02.728 --> 18:12.201
and on up, Let's see, on up to the sixth, I think, 
because the seventh and eighth and ninth and on

18:12.873 --> 18:20.905
through that way. We'd go down all that room. I 
think that old schoolhouse is still standing

18:24.550 --> 18:27.935
there. I know the last time I was in Tennessee, I 
always go to that old schoolhouse. And, oh, it's

18:35.146 --> 18:39.252
huge because this was a heavy... community I mean 
it was a lot of people there and I guess there's

18:40.092 --> 19:08.243
maybe 250 students in all there's a whole lot in 
that day and down at the front is where we went down

18:40.092 --> 19:08.243
for classes and everybody else sit back here you 
could sit up there and listen if you wanted to of

18:40.092 --> 19:08.243
course everybody we used to that we knew nothing 
but that we studied and I This school that I went to,

19:08.847 --> 19:12.791
I graduated from 12th grade. And I was 18. No, I 
wasn't 18 when I graduated. And I started college

19:20.978 --> 19:27.725
in 1910.

19:30.467 --> 19:33.290
I started, I went to Teachers College. And that 
college today is a, oh, we, It was a big college

19:37.366 --> 19:39.108
then. I think there's about maybe 1,500 or more. 
And now they have added to it, and it's, well, I

19:43.113 --> 19:54.387
think they've got about between four and 4,500, 
over 4,000.

19:55.128 --> 20:02.337
They started out with it being teacher's college, 
and it wasn't but a year or two until anything you

19:55.128 --> 20:02.337
want to take up. Now, when I started, I majored the 
first, year i majored in english i was going to make

20:07.792 --> 20:37.613
a teacher and then i changed no i no yes i did i 
changed majors then to home ec

20:07.792 --> 20:37.613
and all they were strict oh you think it was more 
strict than they are now oh yeah i think so because

20:07.792 --> 20:37.613
you see that comes again with the modern times with 
so many things to do with we went to We went to

20:37.863 --> 20:39.065
school. There wasn't cars for us to get in. All cars 
was coming in, I understand. How did you get

20:45.193 --> 20:48.257
around? Well, the school was in town, and there was 
buses running to take the children that lived in

20:48.277 --> 20:59.753
town or something, maybe that boarded or 
something. I stayed at the dormitory. And the

21:02.957 --> 21:07.363
dormitory was just horrible. It was about as far as 
from here to DeJulius.

21:13.452 --> 21:19.078
The college was in the center, and the girls was on 
one side and the boys on the other. Sunday evening,

21:20.419 --> 21:22.521
I sat there in the car. I didn't go upstairs. I 
didn't feel like it. And there is the boys'

21:26.766 --> 21:31.571
dormitory right across there. There's the 
girls'. Well, when I grew up, they wouldn't have

21:33.172 --> 21:35.815
nothing like that.

21:38.782 --> 21:41.065
Because of the morality viewpoint then? Then 
there comes the morality viewpoint of it again.

21:45.772 --> 21:48.216
People would have thought that would have just 
been terrible. And another thing, we had at 10

21:49.718 --> 21:59.152
o'clock, everybody had to be in. Lights had to go 
out. Lights had to be out at 10 o'clock. And more

22:07.452 --> 22:10.655
people went to church then. There's more of people 
now. The population is greater. But I don't think

22:15.961 --> 22:18.924
people go to church like they used to. I bet you, 
you're just young, but I bet you, you see a

22:18.944 --> 22:24.950
difference. Yeah, I do. And then when I went to 
college, once a week, we had assembly. We went in,

22:33.619 --> 22:37.003
and the dean of this college He made a talk, and they 
had prayer. We'd sing school songs, and sometimes

22:44.506 --> 22:51.174
they'd sing religious songs, and then they'd have 
prayer. And, of course, now I think that's one of

22:51.634 --> 23:00.564
the ugliest things that's ever happened in a 
schoolroom when they stopped having prayer.

23:02.447 --> 23:05.370
Because that you're one thing and I'm another, 
That prayer shouldn't affect that. And I think

23:08.844 --> 23:13.972
that we certainly owe that much to our Lord that's 
been so good to us. Yeah, I agree.

23:17.858 --> 23:19.721
Okay, do you have anything else you'd like to add? 
Because it's getting pretty late and we need to

23:19.761 --> 23:22.224
conclude this. What was the last thing I said? I 
think the last thing we were talking about... That

23:25.609 --> 23:29.495
we ought to give the Lord... Right, right. I had 
forgotten myself for a second. Well... When any of

23:33.667 --> 23:53.419
this class lives to be 83 years old, I feel like that 
they'll be able, and I hope that they'll be able,

23:33.667 --> 23:53.419
especially by going to A&M, that they can give a 
comment on the past life that they have lived. And

23:53.439 --> 23:57.265
it will be worthwhile to some students. Really a 
great idea. Okay. Do you have anything else you'd

24:00.373 --> 24:02.155
like to add? Okay, if that's pretty well. I 
certainly appreciate you doing this for me. And

24:06.060 --> 24:12.148
thank you for taking the time out of your day to sit 
down and talk with me. I really appreciate this.

24:13.550 --> 24:14.091
Thank you very much. Well, I wish I could have done 
more, but maybe that'll help you some. I think it's

24:21.360 --> 24:22.622
just going to be fantastic. Thank you very much.
