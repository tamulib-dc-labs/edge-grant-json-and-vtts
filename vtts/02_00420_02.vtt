WEBVTT

00:01.718 --> 00:30.595
offensive and right when I was leaving you know 
there was kind of a you know just a change I guess it

00:01.718 --> 00:30.595
didn't seem like it may was a change that had taken 
place in me but some of the people that you know I

00:01.718 --> 00:30.595
would run into and stuff were just weird but I you 
know I don't think you can make sweeping

00:01.718 --> 00:30.595
statements like that about about an entire body of 
people because uh I knew some heroes. I knew some

00:32.599 --> 00:45.452
people who were, you know, up to speed with anybody 
who'd ever come to the assistance of this country

00:32.599 --> 00:45.452
in time of war, ever in the history of America.

00:48.556 --> 00:51.078
So, I don't buy that. I think that maybe the youth of 
the people might have had some effect But most of

01:02.097 --> 01:12.191
the guys that I knew were regular people, and some 
of them better than regular people. But none of

01:12.211 --> 01:20.362
them were, on the average, depraved or anything 
like that, like you would see in movies like

01:12.211 --> 01:20.362
Apocalypse Now and stuff like that. Although 
there were the nuts. They were there. But they were

01:24.608 --> 01:28.434
not the, they were the exception, in my view. An 
exception on it. Oh, yeah. How long were you over in

01:31.865 --> 01:33.827
Vietnam? I was there a little over a year. I stayed 
past the time I had to stay because they had this

01:36.330 --> 01:48.163
deal where if you had less than, I think it was seven 
months left in the Army when you finished your tour

01:36.330 --> 01:48.163
of duty in Vietnam, then you got out of the Army. So I 
stayed there for a month or so extra and got out

01:48.924 --> 01:55.151
early. What was it like to get on the plane and 
realize you were leaving that? It was

02:01.717 --> 02:03.059
interesting. It was good. It was a mess, though, 
when I got down to Cameron Bay. Yeah, I got out of

02:08.567 --> 02:10.349
Cameron. I got there, and things were all screwed 
up, so I went and stayed at a B team right outside of

02:10.930 --> 02:20.784
Cameron Bay. I can't remember what. I think it was 
B35 or something like that. It was at Dombatin

02:26.952 --> 02:30.357
where they had the Special Forces Jump School. 
where we put the Montagnards through paratrooper

02:30.691 --> 02:33.734
training. And I stayed there with a buddy of mine 
that I used to talk to on the radio all the time for

02:35.035 --> 02:42.782
about two weeks. And then went back into

02:44.244 --> 02:50.089
Cameron Bay. And basically, it sucked. Because I 
had been out there. It was like all of a sudden, it

02:55.875 --> 02:59.398
was like this rudely, over-structured 
environment, you know, it was like he'd welcome

02:59.885 --> 03:05.271
back to the bullshit again, you know. I had made the 
rank of sergeant, you know, and they treated us

03:07.113 --> 03:13.259
like a bunch of assholes at Cameron Bay. It was more 
like we were just a bunch of weirdos, you know, to

03:13.680 --> 03:26.854
come down out of the jungle, and they were trying 
real careful to make sure that none of us, you know,

03:13.680 --> 03:26.854
freaked out. After being in Vietnam for all that 
time, and all of a sudden, here I was back at Tan Son

03:27.070 --> 03:41.473
Nhat, or excuse me, Cam Ranh Bay, picking up 
cigarette butts, you know, and kissing ass, and

03:27.070 --> 03:41.473
getting yelled at for not having a haircut. It just 
thoroughly pissed me off. That's exactly how I

03:44.498 --> 03:45.700
felt.

03:48.525 --> 03:52.892
I wanted to, it just thoroughly pissed me off. And 
then you'd wait, you know, and wait, and wait. And

03:56.693 --> 04:03.885
it was like a grinding kind of, you know, well, the 
fuck am I going to get out of here? It was just about

04:04.105 --> 04:06.449
the way I felt by the time I left. In other words, the 
processing that they put you through prior to

04:06.469 --> 04:12.920
leaving the country was sort of demeaning. And I 
didn't have a weapon anymore, except, you know,

04:20.125 --> 04:22.710
Cameron Bay was no big shake, I guess. They got 
rocketed every once in a while, but it was like one

04:22.750 --> 04:27.819
big sandy bunch of bullshit. No trees, no nothing. 
And it was demeaning. I was pissed. And when I got

04:33.589 --> 04:36.976
back to the States, I was thoroughly pissed. How 
did people treat you when you got back? Well,

04:40.302 --> 04:43.888
again, I got out of the Army in Fort Lewis. And I 
guess when you're real close to getting out of the

04:44.290 --> 04:48.955
Army, I think the Army starts to worry about you. 
It's kind of like these guys are real close to

04:48.975 --> 04:51.258
getting out. Anything could happen. It's an 
explosive sort of situation, I think, because

04:53.621 --> 05:05.595
you're this close to not being in the Army anymore, 
and it's just kind of like you're tired of being, as

04:53.621 --> 05:05.595
they say, fucked with. You just want out. So we came 
into Fort Lewis, Washington in the middle of the

05:07.717 --> 05:12.002
night, And the big deal was I hadn't drank fresh 
milk for long. And I was dying for some milk. And the

05:20.973 --> 05:25.117
big deal was that we were going to get steaks and 
milk. So we got there in some mess hall in the middle

05:25.898 --> 05:29.842
of the night. And they gave us these flimsy little 
tough ass steaks. People were ready to throw them

05:33.827 --> 05:36.930
at the walls. Everybody was just pissed. I mean, we 
felt like we were let down right from that point

05:38.071 --> 05:42.816
while we were still in the military. And then 
finally, we got out. They hand you a plane ticket

05:48.389 --> 05:53.215
and a handful of cash and say goodbye. It's up to you 
to find your way to the airport. And you're left

05:56.920 --> 06:02.988
standing at the gate of an Army base with a handful 
of cash and a plane ticket. Because what they do is

06:03.348 --> 06:08.255
they give you a plane ticket back to your home or 
record, wherever that might have been. Of course,

06:08.315 --> 06:09.657
I was in New Jersey. If you had any extra money left 
over, for leave that you didn't take or whatever.

06:17.058 --> 06:19.422
You got that cash when you got out of the service. So 
here's all these lunatics, you know, standing at

06:19.822 --> 06:26.293
the gates of all these pissed off guys, right? 
Standing out in front of Fort Lewis in the middle of

06:26.313 --> 06:34.286
the night with a handful of dollar bills and an 
airplane ticket going, ah, motherfucking shit.

06:34.306 --> 06:39.094
And so you have to take a taxi cab, right, to the 
airport. So we all got to the airport, and all

06:39.631 --> 06:43.135
special forces guys sort of stuck together. 
Immediately we went to the bar and just started

06:43.155 --> 06:46.939
drinking up the bar and just going berserk. And 
then said goodbye to each other. There was this one

06:51.623 --> 06:57.369
guy, this Puerto Rican guy that I had known over in 
Vietnam. But somehow or other, we got out at the

06:57.389 --> 07:01.434
same time and ran into each other at the airport. 
And we flew back to New York together. And the

07:05.578 --> 07:07.680
flight back. That was just kind of like nothing. 
The only, the worst experience I had, I came back

07:12.549 --> 07:30.027
escorting a friend of mine that had been killed, 
and I remember getting on an airplane that time and

07:12.549 --> 07:30.027
sitting down next to this businessman, you know, 
and saying, hey, I just got back from Vietnam. And

07:30.047 --> 07:33.470
he sort of went, oh, I went back to reading this 
newspaper. I was kind of like, you fucking

07:33.490 --> 07:36.233
asshole. I felt like ripping his teeth right out of 
his face and sticking them up his ass. That's

07:41.474 --> 07:43.296
pretty rude, but that's the way I felt. And it was 
kind of like, the second time I came back, it was a

07:44.937 --> 07:58.192
little bit different, because I'd already been 
back once, you know, but the first time I came back,

07:44.937 --> 07:58.192
it was just like, strange-o. I remember coming 
into the military base, and the kind of the

07:58.212 --> 08:06.220
apparent tranquility, you know, of the world, as 
opposed to Vietnam, where you have like, you know,

08:06.520 --> 08:35.886
constant cacophony, you know, people yapping, 
and helicopters flying over all over the place,

08:06.520 --> 08:35.886
and trucks roaring and everything, and people 
yelling, and all of a sudden there were no barbed

08:06.520 --> 08:35.886
wire fences, and there were people in civilian 
clothes, and there were white people, you know,

08:06.520 --> 08:35.886
all over the place, women who weren't and

08:36.254 --> 08:42.703
the contrast between... I remember the first 
thing I thought was, God, these people do not know

08:42.743 --> 08:48.210
how good they have it. They just don't know. They 
just don't know that this is so peaceful, this is so

08:50.133 --> 08:58.164
tranquil, this is so safe. They just don't know how 
good they have it. That was my first basic

09:01.589 --> 09:04.573
impression. The first time I came back. The second 
time I came back, I was pissed. You know, I said, I

09:10.050 --> 09:12.013
want to get out of the Army. You know, I mean, that 
was just bullshit. So, you know, I was, the second

09:17.139 --> 09:26.392
time I was, I was mad, but glad, you know. And my 
family did a real nice job of greeting me. You know,

09:29.115 --> 09:34.262
they had a big, big sign up on the house that said, 
welcome home. And, uh, It was good. One last

09:39.293 --> 09:41.155
question. Do you think we lost the war? Special 
Forces didn't lose the war. Maybe some other

09:47.024 --> 09:50.409
outfit did, but we did our job. When I left Vietnam, 
we had, at that time, a lot of the A camps, except for

09:50.789 --> 10:05.070
the ones right on the border, either up along the 
DMZ or near layoffs, were pretty much pacified.

10:11.903 --> 10:25.962
What they did out on the A camps is they had, what 
they tried to do was set up what he would call, it was

10:11.903 --> 10:25.962
called CIDG, and also Ruff Puff, which were sort of 
like the counterpart of a home militia. So we

10:27.424 --> 10:35.395
trained and equipped, set these people up, sort of 
maintained them, and when they could defend

10:27.424 --> 10:35.395
themselves, you know, their region, you know, 
from insurgency, from these bozo recruiting

10:35.864 --> 10:48.675
campaigns, you know, that would sweep through 
their area every once in a while, and the Special

10:35.864 --> 10:48.675
Forces closed the camp down. And when I left, there 
were, and it wasn't part of Nixon's

10:48.695 --> 10:55.681
Vietnamization program, it was just sort of like 
we had succeeded. And when you look at the rapid

10:56.562 --> 11:04.909
deployment force that they have today that has 
been successful, for example, that lightning

11:05.463 --> 11:08.368
strike they did down there in Grenada. It

11:09.830 --> 11:31.285
was modeled after the Mike Force, which was a 
mobile reaction force that was, instead of going

11:09.830 --> 11:31.285
into the jungle and searching out Viet Cong and 
NVA, what we started to do was wait for them to

11:09.830 --> 11:31.285
attack a village or a camp. And then we had the Mike 
Force, which was like the charge of the Light

11:31.855 --> 11:41.024
Brigade, which would go roar assing in there and 
meet them out in the open and kick the shit out of

11:31.855 --> 11:41.024
them. And that was pretty much what we did. And it 
worked to a certain extent. And this rapid

11:48.831 --> 12:00.782
deployment force that they have now, which is 
basically sort of a counterinsurgency outfit, I

11:48.831 --> 12:00.782
think, is sort of designed, or what they're doing 
down in Guatemala There are special forces guys

12:01.707 --> 12:28.626
down there right now training these people, and 
they probably have like a mobile reaction force

12:01.707 --> 12:28.626
where they wait for the guerrillas to hit the 
government troops, and then these guys just go

12:01.707 --> 12:28.626
tear-assing in there before they can go back and 
hide

12:01.707 --> 12:28.626
and meet them. which was much more effective. See, 
originally, I think, when we went to Vietnam, they

12:31.230 --> 12:43.689
did sort of traditional stuff, where they'd take 
16 million Marines, give them 20 pounds of

12:31.230 --> 12:43.689
ammunition, and say, OK, march, and mow down 
everything in sight. Didn't work. So what we did

12:46.453 --> 12:55.587
was basically counterinsurgency, which had to do 
with waiting, laying in wait, more or less. But

12:56.328 --> 12:58.832
also, around the A camps, they what you would call 
traditional sorts of set up ambushes, sweep

12:59.521 --> 13:08.134
through the area kind of stuff. But whenever we 
made contact, or whenever they made contact, and

13:08.895 --> 13:19.812
if it was sustained, there was always the 
likelihood that they'd call in the mobile team.

13:22.796 --> 13:27.603
Not always, but.

13:27.623 --> 13:28.144
I don't get it. I appreciate it. Sure.

14:09.232 --> 14:31.645
um

14:09.232 --> 14:31.645
