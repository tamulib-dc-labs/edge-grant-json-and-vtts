WEBVTT

00:19.370 --> 00:21.593
Schools, we were going crazy with schools. We were 
building everywhere. You'll notice the schools

00:24.176 --> 00:35.890
are named after people, named after the early 
teachers in the community or the school board, but

00:24.176 --> 00:35.890
we were building as fast as we could get them up 
because the community was growing that way.

00:39.795 --> 00:41.297
Let's see, what else happened? Fabulous, 
fabulous.

00:46.606 --> 00:47.787
I'll have to think on it. We'll go on and on. If I 
think of something, I'll jump back at you. Okay.

00:53.113 --> 00:58.238
Pasadena has had a reputation for many years for 
being a white community. Has the Palmoy family

00:58.258 --> 01:04.905
seen or experienced any changes in race relations 
in Pasadena?

01:11.252 --> 01:14.335
Well, in not the... typical sense that you would 
think of race relations in Pasadena. Pasadena, in

01:19.690 --> 01:25.918
its early days, was, like I said, a settlement of 
farmers. And you had Spanish Mexicans living in

01:26.939 --> 01:34.549
the area at the time being basically dirt farmers 
themselves. And they worked with the local

01:35.129 --> 01:36.731
farmers. And so there's always been a contingency 
of Mexicans in, or Spanish surname, as it were, in

01:44.116 --> 01:46.058
the community of Pasadena. They've never been 
very visible. They have very well hung to

01:48.321 --> 01:50.103
themselves. Most of their... They lived off of... 
They lived out in then the country, but as the

01:54.368 --> 02:00.855
community grew, they concentrated somewhat 
around the Red Bluff area. I know in the 40s, late

02:01.496 --> 02:09.345
40s, early 50s, when I was involved in the church 
myself, we had a mission. We established a Spanish

02:09.445 --> 02:12.148
mission out on... and I'd go out there and do the 
little programs and we'd do Christmas programs

02:12.905 --> 02:19.431
with them and things like that. So there was an 
interaction between them, but there was still a

02:19.451 --> 02:23.875
separation. Went to school with some Spanish 
people. I knew them, they knew me, we talked, but we

02:27.239 --> 02:30.942
didn't socialize together. Most people think in 
terms of race relations as being black relations.

02:36.547 --> 02:39.250
That didn't exist in Pasadena, never has. I have a 
listing of people who signed up for the draft in

02:40.276 --> 02:47.226
1914 in Pasadena. And there were two blacks out of 
about 35 people, Negro. I assumed they would be

02:52.935 --> 02:54.517
Negro farmers. That was probably the highest 
percentages of blacks that we had ever had in the

02:56.861 --> 03:05.153
community. In 1960, Pasadena's population was 
89,000. we had 45 blacks. In 1980, passing the

03:12.212 --> 03:14.876
population is 112,000. We have 950 blacks within 
the community. So there

03:19.043 --> 03:25.113
is, blacks are not visible in the community. 
First, there's not being enough of them. So we

03:27.938 --> 03:30.141
never really had that as a race issue. We are having 
a race, Well, you go back to the Hispanics and

03:35.913 --> 03:38.940
finish that side off. Hispanics

03:38.960 --> 03:45.035
have always had their community, as I have said. 
And as the integration, both legal and illegal,

03:45.716 --> 03:51.390
from Mexico accelerated in the last 10 years in 
Mexico, particularly during the boom days of the

03:51.674 --> 03:58.104
last five years. They found a section over here in 
Pasadena. The two main concentrations of

04:02.451 --> 04:17.334
Hispanics in Harris County are on the east side of 
downtown Houston, one being in the eastern

04:02.451 --> 04:17.334
section of Houston and one being the relatively 
small barrio in the Pasadena area. They're used,

04:17.354 --> 04:19.437
they work in industry. basically non-managerial 
levels because most of them are not educated. They

04:24.954 --> 04:27.799
go through the school systems. But they have, and 
they have in the local community, begun to take

04:27.819 --> 04:33.549
some roles and responsibilities. We have quite a 
few Spanish doctors, attorneys. I don't know

04:38.337 --> 04:39.880
about the CPAs. We've had from time to time some 
Spanish involved in government. Spanish,

04:45.185 --> 04:50.813
probably proportionally-wise, a balanced 
percentage in civic organizations. Never

04:50.893 --> 05:08.257
really been, there's never been a racial clash in 
Pasadena, whether it be Spanish, Negro, Black, or

04:50.893 --> 05:08.257
a problem today, I think it is a problem, or the 
growing concern is the Asian community in

04:50.893 --> 05:08.257
Pasadena. Pasadena is one of us, and it's sort of a 
settlement area for the Asian. It's felt strongly

05:12.744 --> 05:15.107
in the school district. the school district has 
had an increase in Asians in the last, well, I don't

05:15.577 --> 05:30.119
know what it is here in the 80s, but it's something 
like it doubles every year as far as the Asian

05:15.577 --> 05:30.119
population. The Spanish population has grown 
significantly, or

05:30.640 --> 05:44.301
has grown significantly, but it's not as much of a 
teaching problem as it is for the Asians in the

05:30.640 --> 05:44.301
community. as it appears to be typical with the 
race, are very industrious, hard-working

05:44.534 --> 05:49.261
people. I think every 7-Eleven in town is all about 
Asian. They've got businesses in the community.

05:56.893 --> 05:58.676
There's no confrontation with them. So there's 
no, there's been no problems. It's,

06:01.581 --> 06:09.293
each have their own area, but there's no conflict 
over it. How did your parents and family feel about

06:11.787 --> 06:14.871
blacks? And did they support the Brown versus 
Board decision in 1954? Well, when I was in

06:20.417 --> 06:32.412
college, I was asked by a black, you know, well, 
gee, you don't appear to be, you know, the

06:20.417 --> 06:32.412
prejudiced type person I'd expect from the South. 
I said, well, until I got to college, I didn't know

06:33.193 --> 06:35.976
what black was. Said earlier, there really wasn't 
any in Pasadena. Not until the late 50s, when there

06:41.487 --> 06:50.977
became some nationwide agitation, was there any 
visibility of blacks in Houston. And that was the

06:51.458 --> 06:53.740
only place I had contact with, was Blacksville. 
I'd go into Houston.

06:58.926 --> 07:05.233
Never had the discussion with my parents, or my 
grandparents, or my great grandparents.

07:05.669 --> 07:10.974
I've never had a discussion with any of them about 
blacks because we never had that type of contact.

07:11.015 --> 07:14.458
So you wouldn't talk about, well, how do you feel 
about Russians if you've never met a Russian? Or

07:14.578 --> 07:19.924
how do you feel about

07:14.578 --> 07:19.924
someone from Afghanistan? It just wasn't a 
question that was raised in the test and discussed

07:20.444 --> 07:27.852
and talked about. The KKK is located in Pasadena. 
But it's not the Pasadena blacks that they're

07:30.813 --> 07:35.540
working against, because there are so few blacks. 
The only agitations that KKK causes are all

07:35.980 --> 07:40.547
outside of Pasadena. It just happens to be an 
available building in Pasadena. Probably a lot of

07:45.313 --> 07:49.559
the guys work out of the industrial plants, and so a 
convenient place. The thing is open, I think, once

07:49.980 --> 07:51.742
a month. And when they take on the Asians, as 
they've done, down what was tripping boats and all

07:57.577 --> 07:59.699
that stuff. It's always outside of the community. 
For Brown versus Board of Education, again,

08:02.181 --> 08:10.829
that's another thing that really didn't have an 
application in the community because we didn't

08:02.181 --> 08:10.829
have separate facilities. If there was a black in 
the community, it went to Pasadena. If there was

08:14.973 --> 08:19.537
brown in the community, if there were yellow, 
whatever your color was, you went to the schools.

08:20.438 --> 08:22.339
We didn't have any buses. The buses only went one 
way. It was from your home to the school. And we did,

08:25.792 --> 08:31.823
you know, there was only up until, let's see, there 
was only one high school until the late 50s. I think

08:32.043 --> 08:35.850
57 was probably the first year for South Houston. 
Rayburn didn't come until the 60s. Elementary

08:37.453 --> 08:43.664
schools was in your neighborhood, and they're 
still strong of Asher and Oberlin. That's where

08:45.027 --> 08:45.708
you go. So we've missed out on all the fun. busing, 
riots in the street, those types of things.

08:54.144 --> 09:00.394
Houston didn't have those problems in the early 
days of the turmoil as it were. The blacks in

09:00.414 --> 09:09.228
Houston reported that they had their own 
lifestyles, their own way of life, like the Asians

09:00.414 --> 09:09.228
do now in Houston. And they weren't looking for any 
additional territory. They were entitled to it,

09:12.052 --> 09:15.097
but they weren't really looking for it. So they 
sent blacks in from out of town. I wrote the

09:18.020 --> 09:25.271
headlines in the city, or in the newspapers, was 
that the local blacks met the out-of-town blacks

09:18.020 --> 09:25.271
at the bus station and said, you get back on the bus. 
They said, look, we had some agitation in Houston,

09:25.632 --> 09:37.150
but it was, like I said, that was the only contact 
that I had with it, and this is well into the 60s when

09:25.632 --> 09:37.150
we were separated.

09:37.170 --> 09:41.477
Was Pasadena ever affected by segregation, 
busing, or the civil rights issues? I seem to

09:41.978 --> 09:44.141
anticipate that question. No. I don't think I can 
really elaborate much more than that. I'm sure

09:50.285 --> 09:52.247
that there's an undertone. I know Pasadena has a 
reputation of being a lowly white town.

09:58.776 --> 10:02.241
Supposedly, you didn't, if you were black, you 
didn't stay in Pasadena after dark. South Houston

10:03.262 --> 10:05.526
had a sign over there. There were a thing that said, 
blacks don't let the sun set on you. But South

10:09.511 --> 10:14.638
Houston, when George Christie moved his circus 
there in the late 20s, he said, hey, I've got all

10:14.922 --> 10:17.307
sorts of people working for me. That sign comes 
down, or I don't move in the town. The sign came

10:19.170 --> 10:20.393
down. Now, perhaps the attitude remained, but it 
was sort of an unwritten law. That was the case.

10:27.326 --> 10:30.352
I know even today, blacks feel that way about 
Pasadena. But we've got blacks in the police

10:30.392 --> 10:32.136
department. We've got blacks working in 
businesses all over town.

10:39.948 --> 10:45.814
We're still perceived that way, and I'm sure it 
exists, but it's not on any covert, noticeable

10:39.948 --> 10:45.814
level. We don't talk about it in meetings. Nobody 
makes any jokes about it. It's not the pun or

10:49.758 --> 10:51.400
anything. We talk about Aggies.

10:55.545 --> 11:00.910
Have racial attitudes changed over the four 
generations of the Pomeroy family? I'm sure that

11:02.952 --> 11:08.318
attitudes have changed, and they've changed 
because of enlightenment. If you didn't have

11:08.905 --> 11:12.629
contact with these people, then you couldn't form 
an opinion. And any opinion you had is probably

11:12.649 --> 11:16.033
something you either heard or you read about. As 
you become involved with these people, I think

11:18.435 --> 11:23.461
probably your first reaction is, you know, these 
are strange people. I don't like this. Because

11:24.802 --> 11:27.205
this is an extremely conservative community. 
It's still got very much of worrying roots. We're

11:32.570 --> 11:38.777
still perceived as a redneck type community. But

11:39.331 --> 11:47.178
we've been placed in contact with a few more 
blacks. Our children are going to school with a few

11:47.258 --> 11:51.142
blacks. And these aren't agitation experiences. 
These are just students in the classroom. It's

11:55.526 --> 12:00.691
like when I went to school with the Mexicans, there 
was no agitation. They were decent people. And as

12:02.693 --> 12:08.038
you get to meet more and more, your feelings 
towards them improve, change, accept them more,

12:08.491 --> 12:21.670
and I'm confident that we're much more tolerant, 
much more enlightened than we were back in 1900,

12:08.491 --> 12:21.670
and I'm sure we have a ways to go. Has the Pomeroy 
family ever been involved in the government of

12:24.074 --> 12:29.722
Pasadena? Pomeroy's per se, as Pomeroy's, none. 
The extended family, as I've mentioned earlier,

12:35.339 --> 12:39.784
yes, we were involved. It's sort of like a, you 
know, well, you take care of that area, and we'll

12:39.804 --> 12:47.291
take care of this area of the community. The 
Williams side of the family were involved in

12:47.311 --> 12:53.838
politics with Everett Williams. He was the city 
councilman, the city commissioner at the time,

12:54.318 --> 12:59.464
head of the water department. Clyde McMaster made 
his contribution as mayor for eight years. My

13:03.928 --> 13:04.789
grandfather... When

13:05.157 --> 13:21.234
they were building,

13:05.157 --> 13:21.234
one of the schools here in town, Howard Telps, 
actually senior, the father that Howard Telps and

13:05.157 --> 13:21.234
most of us think of today, was the contractor. He 
was living in the rented room in my grandfather's

13:21.274 --> 13:23.996
house. My grandfather said, gee, one day I'd like 
to be mayor of Pasadena. And Telps wrote a book, and

13:28.481 --> 13:32.245
it's in the book, okay? John was the type of person 
that he wasn't going to stop the politics. He had to

13:37.217 --> 13:40.922
work on his job, and when he got through with his 
job, then he would do his community service. And

13:41.563 --> 13:42.885
the first one was the church. They never quite got 
to government, which is fine. I've been tempted

13:47.611 --> 13:54.981
myself to be involved in government, but I've 
decided there's other areas I can make

13:47.611 --> 13:54.981
contributions. I don't need to... kiss babies and 
shake a lot of hands. How has the women's role in

13:59.986 --> 14:05.091
Pasadena society changed throughout your 
family's history? Well, women have always played

14:06.932 --> 14:14.719
a fairly significant role in the community. With 
the farming beginnings, there was no

14:14.739 --> 14:18.022
differentiation. If you had a pair of hands, you 
were working. You were a husband, you were a wife,

14:20.164 --> 14:22.226
you were children. It didn't make any difference. 
As long as you could hold your diapers up, you went

14:23.848 --> 14:26.430
out and did a job. The first postmaster in Pasadena 
was a male. The second postmaster was female. And

14:34.037 --> 14:39.001
in the first 30 years, the postmaster mistresses 
in Pasadena, most of them were female. The first

14:40.422 --> 14:44.166
one of those was also the first woman attorney. She 
went off, got her education, came back, was an

14:44.586 --> 14:47.128
attorney in town. This is all pre-1930. My 
great-grandmother, Anna Louise Fonroy, was an

14:54.912 --> 14:57.676
agitator type or something, I guess you could say. 
And when Pasadena incorporated in 1924,

14:58.176 --> 15:14.619
decided we needed some city services and stuff, we 
made the mistake of incorporating Houston Light

14:58.176 --> 15:14.619
and Power Facility on the Houston Ship Channel, 
and crowned the final Houston Ship Channel. Well,

15:14.639 --> 15:20.667
this just infuriated Houston, because Houston 
spent all this time promoting a ship channel, and

15:14.639 --> 15:20.667
here's these little towns coming in, grab ahold of 
all this big tax base. So they sued Pasadena. They

15:26.092 --> 15:29.977
got the Secretary of State to turn state attorney 
to sue Pasadena. I don't know what the grounds were

15:31.839 --> 15:33.521
particularly. But anyway, Pasadena got scared 
off and said, OK, well, we can't afford to fight the

15:33.541 --> 15:39.068
big state and the big city. So they backed off and 
incorporated the following year. Houston got to

15:43.132 --> 15:48.679
thinking, well, I bet those rabble-rousers are 
just guessing. Those rabble-rousers are going to

15:49.368 --> 15:50.830
do it again. So why don't we incorporate them? 
They're not incorporating them. Annex them. So

15:56.458 --> 15:59.843
they jumped out and annexed Harrisburg, which is 
between Houston and Pasadena. They started

16:00.524 --> 16:02.387
looking at territory outside of there. And my 
great-grandmother said, no, we don't want to be

16:03.028 --> 16:07.735
part of Houston. We want to be Pasadena. So she 
organized a local community, and they put up a

16:09.398 --> 16:15.587
fight in the end of Houston, called the City 
Council. She went and talked to Sinclair, now

16:16.268 --> 16:19.172
Arco, And they said, no, you know, we agree with 
you. So they provided the attorneys for Pasadena,

16:21.717 --> 16:30.693
and we went into Houston and fought off their 
annexation attempts, and turned right around and

16:21.717 --> 16:30.693
reincorporated. So in 1929, we were incorporated 
as a city, and we've continued as a city since then.

16:38.848 --> 16:42.274
First legal, I'm sorry, first medical profession 
started in Pasadena in 1937. Prior to that, we'd

16:45.189 --> 16:50.995
have a doctor, and when he would die, another 
doctor would come into town, and that type of

16:45.189 --> 16:50.995
thing. In 1937, Dr. Edward Connors moved to 
Pasadena, built a hospital, which was the first

16:51.015 --> 17:04.251
hospital in the area, and started bringing some of 
his buddies in from Oklahoma, where he graduated

16:51.015 --> 17:04.251
from medical school. And it was just like, no 
sooner they got in, they got drafted. So we had

17:08.796 --> 17:11.299
doctors coming in and doctors coming out, And 
somebody had a really great idea and brought in a

17:12.410 --> 17:16.574
lady doctor about 1939. Of course, she didn't get 
drafted. So the first female doctor that passed in

17:20.518 --> 17:23.361
was about 1939. She was here for like about five 
years and then left. And in the chiropractic

17:27.364 --> 17:36.053
profession, I think they had passed in in 1942 and 
two of them were female chiropractors. And one of

17:36.073 --> 17:39.336
them, Dr. Sally Allen, is still here. She's still 
in business. The doctors that were here

17:40.810 --> 17:45.918
originally are now retired, but Sally Allen is 
still a chiropractor. Education, the first, it

17:45.938 --> 18:08.151
was quite a few years before we had a lady on the 
board of education, board of directors or

17:45.938 --> 18:08.151
whatever it is, and I'm not sure we have had any 
females other than that, but in the education

17:45.938 --> 18:08.151
business, they have been involved, of course, as 
teachers, 99%. The early teachers were women. I

18:12.615 --> 18:18.144
said, I think we married half of them in the Palmer 
family. No sooner than the schools got started

18:18.524 --> 18:21.189
than the PTA got started. And passing the PTA or its 
roots is probably Well, it is the oldest civic

18:27.655 --> 18:31.640
organization in the community. And it was formed 
by the ladies. It was run by the ladies. You don't

18:35.085 --> 18:38.529
have a few men, but it's usually the mothers that 
are concerned. It's still a dynamic force shaping

18:38.569 --> 18:42.675
the education of the community. Business-wise, 
they were involved, as I said, equally with men.

18:48.502 --> 18:52.127
There was no real discrimination.

18:53.356 --> 18:57.304
A few of them, although their husbands worked with 
them, it was known as their business. Betty

18:57.324 --> 18:58.786
Mitchell is one example. Her father, Walter 
Williams, started a grocery store and a dry goods.

19:03.034 --> 19:11.230
And his daughter, Betty, married Mr. Mitchell, 
and she ran the store. He opened up another store

19:11.598 --> 19:14.280
and said, no, I'll take it back. No, no, no. It was 
their children that started opening that grocery

19:15.141 --> 19:17.783
store. But she was known as Betty Mitchelson. We 
had several ladies that had clothing stores in

19:20.606 --> 19:23.408
town. So they were fairly visible. They were 
fairly involved. When it came to industry,

19:27.451 --> 19:32.235
however, they were not involved. That was a men's 
business. And it hadn't been until the last 10

19:34.497 --> 19:39.101
years or so that they had really gotten involved. I 
think it's sort of... hysterical or funny or

19:42.158 --> 19:54.517
ironic or something, but I was talking to a savings 
owner, a company president a couple years ago, and

19:42.158 --> 19:54.517
he says, well, we were talking about Pasadena 
having the second highest per household income in

19:42.158 --> 19:54.517
the state of Texas. We've got a strong industry 
base over here. They pay good. There's good

19:58.042 --> 19:59.705
overtime. We've always had a lot of two-member 
family employment. And he'll say, Well, you take

20:06.053 --> 20:08.656
one situation I was dealing with the other day. The 
husband is an insurance salesman. He's making

20:10.819 --> 20:12.000
about $15,000. Now, his wife, she's a welder. She 
works out at Sheff. She makes $25,000 a year. So I'm

20:21.651 --> 20:29.480
sure we've had some domestic problems over the 
wife making more money, but they pretty well carry

20:21.651 --> 20:29.480
their weight. Oh, one more thing was the city 
government We have had several ladies serve on

20:34.032 --> 20:41.328
city council, and we've got a bunch running now. 
They've gotten more and more excited. They're

20:43.733 --> 20:45.317
going to come out of the school system. So it's 
evolving, and I think they, from my perspective,

20:46.559 --> 20:53.374
are getting a good fair share.

20:56.493 --> 21:03.663
Pasadena has changed tremendously over the 
years, but it seems to be impossible in changing

20:56.493 --> 21:03.663
its Wild West image. Is Pasadena really the Wild 
West? Well, no, we're east of Houston, actually.

21:12.715 --> 21:13.757
Maybe we're the Wild East. Now, Pasadena has the 
image from our local major entertainment

21:15.519 --> 21:25.453
attraction, which is Gillies.

21:26.058 --> 21:33.888
And Mickey Gilear, when he's on national TV, and 
they say, and Mickey Gilear from Houston, he says,

21:26.058 --> 21:33.888
no, I'm from Pasadena. He's proud of it, which is a 
blessing on one side and a problem on the other

21:33.908 --> 21:39.856
side. Because no place else on national TV does 
someone stand up as a conductor of a symphony, as a

21:39.876 --> 21:52.993
movie star, as a president of the United States, 
and say, I'm from Pasadena. So the image

21:53.243 --> 21:58.350
nationally people have of Pasadena is Gillies. 
It's just marketing. They know how to market their

21:59.732 --> 22:04.077
product, and the rest of the community hasn't 
marketed its product. As I like to point out, maybe

22:04.097 --> 22:09.564
2,000, maybe 5,000 people in Pasadena go to 
Gillies. There's 120 other thousand people in

22:10.926 --> 22:13.890
Pasadena. What do they do? More of them go to 
church, but nationally we're not going for our

22:16.794 --> 22:20.719
churches. More of them go to school. We've got a 
good reputation. We have much less that go to our

22:26.003 --> 22:32.930
new Philharmonic Orchestra, but we're hoping to 
build that. We've had a little theater that's been

22:34.091 --> 22:40.658
in existence long before Gillies, but they 
haven't been able to market themselves as well. So

22:40.678 --> 22:49.947
you only have maybe 1,000 people that have ever 
gone to a little theater versus the 2,000 a weekend

22:40.678 --> 22:49.947
that goes to Gillies.

22:52.492 --> 22:59.580
One of the things that people point to as our Wally 
West image is our alter ego horses, our pickup

22:52.492 --> 22:59.580
trucks. Well, we've got pickup trucks. You're 
right about that. But we don't have horses in the

23:02.683 --> 23:05.226
back of our pickup trucks. What we've got is we've 
got welding equipment. We've got construction

23:08.129 --> 23:10.071
tools. We've got a trailer hitch we put our boat on 
or mulch for our gardens. There's a lot of things we

23:18.540 --> 23:22.144
use our pickup trucks for. I would be surprised if 
the average in Pasadena is not a two-car family.

23:26.859 --> 23:28.601
Maybe a three-car family. And the wife, as is 
typical, has the nice sedan or maybe the station

23:28.621 --> 23:36.309
wagon because she holds the children with her. And 
then the husband, because he goes into industry,

23:36.329 --> 23:39.332
well, there's two things. You don't take a nice car 
out of the industry because, you know, the

23:39.352 --> 23:44.137
chemicals from the air were rusted on the spot. So 
you take a work vehicle. And that works not only to

23:46.930 --> 23:50.473
get you there, but also puts you around the house. 
Because we're a lot of do-it-ourselvers around

23:50.493 --> 23:53.576
here. Do-it-yourself is very good. I finally had 
to borrow a trailer. I don't have a pickup truck,

23:58.440 --> 24:01.363
but I need to haul things around. So we've got that 
problem, yes. And it's a matter, we've got to work

24:02.604 --> 24:12.672
on promoting the community, the family time, the 
churches, the education, the residential areas.

24:12.752 --> 24:15.955
People are amazed, constantly, at the 
residential areas in Pasadena. If you go into Deer

24:17.238 --> 24:27.949
Park, and you go down to Clear Lake, and you go to 
some of the other areas, you've got a lot of major

24:17.238 --> 24:27.949
tract builders, U.S. owned general homes, 
violence, and all of those, which are basically

24:17.238 --> 24:27.949
Cooke's Cove type homes. Pasadena, you have 
tremendous amount of custom built homes. You've

24:31.533 --> 24:35.197
got a few local builders, and they build only in the 
Pasadena market. There's not that, they don't use

24:35.237 --> 24:39.401
a total of 10 home plans. You probably have 2,000 
different home styles out of the 10,000 homes we

24:39.541 --> 24:46.148
have in Pasadena. Newer areas are just a collage of 
architectural styles. You don't have a

24:53.552 --> 24:55.234
subdivision of Cape Cod. You've got a street 
that's got a pictorial, and a Cape Cod, and a

24:55.254 --> 25:03.002
colonial, and a modern, and a you name it, it's 
there. We even have long cabins in Pasadena.

25:09.250 --> 25:13.554
You've got an image of being a redneck, a hard hat, a 
long neck community. Well, we do. Pittsburgh does

25:15.457 --> 25:16.658
too. I was listening to a news report the other day, 
and they said, yeah, Pittsburgh was all upset

25:16.992 --> 25:23.019
about being called a redneck city. Redneck is, you 
know, you started out with the little sun on your

25:23.640 --> 25:28.526
neck because you worked outside. Most of the 
people in Pasadena, well, take that back. The last

25:32.430 --> 25:46.307
couple of years, the last couple of decades, the 
census report shows that outside construction,

25:32.430 --> 25:46.307
manual labor is a significantly small, is an 
insignificantly small. Well, however it works,

25:46.692 --> 25:50.077
it's a small number. Most of our people are 
managers out in the plants. We've got so much

25:53.703 --> 25:58.671
automation, most everybody's a supervisor or 
manager. And they're pulling down $35,000,

25:58.691 --> 26:05.221
$50,000, $65,000 a year. We've got the largest 
single employer within the state of New Mexico,

26:05.241 --> 26:10.228
and it's the school district. Second largest, I 
think, is in the conversation.

26:16.190 --> 26:17.452
Maybe through the government. The shift from a 
redneck to a person who's unwilling to change and

26:20.015 --> 26:31.970
accept new ideas, I think it's basically unfair on 
the community. I don't see ourselves as not being

26:32.350 --> 26:38.478
open to change and being stuck in the old dog-run 
past. The average age in Pasadena is about 27. So

26:41.122 --> 26:45.387
that means that you've got a lot of young people in 
the community. And they're open, one with

26:45.518 --> 26:49.581
television, one with, I think everyone in high 
school now has a car. Mobility in the community, I

26:51.183 --> 26:56.908
think it's an unfair label for the community. I 
think our biggest problem is that we're not

26:56.928 --> 27:05.555
marketing what we have, both to people in the 
community, so they're proud of their community,

26:56.928 --> 27:05.555
and to people outside. We've invited lately some 
of the media in the community to say, hey, let's

27:05.615 --> 27:15.103
show you things that you're not running in town 
filming and leaving, because the KKK are meeting,

27:05.615 --> 27:15.103
or city governments handed this big squabble, or a 
big narcotics fight. So let's show you some of the

27:20.158 --> 27:31.812
things about what really is the essence, what we 
feel the essence of.

27:31.832 --> 27:38.139
What has been your role in improving Pasadena's 
cultural image?

27:38.159 --> 27:43.926
Well, I can characterize my participation, I 
guess, in two different ways. I was introduced a

27:45.610 --> 27:52.138
while back at a speech I was giving on medical 
history in Pasadena. Dr. Parker Williams, the

27:52.158 --> 28:00.469
president of St. Justin College South, got up 
there and said, I'd like to introduce David

27:52.158 --> 28:00.469
Pommoy, a has-been. He has been, I think, 
everything. My wife, on the other hand,

28:03.633 --> 28:10.442
characterizes me half-jokingly and very 
seriously as a civic junkie. I just can't say no.

28:12.610 --> 28:19.180
And if someone says, gee, David, I think what we 
need in Pasadena is this and such, key words, need

28:12.610 --> 28:19.180
in Pasadena. I'll say, right, and here, I'll do 
this. So I've suffered from the inability to say

28:23.346 --> 28:32.359
no, and it has gotten me into a fair amount of 
trouble. I've been involved in promoting what I

28:32.379 --> 28:41.773
call the hometown image of Pasadena. As I had said 
earlier, so many people came to Pasadena, I'm

28:42.226 --> 28:47.173
going to make the money, I'm going to leave, but 
they're still here. In fact, I've talked to

28:47.734 --> 28:52.901
numerous ones of the third generation, that 
that's what they were going to do. Come and go, and

28:53.422 --> 28:59.551
now they have children, and their children are now 
in Pasadena growing up. And when I say, well, you

28:59.571 --> 29:02.435
know, did I mention some historical fact? Well, 
they had no idea. So I decided, for whatever

29:04.398 --> 29:11.929
reason, that promoting the history of the 
community pull out the facts and say, hey, this is

29:12.398 --> 29:16.081
something to be proud of. This is our roots. You 
know, this is where we started over here was an

29:17.403 --> 29:21.947
artesian well, and there was nothing over here at 
all. And what the community is, is what the people

29:22.507 --> 29:25.310
have made it today. We're sort of in a, you're 
running down the highway, you've got lead

29:26.311 --> 29:37.321
vehicle, you've got rear vehicle, you're in the 
middle, you call the rocket ship. Well, we're sort

29:37.341 --> 29:38.662
of in the rocket ship. We've got Houston, And when 
you think of a historical community,

29:41.440 --> 29:46.346
Williamsburg or something like that, they're 
hundreds of years old. Galveston is almost 200

29:46.406 --> 29:49.330
years old. And they have grown up, and they got to a 
point, and they started appreciating their

29:50.091 --> 29:56.158
history, and they started developing their 
culture. And then they've gone through another

29:56.999 --> 29:59.382
generation of that. When Pasadena, 1895, 
started, we didn't really get going until 1937.

30:05.550 --> 30:07.492
We've just really started. We haven't built the 
historical structures in this community We're

30:11.360 --> 30:12.742
built in Williamsburg. We're built in Houston. 
Houston is 100 years old. The houses that you see,

30:15.486 --> 30:17.449
they're preserving. We're built. We haven't 
gotten to that point. You look at their evolution,

30:20.294 --> 30:28.406
and you go through survival, and when you get into 
the next generation, then they want something a

30:20.294 --> 30:28.406
little bit better. Capacity has just now gotten to 
that point. And I'm trying to say, okay, we've gone

30:31.671 --> 30:33.734
through that cycle. Look at our history. Take some 
pride in where we've come from. And we're also now

30:37.340 --> 30:40.084
ready to take a little more responsibility toward 
that. quality of life in our community. Our own

30:41.954 --> 30:48.244
cultural, entertainment, social needs need to be 
satisfied within the community. No longer are we

30:48.264 --> 30:50.748
going to Houston for that good restaurant. 
Because I take my wife out a couple times a week. I

30:53.132 --> 30:54.174
don't want to go to Houston. I want to go to 
Pasadena. And I don't want to eat at the same

30:55.456 --> 30:57.439
hamburger place every time. So I'm pleased to see 
that we're beginning to do it. On the historical

31:04.010 --> 31:15.180
side, I got involved in the Historical Society and 
helped set up the historical collection that

31:04.010 --> 31:15.180
passed in the public library so that that material 
is available for the public to come in and look at.

31:16.121 --> 31:23.348
Here to fall, if the school should assign to their 
students, you know, do a history paper, there was

31:16.121 --> 31:23.348
no place for them to go. They might go interview 
someone they'd heard about, but that was the

31:23.368 --> 31:26.110
extent of it. There was no places they could look at 
pictures, they could listen to history tapes,

31:26.130 --> 31:33.797
which we haven't done yet, by the way, but we're 
going to. There was no access to this material.

31:36.485 --> 31:43.693
Also, the early historical materials that were 
collected, like I said, there's a palm oil

31:36.485 --> 31:43.693
collection that I had. There was a historical 
society. There was an early settlers

31:45.716 --> 31:50.281
association, which I'm also a member of, 
collection. And then there was another

31:50.622 --> 31:52.724
collection over here. And they each kept them 
private unto themselves because, you know, I

31:53.084 --> 31:57.790
don't like someone's out there in that other 
group. And I might as well let them look at my stuff.

32:00.353 --> 32:04.678
So by moving to the library, we had created a 
neutral territory. The historical collection

32:04.861 --> 32:08.847
there in the two years it's existed has quadrupled 
in size. If I can ever get mine organized, I'm going

32:09.788 --> 32:14.795
to get mine over there too. But I've been involved 
in the historical thing. I'm culturally

32:16.558 --> 32:18.500
involved. I'm through the chamber on the Cultural 
Affairs Committee. I was one of the original

32:22.827 --> 32:28.995
directors for passing a program on it, which then 
became a member of the Cultural Affairs

32:22.827 --> 32:28.995
Committee. The Cultural Affairs Committee was 
the first pulling together of the various

32:29.015 --> 32:34.463
culturally oriented activities in the 
community. We have Pasadena Art League is a

32:35.952 --> 32:51.572
member, we have the Pasadena City Jazz Ballet is a 
member, the Pasadena Philharmonic, Pasadena

32:35.952 --> 32:51.572
Little Theater, there's several other groups, I 
can't remember the names, that are involved. And

32:51.592 --> 32:53.735
now we've got such a place for us to talk about. This 
is where the Little Theater tells the

32:53.815 --> 33:00.163
Philharmonic, you know, well gee, we've been here 
a long time, but we don't have the support you've

33:00.363 --> 33:03.508
got, would you help us build our membership? So we 
can work back and forth with each other. As an

33:06.412 --> 33:24.480
outgrowth of that, we're in the process of 
forming, we're not sure what we're going to call

33:06.412 --> 33:24.480
it, but it'll be something like the Pasadena 
Cultural Arts Council, which will be a non-profit

33:06.412 --> 33:24.480
organization so you can make donations and take it 
as a tax deduction, where we can funnel, we can hire

33:06.412 --> 33:24.480
full-time coordinator so that it's not going to 
have to depend upon volunteers, that there's a

33:25.068 --> 33:34.656
central place that you can call to get program 
information, ticket information, this type of

33:25.068 --> 33:34.656
thing. Pasadena Little Theater just recently 
lost their structure for theaters on fire. And so

33:41.823 --> 33:44.205
they're looking for a new place. And we said, well, 
look, if you're going to look for a new place, why

33:44.225 --> 33:51.231
don't you get something large enough to 
accommodate some of these other activities that

33:44.225 --> 33:51.231
take. Philharmonic needs a place. The Art League 
needs a place to show their stuff. So we decided we

33:58.720 --> 34:03.127
would try to find some sort of cultural center that 
we could come up with. And one of the other hats I

34:03.147 --> 34:13.502
wear, one of the other groups involved in the 
Cultural Affairs Committee is the Historical

34:03.147 --> 34:13.502
Society. And they said, hey, let's save some 
historical building and what can we use? And

34:17.568 --> 34:21.433
someone came up with, well, it's not that old. The 
Capitan Theater is one of the last of the Art Deco

34:24.434 --> 34:30.841
brand movie theaters left. It was built right at 
the end. The guy that built it wasn't reading his

34:32.823 --> 34:37.829
paper, and he didn't know the television was 
coming. And he put all this money into a really nice

34:37.849 --> 34:45.137
place, really, as far as Pasadena, boy, it's one of 
the outstanding architectural structures. So we

34:45.657 --> 34:54.407
thought, well, let's put together all these 
various interests and see if we can acquire that

34:45.657 --> 34:54.407
structure, renovate it, bring it back to its 
former glory, and provide it with a home for all

34:54.877 --> 34:56.018
these various groups. We can also attract in a 
group from the Texas Ballet Group. I forgot their

35:01.744 --> 35:07.409
full name, but anyway, they're an accredited 
state ballet group out of Deer Park. And have them

35:07.429 --> 35:09.951
in there, because they're looking for a place. And 
there's several musical groups down in Clear

35:09.971 --> 35:12.734
Lake. I'm sure that if we could provide them with a 
home, we'd then concentrate it and provide a

35:13.455 --> 35:21.222
central source for the local community to go. And 
it's got all this great attributes, easy access,

35:21.421 --> 35:26.088
existing structure, bringing us identity. And we 
can go after historical funds, cultural funds.

35:29.854 --> 35:30.955
They're all over the place. And then we can start 
programs where school children can go and

35:31.436 --> 35:47.240
participate in a full philharmonic and get 
musical appreciation on a formal level,

35:31.436 --> 35:47.240
teaching.

35:47.260 --> 35:49.183
I buy some artwork from some local dealers.

35:53.028 --> 35:53.969
those types of things. One other,

35:56.232 --> 36:03.040
I don't know, cultural, let me expand it slightly. 
Again, I mentioned quality of life in the

36:03.541 --> 36:07.766
community. Tom was involved. My wife is currently 
in retirement, but was the original director of

36:09.509 --> 36:18.059
the Pasadena Beautification Commission. And 
Pasadena is in great need of beautification. I

36:21.644 --> 36:22.765
think that adds to the community's image, quality 
of life, and cultural appreciation. Because if

36:27.881 --> 36:35.522
you live in a Japanese city, it's really hard to sit 
there and appreciate something, take pride in it.

36:42.505 --> 36:54.038
Looking back over the four generations of the 
Pomeroy family, how is your life different than

36:42.505 --> 36:54.038
that of your ancestors, and do you have the impact 
on Pasadena that they once had? Well, I move a lot

36:56.180 --> 37:01.906
faster than my ancestors. They didn't have a lot of 
places to run around. They didn't have a car. I got

37:07.072 --> 37:07.973
that. I don't know if I have more of an antithyroid 
than they did or not. But there's more things to get

37:13.966 --> 37:19.194
involved in. But on the other hand, the impact I can 
have on this community, even if I dedicated 150% of

37:19.214 --> 37:27.227
my time to it, would be much less than the impact 
that my ancestors had on the community simply

37:27.562 --> 37:34.248
because of the numbers of people involved. They 
were one family out of 16, max one out of six. So the

37:39.133 --> 37:45.019
numbers there, if you did something, you affected 
quite a bit of people. In Pasadena, if I'm elected

37:45.039 --> 37:52.426
to be chairman of another committee, that's not 
going to affect a lot of people. I think

37:52.446 --> 37:54.868
personally, though, that I been instrumental in a 
lot of things that are, I guess you'd say subtle,

37:55.220 --> 38:03.754
that will have long-range implications on the 
community. I've been involved very much in

38:03.774 --> 38:13.771
beautification, not only through my wife, with 
her involvement, but also personally in some of

38:03.774 --> 38:13.771
the things that I have done, been involved in 
historically. But I think that I, and I'll take

38:13.791 --> 38:16.536
credit, I think I've gotten it out of the old 
blue-haired lady tennis shoe syndrome into

38:17.258 --> 38:27.069
something now a little more public and with a lot 
broader support. I'd like a few more members, but

38:27.089 --> 38:31.134
anyway, people are more aware of the history. 
We've got more things published.

38:36.540 --> 38:39.283
I'm not involved in the educational aspect 
because I don't have children involved in the

38:39.533 --> 38:42.738
school district. Then they only had a couple of 
choices. There was work, church, and school. Work

38:50.309 --> 38:55.297
was during the day, and church was on Sunday, and 
the evenings was for school. My grandfather was

38:56.358 --> 39:02.167
also a member of the Pasadena Literary Society, as 
was my great-grandfather. He obviously had a book

39:02.187 --> 39:04.891
reading club or something back then. I don't have 
time for that. I'm sure we have that or a survivor

39:06.173 --> 39:09.017
organization. I'm involved in many more things 
than they were, but there are many more things to

39:09.605 --> 39:18.094
do.

39:18.114 --> 39:26.564
I hope that my involvement has some influence on 
the direction of the community because I feel

39:18.114 --> 39:26.564
strongly about where I would like to see the 
community go. I feel also that anyone living in a

39:26.584 --> 39:33.752
community has an obligation to it. So I'm doing 
what I think to be my obligation.

39:41.802 --> 39:52.833
Was there, did I, did I answer the question or is 
there a little more, did I get a feel from something

39:41.802 --> 39:52.833
like that, the thrust on it? Well, I guess, let me 
say, life has changed from a very slow, easygoing,

39:52.853 --> 40:02.623
hand-to-mouth type. This is the way it's changed 
everywhere. We have put to bed the strawberries.

40:09.529 --> 40:10.210
Literally. Literally. The only strawberry 
gardens that exist now are strawberry farms and

40:11.637 --> 40:18.908
strawberry pots and people's back patios.

40:21.111 --> 40:23.535
And it's going to keep growing. Pasadena has not an 
unlimited future. You've got Houston on one side,

40:30.638 --> 40:38.387
you've got Galveston Bay on the other, and you have 
Houston on the south side with a clear lake. So

40:38.407 --> 40:42.773
we're locked into our maximum expansion. We're 
now at 125. The most people that I project that

40:44.074 --> 40:53.085
Pasadena can ever have is with reasonable 
density, unless we go to Apartment City. It's

40:53.406 --> 40:56.489
about 225, maybe 250,000 people. So we're halfway 
there. And probably, with commercial

41:00.119 --> 41:06.407
developments in the area, we're going to hit maybe 
200,000. That's it. So I think our challenge today

41:08.130 --> 41:20.406
is not survival and setting up basic 
institutions, but is to pick and choose among the

41:08.130 --> 41:20.406
thousands that are available. that to find those 
that best represent what we want our community to

41:20.808 --> 41:26.737
be in the future. Because now is the time to work on 
it. If we want to be strictly a bedroom community,

41:29.200 --> 41:32.826
build bunches of houses. If we want to be a 
self-contained community, and really 200,000 is

41:33.286 --> 41:39.015
too much for one self-contained town. You're 
really talking maybe 50,000 ought to be a

41:39.395 --> 41:43.080
self-contained unit. So we've gone beyond that. 
But if we want to be a self-contained town, It

41:46.576 --> 41:53.507
provides employment base, which is like 
entertainment, recreation, retail, medical,

41:46.576 --> 41:53.507
all of those types of things. And we have to focus in 
on that type of thing because we don't have that

41:53.907 --> 41:57.693
much land left. We've got more of a mix racially in 
the community. We will have a mix. We've got to

42:06.627 --> 42:08.169
address those issues. We've avoided the issue of 
transportation in our community. which has, I'm

42:12.665 --> 42:21.645
sure, contributed to the fact that we haven't had 
more non-whites in the community. We've got to

42:21.912 --> 42:24.915
address that because the community is going to 
need it. Energy is going to be required. Traffic is

42:27.237 --> 42:28.839
going to be required. We're very fortunate in 
being able to get around in the community with the

42:28.859 --> 42:33.663
ease that we do. But it still takes 15 to 20 minutes 
to get to our house. And for the distance involved,

42:37.607 --> 42:44.894
that takes a little bit of time. I think we've taken 
charge. I said earlier that we were a

42:46.135 --> 42:49.438
do-it-yourself. We're also do-it-yourself,

42:49.688 --> 43:07.427
many other things, and maybe that's the character 
of Pasadena that makes it very positive, is that

42:49.688 --> 43:07.427
we've realized that we've got a crime problem, as 
every other city has. got involved and said, okay,

43:09.010 --> 43:12.556
let's do something about it. I was involved with 
the original Hawaiian Prevention Council, I'm

43:12.576 --> 43:17.205
pleased to say. I did not put anywhere near the 
amount of work that a couple dozen people had

43:17.786 --> 43:25.339
really made that thing exist. We now have a 
neighborhood watch program. And there's some

43:27.844 --> 43:32.031
people involved that have dedicated their lives 
to that one area. And they have done a superb job as

43:32.011 --> 43:40.224
far as impacting upon the quality of the life of our 
community, because we are a very safe community.

43:40.244 --> 43:42.508
In Houston, there's a crime prevented. Why most 
times it goes unrecorded, there's an irons in the

43:44.751 --> 43:48.257
crime. And the police on a good day, weekday,

43:55.771 --> 43:58.177
during the day, not the week, weekends don't 
count. There's no relationship weekends. It

44:01.063 --> 44:03.128
takes a minimum of 30 minutes to get to you. That's 
after they have answered the call with you being on

44:03.148 --> 44:07.097
hold for 15. in Pasadena, five max 10 minutes there 
at your door. And that's Monday, Tuesday,

44:12.095 --> 44:15.122
Wednesday, Friday, Saturday night. Doesn't make 
any difference. If you used to go on Saturday

44:16.866 --> 44:26.048
night, and they sure did, and bleeding right 
there, and I suspect unless the camera crews are

44:16.866 --> 44:26.048
there, it'll take them a while to get to you. I live 
in a totally different world than my ancestors. I

44:33.821 --> 44:34.943
can see that in my father. There are things going on 
out there that I just assume stay where I am, but not

44:35.925 --> 44:40.875
get involved. And that's why they have got He has 
not really gotten involved, he's just sort of

44:44.337 --> 44:47.281
faded out. Because the city's moving too fast for 
him. He's got his businesses. Palmory's more well

44:51.247 --> 44:55.774
now, Palmory Drilling, which is really fun with a 
lot of gas. Our businesses are outside the

44:56.596 --> 44:59.119
community. We don't sell a product in the 
community. We don't solicit business from the

45:01.223 --> 45:03.907
community. This is our home. We're proud of it. 
We're trying to make it a community that we can live

45:05.469 --> 45:11.458
in, play in, shop in.

45:14.206 --> 45:25.386
So

45:14.206 --> 45:25.386
the cultural movement within the last couple of 
years has been another thing where people say,

45:14.206 --> 45:25.386
hey, this is a need. One person, Rick Undersea, has 
said, hey, I'm going to fill up. We found some more

45:28.792 --> 45:29.754
people. He took the lead. He's doing it himself. 
We're beginning to sort of take charge. I'm glad to

45:35.230 --> 45:36.592
see that. I don't know what our voting 
participation has been. I'd like to see a little

45:40.777 --> 45:42.038
more of that. But at least on an individual basis, 
more and more people are beginning to say, hey,

45:42.299 --> 45:47.245
this is my community. I'm going to do something 
about it. Thank you very much. Oh, I can go on

45:51.950 --> 45:53.372
forever. Thank you.
