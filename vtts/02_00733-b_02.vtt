00:02.393 --> 00:22.727
First, Mr. Jenkins, would you tell us something 
about your early life, including the names of your

00:02.393 --> 00:22.727
parents, when and where they were born and when and 
where they died, when you were born, and what

00:02.393 --> 00:22.727
schools you attended before you went to Texas A&M? 
My father, A.G. Jenkins, was born in Tennessee. He

00:29.360 --> 00:38.951
came to Texas in 1855 and settled in Burleson 
County, right across the river there from College

00:29.360 --> 00:38.951
Station.

00:41.353 --> 00:48.121
He was a veteran of the Civil War, Confederate 
veteran. I can explain that. There's very few

00:49.803 --> 00:56.871
people living now whose father was in the 
Confederate Army, but he was. And the reason that I

00:59.954 --> 01:09.667
explained that was, his first wife died and then he 
married again and he married my mother who was 20

00:59.954 --> 01:09.667
years younger. And then I was the youngest child of 
his second family. When he got out, I like to tell

01:16.677 --> 01:21.583
this about him, he was quite a pioneer. When he got 
out of the service, he was captured at Siege of

01:21.603 --> 01:26.670
Vicksburg. He was captured at Vicksburg and sent 
to prison at Rock Island, Illinois. When he got

01:34.505 --> 01:51.242
back to Burleson County, in 68, he and some other 
former Confederate boys got a bunch of cattle,

01:34.505 --> 01:51.242
two-year-old steers. Drove them to California 
and sold them as four-year-old steers. Two years

01:54.666 --> 01:55.847
on the range. a great man he was. My mother was born 
there in Grosvenor. And I was born in Caldwell in

02:03.152 --> 02:06.497
1895. Your mother's name was what now? Mary, Mary 
King. Mary King. Mary King. And what about the

02:14.929 --> 02:20.898
dates of your mother's birth? Yes, my mother was 
born in, my father was born in I was 45, and my mother

02:25.915 --> 02:30.240
was born in 65. And my father died in 1917, the year I 
was a senior at A&M, and my mother died in 1922.

02:42.172 --> 02:44.454
Were you born in Caldwell? In Caldwell. And you 
went to the public schools there? That's right.

02:50.481 --> 02:55.686
What factors were involved in your choice of A&M as 
a college?

02:58.062 --> 03:05.414
I was seeking an agricultural course, and that 
close by, and was familiar with the school. I take

03:07.017 --> 03:08.820
it you'd been there several times. Oh yes, been on 
the Model T. We traveled to Baltimore on Friday. I

03:13.047 --> 03:14.850
finished high school in 1913. And that would be the 
football games that you went to?

03:22.684 --> 03:23.445
Yeah. What procedures did you go through to be 
admitted to the school? Did you have to take a test

03:28.691 --> 03:30.376
of some sort? No, our high school was affiliated 
with it. We didn't have to take any tests. You just

03:35.589 --> 03:37.334
appeared there and enrolled. Did you have to apply 
and be accepted as you do today? Yes, I guess so.

03:43.871 --> 03:48.459
Yeah, we went over there two or three days before 
the deadline. Well, what I'm getting at is today

03:48.820 --> 03:59.158
kids apply for admission to the school months and 
months before and then they get a letter saying

03:48.820 --> 03:59.158
you've been accepted. No, we just went in there and 
signed up. That was it. This may be a little bit

04:05.849 --> 04:17.402
immaterial since you were somewhat familiar with 
the campus, but what was your immediate reaction

04:05.849 --> 04:17.402
when you were enrolled and settled into school at 
A&M? Well, I was very proud of it. I was very much

04:23.108 --> 04:26.312
impressed with the military. I think back in those 
days, I think a student got as much or more benefit,

04:30.217 --> 04:39.486
if I'll use the word correctly, from his military 
as he did from his academic. The military back when

04:39.526 --> 04:54.501
I was there, they were right on a par with West Point 
in military training, military discipline. We

04:54.521 --> 04:59.886
walked the post and mounted the guard every 
morning. and it was supervised by West Point

05:00.929 --> 05:10.866
officers and they really cracked the meat of West 
Point out of it. You couldn't get out of your room at

05:11.487 --> 05:13.050
night. You had to stay in your room and study. You 
had to march to all the meals. You had to make

05:17.477 --> 05:18.739
revelry. So you would say then the military kind of 
taught you regularity in in a way that a civilian

05:26.883 --> 05:29.546
school could not have done. Oh yes, I think the 
military was, the strict military was a wonderful

05:30.206 --> 05:37.434
thing. Any boy that could take it, a lot of them 
would drop out like they do out of West Point now.

05:45.201 --> 05:51.928
Would you say more of them dropped out because they 
couldn't take the military than because they

05:45.201 --> 05:51.928
couldn't pass the grades? No, I guess I wouldn't 
know. Some of both. That's right. There wasn't too

05:57.873 --> 06:09.225
many dropped out, but I do know that they resented 
hazing, and some of them couldn't take the hazing,

05:57.873 --> 06:09.225
and some of them didn't like the military, 
different things. Could you describe, say, a

06:11.450 --> 06:34.112
typical day during the years that you were there, 
including the time you got up and the procedure for

06:11.450 --> 06:34.112
getting up, the hours you spent in class, the time 
you spent doing other things, such as drilling or

06:11.450 --> 06:34.112
sports or something, and then the procedure of 
going to bed? Reveille blew it around 6 o'clock in

06:34.172 --> 06:39.517
the morning. One time it was dark. You had five 
minutes to get your clothes on and get out in front

06:42.010 --> 06:52.021
of the barracks and a Reveille call. Roll was 
called. And we'd have calisthenics at Reveille.

07:01.651 --> 07:02.211
For how long? Short time, maybe 15 minutes or less. 
And then we'd go back up to our rooms and clean up our

07:06.698 --> 07:13.885
rooms, police our rooms for inspection. And then 
we would first call for breakfast. Maybe it's 45

07:19.109 --> 07:23.313
minutes or something after we got up there. And we 
went down and formed in formation again for

07:23.333 --> 07:26.516
breakfast. And watched the breakfast. And while 
we had breakfast, our rooms were inspected. You

07:37.934 --> 07:41.097
had pretty much of an assigned seat at breakfast or 
at all meals? Yes, we were in a company there. We'd

07:43.880 --> 07:53.510
march in there as a company, and that company would 
sit together in Speezer Hall.

07:53.530 --> 07:59.176
Then after breakfast, why, those classes started 
at 8. Did your companies reform after breakfast?

08:01.118 --> 08:01.178
No. No, we didn't reform. As we got through eating, 
we'd go back to dormitory, and then the first call

08:07.010 --> 08:15.661
for classes, all this was done with a bugle. First 
call to classes, if you had an eight o'clock class,

08:15.681 --> 08:20.687
I'd report to class. Then you had four hours of 
class in the morning, go back at noon, and then

08:20.707 --> 08:31.261
the... By back, you mean to your dormitory? Back to 
your dormitory. Then the... a mess call for noon

08:36.963 --> 08:40.427
meal. And you formed a formation again and marched 
into Springsville Hall. And after that, well,

08:49.379 --> 09:02.015
you'd go back and then you'd have your laboratory 
cases in the afternoon.

09:02.035 --> 09:04.658
So then we drilled, we had drilled three times a 
week. I'd say it was from about 4.30 to 5.30, I'd

09:09.561 --> 09:17.749
tell on the drill field. And then we'd get back, 
wash up, and

09:17.769 --> 09:29.201
it wouldn't be long before it'd be the mess call for 
supper. And then we'd formation again, march to

09:29.221 --> 09:33.565
supper. After supper we had maybe an hour before 
cold quarters. And then we went to our rooms. This

09:48.531 --> 09:52.517
guard that was mounted in the morning, they'd 
mount a guard every morning. A student with a

09:52.537 --> 09:55.181
guard. Why, they would, for three hours there, 
during study period at night, They kept, they'd

10:04.274 --> 10:19.118
march around the barracks, around the hall, and 
you were not disposed to go anywhere out of your

10:04.274 --> 10:19.118
room except you could go from your room to the 
latrine and back to your room. You couldn't visit

10:19.138 --> 10:21.121
from one room to the other. And the guard was, if he 
didn't enforce that, well then he was subject to

10:23.084 --> 10:29.995
severe penalty, punishment. And they did for him, 
they did support him. So then we had, after we, then

10:32.641 --> 10:42.450
they'd blow a release at, I guess it was 10 o'clock. 
And at 10.15 or 10.30, whichever it was, well then

10:42.470 --> 10:48.476
they would sound taps. And after the sounding of 
taps, all lights had to be out within five minutes,

10:50.457 --> 10:57.384
with the exception of the seniors. Seniors could 
burn their lights at midnight.

11:04.400 --> 11:11.447
When did you find out whether or not your room 
passed inspection for the day, or how did you find

11:04.400 --> 11:11.447
out? You'd find it out that evening at the evening 
meal. They read out what is known as a RAM list, and

11:15.871 --> 11:33.208
they'd go right down the line of any RAMs while 
they'd read them out, starting with A's, Abbott

11:15.871 --> 11:33.208
so-and-so, improper dress, Maybe Abbott was room 
not in order. And each one of those carried a

11:39.606 --> 11:41.868
certain number of demerits. And so you would 
always listen at the evening meal to see if your

11:43.169 --> 11:49.635
name was on the ram list. If you got a certain number 
of rams, you could get them off by walking the

11:49.655 --> 11:58.763
bullpen with your rifle.

11:59.844 --> 12:03.567
So many hours, so many rams, and so many hours to 
take off. And you had to hold these rams down,

12:04.508 --> 12:11.817
because if you got too many rams, you were 
expelled. And the way to keep from getting

12:11.837 --> 12:17.244
expelled was walk the bullring and get them off.

12:21.929 --> 12:26.375
What was the food like in the mess hall? Did you have 
many complaints about it? Oh, I guess not. The

12:30.240 --> 12:32.102
table manners were bad. The hard part of the meal 
was on Thursday night we always got steaks. That

12:38.790 --> 12:43.034
was a big deal, Thursday night. And was it, did you 
have a lot of variety or? The meal was all right. Old

12:47.418 --> 12:51.122
man Speezer was a Spaniard. That hall was named 
after him, Old Speezer. He was the

12:54.084 --> 13:00.850
head, what do you call him, head of the- Stewart, I 
believe. Stewart, I guess. Called for a long time.

13:03.183 --> 13:10.415
And we didn't have

13:03.183 --> 13:10.415
cadet waiters. He employed a bunch of Mexican 
boys. He had Mexican waiters.

13:19.451 --> 13:20.753
All four years I was there. I'm interested to hear 
you say that, because I was about to ask you about

13:22.302 --> 13:32.255
students, if there were any students who worked in 
the mess hall as they have been for later on. Oh, I'm

13:32.476 --> 13:34.899
sure, yes, I know they did. What was life like in the 
dormitory where you lived? I know you said at night

13:40.486 --> 13:47.736
they posted a guard, but what about during the day 
if If students who were not in class, did they go

13:48.053 --> 13:53.978
back to their dormitory rooms, or was everybody in 
class from 8 till 12? Well, no, no. You'd have hours

13:55.159 --> 13:58.322
off like you did in high school. Go wherever you 
want to during the day if you weren't in class.

14:05.609 --> 14:09.532
What kind of furniture did you have in your 
dormitory? Oh, we had a table, two beds, two

14:09.552 --> 14:16.238
chairs,

14:20.842 --> 14:26.388
A lot of us, we'd always go down to the secondhand 
store and buy us an old dresser. We wanted

14:26.408 --> 14:27.329
something extra. I went to the secondhand store 
and got me a dresser that I kept for four years. Left

14:33.915 --> 14:35.797
it down there, I guess. Somebody else left it. What 
dormitories did you live in? I was three years on

14:40.462 --> 14:46.929
the top floor of Leggett Hall, which is still being 
used, I understand. And then my senior year, I was

14:46.949 --> 14:50.072
on the second floor of Milner Hall. I believe that 
hall is still being used. Okay, did they, you said

14:54.512 --> 15:03.983
something about earlier about having, being able 
to get an excuse from during quiet time to go to the

14:54.512 --> 15:03.983
latrine. Did you have one on every floor of the 
dorms or did you have a separate building for that?

15:09.450 --> 15:14.316
No, in Leggett Hall, Mildenhall, both there was a 
central latrine. On each floor? Oh yeah.

15:22.722 --> 15:31.813
What privileges did the upperclassmen have that 
the freshmen didn't enjoy? The first year, the

15:31.833 --> 15:42.045
freshmen could go to town on Saturday afternoon.

15:42.065 --> 15:43.687
There was a car there that ran the town. And the 
freshmen would go to town on Saturday afternoon,

15:45.088 --> 15:52.577
but they had to be back in time for the evening meal 
roll call. A sophomore could go to town two nights a

15:53.772 --> 16:01.040
month. That would be in addition to Saturday 
afternoon. Saturday afternoon. A sophomore

16:04.444 --> 16:07.748
could go two nights a month. A junior could go four 
nights a month. Saturday nights, not during the

16:12.132 --> 16:18.039
week night, but he could go Saturday night. Every 
night as a junior. And seniors go and come at will

16:23.708 --> 16:26.652
whenever and wherever they wanted to. Seniors ran 
that outfit, senior officers, the captain of your

16:27.333 --> 16:40.572
company, lieutenants, and they ran the school. 
They would. You had to get permission from them or

16:43.617 --> 16:47.823
anything. What sort of things did the freshmen 
have to do for the upperclassmen?

16:55.147 --> 17:16.337
Well, of course, hazing was quite prevalent then, 
and they had to run errands for them, and they had to

16:55.147 --> 17:16.337
address them as mister, and that's why they got the 
paddle pretty heavy. Of course, hazing was

17:16.357 --> 17:24.428
against the rules, and if you caught hazing while 
you were expelled, but somehow they never did

17:25.690 --> 17:28.713
catch very many of them. Was that a permanent 
expulsion or just a temporary one? No, they were

17:31.816 --> 17:35.359
expelled from school for hazing. No, I was 
wondering whether they were just expelled say for

17:35.379 --> 17:40.944
the rest of the semester or whether they were 
allowed to come back. I guess maybe they could come

17:41.485 --> 17:45.388
back the next year probably if they'd come back and 
apologize. I don't know, but I know that, oh there

17:45.408 --> 17:53.215
was, I don't know how many were expelled a year, 
maybe 10 or 15. I don't know. There were a lot more of

17:54.378 --> 17:58.242
them than that did hazing, I take it. There's about 
15 that didn't do hazing,

17:58.262 --> 18:03.547
I think. Okay, you mentioned running errands. 
Would this be going to the laundry? Well, they

18:10.414 --> 18:11.695
delivered the laundry. No, you'd have to go down to 
the drug store to get a cigar or just anything that a

18:11.735 --> 18:22.326
sophomore wanted to do. Sophomores did most of the 
hazing. And the juniors,

18:24.635 --> 18:31.965
the sophomores, they're the ones that carried the 
big battle. The juniors in Nazareth, they were

18:31.985 --> 18:35.209
more mature. Of course, if they wanted anything, 
they had the best fish to go do something for them.

18:40.476 --> 18:42.598
And the seniors didn't do any hazing at all. But 
nevertheless, they pretty well controlled

18:45.382 --> 18:47.745
things. Oh, yes. He was a commissioned officer of 
your company.

18:57.878 --> 19:04.367
Did you, did

18:57.878 --> 19:04.367
they still have wood stoves in the dorms? Did you 
have to go get wood and things like that for them?

19:06.290 --> 19:07.291
Did they have central heating? No, in Leggett Hall 
and Millnau and all of this, it was central

19:07.732 --> 19:13.941
heating. Central heating. Radiators. I guess 
that still is.

19:21.792 --> 19:22.032
Yeah, I see. Okay. What did the students do for 
entertainment and recreation, like what they did

19:24.203 --> 19:30.833
when they weren't in class? Well, they had the 
intramural athletics. Did most of them

19:36.561 --> 19:40.848
participate in that? No, I'd say they did. I don't 
know what percentage. How was that arranged? Was

19:46.096 --> 19:49.080
that on a company basis? Each company had the 
athletic baseball team, or football team,

19:50.495 --> 19:59.368
yes. There's about a hundred, or about 
seventy-five in each company. And the football

20:09.223 --> 20:13.009
team would be at least eleven. That's right. Well, 
they'd play. I was in Company L and Company L would

20:16.550 --> 20:23.437
play the other company

20:16.550 --> 20:23.437
you wanted. So did you play for a regular 
championship then among the various companies?

20:27.802 --> 20:28.563
Oh yes. It was a competition to see who was the top 
intramural

20:28.703 --> 20:38.894
team. A lot of them would make good in the 
intramural team. they would go down and get on the

20:42.908 --> 20:46.433
varsity team. The coaches watched them.

20:52.241 --> 20:54.944
Well, what about dances or things of that nature? 
Well, the freshmen didn't go to any dances. But the

21:02.495 --> 21:04.477
three of the class, they'd have dances.

21:07.421 --> 21:08.663
And of course, the seniors were.

21:12.473 --> 21:15.297
We had dances. Got all the girls from Brown. Many of 
them bring the girls from their hometowns? Quite

21:21.806 --> 21:22.326
often. Quite often. After you got up to be in that 
class one time. The girl would be a guest or a friend

21:27.213 --> 21:31.579
of yours, maybe a professor or somebody on the 
campus. They'd let the girls stay with them while

21:32.540 --> 21:37.207
they were doing the dance. Did the girls ever stay 
in some of the dormitories? At one point I

21:41.684 --> 21:48.296
understood that sometimes they would throw all 
the boys out of one of the dormitories and put all

21:41.684 --> 21:48.296
the girls up. My time, my time. Primarily they 
stayed with faculty members. That's faculty

21:51.402 --> 21:52.765
members. At that point I believe they all lived on 
campus, didn't they? Or almost all of them anyway.

21:56.251 --> 21:56.873
The campus? Yeah. The faculty? Faculty, yeah. 
Okay. You mentioned that you could go down to Bryan

22:03.065 --> 22:08.457
occasionally. For what purpose did people go down 
to Bryan? Oh, go to the big show or just get away from

22:11.524 --> 22:20.044
the campus

22:11.524 --> 22:20.044
on Saturday afternoon. Go down there and play 
pool. I believe I heard Mr. Langford say that one of

22:22.977 --> 22:35.094
the reasons the school was located where it was, as 
far away from Bryan as it was, was to get away from

22:22.977 --> 22:35.094
the saloons in Bryan. Did any of the boys go down 
there to partake of the... Bryan was dry. It was dry

22:40.201 --> 22:41.282
at that time. Yeah, dry when I was there. They got 
all the liquor down there across the river.

22:46.329 --> 22:48.392
Burleson County, that's where it was. But I'll say 
this. In four years there, I would say that I didn't

22:52.103 --> 23:06.481
see

22:52.103 --> 23:06.481
five, I don't know, but very, very few drunk 
cadets. They didn't drink. They didn't keep

23:10.786 --> 23:12.609
liquor in the rooms. I never saw a boy have liquor in 
his room. Well, that was a pretty serious offense

23:15.492 --> 23:17.695
for one thing, wasn't it? Oh, it was an expulsion, 
absolutely.

23:24.520 --> 23:25.681
They'd do some little drinking. Now every year, 
they'd take the Corps to Dallas Fair. And we'd

23:31.947 --> 23:42.778
parade down the street there in Dallas, go up on a 
special train, early morning train, at the ball

23:31.947 --> 23:42.778
game.

23:47.122 --> 23:53.228
I've seen some boys that got a little liquored up at 
Dallas, but might have probably stayed. No, but

23:54.187 --> 24:15.096
back to what I was saying earlier, Mr. Lankford, 
either he or somebody else said that in 76 when they

23:54.187 --> 24:15.096
started the school, I think there were 12 saloons 
in Bryan, and at that point I would imagine that

23:54.187 --> 24:15.096
that would have been an unfortunate... Well, they 
bought the dry after that, you see. Brazos County

24:15.137 --> 24:19.603
was dry when I was... Wellesley County, of course, 
the river was wet. Yeah. That was, I guess, just

24:21.035 --> 24:26.883
since I'd been there, Brazos County. Well, they 
sold beer, but they didn't have any liquor stores,

24:27.303 --> 24:40.381
and they still had one just across the bridge going 
out of College Station.

24:40.761 --> 24:46.789
Did they also go to Bryan to shop, or could they buy 
everything they needed on campus? Oh, you could

24:47.410 --> 24:51.634
buy whatever you need down there. Cosmetics, 
toothpaste, and et cetera. But they weren't any

24:54.496 --> 25:00.782
good stores at the college station.

25:00.802 --> 25:02.544
You weren't going to buy any clothes, extra 
clothes. Of course, you had to wear a uniform all

25:02.904 --> 25:10.010
the time, both on the campus and off the campus, 
those gray uniforms. Where did you get those? They

25:13.293 --> 25:15.375
issued them to you, except When you got to be an 
upperclassman, there's an old tailor there named

25:15.862 --> 25:33.823
Charlie Hulligan, and he would, as you got to be an 
upperclassman, you wanted to be a little better

25:15.862 --> 25:33.823
dressed instead of issue stuff. Well, Charlie 
made most of the uniforms for the upperclassmen,

25:33.843 --> 25:41.392
tailor-made. What would a full uniform have cost 
you?

25:47.300 --> 25:54.473
There

25:47.300 --> 25:54.473
was a confectionery, I believe, in the basement of 
the YMCA, was there not? Or did that come along

25:54.694 --> 25:55.836
later? No, it came along later. There was a 
confectionery down there, a little frame

25:56.797 --> 26:06.355
building down there, where the trolley car 
stopped, down there close to Speezer Hall. Was

26:07.027 --> 26:09.329
there a station where the trolley car stopped? No, 
no station. Was there a platform or anything to get

26:10.871 --> 26:14.174
under when you waited for the train? No, you run 
into the trucks and run into the perfection

26:14.194 --> 26:26.426
yard. You mentioned earlier that the seniors 
really sort of ran the Corps of Cadets, were there

26:33.014 --> 26:39.680
any special privileges that they said the cadet 
officers had? Say, could a junior cadet officer,

26:41.142 --> 26:50.511
who was a higher ranking officer than, say, a 
fellow junior, did he have any privileges?

26:53.093 --> 26:56.197
You're a freshman of all privates, see. And the 
sophomores who did good, did well, were the

26:57.217 --> 27:02.903
corporals. And the juniors were the sergeants. 
Not all juniors. I mean, the top juniors, they were

27:09.039 --> 27:13.223
sergeants. And then the seniors were the 
commissioned officers. That'd be for everything

27:16.366 --> 27:18.488
from lieutenant on up. That's right. And then, of 
course, they had the staff. They went on up to staff

27:21.791 --> 27:25.995
officers, majors, lieutenant colonels, and 
colonels. Yeah. OK. So then, basically, all

27:28.417 --> 27:32.941
sophomores were in the same military rank. Yes. 
and all juniors. And the seniors were the only ones

27:37.263 --> 27:40.989
who had higher ranks. That's right. They were all 
privates. And they had some senior privates that

27:46.138 --> 27:53.250
didn't qualify to be commissioned officers. And 
they were just, well, they didn't have anything to

27:53.270 --> 27:58.759
do with But they were called senior privates. They 
didn't have any formations to make. All they did

28:08.390 --> 28:10.294
was sleep mean. Well, they didn't have to make 
formations for breakfast? Not the senior

28:14.101 --> 28:15.784
privates. No, they didn't have to make any. What 
about drill? Did they have to do any drill at all?

28:23.677 --> 28:23.738
No. Were there any students there, when you were 
there, who were not in the Corps of Cadets. No. Even

28:30.801 --> 28:42.419
the, you take the disabled boys,

28:30.801 --> 28:42.419
they gave them, most of them were buglers, taught 
them to blow the bugle. Each company had a bugler.

28:46.565 --> 28:55.459
And the boy was disabled, couldn't participate in 
his drill, his uniform, and his drills were They

28:56.587 --> 29:03.236
would designate him as a bugler and took him out 
there and showed him how to blow the bugle. And then

29:03.256 --> 29:10.185
he would do all the signals then in the morning and 
each meal? Well, they would designate one bugler

29:10.305 --> 29:22.020
as the bugler of the week and had a big microphone, I 
mean loudspeaker there that did bugle over. They

29:22.608 --> 29:24.552
wouldn't all blow the bugle all the time. They'd 
just have a bugle of the week or the bugle of the day.

29:31.125 --> 29:34.773
They'd want to make just one man would do all that 
bugling. Okay, I think I'm about out of space here.

29:38.741 --> 29:39.402
Let me...
