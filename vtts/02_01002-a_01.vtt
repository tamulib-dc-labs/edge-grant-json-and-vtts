WEBVTT

00:02.275 --> 00:10.783
with Bob Mathis by Julie Hopson on 18 November 1988 
at the custodial apartment in the physical plant

00:02.275 --> 00:10.783
at Texas A&M University concerning the Vietnam 
War. In the interest of accumulating knowledge

00:11.484 --> 00:19.031
about the war, I'm going to donate this tape to the 
Texas A&M Oil History Collection and the

00:11.484 --> 00:19.031
University Archives. Is that all right with you? 
That's fine with me. Okay. I need your date and

00:23.556 --> 00:25.377
place of birth. November the 21st, 1941, Sport, 
Illinois. Where did you go to school? I went to

00:33.221 --> 00:35.623
school in several different places. My father was 
in the military. I graduated from high school in

00:37.765 --> 00:40.548
Inazuki, Japan. Did you attend college? I had two 
years of college in the University of Maryland.

00:47.996 --> 00:48.697
What did you study? Business. Did you like it? 
Well, I took it in sub-courses and everything when

00:53.682 --> 00:58.067
I was in the military in Germany. University of 
Maryland goes all over Europe and they have

00:59.532 --> 01:08.883
classes

00:59.532 --> 01:08.883
at night. Okay. Why did you join the military? 
Well, I wanted to be a soldier all my life. My father

01:14.890 --> 01:23.660
was, uh, spent 28 years in the military and he was 
still on active duty when I graduated from high

01:14.890 --> 01:23.660
school. My brother retired for 22 years as a First 
Sergeant in the Marine Corps. And it's just

01:28.507 --> 01:31.450
something that my family's done all their lives. I 
like the military. How did you go about joining the

01:35.634 --> 01:37.196
military?

01:39.799 --> 01:49.849
Well, I walked into the recruiting depot in Rapid 
City, South Dakota when I turned 18 years old and

01:39.799 --> 01:49.849
told them that I wanted to join. And they told me 
that I had to have my parents' permission, so I went

01:49.869 --> 01:55.375
home and I got my mom and dad and we'd go back to the 
recruiting depot, and they signed the papers, and

01:56.030 --> 02:01.436
I left the next day. What year was this? 1960.

02:07.904 --> 02:10.347
Is your brother older or younger than you? Dick's 
older than I am. What year did he join? 1959. What

02:16.133 --> 02:17.315
branch did you join? I joined the Army. Why? Well, 
at the time, I wanted to get married. And I knew that

02:24.397 --> 02:31.947
to get rapid promotion, I had to get into a 
particular branch of service that had

02:24.397 --> 02:31.947
accelerated promotions. I knew from being with my 
dad that the Air Force does not have accelerated

02:31.967 --> 02:36.293
promotions. And I knew that the Marine Corps would 
keep you corporal for years. So I was working for a

02:40.919 --> 02:50.893
guy named Casey Tips riding the fence line in South 
Dakota, and we had some Nike sites that was

02:40.919 --> 02:50.893
bordered our property. And I talked to those guys, 
and they were all in the military, but they were in

02:51.734 --> 02:56.059
missiles. And they said that the fastest thing was 
to join the armored cab units and be a recon

02:56.659 --> 03:02.746
specialist. So that's what I did. It took me 17 
months to

03:05.709 --> 03:10.254
make sergeant. When did you go to Vietnam? The 
first time I went to Vietnam was in October of 1967.

03:18.003 --> 03:21.707
What did you do in the Army between 1961 and 1967? I 
was a recon specialist. I worked for the armored

03:24.667 --> 03:36.587
cab units and guarding the Czech border and 
running border patrols and things like that in

03:24.667 --> 03:36.587
Germany. Were you a German helicopter? No. I took 
my basic training at a place called Fort Ord,

03:39.612 --> 03:42.717
California. I took my advanced training at Fort 
Knox, Kentucky. And right after I got out of

03:48.080 --> 03:53.845
advanced training, I joined the 32nd Armored 
Battalion in Fort Stewart, Georgia. And right

03:54.946 --> 03:59.771
after that, somebody in Berlin started building a 
brick wall. And I gyroed to Europe with a 3rd

03:59.791 --> 04:07.238
Battalion, 32nd Armored, and I stayed there for 
three years. I was a little upset about that

04:07.358 --> 04:12.603
because I had two days to go before I started my 
30-day leave to get married. And the 1st Sergeant

04:13.263 --> 04:17.327
tore up my leave papers, and we were all on alert. I 
was going to strike one unit, and we all went to

04:17.577 --> 04:23.148
Germany on a boat.

04:27.216 --> 04:29.320
Did you stay in Germany the whole time before you 
went to Vietnam? No. I stayed in Germany until

04:31.845 --> 04:38.758
1964, and that was in southern Bavaria at a place 
called Augsburg. which was about 60 miles north of

04:39.430 --> 04:42.556
Munich, a real nice place. Cold a lot. And then in 
1964, I came back from Germany. I went to a little

04:50.570 --> 04:56.341
summer spot called Fort Hood, Texas, which is 
really something else. We'll talk about that when

04:56.441 --> 04:58.485
we're not on tape. And then from Fort Hood, I stayed 
there nine months, and then I went to Fort Bliss. I

05:03.553 --> 05:05.776
thought Hood was bad, but Bliss was worse. This is 
when I heard about a little conflict called

05:05.796 --> 05:13.687
Vietnam, and I volunteered to go to Vietnam in 
1965. I got orders to go to Vietnam in 1966,

05:13.707 --> 05:23.180
and I was supposed to join the 11th Infantry 
Brigade in Hawaii, and we would go as a unit. Well, I

05:23.821 --> 05:25.863
got to Hawaii in 1966. I was set to go to Vietnam. And 
there was myself and 11 other guys there. And we

05:33.703 --> 05:36.027
were the nucleus of the 11th Infantry Brigade. As a 
matter of record, there was a young captain there

05:36.287 --> 05:43.057
named Bill Carpenter, William Carpenter. He's 
now a general officer. All the guys in the military

05:45.340 --> 05:50.227
called him Maypom VI because he was put up for the 
Congressional Medal of Honor. He was one of the

05:50.287 --> 05:53.532
first guys to call Maypom on his own position.

05:56.026 --> 06:00.690
Somebody that's listened to this tape that knows 
anything about the military may recognize the

05:56.026 --> 06:00.690
name. He was called the Lonesome Inn at West Point. 
He played football. But we got some of McNamara's

06:06.676 --> 06:09.619
100,000. Have you heard that term? We got some of 
McNamara's 100,000 in Hawaii, and we trained them

06:12.081 --> 06:23.232
in the mountains in counterinsurgency 
operations, ambush techniques, and things like

06:12.081 --> 06:23.232
that for... until October of 67 and then somebody 
thought that we needed to escalate the number of

06:24.038 --> 06:39.259
troops that were in South Vietnam so the 11th 
Infantry Brigade got three ships and it took us 33

06:24.038 --> 06:39.259
days to get to South Vietnam. Now we got there in 14 
days but General Westmoreland did not know where

06:39.399 --> 06:51.936
he wanted to end service in the country so we sailed 
up and down the China Sea for about 20 days until

06:53.080 --> 07:02.872
they figured that we needed to go into a little town 
called Duck Fo, which was just north of a place

06:53.080 --> 07:02.872
called Queen Yon, about 55 miles. It was between 
Chew Line and Queen Yon. Matter of fact, a little

07:07.457 --> 07:17.549
town called My Line is about 20 miles north

07:07.457 --> 07:17.549
of Duck Fo. Why did it take two years almost from the 
time you volunteers going to Vietnam for you to get

07:22.088 --> 07:24.211
there? Well, I went to a unit. I had a specific unit 
assignment. And the 11th Infantry Brigade was a

07:30.259 --> 07:37.728
redesignated unit that they just brought back on 
paper. It wasn't really a unit in itself because it

07:37.768 --> 07:40.832
didn't have all the people. So they formed it on 
paper. The 25th Infantry Division was out of

07:43.997 --> 07:50.285
Hawaii and already in Vietnam. And but they might 
not have been in Vietnam. They were either in the

07:53.127 --> 07:57.892
Philippines or Thailand. That's the Tropical 
Infantry Division, 25th Infantry Division. And

08:04.218 --> 08:10.044
they were gone, so they needed a brigade in Hawaii. 
And that's where we trained. That was the best

08:11.005 --> 08:19.753
place we thought to train somebody for 
counterinsurgency because of the terrain and the

08:11.005 --> 08:19.753
rain and the mountains and the trails and stuff 
like that were basically the same thing as South

08:20.358 --> 08:22.240
Vietnam. So we got all these guys right out of basic 
training. They didn't even go to their advanced

08:27.106 --> 08:29.108
training units. They came straight out of basic 
training to us. We gave them their advanced

08:31.871 --> 08:41.382
training, but it was all geared towards ambushes 
and counterinsurgency operations in South

08:31.871 --> 08:41.382
Vietnam.

08:41.402 --> 08:44.586
What did y'all do when you got to Duckburg? Well, 
the first thing we done was set up a perimeter. It

08:49.711 --> 08:50.973
was basically already there. There was another 
unit there that had established the fire base.

08:55.418 --> 09:04.228
There was a runway there and it was a brigade size 
fire base. So when they gave us duck foe, they

09:04.248 --> 09:13.078
initially gave us an area of operations that 
required four battalions. Now, we had left one

09:13.531 --> 09:20.560
battalion in Hawaii because it wasn't fully 
staffed yet, and they hadn't received all their

09:13.531 --> 09:20.560
training. So until that battalion joined us in 
Hawaii, they made up a task force called Task Force

09:20.580 --> 09:27.268
Barker. And what they did then is they pulled an 
empty company from each of the other three empty

09:28.610 --> 09:38.843
battalions, and they pulled a platoon from the 
recon troop that I was in. Well, the platoon that I

09:38.863 --> 09:41.967
had went to Task Force Barker. Now, this was... 
Company C, which was Captain Medina's outfit that

09:43.636 --> 09:49.303
had Lieutenant Calley in it. And then there was 
Captain Black. I don't remember the other guy's

09:55.370 --> 09:56.972
name. But Major Couch was the S3. I don't remember 
the Sergeant Major's name. And, of course,

10:03.400 --> 10:07.065
Colonel Barker was the task force commander. And 
we assumed part of the area of operations, which

10:07.085 --> 10:11.230
was just north of Quang Nang. Quang Nai was about 20 
miles north of Duc Pho, and it was a major target for

10:11.665 --> 10:21.374
the Tet Offensive because it had a major airport. 
And Quang Nai was about, I guess, 20 miles south of

10:21.394 --> 10:30.483
Chi Lai, which was the Americana Division. When we 
first got there, we stayed as a separate brigade,

10:30.683 --> 10:34.647
separate infantry brigade. And then, I guess, 
about right after Tet started, They took the

10:40.252 --> 10:51.544
193rd, the 198th, the 196th, the 11th Infantry 
Brigade, and another Infantry Brigade and put

10:40.252 --> 10:51.544
them all together and formed the Americal 
Division. And the Americal Division

10:53.946 --> 10:59.452
headquarters was in July. Did you see much action 
before that? No, what they basically did at first

11:02.655 --> 11:10.123
is they sent us out with other units that were still 
in the area to learn what the area looked like. We

11:13.342 --> 11:16.845
basically fought, uh, BC, not too many NBAs. Uh, 
and we just operated patrols, did some

11:18.447 --> 11:30.818
counterinsurgency operations, uh, and every 
time we'd get off the highway, we'd just start

11:18.447 --> 11:30.818
getting farther and farther back into the hills. 
And we'd run over to the beach on the China Sea and

11:32.119 --> 11:40.707
we'd run up and down through, uh, my life in this 
one, through areas like that. It was a real,

11:41.761 --> 12:10.418
dominated area as far as the uh bc were concerned 
because they've been in there for years but it was

11:41.761 --> 12:10.418
basically uh i guess about the first four months we 
were there uh captain medina told me that he lost at

11:41.761 --> 12:10.418
least a third of his people to nothing but booby 
traps and uh he exhausted malaria and snipers so

11:41.761 --> 12:10.418
major contacts were not uh not really a a problem 
with us. It was the squad-sized ambushes and

12:12.258 --> 12:18.486
things like that. The first year I was there, we 
didn't have any major battles. Well, there was a

12:23.572 --> 12:25.975
couple. They'd last a day or two, and we'd pull 
back, or they'd leave or hide or something. Where

12:32.384 --> 12:34.446
were you when that occurred? I was sitting on a 
bridge just north of Quang Mai. that was supposed

12:41.212 --> 12:47.500
to be, it was right on Highway 1, and it was right 
outside of Arvin Fire Base. And they were supposed

12:49.083 --> 13:06.867
to secure it, but it had been blown two or three 
times, and it was a Bailey Bridge put in by American

12:49.083 --> 13:06.867
engineers, so they put American troops on the 
bridges and pulled them back out of the field and

12:49.083 --> 13:06.867
just put them on these strong points so the VC 
wouldn't blow the bridges and cut our main supply

12:49.083 --> 13:06.867
routes. And We got a call from the task force 
commander, Colonel Barker, that morning that the

13:09.916 --> 13:34.425
Arvin advisors in Quang Nai would like an American 
force to come down and just ride around the city and

13:09.916 --> 13:34.425
show the South Vietnamese people that, hey, the 
Americans are here, their equipment's here,

13:09.916 --> 13:34.425
their men are here, and they're here to support us 
in this conflict against the North Vietnamese.

13:34.445 --> 13:37.729
And we said, sure, we're not doing anything 
anyhow. We went down to Quang Mai in 10 armored cab

13:38.654 --> 13:47.042
vehicles, and we were half-manded because we 
still had to maintain security for three bridges.

13:48.123 --> 13:49.364
So my platoon went down. This is when I had an 
armored cab platoon. And we went down there, and we

13:53.528 --> 14:00.315
were riding around, just going up and down the 
streets real slow, waving to the kids, throwing

13:53.528 --> 14:00.315
them candy. You know, it was like a big parade. And 
this jeep with this American advisor comes

14:02.637 --> 14:07.902
tearing up to the front of the column and stops my 
platoon leader. His name was Lieutenant Ole. I

14:11.558 --> 14:16.121
think he's a captain in the Indiana Highway Patrol 
now. And they stopped our column there and the guy

14:16.141 --> 14:22.587
says, hey, would you guys like to get into a 
firefight? Well, we'd been in country a month and a

14:22.647 --> 14:37.539
half and we fired at some snipers and, you know, we 
had a little H&I at night and we fired some

14:22.647 --> 14:37.539
artillery here and there just to see, you know, 
keep in practice because we were all recon and we

14:22.647 --> 14:37.539
like to keep up with those things. So, Lieutenant 
Owen said, why sure, we'd be glad to help you. So we

14:42.797 --> 14:49.385
go over to the airport, and there's a railroad 
running right next to the airport, and there was a

14:42.797 --> 14:49.385
big dike there. And we see all these South 
Vietnamese soldiers laying alongside this dike,

14:49.405 --> 14:59.357
and they're all pointing over towards the 
northeast, and there was a little village, and it

14:49.405 --> 14:59.357
was surrounded by sugar cane. And we kept, we 
didn't hear any rounds going off, we didn't hear

15:00.859 --> 15:05.405
any firing or anything like this. Well, what had 
happened is the South Vietnamese were on one side,

15:09.357 --> 15:10.298
And there was a B.C. heavy weapons company inside 
the village on the other side, and nobody had fired

15:11.240 --> 15:18.370
around yet. So they come to get this armored camp 
platoon because we had .50 caliber machine guns.

15:23.518 --> 15:26.101
We had a .50 caliber on each PC. We had two M60 
machine guns on each PC. We didn't have any gun

15:29.586 --> 15:33.813
shields yet because those were new and we hadn't 
received them. So all we had up there was the

15:33.833 --> 15:35.795
machine guns. And then... Of course, we didn't 
have the other two guys in the back for the machine

15:38.568 --> 15:43.315
guns because we had left them on the bridge. So what 
we had in each PC was a driver, we had a vehicle

15:43.335 --> 15:53.590
commander on the .50 caliber, and we had one man in 
the back, which was on an M79, what we called a

15:43.335 --> 15:53.590
Blooper. Shot a 40-millimeter shell. And so 
that's all we had in these 10 tracks. And we had our

16:02.103 --> 16:06.229
little cab tenants flying off the antennas and 
stuff, you know. We were just real hot to try. Never

16:08.079 --> 16:09.480
been shot at before. Didn't really know what we 
were doing. I'd been in the Army 10 years and had

16:10.982 --> 16:18.750
participated in a lot of live fire exercises, but 
this was going to be my first time. So when we got

16:20.112 --> 16:34.007
over to the berm and they told us exactly where they 
were and then you hear this little L-19 circling

16:20.112 --> 16:34.007
around up there saying, I see them, I see them, 
they're in the village, you know, and they're just

16:20.112 --> 16:34.007
sitting there eating. So we got... We got online, 
and we went up over the berm, and we got into the

16:36.432 --> 16:40.096
sugar cane. Well, we lost sight of each other. We 
were real close when we first started out to

16:41.558 --> 16:44.541
maintain eye contact. But after that, I got on the 
radio, and I said, look for the antennas, the

16:45.322 --> 16:52.650
little cap, and it's on the antennas to keep you 
online. I said, we'll go up here about another 50

16:52.670 --> 16:54.672
meters. We'll take a hard left, and we'll come 
online into the village. Well, we came online just

17:00.278 --> 17:04.363
to the edge of the village, And we broke out a sugar 
cane field, and I saw this guy standing over next to

17:04.917 --> 17:11.444
the wall of this last building over there. And he 
had his rifle in his arms, and he was standing there

17:11.624 --> 17:15.708
smoking a cigarette. Well, to tell you the truth, I 
didn't know if he was a good guy or a bad guy. But I

17:21.253 --> 17:27.259
shot him with my .50 caliber, picked him clean up 
off the ground, and held him up there for about 10

17:21.253 --> 17:27.259
seconds. And after that, I want you to know that 
just all hell broke loose. I mean, it seemed like

17:30.543 --> 17:32.865
the whole village exploded. fifties were going 
off, people were yelling on the radio, I'm hit, I'm

17:33.487 --> 17:42.140
hit, and we stayed in there for about 35 minutes. 
Now, we were using armored piercing incendiary

17:42.240 --> 17:47.088
rounds in our .50 caliber machine guns. We picked 
it up from the Navy. And as those rounds would go

17:50.252 --> 17:53.878
through something, they'd catch it on fire. So it 
took about 30 seconds there after everybody got

17:54.579 --> 17:58.605
off their first 50 rounds. We had the whole village 
burning. And we were receiving a lot of rounds

18:02.225 --> 18:13.998
back, a lot of automatic weapons, AKs, a couple of 
heavy machine guns, because they were tearing

18:02.225 --> 18:13.998
some holes in those PCs that were supposed to be 
armored vehicles. Well, don't believe

18:14.979 --> 18:19.544
everything you hear, okay? And it got pretty bad in 
there, and after a while, we started throwing

18:19.724 --> 18:28.915
grenades into the hedgerows and stuff, and then 
the firing just stopped. So... We got a hold of the

18:30.085 --> 18:31.968
guy in the L-19. He says, yeah, they're going out 
the backside of the village, and they're running

18:31.988 --> 18:41.243
into the sugar cane, heading for a tree line, which 
was about 900 meters away. But they had cover in the

18:41.604 --> 18:45.450
sugar cane fields all the way over there. So we 
started, Lieutenant Ole started, you know, doing

18:45.691 --> 18:56.869
some artillery adjusting and was using the guy in 
the L-19 as a spotter, but we were using our guns off

18:57.541 --> 19:02.107
the fire base that we came from, which was just 
north of there. So this was actually the first day

19:02.127 --> 19:13.622
of Tet, but, you know, nobody had told us about Tet 
except it was going to be a ceasefire and nothing

19:02.127 --> 19:13.622
was going to happen. And we couldn't figure out why 
the Arvin were still laying back there on the berm.

19:17.727 --> 19:20.511
So we pulled back to the far side of the berm and use 
the Arvin as security, and we checked our weapons

19:21.402 --> 19:28.130
and stuff again, and we're all laughing, and we got 
a couple guys medevaced. One guy took a round right

19:28.270 --> 19:30.632
through the palm of his hand. Another one had his 
ear shot off, and, you know, a couple things like

19:31.453 --> 19:35.338
that. But it had, you know, now we're all excited, 
and it hadn't hit us on what, you know, you can get

19:36.179 --> 19:43.947
killed doing this, you know. But, uh, We said, 
okay, if they went out to the northeast side of the

19:44.875 --> 19:49.600
village, then we'll just run around there. We'll 
go around the village and we'll hit them again.

19:52.884 --> 19:56.648
Well, we went around there, and we couldn't find 
them. So we've got our PCs parked about 25 meters

19:56.668 --> 20:00.653
apart. I and a guy named B.J. Babbage, which is 
another vehicle commander, we get down off our PCs

20:04.157 --> 20:12.446
and walk over to our platoon leader's track. Now, 
we're out in an open field. And we're standing

20:16.364 --> 20:25.157
there smoking a cigarette and jacking the jaw a 
little bit, talking about how crummy the VC are

20:16.364 --> 20:25.157
because they won't stand and fight and 
everything. And some guy from the sugar cane field

20:25.878 --> 20:29.865
opens up on us with a machine gun. Well, as I am 
hastily moving back to my vehicle, I lost my

20:30.966 --> 20:38.337
sunglasses. And they were prescription 
sunglasses. That's the basic thing that I

20:40.300 --> 20:44.667
remember about that day that I got upset because I 
lost my sunglasses. So we started shooting up the

20:45.237 --> 20:49.583
sugarcane fields, burning it, and everything 
else. And it was starting to get dark. So we were

20:52.126 --> 20:56.132
going to have to move out and go back up north and 
secure our three bridges. So we did that because we

20:57.834 --> 21:01.359
were just down there on loan to them. Well, the next 
morning, they called us and said, Hey, we went in

21:01.919 --> 21:12.814
with the Arvin through the village and have 
determined that y'all killed 126 B.C., And we've

21:13.081 --> 21:16.185
got the weapons and the radios, and we've got a good 
body count. And we said, well, that's just great.

21:18.168 --> 21:24.797
But we can't give you guys credit for it because the 
Arvins were there, and we're trying to build up

21:18.168 --> 21:24.797
their morale and everything. So we made it known 
that the Arvin wiped out a heavy weapons company of

21:25.258 --> 21:30.745
126 men. I said, well, ain't this something. So we 
went back down there, and while we were, Moving

21:38.410 --> 21:41.394
back down there, they had brought the whole cab 
troop. Now we're talking about four platoons of

21:41.414 --> 21:45.019
ten vehicles each. They had brought the whole cab 
troop up that night to help secure the western side

21:46.000 --> 21:57.315
of Quang Nam out by the airport. And I'm glad they 
brought the whole cab troop up there and we went

21:57.335 --> 22:01.922
back and secured our bridges. Because when we got 
back up there, there were PCs smoking all over the

22:01.942 --> 22:05.987
place. They'd been blown up. They had about 12 guys 
killed. And that's when the gooks, the VC, came out

22:09.913 --> 22:19.006
with their RPG-7s and their B-40 rockets. See, 
they thought they were just going to waltz into

22:19.226 --> 22:25.956
town because they knew that the Arbors didn't have 
any armored vehicles there in that town. And they

22:26.497 --> 22:33.807
didn't know, I guess, their intelligence was 
poor, and they didn't know that an armored cab unit

22:26.497 --> 22:33.807
had pulled into that AO. But there we were. So the 
first time they got in a fight down there, they

22:35.701 --> 22:40.446
didn't have anything to take care of their own 
vehicles. But let me tell you that the RPG-7 is 20

22:40.466 --> 22:45.392
years ahead of its time. That has got to be the best 
anti-tank vehicle. It will knock out any known

22:51.198 --> 22:56.784
tank on the battlefield today, with the exception 
of now the General Abrams. It won't knock out the M1

22:56.804 --> 22:58.966
tank. But it'll do a job on anything else it wants to 
do. I get carried away, so you'll have to stop me

23:04.034 --> 23:07.519
when you want to. After that, we figured out, hey, 
this is Ted. We were hit every night on the bridges.

23:19.134 --> 23:20.416
Got bad there for a while. After the next three 
weeks, it got bad. We got rough bus, which were

23:22.979 --> 23:29.848
regional forces to come in and take care of the 
bridge security. We brought the families in with

23:30.329 --> 23:33.653
them so we could give them security during the 
night. During the day with the armored vehicles,

23:34.409 --> 23:43.778
we could operate 10 or 15 clicks off the road and 
still get back in and secure the bridges and stuff

23:34.409 --> 23:43.778
at night. Fire missions all the time, snipers all 
night long, snappers trying to infiltrate your

23:45.540 --> 24:03.117
wire and blow you the bridges to cut your supply 
line because we were, we straddled Highway 1, the

23:45.540 --> 24:03.117
whole 11th Infantry Brigade did, basically all 
the way down from the Bonson Plains to about five

24:04.109 --> 24:11.259
flicks south of Chew Line was the 11th Infantry 
Brigade area of operations. And every once in a

24:11.479 --> 24:19.871
while, we'd go down and eat chow with the 173rd, who 
was at LZ English, which they were in the box on

24:11.479 --> 24:19.871
planes. Crazy outfit. They used to throw hand 
grenades at each other in the chow line, just, you

24:20.752 --> 24:29.924
know, to scare people. Did Arvin help you while you 
were taking that village, or did they just stay?

24:34.703 --> 24:39.489
No, they stayed back there on the backside of the 
berm. And I can understand that because they had M1

24:39.509 --> 24:46.157
carbines and they had M1 rifles and hand grenades. 
They were a typical infantry unit. They didn't

24:50.403 --> 24:54.528
have any automatic weapons with them at the time. 
About a week after that, that Auburn battalion got

24:55.469 --> 25:02.618
overrun by the 41st VC Regiment. and was 
completely annihilated. They lost all their

25:05.214 --> 25:07.797
weapons, all their uniforms and everything. So 
for the next four or five weeks in our area of

25:07.857 --> 25:13.144
operation, you didn't know who was shooting at 
you. You know, it could have been the same bunch

25:13.164 --> 25:21.133
wearing GI clothes that they got off this Arvin 
battalion, and they were using American weapons.

25:21.193 --> 25:26.479
So it got hard to tell who was who there for a while 
until you got it all sorted out. But during Tet, you

25:27.218 --> 25:31.685
didn't have to call anybody and say, hey, we're 
being shot at. We need to return fire or anything

25:31.705 --> 25:34.590
like that. You know, you knew you were in a combat 
zone, and you just reacted.

25:40.139 --> 25:44.406
What do you think of the Arvin and Greenwood? I was 
afraid he was going to ask me that question. I think

25:48.052 --> 25:53.901
the Arvins, because of the fact that they've been 
fighting for over 100 years, And they had played

25:55.484 --> 26:02.294
games with the French and the Chinese and the 
Japanese, but they were just flat tired. And they

26:04.257 --> 26:16.155
had seen so much suffering that, you

26:04.257 --> 26:16.155
know, if you killed one of their family members, 
they'd cry for a few minutes, and after that they

26:04.257 --> 26:16.155
just got up and went home. There were some good 
Arvin units. I worked with an Arvin unit, which was

26:19.079 --> 26:23.145
the 14th Arvin Cav Squadron, It was a regiment that 
was, this was the second time I was in Vietnam. And

26:28.139 --> 26:29.842
they operated out of Pleiku. And they had a little 
colonel that

26:30.123 --> 26:38.797
just thought that the best VC was a dead VC. And he 
didn't believe in the Chew Hoi program. And he

26:42.203 --> 26:46.010
certainly didn't believe in taking prisoners. 
And he had M76s, which was a real fast little tank.

26:50.277 --> 26:51.218
that we had given him. And he just went all over the 
Pleiku area and up and down the Cambodian border

26:51.999 --> 26:58.945
killing as many people as he could. And it was a good 
unit. They would stand and fight. They had a

27:03.250 --> 27:05.191
special scarf that they wore. And you just didn't 
fool around with those Colonel's units. There

27:10.056 --> 27:18.124
were good American units and there were good Arvin 
units and there were bad American units and there

27:10.056 --> 27:18.124
were bad Arvin units. I think towards the end of the 
war, I was there again in 1771. I think at first in 67

27:22.539 --> 27:29.409
and 68, the Army was sort of like we were. I think 
they really had a grip on it and were starting to be

27:29.629 --> 27:34.216
trained good. They were getting equipment from 
us. They were starting to establish a spirit of

27:35.978 --> 27:43.529
corps and morale, and that they really thought 
they could do something. Some of their range units

27:43.549 --> 27:45.732
were just outstanding. I think in 70 and 71, when I 
was back over there again, they saw the Americans

27:47.095 --> 28:00.151
pulling out and cutting down the size of the forces 
that we had over there. And I think their morale and

28:00.171 --> 28:02.834
their spirit of war started going. They were 
slipping. And instead of fighting, they'd move

28:03.695 --> 28:08.160
out. During Tet, which was supposed to be their 
holiday, same as the PC's, I believe they were

28:15.310 --> 28:17.592
basically all on holiday. And it took them a while 
to get their units back together and to get

28:18.033 --> 28:31.547
organized and to realize that, hey, here's a major 
thrust towards the South Vietnamese country. And

28:31.567 --> 28:33.609
everybody's got to fight. And I just think that 
they were tired. They had already had brothers and

28:36.272 --> 28:40.417
sisters and parents killed. Some of them had 
already been wounded two or three times, and they

28:40.857 --> 28:44.541
just never saw an end to it. And we can go over there, 
and if we were lucky, we spent 12 months there. We'd

28:50.810 --> 28:52.753
get a million dollar wound, or we'd come home. 
There's a big difference in fighting in somebody

28:54.976 --> 29:03.248
else's country than fighting on your own. I'd hate 
to see a war break out along the Mexican border or in

29:03.268 --> 29:13.122
Texas, and us have to fight and defend the United 
States and have the fighting actually take place

29:03.268 --> 29:13.122
in our own country. Because then you've got to 
worry about your loved ones, You've got to worry

29:16.482 --> 29:22.888
about all those kind of things, you know, about 
your wife and your kids. And when you're in another

29:22.908 --> 29:33.459
country doing all this fighting, you know they're 
back home going to school, eating three meals a

29:22.908 --> 29:33.459
day, the electricity's still on, the water's 
still running, they got indoor plumbing.

29:36.122 --> 29:38.184
It's a big difference. I like the South End. These 
people, on the whole, are a beautiful group of

29:39.105 --> 29:43.389
people. I felt sorry for them. And unlike a lot of 
other GIs that were in South Vietnam, I'm glad it

29:47.363 --> 29:53.251
was there instead of here. And I'm glad it was them

29:53.271 --> 29:58.818
instead of me. Did you try to work, or did y'all work 
in any pacification programs? Pacification

30:04.665 --> 30:08.590
programs. We moved what we knew to be hardcore VC 
strongholds We'd go in and we'd burn the hootches

30:16.760 --> 30:40.189
down, confiscate all the rice, shoot the 
livestock, and we'd herd up all the people and we'd

30:16.760 --> 30:40.189
take them out and we moved them into a

30:16.760 --> 30:40.189
big village. Now you got these villages out in the 
mountains where the water runs pure, They've been

30:46.274 --> 30:49.898
farming the same land for 50 or 60 years. And 
they've lived and born and died several

30:51.520 --> 30:57.506
generations in the same mud hut, you know. And then 
all of a sudden here these foreigners come in and

30:59.228 --> 31:08.337
destroy everything that their generations have 
lived and built. And they move them into a village

31:08.357 --> 31:13.703
where there's 50,000 people in a city. Now we're 
talking about rural country people. And you move

31:16.784 --> 31:32.852
them into a city where there's bars and bright neon 
lights and easy money and a black market and say,

31:16.784 --> 31:32.852
now this is where you have to live and work and join 
the Arvin army. And you're talking to people that

31:34.840 --> 31:53.585
fought at Thin Ben Pew and thrown the French out, 
and now they've gone back to farming, they're

31:34.840 --> 31:53.585
relaxed, they don't want nothing to do with the 
Arvids, they don't want nothing to do with the NVA,

31:34.840 --> 31:53.585
and they certainly didn't want anything to do with 
the ugly Americans.

31:53.605 --> 32:01.255
So I think the pacification program, I better not 
say that on tape, I think it was a mistake. I think

32:01.275 --> 32:04.780
the idea that some of the Marine Corps units had is 
instead of moving people out of their villages,

32:06.430 --> 32:19.770
they'd move in five-man teams and help secure that 
village so they could harvest their rice and live a

32:06.430 --> 32:19.770
peaceful coexistence. And the five-man Marine 
Corps teams kept the VC out of the villages, you

32:20.731 --> 32:27.281
know, and protected. Now, you lost a lot of Marines 
sometimes because there was good political value

32:27.501 --> 32:35.273
for the VC to get into that kind of village. you 
know, and get to the village chief and stuff like

32:36.164 --> 32:38.466
that. But to me, that kind of program would have 
done more for us than anything else. I think there

32:44.553 --> 32:53.703
was a lot of money wasted and lost for 10 roads and 
pacification programs that never got to the

32:44.553 --> 32:53.703
villager. It stopped off someplace on the way 
down. And all the stuff that was meant for that

32:56.165 --> 33:01.951
villager never got to it. Black Market... corrupt 
South Vietnamese officials, corrupt American

33:04.548 --> 33:10.835
officials. One of the biggest trucking companies 
in South Vietnam was a share owner that was Lady

33:12.337 --> 33:18.103
Bird Johnson. Not once did they ever get ambushed 
or hit because they were paying their taxes to the

33:18.684 --> 33:27.313
D.C. that the American soldiers were fighting. If 
you put an American truck out there and paint that

33:27.333 --> 33:33.660
sucker OD and let it go down the road by itself, 
it'll never get to where it's going. But them

33:34.872 --> 33:39.098
18-wheelers, they'd get on the highway and no 
trouble. Go straight into wherever they wanted to

33:39.859 --> 33:41.361
go. Makes you think, doesn't it? First time I went 
to South Vietnam, I was doing it for God and country

33:45.546 --> 33:50.733
and Mom's apple pie. I'd been a soldier all my life, 
had been brought up in it, believed in my country,

33:50.753 --> 33:59.585
believed in my leaders and everything. If you 
would have cut me, I would have bled O.D., That's

34:02.817 --> 34:06.822
how hardcore I was about the military. About 
halfway through my tour, I changed all that. And

34:09.365 --> 34:12.108
after that, it just became survival. I got out of 
the armored cab unit. I went into long-range

34:13.730 --> 34:16.573
recon. I didn't like working with American units.

34:23.341 --> 34:28.647
I'd take five men and go out and stay four days and 
come back in three and go out four days and come back

34:23.341 --> 34:28.647
in three. And that's how I did the rest of my tour. I 
did a lot of work with Charlotte Company, 75th

34:31.420 --> 34:40.971
Ranger Battalion, and Major Hudson was probably 
one of the finest officers that I've ever met. And

34:40.991 --> 34:45.416
that's the way he fought his war, and I liked it that 
way. It was things that I'd been trained for all my

34:45.436 --> 34:51.483
life, was counterinsurgency and ambushes, and I 
liked it. And I did a good job at it. I'm here. Was

34:55.113 --> 35:00.559
there any one event or was it a community event that 
made you change your way of thinking? It was seeing

35:00.579 --> 35:24.006
a number of things, the pacification program, it 
was seeing armed soldiers and young men of

35:00.579 --> 35:24.006
military age riding around on motorcycles, 
pimping for girls, and it was seeing 18 and

35:00.579 --> 35:24.006
19-year-old kids getting killed when they were 
American kids.

35:27.800 --> 35:28.180
Stop. Take a break.

35:35.108 --> 35:37.070
Where did you go to do your long range cruise? Well, 
I'd already done most of it. I did it in Europe. I did

35:43.678 --> 35:44.799
it at Fort Hood. I guess I got started at Fort Hood. 
They had an H-13 there and I couldn't find anybody

35:49.024 --> 35:57.013
dumb enough to fly around with a pilot because it 
was a helicopter It was getting to be new, and they

35:57.888 --> 36:07.883
were using it for artillery fire, but now they were 
going to use it for recon. So I got started there,

36:07.903 --> 36:19.901
and we'd fly real low and slow, and I'd call back 
coordinates and stuff on where I saw the enemy and

36:07.903 --> 36:19.901
everything, and I'd just artillery fire for it. 
This is when I was a buck sergeant. And when I got to

36:24.127 --> 36:27.152
Fort Bliss, I made staff sergeant. So when I was in 
Vietnam the first time, I was Staff Sergeant E6. I

36:31.618 --> 36:43.859
was supposed to be a squad leader, but my platoon 
sergeant, as soon as we got to Vietnam, went up to

36:31.618 --> 36:43.859
Brigade Headquarters as an operational 
sergeant. Instead of bringing in an E7, a new guy

36:43.879 --> 36:50.170
that didn't know all the guys in the platoon, they 
just sort of moved me over there. and let me as a

36:51.010 --> 37:00.840
staff sergeant E6 and I took one of the buck 
sergeants that I knew that did real good and put him

36:51.010 --> 37:00.840
in as a squad leader. And that's how I got that. But I 
started long range patrols in Germany.

37:07.147 --> 37:12.492
Went through a mini ranger course for the 10th 
special forces of Bantos. Took my can platoon down

37:13.654 --> 37:17.878
there really. infusion program where you can take 
a platoon down there from different units in

37:18.128 --> 37:48.068
Europe and go through a dirty uh yeah it was dirty 
but it was a 30-day course on land navigation

37:18.128 --> 37:48.068
ambushes and recon patrols and things like that 
like the special forces did and that was a lot of fun

37:18.128 --> 37:48.068
and I just wanted to get away from I wanted to be in 
Vietnam and I wanted to I wanted to be a good soldier

37:18.128 --> 37:48.068
and I wanted to do the things that I was trained to do 
I felt handicapped a lot of times. Vietnam was a

37:52.153 --> 37:53.955
squad leader's war. It was the buck sergeant's war 
and the staff sergeant's war. And by the time you

37:58.860 --> 38:08.889
called people up to get permission to do this or 
move here or can we put fire on this area or

37:58.860 --> 38:08.889
something like that, hey, the gooks were already 
gone. So you wasted a lot of time. But when you were

38:11.792 --> 38:16.637
on long-range patrols, you were given specific 
missions. and the majority of them was just recon,

38:17.596 --> 38:32.095
find large troop movements and stuff like that, 
and then call it back in, and then they'd bring out a

38:17.596 --> 38:32.095
large American force to make contact. Sometimes 
we would maintain visual contact. Sometimes

38:35.820 --> 38:45.493
they'd say, well, we don't have anybody that's 
free to operate at this time, so you need to

38:35.820 --> 38:45.493
interdict and either ambush if it's not too large, 
or call in an air strike or an artillery fire. You

38:48.970 --> 38:53.235
know, and do as much damage as you can and then get 
out of the area. So those were the kind of things

38:53.255 --> 38:54.877
that I liked.

38:58.501 --> 39:01.344
It was more of an individual thing. Were you still 
around duck foe when you changed? Yeah, we

39:04.728 --> 39:07.151
operated out of duck foe. Most every battalion had 
a squad of guys that did their recon stuff for them.

39:16.068 --> 39:24.241
The division had a alert platoon and they did long 
range patrol. And then you had, each division had a

39:25.904 --> 39:33.455
company of rangers that they used. And Charlie 
County 75th Rangers was the one that I remember

39:35.138 --> 39:43.932
best because of Major Hudson in 1771. But it got you 
away from the regular fighting. You didn't sit up

39:50.516 --> 39:57.505
in a foxhole all night worrying about the GI to your 
right and what he was going to do. If you had the

39:57.985 --> 40:04.914
right guys in your team, you knew exactly what they 
were going to do. The platoon that I took to

40:04.934 --> 40:15.387
Vietnam, I had 23 men wounded and I had three men 
killed out of 11 months and 16 days the first time I

40:04.934 --> 40:15.387
was in Vietnam. And I trained every one of those 
guys. The three guys that got killed,

40:18.733 --> 40:31.571
if you send a whole unit together into South 
Vietnam, then that means if you leave them all

40:18.733 --> 40:31.571
together, they all have to rotate at the same time. 
So right after we got in country, we had to infuse

40:38.519 --> 40:42.364
15% of the organization. So that meant that we had 
to get rid of 15% of our people and send them to

40:42.524 --> 40:49.132
different units. And my three

40:49.373 --> 40:54.058
guys ended up, they went down to the 11th Cav. And 
that's where they got killed, with the 11th Cav.

40:56.261 --> 40:58.924
They didn't get killed in the 11th Cav. They had a 
lot of guys wounded, you know. And that was all.

41:04.709 --> 41:10.316
While you were there the first time, were there any 
problems with spraying and drugs or alcohol? Were

41:10.336 --> 41:13.460
there any about short time or anything like that? 
No, everybody had a short time on their calendar.

41:17.686 --> 41:25.516
That was just something that the first couple of 
weeks you really didn't pay any attention to

41:17.686 --> 41:25.516
something like that because, you know, you were 
doing a tour of duty. It was just like 13 months in

41:25.536 --> 41:34.007
going to Korea or a two-year tour of duty in Germany 
because we hadn't done any fighting yet. But once

41:34.983 --> 41:39.630
the fighting started, everybody started as 
short-timers, countenance. I don't remember any

41:42.214 --> 41:48.824
fracking in the 11th and 15th Brigades, not the 
time that I was with them, 67 or 68. These are the

41:49.305 --> 41:54.192
same officers and men that had trained together in 
Hawaii on a whole. So there was a lot of respect and

41:54.853 --> 41:59.541
admiration for each other.

42:02.065 --> 42:03.707
When we were back at the fire base, We didn't get 
much beer. Certainly wasn't any hard liquor. We

42:10.581 --> 42:12.885
had an opportunity to drink two or three beers. I 
think we were supposed to be issuing two beers per

42:12.905 --> 42:15.689
man per day. You didn't see that out in the bush. So 
when you got back to the fire base, there would be a

42:20.496 --> 42:26.606
connex container full of about 40 cases of beer. So 
in three days, you could drink about 40 cases of

42:26.626 --> 42:29.290
beer. But in those three days, you're supposed to 
get issued new fatigues, clean your weapons,

42:29.827 --> 42:39.096
check them out, drill them again, draw new 
equipment and supplies. You know, just sort of

42:39.677 --> 42:44.982
stand down and rest when you're getting ready to go 
back out again.

42:48.285 --> 42:50.548
You can smell pot a mile away. And I can walk into a 
barracks and... It can have four floors to it and I

42:55.915 --> 43:01.822
can tell you almost what room it is on the fourth 
floor of the smoking pot. Just with my nose. So, if I

43:04.125 --> 43:09.892
can smell it, the VC can smell it. We didn't use 
cologne and we didn't use a lot of other things.

43:12.916 --> 43:17.061
Now, we smoked cigarettes and some of us chewed 
tobacco. I know that's a bad habit, but that's

43:17.081 --> 43:22.147
better than lighting up a cigarette at night. I 
don't do it anymore, but I did then. I didn't see

43:25.649 --> 43:27.291
much pot smoking. Really didn't know at the time 
what it was. I do know that if you wanted to stay up

43:31.715 --> 43:42.486
for three days in a row, that you could get a big old 
red pill from the medic. And it turned out later

43:42.506 --> 43:44.888
that I found out it was speed. I guess I was pretty 
naive when it came to drugs and things like that.

43:48.993 --> 43:52.416
Because in my military service, we just never had 
that. Turned out that the first driver for my PC

43:53.189 --> 43:58.737
that I had while I was still with the 11th Infantry 
Brigade was from Haight-Ashbury.

44:01.501 --> 44:19.045
So he knew all about those drugs, and he educated me 
in what this is and what was that, and didn't do it in

44:01.501 --> 44:19.045
my presence, because he knew that I was one of the 
guys that believed that you had to be 100% all the

44:01.501 --> 44:19.045
time, or you wasn't going to come out of it. So I 
guess it was there. I didn't see any pothead

44:23.210 --> 44:27.236
bunkers like they had in that movie Catoon. And I 
didn't see a lot of guys drunk. It was just

44:29.640 --> 44:35.448
something you didn't do because you never knew 
when you were going to get hit. You could drink a

44:37.591 --> 44:39.554
couple of beers and not get drunk. Still enjoy the 
beers in the cool of the evening and smoke your

44:39.995 --> 44:46.144
cigarette before the sun went down. Now in 1771,

44:52.657 --> 45:09.101
You know, you have to set that whole thing up 
because there was GIs that went to Vietnam that

44:52.657 --> 45:09.101
were geared to fight, and all of a sudden, in 1771, 
the war's standing down as far as the American GI is

44:52.657 --> 45:09.101
concerned, so they don't really let him get out 
there in the bush anymore. I went to the 4th Entry

45:09.862 --> 45:18.955
Division, which I considered a national guard 
outfit, and for a regular Army sergeant to say

45:09.862 --> 45:18.955
something like that, that's terrible. But I 
thought the 4th Entry Division was the rear end of

45:18.975 --> 45:22.360
the Army, I was lucky enough, I went to the first of 
the 14th Cav, which was the Cav Squadron that they

45:24.230 --> 45:32.460
had. And so that got me a little bit closer back to 
the people that I knew. But while I was in Repo

45:36.885 --> 45:41.770
Depot, there was a sergeant there that had just 
come out. He was coming back home to retire with 20

45:42.651 --> 45:46.456
years of service. He was the first sergeant, and he 
was walking down the street, just about dark. This

45:52.126 --> 45:57.113
was right outside the Red Bull Depot because when 
you come in, you go out at the same place. And this

45:57.133 --> 46:11.573
was then on K. I put just north of what they call the 
golf course area where they used to have all their

45:57.133 --> 46:11.573
helicopters sitting there for the

45:57.133 --> 46:11.573
first air camp. They left and we went in, the 4th 
Infantry Division went in there and took over

46:12.574 --> 46:16.680
their AO. There's a big mountain right there on the 
edge of it. Anyway, this first sergeant was

46:19.682 --> 46:25.327
walking down the street, and some black guy 
stepped out high on dope and put 20 rounds in him.

46:26.488 --> 46:27.889
Killed him right there in the middle of the street. 
Well, they walked over, and the MPs come, and they

46:28.490 --> 46:33.414
handcuffed the black guy. And they took him to Bung 
Town. And you know the guy got 10 to 15 years in

46:35.896 --> 46:40.020
labor. He wasn't responsible for his actions 
because he was high on dope. They should have shot

46:43.844 --> 46:47.747
the son of a bitch right there and saved everybody 
some money I saw a 23-year-old captain, a company

46:48.503 --> 47:04.177
commander, stepped out of his orderly room one 
morning and was cutting half a machine gun, okay,

46:48.503 --> 47:04.177
by a black soldier that was on dope. And what had 
happened is they had a hooch that this young West

47:06.319 --> 47:13.105
Point captain was going to break up. And they had 
got word about it the night before, so the next

47:14.026 --> 47:17.329
morning, When he stepped out of his armory room, 
they killed him. We took a M48A1 tank down there and

47:19.928 --> 47:33.864
stuck the gun to through the door of the hooch and 
told those, I think there was anywhere from 10 to 15

47:19.928 --> 47:33.864
guys in there, and they were all laughing and 
joking. You know, did you see him fall? Did you see

47:35.106 --> 47:36.387
him jerk around? That kind of thing. And we said, 
there's a 90-millimeter HE round in this gun to.

47:43.456 --> 47:47.080
And you people have about five seconds to come out 
of there And they came out with their hands over

47:47.870 --> 47:50.995
their heads. They took them all to Bunktown.
