WEBVTT

00:01.280 --> 00:01.881
you with? Well, almost anything. Many of them had 
their own big paddles, like a baseball bat that

00:04.865 --> 00:10.773
they smoothed off. We were supposed to get them to 
sign a paddle in Christmas. So I took a board about

00:17.662 --> 00:25.192
so long and made it in the shape of a fish and got them 
to sign it. And a lot of them thought that was the

00:26.774 --> 00:30.679
paddle I was supposed to be paddling with, and it 
wasn't. So they gave the wrong impression that I

00:31.115 --> 00:35.619
was getting a small paddle. So we got that 
straightened out. But I did keep that fish paddle

00:39.103 --> 00:43.166
signed for a long time. And then it disappeared. As 
you move around, you can do these

00:44.848 --> 00:56.259
things. What else have we left out that We left any 
people out? Well, let me think now. Who are some

01:07.131 --> 01:15.563
people, you mentioned Mr. Hensel, who are some 
other people for whom you feel gratitude for your

01:07.131 --> 01:15.563
A&M years? My A&M years, of course. Your student 
years. Student years. All right. Charles Ratoon

01:23.413 --> 01:27.058
Brooks in architecture I like very much. He's the 
only one that didn't treat me like a foreigner over

01:27.781 --> 01:31.166
there. We were taking architecture courses as 
landscape art students, and a lot of them didn't

01:31.847 --> 01:37.756
think we had to mention being over there. But he 
didn't. And he was such a wonderful teacher that I

01:39.919 --> 01:47.209
took everything he had, every course he had, in 
history of architecture. And then we had a senior

01:48.031 --> 01:51.055
inspection trip. in the class of 37-38, I was in 
class 37. We went on a bus trip to Natchez in New

01:58.991 --> 02:10.703
Orleans, and Mr. Brooks went along with us to 
lecture us on architecture. And we didn't have

02:12.365 --> 02:21.514
enough money to pay for the bus, so two ladies from 
Hearn went with Oh, my. And we had quite a time. But

02:25.993 --> 02:35.387
we got to Natchez, and I'm telling you now, we went 
to the first Confederate ball at Natchez,

02:25.993 --> 02:35.387
Mississippi. And Mrs. Grace Grafton Miller, 
that's that thing that I went to. And so we went to

02:44.528 --> 03:02.258
the first Confederate ball I had, and somebody 
decided that at the Grand March, these boys in

02:44.528 --> 03:02.258
uniforms should be in it. So I went. So you Aggies 
were part of the?

03:08.845 --> 03:14.172
Confederate Ball Grand March in Natchez, 
Mississippi for the Natchez Pilgrimage. And I

03:15.193 --> 03:19.980
remember that we were riding quad trains on the bus 
for entertainment. Brooks wrote one. It was

03:23.725 --> 03:26.128
raining when we left. He says, I thought we were 
rather dippy, starting from Mississippi, with

03:26.228 --> 03:31.214
the weather so drippy. But after Natchez and the 
romance of Natchez, there's nothing that matches

03:32.055 --> 03:36.221
Natchez. Weepy. So years later, I'm at a National 
Council of Garden Clubs meeting in Biloxi, and I go

03:38.360 --> 03:57.396
up to, this lady's there, the receiver of the ward, 
so I went up there to talk to her, and I says, I said,

03:38.360 --> 03:57.396
do you remember that bunch of cadets? And I 
remember that little poem, I said, we wrote some

03:58.477 --> 04:03.081
quatrains, and here's one of them. So I wrote, I 
recited that poem that I won at, and she says, I want

04:08.566 --> 04:12.151
you to write that down. She said, if you'll let us 
come back to Natchez any time, I'll put you up in the

04:13.152 --> 04:18.139
big house. I'd have to get back in the big house, but 
you'd have to climb a ladder to get in the bed in that

04:19.821 --> 04:24.988
thing. But they got us a date with one of those bell, 
those skirts, and we got to see the inside of a

04:25.649 --> 04:37.645
house, and one of us, They have the living quarters 
and the show quarters. And that was quite an

04:42.262 --> 04:46.487
experience.

04:46.507 --> 04:52.475
I had some rather interesting experiences along 
the line, but they've all been fun. Let's see. I see

04:53.236 --> 04:56.560
in my notes I didn't ask about Bonfire. What was 
Bonfire like when you were an undergraduate? I was

04:59.564 --> 05:05.151
trash on the drill field, on the present drill 
field. And where did y'all gather that trash? All

05:07.599 --> 05:09.181
over the county. People would come down the next 
morning and pick out what they thought was there

05:09.201 --> 05:13.867
and take it back home. And if they didn't get it back 
the next night, just a pile of trash is all right.

05:24.519 --> 05:30.126
Now, I've understood that there's usually a 
privy, an outhouse. uh... whose job was it to grab

05:30.899 --> 05:58.408
the outhouse and

05:30.899 --> 05:58.408
and that would not be donated willing that would 
have been acquired uh...

05:30.899 --> 05:58.408
what else if we left out of your student days

05:30.899 --> 05:58.408
still i had more from the freshman Just because I 
wanted to. I wasn't afraid of the sophomores. I

06:02.951 --> 06:07.415
didn't know they were piss-heads, as we called 
them. And I wasn't afraid of them. And I didn't

06:10.058 --> 06:11.360
care. I wasn't afraid of them, but I didn't flaunt 
it in their face. I made them learn everything they

06:15.945 --> 06:19.468
got out of me. But it's all fun. If you take all that 
in fun, it's great. And I had tried to be a good

06:29.219 --> 06:38.953
freshman, and apparently I was, because I got to be 
a corporal my sophomore year. And didn't

06:39.614 --> 06:40.956
everybody make corporal? I was glad to be a squad 
leader, and that was part of the thing. But anyway,

06:45.462 --> 06:53.153
I think I had more fun as a freshman at A&M than any 
freshman ever had. You see, I lived in a room over

06:53.173 --> 06:56.037
there. But I was supposed to put a note on my door if I 
went to the library or wherever I went. And you're

07:02.757 --> 07:04.399
supposed to get somebody to sign that. So finally 
they said, well, you just sign it and go on. So I did.

07:08.525 --> 07:09.908
So I went anywhere I wanted. I went all over that 
campus. And finally, some people came over. Some

07:18.281 --> 07:22.587
upper class people came over to study with me. 
Thought I was going to make a... Good grade. Never

07:26.484 --> 07:28.666
will forget Dr. Humber as long as I live. In 
genetics. I was taking genetics for the last term

07:30.968 --> 07:34.432
of my sophomore year. And we were going to have a 
first big quiz. And for some reason, he decided

07:40.958 --> 07:45.242
he'd read out people who had an A in the course. And 
he read my name out. I had the exam. He handed my

07:52.109 --> 07:54.812
paper back to me and said, you better get busy. I'd 
gotten mixed up on the first question, and instead

07:55.720 --> 08:01.789
of leaving it going on, I just stayed with it. I made 
35 on the first one. So I worked all... I just worked

08:06.575 --> 08:23.820
like the devil the rest of the years to get that down 
to a C. And I finally got it to a C. Boy, what a... And

08:06.575 --> 08:23.820
we had to count fruit flies up on top of the whole...

08:25.589 --> 08:34.501
Well, the animal science building, the animal 
urban building, that was across the quadrangle

08:25.589 --> 08:34.501
from ag engineering. We counted fruit flies until 
I thought we'd go crazy. But anyway, that was part

08:38.886 --> 08:41.930
of the genetics. Genetics was a good course, but I 
sure didn't flub on it. I made it through, but I

08:47.097 --> 08:52.123
thought it was one of the hardest courses I had. 
Next to soil. Soil was a good course. It was a hard

08:54.166 --> 08:54.887
course. Dr. Jones, he's a good teacher.

09:01.852 --> 09:04.334
OK, the last question for this morning session. As 
you look back, what did it mean to your life that you

09:05.295 --> 09:12.982
attended Texas A&M? Everything. Once an Aggie, 
always an Aggie. And of course, I discovered

09:17.986 --> 09:22.030
things there I'd never seen or heard of in my life. 
When you grow up with that many women, You're glad

09:25.107 --> 09:26.409
to get away.

09:30.254 --> 09:36.964
For the first time in my life, I was with a man that I 
respected and loved and enjoyed being with.

09:38.727 --> 09:41.371
I just thought that first year was just wonderful. 
Let's start again. Bob, would you summarize in a

09:52.478 --> 10:05.876
comparatively short time, your experience 
between 1940 and when you come back to A&M in 68.

10:05.936 --> 10:10.942
Yes, it was in Oklahoma under one president. Well, 
but you went away to the war, had a distinguished

10:10.962 --> 10:14.467
war record. Under distinguished. I got shot out a 
few times. I got wounded three times, lost the leg

10:19.233 --> 10:22.317
and sent home. stepped on a mine 1.30 one morning, 
blew it off, laid there 27 hours before they picked

10:22.955 --> 10:32.089
me up, and rolled me off as killed in action. But 
then I didn't get killed. Well, then I see. You

10:40.782 --> 10:41.683
worked at Baylor. Well, I went to work at Baylor. 
First in Baylor was a godsend. I didn't know

10:47.652 --> 10:50.076
whether I could work a day or an hour They didn't 
care. They wanted somebody to fix that campus with

10:51.618 --> 10:56.703
Centennial and persuaded Patton Neff to hire me. 
And there was nothing between Waco Hall and Patton

10:57.764 --> 11:07.273
Neff Hall except a sea of mud and two walks. So I 
worked out the plan like I told you. He said, build

11:10.196 --> 11:12.358
them, Rocker, build them. I didn't have anybody to 
count them. Anyway, that worked out. We put the

11:17.562 --> 11:21.125
grass back, and they hadn't had grass before. Then 
Baylor, Oklahoma, wanted me to come there. And I

11:26.710 --> 11:34.156
told them I'd be glad to come, but I couldn't come 
until June the 1st, because I'd promised Baylor

11:26.710 --> 11:34.156
I'd stay there until the centennial started. And 
they said, we'll wait. So they did. And that was 20

11:37.639 --> 11:41.242
very wonderful, happy, professional years. Our 
kids were all raised there. Dr. and Ms. Cross were

11:47.853 --> 11:50.697
just the wonderful people to work for. I

11:50.717 --> 11:58.428
think I told you about the trees. I

11:58.448 --> 12:11.207
mentioned later that I had a project with the 
garden clubs to plant a million trees a year in the

11:58.448 --> 12:11.207
51 organizations they had. And they would make a 
million trees. What am I saying? Two million

12:16.775 --> 12:17.556
trees. A million trees. When they planted, they 
got busy and planted 108 million. They really did a

12:25.813 --> 12:27.355
job on trees. But we had people planting trees that 
had never seen or heard of how to plant a tree. And a

12:35.085 --> 12:37.328
lot of them discovered new terms in trees. It was 
good. Now let's see, what did you... Excuse me.

12:45.980 --> 12:47.442
How did you... come to A&M. Who made the contact? 
Tom Cherry came up to see me. He came up to see the

12:55.490 --> 13:01.879
high-rise dorms on the campus and discovered what 
we called a small test garden. And Earl Rudder had

13:02.860 --> 13:12.994
told, no, the board had told Earl Rudder they 
wanted flowers back on the campus and he could find

13:02.860 --> 13:12.994
them and they'd hire him. So Ms. Rudder put my name 
in the pot after we went to All right, how did you and

13:17.240 --> 13:18.842
Mrs. Rudder, how were you acquainted? I was 
president of the Southwest Chapter of the

13:20.463 --> 13:31.334
American Society of Landscape Architects, and we 
had invited Ms. Lady Bird Johnson down to receive a

13:20.463 --> 13:31.334
citation. She couldn't come to get it, so Mrs. 
Rudder was going to receive it for her. And we sat by

13:34.998 --> 13:36.419
each other all night. She went back home and said, 
Earl, I found you a man. And to make it brief, they

13:40.143 --> 13:44.648
hired me. She put my name in the box. All right, I'm 
not going to ask about salary any other time. What

13:49.143 --> 13:51.506
was your beginning salary at A&M then? Oh, that's 
why I want to know, $20,000.

13:58.053 --> 14:00.676
And that's 1968. 68. See, I had just done the World 
Fan Project in New York for the governor of

14:01.017 --> 14:14.012
Oklahoma, and it turned out all right. And... But 
they called me, and I went down for an interview.

14:25.973 --> 14:28.716
I mean, Morris Bloodworth called me to come down. 
And anyway, to make a long story short, they

14:29.737 --> 14:43.052
offered me $20,000, and I talked to Mr. Rutter, I 
mean, Dr. Cross, and Dr. Cross said, Don't look

14:43.488 --> 14:44.329
back. Says, I'm resigning. He says, July the 1st. 
And the man they hired has never been in education.

14:51.675 --> 14:56.679
He says, whoa, we don't know what you're going to 
do. And Mrs. Cross, I had never seen her anyway, but

14:56.699 --> 15:05.486
dressed ready to go out on the street. This woman, 
this is when I showed up in negligee. I never saw

15:10.891 --> 15:13.393
anything but a negligee and barefooted. And that 
was not the image of a college friend's wife. And I

15:17.206 --> 15:19.168
knew I couldn't take that. I was scared to death of 
that woman. When you came to A&M in 1968,

15:21.350 --> 15:31.038
what was your assigned duty? I was to be a professor 
of floriculture and have charge of the campus. I

15:39.445 --> 15:42.368
was going to be the landscape architect on the, not 
at the campus planning committee, but I ran into

15:43.006 --> 15:52.861
Paul Stevens, which if any plan, a campus plan was 
done, he was going to do it. He bucked me on

15:53.582 --> 15:57.128
everything I tried to do all the way. It was bad. The 
greatest accomplishment I did was in the

15:59.011 --> 16:08.044
academics at his request, at Dr. Rodgers' 
request. You see, horticulture, floriculture,

16:12.520 --> 16:16.544
was a section of soil and crop sciences. And it had 
been a flourishing department of agriculture

16:17.666 --> 16:21.710
before the war. But things happened. The war 
happened. It deteriorated a lot. And I was asked to

16:29.759 --> 16:34.264
rebuild.

16:36.026 --> 16:39.169
Let me get it back in focus.

16:40.634 --> 16:48.564
I was called over to Dr. Bloodworth's office, he 
was the head of the department, and said, they want

16:40.634 --> 16:48.564
you to take over floriculture in the morning. And I 
said, okay, but my Lord, Mr. DeWorth knew about it.

16:55.432 --> 16:56.253
Do you remember DeWorth? Oh, Lord, that was a man. 
He hated girls, first of all. He didn't like

17:02.241 --> 17:04.023
students. And he would let some of them come in. 
Well, anyway... I said, well, does DeWerth know

17:10.975 --> 17:12.737
about that? He says, yes, he'll come over at 5. I 
said, let me get out of here. So I went home. The next

17:20.446 --> 17:28.976
morning, he came in, and he laid 50-some-odd keys 
down on the desk without all the numbers and

17:20.446 --> 17:28.976
identification taken off of them. He said, if 
you're going to run this thing, you're going to

17:28.996 --> 17:32.460
need the keys for it. So I called Bloodworth. I 
said, I believe he called me. He says, how's it

17:38.327 --> 17:39.128
going? I says, it's already started. I said, I've 
got 50-some-odd keys laid down on my desk. All the

17:44.512 --> 17:46.715
numbers and identifications have been filed off 
of them. And he said, oh, I can take care of that real

17:47.737 --> 17:50.681
quick. He picked up the phone and called physical, 
and he said, were all the locks and keys changed on

17:51.643 --> 17:57.512
every lock of the horticulture? Oh, well, bye. And 
then I told the secretary that they're changing

18:00.837 --> 18:06.927
all the locks on the . She says, no, I know who has the 
key over here anyway. I said, that's right. I said,

18:11.085 --> 18:15.049
I have been permitted to have a key in two years that 
I've been here. And he wouldn't let me have a key,

18:15.951 --> 18:17.432
would he? So as a result, he didn't get a key, and he 
had to pay a deposit. And it just killed his soul. He

18:25.062 --> 18:31.970
would not pay for a deposit on the keys, any of the 
keys, because they were his greenhouses and all

18:25.062 --> 18:31.970
that. And I had not been allowed in the greenhouses 
for years, I mean, the times I'd been there.

18:38.422 --> 18:45.829
Anyway, it came that everybody had to put up a 
deposit and get the total security, and they had to

18:38.422 --> 18:45.829
check them out and put their security up. Well, 
that didn't go over too good, but anyway, it went

18:46.510 --> 18:49.553
that way. We had control of the department, and we 
got, apparently I did what they wanted done,

18:49.913 --> 19:06.008
because they called me in January and said, now, 
you've taken over Floriculture, we want you to

18:49.913 --> 19:06.008
take over all of Horticulture. And I said, now 
look, I'm the last man hired, low man on the totem

19:08.662 --> 19:11.827
pole. I'm not a PhD. You have nine PhDs up there. But 
I said, it's not an academic problem. It's a middle

19:18.957 --> 19:21.121
management problem. You've got to tell people 
what they're going to do and do it. So we redid all

19:25.447 --> 19:28.311
the horticulture. We had 37 majors at Haskell at 
the time I got over there. That's not enough to

19:33.940 --> 19:35.702
teach any class. We had the practitioners 
everywhere. Seven years later, I also was working

19:38.243 --> 19:43.948
on the master planning committee and knew when the 
buildings were coming. And between Perry

19:44.969 --> 19:52.737
Atkinson and myself, we got $18 million for a new 
horticulture building. Happened to be at the

19:53.778 --> 19:55.759
right place at the right time again. And we

19:56.700 --> 20:02.446
had 540 majors. That's actually that. So we went 
from no department, or no section, not even a

20:05.530 --> 20:21.754
viable section, to a full-fledged department of 
horticulture, and a new building, and the buddy

20:05.530 --> 20:21.754
Ben's request of $2 million. Again, I said I had to 
be in the right place at the right time, and knew

20:22.856 --> 20:26.882
what we had to do. And I didn't ask anybody. I would 
come over there, and I said, I said, now, I'll do

20:34.184 --> 20:37.568
this job. I know what you want done. But unless 
those nine PhDs agree to it, I'm going to be the

20:39.650 --> 20:44.835
chief paper shuffler. I don't want any part of it. 
So all but one agreed. By the way, OK, except one.

20:52.743 --> 20:53.904
And he wasn't going to agree. So they said, you 
either agree to let Rutgers do the paperwork, or

20:54.565 --> 21:00.211
you look for a new job. So he stayed. I didn't work as 
hard in my life on anything as I did that. And we got

21:09.174 --> 21:16.020
the new building, we got Buddy Benz to grant, and 
the endowed chair and floor culture. And again, I

21:17.041 --> 21:21.686
said, had I not come back to the NM, we'd never heard 
of Buddy Benz. But that's, again, being in the

21:23.688 --> 21:31.596
right place at the right time, and moving, not just 
sitting still, and moving out. Now, so as an

21:31.964 --> 21:39.153
academic, you were the department head and 
reported to the dean of agriculture. We became a

21:40.154 --> 21:41.236
department. No. Oh. No, no. We built it from a very 
small section of 37 majors to a complete

21:44.199 --> 21:50.587
department. But they thought they had to have a PhD 
to hit it. So they had a nationwide search. And we

21:56.555 --> 22:00.520
got a man who had not been in the academic field 
Since he graduated from

22:01.512 --> 22:11.943
Clemson, I believe, 18 years before, had not been 
in an academic environment. He did not know what

22:12.624 --> 22:15.807
even was up in academics. And his main area of 
interest was garlic. So did you. But anyway, to

22:21.033 --> 22:25.938
make a long story short, we got a man whose interest 
was in garlic. And he didn't know what to do. Dr.

22:30.368 --> 22:41.924
Bloodworth, I mean, Dr.

22:30.368 --> 22:41.924
myself and Dr. in food science, there were three of 
us who were senior professors. And we told him we'd

22:42.765 --> 22:45.088
do anything we wanted to do. We'd be glad to help him 
do anything he wanted to do. And so he'd call us in,

22:49.174 --> 22:54.661
and every time we'd make a recommendation, he'd do 
the opposite. And every time he got his tail in a

22:55.302 --> 22:57.525
crack. And I mean... We had the 540 majors, and we 
lost 200 majors the first year he was there. I never

23:06.123 --> 23:13.753
worked as hard in my life to get a department 
rebuilt and going in my life. See, it didn't

23:14.133 --> 23:18.519
degenerate the way it did, go down. But that's the 
hardest work I did for the president. And it all

23:23.685 --> 23:26.228
became, and you see, The first thing you knew, we 
went over fish-positive girls. So Kunkel called

23:31.114 --> 23:34.599
me down and says, what are you going to do with all 
these girls? I said, we're going to teach them.

23:37.242 --> 23:38.244
Well, what are you going to teach them? They don't 
want to be biochemists. I said, no, no, they sure

23:40.407 --> 23:41.989
don't, Dean. There's a whole other world out there 
besides biochemistry, and we're going to explore

23:42.609 --> 23:47.456
it. I said, we'll start off with fly arranging 
first and get the buddy bins and books going. And

23:54.085 --> 23:55.487
that's what we did. And I But I have never in my life 
worked this hard to get a program re-established

23:57.022 --> 24:05.751
and go in and I did that one. And then we got this man, 
the garlic man, that finally they wouldn't even

24:06.411 --> 24:13.699
give him an army. One day he says, can you stand on 
your head? I said, stand on my head? Well, why would

24:17.563 --> 24:18.664
I want to stand on my head? Well, it's good for you. 
It makes you think. And so he just stood on his head.

24:23.649 --> 24:25.250
And I thought, my god. It's the best man to go down in 
the industry. And it stands on its head, we were

24:27.515 --> 24:29.458
dead ducks. That's all there is to it. And that's 
what happened. All right, now, in addition to the

24:32.723 --> 24:39.633
academic task, you were the chief campus planter. 
To whom did you report in that responsibility?

24:44.640 --> 24:45.341
That's another story. They wanted me to take it 
over as a part of ground maintenance, I mean a

24:46.102 --> 24:51.210
physical plant. I said, no dice. I said, I can't go 
through 15 people and ever get heard I either am in

24:57.721 --> 25:00.284
charge of the campus or I'm not in charge of it. And 
so I said, OK. And they put me in the end part of my

25:01.025 --> 25:07.574
physical plan. But I had my own budget in Maine. 
First thing I knew, we had no money. We didn't know.

25:14.743 --> 25:16.365
I said, look, I can't go up to this anymore. I'm 
sorry. I'm either running this thing or I'm not

25:17.587 --> 25:19.309
running it. And I'm not going to be here running a 
physical plan that knows not a damn thing about

25:20.230 --> 25:26.378
what's going on outside space. He's concerned 
with inside space. I expect he's equipped to

25:29.963 --> 25:35.149
handle that, but he doesn't know anything about 
outdoor space or how to handle it. That's what it's

25:35.769 --> 25:36.710
all about. I didn't think it easy, but I worked hard 
and got it done the way I wanted it done, but it was

25:36.730 --> 25:43.578
hard. Now, to whom did you report? Tom Cherry? Tom 
Cherry. Describe him as a leader, as an

25:47.081 --> 25:50.745
administrator. Very good. Excellent.

25:55.467 --> 25:59.211
You know, his brother, Bob, would have 
represented us in the legislature. But Tom Cherry

26:00.212 --> 26:03.615
was a gentleman and a scholar from way back. I had no 
trouble with Tom. I would just lay the cards on the

26:07.639 --> 26:11.762
table, and we'd go from there. And

26:12.603 --> 26:17.728
it worked out for them. I think Tom Sherry was one of 
the finest people I ever worked with. Did he give

26:21.890 --> 26:26.657
you any directions, any boundaries? I'd ask him 
for boundaries, and then I'd ask him, for

26:27.959 --> 26:45.485
instance, Clyde Freeman sent me a word one time 
that some student came to interview me about the

26:27.959 --> 26:45.485
ice return on the football field. Well, part of it, 
And I've never been to either request to give a

26:48.050 --> 26:51.916
student an interview in my life. But his henchman, 
I forget his name now, came over and closed the door

26:53.017 --> 27:04.434
back of me and said, who gave you the privilege to 
write a student a story about the AstroTurf? I

27:05.356 --> 27:07.639
said, nobody gave me that thing. I said, that's 
part of the outdoor space I'm taking care of. And I

27:11.565 --> 27:14.670
gave him the story. He says, well, don't do it 
anymore. I said, you're just crazy as hell. If they

27:19.057 --> 27:21.399
want to stir, they're going to get one. And I said, 
that's not the way I was raised, and that's not the

27:23.241 --> 27:26.265
way academic freedom is. I said, don't you or your 
boss know anything about academic freedom? He

27:30.749 --> 27:37.877
didn't reply to that, but they never did like the 
fact that I would take the leeway to do what I was

27:30.749 --> 27:37.877
supposed to do. They wanted me to be under them, and 
I refused to do it. That's the only way I got

27:43.283 --> 27:44.905
anything accomplished. was to just do what I 
thought I was doing and tell him if he didn't like

27:45.678 --> 27:50.084
it, he could go to hell. Now, when you first came, 
first arrived, did you have any clear direction?

27:58.476 --> 28:00.739
Did Mr. Rutter tell you what he wanted done? Yes and 
no. You see, Mr. DeWorth just gave Ms. Rutter hell.

28:10.793 --> 28:12.495
If she wanted a flower, she couldn't have it. He 
didn't go out where the rodents were going. And he

28:17.144 --> 28:20.347
accused her of cutting these rodents off test 
plots. It was just pure hell. And he thought he

28:23.370 --> 28:25.092
could get away. And I didn't have to be told. I saw 
it. After we got to many girls, it was over 4% to 5%

28:29.917 --> 28:35.643
girls, he came in one day. And last year, he was 
there. He was head of this. And I had such a bad year

28:40.167 --> 28:42.590
in my life. Everything I did was wrong. Came in one 
day and said, you're making a big mistake letting

28:44.312 --> 28:48.598
all these girls in here. I said, I'm not letting any 
girls in here. They're taxpayers' daughters, and

28:52.082 --> 28:54.926
they're just welding the fires in May. We're not 
supposed to tell taxpayers they can't send their

28:55.547 --> 28:58.190
kids here. That's the last thing we're going to do. 
Anyway, I had a real rough time, because

29:01.034 --> 29:08.183
everything I did that year was wrong. But I just 
didn't pay attention. I ignored him and he'd grow

29:10.373 --> 29:12.496
on me. I had to. But now regarding Mr. Rudder, did 
you have any direct interaction with him? Yes.

29:22.329 --> 29:23.070
Let me think.

29:26.515 --> 29:35.166
When I came down for an interview, I talked to him, 
and he made me the offer of $20,000 a year and told me

29:26.515 --> 29:35.166
that I'd have charge of the campus. and be a 
professor of floriculture. And as each one grew, I

29:41.347 --> 29:47.053
had to keep pace with them. But the only place I did, 
I think the best thing I ever did academically was

29:47.153 --> 29:57.323
rebuild horticulture into a viable department. 
And I mean, it was a good one. But the first time that

30:01.407 --> 30:05.271
Mr. Garlic showed up and stood on his head, The kids 
dropped that thing like, of course, like nobody in

30:05.943 --> 30:08.906
business. Now, to attract students, what did you 
and your colleagues do to attract more majors?

30:17.936 --> 30:20.579
We talked to everyone that came on campus. I said, I 
don't ever want to see a door closed and some kid

30:20.599 --> 30:25.525
timidly knocking on that door. Because the bottom 
line is, when you don't have any students to teach,

30:26.426 --> 30:31.571
you don't have a job around here. I said, students 
are number one priority at this place. And I want

30:34.675 --> 30:35.916
you to understand, now And I never want to see 
another door closing and somebody timidly

30:36.267 --> 30:39.372
knocking on it. The whole time I stood there. And I 
had one kid that I had to have him try to make an

30:43.318 --> 30:47.746
appointment. I said, no, you keep that door open. 
If he goes up there and knocks on the door, you let

30:49.709 --> 30:51.972
him in. And we opened the door and said, you're 
welcome as you can be. And Roy just jumped.
