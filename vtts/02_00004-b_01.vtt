WEBVTT

00:02.613 --> 00:15.714
you know, beyond their most productive years except maybe Horace Byers, but he had the attitude that we can hire anybody.

00:18.078 --> 00:19.440
At least we ought to go after them.

00:22.525 --> 00:31.174
And I think that's one of the things that changed the culture here was the attitude we could hire people.

00:31.254 --> 00:36.720
And if A&M is going to become a great university, we've got to do that.

00:36.740 --> 00:39.783
I mean, that's our way to become a great university.

00:39.964 --> 00:45.209
Did you get any of that philosophy in that interview with Mr. Rudder?

00:45.770 --> 00:46.090
No.

00:46.110 --> 00:47.612
No, no, no.

00:47.632 --> 00:48.873
You just saw it.

00:48.893 --> 00:50.495
I mean, you saw it in that kind of people.

00:50.635 --> 00:51.756
And he made some...

00:52.681 --> 00:56.645
He either got some bad advice, he made some bad hires.

00:56.665 --> 01:03.873
People that he thought were really great academicians were con men or whatever.

01:03.933 --> 01:04.975
I don't know, they were bust.

01:05.635 --> 01:07.337
And I won't name them, but you know who they were.

01:07.617 --> 01:09.660
Well, who were the key positive ones?

01:10.401 --> 01:12.923
Well, Horace Byers was a key positive, I think.

01:16.327 --> 01:22.654
Van Overby was a key positive.

01:27.545 --> 01:42.850
You're talking too long ago but, and Jack Williams I think followed up on that and of course Jack Williams was more an academician and he would maybe be able to recruit people better than Mr. Rutter.

01:43.651 --> 01:50.903
But anyway I think there was an attitude created back starting with Mr. Rutter and continued with Williams

01:50.883 --> 02:05.758
that we ought to be out looking for the top people and we ought to be trying to bring in people from other universities and we shouldn't put self-imposed limitations on ourselves.

02:06.939 --> 02:19.472
So as a result of that sort of attitude, I think, and making money available so you could compete on, you know, good people.

02:20.026 --> 02:28.299
Now one of the unsung heroes I've always thought during the, in this kind of effort was Wayne Hall.

02:28.439 --> 02:29.701
Yeah, yeah.

02:29.721 --> 02:30.923
Did you have any connection with him?

02:30.943 --> 02:31.283
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

02:31.303 --> 02:40.718
Wayne Hall was, yeah, he was a colleague when he was head of the Department of Plant Sciences and Wayne was a good scientist and he,

02:41.609 --> 02:45.837
He appreciated good science and then he became provost and he was very supportive.

02:46.518 --> 02:56.316
And they made funding available so you could be competitive and they tried to help you recruit top people.

02:57.057 --> 03:01.525
Now you ask if we had gotten any national programs.

03:03.378 --> 03:14.704
Well in the late, when I became department head then I cultivated a friendship with a lot of other department heads because I wanted to recruit

03:15.190 --> 03:18.353
And I wanted people to come here.

03:18.373 --> 03:25.441
So in addition to doing that, I got funds for lecturers, bring lecturers here so they could see what we're trying to do and go back.

03:25.481 --> 03:40.897
But I had a very close relationship developed with Ray Smith, who was head of UC Berkeley in the Moms Department, and Hal Reynolds, who was head of UC Riverside.

03:41.638 --> 03:44.421
Because California, a lot of their,

03:45.565 --> 03:50.471
problems were very similar to ours.

03:50.491 --> 04:15.302
And when Nixon decided that they were going to have to ban DDT, he was under a lot of pressure from the environmentalists to ban DDT, but he was under counter pressure from the farm organizations to

04:15.755 --> 04:17.617
not banned DDT.

04:17.637 --> 04:21.482
So he was sort of caught and damned if he did and damned if he didn't.

04:21.502 --> 04:37.543
But in that process, there was a person in the National Science Foundation that we had worked with on some smaller programs, and he said, I think there's an opportunity

04:38.283 --> 04:55.340
that you could put together a large national program under the auspices of the International Biological Programs, IBP, and you could get White House support if you could develop a program for alternative methods of crop protection.

04:55.360 --> 05:06.130
If DDT is going to go out, then the president's got to say to the farmers, we're going to ban DDT, but in the process we're going to fund a lot of research to develop alternative methods.

05:08.995 --> 05:15.471
So he approached people at Berkeley, not me, but anyway.

05:19.180 --> 05:21.486
Ray Smith called me and he said,

05:22.225 --> 05:32.998
We've got an opportunity to put together a large national program and we've got good support in National Science Foundation where this person worked.

05:33.939 --> 05:39.505
If we could put together a coalition and why don't we do that?

05:40.006 --> 05:42.088
I said, hell, let's do it.

05:42.108 --> 05:43.770
Let's, you know, we can do it.

05:43.971 --> 05:52.080
So we got together four or five people and met in a hotel room at Berkeley and decided we'd put together a large national program.

05:52.060 --> 05:53.262
This is about when?

05:53.502 --> 05:58.509
It was 1970, 71.

05:59.230 --> 06:21.561
And so we developed a scientific program, and then through my relationships with the cotton growers, Mr. Mahon was chairman of the House Appropriations Committee, but he was from Lubbock, Texas, area of the biggest cotton production center of the world.

06:22.672 --> 06:31.802
So we were able to get some people there that he respected to say we got to do something and these guys have got the program.

06:32.263 --> 06:37.168
So whenever their funding comes up, it would be good if you'd help us, which you did.

06:37.809 --> 06:48.240
But anyway, when the White House announced the ban on DDT, they also announced the alternative program

06:49.672 --> 06:52.376
a research program for alternative chemicals.

06:52.416 --> 07:00.427
And that was the largest agricultural research program, a single program, I guess, at its time.

07:01.268 --> 07:04.193
And we had a prime place to play in that.

07:04.293 --> 07:04.974
A&M did.

07:05.755 --> 07:07.497
Who were the other major players?

07:07.517 --> 07:09.520
What schools?

07:10.495 --> 07:23.053
Berkeley and Riverside and A&M, LSU, Michigan State, Cornell,

07:26.628 --> 07:33.401
University of Arkansas was involved in Florida, North Carolina State.

07:33.642 --> 07:35.485
So kind of a Big Ten?

07:35.645 --> 07:36.467
Yeah, yeah.

07:36.667 --> 07:37.629
Eight or ten schools?

07:37.950 --> 07:39.834
Yeah, we had 12 at that time.

07:40.655 --> 07:45.244
So that program was funded for five years and it was very successful.

07:46.895 --> 07:53.164
And it was headed by a fellow at Berkeley named Carl Huffaker.

07:54.326 --> 07:58.712
And then Carl was a scientist and a good one, but he was not a program manager.

07:59.874 --> 08:06.964
And when it ended, then we decided we'd go for a second program, and they asked me to head it.

08:06.984 --> 08:13.594
And we put together one that was even larger called the Consortium Integrated Pest Management, and it went from 19

08:13.574 --> 08:17.880
77 or somewhere at 86.

08:19.603 --> 08:34.023
And as a result of that we had leadership here, had high visibility, had large funding, and it put our department in the center.

08:34.283 --> 08:40.392
And a lot of our guys I had hired who are now five, six, seven, eight years in their career

08:40.372 --> 08:49.863
And as a result of the success of that, we were able to develop a similar program, the one in crops for southern pine beetle.

08:50.744 --> 08:51.665
Leadership was here.

08:52.966 --> 08:59.313
Tom Payne, I recruited for, he's now dean at Columbia, that I recruited from Riverside.

08:59.974 --> 09:02.937
We developed a similar one for mosquitoes.

09:03.136 --> 09:07.600
leadership here of Jim Olsen I had recruited from University of Illinois.

09:08.922 --> 09:18.351
And so we had all these large national projects going on with most of the leadership, project leaders sitting right here.

09:18.812 --> 09:20.193
You're talking about the great successes.

09:20.253 --> 09:25.178
Was there any that didn't work out like y'all had hoped?

09:25.198 --> 09:26.620
So a pretty good batting average.

09:26.900 --> 09:27.020
Yeah.

09:27.621 --> 09:33.126
Accountability was, we had, as part of the program we promised accountability.

09:33.967 --> 09:43.743
that we would demonstrate accountability, and we'd demonstrate that our program would be better than what the farmers are already doing.

09:44.003 --> 09:49.853
So we brought in the ag economists to do those evaluations, and they all worked.

09:49.873 --> 09:55.001
Did the Greenpeace extremists ever become a problem?

09:55.021 --> 09:56.043
No.

09:56.063 --> 09:59.248
Well, we had better support.

10:00.595 --> 10:14.596
out of the environmental group politically than we had out of the people who would be blind with the chemical companies, including some of the national commodity organizations.

10:14.616 --> 10:17.080
Does Mr. Teague deserve any credit?

10:17.100 --> 10:25.152
Mr. Teague was very helpful at the beginning, and of course his career ended before we got finished, and Mr. Mahon,

10:25.638 --> 10:27.362
Both were very, very helpful.

10:28.205 --> 10:28.405
All right.

10:28.425 --> 10:31.353
Did Phil Graham, while he was in the house, did he have any role?

10:31.393 --> 10:34.782
Yes, before he was involved.

10:35.303 --> 10:42.702
Now, while you're doing all this in research, were you still teaching and directing some graduate students?

10:44.993 --> 10:47.676
At the beginning, I was not teaching.

10:48.156 --> 10:52.621
When I became department head, I quit teaching scheduled classes.

10:53.562 --> 10:54.362
What had you been teaching?

10:54.382 --> 10:56.485
I'd been teaching one course a year.

10:56.865 --> 11:03.331
I taught insect ecology, the 400 level course every spring.

11:03.351 --> 11:07.095
But I was hired here as a researcher and experiment station.

11:07.115 --> 11:13.802
So my teaching responsibilities, except for graduate students, always had a large graduate student program.

11:13.782 --> 11:16.186
I had the largest in the department.

11:16.206 --> 11:16.868
About how many?

11:17.128 --> 11:19.793
Well, I'd have 10 to 12.

11:20.655 --> 11:21.897
Masters and PhD?

11:21.957 --> 11:22.859
Mostly PhD.

11:22.879 --> 11:23.320
Mostly.

11:23.340 --> 11:24.842
Yeah.

11:24.863 --> 11:35.402
And so I had a large graduate student program all the time I was here, but I just, I had teaching responsibilities in the spring, one course.

11:35.669 --> 11:44.717
What were your, of those doctoral students, what were some of the topics that they worked on that give you greatest pride now?

11:46.759 --> 11:51.384
Well, one of them just received the Distinguished Teaching Award at the University of Arkansas.

11:52.204 --> 11:53.145
I just wrote him a letter.

11:53.586 --> 11:54.527
Congratulations.

11:54.567 --> 12:04.596
He got it at the commencement the other day, Max Meisch, and he's a mosquito control expert up there now, but he worked on the,

12:05.470 --> 12:08.292
on a cropping problem.

12:09.757 --> 12:12.399
I have several that's gone on and done well.

12:13.060 --> 12:18.404
Did you, were these students from all across the country or were they usually?

12:18.424 --> 12:27.052
No, at the time I was involved mostly, most of our students were from Texas.

12:27.072 --> 12:27.192
Right.

12:27.212 --> 12:35.379
And we had some, we had some drawing power in Louisiana and occasionally Arkansas.

12:35.399 --> 12:39.342
Arkansas sent most of their students to Cornell and Kansas State.

12:39.322 --> 12:59.068
We had quite a few from Oklahoma State, quite a few from Louisiana, and then eventually we started picking them up from some of the schools where we recruited from faculty members like Michigan and Purdue and places like that.

12:59.521 --> 13:02.825
They never got many students out of California, for example.

13:03.345 --> 13:11.754
In the 60s and 70s, was it difficult for a student from out of town to a graduate student to adjust to College Station and A&M?

13:13.456 --> 13:14.657
I don't think so.

13:14.677 --> 13:15.358
I don't think so.

13:15.398 --> 13:28.532
We had a, you know, at that time part was pretty small and faculty members spent a lot of time with students, had them in their homes and,

13:28.867 --> 13:31.210
managed and looked after them.

13:31.230 --> 13:32.893
They had family problems and stuff.

13:32.913 --> 13:34.155
We looked there for our students.

13:35.036 --> 13:38.521
So I think they adjusted pretty well.

13:39.583 --> 13:43.869
Think how much more personal everything was then than now.

13:43.889 --> 13:45.452
Oh yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

13:45.472 --> 13:47.074
I'm telling you, yeah.

13:47.094 --> 13:48.236
Very, very different.

13:48.276 --> 13:52.562
It was, it, the pressure is now on faculty members out here are,

13:53.437 --> 13:54.399
Or hard.

13:54.780 --> 13:55.061
It's hard.

13:55.361 --> 13:56.304
Yes, yes, yes.

13:57.927 --> 13:59.431
Back to Mr. Rudder.

14:00.213 --> 14:08.692
As this program is making progress, did you have the impression that Mr. Rudder was aware of the progress you all were making?

14:10.276 --> 14:12.441
Well, Mr. Rudder died.

14:12.893 --> 14:17.099
About the time we really, about shortly after, what year did he die in?

14:17.159 --> 14:17.920
Spring of 1970.

14:17.980 --> 14:25.429
See, I'd been department head three years, so he died before we got this really large national project underway.

14:26.130 --> 14:28.854
Jack Williams was president.

14:29.094 --> 14:30.015
He became aware.

14:30.476 --> 14:37.105
Were you, for Rudder, just a second, were you at all aware of any health problems Mr. Rudder was having?

14:38.106 --> 14:39.528
Please share any of that.

14:41.791 --> 14:42.732
I remember...

14:44.483 --> 15:03.005
going to a function, a faculty function of some kind, going home and saying to Frances, Mr. Rutter's having some problems.

15:03.986 --> 15:05.388
And she said, what do you mean?

15:05.528 --> 15:10.474
I said, one, he's gotten too heavy, and two,

15:11.990 --> 15:16.017
He was either drunk or under tranquilizers.

15:16.037 --> 15:21.406
And I want to think it's tranquilizers because his speech was a little bit slurred.

15:22.889 --> 15:26.275
And I think he's under medication from the strain.

15:26.295 --> 15:28.378
I think the job is killing him.

15:29.400 --> 15:35.230
And not long after that, we went to a function at Briarcrest, and he was there.

15:37.488 --> 15:43.439
and said some, I don't know what the function was, but he made some comments and the same thing.

15:43.519 --> 15:48.328
I said, Francis, Mr. Rudder's not right.

15:48.348 --> 15:57.004
I said, you know, the job's killing him.

15:57.024 --> 15:59.108
And I said, notice his speech.

16:00.252 --> 16:01.954
And he's too astute.

16:01.974 --> 16:03.756
He's not going to be coming here drunk.

16:03.776 --> 16:05.478
He's under some kind of medication.

16:05.578 --> 16:13.867
It's high blood pressure or tranquilizers or something, and he's too big.

16:13.887 --> 16:22.817
And wham, I came in from, I had been to Washington, and I came in, and they said he'd had a stroke or a heart, did he have a stroke or a heart attack?

16:24.586 --> 16:27.430
I think heart and then kidney failure.

16:27.710 --> 16:28.732
Okay.

16:28.752 --> 16:44.132
Well, he hadn't died when I came in, but I remember going to the administration building to talk to Harry, and he said, well, Mr. Rudder is in really bad shape, and he'd had a heart attack, I guess, and that they don't expect him to live, and he didn't.

16:44.213 --> 16:44.733
He didn't live.

16:44.773 --> 16:48.298
And I went home, and I said, Francis?

16:49.966 --> 16:51.529
Mr. Rudder gave his life.

16:52.590 --> 16:53.612
This job killed him.

16:54.614 --> 16:55.295
It killed him.

16:56.577 --> 16:58.600
And I believe that right now.

16:58.680 --> 17:00.363
It killed him, killed Jack Williams.

17:01.786 --> 17:06.133
When Mr. Rudder died, I believe General Ludeke was the interim.

17:06.273 --> 17:06.554
Yeah.

17:07.175 --> 17:12.543
Did that have any effect on you and scholars like you at the working level?

17:13.405 --> 17:15.889
Did Ludeke change anything, better or worse?

17:17.843 --> 17:23.071
I've had an opportunity for some reason to go visit with him.

17:23.091 --> 17:24.714
Oh, describe that.

17:24.734 --> 17:44.644
And it mainly, we had outgrown our space and Tom Payne had been working down in the Sour Lake area on the southern pine beetle and we had bought a mobile home and had it outfitted as a,

17:45.333 --> 17:49.919
lab, field lab.

17:49.939 --> 17:56.147
So Tom wanted to move that, he completed that work and he was, had no space.

17:56.467 --> 17:58.370
He needed a place from graduate students.

17:58.390 --> 18:03.657
So he came and he said, I want to move that moment home back to, I want to move it to the campus.

18:04.778 --> 18:11.927
And I said, well Tom, we'll have to get sewer hook up and that's fine, but I'll have to, let me check on it and see what we got to do.

18:12.448 --> 18:13.990
Well right away I found out

18:14.358 --> 18:18.043
that you had to have the president's approval to put a mobile home on this campus.

18:20.246 --> 18:25.894
So I, of course, had to talk to Harry and, or Jarvis, whoever.

18:26.875 --> 18:32.923
And I said, well, Tom's got to, we got to move that mobile home and I've got a good place to put it where it'd be out of sight.

18:33.730 --> 18:38.622
behind these Quonset buildings and you couldn't see it from anywhere in the road.

18:38.642 --> 18:39.945
And we got to have that space.

18:39.985 --> 18:42.191
Tom's got to have it."

18:42.211 --> 18:45.158
So they said, well, you have to go see General Ludicke.

18:47.298 --> 18:48.039
Okay.

18:49.521 --> 18:50.782
Is it okay if I make an appointment?

18:50.802 --> 18:53.145
Yeah, you just make an appointment and go up and talk to him.

18:53.165 --> 18:58.793
And so I called, and he had a very nice lady that was his secretary.

18:58.813 --> 19:01.236
He may eventually become his wife.

19:01.476 --> 19:02.958
After his wife died.

19:03.018 --> 19:04.260
Yeah, after his wife died.

19:04.840 --> 19:05.902
She was a nice person.

19:06.042 --> 19:16.495
I called her and said, I understand that I have to have General Ludicke's permission about moving a mobile home, which is a research trailer.

19:18.213 --> 19:21.736
So I'd like to get, talk to him about that, come see him.

19:22.938 --> 19:28.723
So I made an appointment.

19:28.743 --> 19:46.020
He called me on the phone, and he said, well, yes, I want to see where you want to put it, so why don't you come and pick me up, come to my office, and take me and show me where you want to put this and what you're going to do with it.

19:46.040 --> 19:46.701
So I did.

19:47.812 --> 19:51.736
Got him, brought him out here.

19:51.756 --> 19:55.441
That trailer may still be sitting over there.

19:55.461 --> 20:02.769
And I showed him what we wanted to do and why we needed to do it.

20:02.789 --> 20:08.315
And I said, you know, General Ludicke, we don't have enough space for our people.

20:08.475 --> 20:11.018
I've got people working these old Quonset buildings.

20:11.639 --> 20:14.562
They're working in that machine shed that's a tool shed.

20:15.200 --> 20:16.402
And these are laboratories.

20:16.663 --> 20:18.205
We got student, graduate students.

20:19.367 --> 20:24.957
And, you know, if we had the facilities, we wouldn't need this.

20:24.977 --> 20:27.141
But I don't have the facilities, so we got to make do.

20:29.124 --> 20:31.909
So he said, well, you can do it.

20:31.889 --> 20:37.901
Put it in that spot where you told me it's out of sight, and that's fine.

20:37.921 --> 20:44.615
And that day on, he called me Perry, and we had a real good relationship.

20:44.635 --> 20:52.311
When I became chancellor, he became a member of my Century Council, but I found him to be

20:52.291 --> 20:54.074
Pleasant.

20:54.094 --> 20:56.037
Surprised.

20:56.417 --> 21:01.606
What a little I ran into him, I found him to be very direct.

21:02.126 --> 21:03.128
Very businesslike.

21:03.408 --> 21:04.029
Businesslike.

21:04.490 --> 21:04.750
Do it.

21:04.911 --> 21:05.572
Get on with it.

21:09.358 --> 21:13.304
This is a sidelight that has nothing to do with the purpose of our conversation.

21:13.925 --> 21:20.475
I got to sit next to him on an A&M plane going to a coordinating board meeting in Corpus Christi.

21:21.097 --> 21:32.075
and got him to talking about what it was like to be an Air Force pilot or Army Air Corps pilot in the early 30s because he couldn't get a job as an engineer.

21:33.077 --> 21:34.900
Everything was broke, so he goes in the Air Corps.

21:35.701 --> 21:45.417
And for a brief time, they had to fly the air mail because the airlines went on strike, and he would be handed

21:45.802 --> 21:52.273
a big sack of mail, and they would tell you, okay, take this to Oklahoma City, and they handed you a highway map.

21:52.654 --> 21:58.704
And he said you'd fly low to see on the water tower what town it was.

21:59.285 --> 22:00.968
But that was delightful.

22:01.389 --> 22:04.574
All right, then he's replaced by Dr. Williams.

22:05.195 --> 22:08.080
When did you first have any interaction with him?

22:13.831 --> 22:14.773
I don't remember.

22:15.153 --> 22:16.596
What year did he come here?

22:16.616 --> 22:19.140
He comes in the fall, November 1, 70.

22:19.160 --> 22:20.102
70.

22:21.584 --> 22:23.267
Rudder dies that spring.

22:23.468 --> 22:30.280
General Ludeke then is interim president for president and chancellor because there was the jobs.

22:30.300 --> 22:31.782
Okay, so Williams came in 1970.

22:32.664 --> 22:33.225
Mm-hmm.

22:33.245 --> 22:34.206
Okay.

22:34.226 --> 22:34.607
Okay.

22:36.983 --> 22:37.764
November 1.

22:38.085 --> 22:38.185
Yeah.

22:39.487 --> 22:43.373
I can't remember her first meeting for Williams.

22:44.114 --> 23:01.219
As it turns out, my wife was playing golf at that time because her daughter was in school, in high school, and she became a friend of Margaret Williams and they played a lot of golf together.

23:01.239 --> 23:04.324
And the first time I really remember meeting

23:05.047 --> 23:30.852
him on a personal basis, although I knew who he was and I met him in, you know, official functions, but he invited us to their house one Sunday and he'd invited some other people and I think I was invited because I'd been invited to go to China on the

23:31.439 --> 23:38.389
I was on the second team that went into China in 1975, a group of ten entomologists.

23:39.331 --> 23:45.319
And they invited us over there because that was, the team was formed the previous year.

23:46.902 --> 23:55.835
So somewhere along there, Haskell was the first time I got to personally know him on a more personal basis.

23:55.855 --> 24:00.822
Describe him as you saw his personality and his manner.

24:02.692 --> 24:21.569
I thought Jack Williams was one, he's very outgoing, most articulate person, one of the most articulate people I ever met, his most articulate president, he and Frank Vandiver, we ever had here.

24:23.050 --> 24:32.158
And a person who understood academia and the politics around it and who appreciated

24:32.965 --> 24:34.708
Quality people.

24:34.728 --> 24:45.344
I think he had appreciation of quality people and had a keen sense of humor, although I have heard that he also had a bad temper, but I never did see that side.

24:45.364 --> 24:46.806
I never did either, but I'd heard that.

24:46.906 --> 24:52.535
I've heard that report, but I've not heard anybody yet give me some specific examples.

24:52.555 --> 24:52.775
Yeah, yeah.

24:52.795 --> 24:54.238
I don't know, but anyway.

24:54.618 --> 24:59.125
Had you ever been invited to the president's home before the Williams?

24:59.105 --> 25:01.009
I was never invited to the Rudders.

25:01.149 --> 25:02.371
Nor us.

25:04.315 --> 25:07.621
The first, when we were there, we were invited one of those evenings.

25:08.082 --> 25:11.248
When I walked in, I was going, ooh and ah, how beautiful.

25:11.749 --> 25:14.153
Mrs. Williams said, I don't know where you live.

25:14.173 --> 25:17.259
I don't know what it looks like, but I'll swap with you even right now.

25:17.720 --> 25:18.622
And I said, oh, why?

25:18.642 --> 25:20.505
And she said, because this is not ours.

25:20.485 --> 25:25.811
She said, anything I do, somebody second guesses.

25:26.412 --> 25:35.062
Describe what you think was the general feeling on the campus in the Rudder and Williams years about what was happening at A&M.

25:38.085 --> 25:49.378
Well, I don't think that Rudder was, he was not extremely

25:49.679 --> 26:00.071
popular among the faculty members who had come from other places.

26:00.091 --> 26:17.492
Now, and it may be I'm just drawing, I don't have a small sample, but the people that I knew, which mostly in the College of Agriculture who had gained PhDs at other universities, he was not real popular.

26:19.278 --> 26:24.323
And I think that was true among a number of faculty.

26:24.343 --> 26:28.186
He was not real popular, I don't think, in the liberal arts.

26:28.206 --> 26:40.998
And the criticisms were he doesn't have a PhD, can't make a decent speech, he's not articulate, and he's just not a good representative of faculty.

26:43.160 --> 26:47.884
And that was sort of the prevailing sentiment.

26:48.640 --> 26:52.285
Now, after he died, and he's too autocratic.

26:54.047 --> 26:55.649
We don't have any shared governance.

26:55.729 --> 26:58.132
We don't, you know, he doesn't listen to the faculty.

26:58.152 --> 26:59.233
He's just too autocratic.

26:59.894 --> 27:05.781
But see, after he died, he's everybody's hero because they see his accomplishments.

27:06.683 --> 27:15.053
And what I've discovered, I can tell you this, I've discovered that people at A&M, and it's probably true at other universities,

27:16.822 --> 27:21.069
They don't like, at the time, a benevolent dictator.

27:21.109 --> 27:29.121
They have lots of criticism of benevolent dictators, but after the benevolent dictators are gone, they appreciate them and wish they had them back.

27:30.463 --> 27:30.904
And why?

27:31.725 --> 27:37.313
Because a benevolent dictator, one will treat you all right, but they'll make a decision.

27:37.333 --> 27:41.400
They'll have to refer to all kinds of committees and procrastinate about it.

27:41.420 --> 27:45.546
And the biggest complaint I hear among people around here is

27:46.454 --> 27:47.035
about the years.

27:47.355 --> 27:48.917
You can't get a decision.

27:48.937 --> 27:53.423
Well, it's one thing you could get out of Rutter, you could get a decision.

27:54.744 --> 28:06.579
What did you think was the general opinion as Mr. Rutter was leading the changes of co-education, non-compulsory core, racial integration?

28:06.599 --> 28:12.667
Well, see, I was not an Aggie, so I'm not emotionally involved.

28:12.687 --> 28:14.149
What did the people around you think?

28:15.344 --> 28:19.974
I think in this department, for the most part, most of them thought that was a progressive move.

28:20.956 --> 28:33.302
I think although we had a lot of people who had been in the Corps who graduated from here thought that they could see the handwriting on the wall and that

28:33.282 --> 28:42.799
the university was not going to grow, it was losing enrollment, and could see that changes had to be made.

28:42.819 --> 28:46.205
I think our department of people recognized that right away.

28:46.225 --> 28:47.427
The other thing is that

28:48.200 --> 28:54.950
Mr. Rutter, of course, gets all this credit and Sterling Evans, but there is also another body working at the time called U.S.

28:54.990 --> 28:55.751
Supreme Court.

28:57.474 --> 29:03.182
And if these changes hadn't been made voluntarily, they would have been forced.

29:04.164 --> 29:14.339
And the handwriting was already on the wall that there were curriculums including entomology that's not offered in any other university in the state, that those are going to have to come open.

29:15.420 --> 29:17.363
So,

29:19.874 --> 29:23.440
I give Mr. Rudder and Sterling their due deference for all that.

29:23.480 --> 29:30.732
But at the same time, 1964 was the year they integrated the schools.

29:30.753 --> 29:35.561
The Supreme Court, I've got the name of that case, it was hanging out there on everybody's head.

29:35.581 --> 29:42.793
But I think everybody in our department thought those were

29:43.972 --> 29:50.683
Good changes and thought the core situation was stifling things.

29:50.703 --> 29:52.185
What about Dr. Williams?

29:52.225 --> 29:58.876
How did the, what was the general attitude you sensed about him among your colleagues?

29:58.896 --> 30:05.667
Well, people respected Jack Williams and the faculty and they liked him.

30:05.687 --> 30:11.616
I mean, he typified what you want in a university president.

30:12.473 --> 30:32.929
I remember one time saying to some people, Lloyd Benson came here and made a stop campaigning for Chet Edwards or somebody, I don't know who, but he, Pete Gehring, they made a stop at the airport.

30:34.090 --> 30:37.037
And some people were saying, well, that's the first time they'd seen him.

30:37.097 --> 30:41.687
They said, you know, what a courtly man.

30:41.787 --> 30:48.522
I said, if you were typecasting a senator, if you wanted to typecast a senator for a movie or something,

30:49.970 --> 30:52.313
You couldn't beat Lloyd Vinson.

30:52.894 --> 30:58.061
I mean, he was always a gentleman, always courtly, well-dressed, nice appearance.

30:58.902 --> 31:03.008
And the same about Jack Williams.

31:03.028 --> 31:05.151
You're going to typecast the university president.

31:05.211 --> 31:07.594
You couldn't beat Jack Williams.

31:07.875 --> 31:17.007
For you as a department head, did the routine of getting things done change under Williams from what it had been under Rudder?

31:18.877 --> 31:20.065
if you needed to get?

31:20.951 --> 31:24.415
Well, in the ag school,
