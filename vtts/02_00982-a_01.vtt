WEBVTT

00:02.562 --> 00:03.743
This is Frank Toback. Tonight I'm at the home of 
John Groff in San Antonio, Texas. The date is

00:07.808 --> 00:09.511
August 20th, 1984. I'd like to start off this 
interview with just a little bit of background

00:09.571 --> 00:18.482
information on you as far as where you were born and 
when. I was born in Ryan Park, Wyoming, which was a

00:20.564 --> 00:31.017
ranger station at the time.

00:34.338 --> 00:39.765
April

00:34.338 --> 00:39.765
4, 1941.

00:44.351 --> 00:59.991
When my father joined the Army Air Corps in the 
Second World War,

00:44.351 --> 00:59.991
my family moved to Montrose, Colorado after the 
war, and then the rest of the I—all my schooling was

01:00.511 --> 01:12.765
in Colorado, in Leadville, Durango, and I went to 
college at Western State College of Colorado. How

01:13.526 --> 01:15.728
old were you when you all moved to Montrose? I think 
I was eighteen months old. Oh, so you were just a

01:19.693 --> 01:20.954
baby then. Yes.

01:24.198 --> 01:30.265
What did your father's occupation in Colorado— He 
was a forest ranger, graduate of the University of

01:30.650 --> 01:42.524
Oregon

01:30.650 --> 01:42.524
with B.S. in forestry. What about your mother? 
What was she like? She was a school teacher. My

01:54.958 --> 01:58.682
parents got married, I believe, in Delta, 
Colorado. When she was teaching school, my father

01:59.202 --> 02:04.370
was foreshadowing today. Were you all religious 
at all? No, not very much. Well, where did you go to

02:11.301 --> 02:16.649
college again? Western State of Colorado, which 
is at Gunnison, Colorado. one of the cold spots in

02:26.945 --> 02:28.969
the country. What made you decide to join the Army? 
It was right during the Cuban Missile Crisis,

02:35.161 --> 02:49.408
which was in October of 1962 and I joined in 
November.

02:50.806 --> 03:04.943
Actually it came about that I wasn't—I had three 
years of college and I wasn't worried progressing

02:50.806 --> 03:04.943
very well and so I decided to lay out a year and I was 
going to take a trip around the world. And I was

03:06.906 --> 03:19.581
going to try to get down to Australia and work for a 
year there and then continue on.

03:20.101 --> 03:30.935
to work in Australia you have to be a citizen or 
apply for citizenship and I didn't want to give up

03:20.101 --> 03:30.935
my American citizenship so that sort of went by the 
wayside. At the time I was a smokejumper for the

03:32.337 --> 03:39.126
Forest Service up in the state of Washington. What 
were your duties as far as that? What was that,

03:44.794 --> 03:47.357
smokejumping? We fought forest fires and the way 
we fought forest fires was jumping out of

03:47.557 --> 03:57.911
airplanes and landing by parachute and fight 
forest fires. And it was a very good paying job and

03:58.372 --> 04:05.441
first year I was a smokejumper. I made enough money 
to buy a new car and put me through a year of school.

04:10.368 --> 04:12.030
That's cool. So it was a good summertime job. Yeah, 
sure. It was a lot of work, but. Yeah, it's a little

04:16.936 --> 04:18.037
worth it. I'd like to talk a little bit about your 
military training. When you first joined the

04:22.401 --> 04:25.944
Army, where were you located? Where did you first 
locate here at? My basic training was at Fort Ord,

04:29.047 --> 04:41.057
California, and then I went through advanced 
individual training there also in

04:29.047 --> 04:41.057
communications.

04:42.238 --> 04:46.622
How long was the boot camp last?

04:48.982 --> 04:53.370
I really don't remember, I guess it was about three 
months. What was it like? Just an ordinary boot

04:56.254 --> 04:58.759
camp? I had a friend from Montana. We used to get up 
before revelry and run four or five miles before

05:07.190 --> 05:09.513
Reveille. We got caught doing it. They wanted to 
know why—we weren't supposed to be out of the

05:11.855 --> 05:23.008
barracks at that time—so they wanted to know why 
and we told them we weren't getting enough

05:11.855 --> 05:23.008
exercise and basic training. It didn't make them 
very happy. When did you decide to join the Special

05:26.552 --> 05:29.375
Forces? Well, when I enlisted it was my idea to join 
the forces. a consideration—well,

05:36.468 --> 05:56.618
they couldn't guarantee me being in the forces, 
but they could guarantee me on my enlistment if I

05:36.468 --> 05:56.618
didn't make jump school, my enlistment was void 
then.

05:57.840 --> 06:05.732
And after I got through my individual training, I 
went to Fort Gordon, Georgia and went through jump

05:57.840 --> 06:05.732
school there. When I was at Fort Ord they put me 
through the barrier of tests for the special

06:06.185 --> 06:20.959
forces which I passed very highly.

06:24.543 --> 06:31.990
In fact, I had the highest test score that they ever 
saw.

06:33.151 --> 06:41.321
They called me in to find out why I made such a high 
test.

06:42.723 --> 06:44.685
The testing was sort of interesting. What they 
would do is they would give you about anywhere from

06:45.186 --> 07:01.285
fifteen to forty-five minutes of tape recording 
of a situation and then you had to answer questions

06:45.186 --> 07:01.285
in say like oral questions that they gave you and 
you had five choices here was excellent good fair

07:02.142 --> 07:30.242
bad or well was five choices like that and and they 
were asked a question with an answer and then you

07:02.142 --> 07:30.242
had to put down how you rated it and Total score, 
maximum score of the test was six hundred, and at

07:31.201 --> 07:45.236
that time you had to have three hundred to pass it, 
and I made over five hundred and fifty on the test.

07:45.296 --> 07:45.816
Fantastic. So I think it was the first time that 
anybody ever broke five hundred, so they really

07:46.677 --> 07:56.247
pumped me, and it was basically quick critical 
decision test. In other words, the questions came

08:01.353 --> 08:09.145
to you so fast you had to make a critical decision 
very fast, this is what they want. So spontaneous.

08:12.330 --> 08:12.551
Yeah. Why did you decide to become a medic?

08:20.062 --> 08:24.790
It seemed like it had the most interest to it. I 
always Well, when I grew up, the way I grew up was

08:27.530 --> 08:35.137
sort of old fashioned. You always helped your 
neighbor and you always, if somebody needed help,

08:36.077 --> 08:43.764
you always helped them out. So, I figured I could be 
the most help this way. Were there any medics, out

08:51.070 --> 08:56.355
of the medics, were there any of them 
conscientious objectors. Did you ever run across

09:00.800 --> 09:02.362
any? No. How were—in your military training, did 
they prepare you at all for the type of warfare that

09:04.744 --> 09:14.255
you would see in Vietnam? Very good. Very good.

09:19.241 --> 09:26.089
I had about two and a half years training before I 
went over there, and my medical training was at

09:26.491 --> 09:41.666
the degree where—they said we were equal to a 
doctor twenty years before—was how much training

09:26.491 --> 09:41.666
we had. We were able to do surgery, diagnose, 
prescribe medicine, which we did do very much.

09:51.036 --> 09:55.941
Now, in the war, When you went to Vietnam, when and 
what year did you go and where did you arrive in

09:56.326 --> 10:06.097
Vietnam at? I went over with Fifth Special Forces, 
which was the first permanently assigned unit in

10:08.479 --> 10:25.017
Vietnam, which our tour agility was one year. 
always before. Normally when somebody went over

10:26.858 --> 10:41.614
to Vietnam they went over on what they called a 
temporary duty station, which could be up to six

10:26.858 --> 10:41.614
months.

10:42.235 --> 10:54.328
And they moved the whole group, which was sort of 
unusual, was over to Vietnam and the fifth stayed

10:42.235 --> 10:54.328
there They started going over in 1964 and was 
completed probably in 1964 or 1965. The whole

11:06.642 --> 11:14.050
group was there and they stayed there until 
probably about 1978, I believe it was. When you

11:16.333 --> 11:24.062
were first going over to Vietnam, what did you see 
as America's role there in Vietnam? A way I saw the

11:24.768 --> 11:35.120
role of the Special Forces was mainly as a teacher. 
Officially, our assignment

11:35.160 --> 11:54.522
was to

11:35.160 --> 11:54.522
recruit local people,

11:35.160 --> 11:54.522
train them, arm them, and advise them on military 
and other matters in their area. And this not only

12:04.652 --> 12:09.819
took in Vietnam, but all of Southeast Asia.

12:12.443 --> 12:23.057
And we often went into, a lot of the teams went into 
what is called the mountain yard areas. and they

12:23.290 --> 12:27.395
had very good results with most of the mountain 
yards. What were the mountain yards? The mountain

12:32.422 --> 12:39.191
yards in Southeast Asia was equal to our American 
Indians.

12:46.300 --> 12:47.121
They lived in

12:52.889 --> 13:09.527
Vietnam for hundreds of years, and they were 
probably the only—the most native people, like

12:52.889 --> 13:09.527
our American Indians was in the Americas, to 
Southeast Asia. And they were fierce,

13:10.128 --> 13:21.580
independent, small tribes, and most of them never 
got conquered by the

13:23.635 --> 13:50.233
people who conquered that land for several 
thousands of years and they were mainly like our

13:23.635 --> 13:50.233
American Indians, hunters, wanted to keep their 
own religion and society isolated in mountain

13:23.635 --> 13:50.233
areas and they just didn't like to fool with them. 
What were your immediate thoughts when you first

13:51.260 --> 13:55.205
got in country? Well, we landed in Saigon. We flew 
over from North Carolina to Saigon and

14:00.152 --> 14:14.692
I couldn't believe the mass of people in Saigon or 
the smell. What was that like? If you've ever been

14:19.289 --> 14:23.633
in a smelly part of Mexico, you know.

14:28.418 --> 14:34.464
You know, open sewers and garbage out in the street 
and everything else. Not real pleasant. No.

14:41.591 --> 14:45.735
How long did you stay in Saigon?

14:47.217 --> 14:59.495
just a few days, and then we went up to the Special 
Forces, the 5th Headquarters, which was in Nha

14:47.217 --> 14:59.495
Trang, and there we got our assignment. We were 
previously assigned, and the area we were

15:00.316 --> 15:12.313
supposed to go into was

15:00.316 --> 15:12.313
at the corner of Vietnam, Cambodia, and And we were 
supposed to go in and recruit the mountain yard

15:13.272 --> 15:42.908
tribe by name of Jew, J-E-W,

15:13.272 --> 15:42.908
which were discounted by the other mountain yards 
as the savages, which you would compare to the, I

15:13.272 --> 15:42.908
guess, the Apaches of American Indians.

15:43.495 --> 16:00.977
After we got there we got another assignment as 
usual in the Army and instead of going in that area

15:43.495 --> 16:00.977
we went about three hundred miles south in the 
Mekong Delta.

16:01.398 --> 16:04.241
Did you ever have any dealings with our ARVN 
troops? Yes. What was your opinion of

16:05.843 --> 16:11.190
them? We had the highest camp in Fourth Corps, 
which was the Mekong Delta, and we had the first

16:13.583 --> 16:29.020
airborne ranger company of the Vietnese troops, 
and they were top notch. They were really good, and

16:29.941 --> 16:40.553
they were probably one of the oldest units in the 
Vietnam Army, and they were excellent fighters.

16:41.022 --> 16:45.527
What was the age of the average Arden soldier? The 
age of their varied greatly. In fact, as I was

16:49.111 --> 17:01.364
saying before our interview started that there 
was three of them that were veterans of the Battle

16:49.111 --> 17:01.364
of Bindinfu and on both sides. So they had 
experience? Yes, very much.

17:07.212 --> 17:10.035
They were very good fighters. They were good as any 
American's troops on the whole I would say. What

17:16.562 --> 17:22.068
was your feelings as far as the South Vietnamese 
people? Did you feel that they really wanted to win

17:22.108 --> 17:24.691
their war? Were they really dedicated to this 
cause? I feel like the South Vietnamese people on

17:29.777 --> 17:37.185
the whole They just wanted to have peace and be able 
to live and have a family, just like we do today.

17:48.515 --> 17:51.198
There's no difference. The area I was in was wild 
rice. In other words, when the Mekong River

17:57.267 --> 18:04.236
flooded during the monsoons, it covered the 
ground and they planted their rice. And then they

18:04.908 --> 18:10.213
harvested, and there was no dikes or anything like 
that. And of course, all the land was owned by

18:12.094 --> 18:21.443
absentee landlords, which probably never saw the 
land. And I would say the average income of the

18:22.564 --> 18:31.892
farmer there was probably ten, twelve dollars a 
year in American money. So they were extremely

18:33.073 --> 18:34.915
poor. But then you have to understand that this was 
in the tropics and about the only thing they would

18:35.317 --> 18:52.226
raise most of their fruits and vegetables or pick 
them wild and raise some chickens and hogs. This

18:52.546 --> 18:55.030
was self-sufficient. Yes, very much like our 
frontier farmer.

19:01.304 --> 19:23.262
How was your feelings towards the Viet Cong and the 
North Vietnamese Army in comparison to— I didn't

19:01.304 --> 19:23.262
have much contact with the North Vietnamese Army 
because they didn't really come down there in full

19:01.304 --> 19:23.262
strength, but the Viet Cong that were in our area 
were very poorly equipped and as far as weapons go

19:23.630 --> 19:37.065
and so on and they were—just

19:23.630 --> 19:37.065
the political arm was well organized. Their units 
were not very well organized and

19:38.406 --> 19:52.962
when we ran into it we generally always had a better 
hand. saying

19:53.414 --> 20:22.138
this too that don't forget that we recruited 
people from the local population and trained them

19:53.414 --> 20:22.138
under combat conditions and our troops weren't 
that good either but it seemed like that we were

19:53.414 --> 20:22.138
able to now in our camp we also had what was called We

20:23.587 --> 20:50.681
were

20:23.587 --> 20:50.681
supposed to advise them and they were supposed to 
advise the soldiers, but actually we were—it was

20:23.587 --> 20:50.681
the American money that paid for the soldiers that 
were in our camp and we did most of the planning and

20:23.587 --> 20:50.681
operations and so on. And they were more or less 
intermediaries and—but they—most of the Wukong

20:53.843 --> 21:05.515
Dai Bek were well-trained and well-disciplined 
soldiers. I'd like to switch gears and talk a

21:07.277 --> 21:12.041
little bit about your unit that you served with. 
What was your feelings toward your unit? Well, we

21:17.347 --> 21:21.471
were a maverick unit by the word go.

21:23.138 --> 21:28.023
The superior corps of our unit was extremely high. 
We

21:29.645 --> 21:40.137
have a chapter here of the Spatial Forces 
Association, the Alamo chapter. For example, how

21:41.198 --> 21:51.289
our unit operated, we have two Medal of Honor 
winners in our chapter. there's 88 members right

21:51.691 --> 21:53.593
now. So, it's—our unit expected—it was expected 
of us to have the—to do the best, and I would say

21:55.776 --> 22:19.842
probably 99 percent of the time that's what was 
given.

22:20.311 --> 22:25.517
being you were a medic, did it make any difference 
as far as your relations with the other guys? Or,

22:26.158 --> 22:33.386
you know, was there any problems as far as them 
cooperating with, you know, taking medicines and

22:26.158 --> 22:33.386
stuff like this? Did that get in the way of your 
friendship with them or the love for them or

22:33.566 --> 22:37.651
anything? No. Of course, I had the responsibility 
of the—approximately

22:39.112 --> 22:48.563
of the team There was two medics there, and I was a 
junior medic, but my senior medic did not like to

22:49.437 --> 23:01.211
work in medicine, so it was all turned over to me, 
which I was very happy with. And he was free to do

23:01.752 --> 23:06.218
other duties, and he was more interested in 
weapons. Now, someone who went over to Vietnam to

23:07.239 --> 23:15.529
be what is called free-qualified, you had to be 
qualified in three of the fields of the special

23:16.049 --> 23:38.677
forces, which was, I was, my main qualification 
was medic, and then they had communications,

23:16.049 --> 23:38.677
weapons, demolition engineering, and

23:16.049 --> 23:38.677
communications. And I was qualified in four, 
which was intelligence, demolition, and

23:45.884 --> 23:46.865
communications. Normally, when we went out on 
patrol, two of us would go out together. In other

23:56.316 --> 24:00.621
words, you covered each other's back. It didn't 
matter which field you were in, when it was your

24:00.901 --> 24:08.911
time to go out to patrol, you did. Of course, I 
probably went out more than anybody else because A

24:14.673 --> 24:26.467
lot of my work was also in what we commonly call 
pacifications, civil affairs, or propaganda.

24:27.188 --> 24:37.301
And I thought I was very good, and I used my medical 
one, not only to help the people, but also in these

24:27.188 --> 24:37.301
fields. And it ended up in an area, we went in and we 
built a new camp which was 95 percent VC area. And I

24:49.219 --> 25:01.330
was the only one that the people trusted, so I was 
the one that set up all the local intelligence

24:49.219 --> 25:01.330
there, because they would only talk to me. They 
wouldn't talk to any other Americans. Well,

25:03.532 --> 25:04.633
that's amazing. It was later in—I know you were 
there in As the war went on in later years, the Army

25:12.571 --> 25:29.473
came out with reports that there had been a few 
problems in the Army of mainly fragging, drug

25:12.571 --> 25:29.473
abuse, and self-inflicted wounds. Was there ever 
any problems with this that you saw? Maybe not in

25:33.358 --> 25:36.041
your unit, but maybe at all. No, none. One of the 
guys on our team claimed to have migraine

25:42.642 --> 25:51.212
headaches, and he wanted certain medication for 
it, which was very strong medication.

25:53.855 --> 25:58.840
I wouldn't give that unless he saw our doctor. See, 
we had a doctor for each company, which is very

25:58.880 --> 26:09.392
unusual, and a medical officer, a regular MD.

26:10.756 --> 26:17.165
I felt like if he had that bad of headaches, he 
should see somebody better than I was. And so I

26:18.086 --> 26:21.070
would not give him the medicine. So an interesting 
thing was that about every three months I had to

26:21.711 --> 26:26.498
give the team shots. And one of the shots was 
gamglobium, 10 cc's, which is a big shot. And you

26:35.510 --> 26:39.295
only can give 5 cc in each cheek of the butt. And to 
get around the argument of that, I called in, I

26:40.574 --> 26:52.588
would take the shots over to my CO and tell him it was 
time for shots and drop his drawers. And he would

26:54.270 --> 27:04.401
butt around and I would inform him that I was the one 
that was in charge of the medical thing and he

26:54.270 --> 27:04.401
better do it. And so he did. Then after he got the 
shots, I asked him to get the rest of the team

27:08.587 --> 27:13.452
together and it was no problem. In fact, they used 
to draw straws who gave me my shots. I imagine they

27:20.199 --> 27:22.961
all enjoyed that. Yes. But we had about four or five 
qualified medics in the team, so it was not

27:24.163 --> 27:38.577
only—our

27:24.163 --> 27:38.577
team count the young team, the average age was 
twenty-three, but in the team they already had

27:38.810 --> 27:50.487
fourteen missions in Vietnam.

27:51.789 --> 27:54.273
But it was an experienced team.

27:56.576 --> 28:01.323
What was your impressions of other units?

28:02.665 --> 28:08.614
When you say other units, that covers a whole 
gamut. Well,

28:09.218 --> 28:24.354
just other units maybe within the 5th Special 
Forces that you dealt with that you were in contact

28:09.218 --> 28:24.354
with. Well, the 5th Special Forces had several 
different specialized units. One of them was the

28:31.501 --> 28:37.487
Mike Force, which was—they were to go into areas 
like when a camp was being overrun and try to save it

28:37.872 --> 28:42.979
and things like this. Or if they got some good 
intelligence to lay a trap for a large body of a Viet

28:43.680 --> 28:51.230
Cong. These were extremely outstanding units. 
And then they had recon units that were also

28:56.497 --> 29:04.487
extremely good.

29:04.940 --> 29:14.872
what they went through for the physical and 
endurance and what they did was exceptional. A lot

29:15.933 --> 29:25.964
of people won't admit it, but I know there was—we 
even had teams that was in North Vietnam.

29:27.686 --> 29:32.432
So it seems like they had it run down by specialties 
very much. Yes, I would say like the Mike Force and

29:33.762 --> 29:45.196
these recon units and so on, that they were the 
elite of the special forces.

29:47.880 --> 29:53.146
I can't say how much—I don't think I could have made 
one of those units. I wasn't physically strong

29:53.226 --> 30:02.638
enough or my endurance wasn't enough to go into it. 
What was your impressions of the higher command

30:03.867 --> 30:10.435
and higher echelons?

30:10.976 --> 30:24.253
I think as time goes on I'll find out that this was a 
political war and conventional soldiers should

30:10.976 --> 30:24.253
have never went into Vietnam. My feeling is that, 
and the main idea The main feeling that I knew of the

30:31.019 --> 30:45.739
Special Forces, most of the people in there, felt 
like, first of all, they should leave it to units

30:31.019 --> 30:45.739
like the Special Forces to help the people there. 
But to do that, what we had to have was massive land

30:47.261 --> 31:00.840
reforms and to let the local people own their own 
land, and then they would be very willing to defend

30:47.261 --> 31:00.840
it And if this happened, I think it would have been a 
free country now. And instead of going in there

31:09.012 --> 31:21.786
with the massive—and then too, the other thing 
they did wrong was search and destroy, which was

31:09.012 --> 31:21.786
just extremely wasteful. They did not avoid 
taking hold in areas and You could never find

31:31.583 --> 31:37.992
everything that was an area when you went in there 
for search and destroy. I'd like to shift gears

31:40.135 --> 31:51.711
just a little bit now and have a little background 
on your unit and talk about your first encounter

31:40.135 --> 31:51.711
with the enemy. What was your thoughts and 
reactions when you first—your first

31:53.474 --> 32:01.405
confrontation with him? I don't even remember. It 
just happened. Yeah.

32:16.040 --> 32:21.667
With the training we had, it just happened. We were 
so well trained that you did things

32:23.770 --> 32:30.278
automatically.

32:32.907 --> 32:41.014
I would like to put into something about the medics 
of the Spatial Forces. Three classes I went

32:42.435 --> 32:52.183
through—the class before mine, my class, and the 
class behind me—I believe I'm the only survivor of

32:42.435 --> 32:52.183
the classes. And that's how great of casualties 
the medics had because when somebody got hit, they

32:53.324 --> 33:02.172
went and got them. And that was part of our 
training. Did it without hesitation or without

33:04.925 --> 33:07.988
thought? That's right. What were, as the war went 
on, what was the causes of most of the injuries?

33:20.942 --> 33:26.728
About seventy percent were from booby traps and 
mines and things like this. And the Viet Cong would

33:28.189 --> 33:31.753
put these indiscriminately over certain areas.

33:38.736 --> 34:02.449
We also used the advantage—I know one village was 
around the Cambodian border that we never were

33:38.736 --> 34:02.449
able to get into that we knew was a Viet Cong depot 
because they had a two-lane paved highway coming

33:38.736 --> 34:02.449
in from Cambodia and stopped right there at And 
this is where the Kaikai River went south toward

34:04.184 --> 34:18.122
Saigon and didn't take anybody with any great 
imagination why the road stopped there, right

34:04.184 --> 34:18.122
there at the river. And about a K and a half or about a 
mile inside the border, we built our camp right on

34:19.164 --> 34:29.938
the banks of the Kaikai River to stop the 
infiltration. And we were not liked very well by

34:30.509 --> 34:36.776
the Viet Cong for doing this. In

34:37.296 --> 34:55.757
a confrontation, how was it decided as far as what 
injuries were treated given top priority or was

34:37.296 --> 34:55.757
there any of this sort of thing?

34:57.679 --> 34:58.980
Probably the worst

35:01.610 --> 35:30.098
uh, action we had, I had, uh, 16 seriously or 
critically wounded and which I evacuated eight of

35:01.610 --> 35:30.098
them, uh, to, to the hospitals and, uh, all 16 I was, 
I was treating or, or I got, they, uh, they got to me

35:01.610 --> 35:30.098
alive or I got to them and none of them died until 
after I reached the hospital. And the priority was

35:38.094 --> 35:42.918
I was able to handle that Maine. And it was sort of an 
interesting thing. I have open-handed policy

35:50.404 --> 35:54.708
about medical treatment. I would treat anybody 
and no questions asked. And I know I treated a lot of

36:00.757 --> 36:09.866
Viet Cong when they thought they could not save 
their life, they brought them to me. And I know it.

36:12.909 --> 36:17.394
But I treated them and the majority of them did die. 
And they were just too far gone, there was nothing

36:19.296 --> 36:23.440
you could do. But this, to point out something 
else, the respect that the enemy had of me, I had a

36:30.288 --> 36:38.460
twenty-five thousand dollar bounty on my head. 
And at that time the airplane pilots only had ten

36:39.341 --> 36:59.890
thousand, so if you count how good a job you did by 
what your enemy thought of you, you can use that as a

36:39.341 --> 36:59.890
yardstick.

37:00.359 --> 37:02.903
What was the extent of the treatment in the field? 
Well,

37:05.327 --> 37:21.473
there was two diseases that I could not treat, and 
that was TB and leprosy.

37:24.001 --> 37:53.755
On the whole, I was told that I should not enter any 
of the three major cavities in surgery, and I did

37:24.001 --> 37:53.755
not, but at one time I thought possibly I would have 
to, because we had an American that came down with,

37:24.001 --> 37:53.755
excuse

37:24.001 --> 37:53.755
me, with either appendicitis or I diagnosed it as 
penicillus and we were socked in from the weather

37:54.983 --> 38:19.624
for four days and I treated him with antibiotics 
for the four days and finally was able to evacuate

37:54.983 --> 38:19.624
him out and when he got to the hospital he couldn't 
find anything wrong with him so I um cured

38:20.701 --> 38:24.927
appendicitis with the use of antibiotics. What 
were the major diseases that you encountered?

38:34.420 --> 38:38.806
Malaria was very prevalent. TB was also, and I 
would say probably eighty percent or more of the

38:39.187 --> 38:50.202
population had one or both. And the first week I was 
at our first camp, which was Don Phuc, I had four

38:50.772 --> 39:05.788
old—or five—I guess it was five old people die on me 
from pneumonia. And the trouble was that when they

39:07.430 --> 39:19.783
were brought to me, I could cure the pneumonia, but 
they were so far down with the disease that their

39:22.278 --> 39:38.292
body could not come back and they died because of 
basically no nourishment and what the disease did

39:22.278 --> 39:38.292
to their bodies. Was there any problems as far as 
the American soldiers had adjusting to the

39:39.633 --> 39:44.538
climate? Was there ever any heat stroke? Yes, 
there was.

39:51.404 --> 40:13.023
When you consider that during our wintertime, 
which was a dry season, it probably never got under

39:51.404 --> 40:13.023
90 degrees where we were, and

39:51.404 --> 40:13.023
you really had to push the salt tablets and water 
all the time. I know I was evacuated out of the area

40:14.645 --> 40:20.550
three times for a year. combat exhaustion or, you 
know, of a heat, and probably a combination of the

40:21.442 --> 40:29.092
two. Most of the time when I was at the camp, I'd put 
in anywhere from—an easy day would be sixteen or

40:29.832 --> 40:39.104
eighteen hours. And this went for seven days a 
week. And when you—the Americans normally pull

40:44.911 --> 40:50.318
guard on the Americans, but we pulled guard on the 
whole camp because inside our camp we figured at

40:50.500 --> 41:01.169
least fifteen percent of our troops were Viet 
Cong. And then we had daily operations and then

41:03.131 --> 41:12.819
normally night ambushes that you went out for all 
night and things like this. It really made some

41:13.760 --> 41:16.463
long days. Was there any venereal disease at all? I 
know a lot of armies in the past wars have had

41:22.023 --> 41:25.707
problems with this. No, most venereal diseases 
were in the larger seas. In Saigon. Mm-hmm. As far

41:36.681 --> 41:48.475
as having an intimate relationship with any of the 
local population, that was a very strict no-no,

41:36.681 --> 41:48.475
and none of our team did. Mm-hmm. Although at one 
time I did have four nurses working under me and one

41:50.137 --> 42:03.873
of the nurses would not hesitate to go out on two 
weeks patrol with me and carry a weapon and

41:50.137 --> 42:03.873
everything. I had some very good Vietnamese 
nurses I trained or the people before me trained

42:03.893 --> 42:15.086
and they were excellent. What sort of preventive 
measures were there for like malaria? We took some

42:21.018 --> 42:27.127
pills once a week that was supposed to prevent 
malaria. As far as I know, none of my team came down

42:27.628 --> 42:31.193
with malaria. But you could not prevent malaria in 
the local population. The only thing you could do

42:39.746 --> 42:42.430
is treat it when it came up. How did you treat it? 
With different kinds of medication. Okay. You had

42:50.431 --> 42:55.578
said that you had an open-door policy. What was the 
amount of patients that you treated, the

42:57.621 --> 43:05.351
doctor-to-patient ratio? Well,

43:06.693 --> 43:20.151
like I said before, I felt like our main object of 
going into Vietnam was to be teachers. Anytime I

43:20.502 --> 43:30.731
found somebody who was interested in medicine, I 
grabbed ahold of them and made a medic or a nurse out

43:20.502 --> 43:30.731
of them and taught them as much as I could. And I 
would say for approximately the eleven months I

43:31.671 --> 43:50.307
was there, sometimes

43:31.671 --> 43:50.307
with sending out different groups for sick call, 
in other words, a nurse would go out and have a sick

43:31.671 --> 43:50.307
call, maybe half a mile away from the village and so 
on, that sometimes I would have up to my medical

43:50.708 --> 44:06.928
teams and I would see up to 500 people a day for sick 
call. See, we were the only—I was the only modern

44:06.948 --> 44:11.414
medicine in the whole province. It was 
approximately 17,000 people in the province.

44:17.982 --> 44:18.903
That is unbelievable. And then I had— the twelve 
Americans and approximately six hundred

44:21.100 --> 44:28.629
Vietnese soldiers that were there. But used them, 
like I said before, used the medical field very

44:28.649 --> 44:40.883
much as a weapon against the Viet Cong. If you want 
me to expand on that? Yeah, if you would. At this one

44:47.131 --> 44:50.635
village up close to the Cambodian One day we went up 
there with our idea in hand and about three hundred

44:51.188 --> 45:07.832
yards from the village I set up a sick call station. 
And when the word got to the village I started

45:07.852 --> 45:12.579
seeing people from the village there. And it 
wasn't very—about half an hour later or so on that

45:13.420 --> 45:19.609
Viacom came down there in force with the idea to 
drive us out. And of course we retreated back

45:25.000 --> 45:35.932
towards the camp and we knew there was the field 
right next to the river there was full of mines. So

45:37.894 --> 45:39.836
we had to stay behind ambush. That's why it is that 
when I was there they got in position and we walked

45:40.336 --> 45:48.465
right through them and when the Viet Cong came they 
opened up on and drove him into the minefield and we

45:48.783 --> 45:56.970
could hear some mines going on and so we went back 
and
