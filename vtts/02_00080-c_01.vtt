WEBVTT

00:03.659 --> 00:12.010
So he said, okay, you run over there and drive over 
there as fast as you can and get back here and we will

00:03.659 --> 00:12.010
hold up and watch you do that. So that boy held up the 
processional until I could get back and we walked

00:12.330 --> 00:31.455
up on stage and I had just a notebook and I had an old 
speech and I took my pen out and I wrote down on one

00:12.330 --> 00:31.455
single piece of paper some points out of that and 
just kind of reviewed the old speech while all the

00:32.903 --> 00:40.134
welcomes and everything had been going on. 
Because I only had about 10 minutes until I had to be

00:41.497 --> 00:45.122
up there. And then I got up and gave the 
commencement, and I don't think that most of them

00:49.643 --> 00:58.237
ever knew that I wasn't supposed to have been the 
one to give it. It was a wonderful time. Did your

01:00.060 --> 01:02.043
colleagues give you any credit later? Oh, yeah. In 
fact, when I left the president's office, the

01:03.185 --> 01:11.078
president's staff gave me a big drawing that was 
made by a man here on campus that had the major

01:11.480 --> 01:21.432
things that happened during my career at those 
levels. And one of them was, here's a picture of

01:21.512 --> 01:27.559
Bill Mobley saying, you're the commencement 
speaker this morning. And it had a lot of things in

01:28.860 --> 01:31.263
it. It had like move into the Big 12. I helped get the 
new Texas Clipper for the campus at Galveston.

01:40.074 --> 01:41.335
They had that on it. It had the Sweet Sixteen 
basketball, which was the only time our girls

01:41.872 --> 01:52.866
basketball team had ever gone that far, and a lot of 
things like that. And it had gauges, rules for

01:52.966 --> 01:55.910
administration. They had all ten of them on there. 
And I was so proud that they put number one of

01:58.193 --> 02:08.807
integrity, because that was what I tried to 
instill through every component that answered to

01:58.193 --> 02:08.807
me. What else have we not? I don't know. Right.

02:17.302 --> 02:23.648
As you walked away from those years of leadership, 
for what were you most proud? And then were there

02:26.070 --> 02:31.856
any things that you wish you could have done, but 
you weren't able to? I would have to tell you that I

02:34.438 --> 02:38.642
was most proud for two things. One is that when I 
have gone back to be introduced, the introduction

02:40.158 --> 02:54.398
has been, here was a leader of character and 
integrity. The second was the

02:54.418 --> 03:08.157
advancements that we made in every academic 
program at the university and the leadership that

02:54.418 --> 03:08.157
we recruited to lead those programs.

03:17.106 --> 03:24.035
What

03:17.106 --> 03:24.035
would I like to have seen happen that I didn't get 
done?

03:28.120 --> 03:33.267
That's a tough question.

03:39.288 --> 03:53.409
Probably the final resolution to some of the

03:39.288 --> 03:53.409
difficult issues that I was bringing to closure at 
the time.

03:56.153 --> 04:03.244
That it would have been best had there been a longer 
period passed from the time I brought it to closure

03:56.153 --> 04:03.244
to the time a new person had taken it. Because they 
still had to live with a little of that around That

04:08.752 --> 04:10.516
really would have been it. And somebody sitting 
here might not tell you that, but in all honesty, I

04:10.536 --> 04:17.813
would want people to know that. I really would. In 
the search processes, as we now do it, with

04:19.377 --> 04:27.115
comparatively long and involved, lots of 
committees, In fact, are those searches as

04:29.137 --> 04:35.783
successful as they used to be when they were done 
more direct? I personally do not think so because I

04:37.044 --> 04:58.924
think too many times in search processes that in 
the academic area that too much is placed on what

04:37.044 --> 04:58.924
the resume, the curriculum VT, the academic 
credential might be with a real vacuum of looking,

04:59.478 --> 05:03.846
can that person lead people? And I tell you, I 
didn't use that philosophy when I would go talk to

05:03.866 --> 05:09.676
people about recruiting a dean or department 
head. I would tell them, I want to see written into

05:10.257 --> 05:18.452
this that this person is also a leader and can lead 
and has administrative abilities. Because I

05:19.033 --> 05:23.140
said, we could bring a National Academy of Science 
person in here that couldn't administrate their

05:23.423 --> 05:27.029
way out of a paper bag. I said, we want to do a 
background to know that they can lead. And I said, I

05:30.615 --> 05:32.377
want you to ask questions. I'm going to ask 
questions. I'm going to look at that. So don't

05:35.022 --> 05:37.406
bring me somebody only on paper. And I think that it 
gets so wound up today in just the academic

05:38.087 --> 05:49.465
credential side, the curriculum VT side, rather 
than what are their people skills, because

05:38.087 --> 05:49.465
leadership could be summed up in one word. 
Leadership is people. Period. The people skills.

05:58.192 --> 06:09.122
Earl Rudder wasn't much of a scholar, and Jack 
Williams wasn't a native Texan that hadn't been to

05:58.192 --> 06:09.122
A&M, but they both did a good job because they had 
some, and they both had integrity. That's right.

06:10.683 --> 06:15.167
Now, throughout all this, what role did your 
faith, your personal faith play? My personal

06:15.387 --> 06:19.030
faith played an enormous part in it. mainly 
because it kept me on the straight and narrow track

06:20.191 --> 06:31.182
that I would never do anything that would be 
questionable. I would never compromise the truth

06:31.802 --> 06:34.925
or integrity in any way. And I was very

06:35.866 --> 06:47.818
committed to the fact that my character would 
outlast and my name would outlast any other thing.

06:56.715 --> 07:00.500
You know, I'll be honest with you, every morning I 
would have a prayer. And my prayer was that I would

07:02.563 --> 07:12.397
have the sound wisdom that day to make the right 
judgment decision on the many decisions that I had

07:02.563 --> 07:12.397
to make. And secondly, that my own personal 
character and integrity would never be

07:15.777 --> 07:25.497
compromised or questioned by anyone around me. 
And you were a member of what congregation? I was a

07:27.881 --> 07:31.489
member of Central Baptist Church here at Bryan 
College Station. All those years? All those

07:32.270 --> 07:33.312
years. And still? That's right. And it was a 
growing congregation, but comparatively small

07:36.589 --> 07:42.178
in the 70s and 80s, wasn't it? Oh, yeah, compared to 
where it is now. It's 5,000 members now. It just

07:46.845 --> 07:50.490
bought 65 acres to look to relocate and expand 
again. Let's make believe that you are now hired to

07:51.331 --> 07:57.560
be a consultant to Texas A&M. What advice would you 
give Texas A&M and its leadership today? I would

08:04.681 --> 08:29.136
give them the advice to never compromise the 
traditions and value systems of the past and to

08:04.681 --> 08:29.136
recruit leadership that would be committed to 
what this university stands for. and to put in

08:31.512 --> 08:46.775
place a strategic plan

08:31.512 --> 08:46.775
that this leadership could buy into to move this 
university to top 10 status. I think a lot of that's

08:48.257 --> 08:57.191
already in place, but I would not want to see anyone 
come in and deviate away from those. We see so many

08:58.132 --> 08:59.494
other institutions, both academic, higher 
education, and other, that have begun to cave in to

09:01.145 --> 09:11.759
political correctness over what is right. And it 
takes a lot of courage today for administrators to

09:13.121 --> 09:28.502
stand up and to make the decisions that are based on 
what's right and what's wrong, what's honest,

09:13.121 --> 09:28.502
what's integrity. and not cave in to the political 
correctness crowd that's out there. To stay the

09:36.045 --> 09:37.107
course. I think they'll gain greater respect and 
achieve a whole lot more if they will do that.

09:50.649 --> 09:54.034
What did you learn here as an A&M student? that 
proved to be important to you later what did you

09:56.191 --> 10:21.270
learn about as an Aggie well I learned so much as an 
Aggie about I

09:56.191 --> 10:21.270
really believe the values and things in life that 
are important as well as a work ethic and I a respect

10:21.537 --> 10:41.421
for that which had been given to me in the way of a 
trust of my being a graduate of this institution to

10:21.537 --> 10:41.421
the point that I would never want to do anything 
that would reflect negatively on this

10:21.537 --> 10:41.421
university. To me, it was similar to growing up as a 
young man. I didn't want to do anything that my mom

10:47.348 --> 10:51.173
and dad would be ashamed of me doing. Well, I never 
wanted to do anything that my university would be

10:51.980 --> 10:58.409
ashamed of me doing.

11:00.332 --> 11:13.470
That was so reinforced through just the trust, I 
think, that had been put in us to be a student and the

11:00.332 --> 11:13.470
privilege of being a student here. Maybe it was 
because I had to work so hard to be able to work my way

11:19.925 --> 11:23.310
through this university. It was not something 
given to me. It was only given to me through great

11:26.734 --> 11:30.599
sacrifice of my parents and myself. So I learned a 
lot of that as a student here that carried on

11:31.420 --> 11:39.872
through really the rest of my life. I also learned 
what it meant to care for other people. You hear

11:47.330 --> 11:50.778
this, it's the Aggie family, it's the Aggie 
spirit. That's still true. And you learn to care

11:54.748 --> 12:00.943
for what happens to those around you. And when they 
have a need, you go to them. When you have a need,

12:02.848 --> 12:04.191
they come to you.

12:08.795 --> 12:10.297
Those are the main ones. All right. Typist, take 
this question and the response and put it back two

12:11.019 --> 12:20.313
or three questions. I should have asked this just 
before ask about the consultant. as you look back

12:25.062 --> 12:41.905
on all your A&M years, to whom, and if all the people 
involved in those years could be called together,

12:25.062 --> 12:41.905
to which ones would you express the greatest 
appreciation for what they've meant to you?

12:45.070 --> 12:46.231
To whom are you most grateful? I would be most 
grateful to Al Price, who was the dean of

12:46.552 --> 12:54.563
veterinary college early. and when I was a faculty 
member at A&M the first time as a student, and then

12:55.336 --> 13:09.671
later after I'd been to Auburn as a faculty member, 
to George Shelton for bringing me back here in

12:55.336 --> 13:09.671
1982, and clearly to Bill Mobley when he was 
president of the university. All of those had an

13:12.094 --> 13:22.385
influence and an impact in my own personal career, 
and I would give them a lot of gratitude, no

13:12.094 --> 13:22.385
question. And then,

13:26.605 --> 13:30.730
I would say the associate provost who served with 
me in the provost office.

13:34.154 --> 13:34.314
Who? Jeanette Ferris, Jerry Gaston,

13:34.414 --> 13:45.828
Bill Perry, Danny Parker, Sally Shepard. I won't 
leave anybody out because of all the teams of

13:48.171 --> 13:55.279
people that I had the privilege of working with, we 
probably had as effective and efficient team that

13:56.052 --> 14:05.963
got things done as any team of people I ever worked 
with in my life. And I told the deans when I took that

14:07.545 --> 14:14.693
position, I said, when you send something up 
there, you're gonna get an answer. I said, you're

14:15.814 --> 14:21.200
gonna get a yes, no, or I'm gonna tell you why I can't 
give you an answer right now, but it's not gonna get

14:15.814 --> 14:21.200
lost. And you're gonna get a response, you're 
gonna get a turnaround, and I'm gonna be decisive.

14:26.647 --> 14:30.171
And I'm going to make what I think is the best 
decision for the university. And you know, I

14:31.212 --> 14:34.055
didn't always please them because I had turned 
some of them down.

14:39.681 --> 14:41.944
So that would really be the team of people. During 
those years with lots of pressure, what did you do

14:41.964 --> 14:45.768
to relax? Well, early when I still had time, I 
jogged and got some exercise. Later on, when I was,

14:54.878 --> 15:03.030
the last two or three years of being provost and the 
presidency, there were not many times too

14:54.878 --> 15:03.030
relaxed. About the only thing I could do would be go 
home at night and just crash in the chair and maybe

15:03.050 --> 15:10.040
watch television or something. But if I were to do 
it over again, I personally would try to allocate

15:10.120 --> 15:19.013
some time for particularly exercise. I said, I 
don't have time to exercise. Well, you don't. You

15:23.828 --> 15:24.789
have to make time. And you just have to do those 
things.

15:31.215 --> 15:49.033
Let's make believe that someone walks up to you 
with a check for a million dollars and places only

15:31.215 --> 15:49.033
one restriction on that, and that restriction is 
you must pass it to Texas A&M, but you decide what

15:31.215 --> 15:49.033
use will be made of that money. If you had the 
opportunity to make a big gift, A&M, what would you

15:51.275 --> 15:55.940
want it to be for? If I had the opportunity to give a 
million dollar gift, designate where it went, it

15:57.622 --> 16:07.133
would go to student scholarships. And the reason I 
say that is that I probably could not have got

16:08.695 --> 16:18.126
started in college had it not been for some 
academic scholarships that were given to me the

16:18.815 --> 16:21.819
first year. And secondly, A&M has protected still 
selecting a lot of students that are maybe not from

16:23.422 --> 16:39.304
the wealthy families and they're not in the 
highest rank of their class or something. They're

16:39.324 --> 16:43.971
still taking just the students that have to work 
for a lot of what they get. And over the years, I've

16:44.912 --> 16:47.556
watched those students And I've had so many of them 
come back to me, students who I encouraged to get

16:48.262 --> 16:53.708
in. And I've watched them over the years and their 
achievements. And that's been such a great reward

16:59.455 --> 17:03.559
for me to see them. Under your program, would they 
be restricted by major or geography? No,

17:08.205 --> 17:08.925
absolutely not. How do you identify which ones are 
most deserving? I probably would just simply give

17:12.249 --> 17:14.792
it to the university and ask that it be given to 
students based on financial need

17:15.464 --> 17:25.837
to help them to be able to go. I tell you one other 
reason, too, in that I saw students, particularly

17:27.198 --> 17:35.869
in the College of Veterinary Medicine, graduate 
with such an overwhelming debt. And my wife and I,

17:36.338 --> 17:47.490
right now through our church, adopt about six to 
ten students a year that we just kind of become

17:36.338 --> 17:47.490
second parents to while they're here. And there's 
a little girl that's the sweetest little girl. Her

17:50.814 --> 17:54.358
mother and dad probably could have never given her 
a penny. She worked her way through A&M. She's now

17:56.560 --> 18:02.146
got a terrific job, but she left here with probably 
about $30,000 or $40,000 in debt. And if it could

18:03.628 --> 18:05.350
help a girl like that, She's the first one from 
either side of her family. In fact, I felt so sorry

18:09.054 --> 18:15.364
for her because her dad did not even come to her 
graduation. That broke my heart. In fact, I'd like

18:18.688 --> 18:22.514
to have kicked him. How sad. How sad. Like one of the 
things that doesn't have anything to do with this

18:25.338 --> 18:29.765
interview except another good point. Dr. 
Williams. at the end of commencements would have

18:31.334 --> 18:38.586
the honor students stand, the 3-5, the 3-7-5, dah, 
dah, dah. Then he would say, now I want those

18:39.608 --> 18:47.121
students to stand who are the first in their family 
to finish college. Oh, I wish I'd have thought to

18:47.742 --> 18:49.325
have done that. And there would be some mothers 
reaching. Oh, man. Then he'd say, but now I want the

18:55.853 --> 18:59.837
most worthy people in this room to stand. The 
parents of us. I want the parents of these to stand.

19:04.202 --> 19:05.864
I wish I had known that. I would have done that. 
Well, I stole that idea and used it over and over and

19:06.744 --> 19:09.748
over. I would love to have done that. Because most 
people don't think that there are still those

19:11.029 --> 19:17.075
situations as often as there are. Oh, there still 
are. That's right. Yes. Let's see. Two other

19:20.159 --> 19:22.401
questions.

19:25.435 --> 19:27.177
What does it mean to be an Aggie?

19:33.784 --> 19:36.047
What does it mean to be an Aggie? I bet that 
question's been asked and answered millions of

19:36.067 --> 19:39.111
times. To me, it means

19:41.173 --> 19:54.548
to be a graduate and former student

19:41.173 --> 19:54.548
of Texas A&M University.

19:57.464 --> 20:10.944
who has been given something in life that will last 
a lifetime.

20:10.964 --> 20:25.125
And that something is in part

20:10.964 --> 20:25.125
the family, the value, the traditions that yield a 
purpose

20:26.489 --> 20:35.078
in life.

20:35.098 --> 20:37.400
I don't know, I could add a lot more. Last question. 
What are your feelings, what are the feelings that

20:39.122 --> 20:44.207
are in your heart today about A&M? Well, I could 
never be more proud of A&M than I am of A&M today.

20:50.913 --> 20:54.657
And, you know, where it stands nationally, 
internationally as a university. I travel the

20:57.607 --> 21:10.787
country a lot right now, all over the U.S. And when 
people find out that I was a former president of

20:57.607 --> 21:10.787
A&M, they have great respect. And I could not be 
more proud of my university than I am of where it is

21:12.009 --> 21:19.059
today and where I think it's going in the future.

21:21.783 --> 21:24.407
I must admit that there are a few things probably 
that have been done in the past several years for

21:25.248 --> 21:31.595
political correctness that I would prefer to not 
see done. I regret that the anti-discrimination

21:33.456 --> 21:40.324
policy was changed. I regret that I have heard that 
they have cut out prayer at football games. I do not

21:46.750 --> 21:49.633
know that, but I heard that recently. I hope that 
hasn't happened, and I hope it never happens.

21:55.741 --> 22:02.449
I would never want to see the basic foundations

21:55.741 --> 22:02.449
changed. I think Dr. Bowen has done a superb job. I 
stand fully with him in Bonfire, and I honestly

22:08.556 --> 22:22.272
believe I would have taken the exact same actions, 
and I just hope and pray that no renegade Bonfire

22:22.893 --> 22:33.784
takes place because that is not action that is 
consistent with the Aggie spirit and honor code or

22:22.893 --> 22:33.784
code of honor. That's a great thing.
