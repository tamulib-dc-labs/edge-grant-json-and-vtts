WEBVTT

00:02.545 --> 00:09.912
It's to be sort of the heartbeat of our discipline 
in terms of terminology, the theory base, where

00:02.545 --> 00:09.912
we've been. It's changed some with new 
postmodernism and those kinds of issues, but it's

00:09.972 --> 00:15.157
still basically the course. I started teaching 
that, and I taught program evaluation, which is

00:15.217 --> 00:24.126
now turned into the AEIS accountability system 
for the state of Texas. We go online for that. And I

00:25.647 --> 00:27.168
brought the futures class here. We had a planning 
course, but not a futures class, so I initiated the

00:31.267 --> 00:35.533
first futurism class on this campus in 1975. In 
other words, the future of public, of education.

00:39.379 --> 00:47.190
Well, it's called Planning Futurism, and it's in 
the College of Education, but I'm offering it this

00:39.379 --> 00:47.190
semester, and there's 20 students. We just closed 
it. And they're from business, engineering,

00:48.512 --> 00:52.037
agriculture. So it's an interdisciplinary 
class. And Letha Malloy was in one of my early

00:55.282 --> 00:58.607
classes, John Calhoun, we had on the committee, 
and we did one of the first futures dissertation,

00:58.840 --> 01:13.383
the first future dissertation on this campus, 
where we interviewed the great higher education

00:58.840 --> 01:13.383
stars who came in here for national conferences. 
And she did a study on Delphi, where the

01:13.904 --> 01:18.031
universities were going in the next 25 years. And 
she wound up, as you know, being a vice president at

01:18.592 --> 01:22.658
Southwest Texas State University. But John 
Calhoun was on that committee. And I'll never

01:25.773 --> 01:33.202
forget, the graduate dean at the time saw that 
proposal and said, what is this futurism stuff?

01:33.222 --> 01:34.743
What are these scenarios? And what are these 
cross-impact matrices things? And we broke the

01:37.647 --> 01:40.310
new paradigm. We created a new paradigm for new 
kinds of studies because the graduate dean at the

01:40.330 --> 01:46.116
time wasn't sure. And of course, having Calhoun on 
the committee didn't hurt.

01:51.912 --> 01:53.574
So these were all graduate courses. All graduate 
courses. A normal teaching assignment then was

01:54.615 --> 01:56.797
how many? It was two courses a semester. And you 
wind up in a hurry with a great number of doctoral

01:59.500 --> 02:05.967
students who have an interest that you have. And at 
that time, the program wasn't as large as it is now,

02:06.128 --> 02:11.734
but it was quite healthy. And I've always, since 
I've been here within the first two years, have

02:11.814 --> 02:21.244
either had somewhere between 15 and 30 students 
I'm chairing on doctoral committees. Did, back to

02:21.815 --> 02:28.683
advice, did anybody give you any do's and don'ts 
advice?

02:31.686 --> 02:32.667
You know, not really. Not really. It was just do 
your thing. And Dr. Hensling, I guess, was the only

02:36.451 --> 02:45.702
one that may have said when I would ask him things. 
But I can't remember anybody saying, this is what

02:45.742 --> 02:51.248
you do, this is what you don't do. They assumed you 
knew that since I'd been a department head and been

02:51.650 --> 02:55.636
teaching at other universities. But no, I'd say 
that was a problem. Were there any differences

02:59.182 --> 03:07.715
that you quickly noticed between TCU, Miami, 
Tulsa, and A&M? I think the inflexibility that I

03:08.115 --> 03:11.200
found here. There we had department chairs. There 
was some rotation took place. There was more

03:16.912 --> 03:30.250
liberal thinking about interdisciplinary kinds 
of issues, even though at one time we'd had an

03:16.912 --> 03:30.250
interdisciplinary education doctorate, but now 
since it had become a department, it was pretty

03:16.912 --> 03:30.250
much a turf kind of thing. It was more isolated than 
I'd seen at Miami University. I'd been on the

03:34.376 --> 03:39.443
faculty senates at Miami, and I was on the first 
faculty senate at Texas A&M. Two of us were elected

03:41.506 --> 03:45.872
from the College of Education in 1983. And I was 
fortunate enough to be one of the first elected.

03:49.640 --> 03:55.710
That was exciting, with John McDermott and all the 
group trying to say, what's the core knowledge

03:49.640 --> 03:55.710
going to be in our university? How are we going to 
deal with such things as accrediting problems

03:56.531 --> 04:05.986
when you're forcing students to take too much 
liberal arts and humanities? How are we going to

04:06.988 --> 04:12.737
become more decentralized and have more power by 
faculty? rigid department structures that this

04:13.021 --> 04:17.226
university has become accustomed to. We were able 
to shatter and break a lot of that, and we were

04:17.266 --> 04:25.395
really concerned about the kind of hold that the 
department has had on the faculty. And that was a

04:26.056 --> 04:30.060
meaningful three years to be on that first faculty 
senate. Who were the key leaders that helped

04:30.081 --> 04:33.685
produce that faculty senate? John McDermott got a 
group of people together over his department, and

04:33.945 --> 04:42.775
he was very instrumental in getting the group 
together. Paul Parish was involved in that. I was

04:47.205 --> 04:48.047
involved in it. David Erlandson here was involved 
in it. I'm trying to think of some of the others. Old

04:54.899 --> 04:59.466
Bill Barzak was very much involved and helpful. 
I'm trying to think of a lady who's now deceased

04:59.967 --> 05:08.442
that was in biochemistry.

05:10.143 --> 05:11.524
She was very active in it. She was one of the first 
really active women in the political side of the

05:11.825 --> 05:16.149
university. But see. Were there any obstacles you 
all had to overcome? No, because we had, you know,

05:21.834 --> 05:31.624
the only obstacle we had, I guess, was just 
tradition, because Rutter would not consider

05:21.834 --> 05:31.624
having a faculty senate. Williams would have, but 
it was just before its time. Well, here comes our

05:34.587 --> 05:37.990
president from Rice University, who was very 
open, very faculty-oriented, and

05:38.628 --> 05:49.847
Frank was very interested in the future, 
visioning, and didn't like committee meetings

05:38.628 --> 05:49.847
too much. Now, this is true. He didn't like 
committee meetings too much, but he was a great

05:51.510 --> 05:55.256
faculty president. He really was 
faculty-oriented, and I told him that every time I

05:56.138 --> 06:00.525
saw him. And he helped us make this faculty senate 
work. So I'll always admire that man a great deal.

06:06.444 --> 06:09.728
And who was the chief academic officer at that 
time? McDonald, let's see. Donald McDonald?

06:13.413 --> 06:17.199
Yeah, Donald McDonald was one of the chief 
academics. Because Prescott had already.

06:18.461 --> 06:28.475
Prescott, see, is the one I was trying to mention a 
while ago, who came here as provost in 76 or 77 and

06:18.461 --> 06:28.475
said, I'll not promote any Aggies. Yes, Prescott 
takes over and says that. That's right, that's

06:31.559 --> 06:32.260
right. Do

06:33.050 --> 06:39.760
you remember who the first faculty senate 
chairman was? Yeah, it was John McDermott. John

06:40.701 --> 06:41.242
McDermott. Yeah, speaker, yeah. And Bill Jenkins 
and I were sergeant at arms. Bill later became, you

06:47.572 --> 06:51.297
know, is now provost or president at LSU. And, oh, 
yeah, he was a big, healthy guy, and I wasn't any

06:52.479 --> 06:56.244
tiny guy. And so he'd stand up in his South African 
accent and mine my Texas accent, and we'd say, all

06:56.845 --> 07:01.993
right, settle down, guys. What did the deans think 
about the coming of the Senate? They weren't

07:07.831 --> 07:17.581
overwhelmed by it, but yet it was exciting because 
they then saw, maybe with my exception, they then

07:07.831 --> 07:17.581
saw who the leaders were on campus. Because the 
faculty, the first elections, I think clearly the

07:18.342 --> 07:31.255
faculty really became involved in it and elected 
the people they thought could best represent them

07:18.342 --> 07:31.255
in situations where they opposed the 
administrative structure. And so we had some

07:31.522 --> 07:36.228
pretty vocal people and some that weren't afraid 
to speak out. And it was an exciting time, exciting

07:36.909 --> 07:39.812
time. All right, let's jump back to your career. 
How long did it take to get some doctoral students

07:44.298 --> 07:49.004
for you? First semester, I probably picked up 
three or four, some of McNamara's people. Letha

07:55.331 --> 07:56.413
Malloy was one. He'd kind of started with her. I 
picked up some of his students, three or four right

07:58.893 --> 08:09.891
quick, and then I'd say within two years I had ten, 
and then within five years it hadn't changed much

07:58.893 --> 08:09.891
between eighteen and thirty, you know. Normally 
how did, in those early years particularly,

08:10.552 --> 08:17.924
normally how did you and a graduate student become 
related? Well, through my classes many times, I'd

08:18.245 --> 08:24.715
get to know students through classes, or contacts 
I was beginning to make in the field, or through

08:25.133 --> 08:32.022
some literature or something I had written. 
Someone would get in touch with me, want to study

08:32.463 --> 08:35.507
with me, those kinds of things. And I have had 
students over the years that have come to study,

08:35.607 --> 08:50.668
come to university to study with me, and that's 
always been nice to have because immediately when

08:35.607 --> 08:50.668
I got here, Harold Hawkins said, I want you to be my 
backup for the administrative leadership

08:50.885 --> 09:16.993
institute which used to be the old june conference 
that's been going on here since the turn of the

08:50.885 --> 09:16.993
century for county superintendents we used to 
have a summer conference here well in 83 84 dr

08:50.885 --> 09:16.993
hawkins and i with the advisory committee changed 
that to meet at the hilton in the fall and it's in

08:50.885 --> 09:16.993
november third week in november and i've been 
running that by myself since 19 oh 86 i guess and uh

09:17.412 --> 09:18.874
So that was something I picked up. It's a year-long 
planning thing, but therefore it's helped me

09:18.954 --> 09:27.967
become very visible with the Texas Association of 
School Administrators and build the links. And we

09:27.987 --> 09:30.871
have a new dean come in here, you know, like Dr. Jane 
Conley. First weekend she was here, I took her to

09:31.392 --> 09:41.926
the Texas Association of Texas School Board State 
meeting, and I enjoyed introducing her to all the

09:31.392 --> 09:41.926
power players, you know, in K-12 education. And 
because our primary responsibility here,

09:42.667 --> 09:46.693
whether people agree with me or not, is preparing 
future leaders for Texas and American schools. We

09:50.621 --> 09:56.327
prepare counselors, we do clinical psychology, 
we do a lot of other things, but that's still our

09:50.621 --> 09:56.327
primary thrust. We'll live and die with that. And 
so, and I have her involved in ALI each year, and so

09:59.010 --> 10:14.908
she's now, with her great skills, she's now very 
much involved with the power players and

09:59.010 --> 10:14.908
commissioners, and pretty soon in November I'll 
have the commissioner here, and uh... key players

10:15.310 --> 10:44.119
on issues like teachers supply and demand and 
total systemic school change and uh... it's been

10:15.310 --> 10:44.119
fun to be out on the front of that and i've got a 
thirty person advisory board that helped me do

10:15.310 --> 10:44.119
that now normally did a doctoral student contact 
you personally about your being a chairman yeah

10:15.310 --> 10:44.119
they'd contact me and say your interests are very 
similar to mine i'd like for you to be my chair you

10:15.310 --> 10:44.119
understand my problem being a superintendent 
principal and i think that uh... where some of the

10:44.690 --> 10:52.843
other professors hadn't had any experience in 
public schools much, I had, and they'd come to me

10:44.690 --> 10:52.843
because I had both a scholarship and a practice. 
And most of them were already in the real world.

10:55.608 --> 10:57.210
Yeah, most of them were in the real world. 
Occasionally I'd have a young one like a David

10:57.631 --> 11:07.788
Thompson or others who were tremendous scholars 
who wanted to do research with me, and they had not

10:57.631 --> 11:07.788
had much administrative experience, but they 
wound up in higher ed. Those types wind up in higher

11:07.828 --> 11:09.570
ed. I've got one right now, Clark Ely, who's just 
been appointed Director of Planning, Research,

11:11.656 --> 11:15.641
and Evaluation for the College Station Schools. 
He'd been an assistant principal, but he got

11:16.181 --> 11:26.633
involved with me and my research for about a year, 
and he decided he wanted to be in higher ed rather

11:16.181 --> 11:26.633
than public schools, so he's going to do that for a 
while and then head toward university. Now, were

11:27.214 --> 11:30.478
most of them then part-time students? Yeah, most 
of them were part-time students. I usually have

11:32.860 --> 11:39.688
one or two around here that are full-time that we 
can get enough scholarship money for or

11:32.860 --> 11:39.688
assistantship money for. And how many of them 
would have a dissertation topic that would end up

11:40.073 --> 11:48.361
being appropriate for them to do? And how many 
would need your advice? Well, 90% of them need my

11:50.162 --> 11:52.985
advice. Now, I've got a young woman here on campus 
who's working with an agency. She came in here this

11:57.569 --> 11:58.710
morning. And I've been talking with her for about a 
year on research she's doing on campus for her job,

11:59.551 --> 12:06.657
related to her job. And I said, hey, let's extend 
that into your dissertation. So sometimes

12:09.908 --> 12:17.695
they'll come in to me with an idea, but most of the 
time, through our conversations, I'll help them

12:09.908 --> 12:17.695
come up with an idea for a dissertation. Who were 
some of the first students of which you're most

12:17.715 --> 12:23.299
proud to claim? Well, I guess looking back on it, 
Letha Malloy certainly was one that went toward

12:24.721 --> 12:39.173
the direction of higher education. If I start 
digging a little bit more, John Wilson, who's

12:39.710 --> 12:48.358
superintendent of school down at Clear Creek, 
just been honored by NASA. Just an outstanding

12:49.740 --> 12:52.062
school leader. I think probably Cheryl Shake 
Shaft was one of my students who wound up at Hofstra

12:53.764 --> 13:01.752
as one of the leading spokeswomen for women in 
administration. I can go on and on with that. David

13:06.416 --> 13:09.379
Thompson's over at UT San Antonio. outstanding 
scholar. Superintendent-wise, Harold Rahm,

13:13.663 --> 13:17.567
superintendent of school at Belton, was one of 
mine. Jim Boyle, superintendent of school at

13:18.128 --> 13:21.932
Temple, is one of my students. Kenny Johnson, 
superintendent over at Bremond. And I just don't

13:25.516 --> 13:35.367
know how many principals I have out there, but 
those are some of the people who've really

13:25.516 --> 13:35.367
distinguished themselves both in scholarship 
and How long would it take, since they would be

13:35.431 --> 13:46.288
full-time employees, in the 70s, 80s, 90s, how 
long did it take an average doctoral student to do

13:35.431 --> 13:46.288
their degree? Three years. Oh, that's all? Three 
years, because if they could come in here and spend

13:49.413 --> 13:58.847
one year with me, they could get a lot of their 
coursework done. And then their research would

13:58.867 --> 14:01.371
take them about a year and a half to two years. If 
they're EDD, which we started, as you know,

14:01.655 --> 14:19.794
college started EDD in about 1976 or 7, for people 
who could not come in regular residency but could

14:01.655 --> 14:19.794
do it in the summer times, those people usually are 
sometime around between three and four years

14:01.655 --> 14:19.794
because they can come in the summers and take a lot 
of work. And then they come and take weekend

14:20.295 --> 14:22.056
courses. And now with TTVN, like I'll be teaching 
in the fall, if they get a dissertation topic early

14:22.136 --> 14:30.345
on, they have a record of study rather than 
dissertation. The scholarship is just as

14:30.747 --> 14:37.713
rigorous, but it's more of an action research as 
opposed to a theoretical piece. Now, I'm assuming

14:39.135 --> 14:45.500
that these students were not typical Aggie 
students. They're really not. If you get a former

14:46.962 --> 14:56.030
student to come in here, you don't have to really 
worry about them understanding all the

14:46.962 --> 14:56.030
traditions of A&M and those kinds of things. But I 
spent a lot of my time in class say, hey, you're an

14:58.473 --> 14:59.675
Aggie now. I don't care if you don't have your 
undergraduate here. And I still remember your

15:02.038 --> 15:07.467
line from a commencement address you made when you 
said being part of the Long Maroon line. And I've

15:08.168 --> 15:09.850
quoted that 1,000 times. I say, you're part of the 
Long Maroon line by sitting in my chair in my

15:09.911 --> 15:13.796
classroom. And I'm going to do all I can to help you 
understand the traditions of this university. I

15:17.943 --> 15:19.806
want you to feel close to it like I do. And if you just 
come here as a student and not really become part of

15:19.846 --> 15:27.197
the culture, you'll never really experience and 
really know A&M like you need to know it. Man's

15:27.397 --> 15:29.179
Silver Taps, I talk about that. Muster, I have them 
go to Muster. And I have them try to, I've written

15:31.421 --> 15:38.308
three books, you know, Good Bull, 30 Years of Aggie 
Escapades that a bunch of them have read about some

15:31.421 --> 15:38.308
of the antics. And so I enjoy doing that. And I like 
to say, look, you're not mediocre anymore. You're

15:43.754 --> 15:45.716
coming to Texas A&M to be a leader. And sometimes 
maybe the GRE scores are not as high as they might be

15:46.937 --> 15:53.344
at some other university, but you're here to learn 
how to lead. We want you to be a leader in this

15:54.205 --> 15:57.268
nation, not just a follower. And if you're going to 
be in my class, I don't want you going out there

15:57.687 --> 16:00.451
being a follower. And they believe me because I 
mean it. What about sharing some Goodwill-type

16:04.556 --> 16:12.206
experiences that relate to graduate students in 
education? All right. There's one that I think is

16:13.608 --> 16:15.811
just priceless. We had a student here who was 
beautiful in English, a graduate student from

16:16.272 --> 16:22.540
Lamar University, very naive guy, very bright. 
There were three of us ran around together. We had

16:26.611 --> 16:33.159
Dr. Lee Martin on our committee, for instance, Dr. 
Hubert, several others, Dr. Barton Nelson. And

16:34.020 --> 16:38.645
here was this really bright guy from Lamar that 
would believe anything. You know, we'd short

16:39.186 --> 16:41.008
sheet him and stuff like that. We'd go on research 
trips, and we'd do it three times. He never caught

16:43.371 --> 16:44.052
on. So Norval Northcutt, who wound up, he's 
teaching UT now, statistics, mathematics, and so

16:45.634 --> 16:52.582
on. We caught him early in his programs, And we 
said, you've got to have complex variables,

16:55.028 --> 17:01.035
mathematics 662, in order to get a doctorate here. 
Well, they never told me that. Didn't you know

17:03.839 --> 17:04.620
that? Norval, I don't understand that. How did you 
do? Well, I made an A. I said, well, I made a B. But,

17:09.245 --> 17:11.068
man, it was a tough course. But I knew I couldn't get 
out here without it. Badgett said, my advisor said

17:13.631 --> 17:15.893
I didn't have to take that. Oh, yes, you do too, 
Johnny. You do too. We called the secretary of the

17:20.442 --> 17:24.711
math department, Sherry Kovar. Her husband was a 
football player at A&M. We said, we're sending

17:28.219 --> 17:30.003
somebody up there now. We've already told him he's 
got to have complex variables. You tell him when he

17:33.450 --> 17:35.394
comes in there that he's got to have it. He's going 
to come up with his degree plan. Well, we said,

17:37.920 --> 17:39.463
Badgett? You've got to have it. He went crazy. He 
goes running up his academic building. He goes

17:44.013 --> 17:47.817
running up to the fourth floor, wherever 
mathematics was, knocks on the door, goes in. Who

17:48.237 --> 17:50.820
says I have to have mathematics? I barely passed 
freshman algebra. How could I? He was going crazy.

17:55.505 --> 17:58.509
If you don't believe me, you can go in and see our 
department head. He said, yeah, I'll just see him.

18:00.991 --> 18:03.274
Well, Norval and I had sneaked into the back of the 
room. We go, we start laughing. He turns around.

18:07.244 --> 18:08.486
I'm not going to tell you what he yelled at us. He had 
on big old leather shoes. We had on tennis shoes.

18:11.191 --> 18:13.194
We're running around the rotunda as fast as we can 
run. He's yelling and screaming at us. We run down

18:14.356 --> 18:18.102
the steps, and everybody on that fourth floor was 
out wondering what was going on. So that, complex

18:18.683 --> 18:20.966
variables. That's in, well, I wrote that up in Good 
Bull, too, I think. Because, you know, graduate

18:25.614 --> 18:28.559
students coming in don't believe anything the 
other students say. You can scare them to death.

18:30.962 --> 18:31.303
Now, the In the early years, the typical graduate 
student was a native Texan. Yes. Male. Male. And

18:41.107 --> 18:42.649
I'll tell you another interesting thing. The 
first group of students who came in here in the

18:43.430 --> 18:51.982
1960s, in the 1960s, we had an African-American 
named Jim Johnson. The truth of the matter is there

18:53.144 --> 18:56.589
was another Jim Johnson. They didn't know this Jim 
Johnson was an African-American. He came in by

18:59.773 --> 19:01.155
default. And got his PhD, went and retired from 
Texas Southern University. But that was a mistake

19:06.366 --> 19:13.373
at the time because there were no black students 
here until 67, 68, basically. And he didn't have

19:13.654 --> 19:14.895
any problems? No, he was great. Great. We'd slip up 
and say the wrong things occasionally. And he'd

19:19.760 --> 19:20.561
correct us. But I'll never forget that. By the time 
you got here, There were women. Yes. Yes. Did you

19:30.553 --> 19:38.104
have any impression of how, in the department and 
in the college, how were the women and minorities

19:30.553 --> 19:38.104
received in the 70s? Well, it was so unusual to see 
them, except we had them coming in graduate

19:38.444 --> 19:46.556
programs in the summers and those kinds of things. 
They were certainly in the minority. And we had

19:49.240 --> 19:54.447
Kamel Maghrabi, for instance, who's, I'm the 
first American graduate from the PhD program in

19:54.730 --> 19:58.093
education at Texas A&M. Wesley Summers was 
second. He was former superintendent in Bryan.

20:01.136 --> 20:05.160
But Kamel Maghrabi from Jordan was first, because 
he'd already been here a year. And he transferred

20:05.660 --> 20:07.702
most of his work to education. So we had quite a few 
international students, because we had to take

20:08.242 --> 20:12.626
French, Russian, or German. Then we had to have two 
languages in the early PhD program. And so it

20:15.930 --> 20:23.016
seemed to me that the acceptance of minorities 
There wasn't any exclusion, but there was

20:23.435 --> 20:30.202
certainly no effort to recruit minority students 
that I can remember. Some of the women were

20:31.103 --> 20:35.908
beginning to come into the programs who were 
heading for principalships. Very little

20:36.349 --> 20:38.050
emphasis on superintendency. Certainly some 
emphasis on higher ed. We had some women go to

20:39.512 --> 20:43.276
higher education early on out of our programs. But 
no, there wasn't much effort to recruit anybody

20:43.336 --> 20:46.880
but the white male. And Frank Hubert's role in 
supporting the program?

20:53.489 --> 20:58.794
I think without Frank Hoover, we wouldn't have had 
the doctoral program, even though Dr. Hensling

20:53.489 --> 20:58.794
did most of the legwork. He had his own set way of 
thinking about what a doctor should be because he

21:00.435 --> 21:07.942
was so influenced by his work in government and 
education from the University of Texas.

21:09.383 --> 21:18.031
Probably, he was probably, in my opinion, he 
probably was not field-oriented enough. He was

21:20.073 --> 21:22.095
probably not... as sensitive to the public 
schools at the time, even though he was a power

21:22.767 --> 21:33.515
player with the Coordinating Board and with the 
State Board of Education, with J.W. Edgar and

21:33.535 --> 21:34.718
those kind of people. It was really kind of the old 
kingdom kind of deanship. It really was. Now, the

21:41.587 --> 21:50.578
other major players at the doctoral level in 
education administration in that era statewide

21:41.587 --> 21:50.578
were whom? Well, Larry Haskew, University of 
Texas. Very, very big name. I admired him a great

21:55.845 --> 21:57.888
deal. He

21:58.609 --> 22:04.797
was probably the major player. Then the schools 
that had the big programs Yeah. UT Austin, who

22:08.794 --> 22:10.176
else? UT Austin, University of Houston had 
started their program. Texas Tech had a pretty big

22:14.162 --> 22:16.767
program. And that was it. That was it. Baylor 
didn't have theirs at the time. TCU did not have

22:22.816 --> 22:26.562
one. SMU. Were you all deliberately trying to 
pattern yourselves after anybody else? I think

22:35.077 --> 22:35.758
so. The study I did pretty much said, here's what a 
doctoral program looks like. So many hours,

22:39.884 --> 22:46.653
languages, so much statistics, dissertation 
quality, how many committees you got to have, how

22:39.884 --> 22:46.653
long it takes. So yeah, I think the UT program 
influenced us a lot. But the UT program is very

22:50.538 --> 22:55.245
similar to the most good doctoral programs around 
the nation in terms of your admission process,

22:55.698 --> 23:01.007
what did you have on a GRE, and things like that. 
After you got here, what was your first big

23:02.028 --> 23:06.476
publication, your first big achievement?

23:09.000 --> 23:10.422
Got here in 75.

23:14.569 --> 23:21.300
Probably,

23:14.569 --> 23:21.300
in terms of publications,

23:24.183 --> 23:41.900
I had some things published in

23:24.183 --> 23:41.900
the Phi Delta Kappa, which is well read, and I had a 
piece published in the Education Administration

23:24.183 --> 23:41.900
Quarterly, which is kind of our flagship. And then 
my first book was in 1985, co-authored with Finn

23:42.600 --> 23:52.890
McEnglish and Betty Steffi, which became sort of a 
a landmark piece for Skills for Successful School

23:53.225 --> 23:59.951
Leaders, which is now the Skills for 21st Century 
School Leaders. We just published it again two

23:59.991 --> 24:04.015
years ago, and it's become sort of a bestseller in 
our field. A lot of articles for journals and

24:04.615 --> 24:08.119
things like that during those early years. Do you 
think those publications helped attract

24:08.779 --> 24:11.602
students? Oh, there's no question about it. Now, I 
presume you all didn't do much deliberate

24:14.424 --> 24:17.667
recruitment. No, we did not. We did not. But I 
started in having people who had read some of my

24:24.342 --> 24:29.608
stuff encouraged their students to come to Texas 
A&M. Now, in the college,

24:30.289 --> 24:42.925
by the time we got to the mid-'70s, the department, 
what were the other departments in the college?

24:42.945 --> 24:53.117
They were curriculum instruction, educational 
psychology, the department of, I guess what we

24:42.945 --> 24:53.117
called industrial education that was very big, 
you know, with Jim Boone and that bunch. Health and

25:01.956 --> 25:04.580
physical education, now kinesiology. And that 
was it. Who were the key people in those various

25:08.686 --> 25:14.314
departments in the 70s? In the 70s, in EDCI, I 
guess, Looking back on it, Glenn Johnson,

25:20.603 --> 25:33.443
Bob Schutz,

25:20.603 --> 25:33.443
key players who were very influential in what took 
place. In industrial education, Jim Boone, James

25:34.084 --> 25:38.671
Boone. I'm trying to think. Oh, he's retired now.

25:48.734 --> 25:51.999
Oh, gosh, he did a lot of writing, a lot of work. I 
can't think of his name. His wife teaches at Blinn

25:53.080 --> 25:57.427
College, and he's an Aggie himself. Kinesiology, 
of course, still Dr. Landis. Carl Landis. Carl

26:03.936 --> 26:11.087
Landis was just a legend, one of the finest 
scholars in kines or health and physical PE he'll

26:03.936 --> 26:11.087
ever have. Tishler had retired by that time. Of 
course, Coming in to that department, they had

26:19.025 --> 26:27.735
Homer Tolson.

26:34.524 --> 26:46.618
I'm trying to think, Dowell, a fellow named 
Dowell, D-O-W-E-L-L. And

26:34.524 --> 26:46.618
Charlie Shea was new. But that was pretty much it. 
Y'all were the only one that was graduate only. We

26:53.760 --> 26:55.282
were the only one graduate only. That's right. And 
in terms of number of graduate students, y'all and

26:56.483 --> 27:03.332
who else was big? EDCI? EDCI and us were the larger 
programs. At that time, health and physical

27:09.329 --> 27:17.441
education had a really good general degree for 
people who wanted to teach physical education at

27:09.329 --> 27:17.441
small colleges and universities. They were 
pretty big at that time. When they went strictly

27:18.823 --> 27:24.250
Kniece, more toward the scientific approach, and 
cut that program out, they'd become much smaller.

27:27.535 --> 27:34.425
Dean Hubert becomes chancellor in the late 70s. 
Were y'all, were faculty members aware that that

27:34.979 --> 27:39.364
was about to happen? Not at all, because we'd been 
concerned about his health. And he'd gotten out

27:43.869 --> 27:47.613
because he was just, you know, getting tired. And 
the next thing I know, he was invited for a cup of

27:47.753 --> 27:52.918
coffee. And I know that's because I'd talked with 
him, invited for a cup of coffee. And he said, well,

27:57.664 --> 27:59.245
I'd like you to be our chancellor. And I never shall 
forget this one. You may or may not use this. Dr.

28:04.139 --> 28:05.861
Miller was president. I'd been offered a 
deanship. I go over to Dr. Miller, and I say,

28:10.046 --> 28:19.776
Jarvis, is there any opportunity for me in terms of 
the deanship at Texas A&M? It's the only deanship

28:19.816 --> 28:21.418
I'd even consider. And I said, I realize when 
you're a homeboy, sometimes your dirty laundry

28:22.700 --> 28:28.706
and all those kinds of issues are there. But I said, 
I've got a deanship offer here. And he turned to me

28:33.130 --> 28:37.175
and he said, well, I don't know what my future is 
here. He said, anytime you have a chancellor who's

28:38.276 --> 28:45.425
counting paperclips and telling you exactly what 
to do every day, I don't even know what my future is.

28:46.586 --> 28:47.427
I'll never forget that. About when was this? That 
was about two or three months after he'd become

28:49.069 --> 28:54.415
chancellor, after Hubert had become chancellor. 
Oh, okay. And the friction was already there. He

28:58.560 --> 29:02.665
said, when I've got people coming and counting my 
paperclips, I don't know what I'm going to do. And I

29:03.252 --> 29:07.917
said, well, I've got a decision to make because I 
went through anguish. Next thing I know, I'm on the

29:07.957 --> 29:09.538
Athletic Council. Chuck Sampson, who was then 
head of the Athletic Council, later was interim

29:11.100 --> 29:16.465
president. Marvin Tate was athletic director. 
And they appointed me to the Athletic Council. And

29:21.750 --> 29:24.253
I was on that for eight years, along with Tom 
Chandler. I mean, Tom Adair, some wonderful

29:24.313 --> 29:28.597
people. And that was a year when the Athletic 
Council really in my opinion, had a lot of

29:32.108 --> 29:33.850
influence. And when Jackie Sherrill came in, the 
friction started between me and him because I was

29:34.450 --> 29:42.539
chairing a blue ribbon committee on eligibility 
and those kinds of things. And then after he left,

29:43.380 --> 29:56.293
then the whole tenor of the faculty senate, I mean 
the athletic council started changing because

29:43.380 --> 29:56.293
the faculty senate wanted to have their hand in it 
because they thought maybe they're, the council

29:56.729 --> 30:19.958
wasn't tough enough on the athletic program, 
typical kind of thing, and I was off Dr. Boynton,

29:56.729 --> 30:19.958
Dr., I forget who the president was at the time, I 
guess it was Frank, appointed me, Vandiver,

29:56.729 --> 30:19.958
appointed me to two terms, then I finished out 
another term for somebody else, but it was a good

29:56.729 --> 30:19.958
time. As far as you know, how did you get on the 
council in the first place? I think Marvin Tate's

30:26.716 --> 30:27.457
nominated me. I think Dr. Miller. He was already, 
Marvin was already the AD? He was the AD, and I think

30:33.387 --> 30:41.020
a conversation with Miller and him, and then Chuck 
Sampson, who was chair of the council at the time,

30:33.387 --> 30:41.020
agreed. So that Emory was already gone. He was 
already gone. Tom Wilson was the coach. Tom Wilson

30:46.709 --> 30:47.991
was the coach. When they fired Tom Wilson, Tom 
tried to call me and said, John, don't let him do

30:48.011 --> 30:53.500
this. uh... bill romaine who's recently passed 
away uh... bill and i were pretty much couldn't

30:54.357 --> 31:22.710
understand why we'd bring in a million dollar 
coach and treat tom wilson the way the board of

30:54.357 --> 31:22.710
regents had treated him the way uh... the 
university treated tom wilson uh... i never have

30:54.357 --> 31:22.710
appreciated that and i asked uh... the first day we 
brought jackie sherrill in here we interviewed

30:54.357 --> 31:22.710
him over in msc because we were hiding didn't want 
anybody to see us because they didn't know he was on

30:54.357 --> 31:22.710
campus they flew up and got him uh... in a lear jet 
bill uh... who's on the Board of Regents, and Jim

31:23.028 --> 31:25.687
Bond. Billy McKenzie.
