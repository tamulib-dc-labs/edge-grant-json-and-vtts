WEBVTT

00:04.807 --> 00:05.849
Okay. You want to just start by giving us the basic 
information on your rank. Account name, rank, and

00:10.816 --> 00:12.559
service number. Right. Basically. Name, John 
Niffin. My rank in the Marine Corps was a sergeant.

00:19.649 --> 00:26.199
I was in a tank unit, a Marine Corps tank unit, 3rd 
Tank Battalion, Bravo Company. I went to Vietnam

00:27.761 --> 00:33.109
in 1965 and left Vietnam in 1968. I went in the first 
time with the battalion landing team, 3rd

00:33.393 --> 00:46.250
Battalion, 9th Marines, which was the first unit 
that went into Vietnam when the buildup started in

00:33.393 --> 00:46.250
1965. Then I came out just after the Tet Offensive 
in 1968.

00:52.498 --> 00:54.140
You volunteered, right? I volunteered. Nobody 
blamed but myself. Okay. Would you like to go into

00:58.946 --> 01:01.830
maybe why you volunteered to begin with? This is 
essentially greed. I was enrolled in A&M at that

01:03.791 --> 01:11.119
time and my grades weren't really good enough to 
qualify for any kind of scholarship. So I talked to

01:12.981 --> 01:21.029
my local recruiter and he gave me this line about 
the naval enlisted scientific education

01:12.981 --> 01:21.029
program. If I enlisted in the Navy or enlisted in 
the Marine Corps as a regular and I tested high

01:21.269 --> 01:31.800
enough on the qualification test that I would 
continue to gain rank in the reserves, I would be

01:33.215 --> 01:53.125
able to go to college full-time with all my 
tuition, books, and living expenses paid by the

01:33.215 --> 01:53.125
government, and I would have a four-year 
obligation to the Marine Corps upon graduation as

01:33.215 --> 01:53.125
a commissioned officer. So that sounded pretty 
good to me at the time, so I did it. But then I found

01:57.472 --> 02:00.977
out that even though I tested high enough on the 
test that they had, in 1965, they apparently

02:01.531 --> 02:16.878
suspended the NICEF program because they needed, 
I guess they needed more cannon fodder and less

02:01.531 --> 02:16.878
officers or maybe they were already getting 
enough officers. At any rate, I ended up in Vietnam

02:17.119 --> 02:19.823
instead of back in college. Right. What was your 
perception of U.S. involvement early on in 1965?

02:29.206 --> 02:38.838
the myth that if we didn't stop them in Southeast 
Asia, that they'd be putting their elephants in

02:29.206 --> 02:38.838
their sandpans and floating them across the 
Pacific Ocean and attacking San Francisco. San

02:38.858 --> 02:40.720
Francisco next week. Yeah. I mean, you know, 
growing up in Texas and all that, I think I had the

02:41.040 --> 02:50.672
same phobia towards rampant communism as 
everybody else that's brought up in this state.

02:51.193 --> 02:53.335
And at the time, it seemed reasonable. And 
besides, you know, Again, being brought up in

02:57.134 --> 03:05.884
Texas and on John Wayne movies and all that kind of 
stuff, I was sort of gobbled up with the warrior

02:57.134 --> 03:05.884
mystique. Right. Going over there, and either I'd 
get killed or I'd come back like Audie Murphy and

03:07.005 --> 03:22.002
have all kinds of medals and be able to go to 
Hollywood and make movies and never have to work

03:07.005 --> 03:22.002
for a living for the rest of my life. Okay, I know 
that during Tet you were at Hawaii, right? Well,

03:26.463 --> 03:30.708
initially, I came back just at the start of TEP. 
Initially, I was at Quong Tree as part of a

03:30.728 --> 03:35.134
composite company. So they had moved out a unit of 
Marines that was holding Quong Tree, the regular

03:35.514 --> 03:42.063
Marines. And so they ran around and grabbed 
everybody they could find, the people that were

03:42.083 --> 03:52.035
returning from country for leave, cooks, 
messmen, supply clerks, everybody. So we had sort

03:52.275 --> 03:54.478
of a composite company. battalion of half Marines 
and half Navy Seabees at Quantry. And then when we

04:00.662 --> 04:09.991
started to push into way, they discovered that I 
had a tanker MOS and the tank commander had been

04:00.662 --> 04:09.991
wounded in the way. So I went in as his replacement. 
And then after that I ended up trying to bust in the

04:11.552 --> 04:17.378
caseload. Oh dear. You described a little bit of 
the Battle of Hawaii to me. I guess the thing that

04:24.665 --> 04:47.449
comes to mind primarily is this notion that there 
was some sort of a bloodbath, you know, that the

04:24.665 --> 04:47.449
Vietnamese or the NVA or the VC had to intimidate 
and use coercion on the people, the inhabitants of

04:24.665 --> 04:47.449
Guay. That wasn't my impression. My impression 
was that everybody in the city was against, you

04:51.161 --> 05:00.644
know, and I didn't feel they could get that sort of 
cooperation through force and intimidation. And

05:01.085 --> 05:02.248
also, uh, Initially, when we first got into 
Vietnam in 1965, we were allowed to go on liberty.

05:08.543 --> 05:16.074
And so I'd been in the way on liberty and had visited 
the Citadel, which is the ancient capital and

05:08.543 --> 05:16.074
places like that. And it was really beautiful. 
There's a lot of art treasures and everything else

05:19.279 --> 05:21.643
in there. And going in there with tanks and 
everything, we just pretty well destroyed the

05:21.863 --> 05:26.110
city. At the time, I just didn't really care. I 
mean, I had too many of my friends killed, and it

05:29.674 --> 05:38.484
didn't matter to me what I was doing to the 
Vietnamese people or their culture or anything

05:29.674 --> 05:38.484
else. But in retrospect, it bothers me a little bit 
that I participated in destroying one of the

05:38.504 --> 05:52.779
cultural capitals of the world.

05:53.300 --> 05:56.063
You said that then you were in Cape Town after that? 
No, I wasn't in Khe Sanh. That was part of the relief

05:59.136 --> 06:01.459
column. It was a joint operation of the Marines in 
the 1st Cav. It was trying to break through into Khe

06:06.003 --> 06:09.347
Sanh on Highway 9. And it was 3rd Detainee, 4th 
Marines, I believe, 26 Marines was in Khe Sanh. I

06:18.757 --> 06:23.282
was the tank support for the infantry unit that was 
trying to break into Khe Sanh.

06:27.548 --> 06:31.954
Seems like from, you know, it's really fuzzy 
looking back at it this long. It seems like it was

06:32.634 --> 06:44.489
from February to almost early summer, I'd say May 
or June before, you know, things were pretty

06:32.634 --> 06:44.489
passed by. I mean, up until then, it was pretty much 
a free fire zone. We couldn't operate except in,

06:48.655 --> 06:53.301
you know, great strength. We'd get taken out. 
Okay, by that time, troop strength in Vietnam was

06:55.966 --> 07:00.934
about at its peak. I would say, yeah, about 10,000. 
You're talking about 500,000 to 550,000 men in

07:03.278 --> 07:08.646
Vietnam. What kind of differences in attitudes, 
or if any, did you see of the people that were coming

07:09.668 --> 07:16.439
in then from the 1 to the 10 early on? I don't know if 
there's differences in attitudes in the 1 coming

07:18.602 --> 07:23.290
in, but you have to understand something that The 
old salts didn't associate with the new guys.

07:31.561 --> 07:41.250
You

07:31.561 --> 07:41.250
had your people that you'd been with for a while 
that you could depend on, and the new guys were an

07:31.561 --> 07:41.250
unproven quality. Plus, you didn't want to make 
friends with somebody that might not be around the

07:41.630 --> 07:48.257
next day. The newer arrivals, you didn't really 
care what their attitude was.

07:55.805 --> 08:06.096
There was an attitude with the people that had been 
in the country for a while because before, you

07:55.805 --> 08:06.096
know, we were all going to go out and make contact 
with the enemy. By this time, we were sort of at the

08:06.136 --> 08:11.362
opinion, heck with that, you know, we're going to 
stay alive. So they'd send us out on these ambush

08:11.402 --> 08:16.027
patrols and things like that. And we'd go up and set 
up just far enough forward of the wires that they

08:17.028 --> 08:23.955
wouldn't be able to hear us, you know.

08:29.403 --> 08:30.845
play these John Wayne games anymore. We're going 
to stay alive. And that wasn't initially, you

08:32.668 --> 08:36.694
know, that was unheard of. You know, we were, heck 
yeah, let's go out and fight and die for our

08:36.915 --> 08:41.201
country. By 1968, there didn't seem to be as much of 
that. The business, like what was happening later

08:45.228 --> 08:54.622
on, you know, as I understand the early 70s, you 
know, where units, whole units were refusing to

08:45.228 --> 08:54.622
engage the army. You know, that wasn't happening. 
It wasn't. It was just local small units and squads

08:57.736 --> 09:01.480
and patrols. And it wasn't that they flat-told 
their officers they weren't going to do it. They

09:04.944 --> 09:09.169
just didn't bother to go where they were supposed 
to go. One statement that's been made by a number of

09:09.189 --> 09:24.267
different people that have talked to our class

09:09.189 --> 09:24.267
in response to various things is the unique 
experience that everybody in Vietnam has more

09:24.922 --> 09:29.707
group experiences in other situations. It's a 
very, very personal war. Everybody's experience

09:32.470 --> 09:36.094
is different.

09:37.275 --> 09:44.382
As opposed to perhaps World War II, where you know 
who the enemy is, you know there's good and bad. Did

09:46.465 --> 09:51.029
that hold with your experience during that time? 
I'm not sure I really understand the question,

09:51.049 --> 09:53.612
June. What

09:53.828 --> 10:21.642
has been said on several people that were there is 
that,

09:53.828 --> 10:21.642
I guess it's kind of a sociological thing, in some 
of the earlier wars where it was real clear what was

09:53.828 --> 10:21.642
going on, you knew who you were fighting,

09:53.828 --> 10:21.642
experiences of one person would not be that vastly 
different from those of another person. Whereas,

10:22.330 --> 10:32.622
in Vietnam,

10:22.330 --> 10:32.622
everybody's experiences were so atomized and so 
different. You might walk up on a little kid and be

10:33.984 --> 10:37.247
blown away. You just don't know.

10:41.693 --> 10:43.975
You know, I've heard a lot of those kind of stories. 
I think there's one thing that did, people that

10:44.876 --> 10:52.185
didn't,

10:44.876 --> 10:52.185
that weren't Vietnami to realize, You had several 
different theaters of operation, and my

10:52.621 --> 11:03.297
impression in talking to some of the Army people 
and things like that, that there were several

10:52.621 --> 11:03.297
different types of war going on. For instance, I 
never got further south than Danau, and that was

11:03.417 --> 11:09.406
only coming in and going out. Most of my time, my 
tour of duty was spent way up north, just below the

11:09.526 --> 11:15.675
Ben Hai River. As a consequence, most of the troops 
that the enemy that we were engaged in were not VC.

11:22.716 --> 11:25.720
They weren't little kids with hand grenades that 
you hear these stories about. They were regular

11:25.740 --> 11:28.763
troops, more Vietnam troops. And so, my way of 
thinking it was pretty much a traditional war.

11:33.949 --> 11:44.802
Pretty much as much so as World War II, where you 
were engaging battalion and regimental and

11:33.949 --> 11:44.802
divisional size NVA units for the most part. As 
opposed to, say, somebody that might be in the

11:45.254 --> 11:59.160
two-quarter area, you know, down Central 
Highlands, the middle of the country, that were

11:45.254 --> 11:59.160
dealing more with local VC units, you know, that 
were friendly farmers by day and VC by night. You

11:59.200 --> 12:01.885
know, it wasn't that way. There did... I wouldn't 
say it's exactly a growing experience, but there

12:05.875 --> 12:18.590
was a change in attitude in that when I initially 
went over there, you know, like I said, it was all

12:05.875 --> 12:18.590
gung-ho, guiding country, home and corn, all that 
sort of thing. And that didn't last very long, I'd

12:18.610 --> 12:21.994
say a couple of months. And then it was just sort of 
marking time until I could do something neat like

12:22.374 --> 12:29.723
going on and on to Hong Kong or Sydney, Australia or 
something like that. And then you, and real close

12:29.703 --> 12:41.177
partner, get blown away, you know, and then it was a 
revenge trip after that, you know, you just wanted

12:29.703 --> 12:41.177
to waste goose. And I know that was my evolution, I 
can't say that, you know, that I was, I feel I was

12:41.197 --> 12:51.169
typical, but then, you know, everybody likes to 
feel that they're reborn, you know. That's the way

12:51.189 --> 12:53.652
I, my experience, you know. But also, you know, 
since I was there from 65 to 68, I saw different

12:55.302 --> 13:02.853
phases of the war. You know, from the beginning in 
1965, our mission principally was the defense of

13:02.873 --> 13:09.363
the denying airstrip. And I really had the 
impression that the VC, I don't know if they even

13:09.383 --> 13:16.433
were in the NBA,

13:20.193 --> 13:21.755
the Americans. They just wanted to leave us alone. 
And then towards 66 and 67, things got a little more

13:24.019 --> 13:29.286
serious. We weren't making a lot of contact within 
the units. My attitude sort of changed

13:33.532 --> 13:36.417
correspondingly. But initially it was a big joke. 
Here I am over in the combat zone. We're not having

13:39.922 --> 13:40.823
fun. I get free mail and privileges. I don't have to 
pay income tax. All I have to do is write three of my

13:44.168 --> 13:47.613
letters to send it home. It was great.

13:51.631 --> 13:57.517
And that all changed pretty rapidly. Yeah. Well, 
I'd say it changed very rapidly.

14:07.168 --> 14:16.057
By August 1965, the Marines had engaged just south 
of Chula. I think it was called Operation

14:16.077 --> 14:18.600
Starlight. And from then on, I guess the 
Vietnamese finally realized that we weren't

14:19.002 --> 14:27.492
going to go away by just ignoring us. So from then 
on, our bases in Da Nang and other places like that

14:27.512 --> 14:37.224
were being mortared and later rocketed. We were 
getting mines and booby traps and things like that

14:37.244 --> 14:41.029
in the bills. And then after I moved up north,

14:57.325 --> 15:03.774
Okay, let's get into a little bit of your 
involvement in the VDAW after you moved back. How

15:03.794 --> 15:07.839
did you get involved in that and why? How did your 
perceptions change by the time you got involved

15:07.979 --> 15:13.407
with the VDAW? You know, when I first got back, I 
thought I was some kind of a psychotic. I was real

15:18.790 --> 15:20.052
isolated. I was going to school in Houston at San 
Jacinto Junior College, but I just felt no rapport

15:20.653 --> 15:32.249
whatsoever with the other students. I didn't 
really want to socialize with them. I didn't want

15:34.132 --> 15:41.963
them to know I was a veteran because I didn't want to 
have to defend my position while I was in Vietnam

15:34.132 --> 15:41.963
and all that kind of stuff. And I guess the first 
thing that really disturbed me is I came back.

15:48.440 --> 15:51.463
Marine Corps at the end of July of 1968. So I was back 
in Houston working for the phone company and

15:52.264 --> 16:00.654
trying to go to school by August when the 
conventions were over. And watching what was

16:00.674 --> 16:05.700
going on at the Democratic Convention was just 
really upsetting to me. I mean, if I had been

16:05.820 --> 16:15.831
fighting in Vietnam for freedom and democracy for 
the Vietnamese people, then what in hell had

16:05.820 --> 16:15.831
happened in my country while I was gone, you know, 
when you can see

16:20.198 --> 16:21.281
and stuff like that. But I still wasn't, I would 
say, a really political person. That didn't

16:29.623 --> 16:32.470
really occur until 1971, when the Vets, what later 
became VVAW, went to Washington, D.C. and won

16:33.125 --> 16:41.934
three of the medals. That just really impressed 
me. And, you know, I've met Kathy and married by

16:43.917 --> 16:46.860
then. She was telling me, instead of just sitting 
back there cussing the television set every

16:47.500 --> 17:00.234
night, you know, when Nixon would come on and talk 
about what a wonderful job we were doing over

16:47.500 --> 17:00.234
there, maybe I'll think about getting involved in 
doing things. I just... didn't really want to do

17:01.778 --> 17:14.333
it, I had tried to participate in the first student 
mobe anti-war march, which I guess was in 1969 in

17:01.778 --> 17:14.333
Houston. And I told them that I had some 
photographs of way, and that they could compare

17:14.353 --> 17:25.727
these photographs with photographs of Life 
magazine, and they could see the kind of damage

17:29.858 --> 17:40.347
The response I got from these enlightened campus 
radicals was that they really didn't want any form

17:29.858 --> 17:40.347
of professional killers in their peace march. And 
I said, OK, it's fine with me. So I just pulled in my

17:41.989 --> 17:44.891
horns and went back to work for the phone company. 
And that's pretty much where I was until the BVAW

17:45.251 --> 17:51.417
Dewey Canyon III business. And then after Dewey 
Canyon III, this individual I was telling about,

17:51.437 --> 17:59.764
Terry DeVoe,

18:00.790 --> 18:09.925
I was wandering around campus at UT with those 
signs that said, Vietnam vets, please talk to me,

18:00.790 --> 18:09.925
trying to get people involved in VBAW. And they 
were fixing to do a dedication at the LBJ library.

18:15.153 --> 18:19.660
So we had a meeting in Austin, and Kathy talked me 
into going down there. So I got together with these

18:20.787 --> 18:22.553
people. At first, I was appalled by some of them. I 
mean, some of the people that were there, I don't

18:25.463 --> 18:32.367
know whether they were police agents or what, but 
some of the suggestions of an agent

18:35.941 --> 18:43.573
I mean, there was one guy that wanted to go to a 
simulated guerrilla theater, you know, and

18:35.941 --> 18:43.573
attack the LBJ library, you know, and throw smoke 
bombs and firecrackers. And I just did not think

18:43.633 --> 18:49.443
that was a good idea at all, you know, with the 
president and everybody else on hand, you know.

18:49.463 --> 18:53.970
Throwing anything that goes bang at them just 
seemed like a real good way to get a whole lot of

18:49.463 --> 18:53.970
people killed. But Kerry was a really exceptional 
individual, and he and I had sort of an instant

18:54.991 --> 19:02.303
rapport.

19:03.667 --> 19:11.815
Later, he ended up coming over to my house, and we 
silkscreened a whole lot of DBAW banners at our

19:03.667 --> 19:11.815
house for the demonstration. Got to talking, 
found out through his experiences and my

19:11.835 --> 19:15.519
experience. He's from Brownfield, Texas.

19:20.785 --> 19:24.789
Somebody grew up in Del Rio, Val Verde County. Both 
of us coming from West Texas. We had a pretty good

19:27.151 --> 19:29.714
rapport. We both knew where our heads were when we 
got over there. When had he been in? He had,

19:36.660 --> 19:41.206
I'm not sure exactly. He was a Army, he was a 
Lieutenant for Green Berets, and I believe he'd

19:41.246 --> 19:47.455
been over there essentially the same time as I had. 
I'm not sure the exact date, so. Yeah, pretty

19:49.878 --> 19:51.240
early. Well, this was 1972, you know, and he 
already had long hair and a beard, so he'd been out

19:51.260 --> 19:58.690
for a while. I think he got back approximately the 
same time I did, maybe.

20:07.285 --> 20:11.809
Well, we wanted to go throw our medals away. Well, 
first of all, you know, that's the first

20:12.129 --> 20:16.473
experience I had with the counterculture 
politics. You know, I was not even left to believe

20:16.493 --> 20:22.219
that if you were against the war, you know, that you 
were all on the same side. And so we were

20:22.239 --> 20:29.445
encountering what they call the trots, the 
Socialist Workers Party and all their people. And

20:29.826 --> 20:33.909
they were trying to co-opt everybody for their 
demonstration. And then, you know, VBAW

20:39.263 --> 20:47.693
because of the business in Washington, D.C., you 
know, all the other movement organizations sort

20:39.263 --> 20:47.693
of wanted to get there, you know, and there seemed 
to be some kind of a catch. So everybody was tugging

20:47.713 --> 20:53.820
at us, you know, and we were all kind of like we were 
being pulled from one side to the other. And I don't

20:53.840 --> 20:57.625
think any of us had any real clear-cut politics, 
you know. I mean, we weren't Marxist, we weren't

20:57.645 --> 21:00.428
Socialist, you know. We weren't even good 
Democrats or Republicans. We were just out there.

21:06.380 --> 21:12.070
So, we finally decided we were just going to 
divorce ourselves from all these groups and do our

21:06.380 --> 21:12.070
own thing.

21:14.253 --> 21:20.203
We discussed the possibility of civil 
disobedience, but non-violent civil

21:14.253 --> 21:20.203
disobedience. We didn't want to get in trouble. We 
wanted to make our point, and if there were, like

21:24.185 --> 21:35.842
for instance, there was an injunction going that 
supposedly limited us, I think a half a mile from

21:24.185 --> 21:35.842
the LBJ library or something like that. So we just 
decided, well, that's a crock, you know, that's

21:35.862 --> 21:41.611
clearly unconstitutional. So we weren't doing a 
baby injunction. That was one of the points the

21:43.614 --> 21:45.957
trots were making. We were going to get everybody 
arrested if we crossed the deadline.

21:52.272 --> 22:06.273
But we approached the barricade and talked to some 
Secret Service people and told them what we were

21:52.272 --> 22:06.273
there for and that we had no intention of 
threatening anybody, you know, but we didn't want

21:52.272 --> 22:06.273
to make a political statement. We wanted to turn 
our decorations in. He says that there's no way

22:07.915 --> 22:11.621
that we weren't going to cross the barricade. He 
says, well... about if we delegate one individual

22:12.650 --> 22:21.401
and all you guys can escort him up there and he can 
act on behalf of all of us. So that's not going to

22:21.421 --> 22:23.564
work either. So, you know, there is some talk 
about, well, let's force the barricade, and we

22:23.584 --> 22:33.276
finally decided that wasn't going to be 
productive, so we just chunked our mills across

22:23.584 --> 22:33.276
the barricade. The Secret Service was busy 
collecting them all up, and I guess Tech and Cereal

22:33.296 --> 22:38.623
is going to be staying to find out who we're going to 
work with.

22:43.598 --> 22:57.041
And after that, after spending the day at the LBJ 
library and watching people getting tear gassed

22:43.598 --> 22:57.041
and cops chasing people down the street, my wife 
and I ended up going on a run with a bandito's

22:43.598 --> 22:57.041
motorcycle.

23:00.387 --> 23:03.312
So there were some problems there that day. I 
wouldn't say it was any serious problems, but

23:04.642 --> 23:10.672
there were a few people that were throwing things, 
and the cops were responding. There was some tear

23:10.692 --> 23:16.261
gas set off at one point. I don't really know how 
many people were arrested, but it wasn't any of the

23:16.281 --> 23:23.393
big mass arrests that occurred later on.

23:27.423 --> 23:33.652
The first one I ever did, I guess, I can't say 
whether it was typical or not for the time, but it

23:27.423 --> 23:33.652
seemed pretty typical. In general, it was pretty 
peaceful. Were you involved in the VVAW even

23:37.278 --> 23:42.346
ongoingly after that? Well, I sort of got conned 
into taking the position initially the resource

23:48.162 --> 23:57.613
person for the local University of Texas, and then 
later the Austin chapter coordinator of Vietnam

23:48.162 --> 23:57.613
Veterans Against the War. And then Terry, by that 
time, was having some problems. And so in December

24:02.078 --> 24:11.128
of 71, Terry resigned. And I found myself as the 
state coordinator for the regional coordinator.

24:17.896 --> 24:24.368
Did you ever have any personal problems arise as a 
result of that? Oh, yeah. In fact, all of my arrest

24:25.350 --> 24:33.666
records all stem from my involvement with the VAW. 
Initially, on Veterans Day 1971,

24:41.116 --> 24:45.563
We were arrested for parading without a permit on 
the sidewalk in Killeen. And then later in 1972,

24:47.205 --> 24:57.240
when they started the offensive, the Vietnamese 
started their 1972 offensive. And Nixon was

24:57.420 --> 25:09.098
telling everybody that he'd do anything to stop 
the Vietnamese incursion in the south with the

24:57.420 --> 25:09.098
exception of reintroduction of ground troops and 
the use of nuclear weapons. VVAW had a lot of guys in

25:09.837 --> 25:16.790
active duty, you know, that were soul brothers of 
the organization. So they were telling us, you

25:17.631 --> 25:25.746
know, we were getting these calls from all these 
military bases and they were telling us what their

25:17.631 --> 25:25.746
alert status was, what their deployment status 
was. And when you put it all together, it became

25:25.766 --> 25:31.356
very apparent that what was happening was that 
Nixon was...

25:34.880 --> 25:39.909
started compiling all this as sort of an 
organizational thing. And that started a bunch of

25:39.929 --> 25:42.193
demonstrations. And I got arrested for 
aggravated assault on a police officer in one of

25:42.213 --> 25:46.781
those demonstrations in Austin. And then it sort 
of culminated in a conspiracy case. BVAW was

25:53.105 --> 25:58.232
planning to attend the Democratic National 
Convention. I can't speak for the organization,

25:59.034 --> 26:05.643
but I myself had no intention of going to the 
Republican Convention. What was the point? We all

26:07.025 --> 26:10.270
knew who the Republican candidate was going to be. 
And whereas you might be able to influence the

26:10.638 --> 26:17.032
Democratic candidates, there was no way you were 
going to change Nixon's mind. So we were holding

26:17.052 --> 26:23.787
meetings and discussing what to do about the 
Democratic convention. And it was decided that we

26:23.807 --> 26:28.157
would have a convoy from... There was essentially 
three branches, one coming down the east coast,

26:28.593 --> 26:38.244
one coming across from the west coast, and one 
coming down from the midwest off of Virgin and

26:28.593 --> 26:38.244
Florida. We called it the last patrol. We'd go to 
the convention. We were having meetings and

26:42.929 --> 26:45.352
discussions on this. One of our meetings was 
infiltrated by an agent provocateur, a guy named

26:46.373 --> 26:54.482
Bill Linger.

26:56.015 --> 27:05.641
saying we knew we were on trial for conspiracy, but 
the government's charge was that we were

26:56.015 --> 27:05.641
inspiring to disrupt the Republican convention. 
And the grand jury sat during the Democratic

27:05.661 --> 27:11.357
convention, so all of us were... It exactly 
coincided with the Democratic Convention. Our

27:15.488 --> 27:24.320
subpoenas ordered us to appear at the day the 
Democratic Convention started, and we were

27:15.488 --> 27:24.320
released from subpoena when the government had 
the nomination. So we were held in Tallahassee at

27:24.340 --> 27:29.046
the other end of the state, all the leadership. And 
I sort of felt like the government felt that VBAW

27:29.707 --> 27:36.636
was like IBM or something. If you get the board of 
directors and take them off someplace, then you

27:39.579 --> 27:44.026
cripple the company. Since VBAW didn't work that 
way at all, we were a bunch of anarchists. The mere

27:47.912 --> 27:59.669
fact that you held the regional coordinators 
someplace didn't change one bit what was going on

27:47.912 --> 27:59.669
with the organization because they were still 
doing what they wanted. The government had it

27:59.689 --> 28:03.535
conspiratorial.

28:08.425 --> 28:17.558
But at any rate, they ended up charging us with a 
conspiracy to cross our state lines to decide a

28:08.425 --> 28:17.558
riot at the Republican National Convention. And 
they said that as part of that conspiracy that we

28:18.348 --> 28:32.485
were going to use slingshots and cherry bombs and 
fried marbles and crossbows against highly

28:18.348 --> 28:32.485
assembled police and military power at the 
convention. In other words, you know, we were

28:32.545 --> 28:42.718
going to be down there shooting at the 82nd 
Airborne and the FBI and the Dade County Sheriff's

28:32.545 --> 28:42.718
Department, you know, with slingshots and 
crossbows.

28:47.693 --> 28:53.907
I was, save one of the defendants, had been in the 
military and had served in Vietnam. I've got to say

28:54.494 --> 29:04.309
one thing about the government, they do teach you 
how to use all these neat weapons, you know, so why

28:54.494 --> 29:04.309
couldn't they come up with anything better to use 
than stone shots, cherry bombs, crossbows, and

28:54.494 --> 29:04.309
pride marbles? But at any rate, they went ahead 
with this farce, you know, and screwed around for a

29:04.470 --> 29:14.726
year with motions on motions to suppress motions 
and things like that. Finally put us on trial about

29:14.906 --> 29:22.678
a year later, and after about a month-long trial, 
the jury came back with an earnest verdict of

29:14.906 --> 29:22.678
acquittal, and we were all cut loose.

29:26.118 --> 29:31.805
It was held in Gainesville, Florida. Everybody 
was acquitted.

29:36.871 --> 29:43.138
Which is good because the way conspiracy works, if 
they had managed to convict one of us, they would

29:36.871 --> 29:43.138
have convicted us all. Conspiracy is not a crime as 
much as a thought, which makes it so dangerous. So

29:50.206 --> 29:55.973
if they had been able to prove that one of us had 
committed a crime, then that could have convicted

29:50.206 --> 29:55.973
us all.

30:01.572 --> 30:03.199
That's the whole thing about conspiracy. You 
know, I often thought when they tried Mitchell and

30:03.561 --> 30:10.350
Stans for conspiracy, you know, The government 
had lost all their other conspiracy cases, you

30:10.921 --> 30:18.571
know, the Chicago case, the Oregon case, and the 
Seattle case, and our case. I often thought that

30:18.591 --> 30:27.303
some hot shot lawyer in the Justice Department was 
sitting there saying, you know, we've got to try

30:18.591 --> 30:27.303
and mention them stands for something the 
American people want most, and let them off for

30:18.591 --> 30:27.303
nothing. So somebody says, well, let's try them 
for conspiracy. We never won on that one before.

30:32.030 --> 30:38.058
And lo and behold, the first time they get a 
conviction on conspiracy is against Mitchell and

30:32.030 --> 30:38.058
Stanton. Sort of an ironic justice thing.

31:03.402 --> 31:06.023
But did that case have a name? Yeah.
