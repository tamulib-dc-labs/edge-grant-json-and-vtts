00:12.316 --> 00:21.550
In this seesaw of techniques, the side which 
counted quickly before the opponent had time to

00:12.316 --> 00:21.550
perfect the new tactics and weapons had a decided 
advantage. Operations research, bringing

00:22.151 --> 00:33.629
scientists in to analyze the technical import of 
the fluctuations between measure and

00:22.151 --> 00:33.629
countermeasure, made it possible to speed up our 
reaction rate in several critical cases. This is

00:34.049 --> 00:36.433
on page 136 and continuing. Likewise, in their 
struggle to counter our improved convoy escort

00:37.223 --> 00:47.575
tactics, the U-boats introduced the acoustic 
torpedo, which steers for a ship by listening to

00:37.223 --> 00:47.575
the sound it makes underwater. Our development of 
countermeasures was based on studies of the

00:48.276 --> 01:00.591
operations research group into the pattern of 
sound produced by the sea, in the sea by ship's

00:48.276 --> 01:00.591
propellers, and on the probable reaction of the 
torpedo to various decoy devices. In this end, and

01:00.631 --> 01:06.538
in other cases, information derived from 
intelligence. and interpreted by the members of

01:07.025 --> 01:16.482
the group in the light of their own scientific 
knowledge and was utilized to devise improved

01:07.025 --> 01:16.482
countermeasures. Submarine and anti-submarine 
operations are closely complementary. Methods

01:21.451 --> 01:27.261
developed for attack have to have as a counterpart 
methods for defense based on the principles

01:21.451 --> 01:27.261
underlying both. In the subgroup devoted to 
submarine warfare, theoretical and operational

01:28.017 --> 01:55.756
studies were carried out on the coordination of 
attack by groups of submarines, torpedo fire

01:28.017 --> 01:55.756
control, the effectiveness of rescue of downed 
aviators, causes of loss of the United States

01:28.017 --> 01:55.756
submarines, the relative merits of various types 
of torpedoes under different circumstances, and

01:28.017 --> 01:55.756
enemy countermeasures to our radar search 
equipment.

01:55.776 --> 01:56.978
On page 137. The assistance and cooperation of 
industry and science have been indispensable.

02:02.234 --> 02:11.588
Without this assistance, many of the weapons 
which have come into being as a result of intensive

02:02.234 --> 02:11.588
wartime research and development otherwise 
never would have been completed and introduced

02:02.234 --> 02:11.588
into the fleet. It had often been predicted that in 
a national emergency, the totalitarian

02:13.251 --> 02:25.429
countries would have a great technical advantage 
over the democracies because of their ability to

02:13.251 --> 02:25.429
regiment scientific facilities and manpower at 
will. The results achieved by Germany, Italy, and

02:26.590 --> 02:31.518
Japan do not bear out this contention. Studies 
made since the close of the war indicate that in

02:31.538 --> 02:38.950
none of these countries was the scientific effort 
as effectively handled as in the United States.

02:39.571 --> 02:53.593
The rapid, effective, and original results 
obtained in bringing science into our effort are

02:39.571 --> 02:53.593
proof of the responsiveness of our former 
government to meeting emergencies, the

02:39.571 --> 02:53.593
technical competence of American scientists, 
and the productive genius of American industry.

02:55.447 --> 02:56.188
Page 138. Sufficient progress in the technical 
development and use of improved weapons and

02:57.869 --> 03:06.278
associated equipment has been made during the war 
to emphasize the necessity for continued

02:57.869 --> 03:06.278
progress. Working under the stress of an 
emergency, the fact of primary importance was

03:07.319 --> 03:12.844
immediate effectiveness against the enemy. This 
resulted in crash designs and production that

03:13.565 --> 03:24.576
required considerable more personnel, weight, 
and space than the more seasoned designs that

03:13.565 --> 03:24.576
might have been produced had the time been 
available. Thus, the rapid expansion and

03:24.961 --> 03:35.835
development of new weapons and devices during the 
war was often at the cost of factors of major

03:24.961 --> 03:35.835
importance, such as the reserved buoyancy and 
stability of the ships in which they were

03:24.961 --> 03:35.835
installed. Those wartime designs, while they 
have well served their purpose against the enemy,

03:36.576 --> 03:51.795
have nevertheless created problems of 
refinement and improvement in the ultimate

03:36.576 --> 03:51.795
design of equipment, which must be so resolved 
that a minimum of personnel or weight in a space

03:36.576 --> 03:51.795
will be required to attain the desired effect. 
These problems must be energetically attacked in

03:52.450 --> 03:56.396
the coming years of peace. Only by continuing 
vigorous research and development can this

03:57.418 --> 04:10.798
country hope to be protected from any potential 
enemies and maintain the position which it now

03:57.418 --> 04:10.798
enjoys in possessing the greatest effective 
naval fighting force in history.

04:18.169 --> 04:19.251
Page 140. the definition of the Bureau of Ships 
Research and Development.

04:25.276 --> 04:46.318
Quote, All research and development undertaken 
by the Bureau of Ships is directed toward the

04:25.276 --> 04:46.318
development of new or improved materials, 
components, equipments, machinery, systems,

04:25.276 --> 04:46.318
and structural factors entering into the 
construction, maintenance, and operation of

04:25.276 --> 04:46.318
naval vessels to enable these vessels to better 
fulfill their mission. Skipping now to page 240 in

04:48.998 --> 05:10.822
the organizational chart of the Bureau of Ships 
Radio Division, September 1944, we find the head

04:48.998 --> 05:10.822
of the radio division, code 900, Captain J.B. Dow, 
U.S.N. Coming on down, design branch, code 910, We

05:17.770 --> 05:21.256
see Commander Hull and Commander Shepard. And 
then code 914, assistant for radio and sonar,

05:22.438 --> 05:30.511
Commander Ross and Bennett. And down under him, 
code 940, the sonar section, Commander J.C.

05:30.531 --> 05:36.260
Myers.

05:38.945 --> 05:41.449
Those are well-known names in our work.

05:45.631 --> 06:03.789
After discussing the early development of radar, 
on page 238, we quote, in the reorganization of the

05:45.631 --> 06:03.789
two bureaus of shipbuilding into the Bureau of 
Ships in June 1940, the radio division lost its

05:45.631 --> 06:03.789
status and became the radio and sound branch of the 
design division.

06:09.335 --> 06:12.398
There was no radar at this particular time 
Relatively few ships and planes carried

06:13.053 --> 06:16.658
elaborate radio gear. Relatively few ships were 
being built before the war. Then, with

06:20.164 --> 06:38.031
reorganization and declaration of a limited 
emergency, emphasis was placed upon fostering

06:20.164 --> 06:38.031
and coordinating the design and development of 
radio and sound equipment, establishing

06:20.164 --> 06:38.031
military characteristics and setting up 
specifications for their production,

06:20.164 --> 06:38.031
determining ship's allowance, allowances, 
estimating requirements on the basis of those

06:38.382 --> 06:48.814
allowances, and asking the Bureau of Supplies and 
Accounts to procure the equipment on a

06:38.382 --> 06:48.814
competitive bid basis and planning installation 
maintenance. Phase 239, continuing. The extent

06:53.299 --> 06:56.903
to which the electronic program expanded is 
astonishing. In 1940, the Bureau of Ships spent

06:57.263 --> 07:06.173
about $6 million for equipping and maintaining 
ships and shore stations with electronics

06:57.263 --> 07:06.173
equipment and for electronics development work. 
Five years later, The annual figure totaled more

07:08.892 --> 07:12.016
than 1,000 millions. During this time, civilian 
and officer personnel had expanded from 39 in

07:12.617 --> 07:21.670
January 1940 to a total of 1,205 in September 1945. 
The

07:21.750 --> 07:31.064
growth of the electronics program during 1940 and 
1941, however, placed the organization under

07:21.750 --> 07:31.064
great strain. The development of radar seemed to 
require the setting up of a separate unit. The

07:37.883 --> 07:41.569
fleet did not know how to use it, the yard did not 
know how to install it, and so forth. Page 240. The

07:44.814 --> 07:52.265
research and design section initiated research, 
coordinated it, and prepared specifications for

07:44.814 --> 07:52.265
all the radio types except radar. Installation 
and maintenance of radio equipment and

07:53.367 --> 08:01.359
initiation of their procurement, on the other 
hand, were handled separately for each equipment

07:53.367 --> 08:01.359
used, ship, shore, Marine Corps, and the like. The 
procurement of equipment was not consolidated.

08:11.887 --> 08:25.253
In view of the increasing radio and sound 
expansions and the even more rapid development of

08:11.887 --> 08:25.253
the electronics art, the first and perhaps the 
only fundamental reorganization, that of

08:11.887 --> 08:25.253
October 1942, made the radio branch into a 
separate bureauship's division. This has been

08:26.115 --> 08:32.207
indicated already as Code 900 under Captain 
Dowell.

08:34.870 --> 08:42.278
In mid-1944, the new organization included three 
branches, design, equipment, and installation

08:34.870 --> 08:42.278
and maintenance. The design branch, 
parenthetical, with which we are concerned,

08:43.400 --> 09:00.439
prepared design and performance 
characteristics from military characteristics

08:43.400 --> 09:00.439
laid down by ARP 25 of CNO, established 
manufacturing specifications, and initiated

08:43.400 --> 09:00.439
and coordinated design and development 
including airborne design, which has been

09:01.330 --> 09:05.656
transferred to the aircraft branch in November 
43. An interesting statement on page 248. The

09:10.724 --> 09:30.072
Bureau of Aeronautics Procurements constituted 
a very large volume, even larger than that of the

09:10.724 --> 09:30.072
Bureau of Ships, and was scattered among many of 
the same companies finishing Bureau of Ships

09:10.724 --> 09:30.072
requirements.

09:30.440 --> 09:38.228
to allow the Bureau of Aeronautics to procure 
independently would have split the Navy

09:30.440 --> 09:38.228
contracting into competing and 
administratively independent camps. Thus, the

09:39.209 --> 09:44.314
entire activity was relegated to the Bureau of 
Ships. And immediately prior to the war's end in

09:44.334 --> 09:57.688
1945, the division adopted the name, quote, 
electronics, unquote.

09:57.848 --> 09:59.029
Page 251. Electronics design, quoted in full 
because of its importance. A, design policy

10:05.398 --> 10:08.262
between World Wars I and II. One great lesson 
learned by the Navy between the World Wars was not

10:10.164 --> 10:19.135
to depend on the surpluses of one war to carry it 
through the lean appropriation period after that

10:10.164 --> 10:19.135
war. As a consequence of this philosophy, most 
appropriations flow into material items to the

10:20.097 --> 10:26.805
detriment of research and design. Following 
World War I, available funds barely permitted

10:27.730 --> 10:37.010
equipments needed to be met, so that limited use 
was made of the large commercial laboratories for

10:27.730 --> 10:37.010
developing new instruments. In retrospect, it is 
easy to see that the Navy would have fared far

10:37.812 --> 10:46.431
better with fewer but more advanced equipment 
serving as a basis for large-scale manufacturer

10:47.035 --> 10:48.959
manufacture when war proved imminent. As a 
consequence of this almost insurmountable

10:49.661 --> 11:02.428
error, it became necessary in World War II to 
concentrate design, to concentrate advancement

10:49.661 --> 11:02.428
in design, while simultaneously attempting mass 
production

11:07.066 --> 11:10.792
It is not the purpose of this history to malign or to 
slander our predecessors. Instead, we approach

11:10.972 --> 11:23.893
this particular phase of the Bureau's history 
from the standpoint expressed by one of our

11:10.972 --> 11:23.893
leading naval officers, quote, the judgment of a 
schoolboy in retrospect is better than the

11:10.972 --> 11:23.893
greatest general on the field of battle, end 
quote. In retrospect, then, let us view the facts

11:23.913 --> 11:34.170
concerning our lack of attention upon research, 
facts which now appall us, but which may permit us

11:23.913 --> 11:34.170
to gain some valuable experience. The port 
probably lay in fixing too much attention upon

11:35.180 --> 11:45.697
meeting material needs of the moment rather than 
accepting something less in order to devote more

11:35.180 --> 11:45.697
time and money to advancing research and 
development. Whatever the reasons for this near

11:46.618 --> 11:59.078
catastrophe, we must be alert to this danger, 
which will always be with us, for it is only human to

11:46.618 --> 11:59.078
prefer tangible goods to gambling on 
developments which may turn out to be

11:46.618 --> 11:59.078
unsuccessful. That the Bureau should have asked 
for more money for the specific purpose of

11:59.834 --> 12:06.264
electronic design and development is painfully 
evident now. As late as 1939, for example, the

12:07.165 --> 12:15.137
Bureau requested to receive for research and 
development the incredible small sum of $25,000.

12:15.477 --> 12:23.209
All war plans for electronics made during the 
years of peace were not only qualitatively but

12:15.477 --> 12:23.209
quantitatively inadequate. This fault was a 
common one and indicated that the general refusal

12:23.847 --> 12:34.018
of the public to think about war in realistic terms 
and with imagination was reflected in the

12:23.847 --> 12:34.018
planning of the department. The Naval Research 
Laboratory found that the suggestion of the

12:34.038 --> 12:44.409
Edison Board of World War I proved to be an 
immensely profitable venture, particularly in

12:34.038 --> 12:44.409
its development of underwater sound and radar. 
However, it never received the Navy's

12:44.989 --> 12:47.712
wholehearted support. the attitude of which 
rapidly approached that of a businessman

12:48.147 --> 12:57.542
interested chiefly in large-scale production 
and distrusting, untried theories and

12:48.147 --> 12:57.542
long-haired professors. Indeed, all research 
was stopped, and the neighbors of such laboratory

12:58.263 --> 13:05.113
almost wiped out in an economy wave in the early 
1930s. Unhappily, the same suspension of

13:05.314 --> 13:16.551
research also occurred in industry, where 
emphasis was placed on production that had

13:05.314 --> 13:16.551
already been engineered. The laboratory 
department of Westinghouse, for example, faded

13:17.105 --> 13:20.889
into oblivion. What basis do we have now for not 
believing, if peace continues for a dozen years or

13:21.550 --> 13:29.800
so, that interest in new development will not 
again subside?

13:33.804 --> 13:38.910
Page 253, paragraph B, design policy and workload 
during wartime. Despite our failure to maintain

13:39.953 --> 13:47.961
research and design in peacetime, the war years 
proved that one vital qualification of this

13:39.953 --> 13:47.961
criticism must be observed. To say that our 
complex problems of equipping the wartime fleet

13:49.182 --> 14:00.394
with modern electronic equipment stemmed wholly 
from an inadequate development program is

13:49.182 --> 14:00.394
somewhat of an oversimplification of the 
situation. This conclusion is based on the

14:01.415 --> 14:09.623
assumption that with adequately developed 
equipments as of the beginning of the war, designs

14:01.415 --> 14:09.623
could have been frozen and full emphasis devoted 
to standardization and maximum production.

14:15.143 --> 14:30.546
Actually, such an action could never have been 
fully adopted since it was a basic policy of the

14:15.143 --> 14:30.546
United States throughout the war and in all fields 
to deliberately sacrifice some measure of

14:15.143 --> 14:30.546
efficiency in production in the interest of 
constantly improving its weapons. It is

14:31.408 --> 14:36.876
interesting to note that such a philosophy was in 
direct opposition to that adopted by Germany

14:37.227 --> 14:42.233
where early standardization was established in 
an effort to squeeze out the last measure of

14:37.227 --> 14:42.233
production. Thus, even though research and 
development had been carried on during peace,

14:43.254 --> 14:54.108
efforts to improve equipment by applying the 
lessons learned in actual combat would have

14:43.254 --> 14:54.108
continued. In so doing, therefore, production 
problems would have remained relatively as

14:54.889 --> 15:02.659
complex and pressing, but our designs would have 
been more advanced. More advanced. Concerning

15:06.387 --> 15:25.465
the interrelationship between design and 
production, one job patient in the design branch

15:06.387 --> 15:25.465
before the war and in its early stages was the need 
to indoctrinate a large number of officer and

15:06.387 --> 15:25.465
civil service engineering personnel in methods 
of arriving at suitable designs and transmitting

15:06.387 --> 15:25.465
data to hundreds of contractors. Contractors had 
to be trained also, for most of them were

15:25.505 --> 15:31.171
inexperienced in meeting Navy specifications. 
They go on to discuss standardization, and the

15:36.813 --> 15:51.006
Bureau of Ships performed a particularly 
effective job in the case of tubes, cables, and

15:36.813 --> 15:51.006
connectors, although standardization in this 
field was carried out primarily at the Army Signal

15:36.813 --> 15:51.006
Standards Agency with Bureau of Ships 
assistance. On page 255, continuing,

15:51.867 --> 16:05.520
the magnitude of this design task facing the 
technical minds of the armed forces and private

15:51.867 --> 16:05.520
industry of our nation can scarcely be grasped by 
even the most interested reader. Chart 22 plots

16:06.260 --> 16:13.186
the new design developments as a function of 
calendar years from 1938 to the war's end. Roughly

16:15.068 --> 16:22.555
reading it in 1938, the number

16:15.068 --> 16:22.555
of model letters assigned were about 100. In 1940, 
it dropped to about 80. In 1941, it was back up to

16:26.239 --> 16:29.241
100. In 1942, it was about 300. In 1943, it was About 
520 in 1944,

16:34.660 --> 16:44.495
about 540 in 1946, and it dropped down again to less 
than 200.

16:47.540 --> 16:53.169
From 47 new designs in 1938, this load skyrocketed 
to 520 in 1944. Figures alone, however, present

16:53.249 --> 17:00.600
but a superficial picture of the overall 
proportions of this comprehensive program.

17:01.492 --> 17:08.620
Undisclosed is the fact that in this period entire 
new systems were designed based on principles

17:01.492 --> 17:08.620
which had scarcely been considered before the 
war. The most widely known and appealing to the

17:09.261 --> 17:13.125
public and technicians alike is radar. However, 
many others involving equal or almost equal

17:13.826 --> 17:23.918
technical problems were conceived, developed, 
tested, produced, and installed in time to play an

17:13.826 --> 17:23.918
effective part in the successful outcome of the 
war. Typical of these are Loran, IFF, television,

17:29.065 --> 17:57.165
beacons, ground control approach systems, 
automatic bearing indicator direction finders,

17:29.065 --> 17:57.165
radio and radar countermeasures, bathy 
thermographs and their tactical usage, repeat,

17:29.065 --> 17:57.165
bathy thermographs and their tactical usage, 
meteorological apparatus, cryptographic and

17:29.065 --> 17:57.165
cryptoanalytical devices, radio 
teletypewriter systems, and communications

17:29.065 --> 17:57.165
equipment in the ultra-high frequency regions. 
Concomitantly, each of these new projects

17:57.905 --> 18:09.194
required a host of attendant advances in the 
related fields of vacuum tubes, components,

17:57.905 --> 18:09.194
controls, antennas, and so forth.

18:12.918 --> 18:14.099
Page 257.

18:16.521 --> 18:19.503
Improvement in existing equipments were 
constantly being made. Fast time constant

18:19.643 --> 18:24.567
circuits were added to radars to enable them to 
track planes through land masses. Indication of

18:25.408 --> 18:27.810
bearing error in sonar equipment BDI was 
developed and incorporated in old and new models.

18:32.827 --> 18:44.218
Constant major and minor changes followed these 
typical examples, all designed to make the

18:32.827 --> 18:44.218
equipment more effective, more rugged, more 
closely representative of actual combat

18:32.827 --> 18:44.218
requirements.

18:48.923 --> 18:54.408
Now, item C, paragraph C, page 258, specific 
research programs. One, underwater sound. The

18:57.068 --> 19:03.517
underwater sound program throughout the 
interwar period proved to be the most important

18:57.068 --> 19:03.517
and involved of the Navy's research programs. 
Research and development in this field prior to

19:04.358 --> 19:13.110
the end of World War I centered in New London, 
Connecticut, but in 1919, this activity

19:04.358 --> 19:13.110
transferred to the U.S. Naval Experimental 
Station at Annapolis, Maryland. Very soon

19:16.375 --> 19:22.924
thereafter, the multi-shot microphone lines 
were developed for use with electrical

19:16.375 --> 19:22.924
direction-finding compensator. and these 
together became the generally accepted devices

19:23.242 --> 19:27.970
for detecting submerged submarines. In 
addition, the Sonic Depth Finder for

19:28.791 --> 19:33.539
navigational aid was developed at Annapolis. But 
after 1923, all this research work continued at

19:34.100 --> 19:44.558
the Naval Research Laboratory and the Navy Yard in 
Washington, as well as at the various commercial

19:34.100 --> 19:44.558
laboratories. Prior to this development, 
underwater sound detectors, hurriedly designed

19:46.630 --> 19:59.563
and manufactured mainly from design knowledge of 
telephone circuits and equipments, had proved

19:46.630 --> 19:59.563
the solution to the U-boat in many ways.

20:00.985 --> 20:13.498
However, when the enemy denoised their 
submarines to minimize the effects of such

20:00.985 --> 20:13.498
noisemakers as pumps, fans, motors, gears, 
bearing propellers, and so forth, this form of

20:00.985 --> 20:13.498
detection equipment became almost completely 
inefficient. Out of the necessity for a more

20:14.204 --> 20:19.632
adequate device, the echo ranging means were 
devised. Echo ranging devices provide merely

20:20.433 --> 20:28.205
means whereby the researching vessel transmits 
or sends out an underwater sound signal in all

20:20.433 --> 20:28.205
directions. The presence of a target within a 
reasonable distance produces a returning echo

20:28.966 --> 20:34.474
for this transmitted signal. By means of accurate 
timing and bearing determination mechanisms,

20:34.859 --> 20:45.134
this equipment is enabled not only to detect the 
presence of the target, but also to locate its

20:34.859 --> 20:45.134
position and distance and bearing. From the words 
sound, navigation, and ranging comes the word

20:45.715 --> 20:51.484
sonar for this type of equipment.

20:56.695 --> 21:09.870
Out of these detecting and direction and 
depth-finding equipments developed the

20:56.695 --> 21:09.870
standard high-frequency echo-ranging and 
sounding equipments, later known as models XL,

20:56.695 --> 21:09.870
XN, and QA, employing the quartz-steel type of 
projector. These early equipments were, until a

21:10.131 --> 21:24.407
commercial company could be interested in 
producing them, manufactured by the Navy Yard,

21:10.131 --> 21:24.407
which first produced and installed them in 1930 on 
about 20 destroyers of the latest class at that

21:10.131 --> 21:24.407
time, the 1200-ton class. Rochelle salt 
projectors were next developed for submarine use

21:24.708 --> 21:34.922
at slow speeds, while for higher speeds a resonant 
type device which could eliminate interference

21:24.708 --> 21:34.922
from background noises was introduced. With the 
acquisition of the British Streamline dome,

21:35.683 --> 21:46.058
however, the Rochelle salt type attained general 
service due to its narrow beam width and

21:35.683 --> 21:46.058
consequent better direction. Under the 
Roosevelt administration, the shipbuilding

21:46.932 --> 21:54.705
program expanded during the 1930s, and with its 
sonar development and installations increased.

21:54.745 --> 22:03.440
In 1939, only one major production source for this 
equipment existed, although it was now working

21:54.745 --> 22:03.440
overtime to keep up with demand. The Navy now had 
reliable echo-ranging and echo-sounding

22:04.141 --> 22:12.535
equipment for large ships, but its experimental 
models for small craft proved wholly inadequate.

22:13.139 --> 22:26.762
In 1941, therefore, Radio Corporation of America 
and Submarine Signal Company were given a

22:13.139 --> 22:26.762
development contract which succeeded after some 
difficulties and false starts in turning out a

22:13.139 --> 22:26.762
successful Rochelle assault set for small craft. 
While sound improvements were developed by the

22:27.523 --> 22:36.278
National Defense and Research Council, 
including ideas for better bearing

22:27.523 --> 22:36.278
determination for reducing the blast on an 
operator's ears, Most improvements were

22:36.578 --> 22:38.500
borrowed from the British. Research throughout 
the entire war continued, however, to such an

22:38.540 --> 22:47.768
extent that up to VJ Day, modifications were still 
being made to meet the changes in the war against

22:38.540 --> 22:47.768
U-boats. Submarine warfare is no exception to the 
historically proven rule that measure and

22:48.769 --> 23:00.881
countermeasure succeed each other in swift 
succession, with each new weapon more terrible

22:48.769 --> 23:00.881
than the last and each defense more difficult to 
provide in time. The U-boat developments

23:01.801 --> 23:03.463
included deeper submerged depths, tougher 
hulls, and faster submerged speeds. These made it

23:08.165 --> 23:18.836
necessary to develop means of maintaining 
contact with a deep target and determining target

23:08.165 --> 23:18.836
depth in order to improve attack accuracy.

23:19.577 --> 23:30.868
Operational experience with high-speed task 
groups also made it necessary both to give

23:19.577 --> 23:30.868
attention to underwater streamlining in order to 
reduce water noise and to improve ship search

23:19.577 --> 23:30.868
efficiency at higher speeds. VE Day found the 
Germans launching a submarine capable of

23:31.692 --> 23:43.288
completely submerged operation for periods of 
weeks or months, equipped with incredibly deep

23:31.692 --> 23:43.288
diving and with getaway speeds of 24 knots 
submerged. Our loud opinion is that it could have

23:43.328 --> 23:50.118
outdistanced and probably shaken off any of our 
escorts which might have attacked it. Thus we see

23:50.799 --> 23:56.046
the importance of sonar and the vital necessity 
for its adequate development. The extent of

23:56.667 --> 24:12.590
Allied scientific advancement in this field may 
be found in the access loss of 996 submarines in the

23:56.667 --> 24:12.590
72-month Battle of the Atlantic.

24:12.610 --> 24:26.370
On page 275, under post-war design, under the 
sonar, quote, effort is in the direction of

24:12.610 --> 24:26.370
increased range and accuracy, more positive 
target identification, and integrations of the

24:26.840 --> 24:31.026
various sonar systems for pro- and 
anti-submarine attacks. This work includes

24:31.747 --> 24:35.973
airborne sonar and research into underwater 
propagation.

24:40.981 --> 24:51.156
Continuing from the report of April 1947 of 
Captain Hull, who voted to the Chief of the Bureau,

24:40.981 --> 24:51.156
he made these comments. Captain Hull continued, 
In order to meet the electronics objective,

24:54.295 --> 25:12.747
certain fundamental works including 
propagation of electromagnetic waves,

24:54.295 --> 25:12.747
development of frequency generating and 
stabilizing devices, new electron tubes and

24:54.295 --> 25:12.747
components, various types of amplifying and 
detecting devices and associated systems

24:54.295 --> 25:12.747
requirements are being studied and evaluated. 
The electronics division has attempted to make

25:13.588 --> 25:18.717
full use of the developments consummated during 
the last war. As a result, the work of the Division

25:18.899 --> 25:25.487
has increased so that at present 60% more projects 
are being handled than at any time during the war.

25:26.409 --> 25:34.759
In this connection, the Electronics Division is 
engaged in a thorough standardization program

25:26.409 --> 25:34.759
with the Army on component design, stocking, 
cataloging, and nomenclature. The research and

25:35.941 --> 25:41.568
development work of the Division is handled by 
assigning projects to various agencies and

25:35.941 --> 25:41.568
contractors. Projects are set up directly with 
commercial organizations and laboratories.

25:46.422 --> 25:51.688
with activities such as the Bureau of Standards, 
Naval Electronics Laboratory, U.S. Naval

25:51.708 --> 25:59.017
Underwater Sound Laboratory, and through the 
Office of Naval Research for the Naval Research

25:51.708 --> 25:59.017
Laboratory at various universities. The needs of 
the service are under continual review, and new

25:59.939 --> 26:13.375
technological developments are under constant 
surveillance with the objective of having the

25:59.939 --> 26:13.375
best electronic equipment and techniques at all 
times, end quote, on page 277. One of the most

26:14.468 --> 26:26.261
difficult things for the Navy Department to do was 
to actually get the stuff that was being designed

26:14.468 --> 26:26.261
into the fleet.

26:26.281 --> 26:34.550
The history goes on, on page 278, to give a 
description of this difficulty which plagued us

26:26.281 --> 26:34.550
all at the time.

26:37.413 --> 26:41.978
Part four, the procurement program, 
requirements and allowances. Despite the rapid

26:43.544 --> 26:53.036
advances in design, a system for determining and 
reporting electronic requirements had not been

26:43.544 --> 26:53.036
developed until late 1942. The pressure of the 
task, however, caused the requirement and

26:53.096 --> 27:03.409
allowance program to be projected, a system which 
required starting with plans and procedures,

26:53.096 --> 27:03.409
data on size, Voltage, power supply, mast 
heights, strengthen the freedom from

27:04.621 --> 27:10.006
obstructions and other ship's data. No ship had 
radar equipment, for instance, or any allowance

27:10.547 --> 27:18.994
for such equipment, and until radar demonstrated 
its worth in combat, it proved difficult to

27:10.547 --> 27:18.994
interest people in it. Yet the responsibility 
dissolved upon the electronics division, the

27:19.195 --> 27:32.367
electronics division to act as technical 
consultant, technical consultant to the CNO, so

27:19.195 --> 27:32.367
that the latter could fulfill its responsibility 
for issuing procurement directives. The General

27:33.595 --> 27:39.004
Board and CNO established military 
characteristics of equipment and requirements

27:33.595 --> 27:39.004
for the ship class. The Bureau of Ships and 
Electronics Division determined which

27:39.745 --> 27:48.399
equipment met those characteristics, estimated 
how many would be needed, and then initiated and

27:39.745 --> 27:48.399
planned their procurement. If existing designs 
proved not suitable, the Bureau initiated design

27:49.260 --> 27:56.211
action to meet the specifications set forth. 
Let's do that again. If existing designs prove not

27:58.776 --> 28:06.842
suitable, the Bureau initiate action, initiate 
design action to meet the specifications set

27:58.776 --> 28:06.842
forth. Beginning in March 1942, the radar 
installation section made a thorough study of

28:07.413 --> 28:17.427
physical and electrical characteristics of 
ships and recommended to CNO a certain class of

28:07.413 --> 28:17.427
radar for each ship type. For example, medium air 
search radar was recommended for destroyers as

28:17.968 --> 28:24.477
well as fire control equipment for the main 
battery of each destroyer. The number of such

28:24.517 --> 28:26.940
equipment was determined for each ship type. 
Complete allowance and requirements were

28:27.521 --> 28:35.412
checked at the installation planners for 
technical accuracy and by the ship building

28:27.521 --> 28:35.412
division for ship stability. Allowances having 
been determined for all ships of the fleet by the

28:36.303 --> 28:45.456
summer of 1942, the Electronics Division could 
then estimate requirements for each ship afloat

28:36.303 --> 28:45.456
and under construction. Upon completion of the 
estimate of allowances and requisitions,

28:47.119 --> 28:54.870
procurements were placed for all requirements 
not already placed since the allowances were

28:47.119 --> 28:54.870
completed class by class. To effect these 
procurements, a rule was set up, not based on any

28:55.571 --> 29:00.218
experience that had not existed, that an initial 
and single-shot reserve by providing 15% for

29:01.835 --> 29:17.693
battle damage and 20% for contingencies of 
various kinds, including provision for school

29:01.835 --> 29:17.693
equipment or requests from allied nations such as 
Great Britain, Australia, Russia, France, for

29:01.835 --> 29:17.693
equipment under Lend-Lease. Long before the 
equipment could be delivered to the ships,

29:18.374 --> 29:25.041
Lend-Lease requests alone amounted to more than 
five times the original contingency factor. In an

29:25.595 --> 29:35.033
effort to correct this, the radio division in the 
winter of 1942 and 43 requested the land lease

29:25.595 --> 29:35.033
administrator for exact estimates of 
requirements, but this request was never

29:25.595 --> 29:35.033
entirely complied with. Moreover, the land lease 
administration continued to request new models

29:35.874 --> 29:44.110
just emerging into production instead of the 
original models for which quantitative

29:35.874 --> 29:44.110
production had been achieved.

29:47.920 --> 29:53.005
In the spring and fall of 1943, the determination 
of requirements was placed on an IBM basis. A

29:53.426 --> 29:56.949
centralized system was set up providing a single 
requirements card for each equipment. All ship

29:57.610 --> 30:04.417
requirements became anchored to the 
shipbuilding program, and when the date of new

29:57.610 --> 30:04.417
construction of a ship changed, the requirements 
altered automatically. Moreover, the use of IBM

30:05.118 --> 30:15.328
systems yielded a ready indication of district 
requirements permitting ships to the naval

30:05.118 --> 30:15.328
districts without need for looking up individual 
ship completion dates or location of building

30:05.118 --> 30:15.328
yards. It became obvious by the spring of 1944 that 
the coordination of requirements made it

30:16.152 --> 30:24.403
necessary to eliminate the duplication among 
claimant sections for control of equipment

30:16.152 --> 30:24.403
types. For example, separate radar requirements 
for establishment and procurement were made by

30:25.204 --> 30:32.394
each of the Marine Corps ship shore sections and 
installation and maintenance branch. This

30:32.414 --> 30:40.405
conclusion led to the organization of the 
equipment branch in July and September of 1944

30:32.414 --> 30:40.405
from parts of the installation and maintenance 
branch and procurement and production branch. As

30:40.958 --> 30:47.888
already described in the organization section, 
the equipment branch was responsible for

30:40.958 --> 30:47.888
determining what and how much should be procured 
from whom. Under the terms of this

30:48.549 --> 30:56.420
reorganization, all persons concerned with 
determining requirements and distributing a

30:48.549 --> 30:56.420
certain class of equipment were placed in one 
section. Change tape to side three. Change tape to

30:58.924 --> 31:00.306
side three.

31:03.450 --> 31:06.595
And then continue on this equipment section. 
change tape to side three and continue on this

31:08.667 --> 31:12.687
equipment section.
