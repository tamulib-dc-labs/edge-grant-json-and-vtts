WEBVTT

00:04.013 --> 00:29.447
times and then other times we'd get a room in the sea and and have everybody in the committee and made sure that everybody had a chance to ask questions and I thought it was the coolest there are two things that happened that first semester that were just absolutely phenomenal and it actually started the summer before I got to go up we had a tradition at that time that we took some committee funds and I went up to DC

00:30.170 --> 00:33.934
and went to Tiger Teague's office to meet some guy named Chet Edwards.

00:35.276 --> 00:37.419
And this was in 75 still.

00:38.400 --> 00:41.043
And Chet set me up some appointments.

00:42.004 --> 00:43.826
And another guy, another Aggie named John Howard.

00:44.787 --> 00:49.233
And they got me introduced to another guy named Steve Pringle who was on PUG staff.

00:49.253 --> 00:56.802
And so I got to move around the Capitol, but the most important one was the year before we had Barry Goldwater Jr.

00:56.822 --> 00:59.485
as a speaker, when I was major committee chairman,

00:59.718 --> 01:04.948
our major event chairman, and it fascinated me that Barry Goldwater, Jr.

01:04.988 --> 01:12.823
would step out of a hearing and visit with me for 30 minutes in the hall.

01:13.324 --> 01:21.760
We sat down and just talked, and then he pointed me to several people that I went to that ultimately got on our speakers list.

01:22.432 --> 01:24.296
So those were the really cool ones.

01:24.356 --> 01:29.265
The other one was the green couch of Wayne Stark, but it wasn't in his office.

01:29.325 --> 01:30.868
It was at the MSA Hotel desk.

01:30.888 --> 01:36.258
We talked about this, which is Wayne walking up behind me, blessed started.

01:36.399 --> 01:43.512
At that time, Mr. Stark walking up behind me and in his booming voice going, you did what?

01:44.268 --> 01:50.094
And the long and short of it, obviously, we had invited Bella Absu to be a speaker.

01:50.955 --> 01:57.582
And he thought Tiger Tig would have a conniption fit, and Tiger probably would have.

01:59.264 --> 02:01.346
And I went back and looked at this.

02:01.927 --> 02:09.094
Our replacement for Bella was some economics professor that I was pressured into to bring to talk about energy at that time.

02:09.530 --> 02:14.940
About what was the fee that these big-name politicians got then?

02:15.080 --> 02:18.126
That was the cool thing about PF.

02:18.146 --> 02:19.428
We were in a race.

02:19.468 --> 02:20.390
It was a competition.

02:20.410 --> 02:22.754
All the other student unions used fees.

02:23.515 --> 02:24.397
We didn't.

02:24.417 --> 02:29.145
Our budget, and I've got the record still in the house, was $14,000 for the year.

02:30.007 --> 02:33.934
We paid their expenses, and that was it.

02:33.914 --> 02:39.443
Tiger Teague and Chet and Pogue and some of the, and a lot of Jack Williams.

02:39.483 --> 02:47.075
When we brought Bob Stouse down here and I went to visit with Dr. Williams, the very first thing he said is, we've got to have a reception over in the house.

02:47.095 --> 02:47.977
Would you like to do that?

02:48.297 --> 02:49.359
Absolutely.

02:50.160 --> 02:51.542
Incredible opportunity.

02:52.384 --> 02:56.310
And so we had a chance to bring in people from across the community, but

02:56.797 --> 03:01.265
We didn't pay, and this was a point of contention against us versus Great Issues.

03:01.285 --> 03:03.208
Great Issues was twice our budget.

03:03.288 --> 03:07.355
They paid fees and we didn't, and we got in as top flight talent.

03:08.517 --> 03:13.746
Do you have any favorite recollections of some of the experiences with some of these celebrities?

03:14.508 --> 03:15.970
Two.

03:16.591 --> 03:18.914
And both ends of the extreme.

03:19.696 --> 03:20.276
Actually, three.

03:20.357 --> 03:28.729
I had a really interesting, assertive, some would say combative discussion with Howard Phillips at Shirley Black's house.

03:29.811 --> 03:30.332
Remember Shirley?

03:32.034 --> 03:35.359
And so she was a faculty advisor for political forum at that time.

03:35.399 --> 03:36.601
She was in history.

03:36.781 --> 03:37.723
Yeah.

03:38.063 --> 03:40.627
And I had a very combative experience.

03:40.647 --> 03:41.889
Kathy and I both with Howard.

03:41.909 --> 03:42.750
That didn't get along well.

03:43.321 --> 03:54.450
But the one that I remember the most was sitting, or two of them, was sitting in the dining area over the MSC for like three hours drinking coffee with Frank Mankiewicz and learning how the Kennedys ran campaigns.

03:55.752 --> 03:57.613
I wanted to get into politics by that time.

03:58.654 --> 04:02.197
I was trying to get into the graduate program of political science here.

04:03.618 --> 04:12.906
I was just thrilled with what politics could be, and I wanted to get in on campaigns and do the advance and the events set up, because that's all the MSC was.

04:13.392 --> 04:24.009
And so to sit there and just listen about the Kennedy stories, both Bobby and John and how they ran the campaigns and Larry O'Brien and all this other stuff, I mean, I remember that to this day.

04:24.309 --> 04:27.214
Did Mankiewicz share any details that you now think?

04:27.234 --> 04:27.915
Not that I don't.

04:27.935 --> 04:28.876
I mean, I don't remember.

04:28.936 --> 04:29.377
We talked.

04:29.497 --> 04:30.118
We talked.

04:30.436 --> 04:36.986
mundane stuff about what it was like to go in and organize little areas.

04:37.006 --> 04:44.257
Did he indicate any hint of anything where they might have stuffed a ballot box or nothing like that?

04:44.938 --> 04:46.420
None there.

04:46.981 --> 04:48.883
That was to happen in the future, but not there.

04:49.965 --> 04:52.409
But it was good.

04:52.609 --> 04:53.971
Bob Strauss was the extreme.

04:54.091 --> 04:58.097
Bob Strauss was the quite dictified chairman of the Democratic Party.

04:58.651 --> 05:06.098
you know, the paramount of statesmen coming to A&M.

05:06.798 --> 05:13.504
And Dr. Williams and Wayne and others just made that an incredible three-day event.

05:13.825 --> 05:16.047
And I mean, we had him down here, we showed him a rant.

05:17.308 --> 05:22.913
He took time to treat, again, students as individuals where you could talk to him.

05:24.114 --> 05:27.797
The reception was incredible over at Dr. Williams' house.

05:28.385 --> 05:36.973
I do remember standing by in that front foyer introducing Ambassador Strauss to everybody in there.

05:36.994 --> 05:38.715
I mean, that was just an absolute thrill.

05:38.875 --> 05:44.901
It was also scary because I was starting to get my confidence up by this time.

05:45.502 --> 05:46.903
When you work around Wayne, you have to.

05:48.425 --> 05:52.889
But that first time I walked into Dr. Williams' office, I mean, I had a frog in my throat.

05:53.009 --> 05:54.451
I had butterflies in my stomach.

05:54.591 --> 05:55.692
I know I was sweating.

05:56.347 --> 06:16.175
and he was about as sociable and put me at ease as quickly as one could, and offered ideas so I didn't have to ask, and all the ideas were the right ones that we were thinking about, but I didn't have the courage to really say, could we do this too?

06:17.076 --> 06:20.521
It set my whole life in a new direction.

06:21.182 --> 06:26.269
What did you and the general student body think of Dr. Williams?

06:28.274 --> 06:30.818
I'm probably a little different than the general student body.

06:30.838 --> 06:34.685
I mean, he came to the MSC.

06:34.805 --> 06:40.736
You know, we did the old big induction banquet at that time for the incoming and outgoing councils and director.

06:40.756 --> 06:44.001
And he came to the one as my incoming president and the one as the outgoing.

06:44.041 --> 06:48.409
And I got books from him both times, so I'm real spoiled on Dr. Williams.

06:49.047 --> 06:54.872
he was the best thing that happened to me, or one of the best things that happened to me and Kathy.

06:55.613 --> 07:03.541
He and John Koldis never started a conversation without asking about Kathy.

07:04.161 --> 07:11.268
And the year I was present, we were already married, so that was kind of an anomaly, and we were grad students, and that was another anomaly.

07:13.109 --> 07:17.974
But he always asked, and what was interesting is, I was in John Koldis's, we'd go to

07:18.477 --> 07:25.611
dinner once a week club as well with the court commander and RHA president, student body president, that kind of stuff.

07:26.272 --> 07:29.298
And John would always ask how Kathy was, and it was really funny.

07:29.939 --> 07:38.376
After we met last Thursday, I'm up on Malin's floor, and John comes out of an office, and the very first thing he says is, how's Kathy?

07:38.930 --> 07:40.594
And we haven't seen each other in years.

07:40.755 --> 07:43.943
And I'm sitting there going, golly, if I could have a memory like that.

07:44.003 --> 07:48.656
So it was really working with those individuals back then.

07:49.177 --> 07:50.661
It was Wayne.

07:50.962 --> 07:53.885
It was all the different advisors that we had in the MSC.

07:54.486 --> 08:04.919
I did a senior studies course under Dr. Stone in management about management techniques that actually led to a re-evaluation of how we did business in the MSC.

08:05.680 --> 08:17.053
There were some really good things happening at that time, not because of the position, but because of the excitement of how A&M was starting to change.

08:17.422 --> 08:21.929
If there was anything that the student body would have, it probably saw a lot of that change taking place.

08:22.390 --> 08:23.612
There was also the differences.

08:23.692 --> 08:27.558
I mean, the wall going up around was a big deal in the student senate firm.

08:27.659 --> 08:30.924
Remember when they started to put up the wall around the campus?

08:31.785 --> 08:34.329
And so there was the bat stories and stuff like that.

08:34.390 --> 08:41.000
We had pink flamingos we had to argue about and Rocky Horror Picture Show and those kind of things.

08:41.782 --> 08:43.885
What was the argument against the wall?

08:45.552 --> 08:48.095
that we were keeping students.

08:48.535 --> 08:49.296
It was never clear.

08:49.356 --> 08:53.661
I mean, it was obviously very porous whether we were keeping students in or keeping people out.

08:55.363 --> 08:56.465
Or was it a waste of money?

08:58.007 --> 09:01.410
Did the students really call him a smiling Jack Williams?

09:01.531 --> 09:01.971
Absolutely.

09:05.655 --> 09:12.924
But it didn't have the negative connotation in some circles that it might have been others.

09:12.984 --> 09:13.905
I mean, in our career,

09:14.375 --> 09:33.139
There was actually, it was always Dr. Williams, and if there was something happening that we didn't really like, it would be Ismail and Jack, but it was mainly, he was the student leadership that I worked with at that time, and was a part of, he and Coltis particularly, I mean, it was, it was, I aspired to be the best.

09:33.239 --> 09:35.602
What was their relationship, as far as you know?

09:36.183 --> 09:38.366
You know, we don't see what goes on behind the scenes.

09:39.267 --> 09:43.032
We thought we did, but we didn't, and I can't tell you,

09:43.315 --> 09:44.398
what actually happened.

09:44.418 --> 09:46.664
We always thought they actually got along well.

09:46.805 --> 09:48.189
Oh, they did.

09:48.209 --> 09:48.911
Superbably.

09:48.991 --> 09:50.956
And so we didn't know anything different than that.

09:51.016 --> 09:53.764
We always knew that Wayne was a waste of trouble.

09:54.352 --> 09:57.436
We always let us know he was in trouble, which was kind of funny too.

09:58.977 --> 10:04.664
And there was the Wayne and Doc Adair fight at that time, because she was starting up student activities and student government.

10:04.964 --> 10:08.508
We gave student government a couple of auspices in the student programs office.

10:08.548 --> 10:09.910
We had all those battles going.

10:10.351 --> 10:18.520
There was Fred McClure typing 200 plus words a minute, if not 255 on an electronic typewriter at night, which just amazed everybody.

10:18.820 --> 10:23.626
I never saw Fred join his class, but you sure heard him typing reports at night up there.

10:24.267 --> 10:27.512
All right, let's make believe that I didn't know this man, Fred McClure.

10:28.293 --> 10:29.995
Tell me about him as an Aggie.

10:30.736 --> 10:48.760
Fred's probably one of the most thoughtful, articulate, focused, driven's not the right term, but he has the energy to achieve things.

10:49.381 --> 10:55.327
and be absolutely down to earth, back slapping person I've ever met.

10:56.148 --> 10:59.512
He was student body president, so he sat on the MSC Council.

10:59.752 --> 11:01.094
Were y'all classmates?

11:01.114 --> 11:04.477
No, because I was a grad student then, and he was 77.

11:04.838 --> 11:06.239
He's one behind you.

11:06.259 --> 11:07.981
But we were contemporaries.

11:08.341 --> 11:14.748
He was student body president, and Rob Harvey was corps commander, and they were on the MSC Council for those positions.

11:15.489 --> 11:17.211
I was speaker pro tem,

11:17.697 --> 11:27.187
So I was in the Senate and we had, Fred had, the city government had an office up in the SPS, so we got to see him quite a bit up there.

11:27.688 --> 11:36.657
Fred was one of those guys that you knew he was gonna achieve things and you kinda wanna figure out a way to watch him grow.

11:36.717 --> 11:41.022
I can remember one of the summers I was up there was the summer he interned for Ford.

11:41.525 --> 11:51.440
And so he was in the old EOB and to go into the old executive office building and see this just great big old office you're going, all right, Fred's got to be set where he's going.

11:52.001 --> 11:53.603
But he was bright and articulate.

11:54.004 --> 11:57.509
You had to be organized to go after him.

11:58.150 --> 12:00.293
And the only reason we packed the,

12:00.610 --> 12:10.764
the Student Senate with MSC people, we took a page from the Corps, was so that when we were arguing student services, we had votes in there, and we didn't have to work overly hard.

12:10.784 --> 12:11.946
We got burned the year before.

12:13.528 --> 12:18.596
But we got engaged in a lot of parliamentary pieces with Fred, and it was challenging.

12:18.656 --> 12:19.417
It was really fun.

12:20.218 --> 12:28.710
And it was funny because when I finished up as president of the MSC, and I was still working on my graduate work, I was elected speaker.

12:28.960 --> 12:32.045
So I was going to have to follow in Fred's footsteps twice removed.

12:32.770 --> 12:34.363
And Rob Harvey was going to be president.

12:34.647 --> 12:41.535
And so that was gonna set up to be an interesting deal and then I ended up going and Chet decided to run that summer, but.

12:42.135 --> 12:47.181
Now Fred, do you remember when you first saw him or anything?

12:47.361 --> 12:52.286
Yeah, it was during the political forum times because he was FFA national president at that time.

12:53.047 --> 12:57.452
But it was during the student senate stuff that really that year I was MSC president.

12:57.932 --> 13:02.157
We were always, he would make most of Coles' weekly dinners.

13:02.137 --> 13:03.779
We got to know each other quite well.

13:03.919 --> 13:09.004
And the fact that he, black, never entered in?

13:09.024 --> 13:13.108
Of course, we were the token Democrats, too, on this campus at that time.

13:13.128 --> 13:14.990
Kathy and we were both active in Young Democrats.

13:15.030 --> 13:17.572
Of course, Fred's active in Young Republicans.

13:17.652 --> 13:19.894
So we had good things to talk about when we got together.

13:20.455 --> 13:30.625
But he always, it was funny, Kathy was always, shouldn't have been, but was always in the, not really in the shadow, that's not the right term,

13:30.892 --> 13:34.618
She's very quiet and Fred would go to great extremes.

13:34.818 --> 13:39.966
A couple others as well, but mainly Fred, to really make her feel on top of the world when she was in the group.

13:40.487 --> 13:42.150
So that's just the kind of person.

13:42.170 --> 13:44.533
So his skin color didn't have anything to do with it.

13:44.734 --> 13:46.536
Smart as a whip, absolutely.

13:46.977 --> 13:47.838
Sharp as a tack.

13:48.259 --> 13:49.381
A neat guy.

13:49.401 --> 13:50.382
And a splendid singer.

13:51.584 --> 13:53.467
Actually, much more so than that.

13:53.567 --> 13:58.435
I mean, he could have had a choice of multiple different things that he's wanted to do in life.

13:58.668 --> 14:03.419
But not many people know, and I think he was typing two to 250 words a minute.

14:03.439 --> 14:10.015
I mean, listening to him on that IBM Selectric up there typing, because we could stay in the SPO until late, late, late.

14:10.095 --> 14:11.158
So we always did.

14:11.493 --> 14:12.735
MSC would lock up.

14:12.755 --> 14:14.959
We had keys to the SBO and the MSC.

14:15.439 --> 14:20.668
The student programs office, which the government office was up on one side and I was on the other side.

14:20.828 --> 14:22.691
Both Fred and I had offices.

14:23.532 --> 14:27.499
And that's where we did studies and that's where we talked through stuff and everything else.

14:27.519 --> 14:30.103
So he was up there a lot as late at night as we were.

14:30.704 --> 14:32.186
And there was a group of about five of us.

14:32.447 --> 14:37.635
Did he ever, as you recall, talk about his goals, what he was hoping to do later?

14:38.037 --> 14:39.399
No, but that was the thing about Fred.

14:39.419 --> 14:41.943
You always knew when he was going to end up in politics somewhere.

14:41.983 --> 14:48.212
The summer he came back and he'd managed Gerald Ford's youth campaign and convention, he was on top of the world.

14:48.232 --> 14:49.574
So he knew exactly where he was going to go.

14:49.594 --> 14:54.060
And, of course, we were doing stuff at the state convention for Calvin Guest at that time.

14:54.341 --> 15:02.813
And so not near on the national scene, but you could really see that he was going places and you knew that he would play a major role.

15:03.316 --> 15:07.722
All right, now one of the key female student leaders that time was Barb Sears.

15:08.443 --> 15:10.205
Barb actually was a little bit ahead of us, yes.

15:10.926 --> 15:18.997
Yeah, she was 74, so she was about two years ahead of Fred and our crew when we came in.

15:19.137 --> 15:20.198
Wasn't she the first?

15:20.719 --> 15:22.822
First woman, yes.

15:23.042 --> 15:23.242
Right.

15:23.583 --> 15:32.715
See, now she was the one that people that I learned under, Jane Nelson and Bill Davis and John Nelson,

15:33.185 --> 15:37.411
She was their contemporary, or Don Webb.

15:37.731 --> 15:45.883
And so there were a lot of times I remember Don lived in our dorm in the Corps, and so Don and Barb were very active in those kind of things.

15:45.983 --> 15:48.266
But that was just as I was starting to break in.

15:48.286 --> 15:49.448
So I was a real new kid.

15:49.768 --> 15:51.891
That just moved real fast once I got in.

15:53.453 --> 15:56.998
This is an editorial note to the typist.

15:58.598 --> 16:11.164
As I recall, when Barbara Sears, from Columbia, Missouri, ran for student body secretary, the voting booths were then in the Cushing Library.

16:12.407 --> 16:16.455
And that she, on the day of the election, put on a very pretty dress,

16:17.397 --> 16:24.334
gave her hair and her makeup particular care, especially her eyes, because she had very striking eyes.

16:25.056 --> 16:31.291
She then had some little small business-sized cards printed with her name on it and secretary.

16:32.073 --> 16:33.938
She stood on the steps.

16:34.492 --> 16:53.800
and as each prospective voter, most of which were male of course, would go up the steps, she would smile at them, blink her eyes two or three times, and then softly say, my name is Barbara Sears, I hope you'll vote for me.

16:54.050 --> 16:57.754
And she won, she won.

16:58.015 --> 17:04.182
Her father, by the way, was a truly world, world, world-class plant geneticist.

17:04.322 --> 17:04.983
No kidding.

17:06.225 --> 17:11.010
All the plant science facilities up there are named in his honor.

17:11.551 --> 17:16.997
He increased the world's production of wheat probably by 20% with his research.

17:17.017 --> 17:17.458
No kidding.

17:17.438 --> 17:19.200
A truly, truly great name.

17:19.221 --> 17:20.142
Well, she was a legend.

17:20.162 --> 17:24.828
You've got to remember, the MSC and student government were fighting at that time over student government fees.

17:24.848 --> 17:34.422
So there were some things we were in great shape on, and some things we were, I mean, it was, the battle lines, the students were mirroring the staff battle lines.

17:34.863 --> 17:38.428
You had Wayne and Carolyn, and the students were no different.

17:38.448 --> 17:41.852
Now, what was neat is we figured out how to make it all work together.

17:42.654 --> 17:47.260
Louie would have a lot more, because he was class president our senior year, junior year, and I think even our sophomore year.

17:47.999 --> 17:50.263
I don't think you made it off weird as I have.

17:50.283 --> 17:55.752
But yeah, Barb was about two years ahead of us.

17:56.493 --> 17:56.834
Let's see.

17:56.874 --> 18:02.122
Now, how did you mix all of these extracurricular activities and your major?

18:04.506 --> 18:05.428
Two things happened.

18:05.448 --> 18:12.960
You know, when I get energized by something, coursework or otherwise, things gel, I still struggle with German as a language.

18:13.345 --> 18:19.917
But I did, I think if we tallied up all my grades in Anthro, I had like a 3-5 or something like that.

18:19.937 --> 18:26.329
And when I did graduate work, I had good grades in there until I decided it was time to go play politics.

18:26.430 --> 18:29.315
And so I kind of lapsed that last summer.

18:30.036 --> 18:33.042
But I had good grades in grad school.

18:33.325 --> 18:35.048
is because I enjoyed the subject.

18:35.108 --> 18:40.618
I mean, the subjects I was taking in poli-sci at that time were how to run campaigns and things of that nature.

18:40.678 --> 18:42.341
So I just totally enjoyed it.

18:42.362 --> 18:45.668
Your junior and senior years, you're still in the Corps.

18:45.788 --> 18:47.431
Right.

18:47.571 --> 18:51.679
What was a typical day's routine for you then?

18:51.699 --> 18:52.520
Hadn't changed.

18:52.680 --> 18:54.484
The junior, senior was different.

18:54.504 --> 18:57.409
But junior had not changed at all from a freshman.

18:57.625 --> 18:59.827
As a junior, we had sophomore rooms.

18:59.927 --> 19:06.694
That means that it was just like a freshman in D2 except that we had only a small carpet in front of the bed to make it easy when we got down.

19:06.794 --> 19:08.275
But you're studying hard.

19:08.535 --> 19:11.258
Studying much harder, making the grades.

19:11.278 --> 19:11.778
Few of us.

19:12.099 --> 19:13.200
In your room or where?

19:13.660 --> 19:14.001
Library.

19:14.501 --> 19:15.302
In the library.

19:15.462 --> 19:20.487
And there were four of us left in the outfit at that time because Louie and Bill Chancey had already gone to staff.

19:21.808 --> 19:24.511
So four juniors in a large outfit.

19:24.531 --> 19:26.012
We won more that year too.

19:26.127 --> 19:27.328
That was our third year.

19:27.428 --> 19:31.212
Where in Cushing Library was your little... It wasn't Cushing.

19:31.232 --> 19:34.074
It was over here in Evans.

19:34.094 --> 19:35.115
Oh, the edition.

19:35.135 --> 19:35.355
Yeah.

19:35.375 --> 19:36.076
First edition.

19:36.116 --> 19:39.839
Yeah, so I'd just find a crack someplace where nobody was.

19:40.280 --> 19:46.906
I started in the MSC, but it was too easy to get plugged into the thing, too many other distractions in the sea.

19:47.286 --> 19:48.487
So I would find that.

19:48.767 --> 19:50.048
But it was really the subject.

19:50.088 --> 19:54.092
I mean, I was a work-study student during that time frame, so I was in anthropology.

19:54.342 --> 19:59.509
junior and senior as a work study student, working that 20 hours a week, and it was outstanding.

19:59.949 --> 20:09.081
And then I started to take, took one of Bruce Robeck's courses on Congress, and so it was just like playing to do the Senate, and so we were doing those kind of things.

20:09.121 --> 20:10.763
So those were fun courses.

20:10.844 --> 20:15.249
All right, during those undergraduate years, who paid the bills for you, Mom and Dad?

20:16.931 --> 20:18.734
We actually, they took out a student loan.

20:18.814 --> 20:20.216
I ended up paying off the student loan.

20:20.236 --> 20:21.177
That was the deal with them.

20:21.562 --> 20:27.751
When Kathy and I got married, she still had a year on her National Merit Scholarship, and so that paid our first year.

20:28.211 --> 20:33.078
We both worked summers, we both worked our way 20 hours a week during school.

20:33.919 --> 20:34.820
Still had the bug?

20:35.662 --> 20:38.205
Had the bug, what was left of it at that time.

20:38.866 --> 20:43.232
Lived in a little bitty duplex right over here behind Albertsons.

20:43.516 --> 20:45.281
What did it cost, remember?

20:45.622 --> 20:46.725
Yeah, $65 a month.

20:48.189 --> 20:52.361
And it was, I mean, we went to great lengths to make it look cool and all that kind of stuff.

20:52.381 --> 20:54.608
But, I mean, the air conditioner didn't work one summer.

20:54.708 --> 20:57.897
And, I mean, it was, we had our challenges.

20:58.332 --> 21:10.764
We like to joke, and it's been funny, because now I keep all of our books for our business and everything, so we haven't bounced checks in eons, but we like to think that we built the bank of A&M through our non-sufficient fund checks.

21:13.046 --> 21:21.014
It was tough, because parents would have liked to have done things, but Kathy's parents didn't agree with her coming to A&M.

21:22.015 --> 21:26.820
Her dad was, they probably wouldn't say that now, but her dad,

21:27.172 --> 21:35.382
was an engineer who had to quit school because his parents couldn't, or he couldn't afford it, strapped in the Army and went to Alaska.

21:36.424 --> 21:37.525
So he didn't like the military.

21:37.745 --> 21:40.569
He didn't like, I think Kathy actually came here to spite him.

21:41.570 --> 21:53.145
And we never, you know, it's always been the two of us and while family has been important, particularly in later years,

21:53.446 --> 21:55.049
It was the two of us doing stuff.

21:55.069 --> 21:57.813
I mean, she was selling, trying to sell Kirby vacuum cleaners.

21:58.134 --> 22:01.500
All right, now in the summer before you got married, you're working on the summers.

22:01.760 --> 22:03.663
Are you saving some of that money for school?

22:04.264 --> 22:05.026
We're trying to.

22:05.266 --> 22:08.772
I mean, literally, Kathy's National Merit Scholarship is what got us through.

22:09.055 --> 22:15.324
because we could live on that, and then I had a small scholarship from the former students the year I was MSC president.

22:15.944 --> 22:17.787
There were some other little things that came in there.

22:18.368 --> 22:21.732
We put as much aside as we could, but it was interesting.

22:22.093 --> 22:25.197
And through all this, to whom did you turn for advice and counsel?

22:26.920 --> 22:28.682
A lot to each other.

22:28.742 --> 22:31.466
We were good friends before we started dating, and that helped.

22:31.486 --> 22:32.287
A lot to Wayne.

22:34.790 --> 22:36.733
Remember any of the advice he gave you?

22:37.287 --> 22:39.811
Yeah, actually it wasn't advice.

22:39.851 --> 22:45.100
It was getting up the courage to ask him if I could actually compete for MSC president.

22:45.881 --> 22:53.213
Because Carolyn Johnson, CJ, bright, sharp lady, ended up becoming an attorney, 3-0.

22:55.457 --> 22:59.524
Really, I had the inside shot, I thought, at getting MSC president.

22:59.544 --> 23:00.125
What did he say?

23:00.666 --> 23:02.048
What advice did he give you?

23:02.068 --> 23:03.210
And so we talked a lot about

23:03.511 --> 23:15.307
where I wanted to go in the future, and if I didn't have the confidence to step up to the plate now, then that might be telling me something, and so that was kind of, okay, you throw it out, and I'll step up to the plate.

23:16.088 --> 23:27.624
And I wasn't sure whether, I mean, my grades were acceptable at that time, but they weren't good enough to get who's who.

23:27.644 --> 23:29.447
It's been interesting because there's been a change.

23:29.527 --> 23:31.189
Things that I couldn't get here

23:31.658 --> 23:33.560
like the RVs in some cases.

23:34.041 --> 23:38.207
But Who's Who in America really bothered me when I saw a lot of my peers up there.

23:38.247 --> 23:40.309
I knew I was everybody as smart as him.

23:40.329 --> 23:41.311
I just didn't have the GPs.

23:42.252 --> 23:49.962
So it was kind of a nice stepping threshold once I got into Marquis Who's Who in America and did those kind of pieces.

23:50.022 --> 23:51.945
So they came later in life.

23:51.965 --> 23:54.868
I just had to get refocused and regoing.

23:55.309 --> 23:58.814
Jack Williams, actually, there were a couple of times that I actually talked to him.

23:58.874 --> 24:01.497
So it was more inspirational than anything else.

24:01.848 --> 24:12.841
Jack was real good about, like John Colas was, about telling me how much better I married because of Kathy.

24:13.882 --> 24:15.625
And she was really a good anchor.

24:16.486 --> 24:23.955
Kathy wasn't the outgoing person, but she really brought a lot of stability and intestinal fortitude to do things.

24:24.635 --> 24:28.480
Other days I'd probably get real distracted and go off and do something else because it was easier.

24:29.000 --> 24:36.111
And so he was really inspirational in talking about us as a couple because we were really different than others at that stage.

24:36.151 --> 24:38.254
We were already married doing these kinds of things.

24:39.175 --> 24:44.764
And while that was of value, he continued after that to take an interest.

24:44.804 --> 24:50.252
I mean, I can still remember going down to the Texas Medical Library and having a couple of lunches with him there.

24:50.312 --> 24:54.639
And he would treat you just as if you were a peer.

24:54.699 --> 24:56.762
And that was very unusual.

24:57.265 --> 25:02.611
And he always made a point whenever we were around him, how he introduced people.

25:02.652 --> 25:11.482
So he was a role model in a lot of ways that I tried to, you know, if I ever got into positions where I was more than an executive rank, I wanted to emulate those.

25:12.283 --> 25:16.668
John Nicholas, on the other hand, was the kind of person that, yes, you could talk a lot of things about.

25:16.989 --> 25:22.055
And so he would be one that I would turn to.

25:22.175 --> 25:25.399
And then there was a lot of peer stuff.

25:26.105 --> 25:30.150
The only one that we really talked a lot about pure things, though, would have been Fred.

25:30.951 --> 25:34.135
And so that was kind of interesting.

25:34.815 --> 25:36.017
Let me turn this up.

25:36.077 --> 25:37.439
You were talking about mentor.

25:37.879 --> 25:42.244
I'll tell you who the real mentor was, and I really, I've known this, and I just didn't talk about it.

25:42.264 --> 25:43.726
Remember Howe Gangs?

25:44.067 --> 25:44.387
Sure.

25:45.028 --> 25:45.448
Howe.

25:45.468 --> 25:50.655
We played golf virtually three or four times a month.

25:50.675 --> 25:51.015
Mm-hmm.

25:51.653 --> 25:56.664
the two years that I, the MS, the PF chairman year and the president year.

25:56.704 --> 25:57.887
Now what was his?

25:57.907 --> 26:00.433
He was number two to Wayne at that stage.

26:00.493 --> 26:07.990
And so he was the, kind of the surrogate father I really didn't have here.

26:08.992 --> 26:10.135
And that's, I mean,

26:10.334 --> 26:12.177
with how you could talk about things.

26:12.898 --> 26:17.065
We did it over golf and we played religiously every weekend there.

26:17.085 --> 26:30.467
Before John Nelson left it was John and Joe Marcello and Hal and I and maybe one other and then after John left it was Joe Marcello and I and Joe was another one that would be a peer support person.

26:31.048 --> 26:36.257
Joe was grad student president at that time and he was my

26:36.558 --> 26:38.240
Council, my consigliore.

26:40.042 --> 26:48.812
Describe as much as you can this campaign for Congress that you worked on for a young man named Ted Edwards.

26:48.832 --> 26:50.013
I can give you a 30-second soundbite.

26:50.434 --> 26:53.117
It's not in the books that Arnie taught me it was supposed to be in.

26:53.778 --> 27:01.266
Arnie Bedlitz, bless his heart, was great at talking about $500,000 million campaigns, and Phil Grahams probably was.

27:01.533 --> 27:09.785
Ours was $48,000, and Chet put $20,000 in of his own money for that media buy two weeks out.

27:10.666 --> 27:11.968
I had great ideas.

27:12.048 --> 27:12.969
I mean, it was so funny.

27:13.009 --> 27:14.932
Chet, he always plays things.

27:15.292 --> 27:18.216
How did you even get involved in the first place?

27:19.158 --> 27:20.740
MSA volunteers.

27:21.461 --> 27:22.462
That's the short answer.

27:22.683 --> 27:26.528
I go up the summer before PF chair.

27:26.812 --> 27:28.413
And Chet set some stuff up.

27:28.434 --> 27:31.156
I talked about wanting to get in politics.

27:31.657 --> 27:34.139
I got active in Tiger's 76 campaign.

27:34.179 --> 27:35.200
Chet was the chair there.

27:35.620 --> 27:37.342
Was very active in Young Democrats.

27:37.402 --> 27:43.327
Got to do some stuff with Calvin Guest at the state events, which was really cool stuff.

27:43.568 --> 27:47.271
Kept pestering Chet about if he ever runs for something I want to run, help him.

27:49.633 --> 27:54.658
I mean, I was coming up with, I was taking Artie's core,

27:55.027 --> 27:58.770
coursework trying to convert it into a campaign plan for Chet.

27:59.351 --> 28:07.057
And bless Chet's hearts, he didn't say no, but I mean, I had how we would organize things on campus and how I could extrapolate it out.

28:08.678 --> 28:15.564
Chet was looking for somebody that, I mean, I don't know, it'd be interesting to find out sometime what he was looking for.

28:16.185 --> 28:22.850
But he and Marvin Collins, who is a strategist, who actually worked for Bush Sr.

28:22.930 --> 28:24.932
for a while,

28:25.975 --> 28:33.022
And Kathy and I come up, and we did a two-hour lunch up in Corsa Canada, Holiday Inn.

28:34.203 --> 28:37.266
And all leading up to, would you like to work for Chet?

28:37.326 --> 28:37.606
Yes.

28:39.007 --> 28:39.648
What's it pay?

28:39.668 --> 28:41.970
$300 a month.

28:41.990 --> 28:47.715
This is about how long before the... This would have been July of 77.

28:48.116 --> 28:55.763
And so I basically started thinking about all this and going full-time and starting to play on it.

28:56.165 --> 28:59.490
In August, we moved up here, moved up to Dallas in August.

28:59.510 --> 29:03.376
Kathy got a job through her Kellehert Southwest Airlines.

29:04.157 --> 29:07.562
And so she paid for the family, and I went to work for Chad.

29:08.003 --> 29:13.851
And we put 100-plus thousand miles on the van and on his car.

29:14.692 --> 29:16.215
We started off with nothing.

29:16.275 --> 29:19.199
We did 78 cities in two weeks.

29:19.700 --> 29:21.122
We did a 78 city in two weeks.

29:21.322 --> 29:23.826
Describe geographically the district.

29:24.143 --> 29:25.785
District was 11 counties.

29:26.406 --> 29:29.169
Southern Inn was the end of Brazos County.

29:29.189 --> 29:36.719
We went up to part of Dallas County and over west of Fort Worth and all points in between.

29:36.979 --> 29:44.189
And it was... Among the candidates was a weather... There were six candidates in the primary.

29:44.889 --> 29:48.514
And the strategy was whoever made it to the runoff,

29:49.405 --> 29:50.607
with Ron Godby.

29:50.647 --> 29:52.189
Ron Godby was a winner.

29:52.650 --> 29:59.000
Whoever made it to the runoff, chances are they would beat Godby because his support was real soft.

29:59.060 --> 30:00.282
He didn't have organization.

30:00.322 --> 30:08.916
He had angered so many people running against Teague as competitive as he was in 76.

30:09.841 --> 30:12.344
We had another guy that was Phil Graham.

30:12.804 --> 30:14.827
Phil had a ton of money in the bank already.

30:14.887 --> 30:16.689
And then we had a guy named McNeil.

30:17.170 --> 30:19.612
I forget his first name, but he was out of Alvarado.

30:19.733 --> 30:25.119
And he had made tons of money by having these auto parts stores, Don McNeil.

30:25.499 --> 30:27.362
And so he was going to drop in.

30:27.882 --> 30:32.087
He dropped in a couple hundred thousand in the race as well.

30:33.088 --> 30:34.830
And here's poor Chet.

30:34.850 --> 30:39.696
And I mean, we're chilly at Chips and chat with Chet was our receptions.

30:40.098 --> 30:41.840
We had a good base here.

30:42.280 --> 30:44.062
We had a good base in Duncanville.

30:44.943 --> 30:50.650
We had good fundraising support for some ladies up out of Alvarado and in Dallas and Fort Worth.

30:50.670 --> 30:52.752
And we came out of nowhere.

30:52.772 --> 30:56.276
And it was really fascinating because CVs were the real craze at that time.

30:56.817 --> 31:01.062
So I would make runs every other day in the district in that van.

31:01.082 --> 31:02.623
And it was very opposite.

31:02.643 --> 31:04.826
It was a Marine van with white lettering on it.

31:04.846 --> 31:05.987
It was Congress.

31:06.457 --> 31:09.241
We'd be talking on the CV all the time.

31:09.781 --> 31:14.487
You could feel the swell literally the last three weeks.

31:14.667 --> 31:17.671
We knew we were going to win and get in the runoff.

31:17.731 --> 31:20.234
And we knew if we got in the runoff, we were going to beat Ron Gottby.

31:21.096 --> 31:22.157
You could feel it.

31:22.217 --> 31:25.441
You could hear, you could see people turning out at things.

31:25.481 --> 31:34.152
You could see instead of us putting up these big signs that we were putting up on the rural country roads, people would come in and get them and put them up themselves.

31:34.587 --> 31:56.730
people were calling to asking you know where are the yard signs that I need money started to come in when Chet committed the 20,000 we did the media media by we were having we were on as much as McNeil and Graham and we had the week before I can I can remember people in Graham's headquarters here

31:56.997 --> 31:59.962
and in Duncanville saying, what are you guys doing?

31:59.982 --> 32:01.004
You've come out of nowhere.

32:01.525 --> 32:02.787
We were going to win that race.

32:04.770 --> 32:10.740
And when the votes... We were 210 votes ahead, four precincts still outstanding.

32:11.622 --> 32:17.532
The four precincts came in 24 hours late to the hour.

32:17.672 --> 32:18.413
Where were they?

32:19.114 --> 32:20.136
One was in my...
