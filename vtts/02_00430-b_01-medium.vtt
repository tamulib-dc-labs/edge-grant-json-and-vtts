Test 1, 2, 3. Test 1, 2, 3.

00:09.494 --> 00:17.966
This is the second hour of the interview with Mr. 
Benavides in regards to his time in Vietnam. Mr.

00:17.986 --> 00:29.262
Benavides, in the beginning of the war, in the 
first few years the American public was in favor of

00:17.986 --> 00:29.262
the war, what do you think changed their views in 
regards to the war? Well, I think that

00:31.942 --> 01:00.497
the generation, because of the freedom of 
speaking and the freedom that they have, or we

00:31.942 --> 01:00.497
have, is that they were exercising their freedom 
because they didn't approve of our involvement

00:31.942 --> 01:00.497
with that Asian country. they saw a way where they, 
the young generation, the youngsters, would see a

01:00.967 --> 01:13.281
way where they could keep from going to fight an 
unpopular war. I mean, who was the one that

01:13.841 --> 01:24.293
started, or who was against the United States? No 
one. It was that country, the South Vietnamese

01:25.535 --> 01:30.400
government, that needed assistance. Probably 
the legislators saw a way to where they were

01:31.510 --> 01:58.767
supporting some of the large corporations, and 
they saw a need to where the economy would rise,

01:31.510 --> 01:58.767
where they would sell products where they would 
benefit, or the large corporations would

01:31.510 --> 01:58.767
benefit. They started sending supplies and they 
sent us to guard those supplies. We were, we didn't

02:07.661 --> 02:14.651
know who we were fighting with at the time, in the 
very beginning. And so the radicals here in the

02:14.671 --> 02:21.400
United States, they didn't want to go because of 
that reason. So what they did, they sort of

02:21.420 --> 02:27.808
demonstrated against our government. This is 
some of the rights that all veterans fight for.

02:32.793 --> 02:37.419
Well, there were five of them and eight of them, but 
they were doing it. And some of them didn't go, and

02:39.321 --> 02:41.503
some of them went. Some of them went two or three 
times. Some of them died. Now, those that went are

02:45.969 --> 02:53.417
telling their children, like I found mine, why we 
went. It's helped us for a nation. to keep the

02:58.366 --> 03:05.974
communism from spreading to our country, which 
they're close by. Over here, they're south

03:06.314 --> 03:13.081
of Central America, the United States. The people 
here just take too much for granted. That's

03:18.947 --> 03:21.629
probably the reason why. They had a way before they 
could keep from going, and so they didn't go. Do you

03:27.615 --> 03:28.356
think that you know, Westmoreland started, there 
were some statements made that General

03:29.129 --> 03:43.724
Westmoreland reports were coming back that we 
were winning the war, but yet we kept sending more

03:29.129 --> 03:43.724
troops and we were escalating. Do you think that 
had any... No, I don't think, I don't think that

03:43.744 --> 03:58.420
General Westmoreland, General Westmoreland, I 
don't know, you know, I drove for him. I think that

03:59.487 --> 04:08.299
that there was a staff that he had that wasn't 
giving him the information that he wanted. And so

04:10.482 --> 04:13.386
he was reported. The general was never that much 
out in the field as he was, and every chance he got,

04:13.426 --> 04:19.894
he was out there. But the legislators, that's why 
no one justified the divorce. They kept him

04:30.908 --> 04:36.697
So you feel like Westmoreland then was not 
informed as well by his staff? Yes. I think from

04:38.038 --> 04:48.434
what I guess I can gather is that his staff was just 
not... In a way, his staff was probably thinking

04:48.454 --> 04:57.507
that they were going to help the general become 
more famous. And... Whether they knew it or not, I

04:59.393 --> 05:05.341
mean, anyone could say, hey, we killed 15 enemy 
over there. Well, when the enemy was probably

05:05.361 --> 05:09.005
villagers. And maybe out of those 15, seven were 
enemies. The other were poor, innocent people.

05:16.014 --> 05:17.696
Nevertheless, they were killed. Do you think the 
bombing in the north increased the... increase

05:25.921 --> 05:31.411
the North Vietnam's will to want to win that much 
more the more we bombed? The more they, it gave them

05:31.431 --> 05:40.908
a, we won as far as the bombing, but it gave them a 
psychological

05:31.431 --> 05:40.908
lift, maybe? Well, I think that the bombing 
increased because of our POWs and MIAs. Yes, the Ho

05:48.938 --> 06:05.439
Chi Minh Trail was full of these people, the North 
Vietnamese that were coming through to fight us

05:48.938 --> 06:05.439
and to fight the South Vietnamese. But 
psychologically, those bombs, let me tell you,

06:05.459 --> 06:13.410
that was like riders in the sky. And anyone, I don't 
care, how inhuman you are, but I mean, that's got a

06:16.343 --> 06:24.697
psychological factor involved in being 
paranoid. So I don't think that that really

06:24.717 --> 06:33.131
stopped those, you know, those enemies that much. 
I think that it was just us that didn't see the way to

06:38.163 --> 06:42.968
hurt them or to become more effective than the Cold 
War. We had, we could have won that war in two years,

06:43.028 --> 06:56.881
three years if, if, if poor General McMornell was 
left alone and, and commanded his troops the way a

06:43.028 --> 06:56.881
leader's supposed to command. I'm not saying that 
he didn't command them, that, but a leader is more

06:56.901 --> 07:08.052
effective and, and, and chose more, uh, um, of 
leadership to, in a place to where he, he is where he

07:08.875 --> 07:17.063
can most influence me. And, and, and, and Hank, you 
pick up the paper and, you know, you, well now, we

07:17.083 --> 07:30.217
saw a team deal that I never did, that Frank Fortune 
never did, and that we were way, way back in the

07:17.083 --> 07:30.217
middle. But, uh, you pick up the paper or anything 
and you listen to the radio and, and you say that,

07:30.397 --> 07:38.545
what, Manoa was ordered to Okinawa. by some 
senator and congressman or what, that was more

07:39.183 --> 07:44.188
than was ordered to Hawaii. And who was left 
running the ranch? So, and then when they enfolded

07:49.373 --> 07:58.902
it, I'm one of them that's standing behind it 100%. 
You know, LBJ was, he was pretty well, he was pretty

07:58.923 --> 08:05.349
well business oriented anyway. He was out to help 
the, you feel like the, a lot of, you know, he sent

08:09.440 --> 08:34.057
over a lot of people that were personal friends 
that owned big companies, and I know I did some

08:09.440 --> 08:34.057
readings where they, so many people came in to look 
at the war, and a lot of them were your scientists

08:09.440 --> 08:34.057
and your people with your big companies and stuff, 
and it said that that could have, you know, that

08:09.440 --> 08:34.057
Westmoreland had to spend time satisfying those 
people, you know. Oh, well, you know, he, the

08:34.577 --> 08:38.383
general was one of them that the commander of the 
commander-in-chief. I mean, you just don't say no

08:40.930 --> 08:53.541
to the commander-in-chief, but you've got other 
people that are in second command that you trust

08:40.930 --> 08:53.541
can do the job just as well as you. You know, you're 
the boss, but still, those are just those things

08:54.062 --> 09:02.189
that in our situation occur. And I think that yes, 
those big corporations, they were, you know, they

09:02.589 --> 09:08.775
wanted to see one way they could materialize, they 
could benefit by producing more machinery to the

09:09.160 --> 09:27.523
farmers there, by

09:09.160 --> 09:27.523
selling more fuel to the government. the way we 
were flying, the way we were running our vehicles,

09:27.959 --> 09:41.213
to see in what way they could sell more trucks or 
jeeps or what. And look what happened when they

09:42.755 --> 09:46.279
pulled out. I'll get you one of those reports. You 
can read it in Times Magazine in 1975, 72, stated

09:54.875 --> 10:01.222
that there was $34 million worth of equipment left 
there for the enemy to have. Do you feel like the

10:03.605 --> 10:15.258
South Vietnamese administration and Army really 
fought or tried to defend themselves as much as

10:03.605 --> 10:15.258
they could, or did they depend on the American Army 
too much? I think they depended on the American

10:15.999 --> 10:19.162
Army too much. Because, I mean, what's the sense of 
of me sacrificing my life in my own country, trying

10:24.322 --> 10:42.263
to help with what I haven't got to help with, good 
weapons or what, or I'm not intelligent enough.

10:42.283 --> 10:54.177
When I have you that are trained, and I have you to 
produce some equipment to help us in the war, I just

10:42.283 --> 10:54.177
sit back and I just lay down. I know they, in some of 
the articles I've read, they said that the

10:54.933 --> 11:10.854
administration in Saigon was not really the best 
people that they would have wanted there to begin

10:54.933 --> 11:10.854
with, that he was a rich person looking out for 
himself. He really didn't care about the peasants

11:10.874 --> 11:16.101
and villagers, you know. You know, in some of those 
papers, I don't know which one it was, There are

11:20.161 --> 11:36.743
some of those intelligence reports where there 
were some of these so-called rich Americans here

11:20.161 --> 11:36.743
that had money invested in those rubber 
plantations.

11:36.763 --> 11:48.058
And I've heard it said, quote me or not quote me, but 
I've heard it said that there were some

11:36.763 --> 11:48.058
publications, some sort of an order said that we 
would not fire into a rural plantation. So you

11:51.834 --> 11:57.740
never heard of a jet firing into a rural 
plantation, even though the Indians went right in

11:51.834 --> 11:57.740
there. What about the defoliation, the ranch 
hands? Do you think that they should have done as

12:04.026 --> 12:10.553
much as they did, or was that another case of the big 
companies? That's another case of the big

12:11.234 --> 12:13.196
companies. Manzano was one of them that... When I 
testified before the federal court in

12:15.342 --> 12:31.644
disagreeing that we, I still, I consider myself a 
victim of the agent law because I flew with the red

12:15.342 --> 12:31.644
flag. And I was in an area where it was heavily 
sprayed.

12:39.114 --> 12:42.278
I stated to the judge that Why should we accept $180 
million? That's like saying that, hey, we're

12:47.121 --> 12:56.692
putting a price tag for the service of your 
country. And we don't accept that because there's

12:56.712 --> 13:05.501
no price tag for us that serve our country. There's 
nothing to say that, hey, we give you $200 million,

13:05.762 --> 13:10.847
$300 million, and that's it. whether you live or 
die, but that's it. We don't do it. We show our

13:15.450 --> 13:19.437
country for the freedom that we're enjoying.

13:24.747 --> 13:31.519
We listened to a speaker in our class that flew with 
the ranch hands, and he defended their their view,

13:31.769 --> 13:38.295
he said that it was, all their spraying was 
necessary and that they did, that the trees would

13:31.769 --> 13:38.295
come back and all this. And he defended, he was, he 
had the opposite view that you did. Was he a doctor?

13:43.719 --> 13:45.601
No, he was a pilot for the ranch family. How did he 
know what that defoliation, what chemical that

13:45.761 --> 13:50.625
defoliation was? He said that it was nothing more 
than stuff that we sprayed our crops here with.

13:56.611 --> 13:56.851
Sure. I believe him. I believe anything he says. 
Because when he went back to his barracks, to his

14:02.195 --> 14:03.957
tent. He took those clothes off that he had. And he 
took a good shower. He brushed his teeth. We

14:10.543 --> 14:11.865
didn't. We stayed two or three days with our own 
clothes. We didn't take no bath. Sure, I believe

14:16.889 --> 14:19.012
what he said. But why wasn't he down on the ground 
with us? And eating the food that we ate. And

14:25.458 --> 14:26.919
sleeping under those trees. I mean, did he go back 
again to see if those trees were How many tours did

14:31.186 --> 14:34.370
he have in Vietnam? I don't remember what he said. I 
can understand, but yes, I believe him. But I

14:39.636 --> 14:41.998
disagree with what he said. Because he hadn't seen 
these youngsters here in Austin or over here in

14:43.340 --> 14:52.250
Houston or in Liberty or something. In Dickerson, 
these youngsters, their fingers are just like

14:52.270 --> 14:58.858
toothpicks. Their ears are... or taped against 
their head. He hadn't seen no jumpers. And their

15:07.250 --> 15:08.592
father was right there. And, no, he just flew, and 
then that's all. He was an officer, and that's all.

15:16.463 --> 15:19.527
But he wasn't on the ground.

15:20.909 --> 15:22.011
I disagree with that. I'm sorry. You served, how 
many tours did you serve? Two tours. Two tours. And

15:25.616 --> 15:26.918
your first tour was in? In 1965. It was there in the 
heavily, uh, uh, jungle area in Tamkeen, Kwanai.

15:37.800 --> 15:44.628
I was an advisor to the Vietnamese Airborne Ranger 
Battalion there.

15:46.450 --> 15:53.719
When we traveled, uh, we walked all through around 
the Black Virgin Mountains in those areas there.

15:53.739 --> 15:57.623
And, uh, I used to, used to go to Pang Campound there 
in Tam Kee and hitch a flight with them back to Da

15:58.598 --> 16:05.364
Nang or to Quang Ngai. And we'd take Vietnamese 
villagers too. We'd put little chickens in there

16:09.888 --> 16:16.313
and everybody carried their own little farm with 
them and little cages. And I'd fly back to Tam Kee or

16:16.734 --> 16:24.480
Quang Ngai or wherever they were going to pick me up 
at. And when was your second tour? The second tour

16:26.222 --> 16:27.863
was in 68. And that was after the war had really 
escalated, isn't it? That was during the Tet

16:31.913 --> 16:34.836
Offense. That was when our beloved President 
Johnson asked for, I think, 50,000 more troops.

16:43.725 --> 16:55.656
And that was when the information

16:43.725 --> 16:55.656
was coming out that General McMorrin was asking 
for more troops. He thought that we'd have the war

16:56.159 --> 17:03.590
won if we did more. The Agent Orange spray did help 
us in a way, but there were some of those troops that

17:03.630 --> 17:25.322
were very disappointed and discouraged in what 
the government or the society back home were

17:03.630 --> 17:25.322
doing. They were treated like third-class 
citizens. They had no respect, no respect

17:29.941 --> 17:49.959
whatsoever for what we were doing, for what men 
quit school to go to serve their country, to

17:29.941 --> 17:49.959
protect the integrity of the President of the 
United States, to save this country from

17:29.941 --> 17:49.959
embarrassment. And they burned the American 
flag. They actually destroyed their own freedom

17:56.302 --> 17:58.104
And right now, they're enjoying it. They're 
enjoying it with one thought in mind. When they

18:02.650 --> 18:08.457
hear about the soldiers, you know, they think in a 
way. They think that right there at Rotary Club,

18:08.477 --> 18:16.307
the president of that Rotary Club right there was 
one of them that turned their back on them and went

18:08.477 --> 18:16.307
to Canada. And he told them with tears in his eyes 
that I shamed him. I said, no, I didn't shame you.

18:23.656 --> 18:24.537
You shamed yourself. I said, now you're back here 
in Houston, Texas, enjoying freedom that they've

18:26.069 --> 18:32.196
given my brother's life. I said, you're a coward. 
You could have been up there and saved two or three

18:34.339 --> 18:39.606
lives, even though it was a non-popular war. Do you 
think that the United States people, every war

18:39.626 --> 18:49.798
we've been in before, the longest war we were ever 
in lasted only four years, and that was a civil war.

18:50.285 --> 19:01.281
You think the American people just became so 
disillusioned because the war drug on so long, you

18:50.285 --> 19:01.281
know, that our mental state was that, you know, we 
go in and we win a war quick, and this one drug on. Do

19:01.301 --> 19:04.285
you think that was part of the disillusionment? I 
think that was one of the reasons of the government

19:04.305 --> 19:12.617
or society turning against us. And I think that the 
other was the legislators. Washington. But why

19:18.247 --> 19:20.610
should we be blaming the American soldiers? We're 
only obeying the orders of the American soldiers.

19:25.936 --> 19:31.783
I mean, I'm proud to be a veteran of the Vietnam era. 
Heck, even if I was a Korean veteran, which I served

19:31.804 --> 19:41.015
in Korea, too, right at the ceasefire time. But I 
served my country, honestly, in a place where And

19:47.002 --> 20:00.076
the public does not want to understand that 
soldiers are taken out, irregardless of whether

19:47.002 --> 20:00.076
that commander-in-chief, the president of the 
United States is wrong or right, he's got to obey

19:47.002 --> 20:00.076
those orders. So why should he be condemned 
because he was ordered to go and fight in another

20:00.096 --> 20:10.608
country where it's an unpopular war? Why not 
prosecute the legislators that assisted the

20:15.250 --> 20:20.396
President, the Commander-in-Chief to send us 
over there. Now, why did they approve those

20:20.416 --> 20:33.189
people, the lost son, and there was an accident and 
there was nine women that were lost and they were

20:20.416 --> 20:33.189
murdered. Why are they so any guiltless now? And 
how can they say that they're proud Americans?

20:41.761 --> 20:46.729
They disobeyed the laws of the present. And if 
those legislators can just tell us what they want

20:46.749 --> 20:59.469
done, and not tell us how they want us to do these 
things, that war could be won, I understand, in two

20:46.749 --> 20:59.469
years, three years. Incidentally, the Civil War 
lasted four years, that's right. The Second World

21:03.896 --> 21:07.121
War lasted four years. But the hardest fighting of 
those four years for almost six months, total of

21:09.689 --> 21:13.634
four years. We fought for 10 years, 10 years, day 
and night. We had to protect ourselves from our own

21:18.520 --> 21:37.384
shadow because we didn't know what little kid 
would come up and throw a hanger at us because he was

21:18.520 --> 21:37.384
doing it for food for his mother and father that 
this agent, enemy agent, would tell him, Just

21:37.702 --> 21:42.767
throw that right there and I'll give you a case of 
food or I'll give you this. Now, that little kid, he

21:42.787 --> 21:45.730
was an enemy to me. If he threw a hanging egg, 
whether he realized it or not, I wasn't going to

21:46.911 --> 21:56.160
stand there and say, hey, little boy, you did 
wrong. I mean, why? That's why they call us baby

21:57.521 --> 22:04.508
killers

21:57.521 --> 22:04.508
and all that. And what we didn't do regular or 
any... any American would do in a case like that.

22:11.037 --> 22:12.759
Get the hand grenade and throw it back at them 
again.

22:15.782 --> 22:17.584
No, it was hard. It was very hard for us. And then to 
come back, and they spit on you in a uniform. You,

22:24.231 --> 22:25.973
the defender of this country.

22:28.656 --> 22:35.603
Those people who sit here and watch TV, a big ball 
game, while those guys are right now standing

22:28.656 --> 22:35.603
guard. 24 hours a day around this land of ours. And 
what do we do? We criticize our own, us, ourselves.

22:47.767 --> 22:49.469
What do we do to these youngsters? These 
youngsters won't want to go into the service. They

22:52.651 --> 22:53.132
don't care. But what about us after we're dead? We 
won't worry about them. If we ever have another

22:58.316 --> 23:01.419
war, do you think they'll have to use the draft? I 
hope so. I've always said, even in these schools

23:03.000 --> 23:06.383
where I talk, You know, it's a matter of pride that, 
to be an American, you know, there's a saying, and I

23:07.848 --> 23:20.243
saw this, I saw a sign. Did you read that buddy of 
mine that wrote just after, because of a certain

23:20.423 --> 23:27.932
neighbor right here who criticized me? Yeah. He 
said, for those that have fought for it, lives have

23:28.292 --> 23:34.520
a special flavor. The protected ones never know. 
And I think that every young man and woman, I'm not

23:38.729 --> 23:54.889
saying that they should, I think, that if they, 
they should donate two or three years of their time

23:38.729 --> 23:54.889
to the defense of this country. Why wait until you 
graduate? Sure you can go to college, but why not,

23:57.452 --> 24:03.279
you know, why not say, hey, I want to be part of a 
team? You know, it's great when you And you feel

24:07.265 --> 24:09.307
that Americanism in you. When you hear that 
national anthem, you feel the cold shield up and

24:09.487 --> 24:16.693
down your arms. And your heart kind of takes a deep 
beat. Because that means you're proud. You're

24:22.579 --> 24:26.802
proud to be an

24:22.579 --> 24:26.802
American. And we only see those through color. I 
think these youngsters, instead of getting high

24:29.545 --> 24:36.411
on drugs and booze, they get high on education. do 
something for themselves, the community, and

24:37.707 --> 24:41.392
their country. Because they're the future 
leaders. You know, another thing that they blame,

24:43.915 --> 24:53.667
they say that a lot of the soldiers, you know, 
drugs, a lot of them got started on drugs over in

24:43.915 --> 24:53.667
Vietnam and brought that back here. No, I tell you, 
there was more dope, cattle, and there was more

24:53.707 --> 25:06.803
marijuana smoke in one year in these colleges here 
than there was in 10 years in Vietnam. See, you only

25:08.150 --> 25:10.693
hear the bad things. You only hear the bad things. 
You don't hear the good things. Well, you heard

25:14.597 --> 25:17.400
that tape of the president. They made a meet.

25:22.145 --> 25:24.647
The news media, they're the worst. They were, and 
now they're fighting against them, too. Hey, why

25:28.271 --> 25:29.532
should they print this? I mean, even, well, it's 
true or what? Does the public really want to hear

25:32.475 --> 25:34.017
that? Public, or do they want to see this? They 
don't want to see that. They only want to see what a

25:38.716 --> 25:40.619
good soldier does. They know that we do bad 
sometimes.

25:46.929 --> 26:04.617
So, you know, you feel, so a lot of times, a lot of the 
bad publicity that the war got was partially due to

25:46.929 --> 26:04.617
the news media because they only, what they showed 
on the TV to the people were things like my may lie

25:46.929 --> 26:04.617
and all that, you know, and that's what got all the 
publicity, not the Not the rewards, y'all were,

26:05.710 --> 26:08.493
you know, the help that you got. The building 
churches, helping the orphanage, helping the

26:08.513 --> 26:14.340
leprosy. All they showed on TV was how many people 
were killed and how many, even women and children,

26:14.901 --> 26:23.291
and they really played this all up. Those 
reporters, and I know because Peter Jennings was

26:23.331 --> 26:30.840
with them, he's a good, honest, truthful man, and 
he was right there with us. I know because we flew

26:30.940 --> 26:33.203
together out of Kwong Nai. He was wounded, I think. 
He got sprained on his leg, I think. We were getting

26:38.961 --> 26:41.064
shot up in bed that day. But these reporters, they 
wouldn't go. They wouldn't go to a village where we

26:43.687 --> 26:55.603
went and they'd see that little kid throw a hanging 
or that old lady throw a hanging or a hanging drop

26:43.687 --> 26:55.603
out. They wouldn't show that kind of thing. They'd 
take off like a scared jackrabbit. But they would

27:00.489 --> 27:02.852
see if the soldier shouldn't. Because they knew 
that they were V.C. soldiers in North Washington.

27:06.928 --> 27:10.232
That's what the public over here would see. They 
wouldn't show up hanging and know they're going to

27:10.272 --> 27:13.056
get covered first.

27:16.260 --> 27:19.725
And in a way, our own men did us wrong. Our own, just 
to make themselves look good. And they were

27:28.377 --> 27:32.923
telling themselves.

27:33.477 --> 27:38.063
How come they wouldn't go with the special forces? 
They didn't take too much with them.

27:44.092 --> 27:53.485
Do you think that the involvement of moving the war 
into Cambodia and Laos also caused

27:44.092 --> 27:53.485
disillusionment with the American people? 
Because here we weren't able to win the war in

27:53.525 --> 28:03.298
Vietnam, and now we were moving into two countries 
that the people considered weren't involved. in

28:03.599 --> 28:04.800
the war? No, but I don't think that we were moving 
the warrants there. I think that we were just given

28:08.824 --> 28:11.287
permission. That's when the North started 
finding out that we could win, that we were given

28:11.887 --> 28:23.418
permission to chase enemies there. And the 
villages there, of course, they didn't want no

28:23.438 --> 28:32.107
part of it, and especially the bombing. I think 
that That the whole mess was just part of the

28:34.345 --> 28:45.620
legislators in our government. They just didn't 
want us to win. Because of production of

28:48.824 --> 28:51.568
materials. It's big money. That's right. That war 
is going to become very famous in five years from

28:54.872 --> 29:00.540
now. And enough soldiers. are getting together 
more, especially the women veterans. You know,

29:07.517 --> 29:09.440
they have bumper stickers. Women are veterans, 
too. And you should have seen this over there in

29:12.044 --> 29:17.391
Washington, the Memorial of Education. I mean, 
there was women nurses that some of these men found

29:17.531 --> 29:25.823
that they hadn't seen in 15, 20 years. There's one 
of them that threw herself over this patient

29:25.843 --> 29:31.892
because they were shelling that That area, it's 
just like a mass unit. And he has a very emotional

29:36.364 --> 29:39.829
side, let me tell you. You know, two guys, they 
started crying, and that girl, all she could say, I

29:39.849 --> 29:44.395
love you, I love you, shut up. Yeah, it was very 
emotional. You see that these youngsters, when

29:48.139 --> 29:55.749
they go see the names on that wall, they thought it 
was their father there. And then they read some

29:55.769 --> 30:01.997
good things about the veterans. It's going to 
become, they're turning, they're turning, these

30:02.230 --> 30:06.977
youngsters now. Especially, I don't, I didn't 
like to hear or read about that young lady that

30:07.778 --> 30:16.570
wouldn't stand up because of the National Anthem 
that played up in Massachusetts. Maybe her

30:16.590 --> 30:21.697
parents, that's the way the kids are brought up. 
But yet she's enjoying freedom. She's enjoying

30:23.780 --> 30:27.385
going to the piece of HUD and everything. And I know 
that she'd rather be here than be in in Russia, in

30:30.361 --> 30:42.797
Czechoslovakia somewhere, to be told when to turn 
off the light and when to put it on, when to go out on

30:30.361 --> 30:42.797
the street and when not to.

30:42.817 --> 30:53.512
So, we really don't realize what freedom we have 
until, unless we would go somewhere else and see

30:42.817 --> 30:53.512
how people live and how they're treated. That's 
exactly right. That is exactly right. I have a book

30:58.306 --> 31:06.778
right there that was written by a priest that 
escaped chapter Leviticus. And his greatest

31:06.798 --> 31:12.106
crime, now he wasn't a priest, he was a great 
athlete. His greatest crime that they would...
