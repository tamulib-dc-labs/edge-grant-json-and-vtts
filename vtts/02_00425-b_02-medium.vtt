WEBVTT

00:01.246 --> 00:02.909
Yeah, well, we're at Guam.

00:06.334 --> 00:07.135
All right. My citation speaks for itself. Yeah, I 
would. I already read my citation.

00:28.288 --> 00:29.650
The people I prosecuted There was a guy that came up 
there to Guam, had three stripes on him, and they

00:31.013 --> 00:45.854
charged him with selling whiskey at $50 or $75 a 
bottle. I locked the son of a bitch up just like

00:45.874 --> 00:47.937
that. He said, you can't lock me up. I said, no. He 
said, I'm an officer. They want to lock you up.

00:57.009 --> 01:00.514
Well, I'll teach you how to sell whiskey around 
these islands for $75 a quart. They locked that son

01:01.068 --> 01:06.495
of a bitch up right there on Guam. Then sent some 
more of the same thing. What happened to them? Then

01:12.923 --> 01:15.766
they finally got the WSA Admiral Lambs. Admiral 
Lambs was head of the War Shipping

01:17.188 --> 01:19.511
Administration. Then through him, they come down 
and got him out and put him off the island. Was he

01:25.358 --> 01:26.299
prosecuted? Huh? Was he a prosecutor? Well, I 
didn't have anything to do with the courts on Guam.

01:30.733 --> 01:31.333
Oh, okay, okay. Well, I locked the bastards up and 
put them in the stockade. But he wasn't going to be

01:37.521 --> 01:39.343
put in that stockade. I didn't have any goddamn 
places to put people, you know.

01:47.693 --> 01:49.215
Put them where I could put them, that's all.

01:52.216 --> 01:55.241
I was a little bit acid, I'll admit, but you know 
what I mean. I was taught that way by my commanding

01:55.341 --> 01:57.585
general. You know? Mm-hmm. Will you tell me how you 
got the Legion of Merit? I'm going to tell you in a

02:06.400 --> 02:07.683
minute. The Bronze Star? I'm trying to find it now. 
Okay. I'm going to take it.

02:20.718 --> 02:23.881
Because I'd like to find out why you got the Bronze 
Star in the Legion of Merit. All

02:24.562 --> 02:30.647
right. That's on. In the name of the President of 
the United States, Commander Marianas, the

02:32.029 --> 02:46.362

sound judgment, and able administrative ability

were major factors which contributed materially 
to the early successful function of the Island

advising the island commander in connection with

03:36.908 --> 03:47.060

04:23.485 --> 04:24.727
Now, why'd you get the brown star? All right, well, 
I'll give you this one of these. I think I have two.

04:28.472 --> 04:28.652
Oh, good. I believe I got... Well, you're kidding 
me. All right, so I traded for the brown star.

05:11.864 --> 05:15.870
These are all letters of congratulations they 
sent along with you.

05:20.156 --> 05:23.961
And you got this from the 20th Air Force, the Bronze 
Star from the 20th Air Force. In the Army. And the

protection of ammunition, explosives, and 
inflammable material in storage and in transit.

06:21.389 --> 06:37.828
During the crucial period of the combat 
preparation, his exceptional skill and

06:21.389 --> 06:37.828
organization ability were conspicuous evidence 
in the able manner in which he expedited the

06:21.389 --> 06:37.828
movement of troops, supplies, and ammunition 
with the utmost safety and dispatch. over rules

06:38.264 --> 06:47.115
which were in process of construction, thereby 
contributing greatly to the commencement of

06:38.264 --> 06:47.115
operations against the enemy on schedule. 
Through his deceitful judgment, foresight, and

06:47.576 --> 06:58.329
unremitting devotion to duty, Colonel Baraka 
made a notable contribution to support the combat

06:47.576 --> 06:58.329
operations.

07:00.572 --> 07:02.314
And when did you leave? as Provost Marshal of Guam 
and go to this brief duty of China, but you don't

07:03.509 --> 07:08.558
tell us anything. Well, I know that was just while I 
was still on duty in Guam, I was still assigned.

07:14.209 --> 07:15.611
Well, why'd they send you to China? Well, they sent 
me up there on a trip to, first to observe the They

07:23.405 --> 07:31.097
served Kinsen, Pekin, Tsing Wan Tao, and 
Shanghai, where we Marines had all served and were

07:23.405 --> 07:31.097
still there. Uh-huh. And what kind of—were you 
supposed to make a report? I didn't make any report

07:35.663 --> 07:36.945
at all. Well, why—to observe them? Well, why did 
they— Observe them? They wanted me to have that

07:41.072 --> 07:42.594
experience. That was all. Oh, I see. I had nothing 
to do after that. What did you think about it? What

07:46.360 --> 07:47.241
did you think about China? Great country. Great 
country. It's a shame the Communists were

07:50.366 --> 07:52.028
running.

07:56.243 --> 07:59.047
What did you think about the Chinese people that 
you met? I liked them. I

08:02.372 --> 08:07.480
liked them. He wanted to copy

08:07.500 --> 08:23.343
this

08:07.500 --> 08:23.343
one. I don't know. I don't see...

08:29.116 --> 08:45.077
I better check in on that blonde star business 
someplace I don't know where they

08:29.116 --> 08:45.077
are. Citation for it. I got the damn thing. Well, 
you just read it. The bronze star citation. You

08:51.204 --> 08:51.865
just read it. Right here. You just read that.

09:00.419 --> 09:23.733
I don't...

09:00.419 --> 09:23.733
And did you leave Guam then in January of 1946 to 
become the island commander? No, no. This is all

09:26.577 --> 09:28.099
under the island commander. Okay, okay. I'm 
trying to find my damn citation. This one or you're

09:37.439 --> 09:43.367
just kidding? I wish to express my gratification 
upon the recognition of your meritorious

09:43.427 --> 09:54.502
achievement in connection with the military 
operation against the enemy on Guam, 17th of

09:43.427 --> 09:54.502
January to 2nd of September, 1945. It is evident by 
the award you have received a Bronze Star with

09:54.622 --> 09:58.928
citations by the commanding general, United 
States Army Forces Pacific, and by direction of

09:59.178 --> 10:05.407
the President of the United States. That's what 
you got into the record. That's who gave it to me.

10:08.452 --> 10:09.814
And who signed that? Huh? Who sent that letter to 
you? Vandegrift. So he must have had the stuff in

10:12.818 --> 10:16.203
front of him someplace. I don't have, I have only 
the citation, but I don't, but he tells me who it's

10:16.303 --> 10:21.731
signed by. That's all I want to know. Did I give you 
one of those? Yeah, right, yeah. What have you got,

10:27.681 --> 10:29.303
the Legion of Merit? Yeah, I have it. But you don't 
have a bronze star. Well, you only have one copy, so

10:31.987 --> 10:37.215
maybe you should keep it. Well, you got it in the 
record, didn't you? Yeah, well, you just read it to

10:38.657 --> 10:40.920
the record. Okay. Let's see here. So that takes 
care of

10:45.387 --> 10:50.054
that. Well... And then let's continue on this.

10:56.637 --> 10:57.438
About Guam. When did you leave Guam?

11:10.497 --> 11:12.920
Oh, um, 1946. Wait a minute.

11:18.508 --> 11:23.235
What is the... What is the, uh, the, uh...

11:26.860 --> 11:30.185
What is the Legion of Merit? What does it say? From 
what dates to what dates? 2 September 1945.

11:37.476 --> 11:43.945
Alright, well I left there in 1940. What time is it? 
September? Yeah. But you see here on this other...

12:03.648 --> 12:04.930
That'd be 46 then. Okay, so you left in 1946. Come 
along in there. Okay, and then you returned

12:09.918 --> 12:13.003
directly to Camp Pendleton? Camp Pendleton. 
After you left Guam? That's right. And then at Camp

12:19.614 --> 12:28.609
Pendleton, then I took a leave and I had to come back 
there because they were talking about trying to

12:19.614 --> 12:28.609
get me to to stay on active duty. You were a full 
colonel now. Yeah. But the way everything went

12:35.797 --> 12:46.091
out, I'm glad it didn't because I would have had to 
sacrifice too much here and reestablish myself.

12:46.111 --> 12:46.932
In Houston? Yeah. Because I had property and stuff 
here and I had a wife here. So you decided in 1946

12:53.181 --> 12:57.347
that you— They decided. Hell, I'd have stayed as a 
damn fool. I'd have stayed on, I guess, and took the

13:00.762 --> 13:07.148
whipping, I guess. But I'm glad it worked out that 
way. But the Marines then decided that it was time

13:09.030 --> 13:14.736
for your retirement? No, it was time to go back to 
inactive duty. To go to inactive duty. But you

13:19.661 --> 13:21.683
wanted to stay on active duty. I'd have sooner 
stayed, yeah. But anyhow, because... But I had

13:25.306 --> 13:29.331
property back here, and it would be a sacrifice if I 
did. But anyhow, I couldn't stay on for just a few

13:29.351 --> 13:32.134
more years. I'd have to retire anyhow, you see. So 
what was the point? You know, it wasn't at my age.

13:38.381 --> 13:38.762
Okay. So you went back to reserve duty at Corpus 
Christi Naval Air Station? All right. Well,

13:45.490 --> 13:48.133
that's where that was my last station. Okay. I had 
to go there. Okay. So tell me about that. Well,

13:54.134 --> 13:58.001
that's just there, and you... What were you in 
charge of? Huh? Nothing. Nothing. I was just in

14:00.244 --> 14:01.206
transit. Oh, okay, in transit. So you were a 
colonel in transit. I got to see my good buddies

14:04.932 --> 14:07.176
that was there. Sure. So you went from Camp 
Pendleton to Corvus Christi Naval Air Station,

14:08.819 --> 14:15.630
and then back to... You were a lead from active duty 
in 1947? 47, I forget what time. All right, and

14:21.979 --> 14:24.904
organized a volunteer training unit in Houston. 
Okay, at this time you were still a colonel. That's

14:27.287 --> 14:28.409
right. And you graduated in the industrial 
mobilization course. I took that. What was the

14:32.395 --> 14:34.639
industrial mobilization course? It's all about 
stocking up material for war. There's a diploma

14:39.667 --> 14:40.949
sitting over there. You can look at that thing. 
Okay. And then you served on Policy Board 8 Marine

14:43.758 --> 14:48.023
Corps District. That's right, in New Orleans. 
Okay, and? In the Promotion Board at Headquarters

14:52.608 --> 14:55.431
Marine Corps. Okay.

14:59.676 --> 15:01.598
But tell me about these reserve duties.

15:04.661 --> 15:07.825
Well, they got full pay and everything.

15:10.910 --> 15:13.193
Were you in charge? Well, I was always a senior, you 
know. The volunteer training unit, my God, man, I

15:18.079 --> 15:29.392
had 200 and something Marine Reserve officers, so 
I had to get rid of the aviators and set them off for

15:18.079 --> 15:29.392
themselves. And what did I say I was looking for? 
Well, we were talking about the industrial

15:35.598 --> 15:40.926
mobilization course, and you got up and started 
looking for something. I said I had a diploma here

15:40.966 --> 15:46.534
at some place. I was wondering what you did on the 
8th Corps, on the policy board. Well, on the policy

15:51.201 --> 15:54.466
board, you set the policy for the whole district. 
Okay, and how large is that district? Oh, hell, it

15:57.170 --> 16:04.862
run into

15:57.170 --> 16:04.862
Oklahoma, Arizona at that time. Southern Reserve 
District, the Reserve District. See, we had

16:07.850 --> 16:09.652
troops in all these places. By that time, you had 
organized reserves, battalions, all these

16:09.972 --> 16:15.479
places. That's what that policy board was about. 
Okay, and you set the policy, but you weren't the

16:19.503 --> 16:23.348
senior officer. Yes, I was. Oh, you were the senior 
officer. And the guy, you know what Tabasco Sauce

16:26.051 --> 16:28.734
is? So you were the director, you were the CO. 
Tabasco Sauce is, Tabasco Sauce, McElhinney,

16:34.289 --> 16:38.680
McElhinney was one of the finest combat battalion 
Marine Corps ever had in history. And he's the guy

16:39.563 --> 16:43.653
that runs that Spice Island down there, Tabasco 
South. And he's a big, he retired him as a brigadier

16:43.753 --> 16:49.007
without pay because he didn't have enough time in. 
But he's a guy that's a big beneficiary of the

16:49.561 --> 16:54.649
Marine Military Academy down here that somebody 
better take cognizance of. He's doing a good job.

16:55.770 --> 16:56.431
Oh, great. All right, down there we are. Well, what 
kind of policies did you come up with? Were you the

17:02.821 --> 17:04.463
CO of that then? No, I was a senior member. They put 
certain propositions in front of you, and we had to

17:06.366 --> 17:12.275
discuss them and pass on them. Okay. The whole 
district. Were there any that you thought were

17:14.418 --> 17:18.323
really important that should be on tape? No. I 
think that everything they were doing was

17:18.923 --> 17:21.950
according to training. The troops were being 
trained properly, the armors were being

17:21.970 --> 17:32.916
constructed, the units were being organized, and 
the people were attending the business. And then

17:33.638 --> 17:37.863
you had two tours of duty at headquarters U.S. 
Marine Corps Promotion Board. Yeah, I've got

17:37.904 --> 17:39.065
pictures of that. So you were in charge. Where is 
that? At Washington, D.C. Okay, and you were in

17:42.489 --> 17:43.711
charge. No, I wasn't in charge. I was just a member 
of the board. Right, you were a member of the board,

17:46.394 --> 17:53.724
and you were reviewing people's service records 
to make recommendations? Promotion. Okay.

17:58.327 --> 17:59.889
pictures of them over there somewhere. And would 
you go, how long were you there? Well, each tour

18:03.114 --> 18:05.317
lasted two weeks. Okay. And you'd do this every 
year, once every two? I did two tours. Okay, okay.

18:11.886 --> 18:17.053
So that's the way that you'd fill your active 
reserve by going to that? Sure, that's right.

18:19.797 --> 18:19.897
Okay. And then you remained active in various 
assignments, for example, until 1955 when you

18:19.917 --> 18:27.388
retired. That's right. But what were some of those 
assignments? Well, uh, the, uh, this volunteer

18:30.804 --> 18:39.952
training unit took a couple hours commanding off 
of that until practically retired. Mm-hmm.

18:40.212 --> 18:40.452
Mm-hmm. Okay. And we met every week. Okay. How'd 
you make general? I told you on that combat

18:46.517 --> 18:53.183
citation.

18:53.203 --> 18:53.503
Mm-hmm. On retirement, under the law. Okay. They 
had to promote me. And

18:58.334 --> 19:07.467
I read your citations.

19:07.688 --> 19:08.569
Yeah, I know. I participated in visitation rites 
of the Vietnam veterans. I got pictures there

19:14.137 --> 19:21.328
where I went down to Corpus Christi two or three 
times and decorated those people and all that

19:14.137 --> 19:21.328
stuff. Pictures of all that. And I said, I'm a 
member of the military affairs committee of the

19:24.355 --> 19:29.623
chamber of all veterans, all grades in the 
American Marine Corps Reserve. There's my

19:29.643 --> 19:31.306
chapter window. You can pull that right down 
there, take them pictures off of there. Right

19:35.492 --> 19:35.753
here. Oh, no, no, over there. Underneath there, 
you can see. Yeah, I saw that. All right, okay.

19:46.669 --> 19:47.971
My chapter won that twice. Mm-hmm. They have a 
chapter named after me. Yeah, I know that. How did

19:52.186 --> 19:53.289
that come about? How did it come about that they 
named a reserve corps chapter after you? Because

19:56.939 --> 20:01.753
the other chapter was named after

20:19.317 --> 20:21.761
The other one was named after John W. Thompson? No, 
the chapter was named that. See?

20:27.769 --> 20:35.601
And they decided, well,

20:27.769 --> 20:35.601
they'd honored him long enough so they wanted to 
honor me, so they named it. And these were your men

20:37.143 --> 20:38.845
who named it for you? No, Marine officers. But 
these are formerly your subordinates? Some of

20:45.912 --> 20:48.174
these men have been your subordinates? Not 
enlisted men. Some of them officers have been my

20:49.256 --> 20:51.037
subordinates. I see.

20:55.022 --> 20:55.162
Uh-huh. Did you want to retire from the Marine 
Corps in 55 or would you rather have stayed? By age,

20:59.426 --> 21:00.668
I had to under the law. Yeah. Okay.

21:07.655 --> 21:10.719
I got various letters appreciating every place I 
served. In fact, those natives in Samoa

21:18.565 --> 21:22.090
They come up.

21:22.571 --> 21:27.018
My deputy came to me and he said, they're meeting 
over there. They want you. I said, what do they want

21:28.860 --> 21:30.062
me about? He said, they want to talk to you. The high 
chief got up and he said, you have shown us the

21:34.209 --> 21:38.615
light. You've shown us how to work. You've shown us 
how to appreciate America. We want you to extend

21:42.701 --> 21:46.187
your duty as a lawyer, seeley, seeley. That means 
high lawyer. So I had to tell them, no, I want the

21:48.383 --> 21:51.987
orders right now. If the war is going the other way, 
I don't want to stay there. And I went on, you see.

21:56.031 --> 21:57.353
Well, that was nice of them to say. Sure it was. Oh, 
yeah, they all respected me. I had no trouble. When

22:01.017 --> 22:07.964
they found out that I didn't know bullshit, that I 
wasn't going to trade pussy for, you know, for

22:01.017 --> 22:07.964
favor. Is that on the record? Yeah, now I'm turning 
it back on. Oh, wait, we're going to... We're not

22:17.628 --> 22:18.689
done yet, are we? Can I ask you some more questions? 
Yeah. Okay, so I wanted to ask you, how did you feel

22:24.197 --> 22:31.728
on the day of your retirement? Do you remember? Did 
you feel pretty sad about it? Well, not exactly. I

22:38.077 --> 22:41.982
did in a way, yes, but...

22:43.109 --> 22:47.095
You know, those times I had to come to everybody.

22:50.140 --> 22:57.873
And of course, I got pictures there with the 
military, the Chamber of Commerce, the Honored

22:50.140 --> 22:57.873
Men and so forth and so on and all that. So, you know, 
I'm proud to be a Marine. I went to the convention

23:03.502 --> 23:08.610
in New Orleans the end of May. I'm the oldest guy 
there all the time, but I promised John Smith I'd

23:09.164 --> 23:15.730
always be there. I'm Mads Smith, you know, heard of 
him maybe. So that's that. Well can we talk, I'd

23:21.615 --> 23:35.788
just like to talk about A&M just a little bit here, 
and you know some people say that A&M is more than

23:21.615 --> 23:35.788
just a college or a university, that it's 
something, it's more than just that. Do you agree,

23:36.249 --> 23:38.631
and if it is, what do you think it is? It's a 
fraternity. It's a way of life.

23:45.448 --> 23:46.389
It's a way of life. It's a religion, just like being 
a Marine.

23:54.180 --> 24:02.732
It's a satisfaction within one to know he's an 
Aggie and he's accomplished something. And not

24:03.153 --> 24:08.020
only him has he accomplished, but others have in 
every walk of life. And that's why I say it's a

24:08.100 --> 24:09.782
fraternity, though. Okay, well, what ways do you 
think that A&M changed your life? I don't know if

24:18.506 --> 24:20.269
A&M changed my life. A&M molded my life. It didn't 
change my life. Moved it? Molded it. Molded it.

24:25.519 --> 24:27.583
Okay, well, how did it mold it then? Well, I'm not 
unhappy with the happenings in my life. No, I

24:33.234 --> 24:34.116
mean... I don't understand. Would you explain 
what you mean by molded? Well, molding my life

24:37.963 --> 24:42.067
means that I can look around at a fellow Aggies, and 
I'm proud of them. They're proud of me. But I have

24:43.789 --> 24:45.711
given, too. I've been a member of the Ex-Student 
Association, on the board of directors of the

24:45.731 --> 24:51.237
Ex-Student Association. I've been president of 
the Houston A&M Club. I've given, and I've been

24:53.840 --> 24:57.384
interested in young people. I've been on 
recruiting tours for the Marine Corps, I mean for

24:57.804 --> 25:00.627
the With athletics, I've been on recruiting for 
scholars. And I get up all my, I go down to that A&M

25:06.057 --> 25:10.864
club every Monday that I can.

25:15.450 --> 25:16.372
I do all I can do. Okay. Do you think that, I want to 
ask you as a general, how does somebody who's been a

25:18.995 --> 25:28.909
success in the military, Do you think that you've 
become a success in the military the same way you do

25:30.745 --> 25:37.073
as a lawyer or any other professional field?

25:39.776 --> 25:44.221
No, because everybody will have the opportunity 
to show what they can do. I was lucky that a general

25:45.323 --> 25:51.370
had faith in me and knew what I could do. That's when 
it took away from one staff to another. Generals

25:54.454 --> 25:55.996
would fight for my service. I'm not being 
braggadocious about it. Because they knew I'd

25:58.876 --> 26:00.138
work. I was stupid enough to work. There was no 
politics to me. I just called it like it is. That's

26:06.928 --> 26:07.369
it. Would you have considered yourself 
ambitious?

26:14.780 --> 26:17.364
Perhaps if I were more ambitious, maybe I'd have 
acquired more. I've been a million-dollar

26:17.524 --> 26:20.889
bracket once. I don't mean to be braggadocious 
about it, but I'm glad I'm not in that anymore. But

26:25.032 --> 26:34.204
when you were in the military, did you ever, was 
there a time when you thought that you might want to

26:25.032 --> 26:34.204
be a general or did you just sort of leave your 
advancement to, well, your superiors? No, I

26:34.664 --> 26:36.526
never, I never thought. The only thing I ever 
wanted out of the Marine Corps was to be qualified

26:36.547 --> 26:42.674
to be the globe eagle and anchor. That was my only 
thought of affiliation with the service because I

26:44.296 --> 26:51.225
was proud to be a Marine.

27:00.031 --> 27:09.265
What do you think, in your whole military career as 
a Marine, what do you think, when you look back on

27:00.031 --> 27:09.265
it, what do you think were the best 
accomplishments?

27:11.668 --> 27:15.314
Because you've had a really rich career out of Guam 
and Samoa and things like that. What did you think

27:15.594 --> 27:19.340
was the best thing, your best accomplishment? I 
think they were both good. And I think if I had made a

27:21.984 --> 27:28.654
reputation back in Samoa, I wouldn't have mounted 
anything up in... In Guam, because that was a big,

27:29.765 --> 27:32.028
big job. That was bigger than that native job down 
there because I was head of these things and I could

27:32.068 --> 27:38.838
almost do all that. But this thing here was nuts. I 
had to deal with all military personnel here,

27:40.941 --> 27:45.288
Japanese prisoners and things like that. This way 
I had military personnel also to back me up and back

27:46.109 --> 27:52.819
me up in my civilian, whatever it is. Was there 
anything in your military career that you

27:54.065 --> 28:08.645
thought, well, maybe I could have done a better job 
on that, or maybe I just sort of, I mean, I just, I

27:54.065 --> 28:08.645
wish, when you think back, you said, well, that you 
might say, well, I wish, you know, that was sort of a

27:54.065 --> 28:08.645
shortcoming on my part. Maybe I could have done 
more there. Was there anything like that? Never.

28:11.830 --> 28:13.592
You always felt that you were giving 100%? I always 
felt that I was giving everything that was

28:13.632 --> 28:17.218
required of me. Okay, okay. You know, a lot of, 
young core kids today talk about leadership and in

28:20.069 --> 28:26.816
order to become a general you have to have some kind 
of a leadership potential. You've got to deliver

28:26.996 --> 28:29.059
your job that they give you. You've got to be able to 
subordinate. I mean, delegate. Supervise.

28:40.171 --> 28:41.392
Subordinate. Be patient.

28:45.116 --> 28:47.038
Psychoanalyze people. Put yourself in their 
shoes. What would you do? Okay, so I want to know how

28:52.393 --> 28:55.538
you define leadership, in other words. You're 
obviously a general and a leader, so if you had to go

28:56.459 --> 29:05.052
to Aggieland and give a talk to a bunch of corpsmen 
on leadership, how would you define it? What would

29:05.072 --> 29:07.496
you tell them? Well, the quality of leadership is 
having first integrity. Mm-hmm, mm-hmm. And

29:13.565 --> 29:17.370
having confidence in what you're talking about 
and knowing your subject, know what you're

29:13.565 --> 29:17.370
talking about. Mm-hmm. And remember, I was scared 
to death when I was in front of a platoon as a second

29:18.659 --> 29:31.931
lieutenant because I was afraid somebody in that 
platoon was a graduate of the University of

29:18.659 --> 29:31.931
Minnesota with magna cum laude and knew more than I 
did. So therefore, I was scared of my subject. I had

29:34.273 --> 29:40.239
to be, in my own mind, I had to prepare myself to do 
what I was supposed to do. So preparation comes in

29:42.140 --> 29:44.342
all that. And everything. It's just not just 
happens. And determination. Okay.

29:54.207 --> 29:55.949
And I gave you all that there with the Marines. I 
gave you that thing right over there, resources,

29:56.009 --> 29:59.953
all that kind of business. The Marines got to learn 
how to shoot. Something like that. Yeah, I see

30:03.377 --> 30:04.037
that. I have this thing right here. Which he wrote. 
You can send it back to me. There it is. Patriotism

30:15.393 --> 30:27.663
and loyal, discipline, self-respect and pride, 
alertness, spiritual cheerfulness,

30:15.393 --> 30:27.663
enthusiasm, initiative, resourcefulness. You 
can't use that typewriter. You can use a pen.

30:31.246 --> 30:34.709
Aggressiveness, determination and tenacity. 
Stick to a thing. The best shot in the world, of

30:37.992 --> 30:39.734
course. Privilege and honor of being a Marine. But 
these other things in the middle there are things

30:41.815 --> 30:44.978
that bring all this thing up. a clean mind, a clean 
body, and deliver the message to Garcia. You ever

30:51.156 --> 30:52.379
heard of that before? During the 
Spanish-American War, they gave this ensign this

30:54.424 --> 31:03.123
job to deliver this message, and he killed people, 
but he delivered the message to Garcia. Get the job

31:03.864 --> 31:05.548
done. These are all the things in here to bring me to 
shift. Okay, did you have all these values? Well,

31:11.651 --> 31:15.575
now that we have it on tape, you can keep it. Did we 
have all these... Did you, as a leader, did you have

31:15.675 --> 31:20.700
all those values, do you think? I think I tried to. 
Okay, okay. I aspired to them. Ain't nobody

31:24.524 --> 31:25.725
perfect. Right, right,

31:25.745 --> 31:29.429
right. See? So... There you are. The only thing is 
that... I say the only thing... Maybe some other

31:37.709 --> 31:41.213
time we'll get all these pictures together for 
you. Okay. You know, there's different types of

31:42.215 --> 31:45.559
leaders, General. I know that. There are leaders 
who think that go out using a lot of obscenity,

31:47.301 --> 31:55.111
we'll put it around you. That only makes the troops 
know you don't know what the hell you're doing.

31:58.976 --> 31:59.817
You're showing off.

32:02.640 --> 32:03.902
Well, what about, you know, In the military, 
there's sort of the General Patton type, who's a

32:04.523 --> 32:10.048
tough guy, and there's sort of... I believe in him. 
And there's sort of the Eisenhower type, who's

32:10.989 --> 32:16.815
more of one who works for cooperation. What kind of 
leader were you, and which one did you like the

32:16.835 --> 32:19.958
most? I liked Patton.

32:25.123 --> 32:28.486
Because he believed in training. Okay. And he 
believed also... If something's got to be done,

32:31.793 --> 32:34.638
you got to do it, whether you like it or not.

32:38.725 --> 32:45.075
Then on top of that, I looked at the background of 
Patton.

32:48.140 --> 32:58.257
Patton said...

32:48.140 --> 32:58.257
You can have that.

33:02.827 --> 33:04.697
And here is some more. I will give you that some 
other time.

33:36.391 --> 33:40.756
When was this given to General Larson? During the 
time when it passed to me. You can have it. I've got

33:46.283 --> 33:48.345
plenty of them. So this is like 1945? Yeah. You've

33:50.287 --> 34:03.883
got to have confidence.

34:07.070 --> 34:13.738
Did you know that I shouldn't tell you this, but 
there's one guy that said I could have been

34:07.070 --> 34:13.738
president of A&M College. You know who that was? 
Caesar Augusta Hone, the guy who wrote The

34:15.480 --> 34:18.724
Dutchman on the Brazzers. You ever read it? No, I 
haven't read it, but I've heard of it, yeah. That's

34:23.190 --> 34:24.411
how much he thought of me. I lived in a tent right in 
front of his where he had his candy shop in his

34:25.533 --> 34:30.359
trunk. He and old Dixon. Did you want it? Who? I 
never thought, my god, I never thought I'd be

34:34.901 --> 34:39.890
capable of being president of the A&M College. But 
Judge Holman thought it after I got to be a lawyer. I

34:42.194 --> 34:44.779
wasn't no great John Marshall or anything like 
that. I guess, you know, I took, I took the, I took

34:44.799 --> 34:57.681
the law as something that I needed to help hold on 
what I could get, the holding life perhaps, you

34:44.799 --> 34:57.681
know. I never aspired to be a big corporation 
lawyer or anything like this, nothing like that.

35:06.503 --> 35:11.008
But I helped a lot of people acquire homes, because 
we represented the mortgage loan people. And I got

35:13.471 --> 35:20.099
a lot of contractors mad at me, too, because when 
they'd come up there and say they were going to do

35:13.471 --> 35:20.099
something for so much money, I knew damn well they 
couldn't do it. And then in the end, you wind up with

35:21.040 --> 35:28.309
a lien, and a this, and a that, and the other, and a 
lawsuit.

35:29.217 --> 35:32.460
The best way to have a lawsuit is compromise. Don't 
have any lawsuits.

35:37.305 --> 35:39.788
That's why I want to tell you this. My brother blew 
his brains out on it. He wouldn't listen to what I

35:41.249 --> 35:42.991
was talking about. We owned props from Woodhead to 
Hazard, North Boulevard, Bissonette, and South

35:43.011 --> 35:49.457
Boulevard, and he wouldn't listen to them. And all 
he had to do was compromise and give the Salmon

35:50.258 --> 35:57.525
Hospital estate $2,500 for 50 by 200 feet on Hazard 
Street and it would have been all over. But in the

35:57.866 --> 35:59.207
end, no, he wouldn't do it. He said I didn't know 
what I was talking about. He's 18 years older than I

36:01.660 --> 36:03.422
am. There's a picture over there and he finally in 
the end we lost and he blew his brains out. So you see

36:08.869 --> 36:10.751
I've had all I've had so much. Anyhow

36:13.394 --> 36:17.920
I don't know I don't want to wear you out. I don't 
want to wear you out. Well I wanted to ask you just

36:19.542 --> 36:21.644
one more thing. All right. And that deals with

36:28.195 --> 36:37.429
It deals with the changes that have taken place at 
A&M over the last, well, since General Rudder,

36:28.195 --> 36:37.429
okay? And I wanted, I'm sure that you know General 
Rudder, our new General Rudder, and what do you

36:37.449 --> 36:44.760
think of those changes? You know, A&M no longer has 
mandatory corps, and now it has women, and now it

36:44.780 --> 36:52.392
has blacks, and it's gone from 6,000 to 34,000. 
What do you think of all those changes? Well, the

36:53.894 --> 36:55.857
first thing I think that the, About the Corps, I 
want to get in on that. I think that they've

36:59.139 --> 37:07.652
bastardized the Smith-Lever Act, the Howell Act, 
the Marl Act, because it said they should teach

36:59.139 --> 37:07.652
military science and tactics. That's why you got a 
land grant. I understand that we couldn't put

37:12.278 --> 37:23.355
people back in the Corps after World War I, World 
War II, Korea, and Vietnam when they'd already had

37:12.278 --> 37:23.355
the service. Mm-hmm. But you still had to obligate 
them to military science and tactics and training

37:24.659 --> 37:30.006
for at least two years.

37:33.992 --> 37:36.916
And they should have held to that, regardless. 
Regardless. Now, I know why. Mothers commenced

37:41.041 --> 37:44.366
losing their sons in the this and the that and the 
other. And if they didn't get the girls in there,

37:44.787 --> 37:49.213
they wasn't going to have their appropriations. 
If they didn't put the blacks in there, you'd be

37:49.233 --> 37:53.198
violating the Civil Rights Act.

37:57.532 --> 37:59.053
So history changes everything. So did you think it 
was a good idea to have the women and the blacks?

38:04.518 --> 38:05.579
What do you think? What's your opinion? You 
couldn't stop that. You couldn't stop the black

38:09.703 --> 38:11.224
part of it. The women part, you couldn't stop that 
either because of the changing times. Okay.

38:18.510 --> 38:20.973
Changing times. Not like old Mr. Smith said, the 
great benefactor who gives this Aggie... the

38:27.822 --> 38:34.148
Solar Rolls reunion last night, he's got it 
perpetuated, financed forever. He hadn't got, he

38:35.410 --> 38:41.816
said all A&M needed was a football team, a band, and 
a cadet corps. But he had to give up with the women

38:43.358 --> 38:46.541
part and all that. I still believe that, but I know 
that the school game couldn't grow. And so you

38:52.167 --> 38:54.149
thought that growth was good for it? I don't think, 
I think it's something that had to be. Oh, okay. It

38:57.944 --> 39:01.308
had to be, it had to come to pass. On a changing time, 
women's rights, and all of that.

39:08.777 --> 39:15.384
And on top of that, showing the grades that these 
women make, some of these women make better grades

39:08.777 --> 39:15.384
than men. And on top of that, on some of the jobs 
they're getting, which I hear at the A&M Club,

39:17.166 --> 39:24.475
industrial work, and this, that, and the other.

39:27.965 --> 39:35.313
But the only thing I have got to gripe at A&M College 
is about one thing, that every male should have two

39:27.965 --> 39:35.313
years of military training. That's it. That's the 
only gripe I have. I don't say about the women. I've

39:43.142 --> 39:44.404
got a gripe on that. I say they're bastardizing the 
Smith-Cleaver Act. And I know why they're doing

39:47.267 --> 39:50.150
it, on politics.

39:52.293 --> 39:54.015
A lot of times people don't want to send a kid to A&M. 
They're probably going to send him to war and get

39:54.055 --> 39:56.217
him killed. Well, everybody owes the obligation. 
I made a speech. Is this on tape? I made a speech at

40:02.850 --> 40:10.281
the Chamber of Commerce on the Marine Corps 
birthday several years ago in Pasadena. And when I

40:11.142 --> 40:18.272
got through telling them about the history of the 
Marine Corps and what we celebrate today for and so

40:11.142 --> 40:18.272
forth and so on, the birthday of the Marine Corps, 
from the early days until now, and I wound up my

40:18.809 --> 40:34.993
speech by saying the only difference between a 
person in the Army, Navy, Coast Guard, Health

40:18.809 --> 40:34.993
Corps, is that a Marine is trained to meet God most 
any time. And this kid here, who was killed the

40:35.995 --> 40:42.304
other day, he knew he wasn't scared to die. He was 
not scared to die. That's a different Marine Corps

40:48.560 --> 40:50.362
than the rest of them. We're trained to die. They 
told us that's our job. And as fast as one Marine

40:55.049 --> 40:57.692
goes, a Marine never dies. Another one comes in his 
place. And the same hats and faces you see there in

40:59.635 --> 41:11.551
1917, I looked out there in the division in 1940, 
and I saw the same faces as the sons of the same

40:59.635 --> 41:11.551
faces. Another generation. Yes. But at A&M 
College, of course, I think that I won. I think

41:21.474 --> 41:23.697
A&M's had great presidents. I think Dr. Williams, 
who was a battalion commander, who made three

41:23.737 --> 41:33.048
assault landings, who don't brag about it, he made 
you one of your fine presidents. I think Rutter

41:33.869 --> 41:35.572
made a fine president. I think a man that be 
president of A&M College should have some

41:35.652 --> 41:42.520
military background.

41:42.540 --> 41:44.663
See? I can't help what discipline they want. and 
all like that. But I had a friend of mine named

41:48.965 --> 41:50.587
General Chase. But when I found out what his 
discipline was on political science, I never

41:51.327 --> 41:57.574
even... They gave me the courage to recommend the 
president, but that, you know, didn't mean

41:57.895 --> 42:02.780
anything. But the proof of the pudding is in the 
eating. The proof of the discipline of the Marine

42:09.568 --> 42:15.975
Corps is the efficiency And how we have to always go 
with less because we have fought and jealous of by

42:16.850 --> 42:22.657
the other service. So we have to get out there and 
compete and do better than the rest of the people.

42:27.803 --> 42:30.325
So it is A&M College now. These kids who go to 
school, they realize they can't mess off. They

42:34.951 --> 42:35.992
can't screw around. They got to get to work. And if 
they don't produce when they get on a job, they

42:38.635 --> 42:43.120
ain't gonna hold that job because they don't hold 
them on that diploma. It only holds on what you can

42:43.520 --> 42:45.743
produce. And if you don't produce anything, he and 
them collars get the black eye.

42:54.209 --> 43:09.108
Speaking about other services, before I asked you 
and you said you'd talk about this, the difference

42:54.209 --> 43:09.108
between Annapolis officers, Aggie officers, 
West Point officers, would you tell me the

42:54.209 --> 43:09.108
difference? I prefer Aggie officers in my book. 
And why is that? Because I have served with them.

43:18.712 --> 43:19.152
They're good. They're all good. They're all good. 
The Naval officers graduated from Minneapolis.

43:27.482 --> 43:29.084
They've got the eight balls, too. And after every 
war, you see them retire. A bunch of those people

43:33.649 --> 43:35.171
have been in the Navy. They graduated Naval 
Academy. Armand Simpson, who's at A&M, was

43:38.695 --> 43:44.181
sitting on the porch with me In Samoa, when he said 
he'd just heard from Marge and that Dr. Walton was

43:44.802 --> 43:53.975
not there anymore and he'd lost his job, I said, 
Armand, I'm older than you are. I'm going to tell

43:53.995 --> 43:55.897
you what happened after World War I. They fooled 
around and found all these people who were

43:57.199 --> 44:11.098
reservists and things like that, and they found 
they were competent, and they outshored a regular

43:57.199 --> 44:11.098
officer, and they retired the regular officer, 
and they put that reserve officer in the job, and

43:57.199 --> 44:11.098
that's what happened. The next day he was ordered 
to MacArthur staff, and look at him today.

44:15.734 --> 44:19.618
Armand's a good friend of mine, personal friend of 
mine. That's the way it is. So I have no prejudice.

44:22.001 --> 44:24.583
Some of them are good, some of them I have no 
prejudice. But I do object to having a clique of

44:24.924 --> 44:33.092
people from Annapolis to pass on things, to pass 
favors on to a guy because he's from Annapolis. I

44:33.112 --> 44:37.797
believe in passing on, doing only on ability and 
performance.

44:40.480 --> 44:44.104
I knew a Marine officer who had a fine World War I 
record. He had a fine record in the West Indies, in

44:44.995 --> 44:54.665
Nicaragua, Haiti, San Domingo.

44:57.488 --> 45:01.632
But he was living World War I all the time, and he was 
this, that, and the other. And then the 6th

45:02.253 --> 45:14.125
Marines, they gave him a regiment, and he called 
for fire on the wrong side, and he got about 8, 10

45:02.253 --> 45:14.125
Marines killed, and General Shepard relieved him 
immediately, although he had fought. in Belleau

45:15.320 --> 45:18.304
Wood with General Shepard. That's beneficial.

45:25.255 --> 45:25.375
Right. I've seen all these things happen. And I've 
seen right after World War II, they commenced. I

45:31.204 --> 45:37.513
had one of them eight balls as a battalion 
commander on Guam, and all of a sudden trying to

45:31.204 --> 45:37.513
impress me that he was a graduate of Fort Monmouth, 
New Jersey, and so forth, the communications guy.

45:43.295 --> 45:45.737
I said, well, just get communication on the 
battalion. All I want is you keep your battalion in

45:45.817 --> 45:49.020
communication with my headquarters. That's all. 
And every Monday and Tuesday he'd come to me. I

45:51.983 --> 45:55.427
said, please, go ahead on. As soon as the war was 
over, they bust some lieutenant colonels, a

45:55.447 --> 45:58.089
major. Out he went. Another time, that same 
officer was out in Samoa. And the raiders were

46:04.257 --> 46:16.271
about ready to leave, and I went out there and I had 
to investigate a matter where they stole some

46:04.257 --> 46:16.271
rifles from the 22nd Marines, which was commanded 
by an Aggie, Johnny Walker. About the rifles they

46:17.312 --> 46:23.099
stole, and I went out there, and hey, this 
officer's sitting there sleeping. I said, why in

46:23.119 --> 46:25.542
the hell ain't you out with Colonel Liver said? Oh, 
he says, I'm the exec. See, he was a man with a

46:29.427 --> 46:34.112
pistol, he was a man with a quirk, and he was a man 
just sitting there. That's that same meeting. He

46:37.864 --> 46:40.548
comes to me as a lieutenant colonel, commanding. 
Anyhow, so I told Liversedge that night, he and I

46:41.790 --> 46:46.537
were good friends. I said, God damn. I said, I went 
out there to your exec. I said, as far as I'm

46:52.145 --> 46:55.429
concerned, I'm going to tell you now. I forgot 
about this affair, all those raffles out of the

46:56.191 --> 47:00.577
22nd Marines. I'm going to put in a negative 
report. I know you goddamn men got those rifles.

47:06.750 --> 47:11.676
Those kids over there just brought some extra 
rifles along with them, that's all. I said, you

47:12.076 --> 47:14.379
better get rid of that damn exec you got. You're 
going to get yourself killed and everybody else.

47:17.523 --> 47:20.406
He said, don't worry, I'm going to get rid of that 
son of a bitch as soon as I get to Normia. And he did.

47:21.327 --> 47:24.410
And I'll get him laid on as a battalion commander. 
Tell me anyway. I've had the experience. I know

47:26.172 --> 47:30.137
what I'm talking about.
