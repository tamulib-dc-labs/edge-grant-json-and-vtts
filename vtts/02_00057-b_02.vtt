00:02.950 --> 00:09.620
I think of my friends and the ones that I knew pretty well, but it was kind of a combination, but I would say more of them were for some small.

00:10.301 --> 00:24.443
When I gave up basketball and moved over to the quad and joined Squadron 11 over there, the guys that I remember, a lot of them were from rural areas, small towns, but all around.

00:24.663 --> 00:28.549
I met one or two from out of state, but, you know, that was kind of the exception.

00:28.569 --> 00:30.612
Blue collar, white collar?

00:32.819 --> 00:54.286
I would say a lot, again, most of these small town folks, I don't know if you'd call them blue collar, but they weren't from upper class, economically anyways, upper class families, good people, but some of them were from farms and ranches and some of them were pretty well fixed too, I know that.

00:55.007 --> 00:58.692
Clayton Williams was a classmate of mine and I never will forget.

00:59.718 --> 01:01.842
When we came here, they registered.

01:01.922 --> 01:03.205
We were all the ag guys.

01:03.265 --> 01:09.416
They give you a block schedule as the first year freshman, as a first semester freshman.

01:09.436 --> 01:11.781
We got, we were in the block of students.

01:12.482 --> 01:14.366
And you had the same schedule that they did.

01:15.047 --> 01:17.111
Well, I was in the same block with Clayton Williams.

01:17.912 --> 01:20.477
And I remember we took Math 101 together.

01:21.335 --> 01:25.161
And, you know, this guy, I remember him very well.

01:26.503 --> 01:30.890
He'd sit there and he'd ask the dumbest questions I've ever heard.

01:31.451 --> 01:32.352
But I figured it out.

01:32.412 --> 01:37.119
Clayton that did this, he was clever the way he would do this.

01:39.623 --> 01:42.027
But he could...

01:42.884 --> 01:50.215
get his point across and he'd make a point in the class asking, you know, what appeared to be a pretty dumb question.

01:50.655 --> 01:59.208
I say dumb, that's not the right word, but he was quick to ask a question and kind of pretend like he didn't know it.

01:59.228 --> 02:02.893
He was a lot smarter than he pretended, I thought.

02:04.015 --> 02:10.765
Good sharp guy, but I did have, I had a block schedule with Clayton and we've been friends since then.

02:10.947 --> 02:14.831
Were you all aware of his father's ranching interest?

02:15.211 --> 02:15.271
No.

02:15.291 --> 02:17.353
I knew that he was from ranching background.

02:17.373 --> 02:28.764
That's what kind of led me to this, that, you know, there were some of these kids that may have been from small rural places, but they had pretty good farms and ranches back there.

02:29.184 --> 02:33.208
What was the general attitude about work in those days?

02:33.228 --> 02:36.571
Oh, I think, you know, everybody accepted it pretty well.

02:36.651 --> 02:39.334
It was a strong work ethic.

02:40.040 --> 02:44.363
I didn't get to really finish that question you asked me about the general attitude and all.

02:44.484 --> 02:48.143
I'm sorry I didn't, I kind of got straight off there.

02:49.473 --> 02:55.719
You know, it varied, but again, a lot of them from small towns.

02:55.999 --> 02:57.200
Of course, I was in ag.

02:57.260 --> 02:59.262
Now, that's another thing that influenced me.

02:59.642 --> 03:11.913
See, I wasn't over there with the engineers and all to start with, but my contacts were ag guys and farm boys mainly because that's where my schedule was and who I saw in class and got to know better.

03:12.353 --> 03:15.316
So that may be a little bit off the mark.

03:15.336 --> 03:18.619
But most of them,

03:18.599 --> 03:20.782
or were there some Hispanics?

03:20.802 --> 03:21.843
There were some Hispanics.

03:21.943 --> 03:28.171
I roomed with a Hispanic, a fellow from Brownsville.

03:29.593 --> 03:33.197
And how was he and the other Hispanics, how were they treated in that era?

03:33.898 --> 03:35.800
I don't remember any problem whatsoever.

03:37.102 --> 03:39.645
You know, we didn't think about them being

03:39.878 --> 03:43.944
another ethnic or nationality, and we just didn't, you know, it never occurred to me.

03:44.484 --> 03:51.214
We, we, they were fully accepted, and I don't remember any problem at all from that standpoint.

03:51.234 --> 03:53.877
He just had a Hispanic-sounding name is all I knew.

03:53.937 --> 04:06.474
This one fellow that was my roommate there one semester in our hall, I guess it was a spring semester, but he waited tables in the dining hall.

04:06.554 --> 04:08.417
I remember that up at Cebisa.

04:08.971 --> 04:13.838
And he was not a very good student and didn't seem too committed to college.

04:14.919 --> 04:20.967
And on Saturday night, he'd have these poker games in the room.

04:21.027 --> 04:28.558
He'd invite some of his friends in, and they'd play poker until Sunday morning breakfast time.

04:29.719 --> 04:31.742
I mean, play all night long.

04:33.624 --> 04:34.746
And a lot of them smoked.

04:34.766 --> 04:36.328
That was another thing.

04:36.967 --> 04:39.770
Seemed like everybody got into smoking pretty quickly.

04:39.850 --> 04:46.817
The pressure and the stress of college and something about being more mature and all, a lot of people took up smoking.

04:47.618 --> 04:54.244
But they were smoking and, you know, I'd, about midnight or one o'clock, I'd crawl up in the rack, try to go to sleep on Saturday night.

04:54.344 --> 04:56.506
We didn't have any study hall or anything then.

04:56.607 --> 04:59.610
But they'd play that, play poker all night.

04:59.710 --> 05:06.096
But, you know, I think he posted about a zero-zero and end of the semester he was gone.

05:06.177 --> 05:29.080
the let's see were there some catholics and protestants yes jewish i remember some of the religious uh organizations they all seem to have active groups and that was kind of interesting to me too because i'd come from a place where either baptist or methodist it seemed and you know i didn't know many others but uh here you know i saw

05:29.532 --> 05:32.256
people from all faiths.

05:32.356 --> 05:37.503
And I don't remember any problems, really, with that.

05:37.523 --> 05:40.527
Did you participate in any of the religious organizations?

05:40.767 --> 05:43.551
Well, I went to church over here at Northgate.

05:43.912 --> 05:45.153
Which one?

05:45.173 --> 05:46.595
The First Baptist Church over there.

05:47.296 --> 05:58.932
Describe that church, that congregation then, as you... As I remember it, it had a lot of college kids there and a lot of university-related churches.

05:58.912 --> 05:59.693
Older people.

06:01.597 --> 06:04.262
Seemed like Cliff Randstill was there, one of them, I remember.

06:06.446 --> 06:10.694
But it was very college-oriented group.

06:10.974 --> 06:12.898
Did you go on Sunday night to the BSU?

06:13.258 --> 06:17.005
No, I didn't get involved with the BSU then.

06:18.267 --> 06:29.562
I don't know, I guess I just didn't feel that I had time then, but basketball was a long season in spring practice and we had those long practices.

06:29.642 --> 06:35.309
We'd go over, it seemed like we'd start suiting up about 5 or 5.30.

06:35.329 --> 06:46.283
No, before that I guess, but we would, during season, we'd have a two hour, two and a half hour practice.

06:46.550 --> 06:49.858
And we wouldn't eat during season.

06:49.938 --> 06:52.765
We would go to Sibisa and eat.

06:52.866 --> 06:54.991
I was eating on the training table, they called it.

06:56.334 --> 06:58.720
And I was over here special.

06:59.138 --> 07:03.283
And you got steaks and the best food that they could put out there.

07:03.884 --> 07:08.130
When you were on, when your sport was in season and you were on the training table.

07:08.170 --> 07:10.953
Now, we didn't do that except right during the actual season.

07:11.213 --> 07:17.462
Was there anything else that you were aware of that was done specially for athletes?

07:17.702 --> 07:21.226
Were there any special classes that you knew?

07:21.867 --> 07:21.927
No.

07:21.947 --> 07:22.929
Don't remember anything.

07:23.890 --> 07:25.652
The athletes were...

07:26.223 --> 07:28.447
of a different group, I would say, in those days.

07:28.487 --> 07:32.213
There were some guys in there that were brilliant, smart.

07:32.974 --> 07:34.316
I never will forget some of them.

07:34.717 --> 07:42.729
I remember the guys from El Campo, Glenn Lippman, Elo, Noavitsa, Yarrow and a Tardis.

07:43.230 --> 07:48.539
Three guys, class of 52, all came out of El Campo, all great football players.

07:48.619 --> 07:50.121
Glenn Lippman was

07:50.354 --> 08:15.012
one of the greatest in texas high school sports but they were all gerald notardis supposedly was a valedictorian in the class of 52. brilliant guy and you didn't hear anything about anybody slipping them any money or no the only thing i remember is if you were a varsity athlete a football player i believe you got two tickets

08:15.700 --> 08:18.783
And you could, some of them sold those tickets.

08:18.883 --> 08:26.972
Now, tickets were... Supposedly for their parents, but they can... But there were no rules I'm aware of that said you couldn't sell those tickets.

08:26.992 --> 08:30.756
But frankly, there was no huge demand for them in those days.

08:30.836 --> 08:34.039
So, you know, they weren't going to get any big value for them.

08:34.079 --> 08:37.283
But I think some of them did sell their tickets.

08:37.323 --> 08:39.245
But I believe they got, it's either two or four.

08:39.325 --> 08:40.025
Two, I believe.

08:40.586 --> 08:41.387
Two free tickets.

08:41.767 --> 08:43.429
And they lived in...

08:43.409 --> 08:44.675
in the Hart Hall.

08:44.916 --> 08:47.770
They lived down on kind of the south half of Hart Hall.

08:47.931 --> 08:50.905
And did they have big fancy new cars?

08:52.353 --> 08:53.275
I don't remember.

08:53.335 --> 08:56.621
Some of them had a car, but most of us did not have a car.

08:57.502 --> 09:01.871
Some did, but, you know, I can remember a lot of the football players.

09:01.911 --> 09:14.614
Now, there are one or two off the record here that I can say that, you know, were kind of bums, if you would, that didn't seem to have too high standards.

09:16.012 --> 09:22.140
You know, seemed to play pool all the time and, you know, but there were a few of those.

09:22.220 --> 09:29.949
But by and large, the athletes that I remember were good people, good students.

09:30.049 --> 09:31.691
I could just tick off a lot of them.

09:32.272 --> 09:34.575
Bobby Ragsdale, Reba's husband.

09:34.655 --> 09:38.740
Bobby was one class ahead of me, lived over there not far from me in Hart Hall.

09:39.401 --> 09:40.022
Good man.

09:40.502 --> 09:43.386
Ph.D.

09:44.581 --> 09:47.622
soil conservation work and all that.

09:48.530 --> 09:53.095
I could say Ralph Ellis, the swimmer, was Jude and Herring.

09:53.996 --> 09:56.438
I could go down a list.

09:56.518 --> 09:57.699
A bunch of them were good people.

09:57.719 --> 10:01.283
But even on the football team, there was a lot of good folks there.

10:01.964 --> 10:04.366
Charlie Sachs, the guy I know played in.

10:04.866 --> 10:07.529
He had a boy come through the Corps since I was here.

10:07.569 --> 10:10.792
But, you know, he's a veterinarian, I believe.

10:10.873 --> 10:13.335
But, you know, they went all directions.

10:15.337 --> 10:18.300
But I don't remember.

10:19.968 --> 10:23.932
It's just a totally different thing today than what it was then.

10:24.313 --> 10:32.882
And they didn't have professional sports that most of these folks are struggling and, you know, hardly anybody talked about going professional sports.

10:32.962 --> 10:35.144
Buddy Davis did go to basketball.

10:36.686 --> 10:39.469
But Yale Larry was a football player.

10:39.489 --> 10:42.792
He was a punter and a halfback and a baseball player.

10:44.294 --> 10:47.357
Yale played professionally, but not many of them did that.

10:47.437 --> 10:49.840
But like Darrell Hooper.

10:50.191 --> 10:50.812
shot putter.

10:50.852 --> 10:55.703
He set the records before Randy came here, but he was one of the most admired fellows we had.

10:56.244 --> 10:57.988
He married a little high school sweetheart.

10:58.028 --> 11:02.698
I think she's about 17 or 18, and boy, they were just a darling couple here on campus.

11:04.462 --> 11:10.275
But, you know, lots of good folks over there, in my opinion.

11:12.449 --> 11:23.080
The activities that pulled people together in those days, was Reveille, was the original Reveille still alive?

11:26.184 --> 11:27.065
I don't believe so.

11:27.785 --> 11:32.651
But the Reveille of that era you saw, that dog was around a lot?

11:33.251 --> 11:34.112
I don't remember it a lot.

11:34.372 --> 11:34.653
Really?

11:34.993 --> 11:38.777
I really don't.

11:39.095 --> 11:41.398
It's not the tradition that it is today.

11:41.779 --> 11:45.304
Did you, do you remember going to your first Silver Taps?

11:47.327 --> 11:54.738
Oh, I remember doing that the first time, but I don't, you know, I can't tell you exactly when it was.

11:54.938 --> 12:06.455
It was a, you know, I'd heard this tradition and it was something special and, of course, I lived right there close by where we had it and, you know, we always turned out the lights and went over there.

12:07.156 --> 12:08.899
Did everybody take it seriously?

12:09.183 --> 12:09.710
Uh,

12:13.047 --> 12:14.088
I would say so.

12:14.248 --> 12:21.075
I don't remember any problems or anyone questioning it, but I think it's become more entrenched over the years.

12:21.175 --> 12:26.300
It's better known, and a lot of these things were not all that well known.

12:26.400 --> 12:28.862
Elephant walk is a perfect example.

12:28.882 --> 12:31.184
We thought that was the most ridiculous thing we'd ever seen.

12:31.305 --> 12:40.033
I didn't go out there and do all that dancing around, but I really hadn't heard much about it, and there was really not much priority thought about it.

12:40.013 --> 12:46.402
And just whatever day it was, they'd get out there and kind of snake around a little bit, but it didn't amount to anything.

12:46.522 --> 12:50.387
A couple of parents asked me the other day, where did it originate?

12:51.048 --> 12:52.651
And I said, I have no idea.

12:52.671 --> 12:53.712
Why did it originate?

12:53.772 --> 12:55.094
I said, I have no idea.

12:55.114 --> 12:58.178
I said, I think some students just kind of thought it up.

12:58.198 --> 13:02.224
But Silver Taps, during your era, was held...

13:02.440 --> 13:04.562
about where it is today, is that right?

13:04.582 --> 13:06.124
I believe it, that's what I remember.

13:06.725 --> 13:11.970
And as far as you recall, when Silver Taps was over, people silently went back to their room?

13:12.191 --> 13:12.371
Yes.

13:13.953 --> 13:18.638
But, you know, we didn't have nearly as many students then, and Silver Taps was more of a special thing.

13:18.698 --> 13:21.040
Now, nowadays, you know, it's every month, it seems.

13:21.421 --> 13:26.166
But, you know, it was kind of a rare occasion in those days.

13:26.386 --> 13:29.369
Do you remember muster during your student day?

13:29.690 --> 13:29.830
Mm-hmm.

13:29.850 --> 13:31.772
Where was it held?

13:34.030 --> 13:35.031
Steps of the Y?

13:35.532 --> 13:39.457
I believe so, yes.

13:39.477 --> 13:43.281
You know, we didn't have any read or read or anything close to that in those days.

13:44.122 --> 13:56.217
I believe it was on the Y, at the Y. In your student days, did some World War II veterans occasionally show up on campus and talk about what it had been like in Europe or Bataan?

13:56.517 --> 14:02.164
Did y'all hear many World War II stories from ags?

14:05.485 --> 14:07.770
I don't remember much of that.

14:08.251 --> 14:11.378
And then when the Korean War is over, you're about to leave, so.

14:12.901 --> 14:16.869
You know, there were a good many World War II students on campus then.

14:17.651 --> 14:20.457
But, you know, we didn't have a lot of contact with them.

14:21.112 --> 14:24.096
We just didn't cross paths that much.

14:24.336 --> 14:28.823
And they weren't old enough yet to start reminiscing as much as they were.

14:28.843 --> 14:30.705
I just don't remember much of that.

14:30.745 --> 14:35.512
Not that, you know, through our military science classes and all, I'm sure we heard stories.

14:35.552 --> 14:39.617
I know we did, but I don't remember much of that.

14:39.878 --> 14:45.145
As far as you were aware, the most prestigious student leadership positions were what?

14:45.293 --> 14:50.866
If you could have held any position on campus as a student, what would have been the top task?

14:54.394 --> 14:54.996
Corps commander?

14:55.818 --> 14:56.379
Absolutely.

14:57.863 --> 14:59.286
That was the one position that

15:00.818 --> 15:03.462
that we held in highest esteem.

15:03.482 --> 15:14.761
There's no question in my mind, but, you know, I'm over here in this thing and I'm, you know, my time is so consumed that I didn't have time to do some of these other things.

15:15.442 --> 15:23.535
As far as you and your buddies were aware, was the Corps commander selected in a fair...

15:23.515 --> 15:27.101
You know, I didn't even know how he was selected, to be honest with you.

15:27.121 --> 15:27.782
I didn't know.

15:27.802 --> 15:34.012
I know those fellows during my time, and, you know, I still know them today very well.

15:35.735 --> 15:42.807
You know, people that I think were excellent role models and did a good job in the Corps.

15:43.445 --> 15:49.799
You know, Fred Mitchell was the Corps commander in my senior year, and, you know, I've visited with Fred a number of times.

15:49.939 --> 15:54.570
I've had him over here some, and I've heard him explain how he got selected.

15:54.630 --> 15:57.255
It was kind of a tight thing between him and somebody else.

15:57.275 --> 16:01.605
He explained to me, you know, and they finally had the vote.

16:03.408 --> 16:05.151
You know, as a cadet, we don't know that.

16:05.191 --> 16:07.995
You go down here today, a lot of these cadets can't tell you.

16:08.376 --> 16:13.824
I have a grandniece that's going to be a senior in the Corps this year, and she's my feedback.

16:14.465 --> 16:17.450
And it's so interesting, and I learned that when I was commandant.

16:17.470 --> 16:21.957
You sit down with these kids and just listen, you can learn more stuff.

16:21.937 --> 16:49.395
but it's interesting how little they know about certain things and how rumors spread and they're so misled about certain things about things that are going to happen and what did happen a lot of times they're totally off base but they're occupied with their studies and surviving in their little world and they all know all these things but i i can't tell you how they were selected then i assumed it was all fair and the head bull probably blessed that and uh

16:49.595 --> 17:00.971
But, you know, we never, I don't know anyone that expressed any doubts about these folks, whether they were qualified or unhappy that they were put in the job, but it was a very respected job.

17:01.071 --> 17:02.433
And then yell leaders?

17:02.754 --> 17:07.941
Yell leaders was a very visible, very... What did you and your buddies think about the band?

17:09.001 --> 17:16.413
Oh, there was always that little put down of the band, friendly rivalry and stuff.

17:16.433 --> 17:19.978
You know, that's continued on and gotten worse, if anything, I think.

17:20.259 --> 17:24.105
Was there even a student body president in that era?

17:24.445 --> 17:25.267
Yes, there was.

17:25.707 --> 17:28.111
They had a, well, I say student body, I don't know.

17:28.151 --> 17:29.353
Maybe we didn't.

17:29.874 --> 17:31.076
We had class officers.

17:31.376 --> 17:33.239
I don't remember a student body president.

17:33.840 --> 17:35.683
I remember class officers.

17:35.782 --> 17:46.095
I remember who some of them were, you know, in my time, but I don't believe, well, I could be wrong, but I can't remember a student body president.

17:46.996 --> 17:54.345
You know, the student senate would come along, and some folks got into that pretty good.

17:54.405 --> 17:56.107
We had the hometown clubs in.

17:56.187 --> 17:59.411
That was a strong... Did you all have an Abilene club?

17:59.511 --> 18:00.112
Absolutely.

18:00.292 --> 18:02.174
What was the purpose of the Abilene club?

18:02.335 --> 18:04.337
Well, it's just...

18:05.920 --> 18:15.711
kind of give you a group that you have some common bond with that you can get together and feel comfortable and kind of help as a freshman particularly.

18:16.282 --> 18:19.026
You know, your Abilene buddies are going to be nice to you.

18:19.727 --> 18:20.188
And they were.

18:20.769 --> 18:22.412
And also to get rides home.

18:22.952 --> 18:25.036
To help coordinate things like that.

18:25.637 --> 18:27.339
It's just a little network there.

18:27.399 --> 18:30.524
But, you know, we didn't do anything a whole lot together.

18:30.845 --> 18:33.329
But, you know, our pictures were big time in the annuals.

18:33.369 --> 18:34.270
You go back and look.

18:34.290 --> 18:37.535
And hometown clubs were pretty important in those days.

18:37.996 --> 18:40.720
And there was a link with mother's clubs and all that.

18:40.700 --> 18:45.185
And I've always assumed it was another place to turn if you needed help.

18:45.326 --> 18:45.586
Yes.

18:46.106 --> 18:51.413
Advice or money or whatever, you might turn to somebody that could be of assistance.

18:51.613 --> 18:57.320
I would say that that hometown club was a comfort zone for you, especially the first year or two.

18:58.061 --> 19:02.286
Were you and your buddies aware of the existence of secret fraternities?

19:05.890 --> 19:09.154
You know, my senior year, 54,

19:09.640 --> 19:14.712
There was a little flare up there toward the end and I never understood all of that.

19:15.594 --> 19:21.388
And some of my buddies in my class were dismissed and weren't commissioned initially and all because of

19:21.824 --> 19:23.667
Secret fraternities.

19:24.588 --> 19:27.813
And, you know, I heard about it, the TTs and all this.

19:27.833 --> 19:31.218
I used to hear little stories around the quad and all.

19:31.238 --> 19:34.342
And, you know, I never knew if that was true or not.

19:35.985 --> 19:41.954
So I really didn't know a whole lot, but I've gone back and checked a lot of that since I came back to A&M.

19:42.034 --> 19:46.881
And most of the history happened right as I was leaving and just after I was leaving.

19:47.762 --> 19:50.346
So I was gone and wasn't...

19:51.085 --> 19:53.749
that familiar with some of the things that were going on.

19:53.849 --> 19:58.176
What about tunnels?

19:58.276 --> 20:01.000
Did you ever go into a steam tunnel?

20:01.241 --> 20:02.302
I never went in one.

20:02.322 --> 20:04.205
I heard a lot of stories about them.

20:04.225 --> 20:05.487
I heard a lot of stories about them.

20:05.507 --> 20:06.869
Like, you know, it was a great secret.

20:08.171 --> 20:13.279
I could talk a little bit perhaps off the record about the fraternities and all here.

20:13.529 --> 20:21.438
I didn't think maybe we, I didn't want to get pinned down too much on any of this.

20:21.578 --> 20:25.723
When you were an undergraduate here, what were the student indulgences?

20:25.803 --> 20:29.708
What did students eat, drink, smoke, and so forth?

20:37.336 --> 20:40.220
Well... There were beer parties, weren't there?

20:40.240 --> 20:41.101
There, absolutely.

20:41.301 --> 20:41.561
Where?

20:41.721 --> 20:43.063
They had them...

20:43.313 --> 20:44.914
Out at the pits.

20:45.035 --> 20:45.915
See, what do they call them?

20:45.935 --> 20:47.397
The clay pits, I believe it was.

20:47.937 --> 20:53.883
They had the outfit beer parties and units and groups that have parties at the clay pits.

20:55.024 --> 20:56.205
I believe that's what they called them.

20:56.225 --> 20:58.507
But there were a lot of those, but they'd go off campus.

20:58.607 --> 21:05.413
I don't remember, you know, drinking in the dorms and all that back in those days.

21:05.433 --> 21:08.056
It may have been against the rules then to drink on campus.

21:08.456 --> 21:09.357
I just don't remember it.

21:09.377 --> 21:12.780
When I came back to A&M, I was a little shocked to see that

21:13.013 --> 21:17.260
hey, you know, these folks got, if you're of age, you can have it in your dorms.

21:17.400 --> 21:26.476
Did, in your day, did, as far as you were aware, did folks hide beer or whiskey in the room?

21:26.496 --> 21:29.802
I'm sure they did some, but I didn't see much of that.

21:30.443 --> 21:37.755
Where were the places around in the campus neighborhood where students could go and drink?

21:38.377 --> 21:39.638
Was Uncle Ed still going?

21:40.339 --> 21:40.600
Hard liquors?

21:40.660 --> 21:41.561
I don't remember.

21:41.581 --> 21:42.582
Hard liquors, yeah.

21:43.984 --> 21:44.885
Down the Welburn Road.

21:45.005 --> 21:45.345
Yes.

21:46.066 --> 21:49.270
Brenham was a place a lot of people talked about going.

21:49.290 --> 21:51.152
Of course, they had the— Whiskey Bridge.

21:51.332 --> 21:52.273
Whiskey Bridge.

21:52.694 --> 21:54.175
I hear them talk about that a lot.

21:55.557 --> 22:03.827
It seemed like, you know, we were a dry community then, as I recall, and, you know, it wasn't as easy to— For whiskey, I think it was.

22:03.887 --> 22:04.267
Yeah.

22:05.088 --> 22:06.730
And smoking, what did people smoke?

22:07.739 --> 22:11.064
Oh, Camels, Lucky Strikes, Chesterfield.

22:11.404 --> 22:14.388
And did people smoke in, they did smoke in their rooms?

22:15.369 --> 22:15.930
I believe so.

22:17.633 --> 22:19.375
Could a cadet... Oh, yes, they smoked in a room.

22:19.535 --> 22:23.180
I remember the party, the gambling all night, and they'd smoke.

22:23.521 --> 22:33.274
Could a cadet, under core regulations, could a cadet carry a pack of cigarettes in his shirt pocket when he was walking down the sidewalk?

22:34.368 --> 22:35.610
I don't remember seeing that.

22:36.532 --> 22:39.798
I guess not.

22:40.740 --> 22:43.044
I don't ever remember seeing that.

22:43.745 --> 22:48.094
And cigars were kind of a... Macho, manly thing.

22:48.114 --> 22:48.775
A special.

22:49.296 --> 22:51.360
Football games and special occasions.

22:52.341 --> 22:54.125
And did anybody smoke a pipe?

22:54.425 --> 22:55.347
Any students?

22:55.765 --> 23:00.329
Oh, I'm sure there might have been a few, but I don't recall.

23:00.789 --> 23:01.890
Chewing tobacco or snuff?

23:02.051 --> 23:03.272
Chewing tobacco or some of that.

23:03.992 --> 23:06.034
Maybe not as much as we see today.

23:07.315 --> 23:09.057
People carry that little can in their pocket.

23:09.257 --> 23:13.341
A lot of the farm boys and others, bonfire kids do that.

23:14.061 --> 23:18.845
Did you and your buddies even know the terminology of drugs?

23:19.466 --> 23:21.388
Did you know the word heroin?

23:22.429 --> 23:25.131
I'd heard of this term marijuana.

23:25.364 --> 23:29.831
And people, as a joke, said, man, he must have been smoking marijuana.

23:30.232 --> 23:32.015
And, you know, I didn't even know what that was.

23:33.256 --> 23:35.019
But I'd heard that term.

23:35.139 --> 23:37.764
But heroin, I can't say that I heard that term.

23:37.784 --> 23:39.446
Yeah, I sure hadn't in those years.

23:39.466 --> 23:42.531
But marijuana, you know, there was certainly no drug culture.

23:45.396 --> 23:52.587
And for you and your buddies, before you met this special young lady from Hamilton, where did you all get dates?

23:55.418 --> 23:58.844
Through friends.

23:59.365 --> 24:02.431
Some folks had dates up at TSCW.

24:02.491 --> 24:04.815
They, you know, that was the big story.

24:04.855 --> 24:14.913
They were kind of our sister school and, you know, if you really needed a date, well, you could probably figure out some way that somebody would help you get a date up at TSCW.

24:14.974 --> 24:18.540
Did you ever write a letter to a blind date up there?

24:18.520 --> 24:19.342
No.

24:19.362 --> 24:23.651
Because I've heard it was done by... I've heard of that, but I never did that.

24:25.214 --> 24:31.567
But a fair number of folks did strike up acquaintances with girls up at TSCW.

24:32.008 --> 24:38.301
When girls came here for a social event, an outfit dance or a ring dance, how were they treated?

24:40.019 --> 24:40.981
Oh, very well.

24:41.742 --> 24:42.623
Extremely well.

24:43.064 --> 24:44.386
They were very honored guests.

24:44.687 --> 24:47.552
But, you know, walking around here during the week, you didn't even see a girl.

24:48.193 --> 24:54.444
And one little hitchhike back on earlier question, you know, what was it, what are they thinking, attitudes and all of that.

24:57.389 --> 25:01.015
You know, a lot of the folks weren't very happy here.

25:01.315 --> 25:05.985
I think it was because it was an isolated place, no girls.

25:07.348 --> 25:09.774
They used to kind of talk about, man, it sure would be nice.

25:09.834 --> 25:11.598
We were over there at Dallas or Houston.

25:12.981 --> 25:18.092
But it's a big detraction.

25:18.494 --> 25:20.617
You just have all males like this.

25:22.620 --> 25:24.683
You just see girls on special occasions.

25:26.386 --> 25:40.688
People, you know, I don't hear it today, but back in those days, a lot of people seemed to be kind of critical of the environment.

25:41.647 --> 25:44.450
And maybe they were longing for what came along later.

25:45.331 --> 25:49.756
But now you and your buddies didn't talk about the admission of women as students, did you?

25:50.236 --> 25:50.597
No, never.

25:51.698 --> 25:53.560
You know, we just assumed this is the way it is.

25:53.640 --> 26:06.574
What did you and your friends, if you wanted to go out in the community for anything special, what did you all do for amusement on a Saturday night?

26:06.841 --> 26:11.026
Oh, go down to Bryan, go to the movie, or go over to Northgate and go to a movie.

26:11.586 --> 26:15.110
Maybe go get a hammer, go at the drive-in, the old Triangle drive-in up there.

26:15.130 --> 26:16.512
It was a big social place.

26:16.552 --> 26:23.680
But, you know, go around and drive around the streets of Bryan, and maybe somebody say, let's go to the Midnight Show.

26:25.181 --> 26:26.663
But there wasn't a whole lot to do.

26:27.624 --> 26:29.926
And were there Guy in Hall movies regularly?

26:30.167 --> 26:31.188
Guy in Hall movies.

26:31.548 --> 26:34.131
Did Aggies make noise doing Guy in Hall movies?

26:35.343 --> 26:37.547
I don't remember going to many movies over there.

26:38.348 --> 26:38.769
I don't know.

26:38.789 --> 26:39.390
I just don't have time.

26:39.410 --> 26:40.271
What about at the campus?

26:40.331 --> 26:42.034
Did Aggies make noise during the movie?

26:43.837 --> 26:46.942
I can't remember anything particularly about it.

26:47.984 --> 26:50.668
Was there, and where was the best place to get a hamburger?

26:53.838 --> 27:02.790
Well, I remember going to the drive-ins mainly for things like that.

27:02.910 --> 27:08.137
It seemed like there was one here and there was one in Bryan, but the Triangle drive-in was kind of the in thing.

27:10.540 --> 27:13.905
There weren't many eating places around here.

27:15.168 --> 27:17.010
I just can't remember much.

27:17.150 --> 27:20.554
And you didn't have an unlimited expense account?

27:20.574 --> 27:20.794
No.

27:22.156 --> 27:24.979
I didn't miss many meals in the dining hall.

27:25.459 --> 27:28.022
But you went to the football games.

27:28.122 --> 27:30.224
Did you make almost every Corps trip?

27:30.625 --> 27:32.587
Oh, yeah.

27:32.607 --> 27:36.872
Athletes, you know, lived over there together, but we were a military organization.

27:37.713 --> 27:42.778
And, you know, we did the same things and all that the rest of the Corps did except

27:42.758 --> 27:49.066
When our sport was in season, we had to practice together and we got to eat together and do those things.

27:49.106 --> 27:53.792
But, you know, we marched at the parades and final review and we did all those things.

27:53.972 --> 27:58.839
Did the other outfits kind of sneer at y'all as not being really military?

27:58.859 --> 28:06.288
Well, I think there was some feeling that, you know, we got off light on some things and, you know, we had some perks and privileges there.

28:07.149 --> 28:08.631
Did they have a nickname for y'all?

28:09.438 --> 28:10.439
I don't remember anything.

28:11.121 --> 28:13.103
Did your outfit have a nickname at all?

28:15.447 --> 28:17.730
Just Biggie Company Athletics is all I remember.

28:17.750 --> 28:19.533
And then you moved over to the Air Force.

28:19.593 --> 28:19.894
Yes.

28:20.054 --> 28:21.055
And what outfit was that?

28:21.075 --> 28:21.877
Squadron 11.

28:22.337 --> 28:26.263
And what was it like to move to a new squadron that you had not grown up with?

28:27.365 --> 28:34.315
Well, you know, I found that they seemed very receptive to my coming, much more than they would today.

28:35.982 --> 28:38.085
This is when you're a junior?

28:39.506 --> 28:40.968
Just first of my junior year.

28:41.108 --> 28:42.750
Maybe the end of my sophomore, I see.

28:42.790 --> 28:43.771
I forget when he was.

28:43.811 --> 28:45.053
Maybe the end of the sophomore year.

28:45.533 --> 28:47.035
But I got started over there.

28:47.095 --> 28:57.788
But I was, I didn't have any trouble, you know, a lot of the guys were gone to class with and knew and it worked out fine.

28:57.768 --> 29:04.776
And I could have had a, you know, a major position in the Corps, except I got married.

29:05.837 --> 29:12.124
So that was something I, because I had to move to a day student unit then, which kind of changed things up.

29:12.204 --> 29:15.628
But again, I know Corps commanders that were married in those days.

29:15.728 --> 29:18.812
Oh, Bill High, class of 60, he was married his whole year.

29:19.913 --> 29:21.275
His wife stayed in San Antonio.

29:23.878 --> 29:24.138
Mm-hmm.

29:24.158 --> 29:24.298
Mm-hmm.

29:26.472 --> 29:35.554
As we're heading toward the end now, I want to try to think about the activities and the attitudes that are kind of special about A&M.

29:38.702 --> 29:43.975
Silver taps, muster, midnight yell practice,

29:44.984 --> 29:49.149
When you, do you remember being a part of final review the first time?

29:51.912 --> 29:52.633
Mm-hmm.

29:52.994 --> 29:55.877
What does a fish feel like during its first final?

29:55.897 --> 30:09.593
Well, it's a great load off your shoulders, a great relief, I would say, and some feeling of pride and accomplishment like I've made it.

30:10.014 --> 30:12.797
You know, I've proven myself I can stay.

30:13.553 --> 30:15.617
You know, I'm better for it.

30:16.498 --> 30:21.667
Did you kind of mentally think about what the survival rate was?

30:21.747 --> 30:28.339
Some were gone and... You know, you reflect back and a lot of them didn't stay.

30:28.359 --> 30:31.424
A lot of that hasn't changed.

30:31.444 --> 30:33.047
A lot of people still leave.

30:35.795 --> 30:38.778
Back to yell practice, one thing was different.

30:38.798 --> 30:47.426
We had yell practice at the Grove, mainly, and it seemed like it was every Tuesday night or Thursday night.

30:47.506 --> 30:48.127
I don't remember.

30:48.147 --> 30:50.369
Were there, did they tell fables then?

30:50.529 --> 30:51.130
Oh, yes.

30:51.871 --> 30:56.075
I remember Pinky Downs and coming over from, we loved Pinky Downs.

30:56.816 --> 30:59.158
But boy, he could get the crowd going.

30:59.218 --> 31:03.422
But he'd come to yell practice sometime, especially around bonfire time.

31:03.841 --> 31:06.967
That's another subject we'd talk about is a bonfire back in those days.

31:07.888 --> 31:08.329
Yeah.

31:08.349 --> 31:09.872
Talk about a bonfire.

31:10.193 --> 31:10.874
Very small.

31:12.657 --> 31:18.187
Even though I was in Hart Hall in athletics, we had to take our term guarding the bonfire and all that stuff.

31:18.207 --> 31:22.175
And it was over on the drill field there, which is just right across the way.

31:22.235 --> 31:24.499
It's so close.
