WEBVTT

00:03.220 --> 00:31.185
Are

00:03.220 --> 00:31.185
there

00:03.220 --> 00:31.185
some people out there in the state that you think 
deserve special credit for that support, special

00:03.220 --> 00:31.185
appreciation?

00:35.992 --> 00:44.382
not being particularly in the know about a lot of 
those things. I've always been an outsider. We

00:47.406 --> 00:52.211
were shielded from legislation. I think this is 
where the actions came. Are you aware of some

00:56.176 --> 00:59.620
governors or politicians that were helpful?

01:04.831 --> 01:06.272
Not particularly. I think there's some of those 
that were on the legislature budget board or those

01:06.553 --> 01:15.942
that met to listen to the presentations. Like I'm 
guessing Bill Moore. Bill Moore, probably. Bill

01:22.588 --> 01:27.973
was always a defender of and a promoter of Texas 
A&M. If it was the Tittle Wings team, I think Bill

01:27.993 --> 01:33.218
would have and our comparatively shy state 
representative. No, before, earlier. He went to

01:45.140 --> 01:46.143
our church. He was a Presbyterian bachelor. had an 
office above J.C. Penney in that, oh, what was his

01:50.866 --> 01:56.453
name? He later became a district, I mean, adjusted 
the piece. Oh, what was his name? He was on the

02:03.502 --> 02:06.125
Appropriations Committee. Is there any governor 
that was sensitive to veterinary medicine?

02:12.053 --> 02:13.575
Briscoe, Kahn? I would think Donald Briscoe. 
Yeah, I don't think Donald Briscoe, but I don't

02:14.496 --> 02:20.704
know of any particular instances in there that, 
like I say, I have claim innocence in no way. Which

02:25.527 --> 02:31.933
presidents do you think were the most, A&M 
presidents, were the most concerned about vet

02:25.527 --> 02:31.933
medicine?

02:43.484 --> 02:45.366
I never looked at the president's favorite. I 
thought the person that probably did more for vet

02:45.386 --> 02:50.050
medicine than as he did for the Institutes of 
Reserve, really. I just respect his attitude and

02:52.038 --> 03:04.914
what he did, even though he had opposition, and 
those were people who didn't want to be told

02:52.038 --> 03:04.914
anything. Are there any special moments that you 
recall with joy and pride when some special

03:04.934 --> 03:14.586
something happened?

03:20.168 --> 03:23.337
Probably when the Neopets school was open was one.

03:26.184 --> 03:29.634
I can't think of anything. My relationship there 
is one highlight.

03:52.636 --> 04:11.995
Of

03:52.636 --> 04:11.995
all your scholarly work, what one or two 
publications would you point to with greatest

03:52.636 --> 04:11.995
pride?

04:26.858 --> 04:32.704
My research was mainly diversified, very 
diversified. As I tell you, the one that I was most

04:32.724 --> 04:38.070
satisfied with was one of the horses, because we 
did define that. And it has an impact. We did some

04:42.195 --> 04:44.697
other things that I think were... This is the one 
about the, and the fence? Yes. Okay. Where did you

04:51.284 --> 04:52.866
publish that? Journal of American Medical 
Association, American Journal of Veterinary

04:54.331 --> 04:59.098
Research. And

05:01.061 --> 05:06.790
we had other publications on national disease. I 
did quite a bit on identifying new pathogens of

05:06.810 --> 05:17.506
fungi and worked with the National Institute of 
Health mycologists on those. And those were

05:18.708 --> 05:22.313
enjoyable because they new knowledge and the 
identification of new species, which have later

05:23.558 --> 05:30.086
been found in humans.

05:36.914 --> 05:47.528
Some of the others are, like I say, the one on the 
sheep has gotten less emphasis because sheep are

05:36.914 --> 05:47.528
just not that important anymore. And that's in 
some people's opinion. But

05:53.562 --> 06:16.052
I guess the thing that I've gotten satisfaction 
out of in my career has been my graduate program,

05:53.562 --> 06:16.052
which we had good people that came out and are 
well-represented.

06:17.774 --> 06:20.818
Which doctoral students would you point to with 
greatest pride?

06:26.587 --> 06:28.930
Well, I think Gary Adams is one. Ken Pierce.

06:37.759 --> 06:42.284
We had others like Gwynne Allman.

06:42.304 --> 06:46.268
Depending on accomplishments or other 
attention, Kirkland Kerr. Kerr, K-E-R-R. He went

06:50.433 --> 06:51.434
to LSU, didn't he? No, no. Well, he went to LSU, but 
then he went on. He's ill. All right,

06:54.768 --> 07:10.792
let's make believe that you...

06:54.768 --> 07:10.792
Who's that? Oh, Roger is one of your graduate

07:10.812 --> 07:19.546
students? Mm-hmm. Let's make believe that you've 
now just been hired as a consultant to give advice

07:20.215 --> 07:30.745
today to the Dean of Veterinary Medicine at Texas 
A&M. What advice would you give the Dean of

07:30.845 --> 07:34.068
Veterinary Medicine today?

07:39.593 --> 07:50.003
The Dean of Veterinary Medicine has to work on, 
it's fairly cool, for the faculty, individual

07:39.593 --> 07:50.003
faculty member, that he knows that that faculty 
member needs to excel for his own good and

07:50.810 --> 07:59.142
academically, which means being a scholar and 
being a good teacher. And then he should organize

08:00.404 --> 08:04.210
so he can promote that. And I think that

08:05.992 --> 08:19.652
I've got a lot of thanks for that.

08:29.453 --> 08:30.595
What are you going to tell him then? We just funded a 
chair in medical education.

08:40.168 --> 08:44.314
What they proposed may not be what I want to see. I 
would like to see a situation where a teacher can

08:44.334 --> 08:57.773
teach and a student comes to him wanting 
knowledge, but he does not have to quiz that

08:44.334 --> 08:57.773
student. by challenging them, but they can work 
together to accomplish this. Now, I know that's

09:04.920 --> 09:12.291
contrary to the great authoritarian power of the 
faculty member. But to me, it would be just a

09:13.553 --> 09:21.466
wonderful experience to be in a situation where a 
student comes to you, and he wants you. I don't

09:21.546 --> 09:22.628
understand this. And you feel like you can talk to 
him. Whether we're not worried about giving them

09:25.951 --> 09:30.275
the answer to the question you're going to ask. 
Sounds like a good plan to me. Yeah. I would love to

09:32.297 --> 09:33.518
see that. And that's what they're fortunate with 
this, is it'll work with young faculty.

09:47.631 --> 09:49.392
That was the advice for the department. No, that 
was for the dean. For the dean. OK. Now, what advice

09:52.355 --> 09:55.958
would you give to the department?

09:58.435 --> 09:59.376
Or an apartment head? Either way. Well, I think 
that each faculty member needs an apartment head

10:01.019 --> 10:09.391
that nobody respects.

10:11.574 --> 10:18.423
And I always had this philosophy, and I think I got 
this, I guess, from the years of Earl Broder.

10:23.651 --> 10:25.253
His philosophy was... I propose a raise for this 
person or a promotion and his answer would be, you

10:27.190 --> 10:42.312
hired this person and he told me he was a good 
teacher, he's going to be an excellent person.

10:42.332 --> 10:52.107
He's a leader in his field and we paid, set a budget 
to pay him for this and we're paying him for that.

10:53.168 --> 10:54.210
What has he done now? to warrant this. Tell me. 
Don't tell me again he's a good teacher. And I feel

11:03.459 --> 11:15.018
like that if department heads could approach the 
thing, what can I do for you today? And if I go as your

11:15.118 --> 11:24.012
representative to the dean, what can I tell the 
dean that you're done? Now, were you a believer in

11:26.000 --> 11:29.484
merit salary? Oh, yes. And I believe in demerit 
salaries. Because I think that there is such a

11:35.111 --> 11:53.374
thing that faculty members take, some faculty 
members take a job,

11:35.111 --> 11:53.374
this is mine, I'm going to do this, and they'll say, 
this is an opportunity for me. And those that want a

11:53.394 --> 11:55.517
position And there's one thing, a difference from 
those who want opportunity. And I think that needs

12:01.620 --> 12:08.811
to be conveyed to the faculty by the department 
heads in such a way. And I think one of the problems

12:08.831 --> 12:18.687
is that people are hired now not knowing that they 
may want to expect it at a certain time because

12:08.831 --> 12:18.687
nobody says so.

12:22.244 --> 12:27.770
Now one of my standard questions at this point, 
you've just answered in an unusual way. Normally I

12:28.411 --> 12:35.138
say, if you could make a very significant gift to 
Texas A&M, what would it be for? And you've

12:36.139 --> 12:38.802
already, yeah. Has that been announced? Okay. I 
think it has. It's been in the veterinary thing.

12:45.929 --> 12:46.890
Okay. Okay. I think the...

12:54.222 --> 13:01.254
Foundation is going to have it in their magazine.

13:02.155 --> 13:04.840
Right then, I have only two other questions.

13:07.624 --> 13:09.888
What does it mean to be a Texas Aggie? What is 
special about being a product of this

13:10.649 --> 13:14.315
institution?

13:18.042 --> 13:20.145
I have to say I'm proud to be a Texas Aggie. For a long 
time, I didn't know what it meant to be a Texan

13:22.994 --> 13:26.978
Aggie. I was a graduate of this institute. I got a 
degree. I'm going out and conquering the world or

13:29.060 --> 13:31.502
whatever. And I had a little office over in 
Brennan.

13:43.534 --> 13:46.117
I'm old. A little bit emotional, but Hugh Miller 
used to come to me, sit in my office and talk to me. He

13:53.015 --> 13:56.360
didn't talk about the Aggies, are we going to win, 
or that. He just was interested in what was going

13:56.380 --> 13:58.564
on. He was a good neighbor. And I had other people 
that do the same thing.

14:11.844 --> 14:13.407
Charlie Rankin used to come by. He was,

14:13.427 --> 14:20.558
I never knew that the Aggies were supposed to be 
important to each other. We're supposed to be

14:21.820 --> 14:22.721
what? Important to each other. Oh. Significant. 
And I just, it wasn't engendered in me because I'd

14:27.267 --> 14:30.511
gone through work. I

14:30.671 --> 14:38.761
guess because I wasn't a member of the Corps. I 
lived in the unit. My background is a little

14:39.722 --> 14:42.306
different, I can say. Sometimes I'm almost 
embarrassed.

14:49.415 --> 14:49.735
But... Yeah, I'm proud to be

14:51.149 --> 14:55.113
an Aggie. All right, then the last question is a 
follow-up on that. What feelings do you have in

14:57.395 --> 15:00.959
your heart about A&M today?

15:12.451 --> 15:16.094
I believe in education.

15:16.114 --> 15:17.896
I believe in the learning process. And Mildred's 
going to get mad at me if I say it. I believe in God.

15:27.557 --> 15:34.453
God and the church.

15:52.692 --> 16:02.972
division

15:52.692 --> 16:02.972
organization has killed a lot of the spirit and in

16:24.620 --> 16:27.828
And that, I guess, is way over. But we always 
second-guess other people's behaviors, and

16:27.848 --> 16:33.903
that's probably one of them. Let me ask you 
something else. You said when he retired, but he

16:34.966 --> 16:38.655
just stepped down. Oh. And then stayed. When did 
you retire then? In 86 first and then I went half

16:43.534 --> 16:56.538
time and continued my research and then I spent 
some time, went to New Zealand and lectured and a

16:43.534 --> 16:56.538
few things like that. So you served a total of how 
many years? Oh, I guess to the 80th. I was

17:07.685 --> 17:09.527
I think the record says 54. It was a period of time, a 
few months in there, that I served as an interim

17:09.687 --> 17:14.811
basis.

17:18.134 --> 17:20.496
But I would say 54 to 88.

17:33.547 --> 17:37.590
Have we left out anything important that you want 
to be sure to include? All right, well, let's

17:38.937 --> 17:46.770
quit at that.
