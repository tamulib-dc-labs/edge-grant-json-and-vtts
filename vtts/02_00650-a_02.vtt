WEBVTT

00:12.687 --> 00:17.474
He could look at the weather map and say, it's going 
to stop raining at 1215. We can go for a picnic. We

00:20.017 --> 00:23.582
have to be back by 315, because the rain's going to 
start again. And he was always right within 15

00:24.243 --> 00:26.005
minutes. So then, really just incredible.

00:32.274 --> 00:42.508
Another man was a man named Sparrow Petterson, who 
later came to this country and became a professor

00:32.274 --> 00:42.508
of meteorology at MIT and president of the 
American Meteorological Society. He was a

00:43.822 --> 00:53.475
good first-rate meteorologist, but not really 
with the great intuition that Bjerknes had.

00:56.359 --> 01:02.888
Another man was an engineer named Odd Dahl, who'd 
been with Sverdrup on the Maud expedition. The

01:03.689 --> 01:06.713
Maud was the thing which really shaped Sverdrup's 
life. The Norwegians, ever since the 1890s, when

01:07.935 --> 01:13.322
Nansen tried to do what he did and succeeded in 
freezing his ship, the Fram, in the polar ice. He

01:22.800 --> 01:26.144
had the idea that you could drift across the North 
Pole. You just got in the right place in the Arctic

01:26.745 --> 01:35.597
Ocean in a ship

01:26.745 --> 01:35.597
or something to live on. And the other great 
Norwegian explorer, Amundsen, Roald Amundsen,

01:45.112 --> 01:46.814
had a ship built called the Maud. And they tried 
this stunt again in the 1920s,

01:48.496 --> 02:02.550
late 19, just about the end of World War II, going up 
to about 1923 or 1924. The ship, they actually

02:02.570 --> 02:10.258
tried this twice, and altogether, it's fair to 
have spent seven years frozen in the Arctic.

02:13.580 --> 02:14.621
profound experience. There were only about five 
or six of them on the moor, a very, very small crew.

02:21.671 --> 02:32.245
And being Norwegians, they managed to get along 
together for this ungodly long time in a terrible,

02:21.671 --> 02:32.245
what seems to me to be terrible, a terrible 
situation. They did it by having, by being very

02:32.265 --> 02:35.630
rigorously disciplined.

02:38.233 --> 02:43.080
Sverdrup went off one winter and spent the winter 
with the Chukchi.

02:43.685 --> 02:52.435
Eskimo-like people who lived in Siberia, and 
wrote a book about it called Post-Chukchi Folket,

02:43.685 --> 02:52.435
with the Chukchi people.

02:56.719 --> 03:04.628
Most of the time, he had a very full program of 
observations of all kinds of geophysical

02:56.719 --> 03:04.628
phenomena. And he spent years and years writing up 
the results.

03:13.317 --> 03:23.014
He was all over this by the time he came to Scripps, 
but he was then working on the results of the

03:13.317 --> 03:23.014
Carnegie, this non-magnetic job that I was 
telling you about.

03:29.204 --> 03:34.032
And he really brought science, physical science, 
to the Scripps Institution. Vaughan, his

03:35.254 --> 03:37.418
predecessor, was a a paleontologist interested 
in corals. And he was the, I guess, the leading

03:42.842 --> 03:59.383
authority on the taxonomy of fossil corals, and 
also on the taxonomy of the larger foraminifera,

03:42.842 --> 03:59.383
formed of these big things like the mumulites that 
you find in Egypt. And the way he got into

03:59.403 --> 04:06.072
oceanography was by

04:07.672 --> 04:12.878
deciding that in order to understand dead corals, 
he had to understand living corals, the ecology of

04:07.672 --> 04:12.878
living corals. He made a famous series of 
experiments in which he took little pieces of

04:12.898 --> 04:29.959
coral and stuck them to something like a board or 
something like that, and hung them in the water, in

04:12.898 --> 04:29.959
tropical waters, and watched how fast they grew. 
Heard that they grow surprisingly fast,

04:29.979 --> 04:36.767
about one centimeter a year or something like 
that. And

04:37.928 --> 04:47.182
he always talked about the interrelations 
between marine organisms and their environment.

04:47.202 --> 04:48.304
That's what he thought oceanography was. One of 
the jobs that oceanographers had was to study

04:49.446 --> 04:53.371
those things. That's something we now call 
ecology.

05:04.909 --> 05:06.231
He wasn't very interested in in physiology or 
biochemistry, didn't understand biochemistry.

05:14.573 --> 05:22.268
And he didn't really think of marine organisms, as 
most biologists do, as simply instruments for

05:14.573 --> 05:22.268
studying biology. He thought that oceanography 
should be concerned with, as I said, the ecology of

05:22.368 --> 05:31.484
marine

05:22.368 --> 05:31.484
organisms. In this respect, he was very much like 
his predecessor, William E. Ritter, the first

05:33.970 --> 05:39.739
director of the Scripps Institution. Ritter was a 
professor of zoology at Berkeley, and he founded

05:40.900 --> 05:49.112
something here in La Jolla called the Scripps 
Institution for Biological Research. If you go

05:50.314 --> 05:56.603
down that grade by the Scripps Institution, it's 
still called the biological grade. I often

05:56.623 --> 06:02.492
wondered why it was called that, but then I, of 
course, found much later that it was simply

05:56.623 --> 06:02.492
because that's where the biological was.

06:06.455 --> 06:15.205
Ritter had exactly the same notion that Vaughan 
had, that you had to study whole organisms. He

06:15.225 --> 06:23.695
wrote a famous book called The California 
Woodpecker and I, which argued his point of view.

06:24.976 --> 06:27.799
At that time, biology was going in just the 
opposite direction. It was going down from the

06:27.819 --> 06:32.665
whole organism to organs and to cells and to 
molecules. That's been the history of biology,

06:33.860 --> 06:43.389
really, for the last 70 years or so, 60 years, since 
about 1915. And this, of course, has led to a

06:44.890 --> 06:48.113
revolution in biology. But we're just now coming 
back to Ritter's idea that one of the important

06:49.274 --> 07:03.748
things that we need to learn about is a very much 
more difficult subject than the study of organs,

06:49.274 --> 07:03.748
or cells, or molecules, is the study of the whole 
creature, the whole animal, or the whole plant in

07:04.049 --> 07:15.144
relation to other plants and other animals, which 
is a major part of their environment. Ecology is a

07:16.786 --> 07:27.139
very important subject, which is

07:16.786 --> 07:27.139
worked on by a completely inadequate group of 
people. There's not enough competent people in

07:27.740 --> 07:32.166
that field. And it was because of Ritter's 
disgust, really, or vigorous opposition to the

07:33.597 --> 07:55.604
reductionists that the Scripps Institution 
changed its name in 1924 from Scripps Institution

07:33.597 --> 07:55.604
for Biological Research to the Scripps 
Institution of Oceanography. Well,

07:55.624 --> 07:59.709
it became part of it. He started it by... every 
summer for about seven or eight years,

08:03.803 --> 08:11.115
establishing a biological, a biologist's summer 
camp somewhere along the California coast. In

08:12.357 --> 08:24.737
those days, every university and every college 
tried to have a marine biological camp or station,

08:12.357 --> 08:24.737
because there's such a wonderful variety and 
diversity of marine organisms. And he had a summer

08:24.757 --> 08:28.444
camp in various places. He ended up in Coronado. 
and interested a man named Fred Baker here in San

08:31.394 --> 08:36.799
Diego in his work. And Baker persuaded him to stay 
and to settle here and have a permanent station, or

08:38.560 --> 08:49.990
at least come here year after year in the 
summertime. And the last one they had, the last one

08:51.071 --> 09:00.979
of these summer stations they had was at the Cove, 
just north of the Valencia Hotel. here in La Jolla.

09:04.749 --> 09:12.520
And then

09:04.749 --> 09:12.520
Ritter became a very good friend of E.W. Scripps, 
the newspaper man. Scripps was a monologist. He

09:19.330 --> 09:21.333
talked all the time. And Ritter was one of the very 
few people who could talk back to him. And Scripps

09:25.939 --> 09:28.603
was fascinated by this. And he said, I'm not 
endowing an institution. I want to endow a man

09:31.747 --> 09:34.009
named Ed Ritter.

09:38.934 --> 09:39.674
Yes, I gave him that.

09:44.058 --> 09:54.387
Scripps managed to con the city of San Diego into 
giving or to selling him a Pueblo lot.

09:54.407 --> 09:58.371
He said, San Diego's an old Spanish Pueblo.

09:59.330 --> 10:05.699
It has a great deal of land, which we call the Pueblo 
lands of the city of San Diego. And they divided

10:05.719 --> 10:08.583
this up into lots of about 180 acres. La Jolla is on 
several, two or three of these lots. And there was

10:13.550 --> 10:21.582
180 acres where the Scripps Institution is now, 
which Scripps was able to buy from the city for

10:13.550 --> 10:21.582
$1,000. And

10:21.602 --> 10:27.430
the city wanted, this was a philanthropic, it 
wasn't a, It was worth more than $1,000 even then,

10:28.422 --> 10:30.604
of course. But they got it very cheaply in order to 
establish this, to build a permanent building

10:30.624 --> 10:38.552
there for the Scripps Institution. And the first 
building there was the so-called Scripps

10:39.773 --> 10:45.719
Building, which is still there, built in the early 
1900s. And in 1912, the institution became part of

10:45.879 --> 10:56.269
the University of California as the Scripps 
Institution for Biological Research. And

10:56.671 --> 11:09.465
Scripps and his sister, Ellen Browning Scripps, 
all together gave them an endowment worth about

10:56.671 --> 11:09.465
$500,000 in those days of stock. Most of the stock 
was in the Detroit News,

11:09.485 --> 11:18.555
the evening news association. And they still have 
that stock. And that used to provide the salary of

11:21.117 --> 11:25.362
the director.

11:37.475 --> 11:46.068
But of course, it's a very small part of the total 
income, minuscule part of the total budget now.

11:46.088 --> 11:59.269
So the Scripps Institution, when it became the 
Scripps Institution of Oceanography, the name

11:46.088 --> 11:59.269
was changed basically because of Ritter's 
feeling that the biologists were going just the

11:46.088 --> 11:59.269
wrong direction.

12:02.614 --> 12:05.659
And it became then the first oceanographic 
institution in this country, one of the first in

12:06.230 --> 12:09.514
the world. Not the first in the world, but one of the 
early ones. Woods Hole Oceanographic

12:14.460 --> 12:31.621
Institution, which is the next

12:14.460 --> 12:31.621
major institution in this country, was started 
about 1931, about seven years later after the

12:14.460 --> 12:31.621
Scripps became the oceanographic institution.

12:31.641 --> 12:33.503
Although Woods Hole had had course for many years 
something called Marine Biological Laboratory,

12:34.512 --> 12:42.382
which was a summer place for biologists. That's 
still an independent entity at Woods Hole. And

12:45.466 --> 12:50.092
they had also had the Bureau of Fisheries, 
Fisheries Laboratory at Woods Hole. So they have a

12:52.535 --> 12:56.160
very long tradition of studying the ocean. We had a 
man here named Francis B. Sumner, who was brought

12:58.623 --> 13:02.528
here by Ritter Because he had

13:04.415 --> 13:20.795
done some very interesting early work on the color 
adaptations of fish to their environment. Fish

13:21.296 --> 13:32.970
that change color when they're, like the halibut 
and other flatfish, that change color when they,

13:21.296 --> 13:32.970
or change their patterns and their scales when 
they, for different environments. And Sumner

13:34.452 --> 13:48.392
became very much interested in the Lamarckian 
idea of proving or disproving the Lamarckian idea

13:34.452 --> 13:48.392
that acquired characteristics are inherited. He 
tested this out with mice. And he had thousands of

13:51.216 --> 13:52.658
mice. And there was a mouse house up on top of the 
hill just overlooking the present campus. And

13:59.108 --> 14:02.232
when Vaughan came, he made him Sumner always 
described that the institution went wet. And

14:08.177 --> 14:13.666
Blond thought that this work on mice was not really 
appropriate for an oceanographic institution.

14:14.548 --> 14:17.092
So he made Sumner really stop it after a few years. 
And Sumner went back to his fish and did some,

14:18.234 --> 14:29.873
continued to do very interesting things on 
adaptations of fish to temperature and to other

14:18.234 --> 14:29.873
environmental factors. really just the kind of 
ecology that one thought ought to be done. He's

14:37.788 --> 14:41.834
always quite bitter about having to give up his 
experiments on mice. He was a contemporary of

14:41.854 --> 14:47.602
Morgan, a great Drosophila man. And Morgan won the 
Nobel Prize, basically because he chose the right

14:49.305 --> 14:59.640
experimental animal, Drosophila, which 
reproduce every few years. days or every few

15:00.093 --> 15:04.638
weeks, I guess it is, whereas mice take months. So 
Morgan could get a great many more generations

15:05.859 --> 15:12.607
with an experiment than Sumner could. It's an 
interesting example of how much of a role luck

15:13.468 --> 15:23.199
plays, or perhaps insight or intuition. Sumner 
became a member of the National Academy of

15:24.820 --> 15:28.024
Sciences, long after Morgan had won his Nobel 
Prize. Well, I'm sorry I digressed to the early

15:33.239 --> 15:38.345
part of the institution. But coming back to what I 
did, or what we did after I became an instructor and

15:38.385 --> 15:53.263
after I came back from Norway,

15:38.385 --> 15:53.263
a man named Francis Shepard appeared here in 1937. 
I guess he'd actually been here before that. He'd

15:58.818 --> 16:02.524
been here even while I was a graduate student. He 
was very much interested in submarine canyons.

16:06.630 --> 16:23.698
And he got a grant from the Geological Society of 
America for $12,000, I think it was, to

16:06.630 --> 16:23.698
study the marine geology off the Southern 
California coast.

16:23.718 --> 16:25.180
By that time, we had a new ship.

16:36.601 --> 16:44.713
The old scripts, the one I told you about, had blown 
up in the harbor here in San Diego, as it seems to

16:36.601 --> 16:44.713
happen to oceanographic ships. They had an 
explosion which killed the cook, this fellow

16:44.733 --> 16:51.863
Frank I was telling you about, and very seriously 
injured, murdered Ross. Never really recovered.

16:57.090 --> 16:59.093
This was while we were in, Ellen and I were in 
Norway. And so Harold Sparger managed to persuade

17:04.951 --> 17:15.305
Robert P. Scripps, the son of E.W., was then the 
editor and publisher of the Scripps-Howard

17:04.951 --> 17:15.305
Papers, to buy him a yacht. He bought Lewis Stone's 
yacht, called Serrano, S-E-R-R-A-N-O, and

17:15.705 --> 17:25.038
renamed it the E.W. Scripps. This was a famous 
early oceanographic boat in the United States.

17:34.465 --> 17:36.708
It was a top-sail schooner, a Gloster schooner. 
They cut off the top mast, but we retained the

17:37.769 --> 17:46.621
regular mast.

17:46.641 --> 17:51.087
And for years, we sailed this ship as well as drove 
it under power. Gradually, the mast got shorter,

17:52.208 --> 17:55.633
and the engines got bigger. And after World War II, 
it gave up sailing altogether. It was just really a

17:59.959 --> 18:01.080
powerboat. This is in contrast to Woods Hole, 
which had a yawl named the Atlantis. It was built

18:07.879 --> 18:11.245
about 1932. And which Columbus Islin, the famous 
director of Woods Hole, was the first captain of.

18:20.538 --> 18:24.604
She remained a sailing vessel all during her 
career. But we gradually got it. use the sails only

18:29.545 --> 18:31.347
to steady the ship. You could try something to 
steady the ship. By that time, we had a

18:34.371 --> 18:36.193
professional crew. We had a captain and several 
members of the crew, in addition to the graduate

18:36.273 --> 18:51.230
students who still were also stood watches, 
regular sailors watches. But the engine room and

18:53.232 --> 18:58.118
the officers, we had a couple of officers on the 
ship. Other

18:58.604 --> 19:09.981
people like that were all professional sailors.

19:14.327 --> 19:22.559
Shepard had brought out with him two graduate 
students, Bob Dietz and Kenneth Emery, one of whom

19:14.327 --> 19:22.559
is now a member of the National Academy. The other 
is a famous oceanographer and marine geologist

19:26.262 --> 19:33.231
with NOAA, the National Ocean and Atmospheric 
Administration. He's one of the primary authors

19:33.251 --> 19:39.759
of the theory of sea floor spreading, Bob Dietz. 
And he also brought with him two guys from UCLA,

19:42.142 --> 19:55.780
whose names I can't remember, who had an idea about 
building a coring machine. device for taking

19:56.063 --> 19:57.605
cores. I don't think of their names, but I can't 
think of

19:59.848 --> 20:07.079
the form of it. They were basically engineers and 
very expensive taste. They spent a lot of money on

20:14.670 --> 20:16.793
this damn coring machine. The theory of it was that

20:16.813 --> 20:23.623
you would open a valve and the water would

20:26.624 --> 20:29.928
rush into a chamber, and in the process...

20:34.995 --> 20:36.497
I'm sorry, that's not quite right. You plunged it. 
This was a cylinder on top of a core barrel, and

20:37.979 --> 20:44.768
there was a valve between the core barrel and the 
cylinder. You opened that valve, and the barrel

20:45.289 --> 20:56.344
would sink into the mud because of the suction 
created by this empty cylinder. And essentially,

20:57.353 --> 21:04.480
mud would be sucked up to fill the back room. The 
trouble with this device was that the forces were

21:04.680 --> 21:10.465
too great. Something always broke. We spent 
thousands of dollars on it. It never really worked

21:16.290 --> 21:17.571
very well. It was about that time that Kuhlenberg 
was developing his

21:27.914 --> 21:45.055
really

21:27.914 --> 21:45.055
operated on a very similar principle. And also 
when Charles Piggott was developing his gun, the

21:45.936 --> 21:50.061
Piggott gun. And the Piggott gun, in fact, really 
worked pretty well. Of course, the Hulenberg

21:55.387 --> 21:57.550
Corridor worked very well indeed. That was much, 
the Kuhlenberg Corp really came after World War

22:00.128 --> 22:05.675
II. And we, anyhow, what we, one of the major things 
we did was to study the submarine geology off this

22:05.695 --> 22:20.194
coast and the sediments and their distribution. 
Then in 1938 or 39, I guess, 39, we had an expedition

22:20.435 --> 22:28.185
to the Gulf of California. That was the longest. 
farthest away from home the Scripps Institution

22:30.571 --> 22:33.254
vessel had ever been. And we did all sorts of 
things, and we built what the Russians now call a,

22:35.036 --> 22:52.814
what do they call it, essentially a mixed 
oceanographic expedition, doing biology and

22:35.036 --> 22:52.814
geology and physical oceanography and chemical 
oceanography all at the same time. Was that fairly

22:54.096 --> 22:55.277
unusual? The early oceanographic institutions 
didn't do that? Yes, they did, because that was the

22:58.347 --> 23:19.554
way that

22:58.347 --> 23:19.554
all these big expeditions had operated, the 
Meteor Expedition, the Challenger Expedition,

22:58.347 --> 23:19.554
and the, well,

22:58.347 --> 23:19.554
there were half a dozen others in the very early 
days. The last big expedition, the Snellius

23:20.876 --> 23:27.004
Expedition in the East Indies, all of these big 
expeditions conducted everything at once,

23:27.423 --> 23:32.008
basically because ships were so expensive. The 
Carnegie did the same thing, chemistry and

23:32.028 --> 23:37.795
physics and biology and geology.

23:42.320 --> 23:46.985
And that was what we did on our first expedition to 
the Gulf of California.

23:50.670 --> 23:53.172
And this was a remarkable place. In the first 
place, it was very wild. Very few people there. One

24:00.705 --> 24:08.493
island, Tiburon Island, still had Indians on it, 
living pretty much as they lived thousands of

24:00.705 --> 24:08.493
years ago. Very, very primitive Indians. There 
were a few settlements, the settlement of La Paz,

24:13.038 --> 24:27.332
the settlement at Loreto,

24:13.038 --> 24:27.332
half a dozen settlements altogether, small 
relics of the missions or In one case, a famous

24:27.717 --> 24:33.606
mining camp, a copper mining camp. But the most 
interesting thing about the Gulf was the water.

24:36.430 --> 24:42.859
The water just, while the shore was a desert, the 
water just teemed with life. And this was because

24:42.879 --> 24:46.504
of the very peculiar circulation. It had been 
called by Cortes the Mare Vermejo, the Vermilion

24:47.926 --> 24:54.636
Sea. The reason it was called the Vermilion Sea was 
that it looked like tomato soup in the springtime.

25:01.174 --> 25:17.611
You had an enormous plankton bloom every spring, 
and literally if you went out in a small boat at

25:01.174 --> 25:17.611
night and dipped your oars in the water, the whole 
sea would light up for hundreds of yards around the

25:01.174 --> 25:17.611
ship from luminescent organisms. And the reason 
for this was that the surface water of the gulf was

25:17.631 --> 25:24.538
blown out of the gulf by northerly winds, and deep 
water came in to take its place. And deep water was

25:28.422 --> 25:30.044
rich in nutrients. Surface water was poorer with 
nutrients. So the nutrient concentration was

25:33.608 --> 25:36.792
extremely high. And it came right up to the surface 
where the plankton organisms live. The bottom

25:45.924 --> 25:48.467
deposits, as a result,

25:54.421 --> 26:22.302
literally almost nothing but diatoms diatoms and 
other skeletons of other plankton organisms and

25:54.421 --> 26:22.302
these were layered in bars layer after layer the 
bottom in other words was anaerobic there was so

25:54.421 --> 26:22.302
much organic matter settling to the bottom oxygen 
was all used up so you got beautiful layered

25:54.421 --> 26:22.302
sediments and the

25:54.421 --> 26:22.302
of course the The chemistry of the water was 
fascinating, and the geology was even more

26:22.990 --> 26:36.867
fascinating, because we didn't know it then, but 
this is the border

26:22.990 --> 26:36.867
of the two tectonic plates. And you get these very 
complicated trenches and ridges and troughs and

26:38.108 --> 26:51.765
other zones of extreme tectonic activity, 
because it was right in there. because it was right

26:53.905 --> 27:01.517
on the edge of the Pacific plate and the North 
American

26:53.905 --> 27:01.517
plate. It's a continuation of the South Pacific, 
the Easter Island rise, and the San Andreas Rift in

27:01.537 --> 27:08.528
California itself. It's a place very much like the 
Rift Valley in Africa and the Red Sea, which is

27:09.569 --> 27:15.859
where the Earth is pulling apart. We didn't, of 
course, know it then, but we were fascinated by it.

27:20.973 --> 27:32.748
had a very complicated basin and range structure 
of the place, and these basins each had these

27:20.973 --> 27:32.748
anaerobic conditions in them.

27:32.768 --> 27:34.070
And so we went back again. We got a grant from the 
Geological Society of America, another grant,

27:34.110 --> 27:41.139
and went back again to the Gulf. And at that time, it 
was a purely geological expedition. Emory was on

27:46.325 --> 27:50.811
it, and Charlie Anderson, the Geological Survey, 
Fran Shepard and I, and several of our younger

27:52.192 --> 28:11.293
people, quite a few publications came out of this 
on the geology of the, not only the marine, but the

27:52.192 --> 28:11.293
land geology of the lower California and the Gulf 
of California. And the whole thing was really

28:12.495 --> 28:20.764
exploration of a very interesting kind.

28:26.279 --> 28:32.706
At about that time, the

28:26.279 --> 28:32.706
war started in Europe in 1939. It started the 
summer or the fall of the year that 1939, there was

28:32.846 --> 28:47.622
another meeting of the International Union of 
Geology and Geophysics in Washington. It was a

28:49.644 --> 28:53.788
very sad meeting because the war had started. All 
these people from Europe that I told you about

28:54.950 --> 28:58.615
before were there at that meeting, too. Many of 
them we never saw again. And we here at Scripps were

29:01.799 --> 29:08.589
getting interested in underwater sound. There 
was a naval officer named Ross Bennett,

29:09.650 --> 29:23.910
R-A-W-S-O-N-E-N-N-E-T-T,

29:09.650 --> 29:23.910
two T's, who was the operations officer or 
technical officer of a division of destroyers

29:24.498 --> 29:33.934
here which were testing sonar here. The head of the 
skipper of this division was a man named Berhans,

29:33.954 --> 29:39.403
who later became an admiral. They both became 
admirals. And they were really testing, trying to

29:42.688 --> 29:51.282
understand what happened in the ocean to affect 
the performance of sonar here. what we used to call

29:52.426 --> 29:56.930
underwater sound gear in those days. And Ross and 
Bennett came out to Scripps and talked to

29:56.950 --> 30:13.445
Sparadrip and Dick Fleming and me, and we 
developed a theory of what was, of the propagation

29:56.950 --> 30:13.445
of sound in seawater, a ray theory, a very simple 
theory. Essentially, ray optics. At the same time

30:17.749 --> 30:21.572
that Ewing and Islam were doing it, it was all quite 
unknown to us. And then later, the summer of 1941, I

30:23.408 --> 30:30.131
went into the Navy. Can't change that thing again.
