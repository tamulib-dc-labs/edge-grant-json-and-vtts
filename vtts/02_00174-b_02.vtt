WEBVTT

00:02.883 --> 00:18.501
If it was local,

00:02.883 --> 00:18.501
I think it had to be, I don't know where people went. 
Was Uncle Ed still going? Uncle Ed, for that type of

00:21.945 --> 00:31.776
partying, which was usually just bowl sessions.

00:32.667 --> 00:35.191
But yeah, Uncle Ed's was there until. And none of 
those places that had been out near the air base

00:36.513 --> 00:43.544
during the war, those were. Well, there was a, I was 
never, never went there. There was something, it

00:48.151 --> 00:50.474
had the name Purple.

00:53.259 --> 01:00.750
And it was between the, it was on 21 or within a block 
of Highway 21 somewhere. But it was a pretty tough

01:01.405 --> 01:03.688
place. That was my impression of it. And

01:08.315 --> 01:18.869
there was a place there where wieners in Bryan 
there at Highway 21 and 6. Now, there used to be

01:19.310 --> 01:25.939
something, a dance hall, one of these country 
western. And that was a pretty popular place. But

01:31.510 --> 02:01.045
really uh we go there were these big drive-ins the 
texas drive-in down there where the chicken

01:31.510 --> 02:01.045
what's

01:31.510 --> 02:01.045
that dixie chicken dixie chicken yeah at the 
triangle at the triangle uh the texan and then and

01:31.510 --> 02:01.045
the triangle drive-in also there in the triangle 
and then there was another one in on down on highway

01:31.510 --> 02:01.045
six in Bryan. And those were popular hangout type 
places. Did you, were y'all aware of a bootlegger

02:07.796 --> 02:12.901
in Brazos County? I've not heard of anybody who 
was. No, I knew of the Jones. Whiskey Bridge.

02:19.427 --> 02:21.449
Whiskey Bridge, uh-huh. And that, that's one of 
the things, my first, I had my first, my

02:21.469 --> 02:32.280
introduction to wine.

02:32.648 --> 02:39.676
when I was in summer school as a freshman after the 
bull ring one Saturday afternoon. And it was

02:39.756 --> 02:42.058
really a scorcher. This would have, it was the 
latter part of the summer. And fished triple buzz

02:47.605 --> 02:53.731
boy Yarbrough from Mississippi. He was, his dad 
owned a large hunk of Mississippi Delta. And He had

03:03.023 --> 03:05.206
an Oldsmobile 88. And so he took us, he wanted to go 
out to Whiskey Bridge after the bull ring was

03:07.570 --> 03:19.308
finished, and we'd get something to drink. He had a 
card fixed and everything. And he got us, each one

03:22.753 --> 03:31.326
of us, a bottle, a chilled bottle of wine. And it was 
sweet wine. Tasted like, you know, tasted like

03:34.873 --> 03:41.962
chilled grape juice or fruit juice. And sweet. And 
boy, I was hot and thirsty. And that was good. And so

03:51.976 --> 03:54.980
I drank mine on the way back to town. And I was 
through easy before we got back into town. to the

04:00.550 --> 04:03.633
campus.

04:05.515 --> 04:13.844
And that stuff hit me just as we were walking from 
the parking lot into the dorm. And they said they

04:14.204 --> 04:21.152
essentially drug me to my bed, you know, and laid me 
out. Now, as far as you recall, was there any

04:23.454 --> 04:29.781
checking in those days to be sure that someone was 
18 to buy whatever they were buying. You just had to

04:36.000 --> 04:38.002
be ready, as I remember. My impression was that it 
was pretty hit or miss. I don't remember any checks

04:43.268 --> 04:45.351
or anything. What were people smoking then?

04:54.542 --> 04:59.127
Chesterfield cigarettes, Camel cigarettes, and 
Lucky Strikes were the big three. And we had, there

04:59.798 --> 05:09.394
was a guy who, from Houston, who brought a 
cigarette rolling machine with him. And so you

05:10.255 --> 05:14.843
could buy Bull Durham or Prince Albert and roll 
your own. And he was very popular with the people

05:14.883 --> 05:20.532
that smoked. I

05:20.592 --> 05:26.802
tried a few cigarettes. that summer of my freshman 
year and in the fall I started smoking kind of on a

05:27.473 --> 05:37.546
spotty basis, but that's when I started smoking 
anyway. About what percentage, reckon, of the

05:37.766 --> 05:43.714
students smoked

05:37.766 --> 05:43.714
then?

05:47.579 --> 05:47.740
Oh.

05:52.746 --> 05:54.328
It wasn't unusual. There were quite a few people 
smoked. It was common to go into a room and at least

05:58.473 --> 06:04.320
one person be smoking. And it was okay to smoke in 
the room. Yeah. You never thought about, not about

06:07.184 --> 06:11.950
asking anyone if you could smoke there. What about 
pipes and cigars?

06:18.097 --> 06:24.565
A few cigars, no pipes that I remember until, well, 
toward the end of my vet school time, I began to

06:24.815 --> 06:30.783
notice some of the faculty and graduate students. 
Chewing tobacco and snuff?

06:35.429 --> 06:40.355
Not very often, but I don't remember any snuff, but 
some chewing tobacco. Was that country? Yeah,

06:41.957 --> 06:44.140
yeah. And heroin and marijuana? Didn't know 
anything about that. Did you even know the words?

06:49.467 --> 06:49.527
No. That's right.

06:55.747 --> 06:58.030
Did anybody ever drink a mixed drink? Yeah, 
well... Which to me meant putting something in a

07:03.477 --> 07:05.781
Coca-Cola. Uh-huh, something like that. Rum and 
Coca-Cola. Or vodka. Yeah. This was a big thing at

07:13.271 --> 07:18.598
the big college dances in Chicago. in Sabisa or one 
of the, you know, here on campus. And people would

07:23.282 --> 07:40.440
go to elaborate means of concealing their bottle 
and take it into the, to Sabisa or wherever so they

07:23.282 --> 07:40.440
could have their mixed drinks. How did Aggies, in 
fact, how did Aggies behave at those campus

07:40.561 --> 07:46.527
dances? Well,

07:48.886 --> 07:56.437
most of them were very well behaved, I thought. And 
how were the women treated? Well, like queens.

08:01.284 --> 08:04.368
Yeah, this was a very standard. I mean, if a woman, a 
date was not treated that way, it was clearly the

08:04.389 --> 08:16.446
exception and just a very glaring happening for 
women. for a date not to be treated very much like a

08:17.725 --> 08:23.473
princess. Had you and your buddies heard about a 
chicken ranch at La Grange? Did you know it

08:29.200 --> 08:30.242
existed? Yeah, we knew of that, but I can't 
remember when I knew of that. Was it while you were

08:42.158 --> 08:43.880
an undergraduate? Yeah, but I can't remember how. 
how long I'd been here, whenever I learned. Did you

08:49.790 --> 08:51.737
hear of any Aggies going over there?

08:56.694 --> 09:00.928
Well, yeah, you heard people talking about it, but 
you didn't know. whether it was or is wishful

09:02.140 --> 09:05.827
thinking or whatever. I have wondered if the stage 
version, which has a chicken ranch visit by Aggies

09:06.027 --> 09:19.872
as a part of being a part of the Corps, I wondered if 
that's been made up. I haven't heard much about in

09:21.074 --> 09:26.123
all these interviews. The Korean War was going on 
by this time. Yeah. What did you and your buddies,

09:30.931 --> 09:37.319
what were you all thinking about the war and what it 
might mean to you? Well,

09:38.721 --> 09:55.063
this was a common

09:38.721 --> 09:55.063
discussion

09:38.721 --> 09:55.063
like in ROTC classes.

09:56.495 --> 10:12.650
And a number of the core students during my 
sophomore year were, you know, they were really

09:56.495 --> 10:12.650
expecting to go and

09:56.495 --> 10:12.650
were looking forward to it. I mean, and of course in 
squadrons, well, I think most of the squadrons had

10:12.710 --> 10:23.920
a fair number of students who envisioned 
themselves the pilot of a fighter plane. And the

10:26.522 --> 10:33.409
World War II vats were pretty well gone out of 
school by then. And the large number of them. They

10:34.890 --> 10:36.272
were just occasional ones. And they were very low 
profile for almost always.

10:43.199 --> 10:48.103
What was the status of the various 
extracurricular groups? I'm assuming that the

10:48.904 --> 10:51.607
corps commander was the highest. Yeah. student on 
campus in terms of prestige. What did y'all think

10:58.532 --> 10:59.833
about the band?

11:03.137 --> 11:09.184
Well,

11:03.137 --> 11:09.184
it was held in high regard.

11:12.388 --> 11:15.591
Were there jokes about the band or anything then?

11:18.615 --> 11:19.776
Y'all didn't make fun of them?

11:23.198 --> 11:24.079
What about Yale leaders? Did they have high 
status? Yeah, yeah. What other student

11:29.647 --> 11:33.652
organizations were there with lots of 
credibility? Well, Ross Volunteers, of course,

11:33.992 --> 11:39.380
were very highly regarded.

11:42.063 --> 11:50.995
A

11:42.063 --> 11:50.995
lot of the various clubs were, you know, like the 
FFA, Collegiate Chapter, that for in ag ed, you

11:52.983 --> 12:04.955
know, for that group of people, that was a really a 
pivotal organization. The Agronomy Society.

12:08.859 --> 12:15.606
So a lot of the discipline-oriented 
organizations were. Did you get in one of those?

12:19.791 --> 12:21.893
Was there a pre-vet club or group?

12:24.910 --> 12:27.673
No, well, not to my knowledge. I did not. That came 
along later. Were you aware of the existence of

12:30.716 --> 12:35.741
secret fraternities when you were a student? I had 
heard of the TTs, but I didn't know really very

12:36.242 --> 12:41.187
much. I didn't know any particulars about them. 
Were you aware of anybody that supposedly was a

12:44.310 --> 12:47.033
member? No. Or what they supposedly did? No. All 
right, now during this sophomore year then,

12:53.665 --> 13:00.873
you're headed toward vet school. When do you get, 
when do you apply and get admitted? Well, make

13:05.178 --> 13:11.065
application in the spring after I came back down 
here. I think it would have been probably like

13:11.085 --> 13:18.553
February, something around February. And I, It 
was after

13:23.703 --> 13:30.751
I came back down here that I went to the vet school.

13:34.435 --> 13:40.301
That was the first time I was in the building that's 
been occupied by CE for so long.

13:48.390 --> 13:52.495
The information I got actually was provided by

13:54.955 --> 13:57.017
one of the staff in the dean's office. But I did not 
see Dean Boughton. See, he had his stroke, and so he

14:00.402 --> 14:04.466
was not available. Fred Jagge, I remember being 
introduced to him as the interim dean, but I don't

14:05.087 --> 14:16.621
think he, I'm not sure he officially was that, but 
he functioned that way. But,

14:24.537 --> 14:33.588
I remember turning in my application there at the 
dean's office in the vet school. As far as you were

14:34.449 --> 14:45.723
aware, what kind of academic

14:34.449 --> 14:45.723
requirements were there in terms of GPA and number 
of hours and so forth? How hard was it going to be to

14:45.763 --> 14:47.245
get in? Well, I had heard that it would probably 
take a B average which at that time was a two-point

14:53.157 --> 14:57.242
field.

14:58.884 --> 15:21.291
As it turned out, it didn't take that, but that was a 
scuttlebutt among my classmates, and I just

14:58.884 --> 15:21.291
wasn't sure whether

14:58.884 --> 15:21.291
I'd, because of my irregularities, you know, with 
the problem I had with that organic chemistry

14:58.884 --> 15:21.291
class and the low-grade intrigue, I was very 
concerned about that. Now another course that I

15:23.868 --> 15:34.286
had that was a first of its kind was physics. I was in 
the first class of physics. These were a new

15:39.394 --> 15:46.907
physics course that were presented, started my 
sophomore year, for non-physics majors

15:47.410 --> 16:16.725
principally pre-vets and pre-meds and those type 
people and he was taught by the head of the

15:47.410 --> 16:16.725
department of physics dr potter we call him 
physics potter and that was quite an experience to

15:47.410 --> 16:16.725
me i i did okay in physics but if i'd if i'd had if 
electricity had been a larger part of it, I think I

16:17.937 --> 16:23.165
probably would have flunked the course. I could 
not get that down, get the concept down during the

16:23.265 --> 16:30.115
time I was in that course. Dr.

16:31.217 --> 16:41.752
Potter, bless his heart, he really threw himself 
into the course, developing it. And he wanted to

16:43.896 --> 16:45.598
make it relevant. for the students who were 
taking. He wanted all of us to enjoy and like

16:49.181 --> 16:56.111
physics. That was his goal. And so on the exams, 
since the majority of the students, I think, that

16:59.556 --> 17:12.514
were taking it that first year were pre-vet 
students, so he would write questions He figured a

17:12.832 --> 17:20.879
pre-vet student would identify with and be 
interested in. For example, on resistance, I

17:20.899 --> 17:27.625
remember he had a question. His question had to do 
with, I think, gravity and maybe resistance.

17:36.613 --> 17:41.978
Anyway, it was water swallowed by a giraffe.

17:44.725 --> 17:51.553
And he had a question about an enraged bull, and I 
got tickled with that.

17:54.877 --> 18:08.252
I'm sure I was feeling the pressure, but it just hit 
my funny bone, and I thought I wouldn't finish that

17:54.877 --> 18:08.252
exam every time I'd come to that question on that 
bull.

18:09.329 --> 18:09.830
How long? I'd just lose it. After you applied for 
admission, how long before you heard the result?

18:15.335 --> 18:16.476
Well, we were called in. I don't know if everyone 
was interviewed, but I was called in for

18:17.517 --> 18:20.881
interview. Describe the interview. Oh, me, ooh, 
that was. Who, how long, where? Well, it was in the

18:27.207 --> 18:32.533
dean's office, and Dr. Boughton was back. He was, 
had his cane. B-O-U-G-H? B-O-U, yeah. T-O-N.

18:37.758 --> 18:38.779
Mm-hmm. And Dr. John Miloff,

18:39.923 --> 18:57.001
Dr. Leonard, and

18:39.923 --> 18:57.001
Dr. Jaggi. J-A-G-G-I. Uh-huh. As I remember 
those, I think that was it. And was Boughton

19:04.548 --> 19:07.011
Miloff? Yeah, there were four of them, I think. 
Well, Dr. Bowden was sitting behind his desk over

19:11.581 --> 19:16.347
here. I was sitting just inside the door. And

19:18.990 --> 19:28.342
he was leaning back sort of like this, so he was very 
low profile physically. And the other three, the

19:30.064 --> 19:37.133
three faculty members were sitting in chairs on, 
this side so as the interview developed well they

19:38.463 --> 20:06.411
developed it you know asking for information from 
me and so on and

19:38.463 --> 20:06.411
they asked one of them asked if i knew what bai was

19:38.463 --> 20:06.411
and i I had just heard or read about it not very long 
before Bureau of Animal Industries and so I said

20:07.960 --> 20:37.528
yes and they asked well what is it I told them it's a 
branch of the government and then the next

20:07.960 --> 20:37.528
question well tell us what it does and I was you know 
of course I was wanting to really impress them with

20:37.913 --> 20:41.759
what I knew about it. That's all I knew was that it 
was BAI branch of the government or federal

20:42.220 --> 20:48.590
agency. As it turns out, see at that particular 
time, that was the branch of government in which

20:49.632 --> 20:59.888
disease control was being handled by 
veterinarians. And so it was the agency you went to

20:59.988 --> 21:04.275
work for if you were a veterinarian. I didn't know 
that. So I just sat there trying to think, how do I

21:06.260 --> 21:11.807
answer this without sounding too stupid? And I 
wasn't, I don't know how long it was silent. The

21:17.295 --> 21:24.424
silence was broken by Dr. Boughton slamming his 
cane down on top of the desk. And expletive,

21:25.349 --> 21:29.236
expletive, expletive. You've got to answer 
things. You've got to think on your feet. That's

21:33.623 --> 21:34.264
what he said. You've got to think on your feet, 
young man, if you want to be a veterinarian. And

21:39.813 --> 21:43.339
boy, I don't remember any interview after that. 
And it was over, fortunately, shortly after. Half

21:48.708 --> 21:49.550
hour, hour? Do you have any idea what the length 
was? It would, I think on the order of a half hour

21:51.978 --> 21:55.824
probably. And then how long before you heard the 
result of your application?

22:10.746 --> 22:13.530
I think it was two or three weeks. Phone call, 
letter, what? How'd you? Letter. Letter. Uh-huh.

22:17.926 --> 22:21.290
Did you, what was your guess before you opened it? 
What did you think the result was gonna be? I

22:24.514 --> 22:28.299
figured I probably wasn't gonna get in after all of 
that. And in those days they were admitting how

22:29.160 --> 22:31.002
many? 64. 64, okay. And did you? I was in and 
probably, I don't know what they did with the

22:41.894 --> 22:44.837
interviews. I'm sure, talking with Dr. John in 
years after that, that they had no formal way for

22:44.878 --> 22:58.353
assigning a weight or anything. You could 
probably just out and out disqualify yourself by

22:58.413 --> 23:08.205
doing something really stupid or weird, but I 
don't think That little deficit on my part was

23:10.345 --> 23:20.437
probably, I just provided entertainment for the 
committee probably for the rest of the morning.

23:20.757 --> 23:22.379
Did you do anything to celebrate? Did you make any 
phone calls? I called home. What did mom and dad

23:26.063 --> 23:27.205
say? They were very pleased. And so

23:28.506 --> 23:33.572
then you go home that summer? Yeah, I work in the oil 
field. I'm really pretty motivated at that point.

23:40.501 --> 23:42.183
And you come back then in the fall. And the word had 
gotten around in Winters that I had been admitted

23:42.203 --> 23:47.188
to vet school. I was going to be a veterinarian. And 
that they had a rodeo in Winters that summer. And

23:57.759 --> 24:01.203
not a very big one, but a local rodeo. And in the 
course of events,

24:01.383 --> 24:09.512
they, in, clearing one of the horses that a rider 
had who cleared the bulls out from the arena. That

24:21.814 --> 24:31.585
horse was gored by a bull and his horn went in and 
just kind of went up a rib a little bit and opened up a

24:21.814 --> 24:31.585
pretty nasty looking wound. So I was called with 
much fanfare and that was my first case. trying to

24:40.390 --> 24:43.315
sew up that nasty wound. Right. Then you come back 
that fall. Did you seek anybody's advice or

24:49.284 --> 24:55.133
counsel before coming back to vet school? No. I

24:56.034 --> 25:06.330
didn't know in Winters or in that area. Well, there 
was a veterinarian in Ballinger by the name of

25:07.137 --> 25:24.397
Zedlitz, Dr. Zedlitz, but he was what to me was of 
such ancient years that anything he would have

25:07.137 --> 25:24.397
known wouldn't have been useful to me. You were not 
really acquainted with a veterinarian, were you?

25:27.281 --> 25:28.202
No, not there. I had known a veterinarian, two 
veterinarians in Fisher County, and they had

25:38.373 --> 25:52.648
observing them, a man by the name of Aldridge and a 
man by the name of Sweetwater and a young

25:38.373 --> 25:52.648
veterinarian by the name of Jones in row 10. As you 
were at that point, what did you think you were

25:53.349 --> 26:00.056
going to do as a veterinarian? I was going to large 
animal. See, my decision, the reason I selected

26:07.972 --> 26:21.532
veterinary medicine, I felt that that would 
provide me with a means of livelihood that would be

26:07.972 --> 26:21.532
sufficient that I could buy my own stock farm. I 
wanted to have a stock farm or a ranch. That was my

26:25.117 --> 26:26.599
goal. In that area? In the western part of the 
state, yeah. Well, about west of here, I mean,

26:33.301 --> 26:37.948
central to west Texas. So I was, my thought was 
probably, was mostly large animal, but I, or a

26:40.331 --> 26:48.263
general practice. As far as you knew, did 
veterinarians make good income? I thought they

26:51.969 --> 26:55.234
did, yeah. It seemed to me that they were doing 
pretty well. And the animals that you had cared

27:00.802 --> 27:02.785
for, before that time were on your dad's property 
and a few pets?

27:11.933 --> 27:15.718
Yeah, well, the pets were not of any significance. 
I mean, we had dogs and a cat, but they were just dogs

27:15.758 --> 27:24.149
and cats. I was close with the dogs, but I was very 
successful in high school in swine production and

27:32.752 --> 28:02.286
i had a pretty i grew into a pretty sizable little 
herd of uh or drove of a registered duroc jersey

27:32.752 --> 28:02.286
pigs and started out with a sears pig out of the 
sears program and went on from there and uh so i i was

27:32.752 --> 28:02.286
a serious animal husband just when i was in high 
school i See, when we lived in Brownwood, before I

28:02.722 --> 28:12.615
moved there, my orientation was largely in math. 
And I accelerated, actually, in junior high

28:12.855 --> 28:28.936
school in the program they had in Brownwood and 
took so much of the math that when I got to Robie, I'd

28:12.855 --> 28:28.936
already had all the courses that they taught, that 
they offered. So I went... my junior and senior

28:31.088 --> 28:37.397
year in high school, I had no math, and that was part 
of my problem then when I hit that trig course. I

28:37.437 --> 28:42.405
didn't have a, I'd been away from it a while. When 
you get back that fall to begin vet school. Uh-huh,

28:49.535 --> 28:52.860
I meet one, Alvin A. Price, among others. Describe 
your first impressions of him. Oh, he was about the

29:00.769 --> 29:03.732
slickest thing I'd ever seen. That guy could talk, 
you know, boy, I mean, he was a lecturer and a half.

29:11.159 --> 29:13.021
And very, very impressive. He had a standard first 
lecture, which was a motivational lecture. It's

29:20.167 --> 29:23.050
the sort of lecture that every vet school every vet 
school needs a person to deliver that lecture and

29:23.806 --> 29:53.104
it's got to be a person though that's the teacher of 
the students in that first year and really set them

29:23.806 --> 29:53.104
straight what were the main major points in that 
speech well the uh he was exalting veterinary

29:23.806 --> 29:53.104
medicine as a profession and uh he he started out 
simply by instructing us in the appropriate use of

29:53.928 --> 30:20.408
the word veterinarian versus veterinary and how 
to spell veterinarian six vowels and six

29:53.928 --> 30:20.408
consonants six syllables and except the way he 
said it you know it just registered all of my

29:53.928 --> 30:20.408
classmates to this day you know we mentioned in 
this room just to four or five years ago when I had

30:20.624 --> 30:32.275
the class here, mentioned Al Price and they talk 
about veterinarian, six vowels, six consonants,

30:20.624 --> 30:32.275
six syllables.

30:35.298 --> 30:48.471
But he was dressed impeccably,

30:35.298 --> 30:48.471
very energetic, a very energetic lecturer, very 
knowledgeable of his subjects. And very

30:48.822 --> 30:50.865
demanding of you. I mean, he did not want you to 
miss. He wanted every I dotted, every T crossed.

30:58.837 --> 31:01.701
That was the road to success. And I went into his, 
well, attended his first lecture. I don't

31:07.770 --> 31:17.985
remember in what attire, but I went to the first lab 
on Monday afternoon. with him. This was osteology

31:20.343 --> 31:24.567
lab where we worked with bones.
