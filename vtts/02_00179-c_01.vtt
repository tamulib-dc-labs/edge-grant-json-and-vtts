WEBVTT

00:02.900 --> 00:19.822
A black delegate was going to be coming from to the 
campus and how would the campus react and how could

00:02.900 --> 00:19.822
we prepare for this and so of course all of us on the 
executive committee were in favor of it.

00:25.729 --> 00:30.055
We did not want to publicize it however because We 
didn't want to give any, if there were any

00:30.710 --> 00:46.754
rednecks, we didn't want to give lead time for any 
opposition to form and to create problems or

00:30.710 --> 00:46.754
demonstrations or anything that might bring bad 
attention to A&M. So

00:47.595 --> 00:53.043
we decided we wouldn't publicize it. Nobody would 
say anything other than to make arrangements

00:53.083 --> 00:59.653
behind the scenes.

01:00.325 --> 01:11.479
And I think they had made arrangements for him to 
stay with, I think Wayne or somebody that Wayne

01:00.325 --> 01:11.479
knew had made arrangements for him to stay with 
maybe the black minister in the community. And

01:13.762 --> 01:18.648
then later decided to put him in at the MSC. And it 
all worked out okay. And it all worked out okay.

01:21.772 --> 01:25.337
Well, it did except that on the first day, When all 
the delegates began to arrive and they realized

01:26.330 --> 01:37.622
there was a black delegate there, some of the 
delegates who were our guests wanted to make a real

01:26.330 --> 01:37.622
big deal of it. They wanted to focus on him as if he 
were a celebrity rather than focus on the topic of

01:37.662 --> 01:44.069
SCONA. And we said, no, we don't want to do that. 
Everything's going to be normal. You're not going

01:49.174 --> 01:52.978
to make him a cause celebre. focus on this. And we 
had to do almost some arm twisting and almost

01:55.753 --> 02:07.405
threatened to send some of them home as being 
ungracious guests if they didn't settle down. And

02:07.746 --> 02:17.777
I remember having to talk to some of the delegates 
that wanted to do that, to publicize this, and

02:07.746 --> 02:17.777
telling them, look, we want to set a precedent. We 
want it to go well. We don't want to give an

02:18.838 --> 02:21.801
opposition chance to form. We wanted to do it, 
treat everything as if it's normal, and we'll

02:22.372 --> 02:28.299
publicize it after the fact. You can still get all 
the mileage that you want out of it, but without

02:29.060 --> 02:34.146
creating a big incident. And finally, we 
convinced them, the cooler heads prevail, to not

02:34.166 --> 02:41.235
make this a big thing, and it went well. It was a 
precedent-setting move. What about one or two of

02:44.318 --> 02:47.502
the highlights, the high points? That one ended up 
positively, but some other things that you

02:48.190 --> 02:54.124
remember being very proud of in your Scona 
leadership years? We initiated

02:55.908 --> 03:07.093
what we called at the time cultural leadership 
activities. Wayne and one of his assistants named

03:07.597 --> 03:12.223
Bill Height and I went down to Houston. We met with 
John Lindsay, we met with Nina Vance at the Alley

03:12.263 --> 03:27.782
Theater, we met with a number of folks, the 
director of the Houston Symphony Orchestra, I

03:12.263 --> 03:27.782
don't remember that name right now, but What we 
wanted to do was to have a cultural weekend with

03:29.078 --> 03:43.740
selected student leaders on campus being invited 
to go by invitation, not by volunteer group,

03:29.078 --> 03:43.740
because we knew it had to be, especially 
initially, had to be a small control group. And we

03:45.382 --> 03:47.566
did that in Houston, and that one went well. So the 
next year, we did one in Dallas, including the, we

03:47.606 --> 03:57.921
timed it for the opera, Dallas opera season. and uh 
and that kicked off it took hold and it's been going

03:58.323 --> 04:25.630
ever since and it's now called spring leadership 
it has it has evolved some in selection criteria

03:58.323 --> 04:25.630
and what they do and where they go but basically 
that was initiated in 60 61

03:58.323 --> 04:25.630
or 62. the second one was the msc travel committee

04:27.601 --> 04:31.812
And this was one of Wayne's brainstorms. He 
probably got the idea from some of his association

04:32.874 --> 04:43.922
conferences with other student union leaders, 
but the idea was to publicize and attract and

04:44.527 --> 05:00.325
motivate students to want to go any kind of an 
overseas experience so we got a lot of literature

04:44.527 --> 05:00.325
on things like the experiment international 
living uh... this operation crossroads and any

05:00.305 --> 05:07.273
other kinds of activities that would facilitate 
and just publicize opportunities. And then the

05:07.333 --> 05:12.500
students, of course, would have to volunteer and 
sometimes raise money and pay for them

05:07.333 --> 05:12.500
themselves. But it was a great experience. Well, 
that first year, I got caught up with the publicity

05:14.182 --> 05:18.607
and what we're doing. That's when I signed up for 
that Operation Crossroads to East Africa.

05:25.904 --> 05:41.445
Reggie Richardson, who was the deputy corps 
commander, was the first chairman of the Travel

05:25.904 --> 05:41.445
Committee and he got all the information, all the 
publicity together and helped facilitate this.

05:41.505 --> 05:47.794
We had four people, two of us went on Operation 
Crossroads and two to experiment international

05:41.505 --> 05:47.794
living. And then the next year, there were several 
more. And then my brother, who came in as a freshman

05:53.210 --> 06:01.702
the year I graduated, we overlapped there in the 
fall of 63.

06:04.907 --> 06:10.134
But he eventually became active in the MSC. And I 
think he was a travel committee chairman. And he

06:12.598 --> 06:16.363
went to Switzerland with the experiment in 
international living. as a result of that. So he

06:18.688 --> 06:22.835
was also in Hellcat 9. Do you realize now in looking 
back that your MSC activities were important to

06:24.037 --> 06:29.647
your development? Oh, absolutely. Absolutely. 
That was, I think it was all, it all contributed.

06:39.523 --> 06:42.368
But I would say Those three years as the Great 
Issues Committee Chairman and as Vice President

06:43.934 --> 07:07.377
and as President of the MSC Council and 
Directorate, probably if I had to give the key, the

06:43.934 --> 07:07.377
top among a lot of different influences and 
developmental high points, that would have to

06:43.934 --> 07:07.377
rate at the top. Let's see, I'm looking at lesser 
matters here. Describe going to an Aggie

07:13.203 --> 07:16.248
basketball game in those years. I

07:18.771 --> 07:23.518
went to several of them. I had played basketball in 
high school, but we were in G. Raleigh White.

07:35.616 --> 07:36.537
And it was crowded. It was, no, not very crowded. 
No, there was plenty of space available for

07:39.920 --> 07:47.448
basketball games even then. I think you said that 
tongue in cheek, didn't you? I don't think I ever

07:52.634 --> 07:58.940
went to a basketball game in G. Raleigh-White 
where it was a packed house. Because I don't think

07:58.961 --> 08:03.165
during my four years there,

08:05.828 --> 08:10.814
I don't think we ever even got into Southwest 
Conference playoffs. And so, although, I'm

08:10.834 --> 08:16.681
trying to think who the coach was. Was it Shelby 
Metcalf there that early? Shelby was an assistant

08:19.044 --> 08:22.027
coach then, Bob Rogers. Bob Rogers, okay, I 
remember that name. And the change would have come

08:24.690 --> 08:28.755
at about your senior year, somewhere about that 
time. 63 or 64, maybe, yeah, okay. But that was...

08:36.406 --> 08:51.428
you know that the team was good and I knew some of the 
guys I knew you know Jerry Windham and Lee Walker

08:36.406 --> 08:51.428
and Jim Keller were some of the guys on the team that 
uh... but I didn't know any of them really well oh

08:36.406 --> 08:51.428
Louis Qualls the guy was I knew him because he was 
from Smiley and when I was in high school I played

08:51.408 --> 09:19.795
against him and when Conroe played Smiley I was 
assigned to guard Lewis Qualls and here I was about

08:51.408 --> 09:19.795
at that time about five ten or five eleven and he's 
like six ten or six eleven and after the game you

08:51.408 --> 09:19.795
know the folks were in high school were you know 
kind of consoling me about how well, how hard I

09:20.095 --> 09:22.879
tried and how well I'd tried. I'd fouled out early 
in the fourth quarter because I was trying too

09:22.939 --> 09:50.018
aggressively to keep him from getting the ball and 
try to guard him and they were trying to console me

09:22.939 --> 09:50.018
and so I told him, I said, I told Lewis once when we 
were standing side by side on the free throw line at

09:22.939 --> 09:50.018
one time, I told him, I said, if he didn't behave and 
quit pushing me around, I was going to punch him

09:22.939 --> 09:50.018
right in the knee. But he was a tall drink of water.

09:56.034 --> 10:01.259
What other student organizations had a high 
profile during that time other than the Corps and

09:56.034 --> 10:01.259
the MSC? What about singing cadets? Singing 
cadets were very popular. They were still fairly

10:07.385 --> 10:12.311
early in their growth cycle. You may happen to know 
what year Bob Boone started. I don't know if it was

10:18.223 --> 10:21.450
59 or 60 or 61. It was fairly early. He was new and he 
was building and I don't know who his predecessor

10:24.397 --> 10:36.643
was or if he had a predecessor but it was building 
but it was still very impressive then we always

10:37.096 --> 10:39.218
enjoyed hearing them sing. What about Yale 
leaders? How much prestige did Yale leaders have?

10:43.762 --> 10:45.224
They had a lot. Probably, they were probably, 
because they were more visible, they probably had

10:45.324 --> 11:06.343
more prestige and influence than student body 
presidents or MSC council presidents or I think

10:45.324 --> 11:06.343
that because they were so visible at football 
games, they probably, I think they and the corps

10:45.324 --> 11:06.343
commanders in fact they probably even had more 
more visibility and prestige even than the corps

11:07.943 --> 11:34.963
commander did as far as uh because you know at the 
yell leader at the yell practices over in the grove

11:07.943 --> 11:34.963
and at the games themselves the head yell leader 
and the yell leaders were up you know that they were

11:07.943 --> 11:34.963
up rallying the troops and telling the fables and 
leading the yells and everything so with the the

11:07.943 --> 11:34.963
other folks you're more behind the scenes and 
don't have the the visibility or the publicity

11:35.399 --> 11:38.122
that the Yale leaders did. Did you know that secret 
fraternities existed? I did not. I have heard in

11:44.407 --> 11:47.870
subsequent years that some did. I was never 
invited to join one and actually was kind of

11:47.890 --> 12:03.685
revolted at the idea of secret fraternities 
because to me that smacks of elitism. For sure,

12:04.171 --> 12:13.667
maybe it's a way of networking and a way of 
maneuvering yourself and your buddies into

12:04.171 --> 12:13.667
positions of power and influence, but I don't like 
that. I prefer a meritocracy where people can, by

12:13.747 --> 12:30.094
their talent and their hustle and their 
leadership, I just think it's easier to sustain

12:13.747 --> 12:30.094
that, whereas if a secret cabal is holding you in 
place, and you're dependent more on them than you

12:31.492 --> 12:50.648
are on the facts and genuinely polling and leading 
public opinion to help you, you can maneuver

12:31.492 --> 12:50.648
yourself into some pretty untenable positions 
and then you either have to

12:51.995 --> 13:11.990
have your cabal artificially hold you in place or 
else you kind of go down in flames and disgrace with

12:51.995 --> 13:11.990
nobody supporting you publicly because if your 
cabal comes out to support you then they identify

12:51.995 --> 13:11.990
themselves and I just don't like that system and 
yet I kind of suspect some of that might still be

12:51.995 --> 13:11.990
going on. You did know about steam tunnels. Yep. 
Did you ever go down in the steam? Absolutely. When

13:18.018 --> 13:25.305
we were, again, my freshman year, when we were over 
in dorm seven, from the back of the dorm, you could

13:18.018 --> 13:25.305
see the band hall. And the band had abused us on one 
occasion. We had done very well that semester with

13:32.751 --> 13:44.682
some of the, well, the previous week had done well 
at a march off and had won it. and had beaten either

13:45.877 --> 13:50.062
one of their units or one of their favorites. And 
maybe there might have been some personal

13:51.323 --> 14:06.359
rivalries between some of our upperclassmen and 
some of them, but at any rate, during a march-off,

13:51.323 --> 14:06.359
there's a way you can do an offbeat roll-off 
between songs. The drummers will roll, and if they

14:08.161 --> 14:12.846
intend to do this, They'll roll and then start the 
next song one beat early which means that you're on

14:13.282 --> 14:20.819
the wrong foot as you come by. And they did that to us 
as we were approaching the reviewing stand. and as

14:26.765 --> 14:46.731
a result we had some guys you know we'd been told if 
that happens you just continue you don't do a

14:26.765 --> 14:46.731
change step you just continue and you shift to the 
right foot well some of the few of the guys didn't

14:26.765 --> 14:46.731
remember that or were confused and they were used 
to hitting the beat on the left foot so they changed

14:26.765 --> 14:46.731
step others didn't and so here we are out of sync as 
we go by the reviewing stand. So we get a bad grade

14:50.295 --> 14:52.779
that week. Well, we seethe and simmer about that a 
little bit and we decide we're going to flood the

14:52.980 --> 14:59.331
band dorm. And so we did some intelligence 
collection. We got in the steam tunnels. Earl

15:06.583 --> 15:10.710
Henderson and I again were, in fact Earl drew up the 
the ops plan the sequencing of events and the

15:10.825 --> 15:35.483
timing and everything and we did the recon 
ordering in there knowing where found in the steam

15:10.825 --> 15:35.483
tunnels most of the the valves the wheels on the 
valves had been removed so you just had the stem

15:10.825 --> 15:35.483
coming out with the little square thing on it but it 
was to prevent the tampering with it but we had

15:10.825 --> 15:35.483
found one and had stored it in our room And so we had a 
way to turn the main valve. So we knew then, once we

15:39.983 --> 15:47.113
had found that, we knew we could do it if the guys 
didn't get caught. So one day at noon, we had some

15:47.193 --> 16:04.018
fish dressed up as sophomores, and they were 
wearing their hats and wearing the slick black

15:47.193 --> 16:04.018
belt and the black braid so they could go in and 
disguise themselves. And in case anybody was left

16:04.235 --> 16:13.688
in the dorm, well, sure enough, there was a guy in 
the dorm and he didn't go to chow with them. and they

16:15.355 --> 16:43.658
said well we're up here we're looking for Fish 
Rabel or uh... uh... or uh... we're looking for

16:15.355 --> 16:43.658
Chip Rabel who was a sophomore this was a fish but it 
was from the same hometown from Spring Branch knew

16:15.355 --> 16:43.658
a name to drop and he said he said well you won't find 
him uh... he said he's at Chow and besides well he

16:15.355 --> 16:43.658
wouldn't why would you expect him to be here during 
Chow he said well we were supposed to meet him and

16:15.355 --> 16:43.658
uh... we're running late we thought he might have 
waited for us and so anyway the guy went on back into

16:15.355 --> 16:43.658
his room and then later on got a little bit 
suspicious, but by this time, that group

16:43.739 --> 16:51.612
retreated. We had a group going to every floor, 
every bathroom, taking the heads off of the flush

16:52.013 --> 17:04.414
toilets

16:52.013 --> 17:04.414
after the water was turned off. and they got those 
well that group didn't do theirs but the other see

17:04.462 --> 17:25.812
two four six we got seven out of eight of the 
bathrooms done I was in the steam tunnel with the

17:04.462 --> 17:25.812
wheel and as the last guy left on his way out of the 
building he gave the secret knock on the door and

17:04.462 --> 17:25.812
turned the valve and then beat feet back through 
and get to our dorm and then we're in that window

17:26.433 --> 17:39.919
looking out that back window to see what the 
reaction was and just as those guys were leaving

17:26.433 --> 17:39.919
the guy who had been contacted had second thoughts 
and he thought something's happening and he went

17:40.844 --> 18:03.628
out and as he was going out the door he was headed out 
the door to sound a warning when the flood started

17:40.844 --> 18:03.628
and so they they reacted pretty quickly because he 
ran right across there to the chow hall and then all

17:40.844 --> 18:03.628
the band people ran back so there was a good 
indo-chinese fire drill there i need to quit

17:40.844 --> 18:03.628
because i got to be at him okay
