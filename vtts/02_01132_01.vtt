WEBVTT

00:03.642 --> 00:13.494
My

00:03.642 --> 00:13.494
name is Tim Welbes, and I'm 44 years old. I'm the 
Senior Vice President of Residential Operations

00:13.954 --> 00:17.438
for the Woodlands. I grew up in Houston, Texas. My 
folks moved there in the very early 50s. And I went

00:25.127 --> 00:33.177
to St. Thomas High School, graduated from 
University of Houston with a business degree. I

00:34.152 --> 00:40.498
went to work at Ernst & Ernst on the audit staff. I 
worked in public accounting for about six or seven

00:40.619 --> 00:43.902
years. One of our tax clients was a home builder on 
the west side of Houston named John Pace.

00:53.892 --> 01:02.961
He made more money than Leon Jaworski and all of us 
young accountants and taxmen were very impressed

00:53.892 --> 01:02.961
with that.

01:03.245 --> 01:13.034
got to a stage in my career where I knew that public 
accounting was not where I wanted to spend my

01:03.245 --> 01:13.034
career or my life for another moment and got out of 
it. Were you a CPA? Yes. You were a serious

01:14.516 --> 01:15.757
accountant? I was serious. I was CPA. I was 
certified. I'd spent several years on the audit

01:18.380 --> 01:26.287
staff and several years in tax and had gotten a wide 
exposure to a lot of different corporations. And

01:26.668 --> 01:30.231
one of the things that I realized about myself was 
that one, I enjoyed selling very much and dealing

01:30.937 --> 01:43.090
with people and dealing with current events as 
opposed to the public accounting sort of business

01:30.937 --> 01:43.090
which is dealing with history. And the other thing 
that I wanted to do was to get involved in some

01:43.110 --> 01:57.366
business or some enterprise that dealt with 
people making an important decision as opposed to

01:43.110 --> 01:57.366
perhaps a retail operation where you sell 
hundreds or thousands of transactions a day or a

01:58.477 --> 02:03.642
week, but it may not be a significant one. And 
residential real estate is one that deals with

02:04.522 --> 02:10.067
significant transactions for the home buyer. 
Now, by significant, you mean, I

02:11.969 --> 02:17.814
don't want to put words in your mouth. Sure. But are 
you saying that one of your motivations was, in

02:17.975 --> 02:23.920
fact, I'm not really just interested in making 
money. I also want to make a difference. Am I

02:26.222 --> 02:27.403
reading what you're saying? well in selling and 
like all sales people i think psychologically

02:29.628 --> 02:55.011
what you're after is you want that customer to buy 
from you because that's a form of their acceptance

02:29.628 --> 02:55.011
of you and i think as a motivation i feel that and 
felt that i didn't want them to buy my product

02:56.324 --> 03:00.468
and be successful selling mobile phones or car 
telephones or something else. I wanted to be

03:00.549 --> 03:09.979
successful in selling them a product that was 
going to be an important purchase for them,

03:00.549 --> 03:09.979
something that would be meaningful. And the 
residential home sales business was one that was

03:09.999 --> 03:18.588
exciting in Houston in the 70s and more exciting 
now. I understand that, but what I don't

03:18.628 --> 03:21.331
understand is why you felt that way. I don't know. I 
just felt it. I don't know. I just felt it. It just

03:25.810 --> 03:28.514
felt good. So in a roundabout way, I eventually was 
hired by John Pace to go to work for him as a

03:29.595 --> 03:40.471
salesman, and then to put together a sales and 
marketing department. And as it turned out, he was

03:40.612 --> 03:46.580
bought out by a Canadian developer, a small 
developer. And I got to run that home building

03:47.422 --> 03:50.947
company for about two years. And in 81, Like many 
other highly leveraged developers who were

03:53.530 --> 04:04.101
dealing with prime at 21%, you can't make enough 
money to stay in business. I resigned and went to

04:05.382 --> 04:13.851
work for Standard Pacific Homes, which is a New 
York stock exchange company. The PACE operation

04:15.372 --> 04:20.938
was one that dealt with primarily custom homes. 
Standard Pacific, on the other hand, dealt with

04:21.475 --> 04:32.729
what's called a production home building 
operation, wherein you have a very limited menu of

04:21.475 --> 04:32.729
floor plans, perhaps five or six for a given 
subdivision. You'll do two or three models.

04:36.254 --> 04:38.016
You'll sell out of the model homes. And Standard 
Pacific was in an exciting growth mode. They were

04:43.322 --> 04:50.892
adding eight, nine, 10 subdivisions in the total 
Houston area, had some 40 some odd employees. And I

04:51.378 --> 04:54.703
came on board as VP Sales and Marketing for them. 
About a year and a half later, they removed the

04:54.743 --> 05:01.573
Houston division manager. And I was fortunate 
enough to replace him. And in that position and in

05:05.899 --> 05:19.579
the 82, 83 period,

05:05.899 --> 05:19.579
I knew that Standard Pacific, for their own 
well-being, needed to get into the major master

05:05.899 --> 05:19.579
plan communities in Houston. The only one they 
were in was First Colony. And so I was proceeding to

05:22.068 --> 05:27.235
contact friends with them. Why did you know

05:27.255 --> 05:32.261
that? What I knew about new home sales at that time 
told me that the market was nowhere near as good as

05:32.281 --> 05:42.135
the sales numbers reflected. And in effect, what 
was happening at that time, mortgage rates might

05:42.235 --> 05:48.283
have been 14%. The new home builders were buying 
down mortgages to the 8%, 9%, 10% mortgage rate.

05:57.851 --> 06:12.506
And the way you do that is the builder prepays 5, 10, 
15 points and provides the home purchaser, if you

05:57.851 --> 06:12.506
will, the home buyer signs a contract for $70,000. 
He's getting a $60,000 house. but there's $10,000

06:17.052 --> 06:19.974
worth of finance built into the price. So what we 
were doing, obviously, was stealing from the

06:21.035 --> 06:30.223
resale market because the resale seller could not 
go out and provide the kind of financing. And so we

06:30.804 --> 06:34.207
were selling to a market that really wasn't there. 
Also, just in paying attention to the financial

06:35.668 --> 06:46.637
markets and what oil was doing and Houston was into 
a collapsing mode, it was clear that or it appeared

06:46.938 --> 07:03.458
to me that the

06:46.938 --> 07:03.458
less well-planned or the less sized communities 
would be the first to start feeling the sales stop.

07:03.618 --> 07:05.721
Because it would be less marketable? There was 
just less demand. There were too many empty houses

07:07.383 --> 07:10.467
appearing, too many people leaving town.

07:14.452 --> 07:15.493
You just... You just sensed that in the 
marketplace, the very good would survive. But

07:20.837 --> 07:32.354
anything that was marginal to marginally good 
would probably take it on the chin, and the sales

07:20.837 --> 07:32.354
would decline there much more steeply than they 
would in the better, bigger communities. So in

07:32.795 --> 07:44.012
that context of trying to get standard Pacific 
homes into the woodlands, I met Roger Gladys and Ed

07:32.795 --> 07:44.012
Lee, and

07:32.795 --> 07:44.012
they then had a situation internally where VP 
Sales, Marketing, Residential transferred to

07:45.680 --> 08:10.675
the Commercial Division and I had interviewed 
with Joe Collard, Spencer Stewart, former M&D

07:45.680 --> 08:10.675
Human Resources Executive on another matter and 
unbeknownst to me the opening in the Woodlands had

07:45.680 --> 08:10.675
occurred and then Joe Collard called me and asked 
if we could talk about a position with the

08:11.077 --> 08:17.406
Development Corporation. And at the time, in 
1985, I think my family was comprised of a

08:17.426 --> 08:26.520
four-year-old, a three-year-old, a 
one-year-old, and my wife was pregnant. She was

08:27.662 --> 08:28.783
from Minnesota. The woods in the woodlands were 
beautiful.

08:33.370 --> 08:37.877
It was a point in time in my residential home 
building career that I felt I had learned a lot from

08:38.380 --> 08:43.407
the custom program with John Pace. I'd learned a 
lot in the production home building side of it from

08:43.427 --> 08:47.152
Standard Pacific. But I'd never dealt with 
residential development and the work that the

08:48.715 --> 08:57.026
developer does and how you put together a 
community and plan and build lots. And I had always

08:57.087 --> 09:03.055
dealt with the retail level of selling the home to 
the home buyer.

09:07.102 --> 09:13.650
Personally, I was looking at raising the family in 
the Westheimer, Derry-Ashford area. And if you

09:14.131 --> 09:20.059
contrast that as a neighborhood for your kids to 
grow up versus the Woodlands, it's pretty much a

09:14.131 --> 09:20.059
no-brainer. The Woodlands is pretty attractive. 
And we made that move in 85. Standard Pacific is

09:26.126 --> 09:28.209
alive and well in Houston. They're still trying to 
get into the Woodlands, but the Woodlands still

09:28.750 --> 09:34.577
doesn't have room for them. And I have very much 
enjoyed the chance to come here and learn about the

09:35.283 --> 09:38.966
development side. And in that sense, my hopes were 
fulfilled that I've learned a lot about the

09:38.986 --> 10:03.028
development business, but I've also learned

09:38.986 --> 10:03.028
from the inside how the Woodlands continued to,

09:38.986 --> 10:03.028
and at the time they had just had an article in Money 
Magazine, called a pocket of prosperity, because

10:03.397 --> 10:14.831
within Houston and the decline that everybody was 
aware of, the Woodlands stood out and was

10:03.397 --> 10:14.831
recognized nationally. And for those of us at that 
time who were outside the Woodlands and just in the

10:14.911 --> 10:28.948
Houston area, one would remark to another that the 
Woodlands is constantly breaking new ground,

10:29.384 --> 10:44.241
doing something new that's a very active, 
creative, happening kind of place, which seems to

10:29.384 --> 10:44.241
have its air of pending success and some 
ever-building critical mass. And it just looked

10:44.342 --> 10:58.378
like a great place to build homes or live in if you 
just could work out a situation that would allow

10:44.342 --> 10:58.378
you to live there and coordinate that with your 
workplace, and I was delighted with the chance to

10:58.544 --> 11:03.090
come up here. So that was in 85? Yeah. Because that 
was hard times, too. That was the beginning of hard

11:06.774 --> 11:08.677
times. Because the Woodlands enjoyed success 
only, well, in a relative sense. Correct.

11:15.485 --> 11:17.147
Compared to what was going on everywhere else. 
Correct, correct. It was very relative. Within

11:20.131 --> 11:28.281
the Woodlands, once I got here,

11:20.131 --> 11:28.281
I think in that year, and this is... When

11:29.729 --> 11:41.369
I arrived here, or in 1985, I think we sold 
somewhere in the vicinity of 400 houses that year.

11:42.491 --> 11:53.610
And

11:42.491 --> 11:53.610
just in strategizing about what to do with 
residential for the woodland's sake, and talking

11:54.383 --> 12:02.592
with experts in the business, it was clear that the 
Houston market was not going to be the source of

11:54.383 --> 12:02.592
homebuyers. And that if there was going to be any 
success in new housing, it would have to come from

12:03.593 --> 12:14.944
dealing with out-of-town buyers who were coming 
to Houston. Was that a conscious marketing?

12:17.227 --> 12:17.827
Definitely. Very conscious decision to focus on 
the out-of-town buyer. In the past, in the late

12:23.729 --> 12:26.833
70s, early 80s, everybody took it for granted. I 
think the magazine Texas Monthly article talked

12:27.554 --> 12:35.904
about 365 cars a day being added to the traffic 
count in Houston. And the out-of-town market was

12:35.924 --> 12:38.587
just like the humidity. It was just part of 
Houston. You took it for granted. But in the

12:42.852 --> 12:49.500
mid-80s, when the market declined and Houston was 
shrinking back,

12:51.016 --> 12:55.162
There was, as has been characterized, the flight 
to quality. And a whole lot of factors started

12:56.343 --> 13:02.191
moving in the Woodlands' favor in the 85, 86 
period. Some of them were external, some were

13:04.714 --> 13:06.857
internal. The internal factors that we undertook 
were to take one of the ladies from the information

13:07.698 --> 13:17.732
center and create a residential marketing 
position whose function would be to go out and deal

13:18.320 --> 13:44.682
with any company relocating people to Houston or 
any company who announced the hiring of employees

13:18.320 --> 13:44.682
to make sure that their human resources director 
or the realtor that they chose to help their

13:18.320 --> 13:44.682
employee would have our full complement of 
brochures and videotapes and so on and so forth.

13:45.067 --> 13:47.289
Was that a success? Yes. A measurable success in 
that five years ago or so, I think 35% to 40% of our

13:48.571 --> 14:05.128
new home sales involved what's called a 
third-party broker or a realtor who got the co-op

13:48.571 --> 14:05.128
commission for bringing the buyer to the 
Woodlands. Today, in the custom homes, it's

14:05.148 --> 14:08.172
around 88%. I think Woodlands-wide, it runs 
around 75% to 80% involved a third-party realtor.

14:14.750 --> 14:24.184
An external factor that was also taking place was 
the realty companies were forming reload

14:14.750 --> 14:24.184
directors. And we naturally... But you had 
already beat that trend. Well, we were parallel

14:32.818 --> 14:36.924
with it. In other words, we said, how can we get to 
the out-of-town buyer? The answer was, get with

14:41.451 --> 14:43.474
the realtor. The realtor community said, how can 
we get to the out-of-town buyer? They took a look at

14:48.230 --> 15:07.433
their staff or hired an outsider and said, we want 
this particular person to be the representative

14:48.230 --> 15:07.433
of Henry S. Miller or Coldwell Banker to go to these 
employers and let them know that Henry S. Miller

14:48.230 --> 15:07.433
will be the best broker for them to deal with. And 
another external factor was the constriction in

15:12.108 --> 15:13.931
the oil patch. And what was happening was the 
various oil companies headquartered in Houston

15:14.151 --> 15:29.892
would shut down a satellite office in Midland or 
Denver or wherever and reduce the staff but retain

15:14.151 --> 15:29.892
a few key people and transfer them back to Houston. 
And so we had our representative, the realty

15:30.473 --> 15:39.786
companies, and the reload director within the 
realty company going to those oil-related

15:40.036 --> 15:53.695
employers to assist them in getting their 
employee moved many times back to Houston, or at

15:40.036 --> 15:53.695
least transferred back to the home office in 
Houston. Another external factor was that the

15:55.097 --> 16:09.216
Coldwell Banker and the major national realty 
companies would go to an Anadarko or an Enron or

15:55.097 --> 16:09.216
Chevron Any of these other, Enron, for example, 
was one that moved many, many people from

16:09.618 --> 16:14.262
Nebraska. Well, a major realty company would go to 
Enron and say, especially if Enron was going to

16:15.003 --> 16:31.618
accommodate the purchase of their old home in 
Nebraska, and say, let Coal Banker handle this for

16:15.003 --> 16:31.618
you. In other words, we will come to you, Enron, and 
let you know what the home in Nebraska is worth and

16:32.178 --> 16:39.625
how much you ought to pay on your guaranteed 
buyout. In the meantime, when they get off the

16:40.094 --> 16:46.963
plane in Houston, one of our agents will be there to 
assist them in finding a home in the Houston area.

16:47.744 --> 16:51.609
And a move is traumatic. A move, when you've had 
friends and coworkers laid off, is even more

16:51.629 --> 16:56.755
traumatic. And everybody in the oil patch 
wondered if this move was their last move, or would

16:56.855 --> 17:02.402
they be pink-slipped as well. And there's a lot of 
anxiety. So a lot of that- Driving in Houston

17:04.124 --> 17:07.789
intercontinental is traumatic. I mean, I don't 
want to knock our freeways, because they've

17:08.157 --> 17:11.400
improved dramatically. But coming from 
especially Enron was a good example, where those

17:12.762 --> 17:20.970
people had never, ever moved before. Some of the 
people had been employed at one location for 18,

17:22.472 --> 17:32.522
20, 23 years, and then they were told, your job is 
moving to Houston. If you want to keep it, you're

17:32.542 --> 17:35.785
going to move too. Those folks take a lot of tender, 
loving care, more so than a grizzled veteran who's

17:36.592 --> 17:46.623
transferred every two to five years and just knows 
it's a fact of life. So all of that was going on

17:47.304 --> 17:49.707
externally. This third party thing also meant, 
who was this individual incidentally? Wanda

17:52.990 --> 17:54.031
Mason. Is she still doing it? She has now got one 
child in college and came to me and said, I really

17:55.333 --> 18:04.523
need to go sell custom homes in the woodlands 
because I need to make more money. And she's at the

18:09.168 --> 18:11.530
Custom Home Sales Office right now. And

18:11.930 --> 18:19.377
we've replaced her with another lady. Melissa 
Budacali is now handling that for us. And to

18:23.541 --> 18:35.151
generally characterize the last half of the 80s, 
what happened was the out-of-town market became

18:23.541 --> 18:35.151
two-thirds of our home sales. And as we grew from 
four to five to six to eight to this year, 1990,

18:35.873 --> 18:45.765
we've closed the year with 901 new home sales. As 
that sales rate has increased every year, this

18:46.626 --> 18:56.038
out-of-towner factor of being around 65% has held 
pretty constant. But

18:56.058 --> 19:02.185
before I get into what has happened in the last two 
years, the last part of the 80s, let me talk about

19:02.367 --> 19:09.594
some of the internal things we did. And a lot of it is 
thanks to the talent that Wanda brought to the job.

19:20.584 --> 19:30.433
We found out that, this goes back to 85 when I got 
here, that many realtors were very uncomfortable

19:30.852 --> 19:32.614
trying to show homes in the woodlands.

19:36.938 --> 19:43.145
The efforts that we put into saving the trees makes 
it very difficult to remember which corner you're

19:36.938 --> 19:43.145
at. And as a result, they would come in, they would 
get lost. Oh, yeah. That's still the case. Another

19:48.711 --> 20:00.623
factor is that our design and plan, which calls for 
all price ranges of housing to be in each village,

20:01.733 --> 20:08.226
created a problem for the realtor, which I was 
unaware of until I just sat down and started

20:01.733 --> 20:08.226
talking to a few of them. And I said, well, the 
problem is that when a home buyer comes in and says,

20:08.246 --> 20:18.245
I want to see homes between 90 and 100, or pick a 
range, they go to their MLS computer. Do you want

20:19.047 --> 20:20.470
all of this detail? Yeah, no, this is useful. OK. So 
the key to us was to find a way to communicate with

20:24.464 --> 20:30.373
the realtors and get them comfortable here. They 
had several problems. One, they got lost. Two,

20:33.017 --> 20:42.771
because of our village concept where we have all 
price ranges,

20:33.017 --> 20:42.771
I would think the low end would be excited about 
that. The high end would say, this isn't so

20:42.811 --> 20:44.994
wonderful.

20:49.922 --> 20:52.986
If you go to the information center and see the 
film, we will disarm a lot of that kind of economic

20:53.590 --> 21:12.392
bigotry if you will and

20:53.590 --> 21:12.392
it it somehow dissolves as a problem and I mean we do 
have But, yeah. You have $400,000. Is it? Well,

21:15.600 --> 21:16.961
it's... I mean, ever since I was little, I was told 
that you buy the cheapest house in the

21:17.021 --> 21:21.285
neighborhood. Yes. You know, for economic... 
Yes. Yeah, I mean, that just makes sense. I

21:24.088 --> 21:24.348
understand. You don't get the most expensive 
thing in the neighborhood because you'll never

21:24.368 --> 21:28.392
get your money out of it. I understand. We do not 
have, or certainly none of the appraisers will

21:29.293 --> 21:40.624
tell you that a given $100,000, $200,000, 
$300,000, or $400,000 home...

21:42.157 --> 21:50.306
in the woodlands anywhere is devalued because of 
the proximity to another home near it. But that's a

21:51.667 --> 21:54.710
real estate anomaly that exists in the woodlands. 
No question about it. No question about it. But

21:57.573 --> 22:10.527
going back to our problems with realtors, if you go 
to the MLS machine and call up every for sale home

21:57.573 --> 22:10.527
between 90 and 100, it'll start out at 100. 99, 98, 
97, 96 on down sequentially. The realtor who would

22:15.513 --> 22:22.521
take that list and go to the first home may go to 
Grogan's Mill Village. The second home may be 20

22:23.122 --> 22:28.488
minutes away in Cochran's Crossing. The third 
home may be 15 minutes away in Panther Creek. And

22:33.974 --> 22:34.995
there are Their offhand calloused reply was, I 
don't show in the woodlands. I get lost. I spend too

22:43.149 --> 22:55.120
much time driving from house to house because you 
don't have all your homes like priced in a

22:43.149 --> 22:55.120
convenient area where I can show every home in one 
price range in a few minutes. So I mean, all of this

22:56.221 --> 23:01.866
is very simple, but it was very profound at the 
time. The one thing that every realtor tends to

23:03.187 --> 23:05.910
have is a key map We went down to the key map company. 
I happen to have this in front of me here. I'll

23:10.253 --> 23:11.674
mention it while you're sitting here. What we did 
was to go to key map and said, we want a key map of the

23:12.155 --> 23:19.562
woodlands with your very same grid, your very same 
indexing. And what we would really like is to make

23:19.983 --> 23:26.269
the page about a quarter of an inch wider than 
normal and put the woodlands on the tab. That way,

23:26.309 --> 23:36.319
when we go to realtor conventions or we have open 
houses, they can simply put this little tabular

23:26.309 --> 23:36.319
key map in there ring binder, and suddenly they 
have a key map of the woodlands. You paid for that?

23:41.081 --> 23:41.842
We pay for it. We give it out annually. We do, much 
like the National Association of Home Builders,

23:43.043 --> 23:49.929
Houston has a Houston realtor rally. It brings in 
10,000 realtors every year. From that, Wanda came

23:54.113 --> 24:01.339
to me and said, we need to do a woodlands realtor 
rally and get everything in the woodlands in one

23:54.113 --> 24:01.339
place. The country club, the YMCA, the schools, 
the shopping, everybody. We'll have all the

24:06.590 --> 24:09.633
realtors that we can invite come out. They'll 
learn everything in one-stop shopping, and it's

24:10.234 --> 24:20.684
been a great success and grown from probably 100 to 
700 or 800 this year came out. And we'll give them an

24:20.704 --> 24:22.866
updated key map. The other thing we told them was 
that they are welcome in the woodlands, and if they

24:23.306 --> 24:34.217
will come to the information center while their 
home buyer sees the film, we will then give them $10

24:34.771 --> 24:37.274
or $20 gift certificate for lunch. In the 
meantime, going back to that MLS printout, we

24:38.255 --> 24:44.623
said, bring your printout in. Even though you know 
we want to sell a new house, because we make money

24:45.884 --> 24:53.653
selling the lots, we want you to be comfortable in 
the woodlands. Here's a map to assist you when you

24:54.454 --> 24:57.758
navigate the woodlands. And our staff at the 
Information Center will take your MLS printout

24:58.126 --> 25:07.760
and tell you, of the 10 homes you have listed, one, 
five, and nine are right side by side. Two, four,

25:08.321 --> 25:11.286
six, 10 are over here in this village. And we'll 
prioritize your trip, save you some time. And one

25:14.290 --> 25:22.843
on one, one at a time, one realtor would try it, and 
then she would tell somebody in her office. And

25:23.384 --> 25:26.108
then the next time that Wanda was at, one of the many 
breakfast meetings or lunch meetings for a

25:26.628 --> 25:47.962
realtor's association, we would give a door 
prize, a weekend at the San Luis or some other

25:26.628 --> 25:47.962
Woodlands affiliate, tell them they're welcome, 
tell them to get the key map, tell them to come to the

25:26.628 --> 25:47.962
information center, and then one or two people on 
the dais who had been through the experience said,

25:26.628 --> 25:47.962
I can tell you it really does work that way. And 
slowly, word of mouth, we got the momentum going,

25:48.403 --> 25:54.272
and it's working well. So the strategy remained 
the same. The tactics changed. We just said,

25:58.592 --> 26:00.053
what's your problem? How can we help? And that got 
going great. But again, I have to credit Wanda. She

26:06.499 --> 26:07.540
didn't stop there. In 87, another

26:07.840 --> 26:24.175
external factor, and there's a lot of factors that 
played into the last five years, the constriction

26:07.840 --> 26:24.175
of capital for the home builder community became a 
problem. And it became a big benefit for the

26:24.830 --> 26:28.916
Woodlands. Loan committees would not make loans 
for custom builders in lesser subdivisions. You

26:34.223 --> 26:35.605
had to be on the north side. You had to be in Kingwood 
or the Woodlands. And suddenly the realtors

26:38.048 --> 26:44.256
quickly realized that they have somebody from out 
of town. New homes in Houston tend to be cheaper

26:45.077 --> 26:48.362
than wherever they're coming from. So suddenly 
they can afford a brand new house. The realtors are

26:52.487 --> 26:54.550
going to take them to the brand new housing. On the 
north side, it happened to be Kingwood or the

26:55.373 --> 26:57.776
Woodlands. The buyer comes in. The buyer buys new. 
The loan committee says, see, it's safe to make

27:01.359 --> 27:05.484
construction loans in the Woodlands. And so they 
just would expand that line of credit to the max.

27:11.430 --> 27:14.994
And we continually added to the new home sales 
inventory. And the sales grew. And it became a

27:16.416 --> 27:18.278
self-fulfilling prophecy. Why only the 
Woodlands and Kingwood did? There are several.

27:26.170 --> 27:32.839
Well, one, loan committees everywhere were 
getting very paranoid about losing their jobs as

27:26.170 --> 27:32.839
one bank after another was in trouble in Houston. 
So they only wanted to make the safest possible

27:33.339 --> 27:35.702
loans. This was in 87 we're talking about? Yeah. 
And 87 was kind of the heyday. It's been throughout

27:41.710 --> 27:44.293
the last part of the 80s. And

27:44.313 --> 27:49.780
it was a spiral. It spiraled up for us and down for 
some of the other smaller custom home communities

27:49.840 --> 27:55.688
where you had less well-financed builders and in 
fact for us it became an opportunity in that as the

27:56.309 --> 28:23.329
FDIC and FSLIC would constrict how much money even 
a an

27:56.309 --> 28:23.329
operating bank could loan to a particular builder 
as those loan limits shrunk We then animated

28:23.647 --> 28:35.521
Mitchell Mortgage Company to institute a 
construction lending department, and we then

28:23.647 --> 28:35.521
would finance new home construction through our 
mortgage company. And part of the strategy there

28:36.482 --> 28:44.652
is, obviously it's a way to make money in 
construction financing, but what about the risk?

28:44.672 --> 28:45.794
Who is we in that? We own Mitchell Mortgage. Dale 
Andrius runs Mitchell Mortgage. Is we the

28:50.119 --> 28:51.240
Woodlands Corporation? We, the Woodlands Corp, 
own Mitchell Mortgage. Yes. Did George Mitchell

28:54.119 --> 28:56.381
anything to do with that? In terms of the decision 
to make construction loans or institute a

28:56.401 --> 29:00.905
mortgage company. Or the creation of the company. 
I don't know. It was here when I got here. Oh. I can't

29:04.308 --> 29:05.930
add to that. It's a logical extension when you have 
the amount of business we're doing to go ahead and

29:07.111 --> 29:14.017
form a mortgage company. Well, it fits some other 
things that Mr. Mitchell has done. And it also is a

29:17.300 --> 29:20.603
vehicle for us to... finance apartment projects 
or other non-residential financing

29:21.190 --> 29:34.525
opportunities, be it apartments or 
non-woodlands projects. I mean, they're just a

29:34.545 --> 29:35.766
bona fide. Or commercial stuff out here on the 
research forest drive. Yes, yes. Yeah, they can

29:38.950 --> 29:39.790
work on that. They're in that marketplace. So then 
what we had going was a healthy inventory the

29:50.198 --> 30:12.935
turnstiles were working well with realtors 
bringing in home buyers and then the realtors said

29:50.198 --> 30:12.935
the problem is my people don't have enough time to 
wait for your home builders to finish the

29:50.198 --> 30:12.935
construction of the new home. The employer here to 
for many times would give the employees several

30:14.954 --> 30:20.341
trips to make a home buying decision. Now they 
said, we can only afford one or two. So they had to

30:25.008 --> 30:26.610
make a quick decision. And frequently, they 
wanted they were dead set on getting brand new

30:28.372 --> 30:34.040
housing. But they had an interim housing problem 
where to live while their new home was completed.

30:41.531 --> 30:42.632
At the time, I think we had or at least a 15% vacancy 
rate in our apartment that we own, some 1,200 or

30:43.051 --> 30:52.223
1,300 apartments or 1,900 apartments that we own. 
So Wanda said, let's go rent some furniture and put

30:52.243 --> 31:00.714
in a Mr. Coffee and the television. And most of 
these people have a housing allowance. The

31:04.499 --> 31:06.221
employer will pay the rent. We can rent 
apartments. They only have to unpack one time. And

31:11.570 --> 31:20.362
if we're lucky, we'll get them an apartment in the 
same area where their child is going to go to

31:11.570 --> 31:20.362
elementary or middle school, and let's see if we 
can rent some of our own apartments. And it then

31:21.204 --> 31:35.063
snowballed into about 25 apartments that we 
leased from the apartment group, furnished them,

31:21.204 --> 31:35.063
helped these people move in and move out. and 
probably cycled somewhere around a third of our

31:35.566 --> 31:44.880
custom home buyers spent some time in the interim 
apartment or interim housing project program.

31:45.821 --> 31:52.130
And

31:45.821 --> 31:52.130
it was a lot of little things, all of which worked 
very well. Most of those programs are still in

31:53.573 --> 31:55.996
place today. The nature of the out-of-town buyer 
changed in late 88, or no, I should say late 89 to 90,

31:56.016 --> 32:04.729
and that is We no longer had a few major employers 
transferring tens to hundreds of people to

32:05.924 --> 32:12.710
Houston. Houston's cutbacks in the energy 
companies were very, very severe in 85, 86. And as

32:23.359 --> 32:25.921
it turns out, their business did not get worse. It 
either held or improved. And in the start of 1990,

32:30.084 --> 32:35.509
we took account found that we had almost 400 
employers

32:35.928 --> 32:44.738
talking about hiring two to six people during 
1990. And so suddenly we had the inverse of what had

32:44.918 --> 32:55.230
happened in 86, 87, 88, which was a very few 
companies moving many people to Houston. Now we

32:55.250 --> 32:57.393
had a much healthier economy. We had many 
companies hiring people, not shutting down an

32:57.433 --> 33:01.938
office elsewhere. But again, it translated into 
an out-of-town buyer. So the out-of-town buyer

33:06.472 --> 33:19.731
for the Woodlands and most of the other 
communities in Houston was the real saving grace

33:06.472 --> 33:19.731
for new home sales in the last part of the 80s. What 
would you say has been the mix? About two-thirds,

33:24.077 --> 33:25.278
one-third. There's been a real steady 
relationship. Two-thirds out-of-town,

33:28.082 --> 33:30.506
one-third. And you have new household formations 
locally. You have people that are uh if you go back

33:37.049 --> 34:00.677
to the late 70s early 80s when the first time buyer 
market was the strong market u.s homes general

33:37.049 --> 34:00.677
homes and others those people had had children 
they were then if you will upside down in their

33:37.049 --> 34:00.677
house that wasn't worth the debt and they those 
that stayed employed and stuck it out through the

34:00.961 --> 34:04.845
mid-'80s suddenly needed more room. And once 
their home could sell for debt or even lose money on

34:04.865 --> 34:13.134
the house, they had seen the flight to quality. 
They had seen values in the major communities not

34:13.154 --> 34:19.481
fall like they fell in the lesser communities. And 
so I think the educated Houstonian who witnessed

34:20.162 --> 34:28.791
the decline in value in the Houston area has 
learned that the bigger master plan communities

34:29.834 --> 34:36.765
didn't suffer as badly as the other communities 
did. And their tendency will be, I think, when they

34:37.266 --> 34:51.709
make a move, to continue moving to the bigger 
communities and have a little safer environment

34:37.266 --> 34:51.709
in which to make their home buying investment. And 
investment's not a term we even talk about. But

34:54.556 --> 35:01.164
it's, as you said a moment ago, you always buy the 
cheapest house on the block and hope to ride the

34:54.556 --> 35:01.164
coattails of inflation. That's part of every home 
buying decision. And there is some safety in

35:04.227 --> 35:08.352
buying in the bigger communities. And the 
Houstonians have learned it, the realtors know

35:08.372 --> 35:15.800
it, and in a way it's a self-fulfilling prophecy. 
Everybody believes it, so it happens that way.

35:20.326 --> 35:21.627
Within a given price range, I would think, and I may 
be wrong about this, but I would think that the

35:23.378 --> 35:29.584
woodlands homes might be slightly more 
expensive. I mean, comparing feature for feature

35:30.926 --> 35:38.333
and what have you because of the restrictions and 
the attention paid to quality. Has that at any time

35:39.314 --> 35:41.756
been perceived? Obviously, with some it's going 
to, but with others, it manifestly has not been a

35:41.876 --> 35:51.546
deterrent to sales. It's definitely a factor, and 
it probably always has been in the woodlands a

35:52.015 --> 36:15.630
factor in that

35:52.015 --> 36:15.630
we do surveys every six months for all of the 
greater Houston area as to lot prices and the price

35:52.015 --> 36:15.630
of the home built on the lot and what the home buyer 
pays. And we will be at the top. or very shortly be at

36:21.513 --> 36:23.376
the top. And we, as a strategy to serve the 
stockholders, will try and make as much money as

36:24.718 --> 36:31.409
possible. And you do that by getting more for the 
lot than, or you get as much for the lot as the market

36:31.610 --> 36:37.439
will stand. But I think that when faced with the 
question as comes up, why is this home more

36:41.560 --> 36:50.113
expensive here than in some other community? And 
certainly when you have the production builders,

36:50.133 --> 37:09.762
Rylan Pulte Village Weekly, who build in multiple 
locations, who the salesman will tell you, our

36:50.133 --> 37:09.762
same Brookside model in another subdivision is 
less than here in the Woodlands.

37:11.918 --> 37:24.071
They simply then have to get them in the car, show 
them the bike trails, show them the parks, show

37:11.918 --> 37:24.071
them the amenities, and talk about the lifestyle, 
and then ask them to choose. And if they will, I

37:25.233 --> 37:41.250
think in every market study we've ever done, the 
majority of the cause of a visit was a

37:25.233 --> 37:41.250
recommendation from a friend or relative who 
lives in the woodlands. And so it's been

37:41.332 --> 38:03.340
interesting to me to see in the five and a half years 
that I've been here that no matter how hard we try to

37:41.332 --> 38:03.340
describe this place in print or radio or 
videotape, the selling takes place when one

37:41.332 --> 38:03.340
resident talks to a nonresident and there's 
something in their tone There's some, I'm

38:03.708 --> 38:14.823
thinking now of a fellow that moved in across the 
street from my home who said, I was on a plane

38:03.708 --> 38:14.823
talking with a high school kid that went to 
McCullough High School. And I asked him, where did

38:14.843 --> 38:16.025
he live? And he started telling me all about the 
woodlands. And it was the tone and what this young

38:18.468 --> 38:25.598
man said that led the guy to bring his wife and kids 
to come and take a look at the woodlands. And I would

38:26.084 --> 38:30.391
venture to say that he could have read our ads, and 
maybe he would have come. But the tone and the

38:31.052 --> 38:36.140
conversation is what made him make a mental note to 
be sure to come. And that's where you

38:36.921 --> 38:48.079
convince the would-be home buyer to come and take a 
look and talk to people. And the more they talk, the

38:48.139 --> 38:51.765
more they're going to learn. And then they're 
going to find out that there's more to it the list

38:54.738 --> 39:00.668
price on our inventory roster versus some other 
location's inventory roster. And once they see

39:01.208 --> 39:20.880
the film and get a feel for the scope of the 
Woodlands, because it is unlike any other

39:01.208 --> 39:20.880
development, it's not a subdivision, it's not 
like anything that they're familiar with, nor

39:01.208 --> 39:20.880
could they necessarily imagine that there would 
be a place like it. This one has a different

39:21.282 --> 39:24.305
philosophy. Yeah, it's a unique philosophy, a 
unique development. And it takes some time to

39:27.788 --> 39:35.314
understand, to say the least. In these same 
marketing studies, have you identified? I

39:37.736 --> 39:48.566
mean, that's the positive side. You know why they 
came. What happens to people who don't? is there is

39:51.792 --> 40:16.686
there a flip side to that the people that come and 
say no thank you yeah um we've done a lot of market

39:51.792 --> 40:16.686
research certainly over the years kingwood has 
been the number one competitor and we'll do a lot of

39:51.792 --> 40:16.686
survey work with both

39:51.792 --> 40:16.686
there are many people who prefer to have

40:17.712 --> 40:25.263
a very crisp, clean, manicured, landscaped look 
to their community. And the natural look is not one

40:25.283 --> 40:29.449
that they're comfortable with, and they say, no, 
thank you. And it's like, tastes great, less

40:31.431 --> 40:33.595
spilling. There's arguments on both sides. The 
ones here either liked it in the beginning,

40:36.298 --> 40:45.291
learned to like it, and many times converts are the 
more ardent believers. Sure, you bet. Once they

40:47.362 --> 41:16.575
see from the other things that we do, like the Arbor 
Day or the Wildflower Festivals, where we give

40:47.362 --> 41:16.575
away seeds or we give away saplings and plant 
forty-some thousand trees every Arbor Day, and

40:47.362 --> 41:16.575
then they see that the forest regrows itself and 
they plug into that,

40:47.362 --> 41:16.575
what you end up with is, we did a survey last year in 
the shopping mall near Kingwood. And Kingwood

41:19.640 --> 41:23.265
themselves then did a follow-up survey. And in 
talking with the research firm that did the work,

41:24.086 --> 41:37.745
the young lady that I spoke with said that they were 
startled in their interviews to talk with

41:24.086 --> 41:37.745
existing Kingwood residents. And the question 
was, if you were transferred out of the Houston

41:37.945 --> 41:46.697
area, and then in three or four years you came back, 
where would you consider buying when you were

41:46.930 --> 41:49.493
transferred back to Houston in, say, 1994. The 
Woodlands had a loyalty factor that was virtually

41:51.936 --> 41:55.580
100%. And they said in all of the times that they've 
ever done surveys, be it for Kingwood or any other

41:55.720 --> 42:09.356
community, every other community had a much lower 
loyalty factor than the Woodlands residents. And

42:09.376 --> 42:16.144
so it goes back to my statement about being 
converted into believing and understanding what

42:09.376 --> 42:16.144
the Woodlands is all about. That doesn't surprise 
me at all. The question I guess I'm trying to get at

42:17.621 --> 42:40.804
is, is the Woodlands not in fact pre-selecting,

42:17.621 --> 42:40.804
in a large number of cases at least, people who have 
an affinity for, you mentioned the lady from

42:17.621 --> 42:40.804
Minnesota, people who have an affinity for trees, 
people who have an affinity for athletic, you

42:17.621 --> 42:40.804
know, the amenities which the Woodlands 
provides. Someone in Kingwood, for example,

42:43.394 --> 42:47.720
Kingwood isn't that different than dozens of 
other communities around. And so there is not...

42:47.900 --> 42:54.830
You don't buy into any unique set of philosophies 
and what have you. You could substitute that for

42:54.850 --> 42:57.434
any number of others. The Woodlands isn't. If you 
take a look... Let me try and answer your question

43:00.538 --> 43:03.202
this way. If you take a look at the brochures or the 
magazines or the newspaper ads, and you look at...

43:12.790 --> 43:29.731
Even in West Houston, in areas where the only trees 
are the ones that they've planted beside their

43:12.790 --> 43:29.731
hiking bike trail, you will find that most of them 
photographically appear to be heavily wooded,

43:12.790 --> 43:29.731
well amenityed with tennis courts and swimming 
pools. And you read the list of what do you have in

43:30.512 --> 43:36.079
your community, and they're going to read very 
similar. And if you take a look at what Mother

43:37.822 --> 43:41.346
Nature gave Kingwood the woodlands there's a lot 
of similarities East Texas piney forest and they

43:42.119 --> 44:07.452
have chosen to develop theirs in a manicured 
fashion we've done a different fashion I think the

43:42.119 --> 44:07.452
consumer once

43:42.119 --> 44:07.452
they visit each of the communities is not going to 
understand the difference until they talk to the

44:08.242 --> 44:29.705
residents or the salespeople or spend a little bit 
of time in the community and that's

44:08.242 --> 44:29.705
where this tone in the conversation becomes so 
important and I think that's one of the keys to why

44:08.242 --> 44:29.705
they do decide to come or not to come. What is it 
though? Is it the woods? Is it a combination of all

44:34.350 --> 44:36.713
of the above? Have you identified the, well, case 
in point, my secretary, we'll be transcribing

44:37.267 --> 44:42.916
this, Terry. My secretary is from Massachusetts 
and is enamored with West Texas, something which I

44:44.959 --> 44:52.230
have never quite understood. But nevertheless, 
it exists, and I think she's sincere about that. A

44:56.556 --> 45:03.547
place like the Woodlands probably would not 
fascinate her in the least. You see what I'm

45:03.567 --> 45:04.168
saying? And that's why I ask, are you 
pre-selecting for a certain type of personality

45:04.891 --> 45:10.898
trait? Is there, in fact, a personality profile of 
people who live in the woodlands or become

45:10.918 --> 45:15.844
converted to the woodlands? Is there, in fact, a 
one overwhelming thing? Is it a package of half a

45:19.749 --> 45:21.851
dozen? Do you understand what I'm saying?

45:27.118 --> 45:29.300
I'll try and answer that in several fashions. You 
can get some statistics and numbers from Mail

45:30.021 --> 45:34.847
DuPay. part of this buyer profile of Kingwood 
residents versus the Woodlands. We will have more

45:40.483 --> 45:43.186
self-employeds. We will tend to have more 
independent thinkers.

45:51.576 --> 46:01.527
They will tend to have more of the

45:51.576 --> 46:01.527
conspicuous consumers, the more joiners. they 
mean king kingwood more uh conspicuous

46:01.810 --> 46:28.240
consumption the kind of people who when they say i 
live at falcon point they know that the listener

46:01.810 --> 46:28.240
understands they can afford falcon point and they 
want to make that statement and the woodlands you

46:01.810 --> 46:28.240
know my my corny comparison is that You know, the 
kids get on the school bus here and they're all

46:28.658 --> 46:32.041
wearing guest jeans. Some of them are 
hand-me-downs and some of them are from

46:32.662 --> 46:39.469
low-income housing where they bought them at a 
resale shop. The kids know who's who and the kids

46:40.129 --> 46:46.676
know who's got the money, but at least they're all 
on the same school bus together. You know, we're

46:47.556 --> 46:57.366
not going to turn around mankind in one community 
or one development, but in a way that's a little bit

46:47.556 --> 46:57.366
more real world to come to grips with the fact that 
the world is comprised of many people other than

46:57.717 --> 47:03.245
just your peers or your parents' peers. And that's 
nothing that you're going to understand on a first

47:04.106 --> 47:08.172
visit.

47:13.880 --> 47:27.319
The challenge for us, and especially if you talk to 
some of the people that have been here longer than

47:13.880 --> 47:27.319
myself, is to maintain this small town kind of 
feel. For example,
