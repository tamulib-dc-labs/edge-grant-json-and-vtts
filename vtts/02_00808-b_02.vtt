00:01.870 --> 00:03.832
Interview with Mr. D.A. Anderson, side four.

00:09.058 --> 00:25.416
When we were talking about the place of changing 
the voting to at-large, and maybe we've mentioned

00:09.058 --> 00:25.416
this before, but you said that things were not 
being, things on the council weren't able to be

00:09.058 --> 00:25.416
done. There was always the opposition from... And 
then, knowing that they went in, you know what I

00:31.958 --> 00:41.190
mean, with a very limited number of votes, this 
wasn't right. And the people were worked up, as I

00:41.210 --> 00:45.095
indicated earlier. They came to the council, and I 
gave them an opportunity to see them turn down

00:45.115 --> 00:55.068
things that I wanted passed, that the people 
wanted passed. And they just refused right before

00:55.088 --> 00:59.113
the eyes of the public. And that made them mad 
enough that they wanted to send around a petition

00:59.667 --> 01:09.672
to get them off the council. So I told them we'll 
just wait. It wasn't too long before I could get the

01:12.259 --> 01:15.567
time period. before they went off to council. And 
then they came wanting to know who I wanted to put on

01:17.630 --> 01:21.334
the council. And so we got everything squared up 
for the next election. And when the next election

01:26.540 --> 01:30.926
came, why, we had these other council members. And 
then we approached the subject of more equity in

01:30.946 --> 01:36.112
voting. And so then the voting lines were changed. 
Well, they've been changed several times since.

01:44.266 --> 01:50.796
When the ruling came, for example, and the 
students could vote, that imposed another

01:44.266 --> 01:50.796
problem. So, that was something else. And

01:55.343 --> 02:00.011
they were changed then. So, in essence, that's it. 
Have you already mentioned when we said that they

02:02.915 --> 02:10.443
kept things from being done, what kind of things 
were they stopping? Well, I couldn't get anything

02:10.463 --> 02:13.646
passed. Oh, okay. I mean, it was a matter of 
anything that I wanted, you know. We weren't

02:20.554 --> 02:26.160
making any progress at all in the city.

02:26.180 --> 02:27.982
We just wanted to go, but we couldn't go. I mean, 
it's time. and we were no longer a little community

02:29.932 --> 02:52.513
and we had to think big and move big and move out and 
as you know when you're reading why from then on why

02:29.932 --> 02:52.513
you didn't make very strident moves towards doing 
a lot of things we mentioned the library Well, you

02:52.780 --> 03:02.232
can go into any of the areas in the area that we were 
trying to turn it with. In the old days, you know, my

03:02.292 --> 03:08.059
city manager got picked up a car every year. And 
then the next year, or the year that he picked up his

03:10.122 --> 03:19.434
new car, well, the police chief got the other car 
that he had. I mean, that's the way everything was

03:20.094 --> 03:22.197
passed on. from one to the other. And they got 
through, or went through the sewer to, well, sewer

03:25.179 --> 03:34.272
disposal plant, or some other plant. And 
incidentally, there is a report someplace in

03:34.873 --> 03:48.792
there, too, where, of course, I had a good friend in 
Garrison, he was head of the Department of Public

03:34.873 --> 03:48.792
Safety in Washington. And this is the only city in 
the state of Texas where he did this, and he did this

03:50.088 --> 03:56.259
as a favor to me. Now, he originally from Luffman, 
and I used to live in Luffman, and I knew him very

03:56.720 --> 04:02.890
well. And I wanted to know if he would come in and 
evaluate our police department, let me know what

04:04.193 --> 04:15.252
we needed, what was good, what was desirable, and 
so on. So he sent in two or three men, sometimes

04:15.923 --> 04:35.810
every

04:15.923 --> 04:35.810
three men, to evaluate and make a report to me and 
the city council on our police department. And

04:35.830 --> 04:36.511
they went with the department. They covered 
everything from the type of uniforms to their guns

04:36.531 --> 04:45.863
to their weakness in training, every aspect of law 
enforcement. and this was very very good because

04:46.653 --> 05:11.631
it pointed out not only to me but to other council 
members where all the weaknesses were in our

04:46.653 --> 05:11.631
police department in terms of its future 
expansion i mean we have something to go about

04:46.653 --> 05:11.631
which we haven't had and this is the only city in the 
state of mexico Did you run into it? No, I didn't.

05:14.160 --> 05:19.025
But it did ring to mind when I did run into it, and 
that was a fire department. Was it also during this

05:19.045 --> 05:28.513
period that you and the council decided to try to 
establish a college station fire department? Oh,

05:29.514 --> 05:29.694
yeah. Totally did. Right. And remove yourself 
from A&M? Yeah. Yeah. But this enabled us to move

05:35.880 --> 05:41.365
out because, you know, they wore different 
uniforms. Should we buy things? Should we buy the

05:44.533 --> 05:45.614
yachts? Should we buy the uniforms? You know, what 
would strengthen the department and all this

05:47.076 --> 05:55.986
stuff.

05:56.046 --> 05:58.809
We've got an excellent report. I have pride in 
myself. You know, this is one other area that I

05:59.310 --> 06:09.141
wanted

05:59.310 --> 06:09.141
to improve and I'm glad that DPS did it. I'm sorry 
again that I didn't make a copy of that. There are

06:12.592 --> 06:16.256
certain things that I don't understand. The same 
thing with that Negro report that they went from

06:16.276 --> 06:20.601
house to house. That was a pretty

06:21.062 --> 06:29.653
expensive report. They told me, they said, now 
we've made a lot of surveys for the city, but we're

06:29.673 --> 06:37.322
not saying it was accurate. This is

06:37.893 --> 06:52.356
accurate. And of course there are places on which I 
helped them on too. But that report is something we

06:55.380 --> 06:57.123
need to prioritize more. And that other report 
will be the only one of its kind. The DPS turned it

06:58.265 --> 06:59.006
down. No other city got that service.

07:04.555 --> 07:05.436
That's one of them. Did a lot of College Station's 
growth and your

07:06.935 --> 07:21.753
concern about the growth of the city spring from 
the fact that A&M was also growing at that time?

07:21.773 --> 07:23.135
Yeah, sure. You know, you could see, you could 
sense the growth coming more and more. The day

07:25.778 --> 07:34.349
would come, not too far distant, that you would 
need the blockchain right. And there's still You

07:36.415 --> 07:55.717
know

07:36.415 --> 07:55.717
what I mean.

07:55.738 --> 07:56.398
There are still those that grind. I don't

07:56.418 --> 08:01.624
know whether you're aware of what's going on at the 
Humana Hospital. No, I'm not. Humana wants to get

08:01.905 --> 08:02.826
out of there and come out. They didn't get any 
support from certain crime people when they were

08:02.846 --> 08:04.568
trying to expand. I don't know whether it was 
political or not, but... They're just,

08:06.301 --> 08:16.515
they don't want the crawler station to get you in 
any circumstance. And there's a committee formed

08:16.976 --> 08:22.203
that way. Leave no stone unturned to be sure that 
the crawler station doesn't give you any lessons.

08:26.910 --> 08:27.230
It's resentment. That's some of the following. 
They dread, they just would rather, I mean, it's

08:27.971 --> 08:29.794
funny because... People's

08:30.365 --> 08:37.353
good are set aside for, I guess, for a type of 
vanity. Yeah. I'm not sure the word. Yeah, yeah.

08:40.697 --> 08:49.808
Well, it's a, you know, you have to understand a lot 
of that background sometimes and appreciate

08:40.697 --> 08:49.808
some, you know, certain things. And having gone 
through a lot of it myself, you know, going over

08:49.828 --> 08:53.993
there. I'd like to talk

08:56.167 --> 09:11.950
about the lawsuit that was brought against the 
city during your term. And I was wondering how the

09:11.970 --> 09:23.326
lawsuit evolved and what Boyan's purpose in 
bringing a suit against the city. Well, he said

09:26.525 --> 09:35.939
that

09:26.525 --> 09:35.939
we were holding two offices in trust.

09:35.959 --> 09:47.195
We held a position with the university and either 
councilman or mayor with the city of Colorado

09:35.959 --> 09:47.195
State. Now, what prompted that? Now, that had 
previously come up. You may have seen the attorney

09:52.003 --> 09:55.688
general opinion of 1938

09:57.035 --> 10:25.287
you read that and they said it was all right and they 
have said it was all right right along up until that

09:57.035 --> 10:25.287
period

09:57.035 --> 10:25.287
uh this was an effort by him to uh i know he was after 
me but he got the whole council now What brought

10:25.435 --> 10:33.343
this on was the matter of zoning that he didn't like 
over in this particular area. That was his domain.

10:35.125 --> 10:39.270
He was being elected on 21 votes. You know, he was 
throwing his weight around. He had money. It was

10:44.515 --> 10:55.307
very interesting during the end of the year to see 
how, well I better not say that.

10:55.777 --> 11:00.523
Well, no, that's all right. He disliked the 
treatment he was receiving because he couldn't

11:02.345 --> 11:10.315
have it his own way. He had some trouble with the 
university earlier. He had trouble with the

11:15.922 --> 11:16.904
student body and whatnot. But be that as it may, he 
resented very much So, he brought this suit. He was

11:27.787 --> 11:31.872
no longer counsel. He went around and picked up 
some things and got Joe married. And how Joe got on?

11:39.963 --> 11:41.505
He dropped out? Yeah, it took him quite a bit of 
money to drop out. Right, about $200,000. Oh, it

11:46.512 --> 11:49.015
took him more than that. We were laughing about it 
the other day. He picked up my, every time I went, he

11:51.920 --> 11:55.524
picked up my check. He still apologizes to me for 
that. But at any rate, they brought this suit and

12:01.450 --> 12:09.478
brought us into court here. And Judge Davis has 
worked more than I did. Well, Bill is a friend of the

12:13.962 --> 12:19.868
university, a friend of the city council, a friend 
of the county. Bill was, you know, just, do you know

12:20.422 --> 12:24.249
Bill Bishop? I don't know him. Oh. Does he still 
lie? Oh, he was very, you know, very well-liked,

12:27.415 --> 12:40.540
and we liked him for sitting on the judge 
continually, and he didn't think we'd have a lady

12:27.415 --> 12:40.540
to stand on and voted in our favor. And Boyette made 
the statement that he's going to carry this work to

12:41.633 --> 12:52.124
the U.S. And he has the money. And look at the money 
he's still making at that time. He has no choice.

13:05.118 --> 13:05.839
Does he own the land? All of those stores are leased 
by him. But

13:10.338 --> 13:35.518
be that as it may, he was

13:10.338 --> 13:35.518
determined that

13:10.338 --> 13:35.518
he was going to bring home the U.S. Supreme Court 
instead. So he took us over to the district court in

13:36.258 --> 13:40.542
Boston. And the judge over there .

13:48.450 --> 13:50.092
Oh, really? Over in Boston.

13:57.259 --> 13:59.161
Over in Joe? Yeah, in Joe. Was it Brendan for you? I 
didn't realize that. That's another story. But he

14:00.843 --> 14:04.206
then ruled this area. We had to go over there twice.

14:11.924 --> 14:15.508
Oh, he never did rule. Boyad carried it down to the 
District U.S. Court in Houston.

14:27.802 --> 14:30.906
And the federal judge ruled. It was a surprise to us 
when it came. that the ruling of the Attorney

14:34.966 --> 14:42.677
General wasn't there and that we were out. I mean, 
we had to be out. And there was nothing else he could

14:48.545 --> 14:50.448
do beyond that. I mean, he had gone. He had the money 
to do it. We were criticized for letting the city

14:55.995 --> 14:59.320
pay The attorney,

15:00.380 --> 15:21.631
we hired an attorney in Houston, and the city paid 
for it. I forgot what the amount was. But O.E. and

15:22.432 --> 15:23.133
his were the two sides of that. That was the only 
protection we had. Otherwise, but we... They won.

15:25.032 --> 15:33.940
Well, then it was following this that I took the 
action that I did independently and passed it down

15:25.032 --> 15:33.940
to them. All right, buddy, if you think

15:33.960 --> 15:42.849
you got me, go ahead. And then I did. I did. I'm not 
kidding you with that. I worked a day and night,

15:46.893 --> 15:50.957
blood, sweat, and tears, too. I was determined

15:51.410 --> 15:59.319
that I would protect the Constitution. So, I mean, 
you took the lead in the state and moved. Oh, yeah. I

16:04.024 --> 16:05.486
was the only one that did it. I had to. Even though it 
affected others? Oh, yeah. It's like it affected

16:06.587 --> 16:09.391
school districts? Oh, yeah.

16:12.754 --> 16:16.018
Yeah, there was a principle involved. You know, I 
just... I just couldn't have,

16:18.781 --> 16:28.609
you know, I couldn't lay down. I just had to go. So, 
we won. Eddie wanted me to go back as mayor, and I

16:33.874 --> 16:41.961
said, no, I've got to go back now. Oh, really? I was 
wondering why he never returned. Oh, I don't know.

16:43.362 --> 16:43.963
It was a bad thing. He wanted me to run for county 
judge. I didn't want that. I didn't care. It was a

16:45.444 --> 16:46.024
problem for me. I don't know. Some of them wanted me 
to run for mayor at that time. I

16:48.380 --> 16:54.248
wouldn't want it. No, there's a lot

16:54.268 --> 17:01.679
going on. Well, you know, I've had my share of that. 
Why go in? I haven't been to, you know, a lot of

17:03.642 --> 17:07.888
people. For some of them, for some of the 
old-timers, they still expect me to run around

17:07.908 --> 17:14.678
with a tie and a coat. You know, old people, for some 
reason. Well, during the trial, Boyant couldn't

17:18.653 --> 17:29.888
explain, I mean, his ulterior reason was that the 
city wasn't allowing him to do what he wanted him to

17:18.653 --> 17:29.888
do. No, no, no. He didn't bring that up. Right, 
right. What he was trying to say is that we were

17:33.833 --> 17:40.021
holding two offices in trust. His ulterior motive 
was never brought up. Well, I mean, how did he show

17:42.564 --> 17:46.770
that it affected the city... in a harmful

17:47.206 --> 18:03.163
way?

18:03.183 --> 18:09.190
Well, there was no business

18:03.183 --> 18:09.190
people who were representative of it. We needed 
people who were on the city council to represent

18:09.210 --> 18:10.851
the business interests. Actually, we didn't have 
too many people of business. This was really a

18:11.953 --> 18:15.236
university community. Right. Primarily. He was 
saying that the council was doing things

18:15.616 --> 18:17.078
specifically for Indians. Well, he, in part of the 
court proceedings, he accused us of that. For

18:25.207 --> 18:31.595
example,

18:25.207 --> 18:31.595
the lighting on the other side of the campus. Oh, he 
brought up the underpass.

18:36.701 --> 18:39.264
He always brought that up. I

18:39.284 --> 18:47.554
never understood him because he was worth 
millions of dollars. He never helped. He never

18:51.978 --> 18:59.572
contributed

18:51.978 --> 18:59.572
to a student body. You know what I mean. He never 
contributed anything. Kind of like he resented

19:06.986 --> 19:08.108
the university for some reason.

19:17.032 --> 19:40.174
I

19:17.032 --> 19:40.174
don't know. He had all the money he needed. He had 
his summer home up in the lake. I've been up on his

19:44.678 --> 19:45.839
plane for years. We got along great. Invited up 
there. There

19:47.356 --> 20:11.788
were other

19:47.356 --> 20:11.788
people that signed the suit, and there was a 
question of whether or not the people really knew

19:47.356 --> 20:11.788
what they were signing. Did they realize that they 
were going to bring a suit against the city? Joe

20:13.450 --> 20:13.971
did, he said. Do you know how, the way it 
represented it in San Diego? Oh, no. Well, I heard

20:19.196 --> 20:26.550
Joe say, you know, we need to petition. We need to 
get more business people on the city council. Now,

20:31.838 --> 20:40.047
the business people were the few motels that were 
here, Western and Joe at that time. And let's see,

20:40.067 --> 20:42.609
was there another one? Oh, yeah, there was one 
across the street. Well, there were a few motels,

20:46.994 --> 20:52.700
service stations, there was a bank. You know what I 
mean. They were representing the business

20:54.802 --> 20:55.944
community. And other than Boyette, the others 
didn't seem to be playing. But, oh, now there were

21:02.281 --> 21:15.573
some, there was a grocery store in Southside,

21:02.281 --> 21:15.573
the dentist, and a few things like this. But 
really, they weren't concerned as much as Boyev

21:15.593 --> 21:21.438
was. He, I think this was mainly an excuse in terms 
of, you know, his feeling towards those who looked

21:21.458 --> 21:31.107
at him this way. There were others on the council, 
of course, objecting to it. Well, after I got in and

21:36.256 --> 21:46.159
got the other, you know, had my way there, why, uh, 
Marcy couldn't, couldn't do anything for me. I

21:46.180 --> 21:47.222
didn't make sure that, uh, We thought it was

21:49.345 --> 22:08.888
proper and just. Well, was he upset that he had lost 
the election? Oh yeah, he had it. Yeah, he didn't

22:10.310 --> 22:10.970
even speak to me. And he eventually died. I felt 
sorry

22:11.471 --> 22:18.639
for

22:11.471 --> 22:18.639
him, too. He was somewhat of a loner. I think

22:19.720 --> 22:42.073
he was turned on by another organization. He was 
turned on, and I think he was at that meeting. I

22:43.175 --> 22:43.816
think he was not an extrovert. I'm not sure. He was 
very spontaneous.

22:53.960 --> 22:59.226
That's part of it. Some of the council members 
resigned, and you still stayed on. Do you remember

23:03.650 --> 23:07.775
encouraging people to run? When was this? Well, 
during the suit.

23:13.481 --> 23:19.146
The ruling came through that you could not hold 
office and receive your warrant. Yeah, some of

23:19.747 --> 23:20.608
them. So they were forced to resign. Yeah, I went 
off for three

23:26.090 --> 23:33.361
months. I don't know when the others went off. 
Well, you were the last to leave before Jim Dozier.

23:39.270 --> 23:40.612
Jim Dozier stayed on. Yeah, he was the one that 
remained until I think the... I think the Texas

23:44.213 --> 23:52.702
Supreme Court wouldn't hear it, and it would take 
several years before the Supreme Court could hear

23:44.213 --> 23:52.702
it. I know it was all appeal. But in the meantime, 
she didn't check with me. No, no. That's what the

24:01.872 --> 24:05.756
wife told me. You can't eat unprincipled. You 
can't eat unprincipled, right. But... Do you

24:13.897 --> 24:20.904
remember encouraging Mr. Vaughn or Mr. Luther to 
come? Oh, yeah, I encouraged him. I was really

24:23.566 --> 24:26.269
behind. What we did, maybe this wasn't proper, but 
I thought it was. I had sort of a committee to get

24:33.295 --> 24:41.423
together, made up of people from different areas 
of the city. And we sat around the city hall and I

24:42.787 --> 24:58.229
said, you know, we need to put in office some people 
who y'all think would serve and would do a good job

24:42.787 --> 24:58.229
for the city. And I said, I don't know who they are, 
you know what I mean, but I would prefer that we

24:58.249 --> 25:11.528
discuss it and come to some agreement as to who 
would best serve our community. And if we are so

25:11.727 --> 25:18.594
inclined, why, maybe all of us can agree to support 
them. I said, I don't know who they may be, but, you

25:18.614 --> 25:25.782
know, whoever, we all might pick one name. So we 
did. We didn't have any pressure on us, for sure.

25:33.510 --> 25:36.773
So, names like Dan Davis came. He went over and 
that's all

25:37.748 --> 25:47.281
right. He represented people, represented very 
well the people over there. And, you know, they

25:51.527 --> 25:54.551
were still working with the other person. 
Representing the old recycling of the city. Well,

25:55.513 --> 25:56.114
that was good, you know. They had a picture of, you 
know, that would be good. So I said, well, I want you

25:58.184 --> 26:05.215
all to support him. And everybody in the 
department said, yeah, but you think Dan would

26:05.235 --> 26:08.600
make a good company. So I went to see Dan, see if he'd 
serve, and he went and prod him a little bit, and his

26:08.620 --> 26:18.775
wife. I finally got him to serve. And the same thing 
came up about Lindsey. Lindsey's up here, he's a

26:25.942 --> 26:28.265
college hero. He's well known in the university. 
You know him. They go through all the rigmarole and

26:34.914 --> 26:39.961
run off to just pray. Yeah, you got Lindsey to run 
and do what's up. I'd go and see Lindsey at the end of

26:42.585 --> 26:45.509
the month. He agreed to serve. And we did that to get 
things started. And it worked out very well. I

26:52.157 --> 27:03.527
didn't mean that they wouldn't agree or disagree 
with me at the table, because we've had some strong

26:52.157 --> 27:03.527
disagreements. But at any rate, they were honest 
disagreements.

27:10.794 --> 27:14.918
So we did this for a while, and I thought it was very 
successful. Because we could get people,

27:15.539 --> 27:20.914
otherwise we wouldn't, you know, we couldn't get 
people. Because if I came to you and asked you to

27:20.934 --> 27:30.460
run, you'd say, well, I don't know anybody, I don't 
have any support, but if I told you, well...

27:30.625 --> 27:34.911
There's 12 people, you know, from all areas of the 
city. You know, they vote for you and possibly, you

27:34.931 --> 27:51.672
know, give $5 or $10, which, you know, any campaign 
expenses you can add, you'd be more inclined to,

27:34.931 --> 27:51.672
you know, accept it or at least think about it 
seriously. And in this way, we've got a pretty big

27:52.850 --> 27:58.218
cross section. We've got an engineer, we have a 
sociologist, Cliff Lansdell was an engineer, Joe

27:58.238 --> 28:11.800
McGrath worked with a planter, but he was back in 
something. But I mean, we had a good mix across the

28:11.820 --> 28:17.549
country. And we got along good together. Oh, we had 
some, you know, some words between us once in a

28:22.297 --> 28:33.957
while, and that was to be expected.

28:33.977 --> 28:41.470
So, this served for a while, and then that idea was 
dropped in favor of others who wanted to run and

28:33.977 --> 28:41.470
enter the game together. Well, are you saying that 
this committee used law very newly? Oh, no, no, no.

28:48.595 --> 28:56.330
No, just after the... Just after the thing to get, 
you know... To get people on the council. Right.

28:56.971 --> 28:57.753
Right. Right, okay. This is after you were mayor, 
but the city went back to the ward system, and it was

29:01.160 --> 29:12.295
kind of a court-ish type of a matter. And do

29:12.315 --> 29:24.872
you remember getting

29:12.315 --> 29:24.872
under the condition to either recount the vote, or 
just... called

29:25.392 --> 29:49.586
him into the ballot, because apparently he read 
very badly in the ballot. And so it was about 1976,

29:49.606 --> 29:51.849
and he was sitting, put on the ballot, picked a boy, 
and went back to the vote system. And... Oh, well,

29:51.869 --> 29:53.431
you know, that was just... That was just a hazy 
recollection. You remember that? But I don't

29:53.832 --> 29:54.673
think I'll ever do that again.

30:01.488 --> 30:18.693
Oh, well, anyway, basically, the city went back

30:01.488 --> 30:18.693
to the ward system for just two years, and then as 
soon as the waiting period was up, they pushed

30:01.488 --> 30:18.693
back. Yeah. I forget. I remember it, but I don't 
recall. I wish I'd gotten over what I had on the

30:22.879 --> 30:29.569
study out here in the back. Yeah. It would refresh

30:30.293 --> 30:40.121
me. I looked at some of

30:40.141 --> 30:54.554
that material for about three weeks. It was 
interesting to run across things that I had almost

30:54.574 --> 30:56.055
forgotten about. Well, one thing that you have 
referred to is the historic rivalry between . This

31:00.685 --> 31:22.933
is,

31:00.685 --> 31:22.933
it has been going

31:00.685 --> 31:22.933
on for such a long time. Right. Are you going to make 
it before? Yeah, they, I think it started a long

31:23.875 --> 31:25.517
time ago. You know, the student body, they had a 
problem with the student body in crime. Then we

31:27.119 --> 31:28.060
incorporated in 38, anything like that. And then 
they came out and stole part of our schooling. For

31:33.825 --> 31:38.271
example, Roseberry was part of college study. A 
lot of people, we thought it was in our area. And

31:43.758 --> 31:47.263
they came out one night and took that. They used to 
be six miles before we took in crime. And they came

31:54.743 --> 32:01.212
down and expanded their boundary one night 
through to Rosemarie and all that area right up to

31:54.743 --> 32:01.212
our tunnel. Was this at the time of incorporation? 
No, no. This was the second time. Yeah, right

32:13.548 --> 32:14.529
after. Yeah, they... They came up and took in 
Rosemary. Well, the people that lived there were

32:20.512 --> 32:25.157
university people. That moved out on that 
particular area. It wasn't in Brine at the time.

32:29.022 --> 32:33.467
And it was in our little consolidated school 
district. And when Brine took it in, when I went to

32:33.487 --> 32:40.956
Brine, we went to the Brine Independent School 
District. And it hurt our little school down here.

32:44.520 --> 32:46.883
So that created it. You know, it was following 
that, that day we heard they were going to take me

32:47.183 --> 32:52.629
into an airport. And you know, just when they were 
going all the way around us. So we got together, and

32:55.472 --> 33:05.384
that particular night, we passed on first reading 
that all the university land is considered part of

32:55.472 --> 33:05.384
City College Station. And that's why, you know, 
when you look at the map, it's so expensive. Be that

33:09.929 --> 33:16.937
as it may, that was part of this early, you know, 
misunderstanding between us. Now I did, I did

33:18.166 --> 33:28.380
institute, went there, now again, papers, 
newspapers weren't at the meeting. The system

33:28.400 --> 33:47.286
whereby, well now this was in the era of Jack Zuby, 
and what's her

33:28.400 --> 33:47.286
name?

33:47.307 --> 33:47.667
What was her name? I went through several layers of 
crime. No, no, she wasn't a mayor, but she was a very

33:50.960 --> 34:01.691
dominant figure in the crime commission. And I 
instituted meetings with the crime commission at

34:01.711 --> 34:15.004
the Monaghan, whereby we need to be honest with 
each other and not pull these tricks. The first

34:17.826 --> 34:24.254
meeting, when I spoke to Michael, I didn't come out 
and it was very plain as to the purpose of the

34:17.826 --> 34:24.254
meeting. As far as I was concerned, I enjoyed the 
fellowship. We could sit down and have a drink

34:27.618 --> 34:29.661
together. We could have a good meal. You know, we 
separated ourselves so we could make it again. But

34:35.348 --> 34:44.299
I wanted us to, if we're going to fight each other, 
let's do it in a dynamic way or in a sense that We're

34:44.684 --> 34:49.471
not all caught short all the time on short ends of 
the stick. Otherwise, we're just going to fight

34:49.491 --> 34:52.917
with each other. So I wanted us to let our hair down 
and let each other know what we were planning to do,

34:52.937 --> 35:01.991
what we intended to do in our respective city. And 
this way, maybe we could coordinate or cooperate

35:02.011 --> 35:05.777
with many projects. At that time, we were getting 
quite a bit of water coming. a grind and we still get

35:09.811 --> 35:32.393
some but they they had us over the night and we 
resolved them to our satisfaction so we didn't

35:09.811 --> 35:32.393
have too much of a problem but we we had problems and 
uh So we would meet every two months

35:32.896 --> 35:42.826
while I was there. The whole term? Yeah. Five 
years? Yeah. And then, you know, I'd bring a board

35:46.489 --> 35:51.334
and show them the related things that we were 
doing. Or had planned it for what we had done since

35:51.354 --> 35:52.555
the last round. Just to enlighten them. And they, 
in turn, jacked Zuby. And a couple others on the

35:58.340 --> 36:00.482
front. And they did the same thing. And for a while 
there, we had excellent

36:01.583 --> 36:09.332
rapport. I mean, you know, they could start 
something, but, you know, and so that we wouldn't,

36:09.352 --> 36:16.822
you know, you don't want to be cut. Yeah, right. So,

36:17.102 --> 36:31.219
but then along came the open meeting law, and

36:17.102 --> 36:31.219
that ended up affecting everything, and we 
couldn't do that. because he couldn't say things

36:32.093 --> 36:59.316
something without you don't mean maybe something 
you didn't want to pay for a while yet you wanted to

36:32.093 --> 36:59.316
work up the data presented to the people come out 
with a half-cocked idea and that's just like this

36:32.093 --> 36:59.316
way for

36:32.093 --> 36:59.316
the council that's an exception one person was 
before the last vote. And when they had the last

37:04.924 --> 37:15.896
vote on the path, the mayor voted for it away from 
them. I mean, they were influenced by the

37:15.916 --> 37:17.118
Republicans. And they were made by them. And they 
shouldn't do that.

37:25.147 --> 37:30.012
You know, you have a tendency to be influenced by 
people, but sometimes you have to go against the

37:30.751 --> 37:45.847
tide for the betterment

37:30.751 --> 37:45.847
of more

37:30.751 --> 37:45.847
people. And some people are reluctant to do it. 
That's something that I don't know whether they

37:50.533 --> 37:57.600
did right or wrong in this matter before, because I 
didn't know both sides myself sufficiently. Was

37:57.620 --> 37:59.122
it still a possibility that you didn't do it then? 
Oh, well, I'm doing this on my own. Well, a lot of

38:00.468 --> 38:08.239
them are interested in what I find out about the 
city, but I'm doing this on my own. Oh, but the plans

38:08.279 --> 38:11.022
are for sure? Well, they are for now. Oh, for now. 
I'm sure it's fine.

38:22.017 --> 38:25.262
Excuse me, I have an allergy. My nostrils are 
clogged up. Well,

38:31.417 --> 38:44.311
for the most part, yeah. I tried to get over. Now, we 
have this problem, as I explained to you about the

38:45.372 --> 38:49.477
taxing and these things. And it took a while to get 
all these going. You can't do everything, you

38:52.600 --> 38:57.205
know, overnight. It took me a long time

38:59.412 --> 39:22.951
to

38:59.412 --> 39:22.951
write up that

38:59.412 --> 39:22.951
plan. And then I worked up the scheme for the 
library and all of that kind of stuff. I believe

39:25.147 --> 39:30.454
that's all that I have. If there's anything that 
you might want to add, but this has been most

39:30.475 --> 39:40.389
helpful as far as just locating different 
aspects. Well, if there's anything, you know,

39:40.409 --> 39:47.138
when you're writing, if there's anything that you 
come across that you think that might help, let me

39:40.409 --> 39:47.138
know. You know, I may be able to think, or I might be 
able to check on some of the stuff that I have. Oh, I

39:55.714 --> 39:57.536
really appreciate that. Because I've noticed, 
you know, just a little writing that I've done, I

39:57.556 --> 40:08.991
have questions, I have a lot of material, but then 
there's something that I'm used to. Well, you

40:09.011 --> 40:13.737
know, with all the letters that you read in the 
file, the whole story's going to change. That's

40:13.757 --> 40:14.178
right, I know. I know it is. It's like, what's his 
name over at the library?

40:25.204 --> 40:32.031
You know, he's working on a document. He wrote it. 
He's writing a history of Texas sports. Oh, with

40:37.056 --> 40:37.656
David Chapman. Yeah. Yeah, yeah. I worked under 
him. Oh, you did? Uh-huh. Oh, okay. Well, I

40:41.820 --> 40:42.741
provided him with a lot of stuff. And I still 
haven't read what he worked up. Apparently he did a

40:48.559 --> 41:02.232
good job, and he checked a lot of, well, I don't 
know, laboratory, Washington Museum, any other

40:48.559 --> 41:02.232
places. I

41:04.034 --> 41:27.188
have some

41:04.034 --> 41:27.188
material here that goes back to the early days. 
Some other stuff. But I still haven't read that. I

41:28.189 --> 41:28.730
want to get a copy of it. I'd like to see what it says 
on it. and a

41:29.870 --> 41:39.764
little bit of a period of time. I want to see how it 
fits. I mean,

41:42.287 --> 41:51.961
with the

41:42.287 --> 41:51.961
university. Oh, with the university. Oh. Yeah. 
Yeah, but yeah. Oh, just one of these period of

41:53.463 --> 41:54.825
time. I was acting director after five. We

41:56.768 --> 42:18.352
had a very severe fire situation going on in the 
condo. We had all foods out next door. Bones were

42:19.012 --> 42:19.393
burning. The foundation came out and set up the 
canteen, and the Red Cross was out there. The Rocky

42:21.035 --> 42:22.236
Mountains came down and left a spectacular 
splash. the law and they were broadcasting all of

42:23.380 --> 42:30.448
the information. All of the foreign stories, you 
know. I was under the gun from the university and

42:33.492 --> 42:44.806
then the industry, the forest

42:33.492 --> 42:44.806
industry, crying out to do something. All this was 
going on. We were losing personnel that

42:45.406 --> 42:51.574
were going to other agencies and so on. I was just I 
had a hard time. What year?

42:58.106 --> 43:01.751
Was it at the same time you did it? No, I think it was 
before. I was going to say, I hope you wouldn't have

43:02.813 --> 43:10.964
all those troubles all there at one time. Well, I 
did work up, well, I don't want to give a big

43:11.004 --> 43:17.873
difference, but it seems like I've been bragging a 
lot about it. I had

43:19.912 --> 43:39.232
a few brownie

43:19.912 --> 43:39.232
points with him, but he went off while he took a 
brownie point. But he and his office call one day,

43:39.252 --> 43:47.100
they wanted to send them quick and line up on some of 
the things I'd been engaged with. I'm not going

43:48.380 --> 44:09.409
to
