WEBVTT

00:01.550 --> 00:03.812
But somebody needs to. Well, there is some 
activity going, I think, on the history of OMR,

00:03.832 --> 00:19.309
perhaps right this year, because this is their 
30th anniversary, and they're asking people to

00:03.832 --> 00:19.309
write articles, and I wouldn't be surprised at 
what they have. A historian somewhere who's

00:19.329 --> 00:22.673
worrying about this. Well, I think that 
certainly... in the period just after World War

00:28.195 --> 00:36.986
II, there's no question, but the Navy built 
oceanography. It really had, at least in the

00:37.006 --> 00:39.029
United States. And I think one thing, well, there 
just had been no deep water oceanography in the

00:40.270 --> 00:48.881
United States before World War II. And on the other 
hand, after World War II, it grew very, very fast,

00:50.403 --> 00:57.392
and it grew because Well, there were two kinds of 
contributions to the Navy, three kinds of

00:59.026 --> 01:02.931
contributions to the Navy. One was the obvious one 
of providing dollars for research. There was a

01:07.857 --> 01:16.507
second one, which was that there were a lot of 
people who, one way or another, had become

01:07.857 --> 01:16.507
interested in the ocean during World War II by 
being naval officers. And in fact, if you look

01:16.527 --> 01:25.438
around, you'll find a fair fraction of the people 
of my generation in oceanography who were indeed

01:16.527 --> 01:25.438
naval officers or somehow or other got involved in 
either that or were involved in naval research

01:25.688 --> 01:32.535
during World War II. It was just a time when there 
was a lot going on. The third thing that happened

01:35.998 --> 01:40.683
was that the Navy had built a lot of ships during 
World War II. They didn't need them when the war was

01:40.703 --> 01:43.846
over. And so there were a number of institutions 
that were able to put their hands on floating

01:43.866 --> 01:55.358
facilities in the period of the 50s. that they 
never would have, that just plain never would have

01:56.536 --> 02:08.410
existed if it hadn't been for the naval buildup 
during World War II and its subsequent decline

01:56.536 --> 02:08.410
after World War II. We had Navy tugs and things like 
this that we operated as our key research ships in

02:08.430 --> 02:16.199
the early days of the institution. In fact, up 
until, well, this went on long enough that the Navy

02:16.219 --> 02:26.391
began to feel that it had a responsibility for 
providing research ships and went ahead and

02:16.219 --> 02:26.391
started building a whole class of research ships 
And of the ships that Scripps operates right now, a

02:26.995 --> 02:39.487
fair number of them, all the biggest ones, are 
hulls that were provided by the Navy. Navy doesn't

02:39.507 --> 02:42.030
fund the operation in any sense. We have to justify 
the operational funding on the basis of research

02:43.631 --> 02:48.356
programs. And some of those research programs are 
Navy programs, some are National Science

02:48.376 --> 02:51.859
Foundation. But the ships are made available to us 
without any, you know, paying rent or anything of

02:56.138 --> 03:09.049
this kind, they're just plain bailed to the 
institutions, largely on the grounds that the

02:56.138 --> 03:09.049
programs are indeed federal programs and too 
considerable to say they aren't. And I think that

03:09.069 --> 03:17.057
the, this, this is a fairly important kind of 
thing. It's given our Navy a really strong base in

03:17.097 --> 03:25.504
the scientific world and the capability to to do 
things and to call on people for advisory help and

03:26.969 --> 03:42.603
to have a good base of understanding of the ocean 
probably couldn't have existed in any other

03:26.969 --> 03:42.603
way. Really, you look at the different 
populations in the United States, the fisheries

03:42.623 --> 03:55.795
people, the manganese module people, the oil 
people, whatever, and you see that, at least I

03:42.623 --> 03:55.795
think, that if you look at the deep ocean, the major 
consumer of information about the deep ocean is

03:56.045 --> 04:04.617
the United States Navy. And that so that they have a 
vested interest in seeing that there is good work

04:04.637 --> 04:09.564
done. But I think that people who work in the sea 
also have a kind of vested interest in seeing that

04:10.005 --> 04:25.427
the Navy operates in an intelligent manner and so 
have an obligation in return to

04:26.470 --> 04:35.040
conceive good research things and to be sure that 
they are well understood once they're finished.

04:35.060 --> 04:43.389
The ONR has, of course, become more 
mission-oriented rather than

04:35.060 --> 04:43.389
research-oriented in the very recent past, 
actually. Yeah, I guess

04:43.489 --> 04:49.496
that may be one way of saying it. I think I would look 
at it in a little different way. I think what has

04:52.380 --> 04:55.363
happened is that science has grown 
Fantastically. The Office of Naval Research

04:57.184 --> 05:00.570
budget has not grown in pace with this. I don't 
think that ONR in its major oceanographic program

05:01.311 --> 05:10.125
has necessarily become any more applied. It's 
that the field has gotten so big, the options have

05:10.145 --> 05:17.396
gotten so big, and their budget has not increased 
in proportion. So they've had to say, all right,

05:18.098 --> 05:21.503
what are the things we're going to fund? And so out 
of the range of scientific endeavors that they

05:22.057 --> 05:37.359
could pursue in the sea, they have naturally, 
since they can't do everything, they've picked up

05:22.057 --> 05:37.359
the ones that seem to them to have the most 
relevance to nature. There's been a lot of talk

05:37.379 --> 05:50.798
about relevance and there was a manuscript 
amendment game that I felt was used by a lot of

05:37.379 --> 05:50.798
people to cut research budgets rather than to 
improve relevance.

05:55.114 --> 06:01.005
If you said, well, basic research is not relevant, 
then you could cut almost anything. On the other

06:01.026 --> 06:13.410
hand, there's hardly anything you can study in the 
ocean that isn't in some way, a knowledgeable

06:01.026 --> 06:13.410
person can show that it's in some way relevant to 
the

06:01.026 --> 06:13.410
Navy. The question of cutting down oceanographic 
research on the grounds of lack of relevance is

06:13.930 --> 06:20.562
pretty hard to justify. And in fact, if you look at 
what happened to O&R during a period in which that

06:20.582 --> 06:36.732
was really going up, it squeezed its programs, but 
it squeezed the non-ocean programs a great deal

06:20.582 --> 06:36.732
harder than it did the ocean programs. like a third 
of our budget at this point, whereas in other years

06:38.635 --> 06:45.905
there was a lot of nuclear physics and things of 
this sort. And basically I think the decision was

06:45.925 --> 07:03.208
that the Navy would fund fairly heavily in basic 
research areas in which no other

06:45.925 --> 07:03.208
mission-oriented agency in federal government 
had much at stake. And so, this pretty much says

07:04.117 --> 07:24.726
that other people who fund, the earlier people who 
funded nuclear things and uses nuclear power

07:04.117 --> 07:24.726
won't put much money into basic research in that 
category. They'll put a lot into oceanography

07:24.766 --> 07:28.692
because there aren't many other agencies that 
have the radios. Do you think that the funding ONR

07:28.712 --> 07:31.896
did earlier when it just simply gave lump sums to 
institutions to be sort of parceled out to

07:32.281 --> 07:39.210
researchers? Do you think it was more creative 
then than it is now when it asked for specific

07:39.230 --> 07:43.215
proposals? Yes. Well, what's happened over the 
years is that as we've moved from these sort of

07:46.259 --> 08:01.478
block funding things into more and more narrowly 
defined projects,

07:46.259 --> 08:01.478
on the one hand, you find that you The amount of 
paperwork that you have to do for a research dollar

08:03.213 --> 08:14.326
these days has gone up in probably a factor of 10 in 
the last 15 years. It's way, way

08:15.448 --> 08:19.632
up. The other result of what is primarily the 
result of just plain projectizing everything and

08:19.653 --> 08:31.887
cutting it down into smaller and smaller pieces, 
it's around now where In the National Science

08:32.272 --> 08:43.524
Foundation, for example, the average size of 
grant in oceanography has not gone up in the last

08:32.272 --> 08:43.524
half dozen years, in spite of the fact that 
inflation has gone up. And it's clear that to get a

08:43.544 --> 08:47.648
given amount of work done, it costs more money. 
What this means is that people are dividing their

08:47.688 --> 08:51.492
work up into smaller and smaller pieces. And this 
means that the money is compartmentalized, and

08:51.512 --> 09:02.143
you have to plan the spending on each individual 
little project to within a tenth of a percent.

09:07.548 --> 09:13.633
Whereas in other times, I think people may be under 
some misapprehension with regard to this block

09:07.548 --> 09:13.633
funding sort of business. There was always a 
program presented, and certain investigators

09:14.034 --> 09:22.001
were clearly going to be supported. It was not just 
a sort of chunk of money that disappeared into the

09:22.021 --> 09:27.545
director's office and came out the other end 
according to his whim. He had to present a program.

09:30.648 --> 09:32.029
The big advantage was that you were sort of morally 
bound to put the money pretty much the way it went,

09:33.376 --> 09:56.245
but this was sort of to within 90% instead of 99%, 
and that meant that if somebody within your

09:33.376 --> 09:56.245
organization had misjudged his budgetary 
requirements, usually there were about as many

09:33.376 --> 09:56.245
people who misjudged high as low, and you could 
move the money around and compensate for this, and

09:56.562 --> 10:05.294
everybody could get his work done on the way up to 
the hill, and the money would be spent in the most

09:56.562 --> 10:05.294
fruitful manner possible. I think that money is 
not spent as fruitfully when it is divided into

10:06.055 --> 10:12.183
little tiny packages. What about ONR and NSL, in 
effect, encouraging and creating departments of

10:12.203 --> 10:20.033
oceanography? Do you think this was essentially a 
good thing?

10:27.747 --> 10:29.511
And I don't know. Up to a point it certainly was a 
good thing because oceanography had grown and

10:29.531 --> 10:43.059
there was no reason that it should grow only in the 
places where there had been oceanography in 1948

10:29.531 --> 10:43.059
or something like that. So in that sense, there's 
no... it should have been done. It had to be done.

10:50.663 --> 11:05.342
Certainly if you took the three or four big places 
and said that they were going to be now involved in

10:50.663 --> 11:05.342
oceanography by all the academic oceanography, 
they'd be considerably bigger than they are. It's

11:05.563 --> 11:09.488
not clear that the world would be better off 
without them. There was room for more. I think

11:10.850 --> 11:18.780
there was sort of an overdoing of this, and we're 
seeing that now, and I think it's kind of

11:10.850 --> 11:18.780
retrenched. groups are kind of withering and 
dying. I

11:22.309 --> 11:42.372
think that there was no way to know what the optimum 
would be, and so there was an expansion which

11:22.309 --> 11:42.372
became an over-expansion, which now is turning 
into a contraction, which I hope won't become an

11:22.309 --> 11:42.372
over-contraction. Well, in terms of naval 
stimulation of these departments, do you think

11:43.043 --> 11:58.741
possibly scientific research is suffering now 
because of the necessity of ONR in divining its

11:43.043 --> 11:58.741
funds up to a multiplicity of departments rather 
than a few institutions? I don't know. I think that

11:59.222 --> 12:12.477
ONR, I can't speak for ONR, of course, but I think 
that they are gradually adjusting themselves to

11:59.222 --> 12:12.477
the idea that they can't support a large number of 
places and that there is a certain kind of you have

12:14.043 --> 12:36.726
to have a certain dimension before you can operate 
a ship effectively and things of this kind and that

12:14.043 --> 12:36.726
it probably is best to have oceanography done in a 
fairly modest number of fairly good sized places

12:14.043 --> 12:36.726
rather than supporting work. I think this happens 
naturally to some extent in that the people who are

12:37.306 --> 12:41.991
in disadvantaged institutions, institutions 
that are just plain can't quite get up to the

12:42.545 --> 13:00.952
threshold, they can't do as good work and so they 
don't fare as well when proposals are reviewed

12:42.545 --> 13:00.952
because they don't have the facilities and they 
don't have the... Another part of the game is the

12:42.545 --> 13:00.952
strong interaction with other people. I've been 
invited by a variety of places to leave here and go

13:00.972 --> 13:10.746
off and take a job, be director of this or professor 
there or something. And every time I've searched

13:11.519 --> 13:23.993
my soul and stayed here, and one of the major 
reasons I've stayed here has been that there are

13:11.519 --> 13:23.993
people here that I can talk to who are of a caliber 
that I can't find in this kind of quantity if I go off

13:24.884 --> 13:27.927
to some other place. And I enjoy that. I think it 
helps me to do better research. So that's a part of

13:34.993 --> 13:39.077
having a big enough place. A lot of people think 
Scripps has got to be too big. I guess I haven't

13:43.161 --> 13:50.207
heard of anybody who really left because of that 
reason. In fact, most people who are here, even the

13:50.227 --> 13:53.490
ones who say it's too big, would really like to have 
one more post-doctoral fellow, maybe a couple

13:54.078 --> 14:03.551
more graduate students, maybe an electronics 
technician, and so on. There seems always to go

14:03.571 --> 14:06.716
that way. Now that the research facilities, let's 
say, are divided up between NSF and ONR, do you see

14:08.438 --> 14:21.537
several projects which emerge which somehow seem 
to fit neither NSF nor ONR standards, and thus fall

14:22.242 --> 14:25.707
between the cracks of the floor funding, if I may 
use that better? I don't know. I don't really

14:26.929 --> 14:34.320
recognize any major problems in this regard. I 
think that people do... There is a changing

14:37.625 --> 14:41.330
pattern in the sense that people are... There are 
other agencies coming in to work in the ocean,

14:41.350 --> 14:48.581
particularly the near shore part of the ocean. And 
some of them want information about the ocean and

14:52.128 --> 15:10.674
people in the institutions are willing or 
interested in providing that information in

14:52.128 --> 15:10.674
return for the chance to get out to sea and learn 
some things that they would like to know for their

14:52.128 --> 15:10.674
own research.

15:13.899 --> 15:19.266
By and large these other agencies are not as 
skilled for that working with research people, as

15:19.651 --> 15:33.384
the old scenario of search has been historically, 
as NSF, was reasonable. So groups like IRDA and

15:33.404 --> 15:44.635
Bureau of Land Management and so forth find that 
the scientific community finds it a little

15:33.404 --> 15:44.635
difficult to do things truthfully with them. I 
think, and the fault is probably on both sides of

15:44.655 --> 15:49.320
the ledger in the sense that And one thing you do 
have to recognize is that places like in Airplane

15:51.629 --> 15:59.981
Management or whatever have only kind of a 
transient interest in the ocean. They want to find

16:00.101 --> 16:03.365
out about the strip that's right along the coast. 
And once they have that, and while there is a lot to

16:03.606 --> 16:21.130
be learned there, they don't feel in the same sense 
that the Navy does or that people who charge demand

16:03.606 --> 16:21.130
set up with fostering mission are to be, that the 
ocean is something that is their primary

16:21.110 --> 16:23.253
scientific object of interest. There seems 
traditionally ONR and NSF and well now even the

16:25.036 --> 16:45.306
National Academy of Science have drawn the people 
who gave them guidance, allow me to say, from

16:25.036 --> 16:45.306
oceanography, sort of moving the civilians into 
these administrative posts. Do you think that's

16:45.326 --> 16:49.092
good for the military to do that?

16:51.738 --> 16:53.500
I'm not sure exactly what you're talking about. 
Ned Estenzo, Richard Vedder, Finna Jennings.

16:56.804 --> 17:02.191
Yeah, but you say it's good for the military to do 
that. I'm not sure which way we're thinking of the

17:03.232 --> 17:07.398
migration as taking place. A lot of the people, 
some people are people who were in the Navy

17:08.759 --> 17:17.290
establishment, so there is a need out of it. off 
into NSF and other places. If you look around

17:21.210 --> 17:33.988
Washington in the oceanographic administrative 
business, you'll find out that half of the leading

17:21.210 --> 17:33.988
administrators did their first administrative 
work in government in ONR. Gordon Lill, over in the

17:34.008 --> 17:46.787
National Ocean Survey as part of NOAA, was one of 
the leaders in the geophysics branch of ONR way

17:34.008 --> 17:46.787
back in the early 50s. Fina Jennings

17:48.269 --> 17:58.120
was one step after. I mean, two in charge

17:59.461 --> 18:10.013
of that part, Maxwell was her, and then Lil, 
Maxwell, Jennings,

17:59.461 --> 18:10.013
and that part is going on. And Jennings, of course, 
is the IDOU, and they're just, the place is

18:10.033 --> 18:13.436
shotgun. They're in both NSF and NOAA.

18:17.986 --> 18:33.633
I think that I enjoy, in the Navy research 
business, interacting to some extent with the

18:17.986 --> 18:33.633
naval officers as well as with the civilian 
scientists. They take a completely different

18:33.653 --> 18:39.623
viewpoint, and there are times when I appreciate a 
pragmatic viewpoint

18:40.818 --> 19:00.109
and applied viewpoint on some problems, perhaps 
more than some of my colleagues do. I find it's fun

19:00.129 --> 19:01.972
sometimes to try to cope with a problem on the ocean 
or something like that. Test my ingenuity.

19:03.683 --> 19:14.499
There's

19:03.683 --> 19:14.499
been a great deal of pressure. Let me begin by 
asking you a loaded question. There's been a great

19:16.643 --> 19:22.131
deal of pressure in the 60s on the part of young 
scientists in cooperation with the military.

19:22.685 --> 19:26.431
Now, I really can't say, you know, 60% of the 
scientists... Pressure against. Pressure, but I

19:26.832 --> 19:30.097
mean pressure on institutions not to be as 
cooperative with the military. That's right. Did

19:31.379 --> 19:37.889
you, as a scientist coming from the military, ever 
feel this kind of uneasiness in terms of

19:31.379 --> 19:37.889
cooperation with the military?

19:41.975 --> 19:43.418
No, I haven't felt any uneasiness. I guess that's 
partly because of the situation in which I found

19:43.518 --> 19:50.008
myself in that... I guess I sort of went at it with a 
missionary viewpoint. I figured that I had enough

19:54.579 --> 20:12.606
independence sitting in the University of 
California to, and enough audacity, perhaps, to

19:54.579 --> 20:12.606
think that I could influence the military to do 
things in a more sensible way in the areas in which I

19:54.579 --> 20:12.606
understood. And so, and I think that's been true of 
some of the others who have played this game and

20:12.626 --> 20:18.595
have done it, We were really helping to keep the 
military from getting in worse trouble than they

20:25.493 --> 20:28.997
would have gotten into, or something like this. I 
have a lot of respect for a lot of the Navy people.

20:34.464 --> 20:40.992
I've

20:34.464 --> 20:40.992
had practically no contact with Army and Air 
Force-type people. And there are a lot of Navy

20:41.012 --> 20:45.117
people from whom I have a great deal of respect and 
have worked, and I think have worked very

20:41.012 --> 20:45.117
fruitfully. And I think it's been kind of 
unfortunate that that move in the late 60s

20:54.046 --> 21:00.973
Vietnam War and the rest of it and all the other 
things, I think it was strongly the Vietnam War

20:54.046 --> 21:00.973
that made it take that form. But I think that's been 
bad for the country in the sense that their sort of

21:01.854 --> 21:23.395
division sprang up in that the scientists who were 
young in those days developed a standoffish

21:01.854 --> 21:23.395
attitude toward the military, which in the long 
run has meant that they don't have enough

21:01.854 --> 21:23.395
perspective to see what some of the problems are 
that are relevant in the ocean. At the same time, it

21:28.390 --> 21:36.621
developed on the part of the military people a 
reaction that said, well, what the hell with you?

21:36.641 --> 21:46.615
And what that has led to is the growth of the 
in-house Navy laboratories to quite substantial

21:36.641 --> 21:46.615
size, much bigger than they had been before. And 
those laboratories serve their function, they

21:47.354 --> 22:03.097
get things done toward naming, but they don't 
provide much of a back-door kind of aspect, which

21:47.354 --> 22:03.097
is what the academic community can provide. If you 
know enough about the problem and feel some

22:03.117 --> 22:10.948
responsibility for helping to solve it in a 
rational way, you can have a little less

22:11.637 --> 22:15.742
compunction about pointing out when they think 
the other color is doing it the wrong way. People in

22:16.883 --> 22:23.331
the Navy laboratory have very little time seeing 
how to do that. There also have been complaints

22:23.432 --> 22:38.370
rising in the scientific community about the 
interaction of oceanographers in particular

22:23.432 --> 22:38.370
with private enterprise as consultants and so 
forth on the grounds of obviously the ecology and

22:23.432 --> 22:38.370
the oceans. Have you ever felt any uneasiness 
about this sort of association? Well, I don't

22:43.445 --> 22:45.427
know. Not really. I haven't had any of that sort of 
association, particularly myself.

22:57.504 --> 23:05.235
I can't think of any really good examples of people 
I have professional respect for.

23:08.692 --> 23:28.813
running

23:08.692 --> 23:28.813
into any trouble in this recruitment. There are a 
lot of marginal relation archivers who write

23:28.833 --> 23:31.316
environmental impact statements and they do them 
the best they can. And I don't feel that they're

23:31.336 --> 23:32.977
necessarily being pushed or pulled in the right 
way. They're just doing their job. And sometimes,

23:33.598 --> 23:36.541
in fact, I suppose you've got to expect that an 
environmental impact statement may come out in

23:33.598 --> 23:36.541
such a way as to favor the developer. There's this 
sort of possibility. I think

23:40.957 --> 23:48.049
That's not the thing I thought to be particularly 
bothersome. I've been aware of odd situations. I

23:50.975 --> 23:59.269
was sitting on an advisory committee for the 
governor of Alaska for a short period, and I

23:50.975 --> 23:59.269
shouldn't take an advisory committee. that the 
University of Alaska had done a thing that the

24:00.650 --> 24:08.020
University of California had never allowed to 
happen. They took some money from the pipeline

24:08.040 --> 24:22.280
company to do an oceanographic survey in the 
region of Boundies where the tanker port is going

24:08.040 --> 24:22.280
to be at the side of the pipeline. That in itself I 
have no objection to. The thing was, however, that

24:24.043 --> 24:29.070
they were willing to take with the money a 
restriction on the lease of the data to anybody for

24:29.287 --> 24:36.438
five years, something like that. And anybody 
meant even another part of the Alaskan

24:36.458 --> 24:41.185
government. And they found themselves in a very 
awkward position when the Alaskan government

24:41.205 --> 24:49.718
fisheries groups and so forth started doing 
physical oceanography. They had to do the whole

24:50.058 --> 24:51.560
thing over again. They couldn't use the 
University of Alaska data because of the

24:51.581 --> 24:57.910
agreement that had gone with the funding. That's 
the kind of thing that can give the whole game a bad

24:59.155 --> 25:09.345
name, it

24:59.155 --> 25:09.345
seems to me. Now, I want to return to ONR, if I can, 
for a second. In terms of ONR's funding of

25:15.091 --> 25:27.863
projects, was it your experience that the things 
ONR was interested in tended to attract the

25:15.091 --> 25:27.863
scientists to it? Is it the grants themselves, 
sort of predetermined research? Let me try that.

25:41.698 --> 25:42.700
I don't think so. It's always hard to decide. I 
guess I was using some words like basic research

25:47.620 --> 25:50.945
and things like that a while ago. I find those 
really are not very satisfying terms. I think in

25:55.552 --> 26:01.601
fact that one man's basic research can be another 
man's applied research. The doer doesn't have to

26:01.621 --> 26:05.647
even have the same evaluation of it as the sponsor 
does. And

26:07.971 --> 26:12.598
if you run a good institution, why the idea is to see 
that the people who are interested in certain

26:13.000 --> 26:24.234
kinds of things make contact with sponsors who are 
interested in those same kinds of

26:13.000 --> 26:24.234
investigations. That's a kind of idealistic 
picture. It doesn't really work that way, except

26:25.676 --> 26:29.000
perhaps in first order. But nevertheless, that's 
the way it ideally should

26:29.521 --> 26:37.331
work. These days, I think that a scientist is faced 
with enough choices about what to do that you can't

26:44.084 --> 27:00.111
claim that you do a particular experiment just 
because in some abstract way it was more

26:44.084 --> 27:00.111
scientifically interesting.

27:00.732 --> 27:09.467
You're rattled around by your peers in terms of 
what you're working on, and you're rattled around

27:00.732 --> 27:09.467
by the funding agencies in terms of what they're 
interested in putting money in, On top of that,

27:09.903 --> 27:16.737
you're rattled around by just what kinds of tools 
you have or what your own capabilities are. And

27:16.757 --> 27:26.977
with all of those, you have a lot of options as to 
what the next thing is you're going to work on. And

27:26.997 --> 27:31.827
you sort of take a weighted average across all of 
these different things, and sometimes you'll

27:26.997 --> 27:31.827
come up with pushing pretty hard to work on 
something where the funding

27:32.768 --> 27:46.202
doesn't come very easily. Well, it may turn out 
that, in fact, the funding and your own

27:46.322 --> 27:54.170
inclination go in the same direction pretty 
easily. I think that what you wind up with, of

27:54.190 --> 28:01.577
course, is some sort of natural selection in the 
sense that physical oceanographers that are

27:54.190 --> 28:01.577
interested in a particular kind of problem are 
more likely to be supported by O&R than those that

27:54.190 --> 28:01.577
are interested in some other kind of problem. This 
is why I'm very much opposed to various

28:02.637 --> 28:31.497
congressmen's ideas about having a single agency 
for supporting the motion of interest and all

28:02.637 --> 28:31.497
sorts of things, because if there were only one, 
then you'd only have this single monolithic thing

28:02.637 --> 28:31.497
to deal with, and the kind of research we can do 
would lose its sort of resiliency and diversity,

28:02.637 --> 28:31.497
which now exists because you can do certain things 
within our sphere, you can do other things within

28:32.101 --> 28:45.822
the NSF sphere, or either of those, like what you 
want to do, or you can go try your land management,

28:32.101 --> 28:45.822
or geological survey, or whatever. And I think 
we'll have a healthy community as long as we have

28:45.842 --> 28:56.539
this diversity of interests on the part of the 
users, and I think it's a mistake to try to think you

28:45.842 --> 28:56.539
can truthfully take the

29:02.695 --> 29:14.005
the needs of some agency and represent them in some 
other agency and expect this is going to have any

29:02.695 --> 29:14.005
fruitful result. But if an agency needs to know 
about the ocean, it needs to have some people

29:14.025 --> 29:24.995
working for it who in fact know about the ocean and 
are trying to learn about the ocean. And this

29:25.015 --> 29:32.162
almost means that even within the Navy, I have 
regretted some of the moves that they've taken to

29:25.015 --> 29:32.162
try to centralize oceanography. I think that 
there's a limit to how far you should go in that

29:32.615 --> 29:36.721
regard. You really should leave some of the 
oceanography scattered out around because it'll

29:36.741 --> 29:42.890
be used better. It's just lying there on the desk 
next to you. If you sit in a building where there's

29:45.254 --> 29:51.383
oceanography, you're more likely to think about 
the ocean.
