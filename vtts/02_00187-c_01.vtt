WEBVTT

00:03.102 --> 00:11.195
The changes that were made in the 70s and 80s were very important.

00:12.136 --> 00:23.775
Did we miss, as far as you can tell, in geology, did we miss any opportunities that we might have taken on in the last 20, 30 years?

00:24.736 --> 00:26.559
Are there some things we failed to do?

00:27.821 --> 00:28.502
Well,

00:29.427 --> 00:33.691
I'm one of these people who thinks that a department has to have a focus.

00:35.353 --> 00:39.117
And our department, Geology and Geophysics, does not.

00:40.298 --> 00:50.489
And in fact, I'm the chairman of a committee that's called the Committee on Revitalization and Renewal.

00:53.332 --> 00:55.114
And it's related to

00:57.372 --> 01:07.996
A course that I took that was sponsored by the College of Education regarding that same thing in education.

01:08.016 --> 01:09.880
Is that comedian now?

01:10.872 --> 01:12.395
That committee is functioning?

01:13.076 --> 01:22.093
Well, it hasn't met this year yet, but the last time we met was on trying to get a focus for a department.

01:22.113 --> 01:24.778
One time, they wanted to focus.

01:24.979 --> 01:28.526
The next time, the group had decided they didn't.

01:29.588 --> 01:31.952
And I think, well, see,

01:31.932 --> 01:33.455
Now, here's one of the things.

01:34.156 --> 01:44.293
Geology at LSU is rated fairly high because they have a focus on the coast and coastal features.

01:46.276 --> 01:52.106
If you were the decision maker, what focus would you try to have our department make?

01:54.110 --> 01:56.033
I think continental margins.

01:56.941 --> 02:02.369
because that would include almost everybody in the department could aim their things towards that.

02:04.312 --> 02:17.190
Because this would include the people that are interested in plate tectonics and also the people that are interested in shorelines and what happens to shorelines under various conditions.

02:17.671 --> 02:25.542
And the possibilities for teaching and research in that would be, there'd be opportunity for that.

02:25.963 --> 02:26.323
Yeah.

02:27.603 --> 02:30.869
But I don't know.

02:30.929 --> 02:34.615
See, the conventional department has no focus.

02:37.019 --> 02:42.268
I don't know that the University of Texas does, but they have one event.

02:42.749 --> 02:50.843
They have the Bureau of Economic Geology associated with them.

02:54.265 --> 02:58.190
And it ends up that, well, they've had some advantage over there.

02:58.231 --> 03:01.235
They have been good at raising money.

03:03.238 --> 03:15.214
Now, Bob Boyer, when he was department head of the Department of Geology over there, the reason he got to be dean was he raised money for the department.

03:16.556 --> 03:22.264
From what were their primary sources of funding?

03:23.122 --> 03:28.422
their graduates, if you're working for Exxon.

03:28.663 --> 03:29.044
Okay.

03:29.667 --> 03:34.465
And Exxon Matches, when

03:37.212 --> 03:39.356
Gosh, I forget people's names.

03:40.137 --> 03:52.879
I have a first-name basis with him, too, because he was the president of Exxon Corporation, a UT graduate that sent him off to Harvard Business College after he was working with Exxon.

03:54.102 --> 04:02.376
And he became president when he was in charge of Exxon, if you were a UT employee.

04:03.014 --> 04:06.418
All your donations to UT went through him.

04:06.578 --> 04:08.821
If it were inadequate, he sent it back.

04:13.907 --> 04:14.147
See?

04:14.748 --> 04:20.876
Now, one of the biggest changes that came into my life was the darn SIMS computer.

04:21.917 --> 04:24.099
Hold on.

04:24.240 --> 04:28.785
We're talking about opportunities and emphasis and so forth.

04:29.980 --> 04:41.307
In hindsight, were there any chances to get real funding that A&M might have gotten, but for somehow we stumbled and didn't get them?

04:42.468 --> 04:50.100
Well, see, we've had a lot of people come in to look at chairs, and they have turned them down.

04:50.140 --> 05:02.839
And some of them I got to know later when I became a counselor for the Geological Society of America.

05:02.819 --> 05:19.680
One of the things is that people in our department have not been very oriented to help run some of these organizations.

05:20.941 --> 05:25.286
In terms of engineering, geology, yes, we've been active there.

05:25.427 --> 05:30.733
But in terms, in other words, I,

05:32.114 --> 05:41.363
was the only counselor ever from this university on the governing council of the Geological Society of America.

05:42.625 --> 05:48.851
And Gordon Eaton, after he left here, became a counselor.

05:50.553 --> 05:51.934
But he didn't while he was here.

05:53.135 --> 05:56.799
Now, was he a, is he a geologist?

05:56.819 --> 05:58.641
Gordon Eaton, yeah.

05:58.661 --> 06:00.703
Because, now he came here as dean?

06:02.084 --> 06:03.606
Or did he come here as a faculty member?

06:03.686 --> 06:05.068
No, he came here as dean.

06:05.568 --> 06:05.809
Okay.

06:06.349 --> 06:09.633
He'd been with the U.S.

06:09.653 --> 06:13.178
Geological Survey and was fairly high up in the survey.

06:13.218 --> 06:20.246
And then he left here to go to be, I think, the University of Iowa president.

06:20.266 --> 06:20.787
Iowa State.

06:21.448 --> 06:23.130
Iowa State, yeah.

06:23.110 --> 06:34.223
And then to the Institute, Coastal Research Institute at Columbia.

06:34.243 --> 06:38.508
And then from there, I think he went to head the U.S.

06:38.528 --> 06:40.591
Theological Survey as a director.

06:41.912 --> 06:49.962
He was in that period when the survey was going to be abolished by Congress.

06:51.173 --> 06:57.823
And he managed to get things straightened out, although it cost a lot of geologists their jobs.

06:59.726 --> 07:04.773
So there were a lot of people that didn't like him there in the survey.

07:04.794 --> 07:08.279
Let's emphasize, let's go back to your, all of your accomplishments.

07:08.319 --> 07:11.764
Now you've been here 40 years.

07:12.638 --> 07:13.219
Since 54.

07:13.239 --> 07:15.642
46, 47 years.

07:15.722 --> 07:16.563
Yeah.

07:17.905 --> 07:21.990
Of what are you most proud for all those years?

07:22.791 --> 07:27.077
Well, I think my teacher training programs.

07:27.097 --> 07:35.828
In other words, I can go to a teacher meeting and a teacher will run up and throw her arms around me and say,

07:38.288 --> 07:40.971
That's great.

07:41.312 --> 07:43.174
Did you read that article in Eagle?

07:45.077 --> 07:47.520
There's some very complimentary things in there.

07:48.401 --> 07:56.211
And essentially, my wife says, it shows the essence of your character and personality.

07:58.654 --> 08:01.377
Now, this...

08:02.740 --> 08:07.050
Hall of Fame, what is that honor called that you just received?

08:07.070 --> 08:10.558
Well, I was inducted into the Texas Science Hall of Fame.

08:10.698 --> 08:14.146
Now, this is the second year of it.

08:14.166 --> 08:19.939
The first year, well, Kilby

08:20.662 --> 08:27.631
One of our distinguished profs is in it, and he got a Nobel Prize as laureate this year.

08:28.473 --> 08:34.300
Most of them were from University of Texas and Nobel Prize winners.

08:34.801 --> 08:38.186
How many have been inducted each year, do you know?

08:38.666 --> 08:41.911
Well, nine this year and about 12 last year.

08:41.991 --> 08:44.454
So there's 21 people in it.

08:44.474 --> 08:49.521
And, of course, last year...

08:51.543 --> 08:52.485
Let's see.

08:53.648 --> 08:55.934
DeBakey is in it and Cooley.

08:56.837 --> 08:58.722
Splendid company.

08:58.742 --> 09:05.479
And this year, the Texas Aggie that makes no doubt use the Texas Aggie, Red Duke.

09:06.121 --> 09:06.261
Mm-hmm.

09:07.625 --> 09:18.178
and somebody that's in there for helping change the educational standards, and therefore science education in our state, H. Ross Perot.

09:18.999 --> 09:23.044
So those are the two top outstanding.

09:23.084 --> 09:32.535
There are a couple other Nobel laureates in the group, and there are probably more physicians

09:32.836 --> 09:37.910
medical people in that group, about five, six of them.

09:37.931 --> 09:39.415
Are you the only geologist?

09:39.635 --> 09:42.604
The only and first.

09:42.624 --> 09:47.959
How did you learn, my curiosity, how did you learn that you were going to be selected?

09:48.057 --> 09:49.178
or had been selected?

09:49.779 --> 09:55.366
A letter that I got in the mail in October telling me that I had been selected.

09:56.107 --> 09:57.308
Was it a total surprise?

09:57.449 --> 09:58.009
Yes.

09:58.029 --> 09:58.730
Oh, how nice.

09:59.111 --> 10:00.973
How nice.

10:01.313 --> 10:06.640
Well, I have a suspicion who nominated me and who pushed it.

10:06.660 --> 10:12.507
It's a teacher that I had in my program by the name of Christina Comer, who's mentioned in that article.

10:12.688 --> 10:13.248
How good.

10:13.308 --> 10:16.292
And essentially,

10:18.820 --> 10:35.378
She worked with the AAAS, Provence Program in Science Education, a 2061 project mainly designed to help middle school science teachers, and started working with it.

10:35.498 --> 10:45.148
And eventually, she's now the director of science education for the Texas Education Agency.

10:46.462 --> 10:59.060
And one of the problems that you have there is that you not only got to be interested in teachers, you got to be a politician also.

10:59.260 --> 11:16.384
So I suspect that with her political influence deciding that I was worthy of this, there's only one other person before me, Dr. Scog from Texas Tech.

11:16.364 --> 11:21.670
He's in the science education, in the college education there.

11:22.351 --> 11:31.602
But he got it for his method of trying to get biology teachers to present evolution.

11:33.103 --> 11:39.891
So, and that is where essentially he... Now, you still teach a class.

11:40.647 --> 11:46.840
for this semester only, and I'm retiring completely.

11:47.421 --> 11:51.269
Do you have any idea how many students you have had in all your classes?

11:53.433 --> 11:54.195
How many thousands?

11:54.235 --> 11:55.197
Have any idea?

11:56.712 --> 12:02.081
Well, I know that in the summer programs, I've touched about 1,500 teachers.

12:02.101 --> 12:03.203
1,500 teachers.

12:03.223 --> 12:08.872
Now, I don't know how many teachers they've directly touched indirectly, but sure.

12:09.553 --> 12:21.252
Because normally, we also had labs that were investigative type labs so that they can take the lab problems back and share with other teachers how to do certain things.

12:21.232 --> 12:24.675
in the lab with certain exercises.

12:25.195 --> 12:31.421
So, and you don't know how many thousands of students have been affected by it, so.

12:34.063 --> 12:41.750
You gave, a while ago, you gave your thoughts about the department being focused.

12:42.330 --> 12:51.238
Let's make believe now you're a consultant to the Dean of Geoscience

12:51.472 --> 12:59.807
the provost, what advice would you give them about the college and about A&M academics in general?

13:00.648 --> 13:03.794
Make believe you're the expert that they're seeking your advice.

13:03.814 --> 13:06.679
What advice would you give them for A&M's future?

13:10.591 --> 13:21.488
Well, one, we got prepared for what is happening to our public schools because they provide our students.

13:21.548 --> 13:30.743
And regardless of what any governor or president says, we're going downhill.

13:32.731 --> 13:40.820
Testing may be fine, but they are teaching to the test, and they're not teaching the material.

13:42.602 --> 13:51.832
And there is a program that's being run at Rice by Dr. Linda Knight.

13:53.534 --> 13:58.840
It's in conjunction with the Houston ISD, with Houston ISD.

13:59.309 --> 14:21.115
may run the program, but they don't utilize what's coming out of it, and that is they take a teacher away from their environment for a whole year and put them through this program, which essentially tries to teach science by the investigative approach.

14:24.098 --> 14:31.874
The minute you get back in your school, the principal will tell you he wants you to teach for that test.

14:31.894 --> 14:35.562
And so you can't teach the way you teach there.

14:35.862 --> 14:41.334
So I think we got to be prepared for that.

14:42.155 --> 14:44.841
There'd been a lot of complaints by

14:46.795 --> 14:56.228
people in our department that the students they get are not well prepared in high school, either math or science or this.

14:56.588 --> 15:10.407
Well, I was trying to do my part, but the status when I started was better than it is now.

15:11.450 --> 15:16.107
You think the students that you had 40 years ago were better prepared than the ones you have now?

15:18.496 --> 15:19.500
Coming from high school?

15:20.022 --> 15:20.363
Yes.

15:22.317 --> 15:28.028
And they—but that's one of the facts of life.

15:28.068 --> 15:29.110
You got to deal with it.

15:29.150 --> 15:37.366
And this may be true countrywide, because I think all the school systems and all the states are having this problem.

15:37.386 --> 15:41.794
See, the minute you get a situation where you have—

15:41.774 --> 15:46.081
low unemployment, and there's a lot of employment around.

15:46.642 --> 15:51.830
Since teachers are poorly paid, you don't get the people going into teaching.

15:53.092 --> 16:03.969
And so about the only ones you get going into teaching are those that can't do anything else or those that are really devoted to teachers.

16:03.989 --> 16:06.853
And there's a lot of them that are really devoted to it.

16:08.150 --> 16:13.296
But they're getting tarred with the same brush as the others.

16:14.238 --> 16:27.554
And when you get down to where 30% of your science teachers are not certified, 50% of your math teachers are not certified, you have a real problem.

16:28.856 --> 16:34.663
And so they aren't passing the test, but the test is a fairly easy one.

16:35.318 --> 16:54.726
So what I'm looking at is we got to prepare to meet that challenge and we may have to have more remedial courses and we ought to be prepared for it because otherwise we're not going to put out the product we need to put out.

16:55.287 --> 17:03.098
And I'm not so sure the product isn't going downhill that we're putting out, but I can't be sure of that.

17:03.989 --> 17:15.894
All right, also looking back over these 45, six years, what were two or three of the happiest moments for you in all of that time?

17:18.720 --> 17:20.023
Proudest, happiest.

17:23.159 --> 17:27.163
Well, certainly wasn't when my first wife died.

17:27.183 --> 17:28.364
That was a low point.

17:29.505 --> 17:33.969
And when she was in the nursing home, that was a very low point in my life.

17:39.154 --> 17:45.921
Well, I would say this award was something that really, because it's something very special.

17:46.181 --> 17:46.622
Oh, yes.

17:47.142 --> 17:50.145
All right, do you remember some amusing moments, funny?

17:52.994 --> 17:54.837
Well, let me put it this way.

17:57.260 --> 18:10.720
When somebody comes back to me, like a bus driver, and say, I've taken Clay Sleward to a liquor store, and just as he got out under the sign over the liquor store, he got hit by lightning.

18:13.163 --> 18:13.804
That was a

18:15.826 --> 18:18.531
A moment that I... That really happened?

18:18.851 --> 18:19.452
Yes.

18:19.473 --> 18:22.177
This was one of those first black students?

18:22.658 --> 18:24.001
No, Clay Seward.

18:24.381 --> 18:25.303
Oh, oh, oh.

18:25.864 --> 18:30.552
The bus driver had taken him to a liquor store to get... This is in Lano, Texas.

18:30.572 --> 18:31.354
Yes, yes, yes, yes.

18:31.374 --> 18:33.077
We happened to have a thunderstorm.

18:33.097 --> 18:33.978
Yes, yes.

18:34.880 --> 18:36.122
Okay, that's a good one.

18:36.743 --> 18:40.450
Did any of the students ever attempt to play a joke on you in class?

18:44.311 --> 18:51.623
No, but one place at one motel that I was in on a field trip, I opened up the door and I couldn't see out of it.

18:53.226 --> 18:55.450
Most of these motel doors open inside.

18:58.876 --> 19:02.382
They put a heavy craft paper over it and a sign outside.

19:02.442 --> 19:04.345
I don't know what the sign said.

19:04.696 --> 19:09.762
The only reason I went out is because there was a fire in the motel and the fire engine had drove up.

19:09.782 --> 19:11.384
I wanted to see what was going on.

19:11.404 --> 19:13.086
And the kids had papered over the door?

19:13.546 --> 19:30.366
And then there was a group that, an academic year group, you see, because I had groups during the year, that we led a, had a field trip that went over part of Christmas vacation.

19:31.780 --> 19:36.128
And so we had gone out, and we were staying at Alpine.

19:37.691 --> 19:51.797
And unfortunately, I didn't know that one of the teachers in my group had a teacher friend in there, and the teacher friend

19:54.173 --> 20:01.782
and the son that was in the police department at Alpine, and they happened to get together.

20:01.882 --> 20:07.248
So the son in the police car came out to this motel.

20:08.369 --> 20:11.233
I had told them about this story.

20:11.273 --> 20:17.180
This happened under Travis Parker, where a field camp was out in Alpine.

20:17.220 --> 20:21.885
They'd gone up and arranged the SR of rocks

20:22.338 --> 20:24.743
to an A&M on the handle about it.

20:25.465 --> 20:36.009
The only problem was that there was a big turmoil and the police were called out and some of them got arrested.

20:36.049 --> 20:41.241
Rocks never got changed to, well, some of them got partially changed.

20:42.318 --> 20:46.624
So on that particular day, I told them this story.

20:46.684 --> 20:57.739
And so they said that they had been up on the hill looking at the Comet, Kuatek, but they came to my door, knocked on it.

20:58.179 --> 21:01.684
The police guard was out there with the lights flashing and all of that.

21:01.704 --> 21:04.528
And you thought they were going to be coming to get you?

21:04.508 --> 21:10.558
No, I thought that, but they came down, and guess who they sent down?

21:10.578 --> 21:13.963
We had a sister, a Catholic sister in that program.

21:14.444 --> 21:26.803
They sent down her to tell this lie, that they'd been up looking for the comet Kuwatek on the hill and been picked up for the police because they thought they were going to rearrange the stones.

21:28.420 --> 21:32.026
I thought it had happened.

21:36.152 --> 21:38.856
All right, I've got a couple more questions.

21:39.197 --> 21:44.265
Do you think of any important topics about your career in geology we haven't touched?

21:45.487 --> 21:51.576
Is there anything we've left out that we should have covered?

21:53.176 --> 22:00.951
I, in mongeology, I organized the south central section of the Geological Society of America.

22:01.192 --> 22:05.340
It's now been 35 years or so.

22:05.560 --> 22:06.382
Oh, that's good.

22:07.223 --> 22:15.319
And I mentioned this at a meeting in Fayetteville last spring in April.

22:17.071 --> 22:18.893
The next morning I had to stroke.

22:21.297 --> 22:42.505
But the thing is, as I pointed out there, Bob Boyer was on the council at that time, the Geological Society of America, and they wanted to finish organizing the sections, and there was North Central and South Central needed to be formed.

22:43.987 --> 22:52.065
And so there were a couple of us in there, and when Bob said it was going to take a lot of work to get this organized, well, I said I'd help out.

22:52.827 --> 22:55.593
The other fellow that was there, sorry, I don't have the time.

22:55.753 --> 22:56.956
So I was the only one.

22:56.996 --> 23:02.248
And George Rapp organized the North Central.

23:03.140 --> 23:05.864
So it took about, oh, six months.

23:07.045 --> 23:18.601
We had to work up some bylaws and this type of thing, and then had to end up by selecting what states would be in.

23:19.943 --> 23:29.316
And, like, Missouri decided to go to North Central instead of this.

23:31.000 --> 23:44.487
So as a result, we ended up with what states were going to be in, and we had to put a petition to the council with a group of prospective officers.

23:46.711 --> 23:56.244
I got nominated for two positions with a tie vote, and I said, well, I'd better be Secretary of Treasurer and get this thing going off the board.

23:56.284 --> 24:01.270
And Steve Clavaugh became chairman of the section.

24:01.290 --> 24:02.893
He was from the University of Texas.

24:04.114 --> 24:05.496
We held our first meeting.

24:06.725 --> 24:08.307
in Norman, Oklahoma.

24:10.249 --> 24:19.902
And, of course, one of the people that helped us was Charlie Mankin, who was the state geologist for Oklahoma, was then, still is now.

24:21.704 --> 24:23.506
And Charlie is a unique person.

24:23.526 --> 24:25.589
He's a graduate of the University of Texas.

24:25.749 --> 24:33.719
But he will always be the state geologist, although it's a political appointee.

24:33.739 --> 24:35.061
The reason he will be

24:36.290 --> 24:41.178
is that he knows all the important politicians in the state.

24:41.198 --> 24:45.284
Has a private plane, visits all the localities.

24:45.304 --> 24:50.272
So as a result, that's it.

24:50.312 --> 24:53.497
So we got the first meeting off the ground.

24:53.517 --> 24:55.420
The second meeting put us in the red.

24:56.402 --> 25:02.392
It was run up by SMU in the Hilton Hotel in downtown Dallas.

25:02.412 --> 25:03.293
And back then,

25:04.859 --> 25:07.886
Coffee in a hotel, $1.25 a cup.

25:09.690 --> 25:13.178
So the coffee ran us in the red.

25:13.198 --> 25:23.863
All right, then my next to last question is, if someone gave you a million dollar check,

25:24.873 --> 25:38.659
with only one requirement to it, that you pass that check on to Texas A&M, but you could decide what use A&M would make with that gift, what would you have them do with it?

25:38.679 --> 25:43.067
In other words, if you could make a very generous gift to Texas A&M,

25:43.402 --> 25:44.965
What would be your favorite?

25:45.445 --> 25:54.260
Well, my wife and I made a gift of $25,000 with a matching $25,000 here recently for scholarships.

25:54.660 --> 25:55.161
For whom?

25:55.321 --> 25:56.303
Undergraduate.

25:56.323 --> 25:56.984
In what area?

25:57.144 --> 25:58.547
Earth science.

25:58.567 --> 25:59.027
In what?

25:59.047 --> 26:00.249
Earth science, okay.

26:00.370 --> 26:02.874
So if they're not earth science, then geology.

26:02.894 --> 26:08.683
But this, I would provide it in scholarship money for education.

26:10.317 --> 26:13.505
Depends on what field I was interested in.

26:13.525 --> 26:19.661
And how would you select the winners of scholarships for incoming freshmen?

26:21.726 --> 26:23.371
Would it be sheer grades?

26:23.692 --> 26:25.035
Grades, yes.

26:26.585 --> 26:27.567
That's the way I'd go.

26:28.448 --> 26:31.754
However, let's put it this way.

26:31.954 --> 26:36.683
I worked on a library when I worked my way through college.

26:37.564 --> 26:38.947
I worked 30 hours a week.

26:39.828 --> 26:42.653
It costs you a letter grade.

26:42.633 --> 26:44.796
And you don't have time to do much.

26:44.856 --> 26:50.023
The only time is I met my first wife, so I started dating her.

26:50.724 --> 26:52.346
You can guess what happened to the grades.

26:54.569 --> 26:58.975
I was on probation.

27:00.177 --> 27:04.783
So PhDs can be on probation too sometime in their life.

27:04.803 --> 27:11.813
All right, my last question then is, what feelings do you hold for Texas A&M in your heart?

27:13.430 --> 27:21.599
I'm not an Aggie, but I'll always be... I like A&M.

27:21.819 --> 27:24.102
But you didn't finish the sentence.

27:24.382 --> 27:25.363
I'll always be what?

27:26.304 --> 27:29.608
Well, I can't be an Aggie, but I always like to be an Aggie.

27:29.728 --> 27:29.928
Oh, okay.

27:30.148 --> 27:31.630
All right.

27:31.650 --> 27:32.491
No.

27:32.511 --> 27:39.238
And I always go out and watch the band when we lose the football game.

27:40.480 --> 27:42.762
The band always is a good band.

27:43.720 --> 27:46.643
and there's no other marching band like it in the world.

27:50.126 --> 27:54.550
Now, what causes you to have this great pride and love for A&M?

27:55.551 --> 27:57.132
We're continuing that last question.

27:57.593 --> 27:59.414
Why do you feel this way about A&M?

28:03.818 --> 28:12.546
Well, I think it's mainly the students that I've encountered in all of this, because most of them have been very appreciative of

28:15.952 --> 28:17.949
of becoming earth science teachers.

28:19.543 --> 28:20.511
That's a good place to end.
