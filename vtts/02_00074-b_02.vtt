and supportive, it didn't mean we didn't have to do 
our work. When you gave in a community, whether it

00:07.453 --> 00:19.928
was running for school board or whether it was 
being president of the San Antonio M Club or

00:07.453 --> 00:19.928
getting the opportunity to serve on the 
association board or all the other, it's a step

00:07.453 --> 00:19.928
ladder. You see the origin back when a lot of things 
that you do, you take a left or a right, Happened in

00:26.845 --> 00:29.048
the year 18, 19, 20. To me, that left-right was when 
I went to say thank you to Mr. Zachary. My father was

00:35.539 --> 00:38.543
Mr. Zachary Barber. But I didn't know the 
gentleman. I didn't ask him for a job. I asked one of

00:42.490 --> 00:43.972
the vice presidents. Now, Zachary was class of 20 
or 22. from uvalde and did he then he was in laredo

00:48.158 --> 01:02.783
before he came to after after he graduated he 
started his business in laredo and then came up

00:48.158 --> 01:02.783
here and he moved his offices here he made me class 
24. okay 22 or 24. i think it's 22. 22 yeah i believe

01:02.803 --> 01:12.259
so because i think he and dr harrington are same 
class all right last question what feelings do you

01:02.803 --> 01:12.259
hold in your heart for a m today

01:18.348 --> 01:35.794
You know, Haskell,

01:18.348 --> 01:35.794
it's extremely hard to talk about feelings like 
that without

01:18.348 --> 01:35.794
tremendous emotion. It's just

01:35.874 --> 01:42.624
part of the training that you take with you.

01:46.790 --> 01:47.511
Let's quit on that.
