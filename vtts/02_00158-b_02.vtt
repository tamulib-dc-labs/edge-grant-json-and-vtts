WEBVTT

00:02.697 --> 00:04.820
Did you go to the Baptist Church your first year? 
That's when I was living in town. And we went to

00:08.826 --> 00:10.849
First Baptist Church downtown. I see. First 
Baptist Church in O'Brien. And then the second

00:13.613 --> 00:14.674
year? When I moved out onto the campus, we went to 
the First Baptist Church in College Station. Were

00:22.846 --> 00:27.032
there Sunday night activities for college 
students? Not necessarily. They were just pretty

00:28.895 --> 00:30.257
general activities. And about, did many students 
go to church? I don't recall a whole bunch did.

00:39.721 --> 00:45.667
Actually, the pastor at the First Baptist Church 
was our guy who married us. Ah. So you married a

00:46.968 --> 00:48.790
Baptist? Yes. Well, really, she was a Methodist 
when we got married, and she joined the Baptist

00:50.191 --> 00:53.895
Church. Well, you converted her. Yeah. I guess God 
did that.

01:03.042 --> 01:03.563
Let's see. There weren't any girls

01:04.824 --> 01:18.283
on the campus.

01:23.830 --> 01:32.442
When the war was over and the students came back, do 
you remember that it was any... Did, were the

01:33.940 --> 01:36.825
courses harder or easier? Did you have to study any 
more? Well, actually, I think probably before I

01:40.511 --> 01:46.321
probably would take, say, 16, 18 hours. But in my 
senior year, it seemed like I had 21 hours. You

01:51.390 --> 01:55.797
know, so it seemed to have been easier to come by 
than it was before. Do you remember who you turned

01:56.519 --> 02:00.584
to after the war for any advice? If you needed 
academic advice or counseling? Well, not

02:05.810 --> 02:07.873
officially, I'd say. But unofficially, who'd you 
go to see? Well, this man in economics that I

02:11.537 --> 02:19.287
couldn't remember his name, he and I were more like 
friends than student and teacher. And where was

02:20.468 --> 02:22.490
economics in those days? Was it in Nagel Hall? I 
don't recall that an academic

02:25.628 --> 02:33.519
building is where everything was taken care of. 
Most of that type of course was handled in an

02:33.999 --> 02:39.426
academic building. Let's see. Some of the A&M 
traditions. Do you remember when you first went to

02:44.693 --> 02:49.079
a Silver Taps event? Well, I can remember going to 
one, but I don't remember when. Was it before the

02:54.006 --> 02:55.568
war or after? It seemed like it was after the war. 
And we went out and stood in front of an academic

03:00.373 --> 03:04.097
building in the middle of the night. And it was a 
rather solemn time. What were your feelings as you

03:11.086 --> 03:13.630
walked back to your room? I can't remember.

03:19.637 --> 03:24.964
Did you by chance go to that famous 1946 muster when 
Eisenhower spoke?

03:29.720 --> 03:40.577
April 21, 1946,

03:29.720 --> 03:40.577
General Eisenhower came here to speak, and they 
had some of the survivors of the Corregidor

03:29.720 --> 03:40.577
muster. No, I didn't attend that. I'm sure I would 
have remembered. But I think they did it over at the

03:45.225 --> 03:48.029
MSC, did they not? I think so. Out there in front? I 
think so. In the drill field? I think so.

03:57.023 --> 04:01.570
But see, since you weren't in the Corps, you didn't 
go through final review. When did you get your

04:02.751 --> 04:04.193
senior ring? I think before I went into service, I 
think I was already a classified junior. I can't

04:12.085 --> 04:13.367
remember exactly. But anyway, you don't make 
rings like this anymore. You know, this is a

04:16.211 --> 04:18.815
14-karat thing. And all my... insignia is 
practically worn off. And I thought about sending

04:24.362 --> 04:30.970
it back in, but it wouldn't have the same 
connotation anymore. And what class are you?

04:35.015 --> 04:35.475
Class of 44. 44, okay. I got out in 47. Yes, sir, I 
understand. But I still have my class of 44. I think

04:42.764 --> 04:47.269
that's, you start off from your freshman year, you 
count that one. How much did that ring cost? Seemed

04:50.568 --> 04:51.289
like $37. Do you have any good ring stories? Well, 
when I first came down here, I had a friend from up in

04:56.537 --> 05:03.227
Collin County, and he and I were close. And he was 
already a junior, and he used to let me wear his

05:04.228 --> 05:10.117
ring. It was unofficial, you know, because you're 
not supposed to let anybody wear the ring. It

05:16.466 --> 05:17.748
doesn't earn it. Did... Did you ever lose your 
ring? Yes. I didn't lose it for long, but I lost it.

05:27.033 --> 05:34.424
We'd been on a trip to see my family up in North 
Texas, and that's when the roads up there were

05:27.033 --> 05:34.424
two-lane roads and went through the country, you 
know. And so I was wearing my ring. We was coming

05:37.409 --> 05:45.621
home in the morning from my sister's house down one 
of these country roads, and my ring got pretty

05:37.409 --> 05:45.621
onerous. You sweat out of there, and it burned and 
everything, so... I was trying to get it off while I

05:48.820 --> 05:52.645
was driving, so I was pushing on it like this. And 
this car, the cars out there had this little vents,

05:53.246 --> 05:56.831
you know, on the side. And I pushed that thing off 
and it bounced around on the dashboard and flew out

05:58.153 --> 06:03.380
the window. And we were doing probably 50, 60 miles 
an hour. So, boy, I stopped and I didn't know how far

06:08.066 --> 06:12.853
down the road I had driven. But we drove back and the 
boys were, you know, within five and six or

06:14.015 --> 06:19.524
something like that. So I said, I got to find that 
ring. So there's not much traffic on that road. So

06:25.554 --> 06:32.866
all of us were walking up and down and over on the 
side was a plowed field, you know, and on the other

06:25.554 --> 06:32.866
side was a plowed field. And so we walked along 
there for about 30 minutes and nobody found the

06:33.887 --> 06:37.273
ring. So I said to my wife, well, we just, not like, 
We're not ever going to find it. Maybe somebody

06:42.255 --> 06:44.417
sent it to me and looked my name in there. So I guess 
I'm going to walk right down here, and if I don't

06:45.358 --> 06:53.188
find that ring along somewhere down that way, 
we're going to have to go. So I walked down as far as I

06:53.228 --> 06:56.933
thought I should go. I turned around to go back, and 
I stepped on my ring. Oh, good, good. Not in the

07:02.840 --> 07:06.364
middle of the road, man. Have you ever been 
somewhere unusual and somebody recognized it? I

07:10.977 --> 07:11.938
do that all the time. My wife's in a nursing home, 
incidentally. And they have little people come

07:15.382 --> 07:24.110
in, you know, not employees or anything, but maybe 
from the church or someplace. And so I was walking

07:24.971 --> 07:29.255
through the lobby one day, and there's two little 
girls there. One of them said, oh, there's a naggy!

07:33.277 --> 07:51.387
very good for real for any all of a sudden you know 
and that happens lots of times are you a graduate

07:33.277 --> 07:51.387
A&M no sir i went to austin college undergraduate 
and rice my phd is that a rice ring yes no that's an

07:33.277 --> 07:51.387
austin college ring oh it is And I'm sorry that at 
many schools today, rings are now old-fashioned.

07:58.522 --> 08:03.068
At many colleges, the kids don't buy rings 
anymore. They think that's out of date. Yeah, and I

08:07.775 --> 08:10.078
think it's splendid.

08:13.944 --> 08:18.370
What are the things that build Aggie pride? What 
makes Aggies so proud of this institution? Well,

08:21.749 --> 08:27.156
we get the cream of the crop students, for one 
thing. And then there's just the loyalties, a bond

08:27.797 --> 08:32.944
between guys on the campus. What builds that bond? 
What creates it? Love, I think. The guys have

08:36.148 --> 08:37.950
learned to love each other. And I had a friend, a boy 
I loved with all my might and main. He was 10 years my

08:43.838 --> 08:46.942
junior. But He and I got along pretty good. And his 
family lived out here in a little town called

08:50.528 --> 08:55.213
Snook. And it was too far for me to go home every 
weekend, so he'd take me home with him. And I got to

09:02.160 --> 09:03.201
know his family. His family's similar to mine. My 
family's seven girls and four boys. And they had

09:09.928 --> 09:12.771
six girls and five boys. And I just fit it in out 
there. He died about six months ago. He had

09:19.912 --> 09:20.873
emphysema. He quit smoking, they said. He lived 
down close to Houston. I didn't see him anymore.

09:29.322 --> 09:34.166
His sister-in-law told me that he got emphysema, 
but she said it was too late. If you get emphysema,

09:36.028 --> 09:37.950
don't go away. He was on oxygen and everything, and 
his first wife, And I and he were like brother and

09:45.644 --> 09:50.574
sister. They were younger than I, but we just had a 
rapport. But she died with cancer too, so. then he

09:58.199 --> 10:00.242
got married again. It's just a girl that's 21 years 
younger than him. And they wouldn't, his

10:04.789 --> 10:13.162
sister-in-law, who might have been a little 
prejudiced, said she wouldn't let him see any of

10:04.789 --> 10:13.162
his family or nothing. She wanted him just for 
herself. When you were in the Air Force, what had

10:16.667 --> 10:25.320
you learned here as an Aggie that, proved to be 
important while you were on active duty? Well,

10:29.286 --> 10:35.075
being discreet, maybe. You know, you learn things 
at A&M, you know, about loyalty and that sort of

10:36.116 --> 10:42.366
thing that you carry over to military. And I was 
real happy with my military years. Did you, was it

10:49.236 --> 10:51.499
good to be an Aggie? Did sometimes that help you? We 
had Aggie meetings in in London, you know, on those

10:55.135 --> 11:01.802
days when they had these things, you know, the 
aprils. Y'all had a muster? Yeah. Really? There

11:04.144 --> 11:05.145
wasn't very many of us. There was five or six of us 
there, but they had a muster in London. Very good. I

11:10.831 --> 11:16.497
got permission from my captain, you know, the 
commander, to attend it. Did you attend muster

11:17.398 --> 11:20.101
when you came back from the war? Yes, I did. 
Occasionally. I didn't make all of them, you know,

11:22.363 --> 11:24.265
but I tried to be among those present. It's hard to 
get a place to stand when you try to go to muster

11:28.249 --> 11:33.235
here. And then sometimes you forget or something. 
I don't make them regularly. One of the questions I

11:39.843 --> 11:44.248
thought of, I forgot to ask you a while ago about the 
Aggieland Orchestra. Did you all have an opening

11:45.449 --> 11:48.773
and a closing theme song? The Aggieland 
Orchestra? Oh, I don't believe so. I don't

11:54.759 --> 11:55.300
remember. We might have had a Good Night song. What 
was it? Do you know? Well, let's see. Good night, my

12:01.086 --> 12:02.167
love. The tired old moon is descending. I believe 
that was the one we used all the time. There was

12:08.795 --> 12:13.079
another one that was similar to it, but I don't 
recall that we ever used that one. What did you all

12:13.100 --> 12:14.821
open with? Just maybe something jazzy. Get 
everybody in the mood. And how often did you

12:18.826 --> 12:21.589
introduce a new song? Well, not too often. We had a 
really big library. And we had most of those songs

12:28.019 --> 12:34.166
that were popular in that era. And so we just pretty 
much stayed with that thing. And you said you all

12:38.151 --> 12:40.614
practiced about once a week. Where did you 
practice? In Spica. That's where the piano was.

12:46.021 --> 12:49.185
Oh.

12:49.205 --> 12:49.565
Something. Was that Mother's? We're getting near 
the end. As you were getting ready to graduate, how

12:57.734 --> 13:06.523
well prepared did you think A&M had made you for the 
real world? Well, I thought I always wanted a

13:08.505 --> 13:12.048
college degree. And when I was graduating from 
high school, I went over to Denton. I thought maybe

13:18.094 --> 13:22.018
I could get a job over there as a musician. But that 
school was not big enough to have very many bands or

13:22.657 --> 13:29.444
anything there, and the one that they had was 
already filled. So I didn't meet with any success,

13:30.325 --> 13:40.935
but that didn't light my desire for a higher 
education, and particularly one at A&M. I had met

13:41.856 --> 13:50.825
A&M's junior, not junior, freshman baseball 
team. They came to McKinney and played the line.

13:53.133 --> 14:00.483
And I got acquainted with all of them, as a matter of 
fact, but a particular one of them, a freshman. And

14:00.503 --> 14:04.729
he encouraged me to go to A&M. He strengthened my 
desire to go to A&M. And I had always wanted to. And

14:10.176 --> 14:18.347
when I had a chance to come to A&M, I cast aside a lot 
of things that would keep me from going to A&M. And I

14:19.610 --> 14:25.117
came down here, like I told Murray, when he said, I 
don't know whether you ought to come down here or

14:19.610 --> 14:25.117
not. I said, well, I'm here and I'm going to stay. 
What are the key ingredients of an Aggie? Well,

14:35.790 --> 14:44.841
most of them are mentally and spiritually mature, 
you know. And I haven't met I'm not going to say how

14:50.187 --> 14:55.152
many Aggies that I didn't approve of, you know. 
Most of them, even now, I'll meet somebody I've

14:55.753 --> 14:59.277
never seen before. He said, Aggie, and he means 
you've got a rapport with them, you know. I don't

15:02.461 --> 15:03.642
know what it is. As long as there was no girls here 
and just a corps, you know, you got allied with your

15:05.924 --> 15:18.338
roommate and all the group, and you were in an 
organization You had to be in an organization. I

15:21.915 --> 15:22.476
don't know. There's just something about 
nagging. You meet a guy that's a nagging, and

15:24.259 --> 15:29.328
immediately you line up with him, you know. And I'm 
just happy that I had that chance to come to A&M.

15:36.821 --> 15:40.507
When you were a student, did you ever help gather up 
the stuff for Bonfire? No, I didn't. I was

15:44.963 --> 15:47.326
particularly done by the Corps members. And it was 
a really unfortunate thing that they had there in

15:48.327 --> 15:51.651
November. Oh, yes, yes. Now, I understand before 
the war that usually it was just trash. Yes,

15:57.399 --> 16:00.342
mostly, you know, it was picked up somewhere. I 
think they might have had a source of buying, or not

16:00.382 --> 16:08.072
buying, but clearing land, you know, and using the 
logs. But it was not anything like it developed

16:08.092 --> 16:13.519
into, not 55 feet high. Let's see. What feelings do 
you hold in your heart for Texas A&M today? All of

16:22.822 --> 16:23.202
these. And I never get over that love for A&M, you 
know. And as a matter of fact, after I finally got

16:29.468 --> 16:39.758
out of that graduation thing, I started to work out 
of A&M. I knew the guy that kept doors at the

16:43.030 --> 16:49.480
football games, and I knew that the other ones were 
basketball games. And for years I worked with

16:49.540 --> 16:53.286
those things, maybe six or seven years. I went out 
as a gatekeeper, baseball even one time, but they

16:54.167 --> 17:03.402
didn't pay enough to keep me involved in it. But I 
was a gatekeeper at all three of those games, type

17:03.782 --> 17:10.793
games, football, basketball, and baseball. Do 
you remember your graduation? Well, as a matter of

17:14.780 --> 17:16.883
fact, we didn't have any ceremonies. They paged, 
some of the authorities paged the 286 of us there,

17:17.564 --> 17:28.178
however many of them were seniors, to see whether 
or not we wanted a graduation ceremony. Well, in

17:29.120 --> 17:33.346
the first place, it was a small corps of people, 
men. In the second place, most of us were on up in

17:34.147 --> 17:41.657
years, and probably our families lived miles and 
miles away It would be an inconvenience to bring

17:42.059 --> 17:45.624
them down for a graduation ceremony. So they paged 
us to see how many of us wanted a graduation

17:45.644 --> 17:50.892
ceremony. And marginally, none of us didn't want 
to go through it. So we didn't have a graduation

17:57.743 --> 17:59.946
ceremony.

18:02.710 --> 18:03.331
What was that? 47.

18:08.030 --> 18:15.282
If you were trying to summarize your gratitude to 
Texas A&M today, how would you express that? Well,

18:16.864 --> 18:21.712
it'd be kind of hard to do, you know. I support the 
student thing, you know, the ex-student thing.

18:30.486 --> 18:32.529
Maybe that's one way that I do it. Sometimes I don't 
stand in a hundred bucks or whatever, you know, it

18:35.182 --> 18:40.247
is, but I think it's a very good organization. And 
it's just an awful lot about A&M that you, it's

18:41.488 --> 18:49.776
under the skin, but you don't know how to put 
fingers on it. Of course, I live off the campus

18:49.796 --> 18:51.578
right here. And I, in my condition, I rarely ever 
get out on the campus. I have worked, like I said,

18:57.924 --> 19:00.987
with the organizations the athletic association 
thing i've known a lot of this the athletes and and

19:02.384 --> 19:27.598
the wally groff and you know that his staff i don't 
know and once in a while they'll prior to the

19:02.384 --> 19:27.598
football season they'll have the coaches out 
there you know everybody goes and meets the

19:02.384 --> 19:27.598
students and the new athletes and all that sort of 
thing. And I like that kind of deal. It kind of ties

19:32.531 --> 19:35.634
you to the... I no longer work the gates anymore, 
but Cargill does. And he's got a thousand friends

19:39.738 --> 19:41.980
out there. And this one family comes, they've been 
there all the years when I worked there. The man and

19:50.508 --> 19:53.791
his wife, they had two daughters and a son. And they 
still come in at that gate. And they always ask

19:59.135 --> 20:00.857
about me. And you learn to know a lot of people, you 
know, on that thing. They'll be there this year and

20:07.002 --> 20:10.306
next year until they die. And it's nice to know that 
you've made that kind of friends. And they're

20:14.550 --> 20:15.691
Aggies. And there's just a loyalty there and a 
relationship that's, you know, you don't expect

20:16.992 --> 20:25.820
that kind of thing from people outside. And even 
your church, you know. It's just there. Who can

20:30.506 --> 20:33.441
explain it? Let's quit with that. That's a 
splendid ending.
