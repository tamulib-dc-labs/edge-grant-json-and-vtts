WEBVTT

00:01.364 --> 00:05.668
Once we were paid, it's working at the mess hall, 
but we got our food.

00:11.314 --> 00:13.056
You didn't get all your food, though. You got thank 
yous. That's where I remember we got our food. And

00:16.359 --> 00:17.940
that was a big item. Oh, sure. That was a big item. 
And the sacrifice that my family could make and did

00:21.624 --> 00:26.369
make, why? Did they help out? Oh, yes, they helped 
out. Did your father help out? helped out and was a

00:31.081 --> 00:38.830
great inspiration to me, because I knew they were 
sacrificing to keep my brother in the law school.

00:39.751 --> 00:41.813
And I was able to find work, and he wasn't. So it 
didn't bother me a bit in the world. I wanted to do

00:44.697 --> 00:45.538
it. And as I remember, I kept books on it. It cost me 
about $1,600 to go through A&M for four years. And

00:57.311 --> 00:58.793
I'm sure they contributed. half a little more of 
it, and I made the rest. What

01:02.357 --> 01:07.781
did you think of the living conditions then? Of 
living conditions?

01:12.265 --> 01:19.151
Well, of course, I

01:12.265 --> 01:19.151
ate it up. I liked it. I could see where I was going. I 
thought I could see where I was going. And I kept

01:25.837 --> 01:29.860
busy. I

01:31.325 --> 01:50.064
went out to play basketball and my size and all I 
thought would be a help, but it conflicted with my

01:31.325 --> 01:50.064
work, studies, no question about it. I let it 
conflict with my work, let's say it that way.

01:55.370 --> 02:00.555
Whether it necessarily would or should or not, 
then I was taking a full course It conflicted with

02:01.733 --> 02:17.695
my work,

02:01.733 --> 02:17.695
and

02:01.733 --> 02:17.695
I was getting along in basketball, let's just say 
it that way. And one time we got our grades and I

02:19.618 --> 02:27.989
wasn't doing so well, and I got a letter, a note from 
Dean Bolton. He wanted to talk to me. So I went over

02:30.202 --> 02:32.224
and talked to Dean Baldwin. He was head of the 
engineering department at that time. Great old

02:38.812 --> 02:44.579
gentleman, great teacher, and a great 
philosopher, in my opinion. He knew how to handle

02:45.841 --> 02:48.544
kids, boys. He sat me down. He talked to me for a long 
time about, asked me the same kind of questions,

02:50.907 --> 02:59.297
why I came to A&M and what I wanted out of A&M, this 
kind of thing. And I told him. And he said, well,

03:05.267 --> 03:11.876
now, did you finally ask me the question, did you 
come down here to play basketball or did you come

03:05.267 --> 03:11.876
down here to get an education? Now, Kibble, I don't 
want you to make up your mind right now. I want you to

03:16.002 --> 03:20.148
go think about this and come back and tell me in two 
or three days. And so I did. And I went back and told

03:22.932 --> 03:28.120
him that I came down And he said, well, I'm so glad 
you made up your mind. Now get about it. Anyway, I

03:33.808 --> 03:34.869
can help you a while. Let me know. Otherwise, get 
about it. Just start studying. So I started

03:38.294 --> 03:39.556
studying. And my junior year, I liked one great 
point of being qualified, you know, as

03:39.576 --> 03:51.053
outstanding student. They called it 
qualification those days. And my senior year, I

03:54.778 --> 03:58.123
mean, they called it distinction, distinguished 
student. And my senior year I had, as I remember, 17

04:01.987 --> 04:11.779
grade points more than necessary to be a 
distinguished student. My senior year I got all

04:11.799 --> 04:13.020
As. That's fantastic. Fantastic. My junior year I 
got all As but one or two. After the good dean

04:20.109 --> 04:27.317
convinced me that that the education was there, 
and if you came down to get it, get after your boy.

04:32.928 --> 04:33.770
And if you didn't, why? I don't know what he had done 
if I had gone back and told him I wanted to play

04:34.891 --> 04:37.574
basketball. He probably told me that the train 
leaves at 4.30 next afternoon and be on it. But that

04:43.021 --> 04:50.171
didn't happen, and so I went ahead and graduated as 
a distinguished student in 1932.

04:53.595 --> 04:57.540
I just took- Must have been awfully hard to get a 
job. It was extremely hard to get a job. And I was the

05:00.320 --> 05:09.829
first one in our class of structural engineers, 
what I took.

05:09.849 --> 05:15.195
I'm a registered civil engineer, but I took 
structural engineering then and then. Because I

05:15.215 --> 05:17.096
wanted to get into construction. I didn't want to 
be a consultant engineer. As such, I wanted to be

05:21.661 --> 05:24.404
out here under the building. And being a builder, 
and so I took structural engineering. thinking

05:28.570 --> 05:35.776
that that would better qualify me for the big 
picture of what I was trying to do.

05:39.640 --> 05:47.927
And I believe there were eight or nine, eight of us 
in that class, in that group.

05:47.947 --> 05:51.770
And I was the first one who got a job for seven 
months.

05:54.833 --> 05:57.075
I got a job working for Mr. P.O.B. Montgomery, who 
was a Dallas building contractor

05:59.082 --> 06:07.913
who built the University of Texas. I mean, that's 
where I went to work for him, down at the University

06:08.173 --> 06:17.885
of Texas building, the library, the present 
library, the present physics, and the present

06:08.173 --> 06:17.885
union building down there. Those three buildings 
were in one contract, $1,750,000. Were they

06:23.191 --> 06:27.096
federal funds? I have no idea. University of Texas 
funds, I presume. Because they didn't have all

06:32.944 --> 06:35.047
that federal business then. Oh, in 1932 they, oh, 
well in 1933 they did. They started in 33 and 34, but

06:39.272 --> 06:41.815
true. I don't know. I wasn't interested in where 
the money's come from. I was interested in the job,

06:46.440 --> 06:51.967
and I got a job down there as a laborer for 25 cents an 
hour. I was a beautiful draftsman in those days,

06:54.050 --> 06:56.813
and I kind of worked as a

06:58.177 --> 07:09.993
apprentice engineer in the office, the 
superintendent's office. Those buildings were

07:11.676 --> 07:14.640
structural steel jobs. And the structural steel 
would come out not fabricated exactly like the

07:15.601 --> 07:22.891
plans showed. In other words, the rivet holes 
wouldn't line up. and we might have to send a piece

07:26.594 --> 07:35.747
back to be either rebuilt or re-bored or 
something. And I would do that job detailing on the

07:36.608 --> 07:45.321
job and send it back steel fabricated.

07:45.341 --> 07:48.425
This was a kind of roustabout crew that I was in. 
There were 10 of us, all civil engineers. Now that I

07:55.568 --> 07:57.691
was making $0.25 an hour. And Tethland had a 
master's of civil engineering. He made $0.30 an

08:01.276 --> 08:03.920
hour. So he was a crew chief.

08:09.188 --> 08:17.019
And he was in the contracting business here for a 
long time, building contracting business here

08:09.188 --> 08:17.019
for a long time in Dallas.

08:22.347 --> 08:25.491
We did roustabout work around the jobs.

08:27.648 --> 08:43.544
measuring dirt, setting grades, checking 
material coming in,

08:27.648 --> 08:43.544
running errands for the superintendent, this 
kind of thing. I used to go with him and watch him

08:44.925 --> 08:52.293
check the rivets to be sure they were tight rivets. 
That's where I learned to know whether a rivet's

08:53.214 --> 08:57.638
tight or not and whether it's got to come out or not. 
That's when I

08:58.715 --> 09:17.253
learned it in sophomore CE summer training where 
they have that field course on measuring dirt and

08:58.715 --> 09:17.253
running lines and grades and all. But that's the 
first time I ever applied it was down there

09:17.733 --> 09:26.241
measuring dirt in excavations.

09:27.267 --> 09:35.938
measuring field dirt and measuring

09:27.267 --> 09:35.938
crushed rock and this kind of thing. We mixed all 
our own concrete on that job and we unloaded rock

09:35.958 --> 09:44.709
out of a gondola car with a number 10 scoop. When we 
weren't doing some of this engineering, I was out

09:45.490 --> 09:55.823
there in a gondola car unloading crushed rock for 
two bits an hour.

09:58.030 --> 09:59.712
But it's all relative. It's a good job. Like I say, I 
was the first one out of our group of eight

10:03.818 --> 10:10.908
structural engineers that got a job. And I was 
thankful for it. Every day I went through four,

10:12.811 --> 10:18.519
five, 600 people, men wanting jobs. And believe 
you me, if you got a job, you go through that kind of a

10:26.380 --> 10:31.569
environment getting to your job, it'll make you 
dig a better ditch faster and cleaner. And it did me

10:32.750 --> 10:35.255
that. Now let's go back for a minute here at the 
Corps. Did you have a position of leadership in the

10:38.460 --> 10:41.445
Corps? At A&M? No. No. I was qualified, but I did not 
have a position of leadership in the A&M Corps.

10:53.752 --> 10:59.638
What were some of the things that you liked and what 
were some of the things that you disliked about

10:53.752 --> 10:59.638
being in the Corps? I liked every moment of it, and I 
didn't dislike one moment of it. There wasn't

11:04.483 --> 11:05.765
anything at all? I'm convinced that it made a man 
out of me. Oh, fine. OK. So let's talk about in what

11:10.710 --> 11:14.014
ways then the Corps helped you. What do you mean it 
made a man out of you? It made a man out of me in that I

11:15.836 --> 11:22.763
learned

11:15.836 --> 11:22.763
to take discipline. After my early training, I 
learned, I mean my parental training, I learned to

11:24.548 --> 11:33.418
take discipline from strangers.

11:35.601 --> 11:43.710
And I learned to respect authority,

11:35.601 --> 11:43.710
meaning a corporal tell me something to do, and I'd 
do it. A lieutenant tell me something to do, I'd do

11:45.252 --> 11:46.834
it.

11:50.558 --> 11:53.982
And I liked the routine. the demanding routine, 
and it was a demand of getting up and making your bed

11:54.620 --> 12:22.787
up, cleaning it up, cleaning yourself up, going 
down and answering a revelry call, and cleaning up

11:54.620 --> 12:22.787
your sophomore, your junior, your senior's 
rooms, and marching to breakfast, going to the

11:54.620 --> 12:22.787
classroom, marching to lunch, going to the 
classroom, marching, going to information for a

11:54.620 --> 12:22.787
retreat every night. So you like the 
regimentation? Well,

12:26.753 --> 12:32.762
I guess that's the way to put it. I like the routine. 
Yeah, the routine, okay. If that's

12:38.450 --> 12:41.074
regimentation, well I like regimentation.

12:44.939 --> 12:48.324
I enjoyed the fellowships.

12:49.205 --> 12:50.647
Yeah, I would think so. Of your colleagues? The 
greatest friends I have were made at A&M. And we'd

12:56.388 --> 12:59.132
be lifelong friends. Why do you think that is? Why 
do you think? I've talked to many generals, and

13:01.776 --> 13:04.099
they said the same thing. The greatest friends I 
met, I started our friendship at A&M. Why do you

13:11.208 --> 13:12.791
think that is? Going through the core from the time 
I got off of that train early at 4 o'clock, 4.30 the

13:20.598 --> 13:47.885
first morning I was there and going up there and 
associating myself with two or three friends and

13:20.598 --> 13:47.885
then some strangers and becoming part of the group 
and going through the fellowship of the hazing and

13:20.598 --> 13:47.885
that was real fellowship in the final analysis. It 
was me qualifying to participate in being one of

13:51.243 --> 14:02.920
the fellows, being

13:51.243 --> 14:02.920
a good fish, if that's a good way to put it. And by 
being a good fish, I established myself as being a

14:02.940 --> 14:09.509
good friend. And

14:11.412 --> 14:19.163
all the way up the line, the core, I like to drill. I 
like to work with the horses. And I liked the

14:21.517 --> 14:37.352
competition that we got, and the horsemanship, 
and then the qualifications in the military sense

14:21.517 --> 14:37.352
of meaning, the gunner's qualification, and the 
number one qualification, and all those jobs.

14:40.235 --> 14:50.545
I accomplished all of them, and to me it was very 
basic training. The friendships that I made with

14:52.094 --> 15:05.212
A&M are indelibly imprinted in my mind and I could, 
I dare say I could go to any one of them today and ask

14:52.094 --> 15:05.212
them for the shirt off the back and they'd give it to 
me and vice versa.

15:09.137 --> 15:10.639
The esprit de corps idea. Esprit de corps was the 
outstanding thing that you leave A&M with.

15:21.980 --> 15:24.824
Equally so with a good education. This is the thing 
that distinguishes A&M against University of

15:26.846 --> 15:32.433
Texas engineering students, for instance. Okay, 
let's talk about that now. This is the thing. I was

15:35.417 --> 15:44.609
convinced if I wanted to be an engineer, I should go 
to A&M to be an engineer because I wanted to stay in

15:35.417 --> 15:44.609
Texas. If you want to be a lawyer, you ought to go to 
University of Texas because University of Texas

15:45.930 --> 15:51.177
lawyers run our law business in this state. If you 
want to be a doctor, you ought to go to Baylor or the

15:56.025 --> 16:00.691
University of Texas Medical School. If you want to 
be an engineer, you ought to go to A&M. And their

16:06.999 --> 16:22.378
ex-students

16:06.999 --> 16:22.378
or their

16:06.999 --> 16:22.378
status, if that's the way to put it, has been long 
since established

16:23.118 --> 16:36.777
as a potential leader in the engineering world. 
There are more engineers and leaders jobs today,

16:38.900 --> 16:51.498
A&M engineers, than any other school in this part 
of the country. And my cousin convinced me of that

16:53.341 --> 17:00.010
back in those days when I was formulating and 
convincing myself, confirming my convictions,

16:53.341 --> 17:00.010
that that's where I wanted to go to school. And I 
don't regret one moment of it.

17:09.383 --> 17:22.842
I think the

17:09.383 --> 17:22.842
basic understanding and fellowship of any A&M 
graduate is well worth all the trials and

17:09.383 --> 17:22.842
tribulations of going down there in those days in 
the Corps and coming out of it. Now, you became a

17:27.425 --> 17:29.828
general, which is a leader. How did A&M or the Corps 
affect that? Did it help you in some way become a

17:38.237 --> 17:40.059
leader? Well, I'm sure it helped me in my 
analytical mind. It helped me in the discipline of

17:45.144 --> 17:49.689
myself. It helped me to be able to lead men.

18:00.955 --> 18:05.279
As a general officer, you have to be two things. You 
have to be a leader and you have to be a capable

18:05.299 --> 18:08.762
administrator.

18:11.185 --> 18:13.206
And A&M taught me both.

18:16.189 --> 18:22.495
I

18:16.189 --> 18:22.495
can't get away from the indelible lessons that 
that I got at A&M that I've used all the rest of my

18:23.656 --> 18:27.860
adult life.

18:32.125 --> 18:34.607
Those things stay with you, become a part of you. 
And to me, that's what A&M's all about. Now, let's

18:39.473 --> 18:51.705
for a second here compare, for a minute, compare 
the officers of A&M with officers of our other

18:39.473 --> 18:51.705
so-called ROTC schools. Would you compare those? 
Well, yes, I certainly compared them with West

18:54.402 --> 18:56.945
Point. And I've compared them with Oklahoma 
University, who had an artillery unit up there,

18:57.926 --> 19:08.159
OTC. I've compared them with Purdue. They had an 
ROTC unit, artillery unit there. I've compared

19:13.185 --> 19:16.630
with Alabama. They had an artillery unit there. I 
think those were the three. artillery units, and

19:23.967 --> 19:33.938
because I was so closely associated with the 
artillery, I couldn't help but be associated with

19:23.967 --> 19:33.938
those schools. Sure.

19:39.604 --> 19:53.198
Invariably, we tried to, I as an officer, and I'm 
sure all A&M officers tried to excel West Poners,

19:39.604 --> 19:53.198
because I

19:54.292 --> 20:13.552
think if we could do it, we did do it, in that that was 
their job, and to me, my Army career was an

19:54.292 --> 20:13.552
extracurriculum activity.

20:16.675 --> 20:23.522
When the Gauntlets were down, and the

20:30.590 --> 20:50.332
very,

20:30.590 --> 20:50.332
life as I know it in our country was at stakes,

20:30.590 --> 20:50.332
meaning the safety of our country or the defense of 
our country was at stakes. I was a true

20:52.355 --> 20:59.803
dyed-in-the-wool army officer and every every 
every day was a challenge to me to excel and I did. I

21:05.721 --> 21:28.592
excelled in

21:05.721 --> 21:28.592
showing up many West Pointers that they would have 
corresponding commands of mine and it was it was a

21:05.721 --> 21:28.592
real really it was a sometimes a detriment because 
a senior What was the detriment? My desire to be, to

21:32.902 --> 21:35.786
excel. Oh, okay. Because some very senior 
officers, meaning two and three and four-star

21:38.790 --> 21:48.004
generals, would hold me up as an example to West 
Pointers. And that didn't help our relations at

21:49.386 --> 21:53.092
all. No, I wouldn't think so. I mean our admiration 
for one another at all. I did it because I was going

21:58.087 --> 22:08.682
to excel irrespective of where I'd gone to 
college, and they were out there doing their daily

21:58.087 --> 22:08.682
work. It was all a chore to them, and to me it was a 
challenge. And so I saw it every day. Nothing in the

22:17.254 --> 22:25.545
world gave me more pleasure than winning a 
competition over one of them. and my artillery

22:26.555 --> 22:28.718
units did. We won lots of competitions over them, 
and consistently got better ratings, and then one

22:29.719 --> 22:46.180
or two out of the four that we were associated with, 
you know, just free decor of the artillery.

22:49.243 --> 22:54.570
Well, could you compare the officers of those 
institutions you talked about with the A&M

22:49.243 --> 22:54.570
officers? The best way to compare them is to tell 
you the admiration that the very senior

22:55.327 --> 23:11.391
regular army officers held for the A&M Cardiff 
Blind, an A&M ROTC officer. Invariably, they were

23:13.054 --> 23:24.591
given the responsibility above any other school, 
because the senior officers knew that the A&M

23:13.054 --> 23:24.591
officers were Carry the ball, get the job done, 
period. No question about it. As versus some of the

23:31.905 --> 23:33.127
others. A&M had a better basic training, I think. 
They came out of A&M better equipped to do a better

23:37.894 --> 23:44.264
job. And this is not the fault of Oklahoma 
University or Purdue or Alabama or any of the rest

23:45.826 --> 23:53.177
of them. It's the excellence of Texas A&M.

23:59.278 --> 24:01.881
Well, what about West Point? Well, I

24:01.901 --> 24:11.272
don't know. They don't teach the

24:11.433 --> 24:18.321
same thing as A&M teaches. They don't 
indoctrinate their people at A&M, taught in those

24:19.465 --> 24:22.989
days. That's what I'm talking about. And I'm sure 
it's just, it's much better today. Because A&M,

24:29.517 --> 24:38.267
you know, in those days was the outstanding 
college in our world. And I'm sure they had

24:39.949 --> 24:49.000
problems that we got reflections of, but didn't 
know the the details or weren't concerned with,

24:49.722 --> 24:54.068
let's say it that way. But in later life, I got into a 
lot of those problems. John Rutter was a very close

25:03.181 --> 25:05.364
friend of mine. We were classmates. And he and I 
were very close friends, as close as I guess he was

25:06.646 --> 25:17.080
to anybody. And he would discuss his problems 
there with me. Maybe as a trial balloon, I finally

25:24.624 --> 25:30.352
got convinced that that's what he was doing, is 
getting my opinion. I'm sure he talked to a lot of

25:30.493 --> 25:33.257
people that same way. But I can see that a lot of my 
recommendations were adopted that way, too. And

25:41.109 --> 25:46.257
so I know he had problems just like everybody else 
does.

25:52.598 --> 26:15.627
I credit the A&M Corps training to have qualified 
me and given me the desire and equipped me to do

25:52.598 --> 26:15.627
things I did in the Army, which were

25:52.598 --> 26:15.627
excelled. OK, what about, let's move away from the 
Corps and the military aspect of A&M. and move on to

26:21.472 --> 26:22.893
the academic. You gave a little example of how you 
were prompted, we might say, to do better. What did

26:31.222 --> 26:39.951
you think of the professors, the quality of the 
professors, back in the early 1930s at A&M? Well,

26:41.493 --> 26:50.382
I would never criticize any of them, although I had 
some very definite thoughts about them. For

26:53.478 --> 27:10.901
instance, perhaps some of them were too old or too, 
I remember a very kind gentleman named, we

26:53.478 --> 27:10.901
nicknamed him, his name was Robert something 
Smith, and we called him Bobby Smith, taught

26:53.478 --> 27:10.901
calculus. And I busted calculus. Busted it the 
first time I took it because I didn't apply myself.

27:17.790 --> 27:19.272
Nothing to worry about. But anyway, I took it under 
him a second time and passed it. But he didn't teach

27:24.118 --> 27:36.214
me the calculus that I think some of the others 
could have taught me, purely and simply because he

27:24.118 --> 27:36.214
was too old to teach. I don't know his status. I 
don't know his rank or anything about that. But he

27:42.222 --> 27:43.244
would come in. It was so methodical with him. He'd 
come in and, gentlemen, the lesson today was on

27:49.964 --> 27:54.531
page 22, 23, and down to paragraph 2 on 24. He would 
start out with a problem and go right on across the

27:55.192 --> 28:02.865
board, never talk, never get out of a monotone, 
explaining the problems. If there were three,

28:03.806 --> 28:08.514
he'd go around the board three times, and that's 
the end of the class.

28:12.239 --> 28:17.608
That wasn't the kind of teaching that probably 
would have gotten the points over to me. versus a

28:19.512 --> 28:28.300
teacher that would have been asking Kidwell and 
Jones and Smith and Babcock questions and kept us

28:19.512 --> 28:28.300
on our toes.

28:32.164 --> 28:42.073
Some of the other instructors were outstanding, 
and I still remember their instruction over in the

28:32.164 --> 28:42.073
CE department. Doc Grinter taught me structures, 
and he was outstanding. Grinter? Grinter. How do

28:50.090 --> 28:50.771
you spell that? I believe it's 
G-R-U-E-N-T-H-E-R, Grinter. I'll look him up.

29:00.164 --> 29:05.111
And another one, Sleepy Joe Stansted, Dr. 
Stansted. I think he later headed the CE

29:06.212 --> 29:10.939
department. I'll look him up, too. He would come 
in, and he would give us a test every week.

29:28.257 --> 29:35.106
And if you passed all those tests, or you passed his 
required number of those tests, you didn't have to

29:28.257 --> 29:35.106
take final exams. And so you cram by the week, 
instead of cramming by the end of three and a half

29:37.108 --> 29:47.080
months, or four months, whenever it was. I liked 
that method of teaching. It got

29:51.580 --> 29:59.388
my lessons over to me better, let's say it that way, 
and that's what I have to judge it by. I wouldn't

30:01.790 --> 30:10.179
criticize any of the instructors because

30:01.790 --> 30:10.179
I got an education. Maybe I could have gotten a 
finer one by more sleepy Joe Sandstead than more

30:17.080 --> 30:22.127
Dr. Grenners than I could fewer Dr. Bobby Smiths. 
What about your colleagues as far as students,

30:23.108 --> 30:28.415
other corpsmen as far as students? Were they good, 
bad, indifferent? Did they help you or didn't that

30:31.058 --> 30:36.626
have much of an impact? Did you think it was more 
individual? It was more individual help.

30:46.409 --> 30:56.926
The juniors in B Battery rode hard over you being at 
your desk from call to quarters, which I think was

30:46.409 --> 30:56.926
7.30 to 9.45. And you had a book in your hand, and 
you'd be looking at that book. They came around and

31:01.613 --> 31:08.164
checked, theoretically, making sure that you 
were studying.

31:08.752 --> 31:14.017
We couldn't be in our room playing dominoes or 
cards or watching, listening to radio. They

31:14.057 --> 31:16.859
didn't have TV in those days, but listening to 
radio. Or having a bull session. You had to be

31:19.402 --> 31:20.183
studying. The juniors ran. That was their 
delegated responsibility as far as the company

31:23.466 --> 31:27.349
commander was concerned. Because the company 
commander was judged based, among other things,

31:27.369 --> 31:35.977
on the academic standing of all of his company. 
Sure. Absolutely. That was his method or their

31:38.654 --> 31:56.278
methods of making you study doing what was called a 
call to quarters, which was a study period from

31:38.654 --> 31:56.278
7.30 or 7.15, something like that, till 9.45.

31:57.740 --> 32:07.193
If I wanted to go to another hall, say I wanted to go 
over to Bazell and study with one of the men in my

31:57.740 --> 32:07.193
class on a problem that we had were having, I had to 
go get permission to be out of my room. From Mr.

32:13.519 --> 32:14.981
Junior, it was checking that night. Go to the first 
sergeant, he'd tell you, well, Sergeant Smith's

32:15.882 --> 32:31.325
checking tonight, or Sergeant Jones, or Sergeant 
somebody, and you'll tell him, if they thought you

32:15.882 --> 32:31.325
were sloughing off on them, they'd check up. And if 
you didn't go to, Jones' room over in Bazell Hall,

32:37.126 --> 32:43.855
and they caught you at it, you got ten licks with the 
board. That's all it was to it. And, you know, that

32:45.898 --> 32:49.843
took incentive out of goofing off real quick. 
Taught honesty. Taught honesty, that's right.

32:53.408 --> 33:05.525
Now, I've heard in a number of interviews that A&M 
is more than just a college or a university or just

32:53.408 --> 33:05.525
an institution, but it's something special or 
unique. What are your thoughts on that?

33:07.400 --> 33:09.723
Certainly, it's unique in its own right. But it's a 
spirit of the Corps that is indelibly impressed on

33:11.965 --> 33:28.705
your very life, or your philosophy of life, your

33:11.965 --> 33:28.705
attitude on life, your approach on people. Today, 
you go in and introduce yourself. You grab him with

33:32.109 --> 33:35.753
a hand, and you shake him with the same grasp that 
you don't get from ex-students in SMU or Texas

33:36.475 --> 33:43.422
University or anywhere else.

33:44.383 --> 33:45.705
You have the... I

33:47.346 --> 34:05.065
don't want to say forwardness, but you have the 
self-satisfaction and self... confidence

34:06.158 --> 34:13.525
of going on and saying, my name's Kidwell, and this 
is what I want to talk to you about. Or how's the

34:14.826 --> 34:22.433
weather, and how are you getting along on this job, 
and you got a problem, I got a problem, how will you

34:14.826 --> 34:22.433
solve it? With a full confidence of knowing that 
I'll be listened to and can work it out. Sure.

34:34.508 --> 34:36.530
Getting the job done. Getting the job done. I think 
that that self-confidence is as much a part of the

34:37.231 --> 34:45.981
things that taught me at A&M as anything.

34:52.307 --> 34:58.474
The good dean did that and taught me that I could 
excel academically. I'm sure that old Bull Nelson

34:58.494 --> 35:03.840
taught me that in our ROTC work. He was an old time 
infantry colonel and he was bull of the woods. When

35:12.368 --> 35:22.379
we were down there, I'll never forget the funniest 
thing, if you could ask me this I'll tell it now and I

35:12.368 --> 35:22.379
can repeat it, was the funniest thing that 
happened at A&M. Of course lots of funny things

35:22.399 --> 35:24.061
happen. But we were living in Milner Hall at that 
time and

35:37.891 --> 36:07.712
Some of the Hellraisers, if that's a good word, 
call it a good name for them, would get these

35:37.891 --> 36:07.712
railroad torpedoes, steal them from the SP when 
they go, when someone's on a train, and either put

35:37.891 --> 36:07.712
them between two bricks or put them on a piece of 
reinforced steel and drop them, point down or

35:37.891 --> 36:07.712
something, and they hit the concrete paving in 
the, I call it the wells, you know, the ventilation

35:37.891 --> 36:07.712
wells in Milner Hall. It's on a figure eight 
design, and these interior wells have got

36:08.215 --> 36:18.611
concrete in them, and they drop them off second, 
third, fourth floor, and she'd blow off like a

36:08.215 --> 36:18.611
shotgun. And they'd been dropping them for a month 
or something, like once a week or something, just

36:20.854 --> 36:30.649
to break monotony of so much studying. And they're 
getting ready to have a board of directors meeting

36:32.993 --> 36:36.298
down there. And the night before the board's meet 
the next day,

36:38.337 --> 37:01.190
Colonel Nelson came over, got a B battery out on the 
steps of Milner Hall, and he gave us a lecture on

36:38.337 --> 37:01.190
conduct while the board of directors was on the 
campus. And he came out with a statement any more of

37:05.708 --> 37:11.436
those goddamn torpedoes going off, I'll walk 
every one of you to Brazos. And he hadn't dismissed

37:13.398 --> 37:18.565
us two minutes before, whoom, whoom, whoom.

37:21.810 --> 37:35.648
And he came right back and he got our tactical 
officer, Captain Richards and Captain

37:21.810 --> 37:35.648
Richards, and Lieutenant

37:36.438 --> 37:52.463
Paul, I believe was his name, Lieutenant Paul, and 
Captain Harry, Tom Harry. And of course he said,

37:55.067 --> 38:04.842
now I told you, you're going to the Bradditch, so 
follow the battery out and walk to the Bradditch.

38:06.037 --> 38:09.582
And so they fell the B battery out, called a roll. 
The old Colonel Nelson was down there at the Brazos

38:09.602 --> 38:16.592
in his car when we got there, and he called a watch, 
called a roll. And believe you me, when he spoke

38:18.175 --> 38:22.561
from in on out, we reacted. But that was the first 
walk to the Brazos. But he hadn't got any more. No

38:30.232 --> 38:30.873
more of those. Colt got the words out of his mouth, 
the whoom, whoom.

38:37.998 --> 38:42.444
I mean, been in the Corps, you know. Sure, 
absolutely. Let's shift now, oh wait, before we

38:46.109 --> 39:00.708
shift to your military career, I should ask you if 
there's anything else about being at A&M or the

38:46.109 --> 39:00.708
Corps or academics or anything that you think we 
should discuss before we move on? Was there any

39:00.729 --> 39:05.575
really, real important or very significant? 
episode that happened that you'd like to discuss?

39:09.790 --> 39:10.111
No. That had an impact? No. I think the, of course, 
like I said, there's lots of funny things that

39:13.696 --> 39:21.348
happened, and you're not interested in funny 
things. I think that the thing that got out of the

39:22.249 --> 39:35.629
core more than anything else was the discipline, 
the training to discipline, and the

39:22.249 --> 39:35.629
self-confidence that I carried and the 
friendships that I made.

39:44.967 --> 39:50.092
How about preparation for your military and 
civilian career? Well, that's the discipline and

39:52.253 --> 39:54.976
all that you got. Basically, I realized that the 
Army wanted, when I got in December of 48, they

39:57.498 --> 40:07.287
wanted people that they could give a job and depend 
on to get the job done. They wanted somebody to

40:11.498 --> 40:13.080
carry the ball. And I had certainly learned that.

40:20.950 --> 40:28.720
I learned when very early, and I don't remember 
what it is, I'm sure it was at A&M, somebody tell me

40:20.950 --> 40:28.720
to do something. If I couldn't do it, I learned to go 
tell them I couldn't do it and why, and they said, on

40:36.764 --> 40:38.226
doing some other way. And maybe that's a good trait 
too, in that

40:40.529 --> 40:54.630
you recognize impossibilities. Of

40:54.830 --> 41:04.965
course, like somebody said one time, Harder 
things take a little while to do. And impossible,

41:08.953 --> 41:11.416
well, that takes a little longer. And sometimes 
you learn that and have to work at it harder. But

41:19.366 --> 41:23.091
that's what the Army looked for. And anybody that 
can give them that response can't help but go up in

41:25.054 --> 41:35.087
it. They give you the responsibility, they give 
you the tools to do your job, and if you do the job,

41:35.540 --> 41:42.610
you're recognized for it. And that was my whole 
experience in the Army. A&M gave me the basic

41:50.701 --> 42:04.720
foundation, and I stayed active in the Army, I mean 
in the Reserves,

41:50.701 --> 42:04.720
meaning going to two weeks summer active duty and 
going to, we called it troop schools in those days,

42:05.037 --> 42:34.099
going to once a night training during the week and 
doing correspondence work to keep up with Army

42:05.037 --> 42:34.099
changing

42:05.037 --> 42:34.099
tactical training and

42:37.201 --> 42:42.847
Here in Dallas, we had the 407th Field Artillery 
Group, a reserve group. And we went down every

42:43.988 --> 42:47.172
Thursday night. And that became just a part of my 
life of going to troop school on Thursday night, as

42:48.033 --> 42:57.403
Sunday morning Sunday school and church is. It's 
just something that I started doing when I was a

42:58.424 --> 43:06.212
bachelor and carried right into my married life.

43:08.167 --> 43:15.231
My wife knew that on Thursday night they have early 
dinner, so I'll go to troop school at 7 o'clock. And

43:15.251 --> 43:20.910
I got promoted to first lieutenant and then to 
captain. I was a captain when I was called in the

43:22.983 --> 43:25.206
Army in 1940. Yeah, well let's talk about your 
military career now. Let's talk about the early

43:29.511 --> 43:32.154
reserves. How did you become involved with the 
reserves? Of course, the United States Army

43:35.479 --> 43:42.227
wasn't too interested in active duty personnel 
during the Depression. How did you become

43:42.788 --> 43:48.535
involved with the reserves?

43:52.582 --> 44:00.673
I became involved with them in that they had these 
reserve units in the major cities. They had one in

44:00.753 --> 44:01.774
Dallas. And

44:02.776 --> 44:09.064
Dallas is where I started to work. And then I

44:09.945 --> 44:18.657
went to Austin, they had one there.

44:20.864 --> 44:41.502
I was interested in equipping myself with current 
Army training purely and simply to prepare myself

44:20.864 --> 44:41.502
in the eventuality of the

44:20.864 --> 44:41.502
defense of our country. They taught me that down at 
A&M. And certainly, when you got down in the

44:46.506 --> 44:49.909
reserves, that's what they preached to you. about 
patriotic preparedness promotes peace. And the

44:57.298 --> 45:07.507
best defense is preparedness. They taught that 
then and they haven't changed the philosophy one

45:07.768 --> 45:11.331
older today. I'm convinced that that's correct 
and I've proved it out

45:20.382 --> 45:21.463
Army career.

45:24.747 --> 45:32.877
So you want to stay up, the reason why you became 
involved with the reserves is that you wanted to

45:24.747 --> 45:32.877
stay up on new artillery methods. On new artillery 
methods and in doctrine so that if there was ever an

45:32.997 --> 45:43.370
occasion I would be qualified. Okay. When did you 
join your first reserve unit?

45:51.297 --> 45:54.462
In May or June of 1932 when I got my commission. 
Okay. When I graduated day and in. Okay, okay. And

45:59.110 --> 46:01.614
can you tell us about the conditions? And let me 
flip back through here and I'll give you the exact

46:01.634 --> 46:05.180
date. These are chronologically in order now. And 
I should have the appointing

46:10.048 --> 46:17.220
authority.

46:19.883 --> 46:22.046
You were commissioned the 28th of May, 1932. 
Here's my commission right here. Yeah, that's

46:24.430 --> 46:26.433
correct. As 2nd Lieutenant Field Artillery. 
Yeah. In May 28, 1932.

46:45.642 --> 46:47.545
And the way that thing worked... I went to these 
training schools, and when I finished my

46:48.402 --> 47:05.142
correspondence courses, they gave you a 
certificate of capacity as having qualified

46:48.402 --> 47:05.142
yourself for the promotion of the next grade.

47:12.371 --> 47:15.675
And here's coming out of where they give you that 
certificate and tell you that you're qualified

47:17.191 --> 47:21.801
for the next promotion.
