WEBVTT

00:05.279 --> 00:13.231
and the walls were hard stucco.

00:13.251 --> 00:18.278
In each room we had a laboratory where we could 
brush our teeth and shave. One laboratory. There

00:21.323 --> 00:34.282
were two closets, one on either side of the room in 
those buildings, so that each room, each person in

00:21.323 --> 00:34.282
the room had a private closet.

00:34.302 --> 00:35.083
And As I say, the front doors were steel and the 
contractor had misjudged, either the contractor

00:35.620 --> 00:58.565
misjudged the size of the door opening or they 
thought that this was going to be a good

00:35.620 --> 00:58.565
ventilating program to make those doors too 
sharp. And so each door was this far from the floor

01:05.168 --> 01:11.034
And so, as a result, if anybody down the hall 
hollered, it just reverberated through that

01:05.168 --> 01:11.034
door. Was there space over the door? No. Okay. So, 
no. It fit tight above the door and no transom. Now

01:19.664 --> 01:25.090
in the other depot dorms, every door had a transom 
up above. You could crawl up through the transom

01:25.310 --> 01:28.553
and crawl into the room. But in these dorms, they 
didn't. They had the steel door. But they... They

01:34.582 --> 01:36.866
were about this much too sharp. Later on, I 
understand, they came in, I'm sure they did what I

01:36.906 --> 01:50.649
said, and they built an attachment and they took 
those doors off and screwed on the extensions of

01:36.906 --> 01:50.649
the doors so that they eliminated the sound 
problem. Did anything ever happen under that

01:50.749 --> 01:54.376
door? Oh yeah, oh yeah. Many things happened under 
those doors. They'd throw live fire over there and

01:59.371 --> 02:03.978
everything else. Some of those old dorms, they'd 
build a fire right outside the door, and they'd

02:05.480 --> 02:15.395
knock on the door, and they'd all run and go open 
that door and have a bunch of deuce breaking and

02:05.480 --> 02:15.395
burning. I think. Was it possible to crawl under 
that door? No. Wasn't that how it was? It wasn't

02:21.203 --> 02:22.525
quite that high. You couldn't crawl under it. But 
you could sure throw things under it. All right.

02:25.810 --> 02:29.175
The new dorms then, the rooms seem bigger, nicer. 
rooms were nicer, cleaner, more modern, more

02:29.476 --> 02:36.043
up-to-date, had a nice big window. And they had a, 
what do you call these things that give off heat?

02:39.387 --> 02:40.248
Radiators. Radiators. They had radiators. They 
heated the rooms with steam heat from the tunnels.

02:47.096 --> 02:49.699
And so you all filled those dorms up. Filled them 
up. But the core could not all be accommodated over

02:52.742 --> 02:56.226
there. Most of the core was accommodated over 
there, but not the whole core. And so they still had

03:02.993 --> 03:07.379
core in the Walton Hall. They had core in Law and 
Puryear Hall. They had core in

03:09.362 --> 03:15.089
Goodwin Hall. Somewhere along was stopped being 
used as a dormitory, but not at that time. Goodwin

03:23.019 --> 03:27.445
Hall and Mitchell Hall, Law and Puryear, Hart 
Hall, were all still used by the Corps. Alright, so

03:32.059 --> 03:33.460
you're a sophomore. How much better was it to be a 
sophomore than a fish? Well, it was much better. It

03:39.186 --> 03:42.949
was much better as sophomores so we had 
responsibilities. We were ordered to try to treat

03:44.131 --> 03:48.495
the incoming freshmen as we were treated. And I 
guess we did. We tried to teach those incoming

03:54.340 --> 04:03.093
freshmen how to know everybody in the in the 
outfits by name and where they were from. I guess we

04:04.515 --> 04:15.030
mistreated them to some extent

04:04.515 --> 04:15.030
but not too badly.

04:15.050 --> 04:18.875
We had a lot of students dropping out in those days. 
About, do you remember anything about the

04:23.483 --> 04:27.949
survival rate of your freshman class next year? 
About how many? I'm gonna guess, and see company,

04:30.412 --> 04:47.474
I'm gonna guess that out of say, say we had 30 
freshmen,

04:30.412 --> 04:47.474
by the time we came back there were 20, so what would 
that be? 25%.

04:50.534 --> 04:53.378
We would drop from, say, 30 to 20. That's a third, 
isn't it? We lost a lot to academics. We lost a lot to

04:59.688 --> 05:05.056
kids who just weren't happy. And we lost some to the 
economy. So the pressure is still going on. As far

05:12.346 --> 05:17.554
as you can recall, about how much money did you 
bring with you as a freshman? Well, I brought about

05:17.838 --> 05:19.881
$25. And I brought a check that my dad had given me. 
And I wrote a check on him for my fees. Do you

05:32.677 --> 05:33.698
remember what that was? I can tell you what I went to 
school on for two semesters. I went to school as A&M

05:37.863 --> 05:44.672
and paid all my room and board and everything for 
about $360.

05:46.660 --> 05:48.063
And you didn't have a job? Not at that time, not as a 
freshman. I got a job as a sophomore for Mr. Walter,

05:50.227 --> 05:57.560
P.M. Walter. And what happened was that Chick 
Sale, who was a lieutenant and also had something

05:57.621 --> 06:07.960
to do with advertising for the battalion, And I got 
involved with Chick some way, or he had issued a

06:09.357 --> 06:22.136
call for volunteers to sell advertising for the 
battalion. And I went down there and volunteered

06:22.156 --> 06:27.765
to sell advertising. And they put me in downtown 
Bryan, calling on Walters and WSD and Jack Lester

06:27.785 --> 06:37.660
and some of those men. Called on Alistair Wallerup 
and sold him advertising for the tag. And then the

06:44.739 --> 06:50.847
next summer, I had a letter from Mr. Wallerup 
wanting to know if I wanted to go to work for him. And

06:50.867 --> 06:51.988
I said, oh, yes. He said, I'd like for you to come a 
week early so you can be here to help sell these

06:52.108 --> 07:01.340
beautiful arms. So then I worked for Mr. Wallerup 
all my sophomore and junior year. About how many

07:06.367 --> 07:07.528
hours a week? Well, I would work all afternoon 
Saturday. That would be about five hours. But we

07:17.342 --> 07:21.267
stayed open until 5 or 6 hours on Saturday. I'd work 
about 12 hours a week and he'd pay me 50 cents an

07:21.287 --> 07:26.474
hour. So I was making $12, I was making $6 an hour. 
And you were a salesman? I was a salesman. How did

07:32.442 --> 07:35.666
you get back and forth from downtown? I rode the 
bus. And do you remember what it cost? Ten cents.

07:40.225 --> 07:41.547
Ten cents. Ran about how often? It ran about every 
hour. Every hour. I'd catch the bus right there to

07:47.635 --> 07:53.643
the corner where Mr. Walters' store was on the 
corner. I'd catch it there, say, I'd catch that bus

07:53.663 --> 08:03.216
at 5.30 so I could make formation for, because I was 
the first sergeant. in the K Company, and I had to

08:04.445 --> 08:09.990
leave the company in for mess. And then my senior 
year, well I didn't work my senior year,

08:11.071 --> 08:24.524
but my sophomore year I was, I wasn't private, I 
wasn't, I guess I was a corporal or whatever they

08:11.071 --> 08:24.524
were, sophomore year. Then I became a first 
sergeant. While I was in my junior year, I had to

08:27.607 --> 08:32.832
leave the, call them to order and get them all in and 
so forth. So I had to leave in that town. But I was

08:39.186 --> 08:41.531
making about, what? I was making more than $6 a 
week. I was making about $10, $12. Right. And so you

08:48.304 --> 08:50.589
mentioned selling uniforms? Yes. Waldrop sold? 
Yeah. What were these, optional uniforms?

08:57.431 --> 09:06.540
Optional uniforms, like shirts, and ornaments, 
and ties, socks, slacks, khaki slacks. And also,

09:07.180 --> 09:11.324
remember, Aden Academy was a pretty big factory in 
those days. And those boys had to buy all their

09:11.785 --> 09:15.208
uniforms. And Mr. Waldrop was the main supplier of 
uniforms. Was he the largest men's clothing

09:19.775 --> 09:25.160
store? Yes. His was the largest men's. Another 
store across the street was WSD, but Mr. Morton did

09:28.884 --> 09:35.751
more business than anybody else. Alright, let's 
digress on downtown. Alright. Who were the major

09:38.113 --> 09:40.636
businesses downtown? Well, Caldwell Jewelry, a 
place called Creamland that was right by the Old

09:40.656 --> 09:49.765
Palace Theater. Palace Theater, across the 
street was the Dixie Theater. On the corner there

09:55.998 --> 10:02.048
was Mr. McQueen's Drugstore. Then the next 
building was Mr. Walter's, me and Walter. Then

10:06.735 --> 10:13.966
next door was the Collegiate Shop, which was a 
ladies shoe and dress shop. And then another spot

10:13.986 --> 10:18.874
down was Mr. Jack Lester's a ladies shop, and

10:20.086 --> 10:37.552
Mr. John Seely Caldwell had a jewelry store, and

10:20.086 --> 10:37.552
Sankey Park had a jewelry store. Was there a five 
and ten cent store? Yes, there was a F.W. Woolworth

10:42.680 --> 10:47.848
across the street, and there was a Perry's. And 
there were several eating restaurants. There was

10:54.319 --> 11:01.107
the LaSalle Hotel active, and they had a coffee 
shop in the LaSalle Hotel. There was a Charles

11:01.127 --> 11:09.437
Hotel across the street from the LaSalle Hotel 
with a small coffee shop in it. American Steam

11:09.577 --> 11:16.025
Laundry, Central Texas Hardware was where it was. 
The banks, the First State Bank. the City National

11:20.785 --> 11:28.656
Bank, the First National Bank, all there 
downtown. There was Howell Lumber Company,

11:28.676 --> 11:33.744
Parker Lumber Company. There was an automobile 
dealership, two of them downtown. One was a

11:39.172 --> 11:50.488
postmobile, one was a Nash & Rambler, and another 
was the

11:39.172 --> 11:50.488
Plymouth and Well, the railroad station was on the 
east end of, I mean the west end of the downtown

11:50.992 --> 12:00.123
area. The railroad station was on the west end of 
the downtown station. Now, but by this creamery

12:05.850 --> 12:09.815
was the barbershop. By the barbershop was the 
Carnegie Library. And on the other side of the

12:15.703 --> 12:18.366
Carnegie Library was Charles Hotel and a few 
little places along there. Way down at the east end

12:25.152 --> 12:28.255
of Main Street, was there an ice house? Yes. Right 
at the end was an ice house. The street was real

12:33.301 --> 12:44.854
wide, you know, they say it was designed so that a 
buggy with a team of mules or horses could make a

12:33.301 --> 12:44.854
U-turn downtown. But at the end was the old ice 
house. old shoemaker i think shoemaker

12:49.160 --> 13:17.260
wholesale grocery and ice house how often would an 
aggie student go downtown to the movie about every

12:49.160 --> 13:17.260
saturday night oh really yeah maybe maybe not on 
average quite that much but it was a usual thing to

12:49.160 --> 13:17.260
go to downtown ryan to go to movies on saturday 
night that was a big a problem with us students

13:17.425 --> 13:23.975
because we thought that she ought to have a movie 
house on the station. And she always promised us

13:24.696 --> 13:28.101
one, but never would provide one. So there wasn't a 
movie theater? No. Oh, I didn't know the campus

13:30.184 --> 13:31.686
wasn't there yet. No, there was not a movie 
theater, except the free one, which was in the

13:31.706 --> 13:39.418
old... Go ahead. No, it was in the old... Assembly 
Hall, they called it. And I'll tell you where it was

13:44.650 --> 13:46.092
located. It was right there where the chapel is. 
And they tore that down to build it. How often were

13:51.720 --> 13:53.602
those free movies? Every Sunday after lunch, they 
were free. We'd have lunch in the dining hall in

14:00.832 --> 14:05.458
Hedford. And they sold popcorn for about a nickel a 
big sack. That whole floor would be full of

14:10.245 --> 14:12.508
popcorn. But we had no movie house in College 
Station until finally the campus theater was

14:13.670 --> 14:21.740
built. And it was built about my senior year. 
Matter of fact, I was in that movie when we got word

14:26.065 --> 14:33.413
that Japan had returned to Pearl Harbor. Describe 
that. We had lunch in the dining hall. Robert

14:40.482 --> 14:43.305
Taylor in a yank at Oxford. We

14:44.365 --> 14:53.038
went to the movie.

14:53.058 --> 14:56.123
By then, it would just be blank. When everybody got 
in, we'd go to the start and have all the

14:56.504 --> 15:01.191
preliminary stuff. But anyway, we went through 
that. And then the movie started. I guess it had to

15:05.257 --> 15:07.200
be nine or ten minutes.

15:10.808 --> 15:35.451
And

15:10.808 --> 15:35.451
somebody

15:10.808 --> 15:35.451
talking on the phone, checking in with my guest, 
said that they just learned that the Japanese have

15:10.808 --> 15:35.451
attacked Pearl Harbor. And that the show would be 
shut down. And that every person in the movie

15:36.231 --> 15:37.913
theater should go to his door and wait on it. I 
turned to Bob Russell, my friend and classmate who

15:39.412 --> 15:46.623
I was with, and I said, Bob, where's Pearl Harbor? 
We didn't know where Pearl Harbor was. But we went

15:49.447 --> 15:55.857
to the room and turned the radio on, and we all 
listened. Of course, they

15:55.877 --> 16:04.930
were all hunting with the attack on Pearl Harbor 
and trying to give us news about it. What did, that

16:07.525 --> 16:12.793
night and so forth, what did you all think that 
would mean to you? We didn't know what it would mean

16:13.534 --> 16:15.638
to us. We thought that they might just take us right 
out and put us in the service. We didn't know, but we

16:19.944 --> 16:35.068
stayed on our radios until we got to classes the 
next day and they called meetings all over the

16:19.944 --> 16:35.068
campus and within a week, after they attacked 
Pearl Harbor, they totally changed our program.

16:43.669 --> 16:59.477
First thing they did, we didn't like it in our 
class, nearly threw in their rank, they said all

16:43.669 --> 16:59.477
seniors, all students will go to breakfast every 
morning. We didn't like it. All students will take

17:01.407 --> 17:06.693
calisthenics every morning before they go to 
practice. So they put a lot of new rules in

17:06.713 --> 17:11.678
immediately, all for our benefit. And as far as you 
know, those decisions were made on the campus.

17:14.741 --> 17:16.423
There wasn't an order from Washington. There was 
no order from Washington. I've gathered that the

17:18.525 --> 17:29.457
rules were made that were changed, were made by the 
administration on the campus, looking to the fact

17:29.757 --> 17:33.503
that we were gonna, we were in a war and we were gonna 
have to do things all different. And I was put under

17:34.604 --> 17:44.379
tremendous pressure as president of the senior 
class because I had all the boys that were seniors,

17:34.604 --> 17:44.379
they were saying, well we'll just give up our 
contracts. And I had to deal with that. And I

17:48.325 --> 17:54.174
finally took some of the leaders of the class, plus 
some of the biggest rabble-rousers, and I went to

17:48.325 --> 17:54.174
Houston. I called Colonel I. Gashburn, who was my 
good friend, I said, I've got to bring these boys

17:58.293 --> 18:04.402
down, and this whole city class is about to walk 
out. And I said, I don't want them to walk out. I want

18:05.925 --> 18:07.728
them to stay here. And I took some of them. I figured 
the worst rabble-rousers, I'd just take them. And

18:12.695 --> 18:14.718
I took some of them with me. And he talked to us up in 
his office for about two hours. He said, boys, it's

18:18.284 --> 18:21.349
a war. By that time, he was head of the, he'd just 
been made governor. A little later, he was head of

18:25.141 --> 18:29.226
the Chamber of Commerce at the time. But he was 
later made head of the top shipyard. But anyway, he

18:34.432 --> 18:40.820
told a decent boy, he said, this thing is 
important. And we came back, and he kind of

18:40.840 --> 18:44.925
persuaded them. We called a meeting, and these 
rabble-rabblers got up and said, hell, I was

18:44.945 --> 18:52.694
against this whole thing, but now I'm part of it. 
You've got to keep your connections. Now, they

18:54.638 --> 19:03.416
were not thinking about resigning their 
commission to avoid active duty, were they? No,

19:03.436 --> 19:04.718
no. It was a protest over having to... These 
routines. Yeah, protest against the routines.

19:10.429 --> 19:11.953
Not to avoid active duty. They were perfectly 
willing to fight. Right. But they just didn't like

19:14.821 --> 19:20.126
the idea of the administration telling them they 
had to change their routine. You know how Aggies

19:20.306 --> 19:21.567
are. Do you remember in those first few nights, do 
you remember talking with friends, maybe after

19:21.587 --> 19:33.558
the light was turned off in your room and so forth, 
about what it might mean in your lives? Oh, yeah.

19:35.680 --> 19:36.561
Oh, yeah. We discussed it.

19:42.566 --> 19:43.427
What kind of a... combat we were going to be in. As a 
matter of fact, several of my friends and I

19:46.661 --> 19:58.535
transferred from the infantry into the Air Force, 
not necessarily to get away from the infantry. But

19:58.615 --> 20:06.083
more important, we felt like the Air Force was 
going to be a more glamorous thing to be in and more

19:58.615 --> 20:06.083
exciting. And I did transfer and stayed four years 
in the Air Force, but I never got to fly because By

20:13.242 --> 20:24.558
the time I got ready to fly and applied for my flight 
school, I was already a captain in the Air Force.

20:24.838 --> 20:31.828
And I got promoted in 90 days from a second 
lieutenant to a first lieutenant. And then I got

20:31.848 --> 20:40.380
promoted in six months, which was the minimum you 
could serve a first lieutenant to be a captain. six

20:41.373 --> 21:07.549
months I was promoted to captain and I applied for 
the flying school and I got turned down because not

20:41.373 --> 21:07.549
necessarily turned down but they said we are not 
taking captains in grade in flying school they

20:41.373 --> 21:07.549
said now if you want to revert to a second 
lieutenant we will enroll you in flying school and

20:41.373 --> 21:07.549
I said I don't want to drop two levels back to go to 
flying school So I turned it back. You go on active

21:09.567 --> 21:12.050
duty after graduation? The day after graduation. 
In 42? In 42. During that, those six months or so

21:15.313 --> 21:29.166
from Pearl Harbor to graduation, did the conduct, 
the behavior of the Corps members change? Did

21:29.446 --> 21:30.867
things become more serious? Things became very 
much more serious. They gave us a Christmas

21:34.651 --> 21:36.793
holiday. But it was one week where we hadn't been 
getting two weeks. We got five days off for

21:43.194 --> 21:47.039
Christmas. We all came back. They eliminated what 
was spring break, and they eliminated any other

21:50.023 --> 21:58.274
holidays. And so they graduated us two weeks 
early, escalated our And so, we graduated on

22:07.030 --> 22:18.681
May the 15th.

22:20.923 --> 22:26.849
And I reported to active, we were commissioned on 
the afternoon of May 15th. And I reported to active

22:26.869 --> 22:33.876
duty at Ellington Field in Houston on May 16th. I 
never even went home. My mother and daddy came down

22:37.287 --> 22:48.241
here from Greenville to see me graduate, and then 
they left and went back to Greenville, and I went to

22:37.287 --> 22:48.241
Ellicott. Are you the oldest? No, I was the middle. 
Okay, so you were not the first? No, I was the

22:55.851 --> 22:57.333
middle. I was the third one to go to college. What 
were their feelings, as far as you could tell, at

23:05.300 --> 23:09.065
graduation, knowing you were going to have to go on 
active duty right then? Well, they were

23:09.545 --> 23:12.449
concerned. Because I was the first one in my family 
to go in the military. My older brother came in

23:18.076 --> 23:27.247
after I went in, and my brother-in-law came in 
after I, so I was the first one in my family. My

23:28.309 --> 23:32.073
father was very proud of the fact that I was going. 
He seemed not concerned about My mother was

23:35.877 --> 23:43.467
concerned, though I don't think either one of them 
really realized what was ahead for all of us. I

23:43.727 --> 23:52.840
don't think they had much comprehension about 
what was going

23:43.727 --> 23:52.840
to happen. But we didn't know either. We knew we 
were in a war and we know there's going to be a lot of

23:54.282 --> 24:04.315
shooting and a lot of death and a lot of terrible 
things happen. We were ready for it. I mean, we

24:06.789 --> 24:17.204
didn't,

24:06.789 --> 24:17.204
we weren't dodging any traps or shirking any dead 
people. Did you know anybody back home in

24:17.224 --> 24:27.499
Greenwood or anywhere else that you thought of 
that did try to avoid?

24:31.345 --> 24:32.867
I didn't know a single soul. I knew a lot of people, 
being a leader of the class, I didn't know a single

24:35.345 --> 24:49.217
Aggie that attempted to avoid 100% service. Now I 
did have some friends who were not able to go in

24:49.238 --> 24:53.702
because they couldn't pass. They physically 
couldn't. And they were very upset about the fact

24:57.465 --> 25:05.352
that they wouldn't take them in because they had 
diabetes a heart flutter or some physical problem

25:05.686 --> 25:11.311
that would just not let them go in. And so they had to 
do something else, but I don't know of any, anybody

25:12.091 --> 25:23.781
that tried to avoid service. Were any of the, this 
is a turning point, were any of the Kishy boys here

25:24.382 --> 25:29.866
then?

25:32.629 --> 25:35.271
No, I don't think so, but there was, There was Yee,

25:36.533 --> 25:45.042
Henry Yee. What about Henry Kawahata? Kawahata 
was here. As a matter of fact, Henry Kawahata was

25:50.248 --> 25:54.533
over there, close to C Company. I guess Henry was in 
A Company. Henry Kawahata, Henry Yee, Howard

25:57.757 --> 26:05.325
Chang,

26:05.963 --> 26:16.577
another Japanese boy, I don't know his name, that 
the FBI thought may be a sympathizer.

26:16.938 --> 26:22.826
Did any students pick on them, tease them? No. 
Actually,

26:24.348 --> 26:35.683
Chang was a Hawaiian, and Chang left A&M shortly 
after and went back to Hawaii because they

26:36.187 --> 26:44.915
attacked him. So he didn't finish his semester. 
When I was in Kunming, China, I got out of the plane

26:48.418 --> 26:56.484
and went in to the operations officer in Kunming, 
China. Here was Henry Yee. He was a class of 41, a

26:59.007 --> 27:02.510
year ahead of me. And he was a captain. I spoke to 
him. We had a good visit. He was as busy as any

27:08.843 --> 27:13.388
American you could find. I'm not sure whether he 
was Chinese or Japanese. I think he was Chinese.

27:18.975 --> 27:35.455
But anyway, it was a wonderful experience to see 
the willingness of the young men of Texas at that

27:18.975 --> 27:35.455
time who wanted to be of service at that time. At 
that commencement, do you remember what it was

27:40.634 --> 27:47.420
like, who the speaker was, what the emphasis was? 
Yes, I can tell you.

27:53.006 --> 27:53.706
I can tell you. We had the graduation commencement 
exercise at the U end of Kyle Field.

28:03.556 --> 28:05.037
Tom Gillis was cadet colonel and valedictorian of 
the class. He was cadet colonel and

28:08.978 --> 28:11.400
valedictorian. He got the months. He couldn't 
function as the valedictory address. So they

28:19.808 --> 28:25.173
called on our friend Fred Smith to give it in Tom's 
place. So Tom presented the valedictory address

28:25.193 --> 28:30.598
that, I mean Fred did, in Tom's name. Anyway, they 
had a man coming from Dallas to make the

28:34.413 --> 28:40.879
commencement

28:34.413 --> 28:40.879
address. For some reason, he was delayed getting 
there. So old General Breeze, his picture's in

28:44.763 --> 28:54.293
that manual I saw, General Breeze, they called on 
him to give an extemporaneous speech. He stood up

28:55.614 --> 29:00.379
and made a 45 minute extemporaneous speech. Right 
at the end of his speech, the real

29:07.792 --> 29:14.122
And so then they introduced him, and he made his 
45-minute speech. So we got two, a double barrel

29:14.142 --> 29:19.911
full of commencement speeches. And then that 
afternoon, about 1.30 or 2 o'clock, we went to Guy

29:19.931 --> 29:25.860
Hall. And

29:27.763 --> 29:33.412
we were commissioned. We got commissioned. I 
know.

29:40.765 --> 29:50.677
Uh, was, did the commissioning speaker have 
anything memorable to say about what y'all were

29:40.765 --> 29:50.677
headed into? I don't remember hardly a thing about 
what they had to say. The most meaningful one that I

29:56.003 --> 30:10.620
remember talking about it was Colonel Eichmann 
when I had those boys down in his office about what,

29:56.003 --> 30:10.620
you see he'd been a major in World War I and he'd been 
in the trenches. And he knew what was coming up. And

30:13.693 --> 30:21.924
he just talked, put serious talk right to it and 
said, boys, I don't know whether you realize it or

30:13.693 --> 30:21.924
not, but we're in a terrible war. And he said, 
you're going to have to fight. You're going to have

30:25.790 --> 30:26.671
to go. You're going to be in a shooting war. And we 
really, outside of this conversation, I don't

30:31.177 --> 30:38.447
remember what these two people, I was so excited 
about that. And I think most of them. As a matter of

30:40.208 --> 30:44.091
fact, I've talked to my classmates frequently, 
and I said, what did they say? We had two

30:44.492 --> 30:46.233
commencement addresses. Do you remember a damn 
thing any one of them said? None of them. Was

30:51.818 --> 30:57.102
commencement then, about like it is now, every 
name called, every hand shaken? Right. All right,

30:57.963 --> 31:00.465
so your mom and dad came down. Right. Did you give 
them some of your belongings? Yes, I did. They took

31:05.429 --> 31:06.950
them back to Greenville. That's my diploma. 
That's my diploma. I gave them everything that I

31:09.190 --> 31:14.015
didn't need, and they took it back to Greenwood. 
And did you have a car by then? My brother had given

31:15.797 --> 31:17.519
me a car. He had a little, he'd been drafted into the 
service. He had a little 39 Ford Coupe, which he

31:21.783 --> 31:24.986
gave to me. So you drove that to Ellicott? I drove 
that to Ellicott Field, and then we were there two

31:26.247 --> 31:35.637
weeks, and we got orders to go to MacDill Field, 
Florida, and Warren Ringo, and Bill Bannister and

31:36.376 --> 31:41.688
I got in that little Ford and drove to the park. 
Alright, let's go back and recall some students.

31:48.284 --> 31:53.676
Memorable teachers, advisors, people that made a 
difference for you.
