00:02.647 --> 00:06.913
What percentage of the students at UT agreed with 
your views, do you think?

00:11.379 --> 00:18.048
Oh, I would say any, oh goodness, I would probably 
tend to estimate too high. But there was usually a

00:18.849 --> 00:28.402
pretty sharp line drawn between, if you were 
associated in any way with a fraternity or

00:18.849 --> 00:28.402
sorority, first of all, you were just considered 
dead meat. But those people didn't go along with

00:29.223 --> 00:32.367
it. But that's okay because we never saw them. They 
were too busy going to their little formals and

00:35.375 --> 00:42.185
semi-formals, and we were too busy making 
horrendous fun of them.

00:43.787 --> 00:55.644
These were the people who wore nylons and heels and 
preppy-type attire at a time when most people were

00:43.787 --> 00:55.644
wearing faded jeans with holes in them and baggy 
shirts and no bra, so you can imagine. But I would

00:55.664 --> 00:59.569
say probably a good... 70 to 80% of the students at 
the University of Texas at the time. And that might

01:06.471 --> 01:12.858
be high, though, but it's just that everybody I 
knew and associated with supported it. So it seems

01:12.878 --> 01:14.880
to me that it was high. I'm not sure actually of the 
figure, though.

01:20.286 --> 01:24.971
Why do you think SDS fell apart as a national 
organization? Boy, because they started getting

01:26.473 --> 01:29.556
really violent. And the disruptive services that 
we were doing were one thing, but the actual

01:29.890 --> 01:53.907
bombing of selective service offices, and

01:29.890 --> 01:53.907
of course there was a tragic accident where some 
SDS members were involved in making a bomb and it

01:29.890 --> 01:53.907
blew up in the basement of the home and killed three 
of the guys. I guess that sort of started hitting,

01:55.625 --> 01:59.429
hey, what we're doing is really deadly. People can 
really get hurt. I mean, it's one thing to cut

02:00.931 --> 02:17.669
telephone lines to the draft board or the 
Selective Service Agency or to cause phone lines

02:00.931 --> 02:17.669
to go out on college campuses or just to generally 
harass people. But when you start really talking

02:19.051 --> 02:24.096
about people dying and getting hurt and... 
putting bombs on trains that were carrying

02:24.616 --> 02:46.267
military supplies and trying to disrupt, going 
onto military bases and trying to blow up arsenals

02:24.616 --> 02:46.267
and

02:24.616 --> 02:46.267
deploy or transports to Vietnam. And even there 
was talk of blowing up various senators and House

02:53.405 --> 03:01.112
of Representatives members' homes and 
kidnapping of children. It just got so splintered

03:02.013 --> 03:08.600
that it became an organization. The Weathermen 
became an organization of people who were really,

03:08.660 --> 03:19.691
at least for me, they wanted to do things that were 
much more violent than I was into. I did not want...

03:22.514 --> 03:26.739
I did not want to see anybody murdered or killed or 
seriously hurt. I mean, if I could call someone

03:26.819 --> 03:36.610
public embarrassment and shame them or expose 
them for what they were doing, that was one thing.

03:37.571 --> 03:40.434
But to actually call somebody physical or body 
harm, uh-uh. That's why it fell apart for me.

03:47.682 --> 03:51.947
Okay, what were some of the accomplishments of 
SDS?

03:54.222 --> 04:23.959
Well, at the University of Texas, and that was the 
only place I was involved with it, I think we were

03:54.222 --> 04:23.959
very successful in making people aware that you 
could use more than peaceful demonstration to get

03:54.222 --> 04:23.959
your point across and that people, especially 
people in administrative positions, responded

03:54.222 --> 04:23.959
to... the type of activities that I've mentioned 
before that we were involved in a whole lot more

04:24.800 --> 04:35.738
speedily than they did with just a whole bunch of 
kids sitting out on the greenways or the or the

04:36.545 --> 04:40.571
college campuses chanting, you know, hell no, we 
won't go. If you could actually get into a building

04:40.731 --> 04:49.483
and take over the dean's office or make an uproar 
like this, then you got the media called in. And now

04:49.543 --> 04:55.311
the University of Texas is on national TV and 
parents are saying, wait a minute, we don't want

04:49.543 --> 04:55.311
our kids to go there. So it was much more... It 
brought about much quicker results and

05:00.203 --> 05:03.287
responses. We didn't, you know, it wasn't just a 
bunch of, oh, aren't they sweet? Look at those kids

05:06.631 --> 05:12.518
sitting out by the trees, singing and chanting 
their little anti-war songs. Okay, well, they'll

05:12.618 --> 05:14.480
go away when they get hungry. You know, this was, 
you know, let's do something else. So I do think we

05:21.128 --> 05:22.870
brought a... The university administration 
seemed to respond much more readily when they

05:23.693 --> 05:36.192
thought that damage or disruption was going to 
occur than if they thought it was just pure

05:23.693 --> 05:36.192
peaceful marches.

05:40.037 --> 05:45.766
What did it mean to be a radical, or could you define 
a radical in the time?

05:51.615 --> 05:51.895
Well, I guess there were various levels of 
radicals, but a real radical

05:54.507 --> 06:13.291
was someone who...

05:54.507 --> 06:13.291
Jane Fonda was a radical. She went to Hanoi.

06:18.658 --> 06:21.061
She said she regrets it. I think that's a 
political... That was a pretty radical thing to

06:24.764 --> 06:36.060
do, to go to Hanoi and talk to the Vietnamese and 
take pictures smiling arm in arm with the

06:24.764 --> 06:36.060
Vietnamese. That was radical.

06:41.167 --> 06:44.832
To my parents, radical meant people who shouted 
against the government and caused a scene.

06:50.996 --> 06:52.498
Anybody that caused a scene. My mother, that was 
her great fear that I was going to cause a scene,

06:52.578 --> 07:01.930
which I was involved in many scenes. But that just 
wasn't ladylike. A radical was somebody who

07:08.960 --> 07:13.207
departed from what, and I guess it depends on who 
was calling you a radical. That was in the eye of the

07:13.347 --> 07:15.611
beholder. I mean, I wasn't a radical to my friends. 
They felt the same way. Somebody radical to us

07:21.941 --> 07:26.909
would have been a Green Beret or a Marine. He was 
radical. But I'm sure we were radical to him. At the

07:32.602 --> 07:41.750
time, a radical was somebody who felt much like the 
people, probably, who established the original

07:32.602 --> 07:41.750
colonies and wanted to overthrow the English 
government. Those were considered radicals over

07:41.970 --> 07:45.333
in the House of Parliament. And I'm sure we were 
considered radicals by the powers that be here

07:46.154 --> 07:53.381
because we wanted an overthrow of the way things 
were being done.

07:57.324 --> 08:00.567
What were your feelings towards Texas A&M at the 
time?

08:04.124 --> 08:06.151
Those people were from another planet. They were 
so out of what was going on. They just had... I mean,

08:11.510 --> 08:15.163
when people said Texas A&M, we envisioned... a 
bunch of Marines and farmers, or a combination of

08:15.515 --> 08:20.139
the two. People who were just so incapable of any 
independent thinking, who were just going to go

08:20.500 --> 08:27.906
right along. The only solace we took in the fact was 
that most of them were being drafted so quickly

08:27.966 --> 08:34.052
that we knew they'd be killed. And that perhaps all 
that thinking would just be slaughtered on the

08:34.753 --> 08:40.678
fields over in Vietnam. And it was best that these 
people hopefully not reproduce before they left.

08:44.962 --> 08:49.626
and leave behind widows and children who might 
carry on this belief. And we truly hope that they

08:50.647 --> 08:59.816
did not think they were fighting for us because we 
didn't want them to fight for us. We wanted them not

09:00.877 --> 09:02.278
to go. We really felt that if people, if the young 
men just burned their death cards and said, you

09:02.718 --> 09:07.983
want to fight a war? That politician, you go there 
and get it done and you fight it. But here were these

09:11.346 --> 09:14.209
little A&M people watching information, you 
know, and drilling every morning and just dying to

09:14.459 --> 09:20.886
get over there. We waved goodbye.

09:27.494 --> 09:28.955
When did the 60s end?

09:32.700 --> 09:35.903
Hmm.

09:35.923 --> 09:37.305
The 60s ended for me in 1971. I

09:37.465 --> 09:42.711
left the United States

09:46.252 --> 09:55.403
thinking it was for good, and went over to Israel.

09:55.423 --> 10:00.749
And more or less just sort of deliberately

09:55.423 --> 10:00.749
lost touch. I didn't want to know anything that was 
going on. When I came back in 70, excuse me, I went

10:04.554 --> 10:15.887
over in late 1970 and came back over in 72,

10:17.960 --> 10:25.950
When I returned to the United States, back to 
Austin, it was like the 60s just hadn't even

10:17.960 --> 10:25.950
existed. People were walking to classes. People 
were going to classes. Your professors expected

10:28.554 --> 10:30.476
you in class.

10:33.480 --> 10:34.782
It was a whole different scene.

10:37.666 --> 10:43.173
I might add, when I went to Israel, my father felt 
that was the place I belonged. My parents were not

10:43.193 --> 10:44.515
Jewish. My husband at the time was Jewish. So I 
guess I lived up to some of their expectations. But

10:50.398 --> 10:53.930
a lot of the 60s moved what was blamed on Jews. And it 
was felt that a lot of Abby Hoffman, Jerry Rubin,

10:59.067 --> 11:06.117
And these people, that Jews were behind a lot of the 
black civil rights movement, too. That the blacks

11:06.478 --> 11:13.588
were banned, or the Jewish people were standing 
behind the blacks in their rights movements. And

11:13.608 --> 11:22.140
that Jews stood something to gain by claiming that 
the blacks were persecuted because they had been

11:13.608 --> 11:22.140
persecuted, too. And for a long time, there was a 
pretty tight between the blacks and the Jews, but

11:26.185 --> 11:32.213
I've seen that erode over the years. Because I 
think the blacks realize they've been used by the

11:32.233 --> 11:38.401
Jews.

11:38.421 --> 11:42.246
But who hasn't? Do you consider yourself a 
liberated woman?

11:49.216 --> 11:51.379
Why, yes. Certainly more than anything else. 
Could you define it? I do not need a man to identify

11:57.235 --> 12:00.143
myself. I do not need a man to be happy. I am as 
capable of... If someone told me I could either

12:05.637 --> 12:12.274
take

12:15.460 --> 12:27.598
If I was going to be stranded on a desert island or a 
deserted island for the rest of my life and someone

12:15.460 --> 12:27.598
said, you can either take good books or a good man, 
I'd take the books. I think I'd enjoy them a lot

12:28.900 --> 12:31.164
longer. I think I wouldn't have to do any laundry or 
cook if I didn't feel like it. You can use them again

12:37.133 --> 12:38.615
and again. The older I get, the happier I am that 
that somewhere along the way I distanced myself

12:44.384 --> 12:49.930
emotionally from men. Even the most sensitive, 
liberated men I knew mostly gave lip service to

12:50.751 --> 13:00.481
women and their causes.

13:05.367 --> 13:13.075
The division between the sexes, I don't think it's 
really narrowed that much, but I know best that

13:14.000 --> 13:41.003
that I can, I enjoy the company of men, and I enjoy 
sex with men, and I'm not gay, if I were it wouldn't

13:14.000 --> 13:41.003
bother me to tell you that I was, but I'm not gay, and 
I do enjoy sex with men, but I think I'm able to enjoy

13:14.000 --> 13:41.003
it without wanting or needing any commitment, I 
don't feel that I am bound by something that would

13:42.029 --> 13:49.842
have bound my mother, which is the sanctity of 
marriage. I don't think that people are meant to be

13:51.285 --> 13:55.271
monogamous. I don't think it's normal or natural. 
I don't expect it from myself or from others. I

14:02.431 --> 14:07.778
would never feel betrayed if the man I was with had 
sex with someone else. I think that's a television

14:07.838 --> 14:12.344
and movie hype when people freak out over that. 
Because I think most people who have been involved

14:12.404 --> 14:21.817
in relationships for any time know that not all of 
us are like Jimmy Carter and lust only in our

14:12.404 --> 14:21.817
hearts. I'm a person who has to experience a lot of 
things. I need a lot of stimuli. And I'm not going to

14:28.486 --> 14:31.510
deny myself...

14:34.139 --> 14:39.386
just because some religion or some social norm 
thinks that's what I should do. And I guess that's

14:40.828 --> 14:42.951
what I mean by being liberated. I do my thinking for 
myself. It doesn't come out of a prayer book, and it

14:45.534 --> 14:55.607
doesn't come on the dictates of what society tells 
me a good woman and a good wife should be.

15:01.156 --> 15:05.861
Did being in SDS have any impact on the increase in 
women's liberation? Well, I think for me it did.

15:11.508 --> 15:14.771
Because as I mentioned earlier, sex was a big part 
of the 60s. And the men in SDS really expected as

15:15.292 --> 15:28.767
part of your deal that you would be very open 
sexually, you know. In order for me to have sex with

15:29.742 --> 15:39.497
someone, I have to be attracted to that person, and 
I'm not going to have sex with you just because it's

15:29.742 --> 15:39.497
the thing to do that you happen to think it's the 
thing to do. But even in SDS at the time, as I look

15:39.537 --> 15:49.271
back on it, women's role in the SDS was pretty much 
just the old vessel. I mean, you were there to rub

15:49.432 --> 15:54.940
their backs and to... oh you could make a few 
speeches you know because after all they were

15:56.152 --> 16:21.923
supposed to be open-minded and liberal but uh it 
was more like you were tolerated when i look back on

15:56.152 --> 16:21.923
it you were uh you were seen as a necessary evil you 
know yeah yeah we gotta let her speak for a while but

15:56.152 --> 16:21.923
then we can get to one of us important men they seem 
to be very headstrong they seem to know exactly

15:56.152 --> 16:21.923
what they wanted and I haven't had one guy write 
something that he wanted me to say. And I said, I can

16:26.583 --> 16:28.545
write my own speeches. And he was like, no, no, no. 
We don't want you to get emotional. I just remember

16:33.672 --> 16:44.546
thinking, what in the world? How do you feel about 
our government today?

16:50.554 --> 16:51.876
Our government today? Whose government? How can 
you even use the word our? We don't have an our

16:56.793 --> 16:58.956
government. There is no our government. It's 
still the government of the rich protecting the

17:01.761 --> 17:07.169
rich. Our government. Do you think our government 
serves women and men and blacks and Chicanos and

17:08.431 --> 17:19.989
Asians? I mean, what a joke. Our government. I can 
hardly even deal with this question because I

17:22.282 --> 17:28.990
don't know what you mean by our government. If you 
mean how do I feel about the government of the

17:29.731 --> 17:39.242
United States and comparing it with the 60s, then I 
don't see much change. People have become

17:40.183 --> 17:41.765
disillusioned. It seems like the only Kennedy 
left is You know, the one they decided not to

17:44.945 --> 17:52.520
politically assassinate is the one that was the 
most intellectually harmless.

17:55.305 --> 17:57.730
I don't see that. I think it's just as corrupt and 
as... When you cannot have a... person elected to

18:04.688 --> 18:11.819
the Supreme Court of the United States because it 
was reported that he smoked marijuana in college.

18:11.839 --> 18:16.365
I think that is so hypocritical that I hardly know 
how to deal with it. I mean, most people are elected

18:16.385 --> 18:23.936
to government based on the amount of money they can 
spend in the campaign. Our

18:25.679 --> 18:33.210
government is still a big popularity contest on a 
lot of levels. name recognition most people don't

18:33.578 --> 19:00.801
even know who they vote for most people don't even 
vote for our government how do i feel about our

18:33.578 --> 19:00.801
government i don't feel like it's my government i 
don't feel like it's your government i think

18:33.578 --> 19:00.801
they've got a real good sham going i suppose but 
people don't really put much stock in the

18:33.578 --> 19:00.801
government sometimes i wonder who really does run 
the country i mean we know it's not the president

19:02.975 --> 19:08.165
That might be interesting

19:02.975 --> 19:08.165
to explore. What were your feelings on Richard 
Nixon? Richard Nixon and I shared the same date of

19:10.710 --> 19:19.127
birth as far as January 9th went. And every January 
9th for years, my birthday was ruined by watching

19:19.563 --> 19:36.319
Nixon blow out his candles on TV while I was trying 
to celebrate it with my SDS and free love, free sex,

19:19.563 --> 19:36.319
free drugs society group of people. Nixon was a 
jerk. And it's just a shame that it wasn't until

19:39.242 --> 19:46.549
1973 that the rest of the people came to know what a 
lying scum bucket he really was. I sometimes

19:46.850 --> 19:54.967
wondered how all those people from A&M who went off 
to bleed and die for this guy felt about seeing him

19:46.850 --> 19:54.967
exposed on such a level. Although the general 
sentiment of the people was Nixon hadn't done

19:55.368 --> 20:01.721
anything that anybody else hadn't done. Nixon had 
only gotten caught. So if that doesn't make more of

20:05.108 --> 20:14.279
a statement on our government, whereas people 
weren't really surprised that this had gone on in

20:05.108 --> 20:14.279
our Watergate, no, that's no big shock. He hadn't 
done anything that wrong, but how could he be so

20:14.299 --> 20:17.643
stupid as to get caught?

20:21.628 --> 20:27.235
Do you feel the Middle East crisis today compares 
with the Vietnam War, and if so, how?

20:31.855 --> 20:37.560
Not yet, but I think that it has the potential to. On 
the front page of this morning, November 17th,

20:37.680 --> 20:53.875
1990, Houston Chronicle, there's a headline that 
says that major involvement in the Middle East

20:37.680 --> 20:53.875
crisis could lead to campus disrest or unrest. And 
that's like a first little signal. I thought to

20:56.618 --> 21:01.002
myself, I should cut this out and save this. 
Because if it does escalate, it would be an

21:01.353 --> 21:04.757
interesting headline to keep. I think it's there. 
The problem is how much the government,

21:09.002 --> 21:31.309
our government,

21:09.002 --> 21:31.309
can convince people that our welfare is tied into 
our keeping the resources of the Middle East in

21:09.002 --> 21:31.309
line. They've got us all believing that we need 
that Mideast oil to pollute our place. So I guess it

21:38.250 --> 21:41.714
just depends. We were in Vietnam strictly to keep 
democracy or to police the democratic process,

21:42.114 --> 21:50.823
supposedly. We're not in the Middle East under 
those auspices. We're in the Middle East to

21:54.026 --> 21:58.070
protect our oil rights. I guess we're there for the 
money. And it's the first word that we're going to

22:02.086 --> 22:08.517
be admittedly there for financial reasons alone. 
This ought to be an interesting one, because the

22:08.537 --> 22:18.855
wealthy really stand to gain from this, and the 
poor just stand to bleed some more.

22:18.875 --> 22:23.082
Do you think a peace movement today, if it came to 
that, would be possible?

22:25.711 --> 22:33.644
I don't think so because your generation has been 
raised or reared on a steady diet of violence. The

22:35.246 --> 22:42.177
TV, the movies, your music, it's extremely 
violent in nature. Whereas we watch things, big

22:44.220 --> 22:52.714
movies at our time were The Endless Summer or What 
was another big movie back then? I can't even

22:56.711 --> 22:59.495
think. Well, then the summer will do. You've grown 
up on Robocop and The Avenger and Mad Max, and even

23:02.319 --> 23:11.371
your cartoons are so violent. It's an age where we 
have teenagers in wealthy societies Killing

23:22.208 --> 23:32.142
other teenagers for car stereos and where people 
are killed just because somebody else wants to see

23:22.208 --> 23:32.142
what it looks like to see someone die. Or cases 
where during sex other people choke. Your partner

23:37.850 --> 23:40.994
might just decide he wants to choke you to death. 
See what that's like. The drugs that you're

23:44.639 --> 23:46.562
involved in. people are willing to take these 
manufactured drugs just for the high when they

23:47.032 --> 24:11.841
don't even have any idea what's in those drugs 
marijuana is just not enough it's you're looking

23:47.032 --> 24:11.841
for drugs that produce and by you i mean that 
particular generation that produce violent

23:47.032 --> 24:11.841
reactions hallucinogenic reactions that just 
throw your body so out of kilter and out of sync that

24:12.428 --> 24:16.094
people don't even really realize what they're 
doing under the influence. Under marijuana, you

24:16.155 --> 24:21.684
don't feel violent. You feel laid back. Under a lot 
of these acids, people get so hyper and so...

24:24.549 --> 24:34.807
People get so schizoid and freaky that... And 
cocaine, imagine that. Talk about just a sheer

24:34.827 --> 24:36.951
rush high. You can't be doing it for the effect 
because the effect is too short-lived. I mean,

24:42.609 --> 24:48.234
it's not just a nice way to kick back and enjoy a 
Friday evening.

24:49.876 --> 24:58.344
No, I don't think you could have a peace movement 
because you haven't been, you're not steeped in

24:49.876 --> 24:58.344
peace and a peaceful approach to things. You want 
to blow it up, shoot it up, destroy it.

25:08.437 --> 25:34.714
Lately with the resurgence of the Vietnam War and 
all of the films that were showing how the Vietnam

25:08.437 --> 25:34.714
War veteran was so maligned and mistreated, Burn 
on the Fourth of July, Platoon,

25:08.437 --> 25:34.714
Hamburger Hill, whatever these movies were, I 
think It's also made young people today more aware

25:34.981 --> 26:01.512
of what a screwed up war that was and how we really 
had no place over there and even the soldiers came

25:34.981 --> 26:01.512
to believe it so that young men getting ready to go 
off to the Mideast today are probably going to cast

25:34.981 --> 26:01.512
a pretty jaundiced eye towards an American 
involvement in a place that really doesn't or who

25:34.981 --> 26:01.512
they feel we really shouldn't be. And I don't think 
they will just be very content to peacefully march

26:02.977 --> 26:09.587
around and say, hell no, we won't go. I think that's 
why the government's not so quick to push it. And

26:14.053 --> 26:22.886
also the parents now of many of those people in the 
60s have young sons and daughters who would be

26:14.053 --> 26:22.886
required to go. And I think the government knows

26:23.366 --> 26:28.714
that... The parents wouldn't support that. I 
don't think people in my generation, I have a

26:33.587 --> 26:37.092
17-year-old son, I don't want him to go. I would 
advise him not to go. And

26:39.295 --> 26:55.596
even parents, fathers or mothers who were over in 
Vietnam know or came to realize that that was

26:39.295 --> 26:55.596
really a war

26:58.529 --> 27:01.234
that Americans should have stayed out of. And they 
probably wouldn't want their sons over there. So

27:05.963 --> 27:17.044
either the government's going to have to come up 
with another real sneaky thing like Pearl Harbor

27:05.963 --> 27:17.044
to incite American support over there, which is 
really a scary but not unbelievable thought.

27:19.471 --> 27:22.321
or they're not going to have the support they need 
for that war. So I think we should all be thinking

27:22.341 --> 27:28.924
right now, what are they going to do to incite us to 
want to go over there?
