WEBVTT

00:03.085 --> 00:06.609
Dr. Abbott. What made him so, what were his 
character that made him such an outstanding

00:06.629 --> 00:12.376
teacher? Well, he just made things so 
interesting. I remember the first course I had

00:16.542 --> 00:23.971
under Dr. Abbott was Logic and Argumentation.

00:26.434 --> 00:30.679
And he would have us read articles and Harper's 
Magazine or other magazines. And he said, come

00:35.815 --> 00:41.864
prepared to

00:35.815 --> 00:41.864
talk about it. And we knew we should read that 
article and think about it because he was going to

00:41.884 --> 00:46.851
call on us. He just, he just imparted information 
into us and made us think, made us talk. And was just

00:57.848 --> 00:59.991
a great teacher. Dr. Bill

01:00.730 --> 01:19.679
Potts,

01:00.730 --> 01:19.679
chemistry, was one of my great teachers there, I 
recall very well. He was just a very easy going man

01:19.699 --> 01:24.426
that, he didn't lecture, Tom Harrington and 
Colonel Brighton lectured to us, but Dr. Bill

01:24.794 --> 01:33.629
Potts was our lab teacher and our classroom 
teacher in chemistry, and he was outstanding. If

01:33.649 --> 01:38.518
you had any questions, he wouldn't just go over 
subjects and say, I want you to understand this.

01:38.538 --> 01:47.854
We're going over it until everybody in this class 
understands

01:38.538 --> 01:47.854
what we're talking about. And he was awfully good. 
Others were Pembroke,

01:50.663 --> 01:59.736
Dean Pembroke, he was head of the Bureau. And he was 
very impressive and very good, had a good

01:59.756 --> 02:07.708
relationship

01:59.756 --> 02:07.708
with the students. Mr. Angel, Lionel Angel, he was 
more or less the, he would have been more or less

02:07.728 --> 02:18.223
student activities. Joe Skiles, who at that time 
was a plunder Mr. H in the student activities. Of

02:25.671 --> 02:34.960
course, I did a lot of work with the student 
activities because I was kind of one of the leaders

02:25.671 --> 02:34.960
of the class.

02:35.020 --> 02:35.901
Military people. What about over in business? 
Over in business, okay. Tom Cherry.

02:45.210 --> 02:47.552
Pop Weinke was an accountant. Stubbs,

02:48.528 --> 03:06.605
B-Bow, Harley B-Bow, they were all in Hagee Co. Tom 
Cherry was in Hagee Co. Mr. Wheeler-Martin was

02:48.528 --> 03:06.605
head of the department, but I never did head as a 
teacher. Mr., I'll tell you somebody who was a good

03:06.625 --> 03:15.374
teacher also was head of the department, was Mr. 
Leland. Mr. Leland was a good teacher. We had very

03:17.300 --> 03:20.704
caring faculty. What about advisors, 
counselors, if you needed advice on something?

03:25.509 --> 03:32.297
Well, I don't remember any counselor that I had 
other than professors. But I had no problem going

03:33.659 --> 03:36.582
to any of my teachers. They were always there and 
their door was always open. I think if there's

03:42.409 --> 03:46.834
anything good about A&M in those days, it was the 
faculty. What were the, without there being

03:48.805 --> 04:02.545
written down, what did you and your fellow 
students assume were the guidelines for

03:48.805 --> 04:02.545
classroom behavior, the rules about going to 
class? Well, of course we wore uniforms, and they

04:03.026 --> 04:09.836
were clean. One thing about this college, they had 
that college law, and there was no excuse for you to

04:11.258 --> 04:17.968
go around dirty. And the students wouldn't let you 
be dirty. They'd make you take a shower. If you

04:25.051 --> 04:28.755
didn't, they'd see that you had a shower.

04:31.999 --> 04:37.085
The classrooms in those days, the students were 
timely. They were respectful. They were

04:41.510 --> 04:42.552
courteous. They were polite. And for the most 
part, they were very attentive.

04:53.025 --> 05:03.861
Any crowd that you'd get into, every once in a while 
you'd get somebody that was either combative or a

04:53.025 --> 05:03.861
little out of line, but that was the exception. Do 
you remember any kind of pranks or tricks or good

05:03.881 --> 05:09.349
bull happening in a classroom?

05:11.833 --> 05:14.196
Well, I'm sure it happened all the time.

05:19.002 --> 05:22.226
anybody ever put anything under the lectern? 
Well, I remember they uh, what did they do? They uh,

05:28.073 --> 05:32.518
Mr. uh, Dr. uh, D.B. Colford.

05:35.962 --> 05:43.892
Uh, somebody had gone in there and said, D.B. 
Colford. D.B. stands for Dusty Butt. I wrote that

05:49.090 --> 05:52.073
on the board. What was his reaction? He was the 
cutest thing in the world. He turned and said, I may

05:56.877 --> 06:10.590
be a dusty bug, but I'm not a dusty brain like 
somebody who wrote this on his blackboard. Very

06:10.610 --> 06:11.150
good. He was so good. And there were other things 
like that, but right now, you know, it's just...

06:13.392 --> 06:18.557
All right, let's go to the run-through, Mom. Let's 
go to the dormitories then. Can you remember some

06:21.534 --> 06:26.842
good bowl- Yeah, a lot of good bowl dormitories. 
Share some of that. Well, I was in C Company and we

06:27.864 --> 06:37.980
had a sophomore who was giving us hell all the time 
named Ruben Caperton, best little boy in the

06:27.864 --> 06:37.980
world. He was from Sterling City, a year ahead of 
me. He was living up on the I guess it was the second

06:44.035 --> 06:46.259
floor of Goodman Hall. You know, to get to the first 
floor of Goodman Hall, you had to go up about five

06:46.399 --> 06:52.849
steps. And somebody knew where an old cow was. And 
we got together, and Reuben had gone somewhere. He

07:01.022 --> 07:07.512
was gonna be gone for about an hour or two. And 
somebody said, come on, we gotta go get this cow.

07:13.229 --> 07:15.451
You know, I wasn't a stranger to cows. We had cows 
when I was growing up pretty much. I said, OK, what

07:18.675 --> 07:20.536
are we going to do with that cow? And they wouldn't 
tell us. OK, we'll go get the cow. So we went. I guess

07:25.481 --> 07:29.486
somewhere around the dairy, we got this cow. It was 
a dorsal cow. It was not much problem. It had horns.

07:35.512 --> 07:36.573
We got that cow. And we got him up to the second 
floor. We got him into that room. And we dressed the

07:46.306 --> 07:48.729
head of that cow up. We tied a lot of old Rubens 
underwear around it, all that damn stuff. And we

07:54.415 --> 08:02.124
all hid up there around

07:54.415 --> 08:02.124
the corner from his room. He came in, and here he 
was. And he opened that door, and you could hear him

08:02.784 --> 08:09.612
scream and holler from all over the country. And of 
course, after the good bull went off, we had to get

08:10.739 --> 08:15.306
the damn cow back down to the shed. We had a hell of a 
lot of trouble getting it down, and we did. And then

08:20.734 --> 08:27.405
there was the old trick, you know, of the ketchup.

08:28.426 --> 08:33.734
There's an old guy, I guess he worked for the 
college, living on F&D Road. He had a good looking

08:33.755 --> 08:37.320
daughter.

08:38.870 --> 08:56.094
The trick was, the thing was,

08:38.870 --> 08:56.094
well, this gal, she was having a lot of good sex. You 
didn't go see her. You didn't go see her. This was

08:57.036 --> 08:57.837
the whole thing. They'd pull over there. They 
would knock on the door. They'd get close to it.

09:01.322 --> 09:02.103
Someone would say, hey, you better run. Here comes 
Mr. So-and-so. This old man would run. Here this

09:04.206 --> 09:05.147
other guy was that was set up. Somebody shot a gun 
somewhere nearby. This guy fell. And he had a

09:12.055 --> 09:14.679
little thing to catch him. And he spread that 
ketchup all over his chest. And he went back like

09:17.002 --> 09:18.724
that. And then they brought the guy up that was set 
up to look. Well, Haskell's been killed.

09:26.896 --> 09:30.180
And that went on a lot of times, that kind of stuff. 
What about water in the dormitory? A lot of

09:32.664 --> 09:34.126
flooding out. A lot of flooding out. Normally, who 
was the most likely victim of the flooding?

09:40.296 --> 09:41.898
Juniors and seniors. Why? What did they do? Well, 
they did something back in their younger, earlier

09:43.922 --> 09:48.088
days. For example, I got flooded out my senior 
year. So this was a delayed... It was a delayed

09:54.738 --> 09:55.920
thing. Of a delayed payment. Yeah. Now, we had a... 
Darcy and... And Jack Henderson had a running feud

10:04.392 --> 10:11.102
with some people over at the Kenmore Fair. And it 
started out with red ants. They said, now, y'all

10:17.592 --> 10:26.526
got to get us about five fruit jars full of red ants. 
So we hustled five or six fruit jars. and we stole

10:31.325 --> 10:38.371
some honey and syrup out of the mess hall. We didn't 
have any fire ants in those days, you know, but we

10:38.391 --> 11:00.690
went around and found these big red fire ant 
things, and we'd pour some of that ketchup or that

10:38.391 --> 11:00.690
honey around them, or stick that honey down in 
those jars, and those damn things, they loved the

10:38.391 --> 11:00.690
little red ants, and we'd put the cap on a bunch of 
holes in them. and would collect about five or six

11:01.379 --> 11:11.530
of those things and take over and put in the room 
with these boys over there in the Kemp Water Fair.

11:12.391 --> 11:13.232
Take the lids off? Take the lids off and let them, 
then the, those boys over there, they were pretty

11:13.252 --> 11:25.125
good at chemistry. And they mixed up a solution of 
what they call skatole. I don't know whether you

11:31.514 --> 11:34.157
know what that is. It's a concentrated shit. And 
they came over to Jack and Dorsey's room and they

11:37.541 --> 11:47.553
put that skatole down in the beds, you know, iron 
and they had open ends. They put that stuff down in

11:47.574 --> 11:53.661
there and they put it in the most god awful places. 
Can you recall any of those tricks or pranks which

11:54.586 --> 12:10.430
in fact harmed

11:54.586 --> 12:10.430
anybody? I don't

12:10.450 --> 12:21.387
know anybody ever

12:10.450 --> 12:21.387
getting hurt. Do you know of university property 
being damaged very much? I wasn't in glasses

12:27.713 --> 12:29.115
broken. We went over to Ross Hall and took toe sacks 
and collected the bats and chimney sweeps. Nobody

12:37.808 --> 12:39.290
heard from that. We put those bats and chimney 
sweeps in one of those rooms. And by and large, the

12:43.076 --> 12:50.106
people that deserve to have a trick played on them 
deserve it. Yeah. And vice versa. And then they got

12:51.392 --> 12:52.393
it back. I mean, it was give and take. Now, the 
drownouts. How did the water get there? Well, we

13:00.740 --> 13:05.224
all had wastebaskets about this big. And we had a 
lot of toilet paper. What we'd do is make up a

13:09.307 --> 13:15.953
solution of water and toilet paper all squashed 
together. A combination of wet paper and water.

13:20.530 --> 13:31.827
And, for example, Dorsey and Jack had this fellow 
named Divine that came to visit, like the man who

13:20.530 --> 13:31.827
came to dinner. He came to visit in their room, and 
he was on the top floor, top bunk. And he stayed

13:39.979 --> 13:41.481
about two months. He didn't have a job. He didn't 
have anything to eat. He was marching the mess hall

13:44.786 --> 13:47.190
just like all the students. He wasn't wearing 
khakis and khaki shirts. And Darcy and Jack just

13:50.922 --> 13:53.665
got tired of him. You know, they said, y'all got to

13:53.685 --> 13:58.571
float him out. Just float him out tonight. We're 
not going to be there. He'll be asleep. You just

14:00.533 --> 14:01.474
float him out. So we mixed up about two wastebanks 
full of water and told them to leave. And Bill ended

14:13.447 --> 14:15.730
it. And we had a kid over there. He slipped in and he 
was asleep. I hit him right on the head with that

14:17.251 --> 14:18.873
bucket of water. And Bill... Hammocks hit him 
right down here. And of course he ran and he flushed

14:24.927 --> 14:35.020
and flurried around there for a while and sure 
enough in two or three days he checked out and left.

14:36.281 --> 14:40.286
What about, did y'all ever make, we used to call 
them babble bombs. I never did make a babble bomb. I

14:43.410 --> 14:47.035
put firecrackers in toilet paper, yeah. Yeah, 
that was done around a lot, but I never did do that.

14:51.025 --> 14:52.206
But it was done. Right. Now, where did you and your 
buddies go on a Saturday night after the movie for a

14:53.268 --> 15:00.096
good time? Hardlickers. Hardlickers. We walked 
to Hardlickers. Okay. This was normally all mail.

15:08.367 --> 15:08.907
All mail. And what did you all do there? Well, those 
of us who could buy beer would buy Southern Select

15:11.030 --> 15:15.756
or grand prize beer. Now what, you've said those 
who could. Yeah. What did Mr. Hurdlek, did he

15:22.430 --> 15:25.033
check? From time to time he would check. Ages? 
Yeah, ages, yeah. Did anybody get drunk? Yeah,

15:33.642 --> 15:36.386
yeah, yeah, yeah, there was some time. Then you 
always have to help them get back, help them get

15:36.606 --> 15:42.132
back. That was the number one place to go, more or 
less, off campus. Except the movie house. And that

15:50.798 --> 15:53.782
was by and large, almost everybody in there was 
medieval. Yeah. Were there any people in there

15:54.483 --> 15:56.907
except Aggie? On the weekends, not very many. A few 
of the Bohemians around would come. Those that did

16:03.677 --> 16:06.120
a lot of beer drinking would come in. But on 
weekends, there were gals. that would come in here

16:08.993 --> 16:25.768
for the dances, like the sophomore ball, or the 
junior ball, or the senior ball, or the infantry

16:08.993 --> 16:25.768
ball, or the artillery ball, and after the, after 
the, all the social functions there, they'd end up

16:08.993 --> 16:25.768
out, and they had a jukebox. And they had a little 
dance floor. Uh, would there, were there ever any

16:29.051 --> 16:31.953
fights? Uh, there were some fights, But not as many 
as you think. And where could you buy whiskey and so

16:42.308 --> 16:47.857
forth? You could buy whiskey at what we call Jones 
Bridge. Highway 60. Okay. Go out across the Brazos

16:55.909 --> 16:57.872
River. Y'all called it Jones Bridge. Jones 
Bridge. Because later it would be Whiskey Bridge.

17:01.678 --> 17:03.040
Yeah, yeah. Jones Bridge. Just across the river on 
the north? On the right. Okay. Okay. You go across

17:07.060 --> 17:16.011
the river, and on the right, they had that old 
bridge there, old iron bridge. Just as soon as you

17:17.132 --> 17:25.482
got across that old iron bridge, back on the right 
was Mr. Dunn had a bootlegger store. Did they check

17:25.502 --> 17:28.025
carefully on ages? No, they didn't care. And it was 
legal to sell whiskey in that county? Yes, it was

17:33.432 --> 17:34.073
legal. This was not bootlegged, it was legal to. 
And normally the whiskey was it drunk straight or

17:36.254 --> 17:42.505
mixed with what? It was mixed usually with 
Coca-Cola. Yeah, Coca-Cola and bourbon was

17:46.291 --> 17:50.498
usually what it was. Then a little later on in my 
senior year it was rum and Coca-Cola and lemon.

17:59.534 --> 18:01.317
But It wasn't, we'd have people go and they'd 
bootleg, you know, they'd say, well, I'll bring

18:02.107 --> 18:10.440
you a bottle of so-and-so, but I charge you 50 
cents. Excuse me, I gotta go. Okay.

18:16.289 --> 18:24.181
Talking about alcohol, did a student bring 
whiskey, a bottle of whiskey back to the dorm, put

18:16.289 --> 18:24.181
it in his room? We didn't keep whiskey around in our 
dorm rooms, really. What was the official policy

18:30.777 --> 18:33.500
if anybody did? I think it was against the rules to 
have any alcoholic beverage in your dorm room, and

18:33.520 --> 18:43.591
so we made a point not to have it around. Matter of 
fact, my friend Billy Merrill from Greenville was

18:43.651 --> 18:55.385
one of the few people that had a car down here in the 
early days, and what little booze we had, we kept it

18:43.651 --> 18:55.385
locked up in the trunk of his car. We didn't display 
any Y'all went to

18:59.414 --> 19:04.840
the clay pits? Yes. No, no, no. The clay pits was 
something new to me when I came back here. Oh,

19:11.808 --> 19:12.669
that's after the war. That's after the war. Yes. So 
there was... The clay pits was not around in my era.

19:20.577 --> 19:29.387
So there was no place that y'all had just to kind of 
go out in peace and quiet and talk or... Well, we

19:29.738 --> 19:39.109
used to do a lot of walking and playing around at 
what we called the Fish Lake. I'll tell you where it

19:40.291 --> 19:41.572
was. It was out around Eastwood. They had a couple 
of ponds over there, one of them they drained. But

19:47.519 --> 19:52.405
we used to go over there Sunday morning after we 
went to Sunday school. We'd go over there, three or

19:52.807 --> 20:00.114
four of us, and we would strip down to our birthday 
suit and swim in those lakes over there. The

20:02.776 --> 20:04.858
diversity of the student body. Almost all the 
students had a nickname? Most of them had

20:10.603 --> 20:13.346
nicknames, yeah. Most of them had nicknames they 
brought in from high school. But then others got

20:17.349 --> 20:20.552
nicknames after they got here. There were some 
Hispanic students here when you were here. Yes.

20:25.536 --> 20:29.581
Did any of them have Hispanic nicknames? Yes.

20:33.105 --> 20:34.707
Were they treated as equals? Oh, yes. We had boys 
from Mexico and Puerto Rico and Honduras and my

20:36.369 --> 20:50.286
company, Mexico City, and they were treated just 
like everybody else. What about Jewish? Yes, we

20:52.074 --> 20:53.716
had Jewish. And they were treated just as equal. 
Did they ever have nicknames? Yes. Was anybody

20:58.383 --> 20:59.645
called Jew Boy? No. Oh. Two or three have told me 
they were, but they did not consider to put them.

21:05.853 --> 21:06.174
No. Mervyn Hoffman was in my company. And Mervyn 
was always Mervyn. We had, we didn't have a lot of

21:16.895 --> 21:40.233
Jewish boys, but the Jewish boys were treated as 
what was in the manual, not manual, but Manny

21:16.895 --> 21:40.233
Rosenthal, who gave the Rosenthal, was editor of 
our battalion. We called him Manny. Mike Hyken

21:42.646 --> 21:49.436
from Houston, who was a PR man in Houston. We just 
called him Mike.

21:53.783 --> 21:56.287
Aaron Rich from San Antonio was Aaron.

22:00.373 --> 22:05.341
The

22:00.373 --> 22:05.341
other San Antonio boys. But the Jewish boys were 
not large in number, but they were very well

22:05.801 --> 22:11.590
accepted. Generalize, if you can, generalize 
about the student body. Where did they come from

22:18.104 --> 22:21.287
then? Country, towns, big cities, or what? The 
student body in those days, my generation, came

22:24.310 --> 22:37.223
from all over Texas, primarily the small

22:24.310 --> 22:37.223
towns. They were not necessarily from the big 
towns, but they were from just widespread. Rich or

22:45.466 --> 22:46.147
poor? Rich and poor. Rich and poor. Did it matter? 
It didn't matter. It didn't matter. What did

22:54.897 --> 23:00.903
matter then for this kind of general acceptance of 
everybody? What was the key to that? Well,

23:02.665 --> 23:06.369
leadership. Leadership. The young men who could 
command,

23:08.472 --> 23:21.525
who could inspire,

23:08.472 --> 23:21.525
they were here, you know. You could just find them. 
Tom Gillis, Tom Ritchie,

23:25.108 --> 23:31.334
men that were true leaders. You know if you're a 
good leader in high school, Or junior high, you're

23:34.763 --> 23:41.835
a good leader in high school, you're a good leader 
in college, you're a good leader in life. And those

23:41.855 --> 23:44.039
people, we had plenty of them. Even though we had a 
lot of students from small towns. The students

23:51.232 --> 23:55.639
were the cream of the crop in Texas colleges. I 
asked this question of Sam Walton one time. As you

24:00.194 --> 24:11.610
look back, did many of your classmates surprise 
you by the capability you thought they had and what

24:00.194 --> 24:11.610
they did with that capability? Did many fail? 
You're saying some did? No, no, I'm listening to

24:16.777 --> 24:18.660
you. No, I was wondering. No, what I'm saying is a 
leader is a leader in Jody. The leaders we had in our

24:23.987 --> 24:29.695
class were known to be leaders in the war. went on to 
be leaders professionally or in business. That's

24:34.890 --> 24:36.032
what I was expecting. And I'll tell you this, I 
don't know of any, but I guess there were some who

24:36.052 --> 24:48.090
did fail, but for other reasons, alcohol or 
marriage or something else. But by and large, the

24:48.310 --> 24:59.547
boys that were the leaders in the Corps, the cadet 
colonels and the majors and the outfitmen,

25:00.067 --> 25:01.409
company commanders. They were leaders, and 
they're still leaders. Alright, let's see.

25:06.999 --> 25:08.962
Smoking was comparatively common? Smoking was 
something, as a non-smoker, for me at that time, I

25:11.366 --> 25:21.123
didn't pay any attention to smoking, really. But 
I'm sure My roommate, Whit Stockton, was a smoker,

25:23.084 --> 25:32.419
because I remember him carrying those green Lucky 
Strikes around with him. But, you know, I don't

25:32.439 --> 25:37.987
think we had too many smokers in those days. Where 
could they and could they not smoke? They could

25:40.551 --> 25:43.035
smoke anywhere they wanted to, except in class. 
They couldn't smoke in class. Or the dining hall.

25:47.362 --> 25:50.627
They couldn't smoke in the dining hall, but they 
could smoke in their rooms. Other tobacco, did

25:51.755 --> 25:54.260
anybody chew? Oh, yes. Yes, there were a lot of 
people who chewed tobacco. Snuff? They'd snuff

26:02.455 --> 26:04.439
and roll their own. They had these little, what do 
you call them, ready rolls. And they had them in

26:12.713 --> 26:17.821
their dorm rooms, and they'd say, hey, come over 
here, I want you to help me make a bunch of

26:12.713 --> 26:17.821
cigarettes. And we'd get in there and get 
everything set up where they'd put that tobacco,

26:18.181 --> 26:25.833
put those little cigarette papers in there and 
start rolling. What did y'all know about

26:26.694 --> 26:28.557
marijuana then? Didn't know one thing about 
marijuana. Had you heard the word? Not that I know

26:31.862 --> 26:33.184
of. Cocaine, of course, no. No, I don't... I don't 
remember. The worst thing about like that that we

26:39.350 --> 26:53.047
saw was every once in a while we'd have an epileptic 
situation and some kids would have an epileptic

26:39.350 --> 26:53.047
fit. Well for us that was like being having a drug 
attack because we didn't understand it. And we had

26:59.574 --> 27:04.320
a few kids that we came to know as being epileptic. 
And you know, we thought that was something

27:08.282 --> 27:10.664
terrible. We didn't understand that it was a 
medical problem. Getting dates. Where did the

27:17.251 --> 27:18.653
young man get a date? Well, most of the dates were 
gotten by being brought in from home town. And

27:25.480 --> 27:30.645
there wasn't any place to put them because there 
wasn't enough motels in this area. We'd walk

27:30.980 --> 27:43.371
around the campus, the perimeter of the campus, 
and knock on doors and talk to some faculty

27:30.980 --> 27:43.371
member's wife and say, can you keep my girlfriend 
for next Saturday? And that's the way we found the

27:43.391 --> 27:45.914
department. Would there be even an offer to pay 
that faculty member? Oh, yes, that was the one. Did

27:53.380 --> 27:54.742
they normally accept it? Yes, they did accept it. 
It was, yes, you paid so much it was very minimal.

28:00.207 --> 28:02.189
Did you have some dates like that? Yes. And came 
here on the train? Came down here on the train or in a

28:05.431 --> 28:08.534
car with somebody. From where? Well, one that I had 
come down came from Greenville in a private car

28:09.615 --> 28:15.960
with other girls. And another one I had came from 
TSCW on the bus. How did you meet her? The one that

28:23.907 --> 28:30.012
came from TSCW was my cousin by marriage, Harriet 
Jarrett. And she lived in Lubbock, but she went to

28:30.616 --> 28:33.539
TSCW. She had me up then two or three times. I had her 
down here for one day or something. And we, there

28:39.464 --> 28:45.669
were three or four of those girls in the same group, 
and I got them a room in J.D. Pruitt's over. Now, is

28:49.213 --> 28:59.762
the rumor, the old legend correct that sometimes 
an Aggie wrote a blind date letter to a test seat

29:00.670 --> 29:02.994
using the same box number that he had? Yeah, yeah, 
that was so. Did the Tassie's, before the war, did

29:05.217 --> 29:09.063
they come down here as a group? They came down here 
in buses. For a certain weekend? Yeah. Okay. Yeah,

29:13.129 --> 29:14.671
for different weekends. Did that have a name or 
anything? That weekend? No, because it depended

29:19.839 --> 29:23.224
on what the big occasion was here. For example, if 
it was a senior ring dance, then the seniors would

29:29.746 --> 29:32.709
have to come down in a bus. And they would stay as 
many as they could in the old Aggieland Inn. And

29:38.615 --> 29:43.759
they couldn't accommodate them there while 
they'd just stay at homes and so forth. Infantry

29:43.820 --> 29:52.268
ball would be another occasion that gals from TSCW 
would come on invitation from the boys in the same

29:43.820 --> 29:52.268
infantry. Now big social occasions, but cotton 
ball? Cotton ball. The ring dance. Senior ring

30:00.684 --> 30:01.825
dance. What else? Freshman, sophomore, junior, 
senior dances. Oh, okay. Then there was the

30:10.417 --> 30:22.293
infantry ball, the field artillery ball, the 
coastal artillery ball, the cavalry ball, the

30:10.417 --> 30:22.293
signet, the chem warfare and signal corps. See, 
all of those had balls. Normally held in? In

30:26.638 --> 30:27.640
Subusa. Subusa. Do you remember some of the great 
musical organizations? Oh, yes. Russ Morgan,

30:33.578 --> 30:43.590
Duke Ellington, Boyd Rayburn, the All Girl 
Orchestra, what was it? Phil Spitalny? No, the All

30:45.432 --> 30:49.597
Girl was something else. I can't call it now, but 
she brought her All Girl Orchestra. I can't come up

30:56.925 --> 30:58.427
with it. I

30:58.660 --> 31:08.708
had a program somewhere

30:58.660 --> 31:08.708
here. Yeah, here it is. Somebody gave this to me and 
the others not too long ago. Spencer Baines, class

31:14.814 --> 31:23.661
of 42, A&M

31:14.814 --> 31:23.661
Junior Bank Group. Oh, my goodness. That's what 
they looked like. Yeah, yeah. And at every ball,

31:28.850 --> 31:30.072
It's Lou Brees. Lou Brees. B-R-E-E-S-E. Yeah, Lou 
Brees. Class officer, J.B. Hervey, historian.

31:37.862 --> 31:39.745
Yeah, there's all of them. They're in the 
committee. Now, at one of these, if it was the

31:41.808 --> 31:49.578
junior, were members of the other classes 
allowed, or was this for juniors only? No,

31:50.039 --> 31:58.030
it was primarily for juniors only. but a certain 
number of the sophomores that were leaders came

31:58.803 --> 32:02.755
too.
