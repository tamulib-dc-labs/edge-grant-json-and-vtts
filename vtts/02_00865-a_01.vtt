WEBVTT

00:01.432 --> 00:04.315
This is a test.

00:11.703 --> 00:13.325
You lived here after the mine shut down? Oh yeah.

00:21.894 --> 00:25.037
They run into that hole and they grind themselves 
in. Put that a little deeper then. Two men drove

00:30.085 --> 00:32.368
their Model T into the mine shaft? Yeah. Do you 
remember about what year that was? No, I can't tell

00:34.410 --> 00:36.573
you exactly. What, 1920s?

00:42.000 --> 00:42.360
No. They

00:42.400 --> 00:58.120
had a tipple over there. They had a tipple. How did 
that tipple work? Exactly. Well, they're made out

01:01.122 --> 01:05.887
of 12 by 12 straight up. And there's four, six of 
them. And then the rest of them. Six 4 by 12s? Huh?

01:11.612 --> 01:12.573
Six 4 by 12s? 12 by 12s. 12 by 12s. Okay. And this was 
an engine, you could say. Was it a steam engine?

01:21.943 --> 01:22.023
Huh? A steam engine? A steam engine, yeah. Where 
was the boiler? Do you remember that? The boiler?

01:31.156 --> 01:36.521
They had a sawmill that belonged to the man who 
owned the coal mine, the coal mine owners. They had

01:36.541 --> 01:37.462
a sawmill. Why would they have a sawmill? Well, to 
make some timber for the coal mines. There used to

01:42.886 --> 01:44.087
be a lot of timber. Cut their shore. Did they use a 
steam engine again for that? Okay, now what was the

01:51.814 --> 01:53.676
name of this mine site? It's not the Black Diamond 
Mine. No. What was the Spanish name? The Black

01:57.579 --> 02:00.842
Diamond is the name they gave the coal mines. Of 
vogels. Of vogels, okay. But what did the Spanish

02:04.713 --> 02:06.714
people call this mine? This one? Yeah. This other 
one, across here? Right. La recluta, we call in

02:10.678 --> 02:15.662
Spanish recluta, but that's the name of the people 
there. La recluta? Recluta. Recluta. Everybody

02:18.485 --> 02:19.886
know la recluta. La recluta. That would be...

02:21.267 --> 02:28.493
Jose Mireles. Oh, Jose Mireles? Yeah. Yeah, over 
at the old Vogel mine, that's where he was trapped.

02:33.755 --> 02:34.455
Yeah, that's the one. See, that was the one, two, 
that was the third coal mine. No, that was the

02:39.059 --> 02:40.620
fourth coal mine. This was the third coal mine 
right here. Okay, what we've been calling the

02:43.062 --> 02:50.349
Black Diamond Mine is La Recluta, and it was the 
third coal mine that the Vogels built, right?

02:50.369 --> 02:50.489
Yeah. The coal mines was over there. This is the 
third coal mine they built. And then there's

02:54.652 --> 03:00.057
another coal mine back in, I think, 1912. It got 
full of water. Okay. It caught some men down there.

03:05.003 --> 03:06.144
1913 is when it was. 1913, that's right. It caught 
seven men and a mule. Yeah. We'll be over there in

03:10.671 --> 03:11.812
just a minute. Now, Willinghampton used to live 
right there. He used to live right along there.

03:19.002 --> 03:21.165
There was cutting wood from Mr. Nowak. Mr. Nowak? 
Mm-hmm. And early in the morning, they run in

03:23.328 --> 03:26.092
there. With that Model T, right? Mm-hmm. How did 
they get that Model T out? With the winch? Yeah.

03:36.290 --> 03:37.632
What do you remember about the mines? What sticks 
out in your mind most about the mines? What sticks

03:40.958 --> 03:43.302
out in your mind most about the mines?

03:47.168 --> 03:50.154
All I can remember is that I worked hard to it. How 
old were you when you first went down?

04:00.078 --> 04:02.682
I was about eight years old. You started at the 
brickyard when you were eight? And then you moved

04:05.566 --> 04:06.888
into the mines? No, I was working there in the coal 
mine. I want to show you, if we go out there, I'll

04:10.234 --> 04:16.163
show you where the brick kiln was, and that's where 
the mines covered up. You know how long the lake

04:16.183 --> 04:19.087
tank was over there? Right, that clay pit, right? 
Yeah, that's why I showed you them pictures a while

04:20.109 --> 04:22.512
ago. Right, yeah. Well, they used to get the dirt 
out into the big shade, you know? Right. And they

04:29.457 --> 04:31.158
had to get dry. They made the bricks out of dry dirt. 
Right. Dry clay, right? Yeah. Well, you were eight

04:36.243 --> 04:39.966
years old when you went down into the mine? Yeah. 
Did your parents have to sign a paper? No. They used

04:44.010 --> 04:45.311
to not do that. They used to not do that? Yeah. Well, 
what year would that have been if you were eight

04:47.112 --> 04:49.274
years old? A little bit of trouble about that big. 
You know what I do? Just beat it over there in the

04:52.797 --> 04:55.099
coal mine. That's the company. But I got a little 
bigger than he. They got me picking a shovel, and

04:59.275 --> 05:06.745
said a room or entry run like this, and another one 
run like this. And they had a, they run a place like

05:07.265 --> 05:12.812
this for air. See, they run, when you get so far, 
then they stop this thing up, and then you get out to

05:15.416 --> 05:23.646
this one. I see.

05:28.856 --> 05:32.441
So when you were eight years old, you just went down 
to your father. You didn't really work. Well, how

05:33.924 --> 05:36.508
old were you when you started? About 12 years old.

05:41.195 --> 05:44.300
About how many carloads a day could you by yourself 
fill up? Oh, really? Yeah. Well, what year were you

05:52.668 --> 05:55.331
born? Do you remember that? 1890. 1890. 1890, I was 
born in La Toscosa County. That's outside of San

06:01.780 --> 06:03.582
Antonio. Coal mines are there. I see. Outside of 
San Antonio. So you were down in the mines in 1898.

06:12.073 --> 06:16.719
And when you became 12 years old, you started 
digging yourself. How long did you... I didn't

06:19.863 --> 06:21.004
work there. I didn't work, you know, I just went 
down to company with my father. I am going to show

06:25.255 --> 06:28.839
you when we got out right back of where them cattle 
was at. Right. That was the first coal mine that my

06:30.421 --> 06:35.166
father came to work. Because I don't remember 
because I was crawling then. Right, right. I see.

06:39.651 --> 06:42.835
Well, when, did you ever work the mine actually 
yourself? Did you go down and dig? Yeah. When did

06:44.377 --> 06:47.160
you start that and where?

06:50.363 --> 06:57.129
I guess I was about 18 years

06:50.363 --> 06:57.129
old. Which mine did you start at? Well, we lived at 
Vogel's coal mine most of the time. I worked on the

07:03.835 --> 07:07.299
Texas coal company, but I didn't work no time 
there. A few months. Well, when you were working at

07:09.240 --> 07:14.926
the Vogel mine when you were 18, about how many car 
loads a day? Well, I could dig about 60. About six?

07:20.616 --> 07:22.078
About six tons of coal. That's six tons of coal a 
day. And how much would you get paid for that? I

07:27.362 --> 07:28.684
think I was getting 20 cents. 20 cents a car.

07:32.687 --> 07:35.430
Did they pay you every two weeks or every month? 
Every two weeks. Every two weeks? Did you ever get

07:36.551 --> 07:40.955
cash for your pay? Did you go to the commissary and 
order food? Yeah, each one of the coal mines had a

07:44.938 --> 07:47.961
commissary. Were you able to save money? No. I had 
no sense to save money. What did you spend your

07:55.974 --> 07:59.419
money on if you didn't save it? Well, I didn't save 
it because of what little work, you know, what

07:59.860 --> 08:07.051
little work I'd done. Well, I let my mother have, 
buy groceries, things like that, clothes, things

08:07.131 --> 08:13.862
like that. Until I married, then I began to work 
hard by myself. And once you were, when were you

08:17.000 --> 08:18.662
married? How old were you? I married in 1914. 1914. 
And then how many coal cars a day did you? About the

08:25.631 --> 08:26.332
same. About the same? Yeah, about the same. But 
most of the time, then after that, after marriage,

08:27.894 --> 08:34.903
I worked for a company, you know, a mule driver. So 
you came out of the mines and worked? On top or? No.

08:40.035 --> 08:41.978
Oh, you were a mule driver in the mines. In the 
mines, yeah. Did you get paid differently for

08:42.599 --> 08:44.221
being a? Yeah, $2 and something. I think $2 a day. $2 
a day. So that would have been about $60 a month?

08:52.292 --> 08:52.372
Huh? About $60 a month? Yeah, but we only worked 
five days. Five days, okay. Five days and a half

08:58.721 --> 09:05.991
during the summertime when they was using coal for 
this cotton gins. Mm-hmm. Then it's when we get

09:06.572 --> 09:08.134
more work. But in the wintertime, we didn't get 
very much work to do. Was there any time during the

09:13.489 --> 09:18.835
year that you didn't work at all in the mines? No, I 
didn't work all the time. Steady work that just is

09:21.498 --> 09:26.323
overtime work some seasons of the year when the 
cotton gins. When the cotton gins was working,

09:27.024 --> 09:31.569
we'd get more work at the coal mine. We worked five 
days. Did you ever work six days a week? No. About

09:38.843 --> 09:42.347
how many hours a day would you work down in the coal 
mines? Well, I think about eight hours.

09:48.674 --> 09:50.576
I see. What did you do on the weekends? If you only 
worked five days a week, what did you do on the

09:53.138 --> 09:55.721
weekends? Well, I'd play with the kids, play ball. 
I worked some in Malakoff, Texas, too. In

10:02.689 --> 10:03.890
Malakoff, okay. That was every kind of work. These 
coal mines out here, they're never blasting the

10:07.295 --> 10:11.320
coal out. And it might have cost you this because 
that coal's too hard.

10:20.291 --> 10:32.466
Maybe

10:20.291 --> 10:32.466
we can ask Tomas here, what kind of cooking ware did 
the women use in the mine camps? Oh, well, you just,

10:32.966 --> 10:36.070
everything you can get. Everything, flour, 
tables, bacon. They used tin pots or iron pots? No,

10:44.164 --> 10:47.648
they used, most of it was tin. Tin? Yeah. You found 
some ceramics over there, you say? Just

10:52.373 --> 10:54.775
enamelware, like china. That's where the camp 
used to be. You see, the camp used to be right along

10:57.538 --> 10:59.520
there. Covered all that ridge back there, did it 
not? Huh? Covered this entire ridge, the

11:02.143 --> 11:04.285
crossover ridge. No, we used to live, we used to 
have a house right over there. Right just beyond

11:09.736 --> 11:13.800
those two trees, right? But then this place didn't 
look like it, no. Not what it was before. You see,

11:19.986 --> 11:21.628
there was no wood in there. All that place in there, 
there was no wood. It's all cleared out. Just two

11:24.771 --> 11:26.293
trees, I don't know. How long ago was that? Oh, it 
was 19... The last time I worked for this company,

11:30.937 --> 11:33.580
1925. And where did you go after that? I went to 
Malakoff. In 1925, I went to Garrison, Texas.

11:41.736 --> 11:42.437
Garrison? Garrison. Garrison. Galveston or 
Garrison? No, Garrison. Garrison. But I don't

11:47.381 --> 11:50.404
have a voice for Nacogdoches, but... Right. And 
then you came back. When did you come back to

11:53.406 --> 11:55.047
Rockland? Then I came back in 1930. And what did you 
do then? Then I went to work at the coal... See,

11:59.912 --> 12:03.955
1930? No, I worked on the railroad. I worked about 
two months, maybe three months. And then I went to

12:11.863 --> 12:13.224
picking cotton. And then from there, after cotton 
was all picked out, I went to cutting wood. Did you

12:22.195 --> 12:23.617
ever go back to coal mining? No, there was no more 
coal mining then. After 1925? No, no, after 19...

12:32.892 --> 12:37.619
34, 35 I think was the most coal mines. Well, in the 
1930s, you didn't work in the coal mines. Yeah. You

12:40.323 --> 12:40.724
did. When you came back from Garrison. When I came 
back to Garrison, I came back to this same place

12:44.169 --> 12:47.234
here. And I stayed here about five or six months. 
And then I went back to Malacca. And I stayed in

12:53.203 --> 12:55.987
Malacca until 31, I think. And then you came back. 
And then came back, the coal mines was all gone. I

13:00.173 --> 13:01.515
went to work for a railroad company. In 1931, that 
is. Yeah. I see.

13:11.238 --> 13:12.980
Entry, that's main. Then they got places that 
comes out this way, they call them rooms. Yeah.

13:18.767 --> 13:19.067
Fingers. Yeah. And then another place comes in 
this way, and then here's where you get your air

13:19.948 --> 13:28.137
ventilator. Did you stope it? Huh? Was it stoping? 
How'd you mine it? With a stoke? With a pick. With a

13:36.722 --> 13:37.162
pick? Pick and a shovel. You didn't use a drill? 
Hammer? No. You didn't have steel drills? No, this

13:43.089 --> 13:46.914
is all the coal around here is lignite. Yeah, it's 
real soft. Soft, yeah. But still, it's hard. Most

13:52.981 --> 13:58.728
of the coal that you can dig is about ten cars a day. 
How much was in a car? One ton. One ton?

14:07.190 --> 14:09.538
Don't turn a call for 20 cents.
