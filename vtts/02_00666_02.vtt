WEBVTT

00:02.309 --> 00:11.399
And so we're running on, at the moment, we're 
running on a pretty constant year to year with not

00:02.309 --> 00:11.399
only the increases that would keep up to the 
consumer price index or something. We are

00:11.419 --> 00:12.019
growing. The Woods Hole Oceanographic 
Institution has actually shrunk a slight amount

00:12.700 --> 00:16.825
in the last three years. We haven't grown at all in 
terms of the number of people we have working here

00:17.345 --> 00:26.895
or in terms of the dollars we have when we put them 
into non-inflated terms. In other words, that

00:26.915 --> 00:30.159
you're suffering from the process of inflation 
like everybody else. I didn't say we were

00:30.179 --> 00:31.140
suffering. I said we weren't growing.

00:35.114 --> 00:35.895
It could be suffering. I didn't say that, though. 
You're assuming something there. You're

00:39.121 --> 00:42.948
assuming that vigor is better and that to live is to 
grow. And it may be true. I'm not saying that.

00:46.233 --> 00:47.215
That's a separate question. I'm just saying that 
our funds have not grown. in real terms, and the

00:52.495 --> 00:54.758
institution has slightly increased. That may be 
good. Maybe it's time to retrench a little bit

00:55.479 --> 00:58.644
occasionally. Maybe the best thing that could 
happen for any kind of organization is to pause in a

00:58.724 --> 01:04.432
while, and then grow, and then pause, and then 
grow. During the pause period, you were able to

01:04.452 --> 01:11.702
retrench and do things you may not do in the hectic 
periods of tumultuous growth. Does it seem to you,

01:13.445 --> 01:22.317
as an insider, that the so-called glory days of 
oceanography may be ending in terms of funding? I

01:23.866 --> 01:31.917
don't know what you mean by glory days, but I'll 
assume that you mean periods in which there were

01:23.866 --> 01:31.917
real increases in budget year after year. No, it 
could easily happen again. Oceanography is a

01:35.461 --> 01:39.907
pretty sexy subject, and if it's packaged right, 
it'll sell. There are people who'd like to see it

01:40.829 --> 01:44.153
grow again, and I expect it will. If there are 
people at Woods Hole who would like to participate

01:44.538 --> 01:50.345
in that growth, then I expect they will because we 
have good people here. They're in a position to

01:50.445 --> 01:55.271
capitalize on any opportunities to get increased 
funds. There seems to be a movement on the national

01:56.412 --> 02:08.767
level to place all of the oceanographic funds or 
all the oceanographic grading institutions

01:56.412 --> 02:08.767
under one central agency, probably in commerce. 
Do you approve of that? No, I don't think it's a good

02:12.061 --> 02:13.144
idea. I think one of the strengths of the American 
system is its plurality, and that if we lose this,

02:13.184 --> 02:24.130
we lose the ability to correct mistakes. And the 
price you pay for plurality is a slight amount of

02:24.565 --> 02:32.874
repetition or duplication. I think in 
oceanography this hasn't been great. And we get

02:35.477 --> 02:41.724
our funds from a host of different agencies and 
segments of the economy. And what we can't do one

02:42.385 --> 02:45.388
way, we often are able to do another way. And it's 
those things we do another way that often in the

02:45.769 --> 02:51.535
long run turn out to be the most important 
scientifically or intellectually. And that's

02:51.575 --> 02:53.357
what really counts, not And having a single agency 
would be bad for the country. I don't think the

02:56.647 --> 02:58.289
United States needs a single anything. We're a big 
country, and we can afford, in most cases, to keep a

02:58.309 --> 03:02.395
pluralistic society. One of the things that 
impresses me about this country, as opposed to

03:02.495 --> 03:10.606
countries which have a centralized planning and 
economy, they suffer greatly from it. Because if

03:10.626 --> 03:16.535
that central organization makes a mistake, you 
don't have very effective ways to redress,

03:10.626 --> 03:16.535
whereas we do. And that makes us stronger.

03:22.345 --> 03:32.864
There also seems to be a trend in oceanography 
since the Mansfield Amendment to go more to

03:22.345 --> 03:32.864
directed or practical research, as it's 
sometimes called, rather than theoretical

03:22.345 --> 03:32.864
research. Is that your impression?

03:39.176 --> 03:41.620
My impression is that, yes, there are those 
pressures. There is a feeling, let's say, in

03:42.072 --> 03:48.720
Congress that they'd like to support science in 
general, not just oceanography that's more

03:42.072 --> 03:48.720
applied. I think, though, if you look at most of 
oceanography over the years, a good percentage of

03:49.481 --> 03:54.888
it is what you might call applied research. It's 
had goals that are fairly well understood, either

03:55.469 --> 04:03.118
by the people who are doing it or by the people who 
are funding it, or both. Sometimes both sides

04:04.019 --> 04:07.463
didn't know what the objective was. We looked at 
our budget here. A few months ago, we were curious.

04:12.265 --> 04:14.827
As this comment had come up, we went through what we 
had. And I've forgotten the number. We had

04:15.728 --> 04:22.636
something like 50% of our work in this institution 
could easily be called applied, we felt, just by

04:15.728 --> 04:22.636
looking at what was going on and what its objective 
would be. And not in all cases would the people

04:23.056 --> 04:27.781
doing the work agree with that description of 
their character, of their work. But we knew from

04:27.801 --> 04:30.945
other factors that there were things going on. 
There were people waiting for the results that

04:30.985 --> 04:35.970
they may not have known about in a few cases. OK. Sea 
Grant, was it a good idea or a bad idea?

04:41.877 --> 04:42.799
It was a good idea. It's got some problems. Its 
major problem today is that it's, I think, is too

04:46.165 --> 04:51.976
narrowly construed in its perspective. And it's a 
good idea in the sense that it complemented what we

04:53.278 --> 04:57.726
already had. And in line with my comments I made a 
little while ago about pluralism, I think it's

04:58.145 --> 05:08.397
good to have another agency who is interested in 
marine or marine-related things that doesn't

04:58.145 --> 05:08.397
overlap with anything else. And it gave us one more 
string to our bow. And for that reason, I feel that

05:10.800 --> 05:16.187
Sea Grant is good, and I'd like to encourage its 
continued growth. It needs to grow a little bit,

05:16.767 --> 05:20.292
though, because it is a little bit narrowly 
conceived at the moment. There also seems to be a

05:21.373 --> 05:25.738
trend for more in-house research of government 
institutions. I don't know that I agree with you

05:27.203 --> 05:30.451
about that. There's a natural trend in any 
organization to keep things as close to your vest

05:30.732 --> 05:35.023
and do it in-house. The federal agencies would 
like to do that. The pendulum swings a little bit,

05:38.527 --> 05:43.211
and maybe the last few years have been 
belt-tightening, and they've done it. But if you

05:43.351 --> 05:47.615
look at the, again, I looked at some numbers last 
year on this. I was quoting some other numbers a

05:47.835 --> 05:49.536
moment ago. Other numbers, I tried to get the 
amount of money used in-house federal

05:49.576 --> 05:56.122
laboratories for ocean research. And I found over 
the same period that private laboratories hadn't

05:56.562 --> 06:04.629
grown, neither had that portion of the federal lab 
research program. I think there's also an

06:05.470 --> 06:08.432
awareness and part of many congressmen that it 
costs more money to maintain a civil servant to do

06:09.053 --> 06:20.471
research than the same amount of research costs 
outside universities because of the nature of the

06:09.053 --> 06:20.471
bureaucracy in the federal government and for 
other reasons. And this is well known by many of our

06:21.372 --> 06:31.568
congressmen, and I think that if the pendulum 
swings too far in the way of in-house research, I

06:21.372 --> 06:31.568
think there will be probably strong steps taken to 
spread it around and decentralize. Again, as part

06:34.558 --> 06:38.582
of this pluralism, we have a federal system of 
laboratories. We have a private system of

06:38.602 --> 06:40.163
laboratories. We have university laboratories. 
We have non-university laboratories. It gives us

06:42.886 --> 06:45.308
ability to do things in a number of ways. And I think 
there are forces that try to keep that pluralism in

06:45.348 --> 06:49.512
effect. And certainly, it's a gut feeling of any 
guy running a federal lab to keep the money in

06:50.553 --> 06:55.938
house. He's going to want to do that. That's human 
nature. But there are forces working against

06:58.160 --> 07:02.044
that, too. Reviewing grant proposals, are you 
happy with the review system of grant proposals?

07:08.260 --> 07:08.861
Generally, yes. And you prefer, in effect, peer 
review? I thought you meant peer review, yes. I

07:16.676 --> 07:20.884
think the system generally has slight flaws, but 
generally I like it. Yes, I think it's a good

07:20.944 --> 07:22.547
system. I realize we were working here, though, on 
a system where we don't all, again, this

07:23.017 --> 07:33.489
pluralism, only about half our grants and 
contracts in this institution go through the peer

07:23.017 --> 07:33.489
review system, and the other half don't. But I'd 
like to have that system. I think keeping it and

07:35.511 --> 07:40.938
keeping it healthy is an important component of 
our overall way of doing research. ONR doesn't use

07:40.958 --> 07:42.720
a peer review system. IRDA doesn't use a peer 
review system. 15 or more percent of the money we

07:45.697 --> 07:53.213
have for research in this institution comes from 
non-federal sources, and that's philanthropy

07:45.697 --> 07:53.213
and foundations and things. They don't use a peer 
review system. But I think the peer review system

07:56.780 --> 08:00.187
is important, and I think it ought to be 
maintained. I admire the NSF system of doing it. I

08:02.943 --> 08:10.978
think, except I realize there are cases where it 
breaks down and somebody, because he has the right

08:02.943 --> 08:10.978
name or the wrong name, does or doesn't get funded 
and so forth like that. And those little things do

08:11.018 --> 08:12.140
happen. But overall, I think 90% of the time, it's a 
very effective system.

08:18.412 --> 08:18.793
Very good. Do you anticipate working for a federal 
foundation or a federal agency in the future?

08:28.137 --> 08:29.859
If I did, I would have done it by now, I think. I've 
had lots of job offers frequently. I'm not opposed

08:36.608 --> 08:43.357
to doing it, but I've never found one where I felt it 
would be something I really would like doing. But I

08:44.178 --> 08:46.561
have no answer to your question. Would I think it 
should be part of my training? Not necessarily. I

08:50.767 --> 08:52.609
know a number of people who've gone and done it. 
more effective because they know their way around

08:53.838 --> 09:17.145
washington but there's no more other ways of 
learning about management

08:53.838 --> 09:17.145
in effect on the job training then that's one of 
them okay i can read about it too okay well you can go

08:53.838 --> 09:17.145
to school you can go to harvard business school 
there's all kinds of ways no there's all kinds not

08:53.838 --> 09:17.145
serious all kinds of ways to learn to be a manager 
and i think it's good we have a mix i i I don't know why

09:17.446 --> 09:21.834
I'm getting this lecture on pluralism this 
afternoon, but I think there is important. I think

09:21.854 --> 09:26.022
if you get all your peas coming out of the same 
shell, all the same pod, you're in trouble. You

09:26.503 --> 09:27.646
want to have a mix of people. You want to have some 
people who spent time in Washington. You want to

09:29.589 --> 09:32.014
have some people who maybe spent time overseas. 
You want to have people who spent time in the

09:32.034 --> 09:36.282
Harvard Business School or something like that. 
You want to have this mix. I think it makes a

09:37.753 --> 09:40.996
stronger group. The whole community of 
oceanographic management will be stronger if you

09:41.016 --> 09:45.120
have this mix. You don't want them all the same. All 
ex-Washington bureaucrats would be terrible.

09:50.966 --> 09:51.947
All anything would be terrible. It would be 
terrible, right. I agree with that absolutely.

09:57.252 --> 10:06.201
Next series of questions concern your reaction to 
environmentalism,

09:57.252 --> 10:06.201
since you work with Erda and other people. What is 
your basic reaction to the environmental

10:06.603 --> 10:14.476
movement?

10:14.496 --> 10:28.778
Well, I think our awareness of environmental 
problems has come along very late in our human

10:14.496 --> 10:28.778
habitation of the planet, and many of our concerns 
are quite serious. The ocean is important. has an

10:31.274 --> 10:35.762
important role in the environment and in 
maintaining the quality of the environment. So

10:36.183 --> 10:42.855
it's important that oceanographers be heavily 
involved in the center of this discussion and this

10:36.183 --> 10:42.855
national debate, international debate. There 
has been a tendency in some groups, even including

10:44.277 --> 10:50.228
some oceanographers, to overreact on problems. 
On the other hand,

10:50.832 --> 10:56.138
there are people who I think are just crying wolf. 
On the other hand, I don't believe that we should

10:56.599 --> 11:00.383
back off from environmental questions. In fact, 
if we who work at the laboratories that have the

11:00.423 --> 11:07.632
means to get the data don't work on them, then all of 
society is going to suffer. So I think it's

11:08.653 --> 11:09.934
important that we work on them. I think it's 
important we work on them with as much scientific

11:09.974 --> 11:14.440
purity as we have. We should be intellectually 
honest when we do so. And I think most people I know

11:17.056 --> 11:18.777
are. There are a few individuals who are 
exploiters or alarmists and the chicken littles,

11:18.838 --> 11:25.403
the sky is falling types. And we find this in every 
walk of life in environmentalism. A lot of the

11:30.047 --> 11:33.030
issues, a lot of the environmental issues, I 
think, are overdrawn.

11:36.733 --> 11:43.179
Is it fair to say that as a scientist, when someone 
says such things as the ocean is dying or you

11:36.733 --> 11:43.179
disturb, do you feel as if it limits your role? It 
depends on who says it. And the person who says it is

11:48.123 --> 11:51.511
an oceanographer who has credibility. It bothers 
me. Nobody who said it yet, as far as I know, has the

11:52.875 --> 11:59.311
basis for saying that. The ocean is not dying. 
There are parts of the ocean which are badly

12:01.117 --> 12:02.960
poisoned. The ocean isn't dying. One or two 
species in it may be going extinct. And I wouldn't

12:10.191 --> 12:11.753
underestimate that. I wouldn't like to see the 
blue whale disappear. On the other hand, I think we

12:14.237 --> 12:17.001
have to live in a world where we harvest protein. 
And whales are part of the protein resource of the

12:17.041 --> 12:19.264
planet. Many people would say we should never 
harvest a whale. Don't understand the logic. If

12:25.514 --> 12:29.520
we're going to eat protein, the whale, to me, is no 
more sacred than a cow. and run the cattle on the

12:29.652 --> 12:48.707
grange you've got to use both of them effectively 
we've got to learn how to harvest whales we

12:29.652 --> 12:48.707
shouldn't this would be we're not using the planet 
effectively we don't harvest whales there's

12:29.652 --> 12:48.707
protein and oil and all kinds of things we need 
there and there are many crops there as far as i know

12:29.652 --> 12:48.707
there are many species of whales right now which 
are harvestable but for technical reasons, which

12:49.582 --> 12:52.705
were unharvestable for political reasons. I 
don't believe those political reasons are

12:52.745 --> 12:54.748
well-founded. But I wouldn't like to see the great 
blue whale go extinct either. I think that would be

12:58.312 --> 12:59.253
folly. I don't see why we should do that. I'd like to 
preserve our environment and the attractive

13:00.514 --> 13:13.328
features in it, but we're living here too, and 
man's a carnivore, and we've got to use the animals

13:00.514 --> 13:13.328
where they are, and whales are part of it. There's 
an example of what I think of as emotionalism. I

13:18.116 --> 13:22.822
think the whale issue is so tied up with emotion 
that we aren't talking straight about it.

13:27.827 --> 13:31.952
Let me try to sum it up and see if I have it right on the 
tape, okay? That you would agree essentially

13:32.172 --> 13:37.138
environmentalism is a good thing, but sometimes 
it's extremism of its proposed body? Well, I don't

13:39.269 --> 13:43.914
like the word environmentalism, because 
immediately that term is pejorative to me. I think

13:45.115 --> 13:58.470
that as marine or as terrestrial scientists, 
oceanographers have a responsibility to look at

13:45.115 --> 13:58.470
environmental problems, problems that maintain 
the quality of the environment. And many people I

13:59.131 --> 14:07.480
know are doing that and doing it responsibly and 
making solid, strong, positive contributions

14:07.831 --> 14:10.515
enabling us to stop some of the abuses that are 
going on. There are clearly many abuses going on.

14:12.558 --> 14:15.382
We are poisoning, polluting, and all this kind of 
stuff. We need to take action to stop that. Action

14:17.726 --> 14:22.734
can be more effectively done on the basis of good 
information, which can be gotten by scientific

14:17.726 --> 14:22.734
research. At the same time, I think the scientists 
also have a role in trying to stop some of the

14:23.294 --> 14:31.306
alarmists and publicity seekers who are doing 
this for their own ends. And there are a number of

14:31.887 --> 14:34.311
those as well, I'm sorry to say. And some of those 
have given environmentalism a bad name. So I bet if

14:38.553 --> 14:51.012
you talk to a lot of American industrialists and 
talk about environmentalists, they'll start

14:38.553 --> 14:51.012
foaming at the mouth and talk about those commies 
that are trying to keep us from making a profit for

14:38.553 --> 14:51.012
ridiculous reasons. And part of the reason 
they're foaming at the mouth Some of the people

14:53.680 --> 14:58.005
associated with the environmental movement have 
been irresponsible and haven't looked at both

14:53.680 --> 14:58.005
sides of it. We've got to get enough energy to keep 
our houses warm. We've got to get enough food to

15:01.350 --> 15:02.551
eat. Otherwise, we're committing suicide. We've 
got to do those things. The question is, how can we

15:06.756 --> 15:08.759
do it in the most effective way? And some of the 
so-called environmentalists would have is just

15:08.819 --> 15:16.508
not harvest food and not get energy and kind of turn 
their back to things. This is unrealistic. When

15:18.771 --> 15:23.417
you say environmentalists, I don't know whether 
that's what you mean or whether you mean

15:18.771 --> 15:23.417
oceanographers who are studying the 
environment. Well, I was thinking about the

15:23.498 --> 15:29.026
environmentalist movement itself, not really 
quite so much as oceanographers studying the

15:23.498 --> 15:29.026
environment. Well, I'm a little concerned about 
the environmentalist movement because I think

15:29.046 --> 15:33.553
it's gone out of hand in many cases. Now, in terms of 
oceanographers studying the environment, if I

15:35.196 --> 15:44.990
may ask questions there,

15:35.196 --> 15:44.990
what is the potential of the ocean, would you say? 
And there was a time when it was sort of assumed that

15:45.892 --> 15:52.662
the ocean would offer unlimited potential for... 
preserving and protecting man on Earth. They talk

15:56.273 --> 16:00.299
about mariculture and... Okay, I'm not an expert. 
Let me interrupt you. I'm not an expert on this.

16:04.445 --> 16:08.070
There are people who've done quantitative 
studies on what the ocean will do for food. The

16:08.510 --> 16:11.795
ocean will not do everything for food for man. 
It'll do a small portion of mankind's total food

16:11.815 --> 16:15.240
needs. maybe, or a significant portion, but not 
all, won't provide all our food, it won't provide

16:15.220 --> 16:30.283
all our energy, it won't provide anything, but 
it's part of the total contribution to man's food

16:15.220 --> 16:30.283
and energy and so forth, and that is, we don't know 
yet how to work it very effectively. But it's now,

16:31.285 --> 16:37.515
some of the statements were made a decade or two ago 
about aquaculture and all the rest of it. Many of

16:37.535 --> 16:42.342
them, when looked at quantitatively, turned out 
to have been exaggerations.

16:44.583 --> 16:47.949
Now, the next series of questions are personal 
questions. What probably surprised you the most

16:49.352 --> 16:54.722
in terms of technical innovations in your 
discipline of oceanography? Anything occur that

16:55.082 --> 16:56.765
you didn't expect to occur? What did you think was 
the most important technological development in

16:58.569 --> 17:03.638
your field during your career?

17:06.419 --> 17:07.541
It's really a two-part question. Were there any 
instruments developed which you didn't

17:08.041 --> 17:13.068
anticipate developing, which you think aided 
you? And of the instruments developed, which did

17:13.789 --> 17:16.473
you think were the most important?

17:21.240 --> 17:24.284
No, I don't find your question one that I can 
respond to. OK.

17:24.424 --> 17:32.916
Every instrument I've seen, there have been 
somebody standing around and said, that

17:24.424 --> 17:32.916
instrument can't be built. building 
instruments, for example, is an imagination

17:34.043 --> 17:38.531
combined with some good engineering. We've had 
some good engineers here at Woods Hole who've

17:38.591 --> 17:45.703
built a number of instruments that people are 
using around the country now, around the world

17:38.591 --> 17:45.703
right now. But I personally never was in a position 
where I thought, oh, that'll never, well, any

17:46.584 --> 17:52.173
given instrument, oh, that will never work. And I 
was surprised where it just didn't happen that

17:52.554 --> 17:54.618
way. Maybe if I had a mind that works slightly 
different, I might have thought that. As for the

17:58.825 --> 18:00.287
kind of I guess the second part of the question was, 
well, scientific advice or ideas? What

18:04.130 --> 18:05.912
scientific advance helped you the most? Probably 
technological advance rather than scientific

18:05.932 --> 18:07.813
advance. Oh, well, certainly in my own career, 
these more current meters are what I worked with.

18:12.958 --> 18:15.440
And it took a decade to get them to work right. And 
now they're highly well. They're 95%, 99%, 95%

18:16.481 --> 18:19.464
reliable right now. And they helped me a lot. I 
mean, that was my career. In the last few years, it

18:24.769 --> 18:28.532
was a scientist who was based heavily on data 
collected from instruments like this. And they

18:28.572 --> 18:30.814
were a completely new instrument. I was involved 
heavily with trying to get the darn things to work.

18:35.220 --> 18:37.004
Took several years of my life. Were there any other 
technological advances you think in your period

18:39.369 --> 18:45.844
of oceanography that pushed the science forward?

18:48.851 --> 18:49.933
Sort of quantum leaps. In the period when I've been 
active, I can't today identify a quantum leap. A

18:57.563 --> 19:00.587
quantum leap might be more easily identified with 
some perspective. And if we look at the history of

19:01.328 --> 19:06.556
oceanography, we might find, for example, the 
whole last 10 years have been nothing but one big,

19:01.328 --> 19:06.556
huge quantum leap. Certainly, we're doing things 
today we didn't do 10 years ago and the same as 10

19:06.576 --> 19:10.521
years before that. There's a whole host of 
instruments we think are standard today, CTDs,

19:10.940 --> 19:18.490
pardon the jargon, CTDs, so far floats, current 
meters. All these are things that didn't exist 10

19:18.891 --> 19:20.874
or 15 years ago. They're all of which we take for 
granted today. And maybe when the history of

19:23.017 --> 19:33.271
oceanography is written from the perspective of 
the year 2000 or something, we'll look back and

19:23.017 --> 19:33.271
say, my God, the years of the late 60s, early 70s 
were nothing but complete change over the field.

19:33.311 --> 19:34.112
And maybe... I've heard people say that the 
biggest change over in the field came about in the

19:34.615 --> 19:47.845
late 50s when oceanography went away from small 
sailing ships like the Atlantis into big ships

19:34.615 --> 19:47.845
like the chain where we could work anywhere in the 
world anytime, except in ice, let's say. And that

19:47.865 --> 19:50.852
completely changed the nature of the program as we 
did. Maybe when we get enough perspective and

19:51.136 --> 20:06.336
we're able to look back, we'll see if the biggest 
advance in oceanography came after the Second

19:51.136 --> 20:06.336
World War, 10 years or so after the end of the Second 
World War, in the mid to late 50s, when the U.S.

19:51.136 --> 20:06.336
finally was able to get large capability 
ocean-going vessels. Maybe. Theoretical

20:09.540 --> 20:12.124
advances in oceanography. Were there any which 
simply took you aback in your fields? Those that

20:17.210 --> 20:20.755
you were not expecting to curb?

20:23.570 --> 20:29.820
Well, no, I don't think so, although I've listened 
to a number of seminars from theoretical people,

20:23.570 --> 20:29.820
and they come up with an idea, and I'm like, gee, 
that's really great. I hadn't realized that would

20:29.840 --> 20:32.163
be like that. But once I heard him explain it, I 
thought, oh, that's reasonable. I don't know so

20:38.213 --> 20:40.196
much. I came in just after the period when Henry 
Stommel did his most important works. And it's

20:47.327 --> 20:51.433
clear looking now that his ideas about the 
westward intensification of ocean currents

20:51.683 --> 20:57.650
changed all our idea, all our theoretical ideas 
about ocean circulation. That happened in the

20:58.071 --> 21:00.353
decade just before I came into things. I came into 
things in, I came into oceanography in 58, let's

21:00.393 --> 21:08.983
say, and Stommel did his, his important paper on 
westward intensification was written in 48. So I

21:10.165 --> 21:18.855
came in 10 years after that, and by that time the, 
the fallout had been done, the damage had been

21:10.165 --> 21:18.855
done, and all kinds of people had rushed to get into 
the line and write papers cleaning up after him.

21:23.459 --> 21:33.169
In general terms of oceanography now, I don't mean 
just in your particular discipline, were there

21:23.459 --> 21:33.169
any theories advanced which took you aback or 
seemed amazing? C4 splitting, plate tectonics,

21:33.189 --> 21:39.675
all these things, of course, are already pretty 
well debated at the time you come into the field.

21:40.596 --> 21:41.617
No, C4 spreading. And C4 spreading is something 
that happened since I've been in the field, but it

21:41.778 --> 21:46.643
hadn't been my field. And no, it didn't take me much 
back. I was aware of the debates about

21:53.564 --> 22:02.138
continental drift, pro and con, back when I was a 
student. I was aware of mantle convection because

22:02.739 --> 22:16.703
of work I'd done in geomagnetism, and when people 
said, oh, it looks like they're spreading at the

22:02.739 --> 22:16.703
center due to expression of crustal

22:16.683 --> 22:21.849
convection and things like that, mantle 
convection, seemed reasonable to me. I mean, I

22:22.290 --> 22:23.171
wouldn't have done it. I'm not trying to claim any 
wisdom or anything. It just didn't seem

22:26.175 --> 22:30.761
unreasonable to me. Future career. What next? 
What do you intend to do? Do you intend to stay as

22:34.866 --> 22:38.330
administrator, return to being an active 
oceanographer? What new problems would you like

22:38.410 --> 22:40.833
to attack, if any? I don't know what I'll do. I 
haven't made up my mind. It's not obvious that I

22:45.016 --> 22:46.942
will stay as an administrator. I'd like to keep 
that option open, and I have the option, I think.

22:51.735 --> 22:55.246
Although it's dangerous staying as an 
administrator because your brain cells atrophy.

22:56.890 --> 23:00.240
The nature of research is to quietly get deeply 
involved into something with a high degree of

23:00.659 --> 23:05.506
intellectual penetration. The nature of 
administration is to give quick, rapid answers to

23:06.046 --> 23:12.816
questions on a variety of subjects so you get a 
superficial thing. These two talents fight

23:12.856 --> 23:17.102
against each other. And you've got to watch out 
when you're a scientist against the superficial

23:17.182 --> 23:20.506
answer. And you don't do a good job that way. So the 
longer you stay as administrator, the more you

23:22.129 --> 23:28.658
begin to take pride in giving a shoot from the hip on 
answers. But that's not the way you do good

23:28.698 --> 23:30.480
science. But I don't know what I'm going to do. You 
don't have any clearly laid out plans for

23:33.383 --> 23:38.870
research? No. At the moment, I don't have any 
clearly laid out plans for research. That's

23:41.674 --> 23:41.975
right. There's a number of things going on that 
intrigue me. For example, satellites.

23:49.205 --> 23:51.629
My base is more in instruments. Maybe there's a new 
instrument that might allow us to get data to make a

23:52.390 --> 23:57.497
whole new set of things. a whole new set of ideas 
about the ocean. My impression looking at them

24:00.147 --> 24:03.937
right now is we're not quite ready for it, so I'm a 
little hesitant about it. But there's an example,

24:05.400 --> 24:07.606
maybe something like that. If you were going to 
offer advice to a student again, personal advice

24:07.646 --> 24:13.360
to a student, What particular discipline of 
oceanography would you suggest he choose? Where

24:19.192 --> 24:22.659
do you think, in a cliche, where's the action going 
to be in the future? I don't know. If you ask me, I

24:23.982 --> 24:25.805
can't answer that question. I don't think anybody 
knows. I think anybody that says he does it is just

24:26.887 --> 24:29.673
posing. I think that... If you say where the job is 
going to be, I can tell you that right now there are

24:32.324 --> 24:40.017
more unemployed biological oceanographers and 
maybe geological oceanographers. And I don't

24:40.578 --> 24:44.144
know of any competent unemployed physical 
oceanographer. And most chemical

24:44.605 --> 24:46.549
oceanographers are well employed. But who's 
going to make the next breakthrough? I don't know.

24:49.073 --> 24:55.564
You might answer that maybe the next big 
breakthrough is going to be in biological

24:49.073 --> 24:55.564
oceanography, because men have been kind of 
insomniac and disciplined. discipline, and

24:55.544 --> 24:58.107
there hasn't been much out of it for quite a while. 
It's the most difficult of all the branches, so

24:58.147 --> 25:01.932
it's so complex. Maybe somebody will do something 
quantitative in biological oceanography and

25:01.952 --> 25:10.642
revolutionize everything, but on the other hand, 
it's a hell of a job, hell of a field to get a good job

25:01.952 --> 25:10.642
in, because there's too many people in it. Okay. Is 
there anything you'd like to add to the table?

25:18.732 --> 25:20.294
No, it's, I can't think so. It's hard to If I had to 
replay the tape, I wouldn't give you the same

25:21.970 --> 25:24.993
answers twice. Well, that means we won't replay 
the tape, huh? No, of course not. But it's

25:28.778 --> 25:36.446
interesting to have the opportunity for some 
self-reflection on some of these questions,

25:28.778 --> 25:36.446
introspection on some of these questions. No, I 
can't think of anything else. I can't think of any

25:38.649 --> 25:41.953
question I was dying to have you ask me, so I get it 
off my chest. All right. Well, that's good enough.

25:43.615 --> 25:43.995
OK, good.
