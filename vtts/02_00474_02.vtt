WEBVTT

00:03.085 --> 00:05.468
So they said, no, that would be it for the day. So we 
were just getting ready to rev up our engines. And

00:11.517 --> 00:14.341
we had our engines running the whole time. But when 
you're sitting waiting or something, you turn

00:14.381 --> 00:18.006
down the RPMs. And so we were just getting ready to 
rev them up and take off. And one lone rocket was

00:24.936 --> 00:28.522
dropped into the LZ. And it hit about . I'd say maybe 
five yards from the helicopter on my side. When it

00:40.625 --> 00:56.346
hit, the impact

00:40.625 --> 00:56.346
almost threw me over on top of the co-pilot, which 
sits on the left-hand side of the aircraft. And out

00:56.731 --> 01:00.676
of instinct, he took off. And the other, our lead 
man, took off. And at the time, we didn't really

01:05.683 --> 01:12.452
know what had happened other than there was a big 
bang. I sort of looked down. At a time like that, you

01:16.837 --> 01:24.207
don't really feel that much. I looked down and 
noticed my arm was bleeding, and it was bleeding

01:24.997 --> 01:29.804
quite heavily. So I grabbed the pressure point in 
my upper right arm, and

01:30.605 --> 01:40.460
the bleeding stopped.

01:42.964 --> 01:44.426
But I couldn't work my right hand. So with my left 
hand, I got on the intercom. and asked the crew how

01:52.081 --> 01:54.924
they were. And the crew chief and the gunner down in 
the belly said they were OK. And then the co-pilot

01:56.086 --> 02:12.925
said he was OK. We tried to contact the other 
helicopter on the radio, and there was no

01:56.086 --> 02:12.925
response. Our radios had been shot out. We had 
intercom within the helicopter, but no radio

02:14.607 --> 02:21.075
contact.

02:22.962 --> 02:50.202
copilot took off and in the meantime I was holding 
onto my arm trying to keep the bleeding down and

02:22.962 --> 02:50.202
we lost sight of our lead helicopter but the 
copilot was losing power in our helicopter and

02:22.962 --> 02:50.202
couldn't get any altitude and we got about maybe a 
mile and a half or two miles out of Camp Carroll and

02:50.620 --> 03:15.649
we always called it Charlie Charlie and he started 
losing total control I mean we just started

02:50.620 --> 03:15.649
sloshing all over the place like a wounded duck so 
he set it down in an open field

02:50.620 --> 03:15.649
and so he went through the procedures right quick, 
shutting down the engine, stopping the rotor

03:16.658 --> 03:21.305
blades and everything. And we looked back, and the 
lead helicopter had seen us going down, so they

03:21.946 --> 03:29.157
were coming down to pick us up. So we quite hastily 
got out and ran to get in the other helicopter. And

03:39.312 --> 03:44.961
all this time, there was really no pain.

03:46.240 --> 03:55.569
I saw blood and all that, and like I said, the crew 
chief and the gunner both said that they were okay.

03:55.589 --> 04:03.177
Once we got in the other aircraft, we found out that 
I had been hitting the right arm and the right leg.

04:04.178 --> 04:13.547
The crew chief had been hitting both calves, the 
left calf and the right calf, and the gunner had

04:04.178 --> 04:13.547
been hitting the right calf. And didn't even know 
it until we got in the other airplane. So right away

04:17.730 --> 04:29.001
they ran us, hustled us on down to Dong Ha to Delta 
Med and

04:17.730 --> 04:29.001
got us in the first aid down there. And I didn't see 
the other two, the crew chief and the gunner, for I

04:29.862 --> 04:42.994
guess it was two days before I saw them again. They 
put us aboard C-130 at Dong Ha, flew us down to Phu

04:43.582 --> 05:11.175
Bai, and got into,

04:43.582 --> 05:11.175
I don't remember what the designation of the med 
station was down there, but they performed

04:43.582 --> 05:11.175
surgery on me there and took out all but one piece of 
shrapnel, which I still have in my leg.

05:14.463 --> 05:20.210
But it was sort of ironic, I guess. I don't know if 
that's the right term or anything. But this

05:22.392 --> 05:24.494
happened on a Monday. I think it was, if I'm not 
mistaken, it was April the 13th. It was either

05:29.220 --> 05:31.202
April the 13th or May the 13th. And

05:33.264 --> 05:42.715
it was May the 13th.

05:43.640 --> 05:49.228
Monday, and on Friday, I was already scheduled to 
meet my wife in Hawaii for R&R. And

05:51.031 --> 06:01.125
I just, the only thing that passed through my mind 
when I got hit was, oh no, there goes my R&R, what am I

05:51.031 --> 06:01.125
gonna do? I wasn't worried about dying at all. I was 
just worried about missing my R&R. So, a chaplain

06:07.054 --> 06:12.482
came through, ward

06:13.036 --> 06:40.140
where I was in Fubi and I told him what the situation 
was about meeting my wife in Hawaii and all this and

06:13.036 --> 06:40.140
I asked him to contact her and let her know that I had 
been wounded but I was okay and that I wouldn't be

06:13.036 --> 06:40.140
able to meet her in Hawaii so he said okay he'd take 
care of it and So on Tuesday, the next day, they

06:41.538 --> 07:08.254
decided that I could go ahead and be transferred 
back out to the ship where we were operating off of,

06:41.538 --> 07:08.254
and let the flight surgeon, and they had a 
tremendous medical staff on board ship too, and

06:41.538 --> 07:08.254
let them take care of me. Got back out to the ship, 
and I talked to the flight surgeon. He checked me

07:12.411 --> 07:22.184
over and checked all my stitches and everything, 
and he said he thought it'd be okay, if I felt like

07:12.411 --> 07:22.184
it, to go ahead and go to Hawaii. So I said, okay, 
we'll go for it. So I figured that my wife wouldn't

07:24.968 --> 07:33.860
be there, but I'd be there, and I'd call her as soon 
as I got there, and she could be there the next day,

07:24.968 --> 07:33.860
so we'd miss one day out of a five-day R&R. So when I 
got there, I wasn't even looking for her. But she

07:39.200 --> 07:43.566
was there because she was never contacted that I 
was not going to be there. So we had a pretty good

07:44.668 --> 07:47.793
R&R. But it was quite strange because at the time, 
she was living with her parents. And this was in

07:58.388 --> 07:59.410
May. And she had given birth to our first daughter 
in February.

08:09.068 --> 08:14.936
So her daughter was three months old, and she was 
too young to come with her. So it was just she and I.

08:20.023 --> 08:29.596
And as it came to pass, I didn't see my daughter 
until November when I got home, and she was nine

08:20.023 --> 08:29.596
months old at the time. I saw some pictures of her, 
but I didn't see my daughter until she was nine

08:29.617 --> 08:37.928
months old.

08:39.190 --> 08:46.717
With the wound and everything, I was a little 
incapacitated. I wasn't quite able to perform up

08:47.438 --> 08:51.562
to expectations. But when there's a will, there's 
a way. So we had a pretty good R&R, five days in

08:57.488 --> 09:01.191
Hawaii. You can't argue with that. And then after 
the R&R, I went back to Hawaii. when I got back into

09:08.941 --> 09:37.851
Nam I flew into Da Nang and at the time our squadron 
was in the process of changing ships and so they had

09:08.941 --> 09:37.851
offloaded back into Phu Bai for about three days 
prior they offloaded And then three days later,

09:38.860 --> 09:43.526
they were supposed to load back onto the other 
ship. And so the flight surgeon said that it would

09:44.728 --> 09:52.238
be cleaner surroundings for me to stay in Da Nang. 
So I stayed in Da Nang during all this and went back

09:52.318 --> 09:59.147
aboard ship after everything was all situated and 
everything. And I was unable to fly for 89 days with

09:59.954 --> 10:07.703
my wound and wounds. And I don't remember exactly 
when it was, but it was about six weeks, I guess,

10:08.584 --> 10:16.153
after the wound. I was all set to go down and get an up 
chip from the flight surgeon so I could start

10:16.174 --> 10:21.420
flying again. And I woke up in the morning, and I had 
a big old pus pocket on my leg where my wound was.

10:31.730 --> 10:46.263
I went down and they lanced it and had to go in and 
remove another piece of shrapnel

10:31.730 --> 10:46.263
which had a little bit of flight suit on it and 
that's what caused the infection.

10:48.145 --> 10:59.475
So I spent a total of 89 relatively boring days 
aboard ship watching movies at night and sitting

10:48.145 --> 10:59.475
in the room listening to tapes and the like during 
the day.

11:05.988 --> 11:11.896
It was

11:05.988 --> 11:11.896
quite boring, absolutely. Ship life is boring 
anyway, but when you can't get out and do anything,

11:13.178 --> 11:19.467
you know, it's really terrible. Where was this 
ship stationed? It was off the coast. I don't know

11:23.753 --> 11:25.416
how far off the coast. I'd say probably about 20 or 
25 miles in the Fu Ba Quang tree area. It had a

11:33.197 --> 11:56.023
specific pattern that it would run, but it was 
quite close to the coast at all times, except I'd

11:33.197 --> 11:56.023
almost forgotten about this, but during my 
convalescent period, the ship had to go back to the

11:56.965 --> 12:06.103
Philippines for some

11:56.965 --> 12:06.103
kind of repairs. I'm not even sure what it was. And 
so I stayed on board the ship.

12:17.887 --> 12:18.147
Excuse me. with one other officer and about six 
enlisted men from our squadron and went with the

12:19.173 --> 12:39.713
ship to the Philippines and had another what you 
might call R&R there.

12:41.195 --> 12:48.564
We had a little bit of work to do on about three of the 
helicopters, which the enlisted men took care of.

12:49.425 --> 12:59.318
And the other officer, Captain McAlka, he was a 
designated test pilot. And in order for me to go,

13:00.239 --> 13:07.388
they had to designate me as a test pilot too, just to 
make it what you might call a legal trip. even

13:09.106 --> 13:11.288
though it didn't do any flying. It doesn't do much 
good to be a test pilot when you're grounded anyway

13:12.189 --> 13:17.655
because of wounds. But I think we spent about seven 
or eight days in the Philippines, which was sort of

13:17.675 --> 13:33.291
nice, but then again,

13:17.675 --> 13:33.291
unconsequential.

13:37.338 --> 13:39.742
You were in Vietnam during the Tet Offensive. What 
did you know about it, and how did it affect you?

13:48.315 --> 14:06.602
Well, at the time, we pretty much called it the way 
offensive, since we were

13:48.315 --> 14:06.602
stationed at Phu Bai at the time, which was only, 
oh, roughly speaking, I guess 12 to 15 miles south

13:48.315 --> 14:06.602
of Hue. We had a little bit of an inkling about it a 
day or two ahead of time that something seemed to be

14:07.392 --> 14:15.263
brewing. And of course Tet being a national 
holiday or a period of celebration or whatever.

14:27.240 --> 14:36.032
I'm not sure if it's their New Year's or what, but 
anyway it's a time of celebration for the

14:27.240 --> 14:36.032
Vietnamese.

14:37.244 --> 14:43.452
But there seemed to be a little more activity prior 
to it than in the past. And everybody was sort of

14:43.893 --> 14:53.986
warned to, well, I wouldn't say warned, but 
informed to keep your eye out. And before we knew

14:55.027 --> 15:01.055
it, the way had been overtaken. I mean, just slam 
and it was done.

15:09.458 --> 15:17.490
It didn't affect us, even being as close as we were, 
it didn't affect us too terribly much as far as

15:09.458 --> 15:17.490
security was concerned. It stepped up our 
activity quite a bit as far as CNC missions,

15:19.673 --> 15:29.408
medevac, and the like.

15:32.333 --> 15:38.622
We would take some incoming rockets and mortars at 
night.

15:40.947 --> 15:46.456
It's amazing how fast you can get out of a hooch and 
into a bunker when you need to. You can almost hear

15:47.979 --> 15:56.053
the mortars leaving the tubes in your sleep, so 
you're halfway there before you wake up. We didn't

15:57.367 --> 15:59.310
have any casualties from incoming. You weren't on 
the ship at this time? No, we were in Fubai. Because

16:04.197 --> 16:11.748
this was in, I can't remember exactly what the 
dates are for Tet, but it's January or February or

16:04.197 --> 16:11.748
something like that. We didn't go aboard ship 
until March, I believe it was. So we were in Fubai at

16:14.853 --> 16:17.157
the time. And we had

16:24.822 --> 16:29.448
like I say, some CNC missions in the way and some 
medevac. It was really sort of funny in a way, but

16:30.930 --> 16:36.899
then again quite dangerous. One day we were going 
in for a medevac and we got a call in and they told us

16:37.800 --> 16:54.643
the approximate coordinates for the LZ in the city 
of Way.

16:56.750 --> 17:26.048
it was always a common practice of course the 
grunts didn't hold up to it very well but if you

16:56.750 --> 17:26.048
didn't know exactly where the LZ was the 
helicopter would ask the radio controller on the

16:56.750 --> 17:26.048
ground he would say pop a smoke pop a smoke grenade 
and the guy on the ground was supposed to pop a smoke

16:56.750 --> 17:26.048
grenade and then the helicopter pilot would 
confirm the color of the smoke. Well, this radio

17:35.756 --> 17:43.763
operator on the ground, we said, pop a smoke. And he 
said, Roger, pop in a yellow smoke. And he threw out

17:46.986 --> 17:48.827
a yellow smoke grenade. And there were five yellow 
smoke grenades thrown out in the city of Hue. So,

17:56.183 --> 18:07.436
you know, that's why the practice is to throw out 
the smoke and then you ask what color it is or

17:56.183 --> 18:07.436
whatever instead of saying what color you're 
going to pop. It's which of those five are you going

18:07.456 --> 18:09.839
to land at? And it was quite scary, you know. Some of 
these guys on the ground, if they don't know what

18:16.146 --> 18:22.293
the procedure is, could really wipe somebody out. 
What did they end up doing? Well, we asked him to pop

18:23.723 --> 18:29.489
another smoke and not say what color it was. No, we 
didn't ask him to. We just flat told him to. And we

18:33.273 --> 18:45.306
took a little fire on the way in, but, you know, from 
the surrounding area, but we made a safe in and out

18:33.273 --> 18:45.306
trip. You mentioned that y'all called it the Huey 
Offensive. You weren't familiar with the Tet

18:51.253 --> 18:53.595
Offensive that that was a day before the Hue 
Offensive that happened in Saigon. Were you all

18:59.446 --> 19:01.088
familiar with it at the time? At

19:02.269 --> 19:08.997
my position in the rank and file, no. I would 
imagine possibly that our squadron commander

19:10.459 --> 19:18.047
knew about it or whatever.

19:20.390 --> 19:31.700
The ordinary pilots and the ones who were not 
involved in intelligence and the like didn't

19:20.390 --> 19:31.700
really have any knowledge of it until afterwards. 
The way was right there, and that's all we were

19:33.182 --> 19:35.824
concerned about. Did you observe any kind of 
changes after the Huey offensive

19:38.166 --> 19:49.857
in strategy, military strategy? or what not? The 
whole pace of the war seemed, war, conflict seemed

19:53.737 --> 20:01.869
to pick up. And it's sort of hard for me to say since I 
was not directly involved with anything in

20:18.457 --> 20:20.840
S2, which is intelligence.

20:24.786 --> 20:40.587
It's hard to say actually

20:24.786 --> 20:40.587
what changes there might have been because, like I 
say, in March we went aboard ship, which changed

20:24.786 --> 20:40.587
our whole strategy and tactics anyway.

20:43.451 --> 20:47.957
But then again,

20:48.460 --> 20:50.783
There was a whole lot more activity. The Army was 
brought into that northern area. Khe Sanh fell. We

20:58.751 --> 21:00.493
were quite involved with Khe Sanh. We would have 
C&C and medevac patrols up there all the time, our

21:00.533 --> 21:08.702
squadron. And the Army moved into Khe Sanh, and 
later on Khe Sanh fell. And so I'm

21:17.452 --> 21:39.763
sure that all that was a direct

21:17.452 --> 21:39.763
result of the way offensive, or Ted offensive, as 
such.

21:39.783 --> 21:47.273
What impact did the press have on, in your opinion, 
the outcome of the war? or the people back home? And

21:50.457 --> 21:54.401
did you have any contact with the press at all? Did 
you ever see any journalists or anything while you

21:55.202 --> 22:00.748
were in Vietnam? There was one time when we had

22:03.010 --> 22:18.306
some kind of a large insert, a troop insert that we 
were involved with, that I heard that there was a

22:18.742 --> 22:20.704
journalist going to make the trip. But I did not see 
the man personally, and I don't know whether

22:22.927 --> 22:35.202
he conducted interviews with any of our people or 
not. If he did, it wasn't known. He may have

22:40.468 --> 22:48.478
interviewed some of the soldiers that were put in 
or whatever, but I didn't have any contact with him

22:40.468 --> 22:48.478
at all. As far as impact of the press on the Vietnam 
incident, it's hard to say. With the news media

22:58.538 --> 23:12.515
being this up-to-date and on top of everything the 
way they are now versus, say, like in World War I,

22:58.538 --> 23:12.515
World War II, everybody knows almost before it 
happens what happens. And I'm sure it was quite...

23:21.685 --> 23:46.526
disarming to the

23:21.685 --> 23:46.526
family and loved ones back home of the men in 
Vietnam hearing every day that so many had been

23:21.685 --> 23:46.526
killed and so many had been wounded and trying to 
show the score like a football game as to who killed

23:21.685 --> 23:46.526
the most that day. You can't really build morale on 
that, I don't believe. Do you think that was an

23:52.516 --> 24:00.627
effective way of telling how the war was going, who 
killed the most? Was that an effective measure?

24:04.472 --> 24:04.752
No. It's hard to say what would have been an 
effective measure for Vietnam. The way it

24:15.627 --> 24:20.093
actually turned out, nobody won and everybody 
lost.

24:21.794 --> 24:28.642
I'm sure there would have been different ways for 
things to have been handled. I don't know what. I

24:31.985 --> 24:35.289
mean, who can second guess politicians and 
everything? Politicians have always cracked my

24:37.211 --> 24:51.447
ass anyway in the fact that they're more concerned 
about their Democratic Party or their Republican

24:37.211 --> 24:51.447
Party than they are about the American people and 
the American nation as a whole. to do anything for a

24:52.152 --> 24:53.773
damn vote. Do you think the politicians had an 
effect?

25:00.119 --> 25:02.681
What kind of effect do you think they had on the 
outcome of the war? Well, I think they loused it up.

25:06.745 --> 25:09.948
It was a loused-up situation to begin with. But as 
far as... I don't know. Public opinion had a lot to

25:17.895 --> 25:21.518
do with... with the outcome of the war, if 
everybody had not been afraid of making a

25:22.088 --> 25:45.000
decision, be it right or wrong, and going ahead and 
made a decision somewhere earlier in the game, I

25:22.088 --> 25:45.000
think it could have been ended a lot sooner and to 
our benefit. But everyone was afraid of what the

25:45.020 --> 25:49.446
other guy was going to think about it. It was a 
waste, a total waste. I'm proud to have served for

25:56.477 --> 26:10.014
my country, and I did what little part I did, but it 
was a farce and injustice. You referred to before,

26:10.514 --> 26:17.963
first you said the Vietnam War, and then you change 
it to rather the conflict. You seem to be reluctant

26:18.604 --> 26:20.867
to call it a war. Is that because we didn't declare 
war? Right. Nobody wants to call it a war. They were

26:26.988 --> 26:28.911
afraid to declare war. It's sort of related to the 
Korean incident or conflict or whatever. It takes

26:40.027 --> 26:51.023
an act of Congress to declare war, but then again 
they can send all the young men of the country over

26:40.027 --> 26:51.023
to sacrifice their life and limbs. and think they 
can get by without calling it a war. But if they had

26:55.412 --> 26:58.735
gone ahead and declared war, I think we could have 
won it. Do you think we should have, LBJ should have

26:59.936 --> 27:03.700
called in the reserves?

27:06.122 --> 27:10.186
I don't think the reserves would have had any 
effect on it. He had plenty of resources to use

27:12.509 --> 27:19.896
without the reserves if he would have just used the 
right resources. Okay.

27:25.098 --> 27:33.286
Do you have any opinion about a certain way we 
should have gone about it in order to win the war?

27:33.886 --> 27:34.727
How could we have won? Any particular way? You 
might have done things differently. No, no real

27:39.312 --> 27:41.855
strategies or anything like that. I'm not a 
strategist or the like, but just needed to go in and

27:41.915 --> 27:50.203
kick ass and get it over with. Like I say, they had 
all

27:51.668 --> 28:07.404
the technology and the firepower and the manpower 
to do something about it, but they'd take one step

27:51.668 --> 28:07.404
forward and two steps back, and you can't win by 
doing like that. What kind of feelings or what kind

28:07.424 --> 28:16.633
of welcome did you have when you went back home as 
far as the anti-war movement? Was it going on at the

28:17.433 --> 28:18.955
time? How were the veterans treated? when they 
returned?

28:25.597 --> 28:27.058
Well, I come from a small town. And everybody 
pretty well knows everybody. Of course, my family

28:34.245 --> 28:36.968
welcomed me back with open arms. But I'd walk down 
the street, and the general people would act like,

28:37.869 --> 28:47.118
well, you've been gone away for a while. What you 
been doing? And I'd say, well, I just got back from

28:49.320 --> 28:51.342
Vietnam. Oh, really? You know, big deal. They 
really didn't give a damn if I was in Vietnam or next

28:54.684 --> 28:59.429
door or what.

29:02.232 --> 29:15.588
There was no real antagonism towards me or where 
I'd been or what I'd done, but there was no moral

29:02.232 --> 29:15.588
support in saying, boy, I'm sure glad you're back. 
I'm sure glad you went over and did your job and all

29:16.529 --> 29:19.472
that. people didn't seem to give a damn. As far as 
anti-war movement was concerned, I didn't really

29:22.749 --> 29:27.794
notice any. Anytime you have anything like that, 
you're going to have some, but

29:29.415 --> 29:42.487
the major portion came later on, like with Kent 
State and the like. At the time that I was in, it was

29:43.147 --> 29:48.632
very negligible.

29:52.240 --> 29:59.227
But it really did right my ass that people just 
didn't really give a damn. You think the vets were

29:59.547 --> 30:07.034
looked down upon for maybe what the American 
people saw on TV? Did they blame y'all?

30:10.837 --> 30:12.819
Did you get any of those kind of feelings? I didn't 
personally. Like I say, I'm from a small town, and

30:14.861 --> 30:21.167
things like that don't get developed quite as 
much. But

30:22.784 --> 30:35.696
there were a number of vets that did get frowned 
upon, evidently, according to the media and the

30:22.784 --> 30:35.696
like later on. But I think a lot of that's brought on 
by the vets in the fact that, like I was mentioning

30:36.296 --> 30:51.070
earlier, they think the United States and society 
owes them for what they did, which I totally

30:36.296 --> 30:51.070
disagree with. Okay, how much of a disruption did 
the war have on your family relationship as far as

30:51.792 --> 31:04.469
not seeing your daughter until nine months after 
she was born with your wife? What kind of effect did

31:05.069 --> 31:06.812
that have on you?

31:11.458 --> 31:21.411
There was more of an effect between me and my 
daughter than... my wife and I.

31:26.867 --> 31:40.462
There was no problem between my wife and I. I think 
there was a little bit of, and probably still is, a

31:26.867 --> 31:40.462
little bit of a problem between my daughter and I, 
even though it's hard to put your finger on it. I

31:40.482 --> 31:42.384
came back from Vietnam. She was nine months old. I 
didn't get to go through the latter stages of

31:49.640 --> 32:02.478
pregnancy or the birth, the first few weeks and the 
first few months with her just becoming a person.

32:03.319 --> 32:13.774
And when I got home, she was a nine-month,

32:03.319 --> 32:13.774
what can you say, crying machine. And it got to me at 
times. I

32:17.890 --> 32:29.423
hate to say it, but I'm sure somewhere along the 
line I've sort of maybe held that against her a

32:17.890 --> 32:29.423
little bit. Who did you hold it against? Well, I 
held it, I guess, against my daughter in the fact

32:31.565 --> 32:44.419
that here I was coming back from Vietnam

32:31.565 --> 32:44.419
wanting some peace and tranquility in my life. And 
she was there

32:48.046 --> 32:59.019
to, I guess you might say, come between my wife and 
I. And

32:59.579 --> 33:06.527
I hope I haven't harmed her. I've tried to make up 
for it. But then again, I believe Somewhere in

33:13.964 --> 33:26.097
there, there's got to be some repercussion of my 
coming back showing, and I'm sure I did, show some

33:13.964 --> 33:26.097
animosity towards him. Do you have any particular 
bitterness towards any politician, a president

33:27.418 --> 33:40.672
maybe, or any other person to this day as a result of 
the war? Do you carry any bitterness with you?

33:45.773 --> 34:01.590
Well, there's a certain degree of bitterness, I 
would say, but I can't really pinpoint it on any

33:45.773 --> 34:01.590
person or administration.

34:03.693 --> 34:08.738
Something like that was an error on everyone's 
part. And

34:08.758 --> 34:15.105
in order to say that any one person or the like is at 
fault would be an injustice on my part because I'm

34:15.828 --> 34:23.037
in no position to say
