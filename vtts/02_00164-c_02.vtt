WEBVTT

00:03.440 --> 00:06.765
and then selected Jarvis Miller as president. 
Were you still a commandant? I was in the police

00:09.889 --> 00:12.333
department. I went to the police department in the 
summer of 77. Okay, before Dr. Miller became

00:15.417 --> 00:18.081
president. All right, describe how that change 
came. Well, it didn't really affect me. Woodall

00:27.454 --> 00:29.577
took over my job. But how were you selected as 
president? John Coldis, he was having problems

00:32.414 --> 00:48.803
with the police department because the police 
chief over there was a good old guy, you know,

00:32.414 --> 00:48.803
passed away and took the ringer and the son of the 
other. But he had a couple of women employees ask

00:48.783 --> 00:57.958
for jobs and he said, I got my quota of women and 
things like that. And he needed somebody over

00:57.979 --> 01:03.448
there that was a little more attuned to life today. 
And so he asked me about taking on that job and that

01:03.548 --> 01:10.740
position. And I said I wouldn't be very interested 
in it, and so I just moved from one to the other. I

01:19.139 --> 01:23.110
took military leave for my last 30 days and started 
working for the university. And you reported

01:23.892 --> 01:26.299
directly to Coldis. Right. Did he give you any 
directions or guidance? One thing they wanted to

01:30.350 --> 01:40.506
do was to try to improve the image of the police with 
the students and the staff faculty. And there was

01:40.526 --> 01:47.356
no way really that it could happen with the parking 
situation the way it was. And that was the best

01:48.177 --> 01:52.624
thing that ever happened as far as police was 
concerned was separating it and having a traffic

01:52.908 --> 01:57.052
and a police. That's really why I left. I had all of 
it I could stomach. I was taken it home with me and

02:01.876 --> 02:06.501
nothing I could do about it. And we really were 
concerned, but you're personally blamed for it.

02:12.386 --> 02:15.389
And, you know, that parking garage is there now. We 
recommended that way, way back. And we did a

02:18.192 --> 02:20.434
parking study that about half of the one that they 
adopted, they included into that thing, and I'm

02:20.870 --> 02:31.045
sure that company used what we'd spent time trying 
to work out, about gates and all this other stuff.

02:31.065 --> 02:35.571
Not near as sophisticated as this, but it was a 
miserable job. When you took over as campus

02:36.052 --> 02:46.928
security and traffic, how many professionals 
were there in those units? The total commissioned

02:47.903 --> 03:05.697
officers was 49 and we had 8 or 10

02:47.903 --> 03:05.697
secretaries and we had 10 or 12 student workers. 
Did you inherit any problems right off that you had

03:05.717 --> 03:08.663
to? Oh yeah, I inherited the one on not hiring 
another woman and, you know, we have equal

03:08.963 --> 03:36.186
opportunities people and we got that 
straightened out and we offered her a job and she

03:08.963 --> 03:36.186
didn't want to come to the police department after 
that but they got her a job on campus making more

03:08.963 --> 03:36.186
money and we had, you know, we're always getting 
threatened, we're going to sue you, this, that, or

03:08.963 --> 03:36.186
the other and I paid for that parking spot and All 
that stuff, so you spent most of the time doing

03:36.892 --> 03:39.337
that. We had the wrong person dealing with 
complaints. Maddox was not a very popular person,

03:46.731 --> 03:54.166
and I don't know that he was treating people 
fairly. Probably wasn't. And Bob White did the

03:57.260 --> 04:01.125
right thing getting rid of him. And Russ McDonald, 
I did the wrong thing making him police chief. I did

04:09.194 --> 04:15.602
it because he was the finest sergeant major I ever 
had, but he couldn't forget that he was sergeant

04:09.194 --> 04:15.602
major. And he handled the police pretty much the 
same way, and that's the wrong way. But he did some

04:21.429 --> 04:23.171
good things too. And I might mention here 
something you probably don't know, But the

04:26.943 --> 04:36.468
program that the police have where if you want to 
turn somebody in and get the money, what do you call

04:26.943 --> 04:36.468
it? I forget the number. We don't want your name. We 
just want your information. It started with Rush

04:42.687 --> 04:46.350
McDonald for the state of Texas. He went to New 
Mexico to represent the police department in a

04:46.851 --> 05:01.864
police meeting and New Mexico had used that system 
and he came back with it and they were all excited

04:46.851 --> 05:01.864
about it and I said, well, go to work on it and see 
what you can do. And we got together with the

05:02.625 --> 05:10.112
college station in Brown and set one up and we 
provided an officer full time to answer the phone

05:10.615 --> 05:18.828
And he got the community to support the money and 
then he carried it before the Texas people and the

05:10.615 --> 05:18.828
police business and they got adopted. So we were 
the people in the state of Texas for that program.

05:24.216 --> 05:31.768
Now, when you took over, the headquarters was 
where the development foundation building is

05:24.216 --> 05:31.768
now. Right. And in terms of the hour demands on your 
time, How did that job compare with Commandant?

05:43.602 --> 05:57.006
Well, I pretty well went home at 5 o'clock, but my 
phone rang after that, and it was not a fun job, so I

05:43.602 --> 05:57.006
went home with my problems. Were there any high 
moments, pleasant moments? Well, most of the

06:02.962 --> 06:12.158
people were good people to work with and we'd go 
over there and visit them every time we'd come down

06:02.962 --> 06:12.158
here. We were really pleased with them and a lot of 
them are still around here. But I didn't, not very

06:19.951 --> 06:23.517
many people ever said thank you. And there was 
nothing like the joy of seeing the Corps march by.

06:27.524 --> 06:28.345
That's right. It's just a totally different 
environment. And I had to be over there at the

06:31.423 --> 06:38.194
football games because most of the people were 
there. And the traffic, people fussed about it

06:39.056 --> 06:41.059
there. And I was still going to midnight yell 
practice because I was still in under the, had the,

06:47.022 --> 06:51.890
you know, leaders under my advisory capacity. And 
those sort of things were a pretty full day. But,

06:57.039 --> 07:00.445
and it just wasn't the same feeling. I wouldn't 
have, I wouldn't have stayed much longer in the

07:00.525 --> 07:06.295
River Coast. Now you did that for how many years? 
until I was 83. 83, so six years. Dr. Miller, as

07:12.841 --> 07:19.611
president, what were your relations with him? Not 
much. I had very little to learn. And so you

07:25.821 --> 07:29.187
reported directly to Coldus? Until about a year or 
so before I left, and they turned it over to

07:31.150 --> 07:41.413
Charcala,

07:31.150 --> 07:41.413
which I didn't like. I don't mean it. I didn't like 
him. I liked being around Dr. Coles. I don't blame

07:46.849 --> 07:47.470
him. I'd have shed a stir if I could have. When he had 
a staff meeting, did you meet with the other people

07:50.054 --> 07:55.643
that reported to him? Anytime Dr. Coles had a 
meeting, we all met. Give this description a

08:00.411 --> 08:08.143
sample of the kinds of problems, big and small, 
that campus security had to deal with. Well, the

08:09.727 --> 08:13.612
big problem, of course, again, was the traffic 
problem. The police hated it. And they were all

08:17.237 --> 08:19.040
commissioned policemen. They didn't think it was 
their job. And they were writing their tickets and

08:20.402 --> 08:23.426
listening to the hassle. And really, it was a real 
hassle. As far as security of the university was

08:26.811 --> 08:31.137
concerned, there weren't many problems. We'd had 
a few break-ins and damages here and there. very

08:34.938 --> 08:42.186
rare, once in a while there was a bomb threat, but 
not more than half a dozen times during my tenure.

08:44.048 --> 08:51.437
We just, mostly it was the animosity towards us 
that made it a different job to have. And it was

08:52.378 --> 08:56.082
really not fair, but I can understand it. And like 
when I come to camp, I don't have any place to park.

09:00.723 --> 09:01.844
I'd go pay for it. The police at that time weren't 
paying for a parking permit. I said, no way. If

09:09.473 --> 09:16.120
everybody else on campus is paying, you're going 
to pay if you want to bring your car in here to work.

09:16.480 --> 09:17.641
That caused a hassle. They had one of the sergeants 
that was afraid He wouldn't work at night because

09:23.774 --> 09:28.398
he was afraid of the dark, I guess, or something. 
And we put him on shift. If you don't like the shift,

09:30.360 --> 09:33.123
out you go. And he said, well, you know, I can be on 
the day shift and the other one. I said, well,

09:37.587 --> 09:40.149
shifts are going to be rotated every month. And if 
somebody wants a swap shift, as long as the chief

09:41.090 --> 09:45.974
agrees, that's all right. But, oh, and also Chief 
Luther, well, Luther, wouldn't put women on duty

09:52.512 --> 09:54.515
at night. And I said, why not? They're police 
officers and they wanted to. And so we put women on

10:00.323 --> 10:02.206
duty. I mean, if they're going to be a policeman, 
they're going to be a policeman. So, you know,

10:05.330 --> 10:10.397
there was, there were a lot of little things like 
that that were going on in there. You know, you got

10:11.819 --> 10:15.464
to treat everybody what the job demands. Now we, 
during your years, we didn't have any major

10:16.045 --> 10:20.832
problem like murders. Well, we had, you know, one 
person was killed over in the chapel, one student,

10:21.233 --> 10:32.978
but they knew who it was. No major fires other than 
the board room that I know of, or the board house.

10:39.391 --> 10:40.454
But that was an accident. Right. We had a couple of 
of reported rapes and that we were able to show that

10:42.614 --> 10:50.109
there was not a rape. Once in a while, a fight would 
break out and I could go take care of it. No weapons

10:57.904 --> 10:59.146
problems. We had a lot of drug problems. And what 
drugs primarily was it? Oh, mostly marijuana,

11:05.667 --> 11:10.553
although once in a while you'd have a heroin. And 
the marijuana, I didn't know what marijuana

11:11.715 --> 11:19.785
smelled like, you know. But I, when I went through 
the police academy, that's one of the things you

11:20.406 --> 11:25.412
got to, experience and I smoked a marijuana 
cigarette to experience what the smell was. I

11:34.021 --> 11:38.906
didn't get any effect from it, I don't know, but 
anyway, that sort of stuff. As far as y'all were

11:38.926 --> 11:42.990
aware, where was the marijuana coming from? What 
was the source? I don't know. I don't know where it

11:46.213 --> 11:48.475
was, why it was. Don't know who the... And any 
heroin, cocaine, any I don't know of any ties with

11:55.852 --> 12:04.583
the drug, but Bob White probably, he might have 
known some of those things because he was in that

11:55.852 --> 12:04.583
business. Well, and I'll bet it's a lot worse now 
than it was then. Do you remember any goofy, funny,

12:09.409 --> 12:13.755
silly things that y'all coped with? Not really. I 
know it's not really funny because it's sad, but my

12:18.177 --> 12:28.452
youngest son got hooked on drugs, and he was a 
student and married. They brought him in one night

12:29.513 --> 12:32.598
and called me at home about 2 o'clock in the 
morning. I came over there, and he was still pretty

12:32.658 --> 12:36.383
high on whatever he was on. And he starts cussing 
me, and I told him, you're not going to ever say that

12:36.443 --> 12:43.233
to me again. And he did it again. There was a 
policeman there with me, and I hauled off and

12:44.575 --> 12:47.880
knocked him on his butt. And the policeman said, 
don't do that, you're a policeman, you're a

12:48.552 --> 12:51.476
policeman. I said, get the hell out of here, I'm his 
father. And anyway, he secured a scar with him the

12:54.300 --> 13:01.029
rest of his life up there, but he remembered that it 
was wrong. But that wasn't funny, though. It was

13:03.372 --> 13:04.653
just a sad thing. And police business is not a fun 
thing. I admire people. Like Elmer Snyder, they

13:10.861 --> 13:16.288
got a jewel there. Did anybody ever try to twist the 
arm of the campus police to get you to do something?

13:22.797 --> 13:24.820
Well, I was working. A lot of times I'd help them out 
at the front when we had these massive crowds. And

13:29.026 --> 13:34.273
there was one of these, I don't even know what 
country he was from. He was not U.S. But he comes in

13:37.558 --> 13:39.400
once one of those, parking lots where you have a 
number. I said, you can't have one. Well, what do

13:44.247 --> 13:45.209
they cost? And I said, it doesn't matter what they 
cost, you can't have one. And he pulled out his

13:48.716 --> 13:54.127
billfold and started putting $100, how much are 
they? $100 bills down. And I said, hold on a second.

13:57.026 --> 14:01.394
I pulled out my badge and I said, now what was it you 
were saying? Because I'd arrested him then, but I

14:02.015 --> 14:06.202
didn't want to do it at that time. And he said, well, 
I'll just have to look somewhere else. So he left.

14:10.650 --> 14:14.196
But that actually happened. Did any regent or 
former student or legislator ever tell you? Oh,

14:21.111 --> 14:22.533
not the big guys. The regents were nice people. Of 
course, we always took care of them, too, in the

14:24.897 --> 14:29.825
boardroom when they had that number one plaque. 
But people were always trying to get you to take

14:30.486 --> 14:40.302
care of their tickets or the car was towed or one 
thing or another. The only thing I told him, I said,

14:40.805 --> 14:45.952
my son's gotten a couple of tickets, and he paid 
them. I didn't ultimately pay them, but my wife got

14:46.573 --> 14:50.458
two or three, and she paid them. And that's the only 
way you can operate. You just can't do anything

14:52.520 --> 14:56.225
else. Did you ever get any calls from somebody 
trying to get you to let their son go? Well, I guess,

15:00.391 --> 15:08.922
let's see, Gus Majalis, Gus's son was a student 
here, and it was a petty thing, but he picked up a

15:09.273 --> 15:19.342
passbook, I guess a student book with football 
tickets in it, and didn't turn it in. And it was

15:20.123 --> 15:22.365
pretty easy to find out who it belonged to. It was in 
the reserve section over there, and they found

15:22.385 --> 15:30.313
him, and we were taken down to JP like everybody 
else. We didn't get to the JP. It was taken care of

15:32.495 --> 15:34.036
before we got there. But I didn't know that they had 
a direct line through Maddox. Mm. Maddox was the

15:39.328 --> 15:41.950
land where the athletic department. Mm. And, you 
know, we, I, every coach I went to, and I said, if

15:42.911 --> 15:53.341
Fort Lauderdale football coaches, players are 
the same as any other student, and we're going to

15:42.911 --> 15:53.341
treat them the same. It didn't happen that way. And 
before we tried to, before we got to J.P. with them,

15:55.563 --> 16:02.570
it was taken care of, and Maddox was telling them 
about it. And, I mean, I hope it didn't happen to

16:02.590 --> 16:07.554
now. I don't think it is. When the old board house 
burned, how did you hear about that fire? Well,

16:17.557 --> 16:18.758
they called me at home. Do you remember who called? 
Oh, the police. I was the policeman. They called

16:23.563 --> 16:26.907
me, and I jumped in the truck and headed out. And it 
was, you know, of course, still burning when I got

16:28.188 --> 16:33.794
here. And thank goodness no one was injured, were 
they? No, no. You know, the college station pilot

16:37.833 --> 16:41.578
was probably one of the best. And, of course, that 
thing was fully engulfed, too. By the time I got

16:45.363 --> 16:47.687
there, I don't know what all happened. I know that, 
of course, I saw Dr. Miller's room, and they were

16:47.707 --> 16:55.597
very distraught, and, you know, just terrible 
life for them. And Dr. Miller served until 1980.

17:00.084 --> 17:03.528
Dr. Vandiver, yeah. And then Dr. Vandiver... What 
was it like reporting to him? Well, I never had much

17:09.060 --> 17:16.963
direct conversation with him, but I disagreed 
with him. You know, he wanted some guns, pistol.

17:20.999 --> 17:27.548
And the police get a special price, and they wanted 
the police price, and I told them no. I told the

17:27.788 --> 17:37.821
chief that, well, he got his guns, and he turned 
them in after all the trouble, and he came up and

17:27.788 --> 17:37.821
told them, well, here's your damn guns. But the 
money that was paid for them came from former

17:38.802 --> 17:43.108
students. He wanted somebody to, he wanted a 
police radio in his car, which I guess was all

17:43.088 --> 17:50.378
right. The only thing is he used it for a lot more 
than that, to call my wife and tell her to do so and

17:50.418 --> 17:57.829
so, and that sort of stuff, which is kind of gauzy. 
Little things like that were, I guess he somehow

17:59.171 --> 18:06.261
admired police people, and he used to, McDonald 
used to take him out to the range and he'd shoot his

18:06.865 --> 18:11.030
pistol out there and that sort of stuff. He was 
having some problems with her former husband, and

18:13.433 --> 18:26.088
I walked around his house several nights, two or 
three hours, looking for suspicious characters

18:13.433 --> 18:26.088
that were out there. We'd get phone calls that 
somebody was running across that path. That was a

18:29.391 --> 18:30.713
jogging path. But nevertheless, we'd go out 
there, and I went out to a little theft place that's

18:31.165 --> 18:38.696
over there, and wandered around for three hours, 
never saw anything. But, and we were getting those

18:38.716 --> 18:43.123
same phone calls, threatening calls. And during 
all of your years, we never had a serious theft

18:44.225 --> 18:50.214
problem here on the campus, did we? Not there. As 
far as you knew, How did A&M as a campus, in terms of

18:54.689 --> 19:07.042
law enforcement, how did it compare with, in crime 
rate, compared to other universities? Well, the

19:07.643 --> 19:16.031
larger universities like UT and University of 
Houston and so forth, we knew pretty much about

19:07.643 --> 19:16.031
them because we all were having an association. 
They didn't have traffic. They were police. And

19:19.855 --> 19:21.777
they were totally different problems. These 
smaller universities were combined. A&M was just

19:24.693 --> 19:28.637
too big for that type of operation. So we couldn't 
compare with them. And you can't compare with the

19:31.920 --> 19:35.043
quality. You train them and somebody else will 
hire them because they don't like it. And I mean, it

19:38.787 --> 19:42.370
costs a lot to train these guys and put them in the 
uniform. And by the time you get them in the

19:43.091 --> 19:46.674
uniform, you've already spent several thousand 
dollars. And then they're very employable

19:46.754 --> 19:52.060
because they're the high turnover of police 
people. Brian College Station hired a bunch of our

19:52.540 --> 19:54.582
people. And generally, where did our university 
police, what was their background? Where did they

20:01.575 --> 20:02.476
come from? Well,

20:02.516 --> 20:07.926
young guys out looking for a job. Most of them were 
not college people. And were they professionally

20:11.191 --> 20:13.195
trained police? Well, no, we got very few that were 
already certified. We had to send them to school.

20:19.604 --> 20:22.647
And then quite often they got hired away by some of 
them. Most of the time. By the time you invest in

20:23.028 --> 20:31.617
uniforms for them and training and everything, 
because we didn't pay them as much when they were in

20:23.028 --> 20:31.617
school as we did when they were certified. And as 
soon as they were certified, the same way that

20:31.777 --> 20:39.085
Brian in college, they'd yank them off for $1,000 
more or something like that. You can't blame the

20:39.105 --> 20:40.907
guys, but that's what happened. So I gather in 
comparison of the two tasks you had here, being

20:41.968 --> 20:47.615
commandant was more satisfying. Oh, it was a fun 
job. And more enjoyable. And so you left the second

20:53.320 --> 20:59.168
task in 1980. 83. 83.

21:03.093 --> 21:07.159
And you left at a time when you decided. Yes, I 
volunteered. Although, frankly, I could see the

21:10.203 --> 21:18.754
handwriting on the wall because I think they were 
ready for a change over there and a couple of should

21:10.203 --> 21:18.754
have been made. I made a mistake, like I said 
before. I should not have put Russell McDonald in

21:22.073 --> 21:28.320
the job, and I should have moved him out of there, 
and I didn't. All right. As yesterday, if you were

21:29.621 --> 21:39.331
offering advice to people today about what the 
commandant should do, what advice would you give

21:29.621 --> 21:39.331
them? Well, it looks to me like he's got the best of 
both worlds now. He's got financial aid, and that

21:45.157 --> 21:48.741
was a big problem. And he's got a staff that makes me 
very envious. They're all good people. They're

21:55.139 --> 21:59.285
all falling over 98% Aggie, maybe 100. And they all 
are military oriented. And the ROTC business,

22:02.510 --> 22:06.617
they've got it great, too. All they've got to worry 
about is their class. So I think his biggest

22:09.221 --> 22:13.868
problem is recruiting and retention. And with the 
scholarship program and the shortage of space and

22:14.438 --> 22:19.926
everything, I think recruiting must not be too 
difficult. And would you always have the

22:21.108 --> 22:28.238
Commandant be a former Aggie student? I would like 
for him to be, if I had any choice. What about branch

22:31.022 --> 22:32.684
of service? Doesn't matter. Doesn't matter? The 
Commandant's supposed to be not prejudiced. You

22:37.892 --> 22:42.218
can help with a little service bias, but I don't 
think it matters. General Darling, I thought he

22:42.400 --> 22:44.883
did a great job. And General Hopgood, he's been 
very good to me. About how long would you have the

22:51.210 --> 22:54.273
commandant serve? I think five or six years is 
enough. Just like presidents of universities,

22:58.318 --> 23:05.386
there's a time when you get pretty stale in the job. 
It's really the same thing over and over and over.

23:08.990 --> 23:12.053
More so in the corps probably than in the academia. 
What about advising about police and that task?

23:17.845 --> 23:22.591
What advice would you give there to the decision 
makers? Oh, I wouldn't be, I'm not near as

23:22.611 --> 23:30.582
professional in the policemen as Bob Wildman. 
Elmer Snyder is my closest friend here now, and I

23:30.899 --> 23:46.922
spent a lot of time with him, and Elmer, he really 
works hard at that job, and Bob, I like Bob a lot, but

23:30.899 --> 23:46.922
I wish he'd retire. It's time for him to retire, 
because Elmer's doing the job, and it wouldn't

23:47.443 --> 23:54.713
matter, he'll still do the job either way, but But 
they've got a fantastic organization, and those

23:55.537 --> 24:01.808
guys have got to have at least two years of college. 
And they're not friendly. When you see them on the

24:07.558 --> 24:16.994
campus, they don't speak or anything like that, 
which I think is kind of wrong, because you don't

24:07.558 --> 24:16.994
need to walk around like I'm a policeman. Don't 
mess with me. And I see that. And I noticed it myself

24:22.020 --> 24:23.923
just this morning. I spoke to a couple of them and 
got ignored. But I speak to a lot of the people I

24:26.627 --> 24:29.992
didn't get ignored to. And like you were telling 
me, I've been noticing the girls, they smile and

24:30.012 --> 24:33.938
speak to you. And that makes me feel good. Looking 
over those years and both tasks, what were your

24:37.783 --> 24:43.271
happiest, proudest moments? Well, one of them was 
this thing right here. which I see you're wearing,

24:48.743 --> 24:51.707
too. And I know that... As a note to the machine, he 
pointed to the watch for the Distinguished

24:51.727 --> 25:06.086
Service Award, and in his case was for University 
Service. It's really Student Relations. Student

25:08.690 --> 25:10.031
Relations Award, yes. There's one a year. And I 
know that there were people that objected to a

25:11.814 --> 25:18.042
military force from getting it. And I didn't even 
know who some of them were, which is fine. I was

25:22.845 --> 25:25.748
surprised and everything else. But I was very 
proud of the guys in the student body that I know who

25:26.609 --> 25:33.617
were behind my getting this thing. And they're 
pretty influential people in Washington right

25:33.677 --> 25:39.323
now, as you know who one of them is. But it really was 
an unexpected thing. And also, it will never

25:44.735 --> 25:52.326
happen again to an active duty military officer 
because you've got to have five years of the

25:44.735 --> 25:52.326
university. And I don't think that's going to ever 
happen again. So I had the longest tenure of any

25:55.571 --> 26:01.140
military active duty person. Other proud 
moments, happy moments? Well, the Carroll time,

26:07.068 --> 26:11.535
of course, was a very proud moment for me. I was very 
proud when, I guess, when Judy graduated. She had

26:20.320 --> 26:23.323
never been to college, never hoped to go. She was 
scared to death. I told her when I went to work for

26:26.406 --> 26:33.654
the University Police, I said, okay, I haven't had 
time to do anything else and I want you to go to

26:26.406 --> 26:33.654
college. And I carried her around to some of the 
profs And they said, you can do it. Don't worry.

26:39.904 --> 26:44.709
Well, I don't remember much and whatever, but 
anyway, she just needed it. Now, this is your

26:44.729 --> 26:46.330
daughter? No, I'm the only person you know who's 
been married three times and never divorced. Oh,

26:51.916 --> 26:52.276
oh, oh. My second wife. Oh, oh, that's right. 
That's right. I'm sorry. Yes, yes. And Judy, she

26:55.420 --> 27:02.106
graduated cum laude in industrial ed. And I was 
very proud of that.

27:07.490 --> 27:10.934
At the same time, we still had three boys at home, 
too, and I don't know how she did it. Of course, I was

27:12.236 --> 27:20.106
proud when my son graduated, and when I married 
again, I was very proud. Carlos, he'll be there

27:20.126 --> 27:28.417
tonight, and he's an Aggie all the way through. I'm 
very proud of what he's going to do now and be a

27:28.437 --> 27:32.782
nurse. I think that's a good application. And of 
course this thing here was a... The petition, yes.

27:41.836 --> 27:46.003
That was a very moving thing for me. Of all the 
presidents that you observed, to which ones would

27:46.684 --> 27:52.735
you give the highest Well, of course, Dr. Williams 
is the one that I knew the most and really knew him

27:53.255 --> 28:07.251
well, as well as you can know him in that 
relationship, not in a personal relationship.

28:08.072 --> 28:17.362
But I didn't have much personal dealings with Dr. 
Miller or Dr. Vander, but Dr. Williams almost on a

28:08.072 --> 28:17.362
daily basis. And are there some If you were writing 
a list of people to whom you feel deepest gratitude

28:23.748 --> 28:30.038
connected with A&M, who would that be? Well, of 
course, Buck, not around anymore, Buck Wirus.

28:37.069 --> 28:38.311
Buck Wirus, oh. And because he was very supportive 
of me and the Corps. And again, Dr. Williams and

28:43.458 --> 28:47.302
John DeColtis were supportive. And, you know, all 
over the campus, most of the faculty were very,

28:48.303 --> 28:53.890
very supportive. I'm sure there were some that 
didn't like it. I know they hated like hell having

28:57.093 --> 29:02.159
us on the faculty council or whatever it is. Heck, 
we didn't want to be there anyway. But we felt like

29:05.343 --> 29:09.988
we better be there because voting on things, I 
didn't know what they were talking about. There's

29:10.492 --> 29:15.862
just so many good things that happened in the 
world. It's hard to say. All right, now I've run out

29:16.723 --> 29:19.108
of questions. What else have we not covered from? 
Yes, I don't know. I think we've covered about

29:22.153 --> 29:25.620
everything I can think of. Well, let's end then 
with what do you think about A&M's future? Well, it

29:31.805 --> 29:36.010
looks awfully bright to me, I think, 
educationally. And what I'm glad of is that the

29:36.030 --> 29:40.776
students haven't changed. They're the same good 
people. And the campus is so different from any

29:44.080 --> 29:48.905
other place I've ever been. I haven't spent much 
time on university campuses, but I did spend two

29:49.005 --> 29:53.991
years at Boston College. And there's no 
difference from those people back then, even. But

29:58.216 --> 30:01.440
I think we're just going to be We're going to stay on 
the top. We may not be a Harvard or a Yale, but I'd

30:03.767 --> 30:09.780
rather be from here than Harvard or Yale. I don't 
think our education is any less than what they get.

30:13.467 --> 30:15.071
They just get a better name, maybe. But I do want it 
to not grow much bigger, though. That's a good

30:22.025 --> 30:22.787
thing.
