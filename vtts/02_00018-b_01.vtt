WEBVTT

00:00:04.435 --> 00:00:05.416
was the worst?

00:00:07.960 --> 00:00:13.627
Out of the blue would come a request.

00:00:13.647 --> 00:00:18.314
Got to have $2,000 for a piece of machinery here that broke down.

00:00:18.334 --> 00:00:22.539
Otherwise, we'll endanger a half a million dollars worth of research.

00:00:22.559 --> 00:00:24.041
So I'm OK, fine.

00:00:24.061 --> 00:00:26.625
I sent them over $2,000.

00:00:26.645 --> 00:00:31.371
At the end of the year, when we had turned in a report from the Coordinating Board,

00:00:32.397 --> 00:00:37.884
especially to the legislature.

00:00:37.904 --> 00:00:42.630
I called up Al Cotton and I said, Al, remember the $2,000?

00:00:42.650 --> 00:00:51.883
Can you write something to tell the people of the state how you used that money?

00:00:51.903 --> 00:00:53.625
And he said, oh, I couldn't have known.

00:00:53.645 --> 00:00:56.008
You know, that was really irritating.

00:00:59.971 --> 00:01:03.676
That's the science, at least you mentioned.

00:01:05.339 --> 00:01:06.020
Chemistry.

00:01:09.765 --> 00:01:11.347
What about vet medicine?

00:01:13.010 --> 00:01:17.917
Good, good relationship.

00:01:17.937 --> 00:01:18.337
Al Price, Greek guy.

00:01:18.357 --> 00:01:21.442
And did that change with George Shelton when he came?

00:01:25.427 --> 00:01:28.712
I was probably dealing less and less over the years with vet medicine.

00:01:29.587 --> 00:01:35.674
And so I knew Al Price and Shelton just as members of the research committee.

00:01:35.694 --> 00:01:36.535
What about science?

00:01:37.556 --> 00:01:41.901
Science, that was a tough one to do.

00:01:41.921 --> 00:01:47.387
The MD Anderson people wanted to come up and irradiate people in the psychotron.

00:01:47.407 --> 00:01:51.331
And they had to do it at certain times and so on.

00:01:51.351 --> 00:01:56.657
And many of the experiments done in the psychotron, in physics and chemistry,

00:01:57.380 --> 00:02:02.066
required 48 to 72 hours, because it's a statistical thing.

00:02:02.086 --> 00:02:11.799
You've got to gather all the players that you see, and then see whether they make any sense of it.

00:02:11.819 --> 00:02:22.833
And so it was really an inconvenience for the science people to have MD Anderson take up some time for patients.

00:02:22.853 --> 00:02:26.458
I became the coordinator.

00:02:27.265 --> 00:02:39.161
trying to coordinate the business.

00:02:40.703 --> 00:02:45.809
The doctors, the medical doctors would be an arrogant bunch.

00:02:45.829 --> 00:02:51.076
They thought there was no higher calling than to try to save lives.

00:02:51.096 --> 00:02:52.959
Please make dying a little less traumatic.

00:02:52.979 --> 00:02:54.100
And of course, we are a typical, arrogant,

00:02:55.278 --> 00:03:00.987
I'd ask him, you know, could you write me something to explain to the legislature what you did?

00:03:01.367 --> 00:03:02.489
Oh, I never could do it.

00:03:02.509 --> 00:03:03.871
They never would understand.

00:03:03.891 --> 00:03:04.953
I can't do it.

00:03:06.636 --> 00:03:16.711
Those two guys sitting across the table with other representatives, you know, every time we had a meeting, a scheduling meeting, they were glaring at each other.

00:03:16.731 --> 00:03:19.075
But after about a year of these meetings,

00:03:19.628 --> 00:03:42.058
As you look back on those years do you remember any key

00:03:44.249 --> 00:04:05.633
research decisions that made here on the campus either by an individual or an organization that you can see in hindsight those were important a direction for it to go an area of emphasis

00:04:09.123 --> 00:04:15.492
All that contact research ended in 1983.

00:04:15.512 --> 00:04:16.293
I don't think of it anymore.

00:04:16.373 --> 00:04:17.594
All right.

00:04:17.614 --> 00:04:25.685
What about any big research contractor grant that proved to be significant?

00:04:25.705 --> 00:04:29.470
Well, again, there's probably many of them.

00:04:30.892 --> 00:04:32.194
I could have rattled off 13, 15 years ago.

00:04:35.465 --> 00:04:45.637
All right, you came back then to the department in 83, and you had been away then for a good while.

00:04:46.097 --> 00:04:48.160
Had the department grown in your absence?

00:04:49.882 --> 00:04:56.309
No, the department was quite stable.

00:04:56.329 --> 00:05:00.834
We had hires that we discouraged because there were people in and out for some of the years.

00:05:00.854 --> 00:05:01.675
It really hadn't changed much.

00:05:03.511 --> 00:05:12.821
And today, as far as you know, what is the size of the department in terms of faculty?

00:05:14.663 --> 00:05:21.971
It's probably decreased a little bit because we've had seven or eight retirements in the last five or six years.

00:05:23.613 --> 00:05:28.759
And they made the decision.

00:05:28.779 --> 00:05:32.623
I guess they'll look at what's made the decision probably.

00:05:33.295 --> 00:05:41.187
I agree with you.

00:05:43.190 --> 00:05:52.485
That doesn't build a reputation.

00:05:53.613 --> 00:06:06.084
We've got the 10-year review and that sort of thing.

00:06:06.104 --> 00:06:06.604
It's going to take years.

00:06:06.624 --> 00:06:06.784
Oh, yes.

00:06:06.804 --> 00:06:07.765
Fortunately, some of them have turned out great.

00:06:07.785 --> 00:06:08.226
There's no guarantee.

00:06:08.506 --> 00:06:22.658
As you look back on these 30 years, who do you think nationally would be the most recognized geologist here in your 30 years, other than yourself?

00:06:25.810 --> 00:06:28.092
Well, John Handler.

00:06:28.152 --> 00:06:29.013
He had a tremendous reputation.

00:06:29.674 --> 00:06:30.875
What was his specialty?

00:06:30.895 --> 00:06:31.856
The rock mechanics.

00:06:31.876 --> 00:06:35.179
He was the leader of the rock mechanics group.

00:06:35.199 --> 00:06:37.361
He never did any of the work.

00:06:37.381 --> 00:06:39.643
He raised the money.

00:06:39.663 --> 00:06:42.065
But his name went on everything.

00:06:42.085 --> 00:06:49.492
So he would be thought of as the pioneer of geological rock mechanics and so on.

00:06:49.512 --> 00:06:49.953
Who else?

00:06:53.216 --> 00:06:55.378
Well, I don't think there is anybody.

00:06:58.497 --> 00:07:07.414
If we were to poll geology major undergraduates down in the last 30 years, who would they say were the best teachers?

00:07:11.321 --> 00:07:11.582
Travis Clark.

00:07:11.602 --> 00:07:14.547
What courses did Travis teach?

00:07:14.687 --> 00:07:18.715
Oh, he taught petroleum geology years ago.

00:07:18.735 --> 00:07:19.376
Taught them how to contour maps.

00:07:19.396 --> 00:07:19.797
That sounds like it.

00:07:25.497 --> 00:07:28.681
and exercise it, not very rewarding.

00:07:28.701 --> 00:07:39.615
But it taught these kids to look at the detail and be very careful and make recommendations based only on what they could see and bring.

00:07:39.635 --> 00:07:42.659
So he was a good teacher.

00:07:42.699 --> 00:07:43.860
Were there other key teachers?

00:07:44.782 --> 00:07:46.884
Fred Smith was a good teacher.

00:07:46.904 --> 00:07:53.933
I had that rapport with the freshmen, finally, after they got to be about 20 years old.

00:07:53.953 --> 00:07:55.335
They realized Fred was...

00:07:56.345 --> 00:08:10.182
In your own case, which of your discoveries, publications are you most proud?

00:08:15.269 --> 00:08:25.141
Well, frankly, I have a couple of landmark papers, some which I did when I was still in the industry.

00:08:25.161 --> 00:08:25.221
And

00:08:25.808 --> 00:08:35.222
There's still another one which I wrote in 1975 on capillary pressures.

00:08:35.242 --> 00:08:38.286
That's another one that's still being referenced.

00:08:38.306 --> 00:08:39.268
Now, what was the first one?

00:08:39.288 --> 00:08:40.430
You didn't mention it by name.

00:08:42.272 --> 00:08:47.079
Mountain plank structure in Wyoming.

00:08:47.099 --> 00:08:53.729
And I think about every 10 years I turned out something that was really important.

00:08:53.769 --> 00:08:54.330
I published it.

00:08:54.952 --> 00:09:23.322
nationally today uh... where would our program in geology be right do you have any idea

00:09:23.858 --> 00:09:31.812
Harvard will always be thought of as the top school in anything.

00:09:31.832 --> 00:09:43.653
And that's because most of the PhDs turned out up to about 20, 25 years before Harvard PhDs or Princeton or something.

00:09:43.774 --> 00:09:48.482
And a lot of those rankings, I don't think, makes any sense at all.

00:09:49.559 --> 00:09:53.945
Who else in the nation is strong in rock mechanics?

00:09:55.688 --> 00:09:57.911
Nobody now.

00:09:57.931 --> 00:09:58.312
So we're...

00:09:58.332 --> 00:09:59.614
They kind of gave it up.

00:09:59.634 --> 00:09:59.954
Okay.

00:10:00.695 --> 00:10:01.777
The thing fell apart.

00:10:01.877 --> 00:10:06.664
The reason it did was it got popular and everybody started squeezing rocks themselves.

00:10:07.685 --> 00:10:09.488
The reason is he ran out of ideas.

00:10:11.170 --> 00:10:14.736
They didn't have theoreticians.

00:10:15.537 --> 00:10:17.019
This is what they needed.

00:10:17.039 --> 00:10:17.760
Looking back on it.

00:10:18.078 --> 00:10:36.759
Tony and I talk about this all the time.

00:10:37.800 --> 00:10:41.544
What you need to have a successful program in science of any type, you've got to have at least one theoretician that does nothing but sit and think and say, now this is what we should do.

00:10:41.564 --> 00:10:43.967
On the other hand, tectonophysics, to put it crudely, first they squeeze blocks of rock.

00:10:44.605 --> 00:11:09.639
Looking back over these 30 years, can you think of any direction A&M might have gone to add to its reputation that it did not?

00:11:11.161 --> 00:11:13.785
Was there an opportunity there that we might have missed?

00:11:14.997 --> 00:11:16.199
Well, you can't do everything.

00:11:16.539 --> 00:11:17.060
No, I know.

00:11:17.581 --> 00:11:23.931
And so I think that it comes down ultimately to the rural group.

00:11:23.951 --> 00:11:28.919
We wanted a strong structural geology, rock mechanics.

00:11:28.939 --> 00:11:32.905
We wanted strength in petroleum and engineering geology.

00:11:33.005 --> 00:11:35.149
Those three.

00:11:35.169 --> 00:11:37.412
We've got a couple of geochemists around, too.

00:11:37.533 --> 00:11:39.175
They're good people.

00:11:39.195 --> 00:11:41.038
But you can't make a...

00:11:41.390 --> 00:12:01.973
If I were today interested in studying rock mechanics and for some reason I didn't come to A&M, where else would I be best advised to go?

00:12:03.495 --> 00:12:08.540
Well, you'd have to look up in the literature to see if you should go.

00:12:08.560 --> 00:12:11.143
In graduate school, I think you should go

00:12:12.895 --> 00:12:40.934
My own school, the University of Minnesota, has been this way for about 30 years now.

00:12:40.954 --> 00:12:42.396
They don't go out in the field anymore.

00:12:43.102 --> 00:12:58.077
And in 1972 I was on a lecture tour and I stopped in Minnesota and gave the lecture, and it was unresolved.

00:12:58.157 --> 00:13:10.189
And after my lecture a few people hung around and they drifted off and finally two had been waiting very patiently to talk to me.

00:13:10.591 --> 00:13:28.313
All right, now there's an area of emphasis.

00:13:29.069 --> 00:13:34.358
Are you, you believe that A&M should emphasize the practical?

00:13:35.120 --> 00:13:35.420
Oh, yes.

00:13:35.440 --> 00:13:35.721
Okay.

00:13:38.265 --> 00:13:43.534
Are there some others that are emphasizing the practical around the country also?

00:13:44.536 --> 00:13:53.352
Well, Colorado School of Mines.

00:13:53.372 --> 00:13:53.472
Okay.

00:13:53.492 --> 00:13:53.592
Okay.

00:13:56.052 --> 00:14:04.160
And I'm assuming that the schools that have a strong petroleum engineering program might likely have a...

00:14:05.721 --> 00:14:06.963
But not necessarily.

00:14:06.983 --> 00:14:07.683
Not necessarily.

00:14:07.703 --> 00:14:07.923
Okay.

00:14:08.184 --> 00:14:08.544
Okay.

00:14:09.785 --> 00:14:14.470
Engineers don't often realize that rocks are their problem.

00:14:14.490 --> 00:14:15.851
And what are you working on these days?

00:14:17.993 --> 00:14:18.814
Stuff like that.

00:14:18.834 --> 00:14:18.934
Okay.

00:14:18.954 --> 00:14:23.038
How oil gets out of the source rock and migrates into the factory from which it can produce it.

00:14:23.677 --> 00:14:26.741
And primarily in this region of the world.

00:14:29.805 --> 00:14:44.283
And so back to your coming here.

00:14:45.986 --> 00:14:46.326
You.

00:14:49.462 --> 00:14:57.492
where you had never visited A&M before the job opportunity came.

00:14:57.532 --> 00:15:08.405
And the associate dean, when he called, he knew you by reputation, but not personally.

00:15:10.067 --> 00:15:11.509
And there was not a search committee.

00:15:14.312 --> 00:15:14.372
No.

00:15:15.280 --> 00:15:19.589
What was your impression of the community as a place to live?

00:15:19.609 --> 00:15:25.803
It was tough.

00:15:25.823 --> 00:15:28.328
We had to cross the risky bridge.

00:15:30.822 --> 00:15:31.283
No, let's see.

00:15:31.303 --> 00:15:33.607
You all lived in College Station or Bryan?

00:15:33.627 --> 00:15:34.048
In Bryan.

00:15:34.528 --> 00:15:34.949
In Bryan.

00:15:36.091 --> 00:15:38.896
And your first housing?

00:15:39.858 --> 00:15:42.422
Chicken fried steak.

00:15:42.442 --> 00:15:43.063
There you go.

00:15:44.445 --> 00:15:48.933
The finest place you could go outside of the Briarcrest Country.

00:15:48.953 --> 00:15:52.099
And what did you all rent when you first?

00:15:52.239 --> 00:15:53.100
We rented for a year.

00:15:53.220 --> 00:15:54.062
And what did it cost?

00:15:54.082 --> 00:15:54.703
Do you remember?

00:15:57.367 --> 00:16:00.351
Ours was $85 a month.

00:16:00.372 --> 00:16:06.140
We rented a house in 1959.

00:16:06.341 --> 00:16:10.907
We bought our house on Brookside there for $22,000.

00:16:10.947 --> 00:16:13.491
It was owned by Bill Roman.

00:16:14.693 --> 00:16:25.109
It had been built by a professor of English by the name of Middleton.

00:16:25.129 --> 00:16:26.631
Have you ever known him?

00:16:27.657 --> 00:16:28.378
Just a name.

00:16:36.969 --> 00:16:55.352
Your annual.

00:16:57.965 --> 00:17:05.655
But I'll bet you could probably make a profit on selling it today.

00:17:07.637 --> 00:17:09.720
Yes, yes.

00:17:11.122 --> 00:17:18.651
Now, did you, as a non-Texan, did you have any trouble feeling accepted?

00:17:20.053 --> 00:17:21.896
No, I didn't.

00:17:21.916 --> 00:17:25.440
The reason is my sister, who's 10 years older than I am,

00:17:27.175 --> 00:17:29.959
I got married and moved to Houston in 1939.

00:17:32.303 --> 00:17:37.511
I frequently visited down there, so I knew something about Houston.

00:17:38.673 --> 00:17:54.617
I knew how to pronounce T-U-A-M. That's T-U-A-M. My brother-in-law was

00:17:54.952 --> 00:17:58.656
He was sort of a self-taught metalurgist.

00:17:58.676 --> 00:18:12.010
He finished all the course work with the film engineer, and he and a friend of his, they first started out reclaiming motor oil.

00:18:12.030 --> 00:18:13.952
This was in the early 30s.

00:18:13.972 --> 00:18:19.558
And as you can imagine, finally their laboratory, which was in a garage, burned down.

00:18:19.876 --> 00:18:30.013
And so they moved to Houston, and they got into the heat treating business, which was a tremendous business in those days, because pump liners were all well punched.

00:18:30.934 --> 00:18:35.502
They were always being scored by the sand that was going up.

00:18:35.522 --> 00:18:42.053
So you had to go heat treat and re-fit your pump liners and all that in a couple weeks.

00:18:42.826 --> 00:19:01.206
So the first house that they bought outside of that area.

00:19:01.523 --> 00:19:08.730
It was way out in the country by the University of Houston.

00:19:09.590 --> 00:19:10.051
Well, let's see.

00:19:10.091 --> 00:19:12.093
Let's draw this to a conclusion.

00:19:12.373 --> 00:19:26.686
As you look back on these years at A&M, how would you describe the progress that this institution has made in the last 30 years?

00:19:29.789 --> 00:19:30.349
Oh, I think it's tremendous.

00:19:30.369 --> 00:19:30.990
A&M is where it is.

00:19:31.426 --> 00:19:48.031
Let's quit on that.

00:19:49.954 --> 00:19:51.076
Thank you.

00:19:51.096 --> 00:19:57.105
...were purchased with the income from this modest endowment.

00:19:59.128 --> 00:20:00.690
Again, my appreciation.

00:20:01.413 --> 00:20:09.561
Paragraph, again, my appreciation for the honor I feel in being able to serve with you on the Schreiner, at Schreiner.

00:20:10.262 --> 00:20:11.323
Sincerely, end of letter.

00:20:13.445 --> 00:20:18.991
The achievement of its graduates.

00:20:20.192 --> 00:20:29.361
Paragraph, the true measurement of Austin College quality is not

00:20:31.366 --> 00:20:50.932
ACT scores, top 10% of high school class rank, but the level of achievement which its graduates make decade after decade.

00:20:54.577 --> 00:21:00.124
Why would it not be appropriate to have here in

00:21:02.483 --> 00:21:31.073
the new student center maps which show the geographic home in some color coded fashion by counties and states of the current enrollment which would show that you come from a wide variety of places and then similarly place the alumni

00:21:33.027 --> 00:21:43.637
on a different set of maps to show that people go from here to careers of success in service all across the world.

00:21:48.081 --> 00:22:02.595
Already this college is making a good mark, has been earning a fine reputation for its commitment to international learning and understanding.

00:22:04.364 --> 00:22:19.729
Would it be appropriate for Austin College to consider the requirement of the speaking of a second language as one of its normal graduation requirements?

00:22:21.832 --> 00:22:30.827
Is it not likely that every one of today's students will live in a much more internationalized world

00:22:31.972 --> 00:23:00.122
so that the ability to communicate in a second language will be an additional skill just like the technology of the computer that will open more doors and lead to greater success than the ability simply

00:23:01.587 --> 00:23:06.495
to pass another three hour course in our academic major.

00:23:10.561 --> 00:23:11.102
Paragraphs.

00:23:11.122 --> 00:23:29.991
So on this day, as we pause and look around us, let us hope that this is truly a place of beginning, a time to catch our breath, pause,

00:23:32.873 --> 00:23:58.240
and prepare new dreams, set new goals, and anchor our hopes with clear vision and dreams of success.

00:24:02.725 --> 00:24:27.113
so that when a similar group gathers 50 years from now to celebrate the 200th birthday, they might smile when we conclude our view of our hopes.

00:24:28.898 --> 00:24:31.172
by saying you ain't seen nothing yet.

00:24:32.299 --> 00:24:34.352
The best is yet to come.
