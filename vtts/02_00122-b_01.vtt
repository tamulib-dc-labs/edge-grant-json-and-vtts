WEBVTT

00:02.697 --> 00:24.762
I think that our experiences that we had in

00:02.697 --> 00:24.762
relating ourselves to the

00:02.697 --> 00:24.762
schools of the state was very important. What do 
you think before, say in the mid-50s, or up until

00:32.161 --> 00:43.776
1960, what do you think was the general scholastic 
impression of Texas A&M across the state? What did

00:44.176 --> 00:47.060
the average counselor principal think A&M was? I 
think that the average principal would say that

00:48.482 --> 00:57.093
Texas A&M College is a good college. It has a good 
reputation. But it is a military school and it does

01:00.494 --> 01:08.691
emphasize agriculture and engineering. And I 
think that would be about

01:08.712 --> 01:14.163
it. I had an idea about...

01:23.748 --> 01:36.623
Well, Haskell, my going to A&M was a very fortunate 
thing for me. I think it happened in that instance,

01:36.644 --> 01:43.732
and I doubt if it would happen again. I happened to 
be into something that began to be a general

01:44.833 --> 01:52.843
movement in the country. I thought, you know, if we 
did so well with these counselors on this initial

01:54.005 --> 02:21.092
book, handbook, why couldn't we bring counselors 
in in small groups and let them be a part of it? My

02:21.393 --> 02:50.134
whole philosophy was that you determine your 
retention rate by what you do in terms of

02:21.393 --> 02:50.134
understanding the student, the placement of the 
student, the atmosphere in which they're

02:21.393 --> 02:50.134
handled,

02:21.393 --> 02:50.134
the characteristics of a good school. So I went 
over to Buck Warris and I said, Buck, I need help.

03:01.598 --> 03:05.843
And I told him what I would like to do. And Buck and I 
agreed mutually that it was an excellent thing,

03:05.863 --> 03:17.978
but it had to be well organized.

03:18.869 --> 03:29.966
we decided to call it the President's Conference 
for Scholars, I mean for,

03:18.869 --> 03:29.966
President's Conference for Freshman Students. 
When we had the earlier conference, it was the

03:30.206 --> 03:39.661
President's Conference for Counselors. And we 
thought that we would, this would be a conference

03:47.506 --> 03:52.171
where the counselor would come, but we would not 
embarrass them. They would observe and they would

03:52.812 --> 03:58.118
have help in any other way. But we would make no 
attempt to do anything that would appear that we

03:58.618 --> 04:07.609
were trying to twist an arm or this sort of thing. So 
we tied this in to this other movement that we

04:16.666 --> 04:19.832
started out first. Now there's a long history to 
this pastoral and it's documented in the,

04:20.833 --> 04:31.071
I'm sure in other areas. We, well I took tests when I 
came here in the fall of 1934. The old American

04:41.557 --> 04:51.626
Council on Education Psychological Examination 
was used in 1934 because I took it. And I kept the

04:53.408 --> 04:58.172
records on it. But when I left the center,

04:58.192 --> 05:10.543
and I was completely unaware of this, but Collison 
had a big house cleaning up there one weekend. I

05:10.563 --> 05:10.703
know. and destroyed all of the records. It's a 
shame. Let's go back to the early 60s.

05:24.387 --> 05:35.500
What do you recall about the beginnings of what we 
would call the aspirations report and study that

05:24.387 --> 05:35.500
would end up with many meaningful 
recommendations? How did that get generated? Do

05:37.982 --> 05:38.563
you know? How did that whole effort to have a 
self-study?

05:47.006 --> 06:02.786
I don't know, but from my viewpoint over in the 
counseling center, I

05:47.006 --> 06:02.786
think that we owe a great deal to the Association of 
Farmer Students. These were the people that

06:04.988 --> 06:09.394
emerged as leaders. these were the people that 
could go back to Dallas or San Antonio and I

06:09.948 --> 06:38.048
remember that Buck and I worked on this and and Buck 
worked with the former students and you remember

06:09.948 --> 06:38.048
we had two former students an older one and a 
younger one at every high school in the state and

06:38.315 --> 06:42.520
Haskell, that's awesome.

06:42.660 --> 06:45.563
They would visit students. They would have some 
recognition of counselors. They would visit with

06:52.470 --> 06:57.836
counselors and say, we're here to help you. I'll 
tell you what to do. We're here to help you. If you

07:00.339 --> 07:06.145
have a student who needs help, give us a chance. 
This thing got so effective that, as I understand

07:06.378 --> 07:19.215
it, the university asked them to let up. I don't 
remember the exact problem, but I

07:20.096 --> 07:30.630
did feel in the counseling center that we began to 
gain a lot of sophistication. I think our

07:43.466 --> 07:51.539
relationship with the college board was a very 
strategic need. Describe how that came about.

07:54.504 --> 07:57.529
That came about because the The Association of 
Two-Year Colleges, as I understand it, used to

07:59.028 --> 08:06.219
meet on our campus every fall. And for some reason 
we dropped the ball somewhere and it was picked up

08:07.201 --> 08:13.231
by you-know-who. They

08:15.274 --> 08:26.031
agreed that every two-year college in the state 
would require one or both of the two major testing,

08:26.669 --> 08:35.641
admission testing. The College Board and the 
American College Testing Board. Now,

08:40.106 --> 08:48.357
Mr. Heaton was courting the act. For some reason, 
it got a Baptist 10 or something. I don't know. But

08:56.559 --> 09:13.440
Dean Hubert, again, was one of those quiet workers 
that

08:56.559 --> 09:13.440
did the best thing for the university, I think. He 
said, now, Austin, I want this done in a way I don't

09:14.661 --> 09:18.546
have a lot of static. I said, all right, I'll do it. 
So my job was to work out a way to have the faculty

09:21.911 --> 09:32.922
make the decision of what the test would be. Which 
test? And so here's the way I did it. I contact both

09:39.187 --> 09:41.690
of them. I told them we would be happy for them to 
come. and bring a representative or more and

09:47.787 --> 09:59.503
explain to us what our program was and, I mean, what 
their program was and how it would affect us. Well,

10:01.045 --> 10:03.228
they did. I

10:03.248 --> 10:15.145
was fortunate because the college board had sent 
their top people

10:15.395 --> 10:23.382
a very pleasant fellow, but he simply was not 
effective in my opinion. But our choosing

10:24.303 --> 10:42.820
the college board, Haskell was a very important 
move for us because we needed to get some

10:24.303 --> 10:42.820
descriptive statements about the college that 
lent itself to quality. And the college board

10:51.997 --> 10:58.183
represented quality and integrity. They were a 
tremendous help to us. They sent many people down

11:01.205 --> 11:12.655
here to, well, we even had, I put up the distress 
flag it won't be history because I knew it was going

11:13.124 --> 11:20.715
to be hard to handle.

11:22.217 --> 11:31.150
They sent a young lady in her late 30's I'd say, one 
of these sharpies from one of the eastern colleges

11:31.906 --> 11:37.173
And

11:31.906 --> 11:37.173
it was great. She handled Dr. Nance.

11:44.964 --> 11:46.626
He wanted me to know. He probably wouldn't have 
anything to do with it. Well, before she left, he

11:50.671 --> 11:56.359
was. Can I digress and tell you? Oh, please do. 
Please do. Anyway.

12:02.416 --> 12:09.544
Well, the achievement testing was an integral 
part of this.

12:09.564 --> 12:30.769
I

12:09.564 --> 12:30.769
think

12:09.564 --> 12:30.769
that Dean Hubert was the first, but I think that Dr. 
Calhoun had some strong ideas because I worked

12:09.564 --> 12:30.769
with him on some of them. We chose the credit by 
examination program would be much better if we had

12:32.909 --> 12:51.036
a standardized measure than to have handmade.

12:51.637 --> 12:59.889
Because I think in most instances, if it's 
handmade, it has biases. Well, we... We developed

13:02.693 --> 13:13.824
this verifying code for loan credit by 
accumulation, used as kind of a model in lots of

13:02.693 --> 13:13.824
places.

13:15.065 --> 13:19.009
But that was for placement. But we were able to use 
some of the achievement tests for admission in

13:19.029 --> 13:30.540
other ways. like honors classes, things of that 
nature. Well, we

13:36.059 --> 13:56.528
were going to use the advanced placement test, and

13:36.059 --> 13:56.528
we didn't realize the level of expectancy on those 
tests. there are not many fives made.

14:04.414 --> 14:10.462
We finally ended up with, I believe, three or 
higher would get credit.

14:14.367 --> 14:19.655
Now, this is a story about Dr. Nance. Dr. Nance, he 
was still reluctant. He had his own place. So he,

14:27.338 --> 14:35.827
here comes our young lady again. And she showed him 
one of the tests. And boy, that thing was, it was

14:41.754 --> 14:46.399
something else. Well, Dr. Nance, he looked it over 
carefully. And he began to mellow quite a bit. But

15:01.400 --> 15:05.226
he still, though, he wanted to give the test. He 
said, fine. He said, now, I want a staff member to be

15:09.994 --> 15:18.068
responsible to bring the test over to me, and I will 
give them. And then he is to come back and get the

15:19.347 --> 15:33.005
test after I've scored it. Well,

15:33.025 --> 15:43.338
he would send a pencil sheet back with the names of 
the students who failed. Well, they would always

15:44.760 --> 15:48.325
say, this was when we were using his test. they 
would all sign.

15:54.776 --> 16:02.447
And then he would sign his name on the sheets or 
official. Well, Elder Crow would come over and get

16:02.467 --> 16:06.253
the test from him. Well, he brought him in, gave him 
to Hilda, and Hilda turned to one of the extra girls

16:07.154 --> 16:17.248
and said, type up. this list here, and we had a 
little letter that we would mail and say, we thank

16:18.207 --> 16:27.379
you for participating. And we worked on it so that 
you couldn't tell from the letter the size and all,

16:28.180 --> 16:39.594
whether you did or didn't, because they'd be 
handed out to the student. Well, the next morning,

16:44.920 --> 16:51.268
The phone rang early, and I answered

16:44.920 --> 16:51.268
it at the center. And Dr. Nance said, early? I said, 
yes, sir. He said, I want to speak to that son of a

16:54.792 --> 17:02.221
bitch you have over there. I said, Dr. Nance, 
you've got more than one. Which one were you

17:07.607 --> 17:09.129
thinking about? And oh, boy, he just exploded. He 
said, they sent me one of these letters saying I

17:14.047 --> 17:21.637
couldn't even pass my own. That's good. I said, Dr. 
Nance, I'm afraid a problem has arisen here

17:24.842 --> 17:43.547
because the young lady that typed up the letters 
saw your name and she didn't know you were a very

17:24.842 --> 17:43.547
important person and she put you down. And he said, 
well, you want to watch that? I said, yes, sir.

17:48.789 --> 17:51.993
We'll be alert on that from now on. But he was a real 
character. But I caught a lot of reading over that.

18:02.387 --> 18:09.737
Haskell, I tell you, I felt like a counseling and 
testing center. It should be a place where a

18:12.130 --> 18:20.762
student can go and seek help. It should not be a 
center that tries to run things. It's a service.

18:28.853 --> 18:30.495
And y'all served the whole campus. We served, 
well, President Rudder with his usual

18:30.615 --> 18:37.345
positiveness. He said, Curly, I want you to help 
any person who wants to attend this university. I

18:46.035 --> 18:52.322
want you to help any person who's admitted and is a 
student. And I want you to help any student that is

18:52.342 --> 18:58.489
preparing to leave. I mean, is quitting. And I want 
you to help any student who has graduated from here

19:01.753 --> 19:09.322
and is having problems. I said, yes, sir. That's 
what we will do. Well, the Counseling Center today

19:12.762 --> 19:22.752
will not see a student if they are not fully 
enrolled. See, they're thinking of money. I never

19:28.858 --> 19:33.502
allowed that in to what we would do. And I had a civil 
engineering gradually come down from Dallas. And

19:44.496 --> 19:52.786
he said, I can't work in this framework. He said, 
when they're going to build something, they tell

19:52.866 --> 20:01.276
me to level it. And he said, they have these 
beautiful trees and other landmarks. And it's not

20:08.825 --> 20:10.107
necessary. But he said, I'm young. And I said, 
well, why don't you do it the other way?

20:22.866 --> 20:27.772
Instead of using your engineering, go around to 
the out flank. Talk to some architects. And I'll

20:33.500 --> 20:39.047
bet you'll find that some of them are large enough, 
they want engineers on the staff. Well, he was

20:39.972 --> 20:44.316
delighted, and sure enough, he got a job. But I 
think President Lutter is right. Now, during

20:49.741 --> 21:00.030
those years in the 60s, you worked with the 
associate and assistant deans of each of the

20:49.741 --> 21:00.030
colleges. Describe those individuals. Talk 
about each one of them as people. Describe them.

21:09.402 --> 21:20.696
Yes,

21:09.402 --> 21:20.696
we had a little, we called it a new student week 
committee.

21:24.060 --> 21:30.448
I was chairman of that thing, and we got along fine. 
We had a little problem during the Graff

21:30.488 --> 21:38.278
administration, but other than that, This was a 
good organization.

21:44.126 --> 21:59.747
I tried to coordinate what colleges wanted to do 
and I had this young man, Blakely, I think his name

21:44.126 --> 21:59.747
was, that came back here. He bought into the 
McDonald things. He was on the staff. He was on as

22:07.739 --> 22:08.840
his staff. Blatchley. Blatchley. Ron Blatchley. 
Fine young man. And he seemed kind of at ease, not at

22:12.525 --> 22:16.409
ease. And I said, what is the question you really 
have? He said, well, they told me I had better watch

22:21.155 --> 22:27.322
myself with you. He said, you're pretty hard on us. 
And I said, how are you doing? Oh, Ron said, oh,

22:35.572 --> 22:37.054
fine. I said, well, you're not having much 
trouble, are you? He said, no. I said, well, I am

22:44.258 --> 22:56.115
very persistent in our recognizing and working 
with each other on what your area is. But I have

22:56.956 --> 23:03.486
nothing to do with saying you can do this or you 
can't do this. Now, I had the

23:05.418 --> 23:13.286
fiscal office. See, we had this thing finally to 
the point that we'd have a meeting of parents, and

23:13.306 --> 23:23.236
the fiscal office would send representatives to 
answer questions. Well, the fellow who did that,

23:23.256 --> 23:28.101
he was a check, and he's dead now. But he couldn't 
make it, so he sent this tall fellow, Smith. And

23:37.025 --> 23:54.825
about noon, the phone rang and this major over in 
ROTC, he was at the same meeting, he said, you've

23:37.025 --> 23:54.825
got to fire that son of a bitch. He said he got the 
audience so upset that one man got up to come up

23:54.845 --> 24:06.458
there.

24:06.640 --> 24:15.089
I said, this fellow later worked in the 
restaurant.

24:15.109 --> 24:20.435
I called and told them, oh, there's a check. I said, 
you must not

24:20.455 --> 24:26.721
have him back. We're not here for that. We are here 
to serve as people that are glad to help.

24:36.391 --> 24:43.958
Well, now all these

24:36.391 --> 24:43.958
members of this. Yeah, these associate assistant 
deans. New student committee. But now, we had not

24:50.485 --> 24:58.132
only the associate dean, but we had people from the 
registrar's office. Even Dollar got in on it.

25:03.918 --> 25:04.879
Let's see. Now, Dr. Ransdell was the person 
that... Now, Mike... Oh, the other one that was in

25:05.450 --> 25:17.926
engineering. He's from my part of the country. 
He's dead. But Dr. Ransdell was, of course, a

25:23.353 --> 25:34.528
well-read person in this area because he was in on 
the very beginning of it and... He was always

25:35.217 --> 25:39.644
prepared. Dr. Potts was the dynamo. Let's go. 
That's what's holding us up. That's R.C. Potts in

25:52.563 --> 25:53.785
agriculture. Yes. R.C. Potts told me one time, he 
said, Austin, you make me sick. He said... You run

26:04.850 --> 26:10.596
around here, and if things aren't working, you 
work on it. And he said, that's not the way you do it.

26:14.580 --> 26:20.686
He said, what you do is, if they want to goof off, let 
them goof off. And then it'll get so bad that

26:20.706 --> 26:24.690
they'll say, we got to do something. And then they 
will respond. I said, well, now, Richard, we've

26:29.915 --> 26:34.840
got a lot of students here. And they're having to 
pay for someone to learn the hard way. And I don't

26:41.547 --> 26:47.113
want that. The old sergeant from Beck Medicine, 
Mac Murray, he was in that famous march in Burma. He

27:00.648 --> 27:04.472
was very blunt, very pragmatic, but you could tell 
on him. And he always made meetings.

27:16.295 --> 27:19.779
Geology and science. Yeah. Well, no, John Beckham 
was in science. And now John, John was a great man.

27:27.629 --> 27:28.230
Great man. Gifted.

27:33.140 --> 27:37.665
His booming voice I can hear thinking about it. 
Business? Business. We had this fellow that

27:43.252 --> 27:57.849
he was a pilot for World War II. Tall. But now he was 
very capable. He lacked experience, but he, Lowe,

28:03.127 --> 28:10.153
Dan Lowe, Dan Lowe. And the architecture, 
architecture, they were very intrigued with all

28:10.173 --> 28:27.528
this, but they had a little difficulty finding out 
where they, where they were. One time I had the

28:27.548 --> 28:31.632
dean, say, Olsen, what am I supposed to say? And I 
said, well, just tell them that you welcomed me out

28:37.439 --> 28:50.110
to the campus, where you are, and you'll be glad to 
help. It was a group of every one of them. We didn't

28:55.323 --> 29:00.350
have a salary. Let's see, we didn't do liberal 
arts. In the liberal arts, let's see. You know,

29:08.101 --> 29:15.191
these fellows played roles and... Schlesselman 
and then... Yeah, Schlesselman. Then

29:15.291 --> 29:16.413
McCandless. McCandless. I think it was 
McCandless. They, well you know McCandless had

29:20.701 --> 29:30.355
done a dozen things.

29:30.756 --> 29:35.703
It was a very congenial group we worked for. What 
about the man who ran the registrar's office for a

29:35.723 --> 29:41.792
few years named Heaton? Describe Mr. Heaton and 
working with him. Mr. Heaton was, to me, was an old

29:45.743 --> 29:51.631
time. He was a man who had developed a certain 
procedure at work. And he was not far changed. As a

30:10.399 --> 30:13.523
matter of fact, when I introduced the concept of 
the student being able to pay their fees while

30:14.262 --> 30:19.809
they're here. Mr. Heaton says it's against the 
law.

30:27.860 --> 30:35.410
And in some respects I felt for him because It must 
have been many uncomfortable moments for him

30:35.626 --> 30:47.926
because Haskell

30:35.626 --> 30:47.926
was getting away from it. And it would have been 
better if he had, Haskell, I just could not handle

30:47.946 --> 30:55.879
those two jobs. I know I was supposed to have gone 
over there and cleaned that up, but I just

30:57.040 --> 31:11.878
honestly, well I was, my health was 
deteriorating.

31:13.460 --> 31:24.533
And I know the last time I met with the president,

31:13.460 --> 31:24.533
he asked me if a certain plan was in agreement. And I 
said, well, Mr. Heaton has agreed. He said, I

31:32.539 --> 31:36.210
didn't ask Mr. Heaton, I asked you. Well, you see, I 
felt like it.
