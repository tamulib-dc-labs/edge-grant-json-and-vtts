WEBVTT

00:02.545 --> 00:04.067
Turn it off. Do you have it off? It's on now. Turn it 
off? Okay, if you could tell me a little bit about

00:10.213 --> 00:14.377
the difference between the old and new towns. Just 
start with the old town, what it was like. It's

00:18.201 --> 00:29.493
going to be hard for me to tell how the old town was, 
but it's 90% of the people that live in the old town,

00:18.201 --> 00:29.493
they were Latin Americans. We had very few Anglo 
Americans. And the old town is now underwater. We

00:39.292 --> 00:42.936
had a big flood in, I think it was 1954.

00:45.139 --> 00:52.848
And we moved just before that big flood in 1953

00:45.139 --> 00:52.848
to this new town of Zapata.

01:01.979 --> 01:02.860
The old town Zapata was the old courthouse there. 
It was built in 1900.

01:12.337 --> 01:18.085
And

01:12.337 --> 01:18.085
now everything is underwater. Everything's 
underwater. Well, how did it happen to be

01:19.167 --> 01:23.173
underwater? In 1954,

01:23.293 --> 01:32.948
a big flood came along the Rio Grande. And we all had 
to move in a hurry.

01:42.503 --> 01:53.017
Of course, we had here in these new towns, we had to 
move some of the old buildings from the old town to

01:42.503 --> 01:53.017
this new site here. But you already expected to 
have to move. Oh, yes. We were advised by the

01:56.722 --> 02:04.673
International Boundary and Water Commission 
that the old town was going to be flooded. since

02:05.345 --> 02:15.338
they were building that big dam, which is just, 
say, about two miles from the county line of

02:05.345 --> 02:15.338
Zapata. The dam is in Stark County. And we were 
advised by the boundary commission that in the

02:18.762 --> 02:29.676
first big flood, the town of Zapata would be 
flooded, that we had to move, and we had to move. You

02:30.397 --> 02:32.220
mean when the flood came, it was very quick? Yes, it 
was very quick. How much time did you actually

02:34.707 --> 02:36.409
have? Well, we had about, I'd say about three days. 
Three days? Yeah.

02:45.338 --> 02:47.320
How come people hadn't moved sooner? Well, I tell 
you, some people, not all, but some people, they

02:48.101 --> 02:56.910
thought that the old town would never be flooded. 
Oh, really? They didn't believe. I'm not going to

02:59.953 --> 03:04.478
say that all, but some of the people, they didn't 
want to move. They just waited until the last

03:04.745 --> 03:07.949
minute, I'll say. Well, had there been any effort 
to save the town? Yes, there were made effort, but

03:13.516 --> 03:16.699
not... They were not... We were about... They can 
save the town. There were no way to save the town.

03:27.012 --> 03:30.596
Now, did you get any kind of replacement for... 
Yes, we were paid by the... government, by the U.S.

03:34.782 --> 03:40.710
government, for our houses.

03:40.730 --> 03:53.407
Before we go on,

03:40.730 --> 03:53.407
why don't you say your name in here and how long 
you've lived here? Well, I lived here all my life. I

03:59.215 --> 04:04.722
was born in the county, and I've been living here 
all my life, except for the a few months out of it,

04:04.887 --> 04:09.598
but just working outside of the county. But I've 
been living here in this county for all my life. And

04:11.804 --> 04:12.505
your name is? Juventino Martinez. And so you 
remember both the old town and the new town very

04:16.548 --> 04:20.394
well. Yes, yes. Is life considerably different? 
Well, not to us, not much different. To me, I won't

04:28.285 --> 04:32.712
say to me, and I think to most of the people, it's 
just about the same. We're just living in the

04:32.752 --> 04:38.780
people that used to go out north to work. They still 
do the same. They live here in the town. And they'll

04:42.923 --> 04:50.272
go and stay about two or three months out of the 
county, and they'll just come back, and they have

04:42.923 --> 04:50.272
their homes here in Zapata. What percentage of the 
people would you say do go work up north? Well, it's

04:54.398 --> 04:56.280
not a very big percentage. I'd say about,

04:56.380 --> 05:02.908
I don't think so, two or three percent. Two or 
three, but that wouldn't be very many people. No,

05:04.791 --> 05:06.032
no, no, not very many people. So most people stay 
here all year? They stay here all year, yes. Well,

05:10.092 --> 05:18.324
has there been any... Would you say that there have 
been advantages in moving or disadvantages?

05:18.624 --> 05:19.946
Well, I can tell you. Some people, I think it was an 
advantage on account of this big lake. Some

05:29.420 --> 05:37.872
people, they are doing good business because we 
have a lot of people coming from outside, a lot of

05:29.420 --> 05:37.872
tourists. Most

05:38.662 --> 05:47.395
of it, every winter, they start coming in about, I 
say in about September and October. The people

05:48.596 --> 05:57.349
come from North Michigan, New Mexico, Arizona, 
Ohio. And I say the, sometimes the two, I say about

05:58.631 --> 06:04.099
1,000 people or maybe more. They stay about two, 
three months. especially as retired people. So

06:11.435 --> 06:13.297
this brings in some income that you get. Yeah, it 
brings a lot of income. But we lost, on account of

06:17.463 --> 06:31.040
building this dam, the county lost, I say, about 
4,000 or 5,000 acres that were irrigation. Well,

06:31.060 --> 06:32.362
that's a lot of land. Yeah, a lot of land, yes. I say 
about, I don't know, I say, I want to say about from

06:37.336 --> 06:40.959
2,000 to 3,000 acres. Well, has it been possible to 
put another 2,000 or 3,000 acres back into

06:40.979 --> 06:45.164
irrigation? I don't think so, ma'am. We don't 
have, you know, the riverbed. It was just level

06:50.609 --> 06:52.310
land. It was beautiful land for irrigation. 
Right. We didn't have any trouble at all. I didn't

06:56.755 --> 07:04.162
own any land, but the people that owned the land, 
they had a lot of good land for irrigation. Now,

07:04.182 --> 07:05.503
since the... Water covered all that land. Now most 
of the out-country is now hilly country. I see. And

07:14.754 --> 07:15.235
what about the soil? Well, the soil is very good. 
But it would be very lot of trouble to level that

07:16.697 --> 07:24.527
land to irrigate. Of course, we have on the north 
part of the county, I say from here, we got a lot of

07:25.068 --> 07:32.959
good land for irrigation too. And we don't have the 
water now. You don't have the water? No, ma'am.

07:39.923 --> 07:41.705
With all the water in your lake? All the water in the 
lake belongs to the state or to the U.S.

07:41.785 --> 07:45.370
government. And you have to get a permission, and 
sometimes they don't give you enough water. Well,

07:50.296 --> 07:54.922
what about people who already had those lands 
under irrigation by then? Well, some of those

07:54.942 --> 08:00.510
people, I think they lost their— Their water 
rights? Their water rights. And there's not

08:03.331 --> 08:05.194
anything they can do? I don't know. Unless they go 
back to the state commission, water commission.

08:14.207 --> 08:16.570
So this is one of the disadvantages. Yes, ma'am. 
The loss of both the flatlands and the water. The

08:20.696 --> 08:22.378
water, yes. The irrigation on those lands. They 
used to raise a lot of tomatoes, onions, cotton,

08:24.141 --> 08:30.570
good cane, corn. We don't have that anymore. We 
have a little smaller irrigation from San

08:34.939 --> 08:41.085
Ignacio. That's next town from here. They have 
irrigation over there. San Ignacio didn't have to

08:46.029 --> 08:48.432
move, did it? No, they didn't have to move. They 
tried to move that town too, but they finally

08:50.273 --> 08:56.940
decided that they didn't have to move. Was this 
town a lot like San Ignacio before? Yes. Yes, well,

09:01.668 --> 09:05.011
more or less the same. What about social life? 
Going from farming to reliance on tourism, has

09:10.136 --> 09:17.224
that affected life here in any way? Well, I don't 
know. It didn't affect me much because I've only

09:19.005 --> 09:26.873
been working in the courthouse most of my time. I 
used to work with the county clerk. I'm still here

09:30.357 --> 09:31.658
with the county clerk. You're with the county 
clerk? No, I'm not working with him anymore. I quit

09:34.563 --> 09:36.346
about four months ago. I resigned. I'm retired 
now. Oh, you're retired. I'm too old to work. I

09:44.519 --> 09:45.721
still do a little work. I don't want to just stay 
home and lay down. I'd like to do something. What

09:50.689 --> 09:51.810
about the young people? Are they staying here now? 
Well, they are staying here. We have a very good

09:55.276 --> 09:59.282
high school, very good elementary schools. And 
those buildings, they are very nice. We didn't

10:04.785 --> 10:06.186
have those in the old town. And with the help of the 
US government, the schools are in very good shape.

10:16.419 --> 10:21.645
We have very good, I say, teachers, very good 
teachers. Most of them, they have their degrees,

10:21.665 --> 10:25.810
master degrees. Are they mostly people from here, 
or are they from other places? Well, mostly from

10:32.097 --> 10:38.504
here, and just very few from outside.

10:40.566 --> 10:45.511
Now, Guerrero, across the river, was also 
relocated, wasn't it? Yeah, it was relocated.

10:46.672 --> 10:51.337
That old town was built, I'd say, about 220 years 
ago. It was an old Spanish town, built of sand

10:51.357 --> 10:56.843
rocks, narrow streets. And

11:00.460 --> 11:06.386
now they have a new modern town. The difference 
between the government, the Mexican and the

11:06.446 --> 11:23.502
American government, that the Mexican 
government built their houses in the new

11:06.446 --> 11:23.502
Guerrero, and they were just given to those 
people, those people that moved to the new

11:06.446 --> 11:23.502
Guerrero. So everybody got a new house. Everybody 
got a new house. All those that own houses in old

11:27.569 --> 11:35.124
Guerrero, they went and got one in the new 
Guerrero. What about the people from Zapata? We

11:38.931 --> 11:40.053
had to build our own. We just got the money, and we 
had to build our own. Which do you think was better?

11:46.065 --> 11:46.746
Well, I don't know. I think the money was better. 
The money was there. Of course, I don't know. I

11:51.982 --> 11:52.523
don't know. It's just a matter of thinking, 
really. Maybe. I really don't know. Some of those

11:57.070 --> 12:00.796
people, they had very beautiful houses there. The 
ones here? No. No, the ones over there? Yes. They

12:03.580 --> 12:05.423
got very beautiful houses? Yes, some of them got 
beautiful brick houses. Were they satisfied with

12:07.486 --> 12:10.390
their houses? Some were satisfied and some were 
not. That's the difference. Over here, the same

12:14.684 --> 12:15.966
thing. Some were satisfied with the money. With 
the money, some were not satisfied. So if you were

12:20.212 --> 12:32.128
going to say you were on a planning commission and 
you had to help the government decide what to do if a

12:20.212 --> 12:32.128
town was being moved because of a dam, what would 
you recommend? Having seen it done two different

12:32.188 --> 12:36.233
ways. Well, I tell you, I was working with the 
boundary commission at that time. Oh, you were?

12:40.720 --> 12:41.080
Yes. I was employed by the boundary commission for 
that purposes. I used to go house by house with the

12:45.477 --> 13:01.633
people, advising them that they had to move

12:45.477 --> 13:01.633
because the town of Zapata would be flooded. And 
some people believed me, and some they said, no,

13:02.815 --> 13:06.238
you're crazy. This town will never be flooded. 
Although Zapata had actually been flooded twice,

13:10.051 --> 13:16.157
even without a dam, had been moved twice. No, when 
it was moved twice, the oldest... The oldest. The

13:19.760 --> 13:23.563
oldest, it was named not Zapata, it was named 
Carrizo. It was flooded. And in 1900, moved to

13:26.486 --> 13:33.072
this, to a new site, which is now, we call it the old 
site now. Then it's flooded again. Yeah, it's

13:34.853 --> 13:36.355
flooded again. And I hope we're not going to get 
flooded again here. Because the tables had been

13:41.270 --> 13:48.939
moved once without a dam, and then we moved again. 
Who were the first families that moved into

13:50.641 --> 13:55.226
Zapata? I guess we moved most everybody at the same 
time. Oh, oh, to New Zapata. I was thinking about

14:00.292 --> 14:02.094
Carizo. Well, I don't know much. It goes back a long 
way. Long ways back. I don't know much about that.

14:10.345 --> 14:13.809
Because in the old Carrizo, there were the 
Redmonds. I don't remember. But I think the

14:17.734 --> 14:24.622
Redmonds were the first to build the old Carrizo, 
Redmond. And there were a lot of people. I don't

14:25.703 --> 14:27.125
know who they were.

14:30.809 --> 14:36.115
But then the news about that, everybody pretty 
much, you mean everybody waited until the flood of

14:30.809 --> 14:36.115
54? Almost. Yes, just about. And were there any 
houses here for people to live in? Yes, there were

14:43.308 --> 14:44.188
some. Who had built those? No, no, we moved some of 
the old houses. Oh, you moved some of the old

14:48.313 --> 14:49.134
houses? And some people, especially from below 
here. There was the Lo Peña Village and all those

14:52.377 --> 15:00.967
small villages below Zapata. They were flooded 
before the old town Zapata, and those people

15:00.987 --> 15:05.952
didn't have houses. The government lent those 
people tents. They were living in tents. Good

15:13.547 --> 15:13.807
heavens. How long did they live in tents? Well, 
some lived about two, three months. Some lived

15:17.152 --> 15:19.234
four, five months, some six months. And most of 
those people, they were the Red Cross. Did a lot of

15:25.282 --> 15:29.768
good help to those people. They were furnished 
with tents and with food. for some time now.

15:40.764 --> 15:47.671
How much warning did you have that you were going to 
have to move in the first place? Well, we had long,

15:47.691 --> 15:50.494
many times we were warned. No, many times. Many 
times, yes. It wasn't really unexpected. And it

15:54.538 --> 16:03.607
was, I was instructed to tell the people

15:54.538 --> 16:03.607
that they have to be moved. Say, no, we are not They 
finally, when they saw that the old town of La Pena,

16:05.315 --> 16:28.742
which is about 18 miles below here, was flooded, 
then they start doing something to, because if we

16:05.315 --> 16:28.742
had a lot in the old town,

16:05.315 --> 16:28.742
they had this new town here, and they built the 
subdivision. And we had to trade lots. If I had a lot

16:32.146 --> 16:35.170
in the old town, they gave me a lot in the new town. 
And I start doing that with the people. I start

16:39.330 --> 16:42.615
trading lots with those people. That was my duty at 
that time. That was my work, the work I was doing.

16:48.582 --> 16:53.269
Well, now, Mercurio Martinez Sr. from Laredo was 
also doing that, wasn't he? Yes, he, Mercurio

16:53.489 --> 17:00.538
Martinez, myself, and we had another old man from 
Lo Peño that we all worked together. Did you know

17:01.099 --> 17:02.681
Mercurio Martinez? Oh, I knew him very well. What 
kind of He was a very nice person. He was very

17:06.867 --> 17:08.209
well-educated. Have you seen his book, The 
Kingdom of Zapata? Yes, I've seen The Kingdom of

17:14.055 --> 17:16.738
Zapata. I think my name's in that book. I can't 
recall right now. It had a lot of names, but I'll

17:22.404 --> 17:24.527
look back through it. Maybe. I'm not sure, but I 
think my name's in it. I think it probably

17:27.991 --> 17:32.055
is. I'm not sure what my name's in that book, but I 
think it probably is. Well, would you say that

17:39.849 --> 17:44.813
things have changed more here than they have in San 
Ignacio? Yes, it has changed more here. Do you

17:48.917 --> 17:51.179
think that's because of moving? Yes, because of 
moving, and now we have more people. We

17:54.442 --> 18:00.928
have a lot more people living in this new town now. 
And on account of the time, we have more people

18:02.647 --> 18:09.577
living and we have more business

18:02.647 --> 18:09.577
than now. Well, thank you very much. I'm pretty 
sure he gives you a lot of information, because I

18:13.562 --> 18:17.047
know. Oh, I hope so. How do you think? Do you think 
he's still around? Well, I don't know. But he is

18:24.037 --> 18:25.759
just about half a block from here. Well, would it be 
all right if we just go by his house? I'm pretty

18:30.305 --> 18:31.066
sure. This is very nice. Mary, would you get the 
plug for me? Mr. San Miguel, could you give me his

18:37.473 --> 18:42.100
address? How might I find it? Here.

18:51.275 --> 18:55.722
Okay.

19:06.248 --> 19:09.593
Thank

19:06.248 --> 19:09.593
you.
