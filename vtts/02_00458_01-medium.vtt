WEBVTT

00:11.607 --> 00:21.977
Okay, this is May the 6th, 1990, interview by 
Michael Enochs. The person being interviewed is

00:23.879 --> 00:28.243
Alan Enochs. And Alan, the first question is, in

00:28.263 --> 00:40.095
the interest of accumulated knowledge, asking 
you to donate this tape. the Texas A&M oral history

00:40.598 --> 00:45.383
collection in the University Archives. Is that 
all right with you? That's okay. Okay. All right.

00:49.567 --> 00:55.072
Now then, first question. You joined the Army in 
1967,

00:55.092 --> 01:08.125
and I have here specifically to become a warrant 
officer to fly helicopters and to go to Vietnam.

01:09.134 --> 01:11.997
And what were your reasons for this decision? I 
needed to get drafted. As I was out of school or not

01:17.383 --> 01:24.631
doing well in school, I figured my draft number was 
about up, and so it was time to make the best deal.

01:25.291 --> 01:28.255
But also, it was a shortcut to go and start flying. 
So there were really two reasons. Yeah, flying the

01:33.220 --> 01:36.103
helicopters was really the main reason. Vietnam 
was not something you were necessarily

01:37.315 --> 01:42.741
interested in, if possible. Is that correct? Or 
were you wanting to go to Vietnam? Not at all. OK.

01:48.147 --> 01:53.093
No, that was one of the unfortunate. It was sort of 
inevitable at that point. Exact consequences of

01:55.375 --> 01:58.639
doing it. All right. OK. After arriving in 
Vietnam, can you describe your assignments and

01:58.879 --> 02:06.107
activities?

02:07.555 --> 02:29.289
Arriving in Vietnam, I went to 17th Group and was 
assigned to 7th and 17th Air Cavalry and became a

02:07.555 --> 02:29.289
scout pilot for them, which was basically going 
out, flying out, hovering in the bushes, looking

02:07.555 --> 02:29.289
for any signs of any enemy activity in any 
suspected hotspots wherever we were put. And we

02:31.112 --> 02:35.098
usually found them by getting shot at, but that's 
what we did. Okay, uh, where were you stationed at

02:35.399 --> 02:38.583
that time? I was stationed in Campanari in, uh, 
Pleiku, Vietnam. Pleiku. And shortly thereafter

02:43.811 --> 02:45.874
went to Phanthiet. To, uh, would you repeat that? 
Uh, went to Phanthiet, Vietnam. I spent, uh, five

02:50.240 --> 03:01.576
months in Phanthiet, went to, back to Campanari, 
and then our troops moved to Bamituid, and then I

02:50.240 --> 03:01.576
went back to Campanari at the end of the tour. Okay. 
Uh, Would you describe the racial makeup of your

03:04.998 --> 03:09.204
group?

03:12.229 --> 03:15.334
Mostly white. Enlisted, probably a few more 
blacks. Officers, probably 2% to 3% were black.

03:27.112 --> 03:29.716
As far as enlisted, I really can't remember how 
many there were. But it might have been 10% to 20%

03:30.497 --> 03:33.942
black. Okay.

03:37.623 --> 03:44.810
Now, of the 2% or 3% officers that were black, were 
part of these also pilots? Oh, yeah. The unit I was

03:46.172 --> 03:50.236
with was mainly pilots. There were 67 officers in 
the unit, and

03:50.256 --> 03:59.845
probably 66 of them were officers, pilots. Okay, 
and of the 66, maybe a couple, as many as two or three

04:00.905 --> 04:09.336
of them were black? Uh-huh. Yeah, I was just trying 
to think how many there were, and it was one or two of

04:10.658 --> 04:14.543
them. Okay. I remember one of them real well, but I 
can't remember half the truth anyway. Yeah, I

04:20.490 --> 04:21.431
understand. Were there any racial problems 
within the group? None at all that I remember.

04:30.423 --> 04:30.523
Okay. No, I don't remember any racial problems.

04:37.245 --> 04:41.932
What were your feelings about the U.S. 
involvement in Vietnam when you joined?

04:45.557 --> 04:46.538
Really, no feelings. I was 19 years old when I 
joined.

04:52.126 --> 04:56.132
As far as should be there or shouldn't be there, I 
guess that's where you're just trusting in the

04:52.126 --> 04:56.132
government.

04:59.957 --> 05:00.578
So, I guess It was okay at that time with me. During 
your first tour of duty, did your feelings

05:05.353 --> 05:11.983
regarding our involvement change any?

05:24.021 --> 05:25.343
Did my feelings change any? I'm just trying to 
think of how I felt when I came out. and

05:30.393 --> 05:54.662
uh yeah i guess though i still wasn't uh against so 
no no i still wasn't against the war at that point

05:30.393 --> 05:54.662
you still felt like that what the country was doing 
they were doing for a good reason yeah

05:30.393 --> 05:54.662
uh Was there any discussion within your group 
about why we were fighting in Vietnam? Very

06:01.859 --> 06:02.400
little. I really, like I say, it's a long time ago, 
but I don't really remember any heated

06:05.102 --> 06:12.590
discussions or anything going on about why we were 
there.

06:15.954 --> 06:16.134
Okay.

06:19.978 --> 06:21.139
I've got here if any. of this discussion, or did any 
of this discussion change between your first tour

06:22.975 --> 06:33.166
of duty in 1969 and when you were over there the 
second time?

06:36.929 --> 06:46.840
Second tour, I don't really remember anything 
much, but when I was there, second tour, I was only

06:36.929 --> 06:46.840
in the unit for just over a month, it seems like. I 
think like I was in, I know I got out in January of 71,

06:46.860 --> 06:52.105
but I got there November and it was a lot of hard 
November when I got assigned to a unit so I was it was

06:53.030 --> 07:16.236
maybe a little more than a month I was actually in 
unit I didn't really hardly get to know people well

06:53.030 --> 07:16.236
I don't have this question on the sheet but let me 
ask you this between the time you got back from your

06:53.030 --> 07:16.236
first terror duty while you were between tours of 
duty, and I guess you were stationed in Germany a

07:17.093 --> 07:22.540
good part of that time. Was there any discussion? 
Do you recall any discussion about our

07:28.388 --> 07:35.158
involvement in Vietnam between those people that 
were in with you? No, I really don't.

07:39.484 --> 07:41.927
No, I don't remember any discussion at all in 
Germany. OK. Could you describe your

07:45.173 --> 07:52.539
relationship with the Vietnamese people, both 
the military personnel and the civilians? Okay, I

07:52.660 --> 08:13.678
was very isolated from the Vietnamese people 
totally in the unit as

07:52.660 --> 08:13.678
we were, from the time I got in the country, we were 
always restricted in going into town, or more or

07:52.660 --> 08:13.678
less always, and so I had very little chance to ever 
mix or talk with any of the Vietnamese people. Say

08:17.955 --> 08:43.986
the last three months that I was in country and I was

08:17.955 --> 08:43.986
the civil affairs officer for the squadron that I 
was in, which meant that I had two villages, a

08:17.955 --> 08:43.986
mountain yard village named and a Vietnamese 
village, Lausanne, that we had a civil affairs

08:17.955 --> 08:43.986
team that would go out to It helped out with little 
government projects. We also rent a medical

08:48.251 --> 08:51.154
shelter in Lausanne. And then I also took care of 
the indigenous personnel on the base. But any

08:56.558 --> 09:02.063
in-depth discussions, didn't really have any. It 
was on a...

09:02.243 --> 09:09.009
Oh, what? Very shallow level. It was... Just 
business-type relationships, you might say.

09:19.987 --> 09:20.147
Okay. Did your feelings toward the people of 
Vietnam change while you were there? For

09:25.134 --> 09:28.778
instance, your feelings toward the military 
personnel? I didn't really feel like... Well, I

09:29.219 --> 09:39.373
guess that was one of the feelings over there, was 
the fact that we just didn't feel like they cared

09:29.219 --> 09:39.373
much about... They didn't have their hearts into 
the fighting end of it, that might be a good way to

09:40.334 --> 09:44.820
put it. they uh anytime they've gotten any heavy 
firefighters or something they were always

09:45.695 --> 10:14.284
calling for u.s assistance and so we would be 
rolling in to help them out on something like that

09:45.695 --> 10:14.284
but they never really appeared to be good fighters 
or fighting for a cause or anything you might say

09:45.695 --> 10:14.284
and your uh experience there with the civilians 
during the last three months, could you describe

10:15.074 --> 10:26.853
possibly how you felt about their feelings 
towards Americans or whatever?

10:31.581 --> 10:34.886
Their feelings towards Americans? The 
Vietnamese, the people of Lausanne, were Oh, they

10:43.002 --> 10:48.487
were nice enough, but they didn't really give a 
hoot about us being there. Where the mountain

10:49.407 --> 11:00.037
yards were more,

10:49.407 --> 11:00.037
were happier to be around the American people. 
They were a little more congenial.

11:06.162 --> 11:12.267
As far as working with you and your efforts to 
whatever you were doing there, were they Did they

11:13.310 --> 11:23.727
work with you on it, or just exactly as far as that 
part went, a working relationship?

11:28.554 --> 11:36.567
The mountain yards were a lot more to kick in and 
help and whatever, where the Vietnamese people

11:28.554 --> 11:36.567
were really, I guess, looking for a handout.

11:39.517 --> 11:42.040
You know, come in, do this, do that, do that. That 
will help us. It's

11:43.701 --> 11:48.606
fine. Could you describe the general attitudes of 
the Americans that you knew in Vietnam toward the

11:48.707 --> 11:56.274
Vietnamese military? The general attitude was 
that they didn't fight worth a hoot. They

12:02.581 --> 12:03.702
weren't... You wouldn't trust them to help you on 
some job as far as fire fighting or whatever. Yeah,

12:14.029 --> 12:19.796
that's sort of the general feeling, sort of what I 
said before. They just did not care to contribute

12:20.156 --> 12:25.542
that much or weren't able to, whatever. Okay. How 
about towards the civilians? The general

12:31.228 --> 12:35.393
attitude of the people you were with or the 
Americans? general attitude, I guess we weren't

12:36.453 --> 12:45.647
that well accepted in Vietnam.

12:45.667 --> 12:46.948
Okay.

12:48.731 --> 12:53.258
While in Vietnam, were you aware of the peace 
movement in the United States? Yes.

12:57.043 --> 13:00.248
While there, could you describe your feelings 
towards that movement? Well, it wasn't very good.

13:04.534 --> 13:05.616
I guess or while there, yeah,

13:06.642 --> 13:19.537
it just didn't feel like you had any support from 
the U.S. at all.

13:21.800 --> 13:28.868
Was there discussion within the group as far as 
about the issues that were brought up by the

13:21.800 --> 13:28.868
movement? I really can't recall any feelings or 
any discussions.

13:39.228 --> 13:44.095
Lost

13:39.228 --> 13:44.095
my place. While performing your duties, were 
there any restrictions or limitations in place

13:46.097 --> 13:51.965
because of politics? And did the nature of these 
restrictions or limitations change, for

13:53.167 --> 14:02.680
instance, between your first tour of duty and your 
second tour of duty? There were a lot of

14:04.402 --> 14:08.948
limitations on like rules of engagement. They 
were fairly strict, even on the first tour, where

14:09.772 --> 14:20.042
any time we went into an area, we were given room to 
engage in the first tour. We were actually given

14:20.062 --> 14:23.306
free fire zones sometimes. But if it wasn't a free 
fire zone, even if we were being shot at before we

14:23.326 --> 14:36.319
could return fire, we would have to request 
permission to return fire and have somebody

14:36.620 --> 14:37.541
approve it. Second tour, it was very, very strict 
that you could get in a bind really if you didn't

14:38.502 --> 14:51.814
know the person who approved the shoot. So, and 
generally politics played in it. I would surmise

14:58.420 --> 15:06.508
as some of the areas that, like second tour, one of 
the areas I was in I was flying with the 23rd

15:07.130 --> 15:16.438
Infantry Division, which was originally the 
Americal Division, as William Kelly's name. And

15:16.458 --> 15:19.982
we were up close to the village of Milai. Had a bird 
shot down. I was on station in a Cobra at that time

15:22.484 --> 15:31.032
with one gun, fully loaded, and requested 
permission to fire. And we couldn't shoot back,

15:31.172 --> 15:36.917
even though we were being shot at that time with a 
bird on the ground. had to get him out the best we

15:37.538 --> 16:07.208
could so and they kept saying no civilians on the 
ground and it was the area that we were in pure

15:37.538 --> 16:07.208
reason

15:37.538 --> 16:07.208
that we couldn't shoot back yeah so it was just just 
strictly because you were close to an area that had

15:37.538 --> 16:07.208
already gotten a lot of attention exactly yeah but 
uh generally there was a lot of areas that you could

15:37.538 --> 16:07.208
shoot in that were areas of suspected heavy enemy 
concentration that you weren't allowed to shoot

16:08.774 --> 16:17.403
in just because you weren't allowed to shoot 
there. Right. That didn't work. Okay. And your

16:21.848 --> 16:31.638
incident there near Malai, Malai, you're talking 
about having a bird on the ground, and I'm assuming

16:21.848 --> 16:31.638
there were men on the ground that you were trying 
to... Oh, yeah, yeah. We had a bird shot down, so we

16:31.658 --> 16:33.520
had... It was a Huey. We had... Probably eight to 
ten of our own on the ground. Seems like we used to

16:41.268 --> 16:46.433
carry about four to six birds, so yeah, six to eight 
people on the ground. Okay, and wound up other

16:46.453 --> 16:52.039
helicopters going in under fire? Yeah. But not 
able to fire while they were going in? Well,

16:57.245 --> 16:58.646
supposedly not able to. Okay. Officially not able 
to. Officially not able to. Okay.

17:06.858 --> 17:18.811
Could you describe your feelings about how the 
military was conducting the war in Vietnam?

17:20.132 --> 17:20.553
I don't know. As far as the tactics that were being 
used, I don't know. At the time, I sure was in a

17:28.401 --> 17:35.329
position to understand the overall strategies 
and

17:38.583 --> 17:41.687
No, I really don't know how I felt about it. Well, 
when you were, for instance, in these positions

17:42.708 --> 18:05.755
where you knew that you were in contact or you had 
contact with the enemy, but you're not being

17:42.708 --> 18:05.755
allowed to either return fire or to pursue the 
enemy, did that lead to discussion between your

17:42.708 --> 18:05.755
men as to why or what the purpose was? Yeah, 
everybody was generally very upset about the

18:06.342 --> 18:11.006
whole situation.

18:13.808 --> 18:14.989
Was not pleased at all.

18:18.372 --> 18:21.195
But what do you, I don't know what to say about it.

18:24.678 --> 18:35.927
Okay, well now, in the second part of that same 
question, was your feelings towards the way the

18:24.678 --> 18:35.927
U.S. government was conducting the war.

18:37.291 --> 18:43.098
Were

18:37.291 --> 18:43.098
they doing it right? Were they doing it wrong?

18:48.405 --> 18:49.106
I really don't know. I don't know if they were 
handling it right or not. It was a guerrilla war.

18:56.275 --> 18:58.758
It's a new type of war. No lines, nothing. How do you 
know if you're winning or losing or whatever? I

19:05.486 --> 19:07.028
never really had much feeling on it. Things were 
getting ahead if there was something to do

19:09.826 --> 19:13.973
different and right. Sort of felt like we weren't 
doing that much.

19:20.263 --> 19:28.436
Okay, well, now then, when you returned to the 
United States, could you describe your welcome,

19:20.263 --> 19:28.436
if any? Welcome is a bad word to use for it. Yeah, you 
came back and you just didn't want to wear the

19:34.463 --> 19:38.127
uniform. You didn't want to be recognized as part 
of the military because you were not treated well.

19:47.956 --> 19:49.538
I don't know. More or less abused if you had the 
uniform on would be a good way to put it. When you

19:54.623 --> 19:58.947
came back your first time, where did you come in? 
Came into, well, when I came back first time, I came

19:59.327 --> 20:04.032
into Washington. planted in Tacoma. Okay. Uh, 
and, uh, did you, did you experience this feeling

20:08.146 --> 20:20.424
or this attitude about not wanting to wear the 
uniform right off or was it something? Yeah,

20:20.444 --> 20:31.420
generally, uh, anybody around, I'd say anybody, 
most people or a lot of people you ran into were, um,

20:34.859 --> 20:36.241
Oh, gosh, what the word. Well, you didn't get a good 
welcome. Hey, great job or anything. You never

20:44.191 --> 20:45.613
heard anything like that. What are you all doing 
over there anyway?

20:51.221 --> 20:52.042
War mongers. I don't know. Gentle attitude was not 
good. Since you're from the middle of the country,

20:58.070 --> 21:03.297
this... Did this seem to change any as you, for 
instance, got home in Oklahoma as opposed to on the

21:03.496 --> 21:10.907
coast? Yes. You didn't have near the animosity 
that you felt on the coast that you did at home. But

21:21.282 --> 21:25.468
it wouldn't necessarily still describe it as a 
welcome other than with your family. Yeah, that's

21:26.590 --> 21:28.152
true. Family and friends, of course, welcome you 
home. Right. Some people were curious and would

21:33.280 --> 21:38.785
ask, but you didn't really. There is no other 
welcome besides that. This great job thing you

21:41.848 --> 21:45.271
mentioned just didn't turn up very often. No, not 
at all. Okay.

21:51.917 --> 21:58.623
After you returned to the States, did you feel you 
had to explain your reasons for going to Vietnam or

21:51.917 --> 21:58.623
your actions while you were there? Sort of just 
avoided the subject. I tried not to explain too

22:03.149 --> 22:11.620
much because you sort of ended up on the losing end 
of any battle that you got into. If nothing else, by

22:13.102 --> 22:21.293
sheer numbers of people that were talking to you, 
unless you were one-on-one, but I don't know.

22:21.313 --> 22:26.600
Yeah, you maybe felt a little guilty or whatever 
about going. Okay.

22:30.766 --> 22:32.548
Did you feel the... that the citizens' attitudes 
about the war were informed, or were they, for

22:32.984 --> 22:46.262
instance, tired of the whole thing, or avoiding 
the whole issue because of some hidden guilt of

22:32.984 --> 22:46.262
their own?

22:49.527 --> 22:53.192
The media informed everybody every day. I think 
people were tired of the war, and they wanted to see

22:53.212 --> 22:56.877
it over. It was enough for nothing else to quit 
seeing it on the news every night. They definitely

23:00.683 --> 23:02.485
got an upfront view. from what I saw on the news.

23:08.306 --> 23:09.867
Yeah, it was. We had the running statistic of the 
daily body count and all of this. And I don't know

23:16.595 --> 23:20.280
what all it seemed, as I recall, every night. So 
maybe that, like I say, the people, they were just

23:22.943 --> 23:32.134
too busy with their own lives to even listen maybe. 
about the questions of the whys of the Vietnam War?

23:37.229 --> 23:40.013
Yeah, I don't know how informed the people were. 
Like I said, I talked to very few people, really,

23:40.073 --> 23:43.017
about Vietnam. I sort of tried to avoid the issue, 
as a matter of fact. Okay. All right, now then, the

23:49.867 --> 23:55.135
last question that we have is the biggie. And this 
is, do you recall the songs that were played in

23:55.155 --> 24:00.964
Vietnam? And... Were they important to you 
because of what they reminded you of, or were they

24:02.995 --> 24:13.811
important because of the way they reflected, or 
because they reflected the way you felt at the

24:02.995 --> 24:13.811
time? The song I remember the biggest is Country 
Joe and the Fish, singing, oh, send your boy off to

24:15.914 --> 24:25.689
Vietnam. I can't remember the name of the song. But 
I get, I don't know, we had a lot of, thongs that you

24:31.750 --> 24:41.186
heard, it was just sort of a release mechanism to, 
uh, because you were scared to use. So I, I don't

24:41.427 --> 24:43.470
know. I remember you're going home in the body bag 
and I remember the country Joe and the fish song.

24:48.619 --> 24:53.648
Um, guys, I remember the thongs that were over 
there. I remember the hair, uh, The play here was

24:57.738 --> 25:00.581
out and we had the soundtrack to that. You heard 
that a lot. But as far as identifying with all the

25:04.244 --> 25:14.173
feelings of the songs and so forth, I can't really 
remember any songs that we clung onto at all.

25:17.476 --> 25:26.344
As far as, well, I guess there was a lot of songs 
against the war at that time, against war period,

25:28.602 --> 25:34.691
that

25:28.602 --> 25:34.691
I don't really remember any that I can find on to. 
Okay, well, that is all the questions that I had at

25:37.395 --> 25:41.981
this time. And is there anything else you can think 
of that you might want to add? No. All right, well,

25:50.133 --> 25:51.655
Alan, I appreciate it. Okay. And...
