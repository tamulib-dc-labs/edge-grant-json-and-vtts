00:02.275 --> 00:07.421
In 1968, they were starting to use more of shots that were made in Germany.

00:08.262 --> 00:10.865
And as you can imagine, the Germans were a little more precise.

00:10.925 --> 00:17.673
They were steel and they were turned and were much rounder and smoother.

00:17.753 --> 00:20.756
And generally, I never did like those as well.

00:20.896 --> 00:23.079
They just felt slippery to me or something.

00:23.279 --> 00:26.002
I liked the ones that had a little bit of imperfection in it.

00:26.543 --> 00:32.029
But I did throw one from time to time because when you go to the games, they make you throw those kinds.

00:32.009 --> 00:34.573
Now, the weight I know is measured.

00:34.653 --> 00:35.995
What about the dimensions?

00:36.075 --> 00:46.531
The size, there's a minimum and maximum, and there's a little leeway in there, and it doesn't look like much difference, but it feels a lot different.

00:49.074 --> 00:59.670
And let's see, you never, did you ever get to a meet and the shot that you had planned to use at that meet was not there?

00:59.650 --> 01:02.074
Not that I remember because I carried it with me.

01:03.316 --> 01:03.416
Okay.

01:03.436 --> 01:08.203
Now at the Olympics, did you use your shot?

01:08.224 --> 01:09.325
No, they didn't allow us to.

01:09.405 --> 01:10.447
They furnished the shots.

01:11.108 --> 01:14.233
They did get us, the U.S.

01:14.253 --> 01:24.409
team, all of the sizes and brands that they would be using to train with a couple months before.

01:24.389 --> 01:27.319
And sizes, meaning there were some variations?

01:27.379 --> 01:30.911
Yes, and diameter, a little bit different diameters on them.

01:31.212 --> 01:32.817
Did you like the smaller or the larger?

01:32.898 --> 01:34.483
I usually went with the larger.

01:36.556 --> 01:42.486
And then the outside was polished or did it have kind of ridges in it?

01:42.506 --> 01:45.691
The German tool ones had little fine ridges in it.

01:46.312 --> 01:53.123
The cast ones would have obvious where the seam was and it's built up and welded a little bit and smoothed down.

01:53.945 --> 01:55.167
Had a little different feel to it.

01:55.727 --> 02:02.158
Generally by the 68 they started using the ones that had been turned and were perfectly round.

02:02.932 --> 02:03.774
A little different feel.

02:03.814 --> 02:04.655
You had to get used to it.

02:04.815 --> 02:06.298
I had a little trouble getting used to them.

02:06.438 --> 02:09.364
And after you do, it's all right.

02:09.384 --> 02:19.001
In all of your shot putting, did you ever drop a shot on yourself and bruise or mash anything or on anybody else?

02:20.143 --> 02:26.695
No, I hit a guy with a shot put one time.

02:26.675 --> 02:31.619
that was a football player at A&M that was cutting through the area.

02:33.140 --> 02:34.922
And he didn't do it anymore.

02:35.783 --> 02:38.405
Didn't do any permanent damage to him, a guy named Doug McLean.

02:41.407 --> 02:43.830
He became a lawyer, which I'm not sure there's any connection there.

02:45.651 --> 02:56.260
As you look back over the whole, all of your shot putting, what were the important victory steps that you remember most?

02:57.792 --> 03:01.806
The first time I threw 60 feet with a 16-pound shot.

03:02.769 --> 03:03.632
Go back to high school.

03:03.692 --> 03:04.716
That was in high school.

03:04.736 --> 03:05.338
Oh, okay.

03:05.740 --> 03:08.263
And I was out practicing by myself.

03:10.405 --> 03:14.770
That was before, that was just after I graduated from high school.

03:16.312 --> 03:25.663
Going back to high school, the 64, first state record in the shot put, 64 feet was the memorable one.

03:26.344 --> 03:29.908
Do you remember when you first won a shot put?

03:31.137 --> 03:37.673
Yes, I was in the 8th grade and I beat the 9th graders.

03:38.976 --> 03:41.643
And that would have been with the 12 pound or was there a lighter one?

03:41.663 --> 03:42.384
It was a 12 pound.

03:42.404 --> 03:42.665
Okay.

03:45.011 --> 03:47.998
And then the first year you won at the state was your...

03:48.755 --> 03:49.996
No, I'll take that back.

03:50.016 --> 03:51.257
That would have been an eight-pound shot.

03:51.438 --> 03:51.878
Oh, okay.

03:51.958 --> 03:52.999
Eight-pound junior high.

03:53.700 --> 03:58.104
And when I was in eighth, ninth, then tenth grade I started throwing the 12-pound.

03:58.744 --> 04:09.955
And I was throwing an Amarillo, a meet in Amarillo, and the best shot putter was a ninth grader from the other junior high in Pampa, which is the first year we had two.

04:11.156 --> 04:15.080
And I won that meet over there, and I was only an eighth grader throwing.

04:15.100 --> 04:18.643
We didn't have enough to have an eighth and ninth grade team, so I threw with the ninth graders.

04:20.260 --> 04:23.587
And then in high school, when did you first win?

04:24.710 --> 04:32.147
Well, my first year I was throwing 53 feet, which was about the third best in the district.

04:32.167 --> 04:34.973
And then I re-injured a broken foot that I had from football.

04:35.073 --> 04:39.062
I broke it in basketball, re-injured it, and had to drop out of track.

04:39.650 --> 04:47.447
At that point, when I threw 53 feet, I had beat the two guys that were leading the district.

04:47.487 --> 04:50.314
So I had hopes of getting to go to regional that year.

04:51.035 --> 04:55.205
They had thrown 55 feet, but every time I'd compete against them, I'd beat them.

04:55.225 --> 04:58.131
So I had hopes in that foot injury.

04:58.313 --> 05:03.741
kept me out of the rest of that season and kept me out of football the next fall.

05:03.761 --> 05:18.583
It affected basketball some but it also gave me some time though to decide that I really want to be a shot putter I think.

05:19.998 --> 05:32.826
All right, this determination that you developed, this self-determination, did anybody in high school and family or coach or anything help to?

05:33.278 --> 05:34.039
create that?

05:34.299 --> 05:34.759
Not really.

05:34.799 --> 05:41.866
The main motivation that I got was with my high school coach, Dwayne Lyons, that I mentioned earlier.

05:42.847 --> 05:47.852
But that was after I'd already really developed an interest in doing this thing.

05:47.932 --> 05:49.914
And I liked working out by myself.

05:50.014 --> 05:54.398
I liked throwing against a tape measure instead of some judges trying to decide whether it was a good throw or not.

05:55.419 --> 05:58.201
And by then, I liked doing it.

05:58.401 --> 06:00.363
And I liked trying to throw it a little farther.

06:01.064 --> 06:02.205
And so it was never.

06:02.675 --> 06:07.281
I've always felt guilty because talking about determination and drive, it's something I enjoyed.

06:07.381 --> 06:09.964
I mean you know some people like playing golf or going fishing.

06:10.084 --> 06:14.049
I really liked training and trying to throw further.

06:15.250 --> 06:16.131
So it wasn't work.

06:16.231 --> 06:16.772
It wasn't work.

06:16.932 --> 06:18.554
It wasn't work.

06:19.455 --> 06:22.939
Now I know that your faith means a lot to you.

06:22.999 --> 06:25.122
Did you ever say any prayers?

06:26.148 --> 06:30.193
Yeah, I did, but it was kind of interesting.

06:30.273 --> 06:33.376
I always felt guilty about praying about winning.

06:33.997 --> 06:34.858
I never could do that.

06:35.539 --> 06:37.601
I felt like that's kind of selfish.

06:37.621 --> 06:43.808
But I always had this little prayer to do my best, and everybody do their best, and I thought I'd win.

06:43.828 --> 06:45.710
So if everybody did their best, I thought I'd win.

06:45.750 --> 06:47.072
That was kind of a back doorway.

06:47.232 --> 06:48.173
Where did you say that?

06:49.823 --> 06:51.145
In your room?

06:51.325 --> 06:54.008
No, no, to myself when I was getting ready to go.

06:54.028 --> 06:57.813
I always said, you know, I wanted to do my best.

06:58.013 --> 07:01.217
And you never did kneel down like some of the football players?

07:01.437 --> 07:02.799
No, I didn't do that.

07:02.819 --> 07:06.563
I did one time in a public way because I was kind of a private person.

07:08.225 --> 07:15.234
And it was more of a relief thing in 1968 when the last thrower had finished and I had won.

07:15.714 --> 07:17.316
And I said, it's over.

07:17.903 --> 07:24.232
And I didn't realize until then the pressure that my whole career would have been a failure if I didn't win the gold medal.

07:24.252 --> 07:27.337
I didn't throw well that day, wasn't happy with my performance.

07:27.357 --> 07:34.547
And the feeling that I had when I got on the stand that day was relief that it's over and I can't take that away.

07:34.587 --> 07:37.131
And now my career is complete, so.

07:37.151 --> 07:40.536
There's a stigma for a world record holder.

07:41.123 --> 07:43.646
in track and fields never to win a gold medal.

07:43.666 --> 07:45.188
There's a stigma that goes with that.

07:45.609 --> 07:49.433
And, you know, you win a gold medal but never be a world record holder.

07:49.674 --> 07:51.196
But they can't take the medal away from you.

07:51.216 --> 07:53.438
They take a record away from you pretty quick sometimes.

07:54.820 --> 07:55.060
All right.

07:55.201 --> 07:58.084
Let's do that whole Olympic year.

07:59.986 --> 08:02.490
It's Mexico City and it's in the summer?

08:03.791 --> 08:05.233
It's in September.

08:05.393 --> 08:05.974
Oh, September.

08:06.354 --> 08:06.875
All right.

08:06.895 --> 08:10.860
Start back that spring and just describe that whole year.

08:10.840 --> 08:31.127
Well I started out, I took it real easy indoors because it would be a long year and I'm trying to pace myself and I'm heavily favored, I'm probably as heavily favored to win the gold medal as any American athlete because by then I'd thrown 71, five and a half,

08:31.546 --> 08:32.890
No one else had thrown 70.

08:33.170 --> 08:34.033
I'd won everything.

08:34.053 --> 08:37.262
I'd gone almost undefeated since the last Olympics.

08:38.284 --> 08:44.020
And so I told myself I don't want to peak too soon.

08:44.455 --> 08:47.538
I came out the first big outdoor meet.

08:47.558 --> 09:10.480
I waited late because I wasn't competing, I was competing unattached so I waited until in April, late in April to go for my first outdoor meet and it was at Mount San Antonio in California and I went out there and I tried not to be in perfect throwing shape but I've been lifting hard and I was in good shape and I threw 69-10.

09:11.725 --> 09:19.194
And mentally I said, you better slow down, you're going to peak too soon, which was a big mistake because then it took me a while to get back.

09:20.075 --> 09:25.422
Matter of fact, that turned out to be in 1968 my best meat throw.

09:26.363 --> 09:36.275
And so I kind of went through a period in there where I was getting a little anxious about it and I was inconsistent and I never quite got back in the rhythm when I did that.

09:37.536 --> 09:38.998
I went to the trials.

09:39.637 --> 09:41.719
in Lake Tahoe.

09:42.000 --> 09:48.366
They built special tracks up at Lake Tahoe to be at the same altitude as Mexico City.

09:48.387 --> 09:50.749
I think it was about 6,500, 7,000 feet.

09:51.610 --> 09:54.633
And so we had to go out there and train at altitude to get used.

09:54.653 --> 09:56.395
Everybody was scared to death about altitude.

09:56.415 --> 09:59.839
It's going to kill the distance runners and it's going to mess up everybody else's performance.

10:00.440 --> 10:07.247
Turned out not to do that, but everybody was, you know, you're reading stories about how distance runners are going to drop dead.

10:07.227 --> 10:10.096
Well, so we went out there and trained early.

10:10.638 --> 10:16.396
So you're in an environment that's close and in some ways made the pressure build.

10:17.159 --> 10:18.182
In the trials,

10:19.411 --> 10:23.576
I'm physically ready, but I'm just inconsistent for me.

10:25.177 --> 10:26.679
And I threw 67.

10:27.000 --> 10:28.361
I threw terrible.

10:28.381 --> 10:30.343
The shot was coming out the side of my hand.

10:30.363 --> 10:34.448
It wasn't coming out right, and it was going over 67 feet every time.

10:35.029 --> 10:40.695
But I finished third behind Dave Maggard and George Woods, and Steinhauer wasn't far behind for fourth.

10:40.715 --> 10:42.617
If I'd have finished fourth, I'd have stayed home.

10:43.492 --> 10:50.059
I realized, it was almost a shock to me, I realized that, you know, what could happen.

10:50.079 --> 10:52.810
So after that,

10:53.735 --> 11:01.044
I went into really hard training and I was throwing 68 feet in practice which was way over what I'd normally do.

11:01.064 --> 11:01.926
Now you were living where?

11:02.246 --> 11:02.887
Stayed out there.

11:03.227 --> 11:03.748
I didn't leave.

11:03.768 --> 11:06.391
I stayed at altitude until we went straight to Mexico City.

11:07.112 --> 11:11.017
I got down to Mexico City and it was kind of a circus atmosphere.

11:11.057 --> 11:14.742
You worked out in this practice stadium and they had all kinds of people watching you.

11:14.762 --> 11:18.527
There was no place to get off by yourself like it was in Tokyo in practice.

11:18.507 --> 11:24.940
So you'd go out there and it'd just be a crowd gathering and your competitors would show up and it'd be a competition.

11:25.241 --> 11:29.550
And I was throwing around at 70 feet in practice and I was really ready physically.

11:30.472 --> 11:37.647
Well then they came, they really, Mexico was the first,

11:39.668 --> 11:41.430
Olympics where they did a drug test.

11:43.172 --> 11:46.876
And the only reason that was a concern was caffeine's on the list.

11:48.317 --> 11:51.421
So they had us afraid if you drink two cups of coffee, you might fail the test.

11:51.441 --> 11:52.682
If you drink one, you might not.

11:52.762 --> 11:55.946
So obviously for about three days, you didn't drink any.

11:55.966 --> 11:57.527
And, you know, that was an adjustment.

11:57.768 --> 11:59.830
Cokes, you went off Cokes.

11:59.850 --> 12:00.931
You're afraid to take aspirin.

12:03.454 --> 12:09.000
We kind of got in a little habit of taking pills, sleeping pills to help you sleep.

12:10.145 --> 12:15.514
They used to give them to us at A&M, you know, not for a basketball game or track meets.

12:15.534 --> 12:16.636
You could get them from the trainer.

12:17.838 --> 12:19.380
It wasn't illegal or anything.

12:20.903 --> 12:23.247
But they said they may have something in it.

12:23.267 --> 12:23.848
You better not.

12:24.890 --> 12:26.633
Well, so you became paranoid.

12:26.653 --> 12:29.858
Well, the living conditions in Mexico were three guys to a room.

12:30.378 --> 12:34.642
in a room that was just, you could touch all the beds.

12:34.983 --> 12:39.488
And I had Maggard in there, who was my friend, but competitor, and he beat me in the trials.

12:39.548 --> 12:46.375
And I had Ed Burke, a hammer thrower, and his events were several days after ours, so he wasn't as uptight as we were.

12:47.236 --> 12:58.107
And frankly, I got in, I don't know, you know, all that, but the night before the qualifying, I didn't sleep hardly at all.

12:58.643 --> 13:08.914
But I went out and I threw like 67-10 with my sweats on, just took an easy throw and that's qualified you to get in the regular competition.

13:08.934 --> 13:15.921
So I'm way ahead of everybody and that throw would easily win or have a, you know, good shot.

13:15.961 --> 13:17.723
It would be hard for somebody to throw.

13:17.763 --> 13:19.165
So I know I can throw farther than that.

13:19.185 --> 13:21.207
Well, we go back and we have to spend another night.

13:21.247 --> 13:24.290
Now in Tokyo, you qualify in the morning to compete in the afternoon.

13:24.590 --> 13:27.013
Well, they did it two days there.

13:28.580 --> 13:31.525
have to approach it differently on how far you taper down.

13:31.585 --> 13:34.550
You want to rest but you don't want to rest too much.

13:36.132 --> 13:43.724
So you take a day off for the qualifying because I've seen people favored to win the Olympics never get out of the qualifying round.

13:43.744 --> 13:45.287
Just take it for granted they're going to do it.

13:45.327 --> 13:47.811
So you have to be prepared a little bit.

13:48.632 --> 13:52.478
Well then you've got another day that you really haven't done much.

13:52.897 --> 13:57.181
And I didn't sleep well again, once again, because they're going to take all this big drug test.

13:57.201 --> 14:00.984
So I was not in the best mental frame that I should be.

14:01.384 --> 14:04.127
Then I was feeding the pressure of not to win but not to lose.

14:04.927 --> 14:07.149
My whole approach was don't lose this thing.

14:07.850 --> 14:09.171
And was your wife, your parents?

14:09.351 --> 14:09.932
They came down.

14:10.172 --> 14:10.672
They got down.

14:10.833 --> 14:11.613
I didn't see them much.

14:12.014 --> 14:14.896
I stayed in the village, and they stayed downtown.

14:15.036 --> 14:17.939
Did you talk to them during those days of high pressure?

14:17.999 --> 14:20.581
A day or two before I got to see them, they came in and visited.

14:20.661 --> 14:22.903
And that was a help because I got away from it a little bit.

14:22.883 --> 14:36.683
Then I went out in the day of the competition and I threw like 67, four and a half or five in there on my first throw.

14:37.664 --> 14:40.448
And I said, well, at least that's a safe mark.

14:40.509 --> 14:43.673
It takes the pressure off that way, but that's not going to win it for me.

14:44.514 --> 14:47.939
Well, Woods, my biggest competitor is Woods and Maggard.

14:47.959 --> 14:48.600
Maggard's sick.

14:48.620 --> 14:49.802
He can barely throw.

14:49.782 --> 15:01.180
Woods 366 1⁄2 inch and the German, I think it's the German or the Russian, I can't even remember now.

15:03.324 --> 15:08.652
It's East German through 6511 and then we go in the second round.

15:08.969 --> 15:12.695
and I'm throwing ahead of them, and I throw 67, low 67s.

15:12.755 --> 15:16.001
I don't improve, and they throw terrible, 63 or 4.

15:16.542 --> 15:18.605
We go the next round, I throw right at 67.

15:19.146 --> 15:21.410
They throw even worse, and the competition's over.

15:21.911 --> 15:22.652
I don't improve.

15:22.692 --> 15:23.534
They don't improve.

15:23.554 --> 15:30.285
I was disappointed in the distance, but it was just a relief when I got on the victory stand finally.

15:30.974 --> 15:34.899
It was just a feeling I had was not of excitement to jump up and down and say, it's over.

15:34.959 --> 15:38.603
I mean, no one, you know, my career is complete.

15:39.885 --> 15:58.348
And looking back, I really would have liked to have thrown 70 feet in the Olympics, even though that throw was still an Olympic record and an Olympic record, but it's not as good as I should have thrown and not normally what you'd think would have to take to win in the Olympics, even though the Olympics are tough sometimes because there's a lot of pressure.

15:59.088 --> 16:12.025
I remember walking out of the stadium and Jay Sylvester, who was a good discus thrower and was throwing against Al Order and some other good discus throwers, said, you ought to be ashamed of throwing that in the Olympics.

16:12.726 --> 16:18.273
And I remember saying, Sylvester, you better not say anything now until it's all over because all it counts is getting that gold.

16:18.473 --> 16:19.534
He'd never gotten a gold medal.

16:19.554 --> 16:22.378
He'd been favored in two different Olympics and he's favored to win this one.

16:23.995 --> 16:26.478
And he got beat by order again in the Olympics.

16:26.538 --> 16:28.300
Order won his fourth gold medal there.

16:29.301 --> 16:31.803
And that's just the way the Olympics are.

16:31.824 --> 16:38.811
You know, and you have to be, you know, a Jim Ryan never won a gold medal and was the greatest miler up to that time there had ever been.

16:39.952 --> 16:41.554
So it was a feeling of relief.

16:42.195 --> 16:48.822
Then we go to take the drug test because we hadn't had caffeine, we hadn't had sleep, hadn't had aspirin, hadn't had anything.

16:50.692 --> 16:52.354
They didn't know about any drug tests.

16:53.776 --> 16:56.079
So, well, what are we supposed to do?

16:56.439 --> 17:01.045
You know, as soon as the ceremony's over, you're supposed to have a drug test.

17:01.065 --> 17:03.589
And so we wait around, wait around.

17:03.609 --> 17:07.333
They don't speak English very well, and we sure don't speak Mexican.

17:07.373 --> 17:10.978
So after about an hour, we all leave and go to the village.

17:11.735 --> 17:25.970
Two days later, we get a phone call or a message in our box, come take your test after we've been drinking coffee, you know, taking pills to sleep and muscle relaxers, whatever.

17:26.651 --> 17:31.216
And so as far as I know, I never went over there and I don't think any others did.

17:31.977 --> 17:37.523
But, you know, as far as enjoying it, what happened then shortly after that,

17:38.262 --> 17:43.509
was the black power demonstrations at the Olympics by the American athletes and the media.

17:43.849 --> 17:54.483
I don't think I had one question about what it felt like to win the gold medal or, you know, are you satisfied with it or what was it like is what did you think about the demonstrations?

17:54.723 --> 17:55.965
It was a no-win deal for us.

17:56.866 --> 17:59.950
We hid out until finally I couldn't

18:00.588 --> 18:02.951
It's just unbearable with the media.

18:03.371 --> 18:05.053
And because I like some of those guys.

18:06.034 --> 18:08.257
And I lived in Texas in the 60s.

18:08.317 --> 18:10.660
And if you got up and said, well, they had a right to do that at the Olympics.

18:10.680 --> 18:12.022
They've been mistreated.

18:12.042 --> 18:12.943
Well, I got to go home.

18:14.585 --> 18:21.993
Or I didn't want to come across like a racist or something, you know, because they were my friends.

18:22.073 --> 18:27.760
And so I took the brave way out and I went to the officials and said, I'm going home.

18:28.301 --> 18:29.262
And they said, you can't.

18:30.035 --> 18:35.347
You got to go home with the charter which leaves after the games and you're expected to go to certain things."

18:35.367 --> 18:39.476
I said, okay.

18:40.237 --> 18:42.863
So I went back, packed my bags, went out to the airport.

18:43.670 --> 18:49.197
Scraped up $88 and got on an airplane and flew to Houston, Texas, and they're still looking for me down there.

18:49.517 --> 18:50.378
And I came home.

18:51.700 --> 18:58.589
Now, back in the Olympic Village where you athletes were living, what was happening in the black-white?

18:59.149 --> 19:02.594
There wasn't any tension between the black and white athletes.

19:03.695 --> 19:05.357
They were getting a lot of pressure from...

19:05.793 --> 19:14.462
people like hired Cosell, what are you guys going to do, Edwards, Harry Edwards, the sociology professor of San Jose, about you need to make a statement.

19:14.943 --> 19:16.244
Some of them did it reluctantly.

19:16.384 --> 19:18.106
Some of them felt it was a thing to do.

19:20.689 --> 19:24.954
It was a sad time because they took their medals away from them and sent them home.

19:24.974 --> 19:33.623
And when you stood on that platform, as they put that gold medal around your neck and they played the national anthem, how did you feel about that?

19:34.497 --> 19:38.060
It was a good feeling because it's something, you know, that was a milestone.

19:38.140 --> 19:40.742
But it was a feeling of relief for me.

19:42.404 --> 19:52.292
Not like it was when I got the silver medal in 64 with excitement and the thrill of that and then watching them do the gold medal and playing the national anthem for the winter.

19:53.053 --> 19:55.395
I wanted that and I thought about it every day after that.

19:55.835 --> 19:59.878
But when I finally got there, it was more of a feeling of relief.

20:00.059 --> 20:02.701
And I probably should have handled that different.

20:02.721 --> 20:04.082
I probably should have approached it

20:04.585 --> 20:08.891
not so much at the end of the world and enjoyed the experience a little more.

20:10.153 --> 20:15.060
In hindsight, was that 64 silver medal one of the greatest incentives you ever had?

20:16.002 --> 20:16.482
Incentives?

20:16.763 --> 20:18.365
To try harder?

20:18.545 --> 20:21.029
I think so, but that was one of the greatest enjoyments I had.

20:21.990 --> 20:29.361
You know, I threw my best in a competition where I wasn't expected to do that well and against the best in the world.

20:30.033 --> 20:41.290
And, you know, I think generally in my career I was more satisfied with throwing my best than I was where I ended up when I was younger.

20:41.330 --> 20:45.557
If I threw an inch farther than I'd ever thrown, no matter what place I got, I was happier.

20:45.977 --> 20:49.944
Where did you put that gold medal that night back in the village?

20:49.964 --> 20:53.509
Well, some of the athletes lost them.

20:53.489 --> 20:56.131
they finally gave us a safe or something to put in.

20:56.151 --> 21:01.236
Some of them put them under their mattress and stuff like that, but some of the athletes had them stolen and you can't be replaced.

21:02.257 --> 21:07.481
So, if I remember right, they had a safe for us to go back.

21:07.501 --> 21:07.701
All right.

21:07.721 --> 21:09.883
Then when you got on the plane, where was it?

21:10.003 --> 21:10.444
I carried it.

21:10.804 --> 21:12.446
I carried it on the plane in my bag.

21:12.626 --> 21:13.306
You didn't check it?

21:13.487 --> 21:14.027
No.

21:14.047 --> 21:14.307
No.

21:14.868 --> 21:18.711
And then when you got home, who did you show it to first?

21:20.032 --> 21:20.873
I don't remember that.

21:20.933 --> 21:23.175
You know, I flew to Houston.

21:24.067 --> 21:28.112
and drove up to A&M and was honored at the halftime of the Arkansas football game.

21:29.154 --> 21:40.909
And it was President Rudder was out there and President of the student body who later became a good friend of mine, Bill Carter, Coach Thomas out there.

21:41.910 --> 21:54.006
And I didn't realize it at the time, but when I got home after that they presented me a plaque and when I got home

21:54.830 --> 22:02.280
And President Rudder sent me a note and a little photo album of the occasion with the Aggie band out there, they'd spell my name out.

22:02.300 --> 22:05.565
And that's one of my most cherished photographs I have today.

22:05.585 --> 22:06.146
They spelled it wrong?

22:06.166 --> 22:10.011
No, they put my name, they spelled my name out on the field in the Aggie band.

22:10.572 --> 22:13.436
And that didn't happen very many times in history.

22:13.456 --> 22:20.145
And I didn't know it until I got the photograph because I was out there on the field and you couldn't see what they had spelled out.

22:21.458 --> 22:42.994
Now during those years that you were competing at the level of the world's best, you didn't turn much to any coach for their advice, but what role did Coach Thomas play in your career?

22:43.396 --> 22:50.624
You know Coach Thomas, his background was sprinters and sprinting and he was very upfront with me.

22:51.145 --> 22:56.812
I don't have a great deal of depth, experience with shot putters.

22:56.872 --> 22:58.133
We've had good shot putters here.

22:59.395 --> 23:00.556
Amo Mameliga was here.

23:00.596 --> 23:08.425
He was not a great shot put technician coach because he'd never done that, but he could get you ready to throw it as well as anybody

23:09.046 --> 23:13.071
in my opinion, for me, as well as anyone could have.

23:14.633 --> 23:24.145
But I think from my high school coach giving me the foundation, Dwayne Lines, I think I got most of what I got working on my own.

23:24.185 --> 23:30.092
Now there's one coach that helped me in 64, 68, and

23:30.258 --> 23:42.613
I would consult with from time to time, and if I had an opportunity to spend more time with him, I think I might have thrown further, and that was Peyton Jordan, who was a coach at Stanford, Olympic coach.

23:44.146 --> 23:52.676
and I worked well together and, you know, the problem you'd have with coaches is there was little different philosophies and you couldn't jump from one to the other.

23:52.696 --> 24:06.292
You had to get it, find something, believe in it and ours kind of meshed together and he took what I was doing and he had the ability to look at me throwing and see the parts and I could look at film and wasn't very good.

24:06.352 --> 24:07.774
I'm not a very good shot put coach.

24:08.311 --> 24:14.060
Watching it, I have to look at their arm or see what they're doing or their leg and miss the other.

24:14.441 --> 24:16.183
He could sit back and look at the whole throw.

24:16.424 --> 24:32.328
And I'll tell you, though, there was another coach that helped me while I was at A&M, and he spent very little time with me because by then he was in his 70s, and that was Coach Andy, Coach Frank Anderson.

24:32.348 --> 24:33.730
He came out and worked with me.

24:34.371 --> 24:36.715
He helped me probably more in the discus than anyone.

24:37.589 --> 24:40.345
he came out and told me that I wasn't keeping my arm back.

24:40.466 --> 24:45.253
And I said, yeah, but I hear you saying that, but how do I do it?

24:45.638 --> 24:47.520
And he said, well, just lock it back there.

24:47.560 --> 24:55.567
Make your tricep against your lap back there and just stick it back there and don't let it come up.

24:56.107 --> 24:59.310
And I threw 15 feet farther than I'd ever thrown while he was out there with me.

25:00.371 --> 25:03.534
And through the rest of my career, I tried to remember that.

25:03.554 --> 25:07.958
And he would come out from time to time and critique me a little bit and did help me some.

25:07.978 --> 25:11.561
Describe Colonel Indy's personality and his style of doing things.

25:11.581 --> 25:15.645
Well, he was kind of a feisty little guy, but...

25:15.625 --> 25:21.554
But he was, at least for me, a positive coach.

25:21.574 --> 25:24.979
He'd get in there and, you know, that's good, but you can do it a little better.

25:25.139 --> 25:26.581
And Peyton Jordan is the same way.

25:26.601 --> 25:27.983
No, that isn't the way to do it.

25:28.604 --> 25:31.208
That's close, but here if you do this, it's going to even be better.

25:31.929 --> 25:34.332
So he made you feel like you were heading in the right direction.

25:34.433 --> 25:36.756
I think more coaches need to do that today, I think.

25:37.259 --> 25:40.703
a lot of football and basketball coaches could benefit from being more positive.

25:42.185 --> 25:45.569
I would like to say, I didn't finish about Coach Thomas.

25:45.589 --> 25:45.949
Oh, I'm sorry.

25:46.029 --> 25:49.233
Even though he didn't really get out there.

25:49.293 --> 25:55.721
One time he came by and I'm throwing, and being a little honoree, I turn around and say, Coach, what did it look like?

25:56.822 --> 25:58.944
He said, looks good, it's just not quite far enough.

25:59.625 --> 26:01.908
And I said, okay, I'll try to throw it further.

26:02.308 --> 26:05.612
And it's not a bad coaching philosophy, just...

26:05.913 --> 26:28.174
let me work it out to get it farther and uh but on the other hand he gave me an environment that i was very comfortable in he protected me from outside things he never used me in any way i remember he felt really bad one time he came to me and said that

26:29.723 --> 26:35.339
that they really wanted me to come to the Drake relays, but I wanted to go to Mt.

26:35.419 --> 26:35.840
SAC.

26:35.940 --> 26:37.665
That's where all the big guys were at.

26:37.685 --> 26:42.940
And he said, well, they're going to give us like $1,500 to bring other guys.

26:43.274 --> 26:45.838
He said, but only you and I know that.

26:48.201 --> 26:51.525
See, and I could make money legally going to Mt.

26:51.545 --> 26:57.013
SAC, because in those days they could send you the money for a first-class plane ticket in three days per diem.

26:57.073 --> 27:03.181
I'd fly out late one day and come back and save the $25 a day per diem and make $50 off the ticket.

27:03.602 --> 27:06.165
And that was a lot of spending money back then, and it was all legal.

27:06.306 --> 27:08.068
And they changed the rules eventually.

27:08.088 --> 27:08.869
They couldn't do that.

27:09.009 --> 27:10.311
They'd give you tourists.

27:10.291 --> 27:14.568
and they had to buy the ticket and all this kind of thing to keep people from doing that.

27:15.512 --> 27:18.404
But I used to make my spending money doing that legally.

27:19.066 --> 27:21.195
And if I could go to two meets in a weekend,

27:21.833 --> 27:22.374
rack up.

27:24.497 --> 27:32.448
But I thought about that and he didn't put any pressure on me and I eventually felt like I was part of the team.

27:32.509 --> 27:41.421
I needed to go to Drake and we all flew on a plane up there together and I got to be with some of my teammates on a deal like that and it worked out for the best.

27:41.502 --> 27:46.289
But he never put any pressure on me to go do anything that I didn't want to do.

27:46.329 --> 27:49.393
He'd sit down with me and consult with me and tell me what he thought.

27:49.964 --> 27:52.570
And that would not have been the case at a lot of places.

27:52.790 --> 28:00.126
So that for you, his coaching technique... For me, his coaching technique enabled me to accomplish what I wanted to at A&M.

28:00.146 --> 28:02.952
I think that might not have been the case at a lot of places.

28:03.513 --> 28:05.798
And I'm thankful to him for that.

28:05.939 --> 28:09.306
All right, now my favorite...

28:11.615 --> 28:15.440
view of you throwing the shot occurred on April 22, 1967.

28:18.324 --> 28:19.787
Describe that for you.

28:19.847 --> 28:24.333
Well, that was my last official competition in Cowell Field, Randy Mattson Day.

28:25.635 --> 28:33.185
And they gave me a plaque and that's when I threw the world record, 71-5.

28:33.205 --> 28:34.327
Mr. S.M.

28:36.330 --> 28:40.035
Meeks was equipment guy in charge of facilities.

28:40.910 --> 28:54.108
And he came out and he was the only one that knew for sure that was a world record because I'd thrown 70 foot seven, but he put the line where it was short or long.

28:54.208 --> 28:56.091
He put the line longer than the old record.

28:56.111 --> 28:59.055
He knew if it hit the line that it was a record.

28:59.135 --> 29:00.376
He said that way I'd know first.

29:01.218 --> 29:06.485
And actually it went over the line and he said that he knew it was a world record first.

29:06.525 --> 29:10.410
But there was about 10,000 people they tell me in the stadium that day.

29:10.913 --> 29:15.357
and all of them in the end zone in my last official competition in Kyle Field.

29:16.158 --> 29:20.563
And General Rudder was there and made a presentation to me afterwards.

29:21.063 --> 29:23.806
Was that your first, did you set the record on the first throw?

29:24.527 --> 29:25.007
First throw.

29:25.167 --> 29:25.848
That's my thought.

29:26.489 --> 29:28.150
All right, and you also threw the disc that day.

29:28.170 --> 29:30.032
I threw the discus.

29:31.354 --> 29:33.756
And didn't you come close to the work?

29:35.218 --> 29:37.680
That was the day that I,

29:37.660 --> 29:39.202
I came close that day.

29:40.583 --> 29:45.688
